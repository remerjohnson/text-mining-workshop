Seven years after joining the fed-
eral class-action lawsuit against Enron 
Corporation in December 2001, the 
University of California will now 
begin distributing settlement funds 
of approximately $7 billion to nearly 
200,000 investors, both individual and 
institutional.

The suit marks the largest ever 
settlement of securities in class-action 
lawsuits with the university serving 
as lead plaintiff in the case, appointed 
by the United States District Court in 
February 2002. 

As lead plaintiff, the university was 
responsible for managing and oversee-
ing the litigation process and work-
ing with other investors in pursuing 
the case. The law firm Coughlin Stoia 
Geller Rudman and Robbins LLP rep-
resented the university. 

“We’re proud of our role in secur-
ing the largest recovery ever obtained 
for investors victimized by corporate 
fraud,” chief trial counsel Patrick J. 
Coughlin said in a statement. “The

LAWSUIT 
PAYOUT

Nurses at five University of 
California medical centers voted last 
week to pass an initiative authoriz-
ing a strike, responding to what 
the California Nurses Association 
calls the university’s unofficial pol-
icy of understaffing hospitals past 
the minimum required by the state, 
exhausting nurses and potentially 
endangering patients.

State law requires a minimum 
ratio of nurses to patients at all 
times, depending upon the condi-
tion of the patients being moni-
tored. 

Nurses like Geri Jenkins, an 
employee at the UCSD medical cen-
ter for 32 years and co-president of 
the CNA, allege that UC officials 
have been cutting staffing levels and 
stretching resources, forcing nurses 
to fill in extra hours, miss breaks 
and work under unsatisfactory con-
ditions to meet patients’ needs.

Jenkins said that at UCSD, which 
draws a significant annual profit for 
the university, there is no reason to 
maintain inadequate staffing levels 
or unsafe hospital conditions. 

“UCSD made $61 million in 
profit last year, so we don’t think it 
would be too much to ask to staff 
up for when a nurse goes on a lunch 

break,” Jenkins said. “It puts the 
patient and the nurse in an unsafe 
and unhealthy position.”

Jenkins added that the continual 
inflation of UC executive salaries is 
evidence of the university’s ability to 
pump more funding into bettering 
hospital conditions. 

“In light of all this financial crisis 
the executives get very large raises,” 
Jenkins said. “They have enough 
money to give their executives huge 
advantages so the CEOs have all 
the money to give raises and pen-
sions but not enough to make sure 
nurses can effectively take care of 
patients.”

Jenkins said the strike autho-
rization should serve primarily as 
a means of illustrating the gravity 
of the issue and hopes that univer-
sity officials adequately address the 
nurses’ concerns before a strike is 
necessary.

However, university officials 
claim the allegations are ground-
less. 

An official response from the UC 
Office of the President called the 
grievances an “unfair labor practice 
charge” and cited a past agreement 
between the university and CNA 
stipulating that staffing regulations 
were to be decided individually by 
each medical center. 

“CNA’s accusations that UC has 

bargained in bad faith are false, and 
the university believes there is no 
factual basis for CNA’s unfair labor 
practice [accusation],” UC spokes-
man Paul Schwartz said in a state-
ment.

According to Schwartz, the uni-
versity pays its nurses above state 
market value while offering exten-
sive medical and pension benefits. 

CNA representatives, however, 
claim that the university continues 
to cut corners around medical cen-
ter costs. 

The UC system reported a total 
profit of $227 million during the 
2007-08 fiscal year, with nearly $3.6 
billion in assets coming from its 
medical centers, a number the CNA 
cites as reason to route more fund-
ing toward university medical cen-
ters.

Nurses at the UCLA medical 
center expressed similar grievances 
last year, leading officials to increase 
staffing levels.

“At UCLA the nurses forced the 
[staffing] issue a year ago,” Jenkins 
said. “UCLA has the biggest hos-
pital in the system and the deals 
they worked out have lasted. They 
pleaded it was too costly, too, but it’s 
still making profit.”

UCOP Slashes Budget as State Funding Hits Low
Seeking to reduce 
internal costs, top office
implements employee 
severance program, 
redistributes funding.
By Yelena Akopian
Associate News Editor

In an attempt to deal with the 
state budget crisis and improve inter-
nal efficiency, the UC Office of the 
President has enacted a series of mea-
sures to downsize staff and restruc-
ture operations since November 
2008, cutting its current operating 
budget by $60.4 million.

The Office of the President, which 
serves as the central administrative 
office for the University of California, 
was able to decrease operating costs 
by transferring programs previously 
administered by the central office to 
UC campuses and initiating a volun-
tary employee buyout program.

“These efforts are part of the ongo-
ing efforts at UCOP to downsize and 
restructure the Office of the President,” 
UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said. 
“[The goal is] to be more efficient 
and better serve the campuses and to 
respond to the state budget situations 
as part of the university.”

Schwartz explained that non-
campus-specific programs such as 
the Continuing Education of the Bar 
Program — which provides servic-
es for UC-trained lawyers — were 
previously located at the central 

office but will now be moved else-
where. Roughly half of the central 
office’s total reported budget savings 
stemmed from such initiatives.

Schwartz emphasized the bud-
getary importance of cutting UCOP 
down to only its core programs. 

“[The Continuing Education of 
the Bar Program] really does not 
have anything to do with the core 

functions of the president’s office as 
the central administrative office,” 
Schwartz said. “That doesn’t need to 
be here and can be located elsewhere, 
[as well as] other kinds of academ-
ic programs that are systemwide or 
multicampus.”

The voluntary severance program, 
which examines a university employ-
ee’s current salary and number of 

years at UCOP to determine the size 
and nature of the buyout package, 
was accepted by 155 employees and is 
expected to save $5 million annually. 

Additional funds were also saved 
by restricting executive travel and 
decreasing consulting expenses 
while consolidating and reorganiz-

distribution of these funds is what 
it’s all about, getting billions of dol-
lars back in the hands of defrauded 
investors.”

The lawsuit alleged that between Oct. 
19, 1998, and Nov. 
27, 2001, investors 
who purchased 
Enron securities 
were defrauded by 
way of false finan-
cial statements that 
deceitfully inflated 
the  price of Enron 
stock. It was dur-
ing this period that 
the defendants 
— among them 
Enron’s accountants, bankers, senior 
executives and lawyers — were able to 
carry out illegal insider trading of up to 
$1.1 billion. 

The case was tried in the U.S. 
District Court for the southern dis-
trict of Texas in Houston. A settle-
ment allocation plan was approved in 
September 2008 and the distribution 
process will take place in stages over 

the next several months. 
The university announced Dec. 13 

that it had begun distributing $5 billion 
of the $7 billion awarded to claimants, 
with reimbursement amounts varying 
depending on the type of securities 

purchased and 
at what time the 
investment was 
made. During 
this initial dis-
tribution period, 
the university will 
receive $22 mil-
lion, 20 percent 
of its allowed loss 
of $109.4 million 
under the alloca-
tion plan. 

“We are extremely pleased to be 
returning these funds to the mem-
bers of the class,” UC general counsel 
Charles Robinson said in a statement. 
“Getting here has required a long and 
challenging effort, but the results for 
Enron investors are unprecedented.”

CURRENTS University to Receive $22M 
from Initial Settlement Payout

New laser-beam technology 
could revolutionize the irriga-
tion of crops in San Diego and 
beyond, according to a group of 
students at the Jacobs School of 
Engineering.

The research team led by assis-
tant professor of environmental 
engineering Jan Kleissl is using 
a large aperture scintillometer to 
measure the amount of water that 
crops lose to evaporation and the 
peak hours at which this loss 
occurs.

Many recent irrigation advance-
ments have addressed systems of 
water delivery, such as sprinklers, 
but Kleissl said state droughts 
have created a demand for more 
sophisticated methods of water 
conservation. 

The goal is to give farmers an 
accurate reading of how efficiently 
their crops use water, more so 
than any current technology pro-
vides.

“What’s new about our 

approach is the monitoring side 
of it,” Kleissl said. “We’re trying to 
improve on that.”

The scintillometer that Kleissl’s 
team is using focuses laser beams 
across a field and records changes 
in the air’s refractive index caused 
by fluctuations in temperature and 
humidity. 

Farmers can use this data to 
decrease irrigation during hours of 
high water loss.

Researchers placed the device 
on half of a UC-operated experi-
mental alfalfa farm roughly a half-
mile long and a quarter-mile wide 
to study the area for at least two 
years. The other half of the farm 
will be irrigated conventionally.

In addition to being especially 
thirsty, alfalfa is the most common 
crop in the Imperial Valley, where 
the average annual rainfall is fewer 
than three inches and tempera-
tures often exceed 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit for several months of 
the year.

If the tests show substantial 
water savings, Kleissl hopes to 
see scintillometers placed on 
farms across the state.

ing departments within the central 
administrative offices.

The total UCOP operating budget 
for 2008-09 now stands at $230.1 
million.

“This is a significant achievement 
made possible by the dedication and 
hard work of the staff at the Office 
of the President,” Executive Vice 
President of Business Operations 
Katie Lapp said. “Many participated 
in helping to design new consolidated 
units, and many more have shoul-
dered additional responsibilities as 
the work force has been reduced. It 
has been a painful and difficult time, 
yet the staff has continued to fulfill 
the mission of the university.”

The changes have been motivated 
partly by the state budget crisis and 
the resulting cuts to higher educa-
tion. The Office of the Governor 
estimates the current state debt to be  
approximately $16 billion, and UC 
funding has been cut by $132 million 
since last year. In November 2008, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger pro-
posed a series of additional midyear 
cuts, estimated at $60.5 million.

The Office of the President plans 
to continue to review its programs 
and services that could be delivered 
by campuses and third-party ven-
dors, and aims to reduce its work-
force by 275 positions and $25 mil-
lion by 2009-10.

“We have to wait and see and 
understand what the proposed budget 
[cuts] mean,” Schwartz said. “Clearly 
this is a very difficult budget environ-
ment. We are not yet done with the 
restructuring effort.”

UCSD’s 2009 
Resolutions: Less 
A.S. Waste, More 
Admin. Support
Now I know in the past I’ve used this column to degrade resolution making, 
even going so far as resolving to 
abandon the practice altogether, but 
for some reason this Jan. 1 felt just 
a little different. Yeah, I still spent 
the morning on the couch eating 
junk food and watching the Rose 
Parade, but there are a few shiny 
things hanging in the misty 2009 
future that weren’t there before. I’m 

not just talking about the incoming 
president (a huge upgrade silver-
lining basically everything else in 
national politics at the moment) 
this year also holds my last quarters 
at UCSD and the great big world 
beyond. So while I’m resolving to 
make the next two quarters some 
of my best, I also have some sug-
gestions for my campus peers to 
consider adding to their lists. 

A.S. Council, please resolve to 
tackle your bureaucratic laziness 
this year and give Tritons the stu-
dent government we deserve, not 
one that has trouble doing the bare 
minimum. With a new fee referen-
dum coming up in two weeks, you’ll 
already be focusing your efforts full 
force on getting students to bail 
you out. But what you should really 
be funneling this fresh enthusiasm 
toward is fixing the faulty practices 
that got you into this mess. I know 
it’s unrealistic to demand proactivity 
from a bunch of slate veterans whose 
backstage politicking maneuvered 
an election of unopposed races, but 
come on. Just because you and your 
20 best friends are able to make 
totally self-interested control moves 
with a basically unlimited budget, 
doesn’t mean you should. 

I challenge you to make 2009 the 
year of earning your title. And to 
save you the five months it will take 
to motion to form a subcommittee 
on the subject, form said commit-
tee, debate then table its findings 
for three weeks and finally pen an 
aptly titled yet ultimately toothless 
Resolution in Response to Guardian 
Columnist Remarks, I’ll even give 
you some starting ideas. 

Figure out this Grove Caffe mess, 
and check in on all those other 
floundering enterprises while you’re 
at it. Once you’ve got that under 
control, stop wasting money in gen-
eral. If you’re really running out of 
funding to the point that Sun God 
might be downsized (which you’re 
not, but that’s a different story) put 
yourselves on a spending diet by 
skipping the extravagant retreats 
and cutting back all those voluntary 
coalition memberships and lobby-
ing campaigns. Those projects are 
important, but not if you can’t pro-
vide for the campus first. And on 
the topic of Sun God: make sure it’s 
awesome, because after last year’s 
festival it’s pretty clear that Associate 
Vice President of Programming 
Garrett Berg can’t be trusted with 
oversight responsibility alone.

Stealing
the Shoes

Dear Editor,
California College Democrats 

have come out in strong support of 
a bridge loan for the Big Three auto 
companies, believing that the bill will 
not only help our ailing economy, but 
will also help create a clean energy 
economy as well. 

“We need to bail out the auto 
industry to protect jobs and our 
economy, but we also need to bail 
out our planet,” said Chrissy Elles, 
president of the Campus Democrats 
at UCSB. “We need an automaker 
bailout bill that will require Detroit to 
re-organize and begin to build clean, 
efficient cars that will help us reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.”

California College Democrats 
Political Director Charlie Carnow, 
who marched with the United Auto 
Workers in Los Angeles, stressed the 
importance of the bridge loan for our 
economy. 

“Can we afford to lose hundreds 
of thousands of good paying jobs in 
California?” Carnow said. “Hell no! 
We bailed out the banks, and now it’s 
time to take the first step to bail out 
hard-working Americans.”

According to a study by the 
Economic Policy Institute, failure of 
the Big 3 would put over 305,000 
California jobs at risk. By granting 
$15 billion in loans, the automaker 
bailout bill will save a total of 3.3 mil-
lion American jobs.

The link between the auto indus-
try and climate change is blatant. 

Transportation accounts for nearly 
30 percent of the United States green-
house gas emissions, according to 
the EPA.

“What I hope is that the auto-
maker bailout will help transition the 
blue-collar jobs of the auto indus-
try into green-collar jobs,” Elles said. 
“For years, Detroit has produced gas-
guzzling vehicles that threatened our 
energy security and contributed to 
global warming. Hopefully, this will 
be a new beginning for Detroit, and 
the environment.”

The California College 
Democrats support the bailout as 
the first step toward greening the 
economy and call for the auto “czar” 
to demonstrate a commitment to 
fuel efficiency, leading us toward the 
cars of the future.

Representative, California College 

Democrats

 
Dear Editor,

With the new year arriving there 
are a large number of December col-
lege graduates still trying to chart 
their career plan. There are no simple 
answers for those looking, but here 
are four things to consider:

1) Take a job where you will learn 
the most.

Pre-1980, college students took 
jobs where they thought they would 
get the most job security. They went 
to the big companies like IBM, GM 

and GE. In the ’80s and ’90s, college 
seniors started to focus on where they 
could make the most money, like Wall 
Street. In the 2000s, students focused 
on where they could enjoy the best 
lifestyle, like the dotcoms. Today, the 
focus should be on where you can 
learn the most. In the long run, the 
skills that you develop will enable you 
to get that next great job and chart a 
career path toward success.

2) Go broad and deep in your job 
search.

When times are tough, most 
people concentrate on going very 
broad in their job search. I would 
never deter a recent college graduate 
from pursuing any and every pos-
sible lead; however, you may find that 
your time is much better spent going 
deep instead of broad. Recent grads 
should focus on a specific indus-
try (e.g. retail, media, banking) or 
functional area (e.g. sales, market-
ing, finance) and get as smart as 
they can on that particular area. This 
means understanding all companies, 
required skills, current events and 
networking opportunities related to 
that area. There is a high correlation 
between focus and success when it 
comes to job hunting.

3) Look internationally.
Get your butt out of the coun-

try. This may mean studying for an 
extra year in an exchange program 
or taking a more menial type of job 
abroad. When working abroad, the 
specific industry or functional area 
is less relevant, because much of your 
learning will be cultural. Learning a 
language and how to interact profes-
sionally and socially in different cul-

tures is just as important as learning

of places to go include: China, India, 
Southern Africa and Brazil. These 
are big markets that are only going to 
become more important to the global 
economy.

4) Don’t cop out and go to law or 
business school right away.

Although I strongly suggest tak-
ing the entrance exams (e.g. LSAT, 
GMAT, GRE) for graduate school 
within a year after you graduate, don’t 
go right away. Even in a good econo-
my, I would tell you to work for a few 
years before going to graduate school. 
These schools will always be there 
for you. Once you go to grad school 
and saddle yourself with even more 
school debt, you will have less flex-
ibility to pursue the things you really 
want to do. Grad school is also a great 
opportunity to transition careers. If 
you use that chip too early, you may 
find it more difficult to transition 
later in your career.

UC’s Financial Sacrifices Are Helpful but Late
By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — California schools 
have been hurting for money for years, and with the state’s 
fiscal crisis deepening seemingly by the minute, the situ-
ation does not look to improve anytime soon. It doesn’t 
take a rocket scientist to understand that the state’s cur-
rent $11.2 billion shortfall has hurt education programs 
ranging from kindergarten all the way up through the 
University of California, leaving many officials scrambling 
to find money just to support essential programs and forc-
ing them to balance services with responsible fiscal rear-
rangements, oftentimes through massive cuts.

Within the state’s flagship 10-campus UC system, the 
problem is as evident as ever, with the university’s govern-
ing body — the Board of Regents — acknowledging that 
student fees will undoubtedly shoot up again next year 
while enrollment figures will drop systemwide in response 
to ever-shrinking state funding. 

Although they opposed raising fees for next year at 
their November meeting, the regents readily admitted the 
move was largely symbolic, reasoning that there was virtu-
ally no way the university could sustain its current services 
without the fee increases because the Legislature would 
be unable to honor the full amount of the state funding 
increase — $755 million — requested by the university for 
the next fiscal year.

With the university in penny-pinching mode and Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger announcing a $65.5 million mid-
year cut to the UC system, campuses have already begun 
feeling the crunch, and UC officials have not been 
silent about the extremely negative impacts the 
funding shortfall will bring to the university. At 
UCSD, for example, the world-renowned Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography is facing an uphill 
battle to maintain its operations, with Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox describing the situation to the 
regents as “precarious.” Other UC campuses 
face similar dilemmas, with no immediate 
relief in sight.

To cope with the fiscal crisis, the UC 
Office of the President has announced that 
it has undertaken massive streamlining mea-
sures meant to consolidate programs, down-
size staff and ultimately save money. To date, 
the office estimates that is has reduced its 
operating budget by a cool $60.4 million — a 21 
percent savings over the prior year — with UC 
President Mark G. Yudof and others praising the 

downsizing for helping the university maintain services 
during such a difficult financial time.

“This is a significant achievement made possible 
by the dedication and hard work of the staff at the 
Office of the President,” Executive Vice President of 
Business Operations Katie Lapp said in a statement. 
“Many participated in helping to design new consoli-
dated units, and many more have shouldered additional 
responsibilities as the workforce has been reduced. It 
has been a painful and difficult time, yet the staff 
has continued to fulfill the mission of the univer-
sity. This must be acknowledged.”

While it’s true that the consolidation has saved 
UCOP millions, the sad reality is that it took an 
extreme financial crisis for the university to realize 
that its management needed restructuring, when 
in reality good old-fashioned smart backroom 
bookkeeping could have been just as effective.

Take, for example, the Continuing Education 
of the Bar Program, which provides services 
for UC-trained lawyers and was previously 
housed within UCOP before being funneled 
out of the central office to specific cam-
puses. According to UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz, CEBP and other non-campus-
specific programs that were moved away 
from the office were responsible for 
nearly half of UCOP’s savings. If this

MONDAY, JANUARY 5, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

University administrators, 
please resolve to not impede the 
A.S. Council’s new mission in for-
mer-Vice-Chancellor-of-Student-
Affairs-Joseph-Watson-like fash-
ion. Obviously this council needs 
all the help it can get, so it might be 
nice to consider actually working 
hand-in-hand with Triton leaders, 
to make life more cheery for the 
campus’ most important constitu-
ency — its students. 

While your 2008 efforts were 
noteworthy (props specifically to 
new VC of  Student Affairs Penny Rue 
for at least adjusting her new office’s 
dreary status quo and University 
Events Office Director Martin 
Wollensen for all his hard work on 
the Loft and even Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox for giving last year’s No 
on 8 rally the attention it deserved) 
you can do even more to stop hin-
dering campus quality in 2009. 

This can mainly be accomplished 
by demanding that satellite offices 
lighten up. Put an end to outrageous 
space rental charges so that the A.S. 
Council can put on events without 
spending half its budget on renting 
our own gym. Remind those over-
zealous Residential Security Officers 
that students are innocent until 
proven guilty. Conduct a massive 
overhaul of Student Health Services 
so we can get some help this flu sea-

son. And if nothing else, please do 
something about the campus meter 
maids and ticket appeal process — it 
shouldn’t take an epic two-month 
battle to overturn a parking ticket 
that was issued while the recipient 
had a permit in the first place.

Student organizations, spe-
cifically the Greek system, please 
resolve to go green in 2009. Random 
as it seems, this should be an easy 
goal for you, since so many of UCSD’s 
orgs are service oriented anyway. Yet 
somehow despite all this high-mind-
ed hoopla, the campus is still littered 
with the daily frenzy of flyers and 
periodic rush-week posters. 

Now I’m normally not one to get 
all save-the-trees on people, but this 
really is getting ridiculous. Not only 
are you littering Library Walk and 
consequently making a huge hassle 
for whatever custodian is charged 
with cleaning up after you that day, 
you’re also failing to attract people to 
your events. The flyer thing is futile, 
so why not copy the success of those 
ever-controversial Library Walk 
evangelicals? They come armed with 
only a kooky sign and a booming 
voice but are always surrounded by 
interested students. Or just go digi-
tal and use Facebook — you’ll gain 
interest by blending in with the par-
ties we actually want to attend, and 
the rejection won’t seem so personal 
when people choose to ignore.

is the case, why were they there to 
begin with? Apparently, not even the 
university knows.

“[CEBP] really does not have any-
thing to do with the core functions 
of the president’s office as the central 
administrative office,” Schwartz said. 
“That doesn’t need to be here and can 
be located elsewhere.”

Additional funds were also saved 
by restricting executive travel, decreas-
ing consulting expenses and con-
solidating and reorganizing UCOP’s 
central departments. More than 150 
employees also took part in a voluntary 
buyout program that allowed them to 
leave their UCOP positions with hefty 

severance packages. 
But again, just like any other orga-

nization facing budget woes, why didn’t 
the university simply pull the plug on 
nonessential positions when it smelled 
fiscal trouble to begin with rather than 
opting to pay large sums to employ-
ees in return for leaving? The regents 
don’t hesitate on raising student fees 
every year, so the university shouldn’t 
be reluctant to lay off UC person-
nel when the positions can be readily 
consolidated and money can be saved, 
especially during a financial crisis that 
threatens to keep eligible students from 
enrolling next year.

While the university is praising 
itself for allegedly saving money, don’t 

let UCOP’s reorganization fool you 
into thinking the university spends its 
money wisely. It’s just another example 
of the university reacting to budget-
ary restrictions instead of acting to 
prevent them from the beginning. If 
the university is serious about effec-
tive management, it should not limit 
financial restructuring to periods of 
fiscal crisis and instead focus on effi-
cient operations at all times, because 
if the university can’t even manage the 
money it already has, it has no business 
leaving students out on the curb while 
whining to Sacramento for more.

W hile most students take a lab class or shadow a business professional to decide what career they would like to pursue, Revelle College sophomore 
Jeanette Rosas opts for a more direct approach. As part of her 
Education Studies (EDS) minor, she spends four hours twice 
a week at Porter Elementary School to gain an in-depth look 
at teaching.

Serving 106 undergraduate students, the EDS department 
offers three minors — mathematics education, science educa-
tion and general education studies — to students interested in 
a career in education. 

What makes the minors unique are their practicum require-
ment, in which students must spend at least one quarter work-
ing at a local preschool, elementary or high school to observe, 
tutor or mentor students.

“[The practicum] gives them firsthand experience,” EDS 
Assistant Student Affairs Officer Melissa Wolf said. “There’s 
no better way to teach them than to have a student go to a 
classroom and see what it’s all about. There’s only so much 
you can learn from a lecture classroom and to have that appli-
cability.”

The practicum is a collaboration between EDS and Partners 
at Learning program, which sets up relationships between 20 
different, underrepresented and underserved schools within 
the San Diego Unified School District from Mira Mesa to 
Oceanside to National City. Open to students of all majors, 
P.A.L. assigns seach participant to a specific teacher.

 “We base [school assignation] on several factors: where 
they live, what their majors and minors are, what languages 
they speak,” EDS professor Caren Holtzman said. “We also put 

them in groups so that they can work out a carpool. Whether 
they tutor or mentor depends on what co-required course they 
are taking.”

In order to receive their grade of pass/no pass, students 
must spend four to six hours a week at their assigned school. 
However, they are given freedom to choose when they work.

“They need to work out a schedule with their host teacher,” 
Holtzman said. “We tell them to set up a consistent schedule 
because students and teachers really start to depend on them. 
Some teachers will even set up activities for the student to 
work with the kids; they may be in charge of a math or science

D uring peak hours, students sometimes begin hunting for a parking spot as much as a full hour before sched-
uled classes — spiraling up and down the 
Gilman or Pangea Parking Structures, driv-
ing from lot to lot around campus loop and 
shamelessly stalking students who give the 
slightest indication that they may be leav-
ing for the day. While many UCSD com-
muters accept this fate, slumped behind 
their wheels until they find a coveted on-
campus parking space, more than half of 
campus commuters are now looking to 
alternative forms of transportation as their 
primary means of getting to UCSD.

According to a survey conducted last 
Winter Quarter by the Department of 
Transportation and Parking Services, 
UCSD reached a record high in public 
transportation with over 50 percent of 
student, staff and faculty commuters using 
alternative programs offered by T&PS. 
A c c o r d i n g 
to T&PS 
D i r e c t o r 
B r i a n 

d’Autremont, the university has gone from 
66 percent single-occupancy commuting in 
2001 to 49 percent in 2008. He attributes 
this shift to the cost-effective array of alter-
native transportation now available.

“The university, for a very long time, 
has tried to get people here and try to save 
them money if they can, and the way we do 
that is having a huge menu of different pro-
grams so that people can pick what works 
for them,” d’Autremont said. 

These alternative methods now extend 
beyond the widely used campus shuttles 
and the free MTS routes. Pedal Club, car-

pools, vanpools 

and daily rental Zip Cars contribute to the 
growing number of commuter solutions at 
UCSD. 

While Pedal Club requires a commuter’s 
commitment to bike to school and register 
a bicycle for $6, cyclists in the club receive 
an Occasional Use parking permit good 
for any 10 days of one quarter. Also, Pedal 
Club members may receive up to three 
rides home in times of emergency through 
the Guaranteed Ride Home program.

Carpool and vanpool users receive 
many of the same benefits as 

Pedal Club members including Occasional 
Use parking permits and access to GRH 
services. As an added incentive, carpoolers 
can park in a number of prime designated 
spots throughout campus. T&PS facilitates 
the search for same-routed commuters 
through an online ride-matching service.

For alternative commuters who find 
themselves without a car on campus when 
they need one, Zip Car rentals are available 
through T&PS. Zip Cars are rentable for $9 
per hour or $66 per day; these fees include 
gas and insurance. A $35 annual member-
ship fee is also required of students, staff 
and faculty.

activity.”
Even though Rosas was wary 

about the 20 minute drive from 
UCSD to Porter Elementary in San 
Diego, she found the practicum 
experience very rewarding, and 
throughout the quarter she was able 
to run several activities with her 
second-grade class.

“I read a story aloud to the class 
and ran a math game activity, and 
I’m writing a bilingual children’s 
book as part of my EDS final,” 
Rosas said. “Luckily, [the students] 
have all enjoyed the activities. It’s 
great because you get that experi-
ence of coming up with a lesson 
plan or activity that is your own. 
You have to think about the stu-
dents, how they will react, and how 
to get them involved. It’s your activ-
ity, and you’re going to run it and 
hope it succeeds.”

The practicum also provides stu-
dents with a chance to interact one-
on-one with students and make a 
great impact on their lives, accord-
ing to Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Chelsea Maxwell. She took 
the practicum for three quarters: 
once as a social studies tutor for 
high school students and twice as 
an elementary school mentor.

 “I just couldn’t get myself to 
stop mentoring them [after only one 
quarter],” Maxwell said of the fifth 
graders she worked with. “I wanted 
to continue with them and ease the 
transition from middle school to 
high school. I just couldn’t break off 
that relationship so quickly.”

Rosas agrees that P.A.L. and EDS 
students serve as great role models 
to the students they are assisting, 
especially since these students are 
part of the underserved and low-
income community.

“These kids have grown up with-
out a role model that’s gone to 
college,” Rosas said. “It gives these 
students an idea. A lot of times, 

college isn’t an option because of 
lack of resources or lack of money. 
For these kids to see that it is pos-
sible, it makes a difference. It’s great 
that we’re able to show them that 
what we are now, they can be too 
some day.”

EDS and P.A.L. students are a 
great resource to the teachers as 
well. Having college students in the 
classroom on a consistent basis has 
enabled Florence Elementary kin-
dergarten teacher and EDS graduate 
Elizabeth Frausto a chance to talk to 
her students about college and what 
they can do in the future. 

“I’ll have the EDS students lead 
small group activities to support 
those of my students who are strug-
gling, or enrich the thinking of 
others,” Frausto said in an e-mail. 
“Often, they’ll assist me in super-
vising and questioning students to 
deepen their understanding. EDS 
students are a terrific way for me to 
provide one-on-one interventions 
for my most needy students. They 
are an invaluable resource to make 
sure all my students receive per-
sonal attention.”

After students complete the 
EDS minor, they have the option 
to apply for the EDS Master of 
Education Degree and Credential 
program, either to become a sin-
gle-subject high school teacher or 
multiple-subject elementary school 
teacher.

“If a UCSD student completes 
the EDS minor, they’re finishing off 
the first year of our credential pro-
gram, or the foundational course-
work,” Wolf said. “So, they stay at 
UCSD for an extra 10 to 11 months 
after they graduate and are then 
certified as a California teacher.”

However, not all EDS minor stu-
dents choose to go to the gradu-
ate program because of its limited 
options. The EDS graduate program 
only offers credentials for single-
subject teachers in biology, chem-
istry, geosciences, physics, English 
and mathematics.

program or EDS minor, visit www.
eds.ucsd.edu.

Readers can contact Jasmine Ta at 
jata@ucsd.edu.

Each of these options attempts 
to combat three major hurdles fac-
ing both commuters and the univer-
sity, which include commute costs, 
sustainability and parking capacity 
according to Curt Lutz, Commute 
Solutions and Marketing Manager. 

“Commute costs are the first 
place many people must look to 
reduce their monthly expenditures,” 
Lutz said in an e-mail. “The costs of 
purchasing, insuring, maintaining, 
fueling and parking a private vehi-
cle can be a large part of anyone’s 
monthly budget.” 

Because these alternative solu-
tions take many single-occupancy 
commuters off the road, a sense 
of environmental accountability is 
also championed by those involved 
in alternative transportation on 
campus.

“The other major portion of 
what we’re trying to do here is we’re 
trying to put less pollution into the 
air,” d’Autremont said. “In the last 
three years, we put around 2,000 
people into buses and other [types 
of] public transportation that used 
to be in single-occupancy cars. That 
saves around 500 tons of pollu-
tion.”

Along with cost and sustain-
ability, alternative transportation 
stands to alleviate long-term park-
ing capacity issues. According to a 
report published by Sam Corbett, 
assistant director of T&PS, between 
2001 and 2008 campus popula-
tion increased by nearly 26 per-
cent while parking occupancy only 
increased from 11,893 to 12,304 
occupied parking spaces on average 
over the same period — an increase 
of 4.1 percent.

“As the campus grows over time, 
ground lot parking areas are often 
the site for new campus structures, 
as those less expensive surface lots 

disappear, the decision to build 
multilevel parking structures is a 
huge financial commitment with 
costs running at many thousands 
of dollars per space,” Lutz said. 
“Ultimately the cost for this parking 
capacity falls on the end user.” 

The All Campus Commuter 
Board, a student-run organization 
aimed at voicing the concerns of 
student commuters, also advocates 
the use of alternative transportation 
despite being largely left out of the 
policy-making process. 

The board has participated 
in transportation issues in the 
past, opposing the construction 
of a new parking structure that 
would raise student parking fees 
during last year’s Transportation 
Policy Committee’s annual meet-
ing. However, they were not asked 
to participate in the most recent 
Transit Subsidy Survey concern-
ing the allocation of transportation 
funds. According to d’Autremont, 
the survey still included student 
input. 

ACCB Director of Programming 
and Earl Warren College senior Kari 
McNickle said the board is looking 
forward to the survey results so it 
can begin working on future pro-
grams. 

ACCB members also attempt 
to address the concerns of driving 
commuters by discussing possible 
solutions to the 80 percent occu-
pancy rate of the campus’ approxi-
mately 16,000 total parking spaces. 
These suggestions include the real-
location of parking spaces to create 
more “S” spaces out of unused “A” 
spaces or the possibility of restrict-
ing freshman parking on campus. 
The ACCB recognizes that despite 
the monetary or environmental 
advantages of alternative transpor-

tation, some students continue to 
favor the convenience involved in 
driving to campus.

Earl Warren senior Lindsay 
Sheridan, a resident of the UTC area, 
opted to purchase a parking permit 
this Fall Quarter and drove to school 
for early morning and evening excur-
sions to campus rather than taking a 
school shuttle or public bus.

“I only drove when I had 8 a.m. 
classes,” Sheridan said in an e-mail. 
“The other time it is beneficial is if 
I have classes after 4:30 p.m. In that 
case, I really enjoy having a permit 
since I can park in A and B spots, 
because I really don’t like taking the 
shuttle home at night.” 

Lutz implores commuters to re-
examine their notions of conve-
nience and weigh their commuting 
options carefully.

“There is a choice involved to 
change the way one commutes and 
there are benefits to each choice, 
including how you look at flexibility,” 
he said.

The success of T&PS’s alterna-
tive transportation programs in 
helping to change the habits of over 
50 percent of campus commuters 
is not limited to UCSD. Many uni-
versities look to T&PS’s example to 
ease parking congestion and reduce 
their own carbon footprint.  

“UCSD is pretty much a bench-
mark for other universities,” 
d’Autremont said. “I get calls almost 
every week about how we’re doing 
things. [Universities] from all over 
the nation like Virginia, Penn, the 
University of Miami, University of 
Texas, Austin. There are a lot of 
people trying to learn.”

down the court, assisting on Kim’s three that 
put the Tritons ahead by two points with 
just over two minutes left to play. During 
the Tritons’ next offensive possession, Kim 
went to the ground to protect a loose ball and 
appeared to have sustained a slight injury. 
Following a timeout, Kim was replaced by 
freshman guard Kirby Ruiz. Ruiz, playing in 
the biggest moments of his first season as a 
Triton, caught a tipped offensive rebound 
from Poppen and hit a shot clock-beating 
three-pointer to give the Tritons a five-point 
advantage. Following a retaliatory three from 
CSULA, Kim re-entered the game and scored 
a layup on the other end. 

The two teams then traded free throws 
before another three-pointer from Chris Fields 
closed the gap to one point. Kim gave the 
Tritons some breathing room, making 1-of-2 
from the charity stripe. Fields then stepped 
to the line for the Golden Eagles and missed 
both free-throw opportunities. Appropriately, 
it was the returning Stuckey who grabbed the 
defensive rebound, drew the foul and calmly 
hit both foul shots on the other end to seal the 
victory for UCSD.

“Every night in this league is really, really 
difficult,” Carlson said. “Any time you can 
beat a team with the caliber of Cal State L.A., 
you feel good about it. That was a very good 
win for us. It’s a marathon, not a sprint in this 
league. You’ve got to be tough over a long 
haul. I don’t think we’ve even come close to 
playing our best basketball. I think that’s still 
ahead of us.”

Even though they may not have reached 
their full potential yet, Lawley believes that 
the Tritons gave their full effort in the vic-
tory.

“We wanted it more than them,” he said. 
“We came out there on fire and wanted to 
make a statement to the league, especial-
ly since [CSULA] just beat [CSUDH] on 
Wednesday.”

As a team, the Tritons shot 44.2 percent 
from the field and recorded a 40-24 rebound-
ing advantage. Kim led the way offensively 
with 16 points and added three assists, while 
Poppen recorded his third consecutive dou-
ble-double with 15 points and a game-high 
12 rebounds. Husted scored 11 points with 

a game-high five assists and three rebounds, 
while Stuckey scored 10 points with five 
rebounds.

“It felt good to be back,” Stuckey said 
of his return performance, which included 
going 3-for-4 from the field and 4-for-4 from 
the line. “I hope to be a little bit more of a 
scoring threat inside. All of our big guys can 
score, but I hope to be able to step out a little 
bit and spread the defense with 15-foot, 17-
foot jumpers and hopefully, be a leader for 
all these guys. We’ve got a lot of young guys 
and I’ve got to try to be a good role model 
for them.”

Over the winter break, the Tritons cruised 
to two victories at the CCAA-PacWest 
Shootout in Las Vegas. UCSD trounced the 
Academy of Art University, 62-40, as Poppen 
scored 13 points with 11 rebounds and the 
Triton defense held Academy of Art to just 13 
field goals and 25.5 percent shooting from the 
field. Defense again led the way in a 78-60 win 
over Grand Canyon, as the Tritons held the 
Antelopes below 30 percent shooting from the 
field in the second half to turn a close contest 
into an easy victory. 

“We know how to win,” Lawley said. He 
currently leads the team in scoring with 13.2 
points per game. “When we played Grand 
Canyon, the guys gave it their all. It showed us 
that we’re a capable team.”

All five starters scored in double figures, 
led by Husted’s season-high 19 points, 14 
from Kim and Poppen, 13 from Lawley and 10 
from Maulhardt. Maulhardt and Poppen also 
grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds each, nearly 
matching the 27 rebounds Grand Canyon 
University grabbed as a team.

“I thought we showed a lot of toughness, 
especially against a very good Grand Canyon 
team,” Carlson said. “We were just a little 
tougher; we took care of the ball, got good 
shots, executed and did the things we needed 
to do to be successful.”

The Tritons return to action next weekend 
with their first road conference contests of the 
year. UCSD faces Cal State San Bernardino on 
Friday and Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday, with 
both games scheduled for 7:30 p.m. tip-offs.

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, JANUARY 5, 2009

By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Taking 
advantage of their longest homestand 
of the season, the Tritons won six of 
their seven games at home between 
Dec. 6 and Jan. 3 to improve their 
overall record to 11-2.

After posting victories in their 
first conference games this season 
against Humboldt State University 
and Sonoma State University on Dec. 
5 and Dec. 6 respectively, UCSD 
suffered a 75-65 loss to St. Mary’s 
on Dec. 19. Since then the Tritons 
have been on a tear, defeating No. 
21 Drury University 86-61 on Dec. 
20 and San Diego Christian College 
83-47 on Dec. 30. UCSD finished 
its homestand with conference wins 
against Cal State Los Angeles and Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Jan. 2 and 
Jan. 3 respectively.

UCSD’s latest victory was made 
in comeback fashion as CSUDH 
held the Triton offense in check dur-
ing the first half. The Toros shut 
out leading scorer senior forward 
Michelle Osier in the opening peri-
od and held UCSD’s second-leading 
scorer senior center Alexis Gaskin to 
just two points. 

“[CSUDH] definitely had our best 
players targeted,” sophomore for-
ward Molly McIntyre said. “They had 
trouble getting their offense going 
and were shut out in the first half.”

Despite the struggles of the team’s 
sharp shooters, UCSD remained 
close in the game and ended the half 
trailing by only three points largely 
due to its defense, which held the 

Toros to 28.9 percent shooting. 
Junior forward Erin Noonan gave 

the Tritons some life in the second 
half, starting off the period with a 
three-pointer that tied the game at 
28. UCSD took a 30-28 lead off a 
layup from Gaskin with 17:46 left 
and never relinquished the advan-
tage. Noonan led all scorers in the 
game with 17 points and junior guard 
Annette Ilg added 14.

Of their four victories over win-
ter break, UCSD’s win over Drury 
University may have been the most 
impressive. Not only did the Tritons 
pull off the upset, the 25-point Drury 
loss was the worst defeat in the pro-
gram’s history. 

“Part of it was because we lost the 
game the previous night,” McIntyre 
said. “We had the mentality that we 
couldn’t let a team do that to us again 

on our home court. We came out 
with incredible focus and everyone 
executed well in every area.”

The Tritons jumped out to a 15-
5 lead, with offensive contributions 
from starters Gaskin, Noonan, Osier 
and junior guard Leilani Martin. 
Nursing a commanding lead early, 
the Tritons were able to tap into their 
bench and allow other players to step 
up. Freshman guard Chelsea Carlisle 
responded to the challenge, convert-
ing on her first attempt of the game 
with a three-pointer that put UCSD 
up 18-7 with 14:03 left in the half. 

Carlisle added five more points 
in the opening period as the Tritons 
never let up and built a 41-27 lead at 
halftime. 

What on paper should have been 
a close game ended as a blowout 
thanks to the UCSD bench, which 
scored 20 points in the second half. 
Carlisle led the bench with  17 points 
in her second collegiate game. Gaskin 
scored 22 points and recorded nine 
rebounds and Osier netted 19 points 
and 13 rebounds to lead the Tritons. 

UCSD’s wins over CSUDH and 
CSULA kept its conference record 
perfect at 4-0. The Tritons will hit the 
road against Cal State San Bernardino 
and Cal Poly Pomona as part of 18 
straight conference games that they 
have just started.

“We want to go undefeated in 
conference,” Carlisle said. “The game 
plan, like in our games at home, starts 
defensively, playing together. If we do 
that, we’re a hard team to beat.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons started 2009 with a split 
against California Collegiate 
Athletic Association opponents over 
the weekend, defeating Cal State 
Los Angeles on Jan. 2 by a 68-64 
final score, before falling to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, 63-51, on 
Jan. 3. The victory over CSULA 
was the fifth-straight win for the 
Tritons, including two over winter 
break against the Academy of Art 
University and Grand Canyon as 
part of the CCAA-PacWest Shootout 
in Las Vegas. UCSD’s record now 
stands at 6-4 overall and 3-1 in the 
CCAA.

While struggling offensively, the 
Tritons stayed close to CSUDH by 
playing tough defense, limiting the 
Toros to only seven first-half field 
goals and out-rebounding the squad 
19-14 before the half. Junior guard 
Jordan Lawley gave the Tritons their 
largest lead of the first period just 
over five and a half minutes into the 
game with a three-pointer off a pass 
from sophomore guard Casey Ryan, 
putting UCSD up 10-4. With both 
teams going scoreless for over three 
minutes from the 11:46 mark and 
then over two minutes from 7:51, 
the Tritons were able to maintain a 
slim advantage for much of the half. 
The Toros captured their first lead 
of the game with 4:50 left follow-
ing a layup. UCSD would respond 
with a jumper from freshman center 
Christian Hatch, his fourth field 
goal of the half, and a three-pointer 

from junior guard Tyler Acevedo.
“Christian Hatch played pretty 

well,” head coach Chris Carlson 
said. “I think any time you’re on the 
plus-side in rebounding, it’s a posi-
tive. I still think we could have done 
a better job there though.”

Toro player Rodney Yearby scored 
the last four points of the half with 
a layup and two free throws, leaving 
the Tritons down 20-19 at the break. 
UCSD recaptured the lead quickly 
in the second half, with a layup by 
senior forward Shane Poppen off 
an assist from senior center A.J. 
Maulhardt and a three-pointer by 
senior guard Kelvin Kim to give the 
Tritons a 24-22 advantage. CSUDH 
responded with a triple of its own to 
regain the lead. While the Tritons 
again maintained their rebounding 
edge, the team would fall behind 
by double-digits with 13:30 left to 
play.

Climbing to within five points 
down the stretch, UCSD’s season-
high 18 turnovers, compared to only 
eight total turnovers and three in the 
second half for CSUDH, prevented 
the Tritons from continuing their 
first winning streak of the season. 
Despite eight points from Kim in 
the final 1:21 of the game, the Toros 
held the Tritons to their lowest 
scoring output against a Division-II 
opponent this season.

“They’re a great team and they 
came out with a lot of intensity,” 
Lawley said. “We just kind of whim-
pered down and didn’t really step 
up to their level and match their 
intensity. We’re going to be working 
a lot on our press and press situa-
tions. We felt like we kind of gave 
into their pressure.”

Kim’s 14 points were a game-
high, as he added three assists, three 
rebounds and a block in a game-
high 38 minutes of play. Lawley 
scored 11 points with four rebounds 
in the game, going 2-for-3 from a 

three-point range. Poppen grabbed 
a game-high seven rebounds, while 
Hatch finished with nine points and 
four rebounds in 17 minutes off the 
bench.

The Tritons and Golden Eagles of 
Cal State Los Angeles were locked in 
a close battle throughout the entire 
matchup Friday night. After CSULA 
opened up to a six-point advan-
tage in the opening period, UCSD 
responded with a 10-3 run capped 
off by a layup and two free throws 
from returning redshirt senior for-
ward Brett Stuckey. Stuckey, hav-
ing missed all of last season and 
the start of this year due to injury, 
checked in with 11:37 to play. Less 
than 10 seconds later, the senior 

used a reverse layup off an assist 
from senior guard Alan Husted to 
score his first collegiate basket in 
over a year.

“There were a lot of nerves pre-
game,” Stuckey said. “Once I started 
playing and made that first basket, I 
had a lot of support from the team 
— it was all good.”

Two three-pointers from Kim, 
one from Husted, and a layup from 
Ryan helped the Tritons extend to 
a nine-point advantage, their larg-
est of the half, with 5:21 left to 
play. Limiting the Golden Eagles to 
25 percent field-goal shooting and 
grabbing 27 rebounds compared to 
only eight for CSULA, the Tritons 
went into the break leading 29-21.

In the second half, it was the 
opposition that started quickly, as 
CSULA scored eight of the first 
10 points to tie the game at 31. 
Following two Poppen free throws, 
CSULA took the lead and extended 
to a three-point advantage following 
a three-pointer and jumper from 
Golden Eagles forward Chris Fields. 
The lead changed four more times 
during the second half, as neither 
squad was able to extend to more 
than a five-point advantage.

With 3:21 remaining, Husted hit 
a three-pointer for the Tritons off 
of a Kim assist. Husted returned 
the favor during UCSD’s next drive

While defense remains the Tritons’ main strength, UCSD also spread the ball around well on offense 
in their five games over winter break, which featured different leading scorers in each game.

Following a loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills, the Tritons conference record stands at 3-1 with the majority of their CCAA still left to play. UCSD will 
travel to face Cal State San Bernardino and its 3-1 conference record as well as Cal Poly Pomona, currently 2-2 in conference play, later this week.
