Strike in Son Ysidro 
Chancellor William McGill announced his resignation a year 

ago last January. Appointment of a search committee was 
made in April. 1970. and in July a slate of eight candidates was 
sent to UC President Hitch. 

Indications are that after checking into one or more of these 
Hitch decided that Grobstein was most suitable. However. a 
group of UCSD faculty had by this time convinced several 
conservative Regents that Grobstein was not a good choice. 
and that a liberal establishment on the search committee had 
packed the slate of caf\didates so as to make Grobstein the only 
real possibility. 

North County Organization to Aid Farmworkers 

Thus through July. August. and September. most Regents 
were willing to wait and see on the Grobstein candidacy. 
because they saw no reason to appoint Grobstein over the 
conservative opposition. 

There are several indications that many Regent. 
particularly John Canaday and William French Smith. were 
worried about the "pack charge." One businessman told the 
TIMES specifically. "Smith told me in conversation that he 
was personally well disposed toward Grobstein. but that he 
was concerned that the Search Committee had not done its job 
as well as it might have." 

The TIMES has learned the names of 'ix men who were on 
the original slate. Some of them are men who would verv 
clearly not have a erious chance of securing a majority 
approval IrOIl) the Regents under any circumstances. One of 
the men. lor example. was once fired by the Regents for 
reI uSing to take the loyalty oath. 

The TIMES ha' no' direct information to explain why 'uch 
men might have been included . But one explanation seem 

lalrl~' obvious : the Search ommitlee contain ' many 
' p clahz d interests. including. lor th lirst time. three 
student· . The majority might have been willing to accept the 
names of obviousl~' "unlikel~' " candidates Imply because they 
knew 'uch men would have no chance. but their inclu'ion on 

~he ' late would make the inner working ' of the committee 
It 'elt ·moother.

Raoul Contreras and 
Marta Puente 

Responding to a call by Robert 
Greaves, UFWOC boycott organizer in 
San Diego, North County students, 
teachers, and other community 
residents formally organized last week 
to help support striking farm workers in 
San Ysidro. Meeting in the Del Mar 
home of UCSD students Sheila Merrill 
and Marta Puente, the North County 
Friends of the Farmworkers made plans 
for a number of food and fund raising 
projects. 

Providing much of the initiative at the 
meeting was Anne Brown, San Dieguito 
High School teacher and organizer of 
last month's boycott of Big Bear market 
in Del Mar. At this meeting it wa 
decided that the group would 
concentrate its present efforts on 
helping the farmworkers strike at th 
Egger-Ghio Ranch in San Ysidro. 

The labor dispute at the Egger-Ghio 
Ranch began in late March when 12 
workers were fired for reportedly 
" fooling around in the fields and not 
doing their work." However, the 
workers contend that they were fired 
because of their a sociation with 
UFWOC representative and becau 
they had been caught wearing UFWOC 
buttons in the fields. After the original 
12 were fired, the vast majority of field 
workers at the Egger-Ghio Ranch 
walked off the fields in protest, 
initiating the strike. 

North County Friends of the 
Farmworkers say further developments 

in San Ysidro include a demand for a 
union contract by the striking 
farm workers. UFWOC representatives 
had originally come into the area 
because farm workers in the San Diego 
area have never had any union 
representation. As a result of the strike, 
the Human Resources Development for 
the State of California has certified that 
there is a legitimate labor dispute 
between the workers and the Egger 
Ghio Ranch. The significance of this is 
that the grower can not hire green card 
workers from Mexico to break the 
strike. The workers contend that the 
growers have been doing this 
consistently since the strike began. 

A later development in the dispute 
was that on April 19 the San Diego 
Superior Court decided again t the 
farm workers, holding that the original 
12 workers were ju tifiably fired for not 
working. However, the court also ruled 
that the workers had the right to 
organize, and that the growers must 
cea their attempts to prohibit 
organizing activities. 

On May 1 Cesar Chavez, leader of the 
farm workers organization m vement 
which began in Delano, California, came 
to San Y idro and pledged his 
wholehearted support for th strike. 
While stre ing the need for non-
violence, he called for "unity and 
courage in the truggle lor right ." 

North County Friend of the 
Farmworker sav the San Ysidro 
strikers, having been out of work for 
over two months, are now experiencing 

shortages of food and medical care. 
According to Robert Greaves the 
farmworkers experience at least "one 
medical emergency per day." A number 
of striking farmworkers have been 
evicted from their homes, and some 
families have been forced to break up. 

Food Sbortages Entailed 

In order to alleviate the food shortage, 
the first major project by the NCFF will 
be a food drive this Saturday centered in 
the Del Mar area. A meeting to go over 
final preparations for this food drive 
will be held this afternoon at th home of 
Ann Brown (1843 Ocean Front in Del 
Mar ). NCFF repre ntatives say they 
are seeking more student and 

comm~nity people a volunteer to help 
collect canned and nonperi hable good . 

Other plans by the CFF include a 
rummage sale in the near future for 
rai ing ffio>ney for the farm worker . 
Good are now being solicited for thi 
sale and mly be donated by contacting 

FF in DJ Mar (755-1012). The book 
sale hich will continu in Revell 
Plaza thi w k are also for lhi'

The Developing Wastelands 
Matt Hinlon 

Pholography Edilor 

It all starts so innocently. We' ve got lots of 
people in California, and they need places to 
live. So the Developer says, " Stand ,back! " He 
says, " Step aside there, gonna build you all 
houses ! Bu ild them for your friends, too!" And 
he does. The innocence goes no further ; the 
Developer says now, " On ly got so much land, 
got lots of people. Gotta bu ild dense !" And he 
does. Best way to bu ild dense is to build on the 
flat, and if all the Developer's got is a hill he has 
to flatten it a little. Put in some terraces . Strip 
the mountain down to bare earth and . 
stairstepped square lots. Says the Developer, 

"Sure, if was pretty once, but listen to the 
people! They say, 'Build us homes,' and I do." 
Give the people what they want - a mandate 
excuses everything. "Yeah, sorry about the 
trees. But hell, wait twenty years for the 
landscaping to get going and it'll look fine." 

What is going on here? Why do we stand aside 
when the Developer says to, and watch his land-
breakers and mountain-crackers deflower the 
land? How many of you can remember what 
Mount Soledad looked like fifteen years ago? 
Scripps Grade in 1965? Rose Canyon, Hidden 
Valley last year? You 're all going to scatter 
now, leave the University for a few months of 
different living. You're going to go t1ome, or 
travel a while; doesn' t matter, because 

wherever you go you ' re going to find the raw 
earth scars of the Developer, maybe in your own 
favorite valley . We are the Developer's excuse. 
We ask him to build, 'and then turn him loose on 
our hills. What alternatives there are to this type 
of land use are undefined, largely due to a lack 
of thought and effort. Basically, we must think 
f irst of the land, its form and function, and shape 
our environmental designs to fit . The Developer 
won't develop ' alternatives without being 
pushed ; it would cost him money. We must not 
give him our mandate any longer. Look at the 

. land this summer, wherever you are, and think 
about alternatives. Maybe, when we all come 
back together in the fall, we can pool our ideas 
and get something started.

TRITON TIMES SUPPLEMENT 

$$ REGISTRATION FEES 
The purpose of this supplement is to acquaint 

the students with a little-known but terribly 
important facet of University finance : 
registration fees. The general provisions for 
collection of student fees by the University to 
cover the cost of non-educational expenses are 
contained in the Master Plan for Higher 
Education . Each campus in the system has a 
chancellor's committee, the Advisory 
Committee for University Registrat ion Fees, 
which is apPOinted each year for the purpose of 
submitting a budget regarding the allocation of 
the student fee. 

The rules governing the make-up of this 
Registration Fee Committee are as follows : the 
committee shall have equal representation of 
students and non-students. The chancellor shall 
appoint two co-chairmen, one of whom shall be a 
student member. The colleges shall be 
represented by the provosts and one student 
member each . The voting members are charged 
with the responsibility for promoting the 
interests of the student body as a whole, rather 

than the interests of speCial groups or the 
discharge of administrative responsibility. Two 
graduate students, recommended if possibl e by 
a campus-wide organization, shall also be 
members. The Associated Students shal l be 
represented by the AS president or his delegated 
representative. A faculty representative-at-
large shall be apPOinted by the chancellor. 
Consultants to the committee may include 
var ious members of the administration if they 
are not serving as members. 

This committee is charged to meet in 
February or March of each year for the purpose 
of reviewing the monetary situation up to that 
time and making next year 's recommendations. 
They are guided in th i s task by certain prior it ies 
and limitations. Included in their budget must 
be laboratory costs, debt service, contingency 
reserves, and prov isions regarding ex isting 
programs, salary increases, new program 
proposals and expansion. In addit ion to student-
services programs, recommendations for 
student aid programs may also be made. In 

addition to the above-listed requirements a 
reserve shall be maintained. 

In past years at this campus the committee as 
a whole met and worked on the budget. This 
year a new system was tried. An ad hoc 
committee was formed, led by Dean Murphy 
and Don Br ight. Non-Reg Fee members were 
recruited from the student body, the 
administration, and the faculty to aid Murphy 
and Bright in the make-up of a budget to be 
presented as a whole. This year the task was 
especially difficult because of a deficit carry-
over from the present year's budget, and an 
increase in medical costs associated with 
student health services . The ad-hoc committee 
has just released their recommendations; now 
these recommendations go before the Reg Fee 
Committee for considerat ion. The following is a 
presentation of this year's budget as compared 
with next year's, what the recommended budget 
c~anges are, and what they mean. 

This supplement was researched and wriffen By JeH Fried 
and Frank Phillips

In general, due to an increase in med ical 
costs and a need to make up a deficit from

effectiveness, and any recomm t have regarding procedure 
for next year. We have also department heads whose

Paul Kaufman President Associated Students 

Year Round Review Proposed 
TT : You were a memb 'r of the Ad Hoc Commi ttee. What i~ 
your opinIOn 01 th procedure used thi ' year and what 
improvements do you think would be appropriate '! 

Kaufman said that he thinks thc Rcgistration Fee use 
shoull.! be considered on a year-round basis by a permanent 
commille . He said a committee 'hould constantly review 
programs tunded by registration te .. to detcrmine th ir 
value to students . The AS pr ,.ident 'aid that thc process for 
determi ning funding , hould begin earlier than it did thi s 
yea r 

Student-Administration Clash 
Don Bright Student Co-Chairman Committee Registration Fee 
TT: How do you view the procedure tor determining 
RegIstration Fec allocation ': Wha t improvements do you 
see needed '. 

Bright told the TRITON TI:\<IES that he thinks there were 
severa l things wrong \~ith the Re!!i ·trallon Fee allocation 
procedure this year . Bright said the budget consid ration 
began too late in thc year and staff members who are 
dIrectly allected by fcc allocation were not involved in the 
process. Bright says that persons involved III uSlIlg the funds 
'hould detend th ir needs among themselves and then come 
to thc Ad Hoc Committee with th ir requests. Bright sa id 
.. As I t is now. WE' are Imposing thing ' on the stalf and you 
can ' t do that. You have to come trom the bottom up." 

The co-chairman 01 the fee committee commented that 
there appears to be an IIlcreasll1g difference between the 
priOrities 01 the adminl:<tratlon and the students. Bright said 
that admi ni strators give fir"t priority to student services 
such as the hea lth servIce or career planning services. The 
student member" ot the tee commIttee have given a higher 
prionty to ·tudent-initiated project · such as KSDT and the 
Experimental Th ater. according to Bright. He say- that 
administrators want to provide funding lor student services 
in excess ot what students consider to be the need . 

Student Affairs Budget Cut 
Will Smith Dean of Student Affairs 

TT : How will the proposed budget cuts allect Student 
Analrs ': 

Dean Snlllh rcplied that the proposed budget repre~ented 
$2U-31l.()()11 dollar~ le 's than the 'um that he had hoped to 
recelvc : He sait.l lhat 'ome programs would likely have to 
b' cut back and that. many new proj ects that he had hoped to 
II1l tlate would be eliminated. He sllll has hopes that some 
monIes can be rl'stored to the Student Alfairs budget and 
that ,.om ot the new programs can be instituted. 

EOP Not Affected 
Tony Valencia EOP Administration 

TT: Last year approximately $84 ,000 was appropriated from 
registration fees for EOP administration . Will this year ' s 
decrease to $50,000 affect your program ? 

Mr. V,alencia replied that the cut in registration fee 
support will have no effect on EOP. He said that the 
difference is being made up from other funding sources. 

Less Counseling 
Mort Shaevill Director the Counseling Center 

IT: This year' s proposed Registration Fee budget calls for 
cuts between $5 ,000 and $16,000 in the allocation for 
Counseling and Psychological Services. How would those 
cuts affect counseling at UCSD? 

Shaevitz told the TRITON TIMES that a $5,000 cut in his 
budget could be made up by having people take a month of 
unpaid vacation in the Summer. A large cut would 
necessitate a reduction in service because at least one 
counselor would have to be fired , according to Shaevitz. He 
commented that it would be " unfortunate" if the low budget 
was adopted because it is very difficult for psychologists to 
find employment now. Shaevitz said that each counselor 
here has seen an average of 20 students per week without 
need to be on a waiting list. If it becomes necessary to 
reduce his staff there will be delays for students desiring 
counseling. 

Half Staff at Career Planning 
Dr. Burcbill Director of Career Educational Planning 

IT: Dr. Burchill, the Ad Hoc Committee has made two 
recommendation s concerning funding of Career-
Educational Planning, The majority report recommended 
$26,852, and the minority report recommended $42,935. What 
will be the status of Career-Educational Planning under 
these proposals? 

Dr. Burchill replied that under the majority 
recommendation he would have to cut back to less than one-
half the present staffing , and in addition most members of 
the staff would have to take leaves without pay over the 
summer. Under the minority report he felt that, with the 
summer leaves without pay and perhaps a slight cutback in 
secretarial help, most services could be continued. 

Dr. Burchill stressed the point that Career-Educational 
Planning will be a vital need of the students in the coming 
decade and that a curtailment of the program now would be 
a serious setback. 

No New Programs from Dean 
Tom Hull Dean of Revelle College 

TT: This year there were several cutbacks which will affect 
the colleges directly. Funding for the freshman orientation 
program and residence hall advisor program was cut. What 
will be the effect of these reductions in funding? 

Dean Hull said that the colleges will have to work toward 
a self-sustaining summer orientation program for 
freshmen. He sait:! the cut will probably eliminate the 
possibility of an expansion of innovation in existing 
programs. 

The Revelle College dean said that the cut in funding for 
the residence hall advisor program will result in a decrease 
in benefits to the advisors. Until now residence advisors 
received room a nd board . Wi th the cutbacks they would only 
rece ive room and a small (Hull said maybe only $50 a yearl 
allowance tor food . 

Hull declared that otherwise there will not be serious 
reductions in services by the colleges. He noted , however, 
that probably no new programs will be possible. 

Summation 
The general concensus of the members of the Ad Hoc Committee was that the 

ad hoc com mittee system worked well as far as it went. Most agreed that the 
process should be started earlier to allow for more feedback both from the 
departments and students concerned . Dean Hull felt that the makeup of the Ad 
Hoc Committee shoul d be altered slightly to insure including all three college 
deans, each college's student representative, the student co-chairmen of the 
Registration Fee Committee, the dean of student affairs, and the vice-
chancellor of student affairs_ This year the committee was almost constituted 

---------- -- ----

ncial Aids Office OK 
Lawrence Dreyer Director of Student Financial Aids 

The proposed budget as it stands shows an $18,000 
from last year 's allocation. How does this affect 

opera tional status for next year? 

Dryer replied that two items that his office was 
draft counseling and part of student employment, 
ng to be funded from a different source. This leaves 

s funds at basically the same level as last year 's. 
will not be able to add additional staff members 

would have wished, Dryer said, they will be able to 
the student at an acceptable level. 

eation First Priority 
Dr. Forbes Chairman Physical Education 

What effect will proposed budget cuts have on the 
F ,'cu""glalt: athletic program ? 

Forbes replied that the first effect of any cutbacks 
be the reduction of schedules. There would be fewer 
scheduled for all sports. Another money saving 
would be the re-use of this year's uniforms. In the 

this alone was not enough an intercollegiate sport 
have to be dropped. This action would only be taken 

last resort. 
the event of thi s action being necessary, meetings 
be held with the Chancellor' s Advisory Committee for 
IIJ' rrolllpD'~I" Athletics and with students concerned. In 

nothing will be sacrificed at the expense of 
I athletics; they are the number-one priority. 

Ith Service Charges 
Dr. Allen Director Student Healtb Service 

What changes are planned ror the Student Health 
and how will th.e proposed budget affect these 

and present services? 

. Allen replied that the proposed budget that he had 
, which he considers just adequate for a 

nity of UCSD's size, certain new services would be 
and charges would have to be made for some 
now offered. 

services are keeping a registered nurse on duty 
a day and the employment of a pharmacist. The 
ist is being employed in order to free doctors of the 

them with more time for patient care. The 
of a nurse at all hours will provide 

.. ,u·,",'-",n(O" assistance and remove the necessity of 
EDNA for late-hour medical care. 

which charges would be made include 
drugs, immunizations for non-University-

personal needs (Le. trips to Europe ), a nd special 
written reports for the same reasons. Birth control 

'11 be continued on the same basis as this y ar. All 
serv ices will remain the same. 

len stated that the reasons behind the need to 
these charges was an across-the-board increase in 
of medical services. He e mphasized that the per 

UV'·''' ''JII per student for health serv ices will be less 
than it wa s in 1970-71. 

George Murphy Vice Chancellor Student Affairs 

Criticism Justified-Murphy 
'IT : There has been some criticism of the Registration Fee 
allocation procedure this year. Critics have cited the fact 
that the Ad Hoc Committee did not begin its work until April 
and therefore did not have enough time for determining the 
views of persons outside the Registration Fee Committee. 
How do you view the results of this year 's a llocation 
procedure? 

Murphy told the TRITON TIMES that he feels that 
criticism of this year's late consideration of the 
Registration Fee budget is justified. He said that he hoped 
that consideration of the next budget could begin in January 
instead of April , as it was this year. Murphy commented 
that the procedure itseU is "very good." Citing the 
effectiveness of the allocation procedure, Murphy noted 
that although more than $1.8 million was involved, 
disagreement within the Ad Hoc Committee was narrowed 
to the proposed use of only $20,000. Commenting on how the 
budget cuts will a ffect his office , Murphy said he will no 
longer be able to employ a (ulltime receptionist. 

Hull Wants Earlier Meetings 
Tom Hull Dean of Revelle College 

TT: What is your opinion of the procedure for determining 
registration fee allocation a nd what improvements do you 
think should be made in that procedure? 

Dean Hull said that he feel s the determination of fee 
allocation should have begun earlier than it did . This year 
the Ad Hoc Committee began meeting in March; Hull 
suggested the procedure should have begun in December so 
that greater consideration could have been given to the use 
of funds. 

Hull said that he approves of having an ad hoc committee 
make recommendations to the full committee . He 
suggested that the ad hoc committee should consist of at 
least the three college deans, the colleges' student 
representatives to the Registration Fee Committee, the AS 
president, and the student co-chairman of the Registration 
Fee Committee, as well as the dean of student affairs and 
the vice-chancellor of student affairs . This year there was 
no Third College student representative attending the 
committee meeting, a nd Hull said that wa s unfortunate. 

Less for Publications 
Craig Starr Chairman Communications Board 

IT: The proposed registration fee support of the 
Communications Board for next year is approximately 
$15,500. This is a reduction of about $4,000 from last year. 
What effect will this have on the campus media ? 

Starr told the TRITON TIMES that if the proposed budget 
is adopted, support of subsidiary publications such as 
DIMENSION, THIRD WORLD, and CRAZY TIME' will 
have to be curtailed. Starr said that the present levels of 
support for the TRITON TIMES and radio station KSDT will 
be maintained with an increase to KSDT for improvement 
of programming for FM convcf'ion. 

along these lines with the exception of a student representat ive from Third 
College . 

The department heads that were contacted all answered similarly . They sa id 
tha t they had submitted budgets that had been pared to the bone. They further 
said that any cuts from their proposals would mean either a curtailment in 
ser vices or paycuts for members of their staffs. 

Over all it appears that the departments willbe able to live with the budgets as 
presented by the Ad Hoc Committee_ It appears that this year represents a 
temporary setback in the growth of most programs.Withoutfurther increases in 
medica l costs, and if a deficit is not incurred again this year, normal growth 
should again be possible next year ,

Chancellor Search •.. 
tCedllled freDa pile 1) 

Thus in :\Iarch, ever~·tbing was back to "start. " And at this 
point. campaigns for Grobstein and Hardin Jones. an extreme 
conservative from \.,'C Berkeley. grew up in the San Diego 
area . 

These movements tended to oflset each other. though the 
Grobstein one seemed the more substantial. Reagan. one man 
complained. doesn't know his Who's Who of the San Diego 
establishment. Since both campaigns contained the same 
number of letters. then. Reagan wouldn 't act either way. 
I There is also considerable evidence to suggest that Jones 
supporters exaggerated the strength of their movement 
con iderabl\,. I 

Conservative Regents. meanwhile. threatened to sabotage 
Presidential budget policies if Hitch tried to force the 
appointment. Although Grobstein might well have passed on an 
actual vote. Hitch , still in a weak position. would not act 
without the explicit support 01 one of a few influential Regents. 
Smith and Reagan among them. For reasons explained. this 
was not forthcoming. though neither of these men actually 
oppo,ed Grobstein. 

In Jiay. supporters of Jones and Grob tein all but despaired. 
But several recent phone calls to Reagan have. according to 
two sources with independent inlormation. 'now changed the 
picture. The callers. men whom Reagan does know. have 
feportedl~' told the Governor that he had "misread" the 
si tuation. and that "almost all the men of substance in the 
communit~·" are tavorably disposed toward Grobstein. 

There has been one other deve lopment. A Grobstein 
supporter told the TIMES that he has personall~' gone to three 
men counted as pro-Jones. and asked them to indicate to the 
Governor that they do not oppose Grobstein, This source said 
he believed that these expressions of "non-opposition" would 
convince the Governor that any action taken on behall of 
Grobstein would not damage his relations to the majorit~· of 
Jones supporters. 

The result of this. the TIMES has been told . is that Reagan 
will now act to bring Grobstein's name to a vote. He could 
probably accomplish this simply b~' assuring president Hitch of 
his own su pport. 

At any rate. Reagan has probably been put in a position 
where not acting might damage his relations with the San 
Diego business community. And it is electoral majorities from 
San Diego and Orange countie . after all. that Reagan will need 
if he again ,eeks office in California. 

One last fact closes the circle. The Regents will complete 
work on the budget in June, Thus conservative Regents would 
no longer have an immediate lever of retaliation against Hitch 
if Grobstein were nominated. According to these same 
sources. Hitch will therefore nominate Grobstein inJulv. 

All of these developments could easil~' be nullilied if the 
earch Committee cam.e up with a better candidate. But as 

James Arnold. chairman 01 that committee. woefullv notes. 
. 'The people we think are desirable are also the ones th'at other 
people think are desirable. And there is a great demand for 
college-president> these days. " 

And the busine,smen. meanwhile. seem determined , "There 
are men in this to\\,n who arl' going to pursue this to the biller 
end." one businessman lOld the TniES. " SO that at thi, point 
Grobstein looks like a ver\, live candidate." 

Grobstein. who has never announced hi s candidae\' . would 
not comment. The TIMES has lound no evidence. however . 
that Grobstein has solicited any of this determined support.

Muir Search Committee 
Selects Beckley as Dean 
John Muir College has a new dean. His name is James 

Beckley. and the Muir College Dean's Search Committee 
believes he \\'i11 make a strong contribution to developing 
programs. faculty-student communications and student 
involvement. 

Beckley's experience includes serving as consultant at State 
\.,'niversi ty of l\:ew York College at Buffalo in the development 
of orientation and peer counseling programs. incorporating 
new styles of student participation: the director of admission 
and fina ncial aid at Case Western Reserve Universit\' ; and . at 
the Stat l,;niversit~' of :\ew York at Buffalo. a major figure in 
the foundi ng of an experimental college. 

The Search Committee wanted to stress how the decision on 
Beckley was made. "From a large group 01 candidates we 
selected a final group of eight whom we considered 
impressive. to invite to UCSD. Each 01 these spent a da~' or 
more talking to most of the Search Committee and other 
people - learning the expectations of the job and becoming 
known to us. We tound much to like, and atth~t point our task 
became one of determining which candidate \\'tuld best meet 
the present and luture needs of John Muir College. 

"This was an intense. often exciting. difficult job. We on the 
Search Committee are a diverse group of seventeen people : 
student. tacult\,. administrators. staff. We did not alwavs 
agree. partly because we are all involved in the College in quite 
different ways. and our expectations of the dean also differ. In 
the beginning. each had his favorites among the eight tinal 
candidates. and obviou s l~' not everyone got ever~· thing he 
wanted. But we \\'ere open with each other ". and as \\'e pooled 
our impression of the men and the qualities needed for the jpb. 

man~' of us changed our perceptions and preferences. As the 
discussion progressed . there was a real move to\\,ard 
consensus. 

The Search Committee feels that in addition to making a 
very good choice for dean of John Muir College, they have 
established "a new sense that the diverse elements 
represented on the Committee can work together effectively, 
and that this unity, on broader scales, could produce a stronger 
sense of community in John Muir College as a whole."

Too Many Chancellor-makers 
Law and tradition stipulate that the 

UC president, in consultation with the 
local search committee and certain 
Regents, should make the nomination 
for a new chancellor to the full Board 
of Regents. It has now been l8-months 
since William McGill has announced 
his resignation, aM no nomination has 
been made. 

This is regrettable. But what is 
deplorable is that the action, such as it 
has been, has taken place everywhere 
else but in consultation between the 
president and responsible 
representatives of the campus and the 
Regents. A group of UCSD faculty, 
including the irrepressible Jack 
Douglas, were the first to violate that 
process. By their own admission, they 
put their "thumb in the dike." 

Next on the long agenda of 
interferences were some right-wing 
extremists on the Board of Regents 
who were trying to dump President 
Charles Hitch. We suppose their 
intentions were good, but we would 
appreciate it if they would not let 
UCSD become a pawn in their game. 
Finally, veritable hordes of San Diego 
businessmen became locked in a 

combat over which of their candidates 
would become chancellor . We do not 
mean that these people should have 
kept entirely to themselves, but they 
should not have taken it upon 
themselves to exert the pressure they 
did on the King Regent, Ronald 
Reagan . 

Now the governor probably will act, 
and will i{1 fact probably exert the 
decisive influence, but only because he 
can't afford to alienate certain 
businessmen. As it happens, he will 
favor a candidate who has been 
through the gamut of due process, but 
this is an accident. Reagan would have 
installed Mickey Mouse (or Hardin 
Jones) if he thought it was necessary 
to soothe the feelings of his own 
business supporters. 

These events are harmful to the 
campus and to the University as a 
whole. There is a lesson to be learned, 
a very old lesson. The University must 
not become anyone's political football. 
This applies to the San Diego business 
crowd as well as Jack Douglas. It has 
only caused a delay this time. Next 
time it may be worse. 

Registration Fees Allocations 
Yesterday an ad hoc committee 

presented a budget proposal to the 
Registration Committee. This report 
represented the fruit of six weeks of 
work. We are not questioning the 
results of the report at this time; this 
would be impossible in the limited 
time that it was available to us. 

What we are questioning is the 
procedure with which this document 
was drawn up. The foremost fault we 
see with the process is that the work 
was started far too late in the year. 
Certain factors, such as the fact that 
peoples' jobs were at stake, caused 
some of the results of the meetings to 
be held confidential. The question as to 
the desirability of this procedure 
needs also to be looked into in depth. 
The combination of the late start and 
the closed nature of the hearings 
caused the release of the information 
to be delayed until this late date. 

This action should not be repeated; 
new procedures for the formulation of 
these recommendations should be 
implemented to correct this situation 

before next year. We have spoken to 
members of the Ad Hoc Committee on 
this subject and have received 
encouraging replies. We believe that 
this process of budgetary 
investigation should begin early in the 
year. With an early start it would be 
possible to attempt a much greater 
influx of student input in the 
investigatory stages. This process 
would also allow the student media to 
keep the student body appraised of the 
situation. 

This type of procedure that is now in 
effect, with recommendation made 
just as students are preparing to 
leave, must come to an end. 

A footnote to the above editorial : In 
yesterday's Registration Fee Meeting 
two student-run projects, KSDT and 
the Experimental Theater, were 
criticized by administration members 
of the committee. This criticism and 
any further ones are beyond the reach 
of the student media. With the 
decision-making process delayed uatil 
after the students have left, any 
student voice is stilled.

The AS 

Happenings at The AS 
Tom Deits 

AS Public Relations Director 
This column hopefully will be a regular 

feature next year. My aim is to present an 
informal discussion of what Uie Associated 
Students is doing ; what we spend money on, 
what opportunities there are for people through 
the AS, and to help us respond to your needs by 
opening another channel Qf communication, 

First off, I would like to extend a personal 
invitation to anyone out there who might be 
interested in public relations, communications, 
poster painting, or related stuff. Call 453-2000, 
ext. 1913 (the AS office) and leave your name 
and number- I'll get in touch with you, as 
there's lots to be done. I'm sure I can extend 
this invitation on behalf of all commissioners. 
There is in all likelihood a facet of AS that you 
would find interesting, and if there isn't, come 
on in and make one! 

What with the financial aids crisis, (did you 
know that at current levels 72% of EOP 
applicants at UC will have to be rejected for 
lack of funds?). Juan Lopez, Commissioner of 
Community Service has come up with a 
proposal for fellowships for community service, 
financed by the United States Catholic 
Conference and administered through the 
Chicano Federation. Any qualified student will 
be able to receive essentially work-study aid for 
specific work with community organizations in 
San Diego. Funding and final details are not yet __ 
complete, so don't knock down Juan's door 
today, but keep this one in mind if you want to 
help your community and earn some bread to 
stay in school. More will be forthcoming. 

Dick Twohy, the lobbyist hired by the 
Associated Students of all UC campuses came 
to the AS meeting Tuesday night to give the 
students a progress report. By the way, our 
funding of his office is expected to be around 
$3,000 next year, about 75¢ per student. He came 
armed with a mass of legislation he is 
supporting, opposing, and watching, ranging 
from a bill to raise graduate tuition to $2,500 
per year (it won't pass, with our belp) to a bill 
to tax cigarettes five cents a pack to finance UC 
medical research (he's watching this one with 
interest). He will report to the AS presidents 
regularly next year with proposals for 
legislation in the interest of UC, to be brought 
up with the students for our thoughts and 
approval. In addition, there will be internships 
available every quarter, about six or seven at 
first, to act as " Twohy's Raiders" in 
researching and drafting needed legisla lion. 
Credit might be arranged and it would be a 
great learning experience in any event. 

Another proposal presented was for the 
establishment of an office of Coordinator of Off 
Campus Housing, a paid position. His job would 
be to aid students in improving their legal and 
financial position when they deal with 
landlords. Anyone who has been ripped off on a 
cleaning deposit knows the problem well. You 
would be able to bring leases to the office to 
learn what the fine print really means, find 
referrals for roommates and available, honest 
housing, and many other services, all student 
oriented and worthwhile. More on this too. The 
projected level of funding for this summer to 
get started and next year is $2,600, to be 
discussed at the next AS meeting. This meeting 
will have been held before this column comes 
out. In the fu ture the da tes and places of all AS 
meetings will be announced here. You are 
cordially invited to attend. 

If anything you read in this column interests 
you, drop by or call the AS office. I look forward 
to working with many of you next year. Let's 
keep in touch. The AS can only be as effective as 
we want to make it!

Is A Loser A Winner? 
The capacity ot Karl Keating 

and Jim Sills to turn defeat into 
seemmg victory constantly' 
amazes me. In \'our last is ue. 
Sills claims the results ot a 
referendum with a very small 
voter turnout wa s a n 
endorsement of his and 
Keating 's policies. Then. he 
characteristically pretends 
that Keating's defeat at the 
polls was really not deteat. but 
voter re'!,ction against the 
portrai t painted by his 
enemies. How strange that he 
does not si milarl~' represent his
