Berkeley Law student Jonathan Stein 
has been nominated by a special selection 
committee to become the 2012-13 UC 
Student Regent. If approved at the regents’ 
meeting in July, Stein will become the 
Student Regent-designate next year, when 
he will attend all meetings, but be unable to 
vote. He will become a full voting member 
in 2012-13. 

The current Student Regent is UC San 
Francisco student Alfredo Mireles Jr. After 
serving as Student Regent-designate this 
year, Mireles was scheduled to become 
Student Regent in July but began his term 
early after 2010-11 regent and UC Irvine 
senior Jesse Cheng resigned after being 
found guilty of sexual assaulting a 22-year-
old UCLA Law School.

Of 56 applicants, the UC Student 
Association interviewed 10 semifinalists,  
then recommended three finalists to 
the special committee who made the 
nomination. Stein, who received a BA in 
English from Harvard University, expects to 
graduate in May 2013. 

According to a statement from 
UCOP, Stein’s goals as student regent 
include addressing issues of accessibility, 
affordability, diversity and campus climate 
in the following year.

Nominated to 
Become Next 
Student Regent

UCSD chemistry and 
biochemistry professor Clifford 
Kubiak issued a public apology on 
Monday, May 23 for a racist slur 
posted on his webpage.

The webpage contained a set of 
rules, including “no Disney music,” 
“don’t be that guy,” “if you can’t turn 
on the instrument, you shouldn’t 
use it” and “don’t believe everything 
Chinaman says.”

The last rule gained prominence 
and news coverage after it was 
posted on an Internet forum for 
Chinese-speaking academics. The 
word “chinaman” is a historically 
derogatory term for Chinese people 
or anyone perceived to be of an East 
Asian race. UCSD officials then took 
the page down over the weekend, as 
soon as the chemistry department 
became aware of it. 

According to Kubiak’s letter of 
apology, he was unaware of his lab 
rules. 

“Although I was unaware of the 
existence of this page until it was 
brought to my attention, I accept 
full responsibility,” Kubiak said in his 
letter of apology.

The Department of Chemistry 
and Biochemistry issued an apology 
as well and asked the Office for 
Prevention of Harassment and 
Discrimination to look into the 
matter.

S tudents are calling for the reinstatement of the Di-rector of Development for 
Initiatives Ana Baiz-Torres, af-
ter she was fired for undisclosed 
reasons. 

According to the San Diego 
Union Tribune, university 
spokesperson Jeff Gattas 
announced the news before a 
May 12 Campus Council on 
Climate, Diversity and Inclusion 
meeting.

“Ana Baiz-Torres is no 

longer with the university’s 
development department, 
effective immediately,” Gattas 
said.

Baiz-Torres was appointed 
in October 2010 in response to 
last year’s racial incidents, as 
part of the agreement signed 
March 4 that called for the 
creation of a position to fund for 
diversity initiatives. The Campus 
Council on Climate, Diversity 
and Inclusion — composed 
of faculty, administration and 
representatives from Movimiento 

Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán, 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, Black Student Union 
and Muslim Student Association 
— meets approximately once a 
month to discuss progress on the 
agreements to increase diversity 
that stemmed from last year’s 
“Compton Cookout” incident. 
According to an October 2010 
campus press release, Baiz-Torres 
was responsible for fundraising 
for diversity initiatives such as

A.S. Council Appoints 2011-
12 Associate Vice Presidents
By Rebecca Horwitz
Associate News Editor

A.S. Council has appointed the new 
Associate Vice Presidents for next year.

The AVP applications became available 

on the A.S. website about a month ago, 
and candidates were chosen after 
being interviewed by a committee of 
councilmembers. The stipend for AVPs is 
$3,500 a year.

Vice President of Student Life Meredith 

Madnick, who sat on the committee, said 
she chooses applicants based on which 
prospective members have tangible goals and 
the strongest understanding of the position.

“A varying amount of senators sit on 
these committees,” Madnick said. “There 

is a diverse amount 
of opinions and 
hopefully council 
will trust those 
decisions.”

Former Muir 
College Senator 
Lynne Swerhone 
is the new AVP 
of  Student 
O r g a n i z a t i o n s . 
Swerhone said 
that she wants 
to improve the 
student-org funding 
process by offering 
finance workshops, 
collaborate with 

One Stop and revise council policies on 
funding media and food.

Researchers Make Discovery That Could End Spam Email
By Sarah Kang
Staff Writer

Spam emails could be eradicated 
once and for all, now that UCSD 
computer scientists have found the 
key source behind the unwanted 
junk. Researchers led by Kirill 
Levchenko started two years ago and 
have determined that all spam email 
is sent out in order for sponsoring 
organizations to sell the products 
advertised in the emails, and these 
organizations handle transactions 
through only a few banks. Of the 
15 authors of the study, 10 are from 
UCSD.

Computer scientists looked at one 
billion spam emails that they obtained 
via feeds from Google, Microsoft, 
Yahoo and other companies. Over a 
span of three months in 2010, the 
scientists visited the websites the spam 
emails linked to. They analyzed the 
infrastructure these sites used, looking 
at where they were hosted, which 
server names and name registrars were 
used. They then grouped the websites 

together based on the organization 
funding the spam-linked websites and 
purchased $4,000 worth of goods from 
these organizations. The products 
purchased included pharmaceutical 
products, replica luxury goods and 
counterfeit software — in other words, 
the products most widely advertised in 
the spam emails.

According to the 15 researchers, 
spam systems depend on registrars, 
website hosting and payment for 
products bought through spam 
email links. They discovered that the 
infrastructure of the spam ecosystem 
was complex, with server computers, 
manufacturers and banks spread 
out in different locations. This wide 
distribution complicates the problem 
of how to eradicate spam. 

In one case, a spam email sent out 
by a bot linked those who clicked on 
the advertised URL to a website with 
its domain registrar in Russia, its server 
computer in China, the merchant bank 
in Azerbaijan and the manufacturer 
in India. 

According to the paper, the most 

effective means of preventing spam 
would be to interfere in the banking 
component of the spam system.

By analyzing the data gathered 
from spam purchases, the researchers 
also found that the payment step made 
the purchaser vulnerable. 

The researchers found that Visa and 
Mastercard are the only two credit card 
processors handling the in-between 
transactions within the spam system.

“In the end, we found that the spam 
ecosystem depends on a relatively 
small number of banks to handle their 
merchant accounts and accept Visa 
payment from potential customers,” 
computer science and engineering 
professor Stefan Savage wrote in an 
email.

According to the researchers, 
regulation and enforcement can 
effectively control the spam system 
because it relies on a few banks and 
credit card processors. If the U.S. 
banks issuing credit cards refused to 
handle spam-related transactions, then 
the spam ecosystem would lose its 
profitability. 

Now that researchers have 
determined how to break up the 
spam system, the information can be 
used to deter banks from serving the 
organizations responsible for spam. 
The researchers have informed all the 
stakeholders involved, such as brand 
holders, U.S. regulatory bodies and 
large-scale mail providers.

newS THURSDAY, MAY 26, 2011 THe UCSD GUARDIAn 3 

This week’s council meeting began with former Associate Vice President of Concerts 
and Events Brian Wong formally 
introducing his replacement and 
former media 
liason, Oliver 
Zhang.

Associate 
Vice President 
of Student 
Organizations 
Carli Thomas 
followed by 
talking about the growth of student 
organizations on campus and how 
they are requesting more money.

Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Arohi Sharma 
discussed the doubled turnout and 
participation of “Discover the Law”, 
also ending on the note that more 
funding is required. Sharma said she 
plans to talk to GSA about student 
advocacy to encourage it on the 
graduate level. 

President Alyssa Wing spoke 
next about the imminent library 
closures. “It’s really important that 
we take urgency in this matter, and 
I think it’s a twofold plan—one, a 
stance of resolution, how we feel 
about it, and a solution, and two, to 
involve students,” she said.

Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick asked Wing 
how likely the resolution was to 
cause the administration to rethink 
the closures, to which she replied 
that she thought student input on 
the matter was an important step 
toward reversing their decision. 

Muir College Council Chair 
Jessie Rosales then gave a special 
presentation about the CLICS 
task force, suggesting a temporary 
student fee to keep the space open 
with or without computers. 
Alyssa Wing then submitted a 

resolution to reopen CLICS, which 
passed. 

Vice President of External Affairs 
of Samer Naji introduced President 
of SOPAC Arshya Sharifian, who 

gave a 20 minute 
presentation 
about SOPAC, 
a student 
organization 
dedicated to 
expanding 
the amount 
of registered 

voters on campus. Apparently only 
9 percent of UCSD students are 
registered voters. I’m disappointed 
in us.

Next up were Associate Vice 
President appointments, which hit 
a roadblock. Although most were 
appointed without objection, the 
AS Council mysteriously closed its 
doors to the public around 8 p.m. 
without explaining why. It was only 
after the doors opened that I learned 
there was some debate about one 
of the Associate Vice President 
positions.

Next up, the most important part 
of this week’s meeting: the budget. 
Debate raged over a decrease in the 
Fall Festival Budget from $135,000 
to $50,000, but it passed. VP Student 
Affairs assured the council that the 
Fall Festival would not suffer as a 
result. 

A new category opened to fund 
70 percent of the salary for the 
position of Campus Events Manager, 
for which $36,750 was allocated. 

Debate continued for over 30 
minutes involving senator and 
Associate Vice President stipends, 
some council members arguing that 
the stipends should be removed 
from the budget with others 
contesting. In the end, there was no 
change.

SSC to Focus on Promoting on Fair Trade Policy Next Year

Students Question University’s Committment to Diversity
the Chicano and African-American 
Studies minors. 

Student members of the 
committee said they believe Torres’ 
termination, as well as university 
representatives who decline to 
comment on the situation, calls into 
question the university’s commitment 
to diversity. According to Student 
Affirmative Action Committee Vice 
Chair Josue Castellon, Baiz-Torres 
was reportedly fired for not doing 
her job.

“It’s invalidating the work she’s 
done,” Castellon said.“The school is 
not telling us the reason [she was 
fired].  We are asking the school for 

transparency and accountability.”
The university’s diversity 

requirement, implemented this year, 
is a start to improving campus climate 
but work still needs to be done, 
Castellon said. The new Chicano 
Legacy mural was completed 
in response to these demands, 
but Castellon said the demands 
also called for multiple pieces of 
campus artwork to represent 
underrepresented students. 

Other demands include hiring 
faculty of color, which so far has 
been denied, Castellon said. 
Castellon added the significance 
of Baiz-Torres’ role as a Chicana 
representative on university faculty 

and said the demands cannot be 
implemented without her. 

“She was actually changing 
campus climate at the administrative 
level,” Castellon said. “Everything 
she did was for the students.” 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue declined to comment 
because it is a personnel issue, but 
said that this action does not change 
the university’s commitment to 
improving campus climate.

“This campus’s commitment to 
this position is unwavering,” Rue 
said in an email. “Melanie Cruz has 
been appointed as Interim Director 
of Development for Diversity

water and 16 gallons of oil just to 
make the plastic bottle itself,” SSC 
Director of Food Policy Jared Muscat 
said.

Former A.S. President Wafa Ben 
Hassine worked with Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality to ban on-campus 
sale of plastic water bottles by the end 
of Spring Quarter. 

The SSC is collaborating with 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality to 
create a proposal so that on-campus 
hydration stations will offer filtered 
water readily available to students by 
Fall 2012.

“Instead of having plastic water 
bottles, the dining halls will have 
reusable water bottles for sale,” 
Muscat said. “It’ll help reduce the 
waste on campus and help what’s now 
about to become a UC-wide effort of 
breaking the plastic habit.”

Student organizations are hosting 
other various campaigns throughout 
the campus.

“The Public Health group 
is working on the Born Beautiful 

campaign,” SSC Director of Public 
Health Elizabeth Elman said. “The 
purpose of that is three-fold. The first 
is to encourage UCSD students to 
recognize and appreciate the intrinsic 
beauty. The second is to challenge 
the stereotypical portrayal of beauty 
that media, Photoshopping and 
advertisements perpetuate. And the 
third focus is to bring attention to 
‘pink washing.’” 

“Pink washing” is when 
companies promote carcinogen-
producing products by claiming 
they support breast cancer research. 
According to Elman, companies 
guilty of pink washing spend more 
money advertising the fact that they 
donate to breast cancer research than 
they actually do donating.

The Corporate Accountability 
Group is currently promoting Alta 
Gracia —  a apparel brand found 
at the bookstore that provides its 
workers and their families with basic 
educational, health, food, water and 
shelter needs. 

“It comes from a factory that used 

to be a sweatshop factory,” Elman 
said. “But it’s become unionized, and 
the workers reopened the factory 
with the union. So now they get paid 
a living wage, and the clothes aren’t 
made in sweatshop conditions.” 

The SSC will focus on promoting 
Fair Trade Policy, which got approved 
during 10th week of Spring Quarter 
last year, moving forward with Alta 
Gracia in the bookstore and also 
promoting sustainable local food and 
water on campus.

Members of the SSC will also sit 
in on committees and meetings with 
Housing and Dining to make sure 
that the policies that both parties have 
agreed on are being implemented 
properly. 

“For every year, we want to see 
through the implementation of 
these policies because although we 
pass the policies, usually most of 
the responsibility on the policies is 
in Housing and Dining’s hands, and 
sometimes the implementation can

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG/oPINIoNTHURSDAY, MAY 26, 2011

There’s a golden rule when it comes to getting free stuff — the less people know about 
it, the more fun it is to get it and, 
of course, the greater the feeling of 
accomplishment. (That’s why the free 
pizza at that little-publicized engineer-
ing fair is always more exciting than 
the college council events offering free 
soda.) So, the ideal free situation is 
to find a popular store and be “in the 
know” about getting free stuff (code 
words included) before everyone else. 

Using this logic, events like Ben 

and Jerry’s “Free Cone Day” on April 
12 or IHOP’s “Free Pancake Day” on 
March 1, are the ultimate antithesis 
of this golden rule. Broadcast far and 
wide, publicized with Facebook events 
that have six-digit numbers of people 
attending, these free days always bring 
in hordes of hungry weirdos (myself 
included), and thus, the best and 
worst of humanity. 

The worst of the worst is always 
Chipotle’s Free Burrito Day on 
Halloween. They stopped this tradi-
tion in 2010, but a couple of years 
back, every Chipotle on Oct. 31 had a 
line curling around the block. Drunk, 
high and hungry college students 
waited for hours for a free burrito 
— the majority of them covered in 
aluminum foil of varying strips and 
sizes. The thought of braving hours of 
standing behind some drunken frat 
bro dressed like a burrito with a beer 
belly killed my appetite, and I walked 
away without even trying. Sometimes, 
you have to pick your battles. 

The best things in life are free, 
so when I get coerced into spend-
ing money, I am irate. IHOP’s Free 
Pancake Day seemed innocuous 
enough at first — my friend and I 
were seated almost immediately. But 
their free pancake day only involved 
a short stack, and being the hungry 
Americans that we were, we didn’t 
just want three measly pancakes for 
brunch. We wanted sides — more 
specifically, bacon. With the extra 
side orders, our “cheap” meal ended 
up costing $14 plus tip. Let that be 
a warning to you: Be vigilant when 
partaking in these “free days” — your 
empty stomach might hoodwink you.

But sometimes it’s worth it. On 
paper, Ben and Jerry’s Free Cone Day 
sounded like a miserable waiting game 
— thankfully, I was wrong. I assumed 
the tiny stand outside the UTC food 
court could hardly handle the masses 
of eager ice cream fans demand-
ing their fix of Cherry Garcia and 
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But 
when my friends and I arrived, the 
line was a pleasantly short five-minute 
wait. And even though my favorite 
flavor wasn’t offered (seriously, try 
Imagine Whirled Peace; it will change 
your entire perspective on life), their 
equally sublime Milk & Cookies flavor 
was, so I was stoked. 

The free ice cream was great, but 
the moment that made my day was 
when a woman with three kids pulled 
out her wallet to pay for her family’s 
ice cream. Clearly, she had missed the 
enormous “Free Cone Day” sign that 
dominated the better part of the stand. 
When the man behind the counter 
told her that there was no charge, she 
looked stunned, smiled and cautiously 
walked away. Never underestimate the 
power of free to make someone’s day 
that much better.

Sometimes, 
It’s Go Free, 
or Go Home

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 
Dear Editor,

I am responding to “Quick Takes” 
from Page 4 of the May 23 Guardian
issue, where Guardian writers sug-
gest that the ACLU is wrong to fight 
against censorship at La Jolla High 
School. The ACLU’s position is in 
agreement with American law and 
the principles of free expression, 
while the positions of these writers 
are not.

If speech is allowed some place at 
a school, the administration is not 
allowed to decide what kind of 
speech is permitted there. The high 
school may be allowed, as Hilary 
Lee writes, to limit the “time, place 
and manner” in which ideas are 
expressed, but it cannot make a cen-
sorship decision based on the opin-
ion-content of a public statement. 

This is the same reason UCSD is not 
allowed to defund the Koala, nor 
prevent some hysterical professors 
from purchasing full-page Guardian 
advertisements.

It is illegal to stifle expression 
based on content (unless the content 
is explicitly threatening to someone). 
If La Jolla High School allows any 
message to be painted on these 
benches, then it must allow all mes-
sages.

They are not allowed to decide 
which areas of campus are desig-
nated “political” and which are for 
“birthday wishes.” This is not my or 
the ACLU’s opinion; it is the law.

Even if an act of expression 
makes some people severely uncom-
fortable and even if it is monstrously 
offensive, censoring it is still illegal. 
Previous high-profile ACLU cases 
(in defense of the North American 
Man/Boy Love Association, the 
Westboro Baptist Church and oth-

ers) were not “questionably appropri-
ate,” as Arik Burakovsky writes. The 
ACLU was defending the law from 
people who want to babysit your 
mind, from people who patronize 
you by saying that you aren’t mature 
enough to decide for yourself wheth-
er someone else’s view is correct.

These Guardian writers should at 
least make sure that they understand 
what the ACLU’s position is before 
criticizing the organization. If they 
still find that they disagree with 
free speech laws, so be it. But they 
haven’t spent the time to learn the 
reasoning behind the ACLU’s enor-
mous campaign to protect unpopu-
lar viewpoints.

During your next staff meeting, 
consider educating yourselves on the 
principles of free expression. Why 
not encourage your staff writers to 
read a few books or passages by 
John Milton and John Stewart Mill? 
University newspapers are supposed 

to be advocates of the most stringent 
free speech standards, not piffling 
apologists for censors.

Dear Editor,
I am writing to extinguish the 

complaints made in a previous 
letter to the editor regarding the 
Guardian not accepting an adver-
tisement called “The Palestinians’ 
Case Against Israel is Based on a 
Genocidal Lie.” Frankly, the writer 
seems to enjoy tossing around fancy 
jargon such as “censorship,” “sup-
pressing free speech” and “free press” 
as an attempt to make a point that is 
irrelevant to the case in question.

Protests Cause Tense 
Campus Climate

A new task force formed to save CLICS may have the right intentions, but a lack of planning and 
viable solutions will ultimately do nothing to keep the library open.

Too Little, Too Late

Sometimes, wasting your time on a futile goal earns you a pat on the 
back and a “good try, slugger.” 
Other times, it earns you the 
ambivalence of 20,000 peers

Nearly two months after 
the university announced 
plans to close several UCSD 
libraries, Muir College 
Council Chair Jessie Rosales 
assembled a task force was 
assembled to save CLICS. 

The group’s most feasible 
option seems to be proposing 
a referendum that, if passed, 
would not go into effect 
until a year after the appar-
ently beloved study space is 
scheduled to be shut down. 
Although the task force 
means well, the gap between 
now and when any work 
would become visible is far 
too long.  Good intentions 
aside — it is now Week Nine 
and CLICS is scheduled to 
close immediately after finals. 

And the good news 
doesn’t stop there; according 
to university librarian Brian 
Schottlaender, the current 
$3-million cut to the library 

budget is the best-case sce-
nario (using the word “best” 
loosely) — this means that, 
believe it or not, we’re lucky 
the university is closing a 
whopping five libraries and 
not doing worse.  In the face 
of such grim realities, there’s 
little room for Rosales’s 
impromptu task force — no 
matter how ear-
nest — to save 
the day.

It’s refresh-
ing that 
someone is 
taking action 
beyond yet 
another “KEEP 
CLICS OPEN” 
Facebook 
group, and 
Rosales is mak-
ing a noble 
effort. He’s narrowed the 
focus of his task force to one 
library rather than attempting 
to save all of them, refocused 
attention onto the library 
crisis, a fate most students 
have already accepted and has 
even recruited 15 members. 
The task force hopes to pres-

ent its proposals — including 
proposals to turn CLICS into 
a “student-run space“ (think 
co-op but with books instead 
of food and marijuana) and 
create an $8 quarterly stu-
dent fee  — to the Academic 
Affairs department by sum-
mer. 

But this can’t make up for 
a lack of plan-
ning and fea-
sible options, as 
Rosales’s efforts 
are ultimately a 
bad case of “too 
little, too late.” 

As nice as 
it is to think 
that students 
would volun-
tarily work 
at CLICS to 
keep it open, 

labor-free alternatives like 
Price Center, Perks Cafe 
and even the dorm study 
lounges are — despite 
being slightly louder — 
cost-free, accessible alter-
natives. 

Even if there was 
enough student interest, 

volunteers wouldn’t even 
be qualified to be interim 
librarians for the year, see-
ing as UCSD does not offer a 
Masters in Library Science. 

Though student libraries 
are often essential to study 
(and for the truly downtrod-
den, eat and sleep), this can 
be done at plenty of other 
spaces on campus. The origi-
nal point of libraries, lest we 
forget, is to check out books, 
and librarians are in charge 
of this data organization — a 
skill even the most studious

coed is unlikely to have. 
As for a referendum, the time 

gap between now and 2012 elec-
tions is just too big. During the 
year-long gap between the clos-
ing of the libraries and the actual 
referendum (if it passes), students 
will have no choice but to find 
alternative study spaces which they 
will get used to, ultimately making 
Team CLICS obsolete. And let’s be 
honest, students rarely, if ever, sup-
port fee increases. 

The $8 per-student per-quarter 
fee is not worth it. Students out-
wardly oppose additional fees 
tacked onto their tuitions and, with 
the year-long gap between now 
and the far-fetched possibility that 

CLICS will reopen, students will 
find other options. Asking students 
to care about an abandoned build-
ing for a year is ridiculous, seeing 
as UCSD students have enough 
trouble staying in a relationship for 
that long (ahem, Triton Eye).

The Department of Academic 
Affairs — the university division 
the task force must answer to — has 
already informed Rosales that it 
believes saving CLICS is not fea-
sible. 

Rosales has called this reaction a 
“slap in the face,” but the university, 
after enduring millions in crip-
pling budget cuts, is simply being 
realistic. 

Although it would be ideal to 
keep what’s left of our libraries 

from becoming overcrowded, the 
convoluted nature of university 
bureaucracy has proven itself unre-
sponsive to many student propos-
als, especially those with bad tim-
ing and half-baked ideas.   

It’s nice to see fellow students 
showing some sort of an emotional 
attachment to our campus and it’s 
even more exciting that they are 
trying to prioritize our education, 
but good thoughts won’t bridge a 
$3-million budget gap. 

Nice try, task force, but it looks 
like CLICS is gone for good. It’s 
time to fight at the source by lob-
bying for more state funding. In 
the meanwhile, we should probably 
settle for finding a new location to 
chug Red Bulls and write papers.

The MenTAl Fishbowl By Alex Nguyen 

Delay in Referendum Will Just Draw Out the Inevitable
▶ ClICs, from page 4

Essentially, the argument made 
is: “I am paying for this ad; there-
fore, I should be allowed to run it. 
Not accepting my money to let me 
advance my agenda via the Guardian 
is censorship and limiting freedom 
of the press.” The flaws in this logic 
are extremely obvious, and frankly 
embarrassing to read, as an aca-
demic. 

To address them concisely:
We are talking about an adver-

tisement; we are not dealing with an 
op-ed that the Guardian asked to be 
written, nor with an article written 
by the staff. 

The Guardian has no obligation 
to this third-party company that is 
looking to advertise its position.

That being said, the term “cen-
sorship” implies that the individual 
originally had a right to use this 
medium to speak and was deprived 
of such a right. 

The fact that the Guardian was 
offered money to run this advertise-
ment clearly shows that there was 
never an inherent obligation to print 
the advertisement.

The press expressed its freedom 
in denying the advertisement to be 
published. It was purely the paper’s 
choice to reject the advertisement. 
Whether this individual likes it or 
not, that action is freedom of the 
press.

The Guardian, I am assuming, 
rejected this advertisement par-
ticularly because of its blatant racial 
attack of the Palestinian narrative, 
as opposed to an attack of the argu-
ments presented from the pro-Pales-

tinian and pro-human-rights side of 
the conflict. I applaud the Guardian 
for prioritizing cultural sensitivity 
over allowing an individual to pay 
his or her way into the media.

I am disappointed at the lack of 
common sense that was incorpo-
rated into the letter in question. 

Clearly, as most academics can 
see, this was not an issue regarding 
censorship, nor freedom of the press. 

Though these words may make 
an individual sound intelligent, with-
out proper backing the individual’s 
case holds no merit, and as a result, 
can be regarded as no more than a 
flawed argument by a party that is 
sour because it didn’t get its way. 

On a final note, I am a 
Palestinian and I do exist. 

My culture, in all of its unique-
ness, is Palestinian and has devel-
oped over the years as a Palestinian 
culture. 

Yes, we may not have an official 
nation (yet), but we do exist as a 
people. I respectfully ask the writer 
of the letter in question not to advo-
cate otherwise.

giving them much,” Swerhone said.            
AVP of Academic Affairs and 

2010-11 Warren College Senator 
Maclen Zilber said he will focus 
on pushing Senate to create a 
bereavement policy. 

“If a student has a family member 
pass away, the university has no 
policy to get them the ability to drop 
with a “W,” Zilber said. “This is not 
legally or morally right.”

Zilber said he also wants to 
create a service on the A.S. Council 
website that allows students to 
project their grade in a class they 
have not yet taken using formula 
created from data available from 
evaluations. 

Students would enter their grade 
point average, year and major onto 
the website and it would project a 
grade based on similar students’ 
data.

“Currently, UCSD has the least 
grade inflation of any university 
graduates at competitive schools,” 
Zilber said. “We’re at a disadvantage. 
Students should have more of an 
idea of what they’re getting into 

when they sign up for classes.”
Warren College sophomore 

Leonard Bobbitt will be continuing 
his position of AVP of College 
Affairs. 

“It’ll give me a chance to expand 
the goals of the office,” Bobbitt said.

He said he would like to create 
a year-round competition between 
the colleges, as well as a quarterly 
collaborative charity drive between 
the college councils and A.S. 
Council. 

The new AVP of Student 
Services, Leigh Mason, completed 
a project before she was approved. 

She signed documents with 
Madnick which make A.S. Safe 
Rides available the first week of Fall 
Quarter. In the past they have not 
been available until October.

“I came as a winter admit and I 
didn’t know all of the opportunities 
to volunteer on campus,” Mason 
said. “Now I can make students 
aware of the resources.”

SCC will also continue to work on

Other initiatives include the

TONIGHT

S teven Spielberg’s summertime blockbuster “Cowboys and Aliens” may be drawing derisive laughter 
because of its ridiculous premise, but 
this is by no means the first — and 
certainly not the best — of the sci-fi 
western genre. That honor belongs to 
Joss Whedon’s cult show, “Firefly.”

It may now be regarded as one 
of the most brilliant, misunderstood 
wonders to emerge from the depths of 
Whedon’s mind — because honestly, 
only he would choose to set a space 
opera-western in 2057 where the char-
acters spoke a mixture of Mandarin 
Chinese and English — but when the 
show came out in 2002 nobody really 
bothered to watch. And I’ll be honest: 
I didn’t either. In my defense though, 
I was in the 6th grade and my parents 
believed television should be restricted 
to the Food Network — I guess they 
felt that watching food porn was bet-
ter than watching actual porn, I mean, 
MTV. 

Though it boasted an impressive 
pedigree — Whedon’s previous two 
shows, the popular yet cult hit “Buffy 
the Vampire Slayer” and its spin-off 
“Angel” — only garnered 6.3 mil-
lion viewers in the pilot, and it was 
all downhill from there. In the end, 
only 11 of 14 episodes were even aired 
on Fox, and “Firefly’s” diehard fans 
— self-named “Browncoats” — were 
heartbroken and looking for someone 
to blame.

In many ways, it was Fox’s fault. 
Instead of airing the slower-paced 
but poignant 90-minute pilot that 
set the stage for the events to come, 
Fox decided to start with the second 
episode, “The Train Job,” a fast paced 
gold-heist episode that was undoubt-
edly exciting, but ultimately off-put-
ting for first-time viewers who were 
just plain confused by Whedon’s ragtag 
gang of smugglers. Without the back-
ground of the first episode, the show 
lacked the heart that is currently keep-
ing Browncoats attending “Firefly” 
screenings and conventions. Worst of 
all, “Firefly” was given a time slot on 
Friday night, and coupled with the fact 
that Fox chose to air several episodes 
out of order, it’s no wonder that the 
show became a one-season wonder.

“Firefly” finally got a second 
chance this past March, courtesy of the 
Science Channel. The hallowed series 
was aired in Whedon’s intended order, 
one episode a week, and the series is 
nearing its close — again. In many 
ways, rewatching “Firefly” now is a 
sort of atonement for not caring when 
it first aired (and mattered). Looking 
back on it, it’s not difficult to see why 
there was so much bitterness over its 
cancellation. 

In the end, the show isn’t just about 
smuggling and robbery in a new space 
frontier. It’s about the group of out-
casts who are doing it — battle-scarred 
veterans, mercenaries, runaways, a 
preacher and a respected, official pros-
titute — facing the grim existence of 
the universe (dubbed the ‘Verse’ in the 
show) and doing their best to survive. 
In watching the show, you are sucked 
into their pseudo-family and their 
strange world of criminal activity and 
blustering derring-do.

theatre CompanY brings stuDent 
iDeas to liFe by rebecca limerick 

i t could be a Swiss area code for all you know, but the number 157 holds a spe-cial resonance within Galbraith Hall. The digits refer to room 157, the meet-
ing place and namesake for Company 157, a 
student organization that serves as a produc-
tion company and a liaison between students 
and the theatre department. Their latest proj-
ect, the Underground New Play Festival, aims 
to promote this on-campus collaboration on a 
larger scale, serving as a network for student 
actors, directors, playwrights and technicians.

But the company’s valuable resources have 
gone predominantly untapped.  

“We are stuck in Revelle, desperately try-
ing to reach north,” the company’s managing 
director Justin O’Neill said. “Once you pass 
Mandeville, no one knows we exist.” 

Company 157 provides UCSD’s burgeon-
ing artists with the money, venues, props, cos-

tumes and staff to turn their lofty visions into 
elaborate realities. 

“My job is to say ‘no’ as little as possible,” 
O’Neill said.

Five years ago, undergraduate theatre stu-
dents Kendra Miller and Matt Barrs founded 
the organization as an outlet to select their 
own plays for production — ones that the the-
atre department wouldn’t put on. And though 
the original intentions were initially more self-
serving, it was this spirit of artistic outreach 
that laid the foundations of faculty and gradu-
ate student cooperation.

One of Company 157’s aims is to bridge 
UCSD’s undergraduate theatre and dance pro-
grams with its top-ranked graduate programs, 
supplying undergraduates with a wider spec-
trum of opportunities and focused help. 

Company 157 holds workshops open to all 
students, led by professionals knowledgeable 

in the fields of stage make-up, improvisation 
and auditioning. The fourteen current board 
members, selected through an application 
and interview process, meet twice a week, but 
dedicate a far larger portion of their lives to 
procuring personal connections with under-
graduate theatre department faculty, graduate 
students, as well as industry professionals.  

This year, Company 157 financed and sup-
ported the Shakespeare production “Much 
Ado About Nothing,” the visual arts and 
theatre collaborative piece “Radical Acts of 
Desire” and “Howl,” a Halloween art exhibit 
featuring acapella, improvisation, performance 
and visual art — though most UCSD students 
wouldn’t be able to tell you that. 

Last school year, they focused their spring 
quarter energy and funds on Our New Play

San Diego’s Fighting With 
Irons brings seabound jams 

to landlocked scene. 
By Naomi Sweo •

Senior Staff Writer

T he folk-rock troubadours of Fighting With Irons met in a San Diego musical youth production of “Peter Pan” as singing pirates. Two years later, that 
same swashbuckling sentiment shadows with Sunset 
Cliffs — the band’s debut EP set for release on May 27. 
The album is chock-full of nautical influences, from the 
band’s name to its breezy acoustic sound and sea-chanty 
lyricism. 

“The man sat down beside her/The man used tools 
and rope to guide her/Back home on the deep blue sea,” 
vocalists Paul Gillcrist and Sarah De La Isla croon on 
standout “And They Sailed.” Tinkling cymbals back uku-
lele, keyboard, guitar, bass, violin and the winsome dual 
harmonies, managing lively charm without sounding 
gimmicky or overwhelming. They’ve even explored the 
untapped potential of the humble conch.

“We were in a band rehearsal and [bass player] 
Samuel [Narveson] had to go to the bathroom,” Gillcrist 
recently told the Guardian. “When he came out of the 
bathroom, he came out with a conch shell in his hand

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 26, 2011 HIATUS

I t’s safe to say that if you liked “The Hangover” you will like “The Hangover Part II;” after all, it is more or less the same exact film.
Director Todd Phillips hasn’t tried very 

hard to veer from the original’s high-grossing 
formula: Best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), 
Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), along 
with bearded outsider Alan (Zach Galifianakis), 
get together on the eve of a wedding, only to 
wake up the next morning in a trashed hotel 

room with no recollec-
tion of the hijinks of the 
previous night (though 
they are left with plenty of 
sordid clues, including a 
severed finger, a monkey 
and a facial tattoo). The 
only difference is that the 

groom-to-be is straight-laced dentist Stu, and 
the setting has been moved from Las Vegas to 

the more scenic Thailand.
Various other plot elements remain: There’s 

the opening phone call to a distressed bride, 
followed by a flashback to what led to the drink-
that-started-it-all; there’s a quest to find a miss-
ing friend, whose ultimate location isn’t as dire 
as “The Wolfpack” initially feared; and there are 
deals-gone-wrong with various crime lords. 

But even with a plot line that’s inherently 
unoriginal, “The Hangover Part II” still man-

ages plenty of laughs, particularly in the begin-
ning, before the film goes the over-the-top 
action-comedy route and starts to lose steam. 
Problem is, we’ve seen these guys screaming 
at each other in the midst of car chases before 
— the second time around, the laughs don’t hit 
nearly as hard.

Admittedly, Phillips tries to give the movie 
some spark, filming it more like an action 
movie than a buddy-comedy. He does well with 
the foreign location, using slick cinematography 
to capture the grit of Bangkok. As Kanye West’s 
“Monster” pounds over aerial shots of the coun-
try, it hardly feels like the raunchy comedy the 
“R” rating promises it will be.

The actors jump into their old roles 
well, though like he did in the original film, 
Galifianakis steals the show with his brand of 
so-awkward-it-hurts humor. Cooper is mostly 
disposable and Helms certainly tries hard: The 
actor squeals like a girl with a grimace-inducing 
commitment, playing the character so unhinged 
that you don’t even bother to pity him.  

The comedy relies a lot more on shock value 
than straight-up jokes — a questionable choice, 
considering the least-raunchy scenes ended up 
being the funniest. Galifianakis’ Alan show-
ing his “three best friends” around his room, 
ordering his mother to bring him dessert over 
a P.A. system and explaining his role as a “stay-
at-home son” — all before the guys even hop on 
the plane to Asia —  is far more hilarious than 
the chicks-with-dicks (seriously) detour the film 
ultimately takes.

Phil Elverum is likely the most accomplished indie 
legend you’ve never heard of. His initial musical 
brainchild/collaborative the Microphones influenced 
a generation of experimental indie rock and 
lo-fi bands with billowing guitar fuzz and pages 
of poetic lyrics. Elverum’s most recent project 
Mount Eerie has garnered equal critical praise, 
mounting Elverum’s yearning vocals and stream-
of-consciousness songwriting atop more subdued, 
acoustic instrumentals. Label mates Key Losers 
and Nick Krgovich are set to open. (RE)

HIATUS THURSDAY, MAY 26, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9

F ervent garage god and Sonic Youth founder Thurston Moore 
gives us a glimpse of his 
softer side on Demolished 
Thoughts — his first 
solo album in four years. 
Produced by alt-rock icon 
Beck, the album chronicles 
Moore’s transition into 
sweeping acoustic instru-
mentation — delivering 
just enough attitude for 
hardcore Sonic Youth fans, 
with plenty of thoughtful 
delicacy for the decidedly 
folk-minded.  

But for Moore, “softer” 
does not mean “smaller.” 
Inflated by Beck’s airy 
production, Demolished 
Thoughts flows along in an 
array of layered chords and 
somber orchestral flourishes 
reminiscent of Nick Drake 
circa 1972.  And though this 
is the product of a renowned 
guitarist striking out on his 
own, Thurston Moore isn’t 
out to boast about his guitar 
chops. As exhibited in his 
previous work, Moore’s style 
often relies on building tex-
ture rather than meticulous 
guitar solos.    

“Circulation” finds 
Moore truest to his indie-
punk roots. The track’s 
sharp guitar jabs, booming 
chorus and angst-ridden 
lyrics (“she’s not here to 
stay, she just came by to 

shoot you baby”) sound as if 
they’ve been plucked from 
any of Moore’s pre-millenni-
al thrashers. Opening track, 
“Benediction”, is another 
instant classic — sweeping 
string arrangements, spa-
cious guitar strums and a 
triumphant chorus are built 
up to reveal Moore’s irresist-
ibly sentimental alter-ego.  

Yet Demolished Thoughts 
is ultimately top-heavy with 
stand-out tracks, leaving 
the latter half frustratingly 
unremarkable in compari-
son. The hectic, deafening 
build of the two-and-a-half-
minute “Orchard Street” 
drags aimlessly toward the 
dreary, hymn-sounding 
“Mina Loy.” The atmo-
spheric guitar noodling on 
“Space” and “January” closes 
out the album pleasantly, 
but Moore’s insistence on 
concealing any trace of emo-
tion dampens the lingering 
momentum of Demolished 
Thoughts’ first exceptional 
songs.

But Thurston Moore 
deserves some credit for 
stepping out of his com-
fort zone, and Demolished 
Thoughts offers enough 
memorable moments to 
reaffirm the significance 
of one of indie rock’s living 
legends.

aLBuMREVIEW

and he just started blowing.”
With seven members and 

upwards of 18 instruments, it’s diffi-
cult to imagine Fighting With Irons 
fitting on stage. During their March 
9 show at Porter’s Pub, they man-
aged an additional three members 
for a total of ten performers, oddball 
instruments in hand. They ended 
the night with a saxophone jam 
session, a hand-and-body percus-
sive performance, and (naturally) 
a conch shell solo. Crowd partici-
pation was at a startling high; the 
entire audience clapped and sang 
along, and even the pub owner 
joined in. 

But while the space was crowded, 
the music was hardly overwhelm-
ing. Gillcrist’s simple lyrics and the 
expert, non-intrusive employment 
of instrumentals keep Fighting With 
Irons’ sound refreshingly mellow.

Though they each have a long 
history of musical education — both 
vocalist/keyboardist De La Isla’s 
parents are musicians, while bassist 
Andy Walsh is set to attend music 
school in the fall — their ages range 
from a youthful 15 to 20. Not sur-
prisingly, given his evident penchant 
for swashbuckling theatrics, fresh-
man Gillcrist is a fencer at UCSD 
and teaches sailing classes at Mission 
Bay Sports Center during the sum-
mer. Though he is in college himself, 
he has an appreciation for younger 
crowds, thanks to his band mates.

“I’m open to the idea of playing 
at coffee shops and trying to get 
people that are in high school able 
to go to shows,” Gillcrist said. “Most 
of the bands in our genre play at 
bars or places that are over 21.”

“Tell me about it,” De La Isla 
added. Though she’s only sixteen, 
De La Isla recently tested out of high 
school in order to focus on film and 
music.

Intimate spaces, like Porter’s Pub 

and a slew of local coffee shops, 
seem to create the ideal environ-
ment for Fighting With Irons’ 
brand of indie rock. It’s the direct 
relationship, and even collabora-
tion, between the audience and the 
musicians that have gained them 
an increasing amount of followers. 
And despite their many members 
and cluttered arsenal of instruments, 
what the group truly strives for is 
simple: creating a fun experience for 
the crowd by having fun themselves. 
That sentiment remains on the 
Fighting With Irons’ debut. 

“When people back in the day 
would buy an album, they’d buy 
it and listen to the entire thing… 
The way I’ve written the EP, the five 
songs, is a storyline,” Gillcrist said. 
“It’s a concept album, a concept 
EP. I would describe it as a journey 
of finding yourself or of having a 
second chance. ‘Sunset Cliffs’ is a 
song about suicide and drowning 
in the sea, and for whatever reason, 
the main protagonist has a second 
chance and is able to find a boat in 
‘And They Sailed’ and repair it.” 

But despite their ambitious nar-
ratives, Fighting With Irons are sat-
isfied with the simple experience of 
playing their music for a live audi-
ence, or reaching someone through 
their jubilantly recorded material.

“There’s no goal of trying to 
make it big or get any financial 
outcome of it,” Gillcrist said. “When 
we’re going on seven people in our 
band, there’s no way you’re going to 
make it financially on the small-time 
level. It’s not about the money, it’s 
not about success — it’s about play-
ing the music.”

Their EP release show is Friday, 
May 27 at the Pacific Beach Women’s 
Club at 7:30 p.m. Entrance (including 
a copy of the EP) is $10. Sunset Cliffs 
will also become available the night 
of the release show on their website, 
http://www.fightingwithirons.com.

Spectacular — an entirely student-organized theatri-
cal showcase. Not only were the actors, directors and 
technicians all undergraduate students of various 
majors, but the plays were also student-written.  

This year, the festival has been renamed the 
Underground New Play Festival — a change emblem-
atic of a new company tradition: For the first time 
ever, the spring undergraduate play festival has 
become an official department show. 

“The department believed in the students enough 
to put their name on it,” co-chair Bianna Hill said. 
“We are still doing our jobs, just with more support; 
we are now being trusted with the infrastructural 
responsibilities.”

In Winter Quarter, Company 157 called upon 
budding playwrights to submit their tellable tales. The 
group received 35 scripts, narrowing them down to 
the eight plays that will be showcased through June 
4 in the Arthur Wagner Theatre. Directors were then 
interviewed and chosen by the Company board mem-
bers, and those given the opportunity to lead commit-
ted themselves to a quarter’s worth of casting, rehears-
ing with and inspiring a small group of actors. 

This year UNPF is operating on its largest scale yet, 
with upwards of 80 undergraduates involved in vary-
ing aspects of the creative and production processes.   

The eight plays are being split into two showcases 
(A & B), promising to explore the hallucinations of 
Goldilocks, utter memory loss and the fateful deci-
sions that accompany drinking tomato juice.  

“Butterfly in China,” directed by Sean Estelle and 
written by Lexi Saunders, is a complex meditation on 
the echoing repercussions of a single choice. The play 
follows two separate yet intersecting stories — one of 
a college professor lecturing on the chaos theory, and 
another of two strangers who meet at a bus stop.

Karen Li’s “Surprise in Sea Sharp” (directed by 
Claire Kaplan) is a surreal comedy set 20,000 feet in 
the air. The passengers of a commercial airliner learn 
the importance and limitations of human compassion 
with the help of complimentary beverages, the mile-
high club and a few very important camels.

O’Neill challenges the creative souls of UCSD to 
come forward with even more fresh ideas just waiting 
to be endorsed. 

“We’d like to see found space theatre,” O’Neill said. 
“We want daring non-standard thinking.”

USA National qualifier (the equiva-
lent to qualifying for the Olympic 
Trials), she is poised to take three 
more top eight finishes, going into 
this weekend’s national meet ranked 
No. 3 in the 100 meters, No. 4 in the 
200 meters and — as a member of 
the team with juniors Jackie Rose, 
Deyna Roberson, Caitlin Meagher 
and freshman Lauren Irish — ranked 
No. 9 in the 4 x 400 relay. 

I cornered her on the seemingly 
endless bus ride from San Diego to 
Turlock, where this year’s NCAA 
Division II Outdoor Track & Field 
National Championship Meet is cur-
rently being held on the campus of 
Cal State Stanislaus.

As the trees started to whisk by, I 
asked what made her get into sports 
in the first place.

“Well, I really can’t remember 
a singular moment,” she said. “I’ve 
been playing sports since I can 
remember. It was kind of an evo-
lution of just wanting to compete 
and have fun. I started with soccer 
when I was young, basically since I 
can remember with under 6’s and I 
played everything from softball to 
basketball to actually being a cheer-
leader in high school.”

The thought of Fogarty as a 
cheerleader totally threw me for a 
loop as I imagined her running down 
the opposing mascot in a skirt and 
beating its paper mâché head in.

Snapping back from my reverie, I 
asked her when it clicked that track 
was the sport for her. 

“I was really good at soccer,” she 
said. “I started as a defender but 
moved to forward when I out-ran 
everyone at practice. From there they 
would basically just kick it over the 
defenders so I could chase it and 
shoot — and mostly miss. But I 
was pretty much always able to stay 
onside and beat the defenders to the 

through ball. From there I went into 
high school knowing I was fast, but 
not quite how fast I really was.”

She stopped there, modestly 
unwilling to reveal her time until I 
could coax it out of her. 

“A 13.01,” she said. “My coach was 
really happy, kind of standing there 
with his mouth open.”

That’s incredibly fast for a fresh-
man in high school. From that 
point on, Fogarty only 
improved, thanks in 
part to her supportive 
family.

Her father is retired 
and “around 70,” she 
said. “[So he has] noth-
ing to do but come 
watch meets.” 

Her mother is a 
teacher, and is usually 
able to get off work to 
attend. Throughout her 
life her parents have 
been there for her. 
When asked if it affect-
ed her much that they 
were older than many of 
her friends’ parents, she 
admitted that she could 
never really play sports 
with her father — an 
aspect of childhood she 
consequently missed out on. But his 
support and close proximity at all 
times more than made up for it. 

Even though the rest of her family 
isn’t particularly athletic, Fogarty has 
had the drive to set goals and com-
plete them her whole life. 

Going into her senior year in high 
school, she had applied to several 
colleges, with UCLA and Berkeley 
as her top choices. For Fogarty, the 
admission decisions came in the 
middle of a track meet. She was get-
ting warmed up for a race when her 
phone rang, and her Dad told her she 
had not gotten into either college, 
but that she had gotten into her third 

choice, UCSD.
There was no time to ask why and 

no time to think about it, as her event 
was called over the loud speaker and 
she had to get into her blocks. After 
learning the news, she ran the fastest 
200m time in her high school career 
— an astonishing 24.5 seconds.

This was perhaps the start of 
her college career. Neither of the 
Division I schools she failed to get 

into were pursuing her 
for track, but UCSD 
was interested. Darcy 
Ahner, head coach of 
the UCSD women’s 
team, and Mick Geiskes, 
the sprint coach, want-
ed her on the team. At 
the time, the team was 
the defending confer-
ence champion, and 
had some of the greatest 
female athletes to step 
foot on our track — 
such as nine-time All-
American Laiah Blue, 
school record holder in 
the 100-high hurdles, 
and National Champion 
and All-American 
Christine Merrill.

The UCSD women’s 
program was at its peak, 

with up-and-coming heavy hitters 
(at that time juniors and seniors), 
three-time CCAA Champs and, with 
the help of Fogarty, two more titles. 
Additionally, in her junior year she 
helped the women’s team to its high-
est-ever placing, the No. 3 team in all 
of Division II.

I asked her how she felt as one of 
the pillars that success has been built 
on in the past few years.

“Well, when you compare me 
to a Laiah, who has so many All-
Americans, and Christine — who is 
living the dream competing on the 
international elite level — I would 
like to be thought of as their equals,” 

Fogarty said. “It is a bit daunting to 
think about trying to catch them, but 
here I am on the bus to where I can 
make it happen.”

Fogarty is the school record hold-
er in the 100 and 200 meters, and 
bettered her records in competition 
this year. Ever humble, she specu-
lated on her future in a subdued, 
quiet voice.

“I mean, if I don’t run a USA time 
at NCAA’s, I’m planning to run at a 
meet on June 4 to get the time and 
go to Oregon for the USATF,” she 
said. “Then next year, I would love to 
come back and be an assistant coach 
while I work to get into med school. 
That way I could stay in shape and 
try for a shot at the Olympic Trials. 
If I don’t make it after that I really 
can’t see staying competitive; its just 
such a big time commitment and 
I’m going to be super busy with med 
school.”

Planning to go into gynecolo-
gy or sports medicine, Fogarty has 
not only achieved athletic prowess, 
but also scholastic success. As is the 
modus operandi of UCSD athletes 
across the board, she feels that sports 
helps with time management and 
with providing her a reason not to 
goof off; after all, there isn’t any time 
for it.

I asked Fogarty what she thought 
of the move to Division I. As many 
athletes are, she is concerned but 
excited about the move.

“It’s scary because you have to 
worry about your sport getting 
cut for funding in the scholarship 
department, and how successful the 
team is going to be in the future,” 
she said. 

As the embodiment of the height 
of what UCSD is at the Division 
II level, Fogarty is a key figure in 
our history as a program. At UCLA, 
she would not have been given the 
chance to run, and there is a danger 
in denying some who would rather 

be in a Division II situation.
“It would increase our name as 

a commodity, make us a big deal,” 
she said. 

Fogarty is sure the department 
will carry out the move the right 
way, allowing for the winning equa-
tion for her team. Always a fighter, 
Fogarty loves her team and wants to 
see it succeed in the future. 

“The girls coming in are good,” 
she said. “There is a good dynamic 
right now in the team that makes it 
kind of different than when I came 
in, but still ripe for success at confer-
ence and nationals.”

Times have certainly changed for 
Fogarty since she first showed up at 
UCSD: The introverted freshman she 
once was has become the gregarious, 
talkative leader she is now.

On the track in every race, she 
comes alive with a fire that is always 
burning just below the surface. When 
the gun goes up and goes off, the line 
of muscles erupts and pounds its way 
down the track as 16 legs come alive. 

Then there is this click. In an 
instant Kelly Fogarty turns into 
something I can only describe as 
Rambo-like as she mows down her 
competition. 

Fogarty gets that click, that 
moment of decision in her eyes. 
When she strides out in front of the 
competition with her great Popeye 
biceps, she makes all of her competi-
tion look slow. 

Kelly Fogarty is truly the epitome 
of what it means to be a UCSD 
athlete, a competitor and a superb 
friend. She can win while still being 
beautiful and brilliant. She can 
intimidate everyone yet make friends 
with anyone. She is one of the great-
est that has ever walked our campus 
and I have been honored to be her 
teammate and her friend.

SOFTBALL — No. 16 UCSD Softball is headed 
to Salem, Va. to face off against No. 25 C.W. Post 
in the first leg of the Division II College World 
Series on Thursday, May 26 at 9 a.m. 

C.W. Post University, located in Brookville, 
N.Y., qualified as the winner of the East Region 
with a 41-14 record. The Pioneers emerged 

from regular season play third in the confer-
ence standings, but battled their way through 
the national regionals to claim a spot in the 
college world series. Although the Pioneers are 
without a national title, Post certainly has the 
edge over UCSD in terms of experience in the 
postseason. The Pioneers have advanced to the 
NCAA regionals every year since 2002 and were 
crowned the East Region Champions in both 
the 2007 and 2008 seasons.

In contrast, the Tritons began their season 
as dark horse contenders, picked to finish fifth 
in the CCAA by a survey taken by the confer-
ence’s coaches at the start of the season. But the 
Tritons shook up the conference after finishing 
as CCAA regular season champions and final-
ists in the conference tournament. With very 

little experience at the national level, the Tritons 
have only qualified for Regionals four times in 
the past nine years, making early exits in all 
occasions. The Tritons will be making their first 
ever appearance at the college world series.

But this year’s squad promises to give peren-
nial powerhouse Post a run for its money. The 
Tritons boast arguably the best pitcher in the 
nation in junior Camille Gaito (31-4). Gaito 
has a .66 ERA (the second lowest in the nation), 
holds the school record for most wins in a 
season and was named to the Division II All-
Region First Team. Gaito has pitched in every 
inning since the start of the NCAA tournament, 
and has struck out 32 batters in 39 innings.

But Gaito will have her work cut out for 
her against the Pioneers’ Nicole Hagenah. The 

freshman is batting .465 and has knocked in 60 
runs on 72 hits for a slugging percentage of .787. 

If there’s one thing the Tritons have going for 
them, it’s manufacturing seventh inning runs. 
UCSD has won four of its past five NCAA tour-
nament games in its final turn at the plate, and 
it’s likely the trend will continue into the double 
elimination national tournament. 

The winner of the matchup will face the 
winner of the game between Saginaw Valley 
and Minnesota State-Mankato, to be played 
on Friday, May 27 at 1 p.m. The loser will be 
relegated to the loser’s bracket for a game on 
Saturday, May 28 at 9 a.m.

Kelly Fogarty, the fastest 
woman in UCSD history, is 
set for her last collegiate race 
at nationals this weekend.

The first day of track practice freshman year, I saw an army of perfect female legs loping its way around the track and knew this was 
where I wanted to spend my free time at UCSD. 
Walking down the cement stairs, I was honestly 
intimidated by these women more than I was by the 
male athletes on the team. Sure, they were strong, but 
the girls were also beautiful. 

Then leading the pack down the front strait, I 
saw a girl coming towards me that made me feel 
like a lesser man. Not only were her legs amazing, 
but her biceps were bigger than every other guy’s on 
the team, excluding our 350-pound shot putter, Fred 
Cook. But unlike Fred, Kelly Fogarty is a beautiful 
blonde girl from Danville, Calif. 

I found out during the year that, not only were 
her biceps huge, but they gave her some magic power 
to beat other girls in any race she decided to enter. 
She has finished in the top eight at NCAA Nationals 
an amazing four times in her career, making her an 
All-American four times over.

And she is not finished. Having come near to a
