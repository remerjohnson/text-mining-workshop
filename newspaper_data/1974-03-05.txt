CONSIDERATION

LA JOLLA, CAL li 
454-1970 

Lindy Parks , an fONA employee, said that students 
have not used the list much yet, probably due to a lack 
of publiCity about it . 

The idea for the project was conceived by Bookman 
and George Murphy, Vice Chancellor for Student Af-
fairs, after they had several inquiries from students on 
how to arrange carpools. They obtained the information 
and student permission to use it from the information 
cards students receive every quarter in their registration 
packets. 

This was a cost-free service, said Bookman as the 
university already had the information and the 
regi tration office donated the printout. 

Bookman stated that any students who have ad-
ditional ideas about organizing carpool s or servi ces the 
Student Center can provide, can contact him at ex-
tension 2943 .

OPINION 
MINORITY EDITORIAL 

The following editorial is supported by a majority of 
those memben of the Triton Times Editorial Board who , 
feel competent to express an opinion on this issue, but 
not a majority of the Editorial Board as a whole. 

Vote Today 
There are many elections in which the issues are 

confused, the candidates indistinguishable, and the 
prospects hopeless . The Del Mar City Counci l election 
being held today is not one of these. 

One really need do little more than read the official 
"Statements of Qualification" to obtain a fair estimate 
of the relative merits of the candidates, 

Mayor janice Heinzmann : " In order to conserve and 
enhance our community's va luable natural assets and to 
preserve the quality of life we all enjoy, it is increasingly 
important for us to work together . I firmly believe that 
local government will prove able to meet the serious 
challenges of the next few years . I pledge my efforts to 
continue to work for increased cit izen participation In 
government; for more positive plannin g with more 
creative implementation of that planning; and to 
provide the responsible and responsive service I have 
tried to give dur ing the past 8 years ." 

It is ironic that anyone cou ld call for "increased 
citizen participation" while lulli ng the citizens into 
utter impotence with such rhetorical tripe . A further 
example : an elegantly designed piece of Heinzmann 
campaign literature features as its sole legend the 
comment of some uncited sage : "A Vote for Heinzmann 
IS a Vote for Fair and Responsible Government ." 

Bob Westerwi ck : " I feel that my primary qualification 
for City Counci lman is my ability to analyze and solve 
problems using sound, logical approaches. My work for 
20 year has been to analyze time dependent systems 
and these methods are now being applied to economic 
systems. As an engineering supervisor I am very sen-
itive to both time and budgetary constraints, Del Mar 

can benefit from this experience." 
One gets the impression from this that he believes , 

and expects us to believe, that somewhere there exists a 
golden tab let inscribed with the true, immutable goal , 
and that all one needs to do is to use soun.d logic to 
reach it As if there were not irreconcilable conflicts of 
interest invo lved that require an emotional com-
mitment one way or the other . 

He concludes by citing his experience as a Scout-
master, his love for the outdoors, and his willingness "to 
listen to both sides of a discussion ," 

If a politician is afraid to make his true tendencies 
public, his best escape is "apple" rhetoric, such as the 
above , But john Weare and Nancy Hoover are both very 
blatant in their advocacy of intel l igible positions , 

They cite the following goals: 
" Protect the vi llage atmosphere , 
Check the trend toward large dense condominiums 

through fair and sound growth ontrol legislation . 
Preserve open space by effective open space 

requirements on developments . 
Encourage a quality business community consistent 

with the residential character of Del Mar. 
Keep Del Mar financially sound by careful fiscal 

management. 
I mprove the quality of life with cultural opportunities 

and the feeling of co mmun ity ." 
jan Heinzmann, a council incumbent, has repeatedly 

voted to allow the construction of luxury con-
dominiums in Del Mar, 'Whi ch greatly increase the 
residential density and are quite profitable for their 
developers . Since Westerwick has the support of many 
Heinzmann partisans, it is fair to assume that he would 
have Similar tendencies . 

What people like Weare and Hoover are saying is that 
big money does not have a God-given right to shape the 
world according to its own se lfish whims, There is 
precedent for such dominance; and precedent generally 
forms the notions of "fairness and responsibility" held 
by average minds , Thus some of our candidates believe 
that we must be " responsible", " look at both sides", "be 
logical ", "seek compromise"; in which case it would be 
only a matter of time before Del Mar was a carbon copy 
of downtown La jolla . 

Del Mar can retain its unique village-like en-
vironment, but only if its citizens are continually 
vigilant in demanding that their true interests be served. 
Remember that once an area is "developed", the step is 
irrevocable. 

If Weare and Hoover are elected, the Del Mar City 
Council will have a firm majority who are explicitly 
committed to saving Del Mar . Students make up almost 
20 percent of the registered voters in Del Mar. In the last 
Del Mar Council election, Tom Shepard, a former UCSD 
Student Body President, was elected with student 
support . Here is an issue where you can really make a 
difference. 

We, the following Editors of the Triton Times strongly 
urge all students registered in Del Mar to vote today; 
and enthusiastically recommends that those votes be 
cast for John Weare and Nancy Hoover

Let's Make Sense,' 
Not Slogans 

by Mayor Jan Heinzmann 

Since 1964, long before some of my political op-
ponents even knew that Del Mar existed, I have been 
working for the ... "preservation and enhancement of 
Del Mar's natural assets" . As a member of the com-
munity and City Council I havp worked for 

' Th,e Torrey Pines Park Extension 
' The Sign Board Ordinance, limiting the size of signs 
' The Flood Plain Ordinance, protecting the San 

Dieguito Lagoon 
'The creation of a City Planning Department 
'Ordinances reducing the density in R-3 zones 
'The Tree Ordinance to protect the Torrey Pines 
'Ordinances lim iting lot coverage and building height 
'The establishment of Sea Grove Park at the foot of 

15th. St . 
'The Resolution opposing Carmel Valley Airport 
'Resolutions supporting the Torrey Pines Wild Life 
'Association 's efforts to curtail development near the 

state park 
'The Coastline In itiative 
'Establishment of the f irst General Plan, b.:lSed on 

citizen input. 

These goals have been achieved without my <:reating 
any political pressure groups, for Del Mar is an unusual 
community . Our citizens historically have been con-
cerned about the environment; and our desire to 
protect our village atmosphere has been shared by al.\ 
residents : students, retired people, renters, and home 
owners . 

It has appeared to me that since 1%8 (when our 
General Plan was first adopted) that our community 
attitude toward land use have been changing 
gradually . One of the symptoms of this change is that 
some building projects which were unanimously ap-
proved by the City Council and which met no com-
munity opposition-not even by my respected op-
ponents-are only now being opposed . However, rather 
than using this opposition for se lf-serving political 
purposes , I worked for the estab li shment of citizens' 
committees to update the goals of the General Plan , 
This way we can be sure that the new rules regarding 
land use will have broad-based community support. 

As we all know, most solutions to today's problems 
are not simple While I should like to win votes with 
simple, catchy slogans , today's voters want and deserve 
to know more , Del Mar should be what the ci tizens 
want it to be, not just what I want it to be, I am an 
elected representative of \ill the citizens; I am not an 
annointed monarch. 

For a small town we have been able to achieve a great 
deal. But there are still many problems to be so lved . For 

e~ample, I have helped to make the Coast Cruiser a 
reality, but I st ill ee that many people have to hitch 
hike or have to fight heavy traffic on bikes, A public 
transpbrtation system and sa fe bike paths are necessary. 
We also need to re-<fesign Camino del Mar to make it 
accommodate increased bicycle and pedestrian traffic. 
We need to olve the beach erosion problem on a 
regional level. We need an open-space program we can 
all support and afford . 

I pledge my efforts to solve these problems by ob-
taining as much information as possible and by con-
ti nu ing to be available to hear all citizens and to weigh 
all poi nts of view. I further pledge myself to ' continue to 
make decisions based on the nature of the problem and 
not on my personal prejudices. We do have serious 
challenges facing us, but given the physical and human 
re ources of Del Mar I know we can succeed in meeting 
them .

A LEGENDARY PEIFORMER . Elvis, Volume I, 

flCA CPL1 -0341 

"Clowing With an . enerl:Y which transcends time, 
these are performances which will recall fond memories 
for collectors, and bring the joy of new discovery to 
young audiences." (Reprinted from the liner notes 
Elvil, Volume I.) , 

As a purely simplistic ~ynopsis, Elvis, Volume I doe 
succeed in touching all the fundamental bases of the 
artist's colorful, two-<lecade long, multi-<limensional 
recording career. Each facet, i.e. of rock 'n' roller, love 
balladeer, piritual singer and cabaret-style film star , is 
represented and tied together in a c irca 1954-61 
chronology of twelve songs and two interviews 

Seen a no more than a basic career outline, the 
package works and works well. In tbis context, songs 
and interview segments have been tastefully assembled 
and edited using only high quality masters. The choice 
of the material itself must likewise be conSidered 
"appropriate" when viewed in terms of an outline 
structure. 

Problems and weaknesses begin to arise though when 
evaluating the album as omething more thim this 
"basic" outline. I think as an introduction to this 
founding father of rock and roll , the album is totally 
ineHective and doesn't serve, as it could have, to "bring 
the joy of new discovery to ¥oung audiences". 

The relevance of Elvis Presley to the evolution of rock 
and for contemporary " young audiences" lies in his 
mannerisms and charisma framed by his rock song and 
not by the syrupy ballads whi ch make up the majority of 
Elvis, Volume I . Says Elvis in side one's brief interview, 
" Rock and roll music, if you like it and if you feel it , you 
can't help but move to it .. that's what happens to me. 
1 ... 1 can't help il.. .. 1 have to move around .... 1 can't stand 
st i ll .... I've tried it but I can't do it" And isn't that the 
facet of Elvis' aura which people remember best? It 
made him different. It earned him the ti tle "King of rock 
and roll " There, on the coast-to-{;oast family-oriented 
Ed Sullivan Show, was Elvis, emitting his visual, 
gyrating, hip-shaking, rebel Without a cause defiance of 
traditional norl)1S of stage pre ence and performanc 
He dared to be different and the public responded with 
a buying power eventually capab le of making hi 
record outsel l those of any other artist in recording 
industry history, a dl tinction inCidentally, which stili 
~tands. 

Well those rockers which really captured th iS 
Visua lly uninhibited aura are sorely lacki ng here. Of the 
album's twelve selections, just four qualify as outright 
rock and roll songs, and of these, "Thai's All Right" , 
"Heartbreak Hotel" and " Don'l Be Cruel" come off 
particularly effective and exciting in a contemporary 
sense. The remaining material is comprised of one 
piritual , "Peace in the Valley", and a handful of dated 

ballads including "Love Me Tender" and "Can't Help 
F ailing in Love" 

As far as " reca lling fond memories for co llectors", the 
album succeeds only at a boob-tube level of simplistic 
nostalgia . Any memories revived by (questionable) 
"icities like "Are You Lonesome TonighU", or "Love 
Me" will be in the "t hey're playing our song", 
houseWives-soap opera context. 

Elvis, Volume I, in summary, is a worthwhi Ie buy onl y 
as an elementary outline of a complex period in a multi-
talented artists career It ' ~ primary weakness is in its 
attempt to encompass the essense of a diverse highly 
productive talent in the length of one LP If the sub-
sequent Volume II retraces the 50's adequately, perhaps 
it will prove a sufficient supplem ent But if Volume II 
conti nues the already establi shed chronology and 
begins in 1961 , all we can E'xpect are formula songs from 
those 26 - 28 formula Elvis-meets·girl fi Ims. An album 
like that would have all the aesthetic value of an LP of 
Annette and Frankie Singing Beach Party hits and 
deservE' the masochists sea l of approval.

"A potpourri of Children 's

romp through im -
provi sation and stylized 
a ting. The show, directed 
by Bennett E. MClellan, 
has as its central pi ece a 
playl et titled , " The 
Thinger 's Machine". The 
playlet weaves an cology 
theme into a story about a 
very unusual machin that 
can do anything, or rather 
almost anything, and four 
people who run into 
problems because they are 
careless with their lise of 
th machine . A song ailed 
the " Pond Song" opens the 
show by getting both th 
actors and the audience 
involved in singing the 
songs of various pond 
animals, like ducks and 
frogs . In another segment of 
the show, the player take 
suggest ions from the 
audience for machines the 
audience would like to see.

No Exit Larry Deckel 
Well. speaking of hell , which happens to be the locale 
Sartre's No b it, they say the road there is paved with 

intentions. Well, no one could question the 
good intentions, with the incredibly ambitious 

exciting selection of important theatre works which 
the Globe/Carter stages this year, including The 

Opera, Ceremonies in 0 .. "" Old Men, 
and less performed works by important 

such as Arthur Miller [The Price], Tennessee 
lIiams [Summer .. nd Smoke], and Mol iere [Tartuffe] . 
However, 'tween the intention and the actual delivery 
the product , the Clobe has seen a year which has 

en and shivered a bit under the weight of the 
load, and where crowd pleasing situation 

rnrr,pniies would be the easy way out, the Clobe has 
trave lling on the road less travelled and stumbles a 

and there as it blazes its path to presenting a 
quality theatrical experience in San Diego. 
now coming down the road is the Carter's 

of No hit under the direction of Asaad 
a, and speaking of good intentions, I've never 

such a well-intentioned show. Kelada's direction is 
clear, and'to the point. The pace of the show is 

and always moving, I;arefullv avoiding the ten-
to get lost in the prosey text of a play which 

has no real plot, no rea l sense of action . His use 
space and blocking is economical and imaginative. 

The set designed by Scott Busath and Kelada's use of 
speak highly of this sharpness . The combination of 

elements make the opening moments of the play 
The stage lights come harsh ly up on the bare 

metrical i nteriorof aroom.5udden ly, at the top of the 
an elevator door opens sharply allowing a harsh 
light to permeate the stage, while the om-

hum of machinery comes from the depths 
Garcin , amply portrayed by Michael Smith, is 
in by bellboy Paul Perkins, and carefully sur-

hiS new residence . Smith's diction is tight, precise, 
leaps over the prose with the greatest of ease. He is 
by the bellboy, the elevator doors magnificently 
,hut, the sound stops and the enclosed, lonely 

Ing permeate th theatre. He tries to escape 
the other three aisles in the intimate Carter 

and I blocked by bricked window on all sides. 
nlficent Everyone becomes trapped with him. 

rrorn thl moment on however, the play begin to fall 
,and the reason is thus : When you have e sentially 

three character play, and an intimate, intimate 
heatrp, all three characters must be extremely strong, 

evuythlngs going to uffer. 
Polly Puterbaugh as I nez, a lesbian pessimist offers 

first touches of probl em . While her physical -n ss, 
unusual unnerving voice, and her long mean boots 
initia lly exci ting, one gets the impression that her 

is rather two-dimensional. As the play 
he stays much the same . She over-dictates 

h word with the same careful polish . The charac-
i good, but just a trifle flat.

The rea l problem though, comes with the entrance of 
Estelle as portrayed by Kathe Argo Where Inez appears 
two-<limensional , Estelle runs close to one-<limensional. 
Fstelle is required to run through a vigorous array of 
emotions : hysteria, anger, fright, tears, laughter, passion 
and so on, and M s. Argo is just not up to the task . The 
entire believability of Kelada's low-keyed, carefu ll y un-
overdramatic direction is lost here 

The problem becom s intensified with a strange 
failure to cope with the reality necessary in an intimate 
theatre like the Carter. The audience Just can't be made 
to buy a pretend spit in the face, a phony physical 
struggle, a non-passionate portrayal of physical passion 
It simply grates on the senses, and in a play where the 
psychological is all , the failure to really do things can 
only stand as a wall to prevent communicating the 
points of the piece. 

So, the physical incongruities begin to slowly add up 
A chair is called a divan; Garcin focusses carefully and 
believable when seeing things in the other world while 
Estelle looks at the floor, her fingernail s, anything; Inez 
looks for a mirror in her handbag and announces its 
absense before even really letting her eyes search the 
handbag; and I can 't help but notice the general irony 
of the four lit exit signs in the theatre as we contemplate 
the No Exit the play title suggests. 

Now maybe it was the first night jollies or something 
that caught the cas t in some shallow acting, and with 
another month of performance to go, it might actually 
come together. The ground work is certai nly there. 

The only true flaw with Kelada's direction I can see is 
that he either never decided on the play's climax, or 
rushed it by so fast (it was there, I saw it wh iz by) that he 
misses out on making his point. It was no suprise that 
when the show was over I heard one audience member 
ask "Is it over? or is this an intermission?" 

Well , somebody's got to hand it to the Globe for 
trying . Better thi s I suppose, than a season of syrupy 
si tuation comedies . And in all fairness , the production 
has some chilling moments that makes it worth the 
entire evening. But, on the whole, rather than delivering 
the pain and frustration that this people-are-hell drama 
hould project, the production indeed remains a 

" tickling that never hurts enough ."

Recently, an ( by 
Malcolm Smith 3Inared 
in the Triton Imes, 
entitled "How Gle Was 
Our Valley ." In tt,e ,rtlcle, 
Mr. Smith asselted that 
the current enerfJY crisis 
is symptomatic of critical 
shortages of raw 
materials with which the 
industrialized nations of 
the world wiii soon be 
faced . He projected that 
as the underdeveloped 
areas of the world (such 
as Africa) become in-. 
creasingly aware of the 
power they hold through 
the control of these 
resources, they will in-
creasingly withhold them 
from the nations of the 
West, wh ich will collapse 
and disintegrate, stripped 
of their supply of raw 
materials, leaving the 
road free and clear for 
Africa to "inherit the 
Earth. " 

Is there any val idity to 
this projection of the 
problems facing the 
United States (and othet · 
of the industrialized 
nations of the world) In 
the years ahead? With 
regard to its supply of 
energy resources (to use 
Mr . Smith 's own 
example) , the United 
States has enough coal to 
last an estimated 300 
years, enough oil (in-
cluding shale, for which 
the technology to extract 
oil already exists) to last 
for we ll over a century , 
and a much smaller 
supply of natural gas. The 
present oil shortage can 
be attributed to an in-
suff ic iency both of ex-
tracted petroleum and of 
ref inery capacity , but 
certainly not to an in-
suff ic iency of oi I as a 
natural resource with in 
the United States . 

The depletion of its 
natural resources is a 
phenomenon with wh ich 
every industrial society 
must eventually find itself 
confronted . How will it 
respond to th is problem? 
With regard to its non-
dep le table resources 
(those which can in 
pr inciple be replenished 

' indef in i tely , such as 
ti mber), it will be able to 
maintain its production at 
whatever level demanded, 
so long as it enjoys a 
social system whi ch 
make s poss ible the 
carrying on of long range 
product ion processes 
(thiS wou ld exclude the 
present social system s of 
Africa, Mr. Sm ith to the 
con t ra r y n ot-
w i ths tand i n>l) . W i th 
regard to i:s depletable 
resou rc e !'; , ho weve r, 
pro du .::tion will 
necessarily fall off as the 
supply o f each resource 
di mi n is hes. As i ts 
scarCi ty increases , its 
price w ill rise reduc ing 
the general level of 
consumpt ion o f the 
tesource an (. caus ing 
purchasers to use the 
resource more 
econom ically . If it'3 price 
rises suff icier tty, firms 
will beg in to 'eeycle the 
resource (as is being done 

presently With aluminum. 
in which the cost of 
recycl ing is less than the 
value of the recycled 
aluminum). In addition . 
firms will begin to 
substitute 01her more 
plentiful resources for the 
scarce resource in order 
to lower their costs of 
production. In short , a 
whole series of 
homeostasis reactions 
will arise within the 
context of a free market to 
reduce consumption of 
the resource and to 
ultimately reduce 
society's dependence 
upon the resource, 

Mr. Smith does not 
believe that the in-
dustrialized nations will 
be able to continue 
function ing after they are 
faced with shortages of 
certa i n depletable 
resources . If not , then 
why should not the un-
derdeveloped nations also 
perish when they have 
exhausted their 
depletable resources? 
But, according to Mr. 
Smith , " the 'un-
derdeveloped' countries 
will take civil ization to 
new heights," even after 
their depletable resources 
have vanished . Thus, Mr. 
Smith accepts the 
premise that i t is possible 
for a soc iety to cont inue 
production in the face of 
shortages, but that the 
industrialized nations of 
today will fail to meet the 
cha l lenge , wh i le the 
industrialized nations of 
tomorrow (which coin-
cidentally are starving to 
death today) w i ll succeed . 

Mr. Smith seems to 
view wealth as a matter of 
natural resources , with 
iron ore , copper, zinc , 
magnesium , coal , oil , and 
natural gas as the source , 
and man merely the tool. 
Yet there is perhaps no 
greater living refutation of 
this idea than the African 
continent itself , which 
stands as eloquent 
testimony to the futility of 
a li mitless wealth of 
natural resources ruled by 
barbarians . Throughout 
its history , Africa has 
been a continent 
i nhab i ted by savages , 
d ivided into warring tribes 
which slaughtered and 
sold each other Into 
slavery . With a heritage of 
mutilating puberty rites , 
torture , and cannibalism , 
Afr ica has had little 
chance to develop any of 
i ts natural resources. In 
the midst of the twent ieth 
century " space age ," 
Africa has barely risen 
above the stone age . 
Aside from its absence of 
any visible technology , 
what achievements have 
emanated from Afri ca in 
the pure sciences? Or in 
art o r philosophy or 
m a t hemat i c s or 
li terature? The 
si mu ltaneous absence of 
all of these elements Is 
not coincidental. All stem 
from a common source--
the power of man 's 
creative i l1i~:lig on ee , 
reshaping and rebuilding 
the world in the image of

his values . Of -what use 
would all of the resources 
in the world be to a band 
of tribal savages , 
maintaining their 
existence in the very same 
way discovered by therr 
ancestors thousands of 
years ago? Would they 
even begin to conceive of 
the potential benefits of 
oil, of the ways in which It 
could be harnessed , of 
the methods by which it 
cou ld be extracted and 
refined and converted into 
hundreds of different 
petroleum products , then 
distributed and marketed 
to thousands of pur-
chasers throughout the 
world? 

Will this be the cu lture 
that "will take civilization 
to new heights" ? Here is 
mr. Smith 's prediction : 
"The 'underdeveloped' 
nations will meanwhile 
pick out the best from 
Western technology , 
learning from our 
mistakes, and ... produce 
a more rational society 
... " During the course of 
five centuries since the 
advent of the Industrial 
revolution , have they yet 
learned from ou r 
mistakes? (Th is may be 
contrasted with Japan , 
which in the past 40 years 
has built itself from 
scratch into one of the 
leading industrial nat ions 
in the world , but which 
precisely for this reason 
has not been included by 
Mr. Smith along the 
nations that are to " inherit 
the wor.d".) 

Afr ica's supply of 
natural resources has 
ex isted , untapped , for 
thousands of years , and 
untouched from without 
might continue to exist in 
the same form for 
thousands of more years. 
Without the power of 
human intelligence , 
natural resources remain 
just so many natural 
resources, sitting beneath 
the Earth 's c ru st , 
providing benef i t to 
none, while directed 
toward a goal and a 
purpose by man's reason, 
they could have been the 
fountain of an unlimited 
number of benefits to an 

unlimited number of 
people living throughout 
the world . 

The source of all wealth 
is man's intelligence, and 
the resources he employs 
are merely the tools . Man 
will not perish after his 
fossil fuels have been 
exhausted ; long before 
th is stage has been 
reached , he will have 
learned to harness other, 
more efficient energy 
sources . Perhaps he will 
learn to harness and store 
the energy of the sun , or 
geothermal energy , or the 
energy of hydrogen as a 
fuel , or even the Earth's 
atmospheriC • electricity . 
When man develops the 
technology to harness the 
energy of controlled 
nuclear fusion , he will 
have pr-ovided himself 
with virtually unlimited 
source of energy . Or 
perhaps man will discover 
a totally new form of 
energy of whose 
ex istence he is not even 
presently aware (as 
science was not aware of

the existence and 
potentialities of nuclear 
Hnergy before Einstein's 
development of the 
Special Theory of 
Relativity). Nor will man 
be paralyzed by the 
depletion of any other of 
the Earth's natural 
resources . Man will 
always find ways to 
substitute plentiful for 
scarce resources, in -
.suring his ability to carry 
on an unlimited number 
of production processes. 
Perhaps he will eventually 
even develop the 
technology to convert one 
chemical element into 
another th rou gh a 
sequence of controlled 
nuclear react ions, in-
suring an unlimited 
supply of all desired raw 
materials . This may 
sound farfetched. but so 
did space travel 20 years 
ago . Look at the changes 
that have taken place in 
the last 50 years. Look at 
the enormous , un-
paralleled growth of 
science and technology 
and the fantastic increase 
in human knowledge that 
have taken place over 
such an inflntesimal span 
of man's history . The 
progress that has been 
made during this period 
of time has been im-
mense ; yet all that has 
been learned has been the 
product of man 's in -
telligence , of the ability 
he has acquired to deal so 
much more effectively 
with his environment by 
learning to use the natural 
resources around him in 
better and better ways . 
Who can imagine what 
heights man will reach 
within the next few 
hu ndred yea rs , if 
technology is left free to 
flourish in an unrestricted 
atmosphere , i n which 
scientists and in -
dustrialists do not have to 
prove the " ecolog ical " 
value of their discoveries 
to boards of government-
apPOinted bureaucrat ic 
demagogues and in which 
" windfall profits" for 

successful innovation will 
not be taxed away to 
support the growth of a 
malignant bureaucracy 
devouring its own 
society? 

My final words shall be 
addressed to an aspect of 
Mr. Smith 's philosophy 
that is spreading rapidly , 
inspired by the rise of the 
"ecology" movement-the 
hatred of luxury . Mr. 
Smith makes two 
references to this issue in 
his article . The first such 
passage reads , "They (the 
underdeveloped nations) 
will be able to preseve 
what is best in their 
lands , without destroying 
it in the never-ending and 
mindless search for more 
comfort, faster cars , and 
a laundry soap that gets 
clothers 'cleaner than 
clean·." The second such 
passage reads , "America 
will be destroyed by the 
very thing that she has 
touted as her finest asset-
-the absurd luxuries that 
so many deem to be 
necessities. "

in the strE'ets for better 
living and working r on-
ditions . They were 
demanding a broad range ot 
rights, including decent 
housing, a minimum wage. 
protective labor laws, and 
the right to vot~ 1fwo years 
later. in 1910, the In-
