THROUGH THE BAY’S HEAVY HAZE

By Kelsey Wong
Contributing Writer

Student representatives on a com-
mittee to revise UCSD’s speech policy 
expressed concern at last week’s A.S. 
Council meeting that potential revi-
sions could limit student voice on cam-
pus.

The committee was formed in 

January 2008 after students and com-
munity members protested policy revi-
sions proposed by the administration 
in spring 2007. 

After the San Diego chapter of 
the American Civil Liberties Union 
asserted in an eight-page letter that 10 
sections of the proposed policy were 
unconstitutional, administrators opted 
to scratch the contended policy and 
urged the creation of a committee to 
update the year-old policy instead.

Originally composed of 16 mem-
bers, including administrators, faculty, 
two A.S. councilmembers and one rep-
resentative from the Graduate Student 
Association, the committee has been 

reviewing the policy since then. 
Associate Vice President of Local 

Affairs Erin Brodwin and Sixth College 
senior James Baldwin, the committee’s 
current undergraduate student repre-
sentatives, gave a presentation before 
the A.S. Council to explain the items 
still under debate in revising the pol-
icy.

Brodwin said one of the primary 
student concerns is the further limita-
tion of “amplified sound zones,” specif-
ic areas in which students are allowed 
to speak out using amplification devic-
es during specific time frames. Current 

Campus Speech Rights Still Under Review

In Final Stage, Wedge Project Hits Pavement

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

The four-acre parcel of land north of Eleanor Roosevelt College may not be anyone’s paradise, but the “nation’s green-
est university” can’t expect to pave it and put up 
a parking lot without a little opposition.

More than 1,000 transfer students will settle 
into the new North Campus Housing complex 
this fall, but the future of their backyard — the 
remaining strip of land in a four-part landscap-
ing project known as the Wedge — remains 
uncertain.

In 1994, the UCSD Physical Planning 
Department proposed that the Wedge become 
a “rustic” open space linking three upcoming 
construction projects: ERC, the Rady School of 
Management and the North Campus Housing 
Project. The original report mapped out pedes-
trian trails and planned for natural storm-water 
drainage from adjacent lots. 

In October 2006, after three years of land-
scaping, the department projected a completion 
date of June 2009.

Three of the four segments of the Wedge 
are complete, but due to budget constraints, the 

Budget constraints stall green 
landscaping plans in North 
Campus; A.S. Council pushes 
administration to move forward.

New Grove Event Designed to 
Attract Business to Student Center
By Reza Farazmand
News Editor

The Grove Caffe dropped a  
request for $13,750 in events fund-
ing from the Associated Students 
at last week’s council meeting. 
Members of the cafe’s advisory com-
mittee instead submitted a unani-
mously approved request for $300 to 
fund Deejay Thursdays. 

The indebted cafe hopes to build 
its customer base and avoid fur-
ther financial setback with the new 
event, hosted by the Deejay and 
Vinylphiles Club. The event also 
features a $2 hot dog and beverage 
deal. 

The request was sponsored by 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Enterprises Chelsea Maxwell, who 
said that funding Deejay Thursdays 
for the remaining weeks of Winter 
Quarter would amount to a cost of 
$600, half of which will be provided 
by University Centers.  

The funds will go to DVC, 
money which the organization will 
put toward the purchase of new 
equipment and the funding of annu-
al events such as popular rave Let’s 

Bounce. 
Grove managers, in conjunction 

with A.S. Council representatives, 
decided to abandon their original 
request after receiving vocal pro-
test from councilmembers hesitant 
to provide any further funding to 
the enterprise, especially without a 
coherent long-term plan for its pro-
gramming ventures.

The Grove is now an estimated 
$109,214 in debt and has failed to 
report any significant profit over 
the last several months, a situation 
that Grove managers are seeking to 
amend by increasing visibility.

According to Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani, who serves on the coun-
cil’s Grove Advisory Board, coun-
cilmembers will vote on whether to 
provide an additional $1,000 to the 
Grove in order to sustain Deejay 
Thursdays for the rest of the aca-
demic year during tenth week of 
this quarter. 

“We were looking at options for 
what would be a cheaper way to get 
attention over to the old Student

The journal Pediatrics pub-
lished a study this month inves-
tigating the connection between 
elementary-school recess and 
children’s academic performance, 
concluding that recess is a crucial 
part of the educational process. 

The study followed 11,000 chil-
dren between the ages of eight 
and nine, and determined that 
children who were let out for more 
than 15 minutes of recess a day 
demonstrated better behavior in 
class than those who were not.

The link between more recess 
time and better behavior held up 
even after researchers controlled 
for variables such as gender, eth-
nicity, class size and whether the 
school was public or private.

Lead researcher Romina M. 
Barros, a pediatrician and assis-
tant clinical professor at the Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine, 
stressed the importance of the 
findings in a moment when many 
schools are cutting back on recess 

time.
“Sometimes you need data 

published for people at the edu-
cational level to start believing 
it has an impact,” Barros said. 
“We should understand that kids 
need that break because the brain 
needs that break.”

Barros also disagreed with the 
practice of withholding recess 
time from children who demon-
strate behavioral problems.

“Recess should be part of the 
curriculum,” she said. “You don’t 
punish a kid by having them miss 
math class, so kids shouldn’t be 
punished by not getting recess.”

The study is part of a growing 
area of research suggesting that 
behavior, concentration and aca-
demic performance are improved 
by physical fitness, recreation and 
time spent in nature.

Harvard researchers studied 
1,800 middle school students 
and found that the more physi-
cal fitness tests children passed, 
the better they did on academic 
tests, according to a report in 
the Journal of School Health. The 
study also suggested that children 

can benefit academically from 
physical activity during gym class 
and recess.

According to Andrea Faber 
Taylor, a child environment 
and behavior researcher at the 
University of Illinois, research sug-
gests that all children, especially 
those with attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder, can benefit from 
spending time in nature during the 
school day. Taylor recommended 
children take walks or have access 
to green courtyards.

A team of UCSD researchers 
have developed drug-delivering 
nanoparticles that minimize the 
toxic effects usually associated 
with nanoscale material.

Nanoparticles used in cancer-
treatment research glow under 
ultraviolet light, a property which 
allows doctors to determine the 
amount of cancerous growth pres-
ent and detect the smallest of 
tumors. 

However, this luminescence is 
achieved by including toxic organ-
ic chemicals or tiny structures 
called quantum dots, which leave 
behind potentially harmful heavy 
metals.

UCSD chemistry professor 
Michael Sailor led a research team 
in an effort to create miniscule 
flakes of silicon that can glow 
brightly, slowly release cancer 
drugs and break down into harm-
less byproducts.

“It is the first luminescent 
nanoparticle that was purposely 
designed to minimize toxic side 
effects,” Sailor said. “This new 
design meets a growing need for 
nontoxic alternatives that have a 
chance to make it into the clinic to 
treat human patients.”

The researchers reported that 
these nanoparticles could help 
deliver cancer-fighting drugs safe-
ly and effectively in the Feb. 22 
online edition of Nature Materials.

“The goal is to use the nanopar-
ticles to chaperone the drug 
directly to the tumor, to release 
it into the tumor rather than other 
parts of the body,” Sailor said.

policy limits amplified speech to within 
these zones — which include Price 
Center Plaza and Revelle Plaza — for 
use between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. on 
weekdays and 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on 
weekends. 

According to Baldwin, administra-
tors on the committee have proposed 
revisions that would further limit these 
hours, decreasing allotted time frames 
in some areas, including Price Center 
Plaza, to periods of one hour. 

“The amplified sound zones are still 
an issue,” Brodwin said at the council 
meeting. “We feel this is not a free 
policy.”

Associate Controller and commit-
tee Chair Sally Brainerd said she and 
other administrators involved in the 
policy revision process aim to preserve 
student speech rights.

“The committee strongly supports 
free speech and does not endorse limit-
ed ‘free speech zones,’” Brainerd said in 
an e-mail. “The committee is working 
toward a way to handle the potential 
problem that amplified sound can pose 

if it gets to be too loud. Speech that 
does not involve amplification will be 
permitted unless it is disruptive.”

Though the committee has yet to 
formally discuss regulations preventing 
demonstrators from camping out on 
campus, Baldwin said that administra-
tors have suggested such limitations 
might be introduced. 

“We’ve been told kind of infor-
mally that there’s student health con-
cerns that [administrators] have with 
permitting camping, so that it seems 
that they’re reluctant to allow that,” 
Baldwin said.

Brodwin said he believes these 
rights should be preserved for students 
and community members participating 
in campus demonstrations. 

“A lot of people camped out dur-
ing the apartheid process, for example, 
to let people know what’s going on,” 
Brodwin said at the meeting. “Camping 
out was one of the ways that they got 
noticed. Prohibiting this type of action 
is prohibiting what we can do.”

The committee projected to com-

plete a drafted revision to the policy 
by May 1, though Baldwin said that 
— given the scope of the task at hand 
and the need to allow a reasonable 
amount of time for a public comment 
period during the process — this date 
will most likely be extended. He said 
the committee hopes to avoid a sit-
uation similar to the release of the 
2007 proposal, in which this comment 
period was held during finals week, 
limiting student participation in the 
proceedings.

“The rest of the committee agrees 
that all parties who are interested 
should have a chance to comment, so 
if we were to release it any time after 
fifth or sixth week of next quarter, it’s 
going to be difficult to get those peo-
ple to comment on it, and we don’t 
really want that,” he said. “We want a 
very transparent process this time.”

Center,” Lakhani said. “Part of the 
problem with the $13,000 request 
was that the events were too varied 
and they didn’t have a common time 
and place.”

Lakhani said he hopes that Deejay 
Thursdays, held for the first time last 
week, will attract attention not only 
to the Grove but to all the surround-
ing student-run businesses.

“Hopefully, this event will serve 
as a stepping stone for future events 
to happen at the old Student Center,” 
Lakhani said. “I don’t want to see 
that part of campus just become a 
bunch of Hi Thais and McDonald’s 
and Burger Kings. I’d like to keep 
it student run. So hopefully this 
will be one of the many things that 
will get people over to that part of 
campus.” 

Grove student manager Autumn 
Hays said she expects Deejay Thursdays 
to inject new life into the cafe and its 
Student Center community.

“It brings attention to the Grove 
and creates the kind of unique atmo-
sphere we want here,” Hays said. 
“This place is for the students, run by 
the students and — to put it simply 
— it’s a great place to hang out. It’s 
relaxed, friendly and stays strong to 
the ideas of community and what the 
students of UCSD want to create here 
on campus. We and our fellow stores 
and shops in the student center are 
working to keep that feeling alive.”

DJVC President Adam Timmerberg 
said his deejays will attempt to exude 
the cafe’s laid-back atmosphere in 
their weekly performances.

“It’ll be pretty much just low 
energy, relaxed music,” Timmerberg 
said. “People are there drinking cof-
fee, having meetings, smoking ciga-
rettes, and we want to match that 
vibe and go along with it.”

Deejays to Hold Weekly Performances at Grove
▶ GROVE, from page 1

Physical Planning and Environmental 
Health and Safety departments are 
now in talks with Transportation and 
Parking Services to devise a tempo-
rary, cost-effective use for the site of 
Wedge Phase Four.

Meanwhile, a coalition of depart-
ments and student organizations is 
urging the administration to tear up 
the existing pavement once and for 
all. Suggestions include establishing 
the space as an organic garden and 
using it to showcase ecologically sus-
tainable initiatives.

On Feb. 25, the A.S. Council unan-
imously passed a 
resolution urging 
the university to 
abandon discussion 
of making the site a 
parking lot.

The resolu-
tion, sponsored by 
A.S. All-Campus 
Senator Chris 
Westling, stated 
that using the space 
for parking would 
be inconsistent 
with the UCSD 
Principles of Sustainability — “tak-
ing from the Earth only what it can 
provide indefinitely, thus leaving 
future generations no less than we 
have access to ourselves.” The new lot 
would also fail to adhere to UCSD’s 
goal of zero waste by 2020, council-
members said, since pavement is an 
impermeable surface that harms sur-
rounding ecosystems.

“If we really want to pursue sus-
tainability at UCSD, we can’t expand 
parking,” Westling said. “Every sur-
face lot on campus is technically a 
‘temporary parking lot,’ but there is a 
very high possibility that things can 
get put on the back burner and stay 
on the back burner for a very long 

time.”
The Graduate Student Association 

will vote on a similar resolution next 
week.

Wedge Phase Four has been paved 
for decades, and is now occupied by 
construction equipment and supplies 
from the North Campus Housing 
Project.

The final stage of the natural Wedge 
would cost the university roughly $2 
million, according to Brian Gregory, 
assistant vice chancellor of Strategic 
Campus Resource Initiatives. Given 
the growing demand for parking on 
campus, he said the university is con-

sidering the lot as a 
temporary solution 
while it secures 
funds.

“We have great-
ly improved water 
that runs off from 
[Wedge phases one 
through three], and 
that’s why we want 
to do Wedge Four,” 
he said. “But in the 
meantime, we don’t 
want [the land] to 
just sit there, so we 

want to use it for parking until such 
time that the funding is available.”

Housing and Dining Services has 
agreed to contribute $500,000 for 
Wedge Phase Four, but no other fund-
ing sources have been confirmed.

This month, the Campus 
Community Planning Committee will 
charter a subcommittee — the Open 
Space Committee — to examine open 
spaces such as the Wedge. Members 
will include one undergraduate stu-
dent, one graduate student and repre-
sentatives from a number of campus 
departments.

like that of the New York Times’ Jim 
Rutenberg, who was responsible for 
that last fallacy about Accountability 
Now. We would have been massively 
misled, had you not revealed that the 
group is actually doing the complete 
opposite: demanding accountabil-
ity from elected officials to guar-
antee they appropriately represent 
their constituents. And you deserve 
applause for doing the press corps’ 
dirty work. Keep it up! Affectionately, 
the American public.

Dear Student Center custodians, 
Thanks for doing the campus’ dirty 
work — cleaning up the piss, shit, 
vomit and beer we’re too selfish and 
plastered to clean up ourselves. But 
please consider leaving the bathrooms 
unlocked at night again, they’re per-
fect for hotboxing. Sincerely, UCSD’s 
marsupial-loving hooligans.

Dear aforementioned hooligans, 
Thanks for tirelessly rebelling against 
UCSD’s largely accepted lameness. 
You’re obnoxious and obscene, but 
you’re also genuinely excited about 
college and you go out of your way 
to give us reasons to be excited, too. 
Looking forward to the Sun God 
waterslide, Tritons.

Dear Internet, Thanks for keeping 
me informed on all these issues, big 
and small, while simultaneously play-
ing made-for-me radio. I don’t know 
how I’d swallow all that bad news if it 
weren’t for a helping of your melodic 
sugar. With admiration, Hadley.

Admin Shouldn’t Uproot Ideals for a Little Pavement

STATE NEWS — Call it good tim-
ing, or just sheer opportunism: 
Last Monday, Assemblyman Tom 
Ammiano (D-San Francisco) intro-
duced a bill seeking to legalize mari-
juana use for individuals over age 21. 

The Marijuana Control, 
Regulation and Education Act (AB 
390) would tap into an estimated 
$14 billion industry — leading to 
a potential $1.3 billion increase in 
annual tax revenue for the state 
of California and an additional 
$50-per-ounce levy on retail sales. 
Although controversial, the bill is 
a practical solution to California’s 
budget crisis.

In the aftermath of massive bud-
get cuts and tax hikes, Ammiano’s 
bill would establish a wholesale 
market for marijuana, authorizing 
its sale by licensed retailers. Past 
efforts to decriminalize the popular 
drug, such as 1996’s Proposition 215, 
which authorized medical use, pale 

in comparison to Ammiano’s bold 
proposal. If passed, his bill would 
make California the first state in 
the country to legalize recreational 
marijuana use. 

It’s no secret that cannabis is 
California’s unofficial cash crop — a 
covert, though common, Californian 
pastime. While the possession, sale 
and consumption 
of marijuana for 
nonprescribed use 
is illegal, statistics 
show that restric-
tions outlined by 
the law don’t stop 
users. 

According to 
the 2006 National 
Survey on Drug 
Use and Health, 
marijuana is by far 
the most frequent-
ly used illicit drug in the United 
States, with around 3.3 million users 
in California alone. Moreover, a 
2006 U.S. Justice Department sur-
vey reported that 16.3 percent of 
college-age respondents said they 
had used the drug within the last 
week that they were surveyed, most 
likely an underestimated count of 
the true user population. 

The cost of enforcement, how-
ever, is more alarming than the 
drug’s usage rates. The government 

spent about $41.8 million on law 
enforcement for over 800,000 mari-
juana arrests in 2007, according to 
FBI Uniform Crime Reports. The 
exorbitant cost only represents one 
branch of the ongoing federal war 
on drugs, which costs tens of bil-
lions of dollars every year in tax 
revenue. Although a moratorium 

on drug enforce-
ment altogether 
isn’t feasible, it’s 
time to reconsider 
the costs and ben-
efits of focusing 
efforts on such a 
commonly used 
substance in the 
wake of economic 
disaster.

But where 
supporters of AB 
390 see a lucra-

tive opportunity, opponents see 
Pandora’s box. 

Longtime opponents of mari-
juana legalization argue the sub-
stance is a gateway drug leading to 
heavier substance abuse. However, 
many studies, including one con-
ducted by the American Psychiatric 
Association in 2006, have shown 
that early marijuana use does not 
correlate with the use of hard drugs 
among adults. 

Another concern is that legalizing 

marijuana would increase its usage. 
However, legalized recreational drug 
use in the Netherlands debunks this 
logic. A 2004 study conducted at 
UC Santa Cruz comparing the usage 
of marijuana in the United States 
to that of the Netherlands exam-
ined trends in Amsterdam and San 
Francisco, where recreational use is 
generally tolerated, and concluded 
that legal provisions and sanctions 
had little relevance in promoting or 
preventing its use. 

Statistics demonstrated similari-
ties in the average age of marijuana 
smokers at both the onset and height 
of their usage, and also revealed that 
a majority of respondents from both 
cities had not used the drug in the 
past week or even the past year 
before being surveyed, suggesting 
its legal status didn’t influence usage 
patterns in any significant way. The 
similarity in trends between two 
countries with vastly different drug 
policies definitely shows govern-
mental drug regulation doesn’t 
change the number of pot smokers. 

Controlling and taxing marijua-
na would go a long way in uprooting 
its black-market trade and promote 
safe, legitimate entrepreneurship. 
Furthermore, the current version of 
Ammiano’s proposed bill calls for a

Legalizing California’s Cash Crop Would Put State in the Green

By Trevor Cox
Associate Opinion Editor

ON CAMPUS  — The university 
may shelve a long-standing campus 
green project in favor of restoring a 
surface parking lot — totally contra-
dicting its goals for environmental 
sustainability.

UCSD Physical Planning special-
ists drafted a plan 15 years ago for a 
four-phase sustainable open space 
consisting mostly of trees, plants 
and pathways to be completed with-
in Eleanor Roosevelt College, called 
the Wedge. 

The first three phases of the 
plan were completed over the last 
six years (phases one and two in 
2003 with the completion of ERC, 
and phase three in 2007 with the 
completion of the Rady School of 
Management). Each phase of the 
project found funding from vary-
ing sources, corresponding with the 
beneficiaries of the specific phase. 

Phase three, for instance, cost 
roughly $1.5 million by its comple-
tion in 2007 and was funded equally 
by Academic Affairs and campus 
resources.

The fourth and final phase was 
to be completed with the new North 
Campus transfer-student housing 
by this June. 

The area (dubbed Wedge Four) 
was paved 20 years ago and has 
been used as a surface parking lot. 
It presently serves as a construction 
lay-down for the North Campus 
housing development. But in the 
absence of sufficient funding for 
the estimated $2 million project, the 
administration has suggested the 
space be used as a temporary sur-
face lot — a prospect that might not 
seem so underhanded were it not 
the opposite of the space’s intended 
use.

Brian Gregory, assistant vice 
chancellor for Strategic Campus 
Resource Initiatives, and Brian 
D’Autremont, director of Parking 
Transportation and Services, dis-
cussed giving the space to Parking 
and Transportation Services for five 
years, to create a temporary sur-
face lot. The lot would have 125 to 
150 spots for “S” and “B” permit 
holders. According to Gregory, the 
university is committed to complet-
ing Wedge Four but lacks sufficient 
funding.

Though every surface lot is 
intended to be a temporary place-
holder, many of the spaces lack 
future building plans, making them 
temporary strictly in theory. There’s 
no guarantee that a temporary 
Wedge Four surface lot wouldn’t be 
accepted as permanent time.

Restoring another surface lot 
would reveal the hypocrisy of both 
our supposedly green university and 
P&TS. P&TS promotes alternative 
forms of transit, having tripled the 
size of its free bus program with 
plans for route expansion.

But nothing with the lot is final 
yet. D’Autremont said P&TS is inter-
ested in using the area as a surface 
lot. 

The student-run Social & 
Environmental Sustainability 
Committee hopes to prevent Wedge 
Four from becoming a surface 
lot. On Feb. 25, the A.S. Council 
approved its resolution, which pro-
vided alternatives to converting 
the space into a parking lot. One 
alternative was seeking Wedge Four 
funding from campus departments 
such as Physical Planning, and from 
green technology businesses before 
abandoning the project. 

Another possibility allows stu-
dent groups to compete to use the 
land temporarily for sustainable 
purposes, such as an urban farm 
or garden, which would effectively 
maintain the Wedge’s primary goal 
at minimal cost to the university. 

Were the administration com-
mitted to increasing sustainability, 
solutions like these would have been 
investigated and researched before 

the P&TS possibility was even dis-
cussed. Lacking the full $2 mil-
lion for Wedge Four’s concept is no 
excuse to cast aside sustainability 
plans; this final phase was, after all, 
supposed to be completed in a few 
months’ time. 

Asking student orgs to pitch cost-
effective, temporary alternatives to 
the current Wedge Four concept 
and considering those suggestions 
would advance sustainability goals 
without compromise.  

Though we are facing economic 
hardship, and certain projects lack  
funding, that’s no justification for 
throwing our ideals to the wind. 

Even if we can’t complete Wedge 
Four right now, we won’t see prog-
ress if we stall plans — and we can-
not justly call UCSD a leader in sus-
tainability if we allow Wedge Four 
to become another surface lot.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

portion of tax revenue to fund drug-
education programs. 

By limiting the sale of mari-
juana to licensed retailers, consum-
ers would likely purchase the drug 
legally and forgo the risk of ille-
gal transactions, gradually putting 
small-time drug dealers and gangs 
out of business.

As an extra boost to legaliza-
tion efforts, U.S. Attorney General 
Eric Holder hinted Feb. 25 that the 
Obama administration would stop 
federal raids on legal cannabis clubs 
in California, reversing a trend in 
marijuana regulation that peaked 
with the Bush administration’s ban 
on university-sponsored medical 
marijuana research. 

Pres. Barack Obama, who admit-
ted to drug use as a teenager, seeks 
to lessen federal involvement in 
regulating drug use and instead del-
egate the responsibility to individu-
al states, making marijuana usage a 
health issue, rather than a criminal 
one. Ammiano’s recent bill right-
fully follows this trend, promot-
ing the importance of individual 

responsibility.
Ignoring the funds California 

might collect from increased tour-
ism, the projected marijuana tax 
would earn over $1 billion alone — 
a sum roughly equal to the spending 
cuts for both of California’s univer-
sity systems. 

Why not require a percentage of 
this revenue to go toward education? 
Investment in our college system 
should be of infinitely higher prior-
ity than tampering with a relatively 
innocuous and private pastime. 

Should California take the lead 
and approve this bill, it is possible 
that other states would eventually 
follow suit and bring us closer to the 
end of a costly and ineffective war 
both drugs and personal liberties.

Ammiano’s proposal is a step 
in the right direction and comes 
when the antiquated moral debate 
over marijuana isn’t nearly as rel-
evant as the positive fiscal impact 
it would have on California’s failing 
economy.

Ethiopia

By Erik Jepsen
Senior Staff Writer

I
f your parents have seen Ethiopia on the news lately, 
chances are you’ll need an alternative destination for 
spring break. Africa’s oldest independent country and 
arguably the cradle of civilization, Ethiopia is famous 
for its gourmet coffee but perhaps better known for its 

periodic droughts, famines, long civil conflict and border 
wars with neighboring Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan. But for 
those with a sense of adventure and thirst for new cultural 
experiences, my recommendation stands strong. 

Despite its political unrest, life in Ethiopia remains family-
oriented and built around tribal societies. Locals are hospitable 
and friendly — foreigners are often treated like celebrities. At

Budapest

A
fter arriving in Budapest, it often takes 
months to find the perfect pastry shop, 
tucked away in the Buda Hills.

Local transportation maps more 
closely resemble complicated electronic 

diagrams, routes of colored wire weaving through 
the city; fully understanding the layout could take 
a lifetime of wrong turns, unknown trams and 
unplanned adventures. But a few months in, you’ll 
have mastered enough Hungarian to order a malnàs 
krèmes, the raspberry cream puff that reigns over all 
other cream puffs, and a hosszù kàvè — the best way 
to drink coffee in Budapest.

Hungary’s ancient roots and strong Central 
European flavor nuance this largely undiscovered 
study-abroad destination, built as much on gro-

tesque horrors and brutal loss as on the continent’s 
romantic spirit. Though classes are limited and 
located in an unused corner of Eötvös Loránd 
University, lessons and field trips focus more on the 
local lifestyle than anything else, taking students 
deep into the heart of the city. Professors understand 
that the foreign dirt we crave extends far beyond 
the white walls of the university or the structured 
confines of the Education Abroad Program, which 
would be perfectly happy retelling the epic legacy 
of Szent Istvàn or reciting a detailed account of the 
1956 revolution for the whole semester.

The overwhelming smell of freshly baked pas-
tries wafts through metro stations. Tiny stands over-
flowing with goodies wait at the top of escalators 
— announcing the holy marriage of sweet chocolate 
and flaky crust, a faithful promise of warm dough

CHEAP BECAUSE IT’S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT TO KNOW THE GOOD OL’ U.S. OF A. 
By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

S
ure, jetting off to a foreign 
country is glamorous and 
all, but all the true adventur-
ers are staying in the states 
this spring break. So grab a 

few friends, load up the most reliable 
car you can find with road-trip essen-
tials (U.S. map, cash, camera and 
extra memory stick, sleeping bags, 
tent with rain tarp, hiking clothes, 
casual clothes, night-out clothes, lots 
of water and a large bag of potato 
chips for later) and get the hell out 
of La Jolla.

Set the ground rules ahead of 
time: Road trips are about stopping 
wherever the road takes you, so make 
sure nobody in your group gets too 
caught up on the destination. I mean, 
if you need to stop at the world’s larg-
est thermometer, you need to stop 
at the world’s largest thermometer 
— no explanation necessary, that’s 
the point. Start your journey the way 
Hunter S. Thompson would: Vegas. 
Geographically it’s a great place to 
spend the first night; you don’t want 
to overwhelm yourselves with too 
much driving right out of the gates. 
But be careful to budget your funds. 
Go the cheap motel route and check 
out the economical novelties old 
Vegas (Fremont Street) has to offer. 
Or, if you do decide to hit the strip, 
get your eat and drink on ahead of 
time and bring some hot girls to get 
you into clubs, but drink plenty of 
water so you won’t be too hungover to 
wake up early and head east on I-15.

Remember, this trip is about seeing 
all the great Southwest has to offer, and 
in Utah that means polygamists. So 
as you pass through Hurricane (and 

take advantage of appropriate “rock 
you like a” photo opportunities) don’t 
hesitate to take a half-hour detour to 
visit the Merry Wives Cafe. Seriously, 
do it. But watch the time because the 
girls at Hildale’s only restaurant close 
their kitchen up early. Once you’ve 
had your fill of heartland cooking and 
fundamentalist living, set out into the 
red-dirt wilderness. 

Try to snag a campsite inside Zion 
National Park, because those com-
mercial ones really gouge you, and 
set up that rain tarp! The area is 
prone to night showers even during 
the skin-melting summer heat. After 
setting up camp, go exploring. Leave 
the park and try to find a single street 
lamp, to witness a real-life Discovery 
Channel ballet as bats swoop out of 
the majestic dark and devour bugs 
swarming near the light. Set an alarm 
before you nestle into your sleeping 
bag; you’ll want to wake up early 
enough to see the sunrise (partially 
because it’s gorgeous and partially 

because it gets so densely hot that if 
you sleep in, you’ll feel like you just 
woke up from being born.

Zion has a pretty sweet setup. It’s got 
a great range of paths to suit novice and 
expert hikers alike and a cute trolley 
system to take you midday-break site 
seeing around the park. Unless you’re 
really hardcore, you should stick to the 
simple trails — easygoing exploration 
is more fun anyway. And definitely 
check out more than one path! While 
the front of the park’s beginner trails 
take you past cinematic waterfalls and 
mountain pools, the back of Zion has 
even cooler river-made slot canyons. 

After a long and sweaty day of 
hiking the last thing you’ll want to 
do is pile back into the car, but there’s 
something special waiting if you can 
just make it to Green River. There’s 
nothing special about this middle-of-
nowhere hotel circle at first glance, 
but check into a suite at the Super 8 
Motel (don’t worry, the suite is still 
cheaper than any other hotel) and 
watch your excursion mates’ faces 
as they scan the room, because past 
the dingy bathroom and across from 
the tacky-motel bedspread lies a 
giant, heart-shaped Jacuzzi tub. No 
lie. Truckers need to honeymoon 
somewhere, after all. Bonus: Come 
morning, Super 8 has a respectable 
continental breakfast so you can snag 
some extra Froot Loops for the road.

And you’ll be on the road for a 
while. You know how people say the 
Midwest is just a bunch of cornfields? 
They’re right. Once you get past the 
Rockies — and that long-forgotten 
potato-chip bag explodes from the 
altitude — there’s a whole lot of corn 
and soybeans, plus some cultural 
nostalgia in the form of Buffalo Bill’s 
gravesite and Oregon Trail stopover-

point Fort Kearney (now used for 
“died of dysentery” photo ops). 

Make sure to watch your gas tank 
through these states, as service sta-
tions aren’t frequent. Also, if you 
decide to stop at one after sundown, 
keep in mind that it’s probably the 
only light source for 100 miles, which 
means every flying bug in the county 
is waiting to swarm your car. 

Soon enough you’ll be in Chicago! 
Get ready for the fanciest 7-Elevens this 
great land has to offer. And definitely 
take advantage of the city’s excellent 
public transportation (you might just 
see two old men break into fisticuffs). 
After you’ve spent a half day doing all 
that touristy museum and park stuff, 
and a day and a half free roaming and 
enjoying real Chicago food — it’s not 
all hot dogs and deep-dish pizza — 
you’ll be back on the road.

After more touristing in St. Louis 
(claustrophobia isn’t worth the cost 
of going up in the arch, but the first-
floor museum is worth a peek), you’ll 
be on your way to Tulsa, Okla. — the 
land of Sonic Burger cherry limes and 
colossal churches, seriously, complete 
with rotating neon JESUS signs. While 

you’re in the area, you have to visit the 
Oklahoma Aquarium. It’s got probably 
the world’s only indoor beaver exhibit, 
info on how to enjoy the aquarium’s 
residents at home in your very own 
kitchen and even a go-fishing pond 
for the kids.

By this point in your adventure 
Spring Quarter is about to start, so 
fly through the tip of Texas and New 
Mexico until you hit Winslow, Ariz., 
for a rest (there’s a great Route 66 Motel 
that’s super cheap and the incense-
burning caretaker will hook you up 
with the most recently cleaned room). 
But be careful, cops in this Eagles-
glorified small town get their kicks 
hassling visitors. In the morning you 
can stop by Standing on the Corner 
Park, or visit one of the area’s many 
authentic corners. And your next 
move is up to you — stop by the Grand 
Canyon for more national park camp-
ing and hiking, head to Los Angeles for 
neon-lit clubbing, or race back to S.D. 
to get in some beach time before class.

the marketplace, you will be considered 
a curiosity, often followed more closely 
than the Pied Piper by both children 
and adults.

Seeing as it’s one of the world’s 
poorest nations, accomodations within 
Ethiopia are extraordinarily inexpen-
sive. Nicer hotels in the capital city of 
Addis Ababa run from $10 to $20 a 

night. As for food: Normally, tourism 
boards recommend you bring a strong 
appetite, but in Ethiopia, bring a strong 
stomach. However, if you like sour-
dough bread, the local version — injera 
— is a slice of heaven with every meal.

For photographers, Ethiopia pro-
vides a wide array of landscape oppor-
tunities, but none that overshadow the 
beauty of the people. Energetic, wide-

eyed and all-around colorful characters 
paint the streets in their proud culture. 

However, the eagerness of the 
locals to have their photo taken is 
not shared by military and police; it is 
with a cautious slight of hand that you 
should turn a camera in their direc-
tion. It’s also important to ask before 
taking photos of villagers, as many 
carry machetes.

blooming gardens and dancing foun-
tains. The summer heat brings out 
50-cent ice cream — best when eaten 
with friends on the cool riverbank —
making way for teeming bowls of gou-
lash stew and fresh Debreceni sausages 
hot enough to counter the autumn 
breeze. Winter Christmas markets fill 
the main square with wooden stands, 
holiday smells and mulled wine.

But trumping all is the tùrò rudi, a 
chocolate bar that, much like Hungary 
itself, contains an inexplicable lure that 
lingers long after the last taste. With 

a cheese-like tùrò filling encased in a 
chocolate shell, it survives only in the 
chilled walls of a refrigerator. Because 
of this, transporting tùrò rudi to the 
U.S. has proved impossible; going back 
to Hungary is really the only option.

My bittersweet return called for 
a readjustment period equivalent (if 
not more difficult) to when I arrived 
in Budapest. Each Rubik’s cube and 
paprika bottle still recalls fond memo-
ries. Maybe this is the curse of studying 
abroad: loving, yet having to leave, the 
city, a craving for tùrò rudi still linger-
ing, sweet and subtle, on the tongue.

poland OFF THE 
EURO 
PATHDEFY THE BIKINI: BEEF UP YOUR WINTER PARTS 

By Alyssa Bereznak
Senior Staff Writer

U
nless you drink an electric 
blanket’s worth of its world-
famous vodka, Poland is no 
place to show off your scan-
dalous spring-break bikini. 

But if you want to steer clear of the 
masses and explore a culture still largely 
untouched by American influence, this 
Eastern European hub offers quite the 
charismatic bang for your zloty. 

Much of Poland is still recovering 
from a brutal ass-kicking in World 
War II, so to avoid ending up in some 
dilapidated town, choose your destina-
tion carefully. Gdansk is the country’s 

main Baltic Sea port, and is a comfort-
able departure point for many beachy 
resorts on the north coast. Almost as 
mesmerizing as the Polish language’s 
XYZ-ridden alphabet, its Technicolor 
buildings and tidy streets lay on the 
charm like Casanova in his hip stage.

The modest Polish lifestyle flies 
well on a student budget. Pay-by-
weight thrift stores shack up next to 
government-subsidized milk bars, 
lasting inventions of the 1960s com-
munist regime offering cheap tradi-
tional Polish dishes like borsch, a sour 
beet soup, or pierogi, potato dumplings 
stuffed with meat or cheese. (A word of

NO ROSETTA REQUIRED

By Chris Kokiousis
Senior Staff Writer

F
orget all about Frodo Baggins 
and comedy-folk duos, because 
those familiar exports only hint 
at the greatness that is “Australia’s 
Canada.” New Zealand is the little 

country that could, with natural beauty in 
every terrain and climate imaginable and 
enough sheep and cattle to fill 100 million 
mince pies.

Kiwis (New Zealanders) use tomato 

sauce instead of ketchup, don’t tip and 
adore their booze. They will go out of their 
way to downplay everything they’ve cre-
ated — but still, “Flight of the Conchords” 
is huge right now, and Peter Jackson is 
nothing less than a golden god.

Wellington, the political and self-pro-
claimed cultural capital of New Zealand, 
is what San Francisco would be if it were 
smushed to half its size; cleared of bums, 
trash and major crime; then filled with 
friendlier, down-to-earth people that actu-
ally say hello to each other on the street. 

Because of its coastal location and 
proximity to the notoriously drafty Cook 
Strait, Wellington is also one of the windi-
est cities in the world. The town’s three 
main thoroughfares — Courtenay Place, 
Cuba Street and Lambton Quay (pro-
nounced “key”) — all host their own 

variety of shops, cafes, theaters and bars: 
Courtenay has the upscale nightclubs and 
restaurants, Cuba’s filled with an infinite 
variety of coffeehouses and boho bou-
tiques and Lambton’s got the mainstream 
fast food and chain stores.

Welly has more cafes per capita than 
New York City, and while its urban popu-
lation sits at around 380,000, you can 
walk from one end of town to the other 
in under an hour. Watch a pro rugby or 
cricket game at Westpac Stadium, hit the 
beach at nearby Oriental Bay, visit the 
enormous (and free) Te Papa Museum, sip 
morning or afternoon tea at a local cafe 
and catch some NZ indie music at Bodega 
Bar — all in a day’s work. Just know that 
when a Kiwi says the phrase “sweet as” 
excitedly, it’s “as” with one “S,” not two. 
Cheers.

BUCK THE DONKEY SHOW

Rosarito
By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

T
ijuana can be a great getaway for 
budding freshmen in need of a mid-
week bender. After passing through 
the creaky, rotating steel partition 
that marks the border, a quick taxi 

ride suddenly dumps you on Avenida de la 
Revolucion, a booming strip of all-you-can-
drink nightclubs, seedy stripper joints and 
back-alley farmacias. But when Coko Bongo 
grows as dull as an SDSU frat party and 
Hollywood Ray begins calling you by name, 
consider asking your driver to head south 
down the expressway for an extra 20 minutes 
to the resort city of Rosarito — a smaller, 
cleaner version of TJ with just as much night-
life but without the drug-cartel gang violence.

Better yet, stay a while. Rosarito, which 
attracts about one million visitors a year, is 
known for its vibrant spring break. Cheap 

shopping, good eating (take a daytrip to Puerto 
Nuevo for some fresh lobster), monster dance 
clubs and enough surfing, horseback riding 
and sunbathing to cure even the most severe 
post-finals blues makes this beach town a 
prime destination for cash-strapped students 
seeking an inter-quarter holiday.

If you can, book a few nights for your group 
at the Festival Plaza Hotel, located within com-
fortable walking distance of Papas and Beer, 
Iggy’s, Club Tequilas and Señor Frog’s. Decent 
restaurants and bars fill out the lobby, and dur-
ing the day, you can lounge by the pool, enjoy 
a deep-tissue massage, hop on a carnival ride 
or start early and grab some brew at a nearby 
cantina. Rates start at about $100 per night.

When the sun goes down, a streetful of 
hopefuls will offer exclusives to their venues, but 
Papas and Beer usually beats the compettition 
with a mechanical bull and border-style tequila 
shots — an attendant’s whistle in your ear and 
liquor poured straight down your throat.

Interview by David Harvey
Senior Staff Writer

Katie Dash: Take a trip to the Thames. The 
[London Eye] is the main tourist spot — you can 
see Parliament right across the road and, in the dis-
tance, if you’re high enough, you can see St. Paul’s 
Cathederal. Walking along the Thames at that point 
is just pretty cool. If you go by Embankment then 
Chelsea area you can see the park and it’s beautiful, 
especially at night. ... I would also tell people to go 
to Leicester Square at night, if you’re a tourist.
Natasha Lewis-Smith: Don’t go to Leicester Square.
KD: But if we’re talking about typical tourist things 
to do, then you have to do it. I would say go to some 
art galleries as well — Tate Modern is awesome. 
NL: They found this massive old warehouse right 
on the River Thames on the south bank [near] the 
London Eye, and that’s where it’s all at. They basi-
cally gutted the whole warehouse ... and in the main 
hall, they always have a really big exhibition.
KD: They have fantastic installations there. And 
also I would recommend the White Cube galleries. 
You get really random people — Damian Hirst, 
Tracy Emin, they are part of the White Cube crew. 
I would say National Gallery as well if you want to 
see the classic paintings, and also maybe the Royal 
Academy as well. 
NL: Versace always has crazy shit [at the Royal 
Academy] like half a cow in a glass case and every-
one stands around and says, hmm. ... But all the 
galleries and all the museums are free, so in terms 
of cultural stuff to do during the day, it’s second 
to none in terms of cities — like you go to New 
York and its like 10 dollars here, 10 dollars there. 
London, walk up — free.

... The London theater scene and music scene is 
amazing, and you can get really cheap tickets if you 
go on standby. You turn up at the theater half an 
hour before the play and if someone’s on standby, 
you can get cheap tickets.

... Going to the pub doesn’t have to be expen-
sive. In areas outside Leicester Square, in places like 
Camden market, you can get cheap, cheap pints. 
KD: If you’re a student, just crash some student 
union and take advantage of their pound a pint 

EAP SUCCESS STORY
REPORTS FROM NEW 
ZEALAND’S CAPITAL

caution: When it’s your turn to order, tag behind 
a gruff Polish man with a hearty appetite and 
point at his plate — nobody will speak English 
and milk-bar waitresses are just as unforgiving 
as you are incoherent.)

While a night train comes with cramped 
beds and pickpockets — sleep with your pass-
port in your pants — it’s a quick and affordable 
way to reach the nation’s capital, Warsaw, and 
see its famous royal castle. 

Continue your trek down south to end up in 
Krakow, Poland’s bustling 20-something hotspot. 
Home to an ancient Jewish Quarter and a slew 
of pretty churches, the city offers daily commu-
nism tours and is just a two-hour bus ride from 
Auschwitz, enough to quench your waning col-
lege-kid intellectualism before boozing it all away 
come sundown. Don’t skip out on the drinks — 
make sure to taste Żubrówka, bison-grass vodka 
that mixes well with apple juice, and Krupnik, a 
tasty honey-based liquor. And if you pull up next 
to a couple locals, order a shot, raise your glass 
and say, “Na zdrowie!” (“To your health!”), you’re 
sure to hook a free guide for day two.

night on Thursdays. Best time to go when it 
comes to cheap drinks. 
NL: In South London, for cheap curry, the Mirch 
Masala in Tooting is the best place in the world. 
But it’s my favorite place — its really, really, really 
cheap and all the kind of local community always 
goes there and everyone in there is Indian fami-
lies or of Indian decent so the food’s good. It’s legit 
— that’s what people say? — it’s hella legit. 

... The most magnificent organization ever 
made was www.megabus.com. It’s coaches, I think 
they’re out of use and they maybe didn’t deposit 
their safety checks or something ’cause they’re 
horrible, but you can get really cheap fares. You 

can get from London to Glasgow on the megabus 
overnight for 12 pounds and it takes all night and 
it’s horrible, but it’s the best thing ever. 
KD: It might be best to go end of August. That’s 
the only time you’re pretty much guaranteed 
decent weather in UK. 
NL: A horrible cloudy day here is the best you’ll 
get in England.
KD: That’s the other thing I recommend: Always 
carry an umbrella. Don’t listen to the weather 
people; they always lie. 
NL: Ahh Dash, I miss England.
KD: Thing is, as soon as we step off the plane 
we’re going to be like, “Fuck this — I’m going 
back to California.”

AUSSIES LET THEIR HAIR 
DOWN FOR A HOLY VISITOR
By Allie Cuerdo
Senior Staff Writer

I
talians in sky-blue capes, Brazilians in green 
soccer jerseys, Orange County kids in neon 
orange sweaters — World Youth Day 2008 in 
Sydney was a mass of color-splashed patri-
otism from around the globe. Flags from 

countless countries rippled in the cool, crisp air. 
Backpack-carrying pilgrims streamed through 
the gridlocked streets. Chants of “Bene, Bene, 
Bene!” drove young Catholics on toward Randwick 
Racecourse, where the Papal Mass would be held. 
The push to see Pope Benedict XVI drew over 
250,000 campers to an overnight vigil, dubbed 
“Holy Night” in newspaper headlines the next day. 

A week and multiple cleaning crews later, the 
city resumed its laid-back, San Francisco-esque 
lifestyle. Slicked-back suits and secretaries in four-
inch heels strolled to the Pitt Street sky malls for $5 
espresso. Teenagers scoured George Street for sales 
on lace vests and bellbottoms. Train stops burst with 
food: fresh croissants, sushi rolls, Turkish kebabs 
and Indian takeout. 

Indie-licious, plaid-clad couples congregated in 
the Museum of Modern Art. The free exhibit fea-
tured four floors of social commentary, including 
Jesus nailed to a rocket ship, a roomful of colored 
hammocks and roaring Hendrix and a stack of 
“Fahrenheit 451”s printed backwards. The accom-
panying Biennale of Sydney brought over 180 art-
ists to Cockatoo Island, the Aussie take on SF’s 
Alcatraz Island. Installations found new life in the 
original brick prisons. Filmed communist messages, 
screaming shadowy soundtracks, wall-size charcoal 
sketches — all communicated a wild, sprawling 
urgency underneath the professional city scene.

Other, more usual haunts — the Royal Botanic 
Gardens, the Sydney Opera House, Darling 
Harbour — couldn’t compare. At its heart, Sydney 
was less monuments and more masses. It welcomed 
the foreign pilgrim and the pierced native, both 
clenching cheap meat pies and searching the streets 
for the next great night.

Katie Dash (left) and Natasha Lewis-Smith are studying abroad for a year at UCSD before returning to their home city of London.

scotland
KD: Go to Scotland. Go to Edinburgh, but if you’re looking for a club scene in Scotland, go to Glasgow.

I’ve been living in Scotland for two years.
When I move my stuff up it’s such a good drive. 
I would tell someone to drive from London to 
Edinburgh, but it’s kind of long and everyone 
drives crazy. But I would recommend driv-
ing at least from Lake District, from there to 
Scotland and then to Edinburgh, because you 
skim Glasgow on the way. From Glasgow to 
Edinburgh is just these windy roads and it’s 
just amazing the views — it’s like no other, it’s 
nothing like I’ve ever seen.

You can get to the cafe where J.K. 
Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter. That’s 
in Edinburgh. There’s this private school, 
Edinburgh University, where she got the 
inspiration for Harry Potter and it’s actually 
amazing. Some of their schools there — they 
just look like castles. It’s amazing.

The Archers [has] good music, really great 
drum and bass line. I’ve only been there once, 
but everyone recommends it. It’s on the main 
street. They basically have this pedestrianized 
area in Glasgow — they’ve got better shop-
ping than in Edinburgh, but a lot of people 
don’t go to Glasgow ’cause it’s quite rough and 
grim, but it’s quite a beautiful city.

It might be worthwhile taking a trip to St. 
Andrews as well. It’s full of Americans, to be 
honest. But, people feel at home. There’s noth-
ing there except nice buildings, pretty much.

Short Cuts: Sea in the blood - This new 
weekly series will feature short films (from 5 
to 30min), free coffee/snacks, and discussion 
for graduate students. Sea in the blood is 
essayist and filmmaker Richard Fung’s per-
sonal documentary on living close to illness. 
Using old home movie footage from the 
’50s shot in Trinidad, England, and Canada, 
he traces his family’s encounter with a rare 
blood disease, thalassemia. Tues., Mar. 10, 
12-1pm at the Cross Cultural Center.

WEEKLY
Reversing the Lens: Representations of 
Women in Art: An art exhibit presenting 
the works of female artists on campus and 
in the local community. Throughout history, 
women have been objectified, commodified, 
and hypersexualized in art works, rendered 
as objects to be gazed at by typically male 
viewers. The purpose of this exhibition is 
to give women artists the opportunity to 
“reverse the lens,” so to speak, and give them 
the opportunity to represent themselves. 
March 2-13 at the Cross Cultural Center 
ArtSpace.

or questioning folks who are coming out and 
who may already be out. Topics are deter-
mined by group participants, and can include 
coming out to yourself, coming out to fam-
ily, coming out to friends, coming out and 
the work place, and coming out at school.

Critical Gender Studies 104
Advanced Topics in Comparative Perspectives: 
Mothers & Motherhood in America 
lecture: T 6:00 – 8:50pm
room: WLH 2209
taught by: Rebecca Plant, History Department
section id: 646699 

This course examines differing views of motherhood and maternal 
experiences from a transnational and historical perspective.  We will 
explore cultural and political meanings attributed to motherhood, and 
the ways in which the maternal role informs women's personal and 
civic identities.  In addition, we will examine differing attitudes and 
practices toward the maternal body, and how new reproductive 
technologies have affected women in different parts of the world.

The concept of ‘wilderness’ has played a central, if uniquely modern, role in American 
consciousness. Wilderness exists as a fundamental category for environmentalists, and has 
variously been the focal point of public policies, recreation, and political activism.  This 
course is a multidisciplinary survey of the evolving meanings and significance of the idea of 
wilderness in America. We will address historical, philosophical, ecological, and artistic 
approaches to the concept of wilderness.  The class will be supplemented with lectures from 
guest speakers. 

ENVR 102: Special Topics-Wilderness & Human Values
Taught by: Eric Martin
Section ID: 646761

Sections: A01: Fridays 10:00-10:50 a.m. & A02: Fridays 11:00-11:50 a.m.
Room: Half-Dome Lounge

The class will include a field component,

wilderness and the efforts of those who 
would define and preserve it.

off a 16-9 run. The Tritons pushed a 
double-digit lead. With 5:34 left in 
regulation and the Wildcats down 
50-43, Gaskin hit back-to-back buck-
ets to boost UCSD up 54-46 and pave 
the way for victory. Scoring their final 
six points in free throws, the Tritons 
went 6-for-8 from the line in the last 
minute of the game to post a win 
over Chico State 60-46 and sweep the 
season series.

“Our patience and teamwork offen-
sively makes it even more difficult 
[for our opponents] because we force 
teams to have to play defense every 
possession,” Gaskin said. “We look for 
the best shot, not for a particular per-
son.”

For the 16th time this season, Osier 
led all scores with 17 points and pulled 
down a game-high 13 boards. Carlisle 
followed with 14 points and grabbed 
eight boards while Gaskin added 11 
points and five boards. Overall, UCSD 
out-rebounded Chico State 36-21.

“We played great team defense and 
continued to make some great deci-
sions on the offensive end,” Elliott said. 
“We knew both teams would be play-
ing with a lot of emotion due to Senior 
Night and yet, we remained calm and 
confident and allowed our defense to 
create our offense, which led to some 
easy baskets in transition.”

bmlee@ucsd.edu.

tunity with Division-I money, Elliott 
swooped in, immediately winning her 
team over. At the start of last sea-
son, senior forward Michelle Osier 
said Elliott had a different (i.e. better) 
philosophy than their old coach and 
allowed players to snag improbable 
victories, giving them new excitement 
and hope. Now in Elliott’s second sea-
son, the Tritons have her defensive 
style — a mix of man-to-man and 
zone — down pat. Her coaching staff ’s 
amazing recruiting, which brought 
freshman sensation Chelsea Carlisle 
and her explosive offense to UCSD, 
can’t be overlooked either.

2. Unlike their 2006-07 counter-
parts, these Tritons don’t rely on any 
single player to execute offensively. 
Two seasons ago, the Tritons belonged 
to then senior Leora Juster in all her 
crazy-haired glory. The 5-foot-8-inch 

guard completely obliterated almost 
all the CCAA competition — she led 
the Tritons in scoring for 14 of their 
19 conference games — scoring over 
30 points several times. Not surpris-
ingly, Juster recorded a below-average 
12 points in the Tritons’ semifinal loss. 
Even though Osier is unquestionably 
the Tritons’ best player, she’s only led 
UCSD’s scoring in half of its CCAA 
games, with five other Tritons having 
led at some point. More importantly, 
the Tritons can put together wins even 
without Osier’s double-digits.

3. Senior center Alexis Gaskin’s 
decision to stay at UCSD for a fifth 
year gave the Tritons a dominant scor-
ing threat in the paint that they lacked 
two years ago. With Gaskin in the 
middle, other teams become distract-
ed, allowing Triton scorers to get open. 
Look for Gaskin to be the difference 
maker in the playoffs.

in the game. After two Warrior free 
throws reduced the visitor lead to 
eight, another Acevedo three-pointer 
kicked off an 8-0 UCSD run.

Cal State Stanislaus cut the Triton 
lead to single digits again following 
a quick 6-0 run of its own that made 
the score 60-51. This time, the Triton 
response was one of the season’s 
most ferocious. In less than five min-
utes, UCSD scored 20 points, allow-
ing only a layup and one free throw 
from the opposition. Poppen’s dunk 
and Acevedo’s seventh three-pointer 
placed a fitting exclamation point on 
the effort, putting the Tritons ahead 
by 26.

“What we really did a good job 
of was a simple concept — just pass-
ing and catching,” Carlson said. “We 
found the open guy, made the extra 
pass.”

The 98 points marked UCSD’s 
highest offensive output since last sea-
son’s triple overtime game at Cal State 
Los Angeles. The margin of victory 
was also the program’s largest since 
the 2005-06 season.

“We ended the regular season off 
on a really good note,” Kim said. 
“The biggest thing [prior to Tuesday 
night’s meeting with Humboldt] is 
just being ready for the game. Coming 
in focused, playing with a sense of 
urgency, knowing that it’s do-or-die 
from here on out. Just keep that on 
our mind and hopefully use that as 
motivation for the next few games.”

Acevedo led all scorers with 
a career-high 23 points on 7-of-10 
three-point shooting. As a team, the 
Tritons finished with their highest 
shooting percentage of the season, 
55.9 percent from the field, after 
shooting an astonishing 78.1 percent 
(25-for-32) in the second half. Cal 
State Stanislaus was held to below 40 
percent from the field, committed 17 

turnovers and was out-rebounded, 
39-27.

The Tritons also secured an early 
lead on Thursday night at Chico State, 
scoring seven of the first nine points 
in the game. After a layup by Chico 
State’s Andy Bocian, the CCAA’s lead-
ing scorer, UCSD went on a 7-0 run 
to take its biggest lead of the game 
at nine with less than 10 minutes left 
in the first half. The Tritons main-
tained a lead through the rest of the 
half, until a three-point play by the 
Wildcats with six seconds remaining 
tied the score at 24 heading into the 
break.

UCSD was unable to extend its 
advantage over the Wildcats early 
in the second period, never grab-
bing a double-digit lead. Chico State 
stunned the Tritons with a 10-0 run 
to end the game. UCSD committed 
three turnovers in the final three min-
utes, settling for a split in the season 
series with the Wildcats.

“The last three minutes, we just 
didn’t get things done, and [Chico 
State] did,” Carlson said. “We missed 
open shots close to the basket. We 
didn’t finish plays very well, and they 
did.”

Poppen and Lawley each scored 16 
points, with Poppen adding a game-
high 12 rebounds. 

With the regular season finished, 
the Tritons now turn their attention to 
their first playoff opponent. 

“We’ve got our hands full on 
Tuesday,” Carlson said. “We expect 
to have really good preparation head-
ing into Tuesday because we’re play-
ing a very, very good opponent in 
Humboldt ... I always feel like if we 
do a good job defending, rebounding 
and taking care of the ball, I like our 
chances.”

The 49ers tied the game at six early 
in the fourth, using their defensive 
momentum to seize control of the 
game. Long Beach State found the 
back of the net twice during the 
final 90 seconds to cement a come-
from-behind 8-6 victory.

“We just need to focus on some 
of the mistakes we made and try to 
prevent them for next time,” head 
coach Larry Sanders said.

The Tritons played well offen-
sively through the first half against 
UC Irvine on Friday night. Although 
the Anteaters took an early lead, the 
Tritons struck back when senior 
attacker Sydney Gstettenbauer 
scored early in the second to tie the 
game at four. The teams went back 
and forth the rest of the quarter, but 
it was Irvine that went into inter-
mission with a two-point advantage.

“They just capitalized on some 
opportunities, especially in the sec-
ond half and we didn’t,” Sanders 
said. We didn’t take care of the ball.”

The Tritons were nearly blown 
out in the third quarter, as the 
Anteaters scored four straight goals 
to start, before freshman hole set 
Kirsten Bates scored her lone goal 
of the match. Still, the Tritons found 
themselves trailing 14-7 early in the 
fourth, and were unable to find the 
back of the net past the five minute 
mark when Gstettenbauer made it 
14-8.

Trying to shake off their tough 
string of losses, the Tritons head to 
Santa Barbara next weekend where 
they will be competing in the UCSB 
invitational tournament.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Riding 
a wave of success for nearly the entire 
season, the ninth ranked women’s 
basketball team concluded its regu-
lar season as expected — with vic-
tories over Chico State on Feb. 26 
and Cal State Stanislaus on Feb. 27. 
The Tritons’ record stands at 26-3 and 
19-1 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. UCSD’s mark in con-
ference play is the program’s best since 
the Tritons joined the conference nine 
years ago.

The top seeded Tritons will now 
host eighth seeded Cal State San 
Bernardino in the first round of the 
CCAA Championship Tournament at 
5:30 p.m. on March 3. 

“We are thrilled to be hosting 
Tuesday night and what a tremendous 
accomplishment for UCSD to have 
both the men and women hosting a 
tournament game,” Elliott said. “It’s 
tournament time, which means every-
one will be at their best, and I think 
our players are pretty excited to have 
another chance at San Bernardino.”

The Coyotes, who the Tritons last 
faced on Feb.14, were the only team to 
defeat UCSD in conference play this 
season — handing UCSD a 64-59 loss 
at home. 

“This week is definitely a time for 
rematches — San Bernardino was our 
only loss so we’re looking for revenge,” 
senior center Alexis Gaskin said. “But 
it is also important for us because 
we want to get the best position for 
regionals ... We know with all our 
offensive and defensive weapons, we’re 
going to be hard to stop not just on 
Tuesday, but all the way through the 
postseason.”

Despite securing the No. 1 CCAA 
seed the previous weekend, the Tritons 
executed an early, unshakeable lead 
against Cal State Stanislaus to demol-
ish the Warriors seven minutes into 
the first half. Holding a 20-8 advan-
tage with 13:13 on the clock, back-
to-back threes and a jumper by Cal 
State Stanislaus trimmed UCSD’s lead 
down to four. Then, Gaskin knocked 
in a jumper. Junior guard Annette 
Ilg nailed her second triple. And the 
Tritons were up and running again, 
maintaining a 13-point lead at the 
end of the half. An exceptional Triton 
defense was displayed Friday night, 
forcing numerous Warrior turnovers 
and resulting in 23 points for UCSD.

“We have trust in each other that 
we have help if they try to go back 
door, so we’re getting stops and steals 

frequently because it’s tough for any-
one to have to consistently fight for 
every basket,” Gaskin said.

Outscoring Cal State Stanislaus 
30-11 for the first 10 minutes of the 
second half, senior forward Michelle 
Osier’s three-point play gave UCSD a 
32-point cushion, making it the game’s 
largest lead at 70-38. Stanislaus came 
no closer than 19 for the rest of the 
contest before the Tritons sailed to a 
76-57 victory.

Freshman guard Chelsea Carlisle 
turned in another solid performance, 
leading the team with 20 points, hit-
ting 8-of-10 from the field and tallying 
four rebounds and four steals. Gaskin 
finished with 15 points while Ilg added 
13 points, going a perfect 3-for-3 from 
behind the arc. 

The prior evening, UCSD domi-

nated. The team used a command-
ing second period to defeat Chico 
State 60-46. In a seesaw first half, the 
score was tied nine times with six 
lead changes. Carlisle knocked down 
a triple to tie the score at 23 with two 
minutes left. The Tritons then scored 
six unanswered points, clutching onto 
a delicate lead of 29-23 entering half-
time.

Stretching the lead to nine early 
in the second half, the Wildcats 
responded with consecutive layups 
and a pair of free throws, whittling 
their deficit to 32-29 with 16:08 on 
the clock. Over the next several min-
utes, the Tritons maintained a slim 
advantage before junior forward 
Kristen Cabral’s three pointer capped

The UCSD women’s basketball team has the opportunity to emerge from the madness of 
March very, very happy. Sweeping 
their final weekend, the No. 9 Tritons 
enter their first postseason game 
against Cal State San Bernardino 
poised for a historic playoff drive.

With their last two wins, the 
Tritons secured the program’s best 
conference record (19-1) since enter-
ing the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. But success is nothing 
new for the women’s basketball pro-
gram. Two seasons ago, the Tritons 
earned an NCAA Division-II tour-

nament bid, eventually falling in the 
Final Four — one game short of the 
National Championship match.

As great a team as that was, the 
2008-09 Tritons are even better. And 
considering that a slightly improved 
version of the historic Final Four 
team would probably have given 
RIMAC Arena another big, blue 
championship banner to add to its 
collection, this team is the real deal. 
With only two players remaining 
from that 2006-07 team, how could 
the Tritons have possibly rebuilt 
their squad to be stronger than the 
school’s best ever in just two years? 
Here are the top three reasons why 
the Tritons have an even better shot 
at a National Championship this sea-
son.

1. Head coach Charity Elliott is 
ridiculously good at what she does. 
After former Triton head coach Janell 
Jones peaced out on the team she 
had just taken to the Final Four in 
order to pursue a Division-I oppor-

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The Tritons 
earned one final home game of the 
season after defeating Cal State 
Stanislaus on Feb. 27 and enter post-
season play  as the fourth seed in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. UCSD’s win on Friday 
was a huge improvement from the 
57-60 loss to Chico State on Feb. 
26. The 98-68 victory over Cal State 
Stanislaus gave the Tritons an over-
all record of 16-10 and a conference 
mark of 13-7, allowing a team with 
seven senior players one more chance 
to play at home.

“[Home court] was one of the goals 
we set for ourselves back in the first 
game of the year,” head coach Chris 
Carslon. “We’ve worked hard enough 
and played hard enough throughout 
the year to earn that opportunity.”

The Tritons will face Humboldt 
State on March 3 at RIMAC Arena 
in the first round of the CCAA 
Championship Tournament. The win 
over Cal State Stanislaus will give the 
program its first home playoff game at 
the Division-II level.

“I think it’s great — there’s noth-
ing more we can ask for, just putting 
ourselves in this position to play one 
more at home,” senior guard Kelvin 
Kim said. “It’d be great if we can have 
a win in our last home game to send 

it off right.”
Carlson’s squad put together 

a less-than-stellar first half at Cal 
State Stanislaus, shooting 29.6 per-
cent from the field during the open-
ing 20 minutes. UCSD held a six-
point advantage, its biggest lead of 
the first half, after a layup by senior 
forward Shane Poppen at the 13:42 
mark. Unfortunately, the Tritons 
did not convert another field goal 
for over six minutes as the Warriors 
rolled off a 14-2 run. Junior guard 
Tyler Acevedo ended the dry spell 
with a three-pointer to pull the team 
to within three. Acevedo was just 
heating up, connecting on two more 
three-pointers — his third and fourth 
of the opening half — on consecutive 
possessions around the two-minute 
mark. His fourth three-pointer, off 
an assist from junior guard Jordan 
Lawley, gave the Tritons a two-point 
advantage they were able to maintain, 
heading into the break 30-28.

“We were playing down to their 
level,” Kim said. “I don’t think we were 
ready to play.”

UCSD came out ready in the 
second half, turning its two-point 
lead into a double-digit advantage. 
UCSD scored the first seven points 
and senior center A.J. Maulhardt put 
in back-to-back layups, giving the 
Tritons a 44-32 lead with 16:35 left

WATER POLO — The 18th ranked 
Tritons fell on hard times last week-
end, succumbing to 10th ranked 
UC Irvine on Feb. 27 and 16th 
ranked Long Beach State on Feb. 
28 at home. Despite two strong first 
halves, the Tritons fell to 3-9 on the 
season and saw their losing streak 
extend to six.

Following their loss to the 
Anteaters, the Tritons returned to 
the pool against the 49ers. UCSD 
struck early, exchanging goals with 
the 49ers through the first half in 
a tough match between two evenly 
matched teams. The teams went into 
intermission with nothing separat-
ing them, and the score tied at three.

“We knew we needed a win com-
ing out of [the UC Irvine] game, 
and we knew we could win,” junior 
utility Stephanie Bocian said. 

The Tritons came out strong 
in the second half, as sophomore 
attacker Hanalei Crowell struck first 
for the Tritons. Long Beach State 
responded with a goal quickly, but 
the Tritons clearly dominated the 
third quarter, scoring two more 
while playing nearly flawless defen-
sively. The Tritons looked good with 
a fourth quarter lead of 6-4 but were 
unable to build on the lead as the 
49ers defense held strong, shutting 
out the Tritons the rest of the way.
