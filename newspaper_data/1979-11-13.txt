About 75 students marched on the 
chancellor's search committee yesterday, 
demanding the resignation of Bill Byrd as EOP 
director and an investigation of university minority 
recruiting policies. 

The students, most members of the Student 
Affirmative Action organizations, gathered on the

chancellor's complex, where a committee of faculty, 
students and regents were meeting to hear campus 
ideas on what kind of chancellor UCSD should get to 
replace William McElroy, who leaves in June. 

"Let's pick up those picket signs and quietly march 
over to McElroy's office right now. Let's rally 
together and let them know where it's at," MEChA 
Treasurer Conrado Gerardo said. 

Once at the meeting, the demonstrators paraded 
around Conference Room 111 A chanting slogans 
and waving picket signs. 

Attempts to meet with committee members were 
rebuffed, and university police eventually took guard 
positions at every entranCe to the conference room. 

Reaction to the demonstrators inside the meeting 
was described by most members as calm. 

"I didn't care one way or another about the 
demonstration. We weren't even talking abQut that," 
one committee member said. 

DeWitt Higgs, San Diego regent, said "I don't 
think they changed anyone's mind." 

But Diego Catalan, part of a faculty group that 
met with the search committee, said the committee 
had been talking about the composition of the faculty 
group when interrupted by the demonstration. 

Only one person of color was part of that group, he 
said. 

Vice Chancellor .of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage followed the rally to the administration 
complex, and stopped just short of endorsing the 
demands of SAAC leaders. 

"You have not made any demand that is 
unreasonable and that ought not to be addressed,"

UCSD's Iranians Will Stay Quiet 
By John Klock 

Iranian students will be keeping 
a low profile here, at least for a 
while, interviews with the campus 
Iranian community show. 

But two members of the Iranian 
Moslem Students Association say 
Iranians have a responsibility to 
convey to the Am,erican people the 
message that there is no conflict 

between Iranians and Americans, 
and, they say, never has been. 

"It has always been that the 
Iranian people are eager to save 
their solidarity and friendship with 
the American people. 

"Behind all this (recent turmoil) 
is the long time support by the 
American government of the 
unpopular re5{ime of the shah," 

one exchange student says. 
Shouts of "Death to the US" 

have been interpreted as anti-
American sentiment, they say, 
when it really was anti -US 
government propaganda . 

Although that explanation is not 
offered by all Iranians here, there is 
no denying the eruption of hostility 
towards them by American . And 
for now, there will be few attempts 
to take their case to the Ameri an 
public. 

(Please turn to page 8) 

Armitage said. He then offered to carry demand. of 
the group into the search committee meeting. 

After a quick huddle, SAAC declined. 
"We think we can present the demands 

our.dves," Gerard9 said. 
University police declined to let the demonstraton 

pass, but a McElroy assistant eventually got a note 
indoors. 

There were six SAAC demands 
A student EOP advisory committee, support for 

the Third College numerical goal., the resignation 01 
Byrd as Educational Opportunity Program Director, 
minority representation on the EOP staff and an 
investigation of campus affirmative action 
procedures b~ civil rights authorities. 

MEChA, Gerardo said, has already successfully 
filed ten complaints against the university alleging 
civil rights violations. 

Wilma Martinez, the only non-white search 
committee member, talked to the demonstrators after 
the meeting, telling them they should present their 
demands to the committee as a whole, which held an 
open session at 4:45 yesterday evening. 

Gerardo, who led the protestors, went to that open 
meeting and adch-essed those Regents , faculty and 
students still in attendance, telling them the university 
must listen to SAAC's demands and improve its 
minority recruiting mechanisms. 

Finally, Gerardo and Black Student Union leader 
Robert T ambuzi got a chance to talk with university 
President David Saxon, who told them he "had no 
problem with numerical goals," but didn't know 
enough about UCSD's problems to elaborate. 

Saxon added, "I'm not sure they should have been 
demonstrating here. They might have had better luck 
across the way, at the vice chancellor's office." 

The EOP program, around which most of 
SAAC's demands are centered, is responsible to 
Harold Temmer in the Office of Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs. 

Temmer, however, was out of town. 
Byrd, his secretary said, was tied up in an 

offcampus meeting most of the afternoon and was 
also unavailable for comment. 

SAAC Demands at Yesterday's Rally 
1. That the administration support actively 

the formation of a student EOP Advisory 
Committee. 

2. That the administration support numerical 
goals for the entire university. 

3. That the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee (SAAC) be supported in the effort 
to widen the scope of its advisory capacity. 

4. The resignation of Bill Byrd, and the 
reopening of his personnel file ... 

5. That the staff of EOP be reflective of the 
Third World constituency here on campus. 
This would necessarily include a Native 
American and Asian American recruiter on 
staff. 

6. That this univer ity open itself to a 
univer ity wide investigation of affirmative 
action practi Ii and inadequacies via th Civil 
Right D partment.

Iranian Scapegoats 
Most reasonable people were undoubtedly offended 

by the attacks on Iranians in Bever Iy Hills last week. 
Americans are understandably frustrated by the 
seizure of the American embassy in Tehran, but it is 

wr~g to blame Iranians who are living and studying in 
the US for the actions of the Ayatollah Khomeini and 
the militant students who are holding 60 Americans 
hostage. 

The Dally Guardian Tu .... " November 13, ~879 

It was especially disturbing to see a minor outbreak 
of anti-Iranian sentiment at UCSD when a handful of 
students burned a makeshift Iranian flag in the Revelle 
plaza. The students did not specifically criticize 
Iranians living in the US, but once people give way to 
xenophobia it becomes easier to lash out at the people 
who represent the nation against whom anger is 
directed. 

8obots Replace Workers 

And so far Iranians in the US, in spite of their 
varying attitudes about what is happening in their 
country, have been the sole direct recipients of 
Americans' wrath. Some, eager to explain why they 
believe the exiled Shah should be returned to Iran, 
have fueled Americans' anger themselves (the UC 

- Student Lobby has consequently urged Iranian 
students to exercise "restraint"), but many others are' 
quietly trying to continue their studies and their lives. 

President Carter, playing one of the few strategic 
cards he holds in this crisis, has ordered the Justice 
department to begin the process by which all Iranians 
in the country on visas wiD be required to register on 
campuses or at immigration offices. Carter is probably 
hoping his move, which officials say wiD not result in 
any immediate deportations, . will help channel 
Americans' frustration and keep demonstrators off the 
streets. He fears more demonstrations could further 
endanger the hostages. 

But Carter's order will have the additional effect of 
focusing more adverse attention on Iranians, students 
and otherwise, in the US, who are already reporting 
hate calls and insults. It is up to Americans, especially 
those of us who work and live with Iranians on college 
campuses, to do our best to see that Iranians do not 
suffer harassment and discrimination because of 
events over which they have no control. 

Give and Take 

By Harley Shaiken 
The financially troubled 

Chrysler Corp ., now 
dependent on a massive 
government bail·out to protect 
the jobs of thousands of 
workers , has recently placed 
the largest single order for 
robots in US automotive 
history . 

The automaker plans to 
purchase 95 wdding robots 
worth an extimated $6 million 
for production work on the 
1981 models, according to the 
respected trade journal, 
American Metal Market. The 
robots will be employed jn the 
company's aging Jeffer~n 
Ave. assembly plant in 
Detroit, and in its Wilmington, 
Ddaware facility. 

The timing of Chrysler's 
.record order is expected to 
raise serious questions about 
the Increasing trend toward 
automation in the automotive 
industry . Ironically, the 
company has just received 
more than $400 malion in 
wage and benefit concessions 
from the United Auto 
Workers, and is requesting an 
additional $750 million in loan 
guarantees from the 
government. 

With more than 30,000

of automation at Chrysler and 
other companies claim that the 
introduction of labor· saving 
machinery is intended to 
reduce employment. In the 
current economic and 
employment situation at 
Chrysler, they also point to the 
much higher initial cost of the 
equipment over hand held 

welding guns, and the fact that 
other manufacturers currently 
'maintain satisfactory quality 
without the use of robots. 
Volkswagen, for example, is 
not using robots in its brand 
new plant in New Stanton, 
Penn. 

However, even critics agree 
that the potential COlt savings 
represented by industrial 
robots is impressive. The use 
of a robotic system over a two· 
year period at a Volvo plant in. 
Sweden, utilizing 27 Unimate 
robots and rdated equipment, 
was expected to reduce the 
work force of 67 to seven. The 
payback period for the 
equipment, in terms .of saved 
salaries, was expected to be 
about two years, 'according to 
the company. 

If the same ratio ofrobot& to 
displaced workers held true at 
Chrysler, the 95 Unimate 
robots would reduce the work 
force by between 200 and 
400, on a two·shift basis, 
depending on a number of 
variables. 

The new generation of 
robots is becoming increasing. 

Iy cost competitive dwith 
autoworkers. A robot that 
initially costs $40,000 
represents an hourly cost of 
$4.80 when the purchase 
price and maintenance costs 
are spread over the expected 
eight·year life of the robot. 
This compares favorably with 
the current hourly cost of more 
than $15 an hour, including 
benefits, for some assemblers 
in the auto industry. Robots 
will not share in the recently 
negotiated retirement benefits, 
nor dip into Chrysler's 
supplemental unemployment 
funds. 

But the introduction of the 
new technology poses a 
dilemma for the UA W. "We 
continue to not oppose the 
introduction of new technol-
ogy, understanding that the 
productivity improvements 
are the basis 01 rising wages 
and benefits," said one UAW 
source close to the Chrysler 
bargaining. 

HistoricaUy, the union has 
not opposed the elimination of 
hazardous or unhealthy jobs, 
providing no direct unem· 
ployment occurs. In this case, 
however, it is difficult to see 
how the displaced workers 
could be absorbed, given the 
current state of the ,company. 

Some Chrysler workers 
interviewed expres~ed anger 
and shock at the reported 
order. "I have a basic problem 
with it because we're asking 
our workers to sacrifice and 
part of that sacrifice is being 
used to put more people out of 
work," said Dennis Czuchaj, 
vice president of the UA Ws

Americans Killed? No Iranian Oil Odd-Even is Back 

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - Six Americans 
and two Australian yachtsmen were captured, 
tortured and executed in 1978 by the former Pol Pot 
regi me , reporters accompanying US 
congresswomen on a tour of Phnom Penh were told 
yesterday. . 

Cambodian officials did not identify the yachtsmen 
a nd their report could not be verified independently. 
They said all eight victims were captured sailing off 
the Cambodian coast, but it was not clear if they were 
captured together . The Americans, at least , were 
accused of being spies, they said. 

The officials took the reporters to Phnom Penh's 
T uol Slaeng prison, where the executions allegedly 
took place. They said the Pol Pot regime executed 
more than 20,000 people at the prison. 

The regime now in power in Cambodia ws installed 
by the Vietnamese troops who ousted Pol Pot last 
January. The current regime still is engaged in 
bloody fighting with loyalist forces . 

Times Returns 
LONDON - The Times of London was back opn 

the streets last night after an 11112-month shutdown 
caused by labor disputes . 

The return of the 194·year·old newspaper, which 
had never ceased publication before, was delayed by 
a last· minute hitch - a dispute between two print 
unions over who would press the start button on the 
presses. Union leaders worked out a temporary 
settlement and the presses rolled. 

The first edition, No. 60,473, was on the streets 
soon after 10:15 pm, about 40 minutes behind 
schedule. 

Editor William Rees.Mogg said the initial print run 
was ' 400,000 ' copies - 100,000 more than The 
Times' pre·shutdown circulation. 

WASHINGTON - President Carter halted oil 
imports from Iran yesterday, declaring that America 
will not bow to economic pressure or terrorism it its' 
efforts to protect "the lives of our people" held 
hostage atlhe U.S. Embassy in Tehran. 

Carter said he was cutting off Iraman oil imports, 
which account for at least 4 percent of daily 
American consumption , "to eliminate any 
suggestion that economic pressures can weaken our 
stand on basic issues of principle. " " 

He said the Iranians who have held the embassy 
and 60 American hostages since Nov. 4 are trying 
"to force unacceptable demands on our country." 

The students occupying the embassy have 
demanded that the Unted States surrender the 
deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi for trial as 
a war criminal. The shah is hospitalized in New York 
for cancer treatment. 

The president said it is vial to the United States and 
the world that diplomatic personnel be protected, 
"and that we refuse to permit the use of terrorism 
and the seizure and holding of hostages to impose 
political demands." 

May Cause Shortage 
WASHINGTON - Energy policy makers are 

uncertain how President ·Carter's decision to halt 
purchases of Iranian oil will affect American 
consumers , but they say it is possible oil supplies will 
decli e by about 4 percent to 8 percent. 
That could be enough to trigger long gasoline lines 
again. However, it would be far short of the 20 
percent shortage that would trigger gasoline 
rationing under recently passed legislation. 

Administration officials, who asked not to be 
named , said Americans can compensate fot the 
cutoff in Iranian oil by reducing their average 
automobile travel by three miles daily. 

LOS ANGELES - Gov. Edmund G, Brown Jr. 
announced yesterday that California will go back to 
an odd·even gasoline rationing program which will be 
extended state·wide. 

Brown also said he supports President Carter's 
announcement earlier in the day that the United 
States will import no more oil from Iran. 

Brown, who announced his presidential candidacy 
last week. said he stands behind Carter's action and 
won't try to second guess the p'resident while 60 
Americans are still being held hostage at the US 
Embassy in Tehran. 

Last spring, 14 of the largest of California's 58 
co::nties began odd·even rationing after gas 
shortages caused lengthy lines at service stations. 

But one by one, all those counties have discarded 
the plan. The plan provides that cars with license 
plates ending in odd numbers can buy gas on odd· 
numbered dates and vice versa. 

San Onofre Slipup 
SAN FRANCISCO - The head of the California 

Coastal Commission yesterday blasted two Southern 
California utilities for inadequately monitoring 
discharge into the ocean from the San Onofre nuclear 
power plant. 

"I'm confounded that they didn't have a proper 
monitoring program," said Michael Fischer, 
executive director. "The credibility of the nuclear 
industry is so much at stake these days." 

The Marine Review Committee recently 
recommended that Southern California Edison and 
San Diego Gas & fJectric set up, in Fischer's words, 
"a tough, fully independent monitoring program" for 
the San Diego County power plant's Unit I. 

The committee caUed the utilities to task for having 
samples of ocean water tested by a consultant who 
reported to the utilities.

Drift Chamber Detector Built for PEP 
By Lisa Pieropan 

UCSD .aentiau are working at the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center to complete a apecially 
designed detector for the world's latest experiment in 
particle physica. 

The detector, called a drift chamber, is being 
designed and built by UCSD phr.sicist& as part of the 
Positron Electron Project (PEP). It will be 
incorporated into the particle accelerator at SLAC to 
determine the compo4tion of atoms through 
controlled collisions. 

According to Dr. George Masek, UCSD physicist 
and spokesman for the project, a group of electrons is 
slammed into a special target area so that positrons 
(anti.electrons) are released. These electrons and 
positrons are then accelerated and separated. Large 
magneu accurately steer the positrons and electrons 
in opposite directions in a circular ring, and cause 
them to collide in eight specific areal. The areas 
where the colliaions occur are the drift chambers. 

There are two kinds of collisions that occur in the 
drift chambers, says Masek. The annihilation 

reaction where the electrons and positrons disappear, 
and the two photon reaction which is being studied. 
Electrons and positrons glance off of each other, 
break up, and leave excited matter. As this excited 
matter decays from each positron and electron, it 
interacts and fuels the other's electric field. This 
radiates photons, or gamma rays. 

The drift chambers will analyze the photons or 
electromagnetic energy, as well as the numerous 
other particles thought to compose an atom. The 
possibilities of quarks, the ultimate building blocks of 
all matter, and gluons, the "strong force" holding 
quarks together, will also be under scrutiny. 

"We have been theoretically studying the particle 
make up of the atom using this method for the last 
four years. It wasn't until the advent of PEP with its 
high amount of energy that the experiment could be 
possible," says Masek. 

The energy required for PEf> is 30 billion electron 
volts, which is much more than the seven billion 
electron volts used for a similar experiment in 1976 
at SLAC, according to Masek. The greater amount 

of energy can produce a much larger amount of 
considerably more accurate data, that couldn't be 
obtained in the earlier experiment, he says. 

The planning and building for the $3.5 million 
PEP project has been under ·way for almost three 
years, and approximately 90 percent of the 

in~trumentation has been completed. If plans go 
according to schedule, says Masek, the actual 
collisions will begin in a year. "We will be running the 
actual project for two years , but the data itself ·will 
take many years to analyze. We're still looking at 
data from our earlier 1976 experiment," ne says. 

The achievable results of PEP have been dimmed 
somewhat by the advent of PETRA 18 months 
earlier. PETRA, the German couriterpart of PEP, is 
using the same size particle accelerator but has not 
yet published any unknown data, according to 
Masek. 

"PETRA is taking an approach along the same 
lines as us," he says. We think perhaps we can get a 
better intensity, and we're hoping to see a few things 
that PETRA won't see." 

Early Detection for Rare Genetic Killer 
IS)' Bill Averill 

Researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine 
have developed a method for detecting a rare 
incurable hereditary disease that is uaually fatal in the 
firat daya of chadhood. 

Thia new test involves chemical analysis of the 
amniotic Ouid, surrounding the fetus, to detect the 
disease propionic acidemia, according to Dr. 
Laurence Sweetman, a researcher and spokesman 
for this project. 

Propionic acidemia is a rare recessive hereditary 
defect which i. often fatal to those afflicted. 

Thil method, which can be completed in 48 hour. 
or less, il used to detect abnormally high quantities of 
a chemical called methyl citrate. 

The new method waa firlt published last month in 
the Journal of the American Medical Association by 
Sweetman. Walter Weyler, Philip E. Young and 
William Nyhan of the UCSD School of Medicine, 
and T ourjai Shafei of Riverside General Hospital. 

Both the original method of detection and the new 

method employ the technique of amniocentesis to 
obtain a sample for study, according to Sweetman. 
This is a surgical procedure that entails withdrawing 
some of the amniotic fluid through a needle inserted 
into the uterus. The difference between the two 
detection methods, says Sweetman, is that the 
original method requires that cells present in the 
amniotic fluid be grown in cell culture which can take 
up to six weeks before tests can be completed, 
whereas with the new method the amniotic fluid itself 
can be chemically analyzed. 

The advantages of the new technique are that it is 
more rapid, so that the disease can be detected early 

_ enough to give the parents the option of a safe 
abortion, says Sweetman. It is also easier to transport 
amniotic fluid than the live cells that are required for 
the previous method of detection. 

According to Sweetman, the benefits of being able 
to detect an incurable disease like propionic acidemia 
are, firat, that if detected early enough it gives the

parents the option of aborting an affected fetus, and, 
second, that it can assure parents of having a normal 
child if the results of the test are negative. Without 
this test, parents can only be advised that if they ha ve 
previously had an affected child then statistically 
there is a one in four cnance that their next child will 
be affected. 

The assurance that an unborn child is not affected 
can eliminate some of the emotional stress of waiting 
nine months until birth to find out if a child is affected, 
and can eliminate the possibility of automatic 
abortion by couples who do not want to risk having 
another affected child, says Sweetman. 

The possibility of applying this detection method to 
other diseases is currently being studied by 
Sweetman, who predicts that similar techniques may 
prove effective in diagnosing prenatally multiple 
biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiencies. 
Individuals affected with such diseases can be treated 
with large doses of biotin (Vitamin B·12).

Catecholamines, or 
adrenalin (the name by which 
they are commonly known), 
are hormones secreted by the 
adrenal medulla, which 
stimulate the body's metabolic 
functions in preparation for 
emergency situations. 

"The reason for sheep 
(being used in the experiment) 
is that in most of the studies in 
fetal physiology and uterine 
physiology, sheep are used 
because they're very docile. 
You am study them in the 
chronic (non.anesthetized)

Chancellor Search Mulls UCSD Future 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

News Editor 

The commiuee looking for a 
new UCSD chancellor dealt 
with more than angry students 
yesterday. 

Talks with faculty, staff and 
community representatives 
dominated the groUp's day, 
which ended with a dinner at 
the La Valencia Hotel in La 
Jolla_ 

Humanities facu.llY 
members told the committee 
that they were concerned with 
UCSD's heavily sc ience -
oriented curriculum but UC 
President David Saxon said 
after the faculty meetings that 
his imprelSion was different. 

"I heard this momig that the 
humanities are strong here, 
stronger that people give them 
credit for," he said, adding that 
he wanted UCSD to be a 
wellrounded general campus. 

But Jamie Lyon, Literature 
Department chair, told the 
president, "We frankly feel 
that we (the humanities) are

stepchild. We don' t want to be

Saxon says he wants to

" I think the union should 
have a say in something like 
this," he added. . 

The robots involved bear ' 
little resemblance to their 
cousins in science fiction 
movies. Variously described 
as "metallic ostriches" or 
"steel elephant trunks," these 
robots look like giant metal 
anns sitting on a stationary 
pedestal. 

Their humble appearance, 
however, conceals one of the 
most fundamental changes in 
manufacturing technology 
since the introduction of the 
moving 'allembly line. 
T oday's industrial robots weld 
steel bodies, boal and unload 
machines, paint cars, and 
assemble small automotove 
components. Characterized 
by great f1exibmty, this potent 
new form of automation had 
been made possible by the 
revolution in microelectronics. 

'Tiny, inexpensive comput-
ers guide aU the machine 
action. When the automotive 
model changes, new 
instructions to the robot 
replace the need to inslaU 
elaborate and expensive new 
tooling. With traditional 
manufacturing technology, a 
new model often requires a 
new assembly line. With 
systems such as Chryslt ,r's,' 
needed changes may _done 
at only 10 to 1-5 percent of the 
system's initial cost. 

A recent survey conducted 
by the Society of Manufac· 
turing Engineers predicted that 
one out of very five jobs in the 
direct assembly of a car will be 
replaced by programmable 
automation by 1985, and this 
figure would rise to one out of 
every two jobs by 1995.

theater. 1be checks are aimed Another site, suggested at 

the last !Jleeting of the 
committee, is east of Regents 
Road at the baseball diamond. 
While the field offers several 
advantages, the amphitheater 
would have to be built above, 
rather than below, ground 
level, say officials. 

The diamond would not be 
more expensive to develop 
and could also serve as an 
arena for sporting events, says 
Annala. Although this multi-
purpose feature would enable 
the university to "get more for 
it's money," it may also 
detract from one of the main 
objectives of the project, which 
is to provide students "with 
one place on campus to be 
used exs:lusivelv for student 

entertainment and activities," 
she says. 

I want to see a facility in 
which top priority goes to 
student activities, whether it be 
the site near the library or the 
baseball diamond. We need a 
central place where residents 
and students without cars can 
walk to." 

One drawback to the library 
site is that it may be the 
designated location for the fifth 
college, which, Powers said 
would preclude construction of 
the amphitheater. Additional 
parking lots will also have to 
be constructed he says. 

If deciding on a place to 
build the project has been a 
complex process, finding the 

money to build it promises to 
be even more difficult. 

Powers wonders where the 
money will come from. "It will 
not be state funded and it is 
unlikely the students are going 
to access themselves the 
money." he said. 

"This is a very expensive 
project, probably as much as 
$2 million. So right now it has 
a low feasibility. Recreation 
facilities are after the same 
money and the cancer center 
has priority over any other 
project right now." 

Some of the decisions may 
be made at the next meeting of 
the planning committee, which 
Annala hopes will be before 
Thanksgiving. 

Iranian Deporta_tion Effort 
Top Priority, INS Says 

UCSD's Iranians Will Keep Quiet 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal immigration officials said 

yesterday that top priority will be~ given to locating and deporting 
Iranian students who are in the United States illegaUy. 

Verne Jervis, spokesman for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said, "This is more than a cosmetic 
effort. " 

He noted that "Nan. and mafiosos" have managd to escape 
deportation for years. "But this is not business as usual." 

A formal order will be published in the Federal Register today 
directing an estimated 50,000 Iranian students to report within 30 
days to immigration officials. Failure to report could be grounds 
for deporting them. 

Iranian students could be subject to deportation if they have 
G-opped out of school, are working without permillion, are not 
taking a full course load, lack good academic standing or have an 
expired visa. In addition, any Iranian, or any immiarant, who has 
been convicted of a crime of "moral turpitude" or one that cames 
a jail term of more than a year i~ also subject to deportation. 

(continued from page 1) 
"It wouldn't help, just stir up 

more anger. If the American 
people take time to think, they 
will fin4 the reality behind what 
. . " 
.s gomg on. . 

The most important 
element of this 'reality," 
according to almost any 
Iranian here, is that the shah is 
a criminal who should be 
returned to Iran for trial. 
Iranian students contacted 
here disagreed over the 
takeover of the American 
embassy in Tehran, and over 
the Ayatollah Khomeini's 
policies, but they agreed about 
the shah. 

"According to any law he is 
a criminal," one said. "Out of 

any two or three families in 
Iran, one will have some 
member who was executed or 
tortured or imprisoned for a 
long time during his regime. 

"Your government helped 
to return Nazis, but in is case 
you protect him," said the 
student, who asked not to be 
identified. 

The past week's violence 
has caused Iranians here "to 
evaluate the situation." 

"We need to talk to each 
other, to know how to react. It 
is too early to plan anything: 
we will wait until things cool 
If " o. 

Among the things they wiJI 
have to evaluate is a 
noticeable cooling of attitudes 

toward them on campus. The 
burning of a makeshift Iranian 
flag last Friday was the most 
obvious evidence. 

"We can feel the hatred," 
said a UCSD Iranian, who 
also asked not to be named 
because of his differences with 
other Iranians. "I wish there 
was something we could do. 
We would like a friendly 
relationship with Americans. 
But I understand how they 
feel, and I don't blame them. " 

Most of the Moslem 
association, which has about 
half of the 50 Iranian students 
on campus as members, seem 
to back Khomeini's leadership 
and policies.
