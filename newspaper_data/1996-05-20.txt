CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - A 
May 12 fire that engulfed the 
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity 
house took the lives of five 
University of North Carolina 
students. All five students . 
were· overwhelmed by stnolte 
and died of carbon-monoxide 
poisoning as they tried to 
escape the flames. The 
students were apparently 
holding a pre-graduation party, 
and four of the five victims 
had blood-alcohol levels 
above the legal driving limit. 
Three other students survived 
the blaze by jumping out of a 
second-story window. 
Investigators believe a match 
or smoldering cigarette may 
have been responsible for 
starting the fire.

Campus security officers were 
on the lookout Friday for drunken or 
belligerent behavior at the 13th-an-
nual Sun God Festival, which drew 
thousands of students and other visi-
tors to the UCSD campus. 

The official head count of par-

the total number of arrests made, 
was unavailable from the UCSI} 
Police Department at press time, 

A Warren sophomore, who did 
not wish to be named, said a Staff

SAN FRANCISCO - UC Regent Ward 
Connerly introduced and abruptly withdrew a 
proposal for a "review of financial aid based on 
race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity or national 
origin" at last week's three-day UC BaUd of 
Regents'meeting. . 

ConncrIy withdrew (he proposal before Friday's 
meeting. claiming that UC President Richard 
AtkinIOII told him earlier during the week that 
university officials were already working on such 
a review . 

"There was no other motive involved in its 
placement or removal from the apnda, "Connerly 

said. 
Connerly's proposal, named SP-31, originally 

called for the elimination of race-based financial 
aid. 

Connerly also sponsored last year's SP-I and 
SP-2 amendments, which eliminated race as a 
consideration in university admissions, hiring and 
contracting. 

"It seems to me that the era of our being 
allowed to use race as a consideration is rapidly 
drawing to a close," Connerly said, citing several 
recent court decisions to support his position. 

Regenf Roy Brophy voiced his opposition to

HOSPITAL: UCSD Medical

ByTeny Lew 
Associate News Editor 

SAN FRANCISCO- UC President Rich-
ard Atkinson announced his intent Friday to 
form a commission to get the five UC aca-
demic medicai centers back on track, after 
hearing the UCSD Medical Center is expect-
ing to post a $20.3 million loss for fiscal 1996. 

"The whole medicaVeducational enterprise 
needs to be examined in a way that cannot be 
done by this board or the president," Atkinson 
said at the monthly UC Board of Regents ' 
meeting. 

Senior UC officials told the regents' Com-
mittee on Health Services on Wednesday about 
the projected loss, and asked permission to 
begin partnership discussions with one or more 
unidentified health-care providers in the San 
Diego area. 

"I think every member of the board is 
concerned with the future of the medical cen-
ter," Regent Tirso del Junco said. "We realize 
we cannot continue with business as usual." 

UCSDViceChancellorofHealthSciences 
John Alksne presented an overview of the 
medical center's plight, as well as objectives 
for the center developed by the consulting 
firms Deloitte& Touche and the HunterGroup. 

According to the university's latest Activ-
ity and Financial Status Report of Hospitals 
and Clinics, the UCSD Medical Center lost 
$8.3 million during the first nine months of 
fiscal 1996, which ends June 30. 

Alksne attributed the loss to several fac-
tors, including $7.S million of "budget vari-
ances, unplanned contractual losses and man-
agement interventions which did not occur." 

However, A1ksne blamed much of the an-
ticipated loss on a drop in the A verqe Daily 
Census, the number of hospital beds filled 
each day. 

"The fiscal-year 1996 budget predicted 
increased census counII from March to June," 
he said. 

Although the avenae census IOIC sligNly 
in fiscal 1m, it dropped sharply between 
February and March 1996 and contirued to 
drop in April.

greater effectiveness and fewer side effects ~--------------------------------------------I~ CALLiNG ALL t-J\EN! CALLING ALL MEN ~ ; By Trlcl. Dey 
Guardian Reporter 

Allergy sufferers may soon be 
able to set aside their boxes of 
ti ssues, their eye drops and their 
allergy medications and venture 
into the wi Idemcss, due to a recent 
advance in the treatment of aller-
gies by UCSD sci-

"The gene-therapy approach in-
volves the person' s own [natural] 
response," Raz said. "It requires 
only two or three injections .... We 
don ' t foresee any side effects, but 
we won ' t know until we do the 
[human] studies." 

The proposed method uses 
DNA as a ignal 
to turn off a 
p e r so n 's 
oversensitivity to 
the allergen , 
thereby relieving 
irritating allergy 
symptoms. This 
new approach 
takes advantage of 
the immune 
system's dual and 
opposing re-
sponse to viruses 
and allergens. 
Simply put, the al -
lergic response 
competes with the 
viral-infection re-
sponse.

In a paper pub-

lished in the Pro-
ceedings a/11u! Na-

UCSD researchers 
reported that a

soon be available 
to treat allergies. 

Dr. Dennis

New Court Date to be Set for Affinllative-Action Protestors 

Heidi Muzhlk/Guamlan 
Outburst: An unidentified student protests outside the San Diego 
County Superior Counrthouse last week. 

DELAY: Accused say 
they are being held as 
examples to others 
By Esther Yoon 
Senior Staff Writer 

The San Diego County Superior 
Court last Thursday postponed until 
August the trial of 18 UC students 
who were arrested in March forblock-
ing an intersection adjacent to the 
UCSD campus during a protest. 

San Diego police arrested the stu-
dents for blocking the intersection of 
La 10lla Village Drive and Villa La 
101la Drive during a March 12 protest 
against the proposed Califomia Civil 
Rights Initiative (CCRl)- a measure 
which seeks to eliminate statewide 
affirmative-action policies in hiring 
and conlrdCting. 

The 18 students face several 
charges, including violating a mu-
nicipal code by blocking an intersec-
tion and failing to disperse upon pa-
lice orders. 

Former A.S. PresidentNaorni FaIk. 
one of the students arrested at the 
March 12 rally, claims that the trial 

We claim we are the best MeAT prep 
program, but why should you believe us? 

may be part of a political agenda 
centered around the upcoming San 
Diego Republican Convention. 

'The issue that we were protesting 
has become very political, and mem-
bers of the city and police are trying to 
make liii example of the students," 
Falk said. 

In Thursday's hearing, the county 
scheduled additional court appear-
ances for June 26, when the students 
will be assured legal consel, and July 
25, when a trial date will be set. 

Defense Attomey Jerry Blankrec-
om mended luly 25 as a trial-setting 
date in light of student graduations, 
the July 4 weekend and the "need for 
a reasonable amount of time to have 
proper representation forthe students." 

"We want to keep the cases to-
gether," Blank added. 

In po tponing the trial-seuing date, 
the defense argued that the students 
need an extended allotment of time to 
designate legal counsel because cur-
rently, "only three out of the 18 stu-
dents have legal representation." 

"Most of the 18 accused are here," 
B lank said. "I'hey are trying to put 
together an appointed counsel, but 

cannot afford attorney fees." 
Representatives from the court 

speculated that the case will not be 
decided until sometime in August. 

Over 20 members of UCSD's No 
Retreat! affirmative-action coalition 
protested in front of the San Diego 
County Courthouse Thursday morn-
ing in support of the 18 arrested stu-
dents and in opposition to CCRJ and 
the eli mi nat jon of affirmative action 
within the UC system. 

"Today, students demon trated 
their support for their fellow students 
and their opposition to the city 's dif-
ferential treatment of the protesters," 
said Falk, addressing the media 
present at the rally. 

'The civil disobedience of lhese 
students was a protest agai n t the UC 
regents' decision to eliminate affir-
mative action," No Retreat ! member 
and current A.S. Vice President Ex-
ternal Alex Tom said. "Making a 
commitment to diversity and then 
eliminating affirmative action dis-
played the hypocrisy of the UC re-
gents, particularly Ward Connerly." 

The prosecution was not available 
for comment.

Wilh More and More Peop,e 'Commuting 10 Campus., 
UCSD Is Facing a parking Meltdown 

TIll 1_1115111111. Is lllllIlIIe II. TIIIIii 
BJ BIIIIIII,II .. Palllllll Spices . 

By NMh8n PIetIIII 
Staff Writer 

If UCSD students can agree on 
anything, it's that parlOng here has 
become a real pain in the neck. 

Students who live on campus 
may not experience the extreme 
hassle that commuters endure every 
day when searching for a place to 
put, but it is not hard for them to 
imagine what it's like. It is not with 
fondness that I remember the days 
when I had to give up my cherished 
spot in the Muir parking lot to 
attend to midday business off 
campus. 

At any rate, many students were 
pleased when Transportation and 
Parking Services (f&PS) recently 
unveiled its new plan for improving 
UCSO's parlOng situation. 
Recognizing that parking spaces are 
nowata premium during peak 
hours and that UCSD will 
experience rapid growth over the 
next ' few years, T&PS 
proposed building a 

much-needed pair of parking 
structures in the central-campus 
area. 

Currently, there are 8,204 spaces 
around the central campus reserved 
for faculty, students and staff. 
During peak USl8e hours, 7,729 -
roughly 94 percent - of these 
spaces are filled. But are any of 
those 475 open spaces are even 
close to classrooms? Can you say 
"North PartcingT' Even when the 
spaces in East Parking are factored 
in, 93 percent of all spaces are filled 
during peak hours. ParlOng is bad 
even if you have the courage - and 
it takes courage in light of the recent 
crime spree - to park in East 
ParlOng and take the shuttle in. 

Moreover, during the next 10 
years. the number of students, staff 
and faculty 

piesent at the central campus during. 
business hours is expected to rise by 
more than 7,000 people, or about 25 
percent of tile current number. lbis 
prediction includes the expected 
demand caused by the construction 
of Sixth College on .the northern 
side of campus. To prevent parking 
demand from outstripping current 
supply, T &PS proposes creating 
3,000 new paridng spaces by the 
2005-06 academic y~. 

The downside t() developing 
new parking spaces is that prices for 
parking permits 'will increase 
signi ficantly. Over the next 10 
years, the price of mqnthly faculty 
"A" pennits is expected to increase 
by $144 per year, while monthly 
student pennits will increase by $99 
and giaduate permits by $135. Of

Contributing Opinion Writer 

It seems like a simple solution to a simple problem: Because 
it takes too long to find that elusive parking space, UCSO 
should build more parlOng spaces. And even better than just 
painting some more white lines on aspbalt, 
why not build huge structures chock full of 
this rare commodity? 

At a time when the administration is 
discussing the construction of parking 
structures, it is distressing to see that many 
students agree with this folly. Adding 
parlc.ing spaces would only address the 
symptoms - rather than the cause - of 
the campus .parking problem. And the 
cause of the problem is easy to identify: 
Too many people, .... ho could find other 
means of transpoltation, drive to campus. 

I understand that those who live in 
places like Imperial Beach or North Park 
really have no choice given our current 
public transit system, but there is no 
reason why anyone who lives close to

live just a few blocks from here, yet insist on driving their 
cars. I have no sympathy for the driver who whines that it 

Lakes him longer to drive to campus than to walk from his 
home two miles away. If he had taken the bus or ridden 

his bicycle, his commute would have been much 
quicker. 

People should simply think about what their needs 
are. For example, students should consider their 
commu'ting situation before they move into a new 
home. It costs no more to find an apartment close to 
a bus line, but many people don't think of this until 
it is too late. Paying attention to the commuting 
problem beforehand would have prevented it 

altogether. 
And think of how parki~ structures would affect 

traffic on campus. Gilman Drive is already heavily 
traveled; the addition of a parking structure just off 
Gilman, as proposed, would tum it into a freeway. If 
any structures are built, they should be located on 
the outskirts of the campus so that we can m~ntain 
a pedestrian-friendly environment. Do we really 

want more cars zooming right through the middle of 
campus? 

The Transportation Policy Committee's plans for 
more shuttle services to off-campus locations is a. step 

in the right direction, but we need to go further. First, 
the administration should get rid of the North and East 

Parking shuttles. If people make the sel fish decision to 
drive, they should be forced to hoof it in from where they 

park. This would add time to people 's commutes and 
discourage them from driving. 

Next, kill the campus-loop shuttles. [ have been here for 
nearly two years, and I've never found a need for these buses. 
Considering their disorganized schedule, these shuttles are 
hardly convenient; they are merely a luxury for the lazy. These

·A.S. WILL NOT REVOKE REVIEW'S FUNDING 
Editor: 

I would like to clarify a couple 
misrepresented points in the May 16, 
1996 Guardian article ''Controversial 
California Review Advertisement 
Provokes A.S. Debate." 

First, there was never ' any 
"debate." When the ad was brought to 
the council's attention, the discussion 
that occurred was pure reaction to 
what almost all council members 
identified as an image of the Ku Klux 
Klan. lbis image, like all images, is 
open to interpretation. But when 
members of the California Review 
came in to explain the image, they did 
not provide any other interpretations. 

Second, the article distorted the 
topic of the California Review's 
funding. implying that. because of the 
present issue, its funding was in 
jeopardy. This is absolutely not the 
case. This council does not intend to 
revoke funding from any publication 
on the basis of content This is a 
policy that will be completely abided 
by during the ongoing processing of 
next year's executive budget 

However, councilmembers had 
every right to represent their

constitucIU at Wednesday's meeting 
by expressing oulrlF and sUIess at 
the California Review's decision to 
use such baleful, oppteSSive images. 
In fact, these sentiments were 
expressed by most A.S. members, 
including registered Republicans, 
whose views are meant to be 
represcnted by the Colifomia Review. 

As a member of a friendly, 
student.oomted council that stands 
very much for human rights and 
respect for all, I invite all UCSD 
students to take an interest in this 
issue (and any others, of course) by 
coming to the ASUCSO meeting this 
Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in the Price 
Center Cove. We have invited the 
staff of the California Review to 
attend, so that together we can better 
address the situation.

Debates Labs' Futwe," May 9, 1996). 
Your article states that I SJX*e out 
against the renewal of the UC-
laboratories contract However, I did 
not even mention the issue in my 
presentation about Los Alamos 
Nationall...aboratoly in New Mexico. 
As a graduate student and the only 
non-voting member at the 
proceedings. I felt my job was to 
provide information about Los 
Alamos that might be i~t for 
faculty in their decision about 
whether to renew the contract. 
Nobody on the panel, in the 
Academic Senate or, I might add, 
your repol1er, ever asked for my 
position on the matter. 

I am less concerned with who 
manages the laboratories than with 
the quality of that management. The 
University Committee on Research 
Policy's report concluded that the 
University of California has never 
taken an active role in managing the 
laboratories, leaving these institutions 
largely autonomous. My presentation 
was drawn from over two years of 
research on public relations at Los 
Alamos. 

I do not believe that a commercial 
contractor would have any incentive 
to address local concerns. The 
university, however, could be 
instrumental in ensuring academic 
freedom, employee rights and public 
involvement, as well as 
environmental cleanup and the re-
articulation of the mission of the 
national laboratories away from 
nuclear weapons. 

The post-Cold War period has 
been a time of great uncenainty at the 
national laboratories, and a strong 
manager could be instrumental in 
influencing the future of these 
institutions - but the management 
has to be willing to do so. The 
immediate question involves ' 
whether the university is willing to 
rethink its relationship with the 
laboratories and take a more activist 
role. 

The point of my presentation was 
to illustrate that the status quo has not 
worked in New Mexico and to press 
for a discussion about how to 
improve this situation in the future.

pay for them. So while we may nOl.

there is nothing wrong with charging 
more for the privilege to park. 

But there is a temptation to tum 
the parking issue into something it is 
not. Some would argue that T&PS's 
proposals are, al best, a band-aid 
solution to the parking problem. 
According to these critics. the real 
issue is that too many people are 
driving to campus. 'They argue that 
instead of dealing with the shortage 
of parking spaces as a campus

an environmental issue. Too many

that can be put to better use. 

Shuttle bu~es l>hould be 
provided to many different areas of 
San Diego. Many students have 
chosen to live in Hillcrest because 
there is shUllle service there, 
proving that student living patterns 
can be altered by providing 
transponation. The university 
might want to look for areas where 
many, car commuters now live, 
with the idea of adding shull ies to 
that area. For example, many 
students live east of University 
Towne Centre in the Renaissance 
development. Yet. there is

should not be, and few students use 
public transportation or carpool. 
Proponents of this argument insist 
that we cannot let the situation spiral 
out of control; we cannot get into the 
vicious circle of letting campus 
growth necessitate the construction 
of new parting spaces. At some 
point, we're going to have to change 
our ways of getting to campus. 

This argument ignores important 
facts about what it means to live in 
Southern California. Since our 
community is so large and 
sprawling. it is simply not cost 
effective to build public 
transportation systems on a grand 
scale. There are no central locations 
in the city where public 
transportation networks - buses or 
light railroad - can converge. 
Whi Ie UCSD and downtown San 
Diego arc two central areas of 

and from that area. 
We should also triple existing 

parking-permit fees. There will 
always be some people who insist 
on driving. and these people will 
pay the new higher fces . Yet this 
would also reduce the pressure for 
parking spaces. Maybe demand 
would fall so far that we could 
convert some asphalt back into 
eucalyptus groves. 

Some argue that parking-permit 
fees should be inversely tied to the 
distance the student or staff 
member lives from campus. But 
anyone at UCLA - where 
everyone claims to live with his 
grandmother in Bakersfield -
would tell you this plan would not 
work. It also encourages long 
commuting distances, when we

activity, the real problem is gelling 
people from where they live to 
where they work. People live and 
work in so many different places that 
there is no way to build a public 
transportation system that can meet 
everyone's needs in a convenient. 
efficient manner. It is therefore 
necessary that many people use their 
cars 10 commute. 

Moreover, for all their 
complaining about the costs of car 
insurance. car repair, commuting 
time and the hassles of finding a 
parking spot, people enjoy the usc of 
their automobiles. It allows them to 
commute to work from aneas where 
they feel most comfortable living. 
Many people value the peace and 
security of their suburban homes and 
would never dream of living near 
where they work. Furthermore, 
commuting lets people save money

possible to our destinations. 

A public education campaign 
pointing out the true costs of 
driving would al 0 help. Many 
people think only of the gasoline 
they buy, but when other factors -
like that $1,000 transmission job 
- are taken into account. driving 
costs approximately 30 cents per 
mile. A rerson who lives 10 miles 
from campus spends S6 per day 
just to drive - or $150 per month. 
Even an unsubsidized $49 bus pa s 
looks like a good deal compared to 
driving. 

Some of these measures may 
sound drastic, but as an institution 
of research and learning. it is our 
responsibility to set a good 
example for others to follow. At the

UCS D students and their guests who

A fter students reached the front

SHORTFALL: 
Administrators plan 
to cut back on staff 
ContInued from pee. 1 _ 

The census has sunk consistently 
since March 1992, when it peaked at 
330. If the current average of 279 
patients is maintained Uuoogh the end 
of the fiscal year. hospital administra-
tors predict the lost patient revenue 
will total $8.5 million. At press time. 
275 of the hospital·s 415 available 
beds were occupied. 

Several regents questioned why 
they were not informed earlier of the 
projected loss. 

''Whal bothers me most about this 
entire thing is that we' ve had all these 
discussions. and suddenly. we're $21 
million short." Regent Roy Brophy 
said. '1'hese things didn', occur over-
nigh .. " 

However. UC Vice President of 
Clinical Services Development Will-
iam Gurtner said the UC Office of the 
President acted as quickly as it could 
to make the regents aware of the short-
fall. 

"Could we have brought these 
numbers to you last month. we wou Id 
have." Gurtner said.

ADMISSIONS: 
Regents debate what 
is undue influence 
Continued from p.,. 1 
dent of Academic Affairs C. 
Judson King and Director of Un-
dergraduate Admissions Carla 
Ferri presented the university 's 
latest set of admissions guidelines 
to the regents. 

"The guidelines are drafted in a 
very broad way," Ferri said. "11 
will be up to the campuses to take 
(them) and implement some speci-
ficity ." 

However, Atkinson acknowl-
edged that the guidelines' indefi-
nite nature could lead to inconsis-
tencies. 

"We've chosen to give each 
campus a certain amount of lee-
way," Atkinson said. "It's con-
ceivable a student could be re-
jected at one campus by its admis-
sions process and admitted at an-
other." 

Item 12 of the revised guide-
lines requires admissions officers 
to take "academic accomplish-

ments in light of the candidate's 
. life experiences and special cir-
cumstances" into account. 

"We point out refugee status 
and veterans' status, and I think 
we should point out victims of 
racism or ageism," Regeot Tom 
Sayles said. "( just don ' t think we 
can close our eyes to individual 
people's experiences." 

"Am I going to write in my 
essay that I came from a dysfunc-
tional family? I think we need to 
look at how we' re going to capture 
that information if we ' re going to 
[consider it)," Regent A lice 
Gonzales added. 

According to Atkinson, it is 
hard todraw the line between what 
is legitimate admissions criteria 
and what is not. 

"This is a very difficult issue," 
Atkinson said. "However we do it, 
it will not be satisfactory. We are 
moving into a world much more 
complicated than the world we 
lived in ." 

King also presented the results 
of a review on special treatment in 
admissions procedures, conducted 
at Atkinson's request. The review

UC Regent Designate 

consisted of reports which surfaced 
earlier in the year about the chil -
dren and acquaintances of promi-
nent individuals who received 
preferential treatment from the 
UCLA and UC Berkeley admis-
sions offices. 

"At the undergraduate level, 

chancellors have the authority to 
admit students by exception to the 
eligibility requirements, if they 
show intellectual promise," King 
said . "It appears [that] in a very 
small number of instances, reoom-
mendations from prominent indi-
viduals may have had influence in 
the appeals." 

According to King, the univer-
sity received apprmdmately 215 
inquiries from prominent individu-
als - defined as regents, legisla-
tors, high government or eorpo-
rate figures and major donors -
each year duri ng the past fi ve years. 
The university receives more than 
30,000 general inquiries into un-
dergraduate admissions each year. 

"No more than 12 applications 
per year have or may have re-
cei ved some positive consideration 
as a result of inquiries or letters of 
recommendation from individu-
als," King said. "Only 0.03 per-
cent of the 40,000 admissions typi-
cally granted each fall ha ve or may 
have been influenced by a promi-
nent individual's inquiry."

mon form of inquiry. 
"At the undergraduate level, let-

ters of recommendation are not 
usually considered in the decision 
process unless they contain new 
information about special talents, 
hardships or academic awards," 
King said. 

Several regents said they would 
not let the possibility of undue 
influence keep them from writing 
letters. 

"I write leiters of recommenda-
tion, and I will continue to write 
leiters of recommendation until 
they put it in the penal code," Re-
gent Roy Brophy said. "I think 
each of us here needs to make a 
valuejudgment why we're writing 
letters. " 

California Lt. Governor Gray 
Davis, an ex-officio regent, said 
he supported letters of recommen-
dation as long as the process was 
not a secret. 

"Some regents said they would 
never write letters again or make 
phone calls," Davis said. "I don't 
share that view. I'm certainly nOl 
for abolishing leiters of recom-
mendation, but I would be in favor 
of the university making the infor-
mation available to the public." 

Atkinson said he was tom be-
tween the desire to make sure ev-
ery qualified student got into the 
university, and the reality that ex-
ceptional students don't always fit 
the university's model. 

"My personal belief is that 100 
percent of admissions should be of 
the category relating to individual 
qualifications and the like," 
Atkinson said. "On the other hand, 
I believe there has to be some de-
gree of leeway." 

However, Regent Designate Ri-
chard Russell questioned how 
much leeway is permissible. 

"The question is: Is it appropri-
ate for me to go to Chancellor Tien 
[ofUC Berkeley] and hand him an 
application packet? Is i( appropri-
ate for me to appeal on behalf of 
my children, or those of business 
associates, in admissions deci-
sions?" 

After some debate, the regents 
ultimately passed a resolution 
drafted by Connerly, which noted 
that "any correspondence or in-
quiries received from individual 
regents and from elected officials 
may be appropriate, but also notes 
that efforts to inappropriately in-
fluence the outcome of individual 
admissions decisions are not. " 

However, UCLA Chancellor 
Charles Young said it is impos-
sible to divorce simple letters of 
recommendation from attempts to 
influence admissions decisions. 

"Anyone that writes a letter is 
attempting to influence a deci -
sion," Young said. "That' s why 
they're writing the letter. Influ-
ence is no,! bad as long as it ' s not 
undue influence."

THEFTS: 
Editors claim ad was 
not meant to offend 
Continued from pee. 8 
offended by an advertisement which 
ran in the latest issue of the Califor-
nia Review. The advertisement de-
picted two hooded individuals stand-
ing over a man in shackles and the 
words: "We can help you .... Sub-
scribe to the California Review." 

California Review Editor in Chief 
Kerry Liu said that the image al-
luded to the Spanish Inquisition and 
was not meant to offend anyone. 

"[The image] was already pub-
lished three years ago, and A.S. had 
no problem with iI," Liu said. "It 
wasn't unlilthe article about them 
[in the current issue] that they fin -
gered it." 

California Revieweditors would 
not speculate on who committed the 
thefts. 

Meanwhile, A.S. President 
Coleen Sabatini explained that the 
A.S. is simply trying to establish 
dialogue bet ween the editors of the 
California Review and the council. 

"The only action being taken is 
that we did talk to the California 
Review and invited them to talk to us 
and give us their interpretation of 
the ad," Sabatini said. "It was found 
to be very offensive and oppressive 
in nature because of the hooded fig-
ures ' resemblance to the [Ku Klux 
Klan)." 

In a letter to the Guardian last 
week, Commissioner of Communi-
cations lames Fabionarstressed that 
the California Review's funding is 
not in jeopardy because of the 
present controversy. 

"It is not the intention of thi s 
council to take away funding from 
any publication on the basis of con-
tent," Fabionar stated. "This is a 
policy that will becompletely abided 
by, as we are presently in the midst 
of the executive-budget process for 
next year." 

The California Review, which is 
published on a bi-quarterly basis, 
has an annual operating budget of 
$2,340.

14 SPORTS 

WOMEN: 'Five Tri~ons 
from title team graduate 
ContInued from pa,e 20 
Hoecker and Hilary Somers have been atop the 
Triton ladder ineachoftheirthree seasons on the 
squad. The addition of Susan Huberman last 
year completed the starting six. 

"We were strong from number one to six," 
SomeTS said. "Any person could have been 
successful at any number." 

Solid grOdnd strokes, aggres ive net play 
and excellent doubles teamwork characterized 
the IeaJII' S perfonnances. In the majority of 
matches this season,the Tritons' doubles teams 
gained the early ad vantage and then victory was 
cemented with assertive individual efforts. 

Tilton team members and coaches alike 
emphasized their genuine love for the sport of 

The UCSD Guardian 

tennis. This love has grown throughout the 
years, especially during this season. 

"Even though we lost [at Nationals], we 
learned more about teamwork and came to-
gether to play," Kurokawa said. "We matured 
over the years; we learned to enjoy the game." 

Needless to say, the UCSD women's tennis 
program faces an immense challenge in filling 
the five positions that have been vacated. AJ-
though freshmen KaaJa Potashnick and Jennifer 
Drimmer played well during their fewopportu-
nities this season, the team will be looking for 
new talent and working hard to fulfill its past 
tradition of excellence. 

"Our team was like a family," Somers said. 
" It was fun to go out everyday and spend a few 
hours together. We became the best offriends." 

'The seniors should definitely feel good 
about all that they've accomplished in their 
careers," LaPlante said. 

MEN: UCSD finished 
the season ranked third 
Continued from p ... 20 
especially because of the depth of our singles 
players," UCSD's Mike Wilson said. 

As singles players, Wilson and fellow 
senior Eric Steidlmayer- friends and former 
roommates - took care of business wherever 
they played. Earlier in the season, Wilson 
defeated the challenge of his long-time 
Redlands foe in the number-two spot, and 
consequently moved up to the top position 
near the end of the year. 

As the number-one Triton singles player, 
Wilson maintained his intensity and ability to 
take home the win, despite being hampered by 
a hyperextended elbow. 

Sleidlmayer saw action over the course of 

. Monday; May 20, 1996 

the year in all three of the highest seals. His 
notable achievements in each position. espe-
cially his dominance in the third seat, earned 
him a post-season trip to the nationals as an 
individual player. 

Not only were the two players critical to the 
teain's success in singles, but as a duo for the 
past three seasons they have proven lethal. 

[n a sport where gaining the doubles point 
is essential, Wilson and Steidl mayer com-
bined their rich talents to manhandle even the 
toughest of competitors, evidenced in their 
tough win over Redlands' lop tandem in the 
regionals. 

"With Steidlrnayer and Wilson as seniors, 
the team is losing not only some of our top-
ranked singles players but also ourtop doubles 
team," Tumer said. "But [think the team can 
definitely pick up where we left off this year 
and have another good season."

MARGE: Maybe 
she should shut-up 
Continued from page 20 
Compared to her. Ebenezer Scrooge 
is a sailor on shore leave. Not surpris-
ingly, her poor employees are the 
most underpaid administrative assis-
tants in a major professional sport. 

Reilly also presents a Schott retro-
spective (all on the record) wi th her 
unbelievably thoughtless racial slurs. 
For instance, she was orice kidding 
with outfielder Dave Parker in the 
mid-80s, calling him her "million 
dollar nigger." SchOlt has made doz-
en of statements like that over the 
years, and has had the monumental 
gall to defend each of them. 

On the subject of life tyles, he 
gives a thumbs down to gays, fornica-
tors and couples living in sin (see ex-
manager Davey Johnson). She's not 
crazy about Asians or Jews, either. 

Her rnoSl famous and surreal gaffe 
of all, though, was her pep rally forthe 
misunderstood 'Dolf Hitler (Pro: 
roads; Con: genocide). But hey, she 
meant it. This third-generation Ger-
man-American had family who fought 
against the American forces in World 
War n, and as a child she played with 
little toy Nazis and swa.~tikas. If you 
grew up with that mindset, you'd think 
nothing of popping orr about people 
of color. Hell, they're not like us any-
way. 

For those of us who are able to 
keep sports in perspective, however, 
Marge offers great comic relief. We're 
appalled, but also amused. After all, 
her narrow ,lonely world has no bear-
ing on our mortgage payments or our 
Saturday night dates. Is she danger-
ous? There's no law against stupidity 
or being cheap. 

[s Marge Schott bad for baseball? 
Of course. She's an insult, a disgrace 
and a mockery of a sham. Unfortu-
nately, apart of her idiocy isjust pure, 
uncut racism. 

Not just that little underlying vein 
you see in old-guard conservatives, or 
the time when Nana lets one slip after 
gelling cutoff in traffic by a black kid. 
It's the deep-~ kind thal may 
dictate business decisions and leads to 
hurtful remarks that offend baseball 
fans and decent folks everywhere. 

If baseball had a real commis-
sioner, like Bart Giamatti, then the 
Schott Reich would probably be gut-
ted just to set a great example and -
Nab, she'd just get another one-year 
suspension and a fine. 

Only players, like Pete Rose, are 
banned for life. 'The only way to de-
pose Marge forever is a good, old-
fashioned coup d 'etat by her dis-
gruntled, underpaid generals. In fact. 
dido 't Hitler's generals try to dO away 
with him because he went too far? 

And in the end, the Schott fiasco 
only proves, more than ever, thal base-
ball mirrors American life. We take 
the good and - in the case of Schott 
and others - the honendously bad.

·Sun God SpoI1sFeast 
1M AWARDS: UCSD students competed at the annual 
Intramural Sun G~ Sports Festival at Muir Courts 
By Den Kr.ft 
Sports Editor 

As the pany animals slept off Friday's Sun 
God concerts, hundreds of sports fanatics made 
their way to Muir Saturday morning for heated 

competition in sports, ranging from 
football and soccer (on the Muir 
fields) to floor hockey ( in the Rec 
gym) and basketball (on the Muir 
courts). 

Some of the most zealous com-
petitors were forced to begin com-
petition as early as 8 a.m., when the 
opening rounds of the basketball 

and football events kicked off. 
The four-on-four format for men's flag foot-

ball made for an impressive aerial display over 
the two 40-yard fields. Although there were only 
five teams in attendance, the competition was 
fierce - and according to the captain of eventual 
champion Cochese's Leftovers: Rob Richards, 
the teams were more talented than in years past. 

The championship game was a rematch be-
tween Richards' squad and a team with the unin-
spired litle of No Name. The No Namers and the 

Leftovers knew each other well, 
as the two teams had mutual 
members of many other intra-
mural sports teams. The IwO 
teams had also done battle dur-
ing pool play -the result being 
a lopsided victory, 31-6, in fa-
vor of the nameless ones. 

However, the championship 
game was a different SIOry. De-
spite scoring first, No Name was 
eventually beaten soundly, 31-
12. And as for friendly compe-
tition among the familiar com-
batants? 

"I don't know how friendly 
it was, I think it was pretty in-
tense," Richards said. 

... v ..... ,. "'''y 2v. IYYO 

The highlight of the day on 
the gridiron was actually more 
of a "low light." It came in the 
title game when Cochese's 
quanerback took a shot al play-
ing receiver and, after reeling 
in a 20-yard pass, turned and 
headed upfield . No Name 
wouldn't quit on the play, how-
ever, hustling from behind 10 
make a diving attempt at the 
flag. This attempt took not only 
the yellow plastic, bUI also a 
huge chunk of shorts, under-
wear "and I think a little crack 
100," Richards said. 

Uke Mike: Former Triton basketball player Kahlll Allen 
takes to the air in an Open Division match at Muir Courts. 

With the football competition bringing in 
such a memorable highlight, attention then turned 
to the basketball courts, where the largest num-
bcrofthe day's competitors were out to compete. 
The format for hoops was five-on-five, full court, 
runnin', gunnin' and, yes, dunkin' , as Ihe rims 
were lowered to just over nine feet. Two levels of 
competition divided the teams into intermediate 
and open divisions. 

The Intermediate Division was underway first. 

Fuzzy Pickles, which was led by Triton basket-
ball slandout Malt Aune. Aune's massive frame 
had little trouble dominaling around the lowered 
rims. The Pickles were able to gel by Insertion 
From 20' , which featured Mall Minchan and 
Kahlil Allen, when Mark Sebek nailed a two-
pointer to close outlhe competition. 

Another winner was, Tim Mclntyre,a Warren 
freshman who came OUI to compete in the most 
spiri ted event of them all without even a hint of 
nerves, who threw home a series of dunks, in-
cluding a soaring 360-degree slam.

After pool play, two favorites emerged: Buttafuco 
and Dr. J-3. The seedings held true to form, as the 
two learn met in the finals, with Dr. J-3 claiming 
the victory on asweel ally-oop from Rob Allen 10

MICASA 
MIKE MARTINEZ 

Parting Schott 
Baseball is the perfect 

metaphor for America - iI's 
almost as though the two are 
in a parallel universe. We . 
love a country with too much 
crime, mediocre educational 
policy and a gargantuan 
national debt. We love a 
nation that cuts funding to the 
arts and may soon follow suit 
on affirmative action. 

We love a country full of 
contradictions. One moment 
you see police officers 
stomping on Rodney King, or 
a street mob stoning a 
helpless trucker until he's on 
the brink of death. Then, you 
tum ~ound and a group of 
total strangers spends three 
days trying to get some kid 
out of a well. 

Indeed, in America, we 
take the good with the bad. 
Baseball is a good - or 
should I say, accurate -
example. In its glory years, 
baseball gave us the grace of 
DiMaggio, the athleticism of 
Mays, the opportunism of 
Reggie and the virtue of 
Ripken. 

But i~ recent years, it has 
also provided us with the 
disrepute of McLain, the 
arrogance of Steinbrenner and 
the hostility of Belle. 

And, of course, now the 
stupidity of Marge Schott, 
owner of the Cincinnati Reds. 

If she was a ballplayer, it 
could be said that she has 
really been "in a zone" so far 
this season. But Marge's zone 
is not a rarefied atmosphere 

• of uncanny athletic skills or 
good fortune. Hers is based 
on brain lock, which makes 
each n~w public statement 
that she produces more 
ridiculous than her previous 
one. 

For. example, her season 
started when a respected 
umpire, John McSherry, 
dropped dead on the field at 
Riverfront Stadium 6n 
Opening Day. Marge's 
"sympathetic" reaction? To 
parapbrase: "Great! This is all 
I need." 

If indeed there has been a 
.... decline of American intelli-

gence over the last genera-
tion, then the sports world 
provides the champion. On a 
stupidity scale, Marge Schott 
can be likened to Bo Derek: a 
perfect "JO." Stupid is an 
adjective more suited to the 
playground - the last riposte 
of the unimaginative. If 
you're into "truh talk." the 
word is too generic to truly 
zin •. 

Schott is a multi-million-
aire, a shrewd bulinen-
woman, owner of a World 
Series rin, ... but, "stupid i. u 
stupid does." Stupid fits.
