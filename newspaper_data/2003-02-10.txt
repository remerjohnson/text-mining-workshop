Columbia disaster may 
affect UCSD program 
Future uncertain for ISS 

EarthKAM program 
By CARLAN WENDLER 

Senior Staff Writer 

For ISS EanhKAM, the aftcr-
mJth of the Fcb. I space hurtle 
Columbia disaster could mean the 
end for the U SD-based, NASA-
arfihatcd program that operatcs 
unnoticed by most students. 

I . EanhKAJVI began in 1995 
as the project of Sally Ride, the first 
American woman III space and a 
phYSICS professor ar UC D. Her 
viSIOn was to collaborate witb 

ASA to mount a high-resolution 
digital camera on shuttles and 
allow middle school sllIdents to 

reque~t pictures of specific loca-
tions on Earth. 

Orficlals at NA liked the idea 
and mounted the fir~t camera on 
thc spa(.e hllllle Endeavour m 
1996. The Interim time was spent 
acquiring the necessary materials 
to build a mis ion operations cen-
ter III the Sdcncc and Engineering 
Research FJciliry building at 

CSD. Intel, Sun and IBM made 
contrihutions along with a host of 
other companies. 

Three years and four shuttle 
nllssions later, program directors 
sought a more stable placcmcnt for 

cartan WendieJ/Guordion 
In peril: ISS EarthKAM. which was 
founded at UCSD by phYSICS professor 
and former Astronaut 5al~ Ride. operates 
a camera aboard the space station 

the camcra in the new 
International Space Station. Ride 
again approached ASA officials, 
who moved the ca mera aboard the 
Inrernaoonal Space Station, where 
it currently remains.

BRIEFLY 
Semen quality declines 
over time, study says 

Age plays a greater role In semen fer-
tility than previously thought, since semen 
quality declines with each passing year 
according to a study conducted by 
researchers at UC Ber eley and Lawrence 
livermore National Laboratory, 

Researchers examined 97 men 
between the ages of 22 and 80. 

They discovered that while age had an 
effed on semen volume, the more signif-
Icant Impad was on sperm motility, which 
was found to decrease by 0.7 percent per 
year. thiS means that at age 22, the 
chance of sperm motility being clinically 
abnormal IS 25 percent, reaches 40 per-
cent by age 30, 60 percent by age 40, 
and nses to 85 percent by age 60. 

Researchers also noted that progres-
sive motility also started to decrease in 
men aged In their twentles·by 31 percent 
per year. 

The study demonstrates why paternal 
age matters. The findings were published In 
the Feb. 6 Issue of Human ReproductIOn. 

Internet now first source 
of media for most 

Because more than 70 percent of 
Amencans who use he Internet now con-
Sider online technolo~ to be heir most 
Important source or Information, the 
Internet now ranks higher than all other 
media as an Information source, according 
to findings In Year Three of the UCLA 
Internet Report 

When Internet users were asked to 
ran the importance of malor media, 61.1 
percent said the Internet was very impor-
tant or extremely Importan~ surpassing 
books (60.3 percent), newspapers (57.8 
percent), televiSion (50.2 percent), radio 
(40 percent) and magazines (28.7 per· 
cent). Even among Intemet users with 
less than one year onhne, 52 percent said 
that the Internet is very important or 
extremely Important. 

The top online activity In 2002 was e· 
mall. Other activities, in decreaSing order 
of populanty are Instant messaging. Web 
surting or browsmg, reading news, shop· 
pmg and bUYing onhne, and accessing 
entertainment information. 

By comparison, teleVision remains the 
most Important source of entertainment, 
With the Internet ranked fourth .

Majority of children born 
In Calif. now Latino 

The majority of children being born in 
California are Latino, according to a study 
conducted by the UCLA Center for the 
Study of Latino Health and Culture. 

In the summer of 200 1, more than half 
of the babies born were Latino. SpeCifically, 
45.5 percent of the births In San Diego 
County that year were Latino. Though more 
than two-thirds of Latino babies were born 
in Southern California, researchers also 
noted that Latino births now occur In nearly 
all counties, signalling a shift In the state's 
future demographIC trends. 

The trend in the Increase of Latino births 
can be traced to 1975, when 26.5 percent 
of the births In California were LatinO. In 
1980, that number had risen to 29 percen~ 
and then 31.1 percent In 1985. In 1990, 
the number of Latino births had Increased 
to 38.6 percent, followed by another 
increase to 45.8 percent In 1995.

Lecture to discuss women

A UC Regents lecture titled "The

Wasserman in the Copely InternatIOnal 
Conference· Center at the Institute of the 
Americas on Feb. 11 at 6 p.m. 

Wasserman Will diSCUSS the fact that 
though the number of women earning 
degrees In science and englneenng has 
Increased dramatlcally over the past 25 years, 
women remain scarce in the senior ranks of 
dlsoplines In both Industry and academia. 

Wasserman will discuss possible causes 
for thiS Imbalance and will suggest steps that 
Institutions and indrvidual 'MlITlen can take to 
remove the barriers that continue to hinder 
the advancement of female scientists and 
engineers.

Ice cream would make a sweet addition to Price Center 
By EVELYN HSIEH 

Staff Wnter 

Few thIngs rJI·al the pleasure 
of IndulgIng in a smooth, 
cream)" rich and sweet scoop of 
ice cream. Slowly allowing a 
lick of fudge marble to pene-
trate the senses after a tough 
midterm IS a temporary escape 
IIlto a trouble-free world . I ow 
the .S . Councd has recog-
nized the potenrial for a ven-
ture that \\ ill provide dady taste 
bud satisfaction, havlllg 
announced that an ice cream 
parlor is being consIdered a an 
addition to the Price Cenrer as 
p,m of the game room renova-
tion. 

Wtth the current dining 
option .vadable a t the Price 
Center, an Ice crea m parlor 
would be a refreshing addmon 
that would also accommodate 
different ta tes. Unlike most of 
the rest of the eateries in the 
Pnce Center, an Ice cream parlor 
would be a good place to grab 
something in betwecn c1assc) 
and would cater to impulse 
appetl tes (whIch would be a 
good wa}' to make a quicker 

buck). And with the current surf-
ing and tanning weather in the 
middle of wlIlter, an ice cream 
place would be ideal for heat-
exha usted and smoothie-weary 
students. 

Such a parlor would also 
provide a more diverse and 
socially active atlTIO phere III 
the Price Center. Students 
could socialize with friends over 
ice cream, but filllsh fast 
enough as to not exacerbate 
crowdIng problems at Price 
Center Plaza . 

In terms of choosing a brand 
to occupy the allocated space, 
the A.S. Council should pick 
something well-known . The 
leading contender is Freshens, 
which operates a station in John 
1uir College's Sierra Summit. 

This choice is understandable, 
but flawed . PiciG!1g Freshens 
could be a good choice because 
of its proven reliability at ierrll 
Summit. Because Fre hens .:loes 
not charge brand-related fees, 
the A. . CounCIl would have a 
safer assurance that Its invest-
ment would be returned III a 
nmely fashIOn . 

However, the current 

Freshens establishment on cam-
pu in a dining hall may turn off 
some potential customer 
because they could JUSt as easily 
mosey on over to Muir and get it 
there. 

Well-known restaurants 
already occupy the Price Center, 
and the recent choice of Panda 
Express shows that studcnrs 
a OClate quality with name. For 
thIS reason, it would be wise for 
the council to ;elect a food out-
let with name recognition, as 
opposed to Freshens or the Food 
Co-op. 100 Time and Cold 

tone creameries eem to bc 
good choices because of their 
innovative new techniques and a 
wide selection of flavors. 
IIowever, with both store 
already across La Jolla Village 
Dnve, students - and particu-
larly off-campus ones -may not 
be as enthusiastic for something 
they can already ea ily acces 
near C D . The pre tlge of a 
name such as Haagen-Dazs or 
Ben and Jerry's would speak 
both to the qualiry and conve-
nIence of a Price Center loca-
tion . 

While a food co-op would 

please many sntdents, the fact 
thaI the Sunshine Store exis ts in 
the Price Center somewhat dis-
counts its value. Students can 
already get ready-made items 
and other stop-and -shop foods 
there. And whil e at first glance, 
an ice cream shop may seem 
impractical and unneeded, its 
novelry sta tus is precisely why 
it should be implimented over 
the food co-op. Students who 
want more sub tantial food have 
choices at the food court 
already, but have few option if 
all they want is a quick pick-me-
up. And a food co-op will do 
less to add to the atmosphere of 
the Price Center, while an ice 
cream parlor is a fun choice for 
students. 

When it comes down to it, 
the winners in this delicious 
choice would be students. 
Sirting on Library Walk in the 
warm January sunshine, watch-
IIlg the students pass by and 
hearing the calm trickling of the 
Price Cenrer fountain is already 
a blissful experience. Add a 
spoonful' of mocha almond chIp 
and it all borders on transcen-
dent.

DUKE IT OUT

Students would be better served by another food co-op 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 

OpInion Editor 

Today, the University 
Centers AdVISOry Board meets 
to answer a que;uon more rele-
vant to the average UCSD SLU-
dent than "Should we attack 
Iraq'" "Is aiJortion murder"· 
and "How am I gomg to pay my 
tUItIon thIS quarter~" 10re 
Importalllly, ICC cream parlor or 
food o-op a tell ltC' 

Perhaps thi; is a t)'l1lcal exag-
gcrauon . But slllce food IS hfe 
and we are what we eat, thIS 
decISIon WIll have a bIg lin pact 
on our dally itves. On the one 
hand IS Ice crcam - yummy, 
cold and operated by A.S. 
Entcrpmes - and on the other 
I; the UCSJ) Food o -op, 
whIch operatcs WIth great suc-
ces~ III the Student enter and 
could open a salelllte In the 
soon-to-bc renovated Pnce 
Center Lameroom. The lalter IS 
the better option 

The first reason for Imnglllg 
the Food Co-op to the Price 
Center - Imown to many on 

campus as the Iligh -Pnce 
Center - IS a SImple matter of 
dollars and cents . Currently, 
your average Price Center 
lunch costs $6 or $7, whether 
it's a combo plate at Panda 
Express, an "extra value" meal 
at Wendy'S, a Subway sandwich 
or a RubIO'S burrtto combo. 
The co -op, however, offers 

optlon~ much casler on a cash -
strapped student's wallet. A 
delIcious !>oup-fillcd bread bowl 
IS only $2 .50; add luice and a 
small salad to complete the 
meal and you're sllll well under 
$5. Even one lonely dollar can 
go much further at the co-op-
bUylllg a toasty bagel and a slab 
of cheese, or example - than 
at any other food outlet on 
campus, wilich IS sure to please 
the students who fi nd them-
selves rummagIng through 
backpack!. and payphone coin-
returns to scrape together 
enough change to fill theIr 
stomachs . 

Secondly, the food the co-op 
offers IS 2 healthy aiternlltlve to 
the grease -laden fa t food 

choices currently filling the 
food court. Vegetarians, of 
which there are many at 
UCSD, have few option for 
lunch in Price Center other 
than wilted Iceberg lettuce and 
soggy quesadillas. The Food 
Co-op's choices include meat-
less treats like ' Iofurkey sand-
wlche , humlllus Jnd vegetarian 
cllI It , all of whIch are tdSty to 
omntvorcs, as well. ot to 
mention that the alterna te 
option - icc creant - I 
unhealthy in extreme. 

Perha ps the greatest rea on 
to advocate the Food Co-ops 
expansion to the Price Center is 
to su PpOrt the co-op structu re. 
Whde the politIC a soc lated

VIdes for benefit3 hke employ-

AstOundingly the student celller

LEIIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Students must fight 

cuts to services 
Editor: 

Rc : "Student services to suffer 
from budget CutS" (Feb. 3). It sad-
dens me to hear the details of the 
proposed budget cuts. I realize 
that California is in major debt, 
according to the deparunent of 
finance, and in that lies a govern-
mental obligation to propose 
sta tcwide budget cuts . But to hit 
the UC system with the burden of 
a $25.4 million budget cut would 
devastate the already lacking areas 
of recreation and studelll interest 
in extracurricular activities. 

ince money is always on UC 
studeills' minds, especially at 
UCSD, the governor's propo cd 
budget cuts will cause an unprece-
dented panic for a selective group 
of the student body, as well as 
some taff members. With curs in 
the UCSD athletic department 
reaching all-time highs, countless 
Hlidenr athletes may be forced to 
immediately raise needed funcl~ or 
run the n k of loslllg their IIldivld-
ual porr for good . 

As ,Ill ex-athlete, I urge the bud-
gct commirree to reconsider ItS 
prioflues In thc face of the 
California budget defiCIt. There 
needs to tJe more student interest 
and opilllon on thc decisions that 
dIrectly effect the students. From 
per anal experience, snldcnt ath-
lete) put 111 so much time and effort 
1Il10 t11cir academic and athletic 

careers that it would he a shame to 
rob them of much-needed funds. 
These funds would allow our ath-
letic teams to continue to represent 
UCSD with excellence.

Guardian lacking in

Editor: 
Featured Op ll110n articles by 

Dustin Frelich have showcased a 
failure by the Guardiall in its 
responsibiliry to prOVIde well-
written, intelligent exploration of 
noteworthy controversy. 

What irks me most when rcad-
ing Mr. Frelichs regular contribu-
tions to the opinon page of the 
Guardian is nor the wTiting itself. 
That he makes me pity conserva-
tives for having him among their 
con utuency, that he eliCIts cringe

sub -tantiated attacks agalllst any-
thing stereotyplcally "liberal," for

in the neck - bow head to read, 
snap head back lip III irritauon, take 
deep breath and repeat in seenting-
Iy endless sequence - these thlllgs

For Tb, UCSD Guardiall, a 
publication that iJoasts a consider-
able reader hip and should serve 
somehow both to educate and 
represenr a large and respected 
university and its hopefully gifted 
students, this is unacceptable. 

I would like to see greater exer-
cise of editorial powers. I believe 
t11at the Gunrdian loses credibility 
as a journalistic enterprise byallow-
ing the publication of lIladequcate-
Iy written, poorly argued pieces. 
(This is especially true when such a 
piece headlines the opinion page.) 

A sound editorial secuon draws 
strength not from radical or out-
rageous opinions on the part of itS 
writers, but how clearly and com-
pellingly they are able to defend 
their positions, however far-
fetched . /\Ir. Freltch ha faded dis-
mally on this account; he IS often

Irish anti-American

Violent acts undermine acts of

though~ 
over a pmt 

I na glorious display of poetic justice, much of {reland' ri ing anti-AmericaniSl1l faced enor-
mous backlash this week. brought on 
by the very people who IIlspired the 
hatred towards the United States. 

In the past month, Shannon 
Airport, just outside Limerick, has 
been the seat of a controversy that 
has headlined the IrISh newspapers 
nearly every day. U.S. aircraft bear-
ing hundreds of troops bound for 
the Middle East have stopped in 
Shannon to refuel. Beca usc these 
troops were in fatigues, undoubtedly 
flymg for military purposes, many 
Irish Joined the outcry that the 
Uruted States was VIolating Ireland's 
con titutionally enforced neutrality. 

With the anger rislIlg because of 
the silence from Taolseach Bettie 
Mern, protesters set up enormous 
tents on the pert meter of the aIrport 
and held large ralites to show their 
dIsgust at both the Imh and 
American governments. One 
Catholic protest group vowed to 
become human hlelds for the peo-
ple of Iraq because Its government, 
III Hent collUSIon with the Uruted 

tates, was not usterung to them. 
Becau~e of Ahern's refusal to 

show rea~on for ICLUng U .. lIuhtJry 

aircraft refuel in hannon, the pro-
testers began to gain publtc sUPl o()n 
and soon the newspaper cdnonJls 
were filled to the brtln WIth articles 
about tyrannical Amencan bulltcs. 

That has all changed thl\ wepi( 
because, like many mindless moils, 
eventually the angcr consume> m 
hosts and they go too far. In this 
case, five protesters cur through the 
fences and arracked an Amencan 
plane with pIckaxes and hovels. The 
damage to the aIrcraft was SIgnificant 
enough to ground the plane. The 
damage to one aIrcraft alone could 
nOt be reason enough for abandon-
ing a:1ti-Amcncanism, but the 
attacks came less than a lVeek after 
"peace" protesters attempted to 
arrack a garda (.In Irish police officer)

all the way to the runway unlun-

one moment when he could explain his posi-
tion without damaging his popularity. With 
thc public realizing that the peace protesters 
are much angricr than intelligent, Ahern 
could wm their trust by being 3 much-need-
ed voice of reason. 

Mern rightly attacked them as hypocrites 
for waving peace signs and then using vio-
lence to pread their agenda. Many politi-
Cians, including oppo i non party mCll1ber~ 
from Fianna Gael, joined in Ahern's condem-
nation. ot surprisingly, the Socialist and 
Labour parties - cven Michael I liggins, the 
Labour Party politician who accused the 
United tates of having a foreign policy filled 
with hate - were quiet on the issue. 

Ahern 5 speech, gi ven at an exposi tion on 
space exploraDon only a few days after thl! 
Columbia disaster, was perfectly timed and 
worded. The first Irish astronaut, a vibrant, 
appealing young woman, has been hired by 
NASA to go on a space mi ion by next year. 
he will, of course, be flying with the Amencan 

crew. l1ms, with signs at the peace camps say-
II1g "I love Iraq, bomb Texas," sympathy for 
Amenca was turned into anger towards the 
111 ensiove peaceniks out at Shannon. 

Regardless, Ahern's cunning, for which he 
is infamous in Ireland, has paid off again. 
With Irish public support behind him, hc 
could now explain why the U .. military 
planes have been refueling in Shannon. 

witilOut military personnel. This lime, the 
Irish public has mostly agrced. 

In fact, the support was enough that Ahern 
then denounced Ireland's police force for being 
wlable to prorect the airport. lie sent ovcr 150 
Irish soldiers to protect Shannon's perimeter. 
The press, originally gi'~ng nods of support to 
tile protesters, were now hounding the peace 
camps over their extremism and polllong out. 
that there is more military now - because 01 
them - rather than less. With this media 
intensity, the peace camp deCided to disballd. 
All the organizaoons tOrc down their tents and

0us camp leaders, were that they wanted to 
avoid the press looking down on them. They 
disbanded because, in the words of one pro-
tester, "\<\Ie want to make sure that the public 
eye stays on the unjust war." . 

111is is ridiculous. [t was because of the VIO-
lence of extreme protesters that the press even 
turned their eye against them, and it was 
becau e of the horrendous reputation the 
peace camps were acculllulating tllat they were

Bookstore: Students seek cheeper option 
wllIinued /rom /lage :l 

Mudenrs," said Moon in the sub-
mission. "We have institu ted sev-
eral programs to make textbooks 
more affordable." 

The submission went on to 
name the methods by which the 
bookstore is tryi ng to red uce 
COSts, slIch as the Save a Million 
campaign, which has saved 
UCSD students $5 million over 
the past three years, according to 
the bookstore. 

Other prices, however, are 
being raised. III early January, the 
UC Board of Regents approved a 
$400-per-year tuition increase, 
along with a second $800 increase 
for the 2003-04 school year. 

John Gamboa, executive direc-
tor of Greenlining Institute, a 
IllInoriry advocacy group and one 
of the pnmary complalllantS, feels 
that nlllel1ls are being gouged for 
more money at one of the worst 
pOSSible limes. 

"Students are facing a $I,200-a-
year Increase m tuition at the 
Ul1Iver iry of California at a time 
when an IIlcreasing number of fam-
ilies arc either our of work or faci ng 
lrunimum wage jobs," he said. 

As a result, the protesters feel 

that high textbook prices are par-
ticularly harmful. 

Yet Moon claims in his sub-
mission to the State Assembly that 
"after expenses, college book-
stores make very little money 011 
selling course matenals." 

Statistically, college book-
stores l11a ke just 4.7 cent on every 
dollar of a textbook price. 

Three big publi hers, Pear 01' 
Education, Thomson Learning 
and McGraw-l lill, account for 62 
percenr of all industry sales. The 
labor department's measure of 
wholesale textbook prices 
increased 65 percent in the past 10 
years, whde overall producer 
prices climbed just II percent. 

Complainants c1,lim that these 
publishers also constantly raISe 
the pnces of new textbooks and 
Issue new editions. 

"I've had professors admit that 
they prefer the older editions." 
Berg said. "[The publishers] don't 
really add anything to the new 
ones." 

The protesting groups offer 
several sol utions, such as provid-
ing Internet alternatives to text-
books \vith online vcr ions of the 
text, and asking the universities to 

distribute their reading lI~ts to 
private booksellers who are unaf-
filiated with the univer Ity to sup-
POrt competition. 

Turk feels that there are 
already many ways that students 
can take the initiative to save 
money on books. 

"The primary way students 
[can] pay less for textbooks is to 
hop early and purchase used 

copies," Turk said. "Snldents can 
also save by looking for discounts 
in the UCSD Bookstore, the 
General Store, the Revelle Book 
Exchange or online - and by par-
ticipating in peer-to-peer text-
book exchanges." 

The complainants, however, 
feel that there IS a problem that 
needs to be solved. 

"We now call upon [Atkinson] 
to be a leader in addreSSing the 
high cost or books, Including the 
big publisher oligopoly that artifi-
Cially raises wholesale textbook 
prices," Gamboa said. 

The complamants desire a 
meeting with Pre ident Atkinson 
and Chancellor Reed in the next 
two weeks to discuss the forma-
tion of a committee to 'concen-
trate on textbook price reduction.

speaker

found what was 
said informative. 

'·It 's Interestmg 
Forouzanden, a 
senior at Marshall and chairman of 
the UCSD Freedom Alliance. 

In a speech about what it 
means to be American, Palisol 
said that the United tates needs 
to be vigilant in protecting its 
freedoms. 

"Our responsibility is to defend 
freedom at any cost, and this oblig-
ation cannot be taken lightly," 
PaIisol said. 

He also referenced the pos Ibtl-
ity of war with Iraq, saying the U.S. 
must e.xercise responsibility. 

"As citizens, we ask that our 
leaders act III a responsible man-
ner and that they choose war as 
the last option. Ilowever, if they 
do, we must support our friends 
and family as they fight for our 
freedom, our liberry, and our pur-
suit of happiness ," said Palisol, in 
his peech. 

Pali ol's speech was interrupted 

to hear omcone 
speak about current I sues that 
have more different ... more diver e 
opinions than my profes or," he 
said. 

James Cowling, an internati onal 
studen t from Australia, sa id he 
appreciated the forum. 

"I don 't agree wah the pro-war 
argument, but I think that It IS 
good for them to l'Olce their opin-
ions in J public forum, " he ~aid . 
"Perhaps If we coultl be rcspecong 
other people '; OpinIOnS, we would-
n't be gOing to war." 

AI Canata, tr easu rer of the 
College Repubhcans, felt the rally 
met the group's expectations. 

"I think It IS about the same 
quality in terms of what we were 
lryll1g to put out to the crowd and 
to the UCSD campus, which Wd ,

I Ie emphasi7.cd the impact of 
sociohistorical and instimtional 
forces on students and claimed 
that cha nging admission rates 
was not the only tep for improv-
ing campus divcrsity. 

"Most institutions focus on 
only one clement of the fight ... 
on increasing the numbers of 
racial ethnic students on the col-
lege campu." Milem said. 
"Although this is an important 
first step in the process. it cannot 
be the only step in the process. 
There are other key clements that 
require anention." 

Grace Carroll. the as ociate 
director at Iloward's University 
Center for the Research on the 
Education of Smdents Placed at 
Risk. discussed the ocial stress 
that minorities face at universitie 
as a result of their ethnicity. 

"Often. one of the big issues 
around communities of color or 
low-income fami lies is that 
they' re perceptive that there's no 
safety net," Ca rroll said. "You 
mess up, and you go back into 
the vast void of all the sterc0typ-
ic images that people hold Ilf 
your community." 

Margaret Bonous-Hammarth, 
a research associate at UCLA. 
presented her research on the role 
of organizations. coalitions and 
agencies in promoting campus 
diversity. 

"If one piece of your diversity 
plan fails for outreach and 
recruitment. the publtc out there 
is not going to perceive [it as]. 
'Oh' It's only one littl e piece.' 
The public perception is that 
UC 0 IS not a welcoming insti-
tution for folks outside of paruc-
ular culture groups." Bonous-
Hammarth said.

Discussing diversity: - [Diversity] really has to be a part of everything we do. It has 
to be a part of our fiber; said Chancellor Robert C Dynes at the Feb. 7 summil 

tions. tho e present at the summit 
split off into four groups for a short 
roundtable session. During these 
sessions. the groups addressed the 
challenges and patterns of racia l 
interaction at UCSD. as well as 
strategies to create a "more affir-
mative development environ-
ment." 

Despite the efforts character-
ized by the summer. many felt that 
there were still other steps to be 
taken toward impro~ng campus 
diversity. 

"I think the fact that even this 
is not the end of it is a good 
sign," said Ross Frank. an as oci-
ate professor of ethnic smdies at 
UCSD. 

Dynes aid that diversity needs 
to be incorporated more rcaddy 
into the unl\'erslty community. 

"Diversity in higher educa-
tion should not be relegated to 
programs here and an event 

there." Dynes said. "It really has 
to be a part of everything we tlo. 
It has to be a part of our fiber; it 
has to be a part of our infrastruc-
ture." 

Harpeet Singh. a senior at 
Thurgood Marshall College and 
vice president of the African-
American Snldent Union. felt the 
time had been worthwhile anti 
well-spent. 

"I think [the conference] was 
positive interaction." he said . 
"Relative to other diversity events 
that I've been to, I think tillS IS 
one of the hetter evell ts."

In deciding a major. a career or even

a key consideration IS always whether or 
not it's something worthwhile. or 
whether or not it will have any sort of 
impact. In a lecmre jointly sponsored by 
lhe Warren College Law and Society 
program and the California Western 
Law School. Mary Schroeder. chief 
judge of the U.S. District Court of 
Appeafs for the 9th Clrclllt. attempted to

What i Y ur ideal Valentine's Day? 

Law: Lecturer speaks to 
students on political careers 

cominued from p(lge 9 
laughs as well as laments. She ulti-
mately focused on what she comid-
ers to be the two major impacts of 
women in th c legal profession, 
namely mobility and flexibility, 
mcaning the increased ability to 
move from one firm to another and 
the fluidity of career goals. Before 
women formed a presence as 
lawyers, people stayed at one firm 
and strove for a mall number of 
elevated positions. Now lawyers 
switch from one firm to another 
quite regularly and can be expected 
to achieve any number of positions. 

of female lawyers will extend to a 
situation where "the oath of office 
will be administered hy a woman 
supreme coun chief Justice to a 
woman president."

Although Schroeder agreed that 
there is "still a structured hierar-
chy" within the legal profession, 3S 
a result of the increase of practicing 
female lawyers, that tructure is 
"much less trati fied." 

Schroeder's aspirations for 
women in the legal profe sion go 
well beyond her own achievements. 
Recognizing that only 20 percent 
of justices are women, chroeder 
said that there are possibilities 
within the United States, and also 
sees opportunities (or advancement 
in "cultures where women are 
regarded as po ession by hu-
bands and fathers." 

Believing that the legal profes-
ion serves as an example for OUler 

fields, Schroeder said that there is a 
need for aerion legally, politically 
and socially to "give an as ist to 
those who ask for assistance in pro-
tecting women from the violence 
and dcgrad~tio:: they receive in 
other countries. 

Bur there is a peeific dream 
thar Schroeder has for women in 
the legal profeSSion. Recognizing 
that such a goal will take some time 
before being realized, chroeder 
hopes that eventually the mfluence 

The lecture was one in a series 
of Law and Society prCSCnlatlOn~, 
all of which hal'e different aims as 
far as speaker and cOlllcnt. For 
Schroeder's t:llk, the program's 
sponsors were "hoping she would 
get into current case law where 
women arc making a difference or 
may have some kind of impact in 
the future," said Barbara Sanchez, 
program director of the Law and 
Society program. 

The lecture served nor only as 
an information session for political 
cicnce srudenrs, bur also for 

women curious about the impact 
they personally could have in tak-
ing the law as a profession. 

"I'm interested in going to law 
school," aid Jenny Iloang, an 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more. "I thought it'd be interest -
ing to see if there's a point of 
being a woman in law. It's differ-
ent than hearing a man talk about 
it. "

conte t with a l3 -game winning 
streak all the line. 

And that streak remained intact. 
The Tritons committed 27 
turnovers and couldn't stop the 
Roadrunner' balanced attack while 
CSU Baker field outscored UC D 
by 11 and [7 points in the first and 
econd halves, respectivciy, for an 

easy 5-57 win. 
"They're just a better team than 

we are," said UCSD head coach 
Judy 1alone. "Our goal was to 
hold Heather Garay and IDiane] 
Dittburner belDw their season 
averages and make other people 
beat u , and they did." 

For CSU Bakersfield, five play-
ers scored 111 double figures . 
Roadrunners' center Gara)" the 
nation's second-leadlllg sorer, had 
16 points Jnd a game-htgh 13 
rebounds in the contest. 

"That 's thc mark of a good 
teJm," ,\!alone aid of C U 
Bakersfield's balanced sCDn ng. " I f 
)'ou're goi ng to be :l nationally 
ranked team, then you're gomg to

ric) add insult to In)ury, the 
Tritons also lost thell' thml -lcadll1 l(

Injury during the game. 

On Feu. 8, the Tntons traveled 
to Turlock, Caltf., to face CSU

first half, scoring 14 points. 

The game was stili in questiol1 
when UC D had the ball with 28 
seconds remaining and trailing by 
three at 73·70. 

"We ran a tnple screen to get a

But the Tmons couldn't convert 
and were forced to foul. After 
another failed offenSive try, UCSD 
fouled again . CSU lanislaus Illade

game at 77-70.

production for the Tri tons. 

Cal HaptlSt limited UCSO's 
>corlllg by holdll1g it to Just five 
hilS in the game. 

'ceding a cohesive UnIt 10 play, 
the lrirons struggled to find the 
key to victory. 

"We're all just trying too hard," 
anders saId . "We are trying so 

hard to do so much , instead of each 
person focusi ng individually to do 
their own thll1g." 

The second gamc of the double-
header was much like the first. Cal 
BaptISt scored all of its nine runs In 
the fourth innIng to again defeat 
UCSD 9-4 . 

CSD freshman Jose Navarru 
got hIS first start as a Triton, throw-
Ing J.l Inlllngs, giving up six runs 
on four hIts and ~king the 105s to 
fall to (0-2) on the season . 

Cal Bapo t put up mne runs on 
seven hits III the fourth inning. 

The lhtons scored a run In the 
fOllrth inl1lng, one in the fifth and 

then two more in the nmth . 
After droppIng thclr fourth -

straight game, the Tritons fell to 2-
4 in their non onferencc schedule. 

"RIght now Ithe team] I;' acting 
like a team that i;. sti ll trylllg to fig-
ure ou( whether thcy are good or 
not, instead of tru ting their ability 
and knowing that they arc a good , 
solid bJIl club. This could be a very 
POSIUI'C thmg for us. It' better to 
learn carly 111 the yea r about your 
character than It is late in the ycar," 
O'Bnen sa Id. "AdverSity early in a 
season ca n be a very good thing If It 

I~ channeled correctly. It's Illipor-
t31lt to get through sOlllcthlllg like 
thIS because II WIll teach U~ how to 
handle it m the future." 

Though dl appOinted III this 
week's ouongs, UCS[) IS confidcnt 
that it Will bounce back. 

"Wc'lI find the nghr combll1a -

for the whole day." 

Riddlc commented on what he 
thinks the team need to improve 
on before league play starts. 

"We've just got to come out and 
compete," he said. "We've got to 
show up to the yard ready to play. 

omeumes we get 3 litne lax and let 
the other team affect us. But, we 
are an awesome team with solid 
hitters and great pilehers. It's just 
about how we approach the game 
mentally." 

[n addition to Cremidan (I-l), 
UCSO used five other pitchers. 

"I thought the bullpen threw 
well today," O'Brien said . "We had 
some guys get their first college 
innings. J was most impressed with 
their composure on the mound ."
