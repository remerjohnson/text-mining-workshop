Associate News Editor 

Friday night marked the opening of 
UCSD's new live entertainment venue, "Club 
Ritmo; which featured headliner Tone Loc 
with special guest Candyman. 

The event, sponsored by the A.S. Council, 
took place from 8:30 p.m. to midnight at the 
Stage at Porter's Pub. 

After arriving at approximately 10:30 p.m., 
Tone Loc took the stage to perfonn perenni-
al favorites and his two most famous songs, 
"Wild Thing" and "Funky Cold Medina." 

Eisha Christian, A.S. co-assistant commis-
sioner of programming and one of Club 
Ritmo's main coordinators, was enthusiastic 
about its initial success. 

"The club did awesome for its opening 
night: Christian said. "I had tons of people 
come and say they loved the idea that Friday 
nights were going to be a happening place at 
the Pub." 

A.S. Production Manager Steve Evans 
monitored the club's ticket count that night 

and con finned its high turnout. 
Evans reported that attendance averaged 

approximately 500 people throughout the 
night. Toward the time of Tone Loc's perfor-
mance, the number increased as Porter's Pub ' 
neared its maximum capacity, with almost 700 
people in attendance. 

"It was a packed house and there was a 
really early crowd from the start - the perfect 
amount of people, really; Evans said. "A very 
large majority of the people were UCSD stu-
dents." 

Opening for the band were DJs from 
UCSD's DJs and Vinylphiles Club and the rap 
group L.A. Symphony. 

Christian expressed her appreciation of all 
the night's talent, especially L.A. Symphony 
for extending their performance, as Tone Loc 
arrived later than expected. 

"They all did an awesome job," Christian 
said. "But the response for L.A. Symphony 
was huge."

Power Crisis Hits 
UCSD, Threatens 
Rolling Blackouts 
Entire campus asked to 
conserve electricity 
By PAR •• A BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The power crisis that left thousands of 
Californians in the dark during the past week 
has forced UCSD to prepare for the possibility 
of rolling blackouts. 

Wendy Schiefer, manager of customer rela-
tions at Physical Plant Services, said the UCSD 
campus is in electrical stage three emergency, 
which means there is a threat to the electrical 
system reliability and an increased possibility 
of the campus experiencing rolling power out-
ages. 

Schiefer says that under stage three emer-
gency, students should reduce electrical 
usage as much as possible and refrain from 
any sensitive research that requires electrical 
power. 

Schiefer, who is living in the dark and with-
out heat due to skyrocketing energy bills, said 
she believes it will take an actual blackout to 
get students to conserve. 

"Some people may not take the energy 
crisis seriously," Schiefer sa iq. "But they may 
find out the hard way when the power goes 
out." 

Yolanda Trevino, assistant resident dean of 
Marshall college, said all the colleges have 
taken steps to inform residents of the need to 
conserve energy. 

"We've sent out e-mails and community 
bulletins to residents, asking them to con-
serve energy as much as possible; Trevino 
said. "because during blackouts there is no 
heat and no electricity and the elevators will 
shut off." 

Trevino said that the resident life offices are 
asking students to turn off their personal 
computers when they are not in use, back up 
all computer files, turn off extra lights, and to 
have flashlights and fresh batteries on hand. 

Roosevelt sophomore Susan Liem, an on-
campus resident, is concerned about the power 
crisis. 

"I try to do my part by turning off extra 
lights and the heat," Liem said. 

However, she said that sh~ does not think 
many students are taking the energy crisis seri-

UCSD Researchers to Address Cliff Erosion 
A sea grant will help engineers stabilize San Diego's many endangered bluffs 
By .OFF DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

The National Oceanographic 
and Atmospheric Administration 
is teaming up with UCSD to create 
a comprehensive guide to cliff sta-
bilization methods. 

Structural engineers at the 
Jacobs School of Engineering 
received a $125,000 Sea Grant 
from NOAA, which was matched 
by UCSD for a total of $250,000 to 
conduct a project' titled 
"Mitigation of Coastal Bluff 

Insta~i1ity in San Diego County, 
California." 

UCSD undergraduates will 
work with engineers and graduate 
students at the Jacobs School on 
the project, which has significant 
local implications. 

The study will examine how to 
best stabilize cliffs while keeping 
impact on the natural environ-
ment to a minimum, and deter-
mine the best way to slow and stop 
current cliff instability. 

"We are approaching a crisis in 
San Diego County; said Scott 
Ashford, project leader and profes-
sor of geotechnical engineerin$ at 
the Jacobs School of Engineenng, 
referring to the stability of coastal 

cliffs. 
Ashford also noted that 80 per-

cent of San Diego's 80 mi les of 
coastline are cliffs. 

Destabilization of the cliffs and 
bluffs occurs due to factors such 
as waves, vegetation and human 
development. 

Recent storms have shown that 
efforts to stop erosion from 
pulling human development into 
the ocean have come too late for 
an effective remedy. 

"It's obvious that a major prob-
lem exists, but repairs are typically 
only approved in emergency situa-
tions because of concerns over 

damaging the bluffs or destroying 
the natural beauty of the coast-
line," Ashford said. 

Ashford summarized the pro-
ject by saying, "Our major goal is 
to pinpoint the most efficient and 
effective ways to resolve this grow-
ing crisis, while maintaining the 
environmental integrity of the 
landscape." 

The project is divided into 
three phases. 

The first phase consists of ana-
lyzing aerial photos of San Diego's 
cliffs. Photos of past and present

"We're pretty honored just to open

gonna give them a great show." 

On opening night, Cassandra 
Williams, A.S. commissioner of pro-

player in the development of Club 
Ritmo, credi ted Christian and Ferasat 
for being there from the start in Club 
Ritmo's evolution. 

"I give them mad props just for 
getting here. to this point where they 
got a club open on campus," Williams 
said. "Tonight is for Eisha and'Anahita 
to j uSt be in the clouds because 
they've helped in creating a buzz

campus-wide night club were always 
present among A.S. members in one

"I see people leave their lights on 
all the time and turn up the heater 
very high," Liem said. "I don 't think 
students will take it seriously as long 
as they live on campus because they 
don't pay the electricity bills." 

Marshall sophomore Brandon Ito, 
also an on-campus resident, said his 
efforts to conserve have been thwarted 
by his roommates. 

" I have tried to conserve energy 
over the past week, but it seems like I 
always shut all the lights off in the 
apartment only to come home to them 
all on again," Ito said. " I know that my 
roommates and neighbors have no 
will to save energy, as they keep their 
lights on constantly." 

Ito said that even though the 
ca mpus has yet to experience rolling 
blackouts, it is important fo r every-
one to do their part and conserve 
energy. 

" I'm not an environmenta list or 
conservationist by any means, but I 
believe that we've reached a sense of 
urgency that needs to be attended 
to," Ito said. "And it's partly because I 
feel bad for all the little kids that are 
home alone when their lights go 
out." 

Ito said he is bothered by the fact 
that the lights in many lecture halls 
and buildings remain on through the 
night. 

" I think it's absolutely ridiculous 
and the greatest source of energy loss 
that a lot of the lecture halls and 
buildings around campus have their 
lights left on the entire night," Ito 
said . 

With the UCSD campus renown 
for its research and medical commu-
nities, measures have been taken to 
prevent the possibility of power loss to 
render any effect on their work. 

Kim McDonald, UCS D director of 
science communications, sa id the 
biology division has taken steps to 
inform the labs to be prepared in the 
event of power outage and to con-
serve energy as much as possible. 

"We've warned all the labs that 
they should make sure that cr iti ca l 
equipment is on emergency circuits," 
McDonald said . "Most of the lab

BRIEFLY 
UC Reviews Breast Cancer Report 

The UC Board of Regents reviewed a report 
Thursday that stated that breast cancer still 
claims the lives of too many California women. 

Marion Kavanaugh-Lynch, the director of the 
California Breast Cancer Research program, pre-

s~nted the "Status of Breast Cancer in 
California,· which claimed that 15,000 
California women diagnosed with breast cancer 
this year will still be alive in 10 years due to 
early detection, but 6,000 others will die within 
that same 10-year period. 

The study performed by the program also 
found that women usually die from the disease 
because they did not receive early screening and 
their cancer· was advanced beyond the point of 
treatment when detected. 

The California Breast Cancer Research 
Program is managed by the UC Office of the 
President, which also awarded money to 70 new 
projects in this research field over the last year. 

UC Improves employee 
retirement plan 

The UC Board of Regents updated its retire-
ment benefits on Thursday by improving "age 
factors· in the UC Retirement Plan. 

The changes take place effective Jan. 1, 
2001 and are expected to make employment 
with the university more appealing to prospec-
tive workers. 

The updated factors will begin at 1.1 percent 
at age 50 and will increase incrementally each 
year by 0.14 percentage points. The factors will 
be between 1 percent and 20 percent higher 
than the previous factors. 

The university does not antic ipate an 
increased rate of retirements as a result of the 
plan but does expect to retain older employees 
as their accrued retirement adds up. 

The initiative is just one in a long line of 
adjustments made in an effort to make the uni-
versity increasingly competitive in California's 
growing job market. 

Applications now available for 
new student regent 

Student regent applications are now avail-

able in the A .S. offices on the third floor of the 
Price Center. 

Qualificat ions for the poSition include under-
graduate, graduate or professional student 
enrollment status. The job requires a two-year 
commitment. 

Benefits of the position include free parking 
on all UC campuses, paid mandatory university 
fees, paid travel expenses and a resume boost-
er. 

An information session will be held Thursday, 
Feb. 15 at 1 p.m. on Library Walk .

PINION 

The 

Making 
Ari,°erican 

Presi 

Despite what Democrats, liberals and other critics say, 
President Bush is amply qualified far the office 
By RYAN DARBY 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Well folks, it looks like spring clean-
ing has come early this year. Just as many 
of us have been cleaning our rooms, the 
American people have tossed the rubbish 
out of the White House. Indeed, the air is 
much better today than it has been for 
the last eight years. 

Although the Democratic Party and 
Jesse "Rent-a-Mob n Jackson tried their 
hardest to steal the presidential election, 
Bush rightfully emerged victorious. I can-
not say their ·behavior was unexpected: 
After all , these are the same people who 
murdered Vince Foster, who sold nuclear 
secrets to communist China and who, at 
every opportunity, have done their best to 
deceive the American people while pur-
suing their own corrupt agenda. 

What saddens me is that these people 
have been hurling mud at President 
George W. Bush for weeks, trying to sour 
his presidency before he was even sworn 
in. What is even worse is that many 
believe these lies. That's why talk show 
host Michael Savage has dubbed most 
liberals as "sheeple." They are like sheep, 
following a leader without questioning 
his motives. 

But this is UCSD. If you're here, then 
you're too smart to fall for their lies. 

Democrats want you to believe that 
Bush's victory is illegitimate because it 
was by such a small margin . Newsflash, 
America: It doesn't matter whether he 
won by two votes or 20 million votes; 
Bush still won. 

Democrats want you to believe that 
not all ballots were counted. That's obvi-

ously not the case, because all votes were 
counted, some twice, and in some places, 
as many as four times. 

Remember how loudly the liberals 
yelled for a hand recount of the thou-
sands of so-called undervotes in Miami-
Dade County, while sensible Republi-
cans said that those people simply didn't 
vote for a presidential candidate? Well , 
the Palm Beach Post hand-counted the 
votes and largely confirmed-its hunch by 
reporting that 75 percent of the ballots 
had no markings for any presidential 
candidates, 20 percent had markings for 
more than one candidate, and only 5 per-
cent showed some marking for a candi-
date. And guess what? Bush actually 
gained six votes in this recount. 

Gore actually lost ground with this 
recount. I personally cannot wait until all 
the votes in Florida are recounted so we 
can see just how large Bush's margin of 
victory really was. Not that the truth 
matters to the Democratic Party. 

It's particularly funny to me that lib-
erals claim Bush is dumb by poking fun 
at his Texan accent and heritage. They 
say he 's slow. Well, I've read about anoth-
er president who was considered stupid 
by opponents. A very slow speaker, he 
was referred to by some as the "Dumb 
Ox." History books refer to him as Abra-
ham Lincoln. 

Others claim Bush's inexperience will 
doom him. Clinton seemed to do all 
right for himself after being the governor 
of "The Wal-Mart State." One "inexperi-
enced" president stands out in my mind. 
He was sworn in during a terrible reces-

I)' SIMONE I ANnNI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The selection of a cabinet is the first 
politically relevant act, after the electoral 
season of rhetoric and demagogy (but 
does that season ever really end?), a pres-
ident-elect is called upon to do. 
Although very unspecified, the cabinet 
selection can reveal much about the pel' 
sonality of the new president and about 
the collective personality of the new 
administration. 

In other words: So far President 
George W. Bush has only talked (often in 
open disregard for grammar and logic 
alike), but now his time for action has 
come, and we can judge on a more factu-
al ground the man that America had the 
foolishness to elect u its president, 

If the remainder of the Bush presi-
dency will be in any way inspired by his 
fil'5t political acts as a president-elect, it is 
clear that the ·compassionate conser-
vatism· lasted shorter than an unsuc-
cessful sitcom, and that the presidency of 
Bush Jr. will be inspired by the bygone 
Reagan era in its soc~1 and political doc-
trines. It will be. in other words, much 
more conservative than it appeared from 
anything we saw in the campaign. 

It is not easy to predict the course of 
a presidency at such an early stage, but, if 
I may venture such a prediction, one of 

the results of the Bush presidency will be 
a strong reduction of the international 
role and stature of the United States. 
Among those that we still euphemistical-
ly call "our allies: Bush already has one 
of the lowest reputations of any presi-
dent in this (sorry - last) century. 

It may sound strange to !he average 
American, but internationally Bush is 
mostly known for the appalling number 
of executions in Texas, and for refusing 
to pardon people condemned under the 
most incrtdible circumstances. Bush has 
had no international experience whatso-
ever. As far as I know, he has' left the 
United States only three times in his life, 
and never in any officiaT capacity. Con-
sidering his years as the governor of a 
state on the Mexican border, this is quite 
a feat, I doubt he has any real grasp of the 
current international arena, beyond 
those few catch phrases that got him 
elected. 

His ideas on the role of the U.S. mili-
tary reflect his lack of understanding of 
the modem world. He still seems con-
vinced that the Soviet Union (or, maybe 
those sly Canadians) will attack the Unit-
ed States, and does not seem to under-
stand the profound change that took 
place in the last 10 years in the balance 
between military and economic influence.

n Doesn't Take a Rocket Scientist No Love Affair Between Bush, Gays 

ARNEl GUIANG 

I always hear pieces of the ongoing argument regarding the hard sciences 'vs. the 
social sciences. Based on person-
al experience, I can say it is far 
more difficult and time-consum-
ing to be an engineer. I am a com-
puter engineering major with a 
minor in political science. I feel I 

_ can make this argument because 
I've been in both types of classes. 

Social scientists often com-
plain about the difficulty of their 
majors. For instance, there are a 
large number of people who 
think it is hard to be an econom-
ics or a psychology major. They 
think that courses such as the 
ECON 120 sequence are so hard 
allfl time-consuming. What both-
ers me most is that they think 
these classes are comparable to 
engineering classes. These com-
plaints sound petty to me. I don't 
think that the classes are really 
comparable. Engineers have the 
really hard courses and, in gener-
al, the harder curriculum. 

I agree that certain social sci-
ence classes may be competitive, 
in that it is hard to earn an A, but 
it is in no way as challenging or 
time consuming as a serious 
engineering course. . 

I want to make it clear: At 
UCSD, the engineers prevail. 
The academic difficulty level for 
engineers far exceeds the diffi-
cufty level of any social science 
major. Engineers spend more 

time on their classes than most 
social scientists. 

A social scientist just reads 
and writes. A social scientist 
rarely has to retain knowledge 
from an earlier course to do well 
in a course that follows. Most 
social science majors are just 
extensions of history with a 
touch of t.:riticism and argument. 
As long as you know how to 
write and you keep up with the 
material, you can pass a social 
science class. 

between 22 and 27 courses for 
their major. Computer engineers 
are required to take more than 35 
courses. Bioengineers are 
required to take more than 40 
courses to graduate. Do the 
math. Do you social scientists 
see the difference? Why do you 
complain? 

Gay community should be wary of new 
president's policies and appointments 

For an engineer, the material 
from prerequisite courses really 
determines the outcome of your 
future classes. For instance, how 
can you do well in Physics 2D 
without having ever taken 
Physics 2A? How can you do well 
in Math 21 D without having ever 
take Math 20A? How can you 
code a compiler without knowing 
what a data structure is? 

If I had to rank academic dif-
ficulty, engineers have the hard-
est curriculum at UCSD. The 
hard science majors, such as bio 
and chemistry, have a curriculum 
with medium difficulty. Last, the 
social scientists, such as econom-
ics and political science majors, 
have the easiest time. I consider 
the curriculum of other majors 
such as economics or political 
science to be trivially difficult 
compared with science or engi-
neering majors. 

Let's compare some depart-
ment curriculum requirements 
in terms of numbers. Let's not 
consider general education 
requirements. Economics majors 
are required to take roughly 17 
courses. Political science majors 
are required to take 16 courses. 
Biology majors have to take 

It takes 180 units (45 classes) 
to graduate. Social scientists have 
enough time left over for things 
called electives. Most of the 
social scientists actually have to 
take electives in order to hit 180 
units. Social scientists have time 
to pursue minors or double 
majors. It is even possible for a 
social science major to graduate 
in three years. 

Most of the engineers do not 
take electives, unless it is for 
fun . It is highly unlikely for an 
engineer to graduate in three 
years due to the curriculum 
requirements. • . 

As a result of the easier cur-
riculum, social science majors get 
to have more time and a more 
relaxed schedules. If social sci-
ence majors were required to take 
more than 30 classes for their 
majors, I suppose I wouldn't be 
ranting about this issue. 

In my opinion, the difficulty 
level of a social science major 
and that of an engineering 
major are not even comparable. 
The curriculum alone high-
lights why it is harder to be an 
engineer and easier to be a 
social scientist. 

I know a lot of you social sci-
entists think differently and 
might be a little outraged. Let 
me know your opinion so we 
can print it. Send a comment to 
the editor.

Staff Writer 

It makes me cringe to know 
that such an ignorant little man 
will be leading our country for the 
next four years. I don 't see how 
President George W. Bush ca n ca ll 
himself a compassionate conserva-
tive when he aims to hurt 10 per-
cent of the population. 

The Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
Against Defamation, GLAAD, and 
other gay organizations have been 
fueling the anti-Bush fire since the 
beginning of his campaign. Their 
most successful anti-Bush adver-
tising has been the publicizing of 
his shackling, hurtful policies 
toward gays and lesbians. 

He opposes same-sex marriage. 
He does not even want to allow 
same-sex couples to adopt chil -
dren. The Dallas Morning News 
quoted him saying, "I believe chil-
dren ought to be adopted in fami-
lies with a woman and man who 
are married." 

He supports the military's 
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, as 
shown by his cabinet nomination 
of Gen. Colin Powell, who was the 
creator of that policy. He opposes 
hate-crime legislation, which 
would be used for such cases as 
Matthew Shepard's. 

Dubya's most eloquent state-
ment is the following as collected 
by The Dallas Morning News: "The 
next president must fight against 
discrimination, but I think we can 
do so with'out special treatment of 
people." It's interesting because the

context in which he says this 
regards employment nondiscrimi-
nation . With that statement, he 
decided to solve the problem of 
discrimination agai nst gay and les-
bian emplOyees by ignoring it. 

His policy is repulsive when it 
comes to AIDS and health carc. 
Bush is an opponent of funding fo r 
AIDS health care. During his term, 
the Texas Department of Health 
began a name- report ing program 
for people with HIV (see 
hNp://www.planetout.com fo r infor-
mation). That it is possibile to find 
out if someone has a disease is a 
complete invasion of privacy. 

With that information, one 
would think that all openly gay peo-
ple would have voted for AI Gore in 
the past election. However, accord-
ing to www. Planetout.com. 25 percent 
of openly gay voters voted for Bush. 

Planetout columnist Michelan-
gelo Signorele stated that this is a 
ceiling not a floor, because no one 
knows how many gays were unwill-
ing to declare their sexuality at the 
polls. Considering that so much of 
America consists of linle backwater 
towns in the middle of nowhere, 
that is a low, low cei ling. Obvious-
ly, if you lived in one of those 
towns, you might not be comfort-
able with your homosexuality. 

One might ask, why would any-
one who is gay vote Republican to 
begin with? Some have suggested 
that the absence of a positive pro-
gression of gay rights legislation by 
the Democratic president in the last

His name is Ronald Reagan,

condemning his presidency. We 
are certainly bener off with him in 
office than AI Gore. 

If the American people pros-

of this success, the people who 
earned this money or the federal 
government? It should be given 
back to the people, of course. 

We are a capitalist society. The 
rules arc simple. Work as hard as 
you can to earn as much as you 
can. So if our hard work has result-
ed in a federal budget surplus, then

eight years has caused many frus-
trated gay Democrats to vote Bush. 

The same-sex marriage bill was 
not passed and the "Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell" military bill was. This 
caused a lot of frustration. Cur-
rently, there is even a small con-
tingent of gay Republicans called 
the "Log Cabin Republicans." 

A lot of older gays and lesbians 
could have voted Republican for 
economic reasons. Many gay and 
lesbians couples are known as 
DI Ks, or "Double Income, No 
Kids." They do not have the tax 
advantages that come with mar-
riage, so they would want to be 

why should the government claim 
the extra money it took from us? 

Bush's plan is very simple: If 
you pay income taxes, then you 
will receive a tax cut. Low- and 
middle-income workers will 
receive the biggest tax cut. Every-
one will benefit from this. More 
importantly, the sinking economy 
Clinton left us with will receive a 
vital boost because people will use 
this extra money to buy more 
products and invest directly into 
the market. 

Democrats will lead you to 
believe that Bush's prior bouts 
with alcoholism make him unfit 
for the presidency. This could not 
be any further from the truth, as it 
shows his strength far more than 
his weakness. Bush admits that he 
is an alcoholic, but the main thing 
is that he has stopped drinking. 
Most people are simply not strong 
enough to stop, yet Bush managed 
to do so. It is a perpetual battle for 
him. He will always be tempted to 
take that one drink that will tum 

taxed as Ii ttle as possible. Beca use 
these couples don't have kids, they 
have a larger amount of dispos-
able income and therefore want 
less of it taken away. Republican 
emphasis on low taxes for those in 
higher tax brackets would benefit 
most DINKs. 

Many say that blc:tant discrim-
ination and the predicted sinking 
economy will contribute to a 
quick four-and-out for Bush. This 
would possibly cause the next 
president to be Democrat. Sup-
posedly, Dubya will leave such a 
bad taste in voters' mouths that 
they will be eager to elect a Demo-
crat, preferably Hillary Clinton, 
for the following eight years. 

Bush will hurt gays in ways 
that have yet to be discussed. The 
obvious way he will affect gay 
rights is with his appointments to 
the Supreme Court. The less obvi-

into many. Yet he obviously has 
the strength to fight this tempta-
tion, and that speaks volumes of 
his true character. 

Democrats certainly have no 
basis for condemning morals. 
Where should I start? The "Rev-
erend" Jesse Jackson justadmined 
to fathering a child outside of his 
wife's company. Witnesses have 
come forth alleging that Gore 
used to be an outrageous dope 
fiend . Clinton apparently smoked 
a few joints too, but "didn't 
inhale." Right, and Monica was 
just trying to perform CPR. 

One of the nastiest lies the 
Democrats will tell you is that 
Bush will take away a woman's 
right to choose. Lies, lies, lies. 
While Bush feels that abortion is 
morally wrong, he has no inten-
tion of trying to outlaw it. People 
who claimed otherwise were 
merely trying to scare you into 
voting for Gore. 

But you were too smart to fall 
for their lies, right? 

ous way he will affect gay rights is 
his thousands of appointments in 
the executive branch . Those thou-
sands of appointments will be lit-
tle personal additions to the feder-
al government, and each one will 
have its own effect on the work-
ings of the government. 

The most representational 
gauge of how things will go 
between Bush and gays for the next 
four years may be seen in how the 
Bush administration handles Linda 
Cheney, the out-lesbian daughter 
of Vice President Dick Cheney. 

Or rather, how it does not han-
dle her. Whenever the media asks 
a member of the Bush administra-
tion about Linda, the reply is "no 
comment." I can assure you that 
will be the reply for the next four 
years concerning gay and lesbian 
issues. 

No comment.

The most important influences 
of the Bush administration will, 
however, be fel t within the country. 
The case has been made, and well 
documented, that the Bush presi-
dency will signal a step back in 
social policy, possibly a serious 
degrade in our already-failing 
health care system and a deeper 
division between the wealthy and 
the poor. I would like to note in 
addition to this that the election of 
Bush signals, in a sense, the end of 
American politics as we knew it. 

We have known for a long time 
that elections are essentially won by 
money, and that strong special inter-
ests always manage to get politicians 
elected. We know, as Bill Bradley said 
in an interview with National Public 
Radio, that today politicians are con-
stantly in "election mode," and that 
they spend most of their time raising 
money and trying to appease the 
people who give them that money. 

To some extent, however, it was 
impossible to believe that behind 
all this, some remnant of true poli-
tics, of the ideals which should 
inspire public service, would still 
survive. Now that we have elected a 
president who, according to his 
own supporters, is completely 
inadequate to lead the country, 
whose only goal was to continue 
policies outdated by to years and 
who has been quite openly placed 
in the White House to serve special 
interests, this illusion cannot be 

Monday, January 22, 2001 

sustained anymore. We have, in a 
very real sense, ceased to be a 
democracy in order to become an 
economic aristocracy. 

Bush's first acts as president pro-
ject a dark image of what the Bush 
administration will be: radically 
conservative in its social policy, iso-
lationist in the international arena, 
strongly influenced by industrial 
special interest and characterized by 
an unprecedented prominence of 
Christian fundamentalism. Irt other 
words, throughout his centrist elec-
toral campaign Bush has, to use an 
expression dear to the conservative 
heart, lied to the American people. 
Somehow, this time we were sup-
posed to think that lying was not 
such a bad thing. 

Democrats should take note, 
since the Bush presidency might 
finally be a good occasion to retali-
ate for the behavior of the Republi-
cans during the Clinton years. 

We must realize that wh ile we 
were constantly trying to take the 
high road, the Republi.cans closed 
it, dismantled it and sold the parts 
for scrap. If we can learn the 
Republican lesson of all-out, no-
holds-barred political fighting, of 
playing dirty and then crying foul 
at the first attempt of retaliation, of 
scrounging all possible dirt and 
using it to the fullest extent of the 
law and beyond, we will be able to 
contrast this administration . 

It shouldn't be hard. Bush is a 
former boozehound, probably a 
former cocaine user and his closet 
contains more skeletons than the 
entire UCSD School of Medicine. 
With hard work and a bit of luck, 
we can have him impeached 
before Christmas.

8 NEWS The UCSD Guardian Monday, January 22,2001 

ORLD & NATION 
Bush Settles Into a Redecorated White 
House on Inauguration Day 

WASHINGTON - In his first 
full day in the White House, 
President Bush on Sunday gave a 
tour of his new home to support-
ers, prepared to announce a trip to 
Mexico, and senled into an Oval 
Office that in less than 24 hours 
had been redecorated to remove 
virtually all traces of its previous 
occupant. 

After an exhausting Saturday 
night of inaugural ball-hopping, 
Bush woke early, had coffee with 
his parmts and spent most of the 
day getting accustomed to his new 
surroundings. 

At moments, the 132-room 
mansion appeared somewhat 
unfamiliar to him despite his 
f,Hher's four-year residency there: 
The ne'" presIdent listt:l1ed care-
fully as a White House guide took 
him and supporters on a tour of 
the public rooms. Later he greeted 
some of the 2,200 people who 
were succrs ful in obtaining tick-
ets to the traditional first-day 
open hOllse. 

"I slept pretty well," Bush said, 
telling reporters that he planned 
to take it easy Sunday. 

Behind the scenes - and amid 
falling plaster, fresh paint and a 
mdSS of computer cables - his 
top aides were planning their 
strategy for a week devoted to 
fleshing out his education pro-

posals and taking the first legisla-
tive crack at his promise of a $1.6 
trillion tax cut. 

His chief of staff, Andrew Card, 
said that Bush was considering a 
trip to Mexico sometime in the next 
two months, to visit the foreign 
leader he knows best, the COllntry'S 
new president, Vicente Fox. 

Bush's aides have made it clear 
that they intend to get the new 
president off to an active start, 
even if h is first week is filled more 
with symbolism than legislative 
substance. 

Within two hours of his oath-
taking on Saturday, he ordered a 
halt on the publication of new 

Chuck Kennedy/ Knight-Ridder Tribune 
regulations in the Federal Register 
until they could be reviewed, and 
issued instructions to slow the 
implementation of already pub-
lished executive orders and regu-
lations that flooded out the White 
House in former President 
Clinton's last days. 

In the White House, even the 
appearance of the West Wing is 
changing. Gone from the Oval 
Office is the dark-blue carpet that 
dominated the room, replaced by 
an off-white oval rug with touch-
es of melon and sage.

Planetarium Demotes Baby Planet Pluto 
NEW YORK - As she walked 

past a display of photos of planets 
at the Rose Center for Earth and 
Space, Pamela Curtice of Atlanta 
scrunched her brow, perplexed. 
There didn't seem to be enough 
planets. 

She started counting on her fin-
gers, trying to remember the 
mnemonic her son had learned in 
school: 

My Very Educated Mother Just 
Served Us Nine Pizzas. 

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. 

"I had to go through the whole 
thing to figure out which one was 
missing," she said. 

Pluto. 
Pluto was not there. 
Quietly, and apparently unique-

ly among major institutions, the 
American Museum of atural 
History cast Pluto from the pan-
theon of planets when it opened 
the Rose Center last February. 
Nowhere does the center describe 
Pluto as a planet, but nowhere does 
it declare that Pluto is NOT a plan-
et. 

"We're not that confrontation-

War: 
Paramilitaries have been 
selective about killings 
Continued from ..... 1 
unarmed villagers accused of pro-
viding rebels wi th supplies. But in 
the last few weeks, the Un ited Self-
Defense Forces of Colombia have 
retooled for urban warfare in this 
city of 300,000, abruptly changing 
strategies in the new environment, 
say human rights workers and the 
combatants themselves. 

Instead of mass killings, the 
paramilitaries have, for the most 
part, been selectively killing rebels. 
Instead of terrorizing residents, the 

al," said Dr. Neil de Grasse Tyson, 
the planetarium director. 

Still, the move is surprising, 
because the museum appears to 
have unilaterally demoted Pluto, 
reassigning it as one of more than 
300 icy bodies orbiting beyond 
Neptune, in a region called the 
Kuiper Belt. 

Nowhere does the center 
describe Pluto as a 
planet, but nowhere does 
it declare that Pluto is 
not a planet. 

"They went too far in demoting 
Pluto, way beyond what the main-
stream astronomers think: said Dr. 
Richard P. Binzel, a planetary sci-
ence professor at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 

Dr. S. Alan Stern, director of 
Southwest Research Institute's 
space studies department in 
Boulder, Colo., agreed: "'They are a 
minority viewpoint. It's absurd. The 
astronomical community has set-
tled this issue." 

paramilitaries are paying hand-
somely to rent houses in battle-
ground neighborhoods, as well as 
for supplies and information that 
can be used against the rebels. 

And in contrast to warfare in 
the co untryside, human rights 
groups say, the militia members are 
killing fewer people than the rebels, 
who have responded to the threat 
in neighborhoods they long con-
trolled with a furious assault on 
those-they accuse of supporting the 
paramilitaries. 

"In a rural zone, it's very differ-
ent," said a commander who goes 
by the name Lexor. "In a rural 
zone, you can shoot where you 
want, and there's no problem . 
Here, you can't because there's a 

Indeed, the International 
Astronomical Union, the profes-
sional society of astronomers, still 
calls Pluto a planet. Even a propos-
al in 1999 to list Pluto as both a 
planet and a member of the Kuiper 
Belt dtew fierce protest from people 
who felt that the additional "minor 
planet" designation would dimin-
ish Pluto's stature. 

But even some astronomers 
defending Pluto admit that were it 
discovered today, it might not be 
awarded planethood because it is 
so small - only about t ,400 miles 
wide - and so different from the 
other planets. 

But the Denver Museum of 
Nature and Science, which is build-
ing a $45 million space science 
center, will also still count nine 
planets. "We're sticking with Pluto," 
said Dr. Laura Danly, the curator. 

But, she also said: "I think there

civilian population in the middle, 
and our war is direct. Very direct." 

That is not to say it is not bru-
tal. Already, 38 ki ll ings have been 
registered since Jan. t, a pace that 
would give Barrancabermeja 637 
homicides for the year. That 
would top the 567 last year, a ~te 
nearly 20 times that of New York 
City. 

Barrancabermeja (pronounced 
Bah-RAHN-kah-ber-MAY-huh) is 
the most violent city in Colombia. 
The country has been racked for 36 
years by a conflict that pits two 
rebel armies against the govern-
ment and the outlawed paramili-
taries, which draw resources from 
large landowners and narco-traf-
ficking. 

POW8r: 
The new plants are not 
an immediate solution 
ContI ...... "... ..... 1 
day shifts to build a huge power-
generating plant in the nation's 
largest state, which has not built a 
major energy plant in over a decade. 

Several such mammoth con-
struction projects are under way in 
California, and energy analysts say 
they are an essential key to easing 
the deepening electricity crisis that 
has led to rolling blackouts in 
recent days, threatening the liveli-
hood of businesses ranging from 
Internet companies in Silicon Valley 
to farms in the inland va ll eys. 

Even though the projects repre-
sent a total of 6,723 megawatts -
enough electricity to power nearly 
7 million homes, they do not by 
themselves guarantee an adequate 
supply for California, since roughly 
half of the existing power plants are 
more than 30 years old and in dan-
ger of being retired, according to 
the California Energy Commission, 
a state agency. 

In the short term, many inde-
pendent experts say that the only 
way the state can avoid supply 

problems is to expand conservation 
measures, especially those that sig-
nificantly bring down the peak 
demand level. One way to do that is 
to make the power more expensive 
at times of the day when demand is 
greatest, giving businesses and 
consumers an inc.entive to change 
their electricity use. 

No major power plants were 
built in California in the t 990s, 
when the state's population grew 
by 4 million, and a soaring econo-
my, led by the boom in high tech-
nology, also sparked demand for 
electricity. Since deregulation 
passed, California has approved the 
nine plants now un<ler construc-
tion, and 22 more are now in the 
regulatory pipeline. 

But the new plants do not rep-
resent any immediate solution to 
California's electricity shortages. 
Two big utilities, Pacific Gas and 
Electric and Southern California 
Edison, are on the verge of bank-
ruptcy, they say, because they had 
to buy electricity on the open 
wholesale market as prices rose, 
but under California's deregulation 
law they could not pass costs on to 
the consumer.

Many Filipinos Welcome 
Change in Leadership 

MANILA, Philippines 
President Joseph Estrada's depar-
ture from office this past weekend 
and the swearing- in of Vice 
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo 
to replace him brought a peaceful 
end to the Philippines' worst polit-
ical crisis since the strongman 
Ferdinand Marcos was driven from 
office in t 986. 

Estrada, who was accused of 
widespread corruption , stepped 
down on Saturday, after top aides 
and military officials withdrew their 
support for him, and tens of thou-
sands of protesters took to the 
streets in what is being viewed as a 
resurgence of the "people power" 
revolution that ousted Marcos. 

At church services, shopping 
malls, restaurants and street stalls 
across Manila, the mood on 
Sunday was upbeat and the talk 
centered on the pivotal role that 
huge public demonstrations played 
in Estrada's exit. 

Speaking at a downtown Mass 
anended by several thousand peo-
ple, Arroyo praised the country's 
young people, who made up the 
vast majority of the demonstrators. 

At the same Mass, the Roman 
Catholic cardinal Jaime Sin, the 
nation's spiritual leader, said the 
country was like a newborn child 

Now, the city is being fought 
over because the government is 
considering, as a basis for peace 
talks, allowing the National 
Liberation Army to control a 
2,OOO-square-mile zone in the jun-
gles and cattle ranches across the 
Magdalena River in Bolivar 
province. 

The paramilitaries, who in the 
last two years pushed their way into 
the region, oppose such a move. 
They say they are simply protecting 
the region from becoming what the 
southern Caqueta Province 
became when the government cre-
ated a similar zone two years ago 
for the larger rebel group: a safe 
haven for rebels to hide kidnapping 
victims, initiate anacks and culti-

and admonished Filipinos to 
remain vigilant. "We must never 
allow the mistakes of the past to 
best us again: he said. 

But Estrada ~eft office without 
being prosecuted, despite com-
pelling ~vidence against him, which 
was suppressed at his Senate 
impeachment trial. And that was 
proof for many here that t 5 years 
after. the end of the nQtorious graft-
filled Marcos years, the Philippines 
was still far from conquering cor-
ruption, and real · democracy 
remained elusive. 

"This will be a very hollow vic-
tory if Estrada, his cronies, and the 
senators who tried to cover up his 
crimes are allowed to walk away 
free: said Bill Luz, executive direc-
tor of the Makati Business Club, an 
organization of the country's 
largest corporations. 

Aquilino Pimentel, the former 
president of the Senate, said that 
bribes, payoffs, kickbacks and 
nepotism were endemic across all 
sectors of the Philippines and that 
cracking down on corruption and 
strengthening the economy should 
be the top priori ties of the new 
administration. 

vate coca. 

- Calvin Sims 
The New York Times 

Government -officials, villagers 
and experts on the conflict con-
tend, though, that the paramili-
taries here are getting revenues 
from the regional production of 
coca - the raw material used to 
make cocaine - and they do not 
want to lose it. 

Human rights organizations, 
including Human Rights Watch, 
based in the United States, and 
church workers say the military has 
passively allowed paramilitary gun-
men to wage war here. The military 
says it is vigorously pursuing para-
militaries as well as rebels.

Energy:

ContI ...... froIn ..... 1 
buildings have emergency genera-

Hospitals have also undergone 
measures in order to safeguard 
against possible roll ing blackouts. 

Director of Facilities Dennis 
Goodrich said the hospitals have 
back up emergency generators 
that ensure all life saving equip-

"Due to the automatic nature 
of the emergency generators, all 
life saving equipment never sens-

EX U 

Student Trustees 
embody the philanthropic 

spi rit of UCSD 

L ooking around, some would argue that stu-dents at UCSD are gen-erally apathetic and a bit 
disdainful of their under-

graduate experiences. After all , we 
are not a Division I school. We don't 
even have a football team. 

But look a bit deeper, and you will 
find that student involvement is 
making UCSD one of the top-ranked 
schools in California and in the 
nation. In fact , as a public institution, 
we place seventh in U.S. News and 
World Report'S 2001 college ranking. 
UCSD is also the third-ranked col-
lege in the UC system and, at 31st, 
one of the youngest colleges to make 
the top 50 in the nation. 

As a research institution, UCSD 
is even more impressive. We recent-
ly took one of three major $300 mil-
lion state grants from UC Berkeley, 
which is perhaps a telltale sign of 
more to come. 

These statistics are made possible 
ill part by the involvement of stu-
dents, like the members of the UCSD 
Student Foundation, the donors that 
support this group and the inspira-
tion of people like Vice Chancellor 
James Langley, who initially came up 
with the idea for the group. 
CoIIceptIon 

The UCSD Student Foundation 
is an idea carried over from Georgia 
Tech by Langley, who, as vice chan-
cellor, is in charge of external rela-
tions. It is the first in the UC system 
and stems from the philosophy that 
when given the opportunity to 
become involved and invested in the 
bettennent of their own education, 
students will rise to the occasion. 

The idea took off in early 1999 
when UCSD graduates Marc and 
Patricia Brutten agreed to donate 
$100,000 to start the foundation . 
The Bruttens have a history of 
donating money to UCSD, specifi-
cally to the Alumni Association 
Scholarship Fund, an~ saw this as a 
chance to encourage student partic-
ipation and to enable students to 
make a difference for themselves. 

The money established a means 
of "reaching out to aspiring students 
with business acumen and offering 
them a way to connect to the 
University," according to the 
Foundation's Web site, located at 
http/lwww.studentfoundatilJTl.ucsd.cdu. 

The main goal of the UCSD 
Student Foundation is to build a 
strong student community that 
understands the role of philan-
thropic acts in a society Written 
directly into its bylaws is th :5 state-
ment: "The purpose of the UCSDSF 
is to promote, facilitate and perpetu-
ate the philanthropic spirit among 
the UCSD student community." 

Langley has described the 
Student Foundation as an opportu-
nity for friends and supporters of 
the university to interact with stu-
dents, a mechanism for the student 
body to support fundraising efforts 
and a way for students to give to 
each other by way of scholarships. 

It isn't that difficult for one stu-
dent to make a difference. according 
to Carolyn Muhlstein, a graduate 
student at the School ofInternational 
Relations and Pacific Studies, and 
member of the Student Foundation. 

"The founders of the UCSD 
Student Foundation understood 

that when individuals begin donat-
ing money to philanthropic organi-
zations at a young age, this habit 
stays with them later in life," 
Muhlstein said. "The founders also 
understood that it is important for 
all members of society 
to make contributions 
of any size to philan-
thropy, regardless of per-
sonal wealth. As students, 
most of us are financially 
strapped, but by giving a little, 
and seeing how our resources 
can be pooled to make a difference, 
we gain a very real understanding of 
our ability to positively influence the 
lives of those less fortunate." 

According to Ping Yeh, an engi-
neering graduate student and the 
current president of ' the Student 
Foundation, the "philanthropic spir-
it of UCSD" means an awareness of 

• how lucky we all are. 
"We have more than an opportu-

nity to get an education at UCSD," 
Yeh said. "Once we realize we have 
such gifts in life, we have seemingly 
a moral obligation to take action to 
improve our university, our commu-
nities and our earth. Making daily 
efforts to strengthen our relation-
ships with others, with UCSD and 
ourselves, will bring us all closer to 
the way of life that brings respect 
and Caring for each other and our 
environment. "

TheEditor'sSoa pbox 
By AUSON NORRIS 

Political Zipper Problem 
Proves far Better than the 
Alternative 

Managing Editor 

I would like to propose a mild 
brain teaser for all the semi-
awake, loyal readers out there 
who are waiting with baited 
breath to flip to the personals sec-
tion of this newspaper. Our 
nation , which has tried time and 
time again to legislate human 
morality, is amoral. Believe it: Sex, 
drugs and violence are still "the 
American Way." . 

The Reverend Jesse Jackson -
Rainbow Coalition posterboy and 
spiritual advisor to former 
President Clinton - has a 20-
month-old illegitimate child, and 
meanwhile, Texas' electric chair is 
regularly being filled with flesh to 
deep-fry unpopular members of 
our own species. 

Floridians still think their 
votes were fairly counted, and we 
all still have a 50-50 chance of 
divorcing. Forget the fact that I'm 
not bemg inaugurated into any-
thing; this is my inaugural 
address. 

The rampant zipper problem 
plaguing public officeholders of 
the male genre has many 
America ns embittered . Those 
who know me will also know that 
I too have been a sucker for a man 
in power, and thus I offer the fol-
lowing advice to the Monicas of 
this nation: Run to the media, 
ladies - we will embrace your 
stories of size and style whether 

Trustees: 
The group is now in the 
second stage of the process 
ContInued from ..... 11 
fund of over $200 million. Trustees 
have designed a formal mentoring 
program to help the members of 
the student foundation manage 
their endowment and work more 
efficiently. It is important for the 
Student Foundation to be pat-
terned after the foundation in order 
for the trustees to better advise the 
student trustees. 

"If the organization is commit-
ted to the same guiding principles 
and has the same structure, it's 
easier to provide counsel and to 

you've been sleeping with con-
gressmen, reverends or first 
ladies. By spilling it all, you .may 
gain a little of the power that was 
handed to those men just because 
they were born with penises. My 
advice comes with one reserva-
tion, however - just don't go to 
Larry Flynt. 

As for the death penalty, I 
point to the Environmental 
Protection Agency's Endangered 
Species Protection Program, 
which obliges the government to 
protect species from pesticides. 
The poison-filled needles that 
our government has so subtly 
an d endearingly nicknamed 
"lethal injections" certainly qual-
ify as pesticides meant for the 
pestlike members of the human 
species. Any analytical thinker 
can see that through the electric 
chair, we're letting the D.C. boys 
break the very laws they've made 
rega rding preservation of 
species. 

Not to mention the fact that, 
somehow, women and whites are 
mysteriously avoiding death row 
in comparison to the number of 
black men , who are the favorite 
contestants for execution, that are 
on death row. I support affirmative 
action - does that mean I'm a 
proponent of opening up a few 
spots for the women and white 
men who keep getting excluded 
from death row while African 
American men occupy all the 
slots? ot exactly. I'm not arguing 

serve as a model for students to 
observe: Langley said. "Also, we 
hope that the student trustees 
become involved alumni and ulti-
mately aspire to a place on the UC 
San Diego .Foundation." . 

The students also appreciate 
the knowledge that the members 
of the original Foundation provide. 

"As with the creation of any 
new organization, our learning 
curve is incredibly steep: 
Muhlstein said. "Since members 
of the original foundation have 
been through many of the same 
challenges we are experiencing, 
their expertise is invaluable." 

Currently there are 12 Student 
Trustees, including several gradu-
ate students and one student 
studying abroad. The full board is

for a diversification of death row; 
I'm arguin$ for an elimination of 
the whole Idea in general. I don't 
care if people want to strap each 
other down with leather belts as 
long as it isn't about death. 

[f all that doesn't convince 
you, consider this: Government-
endorsed and government-
enforced murder doesn't seem 
like a good idea when we've got 
people like Dubya calling the 
shots. Wouldn't you be a bit 
miffed if that moron, who recent-
ly told Barbara Walters that he is 
unsure if Russia is a friend or a 
threat, ordained your execution? 
[ guess the cocaine and booze 
must have caused him to miss 
more of the '80s than we origi-
nally thought - the guy still 
doesn't realize that the Cold War 
ended. 

Another problem plaguing 
"the union" is sketchy voting pro-
cedures. The fact that Florida is 
filled with nothing but prune 
juice consumers and people who 
earn their income by parading 
around Fantasy Land as mice, 
chipmunks and princesses should 
have caught our attention a long 
time ago. No wonder the butterfly 
ballot confused them - they

Place on Earth" or they haven 't 
had contact with anyone but the

interviewing and recommending 
potential trustees to the Board of 
Trustees for final approval. 

According to Yeh, the group is 
in the second stage of a four-stage 
process that began at its 1999 
conception. 

During the first year, Student 
Trustees focused on building the 
infrastructure of the group, includ-

. ing creating a mission statement, 
establishing bylaws and a Web site. 
. [n the second stage, student 

trustees are beginning to focus on 
outreach programs to involve staff, 
faculty, alumni, the community and 
especially students in the improve-
ment of UCSD. Yeh feels that the 
Student Foundation has an advan-
tageous position in this particular 
stage because the members, as stu-
dents, know better than staff and 
administration what works and 
what doesn't work with students. 

The third stage is to work with 
the students to generate dona-
tions for important causes around 
campus. Here students will have 
the opportunity to donate both 
time and money to a cause of their 
choosing. Yeh hopes that the 
foundation will serve as a facilita-
tor for philanthropic service 
among UCSD students. 

The fourth stage is to help to 
change the rhetoric surrounding 
UCSD student apathy. The hope is 
that students, upon discovering 
their own power to instill change in 
this community, will carry that phi-
losophy throughout their lives and 
continue to give in their lives to 
their communities and to UCSD. 

"[ think the students of UCSD 
should be proud that we have the 
only student foundation in the 

UC system: said Yeh . "We have 
an organization that is a teacher 
and facilitator for our own peers. 
That feels great to all of us." 
eurr.t Projects 

Although only in its second 
year, the Student Foundation is 
already working to initiate change 
in the UCSD community. The 
group is currently focusing its 
energy on two projects. The first , 
titled "Change for Change: is 
designed to help the Preuss School 
students, and the second will ben-
efit UCSD students directly. 

"Change for Change" pits the 
five colleges against one other in 
an effort to see which one can 
raise the most money by throwing 
extra change into bins located 
around campus. Each college is in 
charge of the strategic location of 
its own bin. 

Although the Preuss School 
was recently completed, the con-
struction fund s fell short of 
including items such as lunch 
tables, jungle gyms and other 
standard middle school equip-
ment. Money from "Change for 
Change" will be used to purchase 
lunch tables for the students, who 
currently sit on the ground and on 
grassy areas during lunch time. 
The tables will also be used for 
tutoring, a service that some 
UCSD students currently provide. 

This competition is being 
sponsored by the UCSD Alumni 
Association. The Association has 
agreed to match donations up to 
$2,000 in an effort to improve the 
Preuss School. The tables will be 
in scripted with plaques reading. 
"From current college scholars to 
future co llege scholars." 

The competition goes until 
Feb. 2, and the money will be 
counted at Spirit Night. The col-
lege that wins the competition will 
earn a free movie night at the Price 
Center Theater, with the discretion 
to pick the movie and night. 

FEATURES 13 

UCSDSF's second project is in 
conjunction with the University 
Center Advisory Board to develop a 
"Wall of Student Excellence and 
Philanthropy· for the Price Center. 
The UCSDSF is working with 
Sony to have a flat-screen television 
donated, which, if garnered, will be 
hung alongside several awards in 
the A.S. offices. The television will 
be used to advertise UCSD activi-
ties and projects and to highlight 
the efforts of UCSD students. The 
wall will also highlight UCSDSF 
scholarship recipients. 

[n addition to raisi ng money 
for UCSD projects, the Student 
Foundation has also made finan -
cial contributions to UCSD. The 
most generous would be its $3,000 
contribution to the Chancellor's 
5K, a run designed to raise money 
for scholarships. The money 
donated to the fund is matched by 
the Chancellor, resulting in six 
$1,000 scholarships for incoming 
UCSD students. 

The Student Foundation also 
donated 1,000 bottles of water to 
the UCSD Un-Olympics during 
the first week of fall quancr. as an 
effort to reach out to incoming 
students. 
Getting Involved 

Currently students can help by 
contributing to their colleges' bins 
to support the Preuss School. In 
the future. students will be able to 
go online to donate to a specific 
cause or to the general pool of 
investment principal th at only 
goes towards scholarships. 

Applica tions to become a stu-
dent trustee can be found online. 
UCSD undergraduate or graduate 
students of any major who are in 
good academic standing may 
apply. 

"Applicants should have experi-
ence In and/or be motivated to 
learn about philanthropy, fund 
raising and investment manage-
ment: states the Web site.

Soapbox: 
'Temptation Island' 
represents American ideals 
Continued from ..... 12 
removed from the rest of the coun-
try. 

Pahaps equally frightening is 
the trouble I encountered upon 
trying to vote in Del Mar. Instead of 
being handed a ballot and a ballot-
punching machine in which to 
insert my ballot, I was given a bal-
lot-punching machine that already 
had a ballot inserted into it. Excited 
about voting and late for class, I 
didn 't give the situati on much 
thought, nor did I check the ballot 
before I began punching away for 
the leftists. 

What I realized once CNN 
began attacking the Florida situa-
tion was that the Gucci-c1ad, tan-
ning booth-veteran poll worker 
who grimaced upon seeing my 
UCS 0 sweatshirt easily could 
have punched a few holes through 
my ballot before sticking it into 
the machine and handing the con-
traption to me - which would 
have immediately disqualified my 
ballot. It seems like I'd fit in in 
FlOrida mqre than I would like to 
think . 

The true indicator of our 
nallon 's status, however, is the pop-
ularIty of Fox's "Temptation 
Island." We already know that we 
only have a SO-SO chance of estab-
lishing a lifelong marriage. 

We also know that about 40 
percent of people cheat on their 
significant other. Yct FOX seems to 

think we might not comprehend 
these facts even after all those 
"Jerry Springer" reruns we 've 
watched, so the network has 
decidt:d to use "Temptation 
Island" to reiterate that sometimes 
love really isn 't enough, and 
humans probably are just lustful 
fiends like every other animal on 
this planet. 

BOllObo female chimpanzees, 
which constitute our closest rela-
tives by sharing 98 percent of our 
genetic material, are known to 
detach male chimps' penises and 
scrotums if the mood is right. I 
swear I saw the same thing going 
on between a human couple on a 
1 a.m. "Jerry Springer" episode 
last week, and I would do the 
same thing if my boyfriend fell 
victim to a "Temptation Island" 
cutie. 

"Temptation Island" also proves 
that Americans' voyeuristic ten-
dencies can no longer be denied -
more couch potatoes watched the 
opening episode of "Temptation 
Island" than any other FOX series 
in history ... but to see what? Stable 
relationships crumbling away as 
primal attraction triumphs over 
emotional commitment, and men 
and women admitting to them-
selves that love will not necessarily 
find a way is apparently now enter-
tainment. 

Meanwhile, here co mes 
President Bush to fo rce Christian 
concepts of fa mily down our 
throats (i.e. male-female lifelong 
marriages). I think I prefer Clinton 
and Jackson with their zipper prob-
lems - at least their lifestyles 
reflect pop culture.

Horoscopes: 
See what your birthday 
has in store for you 
ContInued froID ..... 12 
likely to find the perfect thing. 

Scorpio (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
It's back 10 the books for you 

on Monday and Tuesday, to fix an 
annoying problem at home. You 
may be pleased with your success 
on Wednesday, but don't gloat. It's 
100 likely you'll find more trouble 
on Thursday. Ignore a minor dis-
agreement with your mate on 
Friday. Love triumphs quite nicely 
that day, much to your mutual 
delight. Be careful on Saturday to 
not break something expensive. 
Make playing with your sweet-
heart the top priority for Sunday. 

-..m-t •• (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Help out a friend and earn a 

bonus on Monday and Tuesday. 
Study up on Wednesday for the test 
that's coming Thursday. And, don't 
believe everything you hear on 
Friday. Do your own investigation 
and get more of what you want. 
You've got a mess on your hands 
Saturday. Don't avoid it,just do the 
best you can, and you'll have a 
snuggly nest to relax in by Sunday. 

c.priconI (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
A friend thinks you can do it 

on Monday and Tuesday, so let 
yourself be convinced. The money 
looks too easy on Wednesday, and 
the problems start showing up on 
Thursday and Friday. You're kept 

hopping, but you're up to the 
challenge. Don't bother to run 
errands on Saturday. Save them 
for Sunday, and you're more apt 
to tind what you're seeking. 

Aq ..... (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 
Gather up the resources and 

information you still need on 
Monday and Tuesday. By 
Wednesday you should be almost 
ready to launch. There will be 
delays, you can count on that. It 
could be late Thursday or Friday 
before you actually get going. This 
is as it should be, so don't push. 
You might break something. You 
might also get disappointing news 
late Friday or early Saturday. An 
older person is making more 
demands, but that's also OK. You'll 
have a better result when you're 
finally done. Use some of that 
bounty you've recently acquired to 
fix up your place on Sunday. 

Plsc .. (Feb. 19-March 20) 
A close friend and a distant one 

both have good advice on Monday 
and Tuesday. Listen to them. Don't 
completely ignore your inner voic-
es, just don't be intimidated by 
them. .And, don 't believe 
Wednesday's job will be as easy as it 
looks, either. It gets complicated on 
Thursday and Friday. Plan carefully 
and be prepared for just about any-
thing. Complying with an older 
person's whims is a whole new 
challenge Saturday, but the tide's in 
your favor. By this weekend, you 
can be resting in the lap of luxury. 

IIrt.....,. TIll. Week 
Jan . 22: The pressure 's on, but 

Monday, January 22, 2001 

it's your own decision. Push hard 
to make a fantasy come true. 

Jan. 23: You've got the talent, 
that's obvious. Now, prove you've 
also got the common sense. 
Follow an older person's advice. 

Jan . 24: You're creative, confi-
dent and powerful this year! Be 
compassionate, too, and you'll 
take home all the prizes. 

Jan. 25: You're facing a few 
tough puzzles, but don't even 
worry. If you didn 't have a chal-
lenge or two, you'd get bored! 

Jan 26: You can win the 
respect you destr"e and the 
money to go with It. Don't let a 
setback stop you; come back with 
the facts. 

Jan. 27: Shrewd planning and 
extensive research are required. 
Don't take anything for granted, 
and success can be yours. 

Jan. 28: You're blessed with a 
combination of mental and emo-
tional energy. You'll be both ana-
lytical and compassionate if you're 
wise.

Basketball Loses Two More Football: No recent talk of 
reviving the team 

third- and fourth-stringers from 
Cal Lu. 

"I iUess they thought we would 
be bringing out a bunch of ringers, 
so we ended up playing their first 
string the first half," he said. "The 
second half wasn't nearly as bad [as 
the first)" 

Close loss to Dominguez Hills has been the tone of the season 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team once again had its mettle 
tested last weekend in two key 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association matches. 

Both tilts were held at RlMAC 
Arena. vs. California State 
University Los Angeles on Friday 
night and CSU Dominguez Hills 
on Saturday evening. The 
Tritons, despite inspired play and 
some solid individual perfor-
mances, were vanquished in both 
contests. 

The CSU Los Angeles game 
was a back-and-forth affair early 
on, with the score a close 3'2-28 
as the first half came to a close. 
CSU Los Angeles parlayed that 
fo ur-point lead into 10 points, 
however, in the second half, to 
pick up the victory with a final 
score of 71-61 . 

The Eagles won by virtue of a 
balanced attack, with four players 
scoring in double figures. They 
were led by forward Ronald 
Johnson. who shot 7 for 14 from 
the floor en route to compiling a 
team-high 17 points. 

His supporting cast included 
guard Quincy Stinson, who had 
16 points. on 4-7 shooting, while 
going six of seven from the chari-
ty stripe and chalking up four 
assists. 

Teammate Ricky Maiden also 
rang up 16 points, whi le Jonathan 
Levy had 15 of his own in the vic-
tory. 

The Tritons were led by for-
ward Cole Miller, who had a 
game-high 18 points and dished 
out five assists. Senior guard Nick 
Christenson was also a major 

contributor for UCSD, notching 
15 points on six-for-eight shoot-
ing and pulling down four 
rebounds. Also chipping in with a 
double-figure tally was Erik 
Ramp, who had 11 points on the 
night. 

Alas, it was not to be, as the 
Eagles' four-pronged attack could 
not be contained and the victori-
ous Cal State Los Angeles squad 
improved its record to 5-4 in 
CCAA play and evened up at 7-7 

Alas, it was not to be, 
as the Eagles' four-
pronged attack could 
not be contained and 
the victorious Cal State 
Los Angeles squad 
improved its record to 
5-4 in CCAA play and 
evened up at 7-7 
overall. 
overall. 

If Friday's game was disheart-
ening for the Triton players, the 
match held the following night vs. 
Cal State Dominguez Hills was 
probably more akin to having that 
vital organ ripped from their bod-
ies and then repeatedly stomped 
upon. 

In a horrifically close contest, 
the Tritons were nudged out 56-
54. 

The two teams were-neckr 
and neck throughout the match, 
with the score knotted at 25-25 
when the whistle sounded sig-
naling the end of the first half. 

Dominguez Hills, though, had 
the final two-point lead at the 
end, and the team took home the 
victory in front of a crowd of 
790. 

It was led by forward Reggie 
Williams, who had 23 points on 
nine of 16 shooting to go along 
with his nine rebounds. Guard 

. Geoffrey Meeks also chipped in 
with 12 points for the 
Dominguez squad, who upped 
it's record to 3-7 in conference 
play. 

The Tritons, in defeat, were 
once again carried by Miller, who 
led all players with 27 points, 
including a whopping eight 
three-pointers. 

He was not only on fire from 
downtown, but also under the 
boards, pulling down an impres-
sive nine rebounds. 

Sam Higgins also kicked in 
three three-pointers and seven 
rebounds for the Tritons. These 
individual efforts just weren't 
enough , especially with the rest of 
the starting five combining for a 
mere seven points. 

With the weekend's two in-
league losses, UCSD's record fell 
t,o 1-9 in CCAA play and 2-13 
overall. While their record may 
not reflect it, the Tritons are 
making progress on the hard-
wood. 

With a more consistent team 
effort and a couple of bounces 
here and there, the Tritons would 
have picked up the victory yersus 
Dominguez and been right in the 
thick of things at the end of Cal 
State Los Angeles match. Let's 
hope their luck improves, as this 
Wednesday they head out to 
Arizona to do battle with Grand 
Canyon University.

here pretty much died when the 
athletic department realized that 
Division III didn't make any more 
sense: Gannon said. "No [Division 
Il] schools but Davis has a team ... 
and no Division III schools would 
play us anymore. " 

That didn't stop some UCSD 
students in 1997 from starting a 
football club team on their own. 

The UCSD football club team 
was organized by students who 
simply wanted to play. The 
founders of the team manned 
tables in the Price Center and in 
front of Center Hall to recruit stu-
dents to be on the team. 

According to early football club 
member Richard Downing, who 
graduated from Roosevelt College 
in 1998, their recruitment and 
organizational efforts met with 
some success and some hardship 
in the beginning. 

"Overall we had a lot of support 
from the student body and even 
some of the administration," 
Downing said. "But at times it 
could get pretty frustrating when 
we'd hear students laughing, or 
when people would come up to the 
table and ask 'Is this a joke?'" 

The team received little funding 
from the school, and the players 
had to pay for almost all the 
expenses. 

The club ended up playing two 
games - one in 1997 and one in 
1998, both against Cal Lutheran 
University. 

The 1997 game featured a 
Triton squad 35-strong and ended 
with UCSD losing 0-66. 

According to former club team 
member Brian Halderson, who 
graduated from Warren College in 
1999, they came expecting to play 

The second game also ended 
with a Triton shutout, but the mar-
gin was not nearly as wide, with Cal 
Lu coming out on top 35-0. 

After its original organizers 
graduated, the UCSD football club 
did not return in 1999, and there 
has been no UCSD full-contact 
football team since. 

The future of football at UCSD 
is unclear, at best. 

Since the move to Division II, the 
lack of football programs at this level 
make it very difficult to find teams to 
play without gening on an airplane 
for most of the away games. 

"There are far more teams 
dropping football than adding," 
said Regina Sullivan, associate ath-
letics director at UCSD. 

Also, federal Title IX regulations 
mandate that athletic participation 
be representative of the student 
population in terms of the propor-
tion of men to women. 

According to Sullivan, that 
would entail adding three women's 
sports, which would make the 
financial burden even higher. 

It seems the only way football 
could come back to UCSD in ' the 
near future would be in the form of 
another club team, which has its 
own drawbacks, mainly bein~ the 
high costs of equipment and liabil-
ity insurance. 

"The money can be raised," 
Halderson said. "The equipment can 
be bought. The fields are there. If 
like 60 students who wanted to play 
just got together and said, 'We want 
to play football: it would happen." 

Downing believes it's just a 
question of motivation: "Do the 
people who want it want it bad 
enough?"

hero. Those scientists fighting 
AIDS are heroic. Santa Claus is 
heroic. Harriet Thbman was heroic. 
The list goes on and on. 

Heroes are those who help 
mankind, save mankind and try to 
better mankind. They are not foot-
ball players who run for a lot of 
yards or basketball players who 
lead their teams to victory. They 
may look good, but not heroic. 

That is not to say that there are 
not athletes out there who are 
heroes. There are plenty of heroic 
athletes, and their heroism spreads 
beyond the field or court. 

The one that sticks out the 
most is Jackie Robinson. He went 
through so much shit in breaking 
the color barrier that few of ' us 
can understand. He is a hero not 
only to African Americans but to 
anyone who has experienced prej-
udice. 

Sean Elliot of the San Antonio 
Spurs is another athlete hero. He 
had a kidney transplant and still 

- came back to play in the NBA. 
Before, if there was something 
wrong with your kidney, you were 
best off calling your lawyer to work 
on your will . Elliot proved that 

Football: 
UCSD's program got 
off on the wrong foot 
CoIItII ...... from ..... 20 ' 

And it came to pass in those 
days, that there went out a decree 
from head coach Walt Hacken that 
any with a brave enough heart 
come out and join the newly 
instated Triton football team. 

The team was fonned, and it 
played its first game against the 
University of La Verne. The mighty 
Tritons fell 41 -6. Next came the 
perennial division powerhouse, Cal 
Lutheran University. The mighty 
mtons fell 56-8. These scores pret-
ty well characterize the mighty 
Tritons' entire 0-7 inaugural season. 

The real humiliation though 
was UCSD's game against Cal 
Tech. At that time, the Cal Tech 
football team was the bottom of 
the barrel. It was so bad, it literally 
hadn't won a game in years. 
Though it was close (the only close 
game of the season for UCSD), the 
diminutive Tritons fell 34-31. 
Rumor has it there were parties at 
Cal Tech for years 'after on the 
anniversary of the win. 

Apparently the humiliation was 
just too much, and UCSD football 
was scrapped at the end of the '68-
'69 academic year. 

There was an effort to bring the 
team back for the fall 1971 season, 
but it has met with lackluster sup-
port, and the effort fizzled. That 
was pretty much it for Triton foot-
ball until the late '80s, when there 
again was a push to bring the grid-
iron back to UCSD. 

According to Bill Gannon, 
sports information director at 
UCSD, the A.S. Council put three 
referendums on the ballot. There 
was one each in 1987, 1989 and 

. 1994, all of which provided for a 
small increase in student fees to 
fund a football team. 

He said that all of the referenda 
were officially supported by the 
athletic department and each gar-
nered about 60 percent of the vote. 
None of them, however, passed. 
This is because two of the referen-
dums needed a two-thirds vote, 
and the other required that 20 per-
cent of the undergraduate popula-
tion vote in order to fonn a quo-
rum, which it did not. 

After that, the focus of the ath-
letic department moved from foot-
ball to the transition to Division II. 

"The idea of a football program

now, even though you may be 
down, you are never out. 

Magic Johnson is another such 
athlete, much like in the IiIliot 
theme. He came back with HIV to 
play some more in the NBA. He 
now tours and raises money for 
various charities. Definite hero. 

All those baseball players who 
gave up the best years of their life 
to fight during World War II are 
heroes. 

Just think of what Ted 
Williams' stats would have looked 
like, had he not lost those prime 
years fighting overseas. Can you 
picture that happening today, if 
the United States got into a major 
military conflict on the level of 
WWII? I can just picture the 
greedy self-congratulatory ath-
letes of today complaining about 
how the war is interrupting their 
rhythms. 

The list of athlete heroes goes 
on. It includes the NFL's work 
with United Way, Dikembe 
Mutombo and his work in his 
homeland of Nigeria, Arthur Ashe 
and his color barrier-breaking and 
AIDS-fighting greatness, and 
many more. 

A hero is someone extra special, 
one who does something extraor-
dinary, something that goes beyond 
the regular bullshit. An athlete hav-
ing a great game is great to talk 
about around the water cooler, but 
he is not a hero.

Fighting the Shortage 
The UCSD Athletic Department is holding a blood drive on 
Tuesday at RIMAC, helping fight the winter blood shortage 

Staff Writer 

It is said that the best gift a 
person can receive is the gift of 
life. With the blood supply criti-
cally low in San Diego County 
right now, the gift of life is cer-
tainly more important than ever. 
Over the holidays, there was a 
drop in donations ' and as a result 
blood is more in demand than 
ever. 

Fortunately, the UCSD athletic 
department is eager to do all it can 
to alleviate the problem. 

Each quarter, the athletic 
department participates in a 
community outreach activity, 
and this winter the activity is a 
blood drive. 

This Tuesday, the athletic 
department, working in conjunc-
tion with the American Red 
Cross, will be sponsoring the 
blood drive. 

Associate Athletic Director 
Ken Grosse has taken a genuine 
interest in encouraging UCSD 
students and faculty to donate 
blood. The goal is to get everyone 

involved and ultimately to help 
increase the blood supply. 

"We're looking to generate at 
least 125 units of blood: Grosse 
said. 

Students who are interested 
should call the athletic depart-
ment at (858)534-4211 or 
(858)534-8460 and sign up to 
donate blood. 

The blood drive will take 
place in the green room of 
RIMAC, which can be entered 
through · the Arena. The doors 
will be open from 8 a.m. to 1 :30 
p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 7:30 
p.m. 

Most slots are taken by coach-
es and athletes, so if more stu-
dents participate, the turnout will 
be phenomenal. 

Keep in mind that it does not 
take much effort to give blood. 
Here are 10 great reasons to 
donate, according to Blood 
Centers of the Pacific Online: 
- Blood transfusions save lives. 
- There is no substitute for 
human blood. 
- Every three seconds, someone 
needs a blood transfusion. 

- About 60 percent of the popula-
tion is eligible to donate blood, yet 
less than 5 percent do so. 
- A pint of blood, separated into 
components, can help up to three 
people. 
- You will make your community a 
safer and better place. 
- Donating fulfills your desire to 
"give back" to the community. 
- You will receive a mini physical 
(blood pressure, temperature, iron 
level). 
- You will learn your blood type. 
- It is safe, simple and it saves 
lives. 

So, if you are at least 17 years 
old, are in good health and weigh 
at least 110 pounds, come to the 
green room at RIMAC on Thesday 
or call the athletic department to 
set up a time when you can come 
in and donate some much-needed 
blood. 

The UCSD athletic depart-
ment has done its part in estab-
lishing this wonderful opportuni-
ty, so the least students can do is 
show an equal commitment to the 
San Diego community by giving a 
little.

ROBERT FULTON 

O ne thing that gets me as a sports journalist and a sports fan is the way that 
sports commentators throw 
~round the word "hero." 

Too often, I will hear a television 
r radio announcer use the word 

when referring to athletes and their 
performances. More often than 
not, the performance is all but 
eroic. An athlete will do his job 

really well under difficult condi-
lions, and he will th us be referred 
o as a hero. 

This is preposterous. 
A running back ran for over 

_00 ya rds with 40 carries during 
th iS year 's NFL playoffs. The 
.1Il nouncer who was covering the 
game had the gall to refer to it as 
" d heroic effort." Heroic? Please. 

Yes, it was difficult, strenuous, 
even gutsy. Hell, I know I could 
not carry the ball 40 times for 
over 200 yards against a playoff 
defense. I doubt many of you 
readers could do it. But if I could, 
would it be heroic? Hardly. Well, 
maybe if it were in the name of 
skinny journalists of average 
height, then it might be heroic. 
But otherwise, no. 

A pitcher will throw nine 
innings of one-hit baseball during 
a big game. It will be called "hero-
ic." Was it heroic? 0, it should be 
called "doing his job," 

The term "heroic" should be 
reserved for true heroes. The thou-
sands who have died during wars 
in the name of America are heroic. 
Firefighters and policemen are 
heroic. A doctor who volunteers 
time in developing countries is a

Volleyball Has 
Tough Date 
With USC 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team tested its powers in front of a 
Division I powerhouse on the road 
and foun d out where it stands -
not in a very good place. 

The Trojans of USC downed 
the Tritons 3-0, winning the three 
games by scores of 30-21, 30-21 
and 31-29. 

UCSD actually threatened in 
the third game, holding a 27-23 
lead at one point. 

A great comeback was not to be, 
though , as USC battled back fo r 
the win. 

It was all USC as they out-hit 
the Tritons 0.291 to 0.079. 

Zack Hite and Griffin Cogorno 
were offensive highlights for 
UCSD, each garnering eight kills 
during the loss. 

Defensively, Donald Chen led 
the way with eight blocks. 

The Tritons will try to get back 
on the winning side of things this 
Friday when they host Pepperdine 
at 7 p.m.

Women's Basketball 
Splits a . Pair at Ho~e 
The Tritons down Los Angeles, suffer 
heartbreaker of a loss to Dominguez Hills 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team had mixed reviews this week-
end, splitting a pair of games. 

On Friday, the Tritons downed 
California State University Los 
Angeles 76-65 but fell Saturday 
night to California State University 
Dominguez Hills 50-49. 

The loss to Dominguez Hills was 
a heanbreaker. 

With four-and-a-half minutes 
left in the game, UCSD held a 46-38 
advantage after an Ali Ginn bucket. 

The Toros stormed back after a 
basket by Tomica Coleman and a 
three-pointer by Fercia Rambacal, 
closing the gap to two, at 46-44. 
UCSD's Maya Fok answered with a 
bucket of her own, but Dominguez 
Hills eventually tied it up with 44 
seconds left at 48-48. 

-With time running down, Toros 
star 11'acee Lewis drove the lane and 
connected with an off-balance junk 
shot, giving her team the lead at 50-
48. 

The Thtons still had six seconds 
left and they gave the ball to their 
star Fok. Fok drove the lane and put 

up a shot Her prayer fell short, but 
she was fouled with only two-tenths 
of a second left. At the line for the 
evening. Fok had been 6-6, but all of 
those had come in the first half. 

She missed the first shot. In an 
attempt to miss the second shot and 
hope for a rebound and game- tying 
miracle shot, Fok. made the foul 
shot. She would end the game 7-8 
from the line. 

Fok led the Tritons with 17 
points and Nicholle Bromley 
chipped in with 10 points and eight 
rebounds. 

Against Los Angeles, UCSD had 
to work a little comeback magic. The 
Tritons found themselves down 38-
33 at the half. They proceeded to go 
on a 43-27 run in the second halffor 
the victory. 

Bromley scored 17 to lead all 
scorers and she had nine rebounds. 
Fok panicipated with 14 points. 

Genevieve Ruvald had a great 
game, almost accomplishing a triple-
double when she scored nine points, 
had 10 rebounds and dished nine 
assists.
