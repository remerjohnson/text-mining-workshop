If CWD is not allowed 10 con-
tinue the series as it exists loday, 
the campus community will be 
deprived or an imporlant educa-
tional. social and cultural resource. 
To change the funding pattern now 
ap plied 10 CWD would invol vl: the 
ASUCSD in micro-managing the 
content of the series. and thereby 
defeal the purpose of having the 
serie . Dismantling CWO would be 
an ill-advised step loward further 
homogeni zation of UCSD.

writing has become the key to suc-
cess in the world of academia and 
the workforce. 

Unle 's the administration 
reforms it GE requirements to 
reneclthe uniformly high standards 
that today's world demands. high 
levels of suc<.:ess will elude UCSD 
graduates. 

Differences do not serv to rna~c 
one college worse than another, but 
ultimately work in our favor. 

As a ,tudent. you can utili ze the 
differenee~ in GE requiremenls to 
your advantage. rather than target-
ing them as inconsistent. It is 
essential for everyone to realize 
Lhat diversilY and variety in educa-
lion are just as important as in the 
"real world." and should not be dis-
mi ssed as "unfair" or " unneces-
sary." Revel in the relati ve unique-

We should have some kind 
of !>ports team s organized for 
people wi thout the time 10 be 
on an actual team . We should 
have more money for intra-
mural s and morc support for 
those because I don't think a 
lot o f people can get involved 
with those becau se they don ' t 
ha ve the money. 

Karen Herbst

The UCSD Guardian 

The "difference," to 
which Rigol is 
referring, is the gap 
that consistently 
appears between the 
S.A.T. scores of 
males and females. 
In 1996, girls posted 
an average score of 
995, whereas the.r 
male counterparts 
scored higher at 
1034... Academically, 
nothing changed 
upon entering 
college ••• However, 
women received
