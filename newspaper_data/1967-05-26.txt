Raise in A .S. Fees 
Illustrate University Growth 

Pend1nc awronl by the Uni-
Yersity Regents, the AS fees for 
1967-68 will be $6.00 per quarter. 
TIle AS Senate took the "oeees-
sary" actiOil at its ftrst meettnc 
on May 15. 

TIle SeDate bas also initiated 
seYeral programs for next year 
aod has scheduled aneod-of-tbe-
year dance for J IIOe 2nd, teaturtnc 
a "b1g-oame" band. 

Accordtnc to Pres. Richard 
Altenboff, "'Ibe AS Senate is 
sbowiDc creat eothusiasm for 

Uampro~s. Wearep~ 
many activities for next year's 
students, aod we will be ea.lJini 
on all studeDts to lend a band in 
torminc policies." 

Altenbotf said tbat fees bad to 
be raised to meet "tile needs 
of a p'owiDC campus. $5000 
alooe will CO to a pIJd secretary." 
"Aud" be added "we will be , . , 
spendj~ much more mODeY OIl

Gary Cartis, IW8r dtriskm 
SeDator, saJd. "We c:aaaot CCIO-

TIle Senate felt that the present 
budget of $15,000 offers too little 
to the students. "With the added 
revenues," Altenboff explained, 
"we can bring in big bands, big 
names, big sbows. You will see 
a (reat transformation in the AS 
next year. We're out to get 
tbings dooe." 

As an tndieation of this change, 
the dance OIl June 2 will be an 
important event tor the new 
Senate. "We want the students 
to knOw that we are still here," 
SUze Dascomb said. "This date 
is perfect, tor students can let 
out steam before they retreat to 
their rooms for tIle finals of 
the following week." 

In otber actiOll, the Senate 
began plans for orientation week

Officers Foresee 
Promising Year 
"The administration bas not 

done as well as it mlibt have 
done in the last three years 
toward improv~ relations with 
students, but we are always open 
to constructive suuestions on 
bow this environment can be 
changed." 

So said Chancellor John Gal-
braith at the first annual installa-
tion of the new Associated stu-
dents officers. In a spirit of 
cooperation, the new student offi-
cers and the administrators ex-
changed ideas for the future at 
the installation on Friday, May 
the 19th. 

Chancellor Galbraith be~ his 
talk by sayin( that .. Adminis-
trators have the facility for ex-
pressin( themselves but succeed 
in sayin( nothin&. We are not 
outside the ASUCSD," he said. 
"We are very much involved." 

Alter comparing his own ex-
perience as student body presi-
dent at the University of Miami 
(Oxford, Ohio) with that of Rich-
ard Moncreitf and Jim Heflin, 
ex-president and vice-president, 
respectively, the Chancellor dts-
cussed the real nature of the 
administration's place ·in the uni-
versity. "The administration 
is to the faculty as a tree is 
to a d~. But what Is most 
essential in the UCSD environ-
ment is a close mutual confidence 
in one another--administration 
and students. The administration 
is willing to listen to students." 

Commencement 
to be Held June 14 

The first public commence-
ment exercises at the University 
of California at San Diego w111 
be held on June 14, 1967 at 
10:30 a.m. in the Urey Hall P1a.u. 
Chancellor John S. Galbraith will 
be present to a<:k1ress the gradu-
at1nc students. The Reverend 
John G. Huber, Pastor of the 
University Lutberan ChurCh, will 
pronounce tbe invocation anrl the 
benediction. 

Tbe Grossmont College Con-
cert Band w111 provide the music 
for the cere mOllY. Doctorate, 
Master and Bacbelor dep'ees 
will be awarded. Immediately 
tollowin( commencement, there 
will be a receptiOil OOld on the 
lawn north of Urey Hall. 

In past years, receptions hoo-
oring ooly graduate students were 
held at the Cbancellor's resi-
deoce, but this year, for the tirst 
Ume, seniors will participate in 
the graduatiOil ceremOllies. 

Tbe tradlttooal academic pro-
cession will be led by Dr. Dellllis 
L. Fox, UCSD Marshal and Chair-
man of the Committee 00 Public 
CeremooJes. Chancellor Gal-
braitb, admtnistrative offtclals 
and department chairmen II 
participate in the procession. 

Academic attire for studeDts 
partJclpating in tile commence-
meDt elercises will be anilable 
ID the lobby of Urey Hall on 
J1lD8 12 and 13. 

Following the Chancellor, Pro-
vost Bradner aa1ressed the in-
comin& officers, namely Richard 
Altenboff and Herv Sweetwood. 
and warned tOOm, "You will be 
ridiculed and subjected to a lot 
of glaring lights, but if you can 
handle tOOse tasks in a respon-
sible manner, and keep from 
flunking out, you wUl be very 
successful." 

Later in the evenin&, Richard 
Monereiff, the outgoing AS Presi-
dent and a graduatin& senior this 
year, described his administra-
tion as a &roup of ideally-minded 
students "that took six to seven 
months to get moving." He 
thanked other interested students 
for brinilng "important issues 
to us," and extended his ttnnks 
to Dean Murphy and Provost 
Bradner. "Mr. Blackstock must 
be given special thanks," Mon-
creiff continued, "for &tYing fi-
nancial advice to the coffee house, 
which bas &rown from a $30 to 
a $200 per day enterprise. II 

Following Moncreiff, the new 
AS President, Richard Altenboff. 
a junior majoring in biology, 
addressed his remarks primarily 
to the eight senators at the ban-
quet. "WhetOOr you have new 
ideas or not, you had too optim-
istic outlook before the elections 
too you could improve thin&s at 
UCSD. If you maintain this 
enthusiasm for the rest of your 
terms of office, you can do the 
job needed to be done. You do 
not need to display an Annie 
Besant fervor, by any means, 
but at least remain enthusiastic." 

(Annie Besant was an English 
1 ader in the Tbeosoptust move-
ment and a prominent political 
figure in India alter 1889. Noted 
for her views on birth control, 
sbe was also president of the 
Indian National Coogress in 1917, 
too only non-Ind.ian ever to bold 
such a post in pre-independent 
1OOIa.) 

After some remarks made by 
Herv Sweetwood, ASVice-Presl-
dent-elect, Dean Murphy spoke of 
bis desire to maintain "l totally 
effective aod coocen1al partner-
ship" with studeots. 

After the speecbes. Richard 
Chipwood, Associate Chief Just-
ice of the student Supreme Court, 
swore the otIicers, senators and 
committeemen into offIce. 

In cooclusiOll Jim Heflin said, 
"You new otItcers can make 
every dream and promlse a 
reality tor the ASUCSD. And I 
bave every reason to pI edict a 
very successful year to ~ome." 

Present at the InaucurlPJ Ban-
quet were all the officers. sena-
tors, members ~ the JolntCom-
mittee OIl Student AtlaJ.r , torm r 
senators aod otIteers, and many 
euests. D1stiDpisbed visitors

Pap Z - TRITOlf TIllES 

flllt,"" ""lo,.,6r, .n4 I'ollcy 
A II.w 14 •• , 

The T riton Times, a bimonthly publication, has been conceived 
with the idea that a new picture of the University students is long 
overdue. The image of this country's students has been so badly 
twisted and distorted that the student community is considered by 
many of those outside the education system to be a separate and de-
cadent society. On the other hand, this newspaper intends to throw 
out a new and constructive message and to properly represent 
that great majority of students who consider themselves done a 
disservice by the current Wlfavorable image of college youth a-
cross the nation and around the world. 

This editorial philosophy does not mean that anyone ideology or 
another will be favored in the pronouncement of the respective 
views of each. It does mean, however, that in order to be represented 
in this newspaper a statement of opinion or belief must be written 
with a sense of responsibility to the readers of this publication. 

Apart from the editorial philosophy of the Triton Times, the 
editor wishes to include in this first issue, a statement of the in-
tents and purposes of this publication. By a majority vote of the 
staff, the Triton Times intends: l)To prepare a newspaper which 
expresses the interests of the University of Califo'rnia at San Di-
ego and ist student body; 2) To present news and events as objec-
tively as possible; 3) To cultivate the varied interests at the Uni-
versity of California at San Diego, i.e. sports, social life, special 
curricular activities' and community functions of concern to the stu-
dents; 4) To operate as a non-profit organization. 

In seadiDc Editorials, Letters to the Editor, or other articles to be printed, the following considerations 
sbouJd be made: 1) The Triton Times will not accept responsibility for ide~ or beliefs set forth in 
EcUtorials or other such articles written by students outside the newspaper; 2) Letter..; to the Editor 
must be s1ped and legible; 3) These Letters to the Editor should be of reasonable length, not to ex-
ceed ZOO wordS; 4) The editor's decisions coocernin&' Guest Editorials and Letters wUl be final and 
wiD be made according to space, quality and taste; 5) All articles sent to the Triton Times should be 
sent In Room 342, Building 250, Mathews Campus, UCSD; 6) The deadline for all articles to be printed 
is tile MoodIly before the forthcoming issue.

144 screaming and fe stive fall s 

were treated to a real thriller 
as the Del Maulers edged out 
the Tiger Lillies, 11-9, to fini sh 
the season undefeated and capture 
the 1967 intramuralCoedSottba ll 
Championship. Umpiring was 
Gawless for this pressure-
packed game, with no more than 
18 questionable calls. 

Anderson drove in the tirst 
two runs with a long double 
after singles by Finkler and Sund-
strom. Alter Jones flied out to 
Betche r. Brcaded lined out to 
Partridge and Partridge fired to 
Shine at second to double An-
derson up. 

The Del Maulers capitalized 
on 3 Tiger Lillieserrorsto score 
5 big runs in the bottom of the 
first. Shine drove in Ostle r 
from econd in the bottom of the 
200 ( 0 make the score 6-2. 

Tiger LHlies got 2 of the rUlTs 
back in the top of the 3rd when 
FLnkl r and Anderson scored on 
a throwing error to the plate. 

Del Maulers then clinched the 
game in the bottom of th 4th 
when they scored 4 runs on 5 hits 
and a big Tiger Lillies error. 

Trailing 10-4 in the top of the 
6tlj, Jones doubled to center and 
Broaded s ingled him in. Baker 
struck out, Gable lined a s ingle 

TRACK 
The track team s hared in the 

winnings by accumulating a final 
record of 4 wins and 4 losses. 
The team placed 5th ou t of 
thirteen at the Chapman invita-
tional and brought back 28 tro-
phies fr om the University oC 
California at Rive r side invita-
tional. Bob Smith had 4 out of 
the 28 trophies. 

Many school records were 
broken this year. Lane Mason 
ran a 9:27.0 minute 2-m ile and 
a 4:31.5 minute mile . The former 
440 relay and mile relay records 
and Gates was safe on an error. 
Sawin lined out to left, and Finkler 
hit a clutch single to drIve in 
2 runs. Sundstr om then drove 
in the 4th run of the inning with 
a double, but was picked off at 
2nd when Mika fired the ball in 
to Barker who in turn threw to 
Ostler. This was the turning 
point of the game (voted the key 
play oC the 1967 Intramural Coed 
Softball season) as the inning was 
brought to an abrupt halt. 

The Del Mauler'S scored again 
in the 6th and with the score 
11-8, Anderson bit a hard shot 
to short but Ostler took the ball 
and threw out Clay. Jones boomed 
a triple to left center that got by 
West. Broaded's fly to left drove 
in Jones to make the !)core 11-9. 
Baker flied out to Chimarusti to 
and the game.

TEAM 
also fell. Overall, every field 
event record was broken except 
for one. Tom Biglion(fresbman) 
high jumped 5'10" for a school 
record. Roy Dimon was very 
consistent in the sbot put and 
discus. His best put was 46'3"; 
best throw, 136'9.5". Bob Nasset 
holds the 1966 record for tbe 
triple jump at 42'l'O.5". He also 
set a record Cor tbe javelin at

the nod over Partridge, Finkler, 
Horrman, Litchfield, and Stacey. 
Shine 5p()rted a nifty .529 SA in 
the playo!fs, and scored 9 and 
drove in 10 runs, as well as 
hittLng 4 big homers. However, 
his outstanding performance was 
in the fie Id as he steadied the 
sometimes unpredictable Del

CROSS 
Tbe Unitersily ~ California at 

San Diego IotercoUegtate Cross 
Country Team showed a marked 
improvement oYer last year. 
Several preylously formidable 
teams, such as Cal Western and 
Chapman, made easy prey tbis 
year, and tbe individual perform-
ances cootinued to improve. Yet 
in reviewing the seasoo, one reels 
tbat the academic pressures Ilere 
are such that the rWlDers are 
not finding their true potentiaL 
This factor appears in sever I 
forms; the drop in team perrorm-
ance around midterm exams, the 
spotty attendance at practice. the 
eHects of lack of sleep were 

\ 

all evident. This problem may 
be less acute in the upper 
division as the students have 
fewer courses and learn to plan 
their time more carefully. 

The opening meet showed the 
potential of the 1966 squad, as 
returning sophomores Dennis 
Morrison and Mike Morales 
placed 1-2, rollowed by s opho-
more Charles Lindsey, who filled 
the gap left by Greg Nieren-
garten, U.S. Navy. This 1-2-3 
punch overwbelmed Cal Western 
and Chapman. SiDce tbis was 
the opening meet 011 !be Dell' 
UCSO Cross Country Course, 
Co-captaLn Dermis Morrisoo's 
31: 32 stood as the course record. 

Not for long, howeYer. TIle 
folloYing Saturday, JoeO'COmJOr 
of San Diego Track and Field 
put tbe open record at 27:27, 
Jobn Slavin ~ UC RiYerside left 
!be collegiate record at 28:31 
and Tom Eklund (SanOiegoState) 
registered 30: 12 for the Fresb-
man Collegiate record. TIle 
UCSD team was overpowered by 
tbese three teams, but defeated 
Cal Western. TIle fast pace 
resulted Ln a ooe-minute reduc-
tion for everyone but John Haury, 
who cut 3.5 minutes from his 
time of the previous week. 

'HOTOS 8Y. 

In tbe next two meets, UCSD 
dereated Cal Western in a home 
and away excbange. Whittier's 
presence was felt in the fir st 
meet; led by Lew Jones they 
copped places 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. 
Co-captain Mike Morales (UCSO) 
turned in a fine performance, 
running well ahead of Cal 
Western's John Condit and in 
both races setting the course 
record or 29: 29 for a UCSD 
s tudent. 

The UCSD harriers found the 
Cbapman Invitational full of well-
matched competition, fini shed 5th 
out of 10 colleges. Third UCSD 
runner to finish was sophomore 
John Haury, who continued to im-
prove. M ike Morales again paced 
tbe team, his 22:42 tor four 
muddy miles was good enough 
for loth place in the meet. 

Tbe final meet was held in 
the pouring rain on the Riverside 
Campus of the University of 
California. Dennis Morrison 
closed out a fine season, clocking 
a remarkably fast average mile 
time despite the rain. Freshman 
Jim Pokorny turned in a sur-
prisingly good performance for 
bis only race of the season. 

Accurate perspective as to the 
relative atandlng of UCSlJ amoni 
the competition may be drawn 
from this statistic: Tbirteen 
colleges proved too strong for 
UCSD this year as opposed to 
eight whicb wer consistantly de-
feated. The individual times 
cootinued to improve tbroughout 
tbe season, and it is boped that 
tbis condition will continue in the 
years to come as cross country 
gains tradition at UCSD.

SPORTS AT UNIV. Of c..IF. 
Tbe facilities are not large 

nor are tbey totally new. The 
building looks like it might wash 
away with the next heavy rain, 
and the track Is bard-packed 
rock. 

But the people associated with 
the Phy.slcal Education Depart-
ment of the San Diego campus 
of the University ot Callfornla 
are convinced they can buUd a 
modern sports program to tit 
the needs of the students. Direc-
tor or athletics Howard Hunt and 
department cbalrman Ted Forbes 
are guiding an ever- expanding 
program that must be able to 
accomodate some 3000 students 
for next year, and 10,000 by 
1975. 
N12. ~ scholarship§. 

The scbool offers no atd to 
hopeful athletes , but Hunt feels 
that tbis does not have to hold 
back expansion. "We would like 
to bave a program that meets 
the student needs," he said ... Any 
sports that are not now offered 
are mainly those that lack student 
support. U tbe kids will teU us 
what they want, we'll try our 
best to deliver." Many teams 
were organized with just a few 
athletes . "I had eight boys come 
to me and say, 'Coach, we want 
to run cross country.' Since it 
only takes seven to or ganize a 
team, we ran." 
Teams .!2Y.ili! with schedules 

Generally, new teams are run 
with J. V. schedules to gradually 
build for the following year. The 
basketball team handled a mucb 
more ambitious s late than tbe 
previous year, and the track team 
travelled seve ral times up the 
coast to take on larger opponents. 

Besides basketball and track 
and field, tbe school has teams in 
cross country, wrestling, sailing, 
rugby, gall, tennis and agraduate 
soccer team. 

Coaches Hunt and Johnson 
~ pJ.an.s 

in the immediate Mure, tbe 
students will find the facUitles 
open now and tllrough tbe sum-
mer. 

"Someone will be here in the 
department all summer," said 
Hunt. The equipment includes the 
sailLng and weight eqUipment. 
Unfortunately, the Natatorium 
will probably not be opened until 
the Fall, but when it (s, it wiU 
be available to all students. "We 
hope to organize a swimmLngand 
a water polo team at that time," 
said Coacb Hunt. 

The gymnasium should be 
ready by the spring quarter of 
1968, along with its tennis courts 
and grass playing fields, and with 
this Hunt (s hopeful tor a baseball 
and crew team. "We might give 
volleyball a start, too." 
Athletes anxious 

The schedules tor the com~ 
year are being worked out now. 
The new racilities will in some 
cases be ready, such as the cross 
country course and the 440 oval 
along Miramar Road. 

In December tbe All-l I cross 
country meet will be held on tbe 
UC course, with most of tbe 
campuses of the UnlVerslty 
sending teams. "Right IJOW we 
have lrvine, Riverside, Davis, 
Santa 8arbaraandposslblyUCLA 
AND Berkeley entered for thE 
meet," Hunt said. 

Captain Dave Kuhn or the UC 
track team is very pleased with 
tbe past year and readily awa.1ts

What force would be requlredfor

watermelon of unknown mass 
from tile seventh noor of Urey

times acceleration). 

Tile watermelon clrop tbls year

UCSD and will again be held in 
the area of Urey Hall. 

Tbis year's splat promises 
to be the biggest and best Water-
melon Splat ever. In the tradition 
01 the two previous splats, a 
watermelon queen wiU be chosen 
from several candidates v yin( for 
this bonor. The queen will throw 
a HUGE watermelon from tile 
seventb noor of Urey Hall hoping 
to spread the fragments to a 
greater distance than that dis-
tance achieved by the Class of 
1969's watermelon. 

Further details for the Splat 
will be announced at a later date 
by the AS, wblch Is sponsoring

So, physics students, since this

The book, partially fImded bya

books to serve as a book selec-
tloo aid for college libraries. 
It is the ftrst such compilation 
since Charles B. Shaw's "List 
ot Books for College Libraries," 
publisbed in 1931. 

Publleatioo of the list grew out 
of tbe University's New Cam-

basic book collections for the 
three new University campuses, 
San Oiego, Santa Cruz, and Irvine. 

The new book Lists 53,400

A representative of Chapman 
Colleee, Orange, Calif., visited 
tile University of Calilornia, San 
Diego last Wednesday, May 24 , 
to discuss a semester abroad 
probram on the SS Ryndam, the 
world's only noatin\: campus, 
witb interested students. 

The International Student Or-
pnlzation set up a display table 
on Monday, Tuesday and Wed-
nesday to acquaint students with 
the pro&Tam, wblch is similar 
to that of tbe well-known "Uni-
versity of the Seven Seas." 

The \:oal of tile World Campus 
Afloat program, which is admin-
istered by Chapman's Divisionof 
International Education, Is to 
combine education with the ex-
periences of world travel. Eighty 
liberal arts courses are offered 
aboard ship in a one-semester 
transfer program. 

During its current spring se-
mester at sea, the "Ryndam" 
carries 135 undergraduate and 
graduate students and 70 faculty 
and stan to ports in South Amer-
ica, Africa, and Europe. Tile 
107-day vO}'3&'e will terminate 
in New York May 25. 

Fall semester students gen-
erally depart from New York, 
travel around the world via the 
Mediterranean Sea, Suez Canal 
and the Red Sea to Asia, and 
return to Los Angeles by way of 
Japan and Honolulu. Sprin& se-
mester itineraries change ac-
cording to regional acade mic 
interests. 

While at sea, studeRts attend 
classes six days a week with 
formal studies supplemented by 
pre-arranged, 1n-port activities 
related to course material.

Tbree University ofCalifomia,

mating their way to stardom 10 
sbow business. Jobn Grana, Greg 
Gushwa, and DarreU Icenogle 
have been together only eight 
months, but have already made 
a reputattonfor their singing trio, 
"Threes Company". On April 27 , 
the Today Show gave tile trio 
their first big break, allowing 
tbem to perform on a nationwide 
TV show. This boost enabled 
them to break out of the ladles 
society circles and to establish 
themselves as known singers. 
Fan mail as well as new booklngs 
began pouring in from such places 
as Louisiana, Michigan, 'and New 
Jersey. Betty Lanigan, an NBC 
public relations official, has now 
begun talking to RCA about their 
future and tapes are enroute to 
Hollywood and New York offices. 
The folksingers met as fellow 
inmates in Beagle Hall and com-
bined much hard work with a 
varied repertoire to produce a 
very promisIng singing group.

(Conttoued from Pue 1) 

"Tbe Ne1f'lAft was quite reluc-
taot to debate Mr. Luce," Booth 
said. "Even Professor Marcuse 
declined to deblte.... We feel 
that It would make a more toter-
esting dlscuS$iOll 11 someone dId 
tate up our cbal1eoce." 

According to Booth, YR's wiU 
offer many speaters next year, 
perhaps one a month. "We hq)e 
-to get such prominent Repub-
licans as Senator Charles Percy, 
General Curtis LeMay and Coo-
&Tessman Bob Wilson to speak 
at UCSD. Even Governor Reagan 
might show up. We are here 
to offer an alternative to tile 
Left's positions and we hope 
students will listen to both 
sides. "
