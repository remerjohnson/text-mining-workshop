By Christina Rhudy 
Staff Wfller 

More than 100 high . chool stu-
dcnts from around San Diego coun-
ty lOured UCSD's PISCES fusion 
lahoratory Saturday as pari of 
General Atomics' High Schoo l 
Science day. 

PISCES is one of several labs 
investigating dif-
ferent aspects of 
fusion and its 
potential app lica-
ti ons as a world-
wide ene rgy 
source. The lab 
conducts exten-
si ve rescarch in 
plasma physics 
and fusion tech -
nology. 

quium that provided background 
on the major husiness venture~ of 
Genera l Atomics, introducing them 
to the idea of fusion as a fu ture 
alternative energy source. 

At General Atomics, scientists 
arc looking toward fusion to meet 
future energy needs. Fusion is the 
process that powers the sun and 

stars, via a reac-
tion in which two 
atoms of hydro-
gen combine 
together, or fuse, 
to foml an atom 
of helium. 

Some of 

The 3!!- mem-
ber PISCES staff

with General 
Atomic s 
re,earchers, and

"You'd like to see

this generation 
doesn't use up

potential materi al s for usc in a

One of the materiab presenlly 
under siudy is bery llium, a light , 
relatively siahle clement that is 
fairly durable, allowing scientists 
to con~talltly run tesls. 

However, a small percentage of 
the popu lation may experience a 
severe allergic reaction to bery lli -
um dusl upon exposure. 

To minimize the risk, PISCES 
scientists wear protective suils and 
breathe through respirators when-
ever working in the lab, which is 
monitored by a camera with a live 
I ntemet feed.

Interleague Play \Nill 
Boost Competition and 
Interest in America's 
Favorite Pastime 
By Dan Sween.y 
Senior Staff Wnter 

Imagine. if you wi ll. Los Angeles 
Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo slinging his 
splil -fingercd faslball againsl Oakland 
slugger Mark McGwirc, a man known to 
scnd fastballs 10 epi<.: altitudes where the 
ange ls Ihemselves fear 10 tread. 

I know it 's hard to envision. but pic-
tun! Juan Gonlalel, Ihe Puerto Ri can 
dcmi-god who crushes hanging curve· 
h.llb, hitting at olurado's launching 
rad. oors Field . While we're in the 
rea lm or fantasy. Ihink of Mr. Iron Man 
himself. Cal Ripken. digging in at the 
plate to racc the guy after whom they 
want to rename the y Young award, 
Greg Maddux . 

Well. we don 't have 10 fantasile any-
more, do we') This season. thanks to the 
advent or interlcague play, the hcst final -
ly wi ll he playing the best. Great match-
ups thai have otherwise been "what if ... " 
scenarios will become rea lity for the first 
lime. A whole new world of different 
environments, diffcrent fans and new sit-
ualions will be realized. II 's about time. 

But what's this'! A certain outspoken 
group of crackpot traditionalist s would 
havc you bclieve that Ihis crossing of 
league borders is a "basic undermining 
of the purity of America's game." If 
these so-called puri sts had their way, 
fans would slill be watching forgotten 
tcams like the Brooklyn Dodger& play 
during daylight hours at dinosaur ball -
parks like the Polo Grounds in 154-game 
seasons. 

What these fanatics need to get 
through their thick skulls is that not even 
the mo 't stalwart of American institu-
tions, baseball, is immune to change. 

Thankfully, in the case of interleague 
pl ay, clearer heads have prevailed, and 

the new cross-league format will be insti-
tuted on a tri al basis. Teams in the 
National League West wi ll play each of 
Iheir American League Wcst countcrparts 
four times for a lotal of 16 games. The 
fi ve-Ieam Eas t and entml divisions, 
meanwhile, wi ll play three against each 
corresponding team for a total of 15 
games. 

Opponents of Ihe system, however, are 
crying a river ovcr the changc, saying that 
the crossover will cheapen the All -Star 
Game and World Series. After all. they 
claim, Ihese were the onl y times the two 
leagues met beforc. Purists demand that 
the old syslem be preserved. 

I have four words for the puri sts and 
their efforts - "Too little. 100 late." 

You sec, interleague critics should 
have made their push far sooner Ihan 
now. The fact of the matter is that the 
seedlings of interleague play were irrevo-
cably planted years ago, back when 
Major League Ba eball decided to reali gn 
and creale three di visions. 

At that point, it became clear that 
major league baseball's grand scheme 
was to eventually have 30 teams, arraying 
the leagues to support six di visions with 
five teams each. At that point, interleague 
play was a foregone conclusion - clear-
ly, IS -team leagues would not work 
because on any given day, one team 
would not be playing. Only by conglom-
erating the leagues could a happy medium 
be struck. 

Though the cross-league action is 
being performed on a "trial basis" this 
year, all indications are that the new for-
mat will be a resounding success. After 
all, ever since the infamous labor shut-
down a few years ago, baseball has been 
crying for something to get people excit-

Play Between the nNo 
Leagues \Nill Only Benefit 
Money-Hungry Owners 
and Television Executives 
By Ryan Olson 
Staff Writer 

Spring has returned to San Diego. For a 
great many Americans, the coming of spring 
signals the relurn of baseball. 

The season starts slowly with pitchers and 
catchers reporting to spring training. Yet, it 
ends with fine-tuned baseball teams facing 
each other on Ihe field. Each team hopes to win 
enough games to cam a pennant and, perhaps, 
even a World Series title. 

As a baseball fan , I wish for nothing more 
than to go down to the construction zone that is 
Jack Murphy Stadium (or Qualcomm Park at 
Jack Murphy Field, or whatever) on a clear, 
beautiful San Diego day and watch the like of 
Ken Caminiti, Tony Gwynn or Steve Finley 
dive after a ground ball or chase down a lazy ny 
ball in the summer sun. However, the owners of 
Major League Baseball have a plan to throw the 
system out of lurch - the introduction of inter-
league play. 

After almost a hundred years of separation, 

• 

the owners want to bring the two leagues -
the National and the American - together to 
compete on a regular basis. 

Previously, the two leagues only competed 
together twice a year-once during the middle 
of the season at the All-Star Game and again in 
the fall during the World Series. 

Despite the tremendous potential that inter-
league play has for the rejuvenation of the 
game, now is not the time for such a scheme. 

After more than 90 years, the current set-up 
still works like a charm. Millions of fans watch 
baseball every year, to follow their team or 
their players for beller or worse. Now the own-
ers want to change the entire system. 

While they have their individual reasons for 
introducing inter league play, I'd like to wager 
that most owners were thinking only about 
money when discussing this drastic move. • 

[nterleague play could ound like the per-
fect cure to Major League Baseball's problems 
over the pa t few years. The mere prospect of

COMMENTARY: The student publication, Tha Yellow Pages, abuses its opportunity to become a potentially 
progressive medium through its perpetuation of derogatory stereotypes and misogynistic content 

ASIAN PuBLICATION HURTS Irs TARGET AUDIENCE 
By ..... 
.... Idler Yoon 
Senior Staff Writers 

As Asian-American women, we 
are offended, insulted and embar-
rassed by the portrayal of Asian-
Americans in Tha Yellow Pages. It 
is a shame that, given the rare occa-
sion in which Asian-Americans on 
this campus speak collectively, Tho 
Yel/ow Pages does so in a self-dep-
recatory, stereotyped manner. 

Asian-Americans are not a 
homogeneous group. Yet, Tho 
Yel/ow Pages reduces the "average 
Asian life" to cars, alcohol, food, 
sex, cigarettes and materialism, 
hence perpetuating stereotypes 
detrimental to Asian-Americans as 
individuals. We are not denying 
that the Asian-Americans Tho 
Yellow Pages describes do not 
exist: The stereotypes make sense 
because the few Asians that it 
describes are highly visible and fit 
the mold. 

Deemed the "model minority," 
Asian-Americans have purportedly 
set the standard for others: Work 
hard enough and you will receive 
your just desserts. Affixed onto 
Asian-Americans, this stereotype 
has been the starting ground for 
unwelcome, offensive over-gener-
alizations - studying is our liveli-
hood, we throw off all the curves, 
we all wear glasses, we are socially 
inept. 

In diminishing the issue of aca-

demie achievement to a mere 
obsession, Tho Yellow Pages trivi-
alizes the principle that belies that 
"obsession." Most Asian immigrant 
parents highly value academic suc-
cess, hoping to live vicariously 
through their children's achieve-
ments. The pressure to succeed is a 
serious one: Many second-genera-
tion Asian-Americans have resort-
ed to uicide due to perceived fail-
ure. By making light of the issue, 
Tho Yellow Pages neglects to 
acknowledge the significance of 
t his pressure. 

Stereotypes of Asian-Americans 
as the model minority are so preva-
lent that when an Asian-American 
speaks of is ues other than chemi-
cal formulas, she is seen as the 
exception. More likely, she is not 
really heard. The model minority 
quietly does her work, accepts the 
SIOIUS quo and strives for the top. 
Once there, she settles into compla-
cency, never to make any waves -
or SO the myth goes. The exception 
is the aberrant deviant who is 
henceforth marked. 

Tho Yellow Pages' depiction of 
Asian-American women is insult-
ing. During World War II, the 
Vietnam War and the Korean War, 
American servicemen brought 
home Asian war-brides. Apprai sed 
as docile, submissive, obedient and 
passive, Asian women henceforth 
became a desired commodity.

American woman as sex objects

ic" appeal - the exotically slanted 
eyes, the long, dark hair, the quiet 
nature. 

As Asian-American women, we 
are striving to transcend that image 
of the sexualized object, passive to 
the male gaze. When Tho Yellow 
Pages staff plasters a full -page pic-
ture of a scantily clad Sung Hi Lee, 
the efforts of Asian-American 
women striving for change are seri-
ously impeded. 

Simply mentioning that Lee is 
the recipient of a scholarship does 
not neutralize the misogyni tic 
implications inherent in the sexual-
ly sugge tive photo. 

The juxtaposition of the photo 
of a near-naked Asian-American 
woman wilh that of the photo of a 
fully clothed Asian man further 
perpetuates Ihe derogatory notion 
that Asian-American women are 
sexual objects. Jackie Chan is 
described as a "superstar" with 
"world-wide appeal ." Tho Yellow 
Pages emphasizes hi s achieve-
ments and keen business ense, 
whereas Lee is "erotic," with a 
"slunning body" that makes "guys' 
mouths drop." 

We anticipate comments that we 
are simply uPlight, prudish Korean 
women, intent on raining on the 
"let 's laugh at Asians" parade. 
However, the issue at hand is more 
complicated. It is discouraging that 
Tho Yel/ow Pages slaff perpetuates 
self-deprecatory stereotypes on a 

campus in which Asian-American 
already lack an assertive voice. 

Furthermore, these stereotypes 
impede the efforts of individual 
Asian-Americans striving to tran-
scend the demarcated boundaries 
prescribed by these slereotypes. 

Tho Yellow Pages should live 
up to its self-proclaimed creed as a 
"worthy Asian·oriented newspa-
per." The staff should construc-
tively employ the publication as a 
tool to inform the UCSD commu-
nity of issues unique to Asian· 
Americans - who comprise a sig-
nificant portion of the student 
body - such as generational and 
cultural gaps, ethnic divisiveness 
and cohesive group identities, to 
name a few. 

Stereotypes impede progress, 
thwart self-perception and misin· 
form others. Asian -Americans 
must first develop an underSland-
ing for each other, because 
"Asian" includes Korean, 
Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, 
Indian, Vietnamese, Thai -
among others. Stereotypes are 
fallacious over-gene~alizat ions. 
Perpetuating slereotypes will only 
hurt us. 

We are a new generation of 
Asian-Americans. We must refuse 
to stand in silence, reject imposed 
passivity and shed our parents' 
clothing. We must assert our voices 
and police each other from perpet-
uating detrimenlal stereotypes.

THE 
EDITOR'S 
SOAPBOX 

Megan Klein 
ASSOCiate Opinion Editor 

Two weekends ago, I flew home 
to Napa for a quick vacati on. While 
in the area. I visi tcd my frie nd who 
attcnds UC Davis. Wc wcnt out for 
lunch and to seek out a few of our 
old high school friends . 

Wc parked ncar the edge of 
campus and walked toward the 
center. We walked on and on. past 
donns. cafeterias. gyms. classrooms. 
pools, libraries and offices. It 
seemed as if we were wlaking 
forever - that place i huge! It mu t 
take an eternity to get from class to 
class - I can't imagine having to 
walk everywhere. 

Apparently, most st udents a 
Davis don' t like to imagine it, 
either. Davis is the mecca of 
bicycles. skatcboards and 
rollerblades. The entire school is 
designed for them. There are streets 
open only to ' non-motorized. 
wheeled vehicles. There are bicycle 
rack.s outside every building, on 
every corner. You just can't go 
anywhere without running into 
someone wheeling about. 

Although UC Davi is huge. it 's 
designed so you can get around 
eas ily and efficientl y. Considering 
that UCSD is the second largest UC 
campus, why isn' t our school 
designed to includc bicycle and 
other altcrnate forms of 
transportation? 

It tal<- es forevcr to get from one 
sidc of our school to the uther. I 
have always had trouble gelling 
arou nd campus. During my 
frcshman year. I lived on the fourth 
floor of Harl an Hal l at Warren, This 
location, I am convi nced. is as far 
away as possible from the rc~ t of 
the buildings on campus. 

GClling to cla~s wa~ a trial that 
year. It took seven whole mlllutcs 
just to get to my closest cia,s in 
Warren Lecture Hall. Meanwhile, 
traveling to my chemistry class In 
York was an even bigger prnhlcm. 
The fin,t time I W\:llt there. It took 
me halfan hour. OK. Given I was a 
bit lost and most likely took the 

longc~ t way. it was a longer trip 
thml It had to hc, Yet thi\ Journey 
onl y shonened to about 20 minutes

The UCSD Guardian FEATU RE 9 

GUARDIAN 

In an exclusive inteNiew with the Guardian I 
Chancellor Robert Dynes shares his thoughts 

on issues ranging from ASE recognition 
to UCSD's ranking 
as a top university 

Guardian: How will SP·l and SP-2 
affect UCSD? t e U ·e ts 
Dynes: Let me answer that questi on 
with a equel. We sent out 13.000 
admission lettcrs. Our goal is to cnroll 
about 3.000. There WlS a drop in the 
numbcr of Afri can-American. 
Mexican -American and Native-
American applicants - which really 
upset me - but the number of those 
minorities admitted increased. If you 
compare the newly admitted class with 
those of the previous class: the medi-
an GPA. 3.96. is the same. but the 
SAT scores are up - even though we 
admitted about 1.300 more students. 
So we' re anticipating a little bit of 
growth this year. The final crucial step 
is in recruiting those students. 
Altho ..... UCSD Is a good school, 
It falls behind UC Berkeley and 
UCLA In general perception. How 
will you help us move up In the 
perception ladder? 

The question is: What arc you 
going to do? Thc reputation of a 
school comes from the students and 
alumni. U Bcrkeley and UCLA arc 
much older schools and so they have a 
broad alumnus base. UCSD is 36 years 
old. so it's goi ng to takc a while to 
build up an alumnus basc that's evcn 
close to these other schools, 
Applications indicate thai the quality 
of the studcnts applying to UCSD is 
thc samc as those app lying to UC 
Berkeley and UCLA. Students have 
ligured it out - mayhe your p;lrcnb 
havcn' t figu red it out. 

In terms of faculty quality. therc's 
no uouht that . for l:onvcntional and

ARE You GLAD You CAME TO UCSD? 
Interviews by Dan Sweeney • Photography by Zaki Rubenstein 

I like the fact that no 
one thinks they 're having 
fun around here, so it 
makes my expectations a 
lot lower. If I'm hanging 
out by myself it feels 
like ... fun . There's nothing 
on campus but campus 
itself. There comes a point 
here where you have to 
branch out. I've been all 
over the place in San 
Diego, and this school is 
unique in that it forces me 
to do that 

Yes, I'm very glad I 
came to UCSD. Look at 
the day today - it's beau-
tiful! And also because 
there are lots of girls that I 
can gi ve these flowers 10. 

The school I don ' t 
regret coming to at all - I 
think the education is great 
- but I hate the town. It 
sucks. It 's five to 10 years 
behind everywhere else; 
ii 's so conservative. I real-
ly don ' t do anything other 
than school down here. 

I'm in the dorms so it's 
not that social. I had Ihe 
option to go to Berkeley 
and in a way I kind of wish 
I'd gone there. It's been 
fun , I guess. I've only been 
here a couple of monlhs. [ 
don't know. I'm kind of 
"whatever" about it. 

Yeah, I'm glad I went, I 
met a Jot of good friends. 
The education is good, but 
the school spirit sucks. No 
one even knows what the 
mascot is.

Has the quality of the health

despite all the cutbacks? 

There arc horror ~to r i c, and MI llie

a doctor or even ,Olllcone to pick 
up phone. There are also sOl11e

there are , till things we've got to 
fix . ow that 's not heal!h care -
that' s the periphery. I don' t hear 
horror stories about the health care 
itself. 

pUCSD continues to have the 
image in the community of main· 
taining the standards of hea lth care 
in the community. A long as that 
persists, these other things will get 
fixed . If anythmg, I think we 've 
mad' thc quality of health carc 
more eflicicnt. We' re in the pro('.:~s 
of aggressively recruiting a c:hi cf 
executi ve oflicer to take care of the 
health care enterprises. Also impor· 
tantly, we need to get our faculty to 
what they' re upposed to be doing, 
which is the tcaching and research, 
not trying to run a business. 
What are your thoughts on the 
recent resignatIon of June 
Terpstra as the director of 
OffIce of Sexual Harassment 
Prevention " Policy? 

June was nOI especially happy 
in the way her job was structured 
and expressed it many times. She 
wanted broader authority and a 
different structure. Previous 
chancellors and I did nOI feel th at 
her [ideasJ were appropriate. She 
was very unhappy about lhat. She 
was a minority in her thinking. The 
current structure is not perfect. it ' 
far from perfect. I am having the 
structure looked at.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Ultimate 

The mention of ~uids to the 
average student al UCSD most 
likely conjures images of a picture 
from their favorite biology book. 
But mention Air Squids on cam-
pus and immediately, well maybe 
not immediately, pictures come to 
mind of high-Oying, fa st-paced 
ultimate di sc. 

On the first wcckend ofM arch, 
the Squids packed their bag~ and 
beaded to the Stanford In vite Ulti -
mate Tournament with two squads 
ready for battle. The A-team 
opened play with a pair of easy 
wins over UCSB's B squad and 
the University of Washington. 

Cycling 

Blistering temperature, soaring 
hills and stiff competition sum up the 
conditions Ihe UCSD cycling team 
experienced in San Luis Obispo this 
past weekend. Instead of the u ual 
two events, this raee featured three 
that added 10 Ihe exhaustion the team 
had to endure. Saturday morning, 
UCSD competed in the team timetrial 
(TfT), and in the afternoon faced the 
national-caliherroadcoursc. The road 
course featured 30 miles of hills and 
Oats, terrain that made for an exciting 
race. On Sunday. a few blocks were 
cleared in downtown San Luis Obispo 
to host the Crilerium. 

Men's Lacrosse 

The word "perseverance" per-
fectly desc ribes UCSD men' s 
lacrosse team last Sunday again t 

~ the Mira Costa Co l-• lege club team. After losing a heartbreaker on Wednesday 10 San 
Diego State University by 

a score of 8-4, and Ihen being 
blown out on Saturday by No. 2 
ranked Chapman College, 3 1·5, 
the UCSD men had taken enough 
abuse. 

After all was said and done. 
first-year coach Albert Man 's la· 
crosse team nailed down a vic-
tory , 10-8, giving him hi s first 
win as UCSD coach. 

an o lder, more experienced group 
of players. 

Falling behind early in the first 
half by fo ur goa ls, UCSD man· 
aged to ree l o ff fi ve in a row to 
enter halft ime with a score of 5· 
4. 

In the seco nd half, the tea m 
ti ghtened up it s defen 'e ho ld 
co nsiderabl y and allowed onl y 
four more goa ls. Starting goa l-
keeper Sri Seshag iri made some 
impress ive bl ocks, fini shing the 
day wi th onl y fi ve goal a l· 
lo wed. 

"We were down 4-0, but the 
team didn ' t lose hope," team cap-
tain Tim Leung said . "We kept 
our heads in the game and fought 
bac k hard. lt ' sj ust agreat fee ling 
to wi n." 

Next up for Squids was the 
host team from Stanford. In their 
tightest match of the weekend, the 
Squids were unable to hang on to 
an 8·7 lead and saw the ardinal 
steal the game, 13-9. 

In the past few weeks, UCSD's top 
riders have not competed. but on Sal-
urday, the cyclers displayed theirskills 
with the majority of the team compet-
ing. lnthe road race, the men's A leam 
couldn' t do much as a result of illness, 
injury and fatigue from the time lrial 
inthemoming. TheC teamkept UCSD 
close, however, as Chria Hazlil t 
proved his dominance of the category 
with a second place fini ~h , while Ben 
Bonnes grabbed third. In men '~ D 
division, only one rider, Dan Li ndell 
munagcd 10 score points wllh a six th 
place. 

Pedel: David Schurig head 
toward the fini s h thi s weekend . 

Although they were tired, sore 
and thoroughly di sappointed by 
their last two losses , nothing lifts 
playe rs' spirits like a vi ctory 
against a lOugh team. While Mira 
Costa is not quite at the same 
skill level as Ihc Chapman team, 
they are a team that supplements 
their line-up with experienced 
players. 

Frank Le mes scored three 
goa ls fo r UC D, along with two 
goa ls fro m teammate Eric Van 
Sluyters, and one goa l, three as-
sis ts fro m Evan Oldford. In the 

Having to fight out of Ihe B 
brackel fOllowing the loss to 
Stanford, the Squids picked up 
two more wins, including another 
dominate win over Wa~h i nglon . 

Chris Del Negro barely mi. !\Cd !irst 
place, andTom Toth outsprinted some 
Slanford cyclists forlhird place. In the 
men\ race, HaL.litl grabbed fourth, 
while Bonnes chugged in just behind 
him. 

, ga me aga inst Chapman, Frank 
Lcmes nell cd four goa ls, while 
Da n Cohan schooled the Panther 
defense for one goa l. 

The wins put Ihe Squids into 
Ihc finals against the ~quad from 
Iowa. Thc two tcam~ wcnl hack 
and forth Irading points, wilh nei-
ther squad lakin Ihe upper hand. 
With the game tied at 7-7, the 
Squids went on a 6·2 run and won 
t he game on an amazi ng catch by 
fi rs t year rlayer Jai me Town, who 
lellpt over Ihree Iowa defenders. 

The women foughl hard in Iheir 
race. Tammy Schaller look fourth 
place, Jenny Erlenmeyer ~printed for 
fi fth , and Francesca Nonnan and Sa· 
rah Hucheltook ninth and tenth. 

" Thi ~ is agreal place 10 race,"T()m 
Toth ~aid . "The ambiance i~ out of 
control. BUl lhere's ~ti ll nothing like a 
podium." 

Overall , UCSD pulled out a sixth 
place fin ish for the weekend in seeing 
jusl how well it can compete against 
the rest of the WCCe. 

These "ringers," as some like 
to ca ll thcm. include the coach 
for San Dieguito High Schoo l 
and other post-co llegia te play-
ers. 

Because Mira Costa is not pari 
of the Western Colleg iate La-
crosse League, they are not re· 
quired to play by the league's 
eli gibility rules. As a res ult ,

Eagles Plummit to Earth 
at Triton Baseball Stadium 
SPLIT: UCSD came back to win against Cal Baptist, 4-3 
By Travis HIli 
Staff Writer 

America' s pastime is in decline. Overtbe 
last few years, Major League Baseball has 
10 1 much of what once was the largest fan 

base in any sport. There arc 
many reasons why. The play· 
ers' strike is a big part of it, 
spira ling player salaries are 
another. But for the people 
trying to market baseball , the 
scariest reason is by far is the 
fact that it is just not as fas t 
paced as its counterparts, foot· 

ball and basketball . Many former fans say 
that there is just not enough action. 

That is one problem that the UCSD base-
ball team wi II never have. Spectators at the 
game should be warned that the game they 
are about to see is not for the faint of heart. 

The Tritons have seen everything from two-
out four-run rallies to a pinch hit, game-
winning homer. Triton Head Coach Robert 
Fletcher has a young, but tough-minded 
group this year that can best be described a 
"Cardiac Kids". Nearly every game the Tri -
tons have played this season hasn 't been 
decided until at least the seventh or eighth 
inning. At home la t Saturday, UCSD con-
tinued the Irend, scoring two in the bOl\om 
of the eighth in a eome-from-behind 4-3 
victory over California Baptist College. 

The Tritons de perately needed to win 
this game; coming into it they had a three-
game losing slreak, including a 12-7 loss 
Friday at UC Ri vcrs ide. The key wou Id be if 
starter John Wi Ili s cou Id have a good outing.

Triton Tennis Rolling 
BACK ON TRACK: The meri 's squad has turned it on lately, 
evidenced by its thumping of Claremont on Saturday 
By Nicole Vareas 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Don't call it a comeback, but Ihe young 
and inexperienced squad that began the 1997 
season with aO·3 record is now tearing through 

opponents like weathered vet-
erans and conquering any foe 
that sets foot on the MuirTen-
nis Courts. 

The Tritons are nursing a 
three-malch winnningstreak and 
playi ng confident tennis at home 
as they ncar Regionals and the 
National , which will be held in 

Virginia in May. UCSD conquered Claremont 
College last Saturday, 5·2, bringing its season 
record to an even 3-3 while keeping its eyes on 
the N AA Division ill postseason. 

"This was a good win for us," freshman 
Jason Hipp said. "Losing Ihis match could 
have hurt our draw for the Regional." 

Not only did the Tritons win the contest, 
but they earned the doubles point early in the 
match, before winning fouroftheir six singles 
mutches. This type of play was reminiscent of 
last year' s team, which defellted Claremont 
last year and faced them aga in late in the 
season in the Reg ionals. 

In double play, third-seeded pair Anthony 
Mcl icharck and Dave Murphy defeated thei r 
opponents early, 8-2. Unfonunatl y, the previ -
ously undefellledduoof Emil Mihet and Mike 
Rosell dropped their second-seed match, 8-6, 
and it was up to Steve Shabel and Ben Becker 
to pick up a win and seal the doubles point. 

With a defi eit of7-4, UCSD was in serious 
danger of dropping the match and giving the 
Stags the momentum into individual compe· 
tition, but the Shabel· Beeker tandem pulled 
through in the end with a 9-7 completion, and 
the incredible upset, 1-0. 

''They played a tough opponent," Hipp

said. ''They pl ayed hard though, and ca me 
back 10 close IClaremontj down," 

After douh les, the Tritons continued their 
ravag ing of Claremont with four solid wins. 

o. I Shabe l dropped John Han easily in two 
sets, 6-1 and 6· 1. Loggi ng upsets for UC D
