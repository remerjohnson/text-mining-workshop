... But Then They Got High

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN
Pot enthusiasts and hip-hop fanfare converged on Price Center to watch Afroman perform his cult favorite “Because I Got High” on March 4, as part of 
a Nooner concert sponsored by A.S. Programming. Festivals Coordinatior Garrett Berg said the mid-day event attracted approximately 1,000 students.

Ten of 13 Porter’s Pub employees threatened to walk out last week after the establishment’s new managers 
proposed major changes to its atmosphere, ultimately opting to stay after the managers changed their minds.

Porter’s Pub Dodges Drastic Changes 
Facing overwhelming 
employee opposition, 
new management agrees 
to forgo proposed 
establishment overhaul.
By Sonia Minden
Senior Staff Writer

Although a recent shift in 
Porter’s Pub ownership prompted 
swirling rumors that the tavern 
would be converted to a week-
end sports bar, these rumors have 
been quelled by both employees 
and former manager Robert Porter, 
who assure that the pub’s original 
integrity of the pub will remain 
intact — save a few requisite sur-
face renovations.

Porter reopened the UCSD 
tavern in his name as a graduate 
student in 1993 through a joint 
effort with the Graduate Student 
Association and A.S. Council. Since 
then, Porter’s Pub has been one 
of only three locations on campus 
licensed to serve alcohol and hosts 
university-run events and concerts 
on its patio and stage areas year-
round. 

However, in its 2006 three-year 
lease renewal, the pub met demands 
from university administrators to 
remodel outdated kitchen facilities 
and other offensive exterior viola-
tions, or risk being replaced by an 
outside venue. The administration 
estimated the renovations to cost 
nearly $100,000.

Lacking the financial means to 
pay for administrators’ requests 
and facing potential eviction, 

Price Center 
Fee Refund
on Horizon

While the Price Center expan-
sion continues into Spring Quarter, 
the university may soon return as 
much as $500,000 in student activity 
fees as a result of the project’s pres-
ent incompletion.

At the beginning of this quar-
ter, all UCSD students paid $39 to 
fund the construction and main-
tenance of the upgraded facili-
ties, which include Price Center 
and Student Center. However, 
the Student Initiated University 
Centers Expansion and Renovation 
Fee Referendum, passed in Spring 
Quarter 2003, mandated that the 
fee would not be collected “until the 
facilities are completed and open to 
students.”

In response to this apparent dis-
crepancy, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue announced last 
week that she would seek a refund 
in the amount of $26.52 per student, 
the amount allocated toward Price 
Center’s operations.

Dwindling Support Forces 
Campus to Court Young Alums

By Teresa Wu
Senior Staff Writer

Alumni donations to universi-
ties nationwide continued to decline 
last year, raising concerns about the 
diminishing role of contributions 
and prompting UCSD to utilize 
new programs to increase voluntary 
funding.

According to a Feb. 20 report 
released by the Council for Aid to 
Education, overall donations to 
American colleges increased by 6.3 
percent while alumni support also 
declined by 1.5 percent.

Experts suggest that the decrease 
in donations from alumni can be 
partially attributed to changes in 

demographics. 
“One of the big factors is the num-

ber of alumni that universities list as 
alumni,” Council for Advancement 
and Support of Education President 
John Lippincott said. “If you have 
more alumni on record but the same 
number giving, the participation 
rate actually goes down.”

More students are graduating 
from college each year, and univer-
sities are concurrently doing a better 
job of capturing graduates in their 
databases, which could explain last 
year’s decline in the participation 
rate. While the number of donating 
alumni increased by 2 percent, the 
number of alumni recorded in data-
bases increased by 4 percent. 

Additionally, since colleges have 
experienced a significant increase in 
enrollment over the last 10 years, the 
overall alumni base is younger than it 
has been in the past. 

“Our UCSD alumni are extremely

Restructure 
Festival’s

Entry Process
By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

This year’s Sun God Festival will 
employ a new procedure for admis-
sion, swapping last year’s electronic 
identification system for wristbands 
and handstamps. A.S. Programming 
officials said that the new process 
streamlines entrance to the nighttime 
concert and allows re-entry for the first 
time in the event’s history.

Programmers’ new festival design 
is composed of “five pillars of Sun 
God,” according to A.S. Associate 
Vice President of Programming Kevin 
Highland. The pillars represent a num-
ber of thematically organized activities, 
all located on RIMAC Field and oper-
ated throughout the day. One such site, 
tentatively dubbed by programmers as 
“Sun God Avenue,” will feature a street 
fair venue along Hopkins Drive. By 
utilizing Hopkins Drive and opening 
an entrance to the festival through the 
Hopkins Parking Structure, program-
mers are trying to shift heavy amounts 
of activity that have traditionally filled 
the campus’ Ridge Walk.

“[Ridge Walk] was never meant to 
handle what happens during Sun God,”

AFSCME Pickets on Campus 

for Wages, Benefits
Members of the American 

Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Local 3299 
picketed outside UCSD’s Thornton 
and Hillcrest hospitals on Feb. 28 to 
voice their concerns with inadequate 
wages, high-stress working condi-
tions and a rising cost of benefits that 
they say have negatively impacted 
the quality of patient care.

The union represents over 20,000 
health care and service workers at 
UC’s five medical centers and 10 
campuses whose contracts have 
expired. These employees include 
health care providers and technicians, 
custodians, food service workers, bus 
drivers, groundskeepers and security 
officers.

Since August 2007, AFSCME 
has emphasized that below-market 
wages, expensive benefits and the 
failure to implement a step system for 
wage increases have created issues 
with recruitment and retention prob-
lems and a less-experienced work-
force.

with live orchestral accompaniment to 
René Clair’s “Entr’acte” (1924) and 
Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí’s “Un

“Entr’acte” represents a Dadaist

Erosion Forces UCSD to Relocate Fishery
By Christina Homer
Senior Staff Writer

The Southwest Fisheries Science 
Center, currently located on land 
leased from UCSD near Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, will 
be moved to a new location by 2011 
due to the hazardous levels of ero-
sion observed in the cliffs beneath 
the center’s main facilities. 

Over the summer, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s research center in 
La Jolla will be partially evacuated 
because the foundations of two of 
the buildings have been deemed 
unsafely close to the cliff ’s edge for 
safety. Employees will be moving 
to temporary offices elsewhere on 
UCSD’s campus.

Meanwhile, plans are underway 
to build a new research center on the 
east side of La Jolla Shores Drive, a 
significant distance from the cliffs.

“We hope the transition will 
be quite smooth,” said Meghan 
Donahue, director of planning oper-
ations, management and informa-
tion for the center. 

According to Donahue, two-
thirds of the staff will move to tem-
porary leased space on Torrey Pines 
Road. The remaining staff will stay 
in the two buildings on the original 
site deemed safe for occupancy.

The new center is slated for com-
pletion by 2011 and is estimated to 
cost as much as $104 million. 

This year’s annual federal bud-
get proposal includes President 
George W. Bush’s $12.1-million 
request to help with the project’s 
costs. Donahue said that additional 
increases in federal contributions 
will be requested on an annual 
basis.

SFSC is working with the com-
munity to integrate the new center 
into the neighborhood.

“We’ve had one public scoping 
meeting here at the lab and we also 
attended and provided some infor-
mation at two La Jolla community 
planning meetings,” Donahue said.

Among the issues raised by com-
munity members are concerns that 
the new center will block views and 
generate parking congestion. Right 
now, most of the staff at the SFSC are 

forced to park on the street due to  
limited parking at the current cen-
ter.  However, Donahue said that the 
new center will include 202 parking 
spaces below the building.    

 The planning team is trying to 
minimize the impact on neighbor-
hood viewpoints by painting the 
roofs green to match the landscape. 
In addition, it will continue to host 
forums for community members to 
voice concerns.

Donahue said that other than the 
time during which the offices will be 
moved, the center’s research should 
not be significantly interrupted. 

The La Jolla laboratory is the 
headquarters for the NOAA’s 
National Marine Fisheries Service 
and also houses units focused on 
Antarctic ecosystems research, 
research on fisheries resources and 
research on protected resources.  
The center’s scientists also study 
Pacific and Antarctic fish, marine 
mammals, sea turtles and marine 
habitats.

Council Sidesteps Allegations of 
Double-Dipping, Senator Snuggling

Debate returned with a ven-geance at last night’s meeting as councilmembers argued 
about how to hold senators account-
able and the perils of doling out A.S. 
funds to the same student organiza-
tion twice.

Discord first struck when the 
Committee on Rules and Contracts 
proposed an amendment to the 
standing rules to create a new pro-
cedure, complete with audits, to deal 
with senators with poor attendance 
records.

“I think, if it’s come to this, there’s 
a worse problem,” said Thurgood 
Marshall College 
Chair Lana Blank. 
“We shouldn’t be 
policing ourselves 
and chasing each 
other with atten-
dance [records].”

M a r s h a l l 
Senator Kyle 
Samia echoed 
Blank’s dissatisfaction with the pro-
posed solution. “For whatever reason, 
people don’t show up to shit. That’s a 
structural problem,” he said, suggest-
ing that some senators may be shirk-
ing council participation because they 
occupy mostly titular positions.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Neetu Balram endorsed 
the proposal because it would allow 
a group of people to “legitimately 
approach” a senator about account-
ability concerns, as opposed to the 
less formal procedure currently in 
place. 

The emerging consensus, how-
ever, was that the proposal needed 
some rewording before it could be 
seriously considered.

To that end, Tanya 
Piyaratanaphipat moved to table the 
bill for a week so that it could be 
revisited at the next meeting.

The next disagreement arose 
when the council considered fund-
ing requests. Earl Warren College 
Senator Peter Benesch objected to a 
finance bill that would fund a spo-
ken-word event jointly hosted by 
the Muslim Student Association and 

Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlan. Benesch contended that MSA 
and MEChA were not entitled to 
additional funding since they both 
had already been awarded money as 
part of quarterly student organization 
allocations.

All-Campus Senator Naasir 
Lakhani sponsored the MSA-MEChA 
bill as part of his senator project to 
bring Amir Solaiman (of HBO’s Def 
Poetry Jam) to UCSD, among other 
spoken-word artists.

“This is going to be one of the 
most amazing events at UCSD this 
year … I know it will be seen as 

double-dipping, 
but this event is 
unprecedented,” 
Lakhani said.

Benesch cau-
tioned that pass-
ing the bill would 
set a precedent 
that allows stu-
dent organizations 

to secure funding in addition to quar-
terly allocations by cozying up to 
senators.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Andrew Guichet 
expanded on Benesch’s objection. “I 
just don’t think we should get on 
the path of student organizations to 
lobby senators to get extra funds … 
That shouldn’t be a means of getting 
funds from A.S. [Council],” he said.

The council ultimately agreed to 
use some creative financing to make 
an exception.

To his credit, and after weathering 
a procedural nightmare, Benesch was 
able to broker a solution by augment-
ing MEChA’s previously approved 
quarterly allocation as necessary, so 
that the extra finance bill could be 
withdrawn. 

The appearance of double-dipping 
was eliminated, although the question 
of senator project funds overlapping 
with student organization allocations 
was unresolved.

As with the proposed account-
ability reform, the council agreed to 
revisit the ethics issue at a later meet-
ing.

Festivals Coordinator Garrett Berg 
said. “There are throngs of people and 
lots of things going [on] in this one nar-
row walkway. [Hopkins] is well-suited 
for more activity, and, with planning, 
should offer an atmosphere that’s less 
cramped than in previous years.”

The festival’s entrance operations 
came under criticism last year when 
malfunctioning ID-scanning sys-
tems left crowds of rowdy students 
at gateways. The programmers’ new 
approach is simplified, Highland said, 
and only requires that attendees show a 
wristband and photo ID to enter.

Wristbands will be available May 
12 through May 15, and none will be 
offered on the day of the festival. Berg 
said that 5,000 guest wristbands would 
be available for purchase for students’ 
guests, alumni, staff and faculty. The 

Programmers Redirect Activity to Hopkins
▶ FESTIVAL, from page 1 number of guest wristbands matches 

last year’s number of guest tickets. Berg 
also said although programmers are 
restricting wristband sales on the day 
of the concert, they hope that expan-
sion of publicity will familiarize stu-
dents with the new procedure.

“We’re having locations at every 
college where you can get and buy 
wristbands,” he said. “With all of those 
locations in addition to a central site, 
everyone should have ample opportu-
nities to get admission.”

This year’s Sun God Festival, to 
be hosted May 16, will center activity 
on RIMAC Field, which will host a 
DJ-manned dance, LCD monitors dis-
playing student artwork and films and 
local bands at different times through-
out the day. The additional activities 
promote community-building “per-
sona” for Sun God, Berg said. Safety 

became an issue after last year’s festi-
val, when the number of event-related 
arrests and citations rose; almost half 
of those were linked to nonaffiliates. 
The missteps prompted programmers 
to commission the Sun God Planning 
Report to assess festival operations 
and comments from administrative 
departments about the impacts of the 
festival on the campus. Administrators 
highlighted safety issues and the need 
to encourage community bonding.

“The overarching goal for the fes-
tival is to create an event that builds 
community and affiliation and main-
tains an environment that is safe and 
protects the health and welfare of all 
participants,” Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff said.

along in our construction process 
by now, but construction does not 
always go as planned,” she said.

Rue said the refund process 
requires approval from the UC Office 
of the President and is ongoing.

The matter was initially brought 
to Rue’s attention by Registration 
Fee Advisory Committee Chair Garo 
Bournoutian, who helped draft the 
original referendum.

“I did remember seeing an e-mail 
for the grand opening coming in 
April, and I knew the actual opening 
of the building and its occupancy 
was late March,” Bournoutian said. 
“I knew it was coming up, but real-
ized it wasn’t the quarter initially 
planned, because it was initially 
planned in the winter.” 

The referendum originally 
split the cost into two sections: a 
University Centers fee and a fee spe-
cific to Price Center. The University 
Centers fee was charged during Fall 
and Winter Quarters, which covered 
the operations and maintenance of 
the Student Center project, accord-
ing to University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair Matthew Bright.

Bournoutian contacted Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Edward Spriggs about the discrep-
ancy, who agreed after a walk-
through that Price Center was not 
yet ready for student use. Spriggs 
then presented the issue to Rue.

According to University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino, administra-
tors chose to assess the fee during 
the middle of Fall Quarter, based on 
information provided to them by the 
construction contrator. Rue said the 
payment was collected before the start 

of the quarter in order to cover neces-
sary expansion-related expenses.

The activity fee reimbursements 
would add up to about $500,000, 
Rue said, which she believes may 
adversely impact construction on a 
temporary basis.

“It’s probably going to make it a 
little difficult to manage the operating 
expenses in the short run,” she said.

If the reimbursement occurs, it will 
not affect the construction schedule, 

Terzino said.
Bournoutian said the premature 

fee assessment highlights the need 
for a student committee that man-
ages and scrutinizes activity fees, 
many of which take effect long after 
the students who passed the mea-
sures leave UCSD.

“We need a concerned student 
group that can keep track of more 
long-term fee issues,” he said. “It’s 
kind of difficult for most people to 
look at fees on a historical basis. It’s 
hard to say, ‘This was written in 1986 
with the following stipulations; are 
these stipulations being upheld?’”

young and not financially capable 
of giving large, significant gifts,” 
UCSD Director of Development 
Communications Judy Piercey said 
in an e-mail. “That demographic is 
not projected to change for the next 
10 years.”

UCSD Executive Director of 
Individual Giving Harrie M. Hughes 
said that the challenge is to engage 
younger alumni philanthropically so 
that they donate at whatever amount 
they can afford, but just as important-
ly, continue to do so year after year.

Last summer, UCSD’s seven-
year fundraising campaign, titled 
“The Campaign for UCSD: Imagine 
What’s Next,” achieved its goal of 
bringing in more than $1 billion.  

With the campaign concluded, 
UCSD is focusing on creating a 
culture of philanthropy among 
both current students and its young 
alumni base. 

“UC San Diego has launched a 
new website that has a robust online 
giving aspect,” Hughes said. “[We] 
are seeing quite a significant spike 
in gifts being made online.” 

Since September 2005, over 5,745 
donors have contributed nearly $1.8 
million through the online giving 
site, www.givetoucsd.ucsd.edu. 

“Online giving has been growing 
substantially but still represents a very 
small percentage,” Lippincott said. “I 
suspect over time it will become a very 
substantial portion of giving, particu-
larly as the younger generation, who 
are used to giving transactions online, 
decide that’s the way they want to do 
their charitable giving.” 

Lippincott added that universi-
ties are also using online commu-
nities as a means to engage young 
alumni early on and keep them 
involved so that when asked, they 
are more inclined to donate.

In addition, this is the second 
straight year that UCSD has solic-
ited seniors using Facebook. 

“We’re using Facebook to go 
through to students and young 
alumni,” Interim Executive Director 
of Alumni Relations Armin Afsahi 

said. “We’re using it as a mechanism 
to educate, inspire, and direct them 
to our giving sites.” 

Results of the CAE report do 
not indicate links between shrink-
ing donation levels and the recent 
economic downturn, since the sur-
vey results were based on dona-
tions given up until June 2007, said 
Lippincott. 

However, he noted that in weak 
economic times, donations level off 
but typically do not decline sub-
stantially. 

As state funding declines, univer-
sities are depending more than ever 
on their own fundraising efforts. At 
UCSD, only 12 percent of the cur-
rent budget comes from state rev-
enue. Donations therefore represent 
a significant source of income that 
helps fund student scholarships and 
fellowships, faculty research, aca-
demic programs and new campus 
buildings.

Programs such as the Student 
Foundation’s “I-Pledge” for current 
students, the Chancellor’s Associates 
Young Alumni donor group, and 
UCSD Near You alumni events all 
build on the messages that showcase 
campus alumni contributions. 

“We would like to inspire indi-
viduals to really think about giving 
back — that giving is both to UCSD, 
but also through UCSD, to the areas 
they are most passionate about,” 
Afsahi said. 

Alumni giving across the UC 
system increased 120.2 percent over 
the past 10 years but decreased 
1.8 percent in the past two years, 
according to Piercey.  

The national percentage of alum-
ni making donations also declined 
from 11.9 to 11.7 percent.

Campus Continues to Tap

Chair: Campus Needs Long-Term Fee Oversight
▶ FEES, from page 1 Though there are many com-

mittees on campus that oversee the 
implementation of student fees, 
such as UCAB and the Athletics, 
Recreation and Sports Facilities 
Advisory Board, Bournoutian said 
they are often geared toward more 
current or specialized topics.

“Having a group of students who 
are interested in maintaining a con-
tinuity of information and account-
ability with regard to UCSD’s vari-
ous student-funded facility projects 
would be ideal,” he said.

To facilitate students’ knowledge 
of how much they are paying and 
to whom, A.S. Biological Sciences 
Senator Emma Sandoe designed 
handouts to distribute across cam-
pus that provide a detailed break-
down of all of the fees charged by 
the university. Sandoe, who gath-
ered the information for an ongoing 
senator project, said she hopes this 
will increase billing transparency 
and make students more active par-
ticipants in the process.

However, Rue said that even with-
out the assistance of RFAC, adminis-
trators would have noticed and dealt 
with the reimbursement issue.

“We had a watchful eye on this,” 
she said. “We would have come to 
the same decision.”

Rue said she hopes that the reim-
bursements will appear as a credit 
on students’ Spring Quarter bills.

The new Price Center is expect-
ed to open at the beginning of next 
quarter, and a grand-opening cel-
ebration is scheduled for April 25, 
Terzino said.

THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  13

Porter sought out personal friends Stephen 
Lawler and Moses Muñoz — proprietors 
of mortgage investment company Labrador 
Enterprises — to discuss the possibility of 
buying Porter’s Pub as a last attempt to keep 
it afloat.

Over the following year, Lawler and 
Muñoz agreed that the student-minded tav-
ern was a lucrative enterprise. Then, on Feb. 
15, Porter’s Pub fell under sole ownership of 
Labrador Enterprises.

“Stephen and Moses have been coming 
by the pub to observe and get a feel for the 
place over the last year or so,” Porter said in 
an e-mail. “Frankly, if they didn’t view it as a 
special kind of place, they wouldn’t have seen 
the value in committing to invest in the place 
the way they have.” 

But the managerial transition was not a 
smooth one. Employees disagreed with many 
of the changes that Lawler 
and Muñoz had in mind. 
The new owners believed 
the pub could be made 
more profitable by show-
casing sports events, open-
ing the business on week-
ends for longer hours, and 
hiring nonstudent, profes-
sional bartenders. 

“They originally wanted 
to fire all the students and 
bring in outside workers,” 
John Muir College alumnus 
and Porter’s Pub employ-
ee Steve York said. “They 
wanted to come in, buy Porter’s out and 
change the place. The first day they got here, 
they walked over to the TV, turned on the 
Lakers game, and started playing gangster 
rap.” 

Furthermore, the new managers allegedly 
proposed omitting all traditional discounts 
such as “Dollar-Off Mondays” for GSA meet-
ings, and discouraged employees from giving 
special consideration to clubs or friends. 

The new owners ignited considerable 
employee backlash, and 10 of 13 employees 
threatened to quit within the first week of 
Lawler and Muñoz’s arrival. On Feb. 23, they 
delivered a petition to Lawler that stated 
their contentions with the new changes. Muir 
senior and Porter’s Pub employee Tyler Kraus 
largely orchestrated the movement, saying he 
was spurred by the pub’s core ideals.

“I was not about the let [the new manag-
ers] spit in the face of Porter’s Pub, or turn it 
into a bastardized facsimile,” Kraus said. “It 
will remain as it has for 15 years.”

Porter’s 1993 proposal to administra-
tors premised the enterprise on a positive 
working environment, stating that a strong 
employee-manager relationship is “the first 
step to a friendly atmosphere for customers. 

Worker’s input … will be sought after and 
considered.” 

This guiding philosophy, along with the 
signed petition, convinced Lawler to extin-
guish many of his controversial changes and 
reach a compromise.

“When Stephen realized that over 75 per-
cent of the employees didn’t want to work [at 
Porter’s], it kind of blew his mind,” York said. 
“He apologized and said that it would be 
harder to start from scratch than transition-
ing and renovating.” 

The management then held a meeting 
with Porter and staff members to issue both 
a verbal and written apology and to discuss 
future plans for renovation. 

While the new lease is still in escrow, the 
details for structural expansion, new menu 
items and updated facilities are currently 
being dicussion.

“Porter’s Pub is going to be what Rob 
Porter always wanted, but 
never had the initial capi-
tal for,” Kraus said. “It’ll 
have giant community 
benches, like Pizza Port 
in Solana Beach. Big-
screen TVs will play surf 
videos and the Discovery 
Channel — it won’t be a 
sports bar.”

The new lease also 
guarantees 12 nights out 
of the month for inde-
pendently hosted parties 
and for student clubs and 
organizations to hold 

events at the Porter’s stage. Staff members 
hope these events will attract a broader and 
more diverse customer base. 

Additionally, a full kitchen is purportedly 
scheduled for expansion over the summer 
— one of the administration’s requirements 
in the updated lease agreement.

“There will be new grill tops for every-
thing from burgers to Philly cheese steaks, 
and other extended menu items,” Kraus said. 
“We’ll have hired cooks outside the student 
body.”

Ultimately, the new management and staff 
at Porter’s will aim to preserve the qualities 
that have established it as a celebrated and 
historic social setting at UCSD.

“I’ve been a bartender in L.A. and am an 
avid beer drinker; there isn’t anywhere that 
has what Porter’s has,” Earl Warren College 
senior and regular Porter’s customer Kris 
Gregorian said. “I love all kinds of beer, but 
mainly the good kind — and, Porters has 
that. … I feel like the old Student Center 
embodies what I, and a lot of other people, 
imagined college to be like.”

EDITORIALS

In perhaps the largest student-interest story of this year, A.S. programmers recently present-
ed their newly hatched plan that 
completely redesigns the Sun God 
Festival. The “five pillars of Sun God” 
are thematically programmed around 
five new locations on RIMAC Field, 
including a Triton Avenue of ven-
dors and booths and carnival-style 
games, complete with a Ferris wheel 
(consider this the official call for 
Astrojumps).

Naysayers are partially correct. It 
is easy to see the effort as hammed 
up and hokey, a half-hearted attempt 
to meet demands that the Sun God 
Festival acquire a safer “community-
building” character. But to be fair, 
the festival has never had a character 
or spirit about it, only representing 
a singular day of let-loose, balls-out 
flavor. We have all bonded over Sun 
God, but that bond has never been 
explicitly defined or fleshed out.

Credit is due to A.S. program-
mers for being the first to stab at 
that definition, especially consider-
ing the cauldron of scandal they were 
boiling in earlier this year. The Sun 
God Planning Report nearly damned 
the festival’s reputation with anec-
dotal and statistical revelations about 
arrests, citations and unruly crowds 
at poorly managed entrances. It was 
input and communication from sev-
eral committee meetings that yielded 

positive results, and A.S. Associate 
Vice President of Programming 
Kevin Highland says that the new 
plan is meshing well with adminis-
trators.

But now, the programmers have 
one last hurdle: convincing students. 
The key to a successful event this 
year is proper publication of the 
completely redone procedures and 
educating students about them. It 
is vital that students aren’t jarred 
by the transitions. Foreseeable pit-
falls are easy to find: Programmers’ 
decision to restrict day-of wristband 
sales could severely poison students’ 
experiences. Allowing only four days 
to obtain wristbands, or buy them for 
guests, will undoubtedly stir panic-
stricken crowds. A smooth transition 
hinges both on programmers’ efforts 
to communicate and students’ efforts 
to listen.

Still, the re-engineered festival is 
certainly enticing for its sheer cura-
torial vision. It brings into the fold 
a swath of campus entities but, most 
importantly, it showcases a student-
led atmosphere, one that program-
mers have finally been able to identi-
fy and codify. Student artwork, films 
and performances can now have their 
piece of Sun God within the Midway, 
just as young local talent do at the 
North Stage.

Programmers are still keeping 
their door open to modifications and 

said that they will continue commit-
tee and debriefing meetings follow-
ing the May 16 festival. But a sturdy 
skeleton has been formed. Barring a 
complete unraveling of festival plans, 
students will be able to enjoy a more 
lively, vibrant and dynamic festival.

Time will tell Sun God’s future. 
Too hokey? Get rid of the carni-
val motif. Too hard to get tickets? 
Extend the days they are distributed. 
Complaints will be commonplace, 
but programmers this year have illus-
trated a newfound connectivity with  
their audience. Let this year’s Sun 
God be our chance to herald its sec-
ond coming, and use it to mold all of 
the festivals to follow.

As the Thurgood Marshall College community waits to see whether the Dimensions 
of Culture writing sequence will 
receive a procedural facelift, D.O.C. 
Director Abraham Shragge contin-
ues to occupy a rather precarious 
position.

Following committee report 
that reviewed curriculum late last 
month, and sided with longtime 
critics who argued that the courses 
have been “watered down” in recent 
years, Shragge must now decide 
whether to endorse the committee’s 
recommendations and advocate the 
proposed structural changes, or 
continue to stubbornly deny that 
D.O.C. is at a crossroads.

While this board is hoping for 
the former, it is resigned to antici-
pate the latter.

Shragge, who has shown little 
responsiveness to criticisms of the 
program over the past year, seems 
unreasonably resistant to any major 
structural or curricular changes. He 
demonstrated this by not rehir-
ing teaching assistants Benjamin 

Balthaser and Scott Boehm last 
year, despite the pair’s high student 
evaluations and obvious commit-
ment to the sequence’s core ideol-
ogy. 

He demonstrated this by repeat-
edly denying that the program 
had strayed from the ideals that 
inspired its 1990 inception, though 
many professors and students — 
purported to be the heart and soul 
of the D.O.C. program — did not 
agree. 

And finally, he demonstrated 
this reluctance by not immediately 
committing to follow through on 
the report’s recommendations, say-
ing only that he was planning dis-
cussions with community members 
to examine their options in choos-
ing the course’s future.

While the decision will thank-
fully fall to a steering committee 
and not Shragge himself, his actions 
over the next few months will 
directly affect the college’s cohesion 
and the message that the program is 
trying to disseminate to students. 

History professor and review 

committee member David 
Gutierrez was correct when he said 
that D.O.C. needs more than just a 
commitment of material resources, 
such as enhanced training for TAs 
and hiring of ladder-rank faculty 
members.

In order for D.O.C. to change, it 
needs an ideological commitment 
from its leaders and not empty lip 

service.
Given his record so far, it’s hard to 

visualize Shragge changing his tune 
and actually granting the report’s 
findings the weight they deserve. 
However, in the interest of Marshall 
students, one can only hope that the 
advisory board’s members will be 
treated as informed observers and 
not tokenistic figureheads.

THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 2008

As Winter Quarter draws to a close and the inevitable hell known as finals week comes 
upon us, it is easy to hole up in our 
rooms and forget about the outside 
world. I have to admit that when 
final exams roll around, I become a 

complete shrew, speaking to nobody 
and having only the companionship 
of a history book to keep me warm 
on those cold 10th week nights. 
However, I know that free time is 
always at a premium around finals 
week, so I have decided to come up 
with a plan that will allow me to inte-
grate global and political awareness 
into my end-of-the-quarter rhythm. 

These are just a few simple ways 
that mundane studying and exam 
preparation can also serve to keep you 
on top of current events. Integrating 
some basic techniques into your 
study habits will keep you connected 
to global phenomena, while giving 
your tired brain a much-needed 
break from concentrating nonstop 
on molecular biology and classical 
Greek, or from stressing out about 
the fact that your Monster energy 
drink stash is running low. These 
three time-tested methods will help 
you survive finals week while giving 
you the gratitude of knowing that 
you aced your tests as an informed, 
productive member of society.

Key Letter Association
Depending on what subject you 

are studying, choose a key term or 
phrase that you can connect to some-
thing political of your choice. For 
example, if you’re studying chem-
istry, every time you see the term 
“base polymer” think of Barack’s 
platform. You don’t have to take 
time to research his stances at that 
very moment, but just think about 
one thing that he advocates and 
explain to yourself why or why not 
you agree. 

This periodic internal political 
discussion will force you to think 
more about the upcoming elections 

Props to Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue for recommending that students 
be reimbursed for fees charged before the 
Price Center expansion’s opening.

Shragge’s Obstinance Leaves Students Asking, What’s Up D.O.C.?

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— Last week, the UC system filed 
a charge against the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees claiming that 
the union was guilty of unfair labor 
practices. AFSCME members had 
been distributing leaflets on the UC 
San Francisco campus to gather soli-
darity and support for ongoing con-
tract negotiations, but not to disrupt 
the flow of the school’s medical center, 
as the university alleged. 

The recent incident highlights the 
plight of union rights and of free 
speech, with each incident illustrating 
the far extent to which the university 
is willing to go to deny both.

AFSCME represents over 11,000 

patient care technical workers (lab 
assistants, nurses’ aides, etc.) and 
around 7,000 service workers (custo-
dians) from throughout the 10-cam-
pus UC system. These people are 
the university’s backbone, yet their 
work is so underappreciated that their 
requests for salary increases and a 
contract that guarantees wages adjust-
ed to cost-of-living increases are con-
sistently denied. 

AFSCME is also determined to 
have its demands for health care and 
retirement benefits and expenses met. 
In rejecting the union’s proposed $16-
million wage increase for the almost 
20,000 workers, the university claimed 
that such an increase would raise the 
average pay rate to $20.75 an hour. 

This is simply not true.
According to Lakesha Harrison, 

president of AFSCME Local 3299, the 

university’s claim is a blatant exag-
geration based on statistics that pur-
posefully distort its data. Harrison 

said the numbers used to produce the 
false pay rate of $20.75 include non-
unionized nurses whose $40 hourly 
rates manipulated the UC system’s 
projections. By resorting to number 
tampering, the university has demon-

strated that it cannot defend its stance 
with the actual numbers, a sign that 
the existing numbers must surely be 
in the union’s favor.

Aside from the mere decimals and 
dollar signs being tossed around by 
the university and AFSCME, the for-
mer has denied the latter. The UC sys-
tem prides itself on being one of the 
most respected public systems in the 
nation, yet the university has given 
the union and its members a big, fat, 
proverbial slap in the face. Especially 
at UCSD, where the medical school 
is highly rated and produces award-
winning breakthroughs, patient care 
technician workers are crucial to any 
success that the university has. 

Existing wages at UC medical cen-
ters are disturbingly low, as much as 
25 percent below the market average, 
according to AFSCME representa-

tives. 
In a society where private 

health care providers such as Kaiser 
Permanente, Blue Shield and HMOs 
have come to be dominant, the state-
funded UC medical centers have 
experienced elevated turnover rates, 
with many employees leaving to find 
work in the higher-paying private sec-
tor. Unless UC negotiators yield to 
even the most meager of AFSCME’s 
contract requests, a critical compo-
nent of their prestigious medical sys-
tem will slowly disintegrate. 

Along with clamping down on 
union rights and ignoring the well-
being of honest, hardworking union 
members, the university has shown 
complete disregard for the constitu-
tional right of free speech by filing an 

UC System Continues to Kick Union Workers While They’re Down 

See AFSCME, page 5

“The university has given the union and its members a big, fat, proverbial slap in 
the face.”

Flops to Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, 
Oregon and Vermont for spending more of 
their state budgets on prisons than higher 

education in 2007.

Carbon Tax a Possible 
Solution for Tight Budget? 

Dear Editor,
As a fellow University of California 

student in Santa Barbara, I am writ-
ing to express my concern about the 
looming budget cuts. Here at UCSB, 
we are already seeing the effects of 
the cuts with proposed fee increases 
and cutbacks in student employees. 
I am sure the situation is similar in 
San Diego. Until the major deficits in 
the state budget can be recovered, the 
cuts will continue. Because education 
is not the top priority for our state 
legislators right now, we need to take 
it into our own hands to ensure that 
our educational quality and oppor-
tunities do not evaporate. If we do 
not take action ourselves as students, 
who will?

Solving the state’s budget crisis 
may seem like a daunting task, but 
there is something we can do about it. 
A simple solution such as a carbon tax 
would have many associated benefits. 
A tax of just a few dollars per barrel of 
oil could generate substantial revenue 
for the state, alleviating a significant 
proportion of the deficit. The price at 
the pump would go up a few cents, but 
that is nothing compared to the extra 
couple hundred dollars you would 
owe the University of California every 
quarter. 

The impact would be felt the great-
est by large corporations that use large 

quantities of oil, pushing them to 
invest in alternative energy sources. 
This will have obvious benefits in 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and reducing our dependence on for-
eign oil.

It is time for us to get involved 
so that our state deficits do not bur-
den us now as students, or in the 
future as taxpayers. Start discussions 
about a carbon tax with your relatives 
and friends, pointing out that the tax 
could actually benefit them in the 
future. Organize in student groups 
to get your voice heard. It is time for 
our generation to step up and express 
what is important to us.

and give you a break before tackling 
your next chapter on the magnetic 
resonance of spectroscopy. If science 
isn’t your thing, how about “mar-
ginal product” for mass poverty, 
or “tonal harmony” for totalitarian 
hegemony?

History Lesson at CLICS
With only one UCSD library 

open 24 hours a day during finals 
week, students often gravitate toward 
CLICS for round-the-clock study-
ing, even if it is noisier and more 
social than Geisel. What most of the 
CLICS patrons don’t realize, how-
ever, is that their cherished library 
stands directly above one of the most 
historically and politically important 
sites on campus: Revelle Plaza. On 
May 11, 1970, a 23-year-old gradu-
ate student named George Winne 
Jr. set himself on fire in the middle 
of the plaza and died in protest of 
the Vietnam War. The memory of 

Winne’s actions should never be for-
gotten. Think about what it took for 
a student to end his own life in hopes 
of bringing the war to an end. 

Don’t just scuttle quickly past 
Revelle Plaza hoping to cram in as 
much study time as possible but 
instead use your 10-second walk 
over the plaza to understand that 
there is still a war going on today for 
the same reasons that caused Winne 
to light the match.

Group Study
If you follow my previous sugges-

tion, you will be even more in need 
of social interaction and cheering 
up. What better way to do this than 
to study in groups? I know that as 
UCSD students we feel like we’re 
smarter than the guy next to us, so 
studying with him is only going to 
bring us down. Not true. 

Studying in groups allows us to 
learn new things that our other-
wise egotistical minds would have 

forgotten, and talking out ideas is a 
great way to review. Also, teaching 
a subject to a peer is probably the 
best way to cement it into your own 
mind. This will also give you the sat-
isfaction of knowing that you’ve got 
your material down stat. 

Most importantly, though, is the 
fact that group studying stresses 
community building and interaction 
between people. I promise you that 
after a quality study session with a 
fun group of people you will walk 
away feeling physically revitalized 
and with a greater appreciation for 
the impact that other people can 
have in your life. 

So just remember that the begin-
ning of finals week doesn’t mean 
that the world at large stops. If you 
are bent on devoting a week of your 
life to nothing but school, then at 
least follow these fun and easy sug-
gestions that help to bring the real 
world into the little UCSD bubble 
that we love so much.

How to Change Your Life, One Study Group at a Time

unfair labor practice charge against 
AFSCME’s leafleting at UCSF. In a 
public space in front of medical centers 
on five UC campuses, union members 
handed out flyers and leaflets in a 
grassroots effort to inform passersby 
of the contract negotiations that have 
been dragging on since August 2007. 
AFSCME was trying to rally support 
for their desired wage increases, as 
engaging the public is a time-tested 
method for furthering a cause, yet the 
university has attempted to halt this 
peaceful method by saying that union 
members were harassing patients as 
they entered the buildings. 

AFSCME has not even started 
picketing in front of UC buildings 
(which might become a reality if the 

university continues its tight-fisted 
ways) and it is already being charged 
with unfair labor practices. Filing 
charges against the union for calmly 
bringing attention to its cause is com-
pletely unfounded and, in reality, the 
university should be reprimanded for 
its treatment of the First Amendment. 
Compromising the union’s free speech 
rights is a shallow attempt to keep 
AFSCME quiet and slow its progress 
by silencing its attempts at gaining 
public support.

The union members are not asking 
for anything that they do not deserve 
— if anything, they are actually asking 
for an amount lower than what their 
noble work should demand. However 
long UC administrators decide to 
stubbornly prolong negotiations is 

University Should Reward Dedicated AFSCME Workers
▶ AFSCME, from page 4 up to them. In the past week, UC-

AFSCME negotiations have moved to 
the mediation stage and now a state-
appointed mediator will attempt to 
resolve the issue. 

If the university truly cared about 
maintaining the working status of its 
campuses and upholding the human 
values that it claims to teach within its 
classrooms, then this stage of negotia-
tions would have never been reached. 
The importance of AFSCME’s work 
and the integrity of its members must 
be respected, a step that can only 
be reached if the university finally 
acquiesces to the modest demands of 
the workers.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

B ritish whorehouses, John Lennon cam-eos, royal orgies — has a heist flick ever held so much promise? “The Bank Job,” penned by sitcom scribes Dick Clement 
and Ian La Frenais, is an ambitious stab at crafting a 
movie for both the mid-20s AMC Everyman and those 
arthouse-goers craving cerebral stuff. Unfortunately, it 
stumbles somewhere into an unconvincing gray area, 
moving between sporadic splinters of violence and 
slow-moving plot clarifications.

Granted, the plot is challenging to begin with — it’s 
a loose take (we’re talking off-the-hinges loose) on 
the real life “walkie-talkie robbery,” a government-
concealed 1971 scandal involving amateur burglars 
who tunneled their way into the Central London 
Lloyd’s Bank and made off scot-free with a few million 
pounds. 

Such a golden nugget of untold history screams 
to be cinema-spun, and the screenwriters grab it 
and run, liberally infusing the tale with conceivable 
shockers as they go. The robbery is less about money 
swiping than a couple of compromising photos of an 
orgy-romping Princess Margaret. The snaps man-

age to fall into the hands of Michael X (Peter 
De Jersey), a disciple o f his American 

black-power counterpart. 
Charged with retrieving the x-rated shots, a govern-

ment spy cuts a deal with his modelesque girlfriend, 
Martine (the arresting, if not a tad impassive Saffron 
Barrows): rob the safe-deposit box, return the photos 
and keep the change. Problem is, she must find some-
one to play along without asking questions — and 
finds the perfect willing fool in her old flame, Terry 
(Jason Statham, familiar with the role of heist hero), 
a discontent car salesman with a family to feed. Along 
with mates Kevin (Stephen Campbell Moore) and 
ex-porn star Dave (the doe-eyed Daniel Mays), Terry 
agrees they’ve got nothing better going for them than 
to engage in some seemingly harmless criminal action. 
Plus, Martine is hot enough to convince pretty much 
anyone to rob a bank. 

If the film is largely dry of laugh-out-loud moments, 
its rare hysterics lie in the interactions between the 
unlikely band of robbers, trying to jackhammer their 
way under a Chicken Inn without seeming conspicu-
ous to greasy-fingered customers, who are stupefied 
the moment their fried wings start mysteriously quak-
ing. When the police begin to think something might 
be up, we wonder if the game is off — fortunately, the 
knock at the door is only an innocuous “chips” deliv-
ery from the Inn (oh, those charming Brits and their 

Winning this year’s Oscar for 
“Best Foreign Language Film,” 
Ruzowitzky’s work resembles a typical 

cable channel minise-
ries: artistically leavened but 
decidedly stale. 

Sorowitsch’s infamous criminal 
past is excavated by the Nazi government 
soon after Austria’s collapse and his own subse-
quent incarceration. Banding together upstanding 
financiers, radical political martyrs and printing-fac-
tory proletariats, the group’s collective endeavor provides 

the government with millions of counterfeit notes in exchange for rudimentary 
food, clothing, shelter and protection. Most of the film’s argumentative dialogue and 
episodic drama stem from the dynamic politics of these uniquely fortunate individuals, 
where Salomon learns his own survivalist philosophy mirrors that of the Nazi Captain Friedrich 
Herzog (Devid Striesow) — who professes he’s not a Nazi, but that he’s merely doing what he must in 
order to survive. 

The moral dilemma offered to each individual is shaped by distinct ideologies; notably, Social Darwinism 

british heist flick spins a tall tale tan gled with whores, hedonism and bloody violence — 
                            and mostly manages not to trip.

The daring acts of bravery and endurance in many concentration camps are brusque vignettes too short to fill an entire film; stealing a bar of soap or half-eaten apple often ends with the abrupt bark of 
a German rifle seven steps later. But if a captive were 
talented and morally pliable enough to oversee a Nazi 
operation aimed at flooding and destabilizing the 
English economy with reproduced pounds, he might 

last long enough.
As such, Stefan Ruzowitzky’s “The 

Counterfeiters” follows the somber sur-
vival of a notorious forgery artist and 

his clawing attempts to adapt 
to his changing circumstances. The film’s 

encapsulation of Salomon Sorowitsch’s 
(Karl Markovics) story, however, 

is a disappointingly under-
developed effort that 

fails to percolate 
any nuances.

THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  9

A s games evolve, developers gradually tap into their potential to create more engrossing 
experiences, inevitably leading to an 

overextension of creativity. Because of 
technology’s constant advancements, 
more developers are trying to 
incorporate compelling stories into 

gameplay. Though I’m 
usually a proponent of 
anything to further 
the medium’s 

viability, I feel 
that in trying 
to evolve 
s t o r y t e l l i n g 

m e t h o d s , 
develop ers 
are gradually 
focusing less on what 

makes a compelling 
experience: the 
gameplay.

While Super 
Mario Bros. 

was essentially the first game that featured clear 
plot advancement, Final Fantasy was the first 
to focus on the game's story. By introducing 
relatable characters and compelling plots, 
these games were the first to craft poignant 
narratives we truly cared for. Despite the 
success of these RPGs, Final Fantasy owes 
much of its success to classic tabletop RPGs 

like Dungeons 
& Dragons. 
Yet  what 
makes D&D so 
intriguing and 
everlasting is 
its bare-boned 
nature. In 
contrast to the 
s tor y - c e nt r i c 
Final Fantasy, 

D&D defined itself through game mechanics 
and relied heavily on gamers’ imaginations. 
    I imagine that the problems of today’s 
storytelling techniques lie in developers’ 

 gled with whores, hedonism and bloody violence —

It’s been over five years since Fernando Meirelles 
took us to the “City of God,” a schizophrenic, 
emotional, Scorsese-esque look at crime-ridden 
Brazil and arguably the best film of the decade. In 
a sort of weird full-circle, Meirelles produced the 
acclaimed Brazilian series “City of Men,” which 
has, oddly enough, found its way to a big screen 
adaptation.

Though not a sequel, and not nearly as frantic 
as its predecessor, the continuing survey of inner-

city gang warfare this time zooms in on the lives 
of Acerola (Douglas Silva) and Laranjinha (Darlan 
Cunha), two boys who find their friendship threatened 
by an age-old secret when one of them sets out to 
find his long-lost father, engulfed in a merciless war 
between feuding gangs. What follows is a painful 
re-examining of the past amid an escalating conflict 
between friends, families, gangs and the police. 
Paulo Morelli directs this moving tale of the personal 
toll of a country’s struggles. (CM)

for Salomon and Communism for Atze (Veit 
Stubner). While their escalating conflict 
forms most of the film’s explosive dramatic 
tension, it’s offset by an array of minor char-
acters. Segregated from the mass of starving 
prisoners, the principles each come to rep-
resent the vote for which is more important: 
life or integrity. As Atze continues to stall the 
production of forged American dollars, his 
reasons are morally justifiable. Yet being just 
one individual, his personal fortitude is just 
that — only his own. In its climatic moment 
of truth, deus ex machina intervenes and the 
potential undesirable sentiments of the audi-
ence are averted. 

Acting often goes unappreciated in for-
eign films for two reasons: 1) The audience 
is unable to detect the linguistic tones and 
inflection of the performer and 2) our eyes 
are too busy scuttling the bottom of the 
screen trying to read simplified subtitles. 
Pleasantly enough, Markovic’s Salomon isn’t 
overly dependent on either. His square fea-
tures and heavy eyes lend the visage of a cal-
culating stoic. Rather than feign a character’s 
blooming sense of compassion, Markovic 
uses the role as a criminal wise to the ways 
of the world and mankind. After all, he 
could have been a skilled artist, but chose 
instead the comfortable life of a counterfeit-
ing criminal.

The film falls apart outside the relatively 
stock narrative, simply enough, by its art 
direction. Striations and stripes cohesively 
lend some thematic unity but their trite usage 
dissolves into redundancy. The cinematog-
raphy does the same; coupled with heav-
ily charcoaled shadows and an oppressively 
sullen blue tint, its stylistic characteristics 
lack originality — it’s imitative melancholia. 
Although it fittingly captures a desired tone 

(and even contrasts it well with the artifi-
cially immaculate and sterile shades of white 
when artistically relevant), similar to many 
other aspects of the film, it’s all something 
we’ve vaguely seen before.

Winning an Oscar will definitely entice 
a larger audience; yet when films such as 
Cristian Mungiu’s “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 

2 Days” failed to even get nominated, the 
Academy’s selection becomes noticeably 
incomplete. If this win helps to encourage 
the renaissance of independent Austrian 
films, then it at least accomplishes some-
thing. However, “The Counterfeiters” seems 
to be reveling in praise a little too prema-
turely.

chips). 
But, while there are plenty of brief nudie scenes 

to satisfy the restless (Madame Sonia’s topless girls 
are a high point), the sexual tension between Terry 
and Martine is so thinly veiled that when they 
finally have their make-out moment in the safe, it’s 
only faintly stirring. 

Riches and naughty bits aside, other incriminat-
ing material is in the safe-deposit box to further 
twist the story — there’s also a list of all the bribes 
paid to the shady British police force by Lew Vogel 
(David Suchet). 

When word of the heist gets out, Vogel pursues 
the robbers who find the compromising ledger, 
adding to the quick-paced chaos that culminates 
in its aftermath (which takes the first half of the 
movie to explain and execute). Essentially, as Terry 
remarks so eloquently, “shit hits the proverbial 
fan.” 

Director Roger Donaldson is aware of the 
potential mess in such a complex screenplay, and 
manages to keep his audience on board most of the 
way; we glimpse the larger condition of Britain’s 
political frailty, and the intimate portraits of those 
caught within its cat’s cradle. The production 
designers channel early ’70s Brit style and London 
Soho in all its sideburned glory, capturing the 
murky hedonism of a foggy milieu. 

Most exciting is that we realize the story has 
yet to be completely unraveled; like an episode of 
“Unsolved Mysteries,” it ends on a perhaps-we’ll-
never-know note. The police smother the press 
once the photos are retrieved and Terry returns to 
his wife in one piece, if not a little jarred. The heist 
is effectively pushed to the back pages of urban 
legend.

The only standout flimsy spots are the moments 
where scribes Clement and La Frenais overzeal-
ously jam too many swinging plot threads and 
open-ended characters into one crowded frame. 
Still, we mostly accept it, even if we don’t quite 
know what’s going on for the majority of the time. 
“The Bank Job” might not take the biscuit, but it 
has more than enough bite to keep us awake.

desires to create the structural story that 
D&D lacked. For one reason or another, 
it has become an industry trend to sell 
novels in the guise of games. While 
the intellectual in me praises this new 
method of reading stories, the gamer 
in me wants to shove this pretentious 
crap back at the developers. Buying a 
game now is like paying for an expensive 
chocolate mousse only to realize that, 
instead of mousse, I’ve just bought high-
class poop. If I really wanted to read a 
cliched fantasy or science fiction story, 
I could’ve easily walked to the nearest 
Borders.

Last year’s blockbuster Mass Effect is 
a clear offender of the recent novels-as-
games trend. Gamers are forced to read 
all the minute junk scattered throughout 
the game’s universe if they want the full 
experience. Certainly we have the choice 
to read the stuff, but if we don’t, we’re 
not really getting the game we paid for. 
While the multilayered depth to the Mass 
Effect mythos is admittedly compelling, 
the process through which you need to 
obtain the story is excruciatingly tedious 
and overall a misuse of the medium. The 
recently released Lost Odyssey also has 
the same problem, where various aspects 
of the story are told through prose, like 
what you read in your average writing 
class. Since when did it become fun to 
read in games?  It’s like saying I’m not 
good enough to experience the game 
unless I have a literature degree.

Then there are games that force-

feed stories through lengthy cutscenes. 
While I appreciate the art of cinematic 
deftness in some of my favorite games, 
I resent the fact that it’s become an 
industry standard to continually rely 
on cutscenes to move narratives. Metal 
Gear Solid, which arguably set the 
standard for cinematic storytelling, 
had the problem of using too much 

cinema and sacrificing too much game. 
It’s become a well-known joke that if 
you strip away the game’s cutscenes, 
you’re essentially left with a little over 
two hours of gameplay. Too often have I 
found myself playing through the game 
and coming across a random cutscene 
that presents a crucial story element only 
to find that I need to use the bathroom. 
Too often these cutscenes end up being 
absurdly long. Since there’s no other way 
the story can be told, you’re always stuck 
with the cinematics, even in the worst 
situations. 

Titles like Bioshock remind us of 
the game’s potential as an interactive 
medium. Similar to Half-Life, Deus 
Ex and its predecessor System Shock 
2, Bioshock is a perfect example of a 
story that can only be told through the 
interactivity of a video game. Since the 
game is inhabited mostly by corpses and 
mindless monsters in the underwater 
city of Rapture, very rarely are there 
any physical interactions between you 
and other characters. As the player 
you’re told to basically explore the 
city and fight off any enemies. The 
game’s gripping nature, however, is due 
to a story fleshed out through vocal 
interactions with one other character 
and the discovery of audio logs. Though 
players can essentially play the entire 
game without hearing a single line from 
these logs, doing so would defeat the 
game’s purpose. The game and the world 
are inseperable. If we don’t search the 
world, we’re not playing the game. And 
if we’re not playing the game, we’re never 
told a story. The only way to obtain the 
story is to play.

As the medium advances and evolves 
and as the success of games like Portal 
reminds us of the importance of gameplay 
as a method of story advancement, more 
creative developers will find ways to tell 
a story through — and not for — the 
game. And once someone else sets a 
standard, it won’t take long for others 
to follow suit. Until then, I’m crossing 
my fingers for someone adventurous 
to do it.

GET YOUR NOVELLA OUT OF MY GAME
▶ CRITICAL, from page 9

W hat is it about gentle indie-pop that lowers the criti-cal eyebrow and makes your ear muscles disco? Like a lullaby for adults, Some Racing, Some Stopping 
is a 30-minute musical exploration of soothing folk 
synth, powerful orchestration and the beautiful timbre 
of Ms. Erin Fein. The result is a collaboration that could 
moonlight as the soundtrack to “The Royal Tenenbaums” 
— that is, if the ’Baums weren’t such Negative Nancys.

The album is sticky with love ballads and the nostalgic 
regret of passing time, but even with the tried-and-true 
topics up for lyrical discourse, Headlights manages to 
wrestle audio boredom by keeping it light. Every melody 
is either a hum-worthy beat or sweetly timid anthem. 
Songs like “Market Girl” exude a hipster dance quality 
that’s reminiscent of early Rilo Kiley, filled with insistent 
guitar strums, poodle-skirt sentimentality and impish 
devilry. 

But the collection’s dulcet slowdowns end up grabbing 
just as much of the spotlight as their extroverted counter-
parts. Ditties like “School Boys” percolate with “doo doo 
ahhs” and choral violins that mash up synthesizer sweeps. 
The self-titled track’s dawdling organ boil melts into a 
honeyed cloy that lingers long after the song has mean-
dered away. “Some Racing” is the pound puppy that gets 
a home instead of put down because of its big ol’ baleful 
eyes and happy lil’ heart. Even with the simplistic themes 
and typical genre blend, the track gushes with idealism 
and a come-hither dreaminess. 

The only downside to the endeavor is the meager help-
ing of goods that you get. After all the happy-go-lucky 
rockin’, you realize you’ve only listened to enough music 
to barely get you through half an episode of “Flavor of 
Love 3.” And though the hard-touring band has been 
fine-tuning their songwriting in lieu of further densifying 
their sound, the least they could do is throw a little more 
on your plate. But quality is always better then quantity, 
so half an hour of Headlights is better then 60 minutes of 
a shriveled-up rapper trying to stick it to some hoes any 
day. Yadadamean?

I f our grandparents grew up in the modern age and our parents were raised in the postmodern age, what is the age of our generation? The post-postmodern age? This 
lack of concrete identity in a world of increasingly ambiv-
alent ambiguity is the cross Ray Davies carries through 
his second solo album, Working Man’s Cafe. Granted, the 
former Kinks front man — yes, the same Brit band which 
undeservedly fell by the superstardom wayside against 
the Beatles and the Who — is pushing senior citizen sta-
tus, but don’t let that stop you from thinking he’s any less 
concerned about these absurdist times. 

In fact, when it comes to yuppie rockers lambast-
ing latter-day culture (remember Neil Young two years 
ago?), Davies’ songwriting, laced in doubt and confu-
sion, may be the most honest of them all.

Assuming the voice of the everyman worker, Davies 
— whose voice still has its world-weary traveler wail — 
confesses his fears and observations to unnamed lovers 
through every modern angle: globalization (“Vietnam 
Cowboys”), constant warfare (“Peace In Our Time”), 
and faith (“Hymn For a New Age”). The guitars are 

angry and there’s barely a tune set under a jogger’s pace, 
but Davies steers the album from blind politicization 
when it would have been all too easy. “You’re Asking 
Me” comes as a clear indicator that he wants nothing 
to do with changing the world anymore. He just wants 
to survive.

For the few of you who proudly wear your Kinks 
fandom on your sleeves, Cafe’s tracks — damn catchy, 
if not particularly memorable — come off as minor but 
welcomed. Unlike other Invasion songwriters, Davies’ 
penchant for crafting lyrical melodies didn’t burn out 
at midlife. Rather, after a 20-year hiatus (his first solo 
album appeared only last year), it’s more that all this 
music has built up in his system and he’s too compelled 
to not play it. By the final refrain of closer “The Real 
World,” it’s apparent that this new burst of creativity is 
not only personal and faintly political, but also an exor-
cism of the pop star’s demons.

I f Howlin Rain were a soup of the day, they would definitely be a cream-based chowder, with chunks of Steve Miller floating in it and a sprig of Allman 
Brothers for garnish. Sounds tasty, doesn’t it? Well, it is. 
After all, chowder is a comfort food and Howlin Rain’s 
’70s throwback vibe is familiar and warming.

The group’s sophomore effort, Magnificent Fiend, 
starts off with a just-under-a-minute number, 
“Requiem,” whose flamboyant horns over a piano 
tremolo could easily be the soundtrack to a Mexican 
standoff in some Spaghetti western. This segways into 
the in-your-face unbridled energy of “Dancers at the 
End of Time,” whose epic-sounding title goes well with 
the track’s psychedelic rock. It’s as if  “Sunshine of Your 
Love” and Vanilla Fudge mated and brought forth from 
their loins some decadent offspring with a penchant for 
guitar solos.

The real gem of the album, however — the yummy, 
gooey rock nougat of it all — is at the center of “Lord 
Have Mercy.” The track starts off deceptively groovy and 

mellow, complete with organs and jazzy piano backing, 
but it climaxes in fuzz guitar glory and gospel drama 
with Miller and choir proclaiming, “Lord, He has my 
number under the thunder, in his hand!” It makes you 
want to stand up from your pew, arms over your head 
and echo back a resounding “amen!” to Miller.

Magnificent Fiend’s every track takes its listener on 
different sonic trips. Elements of gospel, psychedelic 
and swamp wrap their legs around each other on all 
eight songs. With all the solos, from the ever-apparent 
guitars to the unexpected Hammond organ, Howlin 
Rain’s got this genre-blurring thing down.

However, even though the epic solos and shredded 
voice may appear authentic, the music can at times feel 
more like throwback homage than an original under-
taking. Nevertheless, the familiarity is comforting. Stuff 
tastes better renuked anyways.

throws with 3:59 left in the half. 
Osier’s jumper at the end of the peri-
od preserved the Tritons’ seven-point 
advantage as UCSD entered halftime 
nursing a 31-24 lead over the Gators. 

The Gators opened up the sec-
ond half with a three-pointer to cut 
UCSD’s lead to four points but Noud 
responded with her third three-point-
er of the night to give the Tritons a 
34-27 lead. Despite several question-
able calls from the referees that put 
senior center Alexis Gaskin in early 
foul trouble, the Tritons managed to 
extend their lead to open up an 11-
point advantage over the Gators.

“It was tough because it almost 
seemed like we were fighting with 
the refs who were not calling fouls 
or sometimes calling strange fouls,” 
Gaskin said. “Still, we kept it together 
and kept our composure.” 

The Tritons’ double-digit lead did 
not last long, however, as the Gators 
capitalized on UCSD turnovers to 
chip away at the Tritons’ advantage. 
With 4:26 left in regulation, the 
Gators scored a three-point basket to 
cut UCSD’s lead to 52-50 and climbed 
within one possession of the Tritons.

“We definitely didn’t expect them 
to come back in it,” Osier said. “We 
wanted to extend our lead coming 
out of halftime, but anything can 
happen when you play a team for the 
third time [in a season].”

With the game tied at 56 and less 
than one minute in regulation, Gaskin 
collected the offensive board from 
Noud’s missed jump shot and passed 
the ball to Osier in the post. Osier 
missed a tough shot, collected her 
own rebound and was fouled while 
putting up another shot. With eight 
seconds remaining, Osier knocked 
down both her free throws to give the 

Tritons a 58-56 lead. 
The Tritons forced a turnover 

on the ensuing possession and, after 
a San Francisco State foul, Gaskin 
hit one of two free throw attempts 
to extend the Tritons lead to 59-56. 
The Gators could not convert on a 
last-second shot attempt, sealing the 
victory for the Tritons and sending 

UCSD to the CCAA semifinals.
Osier had game-high totals of 26 

points and 18 rebounds, including 
13 offensive boards. Noud scored 17 
points for UCSD and Gaskin added 
12 points and nine rebounds.

“This is the playoffs — everybody 
is at their best,” head coach Charity 
Elliott said. “We beat a talented and 
hardworking team in San Francisco 
State. Osier had a phenomenal game 
with 13 [offensive] rebounds and 
[senior guard Alexis] Mezzetta did 
a great job taking care of the ball. 
Annette Ilg and Laura Moore stepped 
in and Gaskin played well for a huge 
team win.”

The Tritons’ next game will come 
against Sonoma State University in 
San Bernardino on March 7 at 12:30 
p.m. The two teams split the season 
series, with the Tritons posting a 72-
59 victory at home in the most recent 
of the two meetings.

“Sonoma’s a very talented team,” 
Elliott said. “We split with them this 
season and I expect it to be 40 min-
utes of battle.”

The winner of that contest and 
the winner of the following game 
between Chico State University and 
Cal Poly Pomona will face off on 
March 8 in the CCAA Championship 
game.

The Tritons return to action inside 
San Bernardino’s Coussoulis Arena 
on Friday against San Francisco 
State. The Gators, seeded sixth in 
the tournament, also scored a 60-57 
upset over third-seeded Cal State Los 
Angeles. San Francisco State swept 

the season series with UCSD, win-
ning by 10 in overtime at RIMAC 
Arena during Spirit Night and by 
nine at home in the Tritons’ regular 
season finale.

early leads and holding onto them.

UCSD stopped the bleeding in 
game three with solid serving that 
began long runs. Behind sophomore 
outside hitter Jason Spangler’s serv-

points of the game. CSU Northridge 
got no closer than six points the rest of 
the way as UCSD cruised to the win.

Hoping to build on its momen-

Despite the loss, the team was still

Fritsch finished the game with one of 
his game-high 17 kills.

Clinging to a 23-22 advantage in 
game two, the Tritons scored the final 
seven points behind the serving arm 
of freshman setter Phil Bannan, who 
finished the game with an ace. 

UCSD came out firing in game 
three and built an early 7-3 lead. After 
the Gauchos tied the game at 9-9, the 

Tritons ran off four straight points to 
regain the lead for good. Fritsch again 
thwarted any chance of a comeback 
with four kills at the end of the game.

The win was the Tritons’ fifth, 
which matches last year’s total with 11 
games left. Ring has been working all 
season to find the right lineup and the 
one they used seemed to work well.

“The guys that played last weekend 
did a real nice job but we don’t have a 

definite first string,” he said. “We have 
many guys in the gym that can take 
over and it creates a lot of competition 
amongst players forcing them to keep 
working hard.”

The victory was short lived, as No. 
4 Cal State Northridge crushed any 
thoughts of back-to-back wins with 
its 30-24, 30-22, 20-30, 30-25 triumph 

fourth quarter, using their bench play-
ers and not allowing the Sagehens to 
get back into the game. Scores from 
junior attacker Sydney Gstettenbauer 
and Hermann early in the period 
secured the win for the Tritons.

“We played defense really well 
which is why we win games,” head 
coach Larry Sanders said. “We need 
the killer instinct to put the ball in 
the cage. We need to play better on 
offense.”

Emaus had little trouble offensively 
in the game, leading Triton scoring 
with four goals to help give UCSD its 
third straight win. 

UCSD used a balanced attack to 
defeat Cal State Bakersfield earlier in 
the day. The Tritons jumped out to 
a 2-0 lead in the first quarter over 
the Roadrunners and maintained the 
lead for the entire game, playing solid 
defense and putting away goals with 
consistency.

With less than two minutes left in 
the game, the Roadrunners netted a 
goal to cut the Tritons lead to 6-5. But 
Bloom answered back with a six-on-
five score to help the Tritons hold on 
and win by a final score of 7-5. 

Emaus led the scoring with two 
goals in a game that featured scores 
from five different Tritons. The vic-
tory was also UCSD’s 400th in the 
program’s history. 

“We knew we needed two wins 
and we did what we needed to do as a 
team,” Hermann said. 

UCSD’s next game will come 
against No. 6 UC Davis at the two-day 
Loyola Marymount Tournament in Los 
Angeles starting March 7. The Tritons 
will then have a rematch against Cal 
State Bakersfield before playing against 

Sonoma State University and Santa 
Clara University.

“It’s going to be a big weekend for 
us,” Hermann said. “We have a chance 
to go 4-0 and prove that we’re a force to 
be reckoned with in the conference.”

offense.”
UCSD again extended a double-

digit lead early in the second half, but 
the Coyotes used three three-pointers 
as part of a 17-6 run to tie the game at 
35 with 13:31 left to play. The Tritons 
responded and regained the lead on a 
three-pointer from sophomore guard 
Jordan Lawley and would extend it to 
as much as a seven-point lead at both 
the 6:35 and 4:13 marks. However, 
UCSD was able to muster only two 
free throws over the final four minutes, 
missing four chances at the line, two 
field goal attempts, and turning the ball 
over twice in that span. San Bernardino 
tied the game with 41 seconds to play 
after the Coyotes’ Lance Ortiz recorded 
a steal, a layup, drew a foul and hit 
the subsequent free throw for the old-
fashioned three-point play. After two 
missed free throws from Jordan Lawley 
and two Coyote missed three-point-
ers, the teams headed to overtime tied 
at 54.

“I was a little bit disappointed at 
the way we executed toward the end of 
regulation,” Carlson said. “The thing I 
told our guys is we’ve been here before; 
we know how to play in this situation. If 
you’re a competitor at this time of year, 
this is the fun part, to be in a highly con-
tested game in March. All great com-
petitors want to be in that situation”.

The Tritons, who entered the game 
mired in a five-game losing streak 
that included a 70-55 defeat at San 
Bernardino less than two weeks earlier, 
trailed for the first time in the game after 
a jumper from the Coyotes’ Renaldo 
Bass opened the extra period. The lead 
would be short-lived, as Lawlor tied 
the game for UCSD at the line on the 
next possession. Lawley avenged his 
earlier free throw misses with a three-
pointer on the next Triton possession. 
Junior guard Andrew Hatch extended 
the UCSD advantage to two possessions 
with a layup with 2:04 to play. Ortiz hit 

two free throws on the other end, part of 
a 9-for-9 performance from the line, to 
bring the Coyotes within two at 61-59. 
After two missed shots for UCSD and 
a turnover and missed jumper by the 
Coyotes, Lawlor grabbed the defensive 
rebound and headed to the line with 17 
seconds left to play. UCSD’s struggles at 
the charity stripe continued as Lawlor 
missed both chances. However, an Ortiz 
three-point attempt was off-line on the 
other end and Lawlor grabbed his 10th 
rebound of the game, was fouled and 
made both from the line to cap the four-
point Triton win.

“We’ve never beaten Cal State San 
Bernardino at San Bernardino,” said 
Hatch, who is in his fourth and final 
season with the Tritons. “And to make 
it a playoff win where we have so much 
on the line … It’s definitely very special 
to me.”

UCSD was able to overcome a 
38.3-percent field-goal shooting per-
formance, as the team was able to hold 
its opponent to an even worse 35.4 
percent, including 6-of-20 shooting in 
the first-half and just one field goal in 
overtime. The Tritons also converted 
8-of-17 from three-point range, while 
both teams grabbed 37 rebounds and 
committed only 10 turnovers.

Lawlor recorded a double-double 
with his 12 points and 10 rebounds, 
while Lawley was the high scorer for 
UCSD with 13 points, while adding 
five rebounds and four assists. Hatch 
and sophomore forward Andrew 
Browning rounded out the Tritons 
in double-digits, each coming off the 
bench to add 10 points.

“When we’ve had success this 
year, it’s because we’ve shown great 
balance,” Carlson said. “We’re not a 
team that’s going to just go to one guy 
to get 25 points a night. We’re a group 
that relies on every piece of the puzzle 
and I think we again showed that.”

Tritons Advance to CCAA Semis

By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

Although their first playoff game proved to be more nerve-racking than they had hoped, the Tritons came out on top of a nail-biter against San Francisco State University to advance to the semifinals of the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship 
Tournament. The Tritons held on to post a 59-56 victory over the visiting Gators that improved 

their record to 23-8. 
The CCAA quarterfinal 

game took place only four days 
after the Tritons earned a 63-47 
victory over the Gators in San 
Francisco, but bore very little 
resemblance to that decisive vic-
tory. Junior forward Michelle 
Osier, whose free throws near 
the end of regulation would 
prove to be the game’s winning 
points, fittingly opened up the 
scoring with two free throws to 
give the Tritons a 2-0 lead. 

The two teams played a close 
game for the first several min-
utes of the half with the Gators 
eventually taking their first lead 
at 16-14 with 10:08 to play in the 
half. After sophomore forward 
Erin Noonan hit a jumper to tie 
the game at 18, Noonan suffered 
a nasty fall while taking a charge 
for UCSD that sent her to the 
locker room for the rest of the 
game. 

The Tritons continued to 
fight hard without Noonan, 
pulling sophomore guards Laura 
Moore and Annette Ilg off the 
bench to fill in for the starting 
forward. Playing well on both 
sides of the ball, the Tritons 
took a 27-20 lead off of senior 
forward Meaghan Noud’s free

The Tritons kept their season alive on March 3 with a 63-59 overtime upset win against No. 13 Cal State San Bernardino, the program’s first ever postseason win at the Division-II level. CSU San Bernardino, which will still host the remainder of the CCAA Tournament, finished 
the season as the conference’s regular season co-champions. The Coyotes have won seven of the last 
nine CCAA Championships, and 
were the No. 2 seed in the CCAA 
Tournament. The seventh-seed-
ed Tritons improve to 16-11 on 
the season and will next face San 
Francisco State in a CCAA semifi-
nals matchup on March 7.

Head coach Chris Carlson’s 
squad came out firing with three-
pointers from junior forward 
Darryl Lawlor and senior guard 
Clint Allard that put UCSD ahead 
6-0 just under two minutes into the 
game. Those six points would be 
more than the Coyotes could score 
in the first 11 and a half minutes, 
with UCSD holding a 14-5 advan-
tage more than halfway through 
the first half. UCSD led by as much 
as 14 after two free throws from 
junior guard Alan Husted put the 
score at 23-9 with under two min-
utes to play. However, with 1:35 left 
in the half, the Coyotes staged a 
little run, netting seven points and 
cutting UCSD’s lead to eight at the 
break. The Coyotes’ 14 points in 
the first half was seven points fewer 
than their previous lowest scoring 
half on the year.

“We just went back to play-
ing really good defense,” junior 
guard Andrew Hatch said. “I think 
that’s what we’ve lacked the last 
five games. We took away their 

UCSD blows an early lead but finishes strong in overtime to beat the 
Coyotes and earn the program’s first postseason win in Division II.

WATER POLO — The No. 16 UCSD 
women’s water polo team used the 
momentum from its last win over 
No. 13 UC Santa Barbara to post two 
conference victories at home over the 
weekend. The Tritons won their first 
game on March 1 against Cal State San 
Bernardino by a score of 7-5 before 
finishing the day with a 10-7 victory 
over Pomona-Pitzer. The two wins 
over unranked opponents improve 
UCSD’s record to 7-10 overall.

The Tritons had several chances to 
score in the opening minutes against 
Pomona-Pitzer, but struggled to put 
the ball in the cage. They drew their 
first ejection with 6:50 left in the first 
quarter, but were unable to convert 
on any of their three attempts on goal. 
For much of the first quarter, UCSD 
made the Pomona-Pitzer goalkeeper’s 
job easy as the crossbar blocked most 
of the Tritons’ shot attempts.

The scoreless tie was finally bro-
ken as senior two-meter Judy Emaus 
used her weak hand to get around a 
Sagehen defender and score a counter-
attack goal with 3:17 left in the quarter. 
Emaus quickly put the Tritons up 2-0 
with another counterattack goal on 
UCSD’s next possession.

UCSD’s defense, backed by senior 
goalkeeper Kim Hockett, held the 
Sagehens scoreless for the entire first 
quarter, successfully fronting Pomona-
Pitzer’s two-meter and getting steals 
on the perimeter. The Tritons added 
another goal on senior utility Nicole 

Hermann’s six-on-five goal with less 
than a minute left in the first period to 
give UCSD a 3-0 lead.

The second quarter was dominated 
by defense with Pomona-Pitzer dis-
rupting the Triton offense by crashing 
at the two-meters once the Tritons 
passed the ball inside. Hockett impres-
sively defended the goal for the Tritons, 
blocking a Pomona-Pitzer shot attempt 
on the Sagehens’ six-on-five. With 3:05 
left in the half, Hockett blocked a 
five-meter penalty shot to preserve 
the Tritons’ 3-0 lead. However, the 
Sagehens finally took advantage of a 
UCSD ejection to score their first goal 
of the game and cut the Tritons’ lead to 
3-1 with 2:28 left in the half. 

With the Tritons unable to answer 
back before the half, the Sagehens 
remained only two goals behind the 
Tritons heading into the third quar-
ter. Pomona-Pitzer took advantage of 
another six-on-five advantage with 
5:58 left in the third quarter to score 
its second goal of the game and cut the 
Tritons’ lead to 3-2.

Following a double ejection and 
another ejection drawn by Emaus, 
sophomore attacker Audra Bloom 
scored on a five-on-four UCSD advan-
tage that gave the Tritons a 4-2 lead. 
After Pomona-Pitzer answered back 
with a score, the Tritons added a goal 
apiece from sophomore two-meter 
defender Emilia Halmay and Emaus to 
push UCSD’s lead to 6-3 at the end of 
the third period.

VOLLEYBALL — After playing most 
of February on the road, the Tritons 
were glad to return home. UCSD 
didn’t fare well on the long road trip, 
dropping all five of its matches — how-
ever, nothing says welcome home bet-
ter than a three-game sweep of No. 12 
UC Santa Barbara.

That’s what happened Feb. 29, when 
UCSD began its nine-game home stand 
with a decisive 30-27, 30-22, 30-24 vic-
tory over the Gauchos. The sweep was 
the program’s first against a Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation opponent, 
and only the second time UCSD has 
beaten UCSB in 34 contests. After a 
close first game, the Tritons dominated, 
as two players tallied double-digit kills 
and the team hit .420 for the contest.

Head coach Kevin Ring has said 
all season that the team struggles to 
put points on the board with its serve, 
but it wasn’t a problem against the 
Gauchos as UCSD used late runs in all 
three games en route to the upset.

“Really we’re just playing better vol-
leyball,” Ring said. “They would go on 
little runs but within one or two servers 
we’d come back and keep that three or 
four point cushion. Our kill percentage 
improved and our offense is making 
less mistakes. Being able to play a team 
like UC Santa Barbara and close them 
out is a huge confidence boost.”

Game one saw six ties before UCSD 
took a 20-18 lead. The lead slimmed 
to one before UCSD strung together 
four points to take a commanding 
25-20 lead. Sophomore opposite Frank SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN

Sophomore opposite Frank Fritsch was a crucial component in the Tritons’ first-ever sweep of a Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation team, tallying a team-high 17 kills on .520 hitting against UCSB on Feb. 29.
