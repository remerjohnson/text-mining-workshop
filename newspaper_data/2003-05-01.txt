By THOMAS NEELEY 

Senior Staff Writer 

Ending several months of 
peculation, Energy Secretary 

Spencer Abraham announced on 
April 30 that the contract to man-
age Los Alamos ational 
Laboratory will be made open to 
competitive bidding, and that the 
University of California will have 
to compete in order to retain the 
contract. 

Although he praised the man-
agement improvements made by 
the University of California, 
Abraham maintained that the uni -
versity bears responsibility for the 
laboratory's management failures. 

"Given that responsibility and 
the wide pread nature of the

problems 
uncovered at 
Lo Alamos, I 
intend to open 
the manage-
ment of Lo 
Alamos to full 
competition 
when the cur-
rent contract 
expires, " 
Abraham said 
in a statement. 
The current 
contract with 

the university is set to end III 
eptember 2005 . 

The University of California 
has managed the ew Mexico lab-
oratory uninterrupted since It 
incepuon in 1943 . The labora tory 
employs 7,600 people and has an 
annual budget of $ 1.6 billion. The 
University of Califorrua also man-
ages Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory and Lawrence 
Livermore Nauonal Laboratory. 

Abraham noted that the 
University of California is still eli -
gible for the contra t and said that 
he "strongly agreed" that the uni -
ver ity should compete for the lab-
ora tory. 

"1 categorica lly reject the 
notion that competition i a repu-
diation of an incumbent contrac-
tor or that an in umbent contrac-
ror is inherently incapable of pre-
vailing in a competition ," 
Abraham said.

ZNEW THE U D GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY I, Z003 

BRIEFLY ETCETERA ••• 
Online library catalogue 
launched for UC system 
The new online Melvyl-T catalog, which 

will allow Califomia Digitaf Library patrons to 
search more than 23 million records for 
matenal held by the libraries of the 10 UC 
campuses, was rolled out April 23. 

Compared to the legacy Melo,yl catalog. 
which will continue operating until Au~ust 
2003, Melvyl-T has a new format and design, 
offers users a variety of enhanced features, 
and contains completely updated data for the 
holdings of the UC system. Once the legacy 
Melvyl catalog has been retired, Melvyl-T (for 
Transition) will become Melvyl. 

The MelvyI-T has refined and expanded 
search features that are a significant advance 
over the legacy MeIvyI catalog. These features 
indude more flexible search options. induding 
phrase and proximity searching; browsing by 
major indexes, induding authOr. title, suoject 
and call number; expanded limiting and sorting 
of search results; display of foreign language 
materials using their native language characters, 
induding Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew 
and Arabic; and the ability to retum to previous 
searches and combine, r€'VIew or save them 
Into a personal workspace. 

Melo,yl-T is at http//melvyl.cdlib.org and 
also available via the CDL Web site 
(http//WNN.cd!Jb.org), which contains infor-
mation about the catalog and other digital 
collections and services. 

Web site lends insisht to 
college composition 

A new Web site called the uc Writing 
Institute, which contains information about 
writin~ programs and instruction offered 
throu out the entire UC system, has just 
been aunched. 

The purpose of the site, which was 
designed for people interested in college 
composition, is to provide Information about 
writing requirements, courses and special 
programs offered by each UC campus; sup-
ply resources on writing and writing instruc-
tion; and present the results 01 faculty 
research In the teaching of wnting. 

The Web Site, which IS located at 
http://WNN.ucwrite.org, currently includes 
Information about first-year wnting programs 
for UC freshmen, resources for ESL/multilin-
gual wnters and a section on the use of tech-
nology in teaching writing. 

ConceIVed as an institute as well as a Web 
Site, UCWRITE will additionally serve as a 
place where instructors can share research, 
new dassroom technologies and teaching 
materials, as well as discuss philosophies oT 
instruction and composition.

UCSD Lit Professor receives 
Guggenheim Fellowship 
UCSD Professor of Comparative Literature 

Lisa Lowe has been granted a Guggenheim 
Fellowship for 2003. 

Lowe is among 184 artists, scholars and 
scientists who were selected from more than 
3,200 applicants to receive awards at the 
John Simon Guggenheim Memorial 
Foundation's 79th annual United States and 
Canadian competition. Awards for all recipi-
ents total $6,750,000. 

Fellows are appointed on the basis of dis-
tinguished achievement in the past and excep-
tional promise for future accomplishment 

Lowe has been on the UCSD faculty since 
1986. She received a bachelor's degree in 
history from Stanford University and a doctor-
ate in literature from UC Santa Cruz. 

Staph infection described 
!iy UCSD researchers 

For the first time, UCSD School of 
Medicine researchers have described the 
method that Staphylococcus au reus infection 
uses to inactivate the body's immune 
response and cause previously healthy B cells 
to commit suicide. 

Normally, B cells mount an early defense 
against invading bacteria. From this immuno-
logic experience, memory B cells are devel-
oped with the ability to quickly recognize 
these antigens and destroy the bacteria if 
they retum in the future. When staph infec-
tions occur, however, this important process 
for immune defense can be corrupted. 

In studies with mice, the researchers 
found that a staph protein called SpA acts like 
a B cell toxin to ultimately cause their 
death. Althoui1 B cells begin to respond, 
they are quickTy shut down Decause the SpA 
deactivates B cell's antigen receptors. Then, 
within a few hours, the SpA toxin induces B 
cells to tum on themselves in a programmed 
suicide process called apoptosis. As a direct 
consequence, the B cells never get a chance 
to develop the memory cells necessary to 
recognize and fight future staph infections. 

In follow-up studies, the researchers will 
examine people with staph infections to veri-
fy that the same process takes place and that 
it prevents individuals from defending against 
staph infections. 

The study appears in the May 5 issue of 
the Joumal of Experimental Medicine.

A.S. COUNCIL AT A CLANCE 

A.S. Meeting f30 
February JO, 2003 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item 8 

The A.S. Council unanimously approved 
the commission of an ad hoc task force that 
will look at revising A.S. Election Bylaws. 
Penned by Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore senator Jeff Le, the task force 
charter states that the ad hoc group "shall 
serve to research, evaluate and reform the 
ASUCSD Election Bylaws that could be 
implemented at UCSD in order to improve 
the electoral process." According to the char-
ter, the tasle force will provide the A.S. 
Council with recommendations and advice on 
what changes should be made to current 
bylaws by second weelc of spring quarter 
ZOO4. The voting bloc of the tasle force will be 
composed of one representative from each 
college council, two representatives from the 
A.S. Council and four at-large representa-
tives. The task force will meet biweelcly and 
meetings are to be well publicized and "acces-
sible to interested students." 

Item C 
A proposed amendment to the A.S. 

Constitution that would have added the stip-
ulation "shall never have sexually harassed 
anyone" to Qualifications for fficers failed 
to reach the counCIl Ooor. Submitted by Jenn 
Brown and co-sponsored by Navneet rewal 
and Amy Uye Iuma, the amendment did not 
receive a motion to make lorc and died 
accordingly . 

Reports 
Commissioner of Services and Enterprises 
Jeremy Gallagher 

allagher reported that he had requested 
legislation for the ,rove Cafe thaI would 
award manager at the Grove I percent of the 

Grove's accumulated profit in a year, provided 
the enterprise made at least S I 0,000. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman sen-
ator Max Harrington 

Harrington reported that the 
Campus/Community Planning Committee 
rejected a proposal for an A.S. ropes course to 
be located in the Eucalyptus grove below 
RIMAC Arena. Council members are cur-
rently worlc:ing on drafting a new proposal 
with a new location for the ropes course, 
which would generate funds for the 
ASUCSD. 

Old Business 
After pulling to the council floor an 

amendment to A.S. Election Bylaws that 
would make candidate disqualification 
require a three-quarters vote of the Elections 
Committee, the A.S. Council voted 9-8-1 to 
refer the amendment and several others 
regarding elections reform to the newly cre-
ated A.S. Task Force on Electoral Revision. 
The council was split between those who 
argued the tasle force would be better suited 
to addre s issues of election reform and those 
who felt that the A.S. Council should, as a 
representative body, address the issue itself. 
Jeff Le, who authored most of the proposed 
reforms in addition to the charter for the task 
force, expressed disappointment that the 
council was not willing to tackle the amend-
ments itself. Proposed amendments included 
candidate notification of po sible bylaws vio-
lations, malc:ing the misleading of voters a 
punishable violation and definitions of the 
terms "poster," "campaign," "classroom cam-
paigning" and "preponderance of evidence." 

A.S. Meeting o. 30 was the finalmccting 
of this year's A.S. Council. The ncw A .. 
Council held a speCIal meeting following A. . 
Meeting No. 30.

THUR DAY, MAY I. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Academic Senate addresses romance 
Faculty conduct, teaching awards discussed 

By USAMAK 
Staff Writer 

An amendment providing 
additional wording in the Faculty 
Code of Conduct to directly 
address romantic and sexual rela-
tion hip between faculty mem-
bers and students was the target of 
discussion at the April 29 
Academic Senate meeting. 

The proposed enacmlent of the 
faculty bylaws and academic 
requirements of Sixth College, as 
well as an amendment to the acad-
emic requirements for Thurgood 
Marshall College, were approved 
at the meeting. Recipients of this 
year's Distinguished Teaching 
Awards were al 0 announced and 
approved. 

The Faculty Code of Conduct 
amendment, APM 015, hIS been 
under review both locally and 
throughout the entire UC system. 
The amendment would 9plicidy 
prohibit romantic and sexual rela-
tionships, even if fully consensual, 
between educational fiaculty and 
students. Any such relationship, it 
is asserted, "jeopardizes the 
integrity of the educational 
process." The language of the 
amendment as it currently stands 
would prohibit such relationships 
if a fiaculty member has, or can 
reasonably expect to have in the 
future, "audemic instructional, 
evaluative or supervisory respon-
ibility" over a student. 

"The intent of this revision of 
APM is to address an important 
issue in the Faculty Code of 
Conduct that was not ever direct-
ly addressed, and that has to do 
with the nature of faculty-snldent 
relation, romantic, sexual rela-
tions between faculty and tu-

dents," said Joel Dimsdale, chair 
of the San Diego division of the 
Academic Senate. 

According to Dimsdale, the 
amendment addres e issues that 
are subtly different from those of 
sexual harassment. The effort for 
such an amendment began in 
1983 ; it eventually lost steam and 
was revived in ZOO1. Similar poli-
cies at other universities were 
studied in order to evaluate how 
such issues were addressed on 
other campuses. 

Although the amendment was 
not voted on at the meeting, its 
merits and faults were debated. 
Concerns raised about APM 015 
included the ambiguous language 

. of the amendment, its enforceabil-
ity and the nature of the punish-
ment for violations. The amend-
ment will be talcen to the Academic 
Council for consideration. 

The proposed enaconent of 
the bylaws of the faculty of Sixth 
College, as well as the enaconent 
of Regulation 630, which sets the 
academic requirements for Sixth 
College, were approved by the 
Senate at the meeting as well. The 
general education requirements 
for the college emphasize cross-
disciplinary studies and creative 
and ethically informed thinking. 

Michael Schudson, acting 
provost of Thurgood Marshall 
College, presented an amendment 
to his colleges genenl education 
requirements. The amendment, 
approved by the Senate, requires 
engineering majors to complete 
four, instead of three, disciplinary 
breadth courses. This would bring 
the general education require-
ments of engineering majors in 
line with those of all other majors 
at Marshall. 

The change is not expected to 
impede engineering majors ' 
progress toward the completion of 
their degree, since most students 
bring in units through AP or 
transfer credit to meet the lower-
division requirements. Of this 
year's 121 entering engineering 
majors, only nine students did not 
clear the lower division breadth 
requirement through approved 
credit. 

In order to better accommo-
date six-unit courses from the 
University of California and the 
Education Abroad Program, as 
well as the increase in one-, two-
and three-unit labs, the amend-
ment will allow Marshall College 
to adopt the sixty-unit measure 
for graduation requirements. 
Thus, students will need to com-
plete a minimum of 60 units at the 
upper-division level out of the 180 
units needed to graduate. 
Previously, a minimum of 15 
upper-division units had to be 
completed out of 4S courses. 

The Committee on 
Distinguished Teaching 
Nominations for 2002-03 also 
presented its list of winners for 
this years awards. Awards were 
presented by division, and awards 
were also given to a nonsenate 
faculty member and a graduate 
student. The list of recipients was 
approved by the Senate, and the 
awards ceremony will take place 
on May IZ in the Faculty Club. 

"There's an awful lot of good 
teaching that goes on at this cam-
pus," said Daniel Hallin, vice 
chair of the committee. ~It always 
makes me want to go and hear 
some of these lectures and possi-
bly makes me a little envious of 
the slcill of some of the teachers."

Council: Appointing 
replacements is a priority 

continued from page I 
Vacancies in the positions of vice 

president external and commission-
ers of srudent advocacy, program-
ming, academic affairs, diver ity 
affairs and communications were 
temporarily filled with the interim 
appointments of incumbent officers 
at the meeting. 

Permanent appointments will 
be made upon Gallagher's recom-
mendation and council approval 
during eighth week, according to 
Gallagher. Applications for the 
vacant positions are due May 9. 

"My main concern is the unfilled 
commissioner and vice president 
external positions," Gallagher said. 

Gallagher invited all senators, 
cabinet members and ex-officios to 
sit in on appointee interviews. 

"I want as many people who can 
be involved," Gallagher said. "I 
reaJly want all of council to have a 
say in deciding who their commis-
sioners and vice president are. " 

Some have questioned the con-
stitutionality of potentially 
appointing disqualified candidates 
to office. The A.S. Constitution 
stipulates that persons who have 
been "removed from office" are 
ineligible to fill a vacancy in the 
same office during the term in 
which they were removed. 

"My decision is to allow any indi-
vidual to apply and have the oppor-
tunity to be appointed," Gallagher 
stated in his report to council. "It is 
my interpretation [of the 
Constitution] that any person who 
was disqualified from the election 
was not 'removed from office,' 
because she or he was never in 
office." 

Gallagher said that he consulted 
the Judicial Board on the matter 
and that it agreed with his interpre-
tation. 

Appointments will also be made 
for junior senators for John Nllllr 
College, Revelle College, 
Thurgood Marshall College and 
Earl Warren College, and a sopho-
more senator for Warren . 

Vice President Finance Eric 
Webster, an independent candidate 
during elections, expressed excite-
ment at taking office and said that 
his first commission will be Student 
Orgamzation Funding AdVisory 
Board allocations. Webster, who 
won only ZZ percent of the popular 
vote and took office as a result of 
Students First! candidate llarish 

andagopal's disqualification, said 
that he expected questions of his 
office's legitimacy. 

"It's a fair criticism," Webster 
said. "What happened in the elec-
tions was really ugly, [but] under 
the circumstances, the actions 
taken were appropriate." 

Commissioner of Athletics 
Jordan Cross, :Ill independent can-
didate, said that he is ready (0 "hit 
the ground running" and will be 
worlc:ing on garnering athletes' sup-
port of the upcoming University 
Centers expansion fee referendum 
and getting more people involved 
with Triton TIde, initially. 

Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan aid that 
he plans on creating a good foun-
dation for his newly autonomous 
office. Cogan is currently working 
on securing campus approval for an 
A.S. ropes course that would gen-
erate funds for Associated 
Students. 

Gallagher, who ran on the Unity 
slate and would have lost the election 
by 64 votes to Students First! presi-
dential candidate Kevin Shawn Hsu, 
had he not been disqualified, said 
that election events would have an 
effect on the new COunCIl.

officer, the new council can still make a 
beneficial impact on thi campus provided 
they follow a few pieces of sound advice. 

First, the new council, or what there is of 
it, must work to fill the vacant po itions 
quickly and with qualified candidates. One 
sure way to solifidy the student body's recent 
mistrust of the A. . Council would be to 
revert to cronyism, something the students 
who voted in the last A. . elections express-
ly indicated they did not want. 

econd, the new council needs to favor 
real action over virtually meaningless reso-
lution . Considering the current campus cli-
mate, the council needs to affect actual 
change to erase uncertaintly and raise sup-
port for the new campus leadership. 

For this same reason, the council needs to 
focus on local issues. While it's very impor-
tant to EO to Sacramento to lobby against 
CRENa and to fight against further tuition 
hikes, the events surrounding the elections 
and the sharp divide that visioly split UCSD 
community member as a result proved that 
the greatest need is right here at home. 

Fourth, while it has been said again and 
again that student organizations are the "life 
blood" of UCSD, don't forget the individu-
als that this narrow focus often ignores. 

utreach to or~ is great, but the average 
UCSD student I n't necesarily part of one. 
During the last A.S. elections, a mere 17 
percent of UCSD students voted. [t's easy 
and effective to target org in order to get 
elected, but cater to these individuals and 
there's a good chance you'll see that 17 per-
cent figure figure rise come next spring 
quarter. 

Last but not least, the new council should 
be hone t and open about what goes on in 
the A. . Council. ooperaring with campus 
media outlets can only help the new AS. 
Council, provided that they are on task and 
acting honorably on behalf of all of the sru-
dents of UCSD. Because jf they can't talk 
about it, something must be wrong.

Plagiarism a persistent problem 
Causing concern from kindergarten to college 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Staff Writer 

Midterms are upon lIS, and we all 
know what that means - caffeine, 
frenzied p2per writing and tense late-
night visits to the gatekeeper of acadt'-
mic integrity, www.Turnitin.com. 
Professors are increasingly making the 
submisSIOn of papers to Turnitin.com 
part of the paper-writing proce s, 
wruch essentially puts the burden of 
proof on srudents in detenmning the 
legitimacy of written exams. 

Turnitin.com compares submitted 
papers with bodie of text accessible 
throughout the Internet, as well as 
other paper that were submitted for 
the same a Ignment (so-called "peer 
reVIew"). The alln is to deter plagia-
rism, u e of Internet sources and collu-
sion with classmates, and to analyze 
discovered plaglansm so that guilty 
parnes are confronted with solid evi-
dence agalllst them. 

In shan., upholding the uOlverslty's

Universities should imply not have 
to face the problem of habirual and 
sophisticated plagiarism, first becau e 
theres considerable freedom in a uni -
versity environment, and srudents 
should care enough about their classes 
to acrually learn the material . The sec-
ond and more important reason is that 
theres no good way to weed out or deal 
with plagiarism when it's progre sed to 
such an advanced stage and the behav-
ior has been reinforced by years and 
years of getting away with it. 

It's absolutely essential that academ-
ic dishonesty be caught early in a tu-
dents' career, but it rarely IS - and that 
is precisely the problem. The current 
educational enVironment of Junior high 
and high schools IS all too condUCive to 
every form of academiC dishonesty: 

rudents are impatient, class sizes are 
relatively large and teachers are over-
worked. 1111s breeds an envlronmem 
where rudents, whether they're acade-

di interest, and plagiarism is a thnlling 
and easy way to keep tho~e grades up 
(because morc emphasl~ is put on

dents who plagiarize are simple inno-

the conventional means - studYlOg

conventional way to meet this goal.

Work a dissapointment 
Procrastination always a possibility 

stop 
that! 
Bertrand Fan 

T here are two camps of people that graduate from college. There are 
the ones that tell you, "For the 
love of god stay in school, you 
don't know how easy you have it 
now, yadda yadda yadda." Then 
there is another set of people that 
strongly praise working over 
school, often referencing the lack 
of "bringing work home with 
you." 

Both of these people are full 
of shit. I can name a million 
thjngs better about school than 
work, and a million things better 
about work than school. And I 
can name a billion things better 
than both. 

Here's what I don't under-
stand: When you're in school, if 
you do absolutely nothing all 
day, you're a slacker; but the 
minute you graduate, you're a 
leech on society. Because the 
pretense of going to school is 
just so strong that doing nothing 
while you're in chool doe 
somehow manage to seem 
important. There were days 
where I filled up my gas tank, 
and that was my crowning 
achievement for the day. A hair-
cut, now that's just gOlllg all-out. 
Anything that requires twO 
showers in a single day deserves 
an award. 

People have been aylllg "You 
don't know how easy you have it 
now" my entire life. And I can 
afely say is that it didn't hold true 

for a lot of cases. High school? 
Give me a fucking break - wak-
ing up at 7 in the morning, 
mandatory c1as es, homework, 
busy work, public £ran ponation, 
SAT review clas es, the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, 
progress reports, parent-teacher 
conference and 3 lot of jerking 
off somewhere in the middle of all 
that. 

How in the hell was high 
chool supposed to be easier than 

college? Unless you're one of 

those overachievers, in which 
case you'd better swi tch over to 
the Wall Street JourrIIIl - I hear 
they have a good column on how 
to more effectively kiss President 
Bush's ass. 

I wrote a few things about high 
school when 1 was in high school, 
and every now and then I'll get a 
high school senior sending me a 
message or e-mailing me asking 
for advice about high school, 
which is damn funny to me. 
Considering if you knew me in 
high chool, I'd be the last person 
you'd be asking for advice about 
it. 

" I think the secret to 
work is going to the 

bathroom a lot. Every 
time I get bared, I just 

go to the ~oom and 
read design magazines 

far about a halfhour at 
a time. I figure my co' 

workers just think I have 
a bowel problem." 

But the general message I try 
to pass along to them is thi : "You 
don't know how hard you have it 
now." In less than four years, 
you'll be in college, and none of 
this will marter. Really, none of it. 
Even the people you really hate 
with every fiber of your body, 
you'll probably meet them ome-
day and have the kind of conversa-
tion you have with people that 
you went to high school with, 
which usually end with, "I'll give 
you a call sometime." And there is 
absolutely no exchange of phone 
numbers. 

But if you tnink college i 
easy, work, in some cases, is ea i-
er. Work is kind of a let-down. 
You know how up until college 
you were working toward going 

to college? Like everything you 
did, every test you studied for 
and every paper you stayed up 
until 5 a.m. for, were all collec· 
tively contributing to where and 
whether you went to college. But 
in college, it seems that every-
thing you're working for is to 
graduate and not necessarily 
toward a job. 1 mean, you're the-
oretically working toward 
becoming unemployed . 

I think the secret to work is 
going to the bathroom a lot. 
Every time I get bored, I just go 
to the bathroom and read design 
magazines for about a half-hour 
at a time. I figure my co-workers 
just think I have a bowel prob-
lem. 

Design magazines- are an inter-
esting substitute for porn. Every 
couple pages you get some artsy 
nude for absolutely no reason 
whatsoever. ( think psuedo-porn 
enthusiasts are a significant 
majority of their subscribers. And 
the other half are people that just 
don't know they're psuedo-porn 
enthusiasts. They say to them-
selves, "Self, I really like this 
design magazine, but I don't know 
why. It mUSt be the inventive and 
original way they take the pic-
tures." 

Here is the tradeoff - you 
get up about five hours earlier, 
but you never have to study. You 
get a paycheck every two weeks, 
but your parents aren't giving 
you any money. You have no 
homework, but you're too tired 
to do anything anyway. Your 
weekends are completely guilt-
free, but they pretty much always 
were. 

Weekends have some sort of 
new importance. It's almost like 
5 p.m. every Monday through 
Thur day are these little 
mirage, and Friday night is the 
oasis. And while it' true that 
there are no finals once you're in 
the workforce, there's not the 
feeling of relief after fini hing all 
your finals either. It's not better 
and it' not wor e: It's just differ-
ent.

War aftermath encourages 
backpedling, denial 

By DUSTI!' FRELICH 
Staff Writer 

The war in Iraq has been over 
for a few weeks now, and the debate 
over whether we should have gone 
to war has largely died down except 
for an extreme fringe of the 
American public who would protest 
anything Bush does. Before the war, 
there were those who made extreme 
predictions about what would hap-
pen as a resul t: It would be another

would rise up and defeat us; we 
would not see any

predicted problems to admit their 
error. 

The first such political pundit to 
admit his error did so in a gutsy 
way. It was Andy Rooney, of "60 
Minutes" fame, in his syndicated 
column, that did it in possibly the 
biggest way. "I watched the victory 
celebrations in Baghdad and have 
seldom in my life been 0 pleased 
to find I wa wrong," he wrote. "I 
did not think we should attack Iraq 
without the approval of the United 
Nations. The UN was wrong, I was 
wrong and George W. Bush was 

right. Forrunately, 
he's President and 
I am not."

sion would enrage 
the proverbial Arab 
"street;" terrorist 
attacks would 
increase, and so on. 

But now every-
one is debating a 
different story, and 
some are attempt-
ing to stick it to 
those outspoken 
cri tics tha t have got 
it so wrong in the 
pa t and continue 
to find themselves 
on the wrong side 
of history. Some are

Diana We t uccinctly worded 
the change in the ude when she 
wrote, "The most evocauve news

of Baghdad may be one of a young 
Iraqi man, dres ed in a derum jack-
et, holding a homemade poster cel-

well, that was my body double 
while I was on vacation." 

And Kristof also offers us a 
point-by-polOt wording of why he 
wa wrong: "Despite [what I wrote

he confessed. "Turkey h"s nOt

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Protesters' anger a bit 

misdireded 
Editor: 

So could one of you pro-war-
riors who claim so vehemently to 
support democracy, who are so 
hosti le toward France and other 
governments tha t opposed the 
invasion of Iraq, explain one thing 
to me? The majority of citizens in 
almost every nation in the world 
opposed our invasion of Iraq, that 
includes the majority of citizens in 
Great Britain, Spain , Italy and 
Australia . One would think that if 
you truly support the notion of 
democracy, your anger would be 

aimed at the mill ions of individual 
citizens who d isagreed with you, 
including those in Great Britain 
and Spain. Si mply because their 
government leaders choose to sup-
port President Bush, in defiance of 
their citizens' wishes, should not be 
the basis of whether your dismay is 
directed at an enti re country. 

In a democratic society, it's the 
citizens' views that count, but per-
haps you're too used to deferri ng to 
your own government leaders, 
right or wrong, as your basis for 
decision-making.

which UC officiall may can Ider 
allllpplicant's personQI q\lalirles In 
addition to academic merit when 
making admissions decisions at 
the university. 

After 1998, the enrollment of 
mmonty snJdents clecreased in all 
of the UC schools, and by more 
than SO percent t UC Berkeley 
and UCLA. 

In his opinion article titled 
"Not there yer," Atkinson ci ted 
evidence that the UC schools are 
having trouble with minority sru-
denu having the nee ary grades 
to qualify for UC admi ion. 

AccordIng to Atkl n on, 38 
percent of California public high 
5chool graduates and 21 percent 
of UC fres hmen in 1995 were 
underrepresented minority Stu-
dent . even year later, the sra-

tittics . how a widening of this gap 
from 17 to 24 percent, as only 18 
percent of minoriry tudenu were 
admitted to a UC .choolla t year. 

"What we mult do about this i. 
a source of real concern," 
Atkin on said. "We mu t continue 
our fforts to help clo e the 
achievement gap In the pllbll 
chools." 

Moreover, tkinmn said that 
IllQ r underrepresented minority 
tudents are fQlling to qualIfy for 

UC Qdmissions because o( the 
high chool grade pomt average 
and standardized telit scores 
requir d for entry. 

Many on campus beiteve that 
these two variables are the most 
fair and ju tifled factor and that 
only measure of intell igence 
should be used to determine UC 
admission. 

"Race and ethnicity is indepen-
de nt of in tell igence, motivation 
and heart ," said John Allison, co-
chair for the UCSD Con ervative 
Union. 

Currently, 30 percent of Asians 
and 13 percent of Caucasian grad-

uaring seniors in California quali-
fied for admission to a UC cam-
pu., while only 4 percent of 
Latino and 3 percent of blacks 
met these same standards. 

These numbers, however, can 
be misleading as UC group 
together multiple ethnicities and 
place them in one broader cate-
gory. The effect c n be misinter-
pretation of the stati tics. 

"Ethnicity is not blaele, white 
or ny color. Per ian, Spaniard 
and Norwegians re all included in 
the whIte label, but are not the 
same ethnicity," said UCSD 
Conservative Unton co-chair John 
Allison. "The number of ethnic 
groups that exist in California is 
large enough such that there is no 
ethnic majority.» 

Others, however, felt that 
Atkinson was talting advantage of 
the students and the UC school 
system by publicly expressing his 
view.

Abraham based his deCISion on 
an Apnl 26 report and recommen-
elmon made by Depu ' Energy 
Secretary Kyle McSlarrow and 

cting National Nuclear Security 
dministrator Linton F. Brooks. 

Brooks will be in charge of deter-

potential bids. 

The report said that although 

the untver ity wa ~Iow to re olve 
problem, its ub. equent actions 
ro that end were "broad, forceful, 
and effecttve." The report also 
recogmzed that the alleged IllJ -

the re ult of "the failure of a few." 

Of great concern to long-time 
workers at Lo Alamo, braham

THE UC D GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY I, 2003 

EAP: Students awarded two .. thirds credit 
continued from page I 

ing the cost and benefits of a 
student's decision to stay in or 
leave China . 

Students choosing to leave 
C hina without delay per 
University of California's request 
were promised to be awarded 
two-thirds credit for their 
coursework tha t semester pend-
ing final assignments, free health 
care in the United States for 90 
days and the shipping of belong-
ings back to the United States 
free of charge among other ben-
efits. Upon arrival in the United 
States, students were to contact 
their UC campus immediately 
regarding coursework. 

However, students were also 
presented with the option of 
staying in Beijing, but would 
have to withdraw from the 
University of California, forgo 
any UC financial aid or travel 
insurance and rely on the host 
university to award any credit. 

"Essentially, the students 
understand that by staying in 
China, they are withdrawing 
from the program, which, this 
particular semester, is their link 
to being enrolled in the 
University of California," Hanna 
said. "Effectively, they are disen-
rolling from the program by 
staying." 

One student, UC Santa Cruz 
undergraduate Eric Fong, decid-
ed not to leave Beijing, costing 
him his Stltus as a student of the 
University of California. 

Fang currently stars on the 

national television program 
"Sport English." According to 
UC Irvine undergraduate and 
EAP Beijing participant Nathan 
Jones, Fang decided to forgo his 
UC status because of promises he 
had made with the show's pro-
ducers about filming. Jones, who 
also starred in a national televi-
sion how in China, called 
"Mission Possible," was forced to 
make a decision between keeping 
his promise to his program's pro-
ducers or leaving the country at 
the request of EAP. 

Jones said that his decision to 
leave Beijing was less about 
remaining a University of 
California student as it was about 
the financial aid funding he 
would be forced to pay back if he 
were to be kicked out of the uni-
versity. 

"In the end, my decision was-
n't based on the threat that I'd be 
kicked out of UC, but the fact 
that I'd lose $7,000 to $8,000 in 
financial aid," Jones said . "They 
said I'd essentially have to pay 
back all of the financial aid I had 
received for the semester if I 
stayed." 

John Muir College J'unior 
Reid Barret, who had stu ied at 
Beijing Normal University 
before leaving on April 25, ssid 
the window of less than 24 houn 
to decide whether or not to leave 
made him feel "overly pres-
sured. " 

Barret and Jones both con-
tend that it was difficult to gath-
er information from the EAP 

directors regarding the pro-
gram's statu, as the SARS epi-
demic evolved in the month's 
leading up to the university'S 
decision to suspend the Beijing 
program. Further, the primary 
EAP director for Barret and 
Jones' group had been replaced 
in February by a professor emer-
itus from UC Berkeley, John 
Jameson. According to Barret, 
Jameson was traveling between 
Hong Kong and hanghai while 
directing, and would only spend 
a few days in Beijing every two to 
three weeks. 

Hanna says that Jameson was 
also involved with EAP in Hong 
Kong and that other UC officials 
were available for information in 
Beijing. 

According to UC officials, no 
EAP students have been diag-
nosed with SARS, a disease that 
has gained notoriety worldwide 
for its recent eJ[pansion through-
out EaST Asia. As of April 30, 
almost 1,500 cases of SARS had 

~n reported and about 9,000 
people have been quarantined 
because of the disease. 

Hanna said the University of 
California continues to monitor 
local conditions related to the 
SARS outbreaks in Vietnam, 
Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Taiwan, where EAP programs 
remain open. 

Since 1962, more than 40,000 
UC students havc enrolled in 
EAP. Currently, more than 4,000 
UC students are studying at 140 
institutions in 34 countries. 

Atkinson: 
UC targeting 
high schools 

for minorities 
conrmued fram pag 7 

plish is an infringement on tudent's 
rights," said Konstantinos Roditis, 
VIce chair Internal for mc College 
Rcpubllcans. "It IS disconcerting 
that the largest chool system in the 
U.S. would like to tUrn ml institu-
tion of hIgher learmng mto stage; 
for policcal propaganda ." 

But minority-labeling aside, the 
University of California has been 
trying to increase the enrollment of 
minority students by targeting cer-
tain high schools and offering mem 
aide with students and professional 
development programs. 

Over 97,000 students in 2001 
participated in UC-Ied student 
programs such as tutoring, college 
counseling and academic prepara-
Don. 

In addition, the UniverSIty of 
California also provided instruc-
lion to over 110,000 teachen Oil

'X2' doubles the action, halves the originality 
Many new characters, multiple plots crowd IX-Men' sequel 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

Part hokey pokey, part hocus pocus, "X2 : X-Men United" delivers two hours of comic 
book-style action dram a in similar 
fas hion ro the original. The main 
d ifference in the sequel is that 
"X2" do ubled th e ingredients 
fro m the film that gave birth to 
the comic boo k film craze in 
Hollywood . The recIpe wen t 
somethmg li ke thl ' tart with the 
old ca t of uperheroes and throw 
In a few new faces, take the num-
ber of plots in the prevIous fi lm 
and double them. "X2" was an 
appropnate title for the film In 
more ways than one. 

It IS difficult ro say what single 
task the X-Men need ro perform 
in order ro save the world in this 
film . The more efficient way of 
telling the story is to focus on the 
man trying to destroy the world 
(or at least the mutant popula-
tion). Stryker, a military scientist. 
began to hate the mutant race 
when Professor Xavier was unable 
to rehabilitate his son from his 
mutant ways long ago. 

The inability of Stryker's son to 
cope with his mutantism ultimately 
led to the destruction of his family 
and Stryker's insanity. As Stryker 
tries to destroy the mutants, 
Magneto attempts to destroy 
Stryker, and the human race while 
he is at it. It IS up to the X-Men to 
majntain peace and order here on 
Earth. 

In the midst of aU of this chaos, 
the most heavily developed subplot 

Film 
REVIEW 

comes by way of Wolverine learn-
ing of his origins, and doing battle 
with a female version of himself in 
the process. 

This film really aims to please 
the X-Men addicts and those who 
liked the first film . evenl intri-
cacIes throughout the film indi -
ca te It desire to please the true 
comic fa n, whde the star-studded 
cast tri es to pl ease the wider 
movIe gOIn g audience. T he film 
offe rs updates in the saga of each 
of the lives o f the X-Men and tries 
to accomplish roo much in a sin -
gle sitting. 

The whole film carne off feeling 
like some combination of a futuris-
tic epic myth and a soap opera in 
that it told and perpetuated a story 
that has no foreseeable end or res-
olution. Whatever cohesive the-
matic feel the filmmakers were try-
ing to create was diluted by the 
amount of screen time that has to 
be purely devoted to storytelling. 
This element kept the movie from 
being anything more than just 
good . 

The film scores big points in 
the area of visual effects, as the 
mutant's powers are pulled off 
stunningly. The best new addi-
tions come from the teenage 
mutants Pyro. Iceman and a 
cameo by Colossus. The filmmak-
ers made sure to keep the audience 
enchanted by the possibility of 

CouItesy oflOlh Cenlury Fox 
At the wheel: Famke Janssen and Halle Berry retum as Dr. Jean Grey and Storm, respedively, for "X2: X-Men United.· 

future sequels, which are report-
edly already in the planning 
stages. 

"X2" ultimately cashes in on 
America's love addiction with 
comics in the most prinUtive ways. 
Instead of building off of the fan-
tastic myth that has been the back-
bone of Marvel's success for so 
long. they ride on the laurels of a 
successful franchise and big name 
stars. 

The film saves face in that its 
pace, along with its big name stars 
and numerous explosions, keeps 
the audience constantly enter-
tained. The "Xl" filmmakers also 
deserve credit for going the dis-
tance in creating a two-hour film, 
whc:n they could have cashed in just 
as easily on an 80-minute story. 

Ultimately, "Xl" is just X-Men 
on steroids. and like many of the X-
Men characters, what it lacks in 

originality, it makes up for in pro-
portion.

ntURSDAY. MAY I . 200) THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS II 

From oddball 
filmmaker with love 

Madstone Theatres to release its new IFilm 
Forward' series, showcasing new talent 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

I t has been a travesty for film lovers nation-wide ro see their local movie theaters over-nm with formulaic, second-rate, commer-
cialized commodities known as movies, but 
Madsrone Theater is maktng an earnest 
attempt to remedy this situation with its new 
ix week film series "Film Forward." tarting 

on May I , the film senes features SIX unique 
films that won't be shown anywhere else. 

Many have heard of filmmakers like Justin 
Lin. dIrector of "Better Luck Tomorrow," who 
are lucky enough to get their films picked up 
by distributors after film festivals, but many 
filmmakers aren't so lucky. Their masterpieces 
and labors of love go on to the sad indie-ftlm 
abyss, or if they're lucky, to video-rental 
anonymity. Madstone Theaters, with its \0 
nationwide locations, is pioneering the "Film 
Forward" series to commercially debut the 
exciting films of promising filmmakers. With 
its emphasis on community and quality films, 
Madstone is trying to gather local support for 
these innovative new movies and save the 
dream of future aspiring moviemakers. 

"There have been a multitude of very fine 
films thar have never made their way into the-
aters, and by launching 'Film Forward,' 
Madstone is giving filmmakers and audiences a 
chance to discover each other and flourish -
minus the barriers that have long divided 
them," said Madstone 's Chief Executive 
Officer Chip Seelig. 

Instead of doing the safe thing and just car-
rying the next Hollywood blockbuster with the 
flashy effects and sexy stars. Madstone is taking 
a leap in showing these films. According to 
Seelig, "Madstones 'Film Forward' is dedicat-
ed to finding uncommoruy appealing films and 
giving them a chance to 6nd and grow audi-
ences outside the tradi tional system." 

Because these typeS of films aren't general-
ly available to the movie-going public, they go 
by unnoticed with moviegoers never even 
knowing that they exi t . With this and other 
attempts to bring more low-budget art and 
indie 6lms to its few locations, Madstone is 
giving these striving artists a chance they 
wouldn't have had otherwi.:e. 

From silly, off-beat romances to thought-
provolcing thrillers, the ftJms showcased at 
"Film Forward" are assuredly quality films that 
were chosen based on their new style, original-
ity, perspective and daring. They were aU cho-
sen for possessing these important qualities, 
yet they are not so unusual that viewers will be

alienated; adversely, they also appeal to more 
diverse audiences. 

The series starts with UTe Arno (Made in 
Chile) " and "Tattoo, A Love Story," which 
will be playing May 1 through May 14, with 
each film in the series playing two weeks. "Te 
Arno" stars Adrian Castilla, Daniela Ropert 
and Tamara Acosta and tells the story of four 
teens who build their own utopia in a con-
demned pavilion in Santiago. Chile. ThClr 
adventures, dramas, longings and fears are all 
magnified with an unrelenting camera . The 
perfect sununer vacation is interrupted with 
unforeseen and hidden troubles. For a lighter 
experience, "Tattoo, a Love Story" tells the 
story of Sara (Megan Edwards), a conservative 
young school teacher, who falls in love with 
one of her tudent's show-and-tell projects. a 
tattoo artist named Virgil (Vrrgil Mignanelli) . 
This unconventional love Stoty will touch your 
heart and make you think. There could be 
worse things than thinking after SeeiJlg a 
movie. 

"Soft for Digging" and "Bunny" are the 
next two films, both running May 15 to May 
28. "Soft for Digging" is a magni6cently shot

12 HIATIJ THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Better representation tomorrow 
New media takes on Asian-American experience 

By HANAHSU 
Senior Staff Writer 

Girl: "Who art you gllys?" 
Virgil: "Uh, a club. " 
Girl: "Oh, IIkt a math club or somt-
thmg?" 

I na way, these three simple hnes from Justin Lin's "Better Luck Tomorrow" peak to 
what the Asian-American experi-
ence is: a question, a half-hearted 
answer. Ask people what they 
think of depictions of Asian-
Americans in the mass media 
today, and the replies are telling. 

Wendy Hong, an Earl Warren 
College fifth year srudent, said, 
"The girls are bitches or smart 
goody-goodies, and the guys are 
either nice and friendly or gang-
sters - there's no one normal. n 

Sociology professor John 
Skrentny summed it up by saying, 
"I think they're mostly invisible ... 
but when they are there, they're 
depicted negatively." 

At the heart of the problem are 
historical forces: Asian-Americans 
have only recently gotten to repre-
sent themselves. Like African-
Americans, Asian-Americans were 
played by whites early on in the 
entertainment industry - instead 
of blackface, whites taped their 
eyes. But there is a difference in 
their histories of persecution, as lit-
erature professor Lisa Lowe pomts 
out. Afncan-Americ,ms, although 
enslaved and only considered CI ti-
zens In the early 19th century, were 
stili American; Asian-Americans, 
on the other hand, were seen as for-
eigners granted Cltlrenship around 

World War II. 
"[Thi] means the idea of 

Asians belonging or being 
American is relatively recent," 
Lowe said. "They are often 
between a rock and a hard place-
they must either assimilate and do 
well in legitimate social areas or 
swallow sense of distance and 
alienation ... 

Other believe that depictions 
have improved. Lucy Liu on "Ally 
McBeal," Keiko Agena on "The 
Gilmore Girls~ and Ming awen 
on "The Single Guy" and "ER," 
are examples of Asian-Americans 
in nonstereorypical roles. But 
those are all females, not males. In 
addition, for all their visibility, 
they are not leads - they're the 
best friend, the sidekick, the 
"Number One Son" to Charlie 
Chan. 

That's where Justin Lin's 
"Bener Luck Tomorrow" enters 
the picture. It is not an exaggera-
tion to call it a watershed film in a 
position to mae history: It is the 
first film with an all-Asian cast to be 
widely disrributed, to be officially 
selected at the Sundance Film 
Festival and bought by MTv. It not 
only breaks the curse of the inviSI-
ble or emasculated Asian-American 
male, but also explodes the model 
minority myth. 

Lee Ann Kim, a KGTV week-
end anchor and executive director 
and founder of the San Diego 
Asian-American Film Festival, 
sees "BLl'" as one of the most 
prorrusing films to break stereo-
types and glass ceiling : "[Lin] 
gave this awesome opporruniry ro 
tlus ca t. to show that they ... are 

good actors and they can be sexy 
and conrroversial and all the other 
things that [other] American 
actors are given the opporrunity 
to be." 

While the film continues to 
create conrroversy through its 
"negative" depictions, Justin Lin 
said, "I'm not crying to represent 
all Asian-Americans ... I think 
what's positive is to e~plore three-
dimensional human beings." 

So what is in store for tile 
future of Asian-Americans on 
screen? What are the remedies to 
the stereotypes? According to eth-
nic studies professor Yen Le 
Espiriru, the issue is as much 
about the numbers as of the qual-
ity of roles. 

Screenwriter, playwright and 
visiting UCLA lecrurer Weiko 
Lin (no relation to Justin) sees one 
solution as having more Asian-
American artists behi nd the 
scenes. 

"If you feel like there's not 
enough Asian-American roles, 
then learn to be a writer and write 
some. Go to film school, be the 
creatOr, be the people who make 
the decisions," Weiko Lin said. 

Justin Lin srresses the impor-
tance of community participation 
and discussion. 

"This is the same thing they 
were talking about [for] African-
Americans in the '80s. They were 
saying, 'this guy Denzel 
Washington, nobodys going to 
relate to a black man' ... [but] then 

pike Lee did,' he's Gotta Have 
it,' 'Do the Right Thing,' ... I

seems to be its own city, basically. I 
don't know if it has a mayor, but it 
definitely has some security force. 
We were doing one of the spy 
exchanges so I was dressed as this 
dodgy spy. This was before 9/\\ so 
there wasn't quite as much tension 
and paranoia, but there was clearly 
quite heightened security. 

They picked us up srraight 
away, and I was put in some weird 
little room on about the 80th floor 
of the Empire State Building for 
about half an hour by a guy who 
looked very like a Texas Ranger. It 

was very surreal.

that, to me, is great

As an engineer in 
the U.S. Air Force, 
there's no telling 
what 'you'll work on. 
(Seriously, we can't tell you.) 

United States Air Force applied 
technology is years ahead of what 
you'll touch in the private sector, and 
as a new engineer you'll likely be 
involved at the ground level of new and 
sometimes classified developments. 
You'll begin leading and managing 
within this highly respected group 
from day one. Find out what's waiting 
behind the scenes for you in the 
Air Force today. To request more

Film: Asian .. Americans still behind scenes 
coruinued /rom pap I' 

remember I asked [the .tudio.l. 
'where are the Asians?' and they 
.. id. 'Look. AsialU pump a lot of 
money into the econmny. but their 
spending patterns are elllcdy the 
.. me II Caucasians, 10 we cONider 
them Caueuian.' Believe me, when 
you go buy I ticket for 'Better Luck 
Tomorrow' they're keeping trICk. 
If enough Asians show up ... you'lI 
see more Asian representation on 
screen," he said. 

Kim believes that more vocal 
SlIppOrt and participation from 
Asian-Americans themselves is 
euential. "Asian Americans work 
very hard behind the scenes ... 
(thosel from the comp"ter graphics 
standpoints, or from an editing or 
directing standpoint, like John 
Woo and Ang Lee, have done well 

aRAB 
• c:oupon ... 

in Hollywood," Kim aid. wThe 
problem is for Asian-AmericaN on 
the screen ... they're muggling big 
time .till becaUle of the fact that 
our community docs not under-
stand the concept of going out and 
.upponinJ them." 

In addItion. Kim allO _ film 
festivab II an effective way of dis-
aeminating more varied and realis-
tic Asian-American depictiON. Her 
most gratifying momena are see-
ing Caucasian faces at the SDAFF 
and hearing the gratitude of fledg-
ling young Asiln-American film-
makers who would have given up if 
not for the support of film festivals. 

"Frankly, while we are the fastest 
growing ethnic grouP. we are still 
the smallest ... so we need help out-
side of our conununity to propel us 
to the mainstream. and I don't want 

people to think of it as an Asian 
thing; I want people: to think of it as 
a hwnan thing." Kim Did. 

JUitin Lin expressed his hope 
for future Asian-American fi lms. 

wlf we're always afraid of what 
people think of u •• then we're not 
being true to ouraelvcs ... Why 
should we live our lives any differ-
ent? BecaUle we have the right to 
be empowered Ind explore issues 
without agendas," he said. 

From Fu Mlnchu and Charlie 
Chan to female crime fighter and 
mi guided teens, we've come a long 
way, but there's tiil room for 
improvement. "Berter Luck 
Tomorrow," however. may open 
doors to wider pastures - or to 
echo Roger Fan as "Daric": "We 
don't have to play by the rules. We 
can make our own." .

Pfister and Johnny Perry. 
J was watching Perry'. qualify-

probably about the fifth time, but 
for the fint time, J IIW the laten 
that came on immediately after it 
was over: Johnny Perry, 1972-
2002. It hit me like one of thote 
final fingen had been dropped on 
my chest. Ths symbol of Strength 
and virility is dead. 

Ai [ walked back to my bed-
room to get dreued, I wondered 
what had happened. A few quick 
taps on the keyboard and I fOWld 
out: Johnny Perry died at age 30 of 
a heart attack that was caused by 
steroid usc. 

I call it a tragedy. The athletes 
in these strength events might call 
it a calculated risk. Tho/ve mort-
gaged a chance to kiss their grand-
children, to enloy social security 
and to grow gray gracefully for a 
chance to gel ahead now - for a 
chance to be the greate t. 

Only the most naive among us 
would believe that steroid u e i 
confi ned to the relativdy obscure 
realm of strength competitions. 
"Sports enter" i filled each night 
with guys who have gotten that 
extra edge at the drug store rather 
than the weight room, and they too 
must face the question: What's it 
worth to wi n? 

The quesoons we face as fans 
are nearly as daunting: Are we to 
blame here. too' By the demands 
we place for bigger and stronger 
athletes, and the way we glorify 
Winning, are we encouraging the 
next generation of )otlnny Perrys 
to take the same kind of risks? Are 
we prepa red to face the conse-
quences? 

Sports are all about pushing the 
human body to its limits, but Wtth 
an Olympian innocence - we 
often overlool.: that drugs can take 
the body beyond what it was 
deSigned to do - often at great 
cost in the long run. The greater 
the prize, the greater the risks will-
Ing to be taken and with the games 
we play having ever-increa ing 
rewards for those who excel, we can 
only expect the u e of perfor-
mance-enhancing substa nces to 
Increase. The questions of "To 
what end will this continue?", and 
"What risk is roo great?" are inher-
ently individual, but they must be 
a kcd lest we forget Johnny Perry's 
lesson for us.

uating this year, made solid plays 
throughout the entire weekend for 
UCSD, and the duo's performance 
in the final game was no exception. 
Both players threw and caught 
numerous scores, as well as playing 
strong defense. 

Lucas Mays, another senior,

" It was a tough weekend 
because we didn't play well," said 
UCSD head coach Dan O'Brien. 
"We needed to play solid baseball 
and we didn't. The team we played 
was beatable but we ended up 
beaong ourselves rather than hav-
ing Stanislaus come down to our 
place and beat us, which makes for 
a frustrating weekend." 

In game two of the doublehead-

finally put up a nurk in the wins 
column and beat CSU Stanislaus in 

extn innings. After the Warriors 
scored twict in the top of the sec-

"We mipt back our way into

team has the capability to play 
well should that happen."

THURSDAY, MAY 1,2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Men's crew competes in Newport 
Tritons prepare for this weekend's WIRA final 

By AMBEI MAllIN 
Staff Writer 

In preparation for the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association finals this comi ng 
weekend, Triton men's crew had 
one final meet on April 29, the 
Newport Invitational. Although 
varsity improved over their past 
meet, it was unable to row its way 
into the finals. The novice eight 
came in second only to Orange 
Coast Crew, the No. I freshman 
squad in Southern California . 

The Newport Invitational, 
held in Newport Harbor, included 
teams from UCLA, USC, UC 
Irvine, Loyola Marymount and 
Orange Coast College. The meet 
began with heats set up as a 
straight line to the finals, the 
equivalent to single elimination 
for crews. 

Varsity fell behind in the start 
of the 2,Ooo-meter race, but after 
500 meters, was able to keep the 
speed of the other crews. 

"Overall we had a better race 
than last week, bur it was not 
enough to get us into the finals," 
said. UCSD head coach Mike 
Filippone. "I love coaching this 
group, despite the setbacks. Every 
athlete comes to practice each day 
completely committed to going 
faster." 

For the first time since Eric 
Hardman's injury, the varsity team 
was able to pool irs individual 
strength and find consistent 
speed. 

"I am sticking with the lineup; 
it's my policy to build a team and 
let them gel together and find 
their speed," Filippone said. 

Filippone has decided to keep 
the varsity lineup and "concen-
trate on starts" throughout this 
week. This will help the team be 
more competitive off the line at 
WlRA. 

"I wa~ again impressed with 
the novice, they had a great per-
formance again," Filippone said. 

The novice team kept pace 

throughout the race and finished 
only three seconds behind Orange 
Coast, beating UCLA, UCI and 
USC. 

"Our goal at WlRA for the 
novice is to improve to beat 
Orange Coast. The novice squad 
has done an incredible job racing 
and gaining speed each week, 
which shows great promise for 
our future," Filippone said. 

This coming weekend, the 
UCSD crews head up to 
Sacramento to participate in the 
WIRAs. The boats are set, and 
will just be working on gelling and 
finding and improving their speed 
throughout the week. 

"We will be entering some new 
boats besides the traditional eights. 
We should get good speed out of a 
novice four, lightweight four and a 
varsity four," Filippone said. 

The novice lightweight four 
will also be one of the top con-
tending lineups of the weekend, 
maintaining the chance of being 
nationally ranked. 

Tennis: UCSD is confident about matchup 
conrinued from page 20 

coach Eric Steidlmayer. UCSD 
has also competed well in Division 
II despite having to play teams 
where the majority of the players 
are on athletic scholarships -
omething UCSD does not give. 

The Tritons will be facing a 
squad of foreign players, includ-
ing the No.7 singles player in the 
nation, Mikael Maatta from 
Sweden, who will most likely play 
at No. I singles against junior 
Sameer Chopra, whom Maana 
defeated in three sets last year. 

All are healthy on the UCSD 
team, and Steidlmayer will send 
out his usual starting lineup 
against the Sea Warriors. At No. I 
doubles will be Chopra pairing up 
with sophomore Bryan Swan. At 
No. 2 will be freshman Tommy 
Novak and his partner, junior Jeff 
Wilson. At No.3 will be a pair of 
seniors, captain Mike Meyer and 
Sean Nagel. In singles, Chopra 
will play at No. I, Meyer at No. 2, 
Swatt at No. 3, sophomore Emil 
Novak at No. 4, junior Blake 
Wilson-Hayden at No. 5 and 
Wilson at No. 6. 

Meyer, who says he's been play-
ing better the last few weeks and 
feels like his normal self after hav-
ing faced an injury last season, is 
looking forward to his singles 
match, most likely against Austrian 
Matey Pampulov. He has seen 
Pampulov play before and plans on 
beating him with his counterpunch 
and by outhitting him. 

The Tritons are looking to 
benefit from last year's match 
against the Sea Warriors. 

"My freshman year last year, I 
didn't have the best end of the 

season. But now I am a year more 
ready and a year more experi -
enced," Swatt aid. "We know 
[the Sea Warriors) going in .. . 
there will be no surprises. We 
have a lot of energy and we feel 
positive. We've been working 
hard all year for this match. We're 
really pumped." 

Before the match, the Tritons 
will have a couple of days of 
intense doubles practice and will 
be focusing more on match play. 

"We cannot afford to come out 
slow [in doubles]. Doubles are 
fairly even [against Hawaii 
Pacific) and will be huge because 
we have to take [at least] a 2-1 
lead," Meyer said. 

Playing at home is also a crucial 

advantage for the Tritons, who lost 
last year in Hawaii . agel says that 
not having the Hawaiian humidity 
and playing in San Diego weather 
are key aspects, which allow the 
ball to travel faster here. 

The Tritons are also hoping 
for a large, thunderous crowd to 
cheer them on and to perhaps 
intimidate their opponents. 

"I think it is very important to 
have the home court, especially if 
we can draw a large amount of fans. 
They definitely could be the differ-
ence for us," Steidl mayer said. 

Swan expressed a similar senti-
ment. 

"We're going to need the place 
packed," Swatt said. "Fan support 
is big. We need it."

Men's basketball 
will miss lone senior 

Injury kept Woods on the 
bench, but his presence was felt 

By AMBER MMTlN 
Staff Writer 

Although the UCSD mens bas-
ketbaU team will be losing only one 
senior this year, ]ody Woods, it will 
definitely feel the impact of this loss. 

"]ody was a good influence to 
have around the guys alI season," 
said UCSD head coach Bill 
Lanthier. 

Woods, who had shown amazing 
promise after his first season at 
UCSO, was out injured his senior 
year, but continued to be an active 
participant, watching games from 
the bench and cheering on his team-
mates during practice. 

"It was really unfortunate he was 
unable to play his senior year," 
Lanthier said. 

Woods transferred to UCSD 
from the College of the Desert in 
Des Moines, Iowa, for the 2001 -02 
season. 

During his first season with the 
Tritons, he led the team with 169 
total rebounds. He was aJso second 

in scoring, averaging 9.8 points per 
game, totaling 284 on the season . 

Even though a knee injury only 
allowed him to play in four games 
this season, Woods still oied to help

Athletics 

the Tritons any 
way he could . 

"He was 
always being 
funny, trying to 
keep guys 
loose. He would 
find a way to 
keep things in 
perspective. As 
one of the older 
members of the 
team, he was 
really a role 

model to the younger guys," said fe l-
low teammate Sean Crawford. 

Woods had a lasting influence on 
the team. 

"We are going to miss Jody," 
Lanthier said. It's not hard to under· 
stand why the team would miss 
Woods, who shot close to 50 percent 
in 2001-02 conference games. 

Softball: Triton defense 
makes up for weak bats 
continued from page 20 

bringing her record down to 9-8 on 
the season. UCSD was able to get 
five hits, including two from Hurst 
and junior Amy Mettee, despite not 
being able to bring in a run. 

"Our defense was really so-ong," 
Gerckens said. "We had a lot of 
offensive opportunities but we just 
couldn't score. " 

In the third game of the tourney, 
the Tritons pulJed off a 5-2 victory 
against San Francisco State from 
behind an eight inning perfonnance 
by Hanley, which brought her 
record up to 7-11 on the season. 
While the bats were slow for 
UCSD, they managed to tie the 
game at two in the seventh inning, 
and scored three in the eighth to 
take the victory. 

"It took a while for our bats to 
come alive, but it was much better 
lare than never," Gerckens said. 

The fourth game for UCSD was 
against UC Davis. The match 
resulted in a 4-0 Triton setback, with 
the loss going to Kurz, her ninth of 
the season. The Tritons were only 
able to muster two hits, one from 
Hurst and one from Mettee. 

"Our bats really quieted down," 
Gerckens said. "Davis is a great hit-
ting team; they hit the ball alI over 
the place. no matter where we 
pitched it" 

The final game of the Classic was 
a low note for the Tritons, who fin-
ished with a 9-1 mercy rule defeat at 
the hands of CSU Bakersfield. 
Junior J odie Bland took the loss, 
putting her record at 5-7 on the sea-
son. Hurst scored UCSOS lone nul . 

"Bakersfield has won nine of 
their last 10 games, and I thi nk 
they're the best team in our region 
right now," Gerckens said. "No mat-
ter who we pitched, they hit us." 

After the Mountain Dew Classic, 
UCSD played a doubleheader 
against San Francisco State, winning 
both games by scores of 4-0 and 3 -0, 
respectively. Kurz (10-9) and Hanley 
(8- 11) earned the respective pitching 
victories. 

In the first game, Mettee went 2-
for-4 with two runs and an RBI, 
while Bland went 2-for·3 . ln the sec-
ond game, Cope went 2-for-J with a 
home run, which was her third of the 
year, and junior Kim Aggabao went 
2-for-2 . 

"We had a couple key wins," 
Gerckens said. "We could've been 
tired from the tournament, but we 
were playing for pride. an 
Francisco has a high team batting 
average, so hutting them out was 
impressive." 

The Tritons finaJ four games o f 
the season take place on May 2 and 
May 3, with two games each against

momentum," according to 

ander . After letting in one 
more "garbage" goal , UC D's 
defense set in to shut out and 
fru trate the Aggies for the 
remainder of the match. 

Tucker and Keesey were 
top scorers once again, along 
with Meri Bantilan- mith, 
with twO goals each.

goals on the scoreboard in the

LMU edges UCSD in WWPAs Triton baseball loses 
final league series 

UCSD drops into fifth place; 
playoffs are unlikely now 

Women's water polo falls just short of title 
Iy DANIEL DW

New York Yankees, Detroit 
Red Wings, Duke basketball ... 
you can add Loyola Marymount 
women 's water polo to the list of 
perennial parry poopers; the 
teams that everyone loves to 
hate. 

For the second consecutive 
year, the UCSD women's water 
polo team had their ational 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Final Four hopes dashed by the 
Lions of LM in the Western 
Water Polo Association champi-
onship game, on April 27 in 
Bakersfield, Calif.; a five-goal 

first quarter proved to be decisive 
in the 8-6 loss. 

UCSD finished the 2003 sea-
son with a 23-14 overall record. 

Despite the second-place fin-
ish in the WWPA and top-notch 
tournament victories over CSU 
San Bernardino and heated rival 
UC Davis, coming home again 
without a championship trophy 
proved to be a little hard to swal-
low for the Tritons. 

"We're disappointed with the 
loss," said UC D head coach 
Larry Sanders after the LMU 
game. "We've worked hard to 
come this far, and to not finish it 
off ... it's frustrating. We expect 
to win a conference champi -

onship every year." 
The road to the champi-

onship game began with an 11-5 
tournament-opening victory 
over CSU San Bernardino on 
April 25 . The Tritons charged 
right out of the gate, taking 
advantage of all scoring opportu-
nities to start the game with a 4-
o run before the Coyotes got one 
by the UCSD defense at the end 
of the first quarter. UCSD 
rammed three goals into the San 
Bernardino cage in the second 
period, meanwhile allowing only 
one more goal, which gave the 
Tritons a 7-2 lead. UC D added 
four more scores in the third 
before sending in the subs. San 
Bernardino hit three consolation 
goals in the half. UCSD's 
Elizabeth Kee ey and Dana 
Tucker led the coring with a hat 
trick each. 

"We jumped out early those 
first two quarters, scoring goals 
and shutti ng [San Bernardino) 
down. We dictated the tempo of 
the game," anders said . 

The next day proved success-
ful once again for the Tritons as 
they downed rival UC Davis by a 
core of 6-5 in the semifi nal on 

April 26.

After 10 ing three of four games

After a first-period draw, 
UCSD lit up the scoreboard 
three times in the second period 
to take a 4-1 lead at the half. 
Before things could be consid-
ered safe, however, the Aggies 
came back with two goals of their 
own to cut the UCSD lead to 
one. The Tritons scored two 

The Warriors took the opener 
with ease, beating the Tritons 9-5. 
UCSD jumped out to a two-run lead 
in the bottom of the first inning when 
Triton third baseman Matt Merrifield 
knocked in his first home run of the 
season, a two-run shot to left-center 

field, to put U SD on the board. 
Stani laus retaliated and put up single 
runs in each of the fourth, fifth and 
sixth innings, to go ahead. Then in 
the seventh, the Warrior put lip five 
runs on three hits to clinch the first 
victory after the first five batter of 
the inning reached base. UCSD put 
up three runs in the seventh to 
counter Stanislaus' power, when 
catcher Matt Kenni on smack.ed a 
three-run home run to left field, plat-
ing right fielder Brett Burton and sec-
ond baseman Nigel Miller, who had 
both singled through the right side.

H ave you ever thought about what it's worth to wm? Is It worth hard 
work' Blood? Sweat' Tears' Is It 
worth losing years off your life? 

As far as I'm concerned, there 
are only two channels on our TV: 
ESPN and ESPN2. I was watching 
the latter on one of those days 
where it gets to be early afternoon 
before you realize that you're still 
wearing your pajamas and that 
you've accomplished nothing all 
day except to put a sizable impres-
sion of your butt in the couch. 
That's when one of those world 's 
strongest man competitions came 
on. 

I must admit, I'm a sucker for 
these things. There's something 
about watching huge men pull 
semis uphi ll and toss around 100-
pound weights like they're toys 
that pulls me in. Beyond that, these 
strongmen have such great names: 
Svend Karlsen, Magnus 
Samuelsson, Janne Vinanen, and 
the great American hopes, Phil
