UCSD students gathered

the fight against Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
(A.I.D.s.). 

Members of Community 
Advocates for Disability Rights

joining hundreds of volunteers, 
participants and corporate 
sponsors at the tOth Annual 
San Diego AIDS Fun Run &

The UCSD groups raised 
money through donations or 

pledges before the event, and 
then participated in either a 5-

UCAB to 
Hold Vote 
Online 
ELECTION: Students will 
decide on measure via 
Studentlink website 
By JEFFREY M, BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

A measure to expa nd the 
Student and Price Centers that 
failed to garner enough student 
votes to pass las t quarter will be 
revived Oct. 25-28 in an online 
vote. 

The University Centers 
Advisory Board (UCAB) has 
organized an election through 
Studentlink, hoping to pass a $25 
per quarter increase to the stu-
dent centers fee. The increase 
would fund a $12 million expan-
sion of UCSD's student center 
and $250,000 in repairs to the 
building that houses the Che 
Cafe. 

While too few students cast 
votes last spri ng to pass the mea-
su re, 55 percent of those voting 
favored expa nsion . 

UCAB hopes online capabili-
ties will encourage more students 
to vote.

UCSD Offers Business Certificate 
OPTION: New undergraduate program is based on suggestions given by San Diego's leading employers 
By KENDRA WElNISCH 
Staff Writer 

This fall, UCSD will increase 
the educational options of stu-
dents considering careers in 
business-related fields by offer-
ing an Undergraduate Certificate 
in Business for the first time. The 
business program will consist of 
a series of classes designed to 
prepare graduating students for 
careers in the business world. 

The program, which is exclu-
sively open to full-time juniors 

and seniors, is a joint effort of 
Academic and Student Affairs. 
Its curriculum is based on sug-
gestions given by San Diego's 
leading employers when asked 
what they value in recent college 
graduates. 

The certificate and its affiliat-
ed courses are partly in response 
to a 1998 survey of local employ-
ers and UCSD graduates, which 
found that "although UCSD 
graduates are prized for their 
superior academic abilities, they 
usually do not possess compara-

ble strengths in understanding 
the challenges facing business 
today, or in practical skills that 
can be applied to solving busi-
ness problems." 

Interpersonal skills, speech, 
teamwork and leadership, as 
well as other skills that enhance 
the value of an employee in an 
office situation, were all men-
tioned by those polled as areas 
that graduates should improve 
before entering the work force. 

In order to receive the UCSD 
Undergraduate Certificate in 

Business a student must com-
"plete seven specified courses 
before graduation: four under-
graduate campus courses and 
three UCSD Extension non-
degree courses. The topics of 
these courses range from the 
b~iness life cycle to forms of 
business ownership and compe-
tition in global markets. 

Last spring, UCSD Extension ' 
offered an "Introduction to 
Business" course on a test basis.

Blindness Victims Promote Awareness 
RALLY: Over 2,000 people gathered in Balboa Park Saturday morning 
By LEENA SHANKAR 
Senior Staff Writer 

To promote recognition of elderly people 
with macular degeneration, UCSD Shiley 
Eye Center, in conjunction with the World 
Health Organization and San Diego County, 
hosted a rally in Balboa Park last Saturday. 

Macular degeneration is the leading cause 
of irreversible blindness in seniors and 
results in loss of central vision. 

The goal of the event, which attracted 
over 2,000 attendants, was to increase aware-

ness of macular degeneration and to encour-
age local leaders to adopt policies designed 
to improve the quality of life for those with 
this disease. 

"This is a very unique event because it is 
the first time that people with macular 
degeneration have come together," Stuart 
Brown, chairman of and professor in the 
UCSD School of Medicine department of 
opthamology, said. "Six percent of our coun-
try may be suffering from macular degenera-

UCSD Loses Director 
Robert Wielage 
OBn'UARY:FD&C 
leader retired in June 
after 10 years of work 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Robert e. Wielage, director of 
architecture and project manage-
ment in Facilities Design .and 
Construction (FD&C), died Sept. 
17 due to heart failure. He was 70. 

M. Boone Hellmann, assistant 
vice chancellor and campus a rchi-

that Wielage drove the contractor 
to finish the project by fall of 
1995. Hellmann said that when a 
water line broke, causing $1.5 
million damage to the Geisel 
Library, Wielage came out to the 
site when he was supposed to be 
on vacation and later put together 
the insurance claim to recover 
damages for the university. 

Hellmann said that as a work-
ing colleague of Wielage, he 
found Wielage fun to work with 
for 10 years. 

"He was a character," 
Hellmann said . 
"He was described described Wielage 

as an "exceptional-
ly capable guy." 

Wielage joined 
the university in 
June of 1989 and 
retired in June of 
this year. During 
his time at the uni-
versi ty, Wielage

Hellmann said . "A lot of what 
we call gray hair experience in 
terms of the professional indus-
try." 

Hellmann said that the com-
pletion of Library Walk was one 
of Wielage's most notable contri-
butions to the campus. He said 

Wielage, whose wife died last 
December after a long illness, is 
survived by two sons and a

A campus memorial service 
was held for Wielage Sept. 21 .

A.S. Council to Disburse Grant 
DIVERSITY: UCOP money has remained unused for the last two years 
By MELODY GONZALES 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council will distrib-
ute nearly $20,000 this academic 
year to help subsidize outreach 
efforts initiated by student orga-
nizations and individual students 
atUCSD. 

Since 1997, the University of 
California Office of the President 
(UCOP) has given each university 
in the University of California 
(UC) system a $10,000 annual 
grant intended for student out-
reach programs. For the past 
three years, UCSD's grant money 
has accumulated, rolled over and 
remained untouched by any cam-
pus outreach programs. 

Beginning this fall quarter, stu-
dent organizations or individuals 
can seek funding for outreach 

r.
rograms from the Student-
nitiated Outreach and 

Recruitment Committee (SIORC). 
.StORC (pronounced "source") is 
the newly created A.s. committee 
designed to distribute UCOP's 
outreach grant. 

Because admissions policies 
no longer take race into account, 
other steps, such as the UCOP 
grant, are being taken in order to 
ensure that the decrease in uni-
versity diversity does not contin-
ue. 

UCOP's grant is an attempt to 
increase diversity in higher edu-
cation by increasing UC students' 

outreach efforts, which in turn 
should increase the number of 
disadvantaged students who 
qualify for college. The hope is 
that the grant wilT allow more UC 
stude!,ts to.work with elementary 
and secondary schools to chal-
lenge, motivate, prepare and 
guide students of diverse back-
grounds toward higher educa-
tion. But at UCSD, the benefits of 
this grant remain yet to be seen. 

In 1997, the first $10,000 dis-
bursement of the UCOP outreach 
grant was placed under the con-
trol of the Center for Research in 
Educational Equity Assessment 
and Teaching Excellence 
(C.R.E.A.T.E.), but the money was 
n9t distributed to any campus 
outreach programs. 

The following year, the 
responsibility of the UCOP grant 
was shifted to the A. S. Council, 
but again the grant money was 
not disbursed. 

1998-99 A.S. Vice President 
Finance Pat Ru said the grant 
was not given to any campus out-
reach programs because a 
process of determining how the 
money should be allocated did 
not exist. 

"You don't just want to throw 
it out for the cotlvenience of hav-
ing it out there," Ru said . 

Before the money could be dis-
tributed, Ru and other members 
of the UCSD student body felt it 
was necessary to create a specific 

process for groups or individuals 
interested in obtaining outreach 
funding. 

Ru, as well as other students 
involved with the grant, spent the 
year trying to create a disburse-
ment process and seeking further 
advice from the general student 
population. Although many stu-
dents sent e-mails expressing an 
interest in receiving the money, 
very few were interested in devel-
oping the disbursement process. 
Ru said·.Jhat those students that 
took the initiative to offer their 
opinions were instrumental to the 
development of SIORe. 

The grant will be under stu-
dent control and will be distrib-
uted by the SIORC committee 
without any administrative inter-
vention. The committee, com-
prised of nine student members, 
will be overseen by the current 
A.S. Vice President Finance, Eric 
Rovner. 

Rovner and SIORC members 
will review each request for out-
reach funding, conduct hearings 
to clarify each proposal and will 
collaboratively determine the 
amount of grant money to be 
given to qualified projects. 

Eligibility for outreach fund-
ing is limited to programs, activi-
ties and services which focus on 
outreach to students in grades K-
12 and community colleges. The

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, October 4, 1999 

PINION 
The Internet has changed the way we listen music; soon it will change how we watch television and movies 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

Once upon a time the printed word 
was the only form of media . The course 
of human technological advancement 
introduced other forms of media, each of 
which supplanted its predecessors to 
become the most popular form of media. 
Phonograph players introduced audio to 
the masses and suddenly made 'print 
seem a little boring; radio came along 
and replaced newspapers and records as 
the preferred source of news and music; 
and television usurped radio's role as 
the king of media . 

Now the Internet has come, and is 
steamrolling everything. 

As usual, entrenched institutions that 
have relied on older forms of media have 
been a little too slow to react. Just as the 
radio broadcast networks failed to com-
prehend the threat that the advent of 
television posed, traditional media 
providers have been slow to realize the 
pOSSibilities, not to mention the competi-
tion, that the Internet offers. And they 
have suffered for it. 

The most visible upheaval, and one 
that is still well under way, is the one 
that is shaking up the music industry. 
The combination of advances in person-
al computers and data transfer has 
proven ripe for the distribution of music 
over the Internet. 

The most popular format for distrib-
uting songs among computer users is 
MP3. A little while after this standard 
was introduced the major record labels 
took a look at it and decided that it was-
n' t practical. They felt that it was too dif-
ficult to enforce copyright protection, 
that the files were too large to transfer 
practically over telephone lines and that 
consumers would prefer the higher qual-
ity of sou nd afforded by audio CDs. So 
they elected to ignore it. 

Whoops. 
Now MP3s are firmly entrenched as 

the most popular feature of the Internet, 
recently beating out pornography as the 
most sought con tent on the major search 
!?ngines. 

A slew of consumer electronic 
products that play MPJ~ IIU;:C.II """ 
digital music is no longer restricted 
to computers. 

Internet companies that pro-
vide MP3s like MP3.com and 
eMusic are booming. And the 

same record labels that blew off this 
"impractical" form of media are scram-
bling to cut their losses from pirated 
songs and artists who are defecting to 
the Internet camp. 

The full effects of this coup probably 
won't be known for several years. The 
major record labels will most likely sur-
vive now that they've gotten the hint 
and are starting to grapple with this new 
media, just like ABC,CBS and NBC sur-
vived the transition from radio to televi-
sion. But just like their predecessors, 
they left the door open long enough for 

either; resourceful pirates manage to get 
feature films while they are still in the 
theater. Most times these are rather low-
quality copies shot with handicams that 
have been smuggled into .theaters, but if 
someone can get their hands on a film 
reel and some professional video equip-
ment they can create commercial quality 
copies, ready for illegal distribution on 
the Internet. 

Movie distribution companies and 
television networks have yet to offer any 
comparable service to consumers. The 
lesson that they should have learned 

The next major revolution will probably center around video, both 
television and feature films. The pirates, who always seem to be the 
pioneers when it comes to the Internet, are already plying the 
electronic seas and plundering what booty they can. 

several competitors f<1 slip in and estab-
lish a considerable name for themselves. 

But even while the battle over 
Internet music rages, the stage for yet 
another battle is already being set, and it 
seems that the reigning kings are once 
again largely unaware of the invaders 
assembling outside their doors. 

The next major revolution will proba-
bly center around video, both television 
and feature films . The pirates, who 
always seem to be the pioneers when it 
comes to the Internet, are already plying 
the j:lectronic seas and plundering what 
booty they can. 

For some time now it has been possi-
ble to download television episodes and 
even entire movies and play them back 
on a personal computer, or write them to 
a CD or DVD and play them back in a 
home theater. 

This isn't limited to movies that have 
been released on videocassette or DVD 

from the music revolution is that if there 
is sufficient demand for digital media, it 
doesn't matter if the industry refuses to 
supply it, people will find a way to get it 
anyway. It only remains to be seen 

whet~er or not these people will pay for 
it. And if another company finds a way 
to supply it, the reigning companies will 
be left in the dust. . 

The flagship of Internet video right 
now is the webcast, which is just a lame 
simulacrum of a television broadcast 
that doesn't take advantage of the 
Internet's ability to provide access to 
media at the ClJnsumer's convenience. 

Users tune into a webcast much like 
they would any ordinary television pro-
gram, ex(~ept for most users the picture is 
rather small and the sound is pretty 
crappy. 

Companies need to stop trying to 
reproduce conventional television on 
co"-,puters and instead utilize the unique 

features that the Internet offers. 
So what needs to be done? Quite 

frankly, I don't care if the movie and tele-
visi.on industries do get bit in the ass; it 
serves them right for being shortsighted 
and dragging their feet. But someone 
needs to get with it and start taking 
advantage of this new market before it 
gets overrun by pirates once again. This 
means offering some form of video on 
demand for consumers. 

Right now high-end computers with 
high-speed connections can stream full-
SCTeel\, full-motion video with audio and 
picture quality fairly comparable to tele-
vision in real time. The software required 
to serve and play this video is available 
for free from several companies. 

Although the number of end users 
who can take advantage of this technolo-
gy is relatively smaJl at the moment, this 
was also true when MP3s were first intro-
duced, but they quickly grew to become 
a major market. 

Advances in personal computers and 
high-speed service providers show no 
signs of slowing, so it is safe to assume 
trutn in a year or so there will be a 
respectable portion of the market that 
win be capable of downloading and 
watching full screen video on a comput-
er. These people will be capable of down-
loading for later playback or streaming 
live television programs, music videos 
and movies any time they want to watch 
them. If there is no legitimate service that 
can provide these, some of them will tum 
to pirate servers to access these programs 
illegally. 

This revblution doesn't need to be 
restricted to computers either. Just as 
portable MP3 players nave released 
Internet music on the world at large, an 
enterprising electronics compa!1Y can 
bring Internet video to the home theater. 
Already, companies like ReplayTV and 
TiVo have created products that can 
encode television programs into digital

Student Aid Needs More Funding 
COMMENTARY: Trend of declining federal financial aid for college needs to be reversed 
By NOAH GREER 
CALPIRG Chapter Chair 

It is no secret that attaining a 
college degree is a critical, first 
step toward success. Whatever 
one's economic background, 
going to college can open doors 
to a better life. 

For years the federal govern-
ment played an important role 
in opening these doors. 

~inning 50 years ago with the 
GJ Bill of Rights, federal stu-
dent aid has made college a pos-
sibility for people of all back-
grounds. 

Federal funding benefits both 
individual students and the 
entire nallon. It is estimated that 
increases in national education 
have accounted for almost 30 
percent of the growth in national 
income this century. Because 
they earn more, save more and 
are unemployed less often, col-
lege graduates make fewer 
demands on the public purse 
and pay more taxes. When the 
federal government helps stu-
dents attend college, it is an 
investment in our nation's 
future. 

Unfortunately, federal fund-
ing for student aid has failed to 
keep pace with inflation and ris-
ing college costs. As a result, it 
has become increasingly difficult 
to afford a college degree. In 
order to pay ' for college, many 
students are now forced to take 
out massive student loans. 
While loans accounted for just 
20 percent of federal assistance 
in 1976, they accounted for near-
ly 75 percent of assistance in 
1996. 

For many students, the finan-

cia I burden of attending college 
is significant enough to prevent 
them from completing their edu-
cation. Others never even apply. 

This trend hits young adults 
from low-income backgrounds 
the hardest. In ]996 young adults 
from the poorest 25 percent of 
American families had a mere 5 
percent chance of completing a 
baccalaureate degree by the age 

It is estimated that 
increases in national 
education have 
accounted for almost 30 
percent of the growth in 
national income this 
century. Because they 
earn more, save more, 
and are unemployed less 
often, college graduates 
make fewer demands' on 
the public purse and pay 
more taxes. 

of 24. 
It wasn't always like this . 

Twenty years ago feder<fl student 
aid programs gave students in 
need enough grant aid to pay for 
college without getting buried in 
debt. 

The Pell Grant is a good 
example. The largest of student 
aid programs, the Pell Grant cur-
rently supports over 3.7 'llillion 
students in their educational 
endeavors. 

In the late ] 9705 the maxi-
mum Pell Grant for which a stu-
dent could qualify paid for three 
quarters of the average cost of 

attending a four-year public uni-
versity and one third of the cost 
of a private university. Due to 
poor funding over the interven-
ing years those figures have 
dropped significantly. 

Today th~ maximum Pell 
Grant pays for only one third of 
the average cost of attendance at 
a public university and one sev-
enth the cost of a private univer-
sity. The maximum award is now 
worth just 86 percent of its 1980 
value in constant dollars (not 
adjusted for inflation). 

It doesn't have to be this way. 
With the federal government 
moving into an era of budget sur-
pluses there is no reason why 
Congress shouldn't give student 
aid the funding increase it needs. 

Unfortunately, reason often 
seems a scarce resource in poli-
tics. In its absence, public pres-
sure is necessary to ensure that 
our elected officials make 
expanding access to higher edu-
cation a federal priority. Take the 
time to let your elected officials 
know how you feel. 

Public pressure has worked in 
the past. In 1995, when Cvngress 
was considering slashing student 
aid funding, a massive public 
outcry prompted elected officials 
to replace the proposed cuts with 
significant increases in the Pell 
Grant and other student aid pro-
grams. Nonetheless, Congress 
must go even further to recover 
lost ground. 

Contact Representative Susan 
Davis, Senators Barbara Boxer 
and Diane Feinstein and urge 
them to support a $400 increase 
in the maximum Pell Grant 
award. Tell them that student aid 
must be a federal priority and

video to be stored and replayed 
later. It wouldn't take a giant leap 
of imagination to add a network 
card to one of these devices to 
give them the ability to dowf)load 
programs on demand. 

Imagine the true pay for view 
programming that the Internet 
can provide: When you want to 
watch a movie, you order it from 
a pay-per-view service, and your 
computer or set-top-box starts 
playing it right now. 

You miss the season premiere 
of your favorite TV show and you 
forgot to record it, so you just 
order the show from your cable 
or video provider and it starts 
playing whenever you have time. 

You want to watch a new 
music video but you don't want 
to sit around for hours on end 
watching all the boring pop 
music that MTV is playing, so 
you order the video you want 
and you can watch it without 
having to suffer through all the 
videos you don't like. 

Streaming video is going to 
change entertainment forever, but 
none of the major corporations 
are giving it the attention it 
deserves. 

Once again, the prize is up for 
grabs. Television and movie com-
panies can ignore the capabilities 
of the Internet, denying digital 
video to honest consumers while 
pirates enjoy them and profit 
from them ilIegall. Or they can 
get their act together and get rich. 
They had better act quiCk. too, 
because the moment of truth is 
fast approaching, whether or not 
they want to admit it.

Adventures in TJ Land: Through the Border Check . 
COMMENTARY: A little bit of common sense can help prevent suffering and unwanted headaches south of the border 

jL;~ . S/uP 77Ju/! :- BERTRAND AN 
When I was in high school, I 

took a course called world history. 
It wasn't a very good course, but I 
do distinctly remember a political 
cartoon in our book about Mexico. 

The first cell showed a rich, fat 
dictator smoking a huge cigar 
and exploiting the "\"sses. The 
next cell showed an uprising with 
a charismatic leader rallying a 
revolution. The dictator promptly 
runs away with all the money 
and the revolutionary leader 
replaces him. Then he in turn 
becomes a rich, fat dictator, 
another uprising occurs, and he 
runs away with all the money. 

I found the cartoon to be only 
mildly amusing at the time, but 
after my most recent experience 
in Tijuana, I laugh my ass off 
whenever I think about it. 

Tijuana is corrupt. You may 
think Las Vegas is a bit of a payoff 
town, but TJ is the creme de la 
creme. Everybody'S in on the take: 
taxi drivers, club owners, bar-
tenders, thugs, bums, muggers, 
prostitutes and cops. The degree to 
which this is true can only be truly 
appreciated after first-hand experi-
ence, but I'll do my best to try and 
explain it to you. 

No matter who calls you 
"amigo", they're not your friend . 
The only people you can trust in 
Tijuana are the people that you go 
in with and your fellow party-
goers. Everyone else either wants 
to relieve you of your money or 
take advantage of you some how.

Lastly, set aside enough 
money for the club and two taxi 
rides (-$20), and divide that up in 
your pockets as well. Leave your 
wallet at home. 

Your wardrobe also needs care-
ful consideration. Your first 
instinct might be to put on your 
favorite party clothes, but you 
have to remember that people will 
be spilling beer all over them. 
Don't wear your favorite shoes 
because when you see them the 
next day, they'll suddenly be your 
least favorite shoes due to having 
been soaked in unmentionable liq-
uids from the club floors. Besides, 
no one in a TJ club could see your 
shoes even if they wanted to. 

Negotiate taxi fares and desti-
nations before you get into them, 
and tip the bartenders before you 
get your drinks. You'll find that 
most drinks in TJ don't usually 
contain the same ingredients as 
their counterparts in the United 
States. For example, a gin and tonic 
in the United States becomes a 
vodka tonic in TJ. A rum and coke 
becomes a vodka and coke. A pii'la 
colada no longer contains rum, but 
does have a distinctive taste of 
Popov to it. So, will tipping your 
bartender change any of that dras-
tically? Not really, but at least your 
drinks won't be completely 
watered down. 

Going to TJ is quite different 
from most other activities available 
on a Wednesday night. As one of 
the people that tried to mug me so 
eloquently put it, "You're in our 
country now, mother-~r." 

If you get anything out of the 
evening more than a random 
hookup and a hangover, it'll be a 
newfound appreciation for U.S. 
police officers.

Population Problem Demands Action Salaries Should Not

By nMOTHY CL1NE 
Director of Communications 
Zero Population Growth 

What is Y6B? Y6B will be one 
of the most momentous occa-
sions in human history. And it's 
right around the corner - liter-
ally. On October 12, the world's 
population will reach 6 billion 
people. 

Sure, everyone should be 
concerned about the technologi-
cal challenge of Y2K. But we 
have a much more urgent prob-
lem staring us in the face. Y6B 
presents everyone with an enor-
mous opportunity to address 
and change our quality of life, 
and the lives of the rest of the 
world's population. 

Today Y6B is our biggest 
challenge, and we need to take 
notice now. 

The numbers speak for them-
selves. By any standard, 6 billion 
is a lot of people. But the more 
important issue is how individual 
and collective quality of life issues 
can be magnified by the rapid 
population growth of the world.

almost 275 million, is the third

swelling ranks of unemployed

COMMENTARY: Money isn't everything 
By MICHELLE PAN NOR 
UC Regent 
Special to the Guardian 

At last week's regents meet-
ing, the bO<1rd approved an 8.5 
percent increase in the salaries of 
275 senior administrators, includ-
ing all ten chancellors of the 
University of California . The 
total cost to augment the salaries 
is $2.5 million . 

The yearly sa lary of the UC 
president is now $337,300, well 
above the yearly salary of the U.S. 
president, who makes $200,000 
and the California governor, who 
makes $141,935. ' 

The rationale given for the 
salary increase was that we must 
remain competitive. If we want 
to have the best administrators 
working for the University of 
California, we must increase their 
sa laries. The nine chancellors of 
the University of California 
trailed the market in salaries by 
17 percent when compared to 
chancellors from 26 similar insti-
tutions this year. 

I voted against the salary 

• 

increase because I do not believe 
that this is the best use of stu-
dents' and taxpayer's' money. I 
also do not believe that top-level 
administrators choose to work for 
or leave the University of 
California because of their 
salaries. I think people come and 
stay at the University of 
California because they want to 
be a part of the number one pub-
lic university in the country. In 
order for us to remain the best, 
we must invest in the faculty, in 
staff and in student services.

to family planning costs. While the 
vast majority of private health 
insurance plans cover childbirth 
and even abortion, they often 
don't cover the cost of contracep· 
tion, which would prevent unin· 
tended births. State and federal 
legislation can correct this unac-
ceptable situation. 

Fifteen million women and 
teenagers are eligible for Title X 
reproductive and family planning 
health care. Yet 57 percent cannot 
get that care. 

Title X has been one of our 
most successful weapons in pre-
venting unintended pregnancy, 
teen births and abortions. But it 
has been constantly under attack 
by the U.S. Congress. 

Between 1980 and 1992, 
Congress slashed funding for 
Title X by a shocking 72 percent, 
despite the fact that every dollar

SALARY: 
Housing should 
come before raises 
Continued froIII ..... 7 

When I addressed the regents, 
I warned them that by increasing 
the top-level salaries we would be 
send ing the public a message that 
top-level administrative salaries 
are our top priority. 

My main concerns are that we 
improve the quality of our under-
graduate education and student 
services and that we reaffirm our 
commitment to diversity. I am 
concelned that the University of 
California does not reflect the 
diversity that exists in California . 

I am also concerned with the 
housing situation that currently 
plagues many of the UC campus· 
es. At our most recent meeting I 
engaged the regents in a discus· 
sion about housing, and as a 
result, I believe that more atten·

EVANSTON, Ill. - All across 
the nation, college campuses have 
adopted a new technological 
approach to learning: online 
courses. This craze sweeping the 
nation allows students to take 
credited courses on the Internet. 
Online leaming alJows students 
who have jobs and activities to 
lighten their classroom schedule 
and take classes at their own rate. 
Carrie Heeter, director of creative 
develorment for Michigan State 
Virtua University, said that 
Michigan State University has set 
up a virtual network that gives 
online courses the feeling of "a 
small-format discussion seminar 
as professors and students join in 
on chat rooms that allow everyone 
to participate." After positive stu-
dent feedback, MSU administra-
tion gave Heeter the approval to 
expand the program to 100 online 
courses. •

UCAB: Exact 
plans for expansion 
are not yet made 

University Centers Pam Pekarek. 
Students will be able to vote 

23 hours per day, Oct. 25-28. Any 
computer with Internet access is 
a voting site. There will also be 
computers available on Library 
Walk between 9 a.m. and 4:30 
p.m. on the days of the election. 

Brian Cross, the student 
UCAB chair, has spoken with 
several other universities who 
have tumed to electronic voting. 

"Penn and some other schools 
have seen an increase from 17 to 
18 percent voter tumout to 40 to 
50 percent," Cross said. "We're 
just hoping to get the percentage 
needed for this issue." 

The percentage heeded to pass 
the referendum is a complicated 
number that includes a minimum 
number of both the undergradu-
ate and graduate student popula- . 
tions. In order to pass, the fee 
increase would need a simple 
majority of this minimum num-
ber, which UCAB estimates to be 
3,900 votes. 

Plans for the 50,000 square 
feet of expansions include 24-
hour study lounges, conference 
rooms, a black box theater and 
additional indoor and outdoor 
seating. 

Exact plans will not be made 
until the referendum passes. 

"We haven't hired an architect 
- no money has been put 
toward planning," Pekarek said. 
"We want to have the confidence 
that this is what students want." 

The expansion carries a price 
tag with It. The lltudent centers 
fee, currently $37.50 per quarter, 
would increase by $25 per quar-

Jacqueline Stephens, a researcher 
and professor in the Department 
of Biological Sciences, said her 
current research may prove that a 
set of proteins in a person's fat 
cells causes Type 2 diabetes, the 
diabetes linked to obesity. 
Stephens' recent research found 
that Type 2 diabetics' fat cells 
contain defective proteins, which 
cause a person to be resistant to 
insulin, which moves sugar out 
of blood and into fat and skeletal 
muscle tissues.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. - A mosqui-
to-bome virus plaguing New York 
City neighborhoods is the cause of 
four deaths and up to 165 infec-
tions, state officials said last 
Wednesday. A fifth death was also 
reported late last Wednesday 
night in Westchester County. The 
New York State Department of 
Health said the infections may be 
caused by the West Nile virus, 
which has never before been 
reported in the Western 
Hemisphere. The West Nile virus 
is transmitted by a m!>Squito that 
receives the virus after feeding on 
an infected bird. The virus cannot 
be transmitted person-to-person 
or from bird to person, the depart-
ment of health said. The Federal 
Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC) stated that only 3 to 15 per-
cent of human cases are fatal. The 
CDC also stated that young chil-
dren and the elderly are more 
prone to casualty. Eric Giebelhaus, 
a Department of Health 
spokesperson, said it is not yet 
known how the virus arrived in 
New York. He also could not com-
flIIcnt on the spreading of the virus 
corne winter when infected birds 
migrate south. Air and land insec-
ticide sprayings began Sept. 3 in 
selected New York City boroughs 
to combat the infected mosqui-
toes. The sprayings continued for 
about three weeks.

Every five years the proposed 

fee would increase $5 to adjust 
for inflation. It could also 
decrease, however, as a result of 
planned fundraising efforts. 

The fee will not be imposed 
upon students until the comple-
tion of construction. 

"We won't start collecting the 
fee until the facilities are usable," 
University Centers Director Jim 
Carruthers said last spring. 

University Centers estimates 
construction would be complete 
by the 2002/2003 academic year. 

Additions to the Student 
Center would be built on top of 
Groundwork Books and KSDT, 
which are housed in the two sin-
gle-level sections of the center 
originally designed to support a 
second story. 

The Price Center would 
expand to the east, dislocating 
the campus police station. 

The police department has 
been looking to move to a newer 
facility, which would not be 
funded by the fee increase. 

Studentlink will serve as a 
doorway to the outside secure 
servers used to take the vote. 
Concemed about hackers and 
disruption on UCSD's servers, 
UCAB solicited an outside com-
pany to host the vote. 

Accessing Studentlink, how-
ever, which requires a student 
identification number and per-
sonal access code, is easier and 
more familiar to students, Cross 
said. 

The Studentlink page will 
provide links to pro- and con-
expansion pages, as well as to 
the offiCial text of the referen-
dum. 

The A. S. Council will be 
watching the election closely, 
hoping to also utilize the online 
process for its spring elections.

Video Hotline Will 
Expand Nuclear Safety 

Groups Found Pocketing Cash 
MOSCOW - The United States 

and Russia, updating the " hot 
line" concept between leaders of 
the world's most heavily armed 
nuclear powers, opened a new 
state-of-the-art video-conferenc-
ing center Saturday that will 
enable Russian and American 
nuclear officials to see, as well as 
talk, to each other during a 
nuclear-related emergency. 

At a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
Saturday afternoon, Bill 
Richardson, the U.s. secretary of 
energy, and Yevgeny Adamov, 
Russia's minister of atomic ener-
gy, said that the nuclear accident 
in Japan last week showed the 
need for such real-time lines of 
communication in the event of a 
nuclear crisis. 

Calling the accident in Japan 
" unsettling," Richardson said 
that the opening of a joint crisis 
center showed that if a nuclear 
incident takes place, leaders will 
be prepared to respond . 

Soon after the accident at the 

reprocessing plant near Tokyo, in 
which 35 people were exposed to 
high levels of radiation, 
Richardson and Adamov made an 
unprecedented offer of joint tech-
nical assistance to Japan. Adamov 
said Saturday that Japan had not 
accepted the offer so far and had 
informed his ministry that " the 
situation is under control." 

The center will allow real-time 
communication between the two 
energy agencies in times of 
nuclear or environmental emer-
gencies such as accidents at 
nuclear power or fuel facilities, 
the accidental release of radioac-
tive materials, or the theft or 
diversion of nuclear weapons or 
other nuclear materials. 

Richardson said Saturday that 
he was " very encouraged" by 
what he called the "growing 
partnership" in nuclear affairs 
between Moscow and 
Washington.

WASHINGTON - Officers of 
many nonprofit organizations 
have illegally enriched them-
selves by PQCketing millions of 
dollars of federal money that 
was meant to feed poor children 
in day care homes, federal inves-
tigators and state officials say. 

Agriculture Department 
Inspector General Roger Viadero 
said the nonprofit organizations 

- had routinely filed false claims 
overstating the number of meals 
served at the homes, which are 
recruited and supervised by the 
nonprofit groups. Some of these 
groups, he said, claimed federal 
money for mea Is served to 
"nonexistent children" in ficti-
tious day care homes, while oth-
ers extorted money by demand-
ing kickbacks from legitimate 
day care providers. 

" This type of fraud takes 
food out of the mouths of chil-
dren," Viadero said, summariz-
ing what his agents had found in 
more than 3,200 unannounced 
visits to private day care homes 
and child care centers that 
receive federal money. 

The 'federal government 
spends $1.7 billion a year to pro-
vide meals for 2.4 million chil-
dren in day care. Viadero began 
a nationwide investigation of the 
program after a whistle-blower 
complained about problems at a 
nonprofit organization in 
California. 

In September, Viadero's office 
issued a comprehensive audit 
laying out the abuses, which he 
said were attributable in part to 
basic flaws in the program's 
structure that federal officials 
had not moved fast enough to 
correct. 

The nonprofit groups, known 
as sponsors, act as middlemen 
between the government and 
day care homes and centers. 
They are supposed to monitor 
the day care homes. They review 
and pay claims for meals served, 
and are supposed to insure that 
the meals meet federal nutrition 
standards. 

So far the federal government 
has filed criminal charges 
against 44 people, asserting that 
they defrauded the program, 

known formally as the Child and 
Adult Care Food Program. 
Twenty-eight of them have been 
convicted or pleaded guirty; the 
other cases are still open. 

The audit report said: "Day 
care providers and their spon-
sors were found to be submitting 
false claims on a grand scale. 
Some were engaging in money 
laundering, embezzlement, 
forgery and extortion. Many 
simply padded their payrolls to 
justify fatter government 
checks." 

Katherine O'Neill, a dietitian 
at B.J. Enterprises in Scottsdale, 
Ariz., a sponsor for 380 day care 
homes, said the investigators 
had focused too much on paper-
work and bookkeeping errors. 

" Children can be happy even 
if day care providers don't do all 
their paperwork on time," said 
Ms. O'Neill, whose company 
was criticized for such errors. 
"Kids are eating better because 
of this program."

What do 40,000 pounds of 
birdseed have in common with 
America's war on drugs? 

Nothing, says Jean Laprise, 
an Ontario farmer who shipped 
the birdseed to his American 
customers only to have it seized 
when it crossed the U.S.-
Canadian border. 

Everything, say the U.S. gov-
ernment and its critics, but for 
altogether different reasons. 

The birdseed, nearly 20 tons of 
it, has been locked in a Detroit 
warehouse since Aug. 9, when it 
was impounded by the U.S. 
Customs Service. The reason: the 
seed consists of sterilized seeds 
processed from industrial hemp.

Security Concerns Delay Opening of Route 
Linking Palestinian Territories 

JERUSALEM - Israel and 
the Palestinian Authority, 
marching forward to ca rry out 
their latest peace deal, hit a snag 
this weekend on an issue fraught 
wi th emotions, politics and his-
tory for both sides. 

They delayed opening a safe-
passage route connecting the 
Gaza Strip ilnd the West Bank on 
Sunday after a fundamental dis-
ilgreement about security proce-
dures. 

While officiills called the dis-
agreement technical and said it 
would be resolved within days, 
it brought to the surface some of 
the distrust that gets suppressed 
in the name of peacemaking. 

The Israelis and the 
Palestinians essentially clashed 
over who would control the flow 
of human traffic on a 28-mile 
route that is to link the two 
Pillestinian territories. They also 
disagreed about whether the 
route, along existing Israeli roads, 
would be considered " extraterri-
torial ," as the Pilles tinians 
demand, or would remain under 
Israeli sovereignty. 

Specifically, the Pillestinians 
ins is t that they, rilther than the 

" I feel really let down," 
said Khaled Khader, 36, a 
bank officer in Gaza City. 
" How can the safe pas-
sage be safe if Israelis 
have the right to arrest 
our people when they 
cross the border? How 
can it be free if the Israelis 
have the right to define 
who can use it or not." 

Israelis, issue the magnetic cards 
that will serve as border crossing 
permits. And they demand that 
Israel let all travelers be safe 
from interception - and arrest 
- by the Israeli police for prior 
offenses or for questioning. 

" Should Israel be able to 
seize people using the safe pas-
sage, it will tum into a trap for 
the Palestinians," said Jamil 
Tarifi, the Palestinians' minister 
for civilian affilirs. 

The route, con necting Erez in 
Gazil and Tarqumiya near 
Hebron in the West Bank, was 

scheduled to open Friday under 
the peace agreement signed on 
Sept. 5. Because of the Jewish 
and Muslim days of rest, it was 
postponed until Sunday by 
mutual decision but then got 
mired in a discussion of details 
that went deeper. 

As negotiations wended into 
the night, officials said th~y 
expected to reach a compromise 
and open the safe passage by the 
end of this week at the latest. 
After four hours of talks, nego-
tiators for both sides said they 
would reconvene on Monday. 

In the Gaza Strip, many 
Palestinians voiced disappoint-
ment that their isolation had not 
ended on schedule - and deep 
suspicion of the Israelis and their 
own leaders. 

" I feel really let down," said 
Khaled Khader, 36, a bank offi-
cer in Gaza City. " How can the 
safe passage be safe if Israelis 
have the right to arrest our peo-
ple when they cross the border? 
How can it be free if the Israelis 
have the right to define who can 
use it or not ."

Barbara Brody, a primary 
organizer of the event and profes-
sor at the UCSD School of

a big step in helping people with 
macular degeneration. 

"1 think it was an uplifting 
event for the 2,024 people there," 
Brody said. 

Earl Gilman, who has had 
macular degeneration for five 
years, described his experi-
ences. 

"First of all, everything you 
see is a haze," Gilman said. "1 had 
to give up driving, reading, and I 
can't recognize my neighbors. It 
just gets more and more frustrat-

With 12 to 15 million people in 
the United States afflicted and 50 
to 70 thousand affected in San 
Diego County alone, politicians 
attended the event to show their 
recognition of macular degenera-
tion.

AIDS: 
Organizers hope to 
raise $1 million 
Cowau •• d .......... 1 
National AIDS Advocacy Project, 
San Diego Clean Needle 
Exchange, Lesbian and Gay 
Men's Community Center and 
Vista Community Clinic. 

The efforts of UCSD's partici-
pating organizations con-
tributed to the fund-raising 
event, which hoped to raise $1 
million to benefit educational 
outreach programs and ensure 
the availability of services to San 
Diego residents infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/ AIDS. 

AIDS is caused by HIV, a virus 
which attacks the immune sys-
tem and leaves the body vulnera-
ble to infections and diseases. 
HIV can be spread through the 
use of contaminated needles or in 
rare cases of blood transfusion, 
but the life-threatening illness is 
primarily transmitted during sex-

ual contact. 
The Centers for Disease 

Control & Prevention and 
National Center for HIV, STD 
and TB Prevention conducted a 
study in December of 1998 to 
determine the 10 states reporting 
the highest number of AIDS cases 
among residents. With 110,056 
reported AIDS cases, California 
wat; found to be the state with the 
second highest number of resi-
dents with AIDS. 

One of the greatest dangers 
with AIDS is that an infected 
person may not even know that 
he or she is carrying and spread-
ing the disease. The onset of 
AIDS does not begin immediate-
ly after a person becomes infect-
ed with the HIV virus. It may 
take up to six months to test 
positive for the virus, and as 
many as 10 to 12 years to be 
diagnosed with the full onset of 
AIDS. In most cases, people 
infected with the virus die 
because they are unable to fight 
off opportunistic diseases (ill-
nesses which a healthy body can 
normally fight off).

BUSINESS: 
Dunn anticipates a 
strong enrollment 
eo.tIIIued .......... 1 

Associate Dean for 
Continuing Education Bruce 
Dunn stated that UCSD 
Extension "received dozens of 
phone calls and visits from stu-
dents as soon as the program was 
announced, and enrollment in 
the 'introduction to business' 
course filled at 50 students with-
in only three weeks." 

Based on spring quarter 
demand, Dunn anticipates that 
enrollment will be strong this fall, 
as well. 

Vice Chancellor Joseph 
Watson, one of many staff mem-
bers involved in the creation of 
the program, said he is excited 
about the new opportunities that 
it will provide for students. 

"We're very pleased and 
proud of this venture because it is 

a partnership between local 
employers and the campus to 
ensure that UCSD graduates are 
the best potential employees they 
can be." 

Students interested in the cer-
tificate program or any of its 
associated courses should contact 
the Department of Business, 
Management and Professional 
Practice at UCSD Extension. 
Students can call 534-3434 or e-
mail ,,"exbllsi@lIcsd.edll for a list 
of eligible classes. 

Interested students can also 
visit the UCSD Extension website 
at IIltp://www-esps."csd.ed" . 
Students can then register for 
courses as they normally would 

through the Telephone 
Student Service Registration 
System or UCSD Extension. 

Students must apply for the 
certificate before completion of 
all required courses. The certifi-
cate courses are included in nor-
mal tuition fees but, as with other 
classes, books and equipment are 
additional.

Josephine ROberts/ Guardian 

The recent growth of online book sellers has affected the price and competition 
between textbook vendors, but which is better: online or on campus? 

1 he price of textbooks has long been a burden on s tu-dents, who o ften need to penn y-pinch their way th ro ugh coll ege. Previously, options have been lim ited due 
to the ca mpus bnokstore's 

. monopoly o n the sa le of reguired text-
books. Very rarely ca n s tudents go to 
the loca l libra ry or to the nea res t book-
s tore and pick up wha t they need . 

Since las t year however, the number 
of Internet w eb si tes ava ilable where 
s tudents ca n buy their textbooks has 
increased exponent ially. Before, s tu-
dents looking fo r d iscounts would 
have to go hunting around San Diego. 
Now, they ca n s it d own, thumb 
through a number of online sellers, 
'compare prices and decide the best 
deal for the mselves. With a minimal 
il mount of resea rch, s tudents Cil n get 
the di~counts they need . 

Last yea r there were a few reputable 
onl ine bookstores ye t, the latest explo-
sion of textbook si tes on the Internet 
has caused a n increase in competition 
between online and on-campus ven-
dors, consequently benefiting students' 
pocketbooks. 

Before, the only op tion stud ents 
had was to ei ther buy from the UCSD 
Bookstore, o r to go to one of the other 
book ~e l lers loca ted on ca mpus. 
Among them are the UCSD Books tore, 
Groundworks books, Revelle Bargain 
books and the General Store Co-op. 

For some, there are a number of rea-
son~ to choose the bookstore. Online 
textbook sellers usuilily require a cred-
it cilrd number, which is impo sible fo r 
some studen ts. Another reason IS habit 
and convenience. 

Accordi ng to Ma rshil ll senior Betti-
nil Kaes, there are several reasons why 

she hasn' t bought her books online. 
"Buying your books on campus is 

just a reflex," said Kaes. "I don 't have a 
credit card, so that makes ordering 
stuff online impossible. The real rea-
son, however, is that you can't thumb 
through the books when you buy 
online. If you decide the book isn' t 
worth owning, and you order online, 
it's a pain to re turn." 

Others like the idea of supporting 
the school or supporting businesses 
that employ students. However, new 

This yea r, the UCSD Bookstore 
launched the "Save-il-Million" cam-
paign. It is designed to save students 
$1 million over the next year. However, 
some students believe that because of 
the bookstore's long-standing monop-
oly, this campaign isn ' t enough. 

"It's ridiculous," Shibata said . 'Tve 
been here for three years and when I 
had to buy my books from there, I 
never felt like I was saving money or 
that the bookstore was attempting to 
help me. If you ask any other continu-

PreviouslYI options have been limited due to the monoRo Y the main bookstore has had on 
the sale of needed textbooks. Very rarely can 
students go to the local library or to the near-
est bookslore and pick up what they n~ed. 
advertising practices of online book-
stores include employing s tudents to 
do their advertising. 

Marshall senior Scott Shibata, who 
is a lso the head representative for var-
sitybooks.com, sa id the UCSD Book-
store located in Price Center is the 
worst possible place to shop. He claims 
that despite the new ca mpaigns 
launched by the bookstore this yea r to 
save s tudents $1 million, s tud ents 
deserve a bette r, more competit ive ser-
vice that doesn' t exploit the students' 
need fo r tex tbooks. 

ing student, they'll most likely tell you 
the same thing." . 

He also pointed out that saving stu-
dents $1 million, in comparison to the 
money students spend at the book-
store, doesn' t necessarily amount to 
much

ing toward students regarding the gen-
eral prices of various book vendors. 

In a survey conducted on Sept. 14 of 
102 classes with enrollment exceeding 
1SO students, price comparisons were 
examined between the bookstore and 
four different online book sellers . 

The online textbook sellers com-
pared were varsitybooks.com, big-
words.com, ecampus.com and efol-
lett.com. 

Bigwords.com's prices averaged 12 
percent less than the bookstore. Used 
books are available, however big-
words.com doesn't guarantee avail-
ability of used books. Students order-
ing textbooks can opt to order only 
used if available, and if used books are 
not available; they may cancel the 
order. Or, students can choose to buy 
new if used is not available. On aver-
age, bigwords.com didn't have 22 per-
cent of the books available for immedi-
ate ihipping. 

The price of ecampus.com books 
averaged 13 percent less than the book-
store. Ecampus didn't have 25 percent 
of required textbooks available ' for 
shipping. Thirteen percent of the books 
available for purchase could be bought 
used. 

Efollett.com was a rare case, 
because in this instance its prices actu-
ally averaged 1 percent higher than the 
bookstore. However, it had 38 percent 
of its textbooks available used, and 
only 19 percent of text books were 
unavailable.

Clubs respond to the growing underage market in San Diego 
Clubs now o.ffer a variety of options for under-21-year-old patrons looking for hip-hop, salsa or swing 
By MELODY GONZALES 
Senior Staff Writer 

Unless you are 21 years or 
older, it may seem like a difficult 
task to find any nightlife in San 
Diego. Although the Gaslamp 
District and downtown area are 
home to several clubs, none 
allow for patrons younger than 
21. 

Establishments like these tar-
get customers who, through 
their purchase and consumption 
of alcoholic beverages, will yield 
the greatest financial gain. In 
other words, it is not in the clubs' 
econonUc interest to attract a 
younger crowd. But fear not my 
felIow underage party freaks, 
San Diego is slowly beginning to 
recognize and address the 
demand and potential economic 
power of the underage, college 
student population. 

One of the most recent under-
age clubs to sprout up in San 
Diego is Club Elements. Located 
at 1255 University Ave. in Hill-
crest, this club will keep you 
moving to techno, hip hop, 
house and jungle music from 8 
p.m. to 2 a.m. The cover is usu-
ally $5, but may be a bit higher if 
there is a special guest D.j. To 
find out about the club's special 
events, call (858) 296-8160. You 
must be 18 or older to attend. 

Hip hop, R&B, house, K-Rock 
and bootie bass music are the 
claims to fame for Ice House, 
located at 775 Metcalf in Escon-
dido. Thursday is "Ladies' 
Night," whereupon women get 
into the club for free. Before 9:30 
p.m . on Fridays, the cover is only 
51 , but the lines get long so it's 
best to arrive around 8 p .m . San 
Diego's jammin' Z90 radio sta-
tion gives out prizes and plays • 
the jams on Saturday nights. This 
may sound fine and dandy, espe-
cially because everyone age 16 or 
older can get their groove on. But 

be prepared to see girls that look 
12 years old, and probably took 
their older sisters' 1.0.5 in order 
to wear their big shoes and little 
skirts out on the dance floor. If 
you're comfortable with all this, 
calI (760) 741-1271 for .more 
information. 

If you are over 18 years old 
and into the Gothic scene, The 
Empire Club at 4225 30th St. in 
San Diego is the place for you. 
Enter the darkness and surround 
yourself with Goth people and 
music. Drinks (non-alcoholic, of 
course) are only 50 cents, or 
guests can splurge 
and pay 52 for a 
specialty beverage 
- Red Bull The 
cover is $5 when 

there is a D.j., or $7 when a bilnd 
plays. Call (6l9) 640-8689 to hear 
about the club's upcoming 
events. 

Another recent addition to 
San Diego'S underage night 
scene is Jive junction, located at 
8450 Mira Mesa Blvd. in the Mira

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Glamour scholarship rockets exceptional students into luxury 

LEENA SHANKAR 
ManaMinM Editor 

in Thousand Oaks, I received a 
phone call informing me that I'd 
won the award. I couldn't believe 
that I was chosen, especially in 
light of the fact that there are so 
many amazing college women in 
this country. 

The first step in receiving the 
award was to head to a photo 
shoot in Los Angeles, not far from 
my home in Thousand Oaks. I 
arrived at the contemporary 
hotel, The Standard, and was 
amazed at how all the guests and 
workers looked the same -
everyone was very trendy, good-

• pher Damon had me hold impos-
sible poses for endless minutes 
while people kept fussing with 
my hair and makeup. The whole 
experience took a little over six 
hours, and as fun and exciting as 
it was, I also developed a new-
found respect for models and the 
patience they must have. Appar-
ently, being beautiful can be 
exhausting work. 

A few weeks later, while living 
in San Francisco, I received' a fran-
tic phone call from Glamollr's 
photo editor. She said that the 
photos were all wrong and would 

included the perfume called Red, 
red fruit, red everything. The 
rooms were intended to be a full 
sensory experience. 

The next day, Rita and I were 
whisked away to our photo 
shoot, which was held on Broad-
way. The building, called "Sky," 
appeared to be plain and rather 
normal from the outside, but once 
inside I traveled to the top pent-
house, whereupon the elevator 
doors opened to reveal a beauti-
ful garden, complete with trees, 
flowers and lawns, all on top of a 
building in Manhattan. 

My experience began when I 
was 16 years old. Having gradu-
ated from SL'Vellteell to Glamour, I 
took special interest in the annual 
October college section, in which 
Glamollr editors select the top ten 
college women in the country 
from hundreds of applications. 
Selection is based on academics, 
leadership, community service 
and future goals. 

These women have served as 
an inspiration to me, and I always 
have dreamed of being among 
their ranks. Even so, never did I 
imagine that my dream would 
come true. 

The photo shoot itself was unlike any experience I have 
ever had. When I stepped into the hotel room where 
the shoot was to take place, I was greeted by five peo-
ple smoking cigarettes and talking on cell phones. 

The application for this award 
is due in January of junior year, 
and I applied with the slimmest 
hopes of being considered for the 
award . I mailed my application 
un the last day possible - but I 
put the package together very 
carefully. For five months, I heard 
no news regarding my status and 
I had, in a sense, given up on the 
award. However, I kept sending 
the editors in charge of the com-
petition updates on my life and 
achievements. 

My mom started making fun 
of me, joking that even after the 
contest was long over, I would 
still be sending the editors extra-
neous information about my life. 
But, I believe that it was this per-
sistentence that gave rise to the 
most exciting phone call of my 
life.

As I walked around the comer, 
I entered the penthoUle, which 
was indescribably amazing as 
well. Every wall was a window 
allowing a 360-degree view of the 
city. (I later found out that 
Tommy Hilfiger held a fashion 
show there the week before and 
that "Sex in the City" had recent-
ly been filmed there). A two-level 
residence, the color schemes and 
furniture were bizarre, as was the 
skylight bridge and the deep, 
dark blue rooftop pool that was a 
perfect 80 degrees. 

This time around, the photo 
shoot was more conservative and 
really fun. The photographers, 
artists and fashion editors made 
us feel like models for a day. The 
catered food was fantastic -
probably the best carrot cake that 
I have ever tasted ... although I 
have to wonder if real models eat 
like that! I met a few of the other 
winners and also found out that 
the photo crew was traveling out 

•• 

to South Africa to shoot another 
winner who was there for the 
summer. 

After the photo-shoot saga 
was over, while waiting for the 
October issue of Glamour to hit 
the newsstands, I attended anoth-
er trip to New York City that 
Glamour arranged for all ten 
women. We stayed at The W, 
another boutique hotel, which 
was also '1uite simplistic like The 
Tune but Instead had an organic 
theme - the benches in the lobby 
had grass growing out of them. 
Breakfast consisted of wheat 
grass juice, a peach-papaya 
smoothie, goat-milk yogurt and 
granola. 

I believe it deserves to be men-
tioned that aU of the bellboys at 
this hotel were hot. Decked in 
khakis and trendy black T ..nirts, 
I'm sure a few of them mUit have 
been models or actors trying to 
break into the businell. In any 
case, they definitely contributed 
to the overan atmosphere of this 
interesting hotel. I roomed with a 
winner named Lana from the 

. University of Iowa. She is a Tru-
man Scholar and president of her 
student body, which numbers 
above 40,000. Each of the other 
winners was equally as amazing. 
Not only was everyone extremely 
accomplished, but they were also 
unbelievably nice and down-to-
earth 

This entire trip was very spe-
cial and inspirational to me not 
only due to the people involved 
but also because it focused on 
woman-empowerment in today's 
society. One of the highlights of 
our trip, for example, was attend-
ing a banquet in our honor spon-
sored by both Glamollr and Nike. 
Here, I had the opportunity to 
meet Bonnie Fuller, editor-in-
chief of Glamollr as well as 
acclaimed author Naomi Wolf.

for sale. 

In addition to saving money 
on purchases made online, stu-
dents benefit because many of 
the online bookstores do not 
charge sales tax on the textbooks 
they sell. Except in certain cir-
cumstances, where the store 
must charge sales tax, interstate 
shipping eliminates sales tax. 

Average percentages do not 
guarantee lower prices, howev-
er. For the best price, its good to 
check out the UCSD Bookstore's 
prices then check out the online 
prices . Bookstore policy does 
make it a little difficult to do 
this. Student employees of the 
bookstore are instructed not to 
give the ISBN numbers of books 
and the prices of books to stu-
dents asking for them over the 
phone, according to a former 
bookstore employee. An ISBN 
number and the price makes it 
easier for students to look their 
books up on-line. 

"The bookstore has a local 
monopoly over textbooks," Shi-
bata said. "The bookstore uses 
[its) power as a monopoly to 
charge prices on textbooks well 
above the competitive level. Var-
sitybooks.com allows students to 
avoid these obscure prices and 
save money. Why spend any 
more than you have to on some-
thing that you you're only going 
to use for 10 weeks?" 

POLICIES 
Marshall senior Chris Reefe is 

on the fence about where to get 
his books. 

"I know that I should order 
on-line because the books are a lot 
cheaper," said Reefe. 'Tm just 

used to getting them at the book 
store and getting that sense of 
accomplishment. It's a hassle to 
change that." 

However, shipping prices tend 
to deter students as well. The 
policies of the various booksellers 
is worth investigating when 
choosing a book online. 

Bigwords.com's general ship-
ping policy varies from book to 
book. For many books, big-
words.com states that it can ship 
within five to seven business 
days . Bigwords.com's genera I 
policy is to ship for free in three 
to five days, for orders over $35. 
For orders under $35 shipping 

3-5 business days: 
$3.95 + $.95 ea. add.

costs are $4.90 plus $1.95 for

books in two to three days, the 
cost is $5.90 plus $1.90 for each

ery costs $11 .90 plus $1.90 for

The return policy of big-
words.com states that books can 
be returned within 15 days of 
order, which potentially allows 
for returns within 10 days of 
receiving an order. Bigwords.com

Some people have had horrif-
ic experiences with online text-
book sellers in the past. Accord-
ing to Marshall senior Marc 
Comer, using bigwords.com 
was the worst possible experi-
ence. 

"Last year, I ordered nine 
books from bigwords.com," 
said Comer. "Expecting the 
'ships in two to three days' to be 
a bit optimistic, I purchased the 
books a week before classes 
began. Two weeks later I was

Spa retreat proved 
to be heaven-like 
C ...... Ilrr.. ..... U 
Wolf gave an inspirational speech 
on how women should treat 
themselves and expect to be treat-
ed as Hwarrior princesses" in 
today's world - tough and 
strong. yet special and beautiful. 
She encouraged women to have a 
strong speaking voice and not to 
flinch from praise. 

After the luncheon, we were 
treated to a spa retreat in SoHo. 
This turned out to be one of the 
highlights of the New York City 
trip. Owned by two women, the 
spa was the epitome of tranquilli-
ty and comfort and was often fre-
quented by Carolyn Bessette-
Kennedy before her tragic death. 

As part of our spa retreat, we 
were each allowed to select from 
a variety of treatments. ) opted for

sage as well as the botanical body 
buff. ) received the facial experi-
ence first, and it was heavenly. I 
crawled under covers and relaxed 
while an expert masseuse treated 
my face with various lotions, 
scrubs, masks, steam and oils. 
The massage was so wonderful 
that) nearly fell asleep. 

After this, we were given a lit-
tle down-time, so I relaxed with 
some of the other girls while 
Swedish women brought us 
herbal teas, dried fruits, brie and

Next, I had to .put all modesty

These courses are in addition to

what more coherent and broader

In the spring Critical Gender 
Studies newsletter, Hartouni stat-
ed that the Committee on Educa-
tional Policy "expressed concern 
that [the change from Women's 
Studies to Critical Gender Stud-
ies) might work to alienate 
and/or exclude some faculty and 
students." They approved the 
change, but have SUggbted that 
the program "be reviewed in two 
years." 

The student guide to the Criti-
cal Gender Studies Program 
defines Critical Gender Studies as 
"to study gender critically is to 
refute easy answers and simple 
conclusions with respect to men 
and women in socie1y and reach, 
instead, for clearer, more detailed 
accounts of the social, political, 
economic, historical and cultural 
contexts and intricacies of power 
through which the social refations 
of gend!!r have been made and 
maintained. " 

CouneWork 
UCSD's Women's Studies cllr-

riculum was "devised and for-
. malized" in 1991. The program 

takes an interdiSCiplinary 
approach to the consideration 
and examination of gender as it 
intersects with race, class, sexual-
ity and culture across time and 
place. This approach allows a stu-
dent to re-examine the world 
around her or him through a gen-
dered lens. 

The Women's Studies major 
centered on the choice of one of 
three concentrations: history. lit-

requires a three-
part introd.uctory sequence of 
courses. Under the Women's 
Studies major, 2A served as an 
"Intro to Feminist Theory and 
Methods: Survey of Feminist 
Critiques." 2B covered "Contests 
and Controversies in Feminist 
Analysis" and examined a dif-
fere(lt topic each year. Topics 
have included occupational seg-
regation, feminization of pover-
ty, pornography and masculini-
ty. 

The upper division segment, 
Women's Studies 100, looked at 
"Feminism in a Global Frame: 
Politics, Positions and Practices." 
This coverage of non-western 
feminism allowed for a broader 
consideration of what constitutes 
feminism in different racial, 
social, economic and cultural 
locations. 

With the change to Critical 
Gender Studies, this core course 
work has shifted. The program's 
core curriculum builds upon fem-
inist scholarship of the last 
decade, incorporating the new 
interdisciplinary agendas, intel-
lectual debates, changing 
methodological practices and 
major scholarly shifts that have 
reshaped the field of Women's 
Studies. All majors and minors 
must take the introductory 
sequence: 2A, 2B, 100 and 101. 

With the new major, 2A has 
become Hlntro to Critical Gender 
Studies: Social Movements." 2B is 
now "Gender and Institutions" 
including family, education, the 
workplace and citizenship. One-
hundred focuses on "Conceptual-

Transportation and Parking Services 

launches its newest parking shuttle 
service, the Regents Express, on Sep-

tember 27, 1999. Designed to provide a 
convenient connection between the Price 

Center and UCSO's new Regents Road 
parking lot, the service operates 7:00 a.m.-

12:20 a.m., when school is in session. 
The Regents Road surface lots, which are 

served by the new shuttles, were built to offset 
the loss of parking spaces due to the major con-

struction of two parking structure facilities on 
the main campus. The parking structures are 

scheduled to open in the Fall of 2000. 
Until then, parking is projected to be limited in the 

university center areas. Affiliates are encouraged to 
rideshare to campus. Those choosing to drive should

ContI ................ u 
day and a half of living in the con-
stant noise of New York City, the 
magazine offices provided a sur-
prising sanctuary of silence. 

We later went to Broadway to 
see a play called ·"Sideman." 
which won a Tony Award for 
"best play" this year. Incredibly. 
we also met the cast afterward 
(including Andrew McCarthy of 
"St. Elmo's Fire" and "Man-
nequin" fame) . During intermis-
sion, we spotted Emmy-wiMing 
actor John Lithgow, who was 
very friendly. 

We were tired after the play, 
but being that it was the last night 
that we would be together in 
New York City. we decided to 
explore the night life. The W 
Hotel is also home to the 
club/bar Whiskey Blue, which is 
owned by Cindy Crawford and 
her husband. There was a two-
hour line outside. but with our 
room keys and gender. we were 
able to make it to the front of the 
line and enter instantaneously .• 

The club was hopping with

City.) It was rumored that Kathy 
Ireland was there that night. 

In any case, we enjoyed each 
others' company and were com-
fortable being confident women. I 
think it was this aura that led to 
innumerable free drinks being 
sent our way anq many men 
wanting to join our circle. 

I realized that contrary to what 
society may dictate. women do 
not have to be demure, sub-
servient or blatantly sexy in order 
to be attractive. Bold, ambitious. 
confident. "warrior· rrincess" 
with class and grace wil not only 
draw admirers but will be suc-
cessful too. I think it is extremely 
important that women, especially 
while growing up, learn this les-
son and apply it to their lives. 

Overall, this trip was an amaz-
ing. unforgettable experience and 
I am thankful that I have it as a 
resource to draw upon in the 
future. I think everyone, at some 
point, deserves to be pampered 
and treated as the truly valuable 
individuals that they are. Most 
importantly, IS the other winners 
and all the other people (includ-
ing actors, journalists, authors 
and restaurant owners) on this 
trip taught me, each person is 
diverse in interests and back-
ground; it is this diversity that 
contributes to the rich beauty and 
resilience of the tapestry of Amer-
ican life.

"I never drank before." 

"The first night I was 
partying with my new 
boyfriend. I was drinking 
and drinking and I bent 
over and threw up 
I!verywhere. It was 
embarrassing because I 
was trying to make a good 
impression, be a hard-core 
drinker."

I could drink it like beer. 
My parents found me

Women's Studies classes are 
available from Groundworks 
Books. The required reading 
leans heavily toward paperback 
editions and readers from Cal 
Copy. This helps significantly 
with the cost issue of textbook 
purchases. 

Varying from statistics on the 
percentage of women in political 
office in western countries to an 
ethnography of factory daughters 
in rural Java to Simone de Beau-
voir's philosophical texts to a 
novel about a native woman in 
colonial Nigeria, the reading for 
gender studies courses represents 
a span of sources of information 
and values them all. 

The reading load is challeng-
ing. It falls short of unreasonable, 
while creating a more nuanced 
understanding of the subject mat-
ter. But there are some days when 
a student just wants the light ver-
sion. 

Post-Graduation 
One of the top questions for 

any major is what one can do 
with it after graduation. Accord-
ing to the Critical Gender Studies 
department, a major in Women's 
Studies or Critical Gender Studies 
serves as a springboard for 
"career aspirations in law, medi-
cine and health sciences, public 
administration, and social ser-
vices."

CoMI ............... a 
UCSD scored again. Bernard 
added his second assist of the 
evening with a pass to Justin 
Roach. who booted the ball past 
the Panthers' goalie to seal the 
Triton victory at 5-1 . 

"It seems when the team kicks 
the ball around, we play more 
[competitively]," said Bernard. 
"The defense started it off by 
playing good in the back." 

Opening the contest, UCSD 
came out very aggressively, tak-
ing a first-half 1-0 lead .after Josh 
Davis scored an unassisted goal 
at the 29:40 mark. After that, the 
two teams kicked the ball back 
and forth until the Triton explo-
sion. 

"We weren't ourselves," said 
Armstrong, who thinks that 
maybe the start of school and the 
new responsibilities may have 
distracted his team. 

"It was a little bit of inexperi-
ence," commented Chapman 
coach Eddie Carrillo of his team's 
second-half collapse. Armstrong 
was happy with the large crowd

While most of us were loung-
ing around on the couch on a 
Friday evening with our hearts 
doing very little work as they 
pumped the near-stagnant flow 
of blood through our motionless 
body, the dyna'mic UCSD 
women's volleyball team was 
involved in a more stimulating 
and a slightly more kinetic 
engagement. 

Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland and his squad of 
female volleyball players trav-
eled north to the L.A. area to face 
the University of La Verne. The 
Tritons came, they saw and they 
conquered the opposition - in 
three straight sets by scores of 
15-6,15-11,15-2. 

The win did not come with-
out struggle. however. The 
women's volleyball team was 
coming off masterful play in the 
Puget Sound Invitational and 
against the University of 
Redlands. 

This time the team was slight-
ly more lethargic but pulled 
through when it needed to.

their playas a cohesive unit all 
the more enjoyable to witness. 

Next up for the Tritons is the 
UCSD Wyndham Invitational, 
which begins on Friday Oct. 8 
and continues on Saturday. 

Partaking in the tournament 
will be CSU-Hayward; Emory, 
Ga.; Trinity, Tx. and St. 
Benedict, Minn. All the teams 
are among the top 20 in the 
nation, and CSU-Hayward is a 
regional powerhouse each year 
so UCSD will surely have its 
hands full this weekend. 

A win at this tournament 
would put the Tritons in the dri· 
ver's seat in their quest for a 
birth in the post season and a 
possible second national cham-
pionship in the last three years. 

Other quarterbacks who've 
suffered similar smashes to the 
head include Joe Montana and 
Jim Miller. I remember when 
Montana was playing with the 
Kansas City Chiefs in a playoff 
game against the Buffalo Bills in 
Buffalo. 

He was hit as he was about to 
throw and his head struck the 
frozen turf of Rich Stadium. The 
glare in his eyes as he grabbed his 
helmet in shock was caught per-
fectly by NBC cameras which 
once again gave a national televi· 
sion-viewing audience a sense of 
the risk and potential for injury 
which pro-football poses to its 
quarterbacks. It's a dirty game, 
but someone has got to play it. 
I'm glad it's not you or me, and 
I'm sorry Steve Young has to be 
sacrificed for our enjoyment.

Water Polo Team Drowns Tournament Foes 
PERIERVERANCE: Despite missing nine key team members, the Tritons amass a 4-1 record at the Santa Cruz Slugfest 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

It's Sunday morning, and I'm-
tired, hung over, cranky and irri-
tated that I have to go to class 
tomorrow morning. 

I sit up in bed and wipe my 
eyes, cursing the fact that 1 have 
to go to class tomorrow. In short, 
I do not feel up to my full capa-
bil ities as I hop in the shower and 
prepare for a long day of Guardiall 
editing. 

The problem is that even 
though I am not 100 percent, that 
doesn't mean that I can just stay 
in bed . I have a job to do. 

The men's water polo team 
knows exactly what I'm talking 
about. The team traveled to UC 
Santa Cruz for the annual UC 
Santa Cruz Slugfest with nine of 
its key players missing from the 
venture. 

Suspended for violating team 
policy, these nine stayed home

while the remainder of the team 
traveled north to defend the 
honor of UCSD water polo. 
After all was said and done, the 
remaining members put forth an 
admirable showing, winning 
four games in the tournament 
and losing only one. 

In the first game of the tourna-
ment, Jon Roy scored four goals 
while Ross Mechum scored three, 
leading the Tritons to a 11-6 victo-
ry over conference rival UC 
Davis. 

"The difference was our solid 
defense," said Head Coach 
Denny Harper. "I was real 
pleased with our performance 
and our effort." 

The Tritons then played the 
Air Force Academy, a team that 
they had already beaten soundly 
earlier in the season. 
Unfortunately for the Tritons, his-
tory did not repeat itself and 
UCSD fell 9-5. 

"We missed several key six-

on-fives," said Harper, Nand a 
two-pointer at the end sealed the 
victory tor them." 

Disappointed and looking for 
redemption, the Tritons took on 

the host Banana Slugs of UC 
Santa Cruz. After one period the 
Tritons were down 1-0 but then 
outscored the Banana Slugs 9-1 
over the next two periods, sealing 
the victory. 

At the end, the Tritons had 
escaped after their slow start with 
a 12-6 victory and were again led 
by Roy with 3 goals, including 
one1 two-point goal late in the 
match. 

The University of Pomona 
Sagehens were the Tritons' next 

opponent, and as it turns out, 
their next victim. Kellan Hori led 
the Tritons with three goals. 
Mechum added two more includ-
ing one two-point goal. The result 
was never in doubt as the Tritons 
romped to a 13-6 victory in domi-
nant fashion. 

In the final game of the tow-
nament, the Tritons took on the 
University of Santa Clara. 

Earlier this season, Santa 
Clara faced a Triton offense fir-
ing on all cylinders and was 
crushed 20-3 in the UC San 
Diego Triton Invitational. 

This time around, Santa Clara 
put forth a better effort, especially 
on defense, but still fell to the 
Tritons 12-6. 

Despite the loss to the Air 
Force Academy, the Tritons have 
to consider themselves lucky for 
going 5-1 while the suspensions 
were in place. 

"Our effort was surerior 
[during the last six games and I 

was really,Pleased with our per-
formance: Harper said of his 
team's ability to respond to 
recent adversity. The Tritons 
will be back at full strength with 
all members on Wednesday 
when they take on the 
University of La Verne. 

The reinstatement of the Triton 
players could not have come at a 
better time because the Triton 
schedule gets more difficult from 
here on out. After the match 
against La Verne they will be 
served a steady helping of tearns 
from the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, the conference that 
contains all the top eight tearns in 
the nation. 

"1 wouldn't want to be La 
Verne on Wednesday," Harper 
said. "Those guys who have 
been sitting out are fired up to 
play some water polo." Get out 
to Canyon View pool on 
Wednesday to root the Tritons 
on to victory.

OAKLAND: 
Unexpected results 
in MLB this season 
C" ..... baed "- ..... 43 
interference. 

Ok, so I was wrong!! 
This season has been miser-

able for me and all other Dodger 
fans. I have been forced to look 
for something about the game 
that makes me excited. The home 
run chase has lost its luster the 
second time around and even the 
rivalry with the hated Giants has 
been somewhat uneventful. 

The one thing that has kept me 
interested is the play of the 
Oakland Athletics. 

Baseball has become sicken-
ingly predictable the last couple 
of seasons. The teams who have 

spent the big money have been 
the teams that have made the 
lengthy playoff runs. The 
Yankees, the team with the largest 
payroll in the league, have won 
the World Series two out of the 
last three years, and the Atlanta 
Braves, another big-money team, 
have been the decade's most win-
ning program. 

The other team to win the 
Series in the last three years, the 
Florida Marlins, spent all of 
Wayne Huizinga's money on 
their march to the series two 
years ago and are now perennial 
bottom dwellers in the National 
League East. 

This fact alone shows how 
urgent the money problem has 
become in the Major Leagues. 
When these kind of antics are 
what small market teams resort to 
to be competitive every couple of 

The UCSD Guardian 

years, they must be pretty desper-
ate. Oakland managed to be com-
petitve without such ploys. 

The Athletics have been the 
exception to the rule. With one of 
the leagues lowest payrolls, the 
Athletics managed to stay in the 
playoff race until the bitter end. 
Oakland also has the disadvan-
tage of playing in one of the 
league's smaller markets, there-
fore not drawing the kinds of 
crowds that Cleveland and New 
York draw on a daily basis. 

Relying on such "stars" as 
Jason Giambi and Matt Stairs, 
the Athletics were not supposed 
to compete at all this year. In my 
rotisserie baseball league (please 
refrain from snide giggling or 
any dork comments) I voted to 
leave them out completely 
because they had no talent to 
add to the game. 

Small, two-person home office in Del Mar seeks freshman/sophomore 
UCSD student to ~ probior and office manager, providing adrnirmtratiVe 
and computer support, as weD as perfOnning basic maintenance-related 
tasks as necessary. Looking fOr reliable, responsible, conscientious person 
with ability to act under general direction. Administrative duties include, 
but are not limited to, speadsheet creation, data entry, general clerical 
support, and assistance with hardware/software upgrades. Maintenance-
related tasks require basic "handy" skiJIs like being able to use a hammer, 
climbing a ladder, and infrequent heavy lifiing. 

Once again, I was wrong! 
Their pitching staff not only 

consisted of no Cy Young Award 
Winners, but after Kenny Rogers 
left the team at the trading dead-
line, the Athletics had no pitcher 
with any significant major league 
experience in their starting line-
up. 

Their everyday lineup consist-
ed of only a spattering of veter-
ans, none of whom made an 
abundant contribution to the 
Athletics' chase of the Red Sox for 
the last playoff spot. 

Most of the key contributors 
on Oakland's quest to return to 
the wonder years of 1988-1990 
when they were in the World 
Series every year, were either 
rookies or highly inexperienced 
youngsters playing over their 
heads. Watching these players 
who still play for the love of the 

SPORTS 41 

game made baseball exciting once 
again. 

Some might say that the 
inability of the Athletics to make 
the playoffs proves that it is nec-
essary to spend big money to 
compete in the major leagues. I 
disagree. With a few more timely 
hits, another solid pitching per-
formance and a few breaks going 
their way, the Athletics could 
have beaten out the Red Sox for 
the wild card spot and shocked 
the world, including me, by turn-
ing the tide on the big market 
teams in baseball. 

Will they be able to build on 
this next year? Maybe not. 
Whether or not they do lowe 
them a debt of gratitude for giv-
ing me back the hope that base-
ball can be pure and proving that 
there is still a place for David in a 
league of Goliaths.

Stephens to train UCSD runners 
DEDICATED: Chancellor's 5K record-holder helps train Triton runners 

Staff~ter 

Jim Stephens has found time 
between the charity that he runs 
and the professional athletes 
that he trains to offer a free train-
ing program to UCSD runners 
interested in competing in the 
Oct. 22 Chancellor's 5K, a fund 
raising event for the UCSD 
Undergraduate Scholarship 
Fund. 

Stephens wants to motivate 
students to do as well as they 
can and proposes to help them 
train toward the goal of beating 
the chancellor or his wife, 
physics Professor Frances Dynes 
Hellman. This is an attractive 
idea because Dynes will con-
tribute an additional $25 to the 
fund for all participants who 
beat him. This year, for the first 
time, Hellman will do the same 
for every female participant who 
beats her. 

For Stephens, however, the 
ultimate goal is far more reach-
ing than the 5K run. "The whole 
idea behind the training pro-
gram is to provide a service to 
the students, so that they take 
advantage of the facilities on this 
campus and learn healthy 
habits," he explained. " I don't 
want them to miss this opportu-

C.. nity and become encumbered 
with classes and never know of 
the opportunities they have on 
campus for physical fitness." 

Teresa Bissner is a sophomore 
psychology major at Thurgood 
Marshall College who is training 
with Stephens for the San Diego 
Marathon and the Chancellor 's 
5K run. "He's dedicated to what 
he believes when it comes to 

nutrition and personal fitness," 
she said. "If you want advice on 
what food to eat, he'll tell you 
what he does. He's a good 
example '" and it's helpful to 
know that he's practicing what 
he's preaching." 

Over the next three weeks, 

"The whole idea behind 
the training program is to 
provide a service to the 
students so that they 
take advantage of the 
facilities on this campus 
and learn healthy habits. 
I don't want them to miss 
this opportunity and 
become encumbered 
with classes and never 
know of the opportunities 
they have on campus for 
physical fitness. n 

-.HmSt ......... 

Stephens will be available every 
weekday afternoon and Sunday 
- the main training session -
to coach workouts fur the 
"Challengers," as he calls his 
runners. 

This week there will be ses-
sions both at 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 
p.m. Monday through Friday 
and at noon on Sunday. Those 
interested should meet inside 
the entrance to RJMAC. Next 
week, the sessions will be at the 
time that the most people show 
up to this week. 

Eventually Stephens will 

Law 
land 

Society] 
,,-

divide participanls into groups 
according to their skill levels. He 
expects to have several groups, 
since 70 students signed up just 
during the first three days he 
spent recruiting at RIMAC and 
since turnout for the first ses-
sion, held yesterday at noon, 
was good. 

The training program will 
also be available online, "so 
students don't feel left out if 
they miss a practice," Stephens 
said. "However, if they come to 
the training, it is tailored to 
them. I prefer the more person-
al touch." 

Stephens can often be found 
at RIMAC and is very 
approachable. He is also gener-
ous with his time, a trait 
demonstrated by the success of 
Food For Thought, the charity 
he founded that has given over 
$1 million in food to the poor of 
San Diego. He also coaches 
homeless runners as part of the 
the Homeless Team in Training 
that has been featured in 
RUllller's World and on ESPN 2. 

When he's not donating his 
time or training himself, 
Stephens trains elite athletes 
such as Italian Mirella 
Gandellini, who just won the 
women's long-distance triathlon 
championship in Switzerland, 
and Reto Walser, the second-
ranked Swiss triathlete. 

Anyone interested can sign 
up by contacting Stephens by e-
mail at tri 
sandiego@hotmail.com, or by 
showing up at the entrance to 
RIMAC for any of the training 
sessions. He will also be at a 
table in the Price Center next 
week from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

YOUNG: 
Vicious Hits 
Affecting QB's fate

ers represent. 

Whether the majority of the 
UCSD population and other off-
campus readers agree with me or 
not is unimportant, (What is 
important is my -attempt to add 
zest to your Monday and 
Thursday momings and provide 
variety to the same old highly 
rational analysis.) 

So, here are the thoughts that 
rattled through my head as I 
watched Young attempt to return 
to his feet. 

As Young lay motionless, I 
thought, herr lies olle of the greatest 
nthletes ill sports, practically dead 
011 ti,e field for 15 seconds. 

It made me think about the 
ferocity of the NFL. It made me 
think about the boundaries that 
exist between intense competi-
tion and real life outside the 
realm of the playing field . All his 
glory, his superbowl ring. The 
studly Young who once appeared 
in Time as one of the most beau-
tiful leople in the world. The 
gran master-in-practice of the 
West-Coast offense. There he was 
for a few moments - dead to the 
world. 

I recalled the serious out-
comes of football injuries - the 
Mike Utleys, the Dennis Byrds, 
both of whom were paralyzed on 
the field . It's difficult to visualize 
this sort of injury occurring to 
someone as holy as Young. But I 
imagined it happening and I bet 
some of you did too. 

So, Young. if you're reading 
this for some odd reason, please 
realize that it is time to retire. You 
escaped crippling injury but the 
long-term ramifications to the 
multiple shots to the head that 

Monday, Oclober 4, 1999 

you've received over the last cou-
ple of seasotlS may cut your 
future law practice or even your 
Jjfe short. . 

A heavy-weight fighter is not 
allowed back into the ring for six 
to eight weeks if he's been 
knocked out by an opponent, but 
Young wanted to come back after 
20 minutes. 

Now I know most football 
fans don't know much about 
Young's back-up Jeff Garcia, but 
the Niners have a strong offen-
sive system, with a great coaching 
staff and with mentor Bill Walsh 
serving to instill the West-Coast 
philosophy into Garcia. But no 
matter what the doctors tell him 
and no matter how promising 
Garcia may seem, it will be diffi-
cult for Young to walk awar from 
competing as a pro-footbal quar-
terback. 

Maybe the problem resides in 
the league rulebook's section 
concerning the protection of its 
quarterbacks. There already 
exists the measure that charges a 
IS-yard penalty and pelsonal 
foul to a team whose member 
hits the quarterback with his hel-
met. But this does little to deter 
incidents like Monday night's, hit 
wherein Young was hit and on 
the way down to the turf, 
smashed his head against the 
kneepad of a lineman, causing a 
concussion. 

It may take a devastating 
injury to a quarterback of 
Young's stature for the league to 
instill a no-nonsense rule that 
disallows any contact with the 
quarterback (and I doubt it will 
come to that). It might result in 
less-than-real football but at least 
the starting quarterback wouJd 
be able to get out of bed the fol-
lowing morning. 

Who knows? If football is real-
ly the life-blood that keeps his

Stop Taking 
the Sack 

When Aeneas Williams 
sacks quarterbacks, I hope for 
the sake of Steve Young and 
oth~rs around the league that 
he IS already in a bad mood 
when he gives the big hit. If he 
co.uld get any angrier, which 
maght enable him to hit the 
opposing quarterbacks even 
harder, it might change the 
victims' lives forever or per-
haps kill them. The same goes 
for any defensive back who 
smells blood. 

I also hope that Young had 
a multitude of morbid 
thoughts flash through his 
head as he lay on the surface of 
Sun Devil Stadium last 

~onday night. I hope he real-
Ized that remaining in the 
league much longer could 
mean suffering another blow 
to the head, which could also 
leave him eating the rest of his 
meals through a straw. 

OK. Maybe that's too 
extreme of a projection for the 
fate of the famed 4ger quarter-
back, but I like to make 
extreme _ speculations in this

SHUTOUT: The Triton defense holds strong all game and propels women's soccer to a 2-0 victory 
By ROBERT AlLTON 

Staff~t6r 

Luckily for the UCSD 
women's soccer team, its first-
half performance against 
Chapman University on Friday 
was good enough for a victory _ 
the Tritons downed Chapman 2-0 
at home despite a lackluster sec-
ond period of play. 

"In the first half we were very 
good," said UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus. "The second half 
was dismal. We need to learn to 
play for 90 minutes." 

The Tritons came out of the 
gate with firepower, scoring fast 
and early. UCSD's Emma Borst 
scored her team's first goal at the 
1:38 mark off a pass from team-
mate Lizzy Schilling to give the 
team a very early 1-0 advantage. 

"We were talking beforehand 
to hit them hard early on," said 
Borst of the reason behind her 
team) quick start. "We focused 
on attacking them." 

The Tritons continued their 
first-half dOminance at the 25:46 
ma~k. It was. Shilling again on the 
assist - this time on a comer 
kick, finding teammate Erika 
Alfredson, who increased her 
squad's advantage to 2-0. 

"It's my job," said Alfredson of 
her goal. "Lizzy put it perfect 
across the line for me." 

UCSD had other chances in the 
first half, namely two great runs by 
Christy Abizaid at the 19:43 and 
23:20 marks. Neither runs resulted 
in scores, but it clearly showed the 
Tritons' first-half dominance. 
UCSD constantly pressured the 
Panther defense and goalkeeper 
Catherine Currie. Whenever the 
Tritons were te!lted, the defense 
held toulth. . 

"In tJie first half we played 
great," said McManus. "At the half 
we thought the game was over."
