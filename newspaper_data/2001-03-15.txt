Out-of-State 
Tuition Policies 
Face Lawsuit 
University of Califomia may 
soon become involved 
By MAn SCIWtADER 
Associate News Editor 

The University of California system is fac-
ing a lawsuit over its stringent but potentially 
unconstitutional residency requirements that 
result in out-of-state tuition and fees for some 
California residents. 

"Schools can charge out-of-state tuition," 
said Neal Markowitz, a lawyer for the San 
Diego-based Eppsteiner and Associates law 
firm, which is handling the suit. "just don 't 
charge it to California citizens." 

California students who attend state-run 
universities have their education subsidized 
by the state and federal governments. Because 
out-of-state students do not receive similar 
benefits, the cost of their tuition reflects the 
actual, marginal cost for their education. 

By California state law, it takes less than six 
months to become a California citizen, which 
includes rights such as the right to vote and to 
receive welfare. However, the UC system sets 
residency requirements that are much more 
strict than those of the state. 

In addition to living in California for 12 
months, the UC system requires that students 
must prove they are financially independent 
before they can pay in-state tuition and fees. 

Economics Professor Heller Dies at 59 

To demonstrate this, students are not 
allowed to leave California for more than six 
weeks during the year in which they are trying 
to become residents, and they must not have 
received more than $750 per year for the pre-
vious three years from their guardians. In 
addition, they must submit a copy of their 
guardians' tax statement. Heller helped build the UCSD economics department These rules prohibit students who want to 
become California residents from taking 
advantage of opportunities outside of the 
state. 

ByDANAWDT 
Contributing News Writer 

The UCSD community was saddened by the 
loss of longtime economics professor Walter 
Perrin Heller to pancreatic cancer March 2. He 
was 59. 

Heller made many contributions to UCSD 
during his residency, which began in 1974 after 
he left the University of Pennsylvania's econom-
ics department. 

As an early member of the UCSD econom-
ics faculty, Heller played an active role in shap-
ing the department. He was involved in 

research, teaching and campus land-use plan-
ning, and was distinsuished in the Academic 
Senate as the chairman of the Campus 
Community and Environment Committee. On 
the committee, Heller helped plan construction 
projects for the development of the UCSD cam-
pus. 

It is this sphere of Heller's work that is, as 
friend and colleague Ross Starr stated, "his most 
visible contribution to the UCSD campus." 

Theodore Groves, a colleague of Heiler's, 
said that "Walter had a deep sense of responsi-

UC System, Enron Dispute Energy Contract 
During recent energy crisis, power provider asked universities to revert back to local meters 
ByIDWU 
Slaff Writer 

The University of California 
and California State University 
systems filed legal action against 
Enron Energy Services in the U.S. 
District Court in Oakland 
~~ndar, asking for a preliminary 
injunction to prevent Enron from 
what· the University of California 
alleges ·unilaterally alters the con-
tract under which Enron delivers 
electrical power and other services 
to the two university systems." 

Enr'On denies these all~gations, 

maintaining that it ·continues to 
honor the financia l and other 
terms of its agreement with 
Uc/CSU: 

. The dispute stems from a 1998 
contract that specified that UC and 
CSU would become "direct access 
customers" of Houston-based 
Enron. Under the contract, Enron 
provides electricity to the two uni-
versity systems at discounted costs 
and helps to install special meter-
ing systems and conservation pro-
grams on the individual campuses, 
bypassing utilities such as Pacific 
Gas and Electric, Southern 

California Edison and San Diego 
Gas and Electric. The long-term, 
low-cost power contract was 
allowed by the implementation of 
deregulation laws at the time. 

At the height of the power crisis 
in February, Enron asked the UC 
and CSU systems to switch their 
meters from the high-tech meters 
linked to Enron's system back to 
meters that would make the indi-
vidual campuses customers of their 
respective local utilities. 

"This move by Enron to escape 
the requirements of the UC-CSU 
contract would mean higher prof-

its for Enron, but it has the poten-
tial for costing California students, 
parents and taxpayers hundreds of 
millions of dollars in additional 
expenses: said joe Mullinix, UC 
senior vice president of business 
and finance. 

UC alleges that the motive 
behind what it deems "a breach of 
contract" is the pursuit of profit by 
Enron, which, if successful, could 
sell on the California "spot mar-
ket" the electricity that was previ-
ously reserved for the UC campus-

being a California citizen. 

" I am a registered voter of California 
and pay California taxes, yet I still have 
to pay out-of-state tuition," said Muir 
sophomore Steve Reis, a native of 
Arizona. "This system is absurd." 

Reis has not been financially inde-
pendent from his parents for three 
years. Therefore, he is required to pay 
the additional $9,000 per year to attend 
UCSD as an out-of-state student, 
regardless of his California citizenship. 

Currently, Josh Markowitz, a third-
year graduate student at UC Hastings 
School of Law, is suing the Hastings 
Board of Education under similar cir-
cumstances. 

As a new California citizen, 
Markowitz filed suit against Hastings, 
stating that the UC requirements arc 
unconstitutional, and that he should 
not have to pay the extra $11 ,232 per 
ye<lr In tUition that results from his out-
of-state status. 

The fact that Hdstings is it three-
year school makes it impossible for new 
California residents to garner the 
opportunity to pay in-state tuition and 
fees, due to the school's requirement 
that a 5tudem must not have received a 
payment of more thall $750 from his 
guardian in the last three years. 

Those anending Hastings who did 
their undergraduate work in a S(,1te 
other than California do not usually 
have the chance to qualifY for in-state 
tuition and fees, because their parents 
likely supported them during their 
undergraduate studies. 

These discrepancies have been 
ca lled unconstitutional by the

Research Shows Spine Can Heal Itself 
Scientists at the UCSD School of Medicine 

and the Veteran 's Affairs Medical Center have 
found that rats with spinal cord injuries can 
recover motor skills after just a few weeks due 
to spontaneous growth of the injured nerves. 

The findings were published in the March 13 
issue of the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences. The article states that 
sCientists removed spinal cord connr ~tions from 
the rats, which soon recovered coordinated 
forepaw movement. 

The scientists believe that these findings 
indicate self-regeneration of the nerves, because 
40 percent of humans who suffer from nerve 
damage in the spinal cord or from head trauma 
also spontaneously recover motor function. 

Next , scientists will test whether their find-
ings can lead' to the development of techniques 
to ensure even more rapid recovery. 

The study was conducted in the lab of UCSD 
associate professor of neurosciences Mark 
Tuszynski, with the assistance of UCSD depart-
ment of neurosciences researchers Norbert 
Weidner, Arvin Ner and Nima Salimi.

Kurt Benirschke from the San Diego Zoo will

mals at the zoo and the training techniques 
used to teach the dogs to work with the ani-
mals. The ceremony will feature a puppy kiss-

Study Finds Mood Effects 
of Exercise May be Short-LIved 

A study at the UCSD School of Medicine has 
found that ceasing exercise also stops its mood-
enhancing effects. 

The study was published in the March 15 
issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology. 
The new information confirmed the researchers ' 
hypothesis. 

The pool of elderly participants were chosen 
from the northern San Diego community of 
Rancho Bernardo. The study followed their exer-
cise habits through two time intervals, 1984 to 
1987 and 1992 to 1995. 

The study used the Beck Depression 
Inventory to assess the participants ' moods as 
they worked out three times a week. The study 
assessed the participants some time later and 
found that those who were sti ll exercising were 
generally happier. 

UCSD associate professor of family and pre-
ventative riledicine Donna Kritz-Silverstein , 
Elizabeth Barrett-Connor and Catherine Corbeau 
conducted the study. 

Heparin May Stop Cancer 
from Spreading In Mice 

Researchers at the UCSD Cancer Center have 
found that the common drug heparin may stop 
the spread of cancer in mice by blocking inter-
action of normal blood cells and tumor cell mol-
ecules. 

Past research with animals and heparin 
showed that the drug slows metastasis, the 
process by which tumor cells enter the blood-
stream. However, studies using the drug have all 
but stopped, due to some unsuccessful attempts 
at the use of oral forms of the drug. 

Ajit Varki authored the study with the help of 
postdoctoral fellow Lubor Borsig . 

. - in the Mar. 12 Letter to the Editor, "Claims of Being Unsafe Misplaced," the Guardian Incorrect-
ly used "Muir College Council" in place of "Muslim Cultural Club" when referring to the sponser of 
Anti-Zionism Week .

Stapling Condoms 
To Discourage Sex: 
Logic Full of Holes 

[n Monday's issue of tile Guardian, a news 
story was written about a group of Visual 
Arts 2 students who passed out condoms 
punctured with staples on Library Walk last 
Wednesday. 

The group apparently got the condoms 
from Student Health Services and used the 
stapled condoms to make a statement about 
the risks that people make when they have 
sex while using a condom. Although the 
Guardian believes in the right of free speech, 
we also think that the actions that this group 
took to make its point were both ill-advised 
and shameful. 

First of all, the group used condoms that 
were handed out by Student Health Ser-
vices in an attempt to lower the transmis-
sion of sexually transrpitted diseases and the 

in~tances of conception. It was not appro-
pnate for condoms that are paid for with 
student fees to be destroyed so that a small 
group of students could have their opinion 
heard. Just as it wouldn't be OK for the 
group to write out their argument on the 
walls of a kcture hall in spray paint, it is not 
acceptable for them to destroy materials 
b?ught for the good of the university. This 
display was not an approved expenditure of 
those funds and should not have occured. 

Secondly, there is now an unknown 
quantity of condoms on campus that cannot 
prevent pregnancy or the transmission of a 
dis~ase. The st~tement that this group was 
trymg to make IS not lost on the members of 
the Guardian editorial board, and while 
nobody would doubt that abstinence is 
much safer then protected sex, the damage 
done by this group was much greater than 
any good they may have caused. Although 
most people understand that condoms with 
staples in them are unusable, some people 
may not. This presents an obvious danger. 
Also, if the staples are pulled out of the con-
doms, it would be almost impossible to see 
the small holes that the punctures would 
leave. If not properly disposed of, these con-
doms could easily be mistaken for unpunc-
tured condoms, anq used as such. 

Further, by the time students reach college 
everybody understands the risks involved 
with sex, both protected and not. This art 
pr?ject really did nothing to increase the con-
sCiousness of the public about the problems 
ass?ciated with sexual promiscuity. Their 
actlons could have serious consequences for 
students that are fooled by the punctured 
condoms. This "art" project was an exercise 
that should never have taken place, and co'uld 
cause considerable damage to individual lives.

History of Student Government 101: 
How to Grade Your Elected Officials 

Part one of a series documenting the labors of your A.S. executive cabinet

ed we stand, and all together now, we 

p~sh, a.nd ... oh bother, I've gone and 
mixed It all up again. As if it wasn't 
already hard enough to keep four classes 
worth of information straight, every win-
ter.quarter we have to go into finals week 
try 109 to sort out who's running with 
who and for what and on which slate in 
the A.S. Council elections. 

If you. haven't seen the posters, fly-
ers, T-shirts and tattoos proclaiming 
the start of the yearly race to see who

dent government fees, then you're 
blinder than a bat with its eyes poked 
out by one of those cool pencils 
engraved with "vote for me: 

What you m2y not know, unless I tell 
you (and boy am I gonna) is what the 
jobs really are, and how well they got 
done by the motley crew you elected last

Russian roullette, too. 

Speaking of shooting yourself in the 
head, that's exactly what I asked a hand-
ful of current A.S. Council members to 
do. I asked A.S. Council President Doc

Eugene Mahmoud, Commissioner of 
Judicial Affairs Amy Kuo. Commissioner

sioner of Communications Ram i 
Sharaawy to grade themselves on their 
service in office thus far. 

I chose them on the basis of the fol-
lowing crit~~ia : They hold all-campus 
elected positions; they are not running 
for . re-election; they returned my e-
mails. 

. As starved for attention and appreci-
ation as our A.S. Council members are 
they came through for me. Heck, if i; 
weren't for the stomach flu I picked up 
at the Rathskellar, this article would 
write itself.

On this, I give Khaleghi his lowest 
grade, a C- for amazingly weak and 
undefined promises. When you see 
candidates offering ~ousing, parking or 
athletlcs as campaign promises, kick 
'em in the shin. These are standing 
areas of advocacy for A.S. Council 
members. It's as if ~ U.S. president 
could get away with promising not to 
allow any foreign countries to invade 
the country. 

That said, Khaleghi has accomplished 

a great deal in these areas. He has tried to 
revise the system that the UC Office of 
the President uses to estimate living 
expenses. If this multi-campus, long-
term effort succeeds, it will result in mil-
lions more financial aid dollars at every 
campus. 

Khaleghi has actually managed to get 
200 more yellOW spaces, and has been 
effective in advocating other areas of 

thi~ issue. He also played a hand in cre-
ating our new and dearly beloved mas-
cot. 

As A.S. C~uncil presi~ent, Khaleghi 
~as bee.n a htghly effective gadfly. His 
Impresstve people skills and determina-
tion have earned him (and us) far reach-
ing success, including another shot at 
an all-campus commencement, a possi-
ble malO campus trolley station, and a 

. revision (still in the works) of the Stu-
dent Organization Funding Advisory 
Board. 

He merits an A- for these efforts. 
As a galvanizer, Khaleghi has a poor-

er track record. Despite taking office 
With a huge portion of his "Indepen-
dent" slate, Khaleghi's council has 
shown none of the focused energy and 
.strength voters expect from a landslide 

p~rtisan victory. I give Khaleghi a B- for 
hts competent but not dynamic leader-
ship of his council. 

,,\11 together, I agree with Khaleghi 's 
self-tmposed grade of a B. He may be in 
USA Today's top 100 sty..dents, but he has 
~nly partially fulfilled his office's poten-
tlal. But he ain't done yet! Expect to see a 
great deal more from him in the coming 
weeks. 

As yeu consider this year's candidates 
for Khaleghi's job, consider the balance 
they will have to strike between macro-
advocacy and micro-management When 
they come knocking at your door to 
drum up votes, ask them how they feel 
about everythmg that bugs you, and lis-
ten closely. Do they have real inforrna-

ti~n, .or just an opinion they know you

Media Loses Sight of Fair Reporting 
Coverage of Santee's school shooting raises serious questions 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

A fast-paced frenzy that lasts, 
uninterrupted, for days - and 
then, quiet. 

In the hours that followed last 
week's shooting at Santana High 
School in Santee, local and then 
national news channels broadcast-
ed live, gripping footage. Soon the 
airwaves were abuzz with experts 
offering analysis and pundits toss-
ing out opinions. 

Once again, as we have seen 
before in incidences of school 
shootings, accusations flew. Fears 
were voiced. A call to arms was 
issued. It seemed all at once as if 
the entire American population 
had devoted its energy to this 
pressing societal problem. 

And then, all at once, silence 
descended . Americans looked 
away from Santana and returned 
to their daily lives, where, God 
willing, school shootings were not 
an immediate concern. 

This is the cycle that has repeat-
_ ed itself through all of the recent 

school shootings: a flurry of 
exploitative, repetitive "coverage" of 
the incident, and then its rapid rel-
egation to back-page follOW-Ups 
and our distant memory. Yet the 
media's treatment of this issue has a 
long-lasting effect on us, whether 
we acknowledge that or not, and 
that effect is for the worse. 

Anyone who flicked on the 
television on the morning or after-
noon of March 5 was assaulted by 
images of Santee, and the tour 
guides through the disorganized 
crowds and confusing information 
were the newscasters "live on the 
scene: Yet these journalists were 
less interested in presenting a 
well-informed picture of the 

events at hand than in edging out 
their broadcast competition by 
providing the rawest, most atten-
tion-getting footage. 

One local reporter approached 
a woman who was sobbing 
uncontrollably, searching the faces 
of the teens that passed by, proba-
bly for her own <:hild; he promptly 
thrust his microphone in her face 
and said, "Excuse me, ma'am, I see 
that tears are streaming down 
your face ... could you tell me 
what you're feeling right now?" 
The motivation was clear: He was 

Perhaps the most tragic 
and sinister repercussion 
of the media's 
exploitative and 
haphazard coverage of 
school shootings ... , is the 
propogation of copycat 
mmes. 

pursuing the juiciest quote possi-
ble for the 6 o'clock news, and in 
an insensitive, intruding manner. 

There is a standard guideline in 
journalism: "If it bleeds, it leads: In 
the wake of violent and affecting 
school shootings, reporters exploit 
the suffering of the victims and 
their distraught families for ratings. 

The media figureheads are also 
guilty of clouding the issue of the 
causes of school shootings. The 
wild and contradictory specula-
tion of pundits and so-called 
"experts" serves no purpose but to 
confirm the preconceived beliefs 

. of viewers and readers, and it can' 
even give them mistaken impres-

sions of the conditions surround-
ing an incident. 

In his March 6 column in the 
Union-Tribune, Peter Rowe 
assigned racial motivations to the 
Santana shooting, citing a recent 
study about racism in Santee 
(which is unflatteringly called 
"Klan tee" by its detractors). How-
ever, there is no evidence whatso-
ever that Andy Williams, the San-
tana shooter, chose his victims 
based on their race or ethnicity, or 
that he indeed exercised anything 
other than a random selection of 
convenient targets. 

By furthering an explanation 
that has no basis in fact, writers 
and commentors only muddy the 
waters and make any genuine 
investigation and exploration 
impossible. 

Perhaps the most tragic and 
sinister repercussion of the 
media's exploitative and haphaz-
ard coverage of school shootings, 
such as that at Santana High , is 
the propagation of copycat 
crimes. Media outlets romanti-
cize the killers in these cases, 
running in-depth biographies on 
them and making them house-
hold names. (Who didn't know 
the life stories of Columbine 
shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric 
Harris last year?) This obsession 
with teens who were formerly on 
the fringe of their narrow school 
societies is enough to ca use 
other alienated youths to idolize 
the murderers. 

Indeed, a Maryland 18-year-
old was arrested last week for 
sending threatening e-mails to 
two girls from Santee, boasting 
that he was "finishing what Andy 
started: Authorities could find

OPINION 5 

Taking for Granted the 
Freedoms Denied to Others 

Speak Up, 
Speak Out! 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

I can't help but wonder if we as a society take our lives and the freedoms we enjoy every 
day for granted. 

Do we even fully realize the 
phenomenal freedoms that we 
exercise every waking minute? 

I submit that it isn 't an issue we 
spend much time probing because 
we have become accustomed to the 
absolute freedom to control our 
lives; because of the fact that we 
have the freedom of protected lib-
erty, and possess the freedom to 
pursue our happiness in whatever 
we choose. 

Despite all the bad things that 
we read about in our papers every 
day, we actually do have a wonder-
fullife. 

However, not everyone in this 
great big world is as lucky as 
Americans are. Imagine, if you 
will , that you or a close friend has 
just been brutally raped. 

ow banish from your mind 
the immediate available medical, 
victim, legal and psychological 
services that are available in the 
United States. 

Next, banish from your mind 
the fact that the law enforcement 
agencies in the United States will 
go after the rapist, who, if caught, 
will ·then face legal punishments. 

Now imagine that once it 
becomes known you or your close 
friend has been raped, the law pur-
sues the victim. 

Imagine you. the victim, is then 

killed for shaming your family'S 
honor. 

A woman is raped , then is 
killed; what could possibly be the 
rationale behind this abhorrent 
and chilling action? 

In many Middle Eastern coun-
tries, "honor killing" is the age-old 
practice of killing women who have 
shamed the family name by com-
mitting adultery, not marrying the 
bridegroom chosen by her parents, 
having premarital sex and even for 
being raped. 

Even the merest suspicion of 
sexual activity can warrant a 
woman's death in the name of 
"family honor: 

The worst of it is that the 
killings often remain a private fam-
ily matter and usually the murderer 
is considered innocent and even a 
"hero," often allowed to walk free 
without any punishment. 

The first thought you might 
have is that this obviously can not 
be true - that it must be an 
ancient custom that is no longer in 
practice. Sadly, this practice is very 
much a reality. 

According to the Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan in its 
annual report on the state of 
human rights in their country, it 
was reported that around 1,000 
women were victims of "honor 
killings" in ~999 . 

In the August 1999 repQrt, the 
Human Rights Watch condemned 
the "honor killings" that take place 
in Jordan. 

This international monitoring 
group cited the killing of 11 
women 1999 (through August), in 
the name of "family honor," and 
criticized Jordan 's government for

Technology is No Substitute for the Real World Media: 
Coverage of recent events 
unfairly gforijies murderers Society's dependence on computers poses a significant risk to human relations 

By ANDREW QUADRI 
Staff Writer 

You may be reading this as you 
wait for class to begin. Or you 
could be reading this on a com-
puter screen at 2 a.m. It 's the same 
story, but the settings are of two 
very different worlds. 

If you are reading this in our 
prin t edition, you are probably 
su rrounded by other students who 
are reading the same paper. Maybe 
they're reading th is article 100. If 
you're reading this online, you are 
probably alone in your room. 
Maybe you're listening to music. 

thers might be reading this art i-
cle at the same lime, but you have 
no way of knowing it. . 

The new millennium almost 
seems like a letdown. It's 2001 and 
the only space odyssey around 
involves the Russians and their 
self-destructing Mir. No one flies 
around in "Jetson mobiles," either. 
Reality bites, doesn't it? Reality 
bitrs, but soon we may not have to 
deal wi th it. Soon, we will be able 
to spend our lives in a digitally 
created world. 

Despite the decline of thc tech 
market, 2001 is significan t 
because it will go down in history 
as the true beginning of the Digi-
tal Age. It will be the end of tradi-
tional socializing and community, 
ilnd the beginning of virtual reali ty 
as a sui,>stitute for the real thing. 

It 's the reality of life in 21st-
century America. Our "society" is 
moving toward IO tal privacy. This 
1V0rries me 

Almost daily, I see someone on 
Library Walk who appears 10 be 
talking 10 himself: He isn't crazy; 

he's talking on an almost-invisible 
phone. He is "connected," and yet 
he is disconnected from the world 
around him. 

Like each previous technologi-
cal revolution, the Digital Age has 
quietly engulfed us. We didn't ask 
for this deluge of information and 
electronic devices, but it evolved 
over time and we evolved with it. 

I am part of the last generation 
of Americans to grow up without a 
personal Internet connection . 
During my junior year of high 
school. I finally got "connected," 

world, one door down from yours. 
You don't hear "there goes the 
neighborhood" very often any-
more, because it packed up and 
left a very long time ago. 

Rising political apathy in 
America is not surprising. As our 
world becomes increasingly pri-
vate, public issues mean less. Most 
people don't care about the gov-
ernment unless it wants to 
increase taxes or dump toxic waste 
on their front lawns. Only then are 
politics worth dealing with. 

One of the special qualities of 
but children now 
are on the com-
puter long before 
they're in kinder-
garten. This wor-
ries me. 

Children in the 
United States 
don't know any 
other way of life. 
As fa r as they're 
concerned, the 
Internet is as 
remarkable as a 
peanut butter 
sa ndwich . This 
also worries me. 

[worry about what 
virtual existence 
means for the real 
world ... If we cross 
over to a 
predominantly 
digital existence, are 
any of us going to 
want to come back 
to the real world? 

computers is that 
they allow us to 
turn our private 
world on and off 
whenever we 
please. Problems 
need not exist in 
cyberspace. If an 
argument is brew-
ing between you 
and another Inter-
net user, you can 
simply log off. You 
never have to deal 
with another per-
son's feelings if 
you don't want to. 

The Internet is 
often hailed as a breakthrough in 
communication, but that's not 
necessarily positive. There is noth-
ing so great about talking to peo-
ple across the world when it 
means that you no longer talk to 
your next-door neighbors. 

Traditional community is on 
the way out. The rise of suburbia 
was the first strike agai nst it. In 
many cases, neighbors now are 
not friends but simply other peo-
ple dwelling in their own private 

. That you may have 
never seen this person's face 
makes it even easier to do just 
that. 

The human mind doesn't just 
like simulated situations; it 
comes to prefer them. In an age 
of unlimited possibilities in the 
virtual world, reality is no longer 
a priority. Virtual reality makes 
the impossible possible, as long 
as it doesn 't mean dealing with 
real problems. 

Virtual reality can't end pover-

ty and it can't enp hunger, but it 
can blanket us in the feeling that 
these problems don't exist. Virtual 
reality can't make death painless, 
but it can numb us to the feelings 
associated with it. Again, this wor-
ries me. 

Millions of video games can 
simulate ki lling another creature, 
but no video game forces you to 
deal with the real-life conse-
quences of taking a life. In the vir-
tual world, there are only simulated 
consequences. The reset button 
takes care of everything. For a lot of 
people, this is the perfect existence. 

For now, virtual reality is limit-
ed to video games and the Inter-
net, but change is coming. Any 
experience will be able to be 
reproduced. Technology will 
evolve past simulating reality and 
on to simulating experiences that 
are better than the real thing. 

The line between the virtual 
and real world is blurring. I worry 
about what virtual existence 
means for the future of the real 
world. Will the real world 
become a massive inner city to 
the suburbs of hyper-reality? If 
we cross over to a predominantly 
digital existence, are any of us 
going to want to come back to 
the real world? 

The evolving Digital Age keeps 
barreling ahead, with little regard 
for what it leaves in its wake. 
Before we decide to plug in any 
further, I urge us to take a look at 
the reality we are leaving behind. It 
is imperfect, to be sure, but that is 
the way life was intended. As a 
society, we should think about hit-
ting the reset button before it is 
too late.

no personal link between the 
sender and Williams - in short, 
the only way he knew of the case 
was through what he read in the 
newspapers and saw on television . 
This illustrates a frightening trend 
wherein violence inspires vio-
lence. The media's focus on and 
glorification of the shooters in 
cases such as Columbine and 
Santana causes such a cycle. 

Obviously, it would be ridicu-
lous to blame atrocious acts such 
as school shootings on the media 
alone (or on music with explicit 
lyrics, or video games with stylized 
violence, for that matter) . However, 
reporters and commentors are irre-
sponsibly and unethically address-
ing these events. While some would 
argue that reporters are merely 
responding to the public's desire, 
this justification makes journalism 
out to be a product for the con-
sumption of the masses, and not 
the responsible watchdog it should 
be. 

So now that the last student 
memorial service has ended, and 
the pundits have spoken their 
pieces and received their pay-
checks, the media circus has 
packed up its tents and left San 
Diego county to its own dev.ices. 
We are left dazed , unsure of how 
to proceed; we are jaded and cyn-
ical in the face of another all -too-
familiar attack; we are worried; we 
arc forgetting as we speak. The 
media has abandoned its obliga-
tion to inform us, choosing 
instead to entertain us with suf-
fering and woo us with empty 
explanations.

Imagine you have just been con-

As reported by the Associated 
Press wire service May 1, 2000, a 
recent example of this practice was 
when Afghanistan's hard-line Tal-
iban religious leaders stoned a 
woman named Suriya to death 
after she was convicted of adultery. 
The stoning was conducted in a 
dramatic public display at a sports 
stadium before a crowd of several 
thousand spectators.

must take place. Married offend-
ers who commit adultery may be 
punished by stoning regardless of 
their gender, but the method laid 
down for a man involves his bur-
ial up to his waist, and· for a 
woman up to her neck (Article 
102). 

Art icle 104 of the Law of 
Hodoud provides that the stones 
should not be so large that a per-
son dies after being hit with two of 
them, nor so small as to be defined 
as pebbles, but must cause severe 
injury. 

This makes it clear that the pur-
pose of stoning is to inflict grievous 
pain on the victim, in a process 
leading to his or her slow death. 

Though the Iranian law 
requires stoning death for either 
male or fema le offenders, the 
majority of the cases involving 
stonings involve women. 

Amnesty International reported 
July 14, 1995, that two women by 
the names Saba Abdali, 30, and 
Zeinab Heidary, 38, were stoned in 
the city of lIam Gharb of Iran after 
being accused of committing adul-
tery. 

In another horrifying case, 
Reuters reported Dec. 7, 1994, that 
a married woman was stoned to 
death in the city of Ramhormouz, 
in southwestern Iran . 

These brutal cases illustrate the 
fact that the women in these coun-
tries do not have the rights to life, 
to liberty, or to pursue their happi-
ness - the very rights we take for 
granted in the course of our daily 
life. 

It is simply beyond my capaci-
ty to be able to imagine how it 
would be possible to live in a 
country in which I would be killed 
by my own family members if I

were raped or fell in love with the 
• wrong boy. 

These harsh and inherently 
unjust actions by these countries 
only serve to reinforce my belief 
in how lucky I am to be living in 
the "grand 01''' United States. It 
makes me aware that every day I 
truly do breathe in the air of free -
dom. 

Our constitutional gifts of free-
dom protect us from each other 
and from our government. In our 
remarkable society, victims have 
the rights to life, liberty and pursuit 
of happiness, and above all, are 
protected from further victimiza-
tion . 

Thus, with each day, remember 
that we have been blessed with a 
exceptionally wonderful life. For 
we enjoy something many other 
countries only dream about: free-
dom.

~D & NATION 
Bush Goes Back on Promise, Says He 
Won't Regulate Greenhouse Emissions 

WASHINGTON - Bowing to 
pressure from conservative Repub-
licans and industry groups, 
President Bush disowned a cam-
paign pledge Tuesday and said he 
would not seek to regulate power 
plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, 
a gas that many scientists say is a 
key contributor to global warming. 

The decision angered environ-
mental groups and some congres-
sional Democrats, who called it a 
major betrayal. But the White 
House said a Cabinet-level review 
concluded that Bush's original 
promise was inconsistent with the 
broader goal of increasing domes-
tic ~nergy production. 

The president outlined his 
new view in a letter to four 
Republican senators -Jesse Helms 
of North Carolina, Chuck Hagel 
of Nebraska. Pat Roberts of 
Kansas, and Larry Craig of Idaho 
- whose criticisms of Bush's ini-
tial plan had been among protests 
by conservatives and industry 
leaders who claimed that efforts 
to regulate carbon dioxide emis-
sions could damage the energy 
industry and the U.S. economy. 

Less than two weeks ago, 
Christie Whitman, the administra-
tor of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, described 

Bush's campaign promise as if it 
were already policy. Any plan to 
regulate carbon dioxide emissions 
would have mainly burdened coal-
burning power plants. Bush said 
Tuesday that a new Department of 
Energy study concluded that reg-
ulating carbon dioxide emissions 
would lead to "significantly higher 
electricity prices." 

Bush said Tuesday 
a new Department of 
Energy study concluded 
that regulating carbon 
dioxide emissions would 
lead to 'significantly 
higher electricity prices,' 

"This is important new infor-
mation that warrants a re-evalua-
tion, especially at a time of rising 
energy prices and a serious energy 
shortage: Bush said. 

Pressure to make the decision 
came in part from lobbyists for 
coal companies and utilities 
dependent on coal, but also from 
the conservative wing of the 
Republican Party, who saw any 
move to regulate carbon dioxide 

as an implicit endorsement of the 
goals of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The Kyoto Protocol, negotiat-
ed and signed by the Clinton 
administration but as Xet unrati-
fied, would commit 38 industrial-
ized countries to sharp, ongoing 
cuts in carbon dioxide emissions. 

Bush's earlier embrace of the 
plan won him praise from envi-
ronmental leaders, who described 
the approach as an indication that 
the administration might be more 
sympathetic than expected toward 
policies to address global warm-
ing and to meet other environ-
mental goals. 

Perhaps for that reason. the 
representatives of environmental 
organizations denounced Bush's 
turnaround in bitter terms. 

"Bush is turning his back not 
only on his campaign pledge. but 
on his administrator of the EPA 
and the world's scientists, who 
warn this problem is more serious 
than we previously thought: said 
Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scien-
tist for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, a private envi-
ronmental group.

North Korea Suddenly Cancels 
Peace Talks with South Korea 

SEOUL, South Korea -
North Korea Tuesday abruptly 
postponed meetings planned for 
this week between North and 
South Korean Cabinet members 
on major topics affecting inter-
Korean relations. 

I n a terse telephone message 
to the North-South liaison office 
at the truce village of Panmun-
jom, a Northern official said only 
that "a number of circumstances" 
were responsible for causing a 
delay in the talks, South Korean 
officials said . 

Caught off guard by the 
North's decision, South Korea 's 
unification minister, Park Jae-kyu, 
responded by saying he hoped 
that the two sides would agree on 
another date "as soon as possible." 

The two sides were to have 
spent four days discussing such 
matters as arrangements for the 
next round of visits by members 
of families divided by the Korean 
War, and plans for linking the 
railroad between North and 
South. 

There was speculation here 

that the North, by canceling the 
meeting, was sending a clear sig-
nal that its leader, Kim Jong II, was 
unhappy about comments in 
Washington last week by 
President Bush after a meeting 
with President Kim Dae-jung of 

"The North needs time 
to think about its 
strategy about how to 
deal with the United 
States as well as Korea. " 

-10 ...........

South Korea. 
Bush said he had "some skep-

ticism about the leader of North 
Korea; particularly when it came 
to honoring agreements. The 
United States signed an agree-
ment with North Korea in Geneva 
in 1994 under which it abandoned 
plutonium processing at a sus-

pected nuclear weapons plant in 
return for the promise of con-
struction of twin nuclear reactors 
to help fill the North's energy 
needs. Tho senior administration 
officials said later that there was 
no evidence that North Korea was 
violating the agreement. 

South Korean officials 
searched for reasons other than 
North Korean anger with Bush for 
the cancellation of the meetings. 
One theory was that the man who 
was to head the North's delega-
tion. Jon Kum Jin. might be 
severely ill. 

Analysts also suggested that 
the North might be in a policy: 
quandary. 

"The North needs time to 
think about its strategy about how 
to deal with the United States as 
well as South Korea," said Kim 
Sung-han, professor at the 
Institute of Foreign Affairs and 
National Security, an adjunct of 
South Korea's foreign ministry.

deceit to witness tampering, as he 
contended that Combs had fired a 
gun at the ceiling of Club New 
York, a Manhattan nightclub, dur-
ing an argument between his 
entourage and a club patron. Then, 
he said, Combs fled in his Lincoln 
Navigator, tossing his weapon from 
the window. 

Departing from a theory he had 
advanced during the seven-week 
trial, Bogdanos said that the gun the 
police had found beneath the front 
passenger seat of the Navigator . 
belonged to Combs' bodyguard. 
Anthony Jones. Jones, he said, 
lacked the "brain" of Combs, who 
he said had wiped his gun clean of 
fingerprints and thrown it from the 
vehicle. This gun, he said, was the 
one later found by a passerby on 
Eighth Avenue. 

Jones is also charged with gun 
possession and bribery; he is 
accused of joining Combs in

With 20 percent of its adults infect-

"The incidence is persuasive in 
itself; Mbeki said in remarks to 
Parliament Wednesday afternoon. 
"Accordingly, we do not need to 
declare a national emergency to 
underscore the point." 

In cases of national emergency 
or ,circumstances of extreme 
urgency, the World Trade 
Organization allows copies of the 
life-saving drug cocktails to be 
imported and produced without 
the consent of the multinational 
drug makers holding the patents. 

Advocates for patients with 
AIDS said they did not believe the 
decision would hurt efforts to 
import and produce cheaper ver-
sions of drugs under patent. And 
officials said they were not backing 
away from their support of com-
pulsory licensing, which allows the 
government to seize patents in spe-
cial circumstances.

health official praised Cipla Ltd .. of

attempted murder. 

Barrow shot his own gun three 
times, hitting three patrons in the 
club, Bogdanos asserted. He dis-
counted the ddense argument that 
Barrow had carried and fired his 
gun in self-defense. MWhy else 
would you carry an illegal gun?" he 
asked. "An ornament to match the 
outfit of the evening? You carry it 
to use it." 

Barrow, . in a white shirt but-
toned to the collar and no tie, occa-
sionally glanced up from a Bible 
and mouthed words. 

In midafternoon, the jurors 
learned that Bogdano~ was not fin-
ished with his statement, as he had 
predicted he would be, but had one 
more hour, and that they would 
not receive instructions from 
Justice Charles Solomon of state 
Supreme Court in Manhattan. As 
Bogdanos continued into the 
evening, lacing his remarks with 
calls to honor and snippets of 
Elizabethan poetry, he accused 
defense witnesses of colluding with 
Combs and lying on the stand. 

The jury is expected to receive 
legal instructions Wednesday 
morning and then to begin deliber-
ations.

facturer, for requesting permission 
of government to sell generic ver-
sions of eight of 15 HIV drugs that 
are priced far above what most 
South Africans can afford. This 
official, Ayanda Ntsaluba, director 
general of the Department of 
Health, said he was hopeful that 
other producers-of generic drugs 
would join in the request. which is 
going through the courts, with a 
hearing set for April. 

South Africa's patent law allows 
government officials and private 
parties to ask a patent commission-
er to seize patents from companies 
that cannot meet demand for vital 
products. The commissioner can 
compel patent-holders to grant 
licenses to competitors that can 
meet national needs. 

The $overnment has never used 
this secbon of the law, out of fear of 
retaliation from governments act-
ing in behalf of South Africa's trad-
ing partners; they threatened sanc-
tions when the idea was debated a 
few years ago. That pressure has 
faded with recognition of the scale 
of the epidemic. And government 
officials said they would not rule 
out using their own powers - as 
outlined under the patent act - to 
request compulsory licensing.

EnrOll: 
Enron guaranteed that 
prices would not change 

the energy earmarked for the UC 
and CSU systems would already 
be sold on the spot market by 
Enron, and Enron would have to 
procure energy for the university 
systems elsewhere. 

"Enron does not have and is 
therefore not reselling power pre-
viously purchase to serve 
UC/CSU; Mahoney said in 
response to UC's allegations. 

Heller: 
Pmfessor was widely 
praised by colleagues 
Cc:c ... s.d .......... l 
bility to (the Campus Community 
and Environment Committee) ." 

According to Groves, Heller was 
instrumental in creating UCSD's 
current master plan for develop-
ment. The master plan is responsi-
ble for the five, soon to be six, col-
leges at UCSD and linking them in 
a way that accommodates pedestri-
ans and vehicular traffic. 

Heller was widely praised by his 
students and colleagues as an econ-
omist with solutions to economic 
problems that no textbook could 
solve. Heller's teaching centered 
around economic policy and the 
effective allocation of resources in 
government services and the envi-
ronment. 

As a teacher and an economist, 
Heller was devoted to ensuring that 
UCSD economics students 
received the best education possi-
ble. 

"Walter cared deeply about eco-

UCSD alone saved $12.3 mil-
lion as a result of the contract in 
the eight months between April 
and November of last year. While 
San Diego energy prices skyrock-
eted last summer before the rest 
of the state's prices, savings across 
all the campuses during the ener-
gy crisis were a likely result of the 
contract with Enron. 

Enron denies that shifting 
campuses back over to utilities is 
its goal. Instead, Mahoney blames 
the California state Legislature for 
suspending direct access, a critical 
part of deregulation, as an option 
for customers during the latest 
power crisis. 

nomics and economic theory and 
wanted his students to be prepared 
to discuss economics and deal with 
public policy: Groves said. "He was 
very concerned that the students we 
put out on the job market were 
good economists." 

Richard Carson, who also 
worked with Heller, said that 
"(Heller) took an active role in work-
ing with assistant professers, making 
a concerted effort to raise the stan-
dard of teaching in the department." 

Heller was deeply concerned 
with his students' quality of educa-
tion and also had "a personal 
warmth and really cared about his 
students, which certainly came 
through in his teaching: Starr said. 

Heller's research was published 
frequently in leading academic 
journals and books. Topics of those 
included foundations of unemploy-
ment, stability of economic growth, 
demand for money and use of mar-
kets to distribute resources with the 
risk of failure due to incomplete-
ness or monopoly. Heller served on 
the Executive Committee of the 
American Economic Association 
and served as associate editor for 
the Joumal of Economic Theory. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Tuition: 
Court's ruling refuted 
previous legislation 
ecw ........ ,... ... 3 
Califomia welfare payments. This 
refuted previous legislation, which 
had stated that a new California res-
ident would receive the lower of the 
two payments between what is 
offered by California and the per-
son's previous state of residence. 

Markowitz said the case against 
the UC system will probably com-
mence early this summer and will 
have to be settled at a later date. 

In 1964, Heller received his 
bachelor's degree in mathematics at 
the University of Minnesota, where 
J.,enoid Hurwiez, eminent econo-
mist and winner of the U.S. National 
Medal of Science, was his professor. 

Heller received his doctorate in 
1970 from Stanford University, 
where he received dissertation 
guidance from Nobel Prize recipi-
ent Kenneth]. Arrow. 

Starr shared an office with 
Heller at Stanford during his grad-
uate years and emphasized the 
impact that studying under Arrow, 
along with UC Berkeley Nobel 
Prize winner Gerard Debreu, had 
on himself and Heller as students of 
economic theory. 

Heller is survived by his wife 
Diemut, his son Nicholas, who is a 
sophomore at UCSD, and his 
daughter Marika. who is a student 
at Frances Parker School. Heller's 
brother Eric resides in Cambridge, 
Mass., and his sister Karen Davis 
lives in Seattle. 

A private memorial service is 
planned. Heller's family asks that 
donations be made to the Walter P. 
Heller Memorial Fund in place of 
flowers.

Scholar warrior: Master Shannon Kawika Phelps sits in 'seiza' position. The Temple of the Full Autumn Moons logo of the Tengu mask and Yin Yang sign rests behind an ancient ceremonial gong. 

C R 0 5 5 I N G F I V E M 0 U N T A I N-S 
PAR T 2 o F 2 

Modern scholar warrior defines the martial arts 
han non Kawika Phelps is a rare 
teacher who offers rarer arts. A martial 
artist, he has walked both the persim-
mon path and the thin red line. He 
has also traversed the world from the 
Northern territories of China to the 
ivy walls of Harvard. He was a soldier 
in Vietnam, an officer in Syria, a schol-

ar at Stanford, a tourist in Hong Kong and a 
stranger in the United States. 

But he was always a martial artist in form 
and practice. 

What Master Phelps divulges 
to his advanced students are not 
only the ancient dances of his 
martial traditions, but their his-
tory and relevance. Therefore, 
the Daruma dance is taught in 
accordance with a short course 
in Buddhist cosmology and the-
ology. You not only perform the 
dance, you know why the dance 
is performed. However, most martial arts 
schools rarely give a course in comparative 
religion between their crescent kicks. 

Master Phelps and his school, the Temple 
of the Full Autumn Moon, take a more tradi-
tional approach. Master Phelps' beginning 
students learn how to kneel "properly" for 
their first few weeks, while other institutions 
may have you kicking and punching by the 
first month . It is a humbling and authentic 
experience that weeds out faint-hearted stu-
dents. 

There is no modern definition for Master 
Phelps. This might be because he follows tra-

ditions thousands of years old. Modernity has 
overlooked these archaic lifestyles. However, 
one can travel back to the medieval courts of 
Zhou China and find the appropriate term of 
"wen wu xing," or, "scholar warrior." 

The scholar Ye3rrior defined himself 
through his actions, developed a wide variety 
of skills in both the arts and sciences. He was 
poet and boxer, doctor and swordsman, 
musician and knight. Master Phelps has 
played all of these roles in the span of his life, 

making him the 
closest modern 
prototype of the 
scholar warrior, 
one who practices 
as well as teaches. 

The following is 
an interview with 
Master Phelps on 
defining the mar-
tial arts as well as 

the techniques for teaching such esoteric art 
forms. 

How would ,... ............ .....tIIII .u

When you say the martial arts, it's like say-
ing, 'What kind of automobile are you dri-
ving?' General Motors? Well, it could be any-
thing from a little Chevette, to a GMC truck 
to a Cadillac or a Chevy. 

So it's very difficult to pin that down. It's 
too wide a term and there have been too 
many angles allowed to diversify in this com-
munity. And when I say 'community,' I mean

the Western community, American commu-
nity. So you can't answer that question direct-
ly because there are too many spokes, you 
see. 

The martial arts as they were originally 
taught in medieval China and Japan, they had 
one purpose - the ultimate concerns of the 
human endeavor: life and death. 

That's all it was, whether it be peasants 
defending their village or it be samurai 
defending their country or nationhood. 

Whether they were defending or 
invading, it was life and death. 
That's what the martial arts 
meant, originally. That original 
battlefield art was very specific; it 
had a very parochial purpose. 

But human endeavor never 
allows anything to only have one 
purpose, ultimately, so it evolves. 
And the different elements of 
the human psyche were able to 

take that life-and-death sequence that the. 
battlefield arts represented and transform 
them into different values. 

They began to see the essence of the psy-
che from such delineations. It could be reli-
gious or leadership qualities. It could be filial 
piety or it could be maintaining the discipline 
of the village or community by using hierar-
chy and the respect for elders, the discipline 
the arts required. It could have been related, 
ultimately, as you see now, in the more mod-
em period where we have a stable and more

Biospheria Tour 
Reorganizes Reality 
Environmental opera reflects utopian themes 
of introspection and isolation 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

There are times when you watch a per-
formance and you find yourself in complete 
awe of the entire production. Other times 
you feel like you missed the entire point of 
the performance - Biospheria falls some-
where in between. 
. Biospheria is billed as "an environmental 

opera," but don 't let the word "opera" sway 
your initial impression. It is nowhere near 
an opera in the classical sense of the word. 
The producers of the show, Steven Ausbury 
and Anthony Burr, worked for over a year 
on Biospheria before it made its debut on 
the UCSD campus early in March. 

There are obvious references to Bios-
pher~ 2.in Arizona, which was a project that 

isolated a team of scientists in the world 's 
largest enclosed ecosystem. Biosphere 2 was 
intended to be the prototype for a colony on 
Mars and was also supposed to explore dif-
fe rent holistic theories of ecology. It was 
subsequently discovered, however, that the 
founders of Biosphere 2 were not exactly 
"real" scientists. In fact, the founders were 
actually part of a theater company with 
alleged cult-like tendencies . 

Biospheria reflects the utopian themes 
that Biosphere 2 attempted to create and the 
isolation that it ultimately created. The 
entire production blurs the lines between 
art and science. What makes the production 
fascinating is that the entire audience is lit-
erally involved every step of the way.

12 HIATUS 

Club Fais Do Do Delivers 
One of the best 18-over clubs around 
By HEATHER CLARK 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

In light of the usual images of 
young promiscuous teenybop-
pers, it seems as if there is a short-
age of good or at least halfway 
decent underage clubs in South-
ern California. 

Even though The Epicenter in 
Mira Mesa deserves an honorable 
mention with its devotion to 
youth in the punk and ska scene, 
there are few options in our 
measly backyard. Otherwise, most 
people are heading to Los Ange-
les. 

Los Angeles has a variety of 
big underage clubs, although its 
two most popular clubs, The 
Playground and The Arena, are 
little more than TJ-style sex-on-
a-dance-floor. The real problem 
is finding something a little more 
mature and a little closer to the 
atmosphere of the finer 21-and-
over ven ues. 

If this is what you're looking 
for, then you have to check out 
club Fais Do Do. 

Since its opening last year, Fais 
Do Do has quickly become one 
of the best 18-and-over clubs 
around . With a variety of live 

bands and DJs, the music ranges 
from Latin Salsa to alternative 
rock. 

While the music varies, the 
atmosphere stays a steady cool. 
The crowd is at ease and free to 
mingle with the laid-back musi-
cians. In a creative and artistic 
environment, there is a lot of 
space to dance, watch and mingle 
with the many quirky personali-
ties. 

Among the latest trends is 
Rodney Bingenheimer from the 
world famous KROQ hosting 
"Rodney's English Disco." The 
disco, which is meant to "get peo-
ple out to dance to different kinds 
of music." certainly does just that. 

The event, which is held on 
the fourth Friday of every month, 
allows the in-the-know youth to 
come and rub elbows with Bin-
genheimer. Members of 
"Blondie" and "Hole" have been 
known to make appearances and 
roam among the crowd. 

Observing the outfits, person-
alities, and the likes of Bingen-
heimer hitting on 18-year-old 
girls can bring plenty of amuse-
ment.

'civilized' environment. 

Since the battlefield essences 
were not nearly as prevalent or as 
powerful as history progressed into 
more peaceful times, the human 
psyche continued to evolve around 
the individual, rather than the com-
munity. 

In those days. it wasn't about the 
individual. It was about defending 
the village or collective. It was about 
the larger unit where you were just 
one cog in it. 

Well, as the individual became 
more important, this is what the 
psyche extracted from those !TIartial 
arts: an emphasis on health, medita-
tion, spirituality, form, sport, perfor-
mance. All of those things are the 
modern fruits of what the battlefield 
masters were dealing with : self-
defense. 

For instance, when someone 
comes into my school and they ask 
me what they can learn here, I ask 
what they want to learn. They reply, 
'I want to learn self-defense.' Well, 
my first question is, 'What self do 
you wish to defend?' 

You see, the onus is on the stu-
dent to learn. When I teach, I teach 
as' if it were rain passing over an area 
of the geography. The rain is the 

same, but some of the little bushes 
take what it needs to nurture them-
selves, some of the larger bushes and 
trees take what they need to nurture 
themselves. But the rain doesn't give 
a little here and a little there. It rains. 

So the way I look at martial al1$, 
I teach it the way it was originally 
taught: I teach the way it was taught 
200 years ago for the battlefield. I'm 
interested in those life-and-death 
sequences. I consider it such a 
multi-dimensional idea, which is the 
reason I teach it the way it was 
taught then. 

Now, I realize some people are 
going to be more interested in one 
area while others will want to con-
centrate on others. That's why I call 
my training Wu Shan Fa, Five 
Mountain Method. Or in Japanese, 
Go Zan Ryu. And what that means 
is that I wish my students to climb 
five mountains. 

I wish them to climb the first 
mountain which is the physical, 
learning how to close their openings 
on the physical level using the mar-
tial disciplines. the movements of 
martial forms. 

But also, I want them to climb 
the next mountain, the sensual 
mountain, [wllich isl acknowledging 
the five senses, learning to become 
more aware of the environment 
around them. 

Then the mental level, strategy. 
Always learning to think ahead, 
constantly in as state of chess or go. 

Then there's the emotional level:

my values and desires and how Huc-
tuating I become in terms of rising 
high or sinking low to depression. It 
is the mountain where you learn 
how to balance your emotions so 
they don't give you away or, more 
importantly, don't lead you into an 
area where you embarrass or hurt 
someone else. 

And then the ultimate level, the 
fifth mountain, the spiritual moun-
tain. What is that? Well, it encom-
passes all the others. How so might 
be a little different for each student, 
so I try to rain the same on all five of 
the mountains. 

The physical level usually means 
tht! most for my beginning students. 
Physical self-defense. I say, good. 
The principles of physical self-
defense are basically learning the 
same principles in all the other 
models, but they have ungible evi-
dence of their succesS! Somebody 
comes at them, they defend against 
that. But 'that' can be a metaphor. 

That person attacking you can be 
a Twinkie sitting on the counter -
that's attacking you too, sometimes 
on a deeper level. It can be a 
metaphor for anything attacking 
you, whatever it is that is enticing 
you, intimidating you, threatening 
you. And it's learning to have com-
posure under pressure to learn how 
to Heal with these obstacles. Within 
all of my martial arts training. the 
forms and movemel'!ts were taught

ContInued from ..... 11 

Dressed in plastic ponchos and 
armed with headphones, audience 
members are taken around the 
UCSD campus to sites that repre-
sent some of the historical 
moments of Biosphere 2. Groups 
of eight are plugged into the CD 
player of a group leader, and the 
listeners' ears are filled with syn-
thesized noises from nature: The 
computer-generated sounds incor-
porate the sounds of birds, frogs 
and water. 

"The idea was to create a simu-
lated nature," Burr said, "and there 
are also little details according to 
each environment: . 

So imagine yourself in a plastic 
poncho, wires from your head-
phones connected to your field 
leader, wandering around campus 
and watching Biospherians dressed 
in a cult-like shade of white acting 
out the different scenes. At first it's 
difficult to digest, but it eVolves 
into a surreal experience. 

The discomfort brought by 
being confined with other people is 
especially noticeable in a particular 
scene in which the audience is 
seated' around a massive dining 
table for the Biospherians. The 
noise playing in the background 
softens to nothing and, for what 
seems like' an etern ity, the entire 
audience remains quiet - unsure 
of whether it should talk. 

Biospheria is . the "subjective 
experience of being contained and 
linked to other people," Burr said. 
"The story itself raises interesting 
questions about utopian ideas." 

The cult-like tendencies of 
those in Biosphere 2 is reflected in 
Biospheria. The_ a_ctors' white 
clothes present a disconcerting 
image of utopia - or is it confor-
mity? The audience is even led by a 
shepherd through all the scenes. 

Throughout the performance, 
the operatic aspect of Biospheria is 
transmitted through the head-
phones, as the noises are often the 
background music to the Biosphe-
rians ' reading of fictional diary 
en tries, wh ich reflect the frustra-
tion of being confi ned in an

Otherwise, I wouldn't have my own

that, but on the other hand I've seen 
these young people smile and 
become better citizens because of 
that. Other people teach it for per-
formance and for the beauty in the 
art. I give them credit for that, even 
though that has limitations as well. 
Tai Chi Chuan is a good example. 

Tai Chi Chuan is the queen of all 
the martial arts, also the most ruth-
less if people really understood the 
history and tradition of that art. 
There's a reason why those Tai Chi 
masters are so famous. It's because

But what we see today are the 
gentle movements. And what the 
masters also extracted from that art

but the art of proper health. The art 
f proper breathing and body move-

ment, biomechanics. Other people 
saw value in the art of meditation, 
meditation ;n motion. All of those 
are true of Tai Chi: combat, health, 
meditation. 

Some people emphasize one, 
some emphasize others. Are they 
wrong? No. My own personal feel-
ing is that when you emphasize one 
thing too much, it no longer 
becomes Tai Chi. It's something else 
they've derived from Tai Chi. But it 
requires all' three of the elements for 
the art to truly manifest. 

Not everybody agrees with me, 
but that's where I'm coming from. I 
teach Tai Chi for combat whereas 
most others do not They assume to 
teach karate or boxing because Tai 
Chi is too complex. I cannot do that 
because I feel as if' would be dilut-
ing the art. But, that doesn't mean 
I'm not concerned with the medita-
tion or the performance. So I try to 
teach on all three levels. Not every-
one is happy with that.

The Mexican 

Ok, it's got some big names, 
such as Julia Roberts and Brad 
Pitt, but is "The Mexican" really 
any good? 

Surprisingly, yes. With some 
good acting and a spicy mix of 
mobsters, romance and Mexican 
folklore , "The Mexican" pulls 
together to make for a worthwhile 
flick. 

The hard-headed bagman Jerry 
(Pitt) is forced to retrieve a price-
less gun from Mexico while his 
overemotional girlfriend Saman-
tha (Roberts) leaves him and runs 
off to Las Vegas. Jerry heads to 
Mexico and Samantha gets kid-
napped . Throw in some twists and 
turns, and you have your movie. 

As the story unfolds, the histo-
ry behind the cursed gun is told in 
a corny but strangely powerful tale 
in black-and-white scenes. 
Samantha dodges death and 
engages in deep psychobabble 
with her gay kidnapper, while Jerry 
stumbles through his problems 
like a modern-day Forrest Gump. 

The film ignores all genre lines 
and keeps the audience members 
on the edge of their seats in a story 
you can't quite pin down. ~e 
interaction between such drastl-

. cally different characters seem 
unlikely, but stellar performances 
by Pitt and Roberts create a chem-
istry that makes the relationship 
believable. 

The movie is like a compilation 
of different worlds fighting for 
control of the plot as the story 
seems to support one view of the 
world and then the other. From 
mobster murders to killers in love, 
you are always wondering what the 
real point is, what is going to hap-
pen next and what world to believe 
in. Tied together with the theme of 
love, this movie occasionally bor-
ders on cheesy but ends up being 
original and amusing.

Two Eastern Europeans have

and utilize America's forgiving 
heart to escape the consequences. 
After all, if America can swallow 
the trash on talk shows, why not 
forgive killers?

of De Niro's character - includ-
ing a mention of alcoholism that 
disappears like the La Jolla sun-
shine - and even less develop-
ment of Burns' character. Appar-
ently his character dreamt of 
fighting fires as a kid. Now you 
know as much as me. 

What this means is that by the 
end, you might not care who dies, 
who lives, or what grand message 
it is you're supposed to have got-
ten. 

Kudos to the two villains, Emil 
(Karel Roden) and Oleg (Oleg 
Taktarov) for playing killers who 
seem to be getting better at being 
bad as the movie progresses .. They 
look like they have fun but it's 
hard to tell if that should be 
thought of as frightening or 
absurd. 

Herzfeld 's movie tries to point 
a critical eye at America, and in 
this he succeeds. However, the 
lack of suspense and involvement 
wi ll leave you apathetic.

Common ground found 
in the martial arts 

about developing an attitude. It was 
a much more esoteric art. 

So what I had to do with all of 
these styles was find a common 
denominator. What is the common 
denominator? Each of these arts 
were born, bred and nurtured on 
the battlefield. None of them is 
from a studio or training camp off 
to the side. None of them, in any 
shape or form, is done for its own 
sake where teachers handed down 
certificates to students to make 
some money. 

These arts: master Fu Zhen 
Song, the Saito clan, the art of Lua, 
the Dai Lao Gung Fu - all of them 
had that one thing in common. 
They were nurtured in the battle-
field. What is the battlefield made 
up of? Human beings. And there is 
only so much human beings can 
do with only two arms, two legs 
and one head. Its amazing how 
much we can do, but nevertheless, 
it does limit us as opposed to three 
arms or four legs. 

The battlefield is where men's 
lives are at stake. And I'm not talking 
about two guys dancing around and 
slap boxing. I'm talking about 
arrows flying and cavalry charging 
and the real world of men wanting 
to kill each other - only so much is 
going to work out there. And the 
principles that survived, survived 
because they worked. The ones that 
didn't were lost on the battlefield. 
You'd come home from the battle 
and you'd tell your sons and grand-
sons what were effective. 

Quite frankly, I think most of 
these other styles have a problem 
with that; they weren 't bred in the 
battlefield . They're much newer, 
they come from studios and civilized 
peaceful environments where they 
became diluted into sport and com-
petition, That's not wrong, Those 
are legitimate ways of using these 
arts. However, there's an older way 
and that's what I teach. 

My job is to teach principles; to 
make myself unnecessary as my stu-
dents begin to catch on. The Fu 
family and the Ba Gua arts are very 
similar in principle to the Saito Nin-
jitsu because they were formed out 
of the same combat environment. It 
doesn 't matter if was 'China or the 
Middle East or Japan or Medieval 
Jerusalem with the Knights of Tem-
plar. Basically, it was the same prin-
ciple involved - survival against 
hordes of others just like me fight-
ing and advancing, 

So, I see the movements in the 
Fu family and I see how Saito Nin-
jitsu, the stylings, fit into each 
other. Although their interpreta-
tions of combat are unique, similar 
principles can be found with each 
tradition . 

So when [ teach Saito Ninjitsu, 
my students know what they're get-
ting and when they learn the Fu 
style Ba Gua, they know it's just Ba 
Gua. However, when it comes to the 
applications, and [ start showing 
how to break these down and make 
them functional, then [ teach them 
how the two are informing each 
other. So the two arts - rather, all 
the arts within the Wu Shan Fa -
are informing each othe~ constantly.

The Places 
"The Autopilot Knows You Best" 

Absolutely Kosher Records 
A 

Getting away from the generic 
recipe for famous bands, which rely 
on bar chords, loud singing and cute 
asses, The' Places, with their debut 
album "The Autopilot Knows You 
Best," come up with a fresh new 
sound that is bound for sllccess. 
Although largely unk'nown, this 
underground band is quickly gaining 
popularity as its undeniable talent 
spreads through the college airwaves. 

From Portland, Ore., the group 
is comprised of young singer Amy 
Annelle and her friends, who 
together give an urban twist to the 
old folk melody. With a mix of low-
fi and electronic sampling, the 
intricate [ayers of music hold your 
attention while the product 
remains calming and smooth. 

The fo[k melody and lyrics are 
reminiscent of the type of songs 
your parents would have written in 
their hippie days. But the new edge, 
driven by electric guitars and the 
emotional voice of Annelle, let the 
youthfu[ sound of these urban kids 
come through. 

Probably the best underground 
album this year, "The Autopilot 
Knows You Best" offers a perfet1 set 
of tunes to which you can cudd[e up, 
watch the rain and re[ax in a tantric 
escape from suburban coDege life. 

Get this a[bum and keep your 
ears open for more from this up-
and-.coming band.

ground - he knows this because 
he's human. The priest understands 
this because he understands human 
behavior to a high degree. 

He must understand human 
behavior because he must under-
stand his own. To become a priest, 
you must purify yourself of your 
own 'behaviors: So, 'the priest 
already understands this about you 
because he's already reflected upon 
himself. He sees your weakness and 
he can use it to either take your life 
or· save your life. 

So the Hula master is also a heal-
er as well as a teacher. The Hawaiian 
Lua art is about receiving energy, 
grace, and to use that grace to main-
tain dignity and propriety in the 
environment. 

A person like that is hard to beat 
because he has God behind him 
like the Muja-Hadeen of 
Afghanistan. The Koran has told 
them they have the support of 
Allah. The Shaolin priest is also 
dangerous because he believes that 
all his actions are meant to support 
harmony. He is not a warrior, but a 
healer. 

This is what the Lua master is 
about: grace. And [ tell you, if you've 
ever been hit by a Lua master, you 
feel the grace.

rare not becau~ people haven 't said 
something like this, but because 
they turn into some cute aphorism 
and go on to be less than what they 
preach. . 

So, right now is not a good time. 
The arts are responding to the low-
est levels of our human conscience 
right now. And that's not good. But [ 
believe good things come out of bad. 
It's just not a circle of good and bad. 
[ts more like a spiral of evolution. 

[ preserve the optimism that my 
kind of teaChing, my kind of tradi-
tional art, will come back and grab 
hold of them. [f ~ gave up on that, it 
wouldn't be there for them. But 
right now, that's not what they're 
seeking; they're still seeking the 
fruit. 

There are two different attitudes 
in martial arts today that I look at. 
One is the 'look at me' attitude -
the trophies and belts and maga-
zines and celebrity. I'm still teaching 
the 'awareness all around me' atti-
tude -a very different way of think-
ing. 

And when [judge a school, and [ 
do, I'm as prejudiced as a ll of the 
other egotistical guys out there who 
do this stuff. [ say, 'Is he teaching 
ulook-at-me" or uawareness-a ll -
around"?' 

That I have a concern for. Right 
now we're losing that battle. But that 
will ultimately change, but not for 
the whole world. [ can't fix the 
whole world. But, I'll be there when 
somebody needs it. Plus, my stu-

dents are learning so there might be

There's always one more to carry 
on. 

Every sword [ teach is double-
edged, The Tengu sword is double-
edged. [t can either be used to take 
a life or save a life. Martial arts is 
like this. It can either undermine 
the best qualities we have to offer as 
humans or underline those quali-
ties. 

[f the teacher is underlining such 
qualities, [ have no problem with the 
art he's teaching. [f he's undermin-

ing them [sighl, [ sometimes get 
upset. How do [ measure that? I can 
only measure it through my own 
prism. And I may be wrong. 

So [ have to hold even those 
ideas up to scrutiny as well as levity. 
[f [ do that, tllen all my teachers and

dependent on how you get to the

high 10 digs. Jordan Hove recorded 
37 assists in the effort. 

Loyola improved its record to 
11 -3 with the victory. 

The Tritons faced off against 
Cal State Northridge on Saturday 
in an attempt to break out of the 
goose egg that has dominated their 
win column all season long. They 
came pumped up and ready to play. 
which was a good thing, as the final 
point would not be scored until 
some two hours and 25 minutes 
later. A full five sets were pl.ayed 
that night, with the lead going back 
and forth at the end of each. 

The Matadors won the first set 
by a 30-27 score and the Tritons 
took the second. 35-30. The third 
set was an all-out battle royale. 
going all the way to extra points 
before the Tritons blinked and 
Northridge had its second victory. 
33-31 . The Tritons were not ready 
to roll over just yet. however. and 
rebounded for the fourth set win, 
30-26. to send it to the fifth and 
deciding set. The final set was a 
heartbreaker for the Tritons. as they 
.were barely topped by a 15-13 final 
score that gave the night's MPSF 
victory to the Matadors. 

The Matadors relied heavily on 
their duo of foreign ringers. Eckhard 
Walter, a 6-foot-l0-inch behemoth 
from Germany. and Oz Ozkaya. a 6-
foot-3-inch outside hitter from 
noted volleyball juggernaut nation 
Thrkey, were impressive on the floor. 
Walter punished the Tritons with 24 
kills and nine digs, while Ozkaya 
used his Turkish gold to deliver 17 
kills and nine digs. Joe Nargi. who 
had 11 kills. and Raoul Williams. 
who had 10. were also factors for

The Tri tons also had some 
impressive individual efforts to go 
along with a solid team showing.

Cogorno also raised a few eyebrows 
with his 13 kills, while Eric Perrine

Track 
Comes 
Close 
Ewanio leads the 
way for UCSD with 
three firsts 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and women's 
track and field team competed in a 
tri-meet against UC Irvine lind 
cross-town rival San Diego State 
University at SDSU's campus last 
weekend. 

With the men and women both 
falling short on the scoreboard, the 
Tritons have seen better days. 

The Aztec women finished with 
131 points for first place, followed 
by the Anteaters, who finished sec-
ond with ]03 points. UCSD fin-
ished third with 97 points. 

On the men's side of the action, 
Irvine came in first with 105 points. 
The Tritons finished with 9] 
points. SDSU did not enter a men's 
team. 

The only highlight for the Tri-
ton women was Juliana Mittino. 
She recorded a NCAA Division 11-
qualifying performance in the pole 
vault with a leap of] 0 feet, 11-3/4 
inches. 

The men faced a competitor 
with a good performance record all 
season. 

Rob Ewanio was unstoppable as 
usual for UCSD, finishing first in 
three throwing events. He took 
with the shotput a toss of 48 feet, 
9-]/2 inches, the discus throw with 
a toss of 133 feet, 11 inches, and 
the hammer throw with a launch of 
157 feet, 1 inch. 

Triton star James relson ran 
the 50DO-meter run two weeks ago 
in ]4:28.18, an NCAA-qualifying 
time. 

Next up for UCSD is another 
trip across town, when it heads to 
the San Diego State Invitational on 
March 24. 

Softball: 
Tritons come close in 
second game, losing 4-3 
ContI.ed from ..... 20 

before UCSD was able to get the 
third out in the top of the sixth. 

The score remained 4-3 in favor 
of Northern Iowa for the rest of the 
game. 

UCSD assistant coach Becky 
Newbry felt that it was the Tritons 
who beat themselves in the second 
game . 

"I thought we played well ." 
Newbry said. "I felt that our team 
was strong enough to take both 
games, but we fell short. We made a 
few mistakes that cost us, but I 
think we're learning from them and 
we're getting better." 

UCSD, with an overall record of 
12-8 and 8-6 in CCAA, returns to 
conference competition Friday at 
noon at CSU Stanislaus, which is 
sitting atop the CCAA standings. 
Following Frid~'s . doubleheader, 
the Tritons will play in three con-
secutive doubleheaders on the 
road. 

"It's always tough to play on 
the road," Newbry said. "We knew 
this next month was going to be 
all on the road. We just have to 
play our game and do what we can 
do and hope that the best turns 
out on our side. If not, we'll come 
back and hit the drawing board 
again and go after it the next 
time." 

After the long string of road 
games, the Tritons will return 
home to play a nonconference 
doubleheader against cross-town 
rival University of San Diego on 
April 4.

"My dad was a pretty successful

Indoor player for a long time so I

able to think that way now." 

In many instances ' a player

"Because of my 
beach background 
where you have to

everything well -
hitting, passing, 
defense, setting, 
etc. - I had 
to develop my all-
around skills a lit-

th1\t I cou Id proba-

tionJ, I knew that I would get a

competition in the country: 

According to Have, collegiate-
level volleyball in a Division II and 
high school play is like night and 
day. 

"I think just like anything else' tn 
college, this is the biggest differ-
ence between college and high 
school: The level of competition is 
so much higher: he said. "Instead 
of going up against 6-foot-2 guys 
who have marginal skills, we play

Daly in golf can hit huge drives, 
and that is pretty much what 
makes him a really good player. I 
don't have that one thing, so I try 
to be good at everything in order 
to be a good player." 

This fonnula has him leading 
the team in sets and serves. Hove's 
play has allowed the Tritons to be 
competitive in every match, regard-
less of the level of competition and 
regardless of their current record. 

As for those on the team who 
have helped with the transition to 
the collegiate level, Hove gives 
credit to junior Kevin Flynn 
and senior Ernie Yun, who accord-
ing to Have, have "helped me to 
understand what kind of a unique 
situation I have here at UCSD."

Get Ready 
For Some 
Madness 

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

T his is such a wonderful time of year in the sports world. I mean, there arc plenty of 
great times for sports people like 
myself, but this month is one of 
those top two or three occasions. 

While the sweet contest of bast:-
ball gets prepared to start its gruel-
ing season, football is in the throes 
of its offseason, and the NBA is wal-
lowi ng in the part of the season that 
no one really cares about (i .e. not the 
playoffs), college basketball now has 
center stage. And boy do they know 
how to put on a show. 

What I am talking about, of 
course, is March M"dness, other-
wise known as tht: CAA Tourna-
ment. 

For two weeks, culminating 
April 2, 65 teams will battle for the 
top spot in the nation. Right now, 
all schools have a shot, from 
Michigan State to Creighton, from 
Illinois to Cal State orthridge 
(Yes, they are in it!). 

Actually, not all the teams have 
a chance. There are two schools 
that will certainly make the final 
four, and they are Stanford and 
Duke. The teams in their brackets 
are pretty much out of luck . 

The third will probably be 
North Carolina out of the Midwest 
bracket, though don't count out 
Michigan State or Florida. 

The fourth team, and the school 
I think will win it all, will be Arizona. 
Their seven losses and their second 
seed because of these arc a mirage. 
They went through some serious 
trouble this season, stemming from 
some serious distractions. 

Illinois, the top seed in the Mid-
west, I believe is slightly overrated. 
They are good, but not as good as 
Arizona. 

Arizona will beat Duke in the 
final. Does this have anything to 
do with the influence of both of my 
parents, who are proud Wildcats? 
Nah, not at all. (Are you happy 
now, Mom and Dad?) 

My sleeper of the tournament is 
Hofstra. I think that this 13th 
ranked school will down UCLA in 
the first round and will make it to 
the Sweet 16. Why? How about an 
18-game winning streak and four 
seniors starting. 

These predictions, if true, can 
really help my pocketbook. 

Yes, there is a little bracket pool 
happening that I got myself into. Is 
it for money? No officer, of course 
not, not at all, wink, wink. 

I dream sometimes of having a 
Division I basketball team at 
UCSD. Then we could all gather 
and cheer on our Tritons in the 

CAA tournament. We could 
place our bets and look for our 
guys to bring home the trophy. We 
could watch Hungry Moses hang-
ing out with the Stanford tree, 
showing what a real mascot is. 

UCSD does have its own mad-
ness, and that is the dominance of 
certain squads on campus such as 
the men's water polo team and the 
women's soccer team. In fact, I 
would not exchange them for any 
Division I team. 

As for March Madness, let's get 
ready for two weeks of upsets and 
showdowns. It's time for some fun .

Volleyball 
Gets 
Swept 
Tritons fall to Loyola, 
lose heartbreaker to 
CSUN 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD men 's volleyball was 
thwarted last week, in its search for 
an elusive tirst win in Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation play. 
First, its opponents used an obvi-
ous height advantage to do in 
UCSD, and then a pair of foreign 
imports had lhe Tritons' number. 
Both games ended in losses for the 
boys in blue and gold. 

Wednesday of last week, the Tri-
tons held court at RIMAC Arena in 
a nonconference match with the 
Ramblers of Loyola University of 
Chicago. The Ramblers used their 
taller players - they suited up four 
athletes who were 6 feet, 8 inches 
or taller, compared to the Tritons' 
tallest, at 6 feet, 6 inches - to shut 
down the Tritons' attack and 
emerge with a game sweep by 
scores of 30-28,30-24 and 31-29. 
Despite the obvious disadvantage, 
the Tritons overcame their short-
comings to keep each set close, 
even sending the final set into extra 
points before the Ramblers shut 
the door. 

Loyola was led by the impres-
sive tag team efforts of Brad Stoub 
and Rick Sullivan, who each had 11 
kills on the night. Dan Hass, one of 
the team's long drinks of water, at 6 
feet,8 inches, also was a main con-
tributor for the Ramblers with 5 
kills and a match-high 10 blocks. 
Setter Shane Davis was the chef 
behind the marvelous meal being 
served up by Loyola, dishing out 44 
assists. 

Senior Zach Hite was the man 
on the floor for UCSD, knocking 
down 13 kills and adding " digs. 
Fellow Triton Eric Perrine punched 
through 11 kills, while Eric Rowe

Great athletes are the ones 
opposing coaches worry about. 
Great athletes pose problems for 
the defense. Great athletes will 
cause a coach to yell, "Put a body 
on him!" or UDon't let him get a 
clear shotl" 

Junior Jordan Hove has become 
that player for the UCSD men's 
volleyball team. 

Hove began playing volleyball at 
the age of 10, which means he has 
spent a full 10 years in the sport.
