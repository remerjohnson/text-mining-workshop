UCSD Women Take Back the 
Night in Weeklong Campaign 
Tanya Brown, sister of Nicole Brawn Simpson, spoke about 
domestic violence at Price Center raIry Thursday night 

Sfllff Wrtt.,. 

Tanya Brown, the sister of Nicole Brown 
Simpson, spoke at UCSD's second Take Baclt 
the Night rally and march last Thursday. 

Sponsored by the A.S. Council and the 
Women's Center, the event was pan of a wcclt-
long campaign to raise awareness about scxuaJ 
usault, and to give people a chance to speak 
out about violence against women. 

Brown, who was a student at CSU San 
Marcos at the time of her sister's murder, spoke 
about ways for women to protect themselves 
against potential offenders. Brown in member 
of the Nicole Brown Charitable Foundation's 
Legislative Committee and helped create legis-
lation benefiting victims, mostly women and 
children, from abusive situations. 

~ [ don't think people really understand the 
importance of support when you are a victim of 

domestic violence," Brown said at the rally. 
"11tese women need to hear their peers tell 
them that it's not their fault It is vital that these 
women receive support from their peers" 

Brown also spOke about the laclt of emer-
gency shelters for women and children. 

"It is a moral disgrace that we have twice the 
number of animal shelters in this country than 
emergency shelters for women and children; 
Brown said. 

Emelyn de Ia Pti\a, one of the coordinators 
of Take Baclt the Night, said that one in tvery 
four women will be sexually assaulted in her 
lifetime and 28 percent of women live in abu-
sive homes. 

"Sexual assault was the only crime that did 
not decrease in San Diego County last year," de

Dynes Unveils 
NewUCSD 
Cancer Facility 
Center will be named after 
John and Rebecca Moores, 
who dtmated $20 million 
Iy VINCENT GRAMANI 
News Editor 

Chancellor Robert Dynes announced 
last Thursday that UCSD has secured $47 
million in private funding to build a new 
cancer facility dedicated to research, patient 
care and community service. 

John Moores, majority owner of the San 
Diego Padres and a UC regent, and his wife 
Rebecca donated $20 million to the new cen-
ter. Pending approval from the UC Regents. 
the new facility will be named the John and 
Rebecca Moores UCSD Cancer Center . 

While the Moores were unable to attend 
ll1Ursday's announcement, John Moores 
released a statement last week. 

·We believe that the superb, comprehen-
sive cancer program at UCSD is poised to 
join the ranks of the nation's premier cancer 
centers, improving access to the best avai l-
able cancer care through leadership and 
partnership: he stated. "We are exci ted to 
be a part of the university's vision for a 
world-class cancer program, which we 
believe will accelerate the pace of discovery 
and bring visibility and resources to our 
region as a recognized leader in the battle 
against cancer." 

Dynes praised the Moores for their gift. 
~this landmark donation is one of the 

largest gifts we have ever received at UCSD,w 
Dynes said. 

The John and Rebecca Moores Cancer 
Center facility is planned for a site on the 
east side of campus near Thornton 
Hospital. Dynes said he expects the univer-
sity to break ground for the project in one 
year and open the center in three years. 

The UCSD Cancer Center has been in 
existence since 1979 as a broad collabora-
tion among physicians and basic and clini-
cal researchers. It is one of 59 centers in the 
United . States to hold a National Cancer 
Institute designation. According to David

Rally: 
Campaign originated in 
Germarry in 1973 

Iicizc the need for all of us to edu-
cate ourselves about violence and 
its effects on our society." 

Take Back the Night rallies have 
been held throughout the United 
States since 1978. 

According to the National Take 
Back the Night campaign, it origi-
nated in Germany in 1973 in 
response to a series of sexual 
assaults, rapes and murders. Today, 
marches are held ill numerous 
cities in the United States, Canada, 
Latin America, India and Europe. 

Since 1992, UCSD has held two 
Take Back the Night rallies, and 
those who organized this year's 
event said they hope that support 
for their cause increases in coming 
years. 

De la Pena said the theme of 
this year's campaign was "Open 
your eyes and educate yourself." 

She spoke positively about 
those who attended the rally. 

"Although there was a relatively 
small crowd present at the rally, it 
was a very energetic and enthusias-
tic crowd,' de la Pena said. "They 
showed a lot of spirit marching 
through the campus,' 

Other speakers included 
Director of the Family Violence 
and Sexual Assault Institute Robert 
Geffner and Deputy District 
Attorney Lisa Weinreb. 

According to Weinreb, 70 per-
cent of sexual assault cases include 
the abuse of alcohol or drugs. 
Weinreb urged audience members 
to report any crimes they might 
knowof. 

"It is imperative that you take 
this power away from the offend-
ers,' Weinreb said. "Report these 
crimes. and help the district attor-
ney's office help you: 

Before she ended her speech, 
Brown advised the audience to try 
to increase community awareness 
of sexual assault crimes. She 
appealed to fraternities and sorori-
ties on campus, as well as other 
student organizations, to spread 
the word about the dangers of 
these crimes. 

"Make it your problem,' Brown 
said. "This is not only a women's 
problem, a men's problem and a 
human problem, but it is a com-
munity problem as well." 

Cancer: 
Same donors wiU receive 
engraved plaques 

tee members started making phone 
calls last Monday night. 

"We're going through the data 
bases and calling everyone with 
senior standing,' Peavey said. "I am 
starting kind of a grass roots cam-
paign by handing out flyers on 
Library Walk and going to student 
organizations and asking for help." 

Donations can be mailed to the 
UCSD Foundation do Senior Class

ETCETERA 

BRIEFLY 

Cam·pus Receives $222,000 Grant 
The National Science Foundation awarded 

UCSD $220,000 over the next two years to fund 
40 scholarships for underrepresented and low· 
income undergraduates who are pursuing 
degrees in computer science, engineering or 
mathematiCS. 

Each scholarship provided through the NSF 
grant will total up to $2,500 annually for two 
years. 

UCSD is one of a select number of Institu-
tions nationwide approved to receive fundIng for 
Computer Science, Engineering and 
Mathematics Scholarships. the NSF announced 
recently. UCSO's grant became effective April 1, 
2000. 

The scholarships, whose funding is autho-
rized by the American Competitiveness and 
Workforce Improvement Act of 1998, are intend-
ed to Increase the number of low-income ethnic 
minorities, women and persons with disabilities 
graduating in the fields of science, math and 
technology. 

At UCSO, the scholarship program will be 
administered by the recently created CSEMS 
program established by the Division of Student 
Affairs' Academic Enrichment Programs, the 
Jacobs School of E~ineeri~, the mathematics 
department and the San Diego Supercomputer 
Center. 

The San Diego Supercomputer Center, the 
mathematics department and the Academic 
Enrichment Program will also play integral roles 
in the CSEMS program by engagirc students in 
internships, research experiences and mentorirc 
activities in data-intensive computirc and erci-
neering. 

To receive scholarships, participating stu-
dents must remain enrolled full time in a CSEMS 
major, maintain a GPA of at least 2.80 and par· 
ticipate in educational enrichment activities 
designed to encourage their involvement with 
faculty and peers through mentorirc and collab-
orative learning and research. 

Financial eligibility for the program is based 
on criteria from the U.S. Department of 
Education for Pell Grants, and for the Graduate 
Assistance in Areas of National Need Program. 

Statistics show that despite recent gains in 
the numbers of women and underrepresented 
minorities obtaining degrees at all levels of sci· 
ence and engineering, these groups continue to 

ERRATA 

be underrepresented in the science end efIIl-
neering graduate prOlrams and in the labor 
force. This is especially true among doctoral sci· 
entists and engineers in computer science, 
mathematics and engineering. 

The International Affairs Group will present a 
lecture Monday titled "Nuclear Weapons: 
Hiroshima and Its Legacies.' The lectlM'e will be 
held from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Pepper Canyon 
Lodge. 

Martin Sherwin, professor of history and 
director of the Nuclear Age History & Humanity 
Center at Tufts University, will speak at the lec-
ture. Sherwin is currently writing a bioCraphy of 
J. Robert Oppenheimer. 

He is also the author of "A World Destroyed: 
Hiroshima and the OrIgins of the Arms Race,' 
the runner-up for the 1976 Pulitzer Prize, and 
winner of the Stewart Bernath Prize awarded by 
the Society for Historians of American Foreign 
Relations. 

Sherwin will talk about the decision to use 
atomic bombs at the end of World W", II and the 
controversies that have been associated with 
that decision and his vIew of the consequences 
for the nuclear arms race that followed. He will 
also talk about the 1994-5 controversy aroood 
the exhibit of the Enola Gay - the 8-29 that 
dropped the first atomic bomb - at the NatIonal 
Air and Space Museum, for which he was on the 
advisory board. 

Refreshments will be served at the lectlM'e.

The office of the vice chancellor of student 
affairs is in charge of seeing that UCSD main-

mission is drafting and reviewing university 
policies and regulations that seek to dissuade 
undesirable activities. 

UCSD Policies and Procedures Applying to 
Student Activities forbids such anti-social 
conduct as academic dishonesty (colloquially 
know as "cheating') , stealing university prop-
erty, forging university documents, misusing 
computer equipment on campus, possessing, 
distributing or manufacturing alcohol on 
campus without proper authorization, pos-
sessing a firearm on campus and sexually 
harassing or attacking anyone. It also contains 
a fairly lengthy section detailing and prohibit-
ing the use of "fighting words." 

The office of student affairs has this to say 
abut fighting words in Policies and Procedures 
entry 22.14.10.21: '''Fighting words' are those 
personally abusive epithets which, when 
directly addressed to any ordinary person are, 
in the context used and as a matter of com-
mon knowledge, inherently likely to provoke a 
violent reaction whether or not they actually 
do so." 

Kind of catchy, isn't it? 
Entry 22.14.10.21 goes on to expressly 

prohibit the use of any -derogatory phrases 
that attack someone on the basis of gender, 
sexual orientation, ethnicity or religion. This is 
a quite reasonable provision; such slurs have 

no place in an institution of higher learning. 
which is supposed to promote an environ-
ment of understanding and open-minded 

'appreciation of people from different back-
grounds. 

The definition, however, does not stop 
there. It adds that ·'Fighting words' constitute 
'harassment' when the circumstances of their 
utterance create a hostile and intimidating 
environment which the student uttering them 
should reasonably know will interfere with the 
victim's ability to pursue effectively his or her 
education or otherwise to participate fully in 
campus or university programs and activities." 

This is a whole different level of discourse. 
It is, in fact, a blank check for our litigious 
society to wreak havoc. 

Under this definition, intramural softball 
players who yell "Hey batted ' to distract the 
batter on the opposing team are no longer 
engaging in "chatter: they are engaging in 
"harassment' -- they are knowingly interfer-
ing with the batter's ability to participate in a 
campus activity. 

Insensitive people who insist on engaging 
in cellular telephone conversations in Geisel 
Library during finals week are not just rude, 
they are violating UCSD policy by disturbing 
other students' education. 

The Koala - even when it manages not to 
offend any readers - is violating the adminis-
tration's policy by distracting students from 
their studies, thereby disrupting their learning 
process. If readers happen to be reading this 
arti~le in class instead of paying attention to 
their professors, they have every justification 
to head over to the Office of the General 

Counsel and fLle a complaint against myself 
and the Guardian. 

The administration - as usual - has 
taken a subject that should be a fairly straight-
forward principle governed by common sense 
and utterly ruined it by trying to elucidate it in 
strict legal terms. What should have been left 
up to the discretion of the counsels in individ-
ual cases has instead been warped into a glar-
ing loophole. 

The policy itself stipulates that students 
should "reasonably know' if the language they 
are using constitutes fighting words. Trying to 
extrapolate this loose definition has only led to 
a horribly convoluted clause that turns any-
one who is moderately inconvenienced or 
offended into a victim. . 

Our society too often relies on legal provi-
sions and regulations to try to enforce good 
behavior. This system assumes that legal 
action and eventual punishment are better 
solutions than trying to resolve differences 
with face-to-face dialogue. Racist and sexist 
epithets should not be !olerated on campus, 
but extending the same intolerance to an 
overly broad range of situations serves no 
one's best interest. 

The university should not resort to 
administrative punishment in order to force 
people to be decent individuals because they 
will only end up being resentful. A dialogue 
between the two parties, mediated by a coun-
sel who has the authority to intervene in 
cases where truly abusive language has been 
used, is a far better, less authoritarian 
approach .

California Desperately Needs Capable Teachers to Guide the State's Youth 
Editor: 
An 8-year-old boy completes his 

first five-paragraph essay. With a 
newly found sense of satisfaction, he 
calls it "I Dream.' 

A shy 12-year-old girl, with her 
teacher by her side, gathers the 
courage to read aloud the story she 
has written. Her classmates applaud 
as she blushes proudly. 

A high school freshman, who 
had never competed in sports 
before, tried out for the soccer team 
only because his teacher told him he 
could do it, then scores the winning 
goal in a crucial game. 

They may seem like small steps, 
but for our children, they are impor-
tant strides toward a successful 
future; strides often taken only 
because of the dedication and skills 
of California's public school teachers. 

However, California is facing a 
crisis: a critical shortage of teachers. 
In the next decade, our public 
schools will need more than 250,000 
new teachers to keep up with retire-
ments, increased enrollment and 
class size reduction. The shortage of 
qualified teachers could jeopardize 
the quality of our children's educa-
tion and their future. It is essential 
that we attract the best and brightest 
individuals to become teachers. 

Teaching offers personal rewards 

not found in other careers. The 
glowing face of a child when he or 
she finally understands a new con-
cept - or gets that first "A" on a test. 
Second only to a child's parents, 
teachers can have the greatest 
impact on a child's future. With the 
guidance of quality teachers, chil-
dren who are struggling to write, or 
who may be shy, or who lack confi-
dence will be able to reach their full 
potential, one small but critical step 
ata time. 

There is no substitute for a qual-
ity teacher working with our chil-
dren. Teachers encourage. Teachers 

~uid.e. Teachers mentor. Teachers 
inSpIre.

Editor: 
I suggest that Aran Sadja 

("College Should not Create 
Robots: May 4) try urban studies 
and planning, ethnic studies or soci-
ology as a major. Perhaps he will find 
these majors more interesting, with 
professors who encourage students 
to criticize their knowledge, opinions 
and ideas. Furthermore, these are 
majors that do not try to perpetuate 
the social machine; rather, they chal-
lenge this system. 

You can truly "unlearn" in col-
lege with these majors and not nec-
essarily lead the boring, monoto-
nous life described in Sadja's article. 

Good luck.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Seminar Reveals the Path to 
Doctoral Enlightenment 
UCSD offers a course called ~ Physician's Life,' which is supposed to 
prepare students for the trials and tribulations of obtaining a medical degree 
DlVYA RUNCHAL 
Colummst 

My mother has always encour-
aged me to do three things in life: 
Brush my teeth three times a day 
(especially after eating gummi 
bears), be nice to my sister (some-
thing even Mother Teresa would 
have found hard to do) and become 
a doctor. So far, I have accomplished 
the first and second, but number 
three has evaded me. 

Although I have always been fas-
cinated by a career in the medical 
field, I realize my prospects for 
becoming a physician are pretty 
slim. I have often harbored a para-
lyzing fear that, due to my lack of 
scientific genius, I will probably fail 
the MCAT and be denied admission 
to even the lowliest medical school. 

lot only will my life be in sham-
bles, but my pet rabbits Coco and 
Chanel will probably die of broken 
hearts. I have always promised them 
that once I become a famous physi-
cian and earn enough money for 
three first-class tickcts on the 
Concord, we will be able to sun our-
selves on the warm beaches of 
Tahiti. 

Then, one day at the end of last 
quarter, I had an epiphany. While 
searching for interesting classes in 
the UCSD spring catalog, I discov-
ered a class tailored to people like 
me, who like medicine but needed 
more knowlcdge about It. Here was 
the answer to my uncertainty about 
the future. The class called • A 
Physician's Life" is taught by Alan 
Maisel, a humorous and engaging 
professor who specializes 111 cardiol-

ogy. 
The first time I entered the class, 

my heart skipped a beat as I realized 
there were more students in the 
room than there were chairs. 
However, I was comforted by the 
notion that even though I was not 
officially enrolled in the class, I still 
had an excellent chance of being 
able to enroll late, since I had been 
able to do that in many other class-
es at UCSD. 

My train of thought, however, 
was interrupted by a gruff and 
impatient voice that asked (or 
rather, told) me to put my name on 
a piece of paper to be submined into 
a lonery. 

A lortery? My teacher is a 
grump? What is the quickest way 
out of here? These questions per-
vaded my mind as the lucky winners 
were announced. JUSt when hope 
was beginning to fade for me, I final-
ly heard my name. An enormous 
sense of relief blanketed me before I 
realized that although the class 
might be interesting. I would be 
taught by a no-nonsense drill 
instructor who just happened to be 
a doctor as well. 

Yet, as the weeks went by, my ini-
tial impression of Maisel changed. I 
realized he is quite nice, but he does 
not try to sugar-coat truths that may 
be uncomfortable to hear. I have 
grown to appreciate his bluntness 
because he is honest in his advice. If 
you are smart enough, you will lis-
ten to every single word of it - or at 
least pretend to. He is also funny, 
which makes learnll1g about the 
horrors as well as thejoys of medical 
school very interesting. 

In the few seminars that I have 
attended, I have learned that the 
true method for success requires 
dedication and lots of hard work. 
Plus, more biology and chemistry 
than one could ever dream of. 

However, anxiety about slaving 
away for several years or decades 
may be lessened when med students 
reap the benefits of helping other 
people while being allowed the eco-
nomic opportunity to go to Tahiti (I 
am sure Coco and Chanel will be 
happy to know this) . 

Each seminar encompasses 
everything from positive thinking to 
the rigorous tests administered to 
hapless medical students. In addi-
tion, the casual atmosphere allows 
for students to ask questions with-
out fear of being ostracized in front 
of hundreds of people. Students 
may also voluntarily accompany 
Maisel to the UCSD medical school 
to see what actually goes on in the 
classroom (aside from medical stu-
dents' snoozing). 

This behind-the-scenes look at 
medical life offers students the rare 

.opportunity to learn about the 
admission procedures and different 
medical venue, from the perspec-
tive of a doctor who is in the field 
for something more profound than 
being able to afford a Mercedes 
convertible. Maisel is also on the 
UCSD medical school board of 
admissions, but do not expect an 
internship ( I have already tried it) 
or a glowing recommendation . 
Like the path to "a physician's life: 
you have to work hard to receive 
either.

fllagical assumption 
invalidates position 
ContInIIed frOIII .... I 

RobertSon 's letter should be 
reproduced and handed out to 
Philosophy 10 students, for it con-
tains many informal logical fallacies 
studied in that class. For one, she 
argues that Christianity is true 
because "[itl would have never 
spread" if it was nor true. 111is is a 
classic "appeal to the people" fallacy. 

Furthermore, Robertson argues 
that the "greatest evidence for the 
existence of God is Jesus." Then 
she later supports this by stating 
that Jesus' "most important claim 
was that he is God." So by her rea-
soning, God exists because Jesus 
said so, and Jesus can be trusted 
because a lot of people believed in 
him. Of course, all those people 
believed him because he said he 
was God. 

Robertson's greatest fallacy is 
the fallacy of composition. She 
argues that since parts of the Bible 
are true, then it follows that the 
whole must also be true. So it must 
be true that the cure for leprosy is 
a potion made from the blood of a 
lamb, as Leviticus Chapter 14 
states. [t must also be true that 
hares chew cud (Lev. 11 : 6), bats 
are birds (Lev. 11 : 13), and insects 
havefour legs (Lev. 11 :2 1). 

Furthermore, Robertson duti-
fully ~ints out that the copies of 
the Bible we have today are 95 per-
cent dead-on with the original, 
thus we can trust our copies just as 
much as we can trust the originals. 
Well then, since Jesus said he 
would resurrect in three: days and 
three nights (Matthew 12:40), but 
instead resurrected after two days 
an~ two nights (Matthew 27:32-
28:1, the day after the Sabbath is 
the first day of the week), we can 
throw out our trust in either

source. 
Robertson's most amusing 

argument for establishing the truth 
of the Bible is by referring to the 
Qu'ran. She argues that the Qu'ran 
correlates with parts of the Bible, 
and thus the Bible must be true. 
She fails to mention that the Qu'ran 
is another book with alleged divine 
origins. Her argument is no bener 
than saying that I am honest 
because my mend says I am honest. 
Now, why is my mend honest? 

[n summation, Robertson 
argues that we need to address his-
torical evidence in order to validate 
the Bible. [n that case, Robertson 
should explain to us why Jesus is 
not mentioned by any of his con-
temporaries. !\,hy is there no 
Roman record of his crucifixion? 
Why is there no record that a 
Roman census occurred, as Luke 
claims in Chapter 2? 

I agree with RobertSon that the 
Bible cannot be scrutinized using 
the scientific method, given that 
the Bible is not an observable and 
repeatable phenomenon. However, 
given these conditions, the blatant 
logical fallacies presented by 
Christians can be subjected to the 
scientific method.

Earth Day Has Lost Touch 
With Its Activist Origins 
The movement was originally started in 1970 to 
motivate change from governments and businesses 
By MARIA CASTILUNOS 
Contributing Writer 

Earth Day 2000, held on April 
22, has come and gone. The thou-
sands of enthusiastic self-pro-
claimed "environmentalists" who 
cheerfully campaigned for recy-
cling and protecting endangered 
species have returned to their 
everyday lives without a second 
thought to protecting the Earth. 

Earth Day has grown soft . The 
student-led environmental move-
ment that began 30 years ago was 
not about celebrating. It was not 
about balloons, parades or green 
banners around the city. Earth 
Day was about demonstration, 
action and change. 

Earth Day 1970 was a chal-
lenge to corporate and govern-
mental leaders who were promis-
ing change, but were short-
changing· die necessary programs 
that would bring it about. 

Individual recycling is not 
enough. Recycling must be a col-
lective effort; it must include both 
citizens and big corporations. 
Recycling all the plastic in the 
world is not going to help Earth if 
corporations continue using only 
new plastic. • 

Without collective recycling, 
individual bottles are not going to 
save the millions of unprotected 
acres of forest lands. They are not 
going to provide the necessary 
laws to protect the thousands of 
endangered species throughout 
the world. They will not clean up 
the toxic contaminants in our 
local beaches. They will not pre-

vent oil spills or nuclear acci-
dents. What we need is more of 
those purported environmental-
ists to show they truly care for 
Earth's protection. We need to 
take action. 

We need to make Earth Day 
the day those students 30 years 
ago wanted it to be. We need to 
stop debating over whether solar 
energy, nuclear energy, electrical 
energy or some other form . 
Instead we should turn to more 
cost-efficient and should instead 
turn to human energy and mobi-
lize citizens, demanding that 
Earth and all its creatures, 
resources and beauty be protected 
·for all generations to come. We 
must tell those corporations and 
legislative leaders that they must 
protect the environment. 

What we need are more stu-
dents willing to go further, like 
the many who supported th e 
Earth Day Fair held on April 26 at 
UCSD. As students, we must real-
ize that some of the most suc-
cessful movements were student-
led . The Civil Rights Movement 
and the women's suffrage move-
ment were both brought about by 
the hands of students willing to 
take action on behalf of their 
beliefs. 

I t is now time to take a stand 
on behalf of all the creatures of 
Earth. We must remember that all 
creatures on Earth are intercon-
nected, interrelated and interde-
pendent. For their sake and our 
own, save the Earth - save our-
selves.

Responses onry support

ContInued front ..... 7 
the very epitome of a straw man 
argument, important enough to 
respond to. As a result, Santini 
wrote- an article that refuted the 
previous article's implication that 
science has somehow "proven" the 
Bible to be true ("Science Cannot 
Verify the Truth of the Bible; April 
24). Ever since then, the Guardian 
has yet to run an issue that lacks an 
overly verbose regurgitation of 
third-rate Christian apologism. 

Curiously, while thes.e letters 
have claimed to be arguing against 
Santini 's argument, their repetition 
of the claim that standard scientific 
methods do not apply to the Bible 
only supports his argument. 

Considering the mostly nega-
tive response to the Michael cam-
paign, I wonder why the Guardian 
has decided to dedicate so much 
space to a non issue such as the 
question of whether there are 
parts of the Bible that are true.

Popu" Appe" Does 
Not Make Bible True 

Editor: 
I am a bit fed up seeing the let-

ters wrirten by members of the reli-
gious cult known as Christianity, 
who claim that this or that wild 
stretch of illogic "proves" the valid~ 
ity of their faith or holy text, but 
then tum around and say that for 
some odd reason, believers of the 
Bible are somehow above having to 

support their outrageous claims 
honestly and scientifically. 

Either their baseless assertions 
can be examined with the same 
degree of skepticism and scrutiny 
as any other historical event, or 
their texts are just stories that they 
choose to believe and as such can-
not be acknowledged as undoubt-
edly true. I am sorry kids, but you 
cannot have it both ways. 

To Christine Robertson in par-
ticular: There is nothing at all 
"unique" about your religion. In 
fact, most of it was pilfered from the 
ancient Greek mystery cults and 
Gnosticism. 

Just because your religion 
"spread" following the death of 
Jesus does not show that he was 
really resurrected - no more so 
than the spread of Buddhism out of 
India proves that Siddhartha 
Gautama truly achieved Nirvana or 
the spread of Islam throughout the 
world proves that Mohammed was 
without a doubt the last prophet of 
God. How could they? Or are you 
suggesting that the spread of any 
religion over time proves all the 
claims of their holy seers and 
sacred texts? In that case, the Koran 
and Bhagvad Gita are also undeni-
ably true. As are the video testimo-
nials of that goofy bald guy from 
the Heaven's Gate group. 

Just because a lot of people 
believe someone rose from the 
dead in no way suggests that he or 
she really did. Neither would eye-
witness accounts showing that this 
person did not resurrect necessari-
ly prevent a sizable number of peo-
ple from believing the bizarre "ris-
ing from the dead" theory anyway. 

More importantly, the claim of 
the possibility of creatures resur-
recting can be tested scientifically. 
How many dead people have been 
shown to have resurrected after 
being dead forthree days? None! If 
you wish to suggest otherwise, and 
disprove a lot of what we know 
about biology, you had better pre-

OPINION 7 

sent some "observable and repeat-
able" evidence. 

If you make an extremely ques-
tionable claim, like saying you can 
walk through walls, people will 
expect you to verify this. Just saying 
"you can't prove I don't" would not 
be enough. Nor would writing a 
diary about your wall-walking 
experiences prove it ei ther, even if 
you included a lot of historically 
accurate sidenotes in it. Even 
though Bill Clinton was elected 
president, the sentence "Bill 
Clinton was elected president, and I 
passed through the Great Wall of 
China like a ghost" does not prove 
you really did. 

As far as I am concerned, you 
can continue to blindly believe 
whatever mindless myth you 
choose to, but if you do put forth a 
claim that something is true, or that 
YOll have proof that what you 
believe is accurate, do not cry foul 
when the open-minded demand 
verifiable evidence and at least a 
semireasonable argument from you. 

Follow whichever deities you 
wish, I complctely respect that. 
However, if you want to convince 
anyone who is not alrcady brain-
washed, please be prepared to back 
yourself up. 

You were right about one thing. 
though, "If thc 'adventures' of Jesus 
were pure invention, the Gospels 
would have never lasted long under 
scrutiny." Completely correct. They 
do not. For the most pan, they have 
lasted only thanks to the wistful fan-
tasies of their believers and, more 
often than not , by sheer force. The 
Gospels are not even consistent with 
one another, and are less consistent 
with the prophecies of the old testa-
ment - the messiah was supposed 
to be a king. my mends. 

Anything can be predicted if you 
take the prophecies metaphorically. 
Heck, I am the king of my town-
house, maybe I am your savior.

World News Conflict: 
Putin Inaugurated as Russia's Second President Rifle-toting former soldiers roamed the streets 

MOSCOW - Beneath a gilded 
sunburst in a gilded palace, his 
hand on a red leather-bound copy 
of the constitution, Vladimir Putin 
swore an oath Sunday to "respect 
and guard the human and civil 
rights" of Russia and became, offi-
cially at last, its second pres ident. 

Much of Russia - and the 
world - now waits to see what he 
will do with the title. Many expect 
a quick push to overhaul Russia 's 
inscrutable tax code and economy 
and to reassert Krem lin rule over 
its 89 provinces - goals suppos-
edly too risky to chase when he 

was but an acting leader. 
Putin, who has dropped only the 

broadest hints of an agenda since 
he abruptly succeeded President 
Boris Yeltsin last New Year's Eve. 
revealed nothing more Sunday. 

In a brief speech after his 
swearing-in, Putin said he would 
perform his duties openly and 
honestly, "guided only by the 
interests of the state." 

"I consider it my sacred duty to 
unite the people of Russia, to 
gather citizens around clearly 
defined tasks and aims and to 
remember, every minute of every 

day, that we are one nation and 
one people: he said. "We have one 
common future." 

Although known as prosecutor 
of a war in Chechnya that has 
brought fresh accusations of 
Russian authorities trampling on 
human rights, Putin on Sunday 
made much, oratorically and sym-
bolically, of the step toward democ-
racy that his inauguration repre-
sented. The ceremony, he noted, 
completed the first legal and demo-
cratic transfer of executive power in 
Russia's 1.1 OO-year history. 

Underscoring that, Yeltsin stood 

beside him, on a flower-bedecked 
podium in the Kremlin Grand 
Palace, throughout the ceremony. 

"We can be proud that this is 
being done peacefully, without 
revolutions and putsches, in a 
respectful and free way,· Yeltsin 
said in remarks to the crowd. 
"This is possible only in a new 
Russia, one in which people have 
learned to live and think freely." 

Four months after his early res-
ignation, Yeltsin appeared healthy 
but spoke slowly.

China Cracks Down on Vocal Uber.' Intellectuals 

Rifle-toting former soldiers who 
had fought against the government 
and who should long have been 
disarmed, under the terms of a 
peace accord that was reached nine 
months ago, roamed the streets. 
Hundreds of. them assembled at 
the national stadium after the:ir 
Ic:ader, Lt. Col. Johnny Paul 
Koroma, the: chief of a junta that 
briefly controlled Sierra Leone: in 
1997, said on national radio that 
no one had a monopoly on vio-
lence. BEIJING - China's leaders are 

trying to rein in a growing and 
increasingly assertive liberal intellec-
tual movement, criticizing promi-
nent academics and authors in 
speeches, forbidding newspapers 
from running their articles and pun-
ishing or shutting down publishers 
who have brought out their work. 

In recent years, unofficial and 
quasi-official outlets for liberal 
poli tical ideas have multiplied 
rapidly in China - on the Internet, 
in informal discussion groups, in 
magazines and books that result 

from collaborations between inde-
pendent editors and state publish-
ers. At a time of rapid economic 
and social change, China's leaders 
clearly view this trend as a threat to 
their political power. 

Despite his Western-leaning 
economies, President Jiang Zemin 
has in the last year constantly reit-
erated the importance of standing 
fast by Communist ideology in a 
China overrun with dot-com start-
ups. In the last few months, those 
admonitions have led to a series of 
punitive actions against writers

Microsoft: 
Company will attack 
government breakup plan 
Continued from ,..e 1 
over the last two years. The 
Microsoft concessions, according to 
people close to the talks, have cov-
ered opening up the company's 
pricing, contracts and the sharing of 
technical informauon with industry 
partners and rivals. 

The specific steps have included 
allowing personal computer mak-
ers greater freedom to modifY 
Microsoft's Windows desktop 
screen, ensuring that rival software 
makers get equal access to techni-
cal information about the Windows 
operating system, and curbing the 
company's abi lity to enter into con-
tracts with computer makers and 
Internet service providers that limit 
their ability to use and promote 
competing software. 

Another Microsoft proposal, 
according to people close to the 
talks, has been to offer standard 
prices, adjusted for the volume, to 
PC makers licenSing the company's 
industry-standard Windows oper-
ating system - addressing the alle-
gation in the antitrust case that 

Microsoft has used Windows pric-
ing as a way to reward friendly com-
panies and punish companies that 
deal closely with Microsoft foes. 

Microsoft has little choice: but 
to engage in what it regards as the 
unpalatable exercise of recom-
mending sanctions against itself. 
At a scheduling hearlng in early 
April, Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson told the Microsoft legal 
team that on May 10 it had to give 
the COUrt its answer to the gov-
ernment proposal including its 
counterproposals. 

Microsoft, in its filing, will like-
ly direct its strongest fire at simply 
attacking the government plan to 
break the company into two -
one with the Windows operating 
system business, and a second 
company with the Office produc-
tivity programs like the Word word 
processing and Excel spreadsheet 
software and other businesses like 
the MS N Internet service. 

The government plan , Micro-
soft says, is "extreme and radical" 
- an unjustified and dangerdus . 
gamble with a company that has 
contributed greatly to America's 
high-technology economy.

perceived as straying too far in a 
liberal or reformist direction. 

"It's a very tense time," said a 
prominent professor, who like oth-
ers would speak only if not identi-
fied. "President Jiang is very unhap-
py with some things that friends 
have written. He wants to under-
take some ideological cleansing." 

Chinese liberals say the timing 
of the intense criticisms, after 
years of stuttering but slowly 
.expanding intellectual freedom, is 
probably related to Communist 
Party politics. 

They say China's leaders are 
nervous about the liberalizing 
forces that could be unleashed by 
China's expected entry into the 
World lrade Organization, as early 
as this year. They add that Zemin's 
tenure as president and party 
leader will probably end in the 
next few years and that he is trying 
to burnish his image to maintain 
some role for himself in the future. 
That means turning down the vol-
ume of critics.

Clinton Sets Patients' Rights Meeting 
WASHINGTO White 

House officials and Democrats in 
Congress say they have become con-
cerned that negotiations on a bill to 
define patients' rights have stalled. 

President Clinton has sum-
moned 10 members of Congress to 
the White House in an effort to 
galvanize talks on the issue, one of 
his party's top legislative priorities 
this year. 

Democrats do not accuse the 
Republicans of bad faith, but say the 
negotiations have become enmeshed 
in a slow, frustrating process that 
seems to be leading nowhere. Each 

party says the other is responsible. 
Last year the Senate and the 

House passed very different ver-
sions of the legislation, which 
would for the first time establish 
comprehensive federal standards 
for private htalth insurance, espe-
cially health maintenance organim-
tions and other forms of managed 
care. For decades, insurance has 
been regulated mainly by the states. 

The negotiations are widely 
viewed here as a major test of the 
leadership abili ties of Sen. Don 
Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the 
House-Senate conference commit-

tee. 
As assistant majority leader of 

the Senate, Nickles has repeatedly 
shown his ability to round up 
Republican votes. But never before 
has he faced such a public test of 
his ability to forge compromises 
with Democrats on complo issues 
with immense political overtones. 

Disappointed at the pace of 
negotiations, Clinton invited lead-
ing conferees from both parties to 
the meeting, tentatively set for 
Thursday.

JLandmark of Diversity' Closes in L.A 
LOS ANGELES - For the last 

five years, Jacqueline Sowell has 
loved to wake up in the morning, 
put on her uniform and go to work 
as a waitress in the coffee shop at 
the Holiday Bowl, a faded bowling 
alley on a faded street in the faded 
Crenshaw district west of down-
town Los Angeles. 

"It's like a United Nations in 
there: she said. "Our employees 
are Hispanic, white, black, 
Japanese, Thai, Filipino. I've served 
grits to as many Japanese cus-

tomers as I do black. We've learned 
from each other and given to each 
other. It's much more than just a 
bowling alley. It's a community 
resource.· 

Shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday, 
after 42 years of strikes, spares and 
brotherhood, in Sowell's words, 
the Holiday Bowl was closed. The 
building is being sold. According 
to the property owner, Marshall 
Siskin, the bowling alley has been 
losing money for 15 yc:ars. 

"Like all things," Siskin said, 

"it's reached a point where it has to 
change." Maybe so, but not with-
out a fight, Sowell said. A few 
hours after the last balls thundered 
down the lanes, a group of her 
neighbors, co-workers and friends 
were standing outside, holding 
signs, dec/aring the Bowl "A 
Landmark of Diversity" and urging 
the new owners and the city to 
"Preserve Not De:stroy."

Summer Program Builds Bridges for Admittees 
Students from underpriviledged high schools get extra support from outreach program 

By MALAVIKA UNGOLLY 
Staff Writer 

Each year, 700 incoming freshmen are 
invited to participate in UCSD's annual 
Summer Bridge program. The progra~, 
which is sponsored by UCSD's AcademiC 
lransition Program and O.A.S.LS., pro-
vides incoming freshmen with the chance 
to live on campus for four weeks before 
they attend UCSD. . . 

Summer Bridge, which has been 10 
existence for 2~ years, .serves as a reten-
tion program With a pnmary goal of con-
veying the importance of a col~ege educa-
tion to its participants. Admlttees from 
California schools that consistently pro-
duce the lowest number of UC-eligible 
students are invited to join the program. 
The program targets students who attend 
schools that rank in the bottom one fifth 
according to the number of UC-bound 
students that they generate. By doing this, 
the program prOVides guidance ro stu-
dents who have excelled in bottom-tier 
high schools. 

To apply, students are required to com-
plete: an application as well as a personal 
statement. Applications are then judged 
on the content of the personal statement, 
the student's high school grade point aver-
age, as well as the economic status of the 
student. First-generation college studen!s 
are given preference, but the program IS 
not need-based. 

Agustfn Orozco, coordinator of 
Summer Bridge, stresses that the program 
serves as a retention effort for incoming 
students. 

"We want to makes sure to reach 
these students in their first year at 
UCSD." Orozco said . "This is vital 
be:cause the purpose of our program is to 
motivate these students to stay and grad-
uate:." 

Participants in the program are given 
the opportunity to earn five units of col, 
lege credit by completing Contemporary 
Issues I, as well as a math or science 
enrichment activity. 

The contemporary issues course 
focuses on issues such as immigration 
and racism that challenge students who 
are trying to achieve a higher education 
in California and highlights issues such 
as diversity and affi rmative action . 
According to the Summer Bridge infor-

mational booklet, students who enroll in 
this class learn to develop their writing, 
communication and critica l thinking 
skills. 

The booklet states that the math or sci-
ence enrichment activity is designed to 
strengthen the students' problem-solving 
skills, which are necessary in order to suc-
ceed at UCSD. 

Above all, the program stresses the 
importance of building social relation -
ships with other students, a~ well . as 
being able to work collaboratlvely With 
others. 

The students who participate in the 
program, including a number of students 
who plan to commute in the fall, live 
together for four weeks in an on-campus 
residence hall . This provides an opportu-
nity for the students to ma~e friends while 
providing a good study enVlronme~t: 

The program reqUIres that participants 
spend each night on campus, although 
students are alfowed to visit home occa-
sionally. St~~e.nts a ls~ pa:ticipate in recre-
ational actiVIties while 10 the program. 
Such activities include dances. cultural 
programs and trips to the beach. 

Although more than 700 people are 
invited to apply, the program is quite ~elec­
tive. ApprOXimately 150 of the applicants 
are accepted. Although the program lasts 
only four weeks, it is part of a yearlong 
Acade:mic lransition Program, or ATP. 
ATP was created to help first -year students 
get 'the most out of their experie:nce at 
UCSD. All students who attend the sum-
mer program are then required to partici-
pate in ATP services throughout the regu-
lar school year. 

The Summer Bridge informational 
booklet states that the services include 
tutoring, one-on-one conferences wi th 
ATP staff and referrals to campus depart-
ments. These programs ensure that partic-
ipants are given the proper guidance and 
assistance during the remainder of thClr 
years spent at UCSD. 

The Summer Bridge program has 
earned rave reviews from the students who 
have participated. 

"The Summer Bridge program had an 
incredible impact on my first year at 
UCSD," one past participant commented. 
"The program was able to provide me with 
the proper guidance necessary in order to 
succeed in my academic pursuits." 

'MJ: Radio' Entertains Audience with New Style 
Local radio show host wins $5,000 scholarship in national contest for talking it up on the air 
Contributirw Writer 

When one thinks of the big 
names in talk radio, Howard Stern 
is usually the first name that 
comes to mind. He is the self-
proclaimed "King of All Media: 
the quintessential shock jock. It's 
hard to think of talk radio without 
him. Stern wannabies have flood-
ed the air with their wild ideas and 
their quick-witted insults. Thus 
far, no one seems to be able to 
overthrow Stern as the king of 
radio, but the revolution is com-
ing. The first signs of turmoil in 
Stern's kingdom have begun here 
at UCSD. 

A new breed of talk radio has 
taken root at KSDT. Aaron Feiger 
is the vanguard of th!s rev?lution, 
with Joe Basich as hiS maIO man. 
Together they have Geated a 
show of unparalleled popularity. 
With a strong supportive audi-
ence and an ever-growing listener 
base, "Mr. Radio: as Feiger's show 
is called, is extremely addictive. It 
only took a few minutes of listen-
ing to his show for most to 

become: hooked. 
Inspired by Lysander Spooner 

(a Civil War-e:ra American 
philosopher), Salvador DaU, 
Howard Stern and Izzy Izzard (a 
British comedian), Feiger's show 
covers a wide range of to pies. 
Sometimes he uses the micro-
phone as a soapbox and other 
times for self-gain ; the show is 
never du ll . 

On one particularly self-fulfill-
ing show, Feiger spent the evening 
taking calls to find a pair female lis-
teners to join him in a menage-a-
trois. To his disappointment, the 
offer received no takers, but the 
phone rang off the hook. 

In a broadcast about the things 
guys and girls could do to attract 
each other, based on an excerpt 
from a magazine article Feiger had 
read, he and Basich contemplated 
dozens of pick-up techniques and 
ways to get girls. "Would this 
work?" Feiger would ask, J'rod-
ding listeners to call in an give 
advice or arguments. Needless to 
say, the phones were lit up all 
night, even after the show went 
off the air. 

"I have a good time," Feiger 
said. " Joe Basich, my co-host, has 
a good time. The guests have a 
good time, and the audience has a 
good time. That is what it is all 
about." 

It's not all fun and games, 
though, as Feiger describes. 

"The show does have serious 
moments: he said . "I am very 
politically oriented - Libertarian 
- but overall the point of it is to 
buck society a little bit, forget 
about the pressure to be cool all 
the time and just let loose." 

Feiger pointed out that though 
the show is titled "Mr. Radio," he is 
not Mr. Radio. Instead, the name 
was inspired by a restaurant called 
Mr. Sushi in Pacific Beach. 

The show's popularity exploded 
and is now this year's Young 
American Broadcasters' scholar-
ship winner. Feiger attended an 
awards ceremony in New York and 
was given a $5000 prize for his 
show. 

The day before the scholarship 
application deadline, KSD~ 
Operations Manager Ram i 
Apelian sent a 15-minute sample 

tape of "Mr. Radio" to the Young 
American Broadcasters on a 
whim. 

"[The applicationl seemed like 
junk mail at first," Apelian said. 
"For some reason I responded, 
using Fed-Ex overnight. Two 
weeks later we were told [the 
showl won! · 

Feiger is not a wannabe. 
Howard Stem's show pales in com-
parison. 

Feiger is not rude and insulting 
for ratings. Feiger comes off as si~­
cere in his opinions and speaks hiS 
mind freely without concern. The 
show deals mainly with sex - lots 
of sex - girls and reactions to var-
ious things in the world fro m a col-
lege perspective. 

It is the honesty in the show 
that is so captivating. Feiger despis-
es "all the fakeness on the radio." 
He says "i t is like listening to Saran 
wrap and plaster. [ would like to see 
more individuality. The hosts 
should be more human, not so 
technical." 

It is this realism and the truth 
Feiger speaks that keep the listen-
ers coming back show after show. 

One of Feiger's own favorite 
shows was an interview he did 
with, Michael Carley, the person-
ality behind the "I Agree with 
Michael " campaign earlier in the 
year. 

"I actually got criticized fo r not 
jum ping on him more since the 
show has a reputation for being 
pro-sex, craziness and open-mind-
edness," Feiger said. "My response 
the next week was that Michael is a 
nice kid who believes in some-
thing. The whole point of that par-
ticular show was to allow the lis-
teners to have a go at him. I had 
already said my piece during the 
fi rst hour." 

Feiger, who is currently intern-
ing at a talk radio news service in 
Washington , will be back next 
year, and so will the show. Last 
year, the show aired Tuesdays 
from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. ext year 's 
schedule may change, but the 
content will not. The show will be 
back and "better than ever: 
according to Feiger. 

"I got some good ideas and

The Editor's Soapbox 
Spam is seen in a new light as it is thrown into the vast melting pot that is the United States of America 
By DAVID LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Spam brings a smile to my face 
whenever I think of it, but thiS was 
not always the case. To me. Spam 
was never something I considered 
Amrrican. In actuality, [ always 
thought of it as explicitly Korean 
(by the way, [ am Korean) . 
Although I hold fond memories of 
Mom cooking up some Spam and 
eggs for Saturday morning break-
fast, my dearest moments with this 
canned meat involve nights when 
my sister and [ would share rice left 
over in the cooker with some slices 
of Spam, not cooked, but straight 
out of the can. Garnish it with a lit-
tle kimchee (pickled cabbage for 
the uninitiated), and you had what 
Americans have endearingly 
termed "comfort food." What can I 
say? Some people ate mac 'n' 
cheese or chicken soup for com-
fort; [ ate Spam and kimchee when 
the days got a little gloomy. 

However, Spam was a little 
more than comfort food to us. I 
cannot recall how many stories 
Mom and Dad use to me tell about 
Spam being coveted more than 
gold during the Korean War. The 
international media have recently 
published stories of Korean ·com-
fort women" who were subjugated 
by [mperial Japan into prostitution. 
However, where were all those sto-
ries of American soldiers who 
would trade lighters and gum for 
sex from these same 13-year-old 
girls? Of course, how can [ even 
bring up such a subject when 
Uncle Sam heroically sent his sol-
diers to save my pathetic home-

land, just like he did for those poor 
souls in Iraq and Serbia. But, as my 
Dad would say, "That's war." 

That is what hardwired not only 
my parents but their whole genera-
tion toward an inevitable sense of 
fatalism. Not to say that they still 
don't bitch every time Hawkeye 
and B.j. from "M.A.S.H." show up 
on the screen for making the war 
look like a martini parl)', but their 
curses always ended With a "well, 
what can you do· feeling. I am 
diverging from the point, though. 

For my parents, Spam was a 
token of their survival, a constant 
reminder of how shitty life could 
truly be. Somewhere in all that 
brouhaha, though, many Koreans 
began to grow a taste for Hormel's 
top-selling "pork with ham" prod-
uct. In my own biased opinion, it's 
really not that bad - just ask any 
Hawaiian native. 

With all this in mind, my rela-
tionship to Spam might become a 
link clearer. I did not have to deal 
with any type of embarrassment 
toward Spam until much later in 
my life. I spent a majority of my 
adolescence with the kids of 
Guatemalan and Salvadoran 
"immigrants" in Los Angeles dur-
ing the early '80s. All of us under-
stood that we came from complete-
ly different worlds, and although 
they would mock me occasionally, 
when it came down to it, they liked 
eating Spam too - the same wa~ I 
loved eating mangoes doused with 
salt and chili pepper. 

My high school experience can 
be best summed up as one United 
Colors of Bennetton commercial. [ 
attended a small private school that 

One night, all I wanted 
was Spam, rice and 
kimchee. I had some rice, 
no kimchee that night, 
but did have a can of 
Spam hidden back in the 
pantry. Without any 
though, I took everything 
out, desperately needing 
some comfort with mom 
4, 000 miles away. 

was comprised mostly of blacks 
and Asians with a small minority of 
whites and Latinos. By that time. 
Spam was something that was not 
hidden from the public, as many of 
my friends were also Korean, but 
merely not spoken about unless it 
were the subject of a joke. For my 
fellow Korean friends. Spam was 
something we all enjoyed but never 
something we ever really craved, 

COME VISIT YOUR NEW 

but that is the same for all types of 
comfort food. You only need it 
when your Oedipal complex rises 
and you need your mommy to say 
"it's okay honey." Because of my 
school's diversity, cultural celebra-
tion was always tantamount. 
Within the student body, every-
body recognized each other's dif-
ferences, as exhibited with jokes 
and harmless slurs, not through 
means such as hate mail, and a 
respect was kindled from that 
diversity. 

I never really thought about 
Spam until I got to college. I 
remember the first time I took a 
group of college friends out to eat 
some Korean food, none being 
Korean . There were some who 
were completely adventurous and 
tried everything. Now I will be the 
first to admit, there are some 
funky-smelling dishes in Korean 
cuisine. I do not expect everyone to 
orgasm at the mouth with the first 
taste of kimchee. [n fact, I do not 
expect people to like kimchee on 
the whole as experience dictates. 
That is not what bothered me. 
What bothered me was the way 
certain people were looking at me 
as I was enjoying the food they 
chose to decline. Again, [ expected 
people to cringe. After a while, 
however, I felt as if I was the guy in 
"[ndiana Jones: The Temple of 
Doom" who ate the giant beetles 
and apes' brains. They were not 
·staring" at me, but I could feel 
their slight repugnance. All in all, [ 
have inherited my parents' "oh 
well, that's life" attitude and that is 
how [ handled it. That is life.

parents left for Korea, and [ was 
alone to hold the Western front. 
One night, all I wanted was Spam, 
rice and kimchee. [ had some rice, 
no kimchee that night, but did have 
a can of Spam hidden back in the 
pantry. Without any thought, I 
took everything out, desperately 
needing some comfort with mom 
4,000 miles away. After the first bite 
and swallow, [ felt like my whole 
body was on a heroin dive, sinking 
into pleasure and memories long 
forgotten . It made me think about 
Mom and Dad and how shiny I felt 
for being embarrassed of a food 
that they had once begged for. It 
made me even more frustrated 
knowing that if I explained to my 
friends what this absurd piece of 
packaged meat meant to me, they 
would surely respond with one of 
those "hey man, I was only joking" 
comments. My meal was interrupt-
ed in the middle with my friends 
coming in and immediately starting 
their moans and groans. 

The reason for me not saying 
anything is based upon my own 
fundamental ideology on American 
racism. Long-standing Americans, 
be they of French or Chinese 
descent, tend to forget their cultur-
al roots and get caught up in the 
American mainstream, which is 
still dominated by white culture. 
American culture is slowly dipping 
into its melting pot for new defini-
tion, but the process is slow. 

That is as far as I go with my 
ethnic studies lecture. In essence, I 
am just here to state my case about 
Spam, and [ think some people out

Students Aide in Fashion Show Spam: A rant about Spam reaches a close 
Local students participate in fashion show to benefit home Jor domestic violence victims ContInued froIII ..... 10 there might sympathize with 

me. However, I am not bitching 
about the "white" race, but to 
those who have replaced their 
native culture with Burger King 
and Coca-Cola. I understand it 
is varsity blues for many 
Americans who cannot seem to 
understand the chips on so 
many minority shoulders. All I 
can personally say is that it is 
annoying when you go to a 
friend's house and the toilet 
paper is hanging the wrong 
way. You are not going to say 
anything, but for the rest of 
your life, you will think of the 
person as the guy who hangs 
the paper the wrong way. I am 
sure there are better analogies, 
but that toilet paper thing per-
sonally annoys the shit out of 
me. 

Staff Writttr 

Seldom does one think of fashion when 
talking about domestic violence. The two 
usually have nothing to do with one anoth-
er. 

However, both will make an unlikely 
couple this week when a campus club 
known as Express to Success hosts 
"Summer Expressions: Charity Fashion 
Show & Raffle." 

A pilot program in its first year, ETS was 
designed to help students improve their pub-
lic speaking and interpersonal communica-
tion skills. 

The fashion show will assist Becky's 
House, a transitional home for victims of 
domestic violence. 

"[ hope that [through the fashion showl 
we can ancrease awareness of what kind of 
domestic abuse is out there and help in our 
own linle way," said Monica Zakowski, co-
hostn5 for the event. 

1M clothing modeled will be from Banana 
Republic;, GAP, Old Navy, Eddie Bauer and 
Wilson's Leather. 

Revelle freshman Liz Roesch enjoyed the 
idea of modeling for the show. 

"It's goOd to raise money for something 
like Becky's House, " Roesch said. "[It'sl help-
ing not only to improve (victims') situations 
but also those of their families. " 

ETS member run Undfdt added to this 
sentiment. 

·It helps out a lOod cause, gives our club 
some publicity ancr allows some stores to dis-
play their clothing." Lindfelt said. -It's a win-
win situation for everybody." 

Approximately SO students from ErS will 
participa~ in the show, including a few non-
members. 

For some models. like freshman Brian 
Randol. performing for the show will be a 
challenge. 

"I know that I'll be nervous in the begin-
ning. but by doing this. ['II be conquering one 
of my fears; Randol said. 

Aiding in the efforts of the fashion show 
will be two professional companies: STRUT 
International and Escapade Inc. The two 
have helped in coordinating the event, 
including its choreography and production 
design. 

According to Escapade, Director Leilani 
Williams, preparing for the show was a plea-
sure. 

"The students have worked very hard and 
have dedicated so much of their time and 
effort toward such a worthy cause as Becky's 
House." Williams said. "It has been a wonder-
ful experience working with the models of 
Express to Success and STRUT 
International. " 

According to Revelle staff member 
Laverne Williams-Schoonover, coordinator of 
college and community development and 
advisor for ETS, the fuhion show will be a fit-
ting end to the year for its members. 

"This is a wonderful opportunity for the 
students to incorporate the skills they have 
learned from the past year," Williams-
Schoonover said. "Their work is helping to 
benefit Becky's House while establishing 
friendsh~ and enhancing the meaning of 
commumty." 

The foUowing stortS and organizations 
have donated baskets to be raft1cd off: Eddie 
Bauer of urc. Sephora of Fashion Valley, 
The Body Shop of I'ashion Valley, Crabtree & 
Evelyn, Gap, Aveda, Wilson's Leather, the 
UCSD Bookstore, UCSD Transportation 
Services and many more. Donations will also 
be acccptrd. 

"Summer Expressions: Charity Fashion

p.m. in Plaza Cafe. For tickets or more

Of course, I have been bitch-

my cuisine might taste strange

By ureA C. BLACK 
Tribune Media Services 

AlMa (March 21-April19) 
Watch for bargains this week. 

On Monday find an excellent 
deal on a household item. On 
Tuesday and Wednesday you and 
somebody you love should dis-
cuss senous topics and make 
some big decisions. Thursday 
and Friday are your busiest 
workdays this week, so schedule 
accordingly. On Sunday do 
somethin$ that's educational and 

·fun - WIth your favorite play-
mate. 

, __ (April 2(Mfay 20) 
You're still powerful this 

week. On Monday catch up on 
your reading so you can choose 
wisely on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Life could look a lot 
easier on Thursday and Friday. If 
you can put off making a big deal 
until Friday, it'll probably go 
more in your favor. Plenty will 
keep you busy over the weekend 
since you've had zero time for 
chores all week. 

...... (May 21·)une 21) 
You might have a heavy feel-

ing this week. That's just because 
you're tackling some tough jobs. 

Monday will be better than most 
for budgeting. If you need to go 
back to school, think about it 
from Thesday through Thursday 
and sign up on Friday. Over the 
weekend you may have time to do 
something fun with the people 
you love. Far horizons beckon. 

CMcer (June 22·July 22) 
You and your friends do some 

heavy-duty bonding this week. 
You emerge as a natural leader 
on Monday. Be careful with your 
money on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Keep it in your 
pocket. You'll figure out what 
was really going on by Thursday 
and Friday. Have friends over this 
weekend, especially the ones 
you've been promising for ages. 

Leo (July 2J.Aug. 22) 
You may feel like a lid's on 

your progress. Pass the test this 
week, and you'll lift it. Finish up 
last week's business on Monday. 
You're strong and opinionated 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. You 
also have strong opposition. 
Those are probably your test 
days. Ask for an increase in your 
allowance on Thursday or Friday. 
Spend the weekend with your 
true love and friends. If you don't 
have the fonner, the latter may be 
able to provide one for you. 

... (AUf. 2J.Sept. 22) 
Higher education, travel and 

philosophy are still major focal 
points. Friends can help you 
achieve your goals on Monday, 
so let them know what you want. 
Things could get kind of jammed 
up on Thesday and Wednesday. 
Curtail travel then. Plan to get 
away on Thursday and Friday, 
instead. You could find a bargain 
or a better job over the weekend. 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 15 

CI~O~,~\vOI(l) 
LIIII'I (Sept. 2J.Oct. 23) 

Are you a wise investor? 
Study this week, and you could 
be one. Listen to an older person 
on Monday but make your own 
decisions. A group will be helpful 
on Thesday and Wednesday, but 
they may not know it all, either. 
Use your good sense. You could 
make a good prjvate deal on 
Thursday or Friday. This week-
end should be good for romance 
- Sunday especially. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
You should be able to see the 

big picture on Monday. Work 
with a partner, and money could 
come your way. Getting anything 
accomplished on Tuesday and 
Wednesday may be difficult. Be 
patient. The logjam starts to break 
up on Thursday, but it may be 
Friday before you can reach a 
compromise. Be assertive about 
what you want. Take care of the 
stuff you've been putting off this 
weekend and have company over. 

~ (Nov. 22·Dec. 21) 
You're still busy this week. 

You may have to invest on 
Monday, but you may be able to 
get help from a backer then, too. 
Pack a lunch on Thesday and 
Wednesday; you won't have time 
to go out. Somebody's watching 
you with a critical eye on 
Thursday and Friday, so play by 
the rules. Goof off with friends 
over the weekend to celebrate 
your awesome accomplishments. 

C ...... (Dec. 22·)an. 19) 
Love's your main theme again 

this week. Form a partnership -
the forever kind - on Monday. 
Figure out what you can and

"a beautiful blonde [he) was dating

Feiger admits that he was ner-

own show. 

To Feiger's fans who are won-
dering what's in store for Feiger 
and the "Mr. Radio" show, he says 
he plans to focus on radio.

on taking SALUTE further than 
radio. With video and theater pro-
jects coming up in the near future, 
it sounds as if Feiger will keep him-

ning candidate for next year's oper-

goals of becoming a professional 
radio personality may be just the 
beginning of his career. 

Feiger said that he does the

Apelian encourages anyone 
who is interested in the station to 
come by the KSOT offices, located 
in the Student Center by the

Salute: 
Underdassmen will need tD step 
up to replace departing soccer stars 

whole team." 
Song was a midfielder and enjoyed three 

goals and three assists the past two years. 
Song is Fduating this June with a man-

agement science degree. 
"I'll probably go into consulting or be an 

analyst." Song said. 
His soccer future is in question. 
"I'm not so sure right now if I'm going to 

go to a semi-pro team," Song said. "I am 
going to play, I just don't know with who." 

Song picked up some valuable life 
lessons while being a Triton. 

"Heart and hard work," Song said of the 
key to success. "To go all out." 

Midfielder Glebov scored three goals and 
dished out four assists this past year. 

Glebov, who already graduated in the fall 
with a management science degree, has 
recently joined the Riverside County Elite, a 
Division III professional league, a feeder 
team for the Flash A-team. 

"I learned a lot of teamwork and built a 
lot of confidence in myself and the team to 
work under pressurc," Glebov said. "For 
now I'm just going to see where [things go 
witl! the Riverside County Elite) . Maybe I'll 
go to Europe this summer." 

Sanders, a forward who scored four goals 

and five assists his last two years, would also 
like to go the route of Glebov but is focus-
ing on medical school. 

"I'm not sure [about my soccer future)," 
Sanders said. "I plan on going to med school 
first." 

Sanders learned some valuable informa-
tion from being a Triton. . 

"You just put a lot of effort into some-
thing: Sanders said. "Everyone has to work 
hard to accomplish a goal." 

Forward Hamilton, defender Benowitz 
and mid fielder Adams are also leaving. 

Benowitz had a great year this past sea-
son, scoring three goals. 

Adams has had a fantastic career, scoring 
21 goals and 12 assists. 

Bernard mayor may not be back next 
year. His stats speak for themselves in their 
importance. He scored 13 goals and dished 
eight assists in three years of action. 

Curtolo is the star goalkeeper for the 
Tritons. He has logged 163 saves in 50 
games over the past three years. His goals 
peer game average was an outstanding .66 
this past season. CUrIolo has just a couple 
of classes left to be finished with school 
and still has a year of playing eligibility. 
Returning to the Tritons depends on how 
his summer traveling plans pan out. 

"I'm traveling to Argentina," Curtolo 
said . "I'm visiting family and hopefully will 
play some soccer. If I come back in time [I 
may play for the team) . It would be fun to 
come back. I'm definitely always looking 
forward to it."

Soccer Team Says Goodbye to Seven Seniors 
Coach Armstrong will have a difficult time replacing many of his main offensive threats and defensive leaders

There is an exodus taking place 
from the UCSD men's soccer team.

Moses, but that of graduation. 

Seven members of the men 's 
soccer team , which finished the 
1999 soccer season 12-4, are to 
graduate this June or have already 
graduated th is year. On top of that, 
there are two more star players 
whose fu tures are uncertain.

Thompson sees some soccer 
involvement in the future. 

"I've coached some camps 
through the school," Thompson 
said. "I won't be playing, but I'll 
coach a bit." 

His senior year was the most 
memorable of the four for 
Thompson. 

Tyler Thompson, Cameron 
Adams, Robert Benowicz, Bryan 
Song and Michael Hamilton are to 
graduate this June. Aleksander 
Glebov and Mike Sanders have 
already finished their education.al 
duties but still need to walk at 
commencement. Lucas Curtolo 
and Brady Bernard are almost 
done with their college careers, but 
each still has a year of eligibility 
left, and next year's activities are a 
little hazy. 

"This last year was a really good 
year: Thompson said. "It did suck 
to lose in the first round of the 
playoffs (a 3-1 penalty loss to 
Trinity College of Texas after play-
ing to 0-0), but it was a good way to

Stories of woe from 
Rosarito Beach 

We are in the sixth week of 
spring quarter, a time I refer to 
annually as the dead ~riod. Most 
of us will be done With midterms 
by the end of this week and looking 
for something exciting to do. 

Unfortunately, the patron saint 
of entertainment days is not for 
another week and a half. People 
from all walks of life and majors are 
'ho1ding out for the Sun God 
Festival (even my sister in Orange 
County is counting the days until 
she comes down to visit her big 
brother and experience her first 
Sun God). 

We are in an entertainment void 
for the next week, a void deep 
enough to make the lure of Mexico 
look like an appealing choice. 
Although I certainly have nothing 
against an occasional trip to visit 
our neighbors to the south, let me 
tell you a story that may make you 
reconsider your choice in excur-
sions. 

Since the end of my freshman 
year. my friends and I have always 
chosen a two-day visit to Rosarito 
over a one-night trip to Tijuana. 
Our last trip to this jewel of a 
meU'opolis was certainly our most 
interesting. 

We arrived at the border at 
about 9:30 p.m. We were as eager 
as schoolchildren on Christmas 
Eve when we walked through the 
turnstile separating the world 's 
greatest economy from a country 
whose chief exports are fireworks 
and switchblades. After negotiating 
our price. we hopped in a cab and 
we were on our 25-mile voyage 
deep into the bowels of Baja 
California. 

Our first complication occurred 
when my roommate decided to stiff 
the taxi driver three bucks when he 
paid. My other friends and I walked 
off, not knowing what had taken 
place. when the cab driver came 
driving down the wrong side of the 
street yelling at us in Spanish. I did 
what any scared American would 
do in that situation - I ran away 
screaming like a woman. My room-
mate. obviously awan: of what was 
happening, stopped and paid the 
extra three dollars that we owed the 
man for performing his service, and 
the crisis was averted. 

After we gave my roommate a 
thorough beating for his incompe-
tence. we moved on to the hotel. 
where we secured a room without a 
hitch. After consuming large 
amounts of alcohol in the room. we 
moved on to Papas and Beer for a 
night of dancing. 

After a few hours of buying 
exorbitantly priced drinks and 
dancing with complete strangers, I 
went back to the hotel room to go 
to bed. 1\vo of my friends were 
there, but one was still absent. After 
an hour of tossing and turning in 
the bed, I realized that my friend 
was still not in the room. 

I put my shoes on to go look for 
him and just as I was about to leave 
the room. he walked in with puke 
all over his shirt, bruises on his 
arms and a big grin on his face. 

His story was that he was too 
drunk to find our room. so he tried 
to pass out on the street. After 
being beaten by the Federales, he 
moved on to the lobby of another

Softball Swept By Chapman 
Two losses to Chapman 
University will hurt 
UCSD's No.3 ranking 
., IIOaIIT FUUON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team hit a road 
block in wrapping up its regular season 
Saturday. 

Chapman University, the 10th-ranked 
Division III team in the nation, got the 
best of the third-ranked Tritons, downing 
them 4-2 and 5-1 in two games. 

MWe played a good game: Triton Erin 
Bridges said. "Unfortunately we lost: 

The first game looked promising for 
the home team after UCSD grabbed a 2-
o lead. 

In the third inning, Kristin Hunstad 
reached base on an infield single and 
moved to second after a Samantha Hayes 
sacrifice. 

With one out and a runner on second, 
Michelle Wilson came to the plate. 
Wilson launched a single just fair down 
the right field line, driving in Hunstad, 
making the score 1-0. 

UCSD added another run in the bot-
tom of the sixth . 

With two outs, Kristina Anderson 
ripped a triple to center field in a play that 
knocked the outfield fence over. 

UCSD's Leea Harlan came to the plate 
looking to drive in Anderson. Harlan hit a 
grounder back to Panther pitcher TIffilny 
Hoskins. In what should have been an 
easy out, Hoskins botched the throw to 
first. Harlan was safe, Anderson scored 
and UCSD was up 2-0. 

The Tritons wen:' feeling confident 
with the 2-0 lead. Harlan, who struck out 
five and allowed four hits the entire game, 
was commanding the mound, and the 
defense was performing strong behind 
her. 

In the seventh. all that changed. 
Chapman used two hits to capitalize 

on two Triton errors, scoring four runs to 
take a 4-2 lead. UCSD couldn't recover in 
its half of the inning and UCSD took the 
loss. 

The momentum the Panthers gar-
nered in the end of the first game carried 
over into the second. 

"There may have been a momentum 
swing," Triton Head Coach Patti 
Gcrckens said. MWe were up for game 
two. Disappointed, but up for it:

C •• ILIIIIII: KristinaAndmon smacks a baU into the air in a game tarlitr this season. Andmon has been the

With the usually very capable Erin 
Flannigan on the mound, Chapman 
began the second contest with a barrage 
of runs, opening the game with a 4-0 
lead. 

UCSD tried to come back. 
In the bottom of the first inning, Hayes singled 

and eventually scored off two Chapman errors, 
making the game 4-1. 

game, was a workhorse all afternoon, tossing six 
and one third innings in the second game. 

"Harlan did a great job and they have great hit-
ters," Gerckens said. "She did a great job in keep-
ing them off balance." 

MThey're very good hitters: Gerckens 
said. "They were on her." 

That would be as close as UCSD would get 
after the Panthers added another run. closing out 
the game, up 5-1 .

., TAlI' IIILUII 
Stllff Writer 

On a superb weekend for base-
ball, the Tritons hosted the annual 
UC San Diego Triton Classic. 
With their playoff hopes up in the 
air, the Tritons had little to lose 
and came out and played strong 
baseball. winning their four games 
by a combined score of 33-14. 

The Tritons first took the field 
against Chapman University on 
Saturday in a high noon show-
down. Aim' being embarrassed 
22-1 last week by Chapman in the 
first game of a double header at 
Orange, UCSD came OUt with a 
vengeance. 

The Tritons sent 1 s' batters to 

the plate in the first inning, scor-
ing 11 runs. They blasted three 
triples and knocked Chapman 
starting pitcher Andrew Tisdale 
from the mound after he had faced 
nine batters and recorded no outs. 

The offensive explosion was 
welcomed by the very partisan 
crowd. Many of the fans there had 
sons in the game and it had been a 
while since they had seen UCSD 
unload like it did against 
Chapman. 

"After you see a team a couple 
of times, you get to know them," 
Assistant Coach Jeff Waymire said 
of the offensive surge. "We just did 
what needed to be done." 

Pitching for the Tritons was 
Andrew Holloway, who turned in 

a stellar performance. He pitched a 
complete game, never letting 
Chapman mount even the small-
est comeback. He allowed three 
runs on seven hits and two walks, 
while also recording seven strike-
outs. 

The Tritons added three more 
runs after the first inning. Todd 
Scherwin went 3-5 with four RBis 
and Desi Loessburg hit a triple in 
going 3-4 with two RBIs. The final 
score was a satisfying (at least for 
the Thtons) 14-3. 

The Tritons played their sec-
ond game against Redlands, who 
had played its first game at 
Southwestern University. 

Because of the number of 
games that had to be played in the 

tournament, games were played 
on Triton Baseball Field and at 
Southwestern. 

In addition to Chapman, 
Redlands and UCSD, La Verne, 
Cal Lutheran and CSU Hayward 
also competed in the tournament. 
Each team played two games a day 
over the two-day tournament. 

Through the first five innings 
the game was knotted at 0-0, but in 
the sixth Tyler Sullivan created an 
opportunity for UCSD. He reached 
third base from some great 
baserunning and an error by the 
Redlands defense. Then Chris 
Tallman, the Triton first baseman, 
lofted a sac fly to score the Triton's
