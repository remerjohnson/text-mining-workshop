Hands Across America 
planned for May 25 

On Sunday, May 25, as many 
as 6 million people will be 
linking together Hands Across 
America, a history-making event 
which will directly help the 
hungry and homeless in America. 

Included in the human line 
stretching from Los Angeles to 

ew York will be college students 
from all over the United States, 
including many from UCSD. 
ACE, the Association of 
Collegiate Entrepreneurs, will be 
going up to the Palm Springs 
area along With several other 
groups on campus, including 
Third College's "L" apartment. 

ACE President Van 
Hutchinson remarked, "I can't 
think of a more meaningful way 
to actually do something positive 
about hunger." 

The San Diego Chapter of 
SHARE is providing 
transporuHlon to the Arizona 
desert on Sunday at 6 am, 
returning that evening as part of 
SHARE's efforts to encourge 
students to paltlcipate in the 
event. 

-There are quite a few sports 
open, but the largest need seems 
to be in Blythe, Arizona," said 
Peter Meisen of SHARE. 

The cost is $35, including the 
$10 donation fee and 
transportation. 

To register for Hands Across 
America, a ticket must be 
purchased through Ticketmaster. 

Atkinson's satellite 
dish request approved 

Last Thursday, the California 
Coastal Commission had a 
request by UCSD Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson to instaU a 
satellite dish , 10 feet in 

BLOOM COUNTY 

In diameter, in his backyard. 
Although Atkinson's home IS 

owned by the University of 
California system, he says that 

he will pay for the dish With his 
"own private funding sources." 

None of Atkinson's neighbors 
attended the CCCs meeting to 
oppose the Chancellor's request. 

Commission approval was 
necessary for the satellite dish 
because the house is within the 
coastal zone .

and essayist for Time magazine,

UCSB AS President 
drunk in public 

(UCW) Campus police 
arrested UCSB's AS President 
Doug Yates shortly after 11 pm 
Thursday, May 8, when a UC 
Pub manager called officers to 
quell a disturbance. 

Yates was booked at Santa 

Barbra County Jail after officers 
observed that he was publicly 
intoxicated. "He couldn't look 
out for himsclC" said Margaret 
Weeks, UCSB's director of public 
information. Yates was also 
charged with malicious mischief 
for allegedly damaging a 
restroom soap dispenser. 

After getting ki ked out once, 
Yates climbed down to the 
drinking area from a railing, 
swinging on rafters that support 
the lounge above the Pub, 
according to a witness. 

At one point in the evening, 
UC B senior Greg Koppel said 
he saw Pub employees ask Yates 

-to leave , and when he refused. 
they called the police. 

When the officers arrived "he 
got on his knees and begged to 
be arrested ," said Koppel. 

Yates was released on a 
citation shortly after 5 pm Friday 
afternoon. 

Census shows wives are 
growing as breadwinner 

In families where both spouses 
work, nearly one wife in five 
earns more than her huband, the 
Census Bureau reported last 
week. 

That situation involves almost 
5 million women and occurs 
most often in the 25-34 age 
group the report foynd . 
The share gradua~eclines with 
age. 

Delayed childbearing by 
women pursuing education and 
careers is likely to be at least 
partly responsible for this age 
difference, said Robert W. 
Cleveland of the Census Bureau. 

"Wives earning more than 
their husbands were more likely 
to be working year-round, full-
time to have no minor children 
at home, have completed college 
and work in professional 
specialty occupations or 
executive, administrative or 
managerial occupations," said the 
repoll by Cleveland and Mary F. 
Henson of the Census Bureau's 
Population Division.

Noise complaints kill concerts 
By CHERYL CARTWRIGHT. Siaff Writer 

D UE TO numerous noise ~omplaims, the free outdoor noon concerts, programmed by 
the Associated Students, have bcen 
moved to the Pub. according to Joel 
Schanchne, newly elected AS 
Commissioner of Programming. 

The bands will now play in the Pub 
on Thursdays from 5 to 6 pm instead of 
at the gym steps on Wednesdays , in 
order to avoid disturbing administrators 
in the Chancellors' Complex, professors 
in Mandeville and H&SS and lab 
personnel in Bonner Hall. 

"Noise is something that you cannot 
hide in outdoor programming," Randon 
Woodard, AS adviser said . "But 
something has to go on several times a 
week for commuter stud ems who have 
an hour or two to sparc in bctween 
classes in which they cannot go home 
like the students living in the 
dormitories can," he added. 

Wimer quarter, a band played every 
Thursday on the gym steps. Groups 
were scheduled and played up until May 
1 this quarter. with an option to renew. 
Complaints began with 15 to 20 
minutes into the performances. Music 
rehearsals in the practice rooms of 
Mandeville were disturbed by the rock 
and roll, as was an event in the Pacific 
Ring Festival. 

"I am not here to babysit nor to be 
interrupted. This sc hool is yours artd 
mine. We must work together, and some 
students can nOt disturb Others," 
Professor Bert TureLZky of the music 
depanment said . "Why do they need a 
rock concert in the middle of the week, 
in the middle of the day? I don't see 
anything to celebrate; on Fridays - at 
the TGIFs - sure , because you have 
JUSt completed another difficuft week," 

he added. 
People have always been concerned 

about outdoor concert noise since the 
TGs began many years ago. Due to noisc 
complaims, the TGs were moved from 
various sites around campus in an 
attempt to find a location which would 
disturb the fewest people. Originally, 
TGs began at 3 pm and started 
progressively later until now when TGs 
begin about 4:30 pm. 

"Less noiSY outdoor entcrtainment is 
being conSidered," Schachne said. 
·Comediennes. dance troupes and other 
;(ltematives may be held on the gym 
steps in the future ," he added. 

KSDT, the campus radio station, used 
to amplify music on the hump. but now 
the music is limited to between noon 
and 1 pm and between 5 pm and 1 am. 
The outdoor music is turned 01I when 
there is an event at the Grove Gallery. 

With concerts held at the gym steps, 
sound waves bounce 01I the windows of 
the gym and the ,hump then speed up 
and amplify as they travel around the 
Student Center down to the 
Administration Complex. Bands on Muir 
field are said to disturb the homes in La 
Jolla Farms. 

"At UCSD there is no outdoor faciliry 
isolated enough for concerts without 
impacting offices and classrooms," 
Woodard said . "Rock 'n roll can be 
very disruptive because of high and 10"'; 
tones." 

"The rock bands have been almost 
like having a radio in the office on full 
blast," Kerry Nare, supervisor for fiscal 
unit in the biology depanment said of 
her office on the second floor of Bonner 
Hall. 

"The noise from the Sun God Festival 
was so loud that we had to close our

Atrocious ticketing 

Editor: 
T oday's fairl y liberal society is 

often guilty of nOt prosecuting 
every "criminal" for every 
viola tion of the law that occurs, 
with malice or otherwise . In the 
law enforcement business this is 
known as enforCing the "spirit of 
the law" rather than the "letter of 
the law." However, there is one 
aspect of traffic control that has 
not incorporated this 
philosophy: parking 
enforcement. 

There are indications that 
there is a lot of wrongful 
ticketing going on. I personaly 
have been cited for not having a 
service yard pass when I was not 
even in a service yard , as well as 
for other minor d iscrepancies in 
the interpretation of the law. 

The average parking citation is 
unique in its automatic 
assumption of your guilt. There 
is a provision fo r a very time 
consuming trial process hidden 

in the fine prim on the reverse , 
but most people would rather 
admit their guilt and pay the $20 
fine than fight the deliberately 
intimidating bureauc racy in 
order to prove their innocence. 
After beIng cited, whether justly 
or not , you are committed to lose 
something, somehow. 

Therefore It IS necessary to 
make every effort to stop these 
atrocities. you can simply plead 
"not guilty to every offense In a 
coun and request a jury trial with 
an appearance of the issuing 
officer. If you plan to sell your 
car in the next year, don 't worry 
about it. The buyer win have to 
pay the fines , but the only way 
the DMV can get you is by 
holding registration on your car. 

One final note : There are a 
few things I detest more than 
finding a yuppie blocking my 
only way after a midterm - or 
someone who has decided to 
park blocking traffic on a small 
S{reet in order to get a Coke . Of 
course , it is people like this that 
parking cites and parking 
officers were meant for - and 

that should continue. 
Matt Smiley 

Making up facts 
Editor: 

From his letter of May 12 in 
rhe Guardian, it would appear 
that Nidhal Guessoum subscribes 
to the view that "if you don't like 
the facts , make up some of your 
own." Despite h is assenions, 
Vomer did not visit Israel in 
1974, and there is absolutely no 
evidence that Israel has prdvided 
any nuclear assistance to South 
Africa. Similarly, no amount of 
propoganda will alter the fact 
the Britain and France are 
South Africa's major arms 
suppliers, and nOl Israel. The 
apartheid regime has sought to 
create the impression of close 
links with Israel in order to gain 
intemalionallegitimacy, but, in 
fact, no "community of interests" 
exists. The real supporters of 
apartheid are the Arab oil 
producers.

Closing the house 

Our weeks will be shy of yet another form of on-
campus entertainment. As the faculty has complained of 
"too much noise ," we no longer have the opportunity ~o 
enjoy noontime concerts in the middle of our heCtIc 
academic weeks .. We aU suffer from ovelWork, yet this 
campus continues to close itself to non-academic 
endeavors. 

With the end of noontime concerts, the dearth of 
social activity on this campus is again striking us in the 
face. Over the years, it has become clear what place 
student wishes take in administrative planning. Our 
station is that of a captive and obedient audience not 
that of an integral part of the university which gives and 
receives of benefits. We are a gray mass of bodies that 
researchers must acknowledge in order to earn their 
grants and fellowships . 

This institution is forever fighting to obtain the 
elusive and questionably worthy status of an Ivy-class 
university, and we are forgetting the ultimate purpose of 
education in the process. We have given too much 
importance to our reputation as a serious and difficult 
intellectual center. We have made this campus into a 
place where theorists reign, and panicipants are few 
and disappearing. Something must change. 

Ostensibly, the meaning of education is to mold well-
rounded, citizens. All tOo often, we forget that the 
university is a community within a larger society. We 
must learn here how we will think and to what purpose 
we will dedicate ourselves, and we must begin to decide 
how we will balance our lives. To organize ourselves 
ultimately according to our academics is to lose the 
ability to integr.ate our thinking back into society. 

It just doesn't make sense. This campus is in dire 
need of activities to unite the student body as a whole. 
We're constantly searching for ways to cultivate schoo! 
spirit and unity. Nevertheless, we are cutting an activity 
which served to bring together students from the 
various colleges. 

Our academic careers are already difficult and 
consuming. It is a challenge for every student to 
maintain healthy relationships with others in this 
environment. In order to succeed here , we are already 
often forced to deny our social interests. To exclude 
opportunities for entertainment relegates us to roles as 
single-minded individuals. L F h

Letting the people know-fighting the O.S.A. 
By KATHY BECKETI. Contributing Opinions Editor 
"I NFoIiMAnoN is not a • the Office of Budget and 

public good, but is a Management has dismantled 
resource of substantial those agencies tha t function to 

economic value and should be collect and disseminate 
treated as such." This statement, information. Priva te corporations 
made by a high-ranking State (which are representative of 
Department official, exemplifies private interests) are assuming 
the elitist and paternalistic this responsibility by offering 
approach toward the much-needed funding to 
dissemination of information researchers and academics that, 
that is characteristic of the by virtue of an absence of 
Reagan Administration . Under government support, are in no 
the auspices of "security" or pOSition to refuse. In this 
"cost-effectiveness," private manner, private interests are 
ownership of information , gaining control of what should 
restrictions o n the Freedom of be public information. The 
Information Act and limits on private and profit-seeking nature 
freedom of the press are of these organizations precludes 
reaching epic proportions. The public access to the facts which 
public's "right to know" has been have become highly valuable and 
pitted against the gove rnment's marketable commodity. The 
right [0 censor, and the latter is privilege of access is now JUSt 
winning the battle - hands that - privilege - reserved for 
down. those who are able and willing to 

As part of the effon to alleviate pay, and whose interests are 
the government of its traditional juxtaposed to the interests of the 
responsibility for public welfare, public . 

Since the arriva l ot the Reagan 
Administration at the White 
House in 1981 , 51 executive 
actions have been taken to 
restrict access [0 information and 
freedom of the press. Restrictions 
on the Freedom of Information 
Act formerly affected only that 
information that would threaten 
U.S. security or pose a risk to the 
government or a third pany. This 
restiriction has been broadened 
to include any information 
regarding foreign affairs and 
other information that would 
pose no threat to either of the 
panies mentioned above. One of 
these acts, "the Official Secrets 
Act," reverses broad sections o f 
the FOIA dealing with access to 
information on law enforcement, 
organized crime and health and 
consumer problems. It is obvious 
that this information could not 
conceivably threaten U.S. 
security, a,nd the effort to conceal 
it is an attempt to preclude 

criticism of the administration 
and its inability to deal 
effectively with these problems. 

"You can't let the people know 
what the government is doing 
without letting the wrong people 
know - those who are in 
opposition to what you a re 
doing." This statement was made 
by President Reagan following 
the U.S. invasion of Grenada. 
During the invasion , all U.S. 
media were barred from the 
island. The administration 
justified abberation of the 
principles of freedom of 
info rmation and the people's 
right to know in the name of 
preventing those who might 
oppose the invasion from 
learning of it. It effectively 
reduced government 
accountability to nil, the already 
seldom-performed role of the 
press as a "watchdog" was 
rendered impossible. Both of 
these effects are in direct 

oppOSition to the spirit of 
democracy which posits the 
responsibility for decision-
making in the public and 
guarantees that the basis for 
these decisions shall be free and 
uncensored informati,on. 

Fascism is unsurpassed in its 
ability to maintain a Hctitious , 
world through consistent lying. . 
The maintenance of this illusion 
necessitates control of 
communication, as the restrictior 
of information prevents the 
public from challenging the 
inte rpretations that are given to 
them by the government. 

Without uncensored information 
that serves as the anchor to 
reality. the basis for loyalty to 
government is manipulation. 
ignorance and deceit. Restricted 
access to information is leading 
this nation down a path from 
which there may be no 
return. 1m

it was necessary to find which day of

disruption . After some research, the 
noon hour on Thursdays was found to 
cause the least classroom and ollice

However, the first Thursday afternoon 
that the AS bands played in the Pub, an 
older person complained about the 
volume of the music. The sound was 
adjusted according to Maryanne Davis, 
owner of the Pub. 

Bands reponedly are not held in the 
Pub during the lunch hour because 
people can't hear their numbers called 
when food orders are ready and thus do 
not want to eat to loud music. 

Unexpectedly, not many people were 
at the Pub when AS programs were

scheduled. "When we first opened, we 
had to cancel a few of the acts that we 
had scheduled in the middle of the 
day," Davis said . "The Pub is not very 
g60d for sound, but it is better now with 
the- open windows," she added. 

"We try to help the students 
whenever we can. We want to be Ii pan 
of their lives. However, we do have one 
stipulation - no punk music, because 
we have had bad experiences with it," 
Davis continued. 

Most of the bands engaged by the 
Associated Students do not charge

because they want exposure. The band 
Dorian Grey played this Thursday in the 
Pub at no charge [0 about 20 swdents. 

Despite measures taken to control the 
noise problem anributable to outdoor 
concerts, a resolution does nO[ seem 
close at hand. According to Woodard , 
"To accomodate the increasing the 
number of students, classes will have to 
start earlier and end later. There will 
have to be classes until 7 pm until more 
classrooms are built. Therefore , there 
will always be impact on classes from 
outdoor programming." ~

The papers include 
manuscripts and letters sent to 
Oppen and published and 
unpublished poetry. There is a 
letter from Oppen to Charles 
Reznikoff and other letters that 
William Carlos Williams and 
PoetJohn Taggar wrote to 
Oppen. A reaDy interesting 
exhibit included various poems 
which had been pasted together; 
Oppen apparently never 
abandoned his first thought. and 
was labeled "undeniably messy 
and careless." 

Oppen. an objectivist poet. 
was part of a group of writers 
which formed during the early 
1930s and included William 
Carlos Williams. Charles 
Reznikoff, Louis Zukofsky and 
Carl Rakosi. George Oppen 
worked as a political activist in 
New York State and later served 
in World War II as a private in 
the U.S. Army. He moved his 
family to Mexico City, due to his 
political affiliations. where he 
remained until 1959 during the 
McCarthy Era. 

Oppen wrote his first book 
Discre/e Series. published in 1934. 
with an introducton by Ezra 
Pound . His fourth book. Of Being 
Numerous . won the Pulitzer Prize 
for Poetry in 1969. 

A two-day symposium on the 
life and work of the poet was 
held last week. The symposium, 
called "The Pleasure of Being 
Heard ." was held in conjunction 
with UCSD's 25th anniversary 
celebration. The rwo-day 
conference organized by UCSO's 

ManUSCripts and letters of the late 
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and author 
George Oppen (left) are on display in 
the Archive for New Poetry.

and poetS Rachel Blau DuPlessis 
and Stephen Rodefer read some 
of their works. Rachel BIau 
DuPlessin was close with the 
Oppen family ·and remarked that

poet. Stephen Rodefor. curator of

Che Ca(e 

By JON PREIMESBERGER 

T HE CORONADO Bridge 10K was to be the last race of 1984, and I set out, 1 
admit rather underhandedly, to 
finally vanqUish my personal 
nemesis, my ego-tormentor, the 
guy who had beaten me in six or 
seven previous races, my best 
friend Dan. 

That October he had beaten 
me badly by twO minutes in the 
5trohs Libenv 8K. His girlfriend 
and two sisters had come down 
from LA to watch, and with 
such incemive, I claimed he had 
unfair advantage. So, I plotted 
patiently for the Coronado 
Bridge. 

Dan had been a minor high-
school cross-country star, but his 
natural running ability had fallen 
with disuse . Although I had 
greater shon distance speed (I 
had actually beaten him once in 
a spontaneous sprint to the top 
of a San Francisco hill), I knew I 
could only win a race of 6.2 
miles by a superior show of 
mental strategy. 

I lied through my smiling 
teeth . During the month prior to 
the race whenever we got 
together or when he called from 
San Diego State , he would always 
ask the inevitable, "Hey, have 
you been running?" I would 
laug\'> h"r~, "Are you kidding?" 
and n, ... dtion something about 

drinking beer at the Pub to quell 
his competitive curiosity. 

I was working out with a 
passion. I ran at least five miles 
every other day and I made daily 
trips to the weight room. Since 
the race included the 400-foot 
Coronado Bridge, I also ran hills. 
I ran Genesee to Clairemom 
Mesa and back. 1 ran from UCSD 
up and down the fireroad to 
Black's. On weekends I took 30-
mile bike rides. Rocky would 
have been proud. 

to be completely ruthless, I 
let it slip out a week before the 
race that, I had been running, 
"just a little, with Michelle," 
adding, "on the beach." Michelle 
was a mutual friend who was to 
run with us, and in berween my 
heavy workouts, I jogged twO to 
four miles with her on La Jolla 
Shores. My conscience was 
totally eased when Dan ran once 
or twice himself. 

Bdore the race, instead of my 
usual taunts and projections of 
victory, I was introspective with 
the realization that the race was

not just between him and me, 
but somehow Michelle , toO, was 
riding on the outcome of it. 

I starred with ' the gun very 
fast, leaving Dan behind, 
speeding up the bridge dodging 
the slower runners. Seven 
minutes later, I confidently 
passed the first mile with 
thousands of runners and Dan 
safely behind me, so I thought. 

As the bridge sloped 
downward , I was surprised to 
find Dan alongside. We both 

swore about the slower runners 
who had placed themselves like 
obstacles in the front of the 
pack. Then, without a word, he 
picked up his speed and left me 
behind. I tried to keep up, but 
the pace was too great. I watched 
his yellow shin disa,ppear into 
the river of runners ahead. My 
dreams were in ruins. 

Disheartened, I let gravity pull 
me down through second mile , 
but, while making the rum off 
the bridge, fate smiled as 
inspiration flashed by. A young

SUMMER SPECIAL 
10-15% DISCOVrrr 

A eulogy for 
SDSU Crew 
By KAREN KUMM 

O N THE NIGHT of Sunday, May 11 , a van carrying 1) young athletes from San Diego State University crashed, killing three people. That very same evening I was in a 
van, with fellow members of UCSD Crew, following the same route 
on 1-5 from Sacramento to San Diego. We were lucky. Ouivan did 
not crash. Except for this fact, our situation was strikingly similar to 
theirs. We were on our way home from the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships, the final event of the season. Our mode of 
transponation for the weekend was rented school vans. Ten of us 
were rravelling in my van. Our mood was high-spirited; the long, 
hard months of training were finally over. We had done fai rly.well 
in our races, we were psyched up for the drive home. After all the 
hours put into crew, we had developed a close camaraderie. The 
drive would be long, but enjoyable. 

We left Sacramento at about 6 om. after refilling the gas tank and 
stocking up on food for the trip. The two varsity vans caravanned for 
most of the way home, d riving together lest anything should 
happen. Fortunately for our rwo vans, the drive was uneventful and 
we all arrived home in the wee hours of the morning. 

Monday morning the news hit. There had been an accident 
involving San Diego State's Crew Team, killing three people. There 
was one girl travelling in the van with State's crew. There were 
conflicting reports about which school she was from - USD or 
UCSD. My first reaction was shock that fe llow rowers had been 
ki lled. When it was confirmed that no one from UCSD had been 
involved, I was relieved . I felt sickened though, because the SDSU 
Crew Team is like our brother team. We use the same boathouse 
facilities , row side by side on Mission Bay, day after day. What 
happened to them could have happened to us. I can't imagine it. It 
is terrible to even tty to think how I would have felt if some people 
on our team were ki lled. The relief I felt that none of us had been 
involved soon faded I was left with the real!ty of what happened. 
Ho urs prior to the accident, at the race course, we had all been , 
joyously celebrating the end to a grueling season. It is not fair for 
young, victorius athletes to die like that; they were so undeserving 
of such a rragic fate. 

Along with the impossibility of imagining what the unfonunate 
people involved with the accident must be going through, I cannot 
SlOp thinking how it could so easily have been our team in that 
crash. Almost every circumstance of their situation was identical to 
ours. Every UCSD rower has undergone extreme emotional turmoil 
since the accident. Our road trips will never be quite the same. We 
can only take more precautionary measures from now on, and 
when we row alongside the San Diego State team, we can admire the 
strength they have 10 carry on. Ii:iJ
