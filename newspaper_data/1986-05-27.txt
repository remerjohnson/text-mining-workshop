paint cans were in the trash . It is 
not illegal to dump paint cans 
into trash receptacles, but it is 
illegal to incinerate paint cans. 

As the trash was loaded onto 
the truck, friction may have 
broken the bottles and the 
chemicals may have become 
exposed to oxygen and started to 
bum freely, Scott Wilson , a 
university safety officer, 
suggested . The fire wa taken to 
2800 Torrey Pines Scenic Road, 
better known as the Glider Port. 

San Diego firepersons did not 
put the fire out with water, but 
allowed it to bum itself out since 
the chemicals may have been 
toxic and would have seeped 
into the ground. 

"We did not know the subject 
or quantity of unknown dumped, 
so we just assumed the worst 
and let it bum," Captain Russell 
Palmer, station head of Division 
C of the Fire Department, said . 
"We took the safety approach," 
he added. 

The second fire occurred 
Friday, March 28 from 8:42 am 
to 12:45 pm in a trash truck 
containing materials from a 
lesraurant and Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography. Again , the fire 
was transported to the Glider 
POrt, although most of the 
chemIcals burnt off in the first 
hour. The firefighters then felt 
comfortable putting out the rest 
of the nre , which consisted 
mostly of trash , by using water, 
according to Larry Cooke, deputy 
community education officer 
with the Fire Department. 

The cause of the fire was 
undetermined. Usually It is 
difficult to determine where the 
burning garbage in the truck 
came from since the trash is 
collected from many different 
places. 

Trash picked up from UC D 
is uppo ed to be only clerical 
refuse, not chemicals. 

When such chemIcal fires do 
erupt, they are transported to the 
Glider Port because that location 
is convenient , and life and 
property will not be endangered 
there. With a two-way radio, the

AIDS study reveals 
heterosexual threat 

A study showing a single act 
of vaginal, heterosexual 
intercourse can spread the AIDS 
virus suggests non-homosexuals 
should avoid risky sex practices 
if they have more than one 
partner, doctors said this week. 

"That's an extremely importam 
fi ndi ng. It tells people that the 
risk of spread of the virus exists 
in any single sexual contact" 
between a man and woman 
engaging in vaginal intercourse, 
said Dr. eil Schran, chairman of 
the Los Angeles City-County 
AIDS Task Force. 

"Low-risk sexual behavior is 
necessary all the time if people 
are not in a mutually 
monogamous relationship," he 
added . Low-risk sex involves 
avoiding the exchange of blood 
or semen, such as by using 
condoms during laginal 
intercourse and avoiding oral 
and anal sex. 

Schran based his comments 
on an ongoing study conducted 
by Dr. Tom Peterman, a medical 
epidemiologist at the National 
Center for Disease Control in 
Atlanta. 

The study involves 
heterosexual men and women 
who caught acquired immune 
defiCiency syndrome from 
contaminated blood transfusions, 
and the sexual partners of those 
AIDS patients. The study IS 
intended to i etermine that rate 
at which tht: AIDS virus is spread 
from women to men during 
vaginal intercourse.

UCSD's Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, has been selected 
to receive an honorary doctor of 
science degree from the 
University of Cambridge, 
England. 

Professor Munk will have the 
degree conferred at a cermony at 
Cambridge UniverSity on 
Thursday, June 12, by the 
university'S chancellor, H.RH. 
The Duke of Edi nburgh. The 
degree recognizes Professor 
Munk's many contributions in 
studies of the deep interior of 
the earth and the physics of the 
oceans. 

Professor Munk has a wide 
range of scientific imerests and 
has published more than 200 
papers on subjects as diverse as 
the internal waves of the oceans, 
variations in sea level , tsunamis 
and the rotation of the earth. He 
has often been honored for his 
research, including being elected 
to the ational Academy of 
Scien e in 1956 and selection for 
the National Medal of Science 
from President Reagan in 1985. 

Munk is a pioneer in using 
computers and other 
sophisticated instruments in 
geophysics and ocenography and 
was among the fIrst 'ntists to 
use scuba gear in inv ingations. 
His recent research ha. focused 
on the use of sound to 
investigate details of the interior 
of tl'- ~ean, a method called 
ocean acoustic tomography. 

Bill aims to educate on 
nuclear issues 

The state's pubtic schools 
would be required to incorporate 
nuclear age education into their 
curriculum under a bill approved 
Wednesday by the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee. 

The bill's author and 
committee chairman 

Assemblyman John Vasconcello 
said the measure is the "direct" 
result of a study onducted last 
year by the state Department of 
Education on the nuclear age 
issue . AB 3285 follows the 
recommendtions made by the 
department. 

The study concluded that 
currently there IS little instruction 
and inadequate teacher 
preparation on the issue. 

The department's report also 
concluded that students' lack of 
motivation - in and out of 
school - is a direct result of 
their fear of a prospective 
nuclear war. 

According to some polls, a 
majority of high school students 
believe that nuclear war is 
inevitable in the next decade, 
the study reponed . 

The Department of Education 
report concluded that it is the 
responsibility of public schools 
to prepare students to 
understand "the facts of life in 
the nuclear age , the threat of 
nuclear war and annih ilation and 
the dangers of radiation." 

The bill would authorize the 
Superintendent of Public 
Instruction to contract with a 
public or private college or 
university to admInister the 
Nuclear Age Studies Project The 
UniverSity of California is a 
leading candidate for such a 
contract.

official mascot 

The banana slug is now the 
official mascot of the UniverSity 
of California, Santa Cruz. 
Chancellor Robert Seinsheimer 
reluctantly bowed to 
overwhelming student body 
demand after a majority of the 
school's athletes said they would 
rather be known as Slugs than 
Sea Lions. Seinsheimer said the 
new nickname would stand 
"until such occasion as the 
students migh t wish to hold 
another election." He suggested, 
however, that university 
biologists begin a program of 
genetic research upon the slug to 
improve the breed .

AS responds to mismanagement charges 
By EMMA-LEE CAPRIO, Staff Writer 

T HE ASSOClATED Students' "The student organizations government has and media need 10th week for responded to new repeals to be fa ir to them ," Riley 
indicator ch arges of election said . 
mismanagement in an open 
letter and peti tion to Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson, saying the 
collective prohibited regular 
governme nt operation by 
persistent filing of elections 
violations this quarter. 

The lette r, written by John 
Riley, the newly elected AS 
President, states that UCSD 
students suppon the results of 

• th~ ~ AS elections and 
"recognize that the violations 
filed by members of the new 
indicator collective a re nothing 
but fruitless attacks of a small 
minority that are endangering 
the rights of a large majority of 

students.~ 
The new indicator collective has 

been filing violations and 
. sending letters about the 

elections and the AS constitution 
to Vice Chancellor JQSeph 
WatsQn and Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, throughout the quarter, 
Rilev said. 

Those who filed the charges 
were non-students , he added. 

"Non-students are trying to tell 
students what is the right fonn 
of government," Riley said . 

If the new AS officers take 
over ninth week, then an official 
fi nancial committee will have to 
rush on budget considerations, 
especially regarding student 
organizaitons and media budget 
requests, Riley sa id. 

There are numerous fallacies 
in the AS .open letter to the 
chancellor, Ed Swain, a member 
of the Coalition for a Free South 
Africa, and the student who filed 
the most recent violation against 
the AS elections commission,

Economic quicksand 
Editor: 

Deep in the hearts, virtually 
every thinking American knows 
Ronald Reagan's deposed Budget 
Director David Stockman, and 
Democratic presidential . 
candidate Walter Mondale were 
right A massive tax increase is 
necessary. 

Indeed , even the president's 
more knowledgeable handlers 
knew it, though they steadfastly 
refuse to admit that in Reagan'~ 
presence, which explains why 
the White House doesn't have its 
conscience - David Stockman 
- to kick around any longer. 

Incredibly, all the tax reform 
measures proposed to date , 
including the one so 
enthusiastically embraced by the 
bi-partisan Senate Finance 
Committee in May are "revenue 
neutral ," meaning they won't 
significantly raise government 
revenues one iota but merely will 
spread the tax obligatlon around 
a little more . In that sense , it's a 
placebo In place of a more 
drastic response - say, a frontal 
lobotomy. 

Still, under the great tax-cutler, 
Reagan has, in crfect , raised 
taxes among certain segments of 
Americans, by, Ironically , passing 
the increases along in the guise of 
tax cuts. The non-partisan 
CongreSSional Budget Office , for 
example, found that the net 
effect of spending and cuts 
resulted in a loss of $1 ,100 
between 1983 and 1984 for 
families earning less than 
$10,000 annually. Conversely, 
households earning more than 
$80,000 a year gained a 
whopping $24,260 during this 
same two-year period. 

Further, the medium Income 
of families in the bottom 40 
percent has plummeted $477 
from $12,966 in 1980 to $12,489 
in constant 1984 dollars. 
Meanwhile , the income of those 
in the highest 10 percent rose by 
$5,085, from $68.145 In 1980 to 
$73,230 in 1984. Thus, Reagan's 
great economic recovery hasn't 
tOuched most Americans. It is a 

myth. 
Bur it was by design, not 

coincidence, that the White 
House has relentlessly worked 
toward rewarding the well-heeled 
- . rypically Republicans - while 
simultaneously punishing the 
lower and lower-middle wage 
earners - frequently Democrats. 
Meanwhile, the middle classes -
whose numbers, incidently, are 
now rapidly diminishing -
baSically were able to keep their 
heads above economic 
quicksand. 

Now the president is insisting 
on accelerating this alarming 
trend by exempting the Defense 
Department from feeling the pain 
of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollins 
Balanced Budget Act; dropping 
the maximum income taX 
bracket from 50 to 27 percent , as 
the latest tax-reform measure 
calls for; and lowering the 
corporate tax rate from 46 to 33 
percent, despite the fact that the 
taxes big business pays are at 
their lowest rate in more than 
two decades. Guess on whose 
back the tax burden has been 
shifted? Remarkedly, in 1985 the 
Pentagon siphoned off $5,900 of 
every $10 ,000 in taxes collected. 
Reagan insists on awarding them 
$35 billion more in revenue than 
what Congress wants to allocate. 
Certainly the Pentagon can live 
with a $285 billion budget. 

Mondale and StOckman will 
ultimately have the last laull,h -
unfortunately, not at Reagan's . 
political expense, but at ours and 
our children's. 

Peter Quercia 

Crying Wolfe 
Editor. 

I'd like to call attention to twO 
events which occurred this week 
here at UCSD. The first is the 
cancellation of the AS noontime 
concert senes, and the second is 
the cancellation of Tom Wolfe's 
speaking engagement on May 22. 

Tom Wolfe's appearance was 
cancelled because he had 
apparently violated the 
exclusivity clause in his contract 
with UCSD. When Mr. Wolfe 
offered to drop his other 

speaking engagement in favor of 
UCSD, the university declined to 
renegotiate because, as Ms. 
Lynne Peterson (UEO director) 
put it, the university was no 
longer in the mood to play "Mr. 
Nice Guy."(Los Angeles Times, 
May 20). 

1 personally have not known 
the university to be Mr. Nice 
Guy! Both cancellations are 
unfortunate blunders which 
reflect and perpetuate negative 
images, whether the university 
realizes it or not, about UCSD 
and its internal community. 

The concert series was 
cancelled because of "numerous" 
complaints from the faculty about 
the excessive noise from bands 
playing on the gym steps. In 
regard to this cancellation , the 
image of UCSD as an "ivory 
tower" which putS its researeh 
and academic faculty's concerns 
first , and views the student 
concems as a bothersome 
necessity, is reaffirmed. 

Further, the Tom Wolfe 
incident projects an image of a 
cold and heartless institution 
that feels it doesn't have to play 
second fiddle to anyone , 
therefore Justifyi ng behavior 
which is irrational rather than 
diplomatiC. UCSD has one of the 
highest atrntion rates in the UC 
system, caused in part by a lack 
of social activities and disunity 
between bet)lleen the colleges. 

If more thought will be given to 
these problems as tlley arise. Not 
only will the univer9iry avoid 
robbing its students and the 
surrounding community of 
excellent UEO and AS events, 
but it will also avoid robbing 
itself of future students. '

Disclail11ing AS disinfo~ation 
Editor's nOLe: The following was 

submitted by ASUCSO PreSident 
Mary Rose Alexander and UCSO's 
judicial Board. 

What happened in the AS 
elections: 

Due to the fact that there has 
been a high level of confusion 
surrounding the events of the AS 
ElectIons, we feel it is necessary 
to report to you, the students of 
UCSD, the following facts : 
The general election of April 8 
and 9 , 1986 was declared 
invalid by the AS Election 
Commission, 

e The AS Election CommIssion 
is com posed of one 
representative from each College 
Council and one, non-voting 
Election Manager appOinted by 
the AS president and approved 
by the AS Council. The 
commIssion has the authority to 
invalidate an election in 
accordance with the AS Election 

Bylaws. 
e The commission chose to 

invalidate the election simply 
because it was discovered , 
during the election, that a 
number of students were unable 
to vote. 

e The voter eligibility list. 
supplied in its most recent form 
by the Registrar, was incomplete 
due to the Cashier's slowness in 
processing fees . Although this 
latency by the Cashier effected a 
random sampling <If the student 
body, it was realized after the 
election that, in fact, 10 percent 
of the campus was affected . 
Therefore , the election was 
declared invalid and rescheduled 
for April 29 and ;0, 1986. 
To ensure the facl thaI the April 
29 and 30 election would be 
fair, the Election Commission 
look the following ;lctions; 
•. A) The commission-r ' 
recommended to the AS Council 

that financial assitance of $200 
per slate or $50 per independent 
be given to all candidtes. The AS 
Council , therefore, paid for any 
candidate expenditure up to the 
designated level. Candidates 
were able to spend up to $600 
per slate or $125 per 
indepe ndent as stipulated in the 
Election Bylaws; however, they 
were strongly encourged to be 

. thrifty , In ract, many candidates 
did not even spe nd their full AS 
allotted account. 

B) One central polling place 
(the Gym Steps) was selected to 
upgrade the efficiency and 
fairness of the election . VOting 
hours were also extended . 

C) The commission 
scrupulously reviewed by the 
Election Bylaws to ensure that 
any pOSSIble management errors 
be avoided 
The April 29 and 30 election 
was held and a run-ofJ occurred 

Another camp-aign? 

Offsetting the cost 
of botched elections 

nie events surrounding this spring's elections 
demonstrate clearly the ways in which the rights of free 
democracy can be easily overlooked in favor of 
administrative Simplicity. Now, complaints from several 
factions of students lie on the desks of Chancellor 
Atkinson and Vice Chancellor Warson waiting to be 
acknowledged and answered. 

It is not the most comfortable or practical solution, but 
it is becoming clear that, on ethical grourtds, another AS 
election is necessal)', It would be easiest to brush under 
the rug the legal discrepancies which resulted during 
the springtime elections: Maybe none of the election 
results will be altered, but within the policies of this 
instinltion as it functions as a branch of the government, 
certain civil principles cannot be ignore.d. 

Our elections committee made an administrative 
oversight this spring which cost our candidates valuable 
campaign funds and hours. As little as the Associated 
Student Body wants to have itS limited funds used to' 
compensate for its councilors' administrative errors, yet 
are we responsible for the actions that the AS Council 
takes, and we must be sure that our entire electorate and 
the candidates for election are treated fairly al)d equally. 

The AS Council is not just accountable to the interests 
of the Associated Students. It is a governmental 
organization which should responsibly execute policies 
to favor the needs of the AS, but in canying out that task, 
it must adhere to principles of fair government. As our 
Council has erred in its administration , we , the 
Associated Students, are responsible for the damage it 
has caused. 

Inherently, actions taken by an organization 
democratically organized are the responsibility of those 
who have enacted it. By encouraging campaigning for a 
worthless election we (through our Elections 
Committee) have inju"red all of the candidates for 
election. 

Prior to the second elections all legal campaign 
expenditures should have been reimbursed through AS 
funding sources. Had they been, all candidates could 
have begun campaigning with equal resources. lnstead, 
the Council has wrongfully restricted access to office. 

The Associated Student Body's funds should Tlot be 
wasted continually on recall elections, but we must make 
reparations for -past injustices. We cannot go along 
cheerfully breaking the law and denying the rights of 
free democracy. 

on May 7, 1986, Throughout · 
the enli{e election process, 
violations, alleging 
mismanagement by the 
commission, were heard by the 
AS Judicial Board. In no case 
was the commission found 10 be 
guilty. 

eThe AS judic ial Board is 
composed of one representati ve 
from each CoBege Council and 
one chairperson appOinted by

by the AS Counci l. The board is 
authorized through th e AS 
constitution to interpret and 
uphold that document and its 
bylaws. 

e The board heard aU cases

student members of the new

eHad tile Judicial Board 

determined there to be 
mismanagement, the student 
petitioner in each case had 
requested that a new election 
(i.e., a third election) be held 
next fall and that all candidates 
(i.e ., approximately 75 students) 
become the AS in a cooperative 
situation to allocate the $500,000 
budget and to be the official 
student represe ntatives until 
furth er action occurs. This would 
reinstate the student cooperative 
government that was voted out 
by the students of UCSD in the 
late 1970s. At the time, the 
current AS govemment wa s

IN AND AROUND 

LA JOLLA 
The Junior Right 

Four years ago, a few students 
at UCSD concluded that the 
R.eagan- Revolution was not 
forcing enough change on 
campus. Thus, the California 
Review was created . 

If one ever takes the time to 
read the articles contained 
within the Review (apparently few 
do as wi messed by the 
untouched m,?unds of its copy 
eroding rapidly on library floors ), 
one thinks that it is a product of 
Jeny Falwell's remedial writing 
students. 

Filled with a plethora of a 
minefield of grammatical boo-
boo's, the reasonable individual 
on this campus normally 
dismisses th is joumal as silly 
dribble. 

As is common, the course of 
most of the litera te public when 
faced with a self-devouri ng, 
racist , sexist, elitist and jingoistic 
gr<?up of journalists, many of my 
peers thought that the best 
medicine for the Review enigma 
was to ignore it, and let it die a 
slow, grueling death of non-
recognition. 

Like many other joumals of its 
kind, the Review vowed that it 
wouldn't fold . With the Review's 
first issue, its editors (HW. 
Crocker and Eric Young) 
decided that they must show 
their true, debased colors to 
garner any publrc attention. 

The first example of this was 
three years ago, when the Review 
glorified the rape of a New 
Bedford, Massachussetts woman 
at the hands of eight drunken 
lunatics in front or'her cheering 
primates, The Review implied 

. that "justice was served" for the 
lustful men. 

After the Review aggrandized 
that melee, the students voted to 
kick the Review off campus, and 
to refuse to allocate student 
monies to fund that joumal. 

The editors of the Review were 
forced to bring in the ave nging 
lawyers of the New Right to 
pressure the UCSD 
administration into granting 
them office space in the Student 
Center last year. 

One might have believed that 
the Review editors would have

been sensible enough to relieve 
thems.elves of their destructive 
public attention schemes and 
gonen on with the business of 
writing truthful sentences, but 
they did not 

Some of its unfounded 
accusations have been: branding 
Latin American expert Wayne 
Cornelius as a communist; e.G. 
Abrio's plagiarization of Richard 
Nixon's idiocies in Southeast 
Asia; Kevin Phillip's wrious racist 
statements about how blacks in 
the US and Africa are incapable 
of goveming themselves; Alfred 
Cuzan's unprofessional, anti-

~istorical and misleading pleas 
In support of rightist oligarchies 
in Central America; and the 
unforgettable demands by the 
Spounias brothers and Barry 
Demuth to quarantine and attack 
homosexuals. 

The. poster contained in the 
April issue of the California 
Review that places a ghostb~ters 
sign over twO gay men havi ng 
intercourse wi th the phrase "Stop 
AIDS" is the most childish 
malicious and devious aue'mpt at 
inciting mob violence against the 
gay community seen in San 
Diego since the last printing of 
the KKK manual. And if the 
Review does not issue a public 
apology over this mons trosity, it 
should be banned from UCSD 
forever.

settlement in the town region of 
Central America. 

We concllldpd that it was in 
the best interests of aU Central 
American countries to reach a 
peaceful accord: And we 
determined that the Contadora 
nations (MeXICO, Panama, 
Venezuela and Columbia) and 
the Lima Support Group (Peru, 
Argent inia, Uruguay and Brazil) 
should strongly suppon that 
framework by applying 
diplomatic pr~ssure on the 
United States to withdraw its 
funding of the contras. 

With the demilitarization of 
Central America in the .works, it 
might be possible to see US aid 
take the form of bread and buneF 
instead of helicopters and 
gunships. 

The major catch to a peaceful 
framework would come when the 
Department of Defense or 
Pentagon refuses to accept any 
settlement Other than one that 
would guarantee US military 
dominance over the region. 

The treaty would reqUire the 
Sandinistas to boot all foreign 
military advisors out of their 
country in exchange for the end 
of the contra war. 

The Sandinistas have pledged 
to do so if the US pulls out of 
the region , but that is only a 
pipe dream while the Reagan 
Administration is still in control. 

The Pentagon released a report 
last Tuesday named , ·Prospect 
for Containment of Nicaragua's 
Communist [sicl Govemment," 
which simplistically claimed that 
if Contadora'were enforced, the 
Nicaraguan government would 
break the agreement within three 
years. The report went on to say 

Tutsday. May 27. 1986 .5 
OPINIONS 

that the US would be "forced" to 
send 100,000 Army troops into 
the region at a cost of $9.1 
billion a year. 

In a nutshell , the Pervagon 
says that if we do not continue 
funding the mercenary contras in 
their attempt to overthrow the 
freely-elected Sandinisra 
gov~rnment, they will disappear 
because of a lack of popular 
support. Therefore , the 
Sandinistas will be free to 
support popular uprisings in 
Honduras, EISalvadorand 
Guatemala against repressive 
govemments. 

The US military will then enter 
Central America in the defense 
of murderous Central American 
security apparatuses. Wonderful 
way to spend your tax dollars , 
isn't it? 

We are back to circle one 
with our discussion from thi~ 
time and last , as we examine 
how the peril of famine is taking 
another form and Jumping up 
toward the United States. The 
famine ~hat we face takes a more 
purely political shape. The seeds 
of peace, justice and equali ty are 
being swept away by the hot air 
blOwing from Washington, D.e. 

The line for the royalty at the 
Pentagon, the idiots in the White 
House, the greedy corporate 
owners who oppose divestment 
in their positions as UC Regents 
and Central American and South 
African warlords is no longer "let 
them eat cake ," it is "let them 
swallow bullets." ~

driver contacts and advises his 
supervisor of his location, a "hot 
load," when fire breaks out, or if 
there is something already 
smoldering in the garbage truck. 

The supervisor informs the 
driver of the nearest safe spot to 
get the burning load off the 
diesel truck, and the supervisor 
then calls the fire depanment 
and instructs them to meet the 
driver at this safe Spot. Once at 
the Glider Pon, the trash is 
packed tighter so that it will 
burn less freely and will spread 

, less. 
Each UCSD department using 

chemicals is responsible for 
collecting the excess chemicals 
from its laboratories for ensuring 
that these chemicals are 
processed properly.

Thursdays, The old chemicals 
from the Chemistry 8AL lab class 
we pick up on Mondays," Dan 
Rille ra , supervisor of the lab 
assistants in the chemistry 
depanment said. 

"Sometimes the TAs cannot 
watch all their students and 
students throw chemicals into 
the trash . Sometimes the 
students do not pay attention to 
the waste bottles for collecting 
the used chemicals," he added . 

"All the chemicals from the 
class were supposed to go into a 
big jar at the front of the class, 
but few students followed that 
procedure. The majority of the 
students threw the chemicals 
down the drain because it was 
the lazy and easy way out," a 
student who had Chemistty 
143A lab said. 

By university regulations, 
chemicals are not supposed to 
be thrown down the drain 
because toxic chemicals are not 
really di~posed of that way, Steve 
Kowalewsky, assistant 
Environmental Health and Safety 
technologist, said . 

"I was always amazed because 
we used some known 
carcinogens. I always felt that the 
freshmen and sophomores were 
too irresponsible to deal with 
such chemicals," the I43A 
student added . 

Custodians cleaning the labs 
are instructed not to pick up any 
trash if they find test tubes in 
the waste can or if they smell 
anything strange , but to call a lab 
assistant, according to Rillera. 
The suspicious trash is sent ot 
EH&'S where technicians are 
informed of which chemcials 
were used in the lab that day so 
that th e trash can be analyzed to 
detect any danger. 

The lab assistants that collect 
the used chemicals have no 
formal training in the disposal of 
toxic wastes, but are encouraged 
to refer to safety books and the 
Material Safety Data sheets 
available on each chemical, 
Rillera said. They are also 
warned to take caution and to 
take Toxic Waste Disposal 
classes through the extension 
program for one or more 

quarters , he said . 
When the technicians from 

EH&'S colleCt the used chemicals 
from all the labs on Tuesdays 
and Thursdays, the chemicals 
must be in closed containers that 
will not leak according to 
Kowalewsky. The sealed bottles 
must be separated by 
compatibility and must be 
labeled with the name of the 
chemical and the name of the 
investigator, he added. 

Periodic inspections of the 
laboratories are perl( :ned by 
EH&'S technicians . 1 ne 
frequence of these "Lab Safety 
Surveys· depends upon the 
hazard level of the lab. The 
chemistry labs are checked about 
once a year when the 
technicians use their noses, eyes 
and other obvious methods to 
look for excess amounts of 
flammable chemicals and the 
improper handling or storage of 
chemicals, 

The bottles of chemicals are 
taken bi-weekly from the labs to 
the UCSD Waste Processing 
Station for packaging for 

transportation under the 
regulations stirulated by the 
Depanment 0 Transportation 
and the California Depanmem of 
Health. The chemicals are then 
transported to a state authorized 
toxic dump such as the Casmalia 
site in Santa Barbara county. 

"It is illegal to dump a 
chemical in a public refuse if it 
cannot be properly dumped," 
Captain Russell Palmer said. "The 
biological stuff is the biggest fear 
since this' is what we know the 
least about," he added. 

Twice the Torrey Pines Golf 
Course had to close for about 
two hours because fire officials 
determined that the smoke from 
the fires at Glider Port may be 
toxic, according to Carol Wood, 
golf starter supervisor at the golf 
course. The first accident in 
February, police evacuated the 
southern pan of the golf course 
adjacent to the Glider Port. The 
golfers played around the closed 
holes. The second time the 
whole course - both the south 
and north sections were 
evacuated by the police. ~

When the lights go down in Lima 
By VAN HUTCHINSON 

I TS NOT GOOD to be stuck in an elevator in Lima when there is Apagon . You could 
be stranded for hours . Apagon, 
which means "lights out," is 
becoming commonplace in Peru, 
and is the result of a terrorist 
bombing at one of the outlying 
power stations. It is only one 
manifesta tion of increasing 
terrorism in Peru, and it is 
beginning to affect American 
students living there. 

When Patty Hammer went to 
Peru through UC's Education 
Abroad Program, she knew to 
expect typical third world 
conditions. In Peru, poverty 
stares out from the fearful eyes of 
children on the arid coastal 
plains and among the indian 
people in the mountains. 

What surprised her was the 
high level of crime, corruption 
and instability, especially in the 
city. She said she didn't wear a 
watch or any jewelry because it 
could literally be ripped off her 
body in broad daylight Even her 
Peruvian girl friends would put 
on their jewelry after arriving at a 
party for fear of having it stolen 
while walking up to the door! 

While theft and corruption are 
viewed as "normal ," given the 
poverty and social instability in 
Peru, life-threatening violence is 
not. It has recently become an 
issue of worldwide concern, and 
most of the anentlon has been 
focused on a group of organlzed 
terrorists active in the southern 
part of the country. 

"Sendero Luminoso," or "The 
Shining Path" has been blamed 
(or has taken "credit") for 
numerous bombings In Lima. the 

capital of Peru, and especially in 
Ayac ucho. to the south. 

Sendero Luminoso is a 
communist faction affiliated 
more strongly with Maoist 
philosophy then "Castro ism" per 
se, and it is bent on destabilizing 
the status quo, no matter what it 
takes. In a recent attack assumed 
to be connected with the 
Sendero Luminoso , a car bomb 
exploded near'''e1 palicio" of the 
government, killing numerous 
people. 

The city of Ayacucho bears the 
brunt of the attacks. Richard 
Diaz-Canedo, a UCSD 
sophomore who used to live in 
southern Peru, said one reason 
may be that since the city is so 
close to the jungle, it provides 
both sites to attack and places to 
hide. The terrorists have focused 
mainly on embassies, banks, and 
have even targeted a Kentucky 
Fried Chicken restaurant. 

The irony of such violence, 
which some say is verging on 
the point of civil war, is that the 
Peruvian government is leftist 
itself. APRA, the Alianza Popular 
Revolucionaria Americana, has 
finally won power. It has agitated 
for social change since the 
1920s, when the APRA leader 
was exiled by a dictator who was 
propped up by American 
commercial interests and military 
might. 

But Just twO years ago, APRA's 
Alan Garcia-Perez was elected on 
a wave of populanty. His social 
programs and campaign to 
revitalize the long-stagnant 
economy received wide support 
- except from Sendero 
Luminoso and other fringe 

~ ~) 
I 

groups such as a cabal of right 
wing police he had fired . 

Ironically, one of the first tasks 
of the progressive new 
government was to stamp out the 
violence which seemed to flare 
up as unpredictably as an 
underground natural gas fire . 
Tanks appeared in the streets of 
LIma this year, and a state of 
emergency is presently in effect. 
No one may be in the streets 
from 1:00 am to 5:00 am , and 
the embassies downtown are in a 
constant state of alert. 

\ 
') 

Patty Hammer and another 
student, joe Wanio, who 
returned from EAP in Peru last 
year, were directly affected by 
the chaos in Lima. Most striking, 
they said, was ApagOn . 

Patty said, "When this 
happens, everything goes crazy. 
People are driving on the 
sidewalk just to get home - or 
wherever they can get to that's 
safe." She said the police hide. 
They are afraid of being shot. 
For stores, Apagon is a 
nightmare. One can hear thle 
crash of glass in darkness as the 
looters break loose. . 

But the Latins are survivors. 
They have made adjustments. 
Apagon becomes yet another 
excuse to have a parry. The 
candles are ready, and the guitar 
comes out for a song. How about 
a rousing rendition of a good 
yanqUi song, "Boom Boom, Out 
Go the Lights?" 

Apan from sporadic 
disruption, life in Lima is laid-
back. joe Wanio commented that 
La CatcSlica University is much 
less intense than UCSD. 
Professors often don 't show up 

class, and the number of 
'<;.ltUQ,f'nt strikes is superceded 

only by the plethora of national 
holidays. Richard Diaz-Caned) 
said, "Sometimes students may 
strike against a particular teacher 
Just because he grades toO hard ." 

In any case. having a s trong 
family connection makes up for 
some of the confusion inherent 
in being an exchange student . 
Things in Lima don't go by the 
rules - they go by who you 
know. So when I arrive in Lima 
in july, I'll be sure to make 
friends fast and leam the going 
rates on bribes. 

All I ask is that they don't 
knock out the power while I'm 
walking down the sidewalk. Il:rl 

Marching against 
anns and apathy 
By BRYAN HARRIS, Staff Writer 

Y EAR AFTER YEAR, fewer . Americans make the time or take the 
responsibility to vote . Perhaps 
they don't feel like walking the 
three blocks to the polling 
center. But today, roughly 500 
Americans are marching 
approximately 3,000 miles 
toward Washington, D.C., 
hoping to disarm nuclear 
arsenals and combat the apathy 
and ignorance that plague [he 
nation. 

the way, they have been called 
other names, not all of them 
nice. Some people label them 
unpatriotiC freaks. However, such 
deluded appraisals mean little. 
The marchers seek to strengthen 
the United States by waking 
citizens from their political 
slumber. They are not freaks for 
wanting a life free from nuclear 
paranOia. 

Name-calling does not pose a 
threat to [he Great Peace March. 
Diane Shea, a marcher who is in 

The marchers seek to strengthen the 
United States by waking citizens from their 
political slumber, .. 

The Great Peace March for 
Nuclear Disarmament began in 
Barstow, California on March 19 
of this year. It is a grassroots 
congregation of doctors, 
scientists , punks, accountants, 
attorneys, hippies and middle-
class Americans, speckled with 
several international marchers, as 
we ll. • 

Regardless of background , 
each partici t,ant has acquired a 
new title - abolitionist . Along 

San Diego to raise funds, says, 
"Indifference is the greatest 
poison." Understandably, the 
Great Peace March has 
encountered linle indifference. 

Along the route , peace 
marchers have passed nuclear 
test s ites where local citizens 
experience the effects of 
radiation . The tears In the eyes 
of those Americans will long be 
remembered by th marchers. 

Shea says, "People see 
Please !Urn to page 11 

Marching for peace 
Continued from page I () 
themselves in us ." This explains 
why so many people are eager to 
help the cause. Whole 
communities have done much to 
ease the hardships for the 
hikers . 

Usually the marchers camp at 
night in tems. They Stand in line 
with their fatigued companions 

• for their dinner. Communities 
which are especially supportive 
organize to adopt the marchers. 
when they reacb that 
neighborhood. Community 
members drive the marchers 
from the daily walk's end to local 
homes where warm showers, 
dinners , conversation and sleep 
embrace the bushed bodies of 
the hikers . Rest is brief, and the 
marchers rise at 4 :30 am to 
prepare for their daily hike that 
is their testimony to peace. 

The rigorous routine endured 
by the marchers reflects their 
extraordinary dedication to 
involvement and peace. Some of 
them have sold their farms and 
most have quit their jobs for the 
opportunity to promote peace 
day after day before a national 

audience . 
Bob Schuler, another march 

participant, briefly visiting San 
Diego, adds, "There are many 
ways to be a marcher." He 
stresses that everyone must know 
that their vote matters and that 
each person can make a 

·difference. 
The Great Peace March is 

sowing seeds along the way. 
Marchers speak to high school 
students, shOWing them how 
they can affect change in their 
community. Shea is teaching that 
"commitment is the most 
satisfying thing in the world ." 

As the marchers pass from 
town to town they leave behind 
not only good feelings , but 
cleaner streets as well . Aluminum 
cans that litter the highways are 
removed and recycled. Though 
the marchers may nor have 
showered for days, the roads 
they cross are sure to be scoured . 

The money raised fro m 
recycling cans is admittedly a 
pittance compared to the daily 
~ost of supporting the marchers. 
Approximately $3.000 a day is 

exhclusted on food , 
transportation and other 
expenses. Meeting these financial 
demands is a constant burden 
for every marcher since none of 
them is individually financed. • 
They funetion entirely as a 
group. . 

Money is being raised from all 
quarters. Benefits like the one at 
the Cht' Caft' ensure little by 
little that the Great Peace March 
will reach the Capital. 
Celebrities, actors, musicians lind 
concerned people everywhere are 
contributing to nonviolent 
expression, dedication and 
involvement. 

Both .Bob Schuler and Diane 
Shea look fOlWard to rejoining 
the march soon. It is scheduled 
to end on November 14 in ' 
Washington, D.C., where they 
hope thousands will join the 
family of committed marchers in 
an appeal to the executive 
representative of the American 
public, President Reagan. 

One in the crowd , a young 
Japanese man, will hold a torch 
taken from the Eternal flame in 
Hiroshima that bums in hope 
that such a disaster will never . 
occur again. 

Whether the peace march will 
abolish nuclear warheads

Jessica Vernon lost in three sets to eventual singles winner Debbie Daniels of Trenton State. 

Defending doubles 
challlps dethroned 
Vernon, Merickle, lose in national 
semis to Principia, 6-2, 6-2 
By GUS SANTOYO. Contributing Sports Editor 

Daniels of Trenton State in the 
first round by the scores of 6-4. 
5-7. 6-3. Daniels, the number 
two seed in the tournament, 
went on 'to win it all, and from 
her play in their match. Vernon 
was not surprised, . 

By MOST standards, Jessica Vernon and Maggie Merickle certainly had an 
impressive season. The UCSD 
doubles team qualified for the 
Division III women's 
championshlf>s, defeating the 
number two seed Tremon State 

], and Rust College of Mississippi 
ct before losi ng to Principia College 
'tl of Illmois in the semifinals, c;:; 

"She hit the heck out of the 
ball," said Vernon. "I've never 
returned a serve thar hard from 
anyone , even from a guy." 

£' But the comparisons to last 
year are inevitable, as both were 
members of UCSD's national 
championship squad, and 
Vernon, along with Nadine 

Wl RJ; To WI R~II ~ 
Okamoto, captured th'e national 

. crown in the doubles divison, 
But Vernon isn't disappointed 
wi th their success this year. 
. "We had a lot of fun this 

year," said Vernon, "In some 
ways it would have been nice to 
end it laSt year because our team 

Daniels, who was not in the 
last tournament because'of 
injuries, had not been pushed to 
play three sets all year until she 
met with Vernon. "In the second 
set I tried to stay calm and just 
put a lot of topspin on the ball. 
But I just made a lot of mistakes 
in the third set," said Vernon. 

Vernon, a 23-year-old San 
Diegan and animal physiology 
majqr, will coninue to play in 
tournaments after graduation. but 
doesn't plan to make a carreer of 
it. "I can't just concentrate on 
tennis," said Vernon, "because I 
love to ski , scuba dive, play 
volleyball and softball. I just plan 
to have fun at it." 

The Avocado League? 
Work has already begun on the new sporting 

complex to be located where the present Olsen 
Field is, east of 1-5 across from Scripps Hospital. So 
far a new parking lot at the entrance to the old field 
is all that one can see of the developm.ent (which is 
eventually to become home to a 5-7,000 seat arena), 
but the athletic department has some big Ideas in 
mind just around the comer. . 

One rumor has a major league franchise playing 
spring training at the new baseball complex. One 
team whose name has arisen in connection with 
play here is the Minnesota Twins . Although any 
spri ng training at Olsen Field would conflict with 
the Triton regular season, baseball coach Lyle Yates 
is sure something could be worked out. "A pro team 
would really help put UCSD on the athletic map." 
said Yates. 

Down on the fann 
For Lyle Yates, the success of this year's baseball 

team (their 22-19-2 record was their best ever) is 
likely to yield a bittersweet story. Three Tritons, the 
nucleus of this year's team, are probably going to be 
offered pro contracts after the amateur draftJune 4. 
The three. all juniors, are Bob Natal (catcher/ right 
field), Dan DiMascio (right field / catcher/ pitcher) 
and Derek Alkonis ( third baseman). 

"We'd love to have them all back," said Yates, "Bur 
we want what's best for them. It's been a pleasure 
working with all of them thl' last three years. But 
they've tOld me that if the ofiers are not right they'll 
be back. I think the taste of regionals they got this 
season is tough to overlook." 

Last year at this time ex-Triton lefty David 
DeCordova was packing his bags and heading for 
winter rookie league with the St. Louis Cardinals, In 
one short year DeCordova has already made the 
jump to double M ball - successfully, 

"Apparently, Dave's come up with a split-finger 
pitch which has helped his fastball ." said his former 
coach Lyle Yates. "He's been posting some pretty 
good stats, and there's not toO many southpaws in 
the Cardinal organization, so things are looking 
pretty good for Mr. DeCordova." Indeed. 

Defense? What defense? 
From Sunday's LA Times comes a quote from 

Charger coach Don "D" Coryell: "You won't see me 
trying to act important by coaching individual 
defensive players, The best way to foul up a player is 
to have different coaches telling a guy what to do. I'll 
encourge or get mad, but I won't do individual 
coaching. I just care about seeing that a guy gets 
good coaching (from position coaches) ," 
Translation: I still don't know nuthin' 'bout defense, 

Track tragedy 
Occasionally the relationship between reporters 

and athletes can get a little strained. At Cal State LA 
last weekend, a reporter was killed when an errant 
hammerthrow smICk him in the head. Despite the 
tragedy, the athletes voted not to postpone the 
LOurnament one day, 

Turning the tide. 
The San Diego Sockers are on the verge of pulling 

off what the LA Lakers could not. The Sockers have 
overcome a 3-1 deficit - with the unwitting help of 
the witless Minnesota Striker's goalie Tino "the 
taunter" Lettieri - to tie the championship series at 
three a piece before Monday's deciding game. 

More feets 
Outdoor sooccer fans will get a thrill Tuesday 

when the Dundee Football Club of Scotland comes 
to town, They're playing UCSD soccer coach Derek 
Armstrong's San Diego Nomads in a Western 
Alliance match at Balboa Stadium at 7 pm. Dundee 
won the premier soccer league in-Scotland this year, 
The Nomads feature two Tritons , goalie Alberw 
Gomez and forward Joe Giacclonp 

The red-headed Dead-head will be the difference 

Crunch-time 
For the millions who witnessed the Miracle in 

Inglewood , where Ralph Sampson, with no time 
left on the clock, hit a rurnaround prayer that left the 
purple and gold crowd at the Forum in a blue mood , 
it washed away any hopes that many had for 
anexher Celtic-Laker rematch , 

The Rockets, however, are going to need a 10l 
more luck with the Boston Celtics, who have left 
their Eastern opponents wishing they were in the 
draft lottery, 

Houston undoubtably has emerged with the best 
set of from court players in Akeem Olajuwon and 
Ralph Sampson. Boston's Kevin McHale and Robert 
Parrish will have their hands full, but the Celtics 
have the league's best sixth man in Bill Walton, who 
all of a sudden gOt better when he found a winning 
team to play on, If you're still interested , pick the 
Celtics to win in SIX games, 

- John Schacht &t GuSlaVO Santoyo 

won the national championship 
and we won the doubles title, 
Even though it didn't end with a 
bang like it did last year, I'm still 
extremely happy and I had a 
great time this year," 

Head coach Liz LaPlante was 
pleased with the duo's 
performance in the playoffs, held 
at Kalamazoo, Michigan, "T he 
girls played well," said LaPlame, 
"they had beaten Prinicipia last 
year. but Courtney Allen and Sue 
Godfrey have really improved 
since then," 

Vernon also qualified for the 
playoffs in the singles division 
and was knocked out by Debbie 

U1Plante will have to fill some 
major holes in her team next 
year with the departure of 
Vernon and three other girls who 
made the nucleus of her squad . • 
"Rhonda Meier and Denise Sugi 
will be coming back next year 
and along with some top recruits 
from Texas and Northern 
California, we should be pretty 
strong next year." En 

p results in 
Thursday's issue.
