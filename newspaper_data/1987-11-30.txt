UCSD labor 
union starts 
petition drive 

Complains of unfair 
election process 

By CYNTHIA CHESY . 
St~J W,it~' 

The Clilifornia Education 
Labor Organization (CELO), an 
independent labor organization 
at UCSD, has recently begun a 
drive to submit to state legisla-
tors a petition listing complaints 
against the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees (AFSCME), the ex-
clusive bargaining agent for UC 
employees systemwide in cleri-
cal, patient care and service 
worker units. 

CELO, founded by UCSD 
employees in 1982, claims 100 
members with about 25 active 
people at the core. It is a member-
controlled labor cooperative . 
"CELO is promoting a collective 
self-interest, and all of the power 
is in the ~ands of the members," 
M MatKtri, the campus 
coordinator, said in an inter-
view. 

AFSCME, the official bar-
gaining agent for UCSDclerical, 
patient care and service worker 
units since 1982, negotiates con-
tracts with UC management that 
affect 3,600 employees. 

Both CELO and AFSCME 
represent clerical, patient care, 
and service workers who are 
involved in grievances against 
UCSD management. 

CELO can "represent members 
up to arbitration, and from there 
the case goes off-campus to a 
separate.. arbitrator," Li Mandri 
said. "Only AFSCME can take 
the case to arbitration and [only 
AFSCME] has the right of pay-
roll deduction." Payroll deduc-

tions are deductions made from 
a union member's paycheck that 
are used to pay his or her dues. 

"CELO's point is that if we 
can do steps one, two and three, 
why can't we take it to arbitra-
tion? CELO wants to reverse the 
1982 Public Employment Relations 
Board (PERB) decision to have 
systemwide representation and 
have campus-by-campus repres-
entation. We want the right to 
payroll deductions, and the right 
to take it to arbitration. 
But the first step is to allow 
UCSD employees a democratic 
right to decide what they want to 
do; do they want AFSCME, do 
they want CELO, or do they 
want no representation at all, let 
them choose," Li Mandri said. 

PERB is a state agency res-
ponsible for overseeing collec-
tive bargaining laws for the pub-
lic school system, higher educa-
tion, and state employees. Its 
jurisdiction is confined to pro-
tecting an employee's choice as 
to whether or not to join a labor 
union. 

The crux of Li Mandri's com-
plaints is that "in 1982 CELO 
could not run in the election 
because it was not a party to the 
p[oceedings; we came together 
after the initiation procedure for 
collective bargaining, so rather 
than take our view into consid-
eration, the Public Employment 
Relations Board threw them out 
the window." 

Furthermore "CELO did not 
have the $1,020 million that 
AFSCME spent on the campaign 
in 1982, so it was impossible to

After a four-and-a-half hour 
interview with the A.S. president 
and the A.S. council's approval, 
Mordecai Potash was appointed 
vice president of External Affairs 
until elections in the spring. 

Potash replaces Jill Marchick, 
who resigned in late October due 
to health problems. 

Potash is the state lobby direc-
tor for UCSD and is on the Muir 
Commuter Board as well as a 
principle member in the Union 
of Jewish Students. His expe-
rience as the state tobby director 
has enabled him to meet with leg-
islators and hold a key role in the 
voter registration drive at 
UCSD. 

In this normally elected posi-
tion, the vice president of Exter-
nal Affairs supervises at least 10 
people, including the UC Stu-
dent Association undergraduate 
representative and the Lobby 
Annex director, and serves as a 
liaison between lite university 
and the community. 

"A lot of complaints I hear are 
what does the A.S. do? And that 
they're all a bunch of 'frat' boys 
trying to put something good on 
their resumes. I don't believe 
that has to be true," Potash said . 

Potash plans on establishing

the External Affairs office and

Scientific exhibition 
opens at Scripps Aquarium 

A special exhibition of scientific 
artwork will open at cripps 
Aquarium-Museum Dec. 5. The exhi-
bition is provided by the Smithsonian 
Institution Traveling Exhibition Ser-
vice (SITES) and contains over eighty 
illustrations of fishes dating back to 
1838. 

The exhibition, "Drawn from the 
Sea: Art in the Service of Ichthyol-
ogy," demonstrates the importance of 
illustrations as tools for scientific 
study, while providing an intriguing 
glimpse into the history and beauty of 
this exacting art. 

Organized bv Dr. Victor Springer, 
ichthyologist (one who deals in the 
branch of zoology which deals with 
fish) , with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion's National Museum of Natural 
History, the exhibit contains some of 
the most intricate drawings of marine 
life ever produced . The artistic illustra-
tions contain the precise detailing that 
photographs do not reveal. 

The unique beauty of the illustra-
tions represent the work of 21 artists, 

from self-taught amateur to 
professionally-trai ned ill ustrators, 
whose careers span the 19th and 20th 
centuries. 

The exhibit will be on display in the 
museum at Scripps Aquarium-

which will pay for the CSOs. 

If enough students take advantage 
of the expanded hours this quarter, 
then the hours may be extended dur-

Down's and Alzheimer's 
connection discussed 

Many Down's Syndrome victims 
develop Alzheimer's disease in their 
30s and 4Os, according to Dr. Charles 
J . Epstein, professor of pediactrics at 
the University of California, San 
Francisco. Epstein will discuss the 
relationship between the Downs' Syn-
drome and Alzheimer's disease in a 
free public lecture sponsored by the 
UCSD Institute for Research on 
Aging on Wednesday , Dec. 9. 

"Down 's Syndrome and Alzheimer's 
disease - What is the connection?" 
will be presented at 3 pm in Lieb Aud-
itorium, 505 Coast Blvd. South in La 
Jolla, and again at Is pm on the Leo-
nard Garren Auditorium, located in 
the UCSD School of Medicine's Basic 
Science Building. 

Genes, the material that determines 
the unique structures of all life, are 
organized into chromosomes. Recently 
researchers located both the familial 
gene for Alzheimer's and the gene for 
a protein abnormally produced by its 
victims on chromosome 21 - the 
same chromosomes associated with 
Down's symndrome. As a result of 
these discoveries , scientists are now 
studying possible connections between 
the two disorders. 

Epstein earned his bachelor's degree 
from Harvard College and his medical 
degree from Harvard Medical School. 
Since 1967 he has served as chief of 
the Division of Medical Genetics in 
the Department of Pediactrics and 
director of the Birth Defects Centerl 
Genetics Clinic at UC San Francisco. 

Noted UCSD researcher 
dies of cancer 

Dr. Marlene DeLuca, a pioneer in 
the field of bioluminescence research 
and wife of former UCSD Ch.ancellor 
William D. McElroy, died recently of 

...... '.N.' ... » 

cancer at cripps Memorial Hospital 
in La Jolla . 

Deluca, 51 , had been a member of 
the UCSD chemistry department since 
1972. She was perhaps best known for 
her research, along with her husband, 
into bioluminescence, and recently 
made headlines worldwide when her 
team of investigators successfully 
transfixed into a tobacco plant a gene 
that codes for light production. 

It has almost been one year since 
DeLuca and her colleagues, UCSD 
molecular geneticist Donald R. 
Helinski; plant biologist Stephen H. 
Howell; UCSD post-doctoral fellow 
David W. Ow; and graduate students 
Keith V. Wood and Jeffery R. de Wet 
announced in Science Magazine the 
success of their efforts. 

"This is the first time anyone has 
taken a gene that codes for light pro-
duction and transferred it into the ge-
netic material of a complex multi-cell-
ular organism," Helinski said at the 
time. 

Edward Dennis , chairman of the 
UCSD Academic Senate and a col-
league in rhe chemistry department 
added: "She was a devoted scientist 
and teacher who made her major con-
tributions to understanding the bio-
chemical basis of how fireflies light. 
She was a dedicated and skilled indi-
vidual who will be sorely missed by 
students and facult y alike." 

Memorial service for 
communications T A 

A memorial service for Martha 
(Marti) tum Suden will be held on 
Sunday, Dec. 6 1987 at the Mountain 
View Lounge, Third College, UCSD 
from 1-3 pm. 

tum Suden, a PhD candidate at 
UCSD, was a victim of a hit and run 
driver. tum Suden graduated from 
UCSD in 1981 with a B.A. in ~ociol­
ogy, and received her M.A. in educa-
tion from Stanford in 1982. She 
earned her M.A. in sociology at 
UCSD in 1985 and was a PhD candi-
date in the communications depart-
ment. She had been a teacher's assist-
ant in numerous introductory 
communications courses.

AFSCME then or now ... we 
were aced out," Li Mandri said . 

Li Mandri contends A FSCM E 
became the exclusive bargaining 
agent in 1982 in an uncontested 
systemwide election . He added 
that there was no minimum voter 
turnout. "This is not fair . . . it 

. was AFSCME or nobody," li 
Mandri said. 

Nandra Floyd, the executive 
director of AFSCME and its 
chief negotiator, said AFSCME 
was elected as the exclusive bar-
gaining agent on seven of the 
nine UC campuses in 1982, with 
a heavy voter turnout. 

The petition drive is CElO's 
latest effort to make public its 
numerous complaints against 
AFSCME since the 1982 el-
ection. 

CELO has obtained member-
ship figures for A FSCM E that 
show a decrease since 1984. 

Li Mandri said the problem 
with AFSCM E is that there is a 
clause in the contract with its 
members - the management 
rights' clause - that gives the 
university the legal right to do 
whatever they want to do in 
determining the terms and con-
ditions of employment .. . 
AFSCME's contract gives em-
ployees less rights than if they 
had no contract at all , Li Mandri 
said. 

"Further, AFSCME has no 
visibility on campus. It's like 
A.S. [Associated Students] being 
elected on a systemwide basis. 
You never saw them, you knew 
you were paying dues but you 
never had any contact with them. 
A significant majority of people 
on this campus think AFSCM E 
is undeserving of the role that 
they have." 

According to the decertifica-
tion clause of the Higher Educa-

~ion Employees Relations Act, 
10 order for employees to decer-
tify AFSCME, 30 percent of the 
employees within that unit have 
to sign a statement saying that 
they want new elections. 

"How are clerical and service 
worker employees at UCSD, who 
work for a living, going to spon-
taneously, in a coordinated way, 
get 30 percent of the systemwide 
votes? It cost A FSC M E millions 
to get on the ballot in 1982, hir-
ing organizers and people to walk 
around and get signatures," Li 
Mandri said . 

"AFSCME does not represent 
employees in a competent 
manner. It's AFSCME'sdecision 
whether or not to take a case to 
arbitration, which costs about 
$1,500. If AFSCME says you 
don't have a case, then you sit 
there with the unsolved matter in 
your file ." 

Floyd responded to the allega-
tions by saying that "AFSCME 
'was charged with representing 
people, member or not, and has 
a duty of fair representation. 
AFSCM E is not required to take 
every grievance to arbitration 
but they have to make a decision, 
as long as its not arbitrary and 
the party has the right to appeal 
the decision."

News media to blame for 
Reagan's popularity 
Editor: 

Our critic is so eager to jump 
to P resid ent R eagan's defense, 
he does so in a case where Fresi-
dent R eagan was never even 
attacked. Our research is a re-
minder of the widely available 
information that shows Reagan 
to have been a surprisingly un-
popular president in 1981 , 1982, 
and well into 1983. As the econ-
omy improved, so did Reagan's 
job approval ratings. Reagan was 
re-elected by an impressive mar-
gin in 1984. We never suggested 
otherwise. 

nile court judge before she can 
have a legal abort ion . In Cali-
fo rnia, a nnually, about 30,000 
females under the age of 18 have 
abortions. This new law will have 
a ch ill ing effect o n a segment of 
the UCSD population - fema le 
members of the enteri ng class 
who are mi nors a nd mi les a way 
from their parents. 

Open communication. trust, 
and family unity and support 
between parents and teen-agers 
in a cri is situatio n cannot be 
mandated and enforced by this 
or any law in home situations 
where parental unders tanding 
and cooperation d id not preex-
ist. This law opera tes under an 
ideal, not und er the unfortunate 
but realistic pragmatics of Amer-
ican family life in the 20th cen-
tury. Pregnant minors, fearing 
parental reprisal, may increase 
health risks by delaying or 
attempting self-induced abor-
tions. 

CAN 'fOU SPOT THE NATIVE CAL.IFORNIAN AND HIS DOG? 

But public approval of R ea-
gan in his firs t years in office, 
after his 1980 election victory 
with 50.8 percent of the popular 
vote, was lower than for any 
other elected president since 
World War I I. Meanwhile, the 
media reported - and the Con-
gress believed - that Reagan 
was unpreeedentedly popular. 
Our research indicts the news 
media and the Democrats in 
Congress, nOI President Reagan . 
Reagan had every reason to be 
pleased al the myth of his popu-
larity thaI circulated in Wa-
shington . The new media and 
the Democrats bear the respon-
sibility for failing to correct what 
turned out to be a very powerful 
error.

rains, it doesn't rain on just one 
man's housetop." Every woman,

A caU to repeal new 
California abortion law 
Editor: 

On Jan. I, 1988, a new Cali-
fornia law will require any un-
married female under the age of 
18 to obtain the consent of one 
parent, her guardian or a juve-

Ten states have enacted such 
laws, and half have been blocked 
by court orders. A hearing for a 
preliminary injunction against 
this California law has been 
scheduled for Dec. 21. I h ighly 
urge letters to Governor George 
Deukmejian seeking the repeal 
of this new law.

OPINIONS 

How do you feel about the new California abortion law?* 

"/ think this law is u'!!ortunate. 
Tht decision to keep or abort an 
unwanted pregnancy is hard 
enough without the necessity for 
partntal or judie/al approval. The 
body and person in question does 
not belong to the parent or the 
courts ... this ike/sion has too big 
an impact on the woman to be left 
to anyone but herself. ..

DNA analysis simplified by new 'scissors' 
By STUART WOLPERT 

LOS ANGELES - Scientists 
at UCLA have developed a 
"molecular scissors" capable of 
cutting DNA into large pieces. 
an advance that may ena..ble 
scientists to determine more effi-
ciently the sequence of the chem-
ical bases that make up genes 
and to better understand the 
structure of chromosomes. 

Institute, and his research asso-
ciate Chi-Hong Chen - report 
their findings in the Sept. 4 issue 
of the journal Science. 

determine how defective genes 
cause disease , as well as identify 
people carrying abnormal genes. 

easier if you can reduce the com-
plexity by assembling one seg-
ment of the puzzle at a time and 
then joining the larger pieces 
together to complete the whole. 
We have created a way to cut 
large ON A into intermediate-
sized pieces, which can be se-
quenced by methods currently 
available. 

Sigman says it is too soon to 
know how valuable a tool the 
cleaving device will prove to be, 
but the potential implications 
are significant. Sigman and Chen chemically 

engineered a protein that nor-
mally binds to DNA and con-
verted it into a cleaving device 
that can cut DNA into substan-
tially larger sections than has 
been possible. 

Sequencing DNA - plotting 
the precise positions of bases -
follows the principle of "divide 
and conquer." 

Special enzymes currently used 
by scientists are able to cut frag-
ments of chromosomes, but only 
at a very limited number of bases 
they can recognize. 

The scientists - David Sig-
man, a professor of biological 
chemistry in UCLA's School of 
Medicine and Molecular Biology 

Because many diseases have 
genetic origins - including Alz-
heimer's Disease, Down's Syn-
drome and cystic fibrosis -
sequencing will help scientists 

Biologists must first break 
DNA into relatively small frag-
ments to obtain the sequence of 
the bases. and then place each of 
the fragments in the correct order 
to obtain the sequence of the 
much larger DNA. 

"Up until now, scientists have 
been working with a tremendous 
number of miniscule fragments 
of DNA because it has not been 
possible to cut DNA into large 
pieces. Now it is possible." 

The protein Sigman and Chen 
used in their study is the trypto-
phan gene repressor of Escheri-
chia coli ; the "scissors" they at-
tached is the I, IO-phenanthro-
line-copper complex. 1m 

"Sequencing is like doing a 
jigsaw puzzle," Sigman said . "It's

Debate 
ContInued from page 1 
perceive as illegitimate is in itself 
a cause for legitimacy." 

Dr. Bonpane replied in part by 
denying that the Contras were an 
insurgent force , or, a rebel force 
with popular support in Nicara-
gua. "The Contras are not part 
of an insurgent movement," he 
said. "What they are is mercen-
ary terrorists paid with your tax 
money to fight in Nicaragua . 
Should they be paid to fight in 
La Jolla they will fight in La 
Jolla ... that is what a mercenary 
is and that is what you're paying 
for." 

In reponse to the second ques-
tion, on U.S. policy and the 
furtherance of democracy, Dr. 
Bonpane stated with emotion, 
"To be opposed to the revolution 
of the Central American people 
in 1987 is to reject your own 
revolutionary heritage, and I'm 
sure that's what your president 
wants you to do when he calls 
himself a Contra." 

Keenan, who is Latin and lived 
13 years In Bolivia before mov-
ing to the United States, replied, 
"The Nicaraguan government is 
a self-avowed Marxist-Leninist 
regime which has nothing to do 
with the ideal of George Wash-
ington ... Those fighters fighting 
[in Nicaragua] - to describe 
them as mercenaries is truly 
unfair. Would you risk your life 
day after day fighting against an 
army that is far more superior 
.for the dollars [the Contras] get?" 

Keenan concluded that there 
is "a big difference" in the sup-
port the United States had given 
the Contras and the support that 
the Soviet Union has given the 
Sandinista regime, claiming that 
the USSR had outspent the Uni-
ted States in that regard. "Those 
guys are no mercenaries," he 
declared, "they are extremely 
courageous people fighting a 
Communist regime: they are 
Freedom Fighters." 

On the third and final ques-
tion of whether the United States 
should fund the Contras or not, 
the panelists, of course, sharply 
disagreed. At this point Dr. 
Bonpane dismissed his oppo-
nents' arguments, calling them 
lies, told the audience that it was 
better to understand "the mys-
tique of Nicaragua," and pro-
ceeded to sing the Nicaraguan 
song in an effort to get this point 
across. Alario protested to Dr. 
Miyoshi, saying that this was not 
a legitimate argument. 

Dr. Miyoshi declined to stop 
Dr. Bonpane from singing, say-
ing that he could present the 
song as an argument if he thought 
it was such. Dr. Bonpane sang 
his song, and Keenan, Alario, 
and some members of the audi-
ence laughed. IW 

Unions 
Continued from pale 3 
was explained by Floyd as "de-
ceptive, and [as not reflective of] 
a lack of interest on the part of 
the union members." 

Floyd also said the manage-
ment right's clause does give 
management exclusive rights. In 
other words, UC management 
cannot fire somebody without 
just cause. 

Li Mandri said that UCSD 
employees alone should be given 
the right to determine their de-
sired representative, and that that 
is the intent of CELO's petition 
for UCSD ca mpus elections. 

Volunteer are circulating the

Speech and debate is more than just talk 
UCSD's new team gains academic sup.port 

By SAMANTHA BEIGEL 

"You don't have to be a com-
munications major in order to be 
interested in public speaking. It 
is important to learn how to 
communicate even if you are a 
science major . Studies have 
shown that students can't com-
municate with the lay person 
because they are too technologi-
cally oriented," said UCS D's 
speech and debate coach Kathy 
Waste. 

A speech and debate team? At 
U C D? Most students don't 
know that such an organization 
exi ts here. However, these peo-
ple also don't know that this 
team took Third Place Sweep-

Rubes® 

stake at a tournament in Lo 
Angeles last month and that 
many members of the team have 
also won trophies and awards. 
Not bad for a group of mostly 
beginners who are just starting 
to get any kind of a substant ial 
program off the ground . 

Yet, why doesn't UCSD have 
a respecta ble forensic program 
like most other major universi-
ties? UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, 
UC Davis and UCLA all ha ve 
full- time, fu nded forensics pro-
grams which are nationally rec-
ognized . UCSD doesn't even 
offer one speech clas .

who teaches speech classes at 
Palomar Col\ege and has coached 
for San Diego Sate University, 
in an attempt to start a speech 
program at UCSD. Tucker, who 
was approached about two-and-
a-half years ago by students inter-
ested in starting a speech and 
debate program, decided that a 
forensics program was an excel-
lent idea . 

"There is a definite need for 
the enhancement of communica-
tions skills," Tucker said . "Our 
graduate students have expressed 
that a speech program is essen-
tial, as oral presentation is neces-
sary as our graduates strive to 
compete in business and gradu-
ate school environments. Plus, it 
would be excellent representa-

the academic department and 
offer additional educational en-
hancement of the school." 

According to coach Waste, 
the fundamental problem is get-
ting an actual program started. 
Right now, the speech and debate 
team operates as a student organ-
ization and gets limited funding 
from registration fees and asso-
ciated students. However, most 
universities offer public speak-
ing as a class and offer some type 
of credit for competing and tak-
ing part in the forensics program. 

"I wanted to get some type of 
progra m going at U CS D, .. Waste 
said. "I went through the exten-
sion program which is going to 
be offering an introductory pub-
lic speaking class winter quarter. 
This is the first time in the his-
tory of the university that any 

type of speaking class will be 
offered. Students will be able to 
get credit for taking the class and 
competing at tournaments." 

Waste noted that many in-
coming freshmen have had exten-
sive speaking and debate expe-
rience in high school, but there 
was nothing offered for them at 
the university. 

"UC Berkeley and UCLA give 
forensics scholarships and recruit 
the honors students into their 
program - this is a good way of 
getting top-notch students to 
come to their universities. Many 
students want to go to UCSD. 
but end up going to San Diego 
State University because they 
have a better financed, nationally 
recognized forensics program. 
They even offer bachelor's and

Sundstrom 'kicks' 
UCSD into shape 
By JEFF SCHLlCT 

W hen UCSDispromot-ing it s impressive teaching staff you can 
be sure that the names of nobel 
laureates and other prize-winning 
members of the scientific com-
munity will be mentioned . How-
ever, by putting all the attention 
on the award-winning faculty, 
UCSD neglects to notice a very 
different type of teacher. This 
second group consists of the 
teachers who are accessible to 
undergraduates; teachers whom 

students can get to know on a

One such teacher is Linda

classes a day. To the uninitiated 
exerciser, an hour of aerobics 
may sound undemanding, but 
ask any of her exhausted stu-
dents how easy it is . Between her 
position here and at General 
Dynamics, where she also in-
structs aerobics , Sundstrom 
completes 20 hours a week of 
working out, and this is not 
counting the private lessons she 
gives. 

In the exercise business, peak 
performance equates to high 
energy. Energy is a one-word 
description of Linda. On Tues-
days and Thursdays alone she 
teaches five different one-hour 

However, it's not enough to 
simply come into the classroom 
and go through the motions of 
exercise. To be an effective aero-
bics instructor one has to be able 
to energize the students. "I have 
to be a teacher, a doctor , a psy-
chiatrist, a mother. and an alarm 
clock!" Sundstrom said. "In

OCTOBER 

Athlete of the Month 

Randy Franke 
Men's WIder Polo 
Goalie 
Junior, Muir 
Pre-AMES ~Jor 
Del Mar, CA 

The month of October was full of ups and downs for the UCSD men's water polo 
team. But one of the consistent factors was the play of junior goalie Randy Franke. 
the UCSD Athlete of the Month. 

At 6'6", Franke comes out of the water to block shots abd seems to stretch his 
arms from one side of the goal to the other. He sa\Ied an impressive 102 shots during 
a lQ-game stretch in October, but it was his performance on October 17th that 
caught the attention of 700 enthusiastic polo fans. 

The Tritons took on sixth-ranked Pepperdine University that night in the only 
game under the tights this season. Although Pepperdine was a strong favorite, with 
lull-scholarship athletes and a long tradition of success, the Tritons battted the 

W~ through four quarters, twO overtime periods and a sudden death period 
before winning, 11-10. Time and time again, Franke stopped Pepperdine attacks at 
key moments in the game. At the game's end, he had recorded an incredible IB saves. 

UCSO's season has featured other impressive wins, such as a 7-6 victory over 
eighth-ranked UC Santa Barbara, and other outstanding performances by playrrs 
such as Dave Calder, .JeNerson Smith. Larry Sanders, Tom Schatz and Pete 
McConville. Coach Denny Harper's team is now 12-12 and hanging on to hopes for 
an NCM post-season bid. Randy Franke, nicknamed "The Franchise", will be a large 
factor if that goal is to be realized. 

Also nominated for the October Athlete of the Month was Janet Hughes of the 
tap-ranked UCSO Triton votleyball team.

Speech 
Continued from page 8 
master's degrees in speech com-
munication while UCSD did not 
even have a speech class. How-
ever, we are changing this as 
quickly as possible," Waste said. 

Even though the speech and 
debate team is relatively small, a 
total of 40 people have expressed 
interest and the team has an 
active traveling squad of seven 
(compared to SDSU's 93 com-
peting at the last tournament!)_ 
At the Biola Tournament in Los 
Angeles in October, UCSD won 
Third Place Sweepstakes and 
many members made the finals 
and took home trophies_ Presi-
dent of the team, Chris Stefani-
das, a veteran and star member 
who competed last year, has been 
a first place speaker at almost 
every tournament this year. 

Accordingto Waste, "The mem-
bers of the team have an array of 
talents. Many are beginners or 
have had little experience in pub-
lic speaking and are doing really 
well at extremely competitive 
tournaments ... 

"In order to continue being 
competitive, we need a coaching 

• staff, resources, scholarships, and 
enough time to get a really com-
petitive programs started. We 
have gotten enormous support 
from Assistant Vice Chancellor 
Tom Tucker and from the asso-
ciated student body, and we have 
all worked hard to get this pro-
gram off the ground. But we still 
have a long way to go," Waste 
said . 

Although they just competed 
in a tournament at Cal State 
University Northridge Nov. 21 
and 22, and did very well despite 
the fact that there were over SSO 
people there from S4 schools, the 
team is already planning for 
future competitions. The Fall 
Championships tournamen:, 
UCLA, USC and Cal State Ful-
lerton are all competitions set in 
December. The team has hopes 
of competing at Brown Univer-
sity and will definitely compete 
in January at the Governor's 
Cup tournament in Sacramento. 
Other goals are national tour-
naments in llIinois and Arizona. 

Waste explained that this is 
only the beginning. She stressed 
that classes will enable more 
people to get involved and empha-
sized that there is an area or field 
of speech for everyone - from 
the politically active to the dra-
matically incli ned to the stand 
up comic . 

According to Tucker, the addi-
tion of classes is a good begin-
ning, but he realizes that the 
organization can't expand and 
be truly successful unless it has 
an academic tie_ He maintains 
that the university will wait and 
see how much interest the speech 
classes generate, and then will 
decide how to proceed with a 
fully developed forensics 
program_ However, he sees the 
creation of classes as a "major 
accomplishment and a wonder-
ful way to open the door." 

The class starting winter quar-
ter, "Introduction to College 
Speech Competition," is offered 
on Wednesday nights through 
University Extension. 

"The class is ideal for beginners 
as well as those who have already 
had experience, as it is perfor-
mance oriented and will prepare 
students for competitions," 
Waste said_ 

According to Mary Dalfio at 
Extension, the class will cover 
three areas prepared events 
with a manuscript, dramatic 
events and extemporaneous or 

See SPEECH, pace 13

Continued from pace 11 
unprepared events_ There are no 
prerequisites for registering for 
the class and it is free to all full-
time UCSD students on a limited 
basis . Extension will also offer 
an intermediate level class dur-
ing the spring quarter. @1

and make sure they remain in 
aerobic condition, I try to follow 
each individual's progress. This 
is particularly true for my begin-
ning students since most of them 
are getting involved in aerobics 
for their first time . .. 

"This quarter I've made it 
mandatory that each of my 
beginning students see me in my 
office at least once during the 
quarter so that we can discuss 
their particular needs. The in-
termediate classes are usually 
pretty good about working out 
hard and knowing what they 
need to get in shape, but even 
then there are some students 
with health problems [bad backs, 
hurt wrists] that need specific 
attention," Sundstrom said. 

In her Tuesday and Thursday 
morning classes the sound of 
Sundstrom's music echoes in an 
otherwise empty gym, rousing 
the spirits of 3S or so brave stu-
dents who manage to crawl out 
of bed early enough to exercise_ 
Every quarter, at whatever hour, 
her classes are full because the 
students know that no matter 
how lifeless they may feel at the 
start of class, by the end the 
energy Linda radiates will have 
them revived_ 

"The trick to teaching an 
aerobics class is knowing that as 
a teacher you need to put out 
twice as much as you expect to 
get from your students. For 
example, if you want them to 
kick their legs waist high, you 
need to be kicking at eye level. I 
guess that principle of double the 
effort is true for any type of 
teaching," she said. 

When talking to Linda it's 
easy to see where she gets all her 
energy. She is a multi-faceted 
individual who absorbs every-
thing around her. A conversa-
tion with her may touch on any-
thing from the topic of aerobics 
to metaphysics. 

Sundstrom's background 
shows her diversity. She received 
a scholarship to attend UCLA as 
part of their renowned dance 
company_ While in L.A. she not 
only performed in such famous 
musicals as "Hair," but she also 
did choreography for the Odys-
sey Theater. 

When taking a break from her 
rigorous schedule, Sundstrom 
likes to indulge in reading. "111 
read anything I can get my hands 
on," she said . If she's not soaking 
up Asimov, Tolkien, Ludlum or 
C1avell, she's probably working 
on the science fiction novel which 
she began writing a year ago. 

However, when writers' block 
sets in, Sundstrom may turn to 
watching"StarTrek" or the more 
strenuous pursuit of riding her 
horse, Maxwell. Every weekend 
she practices in Del Mar with 
one of the U_S_ Olympic team's 
equestrian trainers. Sundstrom 
is learning to ride competitively 
for the same reason she's writing 
a science fiction novel - because 
she's always striving for more. 

With her extra supply of 
energy, Sundstrom is able to 
help her students increase their 
own. (Q]

Men's basketball 
tipped off in loss 
By JONA THAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

While it may have been an 
academic and administrative 
boliday this past weekend , there 
was no rest in athletics as the 
UCSD Tritons (3- I) played host 
to the Occidental College Tigers, 
Grand Canyon College Ante-
lopes and UC Santa Cruz Banana 
Slugs (no joke) in UCS1)'s annual 
Triton Tip-off basketball tour-
nament on Nov. 27-28 . 

Coming off a 30-point blow-
out over La Verne College last 
week , the Tritons had their 
adrenalin flowing for their game 
against Occidental. 

Saturday night proved to be a 
bigger challenge for the young 
and still inexperienced Triton 
team. Grand Canyon College, 
who defeated UC Santa Cruz by 
35 points the night before, gave 
UCSD a taste of their own medi-
cine by taking the tournament in 
a I 16-72 victory. 

Senior center Andy Jedynak 
won the opening tip and the 
Tritons took the opportunity to 
put in the first two points of t he 
game. That was the last time the 
Tritons saw a lead . 

UCSD began the game with a 
man-to-man defense. Grand 
Canyon managed to takeadvan-
tage of every opportunity to 
drive to the basket. drawing a 
pair of early fouls on returning 
sophomore forward Andy Wag-
staff and Friday night's star 
Rapp. 

Due primarily to freshman 
guard Tim Rapp 's 22 points, the 
Tritons found themselves with a 
61-36 lead at the half. Rapp fin-
ished with a tournament record 
35 points, inclUding five three-
pointers. Returning senior for-
ward Kevin Stewart added 18 
points of his own, and the Tri-
tons walked over the Tigers, 
107-82. 

In an effort to keep pace with 
the Antelopes , Triton Head 
Coach Tom Marshall called 
timeout with I I :48 remaining in 
the first half to organize a zone

defense. That didn't slow the 
Antelopes down. Instead , t hey 
began shooting from the outside, 
including a number of three-
point shots. The Tritons man-
aged to stay within eight by half-
time, 42-50. 

"Those early fouls by Tim 
[Rapp] and Andy [Wagstaff] 
threw the team out of sync," said 
Coach Marshall.

Grand Canyon wins Tip-off Tourney *********** Look forward 
Continued from pale 15 
defense up a notch and put the 
game away. We are still too 
young of a team to handle defense 
like that." 

The Antelopes controlled the 
ball the entire second half. 
including a six-minute scoring 
drought against the Tritons . 
Ware finished the game with 31 
points and 13 rebounds, earning 
all-tournament Most Valuable 
Player award and the Antelopes 
handed the Tritons their first 

loss of the season, 72-116. 
"One thing that happens in 

tournament s early in the year, 
especially with a group of new 
players , is that unless you can 
take an early lead, you begin to 
feel the tiredness of the night 
before," said Marshall . "As the 
year goes on, we'l get used to 
playing a tough game Friday 
night and then turning right 
around to play tough again Sat-
urday . That just comes with 
experience. "
