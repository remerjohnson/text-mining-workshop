POLITICAL FEVER SWEEPS CAMPUS

Top right: Students at Great Hall celebrate upon the announcement of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama’s victory against 
Republican candidate Sen. John McCain. Top left: As of press time, Obama had taken 349 electoral votes while McCain received 163. Left: 
Student activists demonstrate in support of Proposition 4 at Price Center Nov. 4. Bottom: Proposition 8 sparked protest on Library Walk.

National exit polls suggest that between 21.6 and 23.9 million vot-
ers between the ages of 18 and 25 participated in the election, com-
pared to 2.2 million in 2004. The San Diego County Registrar’s Office 
estimated that 5,000 ballots were cast at on-campus polling stations.

Political science professor Thad Kousser said Obama’s age, back-
ground and message of change made him more appealing to young 
voters than any previous presidential candidate.

“We see this huge increase in youth registration and turnout 
because we have this candidate who is clearly different,” he said. 
“[Obama] is closer in age and appeals to the younger demographic. 
His positions may be similar to others, but he looks different and 
talks different.”  

Kousser added that the McCain campaign’s use of Facebook

Two UCSD biologists announced 
the discovery of a human protein last 
week that rewinds single-stranded 
DNA into its normal double-stranded 
form, potentially preventing critical 
genes — such as those responsible 
for genetic disorders — from form-

ing. Previously, only proteins that 
unwound DNA were known to exist. 

DNA is a double helix with four 
bases in the middle — guanine, cyto-
sine, adenosine and thymine — whose 
sequence determines an organism’s 
genes. The two strands are comple-
mentary to each other, meaning that 
their bases fit together like puzzle 
pieces. 

During replication and gene 
expression, the two strands come 
apart. This process is often facilitat-
ed by a protein called DNA helicase, 
which uses energy stored in the form 
of ATP to pull the strands apart. The 
newly discovered protein, known as 
HepA-Related Protein, does just the 

opposite.
“It is the first time anyone has 

observed DNA actively being 
rewound,” UCSD professor of biology 
and project supervisor Jim Kadonaga 
said. “Often, it has been presumed that 
the strands always find themselves.”

This DNA zipper binds at the fork, 
where double-stranded DNA becomes 
two strands of single-stranded DNA. 
The protein is actually a motor pro-
tein, which means that it travels along 
the DNA and burns ATP as its fuel 
source. 

Scientists working on the project 
stumbled across the new function 
while studying mutations in HARP 
that cause the rare genetic disorder 

Schimke immuno-osseous dyspla-
sia. Symptoms of the disease include 
strokes, congestive heart failure, 
kidney failure and premature death 
among children.

“We assumed that [the new pro-
tein] had a more mundane function,” 
Kadonaga said. “It was actually the 
reverse of that. We found that it binds 
to the fork and burns up ATP. ATP is 
like gasoline for a motor protein. If 
something binds a fork and burns up 
ATP, you would assume it is a helicase. 
Timur, who was doing the experiment, 
had the brilliant idea that it might be 
the reverse of a helicase.” 

A new piece of the 
genetic puzzle gives 
scientists the tools to 
exercise greater control 
over human DNA.

UCSD Extension announced 
plans last week to apply $100,000 
in grants geared toward educa-
tion programs for unemployed San 
Diegans amid the current economic 
crisis. The grants will allow the first 
500 San Diegans who apply to take 
free career-seminar classes at the 
extension. 

According to Ed Abeyta, the  
UCSD Extension registrar and direc-
tor of student services, the seminars 
were designed to instruct students 
in basic, critical career skills in areas 
like personal finance, leadership, 
networking and business etiquette. 
Participants will learn about cor-
porate politics, salary negotiation, 
career changes and creating resumes, 
and develop other necessary abilities 
such as interviewing.

UCSD Extension began distrib-
uting the grants Oct. 30, when the 
offer went into effect; within the 
first five days, 60 grants had been 
handed out.

Participants may choose up to 
three seminars at once, normally 
priced at $45 to $75 each, with limited 
availability. UCSD Extension spokes-
man Henry DeVries said the distri-
bution of these grants will help the 
extension achieve its overall goals.

“We saw that part of our mission 
is helping to train the San Diego 
workforce,” he said. “We think it 
will help people discover jobs that 
are out there that they didn’t know 
about.” 

While the UCSD Extension has 
never before offered these types of 
grants, the decision to do so comes 
on the heels of a plan to promote 
professional education, workforce 
development and public service in 
the community. 

Abeyta also stressed that these 
seminars will allow participants to 
enhance their career skills by inter-
acting with peers. 

“During times like these, being 
able to come together in the class-
room is one of the key components 
[of the program],” Abeyta said. 

According to DeVries, the exten-
sion program’s new efforts to pro-
vide aid are meant to combat harsh 
economic conditions — which have 
left many in the United States strug-
gling to make ends meet — and 
rising unemployment in California 
and San Diego County.

“We saw that we could help the 
local economy by making these 
grants,” DeVries said. “Our mission 
is to have a local impact.”

and other popular media outlets also 
accounted for the spike in youth 
interest. 

Poll clerks at the Revelle College 
voting booth in the Why Not Here? 
Lounge said students began lining 
up 15 minutes before the scheduled 7 
a.m. opening. By midafternoon, all of 
380 English ballots had been admin-
istered, so clerks resorted to using 
Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese 
ballots with English translations.

Raz Autman, a touchscreen inspec-
tor stationed on campus, said students 
seemed more eager to vote than they 
did in past elections, rushing to vote 
between classes and patiently waiting 
in line despite the rain.

“The students seemed more dedi-
cated, geared in, focused — very will-
ing and very concerned about today’s 
society,” he said. “They want change.” 

Other items of chief concern 
on the ballot included California 
Proposition 4, which would have 
delayed abortions for unemancipated 
minors until 48 hours after parental 
notification by a physician; California 
Proposition 8, which outlaws same-
sex marriage; and San Diego County 

Proposition D, which bans alcohol on 
San Diego beaches.

Students protested both proposi-
tions on Library Walk in the weeks 
leading up to the election.

Revelle College freshman Josh King 

was among a group of students on 
Library Walk holding anti-Proposition 
8 signs as voters approached the Price 
Center polling location.

“Now that I am 18, I can take my 

political views to action,” he said. “I 
think this election is a historic elec-
tion both in terms of national and 
state politics. Both the candidates 
were claiming to be agents of change 
and I wanted to impact this change.”

The San Diego Registrar reported 
2,328 ballots cast in San Diego County, 
with 53.18 percent supporting Obama, 
44.51 percent supporting McCain and 
1.64 percent supporting third-party 
candidates. Precinct-specific data 
breaking down candidate support by 
voter demographic will not be released 
until 30 days after the election.

For the first time ever, the A.S. 
Council worked with the city regis-
trar to ensure efficiency and alleviate 
long lines. Councilmembers watched 
the polls throughout Election Day to 
answer questions and ensure that no 
registered voters were turned away.

As the votes were tallied, students 
gathered at various on-campus loca-
tions — including Great Hall, the 
Loft and Porter’s Pub — to watch a 
televised broadcast of the election 
results.

Employment Development 
Department, the state’s unemploy-
ment rate was 7.7 percent, as of 
September of this year. The rate in 
San Diego County has risen signifi-
cantly since last year, and remains 
at 6.4 percent as of September.

The same department estimated 
that 1,300 San Diego jobs were lost 
between August and September. 
This level of unemployment is the 
highest since the mid-1990s, and is 
expected to continue rising over the 
next several months.

NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR FALL 2009

Chapman University is accredited by and is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. 

MASTER OF ARTS
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES

In today’s global environment, expertise in international affairs
is essential to understanding the contemporary world.
The Chapman University Master of Arts in International Studies is a two-year,
full-time, interdisciplinary course of study designed to train students seeking
a career in U.S. Foreign Service, the United Nations (U.N.), U.N.–specialized
agencies, or international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Our program
is well-rounded with academic and practical training, professional and regional
tracks, international internships and hands-on experience for today’s world.

For more information, contact Dr. James Coyle, program director, at 714-744-7074
or coyle@chapman.edu.

To confirm the new suspected 
function, the group created a num-
ber of bubbles; within each, double-
stranded DNA separated into two 
strands and later rejoined as a single 
section of double-stranded DNA. The 
scientists then added HARP, which 
erased those bubbles. 

The team — which includes Timur 
Yusufzai, a postdoctoral fellow in the 
lab — plans to examine the gener-
al cell processes in which the newly 
discovered protein may be involved, 
including DNA repair and general 
maintenance of human genes. They 
also hope to discover more enzymes 
of this class. 

“There are many helicases,” 
Kadonaga said. “There are likely to 
be other reverse helicases like HARP. 
The other thing is that helicases are 
involved in separating DNA strands, 
RNA strands and DNA-RNA hybrids. 
There are probably reverse helicases 
that do the same things. This could be 
the beginning of a whole field.”

Kadonaga’s lab is searching for simi-
lar proteins in other organisms. Another 
reverse helicase was found in fruit flies, 
easy organisms on which to perform 
genetic studies due to their rapid rate 
of reproduction, allowing researchers 
to track the progress of the gene and to 
better understand mutations like those 
that cause the human disease Schimke 
immuno-osseous dysplasia.

“These things don’t happen that 
often — to find something so funda-
mental,” Kadonaga said. “There aren’t 
that many enzymes that alter the struc-
ture of DNA, and to add an entire new 
protein to this category is exciting.”

at chomer@ucsd.edu. 

A swarm of concerned cam-pus community members came forth at last night’s A.S. 
Council meeting, which was again 
dominated by issues of funding for 
the Loft and the Programming Office.  
Students communicated their feelings 
about adding the $2.65 per student per 
quarter provision for the Loft to the 
A.S. activity fee referendum.

“I think that any business should 
employ a sustainable business model,” 
former Physical Sciences Senator 
Rishi Ghosh said.  “A.S. is not here 
to give free money 
to businesses on 
campus.”

Several oth-
ers also expressed 
their disapproval.  
Dorothy Young, 
Chair of the 
Student Affirmative Action Committee, 
told council that the administration 
should run its own referendum.

“There’s a secret boycott on the 
Loft,” Richard Chiem of the Food Co-
op said in addition.  “What I feel from 
the Loft is a sense of wasted money.”  

Two special presentations followed 
the lengthy and impassioned session 
of public input — one from Stephanie 
Usry from the Center for Student 
Involvement and the One Stop Desk, 
and the other from Transportation 
and Parking Services Director Brian 
D’Autremont.

While Usry’s presentation was short 
and sweet, D’Autremont’s was tailed 
by many questions regarding parking 
privileges and shuttle services.

Discussion over adding the Loft 
provision to the A.S. activity fee refer-
endum indicated the transition into the 
second half of the lengthy meeting.

The council scrutinized a draft 
Memorandum of Understanding 
for the Campus Activity Fee for the 
Loft Referendum, which Director 

of University Events Office Martin 
Wollensen sent to the council earlier 
this week.

Former A.S. councilmember Kyle 
Samia urged the council to tighten 
the language stipulated in the memo 
and be ready to bargain for increased 
control over the Loft.

“If I were a councilmember and 
this [memo] was it, I would fail it in 
council,” Samia said of the MoU.  “This 
isn’t student control.  That isn’t shared 
governance, that’s a department using 
our money doing what they want.”

After over two 
hours of debate 
over the language 
of Wollesen’s 
memo, Associate 
Vice President of 
Student Advocacy 
Frank Carroll 

suggested that President Donna Bean 
set up a special committee to discuss 
and revise the memo rather than sim-
ply tabling the discussion of the Loft 
for another week.

Bean subsequently established the 
Special Committee on the Loft which 
some councilmembers gleefully began 
calling “SCLOFT.”

After shelving the issue of the 
Loft for the new special committee 
to grapple with, the council worried 
over their own referendum, and how 
student organizations and program-
ming would be funded. The immediate 
concern fell upon funding for Winter 
Quarter activities.

The council made little progress, 
despite spending over five hours in 
the forum. Many councilmembers also 
voiced frustrations over being unable 
to begin campaigning for the refer-
endum.

“I’m severely disappointed in this 
council’s inability to take action,” AVP 
of College Affairs Jack Cheadle said 
near the end of the meeting.

OPINION
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2008

CONTACT THE EDITOR

opinion@ucsdguardian.org

Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to 

address a few concerns and clarify 
a few issues brought up in the edi-
torial: “Enough Excuses, Get Our 
Referendum Together,” published on 
Oct. 23.

The editorial gives a laundry list 
of reasons for postponing the vote, 
even going so far as to suggest the 
apathy of the A.S. Council. Quite the 
opposite — it is in fact’s the council’s 
invested interest in the referendum 
and its effects on the student body 
as a whole that has resulted in the 
carefully calculated and completely 
appropriate postponement. 

To further clarify the delay, I will 
enumerate a few specific reasons.  

1. The referendum must be 
approved by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue before 
it can be put to a student vote. 
UCSD is the only UC campus that 
requires this approval, as other UC 
campuses have committees with 
student majorities that specifically 
deal with referenda. Rue initially did 
not approve of the the referendum, 
which naturally resulted in neces-

sary refinement and revision.
2. Doing its best to ensure the 

well-being of students, the council 
wanted to take measures such as 
visiting college councils and various 
student organizations to hold dis-
cussions about how the referendum 
would directly affect them. Gauging 
the response of the council and stu-
dent organizations is not only vital 
to running a successful referendum, 
but it would be irresponsible to do 
otherwise.

3. With the addition of the 
Sustainability Resource Center to 
the referendum, the council did not 
comply with University of California 
Office of the President policy 
Section 82.00, as “the referendum 
process shall not be accessible to 
a Registered Campus Organization 
or any student group other than a 
student government.” The SRC was 
just presented to the council this 
quarter and time was needed for the 
council to assess whether or not the 
SRC should be included in the refer-
endum (the decision was yes), find a 
place to put it in the A.S. infrastruc-
ture and draft up a charter. 

To also address Daniel Watt’s letter, 
published Oct. 27, I would once again 
like to reiterate that there has not 
been an increase to the A.S. Campus 

Activity Fee since 1985. The previous 
increases that were referenced, espe-
cially noting the $7 last year that went 
directly to S.P.A.C.E.S, are not part of 
the A.S. operating budget.

One final clarification — the 
council now holds its meetings in 
the Price Center East Forum and not 
the Price Center Ballroom, as noted 
in “Lax Council Can’t Afford This 
Experiment.”

—Emily Chi
A.S. All-Campus Senator, 

Director of Public Relations for the 
Office of the President

Dear Sen. Obama,
I wish to express my pleasure with 

the way you have conducted your 
campaign and look forward to having 
you as our president. In my opinion, 
there is one principal problem facing 
mankind: human overpopulation. It 
is at the crux of all of the world’s 
secondary problems, be they social, 
political, environmental or economic 
— all are exasperated by overpopula-
tion. We need to support the United 
Nations Population Fund and other 
nongovernmental organizations that 

address this issue if we are to survive 
as a species without causing immense 
human suffering. Estimates suggest 
that it would take a mere $30-40 
billion per year to provide contracep-
tion worldwide, and this amount will 
decrease with time due to research 
and more efficient production. This 
small sum would allow women every-
where to choose family size and plan 
for their families’ futures.

It is sufficient to bring our sky-
rocketing population into decline.   

It will give women everywhere 
the freedom of choice. Without it, no 
woman is free. It is imperative for the 
future of the planet.

Open Letter to President-
Elect Barack Obama

The 2008 election saw a huge national shift to the left: The Senate is only a few blue seats 
away from a Democratic superma-
jority, and the Obama camp, under 
substantially liberal ideals, cut itself a 
heaping portion of the electoral pie.

Most of California’s propositions 
were met with a similarly left-wing 
reaction — an initiative requiring 
minors to get parental permission 
before receiving abortions was 
rejected by voters and a call for 
the humane expansion of farm-ani-
mal cage space was overwhelmingly 
passed. It seems, however, that even 
though we can potentially damage 
California’s egg industry so that 
our poor chickens can turn around 
in their cages, we can’t even con-
sider those who make up the large 
homosexual population of our state 
human enough to grant them the 
right to legally marry.  

The gay-marriage debate has 
been in and out of the public dis-
course for quite some time now; just 
last May, the California Supreme 
Court overturned the former ban 
so that hundreds of couples could 
tie the knot. Of course, this set the 
churches into a rage, because their 
sacred tradition was apparently 
being trodden upon by some other 
societal species (of course, to prove 
this, they’ve conveniently selected 
only the parts of the Bible condemn-
ing same-sex love, ignoring all sorts 
of other out-dated philosophies 
championed in the pages of text 
surrounding this decree). And now, 

in an amendment to the state con-
stitution that not only violates the 
age-old separation of church and 
state but also manages to contradict 
every other freedom-of-choice ideal 
so largely supported this season, 
Proposition 8 officially defines mar-
riage as the union between one man 
and one woman.

When President-elect Barack 
Obama took the California and 
United States popular vote this 
Tuesday, there was a hope in the air 
we haven’t felt for years. America has 
taken an epic step forward not only 
in finally admitting and looking to 
change the failures of a conserva-
tive administration like George W. 
Bush’s, but in electing someone to the 

presidency who, a century ago, would 
have been essentially unable to vote 
because of his skin color. 

This shocking move from one 
of the Union’s most progressive 
regions — during a time when the 
rest of United States is making such 
a dramatic push for equality — is a 
blatant step backward in our path 
toward building a perfect nation 
for all.

In 2000, a similar measure 
passed by a 23 percent margin. Less 
than a decade later, Proposition 8 
passed by a much narrower 5 per-
cent. The supporters of this hateful 
measure best look around — times 
are changing. Within our lifetimes, 
all adults will rightly enjoy the free-

dom to marry whomever they love, 
and Proposition 8 will be nothing 
more than a sloppy mark on our 
constitution, as foolish and fleeting 
as Prohibition.

Higher education officials around the country are ecstatic following Tuesday’s 
election results, and not just because 
President-elect Barack Obama has 
plans to reform student-loan pro-
grams, establish a tuition tax credit 
in exchange for service, offer new 
investments in research and expand 
science and technology programs.

Voters nationwide made clear 
their support for higher-education 

initiatives, including rejecting a pro-
posal in Massachusetts that would 
have eliminated that state income 
tax and in turn dealt a crippling 
blow to the state’s education sector, 
which relies heavily on income taxes 
for support. In New Mexico, vot-
ers approved two bonds with major 
implications for higher education: 
Bond C, which delegates $40.5 mil-
lion to universities for health facili-
ties, and Bond D, which supports a 

new $19-million arts facility for New 
Mexico State University. Voters in 
Arkansas and Maryland approved 
lottery measures whose profits will 
help bolster education programs, and 
Montana voters said yes to property-
tax levies to support the University 
of Montana.

With the University of California, 
California State University and 
California Community College sys-
tem in such dire need of assistance 

(student fees continue to increase 
year after year while state support is 
dropping), Californians should learn 
from citizens of other states and take 
education matters into their own 
hands next time the ballot comes 
around, conducting and bankrolling 
higher-education initiatives. Maybe 
then California colleges wouldn’t be 
constantly pleading for funding and 
students and administrators could 
breathe a little easier.

After a months-long wait, being bombarded daily by poll fluc-tuations and learning more 
about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s (lack 
of) qualifications than we could’ve ever 
wanted (but even I have to admit, 
she is kind of hot), Americans finally 
stepped up to the plate on Tuesday 
and elected Democratic candidate Sen. 
Barack Obama of Illinois president, 
ending nearly a decade of Republican 
rule at the White House and launching 

our country in a vastly new direction 
— both in the domestic and foreign-
affairs arenas.

Thank whoever it is up there that 
he won, because our economy — most 
specifically, our financial sector — is 
in shambles of epic proportion, Social 
Security in on the brink of collapse, 
we continue to lose Americans sol-
diers in Iraq and Afghanistan, domes-
tic health-care policy is in desperate 
need of an overhaul and the rest of 
the world really doesn’t like us. And 
while Obama definitely isn’t some sort 
of magic elixir for every problem we 
face, his ideas are certainly different 
from the bushel of crap our current 
president has been spewing, and pretty 
much anything is better than what 
we’re doing now, right?

But while the country was focusing 
so hard on the presidential race — 
learning vocabulary terms like swing 
state, troopergate, bailout plan and Joe 
the Plumber — and being reminded 
just what it is that the Electoral College 
does, it was the statewide races that 
slipped largely under the radar, attract-
ing far less attention despite the fact 
that several of them dealt with issues 
that have far-reaching implications.

I’m not talking about the House 
and Senate races, either, even though 
so many Democrats prevailed, some 
even wresting control from once 
unquestionably reliable Republican 
strongholds such as North Carolina 
and Colorado — an incredible tran-
sition of power that will definitely 
bolster Obama’s policy plans. I’m 
talking about statewide propositions, 
measures and initiatives, which many 
times deal with hot-button issues, 
oftentimes propose ridiculous con-
cepts that are rightfully struck down 
or upheld by voters and sometimes 
shock the nation with their outcomes 
(notable examples being Oregon’s 
1994 Ballot Measure 16, which legal-
ized physician-assisted suicide for ter-
minally ill patients, and California’s 
1996 Proposition 215, which legalized 
marijuana use as treatment for certain 
medical ailments).

Both of these propositions were 
groundbreaking and led other states 
to follow suit; many states have since 
passed medical marijuana laws, the 
most recent being Michigan, where 
voters approved medical cannabis 
this year. Washington state voters this 
year also approved an initiative simi-
lar to their southern neighbor’s Ballot 
Measure 16. 

It’s important for voters in all states 
to pay attention to such propositions 
because it’s not uncommon for them

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

to cause a shockwave that reverberates 
through the rest of the country, leading 
to similar propositions in other states.

And after some of this year’s ballot 
measures, voters across the country 
would be unwise to write off the results 
without seriously thinking about the 
consequences of the outcomes and 
whether they should expect a simi-
lar proposition arising in their states 
sometime in the future.

Major issues this year included gay 
marriage, rights of the unborn, suspen-
sion of the income tax and affirmative 
action, all of which produced interest-
ing results that demand us as indi-
viduals to critically think about their 

implications.
In Colorado, voters rejected a 

proposal that would have defined a 
human life at conception, and voters 
in South Dakota rejected an initiative 
that would have prohibited abortion 
in all cases except rape, incest and 
when the mother’s life was in danger. 
In California, voters did not approve a 
proposition that would have required 
parental notification for minors seek-
ing an abortion. Such results tell us as 
a nation that abortion rights remain 
of fundamental concern, with notori-
ously blue states like California in step 
with purple states like Colorado and 
red states like South Dakota.

But in addition to issues that 

demonstrate national solidarity, we 
should note measures such as that 
of Arkansas’ Initiative 1, which bans 
gay couples from adopting children, 
and Massachusetts’ Question 2, 
which decriminalizes marijuana pos-
session. Both measures passed with 
comfortable margins, and undoubt-
edly those issues will spread to other 
states. (Personally, I think the people 
of Arkansas are absolutely ridiculous 
while Massachusetts voters rock.)

So while you rejoice in Obama’s 
victory, be careful not to lose sight of 
other issues snaking their way across 
America. That way, if they ever appear 
on your state’s ballot, you’ll be pre-
pared to make an informed decision.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

BY GLORIA WUBy Gloria Wu • Contributing Writer

GETTING CONNE
T he typical college student can log on to Facebook to receive notice of a friend’s forgotten birthday, nomi-

nate Stephen Colbert for president and 
exchange electronic bumper stickers to 

display on a profile page. Now, using 
the Veechi application on Facebook, 
students from UCSD, UC Berkeley 
and UC Davis can also search for 

instructor ratings, reviews and grade 
distributions at their colleges.

Veechi Corporation launched 
its beta Facebook application on 
Oct. 26 to gain recognition and get 

feedback. Less than a week later, 
Veechi had amassed over 1,000 users 

and has continued to grow steadi-
ly. Additionally, the corporation has 

been in talks with with the UCSD Career 
Services Center for its first partnership.
Joining the many college success tools 

available to provide students with access to 
academic resources online, Veechi compiles 
supplements provided by programs such as 
RateMyProfessors.com, PostYourTest.com and 
UCSD’s Course and Professor Evaluations, 
which can all be obtained instantaneously 
with a few clicks of the mouse.

“We are leveraging the power of Facebook 
and [harnessing] that power of the social net-
work to the advantage of the students,” Veechi 
founder Abraham Shafi said.

With the anticipation of launching Veechi.
com — a Web site independent from the 
Facebook application — by Spring Quarter, 
the site’s UCSD campus representative Travis 
Lowe began searching for a partner to assist 
the site in facilitating career and internship 
information into their available services.

“When I walked into [the Career Services 
Center], the response was warm and interest-
ed, so we decided to move forward with UCSD 
first,” Lowe said. “The reason we decided to 
start the discussion here was that it would give 
us a background in how we would work with 
other campuses in the future.”

Located in Silicon Valley, the company 
is the brainchild of Shafi, who met Lowe at 
Diablo Community College before they trans-
ferred to separate universities. As the chief 
persuasion officer, Shafi gears Veechi to adapt 
to its target users; he promotes and recruits 
for the company. 

Veechi’s goal is to help students conquer 
college. The name itself originated from a 
Greek advertisement that caught Shafi’s eye 
when he visited New York City. The slogan 
of the advertisement was “Veni, Vidi, Vici,” 
the illustrious Latin phrase uttered by Julius 
Caesar that translates to “I came, I saw, I con-
quered.” The Veechi team plays on that phrase 
by embellishing the Facebook application with 

A fter midnight in the United States capital, when most of the nation was glued to their televisions and the Nov. 5 early morning 
editions of the Washington Post were hitting the 
racks, I found myself, a Republican, in a cheering 
mob of Democrats. 

Strangers met in the streets like old friends, 
hugging, clapping and crying together. If Oprah 
hadn’t been at Grant Park in Chicago she could 
have been leaning on someone next to me. A 

celebration of success poured out from D.C. bars, 
crowded the Washington streets and rallied in 
front of the White House. The future of the next 
four years had finally been decided with the elec-
tion of Barack Obama. 

UCDC students, usually off work on 
Tuesdays for our research seminar, filed out of 
the classroom on Election Day either headed to 
the streets to gauge the reaction of the city as the 
polls came in or to the Mayflower Hotel, where 
the Democratic National Committee was hold-
ing its election night party. The Obama sup-
porters — nearly everyone in the room — wore 
their buttons and T-shirts, excited and feverish 
in anticipation. The few Sen. John McCain (R-
Ariz.) supporters, weary of the insults they’d 
been bearing, gathered together to make a trip 
to the liquor store; they’d be drinking early.

CELEBRATING 
DEMOCRACY IN 
THE NATION’S 

CAPITAL
M eet the one restaurant worth blowing your paycheck on. It’s a gastronomical explo-sion, a dedicated-to-freshness haven of 
hearty, down-to earth dishes epitomizing multi-
cultural Californian cuisine. Unlike often-over-
priced, blandish La Jolla fare, it is 100 percent 
worth its upscaled prices.

Whisknladle (pronounced wisk-en-lay-del) 
redefines “fresh” — literally. When owner Arturo 
Kassel and executive chef Ryan Johnston took 
over in 2006, they changed the originally named 
“Fresh Seafood Restaurant” to “Fresh[er],” reflect-
ing their emphasis on serving only fresh, organic 
ingredients. Last January, the duo decided to 
remodel the eatery again to better match their 
philosophy: “You get out of  the pot, what you put 
into the pot.” 

Kassel and Johnston weren’t kidding. They take 
back-to-basics to the extreme, using only garden-
fresh ingredients from three local organic farms. 
From baking bread and smoking pork to churn-
ing ice cream and making mustard, Whisknladle 
chefs craft a multilayered tasting experience akin 
to home-cooked food from a master chef — e.g. if 
Wolfgang Puck was your mom. And if the celeb-
rity chef, like Kassel and Johnston, served only 
microbrews, hand-picked all wines (most under 
$60) and hand-built a four-foot by four-foot 
cedar-lined meat-curing room. 

This custom method of preparation is reflected 
in the balanced, tapas-style menu, which changes 
due to Kassel and Johnston’s “commitment to stay 
seasonal and cook on a whim.” The four-person-
worthy cutting board, a selection of savory house 
cured meats and flaky, nutty cheeses is a must-
have. A trio of butternut squash ravioli feels sur-
prisingly hearty, filled with creamy yellow squash 
and topped with smoky roasted chestnuts and 
sage. The slow-cooked lamb osso bucco almost 
melts off the bone, accented with rich coco beans 
and colorful mustard greens. Each bite is compli-
mented by a sip of lemon-and-cucumber flavored 
water, and Whisknladle’s fresh-baked French-
style bread is always abundant.

It’s Whisknladle’s attention to detail that ulti-

mately seals the deal. The understated-yet-
classy patio setup gains points for its scaled-
back touches: the single hanging lightbulbs, the 
wrought-iron woven chairs, the heated over-
head lamps. Earthy tones, simple white plating 
and new full-bar seating brings its amenities 
to a 360. Along with the impeccable service 
— waiters don’t pester you every moment, 
but fade in and out appropriately — there 
can be no possible rating but 10 out of 10 for 
ambiance.

Despite La Jolla prices in the range of 
$31 to $50 for a three-course meal — with 
appetizers ($8 to $18), entrees ($16 to $30) 
and dessert ($10) — Whisknladle proves 
its worth with local organic ingredients, 
thoughtful homestyle cooking and a taste-
ful, cozy atmosphere.

a Roman theme. At the top of the 
Web page, a small piece of Roman 
trivia is highlighted and changes 
every time the user refreshes the 
page. To draw people in, the team 
has developed a ranking system for 
each time a user writes a review or 
invites friends to join the applica-
tion. The user will then be given 
electronic Denarii, or Roman cur-
rency, which will eventually accu-
mulate. The amount of Denarii a 
user has will determine status in 
the Veechi community, which ranks 
from citizen to emperor. Surprises 
are promised for those at the top 
ranks.

However, students are less pre-
occupied with their Veechi status 
and more concerned with retrieving 
reviews about courses and instruc-
tors.

“I don’t like the [ranking] sys-
tem but I guess it helps that it has 
both reviews and grade distribu-
tions,” Revelle College freshman 
Kailin Duan said. “[Veechi] is pretty 
much the same as PickAProf.com. I 
don’t think it’s completely necessary 
to use, since it gets its information 
from other sources.”

Veechi provides the names of the 
toughest and easiest instructors on 
campus, including the grade ranges 
given by each instructor. Moreover, 
students can add reviews and rat-
ings of courses that they have taken 
in the past and view other students’ 
opinions on courses they are inter-
ested in taking in the future. The 
application also helps students find 
and get to know their classmates.

Currently, the beta application is 
performing its most basic functions: 
it is providing students with an aid 
to plot their academic courses. The 
Veechi team is focusing primarily 
on marketing strategies to spread 
the word across campuses. Veechi 
uses information already made pub-

lic by UCSD and relies on its users 
to keep it updated. The existing 
information is sparse, because the 
corporation is relying on resources 
already available for its users, some-
thing it hopes to change with pro-
spective partnerships.

“I think this could be a poten-
tially unique social platform that 
will be very positive for students,” 
Associate Director of the UCSD 
Career Services Center Craig 
Schmidt said after an initial meeting 
with Shafi. “There’s a lot of potential 
there to assist students in providing 

key resources.”
Veechi plans to launch its pro-

gram at every UC and California 
State University campus this winter.

“By the end of the year, we hope 
to reach the entirety of college sys-
tems in California, barring private 
schools,” Lowe said. Shafi expects 
that Veechi will continue to expand 
nationally and then internationally 
as long as the application remains 
relevant among college students.

At the moment, Lowe said 
Veechi is biding its time and wait-
ing to receive results from the three 
schools. He has been the driv-
ing force behind the negotiations 
between Veechi and the Career 

Services Center.
Veechi’s reputation currently 

relies mostly on word of mouth and 
Facebook invitations, but the team 
is working on buzz advertisements 
as well. 

Lowe and Shafi met with the 
UCSD Career Advisor Directors on 
Nov. 5 to discuss how they could 
utilize the Career Services Center’s 
resources.

Once Lowe and Shafi have gen-
erated enough users and informa-
tion, they will begin implementing 
the next step in their plan: provid-
ing employment opportunities for 
college students. They plan to use 
Veechi to help students make career 
decisions by choosing classes that 
could best prepare students for their 
desired career and then help them 
find appropriate employers. Veechi 
will help place students in intern-
ships or extracurricular activities 
that will assist them in making the 
most of their college years. Students 
would be able to contact employ-
ers through their Facebook applica-
tion, while employers could seek 
students from a separate account 
on the Veechi homepage; currently, 
this page only operates as a front 
that directs traffic to the Facebook 
application.

This is where their partnership 
with Career Services Centers on 
various college campuses will play 
a key role. However, at this point 
the UCSD Career Services directors 
say that it is premature to determine 
whether the center will partner with 
Veechi.

“At this point it’s too early to have 
any other kind of proclamation, 
but we certainly want to encourage 
them,” Schmidt said. “They have 
struck us as very creative and have 
definite possibilities.”

I went to work late that afternoon, 
deciding to stay at the MSNBC studios 
until every poll closed. But it was worth 
forgoing the early bar-time festivities to 
get updates through the flurry of news 
wires and NBC staff e-mails. When the 
wire came through that Obama was 
the 44th president of the United States, 
the information was listed as “hot” and 
embargoed by the network until the 
appropriate release time; I immediately 
called my mom, my roommates and a 
few friends from back home. As each 
person reported the outcome to which-
ever bar, club or party they were attend-
ing, I could hear cheers.

I tried to leave the studio around 
11:30 p.m. to join my friends for 
Obama’s victory speech at Hawk ’n’ 
Dove, a local bar on Capitol Hill, but my 
producer was convinced that none of 
the interns should walk back and after 
having my arm twisted, I was driven 
home in a black town car reserved 
for NBC’s big wigs. While the driver 
scrutinized me in the rearview mirror 
— trying to determine if I was related to 
an anchor or sleeping with one of them 
— I watched the crowds outside in the 
streets chanting, cheering and honking 
all the way to the White House. By the 
time I reached Pennsylvania Avenue it 
was so packed with people and vehicles 
that I had no choice but to walk. 

In front of the White House, my 
plans changed again. A small crowd 
outside the gates, holding Obama signs, 
yelled for President George W. Bush to 
start packing. “If you need help, Bushie, 
let me know, because you’ve got to 
go!” one woman shouted through the 
metal bars. A flood of people, marching 
directly from the DNC party down the 
street, made their way into the area.

Anticipating a large crowd, secu-
rity fences had been erected to section 
off Lafayette Park and the main gate, 

funneling the crowd in and around 
— but not close to — the driveway to 
the president’s front door. The snipers 
seemed to multiply in the minutes that 
I greedily snapped pictures, but there 
was no tension between the crowds and 
the police. I watched a group of men 
get overfriendly in their celebration, 
pushing and prodding the rest of the 
crowd, and I hurriedly moved out of the 
way expecting fists. When a few police 
officers arrived on the scene moments 
later, they exited their vehicles and after 
brief hesitation began hollering right 
alongside the revelers.

As the minutes wore on and Obama’s 
speech came to a close, a crowd that 
had once been 50 became 5,000, pep-
pered with teens and elderly; blacks and 
whites; high-ranking suited officials and 
average Joes in T-shirts. News stations, 
with bright lights and boom sticks, cap-
tured the entire event for the world to 
see; most of the reporters were foreign. 
The world was watching and the crowd 
loved it as they yelled and pumped their 
fists for the cameras. Eventually, one 
man started to sing “Na na na na, na na 
na na, hey, hey, hey, good-bye!” and the 
entire crowd serenaded President Bush 
until the lights of the White House were 
finally extinguished.

At the back of the park, cars slowed 
so that both driver and passengers could 
roll down their windows and shout in 
approval, earning high-fives from cou-
rageous crowd members who stole into 
the intersection. It was as if each person 
in the car, or on the sidewalk, or in the 
crosswalk, were personally responsible 
for bringing about change. Even I, a 
skeptic fiercely loyal to McCain, real-
ized that there’s something to say about 
a bombardment of car horns synchro-
nizing with the crowd’s cheer, “Yes we 
can,” and so I did what felt right — I 
danced along with the beat of the song 
the masses were singing.

recordings

C ritically lauded New York quintet O’Death has released its second LP of farmhouse creepers just in time for the Halloween festivities. True 
to their name — which puts a gothic spin on the 
Irish-American surname — Broken Hymns, Limbs 
and Skin is a full-blown hoedown held in the quiet-
est of nights by insomniatic old folks with perdition 
on their minds. 

Frenzied fiddles and dissonant banjos — pierced 
by Greg Jamie’s bluegrass chanting — scratch and 
thud their way across bipolar tracks that update 
mood and tempo at every turn. It’s not hard to see 
past the frenetic rockers’ rural influences and cor-
ral them more toward the psychoward — but that’s 
exactly what they’re going for. 

O’Death’s lyrics further kin them to horror-movie 
soundtracks. “Mountain Shifts” hears Jamie gently 

purring, “Her hair lays violent/ Dead in the streets”; 
goosebumps spread like wildfire as he urges all with 
the malevolence of a guiltless murderer, “I hope that 
she’s peaceful/ Wherever her body may be.” The grim 
Hawthornian hubbub reaches near-laughable levels, 
but is pulled off with such honest fervor that we’re all 
but spellbound by the hysteria.

Halloween may be over, but a warning to all 
you hipster pussies out there: Don’t listen to Broken 
Hymns at night. No matter how much we may roll 
our eyes at its morbid fascinations, O’Death’s sopho-
more record has us jumping at shadows — clearly, 
the stuff of nightmares. 

O’Death will play live at the Casbah on Nov. 23.

“Days and Clouds”
Woody Allen isn’t the only one who can 

depict the feuding trials of a bourgeois couple 
with daring gall. Silvio Soldini’s “Days and 
Clouds” is close behind with the story of Elsa 
and Michele, whose middle-aged marriage 
begins to tear on the jagged rocks of Italy’s 
economic crisis. The glamorous city of Genoa 
is cast in a more humble light, its dirty streets 
reflecting the machismo-stunting of a husband 
suddenly faced with the unfamiliar hardships 
of unemployment. The couples’ tailspin into 
poverty and depression transcends its setting 
to call into question self-worth and the value 
of marriage. (EG)

O ne hot 8 a.m., recovering from a reggaeton hangover the size of Patagonia, I made the biweekly trek up one of Valparaíso’s steepest 
hills to the vocational high school where I taught 
my broken English to Chilean schoolboys — uni-
formed hooligans on a career path into construc-
tion, plumbing or air conditioning — without the 
slightest interest in anything but tripping each other 
in the aisles and scoring my MSN screen name.

It was likes/dislikes day. I like hip-hop, I wrote 
on the chalkboard. Me gusta heep-hope, they 
repeated, not forgetting (heaven forbid) to make 

fun of my accent for a good 10 minutes beforehand. 
As I fought the roar of restless youth to impart my 
university-scrambled understanding of an impossi-
bly awkward tongue onto unhearing ears, one par-
ticular gentleman — with re-hardened pink candy 
in the cracks of his teeth — proposed, roughly 
translated, that we take a fucking load off and do 
something cool already. 

The children proceeded to make the executive 
decision stop learning English — don’t blame them, 
really — and instead treat me to one of the coolest 
somethings I’ve witnessed in my short lifetime: an in-

Nebraska dance-punkers the Faint spazz through SoCal with their familiar tin-can-Nintendo

Newly rinsed and dented on 2008’s Fasciinatiion, their pioneering electro-goth remains intact 
and joyously depraved. Yeah, we’re gonna sweat off the week’s political grime, hair matted with 
someone else’s grease and choking on Dance Macabre freakouts — “Agenda suicide/ the drones 
work hard before they die” — before the keyboard waves reach sublimity and we sink into the 
groping masses; so dress in gear that won’t mind being clawed and/or shredded. (SM)

Ras_G & the Afrikan Space Program
■ Ghetto Sci-Fi
POOBAH RECORDS

I f you’re one of the few familiar with Ras_G and the Afrikan Space Program, you’ll know to expect the unexpected from Ghetto Sci-Fi, his 
first official LP. With snap-crackle-popping and 
jazz-inspired feedback, the urban scientist knocks 
skulls open with new dimensions of beats and sonic 
experimentation.

Operating out of Space Base 2031 — his extrater-
restrial beat fortress in the heart of South Central, 
L.A. — Ras’ flow feels like a 3 a.m. blunt: hazy and 
a little off. Building on a handful of earlier record-
ings, Sci-Fi showcases a stylistic range unseen in 
past works, orchestratng a stream-of-consciousness 
beat journey — from spaced-out lo-fi to straight-up 
headbangers, to plain old weird and wonderful noise. 
No two tracks are alike, and Ras_G moves seamlessly 
through his time-suspended otherworld.

The funky Rastafarian already has plans for a 
follow-up on Flying Lotus’ gargantuan Brainfeeder 
Records, tentatively titled Brotha From Anotha 
Planet, promising even more ethereal swerves. 
Clearly, Ras is here, and people are listening. As if his 
old 10- and 12-inchers and EPs were practice jam 
sessions, Sci-Fi sees him ready for the playing field. 
As the Martian himself explains, “Some say sky’s the 
limit, but I say that space is the limit ... With this 
record I reached to the sky, so with my next record I 
seek the endless void.” The Afrikan Space Program 
is in full blast — tell an Earthling near you. 

Ras_G & the Afrikan Space Program will play 
live at the Echoplex in Los Angeles on Nov. 7.

ART AS REALITY
MIDDLE-AGED DREAMER CASTS HIMSELF INTO FANTASY FOR CLASSIC KAUFMAN MIND-BENDER 

E ach script penned by Kafka-esque screenwright Charlie Kaufman seems to be the expansive appendix of its 
predecessor — most famously, “Adaptation” 
borrowed the making of his own “Being John 
Malkovich” to re-tell Susan Orlean’s novel 
The Blood Orchid — an evolution of one art 
project into another, constantly deconstruct-
ing philosophical and theoretical corollaries.

This time around, it’s classical theater 
(the acoustic ancestor of Hollywood cinema) 
that focuses Kaufman’s directorial debut, 
the awe-inspiring “Synecdoche, NY.” Highly 
ambitious and erudite, the film splices elec-
tric ideas — such as a pipe bomb in a po-mo 
pastiche — with the life story of one dying 
soul, who hopes to leave a lasting legacy of 
the genius nestled somewhere within him. 

Theatrical director Caden Cotard (Phillip 
Seymour Hoffman) arrives at midlife crisis, 

trapped in a life lacking ephemeral luster 
and sapped of spontaneity by a pervasive 
Schenectady suburbia. On top of all that, 
he’s wedded to a struggling artist (Catherine 
Keener) who suffers from repressed Anne-
Sexton fantasies of murdering him — which 
doesn’t much help his marriage. Making 
matters worse, his therapist is more con-
cerned with promoting her New York Times 
bestseller than actually providing mental 
remedy.

But there is one sign of hope: the coquett-
ish and buxom box-office ginger Hazel 
(Samantha Morton), who flirts unabashedly 

with Cotard. Yet just when things start to 
look up, in that extramarital affair sort of way 
— they jackknife asunder. 

When diagnosed with an unknown 
condition that systematically paralyzes his 
organs, Cotard cuts loose from his wife 
and daughter. Shortly after, he receives a 
MacArthur Genius grant — seemingly unde-
servedly — that allows him to carry out a 
bizarre and elaborate dream of orchestrating 
a massive magnum opus, set in an enormous 
New York City warehouse that could double 
as an urban aviary.

Meanwhile, his affair falls apart, and for 
the next 30-odd years we watch Cotard 
alchemize his own dwindling life (and the 
myriad lives of others) into art, until the line 
between the two becomes blurred beyond

THURSDAY,NOVEMBER 6, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  7

class freestyle competition between the most ambitious 
MCs of the bunch (who had apparently found some free 
time between air-conditioning cram sessions). With even 
more agility than it took to kick their soccer ball around 
the school basketball court — and more darty grace than 
I’ve seen in any rapper’s flow, anywhere, before or since 
— these kids blew this sour critic’s standards right out of 
the water. Granted, the Spanish language provides almost 
limitless opportunity for rhyme considering practically 
any verb can be conjugated to sound like another, but 
their shit was ridiculous by any measure.

A scattering of “producers” had gathered between 
the competitors, some breathing into hollowed fists 
for a simple beatbox, but one in particular standing at 
attention with a metal-spiral notebook, a single plas-
tic pen poised above and the devil’s grin all over his 

flushed little face. Right there, along that coiled silver 
spine — as the MCs dove in, adam’s-apple drumsets 
right behind them — I witnessed the most simple, 
most beautiful of all Latin beats: the unrelenting trot 
of cumbia’s clean-then-filthy, nasty-then-nice plunk-
chicka, plunk-chicka, wrist flicking its pen-strument to 
climb up and pummel down the metal rungs, recalling 
every Mexican beater I’d ever passed with its windows 
down and every summer I’d spent at my dad’s construc-
tion site with the radio on blow-out.

Leading up to this moment, a self-satisfying exploita-
tion of the least thought-requiring dance music on Earth 
— that royal reggaeton — had apparently left my Hiatus-
cranny craving something that made me grit and wince 
a little. Fortunately, the same oversized, underseatbelted 

HORNY SLAPSTICK DUO CATERS 
TO NEW BATCH OF COLLEGE KIDS 

By Amanda Martinek
Contributing Writer

M isfits Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Sean William Scott) have quite possibly the easiest job in the 
world: they visit schools and tell kids to 
“Just say ‘No’ to drugs,” forcing them to 
down copious amounts of their nucle-
ar horse-piss Minotaur Energy Drink, 
instead. 

“Wet Hot American Summer” direc-
tor David Wain’s “Role Models” trims 
down on cult humor to crowd-please 
the mainstream, but remains savvy 
enough to make formulaic fart humor 
wholly enjoyable. His sex-obsessed duo 
nosedive into fantastically crude slap-
stick after Danny quenches a couple 
piss-packs too many, crashing their 
novelty company car in a faux-DUI 
bender. The young men are dealt an 
ultimatum: 30 days in the state pen 
or 150 hours of community service at 
Sturdy Wings, a local altruistic men-
toring program for kids who certainly 
need it. 

Turns out a couple of sex-crazed 
dropouts don’t make the best mentors. 
Danny is paired with Augie (Christopher 
Mintz-Plasse), better known as McLovin’ 
from “Superbad,” who is once again 
typecast as every high school’s awkward 
roller-backpack kid. Living as a life-size 
avatar of his Dungeons and Dragons’ 
warrior character the mythic land of 
Zanthia, Augie’s extracurricular activi-

ties include battling himself and mak-
ing out with imaginary elves. Wheeler, 
the typical “Animal House” goof, gets 
paired with the adorable Ronnie (Bobb’e 
J. Thompson), a young, troublesome 
class clown who’s determined to get rid 
of his previous slew of do-gooder big 
brothers. 

Fanning the eccentricity, Sturdy 
Wings is run by ex-blow aficionado Gayle 
Sweeny (Jane Lynch), whose   experience 
in delivering awkward sexual daggers 
of awkward sexual comments, as dem-
onstrated in 2005’s “The 40-Year-Old 
Virgin,” comes in handy. She promptly 
asserts that she’s not here to service 
the community — she’s here to “service 
these young boys.” 

“Models” draws a lot of its laughs 
with a typical arsenal of post-“American 
Pie” absurdity, peppered with the occa-
sional Judd-Apatow aside. Witty joust-
ings, tasteless quips and ever the sly 
sexual innuendo follow a well-perfo-
rated pattern, generally one-upping 
lowbrow college humor like “Scary 
Movie 4” by triggering the never-stat-
isfied pleasure centers of horny teens 
everywhere.

Though its actors inevitably fulfill 
their self-stereotypes — Paul Rudd is 
the jerk, Sean William Scott the goof-off 
and Christopher Mintz-Plasse the uber-
dweeb — “Models” still throws around 
enough pop-culture references and droll 
wisecracks to have us rooting for its anti-
heros until the sidesplitting finish. 

Theater Mimics Life Mimics ‘Synecdoche’
recognition.

Kaufman has a penchant for tabling our assump-
tions of reality, and “Synecdoche” certainly peels 
the wallpaper around us with a razor quill. Ambling 
along the sidewalk outside the theater warehouse, 
Cotard mentions his affection for the production title 
“Simulacrum.” Although brief and seemingly uneces-
sary, the philosophical allusion is one of the director’s 
many keyholes into his greater vision.

Drawing on the postmodern ideas of Jean 
Baudrillard, Cotard attempts to mimic reality so insis-
tantly that his theatrical replica of New York eventually 
replaces the city itself — a contemporary fetish our 
generation perpetuates with MMORPGs, reality TV 
and practically every other form of media. As Cotard 
boxes himself within a staged imitation of life, he 
eventually finds himself in a storyboard of actors who 
know what he’ll do before he even does it — a reality 
more realistic than the outside world. 

After hearing Forest Whitaker’s acceptance speech 

at the Academy Awards two years ago, it seemed that 
maybe there was something more to acting than mere-
ly mimicking emotive expressions. As a film filled with 
well-loved celebrities portraying unadorned Juilliard 
versions of themselves, one of “Synecdoche”’s most 
endearing profundities is its tribute to an actor’s divine 
ability to reflect a universal humanity.

Employing a tone not unlike that of magical 
realism, Kaufman’s work exudes a mature style and 
aesthetic creativity lacking in modern American 
cinema’s infatuation with blockbusters and placat-
ing comedies. Although many audiences will prefer 
his surrealist escapades and kitsch tales of love lost 
(“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”), there’s 
something to be said for a film that novelly confronts 
one of humanity’s timeless tragedies, in which we’re 
all passing strangers with a desire to leave our mark 
on the world. 

Yet, as Kaufman proves with Emersonian slant, 
perhaps there is something to embrace besides our-
selves — or the selves we assume to be our own.

THURSDAY,NOVEMBER 6, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  9

carload of Chileans that whisked me nightly through Valparaíso’s 
official tour of ’ton (who called themselves las FARP in an alcoholic 
play on the revolutionary forces), had even more to offer within my 
next genre fixation, spinning a between-bar road soundtrack of the 
most well-loved plunk-chickas on the continent. Grupo La Noche’s 
“Es El Amor” and “Lastima” swelled in accordians and teary-eyed 
trumpets — the boys even used air-drawings to underscore the 
heartbreak — and ’90s ass-men Amar Azul sung of the most out-of-
this-world mini-skirted hips they’d ever seen shake to the merengue. 
Even if my hips had no natural way of moving like that (especially 
under three other bodies in the way-way-back), I got the shoulder 
switchback down to a trade.

But by far the most-spun party music by our passenger-seat DJ 
— the roof-pounding Felipe, metalhead by day, king of cumbia by 
night — could be found in the glorious Dumpster dives of Argentine 
group Supermerk-2, modern-day pioneers of shantytown cumbia. 
What are the chances that the local expert on the most excellent 
of trashy dance cuts, something I in another lifetime might have 
devoted an entire thesis to, would be my personal babysitter?

The Supermerk-2 shout in jokey prehistoric grunts that can’t 
have seen a day of training, mouthing off about the 3 a.m. quest 
for more booze, driving a garbage truck (unless there’s some awe-
some metaphor I’m missing here), being super horny and wanting 
your mom. They throw out all instruments they couldn’t find in 
the local party store, bulging their eyeballs, tweeting on whistles 
and honking the kazoo until our eardrums develop a case of the 
hiccups, scribbling that waxy mess all over a downbeat — PLUNK-
chicka — wrapped so close in cymbals and notebook spirals that 
we’re all but fly-trapped in a web of bungee. They prove once and 
for all that a Latin beat will always win the dance-off — more street, 
more spontaneous, more elastic, far more intoxicated and, most 
importantly, shaken to by the sexiest stuffs on Earth.

Little Joy
■ Little Joy

Two scruffy guys in Ray-Bans and their cute female counterpart record a debut that sounds imported from an Alfonso Cuaron movie, rife with homoerotic binge drinking. Unfortunately, 
Strokes drummer Fabrizio Moretti, Los Hermanos singer/guitarist 
Rodrigo Amarante and his girlfriend Binki Shapiro are not half as 
exciting. The trio that is Little Joy replaces their former intense sensu-
ality with chilled-out pool-party tunes — great as background noise 
but no deeper than the shallow end.

Little Joy begins with a pair of perfect margaritas: “The Next Time 
Around” and “Brand New Start” personify beach-chic with lazy vocals, 
surf-twang guitars and simple tin-pot drumming. But the album loses 
focus fast, distracted into a string of identical sleepy guitars repeatedly 
reworked into the same tasteless potato-salad songs. This random scat-
tering of potholes between head-bopping tracks like “Keep Me In Mind” 
makes for an awkwardly stilted, uneven pace — enough to give even the 
most dedicated fans a little bout of seasickness.

Occasionally, a little focus and practice shine through: “No One’s 
Better Sake” picks up the party with stop-and-go strumming and 
intentionally random piano chords that trimly avoid discordance. 
Country-vocal sensibilities hung on the galloping guitars of “How To 
Hang A Warhol” are also refreshingly precise.

Due to the massive audience behind their main sheen, it’s safe to 
assume that Little Joy will be instant indie success — atmospheric, anx-
iously-in-love Los Hermanos delivered in slurred-sexy Strokes lyrics and 
bathed in beach party vibes from an LA recording studio — but incon-
sistent haste threaten disaster.

Little Joy will play live at the House of Blues, San Diego on Dec. 5.

Travis
■ Ode to J. Smith
RED TELEPHONE BOX 

W hile fans of rocky rock might find the glossy melan-choly of Travis passe, their sixth LP is heavy on beat and light on the tinkly jangle of The Boy With No 
Name and The Man Who; not only is Ode to J. Smith their 
first record to feature a prominent electric guitar since 
1997 debut Good Feeling, but there’s hardly a tambourine 
to be found. Like so many other Brit-rock bands this year 
(ahem, Coldplay), Travis has remodeled its polite quietude 
for a new bristling drama and thirst for energy.

Any progression from their opiate-lidded musing 
should be commended, and Travis’ go at raw, chugging 
rock chords only slightly wobbles in places. The neutered 
“Broken Mirror” is a self-explanatory slow-cooker, but 
is soon compensated by “Song To Self,” which starts 
out with ethereal organs, plunging into a wonderland 
of country-fried guitar. “Before You Were Young” high-
lights Fran Healy’s lightly wispy, frayed voice in a ballad 
reminiscent of an R.E.M. hook, and the upbeat, lilting  
“Last Words” does just fine without the repetitive hi-hat 
of a busy drum kit.

In the end, Travis’ try at heaviness weighs a tad lop-
sided, Healy’s dreamy vibes often clashing with a new-
found drum-and-bass booming. At its highest, Smith 
captures a glimmer of old alternative staples, but lows 
arrive as nothing more than shoddy Oasis sound-alikes.

Travis will play live at the Troubadour in Los Angeles 
on Nov. 11.

had the same shots and the same 
opportunities, but haven’t found the 
back of the net.” 

Looking ahead to the matchup 
against the Gators on Friday, UCSD 
owns the all-time series 9-2-1 against 
San Francisco State despite the loss 
earlier this season. McManus said 
the team will try to close down the 
Gators’ opportunities on set plays.

“They score most of their goals 

on set plays like corner kicks and 
free kicks,” he said. “We’re working 
on trying to mark the right way 
against a very athletic team ... It will 
be a tough match but we’re excited 
to try and avenge the earlier loss to 
them.”

poll, the Tritons were picked to fin-
ish second in the conference behind 
rival Chico State. Elliot acknowledged 
that the poll holds her team with high 
esteem, but cautions that the team’s 
season hasn’t even started.  

“It was a sign of respect for our 
returners because we play in such a 
tough conference,” Elliot said. “But 
every coach will say that preseason 
rankings mean nothing.” 

Ilg said she believes the team held 
itself to a high standard even before 
the preseason rankings were released.  

“We have high expectations and 
we are not going to settle,” Ilg said. 
“We train every day to be the best 
— nothing else.”

Elliot hopes that this mindset, in 

addition to the team’s defensive ener-
gy, will draw in more spectators in 
support of the team. 

“We need fans to be there,” Elliot 
said. “We’re representing the entire 
student body every time we step on 
the floor, and we’re trying to do that 
with a lot of integrity, class and heart. 
This is what college basketball is 
about. Getting behind your team and 
supporting them — we need that.”

The Tritons play an exhibi-
tion game against cross-town rival 
University of San Diego on Nov. 14

Men’s Crew Places 13th 
Against Tough Competitors
By Brianna Lee
Staff Writer

CREW —  Racing on Nov. 2, the UCSD 
men’s crew team competed in its sec-
ond event of the season when the team 
traveled to Newport Beach for the 
Newport Autumn Rowing Festival. The 
regatta welcomed programs from all 
over California, including top competi-
tors from UC Berkeley and Stanford 
University. The men’s open-eight 
race included 32 universities, and the 
Tritons’ A boat claimed a 13th-place 
finish while the B boat dashed toward 
the finish one second later, propel-
ling the Tritons to top the UC Irvine 
Anteaters’ finish by a wide 17-second 
margin.  

“Both our top boats did exactly what 
we went there to do and that was push 
each other, row well and put up fast 
times,” said sophomore Justin Gordon, 
who sat fourth seat in the A boat. 

Leading in first and second place 
were UC Berkeley and Stanford. 

“Competing with teams like Cal 
and Stanford is always exciting,” senior 
co-captain Jonathon Lynch said. “Our 
program is in the process of making 
competitions against competitors like 
that just another day in the office. It 
won’t happen overnight, but if we keep 
putting together consistently aggressive 
and competitive boats eventually we 
will reach that point.” 

The Tritons’ next race will be the 
San Diego Fall Classic, which is set for 
this weekend at Mission Bay. 

“This weekend should be another 
interesting test of our fitness and skill,” 
Gordon said. “I would love to see us 
make up even more ground on our 
competition and use our speed to make 
our other boats faster.”

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2008

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — 
According to head coach Charity 
Elliot, the key to success for the UCSD 
women’s basketball team this season is 
defense. It’s the same key she introduced 
to last year’s squad, which finished 25-
10, 14-6 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association with an appearance in 
the NCAA Division-II West Regional 
Semifinal game.  

This year, the Tritons look to up 
their intensity on the defensive side of 
the court. Elliot has made a point of 
stressing ball pressure as a focus for the 
team and has implemented several full-
court presses to utilize this strength.

“We have a very defensive mind-
set and we want to be known for our 
pressure defense,” Elliot said. “Our ball 
pressure sets up our defense to be very 
up-tempo, with lots of pressuring and 
trapping, and we still have some things 
we haven’t put in quite yet.”

The Triton squad will apply the 
defensive pressure with several famil-
iar faces, including three-time All-
Conference First-Team senior forward 
Michelle Osier and returning starters 
senior center Alexis Gaskin and junior 
forward Erin Noonan. Accompanying 
the trio in the starting lineup are junior 
guards Annette Ilg and Leilani Martin, 
a transfer from Foothill College, who 
have the responsibility of keeping the 
opposing teams’ offenses stymied by 
harassing its guards. 

Though depth was a concern for 
the team at the start of the year, several 
newcomers and transfer players have 
put the team in a good place. As a co-
captain, Ilg said she feels that the Tritons 
have already made big strides in coming 
together as a team, which was a concern 
with so many new faces. 

“We’ve proven that we can trust 
one another and it can only get better,” 
she said.

Elliot has also instituted a motion 
offense, but said that it will take time for 
the team to understand the system. For 

now, her goal is simply to give opportu-
nities to the players who can make plays 
happen on their own. 

“We have some players that can 
create and we’re trying to put them 
in positions where they can be most 
effective,” Elliot said. “Our offense has a 
long way to go, though you never want 
to be peaking at this time of the season 
anyway — and we’re not close.”

Until the Tritons learn the new 
offense, the players expect to rely on 

their defense, creating turnovers that 
they can expand into fast-break oppor-
tunities. 

“We really want to be able to run 
the other team out of the gym,” Ilg said. 
“We’re working on reading screens and 
knowing our teammates in the motion 
offense, but until then we have to be 
able to fast break.”

UCSD Earns Third Seed Despite Struggles
By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The stage is 
set for the No. 20 UCSD women’s soc-
cer team. Winning two games would 
more than guarantee the team a spot 
in the NCAA Division-II National 
Tournament. One loss and the team will 
have to bite its fingernails while it awaits 
the 48-team field to be announced.

Despite going winless in three of their 
last four contests, the Tritons secured a 
spot in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships with a 0-0 
tie against Cal State San Bernardino on 
Oct. 31. 

“This past weekend definitely wasn’t 
our best play, but it also wasn’t our worst,” 
senior forward Natasha Belak-Berger 
said. “The team is up for the matches 
this weekend and we’ll be ready.”

UCSD owns the third seed heading 
into the championships, to be held at 
RIMAC Field. The Tritons will face off 
against second-seeded San Francisco 
State Nov. 7, one of only three teams to 
defeat the Tritons this season. The win-
ner will move on to face either Sonoma 
State or Cal State Dominguez Hills in 
the finals.

After entering the CCAA in 2000, 
the Tritons have dominated the con-
ference — qualifying for nine straight 
CCAA Championships and winning 
six of them. 

“Our players are dedicated to the 
game and work very hard,” head coach 
Brian McManus said. 

 With a chance to clinch the top seed 
in the CCAA Championships over the 
weekend, the Tritons battled to another 
double-overtime thriller with Cal State 

San Bernardino, this time ending in a 
scoreless tie. The tie was followed by 
a lackluster performance at Cal Poly 
Pomona where UCSD fell 2-0 Nov. 2. 

The Broncos got on the board in the 
21st minute when their forward snuck 
the ball by senior Triton goalkeeper 
Jessica McGovern. They would tally the 
second goal in the final seconds of the 
game to secure the win. 

UCSD outshot Cal Poly Pomona 8-7 
but couldn’t figure out the Broncos’ sub-
stitute goalie, who came into the match 
when the starting goalie was injured.

While the performance was substan-
dard for the club, it was understandable 
as the Tritons were coming off an emo-
tional 0-0 double-overtime tie against 
Cal State San Bernardino. The tie all but 
locked up a postseason spot for UCSD 
while eliminating the Coyotes.

The Triton defense turned in its third 
consecutive shutout, but this time the 
Triton offense couldn’t get the golden 
goal to support the defense. After scor-
ing 11 times in five games, the UCSD 
offense has fallen flat, scoring only once 
in the team’s final four matches. 

“We’re not worried about these past 
four games affecting our performance,” 
Belak-Berger said. “If nothing else, it 
will inspire us to want it that much 
more. We had some players out this 
weekend because of injury but they 
should be ready to go this Friday.”

To make a legitimate playoff run, the 
Tritons are going to need scores from 
Belak-Berger, who leads all Tritons with 
11 goals, and senior midfielder Loren 
Borenstein, who has four. 

“We’re not going to do anything

MEN’S SOCCER — The Tritons 
hit the road to take on California 
Collegiate Athletic Association foes 
Cal State San Bernardino and Cal 
Poly Pomona on Oct. 31 and Nov. 2, 
respectively, earning mixed results, 
losing to San Bernardino 2-1 before 
thrashing Pomona 4-0. The split deci-
sion means the squad will finish the 
year with an overall record of 10-6-2 
and a CCAA record of 6-6-2. With 20 
conference points, UCSD will finish 
in fourth place in the CCAA South 
Division.

The Tritons looked to extract 
some revenge against a Cal State San 
Bernardino squad that handed them a 
3-0 loss at Triton Soccer Field on Sept. 
28. However, the Coyotes struck first 
as sophomore forward Jose Godinez 
was able to put home a deflected cross 
that landed right in front of him in 
the match’s 22nd minute. The Tritons 
regrouped after the slow start and 
found an equalizer early on in the 
second half. In the 55th minute, soph-
omore defender Aaron McDowell 
played a ball into the box that senior 
forward Tony Fernandez volleyed over 
the keeper for his sixth goal of the sea-
son. Later in the second half, Godinez 
sprang free for a strike after a through 
ball from Coyote sophomore mid-
fielder Obi Agwu. Godinez’s second 
goal of the match put the victory out 
of reach for the Tritons. 

The conditions in San Bernardino 
made the game tougher on the 
Tritons.

“It’s in the middle of the desert and 
it is always a hard place to play,” senior 
goalkeeper Peter Akman said. “I think 
we outplayed them, but sometimes the 
dice don’t roll our way.”

With their postseason hopes gone 
with the loss, the Tritons traveled 
to Cal Poly Pomona to take on the 
Broncos at Kellog Field. UCSD net-
ted three goals in the first half and 
tacked on another in the second half 
to rout the Broncos 4-0. Sophomore 
midfielder Joe Shah opened the scor-
ing with the first goal of his career 
in the 11th minute, heading home a 
cross from sophomore defender Josh 
Jackson. Shah was again involved in a 
score in the 18th minute, assisting on a 
goal by sophomore defender Brandon 
Yee that put the Tritons up 2-0. Junior 
midfielder Tony Choi connected on 
a penalty kick in the 41st minute to  
increase the lead.

In the second half, Fernandez con-
tinued his scorching play in the 84th 
minute as he connected on a header 
for his seventh goal of the season. 
Fernandez, who tallied five goals in 
the final five matches of the season, 
was assisted on the play by senior 
midfielder Ali Shams. 

While the Tritons fell short of the 
postseason, Pascale said his first cam-
paign as head coach was a successful 
one.

“My goal was to create a winning 
culture where we take each day seri-
ously and get the most out of our-
selves,” Pascale said. “They did their 
best all season and from that stand-
point I can be happy.”

Akman said he believes the pro-
gram will be in good hands going 
forward under Pascale’s leadership.

 “I think [Pascale] is going to bring 
the best out of his players for years to 
come,” Akman said.
