Police ComplaInts 
SANTA BARBARA - As 
students continue to come 
forward with complaints 
about police actions during 
Halloween weekend, Associ-
ated Students leaders are 
pledging their resources to 
help inform students of their 
rights. Although law enforce-
ment officials have deemed 
their "no tolerance" policy a 
success, some students have 
filed complaints with the 
Santa Barbara County 
Sheriff's Department. A.S. 
President Geoff Green has 
been compiling a list of 
names of people who believe 
they were either wrongly 
arrested or treated improperly 
by police. 

Davis Students Will 
Select New Mascot 
DAVIS - Students at UC 
Davis will have the opportu-
nity to vote for their choice of 
an official mascot - the cow, 
the mustang or the Aggie. 
The vote also provides the 
opportunity to recommend a 
mascot to the university if the 
three suggestions are deemed 
unappealing. Associated 
Students UCD Vice President 
Jodi Sakol said the ballot 
measure emerged following a 
student's interest last spring 
in determining an official 
mascot for UCD. 

UCSB Chancellor 
Deadline Extended 
SANTA BARBARA-
University of California 
President Jack Peltason 
extended the Oct. 15 applica-
tion deadline for UCSB's 
chancellor position an extra 
month to allow time for 
additional hopefuls to make 
their bids. 'There wasn't 
enough time to get all the 
nominations and applica-
tions," said Graduate Student 
Association Internal President 
Marisela Marquez. A search 
committee meeting scheduled 
for Nov. 8 was postponed.

A n oil rig explodes in the Santa Barbara Channel, setting loose millions of gallons of black grease over the open ocean. 
Emergency crews try to contain the spill, but 
currents change unexpectedly. The oil coats a 
beach and tidepools, causing irreversible en-
vironmental damage. All told, crews spend 
months shoveling the black muck and raking 

through sand before the cleanup is finished. 
If a project underway at UCSD's Scripps

tific gold, that disastrous scenario may never 
take place. 

Scientists at SIO's Center for Coastal Stud-
ies (CCS) will watch the Santa Barbara

Senior Staff Writer 

In a change that will dramati-

ment, the University of California 
Stu dent A~socialion ( C A ) 
voted over the weekend to sepa-

preme Court· s ruling in the SIII;III 
v. Regel/IS case. 

The rul ing, which made the use

would have el i 111 i nuted most of the 
UCSA·s $2 I 5,OOO-a-year budget

the reorganization takes effect on

The UCSA has created ··a sepa-

funds used for lobby ing," said 
UCSA Executi ve Director Andy 
Shaw. However, there is currently 
no source of funds for the new 
board, which will be headed by the 
lobbying directors from each of 
the campus governments. The 
UCSA will try to raise separate 
funds for lobbying from pri vate 
sources. 

Accordin g to Shaw, the 
UCSA's ori ginal plan, which 
would have kept the lobbying a -

Tuesday Forum Addresses Recent Momentum Incidents 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

With last week's controversy 
over the latest Momentum issue 
still fresh in their minds, 50 stu-
dents attended an open forum on 
Tuesday to discuss the incident 
and its coverage in the Guardian. 

Last week, the editors of Mo-
mentum, an Asian-American 
newspaper, reported that 2,000 
copies of their latest issue had been 
taken by students who were an-

gered by an article some deemed 
racist. 

Warren College senior David 
Lee, who organized Tuesday's 
forum, began by denying the alle-
gations of Momentum's editors. 

''They were wrong. None of 
these [accusations] can be sub-
stantiated," Lee said. "To put that 
blame on five or so Asian-Ameri-
can men is ridiculous." 

Lee admitted that he had taken 
a few copies, looked at the article, 

and then thrown the papers away. 
However, he refuted the idea that 
he could have taken stacks of pa-
pers without being noticed by other 
students in the old Student Center. 
"Is it unreasonable if you had a 
couple [of issues 1 for your friends 
as well , for you to toss lthem] 
outT' Lee asked. 

Lee questioned the validity of 
Momentum'sc1aim that 2,000 cop-
ies had been stolen, adding that

Philosophy Professor 
Examines Gene Ethics 
STUDY: Kitcher will spen4 a year looking at the 
Human Genome Project and assessing its goals 
By Dan Kra ... 
Sen/or Staff Writer 

UCSD Philosophy Professor 
Philip Kitcher has been appointed 
by the Library of Congress to e1(-
amine the social and ethical reper-
cussions of the controversial Hu-
man Genome Project. 

Proponents of the project, an 
altemp to map out

human ge nome, 
promise that it will

pretation of medical genetic tests. 
The association of genes and dis-
ease is not clear-cut, Kitcher said. 
Sometimes a person ClllTYing a 
disease gene nt:ver acquires the 
disease. Likewise, some people 
who are missing the disease gene 
contract the disease anyway. 

"We' re talking about [medicall

During his year-

long appointment, 
Kitcher will talk to 
Human Genome Project scientists 
across the nation, as well as those 
who oppose the project. 

In the spring of 1994, Kitcher 
will report his findings to federal 
legislators in Washington, D.C. 

Until that time, Kitcher said he 
will attempt to ascertain what the 
scientific goals of the project are, 
whether these goals are attainable 
and how the project will impact 
social issues. 

According to Kitcher, if the 
Human Genome Project is suc-
cessful, it will allow scientists to 
determine whether or not an indi-
vidual carries a predisposition to a 
cenain disease or perhaps even a 
specific behavior. 

This, Kitcher said, arouses a 
variety of concerns regarding so-
cial discrimination. For instance, 
can an employer ask prospective 
employees fortbeir genetic "report 
cardT' Similarly, will individuals 
carrying particular genes be unable 
to find insurance coverage? 

Another complication of the 
Human Genome Project, accord-
ing to Kitcher, is the correct inter-

customize the ge: 
netic configuration of the popula-
tion. 

"Designer babies and these 
sorts of things are in the distant 
future, if they're possible ever. at 
all," Kitcher said. 

This manipulation of the ge-
netic dynamics of a population is, 
to some, reminiscent ofthe eugen-
ics movement of the early 20th 
century. 

The movement, which sought 
to increase the biological fitness 
of a society by controlling the 
breeding of the population, culmi-
nated in the Nazi programs for 
race hygiene. 

Kircher said he will examine 
the ethical aspects of the Human 
Genome Project to determine if 
society can enjoy its benefits with-
out inevitably making "dreadful 
moral mistakes." 

Kitcher is a philosopher of sci-
ence who teaches classes in the 
Philosophy Department and in the 
Revelle humanities program. In 
addition, he has written several 
books on topics such as creation-
ism, evolution and sociobiology.

Memory Expert SI)eaks Next Month 
UCSD's Stein Institute for Research on Aging (SIRA) 

will present a lecture on the anatomy of human 
memory on Wednesday, Dec. 15 at 6 p.m. in the 
Garren Auditorium at the School of Medicine. 

UCSD Psychiatry Professor Larry Squire, a re-
searcher with the Veterans' Administration Medical 
Center, will discuss research on the structure and 
organ ization of human memory. Studies of patients 
With brain damage to the medial temporal lobe 
indicate that the function of the memory system Is 
Illuch narrower than once thought. 

Tho medial temporal lobe is essential for storing 
raclual and event-related information that is available 
lor conscIous recollection. Other non-conscious forms 
of memory such as skill learning and habit formation 
operate independently of the medial temporal lobe. 

Squire will also describe new studies which focus 
on how long-term memory Is stored and how patients 
compensate for memory loss. 

The free lecture is one in a monthly series spon-
sored by SIRA. SIRA Is dedicated to increasing lifelong 
health and independence through research into cures 
and treatments of diseases related to aging. 

University Dedicates IOPP II 
Building and ScrIpps Croulng 

On Tuesday, UCSD dedicated the new Institute of 
Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) building, a 
unlversity-wlde research unit lor geophysical research 
and related Investigations In the fields of oceanogr~ 
phy and geology. The new building is located at the 

Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SID). 
The IGPP II building is a four·building complex con-

structed from exposed framing, redwood siding, glass 
sliding doors and flat roofs. The complex was designed 
by Frederick Liebhardt, a former apprentice to archi-
tects Frank lloyd Wright and Lloyd Ruocco. 

Among those appearing at Tuesday's ceremony 
were IGPP Director John Orcutt, SIO Director Edward 
Frieman and UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson. State 
Insurance Director John Garamendl and Texas Instru-
ments Founder Cecil Green. a major contributor to the 
IGPP II facility, were also on hand. 

A ribbon·cutting ceremony was also held at 
Tuesday's ceremony to inaugurate the Scripps Cross· 
ing. a pedestrian bridge over La Jolla Shores Drive that 
connects the east and west sides of the Scripps 
campus. The bridge, which was designed by Engineer· 
ing Professor Frieder Selble, is the first cable-stayed 
bridge in Califomla.

A.S. Debates Proposed -F1Dlding Board 
MEmNG: No final 
decision reached on 
organizations' status 
By A1.xander Th .... n 
Staff Writer 

The Associated Student Coun-
cil laid out tentative plans last night 
for a funding eligibility board 
which would be used to detennine 
eligibility of student organizations 
for receiving allocations from 
mandatory student fees . 

At press time, no final guide-
lines had been approved by the 
council. 

The board was necessitated by 
the Smith v. Regents decision, 
which made it illegal for manda-
tory student fees to fund political, 
religious or ideological organiza-
tions. 

Five members, selected by their 
respective college councils, and 
one A.S. representative would 
compose the voting body of the 
new board. The A.S. Vice Presi-

student papers are only supposed 
to be put in designated media racks 
at various locations around the

Lee, custodial policy dictates that 
any papers left on the ground may 
be picked up and thrown away, 
which is what Lee believes hap-
pened to the majority of the issues. 

None of Momentum's editors

The board would allocate fund-

anger with the article in Momen-
tum, but questioned the validity of 
taking even a few papers and 
throwing them away. "In a way 
you are taking ... a right to know 
from someone," she said. 

"Throwing something away [isl 
tangible, it feels good. It shows 
initial outrage ... I think it's natural 
and it's healthy," Lee responded. 
He pointed out that he had not 
simply thrown a number of papers 
away. but took further action such 
as posting flyers in the Student 
Affirmative Action Coalition of-
fices, taking his grievance to the 
Guardian and calling Tuesday's 
forum. 

"Turning your back never 
solves anything," Lee added. 

Warren College sophomore 
Eugene Kim disagreed with the 

objections. "If the organization is 
determined educational, then it 
remains that way unless someone 
appeals that," said A.S. Preside nt 
Carla Tesak. Registered media 
and services wi ll be exempt from

Denying Emergency Care 
10 Immigrants Is Unethical 

With the backlash against illegal immigration in full-swing, 
the San Diego Board of Supervisors' decision to stop paying the 
emergency medical costs of illegal immigrants admitted to UCSD 
Medical Center should not come as a surpri e. In response to the 
board's vote, UCSD Medical Center Director of Government, 
Comracts and Physical Relations Jan Spencley released a state-
mem aying thaI the "UCSD Medical Center, just as every 
hospital with an emergency room, has both a moral and legal 
obl igation to treat anyone requiring emergency treatment." 

Moral obligation, indeed. It seems that this "concern" over the 
costs that illegal immigrants place on the city, the county and the 
tate has gone a little too far. 

Consider the implications of the board's "cost cutting" deci-
~ion: a man i hit by a car as he is crossing the intersection at Villa 
La Jolla and La Jolla Village Drive. He is critically wounded. A II 
ambulance arrives, places the man on a stretcher and takes hi m II 
Thornton Hospital for vital emergency care, Upon arriving, he 
asked for identification. i, Como? The man does not speak En-
glish. After determining he is not a U.S. citizen, the supervisor 
tells the doctor that the hospital cannot operate on him. He his 
10 ing blood quickly. While being transported to County General, 
he dies. 

Though fictional, this is not an unrealistic situation - had the 
UCSD Medical Center agreed with the board's deci sion that 
immigrants should not receive emergency medical care . Fortu-
nately, they did not. By the very nature, the very definition of the 
health-care profeSSion, they cannot. It is a cruel double-bind to 
put the Medical Center into. 

According to county officials, nearly half of the S 10.8 million 
received by the university this year went to "iIIegais" in San 
Diego - an estimated $5 million loss is projected for next year. 
As most know, the university is hardly a tower of wealth these 
days. To make a bad situation worse, this year the Med Center has 
lost some $50 million from patients defaulting on bills. These 
financial losses have forced the Med Center to take painful 
austerity measures: a $70 million program of cuts has been 
enacted, which will include early retirement, possibly layoffs. 
The $5 million used for absorbing immigrant costs will set the 
Med Center back even further, according to Spendey, "hinder[ing 1 
our ability to fund replacement equipment and to invest in ne\\ 
services and technology." 

However, judging from the debate surrounding the "ill e~ I 
immigrant question," perhaps the board's "logic" is not just tb, 
cost itself, but that such "entitlements" provide incentives In' 
Mexican migration to the United States and San Diego. As 
questionable as this argument is in general, it's plainly absurd 
when one considers that these are emergency medical services, 
not check-ups and dental care. However, whether or not such 
medical care is an incentive for migration is immaterial. Provid-
ing emergency care is simply a question of morality, something 
of which the board seems to be in short supply. 

'ele-Job Slows Down Job-
Searching Process 

The good old days of finding a job from the listings at Career 
Services are gone, replaced by yet another supposed time-saving 
automated convenience, Tele-Job. Job seekers dial the number 
and entertheir student IDs and the codes of the job categories they 
are interested in. A computerized voice then reads a description 
of each job in the category. 

The problem with Tele-Job, however, is that it is not a 
convenience. Instead of stopping by Career Services for a few 
minutes to scan the list of possibilities, students must now sit on 
the phone and wait as a monotonous voice intones each job's 
specifications. Although students can skip forward to the nexi 
listing, they must first listen long enough to know whether or no' 
they want to hear the rest of the information. 

At an average time of one minute a listing and with 30 li stil1 <' 
in a category, a student who wants to listen to several categori c.' 
could easily waste the entire afternoon on the phone. 

Though the attempt at efficiency is commendable, automation 
is not always the answer. If Career Services is really looking for 
ways to save students time, it should retain the old system, which 
is still the fastest and easiest way to find a job.

CHANGING THE RULES 
OF THE GAME 

COMMENTARY: Dissatisfaction with "winner-take-all" electoral systems has 
sparked debate in Canada, New Zealand and Britian over the merits of propor-
tional representation

1993 eIection and the obliteration of the 
Conservative Parliamentary Party ,onemUSl 
consider the electoral rules of the game . 

Canada, like the United States, Britain, 
New Zealand and India. uses an electoral 
system called "First Past the Post" (FPTP), 
a form of "plurality" in which candidates 
contest single-member constituencies. The 
person who polls the most votes wins the 
seat, whether or not he secures a majority. 
Though people in these countries assume 
their system is used throughout the world, 
the vast majority of democratic nations use 
some fonn of "proportional representation" 
(PR) to elect their govemments. PR sys-
tems award seats in proportion to national 
votes cast for a party, and therefore produce 
radically different results than FPTP sys-
tems.

license to ru Ie alone. 
The anomalies in Canada are symp-

tomatic of a more widespread failure of 
FPTP. Historically, under plurality, gov-
ernments have been returned to office with 
considerably less votes that their main com-
petitors.1n the South African "whites only" 
general election of 1948, Jan Smuts' gov-
ernment received 52 percent of the popular 
vote and 72 seats in parliament, while his 
opponent. D.F. Malan's Afrikaner party, 
received 42 percent of the vote and 79 
seats. Malan became Prime Minister and 
began the South African pOlicy of Apart-
heid - a policy which has had obvious, 
far-reaching effects. 

FPTPalso puts minor panies at a severe 
disadvantage. In Britain, for example, the 
''third party" role is filled by the Liberclls, 
who claim up to 25 percent of the popular 
vote, but have never won more than three 
percent of the parliamentary seats. The 
same is UlJe for minor parties in New 
Zealand and Canada. 

The disturbing features of FPTP might 
lead one to think that electorate around the 
world would be pushing forchange .. and 
indeed, this is the case. Last weekend, New 
Zealanders voted to throwaway their plu-
rality system and move to PRo One of the 
primary motivations for this change was a 
desire to fairly represent minor panies, in 
particular the Maoris, in Parliament. In 
Britain, as well, there ha been continual 
pressure for electoral reform. The Liberal 
Democrats have consistently called for a

election gives rise to a Labour-Liberal coalition govern-
ment, it could remove one of the last bastions of plurality. 
Likewise, in Canada, voices are now calling for electoral

change because of the results of the 
October genenil election. 

Thus. before the end of the cen-
tury, the United States c:ould c0n-
ceivably be left as an isolated de-
fender of FPIP, in a world where 
governments are elected on the ba-
sis of national popular will rather 
than on a sear-by-seal basis. So we 
must pose the question, what dif-
ferences would a move to PRcreate 
within the American political sys-
tem? 

Fora start, PR wooId breakdown 
the ~party stranglehold that the 
Democrats and Republicans pres-
ently enjoy in the United States. 
Organized third parties, like Ross 
Perot's "United We Stand" could 
gain a substantial block of Con-
gressional seats, giving them an 
insider's platform 10 critique gov-
ernment policy. We migtu also see 
the Democrats and Republicans split 
into constituent parts, breaking up 
their present large umbrella group-
ings. Forexample, the Republicans' 
religious rigm could form a sepa-
rate party in competition with the 
"Jack Kempite" liberal Republi-
cam. 

Under PRo Americans would 
have more options - new ideas 
and candidates - corne election 
time. On the negative sicIe. there 
wooIdaisobeamucbgrearerchance 
of c:oaIition govemmenlS. This is 
one of the chief criticisms of PR. 
Yet it could be IIIJued thai coalition 
government is what we now have 
on Capitol Hill and the introduction 

ofPR would ~Iy make such coa-
litions more representative. 

PR would certBin1y eliminate the 
controversy concerning minorit) 
voting rights legislation. Since thl' 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, states 
have been forced to draw increas-
ingly strange constituency bound-
aries to try to give minority popula-
tions fairreprescntatives. This prac-
tice of "moral gerrymandering" led 
to a recent Iega1 case in which the 
Supreme Court ruledthat the lines of 
the 12th Congressional District of 
North Carolina were so unpleasing 
to the eye (the constituency stretched 
through North Carolina from top to 
bottom. sometimes only connected 
by a single highway lane) thai it was 
deemed unconstitutional. 

A much easier way to ensure fair 
minority representation in Congress 
would be to inttoduce PR on a state-
wide basis. Minority candidates 
would not only be more likely to be 
included on major party's lists, but 
they would also have the potential of 
winning seats as popular individu-
als. 

Whether or not 10 keep the FPTP 
system is a question which has never 
unduly bOubled the American mind. 
However, with the recent events i" 
New Zealand and Canada and tl " 
potential for change in Great BI;\ 
aiD, issuessunoundinge\ectoral sys-
terns may gain focus. 

Historically, countries that 
change systems have been forced to 
do so when two party d.ominance 
declines and minority voices begin 
asserting themselves. Perhaps the 
impact of Ross Perot in 1992 and the 
increasing concern with fair repre-
sentaIionof minority political views 
warns us that a full-fledged debate 
about PR in America is rigbt around 
the comer.

EdJtor: 

'LEE RESPONDS TOAttEGATIONS IN 
MOMENTUM TRAsHING 

I'm sorry for all those people who 
were outraged at the alleged actions of 
those who "stole" 2,000 copies of 
Momentum. I guess that the actions 
charged would warrant the anger and 
responses found in Monday's issue. 
However, it seems that there has been 
a gross exaggeration of the facts. 

After speaking in person with 
Guardilln News Editor Philip 
Michaels, I left with the understand-
ing that there would be a fair and 
objective news write-up of what had 
transpired. I was disappointed to find 
that Thursday's issue had a very one-
sided and misleading front page ar-
ticle. The story seemed to implicate 
Lambda Phi Epsilon and myselfas the 
perpetrators of a very seriou clime. It 
went on to imply that I had admitted to 
the "theft" of 2,000 copies of Momel/· 
111m. This was a dangerous and detri-
mental act. The result of these false 
implications have seriously affected 
various individuals. 

A.S. Fraternity advisor Paul 
Dewine specifically told MomellIum 
editor Joanne Tashiro that her accusa-
tions against the fraternity were false, 
and strongly advised her not to impli-
cate the fraternity. Ms. Tashiro ig-
nored this fact and went on to go ahead 
and slam yet another organization. 

In regards to my admittance of the 
theft. I specifically told Michaels that 
the count of 2,000 taken within an 
hour was ridiculous. I did say that 
many people had been complaining 
about the article and had individually 
thrown some copies out. I went on to 
clarify that there were many people, 
men and women, taking such actions. 
Also, I had infonned Michaels that the

incident with two individuals being 
confronted by Ms. Tashiro for taking 
100 copies was incorrect. Witnesses 
at the Student Center assert that in fact 
it was only four to five issues and that 
they were thrown away after the con-
frontation. 

As in the past, Momenlllm is stir-
ring up controversy and implicating 
individuals and organizations falsely . 
I feel that it is safe to assume that there 
is a personal agenda behind these at-
tacks. 

There still exists the question of 
where many of the copies did go. I 
spoke with A.S. Media Advisor Randy 
Woodard to explain what had hap-
pened. He reminded me that campus 
custodial services make it a point to 
throwaway any papers found on the 
ground. 

Even stacks of new publications 
will be tossed out, if they are not in an 

appropriate media distribution rack. It 
is interesting to note that Momentum 
only has one of these racks. 

In regard to the "major legal reper-
cussions," they are nil. There is no 
substantiation behind the Momellfum 
staff's accusations. Again, they are 
blindly swinging without regards to 
whom they may injure. A.S. Student 
Organizations Advisor MarciaStrong 
commented that MomelllulII needed 
10 back up its allegations. 

So what do we do now? To the 
Guardian,l would ask that you clarify 
the allegations and print a more truth-
ful news story. To the UCSDcommu-
nity I would ask that you appeal to 
your rational senses and decide what 
needs to be done. [n light of reality, I 
do not find it necessary to apologize to 
Momelllum for allegedly stealing 
2,000 copies. I will, however, apolo-
gize to those who have been lied to by 
Momelllllm and misled by a biased 
Guardian news piece. For those who 
want to "smash Illy wri ts with a 
sledgehammer," I say look al the facts 
and reconsider your prorest. I agree 
Ihat the ideal of stealing 2,000 copies 
is a huge violation of Momentum' 
rights. However, this is a violation 
that just didn't take place. Thank you 
David Snow for having the intelli-
gence to see the real problem. Let's 
get beyond the false accusations and 
remember the real problem, rncism.

OIL: Computers 
help researchers 
predict currents 
ContInued from pace 1 

But predicting changes in the 
direction of ocean currents is not 
easy. In fact, CCS DirectorClinton 
Winant likens the problem to the 
dilemma faced by meteorologists, 
who can barely predict the weather 
one day in advance. "The vanabil-
ity in the ocean is at least as great 
as the variability in the atmo-
sphere," Winant said. 

Currently, weathermen attempt 
to forecast by picking from a se-
ries of scenarios such as "Santa 
Ana winds," not by estimating the 
exact temperature for the next day . 

"If you predict Santa Anas for 
tomorrow, you can't say the wind 
will be exactly 15.4milesperhour 
off the pier, but you can say that it 
will be hot and windy. There is a 
degree of accuracy, but a lot of 
vagueness," Winant said. 

Like meteorologists, Winant 
said his group of oceanographers 
will try to take a "synoptic" view 
of ocean currents - making gen-
eralized predictions based on a 
few scenarios. This will enable 
them to foresee the general direc-
tion oil could move after a spill, 
although they would not be able to 
give exact information. 

These predictions will be of 
use only in the Santa Barbara area, 
since they are based on conditions 
unique to the channel. "lbere are 
no Santa Anas over Boston," 
Winant said. 

Winant added, however, that

If successful, the study will help 
with more than just oil spills. 
Movement of spilled sewage and 
the effects of fisheries can be 
gauged once currents are beller 
understood . .. It has an application 
wherever humans come in contact 
with the ocean," Winant said . 

Most importantly, the study wil l 

hopefully provide insight into the 
workings of the ocean on a basic 
science level. '''The application to 
an oil spill is very secondary," 
Winant said.

The scientists use drifters, 
buoys which are propelled by sur-
face ocean water, to trace the pos-
sible routes oil could take. A drifter 
trapped in the summer warm-wa-

nel until it is pushed out to sea by 
winds coming around Point Con-
ception to the north of Santa Bar-

bara, according to Physical Ocean-
ography Research Division Direc-
tor Nancy Bray. 

Drifters which miss the current 
usually end up on a certain beach 
at the south side of Santa Barbara. 
'These are the kinds of [currents] 
which noticeably affect where oil 
goes," Bray said. 

CCS oceanographers have used 
a variety of ex peri mental methods 
to find the general condition cre-
ated by the summer' s warm water.

The researchers also maintain 
buoys anchored to the ocean floor 
which monitor the current and

cal stations track the weather from 
several islands. 

In addition, data taken in previ-
ous studies will be used to make 
predictions.

The flood of information gen-
erated by the project will be nearly 
useless if it is not carefully col-
lected and anal yzed, Bray said . To 
predict the movement of currents, 
the researchers are developing 
computer programs similar to 
those used by meteorologists. 

Bray is one of the scientists 
most concerned with the organi-
zation and analysis of the CCS 
data, much of which has not been 
published yet. 

"We were studying ocean cir-
culation in Northern California, 
and we ran out of money before 
the results wele analyzed," she 
said . 

(n addition to the development 
of programs, Bray has compiled 
as much data as possible into the

system. Now, anyone with an elec-
tronic mail account can tunnel 
through theGophercomputerpro-

which Bray named the "Data Zoo."

organization because the student

Even with so much computer

five years allocated to the project

Winant.

is so much data taking place at

In addition to the discussion 
concerning university medical 
centers, the regents will al so be 
taking formal action on the 1994-
95 budget. 

. UCPresidentJack Peltason an-
nounced last month that the uni-
versity was expecting a three per-
cent increase in state funding in 
the next year. Peltason also said 
that a fee increase of $600 to $650 
is likely for the coming year. 

An open session with public 
input on the university' s fee and 
financial aid policies is scheduled 
for today and tomorrow at the 
meeting. 

However, Castillo- Robson 
would not comment directly on 
the UCSA' s current reorganiza-
tion structure because the plan has 
not yet been forwarded to the uni-
versity for review, 

The UCSA is planning to ap-
peal the ban on deductible fees at

have discussed challenging the

with many different time sca les," 
Winant said. 

Also, the events on different 
time scales are associated with 
different energies. The wind can 
have a large effect, but a seasonal 
effect may be tronger, Bray said. 

These complex intera~tions will 
take time to figure out. even though 
the synoptic view allows the re-
searchers to simplify the analysis. 

Convincing people of the valid-
ity of the method will also be chal-
lenging. ''The synoptic view tlies 
in the face of statistics," Bray said. 

Despite the difficulties, Winant 
said he is contident of the validity 
of the synoptic view. ··It 's good 
enough to make short-term pre-
dictions," he said.

Coalition Organizes Border Blockade 

RUB-A-DUB-DUB 

BOYCOTT: Participants 
pf<?test rising incidents 
of immigrant-bashing 
By Karen ChenC 
56nlor Staff WrIter 

Citing an increase in anti-im-
migrant sentiment; a coalition of 
community artists and activists is 
sponsoring an economic boycott 
of San Diego border businesses 
this weekend at the San Ysidro-
Tijuana border. 

Partly composed of members 
of the U.S.-Mellico Border Ameri-
can Friends and the Border Artists 
workshop, the coalition is calling 
upon residents on both sides of the 
border not to patronize businesses 
in the San Diego area this week-
end. The coalition is also asking 
U.S. and Mellican residents not to 
cross in either direction. 

According to San Diego boy-
cott organizer Noreen Sullivan, 
the main intent of the economic 
boycott is to call attention to im-
migrant-bashing, which she says 
has risen in recent months. 

"The level of immigrant bash-
ing going on is approaching epi-
demic proportions. The reasons 
for immigrant-bashing are fal se 
reasons. [Immigrants] are being 
blamed for things they have noth-
ing to do with," she said. 

Coalition representatives said 
the boycott is also being called to 
protest several "immigration con-
trol" proposals from state, local 
and national officials. 

deported into Mexico. People are 
being treated badly just because 
they have brown skin, a Latino 
last name and an accent," Sullivan 
said. 

In addition, the coalition op-
poses any blockade along the U.S.! 
Mexico border, border crossing 
fees or taxes, the deployment of 
the National Guard along the bor-
der and abusive treatment of those 
trying to cross. The coalition also 
said that immigrants should not be 
blamed for California' s problems. 

"Using [immigrants] as a scape-
goat is wrong," said one UCSD 
Chicano student. "I support the 
boycott because immigrant-bash-
ing is very detrimental to any kind 
of Latino; [even though] it may not 
be affecting us directly, it affects us 
indirectly, as sometimes our fami-
lies are not being treated fairly ." 

According to coalition director 
Roberto Martinez, much of the 
protest, which began last Friday, 
is directed against what Tijuana 
residents refer to as " the wall of 
ignominy," an al ready-constructed 
border fence, which has been ex-
tended to the ocean by the Na-
tional Guard .

Contrary to widespread cri ti-
cism that immigrants have been 
depleting the economy, boycott 
organizers want to emphasize all 
that immigrants do for local busi-
nesses. "They contribute to the 
economy, not take out [of it I. They 
pay federal taxes, state taxes, and 
FICA even though they are un-
documented," Sullivan said. "They 
pay an enormous amount, but they 
don 't benefit."

Sullivan said that because of 
the ri sing number of undocu-
mented immigrants, many people 
assume that crime statistics in the 
United States have risen. "Crime 
is not greater because they are 
here .. . crime is greater for other 
reasons," she said. 

Mart inez said that he has re-
ceived varied responses from the 
San Diego business community. 

"It's been an ongoing thing all 
week. We have people on both 
sides circul ating leaflets, putting 
up balloons and banners. We' ve 
received a lot of support from both 
sidesof the border, but we ' ve also 
gotten everything from letters of 
cri ticism to hate calls," Marti nez 
said. 

According to Sulli van , local 
storekeepers are upset by the boy-
cott. "They say ' it' s gonna hurt 
us .. .' blll we're doi ng thi s for two 
main reasons. Fir~ t , there's no way 
to get attent ion to the ma tter ex-
cept ecol1omica ll y, and second , 
even though they're getti ng hurt, 
there's another ~egmen t of the 
commun ity that is bei ng hurt ev-
ery single day, and those are the 
immigrants," Sullivan said. 

Sull ivan said it will be difticult 
to judge the boycott 's effective-
ness because it i a "non-activiI Y." 

"Weare basicall y asking people 
' not' to do certain things, so it's 
hard to calc ulate if we ' ve been 
successful. But [at the least!. we 
consider it a success ifpeople want 
to keep the coalition together. de-

right about the "freezing your

But the most annoying thing 
about the cold was the whole

"You from San Diego!' one

basketball has never seen before.

• WIIo: No.1 Washington University (42-2) vs. RIT (41-7) and No.2 UCSD (24-9) VS. No.3 Juniata (41-3) 

Numerous obstacles will 
stand in UCSD's way against 
Juniata (41-3) on Friday night, 
however. First, it will have to 
play in front of a se ll -out 
Huntingdon, Pennsylvania 
crowd. Second, it will attempt to 
snap Juniata's 51-game home 
winning streak. Third, it will have 
to stop two Juniata outside hit-
ters (senior Nicki Firestone and 
junior Christy Orndorff) who 
each tallied over 400 Idllsduring 
the 1993 regular season. 

Juniata Head Coach Larry 
Bock admits that Firestone and 
Orndroff are the team's two 
strongest forces. "They are the 
two big sticks on ourteam," Bock 
said. "[Firestone] is ourtermina-
tor. [Orndorff} is our best aJl-
around player. She serves the 
ball very well and hits the ball a 
ton for someone her size." 

Despite Juniata's apparent 
advantage, Bock feels that UCSD 
is still the team to beat. "It should 
be a very good match, but I think 
that we're the underdog." 

Juniata vs. UCSD 

Juniata College: For the ninth time in the. college's history, ilnd the 
eighth time in the last nine years,luniata has advanced to the Final Four. 
It is the first time, though, that the school ha hosted the tournament. 

luniata opened the season losi ng two of its first three matches, then 
embarked on a blistering pace, taking 37 of its next 38 contests. 

Its road to the national semi·finals included sweeps over Getty burg, 
lohn Carroll and Thomas More. 

Juniata Head Coach Larry Bock doesn't 
think that having the home coun is roo much 
of an advantage. "The teams involved 
[UCSD, Wash. U., RIT] are used to these 
types of crowds. Our gym is much like San 
Diego's gym," Bock said. 

Juniata is led by enior Nicki Firestone 
(465 kills) and 5'6" junior Chri ty Orndorff 
(402 kills). 

University of California, San Diego: The Tritons have won six 
national titles in the past 12yearsand with Head Coach Doug Dannevik 's 
extensive playoff experience, the Tritons should have an edge over the 
other three teams. 

This season, UCSD had the luxury of playing against top Division I 
and Division II teams, hence the more "average" regular-season record 
of21-9, compared to RfT (38-7), luniata (38-3) and Wash. U. (39-2). 

After an inconsistent tart, San Diego ripped off II straight wins to 
end the year. It advances to the semi-fi nals with victories over Pomona-
Pitzer, College of St. Benedicts and Claremont-Mudd·Scripps. 

Senior Liz Yesanovic led the Tritons with 261 kills, junior Julie 
Harvey collected 188 ki li s and senior Laura Kranz tall ied 186 during the 
regular season.

SEMIFINALS 

RIT vs. Washington University 

Rochester Institute of Technology: The Tigers are definitely the 
cinderella team of the tournament. They make their first Final Four 
appearance in the 20-year history of the school. Thei r unex pee ted emi-
final berth came after a first-round win over State University College at 
Brockport, a second-round sweep of Bates College and a quarterfinal 
victory against the University of Rochester. 

"Just gelling this far is history-making 
for our program," RIT Head Coach Jim 
Lodes said. 

The Tigers amassed a 38-7 record during 
the regular season, including wins in their 
final J 0 matches. 

RJT is led by seniors Robin Wambach 
(512 kills) and Kris Gray (446 kills). 

Washington University in St. louis: 
The Bears are the two-time defending Divi-

sion III national champions and ha ve won three of the last four titles. The 
preseason number-one ranked squad, Wash. U. has maintained that 
ranking all season long and is favored to win its third national champion-
ship in a row. 

The team features four returning All-Americans (MB Amy Sullivan, 
S Leslie Catlin, OH Anne Quenette and MB Amy Alber ). 

"[,d be happy to play either team," Bears Head Coach Teri Clemens 
said when asked if she would rather go up against UCSD or Juniata. 
"Beating Juniata on their home court would be an awesome achievement. 
And playing UCSD on a neutral coun would be great." 

Should Wash. U. get by RlT, the championship match would be an all-
time classic.

Kenyon vs. UCSD 

University of California, San Diego: The Triton men' s soccer 
team is where it is largely because of its dominating defense. Nick 
Terlecky, Matt Chilton, Ken Burns, lay Newcomer and gO<llkeeper 
Michael Madden have combined for eight shutouts during their 16·2-
I regular season. 

Seniors Chris Romey, Robert Ripley and Todd Cumin have paced 
the offense. Romey. a 6'2", 225 lb. force who is intimidating anywhere 
on the field, collected 36 total points, while Ripley hud 17 ~nd Curr,1n 
had 14. 

UCSD advanced to the Final Fourwith wins overGutavus Adolphus 
College (0-0, 3-1 on penalty kicks), Co lorado College (1-0) and 
Roanoke COl1ege (2-1 in OT). 

Kenyon College: Division Ill's top-ranked men's soccerteam, the 
Lords were undefeated during the regular season (13-0-4) and were co· 
champions in the North Coast Athletic Conference. . 

Junior forward Mark Phillips, who has scored 24 goals in 20 games 
and has amassed a total of 57 points, sparks the impressive Kenyon 
offense. Senior defender Andrew Guest has also been an offensi ve 
threat. totaling 27 points. 

The Lords are no slouches on defense either, allowing only 14 goals 
this year. 

Kenyon defeated Wittenburg University (2-1), Ohio Wesleyan 
University (2-1) and the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh (2-0) to 
advance to the Final Four.

Tritons visit Penn. in 
NCAA Final Four 
Continued from page 9 

last Saturday in Geneva, New 
York, with the 40 degree tempera-
ture and bitter cold winds taking 
their toll on the warm-weather lov-
ing Tritons. 

The men's squad runs a very 
similar offense to the women -
kicking balls long and utilizing its 
blazing speed to chase them down 
and center to the trailers. Poor field 
conditions and swirling windscould 
put a serious damper on that game 
plan. 

"I hope that the weather will be 
kind to us. Most of the kids don't 
have cleats. I hope the footwork 
doesn't cost us," Armstrong said. 
"We'll make adjustments if we have 
to. We have built enough experi-
ence [throughout the year] to do 
so." 

"It is the conditions that affect 
the kids the most," Armstrong 0b-
served. "Players react differently to 
unknown factors, but I think we 

should be all right. We've got a 
good group of kids. Of the playoff 
games we've played, we have got-
ten stronger every one. Hopefully 
this will continue next weekend." 

The Tritons biggest problem wi II

midfielder Joel KosaJcoff, who ag-
gravated his groin in Sunday's match. 
Armstrong is unsure ifKosakoffwil1 
be able to play Saturday, but in any 
case it is safe to say that he will not be 
100% healthy. Kosakoff is also re-
covering from an ankle injury he 
suffered which sidelilled him for three 
weeks early this season. 

"[Kosakoff) is probably the best 
skills player we have," goalie 
Michael Madden said. "Even an in-
jured loel Kosakoff will help us 
[tremendously]." 

Kenyon College, 1993 co·cham-
pions of the North Coast Athletic 
Conference. defeated last year's 
NCAA Champion. Ohio Wesleyan. 
in second-round action. The Lords 
possess a strong offense, led by jun-
ior forward Mark Phillips. Phillips 
has launched 105 shots in 20 games 
for an incredible 2.85 points per 

game average. He has accumulated 
57 points on the year. 

"We know they have a decent 
offense," Madden said. "[But, lour 
defense has been amazi ng. When 
we have really needed to mark spe-
cific [players], when there is some-
one that we can pinpoint, I can't 
remember a game in which that per· 
son scored:' 

Case in point, UCSD' s defensive 
corp of Nick Terleckey, Matt Chilton, 
Ken Bums and Jay Newcomer com-
pletely shutdown Roanoke leading 
scorer Dustin Fonder, who had a~cu­
mulated 22 goals and 20 ~ssists in 23 
games (64 points). 

"We have come up against pretty 
much everything," Chilton said. 
''They can't be that l11uch betterthan 
what we have already faced . We' ve 
got to win the headers. They are a 
big team and they are always look-
ing for knockdowns to [Phillips1." 

Chilton summed up the team's 
outlook: "Everybody is going on 
drive right now. Hopefully the 
weather will be good and the tield 
will be in good condition. We all 
think we can do it ."

SWIMMING AND DIVING: UCSD men's swimming squad looks to challenge 
Kenyon College for national title, women's team undergoes rebuilding year 
By Ken Perlman 
Senior Sports Writer 

The NCAA is an organization 
rich in sports tradition. From the 
golden domed helmets of Notre 

niche in history, 

Dame foot-
ball to the 
acerbic wit of 
Bob b y 
Knight and 
his Indiana 
Hoosiers, 
those who 
grace the are-
nas of inter-
collegiate 
athletics are 
on a constant 
mission to de· 
fine their 

This year, the UCSD men's and 
women's swimming and diving 
teams are trying to add their own 
legacy to collegiate sports as they 
strive to establish a reputation for 
pride and winning. 

"We're proud to be one of the 
best teams in the country," UCSD 
swimming Head Coach Doug Boyd 

said. 'This is the best team [' ve 
ever had." 

The quest to build a lasting im-
pression on the world of collegiate 
swi mming is a daunting task chock-
full of pressure. However, Boyd 
asserts that UCSD's approach is 
just the opposite. 

"Our goals are basically to have 
fun during the year and swim as 
well as we can and dive as well as 
we can," Boyd said, but he also 
emphasized that UCSD is working 
toward some definite goals. 

This season could be an histori-
cal one for the men's team. The 
Tritons return almost every swim-
mer from last season and have per-
haps their best shot ever at dethron-
ing Kenyon College's Division III 
swimming dynasty. 

The Lords are the most success-
ful team in intercollegiate athletic 
history, capturing a record 15 con-
secuti ve titles in Division III men' 
swimming. 

"The only reason I'm here is to 
win a league championship," se-
nior co-captain Travis Miller said. 
"[To beat Kenyon] is the reason 

thatI'm still around." 
Miller, who set two national 

records in the 2oo-yard individual 
medley and the 200-yard back· 
stroke, admitted that establishing a 
strong Triton reputation for win· 
ning is important. "There wasn't 
really any tradition when I got here," 
he said. "We're trying to develo~ 
some tradition. It increases perfor. 
mance in the pool." 

The squad has been training in· 
tensely so far this season, logging 
yard upon yard at a furious pace. 
"We're a Division III team th at 
trains like a Division I team," Boyd 
said. 

So far the grueling workout~ 
have paid off. The men made an 
impressive showing la st week at 
Arizona State. Freshman Edward 
Ruth swam hi s way to u 4: IS.OC 
in the 400-yard 1M and posted a 
2:02.00 in the 200-yard butter· 
fly . 

"[Ruth] will be a three·time All· 
American," said Boyd of his im· 
pressive young swimmer.

Tritons Stick It To USC, UCLA 
FENCING: UCSD's men's and women's teams post victories over USC and 
UCLA, Lawson remains undefeated in men's foil competition this year 
By Dan Kraft 
GUSI'd/an Reporter 

The Triton men's and women's 
fencing team has made itself right at 
home in Cal State University Long 

Beach's gym 
this year. 

Last Satur-
day, tJCSD 
traveled to 
Long Beach 
for the second 
consecuti ve 
week to battle 
fellow swash-
bucklers 
UCLA and 
USC. 

The women's squad barely edged 
out UCLA by a score of 9-7, but had 
little trouble dispensing with the la-
dies of Troy, quellin, the Trojan 
invasion wilh a dominating 15-1 
petfonnance, 

The men also experienced little 
difficulty with the Trojans, defeat-
ing them 20-7. However, the Bru-
ins posed a tougher challenge to 
the Tritons, who rose to the occa-
sion posting a convincing 17-10 
victory. 

UC San Diego's Rich Liu, Tom 
Powell, and Gabe Lawson performed 
oUlStandin.gly, all going 6-0 on the 
day. 

Liu, competing in the lightening-
quick sabre division, led the Tri-
tons' winning effort. UCSD's fine 
outing should move it up from its 
previous fifth ranking in Ihe divi-
sion. 

The men's sabre pounded UCLA 
and USC by scores of 7-2 and 8-1, 
respectively. 

"I was very pleased with our sa-
bre team. They really came through 
lind performed excellently for us," 
UCSD Head Coach Lisa Posthumus 

said. 
Lawson and Powell led [he 

men's foil contingent, which main-
tained its commanding lead in the 
conference. Lawson has nOl felt the 
agony of defeat yet this season and 
has his coach looking down the road 
toward bigger challenges. 

"( was very happy with 
[Lawson'sl performance. I'm hop-
ing for an NCAA bid for him," 
Posthumus said. 

The Tritons inex perienced Illen' ~ 
epee team fought hard. but were 
forced to swallow tWO tough losses 
by identical scores of 4-5. 

Nevertheless, their performance 
kept UCSD in close quarters with 
the Bruins and Trojans, allowing 
rheir more e)(perienced teammates 
to bring home victory. 

The Tritons will return to Long 
Beach once again on Saturday, Nov. 
20 to clash with Santa Barbara.

HOOPS: UCSD 
opens vs. Pomona 
Continued from Pac- 9 
Pomona-Pitzer at the Main Gym at 
7 p.m. 

The changes in the team were a 
necessary adjustment, Marshall said. 
"We have a different kind of athlete 
this year, guys that are very athletic 
with great speed and quickness." 

To take advantage of the new 
team makeup, Marshall designed the 
offense from scratch during the 
offseason, while Assistant Coach 
Mark Aumann drew up the defense. 

Inaddition, the Tritons also boast 
terrific team depth. "If you have 
nine players that are almost the same, 
you have a deep team. We have IS, 
and with 15 guys, I can run you to 
death," Marshall said. 

Offensively, UCSD will be run-
ning, but don't stan mentioning the 
Tritons and Loyola Marymount in 
the same breath. "We don't want to 
take the quick shot. We' re going to 
make the defense work," Marshall 
said. "We do have some shooters 
that have a green light, but only 
within the confines of our offense." 

Defensively, "we're going to be 
in their face the entire time. We will 
harass them and force them to make 
errors," the coach said. 

All of this conb'olled chaos will 
be led by senior point guard Rodney 
Lusain, who is"as good as there is in 
the nation. I would be hard-pressed 
to believe that there are three point 
guards bener than him in the coun-
try. He's the total package at point 
guard," Marshall said. 

Running with Lusain will be se-
nior guards Nate Hantgin and Erik 
Johnson. Hantgin, a transfer who 
arrived last year, has "as much coun 
awareness and anticipation as any

out-touched his competitors in the 
50-yard freestyle (21.70) while 
Miller pulled away from the pack 
to win the 200-yard backstroke 
(I :57.60). 

This weekend, the Tritons will 
fly nonh to Palo Alto to take on the 
nation'S best team - Stanford. 

While Boyd admits that it is 
likely the Cardinal williopple the 
Tritons, he argues that UCSD has a 
more important goal- gearing up 
for December's Speedo Cup, for 
which many Triton men will shave 
down in hopes of achieving NCAA 
Division 1II qualifying times. 

On the other side of the pool, the 
UCSD women's team has some 
growin~ to do. Though the Tritons 
return senior co-captains Laurie 
Boyd, Allison Dunn and Christiana 
Galdos, the women have a young

Sharpshooting senior ErIk Johnson will provide strong leadership, 
player I've ever had," Marshall said. 

Johnson may not have Lusain's 
a/ld Hantgin's speed, but his reputa-
tion as a shooter is unmatched in the 
annals of Triton basketball. Marshall 
is also counting on the senior to 
provide some strang leadership both 
on the floor and off. 

UCSD' sbiggest player is Stefano 
Bernasconi. a 6'9", 235-poundjun-
ior transfer from Switzerland. "He's 
a typical European player in that he 
has to learn how to play with his 
back to the basket. But he's i m-
proved in the two weeks he's beel) 
with the program," Marshall said. 

Boyd has a realistic outlook for 
the women's chances to knock off 
10-time defending champion 
Kenyon College. 

"Kenyon is the strongest it's ever 
been [in women's swimming)," 
Boyd said. " It is a rebuilding year 
for us." 

While this season's early dual 
meet with UCLA proved less than 
successful, the lady Tritons did per-
form well at Arizona State. 

Freshman Heather McPherson 
pulled out a time of 2:00.00 in the 
200-yard freestyle, while teammate 
Carrie Parker swam 2: 15.00 and 
I :03.8 in the 200- and 100-yard 
backstroke, respectively. 

Galdos was also impressive. 
swimming the I DO-yard butterfly 
in I :01.00 and the 2oo-yard fly in 
2: 15.9. 

HWe have a small team but 
they're really hard workers," Boyd 
said of his squad. "We really have 
no stars. We have 14 girls, seven or 
eight of which I would say are re-
ally good - good being a top-eight

UCSD has a month to get the 
new game working. Staning Dec. 
20, the Tritons play asix-game swing 
that will "make or break our sea-
son," according to Marshall. Three 
of those six contests wi II be agai nst 
nationally ranked teams: Calvin, a 
preseason number one in everal 
polls, along with Cal Lutheran and 
Millikin, both top-team squads. 

Afterthose six, the Tritons' play-
off destiny will already be in focus. 
"If we're 10-4 after Jan. 8, then 
we're in great shape," Marshall said. 
"We'recapableofdoingit, but we're 
going to need some luck." 

swimmer. The rest are on the thresh-
old." 

The UCSD divers also look to 
establish themselves as the nation's 
best this season. Head Coach Mike 
Fitchett admits that last year's sea-
son will be tough to tap for the 
women, who had four divers in the 
top eight in the one-meter and three-
meter boards. 

Fitchett hopes that freshman 
Kristi Young will be a major force 
for the Triton divers this season. 
Young teams up with Jill Jackson 
and julie Gold tein, who both re-
turn for their finnl season as Triton 
divers. 

"We're the top dogs in the Divi· 
sion," Fitchett said of his team. 

The nlt.n· s team is led by two 
junior college tran fers, Josh Curtis 
and Tim Saylor. 

Captain Adam Burgasser led

taking third place in the one-meter

UCSD Looks To Qualify for NCAAs 
WATER POLO: Tritons travel north to Sacramento for WWPA Championships 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Considering the experience and 
talent UCSD men's water polo Head 
Coach Denny Harper has at his fin-

the mighty Tritons. 

gertips. travel-
ing north to 
Sacramento for 
this weekend's 
Western Water 
Polo Associa-
tion (WWPA) 
Championships 
is almost more 
of a chore than 
lhedrowningof 
unfortunate 
teams that are 
forced to face 

UCSD faces UC Riverside early 
Friday morning and if the game turns 
out anything like their earlier en-
counters, Harper must be shaking in 
his shoes. 

The TritonlHighlander rivalry 
has always produced big games and 
lots of scoring. Unfortunately for

of the Redlands-Chaminade game 
on Saturday. UCSD has beaten 
Chaminade at the NorCal Tourna· 
ment at UC Berkeley earlier this 
season by a score of 16-7 and has 
dismantled Redlands, 16-6, at the 
Baldy View Invitational at 
Claremont College. A 32-13 scor-
ing differential has plagued Harper 
and his players with many a sleep-
less nightcontemplatingjust how to 
counter such a devastating arsenal. 

According to Harper, should San 
Diego. by some heavenly interven-
tion, advance to the championship 
game on Sunday, it would most 
likely face the winner of the UC 
Davis-Air Force matchup. The Tri-
tons trounced Davis twice this year 
by a total score of 29·14. Surely, 
they are sweating bullets. 

Air Force, however, has actually 
played the Tritons tough - once. 
The host Falcons topped UCSD at 
the U.S. Air Force Academy Invita-
tional, 14-12, in asudden·death over-
time dogfight on Sept. 24, but have 
not flown even close to those heights 
since. In their four meetings, the 
Tritons have won three and have 
outscored Air Force 55-37. 

"They got their fluke win," 
Harper said after the contest. "Deep 
down they know we are a far better 
team." 

So in whallooks like a foregone 
conclusion before the WWPA Tour-
nament even kicks off, the Tritons 
will probably have to jettison the 
likes of Air Force for the champion-

ship. The winner Hutoillutically 
qualifie sixth for the NCAA Na-
tional Champion~hips, Nov. 26-28. 

"We are not too focused on our 
opponents. Most ly we are concen-
trating on our work ethic." Harper 
said. "We ha ve 10 pound out three 
games in a row, Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday. We have to go in with 
some intensity. The only way we are 
going to lose this weekend is if we 
beat ourselves." 

Air Force has been in the UCSO-
spoiler position before. The Fal-
cons gave the Tritons a run for their 
money at last year's WWPAs. 
UCSD barely won the game in 
double ovenime. 

"We don't want [that] to happen 
again," Harper said. "But playing in 
one game a day is different than 
playing after two or three games in 
the same day. We shOUld detinitely 
win it. If we don't, it would be a bad 
thing." 

The Tritons will again have the 
services of left -hander Sean 
Kinghorn, who has been recovering 
from an earlier shoulder injury. 

"[Kinghorn) has worked real hard 
in rehab and everyone is amazed 
with his recovery. He could be in a 
wheelchair and he would sti ll play." 
Harper said of the freshly mohawked 
senior. ' 

"It is good to have [Kinghorn] 
back," senior co-captain Ricky 
Romero said. "I'm not too worried 
about [WWPAs). Wejusthavetobe 
ready to play."

QUAINT: New 
England health food, 
bricks and barns 
Continued from page 9 

I can't imagine playing a soccer 
game in that kind of cold. In soccer 
you move around a lot, but r kept 
waiting for the players to start living 
that scene from TermifUlror 2, where 
the evil Terminator freezes and shat-
ters while trying to walk. 

On a completely unrelated point, 
I would like to point out that William 
Smith is the all-female universi ty 
half of the Hobart-William Smith 
Colleges alliance. Now I pose this 
question to all you men out there -
would you attend an all-male school 
named something like Doris 
Applebaum COllege? 

Anotherthing I didn't understand 
about William Smith and upstate New 
York is this fascination with bricks. 
Everything back there is made of 
bricks. yet they have a surplus of 
trees. What's wrong with wood? 

Along with bricks. barns are an-
other big part of being "quaint." If 
you don't have a bam, your quaint-
ness level is just not where it could 
be. The barn doesn't even have to be 
in good shape. Remember, another 
synonym for quaint is "rustic." I 
shouldn't have to warn you about

THE 8J'S SPORTS 
QUIZ IS BACK! . 

Every Thursday 

this word. You don 't find too many 
uses for "rustic" out west - usually 
we just say "condemned ." 

Our hotel for the weekend was 
the Friendship Inn (motto: "Your 
room may be a closet, bUI the TV 
doesn't work either!',) in Farnlington, 
about 45 minutes east of Rochester. 
Next to the Friendship Inn wa a 
place to eat called the Park Place 
Restuarant. 

This brings us to the next differ-
ence between New England and the 
West Coast. There is a whole differ-
ent attitude about healthy eating and 
the like. 

There were things on the menu at 
the Park Place r haven 't seen for 
years. They had real bacon, the kind 
of tuff that comes from pigs. Not 
only that, but they offered bacon, 
sausage and eggs 011 the .wlIle plate. 
It was enough to start my heart palpi -
tating just looking at it. Health food 
to an East Coaster. it turns out, is a 
dish with the extra salt served on the 
side. 

One of the parents asked if Park 
Place had any fruit. The look in the 
waitress' eyes said, "What do you 
think orange juice is for?" but she 
controlled her laughter long enough 
to say no. l'1lI pretty su re there is a 
non-smoking section somewhere in 
town, but it's probably the gas sta-
tion.

HIATUS 2 The UCSD Guardian Thu"sday Novl'lIlhcr 1&. L993 

By Jenny WreM 
Guardian Reporter 

It is truly a rare thing when a 
successful novel survives the haz-
ardous transformation into a suc-
cessful film. Too often, the subtle-
ties and nuances of a written work 
are lost in the transition, and the 
end result is a film that is a stripped-
down, tidied up, barely recogniz-
able version of the author's origi-
nal idea. 

Fortunately, rhe Rema;IIso/the 
Day, the new film by the Academy 
Award-winning Merchant/Ivory 
team (HolVard 's EIld) is one of 
those exquisite rarities - a beauti-
fully wrought film which delicately 
preserves the emotions and com-
plexities ofKazuo Ishiguro's novel. 

FILM 

to watch as Stevens temporarily 
reunites with Miss Kenton after 20 
years, and then returns to the incar-
cerating, decaying walls of 
Darlington Hall. 

Hopkins is at hi s best as the 
rigid , orderly Stevens. His face is 
nn unreadable, unemotional mask 
which berraysonly what he chooses 
to reveal. Thompson, in il perfor-
mance of award-winning caliber, 
is nothing short of brilliant as the 
long-suffering Miss Kenton. The 
two are supported by commend-
able performances from Christo-
pher Reeve as 1I wealthy American 
congressman and Tim Pigott-Smith 
as Mr. Benn, the man who pro-
vides Miss Kenton with an escape 
from her confining worlel. 

Adapted by Ruth Prawer 
Jhabvala, the film chronicles the 
service-oriented life of Stevens 
(Anthony Hopkins), the emotion-
ally-repressed, dignity-obsessed 
butler at Darlington Hall, and Miss 
Kenton (Emma Thompson), the 
young woman who becomes 
Darlington HaWs housekeeper. 
Their relationship does not develop 
into a traditional romance. Stevens 
is incapable of escaping the claus-
trophobic realm of his profession, 
and he can only express his emo-
tions on a purely proper, business-

Anthony Hot*Ins ..... Emma Thompson porIr8y servants In JlIe R ...... of the lMy. 

The scenes in which Hopkins 
and Thompson are paired together 
are unmistakably the best anelmost 
intense of the mill. In these emo-
tionally charged confrontations, 
true cinematic magic is wrought. 
The unexpected chemistry that ex-
ists between Thompson and 
Hopkins lasts until the final, heart-
breaking scenes of the film. 

In addition to denying his feel-
ings for Miss Kenton, Stevens is 
also unable to confront the bitter 
truth concerning Lord Darlington 
(James Fox), the "great man" whom 

he so unquestioningly serves and 
to whom he gives the best years of 
hi, life. 

through a series of flashbacks, he 
begins to suspect that his life - so 
centered on serving others - has, 
perhaps, not been lived to its full-
est. This awakening is devastating 

The Remains o/the Day is show-

Cinemas. For more information,

MU SIC 

Dionysian Rock 
RHINE: 'We are 
avid book people' 
Continued from pae. Hi 
of step with what was happening 
today. But I like the idea of intro-
spection, a certain poetic flair and 
maybe a sensitivity to traditional 
beauty. 

up, created something mysterious 
about the whole process. Because 
we have small-town roots, to be 
able to go down to Nashville and 
take over a studio was exciting. 
The liner notes and press 
biography of the band are 
very Immaculate, almost 
like art pieces In them· 
selves. What were your 
loals In puttlnl these Items 
together? 

Local poet will peiform with heal .r m£tal band On the one hand, sometimes I 
feel that the concept of one new 
band is so incredibly boring. But 
when we started the group we felt 
we had something unique to say. I 
suppose that's one thing about 
humanity in general- sometimes 
we have this desire to get up on a 
soapbox and say a few words about 
our fellow beings. 

By Mel .... Jacobs 
Staff Writer 

Dr. Ron Shane, a local 
rock-poet, thinks of his musi-
cal performances as a way of 
changing a modem society he 
thinks is materialistic. Shane 
and Insurrection, his heavy 
metal band, will present a per-
formance of music, theater and 
art at the Che Cafe at 9 p.m. 
tonight. The presentation will 
fea ture se lec tions from 
Shane's five-volume work 
Diollysian Apocalypse. 

Shane's performance will 
celebrate the completion of 
the first five books of 
Diol/ysian Apocalypse, his in-
terpretation of John Milton' s 
Paradise Lost, an epic poem 
based on the story of the fall 
of Adam and Eve. 

Inarecent interview, Shane 
said that people still "fall from 
grace" as a result of a capital-
ist society which encourages 
people to place money and 
power above spiritual values. 

"Through art, the creative, 
artistic spirit of the self must 
be strengthened to overcome 
the damaging, oppressive ef-
fects of modern society," 
Shane said. 

Shane said he uses his art 
tocommunicate and produce. 
positive change through 
peaceful means. 

Shane, who has an exten-
sive background in psychol-
ogy, anthropology and litera-
ture, conducted his post-doc-
toral studies at UCLA in Re-
nai sance Literature and The-
atre. Since graduate school, 
Shane has been fascinated 
with early Greek theater and 
uses the style of the ancient 
Greeks as a framework for 
his present performance. 

Shane's interests are not 
just academic. He holds a 
black belt in Tae Kwon Do 
and studies ballet. He has also 
completed over 80 written 
works, including five screen-
plays. Currently, he is a pro-
fessor at Grossmon! and 
Miramar Community Col -
leges and has directed and 
choreographed numerous 
television and theater produc-
tions. 

Shane will recite at 9 p.m. 
tonightatlheCheCafe, where 
he has performed twice in the 
past. Admission is free . FOI

Dr. Ron Shane wll perform a rock 
rendition of John MIHon's epic 
poem Parlldl .. Lost. 

Some of our new material is not 
as soothing, although it is cer-
tainly not grunge. It' s similar to 
the way that Tom Waits has the 
ability to kick someone in the shin 
in a friendly way. Part of the qui-
etness on Patiellce was the fact 
that we were recording it ourselves 
and we could not get guitar sounds 
that didn't sound like they were 
being played under water. We 
couldn' t give the guitars a lot of 
life. 

It's not to say that we hated the 
project, but we were willing to let 
it grow. 
Can you talk about the reo 
cording process that took 
place with Patience? It 
sounds like H was almost a 
religious experience. 

We do try to think of it as a 
ritual. Obviously, we are not the 
first musicians to record at night, 
but showing up in a strange city to 
start to record at 10 at night and 
finish upwhen the sun was coming 

TIIUIlSDAY

We did want to renect the fact 
that we are avid book people in the 
presentation of the band . Every-
thing we sent out that was relevant 
to Over the Rhine we try to make 
into a tiny bit of art. The question 
is 'does it come across as bei ng too 
precious or pretentious'?' I don't 
know how any artist can function 
without being pretentious on a 
certain level. You're drawing at-
tention to yourself and a lot of art 
is assuming a character. I have 
chosen not to worry about it too 
much. 

We don't own a computer, and 
we try to keep the feel of a cottage 
industry. That's the philosophy I 
want to adhere to. 
Sonls such as ··Jacksle," 
"I've Been Slipping" and "I 
Painted My Name" concern 
unrequited love. Are you a 
hopeless romantic? 

Part of all that [concern with 
romance] is a metaphor for aspira-
tions and dreams. I guess growing 
up in a fairly sec luded environ-
ment, if you have a desire to be 
creative, there is a desire to tind an 
audience. A lot of the love . ongs 
are a metaphor for trying to dis-
cover a life with which you can be 
satisfied.
