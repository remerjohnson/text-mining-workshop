The apPointment wa subsequently 
nullified and then confirmed at an April 
17 MCC Student Manpower Committee 
mpeting 

According to omm Board appointee 
Wp ndy Ma kay , MCC ommittee 
mpmb r Lee Burke approached her 
dUring the first week of the Spring 
quarter and said, " there are om-
pll(ations, and we have to open up the 
pmlt lon to all Muir College student, but 
don't worry about it becau e essentially, 

~ou have the position ." Lee Burk told 
Ihp Tnton Times, " it's basi cally the ame 
mC's'>agl' " 

Mackay also said that Lee Burk and 
cott Thayer, another MCC ommittee 

m mber, said that she was qualified to 
hold the Comm . Board position, and they 
supported her fully. 

In an MCC Committee meeting on 
Monday Apri l 15, members Renne 
Berryman, Lee Burke, and Scott Thayer, 
with a 'nay' and an 'aye' proxy vote from 
Bill Kolstad and Steve Woods respec-
tively , officia ll y appointed Wendy 
Mackay to the Communications Board. 

At the time of the appointment, only 
three of ix applicants had been con-
tacted, and two of the three, which 
Included Ma kay, were poken to by 
Me tudent Manpower Committee 
m('mber 

r ufu Biftu , Leo 0 John, Lee Powell , 
'rank Longo, Debra Sherman who ap-
plied formally, and Wendy Mackay who 
did not, were the appl icants. 

A complaint wa registered by Bill 
Kolstad against the proceedings. Lee 
Burke, with whom the complaint was 
registered aid, " he (Kolstad) felt that 

qual consideration cou ld not have been 
possibly given to all candidates " Ac-
cording to Burke, " his complaint wa 

nough to nullify the proceedings " 
Another meeting was held on W d-

nesday, Apnl 17. At that meeting, only 
three of the six applicants were present 
to voice their desires for the pOSition 
After extensive voting procedures, which 
were formulated at that meeting, there 
was a fifty-fifty split vote between Frank 
Longo and Wendy Mackay when Lee 
Powell withdrew his appl ication for the 
Comm Board position . MCC Committee 
members said a decision would be made 
expeditiously and the meeting was 
adjourned. According to Burke, the MCC 
Committee met that night around 10:00 
p.m . and Wendy Mackay was appointed 
with a vote of four-one-one. Lee Burke 
abstained because he said, "several 
people questioned a previous bias." 

The pOSition was opened to Muir 
College students during the week of April 
8-12. 

On April 12, Bill Kolstad, Lee Burke, 
and Muir College Dean Him Beckley 
decided tlTat applicants would be 
contacted over the weekend for a 
" t lephone creening process."

l!OO~ITICS: JAMES SOlO I 
Props Five and Nine 

California State Senate Pro-Tem Jim Mills [D-San 
Diego) ended a 600 mile bicycle trip last Saturday 
symbolizing his support for Proposition Five in the 
upcoming June primary. Mills is just one of the many 
state politicians supporting the measure. 

Proposition I ive will permit the u e of state gasoline 
taxes to be used for the construction of mass transit 

'ystem~ . Presently all state gasoline taxes must be used 
lor the con truction of new roads and the maintenance 
of existing roads 
• Proposition rive and Proposition Nine which deal~ 

with campaign financing management, has received the 
lion' share of press coverage and interest. Although 
Proposition Nine has had strong opposition from a large 
number of group~, Proposition Five has managed to stay 
he fore the public f'ye despite having almost universal 
Clcceptance. 

Among the people supporting Proposit ion hW! are 
Mayor Pete Wilson, State Senator Jim Mills, the 
California AFL-CIO, the Legislative Council of the 
California Team~ters , the Sierra Club, the Cities of San 
I rancisco, Lo Angeles, and San Diego, and all the 
Republican and Democratic candidates for Governor. 

To date there has been no organized opposition to 
the Prooosition . However, according to Mike Hershfeld, 
the Southern California Automobile Association of 
Amprica may come out again t the mass tran It 
referendum although nothing is official yet 
San Francisco Mayor Jo eph Alioto DemocratIC Can-
didate for Governor Will be in San Diego tonight and 
tomorrow . Tonight at 7 p.m , Alioto will be at a Dinner 
Dance hosted by the "Chicanos for Alioto" at the Le 
Baron Hotel in Mission Valley Tomorrow he will speak 
at a ~en ior citizens breakfast and a reception at hiS 
South Ea t San Diego Headquarters. 

The latest Mervyn rield Cali fornia Poll hows that 
frontrunners Ed Reinecke and Gerry Brown have slipped 
in the past month Brown, the Democratic candidate, 
has fallen from a high of 52 percent last year to 19 
percent today Bob Moretti and Joseph Alioto are close 
behind with 1b p rcent and 15 percent respectively . 
Baxter Ward has been moving up fast and has risen to b

I did observe that the 
campus was quieter at that

had noted thiS were unable 
to account for Its being so I 
said fur ther that students 
appeared to us to be no less 
concerned about the great 
issues co nfrontin g our 
society but they eemed to 
despair of doing anything 
about them . I remarked that

To Whom It May Con-
cern, 

I would like to thank the 
housi ng administration for 
their careful screeni ng of 
those persons who par-
ticipitated in the room 
draw .. It is due to this 
careful creenlng that I 
[who live In San rrancisco) 
am out of a room next 
quarter, and my room mate 
(who liv Ie s than 25 miles 
away) has a room 

I don 't mind not drawing 
a room, if there weren 't any 
room left L1ut when one of 
tho e rooms is taken by 
someone who e home is an 
easy ten minute drive from 
campus, I feel that the 
space has been was ted . 

However,di stance to home 
does not come into con-
sideration when making the 
room draw. That'! why I will 
have to expend con-
siderable time and money 
this summ r looking for a 
place to live for next year . 

I have no fe-course, no

Trespass· Genesis, ABC Records 

I still maintain that Genesis is one of the finest 
unrecognized bands in the business, though it seems 
recognition is coming to them fast and furiously. Along With 
this recognition, a certain amount of searching for ear/ier 
material has begun and so its no surprise that ABC Record! 
has released this 1970 recording of the band . 

What's exc iting here, is that unl ike many of these "early 
recordings by ... " type album , this album does not at all 
ound like primitive roots . It i as solid an album as their 

recent material in all respects. 
Genesis is compared quite a bit to Yes in terms of the 

similar structure of their mu ic and band, and thi s album 
offers an enlightening insight to the fact that the bands 
growth is not one of influence by Yes, but rather a ort of 
parallel growth. 

Genesis, like Yes, is an extended song, complicated in-
strumentation style. Genesis, while working in the same tighl 
band arrangement as Yes, is less symphonic, however, and 

laces more emphasis on solo instruments as they weave 
rough the complex arrangements. 
The one chief advantage Genesis has over Ye is a lightly 

instrumental variety, adding flute, ce llo, accord ian, 
Icimer and the like to their complex compositions . But 

' ' ''lmn' n comparisons, each band has its own flavor; I merely 
inue the comparison to encourage Yes fans to give a 

listen to thi S f'xcellf'nt h;tnd . 
" Trespass" is an excit ing album rich in In· 

rumentailtextural <1ualities and fine vocals . Particuliarl\ 
are an engrossing " Looking for Someone", and the 

ri ghtening strength of "Knife" 
While I ss epi odic than thei r recent work , " Tre pass" I 

provide, th e sam ' high quality musical experi ence which II 
rapidly be oming associat d with Gene is 

Deodalo / Airto In Concert , CTI Records 

My complaint wi th D odato ha always been how .. tIle 
bound he has found him~elf . I m('an, anyonE' who (ould make 

Iso pra h Zarathu tra" sou nd like "Rhapsody In Blue" ha 
bviously got a problem 

So one must welcomp th is npw live album at least on the 
level of having d different ~oll nd to it No Also prach ~ound 
to it thank goodness (oh, how hits ca n corrupt) . 

It's a pecu liar album In that half of the material I Deodato's 
and half i Airto's and the album jacket doe n' t even clearl\ 
make the dist inction as to who's material is what. 0/11 
li stening through however doe make it clear as the 111 0 
performers are as different as day and night 

As for the'O odato side of things, the mat rial i pleasanl 
bu t nothing too incredible His arrangement of Steely 

Dan's "Do It Again" ha a nice big band feel 10 it, but th e solo\ 
certainly non·inspirat ional. His "Spirit of Summer" omrl 

f sounding like nothing so much as a movie ~oundtrack 
Deodato may be an interesting arranger (and this only 

accordin g to your taste for Latin influenced jazz-rock) but as a 
soloist he leaves a lotIo be desired. John Tropea's gUitar solo\ 
aren't bad at all , and 'on " Tropea" he puts out a few nl 
moments, but as for Deodato's keyboards ... 

The inclusion of Airto's Brazillian brand of ca t-slngmg (,l~ I 
can th ink of no better way to describe It) makes a ni ce cha 
of pace on the album, but not a whole lot mor 

In the end I susp ct it all makes relat ively plea,an: 
li stening, but if such a thing as Latin -jau-rock·mu)ak \\,1 
pOSS ible, thiS album would ertain ly be m ther dmongst II

Hooked On A FeefinR • Blue Swede, Capital Records 

Oh, the ultimate humiliation ... finding oneself reviewing 
one of those records that was born via a.m. top-40 radio . I 
refer of course to that now infamous ooga-c hakka rendition of 
I.l .J. Thomas's old hit "Hooked on A Feeling" which permeated 
the radio all last month . 

Seems everyone was talking about the record , whether they 
liked it or not, as its unusual gorilla-l ike interpretation seems 
to demand more than a casual listening. What made that 
arra ngement so successful (it seemed to me) was the use of 
the reggae rhythm throughout the record which gave it an 
incredibly catchy air about it. 

Well, if you liked or were amused by the ingenuity that 
we nt into that ingle, you' ll be pleased to find that Blue 
Swede has an entire album of tunes available. While not all 
ooga·chakb, the album is mostly old tunes thaI have been 
rearranged . What makes this album work so well is that the 
arrangements are all excellent and ingenious. They have taken 
the top-40 tune, and modernized it into a more popular rhyth-
m and instrumental flavor. Among the material on the album 
" a reggae flavored rendition of Jose reliciano's " Destiny", 
the s la ;~ing of a strong electric gui tar down beat through an 
old fi rst edition hit " Something's Burning", an energet ic and 
.,a tisfyi ng up-tempo rendition of the Associations " Never My 
love" and a humorous approach on "Working in the Coal 
Mine" With those gorill a voices hanting one, two, one, two, 
three, four. through the song. 

The original material on the album work just as well, with 
all the popu lar influences of song-style being taken and 
.. lightly tran formed to a slightly higher plane. 

The result of all th i carefu l machination is that Blu Swede 
has taken the t' l elTlE'nt~ of nosta lgia and injec ted Int o tllPm an

Theatre: 

A phenomenal production of 
" Tartuffe" opened April 18 at the 
UCSD Theatre. The cast is superb , 
the set is impressive, and it looks as 
if Eric Christmas' " Tartuffe" will be 
dmong the most important and 
exciti ng events in theatre in San 
Diego this year . 

Tartuffe, the central figure i n 
Moliere's comedy, nearly succeeds 
in seducing the wife a'nd gaining 
possession of the house of his host 
Orgon . Tartuffe enacts his devious 
schemes while posing as a spiritual 
master . The play revolves around 
the attempts of argon's family to 
open hi s eyes to the base nature of 
Tartuffe . Their efforts cu lm inate in 
the hilarious seduction scene in 
whi ch Elmire pretends to en· 
courage Tartuffe's advances in 
o rder to expose him as a fraud to 
her husband . 

Ri chard Wi/bur's tran slation 
retains the beauty of Molere's l ines 
while bringing a clarity which 
greatly enhances the accessibilityof 
the 17th century com edy to a 
modern audience. 

Eric Chri stmas is outstanding as 
Tartuffe. His head is fascinatingly 
bald, his wicked eyes dart back and 
forth from the earthly delights of 
cleavage, to Ie Ciel, and always 
back to temptations f leshy. Every 

Aart-Vark 
continued from pilllle 4 

Tartuffe 
gesture is deliberate and masterful 
Arthur W agner plays argon With an 
incredible range of emotion . After 
each powerful explosion of anger 
hi s lovable smile returns We adopt 
the attitude of Orgon's family and 
adore him In spite of his 
foolishness Michael Addison plays 
a terribly erudite Cleante, as 
balanced and cerebral as Orgon is 
extrem e and impulSive. 

"Tartuffe" lends Itself well to the 
mixed cast of both students and 
i nstructors . The outstanding 
professional actors are well -
supported by the students cast 10 
minor roles. Robyn Hunt is good as 
Elmire, especia lly in the hidden· 
husband - l istens· to- wife - with· 
another scene with argon and 
Tartuffe. Chris Canaan gives a fine 
performance as the young Valere 
The best minor role goes to the 
maid Dorine Marie Chiment plays 
Dorine with just the right amount 
of bawdiness 

Eric Christmas ' surety of 
direction is what makes "Tartuffe" 
deserving of such praise. He IS free 
to develop those moments in the 
drama that have caugh t hiS fancy 
precisely because he IS building on 
such a very so lid foundation Thus, 
scenes such as Tartuffe and Organ 
fa ll ing to the floor in one another's

Pal. 5 Triton Times. April :z., 1974 



Netters Intprove; 
Head for Ojai 

On the courts Tuesday 
afternoon, UCSD met with 
SDSU for the second time 
this season . Th is time, the 
Triton s, haVing improved, 
took two matches from thi s 
tough team ; the final score 
coming out 7-2 In favor of 
SDSU 

Bill Duke overcame his 
opponent with relative ease 
in the first singles, &-4, &-2. 
Bil l's stron g driving and 
pass in g shots we re h is 
greatest advantage. Playing 
second singles, Kurt Fristrup 
started well but lost 6-4, 7-5 
to a stronger player. Un-
fortunately , Jack Tawf ik 
was not p laying his usual 
strong game, as his com-
petitor took the match 6-0, 
&-1 . 

SDSU; every match score 
was noticably closer than 
before. But, at the same 
time, it is the strong opinion 
of the entire team that if 
they had been allowed to 
practice every day on the 
uni versity court s th ey 
wou ld have won thiS match 
The lack of court privilege 
IS their only weakness. 

April 25, 26, 27, and 28 in 
Oj a i, Ca l ifornia, four 
m mbers of the UCSD m ns 
te nni s squad will , be 
competing in the worlds 
largest tennis tournament -
the Ojai Invitational 

Bill Duke, Kurt Fristrup, 
Angel Lopez and Jack 
Tawfik will be among the 
one thou sand players 
entered Duke and Fist rup 
will be entered in the men's 
i ndep end ent colleg e 
division Singles and Lopez 
and Tawfik will play In the 
doubles of th e sam e 
division 

The last th ree singles 
were all close matches 
which could have gone 
either way. Angel Lopez, in 
the fourth spot, gave his 
opponent a fight at 4-6, 6-2, 
7-5. Skip Schink also played 
a close match. H is fi nal 
score, hinging on a crucia l 
match point, final ized at 5-
7, 7-6, 6-4, favori ng hiS 
opponent. Shack Fisher did 
not take advantage of his 
opponent's weaknesses In 
hiS games, costing him 
pain!> in hiS 7-5, 6-] loss.

1M Attitudes Challenged 

III UNTITLED III 
by Mark lisb 

" Hey man, I'm just out to 
have a good time. I don't 
'eall y care if we win or not ." 

Sometimes , ju s t 
;om etlmes, you gott a 
Nonder . The intramural -
)rogram is established for 
) eople to have a good time 

right? We all know th e 
ntramural department is 
ow key and out to do their 
Jart The last time I was in 
the offi ce - the last three 
times - they were in there 
sittin g arou nd p l aying 
games (I couldn 't even 
figure out the game) and 
talking and yawn ing. OK, 
the problem isn't in the 
Intramural Department. 

But you're confu ed 
right? You want to know 
what I'm talking about? It 
all boils down to your 
definition of fun. The stated 
pu rpose of the program is 
for the participants to have 
a good time, get a li t t le 
exercise, get their head out 
of the books and be people 
and meet some new faces. 
Walking around and gazing 
upon some of the games. in 
progr ss are another tory 
entirely. The same dude 
telling you on the sideline 

that he wa nts to have fun, is 
the same guy that nearly 
castrate the poor girl trying 
to make a ca ll in a baseba ll 
game that even the great 
man himself, Bob Moss, 
couldn' t have made better 
with a magn ifying glass. 

No example is more 
relevant than watching an 
inn rtube water polo game 
That sport has to be one of 
the most exciting and 
enjoyable in the entire 1M 
program (if you don' t 
believe me, ask some of the 
parti cipants) The players 
all have a good time and 
the handicap of a tube and 
the water makes everyone 
nearly equal. I t never fail s, 
though a coup le of times a 
year it happens. There's 
always some stud that 
pl ayed four years of water 
polo in high school, was on 
the football team, ate raw 
meat and lifted weight s i n 
his spare time. 50 anyway 
there's a girl out there who's 
never played before in her 
life (she may have been 
picked up out of the sauna 
or somewhere and didn' t 
have anything better to do 
and couldn't turn down th e 
poignant pleading of a 
short-handed captain) who 

Trike Race Rules

ow that you havp the 
ru les go out and have a 
good ra or just enjoy It for 
what It IS if you de5 1f(~ only 
to watch these exciting 
races 

can't swim mo re than a 100 
yards without dying. She 
get's the ba ll and doesn' t 
know what to do with It. SO 
here comes Stan Stud out to 
have a good tim e, 
remember, and starts tak ing 
th e ball , a rm , head , 
whatever , away from hiS 
fierce opponent Now you 
may think that' fun, th 
fans may think it 's fun and 
we all know that Stan 

Studly thinks it's fun - but 
you really have to think 
twice to t hink if t he girl 's 
having a good time . 

What I'm really trying to 
say is think twice the next 
t ime you want to start 
yelling. Why not be like 
some of those oth er teams 
out there, bring a little b er, 
have a good time and take a 
10 s In stride.

off campUS, No other cases 
of attempted suicide have 
been reported to the police. 
A Revelle student died on 
campus of natural causes 
earlier this year . 

" Rumor s are very 
common," stated Lt . 
Huffman in reference to 
rapes on campus; however 
no actual rapes have been 
reported this year . Three 
women reported being 
" molested", he said, "but 
there were e )(tenuating 
ci rcum stances," and no 
rape was committed . He 
added that very often at-
tempted rapes and suic ides 
go unreported. 

"W e are not aware of any 
type of drug problem on 
campus. We know that 
mari juana is very prevalent 
on campus, but not hard 
dru gs," stated Lt. Huffman. 
He said that almost no 
complaints have reached 
the police recently and that 
a " get tough" po licy by 
M ui r Resident Dean, Cleo 
Malone, has not produced 
an increase In drug related 
arrests th is year . Huffman 
added that the Resident 
Deans often " act as a 
buffer" between tudents 
and the pol ice as they are 
not compelled to take 
ac tion against fir t time 
drug offenders and the

"We're not going out of 
the way to look for drug 
'offenders but we will take 
action if we are confronted" 
by illegal drug use," said 
Huffman . "Th is is no 
sanctuary ." Fifty pounds of 
marijuana was confiscated 
at Christmas by the police 
and one student liv ing on 
campus was caught " with a 
ver i table garden" of 
marijuana plants. Huffman 
said that students who have 
m issed " plants" from their 
ba lconi es recent ly m ay 
have had t hem " con-
fiscated" by their resident 
deans. 

Bicycle thefts are Jown 
th is year, according to 
M iller. A ring of bike 
th ieves wa s identi f i ed 
earl ier in the year and 
though evidence was not 
strong enough to bu ild a 
case, the t hefts stopped 
after police warn ed the 
suspects that their act ivi t ies 
were being watched 

Crimes reported during 
March 1974 included two 
bike thefts, two mali cious 
mischief complaints, eight 
car prowl s (va ndalism such 
as stolen hubcaps or broken 
windows), two burg laries, 
21 petty theft and 14 grand 
thefts 

Du r ing 
several 

Spring 
stereos 

b reak 
were 

reported stolen from t he 
dorms. Most complai nts 
came from students livi ng 
at Revelle during March . 
Th ird College had the fewest 
crimes reported. 

Officer M iller and Lt . 
Huffman offe red so me 
suggest ions to students for 
prevent ing crimes ; mark 
your property, and keep a 
list · of serial aumbers; lock 
vehic les and rooms, even at 
night, and report all persons 
ac t ing suspiciously to the 
pol ice. 

Debat4! 

" Should We [Sub-
stantially ] Inv4!st Our 
Energy Future In Nuclear 
Power?" is the topic of a 
formal debate to take 
place Monday, May 6 at 
8 :00 P.M . in the 
Humanilies Library 
Audilorium, University of 
California al San Diego, 

Despite the energy 
crunch , many Americans 
are extremely concerned 
about unresolved matlers 
perlaining to nuclear 
power and want to be 
assured we have nothing 
to worry aboul, stated 
PrOlram Chairman, Clay 
kemper of the San Diego 
Ecology Center. 

Lee Burke, " I spoke to 
Frank a little more than I 
did any of the other can-
didates lust because he 
wasn't on the phone " 

The Communication s 
Board posit ion was opened 
for the first time last quarter 
'when Comm . Board 
Chairman M ichael Weiss 
informed the Muir College 
Council of the vacancy 
Janet Beech who then held 
the position, could no 
longer handle it. 

Lee Burke said that 
Wendy Mackay was ap-
pointed by consensus vote 
at a Muir Commun ity 
meet ing in February. MCC
