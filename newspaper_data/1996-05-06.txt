BERKELEY, Calif. - Two 
former UC Berkeley students 
may have conned dozens of 
people out of nearly $300,000 
total over the last two years, 
according to an affidavit filed 
recently by UC police. Accord-
ing to the affidavit, the two 
former students asked various 
people - including UC 
students and staff - for loans 
under false pretenses. The 
Alameda County District 
Attorney's office is reviewing 
evidence against the two 
women, one a 27-year-old 
Berlceley resident and the other 
a 21 -year-old recent UCB 
graduate. No charges have yet 
been filed against either woman.

Leads to Antibody 
LOS ANGELES - Nine years 
ago, UCLA cancer researcher 
Dennis Slamon and his 
colleagues found an association 
between breast cancer and a 
gene called HER-21neu after 
studying tumors removed from 
cancer patients. Now scientists 
at Genentech Corp. recently 
developed an antibody, based 
on that gene, which attacks the 
protein structure of cancer cells 
and impairs the tumor's natural 
resi lance to chemotherapy. 
Slamon said he hopes the Food 
and Drug Admini tration will 
approve the antibody for 
widespread use in the next two 
or three years.

RALEIGH, N.C. - A state

that a lawsuit filed again t the 
Duke University Medical 
Center by the family of a 
woman who died at the center 
should go to trial. The family of 
Dora Epps McNair, who died in 
1990 after a cardiac

McNair's eyes, spinal cord and 
most of her internal organs were 
removed during the autopsy.

Healthcare 
Director Calls

Mark Patterson/Guardian 

DEPARTURE: Michael 
Stringer will develop special 
systemwide projects 
8yM..,a Pal 
Staff Writer 

After 12 years as the directorofhospitals and 
clinics at UCSD, Michael Stringer announced 
May I that he will leave his post immediately to 
become the assistant to Vice President for Clini-
cal Services Development William Gurtner in 
the UC Office of the Pre ident (UCOP). 

In his new role, Stringer will work with 
Gurtner in developing special projects for all 
five UC health-sciences campuse . 

In addition to UCSD, the UC system cur-
rently operates health-science campu es at UC 
Irvine, UCLA, UC Davis and UC San Fran-
ci co. 

"I am very proud of the hospital and health-
care sy tern that we have developed, and feel 
privileged to have worked with many talented 
individuals who have come together through 
UCSO's health-sciences enterprise," Stringer 
said. 

Stringer's decision to re ign his po t as the 
top admini trator of hospitals and clinics comes 
at a time when UCSD is seeking ways to reduce 
its annual operating budget, which currently 
stands at $350 million. UCSD has hired an 
outside consulting firm to report on possible 
cuts, ranging from $25 million to $30 million. 

In particular, the UCSD Medical Center is 
considering the possible layoff of 500-700 em-
ployees and the outsourcing of 200 additional 
jobs. 

According to UCSD Director of Health Sci-
ences Communications Le lie Franz, Stringer's 
new projects will include work on advancing 
community health by developing partnerships 
between the university and the private sector, 
securing funding for indigent care at UC hospi -
tals and creating purchasing opportunities on 
behalf of the University of Califomia. 

Laudable: Muir junior Ben Katz was honored Friday at the San Diego County Democratic 
Party's Jefferson-Jackson awards dinner. State Party Chair Art Torres and Democratic 
National Committee Chair Don Fowler delivered the keynote addresses. (See story be/ow). 

"Each one of our medical campuses is under-
going significant change to adapt to the continu-
ously evolving health-care industry," Gurtner 
said. "We are fortunate to have someone with 
Mike Stringer's background, experience and 
proven success in his field to assist us with some 
of the projects."

Muir College Student Named Young Democrat of the Year 
FUNDRAISER: UCSD 
junior Ben Katz praised 
for outreach efforts 
By Terry Lew 
AssociBfe News Editor 

Many people shy away from 
party politics, but not Muir junior 
Ben Katz. His yean of hard work 
and dedic:ation paid off Friday, when 
the· San CiciO County Democratic 
Party named him the 1996 Youna 
Democrat of the Year. 

Katz, along with several other 
prominent local Democrats, was 
honored at the party's 16th-annual 
Jefferson-Jackson Awards Dinner. 
California Democratic Committee 
Chair Art Torres and Democratic 
National Committee Chair Don 
Fowler spoke at the fundraising 
event, which took place at the his-
torie: Hotel del Coronado. 

Torres critie:ized Republicans for 
their "fcu, ~ and bi,ouy" and 
streacd the importanu of people 
like KIIIZ to the Democ:naic: Party. 

.. 

'The vision young Ben Katz has, 
and the vision those of us chrono-
logically gifted have ... it's that cross-
generational commitment to each 
other that's going to save us in the 
end,"Torres said. "We're a party of 
grass roots, and that's going to make 
a difference. We have people on our 
side." 

Katz currently serves as outreach 
director for the Young Democrats 
of San DielO County, and is the 
immediate put-president of the 
UCSDColleaeDemocnlS. KItz also 

served as the field director for Phyllis 
Kraus' unsuccessful attempt at the 
78th Assembly District seat. 

''To me, Ben Katz is impres-
sive," Kraus said. "He is bright and 
articulate, but not self-centered. He 
carries about and can express our 
democratic ideals, and he does so 
without Preachinl." 

Kraus added that Katz withdrew 
from UCSD durin, the winter quar-

International Conference Ad~ Notion of 'Public Space' 
DISCUSSION: Two-
day conference features 
round table forums 
8y AMnd ,Mel 
Staff Writer 

Representatives from Japan. Eu-
rope. Canada and the United Stales 
met May 3 and 4 at the Price Center 
for a conference entitled "Public 
Space and Democracy: Theatrical-
ity. Legitimacy. Politics." The con-
ference wasjointly hosted by UCSD 
and the ColiCge International de 
Philosophie. Paris. 

According to Conference Co-or-
ganizer and UCSD Political Sci-
ence Professor Tracy Strong. the 
goal of the conference was to "in-
vestigate what has happened to our 
understanding of the public. the 
space in which political events hap-
pen and where people encounter 
each other and work out their lives. 
and to discuss what has happened to 
democratic processes. or the space 
of democracy. in a nature of mass 
media." 

Conference Co-organizer Marcel 

G lA'S 

H~naff. who is both a member of the 
ColI~ge International de 
Philosophie. Paris and a UCSD 
French literature professor. said the 
conference also presented an oppor-
tunity to discuss the manner in which 
consumerism. materialism and the 
improvement in communication 
technologies have led to a lack of 
face-to-face discussions about com-
mon problems. 

"The loss of the public space. as 
a physical meaning. is that we do 
not useourbodies anymore." H~naff 
said. 'The risk is to become like 
ghosts or a community of absent 
bodies." 

The two-day conference included 
more than 15 hours of discussion. 
On both days. four or five academ-
ics introduced the day's topics with 
essay presentations. A panel of ex-
perts then led the audience in a fo-
rum discussion. 

On the first day. participants dis-
cussed the abstract concepts of 
power. theatricality and visibility in 
politics . 

Speakers included Universit~ du

Jacqueline Lichtenstein and Shigeld

tute for Research in Humanities in 
Kyoto, Japan. 

Among the presenters were 
Marcel Detienne. a classical-stud-
ies professor at John Hopkins and 
Paris Universities. who has authored 
over20 books. Albert Liu discussed 
public space and polilical autonomy 
in early Greek cities and then re-
lated these concepts to societies in 

792-7521 

Ethiopia and 18th-century France. 
Another presenter. UC Santa 

Cruz political science Professor J. 
Peter Euben. gave a humorous pre-
sentation about democratic account-
ability and comedic encounters. 
Euben questioned the influence of 
television on viewers and cited is-
sue-loaded programs such as 
"Roseanne." 

Themes highlighted on the sec-
ond day of the conference included 
democracy. the media and public 
space. 

Sylviane Agacinski. a philoso-
phy professor and French politician. 
presented an essay on the stages of 
democracy, particularly centered on 
French society. Agacinski added an 
international flavor to the discus-
sion by arguing lhat the concept of 
public space has different meanings 
all over the world. Agacinski theo-
rized t~at the media are dangerous 
to the existence of democracy but 
that society cannot live without 
them. 

University of Pennsylvania Po-
litica l Science Professor Anne 
Norton brought the di scussion back 

to the contemporary arena with her 
essay on the war against graffiti. 
Norton argued that graffiti should 
not be considered a crime because 
"it is a representation of democracy. 
whether good or bad." 

N9rton also criticized a society 
which corporate institutions such as 
Hooters restaurants are allowed to 
make implicit political comments 
about women. 

Other speakers included Amherst 
College Political Science Professor 
Dana Villa and Samuel Weber. a 
professor of critical theory at UCLA. 

At the conclusion of the con-
ference. discussion leaders tied to-
gether all the issues of the confer-
ence with a dialogue about the 
meanings of public sphere and 
public space. theatricality in the 
political arena and the 
politicization of the media. 

Henaff and Strong expressed sat-
isfaction with the overall results of 
the conference. while emphasizing 
the relevance of the conference to 
campus issues.

FINANCIAL AID 

UC Administrators Propose 
A New Plan 

To Meet Student Financial Need 
The Education Finance Model 
Represents Sensible Change 

As is par for the course, the UCSD Associated 
Students Council has once again taken an ignorant 
position on an issue of major importance. The couneil 
has highlighted its penchant for knee-jerk reactions 
and its tendency to lose sight of what is truly impor-
tant. in particular, I'm talking about a recent A.S. res-
olution which opposes a newly proposed plan for 

up all the needs for each school. The percentage of 
total need for each school is figured by dividing the 
individual campus' need by the aggregate UC need. 
This percentage is then applied to the total amount of 
financial-aid money assigned to the UC system to 
determ.ine the amount of money given to each campus. 

Formulas and figures aside, this system has two

flaws. By using the number of Pell 
Grant recipients to approximate Ihe 
need of a campus, students from mid-
dle-income fami lies are underrepresent-
ed. UC campuses with a large number 
of Pell Grant reci pients bUI a small pool 
of middle-income students now gel a 
greater share of financial-aid monies at 
the expense of schools with large mid-
dle-income populalions. 

(EFM). 
By failing to support the EFM, 

the ASUCSD refused to take the 
best interests of its constituents, 
the rudents of UCSD, into con-
sideration. 

The new model is an improve-
ment over the current system, not 
only in its relatively straightfor-
ward nature, bUI also in the way it 
allocates money in a manner 
more reflective of the needs of 
each UC campus. 

First, let 's examine how the 
current system distributes finan-
cial aid among the UC campuses. 

The number of Pell Grant 
recipients at each school is multi-

system, not only In 
Its relatively 
straightforward 
nature, but also In

UCcam~ •• 

The EFM would solve this inequity 
by laking into account lotal grant need, 
including both the federal Pell Grants 
and UC Grants, and multiplying that 
sum by the number of needy students to 
determine tOlal campus need. Thi cal-
culation would account for students 
whose parents make too much money 
to qualify for a Pell Grant but who still 
need financial assistance. Roughly one-

plied by the maximum amount of the Pell Grant 
($2,000) minus the average Expected Family 
Contribution (EFC) for Pell Grant recipients (the EFC 
is determined by a federal formula). This number rep-
resents the total need of each campus. The total need 
of the whole UC system is then calculated by adding 

quarter of UCSD's student popuLation falls into this 
category - a significant group of students whose 
needs are not accounted for under the current system. 
Another virtue of this new proposal is that it accounts 
for future enrollment changes because the calculation

The New Proposal Makes Unreasonable Demands of Students 
Higher student fees will be the primary 

product of I new syltemwide financial-aid 
poIi<:y proposed by UCSD Vice Chancellor 
JOIOph WIIIOn. The modcI - once called Chc 
Afrordability Model - was rcccntIy dubbed 
the Educalional Finance Model (BPM), and, 
as A.S. VICe President IntcmaI Greg.FIeId put 
jt, "t'llimply not affordable." 

The University of Californil Office of !he 
Preaidcnt's (UCOP) new model will raise stu-
dcnc fees and devote • IIIJeI' percaage of 
diem to financial aid. While the anent aid 
policy hu proYell insufficient, J»Iindly raisi III 
foes to JCIICI"IIC more money for financial aid 
is I troublesome propoIition. This plan will do 
nochina to close the ellillin, glP between 
acmaIlIUIIem need and aid Iwllded; it will 

only widen it. We should fulfill our mission IS 
I public university and provide an affordable 
cducalion to Ihoae who are qualified. We 
IhouJd be Iryina to move toward lower stu-
dent foea or, if pouible, eliminate fees and aid 
aItogecher. 

The uniwnity is primarily funded by fed-
eral, stale Ind c:ommunity sources, in IIddition 
to student fees. The CUITeI1t systemwide finan-
cial-aid policy assips roughly one-third of 
the money FlICIIICd from student fees to 
financial aid. UCOP then diSlributes I portion 
of thai money to eICh UC campus. But as fees 
have Ikyrocbted in Chc lISt decade, more stu-
dents have become eligible for financial aid. 
AIIhouih higher fees have increased money 
lYai1ab1e for filllllcial-aid outlays, the gains in 

aid have failed to meet the growing needs of 
IlUdcnts. 

The increasilll number of students eligible 
to m:cive aid has stretched financial-aid dol-
Ian to the limit Many students hive suffered 
cuts to their individual aid packages. In the 
last several years, the loIn-to-grant ratio has 
Hip-flopped. Previously, for every three grants 
lwarded, one loan was IWuded. Currently, 
three loins are lwarded for every grant 

In this lWbulent environment, UCOP put 
together I financial aid model that shows 
absolutely no foresight IlId has severe flaws. 
The office usumes that SlUdent enrollment 
and admiuions will remain COIIIIIant into the 
nellt century. However, UCOP's own CIVOll-
mmt-p1anning reports predict a huge growth 

in the number of new students eligible for UC 
admission by the year 2000, aptly named 
Tidal Wive n. The system is expecting a surge 
of new students, but it is not pn:paring enough 
financial aid for them. 

UCOP's plan for implemeding the policy 
also assumes that the federal government will

CHANG TwISTS FACULTY VIEWS ON CHINA 
Editor: 

After reading Peter Chang's ani-
cle ("Mao's Legacy Continues to 
Haunt China," April 25, 1996), I 
find mysclf in a very uncomfortable 
po ition. While [ agree with most of 
hi idea about Ihe human-rights 
violations commiued by the 
Chinese government, I take great 
exception to his attacks on the vari-
ous UCSD departments thaI cover 
modem China and its history. I find 
his piece to be full of half-truths and 
misguided interpretations. 

However, in the interest of brevi-
ty, I will restrict my comments 10 
only one of Mr. Chang's quotations: 
"Wi thout a doubt, one of the most 
revolting experiences in college has 
been to see the so-called Cultural 
Revolution - and its leader, Mao 
- worshipped and venerated by 
dim-bulb, college-aged nitwits and 
their equally stupid Marxists profes-
sors." 

As an East Asian History major, 
with a minor in Chinese studies, ] 
ask myself, "What class was he tak-
ing?" J have taken almost every 
class that UCSD offers to under-
graduates interested in China, and I 
have never seen Mao held up as a 
hero. Whi Ie it is true that at one ti me 
Mao enjoyed a popular following 
that some have called ''The Cult of 
Mao," this adulation came from pro-
paganda-duped Chinese peasants -
not Westerners. 

Mao's Cinderella-like rise to 
popularity from humble peasant 
root is still admired by some 
Chinese today. However, as my 
"stupid Marxist professors" have 
pointed out, even those who offer 
him grudging respect can't forget 
that Mao also committed heinous 
crimes against the very peasants 
who brought him into power. In my 
classes, the Cultural Revolution, 
the Great Leap Forward and other 
tragic events in Chinese history 
have been presented objectively as 
misguided policies of Mao that 
went terribly wrong, causing the 
deaths of millions of innocent peo-
ple and establishing Mao as a pop-
ular hero turned psychotic ego ma-

niac. 
I have never found any of my 

professors to be "stupid" or 
"Marxist." To understand the early 
Communist policies, it is necessary 
to have a basic understanding of 
Marxism. However, jusl because one 
studies a system of government 
doesn' t mean that one condones its 
doctrines. Mr. Chang seems to think 
that the entire faculty at UCSD is 
pro-Mao and pro-Chinese govem-
ment. How ridiculous! Many faculty 
members are married to Chine e 
nationals, and have friends and rela-
lives who are still suffering under the 
present oppressive regime. A recent 
guest lecturer that I had was in 
Tiananmen Square the day of the iIl-
fated student protest. Why would he 
be pro-Mao') [f anything, studying 
China's history makes one pro-
Chinese people. 

The average citizen in China has 
suffered more than most American 
can imagine, and to learn about wthe 
people's trials is to sympathize with 
their endured misery and to admire 
them for their courage in the face of 
unbelievable hardship. 

I am not an expert on China. I am 
not even one of the best students in 
my department. However, I am very 
interested in China and its people. 
While I agree with Mr. Chang's 
assertion that change is needed in 
China, 1 am concerned that my fel · 
low students might take his irrespon-
sible attacks on the UCSD faculty as 
truth. Chang's attempt to rally stu-
dents against their own school, tak-
ing advantage of their relative igno-
rance concerning China, is a propa-
ganda technique that would make 
Mao proud. 

I think a more enlightened article, 
concentrating more on the real abus-
es of the Chinese government and 
less on the imagined shortcomings of 
UCSO's ethnic-studies programs, 
would be more appropriate. But then 
again, what do ) know? Maybe I'm 
just one of those "dim-bulb, college-
aged nitwits" that Mr. Chang sees 
whenever he opens his hate-clouded 
eyes.

Article MIsstate. 
U.S. Policy 
Editor: 

Naomi Falk's commentary, "The 
U.S. Should Stay Out of China's 
Affairs" (May 2, 1996), was so off-
base that I couldn't help but respond. 
To compare the national policies of 
China to individual acts by police 
officers is the most preposterous 
thing I have ever heard , While I con-
demn and deplore the brutali ty of the 
Ri verside police, I would hesitale to 
say that it is a matter of U.S. domes-
tic policy. 

It is obvious that there does exist, 
on our police forees, a racist ele-
ment. And, obviously, we should do 
our utmost to eradicate it. 

However, Chinese human-rights 
violations are national, party poli-
cies. That is, someone high up in the 
government says, "Arrest that per-
son," or "Roll tanks into Tiannamen 
square." These acts are part of a long 
tradition of Chinese regimes 
oppressing their citizens. This tradi-
tion is not even necessarily confined 
to the communists. As can be seen 
throughout history, it is simply a fact 
among Chinese regimes. 

Th~ Guardian is now accepting applications for editor In chief, 
- Send cover letter, resume and clips by May 17 to: 
;"-

To say that the United States 
should stay out of Chinese affairs 
may be correct, but not for the rea-
sons that Falk states. The United 
States got involved in the Gulf War 
10 prolect its oil rights, and a a 
result, the people of Kuwail were 
liberated from an occupying force. I 
don't think the Kuwaitis cared what 
the Uniled States' reasoning was. 
Likewise, the people in China are 
being oppressed, and if pressure 
makes the regime change, I doubt 
whether the Chinese people will 
really care if the Uniled States' rea-
sons for intervening were economi-
cally or politically motivated.

Rally Opponent. Had 
No Place at Rally 
Editor: 

As one of Ihe organizers and par-
ticipants in the March 12 rally for 
affinnative action and social justice 
- an event which so many had put 
their time and effort organizing"- I 
was shocked to read uch a short-
sighted and degenerate assessmenl 
of the rally. [n response to the leller 
written by the opponent of the rally, 
("Affirmative Action Rally Not 

Ope~ to All," April 29,1996), ] offer 
some insight in hopes of shedding 
some light on their narrow-minded 
criticisms. 

Yes, the rally was in support of 
affirmative action. Much informa-
tion concerning the obstacles pre-
sented to people of color and women 
was disseminated. Considering the 
nature of the rally, the criticism that 
opponents of the rally were nOI 
allowed to speak is quite humorous. 
Their criticism is commensurate to 
President Clinton scolding the 
Republican Pany for not aI/owing 
him to speak at its national conven-
tion. Is it justified to ask those who 
put tremendous amounts of time and 
energy into the rally to allow oppo-
nents to speak, when they offered no 
insight or help into its production? 

Second, if opponents of affirma-
tive action are so vehemently 
opposed to Ihe rally, why don't they 

111111111 

liE 

BBl. 

stage their own rally against it? If 
"nearly half of the UC faculty" and 
a significanl portion of the student 
body are opposed to affirmative 
action, [ am sure that they will have 
no difficulties in securing the assis-
tance needed 10 slage such an event . 
However, such a suggestion would 
be ludicrous. Who would suggest 
such an idea as having student 
organize in support of is ues they 
strongly believe in? 

Third, weeks prior to the March 
12 rally, a debate concerning the so-
called California Civil Righls 
lnitiative was sponsored with oppo-
nents and advocates of the initiative. 
This would have been an ideal 
opportunity for Ihe opponents of 
affirmative action to have voiced 
their opinions, considering that pro-
moting education seems to be a high 
priority for the critics. 

Fourth, in responsc to cri ticism 
that opponents of the rally were 
excluded, it must be noted that your 
letter lead to the argument's demise. 
Because the "high-profile, pro-affir-
mative-action rally which received 
considerable media attention" was 
also highly publicized, I find it com-
icalthat rally opponents approached 
organizers at the last minute after an 
agenda, speakers Ust and schedule 
had already been finalii:ed. 

Finally, as a UC student, I find 
the suggestion to "reconsider fund-
ing of the groups which sponsored 
the March 12 rally" quite commend-
able. All of the student organizations 
which sponsored the rally should 
have their funding increased, due 10 
their dedication to issues that are 
pertinenl to the sludent community. 
As a tax-paying student, [ applaud 
the use of my student fees that went 
toward the funding of the March 12 
rally for social juslice. f applaud the 
many students who sacrificed so 
much in the name of social justice 
and affirmati ve action, and in partic-
ular I applaud those who were 
arrested that day. To aU of you, Mil 
Gra\.:ias!

The second major failing or the

ICCOWII for differences in the 00Il of

ddennining need. Uving 00Ils at 
schools like UC Irvine, where many

The BFM would change this by

and the Direct Lending program.

Committees of both houses of 
Congress cur SSIG, the program 
that funds CII Grants, from $62 mil-
lion to $31 million. That level of 
funding for an entire nllion of col-
lege studenls is wholly insufficient, 
and the EPM does not account for 
this impending loss of funds. 

UCOP llso fails to account for 
changes in the socioeconomic com-
position of the student population. 
In light of the regents' recent deci-
sion to eliminate race and gender 
criteril in the admissions process 

including III 1YCr8F off-campus 
Iivilll cost in the dctenninIIion of 
total need. This would add a me. 
sure of equity to the distribution of 
financill aid and give students I 
grcalCr opportunity to decide which 
school to IlteIId bucd on the indi-
vidual Campllacs' merits, I'IIhcr than 
which school is cloICIt to home or 
has the lowest rental I'ItCI in its 
immcdillC area. For eumpIc, &ood 
schools like UCSO arc now ignored 
by Iow-incomc IIUdcnIs bocIuse of 
the cXpcnIC or livins in La JoUa. 

The l'CIOIution in which the A.S. 
opposes the EfM IIaIes, " ... the c0n-
cept of assisting more low-and mid-
dle-income students to IUcnd UC 
schools is favorable to this 
Association of students." Why, 
then, would the A.S. come out 
against a pllll which would more 
equitably represent the need of 

and wcigh the socioeconomic factor 
more heavily, we CIII expect to see 
III increase in the number of low-
income students attending the UC 
system. Obviously, a rise in the 
number of low-income students wi II 
increlse the demand for financial 
aid. However, the EFM fails to 
account for this increase in demand, 
as well as for potential increases in 
the inflation rate. 

The ffilM also malces some ludi-
crous demands of students, such as 

~iring that all dependent students 
live at home during the summers 
they are in college. This require-
ment will limit students' ability to 
participate in valuable activities 
such as attending summer school or 
talcing an internship. Also, the 
model requires dependent students 
living off campus to sign a nine-

Our reprcacntaliVCl have to 
remember who their constituency is: 
UCSO studcIU. The numben of the 
new plan speak for Ihcnudvca. By 
ICCOUIIIina for the financiaJ needs of 
middle-income families, UCSO's

into III incmue of more than S 15

work and loans IS too cxllemc. The 
model ISSUJIICI IhIl stuclcnts will be 
able to find jobs paying 56 an hour 
cbing the school year and over 
breaks_ But according to the A.S., 
assuming such I high wage is obvi-
ously unfair. However, most people 
with some college education and a 
little bit or motivation can find I job 
which pays thai wage or more. Even 
those starting below that wage 
would get promoted quickly if they 
showed Illy aplitudc in their jobs. 

Another of the objections made 
by the A.S. centers around the 
expectation that students wort fuD-
time over summer. I sec: nothing 
unreasonable about this assumption. 
If an cducalion is important to the 
student, woding through the sum-
mer break to help alleviate the debt 
incurred is not a huge sacrifice. As 
an added bonus, students II'C acquir-

week of Spring Brealc and the three 
weeks of winter vacation, and to 
wOOc 6-20 hours a week during the 
school year. These expectations 
severely limit a student's opportu-
nities It college, and basically pre-
vent him from going abroad or talc-
ing an internship. Considering that 
many students already work 5- I 5 
hours a week, increlsing their 
workload could lower academic 
achievement and extend the aver-
age length of attendance at the uni-
versity to five or six years. This 
will force students to borrow more 
money and further increase their 
loan debt. 

In addition, the new model does 
not account for differences between

The objections to the EFM miss

typical of the A.S., which apparent-
ly bclicves everything should be 
handed to them on I silver platter. 
The resolution against the EPM was

ual campuses each year, differences 
such as the cost of living will not be 
lIIcen into account. The model will 
force UCOP to ignore the fact that it 
costs more to live in La Jolla than it 
does in Riverside. Similarly, cam-
pus-specific fees such as RIMAC 
would be overlooked. 

The EduCitional Finance Model 
neglects many imponant factors and 
places overwhelming demands 
upon students. It is of the utmost 
importance that the UC system pre-
serve access and affordability.

chance will be lost.

STRINGER: 
Interim director 
to be appointed 
ContInued from pac. 1 

Since being appointed director 
of hospitals and clinics in 1984, 
Stringer has been credited with 
developing many of the UCSD 
Medical Center's specialty and 
critical-care programs, including 
the regional burncenter,the trauma 
center, a special-care center for 
infants and a comprehensive or-
gan-transplant program. He also 
played a crucial role in advancing 
regional services, including the 
Life Flight helicopter service and 
the Poison Information Center. 

"Although our system faces 
many challenges, I am confident 
thai UCSD will continue to fulfill 
its vital role in our community, 
based on its strong foundation of 
excellence and the high qualilY of 
its physicians. staff and programs," 
Stringer said. 

"I look forward to making a 
contribution to UCSO' s future as I 
tum my attention toward our UC 
academic health-care system," he 
added. 

Stringer has been lauded by 

""l.ad'd 
clO IItSD GuarrIIen 

9500 Gilman Dr. 0316 
La Jolla, CA 92093 

others in the health field for recog-
nizing the need for academic 
health-centers to expand clinical 
activity beyond the hospital set-
ting. He has also played a vital role 
in implementing the UCSD 
Healthcare Network - a 
countywide health-care system 
which serves to connect univer-
sfty- and community-based physi-
cians and hospitals. 

"One of the hallmarks of Mike's 
leadership during his many years 
at UCSO has been his deep com-
mitment to the health of the San 
Diego community," Interim Chan-
cellor Marjorie Caserio said. "[He 1 
has played a leading role in tran -
fonning the fonnerCounty Ho pi-
tal into the premier academic medi-
cal center that it is loday." 

Although Stringer will be work-
ing for UCOP in Oakland , his base 
of operalion will remain in San 
Diego. He will also retain the title 
of associate vice chancellor for 
health sciences al UCSD. 

According UCSD School of 
Medicine Dean Dr. John Alksne, 
an interim director will be ap-
pointed while the hospitals look 
for a new chief administrator to fi II 
the post left vacant in the walce of 
Stringcr's departure.

initely a great opportunity to help the less fortunate San

t h e 

A View From the ' 
Press Box During 

Last Tuesday's 
Padres' Game 

Against the Giants 
s a rule, sportswriters are failed athletes. You know the type -
the guy who thought he was a hot shot in high sctiool. The guy 
who played football and basketball. The guy who was so-so 
at sports but had no chance at playing beyond graduation. 

Then there were the guys like me. The guy who was 
always picked last when people were selecting teams for 
games of econd-grade kickball. The guy who viewed 
most sporting events from the bench. 

Back then, in my formative days, I didn' t care. If the game was softball 
or kickball or baseball, I would skip happily out to first basco 

"No, Sweeney, you're in right field." 
I always knew that my career as athlete would never amount to much, 

but that never tempered my love for sports. Somehow, someday, I would 
find a way to be a pan of it, no matter what. 
Take me out to the ballg&me 

So in ranking the high points in my life, serving as an official member 
of the press at last Tuesday's Padres ' -Giants' game would probably rate 
second on the list - right after birth. 

You see, 1 love baseball . In fact , "love" isn't a trong enough word to 
describe my infatuation with the greatest of American institutions, a game 
that for over a century has defined our country, as well as inspired its 
citizenry. I spend my every waking hour watching ESPN's "Baseball 
Tonight," pouring over box scores and perpetually reliving some of the 
greatest moments in baseball history, like DiMaggio's hiTLing streak and 
Mays' over-the-shoulder catch. And when I sleep, I have baseball dreams. 

Sitting in the press box during a baseball game is like living those 
dreams. You feel like you ' re pan ofthe action. The field unfolds in front of 
you, and the best part is you get to enjoy it purely, without the irritating 
incidents that are an inevitable part of sitting in the stands. Indeed, there's 
no sweaty, beer-bellied, bare-chested ape sitting behind you - why is it the 
fat guys are always the first ones 10 take off their shins? - bellowing 
approval in your ear every time Tony Gwynn gets a hit. 

[n the press box, each time Gwynn singles, the reporters don' t applaud 
or even look up. Applauding i laboo because it hows journalistic bias. 

See PADRES, Page 13

The press box at Jack Murphy 
Stadium is located on the first-base 
side above the Loge seating. The 
box has a nice elevated view of the 
lush emerald field and its carefully 
manicured. natural-grass diamond. 

On a table sits piles upon piles of 
freshly xeroxed stat sheets. 
containing enough obscure facts 
and mind-numbing figures to gorge 
even the most vociferous of stat-
demons. Infonnalion ranges from 
Brian Johnson's 1996 bauing 
average against left-handed 
pitchers. to the Padres' attendance 
figures for the young season. to the 
current roster of disabled players.

Every statistic a journalist could 
ever desire - plus a million more 
- are at his fingertips. 

Not surprisingly, the sheets were 
saturated with news concerning the 
Padres' incredible stan: Prior to 
game time. San Diego was 17-9-
on its way to possibly the best first 
month in franchise history - and 
was currently holding down first 
place in the National League West.

and highlights from other games

The big news among the 
reporters Tuesday was the 
resurgence of the Giants under the 
leadership of superstar Barry 
Bonds. There's a reason why Bonds 
isn't a sportswriter: The guy is too 
good of a player. Just ask the 
Padres, who - if they were picking 
their team today like those second 
graders - would eagerly select

have to face him. In 52 games 
against San Diego. he has had 19 
home runs to go with 46 RBI. 

"( jusl like it [in San Diego)." 
Bonds chuckled, after the game. 
"I've always liked playing here." 

So when Sir Bonds and his 
Giants came to town for last week's 
contest against the Padres. he was 
expected to draw blood from San

Tewksbury and his team. The hope 
was the Padres would only allow 
him to cause a mild flesh wound. 
Unfortunately for the home team. 
Bonds ended up stabbing major 
bodily organs. 

The score: Bonds 6. Padres 4. 
Behind Bonds' 6 RBI. via a 

grand slam and a two-run shot. the 
Giants coasted to a 9-4 victory. 

~ bIIIII 
Nothing is as American as the 

traditional singing of the "Star-
Spangled Banner," and once it had 
been sung rather poignantly by pop 
vocalist Carol Warren. Padres 
starter Bob Tewksbury hurled the 
first pitch at 7:07 pm. The 14,170 
cheering fans immediately 
understood why Manager Bruce 
Bochy's team has enjoyed its early 
season success: The Giants were 
quickly retired in order to start the 
first iMing.

first. 
"Watson didn't start off too 

well." Giants' manager Dusty 
Bater later said. 

Indeed. the game was hardly 
five-minutes old before leadoff man 
extraordinaire Rickey Henderson 
promptly laced a single to center. 
Already. the crowd was roaring. He 
moved to second on a passed ball. 
advanced to third on Gwynn's 
groundout and scored on a double 
smashed by Ken Caminiti. Wally 
Joyner then singled. scoring 
Caminiti. and just like that, the 
Padres led 2-0. 

After scoring another pair of 
runs in the second inning -
punctuated by a Henderson solo 
home run - the Padres held a 
comfortable, 4-0 edge. 

"I'm getting away from that rib 
cage muscle injury." Henderson 
said. after the game. "I'm opening 
up a little more."

PADRES: 
Reversal of fortune 
Continued from .,... 13 
80s faslballs were somehow 
baffling lhe Giants, who after four 
innings had managed only three 
hit! . Even Bonds looked bad, 
winging and popping up on cut 

fastballs. TIle Giants spent mosl of 
the first half of the game OUI in the 
field, rather than in the batler 's box. 

") know from my own past (as a 
player]," Baker later said, "you hate 
to just barely sit down in the dugout 
before you have to go out on the 
field again and play defense." 

In the press room, reponers and 
AP writers were already madly 
typing in game stories. II seemed 
inevitable that tomorrow's headlines 
would hail Tewksbury's mastery of 
the Giants. However, the game was 
far from over. The Padres still had to 
face a disaslel'O\lS fifth inning. 
The 1IftI"'fiillnl ..... 

. The great mistique about baseball 
is the way a lame can tum around. 
At any juncture - no rnaaer wll3l 
the score - a team can paste 
together a rally, score some quick 
runs and take die Jeed. Buebail isn'l 

limited by time constrainI.s. You 
how to keep Ihrowing strikes IDd 
notcbina the ow. As Jong as the 
opposing leam has an out 10 work 
with, they still have a chance. 

Tuesday's fifth inning was a 
prime example of how a team's 
fortunes can drastically reverse, 
without waming. 

"Il just seemed like we couldn't 
catch a break in the fifth," Bochy 
said, after the game. 

San Francisco marched II 
batters up 10 the plate during thal 
inning. Six of them ended up 
cros ing il. The 7-8-9 hillers all 
reached base to open up the inning 
- Sieve Decker and Rich Aurilia 
both singled, and Watson walked. 

The key at-bat was leadoff man 
Marvin Benard: He hit an easy 
grounder to second baseman Jody 
Reed that was clearly a double-play 
ball. Reed fielded it cleanly, but in 
trying to tag out Watson, he had the 
ball jarred from his glove. All 
runners were safe, and a run scored. 

Robby Thompson then knocked 
in Frisco's second run with a single. 
Score: 4-2. Situation: bases loaded, 
no OUIS, Bany Bonds at the plate. 
Up 10 this point, he had been hitless 
in two ai-bats.

PIdres. launching a 436-foot rocket

"Maybe Tony GWYM has a lot 
to do with it, being a great hiller and 
a great player," Bonds said. "When 
you have the opportunity to watch a 
good hiller every day, you get to see 
the thi ngs he does that are righl, and 
emulate [him) a little bit." 

Though there were still no outs, 
the Padres managed to escape the 
inning without allowing any more 
runs. However, the damage was 
done. Score: 6-2.

Plus, the long offensive inning 
allowed Watson and the defense to 
rest. Watson subsequently seemed 
10 find himself, limiting the Padres 
to nothing but goose eggs on the 
scoreboard.

''The most impressive thing is 
that after [Watson) got those runs, 
he shut them down the very next 
inning," Baker said. "A lot of times

"We got them out the next 
innina, wbic:h allowed us to pad the 
Iead." he said. 

The Giants "padded" the lead in 

the very next inning against 
Tewksbury, who surprisingly was 
left in the game. Bonds again was 
the culprit, this time roping a laser-
beam, two-run horner that sailed 
364 feet into the night. 

With that shot, Bonds set a 
major league record with II home 
runs in the month of April. 

"I feel strong every time ) get up 
there," Bonds said. "I don't have 
any weak moments."

PADRES: 
Beyond boxscores 
Continued from INC- 14 
The poet ....... interviews 

I was warned about a few simple 
rules prior to attending my first 
Major League Baseball game as a 
member of the press: Ariive on 
time, bring a tape recorder, acl 
professionally, and most of all, 
never, ever get caught staring at one 
of the players in the locker room -
especially while they're changing. 

Now, upon cursory analysis 
such a rule would appear to be 
ridiculously obvious. However, 
considering these guys are celebs 
that I don't see everyday, I had to be 
especially on guard: "Woah! Look 
over there - that's Tony Gwynn! 
And, hey! II's Rickey Henderson! 
In his jockstrap, no less!" Very 
unprofessional attitude. 

In other words, I had to pretend 
I had spent everyday in the locker 
room Wilh some of the greatest 
players of alltimc. 

And as I arrived al the Giants' 
clubhouse, I tried to adhere to thi s 
mindsel. A gaggle of reporters had 
already assembled outside, no doubt 
wailing for the players to be suitably 
clothed so as to conduct interviews. 

Arter a securily guard nodded, 
the press poured into Baker 's 
oflice, which lies just inside Ihe 
clubhouse entrance. About six to 
eight reporters were inside, 
jockying for position, straining to 
gel their tape recorders and mics 
close to receive that elu ive golden 
quote. It's the quote that - clearly 
and simply - can cast meaningful 
illumination on the game's events. 

When asked about Barry Bonds ' 
monster game, Baker attribuled it to 
preparation . 

"I think that goes to off-season 
conditioning, and how he trained," 
Baker said. "He got his aCltogether 
in spring training." 

Baker moved discussion away 
from Bonds and onlo Watson, who 
pilched a solid game after the inilial 
rough two innings. 

"He made some quality pilches 
which allowed our defense to work 
and make some timely double plays," 
Baker said. '!hal'S a pilcher's beSI 
friend when you need 10 get out of 
trouble - that double play." 

Of course, attention turned to the 
man of Ihe hour, Bonds, as he 
personably relayed his, feelings 
conceming his monsler game. For a 
guy with the reputation of being 
curt with the press, he seemed very 
accomodating. 

"I made some adjustments and 
changed a couple of things," Bonds 
said. "I went over some films to see 
what I was doing wrong." 

On the alarming rate of home 
runs being hit in baseball, Bonds 
attributed it to the powerful hitting 
more that weak pitching. 

"Guys are bigger and stronger," 
Bonds said . "J don't think there's 
anything wrong with pitching 
staffs. Guys are so strong now, 
when they hil it, it goes." 
SlklIne at home 

In the end, being a press member 
at a ball game is like having a 
backstage pass to a concert - il 
allows you to see beyond the 
statistics and learn a little bit aboul 
the players themselves. 

It also creates a deeper 
apprecialion for what real 
sportswriten do. Maybe they aren't 
reknowncd for on-field prowess, 
but their off-field work - namely, 
communiQlinl lune information 
- is a cumbenome !Uk involving 
a deep devotion 10 the craft.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Women's Lacrosse 

The Final Fourofthe Intereolle: 
giate Women's Lacrosse 
Association's Western Division is 

nothing new to Ihe club l from UCSD. The Tritons ha ve, after all, been there on three previous occasions. BUlthis time was di fferent be-
cause, among other things, "there" 
was here. 

UCSD was fortunate enough to 
host this year's meeting of the best in 
the West, which included a pair from 
the North (UC Davis and Berkeley) 
and a pair from the South (the host 
Tritons and Arizona). 

The competitioo began on Satur-
day, and UCSD's first obstacle came 
in the form of the women from Cal. A 
dead--c:VCII first half, knotted at three, 
was followed by a higher-scoring sec-
ond stanza in which Berkeley 
outscored the Tritons by three to take 

the~, 1()'7. AUI Maclsaac/GuM11ian 
The game was rough. as a number 

ofUCSDplayerscrxbedminorblows 
to the head from several caJ competi-
tors, one of whom was thrown out of 
the game for the foul. 

MovIn': Katie Galvin (left) sprints past an Arizona defender during 
the third-place game, which the Tritons won, 9-8. 

Marisa Bell paced the Triton of· 
fense in defeat, tallying three goals. 
Ii« outbnding offensive effort was 
complemented by a pair of goals from 
Shannon Northrup and one each from 
Sian BciJock and en Burke. 

In the other semifinal, Davis 
soundly defeated the Wildcats from 
Arizona. 11-3, to earn a berth in the 
championship game against the 
Golden Bear squad. That left Arizona 
and UCSD to battle it out for Southern 
California supremacy in the third-
place game. The contest was a rematch 
of a Feb. 24 game at Arizona in which 
the Wildcats earned the ~ctory. 

This time, however, the Tritons 

garnered the win with a narrow 9-8 
triumph. The final moments of the 
game were tense for the UCSD back-
ers in attendance. as the Wildcals were 
in hot pursuit of the ball and the tying 
goal, while the Tritons were playing 
keep-away with their foes . The ploy 
worked, and the final seconds ticked 
off the clock with UCSD passing the 
ball around behind its own net. 

This game was also marked by 
some painful moments for the Tri-
tons, the most harmful of which was 
an injury to scoring threat Chris Moll, 
who went down lare in the first half, 
Moll was able to return to the side-
lines in the second half, but only with 
the aid of a pair of crutches. 

Her teammates, however, contin:

ued in her absence, clinging to the 
one-goal advantage (5-4) they had 
enjoyed at the half before their eva-
sive tactics ended the game at 9-8. The 
offensive punch on this occasion was 
provided by three, two-goal scorers: 
Cara Burke, Northrup and Bcilock. 
Amy Hasselfeld, Moll and Katie 
Galvin each pitched in with a goal . 

The victory marked the first time 
in their four trips to the Final Four 
that the Tritons were able to earn 
third-place, having settled for fourth 
the previous three times. The win 
also put the fini shing touches on the 
careers of a trio of UCSD players: 
Nonhrup, Sarabeth Horspool and 
Tina Manjoros.

MAGIC: Is the 
letter 'I' in team? 
ContIIIued frGnI ..... 24 
rolled around, he began the "I" cam-
paign. 

Suddenly, he started to say things 
Iikc: I want to win./mighl not play for 
the Laten next year,l am Ihc leader, 
and 1 am the only one playing well. 
While Johnson's mouth r.n off in 
public, his actions excmplified the 
Yay faults he was chastising. 

Johnson's hypocricy was evident 
when he expressed concerns to his 
teammates about togetherness and 
unity, but later told reporters he 
might not play for the Lakers next 
year. Another instance was when he 

admonished Van Exel for inexcus-
ably bumping a refcrcc, but five 
days later he was convicted of the 
same offense. 

And Ita last Friday, Magic ex-
pIaincd to Ihc rest of us iporant fools 
Ihc I1lOIICWy worth of his God-Iikc 
abilities. After contributing migtMily 
to the liters' losses, Johnson said he 
deserves the same IIIIOUIIt of money 
that ShaquiUe O'Neal and Michael 
Jordan will get next year - at least 
$1 S million. HtheLlkasdo not oblige 
his request. he wiD like his glorious 
self to another town. 

So much for togetherness. 
Here's the reality: First, Magic is 

too old to replace Van Exel as starting 
point guard - which is one of his 
requests. At 37, he is past his prime 

The UCSD Guardian 

and cannot play the solid 38 minutes 
required of this position. Second, his 
salary demands arc way 100 steep. 
Jordan and Shaq have the capability 
to dominate games; Magic does not. 

While Magic Johnson once typi-
fied the idcallcam player, with crisp 
passing and inspiralionalleadcrship, 
he has become a selfish man. 

His long layoff from basketball 
has only made him desire the spot-
light even more. Magic is an ego-
centric athlete who craves attention. 
And because he can't reproduce his 
former excellence on the floor, he 
detracts from his teammates' efforts 
as he tries to regain his former self. 

Somebody needs to remind him 
that a team is a group of people, not 
merely one man.

DEBACLE: cu 
sweeps doubleheader 
ContInued from pep 24 

Mary Jane 0110 (5-1 S) held the 
Panthers scoreless in the first in-
ning of the second game. but then 
she gave up two runs in each the 
second and third innings to put the 
game out of reach for the Tritons. 

0110 and her teammates 
couldn't stir up much of an of-
fense and made fi ve more errors in 
the field. 

Cancilla continued her torrid 
hilling for Chapman. The senior 
shortstop collecled two more hits 
and set a new NCAA record with a 
31-game hitting streak. Cancilla 
eclipsed her teammate Maiben's 
previous record of 30-straight 
games with a safe hil. 

Maiben started in the pitcher's 
circle for Chapman again in the 
second game. but was relieved in 
the fourth inning by fellow sopho-
more and - surprise. surprise-
All-American Christy Guidorizzi. 
Maiben and Guidorizzi teamed up 

to hold the Tritons to two 
hits in six innings. with 
Maiben picking up her sec-
ond win. boosting her sea-
son record to 11-3. 

"[GuidorizziJ has been 
offered a scholarship to go 
Division I next year." 
Gerckens said. "I'm pretty 
sure that she's going to 
jump." 

While the Tritons' sea-
son ended on a low note, 
they will have the luxury of 
returning all bUI one of their 
players next year. suffering 
only Ihe loss of senior third 
baseman Christine Mann to 
g{aduation.

lineup should return fot ac-

The UCSD Guardian 

USA: Olympic 
team visits UCSD 
Continued from .,... 24 
our team has an average jump 
reach of 10'3". It's exciting. The 
reason women's basketball is so 
boring is because it's played with 
men's dimensions." 

Clearly. Liskevych has a pas-
sion for the sport he coaches and 
the women who play it. and to 
hear him tell it, UCSD will most 
likely adopt that sentiment fol -
lowing Friday's fireworks in 
RIMAC. 

The matchup with China has a 
history which includes a Chinese 
victory over the U.S. in the gold-
medal contest at the 1984 Los 
Angeles games. It was following 
that performance that Liskevych 

assumed control of the team 
without a single returning player. 

"( didn't even have any scout-
ing reports," Liskevych explained. 

However. what Liskevych 
did have was a sound coactiing 
philosophy that has seen him 
successfully lead team USA 
through the 12 years since he 
took over. His record since be-
ing named head coach is 320-
266 - impressive. especially 
considering the intensity of com-
petition at the international level 
and his rather meager beginnings 
with the team. 

The philosophy which got 
him here is one-part cliche, two-
parts desire and one-hundred 
percent from the heart. 

"You have 10 mesh a team 
worried not about individual but 
learn glory .... I believe in people 

Monday. May O. J Y'IO 

that work hard and mold them-
selves to the leam .... The process 
is as important as the goal: The 
team enjoys playing and we are 
here to be the best we can be." 

They will have a chance to 
prove just that when July rolls 
around . But. for now. the women 
volley bailers ~ whose dynamic 
performances at the Olympics will 
undoubtedly be overshadowed by 
the feats of the USA men's basket-
ball Dream Team among others-
will be conteAt to hone their abun-
dant skills against China. 

So. if you have any desire to get 
a glimpse of the athletic ability 
which will be on display at this 
summer ' s grealest of sporting 
spectacles. join Team USA on Fri-
day night, and hold onto your hats. 
because their warming up for a 
shot at glory .

THE CYNIC PORTS SEANRAHIMI Magic Is No 
Hero of Mine 

Pardon the cliche, but the 
last time I checked my 
official sports Bible, there 
was no "I" in the word 
"leam." A team is a group of 
persons associated together in 
work or activity, this accord-
ing to the high priest of 
definitions, Mr. Webster. 

Panthers Sink Teeth Into Tritons 

But Magic Johnson of the 
Los Angeles Lakers abides by 
his own definition of the 
word, and he seems to have 
misspelled it. A self·pro-
claimed God on the basket-
ball court, Magic feels it his 
duty to blame others while 
ignoring his own detrimental 
play. 

Witness the 1996 NBA 
playoffs: Magic and the 
Lakers, who were picked by 
many to contend for the tille, 
lost to the defending-
champion Houston Rockets in 
four games. During the series, 
Magic was quoted as saying, 
"Give me the ball and get out 
my way." He constantly 
questioned decisions made by 
Laker Head Coach Del Harris 
and pointed a finger of blame 
at each of his teammates. 

Furthermore, after the 
first-round defeat, the Magic-
man suggested to his team-
mates that they hould go 
home and ask themselves: 
"Are you really for the team, 
or is that just something that 
comes out of your mouth?" 

ClAME OVER: The UCSD softballers ended their 
season by suffering a pair of sound defeats at the 
hands of the number one-ranked Chapman Panthers 

By Mike Stan.e 
Staff Writer 

Chapman University came to the 
Triton Softball Field with only two 
losses against Divi ion III teams this 

year. And when the 
weekend' festivities 
came to an end, the num-
ber-one ranked Panthers 
still had only two losses. 

Chapman's quest for 
a second-consecuti ve 
NCAA championship 
co ntinu ed in full 

strength, after it pounded the La 10lla 
squad in both halves of Saturday's 
doubleheader. The Panthers roared to 
a 17-1 win in the opener before blank-
ing UCSD's overmatched squad, 10-
0, in the secon.d game, pushing their 
record to 36-7. 

"They are great athletes," Triton 
Head Coach Patricia Gerckens said of 
the Chapman players. "They were on 
a di fferent level. They were so good 
that they made us make mistakes." 

Chapman jumped out to an early 3-
o advantage in the first frame of the 
day, but the Tritons fought back to 
shave the margin to 3- I. Sophomore 
outfielder Jessica Plancich doubled 
and scored in the home half of the first 
inning to give UCSO hope. 

game." 
Unfortunately for the Tritons, this 

was the only run they would score all 
day . Panther pitcher Jessamine 
Maiben, one of four returning AII~ 
Americans,limited the Tritons to three 
hits over the five-innings contest, 
which was called, mercifully, with 
Chapman ahead by sixteen runs. 

Chapman's offense provided the 
kind of punch it would need to be a 
strong contender for the 'NCAA crown 
again this year, as it belted out 16 hits 
against Triton pitcher Sarah Bums. 

The Triton defense didn ' t give 
Burns much support, commi tting six 
errors in the field that led to more than 
half of the Panther runs. 

"There were times when we lost 
our focus," Gerckens said. "When the 
score gets to be so one-sided, frustra-
tion can lead to a lot of mistakes. We 
just didn't make the routine plays." 

While UCSD struggled, Chapman 
thri ved. With the talents of Ali-Ameri-
can enior Lisa Cancilla, the outstand-
ing Panther defense shut down any-
and-all Triton threats. Cancilla made 
some outstanding plays at shortstop, 
spearheading a flawless defense in 
the game. Cancilla also led the Pan-
thers at the plate with three hits, three 
RBI and three run scored. 

Maybe Magic should take 
some of his own advice. He is 
clearly the one who needs to 
stop mouthing off. And he is 
the one who needs to keep his 
overblown ego in check. I 
mean, let's face it: He's 
acting like a jackass. 

"At that point, the girls thought 
that they could hang with them," 
Gerckens said. "But that was the last 
time that they felt they were in the 

"[Cancilla] will probably be named 
player of the year in Division m," 
Gerckens said. "She is a great athelete."

USA and China to Drop Bombs in RIMAC 
In fact, it's almost difficult 

to tell which is worse: 
OLYMPIC PREVIEW: UCSD will host a pre-Olympic match between the USA and China on Friday 

Magic's horrible play in the 
last t~o games of the series 
- w~en he averaged 7.5 
points on 4-of-17 shooting -
or listening to the antagoniz-
ing and condescending 
garbage which spews from 
his overworked mouth. 

This attitude, however, has 
only reared its ugly head 

.. lately. When he began his 
comeback in January, he said 
all the right things. 

He talked of how he would 
adjust to the current Laker 
squad, and how he wanted to 
provide leadership to a young 
team. He didn't demand to 
play his old position of point 
guard, so as not to disrupt the 
development of current point 
phenom Nick Van Exe!.

For Head Coach Taras "Terry" 
Liskevych and the USA women's 
volleyball team, the upcoming At-
lanta Summer Olympics are more 
than just another chance to repre-
sent the country. They are a shot at 
international glory. 

Liskevych, who is in his 12th 
year as the head coach of the USA 
national squad, is the only coach 
to ever lead two United States' 
teams into the Olympics, doing so 
in the Seoul games of 1988 and the 
Barcelona Olympics of 1992. In 
Barcelona, the team took the 

, bronze, and Atlanta may hold still 
greater things for Liskevych and 
company. 

"Our chances are good, but it's 
going to be a crapshoot," 
Liskevych said in a rare break from 

his hectic schedule. "Cuba is the 
best team in the world right now, 
but Brazil and us are the only teams 
that have beaten 
Cuba in the past 
year."
