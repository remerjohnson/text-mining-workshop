From Fines 
BERKELEY, Calif. - The 
United States government last 
week decided that UC labs 
involved in nUclear-weapons 
research will not be subjected 
to stiff government fines for 
possible r.adiation-safety vio-
lations. Because the labs -
the Lawrence Livennore 
National Laboratory and the 
Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico 
- are federally funded . Even 
though fines will not be 
Icvied by the governmcnt, 
officia ls said non-profit-run 
labs. "'ill still be held to the 
same scrutiny as privatc labo-
ratories . Already, the U.S.

Student Orgs Show Off at FFOG 
FESTIVAL: More than 135 
groups entertain and educate 
UCSD community 
By Sara Snyder 
Guardian Reporter 

A line of tables spanned the entire length of 
Library Walk Friday, as 137 student organiza-
tions assembled for the 14th annual Fall 
Festival On the Green (FFOG). 

The Student Organizations and Leadership 
Opportunities office (SOLO) sponsored the 

event, which allows student organizations and 
clubs to recruit new members and distribute 
information about their organization. Several 
groups were allowed to sell refreshments, using 
FFOG as a chance to raise funds as well. 

"[FFOGJ is a great opportunity for all tu-
dents, not just freshmen," Yolanda Leyva, 
SOLO director, said. "[Students] can actually 
talk to the members of the organizations and 
see what the time commitment is like." 

The festival earned the "On the Green" por-
tion of its name from its original location on the

Cigarettes 
Stir Campus 
Controversy 
SMOKE: Protesters post 
Nicotine Anonymous signs 
outside General Store Co-op 
By Leena Shankar 
Associate News Editor 

Once again, students can buy cigarcttes on 
campus from the General Store Cooperative. 
The General Store has been selling cigarettes 
since the beginning of the school year. 

The co-op employees collectively agreed to 
sell American Spirit cigarettes, whieh are addi -
tive-free . Despite protests from students and 
staff members, the employees said they feel 
they chose to do the right thing by selling the 
cigarettes. 

"We had a lot of students asking for ciga-
rettes. We are here to give students what they 
want," said George Gonzales, a general Store 
employee. 

"We've had some complaints from people 
who disagree with selling cigarettes, but we 
have had much more positive feedback about 
selling them," he added. "Besides, you can't 
preach against tobacco but then sell alcohol on 
campus." 

In addition to expressing verbal disapproval, 
some people have been posting flyers advertis-
ing Nicotine Anonymous meetings on the 
store's windows. 

Angela Boyce, another co-op employee, 
said she feels that the posting is a good idea. 

"People have been covertly posting things out-
side about quitting smoking, but we are happy to 
post things for them," she said. "They've never 
posted anything before, so why only now?" 

The General Store closely follows the rules 
that come with selling cigarettes. 

"We card everyone," said Lisa Lewis, a co-
op employee. "And we only take California 
identification or passpons." 

Student Center Manager Matt Xavier acts as 
a landlord on behalf of the uni versity for the co-
ops on campus.

Our invisibility is 
Ihe essence of our oppression and 
until we eliminate that invisibility, 
people are going to be able to per-
peluate the lies and the myths about 
lesbian and gay people and in 
essence force us into a closet." 

Nguyen added that he believes 
people are scared of lesbian. gay, 
bisexual and transgender people 
because they don 't know them. 

"People fear the unknown," he 
said. " Jf they would take the time to 
gel 10 know a lesbian or gay per-
~()n, they would reali ze that she or 
he is just the same a~ they are." 

Many students gathered during 

UCSD Alumnus '" think it 's 
sad because you 

know there are a lot of people making 
fun of it," she said. "But , think it 's 
important for those who are lesbian, 
gay and bisexual to acknowledge it. .. 

Although National Coming Out 
Day was Friday, UCSD celebrated 
it one day early. 

Maze said thatlhe LGBA decid-
ed to hold Ihe activity on Thursday 
because they didn't want it to con-
nict with the Fall Festival on the 
Green (FFOG). 

"We want to have our own event 
special to UCSD," Maze said.

GENDER WAGE-GAP STATISTICS HAVE BEEN

crep:1ncy as the latc\! eVidence that we 
ncfarious males are up to our u\ual oppre\-
Slve ways. Howev.:r. a~ 1\ almo.,t alway, the 
case, the.e simpli"ic and (lverly gencral 
numbers tell onl y part of the story, and even 
that tiny hit uf inlorlnatiol1 1\ ohfu.cated 
under the feminazi party line. 

The lir.,t thing one must realize whcn 
looking at the numbers is that they compare 
people in different jobs, each of which 
require various education levels and time 
commitments. When making comparisons, 
one needs 10 compare like to like. If mca-
suring the effects of adult beverages on the 
body, it docs no good to compare the effects 
a Long Island Icc Tea produces to those aris-
ing from a Pabst Blue Ribbon Light simply 
beeau,t: both arc technica ll y akoholic 
drink.. . 

Is that because our systems arc discrimi-
nating against the Pabst because it is a crum-
my beer'! Of course not. The Long Island 
has a stronger effect because it contains 
Illore alcohol - thc two drinks are not 
the same, and will not produce the 
same re~ull. It is just as bad to com-
pare a male engincer with a mas-
ter's degree to a high-school 
educated female secretary. 
They simply are not the 
same, and will not be 
treated as if they were. 

I can already hear the 
comments spewing forth 
from the peanut gallery. 
"Oh yeah," say the femi-
nazis. "Shows how much 
you know. Even among the col-
lege-educated, and even in occupa-
tions where women outnumber men, 
the male income advantage is rising." 

Of course, they are right. Again, howev-
er, they misrepresent the case as male-
engendered discrimination and oppression. 
In fact, the gap among the well-educated 
arises from two mam causes. The first is that 

"collegc educated" I, ~till far too gencral a 
t:atcgory. The second is Irom tbe chOices 
madc by the women thelmelves

that on the average, men arc earnll1g up to )0

Jobs Recent ~tatis ti cs tell U!I that thi, wage

We all know that wage

how many of u, know 
as to what ex tent '! 

What I fo und to be 
the most shocking fact 
is that, on average, 
women with college 
degree earn the same 
amount as men with 

high school diplo-
mas. This is not 

just a minor gap in 
wages, it is a substan-

tial chasm. Evcry day we 
see men and women 
together in the same class-

es, talcing the same tests and 
earning the same grades, yet 

women do not receive th.e 
samc credit for their work 
in the real world . 

Despite a seemingly 
more level playing field in 

college, women still 
encounter brazen inequali -

ty when diving into the 
harsh realilies of the 

working world. 
When first 

entering the job 
force at a young 

age, women 
earn only a 
small fraction 
less than 
men, which 
see m s 

almost not 
w 0 r t h 
fighting 
for. A 
woman is 
not going 
to disrupt 
her life 

and career for a few hundred dollars a year. 
She will think .,he I~ not one of Ihe victims 
of the gross discrimination against women.

Women are believed to be worth le~ ~ In 
the work force for the simple reason thai 
they werc born female. This corporate-
induced preordained direction assigned to 
women on their career paths is a fact to 
which men and women alike do not pay 
much allention. 

Although women will go through 
everything a man has to go through to suc-
ceed, women are expected simply to stand 
by and to cash their paycheck every 
month. Reforms will not happen unless 
women stand up for what is rightfully 
theirs. 

For change to be effected, everyone 
needs to be a part of the so lution. We need to 
each actively seek to be informed and to 
support the cause. 

The discrepancy in wages has been part 
of our society for so long that almost every-
one in our country accepts it as fact. Few are 
willing to fight for a change, and those who 
are lack much-needed support. 

As the next generation of workers, 
today's college students must enter the work 
force , prepared to fight for equal wages, or 
accept the inequality their apathy will prop-
agate . 

According to the Civil Rights Act it is 
illegal for women to be paid less because of 
their gender, but there is nothing enforcing 
this forgotten section of the law. It is com-
mon practice for employers to ask employ-
ees to keep their salaries private, especially 
from other employees because of discrep-
ancies between men 's and women's 
salaries . 

Bills have been proposed to ban employ-
er's rules against discussing wages, yet none

COMMENTARY: Although the Promise Keepers' fundamental motives are well-intentioned, their philosophical principles 
and literal interpretations of the Bible are antiquated and inapplicable for America's post-1960s era 

PROMISE KEEPERS A STEP BEHIND THE TIMES 
By Ryan Olson 
Co-News Editor 

On Sat. , Oct. 4, ovcr 800,000 
men gathered at the Mall in 

Wa~hington . D.C. to partake of a 
"Sacn:d A~~emhly " before God. 
Joining the mcn were hundreds 
protesting the Promise Keepers 
motives. 

In the days leading up to the 
event in Washington , several news-
paper artide~ and tal~ ,how, dehat -
ed the Promise Keepers ' moltves 
and principle application~ , examin-
ing why several groups oppose 
their objectives. 

The Promise Keepe rs are a 
national evangelical Chri~tian 
men's group founded in 1990 by 
former University of Colorado 
football coach Bill McCartney. The 
group has held many conferences 
inside stadiums and sports arenas 
to bring men together for "worship, 
prayer and teachi ng." In 1996, the 
Promise Keepers held a conference 
inside San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. According to the Promise 
Keepers, more than 2 million men 
have attended the conferences. 

This is all fine, but the problem 
is that they appear so earnest. Their 
statemcnt of faith seems to be sin-

cere enough . However, problems 
develop once you delve beyond the 
shining statement s. 

The Promisc Kccpers' philo-
sophical principlcs are hased upon 
a Iitcral interpretation of the Bible. 
This could he the causc of many of 
the Promise Keepers' problems. 
Several leadcn, of the National 
Organinuion of Women (N .O.W.) 
havc said that thc Promise Keepe rs 
want men to control everything, 
indudlng womcn. 

All of their literature seems to 
urge men to " lead" their families . 
One often-used example is from 
Seven Promises of a Promise 
Keeper by Tony Evans. 

"If you' re going to lead, you 
mustlcad," says Evans in his book. 
"Be sensitive, listen. Treat the lady 
gently and lovingly, But lead." 

Does this sound familiar? 
Hearken back to the primitive days, 
before the -19605, when women 
were placed on a pedestal -
adored and admircd, but not 
allowed to do the same tasks that a 
man is "supposed" to do. 

Much of the material distrib-
uted by the Promise Keepers focus 
on the family and how the man is 
to be the center of that family. 

"If you're going to 
lead, you must lead. 
Be senaHlve, listen. 
Treat the lady gently 
and lovingly. But 
lead." 

- Tony EV.III 
Author and Promise Keeper 

Thcre seems to be no room for 
compromise on the issue. 
According to their material, the 
man has a specific role leading his 
family and community and the 
woman has a specific role in sup-
porting the male. 

h appears that several Promise 
Kccpers consider an active woman 

to be trouble. In a di scuss ion on 
ational Public Radio's Talk of the 

Nation. one of the leaders of the 
Promise Keeper~ acknowledged 
that one of the prophets in the 
Bible wa~ female . Howcver. he 
added that she wal, a prophet 
because "none of the llIen wanted 
to do II." 

Furthermore, the Prollli~e 
Keepers assembled at Mall did not 
ask forgivcne~, lor being scxi.t , 
although they "ere contrite for 
racism. 

In addition to being sex i~t, the 
Promise Keepers have abo taken a 
strict line against homosexuality. 
McCartney has rcferred to homo-
sexuality as "an abomination of 
Almighty God." 

This principle stems from their 
strict interpretation of the Bible, 
even though it is seriously out of 
tune with the times. The American 
Bishops of the Catholic Church 
issued a letter calling on families to 
love their homosexual children, 
However, gay men are weleome to 
join the Promise Keepers - to be 
converted, of course. 

II would have been hard for me 
to criticize a group that might cre-
ate some benefit for some families 

despite creating this massive con-
troversy. However, the group'~ 
veiled ambition for power should 
he of concern to everyone. 

Severa I leader, f rolll ot her 
Chmtian group, - ~uch a. Pat 
Rohertson of the Christian 
Coali tion - ha\(! financiall y 

a'l,i~tcd the Promise Keepers. In 
addition, the chief organi/er for the 
gathering at the Mall said that 
Promise Keepers would inevitably 
enter the poliltcal sphere: therein 
lies the problcm. 

If thc Promi,e Keepers start to 
"endorse" candidates, much like 
the Christian CoalitIOn does, where 
would it end? Several groups 
believe that the Promise Keepers 
arc pu hing for a theocracy - gov-
ernment ruled by the church. 

"We don ' t find ourselves in vio-
lation of the Constitution 101' the 
United Statesl:' McCartney said. 
"We've just got to make sure that 
the Constitution doesn ' t find itself 
in violation of God's law, God's 
written word." 

So much for the separation of 
church and state as enumerated by 
the Constitution of the United 
States. If they arc intent on cnsur-

However, aftcr talung a hard

numbers must be wrong, take it up 
with the Bureau of the Census. It 
collected them as part of its 1993 
data. 

However, that path is one mOSI 
women decline to take. Many 
women choose job with nexible 
hours requiring ski ll that do not 
become obsolete if they decide to 
take a few years off. In so doing, 
they free up more time that they 
can devote to their families . 

According to a recent 
KornlFerry study, only 14 percent 
of women aspire to the upper eche-
lons of the corporate world, com-
pared to 46 percent of their male 

be more inclined to ca ll for a 
change. 

While many activists in our 
count ry concern themselves with 
issues of racia l inequality, they fail 
to realize that sex ual inequality can 
be doubly hurtful to the same 
minority women they stri ve to 
assist. 

The most alarming part of this 
discrimination is that it affects men 
nearly as much as it affects women; 
these days, most families rely upon 

The UCSD Guardian 

co-workers. 
The fact that the "gap" is appar-

enl ly increasing in recent years can 
easi ly be explai ned by welfare 
reform. Because of welfare reform, 
many women who have not previ-
ously held jobs and have very low 
skill leve ls entered the job market 
for the first time. 

Naturally, they stan out at low

Families struggle to make ends 
meet On a dual income. Since both 
parents arc working, they must be 
able to pay extra for child care. 
Many families cannot afford the 
extra chi Id care, thus forcing one 
of the parents to stay at home. 
More often than nol. the woman 
must stay at home because her hus-
band ' salary is higher. This, of 
course, would not be the case if 

makes it appear as if women as a 
whole are losing ground, when in 
fact they are making gains at every 
other level. 

The bOllom line is that most 
women are making the conscious 
choice to prioriti ze families and 
children above ge lling an ex tra 
step ahead in the rat race of corpo-
rate cu lture. The fact that women 
can choose to focus their effort s

Raising women 's income to that

a small extent , to the ri se in the

Editor: 
One of Ihe things I was really 

looking forward to as I entered my 
third year at UCSD was the Library 
Walk Vendor Fair during the firsl 
week of clas\e\. What better way to 
start olT the year than by indulging 
in the desire for cheap material 
goods? As a friend and I were 
walking toward the Pri ce Center 
from Mandevi lle, the conversation 
was good and the mood was light 
until I was metaphYSically slapped 
in the face with tht! grotesque 
Image of an aborted hahy. 

Anyone who vi'lted Library 
Walk dunng tiN week knows exact -
ly what I am talking about. A man 
with a shin that reads 'Abortion is 
Murder" was standlllg proudly next 
to a 6-foot long image that boasted 
the phrase "Do you care?" 

As soon as I glanced at thi s 
ex tremely disturhing picture I 
reacted, probably the way this man 
wanted ml: to, and screamed (and I 
quote myoclf), "Oh my God, that 
offends me so mueh l" as I literally 
jumped and covered my face . 

For the past 36 hours my 
thoughts have been racing as to 
what I would say if I could confront 
him, how I could counter-protest 
and then [ asked myself, "Why wa~ 
this man allowed to do this?'" 

The First Amendment is a pecu-
liar thing. Of course thi s man has 
every right to preach what he 
believes women should and should 
not do with their bodies. 

We don't have to listen ; but how 
would the universily feel if I held 
up a sign that said "FUC K 
UCSD'!" Or, being an advocate of 
the pro-choice movement, if I 
brought out a 6-foot long poster of 
a woman who died in childbirth 

YOU'VE BEEN RAZZED FOR BEING SO ENERGETIC_ 
AROUND HERE, YOU'LL GET PROMOTED FOR IT. 

let 's get right 10 the point. You're looking for a career Ihal pUlS 
your brainpower lO work . One that gives you the freedom to make 
importanl decision - and the authority to make Ihem ny. And you 
wanl an opportunily that makcs Ihe most of every talcn~ YOll 
possess. One lhat finanCially rewards you for your contributions 
- not your tenure . Well guess what? You've just found it.

because abortion was illegal , to 
argue that ~he have an abortion to 
save her life because the life of her 
now motherless baby is more 
important than her own? 

What about a poster of a young 
teenager who couldn ' t get an abor-
tion due to parental consent law~, 
and so stahhed herself in the stom-
ach with a coat hanger (Irue ,tory) 
to kill the haby, but also ended up 
ending her own life'! 

Would I be allowed to do that ? I 
would not try it if I didn't think what 
thi, guy wa., dOing wa~ completely 
and ultt!r1y dl'gu.ting. I dream 01 
asking him if he would care for the 
hahy on that poster if it had lived, 10 
have an ahortlOn herst!Ir! Would he 
then he glad that it died ? 

I do not wi.h to express political 
view. in thi, leiter, and I know that 
there arc pro-lifer. out there that 
agree that thi S man is an ex tremc 
case. HoweVl!r, I would like the 
power, that he of the univer,it y to 
realize what they arc doing, and 
who is affected when Ihey allow 
this image to be displayed. 

During the time IllS poster wa~ 
displayed, there were quite a few 
young children selling candy near-
by who could potentially he dis-
turbed by thiS image. And if this 
man i~ not advocating views in 
favor of chi ldren, what is he doing? 

There arc olher ways for thi s 
man to express hi s views, but it 's 
about time that boundaries are set 
as to what the rights are of people 
who use the UCSD campus as their 
politi ca l bulletin board. Nobody 
want~ to sec a po,ter of a dead 
woman, as Illany do riot wish to ·ee 
a large poster of a dead baby, pro-
choice or not.

UCSF Scientist Wins Nobel Prize in Medicine 
SCIENCE: Prusiner 
receives award for 
work with prions 
By S. Javan Wygal 
Guardian Reporter 

Dr. Stahley B. Prusiner has 
become the 31 UC faculty member 
to win the world 's most prestigious 
prize. 

Last week the Nobel Assembly 
at the Karolinska Institute in 
Stockholm, Sweden, awarded its 
1997 Nobel Prize in Medicine to 
Prusiner, a professor of neurology, 
bioch.emistry and biophysics at UC 
San Francisco. 

No other public-university sys-
tem worldwide has won more 
Nobel Prizes than the University of 
California. Prusiner is one of the I7 
current UC faculty, including living 
emeriti , who arc recipients. 

UC President Richard Atkinson 
praised Prusiner in a statement 
issued after the Nobel Prize 
Commillee 's announcement last 
Monday. 

"We are enormously proud of 
Dr. Prusi ner for his pioneering 

CO-OP:

"~y role is to make sure that 
what we do as a Student Center 
doesn ' t hurt the image of the over-
all huilding," he ~ald. 

Xavier said staff and faculty 
members have asked him about the 
co-op's deci.ion . 

"People have been arproachmg 
me and saying ' Why art! you doing 
th .. ·/ ' My attitude is that they are a 

~tudent organi/ation and it is their 
responsibility," he said. "They also 
told me that if there was enough 
protest, they would stop selling the 
cigarettes. " 

Several co-op employees said 
they believe that staff and faculty 
have ulterior motives for question-
ing their decision to sell cigarettes. 

"People in the administration 
are not worried about health but 
rather competition for other busi-
nesses," Gonzales said. 

Xavier said he also feels that the 
sentiment of competition is a valid 
point. 

"People say 'Why can Ihe 
General Store sell cigarettes when 
olhers on campus cannol?'" he said. 

"We do whatever we can to boost 
sales," Gonzales said . "Even if peo-
ple come in and ask for a particular 
kind of candy, we get it for them." 

The most important part of the 
issue, Xavier said, is 10 get the 
campus community discussing 
smoking and cigarettes. 

"People feel strongly about it on 
both sides," he said. "It is a big 
issue and we need 10 discuss it 
more; we tend to argue but we need 
to discuss without judgmenl." 

The Associated Students has a 
Cooperative Oversight Committee, 
but A.S. President Sou ley Diallo 
said he is not sure whether the 
committee will review the co-op's 
decision to sell cigarettes. 

"The oversight committee has 
not reviewed this," Diallo said. 
"There is no uni versity policy 
against selling cigarettes on cam-
pus and I am inclined not to take a 
position on the issue. If a policy 
does come up, then that is a direct 
connict and there is an A.S. issue." 

research and the avenues it opens 
for our underslanding of the dis-
eases of Ihe nervous system," 
Atkinson said. "Dr. Prusiner's 
work is an example of what 
research universities do best -
advancing fundamental knowledge 
that so often has stunning practical 
benefits for individuals and soci-
ety." 

Citing a connection that dates 
back 10 1939, when Dr. Ernest O. 
Lawrence was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physics, Atkinson went on 
to place Prusiner's achievements in 
"the best tradition of the University 
of California. We are delighted to 
welcome another Nobel Laureate 
to the ranks of our faculty." 

Born in Des ~oines, Iowa, 
Prusincr, 55, has won numerous 
awards. 

After receiving his undergradu-
ate training and MD degree from 
the University of Pennsylvania. he 
went on to win numerous awards 
and honors including the Albert 
Lasker Basic Medical Research 
Award, the Potamkin Prize, the 
Wolf Prize, the 1. Elliot Royer 
Award, the Ehrlich-Darmstaeder

Awards, the Charles A. Dana 
Award and the ~ax-Planck ­
Forschungspreis. 

Dr, Prusiner was awarded the 
Nobel Prize in recognition of hi s 
discovery of "prions," a newly dis-
covered biological means of infec-
tion . Although unavailable for 
comment, in a statement released 
by UC San Francisco he credited 
the many years of hard work by hi s 
many talented colleagues for his 

success. 

Prusiner added prions to the list 
of well-known infectious agents, 
including bacteria, viruses, fungi 
and parasites. 

Although they exist nonnally as 
innocuous cellular proteins, prions 
possess an innate ability to convert 
their struclures into highly stablc 
arrangements that ultimately result 
in the formation of hannful parti -
cles, the causative agents of several 
deadly brai n diseases that affect 
both humans and animals. 

A II of the diseases are labeled as 
"dementia-type," and include 
CreutLfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD ), 
kuru. sc rapi e and Bovine 
Spongiform Encephalopathy 
(BSE), or "mad cow disease" as it 
is more cOlllmonly referred to. 

There are great variations in tht: 
incubation times and degrees of 
aggressiveness of the different 
priCln diseases, but without t!xcep-
tion they are all, to date, incurable 
and fatal. 

Prusiner began his work in 1972 
after one of his patients died of 
dementia related to CJD. It had 
been proven Ihat C1D, kuru and

scrapie, a disease affecting sheep, 
could be transmitted through con-
tact with infected tissue. He postu-
lated that the infectious agent 
lacked the hereditary material 
DNA or RNA, a hypothesis which 
flew in the face of accepted scien-
tific knowledge. 

After 10 years of work, Prusiner 
and his colleagues identified in 
1982 the infectious agent as a pro-
tein he named "prion," short for 
"proteinaceous infectious particle." 
Even then, the scientific communi-
ty offered only great skepticism to 
the unwavering Prusiner, who 
made it his life's work to define the 
nalure of this novel infectious 
agent. 

Prion diseases in humans can 
arise spol1laneously. be inherited by 
patient with a family history of 
prion disease or be acquired by an 
infection. Lacking genes, prions 
multiply all the same. Their protein 
is deri ved from a normal protein 
that is encoded by a gene found in 
all animals, including humans. 

Prusiner called this protein the 
"prion protein," or PrP. As

Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-Palo 
Alto). Scholarshare gives individu-
als and familics thc opportunilY to 
open savings accounts in which they 
deposit funds to prepare for future 
higher-cducation costs. Funds will 
be paid towards educational expens-
es once a student has becn accepted 
to a college or university. 

The Scholarshare trust will be 
administered by the California 
Student Aid Commission. Earnings 
on Scholarshare accounts will be 
tax-exempt for state filing purposes 
and federally tax-deferred. 

Although its companion bills 
successfully crossed the governor's 
desk, Wilson vetoed AB 1415 on 
Friday evening. AB 1415 - spon-
sored by Assembly Speaker Cruz 
Bustamanle (D-Fresno) - would 
have guaranteed California's uni -
versities at least the same share of 
the state budget for the next four 
years as they will be allocated in 
next year's budge!. Additional 
funding would have been availahlc 
if enrollment growth is larger then 
1.5 percent annually. 

"Governor Wilson has shorl -
changed sludents and their fami -
lies ," Bustamante said. "It docs lil-
tic good to reduce fees if sludents 
must pay for an additional year of 
college to gel I he classes they need 
to graduate." 

Davis and Ducheny will bc at 
UCSD on Tuesday. They will be 
discussing the future of higher edu-
cation and taking sludcnt questions 
on the Library Walk next to thc

Editor's Nightmare 
in the Express Line 

( have just arrived home after a 
horrible experience at the grocery 
store. Unable to rent my aggression 
or to exact the revenge I so long for, 
I a~ ~riting down my frustrations . 
Thu~"&efore you lies the results of 
my attempt to reconcile my last 
ex press lane experience. 

I could feel the growing anger 
of the man behind me. What an 
irascible curmudgeon. ( thought. 
So maybe I had one or two more 
items than I was supposed to; no 
one else in line seemed bothered by 
it. In fact, just to show my benevo-
lence toward my fellow shoppers, I 
told two girls who only had one 
item each to go ahead of me. Alas, 
this was not the day that God was 
to repay me for my kindness. 

As I reached the head of the 
Express Lane, the man behind me 
asked. "So how many items do you 
have there, fifteen?" Naively. I 
lurned around and smiled al him 
thinking he might be trying t~ 
make I ight of the mailer. I then saw 
the dourest face I have ever 
encountered. Lransfixing my gaze 
and causing my pulse to quicken 
several beats. 

Th(; man had a squarish jaw 
resembling that of a bulldog. which 
was made more fearsome by its 
contorted grimace. 

He was an older man, perhaps in 
his early sixties, heavy-sel, well-
dressed in a tan suit, and lugging 
two extremely large jugs of vodka. 
In fact, despite all the time I have 
spenl with Russians, I will admit 
that I have never seen such large 
jugs of vodka before. 

Suffice it to say that he was pur-
chasing enough vodka to host a 
party for every inebriated bum in 
San Diego. 

The nexl Ihing I nOliced were 
the man 's blue eyes. I do not know 
Illany people who arc not affected 
toward ~ome kind of compassion 
when luoking inlo my eyes. [ tlo 
nol say Ihis Olll 01 conceit. It is 
merely in my nature 10 ~how COIll -
pa~sion for others, and , whelher it 
may be considered fortunate or not. 
I am usually Ihe lirsllo receive il as 
well. As hi s eyes mel mine, howev-
er, they remained ~ I onc-cold . 

I Imve been in Ihe express lane 
quite a few times before. I used 10 
count my groceries to make sure r 
had no more Ihan ten. My counllng 
always resulls in a low number, 
however, and so I have since 
SlOpped picking through the gro-
ceries in my basket, eontident that 
only novice express lane shoppers 
need to counl Ihci r baskets. 

Unfortu nately, thi s limc my e~ti ­
mation proved wrong. There were 
too many things I needed 10 pur-
chase that day. The whole express 
lane shopping tnp had gone ou t of 
conlrol. 

"Docs il look like Ihere are more 
than fifteen '!" I asked Ihe man . 
incredulou\ . (Although il looked a\ 
though I had more than ten . I was 
conridenl ( had not more Ihan rif-
teen.) "Why don' t you count them," 
he ,aid in a 11l0d. lng. ,clt-nghleow.

sounded tenable. 
My next (and last) strategy was 

to ask the man if he would like to 
move in front of me. At this point 
the line had grown in length, and 
we had quite a few observers 
behind us. "No," he sa id very 
emphatically. "I do not want to go 
in front of you. I want you to be 
embarrassed for what you did." 
"Oh, I'm not embarrassed:' I 
replied , slightly red in the face. 
"You should be," he answered. 

At thi s point, I was so out-
raged . my voice tremulous. that I 
fea red to reply. and tried to con-
tent myself with keeping quiet. 
The man was not through, howev-
er. As I swiped my ATM card 
th rough the mac hine, he said, 
"And I don't think you're a llowed 
to use that. Cash only." 

Up until thi s point , no one had 
stood up for me. The two girls 
whom I allowed to cut in front of 
me just stood there picking up their 
bags of groceries, not engaging in

the debate. So much for lett ing 
them go in front of me. I thought. 
The whole ordeal was beginning to 

make me feel as if had eommitted a 
horrible crime. 

The checker also remained 
silent , although she had given me 
one or two sympathetic glances. 
She did venture to tell the man th at

failed to say so, Ralph 's had 
changed its policy to allow for the 
use of ATM cards. 

Her voice was not punitive 
enough to censure the man from 
making a few more disparaging 
remarks about me before I left, 
however. In fact . I think the check-
er was scared of him. As she 
pushed the receipt into my hand 
and lold me to "have a nice day," I 
could have sworn that her hand was 
trembling. 

After my ATM fiasco conclud-
ed, I grabbed my groceries and 
walked out the door. I have no way 
of knowing what would have hap-
pened if I had called this man a 
nast y old curmudgeon . By not

wonder what brought him to this

Mayb'C he hates his job. Maybe 
he is severely depressed or suffers

just had a bad day and too much 
vodka. Whatever the case, I am

An Alternative View of Nutrition 
UCSD professor highlights in book some of the finer points of dietary health 

By Je •• le. Scheppmann 
Associate Features Editor 

One of the first things student~ 
do when they leave home is to 
forget all the things their parents 
taught them about nutrition and 
having a balanced die\. "Eat 
nutritiou s foods, as close to the 
natural source as possible" is 
what you may remember hearing 
from your mother. However new 
theories in nutrition arc contra · 
dieting this. 

Joel Gurin and Ira Mothner, 
describe the nutrients everyone 
needs to live. Nutritious foods 
will not necessarily increase life 
expectancy, they say. Rather, 
healthy eating "permits the body 
to reach its ma}(imum genetic 
potentiaL" 

One of the more 
Interestl.., points 
taught In the

whole wheat rolls filled up on 
1,570 calories. A standard diet 
with more fats. sugars and pro-
teins required 3,000 calories. 

Sallman's book says that 
young adults rarely require 
unusual dietary needs, unless 
pregnant or lactating. 

UCSD Biology profe~sor of 
nutrition Paul Saltman and Linda 
Strause say that what you put into 
your body is of less importance 
than what you leave out within 
reason . 

Salt man and Strause teach a 
nutrition cour~e popular among 
both science and non-sc ience 
major~, largely because of its 
unconventional approach to nutri · 
tion. 

In The University of 
California San Diego Nutrition

Nutrition is a vital part of a 
healthy life sty le, and one of the 
most significant nutritional prob-
lems are deficiencies from diet-
ing, the authors say. Dieters will 
risk their health on fad di ets and 
fasting . The problem with these 
approaches. Salt man says. is that 
losing the weight i~ easy, but 
keeping it off is the challenge. 

The best approach to main-
taining a healthy weight and life 
sty Ie the best approach is still the 
low-fat. reduced-ca loric approach 
to eating , coupled with a regular 
exercise program. The proper di et 
wi II reduce caloric intake. but 
sti ll maintain all the necessary 
nutrients for healthy liVing. 

One of the more interesting 

points taught In the nutrition 
class is that pilla, with thc right 
toppings, is actually good for 

In addition, a twinkie is actu-
ally beller for you than is an 
apple because it contains more 
vitamins and nutrients important 
to the body's survival. 

According to a Michigan State 
University study, college students 
safe ly reduccd their weight by, 
"cating 12 sli ces of low-caloric, 
high-fiber bread per day, along 
with whatever else they wanted," 

The theory was that the bread 
consumption would increase their 
intake of complex carbohydrates 
and reduce their need for othcr 

typc~ of food . The students' over-
all caloric intake decreascd. 

University of Alabama study

"Food is love" says 
UCSD professor 
Continued from page 14 

Beyond the simple nutntive 
value, "food is love," Sahman says. 
"Food is life." Saltman's advil:e is 
to eat in moderation those foods 
that give us pleasure and supply us 
with our essential nutrients. 
Salt man condemns America 's 
obsessive nature and makes the 
plea, "Can't we just be good to our-
selves'?" 

In addition to his research on 
human nutrition, Saltman is abo 
well-known for his work in the San 
Diego public school system as the 
creator of UCSD's Science Institute 
for Elementary Teachers. 
Professors partaking in the program 
teach a group of elementary school 
teachers science and demonstrate 
its applications. 

The Im.titute enjoys wide· ranging 
succe~~, with five identical programs 
funded in California. Saltman says

wanted to say, "All you do is stuff 
your face." 

"What '!" she asked again, her 
mouth full of chewed-up cookie 
bits. I ran to the bathroom to vomit. 
When I came back , I took my sec· 
ond cookie. 

"What do you want to do?" she 
asked. 

I shifted my weight, thinking I 
would be sick again. I ran to the 
balhroomto vomit again. My stom-
ach was in knot . 

I left their house and crossed the 
~treet to the pay phone to tcll Illy 
parents to come and gel me . 

I remember another experience. 
when onc day. I fell in the kil chen. 
My mother and falher heard the 
thump and came running up the 

~Ialrs . They look me 10 the doctor 
the next day. The sccrctar; smiled 
as she always had . But this was nol 
the last time I would be there. 

My parents loved me so much 
they could not see the pain I was in. 
My stomach had slarted to digest 
itsel r. When you vomit a lot your 
body makes more stomach acid. 
and when Ihere is no food to absorb 
thi s acid, it naturally starts to digest 
your stomach. I had u leers -
sharp, shooting pains that dehilital -
cd my daily life. Yel, neither parent 
saw that there truly was a problem. 
I was my mother's perfecr lillie 
girl , and she was in denial that I 
l:Ould be otherwise. 

NUTRITION: 
Three ideas that 
promote good eating 
Continued from page 16 
themsel ves of calcium," he con-
tinues. 

In Tile University of 
California Nutrition Book , 
Saltman says there are three prin-
ciples upon which we should all 
base our good eating habits. The 
first is moderation, because 
overindulgence of any sort can be 

I often left the house, slowly, 
slyly, trying to get away from her. 

"Don't I get a hug?" my mother 
would say. 

I would return quickly to give 
her a hug. My knees felt weak and 
buckled under me for a moment. 
But I caught myself before 
Mommy could see. 

My mother took me shopping 
because I had grown too tall for last 
year's clothing. I took off my shin 
to try on a blouse. My mother 
gasped at what she saw. 

She s(Qod up to (Quch me but I 
backed away. My chest wa bruised 
from the ribs rubbing against into 
my skin - there were several small 
cuts were there from the bone 
yelling through. "You're kiliing 
yourself. You 're dying. Don't you 
see it? You 're dying," she cried 
hysterically. 

I stood in front of the mirror, my 
skin hung around my face. My hair 
was thinning out, falling out in 
clumps. My chest was black and 
blue from the scars of not having 
padding between my ribs and my 
skin. And my tooth-pick legs gave 
oul on me as I went crashing to Ihe 
floor. 

By thi s time, my skin clung to 
Illy bones. My blue eyes were a 
co ld gray, my lips were the color of 
blue blood. and my eyes. puffy 
from starvation. had bags large 
enough to carry groceries. My ribs 
poked through the skin causing 
c ut~ and bruises on the chest. The 
join l, were >wollen wllh ~harp 
pain. The skin that sagg.:d from my 
face became the color of decaymg 
flesh. Yet, I smiled at my own riv-
eting beauty of the nakednes~ . 

My mol her', eye> were -=louded 
with tears. "You're dying. You 're 
killing yourself. Don 't you see it'] 
You 're dying." I smiled with pride 
as my mommy cried. 

But her word~ are words I will 
not forget. The imagc I saw in the 
mirror was a picture that will haunt 
me for the rest of my lifc. The pain 
of , tarvation was a feeling I shall 
never allow myself to forgel. I 
would not allow this to control mc. 
I would regain wntrol over my life. 

dangerous for the body. 
The second is body conscious-

ness . "Listen to what your body 
has 10 say," wrote the authors. 
" It 's usually best to heed what 
your body 's hunger, thirst, 
fatigue, or satiety is telling you." 

The third recommendation is 
most important , Salt man says. 
Remember to keep variety in 
your diet. A wide selection of 
foods from all the basic food 
groups will ensure that you ingest 
all of the most important nutri -
ents for a healthy lifestyle.

How has college affected 

your eating l1abits? 
Interviews by Marc Comer 

Photography by Dave Lubitz 

I'm happier at college, so 
eat beller. I'm a lot l e~s 

stressed. My eating habits 
have improved. A lot of times 
I pack my lunch or go to the 
Food Co-op. 

F ........ Reed 
Revelle Junior 

I'm a lot more likely to 
forget my meals than usual. 
That, and I tend to eat at the 
most convenient place. So 
I'm probably not getting the 
most balanced diet. 

Roy Mumaw 
Muir Freshman 

Going to college has 
affected my eati ng habits by 
not having a regu lar routine. 
You know, just eating when-
ever. In between classes or 
whatever time is available. 
There 's no set schedu le like 
there was when I was home. 

Jeff Boymon 
Marshall Freshman 

It does affect my eating 
habits. I mean, I don't have 
time to cook. But that 's about 
it. 

Jennifer Won. 
Muir Junior 

I've never eaten that well, 
so it hasn't really changed. I 
mean, I live in the apartments 
now, so we can eat whatever 
we want. We eat a lot better 
'now because we didn't have 
any choice in the dorms.

'Killer' Bees Swatted 
SHUTOUT: UCSD's defense pitched the equivalent of a no-hit-
ter, allowing no shots on goal to overmatched Savannah College 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

Savannah (Ga.) College of 
Art & Design. The name alone 
sends chi lis down the spine of 
every Division III 
women 's soccer 

squad in America. 
The "killer" Bees 
buzz around the soc-
cer field with great 
speed and their 
intense pressure mehs 
the opposition's con-
fidence. 

Yeah, and UCSD will 
someday field a football 
squad. 

Truth be told, the Bees are 
just another average team - a 
team unlucky enough to cross 
through the Tritons' path to a 
third consecutive Division II! 
National Champion~hip . So, 
after looki ng at the final ~tatis ­
tiC ~heet (UCSD 32 ~hot~ ; 
SCAD 0 ~hot~), one would 
a"umc that the Triton~ ran olf 
with another dominating vil:-
tory. 

UCSD, however. ~queakcd 
out a 1-0 win over Savannah 
in front of 350 fans. The score 
could easily have heen more 
lopsided in favor nf the hlue 
and gold, but the Tnlnn, 
squandered many of their 
scoring chances. 

"We came out terrible ," 

Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "We were too 
casual. We ignored the things 
we've been doing and we 
forced everything. If we play 

like this, we ' re not 
going past the 
Western Regionals. 
The way we played, 
Cal Lu would have 
beat us by four or five 
goals." 

Amazingly, 
Savannah did not get 
a shot on goal the 

entire night as Triton netmin-
der Jennifer Hetland effort-
lessly recorded her ni nth 
s hutout, but the Bees had a 
couple of good scoring 
chances late in the second 
half. 

The game started out well 
enough for the home squad . In 
the 14th minute of play, senior 
forward Lauren Johnson's 
cros~ Irom the left sidelinc 
found a Mreaking Christy 
Ahi/aid on the right side of 
the field . Abizaid raced past 
the goalie, but did not have an 
angle to ~hoot. 

So with the graceful touch 
of a ballerina, the freshman 
forwaro di~hed the ball back 
to junior forward Alison 
Hurley. "Burly" Hurley wast-
ed no time in depositing the 
perfect pass into an empty net 

• 

for the game's first score. 
h wou Id be the only score, 

though, even though the 
Tritons tried vehemently to 
add to their lead. Senior mld-
fielder Brenna Cox did her 
best with a couple of shots on 
goal and mid fielder Toni 
Nunez tried five of her own 
without any luck. Freshman 
Cindy Dostalek also came off 
the bench to provide a much-
needed spark on the offensi ve 
end. 

Throughout the contest, the 
Triton defense kept possession 
of the ball with four-yea r 
starter Maricela Oceguera tak-
ing charge of the air as she 
won numerous SO-50 balls in 
the air for UCSD. Steady 
sweeper Beth Freeburg, Lisa 
Wilkinson and Janine Harispe 
rounded out the stining Triton 
defensc. 

"I have no idea why we 
cou ldn 't score marc," 
Oceguera ~aid . " We ju,t 
weren ' t very lucky tonight. I 
don ' t think we have playeolo 
our potential yet. We're 
almost there, we just ha ve n' t 
shown it on the field yet." 

UCSD will now begin 
preparation for its batt le 
against California Baptist thi s 
Wednesday night. The game 
will begin at 7 p.m. at Triton 
Soccer Stadium.

Running To The Playoffs 
READY TO ROLL: Preparations continued for this weekend's important 
UCSD Triton Invitational as the men and women tuned up against UCI • R~du(~ ..... 

• R~du(. ftu.lil~ 
By Kevin McLau&hlln 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Midterms are still around the 
bend, the weather is just turning 
cool and already Ihe campaign is 
coming to a climax for the 
Triton cross country tcam. 
Only six weeks removed 
from the season opener, 
the team is facing ib final 
competition before the 
Ca lifornia Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championships In 
Pomona on Oct. 25. 

Next week the team hosts the 
annual Triton Invitational, and as a 
tunc-up the squad ran its "B" team 
this past weekend on the same 
home course. Facing off against the 
Anteaters of UC Irvine on a breezy 
Saturday morning, the second 
squad ran well, if without the usual 
results of the first team . 

While the top five men and 

women rested, the rest of the team 
raced on. Leading the way for the 
men was Neal Harder, who lin-
ished third overall, followed by 
Kevin Prindiville, Steve Walsh, 

Nathan Garcia and Conor 
Medley. The race marked 
a major improvement for 
Prindiville, Wabh, Garcia 
and a number of other run-

ner~ . 
For the women, Lisa 

Klinger and Liana Wright 
finished within three ~ec ­
ond~ of each other to set 

the pace with a pair of bold races. 
Rebecca Locken, Kristi O'Grady 
and Kri sten Kocnig finished in a 
pack to round out the top five 
ladies. However, bOlh the men and 
women were edged in the overall 
results hy UCI. 

"Every race is a learning experi -
ence. We had some really good per-
formances," sa id Triton Head

Coach Ted Van Arsdale. "We didn't 
win the war. but we had a lot of 
individual battles we won." 

Attention now turns to the 
Invitational , the final meet of the 
year before the postseason rolls 
around. The Tritons ran well 
against a large and diverse field last 
year and look to repeat that perfor-
mance as they buckle Jown for 
another l: harge at Iht: National 
Final,. The In vitational will answer 
many questions about tht: playoff 
lineup. Panil:u larly on the women's 
~idc, the team is tightly-spaced and 
a number or individuals could 
make a move to the top IS this 
weekend. 

"The women are running tight 
and fast. The essence of what 
they ' re doing is that they have to 
earn their way," sa id Van Arsdale. 
"We' re ahead of schedule right 
now with our individuals, so we're 
able to work on strategic things."

26 SPORTS 

SAD DIEGO: 
This fine city should 
get no NBA love 
Continued from p.e- 28 
how many screaming fans there 
were at the game - zero. How 
about dead-quiet fans? There were 
10,754 of them, 2,246 short of a 
sellout. And you wonder why the 
Rockets and Clippers split town. 

Any city that makes the Sports 
Arena sound qUiet doesn't 
de~erve a team. The only thing 
that made the fans exci ted was the 
ent rance of 6-foot- 11 Denver for-
ward Joe Woll from the player\' 
tunnel. JOE WOLF! The appre-
cia ti ve benchwanner (a nd 

eanderthal man look alike) 
greeted the ~cn.:aming fans with 
high lives. In lact. he actually 
stopped to distribute props to the 
ali-too-appreciative idiots. 

Three: thi s city has no Idea 
how to support a team. San Diego 
is America'~ Finest City, right'! 
What a fine city, one which has 
lost two NBA teams in the last 26 
years. The Rockets packed their 
bags for Houston in 1971 and 
went on to win two champi-

onships in the '90s. The sorry 
Clippers left to become L.A. 's 
econd team in 1984. 

What a city, one whose base-
ball team has made the playoffs 
twice in its 28-year history. The 
Padres, who won the National 
League West in 1996, couldn't 
even se ll out a playoff game. 

San Diego, a city which lost its 
minor league hockey team, the 
Gulls, to Long Beach. Now we 
are left with the new Gull~, a team 
which is on the last rung of the 
minor league hockey ladder. 

Where. oh where are all those 
Charger fan~ who emerged when 
the Stupor Bolt~ made the Super 
Bowl in 1995'1 

So there you have it, kids. San 
Diego was just never made to be 
a big-time ci ty. one that could 
handle the fla~h and glitL of the 
NBA. It's sad that a city of over a 
million people can' t even get 
excited about big-time NBA 
aetion. As for me, l'1l watch my 
NBA action on TV. San Diego 's 
one shining beacon of hope, the 
only way it could possibly secure 
an NBA team, can be summed up 
in four words - Head Coach 
Marv Albert. Enough said.

the Stag defender. When the pass 
got to him, all Kudirka had to do 
was redirect it a little and put it by 
Claremont 's goalie Caleb Kelly. 

After that seore, UCSD went 
two for four on its six-on-five~, a 
percentage which is a great deal 
beller than their 18 percent show-
ing of la~t weekend. 

" We emphasilcd six-on-fives 
in practice but didn't exclusively 
work on It," Mecham ~aid. 
"During the game , we ,cltled 
down and did what we needed to 
do. Everyone was relaxed," 

Defensively for the game. 
UCSD was ~crappy. The Stags 
had more than their fair share of 
trouble getting the ball into their 
hole set because every time they 
tried , either Mecham or teammate 
senior Adam Bollenbach would 
force a turnover with either a 
quick tip or a vice grip hold that 
was beyond escape. Offensively, 
the accuracy that the team had 
been lacking thus far was sudden-

"We pulled everything togeth-

er," Cole said. "We were swim-
ming hard and made our shots. 
We were about 50 percent on 
shooting, pUlling away our coun-
terattack opportunities and man-
up opportunities. It was one of 
our best, if not our best game of 
the year so far, but we still need to 
have a good week of practice and 
a ~ouple good games this week to 
get ready for the NorCal tourna-
ment." 

Harper was happy about the 
win, but it wa, ev ident that he 
will never allow hi s Tritons to let 
their guard down against the 
upset-minded Stag~ . 

"(Claremontl used to coat tail 
u, and get a lot of wins in the 
SCIAC League." Harper said . 
"They would get p,yched and 
they upset us a couple of times." 

The Tritons play two games 
this week, one on Wednesday at 
3:30 p.m. against Chaminade and 
the other on Thur,day against 
Princeton University at 6 p.m. at

defensive run, bringing the ball 
down the sideline. He then hit a 
beautiful cross into the box, where 
freshman midfielder Dana Cariss 
was there to finish it off with an 
out standi ng header. 

Junior midfielder Alex Glebov 
added the six th goal after a nice 
assiM from junior Jacob Bollinger. 
Bollinger also had the as,ist on the

The Tri tons are gelling better

They began the season withollt 
much fanfare, but Head Coach 
Derek Armstrong 's youngsters are 
playing very good soccer. 

UCSD's next game is tonight at 
home against Christian Heritage. 
As the Tritons begin their run at the 
postseason, things are looking 
good for them. It bodes well that 
the have five of their last six games 
at home, and are beginning to gel 
into a very solid squad.

Bees Squished Against Triton Windshield 
EARLY AND OnEN: Appr~aching a long homestand, the Tritons peppered a poor Savannah (Ga.) College of Art & Design 
squad with 23 shots on goal leading to a 7-1 smashing of the Bees before hundreds at RIMAe Field last Friday night 
By Tr."ls Hili 
Sports Editor, 

Imagine climbing Ml. Everest 
- naked. OK, maybe not naked, 
but it's a difficult climb regardless 
of what you're wearing. Then 
imagine following up that grueling 
climb with another climb - up the 
Snake Path at Giesel Library. Two 
experiences on different ends of the 
spectrum, similar only in the fact 
that they were climbs. 

That was the kind of experience 
the UCSD men's occer team had 
in its last four games. The first 
three matehes were Mt. Everest-
esque: Division m wars against 
Pomona-Pitzer College. The 
Master's College and California 
Lutheran University (a.k.a. Cal Lu, 
a.k.a. our biggest rival , a.k.a. a 
bunch of losers from Thousand 
Oaks). 

intrigue was which Triton would 
score next and in which way, it is 
interesting to find out that the first 
time the Tritons knew anything 
about their opponents was when 
the Bees took the field in warm-
ups. 

UCSD has never taken the field 
against the Bee from Georgia 
before, and it had no scouting 
reports to speak of before game 
time. 

Despite going into the game 
somewhat unprepared, the Tritons 
nevertheless looked dominant. 
Their passes and runs were beauti -
fully executed, so much so that the 
game was basically over after 15 
minutes. The only question after 
that was how bad the blowout 
would be. 

Junior forward Anthony 

The Tritons did very well on 
their climb, and while they could 
have easily made it to the top und.:-
feated, they ended up with a win 
and two ties. 

Then came last Friday's game 
against Savannah (Ga.) College of 
Art & Design, which wasn't even 
~omparable to climbing up that 
annoying scaled pathway. Thi s 
match was more like walking from 
the Price Center to Warren Lecture 
Hall. Safe to say, it was an easy vic-
tory. 

Funicello led things off with a nice 
goal in the 11th minute. He took 
advantage of a brilliant through 
pass from sophomore Brady 
Bernard that left him one-on-one 
with the keeper and put the Tritons 
up 1-0. 

Claire Schneider/Guardian 
C.ady frOlll • 1NIb,: Sophomore midfielder Cameron Adams shows 'another helpless Bee how it 's 
done as he motors by. Adams and the Tritons have five of their last six games at RIMAC Field. 

In the 15th minute, senior mid-
fielder Doug McBride scored in the 
same fashion as the lirst goal was 
scored . Funicello, remembering 
how easy it was for him to score 
after a great pass, dished the 
through ball to McBride. 

In the 38th minute Bernard got 
into the act again, netting a goal 
after a good pa~s from fre~hman 

defender Tyler Thompson . 
Now the game was really over. 

The Tritons were determined not to 
let their opponents work their way 
back into the game. They continued 
to be the aggre 50r, taking it to the 
Bees. 

In the 41 st minute. three min-
utes after Bernard\ scar.:, sopho-
mure Wes Robem scored a beauti-

ful goal. He was deep in Bee terri-
tory, not more than 15 yards from 
the left comer flag . He then sent a 
floating cross into the box that 
arched in between the outstretched 
arms of the keeper and the right 
POM , making the ,core 4-0 at half-
t i Ill':. 

The second hal r was just as fun 
as the first half for the Tritons, even 
though they did lose the shutout on 
a penalty kick hy Bce forward 
Jason Bunch. Out~idc of that, the 
gonl puny continued. 

The fifth goal for UCSD was 
quit e possibly the prettiest.

Jonah Freedman 
NBA to San Diego? 
Fu-gedaboutit! 

"II admit it. I wa~ wrong -
dead wrong. Last year, following 
the Lakers-Rocket\ exhibition 
showdown at the San Diego 
Sports Arena, I wrote in thiS very 
l:olumn that San Diego was ready 
to take an NBA team under lis 
wing, finally making thi~ town a 
hig-lime l:ity. Well, two words 
come to mind aft er last 
Thursday 's NBA exhihition game 
at the Sports Arena - ~crew that. 

What the hell was [ thinking? 
Thur\day night , the BA 

hrought one of its mmt exciting 
tcam~ to San Dlcgo - the Los 
Angelc .. Laker~ - and om.: 01 
ih least eXl:i ting team\ - the 
Denver :--Juggets - ror an ex hi -
hi ti on ~howdown It was a treat. 
at the 'cry least, tor tim hasket -
ha ll-\larved l: lty. The al: tion did 
not disappOint. The Lakers 
waxed the Nougats hy a final 
s(;Ore of 135-102. 

It '\-as a hlast. Nineteen-yea r-
old Lal..er phenomenon Kohe 
Bryant led the way wllh J I 
POIll\'" ,,,hi le the Shag Diesel 
scored 2.1 points In Just 22 min-
utes. The last pace 01 the game 
was elec trifYing - scoring, 
dunking, scoring, a hlocked shot 
or two and more dunking. 

It was enough action to make 
any haskethall fan drool. But 
sorry San Diego, there is no way 
this city deserves any love from 
the NBA. Uncle Jonah is go ing 
to explalll to all you kiddies why 
this cit y is pathetic and will 
never get Jal:k from the hig-time 
roundhall gods. 

One: The Sports Arena sucks. 
Have you seen thi s place? You 'd 
swear you were going to a roller-
derby. It 's old, cmsty, poorly-
maintained and looks like a dis-
cotheque. The sound inside is 
garhage. The awusti cs arc so 
had, it sounds like you' re li sten-
ing to musie in a wind tunnel. 
The mUSical selections arc so 
old, San Diego residents are 
prohably havi ng flashbacks to a 
nightly lipper hlowout. 

[' II put it this way - here are 
some of the greatest hit s heard 
at the mighty Arena (while the 
game was in play, I might add): 
"Kung Fu Fighting," "Danger 
Zone," "The Boys are Back in 
Town" and "2 Legit 2 Quit." 
Please Hammer, don ' t hurt 'em. 

This crappy arena couldn ' t 
host the Ice Capades, much less 
an NBA team. One last note that 
says it all (my roommate was 
kind enough to remind me) -: 
the next event at the world-
famous San Diego Sports 
Arena? Exciting WWF action. 
Oooooh yeah!!! 

Two: San Diego fan are 
pathetic. There's a professional 
basketball game here once 
every, what, 365 days? Let 's see

POUNDING: A the postseason draws near, the UCSD men 's water polo squad continues to gain 
momentum as they blowout Claremont College in front of a raucous Canyonview Pool crowd 

Claire Schneider/Guardian 
Blanketed: Sophomore two-meter defensive specialist Ross Mecham lives up to his billing as he shuts down another Stag from 
Claremont College . Mecham also came up big on the offensive end, leading the Tritons in scoring as they cruised to an easy victory.

Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The words "Hey Beer Man" 
could he heard from the Claremont 
College Stags hench Saturday night 
at Canyonview Pool. Anything 
would suffice to drown out the sor-
rows of a 17-8 shellacking at the 
hands of a rej uvenated UCS D 
men's water polo team. 

With the UCS D Pep Band in 
allendance to fire up the near-
capacit y l:rowd, an upset was out of 
the question from the get-go. 
Admilledly, a near-capacity crowd 
might be a slight exaggeration, but

nevertheless, for the second home 
game in a row, a large turnout 
fueled another Triton horne victory. 

Fans impersonating Saturday 
Night Live's Hans and Franz could 
be heard in the crowd ye lling 
numerous in~ult s at the opposition, 
among which were threats of bodi -
ly hann "to the little gi rlie men"

In tbe past, Claremont College 
was an arch-rival of UCSD\, how-
ever, in recent years, the Stags have 
not fared well. Claremont belongs 
to the SCIAC League, which is
