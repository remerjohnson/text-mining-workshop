Rep. Davis discusses 
tiigher education 

Congresswoman addresses 
financial aid at UCSD 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

Congresswoman Susan Davis 
(D~San Diego) met with a small 
group of UCSD students on 
April 12 to talk about current 
issues in higher education. After 
the forum, the San Diego Israel 
Alliance hosted a dinner with 
Davis and other student organi-
zations to discuss ways to 
increase cominunication between 
the groups. 

Hosted by Associated 
Students, the forum allowed stu-
dents and Davis to discuss the 
range of chalJenges facing higher 
education. According to Davis, 
the main problems are focused 
around the inadequate funds. 

"Part of what . everyone is 
grappling with is a limited pot of 
money," Davis said. "My greatest 
concern is that, for young people, 
they will find that maybe [educa-
tion] will be a harder road than 
they thQught. " 

"The forum focused on the reau-
thorization of the Higher 
Education Act, the legislation that 

allows the federal government to 
provide federal aid to college stu-
dents. The bill determines alloca-
tions for federal programs such as 
the Pell Grants and Stafford Loans. 
According to Davis, Congress is 
looking into how financial aid 
should be awarded. through Pell 
Grants and whether entidement or 
eligibility should be raised. 

"We really need to support 
[students], and 1 think we need to 
support education to a greater 
extent," Davis said. "I'm really 
dismayed with what's happening 
'right now. The fact that more 
students are possibly going to be 
discouraged to attend a universi-
ty ... that's not the direction we 
should be going." 

A member of the House 
Committee on Education and the 
Workforce, Davis spoke about 
concerns brought up in 
Congress, including online class-
es and whether there should be 
caps on fee increases. According 
to Davis, another concern is ways 
in which students can consolidate

Fox first permanent 
female chancellor 

By GAlw FAURE 
News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents 
unanimously confirmed Marye 
Anne Fox as UCSD's new chan-
ceJlor on April 12 . Fox, a 
renowned chemist who currendy 
serves as chancellor of North 
Carolina State University, wiU 
talce office Aug. 16. 

Fox will become the seventh 
chancellor of UCSD. She is the 
first woman to be appointed per-
manent chancellor ofUCSD. 

"I follow in extraordinary 
footsteps, and 1 am humbled in 
accepting the enormous chal-
lenge of accelerating the momen-
tum of UCSD," Fox said at a 
press conference immediately fol-
lowing her appointment. "To 
those outside the university, it 
might sound brash to talk about 
what is, and has been, a phenom-
enal pace of progress. Those 
inside the university know I have 
no other choice. The words 
'maintain' and 'mediocre' are not 
in the UCSD vocabulary." 

Fox was introduced by UC 
President Robert C. Dynes, 

Resolution 
to censure 
Gallagher 
withdrawn 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

A resolution censuring A.S. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher 
for sending an e-mail in which he 
announced his decision to vote for 
President-elect Jenn Pae in the 
AS. runoff election was not con-
sidered by the A.S. Council on 
April 14. 

As an item of immediate con-
sideration, the resolution required 
a two-thirds vote to be discussed. 
The motion to make the resolu-
tion IOIC failed 6-13 with two 
abstentions. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Junior Senator Kate Maull submit-
ted the item late on April 9 before 
the results of the A.S. runoff elec-
tion were announced. However, 
she withdrew the resolution after 
the vote to make it IOIC failed. 

"As a candidate ... you are 
forced to watch what you're wear-
ing at all times, you have to learn 
to zip up your sweatshirt before

UCSD's former chancellor. With 
the help of a search advisory com-
mittee composed of students, 
staff and faculty, Dynes chose Fox 
to fill the position he left after 
being named the university's 
president in October 2003. 

"I hadn't realized that this was 
going to be hard," Dynes said. 
"Today I'm reaJly announcing 
my successor, and the part that's 
really hard on me is that I \mow 
she's going to show me up." 

In the international search, 
over 300 candidates were con-
tacted for the position, Dynes 
said. The selection committee 
then reviewed over 50 candidates 
in a months-long process. 

This was not the first time 
Fox had been approached by'the 
University of California. 

"I have known Marye Anne 
Fox for many years, and while I 
was president I tried to recruit 
her to join the UC system," for-
mer UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson said in a statement. "I 
failed, but am truly delighted 
that we have now succeeded."

Authorities are searching for 
lS-year-old Sixth College frc h-
man Daniel Lee Cho, who was 
reported missing at 2 a.m. on April 
14. It is believed that he was carried 
away from shore by a strong rip 
current off La Jolla Shores State 
Beach while wading in hallow 
water. 

Two female friends were also in 
the water and were barely able to 
get to shore safely. The women 
reportedly tried to rescue Cho, 
but were nearly carried off by the 
current themselves. 

The search went from "rescue 
mode" to "recovery mode" at 
p.m. on April 14, according to life-
guard lieutenant Brant Bass.

I BRIEFLY 
Neurotoxin discovered in 

San Diego seawater 
Researchers from Scripps Institution of 

Oceanography have recently documented the 
presence of a neurotoxin In the San Diego 
seawater that is poisonous to marine mam-
mals, birds and humans who consume shell-
fish. 

In the past few years, increasing numbers 
of sea lions have been found sick or dead on 
San Diego beaches. Researchers found that 
many were poisoned by neurotoxin domoic 
acid, produced by marine phytoplankton. 
Production of domoic acid has in the past only 
been documented in waters further north of 
San Diego. 

Scripps researchers Lilian Busse and 
Elizabeth venrick found moderate levels of 
domoic acid in the phytoplankton from seawa-
ter samples collected on Feb. 18 and Feb. 25 
off Scripps Pier. Produced by a genus of 
diatoms called pseudonitzschia, the presence 
df the toxins coincided with a late February 
bloom of pseudonitzschia australis and is con-
sidered to be related to sea lions from Malibu 
8each being stranded in San Diego. 

Researchers said that pubUc nealth risks in 
San Diego are low despite the presence of the 
neurotoxin. According to studies, the amount of 
domoic acid in mussel tissue was found to be 
within state safety guidelines. 

Researchers are current~ starting a multi-
institutional monitoring project that takes week-
ly sampling~ of local water and mussels. The 
project tests San Diego waters in order to char-
acterize large blooms of pseudonitzschia and 
other types of phytoplankton.

admissions testing and will explain the 
changes to the Scholastic Aptitude Test that 
will De included in the fall 2006 test of the

Auditorium. 

In 2001, Atkinson delivery a speech to the 
American Council of Education, proposing that 
universities change the way student applica-
tions are evaluated during admission process-
es. Atkinson recommenaed eliminating the 
SAT and replacing it with a new test that mea-
sures what students leam in high school. The 
test he proposed would include an essay sec-
tion.

Local community leaders speak 
up against cuts to outreach 

By USA MAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

A group of community leaders 
gathered at a conference at the San 
Diego Memorial Academy Charter 
School on April 13 to speak against 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's pro-
posed budget cuts to higher educa-
tion. 

The conference, organized by 
the San Diego chapter of 
Supporters of Educational Equality 
and Diversity, focused on the nega-
tive consequences of eliminating 
academic outreach programs, 
retention programs and financial 
aid for low-income, first generation 
and historically underrepresented 
srudents. 

"S.£.£.D . .. . is an organization 
that is statewide, that is attempting 
to inform the governor that the 
decision [the governor) made in 
January to eliminate programs dut 
benefit services to low-income, 
underrepresented, educationally 
disadvantaged students is a mistake, 
and not good for the state of 
California," Gus Chavez, a mem-
ber of S.£ .£.D. and a retired 
Educational Opportunity Program 
direcror at San Diego State 
University, said. 

According ro a report from 
S.E.E.D., the proposed budget 
cuts would reduce $85 million 
from financial support for academ-
ic outreach programs, including 
533.3 million from the University 
of California. They stated that 
programs would also be consoli-
dated, which would "reduce services 
for students. 

"Probably one of the biggest 
concerns that we have is that as the 
demographic shift has occurred in 
California, where historically 

underrepresented communities are 
now becoming the majority in the 
state ... we're finding [a) proposal 
to eliminate all early outreach aca-
demic preparation progra",!s," 
Chavez said. 

The report also stated that 20 
percent of the state's high schools 
supply 55 percent of the seniors 
admitted to the University of 
California, highlighting the dis-
parities among educational 
resources at different high 
schools. The state's investment in 
such programs ranges from $26 to 
$220 per student per year, a mod-
est investment, according to 
S.E.E.D. 

"1 think that the budget cuts are 
particularly damaging to the young 
people - the chance for outreach 
[and) the chance to learn how to 
become a professional [are] very 
important," Douglas Oden, presi-
dent of the San Diego chapter of 
the National Association for 
Advancement of Colored People, 
said. "If you want to have an oppor-
tunity for these young people to 
become successful citizens, you 
have to have access to the educa-
tional system." 

Financial aid for students will 
also be reduced by $122 .7 million, 
including $50 million for UC stu-
dents, according to the report. 
FortY-five percent of undergraduate 
students at the University of 
California and California State 
University systems have been deter-
mined to need financial support. 

According to Chavez, the elim-
ination of academic outreach pro-
grams and financial aid, along 
with rising ruition costs, will 
result in the redirection of over 
7,000 students from the UC and 
CSU systems to community col-

leges. 
Freshman enrollment at UC 

and CSU campuses will be 
decreased by 10 percent in the fall. 

"One of the most important 
things right now is that the access 
is being denied, the affordability is 
being denied, and the first thing 
that the governor said he would be 
is accountable for the education 
and the children of the state," 
Jimma McWilson, executive vice 
president and chief operating offi-
cer of the San Diego Urban 
League said. 

Speakers at the conference 
emphasized the negative long-
term effects of the governor's pro-
posals. 

"It seems to us that what the 
governor has proposed is being 
penny-wise, but pound-foolish," 
Ray Uzeta, president and chief 
executive officer of the Chicano 
Federation, said. "Disenfranchised 
communities of color ,.. are the 
future workforce of this state, so in 
that sense, they are the people ... 
who are going to become the future 
middle-class and upper-class work-
ers and taxpayers of the state." 

The community leaders attend-
ed a major press conference, rally 
and hearing on April 14 in 
Sacramento and presented the gov-
ernor with over 8,000 signatures 
from students and parents through-
out the state protesting the educa-
tional budget cuts. 

"What we're saying here is that 
the investment that we're making 
right now to pay for these academ-
ic preparation programs (and) aca-
demic retention programs in the 
long run are going to be for the 
better of the state of California -
economically, socially [and] educa-
tionally," Chavez said.

New chancellor's speech 
slighted undergrads 

Chancellor, thy name is Fox. UCSD 's next 
chancellor, Marye Anne 
Fox, spoke at a press con-
ference on April 12. Some 
of her remarks hold 
promise for UCSD, while 
others leave a sour taste in 
the mouths of undergrad-
uates. 

UCSD alumni "occupy 
positions of importance" 
in the world, Fox 
explained. But, she said, 
"we have not come close 
to fully integrating" th em 
into UCSD's "skill set." 
It 's common knowledge 
that our alumni giving rate 
is atrocious, but what is 
Fox's plan to improve it? 
Alumni invest in their 
alma maters only when 
they have pride in those 
schools. It's not enough to 
simply reach out and ' ask 
them for contributions. 

We have to work on 
improving the lives of 
undergraduates now, so 
when UCSD solicitors 
come calling in the future, 
alumni will look back on 
their lives at UCSD with 
fond memories, not bitter-
ness. When students take 
pride in their experience at 
UCSD, they will also take 
pride in giving back to the 
school. Fox must recog-
nize the importance of stu-
dent life - both to the 
current campus climate 
and to the future success 
of the university. 

Indet:d, Fox's speech 
almost completely ignored 
the average student - not 
once did she even mention 
the word "undergraduate." 
Her tunnel-vision focus on 
research and "collabora-
tion" with corporations is 
troubling. There is a point 
at which corporate part-
nerships become not a sign 
of synergy, but a sign of 
selling out; and naming 
engineeri ng buildings 
after CEOs is less about 
philanthropy and more 
about getting ~ headstart 
on harvesting the latest 
crop of young minds to 
work at Qualcomm. 

The new chancellor 
would do well to remem-
ber that, at the end of the 
day, this is a public univer-
sity - not a high-tech 
trade school. There's 
nothing wrong with 
acceptiny corporate dona-
tions, 0 course, but that 
should not be Fox's fore-
most priority as chancel-
lor. 

Another unsettling facet 
of Fox's appointment is 
her salary: $350,000 per 
year ~ a 24.7 percent 
increase over the previous 
chancellor and $59,500 
more than the average UC 
chancellor. Coupled with 
her $87,500 "relocation 
allowance," this extra va-

. . 

gance IS unnecessary In a 
time of budget cuts else-
where in the university. 
Contrast this with the 
salary of Robert Dynes -
UCSD chancellor-turned-
UC President - who 
makes $395,000 per year,· 
18 percent less than the 
national average for his 
position. 

But Dynes wasn't a per-
fect chancellor, and Fox 
implicitly acknowledged 
this. 

With the UC president 
at her side, Fox promised 
to "do a better job of inte-
grating students of diverse 
backgrounds" into the uni-
versity. Outreach pro-
grams have been nearly 
obliterated this year, and 
such programs need all the 
help they can get. Fox 
wants the "circle of oppor-
tunity" to be "as wide as 
possible." She will not just 
double our efforts to bring 
in new students - she will 
"redouble" them. 

Fox won't take office 
until August, but in the 
interim she should take 
some time to explore the 
campus and ~alk to under-
graduates. 

If she's concerned about 
building better relation-

THURSDAY, APRIL IS, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

When 'standing for something' meant something 
Political slate's slogan, A.S. elections in general invite usual ridicule; 

Admit Day tips to entice prospective freshmen to UCSD 
horse's 

mouth 
EdWu 

EVery year this column mocks the annual "Rite of Spring" here at UCSD: An orgy of 
recriminations, petty complaints, 
and enough incest, nepotism. and 
cronyism to make a typi~1 third-
world republic look like 
Switzerland. Once again, A.S. elec-
tions have concluded and those few 
students who actually bother to fol-
low them are most likely elated, 
because their cronyism has tri-
umphed once again. Once again, a 
marginal portion of the student 
populace has voted in an entire 
(well. almost entire) slate of "lead-
ers" whose major qualification 
seems to be a willingness to fund 
their native clubs with everyone 
else's money. As this writer's room-
mate put it, "I got an e-mail from 
the election commissioner of 
Warren or such-and-such that said 
'a vote for apathy is a vote for 
losers' or something like that. Why 
can't 1 vote to get this person not to 
send me e-maiIs?" The rooounate 
in question responded by voting 
"abstain" to every position on the 
Earl Warren CoUege ballot. 

This writer remembers a time 
when A.S. elections meant that 
every position was actually con-

tested. This year's election not 
only featured several uncontested 
positions, but • slogan by the 
prominent slate (the ironically 
titled "Student's First" - which 
would more aptly be named 
"S.O.L.O. and Greek organiza-
tions off the ship first before 
women and children") that was 
begging for mockery: "Stand for 
Something." If the sheer inanity of 
that slogan was not enough, this 
writer had to see it under every 
fucking position on the ballot. It is 
as if they feel so secure in their 
prospects for election that they 
want to drive prospective voters to 
take a drill to their parietal lobe, 
to get the bad slogan out. 

"Stand for Something?" Wow-
let us make a principled stand about 
... something. Let us go lobby the 
administration about ... SOmething. 
Let us disguise the fact that our 
entire purpose in these positions is 
to advance the cause of our own 
select group at the monetllry 
expense of all students, while telling 
them we are advancing their cause 
of ... something. For an amateur 
political scientist, this entire situa-
tion is rather fascinating, as it is a 
microcosm of American domestic 
politics in its debate over inane 
issues that the politicians have no 
control over (parlcing, economic 
cycles. minority enrollment, etc.) at 
the.expense of any exposure of the 
vast corruption of the system 
(Washington lobbyists. S.O.L.O. 
orgs, agriculture subsidies, A.S. 
External). 

UCLA Summer Sessions 

The most pIling example of this 
hypocrisy and cronyism is Srudents 
FJnt! presidential candidate Harish 
Nandagopal's insistence that the 
$175,000 A.S. budget shortfall next 
year from decreased enroUment be 
met by fee increases on students 
while arguing against fee increases 
on students by the state (which the 
A.S. CoWlCil has literally ~ro lob-
bying influence over - this is a 
question for the UC Board of 
Regents and the governor). 

" ... let this be no 
endorsement of the new 
A.S. president, wlwse 
Jxmdering to athletics is 

disgusting. " 
Incidentally, despite Mr. 
Nandagopal's defeat at the hands of 
Jenn Pae, let this be no endorsement 
of the new A.S. president, whose 
pandering to athletics is disgusting: 
She has openly discussed funneling 
A.S. funding - money contributed 
by all students - toward a budget 
shortfall in athletics. One would 
think athletics already has enough 
student money from the pivision IT 
fee referendum, but apparently even 
more general student money needs 
to be allocated to a select group o( 
students (athletes) for whom the vast 

majority of this campus has no need 
nor cares. So instead of cronyism for 
S.O.L.O. orgs and Greeks, we get 
cronyism for athletics. So who is 
wondering why UCSD has a repu-
ation for apathy? 

Speaking of apathy, a few thou-sand prospective freshmen descend onto this campus on 
Saturday whilst a few undergradu-
ates - and the whole of the admis-
sions office at UCSD - try to con-
vince them this school is a fun and 
exciting place to be. It's too bad 
their parents will probably be with 
them, otherwise a free distribution 
of condoms and tequila might do 
the triclc. Regardless of whether 
this place is actually the hotbed of 
apathy it is purported to be. it is in 
every UCSD student's interest to 
attract the best and brightest of 
potential students to the school, 
because let's face it: If someone 
from UCSD occupies the White 
House in fony years, that makes all 
our degrees all the shinier. So once 
you identify whether the prospec-
tive student in front of you is either 
a genius or a moron, some tips: 

1. If he or she is considering 
Berkeley, remember to mention 
how our fog is far less pervasive, our 
beaches actually ~n be used for 
swimming and surfing, and that our 
clock tower is actually a Ii brary as 
well. In addition, we do not have any 
scary bums - well, we have a few. 
but they don't tend to rant at passing 
traffic. If, God forbid, they are actu-
ally concerned about academics, do 

not forget to mention how much 
you have enjoyed Humanities, 
MMW or D.O.C. , and reassure 
them, especially if they're science or 
engineering, they'll learn exactly the 
same things from professors who are 
just as renowned, because everyone 
uses the same overpriced textbook 
anyways. The only difference is that 
the curve might be a tad gentler. All 
right, let's face it. A lot gentler. 

2. If the prospective in question is 
considering some fancy liberal arts 
school like Swarthmore, Williams or 
Pomona, mock them mercilessly for 
even considering to spend $40,000 a 
year to get an education that is the 
functional equivalent of a local 
library and a good graduate student 
grading one's papers, both of which 
are present at UCSD. If the prospec-
tive wants a good chance to get into 
graduate school in the sciences or 
medical school, first-rank research is 
imperative, and that is something the 
research budgets of small liberal arts 
schools just ~nnot offer, even if they 
have much, much bener parties and 
richer kids. 

3. if anyone asks about a football 
tcam, a party scene or a sex life, 
deny everything. If they ask about 
drugs, refer them to the nearest 
A.S.-funded media organization.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN nfURSDAY, APRIL IS, 2004 

Discussion section dissection reveals disgusting flaws 
By ROBIN AVERBECK 

Staff Wl:iter 
Universities should always dis-

play concern for the learning experi-
ence of their students. However, not 
all attempts to help students with 
their education are created equally. 
The section meeting required in sev-
eral lower division courses is one 
such enterprise tha r usuall y fai Is to 
be of any use to the serious studen t, 
and its failure is made all the worse 
by its mandatory nature. 

A mandatory section is essentially 
an enforced waste of time. Even if it 
only spans 50 minutes, 10 percent of 
a course grade requires aU the bother 
of attending a lecture - but with few 
rewards. Sections often fail at taking 
the reading or the material to a high-
er level, but actually dumb it down. 

Their intended effect, of course, 
is different. Professor Tracy Strong 
of the political science deparonent 
ees sections as "important because it 

is only in a dialogic context that ... 
self-criticality can be achieved. A lec-
ture will teach you things, but it can-
nOl engage you in dialogue." Indeed, 
if sections refl ected such descrip-
tions, their value would be increased 
considerably. But after enduring 
many long discussion sections, it 
becomes pretty clear to the average 
student that this is rarely the case. 

The unfuirness of a nWldatory 
section is twofold: first, regardless of 
their intent, sections often cater solely 
to students adjusting to college or 
negligent in their studies. Yet, they are 
forced upon everyone. Second, too 
often they compel unwilling and 
unenthusiastic students to reiterate 
basic material. 

Sections are especially needed in 
lower division courses because of class 
size and the typically younger students 
that are enrolled. Although having 
section available to the student adjust-
ing from high school is considerate, it 
should not dominate the lives of older 
undergraduates. Section turns in to a 
questioo-and-answer session for stu-
dents who either haven't adjusted to 

UCSD~ lack of one~n-one interac-
tion, or missed lecture and haven't 
done the reading. Yet some sections 
require attendance if you want to lreep 
your eye on your grade, whether or 
not you need to hear everything over 
again. There is something to be said 
for weeding people out by nOl enforc-
ing section - if some Students can't 
handle the responsibility of optional 
attendance, or don't care enough 
about the material to want to discuss 
it, then that JUSt means there are more 
spaces for people who do. 

However, students of all years 
should be able to get along just fine 
wi thout section as long as they invest a 

certain level of energy in their cours-
es. Either attending the lectures or 
doing the reading is sufficient on its 
own to make section attendance 
pointless. Why spend 50 nninutes 
rewriting notes you wrote the day 
before? Why listen to a teaching assis-
tant reiterate an author's point when 
the author stated it perfectly fine? 
Although section is useful when a stu-
dent is confused or needs to play 
catch-up, it is cruel to subject others to 
monotonous repetition. 

" A mandatory section is 
essentially an enforced 

waste of time. " 
If discussion sections were more 

than just repetition - perhaps actual, 
engaging discussion - then the 10 
percent of the course grade that 
depends on section attendance would 
be Wlderstandable. That 10 percent 
woul d represent the student's serious-
ness and interest in aCtuaIJy thinking 
and engaging with the course materi-
al. According to Strong, "students are 
adults, make judgments for them-
selves, decide how to allocate their 
time. That is why [sections] COWlt for 

a certain percentage of the grade." If 
section did indeed represent a more 
intricate and thoughtful learning 
experience, such sentiments would be 
wholly justified. But the typical sec-
tion experience falls far short of such 
qualities. The 10 percent of your 
grade that section controls means that 
the serious students who care about 
their grades - and actually do the 
reading and attend lectures - are 
punished by being forced to sit 
through mindless repetition. The stu-
dent that IiIces to skate by can skip out 
on lectures and reading, but use sec-
tion as his personaJ review session -
ruming section IlOI: into an engross-
ing, critical discussion, but a reitera-
tioo of class 111llteriaI. 

The repetitive nature of section 
may even be bearable if the principle 
of student involvement didn't bungle 
it even further. The glorified idea of 
getting Students to actively engage in 
reciprocal learning or getting them 
to think about the material during 
class time almost always results in 
disaster. When a TA asks questions 
that are straightforward and simple, 
they are often met with a stony 
silence that fills the air wi th the reek 
of discomfort and embarrassment. ]t 
isn't dense or uninformed students 
that usually cause this stifling envi-
ronment, but a room full of shy, 
unenthusiastic and, most likely, 

bored students that don't readily pro-
duce an answer. As for the few stu-
dents who do dare to respond, it can 
become somewhat uncomfortable 
when they are the unJy ones respond-
ing. Usually, after a painful 30 sec-
onds or so, someone raises their hand 
or the TA answers the question. The 
latter is a sigh of relief, the former 
makes matter.i worse. Students often 
give a roundabout answer that hits 
some of the points, but isn't exactly 
what the TA was going for. However, 
by this point, the silence has put such 
a gall over the room that the TA is 
going to encourage anything, and 
writes aU responses on the board, no 
matter their relevance. At the end of 
the day, it is not clear what the TA 
originally wanted to emphasize. In 
seeking to avoid embarrassing the 
lone responsive student, the TA has 
chosen encouraging participation 
over clearly elucidating the course 
material. This type of TA always 
means well, but in the end, even the 
linnited usefulness of section is 
reduced by confusion to nearly zero. 

The main crux of the problem is 
that sections attempt to be two things 
at once - a review session and an 
engrossing discussion. It usually fails 
to be the latter, but even if we must 
endure the former, it should be com-
mitted to wholly so at least it can be 
a review session of quality.

TIiURSDAY, APRIL 15, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Kerry discusses proposed $25 
billion financial aid package 
If EMILY INOUYE 

Daily Bruin (U. California-los 
Angeles) 

(V-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -
Democratic presidential candidate 
John Kerry thinks he has the 
answer to making college more 
affordable. 

To achieve this feat, Sen. Kerry 
(D-Mass.) has proposed a 525 bil-
lion financial aid package that 
would go to states and $50 billion 
that would go toward a college tax 
credit program. 

Kerry discussed his proposals 
with student journalists from across 
the country in a conference call on 
April 13 as a part of his campaign to 
reach out to college students. 

Kerry said it is important that 
the federal government look at col-
lege affordability, especially with 
recent numbers suggesting that 
numerous students were unable to 
attend !=Ollege this year because of 
rising tuition costs. 

"Over the last three years, col-
lege tuitions have increased by 
about 28 percent, even after talcing 
inflation into account, " Kerry said. 
"That has meant that ... 220,000 
students were priced out of college 
this year - 220,000 who would 
have gone to college but didn't. " 

Kerry~ recent proposals distrib-
ute the $25 billion among states to 
ease their higher education costs. 

In the tax credit proposal, stu-
dents would receive approximately 
$4,000 in tax credits to help relieve 
the expenses of niition. 

The 2004 Bush re-election 
campaign said Kerry's claims about 
funding for college affordability 
were invalid. 

To refute Kerry's statements, the 
Bush campaign provided statistics 
about the proposed 2005 fiscal bud-
get, in which Pell Grant money will 
be increased by $856 million and 
financial aid money by $4.2 billion. 

Based on the increases to Pell 
Grants, an additional one million 
students would receive money from 

the grant program, which would 
not have to be repaid. 

This means that funds for high-
er education are increasing, · but it 
still might not be enough to make 
college affordable for low-income 
students, some say. 

"More and more students are 
graduating from high school, so the 
number goin~ to college is going 
up," said Sandy Baum, a senior pol-
icy analyst from the College Board. 

" We have a direct choice 
- a choice between 

common sense and failing 
economic policy. " 

- Sen. John ~ (IHIIss,), 
presidenIIII GIndidIte 

"This does not say ho~ many are 
not going to college." 

Kerry'S proposals, which could 
be beneficial for students, could 
also feasibly have minimal impact, 
depending on the manner in which 
money will be allocated, according 
to others. 

"It could potentially help a lot of 
people a little bit, or a little people 
a lot," said Maureen Laffey, presi-
dent of the National Association of 
State Student Grant and Aid 
Programs. "I would have to look at 
the program requirements, but any 
money is good ... just 50 long as it is 
earmarked for needy students. " 

But the money isn't necessarily 
allocated for needy students, as one 
of the grants is directed to the 
states and the other is for college 
tax credit. 

When students who are depen-
dents receive tax credit, their par-
ents or guardians are able to write 
off about $1,500 from their income 
taxes. 

But because the money is deduct-

ed from their expenses instead of 
being granted to them, Baum said, 
tax credits may not make a difference 
for most needy students. 

"The most important thing is to 
put money where students need it 
mest," Baum said. "It is impossible 
to improve the college tax credit 
program in a great way; it will help 
middle-income students." 
. In the conference call, Kerry was 
not specific as to where the funds 
for his proposals would come from, 
mentioning that cuts would possi-
bly be made to service and state aid 
programs, though he reiterated his 
commitment to Pell Grant funding, 
health care and No Child Left 
Behind, an act aimed at ensuring 
quality education for students in 
elementary and secondary schools. 

Kerry's lack of specifics drew 
concern that current programs 
already providing financial aid for 
students would be cut back to fund 
his proposed programs. 

"If he's gong to find that money 
from current programs already out 
there, that is not going to help any-
body," Laffey said . "The bottom line 
is they need more money if they 
want to help low-income students." 

The conference call was a part 
of the College Campus Tour, which 
concludes on April 15. The pur-
pose of the tour is to encourage 
students to vote. 

Kerry also touched on the sub-
jects of Social Security, fiscal 
responsibility and the possibility of 
a draft. He said he would guarantee 
thal Social Security funds would be 
available through the rest of this 
century, and he would ensure that 
there would not be a nnilitary draft 
because he would conduct "more 
sensible foreign policy." 

Kerry emphasized the impor-
tance of the student vote. 

"We have a direct choice - a 
choice between common sense and 
failing econonnic policy," Kerry 
said. "It is a stark choice, and we 
want students to recognize their 
power in deciding."

Davis: Congresswoman 
. discusses testing, research 

continued from page I 
their loans. 

"One problem is that if Congress 
wants to maximize the amount sru-
dents can borrow, the idea is that we 
don't want you to find yourselves in 
over your heads in terms of pay-
ment," Davis said. 

Snldents asked Davis questions 
that included standardized testing 
and the priorities put on research 
in universities. For Sixth College 
sophomore Myles Stone, the area 
of research versus education was 
among the most interesting topics 
discussed at the forum. 

"There's a lot of money going to 
research right now, and r wanted to 
see if there's any chance that we 
could cransfer that money to sru-
dent services," Stone said. 

According to A.S. Director of 
University Relations J ared 
Feldman, an organizer of the event, 
the informal forum permitted the 
students and Davis to achieve a 
greater understanding of today's 
key problems in higher ed ucation. 

"It was a nice and intimate set-
ting that really allowed students to 
interact with their representative 
completely unhindered," Feldman 
said. "We were able to facilitate dis-
cussion to help us understand at the 
federal level the issue in education, 
and for her to understand what's 
going on at the campus leveL" 

ASUCSD will host a similar 
forum on April 23 with State Sen. 
Dede Alpert (D-San Diego). Alpert 
currentl y serves as the chair of the 
joint committee on the master plan 
for educa tion and as the chair for 
the appropriations committee in 
the California Senate. 

At the dinner held after the 
forum, Davis spoke about how sru-
dent organizations can improve 
communication wi th one another. 
T hose who attended the dinner 

included representatives from 
Interpraise Christian Council, the 
Coalition for South Asian People, 
the Armenian Srudent Association 
and Srudents for Democracy and 
Peace. 

Davis spoke about the difficul-
ties of crying to work with people 
with differing viewpoints. She cited 
experience working with people in 
different political parties and how 
activities such as craveling to Iraq 
and AfghaniSTan have allowed her 
and other members of Congress to 
share a common experience. Davis 
suggested planning an event 
together in order to create more 
interaction with one another. 

"1 think it's a lot of hard work and 
it takes a lot of relationship build-
ing," Davis sa id. "Try and plan 
together something to go see, an 
issue that you can visually encounter 
together with the same eyes, at the 
same time, hearing the same things." 

Participating students expressed 
interest in coordinating such an 
event that would bring together the 
different student organizations. 
Some sugge ted holding a film 
series that would showcase the cul-
rural backgrounds of the organiza-
tions. 

According to San Diego Israel 
Alliance President Diane Meslcin, 
the event allowed her to get to 
know srudents from the other orga-
ni zations. Meskin said that the 
event gave participants the oppor-
tunity to share ideas about main-
taining an organization and advice 
on retention and programming. 

"I'm really happy with how [the 
event) went," Meskin said. "It 
seemed like the event was really 
well-received all around, and a lot 
of the participants thanked us for 
including them, expressing that 
they hope to work with us in the 
future ."

depending on surf conditions. 

According to San Diego Fire-

the strong current could have

Fox: Regents increase chancellor's salary 
continued from page I 

Fox, 56, has been at NCSU's 
helm since 1998, previously serving 

. as vice president for research at the 
University of Texas, Austin. Among 
many awards and positions, she is 
an elected member of the National 
Academy of Sciences and currently 
serves on President George W 
Bush's Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology. Born in 
Ohio, Fox earned her undergradu-
ate degree from Nocre Dame 
College and her doctorate from 
Daronouth College, both in chem-
iscry, a nd has received honorary 
degrees from universities in the 
United States and abroad. 

"It is my view .. . that every-
thing she has done to this day has 
led her to UCSD," Dynes said. 

While the decision to appoint 
Fox was unanimous, fixing her 
salary level was not. Two Regents 
opposed granting Fox a $350,000 
annual salary - nearly 25 percent 
more than the salary earned by 
Dynes as chancellor - plus a relo-
cation allowance of $87,500. 

Srudent Regent Matt Murray, 
who voted against· the salary hike, 
said he understood the university 
faced "enormous external pres-
sure" to stay competitive and 
increase salaries of senior adminis-
trators, which currently lag 
behind those at comparable uni -
versities across the nation. 

"I believe that in a terrible bud-
get time like the one we are facing 
with student fee increases, enroll-
ment cuts, no cost-of-living adjust-
ment or salary increases for faculty 
and staff ... there need to be voices 
pushing bacL: against that pres-
sure," Murray said. "I don't blame 
the people at UC for this problem; 
it is a larger national trend in acad-
elnia, but I do think it is important 
to resist it as much as possible." 

Fox, following in Dynes' foot-
steps, will set up an on-campus 
laboratory for her own research . 
This, she said, will likely be with 
the help of her husband, also a 
chemist, who has already started 
the application process for joining 
the UCSD faculty. 

One tradition that Fox hinted 
she might not be able to uphold 
was Dynes' regular runs around 
campus. 

"I'm a real believer in fitness, 
although you wouldn't believe it 
looking at me .. . but this is one of 
the places where I will not be in 
competition with my predeces-
sor," Fox said. 

WIov "-ow/GwrtJan 
PIs5in& the torch: UC President Robert C Dynes announces his successor as 
UCSD chancellor. Marye Anne Fox will take office on Aug. 16. 

Fox outlined what she hoped 
she would do for UCSD in a 
speech to administrators and gath-
ered press. 

"My vision for UCSD is one of 
interdisciplinary, innovative and 
international excellence," she said. 
"It requires a passionate commit-
ment to the ideal of scholarly 
achievement as a public trust. It 
recognizes the global nature of 
intellecrual frontiers in the sci-
ences and engineering, as well as 
in the arts, humanities, social sci-
ences and medicine." 

Fox also touched upon the 
accessibility and diversity of 
UCSD. 

"In the face of current budget 
challenges and proposed enroll-
ment cuts, we must redouble our 
efforts to ensure that these sru-
dents are drawn from all parts of 
the state and all segments of soci-
ety," she said. "The circle of 
opporrunity must be as wide as it 
is diverse, but entrance to it must 
be objective and transparent and 
must include the entire range of 
these diverse skill sets brought by 
the amazing srudents who seek to 
attend this university." 

Fox said that UCSD has "not 
come even close" to fully integrat-
ing alumni into the role of the uni-
versity, and that she would worlc to 
do so. 

She also scressed closer collab-
oration with business and indus-
crial partners, "with safeguards in 
place to protect against con flict of 
interest." Fox advocated the blur-
ring of boundaries between the 
university and the local communi-
ty with the help of private sector 

partners to achieve projects like 
Preuss School or the Homeland 
Security Initiative. 

After her speech, which was 
broadcasted throughout 
California by teleconference, Fox 
fielded questions from news 
media. 

In response to questions about 
the role of research, Fox said that 
research was a "primary love" of 
hers as she continues to publish. 

"I believe that the process of 
discovery is the most stimulating 
thing that any srudenr or faculty 
member could possibly do," she 
said. "So the possibility of incor-
porating research as a key part of 
an undergraduate education as 
well as a graduate education is 
going to be one thing that llook at 
very carefully." 

To the question of her outlook 
on athletics, Fox responded that 
while she believes that having 
opportunities ' for intercollegiate 
competitions is very important for 
students, "that doesn't mean you 
have to be in Division I necessarily." 

Srudent representatives to the 
selection committee said they 
believe that Fox, who has won 
teaching and mentoring awards, 
will serve UCSD students well. 

"I think Marye Anne Fox has a 
tremendous understanding of the 
students at a research university," 
said Eric Frechette, Graduate 
Srudent Association president and 
a member of the search advisory 
committee. "She's got a passion 
for research; she knows even down 
to· the detail the programs that 
students care about ... so she'll be 
really perfect for UCSD."

you go into class and not walk in 
certain areas and watch what you 
sayan the third floor [of Price 
Center]," Maull said. "I just felt 
that while we have to watch our-
selves so closely for two weeks, 
elected officials are not held to the 
same standard and I think that's 
inherently unfair." 

A press release sent by 
Srudents First! supporters on 
April 9 stated that the legislation 
was not aimed at Pae's campaign. 
However, Gallagher said that the 
resolution was a direct attack 
against his character. 

"I scrongly believe that people 
are looking for someone to blame 
for [the I outcome of the election, 
and I am being unfairly targeted," 
Gallagher said. "I did next to 
nothing in this election besides 
send out a single e-mail on 
Thursday of second week." 

According to both Gallagher 
and proponents of the resolution, 
Gallagher'S e-mai l encouraged 
srudenrs to vote in the runoff elec-
tion . The text also included "I am 
voting for Jenn Pae for president" 
and encouraged recipients to ask 
Gallagher about his choice. 
Finally, Gallagher signed the e-
mail with his title as A.S. presi-
dent. 

"I think clearly, in advocating 
for Jenn Pae, he becomes her 
agent," Maull said. "I think that 
that e-mail is an example of an 
active campaign on her [behal~." 

The resolution alleges that 
Gallagher's endorsement of Pae 
"violated the spirit of ASUCSD's 
objectivity and noninterference in 
elections. " 

"I do not feel that by sending 
an e-mail with my name and title 
stating who 1 voted for was in any-
way unethical," GalJa,gher said. "I 
did not slander anyone, nor did I 
even directly advocate for one 
candidate or another." 

After ex~nsive debate by 
council members on the A.S. 
Council listserv, it became appar-
ent even before the meeting that 
the resolution would not be con-
sidered. 

"I think [the resolution) is · 
immarure and ridiculous," said 

Re~e1le College Sophomore 
Senator Ashley Aluisi. 

Revelle College Senior 
Senator-elect Ted McCombs, who 
ran with Srudents First!, spoke to 
the council during public input. 

"This action was not in any 
way motivated by malice," 
McCombs said. "This bill was 
never meant as a personal arrack 
against President Gallagher, and if 

you suspect or feel otherwise, you 
should certainly vote it down." 

Even with the short debate on 
the council floor, Maull expressed 
satisfaction with the discussion 
the resolution produced. 

"I think what is important 
from this situation is to take the 
good parts of the debate that we 
had and use them constructively 
in discussing bylaw changes so 
that it's not just changing the 
bylaws for the sake of changing ' 
the bylaws, but changing the 
bylaws so that it means some-
thing," Maull said. 

Maull plans to submit elec-
tions bylaw changes for the 
council's April 21 meeting that 
would remove the stipulation 
that candidates cannot use A.S. 
offices and resources to advocate 
for a candidate or slate. The 
changes would also allow candi-
dates to actively campaign in 
classrooms. 

"I think that A.S. needs to take 
a stand one way or the other in 
saying that this is unethical or say-
ing that he's allowed to do this," 
Maull said. "And if he's allowed to 
do it, we need to clean up the elec-
tions bylaws so that the account-
ability is equal, so that candidates 
and elected officials are held to 
the same stand.rd."

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Punisher' reveals his secrets 
Tom Jane discusses training and stabbing mishap 

By ANNA DYLEWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

With his handsome, rugged, everyman features, Tom Jane looks like a movie star. 
Yet beyond the appearance lies a 
pleasant demeanor that seems 
always to be lost in a profound 
train of thought. He even appears 
pensive while he slowly drags on 
his cigarette. Jane has starred in 
such eclectic films as "The 
Sweetest Thing," "61.," 
"Magnolia," "The Thin Red 
Line," and most recently "The 
Punisher." His latest action-
packed release is about a man's 
redemption as he strives to avenge 
the murder of his family and his 
ultim":te discovery that his 
strength and agility can be used 
for honorable means. Jane con-
templated a few questions about 
the film and related maners. 

Guardian: How do you usually 
choo e your roles? 

Tom Jane: I look for two 
things. [look for two diametrically 
oppo ed, yet equal, forces that exist 
within the character, and then how 
they consolidate themselves, or 
work themselves out, and what hap-
pens to the person as these twO 
forces are rubbing up inside them. 
That is key for me as an actor. With 
Mantle [lTom "610 " ), it's this amaz-
ing self-destructive streak coupled 
with this incredible ability to per-
form athletically. Neal Cassady 
[lTom "The Last Time I 
Commined Suicide") is living on 
the absolute outer boWldaries of 
society, and yet, all Cassady ever 
wanted [was) a wife and two kids, a 
picket fence and a house - that's 
his ultimate dream. Frank Castle 
[lTom "The Punisher"l - the law-
man, the special forces operative, 
the believer in America, the 
upholder of the law, the believer of 
justice - had the ultimate injusticc 
done to him and had all of those 
things stripped away, and how does 
he reconcile those two diametrical -
ly opposed forces, wanting to do 
the right thing and yet wanting also 
to kill them all? 

G: You did 90 percent of th~ 
stunts [in "The Punisher"). How 
long did it take you to learn how 
to do all of that? 

'I): [ had six months to prep for 
the film anJ in that way [ trained 

with the [Navy) Seals. That allowed 
me the skills and the confidence to 
be able to do that, and it was impor-
rant for me to do that going in. As 
much as I was intluenced by Lee 
Marvin, [Charles] Bronson and 
hard nosed 70s' characters, I was 
also influenced by Buster Keaton 
and Charlie Chaplin, who brought 
a great sense of humor to their 
work and a real human three-
dimensional, emotional sense of 
pathos and just a fantastic versatili-
ty in tenns of the physicality of 
their roles. [It] was very strong, [ 
mean, their roles were purely phys-
ical because they were operating in 
the silent medium, so I wanted to 
do "The Punisher" and tum him 
into a purely physical presence and 
speak as little as possible and try to 
tell the story with my actions. 
That's challenging and it's some-

" It's not a good day when you smb your co,star, 
and it was not my 

proudest moment. But 
[the injury] wasn't bad, 
ju.st a flesh wound ... JJ 

thing [ really am very fascinated by. 
It's just something that I've always 
loved. 

G: Were there any unforeseen 
problems that occurred during the 
shooting? 

TJ: Well, yeah, there were some 
troubles. It's inevi table in this kind 
of film. I kind of prepared for it like 
a professional sport. I fortunately 
came through it relatively 
Wlscathed. I stabbed my co-star 
Kevin Nash. I forgot to change out 
the real knife for the prop knife and 
when I went to stab him [during the 
shoot], it was a real knife. But he 
took it like a gentleman. It's not a 
good day when you stab your ca-
star, and it was not my proudest 
moment. But [the injury] wasn't 
bad, it was just a flesh wound and 
we went on with our day, but it did-
n't feel good. It felt terrible. 

G: Speaking of [professional 
wrestler] Kevin Nash, what was it 

Film 
INTERVIEW 

like going up against him in that 
one scene? 

'I) : We knew that we were mak-
ing an imprCSliion with our size dif-
ference and we use it to our advan-
tage. That fight scene is very much 
influenced by theJames Bond fight 
scenes. There's a great scene with 
Robert Shaw and Sean Connery. 
Tqose are the influences. Those 
fight scenes where they could be 
hardnosed and they could be bare-
knuckle, knockdown, drag-out 
fights , but have a sense of humor to 
them. We just had fun, and I think 
it's a memorable scene. I think it's a 
scene that, well already it's a scene 
that everybody's talking about, and 
[ hope they continue to talk about it 
for a long time because we had a lot 
of fun making that happen. And it's 
due to Kevin's [professionalism] 
and his abilities and his athleticism 
that we were able to do a lot of what 
we did, so it really worked out well. 

G: Do you have any more roles 
coming out as cool as "The 
Punisher?" 

TJ: I played a preny cool part 
last summer. I played a guy, a 
South AlTican policeman during 
the 1976 apartheid. He's living 
under the regime where he is 
asked by his government to kill 
people during these riots and he 
deals with that by robbing banks 
during his lunch hour. It was a 
true story about a real guy who 
lived named Andre . Stander. The 
film is called "Stander." It comes 
out June 11. Bob Berney [presi-
dent of . distribution] at 
Newmarket who did "The Passion 
of the Christ" and "Monster" 
picked up the film and I'm really 
proud to be a part of [it). It's a ter-
rific story, it's an action mama, it's 
an anti-hero, [and) it subverts the 
genre in a way. It's another guy 
who has diametrically opposed 
forces operating inside of him. 

You can see Tom Jane in action 
as the Punisher on April 16. Also, 
look for his other film, "Stander," 
in theaters on June II . Shooting 
for the sequel to the "The 
Punisher" could begin as early as 
November 2004.

New tour returns punk 
rock to political arena 

Alkaline Trio, others sing out against Bush and 
encourage new voters on Punk Voter tour 

By IAN S. POII' 
Staff Writer 

With nothing but a snarling voice and a hell of a reputa-tion behind him, punk icon 
J ella Biafra addressed the crowd: 
"No one has disrespected the 
innocent people that died on 
September 11 and pissed on their 
graves more than George W. 
Bush!" 

He then referenced the recent 
ambush and subsequent killing of 
four American civilians in Iraq, 
adding, "Look no farther than the 
charred bodies on the bridge." 

Biafra's enraged speech was 
delivered to a crowded RIMAC 
Arena between performances by 
NOFX, Alkaline Trio. and 
Authority Zero, all part of a tour 
aimed at mobilizing young voters 
against the current administra-
tion. 

"The idea behind [the tour) is 
to try and register 500,000 new 
voters, prefera bly voting against 
the Bush administration. The 
tour's called Rock Against Bush, 
it's a political tour, and we want 
new voters," said Man Skiba, 
vocalist and guitarist for popular 
emo-punk band Alkaline Trio. 
"We want to get young fan~ to 
realize how important it is for 
them to go vote. " 

The Rock Against Bush tour, 
which now includes over 11 bands 
and concert dates all over the 
country, marks a.new direction for 
mainstream punk. which has for 
soine time stayed away from the 

political fury of its past. Bands like 
Alkaline Trio, known more for 
wearing heartbreak on their 
sleeves than waging poJitical wars, 
seem more than happy to support 
the cause. 

"This is the first time we've 
done something regarding nation-
al politics," Skiba said. "We go out 
and tour anyway, and to be able to 
use that toward something that we 
feel is a good cause is a great,feel-
ing. It's a win-win situation for 
us." 

Headlining the tour's UCSO 
appearance were NOFX, who have 
enjoyed a successful career mixing 
loud music with self-deprecating 
humor, an approach that singer Fat 
Mike lent to his new political ambi-
tions. "It's stupid against stupider," 
he said to the crowd, implicating 
himself as the former and pointing 
to a large caricature of President 
Bush as the laner. 

But behind Fat Mike's juvenile 
humor is a dedication to politics 
that punk rock has not seen in a 
long time. His record label, Fat 
Wreck Chords, started the Punk 
Voter organization, 'which, along 
with starting the tour, ' created its 
own Web site (http://www.punlrvot-
""rom), where usen can read politi-
cal articles, download voter regis-
tration applications and donate to 
the cause. The label will release the 
first in a series of Rock Apinst 
Bush compilation CDs Apnl 20, 
featuring bands perfocming on the 
tour.

acts with a new approach to popular music. 
Leading this recent surge is a well-dressed 
quartet ITom Glasgow, Scad and by the 
name of Franz Ferdinand. On their self-
titled debut, Franz Ferdinand put out a 
sound that lies somewhere between 1980s 
rock and dance music. 

Armed with dirty guitars and pulsating 
rhythms, the boys are able to put out a 
rocking sound that is appropriately con-
trasted by Alex Kapranos' poetic and intro-
spective lyrics. Starting off with the melan-
cholic "Jaqueline," Kapranos writes about 
the monotony of work and how it's "always 
better on holiday." 

As the album progresses, Ferdinand 
reach their songwriting peak on the single 

Fans of the Neptunes will be slightly dis-appointed at first listen of their alter ego NO~OR·D's (the group also 
includes Shay, along with Pharrell Wtllianis 
and Chad Hugo) new album Fly ()/" Die. The 
signature sound of a Neptunes production 
that can be heard on almost any radio sta-
tion is nowhere to be found here. 

On this album, the trio decided to take 
on the task of playing all the instruments on 
the album themselves. This makes for some 
sloppy sounding tracks, but a t times allows 
for the group to get feeling not only out of 
lyrics (all sung by Pharell) but also the 
beats. 

New England-bred Mark Erdli has Tens in his blood. His fourth release, HilJbiUy Pilgrim, exemplifies his 
Americana country roots sound. Produced 
With Boston's Spurs, Erelli drops an album 
rich in full Western swing, a change imper-
ceptible to anyone outside of the country 
music scene. Investing his time into rein-
carnating the spirits of Lyle Lovett and 
Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Erelli writes songs 
with the same full-hearted 1930s and '4Os 
Western twang and classic folk lyrics. 

Hillbilly Pilgrim is coated with clever 
country wordplay and vivid Midwestern sen-
sibility. With lyrics such as "I hear a tickII 
hear a tock/Must be your biological clock" in 

. 

reviews 
All reviews ire out of five Stln. 

"Take Me Out." With unorthodOl[ tempo 
changes and catchy, overdriven guitars, 
Franz Ferdinand perfect their dancy, art-
rock sound and leave the listener singing 
and tapping to the music long aher the 
song has ended. Although Ferdinand fail to 
stray hom up-tempo dance tunes, they do 
each song so well and with such originality, 
that the album closes with no regret or 
desire for the boys to explore different 
styles. 

Maybe naming the band after the 
moniker of the archduke whose assassina-
tion kicked off World War I is more 
prophetic than arrogant. Only time will 
tell, but if nothing else, Franz Ferdinand 
have made a record that lives up to the hype 
that has been surrounding them for the past 
year. 

- Jesse Kivel 
StIlff Writtr 

Top to bonom, the album provides solid 
tracks, except for their terrible decision to 
include Good Charlotte on "Jump." 
However, the album is able to cover numer-
ous topics and still get you to bob your head 
to it, whether it be war, stardom, punish-
ments or women. 

N"E"R"O were able to avoid the sopho-
more slump many 'artists fall into. Their 
first album is slightly bener than this one, 
mainly ITom the art instrumentation stand-
point, but Ply ()/" Die is a good buy nonethe-
less. 

- TIm Spulecld 
Smi()/" Staff Writer 

the song "Let's Make a Family," Erelli infus-
es the album with a light-hearted humor. In 
'songs like "A Bend in the River," binersweet 
stories about watching the small town you 
grew up in being flooded invokes the country 
music tone of nostalgia. 

Sticking to classic country acoustic gui-
tar and accompanied by country peers on 
everything from violins to cowbells, 
HillbiUy Pilgrim is a modern classic remake 
of country music that is a step away from 
taclcy pop country.

'Kill Bill' will slay action buffs 
Second volume of epic is cheesy and enthralling 
By EVAN McLAUGHUN 

Senior Staff Writer 

What a difference an ending makes. Or does the ending even ma tter? 
The second installment of the 

"Kill Bill" epic is markedly better 
than the first, but not because the 
the Bride (Uma TImnnan) squares 
off with her ex-boss Bill (David 
Carradine, "Kung Fun TV series) 
in a fight to the death. "Vol. I" con-
vinces the audience of its coolness 
on overwhelming fight choreogra-
phy and Tarantino name-brand 
appeal alone. The plot appears 
alluring, and the visuals - the 
bombshells, art design and sword-
play alike - were enough reason to 
pay admissi.on for the first. 

"Vol. 2" actually unearths the 
Bride's motivations for her pas-
sionate vengeance, while showcas-
ing the dialogue, storyline jumps 
and character development that 
make Quentin Tarantino such a 

special filmmaker, but were large-
Iyabsent from the first volume. 

The story thus far has the 
Bride recovering from a gunshot 
to the head at the hand of Bill -
the boss of the Deadly Vipers 
Assassination Squad and, as we 
learn, the father of her now-four-
year-old daughter - and seeking 
revenge upon all five of her for-
mer cohorts in the squad. In "Vol. 
1" The Bride traveled to suburban 
Los Angeles and Tokyo to dispose 
of Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu, 
respectively. "Vol. 2" documents 
her sea rch in the WIld West for 
Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle 
Driver (Daryl Hannah) and, final -
ly, Bill . 

The characters are better 
described in "Vol. 2,» as the audi-
ence sees Bill being equally 
charming and soft-spoken as he is 
ruthless. Carradine, credited with 
more than 100 film and TV roles, 
describes his role as being the best 
of his career and the film as being

Film 
REVIEW 

the best production he's ever been 
a part of. 

Along the way in "Vol. 2", 
Tarantino treats moviegoers to a 
25-minute tangent on The Bride's 
training under Pei Mei - the 
Chinese martial arts master with 
cotton candy eyebrows who holds 
the secret of the Five-Point Palm 
Exploding Heart Technique - and 
the wisdom/abuse he bestows upon 
her. The absurdity of the Bride's 
arrival at Bill's lair - she's ready to 
engage in cold-heaned combat, and 
then shifts gears on the spot to play 
Mommy when she discovers her 
daughter playing with Daddy Bill 
- is so surreal: Playtime with the 
four-year-old is a successful buffer 
betwee_n the Bride's vengl!ance, 
being in a coma, tied up and buried 
alive in a wooden casket, attacked 
by 100 ninja warriors and shot three 
times phase her quest. 

The film 's moral - that the 
scores of deaths throughout the 
plot are justified if it means a 
mother can be with the daughter 
she's never met - is cheesy, but 
experiencing volumes one and two 
are a must for any action/adven-
ture movie buff. The "Kill Bill" 
epic has the romantic elements of 
a Western in the vein of Sc!tgio 
Leone or John Ford combined 
with all the stoicism and finesse of 
a Shaw Brothers kung-fu film, 
paying homage and satirizing the 
good,. the bad and the ugly of each 
genre in the styling of Tatantino. 

For those alle rgic to gory 
images like toes squishing an eye-
ball, don't waste you r time or 
lunch on th.is over-the-top kung-
fu flick. To everyone else, get in 
line: The Bride is kicking ass and 
taking names later.

Not just a big fat drag show

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

N ia Vardalos, the writer and star of the wildly successful 
"My Big Fat Greek 
Wedding," is back with the 

new movie "Connie and Carla.» 
Also wri tten by and staring 

Vardalos, "Connie and Carla" is 
the predicable yet funny story of 
best friends Connie (Vardalos) and 
Carla (Toni Collette) who are try-

ing their best to make their way 
into the entertainment world . 
Their plans stan to go awry when 
they witness a gangster murder 
someone and they have to leave 
Chicago. 

Trying to avoid being found, 
they decide to go to the last place 
anyone would ever look for them, 
a place with no culture, Los 
Angeles. Once there, the only 
way they can affor.d to get by is to 
perform as drag queens.

REVIEW 

Everything goes well for a while 
until Connie falls for Jeff (David 
Duchovny), the brother of 
Robert/Peaches (Stephen 
Spinella), one of the other drag 
queens in the show. 

Overall the movie is charming 
and witty, very much in the style of 
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding"; yet 
it does not feel like a cheap copy of 
the previous movie. The jokes are 
original and delivered with won-
derful comedic timing. 

The beginning and the end of 
the movie are the two weakest 
points . They are much too predi-
cable and drag (no pun intended) 
considerably in comparison to the 
rest of the movie, which moves 
rather quickly and keeps the jokes 
coming as fast as the audience can 
take them. 

The characters in the movie 
are' wonderfully presented

Perhaps the greatest ironies of both the film "Dogville," which decries arrogance as 
the most contemptible of 

human traits, and its enfant terri-
ble director, Lars Von Trier, are 
their shared propensities for pom-
posity and bravado. Von Trier, a 
Danish-Catholk filmmaker noto-
rious for his "vow of chastity," 
shuns the superficial glamour of 
Hollywood production. 

It is not in this regard, but 
rather in the message that piggy-
backs upon Von Trier's grand,

Kidman's restrained perfonnance. 

Where the quality of Kidman's 
acting ends is where Von Trier picks 
up. Fitting the drama into the con-
fines of a SOWldstage decorated min-
imally with half-built sets and chalk 
outlines in place of physical objects 
(for example, dogs and mulberry 
bushes), Von Trier reduces the set-
ting and focuses on the dramatic 
interactions between characters,

up. 

While it is 
rebellious of Von 
Trier to evoke 
the tone, envi-
ronment and 
medium of a 
playhouse, it rais-
es ~e question of 
whether or not 
the cinema is 
merely just the-
ater on film, 

Ii is a film that is 
excessively blunt

However, to nit-
pick over its social 
didacticisms and 
ou ts poken ness 
would be to miss the 
point - the great-
ness of the film can 
be traced not in 
what it says but 
more simply in what 
it is. 

The film is a 
rather straightfor-
ward narrative fol-
lowing Grace 
(Nicole Kidman), a 
disillusioned urban-
ite fleeing from 

comedy and 
meanings I so much 
so that one would 

be rightly wary and 
confused enough to 

check his or her 
laughter and see if 

anyone else is 
laughing. " 

The biggest 
mistake in under-
standing 
"Dogville" is try-
ing to find a signif-
icant message. 
Instead, it is a film 
of extravagant ges- . 
tures, histrionic 
dilemma and sear-
ing black comedy. 
It is a film that is 

mobsters, who finds a reluctant 
acceptance and later a chilling 
malevolence in the small township 
of Dogville. The film, more or 
less, is a direct allegory of how 
spontaneously goodwill can sour. 

~ndly and willingly, Grace 
subjects herself to the piecemeal 
labor required as a test to prove 
her true character to the locals. 
And even when the town wholly 
conspires against her and her tasks 
grow wildly ridiculous and 
demanding, she holds true to her 
namesake, barely resisting the 
dehumanizing assaults on her 
merciful spirit in the Von Trier 
melodramatic tradition 
("Breaking the Waves: "Dancer 
in the Dark,,). 

Here, Kidmab is suited for the 
ro.Ie. · With her ' glowing, cbarining 
demeanor showing the ever-widen-
ing fractures of her trapdy and 
sadness with each new harm, much 

excessively blunt 
and rough in its 

comedy and meanings, so much so 
that one would be rightly wary and 
confused enough to check his or her 
laughter and see if anyone else is 
laughing. 

After Dogville's brutal and vio-
lent conclusion, the end credits are 
paired with portraits of suffering 
Americana scored to David Bowie's 
pop-inclined "Young Americans." 
Von Trier's sardonic humor 
resounds, showing that he has 
made a reckless and bold film that 
is unafraid of going "too far," a trait 
that is a rarity in cinema. 

THURSDAY, APRil IS, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 13 

Mark -Erelli arriv~s with a tried-and-true brand of country 
Influenced by the old-school western swing of Lyle Lovett, Erelli's throwback country is a breath of fresh air 

ByANNSHEN 
Staff Writer 

Anyone looking for a little bit of country in San Diego need look no further than Mark 
Erelli, who comes to town on April 
15 armed with guitar and twang. 

While attending graduate school, 
New 'England-bred Erelli first 
made his debut onto the country 
folk-rock scene at the age of 24, 
rocking at 3 a.m. at an impromptu 
music conference showcase in a 
hotel room. 

He released his first record in 
1999, a self-titled debut on 
Signature Sounds, which earned 
him a prestigious Kerrville New 
Folk award, the first of a string of 
awards and respect he would garner 
in the next four years. 

His second album, Compass 0-
Companion, was released in 2001 
- featuring collaborative work 
with classic country folk musicians 

Iik~ Kelly Willis on the title track 
- and landed him on tour with 
the likes of Dave Alvin , John 
Hiatt, Nanci Griffith and Gillian 
Welch. The album was nominated 
for two Boston Music Awards, 

spent nine weeks on the Top Ten 
Americana charts, and established 
Erelli as a formidable country 
roots musician. 

Tbe Memorial Hall Recordings 
marked a different path in Erelli's 
course of music. He returned to his 
New England roots and produced 
an ambitious album with a New 
England theme. FuJI of originals, 
covers, and new arrangements of 
songs, the daring release showed 
Erelli's true talent for country 
music, and his ability to reinvent 
and still tie his work to the 
thoughtfulness of classic folk. 

Now at 29, Erelli is on tour in 
support of his fourth album 
Hillbilly Pilgrim, a collection influ-
enced and infused with the sounds 
of 1930s and '4Os western swing. 
Straying from the stronger 
Americana-tinged folk and blues 
of his previous three albulUs, this 
album is filled with the influences 
of Lyle Lovett and Jimmie Dale 
Gilmore. Produced with the help 
of Boston's Spurs, HiJJbilly Pilgrim 
has been met with much accep-
tance and revelry in the country 
crowd.

album that was more country was 
a conscious choice. 

"I've always played hyphenated

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, APRIL IS , 2004 

Digitalization is double-edged sword for albums 
The music industry would do well to follow Wileo's lead 

are 
Clayton Worfolk 

Forget for a minute the hun-dreds of kids sued by the Recording Industry 
Association of America. Forget the 
music retailers filing for bankrupt-
cy and the major labels' slumping 
sales, Forget Shawn Fanning, 
Metallica and the 520 record. 
When the last battle over the digi-
talization of music is over, there 
will likely be only one casualty of 
real concern: the album. 

For all the benefits of the 
online file sharing revolution, it 
has proven what label execs have 
hoped since the birth of the pop 
music industry: that the majority 
of music (onsumers - and I use the 
word with maximum pretension 
- are in it for the quick fix of a 
single. Right on, says I - fans of 
your Timberlakes, Simpsons and 
Aikens should be able to down-
load their favorite singers' new 
Neptunes-produced hit instead of 
shelling out S 17 .99 for an other-
wise shitty album or waiting for 
NtnJ! Thllt's What 1 Call Mus;c 16. 
But when the music industry tries 
to apply this brand of con-
sumerism to the cohesive records 
of actual musicians, everyone 
loses. 

"I think 'With a Little Help 
From My Friends' is cute, but I'll 
pass on 'A Day in the Life.'" No. 
Real musicians deserve bener than 
the 99-cent-per-track downloads 
offered by industry-sponsored, oh-
so-legal endeavors like iTunes and 
Rhapsody. Such services delegit-
imize artists' efforts to make a 
musical statement and strip them of 
artistic freedoms, like crafting 
multi-track medleys, experiment-
ing with concepts, or simply 
recording 20 minutes of feedback. 
Whats more, real fans - who I 
might add are IIlwllJs sure to down-

who banlaoll the music industry 
with Britney purchases. Sure, we all 
like options - but I would no 
sooner fuck with LtmJon CalJing 
than I would abridge "On the 
Road" or cut "The Graduate." 

The industry would. In the 
one-dollar, one-vote world of 
sales, luring illegal peer-to-peer 
traders of Usher's "Burn" above 
ground is more important than 
preserving Yoshimi Battle! the Pink 
Robots. And as underground out-
lets for file sharing go under and 
pay-for online stores win a larger 
share of total sales, more and 
more artists and fans may be 
forced to subscribe to this new 
iPod-ready order - or opt out of 
the pop music market entirely. 
Unless ... . 

There is another edge to the 
digital sword. The Internet fosters 

" Real musicians deserve better than the 99 .. cent .. 
per .. track downloads 
offered by industry .. 

sponsored I oh .. so--legal 
endeavors like {limes and 

Rhapsody, 1/ 
infinite opportunities for artists to 
begin to communicate directly 
with fans - opportunities to build 
relationships that ensure a place 
for challenging, innovative or 
simply unpopular music. If this 
scares the industry shitless, it 
should. 

Mter A Ghost ;s Born, the forth-
coming album by perennial 
groundbreakers Wiko, leaked 
online last month, the band 
responded in a novel and all too 
uncommon way - it not only 
posted the album's track listing, 
liner notes and album art on its 
Web site, 
hup:II7J)'WW.7J);/co7J)orld.ntt, but 
made available the entire reco'rd 
- due out in months - for stream-
ing download. What's more, fans 

have responded not by taking the 
tracks and running, as the industry 
has long characterized file sharers 
of doing, but by donating thou-
sands of dollars to Doctors 
Without BQrders, a charity group 
championed by Wilco, through 
the fan site bnp:lfunvwjustllfon.org. 
As of April 12, the site has raised 
S7,322 in what it calls a "symbolic 
down payment ... and a show of 
thanlcs to the band for its continu-
ing generosity and trust." 

This is not the first time Wilco 
and its fans have bucked industry 
misconceptions. In 2002, the band 
streamed its unconventionally bril-
liant }'tmkee Hotel Foxtrot online fol-
lowing former label Reprise 
Records' refusal to release it. When 
the record was finally released on 
new label Nonesuch just short of a 
year later, fans - gasp! - bought 
the album in support of the artists 
they respected . It debuted at No. 
13 on the Billboard chans, a band 
high. 

The fact that frontman Jeff 
Tweedy is among the most 
esteemeilliving rock musicians -
or that A Ghost ;s Born could quite 
possibly be Wilco's best release 
ever - will certainly playa role in 
fans' decision to purchase the 
album when it comes out on June 
22. Nonetheless, the industry can 
learn a lesson from the band's 
connection with its fans. Music 
cannot be confined by the busi-
ness conventions of common 
commodities; the consumer is not 
always right in this reciprocal 
relationship. Musicians, by and 
large, make music because they 
love doing so. Fans, in turn, listen 
to music for the same reason and 
support artists they respect by 
choosing to pay for what the 
musicians themselves choose to 
offer. Building and maintaining 
these relationships - not market-
ing the quick-buck song - is the 
most effective way to guarantee 
sales in the long run - for 
Britney Spears and Wilco, alike. 

I downloaded A Ghost is Born 
on Soulseek last week. My "peer" 
messaged me within seconds: "Be 
sure to buy the album onJune 22 ." 
No pitch could have been more 
persuasive .

Connie: Vardalos' latest film 
avoids 'Big Fat Greek' humor 

continued from page I 2 
multi-dimensional where it would 
have been tempting just to add a 
stock character for comic relief. 
The issue of drag was also handled 
carefully and seriously despite its 
use for comedic purposes. 

Throughout the movie, there 
are wonderful song and dance 
numbers from various musicals 
from "Evita" to "Grease" and even 
"The Roclcy Horror Picture 
Show." There is even a cameo by 
Debbie Reynolds who joins 
Connie, Carla and the other drag 
queens for a few numbers at the 
end of the movie. However, only 

about 30 seconds of any song are 
presented, so even those who do 
not care for musical theatre will not 
be bored or irritated. . 

Overall, this is a good movie if 
you are in the mood for Iightheaned 
comedy, perfect for a date or even 
just a night out with some friends.

Baldwin: UCSD~produced 
plays feature relatable stories 

continued from page I 0 
result? Top-notch, quality plays. 

BNPF has much to show its 
audience, not only through raw tal-
ent and ingenuity, but also through 
the time and effon spent toward 
development. And as the story goes, 
over 12 months of writing, editing, 
submitting, casting, re-writing, dec-
orating, more writing, tweaking, un-
tweaking and rehearsing have been 
put forth to produce the final prod-
ucts that you will see at BNPF. Plus, 
it is the MFA students' "project of 
the year" and with the measureless 
amounts of effort and time put in, 
you can only expect production of 
the highest caliber. 

These UCSD plays are produced 
nationwide, and many are evenruaUy 
showcased in big theater-savvy cities 
ltLiCh as New Yorlc, San Francisco 
and Washington, D.C. Each year, 
reputable guests and professionals 
from all over the nation view the 
BNPF productions. 'This effon isn't 
made to produce a walloping "wow" 

from us nonnal people, but so that 
the playwrights can "make contacts 
and let them meet all of our work:, " 
Lord said. Art can be quite a practi-
cal business as well. 

In layman's terms: It's theater 
and it's entertainment, so with 
some spare time, why not check out 
what BNPF is all about. You may 
be surprised at what talents UCSD 
has to offer in its theatrical depart-
ment. 

"I promise none of the plays are 
boring. We're in our 20s, we're 
writing things that people on cam-
pus can relate to," McKee said . 

The plays run April 14 through 
April 24. TIckets can be purchased 
ticket by calling the box office at 
(858) 534-4574. General admis-
sion tickets are SIS; UCSD affiliate 
and seniors S 12; and student admis-
sion is $10. Admissions for the one-
act plays and staged reading are 
free. For more informationl visit

Punk: Rock Against Bush 
resurrects punk icon Biafra 
COIlIinued from page 10 

The tour's articulate muckrak-
er, former Dead Kennedys vocal· 
ist Biafra, delivered a scathing 
attack on the status quo in 
America, criticizing both Bush 
administration p<?licy and failure 
on the part of the citizenry to 
demand change - a failure that 
the Rock Against Bush tour hopes 
to overcome in its quest to regis-
ter voters. During and before the 
concert, worken were stationed at 
key points and at tables in the 

lobby, registering concertgoers to 
vote . 

While it remains to be seen 
whether or not Punk Voter 
achieves its goal of registering half 
a miUion new voters, it nonethe-
less offers some hope for the rele-
vance of this now decades-old sub-
culture. If nothing else, Rock 
Against Bush indicates that mod-
ern punic. rock, thought by many to 
have bowed out of the political 
arena, can still serve as an impor-
tant medium for change.

fifth time this season, breaking the 
Triton single-season record for

overall. 

The game was the 6naI home 
match for Triton seniors WaDer, 
Keyser, Andy Rupp and Shawn 
Oksenendler, all four of whom were

"We will miss our seniors next 
year, no doubt about it," Toren 
said. "But we have a lot of starters 
and talent coming back next year. "

Women's track leaves 
top competition in dust 
Men's team has strong 
showing, places third 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Sports Writer 

The UCSD men's and 
women's track and field teams 
bested a number of top-ranked 
rivals at a five-way team meet 
ho ted by YC Riverside on April 
10. The \Comen's team earned 
top honors while the men's team 
finished thjrd. 

T he Triton women fini hed 
first with 234 points, one point 
ahead of Southern Utah. 

"The meet went well overall, 
with the women's team winning 
and beating out several Division I 
teams, which was a surprise 
because several national quali-
fiers did not compete," head 
coach Tony Salerno sajd. 

The UCSD men finjshed ' 
third with 200 points, just two 
points behind second-place 
Southern Utah and 19 points 
behind first-place Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

Fre hman sprinter Elisa 
Holiday was a key standout on 
the women's side, finishing first 
in the long jump and second in 
the 100-meter and 200-meter 
dashes. 

Holiday has made consider-
able headway in her first year. 
Holiday'S jump of 18-2 V4 was 
three and a half inches better 
than her second-place oppo-
nent. 

Holiday's l00-meter time of 
12 .2 1 seconds and her NCAA 
Provisional-qualifying perfor-
mance in the 200-meter dash of 
24.89 econds were both less 
than two-tenths of a second off 
the winning pace. 

The Tritons won several 
other events, including the 
women's high jump and 
women's javelin.

with their marks of 5-4 V4 in the

Senior javelin thrower 
Michc:lle Beebe achieved a dis-
tance that was more than eight 
feet longer than the next com-
petitor, hurling the javelin 132-3. 

Freshman Matt Maybeno and 
sophomore J on Patton secured 
nine points and the lead for the 
men's side with their second-
place finishes in the l00-meter 
and 2oo-meter dashes, respec-
tively. 

Senior Marcus Keller was the 
sale victor for the men's team 
with his jump of 13 .65 meters, 
good enough to win the triple 
jump. Keller also placed fourth in 
the long jump. 

Sophomore Brad Libuit and 
senior Abel Aramburo each 
added an additional nine points

Volleyball downed by Cal Baptist 
Tritons close, but can't hold on in game five 

.yMATTIYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Triton men's volleyball 
team lost its home finale to 
California Baptist University, 3-2, 
in a non-conference match on 
April 13. Despite its good start, 
UCSD was unable to defeat the 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics top-
ranked Lancers. Cal Baptist pre-
vailed, taking three of five games, 
24-30,30-26, 30-28, 24-30, 15-8. 

In the first game, the Tritons 
were down, 12 -13, but scored six of 
the next seven game points to take 
an 18-14 lead. The Tritons were 
able to hold on the rest of the 
match and win game one. 

"We came out and played 
hard," junior outside hitter Adam 
Toren said. "We have beaten qual-
ity top-ranked opponents 1Ilready 
this year and so we knew we had a 
good chance." 

The Tritons looked good in 
game two, taking a 16-15 lead. 
After a timeout, however, the visit-
ing Lancers quickly acted and went 
up, 18-16. The frame was tied four 
more times. Cal Baptist flexed its 
muscles and took a 26-25 advan-
tage.

Tritons tied the match.ilt 25-25 on 
a triple block by senior Jim Waller, 
senior Kevin Keyser and Toren. 
Each team then went on 2-0 mini-
runs to tie it at 27-27 . A kill by Cal 
Baptist, followed by a service error, 
made the score 28-28. Kills by the 
Lancers' junior opposite Shaun 
Dyk and sophomore outside hitter 
Seiju Ajanako gave the Lancers the 
lead in the match, 2-1. 

UCSD controlled the fourth 
game from beginning to end, 
jumping out to an 11-3 lead, a score 
which Cal Baptist could not sur-
mount. Having forced a fifth and 
deciding game, the Lancers, like 
the Tritons in the fourth game, led

Golf takes 10th at Buzzini Invite Don't blaIne Kobe for 
Lakers' shortcomings Tritons can't reach top-10 individually 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team compet-
ed in the Cal State Stanislaus 
Buzzini Invitational on April 12 
and April 13 , held at the Turlock 
Country Club in Turlock, Calif., 
and finished lOth in a field of 18 
teams. 

"It's a very interesting course; 
it's an old design, very short and 
tight, with hard and fast greens," 
UCSD head coach Mike Wydra 
said. "It was deceptively difficult 
for its length. T he course requires 
some local knowledge to play, and 
we didn't have many people who 
had played it before. I think we 
started to take to it, and if we had 
more time to play, we would've 
figured it out." 

On April 12, UCSD struggled 
in the early round, rurning a 307 
as a team, one of its highest 
rounds of the year. The Tritons 
came back to break under the 300 
mark with a 296. But with their 
301 on April 13, they finished 
with a total of 904, 40 over par. 

"Next week is the start of the 

conference championships, and 
the course couldn't be more dia-
metrically opposed to [Turlock]," 
Wydra said. "The mark of a good 
team is [its] ability to adjust to any 
course; I don't think we're going 
to see many more courses like 
this, though." 

California 
Collegiate 
Athletic 
Association-
rival UC Davis 
took first place 
over.all, finish -
ing with an 
865, Qne over 
par. Its team 
shot rounds of 
287, 287 and 
2 9 1 
Tournament 
host Cal State 

was the top Triton 
finisher at the 

Buuini Invitational 

Stanislaus turned in rounds of 
294,281 and 292, to finish at 867, 
three over par. Cal State 
Bakersfield rounded out the top 
three with scores of 287, 292 and 
298, for a total of 877, 13 over par. 

Individually, junior Brian 
Duckworth controlled. the num-

ber-one spot for the Tritons and 
tied' for 28th place overall. 
Despite a difficult first round of 
79, he came bade on the afternoon 
of April 12 to shoot a 73 and 
parred April 13'5 round at 72 . He 
finished with a score of 224, eight 
over par. 

Senior team captain Alan 
Scheer and . sophomore Ryo 
Yamada tied for second place on 
the Triton squad, strong enough 
for 43rd place overall, earning a 
total of 228, 12 over par. Scheer 
shot rounds of 77, 75 and 76, 
while Ryo turned in scores of 76, 
77 and 75. 

Junior Joe Dolby took the 
four-spot for the Tritons and tied 
for 57th in the field, with a score 
of 232, 16 over par. Like 
Duckworth, he began on April 12, 
with an 82, far above par, but 
came back to par the afternoon 
round at 72. Dolby finished with a 
78 on April i3 . 

Sophomore Justin Grant 
rounded out UCSD's team, one 
shot behind fellow teammate

Winning is never just one

Matthew Grant 

Kobe Bryant did not go into 
the April II game between the 
Los Angeles Lakers and 
Sacramento Kings aiming ' to 
bring his team down or to throw 
the game. Grarned, Kobe took 
only one shot in the entire first 
half of the game, and ultimately 
finished the contest with a near 
career-low eight points in 40 min-
utes of floor time, it is ludicrous 
to suggest that Kobe was retaliat-
ing for comments about him 
hoarding the ball and taking too 
many shots made by teammates, 
IS the media might have us think. 

. Give the Kings some credit 
here, . people. Kobe says ' he was 
double- and triple-teamed for 
most of that game, and essentially 
shut down by a seamless 
Sacramento defense. Why is this a 
surprise? Kobe went into the game 
as the fourth-ranked player in the 
NBA for points per game. If you 
were directing the Kings' game 
plan, wouldn't it be logical to 
eliminate the greatest threat? 
Sure, everyone expected him to 
come out red-hot and put in 30 
highlight-reel-caliber shots, but 
the Kings did their job. Get off his 
back. 

The biggest question that I 
have after this game is, how can a 
102-85 loss be attributed com-
pletely to Kobe's lack of scoring? 
After aU, there were four other
