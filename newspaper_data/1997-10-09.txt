"ALIENUTION" IS A FALLACY 
Editor : 

If Ihl.: earlh is a giant computer. 
Ihl!n I think Ihat il has just hlown a 
fe" circuil~. According 10 Jess)!ca 
Wallace, (,The Origins of Life on 
Earth." Sept. 29). "skeplics, scien-
tist> and religious folk" alike ought 
to be fleeing from their philow-
phies, rl.:\l.:arch and melanarralives 
for Ihc new theory of the origin, of 
life: The Theory of Alicnution! 

This theory is more ClrcumSlan-
tial than 0.1. 's alibi. The faci that 
some computer took every Ihird 
word OUI of the Hebrew Scriptures 
(or whatever the supposed encod-
ing entaib) and revealed Ihe same 
fact s I can find in my high ~chool 
hi~tory hook docs lillie to con vincI.: 
a person like myselr thai thl.: planel 
Earth was impregnated wilh rejecl-
cd aliens. 

As an aspiring sciemist and <l lso 
a Christian , I nced morc proof than 
Ihe apparent lack of answers to a 
few antagoni/ing questions such 
as, "how exactly wl.:rc the Jews jU~1 
raising sheep oul in Ihe de~crt for 
40 years when Iherc was no food 
for the sheep to cal," in order 10 
helieve , or di~believe . 
Furthcrmore, ciling D(lug l a~ 
Ad<lms (who is <In ingeniou~ 
writer) ", an aUl hority on human 
origin, is like quoting Sleven Jay 
Gould in a hook on religJOu, doc-
Irine.

6 OPINION 

RELIGION: 
Science and the Bible 
may never agree 
ContInued fro. ..... 4 
rationalistic ~idc that is uncom-
mon. for instance. in Oriental reli -
gIOn, . 

The theory that the revelation 
cannot contradict reason. and that 
reason correctly applied ~hould be 
able to prove that the sl: ripture~ are 
an original creation of Christian 
philosophers. most noticeably. Sun 
Augustin and San Thomas 
Aquinas. We owe all the " pmof~" 
of the existence of God. from SI. 
Anselm 's ontological argument to 
Kant and Boole. to thi ~ very doc-
trine. 

As a theory of gno is. however. 
this approach i~ fundamentally 
nawed for two rea,on ~ : fir>t . 
becau,e of the Greek intluence, it 
i, purely deducti ve; >cwnd , 
hecause of its theological founda-
tion. it must assume t.he validity of 
Ihe scripture~. and never que~lion 
it. 

Theologi cal rationalit y ha, 
alway~ been steri le for rreci,ely

account, enough to make the two 
compatible, even with the quite 
relaxed standards that re ligiou ~ 
writers used in these case,. 

God created all the spec ies one 
by one. and Ihat is it. Considcr 
also that anthropology is not an 
exacl ;.cience as is phy,ics. 

It i\ not possible to make 
ex periments that directly invali -
date It ~ theo rl e;. (in the , tn ctest 

~e n se, anlhropology 1\ not an 
expcrimen tal ~c i e nce), but we 
llluM rely on indirect ev idcm;c and 
whatever fo;.sib nalure is kind 
enough to prc;.erve for us. 

Abo. the basis for evolution is 
in gene ti c~. and genctics is young 
enough a sCience to create con~id ­
erahle dehale around the exaci 

rnec hanl~rn' thai cau\e the ",mall 
mutation," pmlUl ated hy Oarwll1. 
For all thew n.:a\om. evo lution I~ 

a marvelou~ target for a quick 
allack on sc ience. 

I believe that most attacks to 
evolutioni sm are philowphically 
off the poinl, for the same reasons 
that I menlioned above. In addi-
tion, it is wOl1h noticing that reli-
giou s commentators always 
choose their targets somewhat ad· 
/10('. 

Thcy are not disturbed by the 
fact that. in ~eve ra l places. the 
Bible hint s to an car1h atthc ccnter 
of the uni ve r~e (Giordano Bruno 
wa, bumed in Campo de Fiori in 
Rome for this), or at the troubled 
conci liation or an omniscicnt God 
with the doctrine of free will . 

Were thcy coherent. a ban on 
all space activity, from planetary 
exploration to communication 
satellite,. shou Id be requested. 

Logical inconsistencies in the 
Bihle. like the fact thai Mallhew 
and Luke give two different and 
incompat ihle genea log le~ to Jesus 
are ignored. and ~o is the fact that 
God ,eem~ to have ,aid very dif-
ferent and inco mpatible things to 
Christians and Hindu . 

It is hard to take se riously 
allaeks so obviously biased when 
such deep problems are not even 
con;.idered. In tryi ng to ~weep 
them under the rug we are doing a 
favor neither to ~cience nor to 
reli gion. 

Ultimately, whether you 
choo;.e to believe In w me reli -
gious doctrine is a mailer of per-

~on a l incl ination and education. 
All organiled religIOns. however.

LEIIER: 
Myths of equality are 
merely ignorant hype 
ContInued from ..... I 
did pass seems to substantiate 
some people's opinions on the 
subject. because they assume that 
the general public is on their side. 
When Time and CNN conducted 

re~earch before the election. they 
found that 80 percent of 
Americans fe lt that aflirrnative 
action should be continued at 
some level. 

One of the things that helped 
209 pass was that it forced people 
to make an all-or-nothing choice. 
Many California voters chose to 
take the safe route, per~uaded by 
the argument that di crimination 
in any form i ~ wrong. 

BUI even an ac tion as wrong 
al> killing another human being is 
in some ~ ilUati on s not only justi -
fied , but necessary. Our very 
legal system acknowledgcs the 
importance of context and con-
sidering ihe motives behind an 
action. 

No action is inherently right 
or wrong - the judgment often 
depends on the circumstance~ 
.l eading up to the action. and the 
purpose behind it. 

A~ Stanley FI~h of Duke 
University poin ted out , "It wa~ 
the cxpre,s purpose of some pow-
erful white American, to discn-

franchi~e. cnsla ve and later 
exploit black Americans ... whcre-

a~ proponent s of affirmat ive 
action did not set out to deprive 
yOUi rri.:nd ', cou>ln's ~()n of a 
place at Harvard." 

The actual numher of whiles

who arc even affected by affirma-
tive action pales in compari on to 
the number of blacks and other 
minori ties who have heen held 
back hy current and past d i ~cri 111-
ination. 

This i, espec ially true in the 
workplace where the U.S. Censu, 
Bureau cites that affirmative 
action affects less than 2 percent 
of white workers. 

I suspect that it i, not the 
financial impact that makes 
affirmative action such a threat, 
rather it is the mental impact -
many whites do not even want to 
think ahout how they as a people 
got where they are today. let 
alone admit that in 1997. the 
best thing to be in America is 
st ill a white male. 

Mr. Williams showed hi s true 
color, when he referred to the 
slavery era as a "violation of 
social norms." (I suppose he 
wou ld consider the Holocaust to 
have heen a di splay of bad man-
ners). 

Well, consider the enormity 
of the "violalion" in question, 
and its after-effects. Blacks have 
been in thi s country for about 
375 years. spending 245 of those 
years in slavery. and another 100 
year, with lega ll y-sa nctioned 
discrimination in everything 
from johs to education to hous-
ing. That only leaves about 30 
year, where blacks have heen 
given even the slightest chance 
to calch up. 

To elililinate affirmativl! 
aetlon now is like having an HO-
yard head start in a JO()-yard foot 
racl!. Ihen ,ay lng "O.K .. now l\!1 ',

camp, des pite the facl thai the onl

Although the labor forever affected 
him physicall y, McGrew sa id that 
he is stronger in other ways. 

"My body's beaten up, but I still 
have my mind." McGrew said. 

Although the stories they heard 
were often disturbing, students 
who attended the lecture said" they 
felt it was the stories' realism 
which made the panel 's visit so 
worthwhile. 

"It was shocking, but it puts a 
face with what we' ve read," said 
June Chang, a Revelle sophomore. 

"Too often hislory comes from a 
book and historians put their own 
views in it ," said Jessie Gessin, a 
Marshall sophomore. "This is his-
tory, unfiltered and pure." 

OSD: Niman 
claims services are 
inadequate 
Continued from pace 3 

The OSD's staff includes a 
learning disability special ist and a 
clinical psychologist who is avail-
able four times a week. 

The OSD also helps students 
receive handicapped-parking plac-
ards from the Department of Motor 
Veh icles.. The OSD provides 
American Sign Language/oral 
interprcters, readers, notetakers 
and a peer-mentoring program for 
new and transfer students. 

"The resources are availahle so 
don't forget to ask ," said Niman. 

According to Niman, although 
both OSD and C.A.D.R.E. provide 
information to RA's, undergradu-
ates. graduates and faculty, they 
hope to ex tend their services 
beyond that and provide informa-
tion about OSD and C.A.D.R.E. to 
the entire campus community. 
Niman said their future goals 
include providing more informa-
tion to professors and improving 
the quality and variety of services 
on campus. 

"The services on campus are 
just not adequate enough." Niman 
said.

While we were shooting she 'd 

be reading On Ihe Road by 
Kerouac or Grapes of Wralh by 
Steinbeck and I'd go, "Hey 
Marissa, is that something your 
character would be reading '!" and 
she'd say "No I'Ill reading up for 
Illy mid-term." At the time they 
were lilming she was goi ng to 
UCLA so in a way she was living a

was playing. 
What was it like to work 
with Zappa and Ryan? 

Both Moon Zappa and Mari ssa 
have a very rare quality as actress-
es - they can both put themsclve, 
up on the screen. When you talk to 
them in person they have the ~all1e 

The UCSD Guardian 

"While W8 were 
shooting she'd be 
reading On the Roed 
by Kerouac or 
Grapes of Wrath by 
Steinbeck and I'd 
go, 'Hey Marl_, Is 
that something your 
character would be 
reading?'"

, p.:cch pattern, and salll': quirks 
that arc as pn:scntll1 their pt:r,onal -
itie, as tht:} are on the ,creen. 

I thinl<- thai ,peal.., reall} well 

for the director and the actor 
because as a director, that is one of 
the hardest things - to make an 
actor play naturally - without 
affectations or weird accents that 
they may use as a crutch. 
Can men relate to this as 
well as women? 

There is a universalit y, espec ial-
ly in the American conscience, 
ahout the wide open road. There is 
a lot of Ihal evident in literature -
for example, Jack Kerouac . 
U,ua ll y thl! hcro IS the guy, but If 
you luk.: the char:lcterist ics of the 
g.:nre. the opl!n road and lots of 
rock and ro ll . the men can relate to 
It. 
Where did you film the 
scenes for the roacJ.trip? 

HlA11JS II 

We filmed in San Diego, 
Washington and Las Vegas. San 
Diego is Hollywood 's best-kept 
secret hecause there are so many 
locals within a short driving dis-
tance; diverse geography and archi -
tecture . 
Were there any problems 
with shootinc scenes in Las 
Vegas? 

Funny enough. Vega, was one 
or the easiest places to ,hoot in . 
Our production designer. 
Mauricio de Aguimlco wa~ the 
same as for "Like Waler For

Following on the heels of their 
hugely ~ucce~s ftJl 1995 release, 
Sparkle and Fade, Evcrclear stich 
to what works for them on their 
third album, So Much jur Ihl' 
Ajrerlilow. Lead by the emotional -
ly-packed, Mory-:.tyle lyrics of lead 
singer and gui tari st Art Alexaki ~, 
Everc lear di5hes out another record 
full of punk , in~pired rock worthy 
of blasting out of your speakers. 

Continuing with the trend intro-
duced on Sparkle and Fade, most 
of Ihe tracks on Afterglow maintain 
a poppy yet heavy feel . Alexak.is 
heads up most of the instrurr :1tal 
work with his solid guitar riffs. 
Everclear offers a little more on 
this album, however, adding strings 
in "Amphetamine," horns in "One 
Hit Wonder," banjo in "Why I 
Don't Believe in God" and organ in 
other songs. 

As usual, Alexakis' lyrics make 
many references to his past, mostly 
to his heroin addiction; however, 
his lyrics are not necessarily auto-
biographical. That would seem 10 
be the case on Afterglow, even 
Ihough the emotional charge stays

**** 

After collaborating witb · an 
impressive paletle of orchestral and 
electronic talent, Bjork emerges 
with her most innovative album to 
date, Homogenic. 

The Icelandic vocalist's popu-
larity amongst international audi-
ences has endured a 20-year career. 
The strength of Bjork's solo work 
is dependent on great dance-music 
producers and lush orchestralions, 

Each song on Homogenic con-
tains arresting qualities, including 
the string arrangements of Eumir 
Deodato. The album is also dance-
able from beginning to end, with 
distorted electronic beats that are 
comparable to those of Aphex 
Twin, Autechre and LFO. 

Bjork's vocals,like the growls of 
a tigress, spark an emotional high.

Battle Of The Bands 
CLyde s Ride came out on. top Tuesday as bands duked it 

out at the Belly Up Tavern s "Neighborhood Watch" 
By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Tuesday nights are normally 
evenings UCSD students utilize for 
watching "Frasier" or "Horne 
Improvement" on the idiot box 
while putting off their studies for a 
more suitable time (sm;h as the 
night before the midterm). 
However, if you are into the local 
music scene and enjoy di scovering 
new bands, you should turn off the 
boob tube and make your way 
down to the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach to check out the 
Neighborhood Watch. 

Derek Sapico, the male vocalist 
from Clyde's Ride, one of the 
bands that performed thi s past 
Tuesday, described the 
Neighborhood Watch as a good 
ex perience. "I' m glad a lot of 
groups with different styles get a 
chance to play together, even 
though I have some reservations 
about the whole competition 
aspect," he said . 

The Neighborhood Watch is a 
no-cover. Tuesday night conte~t 
fealuring three local hand, which 
eaeh perform a 45-minute set. On 
normal night ~, the be~t band i ~ cho-
sen by crowd ballot. The winning 
hand then returns tor the Best of

~ urr-pu nk hand out ot OceanSide 
wllh a \ound reminiscent of 
Pe nnywise. Inenia , a band OUI of 
Del Mar that sounded remarkably 
likc Pearl Jiun and l 'CSD's own 

A very high energy 
group with a tight 
lOund, The Union 
came out pumped 
up and went 
through their entlr. 
set at the same 
frenetic pace. With 
the lead singer's 
flying dreadlocks 
and funky dance 
steps 
accompanying the 
Intense vocals and 
driving rhythms, the 
whol. set was a 
high-adrenaline 
experience. 

Clyde 's Ride. the opening act from 
Sun God 1997 wi th the funky jan 
sound. 

The Union went on lirst, taklllg 
Ihe ~tage just after 9 p.m. A very 
high energy group with a tight 
,ound , The Union came out 
pumped up and went th rough their 
entire set al the same freneti c pace. 
With the lead ~lIlger's !lying dread-
locks and funk y - dance step' 
Jccompanying the i Ilt c n~c vucal\ 
and drivrng rhythms. the whole ,CI 
w,,, a high-adre naline ex penence. 
In hetween '() Ilg~, crowd mcmber, 
would sporadically chant out "0-

~idl! ," and a few patrons even made 
an allempl at dancing, although a 
1110;h pit would probably ha ve been 
l110re approprime for the mu,ic. 

Clyde\ Ride performed the sec-
(Uld set or the cvening, and a large 
contingent of UCSIJ people 
l> howed their , upport hy cheering 
loud l} and dancing throughout the 
pcrrormance. At the start of the l>CI 
II wa, mostly the girls danCing 

around in front of the stage, but 
after the guys had a chance to down 
a few brews and work up the requi -
si te courage they joined in as well. 

Despite a horn section playing 
together for the first timc, Clydc's 
Ride's set sounded fairly tight. A 
relatively young band, Clyde 's 
Ride seems to get beller eat.:h time 
they play, and Tuesday was no 
exception. It seemed as if the whole 
crowd of around 300 people was 
dancing and following their funky 
grooves. The best songs featured 
strong horns, jazzy base and guitar, 
and the male and female vocalists 
harmonizing all blending together 
for a synergistic sound. 

The evening's final band was 
Inertia, and they did not disappoint. 
They too brought a large and vocal 
following, many of whom were 
sporting Inertia stickers on con-
spicuous, eye-catching locations on 
thei r persons. The lead singer did 

~ound a lot like Eddie Vedder, and 
even adopted some of the Pt:arl 
Jam singer's soulful expressions 
while he crooned out hi~ songs. 
Inertia kept the energy level high 
throughout their 45-lllinUle ~et, 
much to the delight of the dancing 
and swaying t.:rowd. 

Whcn the evening was over, the 
judges awarded the Best of thc 
Quarter designation 10 Clyde\ 
Ride, to the chagrin of die-hard 
Inertia ~lIpporter~ who chanted 
"Bulhh*t!" urlljl Clyde's Ride lead

''The fact that we won doesn 't 
mean anything," he said . 
"Everyone had a good timc, and 
that 's what Illall er~."

New York Doll s and David Bowie,

Morm\ey\ youth ultimately ~ur­
faced in 1m music, bot h wllh The 
Smith , and in hi s so lo work . In 
both , he w mbined Wi ll Y, Illerale 
Iyri !:s with a pure pop sensihi lity. 

After leaving school al age 17, 
Morri ssey toiled in a seri es (I f 
menial jobs. In 19M2, guitarist 
Johnny Marr invited him to join a 
hand , and months later The Smith, 
hurst onto the Brit i,h mu"c scene. 

Numerou~ BBC radio broadcasts 
allracted an impres,ive enthusiasti c 

following even before the release 
of their debut album, The Smiths, 

When their second album, 
Meat Is Murder, entered the 
Brili sh charts at number one and 
went go ld within a week, The 
Smiths had staked their claim, 

With each subsequent release. 
The Smiths further strengthened 
their impression on the music 
world. Johnny Rogan, author of 
Morrissey & Murr: The Severed 
Alliunre, hailed them as the mosl 
critically acclaimed and musically 
accomplished ense mhle of the 
decade, 

However, in 1987. the group 
di,handed after ri ve short years. 
The hlggest ques tion among cri t-
ICS concerned Morri ssey " fUlure; 
many a.,sumed he'd he nothing 
without Marr. Morrissey told Spill. 
'The general opinIOn wa, that 
onc~ Johnny Marr unplugged that 
umhilical cord I would ju~ t kind of 
deflate like a paddling pooL" 

M()rri,~ey answereu hi ~ critics 
with the "Sucdchead" ~ ing lc and 
Vi" a fielle, both in'tant criti ca l 
favorites in America and England . 
Things got rocky fo r him, howev-

from Bona Drug and Kill Uncle

di vided critic, and fan~ on multi-

In the U. K., Morrissey was 
accused of vu rious indiscretions 
\uch as mci,m, elhnocentrl sm and 
Jingoism. The,e a ll egat ion~ led to 
Radio One hlackout \ and head-
line-g rahhing pro t e~ l s, hut 
Morrissey remained , ilent fo r the

PICKLE: 
It's a game, not a 
sexual reference 
Continued from pace 20 
past dark . 

For part of my life, my famil y 
was fortunate 10 live on a proper-
ty that had a good-,ited lawn, 
never mind the fact that it was 
~urrounded hy I rees on most sides 
and ro,e hushes on the rest. Ever)' 
evening we would ,et up a 
make,hirt lield going in the <.Iiret.:-
li on or Ihe rose bushes, which 
gave u\ a few scratche, going 
alter f1 } ha ll s, bUI Ihey were 
merely fl e,h wounds, 

I do recall une instan!:c when 
my brother hi t a , mas h through 
the back window of a parked car. 
We ran off and blamed the dam-
age on an acorn falling from the 
oak tree until someone produced 
the evidence. I don ' t remember 
what we had for dinner that night 
- il might have been soap, 

All these memories and more 
are, for the most part (barring the 
ace whooping). good one,. My 
sport> memories at UCS D. at 
least the one, I can rememher, 
have heen good ones. too . 

Th rough my limited time writ -
II1g hen: and through the dorms. I 
have had the opportunit y (0 
hefriend a few of t he sport , 
"stars" on th i, campus. I re'pec i 
Ihem for their deSire and Ihelr 
love of the ;.port they play. It 

amazes me to see many of them 
get up at 6 a.m. every weekday 
and head to the gym in addition to 
attending two practices a day, not 
to mention classes. 

From my dealings with the 
water polo team, I have discov-
ered some interesting tidbits of 
information. Each player on the 
leam must do maintenance on the 
pool for two weeks at a time in 
the wee hours of the morning 
hecause the water polo program i, 
strapped for money and needs 
n:venuc in any way possihle. 
AI,o, all the UCSD teams' mem-
ber, must sell T-shirl ' to pay for 
tcam cx pen~e, . 

It Illay seelll ludicrous, hut 
hey, we are nOI a Division I 
,("hool. Thi ~ means, as you all 
must know by now, no scholar-
ships and not much cash flow, 

So to all those who snicker 
when they think of UCSD sports 
- don' t. First of all , they don ' l 
have the student support that most 
other schools have, 

It is amazi ng however, to 'ee a 
large erowd show up lO a game 
and to witnc~s the difference in 
Ihe level of play, The Tritons play 
like a team rejuvenated when a 
hig crowd turns out ; they 're so 
ali ve and dominant when they 
have a hig fan lurnout. Second, 
our teams don 't have the moncy, 
hut they make do anyway. And 
third, we ll there i;. no thiru . SO 
~uc k It up. go to a game and we' ll 
sec YOLi unlil ncxt time.

RIVALS: 
UCSD is now 11-1 
against rival Cal Lu 
Continued from page 20 
fell to 7-l 

Cal Lutheran took charge of the 
contest carlyon, coming danger-
ously close 10 scoring a goal in the 
first 13 minutes of the match. Holly 
Roepke's shol. however, ricocheted 
off the ri ght post and Ihe score 
remained 0-0. The Regab - a 
team never ~ hy aboul playing on 
the edge - ulili /.ed a number of 
slide la c kl L:~ to \\ in ball s e;II'ly in 
Ihe conle~t. 

In the second half, UCSD used 
superi or fitness to pres, a fading 
Cal Lu squad. At 78 :37. Janine 
Harispe walked the walk after talk-
ing the talk earlier in the week, as 
she scored Ihe game- winner. 

With the quickness of a crafty 
veteran, the sophomore defender 
buried freshman Cindy Doslalek' s 
rehound off the crossbar with II 
minules left in the game for a 1-0 
victory. 

Jennifer Hetland recorded her 
eighlh shutout of the season, top-
ping all fi ve shots that were fired at 
her. 

UCSD will relurn home to hosl 
Savannah College of An & De;.ign

header thi s Friday ni ght al Trit on
