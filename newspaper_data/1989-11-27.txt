Students Rally Against U.S. 
Involvement In EI Salvador 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior StajfWriter 

A crowd of about 150 students listened to 
several speakers decry U.S. involvement in 
the civil war in EI Salvador during a CM 
Cafe-sponsored rally at the hump last Wed-
nesday. 

In recent weeks fighting has intensified 
in the IO-year war between the U.S.-sup-
ported EI Salvadoran government and the 
leftist Farabundo MartC National Liberation 
Front. Thousands have reportedly been 
killed. 

Brad Fields, a community worker with 
the Lutheran Church of EI Salvador, spoke 
of his recent arrest and deportation from that 
country. 

"Over the last week about 15 of us 
[community workers] each day were ar-
rested ... handcuffed, blindfolded, interro-
gated, and then, as a condition of our liberty, 
forced to sign a paper saying we will leave 
the country. That's why I'm here. 

"There were lots of people near us in the 
cells who had been tortured, been beat up, 
kicked, had their ribs broken. A man down 
the ball from me had a forced water enema 
... people [ were] crying to be killed," Fields 
said. 

Fields also spoke in favor of negotiation 
to stop the war. 

Diego, spoke in memory of the slain priests. 
"Although I did not know the martyred 

priests ... I do know of their care for the 
people of EI Salvador. They were academ-
ics; they were not soldiers ... These scholars 
were using their brains for the better of the 
common good." he said. 

Mandala also expressed concern for the 
safety of other church workers in the war-
tom country. 

"This heinous crime was not an isolated 
incident ... America continues to support a 
regime in EI Salvador that can obviously not 
guarantee the basic safety of its people," 
Mandala said. 

Alice Lara, from the San Diego-based 
Central American Information Center, urged 
students to join a boycott of American cof-
fee companies that farm in EI Salvador. 
Fields later said the boycott was supported 
by unions and cooperatives in EI Salvador. 

"If you're educated [about the situation 
in EI Salvador], that's great You now have 
an obligation to do something ... coffee is 
tainted withblood, and it must stop," Lara 
said. 

After a brief question-and-answer pe-
riod, the rally was opened to speakers from 
the au8lence. In an impassioned speech, 
Cecilia UbiUa-Arenas, a counselor with 
O.A.S.lS., condemned student apathy about 
events in EI Salvador, which she saw as 
evident in the small number of students who 
showed up at the rally. 

See RALLY, page 8 
A UCSD student involved in Wednesday's rally on the hump listens to speeches 
given by concerned citizens and a local priest. 

"The insurgents in EI Salvador have too 
much popular support to lose. The govern-
ment has too much support from our govern-
ment to lose ... The next step is to force the 
govemment and the front to a negotiated end 
to the war," Fields said. Conflict· Arises Over Door-Locking Policy 

On Nov. 16, six Jesuit priests, a woman, 
and the woman's 15-year-old daughter were 
murdered in a Catholic university in EI 
Salvador. One of the priests was a vocal 
leftist, and it is suspected that the murders 
were committed by a right-wing military 
"death squad," according to news reports.

Student Fee Proposal Calls 
For 4.7 Percent Increase 
By NICOLA WHITEHEAD 
Contribllting Writer 

The UC Board of Regents recently ap-
proved an increase in student registration 
fees of 4.7 percent for California residents 
and 2.5 percent for non-residents. 

From estimates based on the Board's 
Nov. 17 decision, a UC education, exclud-
ing room, board, and supplies for the 1990-
91 academic year, will cost California resi-
dents $1,703 and non-residents $7,619. 

However, Laurie Itow, a representative 
from the UC president's office pointed out 
that the fee increase must first receive the 
approval of the state legislature.

"The Board of Regents does not imple-
ment the increase ... it has to be approved by 
the state legislature," she said. 

According to Pa.ul West, also of the of-
fice of the President, the 4.7 percent increase 
is comparable to inflation. The funds will be 
used to cover the costs of employees' salary 
increases and price increases in general. 

For the academic year of 1989-90, a 
budget surplus pennined the state legisla-
ture to lower the UC-proposed student fee 
increase from 10 percent to three percent. 

"At this point [the increase] is not to 
cover a budget deficit. as last year," West 
said.

state fire codes, was enacted Nov. 9, one 
week after the college was notified of viola-
tions found during a fire inspection last 
August. according to Muir Assistant Resi-
dent Dean Kathie Poff. 

Because the doors lock automatically, 
the resident dean staff considers the policy 
to be a security boost. Many students, how-
ever, consider the added security to be 
unnecessarily paternalistic. 

Opinions on both sides of the issue were 
aired last Tuesday when Muir administra-
tors held a "town meeting" to discuss the 
new policy and solicit student suggestions 
as to how it might be amended or made more 
workable. 

"I'm quite interested . . . to come up with 
something students are going to follow. I 
think we have quite a dilemma here," said 
Muir Resident Dean Pat Danylyshyn-
Adams, explaining that she wants to avoid 
any policy that would be widely circum-
vented by residents. 

Karen Toomey, chairperson of the Muir 
College Council, explained at the meeting's 
outset that, although suite doors must re-
main closed to comply with the fire code, the 
door policy is still amendable in some re-
spects. 

Toomey said that one part of the policy 
that could be revised involves whether lock-

able/unlockable doors and bathroom doors 
should be locked 24 hours a day. 

From the administration's standpoint, the 
new policy presents an opportunity to in-
crease dorm safety- the deans need only 
leave the existing self-locking suite doors in 
place. 

"Our part of the decision has to do with 
security and liability," Poff said in a post-
meeting interview. 

Poff pointed to a stack of community 
alert bulletins on her desk as an indication of 
the presence of crime on campus and of the 
need for security precautions. 

Nonetheless, many students have ex-
pressed resentment over what they consider 
to be an overprotective policy. 

"I don't think anybody expects that we 
are going to be provided a completely secure 
place ... I think that's pretty much an 
impossibility," Muir resident Dori Rosen-
thal said during the meeting. 

"Your parents want that," Danylyshyn-
Adams interjected before Rosenthal contin-
ued. 

"I think when ... you go away to school, 
and you're on your own, you are in charge of 
being secure and taking responsibility for 
your actions," Rosenthal 'iaid, adding that 
security issues should "be addressed on the

AMES Seeks Grant For Study 
Of Dynamic Processing 

The department of applied mechanics and engineer-
ing science at UCSD recently received approval from 
the UC Regents to seek a $15 million multi-institutional 
and multi-disciplinary grant from the National Science 
Foundation to study dynamic processes in materials . 

The five-year project would be underthe direction of 
Siavouche Nemat-Nasser, a professor of applied me-
chanics and engineering science and director of the 
Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials at UCSD. 

Nemat-Nasser would be assisted by two deputy 
directors, one from UCSD and one from the Califomia 
Institute of Technology , two affirmative action coordi-
nators, and an industrial liaison committee. 

Three subcontracts with other universities are in-
cluded with the proposal. These include Caltech, the 
City College of New York, and Howard University. 

The program would be housed at UCSD and would 
bring together scientists from other universities, na-
tionallaboratories and industry for scientific exchange 
and collaborative research. 

If the proposal is funded, it would become a Univer-
sity Organized Research Unit and would serve as an 
intellectual forum to pursue research and provide doc-
toral and postdoctoral education in an integrated pro-
gram encompassing materials science, mechanics, shock 
physics and chemistry, and mathematics and computa-
tion supporting a research focus on dynamiC processes 
in materials. 

IR/PS Receives Gift of $2 Mil 
The UC Regents last week approved a $2 million gift 

for UCSD's Graduate School oflnternational Relations 
and Pacific Studies (tRIPS) that will strengthen the fi -
nancial foundation of the nation's only graduate school 
to focus on the Pacific Basin. 

This is the first major gift to the Graduate School 
si nce its founding in 1986. The donors are Lawrence

critical if we are to build the strong foundation we need 
for future growth." 

The Robinsons' involvement in lRlPS stems from 
their concern about American competitiveness in the

Firing of Controversial Radio 
Host Contested at UCSB 

DecisionsmadebythemanagementofKCSB,UCSB's 
radio station, were called into question last Thursday as 
the Associated Students Radio Council grilled the UCSB 
radio station general manager about the dismissal of 
former talk show host Sean Hannity. 

The hearing marked the first step in Hannity's appeal 
for full reinstatement to his position at KCSB. Hannity 
was taken off the air after a controversial April 4 program 

by Bill Watterson 

with Gene Antonio. author of The AIDS Cover up? Tire 
Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS. Management at 
the time said Hannity had violated UCSB and station 
non-discrimination policies. 

Hannity is asking for full reinstatement to the station, 
extra air time to make up for time lost during the appeal 
process, and apologies from the station and university. 

At the hearing, KCSB General Manager Malcolm 
Gault-Williams presented the station's viewpoint on the 
case. He said that a conversation on the April 4 program 
between Hannity, Antonio, and a caller- KCSB Gay 
and Lesbian perspectives host Jody May- was the 
"straw that broke the camel's back" in the decision to 
dismiss Hannity. 

The show, one of two in which Hannity and Antonio 
discussed gay and lesbian lifestyles, generated angry 
reactions from some KCSB programmers and commu-
nity members, and Hannity was removed by the station's 
student manager on the grounds that Hannity's state-
ments over the air violated station and university non-
discrimination policies. 

In the conversation referred to by Gault-Williams, 
Antonio chided May, a lesbian, when told that May re-
cently had hadachiJd by artificial insemination. Antonio 
referred to the child as a "turkey-baster baby" and Han-
nity allegedly seemed to support the remark-though he 
says that he had not understood the comment at the time. 

Hannity, however, claims the conversation was not 
the reason given by then-student manger Cory Krell for 
the dismissal. May, he said, opened herself up to the 
comments by engaging the conversation with her phone 
call. "The lody May incident had nothing to do with my 
dismissal," he said. 

Radio Council members repeatedly asked Gault-
WiU-iams whether alternatives 10 the dismissal- such as 
a suspension or minor violations- were considered. 
They also inquired about the behavior of an ad hoc 
committee formed by Krell to review Hannity's program 
and considered counter-complaints filed by Hannity. 

Gault-Williams said the committee took "over two 
months" to review the case, but neither he, nor Krell, 
could name any of the fi ve committee members' names. 
According to Krell, the commi ttee never met nor did they 
issue a formal recommendation.

Berkeley Students Rally In 
Support Of Sit-In Defendants 

More than 150 students gathered outside UC 
Berkeley's law school last week to show their support for 
the "Boal! Ten." 

Ten Boalt Hall School of Law students are facing mis-
demeanor trespassing charges for a sit -in they staged last 
May in Dean Jesse Choper's office. 

During the May event, the graduate students de-
manded that Choper accelerate hiring of minorities to the 
school's faculty. 

Under Califomia law, trespassing holds a maximum 
penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 

Ana Loya, one of the defendants and a leader of 
yesterday's rally, said that the Coalition for a Diversified 
Faculty helped to organize the event to generate support. 

"We've been offereddifferentdeals,like if we prom-
ise not to sit in again, the charges will be dropped," she 
said. 

"We don't want to senle for anything short of a 
dismissal [of charges]," Loya said, 

Currently, there are six tenured women professors 
and two minority tenured professors (one of whom is a 
woman) on Boah's faculty of about 50. 

Boalt administrators convened a committee to review 
and make recommendations on faculty diversity after a 
day-long student strike last April, during which 95 per-
cent of Boalt's pupils skipped classes. 

Susan Szabo, also a defendant, said that the students 
being charged have not gone to individual faculty mem-
bers for suppon, but are focusing on generating publicity 
for their upcoming trial. 

If convicted, the Boalt students would have a criminal 
record which would damage their ability to take the bar 
exam, Szabo said.

Dying Coyote Caught 
At Student Center 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Adyingcoyotewanderedacross 
campus last Monday before it was 
tranquilized outside the Student 
Center and then put to sleep. 

According to UCSD Police Sgt. 
Jeff Hutchison, the sick coyote was 
first seen several weeks ago in the 
wooded area southeast of the CM 
Cafe. However, a student chased 
the coyote away before it could be 
caught. 

Last Monday, shortly before 9 
a.m., the coyote "was spotted on 
the Muir basketball courts," but 
was not there when police re-
sponded, Hutchison said. 

tranquilize the animal. 
The coyote was shot witha tran-

quilizer blow dart and later put to 
sleep by Veterinary Services, 
Hutchison said. 

Acting Campus Veterinarian 
Phil Robinson explained that Vet-
erinary Services is "responsible for 
veterinary care for all animals 
involved in teaching and research 
[at UCSD] and other uses of ani-
mals on campus." 

According to Robinson, the 
animal was suffering from a vari-' 
ety of ailments. 

"This animal's condition was 
such that the only humane thing to 
do was to put it to sleep," Robinson 
said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

that the animal's .behavior was 
related to its illness." . However, 
the animal has been sen t to a lab to 
determine whether it had rabies , 
Hutchison said. 

Robinson said the animal was 
not a danger to students unless 
someone tried to touch or help it. 

"If someone were to approach it 
in a benign way, they might not 
realize that the animal could bite 
them," Robinson said. " Anyani-
mal that's injured ... may not react 
in a way that's predictable ... it was 
so ill that it was almost fearless of 
people." 

Hutchison said there are many 
coyotes on the outskirts of cam-
pus, particularly in the canyon area 
behind the Warren Apartments. 

"He was probably living in one 
of the canyons around campus ... 
he was probably just looking for a 
place to die," Hutchison said.

Another resident who spoke out 
against keeping suite doors locked 
at all hours explained that she and 
her suitemates have worked out a 
system in which the last suite resi -
dent to tum in for the night is 
responsible for shutting the suite 
door. 

"We're old enough and mature 
enough to make these decisions," 
the resident said. 

Many st udents who spoke at the 
meeting favored adopting locking! 
unlocking suite doors and auto-
matically locking bathroom doors. 
Since bathrooms are accessible 
only through the suites, residents 
said that such a plan would facili -

tate free movement in and out of 
suites while ensuring against 
shower peeping incidents. 

The last such incident occurred 
one week after the new door policy 
was adopted. According to a 
community alert bulletin concern-
ing the daytime incident, "two men 
entered a woman's bathroom, 
opened ashowercurtain, and stared 
at a female resident who was show-

The bulletin went on to explain 
thatthesuitedoorwas locked when 
the woman entered the shower, but

while she was showering.

Later that morning, the Police 
received a report that the coyote 
was spotted near Student Center 
Building " B," and five police offi-
cers were dispatched to the scene 
to try "to keep people away from 
it," Hutchison said. 

"The animal was extremely 
emaciated, and had a rupture of the 
body wall. Some viscera [intes-
tines] were hanging out," he said.

County Animal Control was 
also called, but they were unable to

Building "B" and Gilman Drive

said. 

The UCSD Office of Veteri-

results in severe skin inflamma-
tion, Robinson added.

thing. He couldn't eat and was

According to Denise Whis-
enhunt of the University of Cali-
fornia Student Association 
(UCSA), the UCSA is opposed to 
increases in student fees. How-
ever, the UCSA does support state 
bill AB 1276, which proposes that 
state funding for the UC budget 
should be in direct proportion to 
the amount of money generated by 
student fees. 
Whisenhunt said that the UCSA is 

also supporting State Constitu-
tionalAmendment I, which would 
modify the Gann state spending 
limit to permit increased UC spend-
ing. 

This would allow the annual 
student fee increase to be kept at' 
three to five percent, Whisenhunt 
said. 

"The money is there, but the 
funds are frozen ... by modifying 
the Gann Limit, students won't 
have to come up with the funds," 
she said.

Living On Campus 

Muir Water Problems 
As the end of the quarter approaches, students are preparing 

for winter break. Some are making reservations for flights home, 
and others - because their homes are too far away, perhaps -
are planning on staying in their on-campus apartments over the 
break. 

Except in Muir. It isn't that they aren't allowed to stay there. 
According to a Muir assistant resident dean, students are wel-
come to stay - they just won't have any water. 

The work on the water lines, which is the cause of the trenches 
crisscrossing the Muir Quad, will require turning off the water 
over the break. Fair enough; if the work has to be done, it has to 
be done. The problem is that Muir isn't going to find housing for 
people who have nowhere else to go. 

Students in apartments have always been allowed to live in 
them over break. They feel they are paying for that month; after 
all, there must be some reason they 're paying so much more than 
market rates in University City. 

This small issue brings up a bigger issue: if a landlord off 
campus anempted to offer a housing contract like the one offered 
to students on-campus, he or she couldn't get away with. Even if 
tenents were found who would accept such terms, the contract 
would probably not stand up legally. 

UCSD is taking advantage of a captive audience, and it is long 
past time for reform. In the meantime, Muir should see that 
displaced students have housing elsewhere on campus. 

The Eighties 

A Decade of Change 
As ]989 and the 1980s crawl towards a close, it's inevitable 

people begin to talk about what the decade meant. As The New 
Republic put it, people will bid to "define the decade." 

But the decade probably hasn't come to an end. Decades don't 
really follow the lines of years; the '50s began with the end of the 
Korean War and ended with the election of Kennedy, the '60s 
really cover the time from the Summer of Love in 1967 to Richard 
Nixon's resignation, and the ' 70s go from Jimmy Carter's elec-
tion to the end of the 1981-82 recession. 

The '80s haven't been defined yet. Some try to characterize 
them as a time of unbridled greed, insider trading, and stock 
market volatility. But this, while it contains some truth, misses a 
lot of things. 

The 1980s have been a time of amazing steps toward democ-
racy around the world. Just in 1989, we have seen Soliq,arity take 
power in Poland, the end of the Berlin Wall, and huge demonstra-
tions throughout Eastern Europe. We have watched the flfst 
struggling steps away from communism in Poland and Hungary, 
and in the heart of the Soviet Union, we have seen unrest. 

The collapse of communism may be the most important event 
in the 1980s, and the new geopolitical order which will form in 
the 1990s is impossible to predict. 

But in the 1980s, we have also seen the condition of inner city 
poor, who are disproportionately people of color, deteriorate to 
new lows. The twin scourges of crime and drugs continue 
unabated, and the politically motivated, poorly executed War on 
Drugs has been ineffective in stopping them. 

People like to break things down into simple explanations. The 
'50s were "Happy Days," a quiet time of surburhan contentment. 
The '60s were the hippie decade. The '70s were the "me" decade. 

So what will the '80s be? It's entirely possible that the com-
plexity of the last decade will defy easy description. Or, the '80s 
may just go down as the Reagan decade, and the beginning of the 
'90s may be marked by the end of the Berlin Wall. 

The 1980s have been a time of social changes around the 
world, and the end of the post-world War II status quo. It may be 
the end of stability, or it may be the beginning of a bright decade 
with expanding freedoms and democracy around the world. 
Thursday's editorial will examine what the 19905 may hold. 

Koala Personal Offensive and Insensitive 
Editor: 

J am a student from Indiana 
University. A friend from UCSD 
sent me a clipping from the Per-
sonals Section of The Koala . 

Basically, the personal was a 
confession to rape perpetrated 
against an intoxicated victim: 

blatant encouragement for rapists 
perpetuates widespread violence 
against women. 

Rape and sexual assault are 
not funny. Trauma, victim-blam-
ing, feelings of shame and fear are 
very real. At least 25 percent of 
the female population experiences 
sexual assault; many men are vic-
tims, and all people suffer from 
the violence and the ambivalence 
of our society. Why do they inten-

sify the problem? Idiots. 
The perpetrator sounds as ifhe 

will continue to prey on vulner-
able women. He needs to be 
stopped. Students should watch 
out for each other, For his sake, he 
needs psychological counseling. 
He is a pathetic example of the 
destructive effects of learned bru-
tality, sexism, and hatred of 
women, 

Michelle Michelson 

"Sorry you were to wasted to 
remember anything." The writer 
flaunts the rape and tells the vic-
tim, " If you ever want to be my 
living blow-up doll again, just let 
me know," clearly playing on the 
myth that women want to be raped, 
(Rape is a violent crime, not a 
sexual issue.)

The appearance of this personal 
i~ infuriating, horrifying, crimi-
nal, and cowardly in more ways 
than I have room to include. My 
first concern is for the survivor of 
the assault, who may recognize 
herself in his heartless descrip-
tion. 

Though this sick man is trying 
to humiliate her further, she should 
know that she is not gUilty. The 
shame he attempts to throw on her 
hangs on him. She deserves to 
care for herself medically and 
psychologically. 

Women's centers, rape crisis 
centers, and mental health serv-
ices are ready to help her. She 
doesn't have to bear hear healing 
alone. 

As for that newspaper, I am 
appalled that they would print an 
open anemptat intimidation made 
by a rapist against a victim. It 
shocks me that they offer them-
selves as a tool of humiliation. 

Editor: 
We have a great transportation 

problem on campus. It is suggested 
to us to use a number of different 
transportation altematives. 

I chose to ride a skateboard. It 
is very convenient, time saving, 
and economical. 

Obviously, it is much faster 
than walking, sometimes even 
quicker that bicycling, as there is 
no need to parle: and lock up a 
skateboard. I just grab my skate-
board and continue on to class. 
With relatively few parts it is easy 
to maintain, and keeps transporta-
tion costs very minimal. 

However, I recently was told 
that skateboarding is prohibited in 
streets and parking lots. This is 
ridiculous. Why? I heard it is 
because we blow by stop signs 
and have no brakes, Why then are 
only skaters singled out? 

That is a little unfair, as I have 
seen many bikers go through stop 
signs at a much faster speed than 
skaters ever attain. As to the false

statement that skaters possess no 
brakes, we have a very reliable 
system: a kick-tail and our feet. 
The same mechanism in which we 
build speed, we can use to slow 
our movement. 

It's very elementary. It is very 
easy to change direction or speed 
to avoid hazards, 

If we can't ride in streets or 
parle:ing lots, where are we able to 
skate? I suppose we are to ride on 
the sidewalks. 

Wait, aren't sidewalks for 
pedestrians? Then are we consid-
ered pedestrians with all the rights 
of pedestrians? Why then are we 
banned from all walkways in 
Revelle, Muir, and Third? These 
are for pedestrians, correct? 

Anotherquestion, what if there 
are no sidewalks? If such a rule 
exists, there should be sidewalks 
for skateboarders wherever there 
are roads. 

When there is a road, but no 
sidewalk, a pedestrian is able to 
walk in the street. I suggest it be 
the same for skateboarders. 

Skateboarding can be a safe 
method of transportation. It isjust 
common sense. Be aware and 
courteous.

GUiknIANCl 

Fear and Loathing in A.S. 
ing in the past months lead me to 
believe we are. 

We all must, eventually, come 
to the conclusion that we are all 
people on a very fundamental 
basis. Who cares what you are? It 
is who you are. You might be 
asking why is this guy preaching 
"kindergarten ethics"? 

More than Copies 
By BRYAN DlAS, Musk Editor 

In this day and age, our society 
is highly civilized and intelligent, 
right? So why is it that we can so 
meticulously attend to detail in 
such things as defense research 
and telev ision news reporting, and 
the things that we are most blind 
to are those which sit right in front 
of our faces? According to some 
statistics, our knowledge doubles 
every decade. Can anyone tell me 
why we fail to see the most funda-
mental roots of our problems? 

Prejudice, in all forms, and the 
whole load of problems that tails 
this issue are still ever-present. 
We may have made some monu-
mental changes with the help of 
such persons as Martin Luther 
King Jr., Susan B. Anthony, and 
Gandhi, but the problem has mu-
tated and, in some ways, become 
worse. We have not even made an 
anempt to listen to what the hu-
manitarian heros of the past have 
tried to teach us. It's sad. 

Now you can accuse me of 
jumping on the bandwagon of "the 
socially aware" or say it's about 
time I pull my head out. That's 
fine. 

But I accuse you all of being as 
guilty as I am. I'm not saying that 
I am some extremely sensitive per-
son and should be put on any sort 
of pedestal for this column. I just 
ask that you hear me out, and 
listen to what I have to say. 

My father's side of my family 
is purely Portugese, and they are 
very proud of their cultural heri-
tage, as am I. Now, being of Por-
tugese descent may not qualify 
me as being a member of a par-
ticularily persecuted race or group. 
But, I know what it is like to be 
proud of one's heritage. 

However, I grew up in white, 
middle class America, the peren-
nial stomping ground of racisn;! 
and sexism. All this does not mean 
I am excluded from racism and 
sexism; to say this would be fool-
ish. 

We are all guilty to some ex-
tent; it's human. I am also not 
saying it's right - we must work 
to change human attitudes, we 
must progress as a race. The first 
step is to stop and take a good look 
at what we are doing here. 

Being an editor for The Guard-
ian and a member of the A.S. 
Council, I have the opportunity to 
see the problems of this campus. 
This year our council has the most 
diverse make-up in years, which 
is great. But we fail to address 
these problems on a face-value 
level. Great fears, emotions, and 
paranoia pervade theairon Coun-
cil. 

On the A.S. Council, there is 
quite a rivalry of sorts between 
certain members of different points 
of view. An amazing paranoia 
exists whenever cenain factions 
of council disagree. People fear 
ulterior motives and flat-out dis-
honesty. 

These fears stem from the 
constantly pointing finger, which 
is looking for new ways to cry 
foul. This self-destructive activity 
threatens to break down all that 
we have strived to achieve as a 
council and a university. 

Constant cries of racism, sex-
ism, and reverse discrimination 
are the first thoughts that strike 
peoples' minds when opposition 

rears its head, These shields we 
constantly throw up when tpe 
going gets tough just end up cre-
ating more distrust and red tape on 
an issue. Not always, but more 
often than not, these accusations 
stem from the unwarranted fear 
and distrust of individuals. 

We need to examine why 
people really think the way they 
do, not what we think their m0-
tives and feelings are. Until we 
accept this basic concept of hu-
man rights and respect, we will 
fail to progress as a group or soci-
ety. 

I choose this scenario, the A.S. 
council, as a metaphor for our 
campus and society as a whole. I 
picked the A.S. because it was 
what brought the problem to a 
head for me. Never have I seen 
such unwarranted and unneces-
sary behavior. 

I like to think we, as a council 
and a society, are not children. But 
all the things I have seen happen-

But like I said earlier, we fail to 
see the basic problems which lie 
under our noses. It takes these 
simple, obvious, and ultimately 
wise teachings to alleviate these 
simple, obvious, and shockingly 
foolish antics. 

Unfortunately, we, as a whole, 
don't have somebody to wake us 
up in the morning. We have to 
take responsibility for ourselves. 
The alann crock of humanity was 
set a long time ago by the funda-
mental principles that our great 
thinkers and doers liad down for 
us to learn from. Are we going to 
wake up, or get caught sleeping 
through the bell?

not blindly though . Check the

moving. 

If at one side already, stay on

Authoritarian socialism has failed almost everywhere, but 
you will not find a single Marxist who will say it has failed 
because it was wrong or impractical. He will say it has 
failed because nobody went far enough with it. So failure 
never proves a myth is wrong.

Editor: 
Recently, I attended a lecture 

on campus about "cultural diver-
sity" given by Carlos Cortez, a 
professor at UC Riverside. 

Just what exactly does "cul-
tural diversity" mean? It can cre-
ate connotations of discrimination 
and integration at the same time. 
But it also can describe the United 
States. 

We are currently in the process 
of a massive integration of differ-
ent cultures. By 2010, the major-
ity in California will be the mi-
norities. Any by 2030, according 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 
number of white Americans will 
increase by 25 percent; black 
Americans by 70 percent; Asian 
and Indian Americans by 80 per-
cent; and Latino Americans by 
190 percent. 

Just what do these numbers 
mean? They mean that California, 
along with the rest of America, is 
in the process of cultural change 

and should start to prepare for it. 
As Dr. Cortez said, our role as 
Americans should "not be paci-
fists in the face of cultural change, 
but activists in the face of cultural 
change." 

Dr. Cortez reminded the audi-
enceof ournational motto in Latin 
which translates: "Out of many, 
one." This should not be just the 
motto of the past, but of the future 
as well. 

We should not close the doors 
to different cultures, but open them 
to the rich diversity they can pro-
vide. Dr. Cortez gave some ex-
amples to show how being cultur-
ally aware can be beneficial. 

A while ago, Chevy launched a 
campaign to sell one of their cars, 
the Nova, in Latin America. What 
they failed to realize is that "va" 
means "go" in Spanish, so what 
they were trying to sell was that 
carthat"didn 't go." Consequently, 
it didn't sell either. 

A little closer to home, just 

req:ntly in California, Sav·ondrug 
stores changed their name to Osco. 
Soon after this, they noticed that 
sales began to drop in certain 
places. 

What they didn ' t notice was 
that the word "Osco" was close to 
the Spanish word "asco," mean-
ing "bitter, disgusting." This could 
make a person a little wary about 
taking "bitter and disgusting" pre-
scription drugs. 

These businesses would have 
benefitted if they were culturally 
aware. Before an openi ng of doors 
to different cultures can happen, 
first there must be an opening of 
minds. 

As an English queen once said: 
"Change must be accepted when 
it can no longer be resisted. "TIle 
change is already occurring, now 
it's up to each individual to accept 
it: not to live in the poverty of 
discrimination, but in the richness 
of cultural diversity.

8 NEWS 

Jesuit priest Mike Mandala spoke in memory of eight people 
who were slain in EI Salvador. 

The U eSD Guardian 

RALLY: Students Protest 
U.S. Aid To EI Salvador 
Continued from page 1 

"So few of us cared to come out 
today ... We don't seem to really 
care," she said. "I would like to tell 
you that I am frightened. because 
the young people of America have 
lost the ability to dream, to 
hope . .. indifference is the real 
crisis here," Ubilla-Arenas said. 

Not all members of the audi-
ence agreed with the views of the 
speakers. In an interview, Anna 
Yatroussio, a second-year Fifth 
College student who has spent 
many summers with her mother's 
family in EI Salvador, said some of 
the speakers presented a biased 
and incomplete view of the situ-
ation in EI Salvador. 

"People are sitting here think-
ing they're getting educated, but 
they're getting educated from one 
side. I don't have a side. I just see 
my country falling apart. Both sides 
have committed atrocities ... 

"The people are living there 
unclerfearofbothsides. They want 

the war to stop," she said. 
Yatroussio added that she did 

not see how a coffee boycott could 
help EI Salvadorans who depend 
on income from coffee companies. 

"I don't see what the boycott is 
going to do ... If it's going to be a 
serious boycott, I think it would 
hurt. That is the main crop going 
out of there- we have nothing 
else to lean on. Who's going to 
profit from the boycott?" 

While Yatroussio feels U.S. 
military aid to EI Salvador should 
stop, she supports U.S. economic 
aid. She also is in favor of negotia-
tion between the warring sides. 

"There needs to be some sort of 
faith in some sort of government, 
or else it's going to tum into worse 
chaos than it already is ... I think 
negotiation needs to start to see 
what will work." 

Yatroussio mentioned that she 
had seen evidence of the war when 
she was in EI Salvador over the 
summer.

"You don't read in the news 
that every day elec tricity goes out

conditions. " 

SUITE 
Continued from page 3 
view the imposition of such secu-
rity measures as curfews- cur-
rently being adopted by some 
midwestern universities- as 
alarming, she did say "I don 'uhink 
[security] will ever get to the point 
that we say we've done enough. 
Security will always be an issue." 

Revelle Resident Dean Tim 
Purpura said that his college re-
cently adopted a policy requiring 
suite doors to remain closed and 
locked during "the evening hours" 
as part of an effort to raise security 
consciousness at Revelle. 

He said the policy was adopted 
approxi mately one week before an 
Oct. 27 sexual assault in which a 
Revelle resident was accosted in 
her room. An intruder entered the 
victim's unlocked room while she 
and her roommate were asleep. 

"At Revelle, we face a different 
problem from Muir," Purpura said, 
"because we face a very heavily-
used bus stop and I'd say three to 
four times per week a security guard 
escorts an illegal alien out [ofthe 
dorms] ... We have a particular 
problem with that." 

Paternalism was not the only 
objection raised to locked suite 
doors. Another concern addressed 
at the town meeting was the pos-
sible impact oflocked doors on the 
ability of students to socialize 

"By having the suite doors 
locked, it is basically locking out 
anyone who's not in that suite, 
which would exclude commuters 
and people who aren 'tliving in the 
dorms," one student said. 

"It'd be really difficult to visit 
people [and] get to be involved 
with the school," the student said. 

A spokesperson from the Muir 
Commuter Council agreed: "It's 
hard [for new students] ... to visit 
people at the beginning of the year, 
and we figured it'd be even harder 
if you're locked out. All they could 
do is sit around in the lounge and 
watch people pass by." 

Although Purpura said that he 
had received "comments from a 
couple of students that we're trying 
to restrict their socialization," he 
said students can socialize by phone 
and have keys to lounge areas 
where they can meet with others. 

"I think these things can be dealt 
with. The thing is, it's not always 
convenient," Purpura said, adding 
that, "For me, I'll sacrifice con-
venience for safety." 

Other students speculated that 
the prospect of locked doors might 
not be resented by incoming stu-
dents whose concerns will be less 
likely to include Muir's past poli-
cies and advised residents to "look 
to the future" and to "not be self-
ish" in lobbying against a locked-
door policy. 

According to Poff, Muir's deans 
will now meet to consider pro-
posed amendments to the policy, 
taking into consideration a budget 
which she characterized as "ex-
tremely complex." 

Poff said Muir residents will be 
informed of a decision through 
posted fliers sometime this week.

Those Who Would Like 
to Rename Third College 
Say Not Much 
• By Jeffrey Yamaguchi, Sla//Writer 

Provost of Third College Cecil Lytle is prepared 
to go to his grave with his college named "Third 
College." However, he is hoping that this will not 
be the case. 

In preparation for Third College's 20th anniver-
sary, the issue of finding a "more meaningful" 
name for the college has come up once again . In 
response, Lytle has appointed a committee to 
advise him on the maner, and on Oct. 24 he sent an 
announcement to the Third College community 
requesting recommendations on the renaming of 
the college. 

"I am asking for a consensus. I'm asking for 
most of us to rally around a name, other than 
'Third.' If it's the case, and I hope it's not, that the 
campus rallies around the name 'Third,' and it's 
proven to me that that is where we want to put our 
investment, then essentially, we' ll j ust drop the 
issue," said Lytle. 

But Lytle is "trying to provoke everyone to 
think about the ramifications" of keeping the name 
of Third College. His concern is the confusion the 
name "Third College" causes in people who do not 
belong to the Third College community, mainly 
students applying to UCSD and the parents of 
those applicants. 

One of the main reasons Lytle has this concern 
is that Fifth College, which is only in its second 
year of existence, has already come close to 
surpassing Third College in the number of first 
choice applicants (UCSD applicants must choose, 
in order of preference, which college they wish to 
attend). 

According to Lytle, "The name is a liability .. . 
As I go around the country . . . to represent the 
interests of Third College, once I explain [Third 
College's program) to the students or the parents, 
they say, 'Well, those are noble ambitions and 
ideals; I think I want to belong to that.' But the 
first question they ask is, 'Why is it called 
"Third"?, 

"I'm asking that we consider a proper name" so 
that the values of Third College will "be readily 
apparent in the name," Lytle said.

Previous Third College Naming 
A Item Met With Conrr"~'Grr' 
·Story By Randy Dotinga, Senior Staff Writer 
and Jeffrey Yamaguchi, Staf!Writer 

Throughout Third College's history, 
the i~sue of naming the college has met 
with controversy and failure. 

Third College, which is approaching 
ils 20th anniversary next year, is currently 
debating whether to change its name. 

"Lumumba·Zapata College" was the 
first name proposed for the college during 
its planning stages in 1969. In a radical 
document called "The Lumumba-Zapata 
Demands," two student groups, the 

Mexican-American Youth Association 
(MA Y A) and the Black Students Union 
(BSU), insisted Ihat the college have a mi-
nority orientation and a focus on the alle-
viation of social problems. They also 
demanded that the college be named 
"Lumumba-Zapata College." 

According to history graduate student 
Vince DeBaca, who was a member of 
MA YA in 1969, the student groups 
wished to name the college after the 
foreign political leade rs Patrice 
Lumumba, a Congolese nationalist in the 

late 19505 and early 1960s, and Emil iano 
Zapata, a Mex ican revol ut ionary in the 
19 1Os, beeau e the two men "were 

•

viewed as martyrs in a cause for justice." • 
"They were not Martin Luther K ing or : Joseflna Lopez

However, the name " Lumumba-Zapata : people and women usually

Continued from page 10 

Third College Council 
Chairperson Paul Lanning said, 
"I was in favor of keeping the 
nante ' Third' up until recently. 
Having listened to the provost 's 
arguments about the recruiting 
factor and so forth , my personal 
feeling is changing . .. my only 
concern is that we build on what 
'Third' already means to the 
people here .. . we don ' t need to 
rename the college just for the 
sake of renaming it or just for the 
sake of getting rid of the name 
'Third. '" 

"We have an outstanding 
program," Lytle said. However, 
"We have a program that defines 
the name. We need a name that 
defines the program," Lytle said. 

Name recommendations, 
which are due in early January, 
have to be backed by a position 
paper "discussing the virtue(s) of 
the suggestion." Those who 
suggest the same name will then 
have to write a joint position 
paper. Each name proposed, 
along with its paper, will be 
published in a special edition of 
the Third Word, the Third 
College newsletter. 

Following the publication of 
these papers, "the committee will 
hold at least one forum to hear 
presentations on the suggested 
names," according to Lytle. 

If a general consensus can be 
reached during the forum(s) , the 
Third College Naming Commit-
tee, made up of five students, 
seven faculty and staff members 
(including Lytle), and one 
alumni representative, will then 
make its recommendation to him, 
Lytle said. If Lytle approves, he 
will then submit the proposed 
name to the campuswide Naming 
Committee, Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, and finally, the UC 
Regents for approval. 

Although voting for a name 
has not been ruled out, Lytle 
believes that past experience 
shows that the number of people 
who vote is not representative of 
a true consensus. 

"I don't want anyone to get 
the impression that I am trying to 
deny students' rights for what 
they want to do, but more 
students would need to vote" in 
an election if it is to be of any· 
use in determining the name, 
Lytle said. 

Lanning explained that the 
Third College Council is 
concerned about how student 
opinion will be represented if a 
vote does not take place, and the 
role that the Naming Committee 
will play in actually deciding on 
a name. 

"At the next forum, I would 
assume, some of the questions 
concerning the process will be 
answered ," Lanning said. 

"We' re in kind of a wait and 
see attitude right now," Lanning 
added.

will "provide a look at life from a

"The majority of the material

"Sometimes he ' ll give a black

History 
Continued from page 10 
in 1974. This time, an eight-
member committee made up of 
students, staff, and faculty 
offered the name of Charles 
Drew, the black developer of 
blood plasma. 

After a year of polls and 
debate, however, the Third 
College Council in 1976 decided 
to not adopt the name "Drew 
College," and instead submitted 
the name "The Third College" to 
a formal vote. Although "The 
Third College" claimed victory, 
due to the closeness of the 
student vote results (112 yes to 
III no) the matter was set aside 
by the council. 

In 1978, yet another name 
vote occured. A preference vote 
between abolitionist Frederick 
Douglass, Martin Luther King, 
Jr., and "Third College" was set 
up by the council. "Third 
College" won the vote, and the 
council forwarded its recommen-
dation to then-Chancellor W.O. 
McElroy. 

But, a few months later, the 
council took back the recommen-
dation, and asked that the matter 
be set aside "for several years." 

A year later, another attempt 
was made to find an official 
name for Third College. But 
then-Provost Joseph Watson 
dropped the issue because a con-
sensus could not be reached, 
current Third Provost Cecil Lytle 
said. 

It was not until 1985 that the 
name "Third College" was offi-
cially adopted. A vole was held 
between "Third College," 
Douglass, and King. "Third Col-
lege" won by a large majority . 
and was approved by the 
campus wide Committee on 
Naming, Chancellor Richard C. 
Atkinson, and the UC Regents.

Sports 
Tritons Edged 7-6 by Cardinal; Finish Sixth at Nationals 

UCSD Gives Stanford a Fight 
By PHll. GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

It nearly happened. 
The UCSD men's water polo 

team played the game of its life on 
Friday nightand nearly came away 
with a win over Stanford in the first 
round of the NCAA National 
Tournament in Indianapolis, Indi-
ana. 

With 25 seconds left in regula-
tion and a 6-6 tie, Stanford scored 
a goal to win 7-6 and earn the right 
to advance to the national semifi-
nals. The Tritons were knocked 
into a consolation game with Ar-
kansas-Little Rock. 

But these Tritons were hardly 
knocked around. 

After Stanford took a 5-4 lead 
at the end of the third period, the 
Tritons managed to tie the game at 
six before it was won with 25 sec-
onds remaining on the clock. 

Jason "Turtle" Brown led the 
Tritons with four goals, while Todd 
Sells and Corbin Walburger each 
added one. J.P. Beay played a 
superb game in the goal, saving 13. 

Stanford went on to face sec-
ond-seeded UC Irvine in 
Saturday's semifinal, but tasted 
defeat by one goal. Irvine met the 
top-seeded Cal Bears in the finals 
and came away with the national 
title by clipping the Bears, 9-8. 

With the loss to Stanford, the 
Tritons found themselves facing 
Arkansas-Little Rock in their first 
consolation game and fell behind 
3-1 early. 

Senior Jason Vance scored four times in Saturday's 10-9 consolation win over Arkansas-Uttle Rock. 

Against Stanford, a team which 
the Tritons have yet to beat in their 
history (they are now 0-11 against 
the Cardinal including an 11-6105S 
earlier this season), UCSD scored 
two first period goals and even led 
3-1 at the half. 

But UCSD fought back behind 
Jason Vance (four goals) and Pete 
McConville (three goals) to edge 
the East Coast team, 9-8. The vic-

PHIL'S ANAL YSIS ... All things considered, tonight's 
matchup is probably the biggest game of the year. Not 
necessarily the most important game of the year, but 
certainly the biggest. Let's face it: this is a big game, 
featuring big time teams. The Giants, at 9-2,lead the NFC 
East by a game and a half. The 4gers, at 9-2, also lead the 
NFC West by a game and a half. A loss by either team 
means that team ... wiu still be in first place. But this 
game is for bragging rights, and the Niners are coming off 
a loss to Green Bay at home which does not exactly make 
them very happy. At all. In fact, the Niners are furious, 
and they could very well tum this game into an embar-
rassment. A big embarrassment. PHIL requires that you ...

Marymount's run-and-gun play-
book, as both UCSD and Kean ran 
and shot numerous times. The 
tearns combined for a frenetic 142 
field goal attempts. 

The Tritons got the better of 
this run-o-rama, converting an 
astonishing 73 percent of their hot 
attempts. Kean heaved up more 
bricks than buckets on the way to 
shooting a somewhat-respectable 
49.5% from the field. 

The teams traded baskets about 
every 10 seconds at the start and, 
with 10:30 remaining in the first 
half, Kean retained a 29-28 edge. 

Over the next eight minutes, 
though, the Tritons allowed the 
Cougars only three field goals 
while tallying 19 points of their 
own. The Tritons' surge was keyed 
by several fast break points and 
strong offensive rebounding by 
Batt and Chris Moore. 

Kean managed to close the gap 
to 62-56 at intermission, and started 
the second half with a 7-\ run to tie

Women's Basketball Wlnlesll st 0-3 

St. Thomas Takes 
Care of Tritons 

By TOM RIZZUTI 
SlajfWriler 

Payback can be tough. 
Three weeks ago, the UCSD 

women's soccer team defeated 
SI. Thomas College in the west-
ern regionals en route to a na-
tional championship. 

The scenario and the outcome 
were both very different on Fri-
day as the SI. Thomas College 
women's basketball team came 
into Triton Gymnasium and, us-
ing a balanced offensive and de-
fensive attack, trounced UCSD 
78-48. UCSO's record dropped 
to 0-3 on the young season. 

The St Thomas Tommies set 
the pace early in the game. Using 
crisp passing and excellent out-
side shooting, they put together 
an early run and led 10-2 before 
Triton Head Coach Judy Malorfe 
called a time out after only three 
minutes of play. 

Malone was impressed with 
SI. Thomas' offense. 

"They beat us inside on our 
man-to-man defense and they hit 
from the outside when we went 
into a zone," she remarked later. 

The Tritons managed to re-
group and basically matched St. 
Thomas for the remainder of the 
half, thanks to the contribution of 
newcomer Lisa Beaver. Beaver 
scored eight of her 10 points in 
the first half, and the team went 
into the locker room trailing by 
11,39-28. 

But the beginning of the sec-
ond half must have seemed like 
deja vu to the Tritons, when St. 
Thomas emerged quickly out of 
the blocks and left ueso too far 
behind to catch up. The Tommies 
baffled the young Tritons with 
quiCk passes, patiently waiting 
for the open shot. And when 
somebody missed a shot, some-
body else was usually there to 
grab an offensive rebound. St. 
Thomas tallied 12 offensive 
boards on the evening. 

Three of those offensive re-
bounds came from senior for-
ward Nikki Haak, who accrued 
game highs in points (20), and 

steals (four). Beaver and Chris 
Ely tied for the Tritons ' team 
high in scoring with 10. 

On defense, the Tommies 
managed to effectively close up 
the inside for the Tritons and force 
them to take long-range shots. St. 
Thomas also forced many UCSD 
mistakes, including 20 turnovers. 

St. Thomas' control under the 
basket is reflected in its 40-22 
advantage in rebounds. Junior 
forward Ellen Hanson led the way 
with II, followed by first year 
center Laurie Trow with seven. 
Cari Young led UCSO with four 
rebounds. 

With 12 minutes remaining in 
the game, the Tritons found them-
selves down by 26. With Beaver 
on the bench with four fouls, 
sophomore guard Kathleen Al-
varez keyed a 8-2 Triton run 
which brought the team to within 
20. But it was too little, too late. 

St. Thomas, led by the ball 
control of senior point guard 
Tricia Domisch (nine assists), 
shut the door down the stretch. 

The Tritons, who have lost 
their first three games of the sea-
son, continue to struggle through 
this rebuilding season. Malone 
cited her team's youth and inex-
perience as its biggest problem 
right now. 

"We're too timid," she stated. 
"We geed to be RlO(e aggressive 
with the ball."

tory continued the National Tour-
nament tradition of West Coast 
water polo control. In the history 
of the National Tournament, an 
East Coast team has never defeated 
a West Coast team. 

This victory marked the Tri-
tons' 21st of the season, a new 
school record. 

The record-breaking year also 
featured UCSD's first-ever trip to 

the NCAA Tournament and its 
highest-ever ranking during the 
regular season (seventh). 

Brown set a single-season 
school record with 85 ejections 
drawn, breaking Dana Greisen's 
record of 84.

the score at 63. 

Unfortunately for Kean, the 
agenda called for the Tritons to 
practice their layup drill. UCSD 
got the ball inside to Gordon 
McNeill and Batt, seizing the 
opportunity to embarrass Cougar 
defenders with a series of baseline 
drives. 

At one point, UCSO's low-post 
players ran the same play six con-
secutive times, all resulting in easy 
scores. This strategy launched 
UCSD on an 18-2 run, giving the 
Tritons an imposing 80-65 lead 
with I3 minutes remaining. 

Kean could not recover from 
this Triton outburst, and the re-
mainder of the contest was a mop-
up session relatively devoid of 
defense. The tearns combined for 
90 points in the last 13 minutes 
alone, and the game ended in a 
126-109 Triton victory. 

In contrast, Friday night's first-
round game .between eventual 
tournament ch8mpion La Verne and 

host UCSD proved to be more of a 
defensive struggle, as the Leop-
ards prevailed 69-66. Neither team 
managed to shoot 40 percent from 
the field, and there seemed to be a 
lid on the Tritons' basket as UCSD 
shot poorly from both the field (36 
percent) and the free throw line (59 
percent). 

Unlike Saturday's game, UCSD 
could not get anything going in-
side against the Leopards, mostly 
because of LaVerne's constant 
double-teaming of Triton post 
players. Rapp, who made the AII-
Tournament team, led the Tritons 
in a losing cause with 17, while 
tournament MVP DeShang 
Weaver helped the Leopards to 
victory with 17 points of his own. 

UCSD Head Coach Tom 
Marshall summed up the weekend 
tournament as a "good experience" 
for the Tritons, but thought his 
team should have beaten La Veme. 
He was particularly frustrated by 
the Tritons' failure to convert at 
the charity stripe.

c laimed. 

Marshall thought the main dif-
ference between the two games 
was that UCSD was able to read 
and react to Kean's defense, but it 
couldn't adjust to LaVerne's ag-
gressive. collapsing zone. 

"[Against LaVerne] our low 
post men didn ' t kick the ball out to 
our guards like they should have. 
[Against Kean] our forwards were 
able to read the defense and ran a 
clinic on offense," Marshall ex-
plained.

3 ON 3 BASKmALL CHAMPIONS 

Th~se tcams arc the survivors. Th~ path to the championship in 3 on 3 
Basketball is one of the most difficult in 1M Sports. The first step for teams is to 
finish with a winning record in their teague. That will advance them to a 
championship poot when: they must beat other teams with similar n:cords. If 
they get out of the pool. the final step is to maltc it through a single elimination 
playoff tournament. Plenty ufopportunities to get knocked off. Th~se three 
teal1l$ had what it rakcs to survive, instincr, gua and a 20·foor jumper. Con-
grarulations arc in order fur rhese teams who were the swvivors and 3 on 3
