Environmentalist Warns Against ~esource Waste 
POPULA1ION BOrtII: Noted author Dr. Paul Ehrlich 
iectw'eS about the root causes of degradation 
By Karen Cheng 
Associate News Editor 
and Ben Boychuk 
Senior Staff Writer 

Dr. Paul Ehrlich addressed UCSD 
students,faculty,andstaffonthegrow-
ing problem of population control in 
!he United States. "Because we are a 
rich nation, !he United States is the 
major destroyer of !he environment," 
he said. 

Ehrlich. who is a Professor of Biol-
ogy at Stanford University, has taught 
there since 1959. He has written and 
co-authored more than 35 books, in-
cluding The PopII/alioll Bomb (1968) 
and The Poplliatioll £\plosioll (1990). 
and over 650 scientific papers and 

articles. 
In an interview, Ehrlichdiscu..-.sed !>Orne 

of the political elements of population 
control. 

"In rich countries, Ihe most important 
thing is government leadership," explained 
Ehrlich. "There is no need for coercion." 

Ehrlich explained Ihat coercion is not 
necessarily the solution in poorer nations, 
either. "If you ~berate women, educate 
them, give them heallh care and access to 
contraception. you wiIJ see lower birth 
rates. The best poor country u ing non-
coercive measures i Costa Rica," he said. 

Ehrlich, who i a registered Republi-
can, said he did not want losee!he govern-
ment impose a large number of regula-
tions to help improve what he sees as a 
major crisis. ' 'I'm not as big on regUlations 

/I ' 

as I was when I was younger," he !.aid. 
"My encountcr!> with regulations have 
further convinced methat we neechome 
other ~tralegy.'· 

While highly critical of Reagan and 
Buh, Ehrlich endorsed a republican 
approach to ~olving Ihe nation's popu-
lation problems. "We need to utilize 
markets in~lead of rules:' he said. "We 
can be mart and lean." 

"We don't want the government to 
come in and plan," explained Ehrli h. 
''The government will screw it up. We 
tried government planning before. It 
didn't work. You don't have to go to 
Eastern Europe to see what a disaster it 
i . We can't afford to try it again." 

Ehrlich also said that the top priority 
should be to restore the nation's declin-
ing education system.

A.S. Meeting Notes 
Co-op Issue - The council discussed plans to avoid the likely court 
bdttle between the univ rSlty and the co-ops Such a battle would 
divert much time and money (rom both parties and away from 
students ' interests. 
A stnke option was sugg sted. as well as the POSSibi lity of the A.S. 
taking over he co-ops under an auxI liary plan for a pertod of one 
year. 
However. according to A.S. PreSident Mike Holmes there are prob-
lems wi th both of these options. Putting the co-ops under the A.S. 
would Involve changing their legal status in a manner which is 
Inconsistent With the Idea o( cooperatives . Holmes does not accept 
tillS alternative because he feels It IS the "oPPOsite direct ion of 
where we want to go." The strike plan might not have a great turnout 
of UCSD students. As one counCil member expressed, "This IS not 
Berke ley. " 

Budget Brief - Th Board of Regents met on September 18 to 
decide budgetary matters. They conSidered the followll1g: 
• Enrollment cuts of 12.000-16.000 students starting 111 1993 
• Reductions In research. administrative. and public service by 
16.000-24.000 employees 
• IncreaSing student fees by $100-$150/ quarter (about a 12 
percent hike) 
• Reductions in faculty and staff (through layoffs. early reti rements. 
etc.) 
• Taking a loan of up to $70 million (rom a priva te source. such as a 
bank. Repayment of thiS loan would come from Increased fees and/ 
or more cu ts. 

PE Department Cuts- A proposal to eliminate the entire physical 
education department is being ci rculated. The proposal suggests 
putting all activities of the PE department under Ath letics and 
Recreation. Although not approved yet. thiS move would result if 
budget problems escalate.

BRIEFLY ••• 
PossibleAlzheimer~sCauseDiscovered 

UCSD researcher Dr. George Glenner may have 
(ound the cause of Alzheimer's disease after more 
than 22 years of work. 

Glenner believes that he has isolated the 
enzyme. called beta amyloid. which is responsible 
for the formation of protein fragments . It is these 
fragments that clump up in brain tissue. creating 
cell-kill ing plaques. which causes memory loss. 

Glenner suffers from an incurable heart 
condition that is caused by the same enzyme that 
he has spent most of hiS life researching. Since 
there is currently no cure for his condition. he is 
aruuous to conclude hiS research on Alzheimer's to 
help others who also have an incurable disease. 

Now that Dr. Glenner has located what he 
believes located IS the source of the disease. he 
can go about finding a cure for it. 

"Information is just pouring out: Glenner said. 
"It's getting more and more exciting every day.-

"Reagan and Bu h set us back far:' 
he said. "They have no policy at all." 

" The United Slates used 10 be the

He had high praise for Democralic 
vice-presidential nominee AI Gore. 
"IHe) i~be"ereducated fontheenviron-

"The idea that someone like him could 
be running for the second highesl office 
in the land is ~tunning. " 

However. he would make no pre-
dictions. "'There is no guaranlee that 
Clinlon and Gore Cart fix the environ" 
mentup. 

We need a World War U level 
commionenlloenvironmenmlsecurity," 
Ehrlich said. 

"A 101 of people have been saying, 
" If you ju~t recycle. everything will be

Because the Uniled Slate~ h~ a 
large popUlation, 3-\ well :1-\ a very high

The Administration Needs 
to Get Its Priorities Straight 

Youd n't havetobe an independent contrJctor to conclude that the old 
Student Center il> falling apart. In fact, the problem~ with the fa ility arc 

vi~ible to the naked eye. The beam which connectthe M!C nd fl of the 
Student enter with the vending machine kiO'>k arc warped and cracking. 
Many of the stairs arc I ..eand in dire neeclof repair. I loles in the balcony 
by the ~tudent organiZ<lIion officcl> arc merely co ered up by sheet, f 
wood. Funhcml re. the miling along that bal ny i~ noticeably I~. 

Given thi~ ~tate of dcteriomtion, it wa\ only a mailer oftiJ11C fore

Given that an independent c I1lmctor found !>eveml violation, of ~le

Director Jim am.Jther\ di~llli~\C~ Wly claim that the facility is un\afe a~ 
"a b\ thim nxliblc rc,pon~ ." one has to wonder how conccmcd ~Ie 
administrntion i~ wi~1 a problem for which it may be rc~ponsible . 

$265.089 i~ allocated 10 the maintcnance of university facilities. If the 
Student enteri~allowed lodetcriomteto thisconditi n,then where i~this 
money going? Obviou~ly. thc Price Center, which i~ arguably the 
admini,ffillion's facility of choice. is well maintained. Perhaps the Student 
Center is not receiving tlle portion of the University enter budget that il 
bolh requires and deserves. 

The University Center also all ate~ well over $4OO,(XX) to housekeep-
ing. Anyone who,pend~evenash rt amount of time at theStudem Center 
can sec the obviou~ neglect. Either the Price Center is re eiving an undue 
share of the hO\L'iCkeeping budget. r the mOlleY allO{tcd to the tudent 
Center is being horribly wasted. 

While fund allation i~certainly ne of tIle culprits behind the Student 
Center\ dilapidation. the main problem lies with tIle administrJlion's 
priorities. As Chris Bumen. University Center Board chair. said ''1l1e 
money's there. It comes down to prioritiz.ing. and tllen going to 
I C,U11Jthers j for final approval." 

It is til11C for the univen.ity administrntionto!>tart gelling it priorities 
Mraight. 1l1e Studcnt enter should be given its proper share of mainte-

One student injured because of faulty prioritizing is too many. Thi 
facility must be repaired before another accident happen. 

Manipulation and the News 
Reporting the news is a nicky enterprise. As an organization charged 

with collecting and reporting fact • a numberoffactors must beconsiclercd 
before a Stol)' sees print. Is tlte ·tol)' relevent? Is it of interest to the 
readership? Who are the intere~ted paI1ies and what is their angle? Is the 

~tol)' itself fair? Are both side presented? 
Above al l else, a news gathering organizati n must guard against 

manipUlation. All too often public relations hucksters wi ll go to preposter-
ous Icngth to have a story covered in a way most favomble to them. Most 
of the time they do get covered. tllOugh perhap not to the glorious extent 
that tlleY had hoped. 

Thus, it was with SOI11C sense of amusement that two editors witnessed 
what amounted to a strategy session by the College Democmts on Monday 
about how to flood the pages oftlle Guardiall with pro-Clinton overage. 
Originally sent to cover what was touted as a mlly. and further inticed by 
a report that San Diego mayoral candidate Peter Navarro would be in 
alleniliU1ce,tl1e editors in tead spent theirtinle listening to how the anlpus 
Clinton campaign organizers had pre-written cOl11J11CntaJies and lellers 
awaiting the signatures of the faithful ready to go. how every loyal College 
Democrat should call and write demanding coverage, and how tl1Cir goal 
was to have a MOl)' in evel)' issue. 

We cover the news. [f one of the major presidential candidates were to 
visit campu ,that would go ill the lOp of the front page. If a campus political 
organization we.re to stage a rally, that may be news as well. But it is not 
news every time theehainnan of the College Democrars sneezes or breaks 
a nail, which seems to be exactly whallhal contingent has in mind. 

In this heated campaign season, campus politics is bound to reach a 
fever piteh.1l1ere are many Slories to teU, and we will strive to teU them as 
fairly, objectively and accurately as possible. But we cantl(){ and wiII flO( 
act as a public relarions brochure for any political organization.

WHY THE DEMOCRATS 
SHOurnVOTEFoRBUSH 

COI'tWttENIARY: Despite his cwooent's claims to the contrary, the president's ideals, 
politics and, most importantly, his last foW' years have "liberal" written allover them 

MAT T 

ROBInSOn 

Why democrats should vote 
for Bush may seem tobeastrange 
headline given thai their candi-
date is so far ahead in the polls. 
But before you put this paper 
down. if you 're a democrat, you 
ought 10 think twice about not 
voting forthe Pre ' iden\. You see, 
the democrat reall y couldn't 
have it any better. With George 
Bush in lhe White House, demo-
crat have been able to have their 
cake and eat il too. 

The facl of the matter is that 
George Bush has given the demo-

crat everything they have wanted, 
and except fora few minortinkerings 
here and there, Bush has nO{ faced 
off against the opposition until only 
recently. And that is, of course. be-
cau~ an election looms. The rJmi-
ficalions for the election season has 
been a cacophony of last minute 
ound bite by Bu h to differentiate 

himself from Bill Clinton. On Ihe 
i sue of taxes. for e)(umple. Bush 
ha come back to a tacit reaffirma-
lion of his previous "no new taxes" 
pledge. But it i ~ clear that he has 
done so only for ~trategic purpo e . 

This fact merely reaffinn that 
nagging suspicion that many have 
held before: Bu h has no real philo-
sophical principle Jfld he cenainly is no conservative. in 
facl. as he digs deep into the pork barrel prost ituting like 
so many others in Washington. he makes more clear his 
embarrassing lack of principles. 

But this lack of principles has been a helpful chess piece 
in the political endgame because Bush has produced almost 
evet)1hing a democral could wish for. I may be wrong here 
because democrats always dream big regardless of the cost in 
money and libeny. So no doubt they still have some 
Fantasyland project IIOl carried out by Bush yet. 

But they can check some things off the wish list, like 
the Civil Rights Act of 1991. a quoca bill; the 1990 Clean 
Air Act, the American with Disabilities Act. the Tax 
Reform of 1990. a hell-of-a-IOl-of regulations and more 
bureaucrats. Bush's recurrent hesitations to do battle with 

Congress make him a democrat's dream: a closet liberal. 
But the facl that hi s is a republican administralion 

makes things so very easy for the democrJtic opposition 
- as we are seeing this election season. Obviously 
anything that goes wrong can be blamed on Bush and 
whatever has seemed important orsignific3nt democrats 
can anribule 10 them elve . Even on something lhat 
seemed as ~mall as raising lu)(ury taxes to tax the rich 
cost blue collar workers jobs and virtually wiped out 
domestic boat production. Ironically. Bush did th is in the 
face of republicall opposition. When that action is 
compounded with similar failed policies and inhibitory 
regulations the result is an e)(acerbated reces ion which 
we have seen monotonously sludging forth . 

Bush was following essentially Democratic policies. 
He led no rigorou opposition and 
even forced republicans to re luc-
tantly join him. Bul democrats are 
able to capitalize on the economy' 
difficulties. pecifically on eco-
nomic programs that have resulted 
in the United States having the high-
est cost of capital in Ihe industrial 
world, and a Federal Register, 
which publishes all proposed new 
federal reg ulations. that reached 
67,000 pages in 1991. That is the 
third highest count in history. In 
fact. in 1991 the federal govem· 
ment spent 22 percent more in real 
dollars on regulatory agenc ies than 

Roger Kuo/ Guan1Ian in President Caner' laSI year. 
We atl know that Bu. h does nOl 

like to do battle with Congress. And this very fact has left 
him impotent in the face of a more truculent Congress - a 
funher reason to keep the Democratic scapegOOl in offICe. 

Bush has blurred those most visible distinctions 
between republicans and democrats. conservatives and 
liberals. Bill Clinton. in addition, has cunningly run a 

.campaign thal preaches a more traditional and moderate 
agenda in order to ween the Reagan Democrats bock to 
the Democratic Pany. Bush' s retort of "til)( and spend," 
"bigger government" and "more regulations" does not 
Slick to Clinton because it applies to Bush also. 

Unfortunately. Clinton has warped the idea thal the 
eight years of Reagan and the four years of Bush are 
really 12 years of the same thing. Lc:IIIS noI pretend.

The ideali IIC meri an ethic of

clearly endorsed by the UC system in 
its financial policie . leaves the bare-
foot with a sense of failure before 
attempt. operating within the con-

to ucceed. 

The answer, many would argue, 
lies in effective leadership. Last 
pring' A.S. election process and 

result, as well as what many correctly 
termed mi representation by campus 
media. contributed to the 10 s of mo-
rale of students of color.

POLITICS? HAND ME THE TYLENOL 
COI'tWttENIARY: Government in this country is enough to make your head hurt 
By Damen Scranton 
Associate Opinion Editor 

I really don 't like politics. Maybe 
it's the hypocrisy. Maybe it's the bu-
reaucracy. Maybe it's the mudsling-
ing or the special interest groups or 
the shameless appeals to the flag-
waving, starry-eyed, middle-Ameri-
can masses. Maybe it's that as a 19-
year-old - forget about the fact that 
I'm a middle-class, African-Ameri-
can environmentalist =- I feel en-
tirely underrepresented. Maybe it's 
just a bit of everything. 

Anyway,Iwokcuptheothermom-
ing and said to myself, "Since you're 
now the associate opinion editor of a 
nationally renowned college newspa-
per, you'd better get to like, know 
and, most imponantly, respect poli-
tics." So I watched 'The Mclaughlin 
Group" (which i actually a lot fun -
nier than the "Saturday Night Live" 
~ketch), I read Bill Clinton' "Putting 
People First" pamphlet and I rented 
Ross Perot's nO{·so-difficuIHo-find-
extra-copie -of-anymore campaign 
video. Then I came 10 a startling con-
clusion - I really don 't like politic . 

Okay. Scratch liking politic . I'll 

just get to know and respect politics. 
So I read, in one evening, the Deela-
rationoflndependence, the U.S. Con-
stitution. the Bill of Rights, the Ar-
ticles of Confederation and a book in 
thechildren's section of Super-Duper 
Crown entitled Geuing fa Know YOllr 
Government. When [ finished, not 
only was J utterly more confused than 
when I had started, but I had a head-
ache this big that had anicles, sec-
tions, sub-c1auses, Roman numerals 
and fine print written all over it. Plus 
I had spilled OJ on the Constitution. I 
think that's some kind of a felony. 

So it was respect or nothing. I 
asked myself: Can I respect a Con-
gress \hat caters primarily to the wants 
of speeial interest groups and that is 
comprised primarilyofwealthy, while 
men who are three times my age, 
twice my weight and seem to possess 
about half of my logic and motiva-
tion? Can I re peet a governor and a 
state assembly who will let We The 
Peopledie in overcrowded emergency 
rooms and under-funded trauma cen-
ters while they bicker over which 
additional public services to cut and 
which special intere t groups not to 

offend? Can [ respecl a president who 
tarted a war over oil and now won't 

lift a finger for humanity, who calls 
himself the "Envi ronmental Presi-
dent"tolhechagrin of the SPOiled owl 
and the advocates of the environmen-
tal summit. and who made a few too 
many promises four years ago and 
has decided to remedy that by wussing 
out of presidential debates in 1992? 
Can I respect a presidential candidate 
who cheated on his wife. who may 
have dodged the draft and plays sax 
gigs to muster suppon? And finall y, 
can I possibly respect two candidates 
who are calling for change yet are 
sending the same perfumed messages 
composed by the same behind-the-
scenes dramatists in the same tongue-
in-cheek fashion? 

No. 
And neither can a lot of people-

that is one of the fundam ental prob-
lems with American politic~. Gener-
ally speaking, We The People do not 
like politics. We The People do not 
knolV politic~ and We The People do 
not respect politics. And I have a 
pretty good idea that the fee ling is

rebuttal time. 

"r m di!>Uppointed in the way the 
Administnltion has been dealing with 
Ihe students. I feel patronized ... I'm 
upsetthat [Ihe administration) can go so 
far as to deny every effort of students to 
oblain a little more control over their 
facilities and boards," Burnett said. 

According toBumett.studentswould 
be able to hear all ides. as well as know 
the dew.ils. historical facts and issues in 
order to express their views, provide 
greater input and have some impact on 
the situation. 

According to UeB Director Jim 
Carruthers. the proposed forum would 
deserve some looking into. "[The idea 
of a forum) was proposed indepen-
dently. Someobjectivisrn is very healthy. 
and I think we need to know a bit more 
about what's going on." Carruthers alMl 

~id he wou ld take pan in the forum ifil 
helped students to bener understand the 
issues. 

Issues addressed would include the 
cooOp's srotus as a tudent organization. 
autonomy for student govemment and 
whether students have a say in control 
over educational processes. 

Each ludent pays $37.50 a quaner 
to the UCB. which in tum funds student 
organizations. according to Bumett. At

I n response to the co-ops' occupa-

lion of the onh Conference Room \;l,t 
Monday, Bumett says thaI the UCB has 
, upponed the co-ops in every level. 

"We allocaled the onh Confer-
ence Room to the co-op on June I , and 
historically. il has been the ca.<;/! to stick 
by the fact that we are re:.pon.,ible for 
allocalUlg campus space ... we felt it 
was a legitimate allocation." he ~id. 

"It is clear on the UCB charter that 
we are responsible for allocating pace 

a.~. there is no mention of sign:ttory 
oversight." Bumett added. 

According to Burnett . one of the 
reasons the co-ops are having so much 
trouble is becau~ of the status of the 
UCB itself, "as the UCB seems to be 
defined solely by oneorlWoadministm-
tors." 

As faras pending legal action. Burnen 
said that the UCB has been trying to 
obtain an attorney. 

··Wehave been uying toget a lawyer 
since February. The board is funded by 
ludent fee:" $37.50 a quaner, per tu-

dent, and we feel that the money shou ld 
be controlled by ~tudents at some level 
and should not be arbitnuily restricted 
on the basis of administrJtive oversight 
or any other interests." Bumett said. 

The tudents voted last year that 
student govemance boards would be 
able to hire outside independent legal 
counsel to ensure that student's rights 
are respected. docurnent.> wilh the uni-

BUSH: The President 
i a dream come true for 
the Democratic Party 
Continued from page 4 

This eleclion has always been a 
referendum on George Bush and his 
po licie .. The principles Ihat Bush mn 
on in 1988 were made of Ihefabric of 
Reagan' s coanail;,. BUI his allegiance 
to,>uch principle~ wa;,only lip service 
- as his tax pledge makes so clear. 

Both candidate have been double-
talking lireles;,ly and in thelinal analy-
,b. il is doublful we will gel anylhing 
different until Congress and the 
American people change. The next 
few years will see a difference and it 
wi ll nOI be because of Clinlon. What 
i'> ~ignificant is Ihal Congress is los-

ing over 200 members. which will 
mean greater fiscal responsibility. 

The problem b, of course, thaI 
with CI inton we have someone enter-
ing the While House who is con-
firmed in his optimi;.m about the effi-
cacy of govemment power and obvi-
ously believes in the >pendthrift in-
vincibility of government to solve 
problem. 

BUI when democratic poli 'ie, fi -
nally reach fruition, we will get a final 
ac ountingofwhat policb have been 
running the country the lasl four years. 
The change vaunted by democrats 
will not be so novel. But al least we 
can blame it on somebody new. And 
that i~ change. 

It is in 19% when we will have a 
real battle of idea~ and explore the 
possibilities of change.

Men~s Soccer Snaps. Losing Streak 
By Art Root 
Associate spons Editor 

The UCSD men's socCer team is 
backontrack.ln a warof attrition played 
in 100 degree heal. the Tritons beat 1llC 
Masler'sCoUege, 2-1, a1 Newhall.1llC 
road victory snapped UCSO's three-
game losing streak. 

"My God. it was probably the hOI-
test we've ever played in," Head Coach 
Derek Annstrong said. 

The heat took a severe toll on the 
Tritons. Annstrong was forced toshuf!1e 
his lineup and use his bench to spell his 
weary staI1er.>. 

"We suffered a few injuries today. 
When they get tired. injuries occur. 
Fonunately, we didn't have any dehy-
drJlion problems. We kept them pretty 
full of water," Annstrong said. 

"We battled pretty well considering 
the heat. It was a good l'C>ull" 

Sophomore forward MaLt Chilton 
scored both goals for the Tritons. Nick 
Terlccky and Sergio Salvador set up 
Chilton's two scores. 

The Tritons needed a confidence 
booster heading into th is weekend's 
Grand Canyon Tournament, where they 
wi ll face regional powers GrJnd Can-
yon and Metro Stale 

The win improved UCSO's record 
to 5-3- 1.

Maybe you've seen Pete 
Taylor's "art car" around La Jolla 
and the beach areas. Better yet. 
maybe you 've seen it outside the 
Grove Gallery 00 campus. How 
could you have missed the vehicle 
with all the knick-Macks attached 
to it? 

Taylor's van, 
better known as 
"Hodgepodge," Is 
complerely CO'Med 
with found or 
"rescued" objects, 
rangq from plastic 

Hullunan~ 
figures to small 
religious trinkets. 1t is 
part of a larger 
exhibit entitled 
"Personal Visions, .. 
which is on display at 

the Grove Gallery through October 
24th. 

The exhibit, which features 
approximately 15 artists, some of 
whom have gained national 
recognition, contains work that has 
been called "folk" or · outsider" art, 
terms which refer to artists who 

dedicated a whole section to 
Annette Funicello because, after all, 
"everybody likes Annette." The 
whole piece has a personal theme 
to it, as we!1 as a broader one which 
addresses the importance of pop 
art from the '50s. It is set up to 
look like a .. Jeopardy!" set, with TV 
screens and categories, yet it still 
maintains the overriding theme of 
Annette and her beach blanket 
friends. While part of the exhibit is 
based on Annette' s history, each 
part of the piece has a deeper 
meaning for D'Andrea, as there are 
representations of his life 
throughout. 

Patrick Davis ' "Street People" 
are wonderfully animated sculptures 
with exaggerated postures and tiny, 
thin extremities that make them 
look as If they are dancing. "I make 
the hats first, the rest just comes to 
me," Davis has said. Most of his 
figures wear disproportionately large 
headdresses in brilliant. camivaHike 
colors. Davis uses heavy paper tor 
the bases of the bodies and then 
covers them with pages from 
magazines like National 

October 1, 1992 

The genre is of an. 

eccentric or religious 

nature and is 

represented by a 

variety of 

mixed media. 

Artists with visions - no training required 

The exhibit contains 

work that has /Ne1'( !tt 

called '101lt' an, 
-

have not been formally trained at 
tradit ional art SChools. The genre is 
of an eccentric or religious nature 
and is represented by a variety of 
mixed media. 

Four of the artists featured -
Howard Finster, Mose Tolliver, 
Patrick Davis and Mamie Deschillie 
- have been documented in the 
Museum of American Folk Art 
Encyclopedia of 20th Century Folk 
Art and Mists. Taylor's van has 
been shown In a documentary film 
called Wild Kiheels, a tribute to art 
cars and their owners' love of them. 

One of the works being 
presented is a prophetic piece by 
Howard Finster. It is one of many 
paintings that contain Biblical 
gJessa,ges which he has called 
;:;~r.rm(lf'I ail" Finster said he began 

after the lord spoke to 
to paint His word 
"pre~ don't do much 
one listens - but a 
~:;:~Icdi.lets painted OIl a brain 

CiI~jPbster uses any material at

_ ... .,n of the Bible. His 
pIecea .. often portrayals of Jesus

"'-._·Id "HuI8IInIt." O'AndIM 

Geographic. He paints over only the 
faces, arms and legs, because the 
magazine provides much of the 
color for his work. 

Stephen Huneck pokes fun at 
the corporate work ethic with his 
.lCEO Wall Cupboard,· a painted 
wood piece. "My art is about feeling 
good,· Huneck has said. Function • 
comes f irst in this piece and in the 
majority of Huneck's work. 
Alongside his ·Cupboard," and 
many of his other works, he has 
created a sculpture of a man 
whose briefcase serves as a shelf 
for a FAX machine. 

The exhibit also includes the 
Simple, poster·like piece entitled 
"Nail," by Mose Tolliver, 8 man who 
attributes his painting to an 
accident that left him on crutcl1es 
for an extended period. Tolliver, who 
began painting at the urging of a 
friend, fulfills his fantasies in his 
work, depicting eccentric images 
with a colorful flair. He cranks 
out as many as ten paintings 
a day because, as he has 
said, "if it took me more than 
an hour to finish a picture, I 
wouldn't paint."

icons of that ~ene. Playscool is now in its

What one can expect of Playscool i al-

incarnation. you will be in the midst of indoor 
Bunjee jumpers. a juggler who used to per-
foml on the Ed Sullivan show. a circus see-

reputation from the beginning. Zweig is the 
proud creator of the only truly succe ful 
clubs that are available to hipsters under the

Mistress is a Second-rate PlaY. 
I Star-studded film directed by Barry Primus criticizes Hollywood movie industry 
By Michael A. Schwartz 
Staff Writer 

The premises for movies tend to come in 
wave .. One idea does extremely well at the 
box office. and !.uddenly identical film!. fol -
low. Now. on the heeb of Tile Pluyer. Robert 
Altman 's satire of the Hollywood movie in-
dustry.come~a new movie about h wevilthe 
film bu~iness is. 

Mis(re!>.I' follows the w~hed-up artiMi 
life of a ~creenwrite r. Marvin Landism.m. 
R bert Wuhl , adead ringer for Albert Br b , 
plays the cynical former filmmaker now re-
duced to produ ing in~tructional video ... . To 
,tart things off. he recei es a phone call from 
Ja k Roth (Martin Landau ). a fonner great 
producer al!-. fallen from the band wag n. 

This phone call initiates a !.erie. of meet-
ings in re~taurJnt after restaurant wi th an on-
his-way-up college kid who i:-. working a. .. a 
<,cri pt consultant. He pr udly proclaim, that 
he studied with pielberg' ~ former profes-

In contrast to The Player. this i~ ground-

he ha ... to c mpromi~e hi!. art to get his film 
projec t made. With ut giving a\ ay the end-

about his money than the script. and the mo ie

an axe to grind against the industry. but the 
airing out of his grudge cannot fuel an 
audience's entertainment alone. 

The ondi ti n that surround an artl t at-
tempting to get produced come a ro s well 
with the disgusting and self-interested char-

hi girlfriend to have the lead role. Eli Wallach 
plays a wealthy formerc1ock store owner who

suicide of a painter unable to fit in with 
society, his script ~ to be his great 
catharsis. However, this notion falls ap-t 
as he agrees to more and more alterations 
in the script; he changes from .tist to 
pimp while making his own movie mistress.

s if to break up the repeti tion of meeting 
all these mi!:>tre. se und men. a brief glimpse 
is given IOtO Landi~man 's passion for th is 
particulur sc ript. He feel s re~ponsible for the 
!.u icide (on-camem) of the lead actor in his lust 
great film. ince his new film denb with the 

suicide of a painter unable to fit in with 
society. his script appears to be hi~ great 
catharsis. However, this notion falls apart as 
he agrees to more and more alterations in the 

ript; he changes from arti t to pimp while 
making his own movie mistress. Unf~rtu­
nately. no further revelation are given into 
why he so readily consents to these change. 

TIle only real ten ion in the story i quickly 
disposed of without any real explanation. At 
first. it seems likely that Landisman himself 
will commit !>uicide. However. when the 
moment arrives. an image of the actor's sui-
cide fl ashe., across the screen. and he puts the 
pills down. Rather than filling him wi th guilt 
and forcing him to down the pills. the idea of 
committing !.uicide leaves him and the sub-
ject is dropped. 

Beverly .l11istre~s of producernumberthree, 
de erve kudos for being the only remotely 
il1lere!.ling character in the film. Played by 
Sheryl Lee Ralph. Beverly is fiercely devoted 
to the art that she feels is trapped in.,ide of her 
and is not so quick to sell out a., the men that 
surround her. 

Mis(ress is not a bad film. but a tedious 
one. The movie has no arc at all. The charac-
ters start low and end low. and they are far 
from exciting or dynamic along the way. 
Apart from an oc 'a 'ional chuckle. it's prob-
ably a better choice to sit out this latest Holly-
wood-makes-artisl. -compromi e-thei r-vi -
sion-and-is-a-work -of-the-devi I genre of fi 1m.
