..---D,.I Mar Election -----------------~....., 

Student Group Attacks 
Del Mar Council Majority 

An informal group of UCSD students is supporting 
two candidates in the March 5 Del Mar city council 
election . 'Students for Heinnzman and Westerwick' 
(SHW) has already begun to canvass students in an 
attempt to discover the nature of Del Mar Community 
issues. 

The new group is backing Jan Heinnzman, a UCSD 
graduate student and Bob Westerwick, a University of 
Colorado graduate who works as an engineer. They are 
cooperating to win the two council seats up for election 
this year . 

SHW feels a primary issue in the campaign is the 
unresponsiveness of the current council majority. 
According to SHW workers, the present majority, 
backed by a group called 'Friends of Del Mar', has spent 
days at a time discussing irrelevancies while neglecting 
the real issues in Del Mar, such as street conditions afld 
crime. SHW also believes the possibility that two more 
members of this group could be elected with the 
inevitable political machine developing " in what is 
supposed to be nonpartisan city government." 

The Heinnzman-Westerwick forces are stressing what 
they feel the community issues are : better law en-
forcement to help curb the rising tide of bike and stereo 
thefts, pressure on the contractors and the city manager 
to improve street conditions, and the need for 
cooperation to protect the Del Mar environment. 

SHW feels the Friends of Del Mar consider en-
vironment the only issue. This group, backing can-
didates Nancy Hoover and John Weare, " wishes to buy 
up all unoccupied land in Del Mar. Financed by a 
possible reassessment in tax rates, SWH believes this 
proposal could send rent rates flying and force students 
from Del Mar." 

SLDM: Open Space ~d 
Control of City Growth 

'rhe Students for a Liveable Del Mar (SLDM) 
organization has given its formal endorsement to the 
campaigns of John Weare and Nancy Hoover, both 
candidates for the March 5 City Council election . 

In supporting Weare and Hoover, members of SLDM 
telt that Del Mar is being " snowed under by the gran-
diose schemes of major developers" and that the 
present City Council is not taking a firm enough stand 
against this "barrage". Open space preservation and 
better control of high density growth have been two 
major issues stressed by Weare and Hoover. 

An independent poll taken in Del Mar last June in-
dicated a wide disparity between citizen attitudes and 
the City Council's position on growth . 

In the poll , 73% of those questioned saw themselves 
in favor of restricting growth, 73% saw the average 
citizen in favor of restricting growth, but only 37% felt 
the City Council was in favor of restricting growth. 

This poll , which concluded that "the citizenry per-
ceive a future deterioration of the quality of life in 
Del Mar," reflects, according to Keeling, "the necessity 
for electing new local officials willing to implement 
controls over building and over-development." 

Weare, a UCSD chemistry professor and Member of 
the Ad Hoc Committee on the University Town Center, 
resigned his chairmanship of the Friends of Del Mar in 
order to run for City Council. Nancy Hoover is executive 
assistant for Psychology Today and vice-president of the 
Del Mar Civic Association . Weare and Hoover botr. 
served on the Del Mar Downtown Study Group.

Glen D. Mitchel : 'Pray for Alllerica' 
by James G. Soto 

His theme IS "Pray for 
America." He plans to 
rep lace official cocktail 
parties in Sacramento with 
prayer meetings. Glenn D. 
Mitchel of EI Cajon is 
running for the Republican 
nomination for governor of 
Ca lifornia. 

. 

This is the first in a series 
of features on gubernatorial 
and senatorial candidates. 
The Triton Times hopes to 
contact all the candidates 
by the June primary. 

and deacon, is running for 
governor because "with all 

the corruption in the last 
two years we need to get 
our nation back to God." 

The major issues of the 
upcoming campaign are 
seen by Mitchel as 
" reestablishing Christian 
principles, capital punish-
ment, Christian education, 
and Abortion , pornography, 
and drugs. 

Mitchel said that we 
should teach the 10 
Commandments in the 
High Schools . He is " against 
sex education as such but 
rather we should be 
teaching moral principles." 

Mitchel's Support 

Mitchel typified his 
campaign as " a grass roots 
movement." The basis for 
his financial support comes 
from one, five, and ten 
dollar contributions. His 
largest co ntributions , 
according to Campaign 
Manager Jay Waller "have 
been four or five $100 
contributions . Mitchel put 

~5000 of his own money 
into the campaign . 

Mitchel thinks his 
campaign will take about 
$500,000 to make it through 
the primary but now is 
running about S5000 in the 
r..n 

His candidacy is being 
supported by numerous 
religious groups including 
1 he 900 Evangelical 
("'urches in Ca lifornia as

commentator Dr. Vernpn. 
Magee, and people from 
the Oral Roberts and 
Katherine Kuhlman

-SOme Real Experience' 
by Roberta Rehm 

Junior and sen ior 
students, majoring in Urban 
and Rural Studies (URS) 
have been interning in 
actual community projects 
for the past three quarters. 

A total of 30 U RS 
students, including eight 
this quarter, have taken part 
i n the program . Bill 
Siembieda, Field Studies 
Co-ordinator, commented 
in a recent interview, "They 
can get some real world 
experience to test against 
some of the things they've 
been reading in books." 

Among the ap-
proximately 20 field 
positions open to the 
students are U.S. Senator 
John Tunney's Office, the 
Model Cities Project, S.D. 
Youth Services, the Camp 
Pendleton Natural 
Resources Office and the 
offices of S.D. City Council -
persons Maureen O'Connor 
and Jim Bates. 

According to a November 
1973 report on the project, 
by Siembieda, " One 
positive way to assist in the 
acquisition of skills is to 
provide off-campus roles 
for students which require 
them to sort through the 
institutional settings and 
grapple with difficult 
problems in the field ." 

"The students, once they 
get into field placements, a 
number of them want to 
continue. Sometimes they 
work into jobs for them-
selves," stated Siembieda. 
Several students who served 
in the intern program have 
been offered permanent 
jobs after graduation . 

When students take a 
field studies position they 
are expected to spend a 
minimum of ten hours per 
week on the job. At the end 
of each quarter they write a 
paper detailing their work 
and any insights they have 
gained from the experience . 
For this the students 
receives four credits and a 
grade. A small stipend is 
also available for some 
jobs. 

All URS majors must take 
at least four units of URS 
196, Field Studies, and may 
take up to 16 units if they 
wish . 

A follow-up to the field 
stud ies program is in -
corporated into the URS 
curriculum, in the form of a 
senior seminar. All URS 
se niors participate after 
they have served their field 
internship. The purpose of 
the seminar is to share their 
experiences and to relate 
them to an academic 
research paper. 

" We've had really 
positive feedback, 
generally, " Siembieda 
reports . Problems have 
developed only when 
students were not fully 
oriented in their positions 
or were not sure what was 
expected of them. For that 
reason , the " Mutual 
Agreement Rule" has been 
formulated . This rule states 
that " the student, the 
sponsoring field 
organization and the URS 
faculty must be satisfied 
that the program of work 
activities will be mutually 
beneficial. " 

Participating field 
agenc ies must meet several 
requirements , including 
defining a work task for 
students , providing 
supervision, being willing to 
meet with URS faculty 
members to report on 
program progress and 
providing compensation for 
any 0 ut-of-t he-ord i nary 
expen es students may 
incur in working for them 

Hetore enrolling as an 
Intern , students must 
establ ish a solid academiC 
background for the ir 
project by taking several 
URS courses. 

Field posi tions fall into 
one o f three catagorie . 

1. Public organizations, 
such as ci ty and county 
departments . 

2. Publi c i nterest 
organ izations, such as Legal 
Aid and the Urban League. 

3. Detailed field research 
study , sponsored by 
University faculty or a 
public or pr ivate 
organization . 

In the first two 
categories, students may 
work at the operating level 
with c lients , the ad-
ministrative level , or at the 
program management/ -
development level . 

Mitchel , 57, is an 
Oklahoman native who 
owns a real estate company 
in San Diego's East County .• 
A member of the Southern 
Baptist Church, Mitchel 
believes the major cam-
paign issue is "getting the 
nation back to God." 

On the ecology, he 
believes that of course we 
shculd have clean air but 
that most pollution is in 
peoples minds. He believes 
that for example "abortion 
is pre-meditated murder, 
especially three months or 
more after conception ." 

City Children Face Malnourishment 
Though Mitchell is 

prominent in state religious 
Circles, he has not held 
public office before. In 
1972 he ran for the San 
Diego County Board of 
Supervisors but failed to 
make it through the 
primaries . 

Mitchel's campaign is not 
supported by any political 
faction in the Republican 
party . In fact Mitchell 
claims he will refuse any 
support from any politically 
oriented organization . 
When ,,§ked what his is 
constuency Mitchel said, 
" I've been supported by 
C hristian people 
throughout the state and by 
non-Christians fed up with 
corruption and are ready to 
throw out the people in 
government. " 

Mitchel, a bible teacher 

As Governor, Mitchel 
would "have stronger anti-
pornography laws. He is 
strongly against drugs. His 
own son, Bill, was on dope 
for nine years and tried to 
take his own life. Mitchel 
says "my son found Jesus 
Christ and may soon join 
my campaign talking to 
young people." Bill plans to 
write a book about his 
exper iences. 

He plans "to reduce 
soaring property taxes by 
separating them from the 
school system." Mitchel 
said he would finance the 
schools by a higher tax on 
liquor and tobacco, in-
creased sales taxes and a 
hilher income tax on 
corporations.

Thousands of children in San Diego r.ounty are in 
danger of brain damage due to malr:Jourishment, 
according to a recent UCSD student project. 

This study, initially funded by CALPIRC, con-
cluded that these individuals will "get off to a poorer 
start" and this may "have profound consequences" 
for later achievement. These conclusions are based 
on a malnutrition project done by 14 UCSD students . 

The project funded by CALPIRC began as an at-
tempt to learn "whether there are children whose 
nutrition is so deficient that their brain development 
is impeded". Two professors, Dr. Robert B. livingston 
and Dr. A. Baird Hastings, agreed to help with a 199 
study project in this field . 

The students researched all the existing literature 
on the subject to understand the effects of 
nutritional deficiencies . Though clear in animals, 
where other factors can be fixed, it had not been 
resolved with respect to humans. To continue the 
study they obtained a President's Fellowship from 
the Regents. 

To learn the effect on humans, the group obtained 
raw data of nutritional intake by age group for 10 
states from the Centf'r for DiSt>a~f' ontrol in Georgia 
This combined with personal interviews, hospital 
records and data from the Head Start program 
enabled the groups to come to grips with the

Pass-Fail May Hurt 
(CPS)-A recent survey indicates undergrad~ates with 

more than 10% of their courses graded on a pass-fail 
basis will be disadvantaged when applying to graduate 
and professional schools. 

According to the Ed~cational Record. the survey also 
indicated students wit ~ majority of pass-fail courses 
will also face difficulties in transferring to other schools, 
obtaining fiAancial aid, and finding employment. 

Nationwide admissions officers expressed general 
agreement with the survey's findings and noted a 
preference for graded course work . One at Harvard said, 
"I?ass-fail grades ... are of no help to us. We don't even try 
to evaluate them." 

Solzhenitsyn and Detente 
(Charlotte Saikowski Christian Science Monitor) 
What now for Soviet-American detente? 

The judgment of many observors here (Washington) 
is that while the dramatic banishment of Russian writer 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn will ripple the waters of 
detente, the uproar will eventually simmer down and 
the process of improving relations will go on . 

American officials suggest that precisely because of 
detente the Kremlin has gambled on the more humane 
path of expulsion rather than imprisonment of the 
world-renowned Nobel Prize winner. Clearly it hopes to 
mute both Western crit icism and Mr. Solzhenitsyn's 
effectiveness as a cri tic of the regime . 

" Perhaps the Russians are progressing to the point of 
the 1930's when they exiled people and may get back to 
czarist times when they were really progressive and let 
people go," commented one official wrily . He pointed 
to reports that other Soviet dissidents may be given 
visas to leave the country. 

There seems little doubt that the exile of Mr. 
Solzhenitsyn will induce many Americans to question 
anew the value of dOing business with a country that 
acts arbitrarily against its citizens. 

Rodents Romp at USIU 
(USIU International News) USIU is rustic - where else 

would you find a snake bite kit in the Information 
Center? - and being in the country has its disad-
vantages, (USIU is located approximately 10 miles East 
of UCSD), as several Alpha residents know only too 
well . 

Building 35 has become the prime target for field 
mice, which abound in the area . They get in 
everywhere, eat everything, and appear impervious to 
rat poison . 

"We've been sleeping in the living room because 
they're living under my bed," one girl said . "They've 
chewed up everything from candy to plastic - including 
my terrarium plants ." 

Following the apparent failure of "O-Con" (a com-
mercial rodent poison) given out by the Resident 
Assistant, Maintenance was ca lled in and traps were set. 

"We've caught two so far," said one resident, "and it 
looks like they're staying away for awhile. Maybe it 
scared therr off." 

The Courty Health Dept. had little to comment on 
the mice, '~xcept to say that they have brochures 
available 01 how to cope with them.

save as much as $30, according to a recent CALPIRG 
survey. For a normal visit (including two X-rays, a 
cleaning and an examination) prices can vary as much 
as 300% in our area. 

The California Public I .. terest Research Group

complaints about the lack of information on dentists. 
Students with dental problems only receive the names 
of two local dentists from the Campus Health Service.

Editorial 

Hitchhiking Sticker 
A recent letter by Steve Carpenter (Feb. 12) made an 

excellent suggestion which, if implemented, could 
make hitchhiking much safer for students, especially for 
women. The suggestion was, that along with a student 
1.0. card, the registrar should issue to students a special 
student car sticker that could be placed in the lower 
right corner of the student's windshield. This would 
indicate to prospective hitchhikers that they were 
accepting a ride from a fellow-student . If women 
students were to accept rides from only such cars or 
from othel' women, their chances of being molested 
would decline considerably. 

The cost involved in carrying out this plan would be 
insignificant when compared to the gain in safety for 
women students who needed to hitchhike. The Triton 
Times therefore urges its adoption. Any students who 
wish to help push this ' plan through the proper 
bureaucratic channels should contact Mark McCarty at 
the Triton Times. 

TRIUMPH 

The Solzhenitsyn Phenomenon 
by Jerome Katsell 

Alexander Solzhenitsyn the 1970 Nobel Prize 
Laureate in Literature passed his formative years in the 
Rostov-on-Don region in poverty with his widowed 
mother. An excellent aptitude for mathematics and 
physics won him a Stalin scholarship for post-graduate 
studies at Rostov University. In addition he took a 
correspondence course from the Moscow Institute of 
Philosophy, Literature and History which he completed 
in 1941. He fought as an artillery officer in World War" . 
At this time Solzhenitsyn was a "true believer" not only 
in the social-philosophical system of communism, but 
in its just administration . He has emerged from this 
most unlikely background of early personal beliefs into 
being a champion of ethical reform within the Soviet 
Union. Even in the 1940's Solzhenitsyn did have severe 
doubts about Stalin and was arrested in 1945 for in-
decorous, thinly veiled remarks aimed at the "Leader of 
Peoples" included in letters to a fellow officer. He was 
finally released from prison and exile only in 1956. 

The experience of injustice, of prison , of the whole 
terrible unexpiated agony of the Soviet period has 
become the central focus of Solzhenitsyn's fiction and 
non-fiction. In stories , novels and in his most recent 
literary-documentary· work Gulag Archipelaao: 1918-
1956, Solzhenitsyn relentlessly pursues an expose of the 
dehumanized values of his country's rulers and their 
bureaucratic flunkeys . He views himself as a creative 
historical witness, a role sorely needed by all those who 
touched by the system of native concentration camps 
which have been so pervasive on the Soviet scene, and, 
yet, so suppressed. 

Solzhenitsyn's literary debut was almost as incredible 
as his incarceration . In 1962 Nikita Krushchev per-
sonally sponsored the publication of One Day in the 
Life of Ivan Denisovich in an attempt to further 
besmirch Stalin and his "cult of personality." But the 
great United Nations shoe beater had opened a Pan-
dora's box which continues to be a nasty thorn in the' 
side of officially sponsored -interpretations of recent 
history . Fulfilling a deep need in the Russian people to 
publically bring forth the truth of the heinous historical 
injustice which has been perpetrated upon it, One 
Day_ .. met with resounding popular acclamation . The 
Krushchev faction of the Party soon realized its mistake; 
the novella was taken out of circu lation and eventually

removed from library shelves . Although he had lost all 
official public outlets, Solzhenitsyn's work continued to 
be circulated in typewritten manuscript form within the 
borders of the Soviet Union and was smuggled to the 
West. Fint Circle and Cancer Ward appeared first in the 
original from Russian emigre publishers and then in 
translation . The same is true of excerpts from his most 
recent, incomplete novel AUBust 1914. 

GuiaB ArchipelaBo; 191~1956 (to be published in 
English translation by Harper and Row in April of this 
year) is the culmination point so far of Solzhenitsyn as 
historical witness. The literary artifice of the novels is 
almost completely abandoned to a documentary ac-
count of the history of Soviet penal institutions through 
1956. Excerpts from Gulal ... appeared here first in the 
New York Times, December 29, 30, and 31 . The book is 
dedicated to " ... those who did not live to tell it. " It is a 
detailed history of the overall apparatus of official 
though unacknowledged repression in the four decades 
following 1918. The inception of the system is attributed 
to the Party's icon, Vladimir I . lenin, a fact of which it is 
anathema to mention in official circles. Th e Soviet news 
agency TASS has branded Gulag ... a "blanket slander of 
the Soviet people. " Solzhenitsyn had been working on 
his documentary for many years and had it completed 
by the early 1960's. He withheld publication until now 
for fear of reprisals to former prisoners mentioned in the 
book . Solzhenitsyn does not simply trust to his memory 
of events, but interviewed some 227 former prisoners. It 
is the wrathful indignation, the defiance, the hatred and 
will to redemption, the expose of moral bankruptcy at 
all levels in the system felt in Solzhenitsyn's writing 
which take the book beyond the mere documentary 
detail with which it is sated, and make of it a movingly 
mournful prayer for rebirth from los5 of human dignity 
and from the incredible waste of talent and potential 
suffered by the peoples of the Soviet Union. 

As a literary artist Solzhenitsyn's antecedents are 
essentially Russian . His novels combine the realistic, 
historical and polyphonically evolved epiG6 of Tolstoy 
on .the one hand, and the philosophically searching, 
psychological thrillers of Dostoevsky on the other. He is 
not altogether free of the general tendency in Soviet 
fiction to deemphasize character development at the 
expense of didactic dialogue. It is perhaps in his shorter 
works-One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisoyich, 
"Matryona's Home," and the prose poems called etudes-
-that Solzhenitsyn's literary reputation will endure. In 
these there is conc,atenated a judicious use of telling 
detail and artistic economy that make them truly 
memorable. 

Solzhenitsyn's dedication to his own culture and the 
historic truth of that culture leads him to reject current 
trends in the West in terms of the ideas and literary 
preoccupations or programs. While he welcomes and is

Perversion 
Editor : 

This newspaper is an 
abortion . The Trjton Times 
has finally succeeded in 
degrading itself to new lows 
in the history of journalism. 
The editorial page, under 
the dictatorship of Mark 
McCarty, has over the past 
year degenerated into 
satire, stupidity, and 
worthlessness . Having a 
superficial aquaintance 
wi th Mr. McCarty, I can 
only suspect that his 
meglomaniac tendencies, 
pumped with the power of 
editorship, have run 
rampant--Ieading to this 
exhibitionistic display of his 
inner perversion and 
decadence. Mr. McCarty 
(alias Percy Byssche) has 
outdone himself th is time 
with "On the Necessity of 
Masturbation". Mr. Mc-
Carty can be enlightening, 
for example his final 
paragraph : " Develop an 
.expanded sensuality : learn 
an exquisite gentleness . 
Cherish values of personal 
warmth, i ntimacy and 
contact. Be free in your 
expression, but never in-
sincere." But why must he 
couch such advice in such 
an absurd format? To begin 
an article with a flippant 
title and an equally satirical 
introduction sets the tone 
at comedy; not sincerity 
and depth . 

Is this the purpose of an 
editorial pag~to make us 
.lUnt for somethin~ of value 
amid witless satire and 
inane humor disguised as 
literary garbage? The 

editorial page would be 
better used in its originally 
intended function--to 
exam i ne trends in the 
University ; to submit 
changes and recom-
mendations for changes to 
the readership ; to offer an 
intelligent analysis and 
commentary of happenings 
both at UCSD and in the 
outside world (whatever 
that is). 

Grow out of your in-
fanti Ie approach to the 
editorial page, Mr. Mc-
Carty. Stop wasting paper 
with your drivel , and we 
can stop wasting our time 
reading it l Quit discussing 
your personal degeneracies 
and perversions in the 
format of the editorial 
page! Don't publ ish any 
more of your pornography 
in our paper! Instead, mail 
it to me in a plain brown 
envelope.

Alfven Hall 
Editor : 

I should like to pose the 
question as to why, with 
three Nobel laureates on 
(or formerly on) the faculty 
of U.e.S.D. we have a Urey 
Hall, a Mayer Hall, but no 
" Alfven Hall." It would 
seem to me quite ap-
propriate to re-name the

Threepenny Opera 

The Threepenny Opera, which is the current 
main stage production at the. Old Globe Theatre, 
is billed as "an opera for beggars". The street 
singer who opens the show with the "Ballad of 
Mack the Knife" sets the mood for a great show. 
But the rest of the first act attempts to live up to 
its subtitle . 

The "loft" orchestra (since the Globe is sans pit) 
was bad. The action was slow. The movement was 
stilted . The dialogue delivery was sloppy. And 
Mack the Knife was terrible, Scott Chamberlain 
being the worst offender in all of these areas . 

What amazed me most about the production 
was the way it steadily improved through the 
following acts. Perhaps it is the fact that it is yet 
early in the run, and it takes a full act for the 
performers to acquire the timing and assurance 
necessary for this difficult melodramatic musical -
comedy tragedy . 

The third scene of act one returns to the 
beggar's outfitting shop of J.J. and Mrs. Peachum, 
Polly's (Mack's "wife") parents . The Peachum's are 
played respectively by Norval B. Radar, P~iscilla 
Allen, and Elizabeth Kopache. Although the 
second scene was mildly humorous, and the only 
really discordant note was Mr. Chamberlain, the 
third scene started the play moving . 

Mr. Radar and Ms. Allen have voices well suited 
not only for nle"~"nt ~m~ing, but fcr the roguish

Warren Burt's tribute to the

composition which utilizes 
automated mixing of 16 
sine-wave oscillators. 

Describing his in-
volvement in music as 
socially oriented, Morgan 
said " I conceived this piece 
as a mirror-tool Nhich 
anybody who would care to 
go through the process(es) 
stated in the score could 
used to involve their own 
ears and aesthet ics---
i.e.,e.g. growth from the 
inside, i .e . expanded 
consciousness through 
personal involvement (read 
feedback). " 

It seems like The Exorcist and Jim Croce are the two 
most talked about phenomena in the entertainment 
industry. Croce's first LP, You Don't Mess Around With 
Jim 'remains no. 1 on Record World charts after four 
weeks at the top. It was first released nearly a year ago, 
and ' 

20th Century Fox is test-marketing a re-release of The 
Last American Hero under the new title I Got a Name. 
The new title is taken from the Jim Croce hit, penned by 
Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel, in the hope that the 
popularity of the tune will increase interest in the film . 

The long-rumored west coast answer to last summer's 
highly successful Watkins Glen concert appears now 
near reality. Negotiations have been completed bet-
ween the management of suburban L.A .'s Ontario 
Motor Speedway and Watkins Clen promoters Shelley 
Finkel and Jim Kaplik, result ing in the tentative 
schedul ing of a one-<lay outdoor concert for this 
summer's Memorial Day weekend. Further info about 
the "who, where and when?" of this event will be passed 
on as it becomes available . 

Johnny Winter opens a more than 30 city tour on 
March 1, in Jacksonville, Florida . The tour coincides 
with the release of Johnny's sixth Columbia LP, Saints 
and Sinners, and the RIAA certification of his first gold 
record for the album Johnny Winter And Live. 

Teddy Slatus , Winter's tour manager commented that 
" the entire show will be based upon the concept of 
black with a continuation and improvement of the 
innov'ative use of lighting that was employed on prior 
Johnny Winter tours to emphasize Johnny's inimitable 
stage charisma ." 

Winter plays the San Diego Sports Arena on March 
28 . 

"Here's looking at 'you' kid." 
Yours truly journeys to "si n city" February 18 for

To commemorate the event, the ballroom of the 
Century Plaza Hotel has been converted into a replica 
of Rick's Cafe Americana (of Warner Brothers' 
Casablanca fame). complete with gaming tables, a 
Dooley Wilson look-alike, the works . 

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, on a recent visit to Nash-

ville presented Roy Acuff with a gold record for his perf~rmance on their best-selling album Will the Circle 
be Unbroken. Dirt Band and Circle producer Bill 
McEuen expressed his appreciation for Acuff's 
wi lIingness to assist at the sessions at a time when a " lot 
of people were more concerned with the length of our 
hair than with the fact that we wanted to make music." 

Capricorn Records has announced the signing ot 
former Epic artist Elvin Bishop to a long-term contract. 
Elvin is scheduled to begin work on his first Capricorn 
album in mid-March at the Capricorn Sound Studios in 
Macon. The sessions will be produced by Allman 
Brothers producer Johnny Sandlin.

his ear cocked toward the speaker in the famous Victor 
advertisements of long ago, receives 1) a choice of any

ween dog and speaker read, "His master's voice."

be dropped into the "doggy box" at the Triton Times

to give your name and phone number Good Luck-! 

"We aren't in any way 
trying to threaten or replace 
the old music" said Warren 
Burt, another member of 
the group. " In fact, the 
simple truth of the matter is 
that the musical activities 
of both concert hall and 
sports arena are for our 
purposes, mostly irrelevant. 
What we are trying to do is 
enlarge, through the use of 
technology, the vocabulary 
of new and elegant sound 
experiences available to us . 
To offer, in effect an 
alternative music to the 
ones, both popular and 
claSSical, which our culture 
has handed down to us ."

Satisfying! 

Hungry BB Team Nips Fresno 
The UCSD basketball 
team convinced the fans 
last Saturday nlte of 
something they knew 
already. That Is that they 
should be occupying 
first place In the NAIA 
Northern Division. They 
defeated the top-ranked 
team - Fresno Pacific -
by a score of 66-63 In a 
close, n8'rYOUs game for 
all participants and fans 
alike - except of course 
for Steve Higgins and 
Paul Trainer. 

The game wasn't 
basketball, It was 
reminiscent of a free 
Thanksgiving dinner or 
Christmas . All who 
participated tried to 
outdo the other men On 
the floo r with their 
generosity . Each team 
attempted to give the 
game to the other 
through a variety of 
turnovers while Fresno 
Pac i fic successfully 
gave UCSD a variety of 

elbows Inflicting bruised 
bones and bodies. This 
was their downfall, 
however as UCSD tumed 
these fouls around to 
beat Fresno at the line. 

The game started out 
close and remained that 
way through most of the 
first half. Fresno Pacific 
led most of the way but 
not by more than 4 
points. UCSD picked up 
In the last two minutes 
and went to the dressing 
room sporting a 33-29 
halftime lead. The first 
half was marked with 
balanced scoring shown 
by the fact that seven of 
the 10 starters had 6 or 7 
points, while everyone 
had less. 

UCSD quickly lost 
that lead In the second 
half. Fresno was 
shooting atrociously but 
UCSD couldn 't capitalize 
due to blunderous 
basketball and poor shot 
selection. Except for a

The UC San Diego baseball team opened its 1974 

season on a less than ausp icious note as they were 
skunked by Cal ifornia State University, Fullerton 11-0 
last Friday. 

The Tritons' new uniforms added a dimension of 
excitement and class to the game out on UCSD's· (how 
do you get there?) home diamond. But it was Fullerton 
who provided the action as they scored seven runs in 
the fi rst two innings. They cranked out several extra-
base hits during the course of the game, including a 
home run by their catcher. Both teams exhibited some 
sharp fielding, especially on turning over a couple of 
double plays. 

Bob Moss' umpires handled the game with Bill 
Schaiere taking 0 '1 the job behind the plate. S~Ping 
out in style with ed shirts, red socks, and red & white 
hats, the men fOlmally called by the name "BI " did 
quite a job. . 

UCSD has the talent to provide good baseball action. 
So, if you are a fa ., . hop in a Land Rover and travel over 
the terrain east of t~e Mdllllt:vv5 Campus ~')(Ter field, to 
watch Coach Lyl ~ Olson's men perform between the

Pap j;, TrifQf'l T'me. February 19, 1974 

fantastic block by 
George Calhoun, the 
game looked absolutely 
pitiful. George - stan-
ding 6'3" - managed 
somehow to leap high 
Into the air and swat 
away the layup attempt 
of a man fully 4 Inches 
taller. 

About this time UCSD 
started playing 
basketball and stretched 
the lead to eight pOints. 
They couldn't break the 
game open largely 
because of their own 

mistakes and the fine 
shooting of Fresno's 
Dave Barnett . This 
player came off the 
bench to score 12 points 
- all In the second half -
to keep Fresno In the 
game. 

UCSD managed to 
fritter away their lead -
due to a Fresno press 
and their own Inept ball 
handling - until It was 
only 1 point with 1 : 23 
left In the game. At this 
juncture a Jump ball was 
called and UCSD 

controlled the tip. They 
brought the ball down 
the floor and Steve 
Higgins was fouled 
sending him to the line 
for a one and one. 
Chewing his gum he 
calmly canned the first 
but missed the second. 

Higgins was also at 
the line with 17 seconds 
remaining and a one 
point lead . and 
proceeded to make two 
free throws ala Jerry 
West. 

Joe Colt had a fI ne 

game collecting a game 
high 20 rebounds and 15 
points - this against a 
starting Fresno Pacific 
lineup of 6'7", 6'S", 6'5", 
6'4" and 6'4". Paul 
Trainer had 11 rebounds 
and 16 pOints, Including 
some crucial buckets In 
the waning minutes of 
the second half . Higgins 
finished with 9 points 
Mark Read added 6 
points and Jim Slvllll 
and Steve Kircher each 
added 4 pOints to round 
ou1 the scoring.

Tennis Team 
To Open Tour' 

The men's tennis team 
recently started their 1974 
season with a great deal of 
new talent as well as 
returning veterans on the 
courts. Coach Tad 
Yamaguchi feels these 
freshmen are providing a 
challenging atmosphere 
for the team in rivaling the 
upperclassmen. 

Although there are 26 
members of the team, 
Coach Yamaguchi uses 
only a dozen for each 
match . These are usually 
the top twelve, a roster 
which changes with each 
match. 

Currently in the number 
one spot is freshman Nick 
White. An up and coming 
'tennis player, Nick was 
nationally ranked in the 16 
years and under league. 
Alternating between first 
and second is Bill Duke. 
Being with the team for 
three years. Bi II is valued 
as one of the top regulars -
a mainstay of the team. 
Kurt Fistrup, another 
regular, is known to be 
one of the better juniors in 
the Bay Area . Presently 
placed in fourth positiol') 
is Angel Lopez, a fresh-
man with a natural affinity 
for tennis. Jack Taufik, a 
transfer from Bucknell, 
has an unusual on·the-
court philosophy of trying 
to mentally upset his 
opponent. Completing the 
singles in sixth position is 
Skip Schink, a sophomore 
top ranked in northern 
California . 

Sophomore Mark 
Massman is a strong 
player expected by his 
coach to become a 
valuable player with more 
time and experience . 
Ordinarily playing first 
doubles with Skip, Shack 
Fisher is a challenging 
freshman , ranked in 
northern California . Shack 
is strongest in his nasty 
TOP SPIN SERVE. Another 
regular tournament player 
is freshman Tony Pena, 
placed ninth on the team . 

Slow Week 

Tony Lopez and Richard 
Freer are two team 
members with good solid 
foundations as tennis 
players with great 
potential . A good hard 
hitting freshman , Tim 
Fosdick, plays mostly 
doubles; as does Jeff 
Sweetser, also a top fresh-
man . Ranked in the 
Minnesota state finals two 
years in a row, Jeff is a 
promising athlete. 

The Tritons started their 
tennis season a week ago 
with a disappointing bout 
against USD - a team 
composed of only 
nationally ranked players 
who took UCSD at ~. 
The very next afternoon 
the Tritons walked all over 
La Veme at 8-1. But in the 
latest away match at 
SDSU, tbey were han-
dicappe~ without top 
players Nick and Bill. 
Consequently, the score 
ran 9-0 in favor of the 
wrong team. 

Friday the Tritons took 
Southwestern College in 
spite of the fact that their 
No. 1 and No. 4 players 
were out of the line up. 
Coach Yamaguchi felt his 
team, playing as expected, 
was generally stronger 
t~an the opponent . 

I n the first singles, Bill 
Duke played a confident 
match at &-0, o-D. Playing 
a similarly strong two sets, 
Kurt Fristrup scored 6-4, 0-
3 in the second Singles. 
Skip Schink and Tony 
Lopez easi ly won their 
matches, w,hile An gel 
Lopez and Tony Pena 
played close sets . The first 
two doubles , Schink-
Fisher and Fosdick-Freer, 
were easy wins. The third 
and last doubles match 
was a tight one which 
would have gone into an 
exciting third set if the 
team had been given 
priority over a reserved 
court . The match had to 
end in a tie, bringing the 
final score to 7'h - 1 Vz .

Solzhen itsyn continued from pale 3 Physicist to Address TM Group 
gratified by the support he has received from western 
organizations and individuals (the German Nobel Prize 
winner Heinrich Mil is an example), Solzhenitsyn is 
indignant at the moral turpitude rampant in the West. 
His recent statements concerning the culpability of 
both political parties in the Watergate scandals testifies 
to this. In 1970 Solzhenitsyn was given an opportunity 
to collect his Nobel Prize, but he refused because of a 
rumor that he would not be allowed to return to Russia. 

continued from pate ] 

Alfven, Professor of Applied 
PhYSics. Perhaps the Triton 
Times could promote this 
suggestion if they find it 
reasonable . I do not 
pretend that this is an 
important issue - but it 
would be nice. 
Joe Freeman 
Grad Student, Physics 

This Wednesday Feb. 20, Dr. Paul 
Levine will speak in the Informal Lounge 
on Revelle at 7:30 pm. Dr. Levine is a 
physiCist who traveled to India in 1970 
where he became a Teacher of TRAN-
SCENDENTAL MEDITATION after 
studying for 3 months with Maharishi 
Mahesh Yogi. He has been teaching and 
lecturing throughout California and 
Arizona and is also the Coordinator for 
the SIMS Institute for Advanced Studies 
on TM 

person can attend 4 short sessions of 
instruction and learn to meditate on his 
own. The 1st Lecture will cover the vast 
area of benefits that any person prac-· 
tieing TM will experience in the first few ' 
days. Increased clarity of mind, less 
stress and fatigue, more energy, more 
creativity, better health, and more 
happiness in daily life. 

While his literary style might not satisfy modem 
sophisticates in the West, Solzhenitsyn's search for an 
ethical foundation on which to build the future cannot 
help but find a responsive cord within us. His search to 
find the historical roots of his country's modern political 
and moral dilemmas is a search that will have to be 
taken at some time here, and throughout the world if we 
are to survive. Solzhenitsyn serves the high calling of 
unblinking truth in art, and while we may quarrel with 
his form, the expression of truth is powerful. 

Dr. Levine emphasizes that TM is a 
practical TECHNIQUE and NOT a 
Religion, Philosophy, or Ideology. " It is 
something we 00 that has subtle but 

The lecture will be the 1st of two fantast ic results ." For further information 
introductory lectures after which a call 296-5742. 

Solzhenitsyn has stated .that when a country has a 
great writer it is like having two governments. The 
government of Solzhenitsyn is fragile; it needs whatever 
support we can give. It goes without saying that this is 
especially true since he has once again been arrested 
and now deported to Germany. This, given 
Solzhenitsyn's intense dedication to his country, may 
destroy him. In one of his ~tudes, speaking momentarily 
and with fierce irony in the name of Soviet J)olitical 
cadres who have brought millions to their graves, 
Solzhenitsyn writes. "We, we. you see, will never die'" 
This is, of course, a delusion, but the ethical revolution 
which Solzhenitsyn has set rolling, drawing adherents 
from the cream of Russian intellectual life, will never 
cease if Russia is to live, if the world is to survive in 
dignity. 

Visitors Banned 

From Building Sites 
Construction site v is its 

now have been officially 
outlawed for anyone not 
following the rules set forth 
in Policy and Procedure 
Manual issuance 420-80. 
Those with a legitimate 
need to visit a construction 
project site must review and 
follow the PPM instruction . 

The reason for the new 
policy, according to Vice 
Chancellor H .. D. Johnson, is 
to minimize the exposure of 
personnel to hazardous 
conditions and to limit the 
University's exposure to 
liability actions. University 
personnel , faculty , 
students, staff employees, 
and guests or visitors to the 
campus must have the 
approval of the Campus 
Architect or the Physical 
Plant Admin istrator before 
entering sites . 

Construction project sites 

are defined as " all areas 
involved in construction 
activities external to 
buildings as well as any 
areas within buildings 
undergoing alteration or 
new construction ." 

The manual outlines the 
procedures to be taken for 
those with a need to visit a 
site. It also delineates the 
responsibilities of those 
involved in the visits . 
Unauthorized visitors will 
" 1) be escorted off the site 
and asked for iden-
tification ; 2) be reported by 
the construction contractor 
to the Campus Ar-
chitect/Physical Plant 
Administrator or · their 
respective designate; 3) be 
reported by campus Ar-
chitect/Physical Plant 
Administrator to Vice 
Chancellor - Business and 
Finance." 

More Teeth continued from pale 2 
and a cleaning ranged from S17 to S40 or SSO. These 
prices are rough, and of course do not in any way 
measure the convenience or quality of the dentist's 
service. But they do give students an idea of the going 
rates in this area. 

CALPIRG produced a brochure to further explain the 
survey and give names and addresses of low .... riced 
dentists. These can be picked up at the Muir FiShbowl, 
The Co-op Book Exchange and the Co-op Auto Exchange 
at Revelle. Also the Health Center at Third College will 
have copies of the survey. 

In addition surveys will be mailed out from the 
CALPIRG downtown office. To obtain a copy, send a 
stamped, self-addressed envelope to CALPIRG, Dentist 
Survey, 1660 India Street, San Diego, California, 92101. 
For further information, call 236-1509. 

Filler 
This Article is be ing written at Po insetta Printers in 

downtown Solana Beach (Such as it is) . Poinsetta 
Printers is housed in a squat green build ing that lacks 
any sort of aesthet ic appeal. But we like it here. ". 

The Article is being typed on the back of a blue Bike-
for-Life" sign-up sheet. They want people to sponsor 
other people to ride bicycles in order to collect money 
for the Del Mar Save-a-Life Committee . Cliff Robertson 
is the General Chairman of the committee . 

The office where the article is being written is yellow. 
There is a lady sitting in the corner. 

If you haven't guessed already, the sole purpose of 
The Article is to fill a space that would otherWise be 
blessedly empty. Unfortunately, the accepted mores of 
journalism hold that empty spaces are not valid means 
of dissiminating information. Thus, The Article. 

It fills a space approximately two 19 pica columns by 
five inches. The headline, which is set in 24 pt. Bodonl 
bold, reads "Filler ." Both the headline and The Article 
are completely useless. . 

There is only one way to assure that you will not have 
to read humorless, shallow trash like this again in .the 
Triton Times . Come in and talk to City editor Greg t:llCks 
about joining the newswriting staff, or BUSiness 
Manager Rue Hinton about working as an ad 
salesperson. . . . 

It is a ni ce day today. The sun was ollt, but It IS gOing 
down now. The lady left five minutes ago. 

Wilderness Course Offered Again 
Contemporary Issu-es 20, The 

Wilderness, will be offered again this 
spring. In additidn to two lectures per 
week students will be involved in special 
interest sections which will be led by 
those students who designed the course. 
The sections will explore areas such as 
natural art fOfms, Indian cultures, natural 
history. values and significance, etc . 
etc . The class will be culminated with a 

week long outing after finals week. 
A meeting for all those interested will 

be held Wed., Feb. 20 at 7:30 p.m. in 
conference room 111A in the Chancelors 
complex. Sign ups for the class will start 
that evening and further sign ups will be 
held at the c.1. office, H&SS, and the 
Wilderness Studies office in the brown 
bag room at Muir. The class will require a 
dept. stamp.

ticipate fully in important play and learning ex-
periences that contribute to the development of 
sensorimotor skills, language acquisition and the 
foundation of tools for th inking and coping," ac-
cording to the study. 

"The overall consequence is that a malnourished 
child may be handicapped by many encumbering 
conditions of which his diet is a key factor. It is 
therefore likely that a child, so handicapped, will get 
off to a poorer start than he wou Id otherwise and that 
this may have profound consequences for his 
achievements in school and throughout life." 

The students in the study felt that the project was 
worthwh ile and relevan t. Unlike some other classes 
that they had taken, the subject was real and im-
portant to them. In fact many of those involved have 
since decided upon careers related to malnutrition.
