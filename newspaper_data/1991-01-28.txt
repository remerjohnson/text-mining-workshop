The tradition of serving beer at 
UCSD'sFriday aftemoonTG events 
has been declared illegal by the 
California Department of Alcoholic 
Beverage Control (ABC). 

AccordingtoaJan.17 ABC letter 
to TG Committee Chair Nick 
Aguilar, serving beer at an event 
open to the public requires a liquor 
license. The A sociated Students, 
which pon ors the TGs, cannot 
obtain a license because it is a stu-
dent organization. 

But A.S. Pre ident John Ed on 
said the ruling does not mean the 
end of the I5-year tradition. 

"It's not total defeat," he said. 
According to the ABC ruling, 

the integration of drinking and un-
derage tudent does not po e a le-
gal problem. It is becau e people not 

that serving alcohol is illegal. 
Edson aid he is currently 

searching for a new location where 
the public would not be able to mix 
with UCSDstudents and employee . 
With that modification, TGs would 
be legal again.

Div.11 Move Among Issues 
Pondered by Athletic Officials 
• IRAAC to hold two open forums, 
seeks input from campus community 
By Phil Gruen 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Intercollegiate and Recre-
ational Athletics Advi ory Com-
mittee (IRAAC) will be holding two 
open forums next month to hear 
views which could help shape the 
future of UCSD' intercollegiate 
athletic program. 

Discu sioncould ultimately lead 
to consideration of a move from the 
NCAA's non-scholarship Division 
III to Division II, the latter of which 
permits financial as i tance for its 
student -athletes. 

Judy SweeT, ' _TCSD's athletic 
d:n..:tor and an "ex-officio" but non-
voting member of IRAAC, tre sed 
that the main objective of the com-
mittee is "to get people fully in-
formed on the issues. [lRAAC] is 
interested in hearing from the great-
est number of people on campu on 
their views of the athletic program." 

IRAAC, which con ists of five 
faculty members and four tudent 
representatives as mandated by the 
NCAA for collegiate athletic advi-
sory committees, will hold a forum 
focused toward students at Warren 
Lecture Hall on Feb. 6 at 4:30 p.m. 
A forum directed towards faculty 
and staff will be held on Feb. 13 at 
4:30 p.m. at the same location. As of 
press time, the exact room number 
was not available. 

IRAAC Chair and Associate 
Professor of Medicine Diana 
Marquardt, who said that the 
committee's goal "is to try and hear 
as much as possible [before making 
a recommendation]" explained that 
both meetings are open to anybody, 
but their focuses will'be different. 

IRAAC has been looking into 
new directions for the Athletic De-
partment since last April, when Vice 
Cbancellor of Undergraduate M-
fairs Joseph Watson and other ad-
ministrators requested an update on 

the tatus of the program. Watson 
aid that there has been "con tant 

discus ion [about a po ible divi-
sional change for UCSD' athletic 
program] ... this i something that 
has been evolving for a number of 
year ." 

Watson aid he has not imposed 
a deadline upon the committee to 
agree on a recommendation, ex-
plaining that it is crucial for infor-
mation to be absorbed from all 
segments of the campus before a 
recommrntfation is made. At that 
pomt, he said, the recommendation 
would be brought to Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson, whom he 
speculated would bring the is ue 
back to the campus community. 

"[Watson] told IRAAC to take 
whatever time is necessary to do 
this right," Sweet said. "But I think 
the committee wants to figure this 
out by the end of the [academic] 
year." 

The primary is ue that has arisen 
in the meetings is that of cheduling, 
according to Sweet and Sports In-
formation Director Bill Gannon. 
Both explained that it i becoming 
increasingly more difficult for 
UCSD to schedule games with other 
Division III opponent'i, citing in 
particular UCSD's large student 
population and the fact that the 
school is not in a conference. 

With over 14,000 undergraduate 
students, UCSD is among the top 10 
Division III schools in student 
population. According to the 1989 
version of UCSD's Revised Long 
Range Development Plan, the 
campus will have a total student 
population of nearly 26,OOOstudenlS 
by the year 2005. 

As the campus has grown, the 
overall excellence of UCSD's 
intercollegiate teams in Division ill 
competition has flourished. But the

Schnurer indicated that the TG 

tradition include the band • the al-
cohol, and the location at the hump. 

"In order to ave two of the tra-
dition , we have to sacrifice th 
location," he aid. 

New location under con ider-
ation by Edson include the Price 
Center and a ite near the Matthew 
Admini trative Complex. No new 
location ha been approved. 

The TG will not exist in their 
present form even at a new I ation. 
Edson aid. At the Price Center. for 
example. events would have to be-
gin later so those working in the area 
won't be disturbed. 

Ed on aid even if the new lo-
cation conforms to the ABC deci-
sion. it would be up to UCSD Police 
Chief John Anderson to approve the 
arrangements. Anderson has to agree 

to the ecurity measures. 
Anderson first brought up afety 

objections concerning the TGs in a 
letter to Edson on Sept. 17. As a 
result, a committee was formed to 
di cu and decide on alcohol-re-
lated i sues at TG . 

The TG committee ent a letter 
to the ABC a king for an opinion on 
the legality of the TGs. 

In hi letter to Edson, Anderson 
cited drunk driving a "the leading 
cau e of death among those 18 to 24 
years old." He al 0 wrote that "over 
the eight year I have been at UCSD, 
property damage, noise complaints • 
arre t • and injuries have occurred 
becau e of the TG ." 

Edson said he has worked to 
improve ecurity and has argued the 
legality of the TGs, and claims 
Anderson has overestimated the

War Protesters Send Signal 
With 'Sleep-in' at Library 
By Amy Shuba 
Guardian Reporter 

A small but dedicated group of 40 
to 45 students, all members of the 
UCSD Alliance for Peace, continues 
to hold a vigil in front of Galbraith Hall 
as a constant rerninderofthe war in the 
Persian Gulf. 

Group members say that their aim 
is to be a source of information and 
support for those who are confused 
about the war or who have family 
members in the Middle East Some 
members have pledged to continue 
their vigil until the troops come horne. 

"Protesting is not unpatriotic, we're 
just expressing our views," said Mark. 
Williams, a Muir College jwtior. 

"We're not advocating a violent 
overthrow of the gOVenunerlt, "he said 
"The only thing we're advocating is 
questioning the government, getting 
all the infonnation, and making your 
own decisions." 

"I do love my country and I want to 

stay but I wanttomakesomechanges," 
said group member 1. P. Montagne. 

Montagne said he wants to "dispel 
the myth that we're all just hippies." 

"We 'renotthrowbocks to the '60s," 
Montagne said. "We're here because 
we're upset about what's going on." 

Both Williams and Montagne 
emphasized the idea that the vigil i for

Current and Former Israel EAP Students Express Concern 
• Education Abroad Program will decide the future of this year's students by February 15 
By Rachel Blackburn 
Staff Writer 

UCSD tudentswhothoughtthey 
would be spending the entire 1990-
91 academic year in Israel have 
returned 10 the Uniled Stales be-
cause of the danger of Iraqi attacks. 
As they await a decision from lhe 
Education Abroad Program (EAP) 
on whether they will be allowed to 
return, some expressed worries 
about the friends and country they 
left behind. 

According to Peter Manley, a 
Revelle College junior majoring in 
Chem/Bio, studenls were requested 
to leave the area in January and 
finals that were supposed 10 take 
place at the end of January were 
rescheduled to the beginning of the 
month. Manley relurned to the 
Uniled States after the exams, as did 
the majority of other UC students. 

Jessica Bahkt, a Muir College 
junior and a Computer Science 
major, also returned 10 the U.S. after 
it was "suggested" thai the students 
leave the country. 

According 10 Bahkt, there were 
feelings among Ihe exchange stu-
dents that their year abroad could 
have been cancelled as early as lasl 
Augusi. 

"Everyday we wondered, ' Will 
we be sent home lomorrow? Should 
we make plans 10 go out at the 
weekend?'" she said. 

Manley and Bahkl expressed 
disappointment thai their lime 
abroad was cut short, and hope that 
Ihe EAP will give them IheoPpol1u-
nity to finish their year in Israel. 

1l1e students will be nolified of 
the EAP's decision by Feb. 15. 

Both student felt strongly about 
the faci that Israel has been brought 
inlo the conflict. Manley said he 
was panicularly offended by Ihi . 

"I am not 81 all pleased with whal 
is going on - they broughl in Israel 
10 try and break up the coalilion and 
il 's very valiant oflsrael not to fight, " 
he said. 

Both tudenls agree that the 
U.S. was right to become invol ved 
in the contl iet. 

According 10 Manley, a war is 
necessary 10 get Saddam Hussein 
out of Kuwait. 

"I don't Ihink the war is jusl 
about oil - we had to move in 

students thai things were not that 
bad. 

"There wasn't the feeling that 
things were looming," he aid. 

According to Bahkl, students 
were not exactly sure what was going 
on in the Middle East and this cre-
ated extra pressure and tension. 

he said. He added thai the directors 
explained exactly what stance the 
university had taken and that the UC 
could take no responsibility forthem 
if they decided to stay. 

"I really wasn't afraid," he said. 
llle students were is ued gas 

masks, and OdinlZ said he prepared 
a room wilh food and water. 

" I hone tly didn'l think Iraq 
would anack [lsraell," Odintz said. 

He also praised lhe experience 
that EAP gave him. 

"You reall y become independent 
and you make friendships with 
people allover the world," he said. 
"You become an adult. 

Middle East has been influenced by 
her time in I rael. 

"I wouldn't have thought our 
involvement was justified for oil or 
the people of Kuwait," he said. 
"But when il came 10 'This man is 
bombing Haifa,' r wondered if my 
friends were alive and how Ihe city 
I was 0 familiar with looked. I 
remembered being in Haifa . .. and I 
became glad [the U.S. wasJthere." 

Although both Manley and Bahkl 
said they hope 10 relum to I rael if 
the go-ahead is given, they feel it 
will not be an easy decision to make. 

and stop Hussein," he said. 
"Otherwise he would not have 
stopped al Kuwail but would 
have moved into other coun-
tries." 

Manley added that he 
does nOI enjoy war, but thai it is 
"necessary in thi case." 

"The streets being bombed 
are streets I've walked on, 
the people who die are people 
I love." 

"I'm glad the cri is happened 
because I can identify wilh 
thing beller .... You leam a lot 
about yourself," Qdintz con-
linued. 

He said that if the war ends 
in time and the studenls are 
allowed 10 finish the year in 
Isrnel, he would definitely go 
back. 

"It will all depend on the situa-
tion over there and how my parents 
feel since they are supporting me," 
Manley said. " If the war is sliII on,l 
really don't know what I'll do. 

''[' d like to go back, but I can' l if 
my life i in danger," he added. 

Bahkl expre sed the hope that 
EAP will not cancel the program. 

" It' very important to go there 
for a one-year program - we were 
cheduled for a year and we pre-

pared fora year," she said. "Coming 
back early i not the same thing." 

Bahlel expressed similar 
sentiments, saying that it i "good 
that we wen I in." 

She said that if the Allied forces 
hadn't attacked, she believes Ihat 
Hussein would have tried to take 
over the entire Middle East. 

"It' s kind of scary," she said. 
"My roommates are out there." 

Bahkt,aftersomedifficulty, was 
able 10 contact her friends in I rael, 
but Manley has been unable 10 get 
Ihrough 10 his friends by telephone. 

According 10 Manley, there was 
a great feeling among the exchange 

- Rebekah Denn, 
Muir College senior 

"It wa not exactly a fear of 'I'm 
going to die,' but more a fear of Ihe 
unexpected," he said. 

Revelle College junior Josh 
Odintz, another EAP student tudy-
ing in Israel. had been planning to 
visit Tu rkey overt he semester break 
before ho tililies broke oul. 

" Everybody 's plans were 
screwed up," he said. 

Od intz praised the way that the 
UC handled the si tuat ion. 

"The UC was very honest. The 
two directors treated us like adult~ ." 

"I hope I am able to relurn," 
he said. 

Rebekah Denn, a Muir College 
enior who pent the 1989-90 aca-

demic year in Israel, expressed 
strong feeling about the situation in 
that cou ntry. 

"Israel' involvement bring the 
war a Ihousand limes closer to 
horne: ' she said. " The streels being 
bombed are streets I' ve walked on, 
the people who die are people I 
love." 

Denn indicated that her feelings

While she realizes it would not 
be wise to relum to Israel immedi-
ately, Bahkt is hopeful that it will be 
afe to do so soon. 

"It' s important not to be afraid of 
lrouble," she said. 

If the students are unable to re-
turn to Ismel , both will resume their 
studies Spring Qual1er at UCSD.

rG BEER BAN 

Poor Ploy on Part of Police 
LaSI week, Ihe Departmenl of Alcoholic Beverage Conlrol 

(ABC) - in re pon e to an inquiry by a UCSD ad-hoc 
committee fonned specifically 10 look inlo the legal ilY ofTGs 
and olher evenlS where alcohol is served - ruled that the 
serving of beer at TG i illegal because it i open to the public 
and therefore requires a liquor license under state law. How-
ever, because TGs are an A.S.-sponsored event, a license 
cannol be obtai ned because the ABC cannot i ue licenses to 
student organizalions. So, until TGs are reslructured and made 
clo ed to Ihe public, Ihe UCSD Police Depanmenl - and 
especially Chief John Anderson -can re t assured that they'll 
have plenty of spare time for donut runs on Friday afternoons. 

There are many problems with this ruling and the mean by 
which it wa obtained. The current TG controversy began last 
October. when the special ad-hoc committee was fonned in 
response to a complaint issued by Chief Anderson, aying that 
the events were a threar to tudent afety and a li ability risk to 
the university. The committee's purpose was to examine 
whether or not Anderson's alleged ri sks were .. ufficiently 
high to recommend discont inuance of the serving of alcohol at 
TG and other related campu event ." 

But the timingof Anderson'scomplaint wa odd. Anderson 
has been chief of police for over eight years. but in that time, 
he's done little more than grumble about the potent ial risks and 
liabilities of TGs. Furthennore, safety and securi ty measures 
have been mod ified each year. decreasing the ri ks. Colored 
wrist bands, increased police and private ecurity officers, a 
decrease in the numberofkegs and the size of cups, and a three-
drink limit have all been effecli ve in discouraging drunk 
driving, extreme intoxication, and minors from dri nking. 

BUl lhose safely improvemenlS, and Ihe fact that Ihere have 
been no alcohol-relaled incidents in the event 's IS-year his-
tory. apparentl y weren' t good enough for Anderson or the 
police depanment. Their new credo seemed to be that Ihe only 
good TG is a dead TG - or alleast a dry TG, which might as 
well be dead. 

The mo t di. turbing problem with the decision is that ifTGs 
are illegal now. Ihen Ihey were illegal at thei r inception 15 
years ago. But despite their inherent illegality, they were 
approved by the admini tration and allowed to flouri sh -
moreorlcss - for 15 years. TGsquickly evolved inlo an event 
that made UCSD especially un ique. A a acial evenl, it was 
largely succe sful in att racting a wide variely of UCSD stu-
dents - younger and older - from all of the colleges. to 
participate in an activity and interact with each other. It just so 
happened that part of the incentive to pan icipate was the 
promise of free beer. 

It is no ecret that free alcohol was the main attraction of the 
TGs. followed closely by the band. It is difficult to believe that 
the police do not realize that Ihe demi e of alcohol at TGs 
effectively mean the demisc of the TGs themselves , unless a 
top-nolch band can be obtained, which is becoming increas-
ingly difficult. Certai nly they real ize that the promi e of 
alcohol wa the mai n draw of the event and by taking that 
element away, the crowds will disappear as well. 

A.S. President John Edson is currently exploring various 
alternatives in hope of saving the TG in its present form. 
There has been much di scussion of relocating the TGs to the 
Price Center. In doing so, they may be able to cordon off the 
Price Center plaza, inc rea e security to prevent non-students 
from entering. and thus close Ihe event to the publ ic. By dOing 
so, they could continue to serve alcohol wilhout a license. A 
les att ractive plan propo ed by Anderson and currently under 
debate is the idea of a "beer garden." Under this plan. students 
who wished to drink would be segregated from non-drinkers 
in a closed-off area. Of course, any plan would require the 
cooperation of Anderson. 

The loss of beer at TGs is unfortunate. It will effectively 
eliminate the only regular, large-scale social event on campus, 
funher separate students, and consequently force more stu-
dents off-campus looking for parties. The TG beer ban solves 
no problems, it just sends them elsewhere, and out of the hands 
of university police.

Edouard Ghorra, told the United Nations 
that the FLO was. "kidnapping Lcbanese-
sometimes forcigners - holding them pris-
oner, questioning them, torturing them, and 
sometimes even killing them." 

For 10 years, the FLO continued to shell 
Israeli civilians in northern Israel. In the 
beginning. the Air Force could retaliate and 
Imock out the weapons locations, but as time 
dJagged on, the terrorists became increas-
ingly more powerful. By 198], the Sunday 
TiIMs of London reponed, .... . rocket-
launchers, guns, tanks and anti-aircraft 
missiles were observed moving southward 
across the Zahrani and Litani rivers ... the 
Israelis were particularly concerned about 
the20and4O-barre1 mobileKatyusharocket 
launchers. which have a range of 18 miles 
and arc the main weapon used by the PLO 
against civilian targets in Galilee. "On top of 
this. the PLO had within its bases T-55, T-
54, and T-34 tanks; 1301mn, l5Omm, and 
S7nun cannons, armored personal caniers; 
SAM-7 and SAM-9 anti-aircraft missiles as 
well as an assortment of heavy mortars. 
There were enough weapons to supply five 
anny bripdcs,aIl courtesy of Libya and the 
Soviet Union. 

tII'IeI could DO longer stand by as its

botderraidsandshelling.Jt wlSjusta matter 
of time before there would be a full scale 
invasion into northero Israel. 

lnapurelydef'ensivemove,lsraeIdeclded 
to wipe out the terrorist bases once and for 
aD. 

Now let's look at Iraq. Saddam Hussein 

COMMENTARY 

invaded Kuwait nor because his citizlens 
were being lcilled by trans-bonJer terror-
ists. but because he wanted the Ramana oil 
fields and a port for his ships. Saddam 
annexed Kuwait and claims it as his 19th 
Province. Israel has never laid claim to 
Lebanon and departed as soon as the PLO 
was forced to withdraw from southern 
Lebanon. How can anyone who bas any 
trace of intelligence claim that a defensive 
in-and-out action is the same as a profit-
driven annexation of one's neighbor? 

Israel acted completely within its legal 
rights under the United Nations and inter-
national law . Article 51, which ensures the 
basic right of self-defense and interna-
tional law, also states, "a country [has] the 
right to enter foreign soil to remove an 
anned threat which the host country cannot 
control." 

TIle last, and probably the most horren-
dous claim I wish to disclaim is, "20,000 
dead, primarily civilians." I have no choice 
but to conclude lhe Alliance has stated 
nothing more than pure fabrication in-
tended to make Israel look bad. The Pal-
estinian Red Crescent, which is run by 
Yasir Arafat 's brother, Fathi Arafat, claims 
lO,OOO deaths. After this statement, the 
Red Cross came out and denounced it as 
false, also making note of the fact that there 
were only 510,000 civilians in southern 
Lebanon. II is a sad day when a student 
organization distorts the facts even more 
than the PLO - the king of distortion. 

I am not going to tell you there were no 
civilian deaths but the Israelis did evel)'-
thing they could to prevent them. What 
made it difficult for the Israelis to keep the 
civilian deaths down was the fact that the 
PLO tL1ed them as "human shields. "Sound 
familiar? They built their bases and set up 
artillery - including SAM batteries -
within the local towns. 

Fortunately,theproficieocyofthelsraeJi 
Air Force kept the civilian casualties t6' a 
bare minimum and this is more than one 
can say for the PLO.

Opposition to a policy of the current ad-
ministration Is not opposition to America. 

In fIct. 10 oppose the war is an essen-
tially "American" thing to do, the very 
deftnidon of the wont. As is to support it. 
To simply express an opinion, tocxercise 
t"nIespeech, is one of the most "Amerk:an" 
things there is. 

But that speech sbould also be intelli-
gent. reasonable, and thoughtful. The 
ceaseless pushing of simple-minded, 
emotional "hot-bUUOOS" allowed us to get 
through the 1988 election without once 
discussing the issues that faced us as a 
nation. issues that are now coming due. To 
go through the entire war without solving, 
or even talking about, the problems that 
are inherent in the fighting would be a 
tremendous mistake.

This put summer I had a r0om-

mate who was visiting the U.S. 
from her home in Panama City, 
Panarna.1O she had some first hand 
experience with • corrupt leader. 
She explained thai while many 
people did not like Manuel Noriega, 
they were recquired to show up at 
his support rallies or rislt losing 
their jobL 

Being there wasn't a matter of 
choice, and it probably isn't a 
matter of choice for many of the 
people in Iraq. Remember that 
people who oppose dictators often 
face direconscquences, if not death. 

So it is a mistake to just assume 
that the Iraqi people on the whole 
support and admire their leader. 
With this in mind, it does strike me 
as ironic that it is against the law 
for us to assassinate Saddam Hus-
sein, but OK to kill everyone around 
him. 

Some of the angry comments 
and sick Iraqi jokes I have been 
hearing frighten me. I say this be-
cause it makes us less sensitive to 
the plight of these people, as if they 
aren't important enough for us to 
think abouL When a missile from 
the Iraqi anny kills a civilian in 
Israel, we all mourn the loss - as 
we should. But the deaths of ci-
vilians in Iraq are no less tragic. 

So before you make a comment 
condoning the total annihilation of 
Iraq, remember that the true en-
emy is Hussein. Funhennore, your 
comments may be heard by Iraqi 
students in your classes, people 
who have loved ones in Iraq today.

overwhelming pain begins. Two 
days? Two months? The intensity 
of my missing him is grossly over-
shadowed by my fear of danger 
being inflicted upoo his life. I wish 
that everyone could have seen the 
faces of those left behind as I 
dropped him off early that Satur-
day morning. Women who were 
obviously in their third ICon of 
pregnancy were faced to deliver 
on their own. Children clutched 
their fathers until the very last 
moment when they were forced to 
leave. They said their good-byes 
as freshly painted tanks stood be-
hind them. Their voices echoed 
off the stacks and stacks of crates 
containing guns and ammunition 
reaching high into the hangar. 

I see the overzealous report-
ers interviewing the families of the 
P.O.W.s. I watch them step on 
these people's lives for a good 
story. My mom tells me to stop 
watching these programs. "Read 
the papers for the facts," she teDs 
me. She is right. I know. But how 
can we not watch. It is true, we 
must go 00 with our lives. But we 
also must keep infonned, we must 
always be aware people are over 
there fighting and we are here.

ATHLETICS: The Future of UCSD's Athletic Program May Lie in Division II 
Continued from p!Ige 1 
situation for UCSD's sports has not 
always been successful, according 
to Gannon. 

"For years and years [other Divi-
sion ill teams] played us and they 
beat us," he said. "Now we're hav-
ing difficulty gening a Division ill 
schedule. We'remol'Cand more not 
welcome in Division ill." 

UCSD is not part of the seven-
school Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, 
which malces it one of only two 
independent schools in Southern 
California. The other, Cal State San 
Bernardino, is moving to Division 
II effective in the fall of 1991 . With 
atotalofll other Division ill teams 
on the West Coast to compete with, 
UCSD has often been compelled to 
seek competition from Division ill 
teams in different regions of the 
country. 

Citing the basketball program as 
an example, Sweet said that UCSD 
has to travel to the Midwest and the 
East Coast to find competition be-
cause the NCAA requires that 50 
percent of Division ill basketball 
games be played within thedivision 
in order for that team to be consid-
ered for poslseason play. 

"II puts a burden on us finan-
cially," Sweet said.

SOME PHILOSOPHIES OF NCAA DIVISION" AND DIVISION III 

Division II Philosophy: Division III Philosophy: 
• believes inofferinga maximum amount of intercollegiate 

athletics participation to as many of its students as 
possible, whelher or not these students are athletically 
recruited or fmancially assisted 

o encourages participation by maximizing the number and 
variety of athletics opportunities in varsity. club, and 
intram urnl spons 

• recognizes the dual objectives in its athletics program of 
serving both the campus (participants, student body, 
faculty-staff) and the general public (community, area, 
state) 

• ensures that participants receive the same treatment as 
other students. They have no unique pri vileges in admis-
sions, academic advising. course selection, grading, 
living accomodations, or fmancial aid. 

o is controlled, financed, and staffed through the same 
general procedures a other college departments • believes in pennittingathleticallyrelated financial aid for 

student-athletes, but on a more modest basis than that 
pennilted in Division I 

o gives equal empha is to men's and women's SPOI1S, and 
desired quality is similar in all sports 

Gannon explained that UCSD 
also has difficulty scheduling oppo-
nents in either Division II or I, be-
cause the opponent gains nothing 
from beating a Division ill team but 
can be severely hun by a 10 . 

Gannon said that the scheduling 
question came up "over and over" 
during Wednesday' meeting, and 
predicted that this will be the major 
issue as the meetings progre . 

Another issue of primary con-
cern to the committee deals with an 
aspect of the Division D philoso-
phy, which, as stated in the 1990-91 
NCAA Manual under the category 
of memben;hip requirements, "be-
lieves in pennitting athletically re-
lated fi nancial aid for its srudent-
athletes, but on a more modest basis 

committee of the UCSDAlliance for 
Peace, wants to be a steady reminder 
of the war and encourages political 
discussion of all types of viewpoints. 

According to Williams, infonna-
tion posted on a kiosk in front of 
Galbraith Hall comes from Peacenel, 
a nationwide computer network that 

than that peonined in Division 1." 
Sweet explained that the recruit-

ing regulations in Division II are 
different, but that UCSD has "no 
intent to compromise our academic 
standards. Student would have to 
meet academic standards, that's a 
given." She added that there is no 
correlation between athletic schol-
arships and academic standards. 

Should UCSD jump in divisional 
status, it would not be required to 
grant scholarships, but Sweet ex-
pressed doubt that UCSD would be 
able to compete successfully with 
Division II schools who do. 

Advancing immediately to Di-
vision 1 is not an option for UCSD at 
this time, becau e the NCAA re-
quires a minimum of four years at 

has up-to-date information about the 
war and peace organization events. 
The group also has a hortWave radio 
that has been picking up broadcasts 
from Twkey and Iran. 

The main coordinators ofthe vigil, 
G.B. Hajim and Andy Howard, were 
not available for comment. They

the Division II level before a pro-
motion can be made. 

A move to Division II would 
al 0 require money. The Athletic 
Department operates on an annual 
budget of $900,000, all of which is 
generated by student registration 
fees. Watson could not specu late on 
the amount of money needed for 
Division II athletics, but sees added 
tudent fees as a near nece sity for 

the maintenance of such a program. 
"] don't think there could be a 

Division II program without added 
[ tudent] fees," Watson aid, add-
ing that thi wa .. peculation" 011

tion." 

According to Gannon, other 
concerns about the move include

othen; who anended a national peace 
rally in San Francisco on Saturday. 
Afterward, they were scheduled to go 
to Berkeley to meet with otherstudent 
protestorsforthe WestemStates' Stu-
dents' Anti-War Meeting. 

Candlelight vigils will be held ev-

entertainment value, school spirit, 
and how such a change would affect 
the coaching staff. 

Men's soccer Head Coach Derek 
Ann trong said that he'd prefer to 
advance to Division I if some move 
was imminent and the NCAA would 
allow it, but he pointed out that he is 
satisfied with the program where it 
i. 

'·1 haven 't got any problems with 
cheduling," he said. "To be honest, 

l'm very happy with Division m." 
Judy Malone, the head coach for 

UCSD's women's basketball team, 
said that she would stand by what-
ever IRAAC recommends but is 
pen;onal!y undecided on the maner. 

"It would be easier [for the ath-
letic program) to schedule in Divi-
sion D," he aid. ··But where 's the 
money going to come from?" 

Women'screwHeadCoachlack 
Vallerga was also tom on the issue, 
but men's basketball Head Coach 
Tom Marshall sees scheduling 
holding the program back. 

"We cannot exist in Division In 
much longer," he said. "When we 
were losing, the phone used to ring 
off the hook. Now we can ·t even get 
a game. 

"Pen;onally, I think [moving to 
Divi ion II] is a good move for the 
student body," he added.

Montagne said that, for him, this IS 
the best part of the continuous vigil. 

"It 's not adebatebut rather an open 
discussion," he said. "People with dif-
ferent views can say what they feel 
and not get cut off."

Regents Approve Ne\vcampus Buildings 
• Warren residence halls to be built on current parking lot 
By Sheryl Wolcon 
StIlHWritw 

The UC Regents gave the g£r 
ahead for the next SIepS in three 
major UCSD construction projects, 
including new Warren College 
residence halls, at their ,January 18 
meeting at UC Riverside. 

The regents approved financing 
$39.7 miUion of the $42 miUion 
total cost of building the new War-
ren College housing complex, which 
will include 400 residence hall and 
200 apartment spaces. 

The 150.577 square-foot com-
plex will a1socontain adining faci Ii ty 
designed to serve Warren and Fifth 
College resident . as well as a 
maintenance facility. two outdoor 
basketball courtS. two and volley-
ball court , and open lawns. 

The new housing will be built 
directly behind Warren College's 
900 existing apartments, which i 
currently the site of a parking lot, 
according to Assistant Director of 
Physical Planning Nada Borsa. 

Although Warren residents will 
lose a large ponion of their nearby 
parking, Borsa said more parking 
will be built, in accordance with the 
Campus Planning Office's policy 
of maintaining a ratio between the

threat to student safety. 

Edson said a Tipsy Taxi ser-
vice is offered to intoxicated 
tudents. The maximum amount 

of alcohol given to each student 
has been reduced to three twelve-
ounce cups. Security measures 
have also been upgraded. 

"I think John Edson did a tre-
mendous amount of worle de-
fending theA.s. sideoftheissue," 
Anderson said, but added that 
"the (ABC] decision again vali-
dates my concern." 

Anderson aid even if a loca-
tion with a secured perimeter is 
found, " 1 till havesomeconcems 
based on the past histol)' and the 
message with regards to the use 
and abuse of alcohol. " 

Anderson also said that the 
TG committee demands a "beer 

number of perking spaces and the 
number of SlUdents, faculty, and 
staff on campus. 

"You never know where [the 
new parlcing) will be," warned 
HowardF'umecy,assisrarumanager 
ofParkingfl'ransportation Services, 
alluding that parldng facilities may 
be pushed toward more inconve-
nient areas of campus. 

Delawie Brenon Wilkes Associ-
ates, the San Diego architectural 
firm which designed the Third Col-
lege Oceanview housing and dining 
complex, has been choosen to de-
sign the Warren complex. Con-
struCtion is slated to begin this year 
and conclude in 1993. 

In addition to approving funding 
for the Warren College housing, the 
regents accepted the design for a 
second Engineering building, and 
appointed architects to design the 
Molecular Biology Research Facil-
ity Unit m at the UCSD Medical 
School. 

The new Engineering Building 
Unit Two will be built at the inter-
section of Old Miramar Road and 
Voigt Drive. The proposed building 
will serve the Electrical and Com-
puter Engineering and AMES De-
partments. 

garden" to separate drinkers from 
underage students. 

Edson, however, said no "beer 
garden" was ever required and sug-
gested that such a statement shows 
Anderson's tenacity in trying to end 
theTGs. 

Edson also questioned the ABC 
ruling on the affair. 

"They can give liberal interpre-
tation to the law," he said 

According to Edson and 
Schnurer, the TO was the only cam-
pus event that brought all ages t£r 
getherand insti lied a sense of school 
pride. 

"[n my opinion, someone isn ' t 
playing fair," Schnurer said "It's 
kind of sad - I've been here for six 
years, and six years ago the attitude 
coming from police officers wasn't 
as oppressive." 

Edson said he expects a "dismal" 
turnout at an alcohol-free TG. 

Nevertheless, TGs will still go 

The Engineering building will 
include offices and laboratories, as 
well as computer and teaching fa-
cilities, according to university rep-
resentatives. 

The recently approved design is 
a diamond-shaped building. looking 
in on an outdoor counyard which 
connects with the Warren Mall. 

The 80,098 square-foot building 
will cause the loss of a parking lot 
and the relocation of a section of 
Voigt Drive to the northeast. 

Projected outlay for the new 
Engineering building is $32 mil-
lion. According to Chancellor Ri-
chard Atkinson, however, the 1991 -
92 proposed capital budget only 
provides for the completion of 
worleing drawings of the project. 

For the third project, the regents 
appointed Lee, Burlchart, and Liu, a 
minority architectural firm experi-
enced in the design of health care 
and research centers. 

The $31.5 million Molecular Bi-
ologyResearchFacilityUnitmwill 
be an addition to the Molecular

search complex, and will provide 
for the expansion of five Medical

By the time the following TG

committee and the UCSD admin-

FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS 
• International 
students share their 
views on America 
By Naveed Merchant 
Guardian Reporter 

What do they think of us? That is one 
question that few Americans. admittedly, are 
wiUing to ask themselves publicly or pri-
valely. Complacent with their image, 
American students rarely think of how their 
culture is perceived by their foreign pt:;ers. It 
is a question that is crucial at this time in our 
lives, and one that yields some startling, if not 
humbling answers. 

One of the first places to get those answers 
is the UCSD Intemational Center. It boasts a 
well-staffed Education and Opportunitie 
Abroad office, the International House at 
Fifth College, and the Oraduate Department 
of International Relations. 

These facilities attract a wide variety of 
international students every year. On Fridays, 
the Intemational Center hosts a luncheon 
where UCSD students meet infonnally and 
casually with foreign exchange students. 

Though exchange student inherently 
express a variety of perspecLiYes. they usually 
agree on their definition of American 
culture. 

One of the opinions most widely and 
consistently held by exchange students is the 
heavy influence of television media on the 
lives and thoughts of Americans. 

"The television is a big part of American 
life," observed Sheny Sami, 20, an exchange 
student from [ran. "([n Iran], we have more 
human contact, we have closer families, we 
visit our neighbors. Americans are very 
prejudiced against Iranians. They think we are 
all terrorists. But I don't blame them. I blarne 
the media." 

In fact, most exchange students blame the 
media for its narrow vision and heavy focus 
on domestic issues. 

"In Japan," said Takako Matsubara, "we 
hear more news about the world. Here, I 
never hear about my country, only domestic 
gossip." 

"More intemational news," agreed 
Ouistine Courtelarre, 22, of France, "is

'The mixture of heavy reliance on televi-

media numbs the skepticism and analytical 
skills of American students. 

"[In Englandl, we are taught to question 
what our professors say, to actually question 
his arguments. Whereas, in classes here

"In U.S. histol)' classes, it's all ideology. 
It's all 'America goes out to free the demo-
cratic people of the world' and stuff. We are 
taught the opposite back home. We know that 
we go out there [to foreign countries] to see 
where the markets are and to exploit the 
people. People know that. I mean we know 
that we're not going to send British troops to 
keep rebels down. In the U.S., none of us ever 
talk about that." 

Thil; cultural censorship may lead to, or be 
the result of, American prejudice against other 
cultures. But whatever the reason, foreign 
students agree that American ignorance of 
their cultures pervades many arenas and may 
even cause a reluctance to learn about other 
cultures. 

"We had 25 Americans studying in our 
school [in France] and they all stuck together. 
They didn't even try to meet people. We tried 
to show them the country, but they didn't 
want that," Courtelarre said. 

Courtelarre also recalled the hypocritcal 
reception she received when she first arrived 

in America 
"Right away in Berkeley, people came to 

you and were vel)' polite, but there's nothing 
after that," she said. 

Matsubara echoed this superficiality in 
American response to other cultures. 

"Sometimes it's hard because people aren't 
interested in someone else's culture. When I 
talk about my culture, they just say, 'Oh, 
yeah, fine.' They don't care about what [ feel 
or what J think," she said. 

According to International Center Resident 
Intem Adrienne Gatanas, an American student 
who has studied in Korea, Gennany, and 
France, this American attitude defeats the 
purpose of the entire Education Abroad 
opportunity, but it is common nonetheless. 

"American students cannot expect it 's all 
going to be like America in another country," 
contends Oatanas. "You've got to be open 
minded about these things." 

Oatanas admits it is difficult, but reward-
ing to overcome American ethnocentricism. 
She remembers her experiences in France. 

"Messing up in another culture is frustrat-
ing, but exciting. I mean, in France, you have 
to weigh your groceries before going to the 
cashier. And I remember thinking how stupid 
the French are. Why don't they do it like 
Americans do it? And then I thought, ' why 
don't Americans do it differently?'''

Ready to 
'Shred' 

• Skateboarding club, after 
struggling to become established, 
enjoys the product of its efforts 
By Sangeeta Mehta 
Associat9 Features Editor 

With helmets on, and knee pads in place, UCSD 
kateboarders have been able to roll down their two on-

campus ramp si nce 1987. Forming their club, however. 
ha been an uphill bailie. 

When student Steve illarreal and Tim Cheng first 
decided to form a skateboarding organization five years 
ago. the skateboarders faced numerous threats, according 
to an August 1989 article in Thrusher magazine about the 
U SD club. 

They "stopped skating for a while until things got 
legal," said Co-president Bruce Barbarasch. 

Then, Canyonview's Recreation Class Director Lau-
rel Dean provided fund for the club and defended its right 
to have recreational facilities u h as ramp. Barbarasch 
also noted the upport of Chuck Gormeley, campu 
recreation director, and that of construction workers who 
helped the club put up a fence around the ramps. Finally, 
the Ready to Shred club (RTS) became an official campus 
organization. 

Now boa ling 30 members, RTS ha "expanded in 
way of members, and we've gotten a lot more campus-

wide upport administrati vely," Villarreal said. Barbara-
ch added that the club consi IS of both males and female 

of various majors, ages. and skating abilities. 
Skateboarders meet regu larly at their two ramps, mea-

suring ix by 28 feet and 12 by 30 feet, which members 
built them elves. Located off of Old Miramar Road, their 
meeting spot is di tant and peaceful, according to 
Villarreal. 

"There are no rules, time limits, parents, teachers, 
cop . You just go out there and skate," said Co-pre ident 
Andrew Schmidt. 

Although members meet as a group, skateboarding is 
an individualized sport, according to Barbarasch. He 
added that while there is no pressure of being on a team, 
the club offers plenty of team support . 

"You're not dependent on anyone." Barbarasch said. 
"We pu h each other on. When omeone learns a new 
trick, you're happy for them even if you already know it." 

"So many teams depend on winning - either you get 
first place or you 10 e . Skateboarding isn' t like that," 
Villarreal added. 

r--------------------------, 

Monday, January 28, 1991 

Compared to orne other team sports, skateboarding 
is not dangerous, according to Villarreal. 

'·It doesn't compare to football; it's not a contact 
sport. As long as you have a technique to fall in, you're 
fine," Villarreal said. 

Barbarasch added that "everyone who skates has to 
wear helmets, knee, and elbow pads. Some skateboard-
ers also use wrist guards and hip protectors." 

Still. skateboarding is a fonn of exercise. "It [ramp 
skating] is almost a fonn of gymnastics because [one] 
needs stamina, coordination, flexibility, and balance," 
Villarreal said. 

According to Schmidt skateboarding "build your 
legs a lot. your lower body. 

"Five years later you notice your legs are stronger 
because you have had some fun ," Schmidt aid. 

"The focal point is to have fun," he added, explaining 
that body-building and competition is not a main concern 
ofRTS.

UCSD History Marked with Several 
War-Inspired Rallies and Confrontations 
Compiled by John Stecket1 
Staff Writer 

Now that the world is facing 
war, we see shades of distant 
memories from the last great em-
Iliet the United States entered into 
- the war in Vietnam. 

As organized marches of pr0-
test are led to bring the troops in 
the Persian Gulf home, the cIern-
onstrationsofthe laIe60s and early 
70s come to mind. 

Evenat UCSD weare reminded 
of shadows of the past - of stu-
dent protests, and of an adminis-
tration trying to maintain a sense 
of control. 'The following is acom-
piled list of events of protest that 
transpired upon the UCSD cam-
pus while the U.S. struggled in 
Vietnam. 

Nov. 10. 1967 - The celebra-
tion commemorating the 50th an-
niversary of the Communist 
Revolution turns into a debate at 
Revelle Plaza between the Stu-
dents of the Independent Left and 
those with opposing viewpoints 
over the issuc of the Vietnam War. 
One student is quoted by the Tri-
ton Times as saying, "Bum draft 
cards not babies." 

Dec. 6, 1967 - Revel1e Plaza 
is again the center of confl ict as a 
group of U.S. Marines, upon re-
ceiving infonnation that a North 
Vietnamese flag is displayed there, 
come with the intention of remov-
ing it. 

Justifying it as their duty to 
prevent the students from partici-
pating in "a treasonous act," the 
Marines, upon finding no flag and 
being asked to leave by the Deans, 
comply peacefully, 

Feb. 21, 1969 - The Marines 
return once again to UCSD, this 
time on a mission to liberate a 
recruiting station. Matthews 
Complex 250 is held by persons 
calling for an end to recruitment 
for a "counter-democratic force 
which is used to support popular 
governments in under developed 
countries," according to the Triton 
Times. As a result, eight students 
are placed on automatic probation

and after a week: it dies down. 

Oct 15, 1969 - The first na-
tional protest against the war oc-
curs as those who have lost their 
lives are remembered on National 
War Moratorium Day. The success 
of this event leads to another a 
month later. 

January 1970 - A General 
Electric recruiter is met by 40 
picketers chanting "War Break-
ers. Strike Breakers. Smash G.E." 
as he tries to enter the Career Ser-
vices Complex. The picketers do 
not force him off of the campus, 
however. After making theirpoint, 
they leave quietly. 

May 5, 1970-Protesting the 
Department of Defense 's funded

dents take over the fifth floor of 
Urey Hall and stage an all day sit-
in. 

May 12, 1970- Twenty-three-
year-old graduate student George 
Winne dies at Scripps Hospital 10 
hours after lighting his gasoline-
soaked clothing on fire in Revelle 
Plaza. As he did so, he held, within 
his hand • a sign with a simple 
message: "In God 's name end this 
war." Winne's memorial service 
draws the largest crowd in the 
Plaza's history. 

Oct, 26, 1970 - A seminar on 
the Marine Corps OfficerTraining 
Program turns into a war of words 
between the U.S. Marine Corps. 
and the Mother Fuckers Murder 
Corporation and Private Marine 
Corps, a group of student protest-

you don't have to be a Marine to be 
a Mother Fucker."

March 12, 1971 - A grove of 
eucal yprus trees at the south end of 
the Central Library is designated 
as a memorial to George Winne. 
Not a political symbol but rather a 
way to "perpetuate an attitude of 
concern for the kinds of feelings 

"April 26, 1972 - Following a speech on 
American aggression against the people of 
Vietnam, 150 protestors march on Chancel-
lor McElroy's house to ask him to issue a

of the war in Vietnam." 
professor, Dr. Arthur Jensen, is 
postponed when student protest-
ors in the audience keep him from 
spealcing with strident, rhythmic 
clapping. While leaving the stage, 
Jensen is quoted by the Triton 
Times as saying, "It is a disgrace." 
The lecture is subsequently given 
the following day to a group of 10 
people, all UCSD faculty or Salk 
Institute members. 

Jan. 19. 1971 - Fourteen 
present and fonner UCSD students 
go to trial to face charges tem-
ming from demonstrations in the 
spring of 1970. Five have been 
charged with offenses ranging from 
trespassing to battery and interfer-
ence with law officials. 

Feb. 16, 1971 - The Student 
Mobilization Committee begins its 
week-Iong" non-violentdisruption 
of the San Diego Draft Board in 
response to the escalation of 
fighting in Laos." Distributing a 
leaflet entitled, "Screw Conscrip-
tion," the protestors plan to have 
20 students per hour flood the 
Board, each asking to see their 
files and carrying some item that is 
pertinent to their case - a dead 
fish, roll of toilet paper, etc. 

Female students are encour-
aged to claim that the army is 
sexist and demand to be registered 
as well. But all of this is to remain 
peaceful. A spokesman said to the 
Triton Times, "This is a non-via-

students have," the memorial is 
intended to be a quiet area for 
contemplation and study. 

April 20, 1972 - Revelle Plaza 
and various Muir buildings are 
decorated with red and blue paint 
and slogans such as "The Indo-
Chine e are not our enemies," in a 
general plea to halt the bombing in 
Vietnam. 

April 26, 1972 - Following a 
speech on American aggression 
against the people of Vietnam by 
the Chicago Seven' 5 Tom Hayden 
in the Revelle Cafeteria. ISO pro-

years and I do not agree with the 
present escalating of it on both 
moral and political ground ." Af-
ter hearing this re-affinnation of 
his stand against the war, the dem-
onstratorsleavepeacefully. Noar-

Nov. 28, 1972 - Clas es are 
suspended for students between 1 
and 2 p.m. and an extended lunch

Barbarasch and Schmidt see skate-
boarding more as an art. 

"As skateboarders, we see 
things differently than others; you 
look at something and see if you 
can skate on it," Barbarasch said. 

"[We] have kind of an infra-red 
vision," Schmidt, who teaches 
skateboarding on the weekend , 
added. 

According to Barbarasch, there 
is a myriad of places where they 
can skate: on the streets, in empty 
swimming pools, in ditches, and in

But it is on the ramp that skate-

boarders practice their moves. 
which require "physical talent that 
goes unrecognized," Villarreal 
said. One such move is a "grind." 
which Barbarasch described. 

"Coping [steel) is put on the 
edge of the ramp; you ride to the 
top. and the truck [which connects 
the board and the wheels] hits with 
the coping; you slide, then roll 
back to the ramp," he explained. 

Barbarasch said that "airs," en-
tail riding to the edge of the ramp, 
g rabbing the sideoftheskateboard 
with a hand. and breaking contact 
with the ramp . 

Other skateboarding stuntS in-
clude "axle talis," "50-50s," and 
"disasters." 

"There are tons of variations of 
movements," Villarreal said. 

Sometimes members use their 
kateboards for other purposes Ihan 

polishing their moves. Schmidt 
pointed out that he has used his 
board a a bottle opener, a seat, a 
dinner plate, and a desk. 

"Once I took a fi'1al on my 
skateboa rd," Barbarasch said. 
"because their were no seats left." 

For the most part, however, the 
skateboarders who attend meet-
ings have one common goal: they 
agree that skateboarding is all about 
having fun , and that's what they 
want to do. 

As Schmidt said. ' 'I'll skateev-

60s Hippies, 70s 
Disco, 80s Greed? 

Robert Walden as Garfinkle and Laura Johnson as Kate Suffivan 
star in the West Coast premiere production at the Old Globe 
Theatre of ·Other People's Money," playing through Feb. 24. 

By Michael SchWllrtz 
Ssnior Staff Writer 

Now that the 80s are comfort-
ably behind us, the time has come 
to begin examining ourselve in 
retro pect and see what our values 
were. Former Wall Street execu-
tive Jerry Sterner ha transferred 
hi career to the tage with his 
comedy "Other People's Money," 
running at the Old Globe's Cassius 
Carter Centre Stage. 

In a time when our heroes were 
Donald Trump and Ivan Boesky, 
corporate America and their law-
yers were the people dealing the 
cards. In Sterner's 1988 play, we 
meet Lawrence Garfinkle (Robert 
Walden), a financial wizard who 
buyout tocks of companie and 
liquidate them for profit. He is a 
glutton of both donuts and money. 
He doesn't need more cash, but 
making money is what he doe 
anyway, In the proce s, no con-
cern is given to the workers or 
communitie that are affected. He 
sets hiseye on New England Cable 
and its gentle leader. Jorgenson 
(Richard Herd). 

Upon meeting Jorgenson, 
Garfinkle exclaims, "With all the 
pricks in the world, I have to do 
busines with a nice guy." Unwill-

Women Are Like What? 
• Mozart's light-hearted opera 'Cosi Fan Tutte' opens 
the San Diego Opera season at the Civic Theatre 
By Caroline Altman 
Staff Writer 

The San Diego Opera pre en ted 
an evening of frolic and delight 
wi th its 1991 season opener, "Cosi 
Fan Tuite." Thi li vely production 
of Mozart's comic portrayal of 
courtly intrigue features six ener-
getic and trong voices, a fine 
chorus. and an imaginative - if 
omewhat inconsistent - set de-

sign. 
The opera, performed in Italian 

with English supertitles, focuse 
on the subject ofinfidelity between 
two sets of lovers in 18th century 
Naple . Don Alfonso ( Peter 
Strummer), an elderly bachelor. 
begins the opera informing his 
younger friends, Ferrando (Keith 
Lewis) and Gugliemo (Hakan 
Hagegard) of the untrustworthy and 
fickle quality of all women (hence 
the title, roughly translated : 
"Women are like that"). 

The two men claim that this is 
not thecase with their fiancees, the 
lovely sisters, Dorabella (J Udith 
Forst) and Fiordiligi (Carol 
Vaness). Don Al fonso bets the men 
that their lovers would indeed 
uccumb to eduction if given the 

chance. 

women to stray from their true 
loves. 

Fiordiligi, the more prudent and 
stead fa t of the two isters. i por-
trayed richly by the full, flowing 
voice of soprano Carol Vaness. A 
the only character with any real 
depth or conscience, s he vows to 
stand by her true love, immovable 
likea rock ("ComeScoglio"). And 
when she does give in to her new 
love, she laments at the inconsis-
tency of her heart ("Per Pieta ... "). 
These two arias present the only 
serious human dilemmas. Vaness 
plays her role fully, inviting sym-
pathy from the audience. 

Likew ise, Ferrando ex presses a 
human response to the infidelity of 
hi lover. The soaring tenor of Keith 
Lewis is sweet. f1awle s, and be-
lievable in his aria, "Tradi to 
Schemito," but this impression is 
undercut by the otherwise melo-
dramatic direction of his charac-
ter. 

The other lovers, although ad-
mirably sung, are much Ie s inter-
esting and real - rather frivolous 
and farcical. It seems as if Director 
John Copley took the "two halves 
make a whole" approach: meaning 
the two women together form one 
complete woman and the two men, 
one man. This would make sense, 
given the title and the apparent 
interchangeability of the lovers. 

cally. 
The only obvious (and essen-

tial) break from this symmetry is 
in the characters of Despina and 
Don Alfonso. Their clothes and 
manneri ms tand out as lively 
caricatures of their social positions. 

Barbara Bonney as Despina is 
quick, energetic, and self-impor-
ta nt , breaking up the often 
homogenic scenes of the foursome. 
Her teasing and didactic arias are 
frothy, coquettiSh, and chirpy in 
her light oprano voice. Baritone/ 

ing to take steps suggested by his 
high-powered lawyer, Jorgenson 
decides to let the stockholders vote 
for themselves whether the com-
pany should be bought out and 
dismantled for profit, or ifit should 
continue 10 run . 

There are plenty of lawyer-
bashing joke in the play. They're 
called "cab drivers. They're tuck 
in traffic not doing anything, and 

"Unlike 'Dr. Fau-
stus,' serious in its re-
proof of wrong actions, 
the play allows the 
viewer to believe 
whatever he or she 
wants to believe is 
moral." 
their meters are tick-tick-tick ." 
And they' re " Iikenuclearmissiles. 
We have ours because they have 
theirs." Sterner is eager in inter-
views and program notes to a-:sert 
that this is a morality play for the 
90s. Garfinkle and his "money first, 
people later" ideas are wrong. 
However, the work should not be 
considered in the same category 
as a piece like " Roger and Me," 

bass Peter Strummer carries the 
cynicism and wit of Don Alfonso 
in his deep, resonant, and com-
manding tones . 

The sets, designed by Peter 
Cooke from the Australian Opera, 
are unintrusive and complimen-
tary to the action. if not a bit stark. 

The only curious drawback is a 
backdrop painting of the Italian 
countryside that descends con-
spicuously and annoyingly in the 
middle of every other scene to alert 
the audience of every scene change. 
This not only makes it unclear 
whether the characters are sup-
posed to be on some sort of journey 
(instantaneously moved from the 
drawing room to the country), but 
it makes the audience anticipate 
what is coming, shifting focus from 

the movie that lambasted General 
Motors and its executives. Sterner 
is exceedingly fair in his present a-
tion; it is up to the audience to 
determine if a free economy al-
lows and promotes actions like 
those of Garfinkle. Unlike "Dr. 
Faustus," serious in its reproof of 
wrong actions, the work is humor-
ous, allow.ing the viewerto believe 
whatever he or she wants to be-
lieve is moral. 

The show is exceptionally acted 
by a strong cast. Roben Walden, a 
veteran of "Lou Grant ," is suitably

available place in the text, he 
makes it difficult not to like Garf-
inkle despite hi s meddling and 
prodding. Laura Johnson is excel-
lent as Kate Sullivan, the high-
powered, high-priced attorney on 
the case. With a self-assurance 
reminiscent of Faith Ford from 
" Murphy Brown ." she s trut s 
around with an attitude that adds 
weight to such lines as, "I'm sorry 
if that's in poor taste, but that 's the 
way I am!" Rounding out the cast 
are Richard Herd as a suitably 
Grandpa-like Jorgenson, Sarah 
Marshall as the corporation 's dotty 
secretary, and Allen Williams as 
Coles, the company manager who 
looks out for his own interests, and 
functions as a modem version of 
the Greek chorus. 

The design of this production 
leaves no doubt as to the dichotomy 

the present scene. It doesn' t help 
that the players have to physically 
step out of the way of the descend-
ing scene while singing. 

The singers play well together 
with an amazing blend and accu-
racy in the frequent duet and group 
sections. The fine choreographed 
blocking is full of movement and 
although the company tends to opt 
for cheap laughs and obvious 
physical comedy, this supports the 
playful and refreshingly vibrant 
spirit of the evening. 

"Cosi Fan Tune" will be broad-
cast on KFSD on Feb. 5 at 8 p.m.

currently popular and lucrative 
trend of being tran ferred to the

production for a summer release, 
with Danny DeVito stretching hi 
acting limits to portray the sleazy 
and obese corporate raider. It 
should be noted that his name has 
been changed to "Garfield" in the 
film, in response to charges of anti-
Semitism by the Jewish label on 
the play's protagonist/antagonist. 

While it is not clear on what is 
right and wrong, the play i funny. 
It is a comedy with a mes age and

By Gregory Huffstutter 
Staff Writer 

On a imple black stage, with 
only a throw-rug, a microphone, an 
acou tic guitar, and a stand-up elec-
tronic ba s, Bob Weir and Rob Was-
serman lit up the near-<;apacity crowd 
with their musical prowess at the 
Spreckle Theater la t Friday 
evening. 

Obviously, most of the audience 
had come to ee Weir, one of the 
founding guitarists of the Grateful 
Dead. On the exterior, all the trap-
pings of a Dead show were present. 
There were the tie-dyes, there was 
the ever-pre ent air of marijuana 
smoke, there was the added secu-
rity, there were the ticket-Ie s fans 
surrounding the theater entrance 
pleading, "I need a miracle" - but 
the one thing that wasn't at the show 
was the Grateful Dead. 

Weir and Wassennan did open 
their two-hour set with " Walkin' 
Blues," an old Grateful Dead tune, 
but it was to be only one of three 
Dead songs they played all evening. 

Weir and Wassennan did, how-
ever, offer the fans a tremendous 
display of their musical talents. And 
that, in itself, was more than worth 

Bistro Needs A New 
Year's Resolution 
By Amy Knoke 
Staff Writer 

All right, so we were a half an hour 
late. We had definitely lost our dinner 
reservations, but it didn' t matter. I 
had already convinced myself that 
this restaurant would be worth the 
wait. Upon entering the uptown dis-
trict, a famili ar feeling of anticipation 
gripped me, I had been awaiting the 
perfect time to visit Canes California 
Bistro, and New 

way to the kitchen , Except for our 
incredibly wobbly table that caused 
waves in the water goblets, I found 
the PDR and the rest of the space to be 
both charming and functional . Our 
secluded area, with its five or six 
tables, would be the perfeet location 
for a graduation dinner or a quiet, 
romantic meal. 

While the decor and architecture 
of Canes were quite tasteful and 

Year's Eve 
seemed to be it. 

The restaurant 
itself was exactly 
as ] had envi-
sioned it. As we 
opened the 
double doors to 
the entry, the in-
tense sounds and 

"While the decor and 
architecture of Canes 
were quite tasteful and 
complementary, the food 
and the service had a bit

complementary , 
the food and the 
service had a bit 
of catching up to 
do. Although the 
menu was lim-
ited , it didn ' t 
bother me a bit 
and in fact, I was 
secretly pleased 

smells of any nighttimeestablishrnent 
came rushing at us like a fan on high 
speed. The loud laughing and chatter 
of people in the bar, and the excited, 
yet slightly frantic expressions of the 
waitstaff, gave the impression that 
this was not going to be a dull evening, 
Squeezing past the festive posse, we 
made our way towards the hostess 
stand where I expected some hairspray 
queen to give me a lecture on punctu-
ality - but instead, the owner ,George 
Piret, immediately found us a table in 
the restaurant's private dining room .. 

The private dining room (or PDR 
as abbreviated by the staff), gives 
flexibility to a restaurant. It provides 
the customers with the option to enjoy 
a peaceful dinner atmosphere away 
from the occasional children, con-
stant noise, and the sometimes annoy-
ing sprinting of waiters making their 

by it. One can 
usually expect a higher product con-
sistency when there are fewer items 
on the burners, but this was not to be 
the case. 

We began our meal with a selec-
tion of grilled chicken breast on let-
tuce with garden vegetables ($6.50). 
Unfortunately, the salad was not wor-
thy of its elegant name, nor its price. 
What actually came to the table was a 
paltry and flavorless sliced chicken 
breast atop two cups of lettuce. The 
garden vegetables amounted to two 
slices of cucumber, two slices of not-
quite-ripe tomato, and a handful of 
sundried tomatoes that I could have 
done without. 

While waiting for our entrees, we 
remained optimistic that the main 
courses would be fantastic. which 
would redeem the meal's meager be-
ginnings. r {y friend ordered achicken 

the steep ticket price and the near 
two-hour delay caused by a shipping 
mix-up involving the duo's instru-
ment. 

Wasserman, who seldom looked 
up from his hunched position over 
his bass, played the sleek instrument 
as if it were a ba ,or even a lead, 
guitar. 

Between hi high-tech bas and 
his advanced picking techniques , 
Was erman showed what to expect 
from ba ist in the next century. At 
times, his instrument sounded a if it 
were a piano, and (with the help of a 
bow) a violin and a Scottish bagpipe 
as well. 

Weir, on the other hand, was the 
man the audience came to ee - as 
evidenced by the thunderous chants 
of " Bob! Bob! Bob! " before the duo 
began their et. Instead of wowing 
the crowd with fancy guitar work, 
Weir showcased his vocals, and even 
left his acou tic guitar off-stage as he 
come on to sing a playful, Sinatra-
esque version of "Misty" as his final 
encore. 

The rest of the how mo tly con-
sisted of Weir and Wasserman tunes, 
including "Festival" and "Fever." It 
also included two Dylan covers,

pizza with sundried tomatoes and 
cheeses ($8.75) that ended up only 
adequately satiating his hunger, while 
maintaining the aura of being a mar-
ginally tnteresting creation. Envision-
ing a healthy, well-blended pasta dish, 
I had chosen the angelhair pasta with 
tomato, basil, garlic and olive oil 
($9.25). I was disappointed and sur-
prised to find out that what I had actu-
ally ordered was a wad of sticky 
noodles with a tomato sauce thattasted 
as if it had been sitting on the stove 
since early evening. It's true that we 
received our entrees around 10: 15 p.m., 
but if a restaurant chooses to offer late 
night dining, it remains theirresponsi-
bility to make sure that the food main-
tains its flavor and freshness. 

At one point during the evening, a 
dessert tray had been carried past our 
table, and believing the old rule that it 
is impossible to ruin dessert , we de-

cided upon the citrus tart ($3.50). Fi-
nally, our tastebuds had reason to re-
joice. But, at the same, time a nasty 
question made its way through my 
mind: ] wondered if Canes had made 
its confections on the premises, or 
whether they had purcha ed them 
elsewhere and sold them as their own. 

Maybe itwasjustan "off' night for 
Canes, although I bad expected New 
Year's Eve to be an active and suc-
cessful time for any restaurant. Not 
helping matters, our service was 
somewhat confusing as far as role 
playing goes. Our waiter was neither 
plea ant nor attentive, pUlling down 
our plates and disappearing without a 
word. The busboy on the other hand, 
was gracious and polite. It's too bad 
that the management cannot switch 
their duties , for the busboy knew how 
to be an unobtrusive presence, while 
our waiter could only give his atten-

tion to his fellow employees. 
Canes has a great location, a 

wonderful view of the side streets, 
and the structure, both inside and 
out, is a delight. But it does not yet 
have the capability to provide a 
completely enticing late-night din-, 
ing experience. Currently, it is per-
fee t for a drink or perhaps dessert 
after a show, but tighter quality con-
trol and better staff training will b'! 
needed to tum Canes into a place 
where the line of waiting people 
goes out beyond their awning. I'd 
say wait until this summer to try out 
Canes - they may have worked out 
their shortcomings by then.

War Kills Our Children 
Editor: 

When it voted to endorse blatant 
brutality, the San DiegoCityCoun-
cil denigrated this fine city to the 
status of a child molester. It's bad 
enough thai we have a federal gov-
ernment with a hidden agenda nick-
named"Descn Storm." Many noted 
psychologists - C.G. Jung and 
Bruno Bene\heim not the least of 
them - have described a direct 
correlation between a nation's pr0-
clivity for waging war and the abuses 
its children suffer. As a grade school 
teachet for seven years I can say 
that. more than any other industrial-
ized nation, America' s chi.ldren arc 
molested to an unparalleled extent. 

I am disgusted with the glee I see 
in my fellow Americans whenever 
they hear of a successful bombing 
raid into Iraq. Do you think this is 
some k.ind of video game? Shame 
on you! 

Reflect, please, before we sadis-
tically take the plunge into this 
planet'S final, self-destructive, 
chapter. Saddam Hussein is likely a 
terrible dictator, but his weapons of 
destruction were bought with 
American oil money and mostly 
built by American or European cor-
porations. And now, in a fit of menta! 
ejaculation, America ' s war-machine 
is thrusting itself into the wombs of 
women and the bellies of children. 
Like Bush' s CIA bedfellow, 
Noriega. Saddam is another Bush! 

Reagan legacy thai has backfired. 
I beg America to stop listening to 

the "Bushit" and instead focus our 
vast resources on our children. This 
generation seems to be messing up 
royally, but let's give our children 
hope. Teach our children, the pearls 
of our future - don't increase col-
lege fees 20 percent. Love our chil-
dren, don't abuse them. Through 
example, show our children how to 
live and be happy. Don't wage war. 
that definitely kills children. 

As for what to do with Saddam. 
Ignore him. Crap usually has a 
tendency of attracting flies ifit's left 
alone, which allows nature to 
transform a disgusting matter into 
something useful. 

Don't be deceived into thinking 
that Saddam is another Hitler. Un-
like the Germany of SO years ago-
the vinual nucleus of that era's sci-
entific genius - Iraq is where it is 
only because several Western gov-
ernments went to bed with a child 
molester.

Us Against Them? 
Editor: 

In response to Mr. Berman's 
commentary, "A Counter-Protester' s 
Guide to UCSD," (Jan. 23, 1991), 
even though I found certain pans of 
the aniele to actually be somewhat 
amusing, 1 was greatly disturbed by 

Does This Man Upset You? 
Chances are, the answer is: yes, he does. The 

Guardian is looking for a regular contributor to 
the Opinion section who can provide an alternative 
veiwpoint to weekly columninst Zachary Ber-
man. Do you have what it takes to kill the giant?

its overall meaning. 
It seems Mr. Berman ios.inuates 

that counter-protest is necessary to 
combat anti-Americanism. He 
states, "We are the ones who arc 
behind America and all it symbol-
izes." This continual reference to 
the counter-protesters as "we" and 
the peace protesters as ''them'' harks 
back to the dark days of the 
McCarthy era Does Mr. Berman 
have a monopoly on determining, 
such as Senator McCarthy did, who 
constitutes a "real" American? 

He also says, "While I hesitate to 
call these people Americans, try to 
appeal to theirsense of nationality." 
Are the Americans the ones who 
exercise theirconstitutionaJ right of 
free speech to protest, or are they 
the counter-protesters who are also 
exercising their constitutional right 
of free speech? Unfortunately for 
Mr. Bennan, we are all Americans, 
not "we" and "them." 

Analyzing and questioning the 
decisions of one's government is 
necessary to maintain a healthy and 
robust democracy. Peace protesters 
are not condemning the actions of 
American soldiers, only the actions 
of our government. According to 
President Bush, one of the goals of 
Operation Desert Storm is to liberate 
Kuwait from the tyranny of op-
pression. 

One can conclude that being 
American is fighting to maintain 
the ideals ofliberty and democracy. 
Yet when these ideals are exercised 
at UCSD, Mr. Berman "hesitates" 
to call the pe'l'Ctrators of these ide-
als "American." Ironically, Mr. 
Berman also emphatically stated, 
"As everybody knows, political free 
speech is the foundation of this 
country." 

I do not fault Mr. Berman for 
exercising his constitutional rights, 
but I do find tremendous fault with 
The UCSD Guardian for printing 
and condoning such a reactionary 
aniele. I expect the newspaper of a 
prestigious institution to publish fair 
and intelligent political views on its 
editorial page, not views that arc 
barely more progressive than Atilla 
the Hun.

face with a 56-38 victory. 

With a possible playoff berth 
on the line. and Saturday'S crucial 
contest versus sce staring them in 
the face, however. the Tritons first 
had 10 spar with The Master's on 
Friday. 

ueso re ponded with a deci-
sive 87-50 win ovcrtheMustangs. 
From tip-off to final buzzer, the 
Tritons were relentless. 

It was clear that the Mustangs 
were simply overmatched by 
UCSO's defense and powerful in-
side game. 

"By no means did we take them 
lightly," UCSD Head Coach Judy 
Malone said. "Our goal in every 
game is to jump out to an early lead 
by eSlablishing our inside ganle 
and playing great defense. This 
allows [us] to give other people 
ome playing time." 

Every aspect of Malone 's goal 
was achieved. as the Tritons ex-
ploded with an early 11 -0 lead and 
never looked back. UeSD out-re-
bounded the Mustangs 60-33 and 
forced 29 Mustang turnovers. 

A major force behind the Tri-
tons' domination Friday night was 
the perfonnance of senior forward 
Bernadene Diepenbrock.ln oneof 
her finest games of the year. 
Diepenbrock grabbed 14 rebounds 
and tallied 13 points. 

The key. though, to the Tritons' 
attack wasthehelp it received from 
the bench. Of the 87 points UCSD 
scored, 44 of them were provided 
by the reserves. led by sophomores 
Erica Scholl and Serena Murillo. 
Scholl, filling in for Beaver. domi-
nated under the basket. collecting 
14 points and grabbing nine re-
bounds. 

Murillo shot five for eight from 
thefieldandfmishedwith II points 
and six rebounds. 

Despite the absence of Cari 
Young. who was sidelined with a 
thumb injury. the Tritons' machine 
operated soundly. 

"Without Carl, we were still 
able to dominate. It's hard to stop 
two six·footers like Lisa [Beaver] 
and Erica [Scholl] when their tallest 
player is 5·9 ..... Malone said. 

Beaver led all scorers Friday 
with 17 points. Her first-half total 
of 13 points equalled Ihe Mustangs' 
entire offensive production in the

While the Tritons executed a 

balanced offensive attack (43 first-
half points. 44 in the second halt). 
their defense continued to excel. 
holding The Master's to four of26 
shooting in the first half. 

"Our defense is the reason for 
our 14-4 record," Malone aid. 

Molly Jonnum. the Tritons' 
defensive standout according to 
Malone. was given the job of 
stopping The Master's leading 
scorer, Susie Sparks. Jonnum held 
Sparks to just even points (three 
for nine from the field). Jonnum 
iUso led both teams in steals with 
six. 

'Tm really happy with the way 
we're playing. We're getting help 
from all over, but defense has been 
the key. We definitely improve 
each game," Malone said. 

The Tritons' improvemenl 
showed in Saturday's key matchup 
with see. 

"It felt like a two-point game 
for the entire game." Malone said. 
"[It] was actually closer then the 
score implied. Our games with SCC 
are always very physical and in-
tense. The referees just let them 

play. and called hardly any foul s." 
With IS minutes remaining in 

the game. the Vanguards got within 
two points of the Tritons, 33-31. 
But UCSO countered with a 9-0 
run that seemingly putlhe game on 
ice. 

Young returned to action and 
led the Tritons with 20 points and 
13 rebounds. 

"She played super," Malone 
said. "[SCC] worked real hard at 
blocking out Li a [Beaver] under-
neath. That opened up some holes 
for Cari ." 

Beaver still managed to sink 12 
points. while pulling down eight 
rebounds. Jonnum followed up her 
Friday night effort with 13 points 
and 12 boards. 

"We need to win the re t of our 
games [eight games left (three 
home. five away)] in order to be 
considered play-off contenders. To 
win the re t of them would mean a 
l6-game winning streak to finish 
off the regular season-tough, but 
not impossible," Malone said. 

"Everyone will be gunning for 
us; our intensity level will increase 
with every game though. I'm very 
confident in them right now."

As it turned out, the offense 
spunered while the defense held 
it own. 

"Our defense played okay to-
day," Coach Bruce Seitz said. "You 
can't expect to hold a team like 
Santa Barbara to three or four 
goal." 

The Gauchos jumped out to a 
quick 2-0 lead, but the teams then 
traded goals toend the fir t quarter 
with VCSB leading 3-2. 

ThetwoTritongoal camefrom 
veteran Juan Millan - who had 
two goals on the day to lead the 
Tritons - and fre hman sensation 
Jake Azevedo. 

Those were the only goals 
UCSD would see until the fourth 
quarter, however. as the Gauchos 
racked up eight unan wered goals 
in the next two periods. 

"UC D '~ team offense seemed 
to fall apart after the first quarter, 
with their anackmen standing still 
again tour aggres ive defen e," 
Gaucho team captain Keith Smith 
. aid. 

"The key to the Gaucho de-
fense was the play of their goalie," 

Seitz said. "He made a lot of saves 
and kept them in the garne. 

"It comes down to the fact that 
they came to play and we didn' t." 

Sunday, however, the Tritons 
came to play, as UCSD stomped 
Occidental 18-6. 

The outcome was obvious from 
the start as UCSD sprinted out to a 
6-0 first-quarter lead. 

The offense, which seemed lost 
on Saturday, came alive against 
Oxy, as the three starting anackmen 
accounted foreleven goals and five 
assists. 

Junior Ed Cheng led the blitz 
with five goals, followed by 
Azevedo with four. 

Senior team capta in Sven 
Haynie had two goals and five 
as ists. 

"We moved the ball today and 
got the whole offense involved," 
Coach Bob McLeod aid. 

TIle strong win against Occi-
dental buoyed the Triton , but, 
according to Mcleod, the team 
still ha a lot of work to do. 

"This squad is probably the best 
UCSD has seen in recent years." 
Mcleod said . 

"We have the talent to win the 
West Coast title, we just need to 
bring it all together."

ranking may suffer due to 
Saturday's 13-4 loss to UC Santa 
Barbara. 

Nonetheless , Head Coach 
Bruce Seitz remains optimistic 
about the Triton • WCLL chances 
in 1991 . 

"We have a strong, balanced 
team this year. We never try to 
concentrate on just being an of-
fensive or defensive team, but try 
to be balanced [between the two] ," 
Seitz said. 

"We're looking forward to a 
good year. One of our goals is to 
[avenge last year's two losses to 
defending WCLL champion 1 Ari-
zona." 

The lacrosse team at UCSD 
consists mostly of players who had 
never played organized lacrosse 
before. However, coaches Seitz 
and Bob McLeod make use of a 
"B" team to develop players via 
scrimmages versus "B" teams from 
other schools. 

Some of the players that Seitz 
and Mcleod have developed to 
give UCSD a strong team this year 
are seniors Sven Haynie, Chris 
Hodge, Juan Millan, and Drew 
Reynolds. 

This season, Seitz wants the 
team to play well enough to ad-
vance to the finals of the WCLL at 
Arizona. A bid for the NCAA 
championship, however, is a much 
more lofty and distant goal. 

InordertoqualifyfortheNCAA 
fmals, a team must play at least 
seven NCAA teams. Teams in 
UCS D's conference which fall into 
this group range from Whittier in 
to Stanford and Santa Clara in . 

Just playing against NCAA 
teams isn't enough, though. In the 
East Coast-dominated NCAA 
playoffs, usually one team from 
the West gets accepted to the 
toumey of twel ve teams at the end 
of the year. 

Beyond that, "west" means 
anything west of West Virginia, 
and results in teams like Michigan 
and Notre Dame-twoperenially 
powerful squads - being paired 
against any team trying to make it 
from the WCLL. 

The WCLL is madeupofUCSD 
and 32 other schools, including 
Whittier-the top-ranked team in 
the West - defending WCLL 
champion University of Arizona, 
and second-ranked UC Santa Bar-
bara. 

For now, the Tritons merely 
want a chance to get back at the 
Wildcats and to get revenge for 
th is weekend 's defeat at the hands 
of the Gauchos. 

Triton lacrosse is an intercol-
legiate club, or extramural, port. 
While the program does get some 
funding support, much of its re-
sources come from team-initiated 
fund-raisers. 

Despite this shortcoming, Seitz 
feels confident thai lacrosse will 
soon become a recognized NCAA 
sport at UCSD, and is CI1COIJl88ed 
by the amount of suppon the 
Athletic Depanment gives to a 
squad !hal srill isn't "official" yet. 

For those unfamiliar with la-
crosse, the game has been around 
in North America longer than any 
other sport. 

h originated with the Native 
Americans around the Great Lakes 
area and wascaUed "Baggataway" 
until it was later renamed "la-
crosse" by the French. 

The span has grown since those 
early days, becoming an Olympic 
as well as an intercollegiate sport.

Rugby Crushed 41'{) 
By , ......... Holtze ... 
Associate Sports Editor 

For the first half of the UCSD-CaJ Poly San Luis Obispo rugby game on 
Saturday, it looked as though the Tritons might be able to harness the 
Mustangs. 

At the end of the first period, the Tritons' trailed 4-0. According to UCSD 
Head Coach Tom Butler, it was "a good team effort in the first half." 

But when the two teams returned to the field after the midway mark, 
everything fell to pieces for UCSD as the Mustangs charged to a 41-0 
victory. 

As Butler said, the Tritons (0-2) "fell apan" in the second half. 
"The team played well for 40 minutes," Butler said. "The second 40 

[minutes] we didn't play well." 
The Mustangs were "a more physical, larger leam," according to Butler, 

who thinks Cal Poly "should be one of the top two contenders for the league 
championship ... and a potential team for the national playoffs." 

Butler said he thought the loss to the Mustangs was a "good learning 
experience. "

me roar" Smith and his linemates were pushed all 
over the field like raw tofu. 

o Leonard Marshall got a little carried away 
with his first half hit on Jim Kelly. Little? He 
plowed through Kelly like a runaway Winnebago. 
If it had been a regular-season game, Marshall 
would probably have been ejected, but referees 
tend to show a little more tolerance when the 
future of the world is at take. Okay. so that's a 
slight exaggeratioll. Speaking of exaggerations . . . 

o Black and Decker time for Dan Dierdorf. 

"As long as we minimize the injuries and continue to leam, this will be 
a successful season," he said. 

Rimes U,glrleiGuardian 
The Mustangs stampeded the Tritons Saturday. 

Dan's new to this Super Bowl thing. but he 
seemed unusually anxious to equal the hype which 
traditionally accompanies the game. Anxious? He 
was spewing superlarives like a bllstedfire 
hydrant. He should take a hint from his partner 
Frank Gifford and pipe down once in a while. Of 
course, the only reason Gifford never talks is that 
he can'l get a word in edgewise. OUfstanding 
circular reasoning. 

Case in point: Dierdorf was heard screaming 
into a commercial that the Giants' drive to open 
the second half was the "Greatest Drive in Super 
Bowl History." M. HOOP 

Continued from page 24 
Forward Gordon McNeill and reserve 

forward Chris Moore led the Triton at-
tack inthefirsthalfwith 10pointsapiece. 
McNeill was particularly effective on the 
fast break, filling the lane for several 
acrobatic layups through the course of 
the contest. 

McNeill shot nine of 12 from the field 
for the game to finish with 18 points 
while Moore came off the bench to con-
tribute 20 points and a team-high II 
rebounds. 

"[Moore] is becoming a fine player 
for us and is a spark off the bench," 
Marshall said. 

The half ended with CSUSB leading 
34-32, despite the fact that the Coyotes 

only managed to connect on 38 percent of 
their shots in the first 20 minutes. 

The Tritons also struggled from the 
field, as was exemplified by senior guard 
Tim Rapp's game-long shooting woes. 
Although he scored a team-high 21 points, 
Rapp struggled much of the game, finish-
ing 10 for 21 from the floor, including an 
ice-cold one for eight from three-point 
range. 

Forward Rick Batt, burdened with foul 
trouble. also had a below-average game, 
making only one of seven from the field. 

Batt had entered the game ranked in 
the top 10 in the nation in field goal 
percentage, converting shots at a torrid 
rate of 71.2 percent. 

Marshall said that even at halftime "we 
were confident we were going to win. It 
was only a maner of time. We were always 

in the game." 
The game was tight throughout most 

ofthesecond half. With 3:21 left, UCSD 
pulled ahead on ajumper by guard Tom 
Shawcroft. Four consecutive points from 
Moore broke the game wide open. 

Marshall praised the Tritons' interior 
defense, crediting McNeiil for stopping 
Coyote star Darrin Queen on the perim-
eter. Queen was only five for 20 from the 
field. 

The win was the Tritons ' eighth in a 
row-a streak that started with UCSD's 
January 2 victory over Nazareth (NY) -
which ties the school record for consecu-
tive victories set in 1972-73. 

According to Marshall, the Tritons 
need to win four of their last six contests 
in order to receive an NCAA Division III 
Tournament invitation. 

Granted, it was an excellent offensive series, 
but a better one that comes immediately to mind 
won Super Bowl xxm. That's 23 for English 
speaking folk . 

o The NFL needs to do something about that 
halftime. Forty minutes? Why didn' t they just 
send the team out for dinner? 

And ir's not like rhe entertainment is any good 
either. The Orange Bowl puts on a for superior 
show. The Bills offense, due to the show and the 
Giants' drive, was off the field for a full hour, 
which is ludicrous. 

Why didn 't the NFLjusl move on to Super 
Bowl XXVI? UI! . 26.

Winnebagos, Dan, 
And ED-209 

J UST A to ·w UPER B OWL note : • The New York Giants 
may not be the 010 t talented 
team in the NFL. And they may 
not be the prellie t. Heck. they're 
dowllriKht IIKly. They don't have 
a' tar Wars ' offense (mil and 
ShOOl, walk alld throw) and they 
don't have a gimmick defen e 
(46, 3, 101. ED-209). 

In fa t. the Giants really don ' t 
have an id ' ntlly. II they do 
week after week I how up and 
play 6 minutes of quality 
C tball. They give you every-
.hlOg they've g t, and leave 
nothing left In the end. 

Whether yo u're a Bilb. 4ger:>. 
or 'agle~ fan. y u can ' \ help but 
admire them. They play hard, 
,lOd rhe play well. 

No other pro football team 
plays with a!> much heart or as 
much pa sion. How els can you 
c plain a team with Jeff 
Ilost tier at quarterback - Did 
\'tllI .w.\' Creg Huffs tlltter? -

orgulllelll ahout II'hich is better: 
lootha/l orill/bol. 

N OONE e er comes out of a game with the New York 
Giants fee ling like they got beat 
by a beller team - Buffalo 
headlille: 'Ciallts ot the Better 
Team' - and yet the Giant just 
keep on winning. I Oavi 
coined the phrase, but the Giants 
perfe ted it: Just win baby. 

• Say this for the Bills: they 
fared better than n;o t AFC 
teams have. In fact, they can take 
pride in the fact that this wa 
probably the be t Super Bore in 
the last 10 year . Of COllrse, 
that's if ),ou wallt to take the 
Deliver/Minnesota approach . 

• Thi Super Bowl summed 
up in a nutshell the difference 
between the NFC and the AFC 
for the pa t decade - the NFC is 
just too physical. 

T HE BILLS were supposed to be the be t and the most 
phy ical team the AFC has ent 
to 'The Show' in the last 10 
years, and the Giants cleaned the 
field with them. 

The Giant ' drive to open the 
econd half wa a cia ic 

example. New York simply 
blasted it way downfield behind 
Otti Ander on and Dave 
Megget. Bruce " I am best. Hear

Somebody pinch the UCSD women's basket-
ball team and wake them up. You should be 
warned that it probably won't work because the 
Tritons are living anything but a dream. 

Instead, UCSD continued its victory rampage 
with a weekend sweep of The Master's and 
Southern California College, bringing its winning 
treak to eight games. 

After clobbering The Master's Friday night 
87-50, the Tritons traveled to Costa Mesa where 
they lapped Southern California College in the

scooped up the 100 e ball and made a bee-
line for the UCSD goal, intent on scoring 
the game's fir t goa\. 

Just as he wa winding up to shoot, three 
UCSD player crushed him in a massive 
body check. As the pile cleared, a lone 
Trit<..' lay on the field with a di located 
houlder. 

That play early in the fir t quarter 
summed up Saturday 'S men 's lacrosse game 
- the Tritons did what they were supposed 
to, and still ended up on the bottom, as 
UCSB came away with a 13-4 win. 

Although UCSD (2- 1) returned Sunday 
to overpower Occidental 18-6, the 10 s to 
UCSB cast a defini te cloud on the weekend. 

The game against the Gaucho was billed

which had scored 28 goal the week before

The waves have been rather large at the 
Canyonview Pool the past few years. 

Although the currents have been kicked 
up by some ofthe top swimmers in South-

UCSD swimming star Catherine Capriles. 

As a senior, Capriles is completing her 
second year on the UCSD swim team. She 
currently holds records in three events: the 
100- and 200- yard backstroke and the 200-
