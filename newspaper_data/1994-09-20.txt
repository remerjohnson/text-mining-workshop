SACRAMENTO - Gov. Pete 
Wilson signed tbe 1994 Budget 
Act lut July, committing $9.3 
million to the establishment of 
a California State ·University 
campus at Monterey Bay. The 
money will be used initially to 
convert the Fort Ord military 
site to a new state university 
campus. Wilson said that by 
providing the resources to 
convert tbe defense facility 
into a university, the state will 
be maintaining its "commit-

years to plan, will enable the 
medical center to produce its

Regents Reduce Proposed Fee 
Hike, Employees Granted COLA 
FINANCE: Reduction is 
contingent on projected 
budget remaining on-line 
By ............. 
Senior Staff Writer 

1994-95 fee increase from $620 to 
a $345, cutting fee hikes down 
from 18 percent to 10 percent. 

Although the projected fee hike 
is not nearly as steep as last year's 
$680 jump, educ:ational costs at the 
UC level have increased steadily, 
culminating into a 307 percent ex-
plosion since tbe 1984-85 aca-
demic year. In only the last five 
years, tuition has skyrocketed 249 
percent, from $1,634 during 1989-
90 to the projected $4,061 of 1994-
95. 

state's revenues and expenditures 
match the projections of the state 
budget. If the state ends up with 
less than anticipated; as has oc-
curred in the past, the UC's state-
supported budget may have to be 
cut. 

situation by Nov. 15. 
Although most students paid 

Fall Quarter registration fees at the 
higher rate, fees for the remainder 
of the year will be reduced, so that 
the overall effect will lower fees 
by eight percent for the entire year. 

In a bittersweet decision this 
summer, tbe UC Regents decided 
to lower the amount of tbis year's 
fee increase and grant faculty and 
staff a cost-of-living adjustment 
(COLA), provided tbe university 
does not suffer a mid-year cut in 
state funding as it has in the past. 

The Board of Regents adopted 
a plan in mid-July to reduce the 

However, this year's proposed 
curbing of the fee increase is con-
tingent upon whether or not the 

"I believe the only prudent 
course for now is to position our-
selves so we are fully prepared to 
reduce fees and then to implement 
those actions just as soon as we 
know there will be no mid-year 
budget cut," said UC President 
Jack Peltason. PeltlSOn added that 
the regents should be able to ac-
curately assess the state budget 

While the general fund b\Jdget 
increase would not affect the 
$2,000 fee imposed upon new pro-
fessional school students instituted 
last year, it would give UC faculty 
and staff their first COLA adjust-
ment in four years. Barring a mid-
year setback, cost-of-living adjust-
ments will be given to employees

Several first-year Warren College stu-
dents had more than their spirits dampened 
Saturday afternoon when a fire sprinkler 
went off during move-in, flooding a suite 
and several rooms in the one-year-old resi-
dence complex. 

No one was injured and the building sus-
tained no serious damage. A fire crew from 
the San Diego Fire Department shut the 
water off approximately 15 minutes after it 
was set off. 

The sprinkler went off shortly before 
noon in the closet of room 322 in Harlan 
Hall, apparently after being accidentally 
struck by a lhldent moving in. The sprin-
kler trigered fire alarms throuJbout the

State Grants 
Financial Aid 
Booster 
MONEY: Gov. Wilson signs in an 
additional $26 million to support 
students with need 
By CMdlce McF.rtend 
Staff Writer 

Despite the rising cost of public higher 
education in California, financial aid awards 
received a boost in July after Gov. Pete Wil-
son commited an additional $26 million into 
the state budget. 

Wilson signed a total of $577 million in 
financial aid to California's colleges and uni-
versities, including over $60 million to UCSD 
in the form of scholarships, grants and loans. 

This year, an estimated 8,500 students will 
receive financial aid, a record for the San Di-
ego campus. 

According to UCSD Financial Aid Direc-
tor Tom Rutter, "Not only do we have more 
students on financial aid [this year], but each 
of them is getting more money." 

The aid figures have risen dramatically 
since last year's totals of $49 million, which 
assisted 7,766 students. In the past eight years, 
student financial aid at California's colleges 
and universities has more than doubled from 
$267 million to $577 million. 

The total number of grants awarded state-
wide has also increased. The majority of these 
grants are dispersed through the California 
Student Aid Commission, which administers 
the Cal Grant program and guarantees loans 
under the California State Loan Program. 

For the 1994-95 academic year, the Stu-
dent Aid Commission anticipates it will grant 
a total of $229 million in Cal Grants, aiding 
more than 76,000 students. 

'"This funding will allow qualified students 
acc:ess to,. top-grade education, prepare them 
to enter a competitive workforce and ensure 
California's economic leadership in the fu-
ture," Wilson said. 

He added, "We bave increased our com-
mitment to provide financial aid to students 
qualified to attend our higher education insti-
tutions."

cial aid distributed to atudents has climbed

Med School Shuttle 
Service Halved 
FUNDING: Budget cutbacks hinder travel for 
commuters to and from the Hillcrest area 
By Tom Barkley 
Guardian Reporter 

The shuttle which runs between 
campus and the Medical Center in 
Hillcrest has halved its schedule 
starti ng Aug. 15, changing from 
every half hour to every hour. 

Budgetary cutbacks sustained 
by the Medical Cen-

cineandOlmpusAI-

While agreeing that the survey 

was flawed because it counted 
round-trip riders only once, 
McGraw said she felf it served its 
purpose. "I believe it's valid. The 
purpose wasn't to exactly count 
the rider profile, we wanted to 

confirm what we 
already knew." 

McGraw ex-
plained that since 
operational costs 
rei y on the state, 
"the cutback has 
had a significant 
impact on the 
dean 's decision-
making."

west entranceon Dickinson Street. 
The night shuttle will continue 

as before, leaving campus at 8:45 
and 9:45 p.m., and from the Medi-
cal Ccnler at 7:00, 9:15 and 10:15 
p.m. 

Previously, the $300,000 cost 
of the shuttle service was shared 
equally by the School of Medi-
cine, Medical Center and Campu/> 
Alternative Transportation Ser-
vices, but according to John Oden, 
Director of Facilities and Support 
Services at the Medical Center, 
shrinking revenue at the Medical 
Center led to a reassessment of the 
shuttle service's value. 

"With revenue down, we had to 
look at every possible cost reduc-
tion," ' Oden said. According to 
Oden, 95 percent of the Medical 
Center's revenue comes from pa-
t.ient fees, which decreased by 15 
percent in two years due to insur-
ancecompany pressure for shorter 
patient lengths of stay. 

During a two-day survey con-
ducted by School of Medicine 
Assistant Dean for Fiscal Affairs 
Debbie McGraw last May, it was 
found that only 13 percent of the 
. huttle riders made up the target 
group of medical students and fac-
ulty forwhom the shuttle wasorigi-
nally designed. 

"The majority of the riders 
weren't connected with the Medi-
cal Center," McGraw said. "From 
[the center's] position, why sup-

years," according 
to Director of Parking and Trans-
portation Greg Snee. 

The three partners convened to 
determine a econimically feasible 
shuttle service, and a more fair 
distribution of the costs. 

With non-medical students tak-
ing up 47 percent of the surveyed 
shuttle users, Campus Alternative 
Transportation Services agreed to 
fund 50 percent of the reduced 
$150,000 cost of the system. The 
Medical Center and School of 
Medicine split the remainder, with 
the School of Medicine continu-
ingto pay for all of the night shuttle 
service. 

Though the changes took ef-
fect mid-June, most students are 
probably unawareofthe change in 
schedule. Riders familiar with the 
shuttle's long morning lines are 
predicting angry reactions once 
the quarter begins. 

"The shuttle is why I moved to 
Hillcrest," said UCSD student Bob 
Bowman, who is now looking into 
carpooling. "I used to take it daily. 
This year I'm going to try not to 
use it." 

11te first week of classes is not 
going to be a happy week," agreed 
Carole Rames, a representative 
from Campus Alternative Trans-
portation Services. "But we will 
do everything we can." She said 
that she and others will be solicit-

AtThurgood Marshall College, 
Professor of Mathematics Daniel 
Wilbert is serving as acting pro-
vost for the 1994-93 academic year 
wbile Provost Cecil W. Lytle ison 
sabbatical. 

The three new provosts are each 
long-time UCSD faculty members. 

Jordan, a founding member of 
the Anthropology department, has 
taugbt at UCSD since 1969 and 
served as chairman of both the 
Taiwanese and Chinese anthro-
pology departments. 

"I'm principally an academic," 
Jordan said, adding that he thought 
that serving as provost would be 
"more interesting" than teaching. 

"It's exciting ... it's something 
new and different. And that's 
nice," said Jordan. 

College provosts, Jordan said, 
can have a substantial "positive 
influence on campus" by address-
ing issues which are important to 
the colleges as well as to the uni-
versity as a whole. 

As the provost of Warren Col-
lege, Jordansaid he will focus less 
on renovation than on simply main-
taining the college. 

"There are two kinds of work in 
the world - building things and 
maintaining tbings," Jordan said. 
"[As provost] there is a tremen-
dous amount of gardening to do, 
and a small amount of building." 

Craig, who specializes in Latin 
American comparative politics and 
served as a faculty member of the 
Department of Politieal Science 
since 1980, said she too is excited 
about the new opportuilities of 
serving as provost. 

"It's a wonderful opportunity 
to work with undergraduates," 
Craig said. "[The colleges] are an 
important part of the uniyersity .... 
They are where the general educa-
tion requirements are set." 

Craig said Roosevelt College 
will work to educate its students 
about the life of Eleanor Roosevelt 
herself. 

Craig explained the college's 
plans for a theatrical production 
about Eleanor Roosevelt's life as 
well as asymposium on the United 
Nation's Declaration of Human 
Rights, which she said "epitomized

[Rosevelt's] life and service." 
"[The life of) Eleanor Roosevelt 

closely reflects the values and phi-
losophyofthecollege," Craigsaid. 

Acting Provost Daniel Wilbert 
has been a faculty member of the 
Department of Mathematics since 
1973, and has remained continu-
ally active in Thurgood Marshall 
College. 

Wilbert explained how his ac-
tivity in Marshall College "was a 
way of being involved in some of 
the social issues without, as I saw 
it, sacrificing my interest in math-
ematics," Wilbert said. 

But when asked by Lytle to 
serve as provost during his one-
year sabbatical, Wilbert said he 
was at first hesitant. 

"I've been doing math for so 
long. academics for so long, that 
it's part of my own definition of 
who I am. Feeling yourself pulled 
away from it, you feel like you're 
not doing what you're supposed to 
be doing .... I suppose its a little bit 
like a baseball player going from 
playing to going to coaching," 
Wilbert said. 

However, Wilbert said he is 
enthusiastic about serving as act-
ing provost, and said tbe 1994-95 
academic year will be one of "re-
grouping" for Thurgood Marshall 
College. 

Wilbert explained the college's 
plan to assess its Dimensions of 
Culture (DOC) curriculum, a 
Marshall College general educa-
tion requirement, to determine

Jordan is a professor and one 
of the founders of the Department 
of Anthropology. He has also 
served as chair of both the 
Chinese and Taiwanese anthropol·

focus will be less on changing the 
college as it will be on maintaining 
it.

Ann Craig has served as a 
professor of political science since 
1980. and specializies in Latin

PINION 

By Dou&I" Alexander 
Senior St8ff Writer 

Most students, when asked what 
they think is most unique about 
UCSD, what makes it stand apart of 
other universities, don't speak about 
its five-college system or its respect-
able academic departments or even 
its multi-million dollar business as a 
research institution. 

They speak about talking trees. 
UCSD has, for better or worse, 

become well-known for its peculiar 
taste in art and strange love for strange 
buildings. 

I remember when I first stepped 
on these sacred grounds, during my 
tour of California public universi-
ties, being excited about the place. 
About its weirdness. About what I 
guessed was its sophistication. 

In retrospect, it may have been the 
talking trees that tipped the scales, 
saving me from Berkel~y's stogie 
old campus. 

While nowadays the trees don't 
inspire much excitment in me and I 
hardly even notice that central li-
brary looks like a mirrored rubie's 
cube standing on end, I have come to 
appreciate other things, unique 
things, at UCSD. One of which is the 
alternative campus media. 

Although I have no deep love for 
the A.S. government, I have to feel 
thankful that it has - at least for now 
- continued to fund so many stu-
dents publications. ('Ibis does not 
include the Guardian, whiCh is sup-
port through advertising). 

Most colleges are lucky .to have 
one campus newspaper. 

Not only does the campus media

provide students with an invaluable 
education in publishing and journal-
ism, but it give people a voice and the 
campus several different formums 
for debate and exchange. 

Unfortunately, many students, 
even after beina-t UCSD for five or 
six yean, remain unwue of most of 

Mike lbey/Gulntlan 

UCSD's indigenous press. 
While everyone gets to know the 

Koala - UCSD's childish, yet 
funny humor rag - as well as the 
Guardian, these are only two out of 
a dozen or so publications which 
will be published throughout the 
course of the year. 

Sure, some are obscure. Some are 
published irregularly. Some only 
have a distribution of one thousand 
- or even less. But they're defi-
nitely worth seeking out. 

Lesser known publications in-
clude the new indicator (or n.i.), a 
politically left-wing 'zine, which, in 
between its rants and rave, packs in 
music reviews, poetry, fiction and 
the like; .

Iitically radical, but focuses on is-
sues surround Chicanos; 

California Review, a journal for 
and by conservatives, which has 
fallen in quality in the past year; 

Eco logic, a nicely done publica-
tion which focuses on environmen-
tal issues; 

Momentum, an Asian American-
Pacific Islander paper, which is mod-
erate to liberal on the political spec-
trum, and big on attitude; 

The People's Voice, an African-
American publication, which has 
been inactive for some time. 

This is far from being a complete 
list. Others include Temper, Wword, 
The Yellow Pages and Alternative 
Visions. Still others are born every 
year.

COMMENTARY: Though our generation is a powerful economic force, furnishing 'boomers with new BMWs and white picket fences, we 
continue to be satirized and marginalized by our elders. As consumers, .we should be more conscious of where we're throwing our money 

DAWN OF A NEW CONSUMER ITCH 
By D ...... J. Hurst 
Steff Writer 

Duringmyfour-year-plusstinthere 
at UCSD, I have heard one adjective 
reiterated tMi inJinilum in reference to 
you felloW student body: apathetic. 
Although personally r believe that 
this was a word picked out of a thesau-
rus by baby-boomer media types to 
"dis" us and our peers, we use it too 
often to describe our own political 
and social habits. 

Apathy a11o~ our peers and the 
campus administration to enact poli-
cies which infringe upon our political 
and social freedoms. Apathy has be-
mme a feedback loop in which our 

acti~ties ue canceled or never gain 
the necasary inertia because of our 
fear that DO one will care anyway. 

Wean changes thisoutJook, how-
ever. The way to start is to focus on 
one single, yet profoundly important 
filterofourday-to-day activities: mn-
sumerism. We must make a stand 
with how we spend. 

Consumerism, no matter how 
much it jibes with mysocio-anarchical 
philosophy, is here to stay. We, as 
students, mnsume a massive amount, 
and we expect to have ~rtain choices 
as consumers. We expect to have dif-
ferent restaurants, different musiCal 
groups, different gas stations, differ-
ent favorite writers - as the 
McReagan 7-11 slogan went, "We're 
your freedom." And "we" means 
choice, not just a slew of junk-food 
stands that does not sell any form of 
pornography. 

As students at a major institution 
of learning, however, we tend to shy 

~way from our usual mnsumer hab-
it!. Although we pnd massive 
annunts of money to be here, we too 
often accept the bland choices prof-
fered by the administration. Fortu-
nately, the choices are there. You just 
need to look a little harder for them. 

Take, for example, this newspa-
per, which stays aDoat solely from 
advertising revenue. Most students 

think it is the only newspaper pro-
duced on campus. Wrong. 

In fact, there are as many as eight 
to 10 other periodicals produced each 
year, funded almost solely by monies 
from the Associated Students. These 
papcn/journals include The KoailJ, 
'1M New Indicator, Voz FronIeriZll, 
People's Voke, Han Min Jok., Mo-
melllllm, The Yellow Pages, Ecologic, 
Temptr and Wword. Every one of 
thescpublications is produa:d by staffs 
of less than to people. 

You will hear students complain 
aboutthe Guardiml-it's boring, it's 
incorrect. its editors hack out the best 
parts before we ever get to read it, who 
the tuck cares?, etc. This attitude keeps 
these students from getting involved 
in CIIl1puS media. And media today, 
my friends, controls almost every av-
enue of "choice" we have. 

If you hale the G/UJrd Dog, why 
not start your own publication? Why 
not mate a biweek.ly paper which 
rivals the Guard Dog? If you don't 
like the GuardDog,join it and change 
it. The GUlUd Dog runs on a skeleton 
crew staff, and it's always looking for 
new people to get involved. 

Anotherconsumerchoi~(onees­
pecially close to my heart) is one 
which you face on a daily basis at 
UCSD. There are three types of busi-
nesses on campus: regental, private 
and student. The UC Regents own the 
Bookstore, the Sunshine Store, the 
Revelle Sundry Store and all of the 
dining services places (Top of the 
Quad, Anchorview, Oceanview, 
Earl's Place). Most of the restaurants 
and services in the Price Center, as 
well as Porter's Pub and the Craft 
Center, are privately owned. . 

The remaining businesses, which 
include the Food Co~, the General 
Store, Groundwork Books, the Cite 
Cafe, the Grove Caffe, Soft Reserves, 
Revelle Bargain Books and Assorted 
Vinyl, are owned and operated by 
students. Choosing from the latter 
group fo r your snack, textbook, cat-

We expect to have 
certain cholcea aa 
consumers. We 
expect to have 
different 
restaurants, 
different musical 
groups, different 
gaa statlona, 
different favorNe 
wrNe,. - aa the 
Me Reagan 7·11 
slogan went, 
"We're your 
freedom." And 
"we" means 
choice, not Just a 
slew of Junk food 
standa that don't 
sell any form of 
pornography. 
feine or lunch needs means that you 
benefit from yourownmnsumerhab-
its. 

The co-ops have a long tradition of 
offering alternative products and low 
prices to the UCSD student body, nvt 
to mention entertainment and job op-
portunities. TheC()-()ps are non-profit 

and student-run. They offer a chance 
to learn business skills and bea part of 
a non.apathetic social scene. Only 
one university in the country besides 
UCSD has student-run co-ops: The 
University of Massachusetts. Only 
with massive student support can we 
continue offering UCSD something 
truly rare at American college cam-
puses. 

The other student businesses fall 
under the aegis of student governance 
boards-namely, the Associated Stu-
dents, the University Center Advi-
sory Board and the College Counci Is. 
While these businesses offer lower 
prices than the regental stores on cam-
pus, they are generally commandeered 
by tomorrow's bureaucrats. Despite 
that drawback, they are a welcome 
alternative to the dog-eat-dog world 
of regent- and private-owned busi-
nesses. 

Now it's time to "dis" the Associ-
ated Students. Each year, about to 
percent of the student body decided to 
cast its vote. With this enormous man-
date, a couple dozen student leaders 
confidently want to spend the $13.50 
each of you gives them every quarter. 
What would you spend that money 
on? 

Well, student organizations that 
jump through the right hoops can beg 
some of this money away from the 
A.S., although most of it gets thrown 
at programming. Usually, the AS. 
plods along doing what Randy 
Woodard (the A.S.'s administrative 
advisor) tells them to, until it decides 
some student organizations are being 
too much of a pain in the ass. Randy 
doesn't have to say a word then - he 
just watches his proteges make quick 
waste ofthe offending student group. 

Listen up: That money is yours. If 
you want a student organization to be 
helped out by the A.S., you'd better 

makeyourvoi~ heard. Too often, our 
elected peer oftkial<i prefer shon cuts 
rather than what is best for the student 
body. This is exactly whatthe admin-

istration wants - it would prefer that 
students waste their time fighting stu-
dents, rather than having to get in-
volved in the dirty work themselves. 

The AS. and other governance 
bodies must be held accountable for 
the choices they make. If these choices 
do not suit you, stand up and chal-
lenge them. Remember, it's your 
money that pays theirstipends. One of 
the more notorious A.S. members 
suggested last year that AS. monies 
not be available to the student body at 
large, and should instead be spent on 
large stipends. 

Finally,l'd like to discuss the edu-
cative element of your stay here. Al-
though there are thousands of rules 
that stipulate which classes are needed 
to graduate from a specific college in 
a specifIC major with a specific minor, 
these rules can be dodged. A perfect 
way to do it is to create your own 
major. I did, and graduated from 
UCSD hardly ever taking a full load. 

Get to know professors - they 
can sign forms to make your aca-
demic life much easier. You will also 
need the professors if you go on to 
grad school. When I started at UCSD 
in the fall of 1990,tuition was around 
$1,800. Now it's two and a halftimes 
as much. What does that mean? You 'd 
bener get $4,500 wort.h out of instruc-
tion. Demand it. 

This new consumer auitudc will 
hope~ully billow outward into theother 
choices you make. Pick up a Disori-
entation Manual to find out about 
alternative businesses, restaurants and 
entertainment you can enjoy during 
your stint in San Diego. Become a 
partofthecity - votehere,careabout 
your local community. And please, 
please, please don't buy into what the 
media ' s we"-polished marketing 
schemes say about us. The media is 
just envious of our youth. 

Hopefully, we won't follow the 
footsteps of our parents' generation 
by making our children into our ver-
bal abuse doll. 

Your parents told Y9U that you shouldn't argue. 
They were wrong.

__ ~ -~ARY: As gloomy as university life in San Diego's 'Golden Triangle' may seem, compared to

THE WEST IS THE BEST 
., Frencleoo Dey ..... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Havingjust returned to San Diego 
after a summer in northem California, 
I find it difficult not to complain. A 
drive down La 10lla Village Drive 
reveals a string of strip malls, inter-
rupled only occasionaUy by anabomi-
nalion of a hotel ortheconcrete build-
ing of a secretive bio-tech company. 

It 's like some sort of futuristic, 
pristine nightmare - we sold our 
souls for uniform streets, plenty of 
parking and Subway sandwiches. 

But as soulless and dismal as La 
Jolla seems, and as annoying as living 
here wilhout a car can be, I am some-
times reminded of just how much 
worse it might be elsewhere. 

Summers in Minnesota, for ex-
ample, are brutal. It hu rts just to be 

alive. Somehow nature has combined 
the sweltering agony of being burned 
alive with the distinctly unpleasurable 
feeling of drowning to death. Tem-
peratures and humidity both get stuck 
at 100 for weeks on end. 

I am a nalive Californian. I know 
earthquakes. I know fires. I know 
traffic jams on freeways at midnight. 
I can deal with these things. 

I cannot handle Minnesota sum-
mers. 

But the heat was hardly a concem 
when compared to the bugs. The mos-
quitoes were of biblical proportions: 
they blocked oullhe sun as they moved 
- thousands of huge, vicious, man-
eaters that hovered in swanns. I some-
times cry when I think about them.

, ,sola every summer to visit my rela-
tives. And every summer I would start 
complaining even before we got to the 
car. 

My Dad would invariably look 
down at my sweat-stained face and 
say, "This, Cisco, is why we live in 
California. .. Then he would chuckle a 
bit and add, "And you haven't even 
been here in the winter." 

I haven't been back in years, but 
the other day in the newspaper, I came 
across something that reminded me of 
what my father had saved me from-
and how great it really is living in San 
Diego. 

Northwest Airlines thought it 
would bea cute little publicity stunt to 
offer some "Mystery Fares." They 
announced with great fanfare that the 
first 300 people to drop by the India-

napoIis, Indiana airport after 11 Lm. 
on a Wednesday a few weeks back 
oould buy vouchers for a flight to 
"somewhere" that weekend. 

The tickets went for $59 a roundtrip 
per person, or $99 per couple. Sounds 
great, but here's the caleh. The ticket 
buyers would not know where, out of 
about 15 possible cities, they would 
be sent for the day. AIl of the tickets 
required leaving in the morning and 
retumingthe same night. 

The list of possible destinations 
didn't inspire much, either. Sure, some

There'd Be 

Like This 
F!ha,tos by Chuck Nguyen 

The look on the face of Joel Starr as he tries to get his 
phone hooked up pretty well sums up most student's first 
day at UCSD. Despite the best efforts of college staff, if 
you didn't spend half of your day in line for something, 
you've probably done something wrong. 

By 10 in the morning, students at Muir were stuck in 
lines for the Tenaya and Tioga residence hall elevators. Joel 
(right) walked right up to a phone, only to fi nd himself in 
an electronic line as he competed with thousands of other 
students with the same idea. 

-

But when all the beds are made, the phones installed and 
the parents bid farewell, you'd think the lines would get 
better, but they don't. Instead the rest of the 14,000 stu-
dents arrive and make everything that much worse. 

Welcome to UCSD.

16 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Tueeday. September 20, 1994 

COMMENTARY: Many myths are perpetuated about UCSD, its academics and its social life, despite the 
school's numerous social and educational opportunities 

UNDOING THE 'NAY' OF THE NAYSAYERS 
., ........ ec 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Welcome to the 1994-95 school 
year at UCSD.I would like to take this 
time to expose some of the myths 
about ths campus for the sake of in-
coming freshmen, transfer students 
and even some of you returning veter-
ans. 

In particular, two myths really 
bother me. The first is that UCSD is 
not really that good of a school, that it 
is overrated, etc. The other is that 
UCSD lacks activities and social life 
for its students. If anyone tells you 
either of these things - or if you 
overhear them - don't believe the 
hype. 

From time to time, I've heard stu-
dents, mainly undergraduates, ques-
tion UCSD's academic reputation. 
"It's an impractical education - too 
much theory," many of them com-
plain. 

While it's true that the UCsystem 
is geared more toward theory than 
other colleges, it's untrue that it offers 
an impractical education. What con-

stitutesa practical education, anyway? 
Do I have to stick my head in an 
accounting book and crunch numbelS 
or do technical drafting all day to 
receive a practical education? 

The reality is that the starting me-
dian salaries of UCSD.graduates are 
still considerably higber than those of 
graduates of CSU and regional pri-
vate schools. That includes business 
majors - and UCSD doesn't even 
have a business school. In addition, a 
higher percentage of UC students are 
admitted to the best graduate and pro-
fessional schools each year than any 
Olherpubl ic school system in the coun-
try. But I suppose naysayers will 
contuinue to think a UC education is 
impractical. They will just have to 
wait and see for themselves. 

People complain about all sorts of 
thingson campus. I've heard them all. 
Perhaps the funniest is the claim that 
UCSD, and for that maner San Diego, 
has no heart - that UCSD is a micro-
cosm of a city in which citizens have 
no sense of community andwho,quite 
frankly, don't care about the place.

nIty and who, quite 
fIaddy, don't care

"There's no 'there' there," I heard a 
professor, originally from the Bay 
Area, disinforrn her class. 

While there's some legitimacy to 

this view- UCSD'sfive-sc:hool sys-
tem tries 10 maintain a small-school 
feeling amid a huge campus, effec-
tively decentralizing campus life -
UCSD undeniably still has a focal 
point: the Price Center. 

I've also heard ridiculous com-
plaints about an alleged impersonal 
campus feeling, somehow related to 
the imposing concrete buildings. 
UCSD is no less personal of a campus 
than any other huge, research-oriented 
institution, and its staff is no less car-
ing. As for the architecture, its futur-
istic theme is not only distinct -
people always remember the Central 
Library after they see it T""" but it is 
timeless as well. Besides, a campus' 
architecture cannot dictate the tone of 
an entire school. What really distin-
guishes a school are the people: the 
students, staff and faculty. 

Nowhere will you find brighter 
students: incoming freshmen are se-
lected from the top 10 percent of their 
highschool classes. Nowhere will you 
find a more eftkient and dedicated 
staff; just head north 10 UCLA or 

ll\ore SchOols 

It'S 
. )OU. "W8.l't to be: 

o VIM U.8"'" 1ftG. 199 .. 

Berlteleyand you will stand in a three-
·hour line for just about everything. 
And nowbere will you find a more 
prestigious and creative faculty: In its 
short existence, UCSD has gained 
nationaJ recognition in the sciences, 
as well as the social sciences and 
humanities. In fact, six of the UC's 11 
Nobel prize winners are at UCSD. 

Many still oomplain. At worst, it 
amounts to whining, and at best, the 
logic of the naysayers' aiticismgoes 
IS follows: The hard curricula and the 
lack of community set against the 
bacJcdrop of a large, impersonal cam-
pus creates a poor social life. That 
simply isn't true. One's social life is 
what one makes of it 

I've learned that those who com-
plain are the same unimaginative 
peopIewhowandCrtheaislesofBIock-
buster Videoon weekend nights. They 
are the same people who never anend 
any athletic events, and who com-
mute to campus and never talk to 
anyone. 

But perhaps the lack of communi-
cation between students is a campus-
wide problem. One of the rust things 
that students could do to rid UCSD of 
its "boring". reputation is to open up 
and begin talking with one another. 

If you have problems talking to 
other students, you should take ad-
vantage of the numerous students or-
ganizations at UCSD. There are doz-
ens of fraternities and sororities to 
join, and over 100 diverse, college 
organizations, rangingfrom academic 
10 recreational. And ifby some chance 
you aren't interested in any of theae 
established poups, you could get a 
few friends together and, provided 
you meet the requirements, be eli-
gible for A.S. funding. 

Besides student organizations, 
there are many thinis 10 do around La 
Jolla and San Diego. There is always 
the beach or Torrey Pines Reserve. 
For those of you looking for nightlife, 
the Pacific Beach bar scene, the Gas 
Lamp district and Tijuanaoffer plenty 
of excitement. In addition, there's 
alway a party raging somewbere on 
campus, University City, Del Mar or 
La JoIIL You just need to find out 
about them ahead of time. The point is 
that tbcreisso much to do at UCSD-
if you take the initiative. 

So if you hear someone question 
UCSD'saademicreputationoraiti-
cize it as dull and asocial, set them 
straight It's only as good as we make 
it. There are some naysayers out there 
and always wiD be. But of course, if 
attending one of the finest public 
schools and living in the best weather 
in the nation isn't appealing to them, 
then maybe UCSD isn't for them after 
all.

HELL: The urge 
to flee is not as . 
strong in San Diego 
ContInued rr- ..... 
member, these people live in india-
napolis. . 

People bcpn Iiaina up at 3 Lm. 
By the time thovouc:hers wentonsa!e, 
1,soo people were clamoring for~ 
ticket out of town. 

The line wound from the ticket 
counter through the airport, down 
an escaIator- that would be a sight 
to see - and through the baggage 
area. 

'Ibis would not happen in San Di-
ego. The urge to flee is oot nearly IS 
strong here. 

Late arrivals, desperate for 
vouchers, lurked near tbe front of 
the line, begging for people to strike 
a deal and give up their seats for a 
protit. 

One guy, Jason Wright, eventu-
ally bought four vouchers, for a total 
of 5290, from a couple who had been 
in line for hours. 

"I just have to get out of India-
napolis for one day," he said. 

University life can be tough. La 
Jolla can make it seem deplorable. 
Just remember it could always be 
worse - you could live in Indiana, 
dCsperate for a chance to spend even 
dew quality hours shopping in Fargo, 
North Dakota. 

CDwering from massive insects is 
not a way of life in San Diego. In 
February, we get 10 say things like, 
"Pass the sunblock. " When I found 
out that the central heat in my house 
didn't work, I didn't panic. Nor was I 
going 10 get it fixed. 

Life here is pretty good, and just 
knowing that Fargo is an improve-
ment for some people makes me feel 
better. I'm ready for another year, 
thank you.

PROVOST: 
Administrators discuss 
system-wide problems 
~from,...5 

whether aspects of the course could 
benefit from minor changes. 

"DOC has been in three years, 
it's now running and its running 
quite well. I think its time to go 
back to it ... and start picking at the 
bits and pieces to see if it's what 
we want," Wilbert said, noting the 
possibility of easing the reading 
list standardization and giving 
DOC professors more autonomy. 

Beyond administration of their 
respective colleges, each of the 
new provosts voiced concerns 
about larger issues facing students 
and the university, such as the 
UC's budget crisis, educational 
access and underrepresentation . 

According to Jordan, the most 
critical issue facing the university 
today is "surviving the extremely 
lowperiodofsupport [for the UC) 
from the state." 

Craig also cited the UC's fi· 
nancill woes as a important issue, 
explaining that "for students, this 
means working more hours, which 
detracts from school work." 

Jordan also criticized cost-cut· 
ting early retirement programs, 
such as VERIP, as damaging to 
tbe university. The UC is not only 
loosing prominent faculty, said 
Jordan, but also "institutional 
memory," noting that both War-
ren Provost Dlvid Wong and 
Roosevelt Provost James K. Lyon 
have left UCSD through VERIP. 

"We have these dislocations 
because of the budget," Jordan 
added. 

Jordan said he is optimistic 
though, that the UC budget crisis 
is only temporary and thlt as the 
California economy picks up, 10 
will funding for higher education. 

"Over the whole, the university 
bas faired well when the state has 
faired weJl, and not so well, when 
the state has faired not so well .... 
I'm reasonably optimistic that we 
will pUJl through it," Jordan said.

.Juggle Locations 

James Keunzi, Pulse was asked to 
bid for the space by the university 
because the copy center was clos-
ing and the campus lacked a full-
service Kinko's-type copy and 
computer center. 

Several businesses were moved and added to 
the Price Center this past summer. The 3rd level 
is unchanged and omitted from this map.

By FrMCleco DeVries 
Senior Staff Writer 
. Price Center vendors played a 
game of musical stores over the 
summer in an effort to improve 
student services. The Price Center 
increased the size of Council 
Travel and added Pulse, a full-
service copy, desktop publishing 
and graphics center to replace both 
Mac's Place and the Price Copy 
Center. 

Pulse, a new company special-
izing in providing copy, data and 
graphics service~ to college cam-
puses, moved into the space previ-
ously held by Mac's Place and the 
Post Office. . 

According to General Manager 

Mac's Place permanently 
closed, but portions of the former 
computer training and services 
center have been incorporated into 
Pulse. The Post Office moved into 
the old Council Travel location 
and Council Travel moved into 
the old copy center location on the 
ground Hoor of the Price Center. 

The copy center will include 
the copy and fax services that were 
offered by the old center, as well 
as photo processing, four com-
puter workstations, color copying 
and full binding and thesis pro-
duction services. The eight self-
serve copiers will also be wired to 
accept the unIversity's Plus Card.

Bursar Extends HourS 
For Welcome Week 
.,CMIoe ........ 
sc.tr Writer 

The UCSD Bursar's office 
will extend office hours &om 
DOW until Sept. 30 in order to 
meet the growing number of stu-
dena. picking up financial aid 
checks this year. 

'"This is for the students. This 
is to improve customer service, to 
explained Bursar Howard Fisher. 

The office will be open Mon-
day through Friday, from 7 a.m.-
5 p.m. for the next two weeks 
and will resume regular hours 
(Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.-
4 p.m.) on Oct. 3. 

Students must also pick up 
time cards for appointments later 
that day, which virtually elimi-
nate.d lines at the bursar's office: 

"{Last MODCIay) about 700 
studcnCs went through the of-
fice and there were no linea," 
Fisher said. "This is the most 
studenCs we've ever seen in one 
day." 

Extended hours and increased 
efficiency have been due in part 
to a change in employee hours. 

"Rather than have employ-
ees work overtime as in previ-
ous years, we've split up the 
shifts to extend the hours," said 
Fisher. 

Fisher also said that there will 
be other changes in the future, 
including the creation a system 
that directly deposits financial 
aid checks into students' bank 
accounts.

UCSD students will DOW be 
able to enjoy more capitalist con-
venience with the La Jolla Village 
Sbopping Center at the comer of 
Villa La lolla Drive and Nobel 
Drive. 

The Good Guys, Ross Dress 
for Less, Marshall's, Trader Joe's, 
Islands Restaurant and California 
Pizza Kitchen already opened this 
summer, and when completed the 
complex will hold over 26 tenants. 

Slated to open in the next few

Records, America 's Original 
Sports Cafe and various food and 
clothing stores. 

The 15-y_ear-old mall was

closed in 1992 after tbe La Jolla 
Square Venture Partners purchsed 
the complex to create a "state-of 
tbe-art community shopping cen-
ter" with a S60 million facelift on 
the 77 acre site. 

According to Jerry Yahr, se-
nior vice president of the Koll Real 
&tate Group which is handling 
the development and construction 
management of the project, "the 
revitalized center will provide hun-
dreds of much-needed jobs for the 
community and substantially in-
.creased tax revenues to the city, 
making the situation quite posi-
tive for everybody." 

One of the main features of the 
center is a Smith's Food and Drug 
that measures over 80,000 square 
feet and contains dry c1eanin~ ser-

vices and sushi bar. 
The ncw design of the mall 

includes "de-mailing" the center-
filling stores and turning the store-
fronts toward the parking lot-as 
well as a350carsubterranian park-
ing garage and extensive re-land-
scaping. 

Mall organizers hope to attnct 
the UCSD community with ten-
ants such as Tower Records, The 
Good Guys and the 1 o screen AMC 
Theatres. 

The center will hold its official 
Grand ' Opening ceremonies 
throughout October, as the remain-
der of tenants are slated to open 
during the month. The movie the-
atre and sports cafe are scheduled 
to open early December.

In addilion, Pulse is "going to 
get heavy into the graphics area," 
Keunzi said. 

According to Keunzi, Pulse will 
focus entirely on servicing the 
campus and will nol solicit oul-
side business. " We are here for the 
campus," he a~ded. 

In an effort to bring in people 
that " know the campus," Keunzi 
reports that at least five students 
will be among his firsllO employ-
ees. Siudeni employee wages wiU 
slart al $5.90 an hour. 

UCSD is the first location in 
which Pulse will own and operate 
its own center. "If it is going to he 
a chain, then this is the start of it," 
said Keunzi. 

Pulse currently manages a copy 
center for USC, and will shortly 
open ils own cenlers across IQwn 
al San Diego Slate University and 
al UC Sanla Barbara. 

Council Travel also relocaled 
because the old location was 100 
small for Ihe amount of business it 
was doing, according to Manager 
Mark Criswell. During the peak 
months from April to June, the 
agency handles up to 250 students 
a day. 

The new office space holds 200 
square feet more space, which al-

The UCSD Guardi_ 

lows for an additional staff penon . 
up front and a new person to handle 
phoQe orders. 

The travel agency currently 
employs two part-lime students in 
addition to its five full-lime em-
ployees, butt hat will increase later 
in Ihe year. 

In other changes, Zip's 
Tummybuster in the food court 
reduced prices and revamped its 
menu and the UCSD Alumni of-
fice moved down to Gilman street 
freeing up space for another con-
ference room. According to Uni-
versity Centers Director Jim 
Carruthers, UCSD handled almost 
12,000 reservations last year and a 
new conference room was essen-
tial.

WATER: 
Three rooms and suite 
flooded by squall 
contInuecI from .... 1 

but "water was gushing around 
. the edges," Mann said. 

The smell, originally identified 
as gas, turned out to be the odor of 
the stagnant water, according to 
housing maintenance crews on the 
scene. 
. Mann, who stayed in the suite 
until UCSD police arrived, stuffed 
towels under her door to keep tbe 
water out. 

According to Warren Assistant 
Residence Dean Eric Rollerson, 
once the sprinklers have been trig-
gered students cannot tum them 
off. 

"It does scare you, but there's 
nothing you can do at that point," 
Rollerson said. 

Warren first-year student Lara 
Shumer, who was also in the suite 
when {he sprinkler went off, 
seemed to' agree. "We will never 
forget our first day, ~ver," Shu mer 
said. . 

Building maintenance and 
Floodbusters had pumped most of 
the water from the rooms by 3 p.m. 
and the residents were allowed to 
complete their move-in Saturday 
afternoon. The floor was not ex-
pected to be completely dry until 
early this week.

AID: 
Percentage of loans 
also increasing 
continued from ..... 1 
tributed to students has climbed 
steadily, the percentage of loan 
aid has also increased. In 1989,31 
percent (S6.9 million) of the S22.5 
million total financial aid was dis-
tributed as loans. Since then, the 
figure has increased to 37 percent 
($24 million) of the estimated $65 
million. 

Marshall senior Jay Chevalier, 
a member of Concerned Students 
an organization dedicated 10 the re~ 
ductionoftuition,explained what he 
sees as additional problems with 
the state's financial aid system. 

"I think financial aid should re-
evaluate how they determine 
who'seligible. For instance, you're 
not considered an independent 

unlil you're 24. 
te 
se 

"One of the first things . Pc 
Wilson did in office was to rai 
the GPA from 3.0 to 3.5. Ther 
fore, aftcrworking 10 get the 3.0 
couldn't get a Cal Grant," Chev 

e-
, I 
a· 

Iier added. 
e However, Ruller said that h 

believes financial aid will con 
tinue to increase as it has for man 
years. "As fees and other costs g 
up, families are not in a position t 
give more. [Financial aid] has I 
keep increasing," said Ruiter.

The increased aid will also bol 
ster traffic in the Bursar's Offic 
due to more students picking u 
financial aid checks. "The numbe 
of financial aid recipients this year 
increased significantly from $25 
million in 1990 to $65 million in 
1994, which meansthereare more 
people picking up checks," Bursar 
Howard Fisher said. 

FINANCIAL AID INCREASES 
Over the past few years, the total amount of 
money spent on financial aid has increased 
steadily, but so has the number of students 
receiving aid.

Although Samiam comes out of the 
same Bay Area punk scene that has

confuse the two groups. While Green 
Day's immature antics have gained it a 
loyal teen (ollowing, Samiam's songs are

Cool cafes in an urban setting 
• • • • • 

Hillcrest never runs out of variety or 
culture. Everything is in walking distance, 
especially along the main drag of University 
Ave. This central street offers an array of 
places to go, ranging from casual cafes to 
diverse restaurants to unique clubs. Also 
well-known as a gay community, Hillcrest is 
a city where people are relaxed and accept-
ing. It's a great place to hang out. 
DIreGtIoM 

Take the 5 south to Washington St., make 
a left at the light and go up the hill. Once at 
the topofthe hill, veer to the right to get onto 
University Ave. There's also a free shuttle 
bus which goes from the UCSD biomedical 
library to Hillcrest. 

.... --Right next to the San Diego Zoo is Balboa 
Park, a beautiful and spacious park which 
also offers 10 different museums, and laser 
shows at the space theater. During the week-
end, diverse live entertainment can be 
watched outside along the main promenade, 
which divides the two long rows of muse-
ums. There is much to do here, but the area 
is also perfect for a relaxing stroll, picnic or 
nap, especially when taking a break from 
school. 
. ...,.... 

Chilangos (142 University Ave.) serves 
delicious, authentic food from Mexico City. 
The food is reasonably priced and different 
than all of the other Mexican food around 
town. Torero's (3926 30th St.) is another 
excellent mexican restaurant. There are also 
many Thai food restaurants in Hillcrest, in-
cluding two located right across the street 
from each other, Thai Foon (540 University 
Ave.) and Taste of Thai (527 University 
Ave.), which offers patio seating and fresh 
air. 

Two newly-opened restaurants situated 
right next door to each other are Schlotsky'. 

• • • • • 
Throughout the month, the Galeria offers 
diverse cultural and musical shows. Other 
coffeehouses incluse &presso Roma (406 
University Ave.), The Study (401 Univer-
sity Ave.), Quel Fromage (523 University 
Ave.) aDd Sol y Luna(1419 University Ave). 
IIINten 

One of Hillcrest's major assets is its many 
theatres which show alternative and foreign 
films. These movie houses include Hillcrest 
Cinemas (3965 5th Ave.), the Park Theatre 
(3812 Park Blvd.) and the Guild (3827 5th 
Ave.). Nearby in Kensington is the Ken 
Cinema (4061 Adams Ave.), which shows 
revival films, documentaries and rarely-re-
leased new films. 
I.U .. P'" 

Used bookstores line popular 5th Ave., 
such as the Blue Door Bookstore (3823 5th 
Ave.), which offers a more contemporary 
selection. Also on 5th Ave. is Off The Record 
(3856 5th Ave.), where you can choose from 
a good selection of both new and used CDs. 
This popular avenue has other various cloth-
ing and gift stores whieh add to Hillcrest'S 
charm. 
CIu_ 

The Alibi (1403 University Ave.) is a bar 
which attracts people ranging in age from 
early-mid 20's to those old enough to remain 
faithful visitors throughout the entire week. 
Pool tables are available but often occupied. 
The Lamplighter (817 West Washington St.) 
is a quaint bar for locals as well as visitors. 
There are pool tables and nightly Karaoke 
singing Tuesday through Sunday. The Brass 
Rail (3796 Sth Ave.), The Flame (3780 Park 
Boulevard) and Rich's (1051 University 
Ave.) are three well-known gay and lesbian 
bars. 

-c..eu .... 

deli food (350 Univer-
sity Ave.), which serves 
tasty sandwiches and 
pizza on homemade 
bread, and Chefs Wok 
(350 University Ave.), 
a casual, Chinese fast-
food joint. Caf6 Eleven 
(1440 University) has 
great mid-week specials 
and Hamburger Mary's 
(308 University) is 
known for its fantastic 
burgers. For atmo-
sphere, you can't beat 
the Corvette Diner 
(3946 5th Ave.). Check 
out "Tuesday Nite Out" 
discounts which vary at 
different restaurants and 
shops.

Downtown 
San Diego may 

not bustle with the same energy as 
New York or Los Angeles, but 
new nightclubs are always open-
ing and the downtown area has 
,'ecently become a relatively safe, 
fun place to be on a Friday or 
Saturday night. You can even take 
the trolley all the way to the border 
if you are feeling restless. 
DIrections 

Designed to capture the ambi-
ance of an outdoor market, Horton 
Plaza (4th and Broadway) has res-
taurants, a movie theater and de-
partment stores. For trendy clothes 
and shoes (Doc Martens and the 
like), check out Behind the Post 
Office (801 F St.). Also, explore 
thrift stores such as the Salvation 
Army (901 12th Ave.) and St. 
Vincent De Paul (1550 Market 
St.) for cheap deals on everything 
from blue jeans to eight-track 
tapes. 

The Old 
Spaghetti Fac-
tory (275 5th 
Ave.) is one of 
the oldest res-
taurants in San 
Diego and of-
fers affordable 
Italian food.

ings of movies you often can't see 
at the mainstream theaters. Cafe

Mekka Java(412 K St.) both offer 
a relaxing, living room atmo-
sphere. Cafe Lulu (419 F St.) 
makes a good late-night stop. Hot

morning helps ensure a good 
night 's sleep.

The Green Circle (827 F Street) 

houses some of the best dee-jays in 
town, and the small, austere club is 
a hip place to dance to acid jazz. Ole 
Madrid (751 5th Ave.) is also a 
popular place for dancing and at-
tracts the Eurostyle crowd. A new 
addition to the downtown scene is 
the E Street Alley (4th and EStreet) . 
A crowd often matriculates here, so 
be sure to arrive early. An added 
incentive to arrive early is the fact 
that you won't have to pay the $7 
cover charge (check to see what 
time the cover charge starts). 

Although it's not exactly down-
town, the Casbah (2812 Kettner 
Blvd.) is one of the best places to see 
live music. Alternative acts and lo-
cal bands often play in the club's 
small confines, and the ticket prices 
are reasonable. Be prepared for a 
late night, though. Headlining acts 
generally come on at about mid-
night. If you're looking for all-ages 
venues, there aren't many. The re-
cently-reopened SOMA (5305 
Metro Street) and the World Beat 
Center (1845 Hancock SI.) are two 
of the only clubs in town that admit 
patrons under 21.

.... " ... 

The Chelsea Girl shop (2683 
Via De La Valle) has vintage 
women's clothing and a comfy, 
personal touch. For other serious 
shopping, go to Del Mar High-
lands Center, where there's a 
Clothestime and Curves Sports-

wear. Guys probably have to go 
elsewhere. Also in Del Mar High-
lands is a health-oriented food 
store called Jimbos ... Naturally 
and a Barnes and Noble Book-
store for major browsing. The 
Flower Hill specialty shops are 
more for older folks . On the cor-

In search of java, try the

For franchise fans, Starbucks 
Coffeehouses have opened on 
Camino Del Mar and in Del Mar 
Highlands. 
Re ... r...u 

Del Mar boasts numerous 
great restaurants up and down 
the economic scale. For a super 
hot date, Epazotes (1555 Camino 
Del Mar) has Southwestern cui-
sine, a view of the Pacific and a 
few eye-popping prices on the 
menu . At the The Poseidon (1670 
Coast Blvd.), you can sit on the 
outside patio and enjoy the ocean 
view, even if all you can afford 
are those fish-shaped crackers. 
In the middle of the pack, Double 
Happiness (1011 Camino Del 

HIATUS 9 

Mar) and Kirby's Cafe (215 15th) 
are very good. Kirby's is a little 
pricey, but there is live music on 
weekends. 

Try Board and Brew (1212 
Camino Del Mar) for sand-
wiches, The Classic Malt Shop 
in the Flower Hill for burgers, 
Chevy's in Flower Hill for Mexi -
can and Funny Balloons and the 
Red Robin in Del Mar Highlands 
for buffalo wings. 
___ endfun 

AlthoVgh Del Mar is not a big 
rave scene, there are some fun 
spots for other activities. The 
Bonny Lad (2336 Carmel Valley 
Road) is a fairly authentic Epglish 
Pub, JJ Maguire's (225 Fifteenth) 
has young people and karaoke 
every night. Durante'sofDel Mar 
(2010 Jimmy Durante Blvd.) is 
the best sports bar in Del Mar, and 
Scalini's (3790 Via De La Valle) 
offers jazz. 

If you cross the border into 
Solana Beach, the Belly Up Tav-
ern (143 South Cedros Ave.) has 
an eclectic mix of cult, national 
and local artists. Flower Hill and 
Del Mar Highlands have theaters 
if you're the only one who hasn ' t 
seen Forrest Gump.

Nightlife for the adventurous , 

inally,you'reaway 
from home and the 

_.-- ever-watchful eye 
of your parents. Now 

is the time to .explore 
south of the border. 

Tijuana's a wonderful place if 
you' re not old enough to drink in 
the United States. However, be-
fore you head off to TJ with your 
dormmates like a pack of feral 
ferrets, there are a couple of things 
to remember. 

Tijuana is part of Mexico and 
the laws arc different and the jails 
are hideous. Avoid doing some-
thing stupid with a cop nearby, as 
pol ice in Tijuana arc corrupt. Even 
though the local government has 
tried to clean up its police force, 
there are still a few bad apples in 
the bunch. If you drive, either park 
on the U.S. side in a parking lot for 
$3 to $6 or zoom across the border 

D 

• .' . • 
and park in one of the various 
patrolled lots in Tijuana. If you 
park on the street in TJ, you may 
never see your car again. 

When crossing back into the 
U.S., leave the drugs, weapons 
and newfound Mexican friends in 
Mexico. Any of those things will 
result in the confiscation of your 
vehicle and you'll end up in the 
slammer - not a good start to 
your college career. 

The main strip to Tijuana's 
party life is Revoluci6n. Touted as 
the most-visited street in the world, 
it certainly lives up to its reputa-
tion. What follows is a list of vari-
ous clubs and places of interest on 
the famed Avenida:

various drink specials. 

Tecate Joe's (Av. Revoluci6n 
and Calle 2): Directly across the 
street from Peoples, this small 
place is always pumping with 
tunes. 

Jack inthe Box (Av. Revoluci6n, 
between Calle 2 and Calle 3): Just 
to show you that American capital-
ism will rule the world. Also a nice 
place to get a burger.

the favorite of a lot of people. Sev·

decent music. 

Red Square (Av. Revoluci6n

with the balls to play some alter-

out in a neo-Soviet sort of motif.

to the play list of 91X and Z90

The House (Calle 6, between

ensena 
A slower-paced 

city with 
incredible 

seafood, fine 
beaches and 

lively 
discos. 

t Tequila pop-pers, ticky-tacky souvenirs, one-night stands - the 
hangover from hell . Everyone, it 
seems, has a Tijuana slory .. 

Every weekend, norteamericano 
students pace the two-block stretch 
of Av. Revoluci6n - the grungy 
tourist district - to shop and drink 
themselves into oblivion. 

But as Southlanders know, the 
streets ofTJ arc anything but relax-
ing. The rock 'n' roll gringo club 
scene and party-'til-you-puke 
atmospehere sit uncomfortable 
against the desparation of this 
bordertown. And for those inter-

• • • • • 
ested in more thangettingshit-faced 
off Tequila poppers in some faux 
American club, there's another 
Mexico to explore. 

If you can sacrifice a weekend, 
the SO-mile trip to the port city of 
Ensenada, along the well-paved 
coastal highway, is a nice alterna-
tive to the oppresive streets of Av. 
Revoluci6n. 

Though a tourist boomtown (it 
has recently imported a fancy new 
Denny 's and mini-malls have 
sprouted up like weeds), Ensenada, 
unlike many gringo destinations, has 
escaped full -blown colonization. 
Things are slower paced and, in

Gelling to Ensenada is simple. 
From UCSD, drive south on 5 until 
you hit the border. With Mexican 
car insurance in hand, cross the bor-
der and follow the mad rush of traf-
fic until you see the sign for 
Ensenada, via highway 1. Be sure to 
take the coastal toll road (about $7 
each way). If you don't, you'll miss 
some spectacular views and per-
haps more importantly, havetobatlle 
with traffic on a winding, narrow 
and sometimes unnerving road.

After a 9O-minute ride, the high-

discos 10 fill a night and day.

If you like seafood, you're in the 
right place: Ensenada's fish market 
on the waterfront Blvd. Costero of-
fers some of the greatest assemblage 
of fish and crustaceans on the South-
west Coast - at rock bottom prices. 

While perusing the market, don ' t 
miss the opportunity to taste the catch 
of the day at the adjoining taco stands: 
fish, shrimp and other sea creatures 
wait to be adorned in salsa, cabbage, 

guacamole and lime juice. These are 
truly some of the best in Aztlan. 

AslightlywidervarietyofMexi-
can cuisine can be had at the super-
deluxe "taco stand" on the corner of 
Calle 2 and Av. Avarado. It offers 
fairly tasty and moderately-priced 
eats for weary gringo travellers. Pick 
up a taco, grab a beer and cool off in 
the court yard-and if you 're lucky,

someone will pay the inevitable free-

Good sit-down meals can be had 
at El 0Iarr0 (Av. Lopez, 47S), in the 
beart of the tourist district, for around 
$S a plate. And Mancos de Bahia de 
EnBenada(Av. RiverollatAv. LOpez 
Mateos), which is frequented by lo-
cals (a sure sign of it worthiness), 
offers fresh, affordable seafood for 
under $10. Numerous other resteu-
rants - some full-scale eateries, 
others nothing more than a small 
kitchen -line the streets between 
Av. LOpez Mateos and Av. Juarez. 
You won't go hungry. 
DIscoe 

While hopping, nightlife in 
Ensenada moves to a slower beat than 
that of Tijuana. A plethora of tourist-
dominated discos line the streets of 
L6pez Mateos, featurin~ M1!' -style 
music, relatively expensive dnnks and 
college students aplenty. A better 10-
cal-Iourist mix can be found on the 
southside of L6pez Mateos, where 
rock 'n' roll and Latin-style musics 
compete for airtime. 
........... 

Of course, Ensenada's beaches 
are the primary draw, the best of 
which are located directly south of 
town. EI Faro and Estero are among 
the most popular, offering fine, 
whitish sand,sometimes-decent surf 
and, best of all, the opportunity for 
beachside camping. Horses can be 
rented for about $10 an hour. To get 
to there, follow Av. I...Opez !"Iateos 
until you hit Av. Reforma (highway 
1) and watch for the turnoff. 

But be forewarned: If you are 
seeking peace and tranquility on that 
three-day holiday weekend, look 
elsewhere. EI Faro and Estero 
beaches promise to be lined with 
happy campers with precisely the 
same designs. 

More isolated beaches, however I 
do exist. The coastline is dotted with 
beaches both north and south of 
Ensenada. Some are just a hop, skip 
and a jump off the highway! while 
others require more extenSIVe ex-
ploration - often on Baja's rightly 
famous dirt roads. Buy a map and 
explore. 

And remember, unlike in the 
United States, where coastline is 
bought and sold to the highes~ bid-
der Mexico guarantees pubhc ac-

~ to its beaches - no Hotel Ritz, 
no bourgeoisie getaway camp can 
keep you from that pristine piece of 
ocean . 
.... to ...... 

Unless you're told otherwise, 
camping is permitted anyw~ere you 
can drive your tent stakes mto the 
sand. For outdoorish people, this is 
really what Baja is about - where 
else can you legally pitch your gear 
10 feet from the ocean? Not in el 
norte, that's for sure. 

However, if the though of twist-
ing and turning all night on a lumpy 

. bedofsandisunappr..aling,Ensenada 
offers a host of moderately-priced 
hotels from which to choose. AI EI 
Faro Beach Motel, modest, 
oceanview cabanas are available for . 
about SSO per night. . 

If that's way beyond your starv-
ing-student budget, cheaper and 
less extravagant rooms can be 
found downtown. Hotel Rosarito 
(Av. Gastelum, 263) is among the 
cheapest, rentingsmaU, simple and 
somewhat clean doubles for under 
$1S. In the tourist center, Hotel 
Plaza (Av. LOpez Matcos) offers 
cleaner and more lJIIIcioua rooma 
for around SlS.

Where Have 
You Gone, Tatu? 

He's not Deion Sanders or 
Wayne Gretzky. He's not Nolan 
Ryan or John Daly. But there's a 
player for the Dallas Sidekicks of 
the Continental Indoor Soccer 
League (CISL) whose name is 
Tatu. 

He doesn't play in large 
domed stadiums and his games 
are rarely broadcast on television 
Instead, Tatu plays about three 
games a week in front of 8,000 
fans in medium-sized arenas 
across the United States and 
Mexico. 

He's not leading the majors in 
homeruns or throwing the most 
touchdown passes each Sunday 
afternoon. Rather, Tatu is the 
leading scorer for the entire 
league, having led both the 
Sidekicks and the CISL in 
scoring for the last five years. 

The UCSD Guardiaa Tueeday, Sepa-ber 20, 19M 

CIIuck ~/GuMIIr! 

He doesn 't wear any gold 
jewelry or strut around the field. 
But Tatu is known for his 
flashiness around the goal. He 
often kicks shots in backwards, 
bicycle-sty Ie. Whenever he tallies 
a goal, he hugs his teammates, 
takes off his shirt and then flings 
it into the crowd. Finally, he 
obliges the cheering crowd by 
doing a victory lap around the 
arena.

It's Just Business as Usual 
He hasn ' t hit a homerun in the 

ninth inning of a World Series 
game. But in 1988, Tatu did 
engineer two dramatic come-
from-behind victories against the 
San Diego Sackers - scoring 
multiple goals in both games -
in order to extend the best-of-
seven championship series to a 
final game. The Sidekicks 
eventually won the 1988 
championship and have ~illCe 
captured two more titles, thanks 
mainly to the strong leg of their 
biggest star. 

WOMEN'S SOCCER: Second-ranked UCSD off to 
yet another undefeated start after tying Gators 

He doesn ' t have a personal 
trainer or a weight training 
specialist. Instead, Tatu practices 
with the Sidekicks for approxi-
mately four hours a day in a 
small indoor arena outside of 
town. He never misses a 
practice. 

He doesn' t play in a league 
rich in tradition, deeply grounded 
or labeled as "America's 
pastime." The Sidekicks have 
changed players, coaches, team 
colo rs, and leagues. What began 
in the Major Indoor Soccer 
League (MISL) with green 
jerseys evolved to the purple 
uniforms the Sidekicks sport in 
the CISL. About the only stable

It 's the same story, different 
season. The UCSD women's soc-
cer team , which has not lost a 
regular season game since 1992, 
has kept the streak 
alive with a 3-0-1 
start to the t 994 cam-
paign . 

Ranked number 
two in the country by 
the preseason College 
Sports magazine poll, 
the Tritons are com-
ing off a 17-1-1 sea-
son that saw them 
lose in overtime in the 
NCAA semifinals. 

Currently in the 
middle of a three-
game swing through 
Northern California, UCSD 
started the trip off with a 1 -1 tie 
at Division II San Francisco State 
on Saturday. Battling back against 
the Golden Gators , Triton 
midfielder Brandie Hayungs ' un-
assisted goal in the 84th minute 
tied the game. Thirty minutes of 
overtime failed to change the 
score. 

UCSD demonstrated why it is 
the second-ranked team in the 
country with a 3-] win on Sept.

14 against another Division II 
team, Cal Poly Pomona. The Tri-
tons dominated the first half of the 
contest, controlling the ball in 
Pomona territory so often that 
UCSD goalkeeper Cari Schwartz 

didn't face a Pomona 
shot until only 1 :56 re-
mained in the first half. 
The Tritons had a big 
speed advantage with 
forwards such as junior · 
Carin Pugh and sopho-
more Elli Johnson, as 
well as an aggressive 
midfield that was al-
ways on the attack. 

That speed enabled 
UCSD to control the 
ball in the corners and 
send it across the goal 
box seemingly at will 

during the first 45 minutes of the 
game. But the Tritons were unable 
to record many shots on goal and 
had to rely on corner kicks to 
notch their first half scores. 

The first goal came at 20:59, 
after Kelly Kramer received the 
ball near the top left corner of the 
penalty box. She fired a shot that 
came within inches of the goal 
post, forcing Bronco keeper Dawn 
Williams to dive for the ball and

Tritons Trying to Avoid a 
Repeat of 1992 Blues 
SPECTRE OF A DISASTER: Defending NCAA champs stumble in early 
going, must regain championship form to escape missing the postseason 
By BrIIn K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

As the 1993 NCAA defending 
national champions, the UCSD 
men's soccer team could be star-

ing down 
the barrel of 
a repeat sea-
son, but it 
may not be 
the precious 
double they 
so desper-
ately long 
for. 

A mere 
three years 
ago in 1991, 
UCSD cap-
tured its 

second men's soccer National 
title, ravaging enemy goal cages 
with one of the natiolt's most po-
tent offenses and smothering op-
posing offenses with a defense 
more impenetrable than Fort 
Knox. 

Then came 1992 - the dark 
year. Saddled with a relatively 
young, inexperienced squad, an 
anemic offense , and a schedule 
difficult enough to make Atlas 
flinch, the defending champion 
Tritons' fall from grace was any-
thing but poetic. 

After fini shing the season a dis-

mal 8-6-4 and failing to even 
qualify for the postseason , UCSD 
could only pray for a savior. 

Enter 6 ' 4" forward Chris 
Romey, the leading scorer for the 
'91 Triton squad, who returned to 
San Diego after a brief hiatus to 
the University of Washington. The 
" big guy" decimated rival de-
fenses for the '93 cast, converting 
a slew of vicious headers and un-
stoppable rifle shots to the comers 
of his choosing. The defense, an-
chored by brilliant goal keeper 
Michael Madden, left even the 
most productive of offenses cry-
ing for mercy. Once again UCSD 
rolled to an NCAA title . Peace and 
harmony had returned to 
Tritondom. 

Well, here we go again. Gone 
from the '94 cast is Romey. Mad-
den, during a seemingly harmless 
preseason jog on the beach, suf-
fered a possible cartilage tear to 
his left knee and could be out for 
five weeks. Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong has been forced to rely 
on relatively inexperienced sopho-
more George Allison as his lone 
net minder. 

"This is definitely a different 
team than the one we had last 
year," Assistant Coach Ted 
Przybylek said. "Last year we 
would throw the ball up and pl ay 

a lot off of ~omey's head. This 
year we are more of a passing 
team. We have gone from a team 
of tall front guys to little guys who 
are excellent at handling the ball 
and splitting defenses. We have to 
beat you with speed &nc ~ ~· ill. It 's 
not power ball, it's more s ~.'ccer. 

Yet after the first StX games , & 
the '94 season, it appears to be f: r 
less soccer. The defending champs 
have amassed a lackluster record 
of 3-3, the offense has lacked fi n-
ishing power and the traditionally 
rock-solid defense has shown a 
few cracks. 

"Yeah, we have been struggling 
since our first game (a 6-1 wallop-
ing of Point Loma)," senior for-
ward Todd Curran said . "At the 
beginning our chemistry wasn ' t 
there. Our defense had some holes 
and we couldn't put the ball away 
[on the offensive side) . 
[Armstrong] has tried several new 
lineups and combinations and it 
just didn ' t seem to click right off." 

Armstrong even went so far as 
to move 6'3" midfielder Brian 
Turner to Romey'S old position to -
try to bring back some of the old 
magic, but that experiment back-
fired. 

"We don ' t play that style of 
soccer this year," przybylek said .

Triton Cross Country Makes 
Tracks at Aztec Invitational 
IN A PACK: Castner and ~mith lead youthful UCSD squads to top-ten finishes 

GuMdi .. File PtIoto 
J.J. C .. tne, (47) led UCSD at this w .. kend'. Aztec Invitational. 

By TecIcI UdcI 
Associate Sports Editor 

However politically incorrect it 
may sound, male dominance is 
back at UCSD. And the 1994 Tri-

ton men's 
cross coun-
try squad 
proudly 
trumpets 
its return. 

M a k e 
no mis-
take, this 
was not 
about old-
fashioned 
sexism. 
Instead, 

the UCSD men stomped over fa-
miliar ground at the 51st annual 
Aztec Cross Country Invitational 
held last Saturday at Balboa Park. 

Feeling at home on the eight-
kilometer trails, the Triton men not 
only took fifth place overall, but 

also frequently left Division I ath-
letes and sneaker·sponsored run-
ners willowing in their dust. 

"We feel like we have an ideal 
blend of returning athletes and 
newcomers," said UCSD cross 
cou ntry Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale. 

The Triton tracksters were led 
by veteran J.J. Castner, a IOJ;g-dis-
tance guru of sorts, who is also a 
multi-talented track standout dur-
ing the spring seasons. 

With a phenomenal time of 
26:04, Castner captured third 
place overall. His time earned him 
an unofficial second-place honor 
as well, since he was the second 
true collegian to cross the finish 
line. 

The top-two men 's finishers 
were MebrahtQm KefJezigh of 
UCLA, followed by Robert 
Nelson of Asics Track West spon-
sorship.

L-______________________________________________ ~ 

'by teammate Castner, junior John 
Walsh also chalked up a strong 
performance for the Triton men. 

Walsh ran strong enough to 
make the top 20, sprinting to a 
26:53 time and a 19th-place fin-
ish. • 

"We're very fortunate to have 
such great leadership this year," 
Van Arsdale sa.id. "Walter 
[Dehority] shows everyone how to 
run with pain, and Nate Johnson 
leads because he's such a strong 
character. " 

UCSD's Neal Harder and 
Gavin Klinger took 36th and 37th 
place with times of 27:49 and 
27:50, respectively. 

Rounding out the men's scor-
ing were Dehority, Mike Wallace 
and Greg Field, who finshed with 
amazingly close marks of 27:52, 
27:55 and 28:37. 

Perhaps the most intriguing as-
pect of the UCSD men's final re-
sults, however, was not evident in 
specific individual marks. 

All seven male Tritons-
Castner included-achieved times 
within 2:33 of each other. Thus it 
was with [emarkable team consis-
tency that the UCSD men's squad 
thumped their opponents. 

"We try to race in a pack," said 
Van Arsdale. "It gives us a defi-
nite strength as a team." 

The UCSD women's cross 
country squad did some thumping 
of their own in Saturday's festivi-
ties. 

Led by freshman phenom 
Kyndra Smith's perfect vision-
a 20:20 lime - and a 43rd-place 
finish, the Triton women jaunted 
to a respectable ninth-place over-
all team mark. 

"We had a good recruiting yeal', 
especially on the women's sidt, '~ 
Van Arsdale said. kWe have a lot 
of talented youth, as evident in 
Kyndra (Smith]." 

Second on the UCSD 
women's squad was three-year 
veteran Jane Zimmerman, who 
garnered a 50th place finish with 
a time of 20:40, 

"The women are rapidly im-
proving. We hive a four-year pro-
gram here in cross country, so the 
veterans, such as Jlne 
Zimmerman. reilly help bring the 
rest of the women I\ong," Slid Van 
Arsdlle. 

Also galloping well along the 
five-kilometer trail were Tritons 
Melissa Roberts (20:48), Jessie 
Therrilult (20:54). Liana Wright 
(21 :27). and Karen Hinkle 
(21:32). 

"It was a difficult course and 
our women did very well," said 
Van Arsdale. "Like the men, they 
were also grouped closely to-

Saturday's 2-1 clocking of the 
visiting Claremont College Mus-
tangs may have been the pick-me-
up the '94 Tritons needed to get the 
'92 spectre off their shoulders. 

"We really pulled together as a 
team," Curran said. "I think it is a 
definite sign of things to come." 

Armstrong~ for one, hopes so. "It 
was an excellent game. The season 
was on the line, if we had lost this 
one we probably would have had 
too many losses [four for Division 
III teams] to get into the playoffs. 
We looked a lot sharper today." 

Follawing a see-saw battle for 
control in the first half with both 
squads squandering scoring oppor-
tunities, UCSD exploded early in 
the second 45 minutes of play. 

At the 54:04 mark, junior for-
ward Ken Fujii adeptly dribbled to

stride with a picl1lre-perfect touch 
pili at the top of the goalie box. 
With the defender at his back and 
the Mustang goalie charging, 
Hetherington coolly bluted a bul-
let into the upper-right comer of the 
cage to aive the ailing Triton offense 
a 1-0 advantage. 

A 5'7" turbo booster, Fujii 
hounded the taller Mustang defense 
with his lightning-quick stops and 
masterful ball handling skills. And 
at the 79:06 mark he, too, found the 
back of the net. 

With 5'2" sophomore midfielder 
Jose Ocampo running circles around 
the Claremont defense on the left 
sideline, Fujii found an opening on 
the upper-left comer of the box. An 
Ocampo touch pass later. Fujii 
swiftly ricocheted a line-drive off 
the right post past helpless Mustang 
goalie Tyler Snow. 

Although Patrick Gorgue pock-
eted an unassisted lower-left comer 
scorcher past Triton goalie George 
Allison with only 45 seconds re-
maining, UCSD walked away from 
the contest with high hopes.

"We struggled early on, but I 
think we turned the comer today. If 
you look at our scHeluIe, we have 
had to play four games in six days 
with no practices between games to 
regroup. I think we're on track 
again." 

They can't afford not to be. The 
Tritons face a daunting schedule 
against some of the Division III 
elites, not to mention the likes of 
Westmont College (a perennial 
NAiA powerhouse) and Division I 
squads Cal and USD. 

Pile that on top of current losses 
to fellow Division III foes The 
Muter's College (1-0 on Sept. 7), 
Azusa Pacific (1-0 on Sept. 9) and

TATUs A nation 
turns its lonely eyes 
to you 
ContInued from pace 18 
Tatu. 

He doesn'tilo Nike commercials 
or sell soda on TV Rather, Tatu 
coaches a 14-and-under boy's soc-
cer team in his spare time because 
he says he ought to share his favor-
ite sport with America's youth, 

He doesn't do speaking engage-
ments for thousands .of dollars. 
When Tatu is not coaching or play-
ing, he makes appearances for Dal-
las charities, selling the sport of soc-
cer and signing free autographs. 

He doesn't relax in the off-sea-
son. During the sizzling-hot Dallas 
summers, Tatu runs outdoor soccer 
camps for local kids interested in his 
favorite sport. He knows that soc-
cer is not as popular as other sports 
in the United States, but he says that 
he can eventually change thlt. 

He doesn't carry a name like P'ele 
or play in front of millions of fans. 
He doesn't play soccer for the 
money. Tatu plays it for his love of 
the game. 

Tatu, the highest paid player in 
the CISL, made $12,000 last year. 

So listen closely the next time ' 
you hear someone talk about the 
baseball strike. Remember the ne"t 
time you hear Donald Fehr com-
plaining about unfair players' sala-
ries or Bud Selig talking about the 
suffering owners. 

Try to remember the next time 
you read about a .230 hitter whining 
for an -c"tra million dollars tacked 
on to his already bloated salary or 
the next time you see a player like 
Wade Boggs - a Red So" player 
-- become a New York Yankee be-
cause he earns more money. 

Don't forget the next time you 
hear someone like Kenny Rogers, 
the only lefty in baseball history to 
pitch a' perfect game, comment on 
the baseball strike, saying, "I don't 
care, I'm playing golf right now." 

Remember the next time a base-
ball player signs autographs for 
enormous sums of money or the next 
time he complains he's worth more 
than he's being paid. 

Try not to forget the nine lives of 
Steve Howe, and how he'd be injail 
right now if he were an ordinary per-
son and not a baseball player. 

Remember the next time you go 
to a game and the star player is in-
jured with a blister and you have to 
put a down payment on a four-dol-
lar beer. 

Remember the last time there 
wasn't a World Series - in 1904. 
Remember the reasons why players 
played baseball during those times. 

Don't forget the next time you see 
a wealthy. baseball player beat his 
wife, throw firecrackers at people, 
solicit a prostitute or say "Let L.A. 
bum." 

Remember Joe DiMaggio, who 
played despite an aggravated bone 
spur in his heel. Remember sports-
writers who say a player is going to 
have a big year because his contract 
is almost up, not because the player 
wants to play hard. 

Remember the wealthy owners 
who build luxury boxes and mod-
ernistic stadiums with retractable 
roofs and Astroturf, and then fail to 
meet a simple budget. Remember 
owners who unload entire teams -
veterans, stars and all-just to make 
more money so they can sell the 
tearn at a profit. 

Remember all these thinp, be-
cause the next time anyone says any-
thing about baseball, do me a favor. 

Tell them about Taw.

Tritons Take Bite Out Of 
Panthers in Straight Sets 
NUMBER ONE: UCSD womenst volleyball has gotten off to a fast start with a 6-0 
record against'Div. III opponents and a #1 ranking in the NCAAs Western Division 
By D8n Kr8ft 
Sports Ct>-Editor 

Coming off a tremendous 1993 
campaign in which it finished fourth 
in the NCAA Division III playoffs, 
the UCSD women's volleyball team 
opened the 1994 season with high 

hopes. 
So far, 

through the 
first eight 
matches, the 
Tritons 
haven't dis-
appointed. 

After a 
convincing 
victory.. over 
highly-
ranked 
Chapman 
University, 
the Tritons 

have ascended the rankings to take 
their place at the top of the NCAA 
Division III Western Region with an 
overall record of 6-2. 

UCSD's team is a perfect blend 
of youth and experienc.e, led by sec-
ond team All-Americans Julie 
Harvey and Kristi Askeland. Jenni-
fer Cross, in tandem with fellow ~e­
nior and co-captain Askeland, form 
the heart of the Tritons' solid middle 
blocking corps. 

Fifth-year senior seller Jennifer 

Schofield, who red-shirted last sea-
son, will be in command ofUCSD's 
offense. Despite the Tritons' early 
success, Schofield has her work cut 
out for her as she attempts to create 
a cohesive unit of the three newcom-
ers and the three returning veterans 
who make up the starting lineup. 

The new faces in UCSD's start-
ing rotation this season are junior 
college transfer Angelle Crochet, 
sophomore Madelyn Ripkin and 
Schofield. 

"We have four strong seniors in 
the starting lineup and good team 
leadership," Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said. "Our strength is in 
our complete team, though." 

The backbone of the Tritons' 
squad is its five returning sopho-
mores. With a year of experience 
under their belts and a wealth of ath-
letic ability and hustle, tliey could 
very well be the difference between 
a good team and a national title con-
tender, 

"Of the 13 players on the team, 
seven are freshman and sopho-
mores," Dannevik said, "and all of 
our younger players have great ath-
letic ability." 

The Tritons have taken positive 
early-season steps toward that ulti-
mate goal by winning six of their 
first eight contests. Their only de-
feats came on the road at the hands 

of Division 11 opponents Cal State 
University Bakersfield (15-7, 15-8, 
15-3) on Sept. 12 and UC Riverside 
(15-5,15-12, 15-13) on Sept. 16. 

While UCSD has struggled un-
derstandably with its Division II 
opponents, it has had lillie trouble 
disposing of fellow Division III 
teams, posting a perfect 6-0 mark in 
those contests, including a dominat-
ing performance against the Panthers 
of Chapman University. 

The Tritons travelled to Chapman 
on Saturday evening to do bailie 
with the Panthers, who were no 
doubt hungry to prove themselves 
worthy of UCSD's number-one 
ranking. The Tritons slammed the 
door on those hopeS, however, with 
a straight-set dismantling of the Pan-
thers. 

UCSD was a bit slow out of the 
blocks, trailing 14-11 late in the 
opening game of the contest before 
coming to life. After battling back 
to a 14-alltie, the Tritons closed out 
Chapman to take a one-game-to-
none lead with a 16-14 opening 
game tally. 

"Chapman really deserved to win 
that first game," Dannevik said, "but 
we hung in there late and made a nice 
comeback." 

As the match wore on, UCSD 
continued to grow stronger, running 
away with games two and three with

Tueeday, Septe.ber 20, 1994 

w. SOCCER: 
Three wins and a tie 
to kick off the season 
ContInued .,.. ..... 28 
eked a DOl" over Schwartz and 
into tbe net. 

UCSO Head Coach Brian 
McManus was happy enough with 
his team's effort. "I thought we did 
well by creating a lot of chances, 
and we finished tbose chances bet-
ter than we had in the first two 
games,· he said. 

While acknowledging tbe Tri-
tons' drop in intensity after inter-
mission, McManus was not overly 
concerned, explaining it as a lack 
of "game fitness" this early in the 
year. 

"I was reasonably pleased, at 
least for this stage of the season. 
As we go along though, we're go-
ing to have to raise our game ev-
ery week," he said. 

The Cal Poly Pomona victory 
completed tbe Pomona sweep for 

the Tritons, who bad dispatched 
Pomona-Pitzer, 2-0, on Sept. ll. 
Two-thirds of UCSO's Johnson 
trio - EIIi, Amanda and Lauren 
- scored for the Tritons, with 
Amanda and Elli knockina the ball 
into the net. 

The corner kick was the 
weapon of choice for the Tritons 
yet again. While Pomona took 
only one, UCSO fired off 13. 

The first goal CAme at tbe 12: 12 
mark, off I corner kick from the 
left side when Amanda Johnson 
fired the ball into the top left cor-
ner. 

The second goal came in the 
86th minute when Lee's corner 
kick made its way from Carrie 
Peer to Elli Johnson, wbo tapped 
it in from the center of the goal 
box. 

The Sagehens were lucky to 
escape only two goals down, 
UCSO peppered Pomona-Pitzer 
goalkeeper Sabri Morrison with 
14 shots. Schwartz, on the other 
hand, had no reason to wash her 

The UCSD Cuardiaa 

uniform after the game. The jun-
ior keeper faced just three shots, 
all in the second half and all off 
the foot of the Sagehens' Monique 
Oleaniewicz. 

That triumph followed UCSO's 
season-opening win, I 3-0 victory 
over Cal Baptist in Riverside. Tri-
tons Kramer, Pugh and Jennifer 
Ewert all scored for UCSO. 

On paper, the 1994 season 
should be an even better year than 
was 1993. The Tritons' nucleus, 
dominated by freshmen and 
sopbomores the last couple of sea-
sons, is a year older and more ex-
perienced . 

As usual for a McManus-
coached team, this year's Triton 
squad will be offense-oriented. 
With the speed of Elli Johnson and 
Pugh on the outside, UCSD will 
be sending long balls up the side-
lines as much as possible. 

The midfielders have always 
been as much a part of the offense 
as the forwlrds, and with Amanda 
Johnson having already tallied two 
goals, this year should be no dif-
ferent. 

SPORTS 31 

While the offense grabs much 
of the headlines, the Triton de-
fense is alwlys the key to the 
team's success. Lee quarterbacks 
the team from her fullback spot 
while Oiana Muchowski and Car-
rie Peer both enter thei~ third year 
as starters. 

Chuck Ncuyen/ Guam/an 
Amandll JohnIon ".nl and bears It while hudl", the ball downf\eld. 

The addition of talented new-
comers Beth Freeburg and 
Marciela Oceguera will only rein-
force the already solid defensivc 
wall. 

Muchowski have been staples of 
the starling lineup since their 
freshmen years. 

For the third straight year, 
McManus has been blessed with 
a talented group of freshmen who 
figure to come in and make an im-
mediate impact. Freeburg, 
Oceguera and Larsen are all part 

While Lee, Heather Sears and 
Daphne Farnum are the only se-
niors on the team, juniors such as 
Pugh, Amanda Johnson, Peer and

There is no doubt as to the Tri-
tons ' expectations for this year. 
"The regular season is just 15 
games of preseason," McManus 
said.
