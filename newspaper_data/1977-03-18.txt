Bill Urges UC Fee Hike Re~al 
Resolution Not Expected to Influence Regents, Though 

by H ..... MelntOlh 
Staff Cerrespoadeat 

A resolution asking the UC Board 
of Regents to rescind the proposed 
registration fee increase is moving 
through the state Legislature, but 
it is doubtful the resolution will 
have much effect on the Regents. 

The resolution, sponsored by 
Assembly member Tom Bates (D-
Oakland), was approved by the 
Assembly Subcommittee on Post-
Secondary Education last week by 
a vote of s-G. It now goes to the 
Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee. 

" I really don't think the 
resolution will make the Regents 
change their minds," Bates said. 
"But I think the Legislature should 
go on record as opposed to the 
increase." 

The resolution requests the 
Regents to rescind the $48 increase 
in the annual registration fee 
scheduled for this fall. It requests 
that future registration fee irr 
creases be allowed only on those ' 
campuses which need them. 

The resolution also requests that 
each campus registration fee 
committee have equal authority to 
their chancellor in deciding fee 
levels within limits set by the 
Regents. 

"The University is not opposed to 
the resolution," said Lowell Paige, 
special assistant to the UC 
President. Paige added, however, 
"It is the best of my belief that the 
Regents will not rescind the in-
crease." 

William Coblentz, chairperson of 
the Board of Regents, said he did 
not know whether the Board would 
reverse itself on the increase. "To 
be polite, anything that the 
Legislature does certainly 
deserves consideration," he saia. 

Ba~s said the resolution is 
concerned with two issues: local 
campus control and student in-
volvement in fee increases. 

Each campus should be able to 
set its own registration fee levels, 
he said, adding that some of the 
campuses do not need" a $48 in-
crease to pay for their fee funded 
programs. 

Students-should be able to decide 
whether they want to increase the 
regUttration fee or cut back on 
programs, Bates said. At 
Berkeley, the registration fee 
conunittee wanted to cut programs 
before raising fees. But the 
President followed the Charr 
cellor's recommendation to in-
crease the fee. 

Each registration fee committee 
has a majority of students on it, but 
represents the entire campus 

community. Currently, they can 
only advise the chancellor who has 
the sole power to recommend 
registration fee levels to the 
President. 

UC has had some sort of 
registration fee since 1921. In 1968 
it was increased to the present 
level of $300 per year. The fee is to 
be used for services " which benefit 
the student and which are com-
plimentary to, but not part of, the 
instru~tional programs."

McElroy OKs Councils' 
TransitionTeam Power 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

Chancellor McElroy issued formal recognition Monday of the newly 
elected ASUCSD declaring it to be " The official form of student gover-
nance at UCSD," based on it receiving 51.7 percent of the validated 
ballots in last week's student referendum. 

Additionally, McElroy approved the document entitled " Quad College 
Council Resolution : Scope-Responsibilities of the UC San Diego Tran-
sition Team." "I endorse and agree with these decisions and look forward 
to working with the Transition Team and , ultimately, the ASUCSD," the 
Chancellor said in his statement to the press. 

The first Transition Team meeting, held Monday afternoon, brought 
"members of the Coop who were irritated because they were not included 
in the Transition Team," said Margo Chaney, Team member. Sulr 
sequently, three persons were added to the group, which now totals 

sev~n. Kate S~livan of the Student .Activity Fee Support Group, Kevin 
CahIll of AppOIntments aod EvaluatIons, and Student Cooperative Union 
co-Chair Sue Stanfield were designated to serve on the Team during the 
interim period of student government. 

The interim group made decisions on several issues concerning the 
upcoming ASUCSD elections. Balloting will take place Wed ., through Fri. 
of the third week of Spring Qtr. , Apr. 20 - 22. Applications and guidelines 
for candidates will be available from EDNA Mon., April 4 and will be due 
Mon. of the second week of the quarter. Required of each candidate will 
be an overall GPA of 2.0 and a 100 word statement of relevant pasrex-
perience and statement of intent," according to Chaney. 

The financing of the elections is 
"very W1sure right now," said 
Chaney. Stanfield felt that " one of 
the biggest mistakes made in the 
last elections was that there were 
no provisions made for funding. We 
are still trying to find a resource 
for funding the elections." It has 
been determined that the elections 
will cost about $2500, but the group 
has " no idea where it's going to 
come from," admitted Stanfield. 

There are " a lot of things that 
have to be determined within the 
AS constitution," said Stanfield. 
Mentioning that the Transition 
Team has already decided that 
Coop support groups should be kept 
operative during the iuterim 
period. " It would be easier to let 
the coordinators of the support 
groups go through with the l>aper 
work than to let the Transition 
Team take care of it," Stanfield 
felt. 

ArchibaldCox 
Joins UC's 
Bakke Team 

It was announced Monday that , 
former Watergate special 
prosecutor Archibald Cox will join 
three other UC lawyers in arguing 
the Bakke case before the US 
Supreme Court. 

In choosing Cox, ' the University 
went against the wishes of various 
civil rights groups, who felt it was 
necessary to appoint a minority 
attorney to the case. 

The Bakke case deals with the 
"constitutionality" of allowing 
special admissions programs for 
minorities. 

CP~ Will Halt Saturday 
Night Flicks Next Quarter 

byM~Brien 
Staff Writer 

The Campus Program Board (CPB) has decided to terminate its 
showing of Saturday night films and change its Friday night film series 
because of financial problems, according to Pat Whitlock, chairperson of 
CPB's Film Subcommittee. 

Whitlock explained that the new policy, which is to take effect next 
quarter, is being implemented because CPB lost nearly $2,000 last 
quarter, and expects a similar deficit for this quarter. Whitlock, a Third 
College senior, assured students however, that the board will continue to 
show films along with short cartoons and newsreels most Friday nights, 
and that student organizations will be encouraged to present movies on 
Saturday nights and remaining Fridays.

Timothy Leary 
Is Alive... And 
Here Tomorrow 

by Alan Russell 
NeWlEdItor 

A voice from the past spoke to 
me Tuesday in a telephone in-
terview - or Is it a voice of the 
future? 

Dr. Timothy Leary, Harvard 
Professor turned 60s "Guru of 
~D," and now a 70s "futurist," 
is a man of "spaced out" ideas-
literally. 

"We're going to space," said 
Leary. "We W&Ja to go, to lead 
the new .. th. There are 10 many 
reasons to migrate. It will be a 
better place to ,row, to raile 
children, to make love." 

To mUe love! What's Leary 
talldnlabow? 

''Sbnply ..,.klnl, I'm in-
wlwld with a 8I'OUP (Space

S.M.I.L.E.) that's raialng corr 
scIousness, thM wtll be leaWtg 

earth by 1990, and branching out 
into space." 

Calling this movement the 
" third industrial revolution," 
Leary claims he's not afraid of 
being labeled as an "escapist," a 
term that was pinned on him 
previously for his drug use, and 
follows him now in his space 
plans. 

The Ia&eDegeat MJcrated 
"It is the intelligent people who 

have always migrated," said 
Leary. "They escaped from 
situaUoNl that limited them. As 
our ancaton left Europe to come 
here to America, producing a 
better race, a more intew,ent 
chlnce orleated and civWzed 
people, so shall we migrate from 
earth." 

WIdIe talklnl with Leary, one is 
luUed by his gentle voice, lulled 
that is until he makes some 
startling statement, the kind of 
whlcb OCCIB'S about every other 

line. "We are earning our own 
money for this venture, not 
asking the government," said 
Leary. " But there will soon come 
that day where just as America 
takes care of the world, so shall 
the space migrants cherish, 
protect, and help earth." 

Emphasizing his lecture this 
Saturday evening at 7:30 in the 
gym. Leary noted the " important 
aspects" his talk would cover. 
"Keith HeMOn, a top authority in 
his field, will give a detailed slide 
show projecting the future . 

"In addition to giving a 
description of the GOa, the most 

~rtara and milWlderstood 
decade in hwnan hiltocy, I will 
bring in some neuro-electric 
technicla.. from Los Angeles 
who will attempt to use signals in 
bringing about irreversible

Leary quipped tt.t, "So far my

blames onAudi~Visual (AV.)

Herbert Vilakazi, Essex County 
College, Newark, New Jersey 
(excerpt taken from a speech by 
Vilakazi upon his return from 
South Africa last year.) 

In South Africa, a more severe 
form of racial discrimination 
exists than anywhere on the globe. 
ThIs policy of systematic op-
pression is called apartheid. 

The French paper L'Express 
quoted the Prime Minister of South 
Africa, John Vorster, as saying, 
"Apartheid? It is not a problem, it 
is a solution. Our philosophy of 
separate development rests on 
only' one factor ; we are different. 
Whites, we want to stay white. 
Blacks, they want to stay black. 
We preserve our identity, and they 
theirs." 

This type of "ethnic preser-
vation" effectively denies to 
blacks, colol1ldos, and Indians 
basic democratic rights, making 
life for the 20 million majority 
people in South Africa quite bad, 
often hellish: For the whites, who 
number four million, life is op-
pulent and luxurious. The standard 
of living for these whites is among 
the highest in the world. 

The white run industries in South 
Africa make great profits owing to 
that country's vast supply of 
valuable resources and slavishly 
cheap labor. For those with an eye 
on profit, South Africa is a literal 
goldmine.

'Shades of Gray' in Rape Cases; 
It is a Question of Consent 
'Until several years ago, I 

blilieved that the crime of rape was 
an act in which the rapist was 
either clearly innocent or clearly 
guilty. 

But one day I read about a case 
showing that there are shades of 
grey, border line cases if you 
please, between innocence and 
guilt. 

It was the story of a man who , 
went to a singles bar for the ex-
press purpOse of finding a woman 
to have sex with. He found what he 
wanted, but the ' next day to his 
surprise, the police arrested him 
and charged him with rape. 

His side of the story was that 
although she (his lover) never said 
or did a single thing to indicate that 
she didn 't want to have sex with 
him. 

In court, she testified that 
although it was true that she never 
gave the man any indication that 
she did not want to have sex with 
him, it was only because she was 
far too drunk to give any indication 
of anything. 

The prosecutor argued that a 
man commits rape anytime he 
does not have the woman's ex-
press, or (more frequently) im-
plied consent. The man's attorney 
argued that when a woman sulr 
mits to sex without giving any 
indication that she does not wish to 
have sex, she has thereby implied 
consent. 

The question -is: is this man 
actually guilty of rape; or was he 
merely an average guy on the 
make? What do you think?

Schneider: 'I Have a Deep Respect for Student Integrity' 
My name is Andy ~hneider. 1 am a person, Sometimes I 

communicate well, other times I need the support of con-
structive criticism. My greatest fear right now is that the 
students of this campus don't have enough respect to listen 
to each other. 

I have been attacked for not having a political ideology 
and for playing a political game. My principle has been 
very clear from the start. Student government should serve 
all students. Student government should be open to the 
participation of all students. My activity and effort has 
continually centered on this value. 

When a Task Force to design student governance models 
was created h.y the administration during the summer, I 
worked to pre·'Eflt student funding of this project. When it 
was clear tha, • would be funded, I stood alone insisting 
that there would be student hearings and that no referen-
dum should b ! tonducted until every student had the op-
portunity to participate. 

When the CII rellor called lor an administration con-
trolled election, I was the first to reJect liuch II ~rge, 
challenge this !\Iluse to student rights, and vocally attack 
the Chancellor iI) the campus mf><iia. 

When I be<.aJtle External Affairs Coordinator, it was 
clear to me that important statewide policy decisions were 
not being brot.g~t to the students for their input and critical 
review. Every decision that I have made has been open to 
the discussion of students in the COOP, students on the 
College CoWlCils, students on campus wide committees, 
and every student willing to talk about the issue. My vote on 
the President's CouncUls not what Andy thinks, but it Is a 
vote of the collective expression of the students from San 
Diego. I have made it a practice to send a copy of 
everything that has been written on policy, projects, and 
action to the COOP, College Councils and the media. The 
f!l s are open to all students. 

When I was a lobby intern in Sacramento, I did not sup-
port a political faction . I provided Information and I su 

.; 
assistance to radicals, moderates and conservatives, alike. 
I did not at any time exclude a student who needed 
something. 

I am not committed to the advancement of a singular 
political ideology. I believe in the free flow of ideas and 
concerns. Student government should not be controlled by a 
single special interest group which works to eliminate the 
participation of students who hold differing views. All 
students should have the equal opportunity to share in the 
decision making process. A course of action should be 
selected by the majority , drawing from a wide range of 
opinions, positions and perspectives. Only when all students 
have the fair chance to give this input can a government be 
called representative . 

I have given of myself to projects that would benefit this 
campus. I did it because I saw an unfulfilled student need 
that could be answered with just a little time, organization 
and cooperation together. I wanted to share with others the 
task of doing something positive for UCSD. 

We spent countless hours lobby{ng for the completion of 
the UCSD cluster colleges. Unless every college has its own 
set of buildings that students can call their home we will 
lose the special character of having small student com-
mWlities. If Third College was to survive as a unified 
student community we needed the Step II bulldlngs that 
would complete the campus. We lobbied legislators, state 
department officials, and Regents . 

The President's Council reversed a long standing position 
and requested that the Student Lobby help in the struggle ... 
Well, we got that money from the state, and Third College 
will be completed. Getting the buildings for Fourth College 
is just down the road. can we get ourselves organized, will 
you help us? What if we could raise the money so that each 
college could have its own recreational facilities, as well as 
a place for commuter students to work and congregate? 

We have reviewed th systemwide library planning 
report that propo es lo move a good part of the books in our 

library to warel10uses in Los Angeles in the name of cost 
effectiveness. That part of the plan is ridiculous and we are 
the only student voice against it. Will you help us? 

There is a real problem with student representation on 
campus - wide committees. Students don't really make 
decisions, they are polite window dressings. We are 
working to make sure these reps are responsible and that 
they have our support. Will you help? 

~ Recently the President of the University chose to raise 
your· tuition. Maybe because of inflation the fees had to go 
up, but our position all along has been that students should 

'decide what they are willing to pay (or. It is our money, we 
should control it. The President's Council is fighting this 
struggle in the legislature: Will you help? 

I CQuld go on and on about things we need to do, In the past 
I have seen the students on this campus loose. Our 
disorganization has allowed administrators to make our 
decisions for us ... it has to stop. The time has come to stand 
up for student rights ... the time has corne to fight for 
student interest. Not the student interests of the few who 
run the government, but the student interests of the campus 
as a whole . For the first time look and see the vast potential 
of student cooperation and shared effort. 

I have been attacked as an opportunist. Yes, I am op-
portunistic. Opportunistic for what the students 00 tlU 
campus might achieve if we can work together. 

I will run for President of the ASUCSD. I do DQt want to 
run a govenunent, that is a task that we should aU share. I 
want to say that I am willing to work for the students. I am 
willing to be run by the consensus will of the student body. 

I have a deep respect for student Integrity. Because I 
have worked on mall)' projects with many students, I hJve 
gained a knowledge, information and skill that could be 
abused for my own self interest, but I am offering what I 
have gained to you. 

I.el the old struggles die. Let us allow common dreams 
for the future to become a reality. .

T A Situation Is Deteriorating 

Boy, what a .ace fellow -that 
Manny Rotenberg is! He sure is out 
to protect the interests of both the 
graduate student TAs and the 
undergraduate students who face a 
worsened studentl'l'A ratio next 
year. Not only does he want to 
maintain T A . salaries at 50 per 
cent, instead of 45 per cent, for 50 
per cent employment, but he 
sounds like he won't take this 
deteriorating situation lY:inf down. 

Let's not be taken in by his 
projected concerned aWtude. The 
recent Triton Times article, 
(March 11, lf17,) does not paint the 
entire picture of the full time 
employees (FTE) crisis projected 
for next year. Indeed, the future 
for UCSD undergradu~te 
education Is far bleaker and 
blacker than one would think. 

In truth, the UCSD ad-
ministration is 10 devoted to flrst-
rate undergraduate education, that 
they have decided to overenroU the 
freshman class next year by 200 
students, thus providing more 
people with the opportunity for 
higher-learning on this campus. 

In order to maintain the current 
WldergraduatetrA ratio of 42:1 
with this increased student body, 
we need 187 FTE, not just the 172 
that the administration proposes. 
Thus, 15 FTE are lacking; this 
means that 180 sections taug~ by 
30 TAs will not be held in many of 
the lower-division classes that 
freshmen attend. Even if there 
weren't a programmed increase in 
the freshman class, uam is still 
seven FTE short of this year's 179. 

As a result of the gap between 
the 187 FTE needed for next year 
and the 172 FTE provided, many 
sections will not meet next fall, and 
those that do will have an In-
creased enrollment of 27, perhaps, 
instead of the average 21 students. 

How unfortunate! 
But then , sections are ex-

pendable, for there's no reason to 
go Wlless an exam is programmed 
within the next week or so. The 
other alternative is for one of the 
sections of the class to be taught by 
the professor himself. He can then 
further elaborate on the explicitly 
detailed lectures he gave earlier in 

f!JJ.$. '6-

the week. 
Oh, did you say that the 

professor's lectures aren't always 
clear? 

The graduate students who are 
TAs are particularly concerned 
with this undermining of quality 
education for the undergraduates 
on this campus. We know that 
sections play a vital role in the 
learning process and we have often 
heard students lament, "fd be lost 
without my section." The prospect 
of increased sectioo size is not 
attractive to either un-
dergraduates nor T As. 

Last year's highly-touted but 
illegal use of work-study money for 
graduate student T A salaries was a 
band-aId solution to a gaping 
wound-like crisis. It covered up the 
situation momentarily until it 
proved too costly. The underlying 
problem still remains. 

The UCSD administration has 
not done all it can for un-
dergraduate education. They knew 
we needed additional FTE from 
the UC administration . Why didn't 
they fight for us and get them? 

The inverted order of priorities 
on this campus - administration is 
favored over education - was 
pointed out in the report prepared 
by the Graduate Student Union in 
September, 1975. 

Why haven't the recom-
mendations of this report been 
considered anti pursued? The FTE 
crisis that this campus faced in 
1975 was not as grim as the present 
situation. Why have learning 
conditions deteriorated to this 
point? 

I am convinced that the money 
for the 15 FTE that would provide 
180 sections with 30 T As for 3,780

believe that there is no need to look

A Correction 
To Bike Shop 
Opinion Letter 

A correction - In my recent 
letter expressing concern over a 
PoSSible bike shop closure, I 
mentioned that " the most vocal of 
the bike shop retailers owns three 
shops within 10 miles of t~e 
university. " 

In truth, the most vocal and 
brash of the anit-coop business 
retailers has been Robin Bassham 
of Bassham's Bike Shop in Pacific 
Beach.

8Wl1frIer 

TIle UCSD traek team made a 
IIrcJa8 showintI at tile Kingsman 
Relays last Saturday In Thousand 
C}IIb, finishing only five points out 
tl tile third place, wblIe displaying 
...... t deal fi depth against the 
WI')' teams they wDI face In the 
DIItrict Champio..aupe In May. 

Perennial powerhouse Cal 
Latheran CoDege awed a great 
deal fi versatility on their home 
track while taking first place 
bomrs. Azusa Pacific, on the 
strength of their very strong 
c:lstance squads, ftnlahed a solid 
second. Clairemont Men's College 
edged out the Tritons for the third 
place trophy. 

The Tritons showed considerable 
strength In the field events and 
sprints, while the distance squad 
showed some early season 
weakness. . 

The sprint team of Kevin Mor-
Ding, Robert Ricassa, Eric Hen-
dricks and Frank Longo accoWlted 
for a good nwnber of the team's 
point total. They picked up the only 
victory of the meet for the Tritons 
In the 880 yard relay. Morning's 
22.6 second leg put the Tritons In 
the lead and anchor man Robert 
Ricassa did not relinquish it. The 
same quartet also picked up a third 
in the 440 yard relay, with a time of 
44.3 

In the field event relays, the pole 
vaulters, led by Dan McGiveny, 
took second in that relay event. 
Morning and Ricassa paced the 
Tritons in a second place finish in 
the long jwnp relay. 

The most impressive showing for 
the Tritons was in the mile relay. 
The team of Kevin Morning, Frank 
Longo, Eric Hendricks and John 
Sabin ran a season 's best time of 
3:32.3. The time was good enough 
for 2nd place as Hendricks ran a 

personal best of 53 seconds In IU 
quarter leg. 

The Tritons travel to Northridge 
for the Nortbridge Relays on 
Saturday. The rubberized tfllCk 
should provide lOme fast times If 
the winds stay at a mOderate level. 

UCSD Trims 
Mira Costa In 
3-Way 'Surtout 

The UCSD Surf Team hosted a 
three-way contest on Sunday, 
March 13th, with am Northridge 
and Mira Costa College. Surfing 
without two of their top per-
fonners, the TrItons still managed 
to raise their season record to (4-2) 
defeating both opponents with the 
final score 183 (UalD) - 140 (Mira 
Costa) -23 (CSUN). 

First place finishers for UCSD 
were Rich Gleaves (In the knee-
board competition), Kim Fulton, 
Eric Hanscom and Clark Quinn. 

The contest scheduled for the 
previous weekend, March 5th, was 
canceled in Santa Barbara due to 
poor surfing conditions. 

UCSD will be seeking to avenge 
their two previous season losses to 
UCSB' and Golden West College in 
a six-way contest in Santa Barbara 
on Saturday, March 16th. Included 
in the competition will be UCSC, 
UCI, and either SOS or USC. 
Competition is scheduled for 7:00 
a.m. at a still-t<rbe-chosen local 
site. .

Look at that man down there on the beach with back towards the ocean, 

the one with the eight-liter sombrero and cannel-candy tan, standing aD 
alone, kind of slouched, but head cocked' back looking up Into the sky, 
motionless. See wbat he's doing? Listen to him, he'D teU you. Go ahead, 
listen. He won't mind. .. 

"Tee bee, tee bee, tee hee Ma Nature. What's the idea fitrylngtoworry 
me with those months and months of quiet calm days? You playful bitch 
you. I thought the Idte season might be canceUed because of the weather 
and we wouldn't get to play together this March. But now you're huffing 
and puffing Uke a money-hungry whore, no fifense, beautiful- and I can't 
keep my American Flyer out of your windy skies. I forgot how good it 
could be, you and me together like this, pushing and pulling, but pushing 
and pulling without contention, just for fWl, remaining In one position 
until things run out of meaning from the point of view, tee bee, tee hee ... 

Oh, I see, he's flying a kite, rig"? 
Motionless. Standing !latue still. Static. 
But the Inertia Is a visual Illusion, just another Invention of perception, 

as much a .hllucination as any assertion of real-1Ife aqullibrlwn. Because 
only a constant flow of transient, Invisible 8lr maintains the apparent 
inactivity, the fixed pose, the stationary string, the kite. And In the mind 
there is an energetic production of" increasing entropy: more thoughts, 
more infonnation, more disorder. 

Which is why kite-flylng, despite public delusions of passivity and 
idleness, is an Incredibly vigorous sport: an external balancing act In-
volving Man, Machine, and Nature; an Internal gymnastics perfonnance 
more demanding tban such acclaimed mental exercises as bridge or 
chess because cerebral creativity is necessary, not just analytic 
regurgitation: and, of course, like all good sports, In every facet of flying 
a kite there Is a preponderence of seH-detennined personal style. 

What better place to discover your World and your SeH than at the end 
of a kite string. 

Over there! Look! Another one. The woman down there standing as still 
as an emJiy wheelchair. Listen closely, you can hear her . .. 

"The game is contemplation, not competition. You are alone and you 
work with, not against Nature. Beeause you really are powerless. 
Completely at Ms. N's mercy. If She doesn't blow you can run run run all 
you want but the minute you tire and stop it's all going to fall to the 
grolind, limp and powerless. You can't play unless She's ready. And try to 
fly your kite up there when She gets blustery, well, She'll rip the friggin ' 
thing into a mess 9f toothpicks, confetti, and dental floss . But times like 
now She gladly welcomes everyone. Her extremes show us our place. We 
exist somewhere in the chaos that lies inside those boundaries . . . " 

And way way down there : too far away to see details , just another 
someone doing it, too. But if we're quiet I think we can hear ... 

" With jUst these few scraps of wood and paper and string combined into 
a hexagonal shape incorporating a stabilizing dihedral I have become a 
part of The Process: arriving solar energy converted into the kinetic 
energy of air masses. How does It aU happen? Start with the variables. 
Energy input, energy reflection, topographic variance, and, the real 
killer, those damn crazy oceans. Then what? General air circulation, 
wind, is primarily detennlned by the Wlequal heating of the atmosphere 
at different latitudes and altitudes and by the effects of the Earth's 
rotation. So it's pressure gradients that matter, countless vectors filling 
up quantified space like whirling pine needles caught up in the confusion 
of a hurricane. But wait! What causes what? Wind vs. pressure 
gradients. Do winds adjust themselves to pressure conditions, or is the 
pressure distribution a result of motion in the air? What comes first? 
Hmm. I think the answer is ... " 

Hey man! How come we don't ever get to hear any of these people finish 
with what they're thinking. Right when things start to get interestlng-
POP!- they' re gone. Let's go back. I think we might be able to learn 
something important. 

Sorry, it can' t be done. 
Ah, come on. Please.

Tritons Fall 
To Stiff Zone 
of Grossmont 

by Dave Coben 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons fell prey to some 
excellent defense and a powerful 
inside game, as they dropped 
Monday afternoon's match with 
Grossmont, 48-34. 

Grossmont had the taller team 
and had little difficulty getting 
inside on the Tritons. The Triton 
offense could not find the answer to 
Grossmont's stiff zone . Good of· 
fensive efforts by Carol Gebhart, 
who displayed fine outside 
shooting, kept the Tritons within 
reach throughout the first half. 
Unfortunately , the Tritons were 
forced to work from the perimeter, 
a situation which would hamper 
any team. Grossmont 's defense d id 
not let anyone inside . 

The boards belonged to 
Grossmont. Their front line hauled 
down about twice as many bounds 
as the Tritons. Their work on the 
offensive boards especially hurt 
the Tritons. 

The Tritons were hurt by fouls 
also. Anne Carrington was taken 
out midway through the first half 
with three fouls. Carrington is a n 
integral part of the Triton inside 
game, which was nullified by her 
absence. 

The Tritons went into the sec ond 
half of the game, down 23-16. They 
drew closer in the second haH, but 
only by two points. At 36·31 they 
were as close as they ever got. But 
they did subdue the Grossmont 
attack. The fans were brought to 
life by center Dani G rady, as she 
blocked five shots in the second 
half. 

This, plus the fact that the 
Tritons' own inside game was 
beginning to click, made it look like 
the Tritons might come back. 
Carrington got open on the inside 
and started to draw fouls. But the 
Tritons missed some prime op-
portunities both under the bas ket 
and .from the foul line, and the 
game slipped away. 

The Tritons put up a good battle 
with the powerful Grossmont ball 
club, but injuries , and perhaps 
their smaller size, kept them from 
staying with the visitors. Carol 
Hawley was forced to depart with 
an ankle injury early in the second 
half. Tne Tritons had their ~hare of 
the bad luck. With a healthy ball 
club, they probably could have 
won. 

T here are more than three seconds in this key .

Leary claimed that

MeIqorabilia II 
by 'AlaQ Russell 

I think she must have plotted her revenge the entire quarter. I couldn't 
understand why. Imagine her holding a grudge against me for 
calling her a "ball~utting maenad with delusions of grandeur" in front of 
a lecture hall of 300 people in our Gonzo Literature 135 cta • . 

And now, it was the DAY OF THE FINAL. And she was sitting in front 
of me. And she wasn't wearing a bra, And she had on a shirt(?) more holy 
than the Bible. 

~!!!!!!!!!! 
I really was going to move. My intentions were pure and good. Really. 

But then my intentions had been pure and good for the last two and a half 
hour!; 

I struggled to g~ a hold on myself. Once again I looked at the final 
exam question : "Contrast English Romanticism of the 1800's with 
German Beer Hall Polka songs of the 1930's emphasizing the self in 
relation to the whole while embodying the theme of love and the sexes and 
comradely love in relation to the mores of England with those of Ger-
many." 

I listened to the scratchings of pen on paper all around me. I looked at 
my watch. Twenty five minutes left. Then I looked at my paper. It was a 
beginning which would not make the blue book hall of fame. 

"Oom pah Ooom Pah Ooom pah pah, 
Ooom pah Doom pah Doom pah pah, 

Ach~u lieber Augustine ....... " 
1 looked back at, uh, her. I tried to write some more, but the pen kept 

slipping from my hand, Then my reprieve from the governor came. She 
carried her, uh, bluebooks up to the prof. Half the hearts in the class 
stopped beating while she walked out. 

Then the reality hit me. Twenty minutes left to write out my life on a 
crumby little bluebook. Forty percent of my grade. I did what any red-
blooded American would have done in my shoes. 

I panicked. 
I began to write at the speed of light. Unfortunately, my thoughts 

were somewhere in Central Time. Gradually, I calmed down, both in 
relation to my thoughts and to she who had departed. 

It was at five minutes to ten when my mind began functioning 
reasonably and effectively, my burning insights on the subject matter 
threatening to make flames of the paper. All around me people were 
getting up to turn their blue books in. I worked furiously. 

At ten o'clock the prof stood up and said in a squeaky voice, " I think 
the time is up, class." Most people acquiesced. I worked on. 

At 10:05 the prof spoke to the scattered few remaining in the large 
lecture hall. " Now really, people, it's past time that these examinations 
were turned in." Everybody began to rise-everybody but me. 

At 10:10 the prof approached me. " I must insist on having your paper," 
he said. I pushed him away and continued to burn ink. . 

The prot was troubled. He walked down to his desk in front of the 
lecture hall and sat there-14 rows away from me. Bluebooks, piled high 
on the surface , shielded his face from mine. I continued to write: 

At 10:25 I heard him cackling. I ignored the noises, writing furiously as 
the last sparks of my vision faded away. As 1 scrawled the last sentence I 
knew I had done the impossible-in forty five minutes I had done a bang 
up job on a three hour final. 

Take that, watermelon chest. 
1 walked down the stairs of the long aisle. My footsteps resounded 

behind me, echoing off the empty walls. r approached the prof with my 
bluebooks. He laughed. 

"Do you know what time it is?" he asked. "Do you know that I've 
waited thirty minutes for your final? Do you know that 1 missed
