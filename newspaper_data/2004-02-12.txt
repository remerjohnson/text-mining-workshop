Police warn students of Council reaffirms runoff voting 
Gallagher's Feb. 6 veto overturned le~d conduct suspect 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD Police received three 
reports on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10 of 
lewd conduct iii which four female 
students were approached by a 
'light-skinned Hispanic man saying 
that he was studying "foot reflexolo-
gy" and he needed to study their 
feet. The perpetrator would then 
rub himself in the groin area with 
the victims' feet. 

According to detective 
Nathaniel Floyd, the victims 
described the perpetrator to be five-
feet-eight-inches tall, have a light 
complexion, medium build, short 
brown hair and brown eyes. The 
perpetrator was also described to be 
of college age, or approximately 18 
years or older. According to Floyd, 
the man was last seen wearing blue 
denim pants, a light-blue shirt and a 
white checkered hat. 

"The physical description is pret-
ty consistent in all the reports," 
Floyd said. "At this point we have a 
pretty good description, and we 
want to get the word out to anyone

A~S. passes 
legislation by 
20-0-3 vote 
By MARNETTE FEDERIS 

Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Council overwhelm-
ingly passed a constitutional 
amendment that will change the 
commissioner of academic affairs 
position to vice president of acade-
mic affairs by a vote of 20-0-3 dur-
ing its Feb. II meeting. 

According to Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs Todd Tolin, who 
submitted the legislation, the 
changes will expand the position. 

"I'm extremely happy that this ' 
legislation passed," Tolin said. "I feel 
that this is a big step for academics. 
The legislation gives [the position] 
probably the same attention that it 
needs in telling both the administra-
tion and students that it's a priority 
for students here in campus." 

The legislation amends parts of 
the A.S. Constitution, giving the

The A.S. Council reaffirmed 
legislation to implement single 
runoff voting at their Feb. 11 
meeting following a successful bid 
to overturn a presidential veto of 
single runoff legislation. 

A.S. President Jeremy Paul 
Gallagher vetoed the legislation on 
Feb. 6 because of concerns that 
voter turnout might be drastically 
reduced by the new voting system. 
However, the council overturned 
the veto with a final vote of 15 -6-\. 

Under the single runoff sys-
tem, a general election will be held 
from Monday through 
Wednesday during the second 
week of spring quarter. If a candi-
date fails to win a majority of the 
vote, then a runoff eleaion 
between the two top candidates 
will be held on Thursday and 
Friday. 

"I vetoed the rapid runoff elec-
tions because 1 didn't think they 
we're in the best interest of the 
student body," Gallagher said. 

Student Regent gives 
insight into position 

By BRYAN BAO 
Associate News Editor 

UC Student Regent Matt 
Murray and UC Student Regent-
designate Jodi Anderson held a 
Town Hall meeting on Feb. 9 to 
encourage UCSD students to 
apply for the 2005-06 UC student 
regent position and respond to 
questions about the position. UC 
student regents serve two-year 
terms on the UC Board of 
Regents, serving one year as the 
non-voting student regent-desig-
nate followed by one year as a full 

voting member of the Board of 
Regents. The student regent 
receives either a fee waiver or 
scholarship equal to his or her 
mandatory tuition for the two-
year term, a furnished office on 
his or her campus and would be 
reimbursed for any travel expens-
es incurred while traveling to 
regents meetings. 

"One of the reasons that Jodi 
and I are here is to encourage 
folks like you all to apply to be the

RecrultlnJ: Student Regent Matt Murray (right) shares his experience as a 
voting member of the UC Board of Regents at a Town Hall meeting on Feb. 9. 

"My primary concern was the pos-
sibility of a huge lack of voter 
turnout." 

Some senators expressed that 
the runoff system is the fairest 
choice of election method. 

"It's easy for us to cheat on our 
exams, it's easy for us to steal 
candy from children. That doesn't 
mean we should do it," Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Junior Senator 
Carol Freire said. "I think the 
right thing to do is to go with the 
[runoff] system." 

Debate on the council floor 
was complicated by a separate 
item of immediate consideration 
to change the election method 
back to a simple plurality system. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator and Senate Chair 
Sierra Catco'tt submitted the plu-
rality legislation. 

"People don't want to vote 
twice," Catcott said. "I think it's as 
simple as that." 

Two camps quickly developed 
on the council. Supporters of reg-
ular instant runoff, which 
StudentLink programmers have 

said will not be feasible to imple-
ment in time for this year's elec-
tions, and supporters of plurality 
voting, which has been used in 
past elections, were almost equal 
in number. 

"I think having [students) come 
out once or t\vice is okay," Chair 
of Student Council at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College David 
Goodwin said . "You still have the 
right to go and vote." 

Gallagher argued that voter 
turnout is directly tied to the 
number of candidates running in 
an election. Because the runoff 
elections would have either two or 
zero candidates per office, 
Gallagher predicted that voter 
turnout during the runoff will be 
low. 

While remaining neutral on the 
election method, \lice President 
Finance Eric Webster told the 
council that having a three-day 
period to pass a fee referendum is 
not enough time to get the required 
minimum number of votes.

Police report shows 
bicycle theft on the rise 

By MARGRET GONZALES 
Staff Writer 

Bicycle theft rose 120 percent 
last year, while vehicle theft 
remained steady and auto burglary 
decreased compared to 2002, 
according to a report released by 
the Crime Prevention Unit of the 
UCSD Police. 

"We release these annual statis-
tics because auto theft, auto bur-
glary and bike theft are the most 
commonly asked-about issues by 
students, staff, faculty and parents, 
second to attack and rape con-
cerns," Officer AJ Jenkins said. 

The Crime Prevention Unit 
uses the statistics to check what 
strategies they can employ in 
those specific areas.

Lawrence Berkeley Lab 
head steps down 

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
Director Charles V. Shank announced his decI-
sion Feb. 9 to step down from his position by 
the end of the year. He will retum to UC 
Berkeley as a tenured professor in the depart-
ments of physics, chemistry and computer sci-
ence. 

UC President Robert C. Dynes released a 
statement praising Shank for his 15 years of 
leadership at the laboratory. 

Shank's announcement comes as the 
Department of Energy moves toward competi-
tion for the management of the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Lab, which has been man-
aged by the University of Califomia since its 
inception in 1931. Lawrence Livermore and 
Los Alamos laboratories will also come up for 
bid. 

Dynes stated that if the UC Regents decide to 
partiapate in the competition, Shank will play a 
role in the cJmpetitive process. Dynes has also 
launched a nationwide search for a new labora-
tory diredor. 

Shank, a UC Berkeley graduate, joined the 
Berkeley lab in 1989. Under his stewardship, 
the multi-program research laboratory's bud-
get has increased from $229 million to $500 
million and garnered a workforce of about 
4,000.

Bikes: Theft increased 120 percent 
continued from page I 

percent, targeting mostly Honda makes, 
according to Jenkins. Forty-four cars were 
stolen last year. The most targeted theft 
locations were Lot 702, Miramar Street and 
the Gilman Parking Structure. 

"We spent more time and effort in mon-
itoring the parking lots than any o ther year," 
Jenkins said. "There is a separate depart-
ment that supervises the transportation and 
parking, and we pooled our resources in a 
concerted effort to work together, which 
we'll continue to do this year." 

According to the report, 121 bikes were 
stolen in 2003, a major increase compared to 
the 55 bikes stolen in 2002 . 

"The bike thefts increased dramatically, 
and that sort of crime is so much more diffi-
cult to combat because the thefts occur all 
around campus," Jenkins said. "Auto theft 
and auto burglary are easier to observe 
because they occur in usually the same lots." 

According to Jenkins, a vast majority of 

the bikes were stolen because they were 
insufficiently secured, Jenkins said. They 
were not locked to the bicycle racks correct-
ly, secured with an easily cut chain or wire, 
or not locked at all, he said. 

"If you have a bike, secure it," Jenkins 
said. "Even if it is not thar expensive - if 
you can't afford to buy a new bike, you 
should afford to provide sufficient security. 
A 52 padlock and sma ll cable is next to noth-
ing in providing security." 

According to Jenkins, more students seem 
to have bikes on campus dlis year than last. 

"We do what we can in making sure if the 
bike is registered and secure, but tlle respon-
sibility lies with the students," Jenkins said. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman 
Hubert Luu said he locks his bike with a 
Kryptonite V-lock where he can keep an eye 
on it.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the University of california at San Diego. 
Contents (c) 2004. Views ewpressed herein rept'esent the majority vote of the editorial board 

and are not necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents. the ASUCSD or the members of the 
Guardian staff. 

A.S. Council must clarify 
. elections procedures 
I t's .that time of year agam. Time to pore over 

the A.S. election 6ylaws and 
fix last year's mistakes. 

After a back-and-forth 
battle that spanned an entire 
week, some significant 
changes to the bylaws were 
finally agreed upon. 

One provision makes the 
necessary distinction that it's 
illegal to violate the decisions 
of the A.S. Elections 
Committee. Last year, an 
entire slate was disqualified 
not for violating a specific 
bylaw, but for defying the 
committee's will that the 
slate halt its campaigning. 
Prior to the recent clarifica-
tion, ignoring the commit-
tee's decision wasn't explicitly 
punishable under the ny-laws. 

Another change rIghtly 
clarifies the Dan on classroom 

campai~ing to apply only to 
"actJve classroom cam-
paigning. The council should 
go even further, banning 
only active campaigning that 
disrupts the lecture. 

Another part of the bill 
redefines how candidates can 
be punished for their sup-
porters' activities. The new 

bylaws' definition of a candi-
date's "agent" is overly broad, 
covering anyone "acting on 
behalf' of a candidate or 
shite, and removes a clause 
that would have required 
such official agents to regis-
ter with the A.S. secretary. 
Without requiring agents to 
register, any anonymous sup-
porter - or saboteur -
could don a slate's shirt and 
intentionally disrupt a class-
room, allowing opposition 
forces an opporturuty to dis-
qualify the entire group. 
This bylaw should be 

re~aled . 
Finally, the revised bylaws 

include a compromise 
between the instant runoff 
and plurality voting systems 
- the single runoff voting 
system. Because StudentLink 
is opposed to implementing 
instant runoff votin~ due to 
technical incapabilities, a sin-
gle runoff system is an 
acceptable compromise. 
However, the change will 
require the AS. Council to 
make a concerted effort to 
educate the voters about the 
new system's logistical impli-
cations - like possibly vot-
ing twice. 

Strategies for keeping 
freshman parking 

T he Transportation and Parking Commission 
wisely decided on Jan. 

27 to retain freshman parking 
for 2004-05. The TPC 
deferred any final decision 
until fall 2005, so it has over 
a year to examine the issue. 
The TPC should explore 
alternatives other than sim-
ply deciding on full parking 
rights or altogether elimina-
tion. 

The freshman parking 
issue has gray areas and 
many possible solutions. 
The TPC should expand 
the term "freshm~n park-
ing" to include all on-cam-
pus residents; the concern is 
not the al5e of the driver, but 
the parktng space occupied 
by a car whose driver lives 
on campus. On-campus res-
idents must have parking 
privileges, but the TCP 
should recommend restric-
tions in order to make con-
venient parking available for 
commuter students. 

Most students drive to 
campus every day, laboring 
to find a parking spot -
usually on the outsKirts of 
campus. Closer spots, such 
as the John Muir and Earl 
Warren College lots and 
Pangea and GIlman struc-
tures, are full of cars owned 
by on-campus residents who 
may not u.se them daily. ' . 

To retam on-campus resI-
dent parking, the TCP needs 
to consider designating spe-
cific lots for those living on 
campus. These could be 
located on the edges of cam-
pus - like Regents Lot -
freeing parking spaces closer 
to the center of UCSD for 
commuters. To accommo-
date on-campus residents 
whose cars are parked further 
away: the shuttle system 
should operate on the week-
ends, even if in limited form. 
As a last resort, a lottery sys-
tem could assign parking 
pennits to on-campus resi-
dents.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Solutions to racial 

problems necessary 
Editor: 

In "Ethnic Graduations aTe a 
Fonn of Free Expression" (Feb. 9), 
Logan Goh avoids addressing 
racial problems and proposing 
solutions in favor of a simplistic, 
laissez-faire view of the world that 
does not amount to anything 
resembling a constructive criticism. 

While Goh tried to sound 
righteously nonpartisan and 
objective, he failed. Equating eth-
nic grad\!ations to an element of 
unpleasant but necessary free 
speech is a cop-out to political 
correCOless rather than an analysis 
and acknowledgement of what is 
really going on. 

It is . not in question-that the 
United States has a deplorable 
history when it comes to racial 
division, bllt using ethnic grad 
ceremonies as an attempt to 
make up for historic injustice is a 
farce. 

While a great deal is made 
out of ensuring that minority 
students feel comfortable at all 
campus events, anytime a white 
or nontraditional minority stu-
dent feels uncomfortable, he is 
accused of being prejudiced and 

others are certainly minorities at 
UCSD, too. What's more, the 
majority of UC students don't 

" College graduation is an 
academic, not ethnic, 

celebration." 
is told to cope. As Kelly Gilbert . - Adam PelrImIn, Former lJO.A 
pointed out in her Feb. 9 article, USACmember 
"Distinct ceremonies divide the 
student body," any sort of a 
Caucasi.an grad ceremony would 
not be recognized, even in the 
name of free speech, although 
Slavs, Poles, Croats, Serbs and 

even know what differentiates 
these ethnicities from eac~ 
other. 

College graduation is an aca-
demic, not ethnic, celebration. 

It is about what you have 
achieved, not what color you 
were born. And still, those who 
fight the hardest for spending 
student fees on segregated grad-
uation ceremonies also cry the 
loudest whenever there is a fee 
increase. 

If we continue to systemati-
cally divide by race, we will 
never all "just get along." What 
Goh ignores is that his argument 
has no end. By saying, "We don 't 
like it, but we shouldn'f change 
it," he poses no solution to the 
greater problem of division and 
complacency. If anything, he 
embodies that problem.

Restoring integrity to 
the A.S. elections 

Gallagher's veto defended 
process from political attack 

By DANIEL WAT1S 
Opinion Editor 

Politicians lie all the time. Bill 
Clinton lied about his sex life. 
Richard Nixon lied about 
Watergate. 

Sometimes politicians don't 
"lie,~ per se, but rather "mislead" 
the voters. 

In UCSD's 2003 A.S. elections, 
two candidates - both named 
Kevin Hsu - ran for office under 
the same name.

unintentional deception - is cer-
tainly within their rights as 
American citizens. 

But on Feb. 4, the A.S. Council 
passed a bill submitted by A.S. 
Commissioner of Communications 
Frances Galvon to create new 
election bylaws that would have 
banned "mislead[ing) voters on 
candidate statements, expression 
statements, or materials." In a rare 
instance of an A.S. president actu-
ally exercising his powers, Jeremy 

Paul Gallagher 
One ran on a 
poli tical slate 
named Students 
First! and had 
been Warren 
College'S sopho-
more senator and 
the A.S. Vice 
President 
Internal. The 
other was the 

It's all shady activity 
... but deception -
even unintentional 

vetoed the bill, sav-
ing ASUCSD from 
the embarrassment 
of trying to uncon-
stitutionally restrict 
candidates' free-
dom of speech. 

Every candidate 
misleads voters in 
some way. Kevin 
Hsu's very exis-
tence on the ballot 
could have been 
considered an 
attempt to mislead 
voters, and there-

"A.S. VP 
Internal" and 

. "Warren sopho-
more senator" of a 
student organiza-
tion named 

deception - is 
certainly within their 
rights as American 

Students First! People's Parking 
Party presidential candidate Bryan 
Barton ran on a pro-parking plat-
form, promising to fire "as many 
meter maids as -possible." Every 
candidate promised more "S" 
spots. 

These are examples of candi-
dates misleading voters. It's all 
shady activity, and somewhat dis-
honest, but deception - even 

fore grounds for 
disqualification under the pro-
posed rule. Banon misled voters 
by promising to fire meter maids 
- an undeliverable campaign 
promise. If he were disqualified 
because of that, the elections 
committee would be punishing 
him for his ignorance rather than 
any concerted attempt to mislead

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Coping with budget setbacks 
Professor sheds light on UCSD's strategies 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

T he past month has borne witness to a series of pro-posals by the newly-mint-
ed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
to impose some measure of fiscal 
austerity at the Univenity of 
California in the midst of the 
state's budget crisis . Included are 
a 10 percent hike in tuition for 
in-state undergraduates and 
more drastic tuition increases for 
out-of-state, graduate and pro-
fessional students, along with a 
reduction of money redirected to 
financial aid from fee increases, 
from 33 percent to 20 percent. 
On Feb: 2, this writer sat down 
with Dr. Michael Parrish, a 
UCSD history professor of over 
30 years, who is directly involved 
with faculty consultations on 
how the university should cope 
with budget cutbacks. Below are 
some excerpts from the conver-
sation: 

Horse: Has [a fee increase) 
restricted access in the past? I 
mean, you can always take out 
years and years of loans. Have 
students . demonstrated that 
they're willing to do this for a 
UC education? 

Parrish: My sense is that in the 
last few years, the financial aid con-
tribution has contributed roughly 
48 to 52 percent of the cost. The 
rest is the responsibility of the stu-
dent and the parents. That's going 

to change for this year - in other 
words, the student and parent con-
tribution will have to be more, 
because the financial aid contribu-
tion will be cut in a significant way. 
We no longer have a public univer-
sity in a sense of a comminnent by 
the legislature and the governor ... 

The essentials of the partner-
ship was that it was promised by 
the governor that every year, the 
university would receive enough 
dollars to educate the new students 
who would come. The basic agree-
ment was that for every new stu-
dent, the university would get 
58,500 - that is the marginal cost 
of educating a student. It doesn't

public university in a 

sense of a commitment 
by the legislature and the 

governor ... "

ptVfessor 

really cover the whole cost; it does-
n't really cover things like dining 
hall facilities, computer labs, etc .. .. 
Whatever the governor does, the 
legislature is not committed to giv-
ing the university even any new 
money for the new students. Thats 
why the Regents basic3.Jly said, 
"we're going to cut enrollment -
we're not going to take maybe 
3,200 students who are eligible, 
and who should be here next year, 
but we can't educate them because 

we're not getting any money from 
the legislature for these new stu-
dents." 

H: And the university bas 
already made capital invest -
ments? 

P: No, the capital side is OK -
the state has provided capital funds 
for buildings. That's fine - the 
problem is the operating side. The 
state provided money for the new 
campus at Merced, and the various 
bond issues have been passed in the 
last five to six years. It's not the cap-
ital budget that's hurting, it's things 
like operations, maintenance on 
the buildings we already have -
there's no money there for that ' 
The point is that the State of 
California has failed to keep the 
promises made in the partnership 
. .. What this means is that right 
now, faculty salaries in the universi-
ty at all levels, from full professors 
to assistant professors, UC salaries 
are seven to nine percent behind 
our competition, our comparison 
universities ." If you're trying to 
hire the best young professor in 
engineering or history or biology, 
the University of California cannot 
match the salaty that person will be 
offered at Duke or Stanford, or 
even public schools like Michigan. 
We're at a competitive disadvan-
tage at getting good researchers 
and good scholars. 

H: Another big patt of the cut 
has been to the Institute for 
Labor Relations. Is that worry-
ing, that this might be a targeted 
political cut? 

P: The problem here is that 
between 1995 and 2000, when the 
state had a lot of mpney coming in

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THl,JRSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2004 

V~to: Candidates can start campaigning early 
continued from page 5 

bylaws didn't allow for even unin-
tentional deception. All that 
would be needed to prove a candi-
date "violated" the bylaw is a voter 
walKing into the election commit-
tee and saying, "I was misled." 

A telltale sign of things to come, 
the vetoed bill also contained a 
one-sentence addition to the "cam-
paign period" section. The addition 
read simply, "Campaigning is 
allowed only within the campaign 
period." 

The fact that the senate 
thought it necessary to add this 
clause to the existing bylaws proves 
that there was no existing punish-
ment for campaigning outSide of 
the campaign period. Since the 
addition was vetoed, the existing 
rules stand. Candidates can cam-
paign outside of the campaign 
period - and rightfully so, 
because preventing candidates 
from telling others of their poten-
tial candidacy is an unconstirution-
al restriction of their freedom of 
speech. For years, careless candi-
dates falsely assumed that talKing 
about running for office was some-
how confined to the limitS of a 
two-week period in March. The 
senate's bill, and Gallagher'S prin-
cipled veto. proves otherwise. 

The bill conwned other signs 
that show a disrurbing attempt to 
buttress the power of slate politics. 
One section of the bill destroyed the 
current limit of 150 words for candi-
date statementS. No information was 
to appear on the ballot other than a 
name and whether the candidate 
accepted campaign spending limits. 
Later, the bill was amended to limit 
candidate "expression statementS" to 
40 characters - about half as long as 
this sentence. The current sta tement 

lengths were put into place after the 
200 1 elections, in respon'ie to a suit 
filed against then-elections manager 
Vmcc Vasquez by Matthew Bechtel, 
who ran as an independent for A.S. 
commissioner of programming. The 
suit charged that the 2001 system 
was unfair: Only a candidate's slate 
affiliation could appear next to his 
name, which discriminated against 
candidates without a slate. The A.S. 
Council agreed, and amended the 
elections bylaws to remove slate 
afliliations and add the candidate 
statement. This helped level the 

" The bill coniained other 
signs that show a disturbing 

attempt to buttress the 
power of slate politics. " 

playing field for independent candi-
dates by giving them an equal chan!=e 
to publicize their campaigns on the 
ballot - albeit i,n only 150 words. 
Galvons bill would have obliterated 
this, giving slates and srudent politi-
cal parties a huge advantage. Slates 
distribute thousands of copies of 
their own campaign literarure, each 
of which listS the names of their slat-
ed candidates. Without the baUot 
statementS, underfunded indepen-
dent candidates cannot compete. 

Another amendment would 
have narrowed the definition of the 
ban on "campaign[ing) in class-
rooms" to read "actively 
campaign(ing) in classrooms." Last 
year, Jonathan Abeye, Students 
Fi rst !'s candidate for Thurgood 
Marshall College senior senator, 

was disqualified for draping a t-
shirt bearing the Students First! 
logo over the baCk of a chair in a 
Peterson Hall classroom. This is as 
"inactive" as campaigning getS. and 
yet he was disqualified - setting a 
precedent that helped to disqualify 
his entire slate. • 

Galvon's bill smacks of slate 
politics. Her Students First! slate 
faltered last year, losing many col-
lege-level senate races to indepen-
dent candidates. Other elections 
were closer than they should have 
been, given the organizational 
ability of StudentS First! and itS 
history of overwhelming electoral 
success at UCSD. Her bill is an 
attempt to twist the elections 
bylaws to reinvigorate StudentS 
First! by removing anti-slate 
obstacles like the candidate state-
ments. The "misleading voters" 
ban would have disqualified the 
nonslate-affiliated Kevin Hsu. 
Other sections are narrowly tai-
lored toward legalizing offenses 
committed by her fellow slate 
members last year, such as Abeye's 
t-shirt incident. 

Certain aspects of the bill would 
have helped this election. David 
Goodwin, chair of the Srudent 
Council of Eleanor Roosevelt 
College, added an amendment cod-
ifying the widespread assumption 
that it's illegal to defy the will of the 
elections committee. 

Other portions of the bill did 
pass, escaping Gallagher's veto. 
The enacted portions were largely 
benign procedural clarifications 
and did not substantially change 
the elections process. Gallagher let 
them through, and rightfully con-
demned a politicized attempt to 
solidify the power of slate p~liti cs. 
That's an honest politician. 

Lette'rs: Death threats, raci.al slurs prevail 
conrinued from page 4 

race-based groups were unfair and 
those of European descent should be 
able to have their groups too. 1 even 
argued with my parentS that every-
thing was perfecdy fine with my first 
boyfriend being "white." 

Unfortunately, that's where the 
similarities end. 

I have found that unlike many 
people from UCSD ("whites" and 
"colored" included), I have been 
made very aware of the fact that 1 
have more melanin in my sKin and 
different features on my face early 
on. In elementary, I was aSked if my 
face was smashed by an iron. In high 
school, I was made aware that my 
group of friends was all whi te except 
for me. Racist phone calls, death 
threats, racial slurs like "chink," 
"railroad worker," "potSticker lady," 
etc. were thrown at me. Mind you, I 
come from the Silicon Valley 
(stereotyped "the Asian mecca"). 
Just over winter break, I came back 
from China and had an English 
woman screech at me and the other 
Asians that just got off the plane to 
get out of the citizen line and into 
the foreigner line just b::cause we 
weren't "white." Interesting how 
that's the first thing you are greeted 
by after you step off the plane and 
read the "Welcome to America" 
sign. 

Taylor complains that the class-
es in UCSD lead to self-loathing 
for being white. Isn't it lucky that 
he's never before had to experience 
any of the aforementioned in real 
life directed specifically at him? 1 
believe he misinterprets the pur-
pose of those classes. 

For most of our lives, we have 
been taught that America is great 
and beautiful. 

America n "white" men are 
grcat because they fou nded the 
country. Likewisc, so are "whitc" 
European men who gave them 
thci r ideologies. "White" women 
fought for and gained right . 
"Blacks" fought for rights and 
gained freedom . "Natives" are 

vaguely mentioned to have been 
oppressed, but recompensated. 
(Oh yes, but first they had a nice 
Thanksgiving picnic with the 
Pilgrims.) 

Notice the incredible lack of 
other ethnicities and the glorifica-
tion of "whites"? 

One of my friends decided to 
become a high school history 
teacher because his rextbook had 
depicted Filipinos as barbarians who 
were "rescued" by whites. These col-
lege. classes are meant to till in the 
blanks and set history straight. 
There is not a superfluous necessity 

" .. . whoever holds the 
power tends to be held 

accountable for'a society's 
problems. In history, it 
just so happens to be 
white men who are in 

power most of the time." 
-SIe==..warren 

of more "white" glorification. It is 
already programmed into most of us. 

Yes, I understand the feeling 
that it must generate to be told that 
whites were evil in the past. 
However, it is generally true that 
whoever holds the power tends to 
be held accountable for ·a society's 
problems. [n histOry, it just so hap-
pens to be white men who are in 
power most of the time. As for peo-
ple being "white-washed" or 
"selectively dissociating from their 
race," how about an Asian guy in 
my history class telling me that the 
KKK is not so bad. Most of the 
class agreed with him. Mind you, [ 
am by no means saying those are 

the only reasons why he might have 
said that. Various reasons rllight 
explain it such as being one of the 
lucky ones who have never had to 
encounter racism. 

The purpose of the "ethnic" 
clubs are to extend the conceptS of 
the courses. They are meant to give 
people a voice who do not have one. 
They are used to fight against the 
injustices and educate against the 
prejudices - only a few of which I 
have mentioned above. The point 
of the graduation ceremonies are to 
thank people for their hard work 
throughout the years. I. think a very 
big part of Chris Taylor's miscon-
ception is that these clubs are exclu-
sive. By no means are they so. We 
encourage people of all ethnicities 
to join in every activity. Everyone is 
treated as an equal. Do not make 
judgments without experiencing 
and considering as I have done for 
his article. 

As a final thought, I hope you 
have noticed that my reality is 
very different than that of Chris 
Taylor's. I think he is very lucky 
not to have experienced any hate 
crimes or true discrimination (1 
acknowledge that those too hap-
pen to "whites"). 

Moreover, I think it is interest-
ing that he has chosen to attack 
ethnic studies and groups, but not 
those concentrated on the female 
gender (even though one could 
easily make the same argumen~ for 
both). 

Both exist for the same reasons 
and equally suffer discrimination, 
hate, the glass ceiling, blue and 
pink collarism, and all the won-
derful consequences thereo f.~ I 
wish one day that we could all live 
in Chris Taylor's world where 
people truly can be judged solely 
on the quality of their cha-:acter, 
but as of yet, the denial and sup-
press ion of a societal disease is not 
the cure for the social body.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 7 

Horse: UCSD's research money replaces some funds lost from state budget 
continued from page 5 

because the dot-com boom, 
California was recei\~ng. in one year, 
$16 billion in capital gains taxes, as 
well as another couple billion in 
stock options taxes ... and the uni-
versity benefited. Now some of these 
programs, like the labor institute and 
others, were the pet projects of peo-
ple in the legislarure. The labor 
instirute was the pet project of [State 
Senate President Pro Tempore IJ ohn 
Burton (D - San Francisco). There 
was another instirute, the Mind 
instirute, which was the project of 
[State Sen.) John Vasconcellos (D -
San Jose). The university did not ask 
for any of those in its budget 
requests. They were research activi-
ties that the legislamre said, "you 
must do this," so they laid all this 
money on the university thinking it 
was going to be permanent. Of 
course, when the revenues went 
down - this year the state will only 
get $7 billion or less in capital gains 
- the university has lost a huge 
amount in revenue ... Now, if you 
want to operate it, you have to go 
out and raise private capital. 

H : So on the issue of private 
capital, then, is that worrying? 
UCSD is one of the most-funded 
research universities, per faculty 
member, from federal research 
grants. 

P : That helps us to the extent 
that if we didn't have the $1.6 bil-
lion that does come back. For 
every federal contract or grant, a 
certain percentage of that is called 
"overhead money," or the cost to 
the universiry to do research. That 
money comes back to the universi-
ty. and a share of it comes back to 
each campus depending on how 
much it generates. My sense is that 
UCSD is now number one or 
number two in the UC system - I 
think we're ahead of [UC) 
Berkeley. 

H : I think per faculty member 
we're ahead of everyone ... 

P: Yes, that's probably true, but 
in terms of the total amount, we 
might be behind UCLA, although 
I'm not certain. But those do help, 
because those are dollars that sup-
plement what the state provides. If 
it were not for those dollars, we 
would be in deep trouble, because 
some of those monies can go to help 
recruit faculty, or some of it can go 
to reconfiguring laboratories, some 
of it can go into the library. 
Without those soft dollars, we 
would be in a real fue But you can't 
use that money for everything. You 
can't use it to hire faculty, you can't 
use it for TAs, you can't use it, by 
and large, for the instructional pro-
gram. you can only use it, by and 
large, for research. 

H : Do humanities and social 
sciences suffer disproportionately 
from budget cuts because they 
don 't have the kind of federal 
funding engineering and sciences 
can get? 

P : [Engineering, natural sci-
ences and physical sciences) are 
able to operate their deparonents 
without as much dependence on 
state dollars. To that extent, 
[humanities and social sciences) are 
disadvantaged. If those three divi-
sions didn't get this outside money, 
they would have to rely more on 
state funding. Just in terms of 
ern-ollment numbers, they would 
get a bigger share of state dollars. 

When the state gives the cam-
pus money, it is divided up by 
enrollment. If -you've got 3,500 
engineering students and 2.800 

. biology majors, universities have to 
ha\le the money to teach those stu-
dents . The history department has 
500 srudentS, tiny in comparison to 
engineering or biology. If everyone 
was dependent on state money, our 
position would be worse. That's 

not to say it's good. 
H : AIe you feeling the effects 

here at the history deparonent? Is 
there a tangible difference in 
being able to hire faculty or keep 
on postdocs? 

P: We can't offer the best grad-
uate srudents the best financial aid 
that many of the private schools 
can. Even if we have an outstand-
ing candidate who wants to come 
to UCSD to -study history, our 
offer is often $3,000 less than say. 
Stanford or some other private 
school, so we lose the student. 

" [Engineering, natural 
sciences and physical 

sciences} are able 
to operate their 

departments without as 
much dependence on 

state dollars." 
- Dr. Michael PMish, UCSD 

history professor 

H : That affects faculty 
research? 

P: That affectS undergraduate 
education, because at some point 
the graduate srudent becomes a 
teaching assistant. If he's not the 
best teaching assistant compared to 
who you might have had, the 
undergraduates suffer. 

I'll tell you what the big debate 
is right now, what is happening 
right now, which wiJl have a big 
impact. How do you distribute the 
limited financial aid that will come 
back to the university, as a percent-
age of tuition and fees? How do we 

distribute it among the campuses, 
and among graduate and under-
graduate srudentS' This is going to 
be the most brutal and the most 
contentious inside the university, to 
say nothing of our relationship to 
the governor and the legislarure. [n 
the past, there was a sharp wall of 
separation between undergraduate 
financial aid and graduate financial 
aid. University policy was that the 
money that was returned from 
undergraduate fees went exclusive-
ly to undergraduates in terms of 
financial support. and graduate stu-
dent fees went to the graduate sru-
dentS. 

There is now the proposal, I 
think coming from the president'S 
office, that that wall be torn down, 
that there be one pot, and it would 
be distributed according to different 
rules. In effect, some money that 
would have gone to undergraduates 
in the past would be diverted to 
graduate financial aid. As you know, 
the teaching assistants are union-
ized, they're a part of the United 
Autoworkers Union. 

Part of their contract with 
their university requires the uni -
versity to pay their fees . Who's 
going to pay that? Is it a cost of 
instruction? Well, you could say it 
is, because this is an employee 
benefit. But is it also a part of 
graduate financial aid? 

The problem is that it's both. 
There is going to be a bitter battle 
in the university over whether you 
should take a piece of what is 
going to be returned and normal-
ly go to undergraduate aid and use 
that to help pay the contractual 
obligations of the T~. This is 
going to be a knock-down, drag-
out, bloody battle, because in a 
sense you're robbing the under-
graduates to pay the contractual 
obligations of the university. 

But there's another issue here. 

and that is some campuses have 
more TAs than others. In other 
words, the growing campuses like 
San Diego, Irvine, Riverside, and to 
some extent, Santa Barbara, have a 
larger contracrual obligation to pay 
than UCLA or UC Berkeley, or the 
medical school, UCSF. which does-
n't have TAs (UCSF has no under-
graduates). [t's going to be a pretty 
nasty battle - how to maintain 
contractual obligations. How do 
you maintain access for your 
undergraduates who need the 
money, especia lly those who are 
poor? AIe you going to have to take 
money away from needy under-
graduates and reallocate it to grad-
uate students - is that fair? T his is 
going to be brutal. 

H : What do you think the end 
result is going to be? 

P: [ don't know - ask me in 
another month. I'm on a faculty 
committee statewide that is going 
to debate on Feb. 10 and recom-
mend things to the president. The 
president can do whatever he and 
the chancellors decide on, and the 
RegentS . I su~pect there is goi ng to 
be a push to maintain the wall - [ 
suspect there's also going to be a 
push by faculty to say. "look. before 
we begin to raid the financial aid 
POt, let's see if we can look on each 
campus to find other ki nds of 
money that hasn't already been

New UC guidelines restrict student 
govemment campaign financing 
By cAlw FAURE 

News Editor 

Student lobbying groups have 
expressed dissatisfaction over 
some restrictions on student gov-
ernment funding set in the new 
draft of guidelines released by the 
UC Office of the President on 
Feb. 4. 

The new draft prohibits stu-
dent government use of student 
fees in funding "non-universLty 
political campaigns," which 
include ballot initiatives. This 
would disallow such student gov-
ernment action as the contentious 
allocation of $35,000 by the UC 
Berkeley Graduate Student 
Assembly to a" 0 on Prop. 54" 
campaign in fall 2003. 

UCOP is in the process of 
upda.ting the guidelines to comply 
with a 1999 Supreme Court ruling 
ca lling for campus student organi-
zations to be funded on a view-
point-neutral basis. The final ver-
sion is expected be ready by spring 
quarter. In the meantime, student 
governments and administrators 
from each campus have one 
month to give UCOP feedback. 

The UC Student Association 
has also been involved with the 
university in negotiating the new 
draft. 

"We've been involved since the 
beginning to develop a compro-
mise, and it continues to be a com-
promise," UCSA chairman Matt 
Kaczmarek said in response to the 
latest dra ft. 

He said that UCSA was pleased 
with the guidelines' clear defini-
tions of viewpoint neutrality, 
allowing student organizations to 
engage in a wide range of activi-

ties, but disappointed with the 
provisions on student government 
lobbying. 

"It puts unnecessary restric-
tions on student government," 
Kaczamrek said. 

Rob Thompson, an organizer 
at the Boston-based Center for 
Campus Free Speech, echoed the 
complaint. 

" [The university guidelines] 
put unnecessary 

restrictions on student 
government. " 

- Matt Kaaamarek. chair, 
UC Student Association 

"I don't understand why dle 
university is choosing to limit the 
voice of delT)ocra tically elected 
advocates of the students, espe-
cially in California where working 
on ballot initiatives is so impor-
tant," he said. 

Thompson said he feels that the 
draft is inconsistent with the U.S. 
Supreme COUTtS Board of Rtgmts of 
tht University of Wisconsin v. 
Soutlrworth decision, in which it was 
stated that universities are free to 
fund any array of student organiza-
tions with student fees so long as 
the university believes those activi-
ties to be consistent with the educa-
tional mission of the university. 

"They can't say ballot initia-
tives aren't educational, because 
they've said it for years, and have 
allowed student organizations to 

speak on it," Thompson said. 
"They're basically singling out the 
student governments, and in that 
sense, they're viol ating their first 
amendment rights." 

UCOP officials said they will 
not be commenting until the 
guidelines are finalized. 

Another change in the new 
draft raising concerns is a provi-
sion that prohibits students from 
voting in campus referenda to 
allocate funds to specific student 
activities. 

Thompson said the University 
of California is unique in his expe-
rience with universities nation-
wide. 

"I think California has a strong 
fee system simply in that they let 
student organizations get involved 
in a wide variety of issues," he 
said. "But the restrictions on stu-
dent government I haven't 
encountered before." 

A.S. Vice President External 
Harish Nandagopal said he will be 
working on lobbying' the UCSD 
administration and UCOP about 
the issue. 

"UCSD historically hasn't 
been very good about forwarding 
our input to UCOP, so we have to 
make sure that happens this time," 
Nandagopal said. 

Kaczamarek said UCSA plans 
to submi t their own suggestions as 
well as make sure each campus' 
administrators and student gov-
ernment do the same. 

"UCSAi; objective is to build 
some kind of consensus through-
out the system," he said. "I don't 
expect the final dra ft to be very 
different, but there's definitely 
possibility for improvement on 
many points."

UCSD celebrates 
3 million volumes 

By SHANNON EUor 
Staff Writer 

Members of the UCSD commu-
nity gathered to celebrate the acqui-
sition of the three-millionth volume 
by the UCSD Libraries on Feb. 9 at 
the Institute of the Americas. 

Written by John Claridge, "The 
Shepherd of Banbury'S Rules to 
Judge the Changes of the Weather" 
is the three-millionth book to be 
welcomed into the UCSD 
Libraries system. Published in 
London in 1744, it is a small vol-
ume of 64 pages that contains vari-
ous adages about the weather and 
its changes. The volume was donat-
ed by library benefactor Kenneth 
Hill. 

According to University of 
California President Emeritus 
Richard C. Atkinson, Hill also 
donated the rare, first edition of 
Dmitri Mendeleev's "Principles of 
Chemistry," published in 1868 in St. 
Petersburg, Russia. The book con-
tains the first publication of the peri-
odic table of the elements, and was 
the thirty-millionth volume acquired 
by the University of California. 

"We are very excited about 
reaching the three-millionth volume 
mark," said Brian E.C. Schottlander, 
university librarian for UCSD 
Libraries. "This is a significant mile-
stone for us as an institution."

Regent: Murray discusses role on board VP: New title will bring 
accountability, Tolin says conrinued from page I 

student regent," Murray said, 
pointing out that for nearly a 
decade almost all student regents 
have come from UC Berkeley or 
UCLA. "We need student regents 
from somewhere else, and I think 
San Diego is a great place for 
them to be from." 

In order to be eligible, students 
must be in good standing at their 
campus and be enrolled in some 
capacity at the University of 
California for the next two years. 
Applicants must complete an 
application by Feb. 19 that, in 
addition to basic information, 
requires three references and short 
essays. Afrer all applications have 
been submitted, a regional nomi-
nating committee will select 
approximately 18 students for ini-
tial interviews to be held March 6. 
UCSD applications would be 
reviewed by the Northern 
Regional Nominating Committee, 
which consists of eight representa-
tives from UC Berkeley, UC 

Davis, UC San Francisco and UC 
Santa Crur.. From tmt pool of 
interviewees, the regional nomi-
nating commissions will select 
nine semifinalists, who will then be 
interviewed by the Board of 
Directors of the UC Student 
Association in April 2004. UCSA 
will then select three finalists, who 
the Regents' special committee to 
select a student regent will inter-
view in May 2004. The university 
would pay for any travel expenses. 

"The process itself sounds kind 
of long and convoluted ... but it's a 
tremendously valuable learning 
opportunity," Anderson said. "We 
thought 'what are the chances that 
I'm going to be selected' ... but the 
great thing will be that I will learn a 
lot about policymaking that goes on 
at the university and the Board of 
Regents, and I'll at least go away 
from the process having learned 
something valuable." 

Student regents attend the bi-
monthly Regents meetings, held 
on the first Wednesday and 

Thursday of every other month. 
In addition, specific committees of 
the Board of Regents hold meet-
ings during the months without 
full board meetings. 

"[The position is) completely a 
self-motivated thing," Murray 
said. "The type of issues that you 
work on is pretty much at your 
diScretion ... To me, it's a full-time 
job, and I take a reduced course 
load of two or three courses a 
semester." 

According to Anderson, taking 
the position validates all the extra 
work of having to attend Regents 
meetings and serving as a repre-
sentative of the school. 

"For me, it's worth the trade-
off because it's a pretty tremen-
dous opportunity," Anderson said. 
"I've been to every UC campus 
and not only been to the campus, 
but got to meet with students, 
staff, faculty, administrators and 
chancellors at many campuses. So 
the opportunitY to learn was the 
trade-off for me."

position the power to advise the A.S. 
president and the council "on all 
academic matters" and the power to 
appoint student representatives, 
with council approval, to cam-
puswide committees. According to 
Tolin, the changes give the 
Associated Students a more official 
voice in the Academic Senate. 

"The legislation clarifies the 
position," Tolin said. "The position 
itself has been doing duties that 
constitute a vice presidency for 
some time." 

According to Tolin, there is a 
possibility that the position could 
have its own legislative committee 
similar to the other vice president 
positions in the council. 

While the legislation passed 
overwhelmingly, with only a few 
abstentions, some councilmembers 
have some expressed concerns 
about whether the changes would 
truly expand the office. 

includes duties that differ from the 
other commissioner positions. 

"'Commissioner' has given a false 
impression of the amount of work 
that the office really does," Tolin 
said. "The office does two things -
its a job and at the same time it rep-
resents students regularly to the 
Academic Senate, faculty, adminis-
tration, and regularly speaks on 
behalf of these students." 

Council members at the senate 
meeting agreed that because the 
office services a specific constituen-
cy, the position needs to have 
greater accountability. 

"I think that the office needs 
accountability," Tolin said. "This 
[office] is really the only voice that 
they have on the academic side." 

Other councilmembers agreed, 
that academic affairs need to receive 
more priority from the A.S. Council. 

Police: Four persons report lewd conduct 
"I'm in favor for (the legislation), 

but I had some concerns about it," 
Thurgood Marshall College 
Freshman Senator Alan Haimowitz 
said. "I don't know if we're actually 
going to extend academic affairs. 1 
want to know that A.S. is actually 
saying that we want academic affairs 
to be a vice presidency and not just 
because Todd has done such a great 
job. I actually want it to happen." 

"Why shouldn't we prioritize 
academics, because really, when 
you strip it all down, that's what 
we're for anyway?" Marshall 
Sophomore Senator Kat Pillon said 

For some council members, the 
new tide for the position is impor-
tant in working with administrators.

p.m. in which the perpetrator 
approached twO individuals. The 
second incident occurred on Feb. 
10 at 2 p.m. at Lot 705. A -third 
occurrence took place on the same 
day at 4 p.m. at Galbraith Hall . . 

"The victims were in fairly 
crowded areas," Floyd said. "They 
don't appear to be ~Ione during the 
contact. There are other people 
around in the general area." 

According to Crime 
Prevention Officer Alan Jenkins, 
it is also uncertain whether the 
perpetrator is a UCSD student. 

"I think that it seems so blatant 
that he's trying to get across as a 
student, but he's probably not a 
student," Jenkins said. 

Both Jenkins and Floyd are 
encouraging students to be aware 
of the incidents and to contact the 
police if they have further infor-
mation. According to Jenkins, the 
perpetrator would engage the vic-
tims in small talk and does not 
immediately appear threatening. 
According to Officer Kristeen 
McCollough, students should pay 
attention to their sUTtoWldings. 

"I think if they were fore-
warned about it, they would not 
have let it go as far as it did," 

McCoulough said. "He obviously 
approaches the victims in such a 
way that is very convincing." 

McCollough also said that 
there could have been other inci-
dents in the past two days that 
have gone unrepC!rted. 

"These are one of those things 
that people get embarrassed about, 
and they don't report it," 
McCollough said. "And maybe 
now that they hear that it hap-
pened to other people, we may end 
up getting more calls about it." 

Students with information or 
who would like to repon a similar 
incident are encouraged to call 
campus police at (858) 534-4357. 

The legislation must be approved 
by at least four out of six college 
councils before it is officially imple-
mented. If approved by the college 
councils, the changes will be effec-
tive in time for this years elections. 

Council members discussed the 
changes in more depth during a 
senate meeting preceding the 
council meeting. During the senate 
meeting, Tolin said that the com-
missioner of academic affairs office

Vote: Elections will be held 
with single runoff voting 

Books: Library reaches 3 million mark 
continued from page I 

"I'm not planning on writing a 
fee referendum under the runoff 
scenario," Webster said. "It's not 
worth it trying to push something 
that doesn't stand a chance." 

Another aspect of the debate 
centered on college council elec-
tions, which usually coincide with 
A.S. elections. 

With the exception of the 
Student Counci l of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, no college 
counci ls have decided to change 
their elections bylaws to accommo-
date runoff voting. 

"It is irresponsible and lacking 
foresight of the council to pass a 
voting system knowing that the 
college councils are going to have 
to scramble to either change or 
adopt or adapt to somethi ng that 
wi.1I go along with A.S.," Marshall 
Sophomore Senator Kate Pillon 
said. "The college councils have 
neither the time ... nor the money 
to run their own elections." 

After thirty minutes of debate, 
the council originally fai led to reach 
the two-thirds majority required to 
overrurn the veto with a vote of 11-
11-1. A motion to reconsider the 
item ended in the exact same vote. 

The council also failed the plu-
rality legislation, which only 
required a majority, with a vote of 
9- 11 - 1. The council voted to 
reconsider the iterri, but failed it 
again with a vote of 10-12-0. 

Because the presidential veto of 
the si ngle runoff system included 
key parts of the election bylaws and 
because the council failed to adopt 
the plurality legislation, the elec-
tions bylaws were left in a tempo-
rary state of disarray. At one point, 
Gallagher told the council that if 
nothing was adopted, there would 
be no A.S. election. 

The council then suspended a 
bylaw which prohibits reconsider-
ing an item more than once so that 
they could vote on the elections 
legislation again. 

For the third time, the council 
failed to reach the required mini-
mum to overturn Gallagher's veto 
with a vote of I3 -9-1. 

Following more debate, the 
council also failed to pass the plural-
ity legislation with a vote of9-12-1. 

Apparently at an impasse, 
Catcott announced that she would 
change her vote to allow the veto to 
be overturned so that viable elec-
tions bylaws could be produced. 
Catcott was joined by other sena-
tors who reluctantly "greed to sup-
port the veto overturn for the sake 
of having an election. 

"We're going to be the bigger 
people here and do what's best for 
students, but I'm not happy," 
Catcott said. 

Pillon, another staunch sup-
porter of a plurality voting system, 
also decided to change her vote. 

"I want to make it clear that I'm 
not changing my opinion," Pillon 
said. "But as I've stated, I always try 
to act in the best interest of the stu-
dents. It's better to have an election 
system than no system at all." 

Upon the fourth consideration 
of the item, the required two-thirds 
majority to overturn the veto was 
met and the si ngle runoff system 
was left intact. 

The deadline for the final deci-
sion on the election method was 
the Feb. II A.S. Council meeting, 
according to A.S. Elections 
Manager Tom Chapman. 

The filing period for this year's 
election begins on Feb. 17 . Mer 
that date. changes to the elections 
bylaws will not take effect until the 
following election.

Coast, second only to UCLA. 

Acting Chancellor Marsha A. 
Chandler said she felt UCSD was 
making rapid progress in estab-
lishing a reputable collection. 

"The acquisition of the three-
millionth volume is very' much a 
coming-of-age for the library," 
Chandler said. "There are only 
fifty libraries in the U.S. that have 
three million volumes ... but 
more importantly, we're the only 
university established post-World 
War n that fits into this category, 
so it's not JUSt a coming-of-age. 
but a coming-of-age in record 
time. I also think it really says 
something about the campus 
when we have our library as the 
[university] icon." 

According to Chandler, it was 
John Galbraith, the second chan-
cellor ofUCSD, "who really linked 
UCSD's future greatness to the 

establishment of a great library." 
The first steps to formulate a 

major university library were 
taken before the UCSD campus 
was officially opened. In 1958, the 
staff of the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography Library, in the 
absence of a head librarian, began 
to acquire materials for a graduate 
school of science and engineering. 

The first official University 
Librarian, Melvin J. Voigt" was 
named in 1960 at the founding of 
the UCSD campus. After the uni-
versity's main library was moved 
to the new campus in the bottom 
floor of the present-day Galbraith 
Hall, the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography Library became a 
branch of UCSD Libraries. 

In the late 1960s, the Central 
University Library was construct-
ed by William Pereir:i & 
Associates. A functional renova-
tion on the building was complet-
ed in 1993, at which time the 
building was renamed the 
"University Library Building." 

The University Library 

Building was renamed once again 
in 1995. The current name, 
Geisel Library, was instated in 
honor of Audrey and Theodor 
Seuss Geisel for the contributions 
made to the university and its 
Ii brary system. 

Today the system consists of II 
libraries. In 1974, 14 years after 
the appointment of Voigt as 
librarian, the one-millionth vol-
ume had been added to the UCSD 
library collection. The two mil -
lion mark was reached in 1992. 

In addition to celebrating the 
acquisition of the three-millionth 
volume, those in attendance 
applauded the attainment of vol-
umes 2,999,9fJ9 and 3,000,001. 
Donated by Ellen Revelle, volume 
2,999,999 is titled "Historia 
Fucorum." 

"The University of California, 
San Diego Libraries presents an 
enviable reputation for the excel-
lence of their services," said 
keynote speaker and Yale 
University librarian Alice 
Prochaska said.

actual frame and not just the tire," 
Luu said. 

According to Jenkins, education 
is a big component in crime preven-
tion, and sometimes the students 
don't know how to properly secure 
their bikes, and instead lock them to 
the branch of a tree or to wire 
fences, where thieves can easily snlp 
off the branch or snip the wire. 

Students who register their 
bike have a much greater chance 
of recovering it than those who do 
not, Jenkins said. 

"You should know the serial 
number arid make of your bike," 

Officer Ian Happle said. 
"Registering your bike is your proof 
of ownership. If we see that the bike 
is not registered, we assume it is 
stolen and we impound it." 

Students are also advised to 
store their bikes in their suites 
during breaks or long weekends, 
and refrain from keeping them 
locked outside for long periods of 
time. 

"We always ask the students 
when and where they last saw 
their bike, and there is a gap 
between when they last saw it and 
when they found ou[ it was 
stolen," Jenkins said. "They have 

tIiis false sense of security, and it is 
. the students' responsi bility to take 

the necessary precautions." 
Matt G unn , a freshman at 

Eleanor Roosevelt College, dis-
covered his bike was stolen after 
returning from a three-day week-
end in January. 

"I used a coil lock, and I doubt 
that I locked it improperly," Gunn 
said. "I didn't ' register my ~ike 
because I Ojust got it, so J knOIY I 
have zero chance of getting it 
back."

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN II 

Guardian blind date strikes out again in 
attempt to help two strangers find love 

Matt Hart strolled into the Guardian office hiding his nervousness behind a smile, two different colored roses, and a 
bottle of moderately-priced champagne. 

A blind date hand can be a tough one to 
play, but Hart seemed to have nailed it down 
with his selection of gifts. The two roses 
said, "Since I have no idea about what you 
are like, you aren't worth a dozen. In case 
)'ou are a goddess, I am not showing up 
empty-handed." The roses were different 
colors - One was some shade of orange 
which says "friendship,» the other was red, 
which says, "how you doin' ?" The bottle of 
low- to mid- range cham-

" 

even if this girl had the perfect personality, 
she would have to be a seven or above (on a 
scale of 10) to get a second date. 

Lisa Nguyen walked into the office with 
a confident smile and apprehensive eyes. 
She gave off a great first impression in her 
knee-high boots and sleek, pulled-back hair 
- she hit the "I'm trying to work my legs, 
but I swear I'm sophisticated" look perfect-
ly. It was obvious Nguyen was playing it 
safe on her first blind date, with lots of 
smiles, self-assuredness and z.ero expecta-
tions. She made it clear that her biggest 
turn-off is a clingy, passive guy. Nguyen 

would either love the guy 
pagne played right along the 
same line. Within seconds of 
meeting his date, it was clear 
that Matt wished that he had 
either thrown in a few extra 
bucks for the dozen or come 
empty-handed . 

Hart was rocking the 
Regis Philbin look ... 

within the first few minutes 
of meeting him or tear him 
apart mentally for the rest 
of the evening. 

Nguyen's attitude for the 
evening can be summed up 
in a single mantra: I'm 
going to have fun, unless 
he's a leech. This mind-set 
has not dampened her dat-
ing experience; she dates 
frequently (she went Out on 
a date just a couple week-
ends ago!), but has dated 
very few guys from UCSD. 

Hart was rocking the 
Regis Philbin look: silver 
shirt, silver tie, hair gelled to 
imperfection. It was a look 
thar seemed to say "I'm 
down to parry" and "( love 
my mother," which pretty 
much seemed to sum up 
Hart nicely. He considers 

Nguyen roUed into 
the office with a 

confident smile and 
apprehensive eyes. " 

ind daters 

himself to be a family man, has 40 first 
cousins, and was pretty sure he'll be married 
within 1 0 years. Some of his favorite UCSD 
pastimes include drunken garbage can tack-
ling during Sun God and hitting up the bar 
scene in Pacific Beach, where he resides. 
Hart never dated a fellow Triton before and 
recently ended a relationship with an older 
woman. With no expectations for the night, 
he really just wanted to meet someone new 
and have a good time. Hart had a que sera, 
ItTa attitude; he was going to play the night 
by ear. 

That being said, Hart informed us that 

When asked why, she tites 
their dinginess and neediness as reasons. 
Nguyen is looking for someone to accept 
her for the independent person she is. 
Nguyen is also low-maintenance - to pre-
pare for a date , she simply showers and gets 
dressed. Her ideal man is self-assured and 
not afraid of her individuality. Most impor-
tantly, Nguyen needs a guy to have a great 
sense of humor. If he's not up to her expec-
tations but makes her laugh, she might just 
forget that he's spineless. Her perfect date 
would be a picnic on a beach, so the evening 
ahead complete with a limousine ride and by moonlight should not be a terrible dis-
dinner at a restaurant overlooking the cove - appointment. Her blase attitude slightly 

. faltered, though, when she tried to inquire 

being "not spectacular," even "ho-hum." 
Perhaps they should just be friends, she 
said. When asked if they did anything after 
dinner, she replied that she went straight 
home and did some pr9gramming home-
work. 

about Hart. The surprise was not to be 
ruined, and she was inste'3d led to the 
Gruzrditm lobby w~ere. the couple met for 
the first time. 

Just seconds before Hart turned around 
to meet his date, the tension could be cut 
with a chainsaw. 

The meeting was, to put it simply, awk-
ward. With GUllTdUm staff looking on (we 
couldn't help it), Matt handed her the roses 
and proudly showed off the bottle of cham-
pagne after politely inquiring if she drinlcs. 
The couple was whisked away to the limo, 
where they promptly opened the bottle of 
bubbly and started to try to make what Hart 
felt was forced conversation. Aher last-
minute pictures and words of encourage-
ment, they headed off to dinner. 

The next day, Nguyen sounded indiffer-
ent. The verdict on the date was harsh. 
According to her, nothing Hart could have 
done would have helped. There was 
absolutely no chemistry. She was happy that 
they started drinking at the beginning of 
the date in the limousine. Nguyen claimed 
it was a definite plus, and made the date a 
lot better. The evening is described as 

Hart chimed in right along the same 
lines. Slightly ticked that she went straight 
home to do homework on a Saturday night, 
Hart seemed reassured that his bread-and-
butter meal of dating older women was the 
way to go all along. While he said hi s first 
thought of her was that she was "cute and 
seemed cool," he didn't sound too disap-
pointed that she blew him off for a night 
alone with a calculator. He found this move 
ironic in light of the fact that she told him 
a number of times throughout the night 
that she l1,ad a "crazy" personality. Hart 
never saw it. 

During his the final interview, Matt lin-
gered for a moment on the phone, hoping to 
eke something more than a free dinner out 
of the whole Gruzrdian Blind Date experi-
ence. "I am still single and looking," he said 
before hanging up, in hopes that some spe-
cial Gruzrdill7l reader might recognize him on 
campus and decide to approach him. We 
promised to let the world know. Only sevens 
and up need apply.

12 HIATIJS THE tX::sD GUARDIAN 

The Ultimate Makeout Mix 
Seventeen songs to get your lips movin' 

By KATE LElsERsON 
Staff Writer 

Sometimes people say, "Valentine's Day isn't just for couples." Actually, it pretty 
much is. All the flowers and jewel-
ry and chocolate and candlelit din-
ners are marketed to couples. The 
holiday is a commitment-fest . . 

That doesn't mean that the rest 
of us, the unattached, have to miss 
out on the opportunity to · have 
some fun of our own. Don't have 
someone to make out with on 
a regular basis? Find some-
one to make out with once and 
leave him or her by the wayside. 

Sure, Valentine's Day is a giant 
exercise in commerciality, aimed 
at convincing us that conspicuous 
consumption communicates sin-
cere feeling. But it's not going 
away, so you might as well 
find a way to enjoy it, 
even if that means twist-
ing and perverting its 
traditional meaning in 
favor of carefree makeout ses-
sions or commitment-free dates. 

No matter what the perspec-
tive on the holiday, it's admittedly 
a good occasion for lcissing. 
Acrually, almost every occasion is a 
good one for lcissing, save for 
funerals and midterms, bu~ ~ 
Valentine's Day puts a specially. 
focused lens on it. To make 
your lcissing experience the best it 
can be, you'll have to work on 
your technique, but if that's in 
poor shape I suggest you try read-
ing YM magazine. But here's some 
help with the atmosphere - more 
particularly, the music. 

The following list of tracks fol-
lowing is compiled from a list of 
suggestions, 70-strong, from 
about 30 people. All of them are 
easi ly downloadable, or at least I 
hear they are; I respect the RIAA 
too much to steal music. Without 
further ado, the Makeout Mix: 

1. Elvis Costello - "I Want 
You" 

It has been said that Elvis 
Costello described this song as "a 
pornographic snapshot, a squashed 
box of chocolates and a little blood 
on the wall." Who knows if it's 
true, but it's definitely apt. 

2. Garbage - "Queer" 
I'm a straight girl, but even so, 

I would totally make out with 
Shirley Manson. The degenerate 
and perverse have never been so 

hot as they are being 
crooned from her lips. 

3. Fiona Apple -
"Slow Like Honey" 

This is slow and sensual, like 
so much of Apple's music, and 

sexy in a "sex on a 
sort of way. 

4.Handsome Boy 
Modeling School - "The 
Truth" 

The track that started it 
all. Everybody needs a 

mix CD that 
includes this song. 

Bare piano melody, naked 
drum in the background and 
sultry vocals laid on top. 

5. Nine Inch Nails 
- "Closer" 

Yes, seriously. It 
doesn't say "lciss" so 
much as "SEX" in huge, 
bold lettering, but it's a great song 
if you want something fierce and 
primal. 

6. The Foo Fighters -
"Darling Nikki" 

The Foo Fighters' cover wins 
over Prince's original version 
because Dave Grohl possesses the 
sexiest scream in the world. 

7. Paula Cole - "Feelin' 
Love" 

This song is the only reason 
Paula Cole is allowed to exist. 
Major points for lyrical dirtiness 
in this one: "You make me feel like 
the Amaron is running between 
my thighs ... " 

8. R.E.M. - "10m You 
Inside Out" 

Michael Stipe releases his no-
holds-barred passion in this unre-
lenting rock song. 

9. The Cure - "Lullaby" 
The lyrical content of "Lullaby" 

is sick, but the dark, plodding 
melodic line is intoxicating. 

10. The HUDters and 
Collectors .-,; ' "Throw Your 
Arms Around Me" 

An Australian favorite, this 
song is one of the few on the mix 
that could be interpreted as 
entirely devoid of sexual intent. 
But its pure sweetness and catchy 
melody beg for liploclr neverthe-
less. 

11. Imogen Heap - "Come 
Here Boy" 

Intent self-evident. 
12. Vanessa Daou - "In the 

Black Forest" 
Breathy vocals · over tribal-

sounding drum beats. 
13. The Supreme Beings of 

Leisure - "Never the Same" 
The best of chill-out music by 

the Icings of house. 
14. The Cocteau Twins -

"Cherry-Coloured Funk" 
The Cocteau Twins' gibberish 

lyrics are like the whisperings of 
sweet nothings in this unique, fan-
tastic song. 

IS. Norah JaDes - "Turn 
Me On" 

Balanced between arousal and 
affection, Jones' music is short, 
simple and sweet. 

16. AI Green - "Let's Stay 
Together" 

One of the greatest contribu-
tions to music £ram the 1970s. 

17. Massive Att,ck 
"Teardrop (ponisbead mix)" 

Portishead brings a heady beat 
to Massive Attack's compelling, 
dreamy melody. 

All you need now is a partner 
and an issue of YM and you're set 
to go. Happy kissing. 

Ladies, beware! Lovers to avoid 
From 'Bruno' to 'emo boy,' look out for these five lovers 
By JESSE KML 

Staff Writer 

As the smell of roses and can-dies fill the air, we have yet again found ourselves in that 
sappy world we call Valentine's 
Day. But before you go rushing 
out to purchase your loved one a 
teddy bear or inexpensive jewelry, 
look at some of these "lovers" to 
be wary of on this very special day. 

1. The Jack Johnson 
Impersonator 

This particular "lover" is most 
often found rucked away in a dorm 
room with a guitar in hand and a 
simple dream of getting laid. 
Although the chords he strums are 
mellow and laid back, his motives 
are anything but innocent. 
Devoting three years to the guitar 
in an attempt to learn every main-
stream pop hit in the past 40 years, 
the JJI plays with his dorm door 
wide open, playing just loud 
enough for unsuspecting girls to 
"overhear" their favorite cheesy 
pop hits and be lured into his well-
crafted trap. My recommendation: 
enjoy the tunes, but make a bee-
line for the exit when he starts to 
show you his collection of NOW! 
volumes one through eight. 

2. The A.I.M. Confessor 
With emotions running high, 

and sweat graz.ing his brow, the 
A.I.M. Confessor has decided that 
today is the day that he will have the 
courage to ask you out Spending 

his days downloading the latest 
buddy icons, the AIM Confessor 
has most likely never spoken to you 
before. Bordering on obsession, his 
secret crush has taken control of his 
life. After picking up your 1M. 
name from a school handout, he 
proceeds to read all of your away 
messages and buddy info. After 
convincing himself that he knows 
everything about you, he pours his 
heart out in a glorious display of 

" Us skinny white males lovingly refer to [the 
Bruno} as le douche 

because let's face it, this 
guy's a total douche bag." 
cowardice. Although you may 
never physically see this man, make 
sure that you don't piss him off, 
because he knows a little too much 
about viruses. 

3. The Stalker 
Just one tip: Stalkers all seem 

to breathe really heavily, so watch 
out for that. 

4. Bruno (k dMIdIe) 
For all you ladies looking for a 

man who loves the gym, Bruno is 
the guy for you. Although Bruno is 
in peak physical condition, he never 

seems to be working out Instead he 
frantically combs the gym for 
attractive young ladies. He quickly 
lends them his "expertise" in physi-
cal training and is more then happy 
to spend hours on end showing 
these women the right way to work 
out. He manages to do all this while 
a skinny white male is suffocating 
under the bench press. Us skinny 
white males lovingly refer to him as 
Ie tkmche because let's face it, this 
guys a total douche bag. Usually 
sporting a sleevdess Gold's Gym 
T-shirt and a flattering pair of 
sweats, Bruno can be found at Main 
Gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
from 2 p.m. until whenever the 
"hotties" leave. 

S. The Classic Emo Kid 
Armed with only a pen and his 

feelings, the Classic Emo Kid is 
ready at any moment to break 
down into a heap of emotions. 
With Death Cab For Curie playing 
softly in the background, the Emo 
lcid pricks his finger and spins a tale 
of woe and lost Inve with his own 
blood. An easy way to identify this 
kid is that he is always wearing 
black and, if you look into his eyes, 

. you can see the pain of a child who 
is convinced that life is one big 
Dashboard Confessional song. 

Hopefully, this article has been 
informative and helpful for all of 
you ladies looking for a Valentine's 
Day free of these interesting char-
acters. It can't emphasized 
enough: watch out for Bruno.

Hungry for love: Guide to 
great Valentine's Day eats 

The best local restaurants to cater to every 
need, both romantic and economical 

ByVUMAI 
Staff Venter 

Hungry? It's Valentine's Day, and as the legend of St. Valentine might put it - let's eat! Ain't 
no better way to celebrate the day 
of love. Here's a little San Diego 
dining guide for dummies - a 
good way to gratify the clueless 
one's taste. 

First, for all those Don Juan and 
Don Juanita hotshots who crave a 
chance to make a dazzling impres-
sion on that new pair ami, a bit of 
gold can go a long way. These 
restaurants run a bit pricey, but can 
be well worth it. 

Aux Delices off\!rs a pre-
planned "Valentine's Day Menu" 
that includes various appetizers, 
main courses, deserts and an 
intermission with live amuse-
ment. All this for only 550 per 
person. Yes, it is a tad expensive, 
but now one can be lazy yet look 
cool lind rich at the same time. 
Reservations are highly recom-
mended and are done only with a 
credit card. To malee a reserva-
tion, call (858) 549-9751. Am 
Delices is located on 6904 
Miramar Rd ., Suite 201, San 
Diego. 

Some may pine for a 
little something more 

Now for the real deals - where 
to find the cheap. eats. Keep in 
mind, an inexpensive dinner by no 
means has to be un-romantic. A 
cheap dinner can always lead to 
much more fun and perhaps even 
more spicy things on a Valentine's 
night agenda. 

Deep in San Diego's Little Italy 
is Filippi's Pizza Grotto. 
Connected to an old Italian mar-
ket, Filippi's offers nothing more 
than the classic checkered table-
cloths and 100-perce nt pure 
Italian pizza goodness . As un-
romantic as it sounds, Filippi's 
offers a great environment for 
dates to stare lovingly into each 
other's eyes. OK, not really. It 
does, however, stir up a very' casu-
al environment that allows for 
great conversation. There aren't 
any sruffy waiters hovering over 
the dinner tables refilling water 
glasses after every mill imeter of 
depletion. The price is between 55 
and $15, however, and no reserva-
tions are necessary, though early 
arrival is recommended. Fillipi's 
Pizza Grotto is located on 1747 
India St., San Diego. For informa-
tion, call (619) 232-5094. 

Kabuki Sushi is another 
restaurant that offers the same 
casual milieu. The restaurant is not 

Uset up in any exotic or' fancy fash-
creative: try Forever/! ~ 
Fondue. Here's a place I 
that will feed one's --::::::::;:::;'l 
belly and challenge r-

ion and there aren't

rant serves nothing ~./ 
but fondue . ~ 
Fondue appetizers, ... 
fondue main courses and 
choco-tastic fondue 
desserts. Forever 
Fondue is half dinner, -----
half game. This is a restaurant 
that will make you work for your 
food. The price runs around 520. 
Again, reservations; there is a 
location in Mission Valley on 
6110 Friars Rd., San Diego, and 
the phone number is (619) 295-
7792 . There is also another loca-
tion in La Jolla on 1295 Prospect 
St.; the phone number is (858) 
551-4509. 

Pricey list out, moderate fine 
dining from here on out. Not willing 
to spend a lot of money due to an 
unsure or possibly undesirable date, 
yet still want to look impressive? 
Here are some easy restaurants. 

Casa de Bandini in San 
Diego's Old Town is a sure way to 
go. Mexican ddights for' the rea-
sonable price range ofS5 to SIS? 
jEt mlly bumo! Shell out another 
couple bucks and get serenaded 
by a mariachi band. Also, one can-
not forget to mention the gigantic 
margaritas at Casa de Bandini. 
They are so huge, even a horrible 
date will end up fantastic by the 
end of the night, guaranteed. Casa 
de Bandini is located on 2754 
Calhoun St., San Diego, in the 
middle of the Bazaar del Mundo 
courtyard; the phone number is 
(619) 297-8211. Reservations are 
only taken for large parties. 

For someone who dares to ven-
ture into the wild, 'i!!te Bombay 
Exotic Cuisint; of . a. One can 
try authentic tandoori chicken and 
naan bread, all the while grQOVing 
with some authentic Indian beats. 
The off-the-wall paintings add 
some real flavor to the food. 
Bombay ranges within SIO to $20. 
It is located on 3975 5th Ave., Suite 
100, San Diego (Hillcrest area). 
The phone number is (619) 298-
3155. Reservations are recom-
mended. 

v-' on the walls. 
Kabuki does offer, 

however, a special 
sushi center-piece bar 
which serves sushi on 

floating boats 
on a small river 
bed surrounding 

Qt the sushi chef-
masters . It 
can't get any 
cooler than 

that. Diners pick 
off whatever plate of sushi they 
desire and the waiters and waitress-
es keep count. There is no dress 
code other than "no shirts, no 
shoes, no service.~ The price range 
is very fair: between $5 and $15, 
depending on the plate. There are 
no reservations - $he restaurant 
works' on a first-corne, first-serve 
basis. It is located at 4475 Mission 
Boulevard in Pacific Beach. For 
more information, call (858) 270-
1986. 

Those who want to stray from 
the exotic cuisines can go to Seau's 
for some all-American food. One 
of San Diego's top sports-themed 
restaurants, Seau's offers an array 
of hamburgers, sandwiches and 
more. There is no other word to 
describe this resta~ant than casual. 
A date at Seau's cannot go wrong, 
for once it starts hitting that bore-
dom spot the diners can always 
resort to the television screens 
filled with sports action, live enter-
tainment (depending on the night) 
or maybe even just happy hour. 
Also, if money spent on food isn't 
enough, diners ean go to the adja-
cent souvenir shop and buy sports 
paraphernalia. This is customer 
service at its best. Seau's prices 
range between $5 an.d S12. Seau's is 
located at 1640 Camino Del Rio 
North, Suite 1376, San Diego 
(Mission Valley area). The phone 
number is (619) 291-0241. 

If all else fails on Valentine's 
Day, one can always eat. San Diego 
offen a whole lot more than the 
restaurants given here, but this is a 
guide to a possible great Valentine's 
date. If the date doesn't work out, 
at least there was the great food 
and, if you're over 21, the great 
drinks!

Man-hater? How about just stickin' it to the · men? 
short kids 
are cool 

Anne Cong-huyen 

APparently I 'm a "man-hater." As sad as this sounds, I've been told this on several occa-
sions by several different people. 
But I don't thinft that I'm a so-
ca ll ed "man-hater." I always imag-
ined "man-ha ters" to be bitter, 
emasculating women who castrate 
men a nd hand their balls back on 
Styrofoam pla tes. I'm not at that 
stage in my life quite yet and I 
don't hate men. At the moment, I 
am nothing more than picky. Can 
a girl really be blamed for havi ng 
some discriminatory tastes? 

SinCe Valentine's Day is near-
ing and so many people are scram-
bling about trying to find a special 
someone (or anyone) with whom 
they can spend this commercial-
ized, commodified holiday, I 
thought it would be appropriate 
for me to examine the trajectory 
that has led me to be what some 
call a "man-hater." This history 
will serve as a defense and a logical 
explanation for why I am the way I 
am, and I know that I am not 
alone. Many, many women out 
there are like me. Ladies, thi s is 
for you. 

Let me first say that as part of 
my own nature, I have reservations 
about dating. Period. I don't quilt 
understand the entire social rirual 
that is dating, and it only confuses 
me. It seems a rather risky busi-
ness: single people going out and 
trying to present their most attrac-
tive side, physically and personali-
ty-wise. Ask any girl what she 
wants in a guy, and the majority 
will say they don't care what a guy 
looles like as long as he's smart and 
funny and can hold a conversation. 
I'm sorry to speak poorly of my 
own gender, but thi s is a bunch of 
bull. It does matter what a guy 
looles like. Sure, it helps if they're 
clever and witty and have similar 
political leanings, but this isn't 
always the case and I've known 
more than a few guys who think 
they can get away with a dashing 
smi le and a hot body. But good 
looks can only hold two people 
together for so long - in my case, 
the average is about three weeks. 

Case in point: I dated a guy 
from San Diego State (no need to 
tell me, I've learned) who initially 
seemed sweet and considerate. 
The fa ct that I liked to read was 
thoroughly amazing to him. But 
when he thought "spending time 
together" meant going with his 
friends to parties and getting piss-
drunk, he became rather irritati ng . 
The last straw should have come 
much earlier, but it came after 
three weeks when h e got drunk 

and decided to beat up my friend 
who was half his size. After their 
bloody escapade, he had the con-
sideration to ask me if I was mad at 
him in a low voice with big puppy 
eyes. Dumbass! Of course I'm 
mad. With a character like this, it 
doesn't matter how good-looking 
he is . It shouldn't matter how good-
looking he is, but somehow I've

of bull." 

got this feeling that he 's still out 
there being a beast, wooing other 
girls and beating up theit friends. 

Here's a tip for all you guys out 
there: Unless a guy is attacking us, 
we're not impressed if you beat him 
up. 

Then there are the so-called 
"nice guys" that you've been 
friends with forever. Even though 
you know he's a player, you end up 

Be my bloody valentine and donate 
This Valentine's Day, give blood, marrow or pledge donor status 

By ALU QUICK 
Contributing Writer 

This Valentine's Day, you might consider giving the greatest gift of all : the "gift of 
life." Just ask Olympic snow-
boarder and organ transplant 
recipient Chris Klug. Last April , 
Klug visited UCSD for the 
nascent campus student organiza-
tion "Donor Dudes." Klug dis-
tributed autographed posters to 
students who displayed the "life 
dot" on their driver 's license to 
encourage life-saving organ dona-
tions. For years, Klug was at the 
top of his sport, quietly battling 
liver disease Primary Sclerosing 
Chaolangitis, the same disease 
that killed football great Walter 
Payton. 

In addition to traveling the 
world for snowboard competi-
tions and pursuing his other 
loves, surfing and kite-surfing, 
Klug serves as the national 
spokesperson of America's 
largest annual one-day life-sav-
ing donation drive, Saturn 
National Donor Day. The day 
has been held on or near 
Valentine's Day for the last six 
years. National Donor Day is 
sponsored by 16 national non-
profit donor agencies and it 
addresses each of ways that one 
can donate: blood, marrow, and 
organ and tissue . 

Blood saves approximately 
10,000 lives eve (I while 
60 percent of adul ~hgible to 
donate, onl y 5 percent do so. 

"I used to give blood in high 
school, but I haven't done it since 
I've come to college. I guess I am 
just busier," Thurgood Marshall 
College freshman Danny 
Neidlinger said. 

UCSD students are not the 
only ones who have difficulty 
finding time to donate. 

"There is currently a blood 
shortage in San Diego County 
and across the nation, " said 
Tammy Glenn, a volunteer coor-
dinator for the San Dieg<J Blood 
Bank. "It is typical during this 

time of the year, usually begin-
ning around the holidays, when 
people are busy and may not 
make the time to donate. Of 
course, the need for blood is 
constant, regardless of the holi-
day season, and the San Diego 
Blood Bank urges anyone who is 
at least 17 years old and in gen-
eral good health to donate 
blood." 

Another type of life-saving 
donation encouraged this 
Valentine's Day is marrow dona-
tion. Each year, about 30,000 
Americans are str icken with 
leukemia and similar diseases 
that are potentially treatable 
wi th blood stem cell transplants. 
One-third of those affected will 
find a match within their family. 
The other two-thirds will look to 
the National Marrow Donor 
Registry for a match from a 

- stranger. Americans in general 
and members of minority ethnic 
groups in particular are encour-
aged to join the registry. To join 
the registry, only a small amount 
of blood is taken and then your 
tissue characteristics are record-
ed in a database. You will be 
called to donate if someone with 
matching tissue is in need of a 
transplant. Even if you cannot 
give blood, you can still register 
to be a marrow donor. 

Also driving the Saturn 
National Donor Day are the 
80,000 patients on the transplant 
waiting list. On average, 18 peo-
ple die every day because a suit-
able organ donor is not found in 
time. To commit to being an 
organ donor, people put pink 
"life dots" on their California 
driver's licenses. Lifesharing 
Organ and Tissue, San Diego's 
government-chartered organ 
procurement organization , 
stresses discussing organ dona-
tion with families because per-
mission must always be given by 
the donor's family. Everyone is 
encouraged to be an organ 
donor, regardless of age or health 
problems. 

"Being a donor is such an easy 

way for anyone to save a life," 
Sixth College sophomore 
Christine Nguyen and vice pres-
ident of Donor Dudes said. 
"Donating blood takes IS min-
utes and you'll save a life . 
Deciding to be an organ donor is 
easy too, and when the time 
comes, you can help up to 50 
people. We encourage everyone 
to give "the gift of life this 
Valentine's Day, along with 
candy and flowers." 

If you want to celebrate 
Valentine's Day 2004 by giving 
the "gift of life," there will be a 
blood drive by the San Diego 
Blood Bank Feb. 17 to Feb. 19 at 
Price Center Ballroom A. Organ 
donor stickers will also be avail-
able at the blood drive . To make 
an appointment to donate blood,

blood and marrow donation, visit

tion is available at http://www.lifo-

situation that can only end badly. 
Especially if he's a poo-poo head 
who thinks he can get away with 
sleeping with all his girl friends

each other. All right, so this didn't

story, but the guy doesn't have to 
ignore her or make her feel 
insignificant. Good grief, at least 
be civil. We've got feelings, too! 

And we mustn't forget the no-
good rotten liars . Cliched as this 
sounds, these guys don't just exist 
in movies - there are men who 
are real-life cads. Another dear 
friend of mine met a seemingly 
pleasant, funny and unrepulsive 
guy on vacation and found out 
that he lived near her parents. 
These two started seeing each 
other and my friend would travel 
a good three hours every other 
week to see him. But.this guy was 
not the nice fellow he had pre-
tended to be. Oh, no. My beauti-
ful friend was stood up, not once 
but twice (!), and then she discov-
ered that he 'had a girlfriend. That 
dog! And it didn't end there. 
Nope. He even contacted her 
months later (by Instant 
Messanger, no less) to tell her he 

had moved down to San Diego 
and to beg her forgiveness. It 
sounds ridiculous that this would 
actually happen, but it does, and it 
happens to nice girls all over the 
world every day. Sorry to sound so 
dramatic, but I'm standing up for 
my fellow women. 

And those were only a few sto-
ries from only three different girls. 
Imagine the countless other stories 
from women who are dating aim-
lessly in the dangerous world of 
single (and not-so-single) men. 

Of course the stories could be 
reversed. There are many insane 
and stupid girls out there who are 
just as cruel or thoughtless to guys. 
So, being the benevolent person 
that I am, I shall now offer a service 
to all you single men and women 
out there. Go ahead and submit 
your "love resumes" and allow me 
and my staff to evaluate your no-
good-dog level. Find out whether 
you're a jerk or a winner. And per-
haps you could even get matched 
up with a similar person, because 
we all know how risky dating can 
be. Or you can be like me and save 
yourself the uncertainty and the 
pain and just worry about things 
that 7Nltter for the time being. 

My plan if I never find the per-
fect man: I can always adopt kids 
from third-world countries. After 
all, I'm a woman of the 21st centu-
ry. To quote Destiny's Child, 
"Ladies, it ain't easy bein' indepen-
dent." 

Vagin~, vagina, vagina: 
'Monologues' return 

Series of monologues returns to 
raise awareness of domestic abuse 

By ANN SHEN 
Staff Writer 

The Vagina has arrived. The Vagina Monologues, that is. A project that has been slowly but 
steadily promoted and produced 
through a dedicated group of sru-
dents at UCSD opens this week in 
honor of National V-Day. The "V" 
symbolizes Victory, Valentine and 
Vagina. 

Originally a one-woman, off-
Broadway show written and per-
formed by Eve Ensler in 1998, the 
monologues have

with the production for most of her 
college career. She started as an 
actor and then moved to co-direct 
and direct. "Every year is different 
because we have different people in 
the cast with different interpreta-
tions. I hope that for the people 
who were fortunate enough to get 
tickets, [they) will get an ey'e-open-
ing experience and think about 
things they hadn't thought of 
before," she said. 

The cast consists of 44 diverse 
females, each from different back-

grounds and with 
different reasons for 
why they got 
involved. Angie 

transformed into a 
worldwide phe-
nomenon in the 
crusade to stop 
violence against 
women. College 
campuses and vol-
unteers around the 
world contribute 
their time and 
efforts to put on a 
V-Day production 
every year. Most 
of the proceeds go

Cary, a Thurgood 
Marshall College 
senior, is a first-time 
performer who saw 
last year's show and 
was inspired to get 
involved after hear-
ing all of the stories. 
Cary performs her 
piece, "Reclaiming 
Cunt," with confi-
dent, powerful sex-

ing violence against women. 
Through the V-Day productions, 
the movement is propelled by cre-
ative projects to educate and bring 
awareness to the subject of violence 
against women occurring daily. 

This year's production at 
UCSD includes cast and crew of 50 
passionate young students, mostly 
female, who all rave with a glint in 
their eyes about the production and 
their involvement. 

Co-producer Steph Levenstone 
laughs, saying, "I got sucked into 
the Vagina, and once you get 
sucked in you never get out." 

Levenstone has been involved 
with the production for two years. 
Director Jenn Pae, a Revelle 

uality. 
"I think my piece empowers 

women to take charge of their own 
sexuality," says Cary. 

Most pieces in "The Vagina 
Monologues" deal with exploring 
the female power and the vagina, 

. which offers something education-
al for both female and male audi-
ences. 

Kerry McGrath, a graduate 
student, decided to become 
involved as I way to get back into 
theater. 

McGrath said that the show 
has "been truly amazing. [It's) one 
of the most powerful things to see

She performs another monologue eno-

monologues, ensemble pieces are an mte-
gral part of the performance. The ~ieces are 
hilarious, heart-breaking, and heahng. 

Levenstone explains that the sets are 
simple and the costumes a~e broken down 
into color themes to keep It plam because 
"the words are [what are) important: the 

words are powerful." The cosrumes, which 
are usually red and black, added pink this

The performances adhere to s.trict guide-

with thumping drums and uncharac-

but ultimately sound nothing like 
anyone else. Though more start1ing-
Iy original on previous releases, Xiu 
Xiu now malces a musical statement 
that is both more accessible and 
more frightening than ever before. 

In one song alone, Xiu Xiu will 
move from safe, purposefully rrite 
indie-rock to a sonic attack of clang-
ing percussion and heavy synths 
which moclc the ridiculousness of 
craving musical safety. In "r Luv the

It's been said to everyone at some point, and maybe it was believ-able before arriving at the vapid

There's a method to this madness

ver you can use to 
stan a conversation 
is to ask your target 
if you can borrow 
notes beca use you 
missed lecrure a few 
times last week. 
From there, you will 
most likely get a 
phone number or an 
immediate stroll to a

Dating in college is less about

there are a substantial number of

it from there, Casanova. Plus, there

can srudy for. 

Use the fact that you have a

See DATING. Page 21 

THE 17th ANNUAL 

By ANDR~ Rlos BOLUNGER 
Staff Writer 

It is refreshing to see artists who are so amazing at what they do and stick to what they are good 
at. Erykah Badu's newest album, 
Worldwide Underground, released 
last September, keeps to her tradi-
tional style but pushes the limits of 
her talents and experiments with 
musical and vocal improvisation. 

For those of you unfamiliar 
with the work of Badu, she is 
known for her beautiful, soulful 
voice, distinct vocal style and 
poetic lyrics. She is an activist, as 
she proved at the Jan. 31 Hip-
Hop Summit at Texas Southern 
University in Houston, Texas. She 
spoke to the youth and said, 
"Everything you do that does not 
conform to the system that is try-
ing to program you is a political 
statement." Badu strongly 
believes in using one's actions 
wisely and in positive, communi-
ty-improving ways. 

On Worldwide Underground, 
Badu collaborates with great 
musicians and vocalists such as 
Roy Hargrove, Angie Stone and 
Bahamadia. T he songs are mostly 
pleasant and enjoyable. The song 
"Mama's Gun" is a low point of 
the album, but with the track 
"Worldwide Underground" Badu 
is undenia bly at the top of her 
game. The album has an incredi-
bly jazzy feel, too, with a few 
tracks bumping her more popular 
and well known R&B feel. 

To distinguish the finest tracks 
on Badu's new album is a difficult 
task. The songs "Think Twice" and 
"Love of my Lifc Worldwide" most 
definitely stand out. On "Think 

Twice," Roy Hargrove explodes 
with his jazz talent on the trumpet, 
while Angie Stone and Bahamadia 
shine on "Love of My Worldwide." 
The album fits together perfectly, 
starting out mellow and smooth, 
climbing to a deep movable beat 
and smoothing out again with the 
concluding songs. It is perfect for 
just· reluing - or you can lay it 
down for mood music. 

Lyrically, the album is stunning 
- but what can really hook a lis-
tener is the way it sounds. The 
beats, vocals, composition, 
melodies - everything is very well 
done. The only faults are found on 
a few tracks, like the introductory 

songs, which get very repetitive in 
the lyrics, but it still sounds 
enchanting. 

San Diego is about to get a taste 
of Badu's singular sound when she 
comes to 4th and B on Feb. 12. 
Badu's performance promises to 
combine the best songs off of 
Worldwide Underground 
(although her guest artists are not 
scheduled to appear) along with her 
past hits. Floerry, a two-woman 
R&Blspoken-word group, is per-
fonning with her, which should 
give the show a great lyrical combo, 
and if we are lucky they will collab-
orate on something. For more 
information, call (619) 231-4343.

Dating: Learn the ins and 
outs of courtship at UCSD 

continued from page 20 
smaller-class-sized sections offer -
you'll be able to draw more attention 
in a smaller section, especially while 
the droning grad srudent up front is 
making it quite impossible not to 
check out everybody else in the 
room. 

On-campus job: GeTting an on-
campus job for a few hours a week 
not only puts a little coin in your 
pocket, it's a great way to meet a new 
corps of co-workers. However, these 
are not the best reasons for checking 
the bulletin boards for an opening. 
You know those hot girls working at 
A.S. Lecture Notes? Or maybe the 
nice boy who looks like Dan Cortez 
driving the Regents shuttle? That's 
because they are fixtures we interact 
with on a daily basis - highly visible 
fixnrres at that. 

Whjle off-campus internships are 
a practical way to boost your resumt!, 
no one is going to approach you at a 
pany and say, "Don't you do data 
entry for Prudential?" They will 
know YOli if you're a suds-dispenser 
at Poner's Pub, an lD-swipcr at 
RIMAC or a Sunshine Store clerk. 
Being in contact with till many sru-
dents during a three-hour shift can-
not be a bad thing. ate: There is 
such a thing as visibility overkill, so 
working at a dining hall should be 
considered with caution. 

Dorms: Once you move off 
campus, you ' ll end up residing any-
where from Del Mar to Mira Mesa 
to Claremont, and the density of 
attractive peers per square foot will 
decline drastically. Enjoy the cooed, 
on-campus residence hall s and 
apartments while you can. Dorm 
life is convenient across the spec-
trum : Potential mates and beds 
high in demand are also high in 
supply. Note to on-campus girls: 
The best way to a man's heart is 

through his stomach, and chances 
are he'll be very grateful if you let 
him tap into your meal plan if he's 
staying over. (Food is food to guys, 
no matter how disgusting you think 
the beef strogan-cold is.) 

If you have a roommate, you 
have probably had the "sexiled" 
chal by now. Always keep a spare 
pillow, blanket and sleeping bag in 
the living area so that you don't 
need to dig through a closet while 
your hook-up gets impatient. And 
if you do sexile your roommate, 
proper etiquettc requires thaI you 
buy him or her breakfast in the 
morning to compensate for an 
uncomfortable night of sleep. 

Also, if you don't like coffee, 
learn. Once you learn, Grove 
Caffe's laid-back setting and tasty 
brew make it a great place to meet 
someone for a first date. 

Srudent organizations are not 
only lining Library Walk to 
"change the world ," but are also 
advertising themselves as a place 
where you can meet people. 
There are ethnic orgs, political 
orgs, media orgs and so on that all 
introduce an ar ray of social func-
tions. 

Student Heal th Services, the 
abortion rights groups on Libraty 
Walk and the Women's Center often 
provide free condoms. You can also 
get "checked out" at Srudent Health 
to keep you and your mate safe. 

Finally, be yourself if you are 
genuine.ly interested in maintaining 
a relationship. Tf you want to be aha, 
you'll be treated like a ho. Nobody 
really wants to be alone on 
Valentine's Day, so now's YOllr 
chance to pay the piece of ass across 
the hall a visit and make him or her 
forget about his or her long-distance 
relationship. Good luck and 
Godspeed.

Tennis: Rookie Seth Spector 
victorious in his debut 

continued from page :J8 
make balls and win the last point." 

The Tritons launched off to a 
quick start by taking all three dou-
bles matches in only 40 minutes. 
Firing on all cylinders, all three 
Triton doubles teams were ahead 
simultaneously, 4-1, and never 
looked back. 

The third-ranked doubles pair 
of seniors, Sameer Chopra and Jeff 
Wilson, finished off Cal Poly 
Pomona's David Nguyen and 
Guido Weidenfield, 8-1, without 
breaking serve. 

"Jeff made a lot of balls early on, 
and that gave me confidence to play 
well the rest of the match," Chopra 
said. 

Chopra indeed played well, fin-
ishing his singles match just as eas-
ily as his doubles match without 
breaking his serve. He defeated 
Andy Chang in straight sets, 6-1 
and 6-2, at the No.2 slot. 

At No. 2 doubles, junior Bryan 
Swatt and senior Arnir Nejad sound-
ly defeated the Chang twins, Andy 
and Alan, 8-2 . The lCitons' clean 
sweep of doubles put them at a 3-0 
advantage in the first half of the 
match, and then they proceeded to 
take five of six singles matches. 

"We got ahead early in doubles, 
and we definitely had a more 
aggressive attitude, and part of that 
has to do with this being the second 
match," Steidlmayer said. 

Nejad also handed Alan Chang 
his second loss of the dual match, 
beating him in straight sets. The 
lone Broncos victory was at the 
No. I singles slot where Nguyen 
beat Swatt in a close match, 7-6 
and 6-4. 

UCSO continues its dominance 
over Cal Poly Pomona - a team 
they swept in all three matches last 
season. 

The Tritons faced Hawaii-Hilo 
on Feb. 12 and swept them, 9-0, at 
the Northview Tennis Courts. 

The Los Angeles Unified School District is seeking teachers in the following 
subject areas: 

"My game plan was to play 
loose and free and just hit the hell 
out of the ball," Chopra said. 

Wilson handed Weidenfie1d his 
second loss of the dual match by 
defeating him again, this time at 
No. 3 singles in straight sets, 6-4 
and 6-1. 

The Tritons played a lightning 
match, violating the Vulcans up and 
down the court, frustrating and 
exhausting them in under two hours.

THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 12,2004 

Water polo: 
Tritons can't 

capitalize 
against the 
Hoosiers 

"They worked hard out there, and 
they weren't getting what they 
deserved." 

A new day only brought the 
same old trouble as the offensive 
maladies continued against 
Indiana. Defensive pressure was 
almost overwhelming, allowing 
only one goal in the opening peri-
od and four goals in the first half. 
UCSO had plenty of opportuni-
ties, including II six-on-five 
chances, but could only muster 
one goal from Lyman in the mid-
dle of the third period to cut the 
Hoosier lead to 5-\. Any momen-
tum was immediately shut down 
by a goal on Indiana's next posses-
sion, and the Hoosiers rolled on to 
an 8-1 victory. 

"We weren't crashing or drop-
ping like we were supposed to, and 
people weren't actively moving or 
playing their roles," Sanders said 
of the sluggish defense. 
. UCSO's final game of the tour- . 

nament against UCSB offered a 
chance for the Tritons to redeem 
themselves and salvage the week-
end. In what turned out to be a 
nail-biter from start to finish, the 
UCSO defense gave an inspired 
performance, constantly pressur-
ing the Gauchos at two meters 
with efficiency and drawing only 
twO ejections throughout the 
game. 

In fact, each UCSB goal came 
not from offensive persistence, but 
from lucky bounces and miscues, 
exemplified by UCSB's second 
goal of the first quarter. Lombardo 
made the initial save on a one-on-
one situation, but the ball landed 
in front of a surprised Gaucho 
player, who simply pushed the ball 
in for the score. 

UCSO's junior utility 
Courtney Clevenger displayed 
good timing in drawing defenders 
away to sink one in the Gaucho 
goal to cut the lead before the 
half. After UCSB scored on a 
breakaway in the third period, the 
Tritons tried furiously to find 
those points that would get them 
back in the game, but once again 
the offense came up short and 
time ran out. 

Despite the 1-3 performance 
and a 2-6 overall record, the pro-
gression of quality in team play 
throughout the tournament 
reflects a push toward a single, 
efficient mode of play for UCSO's 
young squad. Game experience, 
certainly to be bolstered by 
UCSD's next game at home 
against Cal State Northridge on 
Feb. 13, is va luable and the defen-
sive cohesiveness displayed is what 
excites these young players most of 
all; it is a stepping stone to the big-
ger games and successes that lie 
ahead . 

"It is frustrating knowing that 
we have so much talent, and we 
can't put it all together just yet," 
Bantilan-Smith said. "But· the 
more we play these tournaments, 
the morc we'lI play like we did 
against UCSB, and those games 
make us feel good about ourselves 
and our play."

26 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Arena: UCSD's one win comes against Hartwick ' 
conrinued from page 28 

the opening whistle, a focal point 
in practices stemming from 
UCS D's inefficiencies to get a 
jump start at the Michigan Invite, 
was the key to the Tritons' victo-
ry over Hartwick. Within two 
minutes of the start. an aggressive 
UCS D offense pressured 
Hartwick into forcing a six-on-
five advantage. The Tritons set up 
a man-up offense that bunched 
players in front of the goal, giving 
Bantilan-Smith time to pump and 
toss the ball into the left corner of 
the cage for a 1-0 lead. 

UCS D carried the aggressive-
ness over to the defensive end, 
crashing to knock out the two-
meter defender, evident in the 

five ejections drawn in the third 
quarter, and pressing the drivers 
into making bad passes. Whatever 
Hartwick threat UCSD couldn't 
thwart, bad luck made for a for-
midable substitute; almost every 
shot the Hawles took sailed just 
wide or struck a post. By halftime, 
UCSD had mounted a 4- 1 lead 
fueled by junior driver Jessica 
Wong's two goals and bettering 
the three scored in the opening 
periods of the Michigan Invite . 

"We were putting away all of 
our shots, and in this game, as in 
any, it was a huge boost," UCSD 
goalie Stephanie Lombardo said. 

In the fourth quarter, however, 
Hartwick came storming back 
from 6-3 down, muscling its way

at two meters and scoring four 
goals, including three in a 1 :21 
stretch. UCSD, however, held its 
ground with three goals and big 
defensive stops, including a phe-
nomenal one-on-one save by 
Lombardo with less than a minute 
and a half to play. 

Advancing to the winner's 
bracket, the Tritons met up with 
Loyola Marymount in a jewel of 
an opportunity to feel out its tOP 
conference rival early on in the 
season. UCSD jumped out early 
once again; this time, junior utili-
ty Tobi Lyman fired one into the 
mid-left corner of the LMU cage 
with only 45 seconds elapsed in 
the game. On their next posses-
sion, the Lions moved the ball 
quickly to two-meter offense 
Devon Wright, who fired a quick 
toss over Lombardo to tie the 
score only 12 seconds after 
UCSD's breakthrough. 

Lyman's goal would be 
UCSDs only success on offense 
all afternoon; as speed and scor-
ing slowed to a trickle, and the 
Tritons were forced to abandon 
efforts at two meters due to a 
physical LMU defense that 
couldn't keep its hands off UCSD 
players. Without a UCSD offen-
sive attack, LMU ran away with a 
10-1 victory, led by Jessica 
Conner's four goa ls. Triton head 
coach Larry Sanders felt that the 
Lions' success in shutting down 
UCSD's offense came from a lack 
of calls awarded for fouls that, at 
the same time, the Tritons were 
being charged for. 

"We weren't getting the same 
calls that LMU was getting, so we 
had to take it easy and that was 
unfair to the girls," Sanders said. 

See WATER POLO, Page 23

continued from page 28 

er against Alliant International 
University. 

"The lesson that we learned 
today was that no matter where 
you are in a match, you can sti ll 
pull it out," Westerman said. "If 
you just play point by point, then 
you're sti ll in the match." 

It'll be key for the Tritons to 
turn on their match-mentality 

mode, especially coming off such 
a long period of practicing match-
es against themselves. 

"This [match-mentality) will 
just come as the season progress-
es," Westerman said. "We have all 
the techniques, we just need to 
implement them." 

The next match for the 
Tritons will be on the road on 
Feb. 14 aga inst a tougher and 

more competitive Cal State 
Bakersfield team. 

Then UC5D will take on Cal 
State Los Angeles on Feb. 16 in

Buick: Na, 20, will make fourth PGA start 
coruinued from page 28 

Another notable player that 
will be teeing it up this week is 20-
year-old Kevin Na. The youngest 
member of the PGA Tour, who 
resides in Rancho Cucamonga, 
Calif., will be making just his 
fourth career PGA start this week-
end. 

Na, who turned professional at 
the age of 17 , bypassed his senior 
year of high school and college to 
play on the Asian and European 
tours. Na had six top-10 finishes 
in 2003 on the Asian tour, but 
other professionals say it's rare 
that a young gol fer like Na can 
find success so soon after making 
the transition from amateur golf 
to professional. 

"Most of them just aren't 
good enough," said PGA veteran 
Corey Pavin, a graduate of 
UCLA. "You have to be able to 
play at a consistent level. A lot of 
young golfers have trouble 
shooting the lower scores consis-
tently." 

Na has shown he belongs on 
tour, recording an average 18-
hole score of 69.6. Last year, he 
made the cut in 12 of 14 
European events, and in his three 
events this year, Na has made the 
cut twice. 

"I'm just going to have to work 
hard," Na said about finding suc-

cess on the PGA Tour. "It will be 
difficult for me ... but since I've 
played two years of professional 
golf and then got on the tour, that 
will be an advantage for me." 

In addition to battling the 
7 ,607 -yard South Course of 
Torrey Pines, the weather for the 
weekend calls for strong winds. 
During the opening round of the 
tournament on Feb. 12, the fore-
cast predicts 10 to 15 mile-per-
hour winds coming off of the 
ocean, and tha t trend is expected 
to continue through Feb. 15, forc-
ing players to hit lower shots out 
on the course. 

"Tee shots will be important, 
and so will the height and spin of 
each shot because of the strong 
winds," said golfer K.J. Choi, who 
has been playing on the PGA Tour 
since 2000. 

All 156 players in the field will 
have a chance to battle the wind 
on the first two days of the Buick 
Invitational. Each golfer will play 
one of the two opening rounds on 
Torrey Pine's North Course, and 
the other on the lengthier, more 
challenging South Course. Then, 
after the cut is made before the 
start of the third round, the 
remaining players will play the 
final two days of the tournament 
on the South. 

Buick Invitational tickets for 

any day of the tournament can be 
bought for $12 at the Price Center 
box office, while they will be sold 
for 520 at the gate on the first two 
days, and for 525 on Feb. 14 and 
Feb. 15.

Baseball drops series finale to Sac State 
Tritons go 1-2 against the' Division I Hornets 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Sen iar Staff Writer 
The UCSD baseball team 

dropped the series finale against 
Division I Sacramento State by the 
slim margin of 3-2. The Hornets 
took game one of the series, 6-5, 
and the Tritons won game two, 7 -5. 

With the loss, UCSD falls to 5-
2 overall. 

"We didn't play our best baseball 
and found ourselves very much in 
the ballgame until the last pitch," 
O'Brien said. "Thats a good sign. 
But we can't accomplish our goals if 
we don't play consistent baseball 
throughout every weekend series. 
Looking at the big picture, we lost 
two one-run baJlgames to a Division 
1 team and feel as though we should 
have won alJ three. Our guys know 
that we belong, and they act that 
way." 

The Tritons got on the board 
first in the bottom of the third 
inning. With two outs, senior 
rightfielder David Hawk singled up 
the middle. After Hawk stole sec-
ond, sophomore leftfielder Damian 
Fante smacked a single up the mid-
dle and plated Hawk. 

Triton sophomore pitcher 
Byron Grubman, the 2003 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Freshman of the Year, 
took the hill for UCSD. He had 
only given up two singles and three 
walles through four innings of play. 
Grubman would go on to throw six 
inninv, give up two runs on five 
hits, and strike out four H(>rnet 
batters. 

Hill MoyIlA/Guordion file 
Hit fwd: UCSD shcmed a strong pitching performance in the final game of the 
series against the Hornets, but the Triton staff gave up 22 hits in the first two games. 

Sacramento State put singl~ 

runs IlP in the top of the fifth and 
sixth innings. 

UCSD, down 2-1 in the bottom 
of the sixth inning, knotted the 
game up at two when senior first 
baseman Jeff Riddle hit a two-out

Keith Hernandez from second 
base. 

Junior transfer pitcher Justin 
Allred came on in relief of 
Grubman in the top of the seventh 
inning. 

Hornet second baseman Jack 
Arroyo led off the top of the sev-
enth inning against Allred with a 
solo home run to left-center field. 
The run proved to be the game-
winner, and Allred took the loss 
falling to 1-1 on the year. 

Sacramento State pitcher 
Warren Rosebrock earned the win 
for the Hornets and improved to 1-
O. He went six innings and gave up 
six hits, two runs and two walles. 
The Hornets' victory improves 
their record to 5-2. 

For the Tritons, Fante and 
Riddle each went 2-for-4 on the 
day with an RBI apiece. 

The Tritons open their 2004 
CCAA season this week with a 
four-game series against Cal State 
Los Angeles. Single games at home 
on Feb. 12 and Feb. J3 will begin at 
2:30 p.m. The four-game series 
then moves to Los Angeles for a

participating in the event is No. 1-
ranked player in the world and 
Buick Invitational defending cham-
pion Tiger Woods. Woods, who 
won the 2003 event by four strokes 
over Carl Petterson, will return 
from a month-long break in com-
petition to defend his title and hold 
onto his o. 1 ranking. 

Southern California natives Phil 
Mickelson and Scott Simpson will 
also be in the field . Mickel on, who 
was a coreboard bearer at the 
Buick as a teenager, grew up play-
ing at Torrey Pines and has a lot of 
experience on both the North and 
South Courses. His familiarity with 
each of the 36 holes is evident by 
three Buick Invitational titles. 

San Diegan Scott Simpson grew 
up playing junior golf in La Jolla, 
and ays he's at "home" when he's 
playing at Torrey Pines. In fact, 
when he wa younger, the 48-year-
old Simpson hit balls at the UCSD 
driving range, which has recently 
been torn down.

No. 10 UCSD 
destroys CPP, 8-1 

.Men's tennis team drops 
just two sets to Pomona 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ

The No. 10-ranked Division II 
UCSD men's tennis team saw 
strong play from its established 
players as well as the younger ones, 
namely sophomore Brent Molden 
and freshman Seth Spector on Feb. 
10, demolishing No. 23 Cal Poly 
Pomona, 8-1. After being edged 
last week by Azusa Pacific, the 
Tritons improved their play and 
got down to business. 

"We played a little better," 
UCSD head coach Eric 
Steidlmayer said. "Azusa [Pacific] 
is a better team than [Cal Poly 
Pomona], so that's a difference, but 
we definitely played a little better." 

In addition to winning his dou-
bles match with senior Nick 
Morton, Molden battled through 
his singles match against Seth 
Lewkow. Although he was serving 
5-4 in the first set, Lewkow came 
back and forced a tiebrealcer which 
Molden took, 7 - 1. Molden gained 
his stride thereafter, blanking 
Lewkow 6-0 in the second. 

In the court next to Molden, 
Spector made his rookie debut at 
No. 6 singles and succeeded, 
adding another point for UCSD. 

"He got to play a little bit," 
Steidlmayer said. "He played well 
and he's been practicing well . ..

The women' tennis team 
handed Point Loma Nazarene an 
8-1 loss on Feb. 10. This was the 
Tritons' second non-conference 
win since the sea on started on 
Feb. 4. De pite the seemingly 
lopsided score, the Sea Lions 
were a tough match for the 
Tritons, givi ng many of the play-
ers some clo e calls. 

"This match was defini tely a 
lot tougher than thl;! score 
showed," Triton team captain 
Juli e Westerman said. "The 
game were actually closer than 
the actual set scores, but we 
played the important points well, 
and it was good tune-up for the 
season to come." 

The Tritons had two three-
et matches in the singles lineup 

and some very close wins in dou-
bles. At o. 2 singles, Jasmin 
Dao gave a grea t performance, 
winning her first se t 6-4 and 
then coming back after trailing 
1-4 in the econd set to win . At 

o. 1 singles, Westerman man-
aged to outmaneuver her oppo-
nent after a 5-7 first-set los to 
win the match, 5-7, 6- 1 and 6- \. 
T he only loss for the singles 
came at the No. 4 position, in a 
ve ry close 2-6, 7-5 and 7-5 
three-set defeat. 

The Tritons' doubles lineup 
offered tiff competition, and 

managed to sweep the three 
matches. Westerman teamed up 
with Tara Siddiqui to defeat 
their opponents at the No. I 
doubles position, and Dao 
played with Kristin Bronowicki 
to hand Point Lorna an 8-6 loss 
at No.2 doubles. The only line-
up change since the Tritons' 
first match against Point Lorna 
was at the No.3 doubles posi-
tion. Jenny Ishii stepped in to 
play wi th Katie McKee, com-
pleting a clean 8· 3 sweep. 

Siddiqui is making a come-
back off the injured list, starting 
at No. 1 doubles. Last year, she 
was playing in the singles lineup 
but, due to shoulder and knee 
problems, was forced to take the 
summer off to regain and build 
strength. 

"Point Lorna gave us a pretty 
decent match, they definitely 
made us work for the win," 
UCSD head coach Liz LaPlante 
sai d. "The lesson that we 
learned today was that a match 
can change very quickly - you 
can be on the verge of match 
point and then find yourself in 
another set because your focus 
was lost." 

Point Lorna definitely tested 
the Tritons' focus and mental 
toughness on Feb. 10 in a much 
more challenging match than the 
UCSD's victorious season-open-

T he Triton women's water 
polo squad has started the 2004 
season as a rebuilding year after 
suffering a disappointing 1-3 
record at the UCSD Arena 
Invitational on Feb. 7 and Feb. 8. 
Opening with a strong 9-7 victo-
ry over Hartwick, the Tritons 
proceeded to stumble through 
three consecutive losses to 
Loyola Marymount by a 10-1 
margin; Indiana, 8-1; and UC 
Santa Barbara, 3-1. UCSD 
rounded out the tournament with 
a sixth-place finish . 

Yet, following their final game 

of the grueling weekend, each 
member of the Triton team 
stepped out of the pool proudly, 
ignoring the ugly truth displayed 
on the scoreboard and commend-
ing themselves on a valiant effort, 
marking its victories through 
progress, not points scored. 

"It was a good weekend for us 
progressively ... we did stumble 
against LMU and Indiana, but by 
finishing intense and improving 
like we did against UCSB, we 
didn't see the game as a loss at 
all, " UCSD co-captain Meris 
Bantilan-Smith said.

L ennox Lewis is a coward. Nevermind the 41 -1-2 record over a 14-year 
career, nor the title as reigning 
heavyweight champion of the 
world . Lewis' decision not to agree 
to a rematch against Vi tal i 
K1itschko indicates that he is afraid 
to respectfully pass on the title. 

Lewis is breaking unwritten 
rules of athletic competition: the 
champ cannot quit at the last 
moment before being defeated . 
He is like that kid playing tag on 
the playground who always calls 
timeout right before he gets 
tagged, then later brags about how 
he never gets tagged. I hate that 
kid. 

On June 21, 2003, Lewis and 
K1itschko battled at the Staples 
Center in Los Angeles for six com-
plete rounds, after which the refer-
ee declared Lewis the champion, 
despite the fact that he was losing 
to K1itschlco by points. The mas-
sive gash above Klitschko's eye 
could not be mended, and the ref 
was forced to call a technical
