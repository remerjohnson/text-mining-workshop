OSHPP Director Search Continues 
QUEST: Dynes 
appoints a search 
committee to fill spot 
By Anna Valsman 
Senior Staff Writer 

A year has passed since Office 
of Sexual Harassment Prevention 
and Policy Director June Terpstra 
res igned . Although Chance llor 
Robert Dynes immediately 
announced a search commi ttee to 
find a new director, one has yet to 
be found. 

It is unclear how much longer it 
wi ll take to fi nd a new direc tor. 
Estimates from involved parties 
range anywhere from one month to 
three months. 

''\'m hopeful that the full proce-
dure will be completed by the end 
of March." SO Ass istant 
Chancellor Linda Wi ll iams said . 

However, Williams added that 
the search may stretch out to late 
May, depending on how soon the 
se lected candidate can take the 
POSI. 

The search commi ttee is cur-

Chasing the Wind 

rently reviewing resumes from a 
pool of candidates, she said. The 
pos ition was posted in early 
January. and recrui tment concluded 
on Feh. 2. 

The tea rn is headed b 
ommittee on the Status of Women 

Chair Deborah Wingard , who is 
also a pro fessor of fami ly and pre-
ventive medicine.

Discussion Held on Black Panther Party 
TALK: Rhodes 
discusses portrayal of 
group in mass media 
By Kathryne Lee 
Staff Writer 

Jane Rhode , an as ·istant pro-
fessor of ethn ic studies, gave a talk 
on "Visuali zing Bl ack Power: 
Telev ision News and the Black 
Panther Party" at the Cross 
Cultural Center yesterday as part 
of the on going Faculty-in-
Residence Series. 

Rhodes' di scussion revolved 
around the media ' portrayal of the 
Black Panthers, a 1960s militant 
black activist group that promoted 
complete armed revolution by 
African Americans. Started by 

Huey Newton in Oakl and, 
Cali fornia, the Black Panthers ral-
lied behind many lefti st issues. 

The Panthers were against the 
Vietnam war and supported the 
right to carry firearms in public. 
According to Rhodes, the Panthers 
also believed the U.S. government 
was run by "white rac ists." 

According to Rhodes, people 
should be skeptica l when viewing 
minority portrayals on television 
during the heyday of the Panthers. 

Rhodes said that the media pro-
vides little representation of 
minorities, and that there seems to 
be a di sproportional amount of 
sensationalist material. 

According to Rhodes, the 
media in the 1960s was always 
focused on a narrow frame such as 

whether the Panthers were a vio-
lent or non-violent group, whether 
they believed in segregation, or 
whether they believed in violence. 

"The media was trying to make 
the Bl ac k Panthers pal atable 
news," Rhodes said. 

By focusing on pre-determined 
mindset of what the Black 
Panthers were, the media left out 
substantial information about the 
Panthers that the general public 
did not know. For example, little 
coverage was given to the group's 
"breakfast program," which was 
devoted to community service. 

Yet, Rhodes said the Panthers 
used the media's bias against them 
to their advantage.

Ads Tied 
to Teen 
Smoking 
STUDY: Teenage 
experimentation linked 
to promotional items 
By S. Javan Wygal 
Staff Writer 

One-third of all teenage ex peri-
mentation with cigarettes can be 
attri buted to tobacco adverti sing 
and promotional items, accordi ng 
to researchers at the UC San Diego 
Cancer Center. The results of their 
study are published in the Feb. I l! 
issue of Th e Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 

Thi s report comes amid 
Congressional hearings over inter-
nal memos at RJ . Reynolds which 
allegedly detail deliberate research 
into the teen-smoking market. 
Researchers hope that this study 
will increase Congressional pres-
sure and result in stricter regula-
tions regarding the advertisement 
of tobacco products. 

Charles Berry, adjunct profes-
sor of Family and Preventive 
Medicine at the Cancer Center and 
a co-author of the paper, said that 
"any paper like this would be use-
ful" in strengthening the case for 
legislation aga inst the tobacco 
industry. 

"But studies I.like thi s one] 
which specifically link medi a 
advertising and promotions with 
the behavior of teens are quite 
rare," Berry said. 

Elizabeth Gilpin, of the Cancer 
Prevention and Control Program 
and another co-author of the study, 
also commented on the effects of 
the study on the Congressional 
hearings.

'The concerns she had rai sed 
would delin itely rail w ithin /the 
management review/ ." Ki rkpatrick 
said. 

A management review commit-
tee, externa l to UCSD but internal 
10 the UC system, conducted an 
analysis or the OSHPP last May. 
T he committee was composed of 
two o fficials from the UC Office of 
the Pres ident. as we ll as two Title

who spec iali zes in sexual harass-

Voz Funding Suspension 
Within A.S. Power 

At the end of fall q uatler, Vo" Frmlt l'ri?ll - an 
As~oci<lted Students (A.S.)- funded a lternative-media 
publicati on foc used on C hi cano-Mexicano i ~s ues -
published 23,000 copi es of a ~i ng l e, 12-page issue, 
overspending its tOlal alloca ted budgl:t by $87. 10. As 
a res ult of V()" printing thi s many copi es without prio r 
A.S. approval. coupled with the overspendi ng, A.S. 
sLi spended Voz funding for winter quarter. 

The line- item all ocations in V()Z'S budget perrAit 
printing Lip to 4,500 copies of two issues that are 
betwee n 12 and 24 pages each, pe r quarte r. Moni es 
not spent as a llocated within the budget before the 
end of the quarter are then funne led into the Media 
Una llocated budget where they may ultimately be 
used by any other alternative media. Conceivably, if 
the funds remain unused, they will be incorporated 
into ne xt year's A.S. budget. 

WI(, Fmnleriza chose to publish only one issue fall 
quarter. Instead of publishing within its budgeted 
guidelines of 4,500 copies of one 12-24 page issue, it 
used its total budget, and then some, to print a 12-page 
paper at nearly four times the allotted num ber of issues. 

When an organization of any kind receives A.S . 
funding, it is g iven a line- item allocation . This means 
that it receives specific amounts of money to be used 
for specific ends. This money is not to be freely 
moved <lround from ite m to item. The organization 
must app ly to the A.S. fi nance committee to reallocate 
funds within the organization's budget, if des ired. 

Vo" Fmnleriza reallocated its funds without A.S . 
approval. The paper also overspent its budget without 
A .S. approval. The money that Voz Fronteriza spent 
is not the group's money, it is not AS. 's money, it is 
student money. 

It is the job ofthe A.S . to fairly a llocate the money 
it co llects from the student body. It does so by estab-
[i shing bylaws, regul ations .which the council and 
student organizations both must fo llow. Al so, it 
establi shes contracts which student organi zation and 
alternative media core members are required to sign . 
These contracts indicate the members ' unde rstanding 
that the group must follow the bylaws, or they are 
subject to the consequences ou tlined therein. 

According the AS. media bylaws, "[n the event 
that a media vio lates thi s charter or other by-law, the 
media shall be notified in writing that its A.S.-funded 
budget will be frozen until a hearing consisting of the 
A.S. Media Advisor, Commissioner of 
Communications, and Y.P. Fi nance determines the 
scope and penalty of the violation ." This is what Voz 
did , and the A.S . reacted according ly. 

The AS. manages student activity money. It should 
therefore be taken seriously. The AS. must follow 
through with and uphold its policies, making no excep-
tions for students. organi zations nor the administmtion. 

The A.S. was within its ri ght to suspend Voz 
Fmllleriza' s funding for one quarte r and therefore set 
a precedent for all other alternative media - that 
budget allocations are not to be misused, and that the 
A.S. will not tolerate any organi zat.ion 's noncoopera-
tion with A.S. guidelines . 

It is our opinion that there were no race-based rea-
sons for suspending Voz Fmllleriza's funding , and 
that the A.S. was full y wi thin its right and responsi -
bi lit y to the stude nt body to do so.

RAINY WEATHER 
DESERVES ApPRECIATION 

COMMENTARY: Sun-loving Southern Californians' paranoiac fear and grave 
dislike of noisy thunder, blinding lightning and pouring rain is unwarranted 

MEG A N 
K LEI N 

Reality Check 

Splashl 
" Yippee l" I yclled as the water 

poured around me. I jumped into the 
nexI puddle and the next. Water 
splashed arou nd me, the trees were 
dripping and the grass squi shed under 
my foot sleps. 

Dressed in a bright ye ll ow rain-
coat , suspended rain pants with sus-
penders and rubber boots, I waded 
through a wide puddle while students 
wi th weI. stringy hair dressed in 
damp jeans and sweatshirts tiptoed 
around the mud. I laughed at them 
and charged through the water. 

Rainy days are the hest. 
Unfortunately, thi s view is shared 

by very few people, especially in 
southern California. It seems that 
every forecasl for rain in San Diego is 
equivalent to say ing everyo ne's great-
uncle Leo died. People prac ticall y go 
into mourning. Whal is the dea l wit h 
hating Ihe rain '! 

I cOllie from norlhern California , 
more s p~c i fi ca ll y, the Bay Area and 
mon.: sp~cifica ll y than th at, th~ city of 
Napa . For lhose of you who have 
never had the pleasure of spending an 
cx tended period of winter in the Bay 
Area, it rains up there - con~tantly . 
Buckets and huckcts of rai n. day after 
day. 

For the pa ' t three years, Ihere has 
not been a day of Janu:lry thaI wasn' t 
vi sited by some moisture ru ll ing from 
the skies onlO Napa. 

Every day during the winler, you 
wake up and get dressed for th..: cold , 
damp weather. There is. no point in 

Get over It! Rain 
doesn't ruin plans. 
Instead of going for a 
picnic, take a walk

(the water Is

tooking out the window hefore you 
don your jeans and sweaters because 
the sky rarely changes. While thi s 
may he depress ing to so me people, I 
love it. 

When some people wake up, they 
arc excited to be greeted by thaI 
bright. hot, fiery ba ll we ca ll the sun . 
I am less than cheery. To me, the sun 
means no clouds and therefore no 
rain . Give me dark, ominous clouds 

any day. 
The Napa Valley. while most 

famous for its wines, is also famous 
(at least to the people who live there) 
for its annual floods. Though some 
years are worse than others flood-
wise, it is quite rare 10 experience a 
winter in which the word "sandbag" 
is not mentioned in the newspaper 
multiple times. 

Floodi ng just happens; it 's a part 
of life. People expect it and know 
what to do when it happens. A bunch 
of rain is no big dea l. 

So when all these SoCal people 
stan complaining about the slightest 
bit of precipitation, I start to laugh. If 
you can' t stand the rai n, move to the 
desert . 

Rain is the greatest thing . It 
sounds greal ; il feels great; it looks 
great, and it smells great. How could 
anyone not like rain? 

It is nature's car wash and the poor 
man 's irrigation system; a puddle is 
an endless supply of joy for a chi Id 
and on rainy nights, the sou nd of the 
rain is a soolhing lullaby. 

However, for everyone in southern 
Calirornia, rain may as we ll be a mas-
sive swarm of locusts descending to 
ki ll us all. Televi sion and radi o 
weather forecaster al ways de li ver 
the news of prohahle rain with an 
a I most apologet ic tone. 

"I' m sorry," they say, pointing 10 
the swirly group of clouds otT the 
coast on the weather map, "hut it 
looks like we are in for a few days or 
rain . Sorry 10 ruin your weekend 
plans." 

Get over it! Rain doesn' t ruin

Thursday, February 19, t 998 The UCSO Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: Upon turning 21 years old, this columni t discovers that the path to happiness lie buried under the burden 
of understanding and maintaining relationships with other people and decides to share her new-found wisdom with her readers 

COMMUNICATE, TAKE RISKS AND UNDERSTAND YOUR FEARS 

Messing With 
Your Mind 

As of yet. I do not full y, or 
even partia ll y for thai malter. 
understand how men and women 
relate to each other, and I' m rather 
pos itive 1'm not alone. 

For a long time, it wasn ' t real -
ly necessary ror me to think 
about how members of the oppo-
site sex communi cate abou l sen-
sitive issues because I had been 
dating the same guy since I was 
16 years old . I I' I had so met hing 
to say, I just sa id it. I didn ' t have 
10 worry if I'd offend , if I wou ld 
. care him away or if I would wi n 
hi s heart. 

Within thi s relati on hip. I grew 
to beli eve that I am full y accepted 
for who ] am. As a resu lt , I 
became confiden t in who I am and 
appreciative of the things that 
made me di ITerent frOI11 the other 
gi rl s. 

[ lea rned to co mmun ica te 
open ly and honestl y and. more 
importantly, I tea rned not to play 
games - they ' re a waste of time 
and energy. 

A person in a secure silllation 
wi ll say and do things wi th more 
directness and less conce rn ahout 
ri sk. That's the idea of a relati on-

ship - a secure situation with a 
direct line of upen comm un ication 
allowing ree lings and emotions to 
he shared. maki ng the participants 
heller, strong.:r, kinder people. 

Interestingly, while most peu-
pic want some form of the rela-
tionship described above, they are 
not able to communicate openl y 
or effectively in order to begin a 
relationship. 

In addi ti on to nOI being ab le to 
communicate, they seem to be 
afraid of the very thing they wish 
to allai n, making commu nication 
almost imposs ible. 

Everyone's hehavio rs and 
allri butes are a result of our expe-
rie nces - co llec ti ve and individ-
ual - and mi ne have made me 
di rect, open. courageous and out-
spoken . This works ror me. It 
makes life eas ier for me because it 
removes doubt, mi sunderstanding 
and. even more importantly. mi s-
trust. 

These are some of the evi ls 
that plague our society, causi ng 
pitfall s and other dangerous si tua-
tions. They make human interac-
tions difficu lt. especially those 
involving both physical and emo-
ti onal intimacy. 

I am someti mes told that I 
over-analyze situ ations, my life 
and more importantl y. others' 
li ves. While this may he true, 
sometimes it is necessary. 

Giving other~ advice when you 

Begin Lent 

(f) 

Fear prevents us 
from realizing that 
everyone else has 
basically the same 
fears. While you are 
sitting there, fearing 
asking her out, she 
is quite possibly 
sitting there, fearing 
that you won't. 
While you fear being 
rejected, he also 
fears rejection. 
fee t they need it and accepting 
advice someone gives yo u as 
appl icab lc to your life is a crucia l 
aspec i of lea rning. Taking advicc 
se riously, and therefore recogni z-
ing the ex istence of a prohlem, is 
the fir~t ~ t ep tu re~olving it. 

ow that I've ctarified the 
is~ u e at hand , that lII en an t! 
women often don' t communicate 
elkc ti vc ly. I can offer Illy so tu -
ti on. Learn to co millunicate clTcc-
ti e ly, honest ly and dire~ tl y . 
Become ex tremel y comfortahle 
wi th communicating cleart y. 

Comillunica tln g erfec ti ve ly 
means lislening to the uther per-
son. Li sten to what she is ac tually 
sayi ng, rather than what you want 
to int..:rprct. Tell him exactt y what 
yo u mean or want , rather than 
hei ng vague and forci ng him to 
figure it out for himse lf. Tell her 
what you are fee ling or thinking 
when it prohably an·cels her. Tell 
him how his feelings :\I1d thoughts 
make you fec I. 

H..: re is some add itional advice 
that wi ll case in terpersonal rela -
tions. 

Act upon what you hetieve 
ra ther than what you think may he 
app ropri ate in a given situati on. 
Have the courage of your ~on vjc­
tions. Seek and accept the trulh , 
no malter how pai nful. and you 
will learn to cope with both 
:lcceptance and rejection on a 
much hi gher leve l. 

In life, rewards arc tantamount 
to the ri sks invo tved in attaining 
th use rewards. Li llie ri sk implies 
lillie reward and. on the saille 
note, great personal risks ca n 
bring great personal rewards. 

Bei ng afraid to take ri ~ k s wi ll 

onl y hring a life of few rewards. If 
you don' t risk a ~ king sum 'o ne 
OUI. you won't get a dale. If you 
don 't ri sk telling so meone ou 
love hilll . you may never know if 
you' re toved. 

Beyond co mlllul1il:ation . 
heyond acccpting advicc, beyond 
taking risks li es thc one thing that 
prevents all of them - fear. Fea r 
prevents us frolll d() ing or saying 
things we want. It paralyzes our 
capaci ty to think, to analyze and 
to act. 

The easiest way to conquer 
fear is to accept that which you 
rear. Sad ly, fear often prevents us 
from realizing that everyone e lse 
has has ica lly the same fears and 
insecurities. While you arc silting 
there, fearing asking her out , she 
is quite possib ly silting there, 
fea ring that you won ' l. Whi Ie you 
fear being rejected. he also fears 
rejection. 

If you reali ze, though, that the 
person whom you fear fears you 
jusl as much , it makes the whoh: 
situation a litt ie morc famitiar and 
tolerabte . 

Letting your fears and in sel.: u-
ri li es control you wi II prevent you 
rrom doing and saying th ings that 
will hring you success and happi -
ness. Understanding your fears , 
intell ectualizing them and pUlling 
them in the contex t of the si tua-
tion wi ll help you uve rcome th ..:m

compelling as her previous ones, 
but one particular passage in 
"Ignorance, Fear, lind Insecurity

requires refutation , or al least alt er-

southern California freeways . I 
rel:a ll hea ring Ihat there were 13M

As an Indonesian Ameri can

"Since I entered college I've 
been on the big identity search. 
W ho am I? W hat's my purpose? 
Where am I going? 

Night and day, we discussed 
the most profound questions w ith 
brilliant. world-renowned 
scholars. We delved into the arts, 
study, nature. All of it through an 
open, pluralistic approach, within a 
Jewis h c.ontext. 

But. there was one question I 
never wanted to ask. The one 
about my Jewish identity. It simply 
didn't interest me. 

So, last year around th is time I 
met a guy. He had depth, 
intellect, and a warm, embracing 
soul. He told me about this place 
with mountains and forests, 
horses and hiking trails outside 
LA where he had spent nearly 
fou r weeks during the previous 
summer. He said it had changed 
hiS life, awakened his Intellect and 
his Jewish soul. I thought. 'no 
thanks, not for me.' 

Then I realized I was envious 
o what he seemed to have . So I 
did something I swore I'd never 
do. I went And it was the best 
thing I ev r did. I me other

SMOKE: 
Teens interviewed 
had not smoked yet 
ContInued from page 3 
nor had a desi re 10 start, even if 

pres~ured by peers. 
When lhey re-interviewed lhe 

leens in 1996, lhey found th8t lho. C 
who had a favo rite cigarellc adver-
tisemenl in 1993 were twice as 
like ly to have started smoki n ~. or 
be willing to Slart. -

Also. lhose who owned or werc 
willing 10 u~e a cigarelw promo-
li onal item in 1993 were neurly 
lhree limes as likely to progress to 
smoking. 

"From these data . we eSlimate 
thaI 34 percenl or all experi menta-
lion in California bel ween 1993 
ami 1996 can be all ribu led 10 
tobacco promotion al activities," 
Pierce wrote. 

The report goes on 10 stale that 
it "provides clear evidence lhat 
tobacco industry advertising and 
promotional aClivities can innu -
ence nonsuscept ible never smokers 
to Slart the process of becoming 
addicted to cigarel\es .... Our data 
estab lish that the influ ence of 
tobacco promoti onal activities was 
pres<!nt before adolescents showed 
any susceptih ilily to hecome smok-
ers." 

During the lhree-yea r period of 
stud y. 41) .7 percent of the teens 
started smoking, 16.6 percenl 
became "susceplihle 10 smoking." 
29.5 percenl had at least ex peri -
menled wi lh it anti 3.6 perccnl had 
smoked at least 100 cigarclles, or

MEDIA: 
Panthers used media 
to their advantage 
Continued from page 1 
their exploitative use of language 
such as constanlly referring the 
police as 'pi gs' brought on media 
coverage for thcm," Rhodes sa id. 

The Panthers used sensational-
ism to promote olher issues they 
believed in, such as action against 
police brulality. 

According to Rhodes, the Black 
Panthers have slow ly heen fading 
into almost a cu 11 followi ng for the 
last couple of ye'lrs. However, 
Rhodes said there seems 10 be spo-
radi c resurgences in Oakland and 
in Indiana. Rhodes added , though, 
Ihatlhe Panlhers no longer promote 
the ex tremist, mil itant tactics of the 
19605.

Malashock 

Dance & Company's 

'Love & Murder' 

debuts downtown 

Story by Ilona fass, 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

or some peop le modern dance conj ures up stereotypes of pretentious 
arti sts who wea r black and like to name drop between sips of Cri stal 
champagne. However, Ihe poinl of SUSHI is to present a variety of 
art forms that appeal to all types of people, regardless of th eir age or 
national ity. 

This is precisely what is a<.:<.:Omplished hy John Mal as hoc k '~ 
"Low & Murder," showing at SUS HI downtown. 

Malashock's pieces can he charn cleri zed by Iheir themes of gen-
der-role reversa l and an excellent sense of humor. 

Malashock ut ili zes each pa rt of the human body, focusing on precise control 
of the musc les and facial expressions. The phys ique and character or the 
dancers themselves, Ma lashock's partiwlar choice of music and a minimalist 

set design combine to create Malashoek's signature style which has earned 
hi m so much notoriety. 

Admittedl y. one may classify some of th e dances as being a bi t "out 
there." even bo rdering on ridiculous. However. one of the central theo-

ries behind modem dance is Ihat it is open to interpretation; there is 
no set criteria for fonnulating one's opinions or making defin itive 
j udgment call s. 

Whether or not modern dance is one's cup of tea, it still forces 
one to redefine the perception of dance as an art form and to exam-
ine the relationship between the mind and body. 

"Love & Murder" opens with Malashock's "Sketchbook : Song 
and Dance," fo ll owed by guest choreographer Katja Wachter's 
"The Leading Questi on" and then fi ni shes off with Malas hock's 
newest prodigy, " Love & Murder." 

Because Malashock presents two different pieces in the same 
evening, the viewer can get a real feel for hi s particular style. 

"Skelchbook" is coni ro ll ed in a slow, precise way as 
opposed to "Love & Murder," wh ich is a hit morc agi-

lated and fasi-paced. It is the simpli <.: ity found in the 
prec ise control of the body that is central to Ihe 
beaut y of '·Sketchbook." Music including pieces 
by David Bowie, Bono, Lou Reed and Julee Crui se 
gives the pieces an intense, surrea l fce l. 

As implied by the name. "Love and Murder" 
can he characteri zed by its emphasis on love and 
death. The move menls mimic dea th, characteri zed 
by puppets on strin gs com plemented by dead-pan 
ex pressions. The result is hoth funn y and hi zarre. 

Sandwiched helween Malashock's two pre-
sentat ions is guest-choreographer Katja 
Wachter's "The Leading Questi on." Wachler 1'01-

luws thro ugh wilh the <.:entra l theme or death hy 
in corporating so mber music. more dead-pan 

expressions and puppet- like maneuve rs. The 
dancers wear brighl hlue-and-orange outfits remi · 

niscent of parade uniforms. 
Wachler has created an intell igent pi ece loaded with 

imagination and humor. She ahemates the "plinkity" 
sound of a toy jack-in-the-hox, wilh nat ionali sti c music such 

as "Pomp and ircumstance." The only naw here is that the 
linal dance continues on for just a bit tou lung. 
Malashock shoult! he commended for his casting talent as well. 

A,sislanl direclors hrb topher Morgan and Tammy Dunsi7.er give e.~pe­
dally compelling perfonnances. BOlh Morgan and Dunsizcr combine 

Ihe rid i culou~ wi lh the vulnerable, the morbi d and the funny to 
create a candid style thai captu l\!s the heart uf self-expressiun.

Sweet-Smelling Marcy Playground 

New York City band brings its somber musings to San Diego on the strength of its hit, Sex and Candy' 
By Jason Ashlock 
Guardian Reporter 

We all hear stori es about the 
band that almost made it. Ringing 
in our ears are the horrific tales of 
bi g-name record co mpanies 
promi sing big bucks, limousines 
and fame, only to get sc rewed up. 
leaving the band members home-
less and selling themsclvc, on the 
slreets. 

An unlike ly Irio from New 
York . Marcy Playground, has just 
proven all Ihose evi l legends 
wrong. 

Marcy Pl ayground are lead 
singer/guilarist John Wozniak . 
bassist Dylan Keefe and drulllmer 
Dan Reiser. The hand has just re-
released its full -length . self-tit led 
album on apitol Records and is 
currentl y in the middle of its "Win-
ter Wonderl and" tour, which makes 
a stop toni ght at 'Canes in Mission 
Beach. 

So. whu are Marcy Playg round 
and why should people listen to 
them? 

In a recent interview wi th the 
Guardiall , Dylan blunt ly replied 
"they dun' t have to." Marcy Play-
grou nd aren't j usl another band try-
ing to markel themselves, se ll 
rec.;ords and make a lot of groupies 
happy. They do it for the love of the 
musIc. 

During Ma rcy Playground's 
tour with Toad Ihe Wei Sprocket, 
their prev ious label, EMJ. folded 
and the band was left without a cor-
porate backer. Despite hav ing no 
way to distribute its music, the 
band was ab le to promote itself 
wilh Ihe help of il s manager and 

ex-employees of EM!. 
The band ended up signing an 

improbable deal with Capilol, and 
today i reapi ng the benelits of its 
heavi ly played single, "Sex and 
Candy." 

Keefe reflected 0 11 the time i 11 
which Ihey were "driving around in 
shitty vans play ing for no one. hop-
ing 10 fint! a new labe l. Pl ay mus ic 
you love. Whether you get a dea l or 
nol. or whether you have a career in 
it or nol, you ' re going 10 ma ke 
great music all your life." 

Keefe cites this as the reason 
why so many people went to bat for 
the band. 

"We di dn' t ti o much to gel 
rcsigned. bUI we were approached 
by Capitol due to the backing of 
some good fri ends," Keefe 
explained . "One of those peo ple 
was actuall y Chris Muckl )' [of 
91 X I who has hecn play ing Ihe 
album since last February, and kept 
pl aying it when all the other sta-
ti ons dropped Ihe band from rota-
ti ons. He IOlall y is our savi or." 

Keefe explained thai the calch-
phrase that became the title of the 
hand' s hil came from "th is woman 
[John] was sleeping with in col-
lege. This woman 's roomm ate 
walkcd in and said, 'Ooh, I smell 
sex and candy in here.'" 

Marcy Playground 's album 
it self is basically a barrage of bal-
lads. 

"John was rea lly influenced by 
storytelling and books probably 
more so than song writers," Keefe 
said of the album's lyri cal cuntent. 
"Actuall y, the onl y guitar solo on 
the whole album is in the song.

" Barf1nRaml11stein!" is what 
one thinks upon first hearing Seltn-

~·iicJlI. the album by Gl!rmun heavy-
metal band Rammstein. 

By Bill Glanzmann 
Senior Staff Writer 

Contrary to popular beli ef, the 
Titanic is un si nkable. With the 
enormous succcss of the film and 
the endl e~s series of low-budget 
imitators left in its wake, the infa-
mous ship that plunged beneath 
the cold waters of the Atlantic in 
191 2 appears to be sai ling on the 
high seas. 

However, if you need greater 
intellel:tual stimulation than bloat-
ed special effect and the callow 
posturing of you ng stars, then 
look no further than Jeffrey 
Hatcher's intrigui ng and provoca-
tive play, "Scotland Road." 

Performing at the intimate Cas-
sius Carter Center Stage in the Old 
Globe Theater, Director Craig 

oel's ti ghtly focused production 
resonates with a unique sense of 
mystery and a faint ly wistfu l tone. 

Set in the present day, Hatch-
er's drama cemers on a young, 
enigmatic woman (Tanya Shaffer) 
found on an ice Iloe off the coast 
of Iceland; she wears 19th century 
clothes and utters onl y a single 
word: "Titanic." 

Since the Titanic disaster hap-
pened more than 80 years ago. 
cou Id thi s woman b<: an actual su r-
vivor or is she not hing mCt rc than 
part of a hoax'! 

John (John Rafter Lee), an 
intense, hrash man who is morbid· 
Iy ob 'essed with the Titanic 
ca lamity. is completely convinced 
that she is a comemptible fraud 
and he will stop at nothing to 
expose her deception. 

However, Doctor Halbrech 
(Katherine McGrath). the tough. 
honest physician who cares for tbe 
nameless woman, opposes hi s ruth-
less tactics and cautiously allows 
him only limited access to her. 

At his behest. Frances Killie 
(Katherine Faulconer), an old . 
irascible Titanic survivor. enters 
the fray to examine and question 
the woman's apparent claim. Even 
though the woman passes all of 
Killle 's tests. an aura of impene-
trable obscurit y surrounds her and 
John redoubles his effo rt s to 
unmask her "true identity." 

Lee 's performance as John has 
such remarkable potency that it 
capti vates the audience and draws

play the perfect c()unterpoillls to 
the rest of the (;<1st - two tough. 
practical women wl10 have an 
unshakable sense of fair play. 

Robin Roberts' minimali st 
scenic design helps shape the 
atmosphere of the drama - the 
austere, spartan-like set gives the 
play an existential sensibility. 

Complementing that efTect are 
the otherworldly indigo lights that 
intemlillent ly shimmer on the ~tage. 
These lights arc reminiscent of 
moonlight on the surface of the sea. 

"Scot land Road" works not only 
as a thoroughly engrossing mys-
tery, but also as a pen 'trating psy-
chological study. Hatcher 's play 
providcs insights into the depths of 
the human psyche, and is a portrait 
of man's seardl for Identity and 
meaning in a turbulent world. 

"Scotland Road" wi ll ru n 
th rough Mar. 15. For more infor-
mation, l:all 239-2255. 

Mandeville 
Auditorium, 
UCSD 

The b;lnd 's se lf-titl ed debut 
demonstrates that it has soul form 
the very beg inning, starring out 
strong wit h catchy ~o ngs and crc-
ative lyrics. The first song, 
"Wired." catches one by surprise 
with its energy and groove. 

"Space" is an odd song that 
would probably appea l to any fan 
of "The Rocky Horror Pictu re 
Show," as the two share the samt: 
campy qua lit y and self-deprecating 
humor - in other word., 10 Speed 
aren' t afra id to "dark" oul. 

Tell Speed contains other fun 
songs and varies in its l11usicu l fla -
vor. Pointing the albulll in a com-
pletely different dir<:ction is "Live· 
Iy," a cool. crisp number which 
takes on a 1Il0re scrious tune. 

Unfortunatdy, thi s shift in 
direction does not succeed. As the 
album progresses it SLU I1s to lose 
points in quality and appeal. 

In genera l. /0 Speed is a fun and 
energetic album and has the poten-
tial to altract a wiele audience. 

-Eran Maor 

The fi rs t half of the album 
begins wit h intros thai conjure up 
images of serenity, distant moun-
tain peaks or fresh-spun trance 
music. That's where the transcen-
dentali sm ends and the musical 
madhouse begins. 

Unfortunately, SehllsiicJlI fol -
lows a predictab le course of heavy 
guitar riffs in conjunction with an 
intimidating. potentially annoying 
voca l section. 

What make Raml11stein's sound 
unique are the different channels 
their music penetrates, while still 
maintaining a heavy core sound. 

At times, the commanding 
voice and guitar riffs make room 
for sweet voca ls and beautiful 
transi tions, bu t unfortunately nOl 
long enough before the demonic 
voice r.:turns and all hell breaks 
loose. 

Although Sehnsiicht succeeds in 
making a musical statement about 
power and beaut y. it loses balan 'e 
overall by incorporating a vocal 
secti on lit l'or the German army.

TEE-GFF: As part of a competitive squad this season, Tritons golfers must think 'You are what you shoot' to remain at the top 
By Sean Rahim! 
Senior Staff Writer 

All that's necessary to draw 
attention to a certain sport these 
days is the mention of one Casey 
Martin. For those eight people in 
the Uniled States who don 't know 
about Martin 's court battles with 
the PGA Tour, Tiger Woods will do 
tine as a substitute. 

So it was to no one's surprise 
that qualifying for the 1998 UCSD 
men's golf team would be 
no easy task. Only the best 
golfers survived the fall 
and winter tryouts - pro-
ducing one of the most tal -
ented squads in years past.

"On our team, you are 
what you shoot," Triton 
Head Coach Mike Wydra 
explained. " I think it 's 
much better for chemistry 
that way. When you have a 
lot of competition, each 
guy has to [earn hi s spot] ." 

Currently, Darren Sul-
livan is in the No. I slot, 

coming off a fantastic week in 
which he was UCSD's medalist on 

iwo different occasions. Sullivan 
shot a 71 at Tustin Ranch Golf Club 
in the Tritons ' 299-328 romp over 
the Panthers of Chapman Universi-
ty last Wednesday. 

Feeling that his perfonnance 
should not be judgcd as a fluke, 
Sullivan came back to shoot a 32 
on thc back ninc at Canyon Crest 
Country Club in Riverside. This 
was en route to a 69 as UCSD held 
off Cal Baptist 292-298. 

The Tritons began the week at 
Annandale Country Club, defeat-

ing Occidental 297-327. 
The rest of UCSO's current 

lineup includes senior Jeremy Byrd 
at the No. 2 slOl followed by cap-
tain Greg Uberuaga, Matt Cassari-
no, Greg Johnson and Donahoe. 

For Wydra and company there is 
always one number that can gauge 
how well the squad is playing. To 
shoot 300 or below on any particu-
lar day will usually spell a win for 
UCSD in a dual meet, and su far 
this season, the Tritons are averag-
ing a 292 every time they tee off.

Chuck 
Wagon 
Jeff Bassett 
U.S.A. Hockey 
Proves Heartless 

For the first time in my life, I 
am almost embarrassed to be an 
American. Don 't get me wrong, 
I love thi s country, love what it 
stands for and feel privileged to 
ca ll myself a child of Uncle 
Sam. 

With the Olympics in 
progress as we speak, now is 
usually the time that my patriot-

• ic sentiments arc at their high-
est, my chest-thumping the 
loudest. I should he so full of 
passion for the good old red, 
white and blue that I can' t see 
straight, even sober. 

Forgive me, though, if my 
spirits have been more than a bit 
dampened by the performance 
of our men 's Olympic hockey 
team. If you mi ssed it. thi s 
squad, loaded for the first time 
with NHL players, was prompt-
ly eliminated in the first round 
of competition for the gold 
medal. 

That's right , the boys who 
were guaranteed at least the sil-
ver, possibly the gold, couldn't 
even make it past the first round. 

The play of these so-called 
professionals was humiliating, 
uninspired and downright 
awful. With well -established 
NHL stars such as Brett Hull , 
Jeremy Roenick and Chris Che-
lios lacing up their skates, one 
would expect the United States 
to return from Nagano with at 
least somelhing metallic . 

The team's effort was lack-
luster from the very first face-
ofr. Its pool-play sloryline was 
as follows : an' entirely unemo-
tional 4-2 loss to Sweden, a 
much-closer than necessary 5-3 
win over Belarus (who?) and a 
4-1 annihilation at the hands of 
our northern neighbors. 

SUl.:h a dismal record in pool 
play shou ld have caused all 
kinds of alarms to sound . 
Instead, our "best of the best" 
assured us that the first three 
games didn ' t mean anything, 
that they were merely adjusting 
to the bigger ice surface. 

In fact , the team was surpris-
ingly pleased with its 4- 1 shel-
lacking by Canada, informing 
us that, despite appearances, it 
was playing better and would be 
ju 't tine. 

They lied. In a performance 
which was the sorriest excuse 
for effort ever by a men 's 
Olympic hockey team, the Unit-
ed States was humiliated. 

Even worse than the actual 
performance wa), the realization 
that this team just didn't give a 
damn. Apparently unmotivated 
by the fact that they were our 
hand-picked ambassadors for 
the good old U.S. of A. , the men 
performed with zero emotion. 

Perhaps it's our fault. We

Triton Women Violate Vanguards 
TRIDENT: The Tritons used their respective weapons efficiently yesterday, easily dispatching sec. 
By Sean Rahimi 
Senior Staff Writer 

lL 's a facl. The UCSD women 's 
tennis team and weather patterns 
do not get along. Behold the 1992 
season, in which two 
weather pallerns - La 
Panch ita and El Pescado 
- threw UCSD's practice 
pallerns into fits and 
ruined its playoff run in 
late March. 

lege on Wednesday, UCSD. Head 
Coach Liz LaPlante and company 
summoned the Triton - demigod 
of the sea - to put a leash on EI 
Nino for a day. 

As a result, yesterday's 
match was completed on 
schedul e UCSD 
notched it s second win of 
the you ng season. a 7-2 
victory over the Van-
guards. 

Or how about the fierce 
winds of Hurricane Eddie 
that rol.:ked La Jolla 's TENNIS 

UCSD relied on strong 
si ngles play and a so lid 
doubles performance to 

breeze past the visilors from SCc. shores in 1989 - causing the ten-
ni s season to be canceled? 

Thus, when EI Nino threatened 
to cancel the Tritons ' practice 
schedule and subsequent contest 
against Southern California Col-

In the opening portion of the 
day, the Tritons grabbed two of 
three doubles' conte. ts. 

Freshman phcnom Kirsten 
Olsen and Maria Nguyen teamed 

up at the No. I slot, defeating Carin 
Crawford and Eden Looney, 8-4. 

SCC came back to win a tough 
pro set at the No.2 slot as Debbie 
Fulte and Michelle Tamplin edged 
OUl the UCSD landem of Jennifer 
Drimmer and Kelli Tsai in a tie-
hreaker, 9-7. 

LaPlante's squad salvaged the 
douhles portion and gai ned some 
momentum going into the singles 
portion of the day with a convinc-
ing 8-2 victory at the No.3 slot -
the team of Becky Jone and Robyn 
Kondrack over Amy Tate and 
Catherine White. 

In singles, Laura Brams, who 
found the recent rainy conditions 
adverse to practi cing her game, got 
her lirst taste of singles action in 
1998. Brams did not di sappoint -

she crushed White, 6-2, 6-0. 
"It 's kind of frustraling when 

you can' t practice," Brams said. " I 
was definitely ready to play today. I 
was a little nervous in the begin-
ning, but I had a lot of fun . We've 
really got a solid team thi s year and 
if we keep playing like we have, 
we' ll be fine ." 

In the best match of the day. 
Tsai - playing in the No. 3 slot -
had to go to three sets to take out 
Looney, 6-7, 6-2 and 6-4. Tsai ran 
down a number of the Vanguard 's 
hard groundstrokes and aggressive-
ly fini shed rallies from the base-
line. 

Jones and Kondrack took care 
of business at the No.4 and 5 slots, 
respectively - notching two more 
points to guarantee a UCSD win. 

UCSD Sends 35 Swimmers to Nationals 
CONFERENCE: The Triton men and women both took fifth place over the weekend in Long Beach 
By Jake Gordon 
Staff Writer 

Over this long President's Day 
weekend, there was a place where 
people witnessed intense 
competition between well-

t~ained competitors from 
all over. No, I'm not talk-
ing about Nagano, Japan, 
but rather Long Beach, 
California - site of the 
Pacific Coast Swim Con-
ference Championships. 

Both the UCSD men 's 
and women's team participated in 
the PCSC Championships last 
Thursday through Saturday and 
swam valiantly. 

The Tritons were rewarded for 
their hard work in Long Beach with 
fifth -place linishes for both teams 
and, more importantly, many quali-

fied for next month 's Divi-
sion III National Champi-
onships in SI. Louis. 

For this important 
meet, UCSD shaved the 
members of its team who 
had not yet qualified for 
Nationals, mostly lhe 
younger swimmers. 

On the women 's side, 
Sophomore Ken Wilson had unfor-
gettable conference finals. swim-
ming lifetime bests in both the 500-
yard freestyle and the 1650-yard 

free . She aUlomatically qualified 
for Nationals in both events. 

Fellow sophomore Vinessa Tjoa 
also swam a lifetime best in the 
200-yard free . 

In the 50-yard free, freshman 
Sharon Smith swam the fifth-best 
UCSD time ever. 

Both Tjoa and Smith received 
NCAA consideration for Nationals. 
The reliable relay team of Smith, 
Shawna Caballero, Taylor Mitchell 
and Amanda Gurnee also received 
NCAA consideration for their 400-
yard free relay. 

Including conference, the Triton 
women's team has qualified 18 
swimmers for the National Cham-

pionships which will begin on Mar. 
12. 

On the men's side, junior trans-
fer Marc Latronica won the 100-
yard butterfly unshaved and fresh -
men Greg Scott and Gary Gray fin -
i hed second and third respectively 
in the 200-yard breaststroke. Both 
ScOll and Gray received NCAA 
consideration for their efforts. 

Freshman Alex Nicoll also 
received NCAA con ideration for 
his great races in the 100- and 200-
yard backstroke. In its quest for 
Nationals, the men's team has qual-
ified 17 swimmers. The men's 
Division III Championships begin 
on March 19.
