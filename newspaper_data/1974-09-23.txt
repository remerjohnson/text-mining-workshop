University Exchange Program 
With U. of Chile Criticized 

by Malcolm Smith 
The Universi ty of Cal ifornia's 

exchange program with the 
University of Chi le has come 
under attack because of con-
cern that " it would be very 
difficult for the University (of 
Cal ifornia) to feel it was dealing 
with a free university when a 
general has been made 
di rector." 

The Mandeville Center 

So said former UC President 
Clark K rr at an appearance at 
Santa Barbara last spring, and 
that concern has spread to, and 
been echoed by, student groups, 
the Academic Senates of San 
Diego and Berkeley , and 
members of the UC ad -
ministration . "We are trying to 
figure out whether we can 
conti nue to work with the new 
regi me or not;' UCLA Chancellor 
Charles E. Young to ld the LA 
Times last Tuesday. Young wi ll 
vis it Chile this week to assessthe 
situation there, and an an-
nouncement is expected in mid-
October regarding UC's future 
pol icy in deal ing with the 
Chilean regime. 

UCSD Enrollment Up 
1000 As 4th Opens 

UCSD greets its tenth fall 
quarter today with a projected 
enrollment of nearly 9,000, the 
largest in its history, and the 
opening of its new Fourth 
College. 

In addition, construction on 
the first Third College Academic 
Unit has begun, while the Health 
Center '"and the Mandeville arts 
center near completion . 

Enrollment 

Projected enrollment at UCSD 
for the 1974-75 school year has 
jumped nearly 1000 to a total of 
8,862 students . A major portion of 
this increase is a result of the 
opening of Fourth , whose 
curricular emphasis will be on 
career planning. 

Third College grew by 249 
students to a total of 800, wh ile 
Muir increased its enrollment by 
157 to 3112. Revelle College plans 
a drop in enrollment of 137 
students to a total of 2524. The 
Medical School increased its 
student body to 752 from a 1973-
74 total of 568. Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography will show a 
slight increase to 192 students, six 
more than last year. 

Buildinl 

Groundbreaking ceremonies 
fo r th e new Ttiird College 
bui ldings were held August 20. 
The ceremony took place at what 
wi ll be the main entrance to the 
college, adjacent to old Highway 
101 and west of the Central 
Library . 

Total cost for Academic Unit I, 
including four buildings, utilities, 
landscaping and paving is set at 
$7 million . Campus planners hope 
the unit will be ready for use by 
the fall quarter of .1975. 

In an address following the 
ceremony, Third Provost Joseph 
Watson pledged to uphold the 
philosophies through which Third

breaking of this ground and the 
construction of these permanent 
facilities serve both to crown our 
past endeavors and to fort ify and 
redouble our efforts on behalf of 
the principles and objectives of 
this college, for in the tradition of 
land Grant colleges and 
universities, Third College 
recognizes both an educational 
and a social responsibility . A 
responsibility to provide an 
excellent education in the liberal 
arts and scjences and a 
responsibility to make the op-

effectively available to all people,

The exchange program has 
" brought about very significant 
changes" in .the academ ic 
quality of the University of 
Chile, according to Chancellor 
Young. In 1976 Chile's first 
graduate program in forestry 
will be started by Chilean 
students who recieved their Ph-

Dye Appointed to Dean 
of Students Post at 3rd 

Dr. Raymond E. Dye, from the State Universi ty of New York at 
Buffalo, has been named Dean of Students for the Third College. 

Dye, who will serve as the chief administrative officer for student 
affairs at the college, will begin his duties this quarter at UCSD. 

At SUNY, Dye has also- served as area coordinator .for student 
affairs. He served for six months as Assistant to the Vice President for 
Student Affairs during the 1972· academic year, in addition to teaching 
in the psychology and health science departments. 

'74 Election 
Draws Yawns 
From Voters 

by James c. Soto 
Though active campaigning 

has been intensive for the 1974 
California General Election, 
voter and media interest has 
been minimal as election 
politics in California has been 
submerged by the attention 
given to the new Ford 
Presidency. 

What little attention that 
there has been has been given to 
the Gubernatorial race. The 
latest Field Poll gives 
Democratic candidate 
Secretary of State Edmud G. 
Brown Jr. a moderate ad-
vantaae over Republican State 
Controller Houston ' Flournoy. 

Both candidates have been in 
nearly every part of the State 

. several times. Brown was in San

Dye, born in 19'37, received a BA 
from Harris College in St. Louis in 
1961 . He received his MS in 
Counseling . and Student per-
sonnel from Southern Ill inois 
University two years later and a 
Ph .D in higher education from 
SUNY at Buffalo in 1970. 

"Positive" 
Dye said his current v iew of 

Third College is "overwhelmingly 
positive . Unfortunately, th e 
image a few people have outside 
the college is negative. I am 
convinced that this is a result of 
their not being completely in-
formed . For example, Third 
College presently has a very 
strong curriculum. The Provost, 
faculty, staff and students are 
working dilligently to further 
strengthen the curriculum and 
create involvement in the San 
Diego communtiy." 

Dye said he hopes to " focus on 
pulling the College Deans' staff 
together and to have it operate as 
a cohesive unit. Further, I am very 
much . concerned with providing 
the kinds of training for the staH 
that will help them grow and 
develop so that they will be in a 
position to offer a better quality 
of service and aid to the 
students." 

The Dean also commented that 
he will be concerned, " as all 
deans must be," with " the

UC Budget Request Up 16" 
The Regents of the University of California have requested a 5588 

million budget for the 1975-76 academic year, a figure 15 per cent 
more than the present budget. 

C. o'McCorlde, U.c. Vice President, made the announcement of the 
requested budget increase last Thursday at the Regents meeting. 
McCorkle said the budget was constructed with "a sense of some 
phased recovery." Observers of the Regents believe that the budget 
increase would be accepted by either of the gubernational hopefuls, 
Houston Flournoy or Jerry Brown.

Scripps' Dayton Honored 
A Scripps Inst itution of Oceanography faculty member has received 

the Ecological Society of America's (ECA) 1974 Mercer Award as the 
young man who, in the previous two years, has published "an out-
standing paper in ecology." 

He is Dr. Paul K. Dayton , 33, assistant profesmr of oceanography, 
who received a check in the amount of S100 and a certificate, both 
presented on the society's behalf by Dr. William A. Nierenberg, 
director of Scripps. 

The society said Dr. Dayton received the Mercer Award for his 
paper, "Competition, distrubance, and commun ity organ ization . The 
provision and subsequent utilization of spac.e in a rocky intertidal 
community." The paper appeared 10 Ecological Monographs. 

The principal contribution of this raper and others by Dr Dayton is 
t~e empha'sis on experimental verifi cation of speCific hypotheses 
regarding the functional roles that part icular species exert on the 
organization of ecological communities. 

Dr. Dayton says that emerging from these stud ies is the realization 
that certain species have disproportionately important roles in the 
communities . 

He be lieves this knowledge can simplify the evolutionary un-
derstanding and rational management of these communit ies. 

Dr. Dayton 's investigations have included nearshore commun ity 
eco logy, including benthic communities in Antarctica, wh ich he 
stud ied on several expeditions. His current emphasis is on Cal iforn ia 
kelp commun it ies. 

Shop Talk 
This year the Triton Times will 

appear three times a week, 
instead of the two issues per 
week that we have publ ished in 
the past. In doing so, we hope to 
better serve the campus through 
more up-to-date coverage of 
news, sports, and arts events. In 
addition, the increased space 
w i ll allow more in-depth 
coverage ofthe campus and wi ll 
allow us to increase the number 
of our contributors. 

In order to make the paper 
work we need help--YOUR 
HELP. We need newswriters, 
sports writers, photographers, 
ad salesmen, copyreaders, and, 
above all" interested students, 
faculty and ~taff to SUbmit 
letters, opinion s, articles, 
cartoons, and to let us know 
what YOU think of the campus, 
the worlo, or whatever. The 
Triton Times will welcome 
comments on itself- let us know 
what you th ink, and maybe we 
will improve. Say nothina and 
we won't.

My one moment of 
enlighteoment this summer came 
when I htee movers-men of the 
road-brought my grandmother's 
worldlV goods to our house in 
Phoenix following her move out 
west . It was in the four-hour 
transfer of old Sinatra records, 
rocking chairs, and boxes of by John H. Tayiot 

• housewares that I carne to respect 
them as the most sophisticated men I had ever met. 

Initially, they moved slowly, and grumbled. They appeared to feel 
their task would be impossible, the prinCiple difficulty being an or-
nately carved, 100-year-old pump or&~ (with carpeted pedals and 
stops like "Vox Humana, 8"') which the movers claimed would require 
the strength of SOO men to push up the steep driveway. It was, 
however, from their persistent and barely audible grumblina that they 
eventually acquired the strength to do it themselves. 

When they first entered the house, prior to moving the furn i ture, 
each took to his own station : one carefully unfurled a poster (from my 
prep school years) of an unclad, Pre-Awareness Jane Fonda and smiled; 
another settled in a corner with a copy of "The Encyclopedia of Music 
and Musicians" (under, I presumed, 'Greviously Heavy and Antiquated 
Organs'); the third, Charlie, who was in charge of the operation, began 
to grumble about the personal check that was handed to Ii im . He didn't 
trust it at all, and threatened to leave immediately, taking my grand-
mother's organ with him. 

He must have realized how stupid it would be to give him a bad 
check-we woul~ have to hire him back again to move the 3000 pounds 
of stuff to wherever we would hide from Charlie and the bank. He 
eventually allowed some vice-president of the Bank of America to 
convince him he wasn't being nipped. Only because, I'm sure, the 
president wasn't available . 

The transfer began, and the grumbling gave way to an 41ttitude of 
genuine professionalism. They were accustomed to lifting and tran-
sporting, with surprising grace and ease, weights most people would 
never have to deal with . The loaded van was a marvel-ob;ects were 
packed together very intricately, allowing both for efficent use of 
space and for protection of the more fragile items . 

In their work, the men showed the kind of consideration that would 
have to grow from countless encounters with people who had iust 
moved, for instance, from their home towns, or whose families had 
been disrupted by divorce or death . Moving, for whatever reason, pulls 
people to a psychological edge, and to effectively do their job the 
movers had developed a sophisticated awareness of human nature . 
They dealt with me through a set of sympathetic and positive 
assumptions about Youth that were at least quite complementary, if 
not always accurate. (One called me 'John-boy', which had a Ten-
nessee Williams flavor I liked .) 

They also understood objects . They knew, for instance, about organs 
and pianos from all over the country ("Hey Charlie, remember that 
grand from Chicago to Miami? What a bitch"), though probably more 
according to dimension than , say, tone. 

When they left, I noticed that the furniture filled the house up with a 
sme ll I had always associated with my grandmother's house in 
Michigan : images came of the Mackinaw Bridge, the deep blue water 
of the Straits, and the endless forest behind her house . (For some 
reason , I've never seen a tulip anywhere except in her garden .) 

All these images for a moment overpowered those of the brown 
Arizona desert that surrounded me, and gave me respect I will always 
have for men who can transport a life and a set of memories 3000 miles 
intact . 

Extension Enrollment 
The procedure for enrolling in free Extension courses for fall 

quarter differs according to colleges. 

Revelle and Muir. undergraduates are eligible, wi th the . 
approval of their Provost's Office , to take University Extension 
courses at no cost. First rriority for the limited number of 
complimentary spaces wil go to those students enrolling in 
Extension ,classes approved for undergraduate credit. 

The date and time for enrolling in credit courses is 10 a .m. to 
1 p .m . on Wednesday, in the Lounge of the International Center, 
on Matthews Campus. 

It there are remaining complimentary spaces after enrolJment 
for credit courses, students may enroll in other Extension. 
classes on Friday between 1 and 4:30 p.m. in the Extension 
Classroom Building 103·,\ , Matthews Campus. 

Third and Fourth College students should consult respective 
ProVOStS' Offices to obtain information on complimemary 
enrollment in Extension classes. 

'J(aduate students can obtain petitions for complimentary 
en :oIlment, in the Office of Graduate Studies and Research.

1st Student Coop Meeting Tonight 
A new UCSD KOvernmental 

entity, the .student Cooperative, 
will hold its first meeting of the 
school year tonight at 6 :30 in the 
lounge of the student center . 

The Coop, conceived last year 
by a Model-Building Committee 
charged with finding an alt~r­
native to the Undergraduate 
Student Council (TUSCI. is 
patterned loosely after the New 
England town meeting concept of 
participatory democracy .. Any 
student becomes. a voting 
member of the Coop after at-
tending three meetings. 

TUSC was set up by the 
Chancellor to replace the 
Associated Students, which 'vas 
abolished by a student 
referendum at the end of the 
1971-72 school year. Since its 
inception, participation in TUSC 
by students has been light, 
although it controls a significant 
Portion of student funds for 
allocation . The formulators of the 
Coop plan hope the new system 
will provide a more accessable 
means of participation for 
students. 

The principal activities of would be checks preventing' any

organizations, have been tran-
sfered to the Coop Budget 
Committee, which comprises one 
member from each of the four 
colleges. All actions of the 
committee will be in the form of 
recommendations, however, 
subject to the approval of the 
Coop as a whole. 

The founders of the Coop 
admit their system depends on 
interests to stimulate par-
ticipation, but the Model-
Building committee's report

follows: 

"The Earth does not belong to 
man ; man belongs to the Earth ." 
These words of an old Indian 
chief in rebuke of the Federal 
Government trying to buy his 
land also express, a century later, 
the theme of the first world's fair 
dedicated to the environment. 

Expo 74 at Spokane, 
Washington represents the 
combined efforts of ten nations, a 
half-dozen western states and 
Canadian provinces, and many 
industrial , commercial and 
cultural groups to encourage 
wo rld -wide environmental 
protect ion . 

Ex po 74 is taking place on a 
hu ndred acre site in the center of 
pokane from May 4 to Nov 3 

wi th a projected 4.8 m ill ion

The size and location of Expo 
74 ha s it s advantages, however, 
especially for the city of Spokane. 
Three years ago, Spokane was 
your regular polluted , congested, 
ugly c ity with not much going for 
it. 

Today , after slums were 
cleared, land salvaged, sewage 

treatment plants improved even 
closing a paper mill and installing 
computer traffic control, tfie city 
appears to be reborn and 
beautiful. The total investment 
came over S78 million but is 
expected to pump about S700 
million 'into the city's economy 
over the next decade . When the 
fair ends, Spokane will be left 
with a beautiful new Opera 
House and Convention Center 
situated in its downtown river-
front park with a spectacular view 
of the Spokane River Falls. 

As with all world expositions 
the large volume of people 
flooding the fairgrounds creates a 
serious security problem that is 
usually met with a large and 
efficient security force . Guns and 
knives are checked after entering 
the fair grounds while sur-
priSingly , people without shirt s or 
shoes 'are not ' ev!!n permitted 
e ntry . 

On s urit y sc heme out-foxed 
the tou ri sts that plagued the Fa ir 
Ad m inist rati o n Building looking 
for restrooms . It was simply 
necessa ry to r~pl ace th e sign on 
the women's room door with one 
that read " Dark Room " and the 
one on the men's room door with 
"Next ch du led Use." 

The dasta rdly schem e worked 
with only minor confusio n. Why 
they went to the trouble of 
puttin g a combination lock on 
the women 's room door, even the 
employees can 't figure out. To 
add injury to insult , women 
employees were not given the 
combination until sufficien t 
pressure built up to demand 
action and provide them relief. 

Other highlights of the Fair 
include the Soviet Pavilion and 
the U.S. Pavilion . The Russians 
came out in full force trying 
desperately to tone down their 
nationalism, typical of world's 
fairs, and concentrate on the 
remarkable advances being made 
in environmental protection in 
their country. Also interesting is 
their history of science retold and 
a profound theory of the 
Biosphere by Vernadsky (copy on 
reserve in Humanities Library.) 

For all their grace and charm, 
the hand-picked pavilion staff are 
very strict not to discuss anything

controversia I. It is rumored that 
visitors wearing "Save Israel" 
buttons or tee-shirts were no even 
permitted entry, and if asking 
delicate questions, visitors were 
hauled away by security guards . 

The U.S. Pavilion boasted an 
8()().seat theater with a twenty 
minute film focusing on the 
earth 's natural beauty and how 
global pollution threatens it. The 
screen, however, was the treat 
being a mamoth 65 ft. ,tall and 95

possibly the largest screen in the

system by which we deposit and 
withdraw information in our 
memory bank has been 
developed in UCLA's Brain 
Research Institute. 

A research team headed by 
Dr. W . Ross Adey has evidence 
that weak electrical fields within 
the central nervous system-the 
brain waves represented by the 
elctroencephalogram (EEG)-are 
an important communications 
link through which the brain 
transacts information. 

The jiggly lines of the HC, 
which are the record of the 
brain's overall electrical ac-
tivity, have long been used to 
diagnose neurological disorders 
and in the study of brain func-
tion . In recent years 
sophisticated computer 
techniques have enabled 
scientists ' .to identify HC 

'. 

correlates of decision-making 
and various states of in-
formation processing. Yet the 
fundamental nature of the EEG is 
still a puzzle. No one has been 
able to assign it a proper 
physiological role in brain 
transactions. 

In recent years scientists have 
begun to think of the EEG as a 
sort of "whispering together" of 
neurons. With the concept in 
mind Dr. Adey and his group 
have developed a model of 
information processing 
featuring the EEG. Their findings 
Indicate that these weak in-
ternal brain electric fields can 
alter responses of brain cells, 
even though they are more than 
10,000 times less than the 
electric gradient that "drives" a 
brain cell in firing an impulse. 
The brain appears to use both 
high and low level energy

release in at least two different 
signaling system. 

Brain waves surge through the 
elltracellular spaces, a series of 
tiny streets between brain ,ells, 
where they brush tiers of large 
molecules on the surface of 
neurons. The altered neuronal 
membrane surface amplifies 
these weak signals and appears 
to change surface molecular 
arrangements 'and the ell-
citabtlity of individual neurons. 

There is then a release of 
calcium and transmitter sub-
stance in amounts that can 
regulate the firing of brief 
Impulses by the nerve cells. The 
latter has hitherto been con-
sidered the sole means of 
communication between nerve 
cells . But the new findings 
indicate that low level com-
m unication by brain cells 
"whispering together" (by slow 
electric waves, which they also 
make) may be very important, 
since the waves were shown to 
release large amounts of 
transmitter substance. 

In addition to the handling of 
information, this series of events 
may be involved in the storage 
and recaN of information in the 
brain . Memory may be stored in 
the molecular tiers on neuronal 
surfaces. Altered arrangement 
of these molecules whict. sense 
and respond to patterned EEC 
activity may reflect in formation 
processing. 

Transactions in the nervous 
system have traditionally been 
viewed as a matter of pulse-
coded signals carried along 
nerve fibers and across neuronal 
junctions (synapses) through the 
"wiring diagram" of the brain . 
These are the circuits by which 
information is carried from 
sense organs to the brain . The 
HG paths may represent an 
additional system by which this 
information is processed with 
the brain, Dr , Adey believes, 
and do not use a "wiring 
diagram " in altering the 
behavior of many brain cells at 
the same time.

Brain Constructs Vision 
In/ine - A popular misconception is that the mind sees the 

world like a photograph. Instead, visual brain mechanisms create 
unellpected illusions. Some of these illusions are described by Dr. 
John I. Yellott, Jr., UC Irvine associate professor of psychology 

An experimental and mathematical phychologlst, Dr. Yellott 
says most people believe the ideas about vision described in 1638 
by the French philosopher Descartes. He assumed the mind 
directly perceives the optical image formed on the back wall of 
the eye. 

Yellott 's demonstrations, however, show that images actually 
become distorted. 

Ih one demonstration, an overlay pattern of red and green 
stripes is projected on a screen and viewed through glasses in 
which one lens is green and the other red , With both eye~, the 
subject sees a red and green mosaic , Separately, one eye sees 
only red stripes and the other sees green . The neural process or 
"mind's eye" selects from this mosaic, each gaining dominance 
in turn, and images may be a combination from both eyes. 

Another demonstration illustrates the after-illusion of staring 
steadily at the center of a rotatina spiral for 30 seconds. The 
subject is requested to look quickly away at a picture on the wall. 
The picture seems to expand and loom toward the viewer when 
the spiral rotation was inward. T~ imaae of the picture contracts 
when the spiral rotated outward. 

By shutting one eye while viewing the spiral, then viewing the 
picture on the wall with the other eye, the subject reports that a 
transfer of the illusion takes place. 

"The picture of the world that we see in our mind's eye is 
always a highly edited version of the way things used to look. It is 
the brain, not the eye, which constructs our vision of the world " 
Yellott concludes. '

Nature Corner 
by Malcolm Smith 

Have you ever stepped on a 
cactus? Done properly, it can 
become a trl1ly educational 
experience. 

Naturally, there is a right and 
wrong way to approach the 
subject. In order to get the most 
from your experience, just 
follow the simple method 
detailed below. 

First, get your feet good and 
wet: this can be accomplished 
by soaking your feet for half an 
hour, watering the garden 
barefoot, etc. This softens up 
the skin, making your foot more 
receptive to the experience. 

Procure a medium sized, 
healthy cactus ' a prickly pear 
works especially well. Select a 
well endowed section, place it 
on the ground, and step down 
hard. You should be able to 
cover about half your foot, more 
if you have a large cactus or a 
small foot . 

Upon examination of your 
foot, you will discover the 
wonderful deSign of nature 
embodied in this hardy plant. A 
cactus has three kinds of spines; 
big ones you can see, little ones 
you can see, and, of course, 
little ones you can't see. 

The large spines are easy to 
remove, but the other, smaller 
ones will give you several hours 
of amusement before you dare 
put weight on your foot. 

You will be amazed at the 
number of invisible spines that 
have no existence except for the 

occasional jab of pain as you 
walk. A clear memory of your 
experience will live in your 
mind, and your foot, for several 
weeks. 

Ah, yes . Many are the 
wonders of nature. You too can 

unravel her secrets by simple 
eKperiments such as this, all of 
which can be performed in your 
own backyard . 

Be with us next week as we 
explore the wonders of Scor-
pions. 

Announcements 
The Ice Skating, Snow Ski and Modern Dance clubs will hold 

their first meetings of the year on Tues. Sept . 24 in the Rec. Gym 
Conference Room. The Ice Skating Club will meet at 6 pm, the 
Snow Skiing Club will meet at 7 pm, and the Modern Dance Club 
will meet at 8 pm. If you have any questions with regards to these 
clubs, or any other clubs, contact the Recreation Office. 

Intercollegiate Sports begin almost immediately, and with 
that, there comes the usual pre-season rush of team meetings. 
The majority of these meetinls Will fall in the first couple weeks 
of the school year . If you are interested in trying out for one of 
the followinll teams be sure to attend the team organizational 
meeting.

Roots would Hke 
your next walk to class 

to be a part of your education. 
We'd like you to learn a little 
about your feet-why they 
work as they do, and why they 
don't always work as they 
should. Did you know, for ex-
ample, that if instead of bang-
ing your soles about on cam-
pus concrete, you were to go 
strolling barefoot on a beach,

two things would result. First, 
your grades would drop. 
Secondly, your heel would 
make the deepest part of your 
footprint. This is because na-
ture intended your heel to be 
the lowest part of your body. 
So in Roots your heel sits in the

lowest part of the shoe. You 
immediately stand straighter. 
And when you walk, you use 
leg muscles you probably 
haven't used for years. All of 
this takes the load off other 
parts of your body, parts which 
all too often get overworked 
from incorrect posture. 

) 

If you're wondering whether all 
this can happen in good-
looking well-made footwear, 
tryon a pair for yourself. One 
look should persuade you that 
Roots is much more than a 
beautiful idea. 
It's also a very attractive shoe.

The Baechae will be presented September 27 at Noon on the 
steps of the Gym by the Campus Porgram Board and the In-
tercampus Cultural Exchange Program. 

The cast was formed through a workshop held in Berkeley last 
summer. Performers are represented from 6 U.c. campuses. The 
play is directed by Zouzou Nicoloudi, principal choreographer of 
the Creek National Theatre, Athens. Mme Nicoloudi has ap-
peared twice with her own company on the U.c. Berkeley 
campus, with outstanding critical and audience acclaim. During 
her career, she has presented Greek dance and drama all over 
Europe and the United States, and has collaborated with some 
immortal artists of the century, such as Harald Kreutzberg and 
Carl Orff . 

The Bacchae was written by Euripides between 408 and 406 
B.C., and deals with the tragic punishment of Pen-
theus , the king of Thebes, who imprisons Dionysus and is torn to 
piec$!s by his own mother during a Baccanalian orgy. Mme 
Niroloudi is using William Arrowsmith's modern translation of 
f uri[lf's and it is used here without signifi cant modification .

join the jazz ensembles or Gospel 
Choi, contact Professor lytle next 
week throulh the music office or 
in Mandeville Center, 8-138. 

Mondays at 7 :30 pm, 
preferably fifteen minutes before, 
is the time to audition for the la 
JoUa Civic/University Symphony 
in the basement of the Man-
deville Center. The Orchestra 
consists of about 80 mUSicians, 
half from the University, half 
from the community. This year 
there will be four major concerts 
beginning in November with 
programs featuring works by Jves, 
Shostakovich, Tschaikovsky, 
Bach, Berlioz, among others, and 
noted soloists . Everyone is 
welcome to audition . 

The UCSD Drama Dept. and 
UCSD Theatre are Bettina an 
early start in aU phases of 
dramatic involvement. The first 
week of classes will see not only 
a general orientation for in-
terested students, but auditions 
for the first production of the 
upcoming UCSD Theatre 
season, and performances of an 
outstanding production of 
Samuel Beckett's Endpme. 

Endpme is a play dealing 
primarily with two characters, 
Hamm and Clov, in a master-
servant relationship . It concerns 
man 's painful,. perplexed; 
frantic, and even comic con-
front.tion with death . 

"The play is usually treated as 
a somber philosophical exercise, 
full of dark broodings," Addison 
said. " In our production we are 
focusing on the more im-
mediate, buf no less meaningful 
human relationships and are 

seeking meaning in behavior 
that might be found in such 
places as a prison, an asylum, a 
concentration camp or a ter-
minal ward-all the places where 
humans do, in fact , play out 
their endgames." 

For further information ca ll ext. 
3230 or ext . 3229. 

This space provided by the 
BUlinell ~rtment of the 
Triton Tim". Incidently we 
need one work-ltudy secretary 
lind a few more ules persons. 
All who are interested in the 

above should come by the 
office ilnd see Mike or check the 
listing at your nearest 5.E.0 . 

UCSO's Enpme Project is a 
faculty-student production 
which will be presented at the 
UCSD Theatre on September 
25th through 28th, with per-
formances nightly at 8 :00 p.m. 
and a special night-owl per-
formance at 11 :00 p .m. on 
closing Saturday . 

Dr . Michael Addison , 
Associate Professor of Drama at 
UC San Diego and director of 
the project, considers this a 
unique production, as it brings 
together drama faculty 
member.s from two of the UC 
campuses, giving them an 
opportunity to work and 'study 
together , something almost 
impossible during the academic 
year. 

The cast of Endaame includes 
Dr. Arthur Wagner, chairman of 
the Drama Department at UCSD 
(who delighted audiences last 
year as Orgon in the UCSD 
Theatre production ofT artuffe.l 
John Harrop, Assistant Professor 
of Drama on the Santa Barbara 
Campus, and two UCSD 
students, Richard Revellix and 
Robyn Hunt. 

"Our production," he said, 
"will certainly be influenced by 
the literary and philosophical 
richness of Beckett's art . But the 
sociological and psychological 
research wi II also have an 
important impact on the final 
theatrical form ." 

Tickets are S 1.00 for students, 
(52.00 for the general public) 
seating is limited in the Intimate 
200 seat theatre, so tickets will 
sell au fast Tickets are available 
in the Drama office at 203 Me

becoming part of the UCSD 
Theatre season of productions,a

Club, Children's Theatre Players, 
Street Theatre (Comedia 
dell' Arte), etc

Pale 9 Triton Times SepteMber 23, 197. 



And 50 the students arrive: the freshmen, bright eyed and 
somewhat ~wed by their arrival at "The University," older 
students, hardened by bureaucratic realities, glassy eyed and 
cynical. The University sits like a great pregnant cow, awaiting 
birth of a changeling child . 

For what really changes? The bright eyes of freshmen fade 
under the glare of study lamps, their awe of the university gives 
way to cynicism and the lure of the beach . The great machine 
clanks laboriously into gear and moves, bulldozer-like, across the 
minds of men: another crop of humankind has arrived to be 
sacraficed upon the alter of Science. 

And yet the picture is not entirely bleak . From under the glare 
of lamps emerge doctors; the lure of the beach is transformed 
into a lifelong interest in Oceanography. The codification of 
knowledge reveals gaps, the sloution to one mystery reveals a 
score of others. 

Nothing changes, really, for men are drawn to mystery, to 
problems unsolved, and, perhaps, insoluble . The alchemist 
has moved from a deserted house to an antiseptic lab, but the 
driving force is still the same . 

Remember this when you confront the petty bureaucrat en-
sconced behind the fortified wall of his desk and procedure 
manuals, remember thi s when you sit in the back of an over-
crowded classroom and strain your ear to catch the dull lecture, 
remember thi s when you study late into the night for an exam, 
cramm ing for the morrow's regurgitation . For you will b e con-
fronting the eterna l question, the mystery of t he university's 
existen e. 

OPENING UP THE TRITON TIMES 
by Charles Heimler, 
Editori<1ll Director 

Today's edition l of the Triton Times hopefully marks the 
beginnirw of a new period in the history of UCSD's largest print 
medium. 

The last two years have seen the demise of the Triton Times 
into at best an insensitive polarizer of various communities 
within the university and at worst a disorganized advertising 
supplement to the most widely read section of the TT, the 
classified ads. 

The flavor of the Triton Times these last years has reflected the 
flavor of the·times. 

Somewhere in the early seventies the wave of newfound 
political social and civil rights c rested and broke into the 
whitewater of the Watergate era . 

Intense scrutiny of the university experience receeded and 
turned into a unquestioning acceptance of anyth ing needed to 
maintain a sufficiently high grade point average to get into a 
professional or graduate school. 

After five years the issues of the sixties-the dehumanization 
levied by society, and the university as one of its most respected 
goodies , and the locked up, barricaded, closed nature of the 
American political process still remain , if only in the minds of a 
handful of the holdovers. 

Students still sit in lecture halls overcrowded despite holding a 
" teachable" 350 students . The ivory tower is still i ntact 
protecting the fruitfly experimenters from the realiti es of the 
outside world . 

And after all , the last installment of the Watergate serial 
demonstrated the back-scratchir ' o f those in the system at the 
expense of those out of the system is the rule, not the exception, 
of the American political process . 

No handful of edi tors and writers o n a campus newspaper can 
reverse the trends of the United States ' cab ride down the 
Madison Avenue of the seventies . 

But hopefully, we can ascribe to the values associated with 
another decade- the universal human values, in cludi ng lovE' and 
respect for each oth er, so often lost in the quest for lob

continued from col. 1 
placement-and help set the pendulum back in' motion . 

The opinion pages of the Triton Times once stocked with sad 
attempts at satire ending in racial slurs and bad pornography will 
now be opened up to free discussion of university life within the 
world we all live in . 

And it 'will be opened up to everyone in the university com-
munity . We encourage readers to submit articles, letters, car-
toons, and to drop in and say what they think about the opinion 
pages. 

Bring your work, typed on a 65 space line to the TT office, 
Lower Blake Hall. 

For too long the Triton Times h as been a small clique within 
the university-and it showed. We're going to try to make Triton 
Times a reflection of the whole community.

tate Races Slow 
cor""'"" from pase 1 

Flournoy a possible 
boost to his campaian when it 
was anno'mced Friday that 
President Ford would make 
some campaign appearances for 
Flournoy in late October. 

Principle attention in the 
campaign has centered around 
whether Flournoy and Brown 
will debate the issues. Earlier in 
the campaign Brown and 
Flournoy had agreed to debate 
often . There was one public 
debate in Chico before Brown's 
office said it would be unable to 
include anymore debates in its 
schedule. 

Other important statewide 
races include the race for Lt . 
Governor where State Senator 
Mervyn Dymally is challenged 
by his Rupublican collegue 
State Senator John Harmer. Last 
Friday Mervyn Dymally said his 
chan~s and the chances of his 
opponent for election rest with 
the fortunes of their guber-
natorial candidates. 
. U.S. Senator Alan Cranston is 

being challenged for reelection 
by Republ ican State Senator H . 
L. Richardson. Although not 
mu ch interest has been 
generated by this contest it 
should be a classic one between 
the liberal Cranston and the 
conservitive Richardson. 

In local races, San 
County w i ll elect 
Congressmen , three 

Diego 
three 
State 

Senators, and five assem-
blymen . In non-partisan races 
the county wi II elect two 
Supervisors. 

In the 43rd Congressional 
District (UCSO's district) Rep. 
Clair Burgener faces Democratic 
challenger Bill Bandes. Though 
Bandes was popurar in the 
UCSD precints in the June 
primary, Burgerner is a popular 
representitive in a heavily 
Republican district. 

Most attention in San Diego 
has been given to the 41st 
Congressional District where 
Congressman Bob Wilson faces 
the toughest race of his 20 year 
career in the house against 
Colleen O 'Conner. O'Conner. 
the sister of San Diego Council-
woman Maureen O 'Conner, has 
waged a hardhitting campaign 
against Wilson, forcing the 
incumbent to campaign 
seriously for the first time in 
many years. 

The other San Diego races are 
expected to be won by in-
cumbents, but there may be 
some upsets. In th e 77th 
Assembly District incumbent 
Democrat Bob Wilson again will 
have a strong Republican 
challenger in Mike Bollman . In 
the South Bay, incumbent Jim 
Bear will defend his post on the 
County Board of Supervisors 
against San Diego Councilman 
Jim Bates. 

'Chile Exchange Criticizedl 
Continued from Pale 1 

University of California shOUld 
deny the opportunity for 
Questioning whether the 

Chil~an students and faculty to 
"benefit from the exchange 
program," and also whether the 
University of Chile has any less· 
academ iC freedom now than it 

did under Allende. " We took the 
position then that we had to 
stay out of politics" Young said, 
"That position was all right then, 
when it was a ' Ieft-wing 
government, but now (some 
people say) its not acceptable 
because a right wing govern-
ment is involved." . 

Expo 
Continued from '.e 3 

U.S. over a five-year period as 
mapped by satellite. These vivid 
and colorful photographs. are 
available to the public. 

One of the most unusual 
exhibits and a regular at world's 
fairs ;s the Czechoslovakian Ki~o 
Automat or Decision Theater, 
where the audience actually 
detertnines the course of action 
of the show. Consequently each 
performance is different and 
delightfully amusing. 

In general, world's fairs are 
known for their spectacular 
entertainment and Spokane was 
not to be out 'done. Big-name 
entertainment scheduled at Expo 
74 includes Bob Hope, Jack 
Benny, Liberace, Ella Fitzgerald, 
Kris Kristofferson, Chicago, Grand 
Funk, the Carpenters, Bill Cosby, 
and Mormon Tabernacle Choir, 
just to name a few. Various 
philharmonic symphonies and 
international dance companies 
also provide unusual variety. As if 
this were not enough, nearly 
13,000 non-paid entertainers 
provide almost constant per-
forman ces. Even the Don McLeod 
Mime Theater performs daily to 
delightthe passing audiences and 
unsuspecting subjects for 
mimicry . 

All in all , Expo '74 makes an 
enjoyable and worthwhile 
vacation trip, without the agony 
of overwhelming crowd. Eight 
hour l ines or exhaustingly long 
walks around the fairgrounds are 
not to be found at Expo 74 as at 
the New York World's Fair. 

Exotic shopping along with a 
large variety of international food 

. boutiques embellish the fantasy-
like experience. You come aw.ay 
with the feeling you've jList been 
around the world. To top it all off, 
a tiny Expo '74 Worlds's Fair flag 
flutters on the highest peak of Mt. 
Kilimanjaro to proclaim to the 
world mankind' s broadening 
effort to protect the environment.
