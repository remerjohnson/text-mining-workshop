NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -
Rutger University's National 
Marriage Projec~ released a 
report this week that found 
couples who live together 
before marriage have a sig-
nificantly higher incidence of 
divorce. Project Co-Director 
David Popenoe said the 
report found that couples 
who live together prior to 
marriage do not develop as 
strong a commitment to the 
relationship as those couples 
who do not cohabitate. The 
report also stated that the 
incidence of child abuse in 
cohabitational homes was 
much higher than that of 
married homes. More than 60 
percent of all couples live 
together before getting mar-
ried.

MAYA ANGELOU 

Jaime Muldool>-Gomez/Guantlan 
Poet: Writer and civil rights activist Maya Angelou speaks before a crowd of 4.400 
students, staff. faculty and community members at RIMAe Arena last Thursday. 

Angelou Brings 'Rainbows' to UCSD 
By ErIka Snider 
News Editor 

Before a capacity crowd of 4,400 UCSD 
students, staff, factdty and San Diego commu-
nity members, renowned poet, author and civil 
rights activist Maya Angelou took the stage in 
RIMAC Arena on Thursday evening to recite 
her poetry, sing hymns and tell stories about her 
life. Her appearance also served as a kick-off to 
UCSD's commemoration of Black History 
Month. 

After being greeted by a standing ovation, 
Angelou began her talk with a mix of poetry 
and song. The main theme behind her opening 
remarks . was the idea of "a rainbow in the 
clouds," which is a poem she wrote that refers 
to a statement in the Book of Genesis in which 
a rainbow was put in the sky by God to give 
people hope. 

"If God put a rainbow right in the clouds in 

the worst of times, then there is a possibility of 
hope," Angelou said. 

Angelou said that she believes that having 
"rainbows in the clouds" not only offer people 
hope, but IIlso provide strength in difficult 
times. 

"Each of us has had rainbows in the clouds," 
Angelou said. "Otherwise, we wouldn' t be 
here." 

The theme of rainbows in the clouds domi-
nated the rest of Angelou's hour-and-a-half-
long speech, which touched on such topics as 
learning poetry and prose as well as finding 
heroes. 

Angelou used examples from her own life as 
well as African-American poetry during the 
evening to support I.er ideas. 

"I have chosen to use African-American 
poetry because it is so beautiful, so rich, so rarely

Organizes 
Marrow Drive 
AttEMIA: Medical student 
Jerry Cheng's brother needs 
transplant to cure his disease 
By KJ.Mln Sung 
Senior Staff Writer 

In an effort to lind a bone marrow donor 
for his younger brother who has aplastic 
anemia, UCSD Medical School student 
Jerry Cheng has organized a bone marrow 
drive. 

The drive will be held from II :30 a.m. to 
4:00 p.m. this Thursday on the Medical 
School campus in the Basic Sciences 
Building, Room MOL #4. 

The San Diego Blood Bank will be draw-
ing and analyzing the blood samples taken 
at the drive. 

Since the characteristics of bone marrow 
are genetically inherited, a patient is more 
likely to find a matching donor within his or 
her own ethnic group. Cheng'S brother is 
Chinese-American. Cheng said that he 
hopes to find a match within the Asian-
American population at UCSD. 

Cheng also said that he and hi s family 
hope to find that match at the bone marrow 
drive, if not for Daniel Cheng, then for 
someone else in need. 

"The more people that come out, the 
higher the chances are of finding a match. 
The larger the bank is, the larger the registry, 
and the beller the possibility that Daniel will 
find a match," Cheng said. 

"It's really up to the people coming out," 
he added. "It really is." 

Daniel Cheng was diagnosed four weeks 
ago with a rare but extremely serious dis-
ease called aplastic anemia. 

"You get the phone call one night, and 
your life is different," Cheng said. "It just 
came down suddenly. It's something that's

Price Center Offices Broken Into Last Week 
CRIME: Police say nothing was 
taken; staff members think that 
perpetrators were looking for cash 
By Vincent GI'I\IMftI 
Senior Stsff ~er 

UCSD Police Detective Douglas O'Dell said 
that burglars broke into the third floor of the 
Price Center last week between Monday night 
and Tuesday morning. O'Dell also said that 
there is no known loss. 

The third floor of the Price Center houses 
offices for the Associated Students, Student 
Organizations and Leadership Opportunities and 
the University Events Office. None of the A.S. 
members' offices were broken into. 

O'Dell said that burglars broke in through the 

northernmost door of the third floor of the Price 
Center and then forcibly entered seven offices. 

Director of Student Activities and 
Governments Lynne Peterson said she was sur-
prised that nothing had been stolen. 

"We're guessing they were looking for cash," 
Peterson said. 

O'Dell said that this burglary is similar to 
four others this year where safes have been bro-
ken into and money stolen. O'Dell said that the 
break-ins may be related. 

O'Dell added that he did not know why the 
burglars did not take anything. 

"Certainly there was stuff there to take like 
computers ... but apparently they neglected to 
take anything," O'Dell said. "There could be any 
number of reasons why. Either they didn't find 
what they were looking for, they were hurried, 

something spooked them or whatever." 
O'Dell said that the police are searching for 

suspects. 
"We are following up on some leads that we 

have," O'Dell said. 
O'Dell said that fingerprints were found at 

the scene. He also said that a pry tool similar to 
a screwdriver was used to break into the doors. 

"I don 't know how long it would take [to 
break into the doorsJ," O'Dell said. '" .Yould 
imagine it would depend on how practiced you 
are. It did take some effort to do it." 

O'Dell said that the campus community has 
been notified about the crime. 

"We did send out notices informing the cam-
pus that this was taking place," 0 ' Dell said. 
"They should be aware of it and aware of how 
they handle money."

The bone marrow ti ssue. which 
is found inside the bones. contains

functioning and not producing 
enough blood cells. This lack of

the same time he realizes that it's 
just something he has to deal with 
and get through. He understands 
that. and it's pretty impressive." 

Cheng said that he has received 
a great deal of support from the 
UCSD community. 

"For the most part, I have a 
good support system here at the 
med school," Cheng said. "All the 
classes are really supportive and 
that helps a lot. I have a lot of good 
support from my girlfriend and my 
classmates." 

For now, Cheng said that he is 
optimistic. 

"We all hope for the best:' 
Cheng said. "Hopefully this is 
something that will, over a period of 
time. resolve. and he can get back to 
doing things he likes to do. He 's got 
a bright future ahead of him."

POET: Angelou 
said that people need 
heroes to survive 
C .... IU ............. 1 
laught, even at some important insti-
tutions I could mention," Angelou 
said. '7he poetry could be credited 
with the survival of the people." 

Angelou then recited several 
poems by the 19th century African-
American poet Paul Lawrence 
Dunbar. Angelou said she used his 
poetry as an example of why she 
wanted to emphasize the impor-
tance for people to go to the library 
and learn. 

"I encourage you, young men 
and women, you are here to make 
use of your library and professors, 
to become a rainbow in the clouds 
for somebody," she said. ''That's 
why you are here." 

AngeJou then recited the works 
of several other poets. She said that 
these works helped to illustrate 
why students should learn poetry 
and other literary forms. 

"00 to the library." she said. 
"Find the poetry; memoriie some 
poetry." 

AngeJou also talked about her 
son, Guy Johnson, who is the head 
of personnel for the City of Oakland. 
Johnson, who is the author of the 
book Sumding at the Scratch Line. 
recently had a nine-hour surgery on 
his spinal column. AngeJou said that 
her son asked her to recite to him the 
lyrics from the poem by William 
Ernest Henley titled "Invictus" - a 
poem which he had memorized in 
his childhood - because he said he 
needed it to help him through the 
ti me after his surgery. 

Angelou said she used this 
example to demonstrate why peo-
ple should know poetry. She said 
that people should "claim some 
poetry" because they will need it in 
times of suffering and despair. 

Angelou also related stories 
from her childhood in Stamps. 
Arkansas. In one story, Angelou 
discussed how she had planned to 
recite a portion of William 
Shakespeare's play ''The Merchant 
of Venice" before heT childhood 
church, but her grandmother pre-
vented her from giving the speech. 
She said her grandmother feared 
that if Angelou gave a speech by a 
white author in a black church, 
white people in the community

would be angered. 
"This was a time when 'the 

boys' came 10 the black part of 
town 10 maim people, 10 kill peo-
ple." she said. "People didn't want 
to bother the white folk." 

Angelou said that she used this 
example to emphasize that all liter-
ature belongs 10 everyone. 

"Men and women, you must 
know all poetry and prose," she 
said. "All of it was written for 
you." 

Toward the end of her speech, 
Angelou said that people need 
heroes today. 

"Each one of us has a rainbow 
in the clouds. and each of us lives 
in direct relation to our heroes and 

'" apologize to those that did not 
have a chance to get tickets." Naik 
said. , 

Several members of the UCSD 
community also spoke about the 
feelings that Angelou's words 
invoked in them. 

"It was incredible," Revelle 
College Dean R~nee Barnett-Terry 
said. "Her presence was inspiring. 
The timeliness of the occasion to 
kick off Black History Month was a 
real treat for San Diego." 

Barnett-Terry also praised Naik 
for the work he did on the event. 

"Despite the obstacles, the neg-
ative expectations, Snehal managed 
to put together an incredible com-
ing together of staff. faculty and 

sheroes." she said. 
Angelou said 

that she believes

she said. "I claim so many people 
when I'm on this Slage ... do it, try

Angelou finished her speech 
with a poem about grandmothers. 
After receiving a standing ovation. 
Angelou gave an encore with her 
recitation of her famed poem "And 
Still) Rise." 

After the event. A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming 
Snehal Naik said that he felt reward-
ed by the outcome of the event. 

"It was a lot of work. but it was 
worth the time put into it," Naik 
said. "Six months ago I had a 
dream. and my dream became a 
reality." . 

Naik said that Angelou's pres-
ence left a huge impression on him. 

"She was probably one of the 
nicest people I have ever met." he 
said. "She was like my grandmoth-
er. She truly cared and wanted to 
get everyone's names right." 

Naik also said that he was 
pleased to see the event sell out in 
six days. He said that he wished he 
could have accommodated more 
people who were interested in 
attending. 

Watson said. 
A.S. President Joe Leventhal 

said that he thought Angelou's 
message was especially relevant 
for students today .• 

"Besides leaving me speechless. I 
think that the lessons she spoke about 
... have amazing value that all stu-
dents ought to hear," Leventhal said. 

Some students said that the talk 
brought forth a number of emotiO!1.'i. 

"At times' was about ready to 
cry," Warren senior Alma Manabat 
said. "It was so inspiring." 

UCSD graduate Tarika 
McCullough, who graduated from 
UCSD in 1998. said she felt similar 
emotions during Angelou's speech. 

"She was very eye-opening and 
brilliant," M,,'Cullough said. '" had 
tears in my eyes." 

San Diego State University 
graduate student Marisol Alvarado

huge impact on her. 

"She's awe inspiring," Alvarado

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, FebnIary 8, 1999 

PINION 
Democrats are participating in a violent shift to the political right to ensure 

Victory in the next pre~idential election. As a result, the liberal agenda is 
disappearing from American polities. 

By Simone SantIni 
Staff Writer 

The American people have a 
remarkable fascination with polls and 
political predictions. There is no other 
country that succumbs to them so great-
ly. Whether this fascination is due more 
to a genuine desire to know the infor-
mation or to a latent social insecurity 
and hysteric necessity to be reassured, 
one dares not investigate. 

Whatever the answer, it remains a 
fact that a full 22 months beforc the 
November 2000 elections. the political 
game of names and figures is in full 
swing. Since the Democratic nomina-
tion will very likely be bestowed upon 
AI Gore, the most interesting move-
ments are expected in the GOP field. 
The Geriatric Old Party has. for now, 
narrowed the lield to three names: 
George Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Dan 
Quayle. So far, the polls have the first 
two of this unholy trinity outrunning AI 
Gore. Like a sturdy weed. 
RepUblicanism will not go away. The 
more damage conservatives do, the 
harder it is to get rid of them. 

How can a liberal soul hope to 
oppose to the formidable trio? Dan 
Quayle is the most dangerous of the 
group. The o!,ly politician with his own 
"Yahoo" category on the web (Go to 
Humor, Quotations and then Dan 
Quayle at www.yahoo.com). Quayle 
has the precious gift of being able to 
make people laugh. Truth be told, he 
docsn ' t understand why people are 
laughing. but, as Ronnie Reagan 
proved, not knowing what you are talk-
ing about can be a powerful political 
weapon. One should not forget that 
Quayle is the person who could say 
with both firm voice and unblinking 
eye, "We are ready for any unforeseen 
event that mayor may not occur." and 
"We're going to have the best educated 
American people in the world." 

If Quayle wins the nomination, the 
only candidate who could put up a fair 
fight is Jerry Seinfeld. Fortunat.ely, he 
is now free from his network commit-
ments and has enough money to pay for 
his own campaign. There is hope. 

Then there is Elizabeth Dole, or-
"how far are we willing to go in order 
to have a woman in the White House." 
I agree that the time has come to pay 
part of our political debt to the under-
represented half of humanity and elect 
a woman president. But why, in a coun-
try with 130 million women, we should 
choose Elizabeth Dole to fill this role is 
beyond my comprehension. The 
woman proved herself as president of 
the Red Cross by single-handedly 
destroying an anti-AIDS campaign on 
the grounds of religious beliefs. I shud-
der when I think of what she might do 
in the While House. 

Finally, here comes Georgie Bush Jr. 
Junior has quite an extensive political 
record, making it easier to understand 
what he might do in Washington. (Dole 
doesn't have such a political pedigree, 
and Quayle .. . well, he is lucky if he 
can find Washington). As aovemor qf 

Texas, Bush's most remarkable achieve-
ment has been a $2 billion property tax 
cut, which will benefit mainly wealthy 
land and property owners (many of 
whom are his political supporters). At 
the same time, more than 40 percent of 
all Texan families lack adequate health 
care and reportedly worry about 
whether they can afford food. Only 34 
percent of those eligible in Texas will 
receive food stamps in the coming 
years. Yet, Junior is immensely popular 
in Texas, and, if elections were held 
today. he would be the next President. 

In this not-so-reassuring situation, 
what spaces of political maneuvering are 
there for a true Democratic and liberal 
candidacy? Not many, unfortunately. In 
the past decade, the country has rnoved 
violently to the political right. This is the 
decade of Christian fundamentalism, of 
Newt Gingrich and of bold and unapolo-
getic conservatism. This is also the 
decade in which a person like Bush can 
call himself a "moderate." We must keep 
this picture in mind if we want to under-
stand why mainstream Democrats don 't 
consider the nomination of AI Gorc a 
possible disaster. 

Would a candidate with a liberal -
or even merely ratiohal - political 
agenda even have a chance in 20007 It 
doesn't seem probable. A liberal agen-
da should. for instance, make the war 
on poverty one of its most important 
points. The distribution of wealth in the 
United States is the most skewed in the 
industrial world. 

Check, for example, the difference 
between the average and the median 
incomes in America. The concentration 
of wealth in the top percentiles of the 
income curve is increasing, the wages 
and living standards of the middle class · 
have been steadily declining for the 
past 15 years. Now. 35 million 
Americans live below the poverty 
level. Between 5 and 10 million adults 
have been homeless al some lime in 
their lives, and all the conservative 
rhetoric about "self reliance" is not 
going 10 help them. A more equitable 
wealth distribulion needs to be encour-
aged: The chain of poverty can be bl'Oo' 
ken by granting everybody access to 
affordable, quality education. 

A liberal agenda should improve 
public schools. Thirty years ago, the 
United States had one of the ten best 
education syslems in the world. Now it 
has one of lhe worst in the developed 
world. No other industrialized country 
has a functional illiteracy rate of 15 
percent. 

The high level of crime and violence 
in America also needs to be considered 
rationally - we must not resort to an 
easy and emotionally charged solution, 
which will only ' make the problem 
worse. The focus should shifl from 
building more prisons (which is just 
good business for contracton) to pre-
vention and rehabilitation. 

The list goes on wilh more issues 
like the environment. forei ... policy or 
the right to heakh caR. It is unlikely,

GROUP POWER TRIuMPHS OVER THE INDIVIDUAL 
COMMENTARY: 
Student organizations 
allow like-minded 
people to effect change 
By C ........ Donov_ 
Contributi/1f Opinion Writer 

The individual: inconsequential. 
weak, impotent. A collaborative 
organization of individuals: power-
ful. able, effective. Even though 
many of us grow up with images of 
the lone hero saving the day -
John Wayne, Bruce Lee, Xena -
today organizations are one of the 
most powerful forces effecting 
social change. 

It is hard being out there in the 
big, bad world, experiencing first-
hand the injustices and hardships 
from which you spent your youth 
being sheltered (of course. I'm 
speaking from personal experi-
ence here). It is easy to fall into 
the trap of hopelessness and 
despair. One begins .to wonder. 
how can anyone change anything? 
How can I, as an individual, battle 
against the plethora of problems 
that plagues our society today? 
This is where organizations enter 
the discussion. 

I spent my first two years at 
UCSD thinking I had no power, 
that I was entirely unable to attack 
the evils that be. 

Then one fine autumn day in 
. the beginning of the quarter, a 

cute young man appeared in front 
or my biometry class and spoke , 
about an organization for social 
change and student power -
California Public Interest 
Research Group. I had heard of 
CALPIRG before. and had even 
pledged to give them $5 per quar-
ter long ago. I have always cared 
about the environment and wanted 
to get involved in an organization 
that also cared. But due to my 
extreme "busyness" and. more 
importantly. my unwillingness to 
get off my ass. I had never pur-
sued this desire. 

But on this particular fine 
autumn day I was actually between 
jobs (I have since'become gainful-
ly employed) and, fired up by his 
speech about the evil oil companies 
wanting to drill in Alaska - an act 
that would destroy the entire 
ecosystem, a few rare species and 
the lifestyle of an entire race of 
people - felt a strange, new desire 
within me. 

I felt a desire to join - to add 
my paltry individual power to that 
of others like myself who. together. 
could be a mighty force to be reck-
oned with. I joined CALPIRG. 

I didn ' t just join - I dove in 
headfirst, becoming an intern and 
co·coordinator for the Clean

will tell you this - Ueel that it is 
one of the best decisions I have 
made. 

Student organizations such as 
CALPIRG, Amnesty International 
and Committee for World 
Democracy serve several useful 
functions at UCSD. These groups 
give like-minded individuals a 
chance to join together and work 
on issues that really mailer to them. 
They are like a chisel. chipping a 
little away from the unfairness and 
injustices that plague us. 

Aside from fulfilling the altru-
istic desires of their members, 
these organizations make an 
important irrlJlact on the issues 
they address. Amnesty 
International and Committee for 
World Democracy wield their 
power on an international scale. 
while CALPIRG's influence has 
reached from the campus of 
UCSD all the way to our capital in 
Sacramento. 

So there I was at my first 
CALPIRG core meeting, realizing 
that (oh-mi-god) there are people 
out there, and even people at 
UCSD, who care about things other 
than studying and the coolness of 
Geisel Library on a Friday night. 
Beyond that, they care about the 
issues that I deem, as an individual, 
important and socially relevant. 

All of the things CALPIRG has 

achieved since its inception have 
been due to the efforts individuals 
- individuals who alone may have 
felt powerless and incapable of 
effecting change. Together. they 
have been able to open a can 0' 
whup ass on environmental and 
social issues. 

Every Monday at 5:30 p.m .. 
when I walk into the Old Student 
Center, room 203, I'm entering a 
room full of people just like me -
a room full of single voices ready 
to join together into a mighty shout. 
screaming for what is right and 
good. To join was impetuous, to 
stay was a challenge and to care 
was an effort. In the end, it is worth 
it. 

There are 12,000 lobbyists in 
Sacramento. Only twelve of them 
are environmentalists. If 
CALPIRG were not adding its 
voice, we as individuals would not 
be doing our duty to our fellow 
humans and, more importantly. to 
future generations. 

Besides, it sure feels nice to 
have one selfless outlet in my oth-
erwise selfish life. Corny as it 
may sound, I really like the idea 
of giving a little back. And though 
your parents gave you life, we all 
owe our existence to Mother 
Earth.

They ' re absolutely fascinaled with

car just cuts me off." All would 
claim that 'the other 99 were awful, 
while they conductcd themselves

this type of driver. Not only does he

The fact is. AI Gore looks a lot 
more like a moderatc Republican 
than a Democrat. This. of course. 
makes him very appcaling to thc 
Democratic Party. The Republicans 
have swung to the cxtreme right, 
and are unable to get rid of the fun-

nearly hit my car! And yet, when I 
think about it, his anger is actually 
justified. Bless you, kind sir. I shall 
be a bad driver no more. and it's all 
thanks to you!" 

Even if my dad does get road

(;ompared to my mother. She 
adheres to the ·'Drive it like it's 
stolen" philosophy: Drive much 
too fast and with uller disregard to 
the unfortunate individuals in her 
path. Every trip is a white-knuck-
ler. especially whcn she swerves 
into the path of big rigs. Typically, 
the trip ends with her passengers 
!linging doors open. emerging and 
thanking God for seat belts. 

I pity all those foolish enough to 
cut in front of her. If tailgating were 
an Olympic event, she would be a 
shoo-in for the gold. Usually when 
she drives the bumpers are good

vote for the ~mocrat anyway, for 
lack of a beller option. 

AI Gore is the perfect candidatc 
for this strategy. He has supponed 
Clinton's welfare reform program

other driver will be frantically 
looking over her shoulder. She gets 
upset and keeps asking, "Why do 
they keep looking at me?" 

All of this leaves me with two 
possible conclusions: that everyone 
is deluded about the quality of his 
or her driving skills. happily tool-
ing along while wreaking 'havoc on 

the streets, or that there are a 
few wackjobs out there causing 
the majority of the damage. 

But, just like my parents, 
absolutely no one will admit to 
being terrible behind the wheel. 

So, I'll be the lone voice in the 
wilderness and declare that I am a 
lousy driver. 

In my five years of driving, I've 
already been in three accidents, not 
counting the other various mishaps 
that didn't leave any marks on the 
other cars. My first was four 
months after receiving my license, 
when I turned into the front bumper 
of a lovely Lexus. which had been 
purchased, yes, you guessed it, that 
very afternoon. The Lexus owner 
informed me (at the top of his 
lungs) that he had just driven it oil 
the lot, about two blocks from 
where I hit it. Oops. 

So, maybe all of the moaning 
about bad driving is justified. 
Maybe that's just me. But is that 
any reason to be angry? Everyone 
should remember to be more 
patient out there. You might just be 
screaming at me or my family.

Wellstone, who would have fos-
tered a more liberal agenda, just 
announced that they won't run. Bill 
Bradley 's agenda is still a bit 
obscure, but at least the man can 
cite Brecht's Galileo during a live 
interview, which is more than most 
candidates can do. Bradley has a 
very slim chance, though: Barring 
any last minute surprises, nothing 
stands between AI Go{e and the 
Democratic nomination. 

The last president elected in the 
20th century will continue the leit-
motif of the '80s and '90s, and for 
those who like "business as usual," 
that's not a bad thought.

MP3s Change Music I Students Ask for Old Policy 
SOUNDS: Downloadable files cause problems for 
Tower Records and other major music retailers 

ACTION: Berkeley ASUC senators passed a bill asking Governor Davis to 
bring back affirmative action; also asked for resignation of Ward Connedy 

.,"'ROIIn 
The Dally Free Press (Boston U.) 

BOSTON. Mus. - With more 
music available on the Inlemd than 
ever before. the music industry is 
adoptins SlrIIcgies to take advan-
laie of the chanles. 

A new lCChnoloJy is edging into 
the music industry. the way com-
pact discs pushed rcc:ords almost 
out of use over the past decade. 

MP3 is a new computer devel-
opmentthit compresses music files 
so they can be downloaded more 
quickly. 

In addition, those who down-
load MP3 files can liSlen to music 
on their computen and can also 
transfer the songs onto an MP3 
player. 

This device is similar to a 
portable cassette player and allows 
people to listen to downloaded · 
music away from their computers. 
It usually sells for about $200. 

These developments have 
caused major changes in the music 
business, said Jo Sager. executive 
vice president of marketing for the 
Rolling Stone Network, a company 
that manages web sites for Rolling 
Stone, The Source, Down Beat 
Jazz and JAMTV. 

"It's an interesting time right 
now," Sager said. "In the computer 
industry, it is what we call an 
inflection point - a time when 
everything chanJCs, like the intro-
duction of personal computers or 
the changes from vinyl to cassettes 

to COs." 
Web sites that offer MP3 files 

expose music fans to • wider vari-
ety of genres and bands than tradi-
tional music sources. Sager said. 
Many of these sites connect 
browsers to artist biographies and 
can customize searches to create a 
user preference profile. 

While computer usen may 
enjoy listening to music for free 
online, artists and labels face the 
challenge of making a profit on the 
technolOl)', Sager said. There are 
some companies that offer legiti-
mate music files, but lOme people 
post pirated songs for which artists 
are never paid. 

"The first issue is the proper 
payment of.royalties to the intellec-
tual properly holder." said Mike 
Farrace, vice president of market-
ing for Tower Records. "With the 
MP3 there is no assurance the artist 
is getting paid." 

To address this problem, the 
Recording Industry Association of 
America is organizing a system in 
which digital music can be distrib-
uted, but those who own rights to 
the music will be properly compen-
sated, Farrace said. 

Additionally, music retailers are 
still testing the water of consumer 
interest in online sales. Tower 
Records, which established a web-
site in 1995 and began distributing 
music digitally two months ago, is 
still gauging online sales' success, 
Farrace said. 

By LIndII .... 
Daily ClJllfornIan (U. Clllifomi. 
Berlreley) 

BERKELEY. Calif. - Hoping 
to bring affirmative action back 
into the UC system. the ASUC 
Senate has passed a bill asking 
California Gov. Gray Davis to 
change the face of the UC Board 
of Regents. 

UC Berkeley's student govern-
ment approved a bill Wednesday 
night, wrillen and sponsored by 
Senator Arlan White, that asks 
Divis to fill the five currently 
open seats on the board with affir-
mative action proponents. 

"I think [the bill] will have 
impact in that it will complement 
other actions," White said. 
"However, by itself, it is not that 
powerful." 

A different form of the bill was 
originally written by Heather 
Bergman, a member of the 
Coalition to Defend Affirmative 
Action by Any Means Necessary, 
a campus pro-affirmative action 
group. White said Bergman 
approached him with the bill to try 
to get it through the senate. He 
later altered the bill and wrote the 
official draft. 

One of the changes that Cal-
Serve member White made to the 
bill before senators passed it was 
replacing the word "demand" with 
the less-forceful word "ask." 

"It is only right that we give 
the governor an opponunity to 

[further affirmative action efforts] 
without demanding it," White 
said. 

White, who is not affiliated 
with BAMN, is DOl the only sup-
porter of affirmative action poli-
cies in the student senate. He said 
he was approached because "they 
have seen me fight in the past. and 
I am a visible person." 

He added that he appealed to 
Davis because "as of now, I see 
Davis as someone who has a 
responsibility to help because 
people who elected him are the 
people who would benefit from 
affirmative action policies." 

The bill also asks for the vol-
untary resignation of UC Regent 
Ward Connerly, who led the cam-
paign to ban race and gender pref-
erences in the UC system in 1995 
and statewide through Proposition 
209 in 1996. 

"I firmly believe that 
Connerly's crusade to abolish 
affirmative action policies is a tool 
to assist him in his political 
goals," White said. 

Further, according to the bill, 
"[Connerly] has done immeasur-
able harm to the lives and futures 
of countless numbers of students. 
He is an enemy of education." 

The bill was widely supported 
by the senators and was opposed 
only by senator Todd Dipaola. 

"I, personally, am not in favor 
of affirmative action," Dipaola 
said. 

''There are a lot of other sena-
tors who feel [the same] way but 
are not voting their conscience." 

Connerly could not be 
reached yesterday to comment 
on the bill. 

As · for the support from the 
other senators, White said he was 
surprised by the bill's overwhelm-
ing approval. 

"I did not know so many pro-
ponents of affirmative action were 
in the senate," White said. 

Of these supporters, many 
expressed hope that the new bill 
will accomplish needed reforms. 

"I am very pleased it was 
passed," Senator Prisci lIa 
Hernandez said. "Affirmative 
action is necessary within the UC 
system to maintain diversity 
because things are not equal at this 
time." 

White offered a personal testi-
mony about the benefits of affir-
mative action. 

"Had it not been for affirma-
tive action policies, [Cal-SERVE 
Senator] Cris Arzate and myself 
would not be hcre. and I think we 
are preuy qualified students," 
White said. 

"I think it is funny that oppo-
nents of affirmative action cry that 
racial discrimination is so perva-
sive when affirmative action poli-
cies are in effect," he added. "If 
this were so, ethnic minorities 
would have taken over ttie coun-
try."

What men are really thinking 
in those tiny little brains of theirs 

W hen Mary asked me to write this anicle. I thought, "Dam mit, Mary has been eating the paste in her ans and crafts class again!" Then I figured Ihis was her way of geuing back al me for calling her column Ihe "(nsliMe of 
Male Bashing." 

Mary lold me ( could wrile about anything ( wanled and Ihis 
got me really excited. ( had visions of wriling a really MALE 
column about fOOlball (oh, what a greal Niners article ( could 
wrile!), beer (gol 10 love Sammy) or women (Jennifer Love 
Hewiu ... more on Ihis later). Then Mary said, ··Well. Ihal 
sounds nice. but why don'l you wrile aboul Valenline's Day 
from a male perspective'!" 

Male perspeclive? I lhoughl. "You ' ve got 10 be kidding!" 
That's like pulling "boob reduclion" and "Pamela Anderson" in 
the same senlence - il just doesn'l happen. (Ihought aboul 
this for a week, and was almosl ready to Ihrow in Ihe lowel 
when il hit me. For Valentine's Day I could wrile about how 
Ihere really are sensitive men out Ihere in the world. ( could 
help give women hope! 

BUI where 10 find Ihis guy? I searched my brain for hours 
until it finally hil me .. . my roommate, whom we shall call the 
"Swedish Sweelheart," has 10 be Ihe mosl sensitive guy in Ihe 
world! 

This guy is so in louch wilh his sensitive side Ihal I swear 
he is a female in disguise. About'lwo weeks ago I was in his 
room frantically searching for a CD when ( came across Ihe 
Dirty Dancing soundtrack. It was convenienlly hidden under 
the bed. When ( showed it to a third roommate, we both ended 
up roaring in laughter. 

BUI ( did not wanl to jump to conclusions, so ( wailed until 
he gOI home to ask him about il. He said Ihe music company 
had sent him Ille wrong CD. So' ( thought, "Welllhal 's cool," 
and didn't really Ihink much of ii, until ( saw him go inlo his 
room and put lhe CD inlo his stereo and lislen 10 il on his head-
phones. 

( Ihought Ihe incident was maybe a one-time Ihing. BUI 
something else happened last week. We were browsing Ihe 
channels logether and the movie "Dirty Dancing" jusl hap-
pened 10 be on TNT. Now, I wanled to walch "Up In Smoke." 
but the Sweetheart said he wanled to walch "Dirty Dancing" 
because he liked lhe ending and wanted to pick up some moves .

Psychotherapy Mary offers up her 
version of love, sex, in the '90s 

And now, for Ihe exciling conclusion of Cosmo-Guardian. This article wraps up a Ihree-part series on men, and also happens 10 be an exlra-speciallribule 10 Valenline's Day. For your read-ing pleasure, I asked a very good guy pal of mine 
10 co-aulhor a column aboul this romantic holiday. Ithoughl il 
would be inleresling to have a real,live man's poinl-of-view on 
your favorite lopic and mine ... lrue love! 

This friend agreed 10 write under Ihe condilion of anonymi-
ty - he was afraid all his friends would laugh at him if Ihey 
found OUI. Lei's just say Ihat he 's tall , drop-dead gorgeous and 
likes to pretend he's from the ghello. (mel him last summer, but 
[didn ' l really get to know him untillhe men's water polo sea-
son slarted up in Seplember - I'm a big waler polo fan and he 
was number 12 on Ihe UCSD leam. 

So anyway: Ihis friend of mine - from here on I'll refer 10 
him only by his code name "Bryan Traverso" - Is one of Ihe 
funniest guys I've ever met, so I knew he'd be perfect for the 
job! 

"People think my column is sexisl," I told him. "( need you 
10 show Ihe women of Ihe world how sensilive and caring men 
can be!" 

Lillie did ( know Ihal when I told him 10 wrile aboul "love" 
he Ihoughl I meant Jennifer Love Hewill of "Party of Five" 
fame. He devoted nearly half of his column to her many assets 
(ahem) and applauded her magnificent acting skills ("Gawd, 
Bailey!"). 

Thai's not 10 say he has a one-Irack mind; he also did a lil-
lie PR work for his "sensilive" roommate. Ladies, gel ready to 
swoon! By Ihe lime you are done reading my friend's column, 
you'll be begging me 10 give you his room male's phone num-
ber. Let me tell you, i fTraverso's career as a male slripper does-
n'ltake off soon, ( think he should jusl go into public relations. 

Seriously, his column gOI me .hinking aboul my guy pals' 
love lives. Why is ii , ( wondered, Ihal lotal hollies like Ihe 
"Swedish Sweelheart" are single? How is it thai in Ihis day and 
age - when M:ores of women are apparently on the lookout for 
"a few nice guys" - Ihal all my "nice" guy friends are avail-
able'! 

Lalely, a 101 of these inlelligent, good-looking guys have 
complained to me Ihal Ihey never get any "chicks_" Since 
romance is my favorile subject, ( buckled down last week to

HE SAID: 
How literature, film, 
theatre, and art 
c ... ud ..... Ne. 

I could not believe he was mak-
ing me watch this thing; my mas· 
culinity was being threatened. The 
last dance scene looked like the 
'Thriller" video. I mean, if they 
had just given Patrick Swayze a 
white glove. a red jacket and a 
maybe a nose job, then it delinitely 
would have been "Thriller." 

I began to think that maybe he 
just liked the movie after all. I 
mean, it's not that bad ... there are a 
few lame pans, but all in all, it 's 
OK. So I didn't think about it 
again. Then a couple of days ago, I 
was studyi'ng in my room when the 
Sweethean came home and turned 
on the TV. So I decided to go watch 
TV with him. I went into the living 
room and saw that he was watch· 
ing ... Richard Simmons!? 

"Dammit, Swede!" I yelled. 
"When is it going to end? First it 
was the 'Diny Dancing' thing, now 
Richard Simmons? Come on!" 

He claimed I walked in just as 
he was about to tum the channel. 
but I still have my doubts. Don't 
get me wrong, I think he's cool, but 
I was about to go out and buy him 
hot pink spandex. Well ... I guess 
I've shown you (hat sensitive men 
do exist. Enough of that. 

I've talked about what girls sup-
posedly want. but what do guys 

SHE SAID: 
Mary gives men a 
little advice 
C .... II ............. 
find a solution to their problem. 
After many hours of deliberation, I 
came up with a few suggestions. If 
you're having trouble finding a 
woman. give these strategies a try. 

(I) Have the object of your 
affection take the "Purity Test" on 
the Internet and ask her what her 
score is. 111en oller to help lower it. 
Sure, this may sound rather crude, 
but some girls appreciate that kind 
of honesty. Plus, Valentine's Day is 
approaching fast. so this is no time 
to be subtle! 

(2) Invite her over to see 
"Armageddon" or some other dis-
aster film. This will depress your 
woman and she' ll seek comfon in 
your arms. Of course. this plan will 
backfire unless you control your 
urge to make fun of Ben AfIleck. 
For some reason. women take Ben 
Affieck very seriously. 

(3) Variation of suggestion two: 
Invite her over to see "West Side 
Story." Pretend like you actually 
own this movie. Resist the urge to 
burst out laughing during the 
"dancing gangster" scenes. When 
Tony goes pirouetting down the 
street singing "Maria," look ador· 
ingly into her eyes and whisper, "I 
know exactly how he feels." 

(4) When you finally manage to 
get her alone, DO NOT spend the 
whole evening CUlling yourself 
down. The other day, I walked 
across campus with a guy who kept 
telling me what a "loser" he was. 
Until that point. I thought of him as 
being fairly sexy, but by the time 
we got to Warren Lecture Hall. I 
had to agree with him. 

I've bilked IIIIoat 
............ pp ...... 
., w.., but 'wIIat do 
"'.W_In • 
YII ....... ' • .,., 
... • ., (Or acta .. .,

could P two w.,. 
with thl. - I could 
.. , what women 
w.nt to .... or I 
could .. , what ... ,. 
•• r .. l., thinking. 
want in a Valentine's Day date? (Or 
actually any date.) Now I could go 
two ways with this - I could say 
what women want to hear or I 
could say what guys are really 
thinking. 

Now if I were on a date. the lirst 
thing I would want would be Jen-

. nifer Love Hewitt. Not to get off 
the subject, but I am seriously in 
love with that chick. After seeing 
her in two movies, I fell in love 
with her acting abilities. I mean she 
was really convincing. and I can 
now swear that she has not had a 
boob job because they are the same 
size in both movies. 

I really just think she is cute ... 
not hot. but cute - and despite what 
my companions have said about her, 
she does not have a big bull! Hey, 
speaking of big bullS. did anyone

"WIIk. upl auys 
don't ,_ ., better 
tIuIn thIsI" Well, 
wMt eM ,OU ...,., 
Lov. I. field ..... so 
.. women. 

(5) Advenise yourself:! I took a 
public relations class last quaner 
and learned that if you can per-
suade people nuclear power 
improves Ihe environment, then 
you can sell anything! The next 
time a cute girl is bad·mouthing 
some guy for being a jerk. quickly 
point out that you would never act 
like that. You should exude conli· 
dence because you know you're a 
hot commodity. You're so money. 
baby! Just be careful not go over-
board or she'll think you're arro-
gant ... it's a fine line. 

(6) If girls keep rejecting you, 
re-evaluate the type of girl you' re 
asking out. I'm sorry to say this. 
but my single guy friends often 
fantasize for weeks about the 
hOliest-looking girl in their classes 
and then are stunned when she 
shoots them down. Sometimes 
those supermodel-types have really 
bad manners. Or sometimes they 
(gasp!) already have boyfriends. 
Maybe you guys should stan hang-
ing out with ditTerenttypes of girls. 
It's just a suggestion. 

(7) There's nothing wrong with 
begging. If you like a girl, ask her 

The UCSD Guardian 

walch "Celebrity Deathmatch" on 
MTV during the Superbowl half-
time? I was just wondering, does 
JeMifer Lopez really have that big 
of a bull'! I'm just wondering. 

Anyway, let me get back to the 
subject. What do guys really want? 
Now. I might surprise you with this-(1 
know most women think that all guys 
want is sex). but to be honest. all a 
guy really wants to know is what the 
hecl/ is going on inside a woman's 
head. If guys knew this, the dating 
world would be so much easier. 

So I beg of you women. the next 
time you are on a date (Valentine's 
or whatever), do not play games 
with the guy - just be honest. If 
you don' t like him, don't drop him 
like a bad habit. Instead, tell him 
the truth - you think he's great but 
you like being single, etc. Now if 
you do like him. just lell him' I can 
guarantee that if he is out on a date 
with you or hangs out with you a 
lot. then you have nothing to worry 
about. 

Anyway, I hope you all have a 
good V-day. I know what I will be 
doing ... heading for Hollywood 

. and looking for my girl. But 
remember. there are sensitive guys 
out there - not all of them are 
scum. Women, anytime you think a 
guy is not heing sensitive. remem· 
ber the Swedish Sweethean - who 
is currently single' Also. before I 
go. I would like to know if anyone 
has an opinion on the Jennifer 
Lopez bUll thing. I was just won-
dering .... 

out and don't feign nonchalance ("I 
have nothing better to do Sunday 
night, and I'm going to a movie. so 
if you want 10 come along, I guess 
that would be OK.") Just tell her 
you'd like to buy her dinner and 
ask her when she's available 
(unfonunately she might already 
have plans for V-Day). Your 
straightforward tactic might embar-
rass her, but she'll get over it. 
Promise. 

(8) Launch an all-out campaign 
to w~n her affections! Write her a 
mushy Valentine's Day card and 
sign it, "Your Secret Admirer." 
Leave it on her doorstep on Tues-
day. Send her Oowers on Wednes· 
day. Mail her a tape of her fav()l:ite 
love songs on Thursday. Pester her 
friends for feedback on Friday. 
Reveal your identity and confess 
your undying love on Saturday. 
Follow this plan, and she' ll be 
swooning in your arms by Sunday. 
(I think "swoon" is my new 
favorite word ... I've been reading a 
lot of trashy romance novels lately 
to get in the Valentine's mood). 

If these helpful hints don't get 
you a date in lime for Valentine's 
Day. I don't know what to say. 
Despite your manliest effons, some 
girls just don't have a clue when it 
comes to men. Every time I see 
some girl shooting one of my guy 
pals down in flames. I want to 
shake her vigorously and yell, 
"Wake up! Guys don't get any bet-
ter than thisl" Well, what ,an you 
do'! Love is fickle and so are 
women. Have a fantastic V-day, 
UCSD. Much love, The Psycho 
Therapist.

The sun is still in Aquarius. cul-
minating with a new moon in 
Aquarius this weekend, so it's time 
for all of us to learn how to be ana-
lytical and to work together as a 
team. Those are two Aquarian spe-
cialties. Monday, the lesson is 'to 
learn how to take orders, and 
quickly, while the moon transits 
powerful Scorpio. Tuesday and 
Wednesday, the truth will come 
out, as the moon in Sagittarius 
crosses Pluto. the planet symboliz-
ing transfonnation. On Thursday 
and Friday, the moon's passage 
through Capricorn stimulates 
inventions that ease the workload;

HOROSCOPES 
and on Saturday and Sunday. the 
moon's passage through Aquarius 
produces a scientific breakthrough. 

ARIES 
March 21 - April 19 

Your money is locked away in a 
safe place, hopefully. because 
today you're going to want to get at 
it and spend it on frivolous things. 
The temptations are intense. but the 
risks are also high. Tuesday and 
Wednesday are good for travel, if 
you'd like to actually check out the 
possibilities you've been dreaming 
about. Thursday. the reality rears its 
ugly head, and you'll have to deal 
with career-related mailers t .. rough 
Friday. If you're paying allention. 
you could make a bundle then. Sat-
urday and Sunday are your best 
days all week for playing with 
friends, or launching team ven-
tures. 

TAURUS 
April 20 - May 20 

Go along with a partner's whim 
on Monday, especially if it has any-
thing to do with your home, family 

or a household item. Real estate is 
also an adventure you should get 
into only with your partner's sup-
port. Tuesday and Wednesday are 
good shopping days with incredible 
bargains available. Be very careful, 
however, that you don't also spend 
more for something than it is 
worth. Thursday through Saturday 
are good for travel, so take those 
days off if you can. Be respectful of 
others on Sunday, to make the very 
best impression. 

GEMINI 
May.21 -./ltIle 21 

Take care at work. If you don 't 
pay attention to what's going on 
around you, you could smash right 
into a hrick wall. Tuesday and 
Wednesday, your partner could 
really surprise you. Something new 
that you lind out could change 
everything. Thursday through Sat-
urday, take care of business. 
Whether you win or lose depends 
on how shrewdly you play the 
game. Saturday and Sunday arc 
best for travel, but romance may 
still be elusive.

CANCER 
./une 22 -./u~y 22 

Monday could be a rough day 
for some people, but it ought to be 
rather neat for you. There's a nice 
big grand trine in water signs. 
When this happens, you get very 
lucky, and this time you're lucky in 
love. Tuesday and Wednesday will 
be a little bit' more stressful, since 
more work is required. Don't goof 
ofT then. You'd get into trouble. 
Thursday through Saturday, a part-
ner shows up to help, and to tell 
you what to do. A welcome relief. 
And on Sunday, you could make a 
decision together that would affect 
your future for year •. Think it over 
carefully first. 

LEO 
./u~y 23 - Aug. 22 

If you 're stuck with a problem 
at home Monday, maybe what 
you 're missing is advice from a 
person whose job it is to save 
money, or bring it in. It's not the 
money you need so much right 
now. It's just a lillie bit of objective

perspective. Search for revehHions 
in romantic relationships Tuesday 
and Wednesday. A secret admirer 
could be revealed. If a partner is 
pUlling demands on you Saturday 
or Sunday, make the commitment. 
That's what he or she really wants. 

VIRGO 
Aug. 23 - Sept . 22 

If you don't get anything else 
done Monday except selling up 
your schedule for the following 
month, you'll be moving ahead. 
Watch out for accidents and other 
surprises at home on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Those arc also good 
days to find lost ohjects. Romance 
pops to mind on Thursday but may 
not happen until Fnday. Saturday 
morning looks good lor that too. A 
setback on Saturday turns OUI OK 
when something else becomes 
available. and a hassle on Sunday is 
solved with quick thinking.

14 FEAniRES 

HOROSCOPES: 
C ....... d,.... ..... U 
day. ahd you might as well get 
aggressive about il. Looks like you 
have plenty of work to do, but are 
you being paid what you're worth'! 
If you're not it's nobody's fault but 
your own. Tuesday and Wednesday. 
are full of surprises. Take notcs so 
you don'l forgel new information 
you hear. Thursday and Friday are 
good days to change stuff around 
your house. or to strip your kitchen 
floors. You' II be in the mood to do 
the work and get things righl. This 
weekend is fabulous for romance 
with an intellectual type. 

SCORPIO 
Oct. 23 - Nov. 21 

You're looking good on Mon-
day. The moon's in your sign. too, 
which really increases your power. 
Tuesday and Wednesday, the 
money pours in. and runs back out 
again almost as fast as it came. You 
can be lucky with a gamble then, 
but don't put it back down and lose 
it before you even get to spend any 
of it. Learn through practicing on 
Thursday and Friday, and stick 
close to home this weekend. The 
most interesting thing will be going 

on there. 

SAGITTARIUS 
Nov. 22 - Dec. 21 

Monday looks like a rather frus-
trating day for you. Something 
you're trying to accomplish is nol 
gelling through. Perhaps it's 
because_ you're not communicating 
effectively. Inslead of trying 10 
explain. ask leading questions. 
You'lI be much stronger on Tues-
day and Wednesday when the 
mood goes through your sign. Save 
new projects for then. Thursday 
and Friday, the Capricorn mood 
helps you be more practical, so 
Ihose are good days for shopping. 
Saturday and Sunday are good for 
catching up on your reading. 

CAPRICORN 
Dec. 22 - jan. 19 

Looks like what you and your 
commiuee want is just not avail-
able Monday. Apparenlly il'lIlake 
a liule more planning, a lillie more 
research and possibly a few more 
fund-raisers. The pressure is on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. and 
Ihings are popping up fasl. Expect 
major changes during Ihat phase. 
On Thursday. it's coming together, 
and by Friday, you'lI be much more

powerful. Spend money to make 
more that day. A friend's sugges-
tion doesn't pan out on Saturday, 
but you'll find another way to get 
what you wanl. On Sunday, again 
your first impulse docsn'l work, but 
leads to an idea thai does. 

AQUARIUS 
jan. 20 - Feb. 18 

On Monday, an older person is 
going to want to order you around. 
That's ridiculous, of course. You 
know everything, or at least you 
think you do, bul this other person 
docsn'l seem 10 care. He or she just 
wanlS the power. And once you 
understand that, the whole situation 
will be easier to deal with. Tuesday 
and Wednesday are best for com-
mittee meelings and team sports, 
and coffcc breaks will run longer 
Ihan usual then. On Thursday and 
Friday, the pressure is back on. as 
everyone scramblcs 10 get the work 
done, including you. Over the 
weekend, you'll shine. Plan some-
Ihing speciallhen. 

PISCES 
Feb. 19 - March 20 

The moon is in Scorpio Mon-
day. which calms you down, and 
also gives you a lillie bil of an 

overview of the situation. Noticing 
is the first step in solving problems. 
SIaI1 by makillJ a list of them. 
Tuesday and Wednesday are going 
to be kind of tough. Looks like an 
older penon has some plans that 
you may not agree with. Speak up, 
but nicely. Wednesday and Thun-
day, get together with friends and 
accomplish something you could-
n'l do alone. SlIUrday and Sunday, 
your mind will be buzzing. Don't 
believe what you hear without 
checking it OUI first.

struggle with UCD 
C ... hL ........ ~1O 
good job of handling the adversilY 
[though)." O'Brien said. 

Wilh the wind calm and the sky 
overcast at Trilon Field on Sunday. 
UCSD took the field and ran inlo a 
storm of Aggie offense in the firs' 
inning. 

The first seven Aggie batters 
reached base before John Gherini 
threw a fine pick-off throw 10 Ihird 
to end a four-run inning by Davis. 

In the second. Davis scored 
Ihree more runs - one of which 
came off an RBI double by Aggie 
center-fielder Mall Zumstein. 
already the third RBI double by 
UC Davis in the game. 

Hope shed its Iighl on the field 
for the Trilons briefly when reliev-
er Brian Hinson entered the game 
and calmed Ihings down in Ihe top 
of the fourth. Hinson took over the 
dUlies on the mound after a shaky 
outing by Gherini in which Ihe 
Aggies ruffed up the starter for I I 
runs and 12 hits. 

Wilh the aflemoon gloom turn-
ing inlo a misl. UCSD's bats hf!3t-
cd up in the bottom of the fiflh 
when designaled hiller Jess 
Warrington popped a single into 
center. 

Wilh Warrington running, the 
next baller, second-baseman 
Kennith Fluharty. hit a roller up the 
middle just past the outstretched 
glove of the shortstop. Warrington 
advanced to third and then 
Waymon Howze knocked him In 
with a double to right center. 

In Sunday's game. UCSD suf-
fered some lapses defensively with 
partially fielded ground balls and 
misjudged Aggie hits to the out-
field that never led 10 pulouts for 
UCSD. The brunt of the biowoul. 
however. was inflicted by Davis' 
hilling which UCSD was not able 
to malch. 

On Saturday. UCSD could not 
keep up with the Aggics' offensive 
prowess. The Tritons could only 
bring home 3 runs, while Davis 
compiled 16 runs en route to its 16-
3 win. 

Friday's game was the exact 
Opposile of Salurday's and 
Sunday's gloomy play. II was 
greal. Eddie Ishak pitched six ter-

. rilic innings surrendering only 
three hits and striking out fi ve. 
while his leam scored 17 runs -
nine of which came in the fourth 
inning. 

In the fourth, Brian Terrell hit a 
three-run homerun and pinch-hit-
ter David Myen and Hill drove in 
runs wilh the bases loaded. Steve 
Pelletier and Terrell bolh walked 
to drive in runs as well in the 
inning. UCSD also grabbed three 
runs earlier in the third with back-
to-back-Io-back doubles . by 
Thorpe, Schramm and Fluhany, 
respectively. Ryan Hill went 3 for 
4 and Terrell went 2 for 5 wilh 4 
RBI's. In addition. Thorpe went 2 
for 2 wilh two runs scored and a 
homer. 

"I hate to throw a cliche in 
there. but this is a character-build-
ing weekend." O'Brien said. "[Bul] 
there's a 101 of baseball left." 

The Tritons' next matchup is on 
the road against Cal Baptist on 
Thursday, Feb. II .

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS 15 

Trouble-Free at UCSB 
SWEEP: The Tritons breezed by UCLA~ USC and UCSB on Saturday 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

When most people think of 
sword fighls they think of Inigo 
Montoya - Ihe guy in "The 
Princess Bride" - who sought 
to avenge his father's 
death against the six-fin-
gered man. 
Then there's 
Antonio 
Banderas in 
"The Mask 
of Zorro." But more 
importantly - and closer to 
home - there is the real-life 
sword fighters: the men and 
women of the UCSD fencing 
team. 

This weekend the Tritons trav-
eled up the coast for their first 
match since the end of November: 
a four-team jousl hosted by UC 
Santa . Barbara. Joining the 
Gauchos and the Tritons in last 
Saturday'S event were USC and 
UCLA. 

If the Tritons were intimidated 
by these schools' Division I sta-
tus, they didn'l show il. The 
Tritons were stoic and Ihey han-
dled Ihe Trojans, the Brvins and 
the Gauchos with lillie hesilation 
as they went on to take the overall 
victory. 

Wilhin the competition, there 
are three separale events: foil, 
epee and saber. The men compete 
in all the events. while the women 
compete in just two of them: epee

and saber. 
The Tritons gave the Trojans 

quile a beating. They won every 
single evenl. 

"That was the first time we've 
ever swept USC," Head Coach 

Stuart Lee said. 
. From there, the 

Tritons 
continued 

to reign as 
UCLA and UCSB 

both fell victim to UCSD. 
Against these two schools. 

UCSD's only loss came in 
women's foil. 

The men. however. did win in 
foil, and the overall victory of the 
men was surprising 10 Lee. 

"I didn't expect to win every-
thing in men's foil," Lee said. 
"That was a major surprise for us. 
Everyone fenced well." 

Highlighting UCSD's overall 
win were five fencers who were 
undefeated on the day, 

Junior Ted Pagill. who fin-
ished in 16th place in foil last 
year at Nationals, continued 
where he left off: with a string of 
wins. Though he dominaled foil 
last year, Pagill is competing in 
saber this year. 

"He's in contention to go to 
Nationals," Lee said. "He is so 
capable of crossing over [from 
foil to saber] which is exception-
aL" 

Senior Peter Graham also had 
a stellar day as he was unbeaten in 

the men's saber competition. 
UCSD freshman and men 's 

foil team captain Wess Balanca, 
finished the day without losing in 
men's foil competition. Though 
this is his first season at the col-
lege level, Lee said that he seems 
like a veteran. 

"Even though he's a freshman. 
he had the leadership quality to 
lead the squad," Lee said. 
"They've done really well ." 

The women's side also boasted 
some stellar play. 

Last year's foil captain Julia 
Kulla-Mader. now competing in 
epee. went undefeated. 

"She really was dominating 
[on Saturday]," Lee said. 

The squad's next competition 
is a tri-meet in Pasadena where it 
will face Cal Tech and Cal State 
Fullerton. The Tritons have 
already beaten Cal Tech this 
year, but failed to get by 
Fullerton. 

This time. however. Lee is 
confident that the Tritons will take 
down Fu"enon. 

"1 bet the Fullerton coach that 
we were going to win the next 
match," Lee said. "I'm pushing 
the team to follow through on my 
threat!" 

A victory against Fullerton. 
Lee said, wi" depend on the per-
formance from Ihe women's 
squad. 

"I see the women's foil team as 
the key to the win."

Tritons in MPSF Turmoil 
BREAKDOWN: UCSD struggled Friday against UC Santa Barbara 
By Jak. Gordon 
Sports Editor 

Losing sucks. No mailer how it _ 
happens, losing is never beller 
than winning. Bealing up on some 
hapless opponent by only 

to win every single game. Similar 
10 many of ils matches this year, 
UCSD _wenl down early and 
clawed its way back, only to come 
up just short. 

playing average always .................. 
"We played a good 
match," senior seller 

K u r t 
Seckinglon 
~;.;:;:;;:w;::.::~~ said. "We were 

feels beller then 
playing your 
beSI and barely 
losing to a wonhy foe. 

Unfonunately, the 
UCSD men 's volleyball team 
never gets such a luxury. As a 
result of Iheir inclusion in the 
Mounlain Pacific Sports 
Federalion (MPSF), UCSD plays 
all the lOp squads in Ihe nation 
such as Division I Stanford, BYU. 
Hawaii and UCLA. These MPSF 
games are seemingly unwinnable 
for a Division III program with no 
athletic scholarships, yet the 
Tritons persevere. 

True to lorm. UCSD showed 
heart and toughness playing one 
of its best MPSF matches to dale, 
but still lost to No. IS University 
of California, Sanla Barbara, 15-
10, 15-10. 15-8. 

So far this season, UCSD has 
played ' two non-conference 
matches and won them both. Yet, 
their 0-6 start in conference play 
gives them the unfonunate record 
of 2-7. This record is misleading 
bcl:ause UCSD has a stellar squad 
for their position in the NCAA. 
Ranked as the No. 2 program in 
Division 111, the Tritons have a 
chance to make waves in the post-
season, if they don' l letlhe losses 
to the volleyball superpowers get 
them down. 

The UCSB Gauchos were 
ranked No. 15 in the latest NCAA 
poll , yet the Tritons had a chance 

definitely in all the 
games. We got down 

early, but played really well 
Ihrough the middle and Ihen just 
couldn't finish it up." 

Seckington played excellently 
in the bailie with Ihe Gauchos, 
recording SO assists and 5 digs. 
Senior middle blocker Devon 
Jeffcoal and sophomore outside 
hillers Zack Hite and Ben Vernon 
led the charge for UCSD. Jeffcoat. 
the Triton's big presence in the 
middle, led the team with a .550 
hitting percentage, connecting on 
14 of 20 attacks. Hile and Vernon 
had even more opponunilies, 39 
for each and they combined for 27 
ki lis. Staners Kaeo Griffin and 
Bill Sinclair also combined for J 4 
kills. 

The Trilons' defense i6 whal 
kept them in'lhe match. Hite led 
the Tritons with a team-best 8 
digs with Griffin and Vernon 
recording 6 each. Up fronl, 
Jeffcoal added 3 blocks while 
assisting on 4 more. 

Overall, the Tritons hung 
tough with UCSB for each match, 
but they could not get Ihe offense 
when Ihey needed it. UCSB 
stepped up its defense at crucial 
moments, lallying 20 blocks to 
UCSD's 10. 

The loss pUI UCSD's ",cord to 
2-8, but the confidence gained 

against the Gauchos should be 
helpful for the coming weeks. 
f'Our of the next six games for the 
Trilons are non-conference, twice 
the amount Ihey have played so 
far. 

"We've got matches coming up 
against teams like Cal Baptisl and 
La Verne," Scckington said. ''This 
is going (10 be) a big stand with a 
lot of teams we have a good 
chance of beating. We should do 
well." 

Before the Tritons reach that 
stretch of Division III competi-
tion, Ihey have one more hurtle to 
jump: the UCLA Bruin squad, 
ranked No.4 in the latest NCAA 
poll. UCSD plays UCLA on 
Saturday, Feb. 13 at home in 
RIMAC Arena. 

Though Ihe Tritons will be 
looking to gear up for Ihose easier 
Division III leams, playing lots of 
games against Ihe loughest com-
petition has ils benefils. The high 
level of play helps the Trilons 
hone Iheir skills against the best in 
the nation. A more exciling bene-
fit perhaps is the fact that every 
malch againsl a high-ranked team 
is a chance 10 make major UCSD 
sports history. 

When UCSD beals UCLA, 
where will you be'! Come on out 
to RIMAC Arena next Salurday at 
8 p.m. to see if this lime's Ihe 
charm.

HOOPS: 
UCSD dominates 
tJCSC in the paint 
c ......... ".. .... . 

Sophomores Genevieve RuvaJd 
and Kim "Shaquille" Neal were 
crashing the boards and dropping 
in buckets all nighl against the 
Slugs. The duo combined for 9 
rebounds, and also registered the 
most points for UCSD. Ruvald was 
the top-scorer with 16 points, fol-
lowed by "Shaq" who hroughl 
home I I points. 

Ruvald's leam-besl 16 points 
were nOl surprising to senior guard 
Jenessa Bayda. 

"The pasltwo games she's been 
all over iI," Bayda said. 

Ruvald was on fire Friday nighl 
against the Hawks as she broughl 
down II boards, and chalked up 
17 points. Neal was also a power-
house on Friday nighl, jusl as she 
was on Salurday. The - center 
scored 10 points and grabbed 4 
rebounds. 

"She was on tonight," senior 
guard Amy McClure said of Neal's 
play againsl Santa Cruz. "When 
Kim's on I can go 10 her every 
time." 

Saturday night's Sanla Cruz 
win marked UCSD's second win in 
as many days. On Friday night, the 
Trilons slaged an incredible come-
from-behind overtime win in EI 
Cajon againsl Christian Heritage. 

Senior guard Trislen Teasdale's 
19 points, including a lasl-minute 
game-tying Ihree-pointer, were key 
to the Trilons' victory. 

"Trislen gOI in a zone and hil 
some key shots and key free-
throws in overtime," Bayda said. 

Like always, however, the 
Tritons did nol pUI all of their pres-
sure on their starters. Thiny of 
UCSD's 72 poinls came from Ihe 
bench. 

''The second string came out 

Monday, February 8, 1999 

and pulled us back into the game," 
Bayda said. 

With fewtr than six minutes 
remaining, the Tritons were down 
by as much as II points_ But 
UCSD,led by Teasdale's late game 
heroics, slepped up, taking the 
game into overtime where they 
eventually won_ 

"It was our biggesl win of the 
year, because we're in a can't lose 
situation," Bayda said. 

This weekend's pair of wins 
improves the Tritons' record to I6-S 
on the season, including an impres-
sive ninc-game wiMing streak, dat-
ing back to Jan. I. The Tritons have 
four remaining regular season 
games, three of which are home-
games. If the Tritons win three of 
these, they will most likely cam 
themselves a spot in the postseason. 

The Tritons have this week to 
rest up and prepare for Friday 
night's home match against 
Chapman al 7 p.m. When the 
Tritons lasl played Chapman it was 
a pretty ugly affair - UCSD won 
by 27 points, 71-44. Ho hum.

Blue and Gold-Records 
FAIT: 27 records are broken during the annual Blue-Gold 
., .............. 
Senior Sta" Wrltltf 

Here in San Diego, when a young mao's 
thoughts tum to love and the warm sun 
gives way to gentle rain, it signali the end of 
one season and the beginning of a new one. 
In this case, the end of cross country and the 
beginning of track and field season. 

This weekend at RIMAC field the 
Tritons staned their season off with the UC 
San Diego Annual Blue-Gold meet. This 
was a chance tor former Tritons 10 compete 
and show lheir stuff one more time. II was 
also a chance for current Tritons to show-
case the effects of their hard ofT-season 
workouts and to stan the seasOn with a 
bang. 

This year's squad got off 10 a fantastic 
stan, as the alumni gave the Tritons a run 
for their money, pushing the team to 27 
meel records and a number of personal 
records. Among the top performances of 
the day was the school record run by Jim 
Freeman, who ran the I 10 high hurdles in 
14.7 seconds, 

Another top performer was senior runner 
Maggie Dwire, whose 2:23.2 I time in the 
800-meters set a meet record. 

"Everyone ran prelly well (Saturday]," 
Dwire said. "We're used to competing with 
each other, not against. But everyone gave a 
good elTon." 

Senior Meghan ScOll, who ran the 3200-
meters in a meet record time of I I : 16.91!, 
said that this competition was a great warm 
up for the team_ 

''This meet was a good chance for Ihe 
team to work out the kinks," SCOll said. "II 

was a great way to warm up before the sea-
son." 

The men's team also gOl a good effon 
from sophomore James Nielsen. who ran a 
meet record time of 9: 16.25 on his way to 
victory in the 3200-rnelers. 

The throwing team also had a strong 
showing Saturday. The men were led by the 
strong performances of seniors Mall Seefeld 
and Chris Swanz. 

Seefeld set a meet record in the shOl put 
with an impressive throw of I S.21! melers 
and also won the discus event wilh a mark 
of 4 I .36 meters. Swanz set a meet record in 
the javelin with a throw of 49.5 meters. 

Also having a good day for the Ihrowing 
team was senior Dan Paredes, who threw a 
personal best 48.S8 meters in the javelin. 

"Our whole throwing team had a good 
day," Swartz said. "MatI, Dan and I all 
threw really well. I think this team has a 101 
of potential and a good chance to win con-
ference." 

This competition was more an exhibilion 
than an actual meet. The season really gets 
started next week when the Tritons travel 10 
Point Loma lor their first interschool com-
petition. The Tritons are solid throughout, 
and the team is confidenl thaI Ihe season 
will be a successful one. 

"We have a good chance to win confer-
ence," Dwire said. "Our leam has a lot of 
depth and some talent." 

Scott shared Dwire's senliments aboul 
the strength of the leam. 

"This is Ihe strongest team we've had 
since I've been here," SCOII said. "We have 
a 101 of people with high goals this year."

one of the most beautiful praces in 
the world: Hawaii . 

The bad news is thaI 
Ihe University of Hawaii 
is ranked No. 4 in the 
nation and took both games it 
played against the Trilons, 17-6 and 
14-4. 

Head Coach Denny Harper led his 
Tritons inlo the Duke Kahanamoko Aquatic 
Complex last Thursday hoping for the 
upset. However, UCSD came oUI nat. The 
Tritons were not up to the challenge of bal-
Iling the higher-ranked Rainbows. By Ihe 
time Ihe dust sellled, Hawaii led at Ihe end 
of the first period, 6-0. 

The firsl quaner was a definite wake-up 
call for the Tritons, as they knew they could 
play beller than their opening-stanza deba-
cle. The Tritons came out firing in the next 
quarter and tried to scrape their way back 
inlo the game. 

Freshman Emma Kudritzki finally broke 
UCSD's silence with a goal midway 
through Ihe period. That goal gave the 
Trilons some confidence and they began to 
swim with the Rainbows. 

The Tritons scored again with less than 
four minutes remaining, as super-soph 
Salem beat the Hawaii goalie. However, 
HawaiI answered wilh a quick goal 10 close 
oUllhe half. 

In Ihe third quaner . UCSD was out-
played, despite the lillie wave of momentum 

it had created. In the founh period, Ihough, 
Hammerly scored two goals, and Megan 
Wallis chipped in with another. Kudritzki 
also notched her second goal of Ihe contest 
in the founh, but it wasn' t enough as the 
Tritons fell , 17-6. 

In the second game, the Tritons came out 
lighling. They were not happy about 

Ihe previous loss, and they wanted 
to do something about it. 
They ballled the 
Rainbows on both ends 

of the pool, never giving up any-
thing easily. The Tritons also began 10 

shoot more, something they did not do in 
the first contes\. 

Though UCSD was shooting more, the 
shots were still not falling . Fortunately, 
Hawaii could manage only two goals, and 
the Tritons entered the second quaner wilh 
confidence, knowing that they were not too 
far behind. 

The Trilons played well in the second, as 
Ihe game was quickly turning into a defen-
sive struggle. Salem was the one who final -
ly got the Tritons on Ihe board, after an early 
Rainbow goal. But the Rainbows quickly 
answered, eXlending their lead to 4-1, and 
thaI's how the score would stay going into 
the half. 

The third quaner was one Harper and the 
Trilons would like to forgel. They came out 
Ilat again and gave up 6 points. 

Now down 10-2, UCSD was angry 
again. The Tritons came out in the founh 
quarter and fought the Rainbows for every 
ball. However, in the end Hawaii defeated 
the Tritons, 14-4. 

The road trip was a learning experience 
lor Harper's troops, who will try to put their 
knowledge to good use in the next malch.
