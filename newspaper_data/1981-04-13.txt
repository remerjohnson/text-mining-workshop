BY LISA SULLIVAN 
and WILLIAM HAMILTON 

UCSD' rape epidemic didn't just happen between police and some campus 
overnight. As we have learned during the organization could provide the detail such

C()lllllll\llt,ll"' 

Realizing this, several groups on campus, 
including the Campus Police, the Rape 
Prevention Education Program, the 
California State Employees Association and 
Counseling and Psychological Services, 
have stepped up efforts to deal with the 
problem. 

In addition, an 'emergency' meeting was 
organized on March 31 by conct:rned 
members of the Philosophy Department to 
define the rape problem and discuss possible 
measures that could be taken to increase 
security. 

At i sue were: the role of campus police, 
the feasibility of resuming an escort service, 
problems with campus lighting, the need for 
free self-defense courses and the services 
available at Counseling and Psychological 
Services and the Rape Prevention Education 
Program. 

Campus Police Chief Hugh French said 
that hi department i reacting with "fear 
and apprehension" to the crisis and that 
efforts have been made to alert the campus 
community. 

Such efforts have included a seminar 
entitled "Security for Women" which was 
held during spring break, a notice of alert 
issued by French which was to be posted 
around campu , and a presentation by 
detective Clark Martin at an emergency 
meeting organized by the Philosophy 
Department on March 31. 

At the emergency meeting, Clark 
explained that the prtvacy right of rape 
victims prevent the campu police from 
publicly di closing report of crime unless 
a ked. 

"If a rape victim asks the campu police 
not to pulicize the report, the police 
department will not di clo e the detail of 
the incident," he said . 

While protecting the privacy right of 
rape victim in under tandable given their 

nsitive, emotional ituation, we believe 
that a line of commu nication e tabli hed 

. which suffers from limited enrollment 
capacity and co t enrollee. Additionally, 
the CSEA has approached the Chancellor s 
office to approve a system whereby faculty 
and staff would be permitted mid·day leave 
in order to attend. 

RPEP is part of a UC systemwide program 
which will be discontinued May 31 unless 
each UC campus continues the program 
with independent funds. 

Joan Koerper, head of the program here, 
says she would like to see RPEP continue at 
UCSD next year, but she is uncertain ' 
whether funding can be secured . The 
Regi tration Fee Committee will be asked 
for $4,000, she said, and supplementary 
funds may be requested by Vice Chancellor 
of Busine s and Financial Management 
Herm Johnson. 

But some campus official have criticized 
RPEP. 

'It's a terrible program," said one official 
who requested anonymity. "I think we 
ought to have a program like RPEP but not 
under Joan Koerper. Joan is not doing her 
job. " 

And Koerper herself admits that she has 
been unable to keep regular office hours due 
to "varyin~ commitment" which she 
refused to dlscu . 

However, Koerper feel s that it is not 
RPEP's duty to provide regular office hours 
or a 24 hour hotline. "It's not set up to be a 
crisis-intervention center; it wa not set up 
to meet everyone's need . It was designed as 
a prevention and education program," he 
said. 

Koerper defined RPEP a ' a "unique 
program" designed primarily to address the 
issue of acquaintance-rape which he says is 
the mo t pre ing problems on this campus. 

Salarie and benefits constitute over three 
Quarters of RPEP' $11,000 budget. We feel 
that thi i an exorbitant proportion, given 
the organization' work done to date, and 
believe that offering academic credit to 
volunteer taffing the program would 
liberate more fund for con tructiv us . 

RPEP' self-defense clas is a token 
program, given it enrollment limitations. 
RPEP ha on i tently failed to publicize it

charge Thllrsday against Jon Bekken , a UCSD 
communications major and new indicator ~taff member, .for 
pu bli hing a list of this year's confidential telephone credit card 
code number in the ni' February 3 i ue. 

Deputy City ' Attorney Ted Bromfield pre ed charges 
against Bekken for violating 
California Penal Code ection 
502.7, which states that it is a 
mi demeanor to publish , use, 
or distribute, with the intent 
to defraud the phone 
company, telephone or 
telegraph codes which could 
be used to avoid payment of 
lawful telephone toll charge . 

In it February 3 issue, the 
new indicator printed a full 
page entitled "'81 Bell Tel 
Credit Card Code!!" 

On the page was listed over 
200 RAO (revenue account-
ing office) credit card codes, 
a well as 'check digits' 
which verify the number's 
validity to the operator. The 
page, which was reprinted 
from Overthrow Magazine, a 
New York City journal, 
encourages 'bandit dialing' 
sttlting, "If you are on the 
move in revolution, use your 
liberated credit card as your

efficient to give the operator 
your card number while it is 
at the expense of the ruling 
class." -

Disgusting behavior displayed at movie 

Editor: 
We are writing to expre 

our outrage and disgust 
concerning our experience at 
the showing of the x-rated 
movie, Bel A mi, last Tuesday 
night. Attending out of 
curiosity, we were immedi-
ately sensitized by the 
crowd's behavior before the 
film started _ Within five 
minutes after we sat down, 
we witnessed an extraordin-
ary exhibition of contagiou 
agression. Newspapers were 
trewn all over the center 

section of the room (USB 
2722) to be used as 
ammunition for a paper-wad 
melee that was totally 
childish and irrespon ible 
(the trash was left for other ). 
For the women among us, it 
was frightening to see thi 
audience composed of 99 
percent young males 
apparently manifesting their 
frustrated libidos in a violent 
way, foreboding their 
reaction to the film . As soon 
as the movie started, all of 
our worst fears were 
confirmed. 

The sexual activity in the 
movie brought out the most 
sexist and violent behaviors 
possible. The women were 
protrayed as toys of pleasure 
for the "star," Harry Reems. 
Sex was portrayed as an 
activity devoid of any 
emotional or relational 
content, and thus was 
lowered to the most bestial of 
levels. This bestiality seemed 
to further excite most of the 
men in the audience. The 

blatant encouragement 
which the crowd afforded to 
this disrespectful behavior 
made us all feel angry and 
disgu ted. 

The audence di played all 
type of decadent behavior; 
many of them yelled 
obscenitie and eemed in 
competition with each other 
to degrade the women; they 
joked about the exploitation 
of sex; they described the 
penis as a weapon again t 
women ("don't waste your 
bullets, Harry". "shoot her in 
the eye"); and threw paper 
wad at women who e 
sexualtiy or appearance theX 
deemed "not good enough ' 
for Harry. 

One of the most iIIu trative 
a peel of all of this was the 
identification of members of 
the audience with Harry. 
Many of those present 
seemed to be putting 
themselves in his place. 
Consequently, the deport-
ment of the audience became 
totally uninhibited and we 
were sad witnesses to the 
total exposure of the lowe t 
forms of social conscious-
ness. The audience showed 
absolutely no respect tor 
women as people; on the 
contrary , they heartily 
condoned the exploitation of 
women as objects to be used 
or abused as the consumer 
desired. This is undoubtedly 
the type of media and social 
communication that advan-
ces the forces of sexism and 
violence against women and 
culminates most abhorrently 

Communication gap 
Editor: 

We have found a crucial 
error (by Assistant Chancel· 
lor Pat Ledden) in the 
Guardian's interview of 
Chancellor Atkinson (GllQrd-
ion, March 9). This error 
deals with the Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs Search Committee 
and we feel the students 
should be told the truth about 
the matter. 

Dr. Ledden's statement to 
Dr. Atkinson, as printed in 
the Guardian, was "the 
selection of students (for the 
search committee) was based 
on the commitment that they 
discuss deliberations of the 
committee .... " The fact is 
that Dr . Atkinson was 
misinformed and Dr, Ledden 
was blatantly wrong. 

We did the interviewing for 
the VCUA Search Committee 
student applicants and we 
feel the need to clarify some 
is ues. 

We certainly did ask all the 
applicants how they felt 
about disclosing information, 
we don't deny that. Our 
reason for asking this 
question is that information 
disclosure wa an important 
is ue during last year's 
chancellor earch proce s. 
However, in no way wa the 

applicant's answer tp this 
concern criteria for selection. 
In actuality, we were very 
hesitant toward those 
responses which suggested 
immediate discJos\.lre of 
information. When told this, 
Dr. Ledden responded, "I was 
mistaken," without any 
apparent remorse for his 
error, not even, ''I'm sorry, I 
was mistaken ." 

Apparently Dr. Ledden 
feels that if a leak occurs it 
will be caused by a student, 
even though last year's 
chancellor search leak was 
caused by a faculty m~mber. 
I t seems to us t hat Dr. Ledden 
and perhaps others are being 
unfair to studel'lts by 
spreading hearsay informa-
tIOn which may turn out to be 
false. If there is a desire to 
obtain a workable relation-
ship between the students 
and the administration, this 
is sure a hell-of-a-way to go 
about it. 

Chancellor Atkinson was 
told the correct information 
at the Chancellor' Forum on 
March 20. We wanted to 
inform the Asso-ciated 
Student Body at UCSD.

A our disgu t wa being 

fueled by the cu ltural 
decadence and exi t violence 
of the audience, the final 
traw wa broken when a 

Black woman appeared on 
the . creen and was met by a 
round of boo (t hey 
apparently didn't want 
Harry to be educed by her) 
and many racist, exist 
comments (e.g .. jungle 
bunny). At that point our 
tolerance wa gone-we 
promptly got up and walked 
out. The total lack of rep_eet 
for women ex pre ed by the 
film and the crowd. the lack 
of re pect for love, and the 
expres ion of the most 
violent and gross violations 
of personhood were unbear-
able. 

Of course. someone made 
money off of this spectacle of 
ba eness, thi propagation of 
exist, raci t violent culture. 

Who is responsible? Which 
group organized the showing 

of thi film? Maybe thi paper 
can tell u . . We demand that 
all of tho e people who 
attended this movie think 
about the con ciousne 
manifested there-and then 
think again about their 
feeling toward it. We must 
under tand that thi type of 
movie and the crowd ' 
reaction promote sex ist 
oppres ion and train the 
relation of people with 
people by negating love, 
respect and hope for 
improving the ocial 
condition under which we 
all ufter. 

Thi \Va no harmle 
entertainment for a predom-
inantly young male crowd. 
Thi wa propaganda that 
play upon and exploits the 
mo t repugnant aspects of 
male exi m. We must also be 
aware that exism is a strong 
economic tool (as seen in 
lower wages for women and 
job exclu ion) that is used by 
the economically elite cia s 

that exploits a large portion 
of ociety a well as women. 
In that ense, we should be 
aware that sexism and thi s 
type of media propagation of 
it co ntribute to the 
consciou ne that allow 
the dehumanization of people 
to flouri h and condone 
exploilive relation among 
people. 

One way to fight back 
again t this injust ice is to 
alert others to the misuse of 
med ia whi ch propagater 
disgusting and destructi ve 
reaction such a tho e that 
we witnes ed . Another way 
is to boycott thi type f film 
Our hope i to mak e

'Guardian' coverage of crew 
classic leaves some to be desired 
Editor: 

Reading the results of the 
San Diego Crew Classic last 
Sunday in the LA Times and 
the San Diego Union was not 
plea ant for a UCSD crew 
member. The Times carried a 
picture of the SDSU 
lightweight crew (our cross 
town rivals whom we beat) 
and failed to mention the 
UCSD crew even once. The 
San Diqo Union talked of our 
crew very briefly. With 
Monday came the hope that 
our own Guardian would join 
us in ce lebrating our 
triumphs. 

Instead, on the cover of the 
sports section was a picture 
of the Washington crew at 
the finish of the Copley Cup. 
The article that followed 
neither gave the appropriate 
acknowledgment of the 
success of the UCSD crew on 
that day nor was accurate. 
After reading the paper a 
question came to my mmd; if 
our own school paper is not 
going to back the UCSD 
sports program, nor take the 
time to get the facts straight, 
who will? 

The photograph of the 
University of Washington 
crew celebrating their 
victory was excellent. Yet 
where was the photographer 
when the UCSD Iightwei~ht 
women crossed the finish hne 
to win oneof the biggest races 
of the season? Beneath your 
picture the caption interest-
mgly enough read: "About 
25,000 spectators turned out 
to watch the Huskies beat 
UCSD and 38 other teams to 
win the Copley Cup ... " when 
UCSD did not even compete 
for the Copley cup, which is 
the di vision for the men's 
Varsity (heavyweig h t) 
'eight.' Our Varsity men 
competed instead in a 'four' 
(racing shell for four men and 
a coxswain) and just missed 
reaching the finals in a heat 
that included the top name 
Ivy league schools. This was 
a fact you failed to mention 
altogether. The UCSD men's 
lightweight 'eight' (160 Ills. 
and under with the average 
at 155 Ibs.), besides placing 
second in their heat and fifth 
overall, beat every other 
school in California, putting 

them in contention to win 
both theCityChampionships 
and the Western Sprints. 
This was also not included in 
your article. 

Being a coxswain for the 
UCSD women's crew, this 
article in particular is a 
disappointment. As an 
athlete representing a school, 
one would at least expect to 
be recognized by its paper. 
This story is Just one of 
many, however, In which The 
Guardian has failed to use its 
enormous power to generate 
the school spirit needed to 
energize the UCSD sport's 
program. If. putting a pIcture 
of one of · our crews on the 
cover of the sport's section 
and writing a favorable 
article is bias, then be bias. 
We have the potential for an 
athletic program unmatched 
by any school in our league as 
proven by the acomplish-
ments of our crew. But it 
takes the support of the 
people of UCSD and that of 
The GllQrdion. If it doesn't 
come from us, where else will 
we get it?

Welcome to EI Salvador 
B Y JONATH AN GRUDIN 
EI Salvador was a welcome 

relief. 
True, the border officials 

had extracted anum ber of 
small "fees" which show up 
in no travel guide, but that 
was fairly standard. In 
contrast, the Guatemalan 
National Guard liked to 
gather in groups of about half 
a score and wave tourists off 
the road with their rifles . Not 
content with normal military 
and police duties, they 
engaged me in a leisurely 
argument over an equitable 
distribution of certain 
material property-my 
money. I wa attached to it, 
and they wanted some. Their 
argument always began 
persuasively, when the 
fellow with the submachine 
gun placed my documents-

registration-in his pocket. It 
wou ld play dumb as he listed 
my trans~ressions, such as 
driving WIthout a shirt on, or 
having no fire extinguisher in 
my car. The end was always 
the same, reached in a spirit 
of cheerful pan-american 
compromise-I kept most of 
my money, and they took 
some. Once I watched as a 
uniformed guardsman, 
osten ibly searching my 
trunk for contraband, slipped 
a can of soup and a bar of soap 
into his pockets. 

I was glad to have 
Guatemala behind me. 
Although small and realtive-
Iy populous, EI Salvador is an 
attractive arrangement of 
tropical rainforests and 
mountains, some of the latter 
verdant, others stark cinder 
cones. Perhaps because San 
Salvador is near the coast, 
the capital seemed European 
in oontrast to the larger, 
inland, high·a1titude cities of 

Mexico and Guatemala. Ona 
arriving in San Salvador, I 
found a place to park and 
stood by my car, watching 
the crowds . My first 
observation was that ice-
cream cones are popular on 
warm Sunday afternoons in . 
the city. 

A piercing, bird·like cry 
from a few feet away startled 
me. I looked down and 
discovered an indescribably 
filthy, obviously malnour-
ished small boy. He watched 
me expressionlessly, one 
cuppei hand outstretched. 
As I s red in horror, he let 
out th same shrill, animal· 
like c . It mayor may not 
have been the word 
"Quiero." 

I didn't move. Without any 
change of expression, the boy 
stepped to the car next to 
mine and urinated, briefly, on 
the door. I watched it drip 
from the car into the dust , 
then looked back at him.

Tenure simply means: 

power, job security, academic 
prestige, and finally, a voice 
within the academjc/ bureau-
cratic circles of this 
university - a voice that can 
assist or hinder the progress 
of Chicano, Blacks, Native 
American , and Asians in 
this community a well a

No one in this world has a 

monopoly on virtue, but it 
seems that the debate over 
who is supplying arms to the 
guerrillas in EI Salvador 
overlooks the fact that the 
guerrilla are the good 
guys-or at least the better 
guys. Nor does all of their 
support have inister origin 
in the Eastern Hemisphere-

I've given money to the 
revolutionaries in EI 
Salvador, and I would not be 
sorry if it went to buy arms. 

And what if the future 
government of EI Salvador 
has ties to Cuba? Several 
years after my visit, a friend 
called and invited me to 
travel to Cuba with her. It 
turns out anyone can go 
there. If you go, you will see 
that Cuba is not without 
defect. But you will also see 
that in Cuba, every child has 
the opportunity to grow up 
with dignity and self-respect. 
That has to count for 
something. 

The criteria for the 
granting of tenure are: any 
professor must be employed 
by the university no less than 
the contractual period for 
tenure to be reviewed by a 
secret committee and the 
chairperson of that depart-
ment; the professor's 
scholarly work must be

Several months ago, data 
was presented at a Student 
Affirmative Action Commit-
tee General As embly by a 
tenured professor regarding 
the subject of Third World 
professors and their 
struggles to reeeive tenure at 
this institution . It was 
alarming to find out that in 
the history of this university, 
we have lost 22 professors of 
color through this process. 

J'he professors -we have 
10 t in the past represented 
various fields that could 
benefit the struggle of Third 
World people - math , 
':;lemistry, history, psycho-
logy, and drama. The few 
that remain have a dim 
outlook on their chances of 
receiving tenure. Some of 
them are actually preparing 
to leave UCSD. 

The question we need to 
ask ourselves is: who will be 
next? They, like u , are 
decreasing in numbers every 
year. We are the only ones 
that can bring a stop to this 
form of oppression. If we 

. don 't unite now in struggle, 
we might a well accept our 
fate and let things continue 
as they are.

Election 
violations 
surface 

Before the campaign for ' 
the upcoming AS election 
was two day' old, the AS 
Elections Commission had 
two candidates to deal 
with. 

The Commission , 
formed by AS Election 
Commissioner Melissa 
Ligman, handles all cases 
of Election Code viola-
tions, which may include 
illegal posting or overex· 
penditures. 

"In this case, the slates 
of presidential con tenders 
Jules Bagneris and Josh 
Harris were the subject of 
complaints filed by other 
ca nd idates," said AS 
Advisor Randy Woodard. I 

T he complaint against 
Bagneris "had somethinK 
to do with finances. 
Contrary to the policy of 
former Elections Commis· 
sioners, Ligman refused to 
release the details of either 
case, arguing t hat "it isn't 
fa i r to the p eop l e 
running." 

The Student Slate on 
which Harris is running 
"posted two fliers on the 
same bulletin board," 
Woodard said. 

Both candidates re-
ceived warnings from the 
Commission. 

A presidential forum 
will be held April 20, from 
12 noon to 1 pm on the 
Main Gym steps.

AS will s tage constitutional 
convention open to students 

Shakeup could affect next year's AS 
conlilltlcd (rom page 1 
Welfare Reggie Williams, who believe a 
change in the structure of the current AS is 
sorely needed, su bmitted a new constitution to 
the AS Council for approval, hoping it would 
be put up for a student vote. 

When the Council rejected his con titution, 
which is a bicameral y tern of government 
with no president, William proposed a 
con titutional convention. 

What wa eventua11y passed was a "non-
binding constitutional workshop, ba ically 
useless," said Wi11iams. 

The AS showed no signs of scheduling such 
a workshop, and as two other council 
members - Vice President Warren Wheeler 
and President Bill Topkis - came up with 
constitutions of their own, the Council 
reconsidered the idea of a convention. 

The proposal was passed at the April 1 
meeting, 15-3·1. 

Two of those voting against the convention 
- Josh Harris and Mitch Sosna - are running 
for president. 

Both Sosna and Harris believe the problem 
with the AS is not a fault of its structure, but 
of the individuals running the government. 

"I don't care what model of government you 
put in there, it won't work unless you get the 
right person in the right office," says Harris . 
"With the co·op structure, whoever had the 
mo t support at the meetings got his way. 
That's what this convention will be like. The 
strongest special interest group will win ." 

Sosna too, feels "the argument that it's a 
structural problem is bulls hit. It's the 
individuals in there." 

And AS Elections Commissioner Melissa 
Ligman, who also opposed the convention , 
says "it's not fair to do this to the people 
running for office. 

"Two of the constitutions now being 
discussed (Wheeler's and Williams') have no 
place for presidents," she said. "That just 

isn 't right to do to those running for that 
offi e. " 

" Although the rule governing a 
con titutional convention are nebulou even 
to A officia l . should a new form of 
~uvt!rnment be approved , it cou ld be 

'Implemented a soon a next fall ," Williams 
said. 

One fear supporters of the convention have 
is that tuclents at large will fail to show up 
and participate in the proceedings. 

"If the convention is dominated by AS-
types, it'll be a sham, it'll defeat the purpose, 
and I'll be disappointed ," said Williams. 

"This is a unique opportunity. Any student 
can play an equal role in restructuring their 
government, either by submitting their own 
proposal or voting on those presented by 
others," he said. 

AS members will have no advantage over 
other students at the convention. Each 
student will have one vote and an equal 
opportunity to present or di cu s problems 
with or po sible chan~es in government. 

The convention WIll be held Thursday, 
April 16, in TLH 107 at 5:00 pm. The room is 
booked for five hours, but should the 
convention extend past 10:00 pm, Topkis says 
it will continue.

A team of four Revelle College 
tudent narrowly defeated a 

faculty team from their college to 
take the championship in last 
Thursday night's all ·campus 
College Bowl competition. 

The Revelle team also defeated 
the student team from Muir in the 
finals, 23·22, scoring the deciding 
point in a split-second, sudden· 
death overtime period. The loss 
placed the Muir students second in 
the overall comnetition. 

A consolation playoff between 
Third and Warren College 
students for third and fourth place 
saw Third handily defeat Warren, 
12-9. 

Each round consisted of 50 
question on subjects ranging from 
space physics to sports trivia. Each 
correctly answered question was 
worth one point. The competition 
was patterned after the classic 
television show, General Electric's 
College Bowl. 

Members of the championship 
Revelle student team were Paul 
Beroza, David Eckmann, Ken 
Mayer and Gordon Howard. 

The Revelle faculty team, which 
won the all-campus faculty title 
last quarter, consisted of Assistant

Thompson, physics ' prof, 
receives Fulbright grant 

Money for teaching, research 
William Thompson, a professor 

of physics here, has been named to 
receive a Fulbright grant for 
university teaching and advanced 
research for 1981-82. 

Thompson, who joined the 
UCSD faculty in 1966, will lecture 
on the theory of relationship 
between wave generation and 
diffusion frocesses at the 
University 0 Innsbruck, Austria, 
from September 1981 to January 
1982. His award is one of more than 
500 Fulbright grants for teaching 
and research to be used in more 
than 100 countries during 1981 ·82. 

The awards were announced by 
the U.S. International Communi-
cation Agency and the Board of 
Foreign Scholarships. The purpose 
of the Fulbright Program, now in 
its 35th year, is "to enable the 
government of the United States to 
increase mutual understanding 
between the people of the United 

States and the people of other 
countries." 

Thompson recei ved a B.A. degree 
in physics and mathematics in 
1944 and a M.A. degree in physics 
in 1947 from the University of 
British Columbia, Vancouver. In 
1950 he received a Ph .D. in applied 
mathematics from the University 
of Toronto, Ontario. 

Thompson's career has been 
devoted to the development of the 
theory of plasma physics and its 
application in controlled 
thermnuclear research. He was the 
theoretical member of the small 
group that started thi research in 
England in 1950 - a group that 
finally developed into the Culham 
Laboratory for Controlled 
Thermonuclear Fusion. 

He served as professor of plasma 
physics at Oxford University for 
three years before joining the 
UCSD faculty .

'Posttnan' doesn't ring true 
in latest relllake of classic 

Bob Rafelson's The 
Postman Always Rings Twice 
is a symphony of waste and 
misunderstood talent. His 
remake of james M. Cain's 
classic 1930's novel had the 
potential, in stars, story and 
technical expertise, to be an 
exceptional film. The final 
result of his precise and 
offbeat storytelling, though, 
is surprisingly disappointing. 

Postman is a project 
Rafelson has been pursuing 
for 10 years, yet the result of 
the time, effort and thought 
put into the film is 
shockingly poor. Postman 
doesn't fall prey to hasty or 
slipshod work, but rather it is 
the victim of fundamental 
blunders in telling the story 
that cripple the film from the 
opening scene . 

David Mamet 's stark 
scri pt establishes the 
characters and sett ing 
immediately, introducing 
kFrank, the drifter Oack 
Nichol on), Nick Gohn 
Colicos), the owner of a 
roadside cafe-gas station and 
his wife Cora Oessica Lange), 
all in the desolate squalor of 
the Depres ion. jack decides 
to stay on at the cafe after 
cathing a glimpse of Cora, 
hinting none too subtley that 
their relationship will be the 
focus of the film . Nick adopts 
Frank as a friend , but Frank 
is obviously only interested 
in Cora, and oon engineers 
an opportunity to trap her 
alone in the hou e. The 
brutal and seamy sexual 
encounter which is the 
culmination of Frank ' plans 
is the start of his and Cora's 
sado-masochistic affair. 

Inexplicably, Frank and 
Cora fall in love, or what 
Rafelson would like us to 
believe is love, and decide 
they want more than their 
covert affair. Their solution 
is to attempt to kill Nick. 

The plot unfolds in a 
straightforward narrative 
and holds little in the way of 
surprises. 

Screenwriter Mamet is 
also a playwright, author of 

Sexual Peroersity i11 Chicago, 
and is admired by Rafelson 
for his direct writin~. 
Postman s hows Mamet s 
talent of cutting through to 
the core and discarding 
extraneous material which, 
in the case of Postman , 
disposes of the interest as 
well . With a setting and 
script that left little besides 
the characters, Rafelson , 
who prides himself on 
making films about people, 
had free reign to develop the 
character in accordance 
with his own conceptions. 
But Frank and Cora are more 
disgusting than interesting. 

Any redeeming features that 
the two might have had are 
sacrificed in favor of 
Rafelson 's vision, and the 
result i fatal for the film. 
The basic antipathy that the 
audience feels for the couple 
defeats the movie. 

Postman is being old on its 
sexual content, and there is a 
large expanse of flesh on 
screen, but nothing that 
could be called erotic. 
Rafelson. who had always 
been fascinated by the sexual 
undertone of Cain's novel , 
succeeds only in making one 
wish he hadn 't been so 
intrigued by it. Despite the 
s ustained sex scene and the 
blunt photography , the 
scenes are never more than 
tacky and are occasionally 
absurd. 

Most of Frank and Cora's 
interludes resemble hand-to-
hand com bat more than 
anything else, and the 
soundtrack i scored to 
match. 

The photography of Sven 
Nykvist is exceptionally 
realistic and frequently uses 
existing light. This , in 
conjunction with the 
predominantly earth tone 

Record Review/Jeff Beresford-Howe 

ets and locations, creates a 
depression atmosphere that 
is adly wasted. As it is, the 
ubtle photography is lost in 

the muddle of a senseless 
script and inept direction. 

Jack Nicholson and jessica 
Lange are both in top form for 
Postman, but this, regrettab-
ly only amplifies Rafelson's 
misguided direction. Nichol-
son is an archetypal drifter, 
seedy and worn. Lange is the 
living incarnation of Cora, 
looking the part so much that 
she would have been hard 
presssed to make a mistake. 
John Colicos, a Nick, is 
thoroughly obnoxious and 
utterly real , forming the 
third part of Postman 's 
twisted love triangle. Their 
performances and character· 
izations are all on the mark, 
but their talents are turned to 
making Postman as unap-
pealing as it is. 

The blame for The 
Postman Always Rings Twice 
must fall on director 
Rafel son. He was given a 
proven story, professional 
and popular actor and an 
expert cinematographer, but 
Rafelson misdirected the 
whole into a film of the story, 
one that fail the ba ic test of 
being entertaining. That 
Postman never really drags, 
and does have a few 
(intentionally) humorous 
moment and some nicely 
played scenes, is testament 
that all the creative power 
packed in to the cast and crew 
wasn't entirely wasted . The 
story works only if the 
audience cares about the 
characters. Frank, Cora and 
Nick aren't unintere ting, 
but Rafelson makes them so 
repugnant that the audience 
doesn't care what happens to 
them and any emotional 
impact the film might make 
is gone. Once thi inevitable 
antipathy strikes, and it 
doesn't take long, Postman is 
only an exercise in 
tastelessness and futility. 

The Postman Always Rings 
Twice is currently showing at 
the Valley Circle Theater. 

'Dead' albuln restores faith

- Bob Dylan, 1979 
BY JEFF

taft Writer 

Reckoning-The Grate-
ful Dead-Artista-
Double Album. 

You took MDA last 
weekend-lots of it. It was 
sunny so you al 0 spent the 
whole weekend at the beach, 
throwing footballs and 
swimming in the ocean. You 
are now baked. The few brain 
cells you have left are 
rebelling, screaming for 
sleep, streaming pain to your 
burned, sand-rubbed skin. 

But the MDA won't let you 
have anything more than a 
half-sleep that's no t 
ignificantly better than 

working all night. 
Ah! But you have a copy of 

the new Grateful Dead album 
to which you can look 
forward. 

Except this album looks 
grim. It' a double, live 
acoustic set, and it's hard to 

imagine the Dead filling even 
one album with interesting, 
non-electric music 

Besides, all your friends 
who like The Who and The 
Police say the Dead suck as 
instrumentalists, and if 
they're right, an acoustic 
album will not hide the 
mistakes that amplification 
usually does. What you have 
here is a problem of faith. 
Their last live album, Steal 
Your Face , was badly done, 
and studio albums since than 
have been uneven. 

That is why Reckoning is a 
religious experience, a 
renewal of your confidence in 
the Dead, and a reminder of 
why you started listening to 
them in the first place. 

T05tart with, this album i 
impeccably produced. Every 
instrument and note and 
vocal is a clear as if jerry and 
Bob and the boys stopped by 
your house to jam and 
borrowed guitar from your 
upstair neighbor. 

And all of il i ju t ba ically 
the Grateful Dead, electric or 
not. 

The last two son~s on side 
1, "Oh Babe It Ain t No Lie" 
and "It Mu t Have Been the 
Roses ," are the best jerry 
Garcia vocals you could ever 
hope to find . 

The first song on side 2, 
"Dark Hollow," is the be t 
country-Dead Bob Weir ha 
ever done, and should be 
heard first while an Amtrak 
train headed north passes by. 
The econd ong, "China 
Doll," from Mars Hotel, i a 
pacey as they come. 
When the Dead break into 

"Ripple" as the last song on 
the album after a Garcia· 
Hunter song, "Bird Song," 
you know that the Dead have 
It. 

There are no bad songs on 
this album. The record will 
make you know the Grateful 
Dead again , if you were ever 
so unfortunate as to lose 
touch with them in the first 
place.

'Buffalo,' 
poets are 
this week 

The UCSD Department of 
Drama pre ent · Da v id 
Mam et 's award ·winning 
play , American Buf falo , 
directed by Robert Berhnger. 
at the Mandeville Recital Hall 
on May 7. 8 and 9. Curtain is 
at 8 pm nightly with a 2 pm 
matinee on Saturday, May 9, 

American Buffalo, which 
won its author the 1977 
Drama Critics ' Circle Award 
for Best American Play and 
the 1976 Obie Award, was 
first produced by the 
Goodman Theatre Stage Two 
in Chicago in 1975 and 
received its Broadway debut 
two years later at the Ethel 
Barrymore Theatre, The 
play revolves around the lives 
of three small·time charac· 
ters in a Chicago junk shop 
who fancy themselves as 
business men pursuing the 
legitimate concern of free 
enterprise as they plot to rob 
a man of his coin collection, 
The play's central tension 
deals with the frustration 
between the characters' 
aspirations and their real 
world. The three desperately 
need each other yet pummel 
each other with words that 
are like punche , casually 
building to near violence. 

According to director 
Robert Berlinger, who 
recently directed Athol 
Fuard' Hello and Goodbye at 
UCSD, American BuffaLo is a 
play about interperso~al 
relationships and the notIOn 
that working hard to acheive 
your goals is more important 
than the nurturing of 
intimacy in your own life. 
American Buffalo has 
definite regional tone, and 
urban flavor, with its poetic 
sense fragmented and 
intensified, characteristic of 
contemporary 20th century 
playwriting, 

American Buffalo tickets 
are $2 and available at the 
UCSD Theatre Ticket Office, 
located behind the UCSD 
Book tore, open between 
noon and 4 pm weekdays. For

Recruiting: how coaches sell UCSD 
Emphasis is on locale, academic reputation 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
enior I1Iff Writer 

Recruiting. To many 
people this wor~ c<?njure~ up 
images of bIg tIme 
athletics '-athlete on full 
scholars hips who cruise 
around campll in their 
Porsche 911' and dumb 
jocks who receive credit for 
courses they've never 
attended, Negative connota-
tions like these make one 
wonder about the future of 
recru iting and intercollegiate 
sports. 

But recruiting need not 
lead to 'big time athletics ' and 
all the associated vices, as 
several UCSD coaches are 
proving. These coache dO.n't 
recruit with scholarshIps 
ince this is expressly 

forbidden by UCSD's athletic 
philosophy, and furthermore , 
they feel it i n't neces ary to 
recruit with money. 
Conversely UCSD 's coaches 
recruit by selling the school 
and selected a peets of the 
area, 

"I've had the best 
recruiting year you can 
imagine, and we're a non· 
scholarship school," said 
waterpolo coach Denny 
Harper. "I've got kids who 
have turned down scholar-
ships at Berkeley and Santa 
Barbara to play waterpolo at 
UCSD." 

"Every athlete that I'm 
recruiting is al 0 being 
recruited by big name 
Division 1 chool, " said 
basketball coach John Block, 

What does UCSD have to 
offer these high caliber 
athletes and how do coache 
like Harper and Block attract 
them? 

All coaches interviewed 
agreed on the priority of 
aspects they stress when 
recruiting athlete . Far and 
away the strongest selling 
poin t is UCS D ' s fine 
academic reputation . The 
quality of the education and 
the value of the UCSD degree 
seems to be a major factor in 
attracting athletes, 

Following the school' s 
academic reputation, a great 
deal of emphasis is placed on 
the s pecific athle t i c 
programs, In each case the 
approach is different 
depending upon the team's 
past history . 

Swim coach Bill Morgan, 
who has a well·established 
program, can impress 
potential swimmers with his 
team 's fine performances at 
the swimming nationals over 
the past four years . 

However, coaches of other 
programs which are still in 
the building stages are not 
able to rely as much on

Dannevik , who ha also 
achieved a relatively table 
program, ell his coaching 
philo ophy and theoppo~tun· 
itie for travel and nat IOnal 
competition. 

Harper emphasizes the 
advantages of playing in a 
developing program. "1 tell 
the athlete that he can go to a 
big school and sit on the 
bench for two year or come 
play at UCSD and help us put 
this program on the map." 
said Harper, 

In the same vein, Block 
makes no attempt to hide the 

fact that no recent basketball 
coach has lasted more than 
one season, ''I'm honest with 
the playt:r~. This program is 
In transItIOn, we re on our 
way up, and they can be part 
of seeing the program built," 
said Block. 

The final sellin~ point for 
mo t coaches positIve aspects 
of the UCSD campus and the 
surrounding comll!unity, All 
coaches agreed that the 
beautiful environment, 
beaches, and excellent 
climate all enhance the 
probability of attracting 
athletes. 

How do these coaches go 
about recruiting ath letes? 
Again the approach differs 

depending upon the coach 
and the team. 

Dannevik find these 
athlete by visiting high 

hool games , by running a 
volleyball summer camp. and 
al 0 from letters by player 
interes ted in UCSD . 
Potential volleyball players 
are ent a questionnaire that 
covers s uch item a 
proposed major, academic 
interest, high school GPA 
and SAT scores, etc, 

After the questionnaire is 
returned, Dannevik follows 
up with a phone call in order 
to arrange forthe parent and 
athlete to vi it UCSD. Here 
they spend two and a half 
hours looking at the campus 
facilities, includingdormitor· 
ie s and cafeterias, and 
discussing college life. 
Dannevik personally follows 
the admissions process for 
each athlete, and after the 
acceptance, ends informa· 
tion on housing and financial 
aid. 

Blockalodoesmuchofhis 
recruiting by visiting high 
schools and junior colleges 
where he has the opportunity 
to see the athlete in action 
and also speak with the 
coach , Several personal 
contacts in other parts of the 
state are also helpful in 
pointing the way towards 
good talent. 

Harper has put most of his 
energy into attracting 
athletes who have played 
waterpolo under his direction 
in the past. This time 
expense seems to have paid

Finally, Morgan relie on a

Morgan's strongest selling 
point i hi team' rapid . 
improvement and high 
success rate in national 
competition. 

From what geographic 
area do these coaches 
recruit? Harper has done 
much of his recruiting in the 
San Diego area while 
Dannevik looks for athletes 
in San Diego, Los Angeles, 
and Santa Barbara. Block 
recruits mainly outside of 
San Diego in both Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, 
Morgan contends that the 
San Diego area produces few 
high caliber swimmers and 
also recruits in Los Angeles 
and other areas. 

All four coaches see 
recruiting as a positive step 
in improving UCSD athlet· 
ics. They view their role as 
one of breaking the ice in this 
area and proving that 
recruiting can be beneficial to 
the sports program and the 
school in general. 

If team records are any 
indication, it appears that 
those coaches who recruit are 
more sucessful than their 
counterparts who do not 
recruit.

W otnen' s soccer goes 'big' 
Will join southern league intercollegiates 

BY J ENIFER WARREN 
laU Writer 

Inexperience is a word 
most coaches of teams with 
poor records like to use a lot, 
be ita ppropriat e or not. 

Such is the case with Trey 
Conrique, coach of UCSD's 
women' soccer team. But 
Conrique has every right to 
use the label inexperienced to 
explain his squad 's 0-3-2 
record, for this is the first 
year a women' soccer team 
at UCSD ha competed 
in tercollegiately. 

" W knew from the 
beginning that our skills 
would be far below those of 
UCLA, San Diego State and 
other teams that have been 
around for years," said 
Conrique. 

Con seq uentl y, "the 
hardest thing for us has been 
patience. We areprogressin~, 
that 's obvious. But we aren t 
winning or scoring much so 
it's easy to get frustrated." 

After several years of 
effort , the team finally gained 
funding from the intercolleg-
iate department this year, 
abandoning its club statu 
and joining the Southern 
Divis ion of the California 
College Women's Soccer 
Conference. SDSU, UCLA, 
UC Riverside, Cal State Long 

Beach, and the Claremont 
College compete again t the 
Tritons in that league. 

For the past everal year ', 
UCSD was a member of the 
San Dieguito occer League, 
competing against women' 
club team from all over the 
San Diego area. Last year, the 
Triton snagged third in that 
league, but played at a kill 
level far below that which is 

demanded of them in 
intercollegiate competition. 

UCSD came very clo e to 
its first win thi sea on 

aturdayagain t Claremont. 
Li a Yonemoto put C D up 
1-0 lale in th fir t half, but 
Claremont ended the game on 
a direct kick awarded on a 
pu hing call to make t he final 
~re I-I.

Anderson on politics 
Laurie Anderson, one of the world's most prominent 

performance artists , who has been described as a high·tech 
Lily Tomlin, wi11 present one of here evenings of art magic, 
Thursday, April 23, 8 pm, in Mandevi11e Auditorium, under 
the auspices of the UCSD Department of Music. 

Although combining several media may no longer be 
unique, what distinguishes Anderson from anylxxiy else is 
here superior grasp of technology, impressive mUSIcal and 
verbal skills, coupled to a fine sense of humor, plus a fetile 
imagination which uses her remarkable associateve ability 
to produce social criticism that is art, not diatribe. 

Anderson's latest production, called "United States," is a 
four part series involving electronic tape, live sound, film 
and voice. Each part looks at one aspect of American 
culture: transportation, politics, money and love. 

The San Diego r.;rformance focuses on politics with such 
enticing titles as 'From the Air"; "0 Supennan", for organ 
tape and voice; "Electronic Dogs," for tape and viol\n; 
"Neon Duet for Violin and Images"; "Let X Equal X" for 
vocoder and tape; "Language is a Virus (from Outer 
Space)" for Wilham Burroughs, among others.
