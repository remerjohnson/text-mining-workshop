Amidst a year of budget cuts and closures, 
the UCSD libraries and students will benefit 
from a new endowment of $1.1 million 
from the Alice G. Marquis Living Trust, the 
university announced Oct. 11. The grant will 
help offset the last year’s $3 million cut to 
the university’s library 2011-12 budget as the 
university faces a $60 million school-wide 
cut in funding from the state. The cuts are a 
result of Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget proposed 
in Jan. 11, which cut $500 million from the 
entire UC system.

In response to the planned closures of 
four major university library resources — 
three have already closed —   part of the 
grant will be allocated to the creation of a 
new 24-hour study area in Geisel Library – 
open five days a week – scheduled to begin 
operation in fall 2012.

“This helps students because now they 
have access to a 24-hour study space,” 
Academic Senate Library Committee 
undergraduate representative Anish Bhayani 
said. “This is something that students have 
been begging for since the beginning. It is 
definitely a big win for students in terms of 
having more access to study space during the 
school year.”

Previously, Geisel Library has only hosted 
24-hour study areas during Week 10 and 
finals week. This will still be the case for 
2011-12 — the new “24/5” study areas will 
not be open until next fall.

as faculty by providing funds to support

The Student Conduct Code Revision Workgroup will hold 
final consultation sessions in the coming weeks and is expected 
to have a draft of the code finalized by winter quarter.

“The goal is to have the Code ready for full implementation in 
Fall 2012,” Director of Career Services Center Andy Ceperley and 
Director of Student Conduct Benjamin White said.

All registered UCSD students, academics and staff received 
an email from the Office of the Vice Chancellor earlier this week, 
informing them of the current public input period.

The much-anticipated Cataracs concert has been rescheduled from Oct. 20 to Nov. 16 due to personal scheduling 
issues with the hip-hop indie duo. Despite 
being scheduled to perform at UCSD this 
week, posts on their twitter page show that the 
Cataracs are currently in Brazil recording their 
album and will be there for the remainder of 
October. 

“HOLY MOTHER OF MARY,” The 
Cataracs tweeted on Oct. 11. “WE MADE IT! 
WE SHALL BE LIVING IN A CASTLE IN 
BUZIOS, BRASIL & MAKING OUR ALBUM 

FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH.. vida!”
University Centers publicly announced the 

date change on Oct. 18 without a reason for the 
change of date.

“Obviously the change of date was due to an 
issue with the artist’s schedule but we worked 
hard to keep this show happening and to make 
sure that UCSD gets to see The Cataracs,” 
University Centers Special Events Coordinator 
Eliot Dreiband said in an email. 

Tickets purchased for the Oct. 20 concert 
are valid for the new concert date. Refunds will 
be available to students until Nov. 9 through the 
UCSD box office, according to the Associated 
Students Concerts & Events facebook page. 

“True, the rescheduled date is a bump in 

the road, but what’s in store for UCSD on Nov. 
16 with the Cataracs is now bigger and better,” 
the University Centers Marketing & Programs 
Office said in a statement to the Guardian. 

The concert will take place at the Price 
Center West Ballroom at 9 p.m.

“We are so juiced that we got to make up 
our date at UCSD in November,” The Cataracs 
said in a statement. “We’ve been recording a 
bunch of new music that we’ll be debuting for 
you guys.”

Additional tickets are available through the 
UCSD box office for $20.

Glowing Jellyfish Proteins Used in Gene 
TaggingÊtoÊFindÊDegenerativeÊDiseasesÊ
Nobel Prize Winner and UCSD professor of biochemisty Dr. Roger 
Tsien used glowing proteins from 
jellyfish to track genes and look for 
degenerative diseases in brains.

The process of gene tagging 
— a commonly used technique 
for tracking genes in cell biology, 
molecular biology and biochemistry 
— is a technique created by Tsien, 
who won a Nobel Prize in 2008 for 
his discovery in green fluorescent 
protein (GFP). He created 
genetically engineered bacteria 
capable of producing differently-
colored fluorescent proteins. 

Scientists use these glowing 
proteins to effectively track the 
location and time when certain 
genes are expressed in cells, and 
to isolate specific proteins within 
organisms. To make a gene glow, 
gene coding for the GFP is fused 
with the gene for a fluorescent 
protein. This causes the GFP to 
glow, allowing scientists to track its 
location within a cell or an entire 
organism. 

GFPs have many useful 
applications. Researchers can 
use these fluorescent proteins to 
highlight neural circuits within the 
brain, which could help researchers 
discover defecting circuitry that 
causes degenerative diseases like 
Parkinson’s and Alzhemier’s disease. 

In 1995, Tsien determined how 
GFP became fluorescent, then his 
discovery to create mutant forms 
of GFP and differently-colored 
proteins. This single point mutation 
increased the effectiveness of GFP 
and broadened its spectrum of 
colors as well. Tsien spoke of the 
significance of having a range of 
proteins that each emits unique 
colors.

“Basically you can monitor 
many signals at once inside the cell, 
and you can monitor interactions 
of proteins by the phenomenon 
of fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer,” Tsien said in a Dec. 6, 2008 
interview with Nobelprize.org. 

Tsien initially had difficulty 
making the original wild-type GFP 
— the standard form of a species 

as it appears in nature — useful, 
because it was easily influenced by 
its environment. It was harvested 
from jellyfish. 

“One remarkable property of the 
original jellyfish protein is that it 
actually isn’t just green. It excites, well 
it emits green, but it excites mostly 
in the UV, and only a small amount 
in the blue,” Tsien said. “And that’s 
a strange paradoxical phenomenon 
because we discovered that almost 
any mutation of one amino acid 
right next to the chromophore will 
shift it to being all of one or all of 
the other - either all UV or all blue.”

Scientists do not yet understand 
why the jellyfish proteins glow.

“One of the great mysteries that 
I’ve never figured out is why the 
jellyfish chose the only amino acid 
that would compromise, and be 
schizophrenic, and be partly UV 
and partly blue in its absorbance,” 
Tsien said. “And it could have so 
easily shifted it to all of one or all of 
the other. Instead it’s preserved this 
split character. We don’t know why.”

Scientists can manipulate amino 

acids to control what color they 
want a protein to emit.

“At least for the wild-type, there’s 
one amino acid that controls really 
primary color of the emission, and 
the next one to it controls, if you 
are going to be green, what is your 
absorbance spectrum,” Tsien said.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

our collections, especially in 
History,” University Librarian Brian 
E. C. Schottlaender said in an email. 
“Students will be very positively 
impacted next fall, when our new 24/5 
study area will open in Geisel.”

Last February, the university 
administration announced 
the closure of four university 
libraries, including the Center 
for Library & Instructional 
Computing Services and the 
International Relations & Pacific 
Studies Library. 

Schottlaender said that though the 
gift is much appreciated, it wouldn’t 
be enough to reopen the libraries that 
closed last year.

“In spite of this bequest, 
the university and the libraries 
continue to face severe budget 

cuts as the State’s situation shows no 
signs of improving,” Schottlaender 
said.

According to a university 
press release, approximately 
800 study seats were lost in the 
closures. 

As part of A.S. Council’s May 2011 
“Save Our Libraries Campaign,” 126 
new computer workstations will be 
added in Geisel during Fall Quarter 
and over 260 new study seats will be 
added next year. The Geisel expansion 
is expected to be completed during 
summer of 2012.

In addition to the study lounges, 
a portion of the gift will be used to 
enhance and maintain the library’s 
collection, and will also fund the 
H. Stuart Hughes UCSD Libraries 
Endowment for Modern European 
History.

The Alice G. Marquis Living Trust 
is named after a UCSD alumna who 
graduated with a doctorate in modern 
European history in 1979. The trust’s 
donation is the biggest single donation 
ever made to the university’s libraries. 
Marquis was a Holocaust survivor who 
immigrated to New York City after 
fleeing Nazi Germany in 1938. She 
passed away in 2009.

The collections of the closed 
libraries are being merged into the 
university’s two remaining libraries, 
the Biomedical Library and Geisel. It 
could take up to three years to complete 
the consolidation of the libraries. The 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography 
Library is scheduled to close in 2012, 
though the exact date has not been set.

Yesterday, A.S. Council had yet 
another adorable moment as Muir 
College Council addressed the council 
with a gift of a pot painted with “MCC 
[heart] AS.” Everyone was touched 
by this moving moment. (Guardian 
snaps.)

A.S. Council 
was also very 
pleased to have 
special guest Vice 
Chancellor of 
Student Affairs 
Penny Rue speak 
to them.

“You have set 
yourself apart from other students 
by your willingness to serve fellow 
students and sitting in on sometimes 
achingly long meetings,” Rue said. “I 
want you to think about your hopes 
and aspirations for this year. When 
you get to the end of next spring, what 
do you want to be known for?”

Yes, what do you want to be 
remembered for, council? No pressure. 
It’s only your legacy.

“Working with you is one of 
the highlights of my job,” Rue said. 
“I’m delighted to look for individual 
opportunities to help you achieve your 
goals.”

Council addressed Rue with 
the conflict Hullabaloo had with 
Marshallpalooza. This conflict caused 
Marshallpalooza to move from Friday 
of week eight to Thursday.

“People like their traditions, 
but students enjoy things like the 
Unolympics and Spirit Night that 
remind you that you’re a part of 
something bigger than yourself,” Rue 
said. “You’re going to come back in 10 
years and think, ‘Holy Moses, I had a 
part in making [Hullabaloo] happen.’”

The Afghan Student Organization 
addressed the council with its request 
for $33,029 for their American 

Medical Overseas Relief fundraising 
event. It will be a comedy show on 
Friday, Dec. 3 starting at 6 p.m.

“[AMOR thinks it is] important 
to make sure that it is not just 
Americans running a hospital, but 
that they are teaching Afghans how to 

do it themselves,” 
C o - P r e s i d e n t 
of the Afghan 
S t u d e n t 
O r g a n i z a t i o n 
Nilofer Hamed 
said.

A.S. Council 
passed the budget 

at $14,794, since the council can only 
pass half of external contracts. 

This was followed by a special 
presentation from the Student 
Conduct Code committee. The new 
conduct code has officially entered 
public input. 

Eventually we finally made it to my 
favorite segment.

“I have been receiving input that 
Council Member of the Week needs a 
little more excitement,” Vice President 
of Student Life Meredith Madnick 
said, to my utmost excitement. “So 
I have added a runway component, 
where the new Council Member of 
the Week will need to strut their stuff 
while I explain why they are being 
awarded.”

Let me say I was delighted to 
watch Vice President of Finances 
and Resources Kevin Hoang do the 
catwalk, strutting and turning while 
wearing the infamous bright blue, 
glittery sash we all adore. Work it, 
Hoang, work it.

Council finally announced the 
appointment of Freshman Senators 
Shahrzad Gustafson, Vincent 
Honrubia and Andrew Clark as well 
as Transfer Senators Steven Kim and 
Diana Lee. Congrats, kiddos.

site. Please provide your feedback on 
the draft Code either via the web site 
or directly to the work group’s chair as 
identified on the site,” Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Penny Rue said in the 
university-wide email. Any affiliate of 
the university is encouraged to submit 
comments regarding the revisions 
visible in the draft last updated on 
April 29, 2011.

Consultations are being held 
throughout this quarter with various 
university committees and other 
entities such as the six college councils 
and the Graduate Student Association. 
A general forum open to all student 
organizations is being held Oct. 20.

“Much of the feedback we’ve 
already received has supported the 
simplification of how the code is 
written and the overall student conduct 
process.” Ceperley and White said.

In comparison to the existing 
code — last revised on Aug. 29, 

2008 — the new draft contains less 
legal language and unnecessary text. 
Despite lengthening the introduction 
and adding a new “definitions” section, 
the writers shortened the document. 

Most sections are seeing minor 
formatting and phrasing adjustments, 
but the guidelines for the appeals 
process is undergoing major changes.

In the established code, the Council 
of Provosts is designated as a secondary 
judicial body open only for appeals 
involving multiple students from more 
than one jurisdiction. The council 
would be more prevalent as the sole 
board of appeals for undergraduate 
students. Currently, if a sanction is 
imposed upon a student or student 
organization, an appeal can be made 
within seven academic days after the 
notice is given. Under the new conduct 
code, the appeal must be made within 
10 business days.

“A major goal of the workgroup 
has been to review best practices 

from campuses across the country. 
The workgroup has reviewed and 
adopted Code provisions from the UC 
System wide Student Conduct Code, 
two Model Student Conduct Codes 
and Codes from the University of 
Maryland, the University of Florida, 
Rutgers University, and other public 
and private institutions.” Ceperley and 
White said.

The workgroup, chaired by 
Ceperley, consists of 24 members. 
Constituents of the committee include 
a number of UCSD affiliates such 
as A.S. Council members, Graduate 
Student Association members and 
college deans.

In May 2009, Rue charged these 
representatives with the task of 
reviewing and improving the Student 
Conduct Code in hopes of enhancing 
the campus atmosphere.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

The marathon known as the San Diego Comic-Con only comes around once a year, 
spilling a bonanza of free swag onto 
the laps of every lucky attendee. It 

can range from the truly absurd (an 
Edgar Allen Poe 3-D glasses mask 
from Francis Ford Coppola), to the 
unbelievably fantastic (I got a mock-
ingjay pin, bitches). 

The skill set needed to snatch this 
swag out from under the noses of 
more than 125,000 competing attend-
ees includes having the tenacity of a 
linebacker, an eagle eye and a pair of 
very sharp elbows as weapons. This is 
perhaps the only way you can survive 
by ducking and weaving past waves 
of gawking masses, all inexplicably 
bent on taking a picture with a child 
dressed as Thor.

One thing to keep in mind before 
heading into the fray: You can’t win 
them all. Nothing threw me off my 
game like seething in resentment over 
missing out on a Gears of War dog 
tag giveaway. First world problems. 
After a quick dose of perspective and 
the realization that the guy in front 
of me was jealously eyeing my fat roll 
of posters (still not a euphemism), I 
felt ready to tackle the line forming 
outside the FOX pavilion. 

I also had to remember that I 
wasn’t the only fan. At Comic-Con, 
it doesn’t matter how obscure your 
interests are — this isn’t an indie 
rock convention. I thought I liked 
the Guild — well, so did a thousand 
other people, all of whom seemed 
determined to date Felicia Day’s ava-
tar. So no matter who you want to 
see, or what free giveaway you want 
to hit up, keep in mind that you will 
probably have to shove your way past 
hordes of other crazy people.

And this brings up the age-old 
question: line up or just fight to the 
death? I guess the general rule was 
that if a line was already formed, 
people should follow it. Well, except 
for a particularly rabid FOX poster 
giveaway — to spite the line-cutters, 
I just took the entire stack of limited 
edition Bones posters and left. 

If you find yourself in the middle 
of a sweaty mob, gyrating to the beat 
of a free t-shirt giveaway, try and 
flank the mob by pushing to the right 
or left of the booth. If all else fails — 
try sympathy. I’m not going to say 
that using puppy dog eyes will get 
you a free Marvel t-shirt, but my pile 
of Wolverine crap can speak for itself. 

By the last day of the convention, 
vendors will invariably run out of free 
swag to give away. Fans even tapped 
out Lionsgate’s seemingly bottom-
less pit of Hunger Games posters. I 
was saddened. I only got ten posters. 
So the moral of the story is: hit the 
booths hard for free stuff in the first 
few days — some employees are more 
lax about giving things away in the 
first couple of days anyways.

And above all, try and have fun. 
Comic-Con may have been a demen-
tor-like essence that nearly sucked my 
life force away, but I’ll be damned if it 
wasn’t the best four days of my life.

In an effort to address the issues of higher education, college students plan on bringing the protest closer 
to home with the Occupy Colleges 
movement, slated to start on 
Thursday, Oct. 20. This is a chance 
for college students to make an 
impact on a social movement 
that is quickly growing in 
importance. Media outlets 
are not the only ones 
picking up the hype — 
social media is flood-
ing with pictures, 
videos and blogs that 
illustrate the urgen-
cy of the move-
ment.  Occupy 
Colleges is 
acknowledging a 
top-down issue: 
the small minority 
at the top of the 
hierarchy makes 
pivotal decisions 
affecting students. 
But in spite of all 
the justified anger, 
students may not 
have the pull — or 
strength in numbers 
— to fix this persistent 
hierarchical problem. 

The Occupy Wall Street 
campaign that began on 
Sept. 17 is looking to stoke the 
flames of social and economic 
discontent by pointing a finger at 
the fat cats on Wall Street and anyone 
else in the top 1 percent of income-
earners.  What began as a small protest against 
corporate greed in downtown Manhattan has grown 
to become a loosely cobbled nationwide movement. 

With a more modest set of grievances than its New York cousin, the 
college-based protests aim to express concern over the students’ inability 
to find employment upon graduation, while concurrently facing undue 
amounts of educational debt. California’s education system has seen $15 
billion in cuts the past four years and employers are only adding 11,000 net 
jobs this year.

But while Occupy Colleges has a relatable mission, it lacks the narrow 
demands that other successful protests have had in the past. For example, 
the Freedom Riders from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s traveled 
to Mississippi to register black voters and thus integrate them politically 

to increase equality. Students 
today must channel their indig-

nation towards one particular 
adversary — without focus, the 

movement is merely a waste of 
poster board. 

If students could establish clear 
grievances and take responsibility in 

eliminating them, then the vast 
education groups could make 

substantial strides. 
Students are not the 

only ones to protest in 
the name of educa-
tion — teachers have 
already come out in 
vast numbers in the 
Occupy L.A. effort. 
They are fighting 
the major cuts in 
education and the 
enormous salary 
gap between the 
top district execu-
tives and the sub-
ordinates. While 
the Associated 
Administrators of 
Los Angeles agreed 

to a 12 percent pay 
cut to save jobs, the 

Los Angeles Unified 
School District hired 

nine new administrators 
for six-figure salaries. 

Corporations often fund 
salaries for executives to influ-

ence their decisions for personal 
benefit instead of the best interests of 

the students and educators.
The United Teachers of Los Angeles 

provides an example of an organized union with 
a purpose, definitive leadership and stated grievances, 

including the fact that over 1,000 staffers were laid off despite a 
$55 million in surplus and classroom sizes pushing 40 students per teacher.

According to the Occupy Colleges website, the movement has students 
from 150 colleges participating across the country. Two UCLA graduates, a 
California State University Northridge student and a California community 
college student started the movement. It’s no wonder that California stu-
dents are leading the movement — with California having the second-high-
est unemployment rate in the country and with 150,000 students turned 
away from California community colleges last year, it’s time students’ voices 

Last Wednesday, with a com-bination of prior planning and might makes right, A.S. 
Council passed its 2011-12 execu-
tive budget in just over an hour.

The one-hour figure may not 
seem like much, but it’s heartstop-
pingly impressive given that our 
motley group of campus bureau-
crats was once known for 12-hour 
meetings spent debating exciting 
topics, such as whether to fund the 
Loft or not. And when it came to 
the budget meeting, which deter-
mines the annual funding alloca-
tions and is the guiding document 
of our student government, sena-
tors, executives and Guardian A.S. 
columnists alike knew that making 
it to a Thursday 8 a.m. class was 
unlikely.

This year’s success can be traced 
back to two factors, one of them 
that is out of the control of future 
aspiring politicians and the other a 
new idea that should be continued. 

First, our current council 
benefits enormously from being 
chock-full of members that ran on 
the same political slate and thus 

have the same priorities and voting 
patterns. This time last year, then-
A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
was fighting a losing battle in the 
midst of divided government. Ben 
Hassine of the Students First! slate 
was alone in the executive council 
and struggled to push through her 
diversity- and tuition-oriented ini-
tiatives; the rest of the council were 
awash with the yellow of Tritons 
First and were less than impressed 
with either her ideas or the execu-
tion of them.

When it came to the execu-
tive budget, Ben Hassine created 
a draft — presumably the one she 
thought would be discussed — 
that implemented an 8-percent 
across-the-board cut. Dissatisfied 
council members — including 
then-Vice President of Student Life 
Kristina Pham, the second in com-
mand, who disagreed with her allo-
cations and created an alternative 
budget that preserved the funding 
for student orgs and events such as 
Bear Garden, while removing the 
senators’ $10 weekly stipend. They 
sprung this budget on Ben Hassine 

on the day of the budget meet-
ing.  Frustration ensued. This time 
around, there was no such repeat; 
with over 90 percent of council 
elected from President Alyssa 
Wing’s Board the Wing slate, these 
preexisting connections were noth-
ing but an asset to cooperation.

But while the biggest aid to a 
painless budget is working with 
people who agree with you, A.S. 
Council should still be commended 
for its planning initiatives, espe-
cially its open communication and 
work done before the day of the 
meeting. Kudos to Vice President of 
Finance Kevin Hoang for creating a 
Budget Appropriations Committee 
dedicated to reviewing past spend-
ing trends. His efforts toward com-
piling descriptions of line items and 
making presentations regarding the 
budget ensured that other council 
members were prepared coming 
in to discuss the allocations them-
selves, instead of bogging down the 
process with questions that could 
have been answered weeks before. 
Future councils should take note 
of the process 

that made passing the budget as rel-
atively painless as it was on Oct. 12 
— while there’s no way to guarantee 
another single-slate council, the 
Budget Appropriations Committee 
should continue working before 
meetings so less fighting will occur 
on the council floor.

n an effort to address the 
issues of higher education, 
college students plan on 
bringing the protest closer 

to home with the Occupy Colleges 
movement, slated to start on 
Thursday, Oct. 20. This is a chance 
for college students to make an 
impact on a social movement 
that is quickly growing in 
importance. Media outlets 
are not the only ones 
picking up the hype — 
social media is flood-

videos and blogs that 
illustrate the urgen-

the small minority 

affecting students. 

the justified anger, 

have the pull — or 
strength in numbers 
— to fix this persistent 
hierarchical problem. 

The Occupy Wall Street 
campaign that began on 
Sept. 17 is looking to stoke the 
flames of social and economic 
discontent by pointing a finger at 
the fat cats on Wall Street and anyone 
else in the top 1 percent of income-
earners.  What began as a small protest against 

to increase equality. Students 
today must channel their indig-

nation towards one particular 
adversary — without focus, the 

movement is merely a waste of 
poster board. 

If students could establish clear 
grievances and take responsibility in 

eliminating them, then the vast 
education groups could make 

substantial strides. 
Students are not the 

only ones to protest in 
the name of educa-
tion
already come out in 
vast numbers in the 
Occupy L.A. effort. 
They are fighting 
the major cuts in 
education and the 
enormous salary 
gap between the 
top district execu-
tives and the sub-
ordinates. While 
the 
Administrators of 
Los Angeles agreed 

to a 12 percent pay 
cut to save jobs, the 

Los Angeles Unified 
School District hired 

nine new administrators 
for six-figure salaries. 

Corporations often fund 
salaries for executives to influ-

ence their decisions for personal 
benefit instead of the best interests of 

the students and educators.
The United Teachers of Los Angeles 

provides an example of an organized union with 

STUDENTS, ASSEMBLE
The Occupy College movement is a prime opportunity for students to take part in history, but whether 

the protests will make a difference is still uncertain.

THE MENTAL FISHBOWL By Alex Nguyen 

Movement Must Channel Focus to Create Change
are heard.

With such a vast movement, it is impossible for one 
person to push the pedals. Occupy Colleges is leaderless, 
and students hope to keep it that way in the spirit of a 
collective voice. But this proved detrimental last week at 
the University of Minnesota when miscommunication 
and lack of organization brought its activism to a halt, 
as the university’s planned protest was greeted by only a 
handful of students. But U of Minnesota students agree 
that attendance would drastically increase with more 
advertising and hype. The students care about the pro-
test, it is just a matter of expelling the information. 

Occupy Colleges faces the challenge of having 150 
individual protests across the country and no clear solu-
tion on how to centralize action. But a movement like 
this is more possible than ever with the aid of social 
media. The Wall Street protests drew media attention 

through YouTube videos that featured police attacking 
protesters. According to the Occupy Colleges Twitter 

page, the protests are scheduled to take place every two 
weeks so that students can balance their classes while 
keeping the sentiment present until there is a significant 
result. This sounds like an effective plan but the likeli-
ness that people will continue to show up even after the 
trendiness of the movement fades is unlikely. If past per-
formance is any indicator of present, this will be a rally 
that one attends for three hours on Thursday and then 
kicks back to see if they made it on the news. 

Occupy Colleges has strength in press, but now it 
is a matter of commitment and endurance. This is an 
opportunity for anyone who has ever been slighted out 
of taking an overcrowded required course, stressed over 
crushing student loans, or has boldly cried out, “I’m part 
of the 99 percent!” Change is possible — we have the 
technology. Now we just need you.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Dr. Irwin Jacobs is on the com-

mittee to select the new UCSD 
Chancellor.  He should not be on the 
committee, as he has contributed $2 
million to the refurbishment of the 
University House, the Chancellor’s 
official residence: $1 million before, 
and $1 million after he received 
the Chancellor’s Medal from the cur-
rent Chancellor.  

Indeed, the entire residence at 
9630 La Jolla Farms Road should 
be given back to the Indians (it was 
constructed on a burial site).  It is to 
have 20 dedicated parking spaces.  It 
is to have a 100 ft. long, 13 ft. high 
(above grade) retaining wall.  Eleven 
to 13 piers are to be drilled to a depth 
of 30 ft. and would function to pro-
vide gross and surface stabilization to 
the wall.

 Dr. Irwin Jacobs and his team at 
Linkabit (precursor of Qualcomm) 
developed a coding scheme used by 
NASA for deep space probes still in 
use today and developed variable-
aperture satellites. Since “Dr. Jacobs 
is one of San Diego’s leading states-
man and his company Qualcomm 
changed the way modern man 
communicates,” The San Diego Air 
and Space Museum will induct Dr. 
Jacobs, along with an astronaut and 
several other famous military pilots, 
into their Hall of Fame on Nov. 5, 
2011.

I attended the memorial ser-
vice at the Balboa Naval Hospital 
across from said museum three days 
before Easter of this year for Seaman 
Benjamin D. Rast, who was killed by 
a “friendly” Hellcat missile fired from 
a Predator drone in Afghanistan 
earlier this month. The Pentagon 
says marines in Afghanistan and the 
crew controlling the drone in Nevada 

were unaware analysts watching the 
firefight via live video in Indiana who 
had doubts about the targets’ identity. 

“Unmanned aircraft is taking 
on increasingly difficult missions. 
However, in the fog of war, there 
are still situations where you need 
a pilot’s instinct inside the cockpit,” 
an analyst said.  “If the military has 
a plane that can do both missions, 
it may save money on maintenance 
personnel and spare parts. It’s the 
same engine. It’s the same airframe. 
The only difference is how it’s 
piloted.” 

 Dr. Jacobs emphatically was not 
the drone pilot.

Yet the costs of failed scien-
tific experiments at UCSD and else-
where in the University of California 
system were socialized by grants and 
fees paid to public higher educa-
tion by the federal and state govern-
ments, and by students and their par-
ents — while the profits were priva-
tized by Irwin M. Jacobs, by former 
UCSD Chancellor and University 
President Emeritus Richard C. 
Atkinson, by Andrew Viterbi (also of 
Qualcomm) and by many others. You 
may want to start reviewing a fed-
eral judge’s ruling early last month 
citing California law that Juno, 
plaintiff, had to put up a $800,000 
bond before proceeding to trial in a 
patents-infringement lawsuit against 
Qualcomm.

Every Little BIT Counts...it starts with you. 

Keep Your 
Usher to 
Yourself
There’s a reason I guard my iTunes like the Sorcerer’s Stone: I listen to a lot of embarrassing shit. As 
much as I’d like to be seen as some kind 
of musical connoisseur, there are names 

in my library that can’t be denied. I have 
Ke$ha. Some Drake. Jamiroquai. The 
entire Britney Spears discography. Several 
albums of “wizard rock.” Worst of all, 
more Bruce Springsteen than anyone 
who isn’t my mother or from New Jersey 
should ever have. 

Clearly, there’s no hiding my love 
for pop music (and Harry Potter). But 
I’m not ashamed. I hate the idea of the 
“guilty pleasure” — if you like something, 
you like something, and I see no point 
in lying to people about it to seem cool. 
I’ll admit, there are some things that I’d 
rather keep on the down-low (namely, 
my obsession with “Moves Like Jagger”).

Too bad Spotify and Facebook are out 
to get me. 

When Spotify came to the U.S. this 
summer I was undeniably stoked. The 
streaming music service has a library of 
over 15 million tracks, ranging from the 
obscure to the Top 40; you just have to sit 
through a few ads an hour to access it all. 

The only downside: Your friends can 
see exactly what you’re listening to. 

As soon as you set up your Spotify 
account, the service reminds you to con-
nect with your Facebook. A sidebar is 
then activated, which includes a list of 
all your Facebook friends who are using 
Spotify. Their profiles feature the top art-
ists and songs they’ve been listening to, as 
well as playlists they’ve made on iTunes 
or Spotify itself. 

You can make any of this as private 
as you want; the problem is, most don’t 
realize how public their playlists are until 
too late. Not everyone was meant to see 

D espite their ominous moniker, Philadelphia’s the War on Drugs are less concerned with the contempo-rary dangers of narcotics than they 
are with digging out backroom obscurities 
at the local record shop. The group’s sopho-
more release, Slave Ambient, filters classic 
Americana through a lo-fi, psych rock lens, 
crafting a unique brand of retro rock. 

Rugged frontman Adam Granduciel spoke 
with the Guardian this week to discuss the 
band’s recent tour and return to California, 
which will land them in San Diego on Oct. 21. 

“Good Mexican food… great guitar 
shops…the reefer…awesome crowds,” 
Granduciel recalled as personal highlights of 
past SoCal tour dates — a brief, yet fitting list 
for the young working-class warrior. 

The War on Drugs hasn’t slacked off since 
the departure of co-founding member and ris-
ing solo artist Kurt Vile in 2008. Slave Ambient 

is a bold step forward in terms of songwriting 
and overall cohesiveness from War on Drugs’ 
full-length debut Wagonwheel Blues.  

“The first one was more of a collection of 
songs that I had that got put onto a record,” 
Granduciel said. “This one I began and ended 
as a record.” 

Plus, despite several line-up overhauls 
since the band’s formation in 2005, Granduciel 
feels confident that the current War on Drugs 
collective will remain recording and touring 
indefinitely.

While listeners and critics might be quick 
to parallel Slave Ambient’s rambling swagger 
with that of classic rock singers/songwrit-
ers like Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, 
Granduciel is first to object. He insists that 
motivation comes more from the lesser-
known forefathers of alternative music, such 
as Krautrockers Neu! and countless electronic 
composers of the late ’70s. These nuances cer-
tainly do reveal themselves on Slave Ambient, 
be it in the motorik drum rhythms (of Neu!) 
or the atmospheric electronics that engulf the 
tracks and transition between them.  

According to Granduciel, the most interest-
ing experience on tour so far  (which included 
shooting the shit with the likes of Dan Bejar, 
Craig Finn, and A.C. Newman) was when leg-
endary Detroit producer Christopher Koltay 
(Iggy Pop and MC5) unexpectedly dropped in 
on one of their shows.

War on Drugs’ Adam 
Granduciel Talks ’80s Legend

“He was at one of our shows playing shuffle board, and I couldn’t 
believe he actually showed up,” Granduciel said.  “I mean, he recorded 
some of the greats. We went back to his house — he has the MC5 royalties 
so he’s doing pretty well for himself — and he took us out to his recording 
studio that’s 100 yards out on Lake Eerie.  It’s a floating studio on the lake. 
The guy had all our records!”

It’s easy to imagine Granduciel living off the grid, too; the War on 
Drugs’ taste for obscurities is hardly traditional. But, like a random 
structure in the midst of a Great Lake, the band’s music is one impressive 
puzzle.

your Makeout mix — especially not your 
Facebook “friends” (who, in all likeli-
hood, include family and coworkers). 

But that ain’t the worst of it: Unless 
you’re wise enough to deactivate the fea-
ture yourself, Facebook will post every 
song you listen to on your Facebook wall. 
And that new mini-feed on the side of 
your page? It will be buzzing with all the 
Usher you decided to use as a distraction 
from your literature reading. 

See, I didn’t know this at first. One 
day, I opened Spotify to make a playl-
ist for my friend. I had been telling her 
about my obsession with ’60s girl groups 
and decided to send her my favorites. But, 
before I started pouring over Spotify’s 
endless stream of Phil Spector-produced 
jams, the service asked me if I wanted to 
connect to my Facebook. I assumed that 
this meant, Last.fm style, that Spotify 
might track my listening habits and 
send me recommendations — not that it 
would notify everyone I know what I’m 
listening to when I’m listening to it, in a 
sort of hipster James Joyce-type stream of 
consciousness. 

Now, my friends can wonder why I 
was listening to so much Diana Ross on a 
random Saturday afternoon.

I guess for some this might be a 
desirable feature. It’s a great way of hear-
ing about new music and stalking your 
friends. But I think there’s something 
worrisome about how much our music 
collections are becoming public. 

While I love sharing new tunes with 
my friends, the act of pouring over a new 
record alone in my room (without any 
judgment) — and then recommending it 
personally to the friends who’d appreciate 
it most — sounds way more appealing 
than watching songs fly by on a feed.

So call me a musical Luddite, what-
ever. I won’t be letting anyone see my 
dad-rock playlist anytime soon. 

ALBUM REVIEWS

T om Waits is getting old. And though he’s always channeled the raspy belt 
of a world-weary sea captain, the 
61-year-old folk legend’s recent 
hiatus and further descent into 
obscurity have tested his ability to 
remain cool. 

Luckily for Waits — and fans 
of his conceptual Vaudevillian 
freak-blues — he’s never known the 

meaning of the word. 
Bad as Me, Waits’ 17th studio 

LP, opens with the cacophony 
of banjo, brass and the ragtime 
key-pounding of “Chicago” — an 
instant “Great Train Robbery”-style 
classic and defiant reminder that 
Waits is louder and irresistibly 
weirder than ever. Echoing the port 
of call sea-chanty of Rain Dogs 
opener “Singapore,” Waits delivers 
the same booming vocal energy, 
this time dropping anchor amid 
sleeker production and a surprising 
focus on cohesive songwriting.  

In true “why-the-hell-not” 
fashion, the aging Waits enlisted 
a team of A-list rockers for Bad as 
Me, each sounding less like a col-
laborator and more like an actor 
leafing through Waits’ meticulously 
paced musical: Flea’s crawling 

bassline faintly pulsates beneath 
“Raised Right Men”’s sleazy, bayou 
stomp and gypsy jazz guitar, while 
Keith Richards’ acoustic noodling 
creates a pleasant fireside atmo-
sphere for Waits’ tortured poetry 
on introspective southern ballad 
“Last Leaf.” 

But Bad as Me shines even 
brighter when Waits strips down 
the brass stabs and kitchen cabinet 
percussion, placing his brilliant 
songwriting and Closing Time-
era croon in the smoky barroom 
spotlight. Showstopper “Back In 
The Crowd” finds a forlorn Waits, 
accompanied solely by lazy, luau 
guitars and brushed drums, deliv-
ering a chorus that is both simple 
and achingly tender. 

Album climax “Satisfied” — 
a tongue-in-cheek Waits-rock 

response to the Rolling Stones’ “I 
Can’t Get No” — is simultaneously 
a tribute to his peers (Richards also 
appears on the track), and a smil-
ing jab at the ultrastylish genera-
tion to which he played mysterious 
crackpot uncle. “Mr. Jagger and Mr. 
Richards / I will scratch what I’ve 
been itchin / Before I’m gone,” Waits 
growls partway through.

It’s a bold statement at an age 
where most fading legends are 
prone to “cute” and “nostalgic” 
deathbed releases, but Waits has 
never really been one to embrace 
subtlety. With an album brimming 
with as much youthful passion and 
creativity as Bad as Me, he has no 
reason to.

A fter five solid albums and a three-year break, Anthony Gonzalez (aka M83) returns 
with a vast, enriched sound on 
Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming — an 
epic double LP in which the song-

writer tones down the reverb in 
favor of a kind of retro space-pop.

Slightly tweaking the more 
ambient-pop sound of past jams 
like “Run Into Flowers,” tracks 
such as first single “Midnight City” 
layer energetic synths, danceable 
basslines and delicate, ghastly 
harmonies on top of Anthony 
Gonzalez’s usual wall of drone. This 
early track — a solid, infectious 
pop gem — provides a break from 
the denser soundscapes Gonzales 
returns to later in the album.

“Wait” utilizes these sound-
scapes — or indiscernible layers 
of reverb —  while easing into soft 

acoustic guitar chords and floating 
synth bleeps, making for a melan-
choly slow dance.  Beck producer 
Justin Meldal-Johnsen interjects 
orchestral moments that meld per-
fectly with Gonzalez’s tender, echo-
ing vocals.

Transitioning straight into 
“Raconte-Moi Une Histoire,” 
Gonzalez lays a vocal sample of a 
young girl expressing her color-
ful imagination over simple synth 
loops and a steady, snapping beat. 
The strong imagery is reminiscent 
of some lost home video, simultane-
ously eerie and gorgeous — a spot-
on recreation of childhood emotion.

Latter tracks like “OK Pal” adopt 
the sounds of the greatest in ’80s 
pop; Genesis’ reverbed harmonies, 
DEVO’s funky synth riffs and 
Spacemen 3’s muffled, oscillating 
keyboards all reinforce the hazy 
memory of a first love.

On Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming, 
M83 marks its strongest collec-
tion to date, affirming not only 
Gonzalez’s prowess in electronic 
production, but also his promis-
ing move into charming, cohesive 
songwriting.

scoreless up until the 89th minute.
With the clock winding down, freshman forward 

Cassie Callahan won the ball in Dominguez’s half. 
Callahan played a flighted ball to senior forward 
Courtney Capobianco, who deftly chipped it over 
the Dominguez keeper to win the game.

Capobianco — who has played in only nine of 
UCSD’s 14 matches and has not recorded a start 
this season — has become something of a supersub 
for the Tritons. The goal against CSU Dominguez 
Hills puts her in second behind McTigue for goals 
scored this year. 

Capobianco’s game-winner also ended an offen-
sive drought, in which UCSD had failed to score for 
the past three matches.

“It was nice to put the game away in regula-
tion,” Armstrong said. “[McTigue] and [Wethe] 

stressed that we need to make the most out of every 
minute in every match, and put a little faith in our 
forwards.”

With a 9-1-4 record overall (8-1-3 in the CCAA) 
and four games left in conference play, the Tritons 
are looking forward to the post-season.

“We’ve positioned ourselves pretty well for the 
rest of the season,” Armstrong said. “We’re not 
going to overlook Humboldt. They’re a team that 
has nothing to lose, and can always surprised you, 
but we are gearing up for what we know will be an 
important game against Sonoma.”

UCSD will host Humboldt State on Friday, Oct. 
21 at 4:30 p.m. before their match against top of the 
North conference Sonoma State on Sunday, Oct. 23 
at 12 p.m.

ley off a pass from freshman forward Franco Cruz, 
bringing the score to 3-1.

    UCSD was only outshot by the Golden Eagles 
16 to 13, but the Tritons struggled in the attack 
with the loss of sophomore forward Sam Ball, who 
was forced to sit out against CSU Los Angeles after 
he accrued five yellow cards in his 12 conference 
matches.

The Golden Eagles netted another goal before the 
end of the game, as did UCSD’s sophomore forward 
Tsuk Haroush, but it wasn’t enough to collect a win.

“We missed ours and they made theirs,” Pascale 
said. “We tried to get back into it with a goal, but 
[CSU Los Angeles] was just a much better team than 
we were tonight.”

The Tritons fell to CSU Dominguez Hills on 
Sunday in much the same way. 

UCSD went down by three goals in the first half 
and were outshot by CSU Dominguez Hills 10-5.

After allowing three goals and recording only 
one save — denying Dominguez Hills a penalty kick 
— UCSD goalkeeper Brennan was replaced in favor 
of sophomore goalkeeper Josh Cohen. Statistically, 
Cohen fared better, recording three saves while 
keeping the net clean for the remainder of the game.

The Tritons had a difficult time in the attacking 
third as well. UCSD couldn’t seem to break down the 

Toro backline, which played up high and smothered 
forwards Ball and junior Evan Walker.

UCSD continued to push and with 10 minutes 
left were granted a penalty kick. Sophomore mid-
fielder Cory Wolfrom converted from the spot.

Less than a minute later, junior midfielder Alex 
Portela sent a free kick to the feet of sophomore 
defender Alec Arsht who put the ball past CSU 
Dominguez Hills goalkeeper, bringing the Tritons to 
within one with nine minutes left to play.

“The guys started slow and dug themselves a 
hole, and did well to fight to get out of that,” assistant 
coach Eric Bucchere said. “But against a good team 
you find that that’s just not enough.”

With a 6-8-0 overall record (5-7-0 in the CCAA) 
and only four games left in conference play, the 
Tritons will be hard-pressed for a post-season berth.

“Looking forward we’re just trying to improve,” 
Bucchere said. “We’re going to use these next four 
games as opportunities for growth and to get bet-
ter. We’re going to try and plug away and play the 
spoiler.”

The Tritons will face off against bottom of the 
league Humboldt State on Friday, Oct. 21 at 7 p.m. 
On Sunday, Oct. 23, UCSD will look for the upset 
against top-ranked Sonoma State.

the late ’80s with its GSXR-750, the first 
fully faired “race bike with lights” that 
has become commonplace with other 
manufacturers since. But in recent years 
Suzuki has started pulling back from 
what it created, making sports bikes with 
the best blend between ergonomics and 
rider comfort, sacrificing some of the 
rider’s ability to rage around corners and 
down straightaways.

Following this trend, and the fact 
that the manufacturer did not import 
any bikes to the U.S. for 2011 due to the 
economic recession, there are fears that 
Suzuki will be pulling its support from 
Rizla Suzuki, its factory racing team in 
MotoGP. 

While Ducati has had Valentino Rossi 
and Nicky Hayden testing the GP12, and 
Honda has had Stoner on the RC213V, 
Suzuki has reportedly not been working 
on a new bike for the 1000cc rule change 
next year. While MCN.com has reported 
that negotiations within Suzuki are “posi-
tive” and that the company would like to 
remain in the series, there have been no 
promises. 

The trend of manufacturers dropping 
out of MotoGP is not new. As recently as 
2009, Kawasaki’s “Team Green” MotoGP 
team was pulled, leaving local San Diegan 
John “Hopper” Hopkins without a bike 
and temporarily ending his MotoGP 
career. Aprilia also dropped out in 2004 
and Ilmor dropped in 2007 after only 
two years of competing. In every case, 
the manufacturer failed on the racetrack 
and followed with poor sales, forcing a re-
budgeting program that wound up cut-
ting the MotoGP branch of the company.

In the 2011 season Rizla Suzuki did 
not have a good year, beginning when 
their only team rider, Alvaro Bautista, 
broke his femur in a practice session 
in the opening race at Qatar. Following 
a string of poor 12th place finishes, 
Bautista did get his confidence back up 
to finish 5th at Silverstone. However, he 
crashed in two races in a row at Laguna 
Seca and Brno, then again at Motegi and 
in slippery conditions at Philip Island. 

This has left Alvaro and Rizla Suzuki in 
12th place, the lowest factory team in the 
series.

These lackluster results certainly do 
not inspire a racing following, and the 
bigwigs at Suzuki may be thinking that 
with its team doing so poorly and sales 
doing relatively well in spite of this, they 
can cut their factory sponsorship and 
maintain sales. While it is true that their 
middleweight bikes, the GSX-R 600 and 
750, have had great success thanks to 
their 2011 full redesign, the Suzuki’s flag-
ship liter bike actually has the lowest sales 
of the big four Japanese manufactur-
ers. With most new sports bikes sold as 
liter bikes — the reason why BMW has 
decided not to produce a middleweight 
as a step down from the barn-storming 
S1000RR — this does not bode well for 
Suzuki.

A new 1000cc MotoGP bike from 
Suzuki would excite fans and would help 
Suzuki catch back up with the competi-
tion’s standard ABS and with the stronger 
engines in the liter bike class. New tech-
nology from 1000cc MotoGP bikes (cur-
rently 800cc) would almost bolt on parts 
as per the new rules for 2012. Quitting 
MotoGP for Suzuki, in the coming year, 
would be a major step in the wrong 
direction. 

With a lagging flagship, uninspired 
performance and sluggish steering 
reflected in its MotoGP race bike — 
the GSV-R — Suzuki needs to stay in 
MotoGP for 2012. Despite the relatively 
strong sales overall, the lack of a standout 
liter bike may spell disaster, although 
MotoGP is the perfect place to develop 
new parts for its next offering. If suc-
cesses such as Yamaha’s R1 cross-plane 
technology, Honda’s V4 engines in the 
early nineties or Ducati’s traction control 
system are not evidence enough of tech-
nological revamping, Suzuki should look 
back to its own “race bike with lights” 
roots.

The bottom line is: the company that 
made the original superbike needs to stay 
in MotoGP to remain successful in the 
field they created over 20 years ago.

High performance racing has long been both a brand marketing opportunity as well as a hotbed for advancing motors-
port technology and development. Motorcycling 
particularly benefits directly from advanced 
technologies initially developed for MotoGP, 
the premier motorcycle racing category. This is 
because a person is 10 times more likely to track 
his or her bike after buying a sports bike than 

after buying a Camaro or a Ford, and for good 
reason. Sports bikes, percentage-wise, are nearer 
in horsepower and handling capabilities to their 
big brother race bikes. 

The 2012 MV Agusta F4 has a 1000cc v4 
engine putting out a claimed 201 horsepower 
while the Honda RC212V racebike Casey Stoner, 
2012 MotoGP world Champion, rode to victory 
this past weekend at Philip Island, Australia, has 
an 800cc v4 engine with 207 horsepower. Across 
the manufacturing board this fun fact holds true, 
whether you look at a Yamaha R1, Suzuki GSX-R 
1000, or a BMW S1000RR. True race bikes are a 
mere 10k away from being in Joe Smo’s hands, so 
the opportunity to say my bike beat your bike this 
past weekend in MotoGP or AMA Superbike, is 
much closer to home than, say with NASCAR. 
In the Sprint Cup Series, the cars put out 850-
900 horsepower, nowhere near what Chevy, 
Ford, or Dodge sell in their showrooms. 

Manufacturers of sports motorcycles histori-
cally have concentrated on winning races with 
bikes as close as possible to what can be sold on 
dealership floors. Suzuki has traditionally led 
the pack in this respect, pioneering the field in

UCSD Suffers First Loss

One goal decided both games against CSU Los Angeles and CSU Dominguez Hills this weekend.
In the midst of a 12-game undefeated 

streak — the longest since 1994 — the UCSD 
women’s soccer team dropped its first game 
1-0 this season against No. 20 CSU Los 
Angeles on Friday in overtime.

“It was a tough way to lose, but the chanc-
es were there for us to win the game, and we 
just weren’t brave enough to win the game, 
simple as that,” head coach Brian McManus 
said. “Unless you’re willing to be brave, and 
put your body in where it hurts, you’re not 
going to win. They were brave enough. They 
went hard into tackles. We didn’t.”

Despite McManus’ misgivings, the Tritons 
still managed to play the soccer that has got-
ten them to the top of the league: getting the 
ball on the ground, moving it around the 
pitch and outshooting the Golden Eagles 
14-8. All the team missed was composure in 
front of the net.

“We only fell apart once during the game,” 
senior goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong said. 
“But it forced us to realize that we just need 
to finish our scoring opportunities.”

The Tritons came close a number of times 
in the 94 minutes of play. Near the start of 
the game, 5’10” junior forward Gabi Hernandez won the ball in the air, 
connecting with senior forward Sarah McTigue. Just feet in front of the 
goal, McTigue misfired and sent the ball over the crossbar.

UCSD suffered another near miss with just five minutes remaining 
in the regulation time period, when junior midfielder Danielle Dixon 
collected the ball just outside of the 18-yard box. Dixon sent a lofted 
shot that would have beat CSU Los Angeles keeper Jesse Walworth — if 
the ball hadn’t struck the crossbar. The score then remained drawn 0-0.

In the fourth minute of overtime, CSU Los Angeles forward Cari 
Gill collected the ball on the right side of UCSD’s goal box. Gill sent a 
cross that saw its way through the Triton defense and found forward 

Gabbi Segall, who put a left-footed finish past Armstrong.
“[The loss] could be a season breaker, it’s as simple as that,” 

McManus said after the game. “We’ve put ourselves in a deep hole with 
the two games last weekend and this weekend, and we haven’t turned 
out to play.”

Safe to say, McManus was unhappy with the result, but despite 
Friday’s loss, UCSD still stood at the top of the conference with their 
No. 6 ranking intact going into the game on Sunday.

But against the Toros, McManus’ squad looked as if they 
would be heading into overtime again, as the game remained

Tritons Drop Fourth Straight

By Rachel Uda
Sports Editor

Against nationally-ranked opposition, the UCSD men’s soccer team dropped two more games this weekend. Despite 
the losses, the Tritons remain in fourth place 
in the South Division standings, but the team 
is now eight points behind third place CSU 
Los Angeles and with very little hope of a 
postseason appearance.

On Friday, UCSD allowed three early goals 
against No. 13 CSU Los Angeles. The Tritons 
fought back to a 4-2 finish, but were unable to 
overcome the deficit.

“The result was pretty disappointing,” head 
coach Jon Pascale said. “I think how we 
came out was really disappointing. [CSU Los 

Angeles] is a great team. We needed to be at 
our best, and we weren’t.”

The Golden Eagles went up 1-0 less than 
five minutes into the game, when forward 
Jason Swope got past the Triton backline. 
Swope sent a cross to forward Timo Schwar 
who struck the ball past UCSD sophomore 
goalkeeper Jesse Brennan.

Ten minutes later, CSU Los Angeles put 
the game at 2-0, scoring off a counter attack 
started from a punt from CSU Los Angeles 
goalkeeper Waleed Cassis. The Golden Eagles 
stretched their lead to three with a well-struck 
ball from 20 yards out in the 34th minute.

Just before half time, sophomore midfield-
er Andisheh Bagheri finished a left-footed vol-

Triton Golf Finishes Ninth
By Rachel Uda
Sports Editor

The UCSD men’s golf team traveled up to Corning, Calif. on Tuesday, Oct. 18 to compete in the Lindsey Olive 
Wildcat Classic.  

The Tritons finished the two-day tour-
nament in ninth place out of the 16 teams 
(representing Division II, Division III, and 
NAIA).

UCSD sent a young squad up to Corning: 
three sophomores and two freshmen.

Sophomore Lewis Simon was the Tritons’ 
top finisher, shooting a combined total of 229 
in the three rounds. 

Sophomore David Smith finished in sec-
ond for the Tritons with a combined score 
of 234, while freshman Jay Lim shot a total 
of 234.

“Obviously, there’s lots of room for 
improvement,” assistant coach Keith Okasaki 
said. “The course was pretty tough, the wind 
was blowing around 30 mph, and the team 
that won is one of the top teams in the nation. 
But our team’s pretty young, with three soph-
omores and two freshmen and we’re going to 
keep looking to improve.”

No. 5 Chico State’s senior All-American 
Kyle Souza was the tournament’s top indi-
vidual finisher, while the Wildcats also won 
the team competition finishing 20 strokes 
above second place Grand Canyon. 

UCSD returns to the green next Monday 
and Tuesday on Oct. 24-25, to compete in 
Seaside, Calif. at the Cal State Monterey Bay 
Otter Invitational.
