Triton Staff Votes to Leave Editor 
Position Open; Review Requested 

by Robert~ Rehm 

The staff of the Triton Times has decided to leave the 
office of Editor - in - Chief vacant pending a review of 
the recent dismissal of David Buchbinder from the post 
by Chancellor McElroy. 

Buchbinder has reque~ted that George Murphy, Vice 
~~ancellor for AcademIc Affairs, formally review his 
ftrl ng . He has also contacted the American Civil 
Liberties Uni?n and is contemplating legal action . 

At a ~eetlng yesterday morning, the Triton Times 
staff . decIded to refrain from electing a new editor 
pending the outcome of these actions. 

Dnid Buchbinder 

McElroy was contacted by the T.T and responded 
that the paper "had every right" to decide to leave the 
post vacant and that it was "their business" to decide 
how to react to Buchbinder's firing . He added that "the 
staff should make their recommendations to the 
Communications Board" and any response to their 
actions is up to the Board . . 

.In an effort to better represent the total campus , the 
Tnton Times is re-organizing its news department . An 
associate city editor with several staff persons working 
for them will be elected to represent each college . 

Chancellor McElroy dismissed Buckbinder following a 
wave of controversy generated by the T.T. April Fools 
Edition. On April 2 several articles, which according to 

l3uc~binder , were intended to be satirical attacks on the 
University administration were construed to be racially 
biased and insensitive to minority tudents. Provosts Joe 
Watson (Third College) and John Stewart (Muir College) 
the Black Student Union , and several Third College 
students contacted the Communications Board to 
protest the edition .

Editorial 
Ch~ncellor McElroy hu ordered the dismisyl of the 
Editor - in - Chief of the Triton Times, beouse of the 
p~per's ~lIeged "insensitivity to people of color." The 
Triton Times sees this u ~n ilHempt to ~void this issue 
by il dr~m~tic ~ction of meilningless import. Inste~d of a 
c~refully thought out pl~n to help the Triton Times 
overcome its insensitivity, the ~dministr~tion h~s 

hypocrytic:~lIy tried to person~lize the f~ilings of the TT 
into those of Dnid Buchbinder. 

This sort of ~ction is che~p ~nd dr~m~tic ~nd h~s ~s 
its only go~1 to ~55ure the smooth functioning of the 
Univenity, ~nd not to help the Triton Times change. 
Inste~d it is destructive ilnd divisive to the Triton Times. 
While we ~gree th~t the ch~rges of insensitivity ~re v~lid 

~nd we welcome help to overc6me this severe defect 
nevertheless we see the Chilncellor's ilCtions ilS ilr: 
bitrilry, insincere, ~nd insulting to the people of in-
telligence. 

It is il serious ilction to condemn the Triton Times for 
insensitivity ilnd then to fire the editor - in - chief; it is ~ 
dilngerous precedent ilnd reveills iln intoler~ble 
situiltion. The Triton Times cillls for the restructuring of 
the CommuniCiltions BOilrd in such il Wily ~s to remove 
power from the ildministr~tion and plilCe it in the hands 
of il less ilrbitrilry ilnd more represent~tive commiHee 

th~n the CommuniCiltions Board. We ask for the support 
and help of North St~r, Prensa Popul~r, ilnd Radio KSDT 
in opposing such arbitr~ry ilnd destructive actions in the 
future . 

Saltman Will Speak On 
Pre-Med Student at UCSD 
Dr. Paul Saltman will 

speak on "The Pre-Medical 
Student at UCSD," in a two 
session course to be offered 
April 18 and 25 . 

Both sessions will be 
held from 6 to 8 p .m . in 
room 2250 of Muir 2D(HSS) . 
All freshmen and 
sophomores are en-
couraged to attend . 

Fol~owing Dr . Saltman's 
speech, the session will be 
broken into small groups . 
At least ten senior pre-med 
students wi II act as group 
facilitators , answering 

questions about the ap-
plication procedure for 
medical school and talking 
about their own ex-
periences in applying to 
medical schoo~ 

The medical school years 
will be stressed in the 
second meeting . Dr. Charles 
Spooner, Associate Dean of 
Student Affairs and Ad-
missions at the UCSD 
Medical School will speak. 
His topic will be the current 
admissions picture at 
medical schools in the U.S., 
and the option of a medical" 
school education in a 
different country. 

UCSD Wants Heart Center 
Jean Parks , Pre-Med 

counselor with the Career 
Planning and Placement 
Office, is organizing the 
course. She stated, in a 
recent interview, "We're 
trying to help students see 
themselves better, and to 
give them some tools with 
which they can do some 
self assessment . One of the 
reasons we're. ..having this 
course for freshmen and 
sophomores is to give 
students a chance to decide 
for themselves whether 
they see themselves as a 
candidate. 

by John T~ylor 
UCSD is one of nine areas in the 

United States under consideration for the 
e tablishment of a center for the study of 
heart and lung ailments . 

The university has supplied, on in-
vitation from the National Heart and 
lung Association (NHIA), to the federal 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a 
$13 million grant, which would fund the 
center for five years . 

If located here, the National Research 
and Demonstration Center in Car-
diopulmonary Disease would be housed 
in a remodeled area of University 
Hospital . 

C~t~lyst 

According to UCSD Professor of 
Medicine John Ress who would co-
direct the center alC;;ng with Professor 
Daniel Steinburg, the role of the UCSD 
chool of Medicine would be as a 

" atalyst", to involve area hospitals and 
doctors in education at the center . He 
. aid Med School students would not be 
Involved In tralnln, at the facility . 

"The Center is intended to encompass 
basic research programs, clinic research 
and application programs, "He said . " It 
would bring new clinical techniques to 
the bedside ." He added, "What we plan 
to do with the center is to reach the 
public through the existing 
organizations , such as the Heart 
Association, the lung Association and 
the Smoking Research Institute." 

An evaluation team from the National 
Heart and Lung Association will visit the 
campus in a week and a half to deter-
mine whether UCSD is suitable for the 
center . 

A planning and policy committee has 
been established in anticipation of 
having the center here, and in a meeting 
last Thursday members discussed how 
the center Would relate to surrounding 
hospitals . 

According to Ross, UCSD's chance of 
having the center are "pretty good"-a 
decision is expected in June, but funds 
may not be available until this summer or 
next . 

Parks reports that 
although only about one-
third of all students who 
apply to medical school 
across the country are 
accepted, UCSD students 
have a much better record 
About 90 percent of all 
UCSD tudents with GPA 
of 36 or abovE' who apply 
to med school are ac-
CE'pted Over 50 percent of 
all those who apply with 3 4 
or 35 average are ac-
cepted 

Apparent Suicide 
At Revelle Friday 

The body of a UCSD graduate student was found at 
Revelle Friday after a custodian found an apparent 
suicide note tucked in a door of the HumanItIes 
building. 

University police found the body of VIctor Munoz , 
25, a graduate student in Biology, at 1140 pm Friday 
on the north plaza ofthe CI uster I library. According to 
Paul West, campus information director, several empty 
beXtles were found in the area of the body, contain ing 
traces of a liquid solution . The county coronor's office 
told the Triton Times that investigations as to the 
contents of the bottles and the cause of Munoz' death 
are still pending. 

Munoz, who listed his residence as Solana Beach 
came to UCSD from Venezuela on a scholarship frorr: 
the Venezuelian Institute for SCIentific Investigat ion 
Last Wednesday, said West , Munoz had requested that 
the registra~ 's office send his transcript back to his hom e 
coun try, indicating to offici als that he Intended to leave

I POLlTIJS:' JAMES SO TO I 
Democrats Squabble 

Democrats in California and in the nation have an 
historical tendency to fight among themselves during 
primaries and conventions in such a manner that the 
Republicans could often coast to victory in November. 

This year appears to be no different than the past and 
with almost two months to go before the June primary 
the Democratic gubernatorial candidates are dragging 
each other into a campaign of slurs and accusations . 
The frontrummer , Secretary of State Edmund C . Brown 
Jr., has received the brunt of pressure from his 
democratic colleagues . 

The major issue before the Democrats right now is 
money . The big complaints are that Brown and to a 
lesser extent Mayor Joseph Alioto have too much 
money and the other candidates not nearly enough to 
wage effective and honest campaigns. 

Last Friday Jerome Waldie and attorney Herb Hafif 
formed a coalition against their big money candidates. 
In a joint statement, Waldie and Hafif said the 
democratic race "has degenerated into a soap-selling 
contest ." The two underdogs also said the supporters of 
the rival candidates " live in big corporate boardrooms -
they don't work in the fields and factories ." Hafif said , 
"There is no discussion of the issues". This Thursday the 
two democrats will debate at UCLA and have invited 
Brown to join them . 

Earlier this month Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti , 
who currently ranks third in polls, charged Jerry Brown 
with using the Secretary of State's office to prepare a 
booklet which Moretti charged was political rather than 
official. A court order stopped the booklet from going 
out to the 9,000,000 California voters . 

Baxter Ward, Los Angeles County Supervisor and 
former newscaster, has made a special effort to inform 
voters of his reform proposals . In an official statement 
from his campaign office said "Baxter Ward is the only 
candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor 
with more than a verbal commitment to campaign 
financing reform ." 

Baxters Campaign has charged Brown with receiving 
250 donations of S500 or more and nearly 200 gifts of 
$1000 or more . Ward has put a $45 limit on all con-
tributions to his campaign . In the first three weeks of 
Ward's campaign , he has claimed that he has only spent 
$2000. 
Political Notes ..... 

... The AFL 'CIO political arm, COPE, Friday endorsed 
not one but four democrats for governor . Joseph Alioto, 
Edmund C. Brown Jr ., Jerome Wald ie, and Bo b More tti 
received the endorsement of the labor organization 
which theoret ically represents 1.6 mill ion California 
voter s. It had bee n expected that Alioto would receive 
the e ndorsement but the San Fran cisco mayor put the 
blame o n the Cu linary Workers Union president lor 
holdi ng o ut for a blanket support of the Democrat ic 
ticket. State Controller Ho uston Flournoy fail ed in h is 
bid to be endorsed for the COP nomination and At-
torney Ceneral Evelle J. Younger was the only 
Republ ican to receive an endorsement for a statewide 
'Offi ce . 

.. .sta te Senator John Harmer of Clendale, candidate 
for the COP nom ination for lieutenant governor said in 
San Diego Friday that would favor laws to control 
violence in mov ies "i f it could be proved scientif ically it 
hurts t he body politic ." Harmer has gained notice in 
recent years for favoring m o re str ingent pornography 
laws.

McEl roy also s aied that the T.T. had "no mali cious

SIMS, The Students' 

I nternation Mediation 
Society on campus will 
present two Introductory 
Lectures on Transcendental 
Meditation beginnina with 
a survey of the wide range 
of benefits that T .M . 
produces. Proponets of 
T.M. claim that the reason 
these benefits come is from 
the experience of "Tran-
scendental Consciousness," 
a fourth major state of 
consciousness that medical 

researchers in over 80 
institutions around the 
world have described as a 
unique state of RESTFUL-
ALERTNESS. It is different 
from Waking, Dreaming, 
Sleeping, or altered states 
of consciousness like 
hypnosis or biofeedback. 
Research has found 
significant positive results 
in the area of developing 
mental potential, better 
health, smoother social 
relationships, and over all 

self-actualization as 
described by Mazlow. 

These results will 
highlight the first lecture to 
be held this Wednesday 
night, April 17 at 7 :30 p.m . 
in the Revelle Formal 
lounge . 

The followihg Wed-
nesday night will be the 
second lecture in which the 
actual mechanics and 
prinCipals of T.M. will be 
discussed . 

Also there will be an 
academic adviser from the 
Provost's Office to answer 
any questions that you may 
have . This will be a good 
opportunity for all of you to 
meet other Muir College 
students . We hope to see 
you there.

The Bicycle Co-op on campus is going through a 
change in response to students' suggestions. The Bicycle 
Co-op will give way to a student - owned UCSD Bicycle 
Shop which wi II be operated by the UCSD Bicycle Club. 
Services will include labor and parts and bicycles for 
sale, all priced below the going rate off campus. Money 
from the sales will payoff loans, increase inventory, and 
sponsor such activities as overnight bike trips . The Shop 
will open April 15, at the north-east P.E. department 
quonset hut, next to the football field . Hours will be 
from 1:00 to 3:00 everyday : with growing business the 
hours will be improved . The Bicycle Club is working 
intensely to find better location for the Shop, possibly 
on the Muir Campus.

The Most Common Mental Disorder 
by Rich Drom 

Though the worst quarter 
is over, "the most common 
form of mental disorder" 
may be soon hitting UCSD 
again . According to Iims:, 
this c ommon mental 
disorder is depressionj a 
normal emotion ,_especially 
at UCSD. 

Sin ce depression is such a 
human emotion it is not 
s urprising that College 
students should experience 
it. The telling fact is that so 
many students at UCSD 
experience the symptoms 
during the year; particularly 
during the winter quarter . 

Depression is a cognitive 
emotion . Depressed people 
actually think that 
something is wrong rather 
than Simply feel it. But 
often patients are unable to 
describe these feelings of 
intense unhappiness . 

The sym ptoms of 
depression include dif-
ficulty in falling asleep and 
a marked decrease in sexual 
desires . Depressed persons 
generally feel lousy about 
themselves and their futur e, 
but they often hold these 
feelings in and don't express 
them. In extreme cases a 
d e pressed patient wi II 
resemble a walking zombie. 

Why are these symptoms 
readily visible on a college 
campus like UCSD during 
the winter quarter? A recent 
Newsweek issue explained 
it well . 

"January is the time when 
the affliction cuts deepest 
in those who are prone to it: 
the holidays are over, gone, 
and the bright promise of 
Christmas, often painfully 
unfulfilled has given way to 
the bleak reality of the 
winter that lies ahead ." 

This phenomena is so 
common that doctors have 
a name for the winter ' 
quarter blues , " Holiday 
Paradox." Even the most 
well adjusted personalities ' 
sutfer the panas of the 
Holiday Paradox. In fact 
one doctor went so far as to 
say that "the holidays are 

organized to guarantee 
disappointment ." 

Statistics also back up 
these beliefs . The worst 
days in the year for suicides 
(closely related to 
depression) are the second, 
third and fourth of January. 

Another reason for 
depression to strike at 
UCSD is the very nature of 
its competitive atmosphere . 
Depression has been 
described by some as an 
inevitable consequence of 
intense pre ~ure . It occurs 
when an intensive, hard-
driving person over drives 

person being aware of what 
has happened 

The effects of depression 
range from mild to severe ; 
from a melancholy thought 
to a suicidal action . No one 
can accurately predict what 
affect this "too tight spring" 
will have on a given 
student . Unfortunately the 
effects can be deadly. 

Suicide is the most 
blatant act of a depressed 
person . One reason, for an 
attempt, is to call out to 
others to tell them how the 
depressed person feels . 

Patients also have a desire 
to punish themselves for 
what they think is their 
"failing ." At the same time 
they feel that suicide will 
offer them some relief from 
their sufferings . 

What can be done for the 
depressed person? In .the 
hands of a professional the 
chances are 95 percent that 
he can be cured. This 
encouraging fact must be 
compared to the medical 
estimate that 4 to 8 million 
Americans suffer from

himself . His nervous system ,---------------------, 
just won 't turn off . 

It is thus no wonder that 
when mid-terms and finals 
hit, depression builds up at 
UCSD. Pre-meds or not , 
many students drive 
themselves so hard that 
they can't "cool down ." A 
common feeling among 
students, rightly so, is that 
their brains have melted 
down . In effect, they have .

Th. Front Page 
"No one was injured last Friday when a fire failed to 

break out in Tioga Hall." 
It isn't the same thing at all. I had' just finished 

brousing through "The Newswriter's Handbook", by 
M.l. Stein, having thoroughly digested the section on 
spo~ news stories and memorized the list of suggested 
ques\ions : 

"Were there any deaths or injuries? If so, how many 
and are the victim's names and addresses available~ 

"To what hospital were the injured taken~ 
"Is arson suspected? (In case of a fire .) 
"How much police and fire manpower and equipment 

are at the scene?" 
And so on . Therefore, I was very nearly thrilled when 

the alarm in Tioga Hall went off the other night. Not 
that I wanted anyone to be hurt, or any of the 
University's nice buildings to g~t burned up, but I 
wanted at least a chance to answer the questions, or just 
a chance to show someone my Triton Times Press Card, 
which no one has ever seen because no one has ever 
asked to ee it. But when I got there, I remembered M.l. 
Stein 's words : "The scene of a news spot story is usually 
a highly charged one whether it be an automobile 
accident, mine disaster , murder, fire, riot or plane 
c rash." A comparison provided my first clue, because 
e veryone from the two dorms was, well , standing 
a round in a highly uncharged manner in their 
bathrobes , waiting to be readmitted to the buildings. 
"Police, ambulance men , and other officials are making 
their way through a crowd of bystanders who frequently 
hamper their efforts." There was no one making his way 
anywhere, and no one was hampering him . There was, I 
felt , no fire , and I dejectedly began to walk home until I 
saw a flashing red light in the street . 

It was one fire truck . Around it stood six firemen , who 
looked, respectively, up at the building, down at the 
ground, over at the highly uncharged crowd , at the fire 
truck, at a clip board, and at nothing at all. There were 
no flames, nor was there smoke, and Cleo was walking 
a round in bare feet, muttering. These, then, were seven 
people of whom I would not choose to ask the question 
"Were there any deaths or injwies? If so, ate the victim 's 
names and addresses available?"[ the latter part of the 
question , by the way, is to let the reporter know where 
to get a recent photograph of the victim. "Hello . Your 
on was just burned up. Do you have a recent 

photograph?" Something like that} . The nonasking of 
the injuries or deaths question pre€luded the asking of 
the other questions (re : hospitals and arsqn-I could see 
the answer to the last question : one truck, six firemen, 
and Cleo). so I asked one of the dorm residents my own 
question 

"Uh , was there any kind of a fire here or anything?" 
"He ll no . Shit. " He walked away from me . I thought 

a bout showing him my Triton Times Press Card, but 
decided he'd think I was trying to impress him . 

I figured I'd done enough reporting for that evening, 
so I went home and wrote the lead that began this 
column, following every lead rule in the "Writer's 
Handbook ." But it seemed I was using the wrong ap-
proach. and switched to the human interest angle. Since ' 
I hadn't asked enough questions for the human interest 
a ngle, and since everyone had by then returned to their 
perfectly unharmed dormitories, I went to bed.

may not receive any help at 
all. 

The cures are of two 
basic kinds; chemical and 
electrical. Depression has 
been traced to actual 
biological changes in the 
brain and body. These can 
be attacked directJy by 
drugs. One of the most 
common and fairly ef-
fective of these is lithium 
salts . These same salts are,

What about UCSD? 
Perhaps the best single 
action that can be taken is 
to inform students about 
depression, its symptoms, 
causes and cures . If its 
symptoms could be 
diagnosed sooner and 
understood by students, 
real progress would have 
been made to combat it. 

Depression will probably 
continue to occur at UCSD 
as long as the atmosphere 
of study does not c hange 
(providing that lithium salts 
are not put in the c afeteria

comforting fact for UCSD 
comes from the ~ ar-
ticle. In a wierd way it 
confirms the excellence of 
UCSD bec ause "depression 
IS an illness of the ablest".

'SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH CLAIMING YOU AND NIXON AS DIPINDINTS?' 

On the Science of Creative Stupidity:A Proposal 
by I. 

This is a serious article and you are not supposed to 
laugh . If you think that I am going to bitch about the 
whole constellation of gurus. maharajis. yogas. bam-
boos etc . that plagued the scene during the years that 
the antiwar movement was alive (the war in S.E. Asia is 
sti ll going on) you are wrong. 

Although the SCS is a course that won 't be tdught at 
the " Maharaji 's International Uni ,.a~ rsity" which ad-
vocates the SCI (I for Intelligence not for Idiocy as you'd 
suspect). I think the UC system should start a com-
pulsory 4-year course on the SCS. Why? Because it is the 
force that has kept humankind moving. For do you tl1ink 
we'd be in this state if we had not had a good dose of 
stupidity? Do you thi nk we would have invented 
religions-from the very primitive ones which had lots 
of alcohol. sex. cannibalism and lots of fun. to the very 
modern ones in which the opposite is enforced. 

How else would you explain people not being op-
posed to being led like sheep to kill each other in en-
dless wars? How else would you explain governments 
spending more on devising all sorts of means of 
destruction instead of looking for ways of preventing 
warsl You certainly have noticed how people act l ike 
robots receiving commands from the media . They are 
told what they need. consequently what to buy and 
where to buy it : they are to ld how to dress. how to 
speak . what to think . Why do the people go along with 
it? 

And what about the famous SCI? It teaches us to 
believe that the problems we are confronted with are 
due not to the fact that we live in a crazy and irrational 
society. but as if these prqblems were all in our f!1inds . 
The reason one has to learn how to transcendentally 
meditate is for its deconstipative effect; for one would 
become so anxious about it that there would be no way 
of going regularly to the toilet . And if the authorities in 
this country don't want to pass on to history the 
respon si bility for stopping. maiming, thwarting the 
normal line of development of humankind, then they 
should give the utmost serious consideration to my 
proposal . They should pull all levers available in order 
to have even every nursery school teach some aspect of 
the SCS In their curriculum . 

What can be achieved with it? 

April Fool 

by I.M. Beeil 

To begin with , we'd all be very happy-after having 
had a course in SCS- to give half of our sa laries to 
upport the "governments" of South Vietnam, South 

Korea, Phillipines, Mozambique. South Africa. Brazi l, 
Greece. Chi le. etc . We'lI happily stand In line again for 
gas, and believe all sort s of apologists for this stupid 
social system like Fred Bill Stoneheart. We'd even go 
along with him in saying that people have already 
dumped Nixon enough . W e'd be dumb enough not to 
notice that the people have had nothing to do wi th the 
current att~mpt to get rid of Nixon even when the heat 
of Waterage is off ; too dumb to notice the powerful 
interests behind all these events. 

Fancy what would happen if people's consciousness 
continued to rise slowly. more and more people coming 
to understand 'what the issues shaping thei r lives rea lly 
are ! Somebody once sai d : "Only idiots and saints are 
happy." Thus say I also. Imagine all the happiness and 
bliss and even ecstasy that this University would bring 
to those poor students who for hours si t on the grass 
getting their brains roasted by the sun which makes 
finished morons out of them. Chances are that left 
unchecked, the students might become aware of 
poverty and racism and exploitation instead of worrying 
about thei r Weight or shape, or what to wear for the next 
Friday movie, or any other such important thing. 

I magine what might happen if people stopped fussing 
about baseball. basketball. football or any sort of balls, 
and instead began to participate in decidi ng o n the 
issues that affect them . What if they start to question 
the value of your academic endeavors? Think of it and 
shudder. 

I hope now that it is v ry clear in your heads that for 
your own good what we need here are courses in : TV-
watching , gossiping , religion (compulsory every 
quarter), group-sunbathing, patriotism, all sorts of 
chauvini ms (without chauvinism Americans would 
become humorless), etc. 

Let me not go on . Instead I shall invite those who 
know the va lue of goodhearted, down-to-earth-
stupidity, to propose a curri culum for SCS and submit 
them for publication to this paper (in the interests of 
onsistency). And remember. the motto is not: " I think. 

therefore I am ." It is : " I am . therefore I am not." 

Letters to the Editor 

of expression if this is the 
case. I hope that you will 
not over-react in a similar 
situation in the future. 

Sincerely, 
Nicholas Papa5iopoulos 

Irate 
Dear Editor, 
This is what is known as 

an !rate letter, so please 
bear with me a moment. I 
am what is laughlingly 
known as an English major 
in a primarily science-
or iented university-an 
unfortunate circumstance 
which has prompted both 
smiles and condescending 
sneers ("What are you 
doing at this school? Why 
don' t you go to State where 
you belong,,,) The fact 
remains that I shell out my 
212 bucks just like the rest 
of you, and I should think 
that that entitles me to 
expect at least a 
reasonable choice of class 
offerings ' 

If you'll look in your 
schedule of classes for this 
quarter , you' II notice that 
there are a grand total of 
six upper division English 
classes offered. And you 
will further notice that 
three of these are 
seminars, which are by 
definition limited to only 
fifteen students . Assuming 
that you don't want (or 
couldn't take) one of these, 
that limits the number of 
classes to three. Of these 
three, one class is very 
selective in its subject 
matter . and the professor 
made it clear to me befor e 
hand that unless one is 
very interested in 
" Rhetoric" and learning 
how. to write technical 
papers, one should not 
consider taking the class 
(By this I mean to cast no 
aspersions on Prof.Burke-
I know and respect him. 
and realize the need for 
such a class, but as he 
said, Rhetoric is not for 
everyone!). Well, for all 
you non-math majors, th is 
leaves a total of TWO 
regular sized English 
classes for this quarter . 

I don't have the statistics 
at hand to say how many 
English (and other 
literature) majors there 
are at UCSD, but my ex-
per iences of the last three 
years indicate that there 
are many more students 
interested than can be 
contained in two classes . 
however big (and you have 
to bear in mind that no 
professor wants to teach a 
class with 100 students if 
he is only allowed one or 
two readers to help with 
papers and finals - if any 
at all!). And there are 
many non-Lit majors who 
like to take an English class 
once in a while for an 
elective-how can they 
possibly be fit in? 

letter too lona-there are 
dozens of pie9ances which 
I could brina up-but I'm 
sure that most students in 
Literature and other 
"Liberal Arts" /Social 
Sciences majors have come 
up aga inst problems 
similar to those I've 
mentioned. I can reme.roer 
that ridiculous letter which 
our Provost John Stuart 
sent to the parents of Muir 
students a few months ago! 
He was rejoicinl that the 
period of social unrest and 
student demonstrations of 
the sixties was over (at 
last!), and happy to note 
that students were finally 
getting back to studying 
and learning, like good 
little college students . For 
those of us who might 

.really be interested in 
lear nina a few things I can 
only say, GIVE US A 
CHANCE TO!! 

Sign me a very pissed-
off,

The letters te the opinion page of the last issue of

(incorrectly) P 'lt an editor's note in the paper 
referring the a It}Jors of the letters to the excellent 
analysis of the sItuation put forward on page 10 of

p. 4 Triton Times, April 16, 1974 

Editor, 
I am apalled at the recent 

proceedings and sub-
sequent dismissa l of David 
Buchbinder. Editor of the 
TRITON TIMES. I consider 
these actions repressive and 
over-reactive. 

From the reports of the 
Communication Board 
proceedings, I can only 
conclude that such actions 
were perpetrated with large 
disregard for established 
policies and by-laws. 

I wrote a letter to the 
TRITON TIMES (published 
5 April 1974) condemning 
the April Fool's issue and 
demanding retraction and 
apology In my opinion 

TIM ES . It was never my 
intention to call for or 
support the dismissal of the 
Editor in that letter. or in 
any other communication 
regarding that issue. While I 
sti ll consider the journalism 
in the 2 April 1974 issue 
poor, I do not believe that 
the actions of the TRITON 
TIMES are severe enough to 
call for dismissal of the 
Editor, especially in light of 
the subsequent apo logy and 
clarification published in 
the 5 April issue of the 
TRITON TIMES. 

If my I tter caused in any 
way the dismissal of David 
Buchbinder, I disavow any 
~uch intention and consider 
II an assault on my freedom

Vocal- MovementSeminar 

Mime-singer-dancer-composer, Margalit Oved wi II 
give a demonstration of her art, Friday. April 19, at noon 
in 409. MC, in a seminar sponsored by the UCSD Music 
Department. 

MISS Ovid combines orignal vocalizations with 
movement to tell tales of her past in Israel , tales of 
human emotions and universal needs -or anything else 
that moves her lively imagination . At times Miss Ovid 
<Iccompanies her interpretations on drums. tam-
bou rines, gongs and electronic tape. But mostly it is her 
mobile face which changes from youthful glow to a 
wrinkled mask, her hands that si ng and dance, legs that 
emerge as animals and her vOice that is music which 
make the s enes come to life for audience and par-
ti c ipal1ts alike . 

Margalit Ovid was born in Aden, " the hottest place in 
the world". in the country of Yemen From there her 
many talents have taken her to Paris, Rome. Australia. 
the Netherlands, New York and many other art centers 
all over the world . The public is welcome to attend the 
demonstration . 

The PE Department will be sponsoring a Master 
Dance Class following the Lecture-Demonstration . It 
wi ll be held in the Main Gym from 2:3()..4 p .m . Ad-
mission $2 .00. For any information regarding the Dance 
Class contact Renee X2286.

Wi th Jani~ Joplin gonE'. and 
Grace Slick's voice fading away 
slowly but surely. som ebody's got 
to emerge and try to ta ke over the 
female white blues singer bag. And 
latest among the trek of hopefuls is 
Maggie Bell. formerly lead singer 
for Stone the Crows, and more 
recently in public spot li ght playing 
the Mother in the symphonic 
rendition of Tommy. 

Her first solo album is a solid 
start proving that she's got a nice 
strong throaty voice. which is 
capable of producing a lot of gut 
without having to push herself . The 
Joplin influence in terms of that 
whiskey bar female vocalist is 
apparant, and she wears it well . 

The album puts her through a 
variety of paces, from slow blues, 
to pop rock (a superior rendition 
of Ringo's " Oh My My" to in-
teresting arrangements of a number 
like J. J. Ca le's "After Midnight." 

The start is certainly a fine one. 
The album is good listening, with a 
good set 'of studio musicians giving 
her a ni ce base to si ng around . The 
direction is clear . With a gutsier set 
of tunes on her next album. Maggie 
Bell may well be on her way to 
female blues superstardom.

feeling, [Ivis has hiS sf'x ual

remember .), and Donovan had thiS 
sort of flower power feel that 
emerged in the mid-60·s. 

Well . things aren 't as Mellow 
Yellow as they used to be and so 
Donovan is tredding in a turf less 
friend ly then he used to be. So 
what's he got going for him? 

Well, Donovan has always had a 
neat sort of voice, and a good sense 
of the ballad and fantasy in his 
songs, and he's always used hiS 
instruments well . On this album 
he's in excellant music company,

me a flower on the street and said 
" Peace .. love" . Remember free 
love? Remember when that was

and try to relate to lyri cs like ' 

"For every up there is a down 
For every smile there is a sad 

frown 
For every lip there is a kiss 
For every cheek there is a caress" 
or how about this for a chorus: 
" I don 't want to be rushed and

Titles like "Operating Manual for

Arthur Miller's "The Price, " a play about the feelings 
between two brothers. opened April 10 at the Cassius 
Carter Center Stage of the Old Globe Theatre. Miller 
emphasizes dialogue in this play to the extent that for 
two and one half hours we do little but watch people 
talk . There isn 't much action, beyond the marvelous 
entrances and exi ts of the used furniture dealer Gregory 
Solomon (Mark Feder). There are no 'gimm icks' to break 
up the monotony of the unresolvable opposition of two 
brothers in their views of the past. We are forced to feel 
intensely their frustration .

from pushy, dissatisfied wife to a wife who can accept

the play in a way that prevents the abundant dialogue 
from becoming tedious He also does quite \\ ell In

The entire play takes place in one room. a cluttered 
attic we are told. but because we must see this attic in-

of expensive, massive furniture are impracticable . In 
Act I, we wonder at the haggling over the price of such a 
motley collection of junk.

part of Gregory Solomon . His dialect is flawless. as is his 
timing. Of the two brothers, Walter (H . 0 Argenbright) 
IS the stronger. Argenbright is able to capture the se lf-
deceiving sin erity of a successful doctor who has com 
back to make amends for leaving his father to grow old 
and die in the care of his brother . Victor (William 
Quiett) is less materiali tic than his brother, and a more 
dutiful son. Miller writes the role of Victor to make him 
the equa l if not the superior of Walter . William Quiett's

Obscure Sports Dept. 

Becker Exposed 
Due to lack of space and 

other equally legitimate 
excuses the Obscure Sports 
Staff took a well deserved 
vacation last week . Due to 
popular demand we are 
back again this week, 
focusing on a couple of 
water sports, surfing and 
the women's water polo 
team . 

As luck would have it 
Cary Becker is the coach of 
both teams . He is also 
anxious to get all the 
publicity he can for the two 
sports, so herewith is all the 
publicity I can give him. 

by Kirk Robinson 
the results of the season to 
determine funding, etc. If 
there is enough interest in 
the sport there is a good 
chance thiJt water polo, on 
both the men's and 
women's levels will be 
around for a long time to 
come. 

Becker was also quick to 
point out that women in 
intercollegiate athletics is 
one of the growing ac-
tivities on campus, witness 
the women playing rugby, 
basketball, field hockey and 
surfing to mention just a 
few. 

Becker's first comment was 
"the surf team will take on 
the Rugby team in a beer 
drinking contest, coaches 
participating, anytime." 

Here at UCSD there is 
both a women's and men's 
surfing team. The com-
petition is on a low-keyed 
level with the emphasis on 
making new friends and 
having fun . 

UCSD competes in a 
league with about 10 other 
schools, with meets being 
held on the dual and tri-
meet level. There will also 
be a grande finale (i.e. the 
championships) to be held 
at Oceanside at the end of 
the season. 

Crew Needs Body 
The Women's Water Polo 

team is presently suffering 
for bodies (only in quantity, 
not quality) as presently 
there are only seven women 
enjoying the experience of 
participating in the sport of 
waterpolo. 

Becker also noted the 
stick-to-itivness that is 
shown by women in 
athletics. Unlike many men, 
the women who come out 
for a sport generally stay 
with the sport until its 
conclusion . 

Surfing is judged on a 
subjective scale of 1-20, 
with three people serving as 
judges. These people look 
for style, the size of the 
wave, how close the surfer 
is to the white water and 
other assorted details in 
determining the winner. 

Certai n intercollegiate 
sports at UCSD seem to 
suffer acutely from a lack of 
bodies. This lack of per-
sonnel occurs due to 
academic pressure, student 
apathy or a severe lack of 
knowledge that the sport 
even exists on campus . 

When a sport suffers from 
all of the above problems 
one may deduce that there

exists an extreme lack of 
bodies necessary for the 
school 's participation in the 
gen sport . 

To anyone who was 
present at the 1974 San 
Diego Crew Classic it would 
seem obvious that the 
UCSD Crew is one sport that 
could use more bodies to

fi ll in more shells. 
Unfortunately it is too 

late in the season to go 
about soliciting new 
oarsmen for the Crew, but 
due to one of the 
aforementioned problems, 
academic pressure, there 
exists one empty seat in the 
frosh four. 

Academic, pressure, that 
bane of intercollegiate 
athletics has caused one of 
the oarsmen to quit on 
account of grades. It is 
really too bad that at this 
school grades that would 
cause an athlet~at another 
school to sltoitch his 
scholarship from athletic to 
academic ca use UCSD 
athletes to quit the team . 

If you are a freshmen , 
with previous experience as 
a starboard oarsman, the 
UCSD Crew could use you 
right now. It would involve 
four weeks of one's time 
including races . It would 
also put you in great 
physical shape. If you are 
interested call Tim Finnigan 
at 453-6425 or Coach Bill 
Cebur at 488-2508. 

At present Becker is just 
teaching the fundamentals 
of the game to his squad, 
putting the emphasis on 
having fun, not cutthroat 
com petition . 

This year is the first year 
for the Women's Water 
Polo Team . The ad-
ministration is looking at

Back to water polo . 
Becker said that water polo 
isn't as " vicious" as many 
people think. With this in 
mind any female wishing to 
become a member of the 
women's water polo team 
should contact Cary 
Becker.
