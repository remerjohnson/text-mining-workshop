'Burning of the 
Bruin' Divides USC 
LOS ANGELES - The 
University of Southern 
California is having trouble 
deciding how to celebrate 
Troy Week, a week of football 
frenzy that ends with the 
annual UCLA-USC football 
game. The student senate 
voted 10-3 on Sept. 3 to abol-
ish the traditional Troy Week 
practice known as the 
"Burning of the Bruin" due to 
complaints from the Black 
Student Union that the event 
resembles a lynching. 
Traditionally, a human-sized 
stuffed bear, dressed in UCLA 
clothing, would be hung by its 
neck from a noose and then 
lowered into a large bonfire. 
Despite the ban, the College 
Republicans have decided to 
carryon the tradition, and are 
selling bears on nooses and T-
shirts on campus.

Yale to Ban Certain 
Relationships 
NEW HAVEN, Conn . - Yale 
University administrators 
announced last Friday that 
they have decided to ban all 
sexual relationships between 
students and teachers . The rule 
applies to all student-teacher 
relationships, including those 
between students and profes-
sors, students and teaching 
assistants and graduate stu-
dents, and their professors. 
The ban comes a year after a 
Yale sexual -harassment board 
found assistant mathematics 
Professor Jay Jorgenson guilty 
of harassmg a female student 
in one of his classes.

Frats Face Criticism 
CONFLICT: Panhellenic 
council refuses to sponsor any 
Intrafratemity Council events 
By Erika Snider 
Staff Writer 

In an attempt to bettcr police Ihemselves, Ihe 
Intrafraternity Counci l (lFC) and Ihe 
Panhellenic Association took aClion Monday 
against the Delta Sigma Phi and Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon fralernities for recent off-campus inci -
denlS allegedly involving "fighting and gang-
type behavior." 

IFC is an association or 13 campus rraterni-
ties, and Panhellenic is an association of nine 
campus sororities. 

According to Panhellenic President Jaime 
Drozd "a fight and another incident" occurred 
between the two fraternities somewhere orf 
campus last week. As a result of these inci -
dents, seven of the fraternities in Ihe IFC filed

grievances with the group's judicial board 
against the IwO fraternities in question. The 
grievances were filed after the IFe's execulive

"We' re not there 10 pass judgment, we ' re nOI 
there 10 punish anybody. but we're Ihere to 
address the concerns and see what ac tions ",e're

According to the presidenl~ or both associa-

he endured as chancellor in the midM of Ihe stu-
denl revolution of the ' 60s. 

"He took the helm of this very young uni -
versilY in a time of great turmoil and was often 
personally Ihe larget of vitriolic rhetoric ," 
Dynes said. "He was truly a rock in a sea of tur-
moil." 

UC Pres idenl Richard Atkinson, a close 
friend of Dr. McGill , spoke after Dynes. 

"There are three words Ihal describe Bill 
McGill from my perspective: Ihey are inlegrity, 
~c holar!> hip and leadership," Alkinson sa id . 
"On every occasion, every decision, every 
action Ihal he look was guiued by Ihe highe~1 of

a per'>on. 

"He ",as one of my c10sesl friends, and I 
appreciale every moment J spent wi th him,"

Diversity Expert" Jane Elliott 
Educates UCSD Community 
EVENT: A a teacher, 
led brown eyed, blue 
eyed experiment 
By Quyen Tu 
Staff Writer 

Jane Elliott , nati onally 
renowned diversity expert, spoke 
about how different racial groups 
can coexist in America in a presen-
talion entit led '·Brown Eyed, Blue 
Eyed" on Monday in the Price 
Center Ballroom. 

Elliott gained national attention 
in 1968 when she lried to leach her 
third-grade, all-white, all-Christian 
class about what it was like to be a 
racial minority in America the day 
after Martin Luther King 's assassi-
nation. 

On this day, she divided her 
class according to eye color. The 
brown-eyed children were told they 
were superior to the blue-eyed 
ones. As a result , the relationship of 

brown-eyed chi Idren to blue-eyed 
children was similar to that of 
whites to people of color in 
American soc iety. 

The ravoriti~m wa~ reversed the 
next day. 

Elliott said the results of the 
experiment were devastating. The 
blue-eyed students began to believe 
they were inferior and the brown-
eyed ones began to believe they 
were >uperior. 

"I was shocked at how quickly 
my students became what I told 
them they were," Elliot said. ·'1 did-
n't know about the power of 
racism." 

Since that fateful day, Elliott has 
dedicated her life to challenging 
people's racial assumptions. 

"\' ve been offended by racism 
for about 64 years, and by sexism 
for 64 years," Elliott said. "Sexism 
and racism have gone on for far too 
long." 

Elliott said she is convinccd 

that television plays a big role in 
perpetuating the lacism in this 
country. 

" We have all been taught how 
to feel aboul other people as a 
result of watching too much tele -
vision," she said. '·We arc more ..... 
racist in this country a~ a result of • 
television . " 

According to Elliott, children 
learn to be racist in school. 

"A white person who was 
born, raised and schooled in the 
United States of America is con-
ditioned for 12 years 10 the myth 
of white superiority," she said. "A 
person of co lor is taught that 
white people are superior to non-
whites.'· 

Ell iott said that she bel ieves 
white people judge racial-minority 
groups by second-hand experi -
ences. Conversely, she said, people 
of color base their opinions of 
whites on actual expcrience~.

SCIENCE: Chemistry 
Professor Thiemens to 
lead study group 
By Anna Valsman 
Senior Staff Writer 

To put together the pieces of the 
solar system's evolutionary puzzle, 
scienti sts from UCSD and other 
institutions plan to determine the 
composition of the sun by collect-
ing and analyzing samples of solar 
wind from space. 

Once the samples are brought 
back to Earth, UCSD chemistry 
Professor Mark Thiemcns will take 
charge of the project's highest pri-
ority. namely measuring the solar 
wind's oxygen contenl. 

"Nothing like it has becn done

ject, which is part of the Discovery 
program spearheaded by NASA. 

According to current evolution-
ary theory, the solar system began 
as a huge cloud of molecular dust, 
the solar nebula, which formed 
about 4.5 bi Ilion years ago. Part of 
the cloud was unstable and col-
lapsed, forming the sun. 

The rest of the dust swir led 
around and eventually condensed 
in various locations, forming the 
planets . Proportions of isotopes 
lhroughout the solar system 
should therefore mirror those of 
the sun and solar wind, particu-
larly in the amounts of oxygen 
isotopes. 

Isot9pes are different fomls of 
the same clement that vary in their 
numbers of neutrons, one of the 
building blocks of atoms. 

'·Other elements are smaller in 
abundance [than oxygen I." 
Thiemens said. 

"It's a son of chain of infer-
ence," said Jay Bergstralh, a NASA 
Discovery Program scientist. " We 
have been able to name all the ele-
ments in the sun. but not the pro-
portions and isotopes." 

According to Thiemens, analyz-
ing solar wind is like going back in 
time. " Without knowing what you 
staned with, you're complelely in 
the dark." 

To better analyze the substance, 
Thiemens will construct an 
improved, more sensitive mass 
spectrometer, an instrument that 
separates isotopes according to 
their masses. 

The new mass spectrometer is

Students Missed Out 
On LGBA Conference 

Le~bi ,Jn, gay, bisexual and tran~gender leader, 
from around the United Slate). gathered la~t week for 
the "lIomo exua lity and Public Life" conference in 
the Price Cenler Theater. 

Only a few UCSD ,lUdenl, altended the confer-
ence. In facI , the majority of ,tudent allcndcc~ were 

~omehow affi li awd with the cvcnt ~r>0n~()r~. 
Speaker~ included San Diego City Council mem-

ber Christine Kehoe, As~emblywoman Sheila Kuehl 
(D-Lus Angele~) and Kerry Lobel, executive director 
of the National Gay and Leshian Ta~k Force. 

Given the magnitude.! of the.! event, it i., !ootrange.! thaI 
!ootudents would choo,e not to ruh elhow ... wilh \()mc

Students can'l blame.! Iheil lad or altendance on 
poor pUblici ty. Fli er ... for Ihe eve nt were.! first po,ted al 
the ~ t art of the school year; in fact, many are slill up. 
Furthcrmore, the confen.:nce la~ll:d all day - from 
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. No Olll: ha~ nine ~ Irai g ht hour~ 
of classes. 

Considering a llthi ~, one has to wonder if qudents 
chose to not attend the conference simply because 
Ihey are uncomfoltable with the topic or homosexu-
ality. If so, they missed out on a greal eve n!. 

Biology Department Should 
Have Sought Student Input 

In a effort to reduce the already overwhelming 
number of students pursuing biology majors at 
UCSD, the biology department and the Committee 
on Educational Policy has e.!s labli shed eli gibility cri -
teria for declaring any of the si x biology majors. 

The requirements will include an overall GPA of a 
2.75 in several lower-division prerequi sites and will 
only affect entering studcnl s in fall 1998. 

The decision is a fair one, and is in the students' 
best interests. Creating eligi bility requirements will 
eliminate those would-be biol ogy majors who would 
likely fall behind. It will also force those st udents 
who truly desire a biology degree to work harder, 
increasing student quality. 

Elimination or these less-moti vated studenls will 
creatc a fl allering reput ati on for thi s university and 
the already excellent biology depal1menl. 

Still, more sludents should have been involved in 
Ihe hiology department's deci li ion . Isslics such as 
major requirements need 10 be evaluated by those who 
arc afreeted 1ll0~t - the.! students. We at Ihe Guardial/ 
hope lhat morc care i~ taken in the future to include

WHY UC REGENT WARD 
CONNERLY Is AN IDIOT 

COMMENTARY: Connerly, the political right's most vociferous proponent of 
Proposition 209, asserts a contradictory and inherently flawed argument 

G RAe E 
JAN G 

Against The Grain 

Aside from being Pete Wilson's 
minslre l puppet and an ohseq uious 
peo n of ultra-conservative white 
Republi cans, UC Regenl Ward 
Connerly IS nai ve, foolish to Ihe point 
of embarrassmenl and blind. 

In adopting the most reactionary 
position of the right , and reve ling in 
the back-slaps of rig hi -wing eXllelll-
ists and the laudarory speeches of 
ot her head-up-I he-ass buffoons like 
Newt Gingrieh. Connerly has whee-
dled hl\ y"ay InlO conservatl ve whIte 
America as ils tol-.en hlacl-. man. 

All of hi~ hfe. he has strm:d to he 
an '"American" h)' hiS oy, n righl and, 
as hI.' said In an inlerllCw Wllh "60 
Mlnutcs" Oil SUIl .. 0\.9, his own life 
is a tcslll110nlal that anyone can "rnakc 
it," If only he rulls him\el f up b) Ihe 
boolstraps. 

Connerly "made il" as the only pcr-
\l1Il of co lor In an all-while fralernity 
and. lalcl , as the studenl bod) prcsl -
(Icnl of a college in which he wa, OIlC 
01 only a few bla.:ks at Ihe school. 

How was Ihis possible. especially 
during Ihe 1960s? Accord ing to 
Connerly. who, de~plle dire poverty 
(he ale a sl iee of ~weel potato for 
hreakfast. walked several miles from 
school to have another slice of sweet 
potato for lunch, and for dinner -
guess whal he had - another slice of 
sweel potato), struggled to sUl:ceed 
and , "made it" because he pulled him-
self up by the bootstraps. 

To this, one of Connerly's cousins 
replied, 'That is a lie!" She told "60 
Minutes" thai, growing up, Connerly 

Connerly Is a victim of 
his own lies. He 
denies that he is a 
member of any group; 
he is merely an 
"American." He claims 
that affirmative 
action delegitimizes 
the "individual." His 
logic is wrought with 
bad faith. 
was a bo) who had "a loal of hrcad 
under cach ann" and hdd "a lway, 
wanted to he whllc." 

She ~ays Ihat he could not have 
"madc it"' without hclp from thc 
African-American comillunity, which 
he tails to acknowledge a~ hi s own 
(Co nllerl y ~ hun s the Icrm "Afric.m 
American" because he has " never 
been 10 Africa" and "docs not plan 10 
go there"). 

Okay, so now we know that 
Connerly is not only a sy~ophant, but 
a liar, as well. I suppose that this 
should be expeeted from someone 
who claims his "mentor" is Pete 
Wilson. To do this, you've gOlto be a 

liar - a li ar good enough to convince 
yourself that Wil son is capah le of 
"mentoring" anyt hing more than hi s 
oppressed-white-male syndrome. 

Connerly is a victim of his own 
li es. He denies thut he is a memher of 
any gro up; he is merely an 
"American." 

"American" - the tenn is a loaded 
one. To many hopeful immigrants, the 
word is a catch phrase for all that is 
ideal : work hard enough and you can 
have that "American dream," com plete 
with middle-c lass status, college-edu-
cated children and a white-picket fence. 

Impl ici l in thi s vision is the nOlion 
of the individua l: you , yourself, mu st 
strivc 10 ohtain that job, the pay raise, 
the huu,e on a hill - and once you 
have It all. chalk il up to "just de~scrt~." 
You had failh in Ihe Amcrican concepl 
of "rugged individualbm"; hence. you 
were hallll\omcly n:warded.

never separate from that of the group, 
as a group is comprised of individual

claims that affirmative action is "un-

LIBERALS HAVE A POINT •••••••••••••••••••••• • the • 
• • Editor: 

Well , il looks like "The 
Libera ls" have gone and offended 
Chris Schreiber again hy continu-
ing to protest the implementation 
of Proposi li on 209 (" Equality 
Redefined in Ihe Wake of 
Proposi tion 209," Nov. 13, 1997). 
When will Ihe~e liberals realize 
Ihat if you believe something is 
wrong. you should just sil back and 
accept it? 

If Schreiher thinks Ihal withoul 
affirmative ac lion programs, a sys-
lem of opportunity ha~ed on indi-
vidual meril exists in thi s country 
or on this campus. he should really 
get out more. If such a system 
exists (i ndeed, he implies 
Caucasi.m people are often at a dis-
advanlage), 1 would he inlerested in 
knowing his explanation for the 
lack of women and minorilies in 
almost all posilions of aUlhority in 
Ihe public and private seClor~ . 

Schreiber's commenlary i\ well-
timed - I was just contemplating 
how, in my four years as a polili cal 
science major at UCSD, I have had 
only white male professors. If I fol-
low Schreiber's logic, Ihey must 
have been pretty lucky to beal OUI 
all the olher applica nls who would 
have been hired jU~1 because Ihey 
were women or minorilies.

I wa, always a lillie ,uspicious 
of Dr. King and hi~ "colorblind" 
speeeh unlill realized he was aClu-
ally arguing for fewcr opportunities 
for Illinorilie~ in the United Stales. 
I've since posted Ihal speech on my 
refrigeralor 10 remind me nol to 
treat anybody better jusl because of 
the eolor of their skin. 

Nobody can GCCli e Ille of 
racism - I don ' l even acknow l-
edge thai race exists! Of eourse, I 
wi II conllnue to be afraid of young 
blaek men in elevators. but thal 's 
just being sensible . 

Now. I am sure you've heard 
Ihose pesky liberal naysayers and 
Iheir whiny diatribes about "diver-
si ty." They want u~ to helieve thai 
if we go to a universi lY where the 
,tudent body is overwhelmingly 
white, thi s might nOI prepare us for 
a world Ihal is increasingly cultur-
ally and racially diverse. 

Don' l Ihey undersland. though, 
that with Ihe death of afli rmati ve 
aclion, many white graduates will 
li ve In communities 100 expensive 
for minority non-graduates ') We 
won' t ever have 10 worry ahoul 
diver~ity, hccau~e all the di versity 
will be living on the other side of 

town I Prob lem solved. 
Besides. I' m gelling Sick and 

tired of hearing that race has any-
thing to do with cultural di versity. 
These liberal ninnies assume Ihal 
jusl because somehody grew up in 
an African American or Hi spanic 
family. they might have ~ome valu-
able insights to share wilh our uni-
versi ty colll lTlunilY. 

However. I know just a!> much 
about bei ng hlack as somebody 
who has had black skin a ll their 
life. I mean, I watch Vibe. IlistClllO 
rap music . The time has eome 10 
forget till about people's raee and 
SlOp prclending people arc "pe-
cial" or "valuable" just because 
Ihey bave a differe nt "pcrspeetive." 

I f Illy SAT score is higher Ihan 
their!>, th at means quilc simply thai 
I'ln a better person. and therefore 
more worthy of a co llege degree. 
Period. Besides, if we let morc 
minority sludents inlo Ihe UC ~ys­
lem , Ihere might nol be enough 
white stu dents left to voice our own 
cultural viewpoi nt. I'm nOI Willi ng 
to take Ihal risk. 

T he on ly question Icn is. whal 
can we do 10 get minorities to MOp 
comp laining? Well, li bera ls have 
Ihe nOlion Ihat if we can't use afli r-
Illalive aClioll. we at least need 10 
belle r prepare minorilY students for 
adlnission .~ to Uc. [ couldn 'l agree 
more. That's why I support school 
vouchers - so poor ~Iudent s can 
afford 10 go 10 all the wonderfu l 
private ,chools availahle in Ihe 
inner cily. 

Why. I'll bet the privale schools 
would be Ihrilled 10 admil thou-
sands of poor mi norilY siudents and 
leac h them how to talk like regular 
members of soeiety. Mayhe we can 
finally gel these minonly people 10 
"integrale" and starl aCling more 
like U~I 

A ll in al l, I'm satisfied that now 
we have tI university syslcm where 
admission is based solely on Ihe 
unassailahle property of merit -
and somelimes athletic abi lity -
and occasional I y whether you r par-
enls were alumni . BUI definitely 
nOI raee.

Amf'rlCorps Getting Things Done 

INDIVIDUAL: 
Everyone is part of a 
vast social network 
ContInued from pa,. 4 
"un-American" because it ecl ipses 
the "individual." 

Yet, Connerl y's own rank as UC 
regent would have been impossible 
to allain, had it not been for hi s 
socia l network of the white boys' 
club, with Wilson at the head. I 
highly doubt Connerly did it "a ll on 
his own." 

Ironically, he now (ab)uses hi s 
position as UC regent, whieh he 
gained via group social network-
ing, to advocate "individual" 
accomplishment. 

Opponents of affirmative action 
yell, "un-American" at using group 
membership for "special prefer-
ences" ur "reverse discrimination." 

Yet, a closer look at those who 
hold the executive positions in this 
nation (i .e. the U.S. presidenl , 
CEOs, members of Congress) will 
reveal that all Americans hold fast 
and true to the belief that to gel to 
the righl places, you need to have 
the right connections. 

A multitude of factors will grant 
preferential treatment - coming 
from the "ri ght" family, belonging 
to all the "right" clubs, sororities 
and frat erniti es, allending the 
"right" church, go ing to the " ri ght" 
,chool. After all, " It 's not what you 
know, hut who you know."

heen contingent upon a va~t socia l 
network ; no one can excel in 
school (or anywhere else) without a 
SUppOI1 system compri sed of fami -
ly. friends, caring professors and 
advisors . 

Whether we like it or not , our 
se lf-image and fee lings of self-
worth are largely deri ved from our 
com munication and interaction 
wi th others. 

There i~ a certain intellectual 
vacunusness in the concept of the 
individual as a pure entit y. 

Thursday, November 20, 1997 

Proponents of individualism claim 
that it is possible to succeed on 
your own, without help. 

Tu quote one of the greatest pro-
f es~ors I ha ve ever had , 
"Individualism is wishful thinking 
that doe~ enormous damage, but it 

succeed~ because it plays up to 
people's un~tated se lfish moti ves. 
There is an intellectual dishonesty 
about believing otherwise." 

II can no longer be denied: each 
of w, is a member of at least one 
group. Our mode of belonging in 
the group could diller - whether it 
is that of ambivalence, love or hate 
loward the group, we are members, 
simply because humans are social 
creatures. 

Affirmalive action follows Ihat 
logic and provides Ihe social nel-
work necessary 10 help members 
perform on a level playing field . 

Why am I, an Asian (againsl 
whom affirmative aClion supposed-
ly discriminates), advocating affir-
mative aClion after Proposition 209 
has passed? 

Because I am a woman of color 
who has experienced discrimina-
tion, bolh covert and overt; because 
the story of one ethnic minority is 
linked to that of another; because 
equal opportunity without affirma-
tive action is impossible; because 
there are no blacks at our medical 
sehoul; because the number of 
Latinos, African Americans and 
Native Americans applying to col-
leges is disparagingly low and 
because the number oj students of 
co lor being accepted IS even lower. 

Most Importantly, because I r we 
all 0 I'. thl: laws to contJllue to cater 
to the likes o j Wilson and Uncle 
Tom Cunnerly, we will rever! to dl' 
jac/() seglega ti on. 

One word comes to mind when 
I ,ee COJ1nerly bluffing about how 
he is proof that affirmati ve action is 
"unnece,~ary and unconstitutional" 
- idiot. 

Actually, scratch Ihat : Connerly 
i~ beller described as a "stupiditari -
an," which, according to the Oxford 
EIlRlis11 Dictionary, is "one whose 
ruling principle is stupidity, l which 
isl the condition of being deprived 
of the usc of faculties ." 

In fact, if you look carefully 
under the word "stupiditarian," you 
will see a pi cture of Conneriy cal-
ing a sli ce of sweet potato.

way to deal with any disciplinary 
matters that may arise in the IFC. 

Sigma Alpha Epsilon prc\ident 
Allen Kleinman said last night that 
the fraternilY has voluntari Iy cho-
sen 10 withdraw from the [FC for 
the next two quarlers due to the 
seriousness of Ihe situation. 

"Because some of the members 
violated the ideals of our fraternity, 
we have placed sanctions on them," 
Kleinman said. "The fraternity has 
also decided to remove itself from 
the [FC. 

"It's a necessary consequence. 
It 's tough but fair," Kleinman con-
tinued. "These acts of aggression 
hurt the Greek system." 

In addition to the complaints 
filed with the [FC, the Panhellenic 
Association held an emergency 
president's council meeting 
Monday evening. At this meeting, 
the members unanimously 
approved a resolution staling that 
the association and the sororities 
within it would no longer "conduct 
any event or activity wilh the Della 
Sigma Phi fratemity or the Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon fraternity." 

The resolution was adopled 
because the fralernilies ' behavior is 
"not refleclive of the value~ and 
ethics of fratcrnitl e, nor the Greek 
system as a whole." 

The resolution will be in effect 
through the 1997-1998 school year. 
In fall 1998. the Panhell eni c

Lecture Held About Islam and Science 
EVENT: Sal amah 
works for the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory 
By Paul Dodge 
Staff Writer 

Without the efforl, of Muslim 
scienti sts and philosophers, many 
of the sciences and arls would 
have been lost in the stagnation 
Ihat swepl over Europe in the Dark 
Ages. 

This message was the focus of 
Dr. Ahmed Salamah's talk on 
Tuesday, prescnted during the sec-
ond day of the Muslim Student 
Association's (MSA) Islam 
Awareness Week, entitled "Islam 
and Science." 

"The truth is the truth." 
Sal amah said. "The experimental 
approach to science and the scien· 
tific method are Muslim inven-
tions." 

Salamah works at NASA's Jel 
Propulsion Laboratory located at 
the California Instilute of 
Technology. 

Salamah received a Ph.D. III 
astronomy and aerospace engi-

neering lrom Ihe Uni vcrsity of 
Texas In Au,tin. Hc is currently 
involved in the Mar~ Pathfinder 
mission and was .the 1997 reciri· 
ent of ASA's highl:, 1 honor. the 
Except ional Service Medal. In 
addition. Sal amah teaches part-
time al various institulions. 
Presently he teaches aSlronomy nt 
Santa Monica College. 

With this background in astron-
omy and an interest in Ihe history 
of science, Salamah explored the 
contributions of Muslim science to 
the pool of world knowledge. 

"Muslim science dominated 
the entire world during the 800 
years we call the Dark Ages," 
Salamah said. 'The truth is that 
this' period was only dark from a 
Western perspective. On the other 
side of the Mediterranean was a 
nourishing and advanced civiliza-
tion." 

Outlining a few of Muslim sci-
entists' contribulions, Salamah 
stressed that many of these contri· 
butions were akin to Newton's 
work in mechanics - yet they 
receive little or no recognition or 
credit in today 's textbooks.

Salamah also said that had it 
not been for these works in sci· 
cn.:e by Muslims, European 
renaissance scientists wou Id have 
had little to work with . 

"When European science broke 
from Catholicism and awoke from 
its long sleep, all they had were 
the Latin texts translated from 
Muslim works," Salamah said . 
'The Muslims kept the sciences of 
astronomy and navigation, to 
name a few, alive while Europe 
was dark." 

All of this, Salamah said. can 
be attributed to the nature and 
message of the Qur'an, or the 
writings Muslims believe 
Muhammad received as his reve-
lation from God. Salamah believes

"There JrC more Ihan 900 \ers· 
es in the Qur'an and mo~t urge 
man 10 study and learn, to know 
about the Earth," Salamah said. 
"Some even talk about scientific 
facts . The message is that the 
Earth was gi ven to man for his 
constant study." 

Sal amah said that Muslim sci-
entists received the impetus for 
their work and discoveries from 
this message. He believes that the 
Qur'an is crucial to understanding 
the relationship between Muslims 
and science. 

"One cannot understand 
Muslim science without under-
standing its gravitation around 
the Qur'an," Salamah said. "II

development of true science, of 
science as an effort. It stoppcd

it was with the Greeks, and it

"People of color are operating 
from an experiential background, a 
knowledge about I white people]," 
Elliott said. "Whites are operating 
out of lotal ignorance." 

EllioH ~aid whites in America 
are hung up on race. 

"While folks in this counlry 
have an obses~ ion of co lor," she 
said. "White people ha ve deliber-
ately introduced racism based on 
.. kin color in thi~ counlry." 

According to Elliott , there arc 
many different ~hades of skin 
color in the world. However, she 

reject~ thi~ physical trait as a way 
to c la s~ify people. 

'l'hcre an: 2,500 skin colors on 
thl' earth ," said Elhotl. "Bu l there 

i~ only one race, it's ca lled the 
human race. 

"Get over the Idea of four or 
fi ve or six races, there is no such 
thing," she added. 

Elliott said ~he is disturbed 
by the fact Ihal America's pris-
ons are mainly occupied by 
African Americans. Pri soners 
work for 22 cents an hour, doing 
everything from making 
McDo nalds ' uniforms to lele-
marketing, wilhout any so rt of 
benefits . 

"We arc re-institutionaliling 
slavery in this country, and if you 
don't know it, you're probably 
white," Elliott said . "When 
politicians start talking about 
building more prisons, they know 
who they arc gomg to put in 
them ."

Elliott said that due to the con- said she found Elliott's direct 
stant oppression people of color 
face, they have learned to adapt. 
She said whites, unaware of this 
problem, don ' t have to deal with 
it.

about race.

"White people

"You were not

there Is no gene 
for racism or

are all things 
that you have to 
be carefully,

Anything you

time to reject 
that 

lem with respect 
to racism and 
diversity." 

Go said she 
was disturbed that 
more staff and 
faculty members 
than students 
attended the pre-
sentation. 

" I was very 
disappointed that 
more siudents did-

"The students are

values are as 
important as 
politicians make them sound . 

A~cording to Elliott, men 
rarely collect more than Ii ve years 
of Social Security paymenls. She 
also said that most women live the 
last 20 years of their life without 
male companionship. 

"We only believe in family val-
ues as long as women are of the 
childbearing and child-rearing 
years," she said.

Elliott concluded by telling the 
audience that racism isn't an 
innate quality, bUI ralher some-
thing constructed by society. 

"You were not born a racist; 
there is no gene for racism or sex-
ism," Elliott said. 'l'hose are all 
things that you have to be careful-
ly, carefully taught. 

"Anything you learn, you can

Catch the space-rock stylings of 
Laika. who will perform with 
Fiona Apple at the EI Rey Theatre 
in Los Angeles on Dec. 12. 

In this interview, Laika master-
minds Fixsen and Fielder discussed 
their broad gamut of influences, as 
well as the overa ll density and 
accessibility of their complex style.

comes out sounding more passion-
heavy. 
Does it sound more on the 
rock .ide than the elecbon-
ic side? 

Fiedler: It 's altogether differ-
ent. 

Fixsen: I think it's just runky. 
We' re nol so much into rock music 
or dance musi<.: Ihat we do one or 
the other. We just like both of them, 
so, hopefully, il comes across as the 
besl ofbolh worlds. Thai 's the idea. 
anyway. 
Are you working on any 
new material? 

Fixsen: Yeah, we've got a rew

Clean and clear doesn't alway~ get 
you a good sounding record . 
How do you convert your 
material into a live perfor-
mance? How does your 
audience react to the live 
performance? 

Fixsen: It doesn ' t sound radi-
cally dirferent. It 's mo .t1 y just that 
we're limited be!:ause there arc 
only Ii ve people to play, and I

There wcre lrach rrom our fir~t

kits on thcm , and umpteen

I guess a <.:ertai n amount of simpli-
fi<.:ution goes on, or rocusing, 
depending on how you look at it. 

Margaret plays a lot more guitar

01 works out because it 's more of a

Guardian: This movie is 
essentially about a complex

Merton's exact relationship 
with the two respective 
female characters? 

Roache: Well, \I.'lth Kale Croy

earnestly in love. and he's desper· 
ately desiring 10 hed her. She\

Because thi ... character 1\ facmg her

Did you gain any insights

during the making of the 
movie and through playing 
Merton? 

What I liked ahout the film is 
that it i~ was more like all inve~t1 -
galion into the fl~ydllJlugy of sexu-
al p",sion and not just romantic 
love, and it looks at the darker SIde 
01 hoth . 

Merton is a rather weak and 
,unhivalent man in many ways. und 
hl!\ not a t} pical hero In any sense 
of the word. It really helped me 
understand how easi ly you can lose 
control and get caught up in so me-
thing higger than yourself. 

Also, thi s fi lm clearly shows 
how people in relationships aren't 
always prepared to he very honest 
and ~.traig ht·forward . 
As this film was based on 
Henry James' novel, did you 
read it to prepare for your 
role? 

I deCIded not to. I made that 
choice hecause the director and 
scrcenwnter had already cu lled out 
the essence of the story from the 
hook and they actually changed it 
qUlle dramatically. I knew that if I 
went hack to the original, [ would 
cOllstantly say "What about this 
scene, how abou t this hi t." and I 
would just comp licate matters. 
Then how exactly did you 
prepare for the role? 

I did some research Int o the

~".....-

*** 

Space Monkeys is an interesting 
concept from a foursome who 
appear to have as cocky an altitude 
as another British rock hand -
Oasis. Not surprisingly, the quartet 
sounds a lot like them. Add two 
parts Republica, a teaspoon of 
Chemical Brothers and a dash of 
Prodigy, and you've got Space 
Monkeys - a smooth, yet tired 
blend of Brit-pop/acid house. 

Much of The Daddy of Them All 
is weighed down by boring guitar 
ballads, which are quite ordinary 
despitc the drum 'n bass back-
ground. "Dear Dhinus" and "Wc 
Are the Supercool" fall into thi s 
category. The whiny voca l~ of lead 
singer Ri chard McNevin don' t 
help much, ei ther. 

The alhum is sa lvaged by such 
tracks • .- "A\;id House Killed R(x:k

San Diego's local jazz scene 
leaves a lot to be desired when 
compared to more favorable scenes 
for discriminating music fan, such 
as that of Chicago. 

Chicago's newest success comes 
in the form of the avant-jazz outfit 
Isotope 217 which recently released 
The Unstable Molecule. This does 
not come as a surprise, as the city's 
musical roots are in black music and 
avant-jazz scenes which spawned 
The Art Ensemble of Chicago.

features two members of instrumen-

San Diego's sweethearts, Three-
Mile Pilot, take a tum for the lighler 
on their lalest full-length effort, 
AM/her Desert ArIOlher Sea. The 
band, which has reached the upper 
crust of local indie-rock talent, is also 
one of the most underrated holes-in-
the-wall in the music industry, as seen 
in their departure from major label 
Geffen Records to the locally based 
Headhunter Records/Cargo Music. 

Nevertheless, Three-Mile Pilot 's 
new release is notably well-produced 
(Steve Fisk, Mark Trombino), as well 
as stylistically and instrumentally 
stringent. The only significant 
change from their last full -length 
masterpiece, The Chief Assassin TO 
lire Sin iSler, is the new alhum's chop-

After Dr. Dre departed from 
Death Row Records, he needed an 
act to put on his new label, 
Aftermath Records. The first 
release, The Aflermatli , did not 
deliver. Dr. Dre no longer needs to 
worry, though; The Firm - The 
Album single-handedly propelled 
Aftermath Records to success. 

The Firm - The Album repre-
sents the ultimate in collaborations, 
teaming producers Dr. Dre and The 
Trackmasters with artists Nas, AZ, 
Foxy Brown and Nature. The result 
is a hip-hop masterpiece, one 
which needs to be heard to be 
beli eved.

Well-known hip-hop producer 
Timbaland makes the transition to 
being an artist with Welcome To Ollr 
World, in collaboration with label-
mate Magoo. 

The result is a gem from begin-
ning to end, providing nothing but 
Timbaland's signature sound - olf-
ti med drum patterns and syncopated 
beats that will make even the most 
passive listeners nod their heads. 

Because of limbaland's extraor-
dinary production talent, each track 
has its own unique vibe. In the 
remix of "Up Jumps Da Boogie," 
the original track is transformed into 
a party joint with up-tempo bass 
lines and keyboard rills. He applies 
thi s ~ame formula to the remi x of 
"Luv 2 Luv U," aga in Iilking one o/' 
his ~ong~ and turning it into some-
thing to keep dance fl oors jumping. 

Unlike some producers today, 
Timbaland keeps away from the 
overused sample, loop-heavy style. 
Timhaland also has a certain sensl: 
of lyrical ,ki ll , blend ing catchy and

~el: 21 and over 
Drlnkl: $2 for mosr, a few nightly specials 

Br~ Ccnl ,,-,- ... ~ 
In most regards, thi s is one of 

the finest clubs around. It is targel-
cd at a college age crowd, most of 
whom are already nosta lgic for the 
' 80s music scene. DJ Bryan Pollard 
rolls out great stuff /'rolll Prince, 
Soft Cell, Madonna. Peter Murphy, 
Duran Duran, the Smith~, and all 
the other great '80s bands we all 
know and love. 

The space is great too; several 
pool tahles. plenty of litt le ~tation~ at 
which to si t and drink, a hardwood 
dance Iloor, and a copious amount 
of lights, sparkly things, and fog 
machines. There i~ al~o a heautlful 
s hruhbery-elH: lo~ed patio whl:re 
swingers (;un dance to '80s rockabil -
Iy all night. 

The only problem i, allcndancc. 
For .,ome reason - be It bad pub-
licity, the fact it\ on tI Wednesday. 
or what have you - very few peo-
ple all end, making the amhience a 
lot less club-like. 

The current retro-'80s Sl:L:ne i~ 
close ly linked to the goth-i ndustrial 
scene, and Clu b '!Ws provides a 
forum ('or th i~ strange f1lixture ; it i~ 
the onl y place I've been where you 
can ,ec a bunch 01' black-clad goths 
dancing to Madonna. 

However. the constituency 0(' 
the club is not entire ly married to 
the dark side. Many people go in 
their everyday clothes, with their 
everyday attitudes, si mply to enjoy 
a lillie sli ce of their childhood 
served up in retro dressing. So have 
no fear if you don't have any black 
vinyl or burgundy ve lvet in the 
closet at home: you wou ld still rind 
a happy home at Club ·80s.

that I per~onally don ' t rea lly like

hecause Club '80s isn't Mnctly a 
goth club, or maybe it has wme-
thing to do wi th the fact that its 21 
and up (sorry kids, but the tmth 01 
the mailer is that all -ages clubs arc 
usually kind of depressing). 

Drinks are cheap, but the bar-
tender doesn ' t really know what 
he's doing and he', sort of surly. 
All in all , this place is prctly cool: 
mellow, relaxed, and prelty friend-
ly. Of course, I had a few drinks 
before leaving the house, so may be 
I' m not too objective.

Opening act Death In Vegas set 
the stage admirahly by finding 
their groove midway through their 
set. Such tracks as "Glitters Is 
Gold" and the radio-friendly 
"Dirt" highlighted the band's 45 
minutes on-stage. By utilizing a 
more psychedelic and mellow take 
on electronic music, the quartet 
warmed up the house just enough 
to awaken its se nses.

of period films and is known as

UCSD Sports Clubs Round-Up 
LACROSSE 

UCSD beat UCLA Ihi s past weekend . No, 
ii 's not a mi sprint. Our campus is now home 
10 a group of men who handed it to the 
mighty Bruins. The culprit? The Ii ghlin ' 
Triton men ' ~ lacrosse leam. 

Thi s past weekend, 
Ihe leam trave led to 
Loyo la MarYlllount 
University 10 play in 
Ihe Jesuit Classic 
Tournament. 

UCSD, perhaps 
intimidated by Ihe 

Bruins, found itself down 3-1 carlyon in the 
contest. Led by Frank Lemes' three goals, 
UCSD stormed back to close the gap to 5-4. 

From there, senior middie Demetrius 
Chapin-Rienzo took over. He scored two 
goals as UCSD completed the upset, 6-5 . 

The rest of the tournament saw contribu-
tions from Dan Cohan and Evan Old ford just 
fall short in Ihe men's match with rival USD. 

In its final game of the tournament, UCSD 
lost to WCLL powerhouse Arizona, 7-1. 

Despite the two los es the accomplish-
ment of the men .should not be overlooked. 
Hey, they beat UCLA.

ULTIMATE DISC 
Ultimate Disc: Call it whal you will. but 

don't call it fri sbee. The UCSD Air Squids 
arc an ultimate di sc team wilh something to 
prove. Last weekend al the Warren West lield, 
UCSD hosled Southern California schools 

such as UCLA, 
USC, UC Santa 
Barbara and 
Redlands in a war 
for ultimate-disc 
supremacy. 

For the tourna-
menl, UCSD divid-

ed its squad into three teams, two of which 
made it all the way to the semifinals. In the 
first semifinal. UCSD I knocked off the two-
time National Champion UCSB Black Tide, 
relying on the inspired play of Ben Finkelor, 
Jon Watkinson and Mark Humphrey. 

In the second semifinal, UCSD 2 lost to 
UC Davis 13-11. despite greal efforts by Paul 
Davis, Kevin Lenaburg and Matt Ritter. 

The finals pitted UCSD I against the 
underdog UC Davis team who had lost to 
UCSD I earlier in the tournament. This time, 
however, Davis prevailed over UCSD with a 
surprising 13-10 upset.

ICE HOCKEY 
For those who mighl nOI have noti ced. 

there isn' t a whole lot of icc in San Diego. 
You can ' t just step outside, laee up your 
shoes and go for a skate. Yet, against all odds, 
UCSD has a men's hockey team - a good 

one al thaI. 
This pasl week-

end the leam head-
ed north in search 
of ice and victo-
ries. On Saturday, 
the team found 
both, posting a 9-3 

thumping of San Jose State University. 
Justin Mi liard opened the scoring, convert-

ing on a shorthanded breakaway goal. After 
SJSU came back to take a 2-1 lead, Jason 
Barglow hammered a puck left unattended in 
the crease 10 tie the score. Captain Lawrence 
Chan followed up Barglow's effort with a 
wrist shot that found its way by the SJSU 
goalie's legs, staking UCSD to a 3-2 lead. 

The start of the third period saw UCSD 
increase its lead to two goals, as Noby 
Itakura put home a power play opportunity. 
UCSD pulled ahead for good when Bhavin 
Mehta and Craig Brown added goals.

AilS divisions will finish their seasons in grand fashion tomorrow 
night on the stadium field at NCR. It will be the first time all 5 games 
will take place under the lights. There will be plenty of parking and

should offer the most entenaining night of football in UCSD history. 

Men's AAA • 7pm • COBRA vs GANG GREEN 
It's rare that the top seeds make it to the finals, but these two squads have been number one-

two all year. Ne"her has a loss and Gang Green wasn't scored upon in their first two playoff games. 
COBRA has concentrated their recruiting on the UCSD track team picking up sprinters and high-
Jumpers that can go get any of quanerback Derek Bennett's wobbly ducks. GANG GREEN fea-
tures Anthony Funicello and Dave Ham in their devastating ground game. COBRA has been in the 
finals the last 2 years and the 'pressure' of championship football shouldn't effect them. They do 
have a tendency to let their mouths and attitudes give up too many yards. If GANG GREEN will 
stay patient and let COBRA se~ deslruct, they shoukJ be in it 'till the last drive.

Is this finally the year Kerey Chong will get his blue ribbon? BTS has been one of the very best 

teams in flag football for years, but they've always choked In the playoffs. They appear to be on a 
misSion this time. They have a huge playbook thai always keeps delenses reeling. Then they back 
it up with arguably the lastest defense in 1M's. The HUSKERS won't be rolling over! They are 8·q 
currently and their defense has only given up 6 points in 3 playoff games. On offense they are led 
by the quick feet of Shayne Ferber who led 1M's in rushing this past season. They can also go deep 
to Brian Picket just to keep things honest. Will BTS be gagging, choking and puking all over NCR 
again?

Wrth their win over the number one seed, BIG RICHARDS established themselves as the team 

to beat. They have been killing everyone running up an average of 26 points per game in the 
playolls. Right now, they would probably go 0-T with The Chargers. On the other side of the ball 
IS the Cinderella story. PARAPLEGIC TURTLES has been the beneficiary of an easy draw through 
the championship bracket. Their largest margin of victory was a 12·6 win in the semi·finals. This 
one looks really one-sided. The TURTLES have no chancel (Pin that up in the locker room)

Coed AA • 6pm • WASHED UP HAS 8EENS VI CHARLIES ANGELS 
The WASHED UP HAS BEENS have owned this division for the past 2 years. They are the 

two·time defending champions and last year represented UCSO in New Orleans at the Nike Na-
tional Tournament. They are led by Shelly Squibb who is one of the top talents in flag football and 
she alone should keep them in this game. But, the dynasty appears to be over. Advancing age and 
personnel changes have brought this team down to earth. They limped into the playoffs with a 3-2 
record and barely won a 26·25 playoff opener. CHARLIES ANGELS beat the HAS BEENS back in 
October, 18·7. They have a great group of ladies that carry the team, led by 1M Superstar Jen Lew . 
The guys don't measure up, but they are cleverly hidden. Jen accounted for almost 75% of the 
ANGELS total offensive output.

of TRACTION and he's out of town w"h the Women's Soccer team. In his absence the rest 9f the 
oId·timers will try to piece together a staning lineup. All you need to know about RANDI T is Carrie 
Ellis and Elizabeth Bedell. Speed, hands, moves, Ihey have it all. They have caused fits in defen-
sive backfields all year. RANDI T has won their two playoff games by a total of 2 points. This one

When a Second 
Turns to a Lifetime 

It 's as if tllne \ tops. A once-
dormant arena comes to life, its 
newly- arrived Inhabitants fill -
ing the rafter~ wllh the hopes 
and dream~ or their friends, 
cla~smates and loved ones. The 
standing ovation steadily roars 
to a deafening climax , creating a 
buzz of exci tement and energy 
that flows from the hleachers 
down to courtslde. 

And there, on the hardwood 
1100r, ~tand the ath letes. Students 

fir~t, but athlet e~ at heart , they 
stand together as a team. Sweaty 
palms and thumping heartbeats 
take over. In the midst of ner-
vousness and a rush of adrena-

"'ne, brain and matter merge to 
provide maximum control or 
arms and limh~. All that remains 
is a desire - a desire to com-
pete, to battle, to win. 

Substitute court with field , 
field with pool, or pool with 
track - the emotions remain the 
same. Whether it be a women 's 
or a men's squad, a Division lor 
Division III match, at home or 
away, the pres~ure is the same. 

Seconds turn into minutes; 
the crowd's noise lulls to a 
whisper and life comes to a halt . 

The pivotal play itself lasts 
for a mere two seconds. The ball 
skips away from her hands, 
landing barely out of reach as 
her teammates dive to save their 

( season. The desperate attempts 
. are too late, however, as their 
hopes land harmless ly on the 
1100r. Game, set, match. 

Euphoric winners stand on 
one side. Shocked losers on the 
other: Both reached this destina-
tion with one goa l in mind. 
Endless ni ghts practicing and 
countless day~ training were the 
norm. Only one team's road 
stretches on. however, while the 
other must wait for the next year. 

A~ the team\ leave the 110or, 
cheers of appreciati on cascade 
down form the stand~. Showing 
its gratitude. the crowd's 
acknowledgment I~ a~ louu for 
the losers as the winner~.

played out In a ncar-empty 
arena. Cheers .lIe n:placeu with 
apathy, pride replaced with 
angel and life replaced with 
emptiness.

HOME COURT: UCSD will host the 
University of Wisconsin-Whitewater 
thi s Saturday in NCAA Quarterfinals 
By Steve Walsh 
Sentor Staff Writer 

All right, Triton sports fan , it's time to see what you 
are really made of. This Saturday night, the UCSD 
women's volleyba ll team plays its biggest game of the 

year as they host the 
NCAA Quarterfinals. 
That's ri ght, I said host, as 
in the match will be played 
here at UCSD. That means 
it's time to see everyone 
out in full force to support 
the team. 

For those of you who 
are not aware of it, the 
opportunity for UCSD to 

host a match so late in the playoffs is very rare and very 
big for the Triton competitors as well as for the school 
itself. 

Despite being a team that is consistently rankeu 
among the nalion's elite, the Tritons have previously 
been sli ghted from the honor of hosting because the 
majority of Division III schools are east of the 
Mississi ppi . This means that UCSD is usually one of the 
first schools to have to pack its traveling bags; not thi s 
year, though. 

"We haven't hosted a match this late in the playoffs 
in years, so we're hoping for a big turnout," junior mid-
dle hlocker Shannon Noonan said. "We love playing in 
fronl of a big crowd. Cheering is such a big part of the 
game, and the crowd rea lly gives us momentum." 

As the No.3 ranked team in the nation, the Tritons 
have dominated so far this year. Using a powerful com-
bination of veteran experience and youthful enthusiasm, 
UCS D compi led a record of 24-5, including an unde-
feated 17-0 aga inst Division III opponents . 

More impressively, Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland's squad is currently on a record 20-match 
winning streak. 

In the Quarterfinab. the Tritons will welcome the 
University of Wisconsin-Whitewater to La Jolla. These 
two teams squared off earfi er in the season in the Trinity 
(Texas) Tournament wi th UCSD taking the victory. 

The Tritons know, though, that a win in the regular 
season means nothmg when it comes to playoff time. 

"This is going to be a more competit ive game then 
we 've seen thi s year," oonan said . "We really want to 
go 10 the Final Four. 0 one on the team has gone to one 
yet. Last year',; senIOrs went when they were freshmen. 
but we haven 't had our chance." 

This year, the Tritons have exemplified the (rue deli-
