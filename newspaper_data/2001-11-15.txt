UCSD tests 
Bay Bridge 
supports 
Bay Area span to 
be rebuilt stronger 
By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writer 

UCSD structural engineers on 
Tuesday conducted seismic testing 
on a concrete- and steel-reinforced 
pier that models those planned to 
support the new east span of the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge. 

The tests, which began last 
week, were conducted at the 
Charles Lee Powell Laboratories at 
UCSD to determine the overall 
strength 3nd earthquake resistance 
of the newly designed bridge 
columns. 

The project is headed by UCSD 
Jacobs School of Engineering 
structural engineering chairman 
and professor Frieder Seible. 

Testing continued Wednesday 
morning when a quarter-scale 
model of the structural column was 
put under enough pressure to theo-
retically cause the tested column to 
fail. 

"Failure occurs when a bridge 
can no longer carry any additional 
seismic load," Seible said.

A.S. OKs diversity commissioner 
Position awaits college councils' go-ahead 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council voted to 
amend its constitution and estab-
lish a new elected position, the 
commissioner of diversity affairs, . 
in an open roll-call vote last week. 

Three of the five college coun-
cils must now approve the legisla-
tion before the constitution is 
amended. A.S. President Jeff 
Dodge and A.S. Vice President 
Internal Jenn Brown will present 
the proposal to the college coun-
cils beginning Nov. 15. 

H adopted by three college 

councils, the new commissioner 
will report to the A.S. Council on 
the state of diversity affairs at 
UCSD. Responsibilities of the 
position also include providing 
support to diversity-related orga-
nizations, polling UCSD students 
to assess concerns regarding 
diversity on campus, and appoint-
ing representatives to committees 
pertaining to issues of diversity. 

The proposal was authored by 
Dodge, Brown and A.S. Vice 
President External Dylan de 
Kervor. 

The commissioner of diversity 
affairs will be the sixth commis-

This would be the first new

said A.S. Secretary Anna Mason. 

De Kervor said that the Unity

UC Regents to vote on 
admissions overhaul 
Atkinson endorses the proposal 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Committee on 
Educational Policy of the UC 
Board of Regents voted 
Wednesday 13-2 to adopt a com- . 
prehensive review process in 
undergraduate admissions sys-
temwide, sending the proposal to 
a vote by the entire UC Board of 
Regents. 

Comprehensive review would 
replace the old system of admis-
sions, and require campuses to cre-
ate a new system that takes into 
account factors other than just test 
cores and grade point averages for 

all applicants . 
The entire board, consisting of 

26 regents, will vote Thursday on 
whether to adopt the policy. If 
passed, the cha~ge will be in effect 
for Fall 2002 applicants. 

T he Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools, which 
developed the proposal, defines 
omprehensivc review as "the 

process by which srudems applying 
lO UC campuses arc evaluated for 
admission ming multiple measures 
of achievement and promi c while 
considering the comext in which 
each student has demonstrated 
academic achi evement." 

The Assembly of the Acadcmic 
Senate, a UC-wide body consisting 
of faculry and staff from the ninc 
campu es, adopted the proposal b} 
B.O .A. R.S. unanimously In 
October. 

If passed by the regents, the 
proposal will eliminate the cri teria

Not shopping: Felia Cortes, with help from UCSD students, protests at UTe 
against what Students for Economic Justice calls unfair labor practices. 

SEJ protests at UTe 
Group claims six janitors fired unfairly 
By KIRmN HUBBARD 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD students congregated at 
the University Towne Centre shop-
ping mall in La Jolla Tuesday to 
rally against what they call unfair 
labor practices by Westfield 
America Inc., which owns 40 shop-
ping centers nationwide. 

The protesters, primarily mem-
bers of campus group Students for 
Economic Justice, claimed that 
Building One Services Corp., a 
major West Coast cleaning con-
tractor used by Westfield America, 
unjustly fired six janitors from 
Horton Plaza and one from 
Fashion Valley. Protesters said that 
the janitors were fired witllOut 

notice, and that the fired worker 
were trying to attain better wages 
and benefits by organizing a union. 

"I 'm doing this because I feel it's 
the least I can do," said Roosevelt 
sophomore Lucia Moritz, one of 
about 20 students who protested. 

Westfield America acquired the 
UTC mall in 1998, and renamed it 
Westfield Shoppingtown UTe. 
Westfield America owns 20 shop-
ping cemers in California, eight of 
which are in the San Diego area. 

The protesters said that 
We tfield America should not have 
hired BaS, and that UTC should 
hire the workers who were fired 
from the other locations.

Great American Smokeout hocks cold turkey 

The Student Health Association, as part of the 
American Cancer Society's 25th Annual Great 
American Smokeout, is sponsoring information, 
games, resources and support Nov. 15 in the Price 
Center for people t!'{ing to quit smoking. 

Several local businesses are also joining the 
fight to help smokers quit. The Brigantine 
Restaurant Corp. is offering smokers a cold turkey 
sandwich and a coupon fo r a free appetizer in 
exchange for a pack of cigarettes and a pledge not 
to smoke for the day. The offer is good at Brigantine 
Seafood Restaurants in Del Mar and Point Loma 
and at Azul La Jolla. 

LifeScore, a San Diego health care company that 
uses electron beam scanning to detect life-altering 
or life-threatening diseases, will donate $50 to the 
American Heart Association for each scan it per-
forms on patients who mention the Smokeout pro-
motion throughout November. Patients will also 
receive a 5 percent discount on their scan. 

UCLA scientists link 
genes, brain structure 

The first images that show how people's genes 
influence their bra in structure and intelligence have 
been created by UCLA brain·mapping researchers. 

The findin~s demonstrate how parents pass on 
personality traits and cognitive abilities. Tight struc-
tural similarities in the brains of family members also 
explain why brain diseases such as schizophrenia 
and certain forms of dementia run in families. 

The team found that the size of the frontal lobe 
of the brain is determined by the genetic make-up 
of an individual's parents and strongly correlates 
with that individual's cognitive ability, as measured 
by intelligence test scores. 

The scientists used magnetic resonance imaging 
technology 10 scan a group of 20 identical twins and 
20 same-sex frate rnal twins. The research, which 
was corroborated by the National Public Health 
Institute of Finland and two Finnish universities, 
showed which parts of the brain are determined by 
genes and which parts are environmentally adapt-
able to factors such as leaming and stress. 

The UCLA scientists were led by Paul Thompson, 
assistant professor of neurology at the UCLA 
Laboratory of Neuro Imdging. 

UK will use software 
developed by SDSC 

The San Diego Supercomputer Center Storage 
Resource Broker, a scientific data-management tool. 
is now peing distributed to the United Kingdom's 
academic community and will become a key part of . 
the UK data grid. 

The SRB software is designed to efficiently man-
age vast amounts of raw data tha~ in modem com-
puter-driven scientific research projects, is transmit-
ted to and from many locations for processing on 
many computers. The SRB indudes p<l'Nerful meta-
data capabilities, support for security, and flexible 
access control for sharing data. It is distributed via 
CD-ROM. 

According to SDSC researcher Arcot Rajasekar, 
the use of the SRB in the UK Grid Starter Kit is the 
clearest indicator that the SRB is now an interna-
tional production tool and no longer just a research 
prototype. . 

Because of the size and scope of the UK grid -
it currently consists of more than 10 sites - the 
Central Laboratory of the Research Councils for the 
UK has established an e-Science Centre to offer

A.S. researches Triton 
Taxi expansion to TJ 

. , 

Two locations eyed for pickups 
By SHARON SHAPIRO 
Staff Writer 

Representatives from the A.S. 
Services and Enterprises staff and 
the UCSD Student Safety 
Awareness Program took a field 
trip to the U.S.-Mexican border 
last week to evaluate a possible 
expansion of the Triton Taxi pro-
gram to include one-way service 
from the border. 

The group visited both sides of 
the border to assess surroundings 
on a typical Friday evening and to 
~etermine possible piclcup loca-
tions for Triton Taxi. 

Two proposals have been slated 
as a result of the trip. Both models 
propose expanding to include se.r-
vice from the border on 
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday 
nights that would allow UCSD 
students a free and safe ride home, 
according to Colin Parent, A.S. 
commissioner of services and 
enterprises. 

"We're trying to guarantee a 
safe way.for students to get home if 
their planned ride falls through or 
they find themselves in an unsafe or 
uncomfortable situation," Parent 
said. 

The first (nodel proposed would 
include pickup from the Old Town 
Transit Center. 

The second model, which is 
preferred by the A.S. Services and 
Enterprises staff, would include a 
more direct pickup location. 
Students would be able to walk to 
the Jack in the Box restaurant on 
East San Ysidro Boulevard, where 
they could usc.public phones to call 

Triton Taxi and wait inside for the 
van to arrive. 

Jack in the Box is preferred 
because it is open 24 hours a day, 
well-lighted and near officers on 
patrol, Parent said. 

Parent said the program would 
not encourage underage drinking, 
because the proposal only allows a' 
one-way ride, thus discouraging 
students from relying exclusively 
on the service. 

"Part of the reason we struc-
tured the program the way we did 
is to make sure that intelligent 
people realize that it's not a pro-
gram that encourages underage 
drinking, but rather a program 
that promotes student safety," 
Parent sa id. 

Student Safety Awareness 
Program Director Nancy Wahlig 
said that Triton Taxi has prevented 
possible dangers to students. 

"It is an added protection; an 
option for someone left at a party, 
for example," Wahlig said. 

Parent said he hopes the pro-
posal will be completed by early 
winter quarter, when it will be pre-
sented to the A.S. Council budget 
committee. If passed, the proposal 
would go into effect the following 
Friday night. 

Last year, the A.S. Council 
spent close to $10,000 providing 
the Triton Taxi service. Parent 
estimates that the Tijuana expan-
sion would double the budget for 
Triton Taxi . 

Triton Taxi service is now 
available Fridays and Saturdays 
from II p.m. to 3 a.m. Its piclcup 
number is (858) 505-4991.

WCSC adopts diversity resolution 
Language includes affirmation of First Amendment 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Warren College Student 
Council unanimously approved 
a resolution regarding the 
UCSD Principles of 
Community, campus diversity 
and free speech during its Nov. 
8 meeting. 

Discussion that led to the reso-
lution began at the Oct. 18 
WCSC meeting, sparked by 
actions of The I<DiIIII, a student 

Test: 
Bridge columns bui~ to 
SUMVe large earthquakes 
Continued from pale 1 

Engineers and transportation 
officials are attempting to control 
such failure on actual bridges dur-
ing an earthquake. 

The pressure applied to the 
test structure - 700,000 pounds 
of seismic force - was four times 
as great as would occur in an 8.0 
earth qua Ice. 

According to Brian Maroney, 
principal bridge engineer of the 
Cal trans Bay Bridge East Span 
Project, the tests were conducted 
to gauge the level of deformation a 
bridge would endure in the event 
of a major earthquake. 

"There is a 70 percent chance 
in the next 30 years that a large 
earthquake may happen," 
Maroney said. 

Seismologists have determined 
that the location of the east span 
of the Bay Bridge - on the San 
Andreas and Hayward faults -

publication that the council saw as 
discrimina tory. 

Warren senators, however, 
said that the need for the resolu-
tion existed prior to the discus-
sion. 

"Ignorance exists at and 
beyond UCSD," said Junior 
Senator Lauren Lee. "We should 
be striving every day as a counci l 
and campus to reaffirm our com-
mitment to education and aware-
ness on issues of all forms of diver-
sity." 

makes it extremely vulnerable to 
heavy earthquake damage. 

"Damage zones" are built into 
the new structural design to 
ensure that specific, easily fi xed 
parts of the bridge will absorb the 
force of an earthquake, protecting 
the rest of the bridge from life-
threatening and fi nancially disas-
trous damage. 

The current east span of the 
Bay Bridge, completed in 1936, 
suffered serious damage when 50 
feet of the upper deck collapsed in 
the 1989 Lorna Prieta earthquake. 

The destructive quake prompt-
ed state legislators to fund the 
retrofitting of standing bridges, 
such as the San Diego-Coronado 
Bridge, and replacement of bridges 
deemed too seismically unsound to 
repair, such as the eastern span of 
the Bay Bridge. Cal trans will 
retrofit the western span of the Bay 
Bridge that links Verba Buena 
Island and San Francisco. 

Although airplanes have inad-
vertently flown into the Bay 
Bridge and caused no serious 
damage, the new piers are also 
built to withstand damage from 

WCSC Sophomore Senator 
Kevin Hsu helped write the reso-
lution. 

"Discriminatio n, prejudice 
and hate exist on our campus, 
even when they are not visible," 
Hsu said. "Only by taking action 
ourse lves to better appreciate 
dive rsity and confront hate can 
we hope to establish our campus 
as a pl ace of respect and under-
standing."

aircraft. 
If an airplane fl ew into the 

newly designed eastern Bay 
Bridge, "it would be too bad for 
the planc," Sieble said. 

Building a new eastern span of 
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge Skyway with seismica lly 
sound columns will cost about $2.6 
billion, a figure considered more 
economical than tile cost of retro-
fitting the present-day structure. 

UCS D has highly advanced 
tcsting laboratories, making it a 
prime location for seismic testing. 

"ruCSD] has one of the most 
impressive facilities in the United 
States," said Maroney. "Cal trans is 
competing agai nst time after 
Loma Prie ta, and UCSD has 
demonstrated they are willing to 
race with us." 

Hundreds of geologists, geo-
technical engineers and structural 
designers are involved in design-
ing and testi ng the new bridge and 
its components. If test results are 
satisfactory, the Bay Bridge 
Skyway construction is scheduled 
to begin in early 2002 and end in 
ea rly 2005 .

UC raise proposal 
will only benefit a 
select minority 

At a time when UC officials have 
repeatedly made references to a tight bud-
get, the UC system is looking to give its 
executive vice chancellors and engineering 
deans raises of as much as 25 percent -
this while faculty and staff can expect rais-
es on ly in the range of 0.5 to 2 percent. 
The UC Board of Regents will con ider 
the management ra i e during its 
T hursday meeting at the Laurel Heights 
campus of UC Sa n Francisco. 

While the GlIrn-dirl1l acknowledges that 
paying top officials is a good business 
practice, the intrinsic inequi ty in the pro-
posed plan will cause more harm than 
good. 

UC spokesman Paul Schwartz has 
tried to justi fy the move by stating that 
the salaries the UC system pays its senior 
managers have fa llen behind what other 
univer ities offe r. He said that "preserv-
ing top-ca liber lea dership, especially 
during these extremely challenging eco-
nomic times, is critical to maintaining 
UC' competitiveness and institutional 
quali ty." 

This is a noble goal set forth by the UC 
system. It would keep the salaries of the 
system's top people competitive with those 
of other universities, enabling the system 
to attract the top talent and preserve the 
quali ty that people have come to expect 
from the University of California. 

The problem with the proposal is that the 
large discrepancy between what the top 
chancellors would be given and what the 
professors would be given is inexcusable. It 
has the distinct possibility of creating a lot of 
disgrunded professors. While it is the seruor 
management that ultimately is responsible 
for the overall quality of the UC system, it is 
the professors who are in constant contact 
with the students. They educate the stu-
dents and are direcdy responsible for the 
qual,ity of educa tion that UC students 
receIve. 

We feel that even a 2 percent increase of 
professors' salaries - the most optimistic 
for professors under the new proposal -
would simply not be enough in light of the 
25 percent increase that the executive vice 
chancellors and engineering deans would 
receive. According to the proposal , only 
one- th ird of UC professors would get the 
2 percent raise. T he remainder would only 

~)e getti ng a 0.5 percent cost-of-living 
Increase . 

With so much bei ng made of economic 
hardship of late, we simply cannot support 
a move like this by the University of 
California. 

If money is tight, then we urge the UC 
system to not spend what money it does 
have on large raises for its top brass while 
leaving professors - the ones directly 
responsible for our education - with 
small ra ises that are scarcely above normal 
cost-of-living increases. 

We urge the UC Board of Regents to 
reject this proposal. We acknowledge 
the good in tentions of the proposal but 
cite it blatant inequa lity as well as the 
current times of economic hardship as 
reasons enough not to enact such large 
raises for the senior manager of the UC 
system.

I BET THE NEXT ONE

W'fO summit goal: putting 
people ahead of profits 

Industrialized nations have the opportunity to 
save countless lives in developing countries 

By DIVYA RUNCHAL 
Opinion Editor 

While many members of the interna-
tional community are focused on the lat-
est developments in Afghanistan, another 
region in the Middle East is host to an 
issue that could have an immense impact 
on much of the world. 

At stake are perhaps thousands oflives 
that will no doubt be affected by a recent 
agreement reached at the World Trade 
Organization summit in Daha, Qatar. 
Although negotiations were tense, a res-
olution was reached between developing 
nations such as Brazil and India as well as 
industrialized ones such as the United 
States on the matter of easing restrictions 
on patented drugs. Unfortunately, it is 
unclear how successful implementation 
of this plan will be. 

For many years, critics have alleged 
that weallhier nations have put profit 
above human life by opposing plans for 
developing nations to find alternatives to 
expensive dnlgs that the majority of their 
citizens cannot afford. Both Brazil and 
India , suffering from the social and eco-
nomic burdens of millions of citizens 
infected with malaria and AIDS, have 
sought to import or make generic drugs 
that could be widely distributed in their 
countri es. Yet they have consistently been 
stonewalled by the massive efforts of the 
pharmaceu tical indusuy and the United 
States, both of which oppose their plans. 

Thousands o f lives could have been 
saved - or at the very least prolonged -
in the process. 

One has to wonder why an indusuy 
garnering about $ 300 billio n a year is 
worried about the potential effects 
generic drugs would have on the market. 
On Nov. 8, CNN reported on its Web 
site that the "provision of cut-price med-
ici nes in poorer countries will hardly put 
a dent on the ... indusuy." Yet the phar-
maceutical industry still fears that future 
research will be jeopardized by "over-rid-
ing patents." It is clear that this 
immensely powerful industry is worried 

more about the potential loss of profits 
than the well-being of citi;,.ens of so-
caUed "third world" countries. 

Unfonunately, the United States has 
been one of the most effective and vocal 
opponents of the fight to suppress devel-
oping nations' claims to easier access to 
life-saving drugs. In the past, the United 
States has consistently charged that 
Brazil and India's desire for a waiver to a 
rule that "guarantee[sl 20-year patents 
on medicines" will threaten the pharma-
ceutical industry. 

; It is our responsibility to 
ensure that everyone has 

access to life-saving drugs 
and it is morally 

irresponsible for us to 
ignore the fact that millions 

of lives depend on 
unrestricted access to 

effective medical 
treatments. We have 

demonstrated our military 
prowess in the Middle East-

let's hope we can 
demonstrate our prudence 

and our compassion. 
At the same time, however, the 

United States' hypocrisy on this issue has 
been exposed . On Nov. 8 CNN noted in 
its Web site that the United States, after 
a series of anthrax scares following the 
terrorist attacks in New York and 
Washington, D .C. , "threatened to use 
generic versions of the patented drug" 
Cipro because Cipro is so expensive. 
Although anthrax is a serious and poten-
tially life-threatening illness, it is dwarfed 
by the horrific effects of being infected 
with malaria or AIDS - especially when 
many in a poor nation simply cannot 

afford potentially life-saving medical 
treatment. It is unethical for the United 
States to criticize other nations who are 
clearly acting in the best interests of their 
citizenry when it is unable ~o follow the 
same rules that it forces upon others. 

Although the agreement reached by 
both sides in Qatar leaves many opti-
mistic about the future of public health in 
developing nations, it is hoped that a 
quick and effective enforcement of the 
resolution will be enacted. Yet it may not 
be wise to be optimistic about the agree-
ment just yet. While CNN reported on 
its Web site Tuesday that the "deal is 
believed to give developing nations more 
flexibility in over-riding patent rules on 
public health grounds," delegates have 
not yet released the details of the plan 
and it is too early for any of them to 
know if it is completely feasible . 

Further complicating matters is the 
apparent reluctance of industria lized 
nations to enforce the deal. Shockingly, 
the United States delegation has stated 
that "the final text should be considered a 
political statement rather than a lega lly 
enforceable document." This is obvious-
ly distressing because it implies that not 
much wiII actually change. However, as 
noted before, it is simply too early to tell 
whether the plan will work effectively or 
not. It is hoped that this agreement will 
effectively set the stage for better rela-
tions between rich and Poor nations and 
dispel the idea that wealthier nations care 
little for their poorer counterparts. 

Today, the United States has a unique 
opportunity to demonstrate to tlle world 
that lives are .nore important than the 
profit margins of corporations. 

It is our responsibility to ensure that 
everyone has access to life-saving drugs 
and it is morally irresponsible for u to 
ignore the millions of lives that depend 
on unrestricted access to effective med-
ical treatments. 

We have demonstrated our military 
prowess in the Middle East - let's hope 
we can demonstrate our prudence and 
our compassion in the rest of the world.

Patriotism is not exclu-
sive to Americans 
Editor: 

I am writing to you regarding 
the aFticle by Simone Santini about 
flag symbolism ("Flag symbolism is 
complex," Nov. 5). In all honesty, 
this article did not deserve to be 
printed in the GUIlT/Jim, and it is an 
embarassment to you and your 
staff. 

Santini's naive notion that 
national symbolism and pride are 
entire ly American phenomena is 
unjust, untrue and offensive. He 
suggests that France (where 
Napolean's tomb lists all of his 
battles but Waterloo, and Charles 
DeGaulle is regarded IS the man 
responsible for winnin, World 
War Il) is merely IOmethin, that 

"happened to the French people." 
After visiting France, it was more 
than obvious to me that the 
French people are rightly proud of 
France, and have no problems let-
ting you know. 

The very idea that the French, 
Italians, Danes or Spaniards don't 
"feel the need to let anybody know" 
that they are proud of their nation 
is ludicrous. F lags were not invent-
ed by the Americans. In Europe, 
heraldry and flag-waving have been 
around for more than 10,000 years. 
Wearing, displaying and saluting 
the flag are not things that 
Americans thought up; they are tra-
ditions deeply rooted in European 
cultures. 

Most odious of the transgres-
sions committed by Santini is the 
thought - the idea - that we have 
not chosen to be Americans. 

No one forces you to be an 
American. You have the choice to 
leave this country and go else-
where. Some people do. Evidently, 
he does not understand this right. 
All of us here - every adult in 
America - have chosen to stay 
here, and be an American. Santini's 
conclusion is simply too obscene to 
warrant a response. 

The sloppy writing, obvious 
lack of research, blinding elitism 
and skewed logic of this article 
make me ashamed to be a UCSD 
student. This is the kind of dreg I 
would expect to find on an 
obscure Internet message board, 
not ina respected universi ty 
newspaper. 

I urge you to print your opin-
ions - publish the controversial 
issues - but please, do not allow an 
embarassment such as this to soil 
your pages again. If you recieve a 
submission like this from one of 
your writers again, please foward it 
to TIH KMItI, where it belongs.

War is not an effec-
tive, just solution 
Editor: 

As a Marine Corps Gulf War vet-
eran for peace and social justice, I 
have first-hand experience with the 
U .S. war machine. I joined the 
Marines as a young man with the 
desire to defend democracy. Instead, 
I was used to defend a dictatorship in 
the Middle East against another dic-
tatorship in that region, all in the 
interest of corporate oil. That one-
sided war against the people of £raq 
continues to this day in the fonn of 
wee.k1y bombings and brutal eco-
nomic sanctions that have claimed 
the lives of at least a million pCople. 

A National Public Radio report 
estimates that approximately 50,000 
innocent children in rnq are starv-
ing to death each year in direct 
response to our sanctions there. 
These bombings and sanctions must 
end immediately, but I am writing to 
express my view on something even 
more urgent. The United States of 
Americas current war on the people 
of Mghanistan must come to a halt 
immediately. Many innocents have 
died as a result of U.S. bombings. 
Others have lost their homes and 
livelihood as a direct result of the 
bombings. 

The United Nations and many 
humanitarian agencies have called 
upon the United States to at least 
halt the bombing so that food and 
aid may reach some of the refugees. 
This aid stopped because of the 
bombing and rlJis aid is the only 
hope for these people. According to 
all these agencies, if the bombing 
does not stop immediately, hun-
dreds of thousands - perhaps mil-
lions - will die of starvation this 
winter. We are facing the grim real-
ity of genocide being perpetrated 
by the U.S. government. 

As citizens or workers in this 
nation it is our responsibility to do 

THOMAS JEFFERSON 
SCHOOL OF LAw 

--

everything we can to stop this war. If 
we do not stop this war, we too are 
culpable in perpetuating genocide. 
The present war is ethically repre-
hensible, morally repugnant, cate-
gorically indefensible and absolutely 
unjustified. Even if one lives by some 
barbaric code or law of vengeance 
based upon mutual slaughter of 
innocents, the war has run its course: 
The score is more than settled. 

This, interestingly enough, is 
one of the only arguments I have 
heard in favor of the war besides 
the infantile diatribe of the, " they 
started it" variety or the intell ectu-
ally stunting, "we have no choice." 
The international terrori st crimes 
of Sept. 11 are inexcusable, but we 
may never know who the criminals 
responsible for the atrocities are. 

H we do know who is responsi-
ble, the proper course is to bring 
them to justice in an international 
court. Slaughter of innocents , 
genocide by starvation and destruc-
tion of nations will not make us 
safer from future terrorist attacks. 

In fact, chances are the current 
policy is having quite the opposite 
effect. Write to your senators and 
representative and to the White 
House, sign a petition and participate 
in a demonstration. Above all, edu-
cate yourself and organize! 

Start by reading the principles 
of nonviolence and social justi ce 
taught and expressed so eloquently 
by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. W ar 
is over (if we want it)!

u.s. must not budge on 
policy toward terrorists 

Editor: 
Mathew Lepori's article ("A 

Stable Secure Palestine is the Key 

7~?~ 

OPINION 5 

to Peace," Nov. 8) is not only igno-
rant and misleading but utter ly 
offensive. Following the worst ter-
rorist attack in history in wh ich 
almost 5,000 Americans were killed 
- while the country is still mourn-
ing and most of the bodies have not 
been recovered - an American 
student finds it necessary to follow 
tlle propaganda line o f the killers . 

T he U .S. government has 
found a link between the perpetra-
tors of the murderous atrocity and 
Osama bin Laden's terrorist orga-
nization in Afghanistan. As a result, 
American soldiers at this very 
moment are risking their lives to 
root out the terro rists and replace 
th e funda mentalist regime~ that 
protected them. 

Yet as far as Lepori is con-
cerned, U.S. policy is completely 
wrong. According to him, it is not 
about el iminating the killers and 
their supporters. As fa r as he is con-
cerned, "the importance of fi nding 
Osma bin Laden pales in compari-
son to build ing a stable and secure 
Palestine." How come? 

T he worst thing that the United 
Sta tes can do is to indicate tll lhe 
terrorists that it is willing to change 
its policy - any policy, anywhere 
- because of their threats, killings 
and lies. Are we to start taking cuc~ 
from the killers in the cavcs) I ~ the 
Arab Street dictating Amenca n 
policy? Is the United Swc'> going 
to StOP supporting the only demuc-
racy in the M iddle Em at the 
request of a madman and his sup-
porters? 

Whoever th inks tha t the tcr-
rori sts will be content with a 
change o f po licy and that 
"Palestin e is the key to peace" did 
not get the message o f Sept. 11 . It 
is not about policy. We were and

6 OPINION THE UCSO GUARDIAN 

Letters: 
Palestinians have erod-
ed efforts for peace 
Continued from pale 5 
ual expression. As such we are the 
enemy of any religious extremists. 
It isn't about America's actions as 
much as America's nature. Even if 
America would alter its nature 
and start to follow its enemies' 
line of logic it will not appease 
them. To the contrary it will 
strengthen their wiII to demand 
even more. 

And what was so wrong, Mr. 
Lepori, about the "way the United 
States government handled its rela-
tions in the [Middle East)?" . For 
years the United States has sup-
ported the Oslo Accords. The 
United States has facilitated nego-
tiations on the final status agree-
ment. 

President Clinton stood behind 
a generous offer proposed to the 
Palestinians in Camp David 2. The 
Palestinians rejected the <;ompro-
mise and instead started an armed 
rebellion. 

During this, countless acts of 
terrorism were committed against 
Israel by organizations operating 
from within the Palestinian terri-

tories. 
This is part of a long war that 

Israel has been fighting. Our war 
against terrorism might be a long 
one as well. This conflict will be 
fought not only with bombs and 
clandestine operations but wi th 
words and ideas. Information can 
be used as a weapon and history 
will be a strategic asset or a liabili-
ty. We cannot afford to be ignorant 
and naive about what we are facing 
and who the real enemy is. 

An independent and safe 
Palestinian state is one solution to 
the current conflict. However, as 
President Bush said in his -speech to 
the United Nations on Nov. 10, 
"We must unite in opposing all ter-
rorists, not just some of them. Any 
government that rejects this princi-
ple, trying to pick and choose its 
terrorists friends, will know the 
consequences ... 

Only after the Palestinians 
clearly demonstrate that they 
understand this principle should 
they get the support of the United 
Nations, the United States or stu-
dents at UCSD. 

Mr. Lepori, isn't the current 
effort about trying to eliminate ter-
rorist states, not create them?

"We felt that it is important to 
have some sort of institutionalized 
voice for those communities who 
don't feel like their interests are 
being represented by the leadership 
on this campus," de Kervor said. 

Dodge said that many offices 
within the A.S. Council already 
have programs devoted to pro-
moting diversity, and that the new 
office of commissioner of diversity 
affairs would manage such pro-
grams.

Continued from pale 3 

In addition to affirming First 
Amendment rights to freedom of 
speech and the press, the resolu-
tion implements a structured 
plan for. upholding the UCSD 
Principles of Community, and 
for increasing education and 
appreciation for diversity in all 
forms. 

The resolution adds a line item 
within the WCSC budget for 
diversity-related programs. It also 
requires increased educational 
programming at Warren college, 
regular self-education presenta-
tions during council meetings, and 
a diversity training session for the 
council directed by an expert on 
the subject. 

Also included is mandatory 
outreach to a high school with 

fragmented approach to diversity 
issues," Dodge said. "This idea 
comes from wanting to centralize 
the action so that we can actively 
create change and progress, and 
increase our diversity. It's going to 
prioritize diversity as a council 
concern." 

If the proposal passes the col-
lege councils, the A.S. Council will 
accept applications for the position 
and the A.S. president will appoint 
someone to serve until elections in 
the spring. Dodge said the new 
commissioner will not be appoint-
ed until winter quarter. 

The proposal passed with a 
vote of 19-0-1. One senator 
abstained. 

The commissioner of diversity 
affairs will support and assist pro-
grams like the Student Affirmative 
Action Coalition, the Lesbian Gay 

large populations of groups 
underrepresented at UCSD. 

The resolution called for the 
creation of committees to exam-
ine diversity appreciation and 
hate at Warren college, and to 
oversee enactment of all the 
action items. 

Hsu said the decision to write 
the resolution - although initial-
ly sparked by the KotI'" controver-
sy - was ultimately made on the 
basis of a desire for diversity and 
awareness within Warren college 
and the greater UCSD communi-
ty. 

MOur view was that we had to 
address our own situation before 
we could start improving other 
organizations on campus," Hsu 
said. 

Co-author Doug Hanes said 
the original plans were to write a 
resolution against Tht KoII"' . 
However, Hanes said, the council 
decided that what was really need-
ed was "a resolution that had teeth 
in it."

De Kervor said the new posi-
tion is not the whole solution to 
UCSD's lack of diversity. 

"It's not enough, but it's a step 
forward," she said. 

The A.S. Council opened the 
vote on another constitutional 
amendment Wednesday night. 
This one, if passed, will establish a 
seventh commissioner: the com-
missioner of athletics. Senators 
must submit their votes by Friday. 
If passed by the council, this legis-
lation will be taken to the college 
councils at the same time as the 
commissioner of diversity affairs 
legislation. 

"We wanted something that 
didn't just deal with Tbe.KMIII, but 
something that we could carry 
out," Hanes said. "We felt that the 
best way to combat hate was to 
educate ourselves as a council, and 
we decided to take a proactive role 
[with this resolution)." 

Lee said many of the commit-
tees outlined in the resolution 
have already formed.

at least one committee, and all of 
the committees are meeting this 
week to develop a plan of action 
so that all of them will be up and 
running by next quarter," Lee 
said. 

Lee added that it was impor-
tant that the resolution include 
action beyond the resolution 
itself. 

"We wanted to set forth actual 
goals that were attainable, that we 
knew we could do," she said. "I 
was very pleased with the final 
product because I knew that we'd 
be able to do it."

"Everyone should be guaran-

The band of protesters burst 
through the doors of the urc

female worker. The group then 
marched through UTC, followed 
closely by television cameras, pho-

Protesters assembled around

not designed to change the ethnic 
diversity of campuses," Brown sa id. 

The 2001 -2 002 state budget 
alloca ted $750,000 for the imple-
menra tion of com prehensive review 
at the UC campuses. T he new poli -
cy wi ll see some cost increases, 
including wages for an increased 
number of application readers. 

At UCSD specifica lly, the new 

admissions procedure will be a 
three-phase process, replacing the 
old two-tier method, according to 
Brown. 

A large difference will be in what 
is considered in the first tier, Brown 
said. In the current system, the first 
50 percent of students are admitted 
solely on academic criteria, such as 
GPA and test scores. In the new sys-
tem, Brown said additional factors 
will be considered initiall y. 

"We're adding fami ly income, 
first-generation college, and stu-
dents who are identified as attending 
schools that don't send many stu-
dents to UCs and CSUs," she said. 

About one-third of the students 
will be admitted under this plan, 
Brown sa id. T he remaining stu-
dents will go t11rough an extensive 
"comprehensive review."

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15,2001 
De Kervor led a postcard cam-

paign, asking the regents to 
approve comprehensive review. 
Over 400 postcards signed by stu-
dents were taken by a Graduate 
Student Association representative 
to the Nov. 14 and Nov. 15 regents 
meetings. 

Brown said that UCSD facul ty 
emphasized in meetings over the 
summer that academic factors still 
be heavi ly weighted in the new 
admissions po licy. 

"We're still looki ng for students 
who achieve," Brown sa id . 
"Academic achievement is a critical 
component of the old and the new 
admissions policies. The primary 
goal of comprehensive review is to 
admit the rype of studen ts to 
UCSD who wi ll do well at 
UCSD."

Best Mall: 
Fashion Valley 
140 Fashion Valley 
San Diego 
(619) 297-6440 

For some poor souls -
usually of the male persua-
sion - the act of purchasing 
wares is viewed as a labori-
ous task, and is performed in 
the same dispirited manner 
that would accompany any 
act of drudgery. However, 
for the more enlightenld, 
searching for various elusive 
items remains a never end-
ing quest to be dutifully per-
formed with the same pas-
sion and fervor as any other 
ritualistic act - and almost 
always occurs at malls. 

Complete with an array of 
stores designed to satisfy the 
most fantastic need or whim, 
this modem-day bazaar is not 
only the pwveyor of a diverse 

~rtmentof~but~ 
of convenience. 

Within San Diego 
County, Fashion Valley 
Mall, located off Friars 
Road and situated only 15 
minutes from campus, is 
generally held by most to 
offer the best in mall shop-
ping. While not designed to 
cater to a students of ten-
constrained budget, this lux-

urious outdoor mall is a 
shopper's paradise, boasting 
over 140 stores all contained 
within a spacious and aes-
thetically pleasing setting. 

Generally viewed as the 
standard criteria in assess-
ing a mall's worth, upscale 
anchor stores such as 
Nordstrom and Neiman 
Marcus can be found at 
Fashion Valley, along with 
mall requisites Macy's and 
Robinsons-May. Another 
favorable aspect of Fashion 
Valley is that it is largely 
devoid of the usual droves 
of prepubescent rabble that 
infests most malls - thanks 
largely in part to the fact 
that its stores serve a more 
exclusive clientele. 

Where Fashion Valley 
truly succeeds is in its 
diverse assortment of small-
er stores, including Tiffany's, 
which represents the ulti-
mate source of happiness for 
every girl, and Sun Diego, 
an overpriced, mass-marleet-
ed store that no self-respect-
ing surfer or skater would be 
caught dead in. In the end, 
with its pleasant atmos-
phere, wealth of stores and 
prime location, its easy to 
see why Fashion Valley Mall 
is generally held in such high 
esteem within San Diego.

Best Pizza: 
Papa JohnS 
4130 La Jolla Village Dr. 
La Jolla 
(858) 458-9800 

Papa John's has become 
a major staple of UCSD 
student life ever since it 
made itself visible on cam-
pus through coupon books, 
advertising and word of 
mouth. 

With 13 locations in San 
Diego alone - including 
one on Villa La Jolla Drive 
(which is the closest fran-
chise to campus) - Papa 
John's has become a popu-
lar spot for students to find 
sanctuary, or maybe just a 
little pizza. As the cheese 
melts over a delicious, 
trademark thin-crust 
dough, your cares melt 
away with it. And who has 
had butter garlic sauce with 
bread sticks and not felt 
their knees go weak from 
the taste? 

"I think it's just a great 
pizza place to go to off of 
campus," said Roosevelt 
senior Natalie Greenberg. 

And that is why Papa 
John 's is this year's best 
pizza joint: because it is 
just a great place to go 
when one is off campus. 

"I enjoy [the pizza] . 
When it was the cheapest I 
ate it more, but it's still 
good," commented Muir 
sophomore Spencer 
Pforsich. 

One can hang out with 
friends, order whatever 
kind of pizza he'd like and 
relax under the cool light-
ing. And what about pizza 
for delivery? Fast, conve-
nient, efficient and, as 
most the student body 
agrees, "damn good" when 
it arrives. Quality is what 
Papa John's is all about, 
not kowtowing to some 
grand corporation that is 
only concerned with mon-
etary gain like other pizza 
companies. 

Although most students 
look upon Papa John's as 
"good stuff," there are a few 
who have other opinions. 

"I don 't really like Papa 
John's pizza because it 
doesn't seem like rea l 
pizza," said Revelle sopho-
more Caitlin White. 
"Their bread is like card-
board with crap on it. ( 
don't know - it's not very 
good." 

Think what you want 
- Papa John 's was sti ll 
voted a great place to have 
some piz.::! ,

Best Club: 
On Broadway 
615 Broadway 
San Diego 
(619) 231-0011 

Built in 1925 by John D. 
Spreckies, the building at 
615 Broadway is now home 
to San Diego's most 
upscale hot spot - and 
UCSD's best nightclub 
pick! 

On Broadway is without 
a doubt the place for those 
wanting to live it up in 
style. If you are looking for 
a posh evening and are not 
worried about a budget, 
you will certainly find what 
you're looking for at this 
club, which is loca ted on 
the Gaslamp Quarte r's 
northern border. 

Inside On Broadway, a 
fl oor of Italian marbl e 
sparkles under a cei ling 
made of gold . Two 72-inch 
monitors and a stratos-
phere of lights line the 
walls and dance floor, pro-
viding a backdrop of fl ash-
ing color. 

On the first floor alone 
you will find a VIP lounge, 
a 35-foot- long bar and the 
Zen Cafe and Sushi Bar. 
No details have been 
spared in t his posh night-

The building that now 
houses On Broadway once 
housed Bank of America 
and H ome Federal Credit 
Union and sti ll retains its 
daunting vault doors . 
Through the doors, how-
ever, you find a billiards

the classy Gallery Lounge 
decorated by cutting-edge 
artists. 

OJ Mark Thrasher, who 
won the 2000 San Diego

Best CO store: 
Tower Records 
8657 Villa La Jolla Drive, Suite 231 
San Diego 
(858) 452-2566 

I could rant about how Tower Records is 
The Man and how sly and corporate it is. I 
could rant about how we should all support 
our local record stores. And by the way, we 
should. 

But how can you compete with Tower's 
massive selection? Tower Records features 
thousands of CDs ranging from sound tracks 
to jazz to Mozart box sets to The Clash box 
s<:ts. You'll find a small vinyl section and a 
massive collection of all the latest singles. 
Tower Records has a passable electronic 
music section and a solid import section. 

ot to mention hundreds of old CDs that 
have been marked down to bargain-base-
ment rates. And of course, Tower Records 
carries all of the albums that are on the 
charts . 

Nearly half a dozen listening stations 
allow you to li sten to new music and there is 
always ni usic playing in the store courtesy of 

_the employees. 

Best radio station: 
9IX 
4891 Pacific Hwy. 
San Diego 
(619) 291-9191 

When you see the familiar black and yel-
low 91 X bumper sticker on a car, go up to the· 
person, introduce yourself and tell him or her 
that 91X happens to have won as the favorite 
radio station of UCSD. Then politely reach 
in, give them that winner's high-five, con-
gratulating yourself on passing the word that 
XTRA 91.1 FM is the best radio station 
around. 

Well; maybe you shouldn't reach in the 
ca r. but feel free to shout it loud and clear 
that the favorite over the airwaves is the 
alternative rock broadcast that gives us the 
Brand X morning show, Bob Marley at 4:20 
p.m. everyday and a dose of Adam Corolla 
and Dr. Drew on "Loveline" at night. 

If at any time you are asleep for these 
benchmarks of the 91 X day. make an effort to 
stay up and catch one of them. No one needs 
an extra few hours of sleep when he can lis-
ten in on the Brand X rejection line, where 
the 9lX-ers do the dirry work for you. 

Best fast food: 
In-N-Out 
2910 Daman Ave. 
Pacific Beach 
1 (800) 786-1000 

Hidden amongst our fast impersonal mod-
ern lives. there is a tiny memory of the pleas-
ant, familiar past. This pleasant reminder is the 
delicious food found at IN-N-Our burger. 

Founded in 1948 by Harry and Esther 
Snyder. IN-N-OUT burger follows the phi-
losophy. "Give customers the freshest. high-
est qualiry foods you can buy and provide 
them with friendly service in a sparkling clean 
environment." and they will return. And this 
philosophy has proven delightfully successful. 

• By 1993. IN-N-OUT had grown from i~ 
first location in Baldwin Park to 93 locations. 
Despite the chain's enornlOUS growth. it still 
remains family-owned and the main philoso-
phy has not changed. making it a fonnidable 
force in the fast food industry with happy 
employees earning much higher wages than 
at other fast food restaurants and receiving 
better benefits. 

Best SO community: p .. 1r 
1706 Garnet Ave. 
Pacific Beach 
(858) 483-6666 

Grand and Garnet Avenues are the land of 
perpetual traffic, tattoo parlors and hip coffee 
places. You can marlc your body. caffeinate 

It also boasts a large video and music 
video selection. along with a relatively new 
DVD section that grows every week. Tower 
also boasts a huge publication section. which 
includes small local publications. thick and 
glossy photography mags, the latest music 
mags from England - not to mention an 
impressive adult entertainment section. 

There is also a wide selection of high-end 
personal electronics ranging from stereos to 
CD players. 

What else is hidden away at Tower 
Records? A great world music collection fea-
turing hit-makers from around the globe. 
There is also a decent collection of books. 
And if you venture through the "back" 
entrance of Tower Records, you'll find all the 
jazz and classical music you want. 

And in all that clutter at Tower Records, 
there's also a small selection of guitar strings 
somewhere in that cavernous room. 

The Tower Records store. in L3 J olla is 
loca ted in the Ralph's shopping center near 
Sports Ciry and The Good Guys. It is open 
from 9 p.m. to 12 3.m. daily. You can line up 
for new releases on Tuesdays just past mid-
night. You can also order music online from 
bttp://tuwm·~(ords.com.

"91X is really tuned into the lifesryle of

To be "relatable." Schock said that 91X

"We do anything from toy drives to beach

But why is IN-N-Our the absolute best 
fast food joint ever? The food of course! 

Even though there are only about six items 
on the menu (Double-Doubles. hamburgers, 
shakes. fries. etc.), they are the bare essentials. 
Each item is great because of the freshness of 
the food and the qualiry of the products. 

As Marshall sophomore Kevin Keyser said. 
"I like how I always get consistently good 
burgers. I've been to a lot of IN-N-OUTs. 
from Northern Cal to Southern. but no mat-
ter which one I go to they are always good." 

And this consistency can be explained by 
the high qualiry products in their food . The 
patties in their burgers are 100 percent pure 
beef. the fries are made of fresh potatoes cut 
on location. and their shakes are made of 100 
percent pure ice cream. And I'm sure their 
secret sauce plays a big part in the popularity 
of the burgers. 

So if you suddenly have the urge to get 
your hands on a great. big, juicy IN-N-
OUT Double-Double, you can find the 
nearest IN-N-OUTs in Pacific Beach, Mira 
Mesa. San Deigo. Kearny Mesa and Mission 
Valley.

There arc many sports bars to

1996, Seau's has been quite success-

crews alike. Occasionally, you may 
run into some of the stars of the 
Chargers as well. 

The inside is reminiscent of 
Jack Murphy Stadium with a gray-

and always fill ed wi lh lots of peo-
ple and lots of energy. 

Thc atmosphere can be quite 
vibrant during big games with big

from almost any angle. And there 
is, of course, enough food to satis-
fy all tastes. The menu covers your 
standard bar foods like burgers, 
onion rings, wings and fries, but 
then branches out into wood-fired 
pizzas, salmon and lobster ravioli . 
The cigar lounge was recently 
changed into a sushi bar. 

I f you happen to be of the post-
21 variety, the bar is where the 
action is at. There are plenty of 
microbrcws on tap and a slew of 
specialty drinks including 
"Lighming Lemonade." There is a 
grea t selection of domestic brews, 
such as Budweiser and Coors Light, 
and import beers like Fosters, Bass 
and Guinness. Seau's Lightning 
Gold is a specialty beer. 

Seau's is located in Mission 
Valley Center on Interstate 8 
between Highway 163 and

Best date restaurant: 
Forever Fondue 
1295 Prospect St., Ste. 201 
La Jolla 
(858) 551-4509 

Located in picturesque down-
town La Jolla, Forever Fondue is a 
favorite place for an intimate 
evening with that special someone. 
It offers a unique dining experience 
around melted cheese, two-pronged 
forks, and lots and lots of dipping. 

At your table, the mixture of 
your choice of cheeses, liquor and 
flavorings are delicately prepared 
to accompany bread consumption. 
You just stab and dunk a selection 
of seafood, meat and vegetables, 
which take a flavorful bath in hot 
broth. As much of an attraction as 
the main courses is the dessert: 
molten chocolate that dances with 
strawberries and marshmallows. 

"It's just a really fun place to 
eat," says Revelle senior Teny 
Abebian of her experience at 
Forever Fondue. "Everyone gets 

to dunk and try different things. 
It's such a lively place to be at with 
friends. You can find what you like 
and so can every one else, and you . 
have a great time in the process." 

Prices are midrange, so you can 
expect to pay about $ I 0 to $20, 
depending on how much you 
order. Some find the portions a 
little on the small side, but the 
taste is definitely worth it. You 
really get what you pay for. 

This is a great destination for 
couples because the shared dip-
ping quickly promotes con versa- . 
tion and a lively atmosphere. But 
heed the many warnings about 
not eating directly from the fon-
due forles and save yoursel f the 
embarrassment of burning your 
tongue. Come for either the 
whole experience or just for 
dessert, but you're sure to sing 
Forever Fondue's praises and live 
by their slogan: "Dip it, dunk it '" 
do it." 

Reservations are strongly rec-
ommendec!.

'Harry Potter' magically escapes into wonderland 
Film adaptation stays true to J.K. Rawling's novel, uses computer graphics to aid story 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Director Chris Columbus' adaptation of J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the 
Sorcerer's Stone" whooshes into 
theaters tomorrow after months of 
fervent speculation. Viewers are in 
luck: Even the most zealous Potter 
fans will not be disappointed. 

"Sorcerer's Stone" brings the 
first of tile Harty Porrer novels to 
ilie screen. For those who have 
been under a rock for the last three 
years, the books follow the develop-
ment of Porrcr and his schoolmates 
at England's Hogwarts School of 

. 'vVitchcraft and Wizardry, where 
they get iliemselves into pates of 
trouble and adventure. 

I larry arrives for his first year at 
Ilogwarrs, making new friends as 
he finds himself contending witl! 
his archenemy come to life, the 
once-defeated Lord Voldemorr.

Hocus pocus: Harry Potter (Daniel Radcli~e), Ron Weasley (R~bert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) cast a 
spell in 'Harry Potter and Sorceror's Stone, which comes out thiS Friday In theaters. 

Three new faces star as Harry 
and his friends Hermione Granger 
and Ron Weasley, and the trio 
finds support with a cast com-
prised of veteran British actors 
from the theater and cinema. Alan 
Rickman positively drips menace 
as Severus Snape, the children's 
sallow-faced potions professor. 

The film 's particular strong 
point is its liberal use of computer 
animation for special-effects 
sequences. Filming many of the 
book's scenes would have been 
unthinkable with the technology of 
10 years ago. The quidditch match 
sequence halfway through the film 
- in which wizards on broomsticks 
compete in midair in a game some-
tiling like rugby and lacrosse com-
bined - is simply breathtaking. 

Film 
REVIEW 

Special effects also come into 
play at several points in "Sorcerers 
Stone," whether to bring life to the 
enchanted Hogwarts Castle or to 
breathe vibranty into the assort-
ment of backdrops and villains that 
prance through Harty'S adventures. 
The film serves as an excellent 
reminder just what special effects 
can do for cinema when used prop-
erly; instead of filling in for bad 
writing or plot gaps, they erUlance 
and make possible tile tI1ings that 
rea lity simply cannot provide. 

Purists will note that very few 
changes have been made between 

UCSD

the book and the film. The script 
preserves the language of the 
books - its most notable change 
being the film's title (British audi-
ences will see "Harty Potter and 
tile Philosopher's Stone," just as 
the first Harry Potter book was so 
called in the United !(jngdom). 

The all-British cast preserves the 
particularly English feci of the 
world of Harry Potter, and filming 
locations included places such as 
Gloucester Cathedral and the 
Divinity School at Oxford 
University. However, anybody who 
has been to King's Cross Station, 
London, to see from where the 
fabled Hogwarts Express departs, 
will note with discernment that the 
film's "Platform 9-3/4" is not actu-
ally the same as the space between 
!(jng's Cross Platfonns 9 and 10, to

close to its source material. 

"Harty Porrcr and the Sorcerer's 
Stone" is certainly more tllan just a 
film for children. It is an escapade 
executed mindti.J of imagination 
and creativity with resJlCct for the 
wonder that even grown-ups still 
possess. It's worth the ticket price to 
go and indulge in Harry's world for

'The Grinch' packs plenty of 
special features and extras 
Sing-a-Iong, behind-the-scene featurettes 
some of the many additions to holiday film 
By BRENT HECHT 
Contributing Writer 

When Director Ron Howard 's live-action adaptation of the beyond-famous Dr. Seuss 
book "How the Grinch Stole 
Chrismlas" hit theaters late last 
year, audiences and critics alike 
ogled the astronomical production 
value and Jim Carrey's extravagant 
rendition of the Grinch character. 

The "Dr. Seuss ' How The 
Grinch Stole Christmas" DVD 
attempts to recapture much of the 
awe of the large-screen version 
through increased sound and video 
quality, for which DVDs are 
known. It even tries to expand upon 
the Grinch experience with a 
plethora of special features . 

No one who has seen "The 
Grinch" eould argue that color 
vibrancy is not a vital element of 
the movie's experience. Set against 
a background of blazingly white 
snow and with every character 
minus the dog dressed in amazing-
ly colorful costumes, accurate color 
is requisite for the film . 

Fortunately, the DVD delivers, 
especially in the scenes that ' take 
place in the Grinch's dark and drea-
ry cave hideaway, where the darker 
tones are extremely vivid . 
Unforrunately, in the scenes set in 
Whoville, the bright colors appear 
slightly washed out next to the blind-
ing white snow that covers the town. 

Although nothing special for a 
DVD, the enhanced visual quality 
does wonders for certain parts of 
the movie - especially those fea-
nlring Carrey. When the movie 
zooms in on Carrey, instead of the 
smoothed blur one would see on 
VHS, DVD viewers are given a 
revolting, amazing view of every 
contour and slimy hair on Carrey's 
extensively made-up face. 

~ DVD 
~ REVIEW 

The DVD's special features add 
to the movie experience almost as 
much as the enhanced video quali -
ty. However, the main feature, the 
"Spotlight on Location," is rather 
disappointing. The fearure does its 
best to dumb down the genius of 
the people behind "The Grinch" 
to the lowest common-audience 
denominator, only barely illumi-
nating the very surface of each ele-
ment of production. 

Fortunately, more involved 
viewers can watch the specialized 
featurettes that respectably cover 
the incredible makeup production, 
design of the biggest set 
Hollywooc\Jlas ever created, visual-
effects team that handled over 300 
shots, and "Who School," in which 
the actors were taught in detail how 
to act, move and be Whos. These 
fea turettes will make the pickiest of 
moviephiles gape in awe at the 
genius, sweat and tears that went 
into producing "the biggest motion 
picture production in years," and 
are alone worth the price of the 
DVD. 

The DVD al~ includes features 
intended for small children, who 
obviously make up a large portion 
of the movie's audience. These fea-
nlres, which include a sing-a-long, 
a read-a-long and a "Dress tile 
Grinch" game, are excellent activi-
ties for small children and are 
designed in such a way that small 
children can easily navigate 
through them. 

Unfortunately, the DVD's 
remaining special features are

Weezer rides high on 'The Green Album' 
Jimmy Eat World and Tenacious 0 to open at the Cox Arena 
By BRENT HECHT 
Contributing Writer 

Tuesday night, Weezer, the most popular " post-slacker" group around , will play to a 
sold-out crowd at the Cox 
Arena . 

Weezer hit it big in 1994 with 
their very first album. The self-
titled album spawned three now-
legendary singles: " Undone-
(The Sweater Song)," "Buddy 
Holly" and "Say It Ain't So." 

The band also managed to grab 
several M1V Music Video Awards 
for its "Buddy Holly" video. All 
tllis within a year of the band's 
major-label debut. 

A tad overwhelmed by their 
rampant success, the band took 
an extended break after the 
hoopla died down. Songwriter, 
gu itarist and lead singer Rivers 

thei r third album, "The G reen Concert Album." 
T he new record, which has so far 

PREVIEWS produced three singles - " I lash Pipe," "Island in the SlUl" and 
Cuomo defied the rock star high-
school diploma stereotype and 
used hi s time off to attend 
Harvard Unive rsity. Bassist Matt 
Sharp and drummer Pat W ilson 
created their own side project: a 
band call ed The Rentals, and 
guitarist Brian Bell also esta b-
lished his own group, T he Space 
Twins. Sharp later left Weezer to 
work on The Rentals exclusively 
and was r eplaced by Mikey 
Welsh. 

Earlier this year, almost five 
years after the lackluster sa les for 
"Pinkerton," Weezer re -estab-
lished themselves as ultra -success-
ful musicians with the release of 

"Photograph" - has gone platinum 
and is still on "new release" shelves. 

Sti ll sporting the same geck-
chic look they helped popularize , 
Weezcr is currently playing 
extended dates of their tour in 
support of "The ,reen "";ulll," 
dubbed the "Midget lour."

Talking about the music with Ian Moore 
Texas native speaks of record label troubles and 'dreamy' music 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

It 's hard to imagine what a singer's voice will sound like without a rolling drumbeat or 
the strumming of guitar accompa-
niment. 

The voice of Ian Moore defies 
explanation. 

Inexplicably absent is the 
Texan drawl, which one would 
expect from a man raised in 
Austin, Texas. Instead Moore 
speaks with clarity, only slightly 
sarurated with fatigue from his 
recent 10-day West Coast tour. 

Moore began his professional 
career as a teen-ager playing for 
roots rocker Joe Ely in Texas. In his 
early twenties, Moore started his 
own band and expanded his style 
while opening for the Rolling 
Stones, Bob Dylan and ZZ Top. 

"The music industry is a weird 
industry," said Moore, who ran into 
conflict with his record company, 
Capricorn Records, early on in his 
career. 

Whil e Moore characterizes 
these troubles as "something that 
everyone in the industry goes 
through," the resulting creation of 
his own record label enabled him to 
explore himself as an individua l 
artist. 

"It has allowed me to have more 
freedom. I like being able to do 
whatever I feel like," Moore said. 

Today Moore resides in Vashon 
Island, Washington. However, 
Moore maintains his Texas connec-
tion through his band Action 
Company, which is still based in 
Texas. 

"It is easier to write moodier 
songs in a moodier place," Moore 
said, when asked about how 

Washington has inOucnccd his 
most recent music. "The environ-
mental and regional difference has 
certainly played a role." 

Beyond everything, i\ loore is a 
songwriter. Despile having just 
released a new albulll, "Via 
Satell ite," with Action Company, 
Moore ha hi t the road solo. He is 
taking the oppornmity to "strip 
down" his sound and bring some-
thing new to his alldicncc~. 

"Dreamy" is how ,\I oure char-
acterizes his performance>, and fans 
that choose to attend 1m show at 
lne Casbah will be in for a reverie 
of sound. 

" I just want to nuke really beau-
tiful music," Moore said. 

The Hiatus Calendar on page 14 has 
all the information on Moore's 
upcoming show.

Rochelle Rochelle is the buzz name in the San Diego rock scene right now. Recendy, they 
were named by the San Diego 
Music Awards "Best New Artist 
2001." In this interview with the 
Guardian, lead singer and guitarist 
Erik Berg shows Rochelle Rochelle's 
true colors and gives some advice to 
aspiring San Diego area Musicians.

Q: In a San Diego market flood· 
ed with young rock bands, what 
do you think gave Rochelle 
Rochelle the "New Artist of the 
year" award at the San Diego 
Music Awards? 
A: I think it was a combination of a 
few things: One, I think our live 
show is definitely something that 
sells us. We really work off the 
energy of the crowd, and I think 
the crowd feels that. Two, our 
music is different and good. It 
stands out amongst other local 
bands. And three, we worked really 
hard at making people notice us in 
this town. We did interviews with 
all the local radio stations, music 
magazines, played Street Scene ... 
we tried to make more noise than 
any other local band. I think we did 
a pretty good job at that.

record a demo of it at my house 
with all the instruments finished 
and bring it to practice to play for 
the guys. Then I show them how to 
play it. 

The other 10 percent of the 
time I'll come in with a song that is 
almost finished, but I might not 
have a bridge yet, or I'm not sure 
how to end it or how many times to 
repeat this part or that part, and 
then we'll kind of finish it together. 
It's definitely not much of a collab-

band, but it works for us that way.

Stoner: 
McGwire steps aside 
with dignity and class 
Continued from pace 20 
it to the Cardinals and the fans of 
St. Louis to step aside so a talented 
free agent can be brought in as the 
final piece of what I expect can be a 
World Championship.caliber 
team." 

Honestly, how much class does 
that take - to recognize that you 
can no longer dominate a game you 
once found so easy) To be able to 
turn aside personal glory for the 
sake of the team and the fans? 
There are very few athletes in tmy 
league who would be able to malce 
the decision that McGwire did. 

Who can blame McGwire for 
walking away from the game with 
his head held high? He adamantly 
said that he does not want to be one 
of those athletes who hangs around 
longer than he should; those once-
heroes that just slowly and painful· 
ly fade away while refusing to rec-
ognize their good years are behind 
them. 

Babe Ruth is a perfect example. 
After the Yank.ees decided Ruth's 
career was done, he went to the 
Boston Braves and played terribly, 
often getting booed by the Boston 
fans before he finally retired mid-
way through the season. 1 don't 
blame McGwire one bit for retir-
ing . 

But there are people out there 
who feel that McGwire shouldn 't 
retire - that he should keep play-
ing and chase that elusive 600 
home-run mark. 

To these ignorant fa ns: That 
attirude reflects the sad state that 
sports is in today. Athletes today 
chase numbers and individual sta-
tistics - most often in direct detri -
ment to their teams. How many 
batters have tried to hit a home run 
on a 3-0 pitch and popped out 
when their team needed baserun-
ners) You fa ns are the type who 
propagate this mentality. 

Sure, McGwire could pro bably 
hobble through anothe r year, 
maybe even rwo. He could certain-
ly hit 17 more home runs. Ye t he 
would be a liabi lity to his team the 
whole rime. H e can barely run at 
all , he is limited defensively as a 
fi rst baseman and he has been easi-
ly ncutralized the past two years 
with a simple free pass to fi rst basco 

O r he could do the noble thing 
and step aside, opening up $30 mil -
lion for the Cardinals to spend in 
the free·agent market and hel p the 
team ami community he deeply 
cares about to make it furthe r into 
the postseason next year. 

Let this g reat man follow his 
morals and step aside. Instead of 
greedily complaining about what 
he hasn't done, envelop yourself in 
what hc has achieved for the game 
of baseball , fo r his team and for 
himself; always in that order and 
always the way it should be. 

AOTW: 
Freshman looks forward 
to playoff volleyball 
Continued from pace 20 
been in the starting lineup for 
much of the year, Dunsmore came 
off the bench against Chico State 
because it was senior night for 
UCSD and the seniors received the 
majority of playing time. 

Now Dunsmore and the entire 
Triton volleyball team will look to 
the playoffs, where they hope to 
make a big impact. 

"1 think that we are peaking at 
the right time," Dunsmore said. 
"We feel strong and prepared. All 
of the girls have faith . We are look-
ing forward to the competition, 
whoever we play." 

Dunsmore is the second Triton 
to receive this award for this sea· 
son . Senior middle blocker 
Kathleen Hentz al so received the 
award for the week of Oct. 8 
through Oct. 14.

Soccer bags MVP, coach of the year 
UCSD defensive player named CCAA's best while coach also grabs top honors 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

UC D women 's soccer has excelled 
beyond anyone's wi ldest dreams. 

Over the past 15 years, Trjton soc-
cer's head coach Brian McManus and 
his squads ecured nine Division III 
Regional Championships, five 
Divi ion III National Championships 
and onc Division II ationa l 
Championship. 

when the CCAA named him the 2001 
CCAA coach of the year. 

Cuder was surprised when 
McManus told her she had been 
named the year's MVP. She did not 
expect the honor, according to 
McManus. 

She has been an imposing defen-
sive force for UCSD. The senior 
defender had four goals and five assists 
on the season, but her real contribu-
tions were immeasurable as a team 
leader and solid defender. Cuder has 
also been a team leader all year long. 

McManus commented that "how 
they played and how they produced is 
what has made me successful." 

McManus is excited about being 
named the 2001 CCAA coach of the 
year, but now will focus his attention 
on the playoffs. 

"Each game will be a battle 
because you don 't make it this far if 
you are a bad team," McManus said. 
"We must not make too many mis-
takes, but we must capitalize on the 
mistakes of others. " 

UCSD, one of eight teams left in 
the playoffs, is prepared to face its 
opponents. 

Cuder is confident and has the 
same feeling this year she did last year 
before earning the National 
Championship title.

with success , he still felt "excellent" 

lIe continued, "[Winning the 
Division II National Championship] 
last year was like a fairy tale - a blur. 
We just want to get back to the same 
place this year." 

"We are going all the way," Cuder 
said. "Everything is looking good 
and everything is clicking on the 
field ."

Triton named CCAA athlete of the week 
Freshman volleyball player earns honor for final week of the season 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

Traditionally, sports teams look to veteran 
players to carry them through the final weeks 
of the regular season. Veteran leadership is 
generally viewed as key in any playoff run. 
That's why it is such a bonus when a rookie 
steps up and plays well , as is the case with the 
UCSD women's volleyball team and fresh-
man outside hitter Stacy Dunsmore. 

Dunsmore improved her game over the 
last week of the season and earned the 2001 
Molten California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Women's Volleyball Player of 
the Week award for the week of Nov. 5 
through Nov. 11 - the final week of the 
regular season. . 

For the week, Dunsmore averaged 4.38 
kills per game on a .38 hitting average along 
with 2.9 digs per game and .88 service aces 
per game. 

Though just a freshman, Dunsmore has 
played beyond her years all season. She has 
not thought about her grade, but rather what 
she could do for the team. 

"I never doubted myself," Dunsmore 
said. "1 think that you have to play with 1:on-
fidence. 1 didn't come into the season think-
ing that I had something to prove, but 1 just 
wanted to contribute as much as I could to 
the team. It doesn't matter what grade level 
you're at." 

The freshman from Oceanside, Calif., 
played with confidence all season, but 
recently sent her game into another gear. 
Dunsmore was key in conference wins over 
Cal State Bakersfield (which is ranked 20th 
in the nation), UC Davis and Chico State, 
when the Tritons finished the season riding 
a six-game winning streak. 

, t - I ~ • 
' -......:. ~~ ,- ' Though the numbers speak for them-selves, Dunsmore was quick to point out that 

the team also deserved credit for the award. 

After beginning the week with a match-
high 14 kills to go along with a team-high 11 
digs in the three-game sweep of' the 
'Runners, Dunsmore followed the perfor-
mance up with a match-high 17 kills against 
UC Davis. --

Dunsmore has made a big impad on Triton volleyball. 

"I think that this award not onJy recognizes 
me, but the team as well," Dlmsmore said. 
"There are si~ people on the court and not just 
one. It shows that the team has been doing 
good things and coming up with big wins." 

She closed out the week with four kills, 
seven digs and three service aces in limited 
action against Chico State. While she had

Crew learns a lesson after hosting competition 
Tritons struggle overall but beat several Division I teams during event 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

UCSD men's and women's 
c rew took to the water on a clear 
Sunday morning last weekend in 
Mission Bay to participate in the 
Fall Rowing Classic. 

Competing against San Diego 
State University, University of San 
Diego, UC Irvine, Ari7.0na State 
University and several other com-
petitive club teams, UCSD's men's 
and women's crew teams gained 
some much-needed experience. In 
several events UCS D placed ahead 
of SDSU and UC Irvine, two 
Division I schools that offer schol -
arships . 

"We're racing against Division 
I schools with scholarships," said 

I (, 'E 

women's crew coach Patti 
Pinkerton. "It's a very uneven 
playing field ." 

UCSD men's crew started the 
day off for the Tritons on a posi-
tive note, placing third in the open 
four event with an elapsed time of 
23 :14, four seconds ahead of the 
SDSU and seven second ahead of 
UC Irvine. 

The men also placed in the col-
legiate eight competition, coming 
in fourth at 20:28. USD was the 
winner, running the course in 
19:55. 

The women's team had three 
novice boats in the junior novice 
eight race, and they all disappoint-
ingly finished in the bottom three 
spots, coming in eighth, ninth and 
1 Oth p'la~e . All were over three

Nov. 18, 5 p.m., Triton Soccer Stadium: Women's Soccer vs. Incarnate Word 

minutes behind the seventh-place 
Ari7.0na boat. 

However, Pinkerton was not 
disappointed with the low place-
ment of the women's novice boats. 

"The novice eight had three 
novice crews come in the tail end, 
but they've only been rowing a 
week," she said. "Traditionally, in 
the fall we don't do particularly 
well. I only put them in to see how 
they do and 1 was happy with 
that." 

The women's open eight boat 
fared better, rowing a 26:09 to 
place fifth overall. 

"[They] did quite 'well beating 
some open clubs," Pinkerton said. 

The women's team rowed to a 
strong finish in the open four 
event to grab third place with a 

time of 25:49, sandwiched behind 
two SDSU boats and ahead of two 
UC Irvine boats. 

"[I] was very pleased," 
Pinkerton said. "For us to finish 
third against SDSU and UCI is 
extremely well and our stroke was 
sick. The San Diego State team . 
was reaUy strong last year. " 

However, the women's colle-
giate eight boat wasn't as fortu-
nate, and came in last in its event. 

Despite the last-place finishes 
by the novice boats and the colle-
giate eight boat, Pinkerton came 
out of the event with a positive 
outlook. 

"For us to boat four novice 
crews in the fall is pretty oustand-
ing, " she said. "It's an indicator 
that our program is growing." 

here is one 
thing overshad-

owing Mark 
McGwire's 583 
home runs. 

It towers over his 6-foot-5, 250-
pound frame. It renders his massive 
arms, corded with- muscle, and his 
tree trunk-sized legs insignificant. 
It places him in a separate, elite cat-
egory from the rest of the sporting 
world's premier athletes. 

What, you ask, could reduce 
this titan - who is fifth on the 
career home run list and who hit 70 
home runs in one season - into an 
ordinary joe? 

His humility. 
The man who captivated the 

nation in 1998 with his chase of 
Roger Maris' single-season home 
run record retired Sunday. He 
walked away from a S30 million 
contract and the chance to become 
the fourth person in history .to hit 
600 home runs. 

So why w.ould he pass up a 
chance to add to his enormous 
legacy? Why is he retiring at 38 -
the same age at which Barry Bonds 
hit 73 home runs? 

I'll tell you why: It's because of 
who he is. The big man has an even 
bigger heart, and despite what 
some may say, I truly believe he is 
ending his l6-year career for all the 
right reasons. 

First of all, hel; definitely on the 
downside of his career, as he will 
readily admit. Last year he hit .187 
with 29 home runs and played in 
less than I ()() games. He h2s chron-
ic knee and back inj.uries that have 
kept him on and off the disabled list 
for the past two years. 

In a press release, McGwire 
stated, "After a considerable discus-
sion with those close to me, I have 
decided not to sign the extension, 
as I am unable to perform at a level 
equal to the salary the organization 
would be paying me. I believe lowe
