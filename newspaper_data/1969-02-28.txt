Regents Meet, Accomplish Little 
The Board of Regents met 

here last Thursday and Frid4y 
in an atmosphere of surrealistic 
calm in the face of massive police 
violence directed at the Ber-
keley students outside the build-
ing. 

By a narrow margin of votes, · 
the Regents declined to inter-
vene in the controversy sur-
rounding the extension of Her-
bert Marcuse's appointment as 
UCSO Professor of Philsosphy. 
Further, Berkeley Chancellor 
Heyns was not fired, as had been 
expected by many persons, in-
cluding Assemblyman Jesse Un-
ruh. The Regents proved to be 
surprisingly reluctant to take 
action on any of the highly pub-
licized matters facing them.

Faculty Passes Resolution 
At last Tuesday's meeting of 

the Academic Senate a resolution 
was passed which asserted the 
right of the University of Calif-
ornia faculty to collective bar-
gaining. This action was seen 
as the result of the situation 
at San Francisco State where it 
became evident that faculty mem-
bers were vulnerable to legal act-
ion in their strike. 

faculty members, staff members, 
or administrators. 

There was some discussion 
as to whether UC faculty mem-
bers are public employees or ' 
public officials. If the latter 
were true, then the faculty would 
be forbidden to strike. 

Library, E;xecutive and Univ-
ersity Welfare, and Special 
Scholar ships. 

One non-voting undergraduate 
may be invited. This under-
graduate shall be appointed by 
the AC:Ur.SD Senate and one 
non-voting graduate student, who 
is in turn appointed by a group 
of representatives consisting of 
one representative from each 
department. 

After much debate, showing 
some apprehension on the part 
of the faculty members, the re-
solution was passed. 

The most outstanding feature 
of this month's board meeting 
was the unprecedented length of 
the executive sessions. They 
lasted about eight hours alto-
gether, and it is suspected that 
they were almost completely con-
cerned with Marcuse's rehiring. 

On Thursday, Assemblyman 
John stull testified before the 
Committee on Educational Pol-
icy. He reportedly asked for the 
dismissal of both Chancellor Mc-
Gill and Dr. Marcuse. In a press 
conference immediately follow-
ing his appearance before the 
committee, Stull was asked if he 
were trying to curb the free 
discussion of revolutionary 
ideas. His reply was, "No com-
ment." He also encountered dif-
ficulty in explaining the relative 
calm on the San Diego campus, 
as he claimed that "violence 
and revolution follow Marcuse 
wherever he goes." 

At the open meeting of the 
committee that afternoon, a dis-
cussion of the future of ROTC 
programs was held. Regent Wat-

·kin's expressed hope that ROTC 
courses would be extended to all 
UC campuses. However, UC 
President Hitch expressed doubt 
as to the academic value of such 
courses, and impl1ed that he may 
recommend tbeir loss of credit 
in the near future. It is doubtful 
that this will be retroactive, how-
ever, as it was in the case of 
Social Analysis 139X. 

No mention of Marcuse was 
made during the open session on 
Thursday. 

The Committee on Finance 
met still later Thursday after-
noon. No action was taken on 
fees or tuition, except to recom-
mend that any proposed changes 
be referred to the Finance Com-
mittee. 

On Friday, the open session 
of the full boar.d passed a re-
solution creating severe penal-

Dr. Walter Monk, Chairman 
of the Academic Senate, opened 
the meeting by remarking how 
effective Chancellor Mcr.m was 
at the Board of Regents executive 
session last Thursday. He cont-
ended that the Regents, although 
wanting to reject Professor Mar-
cuse, became convinced that the 
UCSO faculty had acted res-
ponsibly and according to the 
proper rules. 

However, Psychology Oepart-
ment chairman, Dr. C.eorge 
Mandler, ultimately pointed out 
that it would make no difference, 
because, after the faculty had 
exhausted all legislative possi-
bilities to gain their due pro-
cess only one option would be 
open to them if they did not want 
to be smothered. This option 
would be to take action and 
strike. The resolution was 

Military Recruiters on Campus 

The faculty resolution was pre-
sented by Dr. ArnOld, and was the 
result of a special meeting ofthe 
Academic Senate held last Tues-
day to discuss the situation. This 
resolution, in addition to de-
claring faculty rights to due pro-
cess, gave support to the strik-
ing ~n Francisco State faculty. 

The resolution states that the 
Academic Senate is "opposed to 
the interference by the Board of 
Rege nts and the Board of Trust-
ees and by political groups and 
per sons, in the purely academic 
affairs of the University of Cal-
ifornia and state colleges .. ." 

It also condemns the use of 
violence to intimidate students, 

passed. 
The second item of import-

ance was a proposal presented 
by Victor Rumsey, of the Aca-
demic Senate Executive and Wel-
face Committee, to n allow stu-
dents, on an experimental basis 
until the end of the academic 
year 1968-69, on certain Aca-
demic Senate committees, and 2) 
to set up a new committee to de-
vise a system of placing stu-
dents on all appropriate college 
and senate committees. 

The point was made that the 
Academic Senate must try to get 
undergraduates to identify with 
their college, not with the dep-
a,rtment ot their major. 

The committees included in 
Part 1 are: Academic Freedom, 
Educational Policy and Courses 

ReG Notes the Rules 
Professor stroll presented to 

the RCG two motions relating 
in a general and in a speCific 
way, respectively, to the inci-
dent involving Marine re-
cruitment on campus. 

The specific motion was tabled 
till next week, butthe body agreed 
that the academic community 
should "protect the rights ... 
of guests to pursue their leg-
itimate activities without being 
subject to interference by 
physical means or disruptive 
tactics. " 

The second motion noted that 
the university's Statement on 
Recruitment of November 10, 1967 
allows for these recruiters to 
conduct their business on cam-
pus. 

The RCG approved travel and 
publicity expenses for two fac-
ulty members from San Fer-
nando Valley state College. Dr. 
David Ostroff and Dr. Barry 

nclers will speak at UCSD on 
programs for minority students, 

due process in judicial hearings 
and negotiations with the admin-
istration. The talks will be 
presented in the H-L Auditorium 
on Wednesday, March 5, at 8:30 
p.m. 

The Center for PartiCipatory 
Education made the request and 

, it was approved in accordance 
with the general aim of the RCG 
to encourage disse mination of 
differing views. 

Tom Shepard explained the 
recent move by the AS Senate 
towards taking over the snack 
facilities of this university. 

The AS Auxiliary Enterprises 
Committee will put the students 
in control of facilities in the 
Basic Science Building on Muir, 
the North Dining Room at night 
on Revelle. and concession stands 
at athletic events. 

However, the Revelle College 
students will still have control 
over their menu and the RCG 
will get most of the profits. 

Tumed Away By Studen, Picke,s 
The US Marine Corps will 

probably not find many Ur.SO 
graduates in its officers train-
ing program. At least none were 
recruited by r.aptain David stout, 
whO found himself outnumbered 
outside the student Placement 
Office on the Matthews Campus 
last Friday. 

stout had come to keep his 
scheduled appointment at the 
Placement office to disseminate 
information and meet with inter-
ested (?) students. However, 
long before stout arrived, stu-
dents occupied the steps of the 
office. Some 50 students clu-
stered around the steps, although 
probably only 25 actually part-
icipated in physically blocking 
the entrance. 

As a result of their actions 
several students are liable to 
disciplinary action. Dean of 
Student Affairs George Murphy 
said that he has received com-
plaints from several members of 
the academic community. and is 
currently attempting to verity 
the names of those involved. 

The students will have the 
choice of accepting the decision 
of several administrators, or 
may have their cases referred 
to the r.ommittee on Student 
Conduct, which consists of four 
students and four faculty mem-
bers. Murphy declined to com-
ment on the nature of any dis-
ciplinary action, but did say that 
talk of expulsion was "im-
mature." 

At about 9:00 a.m. Friday 
morning a Naval Aviation Corps

representative arrived - flashy 
sports car and all, - surveyed 
the situation, and beat a hasty 
retreat. 

However, .when Captain stout 
arrived at 10:00 a.m. he was 
greeted by Dean of Student Af-
fairs George Murphy at the pol-
ice station, where he was brief-
ed on the situation. When Mur-
phy 'and Stout arrived at Build-
ing 250, several faculty members 
tried to persuade them to avoid 
a confrontation since, they said, 
the situation on campus was 
"tense." because of the Berk-
eley riots and the Marcuse dec-
ision. 

An hour's discussion ensued 
outside the building, during which 
several alternatives were dis-
cussed. It was sugges ted that 
the Captain meet in a larger 
auditorium with all those who 
wished to discuss the Marines. 
Then the two students who had 
private appointments set up would 
be able to meet with Stout later 

the day. 
However, there was no gen-

eral consensus, and Murphy in-
formed the crowd that he would 
attempt to escort the Captain into 
the building. After having in-
formed the students blocking the 
steps that they were violating 
university regulations, Murphy 
was unable to accomplish this, 
and escorted stout back to the 
police station. 

The students' action was in 
violation of a university policy 
of open recruitment that was ap-
proved last year by the Aca-
demic Senate and the A.S.Senate. 
However, at Monday night 's A.S. 
Senate m~eting, a resolution was 
introduced, which will be voted 
on next week, calling for t mp-
orary suspen ion of all recruiting 
until revisions in the policy are 
made. 

ties for students "engaging in 
disruptive activity." The full text 
of this motion is reprinted else-
where in this issue. The gover-
nor must declare a state ofemer-
gency to exist on the campus be-
fore this statute may apply. 

Once this condition prevails, 
however, any student engaging in 
disruptive action will be placed 
on "interim suspension". at 
which time he may not enter any 
UC facility until his "hearing." 
If at this hearing he is found 
to be guilty of such actions, the 
student is suspended for a mini-
mum of one quarter. and may 
possibly be expelled. 

This measure was criticized 
by several Chancellors, including 
Cheadle of Santa Barbara, who 
told the Regents that they were 
"way behind the times." Regent 
Roth accused Reagan of "seeking 
simple solutions with a minimum 
of understanding of the demands 
of the time." Reagan slammed 
a pencil onto the table in re-
sponse. 

Following the open session, 
the Regents went into executive 
session again. 

Emerging at 6:30 p.m., Mc-
Gill stated Marcuse had been re-
tained, and that he would still 
be Chancellor. "though my tail-
feathers have been singed con-
siderably." Later, Hitch held a 
press conference, and confirmed 
this. 

ThUS, it seems that McGill's 
tactics paid off. He stated Mon-
day that he hoped "the students 
will accept me as leader, eve,n 
though I cannot always publicly 
show all my cards." He attribut-
ed his success directly to the 
fact that Reagan arrived at the 
meeting unaware of McGill's 
strategy, and that Reagan was 
therefore able only to rant and 
rave, but not to gather votes. 

CADEMIC SENATE STATEMEN 
1. We are opposed to the 

interference by the Board of 
Regents and the Board of Trust-
ees, and by political groups and 
persons, in the purely academic 
affairs of the University of Cal-
ifornia and the state colleges; 
and we affirm that the perogative 
for establishing educational pol-
icies lies fundamentally with the 
faculty -- both at the university 
and at the state colleges, as 
for example, in ~n Francisco 
State. 

2. We oppose the use of 
any means other than reasoned 
persuasion and peaceful demon-
stration to influence the educa-
tional pOlicies of these insti-
tutions. Specifically, we con-
demn the use of violence or the 
threat of violence to intimidate 
students, faculty members. staff 
members, or administrators. 
Such intimidation threatens the 
personal and intellectual freedom 
of all members of the academic 
community. 

3. We support the prinCiple 
that public employees, like pri-
vate employees are entitled 
to the right of collective bar-
gaining with their employer; and 
we affirm our conviction that 
the denial of this right by any 
organ of government constitutes 
a discriminatory abridgment of 
the privileges of citizenship in 
a democracy. Specifically, in 
regard to the academic em-
ployees of the Univ~rsity of Cal-
ifornia and the state Colleges: 
we affirm their righ to col-
lective bargaining with the 
governing organs of t~ose in-
stitution ,and, ifnecessuy (i.e., 
after parliamenta ry means 
for correcting at)\! s have been 
exhausted), to th u e of the non-
violent trike a means of de-
fending and enforcing their pro-
fessional rights. mong th se 
we number the right of th in-
dividual faculty member to a 
contract of emplo m nt and the 
traditional right of acad mic 
fre dom and tenur .

of the Triton Times, we urged the university community to withhold Last Fridal a nu:r of ~tu­

The group of students who converged on McGill obviously wished to 
see him take a hard-line position with the Regents, thereby provoking 
an inevitable confrontation. Yet this was exactly what McGill wished 
to aVOid, for he knew that such tactics would be of no avail. It was 
made clear at that Tlleeting that the Chancellor felt strongly enough 
about his decision that he would resign if the Regents showed a lack 
of faith by overruling him; his resignation would have been followed 
by those of several other Chancellors and administrative officials. 
But McGill wanted to avoid saying what he knew would be interpreted

not approve of the ~mpany he's 
pushing would have been to simply 
stay away. Most students would 
have stayed away. And an act-
ive, organized boycott would have 
demonstrated our distaste both to 
him and to other students. 

None of the above actions were 
taken however. Instead some stu-
dents -- and despite all argu-
ments about how many, they were 
a very minute minority -- de-
cided that not only would they 
show their distaste for the mU-
itary, but they would also exer-
cise discriminatory selection of 
what recruiters will and will not 
be allowed to speak to Interested 
students on campus. 

These students argue that the 
university should not serve as a 
food source for the military-
industrial groups whom they view 
with antagonism. What do they 
propose to do with those stu-
dents who may have been in-
terested in mililary careers, or 
careers as scientists with a 
major corporation or with the 
government? They have a right 
to speak with representatives of 
their chosen field. Or do they? 
If the answer is "no" because 
one feels that the growth of the 
oppressive military and indus-
trial sectors must be stopped 
at all costs, then is the next 
step to bind and throw into pri-
son those who are interested in 
such careers? Or should we 
simply kill them In their sleep 
because they represent menaces 
to the future of society ? 

Whose society? All students'? 
Or the ideologically narrow por-
trait of society as painted by a 
few self-appointed messiahs? 
Very few students are satisfied 
with our civilization as it exists 
today. They are not apathetic, 
however, simply because they do 
not block a recruiter's path into . 
a building. 

At least some demonstrate 

their disapproval by not joining 
the military, by opposing and 
working to change the draft laws, 
by contributing constructive time 
and energy to the redemption of 
our society. Others, hopefully, 
keep alive and promote ideals by 
following them In their own lives. 
But we have not come to the age 
of the guillotine in this country 
yet, and we would be foolish to 
want to do so. 

Let those students who felt they 
could exercise their own judg-
ment on the rest of the stu-
dent body consider how they would 
feel if other oppositely-inclined 
political groups on campus de-
cided that the sns information 
booth represented and promoted 
an element dangerous to the pro-
gress of this society. This is 
the same kind of judgment that 
was exercised against the mU-
ltary recruiter, and these stu-
dents would then be justified in 
blocking access to the booth; 
turning away the SDS represen-
tatives, and even tearing down 
the booth, and keeping interested 
students away. 

The editorlal of the Indicator 
says that "This university will 
be reformulated in the interests 
of aU people." For once we 
would like to see these students 
behave in a manner consistent 
with what they say. "AU the 
people' means precisely that. 
There must be an end to uni-
lateral actions which infringe on 
the rights of some simply be-
cause a few people don't think 
that right should exist. There 
must be an ettort to express 
opinions -- no matter how zeal-
ous they may be -- in a manner 
consistent with the goalofunder-
standing and free choice. And, 
above all, there must be a true 
reformulation "in the interests 
of all the people" that recog-
nizes each man's right to both 
accede or refuse. 

CREDENCE CLEARWATE~ REVIVAL IN S.D. TONIGHT 

Soundings-Revival 
The dark room vibrates. 

The bass thunders through the 
walls and slowly blends with the 
smooth soundS of voice, guitar 
and drums. The Graveyard 
Train winds its way on a nine-
minute journey into the world 
of the Credence Clearwater Re-
vival. 

The group has come a long 
way since its beginnings in San 
Francisco many years ago. They 
pl~yed there under a variety of 
names including the Polywogs. 
They played around the city until 
they were picked up by Andy 
Warhol and hit it big with their 
earthy remake of ·Suzie-Q: 
an old song once done by the 
Rolling stones. While their first 
album came on st rong blues, 
the second seems to have pro-
gressed to more of a blues-
rock sound, the chord pattern of 
gloomy on the first album has 
changed to that of Graveyard 
Train on the second. The sounds 
of " Bayou Country" and "Roll-
ing on the River" mixed with 
"Keep on to me", have a bit 
more of a happy sound to them 
than the s traight blues songs. 
In this second albu m the group 
shows that it possesses the a-
bility to progress and makes you 
wonde r where the thirdalbum will 
be at. 

Not so well known is an album 
just out from Buddah records 
which could be a sleeper. The 
album is Two Jews Blues and 
the name on the cover Is Barry 
Goldber g, who plays what I con-
sider some of the most soulful 
organ I've ever heard. The 
other half of the ethnic duo is 
a mystery. The question arises: 
who is it really playing the guitar, 
is he Jewish and can't be men-
tioned on the cover (because of 
contractual obligations)? 

It's only a mystery until you 
put it on the stereo. As soon 
as you hear the soft voice of 
the guitar you know it can only

Hip Community Organizes 
by Craig Starr 

Last week another reporter and 
I went to Ocean Beach to attend 
a meeting in a community meet-
Ing hall caIled the "In-Between." 
The purpose for going was to 
collect information about a group 
called RAP, the Revolutionary 
Actioo Party. 

As it turned out, RAP effect-
Ively did not exist. It was the 
idea of one person which was 
printed up in the san Diego 
Free Press and then exploited 
by San Diego's infamous TV 
personality, Harold Keen. 

What we discovered did exist, 
however, more than justified our 
being present. RAP was sup-
posed to represent an ettort by 
the members of the hip com-
munity of Ocean Beach to de-
fend themselves against per-
secution and discrimination by 
other "straight" members of 
the area. What may come as a 
surprise to many readers -- as 
indeed it was to me -- is that, 
although RAP does not exist, 
there are a number of groups 
within the hip community of San 
Diego -- not just Ocean Beach--
whIch are efforts by its members 
to offer self-help, identity, and 
a sense of community to this 
otherwise ignored and disdained 
segment of our population. 

Among these groups are VOY-
Voice of Youth - which is a com-
munication group; Halfway 
House, whose "Open-Door Pro-
gram" plans to provide medical 
and ambulence service for. heads 

with an overdose as well as re- efforts and the objectives of 
habilitation services and general these groups.

Police and Students Battle 
Sproul Plaza at UCB • In 

By Clay Anderson 
As the Regents of the Univ-

ersity ot California met in pond-
erous formality on the outskirts 
of the Ber~eley campus, the 
real news of the day was being 
made on the streets by the stu- . 
dents. In a climax to weeks 
ot tension and sporadic outbreaks 
of violence, the campus and the 
adjacent Telegraph Avenue were 
the scene of battles between pol-
ice and students. 

The background behind the con-
nict lies in the negotiations which 
were being held between the ad-
ministration and the minority 
groups on campus. These neg-
otiations centered around the est-
ablishment of some sort of eth-
nic studies program, consisting 
of several different departments 
or possibly the creation of a 
Third World College. As the 
negotiations inched forward and 
became enveloped in a fog of ' 
secrecy and rumor, a strike was 
called and picket lines appeared 
at different points throughout the 
campus. 

The strike and subsequent boy-
cott of classes was only sup-
ported by a fraction of the stu-
dents , while the great majority 
found the issues involved too 
vague to draw a commitment. 
The picket lines that we re set 
up were the scene of sporadic 
fights and shoving matches, but 
the most surprised people to hear 
Reagan declare the campus to 
be in an "extreme state of emer-
gency" were the students them-

selves. 
Following this declaration, 

police were moved on campus 
and strike support increased en-
ormously. The officers on duty 
were the Berkeley police, the 
Highway patrol and the Alameda 
County Deputy Sheriffs, who were 
known for their blue overalls 
and referred to locally as the 
"Blue Meannies ." Confronting 
the cops was a mixed bag of 
striking students, striking teach-
ing assistants, and several or-
ganizations such as the Black 
students and the Third World 
Liberation Front. 

Thus the chant of "pigs off 
campus" was added to the other 
chants of "strike! ," "Third 
World College" and "we are 
the people." The strike which 
had seemed to be losing had 
been given a new issue, one which 
soon brought students into the 
plaza and disruption to the cam-
pus. 

The plaza in question is bord-
ered by Sather Gate on the North, 
Sproul Hall on the East, the 
student Union on the West and 
by Bancroft Avenue on the South. 

Tom Baker and] arrived on 
campus Thursday, February 20, 
and immediately inquired about 
the violence of the previous few 
days. We were told that Sproul 
plaza had been the scene of pol-
ice-student battles, especiallv 
on Wednesday, andthatthe school 
was outraged at the senseless 
beatings which had been carried 

AS Senate Notes 
First order of business at the meeting was the announCE'me,lt that 

the Revelle College Government had chosen Greg Harm to replace 
Bill Eastman in the senate. _ 

Tom Shepard first spoke about violence and resistance on this and 
other college campuses, and then went on to report on last week's 
Regent's meeting. He announced that the Regents were "investigating" 
the authority to make faculty appointments, a power which now rests 
with the chancellors. It was also announced that if the governor were 
to declare a 'state of emergency', students could be suspended for up 
to two weeks without trial. 

A larger part of the meeting was taken up by Dean Murphy's detailing 
of the events last Friday with the Marine recruiter. Passing no judgment 
upon the participating students, he answered questions from the senate 

after~ards. It was also announcedatthe meeting that the AAU P (Amer-
ican Association of University Professors) and the ACLU (Ame rican 
Civil Liherties Union) both favor open recriutment by any organization. 

Greg Harm presented a resolution which will be voted at the next 
meeting. In it, he advocates a closed system ofrecruttment, allowing 
only academic organizations to recruit on campus. This, however, 
would not deny any organization the right to disseminate literature on 
campus. He felt that since a completely open system of recruitment 
was displeasing both to the University and the students, it should be 
discontinued. 

steve Greenberg introduced a motion to allocate $135 so that rooters 
could attend the NAlA basketball tournament at Biola. The motion was 
defeated.

This student anger was plain-

ly visible when we entered 
Sproul plaza about noon Thurs-
day. A rapidly growing picket 
line was circling through ~ther 
Gate, while cops in yellow rain-
coats were lined up underneath 
the Gate keeping a corridor open 
for non-strikin6 students. 

The atmosphere was incred-
ibly tense as the crowd gath-
ered in large numbers both north 
and sou th of Sather Gate. The 
cops were helmeted with tear 
gas masks in bags on their 
waists. The crowd grew to 
several thousand and continued 
to chant loudly while the cops

We crossed this line of cops 
and walked slightly in front of 
them as they proceeded down the 
street. People were huddled 
inside the stores, having been 
let in by many owners in order 
to escape the gas. Rocks were 
flying but stores were not being 
broken into and cars were not 
being damaged. Several trash 
barricades were burning in the 
streets and the police were ad-
vancing in orderly fashion. 

We stopped on a streetcorner 
to watch the cops and observe 
the small knots of people who 
were standing in the street and 
on the sidewalks. Many of the 
traffic lights were out ot order, 
reportedly put that way by a 
huge, wild-eyed man who had 
beat the hell out of the central 
boxes with a pipe.

Meeting the Police State 
By Toml Baker 

As a member of the student 
class in American society, ] 
have led the sott, easy life which 
typifies the existence of most 
college people. 

] had been a supporter of Eu-
gene McCarthy last year, and had 
felt remorse at the tact that I 
did not go to Chicago last summer 
to support the good man. I 
was even a good deal outraged 
by the actions of the Chicago 
Gladiators and their boss, Big 
No-chin the Monolith, who had 
done so much to repress the hon-
est needs for reform in Amer-
ican life. 

For some time after the Con-
vention I was able to engage in 
ve ry heated arguments over the 
action ot the Chicago storm 
troopers. However, as with most 
other people , the issue soon faded ' 
from prominence, though not 
without tempering a quiet dis-
trust in my attitude toward the 
police. 

The reason tor the passing 
of my anger was one which I 
believe is fundamental to the 
existence of most students in 
America - the tendency to re-
late to everything in the abstract, 
to experience everything vicar-
iously at best, and to intellec-
tualize away the concrete real-
ities of contemporary life. 

How often have I witnessed 
the truly pathetic spectacle of 
students in a certain sociology 
class here arguing over whether 
or not Harlem is or is not a 
ghetto, i.e., what constitutes the 
sociological definities ot a ghetto 
as opposed to the sociological 
defini tion of an ethnic community, 
or what have you (perhaps the 
sociological definition of a de-
finition). 

I mention this example as an 
illustration of the way in which 
we are brought up to regard the 
world as essentially objective, 
something over which we have no 
control and are Indeed taught to 
regard as unreal. In such an 
environment, man ceases to be 
man , but becomes a clinical auto-
maton passively accepting the 
world which is oppressing him. 
The tendency to regard things 
in the abstract serves to pacify 
man - he becomes unable to 
assert himselfas his own master. 
It is thus that he becomes unable 
to rebel. 

The refore, at Berkeley last 
week , upon encountering tear gas 
and billy clubs in the hands of 
real, angry cops, for the .first 

No matter 

time in my lite my initial reac-
tion was a sort of contused but 
strong curiosity. ' Along with 
Clay Anderson, I felt it absolu-
tely imperative that we get down 
close, to see what was happen-
ing and to find out what these 
things felt like. 

Accordingly, we lett AS Pres-
ident Tom Shepard behind a fence 
and ventured down into the Plaza 
between Sproul Hall and the Stu-
dent Union building. 

When we were close to the 
fountain near the Union, I smelled 
something reminiscent otburn-
ed-out fireworks which some-
one told me was a faint wisp 
of tear gas. When we got to 
the Student Union, the odor had 
increased. My eyes were now 
water Ing and hurt a little. 

From our vantage point by the 
Union , we saw two opposing arm-
ies facing each other across 
about twenty yards of no- man's 
land. Some rocks were being 
thrown, and every so often a 
cop would fake like he was throw-
ing another tear gas cannister. 
The students crept closer to the 
cops, some sneaking around the 
side of Sproul Hall throwing rocks 
at point blank range . A thund-
erous roar of "Pigs OFF Cam-
pus" started up. The students 
got too close and suddenly one 
or two cannisters were thrown 
into the crowd. The students 
fled screaming. But soon they 
were back, venturing even closer 
to the police lines. 

Clay and I had by now re-
ceived a good taste ot this gas, 
and were choking and crying. 
A girl came up with wet towels 
which eased the gas' effects con-
siderably. We were now be-
coming angry, and found our-
selves yelling at the cops al-
most unconsciously. 

We went back Into the Plaza 
to observe the students who 
seemed to be merely watching. 
A helicopter appeared overhead. 
Suddenly, the pigs executed a 
pincers movement around two 
sides of the building, catching us 
where the two columns met. A 
cannister exploded a few feet 
away. We were in a crowd and 
trapped by a wall which ran par-
allel to a gulley. The gas be-
came unbearable. The crowd 
was pushing and screaming. we 
were unable to get away. 

Finally the crowd dispersed 
enough for us to reach the wall, 
which I Jumped in the best form

gas choking me, I Just kept run-
ning. Later I went back there, 
but the notebook was gone. 

We then went up to the second 
floor of the student Union to get 
a general overview of the scene. 
We watched as students smashed 
in the windows ofaBerkeleypo]-
ice car. The pigs appeared with 
a bizarre looking tear gas mach-
ing gun which made a hell of a 
noise but did little else. My 
contempt for the pigs rose when 
the little tear gas it produced 
was blown by the wind back into 
the ranks of the pigs. 

One student threw a flower at 
a pig. He was instantly seized 
by about six pigs, beaten to a 
bloody pulp, and taken away. This 
was the only beating we saw at 
close hand. Some students be-
came enraged and went after the 
pigs. However, they stopped 
when other pigs arrived with 
more gas. 

Shortly thereafter, the pigs 
launched a massive, final as-
sault. One reported counted 
30 cannisters of gas thrown into 
SprOUl Plaza within a period of 
about two minutes. A huge cloud 
of gas 40 feet high hung over 
the Plaza, blotting out the sun 
somewhat. The pigs broke Into 
the Student Union, and used their 
tear gas machine gun to fill the 
lobby. One student came up to 
the balcony to announce that the 
pigs had taken over the Union, 
but had agreed to allow us to 
come down if we desired. For 
the first time, I got a glimpse 
of what it must feel like to be 
a prisoner of war. We walked 
down through the gas filled lobby 
and emerged out on the street 
choking. 

The battle had moved out onto 
Telegraph Avenue. A huge crowd 
of students tUled thA street. A 

KRLA reporter hassled by police, later beaten during week of violence 
on UC Berkeley Campus, 
few fires were set in intersec-
tions. No looting or smashing of 
store windows occurred. Indeed, 
the shopkeepers opened their 
doors so students could escape 
the gas. The pigs threw some 
tear gas into the streets, dis-
persing the crowd fairly effec-
tively. We left at dark, when most 
of the students had gone home. 

A curfew was declared, and the 
pigs set up check points around 
the university, blocking anyone 
from entering_ The university 
was open the next day, however. 
The possibility of a recurrence 
of the previous day's violence 
was destroyed by rain, which 
proved to be the most effective 
crowd control technique present-
ly known. 

Later that night, ] tried to 
read. This proved impossible, for 
I was disturbed and angry about 
the day's events. Some of my 

views were changing. "Riots" 
lost their monstrous Hydra-like 
nature, which my abstract know-
ledge of them had created. Ex-
perienCing it first hand, being 
part' of such a battle, gave it a 
new meaning. The struggle be-
came a reclamation of humanity, 
the reclamation of man as man. 
Rebellion became a tirst step 
towards freedom. Out in that 
Plaza I had been afraid, but I 
was also nearly intoxicated by 
the heady feeling of power and 
individual worth I experienced. 
For a few moments I had felt 
really free. 

Further, the very effectiveness 
of the storm troopers exposed 
their mortal weakness. As much 
tear gas as they threw, they 
could not beat the students into 
submission. The pigs and their 
tear gas are the last (choking) 
gasp of decadance in this society. 
They can't last.

IBM ·invites you to join an infant industry. 

Big as it is, the information processing 
industry is just beginning to grow. 
Recently, Fortune estimated that the value 
of general purpose computers installed in 
this country will more than double by 1972. 
Other publ ications have other predictions, 
and probably no source is totally precise. But 
most agree that information processing is 
one of America's fastest growing major 
industries. 
Every day, it seems, computers go to work 
in a new field or new application. IBM com-
puters are working in such diverse fields as 
business, law, medicine, oceanography, 
traffic control, air pollution. Just about any 
area you can name. 
To somebody just starting out, this growth 
means exceptionally good chances for 
advancement. Last year, for example, we 
appointed over 4,000 managers-on 
performance, not seniority. Here are four 
ways you could grow with IBM: 

Engineering and Science 
"The interdisciplinary 

environment keeps 
you technologically 
hot." ,~ 

... 

"Working in data process-
ing today pretty much means 
you work in a broad spectrum 
of technologies," says Nick 
Donofrio. 
An Associate Engineer at IBM, Nick is a 
1967 graduate in Electrical Engineering. 
He's using his technical background to de-
sign circuits for computer memory systems. 
Nick says, "Your specialty at IBM can take 
you into the front yard of half a dozen dif-
ferent fields. In my job, for example, I work 
with systems design engineers, chemists, 
phYSicists, metallurgists, and programmers. 
The diversity helps me keep up to date on 
the latest technologies." 
Career areas in engineering and science 
at IBM include: Research, Design & Develop-

Other reasons to consider IBM 
1. Small Team Concept. No matter how large 
a project may be, we break it dl)wn into 
units small enough to be handled by one 
person or a few people. Result: quick recog-
nition for achievement. 
2. Education:]1 Support. IBM employees 
spend over tllirteen million hours a year in 
company-sp'Jnsored educational and training 
programs. Alld plans like our Tuition 

if' : 

ment, Manufacturing, Product Test, Space 
and Defense Projects, and Field Engineering. 
You'll needatleasta B.S. in any technical field. 

Marketing 
"Working with 
company presidents 
is part of the job." 

"I'm pretty much the 
IBM Corporation in 
the eyes of my 
customers," says 
Andy Moran. "I 
consider that fairly good for an engineer 
who graduated only two years ago." 
Andy earned his B.S.E.E. in 1966. Today, 
he's a Marketing Representative with IBM, 
involved in the planning, selling and installa-
tion of data processing systems. 
Andy's customers include companies with 
annual sales ranging from 20 million 
to 120 million dollars. He often works 
wlth executive vice-presidents and presi-
dents. Andy says, "At first I was a little 
nervous about the idea of advising execu-
tives at that level. But by the ti me I fi nished 
training, I knew I was equipped to do the job." 
Career areas in marketing at IBM include: 
Data Processing Marketing and Systems 
Engineering, Office Products Sales, and 
Information Records Sales. Degree require-
ment: B.S. or B.A. in any field. 

Finance 
"You're in an ideal 
spot to move 
ahead fast." 

"I've always figured my 
chances for advance-
ment would be better 
in a growth industry. 
That's why I picked 
IBM," says Joe Takacs. 
Joe's been working 
in general accounting

since he got his B.B.A. in June, 1968. Growth 
wasn't the only reason he chose IBM. He 
says, "I learned that it's general practice at 
IBM to promote from with)n and to promote 
on merit alone. I like that. 

"Another growth factor is the job itself," 
Joe says. "During my first few years, I'll get 
experience in nearly every area of general 
accounting -Income & Expense, Balance 
Sheet, and so on. I'll be learning how the 
company is structured and how it operates 
on a broad scale. That's exactly the kind of 
knowledge I'll need to help me qualify for

Programming 
" It's a mixture

is prac-
tically use-
less until some-
body writes a 
program for it," 
says Earl Wilson. 
Earl got a B.A. in Modern 
Languages in June, 1967. 
He's now an IBM programmer working on a 
teleprocessing system that will link the 
computerized management information 
systems of several IBM divisions. 

Earl defines a "program" as a set of 
instructions that enables a computer to do a 
specific Job. "Programming involves 
science," says Earl, "because you have to 
analyze problems logically and objectively. 
But once you've made your analysis, you 
have an infinite variety of ways to use a 
computer's basic abilities. There's all the 
room in the world for individual expression." 
Career areas in programming at IBM include: 
Systems Programming, Applications Pro-
gramming, Programming Research, and 
Internal Programming for IBM's own use.

Baseball. A 8all or Strike? 
SPORTS 

i_SHORT.S 
8aseball by Larry Raful It looks like no organization 

these days is immune from labor 
strikes, and the latest strike is 
shaking the very foundations this 
country was built on. 

Mothers, apple pie bakers, and 
flag wavers are all aghast and 
shocked, for the baseball players 
of America were always sup-
posed to be above it all. But 
there they were, out on the plcket 
lines boycotting spring practice, 
and making like the Longshore-
men of the sports world. 

The problem was, of course, 
when they would settle the strike. 
But being true-blue American 
patriots they are, the valiant 
and courageous club owners went 
ahead with spring practice. They 
brought together one of the larg-
est groups of "he's a baseball 
player?" candidates ever assem-
bled. 

Therefore, it made one won-
der if the owners would have 
gone ahead and started the base-
ball season if the players from 
the Baseball Players Assn. hadn't 
signed their contracts. 

Althou~h the strike is settled, 
this is Just the latest In what 
baseball fans throughout the USA 
have had to put up with. I 
wonder how long they will hold 
up under all this. With this 
in mind, I take you to the fu t-
ure into the office of the Fed-
eral Mediation and ConcUlation 
Service where a meeting Is tak-
ing place between the baseball 
owner's representative and the 
representative from the Baseball 
Fans of America. 

"You're what??" 
"That's right. We fans feel 

it's high time baseball shapes up, 
and until it does, we are going 
on strike." 

"But you can't go on strike. 
Who will come to games? Who 
will watch the game of the week 
on television? We'll lose mil-
lions of dollars. " 

"That's not our problem. We 
are just plain American folk who 
want to see our National Pastime 
regain Its posltion of stature. 
And we don't Intend to support 
all this fooling around. We can 
wait this out as long as you can. 

Picket lines will start ... " 
"Plcket lines! Just a min-

ute. Now please sir, calm down 
and tell us exactly what changes 
you want. What are your de-
mands?" 

"That's more like it. Now, 
we want the fans to be shown 
a little more respect in the 
league." 

"Fine, fine. We give in to 
your demands. We accept. You-
're perfectly right. Now, if 
you'll just .. ,I ' 

"Not so fast. That's our first 
demand. We have more." 

That's what I was afraid of. 
Let's hear them." 

"Secondly, we demand better 
p:,lrklng facilities and under-
ground moving walkways so we 
don't have to walk such long ways 
to the stadium. We also want 
aU-weather stadiums, more 
comfortable seat s, and removal 
of all pillars that obstruct a 
full view of the !leld." 

"But the upper stands will 
collapse." 

"No matter. You should've 
thought of that before. Now, 
we also want cheaper prices for 
seats and the Mormon Tabernacle 
ChOir to sing the National 
Anthem. We want more foul 
balls hit to our sons ••• " 

"But we can't control that!" 
"\fanagement can solve any-

thing they want to, if they want 
to badly enough. Just put on 
your thinking caps. Now, we'd 
also like the players to stay 
around after the game and give 
the youngsters some free 
lessons. " 

"But sir, be reasonable. 
Underground walkways, new 
stadiums, more baseballs for 
fans - that wUl bankrupt me." 

"We're not done yet. I have-
n't even mentioned our most 
important demand." 

"You haven't? Well, go ahead, 
let's hear It. How much worse 
could it be? I'll be poor In 
a year, anyway." 

"WE the Baseball Fans of 
America, hereby demand the 
complete terminus of soggy hot 
dogs at the stadium." 

Luck and weather seem to be 
agaInst the UCSD baseball team 
In what practically amounts to 
its first year of competition. 
Last year's 12-game schedule has 
been expanded to 35 games this 
year. Unfortunately, this year's 
team is composed mainly 
of freshmen who have not played 
together before. Due to the rain, 
about the only time the members 
of the team get together is for 
the games, and the lack of prac-
tice Is evident. With 20 un-
earned runs in their first five 
games (all of them losses), luck 
certainly isn't favoring the Tri-
ton team. This is not to say 
that we have no good players --
we do -- and they are injured. 
Our star pitcher is out with a 
sprained ankle, and the team cap-
tain is out with a sprained knee. 

Realizing an inexperienced 
team can not hope to compete 
with more experienced est-
abUshed teams, Coach Keith 
Stowe said of the season, "How 
well we do depends on how much 
practice we get. II 

Golf, 
The Triton golf team suc-

cumbed to powerful UC Riverside 
in a 7-53 loss last Friday. Al-
though all of our golfers im-
proved their game by at least 
two strokes over previous tries, 
the powerful Riverside team was 
too much for them. The low 
medalist for UCSD was Ray Ger-
rity with a round of 78. Cal 
Western, who crushed the Tri-
tons earlier this season, handed 
San Diego State their first dual 
meet loss in three years, which 
indicates the strength of UCSD's 
opponents. Tuesday's scheduled 
match against state was can-
celled due to rain. 

Track 
The first official track meet 

of the 1969 season will be a 
home meet against So. Calif. 
College one week from today.

have helped determine the size 
and quality of this year's team,

CAGERS GO TO 
NAIA PLAYOFFS 

The UCSD basketball team, in 
its second season of varsity 
competition, has been voted to 
the four-team NAlA District In 
playoffs. 

The District III Executive 
Committee selected Whittier, 
Azusa Pacific, UCSD and Pas-
adena as first, second, third 
and fourth seeds , respectively. 

Whittier wlll play Pasadena 
tomorrow night, and UCSD will 
take on Azusa Pacific Monday 
night. 80th games are sched-
uled for 8'00 p.m. at Biola Col-
lege. 

Tickets will cost $1.00 for stu-
dents and $2.00 tor adults. No 
buses will be leaving from UCSD 
to Biola, so students will have 
to furnish their own transport-
ation. The PE office encourages 
students to go, and directions may 
be obtained by calling the PE 
otrlce, Ext. 2275. 

Triton Bob Desjardins was 
named to the IO- man first team 
of District m. Ed Babiucb re-
ceived honorary mention in the 
voting. Voting involved 18 teams. 

If the Tritons win both of 
tbelr playoff games, they will 
go to the five-day NAIA Nat-

. ional Championships in St. Louis. 
Commenting on the honor of 

being voted to the playoffs, Coach 
Nell Stoner said, "We owe our 
success to a team of dedicated, 
hard-nosed players. we got 
into the playoffs by a lot of 
come-through performances. In 
the playoffs, however, we wlll 
need come-through perform-
ances plus a little more." 

stoner went on to praise his 
players tor their eUorts. 
"Desjardins is our team leader 
and playmaker. He Is a good 
scorer, and he Is tough both 
mentally and physically," he 
commented. 

"F'd Babiuch and Dave Kiefer, 
our forwards, are consistent 
scorers, good rebounders, and 
they played well all year. They 
must do well In the playoffs if 
we are to win." 

"F'ver since we lost Ron Car-
ter at the term break ," Stoner 
commented, "Jeff MUl and steve 
Waddell, both inexperienced, 
have really come through to 
plug up the center spot." 

"Tn summation of the season," 
Stoner said, "we're not very 
big, not very fast, and not very 
strong. But we have players 
who shoot well, play well to-
gether, and most important of 
all play hard-nosed basketball." 

INTRAMURALS 
Monday night should not have 

come for the Butfakes, last year's 
Dorm League Intramural Basket-
ball Champions. 

The Weasels pulled out in front 
by 10 points at one time making 
the Butfakes go hard to close the 
gap to five points. With only 
seconds to go the Weasels went 
into a stall that was not broken 
before the final whistle. 

Ford Mastick was the man to 
stop, but there was no stopping 
him. He poured In a game high 
of 22 points for the Weasels, 
Guy Fulkerson was ' second high 
for the Weasels with 14, and 
Mark Waxman led the Butfakes 
with 15 points. 

It now seems that the Weasels 
and Butfakes wlll meet again to 
decide the championship. How-
ever the Butfakes must first tuck 
away the Seamen or BOL The 
game Is scheduled for tomorrow 
afternoon. 

Open league action saw the 
Faculty StaU forfeit to Physics 
in the first round of that cham-
pionship tournament. Maphds 

out-scored the DB's by 9 points 
In their first round meeting on 
Sunday afternoon. 

Monday night the Panthers went 
down to the WUd Tearers, 66-50, 
in a hard-pressed game. James 
Tait of the Panthers was high 
score with 22. steve Ahern had 
19 of the Wild Tearers 66. 

There are many good games 
to be seen as the intramural 
basketball tournament moves to-
wards its final date of March 9. 

The women's basketball be gins 
play tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. 
Tbese should prove to be very 
interesting games. The gals will 
play every weekend and on March 
6. 

Badminton Is now in progress, 
as Is two-man volleyball (which 
began last Saturday). Players are 
asked to show up this Saturday 
for continuation of play. 

Table tennis will begin March 
5, and will be played in the 
east end of the gym. Players will 
be coatacted by the intramural 
office.
