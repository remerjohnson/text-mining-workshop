John Muir 
Government 
Underway 

A viable Muir College govern-
mentwill soon be formed follow-
ing a year of frustration if plans 
now under way are successful. 

Government at Muir College 
began on October 16 of last year 
when a group of interested stu-
dents called a meeting of 20 
delegates - 2 from each of the 
dorms and 4 selected from among 
the commuters. 

The guiding philosophy ofthose 
students was that the traditional 
form of student government was 
irrelevant because it could only 
do student activities - it could 
not direct the total college life. 

Thus, the twenty delegates 
were asked to volunteer for one 
of 8 committees, composed Of 
administration and faculty as well 
as students that were to control 
such activities as -Governmen-
tal Space and student Center,· 
"student Projects,· and "Resi-
dence Halls Affairs.· 

These committees, on the 
whole, were effective. For ex-
ample, the Housing Policy com-
mittee secured the suspension 
of the incense rule and the visi-
tation policy enjoyed by Muir 
College students this year. 

However, other committees, 
such as the Nominations Com-
mittees, were dissolved after 
their functions were completed 
and thus, because only commit-
tees had any power, their mem-
ber s dropped out of government 
denying representation to their 
constituencies. 

At the end of last year, the 
delegates voted to dissolve the 
government, except for Ken Pa-
trick. Ken, elected president of 
the pr ovisional government, was 
appointed to act as the student 
government agent and mobilizer 
of formation of a new college 
government, until that govern-
ment was formed.

On Tuesday, October 29, JeH 
Benjamin called the Revelle stu-
dents ' government to order at 
12:00 in the Conference room of 
Blake Hall. No student observers 
were present. The representa-
tives discussed the Inter-Hall 
Judicial Board and the free 
speech area in the central plaza. 

Dean Murphy explained his 
concern over the future of the 
official free speech area on cam-
pus. The free speech area was 
instituted several years ago on 
the rationale that If we are to have 
speech on this campus that is 
h'uly free, then we must elimi-
nate the intimidating quantity of 
the outside news men and media. 

If what the college student 
says is recorded and can be used 
against him in the future, are 
the students really free to search 
for truth among themselves and 
with their teachers along the 
thorny path of mistakes? Dean 
Mur phy feels that cons traints on

A HALLOW.EEN SURPRISE from the GREAT PUMP.KIN ! ! 
----------------

Weisberg Raps Warren 
by Clayton Anderson 

Wblle much of the national 
interest in the Warren Com-
mission's report has faded in the 
face of this year's political batt-
les, the issue is merely sub-
merged, not extinguished. 

This was amply demonstrated 
last Monday night as a large 
crowd gathered in the Revelle 
cafeteria to hear Harold Weis-
berg condemn the Warren Com-
miss ion and its conclusions . 
Weisberg, author of "White-
wash" and several other books 
on John F. Kennedy assassina-
tion, spent several hours at UCSD 
answering questions and discuss-
ing his investigation of the mur-
der. 

Weisberg, whose appearance 
was jointly sponsored by TNC 
and the Assassination Inquiry 
Committee of San Diego, began 
his discussion with a short, but 
highly detailed list of incidents 
and characters which the Warren 
report failed to investigate. 

He talked about the CIA' s ef-
forts in organizing the anti-
Castro Cuban Revolutionary 
Council and how this council was 
supported in its efforts by a man 
named Bannister. Bannister was 
a former FBI agent who was a 
rabid racist and segregationist. 

David Ferrier was another 
character which was discussed, 
and Weisberg told his audience 
that the Ferrier file was being 
suppressed by the FBI for un-
discloded reasons. 

In general this discussion was 
too particular to be of interest 
to most individuals, but it did 
serve to demonstrate the com-
plexity which surrounds the mur-
der. 

Tuesday is election day. 
The Students for a Democra-

tic Society and Tuesday the Ninth 
Committee are sponsoring a 
teach-in on election day from 
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The teach-in 
will center around two issues: 
the meaning of elections and the 
meaning of law and order. 

There will be several speak-
ers, followed by individuals who 
will discuss dIfferent aspects 
of the topiCS with smaller groups. 

Students are asked to come to 
the teach-in Tuesday atternoo. 
Professors are being asked to 
dismiss their classes, or to al-

The next part of the discussion 
was of greater interest as Mr. 
Weisberg threw open the meetinr 
for questions from the audience. 
On the topic of John F. Kennedy, 
Weisberg contends that he was 
killed to prevent any shifts in 
American foreign policy. 

Not only was Kennedy moving 
toward reconciliation with the 
Russians , but he also wanted to 
reorganize the CIA. Bothofthese 
moves would have jeopardized the 
positions of many intelligence 
personnel, and Mr. Weisbergbe-
lieves that some of these people 
acted to protect their positions. 

Replvin£ tn questions about 
Rooert Kennedy, Weisberg stated 
that Kennedy had made no effort 
to contact Garrison or himself 
concerning their investigation. 
He also believed that Robert 
Kennedy's death was only a mat-
ter of time because those who 
murdered his brother couldn' t 
take the chance that Kennedy 
might r eopen the investigation. 

Indeed this possibility was 
raised by a confidant of Robert 
Kennedy, who had told Weisber g 
that Kennedy felt their wer e 
"guns" between himself and the 
White House. 

Responding to an inquiry about 
New Orleans District Attorney 
Jim Garrison's probe into the 
assassination, Weisberg stated 
that the only thing keeping Gar-
rison out of court are the stal-
ling tactics of the defendant, Clay 
Shaw. 

He went on to deplore the pic-
ture of Garrison that was being 
painted by the national press, 
anti to warn that an attempt on 

(Cont'd. on p. 3 col's . 2 &3) 
low those who wish to leave to 
do so, and to discuss the meaning 
of elections and law and order, 
in their morning classes. 

Atter the teach-in, there wUl 
be a cultural political happening 
in Balboa Park about 4 p.m., 
Involving the entire community. 

This teach-in is being held 
in an effort to understand the 
place of elections in directing 
and forming the way our society 
works, and to recognize the 
sources of the e mergence of law 
and order as the most irportant 
issue of our day. 

Reagan Won't 
Editor's Note: 

The following is the text of a letter sent to all the members of 
the Board of Regents, as well as the Chancellors of the UC campuses. 
The indented paragraph was sent to Governor Reagan on Tuesday 
by telegram. H e responded yesterday, stating that he would be 
glad to meet with student representatives, but not on state-wide 
television, since this , he felt, would not serve any purpose. 

The Regents of the University of California have been the target 
of criticism by both the students of the University and the Governor 
of the state. As the elected representatives of the students of the 
University of California, we are deeply concerned about thiS and 
other problems which now threaten the university. We also recog-
nize that conflicting and therefore confusing explanations of the 
causes of these problems have led to minunderstanding among both 
the students and the general public. With the hope of improving 
communications and clearing up some of the m!sunderstandingsbetween 
the unive rsity students and the people of California, we make the 
following proposal: 

The elected representatives of the students of the Unive rsity 
of California invite Governor Reagan to discuss, on state-wide 
television, "The Role of the Regents in the Administration 
of the Univer sity of CalIfornia. · The participants in this dis-
cussion would be: Mr. Charlie Palmer representing the Berkeley 
campus, Mr . steve Woodside from Davis, Mr. Ron Ridgle from 
the Irvine campus, Mr. Tom Shepard representing the San Diego 
campus, and Governor Reagan. This discussion should precede 
the November 22 Regent's meeting but would be at a place and 
time chosen by the Governor. 

We hope that the people of the state will join with us in encouraging 
Governor Reagan to accept our invitation in the hope that it will lead 
us all to a clear er understanding of a most important problem.

Profs Confront 
Students friday 

What has happened to that glor-
ltied ideal of the existence of 
communications and trust be· 
tween faculty and students? 

Soon atter the UCSD Academk 
nate passed its resolution con-

cer ning the Regent ' s action on 
Eldridge Cleaver, TNC issued 
a circular which included the 
statement that the r esolution "ef-
fectively breaks down whatever 
tr ust still remains between stu-
dents and the faculty." 

In order to explore this di-
lemna and possibly even amell-
orate the condition which TNC 
and other s in the academic com-
munity find so apparent, the 
Guest-In-Residence Committee 
is initiating a program encour-
aging the ve rbal confrontation be-
tween professor s and students. 

Beginning today. from 3 to 5 
p.m., and on subsequent Fridays 
throughout this year, the Beagle 
Hall Guest Apartment will be 
open for informal discussion and 
coHee with a member ofthe UCs[ 
faculty. 

Today' s "Friday Professor" 
is Dr. Walter Munk, Professor 
of Oceanography at Scripps and 
Chairman of the UCSD faculty. 
From 3 to 5 p.m., Dr. Monk 
will be in Beagle to discuss any-
thing from his research in ocean-
ography to the improve ment of 
cummunications between faculty 
and students . 

In addition, he has expressed 
a desire to discuss the charges 
brought against the faculty in the 
TNC circular. 

Next Fr iday, November-o, ,u 
"Friday Prof ssor" will 

Chancellor William McGUl. The 
Guest-In-Residence Committee. 
sponsor of this new weekly dis-
cussion series, is composed of 
UCSD students who are primarily 
responsible for bringing guest 
speakers on campus. 

Anyone interested in joining the 
committee, or in suggesting 
either guests or faculty mem-
bers, are encouraged to see Ann 
Conklin in the Re .. elle College 
Resident Dean's Office.

. Two weeks ago, in a guest editorial Mr. Herman Rumper presented 
his ' viewpoint that the upcoming election is not a meaningful one. 
and that those of us who can vote should abstain from doing so. Illi 
article pointed out quite well the various ways in which the demo· 
cratic system has broken down (If, in fact, it functioned perfectly) 
and the presidential election become a farce. 

However, with all due respect to Mr. Rumper, the decisions tc 
be made by the voter in this election are not Inslgnilicant ones, even 
though they 10ay be reduced to merely choosing between the lesser 
of two evils. In fact, in some cases, the diUerence between the can-
didates and the issues is quite dramatic. 

Those of us who have been lett with a deep bitterness and cyniCism 
from the events of this past election year must, upon a thoughfu) 
and rational r eflection, recognize that there are Important decisions 
to be made come election day, and that now is not the time to abdicate 
in frustrations, but to try to solidify whatever gains have been made, 
a.nd look to the future. The cry these days is "all power to the peo-
ple," but if we drop out now, the establishment machine will merely 
gain a tighter grip on us . 

Forgetting, for a moment , the Presidential election, let us con-
sider the decisions the California voter must make next Tuesday. 
In this day of " lesser evils," the closest we have to a positive good 
is Alan Cranston. 

His views on such foreign' po licy issues as Vietnam, Red China, 
and further U.S. involvement around the globe, show far more sanity 
than tbose ot his opponent, while his domestic views seem to exhibit 
s ome measure of understanding and compassion towards our inter-
nal problems. 

However, whether or not one Is impressed by Cranston, be can 
surely not help but be alarmed by the lrresponslble statements of 
Dr . Max Rafferty. This man constitutes a clear and present danger 
to the Univer s ity of California. His prescr iption for solving UC 
"problems" - withholding of funds from schools where protest demon-
strations occurred, and immediate expulsion of those involved -
would mark the beginning ot an era that would make the McCarthy 
days pale in comparison. 

His stand on the various Issues is typical of present-day politi-
cians who advocate simplistic solutions which attempt to eradicate 
the symptoms without attacking the roots of the problems. 

Aiso of vital interest to the University is the passage of Propo-
sition 3, which provides for additional funds for the UC system. 
Recent cutbacks in the budget (in the name of economy) by our illus-
trious governor have threatened tbe continued status of UC as a res-
pected institution. ot higher learning. 

These cutbacks have hit especially hard at the new campuses, 
UCSD included, which are in the developing stages. Proposition 
3 must be passed, If the UC system is to remain great. 

Closely related to the Reagan-Regents feud is the larger issue 
of which party w!11 gain control of the state legislature. Currently, 
the Democrats, led by Speaker Jesse Unruh, hold a slim margin, 
which is very much in jeopardy at the moment. A Republican-coo-
trolled legislature would mean virtually a free rein for the Governor 
in carrying out his programs. This prospect is certainly somethin@ 
for the vote r to think about.

As a subsCriber to your 'news-
paper and a neighbor to the Univ-
ersity, I wonder whether I might 
be permitted to contribute to your 
guest editorial page. 

We adult neighbors often shud-
der at the waves of protest which 
sometimes break aga.inst a heri-
tage which we consider precious. 
We find the hate and violence and 
misunderstanding fru strating and 
frightening. 

The turmoil seems to center 
about the concept of freedom 
which Is usually considered to 
be a s tate ot being. In reality, 
it is a procedure---a process 
for harmonizing with nature 
which entails its own discipline. 
Plants and animals which do not 
adapt to their surroundings, how-
ever harsh, simply dIe. Humans 
become confused and neurotic. 

Some of us here in La Jolla 
who care about your upbringin@ 
feel that the leadership of somE 
of your professors in guldini 
you toward true freedom leave~ 
something to be desired. 

There ~ i thought proces~ 
which must be followed in order 
to aChieve harmony with one's 
surroundings. This harmony is 
a pr erequisite to measuring one' s 
capacity for making social change 
beneficially. 

Enclosed are SlX newspaper 
length articles for your consid-
eration. Hopefully they may lead 
to wisdom. 

Good luck and God bless,

Editor, Triton Times: 
Certain statements appeared 

in tbe October .25. 1968 Issue 
of the Triton Times that were 
false and misleading. The arti-
cles on Cannabis sativa and Floyd 
Morrow both contained errors 
relating to Republican legisla-
tors. 

The former instance is espec-
laUy appaling since Mr. Davis 
failed at elementary reading as 
well as humor. 

Craig ( not Clalre ) Biddle 
authored the legislation to lower 
the penalty for the possession 
of marijuana from a felony to 
a misdemeanor. He has not ad-
vocated the lepslatlon of weed. 
Furthermore, the topic of his 
talk dealt with California's prob-
lems in general, especially as 
they relate to youth. 

Contrary to Mr. Easton'! 
statement, state Senator Jacli 
Schrade is not a member ot tIlE 
J obo Blrcb Society. Only one 
member of the California state 
Senate, John C. Scbmitz (R-Tus-
tin), is a Bircher. 

In any event, Floyd Morrow 
earns the title -reactionary· 
when be expressed the outdated 
view that crime is economical-
ly based. Perhaps he should try 
reading Daniel Moynihan rather 
than Eldridge Cleaver. 

UCSD Young Republicans 

Editor, the Times 
attention: Mr. Jeff Brittain 

In the October 25 issue of the 
Triton Times, under your by-
lined article. which is a report 
of the ASUCSD Senate meeting 
there is a sentence which reads: 

• At the meeting in Sinta Cruz 
one girl was actually suspended 
for attempting to address the 
Regents, but she was r einstated.· 

Admittedly. dillerent people 
wl1linterpret the sentence indif-
ferent ways. Perhaps, even much 
differently than you meant it. 
However, my interpretation dit-
fers so substantially from the 
description given by the Chan-
cellor at the Academic Senate 
meeting (at which Mr . Shepard 
was present) that I feel It is 
necessary to br ing it to your 
attention. 

In the interests of t£lr a.od iC-
curate reportlng,l thlnldt is your 
responslbUity to tind out about 
the related circumstances before 
writing such simplistic descrip-
tions of important events. U 
you have a.ny d1Uiculty in finding 
out what happened it the Ineet-
Ing in this rega.rd, I would be 
happy to do what I can to he Ip 
you get the necessary Inform-
ation. 

After you have appuised your-
seU of the details of the circum-
sta.nces, r look forwat'd to YOllr 
describing them In a future art-
icle together with whatever com-
mentary you feel appropriate. 

U ever the University needed 
tnforma.tion on the important e-
vents, it is now, but it had best 
be accurate a.nd fair.

With apologies to Hiawatha 

Ed itor's note: 
The following letter was writ-

ten to Dean Ward Beecher, by 
and Educatlon Abroard student 
in Goettingen, ~rmany. 

I am writing this letter to 
you as you requested. However, 
I a m at somewhat of a loss 
at what to write, for the fir st 
2 months bere in Goettingen have 
been so eventful I will attempt 
to convey some things which 
ma y be of use to future students. 

1) It is importa.nt that one 
learn quite a bit more grammar 
than Is r equired at UCSD. The 
intensive German Class consists 
of 10 hours a week ot grammar 
and it is quite obvious that the 
group from UCSD (myself in-
cluded) were lacking In theoret-
ical grammar. 

2) The intensive German 
course is not particularly hard, 
and to get B's requires very 
little extra time outside of class. 
Furthermore, it is a very pain-
le ss wa.y of increasing your Ger-
man ability, although quite 
damaging to your English. 

3) The !lving quuters that 
this year's UCSD students have 
are all very nice!! They range 
in price trom 65DM/ montb -
140DM/month_ It Is worth not-
Ing that the price has little to 
do with the quality (desirability) 
of the place one is staying. I, 
myself, find the Foram (Bruder-
Grimm - Aile 57) at 70 DM/ 
month to be one ot the nicest 
s tudent wohnbeims, whereas a 
fe llow UCSD paying 140 DM has 
a lot less conveniences, although 
he has a much bigger room'. 

I suggest that UCSD students 
attempt to get In the student 
Dorm, Siedlung or the Forum. 
The Forum only takes one stu-
dent out of the UC group each 
year, but I think they are the 
most fortunate ones to have come 
to Germany. One thing in gen-
eral about housing, they all ex-
ceed American dorms because 
they have kitchens and many more 
s ingle rooms. Furthermore 
there are very few rules, n~ 
vis itation limits on open doors 
but they do ask you to be qulei 
so that we can study. 

4) I would llke to warn phy· 
s ics majors that It appears tl 
be difficult to make normal pro· 
gress in the major toward gra-
duation. I am scared I will 
fall behind at least one quarter, 
most likely two. I, myself, hope 
to make It up by completing my 
mInor in German Literature. 

I would like to close this un-
orthodox leiter with i thank you 
to Dean Beecher tor one, the 
opportunity to come, a.nd two, 
for sparing me all the pessi-
mistic warnings which have 
pr oven quite unnecessary these 
firs t two beautiful months. 

Sincerely, 
Daniel Geor~

IA.S. Se~'!B!~ Notes I Man the Observe 
In a very short meeting Tuesday night the A.S. Senate considered 

several very Important Issues and problems. President Tom Shepard 
warned about the possibility of an adverse reaction by the Regents 
if there is any violence at the Novermber 22nd meeting here at 
UCSD. Several of the student organizations on campus have promised 
that they will not attempt any demonstrations that could lead to violence. 

The students must also be aware of the tact that the governor will 
attempt to bait the students into violent action. Such action will result 
In a political takeover of the University and Its eventual destruction. 

Shepard also told about the Invitation to Governor Reagan tor an 
)pen discussion about some of the problems ot UC. There seems 
ittle chance that our distingu ished gove rnor will accept. Howard 
Ceene, a San Diego T.V. newsman, has given the invitation and Its 
raml!ications his full support. 

The problem of where to hold the open part of the Regents ' meeting 
came up in an open discussion. There are several possibilities 
including the gym and the chancellor's conference room. Also entering 
into the discussion was the problem of whom to let into the meeting 
as far as s tudents from the local colleges or from other campuses of 
UC are concerned. President Shepard feels that it is highly important 
for all UCSD students to attend the open meeting and see just how the 
Regents , including Reagan and Raffe rty, move . 

The committee reports included such ite ms as: 
Quicks ilver Me ssenge r Service has conflrmed the November 22nd 

engagement. 
Theatro Campesino will be here in the near futur e. 

The portable stage, which will cost $1520, will be rented to various 
groups in a schedule ranging from $10 to $125. Senator Bill Eastma.n 
introduced a motion to cut these fees across the board but alter much 
after much debate, further discussion was tabled until the next meeting. 

Dean Topolovac Introduced a motion to obtain some money for 
architectural drawings of the proposed student center. The student 
center will possibly be paid for out ofa bond issue that will be presented 
to the voters on November 5th. Tbe motion was unanimously passed. 
This money will pay for 3 to 4 days of architect's work. 

Culinary Co-op news will be included each week in the AS Senate 
Notes in order to-keep the University Community abreas t of campus 
food service happenings. 

This week we are happy to see tbat the Revelle Cafeteria Is operating 
at full capacity with all four serving bays open for dinner operations 
a.nd that the North Revelle Dining Hall is now operating on Sunday 
from 11 a.m . to 4 p.m. as a snack bar in which meal tickets are 
welcome. 

We ask students to return any silverware and dishes whlth may have 
found their way out o! the cafeteria In the past weeks . The food 
s ervice manager John Lapetina welcome"S student suggestions dlrectly 
to him so that Immediate action can be taken. 

The Culinary Co-op meets every other week on Tuesdays a t 5 p.m. 
in Mr. Bill Borsari's office in Bldg. 412 starting this Tuesday, Nov. 5.

played in the assassination and 
the subsequent investlga.tion. Mr. 
Weisberg believes that the CIA 
was responsible for the murder, 
although it was not necessarily 
the head of the agency that or-
dered it done. 

He stated that although a coun-
try needs the services of an in-
telligence agency, it should be 
better organized, better controll-
ed, and not "into everything" 
like the CIA is now. 

He believes that the murder 
might have been committed by 
one department of the agency, 
and that that department used 
the subsequent confusion to cover 
its tracks. 

As to the FBI, Mr. Weisberg 
said that the worse thing that the 
agency did was to allow itse lf 
to be used by the Warren Com-
mission to build a case against 
Lee Harvey Oswald. He believes 
that evidence ga.thered by the FBI 
wasaimedat framing Oswald and 
covering up Its own ineptness 
and negligence. 

While, of course, the whole 
meeting was in essence a.nattack 
on the Warren Commission, Mr. 
Weisberg specIfically took It to 
task for several aspects ot its 
Investigation. 

One of his objections was that 
the publlclzed members of the 
commission were mere figure-
heads, and that most of what 
real work was done was com-
pleted by staff members. 

He bellevesthatfew Americans 
have any idea how the commission 
came to the conclusions that it 
did, and that therefore they mere-
ly accepted the opinions of the 
commission figu~~'d~. 

Mr. Weisberg also attacks the 

from Page 1) 
evi~nce of the commission, de-
clarmg that the "Warren Com-
miss ion redefined" the term 
"evidence". He believes that 
such evidence as the signed state-
ments of witnesses were tam-
pered with before they were sub-
mitted to the commission. 

Even the witnesses that were 
asked to appear, andtbeywere by 
no means sufficient, were not 
asked the right questions. Their 
testimony was used to frame 
Oswald and to refute the charges 
that there was a conspiracy to 
assassinate the President. 

One tlilal aspect of the lecture 
that deserves some consideration 
is the very atmosphere that was 
created by Mr. Weisberg. He 
stated that the controversy itself, 
at all levels of society, makes 
one "concerned about the in-
tegrity of our society." His con-
cern Is matched by many other 
people who are seriously looking 
into the assass ination and making 
requests of our government tha' 
continue to go unheeded. Mr 
Weisberg impresses one as : 
man who has resigned himself 1< 
bitter, cynical opposition, an op· 
position that continues to go un-
noticed by a sleeping nation. 

He is like a German of the 
late 1930's who has been criti-
cizing the Hlmmler Commis-
sion's inquiry into the Richstag 
fire of 1933. The populace feeds 
itseU on tbe lies of the nation's 
leaders, and supports the se lead-
ers in denouncing any criticism 
of the government's position. 

Whether tbese critics are right 
or not becomes unimportant, be-
cause neither the people nor their 
SQvernment Is willing to listen. 
Proof of whether Mr. Weisberg 
Is right or not Is just a matter 
of time, but it is unfortunate 
that the nation refuses to re-
examine the controvers y, and in 
so dolng examine the society 
that it has created. 

by Harry L. Smith 

Not long ago my daughter ar-
r ived home from junior high 
school and announced that any-
one who helieved in science could 
not possibly be \ieve in God. This, 
she Infor med me, was the pro-
nounce ment of her science teach-
er . Science dally discovers and 
explains phenomena formerly at-
t r ibuted to religious belief, the 
cliche continued, and would 
someday eliminate all the mys-
teries on which religion is based. 

This seems to be suchapreva-
lent attitude in scholastic circles 
that one wonders whether deep 
philosophy will ever be generally 
taught aga.in. It appears to be a 
r eaction aga.inst the many years 
that science suffered ridicule 
and scorn at the hands ot intel-
lectuals in past centuries. Now 
religion would suffer the same 
fate. 

Indeed, after lying dormant 
for many centuries the r enewed 
interest In science durlng the 
Renaissance met considerable 
opposition. It had been an age 
when men pondered more mys-
tical problems. They wondered, 
for instance, whether angels 
could go from place to place 
without passing through the in-
tervening space. Aquinas decreed 
they could not. 

Into this age of faith came the 
re vlved concept of a sphe r Ical 
world. U a man walked out ot 
his front door toward the east 
and traveled far enough in the 
same direction, he would even-
tually walk into his back door 
from the west, was the pro-
nouncement. 

While this inconceivable idea 
was being digested, Copernicus, 
Ga.lUeo, Kepler and Brahe all 
cooperated to remove the earth 
from the cente r of the universe 
and place it inconspicuously in a 
corner of the solar system. 

Some centur ies later other as -
tronomer s would shrink the solar 
s ystem itseU into Insignificance 
and lose it in a myr iad of galax-
Ies which in turn were converted 

. into pinpoints in the voids of 
outer space. Realizing that the 
cosmos had no center, modern 
astronomer s graciously placed 
man tbe observe r once again at 
the center of the univer se. Med-
Ieval theologians would have been 
pleased. 

I was but a child when one of 
my playmates asked me If an ex-
plosion in the wilderness with no 
one to hear it produced a noise. 
We also conjectured whether 
lightning without an obse rver 
produced light. Eplstomological 
argument sta rts at an early age. 
As I recall we concluded that 
thunder and lightning could wreak 
thelr havoc, but noise and light 
required an audience. We were 
wiser than we knew. We had in-
advertantly s tumbled onto the 
great dualism ofexistance . With-
out consciousness all form, func-
tion, and beauty los t their mean-
ing. 

This is also the ve rdict of 
modern science. Without an eye, 
an ear and a mind, the universe 
is a gray place indeed. R~d varies 
from blue by a few angstrom 
units, while only decibels dis-
tinguish the whining wind trom 
the pounding sur f. Solid matter 
is, It seems, mostlyemptyspac 
and requires a sens of touch 
to give it s ubs tance. 

Apparently our sense are most 
unreliable tletector s of reality. 

They substitute a fairyland 0 
color, harmony and function fOJ 
what is really a Jumble of im-
pulses and frequencies. Even th, 
very bodies which contain thes, 
prevaricating senses are com 
posed of nearly empty spacr 
filled with a ghostly outline 0 
vibrating molecules and spinninr 
atoms. 

As a phonograph gives mean· 
ing to wax impressions and as 
photographic projector turns cel-
uloid shadows into form, so rna 
interprets the physical unlvers· 
for the satisfaction of hlghe 
consciousness. Without man t 
observe and appreciate tbe beaut 
of his surroundings, the univers. 
would be a masterpiece withou' 
purpose, stor ed forever in ' 
lonely and abandoned gallery 

The keenest students of natuf( 
have observed tbe universe wit! 
wonder, humillty, piety,andwor-
ship. They include such men as 
Copernicus, Gallleo, Newton, 
Descartes, Pascal, Kepler , 
Fourier, Darwin and Einstein-
all men of deep religious con-
viction. 

Today we take for granted the 
revelations of the great scien-
tists, but it was not always so. 
Prejudice played as great a part 
in the physical sciences during 
the middle ages, as It does in the 
sociological science today. Con-
sidering some ot the incredIblE 
discoveries ot tbe time It is not 
surprising. 

Ear Iy in the scientific era 
came Galileo with the dubiouf 
claim that a small pellet and a 
canon ball fall at the same speed 
when dropped from the same 
height. 

In the year he died another was 
born who would make even more 
preposterous claims. The fami-
liar force of gravity, said Newton, 
not only made apples fall to the 
ground but reached far out into 
the heavens a.nd held the ponder-
ous pla.nets in their appointed 
orbits around the sun. The sun 
itseU, he asserted, gave forth a 
white light which in reality was 
composed of all the colors of 
the rainbow. 

Meanwhile Bacon made tbe un-
likely assertion that heat was a 

- form of motion, while Pascal 
insisted that air had weight. 

The basic elements are not 
earth, air, fire , and water, said 
Lavoisier. He and later Mende-
lyeev showed that the universe 
was composed of 92 building 
blocks, not changeable one into 
the other. This was especially 
true [or gold they told they told 
the disappointed and impover-
ished alchemists. 

Michael Faraday, taking upthe 
work started by Gilbert, made 
the unheard-ot assertion that by 
waving a wand of copper near a 
magnet he could produce a force 
similar to lightning and capable 
of performing many unlikely 
tasks. 

All through thi~ sclentlf:lc rev-
olution could be .Ieard the ridi-
cule and scorn of an incredulous 
world led by the political, ec-
clesiastical and educational au-
thorities of the day. At times 
their opposition became qUlte 
fierce. But the worst was yet to 
come 

Meanwhile geologists affirmed 
that the tops of mountains had 
at one time been at the bottom 
of the sea and that wind and rain 
would put th m there once again. 



Ghana Dancers Coming 
The Ghana Dance Ensem-

Ie , a troupe of 30 young Ghanian 
rUsts trained in the dance tra-

'itions of Ghana and neighboring 
ountries, will appear at 8: 00 

p. m. on Friday, November 8, in 
he Gymnasium at the University 

of California, San Diego. 

The ensemble, sponsored by 
the Arts Council of Ghana and the 
Institute of African studies, Uni-
versity of Ghana, Legon, was 
started in 1962 as an experiment 
in collaboration between a gov-
ernment department and a uni-
versity department. 

In establishing it, an attempt 
was made to create a school of 
dance where Ghanians could be 
trained professionally to perform 
not only the dances oftheir tribal 
areas but also those of other 
parts of Ghana; a school where 
Ghanaians could study musiC, 
dance and drama; an African 
school of dance which couldoUer 
opportunities for dance educa-
lion simUar in objectives to com-
parable schools abroad; and a 
school which would ensure con-

tinuity in the dance traditions of 
Ghana. 

The task of building up a nation-
al Dance Ensemble was ap-
proached as a creative experi-
ment. Its organizers tried not 
only to learn and teach the dances 
as they are done in the villages, 
but also to face the problem of 
presentation in tbe new context 
of the theater and to work out a 
form of presentation which high-
lights andclasslfiesthe essential 
forms of the dances without des-
troying their basic movements 
and styles, their emotional, spir-
itual or cultural values, or their 
vitality and vigor. 

The Ghana Dance Ensemble is 
accompanied by its director, the 
eminent musicologist, Professor 
J. H. Nketi.::. and by its artistic 
director, A. M. Opoku. 

The program is co-sponsored 
with the Intercampus Cultural 
Exchange Committee and the 
UCSD Black students' Council. 

Tickets for unreserved seatlng 
is $2.00, for UCSD students 
$1.00. '

Concentus 
Musicus 

by Paul Hamburg 

The UCSD Committee for Arts 
and Lectures presented the first 
in its Chamber Music Series 
Wednesday evening at Sherwood 
Hall with the Concentus Muslcus 
from Vienna performing a con-
cert of Baroque chamber music. 

In past years the Arts and 
Lectures Committee has built up 
a reputation for presenting su-
perb chamber ensembles and laSl 
Wednesday was no exception. 

The Concentus Musicus is an 

ensemble group of impeccable 
musicians thoroughly trained 
technicall y and musically. This 
Individual musicianship, in evi· 
dence throughout the entire pro-
gram was enhanced by the aware-
ne ss of the entire group tor the 
necessities of ensemble playing. 

The program opened with the 
Suite (Overture) in C major for 
two oboes, recorder, flauto tra-
verso, bassoon, strings and harp-
sichord by G. P. Telemann, a 
marvelous example of baroque 
program music. 

A maritime piece, the work 
was most likely written for some 
marine celebration. The entire 
work was an excellent example 
of the use by the Concentus 
Muslcus of original baroque In· 
struments, the earliest of which 
was a violin built In 1665. 

These baroque instruments had 
a sound qu Ite unlike those of 
modern instruments; the violin, 
for example, had a much sweeter 
tone and the flauto traverso had 
a much more delicate sound. 

Johann Sebastian Bach's Con-
certo for Harpsichord and 
Strings, BMV 1052, was probably 
the least successful of the work! 
performed. While the balance 
of the group's ensemble playing 
was always in evidence , the harp-
sichord soloist left something to 
be desired at least at severalcru-
cial moments in the first and 
third movements. 

It was at these climatic 
moments that the soloist make a 
sudden ritard, totally unneces-
sary in Bach's music as these 
moments are prepared for har-
monically. 

Following the intermission, the 
ensemble continued their perfor-
mance with the Concerto In G 
minor for strings and harpsi-
chord by Antonio Vivaldi. This 
work, the only one on the pro-
gram by an Italian Baroque com-
poser was a splendid contrast to 
the works of Telemann and J.S. 
Bach. 

The first movement contained 3 
delightful playoff between the tW( 
motives, the first spirited, the 
second somewhat reflected. The 
final movement was a baroque 
tour de force in the style of a 
mota perpetuo and was performed 
with great spirit and flair. 

The final scheduled work on the 
program was the Brandenburg 
Concerto No.5 in D major, BMV 
1050, for harpsichord, flautotra-
verso, violln, and s trings, one 
of Bach' s greatest masterpieces 
and the most successful work 
of the evening's program. All 
three soloists showed themselves 
as masterful musicians. 

This performance of the Bran-
denburg Fifth was unlike most 
performances frequently heard 
displaying great subtlety, deli-
cacy and balance. The mag-
nificent barpsichord cadenza in 
the first movement was master-
fully performed with great barp-
sichord style. 

The second movement was an 
intimate trio-sonata marked by 
de licate phrasing and florid harp-
sichord ornameniation. The fi-
nale was a dellghtfu 1 example of 
the baroque spirit. 

For an encore the Concentus 
Musicus pe rformed the Dadinerie 
tram the Overture (Suite) in B 
minor , BMV 1068, by Bach.

Fact or fantasy 
by Richard Harris 

A moist humid breeze sweeps 
across the vacant airport. Palm 
fronds ruffle back and forth on 
tbe edges of the runway. As the 
sedate atmosphere Is momen-
tarily shattered by the whine of 
the jet's warming-up engines, a 
toller in a nearby r ice paddy 
looks up from the verdent green 
rows of shoots. 

The sun heightens his already 
bronzed colored skln, while his 
two black eyes peer out of mere 
slits. Tbe Pan Am jet clipper 
DollV M. taxies to the end or'the 
runway and the worker returns 
to his paddy, bending over topull 
out the obnoxious weeds. Onboard 
the jet, Col. Joseph C. Marcus 
looks again at his watCh, and 
quickly re-sets his briefcase 
down on the floor of the cabin, 
under the seat. 

He pulls the seat be It snug, 
and feels the acceleration push 
him deep into the pidding on the 
seat as the fuel-laden 707 lifts 
off from the ground like a fat 
pellicano 

Col. Marcus is the last Ameri-
can representative of the mlUtary 
in Vietnam. As the huge jet's 
wheels rise off the ground, the 
United States is finally complete-
ly clear of the costly military 
involvement which began so many 
years ago. The jet climbs into 
the bright blue sky and disap-
pears. Mer, wisps of white con-
trail are all that remain of the 
Pan Am jet - and the U.S. com-
mitment. 

In downtown Saigon, the pedd-
lers push their carts from the 
market place on their way home. 
An old lady with a seamed, wrink-
led countenance reaches up and 
lowers the wicker curtain over 
the front of her stall. As the cur-
tain Is lowe red, the hand painted 
gourds and chopsticks slip from 
sight. A few Baby Ruth candy bar 
wrappers skitter down the gutter, 
caught in a gust of wind. A few 
people walk slowly to and fro 
along the tree lined, open boule-
v:j.rd. 

Highly colored painted signs 
with strange letters scrawled 
upon them dangle from second 
story windows. A mangy mongrel 
missing one hind leg hobbles 
along on its remainlng three be-
hlnd its master. As the pedi-
cycle approaches closer to the 

No matter 

center of town, an empty building 
comes lnto view. 

There is a sign visible just 
behind the strangely dormant 
bag pile In front. The sign reads, 
• HQ; Third Marine Command-
S. E . Sector." All the wlndows 
have their glass knocked out. 
Black stalns smudge the upper 
half ot one corner of the build-
ing. A couple of kids clamber up 
the sand bags playing 'king oUbe 
mountain'. They are quite naked 
and carefree. A woman, who is 
perhaps their mother, leans out 
of a second story window across 
the stree t and shouts something 
to them. 

The pedi-cab now s tops In 
front of the Grand Hotel du Ville. 
Getting out, a sense of the 
emptiness of the old, white-wash-
ed structure becomes apparent. 
The doorman runs up to take the 
bags . The only one In the spac-
ious, thickly carpeted lobby is 
the desk clerk. He give s out the 
key, and looks back down on his 
paper work. 

Looklng out from the fitth floor 
suite, the city of Saigon and the 
nation of Vietnam spread out be-
neath. A clear sunshine filters 
down into the winding streets and 
alley-ways, to the jungle paths, 
to the sampans plylng the still 
waters of the Delta rivers. Be-
low, sons clad in both black 
pajamas and South Vietnamese 
Army uniforms return to their 
homes. Their parents and fami-
lies can enjoy the blessings of 
togetherness once more. 

On a hill overlooking a vast, 
swampy jungle, a mutilated,land-
mined blackened huik of a U.S. 
Patton Tank bears mute testi-
mony to that which was, but most 
surely could never happen agaln. 
Empty helmets Htter a field lead-
ing up to the base of a mountaln. 
A hanging chin strap taps against 
the side of a hard hat with several 
bullet holes in it. Scorched earth 
bushes, and trees lend a sombe: 
flavor to the field of death. 

But that's all over with now, 
thank God. At last, at last. The 
burning hot sun coaxes a tender 
young green shoot up and out of 
the parched earth. It twists about 
to spread its frail leaf buds and 
catch the life-giving Ught of a 
new and uncertain future.

John Muir 
(Cont'd. from p. 1) 

Thus, agaln this year, the prob-
lem of formlng a college gov-
ernment must be faced. Dean 
Batchelder and Ken Patrick both 
have the power and skill to draw 
up and propose a constitution 
and/or by-laws for a Muir Col-
lege government, but neither is 
willing to act unilaterally. 

To create as broad as pos-
sible base of formers of the pro-
posed governmental by-laws, 
Dean Batchelder lntends to com-
municate with the Muir College 
community soon. 

The letter wlll describe the 
need for college government, out-
line the ways students and the 
faculty have independently ex-
pressed concern, and poll the 
wishes of the community con-
cernlng a joint meetlng - if it 
Is wanted , when, where, agenda, 
and other suggestions. 

The Dean wlll do just what the 
replies ask him to, provided he 
gets a significant number of re-
plies. 

The faculty in a meetlng Oc-
tober 15 expressed its desire for 
a community government and va· 
ted for the appolntment by stu-
dents, confirmed by faculty, of 
at least 5 faculty members to 
confer with students about the 
forming of such a government. 

Implicit In the Dean's letters 
and explicit in the faculty's ac-
tion Is the concept of a com-
munity government. This is the 
concept shared by Dean Batch-
elder, Provost Stewart, and many 
interested Muir students. 

Their basic premise is that 
we are members of Muir Col-
lege before we are students, 
faculty, or administrators, and 
thus the government of the col-
leete should be a joint effort of 
all members of the Muir com-
munity in an atmosphere of mu-
tual trust, respect, and respon-
sibility. 

A natural corollary is that a 
student government alone is un-
tenable and impractical. This Is 
not to say that separate govern-
ments for students and faculty 
should not exist, but they should 
be subgovernments , deallng only 
with their exclusive concerns . 

For example, the faculty gov-
ernment would concern itseU with 
tenure, TA's , renumeration, 
benefits, and technical aspects 
of teaching. 

Another group of students 
starts from the viewpoint of em-
phasizing the identity of people 
as students before members of 
Muir College. 

Judicial 
(Cont'd. from p. 1) 

be imposed by the law, not by 
the innuendos and lndlrect means 
01 the news media. 

The philosophical point to this 
discussion is the definition of 
what is private and what is public. 
The general feeling of the coun-
cil seemed to be that the uni-
versity should be an asylum for 
tree speech and that outside news 
media do not have the right to 
infringe on the privacy of the 
students because that media and 
those it serves ar.e not directly 
affected by this lntellectual In-
qulrr· 

The reporting and dlstortingof 
campus activities has serious 
consequences in the way that it 
affects the image of the Uni-
versity In the community. One 
example was noted In which a 
television staUon lnterviewed 
students off the plaza as 11 was 
supposed to but distorted these 
comments by showing them with 
unrelated films of student vio-
lence and dlsorde r. 

In the future, the plaza may be 
defilned as a private area where 
the Communications Board, 
working within a general frame-
work, wlll decide on the admit-
tance of certain news men. The 
university press and others that 
have a direct interest in devel-
opments here will be admitted, 
but the regular press will have 
to get its information by inter-
viewing students off the plaza. 
Cameras would have to be iden-
tified and the users carry a card 
from the Dean of Students. 

They , on tlY whole, believe 
in a much broaaer area of stu-
dent control and view the inter-
action of the power blocs of stu-
dents, faculty, and administra-
tors as the determining factor 
of the extent of student control. 
But the student bloc must be 
organized if it Is to have power. 

That organization is being at-
tempted by an ad hoc commit-
tee seeklng to gain student ap-
provallor a student BUI ofRights 
now being drawn up. The com-
mittee's meetings are open to 
all Muir College students every 
Tuesday at 6:30 In Chancellor's 
Conference Room B. 

Although this .conflict of phil-
osophy exists, Dean Batchelder 
emphasized that he views the role 
of administrator as that of im-
pie mentor, and that he wllllm-
plemeot the will of the majority 
of the students concerning their 
government.

Board 
Second, the Inter-Hall Judi-

cial Board was lnstituted a:; an 
alternative to discipline by the 
dean and was based on the as-
sumption that some rehabiUtaiion 
or education or change of the 
culprit is possible. The impor-
tant question arises as to whether 
or not the proceedings should be 
open to the public. 

Those for a closed session 
point out that the making of a 
transcript at the defendent's re-
quest, provided for in 
for a fair trial. They also say 
that observers in the courtroom 
ten to be unruly sometimes and 
to intimidate the witnesses and 
the justices, and that the uncer-
tainty of crowd sizes makes plan-
ning difficult. 

The questionable desirability 
of having the prosecutors per-
form for their pubUc as Is some-
times the case In public court 
was also noted. In general, the 
fairness of the trial should be 
lnherent in the board itself which 
is composed of both faculty and 
stUdents. 

Those for an open session 
In certain cases believe that it 
is the only way to achieve justice 
and that a transcript offers the 
listener no chance to react to the 
situation of the moment. Wit-
nesses and justices should be 
mindful of what they say and how 
they say it. 

Also, if the room of the trial 
will not accomodate all who wish 
to view the proceedings, the trial 
to a larger room. Provisions will 
be made for keeping order In 
the court too. 

As with the Free Speech pro-
posal, the amendment of the 
Inter-Hall Judicial Board's code 
was referred to a committee. 
The amendment will probably be 
to the effect that all hearings are 
open unless closed by the Judi-
cial Board's consideration with 
the defendant's concurrence or by 
the defendent's request.

Also on the ballot this year in California are two propositions 
dealing with property taxes , Propositions 9 and I-A. The editorial 
board of the Triton Times has not been able to research tbis matter 
to the full extent necessary, and recommends the extabliShment 
of a state-wide commission to explain the issues involved to the elec-
torate. 

Finally, there is the Presidential election. So much has already 
been said about this that it' s hardly worth commenting on. Certainly, 
the choice Is indeed a sorry one. However, the choice is there if 
you look hard enough. The general political philosophy of the three 
parties involved is and has been over the years quite different. On 
most of the major pieces of social legislation over the past decade 
you will find a general lining up along party lines in the Congress, 
with some defections. 

Furthermore, the individuals involved are themselves a major issue. 
Several statements made by the various candidates during the campaign 
and before, as well as the past records of these men, leave a grave 
question as to their qual1f1catlons for office. 

These questions are greater in some cases than others. 

So, come election day, the voters will have a choice. It may not 
be a choice that we should have to make, but It is indeed a choice; 
so, vote November 5.

CoII;s;on on Campus 
Editor's Note: 

This paper serves as an in-
troduction to the controversy 
surrounding Immanuel Velikov-
sky who will be the Guest-in 
Residence on November 12and 13. 
It is taken from a paper de-
livered in September 1967 by 
Mr. David Stove to the Aristo-
telian Society of Sydney Univer-
sity. 

by Dwid Stove 
Department of Philosophy, 

Sydney University ' 

The story of Velikovsky' s·the .. 
or y, its reception, and its su~ 
sequent confir mations , constit· 
utes one of the most fascinatin( 
chapters in the entire history 0] 
thought; and it Is one which u 
still unfolding. 

This paper can be no more 
than a sketch of a sketch of it. 
Those who Wlsb to know more 
can best begin by reading " The 
Velikovsky Affair", ed. A. de 
Grazla (London, Sidgwick and 
Jackson, 1966). 

A book called" Worlds in Col-
lision" was pubIJsbed In the U.S. 
In 1950. According to Its author, 
Venus as a planet is only some 
3,500 years old. The protoplanet 
an enormous comet In effect had 
or iginated, at some earlier time 
by disruption from Jupiter. ' 

It moved for centuries on a 
very eccentric orbit, and about 
1500 B.C. made its two closest 
approaches to the earth. During 
the 8th and 7th centuries B.C., 
the comet-Venus repeatedly ap-
proached Mars , and Mars In turn 
Iflenaced our planet. 

Venus Wreaks Havoc 
Only after all these encounter s' 

did Venus finally lose its last 
cometary character istics , and 
settle down to its pr esent plane-
tary behaviour. The effects of 
these encounters, esreclally the 
ear lier ones, on the earth, are 
portrayed as ' truly ca~astrophic . 

Oceans were displaced, conU- ' 
nents drowned, mOUlltalns built 
and demolished, orgmic popu-
lations extinguished, rivilic;a-
tions overwhelmed, .he diurnal 
motion interrupted, tbe month 
and year lengtbened, the aXIs of 
rotation changed-e tc ., etc. 

The author was one, Immanuel 
Velikovsky, a Russia 1 Jew born 
in 1895. He graduated in medicine 
in Moscow in 1921, and alter 
various other occupations and 
places of residence he was to be 
found practising psycho-analysis 
in Tel Aviv in the 'thirties. 

A book he prOjected on Freud's 
heroes was the unlikely germ of 
all his later work, for It led hlm 
to think about Moses and the 
Exodus. 

Now the Bible portrays the 
Exodus as taking place amid a 
series of extraordinary natural 
disasters; and expeclally when 
Velikovsky found an Egyptian 
document whlcb seemed to refer 
to the same events, he began to 
wonder whether the disasters 
might not have been real. 

Ten years later ,- " Worlds in 
Coll1slon' 'presented his evidence, 
accumulated from testimony, 
tradition, legend, and religions 
the world over, for the stor y of 
the birth of Venus as a planet 
after a period In which earth, 
sea and sky were convulsed. 

The next few years saw the 
publication of his " Earth in Up-
heaval" , which as sembles geo-
logical, palaeontological, and ar-
chaeological evidence for the 
same theor y; and of " Ages in 
Chaos" , Velikovsky's revised 
chronology of Egyptian history 
(which be needs to shorten by 
500 year !5). . • 

Catastrophism Reviyed : 
It does not need an expert in 

the history of geology to recog-
nize in Velikovsky's theory a 
revival of : 8th century catas-
trophism. It differs from most 
earlier. catastrophisms, how-
ever, m not attributing catas-
trophes to a supernatural agent· 
in attributing them to an extra~ 
terrestrial agent; and in suppos-
ing catastrophes to have occurred 
in historical times . There have 
been other theories, In this cen-
tury, of catastrophes due to a 
natural extra-terrestrial agent. 
But I am sure that no catas-
trophism has ever been developed 
with so much ingenu ity and com-
prehensiveness as by Vekikov-
sky. The range of subjects on 
which his theory has led him to 
novel suggestions is really al-
most incredible: from the chem-
istry of Mars's atmosphere to 
the original of the 'plumed ~r­
pent of Mexican mythology; from 
the nature of manna, to the cause 
of (the ending of) the quaternary 
ice age; fro m the origin o' 
species, to the identity ot thE 
Queen of Sheba; and so on, for-
pvpr . 

"Worlds in Collis lOn" quickly 
became a best-seller. Such abook 
has, of course, enormous appeal 
to what I call the " anti-fluoride 
be It" in modern societies. But 
it also quick ly became the tar-
get of nearly univer sal abuse 
and derision. The "Dallas News " 
thought it was a Russian propa-
ganda ploy. The "Dally Worker" 
saw in its popularity a sure sign 
of the dying days of bourgeois 
society. Well , one doesn't expect 
a great deal from the "Dallas 
News" ; or anything at all from a 
Communist newSjJaper. But what 
of that mighty ir.te llect, J . B. S. 

Haldane, in Britain? He thought 
that the book was an attempt 
by the U.S. warmongers to soften 
us up for the atomic war they 
were preparing to launch! 

Work Draws Criticism I 
The professional scientists" 

campaign against it began, well 
before the book appeared. Harlow 
Shapley, probably the best-known 
American astronomer alive to-
day, led an energetic attempt to 
stop the. publishers, MacMillan, 
proceedmg to publication of the 
book. He arranged for denuncia-
tions of the book, still before its 
appearance, by an astronomer, 
a geologist, and an archaeologist, 
in a learned journal. None of 
them had read the book. When it 
did appear, denunciatory reviews 
were arranged, again , in several 
instances, by professors who 
boasted of never baving read the 
book. Velikovsky was rigorously 
excluded from access to learned 
journals for his replies. Then 
Shapley and others really got 
busy on the old-boy circuit. They 
forced the sacking of the Senior 
Editor of MacMillan responsible 
for accepting the Velikovsky MS. 
(He had been with firm 25 years.) 
They forced the sacking of the 
director ot the famous Hayden 
Planetarium In New York, be-
cause be proposed to take VeJi-
kovsky seriously enough to mount 
a display about the theory. Then 
MacMillan representatives all 
over the country began to report 
that science professors in the 
universities were refusing to see 
them. MacMillan finally caved 
in, and prevailed on Vel!kovsky 
to let them transfer the Ir best-
selling property to a competitor, 
Doubleday, which, as it has no 
textbook division, is not sus-
ceptible to professorial black-
mail. The process thus begun 
still goes on. As late as 1964 
tbe " Bulletin of the Atomic Scien~ 
tists"-{hat famou s organ of the 
kind of scientific conscience of 
which the late Robert Oppenheim-

~r was the most adored repre-
?entatlve-h1red an ignorant 
Journalist to deride Velikovsky 
on his Egyptological expertise, 
and other matters equally atomic. 
Bu t Ve Iikovsky could not get 
space for a reply. 

All this belongs on the level of 
what the Russians call "admini-
strative measures". What of the 
intellectual level? Well, a great 
many "refutations" of Vellkov-
sky' s theory have appeared in 
print, some by very famous peop-
le, such as Donald Menzel of 
Harvard, and Cecilia Payne-Gap-
oschkin, also of Harvard, the 
autbor ot the we ll-knOwn astro-
nom lcal textbook. 1 cannot enter 
into any details of them here. 

(There is some detail in my 
artJcle in "Quadrant", Oct.-Nov. 
1964.) They are chlefiy remark-
able for dishonesty or incom-
petence. They misquote the text 
they are critiCising. They wil-
fully misrepresent the theory 
Velikovsky advanced. And they 
are replete with errors of fact 
and theory. But they are now of 
only historical interest, for they 
aimed to prove too much, far too 
mUCh; that a theory of this kind 
Is Impossible. Whereas It would, 
I am sure, now be generally ad-
mitted that a story like the one 
Velikovsky told cannot be ex-
cluded on ground of its conflict 
with any deeply-entrenched law 
or theory; for there is no such 
conflict. The theory is a local, 
historical one, and has to be as-
sessed as such. 

. What, then, of the positive evi-
dence for the tbeory? 

Predictions Borne Out 

As to the evidence assembled 
In Velikovsky's books--well, you 
must read them, and see for 
yourself what you think that great 
mass of evidence is :worth. For 
my part, the books convinced me 
of two things: that a thesis of 
extra-terrestrial catastrophes in 
historical times is at least a 
distinctly live option; and that in 
historical times Venus has done 
something peculiar, at any rate. 

But I must mention some ofthe 
more startling pieces of evidence 
that have come to light sinee 
Velikovsky publlshed. 

According to Velikovsky, there 
were tremendous electrical dis-
charges between the earth and the 
giant comet, and between the 
comet's head and tail. This, a-
mong othe r things, led him to 
ascribe an altogether novel im-
portance to electrical and mag-
netic forces In the solar system. 
You must rememberthatthiswas 
In 1 950-i.e " before the dawn of 
the space age; these were the good 
old days when inertia and gravi-
tation were still thought to be 
equal to every task (Plus only a 
little help from the sun's light-
pressure, to blow comet-tails the 
right way). Well, the wbole trend 
of discovery since tben has of 
course been Vellkovsky's way. 
He did not actually predict the 
Van Allen belts, but he said that 
the earth must have a magneto-
sphere much stronger, and ex-
tending much further into space, 
than anyone eise believed pos-
sible. He did predict that Jupiter 
would be found to be a radio 
source, long before the aston-
ished radio-astronomers found 
it so. And there is much more 
like that. 

According to Velikovslty, tbere 
were all over the world, as 
folk-lore alleges, rains of burn-
Ing pitch. This, among other 
things, led him to assert In 1950 
that the clouds of Venus must 
be very rich in petroleum gas. 
All contemporary knowledge of 
the chemistry of the planet's 
clouds was flatly against it. Yet 
it has turned out to be so. If you 
think this is a bit creepy, you 
have heard nothing yet. 

According to Velikovsky In ' 
1950, Venus must still be very 
hot, because olthe circumstances 
of its recent birth and subse-
quent career. The astronomers 
had long "known" that it was 
cool, and as late as 1959 ac-
cepted estimates of its tempera-
ture, such as 59 degrees C., 
were still being revised slightly 
downward. Yet it has turned out 
that the planet has a surface 
temperature around 800 degrees 
F.! 

This would be hard enough to' 
reconcile witb any "uniformi-
tarian" theory which requires a 
common origin for all the planets. 
But worse was to come. For 
Mariner n put It beyond doubt 
that the rotation of Venus is 
retrograde-that is , While it re-
volves in the same direction as 
that in which all the other planets . 
both revolve and rotate, it ro-
tates in the contrary sense! No 
doubt ad hoc amendments will be 
tried, to tit this fact into con-
ventional tbeorles of the origin 
of the planets (just as desperate 
ad hoc amendments to a "green-
house" theory are still being 
made to account for the tempera-
ture); but this one will test their 
ingenuity, that is certain. 

More Evidence 
Of things that have come to 

light since the de Grazia book 
was published, two deserve men-
tion, hqwever briefly. First, the 
fantastically turbulent and hot 
state of Jupiter--the enormous 
explosions It suffers, tbe changes 
in its speed of rotation, and a 
surface temperature perhaps'&'-
round 1,000 degrees F. (Remem-
ber your astronomical textbooks 
and all that ice, miles thick o~ 
Jupiter? We all ·knew· , ages ~go, 
how cold and dead Jupiter is.) 
Second, what appears to be a 
vestige 01 an earlier gravitational 
"lock" of the earth on Venus: 
for Venus is found to turn the 
same face to us at each inferior 
conjunction! (For references on 
these two matter:,see Yale Scien-
tific Magazine, XLI 7 April 
1967.) '" 

Raful . on Sports 

School Spirit, Yecch' 
by Larry Raful 

In case you didn't know, the 
UCSD football team has a game 
here tomorrow against Cal Wes-
tern. Do I care? Do you care? 
Does the faculty care? In fact, 
does anyone care? 

Well, I'll answer the first ques-
tion for you. Hell no, I don't 
care. Do you want to know why? 
I'll tell you why. 

I came to this school to get 
away from all that rah-rah stuff. 
I saw the Michigan state-Notre 
Dame football game on TV last 
weekend and obviously, the col-
lege football tradition of porn 
poms, cheerleaders, powerful 
football and hundred-piece bands 
still flourishes in the U.S. today. 

You couldn't get me near that 
stadium with those 70,000 people 
who were there to watch that 
game. 

ThIs school is above all that. 
I came here because we have so 
many Nobel prize-winning pro-
fessors, and because all I want 
to do is study during the week 
and drink on the weekends. Of 
course, if those guys want to 
get out and rack tbemselves play-
ing football, that's their bag. But 
I'm going to join the sds and 
really have fun. 

You say I'm crazy? Here' s 
more, lrom an athlete, yet. 
Manuel Myers, the UCSD first-
string halfback, told me that the 
number of fans doesn' t matter 

to the players once the game 
starts. 

So there you have It. Why 
should I go yell lor Coach Hack-
ett and his winless team? This 
school's educational philosophy 
doesn't include athletics-It's 
such a contradiction in terms. 

I will graduate a complete brain 
and go on to earn $100,000 a 
year. Let UCLA and Berkeley 
have the athletics; we'll take the 
education. 
•••••••••••••••• 

If you have read this far and 
would agree to anyone of these: 

1) What has been said so far is 
correct. 

2) The writer of this column 
really believes all this. 

3) I don't care what he thinks. 
4) It doesn't concern me. 

then you're in trouble. Return 
to -start·, do not pass "Go', 
do not collect $200. 

What I didn't tell you was that 
1 don't believe a word of this. 
What I also didn't tell you is 
tl!a.t Mr. Myers told me a crowd 
yelling in the home stands before 
the game is Invaluable to the 
football team 

And the third hung that Ididn't 
tell you is that Harvard is a 
better scbool than UCSD, but 
can manage to drum up uncon-
trollable amounts of spirit for 
games. 

Harriers Run Last in 
Invitational Chapman 

The UCSD cross country team 
came in last at the Chapman 
Inv itational Cross Country Meet 
held in Orange County last sat-
urday. 

It was, however, the team's 
first meet in the large college 
division, and the competition was · 
just too strong. 

Cal-state Long Beich won the 
meet with runners finishing first, 
third, fourth, fifth and seventh 

:for a team total of 20. Jay won 
the meet with a 20:55 time for ' 
the 4.0 mUe course. : 

Cal-state Fullerton came in 
second with a 67 team total, 
followed by Cal-state Los Ang-
eles with 89, San Fernando Val-
ley State with 101, Pepperdine 
witb 134 and UCSD with 146 . 

Despite the last place team 
score, Jay Sep! of UCSD tUnaed 
IIIID 

TrttOll IIUrler 
ODe m1le at tbe 
tational. Sep( was 
Tritorn to ftnisb. 

He received an award for fin-
ishing in the top 16. Randy Twom-
bly and Greg Nierengarten also 
showed marked improvement. 

The terrain was flatter than 
a billiard table, unlike the undu-
lating Triton home course, and 
most of the team made the trans-
ition to the faster pace reas-
onably well. 

Foot and leg ailments plagued 
Art Lujan and Mike Klayer dur-
ing the race, and kept promis-
Ing freshman Joe Gonzales out 
of the race entire Iy • . 

The time Interval between the-
first and fifth UCSD fInIshers 
was a d1sappolnting 3 1/2 min-
utes. Clearly more work Is 
needed in this area. 

Frequently a team which runs 
closely packed can sustain afas-
ter pace and higher morale, not 
to mention the psychological ef-
fect on opposing runners when 
passed by a cluster of the home 
team. All of these factor s and 
the short time interval itse If 
lead to an Improved teim score. 

By prior arrangement, UCSD 
lleId a dua.! meet with Southern 
california College during and 
within the Cbapman Invitational. 
TIle score was established by 
• comparison of times over the · 
4.0 mile course, since the two 
teams were in different divisions. 
Close margin of 26-29 giving 
the team a cumulative dual meet 
record of 4 wins and two losses 
tbis season. 

Tile next meet for the Triton 
llarriers Is tomorrow's Aztec 
invitational, hosted by San Diego . 
state. It w111 be run on their 
new 5.8 mile course eut of 
Murphy canyon road at 12 noon. 

RAFUL, CONT'D. 

Okay, okay. So you don't like 
football. How about water polo? 
The UCSD water polo team has 
a game here tomorrow after-
noon against Fresno State. 

The soccer team isplaylngCal 
state Long Beach in Long Beach, 
and the cross country team will 
be downtown In the Aztec invi-
tational. 

And what does this all lead up 
to? I want you to go to the 
football game Saturday. But 
that's only part of It. The Idea 
of school spirit doe s not stop 
at high-school graduation. 

No one is too good to refrain 
from yelling for the football team, 
or for that matter, for attending 
a performance by UCSD artists 
in one of their many excellent 
concerts. Don't tell me that 
rah-rah doesn't have a place 
here at UCSD 

And don't tell me it's no good 
because it's part of the Estab-
lishment, and that football is 
bad because it's like Mom, the 
flag, and apple pie. Well, what's 
wrong with all that? Nothing. 

If football Isn't your thing 
fine. But for God's sakes, d~ 
something for this campus. We 
need one thing here so badly 
and all the Nobel prizewinners 
In tne world are n't going to he Ip 
get that ingredient here; that one 
thing Is unity. 

We need to stop being separate 
parts in space, suspended and 
unable to cross otbers' paths. 

Break those chains , fellow 
, human beings. Start living. 

Enjoy, enjoy! For a start, go 
out Saturday at 1: 30 and watch 
the football game. 

I promise it will be better than 
studying or drinking. You can 
even yell a little, i! you want. 

r",s Week In Int,,,,,,,,., Sport. 
By Intramural Director Andy Sklef 

Intramural Football at the mid-
point finds the A League - BOI 
Bombers with a 3- 0 lead and Is 
s lated to finish with a perfect 
4- 0 for the season. 

BOI would have had a 5- 0 re-
cord il there had not been a 
disbandment in A League. With 
the Mark Butler to Bob PooI-
man combo, BOI Is going to be 
a tough contender for the All- ' 
Intramural Crown. 

In B-League we find the ever-
present 'Purple Gophers' psych-
Ing iis opponents and winning 
thel r way to a spot In the play-
oUs. 

'The Orange Tide' ofC-League 
leads with a 2-0 record, and 
with only 2 games remaining it 
looks like 'Pramge Tode' will 
be one of the top six. 

A correction in last week's 
won-lost record of the 'Dun 
Geeps' is in order. It appeared 
In last week's column that the 
'Dun Geeps' were 2-1. To date, 
the 'Dun Geeps' are 0-3. Sorry 
about that guys. 

Competition In the other fall 
activities, llsted in your Intra-
mural Handbook, will be under

THE INTERNATIONAL CEN-

'Nonviolent Action for Social 
Change' will be the topic of a 
lecture to be given this Wed-
nesday evening, Nov. 6, at UCSD 
by Dr. Hildegard Goss-Mayr. 

During the last six years, Dr. 
Goss-Mayr has been involved in 
Latin America, studying the ways 
in which nonviolent methods and 
attitudes might further revolu-
tionary change. She says, 'It 
became evident to us that pac-
ifism in a traditional sense meant 
nothing to these countries, where 
radical, structural changes have 
to take place in order to achieve 
justice for the poor. 

Therefore, the work t 0 be 
undertaken was to study how 
nonviolent revolution could be 
developed in a situation where 
revolution is aIready taking 
place.' 

Dr. Goss-Mayr, born in Vi-
enna in 1930, has become one 
of the most active and signi-
ficant partiCipants in the strug-
gle for nonviolent revolution in 
the modern world. Raised in 
the midst of Fascism, she ex-
perienced both the German and 
Russian occupation of her home-
land. 

Determined to devote her l1fe's 
energies to the struggle for jus-
tice and nonviolence, her studies 
led her toward doctorates in lang-
uages and philosophy from the 
Univers ity of Vienna. 

She then became a Travelling 
Secretary of the International 
Fellowship of Reconciliation, an 
organization which has attempted 
to explore the possib1l1ties of 
achieving political, religious, so-
cial and racial justice within the 
framework of nonviolence. 

Seeking to improve under-
standing and cooperation between 
Christians and Marxists, Dr. 
Goss- Mayr has organized and ta-
ken part in unprecedented con-
ferences in Western Europe, Po-
land, the Soviet Union. Yugo-
slavia, Hungary, and Czechos-
lovakia. 

Her lecture at UCSD w1ll 1x: 
he ld in room 2622 USB. The 
lecture is free and open to the 
public, and is co-sponsored by 
the religious communities of 
UCSD.

Riverside j.v. team. 

Perhaps the most exciting 
game of the season was the 6-5 
loss to the University of Red-
lands. In the fir st half, the 
Tritons showed how we 11 they 
an play. 

The offense was working well 
together, driving in well, and 
some great shots by King saw 
the Tritons leading at half time, 
4-1. 

Unfortunately, the offense 
couldn't maintain its aggressive-
ness in the second half, and the 
defense (which had also played 
a great first half) began to fade. 

Five straight Redlands' goals 
5pelled UCSD's doom, but the 
Tritons rallyed back for a goal 
that p t them back in the game 
and kept them there until time 
ran out. 

Hopefully, the team w1ll get 
:>0 track tor their final four 
games. Their next game w1ll 
be played here tomorrow against 
Fresno state at 2 p.m. 

All students from the UCSD 
campus are invited to a barbeque
