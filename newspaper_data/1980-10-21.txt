Soarer's 
budget 
slashed 

BY STEVE GOLDSTICK 
Getting high these days 

certainly costs a lot more 
than it used to, and spending 
more to get there than the 
budget allows can have its 
di sasterous effects . And 
nobody seems to know this 
better than Soaring Club 
President Debbie Stone. She 
and the club are upset with 
the way in which the 
Associated Students Budget 
Committee has handled their 
requests for funds this year. 

The AS will hold its budget 
hearings Wednes day to 
decide how to distribute the 
$25,000 alloted for clubs that 
requested a total of $80,000. 

Stone was hoping for but 
not expecting - about one-
tenth of her $5,400 request, 
but now worries that she 
may only get a fraction of 
that. 

"When we first went in to 
speak to the AS budget 
committee, they gave us the 
impression we would get the 
$500 we need ," she says, "but 
when we went into their 
appeal hearings last 
Wednesday, the committee 
treated us like we didn't even 
exist." 

The Soarinfi Club may be grounded soon if it does not 
receive it's fu budget request during Associated Students 
finance negotiations this week. 

Third Council raps 
reg fee alteration 
Joins Muir and Warren 

BY RANDY HILL 
Staff Writer 

The Third College Council 
joined Muir and Warren 
College Councils by voting to 
approve a resolution voicing 
"strong objection" to the 
proposed changes in the Reg 
Fee Committee. 

The resolution, addressed 
to Vice Chancellor Richard 
Armitage, expressed concern 
over his proposed elimination 
of the student Reg Fee chair 
position and proposed 
selection of student represen· 
tatives .. 

The council also attacked 
the method by which 
Armitage drafted the Reg Fee . 
proposal. Armitage wrote the 
proposal over the summer 
along with a group of student 
affairs administrators. 

Armitage proposes that the 
new committ ee be made upof 
five students, one faculty 
member , and two staff 
members. The Reg Fee 
Committee is currently 
composed of seven tudents 
and five faculty or staff 
members. 

Under the propo s ed 
changes, Armitage would 
personally appoint the five' 
members of the committee. 
Currently, each college 

council, the AS, and the 
Graduate Students Council 
chose a representative for the 
Committee. 

Renee Ragland, Third 
College Council chairperson, 
said that the council's major 
objections are to the "lack of 
student input" in the 
drafting of the proposal. 

"Armitage has to sit down 
with students on this," she 
said. Ragland also claimed 
that if Armitage were to 
personally s elect the 
members of the Committee, 
"it could reflect his own 
biases. ... The Students he 
picked would be more Iikelr 
to go along with his plans.' 

. GOV. IJucey 
in SD today 

Independent vice presi-
dential candidate Patrick 
Lucey will bring the 
National Unity Campaign 
to San Diego today. 

He will make a "major 
policy address" on 
Mexican-American rela-
tions at Southwestern 
College at 10:30 am. 

The AS budget appeal 
hearings are a last chance for 
clubs to present their argu-
ments as to why they should 
receive AS funding. 

Med school grant to aid health research 
Stone says the committee 

was 40 minutes late for its 
scheduled appointment and 
appeared to be quite 
disorganized when it 
convened. 

"It took a little while for me 
to find the other members of 
the committee," AS activity 
fee director Todd Thompson 
explains, "and I had to find 
them because I didn't want to 
explain the situation to the 
over again." 

Nevertheless, there still 
seemed to be a lack of 
communication between 
them, according to Stone. 

"Todd then gave us the 
impression that he couldn't 
even find our budget 
request," she says. "It felt 
like they were giving us the 
runaround." 

Thompson told Stone that 
because the Soaring Club is 
classified as a physical 
education organization, it 
would receive lower priority 
in getting funded. He also told 
her that it was AS Advisor 
Randy Woodard who made 
that judgement. 

But when Stone asked 
Woodard about the situation, 
she says he told her that

A three-year grant for 
$327,000 has been awarded to 
the UCSD School of Medicine 
by the Department of Health 
and Human Services to 
expand the school's curricu-
lum in occupational and 
enviornmental health. 

Joseph Stokes, IiI, M.D., 
professor of community 
medicine and director of the 
new Curriculum Develop-
ment in Environmental 
Health Program at UCSD, 
said that the grant will 
strengthen the school's 
required and elective courses 
in environmental health, 
help develop both a clerkship 
in occupational medicine and 
a visitin~ professorship 
program m environmental 
health, and help the 
development of a residency 
program in general prevent-
Ive medicine. It will also 
broaden the school's library 
of learning aids for 
environmental health and 
occupational medicine. 

"The purpose of the 
program is to improve the 
knowledge, skills and 
attitudes of medical students 
regarding environmental 
health and occupational 
medicine," Stokes said. "The 

Erratum 
In yesterday's edition of 'I'M Doily GfUlrditn., it was 

incorrectly stated that the International Center C~op 
Nunery would have to close if its enrollment did not 
ina-ease. . 

In fact, 44 children currently attend the nursery's 
morning session; it is the afternoon session, which has only 
fO\U" children, that may close if six more children are not 
found for it by Nov. 15. 
,. 

focus will be on the physical, 
chemical and biological 
hazards in the general 
environment, as well as the 
work place." .. 

The new program will also 
serve as an important link 
between UCSD and the 
developing School of Public 
Health at San Diego State 
University. The SDSU 
program in environmental 
health will be headed by Dr. 
Tee Guidotti, a graduate of 
UCSD School of Medicine. 

Ruth M. Heifetz, M.D., 
lecturer in the department of 
community medicine, will 
serve as co-director of the 
program and will be the 

person in its development. In 
recent years, she has worked 
to indentify toxins in 
working environments and to 
determine the health risk to . 
the individuals exposed. A 
primary interest for her has 
been the health hazards of 
the working woman. Heifetz 
has learned that many agents 
used in industry can cause 
disfunction to the female 
reproductive system. 

The grant will also involve 
cooperation with several 
other area facilities, 
including the Naval Regional 
Medical Center's Environ-
mental Health Service, the La 

Jolla Cancer Research 
Foundation, and the 
Southern California Kaiser-
Permanente Group in San 
Diego. 

The gran t will also support 
an on-going Environmental 
Health Discussion Group, 
who membership includes 
personnel of the Naval 
Regional Medical Center, the 
San Diego Department of 
Public Health, private 
consultants and members of 
the UCSD faculty. The group 
has recently been given 
continuing education credit 
and currently includes more 
than thirty members.

Today's Weather 



Middle class blacks 
aren't indifferent 
Just a white man's stereotype 
NEW YORK - They are shaJlow, callous, conspicuous 

consumers. They could care less about their poor rela~ives. 
They are not interested in the political process and d~hne to 
use their political clout. When they take a stand on ISSUes. 
they always look out for themselves and alienate potential 

~~ . 
This portrait of the black J!liddle c1ass.i~ getting in~reasmg 

attention in the mass media. In teleVISion, magazmes and 
newspapers, a deep divide has been drawn recently between 
the success of blacks who join the mainstream and those who 
still languish in poverty. 

At one time middle class blacks were viewed as a buffer 
between the biack poor and the white majority. Blacks who 
succeeded were held up as models for the poor to emulate. 

But white disiUusionment with the black middle class came 
to a head during last summer's Miami riots when it was 
realized that middle class blacks have little control over the 
black poor and make no impact on urban problems such as 
crime and unemplo~ent. 

In a recent artICle for the New York Ti1ffl!S Sunday 
mapzine white social scientist Carl Gershman blamed many 
of the ills' ot the black poor on "a new class of black political 
leaders and federally funded anti-poverty workers who 
became ... power brokers between the government and the 
black poor. These workers had a stake in preserving the 
underclass as a political base from which they could threaten 
- and extract concessions from - white society." 

A year aao. another Times magazine cover story lambasted 
the black middle class for its consumerism and suggested that 
successful blacks had more in common with the white middle 
class than with the black poor. 

The aJ'IUment that the objectives of the black middle class 
no Jonaier serve the interests of the black poor is usef~l for a 
broad variety of political groups, from neo-conservatJves to 
liberals. 

The change of heart has its motive in the fear of 
competition. Not only do middle class blacks compete for jobs 
with white, but the y also chaJlenge t.he political views of the 
white intellectual class, those who mfluence corporate and 
government policies. 

White intellectuals now converge in the belief that racism is 
no 10. a major issue. They cite the work of UCLA 
economist 11tomas SoweJl and University of Chicago 
socioIqrist William Julius Wilson, both blac\l, who argue t~at 
blacks have divided along two economic paths: one With 
mobility for the middle class, the other a dead-end future of 
menial jobs for the poor. ' 

Few "experts" have ever bothered to ask middle class 
blacks how they view themselves. Thus a recent poll of Block 
E"tnprise magazine readers (with a median income of 
$25,(00) is especially revealillf. The poll showed that three 
out of four respondents did not believe that "racism is less 
prevalent than It was a decade ago." And 95 percent said they 
believed that "whites harbor some form of racism towards 
blacks." They clearly have not joined whites in turning their 
backs on the issue of racism. 

Another common white criticism of middle class blacks is 
that they lack broad-ranging political interests and that the 
political positions they do take are self-serving. The Black 
Enterprise poll suggests otherwise. Nine out of 10 readers 
polled oppose high unemployment as a tradeoff to control 
inflation. Like the majority of their white counterparts. they 
express concern that America has lost its military superiority 
to the Soviet Union. But 58 percent believe that some of the 
money for defense should be channeled for social programs. 

One reason for this continued support of social programs is 
the finding that many members of the black middle class are 
barely removed from poverty themselves. Four out of lOof the 
m3$azine readers had a relative or family member on public 
assistance. A sim!lar studyof the black middle class published 
in 1979 in P~ych.ology Today found that 85 percent of the 
sample came from working class origins. and that only 15 
percent were second generation middle class. 

In other Black Enterprise findings, almost 77 percent 
favored a pull-out of American firms from South Africa and 85 
percent supported more black involvement in Africa 
liberation struggles. On the Middle East conflict, nearly a 
third of Black Enterprise readers sided with the Arabs, 8.4 
percent supported Israel, and 57.9 percent favored neither 
side. 

A majority said they understood the SALT II issues, felt 
they were affected by Watergate and overwhelmingly . 
opposed Presiden~ Ford s pardon of Richard Nixon. 

These studies suggest a very different reality for the black 
middle class than the one currently offered by the white 
intellectual mainstream. Middle class and working class 
blacks (the majority of whom vote) remain solidly 
commmitted to the politics of compassion that many white 
liberals have abandoned. They believe that social progress is 
possible, that government intervention is necessary to prod 
the free-enterprise system and that good relations with the 
Third World will eventually payoff for America. Many bla~ks 
have also decided that a redistribution of wealth is the only 
solution to economic inequity.

Nuke dumping targeted for 1985 
SAN FRANCISCO -

While controversy rages 
here and elsewhere ClVer 
the present dangers posed 
by low-level radioactive 
wastes dumped in the 
oceans more than a decade 
ago, some federal agencies 
are again pursuing 
research that could lead 
to a resumption of ocean 
dumping, this time 
including high -level 
wastes. 

At the top of the list of 
possibly sea-bound radio-
activeJ' unk are decommis-
sione naval nuclear 
submarine reactors. Sci-
ertce magazine reported 
recently that the US 
Navy has a research 
program aimed at finding 
suitable cx:an sites for old 
subs. By lIinking only two 
subs. the Navy would add 
more curies to the ocean 
depths than were put 
there during more than 
two decades of US 
dumping of radioactive 
waste, according to 

Sc~e. 
The Department of 

energy and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency 
are also exploring the 
"ocean opt ion" for 
radioactive waste. 

But earlier this month 
in San Francisco, con-
gressmen at a subcommi-
ttee hearing on past 
radioactive dumping 
urged caution in develop' 
ing future programs. 

Said Democratic Cali-
fornia Congressman Leon 
Panetta: " In the absence of 
the kind of information

Area journalist specializing 
in environmental issues. 
wrote this for the Pacific 
News Service. 

letter 

essential to making 
judgements in this area, 
the Congress should 
strongly oppose any 
further resumption of 
waste dumping in our 
ocean beds.' 

Panetta did not shut out 
the possibility of future 
dumpinf{ altogether, but 
he said It should not occur 
without a congressional 
commitment to monitor 
the dumpsites. 

J 

tIl it's un-
acceptable to 
bury wastes in 
somebody's 
backyard, then 
you have to look 
elsewhere' 

Os railure to monitor 
sites where low-level 
radioactive waste was 
dumped between 1946 and 
1970 carne under attack by 
congressmen at the San 
Francisco hearing. The 
subcommittee plans to 
hold a similar hearirig on 
the Atlantic coast, 
possibly earl~next year. 

The admittedly "prelim-
inary" tests EPA has done 
on the old sites, such as 
those near the Farallon 
Islands 50 miles from San 
Francisco, discovered 
corroded barrels leaking 
their radioactive contents . 
into the ocean sediments. 

EPA has been concerned 
about those barrels 
because it is required by 
law to develop site and 
packaging criteria for 
future ocean disposal. 

EPA hopes ~o have those 
criteria completed by 1985 

so that the government 
can begin processing 
applications to dispose of 
radioactive wastes in the 
ocean. 

Wendell Webber, who 
works on EPA's ocean 
dumping project, said that 
ocean dumping would 
probably not be economi-
cally feasible at this time. 
(The exCeption might be 
the Navy's nuclear 
submarine reactors, 
which would be much 
cheaper to dispose of at sea 
than on land, according to 
Science magazine.) 

But land sites for 
disposal of both high and 
low level waste have 
proved to be a hot issue: 
each state wants another 
state to handle its wastes. 

"If it's unacceptable to 
bury wastes in somebody's 
backyard, then you have to 
look elsewhere," said 
Webber. "We know we 
have a problem with low-
level waste. There are sig-
nificant amounts' of low-
wastes that have to be 
be disposed of." 

Disposal of low-level 
wastes, which include 
junk from clinics and 
research labs, appears to 
be the most immediate 
problem. . 

Past ocean dumping 
practices have left many 
officials doubtful about 
this method of disposal. 
Said Representative Toby 
Moffett (D.-Conn.) who 
chaired the San Francisco 
hearing: "The most 
obvious lesson we ('an 
draw from the history of 
the Farallones and other 
past dump sites - both in 
the ocean and on land - is

AS should withdraw 'poorly 
written' bill to remove Woodard 

Smce her appointment to the AS Council 
last spring, Marsha Vdovin has been a royal 
pain in the neck. Last Wednesday Marsha 
introduced a poorly written bill designed to 
remove AS Advisor Randy Woodard. She 
claims that he acts as an agent of the 
administration "to maintain a puppet student 
government." I can hardly believe someone 
would sugge t uch a move in light of the 
record Randy has had with the Council thus 
far . 

Randy Woodard has been advisor to the AS 
since 1977. and has been a valuable source of 
both direction and support. Randy is currently 
paid through Reg Fee funds. so t he AS Council 
would save no money by eliminating his 
position. His absence would also mean the loss 
of nnE' of the C()lInril'~ most valuable 

resources: experience. Randy has in the past 
successfully mediated the fierce debates 
among Council members. By nature the 
student government is a transient body, and 
Randy has served as a stable information 
source during these periods of transition. He 
has helped students to or~nize their current 
AS more than any other' administrator." 

It has been said that a candidate's record 
speaks for itself. If so, I hope this spri~ that 
you remember that Marsha Vdovin tried to 
1I1nanely legislate her personal philosophies 
into AS Council law - philosophies which fail 
to represent the best interests of UCSD 
students. Marsha, please stop wasting your 
time and the time of the other AS Council 
members. Withdraw your bill!

NEWS BRIEFS 

A decision concerning 
hostages is due soon 

BEIRUT,Lebanon -
The speaker of Iran ' s 
Parliament said yesterday it 
will decide in the "next two 
or three days" on conditions 
for release of the 52 US 
hostages and that he thinks it 
unlikely the Americans will 
be tried as spies. 

Iranian revolutionary 
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, meanwhile , 
agreed to allow a war 
mediation committee of 
Islamic heads of st~te to visit 
Iran , Tehran radio said. 

Khomeini stipulated the 
group was not to be confined 
to investigating the criminal 
invasion -hewasordered by 
Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein, according to the 
radio. But accep~ance of the 
delegation , even on a 
conditional basis, was seen as 
a small step toward solution 
of the four-week-old Iran-Iraq 
war at the head of the Persian 
gulf. 

In a telephone interview 
from Tehran with the 
Associated Press here, 
speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani 
said the war was not 
affecting the hostages, who 
have been held since Nov. 4, 

'. 

and that he thought the 
conditions for their release 
would be the same as those 
stated earlier by Khomeini . 

Last month Khomeini said 
the United States must 
return the late shah's wealth, 
cancel claims against Iran, 
release Iranian funds 
and guarantee non-interfer-
ence in Iran. He omitted an 
often-stated demand that the 
United States apologize for 
past ties with the late shah's 
regime. 

The Majlis, empowered by 
Khomeini to decide the fate of 
the hostages, will in the next 
few days announce its 
decision. Rafsanjani said. 

Although some hard line 
members of Parliament have 
called for spr trials for at 
least some 0 the hostages, 
the speaker said he though it 
would be "a very remote 
possibility." The militants 
who seized the U.S. Embassy 
in Tehran nearly a year ago 
called it a "spy nest and they 
threatened to try the 
hostages as spies." 

Asked if he though the 
hostages would be released, 
Rafsanjani said, "If America 
accepts our condi tions, yes."

De bate date is 
not yet set 

WASHINGTON -Nego-
tiators for President Carter 
and Ronald Reagan agreed 
yesterday on a format for a 
presidential debate but were 
unable to settle on date and 
place. It appeared that the 
differences were not likely to 
scuttle a debate. 

"We were willing to give 
them any date between Oct. 
28 and Nov. 3," said James 
Baker, a senior Reagan 
adviser. "They prefer the 
26th." 

But Baker said the 
differences could be resolved 
later yesterd~ in a telephone 
conference. The talks were 
held in the Washington 
offices of the League of 
Women Voters, the proposed 
sponsor of the debate. 

The debate could prove 
decisive in the closing days of 
the election campaign. The 
latest polls indicate that 
indicate tnat Carter and his 
Republican challenger are 
running very close in the 
large industrial states where 
elections usually are won or 
lost, with a large bloc of 
undecided voters.· 

Baker and two other 
Reagan advisers met with 
Carter campaign chairman 
Robert S. Strauss, White 
House press secretary Jody 
Powell and others for more 
than four hours, reaching 
agreement only on a debate 
format . 

The details of that were not 
disclosed. 

Nuke plant is 
quake-proof 

SAN LUIS OBISPO -
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
defended the earthquake-
safety of its Diablo Canyon 
nuclear power plant as the 
federal Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board opened a 
hearing on the issue here 
yesterday. 

The utility's reassurances 
were promptly challanged by 
opponents of the plant. 
including Byron Georgiou, 
legal affairs secretary to Gov. 
Edmund G_ Brown Jr. The 
plant is located 12 miles 
southwest of San Luis 
Obispo. 

The federal board held 
puNic hearings in September 
1979 on PG&E's requested 
license for the facility. The 
hearings were reopened on 

appeal to consider new 
earthquake data obtained 
from the Oct. 15, 1979 
earthquake in Imperial 
County. 

FBI incenses 
Huey Newton 

SAN FRANCISCO -
FBI "dirty tricks" nearly 
destroyed the Black Panther 
Party, "but I didn't expect 
anything more ... from the 
United States," says the 
party's co-founder. 

Huey Newton. the party's 
president, made the remarks 
yesterday after the disclosure 
of FBI documents showing 
the bureau used anonymous 
telephoile calls and forged 
letters and attempted to 
recruit black journalists as 
informants in efforts to 
discredit the party. 

The tactics "really 
damaged my character and 
the party to the extent of 
nearly destroying the party. 
It's not the national 
organization it once was. " 

The New York and Chicago 
FBI cifices tried to implicate 
Newton in 1970 as the person 
who "fingered" Angela 
Davia, wanted at that time in 
connection with a San Rafael 
courtroom shootout.

UCSD doctor will lead 
ascent of Mr. Everest 

An opportunity to visit the 
base camp ofthe first medical 
expedition which will climb 
to the summit of Mt. Everest, 
in 1981 , is now available for 
interested and physically 
qualified individuals. 

In the fall of 1981, the 
American Medical Research 
Expedition to Everest 
(AMREE) , headed by UCSD 
scientist John West, will 
climb to the summit of Mt. 
Everest in order to study 
heart and lung function 
during exposure to extreme 
oxygen deficiency . The 
scientific data the expedition 
will yield will lead to 
improvements in the care and 
treatment of patients 
suffering from severe 
respitory and cardiac disease. 

Simultaneously with the 
ascent. two treks are being 
planned for non ·mountail 
climbers who wish to visit 
the expedition's 18,()()()'foot 
base camp. • 

The 25 day treks will begin 
on Sept. 16 and Sept. 23, and 
will travel from the lush, 
subtropical Hindu hill 
villages of Nepal, to the high· 
altitude Buddhist, Khumbu 
Valley culture all within the 
majestic setting of Mt. 

, Everest. 
The extensi ve and 

vigorous 4,OOO·foot walk 
from the lowlands of the 
Kathmandu Valley to the 
height of the Everest base 
camp will be lead by Drs. 
Charles Houston and Gil 
Roberts, noted Himalayan 
explorers and researchers 
and will be under the 
direction of a Sirdar, or head 
Sherpa. Camp arrivals are 

scheduled to correspond with 
the medical expedition's 
summit asault. 

The strenuousness of the 
trek should not be under· 
estiated; trekkers do not need 
to be skilled climbers, but 
should be in excellent health. 

The land cost, not 
including air fare to 
DelhilKathmandu, is $2,100, 
this includes flights within 
Nepal . A portion of this 
amount will help finance 
AMREE . and is tax -
deductible. 

Dr. West is credited with 
the development of the 
equipmentwhich will be used 
to measure respiratory 

volumes, heart rate, and 
oxygen consumption all the 
way to the summit. He was a 
196().61 participant in the 
Hirnilayan SCIentific and 
Mountaineering Expedition 
lead by Sir Edmund Hillary, 
who also serves as AMREE 
advisor. 

West is an international 
authority on pulmonary and 
high altitude physiol~. He 
is joined in the expeditIon by 
a team of equally qualified 
medical researchers.

Presidential candidates sling' nlud 
eagan says arter 

may cause a war 
Carter assails Reagan's 
SALT negotiation stance 

CINCINNATI AP - Ronald 
Reagan said Monday the danger of 
"unwanted. inadvertent war" is far 
greater with President Carter in the 
White House than it would be under a 
new Republican administration. 

The GOP presidential nominee 
accused Carter of vacillation and 
weakness, and said those failings can 
lead to conflict. Reagan repeated that 
he wants to "rebuild our defense 
capability to the point that this 
oountry can keep the peace." 

Reagan pressed the war·and·peace 
. issue, with two former Republican 

secretaries of state joining his 
campaign entourage. 

Henry A. Kissinger, a target of 
Reagan criticism when he was at the 
State Department, supported the 
nominee's call for new arms control 
negotiations with the Soviet Union. 

Kissinger said he considers Carter's 
call for ratification of the SALT II 
treaty after the Nov. 4 election to be 
"A grandstand play - that doesn 't 
have a chance of succeeding." 

Former Secretary of State William 
P. Rogers said the war theme Carter 
has raised ~inst Reagan is "a 
phony issue,' But Rogers said it 
demands a response because "I think 
Carter has made some inroads in 
convincing people that Reagan is not 
interested In peace, and that's a 
faHacy." 

"Governor Reagan has made it clear 
that he wants to have sensible 
discussions with the Soviet Union 
about arms control," Rogers said. 
" .. . He is not a warmonger. His 
primary objectives as president of the 
United States will be to seek peace." 

The GOP nominee declared he 
wants new arms limitation talks, and 
would make clear that the United 
States "can and will compete if need 
be" with the Soviet Union In a buildup 
of strategic weapons. 

He took up the issue again at a 
Cincinnati airport rally staged by the 
Ohio Teamsters union, which has 
endorsed him. " ... The president of the 
United States seems to be determined 
to 'have me start a nuclear war," 
Reagan said. "Well, I'm just as 
determined that I'm not going to. 

"The matter of fact is, I think, that 
his foreign policy, his vacillation. his 
weakness, his allowing our allies 
throughout the world to no longer 
trust us or depend on us, and our 
adversaries to no longer respect us , 
there's far greater danger of that 
unwanted, inadvertent war through 
that kind of weak policy than there is 
by someone in there who believes that 
the first thing we should do is rebuild 
our defensive capabilities to the point 
that this country can keep the peace."

YOUNGSTOWN. Ohio AP -
President Carter accused Ronald 
Reagan of being "extraordinarily 
naive" Monday if he thinks the Soviet 
Union will agree to a nuclear arms 
reduction under the terms the 
Repu blican presidental nominee is 
offering. 

Reagan's proposals would mean a 
"devastating and perhaps fatal blow 
to the long·term process of nuclear 
arms control," Carter said. 

Carter commented to reporters less 
than 12 hours after Reagan went on 
nationwide television Sunday night , 
at a cost of $156,600 for a half·hour of 
air time. to reassure voters of his 
position on the "war and peace" issue 
that Carter is pressing against him 

Reagan opposes the pending SAL T 
IT treaty and says he would call for 
new talks on a SALT III treaty , while 
threatening the possibility of an arms 
race as an inducement to get the 
Soviets to bargain. 

"My goal is to begin arms 
reduction ,:' Reagan said in his 
television address. "My energies wi II 
be directed at reducing destructive 
nuclear weaponry in the world," 

But Carter had not even left the 
White House grounds on a campa~ 
trip through three key industnal 
states when he declared before 
reporters: "I am concerned that he 
(Reagan) does not understand the 

serious consequences of what he is 
proposing." 

Carter then began a trip to the 
Northeast that began with the steel-
producing areas of Pennsylvania and 
Ohio. . • 

At his first stop, in Beaver Fall~ , 
Pa ., Carter repeated the thrust of 
what he had said about nuclear arms 
before leaving Washington, but did 
not repeat his charge that Reagan was 
naive. 

In Washington, he said Reagan's 
proposals amount to throwing the 
existing SALT IT treaty "on the ash 
heap," threatening Russia with a 
nuclear arms race and "launching a 
quest for nuclear superiority." 

Finally, he said, Reagan makes 
"the naive assumption that the Soviet 
response to these steps will be to agree 
to new concessions and reductions in 
their nuclear arsenal," 

Imagine a speech by Soviet leader 
Leonid Brezhnev saying the same 
thing, Carter said. 

"How would I or any president of 
the United States respond to that? .. . 
The answer is obvious. 

"It is extraordinarily naive to 
expect that the Soviet Union would 
meekly accept what we would 
immediately and totally reject," the 
presi!ient declared.

Scripps Hospital to offer ' 
cancer information at UTe 

Taiwan exile tells 
of political struggle 

A Cancer Forum for the 
public - and particularly for 
those who might be fearful or 
unaware of new cancer 
treatments and cures - will 
be presented by three world-
renowned authorities, Oct. 
26, at 7:30 pm in Forum Hall 
of University Towne Centre. 

Sponsored without charge 
by the Saipps Memorial 
Hospital Foundation and 
Cancer Center, the forum 
will feature guest panelists, 
George P. Canellos, M.D., 
chief of medicine, Sidney 
Farber Cancer Institute and 
associate profess-or of 
medicine, Harvard Medical 
School; Stephen K. Carter, 
M.D., professor of medicine, 
Stanford University School 
of Medicine and director, 

Northern California Cancer . 
Program, and Eli Glatstein, 
M.D., chief, division of 
radiation therapy, National 
Cancer Institute, Bethesda, 
Maryland . 

Moderator for this forum, 
offered to the pu blic once 
each year, is John S . 
Trombold, M.D., director of 
the SMH-La Jolla Cancer 
Center. 

"Exciting new break-
throughs pertaining to breast 
cancer, particularly less 
radical surgical approaches 
will be discussed," he said. 

In addition, panelists will 
discuss advancements in the 
treatment of Hodgkin's 
disease, leukemia, ' certain 
types of lung cancer and 
testicular cancer. 

Because the major 
emphasis of this public forum 
is to educate the public and 
the cancer patient about 
treatment advances, a large 
portion of the evening will be 
'reserved for questions from 
the audience. 

The forum is an adjunct to 
the Fourth Annual Cancer 
Symposium sponsored by the 
Scripps Memorial Hospital 
Cancer Center for physicians 
throughout the country 

seekin~ the latest advance-
ments In treatment of cancer.

will present 37 scientific 

p~pers Oct. 27-29 at Vacation 
VIllage. 

Linda Shih, recently 
deported from Taiwan for her 
activity in what has come to 
be called the "democratic 
movement" there, will speak 
at a program Oct. 21 at 
UCSD. 

The pr~m will be open 
to the public; her topic will be 
"the goals and strategy of the 
Democratic Movement." 

Shih was arrested ' in 
Taiwan followi~ a demon-
tration in Klaosiung, 
Taiwan, that was called to 
commemorate UN Inter-
national Human Rights Day. 
Shih's husband, Shih Ming-
teh, was arrested at the same 
time. He has since been 
sentenced to life imp,rison-
ment for "sedition. ' The 
Shihs were active in the 
democratic movement and 

worked on its leading 
publication, Formosa 
magazine. 

Since her return to the US 
Shih has worked with other 
exiles in the US, Japan, 
Europe and Brazil and helps 
to publish Formosa 's 
successor Formosa Weekly in 
Los Angeles. In September, 
she conducted a hunger 
strike at Ronald Reagan's Los 
Angeles head-quarters in 
protest of his recent "Two 
China" statement calling for 
closer ties with the 
government of Taiwan. 

Shih will speak at 7:30 pm 
in USB 2622. 

The program is sponsored 
by the Asian-American 
Student Alliance and the 
Solidarity Committee. 

Court says Bailey didn't fairly represent Hearst 
SAN FRANCISCOAP-

Patricia Hearst Shaw gained 
a lep\ victory Monday in her 

:3to overturn a bank ro conviction, while a murt suaested the 
conduct of her famed defense 
attorney F. Lee Bailey be 
probed for possible disciplin-
ary _adion. 

Mrs. Shaw, the kidnapped 
newapaper heiress who was 
once the object of an 18-
month-long natiooal search. 
was reported vacationing in 
Loncfonand not immediately 

available for comment. 
The US 9th Court of 

Appeals told the lower courts 
"it may be adviseable" to 
investigate Bailey's conduct 
during his defense of Mrs. 
Shaw, in which the attorney 
negotiated the publication 
rignts to her story. 

There was no word on 
whether the lower district 

. oourt would lanch a probe, 
nor what penalties Bailey 
muld face. 

In makine its ruling, the 
appeals court also Slid Mrs. 

Shaw was entitled to a new 
hearing on her robbery 
conviction. A date for th.e 
hearing had not been set. 

Mrs. Shaw, then Miss 
Hearst, was convicted in the 
April 1974 robbery of a 
branch of the Hibernia Bank 
in San Francisco - a 

Sym~ionese Liberation Army 
crime which occurred after 
Miss Hearst had been 
kidnapped from her Berkeley 
home by the militant radical 
group. 

She served less than two 

years in prison and was 
released on Feb. I, 1979. after 
President Carter commuted 
her seven-year sentence. She 
later married Bernard Shaw, 
a San Francisco policeman. 

During her trial. she 
claimed the SLA had forced 
her to take part in the 
robbery. Mrs. ·Shaw, now 26, 
hopes to have the robbery 
judgment thrown out, 
eliminating her only 
conviction. 

She claimed Baily spent too 
much time negotiatillR rights 

to a book, which was pever 
published , instead of 
defending her. 

In a 16-page ruling, the 
appeals court told the lower 
federal distrct court to find 
out whether Bailey violated 
Mrs. Shaw's rights by failing 
to seek a continuance in her 
trial, by failing to try to shift 
the trial from San Francisco 
and by putting her on the 
witness stand. 

"Bailey's potential conflict 
of interest is virtually 
admitted."

Thompson had never 
consulted him ab.out the 
classification. 

Stone feels that Soaring 
Club is not at all a physical 
organization. In fact, she 
contends that the club 
provides a valuable service to 
the university by being a 
"watchdog" over its land at 
Torrey Pines, an area where 
the du b holds many of its 
activities. 

All of this wouldn't be so 
bad, says Stone if the AS 
didn't reschedule the club's 
budaet for the first five 
weSs. This means that the 
money the Soaring Club has 
counted on for fundraisers 
will have to wait until the AS 
gets itself organized, she 
sar.s. 

'This year we are on a 
severe budgeting restraint, 
and what they're doing is off 
campus and have fewer 
people involved,"Thompson 
says. "And because of these 
restraints, they are probably 
going to have to get most of 
their funds from another 
source because we don't have 
the resources this year." 

The Daily Guardian 

Nuclear wastes must 
be dumped somewhere 
continued from page 2 
programs for nuclear 
waste have been ill 
thought-out and their 
promise of eternal safety 
consistently exaggerat-
ed." 

Despite these concerns, 
some scientists are 
already looking beyond 
low-level waste disposal to 
high-level waste ocean 
dumping. 

The Department of 
Energy has a low-profile 
Sub-sea bed Disposal 
Program with a stated 
goal: demonstration of 
high-level disposal in the 
sea bed by the year 2000. 

The US Office of 
Technology Assessment's 
Willian Barnard said that 
the sub-sea bed option is 
more advanced in some 
ways than the land 
alternative for high-level 
waste disposal. The sub-
sea bed program, he told a 
Washinron conference, is 
"one 0 the most well-
managed government 
programs" because of its 
low funding level and lack 

of visibility. 
Sub-sea bed research, 

funded at more than $5 
million for fiscal year 
1980, gets only a fraction 
of the money spent on the 
land option for high-level 
waste disposal. 

But when the Inter-
agency Review Group 
included it in six waste 
disposal alternatives 
reported to President 
Carter 10 March, 1979, 
they said, "Five years of 
research have revealed no 
technological reason why 
further deyelopment of the 
sub-sea bed disposal 
option should be aban-
doned, but legal and 
political issues will need to 
be resolved." 

The US law and the 
London Convention, an 
international treaty, 
currently ban ocean 
dumping of high-level 
wastes, although several 
European nations dump 
low-level wastes in the 
seas.

Erratum 
In last Thursday's edition of The Daily Guardian, it was 

incorrectly stated that campus Legal Services, headed by 
Nick AguIar, could not assist students who were removed 
by force from last week's boycott of the chancellor's 
reception. 

In fact, AguIar can assist the students in preparation of 
their ca e against the univerity police, however, he cannot 
actually file a suit against the university. 

Black middle class 
continued from page 2 

In trying to avoid being u ed as pawns by the ideological left 
and right, blacks face tremendous difficulties as they attempt 
to develop strategies for advancement. Within the black 
community, some of the most interesting - and most ignored 
- intellectuals have begun to look outside the country for 
solutions to their problems. They see parallels between the 
under-development of the Third World and the 
underdevelopment of America 's Harlem. • 

Some believe an independent black economic base must be. 
developed again with the short-term intervention of 
government. Few believe that all the problems of the 
underclass will be solved by black capitalism. But they also 
understand that financially independent 1:Xack institutions 
could be powerful advocates of the black poor. 

Rather than reject all government programs, they would 
prefer to strengthen the ones that have worked , like Head 
Start and food stamps, and to develop new ones for specific 
needs. 

The relative powerlessness of the black middle clas is due 
largely to its small size and its almost non-existent economic 
clout. The impact of middle class black leaders in th 19605 
wa based on a consen us of white liberal support. The 
problem in the 19805 i for blacks to find ways of leveraging 
the majority when their former allies have gone to protect 
their own interest .
