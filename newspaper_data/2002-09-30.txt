UCSD is the seventh-best 
public university in the nation, 
according to a u.s. NrwJ & World 
Repon college survey in the publi-
cation's Sept. 23 issue. 

UC campuses at Berkeley, Los 
Angeles and D avis were ranked 
first, third and 11 th, respectively, 
in the public university rankings. 

When including private uni-
versities, UCSD ranks 31st, 
behind UC Berkeley at 20th and 
UCLA at 25th.

Administration 
revises policy and 

procedures manual 
A.S. angered by lack of 
input in PPM re,rision 
By LAURA McGANN 
Associate News Editor 

Controversy over the revi-
sion of the staff manual on stu-
dent maners has risen after the 
manual received changes while 
the majority of students were 
not on campus this summer. 

Policy and Procedure 
Manual 160-2, which governs 
access to student records and 
hearing procedures at UCSD, 
was revised by Director of 
Student Policy and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar this 
summer in response to revi-

sions made to the UC-wide stu-
dent records policy by the 
University of California Office 
of the President. Aguilar said 
he made the revisions to com-
ply with the UCOP. 

Members of the A.S. 
Council allege that Aguilar's 
revisions were unfair to stu-
dents because students were 
not informed that revisions 
were going to be made and 
because students were not 
included in the revision 
process.

Clarification ... 

IlCAS app'oints founding 
Clirector 

UCSD's Institute for International, 
Comparative and Area Studies named Miles 
Kahler the founding director for the newly 
established research institute. 

Kahler, an international relations scholar 
who also selVed as the Rohr Professor at 
UCSO's Graduate School of Intemational 
Relations and Pacific Studies, has extensively 
studied and written about international polit-
ical economy, repercussions of globalization 
and international relations of Pacific nations. 

IlCAS was created last year to examine 
international, comparative and cross-regional 
topics. The new institute will build upon 
UCSO's existing intemational studies pro-
gram by coordinating interdisciplinary and 
inter-departmental research while also hous-
ing the newlycreated undergraduate major in 
international studies. 

Kahler has been a senior fellow at the 
Council on Foreign Relations and sits on the 
editorial board for the journal International 
Organization. He is a founding member of 
the IRiPS faculty and came to UCSD in 1996. 

UCSD Professor elected 
fellow of Royal College 
The Royal College of Obstretricians and 

Gynecologists inducted UCSO professor 
Robert Resnik as an honorary fellow for his 
contributions to women's health, obstetrics 
and gynecology. 

Resnik, a professor of reproductive med-
icine and associate dean of admissions at 
the UCSD School of Medicine, is one of the 
10 fellows chosen from around the world by 
the Royal College. He attended a ceremony 
and dinner in London, where he was pre-
sented with the award. 

While on faculty at UCSO, Resnik selVed 
as chair of the Department of Reproductive 
Medicine from 1983 to 1992. He currently 
selVes as president-elect of American 
Gynelogical Club and is a former president 
of the Perinatal Research Society. 

In the Sept 24 issue of the Guardian, the artide titled ·San Diego CEO creates a new 
way for students to pay for college" quoted Lindows.com CEO Michael Robertson as say-
ing "I'm paying $25 to every student that beats me on the Chancellor's fun run." He is 
actually donating $25 to the Undergraduate Scholarship Fund for each student that beats 
him in the race.

"It is extremely inappropriate for the 
administration to make such large changes 
without consulting the students," said A.S. 
President J enn Brown. 

Members of Associated Students claim 
that by making the revisions during the 
summer and failing to include student . 
input, Aguilar was trying to keep students in 
the dark. However, Aguilar argues that his 
actions were not designed to usurp power 
from students. 

The reason for the revisions taking place 
this summer had to do with the timing of 
the UCOP revisions, according to Aguilar. 

"The UC policy on student records was 
revised in April- last spring - and it liter-
ally took me from April to June," Aguilar 
said. 

Aguilar also said that he did not include 
students in the process of revising the man-
ual because of the technical knowledge 
needed to revise it. 

"This particular PPM is very technical ... 
it requires legal expertise in reading of reg-
ulations," Aguilar said.

Pharmacy: Cloaking ceremony kicks off year 
continued fyom paRe I 

school. The ceremony was adopted 
from ~ similar ceremony performed 
at the UCSD medical school. 

Atkinson sa id the addition of 
tht: new school of pharmacy at rhe 
San Diego campus was an appro-
priate move, noting the lack of a 
pharmacy school in the San Diego 
area, rhe high rate of biorech 
industries in the region and the 
shorr supply of qualified pharma-
cy technicians. 

"It 's clear California needs a 
new school of pharmacy," Atkinson 
raid the audience of students, pro-
fessors and other attendees. 

Students were praised by 
Chancellor Robert Dynes for being 
the pioneering class at the new 
school, which is only the second 
public school of pharmacy in the 
state of California. 

Dynes said afterward that 
because the future of heal th care is 
a partnership between physicians 
and pharmacists, having the school 
of pharmacy be a sister school to 
the school of medicine is ideal. 

"If you look at the nature of 
medicine in the 21st century, the 
pharmaceutical plan is going to 
have to be in collaboration with the 
medical sciences," he said. 

Dynes al 0 believes that the new 
school will help fuel the growth of 
San Diego's pharmaceutical industry. 

"The school of pharmacy will 
act like an engine, just like the 
school of engineering has acted like 
an engine for many of the other 
companies," he sa id. 

Mary Anne Koda-Kimble, dean 
of the top-rated UCSF School of 
Pharmacy, welcomed the new stu-
dents as colleagues and wished 
them success. 

UCSD's campus has played host 
to pharmacy students since 1975, 

when UCSF's School of Pharmacy 
began sending fourth-year students 
to San campus for clinical training. 
The program will continue, with 
the fourth-year UCSF students act-
ing as mentors to the first-year 
UCSD students. 

The new school of pharmacy 
offers a four-year program to 
receive a doctor of pharmacy 
degree. The school is also develop-
ing a seven-year B.S. in chemistry 
and doctor of pharmacy program, 
as well as a joint Ph.D./doctor of

are anticipated to start, at the earli-
est, in the fall of 2005. 

Palmer Taylor, who served as 
chair of the department of pharma-
coIOb'Y, was selected to serve as 
founding dean of the new UCSD 
School of Pharmacy and 
Pharmaceutical Sciences this past 
week. He believes that starting the 
school anew allows it to anticipate 
upcoming changes in the field of 
pharmacy. 

") think we have an advantage 
over other schools in that there's no 
legacy in the curriculum or faculty, 
so what we can do is develop a cur-
riculum about what we think that 
21st century community pharmacy 
will be," he said. 

Outside of developing a curricu-
I urn, the school will need to devel-

op a faculty and build a faciliry. 
"I think the biggest challenge 

will be developing a first-rate facul-
ty, developing facilities for the edu-
cation purpose that can match the 
goal of the school," Taylor said. 

Tentative plans to build a school 
of pharmacy building on the med-
ical school campus are set for 2005. 

The 25 students of the class of 
2006 were selected from a pool of 
480 applicants. The students hold 
degrees from various institutions, 
including UC Berkeley, UCLA, 
California State University 
Northridge and California State 
University Domingcz Hills 
among others. Six students are 
UCSD alumni. 

Joseph Ennesser, a first-year at 
the new school, chose UCSD 
because of the opportunity and the 
small class size. 

"It's very exciting," he said. 
"And I think a unique opportunity 
because being a brand-new school, 
there's no set curriculum." 

Ennesser also looks forward to 
the courses, which are designed to 
anticipate the skills pharmacists 
will need in the future. 

"A lot of our courses are 
designed based on the future of 
pharmacy, the way things are 
changing," he said. 

Susan Vee, who graduated from 
UCSD in 2001, decided to come 
back to her alma mater for graduate 
studies at the new school. 

"It's a very exciting place to be 
and an exciting place to start a 
pharmacy school," she said. 

Vee chose UCSD for graduate 
study because ot' the chance to be a 
parr'of the new school. 

"We will get to set the founda-
tion for the classes to come," she 
said. "There are just many, many 
opportunities and that just comes 
with being the first class."

A STRATEGY FOR 
Bush's policy of preemptive strikes is 

the best way to protect Americans 
By CLA[RE J. VANNETTE 

Opinion Editor 

On ept. 20, President George W. Bush 
sent his plan for the United States' national 
security strnegy to Congress. T he plan , for 
some reason , is sparki ng an entirely unjusti-
fied furor. 

The paper is long, detailed and covers a 
wide variety of topics relating to U.S. foreign 
policy. What is at issue appears to be section 
fi ve, which is titled "Prevent[ingJ Our 
Enemies from Threate.ning Us, 
Our All ies and Our Friends with 

ry to protect its ciri7.ens. Why does it make 
sense to have a fo reign policy that dictates 
that the president must stand by and wait 
for Americans to die before he ca n act 
against agrcssors' 

Ano th er maj or justification for a 
defense-only military and foreign policy 
strategy is that merely the threat of an 
attack should be enough to deter most 
nations, whose rulers are obviously as con-
cerned about protecting their citizens as 
would be the American president. However, 

this is clearly not the case with 
countries and organizations 

Weapons of Mass Destructon," 
[n th is section, Bush 

describes the changing nature 
of international conflict -
specifica ll y, the ways th at 
threats against the United 
States have changed after the 

PRO 
whose citizens are themselves 
willing to die in order to pursue 
their mindless desire to kill 
Americans. Anyone who is will-
ing to commit suicide to kill 
their enemy is not going to be 

Cold War and after Sept. 11 . It's 
well known that we are no longer threat-
ened by otller superpowers, but by terrorists 
and rogue states, so why is it so shocking 
that our threat-response plan would change 
as well ' 

What 's ruffling so many feathers is Bush's 
un urprisi ng move away from the antiquated 
policy of acting in defense only, and toward 
a more proactive, preemptive foreign policy. 
This policy is entirely in line with the reali-
ty of potential attacks that face us. 

A; we saw on Sept. II, if we give terror-
i;t\ the opportunity to ~ t fl ke fi rst, thousands 
of innocent civilian lives could he lost. [f the 
government receives reIJable intell igence 
that a terrorist agency, a nation which sup-
ports tcr rori til llr a rogue state is prepared 
to make an imminent attack against our 
country, our government has a responsibili-

impressed by the threat of retri -
bution; they must be dealt with 

before they can cause harm to Americans 
and their allies. 

Furthermore, publicly announcing that 
we are willing to make preemptive strikes 
against agents that threaten us shows both 
our enemies and allies that we mean business, 
and will not tolerate waffling or noncompli-
ance. 

Critics of the new strategy are afraid that 
this policy will turn the United States into a 
bull in the global china shop, wantOnly 
attacking any nation that upsets us, whether 
we are legitimately provoked or not. This is 
hardly reasonable. Clearly, the Bush adlninis-
tration is full of mil itary experts who are well 
aware of lhe dangers inherent in undert:lking 
any sort of aggressive acti on, and would not

LETTERS TO 
THE EDITOR 

Editors perpetuate 
negative stereotypes 

Editor: 
I am writing to express my out-

rage at the gross inaccuracy and 
misleading nature of a title selected 
by the editors of the Guardian for 
Parisa Baharian's article, "An 
odyssey through Iran," which 
appeared in the Sept. 24 issue. [The 
headline for her article's jump on 
page B3 was "Odyssey: Student 
experiences anti-American senti-
ments ." Jlndeed, this title makes me 
wonder whether the editors both-
ered to carefully read the piece. 

The article makes it abundantly 
clear that during my stay in Iran, I 
did not experience hostility directed 
at me for being an American. Quite 
the contrary; Iranians went to great 
lengths to ensure my comfort and 
well -being - even as President 
George W. Bush issued a not-so-
veiled threat against the country's 
clerical authorities. Therefore, for 
the GIIO/'dian to characterize my 
summer in Iran as one of experienc-
ing "anti-American sentiments" was 
both irresponsible and insulting to 
the nl3ny Iranians whose hospitality 
made my trip so enjoyable. 

While the zeal with which Iran is 
often associated with anti-
Americanism extends far beyond the 
pages of the Guardian, what is most 
disappointing is that it continues at 
our university, a place which by def-
inition should allow us the opportu-
nity to question received stereotypes 
and attempt to understand other 
cultures. Even a cursory look at 
recent events in Iran - such as the

'Bumfights' video not illegal 
Subject matter may be offensive, but is pennissible 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Bums are entertaining. Fights 
are entertaining. Therefore, 
bums getting in fights must be 
entertaining. At least, that's the 
logic behind the new reality 
movie "Bumfights." 

Capitalizing on the success 
of MTV's hit series "Jackass," 
"Bum fights" takes to the streets 
and shows homeless men get-
ting into real fights with each 
other and doing stunts, such as 
lighting each other's hair on fire 
and running head-first into 
walls and fast-food drive-thru 
menus. 

Lately, however, the argu-
ment over the video has focused 
less on its entertainment value 
and more on the criminal case 
that now surrounds it. The 
group of four filmmakers that 
created "Bumfights" was 
arraigned in EI Cajon Superior 
Court this month on charges of 
soliciting a felony act. 

Unfortunately for the district 
anorney involved, these charges 
are legally unfounded . The pros-
ecutor is arguing that by paying 
men to commit assault, which is a 
felony, the creators of the video 
were committing a crime. The 
only crime really being commit-
ted here is the district attorney 
twisting the law to lead a moral 
crusade against something that 
he doesn't agree with. 

If paying men to commit 
assault is a crime, then why aren't 
Don King and the heads ofHBO 
and Showtime all in jail? Well , 
according to prosecuting attor-
ney Curtis Ross, boxing is differ-

ent from this streetfighting 
because there arc rules, referees 
and a medical staff on hand . Does 
that mean that if the filmmakers 
had instructed their backstreet 
brawlers not to kill each other 
and had a medical student 
enforce that rule, then there 
wouldn't be any charges filed) 
Highly doubtful. 

What is really at issue here is 
that the authorities believe that 
the "Bumfights" filmmakers 
were exploiting the homeless 
people involved. It's easy to see 
why the bums were taken advan-
tage of since they got a free meal,

extra cash and, in some cases, 
alcohol to willingly participate in 
a film. 

Ah, but if the filmmakers 
promised alcohol to a homeless 
alcoholic, then that would cer-
tainly be taking advantage of 
him. It's hard to argue that point, 
but is it really any different from 
a "respectable" filmmaker paying 
an alcoholic stuntman to do a 
dangerous stunt that nobody else 
would do? To my knowledge, 
there have been no charges filed 
::;ainst any producers, directors 
or stunt coordinators lately. 

The bottom line here is that 
this is, or at least should be, a 
freedom of speech issue. These 
four men should he allowed to 
film whatever they want within 
the constraints of the law. It 
should be clear that the 
"Bumfights" video fits within 
that parameter. These were will-
ing actors in a bad film that will 
unfortunately skyrocket to No. I 
on the trailer-trash rap I a list. 
That does not make it illegal. 
These men are not legally oblig-
ated to get a full mental evalua-
tion and clean bill of sobriety 
from actors before allowing them 
to be in the film . 

If anyone should be to blame 
in this mess it should be our 
society. Didn't anyone see this 
coming from the long line of 
"rea[ity" television shows like 
"Real World" and "Jackass'" 
There is even going to be an 
"American Candidate" show on

election. Enough is enour;h. In

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

The pressing issue of feminism cannot be neglected 
Things improved, but gender .. based·discrimination is still pervasive 

By JESSICA L1NGEL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

There is a very unforrunate ten-
dency within American culture to 
take a h t issue of the moment. 
parJde It around and debate it for a 
while. and then abandon it. We pick 
a cause, find a problem and address 
it. For a while. And then it 's dis-
carded, swept aside and ignored to 
make way for a new issue to "solve." 

We did it to racial profiling. 
We did it to AIDS and other exu-
all y transmitted diseases. We did it 
to universal health care (or the 
lack thereof). We did it to the sep-
aration of church and state. We've 
1110St certainly done it to gun con-
trol. It's I ike we have this crazy 
belief that if we glance at as many 
problems as possible, even if it's 
JUSt for the slightes t amount of 
ome, then we've done our duty 
and done our best to answer what-

eller crisis was 
brought to our 
attention. 

In reality, we 
don't solve any-
thing, and in fac t 
the problem 
becomes worse 

\ 
rights to privacy 
(that is, terrorism 
side effects) come to 
mind . Yet, gender-
based discrimina-
tion is still a huge 
problem. 

Dis c l ai mer : 
beca use we fee I 
like there's noth-
ing more to be 
done. But really, 
the problem is still 
there - its just no 
longer discussed. 
Perhaps one of the 
most mind-reeling 

NATIONAL 

Things are better 
now than they have 
ever been. Women 
are freer than they 
have ever been. We 
can vote, go to 
school and have 
jobs. Three cheers 
for that. \Vay to go, 

issues that we've left neglected for 
entirely too long is sexism. 

Sexism JUSt isn 't an issue any-
more. Feminism has apparently 
had a bit more than its 15 minutes 
and has been shoved aside to make 
way for other things - campaign 
finance issues (read: Enron) and 

America. There's clearly no gender-
based opposition here. Yeah, right. 

Women are still stereotyped. 
We are still victimized by jokes 
and labels. It's just that we don't 
rea lly talk about it anymore. 
Within the context of modern 
society, sexist stereotypes are 

everywhere. Everything a woman 
does marks her. Every action cre-
ates an opportunity for judgment. 
If she wears makeup, she's taking 
advantage of her sexuali ty. If she 
doesn't, then she's making a state-
ment about political beliefs. If she 
likes sex, she's a loose slu t. If she 
decides to wait, she's a frigid 
prude. These hasty generalizations 
are so ingrained and so archaic 
that we take them in stride and 
shrug, not even bothering to be 
upset about it. Kick and scream all 
you like, insist that you don't per-
ceive women like that as such; it 
rea lly doesn't matter. The cold, 
harsh truth is that women are 
judged in ways that men are not. 

Granted, this is a gross oversim-
plification of how women are 
viewed within the context of con-
ventional culture. Other things are

Con: Policy of 
preemptive strikes 

is politically 
irresponsible 

continued from /lage 4 
One has the distinct impression 

that the fi ght against terrorism has 
been inserted to gain momentum 
for the whole strategy by intwduc-
ing a topic on which everybody will 
agree even though, from a logica l 
standpoint, the rest of the report is 
quite independent of it. 

The [raqi government, a brutal 
regime for which one would be 
hard-pressed to have any sympathy, 
is the ideal test case for the doc-
trine of the preemptive strike . 
Once Iraq undergoes a "regime 
change," the preemptive strike wil l 
be an accepted doctrine and, next 
time, the United States won't even 
need to bother looki ng for feeble 
reasons to appease the internation-
al community. Whether the United 
States cun afford to build " the 
infrastructure of democracy" in a 
country with a strong Shiite major-
ity that would vote for an Tranian-
style theocracy is, of course, doubt-
ful, but these are puny details. 

The report makes a point that 
"rogue" states will be on the 
receiving side of preemptive 
strikes. States are rogue, we are 
told, if they "squander their natur-
al resources," "violate international 
treaties," "are determined to 
acquire weapons of mass destruc-
tion," and "hate the United 
States," forgctting that the United 
States is gui lty of all these thll1gs 
but the last. These, agai n , arc 
details. 

The Illost revealing and fri ght -
eni ngly interesting aspect of the 
document is the glimpse that It 
gives , beyo nd the illllllcdi :n c 
Middle Eastern concerns, to the 
real target of the new America n 
strategy: Chi na. Iraq is just a clres 
rehearsa l, hm C hin:1 will be rhe 
rea l deal. At page 27, the report 
warns in clea r terlll thut "in pursll-
ing adv,mccd military ca p:lbilitics 
that ca n threaten its neighhor, in 
the Asia-PacifiC region, Chill" i, 
following an olltcitlted path." The 
irony is lost on the facl th at this 
"outdated path" is exactl), the same 
path that the previous 26 pages 
advocate for America : "Our best 
defense is a good offense ." 
Sometimes, apparentl y, what 's 
good for the goose is not good for 
the gander. 

Whether the U.S. will be aLle 
to wage war on a country that, after 
the consolidations of the 1990s, 
contains a significant portion of the 
manufacturing capacity necessary 
for the functioning of the 
American economy remain> to Le 
seen . 

The greatest irony of the 
national security report might lie 
in this fact: The imperial dreams 
that it contains go against the 
interests of the very same multina-
tional corporations that con-
tributed to the party of the presi-
dent. Colonial empires rarely pay a 
dividend and, in the age of global-
ization, maybe even less so. 

The prospects are not reassur-
ing. Ultimately, the possibility that 
all this fanfare about inevitable 
wars will only be a diversion, with 
an eye on the midterm elections, 
from the real problems of a failing 
economic model, financial scandals 
and political corruption may turn 
out to be not only true, bur the 
most desirable alternative.

PICK UP YOUR COPY OF THE ... 

stop that! 
Bertrand Fan 

What I did for the anniversary 
of Sept. I I (an es lly for the first 
day of high school): 

I woke up laIC and watched my 
roommatcs pl ay " Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer" on Xbox. After a 
little while, it dawned on me what 
had to be done. 

"We need the 9/11 rope!" I 
declured. 

\<Vhile my ro mmates were try-
ing to IIgure our what rhe hell I 
was talking about, r du g in the 
ga rage for it, carried it to the liv-
ing room, draped it around the 
TV and plugged it in. The 9/1 1 
rope is a Neon Patriotic Light 
Rope that one of my roommates 
and I found at Horne Depot while 
looki ng for house supplies . A 
quick debate on its necessity lead 
to an immediate impulse buy, and 
until recently, it had been sitting 
in the garage. It glows with pride 
as the single tackiest thing 
Americans have ever made -
Osama bin Laden toilet paper 
coming in a close second. 

The next couple of hours con-
sisted of me playing video games 
on the sofa, watching other people 
play video games on the sofa, 
watching "The Simpsons" on the 
sofa and talking to people on the 
sofa. Almost everything I did 
included the activity of sitting on 
the sofa. Multitasking, if you will. 

Around 7 p.m., I started to get 
hungry. Regretfully, I got off the 
sofa and headed for the kitchen. 

Apparently, my last grocery shop-
pi ng tri p had netted a lot of Coke 
and two pints of Haagen-Dazs 
(coffee and pineapple-coconut fla-
vors). I shrugged, washed a spoon, 
brought the pineapple-coconut 
pint over to the sofa and watched 
my roommate play a car racing 
game while simultaneously satisfy-
ing 40 percent of my daily value of 
fat. 

Thirry minutes later, I started to 
feel sick: and detennined that I 
needed some real food . r convinced 
my girlfriend, Laura, to go with me 
to The Old Spaghetti Factory, to 

" Then he muttered, 
CWhat if I were to kill 
you all l right in down, 

tocwn. San Diego I " 
turned around and start, 

ed walking backward, 
while looking at us." 

which she immediate.ly agreed, and 
we proceeded to downtown San 
Diego. 

The thing with The Old 
Spaghetti Factory is that 
although the spaghetti with 

bro~ned butter and Mizithra 
cheese is a "toothsome treat," 
you're forced to wait extensive 
periods of time to get seated, 
most of which are spent with 
small children crying and scream-
ing. True to form, they quoted 

me a 45-minute wait and handed 
me a vibra ting coaster. 

First, we walked across rhe 
street, where there was a 9/1 I 
exhibit with photographs and patri-
oticlwai ti ng-to-be-sea ted-a t -The-
Old-Spaghetti-Facrory people. All 
in all , the experience was rather 
nauseating, though less so from the 
photographs and more so from the 
quarter-pint of ice cream I had 
ea ten; we left pretty soon. After 
determining that the stores around 
us were worthless, I decided that 
we would walk to Urban Outfitters . 

If you're familiar with 5th 
Street, on which Urban Outfitters 
is located, you'd know that Urban 
Ourfltrcrs is on rhe ass-end other 
side in relatio n to The Old 
Spaghetti Factory. But, after find : 
ing two San Diego Reader dis-
pensers empty, I was determined 
to make it there. As we were walk-
ing toward it, I noticed a tall , black 
m3n in 3 black dress walking 
toward us . A littl e while later, he 
must have turned around, because 
he passed us again. Then he mut-
tered, "Wha t if I were to ki II you 
all, right in downtown San 
Diego," turned around and started 
walking bacl-ward, while looking 
at us. 

Laura grabbed my hand, made a 
sharp right into all empty parking 
lot, and then turned around and 
started walking back to the Old 
Spaghetti Factory. 

I exclaimed, "I can't believe you 
made us turn around. We weIe 
almost there." 

She stormed off, and an hour 
later we were sitting down eating 
salad with bleu cheese dressing

ously decided to drop the class for 
which you registered. We hope 
this change will completely fuck 
up not only your schedule, but 
also your life and sanity. No need 
to thank us - all in a day's work."' 

"As a fun little surprise for you 
guys, the communication depart-
ment decided not to mention that 
to pass this class, you're going to 
have to do at least - and that will 
only get you a C , people - five 
hours of internship work off cam-
pus every week. So if you have 
other classes, a job or any lUnd of 
life at all, you don't get to stay in 
the class!" 

"We don't do add cards. " 
Well, I don 't sit behind a 

counter for a living, so I guess 
we're both cool, right lady? 

Of course, I didn 't actually say 
that. I said, "Well my professor 
told me to bring this to you so I 
could get in her class." 

But what is essential is that Bush 
have the authority and flexibility to 
do whatever is necessary - without 
hindering bickering from Congress 
or hesi tation motivated by a con-
cern for public opinion. Lawmakers 
and the public must understand that 
the president has to be able to act 
decisively if the country is to be 
kept safe. 

those who saw 
this coming danger but failed to 
act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to peace and 
security is the path of action." In 
other words, those who are serious 
about protecting Americans and 
promoting peace worldwide will 
not be afraid to use a little muscle 
when necessary - before damage 
is done to our way of life . 

Well , you can imagine how sur-
prised I was by the fact that those 
biology bitches were actually able 
to screw me during the summer, 
when, theoretically, their powers of 
evil should be somewhat dimin-
ished. But OK. I didn't panic. 
(Actually, I did, but the story 
sounds much more suave this way.) 

It has probably come to the 
attention of some of you readers 
that I work for the GUIlrdilln , 
which has a cuI tish tendency to 
take over your life. Therefore, 
there is no way in htU (or any other 
satanic location) I'm going to be 
able to take that class. 

So I'm back to being screwed. 
Again. 

"You have to register online on 
Oct. 5. It's first-come, first-serve, 
so you should probably wake up at 
7 a.m. and register when WebReg 
opens." 

Bumfights: Popularity of reality TV 
shows foreshadowed 'Bumfights' 

I hauled my ass down to the reg-
istrar's office (because WebReg isn't 
operational during sununer school, 
despite the fact that you can still be 
kicked out of classes online) and I 
signed up for a communication 
class held at the same time. 

Fine. I walked out and headed 
straigh t to the registrar. Of 
course, halfway there I turned 
around and walked back to the 
communication department, 
because they have to stamp my 
drop card first. I have to have their 
permission not to take one of their 
classes. 

For those of you who don't 
have calendars, Oct. 5 is thi s 
Saturday. If I don't get into that 
class, I have not only wasted my 
time sitting there for a week, but 
it's also too late for me to try to 
get into another class because 
everyone smarr enough not to 
mess with the biology department 
is already in them. 

concinuedfrom ~e 5 
watch other people live life than 
actually live it ourselves, are a 
couple of homeless guys picking 
up a few extra dollars to knock 
each others ' lights out really that 
bad? 

People should see this situa-
tion for what it really is. It 's a few 

guys going too far with the "reali-
ty" concept of television and pay-
ing people to do some stupid 
things. It's an over-ambitious 
prosecutor trying to make a name 
for himself when the Las Vegas 
authorities and even the FBI 
couldn't come up with any 
charges. It's not a crime. It's just a 
shame. 

As I'm sure you can imagine, I 
was just al/ lcinds of cool. UCSD 
tried to make me its bitch, but I 
stood my ground . I raised my fist 
defiantly and cried, "No! [ will not 
go quietly into summer school 
because you dropped my class! I 
will fight for my right to take the 
classes I need! I will graduate!" 

After waiting in a line that 
would do Disneyland proud, I'm 
our of the comm class. But now 
what am I supposed to do? 

Try to add another biology 
class, of course. 

So I go to the class, sit through 
a really stressful lecture about 

And I'm back to being 
screwed. 

So basically, I may not have a 
cool outfit, sidekick or cape, but I 
am quasi-super Carrie Elizabeth, 
and I will not rest until the biolo-
gy department goes down . It's not 
like I have anything else to do -
those bio bitches will nrotr let me 
graduate.

9/11 : Man threatens to kill San Diegans 
continued from page 7 

and she's refusi ng to talk to me 
until I "apologize for yell ing at 
her." The following conversation 
ensued, which [ like to call ~the 
stupidest argument I've ever had 
in my life" : 

"I'm not ta lking to you unti l you 
apologize for yelling at me," she 
said. 

"1 wasn 't yelling at you," I said. 
"Yes, you were," she said. "I 

don't think you should yell at 
someone just because they're 
scared. You're supposed to console 
them." 

Suddenly, I'm in an episode of 
"Gilmore Girls." 

"So, let's say I had an irrational 
fear of midgets," I said. "Would 
you console me?" 

"That's completely differen t! 
This wasn't irrational; there was a 
guy who was clearly schizophrenic 
sayi ng that he was going to ki ll us. 
You think it's irrational to walk 
away from someone who just said 
he was going to ki ll you?" 

"Couldn't we have just passed 
him and walked away, yet at the 
same time walked toward Urban 
Outfitters instead of sitting in The 
Old Spaghetti Factory for half an 
hour while I'm bored out of my 
mind?" 

"What?" 
"And he didn't say he was going 

to ki ll you. He said 'you all ,' mean-
ing everybody in San Diego." 

"H e asked us what if he were to 
kill us!" 

"It was clea rly a rhetor ical 
question . He was expressing his 
distaste for 9/ 11 by weari ng all 
black and muttering about what 
woul d happen if it were in San 
Diego." 

"Do you know how many peo-
ple die from schizophrenics 
because they thought they were 
being f~llowe,~? If he had pulled 
out a kJ1lfe .... 

"There was nowhere to put a 
knife in that dress." 

"W ell , [ didn't really want to sit 
there and determine whether or 
not he had a kni fe, I JUSt wanted to 

get the hell out of there." 
"All ['m saying is that we could 

have gotten the hell out of there by 
passing him and sti ll walked toward 
U rban Outfitters." 

"You are a jackass." 
At this point [ started laughing. 
"I don't think it's funny," she 

said. "You really upset me. You 
really hurt my feelings by yelling at 
me while I was scared." 

"You win the typical girl award 
for today." 

"Fuck you." 
"Anyway, the reason I'm laugh-

ing is - you lenow when you were 
sitting in The Old Spaghetti 
Factory and I went outside?" 

"Yeah." 
"I was loolcing for the guy so [ 

could invite him to have dinner 

" If I were in your shoes, I 
would have lied and said 
that I was sarry earlier, 
even if I didn't believe I 

was sarry." 

with us," I sa id . 
"You are the stupidest person 

alive." 
"I just wanted to show you that 

he's probably a good guy, just run 
of the mill crazy and not murder-
ous crazy." 

" I can just see the D arwin 
award." 

The waiter came by, saw us 
yelling at each other, and slowly 
backed away. 

"Look at this, now the wai ter is 
afraid of us. Can you imagine if [ 
pulled him over and I was like, 
'Hey, man. I'm sorry, but th is is 
what we're fighting about. Yes, I 
know this is the stupidest argument 
in the world,' Now ['m not going 
to get a refi ll on my Coke." 

"Serves you right." 
"Look, can you just drop it." 
"You have the power to drop it; 

all you have to do is apologize." 
"But really, you're the one who 

can drop it, because you're making 
the ultimatum that 1 apologize in 
order for it to be dropped." 

"I never said that I couldn't drop 
it ." 

"Then drop it!" 
"Fine, but just lenow that it's in 

the back of my head ." 
"All righ t, I'm sorry. " 
"You're not really sorry." 
"Of course I'm not really sorry 

- I didn 't do anything. " 
"See?" 
"But how the hell would you 

ever lenow 1 was being sincere? 
Would I have to sit here silently for 
a few minutes and then say, 
'Acrually, Laura, you' re right. I'm 
sorry,''' 

"You're r ight, I won't believe 
you." 

"So what the hell do you want 
me to do) I 'm never sincere about 
anything. T here's nothing I can 
do ." 

"Well , it 's your fau lt . If you had 
apologized earlier, I would have 
believed you . If I were in your 
shoes, T would have li t:!d and said 
that I was sorry ea rlie r, even if T 
didn't bel ieve I was sorry." 

Later, in my car, I came up with 
an excellent point. 

"This is ridiculous. We hun g 
out with Wesley Will is , and he 's 
black and schizophrenic, and you 
weren't scared!" 

"T here were lots of people 
there. T his was a dark alley." 

"It's 5th Street!" 
"It was dark. It doesn't matter to 

crazy people where they are when 
they ki ll people." 

"But it matters how many peo-
ple are around them." 

"Right." 
"You're so pulling this out o f 

your ass." 
"The point is not whether or 

not I should hove been scared, it's 
that you yell ed at me and won't 
apologize." 

This argument is s ti ll unre-
solved, but Laura is sti ll the recipi-
ent of the typical girl award for 
today.

Letters: Admissions article was not factual Feminism: UCSD grads' 
pay shows gender differential continued from paJre 5 

landslide reelection of reformist 
President Khatami, who has made 
several overtures to repairing the 
rift between the United States and 
Iran - indicates that rapproche-
ment is being openly debated in 
Iran. These developments, however, 
get lost if we continue to perpetuate 
the stereotypes of Iran. 

T he fact that the GU(J1'dian took 
an interest in publishi ng an article 
of my experience in Iran indicates 
its wi ll ingness to engage in a much-
needed di scussion about Iran. 
Unfortun ately, the ti tl e that it 
sel ected worked agains t its own 
good intenti ons and misrepresent-
ed the spiri t of the article.

Affirmative adion is 
about equal opportunity 

Editor: 
The misrepresentation of affir-

mative ac tion and the UC admis-
sions policies found in the article 
wri tten in the Sept. 24 Opinion sec-
tion of the Guardian merits a 
response. Affirmative action is by no 
means a plan for preferential rreat-
ment. In all actuality, affinnative 
action occurs at any moment "peo-
ple go out of thei r way (take positive 
action) to increase the likelihood of 
true equali ry fo r individuals of dif-
fering categori es," as D rs. f aye 

Crosby and Diana Cordova have 
written. Furthermore, it creates an 
avenue to grant those of e'lual ski ll , 
promise and intelligence a fa ir 
opporruni ty in work or education. 

The opinion article "Whining 
pays off in admissions" is devoid of 
fac t and perpetuates an unfair stig-
ma associated with a program that 
has been federal policy since 1965 . 
We arc further convi nced that the 
arride's writer is oblivious to the 
fact that affirm ative action's mai n 
beneficiary has been and conti nues 
to be whi te women; it has also 
helped create the most gains for the 
fe minist movement. 

Additionally, we fi nd it prob-
lemati c that the writer dwells on 
the idea of Meri IOcraey. T he fo r-
mula "talent + effort = success" has 
been ingrained into 5nldents' psy-
ches from the first day of school. 
While th is is central to a strong 
work ethic, the actual formula is 
"talent + effort + opportullity = suc-
cess." It is important to recognize 
the inequali ty of resources in pub-
lic education. Srudents of affluent 
backgrounds traditionally receive 
an excellent education and more 
opportunity while tllOse from a 
lower socioeconomic bracket 
receive a less extensive educa tion, 
including limited or no access to 
SAT prep or AP and honors cours-
es. In light of thi s unequal access, 
how can admittance be based sole-
lyon G PA and SAT's? Di ffe rential 
access to resources is not equiva-
lent to di fferential qualification . It 
is doubtful , despite the hard work it 

took to gain admittance to this uni-
versity, that many students would 
be here if judged o nly on the basis 
of numbers. 

T he comprehensive admissions 
process at UCSD applies to /loth 
genders and 111/ races and economic 
grou ps. The explanation of the 
point system in the article is not 
compl ete. For instance, an appl i-
cant receives more poi nts for bei ng 
from Califo rn ia tha n for bei ng a 
student of color. So if you want to 
find a group discri min ated against, 
a better example would be those 
who arc from another state. 
Fu rthermore, the post-affirmative 
action admissions system has never 
ad mitted all students 0 11 the basis of 
SAT and G PA scores only. 

Both the holistic a pproach and 
affirmative ac tion allow the univer-
sity 10 become an outlet that teach-
es not simp ly th rough academics, 
but also th rough diverse relation-
ships. Diversity is crucial for a suc-
cessful campus, placing students in 
situations that promote learning 
and ad aptation. 

Lastly, if a holistic approach is 
making acceptance so easy, why 
have the numbers for groups tha t 
are traditionally underrepresented 
fai led to change drastically? The 
real ques tion should be: Is the uni-
versity in place to reproduce advan-
tage and elitism?

taken into account, other things 
become fodder for prejudice: race, 
ethnicity, class, background and 
sexual orientation. But in the end, 
all women are subject to labels. 
And despi te the ove rwhelming 
degree to which these stereotypes 
are applied, as a whole, we refuse 
to admit how very sexist we are. 

Certainly, men are victims to 
sexual objectificat ion. Men are 
upposed to be buff and rugged . 

But the rate for eating disorders 
is still heavi ly sla nted toward 
women. Ask the average person 
to name as many female models 
as he or she can. Then see If he or 
she can name half as many male 
models. Men are sometimes vic-
tims, but not nearly as often as 
they are the perpetrators.

"A New Look Through the G las 
Cei ling: "''here are the Women '" 
compi led from data from th e 
Genera l Accountin g O ffice's 
Current PopulatiC1n Survey. 

Even today, wo men arc paying 
26 cents every hour for no other 
reason then their gender. 

Let's bring the facts closer. 
The UCSD survey of th e gradu-
ating class of 200 I found tha t 
overall , men in entry-Ie"el pmi-
tions are offe red $47,200 pCI' yea r 
and women receive $35 ,900, a 
difference of $5,650. T he survey 
also showed that whet her It :s 
engineeri ng or enterta inment , 
biology or commun ications, 
women who graduate with the 
sa me educa tion as thei r male 
classmates are being offered less. 

If someone were to propose an 
annual tax of $5,650 based on 
gender, the reaction would be 
instant and acrimoni ou . 
Protests, ra ll ies, marches - the 
uproar would be huge. But it 's no t 
the government taking women's 
salaries, it 's society itself. 

T he issue is old . It's been cov-
ered. It 's been dea lt with . So don't 
bring it up, because seXIsm isn't a 
problem any more. At least not 
one that we'll let ourselves see.

T he second someone brings 
up women 's rights, she's cruci fi ed. 
They call her an ungrateful , sub-
urban , femi-N azi brat desperate 
for a (ause. They dismiss what 
she has to say based on the fac t 
that it is coming from someone 
who clearly doesn't know when to 
let an issue go. They will no t be 
confronted by the fac t that to this 
day, women are underrepresented 
in Congress and quite obviously 
in the White H ouse, or that 
female CEOs are few and far 
between, and those who do man-
age to break through the glass 
ceiling are paid less then men. 
And that statistic isn't changi ng. 

In 1963 , the year the Equal 
Pay Act passed, wom en employed 
full time were paid on average 
only 59 percent what men were 
paid, while in 2000 women were 
paid 7 j cents for every dollar 
received by men. These statistics 

We can't keep ignoring th is 
problem: T hat won't change the 
fact that we are a sexist ociety. 
Let 's take a look at the fa cts and 
understand how things really are. 
And before we move on to Ihe 
next hot topic, let 's take a 
moment to deal with this one.

Associate News Editor 

The Price Center has made 
changes to its food court selection 
and physical appearance since the 
200 1-2002 school year, replacing 
the family-run Woks Up restaurant 
with a Panda Express Chinese food 
franchise. 

The facility's exterior physical 
appearance also underwent a 
makeover this summer when the 
colors of the awnings were changed 
from teal to blue and gold. 

Panda Express, which opened 
last week, is located in the food 
court next to Star Wraps. 

Students have mixed emotions 
about the new eatery. Some have 
argued that the loss of a non-cor-
porate owned establishment affects 
the university negatively. 

"The next thing you know, it's 
going to be ' Pepsi presents 
UCSD'," said Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior Calvin Leung. "S tar 
Wraps is probably going to be the 
next to go." 

Panda Express is the second 
corporate food chain to open in the 
Price Center in 2002. Rubio's Baja 
Grill opened last winter quarter 

when it replaced the independent-
ly-owned and operated Tia Molly's 
Mexican food restaurant. 

While some argue that t.he new 
corporate food is a bad idea, others 
see it as an asset to the Price 
Center, as compared to the former 
family-run eateries. 

"If the mom-and-pop places had 
been any good, I'd be sad to see 
them go, but they weren 't any 
good," said Earl Warren College 
senior David Tamjidi . 

J ennifer Lee, a John Muir 
College senior, noted that the qual-
ity of food at Woks Up was not up 
to satisfactory health standards. 

"I didn't get sick, but I couldn't 
finish it," Lee said. 

Many students agreed that 
Panda Express offers a tasty selec-
tion of dishes. 

"The orange chicken is the 
shit," said Warren junior Trevor 
Flyrul. 

Since its opening, Panda 
Express has been host to long lines 
of pauons, which have deterred 
some hurried students. 

"I was going to eat there, but 
the line was too long, so I went to 
Wendy's instead," Lee said. 

Not only has the Price Center 

undergone new additions to irs 
interior, its exterior has also 
received a facelift with the addition 
of new blue and gold awnin!;s, 
which replaced the fadi ng teal and 
white overhangs. 

The idea for the color scheme 
was proposed at a Trito n Tide 
meeti ng. Robin Shelton, chair of 
Triton Tide, said replaci ng the 
awnings was the "logical thing to 
do ." 

The a\~'nings were paid for with 
money from the University 
Centers' capital improvement fund, 
which is used each year to pay for 
whatever needs to be fixed or 
replaced in the University Centers. 
The University Centers Advisory 
Board, UCAB, approved the use of 
capital improvement money for the 
awnings. 

Although some involved in the 
process of changing the awnings 
were initially hesi tant about the 
new colors, Shelton said that 
UCAB, the A.S. Council and 
Triton Tide all agreed that it would 
be a good idea to update the fading 
awnings with spirited co lors. 

"We all agreed that it would be 
a good thing to do, and it woul d 
look good as well," Shelton said.

Manual: Aguilar 
said changes were 

subsequent to 
UCOP'S 

cununued fyom page 2 
StudCIlI Assoc iation were e-
mail ed copies of the revised draft. 
Members of the A.S. Counci l 
responded to the revisio n with an 
extensive list of problems they 
wanted changed. 

A major concern for the A.S. 
Council was the procedure Stu-
dents must undergo to appeal dis-
ci plinary decisions. 

T he initial draft of the manual 
se t a procedure in which students 
dissa ti sfied with the decision 
made by the or iginal administra-
to r assigned to his or her case 
co uld have the case reevaluated by 
another ad ministrator. 

The new decisio n, however, 
would then be either app roved or 
denied by the original adminislnl-
tor. 

"The basic n:llu re of an appeal 
isn 't being ac knowledged if the 
decision being appea led is being 
addressed by the same person," 
Brown s<lid. 

After respondi ng to the initial 
draft via e- mail, th e appeals 
process ha s been changed so that 
ap peals do not filter through the 
o riginal heari ng officers. Agui la r 
sa id th:l t "most" of the changes 
presented by the A.S. Council 
were made, and all were 
addressed . 

Another cha nge from the ini-
tial draft ca ll ed for by members of 
the A.S. C unci I was the issue of 
stud ent photos in the ge neral 
di rectory. 

"Althou!;h we cou ld , we did 
not include photos as one of the 
items in directory info rmati on," 
Agui lar said . 

Initi all y, however, Aguila r did 
includ e photos as part of the 
directory. After meeting with 
members of the A.S . Council , the 
photos were removed from the 
directory. 

Currently, student photos can 
be accessed by faculty and staff 
members if the photo is needed to 
fulfill the staff or faculty person 's 
responsibili ti es . 

To access photos, a staff person 
would have to present his or her 
reason to the custodian of the pho-
tos before a photo can be accessed. 
Aguilar still does not know who the 
ctlstodian of the photos will be or 
where they will be kept. This per-
son, however, will be able to make 
decisions on a case-by-case basis as 
to whether or not a photo can be 
accessed. 

"J don't know who gets them 
or who keeps them or where, but 
whoever gets them or keeps them 
wi ll be the technical custodian of 
tha t record," Aguilar sa id. 

The definition of what is an 
ac ceptable reason to access the 
photos is al 0 a co ncern for mem -
hers of A.S. Council. 

"With no definition, there is 
no way to uphold the sta ndard, " 
Brown said. 

Arguing that photos should not 
be allowed to be accessed by any-
one, members of A.S . Council 
believe that th.ere is no relevant 
need for them. 

"J am very against photos 
being accessi ble for faculty or 
staff," Brown said . "Having pho-
tos accessible leaves students vul-
nerable to racial profiling and a 
professor's whim." 

Aguilar argues that photos 
should be accessi ble to staff for 
reasons like a professor wanting to 
make sure those taking an exam 
are the same students who are 
actually enrolled in the class. 

The new manual is currently 
scheduled to take effect Oct. I . 
Questions about the manual can 
be raised with Aguilar. 

"Anybody who has any ques-
tions about PPM 160-2 can feel 
free to contact me," Aguilar said.

14 NEWS THE UCSD OUARDIAN MONDAY. SEPTEMBER 30. 2002 

Vote: City council passes resolution 
conrinued from page I dents to vote. The group plans to hold another voter registration 

drive during third week. 

Rank: UCSD places 31st 
among all universities 

District 1 Council member 
SCOtt Peters sponsored the largely 
symbolic resolution that was the 
product of several months of lob-
bying by rhe YourhVote Coalition, 
which is a nonpartisan group seek-
ing to increase the participation 
rate of young voters. 

The coalition is made up of 
representatives from San Diego 
State and the University of San 
Diego as well as various UCSD 
ca mpus groups that include the 
A.S. council, college councils and 
CaIPIRG. 

The city council meeting was 
a ttended by a group of four 
UCSD students representing the 
Youth Vote Coalition . Melinda 
Gibson, chapter chair of CalPIRG 
at UCS D and a second-year at 
Eleanor Roosevel t College, was 
one of the members in attendance 
who spoke before the city council. 

Afterward, Gibson said she was 
delighted with the unanimous pas-
sage of the resolution and said 
other groups in other California 
cities were duplicating the effort.

at the Sept. 24 proceedings. 

debate between the candidates. 
While Gov. Gray Davis has 
declined to debate, Republican 
challenger Bill Simon has agreed, 
according to Gibson. 

"This is going to help us and 
give us more clout in terms of pre-
senting this to [Davis] and getting 
him to agree to this debate," she 
said. 

Gibson said despite the Davis 's 
refusal to attend the gubernatorial 
debate, the organization is contin-
uing to pressure his campaign. 

"We really want students to 
know that this is something that 
you do," Gibson said. "YOLI step 
on campus, you register to vote, 
you increase your voice as a stu-
dent." 

Gibson stressed that those who 
register wi th an on-campus 
address will be able to vote at on-
campus locations. 

A.S. PresidentJenn Brown also 
attended and spoke at the Sept. 24 
city council meeting. She said 
afterward that the presence of sm-
dems at the meeting and the suc-
cess of having a resolution spon-
sored and passed is the beginning 
of greater involvement from the 
coalition of San Diego-area uni-
versity studems. 

"The main reason why we 
wanted the city council endorse-
ment was so we could come to city 
council and show them that we are 
running a voter registration cam-
paign, and that the studem voice 
in San Diego matters and will 
matter in the upcoming years," 
Brown said. 

continued from page I 
Brown. "The quality really shows in 
our university." 

The u.s. Nrws and Wm-ld Repurt 
survey is based on seven weighted 
factors, which include the assessment 
of a university by top officials at peer 
instimtions (25 percent), graduation 
and freshman retention rates (20 per-
cent), smdent to professor ratio and 
faculty salary and qualifications (20 
percent), competitiveness of the 
application process (15 percent), the 
financial resources of the universi ty 
(10 percent), the percent of alumni 
that gives to the university (5 per-
cent), and how much the university 
has "increased" the graduation rate 
over a calculated base value (5 per-
cent). 

A u.s. Nrws and World Report 
spokesman was unavailable for com-
ment. 

"[fhe ranking is] a nice prestige 
factor, ranked against other schools 
of our size and in our system," said 
UCSD spokeswoman Pat Jacoby. "It 
doesn 't influence too many people.~ 

Brown said that although 
UCSDs ranking is unchanged since 
last year, the school is improving. 
The new Chicana/Chicano Studies 

major, business school and pharmacy 
school will make UCSD a better 
university, according to Brown. 

"It will be good for the university 
to have a national understanding of 
the education available at UCSD," 
Brown said . "1 think that 31 st seems 
like it's a fairly accurate assessment of 
UCSD." 

John Muir College fresh man 
Helen Shin said that she looked at a 
college ranking system when decid-
ing where to go to college. 

"I got into Davis also," Shin 
said. "I compared [UC Davis and 
UCSDj and rUCSD] was consider-
ably higher." 

Revelle college freshman Gordon 
Ho said that he chose UCSD over 
Stanford University because of the 
programs offered here. 

"Those kind of things don't show 
in the rankings," Ho said. 

Several snldents said that they 
did not look at a national college 
ranking system when deciding where 
to go to college. 

"You're pretty much going to get 
whatever education you want," said 
Muir freshman Amanda Della Mora. 
"It just depends on how much you 
put in your own education." 

"It's really important to us in 
our efforts of organizing students 
to have the support of the city and 
[that] we show them that this is a 
statewide effort as well as a city-
wide effort, and that city councils 
across the state are also joining 
in," she said. -

Gibson hopes that the council's 
passage of the resolution will aid 
the coalition's goal of having a 
youth-oriented gubernatorial 

"The fight is not over yet," she 
said. "Election day hasn't come, so 
we're still working on it and push-
ing that, but he's still an obstacle 
in that respect." 

Focusing on more immediate 
concerns, the YouthVote 
Coalition spent the remainder of 
the day registering UCSD sm-

Brown envisions more involve-
ment by the coalition and area stu-
dents in the city council regarding 
issues affecting studem interests in 
San Diego, such as transportation 
and affordable housing. 

"Through our coalition with 
San Diego State and USD, we 
hope to create a unified student 
voice with the city council," 
Brown said.

The physical games followed 
shortly after, with new students from 
each college competing in events like 
the balloon toss, bat relay, balloon

After three hours of cheers and 
chants, Revelle college came out on 
top, defeating two-time defending 
champion Warren college by a final 
score of 280 to 260. 

Muir, Marshall and Roosevelt 
colleges followed closely, with Sixth 
College finishing in last place in its 
first appearance at the Unolympics. 

"1 think this year's students are 
one of the most spirited and excit-

Terry, dean of student affairs at 
Revelle college. " Roger Revelle 
would be proud." 

Revelle college also won this 
year's spirit night competition. 

"This is my first year at UCSD, 
and 1 think this event is a great way 
to get all the colleges together," 
said Tim York, a freshman at 
Warren college. "I'd like to see 
more events like this throughout 
the year. It was awesome."

Alternative bookstores sometimes provide better deals 
Shopping around can save you 
money when buying textbooks 

By SUSAN CHOI 
Contributing Writer 

Fall quarter has begun, and as 
usual , there IS a mad rush of students 
pw-chasing textbooks for their class-
es. Although the UCSD Bookstore 
is the main textbook source for Stu-
de nts, it is not the only on-campus 
location for purchasing books, nor is 
it the cheapest. 

"I didn 't realize one book co t 
$80," said Rose Sbardellati , a Revelle 
College senior who bought all her 
books at the University Bookstore. 

So where can one save a li ttle 
mo ney by findin g the cheapest 
textbooks' 

The University Bookstore, con-
ve n ie ntly loca ted in the Pri ce 
Centl:r, carri es the most textbooks, 
varying by academic department 
and individual course. Al though 
th is bookstore is a conven icm loca-
tion to purchase books and it car-
ries nea rly all the subjects one 
co ul d need, prices have hee n 
noticeably marked up. 

Many courses have u ed texts in 
stock along Witll the new ones, in 
which case tile price of the used 
books are often drastica lly lower 
than the new texts. For instance, 
the pnee for a used P ych 179 text-
book is a low $49 compared to the 
price for the new versio n, which 
costs $66. 35. That $ 17.35 you 
woul d save could buy a couple of 
days' worth of lunch. Along the 
same lines, a new Calculus 20 series 
text COSts a whopping $1 05 com-
pared to the used one, which costs 

only $78.75 - a $26.2 5 difference. 
Clark Peterse n, an Eleanor 

Roosevelt C ollege sophomore, 
spent a total of $336 this quarter 
purchasing h is books at the 
U niversity Bookstore. 

"I bought my books at the book-
store because it's convenient, and I 
don't really care about the cheapest 
prices .. . it's not a big deal," he said . 

Brandon Borso, another 
Roosevelt sophomore who also 
bought his books at the booksto re a 
day before cla sses officially began, 
said, "My onl y problem with the 
bookstore is that the texts run out 
too quickly." 

Another location on campus to 
purchase textbooks is Groundwork 
Books, a nonprofi t store loca ted in 
the Stud enr Cenrer that gives all of 
its sales receipts to the Student Co-
Op. T herefore, while G roundwork 
does not guara ntee th at its text 
p rices wi ll be lower th an the 
U niversity Bookstore, it docs not 
Illark up its pri ces . Although 
Groundwork mai nly carries fiction 
and nonfictio n books with interests 
in the pol itical and sociological sec-
tors of the worl d, it also has tcxt-
books for c1assc in history, litera-
ru rt: , commun ication, political sci-
ence and others. 

"Since we are a nonproH t orga-
nization, and we are an organiza-
tion mad e to serve students, we 
don't mark up prices on textbooks," 
said Eleazar Loza, a junior and 
G roundwork empl oyee. 

W hen asked why GrOlmdwork 
doesn't carry textbooks for the sci-

ences and other subjects, Loza 
answered, "Professors and depart-
ments place orders with us, and 
that's how we determine which text-
books to ca rry. T hanks to tile profes-
sors' and students' help and suppOrt 

of G roundwork, we're able to pro-
vide them wi th better service. II 

For added co nvenience , this 
year G roundwork will be accepting 
major credit cards as payment.

UCSD faculty and staff keep the beach clean 
The International Coastal Cleanup keeps the coastline clean throughout California 

By MARGOT STILES 
Contributing Write r 

Visualize 4,000 pounds of ciga-
rene butts, empty bags of chips and 
beer cans - the morning after 
from hell. Now imagine this stuff 
in the sand of your favorite beach 
or floating through your favorite 
surf spot, and you can understand 
why students, faculty and staff from 
UCSD pitched in on Sept. 21 at 
the Internationa l Coastal Cleanup. 

"Plastics, Styrofoam and ciga-
rette butts are usually the No. I 
pollutant on beaches," according to 
the San Diego Baykeeper on its 
Web site. The San Diego 
Baykeeper is a nonprofit organiza-
tion mat works toward the protec-
tion of California's beaches. 

"Scientists estimate that entan-
glement or ingestion of plastic ki lls 
one million sea birds and over 
100,000 marine mammals (whales, 
sea ls and dolphins) annually," me 
Web site explains. 

To help solve this problem, a 
team of UCSD students, faculty 
and staff combed La Jolla Shores 
fo r litter as part of "Hands-On 
San Diego," a one-day volu nteer 

challenge. A second team of divers 
from UCSD Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography looked for trash in 
the underwater canyo n near La 
J ali a Shores. 

"Much of me pollution comes 
from storm drains that carry urban 
runoff from land to receiving 
waters," said the San Diego 
Baykeeper's Web site. Most of the 
trash found on Sanlrday was origi-
nally discarded on highways, city 
streets or beaches, and was then 
carried to the ocean by runoff dur-
ing storms or lifted directly off the 
beach by the rising ride. 

While the great majority of lit-
ter picked up at the coastal 
cleanup comes from land, aba n-
doned fishi ng lines and nets are 
also a significant problem in the 
ocean, where they can continue to 
catch fish and entangle other ani-
ma ls for yea rs after they have been 
discarded . Since plastic in the 
ocean does not break down for 
many years, some ships at sea sort 
plastic out from the food scraps 
they dump overboard . 

Once trash reaches the coast, it 
can be a serious hazard to marine 
animals that swallow or become 

entangled in plastic debris. A plas-
tic bag floating in the water can 
look a lot like a jellyfish, the 
favorite food of sea turtles and 
marine mammals. Seabirds also eat 
cigarette butts accidentally, mistak-
ing them for food . 

This year's International 
Coastal Cleanup involved cities 
throughout California, the United 
States and over 100 countries 

" Scientists estimate that 
entaglement ar ingestion 
of plastic kills one million 

sea birds annually." 
~ San Diego Baykeeper 

around the world . In 1993, the 
coastal cleanup earned a place in 
the "Guinness Book of World 
Records" as the largest garbage 
collection ever. The first official 
cleanup was organized in Oregon 
in 1984, followed by similar events 

in California and Texas, and 
national cl eanups have continued 
with sponsorship from the Ocean 
Conservancy. UCSD has been 
involved several times through 
Committee for Human and Public 
Services, the student organization 
for community service at Scripps 
Oceanography. 

Students from C.H.I.P.S . joined 
other San Diego divers to sea rch 
for garbage in the dimly lit depths 
of La Jolla Canyon. Sand, water 
and trash from the north are car-
ried by currents down the coast 
into the canyon, creating a dynam-
ic underwater beach that is also a 
good place to look for garbage. 

Yueng-Djern Lenn and Liz 
Douglass, both graduate students 
in oceanography, won a free div-
ing trip for retrieving the largest 
piece of trash: an old T-shirt. 

Divers also retrieved various 
disposable food wrappers, one of 
me most common items found in 
previous underwater cleanups 
around the country. 

On land, Jeff Severinghaus, 
Guillaume Mauger and numerous 
other members of the UCSD com-
munity picked up trash on La Jolla

The ocean is impacted by mallY 
human activities, from overtlshing 
to global climate change. However, 
the problem that people most often 
notice is the appearance of a dirty 
beach. This may explain why pollu -
tion was consistently named as the 
No. I problem affecting tlle ocean 
in a 2002 survey conducted by 
Edge Research/SeaWeb in 
California and the nation as a 
whole. 

Another problem with occan 
health is beach pollution. In the 
same way it carries li tter to the 
ocean, rain washes excess oil from 
cars, fertilizers and pesticides from 
lawns, and dog droppings from 
sidewalks - all into the ocean. 

Many surfers are aware of th is 
problem and intentionally ,woid

The Surfrider Foundati on's Bluc 
Water Ta k Force trains voluntcer, 
to check water :It their nei ghbor-

This information is then posted on 
the \Veb to alert surfers abou t the 
presence of polluted wa ter. This 
kind of pollution is call ed a n n-
point ource pollution because it 
comes from many small human 
activities radler than a si ngle oil

2O FEATURES THE ~CSD GUAR DIAN 

the editors' 
soapbox 

Jessica Lingel 

The daily grind of working 
retail pays off in experience 

Frolll the nl1(l - 18th cenrurv to 
the I:l1d of \ \ 'orld \,I,'ar II, it ,;as a 
(Olllltl OI1 pracrice among devel-
ope" Europc'ln nations to require 
two ycarS of lIlilitarv service from 
,!I! lilJle citizens. it wasn 't just 
cnli~rln!, . il wasn 'r signi ng forms 
,lIld It certainly wasn't voluntary. If 
I had my way, we would set up a 
)lmil'lr practice in the Uni ted 
States - onll' with remil. 

,\1 ,. s).ste ll~ wouldn't require twO 
vcars, necessarily. II wouldn 't even 
;·call,. have to be full time - the 
ret:lil reljui rement could be fu l-
fi lled collcurre ntly during high 
,>c hool or college. 1'llI not out to 
ho l>tcr the U.S. econumy with a 
.,urg-c of wurker" and ItS' not jusr 
hecame I W:lIlt more people to feel 
the part-tillle p;lin that I feel. It's 
J u, t that the world would he ;1 
l1luch hetter place if we all had to 
work III customer ~l!rvice. 

\ \'orking in rellil is a remark-
,Ihle life experience, and people 
\I ho miss out on it Jre so ridicu-
louslv luekv. You can always tell 
whel; yo u have ;1 clien t a '; your 
hands who Iws never work ed 
ret;lIl. They arc the peop le who 
think rh :\t "shr ink" is just an 
unfortunate co nseque nce of 
putting wool in the dryer. For 
tho>e uf YOll who Jctually ttlll into 
tim cllc!'DrY: Burn il; hell -
.,h rtllk l> ,I code lVord for shoplift-
IIlI! , ,lilt! C:l1l be either internal 
( c~lpl(»)'ecs) or external (c us-
tOlllers). They arc the customers 
\I hu :IPP:lrenrly don't fold d oth-
In!:\, in rhe,r own homes , who 
knuck ovcr a shelf display and 
dun 't even glance at rhe mess 
the\" \'e made, who ask if yOU work 

the~c when yo u' re helpi~g anoth-
er dlent, in uni forlll , wirh a heacl-
ser, name tag- and a labeled box or 
merchandise. They are the cus-
tOllle rs whuse mi ssio n JI1 life is to 
make you insanely miserable. 

\\'~'d all be more polite if we all 
had to work retail. A universallv 
essential - and extremely annoy-
ing - part of training for any rewil 
jub is etiquette. T raining videos are 
inundated with people who look 
like thei r sale source of nutrition is 
Valiulll and Adero!. In retail. moti -
vational posters are like wallpape r, 
lini ng every sq uare foot of the back 

rooll1s. They even tape little catch 
phrases to rhe phone, usually wirh 
a n accompa nying remi nd er to 
, mile. Brainwashing, perhaps, but 
definitely an improvement ove r the 
extrellle lack of common courtesy 
thar engulfs modern society. Ir 'cI h~ 
g reat if everywhere you went, peo-
ple were consta ntly greeting you, 
asking if you needed help and 
thanking you (regard less of 

" Working in retail is a 
remarkable life experi, 
ence , and people who 
miss out on it are so 
ridiculously lucky." 

whether or not they made a pur-
chase, because vou want their stOre 
experience to be a posi tive one). 

We'd :I II be able to bullshit. 
Veterans of retai l all grimace at the 
phrase, "suggestive se ll ing." 
Doubtless derived frolll the fruits of 
a l11ultirude of management brain-
storming, the all irerative phrase 
really translates into "force a prod-
ucr on the customers without them 
knowing it." E mployers will give 
you these impossibly ridicul ous 
threats disguised as quest ions, li ke 
" D id you know that 80 percent uf 
customers will leave the sa les floor 
after two to four minutes if they are 
not greeted within 20 to 30 seconds 
of their arrival''' or " Did you know 
tl1at 85 percent of customers come 
into a store with something specific 
in mind even if they say that they're 
' jUSt looking"" 

In other words: Smil e, dammit. 
Sell your soul if it mcans generating 
:I sale. But it 's a valuable s kill , learn-
ing how to bullshit. Paper-writing, 
pressing parents for cash and break-
ing up come to mind. And honestly, 
we'd all be better people if we'd just 
learn that no matter how bad your 
day is, you still have to smile, greet 
people and manipulate all you can to 
get what it is you really wan t. We'd 
all be :l lot berter at :lcronyms. 
Acronyms seem to be an integral 
part of large-scale rerai l stores. An 
entirely plausible sentence could be, 
" \Vould you consul t your CSM 
about the IBC of getting the BBV 
ready for the MFSR'" (Transhlrion: 
Your manager will kick your ass if 
you don't ge t that snIff alit like she 
tOld YOll.) And then there are all the 
ways to talk about pro fits without 
letting rhe customer know, like "We 
need to work on increasing our ADS 
so th~1t the SPH can renect the hi gh-
est AT possible." (Average Dolhlr 
Sa le, Sales Per Hour and Average 
Tra nsaction, respectively.) A society 
that is better ar acronyms is clearly 
advancing. 

Retail isn't just a way of ea rning 
money, it's a method o f dealing 
wi th the world . People who have 
ncve r worked with people, people 
who have never been paid for sub-
servience, people who have never 
had to live every working day in 
dosed-toed shoes are basically use-
less citizens. . 

T he rea so n hehind enforced 
ervice thro ughout Eu rope was to 

have massive 3mOunts of military 
might. T hose kinds of policies 
allowed European armies to mobi-
lize immedia tely, to defend them-
selves in an inst:lnt and to make 
their ci ri ze ns better citize ns. 

Mandatory rerail would have 
similar benefits. \lVe 'd all manage to 
conform to some level of basic 
politeness, complete with eye con-
tact :md friendly body language. 
Thanks ro tons of sa fety videos and 
posters showing safety do 's and 
don'ts, we'd certa inly be more safe. 
Most importa ntl y, if everyone 
worked in remil, we'd all get along. 
Years of collective suffering could 
mold us into a cohesively e mpathet-
ic socierv. And if not, we'd all be able 
to fake it with remarkable ease.

and mCtilcl'al crafts. "I attended [a 
cbssJ rhis Illorning that was very 
good about Justinian und 
Theodora and the Bvzantine 
empire," Ferrel said. • 

I t's sa Fe to say these classes are 
not your typicu'l college courses, 
iJut that's \l'hy SCA members keep 
coming agalll and again to events 
like the one on Saturday. 

"We are a 1\ l edieval history 
dub," sa id April Ferrel, the reign-
Ing queen of ht:r SCA chapter. "It 
IS .1 club devoted 10 interest in 
anything roughly from rhe rime of 
Charlemagne to the 16005. Pretty 
mllch wc're talking abollt early 
middle ages through the 
R"nn;lISS3nce ... 

"The focus of this history club 
IS reanactment rather than dry 
lecture format," Ferrel said. 
"!I lost uf liS have taken history 
classes and fou nd them a bit 
tedious." 

Playing with sharp objects: A couple of SCA members try their 
skills at fencing among onlookers outside the International Center. 

Along with dressing lip in peri-
od cu,wmes, the group holds 
c1a~ses on everything from vine-
gar making to lI1t:ciieval weaponry. 

"\N" also tend to be a group of 
people who ~njoy doing hands-on 
things," Ferrel said. " If you louk 
around, you'll see costumes, 
woodworking; we have classes in 

t~aching spi nning and -weaving 
,lIld period danre." 

I n fact, you will find arts and 
handcraft all over SCA events, 
whether it is someone knitting 
under a tree or a group of people 
carving lVood. The schedule is full 
of activities with forgotten traits 

Like any national non-profit 
organization, SCA is organized 
into several different chapters, or 
"kingdoms," such as those as~oci­
ated with universities or coll eges, 
as was the case on Saturday. 

"There is a chapter of our 
group, [the co ll ege of St. 
Artimus!. that is a student club at 
UCSD," Ferrel said. 

Occasionally, YOll may find 
SCA at stonehenge holding a 
fencing competition or taking 
part in arts ancl crafts. 

"We like the art they ca ll 
"stonehenge" because it's always 
coo l, even in ugust," Ferrel said, 

o the next time you see a 
small rennaissance fair congregat-
ed somewhere on ca mpus, don't 
be afraid - JUSt say hello, or good 
morrow.

Textbooks: Students find creative ways to buy books 
cll1wnllcd from pllRe ,6 

hookstore is often overlooked. Still , 
for the sntdenrs who do purchase 
their texts frOlll the tore, they are 
most often either savml:( mon~y or 

lookJ!l~ fo r a book that ra n out of 
,tuck in the bookstore. T he sales 
receipts all go to the Sntdent Co-Op 
as well. 

Snulcnts are also finding other 
means to save a little money on 
books. ,\1any srudems are borrowing 
textbooks from the library or photo-
copyi ng the required pages rather 

than acnlally buying the book. 
" [ once rook a hUlllanities 

course, and they wanted me to buy 
this huge textbook that cost about 
$1 ~O , and we were only reading a 
couple chapters in it," said senior 
Candice Pelsky. "So I borrowed the 
book from a friend and photo-
copied the parts I needed . It only 
ended up costing me $30." 

For those sntdents who find it 
necessary to own their books they 
can also purchase books from other 
smdents at lower prices. On average, 

Choose your 
rite of own 

the textbooks that the sn ldents 
themselves sell can be about $5 
cheaper than the price of the same 
used book sold in the University 
Bookstore. 

From purchasing books at the 
University Bookstore to photocopy-
ing pages out of a borrowed text-
book, sntdents are rushing to collect 
their materials for the new academic 
quarter. By investing a little time 
into finding the cheapest textbooks, 
sntdems may fi nd it surprising how 
much they could end up saving.

1' 111 al most ashamed of the 
UCS f) stu de nts who dOIl 't know 
about the past success of our T ritol1 
t':ams, but 1' 111 not complctcly sur-
prised, because I know that only a 
few people go to games. I'm used 10 
reporting on a soccer game and sit-
ting in the sta nds with parents of 
athletes and the only other student 
there is a Guardian photographer. 

So here's a quick overview for 
th ose of ),Oll who don '[ know much 
about U Sf) sports. T he Tritons 
dominate Division II sports, liS evi-
den ccd by our thi rll-pl ace linish in 
th e 2002 Sea rs Directors' Cup, the 
award givcn to the top Division II 
,Ith leti cs program. Also, UCS D has 
won 29 national titlcs since 1970, 
and women's soccer head coach 
Brian McM anus and his Tritons 
have been nati onal cham pions six 
[illles in the last eight years. 

Thc word about UCSD sporrs 
is startin g to get out, but I'm going 
to chall enge a few of [he six people 
reading th is column. Instead uf 
studyi ng th is Salll rd:lY night, go to 
RIMAC 1\ l'cna and watc h thc 
women 's voll eyball tcalll play. Be a

lintil }'ou do just a couple of the 
l hing~ that UCS D has to offer. it's 
going to be boring. U ntil you get 
Ollt of your roo m, you are going to 
dislike goi ng to school here. And to 
the few sti ll -bitter Tritons who did-
n 't enjoy the atmosphere of the 
sporring eve Ilt and regret not stay-

WE'RE LOOKING FOR SIBLINGS 
IN A BRIEF HEALTH STUDY AT U(SD! j UCSD researchers would like to meet siblings, for a brief study on how heredity influences blood pressure in hea lthy persons. Siblings are brothers, sisters, or brothers and sisters; SO, pract ically everybody is a sibling and has sibl irgs (brothers or sisters) . We are especially interested in sibl ing trios () brothers or sisters in the 

same family) . Because sibli ngs share genes, siblings allow us to fin d 
out how heredity influences traits. We seek both male·male, female· 

female. and male·female sibling groups. We seek sibli ngs of either 
sex, age 18 or older, and all ethnic groups or races. 

The study takes about 40 minutes, and includes measurement of 
blood pressure and heart rate, as we ll as taking a blood and urine 
sample. We will provide monetary compensation for your time and 
travel. 

If you and your sibling would like to fi nd out more about this 
study, please contact Uty Rao, It tet (858)-552-8585, extension 6158; 

fax (858)-642-6))1; or e·mail frao@ucsd .edu .

Volleyball: Tritons fall to 
bitter rival CSUSB 

Are you interested in learning healthy 
eating and exercise habits? 
Do you want to feel better 

about your body? 
SDSU Re earchers are studying the long-term benefits 

of a new internet-based educational program that 
addresses healthy weight maintenance and improved 

body image concerns. This program is designed 
specifically fo r college women. The study is being 

conducted by Dr. Denise Wilfley, Professor of 
Psychology, SDSU and is approved by CPHS. 

For more information, contact Katie at 619.594.3109 or e-mail krichards@project.sdsu.edu 

cominued from page 32 
dashed when Mills was called a 
"bitch" by one of the Coyote coach-
es, as several Triton players reported 
later. This was about more than JUSt 
volleyball. 

"Its an intense rivalry. There's a 
lot of hatred between perso nali ties, 
and that's what I didn 't know 
before," said sophomore transfer 
and newcomer-to-the-Ieud Bonnie 
Wilson. "Soll~e of th~~e girls on 
that team are JUSt rude. 

In the first game, however, the 
Coyotes were polite gues ts. They 
fumb led their way through the tirst 
game and dropped it to a UCSD 
squad that didn't play very well 
ei ther. 

T he second game brought 
another 30-28 score, but this time 
CSUS B was able to come up with 
the critical points that leveled the 
match. 

T he thi rd game stayed tight. 
T he Tritons stretched out to a 26-
22 lead late in the game, due in 
large part to the playoff the bench 
of freshmen Francesca Centofanti 
and Brianna Koche. The lead was 
short-lived, however, as the 
Coyotes made an 8-2 run to take 
another game 30-28.

With their backs against the wall 
in the fourth game, UCSD came Out 
fighti ng and dominated the pace and 
flow of the game, surging to a seven-
point lead at 19- 12. Bonnie Wilson 
led the Tritons on the night with n 
kills. eight of them coming in the 
fourth game. 

However, from that point on, the 
Tritons began to make mistakes. 
Down the stretch, it was Coyote star 
Kim Ford who took over the game, 
notching the last of her match-high 
27 ki lls to seal the CSUSB victory at 
30-26. 

After rallying to the cry of 
"Together'" the night before, the 
T ritons met with McFarland in ,\ 
back room for 25 minutes follow-
ing the loss to figure out what had 
gone wro ng. 

"We're playing very, very hard 
individually, but we haven't gelled as 
a team," McFarland said. "I'm con-
fident that we can beat [CSUSB1. 
but we 'll need to improve quite a bit 
before we do that." 

The Tritons will work at that 
improvement in their upcoming 
home CCAA matches 011 Oct. 1,4 
and 5, counting the days until the 
rematch ,vith CSUSB on Nov. I , 
and trying to get back to playing 
"together."

Tritons administer a beating to CSULA 
Men's soccer thumps the Golden Eagles on road 5-1 

By MARK mCKEL 
Contributing Writer 

On the strength of a solid defen-
sive effort and a hat trick from 
Tiago Venturi . the UCSD men's 
soccer team defeated California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
opponent Cal State Los Angeles on 
the road on Sept. 27 . 

The Triton scoring began early, 
with Venturi putting his first goal 
past CSULA goalkeeper Raymond 
Wilhelm in the eighth minute of 
the game. The UCSD offense kept 
up the pressure and was able to 
score twice more in the first half. 
with an unassisted goal from Burke 
Fathy and a penalty kick goal from 
Kris Chiles. 

In the second half. the Golden 
Eagles appeared to pick up their 
level of play. CSULA had several 
close shots that went wide, and sev-
eral corner kick attempts that were 
stopped by UCSD goalkeeper 
Scott Mazurier. 

CSULA's persistence, possibly 
combined with Triton laziness with 
a large lead , allowed CSULA for-
ward Ni kos Gutrugia nios to head 
the ball in fo r a goal in the 79th 
mi nute. 

However. tha t was as close as 
the Golden Eagles would get. In 
the final 10 minutes of the match , 
UCSD looked as if it we re playing 
against a high school team . domi -
nating play at both ends of the 
field. Venturi scored twice more, 
once off a defl ection from the post 
and another time bea ting the 
CSULA goalkeeper one-on-one to 
finish up his ha t trick. 

The win brings the Tritons to 6-
2 overall and 4-2 in the CCM, 
while CSULA drops to 3-7 overall 
and 1-5 in the CCAA. The win is 
the second blowout vicrory in a row 
for the Trirons. UCSD shut out 
San Francisco State, 4-0. on Sept. 
22 . 

T he Tritons continue their 
series of road games on O ct. 4 
against Chico State and play at Guardian file photo 
home on Oct. 11 against Cal State 
Stanislaus. On the road .. ain: UCSD beat CSULA in its first of a series of four games on the road. The Tritons, now with an overall rernrd of 6-2, will play Chico State on Od. 4.

UCSD's unity 
suffers from 
traditional 
Unolympics 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

I often ge t confused abou t wh~re I go ro school. Am I a Revelle student or 
<1m I a UCSD student) \Nhich one 

take~ precedence; 
Personally, I love supporting 

CSD. I want ro see other people 
love it the way I do; so anything 
that increases spirit on campus has 
my seal of approval. That being 
said, I'm not 0 sure I like the 
Unolympics. 

i\1 egaphonc 111 hand, I led a 
half-mile long column of mostly 
Revelll: freshmen over t RIMAC 
Field last Wcdne day. T hey chant-
ed and cheered and gave off such a 
ca refree, genera l feeling that they 
might have been mistaken for 
SDSU students had it n t been for 
the conspicllolls lack of alcohol 

They were proud to b h rt: 
But "here" rook on a diftert:nt 
meaning once we arrived :Il the 
field . 

Students of six colleges, 
dressed distinctly and grouped 
together, rook their places around 
the given area and faced off. Add a 
few cannons, muskets and handle-
bar mustaches , and the scene 
might have been mistaken for the 
Civil War. 

G ranted, Revelle and Muir have 
no designs of seceding from the 
union, nor did the addition of Sixth 
College raise as much controversy 
as the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but 
the prevailing wisdom of that time 
still applies. 

A house divided against itself 
ca nnot stand . 

Six colleges dividing themselves 
and digging trenches between each 
other do not a great university 
make. 

I sat in the front row, next to 
Chancellor Robert Dynes, for 
UCSD's volleyball game agai nst 
Cal Poly Pomona on Friday night. 
He and I were joined by 1,325 
other people, most of whom were 
cheering for the Tritons. The rest 
were visiting Cal Poly parents 
lamenting the fact that their chil-
dren weren't smart enough to get 
into UCSD. 

Of the former group, however, 
I saw no divisions. I saw blue 
megaphones and bright UCSD 
garb worn proudly. I didn't see 
Warren students, Marshall stu-
dents, ERC students, Revelle stu-
dents, Sixth students and Muir stu-
dents. Nor did I see an empty seat. 

I saw UCSD students every-
where. I heard UCSD students 
proud to make noise for their 
school and it made me proud to 
count myself in their number. 

After the dust cleared on 
Wednesday, I carried the Golden 
Shoe back to Revelle, and set it 
down on a conference room table. I 
set it down and let it go. Here's 
hoping that the trophy gathers dust 
until next year. 

It's time to forget where we eat, 
what general education require-
ments we have and where we lived 
freshman year. It's time to become 
a campus without borders, and to

Volleyball earns split over weekend 
III 

UCSD wins one before record crowd at RIMAe Arena 
By BRYCE WARWICK 

Staff Writer 

In a weekend ,hat has been circled on many 
volleyball fans' calendars all year, the UCSD 
women's team came up with a thrilling victory 
over Cal Poly Pomona before dropping a tight 
match with Cal State San Bernardino. 

The Broncos came into RIMAC Arena with 
their record untarnished in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play, while the Tritons 
looked to please the record crowd that filled the 
entire west side of the arena. 

Re ponding to a free barbecue before the 
game and a massive promotional effort by 
Triton Tide, 1,327 fans attended the g,lI11e, 
shattering the old record of 1,13 5 set during 
the 1997 Division III championship game. 

In spite of the large crowd, the TritOns start-
ed slowly and had a hitting percentage of only 
.068 en route to dropping the first game 30-27 . 
Behind the strong offense of junior Lauren 
Mills and numerous Bronco errors, UCSD 
rebounded to easily win game two 30-13 . 
While her teammates seemed unsettled initial-
ly, Mills credited her early success to attitude. 

"I was just going aggressive and swinging 
away, and once everyone else caught on to that, 
we were all just going aggressive," Mills said. 

Game three opened with a very question-
able call in favor of Cal Poly that threw the 
Tritons off and shifted the momennun of the 
game. By the time UCSD had recovered, it was 
fighting from a 5-0 deficit. Katie Hogan had a 
strong service run to bring the game back even, 
but in the end, attack errors at inoppornme 
times led to a 30-26 Bronco victory. 

Triton head coach Duncan McFarland later 
tried to explain his team's early problems. 

"We seemed to be real nervous tonight," he 
said. "It's our first big conference match at home, 
and knowing we've got a tough team [to play], it 
just felt like everybody was kind of tight." 

In an attempt to shake things up, McFarland 
switched setters, bringing in senior Jessica 
Bartter in game four. Bartter made an immedi-
ate impact, coming up with several huge blocks 
and getti ng the ball to her teammates in good 
situations. UCSD responded by bringing the 
match to a pivotal fifth game with a 30-21 win. 

Senior middle blocker Jennie Wilson 
proved to have too much energy to contain in 
game five, and the fin:!1 two of her team-high 
15 kills, as well as her leadership on the court, 
pushed the Tritons over the top. Wilson's 
efforts did not go unrecognized. 

"[Wilson] is very key to this team," 
McFarland said. "When she's fired up and

emotional, that just spreads to the team. She 
just wasn't going to let a ball drop, and that 
really made a difference in some big rallies." 

After the game, Wilson recognized the 
crowd for helping her get energized, but she 
also noted that the idea of playing the top team 
in the nation would be more than enough 
motivation for the following night. 

"When you can hear people cheering and 
razzing the other team, and you can see the 

other team crumbling under that pressure, I 
think that's going to help," Wilson said. "But 
when tomorrow rolls around, no one's tired 
anymore. We know [CSUSB's team] so well, 
and all we want to do is beat them." 

Saturday's match proved to be the latest chap-
ter in a fierce rivalry. Long before the first serve 
of the day, any chance of a friendly gathering was

Thirteen-game Triton winning streak is broken 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

After shutting out San 
Franciso State University 2-0 
on Sept. 22, the UCSD 
women's soccer team pushed its 
record to 6-0, and the Triton 
winning streak had reached 13 
games. 

Following that victory, the 
No.2-ranked Tritons went on 
the road to face the Golden 
Eagles of Cal State Los Angeles 
on Sept. 27. 

The Golden Eagles handed 
the previously-undefeated 
UCSD team its first loss of the 
season, 2-1. 

Scoreless after one half of 
play, both teams came out fired 
up for the second half. 

In the 62nd minute of the 
second half, CSULA sopho-
more Diane Garcia headed in a 
goal off a free kick pass from 
fellow Golden Eagle Paula 
Wizel.

I remember the summer just before I came to UCSD, when a couple of people told me 
that this is a boring school. I was 
told that there is little to do except 
join other people and study each 
night. 

Now, in my second year here, I 
still hear students around me 
expressing their disappointment in 
the lack of flavor and excitement at 
UCSD. 

How can people here can find 
nothing to do or stay at home and 
study on a Friday night when there
