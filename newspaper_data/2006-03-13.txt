COURT SCRAPS 
BAN ON 

RECRUITERS 
Justices unanimously 
rule against law 
schools' argument 
that their rights were 
violated. 

By DavidJohnston 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

In a unanimous decision last 
week, the Supreme Court upheld a 
law that cuts off federal funding to 
universities that bar military recruit-
ers from campus. 

The court ruled against an asso-
ciation of law schools, which had 
argued that the law, known as the 
Solomon Amendment, was an 
unconstitutional violation of their 
First Amendment rights. The schools 
contended that barring recruiters 
was an exercise of free speech against 
the military's "don't ask, don't tell" 
policy, which prohibits openly gay 
men and women from serving in the 
armed forces. 

But in an 8-0 decision, written by. 
new Chief Justice John Roberts, the 
court ruled that the law in no way 
violated universities' civil rights. 

"The Solomon Amendment nei-
ther limits what law schools may say 
nor requires them to say anything," 
Roberts wrote in the decision. "A 
military recruiter's mere presence 
on campus does not violate a law 
school's right to associate, regardless 
of how repugnant the law school 
considers the recruiter's message:' 

Furthermore, Roberts wrote that 
because the U.S. Constitution grants 
Congress broad powers to raise and 
support armies, Congress has the 
authority to require campus access 
for military recruiters and it need not 
give schools a choice. 

"It is clear that a funding condi-
tion cannot be unconstitutional if it 
could be constitutionally imposed 
directly," Roberts wrote. 

Although the plaintiff in the 
case, the Forum for Academic and 
Institutional Rights, did not include 
any UC school, the decision will 
have wide ramifications for academic 
freedom and principles, according 
to Ailya Haider, one of the attorneys 
representing EA.I.R. 

"They're asking us to give prefer-
ential treatment to the military the 
same way we treat a nondiscrimi-
natory employer," Haider said. "It 
seems to smack o( something mor-
ally wrong." 

Hundreds of millions of federal 
dollars are at stake. The National 
Science Foundation ranks UCSD first 
in the UC system and sixth in the 
nation in federal research and develop-
ment funding. According to its annual 
financial report, UCSD received $507 
million in federal research awards in

Lease Deal Calms Co-op, University Troubles 
.--By Charles Nguyen 

NEWS EDITOR 

After two years of tenuous nego-
tiations, university administrators and 
campus co-ops have structured a deal 
that gives the stores long-term leas-
es and establishes firm roles for the 
A.S. Council and Graduate Student 
Association. 

The agreement is virtually com-
plete, according to University Centers 
Director and acting Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. 
Ratcliff, and is just awaiting signatures 
from negotiating parties, which include 
the A.S. Council, GSA, University 
Centers and the four co-ops: the 
Food Co-op, Groundwork Books, the 
General Store Co-op and Che Cafe. 

two-year renewal options for the co-
ops. At each two-year period, the A.S . . 
Council and GSA need to certify that 
the co-ops are fulfilling certain tasks, 
according to Kate Pillon, Thurgood 
Marshall College senior senator and 
A.S. representative to the negotiations. 

"Parameters range from .. . fair 
prices [and) fair hours to whether the 
co-ops are educational for the student 
community:' Pillon said. "In the past, 
we've considered the co-ops as teach-
ing tools for students on how to run a 
business, which fulfills the educational 

._aspect. We need to make sure the 
stores are keeping that up, anytime the 
doc.ument is up for renewal:' 

After 10 years, the parties are obli-
gated to return to negotiations, where 
the document would be probed in a 
more in-depth manner, Pillon said. 

"Every document needs to be re-
examined after a decade," Pillon said. 

Pillon presented the new contract 
to the A.S. Council last week, and 
expects counciLmembers and GSA to 
vote on it this week. 

Fi.nding a deal acceptable to all 
sides has been difficult due to a rocky 
relationship between the university 
and the co-ops, according to Pillon. 
In 1992, a judge issued a restraining 
order against administrators, who had 
ordered campus police to break into 
the General Store Co-op to search for 

Food Co-op cashier C7Jris Hagler waits for cUstomers at 1M .",,y, 
to a lease contract with the univemty after two years of often bitter nf!(J.nti~ltial'l.<. 

The co-ops have been operating 
on month-to-month leases from the 
university for over a year, after negotia-
tions turned sour in spring 2004. The 
university demanded concrete changes 
to the Master Space Agreement - a 
contractual document that leased the 
facilities, which then made separate 
deals with the individual co-ops and 
the A.S. Council and GSA - including 
extended renewal periods and new lan-
guage regarding alterations and repairs. 
The original Master Space Agreement 
was drafted nine years ago with a five-
year term, and has since been renewed 
twice for two-year periods.

Millions In

University plans to

ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

In a ruling finding the University 
of California guilty of improperly 
raising student fees, a San Francisco 
Superior Court judge ordered the 
university last week to repay students 
$33.8 million. 

The decision, which affects pro-
fessional-school students system-
wide and undergraduates from UC 
Berkeley, follows accusations by more 
than SO,()()() students that the uni-
versity breached fee contracts in the 
spring and summer of 2003 by taising 
fees without proper notice. 

The university does not consider 
the case to be closed, according to UC 
Office of the President spokesman 
Ricardo Vazquez.

Marshall Students Pass Fee Hike 
By Dora Scheidlinger 

CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

Thurgood Marshall CoUege stu-
dents voted overwhelmingly last 
week to raise the fees they pay to 
their student government, making 
Marshall's the first college compul-
sory fee that allocates a portion to 
those in need of fmancial aid. 

The Thurgood Marshall College 
Student Council's proposal iocreased 
the $2-per-quarter activity fee for 
Marshall students by $4. To relieve 
financial stress for students unable to 
afford the increase, the council added 
a return-to-aid requirement to the fee 
increase, under which 29 percent of 
the increase will be used to provide 
financial aid. 

"Not only did we as students 
initiate the fee, we also took into 
consideration the many students 
who came from low-income com-
munities," Marshall Senior Senator 
Kate Pillon said. "We realize that 
the fee intrease may be a hardship 
and we wanted to make sure that 
it isn't by adding the 29 percent 
component." 

The purpose of an activity fee 
is to provide the college councils 
with the means to fund social and 
academic programs for the indi-
vidual colleges, as well as ali-cam-
pus events. Marshall previously had 
the lowest activity fee out of all the 
UCSD colleges. 

Marshall College councilmem-
bers have pledged to use the fee

increase to expand the coUege's annu-
al music festival, Marshallpalooza, as 
well "Cultural Celebration," a joint 
event put on by the coUege and A.S. 
Council. 

Last year, Marshall students 
rejected a similar fee referendum, 
but the 29 percent return to fman-
cial aid was a unique aspect of the 
two proposals. Other UC campuses 
have already implemented return-
to-aid policies, but t11is is UCSD's 
first compulsory fee that includes a 
financial-aid component. 

On March 9, one day before the 
election ended, Marshall College 
Vice Chair of Finance Geoff Peppler 
announced that 630 students had 
voted, fewer than the 728 - 20 per-

cent of Marshall students - required 
to validate the election. 

Despite the council's concerns, 
827 of the 3,638 Marshall students 
voted in the election, with an over-
whelming 650 approving of the ref-
erendum. There were 158 students 
who voted against the referendum 
and 19 who abstained. 

"The fact that almost 23 percent 
of all Thurgood Marshall College 
students voted and that practically 
80 percent of those voted in the affir-
mative really teUs me that Marshall 
students want more from their col-

lege~ Peppler said.

Young Faculty 

Selected for Prizes 
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation 

has selected two UCSD scientists 
to receive fellowships for show-
ing "the most outstanding prom-
ise of making fundamental contri-
butions to new knowledge.· 

The awards went to computer 
scientist Alin Deutsch and neuro-
scientist lisa Boulanger. Deutsch's 
research focuses on developing 
infrastructure for publishing and 
consuming Internet data, while 
Boulanger studies interactions 
between the body's immune and 
nervous systems. 

Over 500 people are nomi-
nated to receive the prize every 
year, and the fellowships go to 
academics during their first fac-
ulty appointments to help them 
set up laboratories and establish 
independent research projects. 

Cancer linked to 
Chronic Infections 
A UCSD cancer expert con-

firmed last week th e long-he ld 
belief that chronic infections 
are related to th e de ve lopme nt 
of cancer and ha s uggested 
that Ihe connection is a result 
of s pecific genes. 

Michael Karin, a professo r 
of pharmacology, presented 

data that reveals the molecu-
lar nature of the relationship 
between infections and malig-
nant cancers. 

Karin has proposed that 
a particular gene is centra lly 
involved in the link. This gene is 
activated in response to infec-
tion and inflammation, switch-
ing on a series of other genes 
that can cause cancer cell s to 
grow and die. 

Engines Spell 
Dinner for Whales 

A team of UCSD-Ied research-
ers has found that sperm whales 
in the Gulf of Alaska zero in 
on the sound of boat engines 
in order to locate fishing lines 
strung with sablefi sh, their main 
food sou rce and a growing pres-
ence on American dinner tables. 
The endangered whales hone in 
on engine noises as fishermen 
turn them on and off while haul-
ing in their catches, according to 
UCSD-associate research profes-
sor Aaron Thode. 

Sound receivers attached to 
the fishing lines recorded the 
clicks of communicating whales. 
Usi ng the data, Thode's team 
found that whales dive sha llower 
than normal when they a re nea r 
boats in the process of retrieving 
catches of the bottom-dwelling 
sa blefish .

Iy argue its case before a court of 
appeals,' Vazquez said. 

The suit, filed in 2004 by UC 
Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law 
alumnus Mo Kashmiri, affects more 
than 9,()()() UC profeSSional-school 
students - those attending dental, 
medical, law and veterinary schools 
- who were ordered to pay fee 
inc.reases despite promises by the uni-
versity that they would not see fees 
rise while completing their degrees. 

It also affects about 47,000 stu-
dents from the UC system who 
received initial billing statements 
with one outstanding amount but 
who were later sent additional bills 
with higher amounts, which the 
judge ruled to be a breach of con-
tract. 

Jonathan Weissglass, an attorney 

for the plaintiffs, said that he antici · 
pated the verdict and called the 
March 6 ruling a success. 

"It's a great victory for those 
students who were affected;' he said. 
"They will be reimbursed for money 
that they were improperly charged.' 

The judge, James Warren, had 
solidly indicated a ruling in favor of 
the plaintiffs, Weissglass said. 

The university appreciates the 
court's effort, but it does not believe 
that it breached any contracts 
because university policy states that 
fees can be changed without notice, 
according to Vazquez. 

Vazquez said that although the 
university also expected the verdict, 
it would not payout any reimburse· 
ment money until an appeals court 
has had its say. 

"The ruling prevents the univer-

Campus Risks Billions By 
Blocking Military Recruiters 
~ COURT, from page 1 
2003, 81 percent of the $627 mil· 
lion in total research awards UCSD 
facuJty secured. With the recent 
court decision, UCSD wouJd risk 
losing over half a billion dollars 
if it closed the campus to mili tary 
recruiters. 

"The idea that the govern · 
ment can use money to bully 
schools is very troubling~ Haider 
said. "This is not healthy for 
democracy." 

However, UCSD has not 
banned military recruiters from 
campus because they dOll) violate 
university policy, according to 
Career Services Center Director 
Andrew Ceperley. 

"Military recruiters have par· 
ticipated in campus events, such 
as job fairs, in the past, and will 

continue to do so in the future," 
Ceperley said. "As long as an 
employer's hiring practices are in 
keeping with applicable federal 
and state law, the employer may 
participate in university·endorsed 
events:' 

However, state discrimination 
laws include sexual orientation 
in a list of protected traits. UCSD 
policy suggests it favors protec· 
tion for gay students as well. 

According to the Career 
Services Center's On ·Campus 
Interviewing Policy, "consider· 
ation should be afforded to all 
candidates without regard to race, 
religion, color, sex, sexual orienta· 
tion, national origin or age."

justified by the state's budget crisis.

Attacks On the 
Powerless Reveal 
Indifference of 
Young People 

By Maryann Kimoto 
STAFF WRITER 

Theyare everywhere. Americans sitting along the curb, standing by intersections, 
hWlched over on a step. "Notice me~ 
Ihey implore. "I am a war veteran, a 
grandfather, a child. Help:' On occasion 
a local volunteer group will wander 
by, offering snacks and conversation. 
More often than not, they are ignored. 
They are, of courst:. the homeless. 

There are times when attention of 
the wrong sort follows those exposed 
on the street. Violence against the 
homeless is an act of wanton cru-
ehy, and it's been on the rise. For the 
P3st few years, crime rates have been 
recorded by the National Coalition for 
the Homeless (NCH). Alarmingly, the 
perpetrators tend to be young, between 
16 and 19 years of age. San Diego is 
tied, with Los Angeles, as the eighth 
mo t dangerous city in the country 
for the homeless, according to a 2003 
report. 

At tinles, it can be difficult to gauge 
student compassion when troubling 
events surface around the UCSD com-

muDity. The "Jackass" -inspired movie 
"Bumfights" challenges the limits of 
human cruelty, yet has sold hundreds 
of thousands of videos through inde-
pendent distribution. Started by a pair 
of USC and UCLA graduates in their 
early 20s, the film depicts homeless 
people performing stunts, fist fights 
and acts of self-mutilation - all for a 
$20 bill, some food or the guarantee 
of a night spent in a motel The thriv-
ing fan base? High school and college 
students. 

"Burnfights" isn't a distant phenom-
enon. A good portion of the scenes 
in the video were recorded in San 
Diego and one of the filmmakers, Ryan 
McPherson, is a San Diego native. This 
man, who pays others to set their hair 
on fire and slam their heads into walls 
for a cheap thrill, is a peer: in educa-
tion, location and age. 

1\vo Florida teenagers, aged 14 and 
18, kicked a homeless man to death 
last year because "they had nothing 
better to do." In San Diego in 2002, 
off-duty Navy personnel hunted men' 
on the streets with paintball guns for 
sport; and earlier this year, a 3O-year-
old man, asleep in a Boston park, was 
beaten and set on fire by two others. 
Along with the startling popularity of 
"Bumfights:' these incidents show an 
alarming willingness to dehumanize 
the homeless. 

As a student, it i.s easy to learn 
tunnel -vision and concentrate 
solely OLl college life. Study, class, 
friends - it can lead to insulation 
iUld forgetfulness of the world out-
side. Fortunately, the same aspects 
of UCSD that drive students into 
isolated study packs can also teach

ongress and the military have been hiding under the cover of the ambiguous 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy since the Clinton administration enacted it in 
1994, arguing the simple solution doesn't cost that much to enforce. But 
according. to a recent study commissioned by the University of California, 

the first 10 years of "don't ask, don't tell" cost the federal government well over $364 
million in the dismissal of over 9,500 openly gay troops. 

Now that "don't ask, don't tell" has 
proved to be imperfect, pressure is 
fmally on the government to reverse 
this outdated policy. Allowing homo-
sexuals free rein in our armed forces 
is the right thing to do to both bol-
ster our military's enlistment rates 
and uphold the core values of our 
Constitution. But lifting "don't ask. 
don't tell" without first evaluating 
how to best integrate homosexual 
troops into the military could create 
dire consequences. 

Ln other countries, such as 
Britain, Canada and Australia, gay 
troops have been incorporated into 
the military without any great prob-
lems or fanfare. But in the United 
States we need to get used to the 
fact that gay service members, if 
accepted, enhance and strengthen 

our military's core just like any com-
petent soldier does. 

However, if Congress suddenly 
changed course and reversed the pol-
icy, the military's precarious recruit-
ment situation worsen. Straight ser-
vicemen question what - if any 
- special rules homosexuals would 
have to abide by to avoid uncom-
fortable advances. Others worry that 
active servicemembers could feel 
threatened by an influx of gay troops 
and potentially create an unwelcom-
ing place for homosexuals, possibly 
dissuading some from signing up. 

The military is notoriously con: 
servative, and it's not unreasonable 
to expect some resistance to sudden 
change, but the assumptions about 
how straight soldiers would react to 
openly gay comrades are just those: 

assumptions. Where is the evideJ1ce 
that gay soldiers unnerve their fel -
lows so horribly that we must keep 
them closeted? Soldiers might react 
negatively, but they might also not 
care. We don't know which reaction 
any particular service member will 
have, nor whether they would allow 
their reaction to affect their perfor-
mance in the unit any more than 
other inter-unit personal problems. 

In any case, the idea of prevent-
ing eligible men and women from 
serving not because of their qualifi-
cations, but because others might be 
bothered by them, is ludicrous. With 
patience, a military relatively free of 
homophobia is possible. 

While no serious effort has yet 
been made to evaluate how a post-
*don't ask, don't tell" military might 

fare, there have been small advances. 
A new four-volume series on the cul-
tural and psychological dimensions 
of the American military includes 
a chapter on the service of gay 
troops. Titled "Sexual Orientation 
and Military Service: Prospects for 
Organization and Individual Change 
in the United States," the chapter 
details the history and social contexts 
of gays and lesbians in the military. 

The chapter states that many 
homosexuals have been serving in 
the armed furces since World War 
II, and while some were detected 
at induction, they wete often let 
through because of the great need 
for troops. "During the war; it says,

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Ports Controversy· Reveals Prejudices Debate Over Gay Soldiers 
Plagued With Assumptions By Natasha Naraghi 

STAFF WRITER 

To heck with them. . That's the sort of phrase one would expect to hear coming 
from President George W. Bush in 
reference to countries who oppose 
the nation's involvement in Iraq. But, 
surprisingly, this month Congress 
has taken over the president's usual 
duty of promoting intense isolation -
ism. For once it appears the presi-
dent might actuaUy be in the right. 

In Congress' latest muddling 
with Dubai Ports (DP) World's 
acquisition of six U.S. ports from the 

fears are based on a prejudice against 
the Middle East, which will hin-
der any American attempt to make 
peace in that part of the world. 

If members of Congress want to 
talk about security, fine. I say change 
the security measures, rules and reg-
ulations - but don't go out of your 
way to disrupt the economic growth 
ofa company (which paid $6.8 bil-
lion for the lease of u.s. ports) large-
ly because of its location. 

I'm not suggesting we submit 
to the whims of terrorists; rather, if 
security truly is the issue, congres-
sional leaders should continuously 
emphasize the tightening of secu-

rity through the Peninsular and 
Oriental Steam 
Navigation 
Company, it 
highlights a 
distasteful dog-
matism among 
national lead-
ers and under-

The American 
_Utopia 

Coast Guard and 
U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection, 
who are actu-
ally responsible 

scores the common belief by non -
Americans that we're just a country 
full of self-loving, world -ignoring 
citizens. 

Democrats and several 
Republicans raised security con -
cerns over the acquisition, argu-
ing the United Arab Emirates-based 
company could easily lose sight of 
America's interest in protecting its 
people from any possible threats that 
might result from loose security. 

"Our public is very concerned 
about a foreign country, in this case 
specifically a foreign country from 
the Middle East, having a major role 
in our ports~ said Representative 
Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.). 

Keep in mind, however, that the 
company was not previously owned 
by an American enterprise but rath-
er an English one. Furthermore, sev-
eral Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese 
and Danish companies already own 
or lease American ports. Thus safety 

for American port 
safety, not individ-
ual companies. 

Otherwise, the government is 
just promoting nativism at its worst. 

Members of Congress, however, 
are not the only ones blatantly sup-
porting a nativist rationality. In a 
recent poll, the Washington Post 
found that 46 percent of Americans 
"have a negative view of Islam," 
43 percent "reported having heard 
negative remarks about Arabs," 
and ·one in four Americans admit-
ted to harboring prejudice toward 
Muslims, the same proportion 
that expressed some personal bias 
against Arabs." 

Negative views like these, which 
stem from the nation's nativist 
attitude, produce several unfortu-
nate external costs, especially for 
America's universities. The decline 
in the number of international stu-
dents highlights this notion and 
indicates that the Dubai ports con-
troversy is onJy one example of the 
nation's prejudices prodUcing unex-

pected effects, including decreased 
diversity at colleges. 

According to the Institute of 
International Education, during 
the 2003 -04 school year, the United 
States experienced a 2.4 -percent 
decline in U.S. of international stu-
dents studying at the nation's uni-
versities. California, which hosts the 
greatest number ofinternational stu-
dents, saw a.4-percent drop, which 
amounts to almost 3,000 students. 

This decrease, however, is 
hardly as frightening as the sug-
gested causes for the decline, which 
include "real and perceived dif-
ficulties in obtaining student visas 
... rising U.S. tuition costs, vigor-
ous recruitment activities by other 
. English -speaking nations," and 
my personal favorite, "perceptions 
abroad that international students 
may no longer be welcome in the 
U.S." 

While the level of international 
students at UCSD actually increased 
from 1.607 to 1,811 during the 
2003-04, according to the UCSD 
International Center, the national 
decrease outweighs the small suc-
cess of one University of California 
school. Furthermore, an expansive 
education requires a global under-
standing and tolerance. That is , 
after all, the entire point of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College's Making of the 
Modern World general education 
requirement. 

This cannot be accomplished, 
however, only on college campuses. 
The nation as a whole must promote 
global understanding, not only in 
the Dubai ports situation, but in all 
aspects of politics. -

And so I say, to heck with 
Congress and all this ado surround-
ing the Dubai ports. Americans 
need to take it upon themselves to 
be a more tolerant people - and 
we can do this while keeping our 
security intact. 

~ MILITARY, from page 4 
scientists noted that many homosex-
ual soldiers functioned as effectively 
as their heterosexual counterparts:' 
But for decades these findings were 
ignored because they represented "a 
minority view that conflicted with offi-
cia! policy. Official policy at the time 
did not disallow officials from directly 
asking about a soldier's sexuality, and 
that was so for the same reason we 
hear today: Gay troops hurt morale. 

The new chapter in the series 
"Military Life: The Psychology of 
Serving in Peace and Combat" is a 
small but important first step in the 
process of integrating homosexuals 
into our military . 

Creating an equitable environ-
ment, which would allow homosexual 
service members to contribute at their 

full potential, will take time even if 
the rosiest of predictions about the 
tolerance of straight troops are true. 
Like other times of great social change, 
things will happen more slowly than 
many activists would like. 

The Iraq war and our various other 
overseas commitments are creating a 
desperate need for more troops. Some 
might insist that this reality should 
preclude a new policy change that has 
might degrade troop morale, as critics 
charge including open homosexuals 
will do. But in times of war, when 
every able man and womlii'i is needed, 
it is insulting to the inteUigence and 
maturity of our soldiers to believe they 
wouldn't choose to have more trained 
comrades to back them up over the 
assurance that at least the ones allowed 
in aren't gay. 

The Homeless Deserve More 
Compassion and Civility 
~ HOMELESS, from page 4 
on the good morals of empathy and 
proactive community service. 

Thurgood Marshall College offers 
a minor in public service, with which 
students can take coursework about 
community and education, and later 
serve in internships and as tutors. 
With 28 units, a student gains not 
only a minor, but a chance to shape 
the outside world. 

UCSD professional students have 
also taken steps toward learning 
more about San Diego - they've 
started the UCSD Student-Run 
Free Clinic Project. Students from 
the health fields offer their services 
pro bono to the uoderserved of San 
Diego, and the program, though only 
10 years running, has been popular 
enough to spark an offshoot program 

for dental needs. Undergraduates are 
encouraged to commit a year of vol-
unteer service, though popularity on -
campus is probably weakened by the 
program's off-site locations, which 
require personal means of transport a-
tion. The importance of the program 
is not in convenience for would-be 
volunteers, but rather the sheer need 
for such a service. 

in affluent La Jolla, it is easy to 
lose oneself to the impersonal luster 
of business complexes and the core 
commercialism of nearby malls. But 
UCSD students need to remain alert 
to the plight of those people outside 
the bubble of campus. Opportunities 
abound to reach out to the San Diego 
community, both its- rich and poor, 
and students ought to take the initia-
tive and lead the way.

TO WORK OR 
NOT TO WORK 

From interchangeable work hours to earning 
just above minimum wage, students voice their 

opinions of working on campus. 
By Marnctte Federis 

ASSOCIATE FOCUS EDITOR 

W hether it is driving a shuttle or tutoring, handling campus mail or shelving books, the variety of on-campus jobs is as color-ful as student interests. There 
are those who value their jobs for the money and 
others who are more interested in flexible hours or 
work that is relevant to their career goals. A survey 
of students employed on campus conducted by the 
Guardian found that students are generally pleased 
with the their on-campus jobs. The survey also 
found that students are unhappy about low salaries, 
while interest in job duties varies by department. 

The survey asked student workers from top on-
campus employers about overall satisfaction with 
their jobs relating to work environment, supervisor 
management, scheduling flexibility, adequate pay 
and the perceived importance of their positions. 

About 300 students replied to the survey. While 
the "adequate pay" category received lower scores 
for aU departments, the overall satisfaction of on-
campus jobs is evenly high throughout the sample 
pool. . 

According to Career Services Cent!!r Director 
Andy Rabitoy, the high scores were not surprising, 
since on-campus jobs have always had high levels 
of job satisfaction. 

UCSD Bookstore, Business and Financial 
Services and UCSD Libraries received high scores 
for management treatment and work flexibility. 
However, respondents were less enthusiastic when 
asked whether their job is important or challeng-
ing. 

At UCSD Libraries, scores were lower for ques-
tions regarding the importance of the job and 
whether it is challenging or relates to their inter-
ests. Student worker positions at the library include 
shelving books or assisting in book, video or audio 
checkout. UCSD Libraries respondents also gave 
lower scores for pay satisfaction, with an aver-
age of 3.4 out of a possible five, and a 3.6 average 
response for the question "my job is the best job 
for students ." 

Earl Warren College senior Clara Robles said 
that because her job at the music, film and video 
reserves does not require much work, lower pay is 
acceptable. She was also surprised that respondents 
said that they do not have enough time to study. 
Robles checks out audio fLies in the reserves and is 
allowed to read or study while on duty. 

"Where I work, I can study for classes," Robles 
said. "The job doesn't take up much time. The pay 

could be better with all the student jobs, but for the 
work that we do, it's pretty OK:' 

UCSD Bookstore also received lower scores in 
pay and importance, but received the highest score 
offive in the work environment category. Bookstore 
employees who participated in the survey work as 
cashiers, stock shelves and assist custom~rs . Revelle 
College senior Joshua Kim, a cashier, said that the 
flexible hours are mostly why he applied. 

"The people here are friendly and understand -
ing when it comes to scheduling ," Kim sa id. "( 
would recommend this job to people who want 
some extra cash. It's an easy job, but if you really 
need money, you're not going to get paid enough to 
cover your expenses." 

Student workers at Business and Financial 
Services find their jobs less challenging. Most of 
the respondents from this department were from 
Mail Services. Warren junior and Mail Services 
worker Prisci lla So said the lower scores for her 
position do not surprise her. So works at the par-
cel pick-up window underneath Sierra Summit in 
Muir College. 

"It's a pretty boring job:' So said. "But it's com-
fortable and it's close to the cafeteria." 

The Guardian received the highest numbeI of 
respon ses from the recreation department and 
Transportation & Parking Services. These students 
echoed others' concerns - their jobs are not chal-
lenging, and pay is low, but students were drawn in 
by flexible hours. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Miranda 
Bowersot'; who has been working at RIMAC since 
her freshman year, is not surprised by the su rvey 
results for recreation. 

"It's definitely not high-paying, but there's 
enough time to study, it's on campus and was one 
of the positions that ( looked at as a freshman ," said 
Bowersox, a supervi or at the equipment rental 
window. 

While respondents from RIMAC and 
Transportation & Parking Services are not as chal-
lenged by their jobs, they are also not complaining 
about them. 

Revelle College senior Brian Daniel works as 
a campus-loop shuttle driver and recommends it 
despite the long driving hours. 

"Driving for six hours gets kind of mundane, 
but you get used to it:' Daniel said. "It works out 
really nice because you can shift your schedule 
around with other drivers.' 

Despite low!!r scores for aU departments in 
the "adequate pay' category, Rabitoy said that

THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS 9 

Good Work Environments Float Job Satisfaction 
• • WORK, from page 6 many students still see the overall benefits of working at on-campus 

jobs. Additionally, he points out 
that there was a raise in the salary 
range for student wages on campus 
starting in February. Other raises 
were also approved for the next two 
years. 

"The reasons that many students 
opt for on-campus jobs include mak-
ing contact with professors for gradu-
ate school, or future graduate school 
recommendations, convenience with 
class schedule, lack of transporta-
tion and cost of gas," Rabitoy stated. 
"There are a variety ·of positions on 
campus that teach different skill.s and 
levels to our students." 

Respondents from the Office of 
Academic Support and Instructional 
Services, Academic Computing 

Services, Early Academic Outreach 
Program and the biology depart-
ment said that they saw their work 
as important, challenging and inter-
esting. These departments also 
scored high in the work environ -
ment category. 

O.A:S.I.S. Student Coordinator 
Colleen Roy, who directs the student 
mentors of the Academic Transition 
Program, said the pay was "decent" 
and the working environment very 
relaxed. Most of all, Roy cherishes 
the tight-knit group that she and her 
fellow student employees maintain. 

"It's a family type of environ-
ment; Roy said. "Everybody who 
works here are friends." 

According to ROY, many of the 
students who work at O.A.S.I.S. 
have been part of various O.A.S.I.S. 
programs such as Summer Bridge 

and continue to work as tutors or 
mentors. 

"It's like contributing back to 
what was given to us,- Roy said. 

Roy, a biochemistry major, also 
noted that though she enjoys her 
job, it does not necessarily indicate 
her career path. 

Earl Warren College junior Carlo 
Alvear. an aerospace engineering 
major who works as an academic 
transition coordinator in O.A.S.I.S .• 
agrees. 

"[The jobl drew me because it was 
a way for me to help students," Alvear 
said. "It's helping me flOd a space on-
campus to do work but enjoy what 
I'm doing."

UCSD to Work Toward 2007 • VOI.LEYBAI.L, from page 12 UCSD's.l11 in game one andeventu-

ally winning 20-30. 
Pepperdine jumped to a 5-10 lead 

with eight kills and no attack errors 
in game two. The two teams traded 
points until UCSD pulled within two 
at 13-15, forcing the Waves to call a 
time-out. Pepperdine came out of the 
rest aggressively, going on a 6-3 run 
and forcing the Tritons to call one of 
their own. UCSD could not put a run 
together and lost the game 22-30. 

The Tritons raced in front in 
game three, scoring seven of the first 
10 points on three kills from senior 
opposite Brenden Bowe. Their 7-3 
lead would slowly disappear, how-
ever, as the Waves came back to tie at 
IS- IS. UCSO kept Pepperdine from 
taking the lead for a little while, but 
the Waves would not be stifled forev-
er. Pepperdine went on to score three-
straight points to take their fll'St lead 
of the game, 23-24. UCSO's comeback 
effort came too late as the Waves went 
on to win the final game 27-30. 

The Tritons were outmatched by 
the Waves in many aspects of the 
game, but being outblocked 13.0-5.5 
proved to be their major downfall. 

"We can't let teams get through 
[our blocking), especially with Joe 
[Sexton) out of the back court: soph-
omore middle blocker John Mark 
Wendler said. "He's our captain ... and 
we work better as a unit when he's on 
the court." 

The previous night. the Tritons 
battled hard with USC, but to no 
avail,losing 28-30, 24-30 and 29-31. . 

USC had S.S blocks and held 
UCSD to a .068 hitting mark in the 
opening game. but the Tritons kept it 
dose with 18 ties between the teams. 
With the score tied at 26-26, two 
Trojan kills, including one of senior 
outside hitter Joao Grangeiro's 12 in 
the match, and a Triton service error 
ended the game at 28-30. 

USC took a 15-13 lead in game 
two thanks to an impressive ,333

that role, draining a three-pointer 
with one minute, 40 seconds left that 
brought the Tritons within one at 55-
54. Unfortunately for the Tritons and 
Buffum, her heroics were upstaged as 
the Falcons answered right back with 
a clock-beating three-pOinter from 
guard Mandy Wood that gave Seattle 
Pacific another four-point lead. 

Wood's basket sucked the momen-
tum away from the Tritons, who 
would never make another serious 
challenge to the Falcons. 

"It's just so frustrating when you 
know you really beat yourself; Hinga 
said. 

Though the Tritons didn't man-
age to pull off a tournament run in 
the end, their overall season is not 
one that will be forgotten, as many of 
the girls broke records and garnered 

top honors. Juster's conSistently supe-
rior play earned her the MVP award 
in the CCAA as well as the Daktronics 
Division-II West Region Player of the 
Year honor. She also broke the all-time 
UCSD scoring record with 1,311 career 
points, 595 of which came this season. 

"We are disappointed anq dev-
astated that our season is over, but 
then, you sit back and shed your 
tears and reflect on the season and 
feel so proud of where you've come: 
Buffum said. "We were the only ones 
to believe in ourselves and surpassed 
all our critics' expectations. We had 
a tough conference compared to 
others, and faced nationally ranked 
teams. Our season shows we g~ve 
it our all .... We may have been cut 
short in the end, but we have come a 
long way and things can only go up 
for us from here:' 

Softball Ends Losing Streak 
With Narrow Sweep of Otters 
• SOFTBALL, from page 12 
losses. 

The Coyotes had no trouble cre-
ating offense as they continued to 
rack up runs against the Tritons 
in game two, leading 2-1 after two 
innings. 

In the bottom of the seventh, 
the Tritons were still in striking 
distance, down three runs at 4-1, but 
UCSD only managed to score once 
more in the game, 

UCSD actually out -hit the 
Coyotes eight to four in the loss, 
thanks in part to two hits apiece 
from juniors Nikki Palmer and 
Dallas Hernandez. Second baseman 
Hernandez: scored the only two runs 
in the game for the Tritons, while 
catcher Palmer and freshman out-

fielder Alljson May earned the lone 
RBis. 

In the second game, freshman 
pitcher Lauren Chastain fell to 1-
3 on the year after giving up fou r 
runs on 10 hits in the complete 
game performance. Chastain came 
into the game holding an ERA of 
8.48, and will see it fall despite the 
losing effort. 

Next up for the Tritons, the team 
will travel to Riverside to face Cal 
Baptist. which boasts a perfect 25 -
o record, for a doubleheader on 
March 15. Then the Tritons will 
head into a four-game league road

fifth -straight win.

The UCSO men's tennis team's 
initial struggles appear to be over. 

The No. 14 Tritons have bou nced 
back from a challenging schedu le 
that led to an 01 6 start, posting 
their fift h-straight win overall with 
a victory over the Fresno Pacific 
Univer ity Sunbirds on March 9. 

The Tritons, now 5-6. started 
the day off with a 3-0 lead over the 
Fresno Pacific, showcasing nearly 
perfect doubles play. Standout per-
formances came from the No. 1 
doubles team of sophomore Blake 
Meister and senior Erik Oijala, as 
they defeated opponents Robert 
Bianco and Marco Foelz by a score 
ofS-5. 

UCSO's No. 2 duo of seniors 
Brent Molden and Steven Oechal 
posted a huge 8-1 win over Anthony 
Zafiris and Victor Medina of Fresno 
Pacific to continue the Tritons' dou-
bles domination. The No. 3 pair, 
sophomores Kazumi Negishi and 
Eric Rubens, completed the dou-
bles sweep with an 8-4 win over 
Fresno Pacific's Kyle Kropf and Greg 
Jackson . 

"I think we did so well in dou-
bles because we were at home and 
had the whole team cheering for 
us, which helps a lot:' Oechal said. 
"We're competing at a higher level 

every match." 
The Sunbirds, however, man-

aged to fare slightly better in singles 
action, winning three of six match-
ups to scare the Tritons before they 
clinched the victory. 

After No. 1 Molden did his job 
beating his Sunbird opponent 7-6, 
6- 1, the rest of UCSO's singles play-
ers gave Fresno Pacific a chance in 
the match. 

No. 2 Rubens fell to Fresno 
Pacific's Foelz 6-7, 1-6; No. 3 Meister 
lost to Zafiris 2-6, 0-6 and No. 4 
Oijala dropped his matchup against 
the Sunbird's Bianco, 3-6, 6-7. 

Despite taking an early 4-0 lead, 
the Tritons witnessed the Sunbirds 
work their way back to 4-3, put-
ting the pressure on Megishi and 
sophomore Ramesh Thondapu to 
win their respective matches. 

No. 5 Negishi needed an extra 
set to take out Medina, but came 
through with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory 
at the end of the third et. Negishi's 
win clinched the victory for the 
Tritons, taking the pressure off of 
Thondapu, who promptly defeated 
Jackson 6-3, 6-1. 

Head coach Eric Steidlmayer was 
very happy with the players' perfor-
mance. 

"They have come a long way in 
their competitiveness," he said. 

However, Steidlmayer also said 
that he's looking ahead. 

"We have a long way to go if 
we are going to truly chaUenge as 
a national contender:' Steidlmayer 
said. "It is my hope that the players 
really take it upon themselves to 
examine their games and search for 
raj way to improve." 

The Tritons will look to maintain 
their winning streak as they take on 
Sacramento State on March 14.

No.3 Waves crash on

It's been 40 days, 12 matches and 36 
games since the UCSO men's voUeyball 
team tallied a win. . 

Though the Tritons showed signs 
of breaking out of their funk, they 
once again failed to earn their first 
victory in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, lOSing two league games 
in straight sets to No. 14 University 
of Southern California and No. 3 
Pepperdine University on March 10 
and March II , respectively. 

After falling to USC in the first 
game of their road trip, the Tritons 
traveled to Malibu to face the Waves 
and fell 20-30, 22-30, 27-30. 

The loss dropped UCSO to 1-19 
and 0-15 against MPSF opponents, 
while the Waves improved to 12-4. 

In game one, senior opposite Chris 
Sayers' 15 kills kept the Tritons within 
reach at 8-9. Sayers also· led the Tritons 
with his .296 hitting efficiency in the 
game. After two sideouts, Pepperdine 
scored five-straight points to take the 
lead for good. The Waves had their 
way the rest of the game, hitting .500 to

Revitalized Offense Sweeps CSUMB Women's Basketball 
Upset With Early Exit By Lauren KaLo STAFF WRITER 

Heading into the toughest sec-
tion of its 2006 schedule, the UCSD 
softball team ended its four-game 
lOSing st reak with back-to-back 
wins over Cal State Monterey Bay 
on March 12. 

After losing their two-game 
series against Cal State San 
Bernardino on March 8, the Tritons 
(15-10 overall, 6-4 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association) 
were in dire need of a win when 
they came to face the Otters at 
RlMAC Field. 

Head coach Patti Gerckens 
attributed the pressure in the 
games to UCSO's offensive prob-
lems against CSUSB. 

"We've just gone through some 
rough weeks due to distractions 
that have prevented us from hit-
ting the ball the way we want to," 
she said. 

The first game, originally sched-
uled for March 7 but postponed 
due to rain, ended in a 5-3 UCSD 
win after senior Jenny Spencer and 
sophomore Jenny Maze sparked 
the offensive outburst with home 
runs and two RBIs apiece. 

On the hill, sophomore ace 
Melissa Ward was her normal dom-
inant self, earning the win with her 
three-run , four-hit, complete game 
performance. Ward truck out six 
Otters while walking only two in 
the win. 

Sophomore pitch er Nicole 
Fullerton did her best job to foUow 
Ward's gem on the mound as she 
went 5 l/3 innings in the second 
game, allowing two runs on five 
hits. 

Se nior shortstop Desiree 
Franciscus' one-hit , three- RBI 
effort provided Fullerton with aU 

the offense she needed to take care 
of the Otters. Junior outfielder 
Brittni Carino added another hit 
and RBI in the 4-3 win. 

Gerckens complimented her 
team's focus in the important wins. 

"In today's game I saw a much 
more focused team like the one 
from the beginning of the season," 
she said. 

The Tritons came in to the games 
against the Otters with added pres-
sure from lOSing their previous four 
games. The last two losses came 
against Cal State San Bernardino 
on March 8 as the Triton offense 
failed to put any sig-
rallies together.

Rios, who gave up only one walk 
and no hits in the 2-0 shutout.

No.4 seeded Tritons 
bow out in first round 
of D-II Tournament to 
No.5 Seattle Pacific.

The road to glory was cut short 
for the UCSD women's basketball 
team on the Western Washington 
University campus, as the Tritons 
saw their Division-II National 
Championship hopes dete.riorate in 
a 62-57 loss on March 10 to No. 5 
Seattle Pacific University. 

Though favored to win as a No. 4 
seed, the Tritons could not perform 
at the level of play that gave the'1l the 
best record in program history and 
earned them national recognition. 

The Tritons, ending their season 
with a 23-5 record, prepared them-
selves for the pressures of the playoffs. 
However, some players felt that they 
prepared too much and that the loss 
came from overcompensating for the 
nerves they felt over the important 
game. 

"When you sit in a hotel room for 
two days in Washington, and the only 
thing you're thinking about is the 
game Friday night, it can be emotion-
ally draining," said California College 
Athletic Association Most Valuable 
Player and junior guard Leora Juster, 
who managed a game-high 2 I points 
and team-leading seven assists, nev-
ertheless. "You just don't play too 
many games where if you lose, it's all 
over. It's just do or die, and it's harder 
to stay focused [onl your rhythm 
with that in your head." 

The first half of the game was 

unusual, as the teams, both of which 
pride themselves on sharp shooting, 
combined for 1 8-of-68 shooting from 
the floor. Both teams had nine field 
goals in the first half, with the Tritons 
needing 37 attempts and the Falcons 
only 31 to hit nine shots. The Falcons' 
more efficient shooting led them to a 
four-pOint lead at intermission, forc-
ing the Tritons to rethink the game 
plan to improve upon the cold shoot-
ing iii the first half. 

Junior guard Kim Buffum rec. ~­
nized the funk her team seemed to be 
trapped in. 

"Anything happens on any given 
night," she said. ·Some swoop and 
some fall, but it is not characteristic 
of us to shoot that badly, especially in 
the first half." 

Her teammate, junior forward 
Brianna Hinga, who made 16 points 
and added a game-high 14 rebounds 
for the Tritons, felt that her team 
might have been holding back a bit. 

"We came into the game super 
excited, which made our playing a 
little jittery;" Hinga said. "Being too 
anxious caused the loss of shots. We 
never went out and took charge of the 
game like we normally do. To be hon-
est, we were playing a bit timidly." 

After a good halftime talk from 
first-year head coach Janelle Jones, 
UCSD move4 away from the first 
half's chaotic atmosphere. The game 
was much more evenly matched in 
the second half, with five ties between 
the teams. 

The Tritons found themselves 
in need of a hero, down by four 
points with less than two minutes 
left. Buffum did her best to fulfill
