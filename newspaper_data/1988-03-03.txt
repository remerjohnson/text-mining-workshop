Restraining fJfder kills bill 
By ELAINE SMOLER 
Stll// W,it~, 

Due to "its ambiguous word-
ing," the A.S. bill which prohib-
its campus newspapers from 
printing after Friday of the ninth 
week of each quarter was over-
ridden by a temporary restrain-
ing order issued by the Judicial 
Board. 

to be aware of that," said collec-
tive member of the New Indica-
tor Chris Ehric. 

Representatives from the New 
Indicator believe that the Judi-
cial Board must also base its 
decision on the U.S. Constitu-
tion, namely, the First and Four-
teenth Amendments. They don't 
think that in order to have a rul-
ing based on the U.S. Constitu-
tion they have to go to a federal 
court. 

everybody's out of here. So I felt 
that wasn't money well spent. 
Students wouldn't have access to 
those newspapers," Marchick 
said at the hearing. 

"It took six days to get the 
paper back [from the printers]," 
Ehric said at the meeting. This 
was an unusually long period . 
They expected the paper to come 
back within a couple of days and

Comnt students 
organize rally 
By SUSIE BEEL 
Arts Editor 

Communication students ga-
thered Wednesday afternoon to 
organize their plan of action in 
approaching the administration 
regarding student desire to in-
crease their involvement in the 
department. Approximately 50 
students attended the informal 
meeting, held outside the com-
munication department, which 
included a videotape of seniors 
discussing their frustrations in 
dealing with the department. The 
tape also offered some sug-
gestions in resolving problem 
that students feel have existed 
for too long. 

Among the problems discu sed 
in the meeting were the long lines 
that communication students are 
forced to wait in to register for 
classes. While other seniors had 
the option to use the T-Reg 
process for spring quarter, com-
munciation students were unable 
to use the system, the given 
explanation being that the com-
muncation department's com-
puter did not interface with tfte 
registrar's computer. It is unclt.'ar 
how the T-Reg process will affect 
these lines in the future . 

The students also suggested 
creating a peer advisor group, 
whether paid or voluntary, which 
would help pre-communication, 
as well as communciation stu-
dents . The group would function 
as a resource center. "Those who 
have gone through the process or 
are late in the process are very 
familiar with all the steps, what 
is required , what's not required, 

what you can and cannot get 
into, and what you should and 
should not get into, and that is 
one of the most important things 
- to have some guidance," said 
Jim Torres, a communication 
student involved in organizing 
the meeting. Greg Griffin is the 
only advisor for communication 
students, who number around 
800. 

The students also voiced con-
cern about their lack of control 
over faculty reta inment. Visiting 
professors at UCSD do not have 
tenure , and the administration 
doe not have to offer them a 
full-time position with their de-
partment. The main goal of most 
visiting profe sor is to get on the 
tenure track . Therefore, when 
these professors are not offered a 
full-time position, they are forced 
to move on . A Lisa Askin , 
another organizer, said, "What 
the irony is, is that these are the 
professors that the students really 
likl~ . . . and the man who is in 
charge of the visiting faculty with 
creating tenure track , to my 
understanding, is the Dean of 
Social Sciences." I n light of the 
shortage of professors in the 
department, the students feel that 
the e quality professors should 
be retained . 

A seat on the review board 
that hires professors is another 
goal that the students hope to 
acquire because it would increase 
their input into the hiring pro-
cess . "Is this university a busi-
ness , or does it want to promote 
learning? It doesn't seem that it 
wants to promote learning be-

See MEETING, pale 2 At its first hearing of the school 
year the Judicial Board heard 
the complaints of the New Indi-
cato, collective regarding Bill 
151. The collective claims that it 
is unlawful and is confusing 
because it's not specific as to 
whom is affected by the bill and 
when it will apply. 

At the hearing A.S. President 
Dave Marchick responded to the 
charges. "Tht! whole issue of First 
Amendment rights I don't think 
really applies here because of the 
fact that the A.S. is the publisher 
of these newspapers. So we can 
say 'when the papers can print 
and when they can't print with 
student activity money .. . they ' 
do have the right to print as indi-
viduals, as an organization." 

UCSD grofessor 

During the hearing, Steve 
Weinberg, chair of the Judical 
Board, took a stand on the 
Board's responsibilities. "Please 
understand that the Judicial 
Board's jurisdiction is over the 
A.S. constitution and its bylaws. 
We will formulate ou~.decisions 
based on those documents and 
no others," Weinberg explained. 

"This bill could very well pre-
sent a violation of the First 
Amendment and you might want 

David Marchlck 

Last night at the A.S. meeting, 
a new wording of the same 
Amendmer,t to the Media Board 
Charter was expected to be sub-
mitted under Items of Immediate 
Consideration. However, this 
change was withdrawn from the 
agenda by Marchick . 

Member of the New Indicator 
believe that they have. been tar-
geted by some members of the 
A.S . council because of the poli-
tical content oftheir paper. Since 
the New Indicator is the only 

pap~roncampus, historically, to 
print and distribute during finals 
week, they I'dt that this bill was 
created specifically to censor 
their paper. especially since it is 
close to the new A.S . election .

Kripke 
Continued from pale 1 
psychiatry at UCSD School of 
Medicine, and director of the 
sleep disorders clinic at the V.A. 
Medical Center adjacent to 
UCSD . 

Kripke, who was recently u-
nanimously endorsed by local 
Democratic leaders, feels he may 
have a better chance in 1988. 
"1986 was ... a very poor year to 
oppose Republican representa-
tives," Kripke said . "It's very 
well known that congressional 
candidates often win on the 
second or third race," he con-
tinued. 

Kripke began by 
literally 'standing up' 
"for education, health 
care, for women's 
rights, and ... hon-
esty." These issues 
seemed to form the 
core of Kripke's po-
litical platform. 

Kripke made his announce-
ment from the living room of his 
La Jolla home near UCSD. Five 
reporters sat on a sofa and chairs, 
listened to his inital remarks, 
and then asked questions. 

He was generally very critical ' 
of the Reagan administration 
and the incumbent he is chal-
lenging, Republican Bill Lowery. 

Kripke began by literally 'stan-
ding up' "for education, for 
health care, and for women's 
rights, and . . . for honesty." (This 
was a tactic recently employed 
by former Democaratic presiden-
tial candidate Bruce Babbitt dur-
ing a nationally televised debate.) 
These issues seem to form the 
core of Kripke's political plat-
form ; they were certainly the 
ones he talked about most on 
Monday. 

J n the quiet, tranquil subur-
ban setting, Kripke answered the 
reporters' questions calmly and 
evenly, but with feeling. It was 
obvious that he cares about the 
issues he was discussing. 

"Reagan and his allies have 
been wimps in the trade area," he 
said while discussing the trade 
imbalance. "We must reverse our 
economic decline." 

He also discussed social issues, 
expressing his support for free-
dom of choice in the area of 
abortion. Kripke cited data 
showing that the majority ofthe 
district shares his stance in this 
area, and charged that "the

incumbent has voted against 
abortion every time, "even to save 
the life of the mother. 

One of Kripke's main issues in 
1986 was his charge of wrong-
doing by Lowery, and he is con-
tinuing this theme in 1988, Kripke 
claims that Lowery has taken 
illegal contributions, even though 
the Federal Elections Commis-
sion recently failed to convict 
Lowery of such charges. 

At one point, Kripke reached 
into a bowl of fortune cookies 
silting on the coffee table be-
tween him and the reporters, 
broke ope!! a cookie, and read 
the fortune aloud . "It says 'Trust 
him, but keep your eyes open,"' 
Kripke said - an apparent ref-
erence to the issue of honesty 
(Examination of the' fortune 
cookie revealed that Kripke had 
been in earnest). 

He was also critical of the 
administration's record on 
environmental issues, saying, 
" I'm a strong supporter of coas-
tal protection." 

His tone was not as harsh on 
some issues which the adminis-
tration has favored, however. "I 
support the lNF treaty," he said, 
referring to the accord signed by 
President Reagan and Soviet 
leader Gorbachev. "I would also 
like to see the admirtstration 
support a--test-ban treaty," he 
added. 

Regarding Central American 
policy, Kripke was again quite 
critical. "The administration has 
been supporting drug pushers," 
he said, referring to the U.S.-
backed Nicaraguan Contras. 

When questioned further 
about his campaign in 1988, 
Kripke revealed that he has not 
yet raised any contributions, nor 
does he have any campaign staff. 
In response to a question, he 
stated that in 1986 he spent 
"about $75,000" of his own 
money on his campaign. He 
would not say whether he would 
do the same in 1988. 

Kripke was generally upbeat 
about his chances this year, 
however, and felt that he did 
"very we\1" in 1986, though he 
did not win. "I'd like to thank my 
friends at UCSD for their sup-
port," he added, referring to the 
fact that he had won the UCSD 
precincts in 1986. 1m

The New Indicator collective 
has filed charges against Steve 
Tauber, A.S. commissioner of 
communications, claiming that 
he did not hold Media Board 
meetings, in which representa-
tives from the alternative media 
are ex-officio members. They are

May helQ solve some ~ast crimes 

Two thieves arrested 
in Central Library 

By JOHN SHAW 
Tramm, D/r~clor 

Campus police arrested two 
non-student males Monday at 
Central Library on charges of 
burglary and possession of stolen 
property, a UCSD police ser-
geant said. 

Randy Johnson, 28, and 
Eugene Glover, 23, were arrested 
at I: 15 pm for allegedly stealing 
three wallets in the library and 
possessing a videocamera be-
lieved to have been stolen from 
Scripps Hospital45 minutes ear-
lier, Sergeant Bob Jones said. 

Several library employees say 
they saw Johnson steal a wallet 
from a staff member's desk and 
search through a nearby file 
cabinet in a restricted "staff only" 
room on the ground floor . 

Library supervisor Nancy 
Beale was alerted to the theft and 
consequently locked the main 
doors to prevent Johnson from 
escaping. 

When campus police arrived, 
they questioned johnson and 
learned that Eugene Glover was 
waiting for him outside the 
library. Glover was questioned 
and his vehicle searched for evi-
dence . Police found a S 150 
videocamera matching the des-
cription of a videocamera stolen 

from Scripps Hospital at 12:30 
pm. 

Shortly after the suspects were 
arrested , a student reported the 
theft of her purse from the fifth 
floor. Anotherstaffmemberalso 
reported the theft of her wallet as 
well. Two of the wa\1ets were 
recovered in the library, however 
the $65 in one of them was 
missing. 

Glover and Johnson were each 
charged with one count of bur-
glary and one count of posses-
sion of stolen property. Bail was 
set at S7,000 each. They are 
scheduled to be arraigned today. 

Thirty-seven cases of miscel-
laneous theft, including waIlets, 
purses, and backpacks, were 
reported in campus libraries dur-
ing 1987. Twelve of those thefts 
were in Central Lib:ary. 

According to Sergeant Jones, 
police are conducting an investi-
gation to determine if Johnson 
and Glover are responsible for 
any of these thefts. Detectives 
will have to go through each case 
individuaIly to see if any suspect 
descriptions or physical evidence 
match up to the suspects arrested 
Monday. 1m

4 Thursday. March 3. /988 

Hunter S. Thompson 
Boy George Returns 

Ye gods, that evil one has come back from the dead . Boy George live and the next time you want to get rude with The Com-pany, Sport, you better be sure you have all the manhole 
covers welded down . 

Bush came into Manchester with his tail between his legs and the 
whole weight of the national media like a millstone on his neck ... He 
was ready to fail, a lame wimp with trouble ahead and trouble 
behind . The ice president was dead in the water if he lost New 
Hampshire. He would go to Super Tuesday in a wheelbarrow. 

So he called in his people, and they came. It was like the Alamo all 
over again. Even Barry Goldwater rode into town laughing and 
snarling and jabbering that John Wayne was right behind him ... If 
George is a wimp, he is a very functional wimp, and during 25 years in 
the belly ufthe system, he had made some very functional friends. He 
has been the vice president of the United States for seven years; he 
ha been chief of the CIA; he has been national chairman of the 
Republican Party; he has been ambassador to China and a congress-
man from Texa ... That i a lot of IOUs for a man on the brink of 
political extinction to call in , all at once. 

George did not want to lose this one. And neither did Sen . Bob 
Dole, R-Kan ., who was "riding high on the hog" - as they say out 
there in Iowa - after flogging Bush in Des Moines and then 
shrewdly worrying him to death in Manchester ... George laid back 
on the ropes and did his Wimp Thing with a straight face, taking a 
relentless beating in the process .. . He was in b.ad trouble , they 
said ... 

But Dole was like Larry Holmes. He had no right hand , no killer 
instinct, no whack to the brain when it mattered ... And a beautiful 
jab will not make it in this league . Not against a genuinely nasty 
counterpuncher like George, and not with the rigidly perverse elector-
ate in New Hampshire. Even good guys will cheat when the stakes 
are so high that the winner will be the most powerful man in the 
world. Maybe. . . . . 

I n any case, those freaks have done it again, and it scorched the 
eyebrows off a whole gang of wizards like me and Pat Buchanan, 
who dismissed tiush early on along with hi~ old buddy, AI Haig, who 
rolled high and 10 t in ew Hampshire. He will never again be 
employed inside the Beltway that wraps around Washington like a 
noose, and most of George Bu h's people live co mforta bly inside it. 

Other live across the river in Virginia. along the shady two-lane 
blacktops that lace the chic Virginia suburbs around McLean , where 
the only local industry i the headquarters of the CIA, a vortex of 
extremely heavy energy where anything - repeat, anything - is 
possible, and some things are absolutely necessary. 

M eanwhile, out in California , a maniac sex brute of some kind was running amok in Sunnyvale and terrorizing the whole Silicon Valley with what seemed, in the news, like 
more ordnance than Ollie North sold to the Ayatollah . It was a sign 
of the times : massive retaliation against anyth ing that gets in your 
way, or even makes you grind your teeth at night. 

T he only real meaning of George Bush's big victory in New Hampshire has to do with the fate of Bob Dole , who lost his edge and tarnished his gunslinger my tique to the point where it 
might prove fatal. Jack Palance didn't miss . 

The TV people turned on him savagely. When Larry King asked 
right-wing columnist Bob Novak if Dole had "blown" New Hamp-
shire, ovak replied that Dole had not only blown New Hampshire, 
but also the nomination ... Which is probably true. Dole needed New 
Hampshire, if only because nobody who failed to win here has ever 
made it to the White House ... Winning is no guarantee, but losing i . 

The crowd will be noticeably smaller by the time the train leaves 
for Dixie and Super Tuesday. The eccentrics and special pleader will 
be gone - except for Jesse and the Preacher Robertson , and they are 
both likely to win big enough in the South to force both conventions 
in to a second ballot. And maybe a third or a fourth. 

Why not? It's about time we had some fun in this wretched little 
business . If the '88 election put Larry Bird against Magic Johnson for 
the presidency, voter turnout would j ump to 77 percent. A lot of 
people who "gave up" on politics in the great malaise of the '70s , as 
noted by Dr. Patrick Caddell, would get back into it. 

And if enough of them voted , they might finally get a presi dent 
that they might even recognize as one of their own.

Sexism in 
Grad School 
Editor 

The quotation attributed to 
me in "Status of Committee 
Forms"[ Guardian. Feb. 29] may 
be misconstrued as a comment 
on my personal ituation. 

In fact, the proper context for 
these remarks is much broader. 

My comments about the 
inhospitality of the campus cli-
mate for graduate women were 
based upon a number of studies, 
both national and local , which 
show that females in graduate 
school often face institutional-
ized attitudinal barriers to ob-
taining success in their fields. 
A 1986 report by the Association 
of American Colleges notes that 
these barriers "are part and par-
cel of our usual ways of relating 
to each other as men and women, 
and are so 'normal' that they 
may not be noticed." 

An in v rmal poll of UCSD 
graduate women from many dif-
ferent departments produced 
comments on the local situation 
ranging from "there's an Old 
Boys' Club from which women 
are excluded" to "the shortage of 
female mentors worries me" 
(UCSD's 14 percent female to 
male faculty ratio at the begin-
ning of the year wa~ one-half the 
national average offemale faculty 
on staff) . 

I n addition to these attitudinal 
barriers, such institutionalized 
obstacles as a shortage of affor-
dable child care, non-recognition 
of two career couples in a profes-
sion that demands frequent relo-
cation , lack of adequate mech-
anisms to handle sexual harass-
ment issues, no standard policies 
for fair pregnancy lea"e, and 
inequities in re earch and teach-
ing funding hamper female 
graduate students' productivity 
and advancement. 

As one of the nation's top 
research universities , UCSD 
prides itself on setting precedents 
in many fields . As an educa-
tional institution, it ought to be 
setting precedents in incorporat-
ing women into the workforce. 

Clearly, the problems hinder-
ing women graduate students at 
U CS D are a magnification of the 
problems hindering women in 
the workforce all over the United 
States . Women are now an inte-

Shame on 
'Guardian' 
Editor: 

In the editorial, "Shame" 
[Guardian, Feb. 29], UCSD is 
reprimanded for not "recruiting" 
blacks. "We, as a group are 
racist," we are told. I think this 
editorial is an insult to black stu-
dents at UCSD. 

Why does "Shame" consider 
blacks as unequal students? 
Afro-Americans (or ethnic code 
1t3 on UC applications) have the 
same ability to excel in high 
school as whites (ethnic code 1t2). 
It would be racist to assume 
otherwise. 

Coming from an ethnically 
diverse high school, I had friends 
(EC 1t3s) who felt insulted by 
people who believe they need 
special help to get into college. 
My years in Pasadena taught me 
that the only difference between 
races is the color of the skin. 

Is it acceptable to complain 
about the large amount of 
Asian-Americans entering the 
UC schools? Many who are 
over-qualified are turned down 
each year. Using "Shame's" 
meaning of the term, lhis can be 
construed as racism. 

I don't think the UC system 
should rely on a system of ethnic 
code numbers to create a magi-
cal balance of the races. This is 
not the real world . I do not 
appreciate being erroneously 
referred to as a racist be<;;luse I 
am a student at UCSD. 

Coming to U CS D was a major 
change from my high school. I 
agree that there is racism on 
campus, the kind I have never 
experienced before. This i sick-
ening. However, the low percen-
tage of blacks is not t he effect of 
no "recruitment." It should be 
proved that the administration is 
trying to keep blacks out of the 
University before the finger is 
pointed at racism.

Procedure 
Editor: 

The UCSD Undergraduate 
Affairs / Special Services Office 
is currently in the process of 
revising university policy imple-
menting the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act 
(FER PAl . The most important 
changes to take place, as far as 
concern student rights, are the 
extension of time allocations for 
the university to act on student 
grievances and the elimination 
of the student's right to a hearing 
before a Hearing Committee over 
alleged violations of the act by 
the University.

the work done by some indus-
trio~s students in thc past to 
insure that students have a fair 
proc(dure to follow when their 
privacy rights are violated is now 
wasted because of lack of general 
student concern over such mat-
ters . Student input is required 

whenever the university makes 
changes to its policies affecting 
students. While the university is 
not obliged to follow student 
opinion, it can make a difference 
if it is strong enough. 

Anyone interested in making 
their concerns heard over the

changes in UCSD FERPA policy 
should voice them to Connie 
Morrison of the UCSD Asso-
ciated Student Government or 
directly to Nicholas Aguilar, the 
director of U A/ Special Services, 
B-009, UCSD, La Jolla, CA 
92093. Bard-Alan Finlan 

The new policy implementing 
FER PA will be contained in the 
University Policy and Procedure 
Manual as PPM 160-2, and will 
allow a student with a grievance 
to have a hearing only before a 
Hearing officer who will be a 
university employee to be ap-
pointed by the Vice Chancellor 
of Undergraduate Affairs. The 
same vice chancellor makes the 
finaJ decision on the student com-
plairn based on a report from the 
Hearing officier. 

cedure, this is the better' way to 
go as far as the student grievant 
is concerned. The hearing before 
a Hearing Committee is simply 
more fair to the student con-
cerned . Since it is not in the best 
interests of the university to rule 
against themselves over a student 
allegation of violation of the 
privacy act, it is very unlikely 
that they will make it a practice 
to rule in the favor of the student 
making such a complaint. 

Reagan/Hitler Comparison Frightening 

The option for a hearing before 
a Hearing Committee, as is cur-
rently allowed for in university 
policy implementing FERPA, 
allows the students to have their 
grievances heard before a group 
consisting of university staff and 
faculty members, as well as 
student representatives from stu-
dent government and one person 
of the grievant's own choice. 

In my opinion, based on my 
own experience with this pro-

In my experience with UCSD 
FERPA grievance procedure, 
even though I had letters from 
the United States Department of 
Education telling the university 
that they were in violation of the 
privacy act, the university still 
would not admit fault in the 
matter. Just to get the university 
to follow its own Rublished pro-
cedures in handling the matter 
has been difficult and sometimes 
nearly impossible. 

The elimination of the stu-
dent's right to a Hearing Com-
mittee over alleged FERPA vio-
lations is a step in the wrong 
direction. It would be a shame if

The commotion surrounding 

your Hitler / Reagan political 
cartoon [Guardian, Feb. 18] has 
gone far enough. In response to 
this cartoon, Kevin Kelly shot to 
the President's defense. Wasting 
no time at all, Adama Dyoniziak 
struck back with a scathing at-
tack on Reagan's policies and 
"attitudes. " 

Honestly, the focus of these 
letters scared me. How can such 
educated individuals - especially 
Dyoniziak, whose parents lived 
in World War II in Poland - so 
readily accept comparisons 
between Adolf Hitler and Ronald 

Reagan? They seem to have let 
their political fervor impair their 
vision of history. 

I am no great supporter of 
Reagan's policies or his politics, 
but I would never attribute to 
him (or to Mikhail Gorbachev, 
for that matter) the unspeakable 
atrocities for which Hitler is 
responsible. Hitler - of all his-
tory's leaders - is the only one 
to systematically kill for the 
accident of birth, exterminating 
people only because of their her-
itage, sending chiJdren to their 
deaths for the beliefs of their 
parents: hardly comparable to 
Reagan's jingoistic rhetoric.

Calling the comparison 
between Reagan and Hitler 
simply a "lie," as Mr. KeJly did, 
only serves to perpetuate the real 
problem; by merely defending 
Reagan, you elevate Hitler to 
legitimacy. Hitler and the Holo-
caust must be remembered for 
what they were, not a common 
"charismatic politician" and his 
"hatred of Jews." If a newspaper 
such as the Guardian continues ' 
to take references to Hitler and 
the Holocaust lightly, we are 
doomed to see their horrors -
not just "the tone of their ideas" 
and "nationalistic propaganda" 
- again and again.

Border Patrol fights losing battle? 
By DAVID BROOKS 

tal! Writ'" 

While many tudents at UCSD 
are finishing a day of classes, 
nearly an hour outh and a world 
away. thou ands of oon to be 
undocumented aliens are prepar-
ing to cross into the United 

tates. On a ny given e ening, 
hund red ot suc h people can be 
plain I seen " staging" - border 
patrol jargon for making plans 
to enter the nited tate . They 
an iously await the cover of 
darkness to allow for safe pas-
age north . 

On first viewing, .. taging" 
appears to be nothing less than a 
biz.arre game. Illegal aliens po i-
tion themselves under the watch-
ful eyes of U .. Border Patrol-
men . This area , known as " the 
levy" to illegal immigrants and 

.S. Border Patrol , is in reality a 
no man's land. Although " the 
levy" is in the United States, the 
border patrol makes no effort to 
disper e the trespassers , who 
often taunt a nd throw rocks at 
the border patrolmen . The 
agency lacks the manpower to 
arrest. process and eventually 
release the myriads of undocu-
mented aliens seeking entry at 
this point. 
Rising number or aliens enterinc 
the U.S. 

The United States is fighting a 
losing baltle against illegal 
immigration . The statistics for 
January of this year have already 
been processed . These new fig-
ures reveal that significantly 
more Mexicans and Central 
Americans have migrated north 

illegally in 1988 than last year. 
The an Diego area Border 
Patrol, which i re ponsible for 
66 mile of the border, arrested a 
record 53.711 aliens last month . 
This number is up 13 percent 
fro m January 1987. The weak -
ened Mexican peso. the violence 
in Central America, combined 
with the prospect of California 
agriCUlture jobs, has re ulted in 
an ever-rising influx of illegal 
aliens . 

One of the Border 
Patrol 's main goals is 
to "process" the il-
legal aliens as quickly 
as possible. It is not 
unheard of for an 
agent to arrest the 
same alien twice dur-
ing an eight hour 
period . 

The border patrol depends on 
the most basic as well as very 
high-tech equipment to aid them 
in enforcing the border laws. 
Their first line of defense is rather 
benign: the seemingly far from 
effective border fence. Neither 
electrical nor barbed wire, this 
fence appears more appropriate 
for separating tract homes than 
countries. Recently, the border 
patrol was forced to dig three-
feet deep trenches adjacent to the 
fences to prevent smugglers from 
smashi ng their cars through it. 

Up to seven illegal al iens wil l be transported at one time in border 
patrol vehicles such as thiS Ram Charger. 

For most aliens entering the U .. , 
the fence presents few problems. 
The huge holes cut through the 
wire fence are evidence of this. 

Once the alien step into the 
United States, however, the 
border patrol uses ophi ticated 
equipment to trac k illegal aliens. 
The rugged hill ides and ca nyons 
along the border are constantly 
surveyed by helicopters or fixed-
wing aircraft. Additionally , 
motion detectors and pressure 
sensors are placed along traveled 
trail . T he locations of these 
detector are known only by the 
border patrol who move them 
often . 

Perched atop a hillside over-
looking "the levy" sits the border 
patrol's most valuable piece of 
technology . It is known to the 
border patrol agents and the ille-
gals simply as "the scope". This 
"scope" - a Vietnam era track-
ing device - picks up heat waves 
emitted from people and vehicles 
and translates this heat into an 
image . Hidden from site and 
with a radius of over 5 miles , the 
border patrol is able to keep a 
surprisingly close watch on 
crossing aliens. The challenge 
for the scope operator comes in 
carefully directing agents to the 
aliens by radio. 

Vehicle check polnu 
The Border Patrol's job does 

not stop at the border . I n an 
attempt to prevent illegal aliens 
from traveling north to Los 
Angeles and other large cities, 
there are a number of vehicle 
check points in Southern Cali-
fornia . Many people are familiar 
with the checkpoint on 1-5 in San 
Clemente. To the untrained eye, 
it can appear as if the agents 
randomly allow some car to 
pass while detaining others. 

Thi process of picking out 
illegal aliens and / or mugglers is 
far from haphaz.ard; it is a calcu-
lated process combining psych-
ology with other "markers" to 
determine who is stopped and 
who is allowed to pass. Agents 
look carefully at older cars and 
especially va ns . These on the 
spot determinations are so suc-
cessful that the San Clemente 
checkpoint is usually forced to 
close every three hours to allow 
for the processing of hundreds of

Ace the final's 
stress test 

By KA TV SMITH 

That horrible time of year is 
upon us once again, finals are 
just around the corner. Here 
are some hints to help you 
keep your sanity and make 
the grade. 

What is STRESS! 
Stress is the body's natural 

response to a physical or 
psychological threat. During 
a threatening situation the 
brain signals the body to pre-
pare to fight or to flee. This 
theory has been labeled the 
fight or flight response. For-
tunately, most of us students 
choose the fight response 
during exams! 

Stress causes eye pupils to 
grow larger , hearing to 
become more acute, muscles 
to tense, and the heart rate to 
increase. It can also cause 
blood to be diverted from the 
skin and extremities to the 
brain and hean . Stress has 
also been shown to lower anti-
body levels, which makes one 
more susceptible to a cold, the 
flu , or even tooth decay . 

During exams stress often 
causes students to develop 

interesting study habits. One 
of these is a demand on the 
body to study 25 hours a day 
and replace sleep with large 
doses of caffeine. 
Caffeine; the 100 percent na· 
tural replacement for sleep! 

As UCSDstudents, most of 
us have attempted to "pull an 
all nighter" and replace those 
necessary REMs with some 
kind of caffeine drink. This 
will most likely get your cen· 
tral nervous system over-stim-
ulated and elevate your stress 
level. 

A dose of caffeine above 
any individual's tolerance level 
can lead to side effects such as 
tremulousness , ex.treme ner-
vousness, chronic muscle ten-
sion, rapid heartbeat, and dif-
ficulty falling asleep and / or 
sleeping soundly . Caffeine 
also decreases the amount of 
oxygen availa'ble to the brain . 

It does not take an enor-
mous amount of caffeine to 
cause these dects. Some esti-
mate that the lethal caffeine 
dose for a healthy adult man 
is about 10 grams, the same as 
80 .. 100 cups of coffee. How-
ever, the effects of caffeine

IN 
TOWN! 

By CHRISTINA HUIZAR 
Guardian Intern 

"I have no idea" seems to 
be the most common 
response st udent s offer 

when asked, "What is that large 
industrial-looking building be-
hind USB?"One overly imagina-
tive tudent even responded, 
" You mean that place they take 
the st udents caught cheating?" 
Another suggested that is was "A 
nuclear power plant." 

The building In question is 
located near the Che Cafe on 
Revelle campus - it's the one 
with all the pipes and tubes com-
ing out of it with steam spewing 
from its top. 

The Central Utility Plant is 
part of the I'~ysical Plant Servi-
ces and is headed and overseen 
by Mort Shayegan. But what 
does it actually do? The typical 
student response to thi~ question 
was "I don't know." What actu-
ally goes on inside is not so 
mysterious. 

The Central Utility Plant is 
comprised of boilers which 
generate steam used for heating 
a large part of the campus. There 
are also water chillers which util-
ize the steam for cold water in 
climate cooling. This grey mon-
strosity houses compressors 
which, surprisingly enough , 
compress the air to be used in 
control systems and in some high 
pressure air laboratories. A back 
up system with energy supplied 
by SDG&E will take effect in the 
event of an emergency shut-
down. The plant also runs on 
natural gas for economic reasons 
but at times is also run on fuel 
oil. 

"There is absolutely nothing 
harmful about the Central Util-
ity Plant," Shayegan said. 
Nothing except its appearance 
that is. Students' reactions to the 
building's appearance ranged 
from "ugly" and "dark, dank and 
isolated," to "industrial." One 
student passing by the building 
went as far as to say, "Disgust-
ing, it looks as if they tried to 
hide it behind all those trees and 
they were unsuccessful." Another 
student, also passing by, stopped 
to comment, "The other day I 
saw some guy out there washing 
the windows and I thought, why? 
There is no point to it." 

"Disgusting. It 
looks as if they tried 
to hide it behind all 
those trees and they 
were unsuccessful." 

-UCSD student 

However ugly it may be, the 
Central Utility Plant is essential 
to the university. It supplies 
Revelle campus, Muir campus, 
the School of Medicine and Cen-
tral Library with energy. There 
are separate utility systems in 
other campus housing units. At 
Scripps, each building has its 
own utility system. The 10 main-
tenance operators who control 
the Central Utility Plant do so 24 
hours a day, 365 days a year. 
Some students also work there , 
doing "clean-up" jobs. The actual 
plant is run by the maintenance 
operators. 

The Central Utility Plant has 
been around since the university 
opened its doors in 1961 and it 
will be around for a while yet. 
After all, when the plant huts 
down , so does the university. [QJ

Though the bulk ofthe border 
patrol operates in the Southern 
California area, the agency also 
has small (often four agents or 
less) outposts along the Cana-
dian border. Unlike their coun-

the agents on the Canadian 
border concern themselves with 
only preventing drug smuggling. 
The agents in the Southwestern 
United States have a considera-

One of the border patrol's most 
important functions is to keep 
illegal drugs from entering the

Veal, the agency confiscated 2.5 
tons of marijuana and 3,800

Border 
Patrol 
Continued from pale 8 
Crimes Prevention Unit. This 
unit, composed of both San 
Diego Police officers and Border 
Patrol agents, marks the first 
time that a municipal and a fed-
eral agency have consistently 
cooperated together. 
Distinluishinl illegal from legal 
residents 

In an area with a Hispanic 
population as large as San 
Diego's it would seem difficult 
for agents to distinguish illegal 
aliens from legal residents . This 
is not necessarily the case, ac-
cording to seasoned agents. The 
Border Patrol looks for people 
wearing dark clothing (aliens 
tend to believe that light clothing 
will make them stand out more). 
Shoes are also looked at care-
fully. More often than not, an 
illegal alien will have dirtied or 
wet shoes from crossing through 
brush or the Tijuana River. 
Additionally, agents tend to stop 
only those headed north. 

At this point, if they are ille-
gal, the aliens will run (dubbed 
the "dash for the cash") or allow 
themselves to be arrested. Most 
aliens give themselves up with no 
resistance, even when there is 
only one agent attempting to 
stop a large group. Agents 
attribute this passivity to the 
immigrants' inherent fear of law 
enforcement due to experience 
in their native countries. Accord-
ing to Agent Tom Acosta, many 
of the people from Latin Ameri-
can countries are accustomed to 
brutal police officers and are 
shocked to find the U.S. agents 
and holding accomodations so 
different. 
can Federal Police must deter-
mine a deportee's nationality by 
his / her dialect . Those who are 
"OTM's" (other than Mexican) 
are not allowed to enter Mexico. 
As a result, the United States 
takes back and detains Central 
and South Americans for several 
days. 
Double crossln& the border 

One of the Border Patrol's 
main goals is to "process" the 
illegal aliens as quickly as possi-
ble. This means that from the 
time an illegal alien is arrested, 
taken to the holding facility, and 
deported to Mexico, usually no 
more than eight hours has 
elapsed. In fact, it is not unheard 
offor an agent to arrest the same 
alien twice during an eight hour 
period. 

The actual deportation pro-
cess is not always simple. The 
Mexican government only ac-
cepts deportees at certain even-
ing hours, usually when few 
tourists are entering. In addi-
tion, the Mexican Federal Police 
at the border accept only those 
who are Mexican nationals. Since 
many of the deportees do not 
carry identification, the Mexi-
can Federal Police must deter-
mine a deportee's nationality by 
his / her dialect. Those who are 
"OTM's" (other than Mexican) 
are not allowed to enter Mexico. 
As a result, the United States 
takes back and detains Central 
and South Americans for several 
days. 

Upon viewing the U.S. / Mex-
ico border, one needn't be an 
immigration expert to see that 
aliens are crossing in record 
numbers. Agent Acosta ex-
plained further that "as long as 
people [~outh of the border) are 
hungry, they're going to keep on 
cros ing." rID

Staff Write, 

Despite being plagued by an 
assortment of early-season injur-
ies, the top ranked women's ten-
nis team has jumped out to a 7-3 
record while going undefeated 
against Division III competition . 

The team's only losses have 
been to Grand Canyon College, 
a top NAIA squad (7 games to 
2), and California State Long 
Beach, a strong Division I team 

(7-2). The first two matches were 
played without the team's No. I 
seed Christine Behrens. In the 
last match, which took place 
Saturday afternoon, the Tritons 
played without their No. 4 and 5 
seeds, Susan Mitchell and Janet 
Whalen. 

Each of the players - Behrens, 
Mitchell and Whalen - have 
missed a number of matches due 
to injury . That has left other 
players such as Julie Berman (8-
2 record), Susan Carney (7-2) 
and Kristen Diels (8-1) to pick

a very good job. Already the 
Tritons have won some very 
important matches. They beat 
Occidental College, who finished 
second in the nation behind 
UCSD last year , 8-1 without 
Behrens and they defeated 
Pomona-Pitzer, which has had a 
good chance to reach the NCAA 
Division III tournament this year 
with an 8-1 record. 

Coach Liz La Plante is excited 
about the Tritons bid to repeat 
as national champions and said, 
"We haven't had a full lineup 
playing in a long time but we've 
still been playing very well. We 
have a great group of girls who 
are motivated and willing to work 
hard. That's why we're winning 
so much . Hopefully the rest of 
the season will be as successful 
and we will continue to play well 
in the second half of the season." 

The team looks to have a real 
good c hance to repeat. Although 
it lost three of its top six players 
from last year's championship 
squad, the girls who replaced 
them are equally strong. They've 
already beaten two of the top

Football tackled by A.S., athletic dept. 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

For the second time within a 
two year period, a referendum 
may appear on the Spring 
ASUCSD election ballot which 
would fund an intercollegiate 
football team. 

The referendum proposes a 
$15 increase in student fees to 
accommodate expenses with the 
addition of a football team to thc 
atheltic program as well as ex-
panding the budgets of the 22 
existing intercollegiate teams. 

An athletic department study 
completed last quarter recom-
mended that$IOofthe$15 fee be 
allocated to the football team to 
pay for operational costs as well 
as staffing, uniforms and insur-
ance. The additional $5 would be 
allocated to the existing inter-
collegiate teams. 

Currently, the study says, the 
university'S approximately 400 
athletes pay for most of their 
preseason expenses . 

A similar referendum cam-
paign last year, which called for 
an increase of $6.50 in student 
fees in order to simply add a 
football team to the athletic 
program, was plagued by con-
fusion and differences between 
the students involved and the 
administration. 

According to the athletic de-
partment's research, the $6.50 
requested last year would not 
have been nearly enough to fund 
the immediate introduction of

football without depleting the 
funds of the other intercollegiate 
teams. Consequently, the athletic 
department did not support the 
fee. 

"This year , all interested par-
ties have participated and 
reached an agreement on what is 
appropriate," said UCSD Ath-
letic Director Judy Sweet . 

"There has been no disagree-
ment on costs and other benefits 
of the referendum. Our assess-
ment fee allows football to be 

run as well as other Division III 
school's, while permitting our 
other !eams to operate at an 
improved and more realistic level 
as well," Sweet said. 

"We've [taken] into account 
that start-up and operational 
costs for football are greater than 
any other intercollegiate sport," 
said Bill Gannon, UCSD's sports 
informat ion director. 

"Through this research, we 
have determined that a SIS fee 
will provide the necessary funds 
to realistically operate a football 

program as well as add much 
needed support to our athletic 
teams," Gannon added. 

The addition of a football 
team, Sweet says, will produce 
other benefits for the athletic 
department . 

"With football, the department 
must enlist additional training 
help as well as increased sports 
information services, services 
which will remain to assist the 
other teams as well. ,. 
No limes for two years 

Should the referendum pass, 

the department would have to 
wait at least one year before the 
football team would be ready to 
participate in regularly scheduled 
games. 

"Two years would allow us to 
fulfill all equipm~nt needs, find a 
coach and sta ff an d simply get 
organ iz.ed , .. S weel said . 

The team might practice infor-
mall y next year, po ibly cul-
minat ing in a blue and - gold 
intrasquad game. 

Actual games against other 
sc hools will depend on openings 
in their schedules. 

" Most football schedules are 
don e two or three years in ad -
vance," Gannon said . "From the 
point that we announce the sta rt 
of our football program, there 
will be a lapse of time before 
other colleges have open dates 
on their schedules. " 

The primary student force 
behind the referendum, Warren 
Junior Senator Cris Rys, is an-
ticipating success. "I j ust hope 
the students remember that the 
legislation did pass last year but 
was not put into effect because 
not enough s_tudent voter 
showed up," Rys said. 

"This referendum is a student 
initiative," Sweet said. "The stu-
dents must now make the de-
cision as to whether or not they 
want a football team at UCSD." 
Should the referendum pass, the 
athletic department will then 
"take the responsibility to do it 
right." [Q)

The game was a pitchers' duel

Nowak, while still throwing

Along with their No . 5 rank-

The Tritons' chances of win-
ning a national championship 
this year and for many years to 
follow are very good. This year's 
team is sending more individual 
swimmers (35) to the Nationals 
than any other school that is 
competing. Coach Morgan enthu-
siastically said, "We are a very 
young team and the future looks 
bright. There are a lot of fresh-
men and sophomores on this 
team and they will have the 
opportunity to experience what 
few people can, a national

some very important meets

56 Triton members have par-
ticipated in three meets so fa r . 
San Diego Sta te U nive rsi ty 
hosted the fir st eve nt , wit h 
UCSD, Occidental and US Inter-
national University participat-
ing . The meet was not scored but 
several runners made exceptional 
appearances, including long-dis-
tance runner Merrel Hora, who 
won the men's 2-mile race. 

The second meet was an open 
meet at Pomona-Pitzer. Triton 
Kevin Carter won the 1500 yard 
race in 3:58 and Tim Vallez won 
the 800 in I :55. both "good t imes 
for this early in the season," 
according \0 head coach Mark 
Stanforth. High jumper Chris 
Arantz also won his event with a 
6'6" leap. 

Last weekend , the Tritons par-
tici pated in a triangular meet 
with Point Lorna-Nazarene and 
Redlands University a t Point

Stan fo rth . " Right now there are 
a couple of inex perienced people

insisted, "We made him look 
tough, always getting behind in 
the count and having to swing at 
their pitches." 

Finally, in the bottom of the 
ninth, Hubel began to tire and 
the once-dormant Triton offense 
mounted a last-ditch rally which 
culminated in a two-out, bases 
loaded, two-RBI single by de-
signated hitler Kevin Gelbart , 

However, this was a close as 
the Tritons would get, as Hubel 
managed to snuff out the rally, 
getting Erik Jud on, in his first 
at bat of the season, to ground 
out to second, sealing his com-
plete game and first victory of

The regular season IS over and now 
it's lime for the second season to begin. 
Just like the NBA. 1M hOopsters live for 
the playoffs. Game day turns the happy· 
go· lucky UCSD gym rat Into an Intense. 
bloodth irsty Wild animal who would 
elbow hiS own gra ndmother to get a 
rebound Every game IS a pressure 
cooker and keeping the lid on tight Will 
be a key to playoff SUCCeSS 

Thi s year could be the year that the 
big man can make a big difference Hav· 
ing one or two guys who can push, lean, 
shove, elbow, rebound, and shoal for 40 
minutes Will probably be the key to suc· 
cess, Getting down and dirty in the 
trenches sure Isn 't much fun · but If the 
Job doesn 't get done you Just can't win . 
The big man Will have a big Impact 
Teams with the big man have a big 
advantage, teams without may be

The ac tion begins on Sunday and 
wars Will continue through the week with 
the finals the follOWing Sunday on the 
full court with hundreds In the stands. To 
get to the championship game takes a

The champions crowned on Sunday the

playoff tournament In 1M sports. 

The second Ingredient is the shooter. 
With the three pOint line a shooter 
becomes the prime time player. He can 
dig you out of a hole In a hurry, or put

SOCCIR CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WEEKEND 
MEN'S AAA 

I will stick with my original pick In thiS 
game, Rocket IIodI to win It all . How can 
you pick aga inst Rod CramM, Mr. tM 
Soccer? These guys are peaking at lust 
the right time. Their last game was a 8-0 
rout of the supposedly good FruH Salad 
team Rommel and Kappes c ouldn't keep 
up with the mighty Goodman and Cramblit. 

The championship game is actually 
being played in the semis beet ween Rocket 
Rods and the surprising Juventu. team. 
JUventus won the AA title last year and 
weeren 't supposed to be a factor thiS 
year, but led by Cra ig Gross, they 
have been outstanding In rou ting their 
competition. 

Don't Meg WHh U. megged all the lime 
and IS too old to even conSider to win II all. 
They used 10 good, though. GenHeman'.

"Black people need no 
apology for their color, the 
history of black people is of 
great kingdoms that have lasted 
for five centuril!s. It is very 
valuable and important for 
young blacks to know that 
they have a long history of 
knowledge and depth," Dr, 
Jack Kimbrough is speaking 
0(, as well as listing, a life that 
has been subject to racism, 
and subject to apologizing for, 
instead of celebrating, his her-
itage. Kimbrough stood among 
his collection of African art in 
the Grove Gallery, surrounded 
by art that symbolizes the 
energy and richness of black 
culture. It is through the depth 
of black culture that he gained 
the strength to smash the ster-
eotype of blacks, to recover 
the bounty of black history 
and to add to it. 

One of Kimbrough's con-
tributions to black history 
includes loaning the Grove 
Gallery his private collection 
of rare African artifacts. San 
Diego's first black dentist is 
sharing the art to heighten 

awareness of its symbolism 
and depth. The extensive pri-
vate collection spans areas of 
Africa with pieces from Sierra 
Leone, Guinea, Northern 
Liberia, Eastern Africa and 
the Ivory Coast, The exhibit 
consists of a variety of wooden 
masks and totems, ivory carv-
ings and bronze figures 
representing African proverbs, 
The most intriguing aspect of 
the exhibit, according to its 
collector, is the symbolism 
inherent in African art, "Afri-
cans were carving ideas and 
symbols for themselves in 
abstract art. From generation 
to generation, the art expressed 
its ideas through the use of 
symbols, not through written 
language." 

Some of the most promi-
nent symbolism is phallic. For 
example, ancient carvl!d 
Mende stonl!s that were made 
during thl! 13th through thl! 
15th centuries were buried in 
the ground as a tribute to 
"mother earth ," Kimbrough 
relates the pil!ces to the magic 
of resemblance; the phallic 
symbols resemble fertility and 
wl!rl! uSl!d to promote fl!rtile 
fields . Also rifl! with symbo-

OF AFRICA 

lism, as well as reflecting the 
complex understandings 
Africans have of the world, 
are the bronze figures repres-
enting African proverbs. A 
glass case is filled with minia-
ture figures acting out truisms 
of life. Also based on the 
existence of everyday life is an 
untitled, intricately carved 
elephant tusk. The ivory 
depicts men, women and 
animals all searching for food 
under the shelter of the uto-
pian African skies, beautifully 
symbolized by a graceful can-
opy of palm tree leaves. 

Another piece that reflects 
the African way of life is the 
terracotta funerary figure from 
the Upper Volta . It is a strangt; 
stone carving with human feet 
on the ground, hands reaching 
to the sky, and an upside-
down head resting on the fig-
ure's stomach . At first glance 
this is just a bizarre image, but 
Kimbrough explained that the 
piece is a memorial for the 
dead, and the head is positi-
oned to always face the 
heavens . 

Three terrifying figures dd-
initely not facing the heavens 
are entitled "Firl!spittl!rs," 

They are metal works that 
resemble animal heads with 
accentuated mouths mounted 
on human forms. Historically 
the figures represent the cus-
tom of cleaning a tribe of evil. 
The huge mouths were to carry 
red hot coals to spit out, there-
by purging the members of 
evil. Another figure that dealt 
with evil is the protective fig-
ure from the Senuf tribe 
located on the Ivory Coast. 
The figure is very unique in 
that it is completely wrapped 
in burlap and the face is totally 
hidden. Coming out of its 
head are eagle feathers; the 
figure is made distinctive by 
the presence of a single ex-
tremely long arm. Thl! figure 
represents a tribal member that 
has committed a tribal tabu . 
The eagle feathers represent 
the keen eyes of the eagle that 
are able to spot the evil tribe 
member under the cloaks of 
lies, 

Racism is an issue in Kim-
brough's life, and by sharing 
his art collection, and more 
importantly, his conception 
of the rich depth and knowl-
edgl! of black people , racism 
will hopefully become a his-

torical element that once 
I!ffected blacks. Kimbrough's 
presence also serves another 
purpose; hc is a mentor, and a 
role model for young blacks, 
He represents strength, intel-
ligence. social mobility, and 
generosity. The exhibit from 
the collection of Dr. and Ms. 
J.J. Kimbrough remains until 
March 19. 

The I!xhibit offers many 
visually invigorating artifacts, 
including a multitude of masks 
and figures collected by Kim-
brough over the last 30 years, 
He is almost 80, and has spent 
about 6 months in Africa. The 
inspiration to begin collecting 
art goes back to Kimbrough's 
past when he began collecting 
books. Reading Booker T . 
Washington made me realize 
that I was as good as anyone 
else." it is very important to 
the collector that people know 
that black history, culture, and 
art has been historically 
repressed 'along with black 
people. By acknowledging the 
art and the dl!pth of the black 
culture, the oppression can be 
put in the background, and 
blacks can feel good about 
their history.

Elvis Christ has successfully

Annie 
shot 
live 

by phil macgovern 
hiatus writer 

1 have never been able to 
enjoy concert movies. The first 
one that I saw, "Urgh, The 
Music War," was cool because 
back then it was Punk Rock, 
but 1 fell asleep. Along with 
most of my generation, I saw 
the Talking Heads movie, 
"Stop Making Sense," yet I 
failed to see the magnetism of 
David Byrne. These films have 
never ceased to bore me. The 
EurythmicS new concert film, 
"Eurythmics Live," is no dif-
ferent. 

After their first two albums, 
"Sweet Dreams" and 
"Touch," Annie Lennox, the 
lead vocalist for the Euryth-
mics, had the image of being a 
sultry temptress, a Garbo to 
Madonna's Monroe. I had 
visions of her silkily gliding 
across the stage, teasing the 
audience. My dream turned to 
nightmare as she pranced 
across the stage clad in nothing 
more than leather pants and a 
red brassiere. She had sunk 
down to the depths of early 
Madonna. 

One of the few good things 
about his movie were the 
colors. There were three main 
colors used throughout the 
concert. All the band members 
were wearing black and white 
outfits, with blood red wink-
ing in and out of the picture, 
on Lennox's lips and nails. 
This gave an image of surreal, 
ity that the directors (1 think 
that Dave Stewart, the gui tarist 
and main musical force behind 
the Eurythmics, played a large 
role in this direction) quickly 
killed with stupid extra-con-
cert "dream" scenes. Any 
other etherealness was also 
squandered by heavy-handed 
photography. 

A nnie Lenno~ of Eurythmics has a new look in her concert film" Eurythmics 
Lille," shown allhe Ken Cinema until March ,. 

Another of my main gripes 
was the quality of the sound. 
Granted, concerts never sound 
as good as studio perfor-
mances, but I expect a superior 
sound quality in a concert film 
or record. In "Eurythmics 
Live," the crowd might as well 
have stayed at home and 
phoned in their applause. They 
could not be heard at all, and 
when Lennox stopped singing 
and tried to get them to sing 
along, there were large gaps in 
the vocals. Part of the thrill of 
seeing a concert is witnessing 
the band-audience interaction, 
an element that we miss out 
on. 

Filmed at a concert just over 
a year ago, "Eurythmics Live" 
covers a lot of their material 
up to their most recent album 
"Savage." This is good, be-
cause "Savage" is their weak-
est effort to date. The album is 
overloaded with monotonous 
guitar and harmonica solos, a 
style that they must have 
started using for this concert. I 

Cdt that over half the concert 
was taken up by these horribly 
annoying interludes. 

The only strong part of the 
concert was an acoustic ver-
sion of "Who's that Girl?" 
from their "Touch" album. 
This is the way the Euryth-
mics started, just Lennox and 
Stewart, at theili best. The 
song lets Lennox lfse her amaz-
ing voice to the fullest. In the 
song we can hear her voice; 
there is no saxophone to 
drown her out. 

Just when every band is 
rushing to release their own 
concert film, "Eurythmics 
Live" shows an example of 
concert films at their worst. 
This is the day and age of 
MTV and video stores, so if 
you have to see a concert film, 
go to your local rental store 
and check out U2's "Live at 
Red Rocks ." If you must see 
the Eurythmics, I guarantee 
the best parts witt be shown as 
videos on MTV. 

Hairspray sticks 
by hilarie grey 

hiatu. intern 

In the age when high hair 
was high fashion, every teen's 
obsession was to master the 
new dances, from " The Mad-
ison" to "The Roach." This is 
the culture affectionately par-
odied by writer / director John 
Waters in "Hairspray," a 
broad ca ricature of "hairhop-
pers" in 1963 Baltimore. 

The story revolves around 
the heavy, but agile Tracy 
Turnblad (Ricki Lake), who 
lands a part as a regular dancer 
on Baltimore's equivalent of 
"American Bandstand," "The 
Corny Collins Show," and 
steals the spotlight from 
spoiled brat Amber Von 
Tussle (Colleen Fitzpatrick). 

Hefty female impersonator 
Divine and Jerry Stiller play 
Tracy's parents, who are over-
protective and cynical about 
rock n'r.oll ("t-hat jungle 
music"), until their daughter'S

Unbar ... LIg"""" of icing 

success proves lucrative. Tracy 
strikes an endorsement deal 
with the "Hefty Hideaway" 
large-sized clothing outlets. 

Singers Debbie Harry and 
Sonny Bono ooze appropriate 
slime as Amber's snobby, 
hopelessly unenlightened stage 
parents. Against the bubbly 
backdrop of original '60s 
music, from "Duke of Earl" 
to "Mashed Potato." "Hair, 
spray" plays like a cartoon, 
which leaves its heartfelt 
attempt at social statement 
hanging precariously out of 
place. 

The dance show is exclu-
sively white (excepting the one 
"Negro Day" per month), and 
Tracy, along with her awk-
wardly-charming best friend 
Penny (Leslie Ann Powers) 
become advocates of inte-
gration; their transition to 
social activism is shown when 
they rebelliously iron their 
hai r , in classic "Beatni k" 
style.

Hair

The seriou themes of 
racism and st:gregation never 
quite fit in with Waters' sweep-
ing parody of teenage style. 
The racist characters are 
shown to be outrageously so, 
as in a particularly embarras-
sing moment, when Pt:nny's 
mother, frightened to the core, 
runs crying and screaming 
through a black neighbor-
hood. 

When she discovers that 
Penny has a new black boy-
friend, she puts her daughter 
in a straitjacket, and leaves her 
to the electric shock therapy 
of a crazed psychiatrist. Al-
though this presentation suc-
ceeds in belittling and degra-
ding racists, it is often carried 
just past the boundaries of 
good taste.

the world. 

After seven yt:ars of t:du-
cating UCSD's students in 
music, Yuasa's music will be 
performed at UCSD's Man-
deville Auditorium by the La 
Jolla Civic/ University Sym-
phony Orchestra. His three-
movement musical work, 
"Scenes from Basho," was 
credited as one of the top 
musical works from modern 
Japan. It gives a musical affect 

However, the spirit ot fun 
at the center of "Hairspray" is 
kept alive by its endearlingly 
oddball cast. Lake and Powers 
are appealing as the idealistic 
teenagers, while Harry nearly 
steals the show as the sneering 
villain who packs a bomb in 
her bouffant hairdo. In a 
hilarious cameo appearance, 
Pia Zadora and The Cars' Ric 
Ocasek play a pair of black-
outfitted Beatniks, who philo-
sophize, quote Ginsburg'S 
"Howl," and excitedly pro-
pose that the teens "get naked 
and smoke some reefer." 

Although rendered uneven 
by the clash between its comic 
and serious levels, the light-
hearted spirit of "Hairspray," 
reflected in its bounc~, ' nos-
talgic soundtrack, holds it to-
gether as an entertaining, if 
somewhat disappointing film, 
which could en'up attracting 
a cult following, due to its 
outlandish sense of comedy. 

of three haikus written by 
Basho, the acknowledged crea-
tor of haikus. 

The LaJolla Symphony will 
perform music from other 
composers, as well as feature 
violin soloist, Frank Almond.

for Saturday and Sunday, 
March 5-6, at 8 pm and 5 pm, 
respectively. Tickets are $4 
for students and senior citi-
zens, $6 for general admission, 
and are available through the 
UCSD box office.
