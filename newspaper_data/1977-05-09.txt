North City .West is a proposed housing development located 
northeast of U~D, off Interstate 5. 

Accordmg to Dick Wilkens, a consultant (or the councll's Ulna use 
and transportation committee, council approval of the plan would 
"initiate a six~month study program in which proponents of the plan 
and City Manager Hugh McKinley will have to prove its feasibility." 

ASUCSD Vote Begins Wednesday 
To testify before the council, one should either register at the City 

Clerk's office, located direcUy across the hall from council chambers 
(on the twelfth floor of the City Administration Building downtown) or 
just stand up when testimony is requested during the hearing.

Pads and . City Enter Extra Innings Democracy springs into action once again this Wednesday and 
Thursday as the ASUCSD will hold 
its run~ff election along with the 
Revelle, Muir and Fourth College 
elections. 

San Diego City Councilman 
Floyd Morrow, an ardent o~ 
ponent of re-negotiation of the 
city's loan terms for the San 
Diego Padres, almost succeeded 
in blocking approval of the new 
terms last week when the council 
was scheduled to vote on the plan 
with only five members present. 

Morrow was ready to vote 
against the plan and cause it to 
lose without a five-member 
majority. But Deputy Mayor Lee 
Hubbard, author of the proposed 
new loan terms for the ball team, 
suggested delaying the vote for 
another week, when more council 
members presumably would be 
present. 

However, Morrow felt the 
council should not have delayed 
the matter another week just 
because other members were not

The ASUCSD run~ff will consist 
of: President : Steve Grady and

and Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs: Brad Drexler and Laura

Mayor Wilson was retrieved from other business in the city. It then 
voted to continue the item until Wednesday. 

On the individual college ballots, 
students will be choosing their 
college's three representatives to 
the ASUCSD Council. The four 
candidates from Revelle are: 

The council had been scheduled to review the new plan it approved 
two weeks ago (City Desk, April 25) which would give the Padres 10 
years to repay $2.14 million loaned them by the city for promotional 
purposes. Keith Carter, Steven V. Kozmary, 

Steve McGirr and Kathryn Wade. 
The seven Fourth College ca~ 
didates are: Reddy Biggs, Janet 
Bills, Steven Breckier, Brian M. 
Koperek, Robert S. McAdam, 
Kenzie S. Nicoll and Mark T. 
Wilson. Muir students will vote for 
two of the representatives and the 
third will be chosen by the Muir 
College Council. Muir's candidates 
are : Anita Vittor, Andy Schneider 
and Keven Eckery. 

Student Housing Bill Progresses 
SACRAMENTO-Legislation to include students under the protection 
of the Rumford Fair Housing Act successfully met its first challenge in 
the state Assembly last week. 

The bill, which would ouUaw housing discrimination against 
students, was approved by the Assembly Committee on Housing and 
Community Development by a four to one vote. The bill was in-
troduced by Howard Berman (D-Beverly Hills) at the request of the 
UC Student Lobby. 

"As long as students are able to meet the same obligations that are 
imposed on other tenants, then it is unfair to refuse them housing 
solely on the basis of their student status," Berman said when he in~ 
troduced the bill last month. 

All three individual college 
ballots also include a choice of how 
the college's ASUCSD reps will be 
chosen in the future . In addition, 
the Revelle ballot has candidates 
for its Revelle Committee of 
College Affairs and questions 
about college activities. 

Bennan introduced a similar bill in the last legislative session. The 
bill passed the Assembly and the Senate Committee on Local 
Government, but it died one vote short in the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. 

Part 2 of the Ynrk lnterview 

Special lnterests Prolonging Arms Race 
by Bert Lee 
Staff Writer 

Political and economical coercion for nuclear 
arms? Are the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks 
(SALT) effective? Is nuclear terrorism something we 
should fear in the near future? Do people frankly 
give a damn about current anns build up? Again we 
delve into the weapons issue with noted expert 
Herbert York. 

Herbert York 

TT: Are political leaders of both the US and USSR 
under political pressure by special interest groups 
who have a vested interest in the arms race? 

York: Yes. There is no solution that I know that 
effectively deals with this problem. What I try to do is 
keep the public sensitized, both through the media 
and my influence on top government officials. But 
clearly the level of sensitization on all fronts is in-
sufficient at this time. Perhaps this in part is due to 
the influence of vested interest groups to maintain the 
impetus of the anns race. 

TT: It appears then that public opinion and a~ 
prehension are crucial variables in halting the anns 
race. But is it not also clearly perceptible that the 
public is becoming desensitized to the arms race? 

York: That's true. CurrenUy there is no sign that 
the public is very broadly concerned. Only specialists 
such as myself are really applying any sort of 
political pressure on the public officials in both the 
Congress and the Executive Branch. But we must 
also keep in mind that the arms race is a two sided 
affair. Not only must the American public and 

.= govenunent be concerned with the gravity of the ~ nuclear arms build up, but other major natiOlMltates 
~ as well. The political leadership of all powers must 

~ remain sensitized to the issue. 
~ IT: Is reaching a consensus in the SALT talks 
a enough?

Bill Tying Reg Fee Hike to 
State Money Request Passed 

by Hugh McIntosh 
Staff Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO-Two measures 
which would prevent the 
registration fee increase scheduled 
for next fall were approved 
Tuesday evening by a legislative 
subcommittee. 

The Assembly Ways and Means 
Subcommittee on Education voted 
four to zero to require the 
University to rescind the reg fee 
increase if the university wants 3.3 
million dollars of State money it 
requested for laboratory costs. 

The subcommittee also approved 
a resolution by Assemblyman Tom 
Bates (D-Oakland) calling on the 
Regents to rescind the reg fee 
increase. The resolution, ACR 18, 
also requests that each campus' 
reg fee committee be allowed to 
raise the fee only when the com-
mittee thinks it is necessary . 

"According to our calculations, 
there is simply no need for a fee 
increase in 1977-78," said Jon 
Haber, co-director of the UC 
Student Lobby . . "Worse yet, the 
increase may keep many qualified 
students who lack money out of the 
University of california." 

Program Cut-backs 
UC Vice-president Chester 

McCorkle said a number of 
programs might have to be cut 
back if the reg fee increase is 
rescinded. Among these programs 
are : intercampus exchange 
program, eqmic studies, teaching 
assistant loans, student services 
and library support. 

The Student Afflnnative Action 
Program might also be hurt. The 
subcommittee approved more than 

two million dollars for the 
program, but made it contingent 
upon 1.5 million dollars of mat-
ching money from the University. 

McCorkle said the University 
might not be able to come up with 
the $1.5 million for Affirmative 
Action if the reg fee increase is 
rescinded. The University would 
then be in danger of losing some or 
all of the state support for the 
program. 

There is not enough money now 
available to cover the cost of 
programs funded by the reg fee 
next year. But University officials 
and the Student Lobby disagree 
over the size of the deficit. The 
University predicts that it will be 
$7.4 million, but the Lobby says it 
will be only $6.5 million. 

According to the University's 
figures, the reg fee increase would 
bring in $7.3 million. This would 
still leave a shortfall of $100,000 to 
be made up in program cuts. 

But according to the Student 
Lobby, the deficit can be made up 
from uncommitted reg fee 
reserves on each campus without 
the increa e. Eahc campus could 
pay f( r 3 percent of its programs 
costs .vith re erve fWlds and the 
deficit would be eliminated, Haber 
said. 

R,. f_ â¢ '''',,'.. . ""e ' 
Martha Cohen, chair of the reg 

fee committee at Berkeley said reg 
fee program costs clluld be 
reduced if everyone, especially Ule 
eneral public, were charged for 

using fee hmded programs such as

Center for Continuing Education of

COl vocation Revoked 
"Learning is very, very hard." "I can't understand any school that 

would teach that the atomic theory could be wrong." Those are just two 
examples of t.he pedagogical inertia that existed and had to be contended 
with at the Revelle Convocation. 

As one who participated in one of the panel discussions I was greaUy 
disappointed with the results (so far) ofthe Convocation. Believe it or not 
learning is not difficult. Performing the intellectual gymnastics 
necessary for a good grade is, however. And phenomenology firmly in 
hand, the atomic theory is just a mind-game whose rules will chaJ'lge 
eventually. 

As one who participated in the Convocation last Sunday, I attempted to 
offe r input of a more liberal sort. My contention was that it was not what 
we learned as much as it was how we learned it. Roger Revelle (who was 
scribbling equations at the time) stated that " learning how to learn" was 
the objective of Revelle College. But where is the " learning how to learn" 
when, from first grade to college graduation, we are " taught" from 
lectures (the force feeding of " facts")? 

As one who partIcipated I am not saying " tear down the schoo~ now 
and make things different" (although it couldn't hurt ). But where 15 the 
diversity of input when virtually all participants, from alumni to profs to 
students to visiting BÂ· IGoNÂ°AoMÂ·EÂ·S, were all so conservative? How 
does one re-evaluate something [rom the same point of view? 

As one who participated last Sunday aftt'fnoon may I give you the 
results and summary of all the speeches, hoopla, parent particlpauon 
and student input (where were you guys?)? Okay. "I have seve~l 
childrpn who go to school from UCLA to aiUN and my youngest, who IS 
about ready for college, will probably go to Revelle because I think the 
breadth of education is marvelous." Go toa library. You get the same for 
a lot less money and mental agony. With very few exceptions this is sad 
but true (excuse the cliche ). 

So, despite the Convocation and because of the low student professor 
input and because of the ultra conservativeness, "What we have here is a 
failure to communica te ."

Wilderness Course Brings 
New Dimension to Learning 

Contemporary Issues 20, which 
is perhaps better known as 
Wilderness and the Contemporary 
Man, is one of the most exceptional 
courses this university has to offer. 
The class focuses on a most crucial 
contemporary issue ; man's effect 

. on his environment. The lectures 
are presented by authorities from 
various backgrounds, allowing 
students to gain insight on a wide 
range of subjects all relating to the 
wilderness. 

Each section approaches the 
wilderness from a different per-
spective; for example, one section 
may rockclimb while another 
section sails, skies or photographs. 
Whatever the focus, all sections 
require some weekend outings 
allowing the students to interact 
with the wilderness in a variety of 

ways. Because of these activities 
some may feel academics are de-
emphaSized. In reality , however, 
the weekend trips give students the 
opportunity to actually exercise 
what they have been taught. 
Therefore, a cademics are 
enhanced through a new dimension 
only affordable by instruction not 
dependent on books alone. 

This course is not strictly geared 
to the " outdoors" type. Since all of 
us affect the environment in some 
way , it is necessary for each in-
dividual to explore his relationship 
between himself and his err 
vironment. The benefits resulting 
from this examination are well 
worth participation in Con-
temporary Issues 20.

Letters to the Editor 

n Jumps the Gun on Sports Issue 
It appears that the Triton Times 

has invented an issue. The out-
pouring of sympathy for an inter-
collegiate sports program at UCSD 
(Triton Times, 5/Sn7) is both 
thought-provoking and a welcome 
change from the apathy with which 
most students respond to issues of 
importance to them . Unfor-
tunately, it is misguided. 

The Advisory Committee for 
Student Fee Programs has at no 
time this year considered 
eliminating the intercollegiate 
sports program at UCSD. The 
Triton Times printed a story based 
on several persons' evaluation of 
what might occur three, five or ten 
years down the road, but made no 
mention of what was being done 
now. As it happens, the Advisory 
Committee has increased the funds 
for both intercollegiate and 
recreational athletics for 1977-78 in 
the budget it has submitted to the 
Vice-chancellor of student affairs. 

Much of this wasted energy 
would have been spared had the 
Triton Times bothered to establish 
just exactly what was being done in 
\.hose areas by asking a member of 
the committee (or two or three), 
rather than going off half-cocked. 
Of course, that would not have 

been necessary either if the Triton 
Times has sent a reporter to our 
meeting on a regular basis. 

Since the Advisory Committee 
recommends the allocation of 
almost four million dollars of 
student fee money, it would seem 
to me that the student newspaper 
would want to inform its reader-

ship about the committee 's 
deliberations accurately; or would 
that be expecting too much?

Archaeologist's Investigation Is 
, 

Amateurish "Pot hunting" 
The recent article in the Triton Times (April 22) about Dr. James 

Moriarty ill and his archaeological work in San Diego was an insult to the 
struggling new archaeology project at UCSD. It was incorrecUy stated 
that Brandes and Moriarty were affiliated with an archaeology field 
program at UCSD; they have no connection whatsoever with this campus 
but are, rather, associated with USD. _ 

When asked to comment on last summer's excavations at Chancellor 
McElroy's house, Moriarty "saw no reason for the re-digging," as he had 
excavated at the site in the 19508. Moriarty failed to mention that the site 
had been previously excavated in the fall of 1936, in 1948 and again in 1952. 
The problem with all of these excavations, including Moriarty's, is that 
no comprehensive report was ever pub~. 

What Moriarty fails to understand is that for every hour of excavating 
in the field at least six hours must be spent in highly specialized 
laboratory analyses. These analyses are conducted by specialists in a 
variety of fields, including paleontology, icthyology, mamma logy, soils, 
chronometrics, human osteology, climatology and lithics. 

The resulting specialized studies are then synthesized by a directing 
archaeologist and a comprehensive report is published. This report will 
describe the economic patterns of the ancient peoples and will recon-
'Itruct the climate and ecology of the area, Anythin~ other than this kind 
of comprehensive investigation is amateurish and just plain "pot-
hunting." 

If Moriarty had published a repOrt , it is possible that some of our 
present work would not have been necessary. It is exacUy approaches 
such as Moriarty's which have led to stagnation of ideas and perpetuated 
attitudes that sites such as the one in the Chancellor's backyard are just 
typical old Indian burial grounds. In our preliminary investigations of the 
University House archaeological site, we have already discovered that 
metates (seed and plant grinding tools ) were being used at least 8,300 
years ago in this area. This is one of the oldest examples of metate usage 
in the New World. 

Therefore, the early Indians who lived in the area around uam were 
apparently unique and little is known about their culture. The detailed 
analyses of the materials recovered during last swnmer's excavation are 
now in progress, and the results wiD provide further important 1& 
formation about the life-style of these early La Jolla residents.

YSA Uses Israel as "Scapegoat" 
Re: the Young Socialist Alliance 

article appearing in the April 3) 
issue of the Triton Times, .carr 
demning Israel. 

Nigeria, Sengeal, Swaziland, Zaire 
and Zambia. 

How can the YSA, or anyone for 
that matter, justify the double-
standards and hypocrisy leveled at 
Israel in terms of South Africa? 
The New York Times article also 
states that such Arab friends of 
African liberation as Saudi Arabia, 

cannot tolerate the blatant 
hypocrisy contained in the YSA 
article. Again, the Jews and Israel 
are being used as scapegoats, even 
when their involvement is small, 
relative to the other nations of the 
world. 

RALPH GRUNEWALD 

The YSA claims that " Israel is a 
staunch ally of South Africa," and Â· 
that Israel and the apartheid 
regime actively engage in trade 
and other exchanges. To be sure, it 
is morally intolerable to engage in 
arms traffic with South Africa. It is 
also deplorable to have com-
mercial dealings with the nation. 
But to single out Israel as the main 
culprit in such trade is hypocritical 
and anti-semitic. 

Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Dubai, and 
Abu Dhabi traffic with South II> 
Africa in oil, tourism, food and ~ 
arms. Also, an International '"

"Cinco de N1ayo" Festival Is 
Not the N\ajor Holiday 

Ever since I first came to UCSD I 
noticed the emphasis put on the 
celebration of the " Cinco de Mayo" 
Mexican holiday; 1 also noticed 
that not only at UCSD but in most 
of San Diego people believe that 
Cinco de Mayo is the most 
important national holiday in 
Mexico. My suspicion was corr 
firmed when the note appeared in 
the Triton Times issue of May 4th 
(Cinco de Mayo celebration 
scheduled) in which it was 
specifically stated that Cinco de 
Mayo is " The most important 
national holiday in Mexico." 

This letter is to point out that by 
far the most important national 
holiday in Mexico is on Sept. IS-IS 

which commemorates the 
beginning of the war of in-
dependence from Spain, back in 
1810. Probably the second most 
important national holiday in 
Mexico is on Nov. 20 which com-
memorates the beginning of the 
Mexican Revolution in 1910. This 
puts the Cinco de Mayo celebration 
in third place as far as importance 
goes. 

It is not my intention to cast a 
shadow on the Cinco de Mayo 
celebration on campus but, as a 
Mexican, I feel it necessary to 
clarify the issue, just for the sake 
of history.

energy, saying, "I have received 
no oil money currenUy or in the

SACRAMENTO-A legislative 
subcommittee agreed Tuesday 
with a charge by the University 
of california Student Lobby that 
the UC administration baa been 
shortchanging the Under-
graduate Teaching ExceUence 
Program over the last three 
years. 

The Assembly Ways and Means 
Subcommittee on Education 
found that the university has not 
paid the Excellence Program 
more than $400,000 of inflation-
compensation money supplied by 
the state for that program over 
the last three years. 

The subcommittee, which is 
considering the UC share of the 
state budget, voted to require 
that university to pay the 
program $290,000 next year to 
compensate for accrued inflation 
since 1973-74. It did not require 
the university to return the back 
inflation mooey. 

"The money is sorely needed 
for inflation," said Jon Haber, ~ 
director of the Student Lobby. 
" Without the $290,000 we simply 
could not do as much to improve 
undergraduate education ." 

Beginning in 1973-74, the state

baa allocated $1 million each year 
to the Undergraduate Teaching 
Excellence Program, also known 
as the $1 Million Fund. Each year 
since then the state has allocated 
additiooal money for the Fund to 
compensate for price and salary 
Increases. 

In testimony before the sub-
committee last month, Haber 
charged that' the university has 
used more than $900,000 ci Fund 
inflation money for other "high 
priority" purposes. Haber did not 
ask that this money be paid back. 

He did ask that the university 
be required to allocate . ,OOOilf 
state infiation-compensation 
money for the $1 Million Fund in 
1977-78. This is the amount the 
Fund has inflated since 1973-74, 
he said. 

Haber . said the Lobby 
presented its figures to the 
wiiversity to check on their ac-
cllracy. But he received no reply 
before the hearing In March when 
he made his charges, Haber said. 

UC Academic Vice-president 
Donald Swain said last month 
that the university has always 
considered the $1 Million Fund to 
be a program that requires no 
inflation compensation. 

At the hearing on Tuesday, 
Swain said the university has 
been unaware of the legislature's 
intent that the Fund should 
receive inflation money. The 
university should therefore only 
have to pay compensation money 
for the inflation from this year to 
next, he said. That amount would 
be $74,000. 

The subcommittee rejected 
. Swain's proposal in favor of the 

$290,000 figure.

Kraftwerk Overcomes Sterility 
Without Losing Alienation 

by Paul Watry 
staff Writer 
Loo~g at the folll' members of Kraftwerk 00 the cover ci their new 
album~ It is easy to. fonnulate the idea that the people in the band look 
m?re ~e mB:nneq~ than anything else. Decked out in checkered grey 
SUits, pm-strlped ties and waxy grins, they look entirely devoid of all 

huma.M~ . . Perha~s this is the best Indication of their own work because, 
certainly, It IS of an inhuman quality . 

Kraft,:,erk ~ the product of slick production techniques which de-
~mphaslZe theU'own musical qualities. The result is often interesting, but 
I~ caM~t be ca~ed good music. The album RadJoactlvtty, for example, is 
f~ed w~ special effects that sound both bizarre and spectacular on the 
first heanng. But these same effects on subsequent lIatenings detract 
and hold the album back from its musical potential. ' 

:rralll-Earope ~prell, their lB:test album, does not repeat this 
~1:aI'.e . The mUSlcal quality on this record is not sacrifi.ced for the ar-
tificiality of spacy effects which appeared on other records. Trau-
Europe Express is, instead, an astonishing musical document; one which 
combines elegance and decadence into an electronic fugue- which 
somehow also manages to retain both its spacy effects and musical 
quality at the same time. 

triton times 

Supertramp The. secret to Trau-Europe Express is the success of Kraftwerk in carry~g out the t,heme of alienation in an industrialized society. Kraft. 
werk IS perfect m expressing the mechanized inhumaMess of con-
temporary auto~tion. They are equally adept at expressing horror at 
the loss of . the~ own personal Identity because of this automatioo. 
Kraftwen, m this album, relies successfully on the haunting sound of 
echoing synthesizers and special effects blended Into a fugue to convey 
this meaning. 

Tramping Up To Superstardom 
~ like " Hall of Mirrors" and " Show-Room Dummies" exemplify 

this aWtude exacUy. When Kraftwerk sings about "We start to move we 
break the glasslWe step out and take a walk through the citylWe 'are 
show-room dummies," it is absolutely certain that they are talking about 
escaping the reach of an industrialized Europe in 1977. 

This electrifying effect of alienation is augmented by the voices of Ralf 
H~ter a.nd Florian ~ider, two members of the band. When they sing, 
their VOICes sound chilling: an effect which is reinforced by the harsh 
German accents of. the ~inger:s echoing back and forth on both speakers. 
The texture of thell' VOices, Juxtaposed against ultra~lectronic music 
sounds horrifying. ' 

The effect is magnetic.

Find Out From Hands & Feet 

The masked man looks on as sirife continues in the midst of the big city. I 
Hands" Feet, Lamb's Players' 

pantomime troup, will be 
presenting their full-length mime 
show, " Who Was That Masked 
Man? " on June 1st Wednesday at 
Revelle Plaza. Performance time 
is 12:00. 

Prior to the show, the troupe 
entertains their audiences with on-
the-spot improvisations. After 
setting the mood, the actual play 
begins with scenes of creation. 
From there we are moved silently 
through time and history to the 
brink of the future . On the brink. 

the scene switches to a crowded i 
city ; into the midst of activity and 
coofusion comes " the masked 
man." Encountered by one so 
unique, the mimes portray dif-
ferent people wondering, "Who 
was the masked man? " 

Lamb's Players-a dramatic arts 
company based in San Diego, 
califomia-present their shows 
free of charge to the public. Last 
year they perfonned for more than 
140,000 people throughout the West 
and Midwest.

Arts Editor 

Supertramp is a progressive 
English band that has finally 
come of age . After shows in lAlS 
Angeles and San Diego, In-
cluding a Forum crowd of 
15,000 , Supertramp has 
demonstrated that their 
following is not as small and 
cultish as one might believe. 

However, numbers do not 
belie the fact that Super-
tramp is a fine touring band, 
playing with deftness and 
precision not too often seen by 
concert goers. Featuring 
material from the LP's Crime 

Students' Plays 
Presented 

Graduate Studio P roductions 
will present two shows this week in 
the Studio Theat re (409 Me) . 

Mark Medoff's The Wager, 
directed by Peter Hackett, is billed 
as a fast-paced comedy in which 
humor is discovered within 
situations which are not con-
spicuously amusing. The play 
starts tonight and will be presented 
again on Wednesday and Friday. 
Showtime is 8. 

1be Empire Builders by Boris 
Vian, directed by Jennifer Parent, 
is about death, violeJice and a 
failure to communicate . The Â· 
characters - a nice American 
family - attempts to maintain a 
gracious life style amid the 
disintegration of a society whose 
ideals have outlived their 
usefulness. 

The play begins its run 
tomorrow , with presentations 
again on Thursday and Saturday. 
Showtime is 8.

of the Century and CrIses? What 
Crisis?, the band also In-
troduced some exemplary 
music fr om the recently 
released Even In The Quilest 
Moments. "Give A tittle Bit" is 
simple acoustic number that 
builds in intensity and should be 
a natural selection for a single 
while the tour de force "Foo~ 
Overture" provided an ex-
cellent finale to the show, 
replete with slide show and 
taped effects. 

The band centers its spotlight 
on the abilities of key boardist 
Rick Davies and guitarist 
Roger Hodgson, both delivering 

sterling performances . 
Supertramp should find 
someone besides John Heillwell 
to rap with the audience, 
though, as his sense of humor 
and approach are on the stiff 
side. 

It nice, even refreshing for a 
change to see a band whose 
material is not consistenUy on 
the Top 40 playlist. And while 
Supertramp fares much better 
in person than on disc, it still 
appears that the band will 
break really big in the near 
future . You can't keep a good 
man (band ) down.

What's 
Up? Dear Doc: And on the rare days when you are funny, Oh, we think that there shall never 

be, 
A weekly column as disreputable 
as the one we see. 

Your answers are trite, 
Your wit has no bite, 
But our question, Doc, is, are you 

ever right? 

Besides having answers that are 
generally poor, 
They indicate in addition that you 
area bore. 

And, Doc, when you're not 
crumby, 

You've plagiarized, you dummy. 
UCSD Students 

Sniff ... Sniff... 
Well, if THAT'S the way you feel... 

Pleethe Mitbter Bunny Rabbit. 
Don' t feel tbo bad. I wuv you. 
You're rigbt, Tweety. It 's time to 
figbt back. 

I tbink that shall never see, 
A critic get the best of me. 
And since their poetry has no 
merit, 
I' ll go back and eat my carrot.

his coaching career at La Mirada 
and came back to UC San Diego in 
1971. Even though he's resigned at 
this campus, Becker will still 
coach age group teams at the 
YMCA while Â· continuing his 

education. 
As far as a replacement ia 

concerned, the ex-Triton coach 
says "they'll bring in somebody 
who's not willing to work at it. The 
various problems in the PE 
Department (lack of manpower, 
facilltes and above all~uality 
athletes) will deteriorate the 
program unless the time is put in. " During his sis years at UC San Diego (four as head coach, two as 

an asaistant), Becker compiled an 
overall winning percentage rl .426 
in water polo, including an 11-12 
mark this season. According to 
officials in the pbysical educatiOn 
department, no successor has been 
named.

The resignatioo, Becker states, 
is largely due to his desire to 
pursue a master's degree in PE at 
San Diego State University and, 
"hopefully afterwards, I'll go back 
to coaching." In addition to going 
back to school, Becker, at 28 years 
old, pointed out "there was no 
inducement to stay. I had 
developed the . program and 
progressed as a coach as far as 
possible. "

The UQ;D rowing team ended 
their regular season with their 
most impressive showing to date. 
Racing against USC and UC Santa 
Barbara at San Pedro Harbor, the 
Tritons came away with three 
firsts, two seconds and one third. 

In the first event, the UCSD frosh 
eight extended theii string of 
victories to two in a row with a 
nine-tenths second win over UCSB. 
USC was a distant third. Not to be 
outdone the Triton lightweight 
eight also chalked up their second 
win in as many reaces. 

It had been said that the 
resignation was submitted because 
the water polo team had attained 
the program's ultimate goal-to 
beat SDSU, which they did last 
November li, 14-10. But, in a 
telephone interview, he denied the 
rumor. Waferpolo! swlmming coach Gary Becker resigns after six years 01 UCSD. \

distance. The lead in the light-

IFYOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE 
NUCLEAR NAVY, 

THE SHIP SAILS ON MAYIS. 

One of the best ways to get 
into engineering is to get into 
~he nuclear Navy. But you'd 
better get moving fast. May 
15th is the deadline for this 
year's Navy Nuclear Propul-
sion Candidate Program. 

The Navy can give you 
the most comprehensive 
nuclear training possible. 
Because we operate over half 
the nuclear reactors in 
America. We start by giving 
you a year of advanced engi-
neering technology. This 
would cost you thousands in 

graduate school, but in the 
Navy, we pay you. 

Once you're commissioned 
as a Navy Nuclear Officer, 
you'll earn a top salary. Over 
$24,000 a year after four 
years. And you'll get practical 
experience on the most 
advanced nuclear equipment 
devised by man. All the Navy 
asks in return is that you 
serve for 3 years on active 
duty upon completion of your 
training. 

But rememb r May 15th 
is the deadlin for thi ear' 
class. If you are majoring in 

NAVY OFFICER. 

engineering, math or physi-
cal sciences, find out from 
your local placement office 
when a Navy recruiter will 
be on campus. Or call toll free, 
800-841Â·8000 (in Georgia, 
800-342-5855) for more 
information. If you're still a 
junior, ask about the 
Navy's NUPOC Collegiate 
Program, which pays you up 
to $6,000 during your enior 
year. And hurry. Time and 
tide wait fi r no man.

York: No. Although the total 
number of weapons will be 
stabilized, modernization will 
continue. The SALT talks are 
simply not sufficient in and of 
themselves. Hopefully, though, 
they represent the first step in 
eventual bilateral reductions. This 
will continue to prove difficult, 
however, simply because the 
complexities of the technological 
impetus on both sides will continue 
on divergent paths. 

IT: Should the Russians be 
allowed to maintain more delivery 
weapons due to their geopolitical 
'constraints? 

York: Let me put it this way, the 
Russians have a great deal to be 
paranoid about, perhaps more than 
we do. For instance, the Russians 
have to be wary of even their allies. 
In addition, the emergence of 
China as a viable superpower is

nuclear arsenal of some magnitude 
and these countries remain outside 
the context of sufficient US or 
USSR political control. The current 
coupling between the SALT talks 
and control of nuclear proliferation 
is weak. If they succeed, it will be 
easier to put a cap on nuclear 
proliferation, but there is no 
guarantee. It's not a very 
promising proposition. 

IT: can we control this process 
by controlling and capping the 
growth of the production of 
fissionable materials, such as 
President Carter recently 
suggested? 

York: Yes, there are a nwnber of 
forums such as agencies 
established through the UN and 
treaties and agreements such as 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 
1968, that deal with this problem. 
But these efforts are riot well 
organized. The swn of these efforts 
have slowed down the proliferation 
of fissionable material production, 
but even so, we are losing ground.

political constraints within the US 
will mitigate against too much of a 
concession on our part in this 
matter. 

To celebrate its tenth birthday, 
Muir College has scheduled this 
week as John Muir College Week, 
which began with Saturday's Trike 
Race and will conclude this 
Saturday with a party on lower 
Muir Quad. 

Also scheduled for the week-long 
festivities are hypnotist Michael 
Dean, a Hootenanny Night and a 
workshop on science fiction. 

Dean, who bills himself as the 
" world's foremost hypnotist," will 
perform Monday night at 9 in the 
Muir cafeteria. Only Muir students 
will be allowed at the performance. 

Tuesday will be highlighted by 
the science fiction workshop. Led 
by Muir Resident Counselor Don 
Raub, the workshop is titled "The 
Martian Perspective: I.ooking at 
Society through Science Fiction," 
and is set for Tuesday afternoon at 
4 in the Muir apartment lounge. 

Hootenanny Night is scheduled 
for Wednesday night at 9:15 in the 
Muir Five and Dime Coffeehouse. 

A Pathways workshop on _ 
"Alternatives to Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse" is one of two events set for 
Thursday. The :workshop will take-

York: I think there is much less a 
chance of this occurring than 
current discussions would lead one 
to believe. Security of nuclear 
power plants within the nuclear 
club appears to be sufficient at this 
time But, nevertheless , the 
potentiality does exist, and as the 
nuclear industry becomes more 
and more integrated into the 
national life everywhere, the 
possibilities of terrorism will in-
crease as we go down the road. 

'17: Will it take a nuclear ac-
cident of holocaust proportions 
before the public and its leaders 
recognize the absurdity of the 
current situation? 

York: You see, it is not enough to 
recognize the absurdity of the 
situation. We have to find a 
political solution through the maze, 
and it is this solution that is 
proving to be so elusive. The 
problems of international 
relations, of domestic constraints; 
of the technological impetus and a 
lack of public awareness, are all 
contributing factors to the losing 
battle. The public and its leaders 
must take political action to slow 
this process down. Hopefully, we 
can eventually initiate muta! 
reductions on all fronts. But 
currently, I can perceive no signs 
that we are dealing with this 
problem effectively.
