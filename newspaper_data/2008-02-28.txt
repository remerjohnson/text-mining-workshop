often related programs that do not require stu-
dents who want to study Israel to live there, and 
selecting one of these options enables students 
to avoid the extra paperwork and financial chal-
lenges of going through OAP.

“One of the things that we try to do is we try 
to make sure that they’ve thought about other 
places they could go to study Israel from afar as 
opposed to going there,” Burton said. “We want 
to make sure they’ve explored all of the options,

Responding to a policy restricting students 
from studying abroad in Israel, state Sen. Carole 
Migden (D-San Francisco) introduced legisla-
tion last month designed to overturn the limita-
tions, citing the relatively low level of concern 
expressed by the State Department. 

The university first employed the limitations 
in February 2002 after the State Department 
issued a travel advisory warning regarding threats 
of terrorism in Israel. Since then, the restrictions 
have prohibited UC students from studying in 
Israel under the systemwide Education Abroad 
Program. Students interested in traveling to 
Israel must pursue their studies through the 
Opportunities Abroad Program instead. 

Under the restrictions, if students are in Israel 
for more than one quarter, they must withdraw 
from the university and apply for readmission,  
a standard practice for any student studying 
abroad. The $65 fee reapplication is normally 
waived for study-abroad students, but students 
studying in a country with a travel advisory 
warning must pay the fee. They must also sign 
a more extensive waiver releasing the univer-
sity from any liability if they are harmed while 
abroad.

In light of a controversial debate 
regarding the erection of a parking 
structure on the northeast corner 
of Gilman Drive and Myers Lane 
to accommodate the ongoing Price 
Center expansion project, T&PS has 
decided to encourage alternative 
modes of transportation, such as 
nonmotorized and public transpor-
tation. 

However, if 5 percent of single-
car users are unable to locate park-
ing on campus, T&PS will restrict 
resident freshmen’s parking ability.

the construction of a new building

Though protests from students 
compelled the Transportation 
Policy Committee to vote against 
the construction of any new park-
ing structures on the main campus 
in the near future, the committee 
approved a structure near Thornton 
Hospital at its meeting earlier this 
month.

Prompted by the addition of a 
new bed tower and cardiovascular 
center at the hospital, the recom-
mendation of a Thornton parking 
structure reflects an effort to ensure 
that the campus stay in compliance 
with the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, since the recent developments 
will generate an increase in hospital 
visitors.

“The decision made was out of 
necessity more than anything else,” 
TPC’s A.S. Council Representative 
Peter Benesch said. “Allowing for 
disabled persons to park close to 
their treatment facility is definitely 
a need as opposed to the desire for 
students to park near the center of 
campus.”

Although the construction of the 
structure will cost approximately

Campus programmers are engi-
neering new ways to market, advertise 
and publicize their flagship Sun God 
Festival to emphasize campus commu-
nity and togetherness.

The new direction will steer the 
annual daylong event away from tradi-
tional student-popular leanings of alco-
hol consumption and center on com-
munity-building themes. Last year’s 
festival marked a spike in instances of 
unsafe activity; the police department 
registered higher levels of arrests and 
citations, with over half of those relat-
ing to nonaffiliates.

Brian Ross, director of campus 
events for the University Events Office, 
said that the size and popularity of 
Sun God has attracted attention that, 
though lively, has at times turned haz-
ardous.

“Student safety is the prime con-
cern,” Ross said last month. “The 
direction toward a campus commu-
nity-building Sun God naturally leads 
to a focus on the UCSD student.”

Administrators would also like to 
hone in on the campus community, 
said university spokeswoman Dolores 
Davies.

“This is an important event that has 
the potential to help build community 
and enhance our students’ affiliation 
to their colleges and the university,” 
she said.  

She added that the university would 
want to see “an event that protects the 
health, safety and security of event 
participants and staff.”

Security is handled through A.S. 
Programming, which utilizes a plan 
that integrates student volunteers, staff, 
the UCSD Police Department, private 
security and facility personnel. In addi-
tion, the campus police department 
recruits law enforcement professionals 
from other UC campuses, San Diego 
State University and local law enforce-
ment, Davies said. 

After the festival’s 25th anniver-
sary last year, Associate Vice President 
of Programming Kevin Highland and 
administrators initiated a university-
wide dialogue on the event’s countless 
operations. The findings were com-
piled into a “planning report” that con-
tained input the group gathered from 
several campus departments. Many 
departments voiced alarm over how

New Vice 
Chancellor to 
‘Wage War’ on 

Diversity Issues
By Christina Homer
Senior Staff Writer

Frequenters of the Chancellor’s 
Complex may have noticed the arrival 
of a new neighbor last month — a 
fresh-faced woman sporting Sun Tzu’s 
The Art of War as a metaphor for 
the task she was hired to complete. 
According to the campus’ newest asso-
ciate vice chancel-
lor, Sandra Daley, 
her office is gear-
ing up for a long-
awaited war: one 
to change the 
imp over ished 
state of diversity 
at UCSD.

Daley recent-
ly succeeded 
theater pro-
fessor Jorge Huerta as associate vice 
chancellor and chief diversity officer 
at UCSD, a dual position created by 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox accord-
ing to the recommendations of the 
Chancellor’s Diversity Council and the 
Senate-Administration Task Force on 
Underrepresented Faculty.

See DIVERSITY, page 3

$29.1 million, UCSD Transportation 
and Parking Services will only foot 
about $5.8 million. 

The remaining expenses will be 
covered by hospital administrators, 
according to Benesch.

“[They] have put money aside 
to pay for part of this structure 
as an act of good faith,” Benesch 
said. “This partial payment by an 
interested party has never happened 
before.”

The new structure would 
increase monthly parking permit 
fees by less than $0.60 per year. 
The facility will have a parking 
breakdown of roughly 80 percent 
visitor parking and 20 percent staff 
parking.

Following student petititon, 
campus officials reject  
unpopular main-campus 
structure, propose Thornton 
Hospital alternative.

Committee, programming 
discuss new marketing 
approach to festival, which 
has garnered concerns 
over safety and alcohol.

Sandra Daley
Chief Diversity Officer

While the program does not actually prevent 
students from going to Israel, there are financial 
aid restrictions on students who study in coun-
tries with a travel advisory warning, Programs 
Abroad Office representative Jim Galvin said.

Migden proposed Resolution 18 last month 
in an effort to reverse study-abroad restrictions. 
The bill is currently in the Senate education 
committee and will likely receive a hearing in 
the next few months. If approved, the resolution 
will could affect UC students as early as this 
summer.

Moores Cancer Center 
Offers Awareness Seminar

UCSD’s Rebecca and John 
Moores Cancer Center will offer 
a free public seminar on March 
15 to discuss the prevention and 
screening of colorectal cancer.  

The event, which will be held 
at the  center from 10 a.m. to 1 
p.m., coincides with Colon Cancer 
Awareness Month and will include 
topics such as “Importance of 
Colorectal Cancer Screening and 
Screening Strategies” and “Family 
History and Genetic Testing.”  

Colorectal cancer, which 
occurs in the colon or rectum, 
is the second leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths in the U.S.  
According to the American Cancer 
Society, the five-year survival rate 
for those treated in the early stag-
es of colorectal cancer before it 
has spread is greater than 90 per-
cent.  However, only 39 percent of 
colorectal cancer cases are diag-
nosed at an early stage.

Scripps Excursion Finds 
New Threats to Coral Reefs

Scientists at UCSD’s Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography pub-
lished information this week related 
to coral reefs and the threat of 
human activities such as pollution, 
global warming and overfishing –
results from an expedition they led 
to a chain of remote islands in the 
central Pacific Ocean.

The exploration of four atolls 
in the Line Islands, which are situ-
ated approximately 1,000 miles 
south of Hawaii, is the first study 

of coral reefs that comprehensibly 
covers organisms from microbes 
to sharks.  

“One of the major surprising 
findings from this study, with direct 
conservation relevance, is that the 
healthier reefs showed the capac-
ity to recover from climate change 
events,” SIO scientist Stuart Sandin 
said in a press release. “When 
the ecosystem structure is intact, 
the corals appear to bounce back 
better from previous warm water 
events that have killed coral.”

UCSD Libraries Plan Party 
for Dr. Seuss’ Birthday
Campus community members 

and Dr. Seuss fans have been 
invited to the celebration of the 
late Theodor Seuss Geisel’s 104th 
birthday.  The event will be held on 
March 3 at 11:50 a.m. on Library 
Walk, where a giant inflatable “Cat 
in the Hat” will mark the site.  

Audrey Geisel, the beloved 
author’s widow, will be present to 
cut the first pieces of cake.  She will 
be joined by Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox and Audrey Geisel University 
Librarian Brian E.C. Schottlaender 
in greeting attendees.  Free punch 
and about 2,000 slices of cake will 
be served to honor Dr. Seuss.  

Matthew Swagler, an under-
graduate from Sixth College, has 
composed a musical piece com-
missioned by the UCSD Arts Library 
and University Carillonneur Scott 
Paulson to be played on the Geisel 
Library chimes. 

The Teeny Tiny Pit Orchestra led 
by Paulson will also be performing 
songs from “The Cat in the Hat 
Songbook.”

As chief diversity officer, a position 
first held by UC President Robert C. 
Dynes while he was UCSD’s chancel-
lor, Daley will act as the primary link 
between the campus community and 
its administration by gathering infor-
mation for Fox regarding the state of 
campus diversity.

To illustrate the goals of her new 
position, Daley carries around The Art 
of War, which she received in graduate 
school. She said she finds it a fitting 
itinerary for her position because she 
sees any change to the status quo as an 
act of war.

“When we talk about equity, we are 
at war,” Daley said. “Society is a system 
and all systems seek to be at rest ... So it 
resists change because that is not a state 
of rest. So if you want change, you have 
to go to war.”

Daley relocated to her new post 
from UCSD’s School of Medicine, 
where she served as assistant dean of 
diversity and community partnerships, 
as well as a professor of pediatrics. 

“I stopped seeing patients and 
transferred that excitement and com-
mitment to students,” she said.

After only one month in office, 
Daley said she is just beginning to 
explore diversity as it stands at UCSD. 
Although she does not yet have any 
concrete goals, Daley plans to take a 
community-based approach to diver-
sity issues, which she calls her trade-
mark strategy.  

“We need diversity of thought,” 
Daley said. “We need diversity of action. 
We need diversity of experiences. And I 
think UCSD as a place is paying atten-
tion to it. We’re speaking; the students 
are speaking.”

Daley highlighted UCSD’s progress 
in this field, offering student-support-
ed scholarships aimed at promoting 
diversity such as the I Pledge Student 
Scholarship. In addition, the campus 

has many organizations and commit-
tees designed to promote tolerance, 
she said.

Daley said her overarching goal is 
to create an inclusive atmosphere for all 
potential members of the UCSD com-
munity. She believes that the power to 
attract people comes from welcoming 
them into their new positions as stu-
dents, faculty and staff members.

A report recently released by the Ralph 
J. Bunch Center for African American 
Studies at UCLA criticized UCSD for its 
low enrollment of black students due to 
admissions policies that exclude students’ 
educational backgrounds.  

However, the number of black stu-
dents admitted to the campus has been 
rising over the past nine years. For the 
entering class of 2011, 350 black students 
were admitted. In addition, the percent-
age of underrepresented ethnic minori-
ties was at its highest in 10 years, compris-
ing 16.1 percent of admitted students.

Daley said percentages of one eth-
nicity or another on campus are not her 
primary concern.

“To create a diverse group of people 
... you don’t need a bunch of people who 
look like me or think like me,” Daley 
said. “All you need is enough diversity to 
feel like there is room for me.”

Her next step is to engage UCSD 
community members to find out what 
students feel they need for their educa-
tion and how to best facilitate the work 
of the staff and faculty. Daley said she 
believes community members already 
know the problems and the best way to 
approach them.

“When you enter a community, just 
be quiet and listen,” Daley said. “You 
shut up and listen to the problems. 
You shut up and listen to the solutions. 
Then you ask, ‘What resources do I 
have to help?’”

the event clashed with the university’s 
safety and academic missions.

“It is clear … that a thorough 
evaluation of the festival was needed,” 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary R. Ratcliff said. “The statis-
tics from last year’s festival certainly 
give pause for concern.”

Ratcliff noted that paramedics 
responded to 35 medical aid calls and 
at least nine people were transported 
to the hospital. In addition, he said 
50 people were sent to the San Diego 
Alcohol Detox Center.

Over the past month, the Sun 
God Planning Committee has dis-
cussed and debated departmental 
input; the committee’s membership is 
a collection of top-level administra-
tors and student politicians, ranging 
from Police Chief Orville King to 
UEO Director Martin Wollesen to 
Highland himself.  

The members have touched on 
nearly every facet of the festival, which 
included the evening concert’s increas-
ingly unmanageable and alarming 
safety concerns, student perception of 
Sun God and impacts of the strong 
non-UCSD presence. The committee 
wants to take a “line-by-line” approach 
to the report, Wollesen said when the 
committee began its discussions, pick-
ing apart each of the document’s sug-
gestions to evaluate their respective 
plausibility.

At last week’s A.S. Council meeting, 
Vice President of Student Life Donna 
Bean said that the committee’s stu-
dents and administrators had reached 
a general agreement on how the festival 
should be hosted. Highland could not 
be reached for comment.

Council Will Not Eat Green Eggs 
and Ham (In a Parking Structure)

A multiweek debate drought has left the A.S. Council with-out any substantive disputes 
among its members lately, and that 
trend continued last night. Parking was 
the primary item of discussion, along 
with some chatter about the best way 
to make colored eggs.

The prospect of a new parking struc-
ture at UCSD has been a recurring issue 
at council meetings this year because 
of concerns about sustainability and 
rising permit costs. Councilmembers 
have repeatedly voiced opposition to 
the proposal, but Earl Warren College 
Senator Peter 
Benesch reported 
that at least one 
administrator is 
trying to keep hope 
alive for a new 
heap of concrete 
and rebar.

According to 
Benesch, Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Edward Spriggs was 
“disappointed” with the council’s deci-
sion to favor the expansion of alterna-
tive and public forms of transporta-
tion in lieu of a new parking struc-
ture. Councilmembers revisited the 
debate about the $30-million structure, 
although the discussion was under-
standably one-sided.

The consensus was a standard-
issue complaint that administrators 
weren’t putting students’ interests first. 
Councilmembers also feared that the 
multiple $30 fee hikes that would be 
necessary over the next few years would 
price students out of parking permits.

To some extent, administrators have 
framed the proposed parking struc-
ture as essential to realizing their wet 
dream of a new bustling downtown dis-
trict in the soon-to-be-finished Price 
Center expansion. To that, All-Campus 
Senator Meghan Clair pointed out that 
the Gilman Parking Structure usually 

has hundreds of free spots after 4 p.m.
An emerging administrative move-

ment in favor of a parking structure 
could be particularly troublesome for 
councilmembers because faculty mem-
bers outweigh undergraduate students 
in the world of Transportation and 
Parking Services decision-making.

To that end, Thurgood Marshall 
College Senator Kyle Samia implored 
the council to raise student awareness 
about the issue to discourage admin-
istrators from going forward with the 
project.

Parking wasn’t the only important 
issue that the council 
addressed, however. 
Councilmembers 
also opened a dia-
logue about scram-
bling together a 
celebration of Dr. 
Seuss’ birthday with 
the august history 

of St. Patrick’s Day by serving green eggs 
at the A.S. Pancake Breakfast on March 
17.

The council has not yet decided if 
the eggs should be colored by the use 
of food coloring or basil and cilantro. 
Perhaps a new committee is in order.

In addition to a deep respect for 
childhood foodstuffs, the council’s lim-
ited days left in office also became 
apparent. Vice President of Student 
Life Donna Bean censured certain 
unnamed councilmembers for failing 
to show up at a recent retreat that 
covered the specifics of the transition 
process that the council will undergo 
next quarter.

Associate Vice President of College 
Affairs Tanya Piyaratanaphipat lever-
aged her dessert-making prowess to 
encourage students to participate in a 
flyering offensive in Price Center to get 
the word out about elections. Expect to 
find any councilmember with a sweet 
tooth taping up handouts next week.

ply no longer a secure method of 
increasing revenue to pay for such 
things as a new parking structure.”

While annual parking per-
mit sales will produce a $643,257 
increase in revenue this year, the 
number of permits sold will decrease 
by 142 purchases, according to the 
T&PS budget. 

Additionally, citations will bring 
in a surplus of approximately $1.8 
million, with estimated increments 
of $50,000 in funds for the next six 
years.

“Citation revenue is used to par-
tially fund the university’s shuttle 
program,” T&PS Assistant Director 

Charles Kindred 
said. “We issue 
approximately 
14,000 citations 
per quarter.”

S e v e r a l 
T&PS adminis-
trators and A.S. 
cabinet mem-
bers discussed 
the possibil-
ity of a parking-
related referen-
dum last sum-
mer, but they 

dropped the idea at the beginning 
of the school year.

“There is no parking referen-
dum under consideration,” T&PS 
Director Brian d’Autremont said.

TPC is an advisory committee to 
Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven W. Relyea. 

The committee presents its rec-
ommendations to Relyea, who will 
finalize the decision by either reject-
ing or concurring with the vote.  

Relyea could not be reached for

maybe going somewhere in Europe 
where they focus on study of that 
region. But for students who have 
made a well-informed decision that 
they do want to go to Israel, then we 
do have this procedure in place.”

According to Burton, typical stu-
dents who want to study abroad in 
Israel have some familiarity with the 
country, such as being in contact with 
relatives who have visited or currently 
reside there. 

Some Jewish 
advocacy groups 
have disputed the 
restriction and 
expressed support 
for Migden’s reso-
lution.

Lisa Goldstein, 
a rabbi at UCSD 
Hillel, said there 
are specific parts of 
Israel that are more 
dangerous than 
others, but the locations of study-
abroad universities are relatively safe. 

“It’s like saying that because 
South Central L.A. is danger-
ous, you can’t go to California,” 
Goldstein said.   

However, Burton said that as 
long as EAP remains a UC-oper-
ated entity,  the university does not 
have the authority to implement 
changes. 

“Unfortunately we’re not involved 
in any of that decision making, but 
we’re really glad that we’re able to 
provide students with a process in 
the meantime to be able to go,” she 
said.

Revelle College senior Michael 
Friedman, who studied in Jerusalem 
for a year, works with MASA Israel 
Journey, an organization that helps 
people ages 18 through 30 visit 
Israel. Although Friedman was able 
to receive credit for the courses he 

completed while abroad, he said the 
overall process entailed unnecessary 
bureaucratic hassles. 

Friedman added that the 
University of California used to have 
three offices in Jerusalem, all of which 
are now closed.

When Friedman failed to find 
a campus administrator to sign a 
form that would enable him to 
study abroad, he discovered that 
the university in Jerusalem had a 

policy of waiv-
ing the require-
ment for UC 
students because 
they found UC 
officials to be 
uncooperative. 

As  an 
orthodox Jew, 
Friedman said it 
was ridiculous 
that he could 
study abroad in 
a country such 

as Egypt, which does not have a 
travel advisory warning, where his 
safety would be much more at risk 
than in Israel.

Friedman said that even though 
Israel was at war with Lebanon at 
the time, everything at the university 
was normal and daily life continued 
as usual.

“Not once did I feel that I was in 
mortal danger,” he said. 

Friedman recently met with 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to 
discuss the difficulties of study-
ing abroad in Israel. According to 
Friedman, Fox said it is important 
that the university be known as a 
friendly institution for study-abroad 
opportunities, and she expressed 
plans to facilitate the process for 
future EAP students.

because every member of the com-
mittee felt that the campus commu-
nity had overwhelmingly respond-
ed through the public forums, the 
online forums and even through 
petitions that any further increase in 
parking permit fees was not accept-

On Feb. 12, the All-Campus 
Commuter Board presented Benesch 
a petition of more than 900 signa-
tures of students opposed to any 
structure that would raise parking 
permit fees. 

In addition, 80 percent of the 
262 responses T&PS received on its 
online forum from 
faculty, admin-
istrators and stu-
dents were against 
a hike in fees.

did a great ser-

“It’s obvious that

like another park-
ing structure in the new downtown 
UCSD, but where they get the funds 
from is another issue.”

A vibrant atmosphere could be 
achieved without increased fees by 
allowing students and visitors to 
utilize Gilman Parking Structure, 
which remains relatively empty after 
5 p.m., Zertuche said.

Recent increases in parking 
prices have resulted in a $36,845 
decrease in total net revenue from 
last year.

When Chancellor Marye Anne Fox came to UCSD nearly four years ago she 
had big plans for campus diversity. 
She hired Jorge Huerta as the campus’ 
first chief diversity officer, a position 
she created in response to recom-
mendations from the Chancellor’s 
Diversity Council and the Senate-
Administration Task Force on 
Underrepresented Faculty. 

But Huerta’s work in office made 
little difference for campus diversity. 
Though the enrollment of typically 
underrepresented students increased 
during his term, that had little to do 
with any university initiatives, and out-
reach programs were continually hit 
with hard and recent budget cuts. And 
while that’s only partially his fault — 
the chief diversity officer was given no 
significant staff or fiscal resources to 
utilize — Huerta still remained almost 
purely a symbolic appointment. 

Now Sandra Daley, previously the 
assistant dean of diversity at UCSD’s 
School of Medicine, has been hired 
to fill Huerta’s shoes. And following 

suit, Daley has taken up her new post 
without any tangible goals or specific 
project plans; she said she wants to 
start by talking with students and feel-
ing out the campus climate.

But hasn’t Daley been at her post 
for a month, in addition to previ-
ously working on campus? In the past 
month students have consumed half 
a quarter’s worth of knowledge, pow-
ered through thick texts and confusing 
lab periods and completed countless 
papers and midterms. And Daley is 
still getting acclimated to her sur-
roundings? She should have come into 
office with not only a set of manage-
able goals, but a concrete plan for 
achieving them.

Looks like the beginning of anoth-
er useless term for the office. And 
that’s unfortunate, not only because 
of the arguable importance, and lack, 
of diversity at UCSD, but also because 
of all the new student-started proj-
ects and outreach initiatives. The 
Cross-Cultural, Women’s and Lesbian 
Gay Bisexual Transgender Centers, 
for example, have all been recently 

upgraded. Additionally, this year’s 
A.S. Council has made diversity a top 
priority, but think how much those 
groups would be able to accomplish 
if they had the support of a leading 
campus official.

So while all of UCSD’s tangible 
progress on diversity has been made 
by these smaller, hardworking groups, 

students are still left wondering when 
this chief officer is going to actually 
provide the change Fox promised so 
long ago. And while this board sin-
cerely hopes Daley is able to bring 
about profound improvements, mak-
ing diversity a top university priority, 
she has already proven to be sadly 
lacking.

Like any multifaceted, long-running and intensely popu-lar event, the Sun God Festival 
has developed a mythical quality, 
some amount of character that has 
been applied to the concert — and 
entire day.  

Now, Sun God Planning 
Committee members have the heady 
task of identifying and putting their 
arms around that character, in the 
hopes that they will be able to stave 
off mounting security and opera-
tional concerns.

Identifying Sun God’s student-
popular themes is easy. Drinking, 
excess and loose-minded calamity 
are ever-present on the day of the 
festival.  Unfortunately, by now the 
theme has developed into a culture, 
one that is ingrained in UCSD stu-
dents as the main impetus for Sun 
God. What could be better than 
daylong debauchery?

The committee’s response repeats 
a pipe-dreamed buzzword for this 
campus: community. Students will 
be drawn to the event if it instills 
and cultivates a sense of belonging 
and tradition. A very true, but very 
unfortunate, answer.  Unfortunately, 
establishing that sense of campus 
community is marked as the rea-
son for almost every new univer-
sity venture, from the Price Center 
expansion’s new outreach center to 
the Loft (an upcoming performance 

space). It has been used as the rea-
son for the Student Center revamp, 
and countless other projects.  

Shouldn’t we have seen dividends 
by now, or is something wrong 
with the formula? This university’s 
approach to establishing commu-
nity has always been forced, never 
achieving the natural and gradual 
process through which Sun God 
acquired its deeply seeded, albeit 
notorious, personality.

At last week’s council meet-
ing, Vice President of Student Life 
Donna Bean said the committee’s 
major factions, administrators and 
students, had reached an under-
standing over the vision and mis-
sion of Sun God. They have not 
publicized specific intentions or ini-
tiatives, which assuages many wor-
ries over the largest of changes rec-
ommended in this year’s Sun God 
Planning Report. Pushes by con-
cerned administrators and campus 
departments to change the concert’s 
date, for instance, have been tabled 
to future Sun Gods.

Their concern over nonaffili-
ates, however, makes sense. If the 
committee plans to focus on cam-
pus connectivity, curbing the non-
UCSD presence is a natural move.

But establishing consensus with-
in the committee allows the pro-
gramming department flexibility in 
directing the curatorial angles of the 

festival. Specifically, the program-
mers will have to engineer a new 
character for the festival, one that 
is more defined and an arm’s length 
away from off-brand, student-estab-
lished perceptions.

Force-feeding specific traditions 
and community-building events 
will jar students expecting a full-
out party.  Rather, programmers 
should carefully design a personal-
ity that relies on creative aspects 
of Sun God: What kind of talent is 
booked? How is it presented to the 
campus? And which image will best 
attract UCSD students? It is that 
image around which a community 
can gather.

Watching television is always my last resort. It’s not until after I have pored over my 
latest Economist, polished off a pint 
of Ben & Jerry’s or finished watching 
“Thomas Crown Affair” for the nth 
time that I even consider entering that 
inescapable state of sloth. 

Oscars night, however, is an entire-
ly different story. With the Brownie 
Batter ice cream put to rest, I forgo 
a week of world news, and I wait 
another day or so to hone my art 
thievery skills with Pierce Brosnan. It 
is an evening I actually choose to give 
the boob tube my undivided attention 
and relish in all the glitzy meaning-
lessness. 

And I’m not the only one: Over 
40 million viewers tune in to see the 
Academy Awards in the United States 
every year, and well over 100 other 
countries are licensed to broadcast the 
ceremony abroad. By many standards, 
the world is watching what many con-
sider the centerpiece of American cin-
ema. (Forget for a moment that this 
year’s ceremony boasted the lowest 
viewer pool in Oscar history.)

But behind Jon Stewart’s clever 
political zingers and the attendees’ 
flowing dresses lies an institution 
steeped in scandalous history, one that 
is rarely understood. Yes, even in spite 
of that tongue-in-cheek “documen-
tary” Academy President Sid Ganis 
presented during Sunday’s proceed-
ings — the organization responsible 
for allocating Oscars remains mysteri-
ous. Kudos for trying, though. 

So who really comprises and pulls 
the strings of this elusive organiza-
tion? 

If you hadn’t guessed already, the 
process begins with the members 
of the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences, a society of film 
industry professionals formed in 
1927. Membership is selective, and 
usually on an invitation-only basis. 
Per the mission statement, all 6,000 
members are dedicated to preserving 
Hollywood classics and developing 
new technology for filmmaking, but 
clearly the organization is best known 
for its annual awards ceremony. 

When nominating films for differ-
ent awards, Academy members first 
see movies for free at designated the-
aters or can attempt to make a dent in 
the mountain of nominee DVDs they 
receive from different sources. After 
viewing, they can proceed to nomi-
nate movies for Oscar consideration, 
provided the award category is in the 
member’s particular field of expertise. 
In other words, directors only vote for 
best director, cinematographers for 
best cinematography and so on and 
so forth. With categories that don’t 
necessarily require specialized knowl-
edge, such as documentary or foreign 
language films, committees composed 
of representatives from every branch 
of the Academy are gathered to select 
the nominees. 

For a film to be considered in 
the first place, it must meet specif-
ic requirements. Films accepted for 
review must be longer than 40 min-
utes, have had a public premiere dur-

What Makes 
‘Oscar’ Tick

See NOTA, page 5

Associate Opinion Editor

ACADEMICS — When students 
first apply to UCSD, they are pre-
sented with a list of over 100 majors 
and specializations from which they 
are to pick only one. 

For the lucky few, this is a no-
brainer. The lawyer to-be chooses 
political science or philosophy and 
the premed student eagerly clicks on 
human biology or any other science 
major that UCSD seems to have in 
abundance. 

But what about the applicants 

with more variegated interests, or 
worse, interests that aren’t easily 
translatable into a specific major? Are 
these students 
merely expect-
ed to settle for 
something they 
have little inter-
est in? Besides, 
most new appli-
cants don’t even 
have a clue as to 
what they might 
be interested in 
studying or even 
what they want 
to be doing for 
the rest of their 
life, and why should they?  UCSD 
students switch majors at least once 
during their college careers.

Thankfully, for these students, 
there is hope. All but one under-

graduate college (Sixth) offers what 
has come to be known as individual 
studies, a program whereby students 

have the opportu-
nity to conceive, 
plan and take on 
an original major 
of their own 
design. 

It has its 
restrictions, but 
it is nonetheless 
a great way for 
indecisive Tritons 
to make the best 
of a situation that 
would have other-
wise been down-

right suffocating. 
Students pursuing these indi-

vidualized programs, according 
to Thurgood Marshall Academic 
Advising Dean Anne Porter, are 

habitually “dissatisfied because of 
their creative, diverse interests” that 
no existing major can accommo-
date at UCSD. Examples of past stu-
dent-designed majors, among oth-
ers, have been education in society, 
neurophilosophy and space science 
and systems. Interestingly, several 
majors now on the list of UCSD-
sanctioned programs had, in fact, 
at one time, been individual studies 
majors, notably Japanese studies and 
Latin American tudies.

Creating a major from scratch 
is no easy undertaking, and only 
the most dedicated trailblazers need 
apply. In addition to having good 
academic standing (usually a GPA 
upwards of 3.25), students who 
enroll in ISM must develop a pro-
posal of several pages stipulating the 

A Scholastic Beacon for Dedicated, Nonconformist Tritons?
Obscure, yet beneficial, 
academic program gives 
students the opportunity 
to design their own major.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Student Group Advocates 
Concealed Weapons

Dear Editor:
Guardian senior staff writer 

Hadley Mendoza’s Feb. 24 article 
“Students Should Say Farewell, Not 
Hello, to Arms” exhibits a discon-
certing lack of understanding of the 
aim and purpose of organizations 
like Students for Concealed Carry on 
Campus. 

SCCC simply proposes allowing 
the same trained, licensed individu-
als, ages 21 and above, currently per-
mitted in 39 states to carry concealed 
handguns in virtually all other unse-
cured locations (anywhere without 
metal detectors), to carry concealed 
handguns on college campuses. Why 
should anyone assume that the same 
individuals who, on a daily basis, 
carry concealed handguns without 
incident at office buildings, movie 
theaters, grocery stores, shopping 
malls, churches, banks, etc., would 
show any less discretion or sound 
judgment while carrying concealed 
handguns on college campuses?

Contrary to Mendoza’s claims, 
nobody suggests allowing all students 
to carry guns. In most “right to carry” 
states, the rate of “concealed carry” is 
about 1 percent. That means that only 
one person out of 100 is licensed to 
carry a concealed handgun. That fact 
alone negates Mendoza’s comments 
about filling lecture halls with “well-
meaning, gun-toting” students.

Mendoza’s argument that allowing 
concealed carry on college campuses 
might lead to an increase in suicides 
is also without merit. Japan has a 
suicide rate that is more than double 
the U.S. rate, despite Japan’s virtual 
prohibition on the civilian ownership 
of firearms. Clearly, the availability 
of guns is not the determining fac-
tor in whether a person will commit 
suicide. None of the schools in Utah, 

Colorado or Virginia that currently 
allow concealed carry on campus 
have experienced any resulting sui-
cides. In fact, after allowing concealed 
carry on campus for a combined total 
of more than 60 semesters, none of 
these schools have seen any resulting 
incidents of gun violence, gun acci-
dents or gun thefts.

 Nobody is suggesting that allow-
ing concealed carry on campus is a 
panacea or magic bullet that will stop 
violence on college campuses. SCCC 
simply proposes that it is one of many 
steps that can be taken to mitigate 
school violence. Reaction and pre-
vention are not mutually exclusive. 
Allowing concealed carry on college 
campuses would take the advantage 
away from dangerous criminals who 
have no regard for school policy or 
state law.

Best Campus Security 
Looks Past Mental Health

Dear Editor,
Regarding the Feb. 24 opinion 

piece titled, “Student Should Say 
Farewell, Not Hello, to Arms,” I cer-
tainly applaud the article’s focus on 
improving mental health services for 
students. It is correct that for some 
the transition to a college environ-
ment is emotionally and mentally 
stressful. But proposing improved 
mental health services as a be-all, 
end-all solution to the problem of 
campus violence isn’t the way to go.

Improved campus security 
requires a holistic approach that 
addresses both the root causes and 
the actual actions of campus shoot-
ers. Mental health services are an 
important part of students’ well-

being, but the fact remains that in 
the case of all too many shoot-
ers — Seung-Hui Cho at Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute and State 
University, Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold from Columbine High 
School, among others — thought 
that it was the rest of the world that 
had a problem. Improving the coun-
seling services available to them 
wouldn’t have helped anyone.

I’m not sure I understand why 
the article has such a strong stance 
against lawful firearms on cam-
pus. Why are Utah and Colorado  
schools “scary”? None of the things 
the article warns about — the gun 
misuse and abuse, theft, violence or 
suicides — have occurred at any of 
those schools. 

Mental health services, campus 
alert systems, more security guards 
— none of these things will help a 
student trapped in a room with an 
active shooter. But firearms in the 
hands of licensed, trained individu-
als could make a difference.

ing the year in question, have been 
filmed in a certain film format (35 mm 
70 mm or digital) and have played in 
an Los Angeles County movie theater 
for at least seven consecutive days. 

After the nomination 
votes are in, accounting firm 
PricewaterhouseCoopers is charged 
with tabulating it all, and has done 
so in absolute secrecy for years. As 
soon as the votes are counted, the 
official nominees are announced, 
and Academy members are given 
two weeks to pick who they think is 
worthy of the Oscar. Unsurprisingly, 
during this any-
thing-goes time-
frame, film stu-
dios do everything 
in their power to 
hook Academy 
members with spe-
cial screenings or 
any other entice-
ment that may 
sway one’s vote. 

When the time 
comes for polls to 
close, so to speak, 
the second round of votes is counted 
and the names of the winners are 
sealed in envelopes and kept secret 
until the ceremony. At one time, 
newspapers were allowed to print 
the winners in their evening edi-
tions (under the assumption that 
they’d be circulated after the winners 
were announced), until newspapers 
began publishing the list earlier than 
the Academy preferred, and awards 
attendees were snatching up copies 
on their way to the proceedings to 
find out who won before they even 
reached their seats. 

Outraged, Academy authorities 
mandated that all winners be kept 
secret until the presenter opens the 
envelope and tells the world who will 

be taking home the golden statue. 
The Oscar statuette itself isn’t as 

secretive, however. The Chicago-
based R.S. Owens & Co. manu-
factures every Oscar; every one 
is totally uniform in composition 
and size: plated in 24-karat gold, 
8.5 pounds, 13.5 inches high and 
affixed to a black marble base. The 
golden figure you see represents a 
sword-wielding knight standing on 
a film reel with five spokes — each 
representing the original branches 
of the Academy.

The source of the name “Oscar” 
is hotly contested, but there is only 

one story the 
Academy recog-
nizes. Originally 
called the 
Academy Award 
of Merit, the gild-
ed statuette wasn’t 
known as the 
Oscar until two 
years after MGM 
Art Director 
Cedric Gibbons 
first conceived it 
in 1928. 

According to legend, an Academy 
librarian remarked that the gold fig-
ure resembled her uncle Oscar, and 
with the help of a Sidney Skolsky 
column that published the secretary’s 
comment, the name stuck, leading to 
the Academy’s adoption of the moni-
ker in 1939. 

With this year’s Academy Awards 
over, one might think the film 
industry is pulling up a chair and 
taking a few moments’ rest. But in 
this ever-changing and highly com-
petitive business, it only marks the 
beginning of a new year of “Oscar 
bait,” a dismissive movie-buff term 
for films that are made expressly in 
the hopes of achieving Hollywood’s 
highest accolade: ole Uncle Oscar.

The Academy Would Like 
to Thank ... a Secretary?

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2008

“intellectual and academic reasons” 
behind their decision to pursue that 
particular degree program. 

Adding to the hassle, the inter-
ested student must also consult a 
faculty member who not only agrees 
to write an approval letter for the 
proposed coursework, but also men-
tor the student throughout the entire 
process. 

Putting together a coherent, 
successful petition for an ISM can 
take up to two quarters, accord-
ing to Eleanor Roosevelt Academic 
Advising Dean Sarah Spear-Barrett. 
Not only that, but some colleges 
have additional requirements: John 
Muir College, for instance, man-
dates that all individualized majors 
culminate in a written thesis, which 
deter some. 

Unsurprisingly, very few students 
muster up the resolve to brave the 
complicated and lengthy process. 

In the experience of Catherine 
Joseph, Warren Academic Advising 
head, the ISM program at UCSD is 
something students choose to do 
“gingerly,” and by and large the num-

Individual Studies Program as Open Ended as It Is Limiting
▶ MAJOR, from page 4 bers are “very small,” with only three 

Warren College students currently 
pursuing ISMs (two of whom have 
merely expanded the already-exist-
ing law and society minor into a 
major). Even Revelle College, known 
for its academic rigorousness, has 
only seen one petition come across 
the desk of its Academic Advising 
Dean, Mirasol Española. 

As UCSD surpasses 160 majors, 
this already uncommon program is 
unfortunately becoming even more 
rare. 

While it is great that new addi-
tions to the official major list pro-
duce more and more students who 
don’t have to settle for a premade yet 
uninspiring major, the endurance 
of this sort of program on campus 
is a comforting break from UCSD’s 
usual, paralyzing impersonality. It is 
one of the last vestiges of what col-
lege should be about: the exploration 
and realization of one’s intellectual 
interests — regardless of restrictive 
major structures.

Brown University, Hampshire 
College and other forward-think-
ing schools have already taken this 

notion to heart, giving students free 
reign to determine the structure 
of their own education. Granted, 
many students do prefer to avoid 
the guesswork and simply let an 
academic department decide what 
should comprise a particular major 
program, but for others, the option 

of another course of action must be 
made available. Students who enjoy 
taking classes that are edifying but 
may not necessarily be part of a pre-
determined list of required courses 
should not be inhibited. Not only is 
this necessary for their own sense 

of personal autonomy, but many 
Tritons might find that their course 
in French literature, previously 
thought to be “superfluous,” is more 
interesting than their taxing CHEM 
6A class — leading to a potentially 
beneficial career change. 

But as with any good thing, the 
ISM program has its drawbacks. 
After all, it is not just the massive 
paperwork and obligation to ingra-
tiate oneself with professors that 
make academic advisors reluctant 
to encourage participation in the 
program. 

Graduating with a degree in bio-
logical illustrative art or health care 
& social issues (some examples of 
other past ISMs), though undoubt-
edly fulfilling for the student, poses 
problems for graduate school admis-
sion and future employment pros-
pects. 

“A graduate … program or … 
a company cannot readily identify 
what it means to be an African stud-
ies or Middle East studies major at 
UCSD, for instance … because the 
requirements for these majors are 
not something they can look up in 

the catalog,” Spear-Barrett said.
Muir College Dean of Academic 

Advising Kay Reynolds warns that 
certain Muir students have had dif-
ficulty finding work as elementary 
or even high school teachers. For 
this very reason, most of the stu-
dents who choose to create their 
own majors are already double-
majors. One of the students pursu-
ing a law & society major at Warren, 
for example, will also graduate with 
a BA in psychology, increasing his or 
her marketability. 

Disadvantages aside, UCSD’s 
individual studies program is a won-
derful opportunity for students to 
break out of the mold and discover, 
develop and embrace their true aca-
demic calling. 

It promotes individuality and 
creativity — two concepts rarely 
explored at this school of over 20,000 
students. Invoking the words of cele-
brated poet William Cowper, UCSD 
and its students must recognize that 
variety is indeed the spice of life.

Holy Fuck & A Place to Bury Strangers
THE CASBAH / MARCH 3 / 9 P.M. / $10

Let’s get the band name out of the way; yes, 
the Toronto-based organic technicians headlining 
the Casbah Monday night are called Holy Fuck, a 
slight barrier to entry for less open-minded listeners. 
Accompanying them is Brooklyn power-trio A Place 
to Bury Strangers, a gothic ’80s throwback to former 
dark-pop giants New Order that incorporates a 21st 
century noise sheen over its pleasantly derivative 
sound.

Holy Fuck gets its kicks from unconventional 
methods, concocting a techno sound palette and 
using anything from 35mm-camera noises to toy 

guns as long as it doesn’t fall into the familiar 
sample/loop framework. In “The Pulse,” all-natural 
drum-and-bass rhythms cruise along to 8-bit bleeps 
and sine swooshes, making for perfect highway 
driving tunes.

On the other hand, Strangers embrace the 
reliability of laptop-borne beats that can go for 
hours without a break, along with more soulful 
human drumming. Breathy monotone vocals poke 
out of the polished yet scruffy mix in “I’ll Know I’ll 
See You,” reinforcing their robotic themes. Now all 
these dudes need is better names.  (CK)

Straight from the 2007 Sundance Film Festival comes 
a haunting and sobering look at a history of racism still 
prevalent in today’s American South. In the wake of the Jena 
Six trial and a series of seemingly race-related murders 
in the lower quarters of the United States, filmmaker 
Marco Williams explores the modern South’s claim to 
gentle hospitality, deeming it a lie, underneath which 
is buried racial violence that still lingers between both 
black and white communities decades after the civil rights 
movement. 

Eerily reminiscent of Williams’ previous film, “Two 
Towns of Jasper,” his new documentary further shows that 
our racial troubles aren’t over, despite our reluctance to 
acknowledge them. Nominated for Sundance’s Grand Jury 
Prize, “Banished” premieres in San Diego at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in downtown La Jolla Thursday night. (CM)

A s a general rule of thumb, you can assume that any rap act coming to UCSD will leave pissed off. The reason? UCSD students suck at listening to rap. That 
said, there are still high hopes for the Federation’s upcoming per-
formance at Rock ‘n’ Roosevelt. They just might have the energy 
to get UCSD students riled up. These guys popularized — for bet-
ter or worse — the word “hyphy” with their appropriately titled 
hit song, “Hyphy.” Unlike so many other Bay Area artists, the 
Feds haven’t forgotten about hyphy music’s appeal, nor have they 
messed up the formula. They stick to Rick Rock’s synth and bass-
heavy tracks and drop surprisingly playful lyrics about how hard 
they are, or alternately, how soft you and your friends are. Perhaps 
my favorite example comes from “Playtime is Over”: “your homie 
softer than the black dude from ‘Revenge of the Nerds.’” Aren’t 
you soft for having watched “Revenge of the Nerds”?

At this point, the Feds are probably most known for their 

more recent hit, the Corey Hart-inspired “I Wear My 
Stunna Glasses at Night.” However, look forward to hear-
ing them perform “College Girl,” their failed second single 
off the latest album, It’s Whateva; they’d be crazy not to. 
Imagine Too $hort’s “Freaky Tales” if it were school-specific, 
complete with an amazing Tone Loc impression in the third 
verse. The main issue with the song is that UCSD gets no 
shout-out, while UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UC Riverside all 
get name-checked. Even lower-tier institutions like Sacramento 
State and Cal State Fullerton get mentions. I suppose I should 
direct this speech toward the ladies of UCSD, because, guys, I’m 
not sure there’s much we can do (I suppose you could try, if you 
aren’t afraid of getting mollywhopped by some third-rank rap-
pers). Ladies, I’m begging you, show these gentlemen a good 
time, and maybe — just maybe — UCSD will finally get 
a rap-song mention. Not that we deserve it. 

At the very least, UCSD, try to enjoy yourself. 
The Federation goes really hard and you 
should too. Punch a girl in the face or 
something, I don’t know. Just don’t 

stand there looking bored.

W ho knew the English were capable of so much drama? “The Other Boleyn Girl” plays like an engrossing soap opera where everyone is sleeping with everyone else and  politi-
cal backstabbing abounds. The film is so saturated in entertaining 
familial tension that you almost feel dirty enjoying other people’s 
tragic escapades. But your guilt-free twist to all these medieval 
hijinks is that most of the betrayal, sex and beheadings are pretty 
close to historical fact. So, when you feel like you’ve indulged in 
cinematic thought-junk, just remember you’ve actually gotten a 
healthy dose of history, with only a small side 
of tabloid!

Based on Philippa Gregory’s book of the 
same title, the movie is packed with historical 
appeal that’s only been slightly distorted by 
Hollywood. It chronicles the power grabs made 
by the Boleyn family during the reign of King 
Henry VIII as Papa Boleyn uses both daughters, 

Mary and Anne, like cash cows in a game of royal roulette. 
Which girl will capture the king’s heart? Or better yet, 
which girl will keep his heart? Though your high school 
history books have already chronicled Anne’s nefarious 
rise to queen-hood and subsequent beheading, “The 
Other Boleyn Girl” focuses on the less-hyped Boleyn, 
taking the hypothetical slant of a what-would-Mary-do 
variety, as it focuses on the role she could have played in 
all of the political volleying.

Meek and pawn-like, Scarlett 
Johansson plays Mary like a well-
trained mouse, cowering in quiet 
beauty that renders her angelically 
benign. Every scene is front-loaded 
with a heavy dose of her big baby 
blues that scream helplessly for some

A s more games attempt to elimi-nate the bound-
aries that limit our interactivity with 

the medium, they become increasingly 
aware of their own potential. In doing so, 

they’ve succumbed to many of the restrictions 
that such ambitions possess. One of the drawbacks 

of an interactive medium is the overextension of cre-
ativity. Games have become more ambitious in terms of 

user interaction. As compelling as a game’s concept may be, 
the idea is only as strong as its execution. When hype is driven 

by potential, the game is suddenly judged on its ability to meet, if not 
exceed, it. Though they often become bestsellers, they also never seem to 

follow with their promises thus disappointing many gamers who’ve pinned 
their hopes upon such games. 
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was one of the most brilliant adventure/plat-

forming games to have graced our 
generation, and despite its merits, the 

title’s most defining attribute was its freerun-
ning feature. Yet no matter how compelling the 

feature, it was always limited to the game’s environ-
ment. So when the masterminds behind Sands of Time 

announced they were starting work on a new title that prom-
ised to take this defining feature into an open gaming universe, 

you can imagine the gaming world’s excitement. What the game 
eventually became was Assassin’s Creed, one of the most ambitious, and 

ultimately disappointing, games of this generation.
I applaud the game’s attempt to create a huge and dynamic playground for 

which to parkour into ecstasy, but the playground is meaningless if you can’t do 
anything inside it. The problem with Assassin’s Creed is that developers forgot they were 

making an actual game. Truth be told, what the game did right, it did it in awesome fashion. 
Freerunning is one of the most enjoyable features I’ve ever experienced in any videogame.  
However, it’s the only feature that the game 
gets right. Though the actual assassinations 
are genuinely fun — if not an annoying les-
son in the dangers of repetition — they only 
comprise about 5 percent of the game. To 
compensate, the developers thought it clever 
to have gamers redo the same chores before 
every mission. Interesting at first, the appeal 
of the tasks becomes increasingly stale as the 
missions go on, wherein players are suddenly 
aware that the only thing that changes about 
the tasks is the irritability level. 

No matter how ambitious Assassin’s Creed was, it can’t hold a candle to Peter Molyneux. 
Molyneux could easily be described as the industry’s most ambitious game developer, and 
he’s been more than outspoken in his attempts to incorporate elements of morality and 
emotion into his games. While Black & White was Molyneux’s first attempt at this, it was 
Fable that tried to implement moral choices and consequences into the actual design. Yet 
because morality is such a complicated thing to tackle, Fable ends up a mediocre RPG, too 
ambitious for its own good.

N o one can love a girl with a pig’s shnoz. It’s borderline bestiality. Not even the mother who gave birth to the second coming of Miss 
Piggy could love that face — but never mind all that. 
The message of modern-day fairytale “Penelope” is 
not that you’ll eventually meet someone who will like 
you despite your upturned and fleshier-than-normal 
snout; rather, instead of staying on the prowl for that 
someone, you’ve gotta like way you are first. 

Penelope Wilhern (Christina Ricci) is a blue-
blood aristocrat who just happens to have a pig 
snout. The film starts off with a whirlwind pre-title 
sequence, which reveals that the titular character’s 
porcine features are a result of a family curse. 

Generations back, a male Wilhern screws over a 
maid by knocking her up but never marrying her, 

and this maid’s mother — who happens to be the 
town witch — places a curse upon the Wilhern fam-

ily: The next girl born to a Wilhern will be a little 
porker. Luckily, male Wilhern came after male 

Wilhern. That is, until Penelope was born.
Living in a celebrity-obsessed culture, 

Penelope’s parents Jessica and Franklin 
(Catherine O’Hara and Richard E. Grant) 
fake the infant’s death to hide her from 
prying tabloids. Penelope grows up iso-
lated in her manor attic, surrounded by 
fake scenery and enough knick-knacks 
to fill FAO Schwartz. For a pig girl 
confined to solitude, she’s pretty well 
adjusted and charming.

The only way for Penelope to break 
the curse is for “one of her own” to love 
her; the Wilherns interpret this as a 
need for another blue-blood socialite 
to marry Penelope and quickly set up 
every rich boy to court her. 

Unfortunately, once she reveals her 
face to a suitor, he takes the quick-
est route out (usually through a sec-
ond story window). Truth is, though, 
Penelope really isn’t that nasty-looking. 
There’s no justification in hurling your-
self through stained glass after seeing her; 
Ricci actually looks pretty cute with pig 
nostrils.

The story gets rolling when Lemon 
(the diminutive but apt Peter Dinklage), 

a tabloid reporter who 
has been following the 
Penelope story, hatches a 
scheme with laughable 
Edward Vanderman (Simon 
Woods), to get a photo of 
Penelope for Page One. 
Knowing the curse, they 
hire Max Campion (dream-
boat James McAvoy), a 

down-and-out rich boy plagued by gambling woes, 
to court Penelope and get the picture. Upon confron-
tation though, Max falls for Penelope’s charms and 
doesn’t follow through with the plan.

“Penelope” takes place in a not-quite-real time-
less London where national identity is distorted with 
a jumble of American, British and New England 
accents, with rotary phones and antique typewrit-
ers still in use. It’s saturated with an array of visu-
ally pleasing, vibrant colors reminiscent of the work 
done by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Tim Burton. 

And like Jeunet’s and Burton’s films, “Penelope” 
mashes fairytale fantasy and modern reality to create 
a fable that leaves a strange, warm feeling inside you 
despite the obvious fact that there’s no way someone 
can love a human-pig hybrid. Nevertheless, you will 
still fall for its charm, cutesy message and all. Don’t 
worry — this loving’s kosher.

The Raveonettes
■ Lust Lust Lust
FIERCE PANDA

I t might seem a little excessive, not to men-tion repetitive, for Scandinavian duo the Raveonettes to list lust three times on their 
fourth LP, but it proves every bit an indicator of 
the excitement inside. It’s a rush to hear a killer 
tune, but even more so when you realize that the 
band has stumbled upon a solid combination of 
style and musical cohesiveness.

Where past efforts like Chain Gang of Love and 
Pretty in Black were stunted and uneven, Lust Lust 
Lust is a true album in the finest sense, working 
both track-by-track and as a complete body of 
work. Certain circles dismissed Sune Rose Wagner 
and Sharin Foo’s ominous, wall-of-sound spectacle 
as a knockoff of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s nostal-
gia for darkly glossed pop-rock. Now they have to 
place the band as the rightful heirs to the throne.

After bursting through the doors with “Aly, 
Walk With Me” — an edgy, sunglasses-cool tune 
befitting certain slow-motion walks in film — the 
band heads into familiar, if somewhat more 

controlled territory with “Hallucinations” and 
the magnetically catchy “Dead Sound.” And the 
surefire stamp of the Raveonettes’ tunesmith 
blossoming: the ability to maintain the same 
foreboding sweetness with heavy reverb and still 
keep each song a distinguishable necessity. The 
duo flips between a more low-down, bubblegum 
walk on “Black Satin,” sugar-rushed pop on “You 
Want the Candy” and the triumphal blasts of 
standout “Blitzed,” coated in simple Duane Eddy-
styled guitar chords, which soak you in sweeping, 
divine epiphany.

The album is revelatory — manic and peace-
ful, balancing gloomy, suicidal depression with 
a wide-eyed smile at transcendent beauty, like 
standing on your street in the winter’s midnight 
fog, staring at the afterglow of a car’s high beams 
just about to curve around the bend.

I n No Kids’ group photo on the back of Come Into My House, something delight-fully awkward resonates with the seemingly 
forced smiles of the rosy-cheeked woman, 
balding man and gawky lad with spectacles. 
From the looks of it, who would’ve known 
that this side project of lo-fi pop collective 
P:ano was packing a bit of sexy? Mmm yes, 
because nothing makes a girl swoon more 
than a sultry sounding fellow accompanied by 
baby-making beats.

The classical- and jazz-influenced track 
“Great Escape” does just that. Nick Krgovich’s 
wistful vocals over a beautifully syncopated 
score of snares, keys, strings and horns is eeri-
ly dreamlike; close your eyes, and you’ll find 
yourself in one of Michel Gondry’s whimsical 
films flying on a toy pony or erasing memo-
ries of a shitty lover. 

“Bluster in the Air” is another between-
the-sheets” track, blending reserved falsettos 

and orchestration with the right amount of 
crisp electronic beats to excite Prince fans 
(minus the purple velvet suit and ruffled 
blouse). But it’s not until “The Beaches Are 
Closed” that listeners half expect to hear 
an old-school bump ‘n’ grind Janet Jackson 
hook, rich in kick drum reverb that puts this 
young Vancouver band’s album alongside 
indie-pop sensation Rilo Kiley’s Under the 
Blacklight.

From the random, party-down Architecture 
in Helsinki-esque handclaps to Krgovich’s 
charming vocals, No Kids makes a provoca-
tive breakthrough debut with its avant-garde 
compositional work that feeds listeners’ insa-
tiable lust for chill evening tunes or hipster 
pop ballads. So get dolled up and light the 
candles — it’s going to be a good night.

Janet Jackson
■ Discipline
ISLAND DEF JAM

D on’t ask us how Janet Jackson does it. You’d think that after 10 studio albums polished to understated sex-kitten perfection, the ab-queen of the pop universe would be drained of sass. 
But we should learn to have more faith in the woman who has 
survived mass nipple slippage and rollercoaster fat fluctuations. In 
Discipline, she rips to shreds her 20-year-old weaknesses, return-
ing to the heavy lidded ’80s sensuality that doesn’t grind your face 
off (Britney) or ballad-break the windows (Mariah), but whispers 
dirty little secrets in your ear in true Janet fashion. 

Nope, it’s clear that Ms. Jackson hasn’t lost an ounce of her 
sweaty sexual prowess; her horny panting and auto-tuned plead-
ing are louder than ever. Sure, Rihanna might be half her age, but 
Dupri’s muse has clearly sharpened her cougar claws and pushed 
her to the front of the pack. “Feedback,” the album’s premier single, 
pretty much sums it up: she’s “heavy like a first-day period.” With 

pumping house beats, a reverberating bass line and Janet moaning 
“sexy, sexy, sexy” in her trademark, close-to-monotone breathiness, 
it’s hard to disagree — this kind of comeback is as unavoidable as 
Aunt Flo’s monthly visits. 

The next single from the plastic surgeon puppet (at least she’s 
still vaguely black-looking, right?) will most likely be “Luv,” a three-
minute car accident-lust metaphor (“Sparks turned into flames/ 
should have stopped at the red light”) punctuated by a hypnotizing 
“luv, luv, luv-luv-luv” chant over squeaky tech backing. Then again, 
the next hit could also be the equally dance-worthy “2nite” — a 
crossbreed of old Janet (see: “Nasty Boys”) with a new, strobe light-
inspired Janet. This one definitely sees sweaty gay boy worship in 
its near future — then again, the entire album will undoubtedly 
inspire a faithful homo-cult following.

The only disappointing lows in Discipline are the boring R&B 

ballads that are essentially filler. It’s like Janet paused for a water 
break between heart-racing aerobic workouts, and halfheart-
edly mumbled some insipid refrain for Dupri to play with (“Never 
Letchu Go”). More disturbing, though, is when she looks to her 
inner Penny Gordon on the title track, “Discipline.” Sorry, but a 
shivering little girl begging “daddy” to “make [her] cry,” “take off all 
[her] clothes” and “be the teacher,” among other creepy requests, is 
not sexy. It’s just not. 

Overall, you’ve gotta give Janet her much-deserved credit. What 
fountain of eternal youth has the woman been greedily gulping? 
Will she ever go through menopause? Probably not … I suspect 
she’ll always be first-day period heavy.

■ Seventh Tree
MUTE

V isualizing Goldfrapp’s musical history as a dreamlike journey, we start with a porcelain doll atop a unicorn, pranc-
ing ’round lush mountain forests. Past the 
Brothers Grimm scenery, our pixie finds a 
dance floor illuminated by disco ball spasms; 
suddenly, lighting shocks the crooning synth-
pop princess, pumping her ’70s vocals with 
brassy sex purrs.

But here’s where our voyage takes an 
unexpected twist — without warning, our 
pixie stops mid-romp, smears the mascara off 
her wide eyes, and abandons feral dancing to 
go skinny dipping in more sedated waters.

Admittedly, the change is off-putting. 
Goldfrapp’s commercially and critically suc-
cessful release in 2006, Supernature, man-
aged to fuse the pretty flourishes of their first 
effort, Felt Mountain, and the theatrical glam 
of 2003’s Black Cherry. It seemed they had 
finally discovered the magical formula that 
crafs electro-perfection.

So why ditch it for a stark, folksy devia-
tion? While we may never fully anticipate 
this shape-shifting Brit sensation, their new-
est album works — although it’s hard to 
confess that Seventh Tree’s acoustic, sensual 
landscapes are as profoundly enjoyable as the 
volatile club beats we’ve come to expect.

Propelling Seventh Tree’s ballads to ethe-
real heights is Allison Goldfrapp, the siren 

whose delicate vocals tease the opening 
track, “Clowns,” lingering on gossamer sym-
phonic surges. Will Gregory (the duo’s key-
boardist and synthesizer) colors her words 
with piano burbles and faint electro static. 
Where “Clowns” meanders and floats away, 
the bouncy “Happiness” is easier to follow 
— though no less druggy and distant-sound-
ing, with its breathy “love, love, love” and 
theremin-meets-tambourine chorus. 

Seven songs into the album, we discover 
the hippy delight of the first single, “A&E,” 
which recalls little girls wearing daisy-chain 
crowns and running through cornfields. It’s 
understated, but decidedly charming enough 
to appeal to a radio audience. 

So is “Caravan Girl,” which fights the 
diluted drowsiness of the album with catchy 
refrains and sing-song, Eisley-like harmo-
nies.

It would be dishonest to say that the thrill 
of blasting wildly sultry beats like “Ooh La 
La” and “Lovely to See You” is passe, but 
maybe Goldfrapp has decided that the time 
has come to leave behind the disco ball and 
deliver a more subdued, grown-up sound. We 
just hope that a fifth album leaves a tad more 
wiggle room for go-go dancing.

B orn Ruffians are primary colors brought to musical life; when exposed in large doses, they make you feel warm, fuzzy 
and just plain giddy inside. With all the 
bouncy Modest Mouse-esque choral hollers 
in the background and catchy “la dee das,” 
“fa la las” and “ah oh o-whoahs” sprinkled 
throughout, the Toronto trio has something 
golden with their debut Red Yellow & Blue.

If there is such a thing as pure, unadulter-
ated happiness in the world, Born Ruffians 
have found it and added guitar and drums. 

The titular track starts off with guttural 
“uhs,” followed by a tinkling of the ivories 
and a cheery fife-like whistle. Singer Luke 
LaLonde then asks the perennial childhood 
question over a martial drumbeat, “If I start-
ed my own country, what flag colors would 
I use?” It is a cute thought that reflects the 
album’s simple, wistful and goofy feel.

LaLonde and company give a winsome 
approach to life’s various dealings. The sev-
enth track, “Foxes Mate for Life,” is their 
ode to love, making us humans analogous to 
these furry counterparts by saying they stick 

with monogamy ’cause they’re just so damn 
in love like we should be. 

Alternating time signatures and shifting 
cadences add fun touches to the tracks and 
help bring a thoroughly carefree feeling that 
leaves you wanting a field to frolic in. 

In “Hummingbird,” after a myriad of 
instruments near the end of their noise-
making, LaLonde and his choir exclaim, “Fly 
away little hummingbird!” before the music 
collapses into an upheaval of various string 
and brass instruments. What could better 
represent the simple juvenile joy of silently 
stalking a diminutive creature and then scar-
ing the bejesus out it?

Red Yellow & Blue was produced by Rusty 
Santos, known for his goods with Panda 
Bear and Animal Collective, whose albums 
we can safely assume the boys of Born 
Ruffians own. If you’re looking for Pan’s 
Never Neverland, look no further than the 
Ruffians’ tri-colored rainbow sound.

A bout a year ago, Bay Area legend Yukmouth bought a massive ad in the Source announcing the release of his 
new album, Million Dollar Mouthpeice. Well, 
a year — and maybe a couple of spell checks 
— later, the album is finally out without any 
typographical errors in the title.

The first track, “West Coast Don,” contin-
ues the Yukmouth tradition of awfully exe-
cuted cinematic intros (listen to Godzilla to 
see what I mean). This time, Yukmouth does 
his best Vito Corleone impression. Simply 
put, Don Yuk is mad at the state of West 
Coast rap because “guys are fucking up.”

Yukmouth has reason to be mad: He 
bumped Michael Jackson from the charts 
years ago with “I Got Five On It,” and hasn’t 
made waves outside the Bay Area since. To 
put things in perspective, that song is so 
famous that Yuk still enjoys a strong follow-
ing in Germany (“Ich Bin High, Homey,” 
the German remix to “Five On It,” is truly 
surreal). 

On this album, Yuk does what Yuk knows 
best — bragging about his clothes and his 
jewelry; if you let him tell the story, he has a 
lot of the best kinds of both. 

However, Yukmouth steps out of his com-
fort zone on this album, rapping over a beat 
from Young L of the Pack on “Shine Like Me.” 
He even has some bizarrely honest and, dare 
I say, tender moments on “Star in the Sky,” 
where Yuk describes growing up the son of 
a crack addict and sleeping on the streets. 
It’s surprisingly touching stuff from the man 
whose most romantic song to date is called 
“Kidnap U.”

This album doesn’t quite solve all the 
problems that West Coast rap has been deal-
ing with (sorry, Don Yuk); in all honesty it 
will get little play outside of the Bay Area 
and Munich (I’m serious about this). But if 
you are a Yukmouth fan, you’ll enjoy every-
thing from the street bangers, like the clev-
erly named “Drug Dealer,” to the incredibly 
cheesy Yuk club songs, like “Make it Rain.”

Perhaps the only serious letdown is that 
Yukmouth is not wearing a stolen G-Unit 
chain on the cover of the album, which he 
had promised to do a couple years back. 
Maybe next time.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28TH

By Jenna Brogan
Staff Writer

R ecreating the 1970s a la “Anchorman” — but with more lingo, faux-glam and over-the-top extravagance that characterized the decade — “Semi-Pro” tells of 
basketball owner/coach/player Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) 
who attempts to get his team, the Flint Tropics, success-
fully inducted into the NBA after word comes that their 
own conference is merging with the league. With team-
mates Coffee Black (André 3000) and Monix (Woody 
Harrelson) working hard with Moon to boost game atten-
dance and morale with publicity stunts, the film is ulti-
mately a mess of slapstick barf scenes, sex, Russian rou-
lette and occasional free-throws which prove simply dis-
appointing and drawn out. Like its last photocopy, “Blades 

of Glory,” “Semi-Pro” 
is just “Another Will 
Ferrell Movie,” the 
classic stock of which you’ve undoubtedly already seen. 
It’s a shame that it has to come to us from Kent Alterman, 
producer of the genius “Elf,” who’s now trying his rookie 
hand at the directing game.

Oh, Will Ferrell, what were you thinking? Some les-
sons for future screenplay selection: 

1. Choose a movie you haven’t done before: An actor’s 
filmography shouldn’t resemble the “Land Before Time” 
series. That is, all projects shouldn’t have similar plots 
with similar characters and similar themes. It’s not a good 
sign when your fans can say this movie was better than 
“Blades of Glory,” which was way worse than “Talladega 
Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” which was worse than 
“Old School,” which was about as funny as “Anchorman,” 
which was better than all that other crap on your resume. 
If the glory days on SNL and a YouTube video called “The 
Landlord” have provided most of your popularity, we’ve 
got a serious problem.

2. If it’s comedy, it better be funny: Should your 
trademark happen to be that your flicks are some of 

the most quotable in the industry, you might want 
to pick a screenplay that isn’t littered with arbitrary 
swearing purely for the sake of distracting from the 
recognizable lack of wit. Sure, it usually doesn’t take 
much for Ferrell to make people laugh; after all, 
he’s memorable for making stupidity funny again, 
running around shamelessly with his junk hanging 
out for laughs and all. However, screenwriters have 
to provide something clever to say right as he trips. 
Just because people are laughing, Will, doesn’t mean 
they aren’t listening to the words coming out of your 
mouth.

Choose a script where a goofy afro and skimpy 
shorts don’t have to do all the work. While your 
Chewbacca-hairy chest, jelly donut tummy rolls 
and irresistible sideburns will do the trick for now, 
it won’t be long till people realize something’s miss-
ing.

3. Three consecutive sports parodies is not 
a charm. NASCAR racing? Check. Ice skat-
ing? Check. Basketball? Check. And who 
could forget that flop of a family comedy a 
couple years back, “Kicking and Screaming” 
… Soccer? Check. Yep, you’ve done it all. 
Come on, what’s next, water ballet? We get 
it already! You have an unexplainable obses-
sion with sports and winners and underdog 
sport winners. Isn’t it time to move on? You 
thought you had us all fooled with the serious 

“Stranger than Fiction,” teasing your fans into thinking 
that you were in fact a multifaceted actor — but once 
again, you pulled the rug out from under us. Our hearts 
can hardly take it anymore, Will.

Pretty Girls Make for Juicy Sisterly
Drama in Front-Page Tabloid Fodder
strong, muscley rescuer. In stark contrast is the badass 
maneuvering and charm of Natalie Portman’s Anne, 
who, within 30 minutes, grabs control of the fam-
ily and leaves Johansson looking like a sheep to her 
wolf. It’s no surprise, considering that at 13, Portman 
was sidekick to a hitman in “The Professional,” while 
Johansson was being nursed back to health in “The 
Horse Whisperer.” Talented as she may be, it’s sadly 
familiar to see Johansson in the role of a besieged beauty 
wimping rather than fighting it out. Sure, she’s pretty, but 
maybe her easy good looks could take a break like Nicole 
Kidman in “The Hours,” or maybe she could choose a 
role where her character kicks someone with conviction. 
Think about it, Johansson: baby steps.

Anne is the more compelling character, willing to go 
to any lengths to secure her man and status as queen; 
Mary serves as the convenient shadow that observes a 
plot moving merrily along without her. She is only “the 
other girl,” after all, so maybe a waif-like obedience to 
fate is what Gregory was going for. Yet it still feels a little 
cheap when Mary moves from involved catalyst to sym-
pathetic hand holder. 

Her ying to Anne’s yang doesn’t ruin the thrill of the 
Boleyn brood’s violent rise in court, but it does make 

you want to strangle Mary when she forgives Anne so 
easily. If your sister sleeps with your man, it seems pretty 
evident why you shouldn’t forgive that ho.

Then there’s the curious casting of hottie Eric Bana as 
the notoriously rotund British monarch. Any kid from 
your first period world history class can tell you Henry 
VIII was a brute made of cellulite and baby-making 
dreams, so the choice of hunky Bana is pretty random. 

But even if Hollywood did step in and make a couple 
of purely aesthetic casting choices, the end results aren’t 
so far from a reasonable truth that you’d get distracted.

What “Boleyn” does do is deliver a captive quality 
that makes forgiving its historical liberties not only bear-
able but damn near juicy as well. So what if Anne Boleyn 
is rumored to have had six fingers on her left hand and 
Portman only has normal digits? The story is so engross-
ing and the acting is of such pure quality that most of 
the errors go unnoticed. Its nonflashy style plants the 
intrigue center stage, right above its pretty costumes and 
elaborate shots of the rolling English countryside. 

By the film end’s, the snazzy gear and English 
upheaval merely fade into the background of Anne’s 
tragic fate. Love or hate her, Anne is still the most 
historically interesting Boleyn. Sucks to be you, Mary 
“what’s-her-face” Boleyn.

Flying Lotus
■ Reset
WARP

O ftentimes when listening to uninspired MTV or radio dribble, I wonder when artists stopped being artists. Then I hear 
someone like Flying Lotus. This Los Angeles 
beat-maker is truly pushing boundaries and 
exploring new territory through his off-kil-
ter drum programming and experimental 
approach. While his debut instrumental album, 
1983, had more of what is commonly known as 
down-tempo rhythms and ambient moods, his 
newest EP, Reset, brings a more cohesive direc-
tion to the sound. The EP is succinct, barely 
reaching the 15-minute mark in the span of five 
tracks. But in that small amount of space, Lotus 
successfully gives a rhythmic backbone to his 
strange yet appealing sounds. 

“After releasing 1983, I felt like I wanted to 
start over on a new label and introduce myself 
as a producer that did more than just one kind 
of vibe so it won’t be too weird for anyone 
down the line that wasn’t expecting me to do 
some different kind of shit,” Lotus said of his 

newest release. 
When questioned as to whether he has any 

apprehension about switching styles too fast 
and possibly losing some of the attention he 
has garnered lately, Lotus brushed off the pos-
sibility of pigeon-holing himself.

“I’m not at all afraid of switching up my 
style,” he said. “I really hope that folks expect 
that from me. I really hope that people expect 
me to do all sorts of things; I really don’t want 
to do one thing forever.”

If you have any sort of interest in sounds 
not found in mainstream channels, give Flying 
Lotus a listen. His incorporation of elements 
from different forms of electronic music and 
hip-hop, all while pushing forward to carve 
his own lane, make for beats that knock and 
arrangements that will have you scratching 
your head in awe.

A s suggested by the instruments scattered on the CD’s inside sleeve, excluding the naked women on the cover, Throw Me the Statue’s 
Moonbeams features a synth keyboard’s sundry 
sounds, a melodica’s distinctive high pitch and 
a bass guitar’s infectious ambience that mixes it 
up on every track. Hailing from the ever-evolv-
ing Seattle music scene, the nearly one-man 
band of Scott Reitherman dabbles with genres 
ranging from Shins and Clap Your Hands-
esque indie pop to more folky tones that evoke 
Venezuelan extraordinaire Devendra Banhart. 
Properly sprinkled with the chipper tune of a 
glockenspiel throughout the album, Moonbeams 
leaves you yearning for lazy afternoon naps or 
bicycle rides down to Black’s Beach.

Rather than lagging with an overindulgent 
one-minute buildup into the first track, “Young 
Sensualists” immediately introduces an up-
tempo synth keyboard melody, tossing listeners 
back into ninth grade, where they first held 
hands with their lusty, pubescent lovers. Keeping 

up with the never-too-cute yet never-too-serious 
theme, “Lolita” is a shoulder-moving carousel of 
mixed percussions for those too shy to dance 
with the crowd. Although it still features the 
delightful, nostalgic glockenspiel, “Conquering 
Kids” strays from indie and electro conventions 
and instead embraces subtle, sultry lead guitar in 
the vein of Jack Johnson. Perhaps the most strik-
ing resemblance, however, is Reitherman’s voice 
to that of Casiotone for the Painfully Alone’s 
Owen Ashworth. It’s especially true in “Yucatan 
Gold,” where he falls out of key but returns to 
form before the smartly symphonic end.

Moonbeams shouldn’t be mistaken as an 
unorganized mess; rather it’s an eclectic, pol-
ished arrangement of Crayola crayon ditties 
intertwined with bushy bearded folk tunes that 
deserves every bit of attention the cover’s naked 
women do.

Throw Me the Statue
■ Moonbeams
SECRETLY CANADIAN

Of Molyneux’s many promises of Fable’s potential, few were 
actually implemented. The game’s biggest selling point was its 
freedom of choice, and it does a wonderful job in crafting that 
illusion. Truthfully, the choices you make only amount to how 
heroic or demonic you become; there is never any middle-
ground to your morality. The only choice in the game that 
exists is whether you want to be either the world’s greatest civil 
servant or the world’s biggest douchebag. Though the types of 
quests you choose may change with your character’s morality, 
the actual game is completely linear, with a world that never 
seems to age along with you.

It’s hard to be convinced that my actions have consequences  
if the world around me refuses to change. It’s like being con-
stantly trapped in a time bubble, only I’m tragically exempt 
from everlasting youth. 

Describing these two grandiose games brings me to the point; 

the ambition of Spore. Ambitious doesn’t even begin to describe 
what Will Wright intends to do with this title. Wright, creator 
of the phenomenal Sims franchise, aims to beat out not only 
Molyneux in ambition but also every game developer who has 
promised bigger and better things. Dubbed “Sim everything,” the 
game will attempt to imitate the stages of evolution. Essentially, 
the entire game is divided into five stages known as the cell, 
creature, tribal, civilization, and space stages. You’re able to create 
and control the evolution of a species, and each stage will provide 
gameplay distinctive to that particular level. Yet a greater aspect 
of Wright’s ambition comes in the inclusion of a Spore encyclo-
pedia, aptly titled the “Sporepedia.” Unlike typical multiplayer 
affairs, the Sporepedia will allow you to share your species with 
other players.

Not only that, the game will give you the option to select other 
species to inhabit your world. The feature will also implement a 
function called the Sporecast which will constantly update you 

with information about the most popular species — you can even 
choose to subscribe to the creations of a specific player. It’s a sort 
of social networking built into the game, with ambitions of file 
and video sharing along with community filters not unlike those 
found in YouTube.

Spore is not just ambitious but potentially revolutionary. 
However, with promises of ambition comes the standard expec-
tations and disappointment. While I applaud games that are 
becoming more and more ambitious, how many Assassin’s 
Creeds or Fables can I possibly bear? Despite my fears, how-
ever, I’m glad that these games exist. Without their attempts to 
further develop the industry, games wouldn’t be as evolutionary 
and radical. Though many of these games have arguably been 
disappointments, if more and more games like Spore become 
successful, perhaps the general public will see our industry as a 
viable medium. Hopefully Spore’s success can convince people of 
the craft’s potential.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  15

Franco led the Tritons offensively, 
going 4-for-5 with a homer, three 
runs scored and three RBIs. Junior 
third-baseman Justin Bono came 
in as a defensive replacement in 
the sixth and hit a grand slam one 
inning later.

With the 
wins, the Tritons 
improve to 13-3 
overall and 3-0 in 
their early con-
ference schedule. 
Prior to the series, 
UCSD held the 
16th ranking in 
Division II but 
was bumped up 
to ninth after the 
impressive series 
win.

“My stock 
answer is that 
[the rankings] 
don’t mean any-
thing,” O’Brien said. “But at the same 
time, we worked really hard to get 
the program to this point. And so 
I’m very proud to get that respect 
from the other coaches in the nation 
and I think our players should be 

very proud to put themselves in this 
position. And I think it’s great for 
us to have that bullseye on our back 
and to play the whole season under 
those circumstances. It’s only going 
to make us better.”

UCSD will next host Cal Poly 
Pomona for two games on Feb. 28 and 

Feb. 29 before trav-
eling to Pomona 
for a doublehead-
er on March 1 in 
the start of twelve 
straight league 
games. 

“There are no 
weekends off in 
our conference,” 
O’Brien said. 
“Anybody in our 
conference on 
any given day can 
give you a heck of 
a game. But if we 
just play our game 
and execute to our 

capabilities, I don’t think there’s any-
body we can’t beat on any given 
day.”

UCSD again lost the rebounding bat-
tle, 22-18, and committed 18 turn-
overs, compared to 14 for CSUSB.

“We really just had to step up 
the defensive intensity and take away 
some of the things we know [CSUSB] 
likes to do, namely feeding the post 
and offensive rebounding,” Allard 
said. “We let the teams shoot way 
to good of a percentage this week-
end, and we have to try to make our 
opponents uncomfortable. Plus, our 
defense feeds into our offense when 
we are playing well, so that is the basis 

for the success of our team.”
The Tritons will conclude their 

regular season and attempt to secure 
a home playoff game as they travel 
to Cal State Monterey Bay today and 
San Francisco State on Feb. 29. Both 
games are slated for 7:30 p.m. tip-offs. 
UCSD will clinch a home game in 
the CCAA Tournament Quarterfinals 
with either a weekend sweep or one 
win and help from other conference 
members.

had 10 saves for the Tritons.
“We were able to hold [the 

Gauchos] off because we were 
rotating players in and out and 
were able to take breaks while they 
were getting tired,” sophomore two-
meter defender Stephanie Bocian 
said. “Also, we were ready to play 
and we executed on defense and on 
offense.”

The tournament’s opening game 
pitted the Tritons against the No. 2 
team in the nation. UCSD faced a 
tough Stanford team, scoring only 
three goals. The Tritons suffered 
a 10-3 loss to the Cardinal before 
facing another top-10 opponent in 
UC Irvine.

Defense played a major role 
in the first quarter of the Tritons’ 
game against UC Irvine as the first 
eight-minute period ended with the 
game still scoreless. The Tritons 
scored first in the match with a 
goal from junior attacker Sydney 
Gstettenbauer with 3:39 left in 
the second quarter. The Anteaters 
answered back to tie the game at 
1-1 and two more Anteater goals 

gave UC Irvine a 3-1 lead entering 
halftime.  

With 6:54 left in the third quar-
ter, Bloom scored a goal to cut UC 
Irvine’s lead to 3-2. The Anteaters 
came back with three unanswered 
goals, handing the Tritons a 6-2 
loss.

UCSD’s third game of the tour-
nament against No. 15 University 
of Michigan ended in an overtime 
defeat for the Tritons, as they fell to 
Michigan 11-10. 

The high-scoring match started 
with Michigan taking a 4-3 lead 
after the first quarter. The Tritons 
finally caught up by outscoring 
Michigan in the third quarter. 
Both teams scored two goals in the 
fourth period to send the game into 
overtime.

Michigan and UCSD each scored 
two goals in the first overtime peri-
od, giving each team a clean slate 
heading into the final overtime 
period. Both teams remained quiet 
offensively until Michigan netted 
the winning goal with 51 seconds 
left in the period. The Tritons were 
unable to come up with a score, 

leading to their third defeat of the 
tournament. Gstettenbauer scored 
four goals for the Tritons in the 
loss.

Even though they lost three 
out of four games in the tourna-
ment, the Tritons still did better 
than expected against high-ranked 
opponents.

“We improved on how we played 
those teams in the past,” Hockett 
said. “All the teams we played are 
ranked above us, so we were expect-
ed to lose. I’m not too disappointed 
with how we played.”

The Tritons will return home 
to face Cal State Bakersfield and 
Pomona-Pitzer on March 1. UCSD 
hopes to use those games to improve 
on its current 4-10 record.

“If we play our game then we 
should have no problem win-
ning those games,” Hockett said. 
“Bakersfield is known to be a scrap-
py and dirty team so if we stay com-
posed and not play at their level, we 
should be fine.”

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2008

BASEBALL — The No. 9 UCSD 
baseball team opened its California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
schedule with three straight wins 
over Cal State San Bernardino 
before the finale of the four-game 
series was rained out on Feb. 24.

The series started with the 
Tritons exploding for 13 runs to 
open their conference schedule with 
a big win in front of a home crowd 
on Feb. 21. The teams then took 
a day off before UCSD traveled to 
San Bernardino for a doublehead-
er on Feb. 22. The Triton offense 
was clicking once again, as UCSD 
scored 22 runs in two more wins. 
The day’s first game ended in a 
10-5 UCSD victory and the second 
game lasted only seven innings due 
to rain delays but saw the Tritons 
barely come away with a 12-11 win 
in the nightcap.

“It was great to start with three 
wins in conference; I think it was 
more important to get the wins 
the way we did,” head coach Dan 
O’Brien said. “Our guys showed a 
tremendous amount of character 
and competitiveness and I was just 
very impressed with they way they 
handled adversity throughout the 
weekend.”

While the Tritons didn’t get a 
chance to complete the four-game 
sweep, they did showcase their 
offensive firepower in every game 
of the series, totaling 35 runs in 
three games. In the 12-11 win, the 

Tritons barely eked out a win after 
exploding for 10 runs in the third 
inning.

“As good as we swung the bats 
this weekend I think we can be even 
better,” O’Brien said. “If our guys 
continue to focus on getting better 
everyday and having quality at bats 
as the season goes on, we could 
have a pretty phenomenal offense.”

Despite the offensive burst, 
UCSD nearly lost the game after 
its normally reliable relief corps 
allowed six runs over 6.2 innings on 
top of the five runs that junior start-
ing pitcher Trevor Decker gave up 
in just a third of the innings. Keith 
Noe was the first relief pitcher able 
to stifle the Coyotes, as he pitched 
the final 4.1 innings, allowing only 
one run to earn the win.

In the other two wins, the 
Tritons did not have to deal with 
the Coyotes nipping at their heels as 
their offense put them out in front 
by large margins early on. In the 
first game of the doubleheader on 

Feb. 22, UCSD scored five runs each 
in the second and third innings and 
that was all the Tritons needed as 
they cruised to a 10-5 win. 

Once again, UCSD got a shaky 
performance from a starting pitch-
er, but this time, the bullpen lived 
up to its early season expectations 
and kept the Coyotes from claw-
ing their way back into the game. 
Sophomore right-hander Kirby St. 
John took the mound to replace 
freshman starter Guido Knudson 
and turned in a brilliant perfor-
mance to earn the win, pitching 3.2 
innings of scoreless work in which 
he struck out eight Coyotes.

In the opener on Feb. 21, UCSD 
again used a big inning to cruise 
to victory. This time it came in the 
seventh, when the Tritons, lead-
ing 6-5, put together a seven-run 
inning to jump out to a 13-5 lead 
they would not relinquish.

Two Wins Can Clinch Home Playoff  Game

MEN’S BASKETBALL — Despite 
back-to-back losses on the road and 
a season-high three straight losses, 
UCSD remained in the upper-ech-
elon of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association with hopes of 
hosting a first-round playoff game. 
The Tritons fell by a 70-55 final 
score to conference leader and 20th-
ranked Cal State San Bernardino on 
Feb. 22 and dropped a close 78-76 
decision to Cal Poly Pomona on 
Feb. 23. UCSD now holds a 15-9 
record overall and 11-7 league mark 
with two games left in the regular 
season.

Despite shooting only 35 percent 
in the first half, UCSD was able 
to build an early lead against the 
Broncos and stay in front for most 
of the period. Cal Poly Pomona 
responded, connecting on a blis-
tering 63.2 percent of their first-
half field goals. The Broncos built a 
slight six-point lead at the half, with 
three of their four three-pointers 
before the break coming on con-
secutive possessions with less than 
four minutes to play. 

The Tritons would trail by 11 
just 4:11 into the second half, but 
junior forward Darryl Lawlor and 
junior guard Alan Husted connect-
ed on three-pointers to keep the 
game close. Though unable to tie 
the game, UCSD trailed by no more 
than seven down the stretch. Down 
six in the final minute, senior guard 
Clint Allard converted a rare four-
point play to keep the Triton come-

back hopes alive.
“In that situation we just needed 

to score as quickly as possible, pref-
erably a three, and I took the shot 
when I had some room, held my fol-
low through, and was lucky enough 
to have the defender run into me 
after the release,” Allard said.

Following two Bronco free throws, 
Allard connected again from behind 
the arc to make it a one-point game 
with 7.8 seconds remaining. UCSD 
was able to quickly foul and put the 
Broncos’ Angelo Tsagarakis on the 
line. Tsagarakis converted only one-
of-two and Husted hit Allard with 
an outlet pass. Unfortunately, the 
Triton magic ended there as Allard’s 
final field goal attempt was blocked, 
and Cal Poly Pomona escaped with 
the two-point home win.

“In hindsight, I should have 
made a different decision in the sit-
uation,” said Allard, who led UCSD 
with a game-high 22 points while 
adding six rebounds and two assists. 
“Hopefully, I will make a better 
decision if we get that shot again. 
I still like the ball in my hands [in 
pressure situations].”

UCSD converted 47.2 percent 
of its field goal attempts and 52.2 
percent of its three-point attempts 
but allowed a 62.2-percent shooting 
performance from the Broncos. Cal 
Poly Pomona also out-rebounded 
the Tritons, 30-27, and recorded five 
blocked shots in the game. Lawlor 
and senior guard Andrew Hatch 
joined Allard in double-digit scor-
ing with 16 and 12 points, respec-
tively. Lawlor added a game-high 
seven rebounds, while Hatch and 

junior guard Kelvin Kim tied for the 
team-lead with three assists each.

UCSD and CCAA leader Cal State 
San Bernardino experienced five 
lead changes early in their matchup 
the night before. The Coyotes were 
able to distance themselves midway 
through the half, holding the Tritons 
scoreless for over three minutes and 
extending their lead to seven points. 
Sophomore guard Jordan Lawley 
started a 9-2 UCSD run that tied 
the game at 23 with a three-pointer 
of his own and an assist on the first 
of two consecutive Allard threes. 
The Coyotes responded with their 
own short run and were able to 
take a six-point lead at the half. 
Unfortunately, the Tritons would get 
no closer than two possessions in 
the second half with CSUSB holding 
a double-digit advantage most of the 
period en route to the final 15 point 
advantage.

“[The Coyotes] are a very good 
team that can beat you with a lot 
of different guys both inside and 
outside,” said Allard, who again led 
UCSD by scoring with 13 points. 
“They did whatever they wanted to 
offensively and we didn’t put up 
much resistance.”

Lawley added 11 points and a 
team-high four assists, while Kim 
scored 10 points and tied the team-
high with three rebounds. The Tritons 
shot 47.2 percent from the field, but 
again allowed their opponents greater 
offensive efficiency, as the Coyotes 
connected on 26-of-44 from the field 
and 9-of-18 from three-point range.

Tritons Have Tough 
Time at Irvine Tourney
By Janani Sridharan

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — The 
No. 16 UCSD women’s water polo 
team ended a tough UC Irvine 
tournament last weekend on a high 
note, winning its last game after 
losing the first three contests of the 
tournament against ranked oppo-
nents. The Tritons suffered losses 
to No. 2 Stanford University and 
No. 10 UC Irvine on Feb. 23 before 
splitting their games the follow-
ing day. UCSD lost in overtime 
to No. 15 University of Michigan 
before finishing the tournament 
with a victory over No. 13 UC Santa 
Barbara. 

After suffering three losses, the 
Tritons’ lone victory in the tour-
nament did not come easily. The 
Tritons were able to overcome late 
goals from the Gauchos to win the 
game by a close score of 8-7. 

UCSD started out the game 

strong, outscoring the Gauchos 4-
2 in the first half. The Gauchos 
showed more life in the third quar-
ter, scoring two goals to match 
UCSD’s two scores in the quarter. 
With the Tritons leading 6-4, UCSB 
scored a quick goal at the start 
of the fourth quarter to cut the 
Tritons’ lead to one. 

The Tritons answered the 
Gauchos’ threat with their own two 
goals to give UCSD a seemingly safe 
lead of 8-5 with 3:41 left in regula-
tion. The Gauchos weren’t content 
with exiting quietly as they scored 
two more goals to pull within one. 
However, UCSB’s late goals would 
prove to be too little too late as 
the Tritons held off the Gauchos to 
earn the 8-7 victory.

Sophomore attacker Audra 
Bloom led the scoring for the 
Tritons in the game with three goals 
and senior goalkeeper Kim Hockett
