Adm'n,Students Clash.Over Coffee Hut 
By Kathy Huffer 

. Associate News Editor 
While student efforts to . 

prevent conversion of the 
Coffee Hut into a faculty club 
a re gaining momentum , 
administration officials are 
now investigating ways to 
finanoe such a conversion. 

'!Vi II it SeeD me a Faeu Ity CI u b? '·Fifty-Fifty Ch ance' 
providing ongoing services to 
students in addition to 
instruction, according to the 
manual. 

Assistant Chancellor David 
Ryer , chairman of the faculty 
c lub committee which i 
conducting the investigation, 
says there is "only about-a fifty-
fifty chance" that the Coffee 
Hut will be 'replaced by a / 
faculty club. 

The " biggest hurdle" a nd the 
" most single critical" criteria 
for establishing the club, 
according to Ryer, is finding an 
outside operator to take charge 
of the faculty club. 

Yet while Ryer said that the 
conversion of the Coffee Hut is 
still uncertain, a letter written 
by Chancellor William 
McElroy indicates otherwise. 

The March 19 memo, sent to the 
Coffee Hut and the Associated 
Students, states that " we have 
decided to convert it (the Coffee 
Hut) to the much-needed 
faculty club." 

Ryer said that McElroy 
actually meant that a decision 
had been made to try to convert 
the Coffee Hut into a faculty 
club. 

McElroy first a nnounced his 
intention of pursuing the 
conversion in January. Since 
that time, student opposition to 
the idea has strengthened. 

The AS has taken a strong 
stand against the conversion of 
the Coffee Hut into a faculty 
club. Claiming that student 
monies were used-for much of 
the facility's original con-
struction costs, the AS says it 

should be responsible for 
determining the Coffee Hut's 
future . 

, ·It 's really hard to figure 
out" who should claim financial 
responsibility for the Coffee 
Hut's. original construction, 
remarked Ryer. " Intelligent 
people could argue either 
way .. . so all you can do is to look 
at the file ," he added. 

According to financial data 
compiled by Vice Chancellor of 
Budget Affairs Herman 
Johnson, a total of $38,850 was 
invested in the Coffee Hut from 
its original construction in 1966 
to March of 1971. 

During this time, the funding 
had been appropriated by the 
AS, which was dissolved in 1972. 

A breakdown of the figure 
shows that $10,000 was paid 

- ....:.-....;.~ -

with :-egistration fees; 25,850 
came from " Incidental Fees"; 
the AS contributed $2,000; and 
vending ma chine revenues 
accounted for $1.000. 

(The AS contribution figure 
has not been confirmed, 
according. to Johnson's data .) 

Nearly all of these sources of 
money, according to university 
definition, were funds used for 
student purposes. 

The Campus Planning and 
Budget Manual specifies that 
"t he use of University · 
Registration Fee income be 
limited to support of Student 
Services and facilities ." The 
Incidental Fee, forerunner to 
the Reg Fee, was also ' 
esta blished by the Regents in 
1921 for the purpose of meeting 
a projected budget deficit and 

Although Ryer agrees that 
most of the initial Coffee Hut 
investments originated from 
student-oriented fees , " the fact 
that you've invested in a 
building does not make that 

your property." 'The Coctee}/ijrt 
" belongs to the umvenmy, fie 
said. 

The AS, in the 1978 UCSD 
Space Allocation books, is 
listed as the " department" 
under which heading the CoHee 
Hut falls . 

Marc Stolman, a Reg Fee 
intern who is currently 
investigating student space 
allocation on campus, in-
terpreted this to mean that the 
CoHee Hut "is .currently tbe 
AS's." Stolman said that "they 
don ' t have a legal title to it, but 
that's who has jurisdiction."

'University of California, San Diego 

Volume 37, Number 3 

The UC Board of Regents. recently approved the plans and schematic design for a 50o-seat 
theatre at UCSD, according to Vice Chancellor of Facilities Management Don Siles, 

The $2,5 million theatre is a gift to the University from the Theatre and Arts Foundation of San 
Diego County, said Sites. 

The theatre 'will be located south of the Humanities Library in a grove of trees near La Jolla 
Village Drive,_ and construction will begin by Dec., 1979, said Sites. 

According to Sites, the University w,lI have access to the theatre during the-nine month school 
year, while the theatre will be usecf exclusively by the Foundation during the three summer 
months. 

Tbe Foundation and the Regents have agreed that the theatre will be used to benefit 
underprivileged children during the summer. 

A board of select members affiliated with the University will decide on a name for the theatre 
and final approval will come from the Regents. 

Revelle Post Still Empty, 
~inal Trio Identified, But SaJtman Worries On 

By John Hondros 
A •• odale News Editor 

Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Saltman has once 
again delayed selecting the 
new Revelle College Provost 
because he doesn't want to 
enrage the Regents" -by 
deciding on "the wrong 
candidate. " 

"Making an appointment like 
this demands the cor,telation of 
a lot of people, " remarked 
Sallman, "and an agreement 
has to be made before offering 
the job." 

The three finalists for 
Revelle Provost recommended 
to Saltman by the select Search 
Committee are: Stanley 
Chodorow. USCD professor of 
History; Karl Lamb, acting 
provost at Cowell College. UC 
Santa Cruz; and Chia-Wei Woo, 
Northwestern University 
chairperson of physics. I 

Saltman said he wUl not rush 
into making the decision, as he 
wants to avoid "getting 
(himselO, the Regents and the 
candidate In an embarassing 
situation.' , 

Saltman had no comment as 
to when the new Provost will be 
announced. 

Third College Provost Joseph 
Watson. a member of the 
Search Committee. said earlier 
this week that the Committee 
" reel (s) very comfortable" 
with their candidate recom-
mendations. 

Chodorow, one of the 
candidates for Provost, has 
been with UCSD's History 
Department since 1968. 
Chodorow attended Cornell

AS Ven~ing 
Boycott (Finally) 
Begins Monday 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

The stogan " Don 't feed Big 
Mac - he's full of it already" 
will greet students heading for 
the vending machines next 
week if the AS is successful in 
carrying through with plans for 
their vending machine boycott, 
delayed from last quarter. 

Part of a larger effort, the 
slogan would be printed on a 
sil houette of Chancellor 
William McElroy and placed 
over each vending coin slot, 
with the slot in place of the 
mouth on the silhouette, Nancy 
Laga, leader of the Vending 
Machine Task Force, said , 
yesterday. 

Laga also said the task force 
is hoping to capitalize on the 
slogan " Don' t Take Candy 
From Strangers" in the boycott 
effort. 

Laga told the AS Council 
Wednesday night she also plans 
an extensive poster campaign 
on each of the four campuses, 
as well as a "media blitz" (the 
specifics of which have not been 
decided) and a Wednesday 
noon rally on Revelle Plaza. 
There will also be a full page ad 
in The Guardian explaining the 
boycott and exhorting students 
to suppOrt it, Laga said. 

The boycott was sparked by 
McElroy's summer decision to 
transfer vending revenues 
from the colleges to Housing 
and Food Services in order to 
make up the debt in HFS. 
Supporters of the boycott argue 
the switch will cripple the 
spending flexibility of college 
governments, and criticize 
McElroy for not consulting 

• ~!~-:~t8.~ef~~:~_~~?le . . 

Besides the boycott, Laga 
said the AS is beginning to 
contact ARA (the current 
vending contractor) and other 
vending companies about 
replacing the administration 
contract with one worked 
through through the AS. Laga 
says any contract would 
probably be made by the 
Student Center Board, which 
has contracted with outside 
companies before. 

The success of the boycott 
will depend on students, Laga 
said. " It 's important that 
students show they care about 
this issue .. .it's going to be 
almost impossible to -make the 
administration do what we 
want to do." 

The administration had 
agreed to a compromise 
proposal with AS President 
John J enkel that would have 
split the yending fe~~ between

TestingCompariy 
Clout Inspected · 
Scores Hold Key to Good Life; 
May be Abused, Lack Validity 

By Steven Levy 
Pacific News Service 

S tandardized testing is now so pervasive throughout American liCe that the Educational Testing Service (ETS) can proudly describe itself as "the world's gate-
keeper." Three hours with a number two pencil and an ETS test 
can determine whether a person will be admitted to the good 
life, or locked out. 

In their "Infant Laboratory" on the 400 acre ETS "campus" 
in Lawrence, New Jersey, ETS researchers study the learning 
processes oC babies as young as three months. They prepare 
"basic skills" tests that require school children to show a 
command of certain subjects before advancing to the next 
grade. They provide an admissions test for children wishing to 
go to the better secondary private schools. 

Amost all those who have college hopes must take the ETS 
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Graduates conCront the 
company's questionnaires as they seek entry into law school, 
business school, and just plain graduate school. And job hunters 
must cope with tests that claim to measure ability or knowledge 
In teaching, x-ray technology, auto mechaniCS, or any of over 50 
other job categories ranging from golf shop pro to CIA agent. 
Even after years of work, one may be asked to take a "self-
marked" test in a specific area of his or her particular field. 

C learly, this non-profit organization, which grossed almost $80 million last year, has clout. "Forget about 
where ETS would stand on the Fortune 500," says Alan 

Nairn, who has been studying ETS with Ralph Nader for four 
years. "As Car as influence and pewer over the comsumer is 
concerned, ETS is in a class with General Motors and AT&T. 
What's frightening is that, unlike those other companies, ETS is 
virtually unregulated, .. 

ETS escapes many forms of government regulation by virtue 
of its non-profit status. Attempts to pass "Truth in Testing" 
bills in CoDiress have been stalled or lobbied to death by ETS, 
which also lobbied to exempt itself from the Buckley" Pri vacy" 
Amendment. 

To every complaint about its unchecked power over the 
millions who must take the tests every year, ETS responds: 
"Trust Us." 
. Most test-takers, including the million-and-a-half 
prospective collegians who took SAT last year, have no choice. 

Yet evidence is now mounting that ETS test scores may be 
both invalid and misused. The scores, which are not meant to be 
preCise, are precisely applied by schools and employers. And 
the tests themselves may meuure a person's skill in takiq 
tests more than they do any other abiUty. 

Acknowledgina the problem, ETS consistently warns those 
insitutions aDd employers who receive tesl scores that the 
exams are limited in validity and atcuracy, and sbC!Uld not be 
given too much weight in decisions of admissions or hiriDi. 

F orexalnple, a standard "error of measurement" (EM) built into the tests belies the seemingly precise form in 
which the score is reported. The SAT is seared in three-

digit numbers ranging from 200 to 800, but has a 32-point EM, 
meaning that a ~point difference between the scores of two 
students is practically insignificant. Despite this, those who 
evaluate scores frequently make decisions on as little as five-
point differences. 

"I know it's not Cair, but that's the way we do it," says one 
admissions director at an Eastern school. "We have to use 
something to narrow our choices." 

Even more harsh is the practice oC many institutions of 
setting "cutoCr' points, below which they will not consider 
applicants. This gives a "do-or-die" quality to the tests that 
even ETS has gone on record as deploring .. 'This is a weak point 
in the process," admits ETS director oftechnical development 
William Angofr. 

The problem of misuse of test scores is compounded by 
evidence indicating that the scores can be artificially raised by 
short or intermediate "coaching." This problem goes to the 
very heart oC ETS, which insists that the tests measure 
"developed ability" acquired over many years, and are not 
susceptible to coaching. 

Yet a study conducted at the U.S. Military Academy in the 
mid-Sixties showed that intensive preparation raised score~ an 
average of 57 points on the verbal portion oC SAT, and 79 points 
on the math section, for an overall average of 136 points, enoulh 
to rna ke a difference to almost any college admissions director. 

A more recent study by one of ETS' own researchers, Lewis 
Pike, also concluded that scores on the SAT-math test could be 
silDificantJy improved by a short-term program of instruction. 
Pike was subsequently "terminated."

Huey Newton Trial Has Drama of TV 
Revelations, Contradictions 
Evoke Perry Mason Episode 

Huey Newton was once the epitome of everything the White establishment fears . 
most. In the last sixties. when Newton and his Oakland·based Black Panther Party 
toted guns on the ghetto streets of their home town and even on one occasion in the 
Capitol Building in Socramento, FBI Director J . Edgar Hoover called the Panthers 
"the greatest threat to the internal security of our country." 

Today , however, with the fearful sPecter of "Black Rage" forgotten by mast 
Whites, Newton and the Panthers receive lillie attention. The Panthers, their 
numbers greatly reduced, are still active, running a respected Oakland community 
school. And unlike Eldridge 'Cleaver and &bby Seale. two of his well known fellow 
Panthers, Newton has stayed with the party. ' 

Newton is currently awaiting a second triol on charges that he murdered an 
Oakland prostitute in 1974. While proclaiming his innocence, Newton at first said he 
could never get a fair trial and escaped prosecution by fleeing to Cuba. He returned 
to the US in 1977. ready to fight the allegations which he said were part of on FBI 
attempt to discredit the party. 

His first trial ended in a hung jury last week and the prosecution is planning a 
retrial. Trapper Byrne. sometime contributor to Tit. G .. ardia., covered the trial 
for the D.iIy Cali/or ••• and wrote this account of the proceedings reprinted by 
permission which proved. according to Newton. t hot a Black man can stili not expect 
justice in America, 

By Trapper Byrne 

The murder trial oC Black 
Panther Party leader Huey 
Newton, which ended with a 
hung jury Saturday , had all the 
makings of what Newton's 
defense attorney told jurors the 
trial would not be - a Perry 
Mason episode. 

Newton's lawyer, Michael 
Kennedy , warned prospective 
jurors during jury selection 
that "trials can sometimes get 
boring," and that the defense's 
case would not rely on 
"sOocking. revelations like you 
see on Perry Mason." 

But the three-week-Iong trial 
had moments Raymond Burr 
would have been proud. 

There was the prosecution 
witness, Michelle Jenkins, a 
prostitute turned armored 
truck company 1!mployee, who 
testified she saw Newton argue 
with, and then shoot, 17-year-
old prostitute Kathleen Smith 
the early morning of August 6, 
1974, She took the stand a week 
and a half later, dramatically 
announcing to the court that she 
had lied during her earlier 
testimony, 

" I never did want to get 

involved in this," Jenkins told 
prosecutor Thomas Orloff 
under cross-examination. • 'I 
was more or less, to be blunt, 
tricked into it. I can't say Huey 
Newton shot that girl. 
Everyone, the police, every-
body's trying to make me think 
I saw something when I didn ' t," 
she said. " I really don 't know 
who shot her ... 

There was the prosecution's 
strongest witness, 25-year-old 
Charles Lee Buie, who was 
acompanied Lo the courtroom 
in the proteetive custody of an 
armed contingent of United 
States marshals. 

Buie, who called himself a 
"street hustler," told the court 
in a subdued, emotionless voice 
that he watched Crom a few feet 
away as Newton walked up to 
Smith and, as his bodyguard 
waved a pistol and yelled 
" don't anybody fuck around," 
shot her once in the face. 

" She just fell. She just fell ," 
Buie repeated. " She fell in slow 
motion. It took her about 10 
seconds to hit the ground. I saw 
her Call about 20 seconds in my 
mind," he said quietly. 

It did not take defense 
attorney Kennedy long to 
dispute Buie's credibility as he 
admitted under cross-
eXaminiation that he had been 
smoking marijuana for three 
hours before the shooting. In 
Kennedy's opening statement, 
he told the same jurors whom 
he had cautioned against 
expecting "shocking revela-

lions" that it was actually Buie, 
not N ewton, who murdered 
Smith. 

Calling Buie's reputation for 
honesty " terrible," Kennedy 
summoned Klemens Kopen, 
who lived in the same 
apartment complex that Buie 
did for almost two years, to 
testify. Kopen called Buie "a 
liar, a thief. a scoundrel, a con 
man," and "the lowest form of 
life." 

In an effort to support his 
claim that Buie committed the 
Smith murder, Kennedy also 
called Larry Henson, one of 
Newton's bodyguards, to the 
stand . Henson testified that he 
and fellow bodyguard Robert 
Heard were giving Buie a ride 
home in the P anthers' leased 
car when Buie got out of the 
automobile on the corner of 29th ' 
Street and San Pablo Avenue in 
Oakland and shot Smith . 

Orloff, who throughout the 
trial tried to show that the 
defense's accusation of Buie 
was a contrived strategy, did 
more damage to .the confused 
Henson's testimony than to that 
of any of the other witnesses. 
Henson first said he had only 
met Kennedy recently to 
discuss testifying, and later 
under cross-examination 
admitted he and Kennedy had 
eaten lunch together several 
times since last June. 

Newton raised OrloCrs ire 
once, when he tried to tell 
jurors why two of the 
prosecu tion ' s su pposed 

eyewitnesses , Jeanette lies and 
Raphaelle Gary, were not 
c ailed to testify . 

Orloff and Kennedy each 
claim they were t.he first to 
discover that nes was 'in jail on 
prostitution charges the night 
of the Smith murder, and, 
although Orloff will not confirm 
it, Kennedy claimed that Gary 
did not testify because Orloff 
did not want her questioned 
about her conCession to another

NEWS BRIEFS 
From The Associated Press 

NATIONAL 
Carter: Less_ Oil at Higher Prices 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Carter told 

the American people last night "each one of you 
will have to use less oil and pay more Cor it" ashe 
announced plans to gradually lift ceilings on 
U S produced crude oil by 1981. 

In his text for a television·radio address from 
the Oval Office. Carter said he is asking 
Congress to impose a " windfall profits tax" that 

would sop up half the extra revenues that oil 
companies would get from higher prices under 
decontrol or from price increases dictated by 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. 

Although Carter may legally lift controls 
without congressional approval. the House and 
Senate must approve the tax . 

Three Mile Will be Investigated 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Carter said 

last night he will appoint an independent 
commission of experts to investigate what went 
wrong at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. 

"You deserve a full accounting. and you will 
get it ." Carter said in his energy speech to the 
nation. 

But administration officials made it clear that 

Carter will not make any immediate move to 
shut down the nation 's 72 nuclear generators. 
which supply about 13 percent of the nation's 
electrical power. 

And they said he will continue to push 
Congress to enact legislation to cut down the 
length of time needed to license a new nuclear 
generating station .

The critics said the plant 's owners may have 
been able to save between $37 million and $48

began commercia l operations at the phmt on 
Dec. 30 of that year.

Drive Offers 
Blood Insurance 

By Steve Morus 
Senior Siaff Wriu'r 

Do you know how much ' it 
would cost if you or a member 
of your famil y needed six pints 
of blood as the result of a n 
injury or operation? At the 
current rate of $43 a pint 
charged by the San Diego Blood 
Bank it would cost you $258. 

CSD's semi-annual blood 
drive provides a mea ns of doing 
so m et hing about that. 
Scheduled for next Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday . the 
blood drive takes 40 minutes of 
your time and one pint of blood. 
In return . UCSD 's blood 
account at the blood bank 
provides low cost blood to 
UC SD tudent , staff and 
faculty. and their immedia te 
families. 

The account work& by paying 
the $13 repl ace ment fee 
required by the blood bank. 
which is rarely covered by 
health insur a n ce pl a n s. 
according to Ann Rossi. Blood

AS, CalPIRG 
, 

Will Hold Rally 
on Atomic Power 

By Bob Slaymaker 
and Doug Campion 

The AS and CalPIRG, spurred on by public concern at last 
week's Three Mile Island nuclear disaster, have organized a 
student rally today at noon calling for a halt in the construction of 
two two nuclear reactors in San Onofre which are situated 60 miles 
north of UCSD. 

The rally at the gym steps is designed to inform stud'ents of the 
actions they can take in order to prevent further nuclear accidents -
from occurring, according to David Harris, organizer of CalPIRG 
at·UCSD. 

As Lobby Annex Director Linda Sabo added that the rally may 
deal with the use of nuclear technology in the production of 
weapons in addition to touching on the problems involved with 
nuclear power. 

Sabo said that AS Commissioner of Student Welfare Barry 
Hyman, one of the scheduled speakers, will discuss "nuclear 
weapons and the media ." Sabo is also scheduled to speak. 

The featured speaker, according to Harris, will be Karen 
Orsulak of the Community Energy Action Network (CEAN) . 
Orsulak, a UCSD alumna, will give " an overview of the safety 
problems involved with nuclear power and (will discuss) 
alternatives to nuclear power," said Harris. 

Harris ·cited attendance at a larger rally tomorrow in Balboa 
Park and participation in a demonstration at San Onofre in two 
weeks as two forms of action students will take to further their 
cause. 

The source of this most recent furor is the failure and subsequent 
leakage of radiation by the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant in 
Harrisburg, Pennsvlvania last week. 

Low levels of radiation could be detected in the atmosphere 20 
miles away, necessitating limited evacuation of the surrounding 
communities. 

Despite the fact that the design of the San Onofre plant is 
different from that at Three Mile Island, Harris expressed that 
people residing in this area should not be any less concerned. He 
noted that " the human factor" is present in any instance. 

CalPIRG contends that if an evacuation of the nearby 
communities in San Onofre were necessary due to a radiation leak 
from one of the reactors, it could not be successfully carried out 
due to the lack of necessary preparation. 

Tbe health of those unable to be evacuated, reports CalPIRG, 
would thus be threatened. 

In a recent CalPIRG report, Dr. Henry Kendall , a member of the 
Union of Concerned Scientists, states that evacuation of areas 
downwind from a nuclear reactor should extend to 40 miles. This 
4O-mile figure is based on findings which show that the short-term 
acute effects of radiation exposure can lead. to lethal injury for 
people living within 20 miles of a reactor. 

Captain Melvin Nichols of the San Diego County Sheriff's 
department, who would shoulder the responsibility for executing 
an evacuation of the San Onofre Beach area, says that mass 
evacuation would be nearly impoSSible. 

The lack of force so often characteristic in the effort to organize 
a student movement of this sort, according toHarris, is essentially 
the result of the assumption on the part of many people that 
working against the large power companies is futile. He noted

Tonight the shores of Mission 
Bay will be strewn with 
hundreds of thousands of 
dollars worth of rowing 
equipment as schools from 
throughout the nation beach 
their boats after taking the 
traditional practice run before

"The Classic has direct \

Vallerga. "If we're going to

Cyclists Take Second in 
Claremont Criterium 

The UCSD bicycle team sped 
to a second place finish at a 
Claremont College Criterium 
tournament last weekend , 
finishing with 69 points, just 
behind UC Santa Barbara 's 
winning total of 74. 

The events opened with a 
three lap team trial (2.5 miles) 
in which each team entered 
four riders. Teams rode alone 
on the circuit, pacing 
themselves in order to 
maintain the highest possible 
speed for the short distance. 
UCSB won the event with a time 
of 5: 19.62, earning 15 points. 
The Tritons ' were third with 
5: 40.23. 

A 24 lap (18.5 mile) novice 
race for men was totally 
controlled by UCSD. Kurt Sato 
took the first and third sprints 
for points ' (awarded every 6 
laps - 3, 2, and 1 points) . He 

suffered a punctured rear tire 
one lap bef<We the second 
sprint, so teammate Jeff 
Borders took that sprint, just 
holding off Santa Barbara's 
Ken Rock at the line. 

Sato received a quick wheel 
change, re-entered the race 
and copped the third points 
sprint (rom Cal Poly Pomona's 
Mike Fuller, with Borders 
picking up a single point for 
third place. 

The end of the race started 
with a lap to go as Sato powered 
off the front to win by a 
comfortable margin. Borders 
again held off Rock, this time 
for a second place overall 
Hnish. Eric Zentner took eighth 
place for the Tritons. 

The women's event was a 2-
up contest (rom the gun as 
UCSD's Susan VanGundy won 
2 of 3 points sprints and the race 

with a quick move past 
Williams with one half mile to 
go, finishing with a 30 meter 
edge. 

UCSD went into the final 
event, a 40 lap (30 mile) 
criterium (or expert class 
riders, leading in the team 
points classification. It soon 
became apparent that the lead 
was not to last long as the race 
turned into a Rory O 'Reilly 
Classic. O'Reilly, a UCSB rider 
holdi.!1g national records as well 
as countless race wins, 
dominated the event, winning 
all five points sprints and the 
race by impressive margins. 

The only bright spots for 
UCSD were a second place 
finish in one point sprint by 
Steve Smull, earning a third 
place overall finish .. Alan 
McReynold finished in eighth 
position for the Tritons.

Another UCSD intercol -
legiate team may soon be on its 
way to national competition. 
The men's volleyball team has 
a chance to go to the NAIA 
national volleyball champion-
ships on April 28, but first the 
team has to prove to Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet that they 
are the best NAJA team on the 
West Coast. 

To do this , the netters must 
win in an upcoming contest 
against Cal Lutheran. Luther-
an and LaVerne are the only 
two NAJA teams on the West 
Coast with men's vollyeball 
programs within reasonable 
traveling distance of UCSD. 
The Tritons have defeated 
LaVerne twice this season and 
lost to Cal Lutheran at the 
opponent 's court in mid-March. 
The two teams are scheduled 
for the important rematch in 
the Main Gym on April 18 at 
7: 30 pm. 

Although the Tritons have 
already received an invitation 
to the Richmond , Indiana 
tournament, they still have to 
" show Judy Sweet and the 
athletic department that we 
deserve the chance to play in 
the nationals," according to 
Triton coach Doug Dannevik. 

The Cal Lutheran rematch is 
not the only important hurdle 
the volleyball team must 
overcome in their quest for a 
trip to IndIana. A strong league 
showing is a must. With one 
league game remaining 
against UC Riverside Dannevik 
is hoping for a second place 
finish. The team currently 
possesses a 4-2 league record, 
behind first place CSU 
Northridge. 

UCSD is the site for the 
upcoming league tournament 
in which all the teams from the 
league will participate in round 
robin competition. Dannevik 
also sees a second place finish 
in this tournament as being a 
realistic goal for the team. 

Planning and recruiting for 
next year's team are already 
underway. The Tritons hosted a 
tournament Cor ten area high 
school teams, bringing many 
prospective players to the 
campus. Dannevik feels that 
the chance to see the UCSD 
campus, gym and meet the 
Triton players, who officiated 
the matches, are Important -
steps In the recruiting process. 

A few high school players 
have already expressed an 
Interest in playing on the team 
for the 79-80 season. One 
"definite" player already 
accepted at UCSD is Kearny 
High School's Dan Rosenthal.

Softball Women Stifled 
Coach Notes Improvement, Chapman Unimpressed 

By Clady Biondi

the team can hit of( of a strong 
opposing pitcher they will have 
their game under control. 

Over Spring Break 

The team takes on Cal 
Baptist in an away game this 
afternoon at 3 pm. The Triton Women's Softball 

team sbowed ., noticeable 
Improvement" ina losing effort 
to undefeated Chapman 
College here Tuesday. UCSD's 
orfensive efforts were stifled by 
a a-o no-hitter. 

Starting Triton pitcber Jill 
Keene ,ave up the three runs in 
the lirst two iDD.ings, then 
buckled down to keep the tough 
Chapman team from scering 
the rest of the ,arne. Keene's 
controlled pitching as well as 
good backup from the outfield 
make for a good defensive 
game, according to coach John 
Elliot. 

UCSD Golfers Not 
Up to Competition 

Elliot feels the team is 
"Swinging the bat fine and will 
have it under control in a few 
lames." He added that the 
team still needs work on 
placing their hits in the right 
places. 

"The team was much more 
relaxed and there was a good 
deal of improvement in all of 
our players." 

With a Cull schedule of two 
,ames a week throUilhout 
April, EllIot expects improve-
ment with each game. The 

. TritoD's overall record stands 
at no wins and two 10000s. 

"Eighty percent of the games 
is in the pitching," according to 
Elliot. The coach feel~ that once

The Triton golfers managed 
to survive their heaviest 
competition of the year against 
some of the top teams in the 
nation in three major 
tournaments over spring 
break. 

Coming oritwo solid victories 
the last week of school, the 
Tritons had their work cut out 
for them in the Southern Cal 
Tourney at Torrey Pines. 

Jim Miller led the host team 
with rounds of 80 and 77 for a 
two day total of 157. 

"We ran into problems when 
two of OUr players could not 
compete, definitely putting us 
well back in the field ," 
according to Coach Joe Owens. 
Nationally ranked UCLA won 
the tournament. 

Next up was the All-Cal 
Tourney. Harris Frankel 
returned to old form in stroking 
to a 78 receiving strong support

UCSD managed a fifth place 
showing. finishing behind 
UCLA. Davis, Santa Uarbara 
and Berkeley. 

"We did all right considering 
we were again caught a man 
short." said Owens . 

Held at the tight Huntington 
Sea Cliffs course the tourna-
ment had to be called after one 
round due to rain. 

Finally it was off to the 
Ixtapa Golf Resort, about 125 
miles north of Acapulco, for a 
few good rounds and an eighth 
place finish . 

The lone representative from 
California, UCSD was pitted 
against the powerhouse schools 
of Texas and Missouri, eleven 
schools total. 

Warnick again played strong 
- in leading the Triton effort 
firing to a three day total of 243, 
with a low round of 77. 

The UCSD women's soHball learn was a victim of a 3-0 no-hit 
shutout against Chapman. Tracy Weiscnh eimer, above, the Triton

'Beatlemania' Captures Essence of 60's 
S an Diego's highes t decibel reading was 

nol detected at Lind-
bergh Field: it occurred at 
Balboa Park . Nordid the sound 
consist of a roaring jet: it was 
that of a screaming crowd. The 
year was 1964 and the event an 
appearance by the Beatles. 
Fifteen years later, that record 
will undoubtedly be broken 
with the arrival of Beatie-
mania, a multimedia program 
which visually and audibly 
captures the essence that is the 
sixties. 

The songs are equally as 
appealing. Sound designer Abe 
Jacob and music adaptor 
Andrew Dorfman have kept 
extremely faithful to the 
original background music of 
the compositions, witH a few 
minor variations in terms of 
note . arrangement and 

instrument u sage. The 
selections are performed on the 
loud side, as the program is 
definitely not for those with 
sensitive eardrums . For-
tunately , a n intermission 
between the tow one-hour acts 
of Beatlemania allows the 
viewer's ears to recover. In 

addition , the program is 
spri nkled with non-musical 
moments such as interaction 
between the group and the 
audience and amongst the 
members themselves. 

RaJph Castelli. On the stage, 
the four assume their BritiBb 
counterpans as the cast of 
Beademaaia_ Although DOt 
chosen on the basis of physical 
characteristics , vocal simi-
larities, or ancestral back-
grounds, these are more than 
compensated for by wardrobe 
supervisor Ann Kelleher , 
hairdresser Bud Russel aDd 
speech consultant Carla 
Meyer. Leon is the most 
convicing in all three areas_ It 
would not be at all difficult to 
confuse bim with John Lennon. 
His version of .. A Day in the 
Life" is realistically executed 
down to the mannerisms aDd 
movements. Curatolo hasn'! 
the pretty boy looks of PauJ 
McCanney. but his tbroaty 
tenor is a close rival, especially 
when he sings "Yesterday" and 
" The Long and Winding Road. " 
While Laufer's vocals are 
restricted to back-ups for 
Lennon and McCartney , he is a 
lookalike in bis appearance and 
musicianship of George 
Harri on. Castelli 's reoditionof 
" With a LitUe Help From My 
Friends" has a IighU)" tiony 
and na al quality. Howe\'er. it, 
along with hi d rum playing. 
are by no mean unpleasant to 
the ears. 

From March 29 to April 29, 
Fox Theater audiences will be 
treated to a two hour history 
lesson. The program places the 
decade and the group on a 
direct correspondence, 
resulting in a growth chart of 
both entities told in nine 
separate scenes. The produc--
tion is not a slick impersonation 
of the Beatles , nor is ita glittery 
tribute to the sixties. Rather, 
Beatlemania is an evolution of 
an era, recorded by candid 
visuals and typified by prolific 
music. 

I 

p? 
I 

In everyday life, they are 
known as David Leon, Joe 
Curatolo, Robert Laufer and 

The montage of film clips, 
slides, and optical effects seen 
in Beatlemania is well 
organized and creatively put 
together, for which Robert and 
Kathleen Rabinowitz , Bob Gill, 
Shep Kerman, a nd Lynda Obst 
can be commended. There a re 
instances in which it is 
somewhat out of step with the 
music. However, they occur 
infrequently and the delay is 
miniscule s uch that only an 
individual highly experienced 
or familiar in theerea of editing 
would notice or even dwell upon 
these deviations. 

"The Long and Winding Road" takes another delOur, lhi time to San Diego'sFox Theatre for a 
month. 

Perhaps the ingle na", of 
Bealleman ia with the 
exception of the loudness) is in 
the tendency of \ 1 ual Charles 
E. Hoffler to barrage the 
audience itb the procram' 
vi ual pre entation. Eye train 
and fru tration are tbe 
inevitable re ull of the 
viewer's attempt to the

'Spirit Catcher' Part of Betye Saar Exhibit 
"B etye Saar is a Significant 

artist who just happens to be a 
black woman," said Gerry 

McAllister, director of the Mandeville 
Art Gallery, which will exhibit the 
works of the talented Californian of 
critical acclaim, April 5 through May 
13. 

Broken toys, bones, teeth, lace, 
elephant hairs and fragile shells ma ke 
up some of the variety of objects 
employed by Saar in her eclectic art 
pieces. In her own words : "I prefer 
things that look old, have a feeling of 
being used and having gone through 
someone's lifetime. That 's a kind of 
power gathering." 

Magic and the occult as well as black 
liberation and nosta lgia themes weave 
her sense of blackness and womanness 
through her work. Her early 
assemblage boxes and prints involved 
mystical imagery of occult arts such as 

astrology , palmistry a nd phrenology in 
a window format. A second style 
emerged in the extens ion of her 
shamanistic sensitivity into more 
organic and primitive materia ls such as 
pods, feath ers, fur a nd leather. Black 
liberation re igned as the theme in a 
third style encompassing a piece 
portraying Aunt Jemima with a spoon 
in one hand and a grenade in the other. 
The subsequent assemblage boxes a re 
more peaceful , as the artist employs 
nostalgia, recreating past lives through 
artifacts such as stocking rosettes and 
ha ndkerchiefs. 

In her current work, Saar states she is 
more involved in " the flow of dreams , 
visions and insights that relate to the 
present and future than the past. " Her 

recent Quasar's Ques' she describes as 
"the universe of the present and the 
future with the shadows of the past 
below. The figure represents universal 

woman, one integrated with the world." 
One of her most famous pieces, a folk 

a ltar entitled Spirit Catcher, was also 
the title of a documentary film on the art 
of Saar, recently ai red on PBS. Both the 
altar, an outgrowth of a grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts to 
study the folk altars of Haiti and 
Mexico, and the film will be included in 
the Mandeville show. 

Saar. now 52, grew up in the middle 
class environment. She spent summers 
with her grandmother in Watts during 
the time that Simon Rodia was building 
his famous Watts Towers by hand out of 
found oddments, acknowledging today 
the imprint the "fairy tale palace" 
made in her mind. This can be seen in 
the similarity oftheskeletal, pyramidal 
framework and ingraining of a 
particular time space by the use of the 
discarded object in her Spirit Catche-:. 

Graduating a design major from 
UCLA in 1949, marriage and children 
then came along and took up the artist 's 
time. Later, she returned to school to 
work on graduate studies and a 
teaching credential. Recently, while 
helping support her three daughters 
through college, she refused to rely on 
the sales of her artwork to meet 
expenses, stating, "I don't want to have 
to sell a piece in order to keep creating; 
that ' s when an artist begins to 
compromise." As a result, she has been 
teaching art at colleges and universities 
for many years , encouraging young 
artists. 

Betye Saar has become one of the 
leading (emale Afro-American artists 
in the country. Quiet, unassuming, 
spiritually attuned, she is a positive 
example and inspiration to the present 
generation of younger Afro-American

Almost Gets 'A' 
Lionheart - Kate Bush 
(Harvest) 

Available only as an import 
for the moment, this Ip features 
mvre of the British inger's 
distincLi\lely sexy and s lightly 
neurotic tunes. Bush is a 
volatile, undisciplined vocalist, 
given to shrieking and cooing as 
the mood strikes her; the 
jarring effect may Lake some 
getting used to. As a songwriter 
she's even more idiosyncratic. 
Her themes on Lionheart range 
from guilt-induced hysteria 
("Hammer Horror") to fear of 
poisoning ("Coffee Home-
ground"). Bush's special forte 
is the openly erotic love ballad.

Made up of people who let their own

Rock Billy Boogie - Robert 
Gordon 
(RCA) 

Gordon wears a peaked 
pompadour. knows how to do-
wop and croon in the manner of 
Elvis the First and evidently 
considers himself a true 
hepcat. His album contains 
songs that the King either sang 
himself ("Blue Christmas" ) or 
could have ("The Catman") . 
The group backing, Gordon 
imitates the ancient, hallowed 
rockabilly sound with pain-
staking accuracy. Everyone 
involved with Rock Billy 
Boogie seems possessed by a 
fanatical determina tion to 
recreate a defunct musical 
style. So what? C. 

Children of the Sun - Billy 
Thorpe

Thorpe . some sort of 
Hollywood leisure suit 
dilettante with blow-dry golden 
locks and an affected cosmic 
awareness, rivals Ele.ktra·s 
Marc Tanner for Most Vacuous 
New Rock Artist of 1979. 
Playing upon a sci-fi motif, his 
Children of the Sun Ip matches 
buzzing guitars (the typical 
L.A. Waddy Wachtel-style 
canned kickass approach) and 
swirling synthesizers against 
spaced-out profundities worthy 
of Gary Wright at his most -
insipid ("We cast our dreams 
into the windl And mother earth 
spins on and on" ... that sort of 
thing). Thorpe's singing 
emulates at times the bluesy 
yelp of Robert Plant, with a 
touch of Bob SeJ(er's quaver 
added, but it's all mannerism-
like the Sial' Wan sound effects 
that embellish the uninspired 
tunes here, his singing is stylish 
but artificial. For all its zooms 
and whooshes. the Ip never 
takes ofr. C Minus. 

Her Father Didn't Like Me 
Anyway - Raphael Ravens-
croft 
(Portrait) 

Ordinarily rock albums built 
around a well-respected 
sideman are dull and pointless 
- a skilled session mu&cian 
isn't ne~sarily a capable Bolo 
artist. In this case the sideman, 
Ravenscroft, became famous 
for his powerful saxophone 
breaks on Gerry Rafferty'S 
"Baker Street." His own Ip, 
surprisingly. is rather 
appealing. The horn arrange-
ments are outstanding , 
showcasing Ravenscroft's rich 
and supple style - unlike Tom 
Scott and most other rock 
reedmen, he isn't afraid to put 
personality into his sax fills . 
The singing is always 
competent on the album and 
sometimes more. though the 
instrumental cuts are the best. 
Good with soft lights and a 
bottle of Lancer's - Ravens-
croft will put you. as they say, 
in a "mellow space." B Minas.

Bid for Coast Zone Change Rejected 
Parking, Master Plan, Drainage Arguments Send UC$D on to Higher Level 

By John Klock 
Senior Staff Wri&er 

UCSD may have to try 
another tack in its efforts to 
have the north end of campus 
removed from the coastal zone, 
after the Regional Coastal 
Commission Friday voted to 
recommend no change in the 
boundary here_ 

Don Sites, associate vice 
chancellor for facilities 
management, said he has 
requested direction from the 
systemwide administration, 
The UC can pursue the matter 
with the State Commission, 
which will be recommending 
boundary changes to the 
legislature, or go straight to the 
legislature with the proposal. 

The commission did say they 
would use ·their legislative 
power to move the bollndary up 
to 100 yards to avoid buildings 

which now straddle the line (in 
Muir campus) , 

Pat Collum, UCSD campus 
and community planner, said 
the case was a "matter of 
politics, " She said she is not 
sure whether it affected the 
outcome, but state Assembly-
man Larry Kapilorf told the 
commission's staff he would 
like to see all of the campus 
west ofInterstate Five included 
in the zone. 

KapilofC's office and the 
commission sta ff confirmed 
this , Kapiloff proposed 
legislation in the last session to 
move the zone boundary in at 
several areas , but it did not 
reach the floor, He is interested 
in pursuing the matter in the 
next session, acco rding to 
Corey Brown, legislative aid

recommend no (major) change 
followed the identical con-
clusion of their sta rr. 

Naney Lucast, coastal 
planner, said there were three 
problems that led to the denial 
of UCSD's request, The first is 
the parking problem presented 
by the on-street parking of 
students and faculty here. One 
of the concerns the commission 
is charged with is protection of 
the access to the coast, and 
Lucast said the on-street 
parking around UCSD makes 

arking unavailable to beaeh 
users, especialy with Black·s 
Beach, and constricts traffic. 

Collum responded th at 
nothing could be done because 

even though adequate parking 
is available on campus, UCSD 
is required to charge for it, and 
people will always opt for 
cheaper off-campus parking. 

Black's Beach is innacces-
sible anyway, she added, 

The second reason cited is the 
lack of a Coastal Master Plan, 
which the commission wants 
UCSD to develop. This would 
commit the campus to follow 
commission policies in the 
future by writing them into the 
master plan. 

Collum said the plan is being 
developed. 

If the area in question does 
not have any effect on the coast, 
as Sites claims, there is no 

reason for it to be considered in 
the plan, 

The third problem is the 
possibility of erosion draJning 
from the canyons to the 
Penasquitos Lagoon, Lucast 
said there was no mechanism 
built in to require UCSD to 
control runoff in the case of 
construction projects, which 
can lead to large amounts of 
siltation. 

Bob Johnson, principal 
engineer for the architect and 
engineering office, said UCSD 
always requires contractors to 
control runoff when it might be 
a problem, and the require-
ment of filing an Environ-
mental Impact Report already 
covers the situation,

actually committed, 

When Newton tried to explain 
to explain that lies and Gary 
are examples of "a police 
conspiracy" against Newton 
and the Panthers, in which 
Oakland pimps and prostitutes 
were supposedly given favors 
by the Oakland police in the 
early 1970 in exchange for 
le liCying against Newton, 
Or loff, incensed, objected 
loudly and yelled "Stop!" when 
Newton tried to c ontinue 
talking. 

However, when proceedings 
resumed two days after the 
incident, Orloff sat passi vely as 
Newton taked oCIles , Gary, and 
Orloff's competence as a 
prosecutor. " You had Jeanette 
lies for 18 months and never 
found out she was in jail the 
night of the murder, " Newton 
taunted. "What kind of a 
prosecutor are you, anyway? " 
Rumors abounded that Orloff 
was gOing to call a surprise 
rebuttal witness to shoot down 
Newton's testimony, 

Orloff did call a rebuttal 
witness, and what she said was 

surprislOg, JoAnne West took 
the stand on the last day of 
testi mony as another eye-
witness to the Smith shooting. 
When asked by Orloff to 
identify Smith's killer, she 
scanned the courtroom, looked 
at Newton, then looked at the 
audience and picked out the 
defense witness Kopen. 

West explained that Kopen 
looked most like the man she 
saw approach Smith with a gun 
shortly before she turned and 
fled the scene, She added that 
she, like Buie, "was on drugs" 
when the shooting occurred and 
that she was not certain who 
killed Smith. 

Orloff seemed almost to 
surrender the case in his 
closing argument when he 
asked the jury to convict 
Newton of second degree 
murder rather than first degree 
murder, which would mean 
that Newton killed Smith 
without considering the act or 
its consequences, A confident 
Newton predicted, "When the 
jury goes out they'll be back in 
an hour," 

But the jury was not back in 
an hour, The jury was out for

McElroy Investigates Hut Conversion

According to Ryer, a final 
decision on the faculty club 
conversion will be made 
sometime this summer, The 
next two months wilt-be spent 
attempting to devise a bid 
package, he said. 

Bids may be sent out in June. 
remarked Ryer, and bidders 
will be given either one or two 
months to respond, A decision 
"should be known by the end of

Stolman commented that 
students "would look at (a 
summer decision) as being 
done behind their backs." By 
not making a decision during 
this quarter or the fall quarter. 
said Stolman. students would 
"further distrust" adminis-
trators and would feel that " the 
administration does not care 
what they (students) want." 

AS President John Jenkel 
called the likely summer 
decision " poor form" and said 
'he would encourage the faculty 
club committee to make its 
choice before or after the

opposed the replacement of the 
Coffee Hut with a faculty club, 
McElroy recenlly commented 
that the petition was ineffective 
because students didn 't come 
up with a solution to the food 
facility 's fina ncial difficulties. 

The Coffee Hut experienced a 
large deficit last year .

The 1964 concert of the 
BeatIes was shortlived because 
of its fans' re fusill to quiet 
down, Only when the group left 
via helicopter minutes after 
their arrival did they submit to 
a humbling silence. The 1979 
performance of Beatlemania 
has given the ci ty a second
