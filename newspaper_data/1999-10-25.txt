TEL AVIV, Israel - Samuel

The prison term, negotiated 
earlier in a plea bjlrgain between 
Israeli prosecutors and 
Sheinbein's lawyer, has already 
been denounced as too lenient by

said by lawyers here Sunday to

Council Questions UCAB 
VOTE: Investigation finds that UCAB acted in accordance with policies 
By JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

An investigation prompted 
by A.S. Council members' con-
cerns concluded Friday that the 
University Centers Advisory 
Board (UCAB) operated in 
accord with campus policies 

. regarding this week's special 
election. 

In a resolution passed 
Wednesday, the A.S. Council 
stated it "condemns the actions 
taken by UCA B during the peri-
od leading up to the special 
election of the University 
Centers Expansions." 

The council expressed con-

cern that UCAB is both the 
organizer of this week's .special 
election and proponent of the 
expansion, and that equal fund-
ing had not been provided to 
both the "pro" and "con" 
efforts. 

The resolution also claimed 
that UCAB had not been coop-
erative in providing informa-
tion to the A.S. Council con-
cerning its financial expendi-
tures in support of the Price 
and Student Centers expansion. 

Lynne Peterson,. acting assis-
tant vice chancellor of student 
programs and facilities, investi-
gated the allegations. In a letter 
written Friday, Peterson stated 

that UCAB had acted in accord 
with current campus policies 
concerning special elections. 
She also stated that $200 had 
been allocated to both UCAB 
and to students representing 
the opposing side. 

Claims by the A.s. Council 
that UCAB attempted to sup-
press opponents are fa lse, said 
Brian Cross, UCAB student 
chair. The council claimed that 
UCAB did not help the "con" 
campaign to form. 

Cross pointed out that, 
when running for office, candi-
dates are not required to seek

Langley Says All-Campus Ceremony Should End 
DECISION: A.S. President Tesh Khullar says council may hold its own all-campus commencement 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Vice Chancellor of 
Development and University 
Relations Jim Langley recom-
mended to Chancellor Robert 
Dynes earlier this month that he . 
cancel the all-campus commence-
ment. Langley said that Dynes 
will decide the fate of the ceremo-
ny within the next few weeks. 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
said that if Dynes decides to can-
cel the ceremony, the A.S. 
Council may hold its own all-
campus commencement. 

For the past three years, 
UCSD has held an all-campus 
commencement in addition to 
individual college commence-
ments. The ceremonies were part 
of a three-year experiment to see 
if the campus community would 
support such a ceremony on an 
annual basis. 

Langley said that the $130,000 
spent on last year 's ceremony 
was not well spent because only 
500-750 students attended. 

"We had analyzed the num-
bers from last year's commence-
ment and found the student and 
faculty turnout disappointing," 

Langley said. 
He also said that the money 

spent on the ceremony should 
instead be used for another pro-
gram that will enhance the 
undergraduate experience. 

Langley added that last year 's 
lack of a nationally prominent 
speaker contributed to the low 
turnout. 

"You run a much higher risk if 
this is what commencement 
depends upon," he said. "We 
must be honest and realize that 
not every year can we attract [a 
speaker of national prominence)." 

Khullar said he hopes the A.S. 

Council will pass a resolution 
Wednesday stating that students 
are in favor of an all-campus 
commencement. 

He said that last yea r's low 
turnout should not be used as 
the basis for canceling the cere-
mony. 

"Last year was really a bad 
inaicator," Khullar said. "It was 
canceled and reinstated and there 
was a lot of confusion. It was not 
properly run in my opinion." 

Khullar said he will meet with 
Dynes soon and that a committee 
should meet immediately to select 
a commencement speaker.

Community Celebrates 
Life of Sherley Williams 
MEMORIAL: UCSD remembers late professor 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Guardian Reporter 

Members of the UCSD com-
munity celebrated the life and 
legacy of Sherley Anne Williams 
last Thursday at the Mandell 
Weiss Forum Theatre. 

Williams, a celebrated African-
American author, poet, playwright 
and literature professor, died on 
July 6 at the age of 54. 

Floyd Gaffney, ,., rofessor 
emeritus of theater, and 
Literature Professor Rosaura 
Sanchez, served as Masters of 
Ceremonies at the event, which 
featured dramatic readings of 
Williams' poetry and her novel 
Dessa Rosa. lt also featured musi-
cal performances and native 
dances of the African culture 
that Williams championed all 
her life. 

After a brief introduction, 
Omo Ache, a group of dancers, 
ingers and musicians, performed 

the Fiesta Congo and Afrekete, 
both lively dances illustrating 
various ways of life of the Afro-
Cuban people. 

A soloist from Williams' 
church performed a rendition of 
"The Wind Beneath My Wings," 
singing at the end, "Sherley, you 
are the wind beneath my wings." 

Joyce Justus, who worked 
with Williams when she first 
arrived at UCSD, explained how 
passionate Williams was about 
organizing the African American 
women of the campus. 

"She said to me 'We have to 
find all the African American 

women on this campus, wherever 
they are, and create an organiza-
tion,'" Justus said. "And that is 
the lasting memory 1 have of 
UCSD; women being there for 
each other because of Sherley." 

Andrew Wright, professor 
emeritus of literature, spoke next 
b ·fore reading lines from Walt 
Whitman's Leaves of Grass, 
explaining that it exemplified the 
peace that he is sure Williams is 
enjoying now. 

He also said that Williams 
brought a lot to the campus. 

"Sherley was deep, sympa-
thetic and had a sense of joy; she 
gave luster to UCSD." 

Many others spoke, including 
Carlos Blanco-Aguinaga, profes-
sor emeritus of literature. 

"Sherley will live in my mem-
ory until r die," he said. " We 
spent much time talking about 
the minorities in this country. r 
would tell her about Spanish 
American poets and she would 
tell me about the Harlem 
Renaissance. She was always 
beautiful in that all-embracing 
sense; beautiful outside and 
beautiful in her soul." 

A dramatic reading of Williams' 
novel, DesSil Rose, the story of a 
black pregnant slave and the 
Southern white woman who 
befriends lier, elicited a standing 
ovation from the audience. The 
reading was originally adapted for 
"Black Women Writers and the 
'High Art' of Afro-American 
Letters," a May 1998 conference

The enate's failure to ratify the test ban treaty 
re presents America's latest foreign policy disaster 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Staff Writer 

Last week, in another irrational 
American foreign policy blunder, the U.s. 
Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test 

. Ban Treaty (CTBT) that more than 40 
countries signed a few years ago. There is 
li tt le doubt that this rejection is another 
move in the never-ending political fight 
between Congress and the White House 
that has been raging since 1994. In these 
days, when American foreign policy is 
more and more the bas tard son of 
Washington's internal battles under the 
push for isolationism and particularism, 
thiS is hardly a surprise. 

of Americans favored ratification. 
The concerns of the world and of 

America's allies are not a concern for the 
isolationist right, which for years has been 
questioning the role of the United 
Nations, and which apparently still 
believes that this nation can be an 
autarchic island. 

The obvious question is: What now? 
There will be, I believe, two orders of con-
sequences: practical and political. 

The extent of the practical conse-
quences is hard to estimate. In an age like 
this, in which every dictator can buy 
nuclear technology from any piece of the 
former Soviet Union, the failure of an 
international agreement that-would allow 

If there is anything 
su rprising in this vote, it 
is the appa rent noncha-
lance with which the 
Senate IS willing to kill 
America's moral and 
strategic leadership in 
the world just to carry 
out a provincial vendet' 
ta against an indiscreet 
president that they 
couldn't Impeach. 

ro 
monitoring of nuclear 
tests - at least in princi-
ple - will certainly be a 
destabilizing factor. 

The treaty, as the 
republicans pointed out, 
was not perfect, but it 
allowed the deployment 
of a network of monitor-

bil ities. Although the 

The vote also reveals the preoccupied 
lack of strategic thought in the White 
House. The democrats, trying to crea te an 
international legacy for the Clinton presi-
dency after eight years of less-than-effec-
tive foreign policy (to make an under-
statement), decided to submit the treaty to 
the Senate, rea lizing too late that they had 
entered a politica l trap. 

The Republican right wing, composed 
of senators like Jesse Helms - the funda-
mentalist tail that wags the Republican 
dog - found the perfect occasion to 
humiliate Clin ton in front of the world 
and the nation, blissfully neglecting the 
fact that America 's traditional allies were 
counting on the treaty, and that 83 percent 

network would not provide certain detec-
tion of small-sca le nuclear explosions, we 
can imagine that with adequate techno-
logical deployment, monitoring could be 
improved. Not to mention that without a 
treaty, no form of verification is legally 
possible. 

Once it had been proven that the treaty 
worked, new treaties could have been 
negotiated to increase the monitoring 
capability of the international community. 
All th is disappeared with the Senate vote 
last week. It is not hard to predict that

Pakistan, or the increasingly integra list

Fallout 
The inherent flaws of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty led to its defeat on the Senate floor 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

On Sept. 13, the U.S. Senate failed to 
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty (CTBT), which would prohibit 
any of the signing states from conduct-
ing further nuclear tests, by a vote of 48 -
51 (one Senator simply voted "present"). 

I am not going to become entangled in 
arguing whether the treaty's defeat in the 
Senate was partisan or politically moti-
vated. As long as this country's politics 
are based on the two-party system, there 
will be partisan voting. You might not like 
it - I certainly don't - but that's not the 
issue. 

The important 

The CTBT includes a "supreme 
national interests" clause that would 
allow any signing state to withdraw 
from the treaty, should anything happen 
that would call into question th·e reliabil-
ity of their nuclear weapons and necessi-
tate further testing. This clause would 
allow any participating nation to resume 
testing after giving six months' notice to 
the other signing states. If the govern-
ment of any of the member states is over-
thrown or experiences a change of poli-
cy, there is nothing in the treaty to pre-
vent them from reneging on their agree-
ment. 

In effect, this treaty would not change 
U.S. policy regarding nuclear testing, 

which was set by 
President Bush's 1992 issue is why the treaty 

was not ratified: It is 
ineffectual, unenforce-
able, and not in the 
best interests of the 
United States nor the 
international commu-
nity. con 

moratorium on the 
detonation of nuclear 
devices. The United 
States has no present 
plans to conduct any 
further nuclear testing 
unless the integrity of 
our nuclear stockpiles 
is called into question. 

Decrying the rejec-
tion of the CTBT sim-
ply because it is the 

GUARDIAN OPINION 

first major international treaty that the 
U.S. Senate has failed to ratify since the 
1919 Treaty of Versailles that was to create 
the Leape of Nations treaty is just so 
much bluster. The Senate is not obligated 
to sign any treaty placed before it simply 
to maintain a perfect track record. 
Comparing the CfBT to the failed Treaty 
of Versailles is ludicrous - the Treaty of 
Versailles was rejected by an isolationist 
Senate that foolishly wanted the United 
States to withdraw from international 
affairs. The CTST was rejected because it 
is an impractical and short-sighted agree-
ment that is not suited to international 
nuclear security threats in the post-Cold 
War era. 

The U.s. delegation 
responsible for redrafting the treaty has 
already made it clear that if the integrity 
of our nuclear arsenal does come into 
doubt, our country will exercise its option 
to withdraw from the treaty and resume 
testing. As far as internal US. policy is 
concerned, there is no practical reason for 
our country to ratify the treaty. 

The prospects o( actually being able to 
enforce the treaty are dismal. Seismic sen-
sors and other monitoring stations that are 
currently in use failed to register some of 
India and Pakistan's nuclear tests last 
year. 

The CTST made some rather optimistic

Apathy Plagues Elections 
COMMENTARY: The implementation of online voting is not enough 
By KEVIN SEID 
Staff Writer 

Last April, low voter turnout 
plagued the A.S. elections, caus-
ing the fai lure of a fee referen-
dum on the ballot to fund the 
expansion of both the Price 
Center and the Student Center. 
Although it received majority 
support, the measure needed 
more student votes to pass. 

Now the· University Centers 
Adv isory Boa rd (UCAB) has 
orga nized a special election 
th rough UCSD's on-line service 
Studentlink in an effort to pass 
the fee referendum. They expect 
that the on-line vote will facili-
tate student participation by 
negating problems such as poor 
weather, distance from campus 
and conflicting schedules with 
polling times. 

Facilitating student participa-
tion may encourage more stu-
dents to vote, but only enough to 
pass the measure. There is a 
more important problem affect-
ing voter participation that is 
being overlooked: voter apathy. 
There are too many UCSD stu-
dents who are not interested in 
voting. 

Apathy is caused by three 
major factors. One of them is 
ignorance. Students will not vote 
if they do not know that there is 
a special election being held. In 
addition, those who know very 
little about the issues will not be 
interested in voting because they 
are unable to make an informed 
decision. 

Second, voter apat~y can per-
sist when people feel out of 
touch. They believe that the 
issues addressed in the election 

do not significantly impact their 
busy lives. These people feel that 
neither their opinion nor their 
vote will make any difference in 
the election. 

The third factor that can lead 
to apathy is the voters' percep-
tions of the costs and benefits. A 
person who does not see any 
benefits from voting will not 
spend their valuable time to cast 
a vote. On the other hand, pe0-
ple will vote if they feel that it is 
worth the cost of doing so. 

I! is very easy for juniors and 
seniors to feel indifferent 
towards an issue like the 
University Centers fee referen-
dum. They may not see any ben-
efits from voting one way or the 
other. If the measure is passed, 
the expansion project will not 
open until 2002, and the $25 fee 
increase will not be collected 
until the new facilities are com-
pleted. . 

By 2002, current upperclass-
men will already have graduat-
ed and left UCSD. The only ones 
who would be affected by the 
measure are freshmen and 
sophomores planning to stay for 
a fifth year. 

Those students who are indif-
ferent must be persuaded by oth-

the 
you'll ta 
Are you a student who: 

ers to vote. Those who already 
favor one side or the other 
should make every effort to 
spread the word and persuade as 
many students as they can. 

Campaign messages should 
be sent out to every place on 
campus. It is not enough just to 
post a few signs and distribute 
fliers in the Price and Student 
Centers and -place an ad in the 
Guardia/I . Few students visit the 
University Centers or read the 
Guardiall on a regular basis. ~ 
Every single student must be 
notified by whatever means nec-
essary, regardless of whether 
they live on campus. 

More importantly, the cam-
paign message should get stu-
dents' attention. I! must provide 
students with new information 
and insight on the expansion 
measure. It should get them to 
look at the issues in a new and 
different light. 
I Campaigns should change 
people's perceptions of the costs 
and the benefits of voting on the 
issue. They must convince stu-
dents that these issues really 
impact them and that their vote 
actually counts. The messages 
should make people truly care 
about what is at stake and get 
them so emotionally involved 
and passionate that they are 
compelled to voice their opin-
ions. 

Campaign messages should 
also be tailored to different audi-
ences. Messages to upperclass-
men should be different than the 
ones aimed at freshmen. The slo-
gan "Want more, vote yes!" cur-
rently used by the UCAB's .cam-

and old alike) to pursue higher education? 

CON: 
Proposed treaty 
would be dangerous 
CoIt ....... d froIII ..... 4 
projections about the advance of 
technologies required to monitor 
nuclear explOSions. The treaty 
outlined the research of hydroa-
coustic, radionuclide, seismic and 
infrasound monitoring technolo-
gies to be implemented by the 
International Monitoring System. 
Only a few of these monitoring 
technologies have been devel-
oped to date, and India and 
Pakistan's nuclear tests have 
called into question these existing 
technologies' reliability. If the 
international community cannot 
monitor nuclear tests, the treaty is 
useless. It amounts to a gentle-
men's agreement not to conduct 
further testing, and governments 
these days seem to be in short 
supply of gentlemen. 

The greatest unknown factors 
in the post-Cold War nuclear age 
- India, Pakistan and North 
Korea - have not yet signed, let 
alone ratified, the treaty. fndia has 
alluded again and again that it 
has no intention of signing ever, 
and after the Oct. 12 military 
takeover of the elected govern-
ment in Pakistan, it seems likely 
that this nascent nuclear power 
will refrain from ratifying the 
treaty as well. 

So long as these states do not 
ratify the CTBT, it will not go into 
effect. There is a possibility of 
redrafting the treaty to remove 
these nations, but having the rest 
of the world adopt an agreement 
on nuclear testing that these 
potentially aggressive states will 
not consent to is folly. It only 
encourages their own weapons 
development programs by sepa-
rating them from the rest of the 
international community. 

Monday. October 25. 1999 

Insofar as it has been promot-
ed as a measure to prevent an 
arms race, the CTBT is an abject 
failure. The CTBT does not pre-
vent the development of nuclear 
weapons or missile delivery vehi-
cles in any way. It merely pro-
hibits the detonation of a nuclear 
device. As such, the CTBT would 
not prevent any signing nations 
- including Iraq, Iran, India, 
Pakistan and North Korea -
from initiating or completing 
their own nuclear weapons pro-
grams. 

Furthermore, by banning test-
ing, the treaty would create a 
dangerous situation where new 
nuclear powers, which do not 
have as much scientific expertise 
in handling nuclear weapons as 
the United States or Russia, will 
be building stockpiles of untest-
ed weapons. The reliability of 
these countries' nuclear arsenals 
would be questionable, which 
might lead to nuclear accidents 
with environmental damage far 
worse than any controlled test 
explosion. 

TIle truly ridiculous feature of 
this treaty is that it in no way pro-
hibits the military use of nuclear 
weapons. The CTBT would pro-
hibit peaceful testing of nuclear 
weapons, but neither it nor any 
treaty prohibits an act of war using 
a nuclear weapon. 

The U.S. authors of the treaty 
admitted that this goal was "total-
ly beyond the scope of this treaty 
and the mandate for its negotia-
tion." 

TIle U.s. Senate recently ratified 
a treaty prohibiting the use of 
chemical weapons, but as far as the 
world is concerned, nuclear 
exchanges are still fair game. If the 
international community cannot 
even forge an agreement to prohib-
it an aggressive attack using a 
nuclear weapon, what is the Iikeli-

UCAB Takes Authority Out of Student Hands 
Editor: 

The students on this campus 
have been treated as if we were 
fools ever since the University 
Center Advisory Board (UCAB) 
launched the campaign for a Price 
Center Expansion Referendum. 

This is not going to be another 
one of those revolutionary 
attempts to block the expansion 
of the Student and Price Centers. 
In fact, we would indeed be fools 
not to agree with providing 
UCSD students with more 
resources and facilities to conduct 
student life in a more pleasant 
and comfortable manner. 

However, there are still issues 
that UCAB refuses to address. 
UCAB is in a privileged position to 
massively promote its campaign · 
and ideologies, neglecting to 
inform students of other facts and 
perspectives. We want to take this 
chance to educate the students on 
the truth behind the UCAB Price 
Center Expansion campaign so 
that students can make an educat-
ed choice regarding the expansion. 

UCAB was once officially 
known as the Student Center 
Board (SCB). The SCB, whose 
responsibilities included oversee-
ing the expansion of student facil-
ities, was made a subSidiary of 
ASUCSD to ensure that students 
did not "lose control of student 
facilities" or their student fees. 
The SCB was composed entirely 
of students, without any adminis-
trative intervention. 

Along with a name change 
from SCB to UCAB, this board has 
been made an advisory council to 
Vice Chancellor Joe Watson, with 
no actual decision-making power. 
The power structure has shifted 
from the students to the adminis-
tration, diluting the ability of stu-
dents to decide what they want. 

Case in point: VCA8's student 
representatives are supposed to be 
informing all students about the 
issues regarding the University 
Centers. Technically, UCAB is not 
in session without the majority of

its members, primarily durinL the 
summer months when the majori-
ty of its members are away. 
However, during this time, all of 
the logistics regarding the upcom-
ing election and the planning 
behind the Pro campaign for the 
student self-assessed fee referen-
dum took place withoutany input 
from the general student popu-
lace. The fact that students were 
not informed forces us to question 
the motives behind the special 
election taking place on Oct. 25-29. 

We are told to vote Yes on the 
Price Center Expansion without 
being informed of the possible 
adverse consequences of such an 
expansion. This election is being 
presented to the students of 
UCSD from one viewpoint only. 
There has not been any discus-
sion about a Con side, and it was-
n't until recently that UCAB has 
attempted to publicly address the 
Con side per the request of the 
A.S. Council. 

We were led to believe, as in 
any other legitimate election, that 
this election was going to be fair. 
In reality, the Pro side has been 
abundantly funded through stu-
dent fees, whereas the Con side 
was never given a fair opportuni-
ty to educate students that there 
are issues that have been raised 
against the proposal. Every issue 
has two sides. 

We, the elected representatives 
of the students, are concerned over 
this one-sided propaganda cam-
paign and have taken it upon our-
selves to truly educate students. 

Our concerns stem from the 
fact that there are issues that could 
pose problems if the student self-
assessed fee referendum is passed. 
These concerns regarding the spe-
cial election are as follows: 

There is a proposed fee 
increase every five years without 
the consent of the student popu-
lation, shifting control of student 
fees from students to administra-
tive bodies. Although UCAB will 
vote for or against this increase,

one has to take into account that 
UCAB is only an advisory board. 
We feel that any time student fees 
are increased, students should be 
the ones to vote for the increase. 

There are no blueprints or for-
mal plans for the new expansion. 
To make a truly educated decision, 
it would be best to see some plan 
on exactly how the money is going 
to be spent if we, the students, are 
going to be funding it. 

Students already have prob-
lems using the Price Center facili -
ty due to the volume of corporate, 
outside organizations using the 
space. As students, we should not 
be considered secondary to these 
outside entities. There is no guar-
antee that students will be put 
ahead of corporations paying big 
bucks to rent the facilities for 
which we are paying. 

There appears to be a conflict 
of interest in the UCAB's organiz· 
ing the special elections, as well 
as acting as the proponent of the 
Price Center and Student Center 

expansion. 
There are ethical concerns over 

the procedure, follow-through 
and planning of the speCIal elec-
tion on the part of the UCA B. 

These are just a few of the 
items that we would include in a 
discussion fo r a Con campaign. 

This could prove to be a cru-
cial election for the students of 
UCSD in that, if the referendum is 
passed, future efforts to increase 
student fees through referen-
dums could again be steamrolled.

Why Columnists 
Are Dumb 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to 
"Looking For Ms. Not So Bad" 
(Oct. 18). Now, if the Guardian is 
short of good writers with read-
worthy material, why didn' t you 
place an ad requesting talent? 
Nevertheless, I am not an aspir-
ing joumalist, yet my major does 
require argumentative papers. 
So, let's begin. 

The contributing staff writer 
spills on for half a page, promot-
ing himself as the Christopher 
Columbus of the notion that we 
all seek someone who is "good 
conversation. " 

Well, duh! Most of us learned 
this after dating that really hot 
football player on our high school 
team. The ability to "talk" with 
someone is an essential compo-
nent to any lasting relationship. 
This sets a foundation tbward the 
exchange of thought, which inad-
vertently challenges your partner 
to express his or her personality in 
ways they would not normally, 
had you not initially "sparked" the 

conversation - the Interest -
from the get-go. 

My roommate Jess helped POint 
out that there Me several examples 
of great literature that ildvocate the 
above idea, from Pride alld 
PreJlldice to All/Ie oj Grl'c!1I Gabl,'s. 
But I'd like to refer to my all-time 
favorite movie for some support 
for my argument that "good con-
versation" is no revelation. 

In " When Harry Mrl Sally" there 
is a scene at the end of the movie in 
which Harry has come to the real-
ization that he loves Sa lly. His evi-
dence for his feelings, aside from 
loving the smell of her perfume on 
his clothes after he's spent the day 
with her, or the crinkle she gets on 
her forehead when she looks at 
him like he's crazy, is none other 
than the fact that Sally is the last 
person Harry wants to talk to 
before he goes to sleep. And it's 
not because he's lonely and it's not 
because it's the holidays. Good 
conversation is what we all seek. It 
allows us to see more than a 
glimpse of that someone's person-
ality - which, I'd like to add - is 
something women possess. 

There will always be com-
plaints from both the male and 
female ranks. Yet, our art icles on 
"Why Guys are Dumb" usually 
stem from boys who are content 
with settling for Ms. Not So Bad. 
So, to the contributing staff writer, 
I'd like to suggest to you to move 
to Luzern, Switzerland . After all, 
as the rest of us know, no com-
panion will be worth "growin~ 
old with" ("The Wedding Singer') 
or meeting on the top of the 
Empire State Building (" All Affair 
10 Remember") unless she's the'last 
person you want to talk to before 
you go to sleep. 

If you don't catch this now, I 
fear you'll be in a passionless 
marriage to the President of 
Czechoslovakia rather than hav-
ing the greatest sex of your life 
with that girl who xou can truly 
talk to ("Casablallca' ).

Ironically, unlike the United

Nevertheless, it is hard to pre-

The fact of the matter is, the

The vote, unfortunately, also 
sends the allies of the United 
States the message tharthe polit-
ical and strategic leadership of 
America is finished . Years of iso-
lationism has left our allies wor-
rying whether the American 
giant could still be considered a 
reliable ally, and the ambiguous 
participation of the United States 
in the United Nations (praised 
when they agree to be a mere 
instrument of Washington poli-
cy, attacked when they try to 
impose their own decisions) has 
left more than one country won-
dering whether the Pax 
Americana could really repre-
sent a stable solution for the 
world . 

Just a few months ago, the 
European nations overcame their 
doubts and substantial internal 

ting on a shelf for ten years and 
simply forget. The very nature of 
their components lead to deterio-
ration and complications that we 
are still in the process of learning 
about. 

As far as our understanding 
of nuclear weapons has 
advanced over the fifty years 
since their invention, and as safe 
as our nuclear stockpiles have 
been to date, we still do not 
know everything about them. 
The weapons currently in the 
U.S. nuclea r arsenal are older 
now than ever before. There are 
still serious questions about 
nuclear weapons' safety and 
reliability that need to be 
answered in order to ensure that 
these weapons remain safe.

opposition to support the NATO 
intervention in Kosovo. In the 
name of the same international 
commitments, the European 
Union provided troops under 
the UN flag in the Balkans, and 
Australia provided troops for 
peacekeeping operations in East 
Timor. 

Now, the sight of an important 
piece of international legislation 
prostituted to the provincial bat-
tle between the Republican right 
and the preSident will force the 
other countries to draw negative 
conclusions. The 21st century will 
have to do without American 
leadership. It is hard to imagine 
what country or coalition of 
countries will be able to take its 
place in an age with an indecisive 
Europe, a troubled Russia, a weak 
UN and courtyard dictators with 
nuclear devices. 

While the damage to the 
American position could be 
irreparable, the cause of nuclear 
control can still be salvaged. The 
most responsible people in 
Congress and the White House 

puter models can only take us so 
far in furthering this knowledge, 
simply because nuclear 
weapons have never been stored 
for this long. You cannot create 
computer simulations for condi-
tions that have never been 
observed: 

For these reasons it may be 
necessary to conduct a few real-
world tests in the coming years. 
The United States should not 
conduct frequent or wanton test-
ing. We should not reinstate 
atmospheric testing. We should 
not jeopardize the health of our 
own citizens or the citizens of 
other countries. But we should 
definitely retain the option of 
testing in the event that it 
becomes necessary. Otherwise 
we may find ourselves in a posi-

should work together to control 
the damage. The Department of 
State has pledged not to test any 
nuclear device but to continue 
with computer simulation. The 
treaty can be revived in 2001, 
with a new Congress that will 
hopefully be less parochial than 
this one, and a new president. 

Neither George W. Bush nor 
Al Gore is decisively isolationist 
but, in this age of poll politics, 
the most important thing is the 
willingness of the American pe0-
ple to consider foreign policy 
problems as relevant political 
issues. 

The problem, ultimately, is to 
force politicians to perform ratio-
nal and dispassionate analyses of 
the world and of America's role 
in it. They must make a serious 
and coherent foreign policy an 
important campaign issue. There 
isn't much time to waste. The 
tone of the debate and the role 
that foreign policy will have in it 
in the next few months will be 
crucial.

tion where our own weapons are 
the worst nuclear threat to our 
nation. 

This treaty is not about disar-
mament. It is not about non-pro-
liferation. it is about trying to 
hide an unpleasant necessity in a 
negligent and irresponsible man-
ner. What is really needed is an 
international agreement to stop 
new countries from striving to 
gain the dubious honor of jOin-
ing the nuclear club. The coun-
tries that currently have nuclear 
weapons may need to test them 
from time to time to ensure their 
safety, and unless they intend to 
completely eliminate their 
nuclear stockpiles, it would be 
ill-advised to ask them to cease 
testing completely.

Students must be

paign may appeal to freshmen 
but is ineffective in persuading 
upperclassmen who are going to 
graduate before the new facilities 
open. 

Upperclassmen must be .::on-
vinced why they should vote for or 
against a measure that essentially 
will only affect future students. 
These campaigns have to appeal to 
them at a different level. 

On the other hand, campaigns 
aimed at freshmen should remind 
them that the measure will direct-
ly impact their lives at UCSD 
w hen they become seniors. 

A town meeting like the one 
that was held for this issue is a 
great way for students to get per-
sonally involved in discussing 
the issues. But having only one 
on a Friday afternoon is ineffec-
tive, because that time is inconve-
nient for many students. Holding 
a few town meetings at dffferent 
times of the week would be bet-
ter - it may not be as practical, 
but it would enable more stu-
dents to have a chance to get 
involved. 

The challenge is to increase 
voter turnout by finding practical 
and effE!Ctiv;: ways of overcoming 
voter apathy among students. ff 
issues continue to be geared 
towards only a small portion of the 
student population, then only a 
minority of people will voice their 
opinions. 

The fee referendum may pass 
this time around, but it may not 
reflect the sentiment of the entire 
student body. A few people will 
dictate their wishes to the rest. 
What we will have is an oli-
garchy, not a democracy.

Right-Wing Political Party Leads in 
Swiss Election Exit Polls

page sentencing report. 

Sheinbein's parents listened to 
Goren detail t~e strangulation 
and subsequent dismemberment

said to have been a friend of 
Samuel Sheinbein and his accom-

GENEVA - Switzerland's 
most right-wing political party 
surged t6 stunning gains on 
Sunday in the country's parlia-
mentary elections, apparently 
capturing the largest share of the 
vote nationwide and raising 
fears that this middle-of-the-
road country is following its 
neighbor Austria into political 
conservatism. 

Televised exit polls from the 
nationwide elections showed the 
Swiss People's Party captured 
some 23 percent of the votes cast 
for Switzerland's lower house, 
up from 15 percent in the last 
elections in 1995. If the trend 
holds, the People's Party, an 
anti-immigrant, anti-tax and 
anti-European Union group 
dominated by outspoken indus-
trialist Christoph Blocher, could 
remake Switzerland's staid 
political map. 

Pre-election polls had pre-
dicted that Blocher's party, 
which is centered in the 
German-speaking portion of 
Switzerland, would overtake the 
left-leaning Social Democrats 
and the two center-right parties 
to become Switzerland's pre-
eminent political party.

Trivia Show Encourages 
Web Participation 

In the media industry's latest 
attempt to attain true conver-
gence of television and the 
Internet, MTV plans to start a 
music-trivia game show in which 
viewers can play along by log-
ging onto MTV's web site. 

The program, "Web Riot," will 
debut on Nov. 29, but MTV plans 
to begin promoting it Monday and 
to let potential players begin 
downloading the requisite PC soft-
ware from the MTV web site. 

As MTV prepares for the pro-
gram's premiere, media execu-
tives wj(( be waiting for MTV to 
prove that the time for conver-
gence has finally arrived - even 
if the estimated 44 percent of U.S. 
households with Internet access 
is still far below the nearly 80 per-
cent that subscribe to cable or 
satellite television services that 
carry MTV. 

"It can give us a good indica-
tion of the realities of multitask-

vice president for broadcasting 
and programming with the

the Reform nomination. 

Buchanan brushed aside 
Trump's charges of anti-Semitism 
as he courted Reform Party offi-
cials at a reception here Sunday 
in advance of his expected 
announcement of a party 
crossover. 

"To get in a slanging match 
with someone is not why I'm 
doing this," he told reporters out-
side the Westin Fairfax Hotel. 

Trump is considered by 
Buchanan supporters as a straw 
man fronting for the wing of the 
Reform Party aligned with Gov. 
Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, a fac-
tion that is opposed to a 
Buchanan candidacy. But Trump 
insisted that his own decision to 
quit the Republican Party was 
rooted in philosophical differ-

advertising firm of McCann-
Erickson Worldwide. 

MTV's research indicates that 
51 percent of its audience mem-
bers between 12 and 24 years old 
have Internet access, and that 
many of the networks' viewers 
often watch the cable channel 
while surfing the web. 

"Those two experiences seem 
to live comfortably together in 
their lives," said Judy McGrath, 
president of MTV. 

During the half-hour program 
each weekday afternoon, up to 
25,000 "Web Riot" viewers, 
watching both their television 
and personal computer screens, 
will be able to play along with 
four on-air contestants. 

MTV will show clips from 
music videos and then multiple-
choice questions on television. 
Participants at home will use the 
numbers on their computer key-

personal pubhdty. 

"I really believe the 
Republicans are just too crazy 
right," he said when disclosing 
that he would register with the 
Independence Party, the New York 
version of the Reform Party. He 
said he would begin meeting with 
Reform Party officials in the next 
few months and make a decision 
by March about whether to run. 

Trump, who has never been a 
p?litical candidate, clearly timed 
his announcement to target 
Buchanan, acidly denouncing 
him on the NBC News program 
"Meet the Press" as the candidate 
of the "really staunch right 
wacko vote." 

Asked how he might fare 
against a millionaire opponent,

election, endangering his coun-
try's coalition government. 

Similarly, the success of 
Switzerland's ardent nationalists 
threatens this country's so-called 
"magic formula" - the govern-
ing coalition of the country's 
four political parties which has 
balanced regional interests and 
its four language groups -
French, italian, German and 
Romansch - since 1959. 

Interviewed on Swiss televi-
sion, Blocher said the party 
would demand a second seat on 
the seven-member Swiss federal 
council, the cabinet-like body 
that runs the country. 

Until now, his party had one 
seat, with the remaining slots 
shared among the Social 
Democrats, the centrist Christian 
Democrats and the free-market 
Radical Party, all of which 
appeared to lose support on

Blocher 's demand could 
mean that traditional Swiss con-

Colleges Wooing Minorities 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. - It was 

not yet 8:30 on a Saturday morn-
ing, but as soon as Kara Beverly 
climbed aboard Amtrak train 
No. 84 in Washington, she had 
Ralph Ellison's Tnvisible Man 
open on her lap. 

She scanned the seats in the 
car reserved br Brown University 
for this specia recruibnent trip to 
its campus here. 

"Are there any chemistry 
people here?" she asked no one 
in particular. 

There were, indeed, plenty of 
thick chemistry textbooks tucked 
inside the backpacks that crowd-
ed the overhead bins. Physics, 
too. And calculus. It was a train 
full of students balancing 
Advanced Placement courses 
with responsibilities for the 
National Honor Society, teen-
agers who had scored 1~ (out 
of a possible 1600) on their SATs 
but were retaking them this fall in 
hopes of even higher numbers. 

There was another thing that 
stood out. 

"Wow," marveled Joe 
Williams, as he boarded the train 

in New Carrollton, Md. 
"Everybody's black." 

In the increasingly competi-
tive environment of applying to 
elite colleges, the still small 
number of high-achieving 
African American students are 
among the most coveted -
wooed with free trips to cam-
puses, personal attention from 
administrators and alumni, and 
a bevy of scholarships. 

The battles over affirmative 
action that have led many insti-
tutions to back away from giv-
ing preferences to minority 
applicants have intensified these 
recruiting efforts as colleges seek 
ways to keep their campuses 
racially mixed. . 

''The top minority students 
are recruited like rock stars, 
they're really courted," said 
Esther Hugo, coordinator of 
multicultural affairs for the 
National Association of College 
Admissions Counselors. 

For the 100 students aboard 
this train as it trudged up the East 
Coast for a weekend of getting-
to-know-you programs called the 

Black Experience at Brown, the 
free ticket is part of a courtship 
that began during junior year 
and will stretch into spring. 

But as the foliage outside the 
windows grew more colorful, it 
became clear that the trek north, 
in itself, was a key part of the 
experience. 

The students mixed talk of J 
homework and hip-hop, exulting 
in the rare experience of being 
together for who they are: smart, 
overachieving and black. Talk of 
race was blatant and honest. 

"I'm the only black male in all 
of my classes," said Taylor Keitt, 
17, a football player at Central 
High School in Philadelphia 
who was counting on scholar-
ships for academics, not athlet-
ics. "It's good to see so many of 
us trying to set ourselves high. 

"There are plenty of qualified 
blacks out there," Taylor added 
with a nod toward the affirma-
tive-action debate. "You don't 
have to lower standards, just go 
and find them."

Report Asks Colleges to Put More 
Re~ources Into Educating Teachers 

As the nation struules to 
train more than 2.5 million new 
teachers over the next decade, 
college and university presi-
dents must pay more attention 
and devote increasing 
resources to their schools ol 
education, a leading higher-
education group argues in an 
unusual report scheduled for 
release Monday. 

The clarion caU by the 
American Council on Education. 
the country's largest asaodation 
of colleges and universities, pre-
sents a harsh critique of the cur-
rent stable of teachers. It says 
that more than half of the 
nation's 7th- through 12th-
graders were recently taught 
physical science by unqualified 
teachers, and that only one in 
five teachers feels prepared to 
integrate technology into the 
classroom. It also expresses con-

cern that elementary school 
teachers, when they were stu-
dents, typically took less chal-
lenging courses and performed 
less well on standardized tests 
than their peers. 

"That many students in 
America - often those most in 
need of excellent teachers - are 
taught by unqualified teachers is 
a reprehensible form of publicly 
sanctioned malpractice,' the 38-
page report says. "Just as no per-
son should receive medical care 
from a person who is not quali-
fied or reliably certified as a 
health care professional, no stu-
dent should face an unqualified 
or uncertified teacher." 

The report, titled ''To Touch 
the Future" proposes that an 
outside agency audit all 1,300 
teacher-education programs in 
the country, oversight that is 
required now for medical and 

law schools. Fewer than half 
these programs receive such 
independent accreditation. 

The report is scheduled to 
land on the desks of the leaders 
of America's 3,500 institutions of 
higher education on Monday. 

The leaders of the nation's 
two largest teachers' unions and 
the head of an association of 
teachers colleges all agreed that 
teacher education has for too 
long been neglected by many 
universities, and they praised 
the report despite its criticism of 
their colleagues. 

"I think what they' re saying 
is that teacher education has not 
been good, and I think they' re 
right," said Sandra Feldman, 
president of the American 
Federation of Teachers.

out students to oppose them. 

However, it is this line of 
thinking that has been applied to 
UCAB. The board is required to 
fund an opposition. Cross said 
the board had difficulty finding 
students passionate enough 
about the expansion to oppose it. 

Vince Vasquez, Revelle fresh-
man senator, came forward to 
head the opposition campaign, 
advocating that students should 
vote against the expansion and 
the "big school feel" it promotes. 

Peterson's . letter also stated 
that, as of Friday, more money 
had been spent by the oppo-
nents of the expansion than on 
pro-expansion materials by 
UCAB. 

In fact, the bulk of materials 
paid for by UCAB are informa-
tive, neither "pro" nor "con," 
Cross said. The board has printed 
only one flier, to be handed out 
this week, that is pro-expansion. 
Most information packets and 
fliers generated by UCAB 
encourage students to vote, 
either for or against the proposed 
$12 million expansion. 

"We just want a definite 'yes' 
or 'no' on this," Cross said. "We 
need 20 percent to vote yes or no 
and we will abide by that." 

The blue flier that states "Vote 
Yes, get more for UCSD," con-
cerned more than one member of 
UCAB. 

Dan Hartmann, the Graduate 
Student Association representa-
tive to UCAB, said that the 
board 's role should be to inform 
students about the proposed 
expansion, not to advocate it. He 
said the flier supporting a "yes" 

vote is "going too far." 
Hartmann was in Europe for 

the past several UCAB meetings 
and only had chance to voice his 
concerns on Friday. 

Doc Khaleghi, the A.S. repre-
sentative to UCAB, said that in 
light of the A.S. resolution criti-
cizing UCAB for playing both 
informer and advocate roles, he 
agreed with Hartmann. 

Peterson's letter stated that 
she would support reviewing 
campus policies, but that UCAB 
is in compliance with current 
ones when it takes on both roles. 

At a Friday town hall meeting 
at Round Table Pizza, students 
discussed their concerns with 
UCAB representatives and a rep-
resentative of the referendum's 
opposition. 

Approximately 40 students 
attended; about a dozen of them 
asked questions. 

Most of the concerns raised by 
students we.re regarding the use 
of the money generated by the 
proposed $25 per quarter 
increase to the student centers 
fee. They said that this week's 
referendum leaves open-ended 
specifics about how the money 
would be spent. 

Also, students said they were 
wary about approving a referen-
dum that would possibly raise 
student fees without further stu-
dent voting. A "yes" vote on the 
proposed expansion would allow 
UCAB to raise the student centers 
fee an additional $5 per quarter, 
every five years, in addition to 
the origina;l $25 increase. 

"I wish I could help answer 
your question, but I, too, have 
been left in the dark about these 
issues," said Vasquez, who is 
heading the anti-expansion cam-
paign.

CANCER: 
Crosses lines of 
gender and ethnicity 
Continued froIII .... 13 

African Americans have the 
highest age-adjusted mortality 
rates from breast cancer of any 
ethnic group. African Americans 
with breast cancer face more than 
twice the risk of dying compared 
with caucasian, primarily because 
they are diagnosed at more 
advanced stages of disease. 
Native Americans have the low-
est mortality rate, but they have 
the worst survival rate once the 
cancer has been detected. 

One may speculate on the rea-
sons for such a high number of 
breast cancer cases in the United 
States, but it is most likely attrib-
uted to the availability of 
advanced health care options. 
Because women in the United 
States tend to be more educated 
on the subject of breast cancer, 
they are more likely to see a doc-
tor, to have a mammogram and to 
be aware of abnormalities. 

BREAST CANCER IN MEN 
Breast cancer is not a selective 

disease. A "Get the Facts" sheet 
estimates that men are usually 
diagnosed at a later stage and are 
less likely to report symptoms. 
This can be due to the fact that 
most people are ignorant to the 
possibility of breast cancer among 
men. 

In 1998, 1600 men were diag-
nosed with breast cancer and 400 
died from it; a 25 percent mortali-
ty rate. All men shQuld be aware 
of the symptoms and should con-
sult their phYSician if concern 
a rises. Signs and symptoms 
include bloody nipple discharge, 
nipple inversion, lumps, pain, 
itching or a pulling sensation. 

PREVENTION 
According to the "Orange 

County Breast Health Resource 
Guide," doctors recommend that 
women begin having clinical 
breast exams at least every three 
years between ages 20 and 40. A 
clinical breast exam includes 
visual examination and feeling of 
the entire breast and underarm 
area for any irregularities. 

On top of receiving examina-
tion by a doctor, women should 
also perform a breast self-exam at 
the same time every month by 
looking at and feeling her breasts 
for any abnormalities. Women 
should check for lumps, hard 
knots or skin that thickens or 

. dimples. 
All women can take precau-

tions beginning at an early age. 
The National Cancer Institute 
(NCl) states that there is an asso-
ciation between a low-fat, high-

fiber diet and low breast cancer 
rates. The NCl advises that 
women exercise regularly and 
drink alcohol in moderation, if at 
all. 

A Komen Foundation pam-
phlet, "Caring for Your Breasts," 
states that in order to increase the 
rate of breast cancer survival; it is 
important that women begin get-
ting annual mammograms begin-
ning at age 40. 

Mammography is an X-ray of 
the breast. Mammography iden-
tifies a site of breast cancer in its 
developmental stages (often two 
years before it is large enough to 
be felt as a lump). The Komen 
Foundation reports that mam-
mography detects approximately 
2-3 times as many "early" breast 
cancers as physical examination 
and is the best way for detecting 
breast cancer. 

A typical mammogram con-
sists of two views of each breast 
in which they are pressed firmly' 
between two plates. The entire 
procedure usually takes a few 
minutes, and is performed by a 
trained technician or radiologist. 
The radiologist will then anafyze 
the X-rays by looking for specific 
abnormalities symbolic of cancer. 

TREATMENT 
There are many treatment 

options available for those who 
are diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Some of the most common treat-
ments, listed in the Orange Coun-
ty Breast Health Resource Guide. 

A lumpectomy is a surgical 
procedure in which the breast 
lump is removed and followed by 
radiation therapy. 

A partial or segmental mastec-
tomy, is the the removal of the 
tumor plus a piece of normal tis-
sue surrounding it, including 
some skin and sometimes the lin-
ing of the chest muscle below the 
tumor. 

A mastectomy is a procedure 
that consists of the removal of the 
breast. Often times, the underarm 
lymph nodes closest to the breast 
are removed to see if the cancer 
has spread beyond the breast. 

Radiation therapy uses high-
energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. 
This type of treatment is often 
used to reduce the size of a cancer 
prior to surgery, or to destroy 
remaining cancer cells after 
surgery. . 

Chemotherapy utilizes drugs 
to destroy cancer cells. 

Hormone therapy consists of 
treating cancer by removing, 
blocking or adding hormones. 

NEW RESEARCH 
Breast cancer is a complicated 

disease, but new research offers 
hope for the more than 182,000 
women that America's Pharma-
ceutical Research Companies 
(APRC) cites will be diagnosed

with breast cancer this year. The 
APRC further reports that with 
over 90 percent of new drugs on 
the mi\,rket, the choice of breast 
cancer medicines is groWing. 

Twelve new prescription 
drugs are available, and over 37 
more are currently being tested. 
APRC affirms that biot~hnology 
researchers are testing medicines 
that would target cancerous 
tumors without damaging any 
healthy tissue. Researchers are 
also studying vitamin A as a 
potential medicine for controlling 
abnormal cell growth, which is 
characteristic of cancer. 

Clinical trials, which are 
research studies conducted with 
people, are currently being con-
ducted at UCSD. These clinical 
trials allow researchers to find 
better ways to prevent and treat 
diseases such as breast cancer. 

According to Finishline's "1999 
Breast Cancer Facts and Figures," 
early detection is key to survival. 
Diagnosed at an early stage, the 
five-year survival rate for women 
is 98 percent. Diagnosed at a 
regional stage, the rate is 78 per-
cent, and for a distant stage, 25 
percent. 

Ultimately, the goal of medical 
researchers, doctors, victims, sur-
vivors and their families is to dis-
cover a cure for breast cancer. 
Until there is a cure, new drugs 
will continue to aid in the treat-
ment of the disease.

ing to find a cure for breast can-
cer. There are many organizations 
who have been working hard in 
order to raise the millions of dol-
lars that are required each year 
for breast cancer research. 

The Komen Foundatic,1l is one 
of the organizations leading the 
fight in the war on breast cancer. 
The Komen Foundation states 
that their mission is "to eradicate 
breast cancer as a life threatening 
disease by advancing research, 
education, screening and treat-
ment." To date, the foundation, 
along with thousands of volun-
teers have raised more than $200 
million for breast cancer 
research. 

The annual Susan G. Komen 
Race for the Cure takes place in 
Newport Beach, Calif. The 
walk/run has become an annual 
tribute to breast cancer survivors 
and lost loved ones. According to 
the Komen Foundation, last 
year's event raised more than $1 
million. 

Twenty-five percent of those 
funds were dedicated to national 
breast cancer research and 75 per-
cent of those funds are providing 
life saving breast health educa-
tion, screening, diagnosis and 
treatment services to women of 
all ages and backgrounds. The 
proceeds also help women who 
would otherwise be unable to 
afford mammograms. 

Many retailers and big-name 
corporations have also joined in 
the fight against breast cancer. In 
1996 the Lee Company estab-
lished a goal of raising $1 mil-

Walt Dlckinl«I/GuarC1ian 

lion for breast cancer research 
and education by instituting the 
first annual Lee National Denim 
Day on which companies all 
around the U.S. allow their 
employees to wear denim to 
work in exchange for contribut-
ing $5 toward breast cancer 
research and education. 

There was such a widespread 
response to the program (over 
3,000 companies signed up to 
participate) that the company 
hoped te raise over $6 million this 
year. The Lee Company has 
helped raise over $10 million dol-
lars in the past three years. 

General Motors and the Coun-
cil of Fashion Designers of Amer-
ica are also making efforts to raise 
funds for research through a pro-
ject known as Concept Cure. Each 
year, top fashion designers from 
around the world create custom 
versions of several General 
Motors cars for the annual Con-
cept Cure National Sweepstakes. 
An of the money that is raised 
from Concept Cure goes towards 
breast cancer research. 

Other efforts such as the Avon 
Worldwide Fund for Women's 
Health and Clinique Breast Can-
cer Awareness programs are also 
widespread campaigns designed 
to provide education as well as 
raise money to support breast 
cancer research.

Late Night Mexican Eateries, San Diego Style 
Rating the risky proposition of midnight dining and Mexican food 
By BETH ARNESE 
Food Critic 

When I suggested that we all 
go to "Roberto's" last Monday 
evening my roommates were 
more than convinced that I'd 
snuck a few beers that day at 
school. But really, there was rea-
soning behind my madness. 

Two things have always 
intrigued me about late-night 
Mexican food. What would the 
food taste like during normal din-
ner hours, without the dulling 
effects of alcohol on my taste-
buds? Would I still find the came 
asada nachos that I'd devoured 
last Friday night to be the single 
most amazing invention of the 
millennium? What about the 
shop's much touted authenticity? 
It is true that the cooks all speak 
Spanish and that some items on 
the menu require a language 
interpreter to understand, but just 
how authentic is the cuisine 
found at these "authentic" Mexi-
can taco shops? 

To me, these are some of life's 
more important questions. I was 
sure that the answers would be 
found in an eclectic sample of 
dishes from Roberto's, Los Dos, 
and EI Cotixan. A dinner-time 
mission to these restaurants 
required a little courage, of 
course, and a little authenticity of 
it's own. Thus, my roommates 
and I split a beer. After all, we 
couldn't violate the number one 
rule in Roberto's dining; the pres-
ence of at least some beer in your 
system. 

Roberto'. 
The crowd: As so many par-

ties these days seem to 
be located somewhere 
off of Governor Drive in 
University City, Rober-
to's attracts all types of 
party animals on the 
typical Friday and Sat-
urday night. 

Of course, to see 
many people at Rober-
to's around 10:30 is a 
sure sign that all of the 
parties have been bro-
ken up by the police. 

On this particular 
Monday night, I found 
that a lack of customers 
made Roberto's obtru-
sive yellow and orange 
decor all the more 
noticeable. There was a 
certain quiet in the air 
that iust whispered of "wrong-
ness. ' My advice: If you believe 
that big crowds mean good food, 
don't go to Roberto's during the 
week. 

The food: I am already con-
vinced that the food at Roberto's 
is authentic in at least one regard: 
the grease factor. Traditional 
Mexican food relies heavily on 
cheese and meat to flavor the 
standard rice and beans. One 
would be foolish to call any Mex-
ican food "healthy," but these 
cheap restaurants seem to deep-
fry everything, even cheese. I 
order the Machaca Burrito 
($2.15), because I think it sounds 
like something that a normal per-
son would never order. Hesitant-
ly, I took a stab into this enor-
mous burrito. I am surprised to 
discover that the Machaca is an 
interesting combination of eggs, 
shredded beef, onions, and chili 

~ 
peppers. Besides the fact that it is 
a little "beefier" than I would pre-
fer, I actually liked it. My friend 
swore that the Roberto's que-
sadilla, though not even on the 
menu, was the best choice. I dis-
agreed, and found the quesadilla 
to be unnecessarily oily. I would 
not recommend it. Still, quesadil-
las are a very authentic Mexican 
dish, and can include everything 
from chorizo (sausage) to animal 
brains (yum). Perhaps this can 
attest for the benefits of an unau-
thentic cuisine. 

How to get there: From cam-
pus, remain on La Jolla Village 
Drive going west as it turns into 
Miramar Road. Tum left at Carl's 
Junior, and you can't miss it. 
Roberto's is open 24 hours.

The crowd: Those who know 

it as "Los Dos" also know that

hangout is a bit more The crowd: Does EI Cotixan

Department provides a strong foundation for students entering the media, journalism and other fields 

ma or . __ .. _-.. 
Issues 

JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

It is said that the communica-
tions. major is one step up from 
undecided. This may be because 
it is very easy and is very com-
mon for a student majoring in 
communications to have no idea 
what he or she wants to do. 

The broad, very vague umbrel-
la that is communications encom-
passes many ideas and categories 
that, at other schools, are consid-
ered entire majors by themselves. 
Media studies, broadcasting, lin-
guistics and more all wear the 
communications hat at UCSD. 

The department states very 
definitively that it does not teach 
the trades of journalism or 
advertising or public relations. 
Many students in UCSD's com-
munications program will say 
that it is very theory-based. 

And so, many communica-
tions students cannot say for cer-
tain what kind of job they will 
get with the degree they are aim-
ing toward. 

While UCSD does not teach 
the trades of broadcasting or of 
public relations, these are the 
types of careers paths communi-
cations students are looking 
toward. A Career Services Center 
survey of 1997 UCSD alumni 
shows that graduates with com-
munications degrees fell into jobs 
in public relations, marketing, 
human relations and customer 
service, among other fields. 

The survey also showed the 
salaries of newly graduated 
communications majors: they 
were just about the lowest, com-
pared to those of the sciences, 
engineering, economics and 
social sciences graduates. 

The survey did not show 
whether 1 ~97 communicat ions 
alumn i were more a ttractjve 
than their sciences and econom-
ics peers . 

The one thing communica-
tions alumni surely brought with 
them to their new jobs is the idea 
that "the man is brainwashing us 
all." At least five courses within 
the major have this as the covert 
theme. 

At least, the "communication 
as a social force" classes do. The 
major is split into three areas that 
are a tad less vague than the 
major itself. In the "social force" 
area, we learn that Rupert Mur-
doch, owner of Fox Networks 
and about six billion other media 
outlets around the world, con-

expertise in other areas. Commu-
nications professors are an eclec-
tic bunch. 

Carol Padden is a deaf profes-
sor who teaches many communi-
cation and mind classes. She 
teaches a class about learning to 
read and the phenomenon of lit-
eracy. She speaks almost so well 
that one wouldn't know that she 
is deaf, and she listens to stu-
dents with the aid of a sign lan-
guage interpreter. 

CAPE evaluations each year 
are not so kind to Yuezhi Zhou, a 
Chinese professor, transplanted 
from Canada, whose heavy 
accent scares many students 
away. However, she is one the 
most learned scholars in the area 
of Asia's media. 

Communications at UCSD, more than a series of 
courses about brainwashing, is a meshing together of 
philosophy, sociology, political science and drama. 
Actually, it began as an inter-disciplinary program, only 
becoming its own department in 1982. As a result, the 
faculty is still made up of professors with expertise in 
other areas. Communications professors are an eclec-
tic bunch. 

trois everything we see and 
think. He's part of "the man" 
we're being brainwashed by. 

Other areas of UCSD commu-
nications study are "communica-
tion and mind" and "communi-
cation and culture." The former 
examines education and the 
development of language - aU 
the tools by which we take on 
identity and by which we are 
brainwashed. The latter looks at 
the ways by which we are brain-
washed: television, socially con-
structed stereotypes and ideolo-
gies. 

Communications at UCSD, 
more than a series of courses 
about brainwashing, is a meshing 
together of philosophy, sociology, 
political science and drama. Actu-
ally, it began as an inter-discipli-
nary program, only becoming its 
own department in 1982. 

As a result, the faculty is still 
made up of professors with 

Also belonging to the depart-
ment, Michael Schudson is one 
of the most well-known authori-
ties on the American news 
media. Schudson also teaches for 
Thurgood Marshall's Dimen-
sions of Culture program. 

Professor Valerie Hartouni 
works out of the communica-
tions department and is also the 
head of the critical gender stud-
ies program. Her classes usually 
focus on the role of women in 
communications and the way 
they are portrayed. 

Professor Rob Horwitz teach-
es a well-known class on law 
related to communication and 
the freedom of expression. He is 
also known for providing several 
pounds of reading materials, are 
all worthwhile and necessary 
reading. 

Many many communications 
classes are well-known for the 
opposite, however.

"I stopped reading third week," 
is a common saying used around 
the time of midterms and finals. 

In the very theory-based curric-
ula of most communications class-
es, it is sometimes easy to decipher 
the main thesis of the class, then 
stop reading and stop attending 
lecture. For papers and mid-terms, 
all one needs do is sometimes 
easy: to decipher the main thesis 
of the class, then stop reading and 
refer back to that thesis. And, in 
many cases, the thesis is that "the 
man is brainwashing us all." 

However, the department does 
have a growing emphasis on 
"practices of production." Stu-
dents are required to gain experi-
ence in creating communication 
of their own, whether that be in a 
news writing course, interning at 
UCSD-Tv, or creating a web site 
in a computers and multimedia. 
communications class. 

These classes are smaller and 
communications students are 
held accountable for their work, 
which may be shocking. 

But the more hands-on classes 
(only one is required in the 
major) give students a better idea 
of career possibilities and a bet-
ter sense of what the theory-
based communications depart-
ment is trying to saY! as a whole. 

The department s goal seems 
to be to examine all aspects of 
communications. 

There are classes on speech 
and the media and television 
and e-mail. There are also classes 
that discuss how people think, 
what they think and the differ-
ences between reading a book 
and reading a billboard. Also, the 
department teaches how those 
media - television, the Internet, 
books, differences between read-
ing a book and reading a bill-
board - shape our ideas as indi-
viduals and as a society. 

Here, again, we are reminded 
of the large umbrella analogy. 

However, for students looking 
toward careers as reporters, broad-
casters, marketing and public rela-
tions specialists, the theoretical 
background a UCSD communica-
tions degree offers is a pretty good 
umbrella to be standing under. 

Bodai proposed a stamp that 
would cost one cent more than 
the regular stamps. Its proceeds 
would go toward research, but 
this idea was quickly rejected by 
the postmaster general. Bodai, 
with the help of new co-sponsor 
Susan Molinari, reintroduced the 
bill in 1997, after making some 
revisions. 

The Act to Stamp out Breast 
Cancer now allows the specially 
designed stamps to be sold at up 
to 8 cents above the normal first-
class postage rate, setting the 
price of the stamps at 40 cents 
each. 

The proceeds, not including 
administration costs will be 
donated to government breast 
cancer research. Seventy percent 
of the funds raised by the sale of 
the stamp will go to the Nation-
al Institutes of Health, and the 
remaining 30 percent will go to 
the Pentagon's Medical 
Research Program. The positive 
response to the new stamp, 
designed by breast cancer sur-
vivor Ethel Kessler, is expected 
to result in proceeds of over $16 
million. 

Since October is the National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 
it is the perfect opportunity to 
start a breast health routine for 
yourself and to urge your loved 
ones to do the same. 

College women should begin 
breast self-examination and begin 
seeing a doctor for clinical breast 
exams. These exams are usually 
provided with gynecological 
exams. 

If you have any questions or 
concerns, the UCSD Women's 
Clinic is located on the second 
floor of the Student Health Center 
on campus. Also, urge your 
mothers, aunts, grandmothers 
and friends to get yearly mam-
mograms along with self-exami-
nation.

sparkle with its 23rd victory of 
the season. 

McFarland sensed that 
upcoming matches will be a good 
test for the Tritons to see if they 
are ready for playoff competition.

"A lot of girls who played

opposed to their regular uni-
forms. The alumni showed up in 
athletic street clothes, but perhaps 
should have thought more seri-
ously about matters as the Tritons 
took them to school by answering 
numerous blocked shots, turning 
them into rallies and sticking 
them down the alumni's throats 
as kills.

with 17 sets, and backed up that 
mark with some additional 
offense of her own, by slamming 
two kills and posting a perfect 
1.00 hitting percentage. Having 
played well on an indi.vidua1 
basis, Kueneman also relied on 
her compatriots Allison' Bender, 
who contributed seven kills, and 
Jennifer McLain, who turned in a 
steady performance with four 
kills in eight attempts. 

"I sense that [the players) are 
anxious to playa tough oppo-
nent," McFarland said in refer-
ence to the upcoming match at 
home versus Cal Poly Pomona 
this Wednesday. "They're real 
strong phYSically. We will get a 
challenge on Wednesday." 

In spite of the admonishment, 
there was no doubt that the 
Tritons had fun at Saturday'S 
alumni game. There was a decent 
turnout in the stands, but more 
importantly, the line of alumni on 
the sidelines was rowdier and 
more populated than an Irish pub 
on St. Patrick's Day. Even Duncan 
McFarland was wearing a happy 
countenance full of smiles and 

laughter before his squad took 
the floor. His team appeared 
loose and ready to enjoy the after-
noon as well. 

The Tritons came out fiery and 
exuberant as they decisively 
defeated the alumni 1~12, 11-2, 
11-1, 11-3. Heckles from both 
sides of the net were exchanged 
in friendly fashion, and the 
Tritons sported what appeared to 
be their practice apparel as 

"I was really happy to see so 
many alumni come out," 
McFarland said. "A· lot of girls 
who played for national champi-
onships were on that team. I 
would expect them to come out 
and play us hard and with a lot of 
will." 

The Tritons will face a strong 
opponent this Wednesday at 7 
p.m., as they host Cal Poly 
Pomona. It should be a close 
match, so come out, bring some 
friends and root on your 
women's volleyball team.

Waves Topple Tritons in Malibu 
WATER POLO: Late foul denies players victory and they falter in over-
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

If the saying is, "C1ose only 
counts in horseshoes, hand 
grenades and water polo," 
everything would be great right 
now. 

Unfortunately, that is not the 
case, and the UCSD Men's Water 
Polo team has to come to terms 
with a gut-wrenching loss to 
Pepperdine last Friday. After the 
smoke cleared, the Tritons had 
lost the game 9·7 in overtime. 

The first three quarters were a 
Jekyll·and-Hyde affair for the 
Tritons. The game started out 
promising as the Tritons jumped 
out to a 2-0 lead after the first 
period. 

The second period wasn't as 
friendly to the Tritons as the 
Waves scored five goals and 
held the Tritons scoreless. 
Waves Michael Hausmann and 
Peter Joseph scored two goals 
each in the second quiltter 
onslaught. 

"We got lackadaisical in the 
second period," Coach Harper 
said. "We like to put pressure 
on the ball and we didn't do 
so." 

In the third quarter the 
Tritons got back to their domi· 
nating ways as they scored three 
goals and held the Waves score-
less. Ross Mecham's goal late in 
the period tied the score at five 
heading into the game's final 
stanza of play. 

With 6:06 left to play, two-
meter man Jonathan Samuels 
scored to give the Tritons the 
lead at 6-5. The lead was short 
lived, however, as HausmaM 

'We are.excited about 
where we are at, but we 
don't want to get too far

gap between the the top 
two or three teams and us

--Denny H."., 
Water Polo Head Coach 

and Sean Hylton scored back to 
back goals to help the Waves 
regain the lead, 7-6. 

With one minute to go in the 
game, Samuels scored his sec-
ond goal of the period to tie the 
game at seven apiece. 

Then with 18 seconds remain-
ing in regulatiort, Mecham 
scored what would have been 
the game-winning goal. 
Unfortunately, the referee called 
a very debatable offensive foul. 
Harper, who waS unhappy with 
the officiating during the game 
in general, was especially upset 
over the call at the end of regula-
tion. 

In overtime, the Triton 
offense was stifled by the 
Pepperdine defense, and the 
Waves' stars stepped up when it 
counted. Hausmann scored his 
fourth goal of the game in the

first overtime period while Peter 
Joseph scored his third goal of 
the game in the second overtime, 
sending the Tritons home with a 
9-7 loss. 

On offense the Tritons were 
led by Mecham, who scored 
three goals, and Samuels, who 
hit the back of the cage twice. 
Vladimir Djapic and Justin 
Wylie each scored once for 
UCSD. 

[n the goal, Glenn Busch kept 
the Tritons in the match, allow-
ing only nine of the Waves' 21 
shots on goal to reach the back of 
his net. 

With the loss, the Tritons 
record goes to 15-7 while their 
win total over Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation teams remains 
at two. 

"We feel we can beat any-
body on any given day," Harper 
said. "The loss was a stinger, but 
we feel we are stepping for-
ward." 

The water polo team is back 
in action next Saturday at 5 
p.m. when it takes on UC Santa 
Barbara at Canyon view pool. 
The Tritons defeated UCSB ear-
lier this season in the NorCal 
Tournament and will be look-
ing to prove the win was nof a 
fluke. 

On Halloween, the Tritons 
take on second-ranked UCLA at 
Canyonview pool. This match 
could serve as a preview of a 
Final-Four matchup that will 
take place later this year. 

The match gets going at noon, 
so make plans to go support the 
Tritons as they try to improve 
upon a season that has already 
exceeded expectations.

WOMEN: 
McManus praises 
hard fought win 

The Tritons' goalkeeper was 
Jennifer Hetland, and despite giv-
ing up one goal, she had four 
saves. UCSC used two goalies with 
Jessica Morgan playing the first 
half and giving up two goals and 
having two assists. Teammate 
Hannah Loeb took over for the sec-
ond half, saviPIg three while bene-
fiting from near misses by UCSD. 

"That was a good game," 
McManus said. "I think we were 

out two or three goals. It was a 
hard win. " The win was also big, 
as it was Homecoming weekend 
and there was a near-capacity 
crowd of 1,162 in attendance. 

"The kids were a little bit nero 
vous," McManus said. "After 
about five minutes they calmed 
down." 

McManus had nothing but 
praise for the Banana 
Slugs."They're a very good team, 
very agile," he said. "That num· 
ber nine [Cunniff] is one of the 
best players in Division Ill. The

A Goose Egg for the Griffins 
SOCKING: Goal-keeping duo of Curtolo and Weinrich figure prominently in 5-0 shutout over Westminster College of Utah 
By ROiERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

With spirits high and scoring 
even higher, the UCSD Men's 
Soccer Team downed 
Westminster College of Utah 5-0 
at home on Friday. The win 
strengthens the Tritons' playoff 
push and lengthens their unbeat-
en streak to nine games. 

"The spirit of the team is high," 
UCSD men's soccer Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. "The opponent 
wasn't as strong, but the spirit of 
the boys was pretty good." 

The Tri tons, who completely 
dominated the game, took 27 shots 
to the Griffins' two. UCSD was 
insurmountable. Goalkeeper 
Lucas Curtolo was 
untouchable. not allow-
ing a goal and only 
being forced to save 
one shot in his 62 
minutes of play. 
Teammate Ryan Weinrich 
also couldn't be scored upon, 
while needing to save only one in 
his 38 minutes of mop-up duty. 

Westminster goalkeeper Steve 
Scoville allowed three goals and

to score their second goal. 

At the 42:17 point. Spencer 
Herbert knocked in a shot from a 
free corner kick by Thompson, 
giving the Tritons a 2-0 lead. 

"I happened to be at the right 
spot at the right time," said 
Herbert, who had a fine evening 
off the bench with a goal and an 
assist. "I was fresh with new legs 
and I got ahead of the guys." 

Just two minutes later, Herbert 
repaid Thompson's generosity. 
Herbert made a pass to the far 
post and Thompson picked it up, 
driving in a kick for the first half 
3-0 advantage. By then, the dam-
age was done and there was no 

chance of a Griffin comeback.

Packer unsuccessfully patrolled 
the first half, allowing two goals 
and saving two. 

With about 10 minutes left, 
dense moisture moved in from 
the ocean and crept across the 
field, encompassing~verything in 
its path. From the sideline at mid-
field, one could not see across the 
field to the sou th goa 1. Luckily for 
all those watching, most of the 
action was taking place at the 
north goal, where there was 
slightly more visibility.

shot was off of a cross from Mike

in for the early 1-0 lead. 

The fog didn't seem to affect the 
Tritons' Tyler Korman. Korman 
accepted a dish from teammate 
Burke Fathy and launched a long-
range shot at the 87:35 mark to seal 
the victory at 5-0.

stands at 11-3-2, and they hope that 
road victories against University 
of San Diego and Cal State San 
Bernardino will seal the deal. 

Coach Armstrong is ambiva-
lent about his team's playoff fate, 
but is hoping that a victory over 
USD will put his team in a good 
position. 

"We're ready to go," Herbert 
said. "We need to settle down and 
move the ball more." 

UCSD next heads into action 
Friday when it ventures across 
town to play USD at 7 p.m. 

"We need to get the word out," 
Armstrong said, referring to the 
paltry crowd on Friday. "We need

UCSD Battles for Win UCSD Slugs Bananas. 
TOUGHNESS: Tritons overcome Chapman and alumni team 

'By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

To start off a weekend, I usually come 
home and enjoy a much-deserved rest, 
lying on my apartment living room sofa 
until I get a call that guides me to the my 
next social and thirst-quenching engage-
ment. 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team, on the other hand, got an 
early afternoon start by 
traveling up to Orange 
County for a match 
against the Chapman 
Panthers. That evening, 
the women were up to their same 
old butt-kicking activities as they 
thwarted those 8-13 cats in three straight 
games 15-4, 15-7, 15-13 to increase their 
overall record to 23-1. 

UCSD then returned home on Saturday 
to face its predecessors on the RIMAC 
court in a series of games versus the alum-
ni team. In this festive exhibition atmos-
phere, UCSD came out in full force and 
presented quite a challenge to the former 
volleyball queens. 

Up in Orange County, however, the cir-
cumstances were a bit more grave and 
competitive. The Tritons displayed good 
control as Chapman came out in the 
beginning of the match looking to rnanu-
facture as rnany points on the scoreboard 
as possible in the face of the Tritons' offen-
sive and defensive prowess. 

"They came out scrapping like we 
expected." Coach Duncan McFarland said 
of Chapman's team. 

Indeed, the Panthers put up a good 
fight as they ended the evening's match 
with a total of 60 digs to the Tritons' 39 
digs. Chapman's unwieldy offense turned 
what would have ordinarily been easily 
won games for UCSD into an interesting 
contest by the second game and a dogfight 
during the third game. If it had not been 
for 14 errors made by the Panthers in the 

last game, the Tritons might actually 
have had to participate in a fourth 

game, which they are not used to 
doing this season. 

The tempo of the 
game was not what 
McFarland and his 

squad would have ideally wished 
for, but UCSD appeared to be in con-

trol for the first two games. In the third 
game, however. the Tritons seemed to fall 
into the dangerous mind-set of compla-
cency as they got down 5-10. but then 
came back to win 15-13. 

Despite falling behind, UCSD had its 
best team attack with 16 kills in the final 
game. 

The Panthers also managed to put on a 
little extra heat with a powerful serving 
game as they compiled eight aces 
throughout the match. 

"They served us tough," McFarland 
said. "They had some good blocks and 
quite a few solo blocks." . 

UCSD was able to counter these mea-
sures with the great play of Cristine 
Kueneman, who has been consistent this 
year in front of the net. She led the team

HOMECOMING: Women's soccer wins before 1,162 fans 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer match 
against UC Santa Cruz on Saturday was 
billed as a big game for the Tritons. A loss 
would hinder UCSD's playoff chances, and 
a win would maintain their momentum 
toward a playoff berth. 

Well. pencil the Tritons in for the 
postseason. 

With a 2-1 victory against 
UCSC on Saturday, the 
Tritons improved ' their 
record to an impressive 13-
1-1. 

"I don't think there is any way 
they can deny us," UCSD women's 
Head Coach Brian McManus said. "It just 
depends on where they put us." 

Prior to the game there was talk of how 
~ UCSC was, who now has a record of 
T5-2. That talk came to.seem like hype. as 
the Tritons were clearly the stronger team 
on the field. 

The Tritons took nearly three times as 
many shots (20 to UCSC's seven) and had 
10 comer kicks, while their opponents 
didn't attempt a single one. Actually, if it 
had not been for a slight lapse in UCSD's 
defense, the game would have been all 
Tritons. 

After 14 minutes of play, it was clear 
that UCSD had come to the field ready to 
dominate. For the most part, the ball 
stayed over on the Banana Slugs' side of 
the field. with constant pressure on the 
UCSC defense. 

Then, out of nowhere, the Banana 

Slugs broke free. Cunniffe dribbled the 
ball up field and passed it to teammate 
Danielle Pellicano, who tipped it in at the 
14:42 mark for a 1-0 lead. This was the first 
goal that UCSD had given up since Sept. 
25, a streak of six straight shutouts that 
tallied an advantage of 37-0. 

Though it was just a goal, it was the 
worst thing the Slugs could have done. for 

then they had to face the wrath of the 
Tritons. 

Less than a minute later, at the 
15:32 point in the game, 
the match was all tied up 
again. The Tritons' Laura 
Dooly accepted a cross 

pass from teammate Erika 
Alfredson and booted the ball in to 

tie the game at 1-1. 
Dooly was not done for the afternoon. 

At the 22:38 mark in the game, she took a 
pass from teammate Lizzy Shilling and 
kicked in her second goal of the game to 
give her team a 2-1 advantage. 

"When we went down, we proved we 
were a team and not individuals," Dooly 
said. "We have a lot of emotion and a lot 
of pride." 

Though the second half was scoreless, 
the Tritons still dominated. 

Shot after shot seemed to be just an 
inch too high, repeatedly ricocheting off 
the crossbar. 

In addition to the two that connected, 
Dooly took four additional shots in the 
game. Teammates Cindy Dostalek and 
Christy Abizaid also each had four shots.
