"George McGovern is a far~ut radical who appeals to those 
who lean toward socialism," said Governor Reagan in a press 
conference last Friday at the University of California Exten-
sion Center in San Francisco. 

"There's no question that both Hubert Humphrey and George 
McGovern present policies leaning toward statism," added the 
governor. 

Asked about his feelings regarding the proposal allowing the 
Regents to lease People's Park to the city of Berkeley, Reagan 
remarked, "I'm waiting to hear the details .. if it were to be an 
appeasement to the street people, I'd have to say no."

'Kosher Nostra' and Tuition': 
ADeal YouCan't Refuse 

Carrie Rickey 

"We're both members of the 
Kosher Nostra, " revealed 
Regent William Coblentz and 
Regent Bob Moretti last Friday 
during a break in the San Fran-
cisco meeting of the UC Board 
of Regents. 

Coblentz explained that he 
and Moretti advocate State 
Senator Walter Stiern's (D-
Bakersfield) rider on the 1972-
73 California budget : a $26.5 
million surplus that would be 
utilized to replace the $100 per 
quarter tuition that UC 
students are obligated to pay. 

The Kosher Nostra pair 
(Coblentz is ,Jewish and 
Moretti is Italian ) estimate 
that the Board of Regents is 
split dow n the middle con-
cerning the acceptance of the 
$26 million "gift" from the 
state legislature. 

Regent Frederick Dutton 
claimed, "During the period 
before the 1960's, the Univer-
sity of California drew from 
upper middle class and middle 
class families of California -
then there was no tuition : but 
during the 1960's when we 
started getting minority 
students, we levied tuition. I

Far-'out Radical" 
The governor voiced his negativism on California Proposition 

Nine and he also conveyed regret regarding Vice-President Ag-
new's possible elimination from the Nixon ticket this fall . 
Questioned as to whom he thought might be Nixon 's running 
mate, Reagan replied , "John Connally," and added , " I admire 
and respect Governor (sic) Connally very much ... he 'd make a 
great Democratic candidate." 

Concerning the Stiern bill that would 21iminate University 
of California tuition, the governor concluded his conference by 
saying, "I think tuition in public higher education is fair as 
long as you don 't deny underprivileged people an education."

labor Committee Interrupts Regents Meeting 
Carrie Rickey 

Immediately following a 
commendation for the UCLA 
basketball team, a group of people 
from the Alameda County Central 
Labor Committee, led by their 
executive secretary Richard Groulx. 
interrupted last Friday 's San 
Francisco meeting of the Board of 
Regents and demanded to be heard. 

Approximately 160 pickets from the 
ACCLC had marched in front of the 
University of California Extension 
Center, where the meeting was held , 
all day Friday. 

Chairman William French Smith of 
the Board of Regents refused to let 
Groulx speak, declaring that his hands 
were proverbially "tied" by the 
Regents' bylaws that do not allow a 
party to address a Board meeting 
without first being on the agenda . 

Groulx continued to interrupt the 
meeting to the point where normal 
business could not be continued . 
Groulx asked Chairman Smith for 15 
minutes in which to address the Board . 
Chairman Smith ordered the meeting 
recessed . 

The ACCLC is a group which 
sponsors the more than 35 academic 

and non-academiC unions that are 
presently on strike at UC Berkeley. 
Groulx claims that he has attempted 
several times to arbitrate the strike, 
but " the Regents refuse to listen ." 

Only one Regent, Frederick Dutton, 
remained in the auditorium during the 
recess. Dutton explained that he felt 
the ACCLC had a right to be heard , He 
stressed the fact that no vote had been 
taken on the recess, and this meant the 
break Smith had called for was 
unauthorized. 

Approximately a half hour later, the 
Regents filed back into the auditorium 
and Smith readjourned the meeting. 
Regent Bob Moretti said : " I have 
never been injured while listening to 
what anybody had to say," and he 
urged the Regents to allow Groulx and 
ACCLC attorney La Mar Childer to 
speak . 

Dutton accused the Regent of 
"handling these people the way we've 
handled UC students we 've 
provoked a confrontation and now 
we 're ignoring them ." He added that 
he felt " there 's alwav been an anti-
union bias in the University ." 

Reagan countered Dutton by stating. 
much to the crowd 's laughter , " I 
suppo e I'm the only nion memb rat 
this table." (Reagan was a member 
and former president of the Screen 

Actor's Guild ) "but I've been on both 
sides of the issue and I feel we 'd be 
establishing a dangerous precedent if 
we let just anyone come over the hip of 
the Board of Regents and speak 
without first being on the agenda ." 

The question of letting ACCLC speak 
was finall y moved, seconded , and 
defeated 17:5. 

The dissenting votes were from 
Coblentz, Dutton. Moretti , Roth and 
Simon. 

Earlier, the Regents heard a 
presentation by the president of the UC 
Alumni As ociation. Regent Chn tian 
Markey, that d alt with activities of 
alumni orgamzations at the various 
campuse . 

UCSD received approval to add a 
new pier to the imltz Marine 
Facility, part of Scripp In tJtutlOn In

the project will largely come from a 
grant of $724 ,000 from the atlOnal

of $80,000 will come from the ScriPPS 
Institution hip replacement account.

Del Mar: a civil disorder Deering -Says 
Carny Sharick 

"Civil disorder " is the way Sheriff's Captain Kenneth 
Deering describes the Mav 12 anti-war demonstration in Del 
Mar Oeering is chief of the Sheriff's Department orthern 
Division. _ 

Once the demonstrator moved onto the track, " felonies of 
conspiracy to block Interstate transport and attempt to block 
interstate tran port were committed," said Deering, and the 
police "were required to take actions and make arrests ." 

"The Sheriff's Department is required bv law to take action 
In situations such as the Del Mar demonstration." said 
Deering . " In fact. according to a Los Angeles court decision. 
the henff's Department i liable for damage to per ons and 
private property if they do not move or if the,v delay too long in 
moving into a situation. " 

The objective of the police action, Deering said, wa to 
"break up the mass of people into small groups. When people 
act as a mass, the potential for injury and damage goes up." 

Deenng said, "215 law enforcement officers were on hand at 
the demonstration along with support people." Support people 
were described as members of the police academy, some of 
which were "operating in an undercover capacity." Other 
agencies, uch as the District Attornev 's Office were on hand 
also, Deering stated. . 

" We wanted to let people know that ther~ was adequate law 
enforcement available," Deering said, "and that they should 
behave themselves." 

The function of the roadblocks which "sealed off the city" 
wereto " keep more people from coming in (to Del Mar) a'nd 
~reatIng a traffic jam, " said Deering. The roadblocks were 
Initially established after police moved demonstrators to 15th 
street and into the 101 intersection. 

Deering said that police moved into the situation from the 
north access route and that the only exit route for the demon-
strators was to the east. into the Intersection, and the business 
district. 

Del Mar City Councilman Tom Shepard and City Manager 
Jack Shelver met with Deering the afternoon of the incident to 

dlscu s the approach the Sheriff's Department would take if 
the gathering proved disorderly or disruptive . 

According to Shepard, Captain Deering agreed to the "city's 
posture" at the time of the discussion. but did not follow it 
during the actual incident. According to Shepard, the 
agreements were : 

I. That officers not move into the area until there wa a 
violation of the law. 

2. That the demonstrators would have time to disperse after 
police gave the order to leave the area before any arrest were 
made. 

3. That the demonstrato'rs not be disper ed into the beach 
area . 

4. That the 
business area . 

demon trator not be disper ed into the 

According to Shepard, breeche of the agreement were : 
I. More than 100 police officer moved into the area of 18th 

and Coast well before any persons were on the railroad track . 
2. The city wanted to give the demonstrators 10 minute to 

disperse. Deering suggested three minutes . The officers 
moved in and made arrests while the order for di persal was 
still being read. Arrests totaled 39. 

3. Demonstrators were dispersed into the beach area 
4. Demonstrators were dispersed into the busine s area . The 

fact that no vandalism occured i attributed to the 
"Responsibility of the demonstrators," according to Shepard . 

Captain Deering 's response to the charges were : 
I. The agreement was not to move into the area until a crime 

was committed. Officers were readv near-by but did not enter 
the immediate area until the felonie ' of conspiracy, attempt to 
block interstate transport, and arson were committed. 

2. The initial arrests were for felonies committed, not for 
unlawful assembly , There was adequate time for the 
demonstrators who wanted to leave to leave. 

3. The agreement not to disperse the demon trator into the 
beach or business areas was not understood. Deering said, 
"This was a breakdown in communications. we were talking, 

North County Police Chief Kenneth Deering 
but not commumcating " 

City CCMlncii Allegations 
City Manager Jack helver said tht t fire truck which came 

to exlingui h the railroad tie could n)t respond directly to th 
fire becau e Sheriff' deputies blockeo acce road . 

"That's a lot of malarky," said Deering. "Th 
demon trator were blockih th~ nuw vi ll .. ffi~ cll lI, iOl

Mayor Tom Pearson and City manager Jack Mtvpr Will

Breezy June 1-35 
The Selective Service System announced today that all 

eligible men with lottery numbers 1 through 35 who have not 
already been issued induction orders for April or May will be 
issued orders with June reporting dates. In mid-March. the 
draft headquarters had announced that 1972 prime induction 
candidates with lottery numbers 1 through 15 would be issued 
induction orders with April-May reporting dates and that the 
lottery number would be raised in early May in order to 
provide adequate men for June inductions. 

The new instruction by Acting Director Byron Pepitone to 
state headquarters and local boards primarily affects men who 
are members of the 1972 First Priority Selection Group. which 
is composed of registrants in Classes I-A and I-A-O who were 
born in 1952. A small number of older men also will be issued 
orders for June inductions. These are men who recently have 
lost deferments or whose initial postponements of induction 
expire in June. 

Attention All Seniors 
Many graduating students have expressed great concern that 

in these times of international crises they are asked to give 
money for senior gifts and caps and gowns rather than to areas 
in desperate need of funds . Only eight seniors at Muir con-
tributed to the MUir class gift fund . and one of these designated 
that the money must be specifically used for anti-war 
purposes. Because of the obvIOus lack of interest in traditional 
aspects of receiving degrees from the University. a meaningful 
alternative has been set up . 

Instead of paying five dollars for the rental of caps and 
gowns. students are urged to donate that five dollars to more 
necessary causes of their choosing. At the graduation 
ceremony It wlll be noted that a number of students have 
chosen to contribute the money otherwise spent on caps and 
gowns to more worthwhile causes. The various concerns to 
which contributIOns are made will be- noted at that time. 
Suggested areas of dona lion might Include various war relief 
funds . legal defense funds . the EOP high school tutorial pro-
gram. Pepper Canyon School. various ecology projects. 
UN ICEF. AFT. the Air War Initiative. political candidates . 
charitable humanitarian organizations or WHATEVER the 
student deSignates. 

Senior representatives have contacted the Amencan Friends 
Service Committee which offers relief all over the world . 
currently emphasiZing aid in Bangladesh and Vietnam The 
Friends committee is gratful that UCSD students realize the 
priority that human suffering takes over near-empty traditions 
today. they thanked the students for thinking along these lines 
and said that donations may be earmarked for any par t of the 
world . though the organization always concentrates its work in 
areas of the most immediate necessit.,. . 

Collection poi nts for your donations are the Revelle Sundry 
Store and the Muir College Dean 's Office. . 

Checks may be made out to Dean Jim Rpckley.

Female Literature Prof 
Files Charges Aga; nsf UC 

Dr. Dagmar Barnouw of the Department of Literature has 
filed formal complaints against the University of California. 
San Diego. with both the State Fair Employment Practices 
Commission and the Department of Health. Education . and 
Welfare of the Federal Government. She has charged the 
University with sex discrimination in violatien of Executive 
Order 11246. amended by Executive Order 11375. on the 
grounds that her original appointment. recommended by the 
Department of Li terature in 1971 . as assistant professor step 
III. was changed to a one-year lectureship, and that even this 
appointment was in 1972 discontinued. She has asked for 
reappointment at an appropriate assistant professor level and 
compensation through payment of adjusted back wages . 

Dr. Barnouw. a 1968 Ph.D. in German literature from Yale 
University . came to UCSD in 1969 with her husba nd . who had 
been appointed to the Department of Li teralure Before 
coming she had received written and verbal assurances that a 
position in her field was soon to open uP. which she would in all 
probability be able to occupy. In the meantime. she (as is 
often the case with Qualified faculty wives ) was given a few 
courses as a part-time lecturer in the department. When a 
poSition finally did open up for 1971 -72. a series of 
developments occurred which allegedly revealed discrimina-
tion against her as a woman and as a facully wife. 

The Department of Literature in the spring of 1971 voted to 
offer her a position as assistant professor step III . But when

An exhibition of paintings by 
UCSD graduate student Jack 
Pressler will be on display in 
the Art Gallery Sunday-Friday, 
May 21-26. 

The exhibit, which is free and 
open to the public, is one in a 
series of shows being given 
weekly through the first week 
of June by visual arts graduate 
students as part of their Master 
of Fine Arts requirements. The 
gallery is located on the first 
floor of the Humanities-
Library Bldg. on the Revelle 
Colleg£: campus, and is open 
from 11 a .m. to 3 p.m., daily. 

Pre ssler de scribes hi s 
drawings and paintings as 
basica lly linear. He is involved 
in developing wa ys of 
controlling lines to achieve 
various senses of flow, tension, 
weightlessness , and 
complexity. Sometimes he uses 
the actual shape of islands 
traced from maps to crea te his 
paintings. Other times he has 
prepared the surface of his 
paintings to create map-like 
obstacles for the straight lines 
in the pictu re. 

Pressler is a graduate of the 
Art Institute of Chicago. lie has 
ex hibi ted many works in a 
student cooperative art ga llery 
on G Street in San Diego. 

Char, Sounds I 
and Wapes 

A premiere performance of 
computer music by U mversity 
of Ca lifornia. San Diego 
graduate student composers 
will be presented thiS Fflday at 
8:30 p.m. 

The concert, to be held in the 
Recital Hall , Bldg. 409 on the 

' Matthews Cam pu s . will 
explore the po sibilities of 
usi ng ('omputers as 
Instruments . both by 
t hemselves , and in 
combination with conventional 
In truments . The concert IS 
free and open to the public. 

Among works to be 
performed is "Chor " by 
Stanford Evans and featur ing a 
bass soloist. Joseph Julian . also 
a graduate student composer. 
will perform as soloist. 

Evan s is an inventive 
percuss ion performer and has 
composed many works for 
percussion instruments and 
computers. He is presently 
working on his master's degree 
in mathematical linguistics. 

Also on the program is 
"Sounds I ," a computer-
assisted composition for two 
pianos by Bruce Leibig . 
Written in 1969, it was the first 
computer-written piece in the 
Southwest. Leibig's piece, 
"Wapes," a work for computer 
tape and featuring several 
unique software modules 
developed for the piece, will 
also be performed . 

Leibig has a bachelor'S 
degree in music from North 
Texas State University and 
attended the Stanford 
Computer Music Workshop in 
1971. He is working on his 
master 's degree and installed 
the Music V computer-sound 
synthesis system at UCSD . 

The program will be 
concluded by "Quantat," a 
work for four channels of 
computer-generated sound and 
live electronics crea ted by 
John Mizelle. 

Mi ze lle's many compositions 
have been performed on both 
the East and West Coasts. Hi s 
works are often publi shed in 
the music magazine. " Source 
Mus~c of the Avant-Garde ." 

Choreographed 
reading 
"Facade." one of the first 

modern multi-media works 
eve r presen ted. will be 
performed at 8 p.m. tomorrow 
in the UCSD Theater located on 
Matthews Campus. 

The original version , fir t 
presented in 1924, consisted of 
a series of poems by Edith 
Sitwell with or ches tral 
accompaniment composed by 
William Walton . The UCSD 
performance , staged and 
produced by speech and drama 
tudents from San Diego State 

College, replaces Walton's 
music with dances which 
In te rpret Edith Sitwell 's 
bizarre poems. 

The produ cti on will be 
directed by Mrs. Margaret 
Thornburgh , a graduate 
student at SDSC, as part of her 
master's thesis. It is a 
"choreographed reading" with 
a great deal of movement. The 
cast consists of eight 
reader /dancers , including Mrs . 
Thornborgh . who will interpret 
21 of Miss Sitwell's poems. 

Despite the change from 

music to dance , the special 
" Twenties" style of the work -
mannered , precious , 
extravagant has been 
retained . 
The performance is free and 

open to the public.

Occasionally while writing 
up the Possibilities, we find a 
real zonker amongst the press 
releases. The hype : The 
Dillards, "country - bluegrass -
comedy - at its best! " are 
playing this weekend at an 
Escondido coffee shop called In

been a depository for their 
flyers all this year - just look 
on any bulletin board to get the

in the TT? We kind of like In 
the Alley - not too bad for 
what you'd expect musically in 
a town located between 
Oceanside and Julian. 

In fact, you might consider 
going there to help a small 
single - proprietor place get off 
to a good start. Of course, 
they 're already on quite a rise 
in popularity for the local 
would -be high school freaks. 
Recently, they got enough

just because they've enough

last summer wiLh the National 
Shakespeare Festival. 

Students through college may 
purchase reduced priced 
tickets for '2 .75 for all 
performances except Saturday 
evening for "Beyond the 
Fringe." 

Proposition 9: an evaluation 
William H. Stoddard 

This act s'.rikes me as fairly 
typical of the American 
political process : some 
excellent provisions, some that 
are ultimately undesirable but 
presently may be necessary, 
some that are unimportant, 
some that are simply bad , all in 
one inseparable jumble. I 
suppose the responses will 
mostly be either fanatically 
positive or fanatically 
negative ; some people think 
ecology is God 's greatest 
revelation, some that it's all a 
com munist plot against 
American industry, hardly any 
that it's simply a problem of 
law and technology whose 
solution is more obstructed by 
making it a crusade , than 
speeded up . 

The sections dealing with 
gasoline lead content and 
octane number and related 
features fall into category two : 
bad in underlying principle, but 
the best that can be expected. 
As long as the government 
owns most of the main roads, 
there 's little chance of bringing 
suit against the road owners to 
keep polluting drivers off ; so 
limiting amounts of lead is a 
tolerable short-run method -
lead is, after all , a poison, and 
it doesn 't seem very good for 
people to be releasing poisons 
into the air . I would prefer :1 
provision for class-action suits 
against use of such gasolines in 
given areas (there are a lot of 
people who'd be glad to bring 
them ; for example, the PlRG 
here ), but in the present 
context this may be the best 
we'll get. 

Features AmbiCuous 
The features expanding the 

power of the State Air 
Resources Board are also 
ambiguous . The provIsion 
allowing su it for recovery of 
harm resulting from pollution 
is something we should have 
had a long time ago . (Such 
methods were sometimes used 
in the la te 1800's, but it was 
decided by the government that 
pollution was in the public 
interest, so businesses were 
granted an aritificial 
immunity .) I don't like giving a 
state age ncy control over 
pollution ; such agencies either 
do too much to the peo:Jle 
who aren't causing harm, or let 
off the real polluters !Ralph 
Nader has attacked the 
alliance of the CAB and the 

airlines; but in every regultory 
agency develops a network of 
such arrangements), or both . 
Also, the act gives too much 
arbitrary power to the 
executive branch ; anyone 
who 's at all involved with the 
head subculture knows how 

much this power can be used 
for harassment and 
intimidation. (Pharmaceutical 
companies are continually 
harassed in just this way ; an 
important result is that 
research is cut down .) I would 
prefer that the initiative be left 
with private individuals in 
standard and class-action civil-
suits ; if pollution cannot be 
shown to have damaged any 
person or property, then it 
should not be attacked , and I 
would rather see the courts 
decide . [ am not in love with 
the present monopoly court 
system, bu t it's much less 
subject to bias than are 
government agencies in 
general. This section is in 
many ways a detriment. 

The class action proceedings 
whic~arelegitimized by this act 
are one of its best features. We 
need antipollution measures ; 
but they should be tied to actual 
damage. Class actions allow 
this to be done even when no 
individual is severely 
damaged . 

The procedure for fining 
polluters is neutral ; nor 
IJltimately ~ood (why should 

the state collect the money? ), 
but probably useful. 

The opening of records on 
actions of the pollution control 
boards, and the proceedings 
barring conflicts of interests, 
are essentially good, being 
guards against one of the worst

dangers - the government 
taking advantage of a real 
danger to seize excessive 
power. 

The procedures limiting oil 
exploitation are not ultimately 
desirable (there should be less 
monolithic ways to save the 
beaches Lhan a wholesale ban ), 
but in the present context 
they 're probably useful. 

Flaws iD Nuclear Power 
The restriction on nuclear 

power is sheerly id ioUc. I know 
of three main flaws in nuclear 
power : heat pollution, waste 
disposal , and explosion risk . Of 
these, explosion is ridiculously 
unlikely ; both theory and 
experiement indicate that 
nuclear power plants will not 
explode . Heat pollution is 
not unique to nuclear power ; 
and it seems to me that it 
might better be handled by 
private, class action, or 
governmental suits on 
demonstration of ecological 
damage . In any case, heat 
pollution is inescapable in any 
industrial society, which ours 
must be in order to avoid 

famine. Nuclear power planLs 
are likely to be more efficient 
and thus to cause less heat 
pollution ; in particular, fines 
and civil suits for it could 
encourage them to find 
techniques for USing the excess 
heat, while shutdown will cut 
off research on this highly 
promising technology. uclear 
wastes are damaging, but so 
are coal and oil wastes, which 
many plants now relea se ; and 
it takes a lot more oil to 
produce the same amount of 
power. Anyone who looks at the 
air over a combustion-based 
plant and then over a nuclear 
plant can see the difference . 
We can survive the death of 
fish better than the spread of 
smog; and the death of fish, as 
I have suggested above, could 
be eliminated , without 
governmental prohibitory 
legislation . 

The outlawing of DDT and 
related compounds, again , is 
bad in ultimate principle (!feel 
this way about outlawing 
anyth ing; I would happily 
goentirely by civil damage 
suits, abandoning all legislation 
setting up criminal penalties I. 
but immediately beneficial. 

The features allowing suit for 
ecological damage are all, in 
my jUdgement, good. . 

Seeing the arguments for and 
against, I have to concede that 
there is some justice on both 
sides. I think I shall probably 
vote against , but with the hope 
of seeing new proposals 
establishing those parts of it 
which are beneficial. I may 
change my mind . I think it 
unfortunate that all of those 
acts have been lumped 
together ; such decisions should 
be presented in ways letting 
them be considered 
individually . It 's a risky 
business at the very best to 
make decisions for a whole 
society, including people whom 
you've never seen and many 
who aren't yet born this act 
gives the impression of having 
been written by peop Ie in a 
mood of sheer panic, which is 
hardly suited to getting 
intelligent decisions made. 
Admittedly, there 's some 
cause for panic ; but I feel 
much more panicked by seeing 
legislation this badly worked 
out put up for vote - and see 
less way to do anything about 
it .

Vietnam 
Editor : 

We. as students, find ourse lve faced with three choices : 
I. Pledge lull support to Nixon's esca lation of the Vietnam 

war . 
2. Continued dissent as in the past via demonstrations and 

marches. 
3. Escalation of dissent mak ing it impossible for the U.S. 

Government to continue military actions in Vietnam . 
If we choose the first decision. we are giving our tacit 

support for continued American aggression In Southeast ASia 
and other parts of the world . 

If we choose the second , we will simply be continuing along 
the same dead-end road. American intervention in Vietnam 
has not subsided as wa prophesized , but rather escalated. At 
the barga ining table , the Admini tration has continued in its 
outrageous demands and has refused recognition of the BPRG 
Peace Plan. 

Ilence. what looked to us before a three choices , clearly 
boils down to one. So I Wi sh. at this time, to affect the following 
actions : 

I . That all ways of entry to the Pentagon, Wh ite House, tate 
capitols. city hall s and any other government building be 
blockaded . 

2. All rail. water and air transportation 01 military 
armaments to Vielnam be discontinued. 

These actions will cease when the Administration formally 
announced to the world that its intervention inVletnam has 
been irresponsible. immoral and imperialistic : and that thiS 
intervention will cease with the reduction of all U .S. troops and 
military advisors from Southeast Asia within one month 's 
lime . Also. a pledge by the United tales of economic 
assistance to the people of Vietnam in rebuildmg the nation 
which it has destroyed. Also. the resignallon of President 
:'Iixon and a relurn of U.S. Government to the American 
People.
