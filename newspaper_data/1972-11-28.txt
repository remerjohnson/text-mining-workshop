Rad ical Coalition 
Demands 

To Chancellor William D. 
McElroy 

We request a written 
response to the following 
d mands : 

1. That you, in your of-
ficial capaci ty as Chan-
cellor, make a statement 
condemning the action of 
the administration in 
authorizing the presence, 
and therefore, the actions, 
of police on the Southern 
Universi ty campus. 

2. That you condemn the 
use of fo ce in repressing 
student struggle for se lf-
determination . Self-deter-
minatio n means here a 
more than advisory capacity 
in university administrative 
and policy-making func-
tions of the university by 
students, faculty, and staff. 

3. That you inform us, in 
detail, at what point and 
under what conditions you 
will deem it necessary to 
bring heriffs, tate police, 
or National Guard on this 

campus, particularly in 
response to student 
struggle for self-determina-
tion . 

4. That you work to make 
publicly available and well -
known the term s and 
sou rces of all classified and 
unclassified funding direct-
ly or indirectly administer-
ed by UCSD (including 
funding for 510, NEL, 
Visibility Lab, and Marine 
Physical Lab). 

5. That you, as ad-
ministrator, work to halt all 
classified research that is 
directly or indirectly 
funded, supported, and ad-
ministrated by UCSD -
specifically, research done 
at 10, EL, Visibility Lab, 
and Marin Ph ical Lab. 

We requ es t that your 
respons arc availabl to 
u by onday, ovember 
27, 1972.

Chancellor's 
Response 

I am writing in response 
to the five " demands" we 
discussed last Tuesday and 
which you formally pre-
se nted to me later that 
same afternoon. 

1. I have already ex-
pressed my feelings about 
the tragedy at Southern 
University and I await the 
findings of both of the 
current inquiries into the 
shootings. I condemn vio-
lence on a university cam-
pus, whoever its perpetra-
tors. 

2. I do not subscribe to 
the notion of university 
governance by committee 
whether dominated by stu-
dents, faculty members or 
staff. I believe such a con-
cept to b impractical and, 
in my exp rience, un-
workable. And I think it 
b lies a simplistic under-
standing of the sources of 
power in a univer ity set-
ting. But I am just as cer tain 
that forc has no prop r 
role in the governance of a 
university. I would expect 
to resort to it~ use on Iv 
when other~, by their OV\. n 
ilCtions a saulting the 
Untverslty, leave me With 
no alternative 

I cannot detail ev ry con-
ceivable circumstance that 
might prompt me to seek 
the assistance of of[ 
campus police to resolve an 
on-campus problem. I can, 
however, generalize that 
any situation posing a direct 
threat to the safety of per-
sons at UCSD which we 
could not handle ourselves 
would oblige me to call 
upon outside aid . 

4. The terms and sources 
of all funding directly or in-
directly administered by 
UCSD are public matters 
already available to and 
known by all who wish to 
have that data. I will work 
to mainain that openness. 

5. I am committed to the 
belief that classified re-
search has no place on a 
university campus and I will 
continue to work to realize 
that objective. I V\.ill not, 
howev r, extend that con-
viction to individual faculty 
members, students or staff 
In what they may choose to 
do off the campus. That 
pll,rt Ion i, propprlv their 
own.

economist" and as erted that he "has effectively 
shatter d many of the most c:hensheci belief, of the 
maJorltv of hi colleagues." All articl In Time magdlinp 
two year~ ago contained Frledrn<ln' de crlption of the 
way his ideas are usually recpived . At first, he says hi' 
colleagues Me of the opinion that "the views of 
crackpots like myself are to be avoided," Then people 
"b come uncomfortable becau e the ideas seem to 
have an element of truth"; eventually other people 
adopt his views and "convert my ideas into untenable 
caricature so that they can move over and occup the 
ground where I formerly stood." 

Among the ideas which have engendered energetic 
and heated response is his ass rtion that the govern-
ment is pur uing an entir Iy wrong cour e when it seeks 
to control inflation and recession by means of changes 
in federal pending and taxation level . Friedman ha 
suggested that the money supply b increa ed at a rate 
of 3.5 to 5 per cent annually to urb infla tion and 
recession. Friedman ha al 0 propo ed a "negative 
income tax"as an alternate guaranteed income plan to 
the present welfare system. 

Friedman 's interest extend far beyond the phere of 
onomic . It has been tated that the core of hi 

philo ophy i a firm belief in th value of individual 
freedom. Thi is reflect d in his a sertion many year 
ago that the draft - in hi view an example of 
unwarranted compulsion - should be abandon d in 
favor of an all vo lunteer arm , In the ~phere of 
education, Friedman ha propo ed setting up a y tem 
which wou ld provide par nts with voucher that would 
pay for tuition at any chool, thu for ing poorer 
s hools to improve or close down. Friedman has al 0 
b n 10 ely a sodated with politi s, acting a chief 
conomic advisor to Barry Goldwater in 1964 and later 

as prinCipal economic advi or to Ri hard ixon . 

Friedman has been de ribed a an intere ting and 
amu ing lectur r with a penchant for argument and 
debat and a t nden y to over tate hi view in ord r to 
giv p opl a jolt and g t them to Ii t n . Thi estimation 
is upported by th iz of the audienc for hi Ie tur 
at th Univ r ity of hi ago, which normall draw a 
hundr d who are not enroll d in th

SU: In Memoriam 
Rick Drom 

Las: Tuesday UCSD commemorated the two studC'n ts 
who WN killed at Southern Unlvprsltv With d noon 
assembly, an extended lunch hour, ano <l (ancellation 
of all dasses between 1 and 2 p m 

In a Ipller prtnted in th TRITO TIMES, Chancellor 
McElroy cancelled classes for studpnts and extendpd 
the lunch hour for employees from 1 untt! 2 p.m These 
actions were done in m mory of the two students who 
were killed on ov. 16 at outhern University in 
LOUisiana during a demonstration McElroy also asked 
that instructors permit a student to make up any work 
that he may have missed on Tu sday due to the tragedy 

At noon about 400 people gathered on the Muir 
om mons lawn to listen to speeches concerning the 
deat~. of the students. Willard Hall , aSSIStant to the 
reSident dean at Muir, introduced each of the speakers, 
beginning with Joe Watson, provost at Third College, 

Watson said that the death of the two black students 
showed that black people were stili not recognized a~ 
people In the U, . liThe crtllcal point," he said, "is for us 
to all rededicate oursplves on this campus and across 
the nation to meet thp nC'eds of our peoplp."

AFT Attacks Orr 
The American Federation of Teachers at the Universi-

ty of California charged that State Finance Director 
Verne Orr's latest attack on the University of California 
at the November Regents' meeting represents the latest 
installment in Governor Reagan 's demagogic assault on 
the University of California. 

Mr. Orr singled out a few high sa laries for criticism, 
but he neglected to mention that the overwhelming 
majority of UC academic employees have suffered a 
decline in real income since 1969 as a result of the 
Reagan policies. The recent recommendation by the 
Regents for a 5.4 percent pay increase falls about 6 
percent short of restoring the purchasing power of UC 
academic employees to the 1969 level. In addition, 
fringe benefits at the University of California are 
currently almost 6 percent below fringe benefits at 
compa rable institutions, and the University is proposing 
only a modest 3.3 percent increase in fringes for next 
year. Moreover, the University of California inflicted a 
10-week strike on the Berkeley campus because it 
refuses to pay prevailing wages for construction 
workers. 

Mr. Orr also failed to mention that there is a substan-
tial surplus of almost $600 million in Sacramento this 
yea r, so that there is no fiscal reason for denying th 
University adequate budgetary support . Orr also at-
tacked the University for inaccurately estimating enroll-
ment projections in recent years. Paul Goodmaf), Presi-
dent of Univers ity Council-AFT, charged that recent 
sharp declines in enrollment were largely due to the 
imposition of tuition at the University by Governor 
Reagan which has made it impossible for thousands of 
otherwise qualified student to attend whom the 
University expected to register. "Failure by the Reagan 
administration to provide financial assistance fo r 
quali fied needy students has Increasingly turned UC 
Into an imtitution to which only the most affluent 
students have access," Goodman charged. " Yet Gover-
nor Reagan promised, when he imposed tUition, that 
no qualified student would be turned away for financial 
reasons." Professor Goodman added that, "Ca lifornia is 
lagging far behind many other states in providing 
financial assistance." 

Salute to 
Black Women 

The University of California, San Di<c'go Black Drama 
Association, under the direction of Dr. Charles Bettis,

TV Religion 
"Television - The New Religion" by Dr . George 

Gerbner, Dean of the Annenberg School of Com-
munications, is scheduled as the opening lecture in a 
new se ri es featuring noted authorities in com-
munications theory and ana lysis and sponsored by the 
Third College Communications Program, University o f 
California, San D iego. 

The lecture will be held at B p.m. Wednesday, 
December 6, in the Lecture Hall, Bldg. 201 on the 
Matthews Campus. The series is free and open to the 
public. 

"Dr. Gerbner's topic should be of special interest to 
teachers, religious p rsonnel and all those interested in 
mass media," said Prof. Mike Real , UCSD Com-
munications Program Coordinator . 
. The Annenberg School of Communications, located 

at the University of Pennsylvania, is one of the noted 
commu nications schools in the United States . 

A native of Hungary, Prof. Gerbner became a U.S. 
citizen just before World War II and served as a 
paratrooper and editor for the U.S. Army during the 
war. He worked in professional communications in 
Hungary and the U.S . for the " San Francisco 
Chronicle," for the U.S. Information Service, and as a 
free-lance writer. 

Gerbner received his doctorate from the University 
of Southern California . He served as a research 
professor at the Institute of Communications Research 
at the University of Illinois for eight years before his 
appointment at the Annenberg School. 

Prof. Gerbner's re arch interests have included 
cross-culture studies of films and education, the effects 
of the portrayal of violence on television, American 
popular culture, public conceptions of mental illness, 
and theories of communica tion. 

Recent articles by Dr. Gerbner have appeared in 
"Communications" (Paris), " The Annal s of the 
American Academy of Political and Social cience," and 
"Scien tific American." His latest book, "Com-
munications Technology and Social Policy," will soon 
be published by John Wiley and Sons. 

Other speakers in the series will includ international 
specialists in the social, political, economic, personal 
and theoretical dimensions of the social process of 
communications, and will be scheduled throughout the 
sp ring. 

Newsmakers to Lecture 
Four newsmakers - men who have figured in both 

national and world events over the past severa l years-
have been selected to give the 1972-73 Mandeville 
lectures present d by the University of California, San 
Diego. 

The sp akers are Dr. Milton Friedman, Distinguished 
Service Professor of Economics at the University of 

This season's lectures, all free and open to the public, 
will begin with Dr. Friedman at 8:00 p.m. Thursday, 
Novembcr 30, in Sherwood Hall, 700 Prospect Street, La 
Jolla . The three remai ning lectures will be held in the 
Casa del Prado in Balboa Pa rk. Prime Minister Wil son is 
scheduled to speak on January 9, Jack Anderson is 
scheduled January 12, and Sir Bernard Lovell is 
scheduled to conclude the series on February 15. 

Friedman, in addition to serving as the Pau l Snowden 
Russe ll Distinguished Service Professo r of Economics at 
the University of Chicago, is a member of the research 
staff of the National Burea u of Eco nomic Resea rch, and 
a columnist and cont ributing editor for Newsweek 
magazine. 

He received an A.B. degree from Rutgers University 
in 1932 and continued with graduate work at the 
University of Chicago and Columbia University, 
rcceiving a Ph .D. in economics from Columbia in 1946. 
He served as Associate Professor of Economics and 
Business Administration at the University of Minnesota 
before joining the faculty of the University of Chicago 
as Associate Professo r of Economics in 1946. 

Friedman is considered one of the most outspoken, 
provacative, and inventive thinkers in the fi eld of 
economics in the United States today. Through his 
d octr ines, known as Friedmanism, he has engaged in a 
major assault upon the Federal Reserve System arguing 
that the government has blundered by tinkering with 
interest rates in order to stabilize the economy. 

It is Fri edman's contention that the Federal Reserve 
System should conce ntrate on regulating the quantity 
of money itself and let the interest rates fall where they 
may. 

Included among h is more controversial th eories is a 
now celebrated plan for a negative income tax which 
would put money into the hands of the poor without 
having to pass through a labyrinthine welfa re apparatus. 

Friedman's book, "A Monetary History of the United 
States, 1B67-1960," which he wrote with Dr. Anna 

chwartz, is now recognized as a classic in the lit rature 
of economics.

TH I S map of the U.S. shows What the impact of the war in Vietnam would have been had it 
ta ken pla ce in the U.S. Casualty, refugee, and defoliation data for the U.S. were 
comput ed on a percentage basis to reflect actual data from South Vietnam. Calculations 
took into consideration the ratios of U.S. to South Vietnamese populations and land 
areas. The statistics were then converted to state populations (or land areas) and 
prOjected on the map. Sources for the data are the U.S. Department of Defense, the 
Se nate Subcommittee on Refu~ees, the Republic of Vietnam Ministry of Information. and 
the Stanford Biology Group (on defol tation). 

if it had happened here • • • 
Statistics on war have a way of 

sou nding like just so man y 
numbers. The map above was 
designed to help Americans un-
derstand the magnitude of the I n-
dochina War by showing what 
would have happened had an 
amount of damage equivalent Il) 
that done in the south of Vietnam 
been inflicted on the United tales. 

Figures from the sou th rather 
than eithe r the north, Laos, or 
Cambodia were used for all projec-
tion\ because of the greater 
availability of data and because it is 
the country the U.S. ostensibly et 
out to protect. 

The ratio of the south Viet-
namese population to that of the 
U .. is about 1:11 .3, so for every 
<out h Vietnamese killed , 
wounded, or left homeless, 11 .3 

Americans would have met cor-
responding fates if the U.S. popula-
tion had been as extensively 
affected . The resulting figur s were 
then compared to the populations 
of states in the U.S. and those state 
with comparable populations were 
so marked on the map. 

Since the land ratio is 1 :55, fifty-
five acres of dcfoliatpd land are 
projected for the U . . to every acre 
defoliated in the south of Vietnam. 
The result is a proportional 
rppre entation showing the impact 
of the war on the smaller country. 

The data used is in itself 
staggering: 
"Total civilian and militar y 
casua lties for south Vietnam alone 
are 569,000 killed and 1,326,000 
wounded; the U.S. eqUivalents are 
6,432 , 000 dead, 14,985 ,000 

wounded . These figures are based 
on U.S. governmcnt data . 
'Forty thousand civilians were ex-
ecuted without trial undN th e 
Phoenix program (acco rding to the 
Ministry of Information in aigon) 
The U .S. equivalent. 452,000, 
equals the population of Alaska . 
"Over 5 million acres -12 per cent 
of southern Vietnam - have been 
sprayed with defoliating chemicals. 
The U.S. equivalent : 434,000 square 
miles. 

The map does not reflect, 
howevcr, that in war , damage 
would be st ragcll cally inflicted to 
cripple the country most effectivp-
Iy, and forms of destruction would 
overlap. Unpredi ctable winds, for 
example, would blow defoliants 
Into population centers re~ulting in 
deaths, illness, and birth defects

The Case For A Bold New 
Program At UCSD: 

Environmental Health Planning 
by Tee L. Guidotti, for the 

Committee to Extend Medical Concern 
There is more to health than the ab-

sence of disease. In medicine we are 
taught the art of healing, but only oc-
casionally the art of protecting, and rare-
ly the art of conferring the highest attain-
able state of well-being. A group of med-
ical students, meeting informally last 
year, have discussed a specific proposal 
which could be adapted here at UCSD as 
a major contribution toward bringing 
prevention and optimization of the 
quality of life into balance with concern 
for curing and healing. 

The concept is for a graduate program 
in environmental health planning . This 
would entail the definition of a new 
health professional, who would work as a 
member of the health care team but 
whose tools are the planning and 
development of communities. Their 
training would include the essentials of 
urban and regional planning, metro-
politan administration , environmental 
quality management (such as pollution 
control, land use, and resource manage-
ment), and ecological systems. This is a 
formidable curriculum, broad and 
challenging. Elements of it are now avail-
able at the traditional schools of public 
health, planning and architecture, public 
administration, and departments of life 
sciences. It is their combination that is 
tru ly unique, because woven together 
they not only confer an understanding of 
how human settlements function and 
how the individual living in his com-
munity is affected , but couple this with 
the techniques necessary to create 
change. 

Community planning in this country 
has had mixed success, but it is generally 
recognized as Inevitably necessary as the 
society grows more complex and urban 
systems become more highly structured 
and come to accomodate more people. 
Practically every town and certainly 
every city has its planners projecting the 
development of their co mmunities on 
long and short time spans and detailing 
their visions of the future . City planning 
is often treated as a subdivi~ion of archi -
tecture, but it is quite distinct and goes 
far beyond the narrow provision-; of the 
physical structure of the communi ty. 
Health and environmental quality, un-
fortunately, have until recently been 
peripheral co nSiderations of planning, 
which has been dominated by the 
"chamber of commerce" approach em-
phamlng economic growth, population 

expan~ion, and gra ndiosity over life style, 

individual expression, and the quality of 
life. 

One dttempt to make health an in-
tegral part of planning has come with in-
terest and federal support of "compre-
hensive health planning". When it works 
well, comprehensive health planning is 
useful, but it typically restricts itself of 
planning health services, and even when 
environmental health is considered, ac-
tion is seldom effectively taken. 

A major obstacle to using community 
planning to achieve a higher standard of 
health and well-being has been the lack 
of people cross-trained in health and 
planning. Both fields are demanding 
areas of professional training and both 
are complex enough to effectively ex-
clude the interested amateur. A possible 
solution would be the training of this 
new breed of professional, who is 
generalist in understanding and special-
ist in the application of technique. 

There are many reasons why UCSD 
would be a nearly ideal location for such 
an innovative program. For one thing, 
the San Diego area is expanding rapidly, 
for better or worse. Intelligent planning 

~s badly needed and the citizens, judg-
Ing from the recent elections, are in-
formed and concerned about planning 
problems. A program such as this would 
meet a very real community need; in 
fact , it is very likely that among its first 
applicants would be present planners 
and officials wanting to extend their 
background . San Diego is a very inviting 
laboratory for innovation in planning, 
being metropolitan but small enough to 
be manageable, and with a high degree 
of citizen awareness and interest in plan-
ning. 

A program such as the one described 
would open the door to any number o f 
fields in which UCSD is lacking : en-
vironmental studies, technology assess-
ment, social policy and management, 
and planning, to name a few. The pro-
gram would be a base from which to ex-
pand in all these directions with a gen-
uinely interdisciplinary approach. Once 
pstablished as a graduate program, un -
dergraduate offerings would be a nat-
ural step, an important consideration in 
planning the staffi ng and development 
of Fourth College, which has been pro-
posed to emphasize social sciences, 
social policy and management, and even 
applipd environmental studies. It would 

al~o strengthen the prese nt programs of 
communi ty development in Third

College. While leading UCSD into new 
fields, it would a Iso efficiently utilize 
existing resources and areas of strength 
at UCSD, especially in the areas of com-
munity health, community develop-
ment, and engineering and information 
systems. 

The program would not be as difficult 
to initiate as it may seem. The American 
Institute of Planners, their principal pro-
fessional organization, has enthusiasti-
cally offered support for this proposal at 
UCSD. There is considerable local talent 
in health and planning in the San Diego 
and Los Angeles areas, from which to 
draw full- or part-time faculty and staff . 
Despite the lack of prototypes for this 
particular interdiSCiplinary approach, 

Dr Millon rrlf'dmtHl 

Henry Kissinger 

other universities have sought to deve-
lop programs with some similarities from 
which les50ns can be derived. Perhaps 
the sing le most critica l factor will be 
developing leadership that maintains the 
vision and broad perspective of the pro-
gram. To test its appeal, extension classes 
might be given initially on an experi-
mental basis. 

This is our proposal. One of the dis-
advantages of being medical students is 
that we are sharply restricted in the time 
we have to promote and develop such an 
Idea ourselves, and for this reason we 
have brought it to the attention of the 
larger university community. We hope 
that it will lead to some stimulating 
discussion.

Most people are spurred 
to write "letters to the edi-

co unter a person, or-
ganiLa tion or situation 
which particularly frust-
rates, annoys or disgusts 
them. Th is practice vents a 
lot of sp leen, fill s up the 
" letters" co lumns and may 
resul t in some beneficial 
changes. 

But reading always 
criticisms (o f the incom-

fessor, of the malfeasance 
of some minor adminis-
trator, or of the sappy atti-
tude of some student) be-
comes boring after a time. 
For the sake of variety then, 
and also because I think 
that outsta nding perfor-

Members of MAXA YN

gorize their music, but 
Maxayn herself says, "It's 
spontaneous . We don't 
plan it . It just works out. It's

Sometimes the music is 
more important, and some-
times the lyrics are more 
important . "

24 Hours 

The Long Run For Money 
In a recent attempt to raise money for the track team 

and at the same time impress UCSD with their partan 
endurance, 10 athletes ran for 24 hours last ov. 17 in a 
continuous relay. They did succeed in their attempt to 
raise mane), for the track team by collectIng ap-
proximately $300, but as for trying to impress the girls 
from Muir, well, that was spoiled when Don Campbell 
ran the last mile with a bottle of Pink Chablis in ither 
hand. The runner~ did cove r 247.2 miles in one of the 
long r days of their lives, but fell a little short of the 
world record of 272 miles set by Cal State Fulll.'rton. 

Each man would run one mile and Ihen pass th baton 
to the next man, a in effect each man ran about a mile 
an hour_ 

The pace was just a little short of blistering for the firsl 
eighl hours, which th('y ran faster than world record 
time by covering over 100 miles. For the first 12 hours Ed 
Avol, Mike Bergkamp, Mike De osa and Mile "Iron 
man" Diaz consistently ran their miles under five 
minutes, but the chill of night, lack of food, etc. caused 
them to slacken th i r pac!.' after that.

Bergkamp, the cross-country ace, with th most 
strategic mile. Mike, in a blaze of speed , covered the 
course in 17 :42, just edging out Dave Robinson who 
had an exce llent time of 9:08. Contrary to libelous 
rumor Mike did not make a quick visit to his girlfriend's apart~ent. The team gave Mike DeSosa the stupidest 
mile award when he turn ed in a 4:47 mile, the fastest 
time turned in. The endurance award goes to Rick 
Pomeroy, who managed to stay awake for 20 of the 24 
hours timing th ese idiots. 

This may seem like a strange way to make some 
money, but with an athletic budget that shows as much 
green as Death Valley on a dry day, one gets the g~neral 
picture. This was either the greatest sports effort In the 
history of Ihe school, or the weakest excuse to have a

Varsity Challenges 
Alumni Today 

Wh en thinking about 
great mismat hes in sports: 
Ali vs. Foster, Juan Marichal 
vs. Johnny Ro seboro, 
UCLA's basketball team 
against anybody-today 
one more will be added to 
the list. The highly-tout d 
(at least in this newspaper) 
UCSD varsity basketball 
team is going to scrimmage 
a bunch of rickelY old men 
in th(' gym at 4:30 today . 
Yes, such stars of yester-
year as Brian Todd, Guy 
DiMonte, and Mark Wilson 
have gotten together a 
team, and call themselves 

the U Su Alumni. So if you 
ever wondered what it was 
lik watching the lions and 
the Christians frolic 
together in an ient Rome, 
you might be interested in 
today's contpst. Warning : 
this is not for the weak of 
heart and there probably 
will not be a doctor pre-
sent, and if you don't like 
massanes you would be 
well advised not to attend . 
But if you're caught in the

I 
Will rent contr.ol Berkeley? University Lutheran Church 

StuderttCenter 
AF Press Service 

Berke ley, Calif.-Rent 
control IS a nightmare to 
landlorc' s and a sweet 
dream te tenants, but it 's 
not nece;sarily as far from 
reality as it may seem at the 
fir s t of each m 0 nth . 
Berkeley, California, for in-
stance, is the latest example 
of how a city's tenants can 
unite to put the brakes on 
the rising costs of scarce 
housing . But Berkeley 
tenants are already learn-
Ing that achieving real rent 
control is a lot harder than 
simply passing a local in -
itiative amendment. 

Despite a ma ssiv ely 
financed campaign by 
Berkele y's Board of 
Realtor (who shelled out 
$50,000 compared to the 
supporters' $2,000) , an in-
it iative to amend the city 
cha rt e r was passed last 
June, ca lling for a rollback 
of all rents to the August , 
1971 level and establishing 
an elected Rent Control 
Board to administer and 
regulate hous ing and ren-
tals in this city of 130,000. In 
the meantime, all rents are 
legally froze n as of August 
2, 1972, when the Berkeley 
Rent Control Amendment 
was signed into law. 

The Berkeley law was 
designed specifica ll y to 
avoid problems en-
countered in other areas, 
such as Cambridge , 
Massachusetts, a city of 
similar size where a rent 
control amendment was 
passed a fev. years ago. The 
Cambridge board is ap-
pOinted by the city coun-
cil , but Berkeley 's will be 
elected. In Cambridge, new 
buildings are exempt from-
control and as a result 
deve lopers have been tear-

ing down older buildings to 
allow for rapid con-
stru ction of new non con-
trolled housing . In 
Berkeley, though, all in-
creases and decreases, and 
even rents on new units, 
will be controlled by the 
elected board. 

The Rent Control Board 
to be elected next January 
will have considerable 
power over a va riet y of is-
sues su rrounding the 
housing cris is. Therefore, 
Berkeley citizens are an-
Xiously wondering ju t how 
the new board will per-
form its u npreced nted 
duties. 

Passage of the rent con-
trol amendment promised 
to end the steady rent in-
creases which have plagued 
Berkeley te nants si nce the 
end of World War II , but it 
is a victory that wi" be 
snatched away if the ci ty's 
tenants don 't guard it ac-
tively. 

Rent con trol was 
designed to cu t landlords' 
profits, a nd freezing rents 
at sum mer rates in a city 
which has such a la rge stu-
dent population did catch 
some landlords off guard. 
However, in the months 
since the rent freeze went 
into effect, dozens of land-
lords have raised rents . One 
of Berkeley's largest 
management companies, 
B&G Propert ies, retu rned 
to its winter rat es in 
September in flagrant viola-
tion of the freeze; this 
meant rent innea es of up 
to 50 per cent on some of its 
700 units . Other landlords 
have indicated a similar dis-
regard for the new city law 
and the City Attorney's of-
fice is receiving 5-10 com-

plaints of violations daily. 
City officials have been 

hostile to rent control since 
its inception and now that it 
is law the city is continuing 
to undermine the amend-
ment by refusing to en-
force the freeze . The law 
states that any landlord who 
demands or accepts an il-
legal rent increase i sub-
ject to a $200 fine, payable 
to the tenant , and that the 
landlord must also pay the 
tenant's lawyer, but City 
Attorney Donald 
McCu "um's office is 
refUSing to register tenant 's 
complaints or pursue 
reca lcitrant landlords. The 
City Manager's projected 
plan for "freeze enforce-
ment" calls for an $11 ,000 
bureaucracy to register 
complaints, but apparently 
no prosecution of freeze 
violators. Meanwhile, six 
Berkeley landlords, claim-
ing that the ci ty has no 
authority to limit rent s, 
have filed suit to invalidate 
the control amendment.

ARE YOU SINGIN' THOSE 
FRANTIC FINALS 

BLUES? 
Got the blues over biology? Anguished over 
anthro? Panicking over psych? Or just plain 
exasperated over exams? 

Know what students at Cal do when they get 
the blues? They read Fybate Lecture Notes. 

Fybate Lecture Notes are notes taken 
in lecture courses at Berkeley. Each set 
of notes is a clear, concise, comprehen-
sive account of all the lectures in one 
course. It's written in plain English. 
And it's in outline form, so you can 
locate any topic easily. 

Fybates have been helping folks over at Berk-
eley for 38 years. They're also helping stud-
ents at about 175 other colleges. Now they 
can help you. 

Fybates banish the blues- yes, even if you're 
mourning over music. (They've got courses 
in that, too.)

Reply to Jack Sage ... 
continued from page 5 

Not only does "Sage" mutilate statements he quotes, 
thus distorting their meaning, he reads very selectively. 
Thus, when he read the report hostile to Israel which 
appea red in THE TIMES of London, 0 t. 28, 1969, he 
blithely ignored the "perhaps" which the author in-
corporated into his comparison of the "mood" in th e 
occupied. territories in Israel with that in occupied 
France in 1942. He didn't notice that in his article the 
author reported mostly hearsay and conjecture -
something which the readers of THE TIME noticed im-
mediately and said so in letters to the editor published 
the next two days. One such corr spond nt , a member 
of parliament and a defencE' lawyer for 13 years, char-
acterized the article as "slanderou and wholly un-
corroborated." 

"Sage" pulls out some of the old torture chestnuts 
too. He quotes something which purports to come from 
George Carvallo in Life, Apr . 13, 1968. There is no Apr. 
13, 1968 issue of Life! However, I made allowances lor 
"Jack," and searched in the issues for Apr. 12, Apr. 19, 
and Apr. 5. I found finally in the Apr. 5 issue an anicle 
on terrorists by George de Carvalho. 

Here again "Jack Sage" doesn ' t see all that's there, or 
at least doesn't report it all. Here is the statement he 
quotes, with the. clause which he o~its in bol?fa~e: 
"From interrogation rooms I heard prisoners shrieking 
an d sobbing. Captured terrorists must expect torture 
(A rab police inflict it on their own people) but it was 
horrible to hear ." To be sure, there is still some am-
biguity in the passage, but with the omitted phrase re-
sto red, the statement takes on an altogeth r different 
connotation . De Carvalho may not be reporting tort-
ure at all , but rather simply fear or expectation of tort-
:Jre. You will note that he doesn't say he saw prisoners 
tort ured ; he only heard them shriek as if they were be-
ing tortured. That this is probably his intended mean-
ing is supported by his telling us that the next day t"':'o of 
Ihe captives wer displayed to the press! Not very likely 
if they were maimed and abused by torture. Indeed, a 
photo of one of the "victims" appears in the same issue : 
there is not a scratch on him! 

These horror stories which are manufactured from 
time to time have very little surface credibility - ex-
cept to pathological minds - because Israel is an open 
socie ty . Even Arabs from countries nominally at war 
with Israel have been coming to Israel in great num-
be rs as tourists . Is it not ,ignificant that following the 
civil war which raged in Jordan not long ago, the de-
fea ted Palestinians fled 10 Israel for sanctuary? There is 
no censorship in Israel f)f political writings. If torture 
were really practiced, it wl)uld no doubt get wide cir-

make the comparison with the lot of Jews in Arab lands, 
but one should keep it in m;nd.) There b no question in 
the minds of objective observers that the Arabs under 
Israeli admin istration are bE'tter off than they have ever 
been, economicaUy, educa:ionally, culturally, a nd even 
politically. 

Economically - their per capita income has doubl d 
since 1968, agricultural production has tripled, and they 
have expanded their exports. Arabs are freely admitted 
to His tadrut , the general federation of labor. 

Medically - the death rate among Arabs is one-third 
what it wa s in 1948. The infant mortality rat among 
Arabs in Israel is iower than in any Arab state. 

Educationally - 95% of Israel 's Arab children attend 
school. Arabic is their language of instru ction , though 
of course they study Hebrew too . In addition , they are 
free to attend Hebrew-language schools if they prefer. 
On graduation from high school they may attend the 
Hebrew University if academically qualified , or go 
abroad. 

Culturally - they practice their religion freely. Bus 
pilgrimages are organized to Mecca . Their mosques are 
protected . Moslem courts handle marriage and div-
orce cases. Newspapers, magazines , and books in 
Arabic appear regularly . Arabi c literature flourishes. 

Politica"y - they have full voting rights with Jewish 
citizens of Israel. Arabs are in the Knesset (legislature) 
and have occupied posts in the national government. 
The Arab municipalities elect their own officials. Arabs 
have freedom to say or print any of their polit ica l views.

At Breier Sound Center we believe that it is not the money you 
save, but what you get for the money you <;pend which 
determines a good value in a stereo system. For that reason we 
sell a $385 Component system consisting of KLH , Garrard and 
Shure products. 

Our ystem features a KLH model Fifty-one AM-FM tereo 
receiver which delivers a total of 40 RMS watts into a pair of KLH 
model Seventeen speakers. The eventeens are a two way 
speaker system which also happen to be one of our be telling 
models. A Garrard 42M automatic turntable fitted with a hure 
M75ECS cartridge and di amond needle round out the system . 

. The $385 price tag does show a avings of $105 .80 off the 
individual elling prices of the eparate component . But-v'" 
repeat-it is the product and not the a ing, v.hic h make thi
