Celebration expressed through acting, dancing and ethnic music 
IJAUXJ.UI 
Sta" Writer 

UCSO's Kaibigang Pilipino club hosted its 
ninth annual Pilipino Cultural Celebration 
Saturday night at Mandeville Auditorium. 

Since 1987, Kaibigang Pilipino has served to 
address the needs and issues of Filipino 
American UCSD students. 

The show featured various aspects of past 
and present Filipino culture:. Stories were told 
through music, dance and acting. In addition, 
the stories presented everything from the plight 
of Filipino farmworkc:rs in 19305 America to 
addressing the crisis of identity many Filipino 
Americans face today. 

Most dances were: accompanied by live musi-
cians on both sides of the: $tage. The event was 
multimedia, with video images. sophistica.m 

lighting and sound effects adding to the effect. 
Jesson Duller, scriptwriter for the event, told 

the Filipino American story. . 
MI [felt[ as if I was supposed to write the 

script for [the Pilipino Cultural Celebrationl 
this year: Duller said. "I know that these are 
stories of our lives, like I know the rhythm of 
my heartbeat.n 

Throughout the night, the show took on a 
dream-like quality, fitting for the event's theme, 
"Imagine.n 

The shows producers were quick to point out 
its significance. In promoting imagination , the 
producers said that one rejects society'S insis-
tence on conformity and structUre and that 
through one's imagination, one can be free.

Rezzies 2000 
Honors Staff 
and Students 
Marshall and Warren take 
home top honors in college 
residence life competition 
Iy REIECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

Students, residential advisors and staff 
were honored at Rezzies 2000, the second 
annual all-campus residence life recognition 
ceremony held last Wednesday night. 

The Academy A\vards-Iike ceremony was 
started last year by Oliver Butterick, former 
national residence hall honorary chair, who 
wanted to give residential life leaders at 
UCSD an opportunity to recognize their 
peers. 

A committee comprised of two students 
from each college voted for the finalists in 
each awarded category. 

Katrinna Bachand, chair of the Rezzies 
Committee, said Rezzies 2000 promotes 
unity on campus. 

"Each college does a lot of their own 
programs: she said, "but the ceremony 
allows all the residential life councils and 
RAs to meet: . 

Ben Epperson, master of ceremonies at 
the event, said residential life committees 
are an important part of social life for stu-
dents living on campus. . 

"The primary goal is to get residents out 
and to help them keep a balance in their life 
and help them meet people: he said. 

Epperson added that the ceremony pro-
vides the opportunity for people involved in 
residential life to see what the other colleges 
are doing and gain feedback. 

Director of the Office of Housing and 
Dining Services Larry Barrett, who will retire 
in June, was awarded the distinguished ser-
vice award, and a special video presentation 
was shown as a tribute to his work. 

Barrett has worked for the University of 
California for 36 years. He said the ceremo-
ny is important because it is the only event 
on campus that gives students and RAs 
recognition for their residential life work. 

"Students that have shown dedication 
and creativity need to be recognized." he 
said. 

A variety of activities planned by stu-
dents on residential life committees and the 
residential advisors were awarded . 
Marshall's Student Committee on 
Residential Enhancement won Outstanding 
College Residence Committee. 

Marshall also won the Most Original 
Program category. Through community ser- . 
vice efforts, the residents of the COllege 
raised over $2,000 for Marshall sophomore 
Dus,tin Demont, who was diagnosed with a 
brain tumor. 

Warren won the Outstanding 
Educational Program by staff category with 
"Beer Goggles,n where residents wore 
blurred swim goggles and attempted to drive 
a remote-controlled car and raise drunk-
driving awareness. 

MI was extremely honored, n said Chris 
West, winner of the Outstanding Residence 
Committee Executive category. "I thought 
there was a lot of good candidates up for the 
award. They are all excellent leaders."

The most visual demonstration of 
videspread student frustration was 
he vigil. Despite the attendance of 
(ey college administrators and the

Senior Associate Dean Dan 
e1son. Dean of Residential Life 

·viartin Redman. Dean of the College 
ames Larimore and Dean of First-
lear Students Gail Zimmerman 
mended the vigil to engage in a dia-
ogue with students. 

Fifty-four disgruntled students 
.igned a petition for guaranteed 
!lousing and 20 students recorded 
their personal stories of anguish. all of 
which were presented to President 
James Wright last Friday morning at 9 
d.m. 

The petition at the vigil addressed 
more than j ust the housing crunch.

·Ients perceived as underlying reasons 
,or the lack of sufficient on-campus 
residences. 

While Redman did admit that col-
lege resources are not vast enough to 
, /low the entire student body to be in 
"esidence during any single tenn. he 
Jefended the design by pointing out 
that students are able to select their 
1wn housing off-terms. 

Larimore and Redman agreed that 
with the expected addition of 500 new 
')Cds. the college shaul(:! be in a position 
,0 guarantee housing to all interested 
:.tudents within the next five years. 

Redman qualified this statement

ased on an estimate of housing

, lin percentage of the student popu-

I ~tion which would prefer to live off

George W Bush 5 plan to implement personal investment retirement 

accounts will save the doomed Social Security system 
By TllEODOIII DOKKO 
Staff Writer 

Earlier this month, governor of 
Texas, George W. Bush, said in a 
major speech that if the American 
people were to elect him to succeed 
President Bill Clinton, one of his first 
priorities would be to reform Social 
Security. Offering generalized ideas. 
Bush said he would seek to allow 
taxpayers to take a small portion of 
what they currently pay in Social 
Security payroll taxes and put them 
into individual retirement accounts 
that could be invested at the taxpay-
er's discretion. However, the majori-
ty of the tax would stay in place so 
that those near retirement or living 
off Social Security would be guaran-
teed the funds they need. 

Hours after Bush delivered his 
speech, his Democratic rival Vice 
President AI Gore, in his usual attack 
mode, criticized the plan. He said 
that if such a plan were enacted, the 
government would be taking away 
the security net the monthly checks 
provide, which retirees deperid on. 
He went on to say that doing so 
would be like paying ustock market 
roulette." He derided the lack of 

specifics, saying the "secret plan· was 
based on "smug assumptions.· 

In typical Democratic fashion, the 
vice president felt the best way to 
solve the problem was to throw as 
much money at it as possible. Gore 
insisted that his plan to use the pro-
jected surplus in Social Security 
taxes to pay the federal debt and to 
use the billions of dollars in interest 
saved from debt reduction would 
serve to shore ur the Social Security 
Trust Fund unti 2050: 

The two competing proposals 
from the two presidential candidates 
show one of the starkest contrasts 
between Gore and Bush. It is inter-
esting that the issue of Social 
Security reform has been considered 
the third rail of politics. Everyone 
knows the system is broken and in 
need of reform, yet many a politician 
have tried to make and enact propos-
als that would lengthen the system's 
solvency, but have been taking a 
beating in public opinion polls. 

All agree that unless something is 
done before the Baby Boom genera-
tion retires, the 1hIst Fund will go 
bankrupt. By the time the Baby 
Boom generation retires, the work 
force of this nation will be dwarfed 

by the retirement community. It is 
projected that two workers will be 
supporting every one Social Security 
recipient. 
. This ratio is alarming considering 
the fact that when President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt signed the bill that 
made Social Security a reality, there 
were 16 workers for every one Social 
Security recipient. Two politicaUy 
unpopular ways of solving the prob-
lem would be either to cut some 
benefits or to raise the retirement 
age. If any politician were to.propose 
such a reform, they would be 
lau$hed out of office. In order to 
aVOid the harsh reality of the trust 
fund running out of money and 
either raising the retirement age 
and/or cutting benefits, it is clear that 
soll'!ething must be done. 

It seems that as we: are in the 
midst of this unprecedented pros-
perity, now is the most opportune 
time to fix Social Security. Sadly, our 
vice president can only offer short-
sighted and timid ideas. According to 
John Goodman, the president of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis. 
"Gore is taking a reactionary 
approach. He is not rejecting just 
specific proposals. he is rejecting the 

whole idea of changing the program, 
and that's too bad, because they have 
to change." 

If Gore is elected and he enacts 
his ideas, the United States will be 
putting a mere Band-Aid on the 
problem. Even if the surplus is used 
to payoff the federal debt and the 
interest payments are used to shore 
up Social Security, the federal gov-
ernment will be paying a whopping 
$SOO billion a year just on Social 
Security payments by 2020. This gar-
gantuan amount is larger then the 
anticipated bill for all other discre-
tionary spending. With such a large 
bill to pay for just Social Security, it 
remains a mystery whether 
Washington could then afford to pay 
for other important domestic needs. 
such as Medicare and education. 

The Bush' proposal, which has 
received support from Senators 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., 
Bob Kerry, D-Neb., and Bush's 
Republican primary rival John 
McCain, R-Ariz., would not only 
help reduce the government spend-
ing, but it would also help the indi-
vidual retiree. The small portion that

Harassment Policy Has Reasonable Safeguards 
Editor: 
I appreciate Brent Don's com-

ments regarding UCSD's efforts 
to maintain and promote " ... a 
safe, productive environment 
becoming a major university· 
("Fighting Words: May 8) . 
However, his comments regarding 
the UCSD "fighting words policy· 
clearly indicate a lack of under-
standing of the applicability of 
that policy to UCSD students. 

In recognition of the impor-
tance of free: expression, as pro-
tected under tbe First 
Amendment of the U.S. 
Constitution, UC General 
Counsel has issued mandatory 
guidelines for the application at 
UCSD of the "fighting words pol-
icy: Those guidelines state, in rel-
evant part: 

"Use of fighting words ... 
(1) The policy defines prohib-

ited 'fighting words' as: 'those 
personally abusive epithets 
which, when directly addressed to 
any ordinary person are, in the 
context used and as a matter of 
common knowledge, inherently 
likely to provoke a violent reac-
tion whether or not they actually 
do so. l2) To be subject to the 
public. 'fighting words' must be 
inherently likely to produce an 
immediate violent reaction. (3) To 
be: subject to the policy, 'fighting 
words' must be directly addressed 
to the subject of the epithets ..... 

Contrary to the statement in 
Don's anicle, UC General 
Counsel's guidelines also make it 
clear that derogatory references to • 
personal characteristics are not 
automatically fighting words 
under the policy if the other 
requirements of the definition are 
not met. Moreover, to ensure that 
the: policy is strictly applied in

conformance to the guidelines, 
any application of the policy must 
have prior approval from the UC 
Office of the General Counsel.

words· policy and the guidelines 
can be found on the Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs Web 
site at httpjlugr8.ucsd.eduljudicial 
122 OO.html'22.14.10 

The implementation of the 
UCSD student conduct code, and 
the "fighting words· policy in par-
ticular is also guided by UCSD's 
dedication to learning, teaching 
and serving society through edu-
cation, research and public ser-
vice. Consistent with Principles of 
Community, UCSD also endeav-
ors to foster the best possible 

working and learning environ-
ment, and we strive to maintain 
a climate of fairness, coopera-
tion and professionalism. In our 
attempt to balance free: expres-
sion. with a campus environ-
ment that is true to the UCSD 
Principles of Community, the 
"fighting words' policy has 
been narrowly interpreted and it 
has been applied in only those 
few instances that clearly create 
the real threat to peace and 
order in the UCSD community. 

In closing, I agree with Don's 
view that our society too often 
relies on legal provisions and 
regulations to try to enforce 
Sood behavior. I would add that 
It is unrealistic to view the 
UCSD student conduct code as 
the guarantor of civility and 
mutual respect among members 
of the UCSD community. I look 
forward to the day when differ-
ences can be resolved through 
reason and ration in face-to-
face dialogues. 

Thank you for your interest 
in this very important issue to 

the UCSD community, and please 
feel free to con tact me if you have 
any questions ' regarding UCSD 
student policies.

30-Year-Old Tragedy 
Still Haunts UCSD 
In May of 1970, a UCSD student set fire to 
himself in Revelle to protest the Vzetnam war 
By 111M IOYCHUK 
Special to the Guardian 

The popular version of the 
1960s is a tale told by baby-
boomers who acted like hippies but 
fought on like the Viet Congo 

This year marks the passage of 
more than 30 years since many of 
the events from the turbulent era 
that began with the assassination of 
John F. Kennedy and ended with 
the resignation of Richard Nixon 
and America 's tragic withdrawal 
from Vietnam. 

However, as those days recede 
into memory, we risk remembering 
the decade more from biased pro-
paganda than from historical truth. 
The reason is simple: For many of 
today's media elite and cultural lib-
erals, the '60s represent a revolu-
tion in which they undermined the 
mores of a corrupt America and 
replaced them with their own stan-
dards of relativism and liberation. 

Even UCSD claims a connec-
tion to this self-serving version of 
Vietnam-era mythOlOgy. 

On May 10, 1970, a 23-year-old 
graduate student named George 
Winne walked onto Revelle Plaza 
carrying a placard and a can of 
gasoline. On the placard was a 
message scrawled in red crayon 
that said: "In the name of God, end 
the war: 

Winne then poured the gasoline 
over himself and lit a match. 

Winne was emulating the 
Buddhist monks in Cambodia who 
did the same to protest the inva-
sion of their country, but Winne 
lacked an essential monkish char-

acteristic - discipline. 
Winne wanted to immolate 

himself, as one letter-writer to the 
Guardian put it, "in Ithel honor-
able eastern tradition : However, 
he did not burn stoically. He 
flailed . He screamed. Then he col-
lapsed. He succumbed the next 
day to the second- and third-
degree burns that covered 9S per-
cent of his body. 

Winne is barely remembered 
today, except by a handful of peo-
ple who were there. Most students 
on campus today were not even 
alive at the time, much less have 
ever heard of him. So why remem-
ber Winne at all? 

In part, because he is a window 
to the tragic duplicity that made 
the 1960s an ideological night-
mare, from which America still has 
not quite awakened. 

I was at UCSD 10 years ago, 
when a handful of students held a 
memorial for Winne. Borrowing 
terms from a religious imagery they 
despised, they lit candles and called 
him a martyr. 

What they were really doing was 
keeping the lie alive. 

After the memorial , as a fresh-
man editorial writer for the 
Guardian, I was charged with plac-
ing Winne's sorry end into context. 

Even then, 20 years after the 
incident, the editorial board was 
divided on how to tackle the ques-
tion. One vocal faction felt that 
Winne made a noble sacrifice for 
his beliefs and ought to be recog-
nized for it. The rest believed his

death was a meaningless act by a 
troubled man caught up in the 
fury and mass psychology that 
was 1960s resistance. 

In 1990, Generation X had a 
hard time sorting it out. So the 
editorial was a mixed creation: 
Maybe Winne was a martyr, and 
maybe he was not. In any case, 
wasn't it time America got over 

letnam? 
~ypical of most Americans, the 

s were meant to solemnize a 
drade r selfishness. 

• n~ nn t h Ip but won-
er: rea the penultimate para-
mph. "if Winne Yo: uld have bet-

ter ser\'l"d hi cause by fighting 
~ r peace In tead f dying for it." . 

Many people probably do not 
remember Winne on the anniver-
sary of his death, and surely the 
next one will have but a wisp of 
the confusion and ideologica l 
opportunism that made him a 
tragic hero. 

Re-reading that editorial, I was 
reminded how stupid and wrong 
it was. We made claims and asser-
tions about the Vietnam War that 
accorded with conventional wis-
dom that I now know to be false. 

With the end of the Cold War, we 
can confront those murders and 
crimes perpetrated in the name of 
leftist revolutions and utopian 
dreams. 

In a small way, we can all see 
- if only we look - how wide-
spread the struggles of lies and 
truth can be in politics. What is 
sad is that for people around the 
world, the imperfections of the 
United States were their last 
hope in a world of slaughter and 
revenge. The Communist 
Dream, rather than creating 11 
workers ' paradise, cost more 
than 100 million people their 
lives. 

This is what makes Winne 
worth remembering - not as a 
martyr, or a man of principle, or 
an icon of counter-cultural 7.eal. 
His death is a worthy symbol of 
the age in which he lived, and 
the ideology to which he 
adhered. Like so many during 
that time, it was not the blessing 
of life that mattered . It was the 
youthful , thoughtless fight for a 
lie that knew no bounds and 
had one inexorable hatred: the 
truth .

Security: 
Current prosperity can 
save Social Security 
CoatInued".. ..... 4 
the taxpayer saves would be 
invested by the individual in order 
to get the greatest return . This 
will allow the taxpayer to accu-
mulate some sort of wealth to 
enjoy during his or her retirement 
years. This is already what more 
wealthy retirees do when they 
invest in Individual Retirement 
Accounts. 

To say that such a plan is 
risky is simply unfair. The vice 
president cannot have it both 
ways when he says that such an 
investment idea is risky, yet at the 
same time claims the Clinton-
Gore administration is responsi-
ble for the great economy, when 
it really owes much of its great-
ness to the stock market. Even 
with bear markets and crashes, 
money invested in stocks clearly 
gives the highest return com-
pared to any other form of 
investment. According to 
Moynihan, the senior Democrat 
on the Senate Finance 
Committee, under the Bush plan, 
"You're not risking anything like 
retirement benefits. They're 
fixed . They're guaranteed. This is 
jus~ an extra thing." 

Under the governor's plan, 
with retirees being able to man-
age their own investments, peo-
ple will not be as dependent on 
monthly Social Security pay-
ments. By creating an indepen-
den t retirement system, the fed-
eral government no longer 
becomes the major source of 
income for retirees. Thus the 
government will be able to 
reduce its payments to millions 
of retirees. The government 
could eventually reduce its com-
mitment to retirees while they 
are still provided for. 

With the economy enjoying 
such great prosperity, now is the 
greatest opportunity to shore up 
the Social Security program's sol-
vency. Gore's ideas let this oppor-
tunity pass forcing future leaders 
and generations who will be to 
make painful and unpopular 
decisions. 

On the other hand, Bush's 
idea of allowing citizens to con-
trol a portion of their retirement 
possesses a certain extent of 
bipartisan support and allows for 
all to gain in the growth of the 
stock market. His ideas allow 
America to live up to its commit-
ment to its retirees today while: 
allowing its individual citizens to 
earn a greater return on their tax 
money, creating a small amount 
of wealth for all.

Social Democrats Prevail in Geiman Elections 

BERLIN - The governing 
Social Democrats won a comfort-
able victory Sunday in Germany's 
largest state, North Rhine-
Westphalia, confirming both the 
resurgence of Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder and the plight of the 
opposition Christian Democrats. 

Reliable projections from 
German television gave the Social 
Democrats 43.5 percent of the 
vote and the Christian Democrats 
37 percent. Before a major finan-
cial scandal engulfed the Christian 
Democrats six months ago, the 
party appeared poised to win the 
state, which has been governed by 
the Social Democrats for 34 years. 

The Christian Democratic can-
didate, juergen Ruettgers, was 

unable to overcome the effects of 
the scandal, and his decision to try 
an anti-immigrant message in a 
pragmatic part of Germany back-
fired. 

As a result, Wolfgang Clement, 
59, the Social Democratic premier 
of the state, who has been pursu-
ing the economic transformation 
of areas once dominated by coal 
and steel, will remain in office -
almost certainly in a coalition with 
the environmentalist Greens. 

Clement resembles Schroeder 
in that he is a reformist deter-
mined to move the party toward 
the center. 

In a state of 18 million people, 
a major shift is under way from 
heavy industry toward media, 

Internet, telecommunications and 
electronic businesses that now 
have a major presence in Cologne, 
Essen, Dortmund and the state 
capital, Duesseldorf. 

"We benefited from a tail wind 
out of Berlin, and we are proud of 
what we have achieved: said 
Fran7. Muenterfering. the secretary 
general of the Social Democrats. 
After an indifferent first year in 
office, Schroeder's popularity has 
risen as his policies have become 
clearer and the Christian 
Democrats have reeled. 

Still, in the projections from 
exit polls and early returns. the 
Social Democrats' share of the 
vote appeared to have fallen about 
2.5 percent from the 46 percent 

the party won in the last state elec-
tion, in 1995. The Christian 
Democrats' vote appeared to have 
fallen by about 1 percent. 
Schroeder has often appeared 
popular by default rather than 
through any particular personal 
appeal. 

According to the projections, 
the Greens took 7.1 percent of the 
vote, a sharp decrease from the 10 
percent they won in 1995. They 
were overtaken as the third party 
by a resurgent Free Democratic 
Party, which more than doubled 
its vote - to 9.5 percent, from 4 
percent five years ago.

AI Spring Retums, Search for Dead Resumes in Kosovo 
DjAKOVlCA, Yugoslavia -

With winter over, tearns from the 
hternational war crimes tribunal 
in The Hague have resumed their 
digging in Kosovo, searching for 
bOdies and other clues that would 
back the indictment of the 
Yugoslav president, Siobodan 
Milosevic, and four of his top allies 
in Serbia on charges of genocide 
committed before and during 
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia 
last spring. 

In the 195 sites examined last 
year, the number of bodies found 
has been less than initially report-
ed to the tribunal - in part 
because of apparent Serbian tam-
pering with the graves. The inves-
tigators have 300 sites to examine 
this year, and in just three weeks 
have exhumed 160 bodies. 

Of those, 120 were dug up in 
the cemetery at Djakovica, a town 
in southwestern Kosovo that is 
said to have experienced some of 
the worst violence by Serbs 
against Albanians during the war. 

"We are exhuming those who 
are alleged to have been killed by 
war crimes, to try and find the 
cause of death 3nd identify the 
person as best we can," said 
Eamon Smyth, the forensic pro-
ject manager. 

Serbian military and police 
forces went on a rampa~e in 
Djakovica as NATO began Its air 
strikes on March 24, 1999.

In the 195 sites examined last year, the number of 
bodies found has been less than initially reported 
to the tribunal - in part because of apparent 
Serbian tampering with the graves. The 

-investigators have 300 sites to examine this year, 
and in just three weeks have exhumed 160 bodies. 

Fifty of the bodies have not 
been identified. 

Djakovica is the site of two of 
seven massacres that figure in the 
tribunal's indictment for murder, 
persecution and deportation 
against Milosevic and his four 
allies. 

forces in the city prompted a sec-
ond purge of the civilian popula-
tion. 

Some 1 ,500 people disap-
peared from Djakovica in the 
three months of NATO bombing. 
Some of those missing have 
turned up in Serbian jails, but 

most are presumed dead. 
Philip Caine, director of the 

tribunal 's investigations in 
Kosovo, said the first priority is to 
investigate sites connected with 
the indictment of Yugoslav lead-
ers. The need for relatives to 
know the fate of loved ones, the 
practical considerations of future 
construction avoiding mass 
graves, and the desire for an accu-
rate picture of the scale of 
Serbian violence will also drive 
the tribunal to investigate other 
sites suspected of being . mass 
graves, Caine said. 

The war crimes tribunal has 
reports of more than 11 ,000 bod-
ies in 500 graves, but generally 
the actual number of bodies 
found has been lower than that 
reported. 

Investigators have drawn a 
blank at some of the sites of the 
most notorious alleged mas-
sacres.

Palestine: 
Some protesters caLled for 
release pf prisoners 
ContInued frOlll ..... 1 
Palestinian man was ki lled. 

Some of the demonstrators 
were calling for Israel to release 
Palestinian prisoners, while in a 
military prison in Megiddo in 
northern Israel. the prisoners 
themselves rioted, burning the 
tents in which they are kept as 
Israeli guards used tear gas and 
rubber bullets to control them. 

Other demonstrators appealed 
as much to Palestinian as to Israeli 
leaders; some refugees, firing their 
weapons into the air, marched 
through Ramallah to demand that 
the refugee issue not be shunted 
aside in the peace negotiations. 

It was the start of a second 
volatile week on the Palestinian 
streets as Yasser Arafat, the 
Palestinian leader, tolerated -
some say encouraged - an out-
pouring of pent-up frustration . 
Frustrated himself by a lack of 
progress at the peace table, Arafat 
stepped back and let young 
Palestinians send their unsettling 
message to Israelis. 

In response, Israeli right-wing 
leaders sei7.ed on the televised 
images of rock-throwing. masked 
and anned Palestinians - images. 
like those of the Israeli soldiers firing 
into the crowds, that have been little 
seen since Prime Minister Ehud 

Barak was elected a year ago on 
a peacemaking platform. 

The right-wing leaders 
demanded that the peace negotia-
tions be suspended until Arafat 
called off what they called a new 
intifada. 

Unrelated to the talks, or so it 
was said, the Israelis did release one 
long-time prisoner Sunday, Salah 
Shihadah, the first commander of 
the military wing of Hamas, the 
Islamic fundamentalist group. He 
had been held for two years with-
out charges after serving a 10-year 
sentence.

ALBANY, N.Y. - Over the last 
several months, Gov. George Pataki 
has become one of the most visible 
pitchmen of the airwaves, starring 
in five television advertising cam-
paigns paid for by state agencies 
under his control, for causes from 
children's health care to energy 
conservation, at a total cost to tax-
payers of about $20 million. 

Put another way, New York 
state is spending as much money 
from the public treasury to put 
Pataki's face before the public as 
the total spent in his 1998 re-elec-
tion campaign. 

The spots advertise Pataki at 
least as much as their ostensible 
subjects, prompting the charge by 
government reform groups and 

Democrats that they are nothing 
more than a veiled political cam-
paign at government expense. 

Michael McKeon, Pataki's com-
municatwns director, said of such 
criticism, "The world is, unfortu-
nately, full of cynics who would 
rather play politics than applaud 
accomplishments. W 

The governor, a Republican, is 
not the first politician to use his 
power to advertise himself with 
public money, nor the first to be 
critici7.ed for it. In fact, the immedi-
ate response from several adminis-
tration officials was that the same 
thing had been done by the gover-
nor's predecessor, Mario Cuomo, 
by New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, by Gov. Christie Whitman 

of New jersey and by Gov. John 
Rowland of Connecticut. 

Pataki's current exposure is 
extraordinary, and it far exceeds the 
others' efforts. In addition to ads 
for children's health care, energy 
conservation and the environment, 
which are all new this year, the 
governor is starring in perennial 
campaigns promoting tourism and 
the state's economic recovery. 

While some governments, like 
New , York City'S and 
Connecticut's, prohibit politicians 
from appearing in advertising at 
public expense when an election is 
approaching, New York state's has 
no such restrictions.

lFriends' Stars to Get $750,000 per Episode 
Under pressure to accept more 

than $40 million a year each or face 
cancellation of their series. the stars 
of the NBC comedy "Friendsw 
agreed Sunday to a deal that would 
bring the show back for two more 
seasons. 

The six stars of the show - Lisa 
Kudrow, Courteney Cox Arquette, 
Jennifer Aniston, David 
Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and 
Matt leBlanc - had demanded 
annual salaries of more than $1 
million an episode, plus added 
profits from the show's sales in 
syndication. In the end, after what 
several executives involved in the 
talks described as complicated and 
occasionally frantic negotiations, 
the stars wound up accepting 
$750,000 an episode for the next 

two seasons of 24 episodes each, as 
well as a higher percentage of 
future profits in the show. 

The deals will be worth more 
than $40 million a year for each of 
the stars. twG executives invol9ed in 
the negotiations said. Even though 
this represents a total far in excess of 
what any of the stars could possibly 
command to appear in movies, the 
deal came closer to not happening 
than anyone had expected. . 

The stars' demands had pushed 
NBC and Warner Brothers, the stu-
dio that owns "Friends: to threat-
en to drop what is now television's 
highest-rated comedy. 

NBC, which had to lock in a 
new fall prime-time schedule by 
Sunday night in anticipation of a 
formal announcement to national 

advertisers Monday, told represen-
tatives of the stars that if a deal was 
not done by 3 p.m. Sunday, 
"Friendsw would be canceled. 

"The pressure had to build 
before a deal could be done: said 
Peter Roth, the president of the 
Warner Brothers television studio, 
a unit of Time Warner. The deal 
was finally completed at 3 a.m. 
Sunday. Roth said. 

He said it was in many ways typ-
ical of tough negotiations that need 
a deadline before they are resolved. 
He added: "There's no question 
that there was a period of lime last 
week when things were really 
shaky. NBC was really clear that 
they would remove the show." .

ContInued from ...,. 1 
duction assistant for the show, 
found the event particularly 
meaningful. 

"Filipinos are the largest Asian 
group in San Diego: Villegas said. 
"Even though when people think 
of Asians, they think predomi-
nantly Chinese, Korean or 
Japanese ... We're not out here to 
change your opinion, but to give 
you a change to have an opinion: 

Many scenes offered com men-

tary on the unfair stereotypes that 
have been ascribed to the Filipino 
American community. 
Coordinators of PCC asserted that 
the purpose of presenting these 
unflattering portrayals was to poke 
fun at stereotypes through satire. 

"We wanted to promote posi-
tive images of Filipino Americans 
while erasing negative ones: 
Villegas said. 

Joanne Bundalian, cultural 
dance coordinator and director of 
the event, offered her thoughts on 
choreographing the show. 

"[We attempted) to mix past 
and present parts of our culture, 
even if only in our minds: 
Bundalian said. "To poryay the

what encompass our show." 

According to Catherine 
Deguzman, head coordinator of 
the event, putting PCC together 
was a unique challenge. 

"Words are not enough to 
describe this PeC experience and 
the spectrum of emotions and 
adventures I have gone through 
because of it: Deguzman said. "In 
retrospect, this experience has been 
a bittersweet challenge, but despite 
all the hardships. I managed to fall 
in love ... in love with the cast, the 
concept and the message."

Hearing to Evaluate 
UC Berkeley Research 
State Senate to investigate deal made with private 
pharmaceutical and genetic engineering company 
., ANNI BINJAMINSON 
Dally Californian 

(O-WlRE) BERKELEY. Calif. -
The University of California-
Berkeley's College of Natural 
Resources' deal with a private 
pharmaceutical and genetic engi-
neering company will be the focus 
of a California state Senate hearing 
Monday, in which the effect of pri-
vate funding on public research 
will be evaluated. 

State Sen. Tom Hayden, a 
Democrat from Los Angeles, called 
the hearing in part to examine the 
alliance. Under the agreement, 
Novartis, a Swiss corporation, gave 
$25 million to the college. In 
exchange, Novartis would be given 
two seats on the college's five-per-
son research committee and the 
right to negotiate licenses on many 
of the college's research findings. 

"[The deal) raises significant . 
questions of whether biotechnology 
research priinarily serves the inter-
ests of corporations and marginal-
izes potential academic critics at the 
expense of free inquiry and unfet-
tered research: Hayden said in a 
message concerning the hearing. 

In addition, UC Berkeley'S 
Graduate Assembly has called for a 
termination of the agreement with 
Novartis. 

David Friedman, the assembly's 
president, said yesterday the organi-
zation was wonied about the agree-
ment's effect on graduate students 
conducting research and on the 
entire reputation of the university. 

"We're not taking the stand just 
because it hurts graduate students: 

Friedman said . "We're taking the 
stand because it hurts the public.· 

Professors and graduate students 
dependent on private funds might 
skew their research in the interests 
of ovartis, Friedman said. 

"The fear is there might come a 
time where research won't be dis-
closed because it is adverse to the 
company that funded the research: 
he said. "The reasons graduate stu-
dents come here is so we can do our 
research free of influence." 

Monday's hearing in 
Sacramento is expected to include 
testimony from several key figures 
within the college. Dean Gordon 
Rausser, who is expected to appear 
before the Senate in favor of the 
agreement, was not available for 
comment yesterday. 

Miguel Altieri, one of the col-
lege'S professors. will also give tes-
timony at the hearing. which is 
before the Senate's Natural 
Resources Committee and Select 
Committee on Higher Education. 
While the hearing is intended to 
address the broader impacts of 
genetic engineering on the 
California environment, it will 
open with testimony concerning 
the Novartis agreement. 

AJthough recent polls show a 
majority of the faculty oppose the 
deal, Altieri added many were afraid 
to voice their opinions. 

"There are a lot of people who 
are afraid of talking about this 
issue: he said. "They don't want to 
oppose the dean, and I think there 
is a certain level of faculty being 
afraid of speaking out on whatever 
way they think."

cuss my company value, 
I am the majori ty share-
holder, and many of our 
competitors have gone 
through the IPO process 
and are now publicly 
traded on the Nasdaq: 
Agarwal said . 

Agarwal feels that his 
product is what sets him 
apart from competitors. 

"What differentiates 
us from the competition 
is our specialization in 
Internet stocks and the 
stock offerings we put in 
front of our users: 

house employees at the main office near 
University Town Centre, and nearly 100 peo-
ple are involved in the project altogether. 

ISN provides its users with access to free 
real-time stock quotes, message boards and 
chats with industry professionals, as well as 
real-time market analysiS and commentary. 
Fifteen analysts and writers contribute to give 
clients the latest market data, updates and 
news. 

"ISN boasts unique items such as access 
to public and private investment opportuni-
ties in early stage Internet companies. as well 
as a proprietary and actively managed 'ones

analyst believes will outperform the market,"

Most ISN users have an annual house-

more than $10 million in 1999, and now has

system to allow for larger stake and more 
complex ventures." 

Agarwal enjoys the real-world experience 
he has been able to gain while still in school. 
The university tends to focus on the theoret-
ical side of learning rather than providing 
students with practical applications for their 
knowledge. The programming, Web design, 
Internet security law and Internet-based 
marketing that he learns at work are more 
than he could have learned from any course. 

Agarwal openly admits he is not an ideal 
student. 

"I am the epitome of an ADD case: 
Agarwal said. "I always fall asleep in class so 
I have to do other things to compensate. 
Being CEO of Internet Stock News has allowed 
me to miss class on a more consistent basis."

makes Agarwal a very busy man. The relaxed

The Editor's Soapbox 
By filing suit against Napster, Metallica, Dr. Dre and the Recording Institute of America show their ignorance 
By DAVID PlLZ 
Associate Photo Editor 

Last week, Lars Ulrich, drum-
mer of metal band Metallica, 
walked into the Napster offices in 
San Mateo, Calif., to drop off an 
amendment to the band's lawsuit 
against the company. 

On May 4, Metallica delivered a 
list of 317,377 user names of peo-
ple who were giving away Metallica 
MP3s via Napster and demanded 
that Napster cut off service to these 
people. saying that these people 
infringed on the band's copyright. 

apster complied. 
Metallica are not the only olles 

suing Napster - Dr. Dre and The 
Recording Industry of America 
have also filed lawsuits. 

apster is a program that allows 
users to download MP3s, a type of 
sound file, from the Internet. 
People logging into Napster have 
their MP3s put into a central data-
base for others to access and 
download. This group of people 
can access each other'S music 
banks and download their favorite 
songs This is why it is called the 
Napstcr Music Community. 

N <lP ter currently is ve ry con-
troversial, due to the fact that it has 
been banned on many campuses in 
the country, including UCSD. The 
ust' of • apster can be examined 
from both a fi nancial standpoint 
and an ethical one. 

Those sUing Napster argue that 
MP3 technol gy, and programs 
that make it easy to download 
MP3s. have made a strong financial 
Impa t on them because anyone 
wanting to have more music in 

their library can now download the 
music for free. This denies record 

. companies and artists the royalties 
they receive from purchases. 

However, I fail to see how MP3s 
make any financial impact on the 
music industry. In fact, recording 
ind'CIstry profits rose by 8 percent 
last year, but let's take a closer look 
at the situation. 

First, let's get one thing straight. 
Mpeg layer three files are inferior 
to CD quality. The great thing 
about MP3s is that they have a rel-
atively small file size, as opposed to 
.wav files, which have better quality 
but an extremely large file size. The 
quality of the sound depends on 
the bitrate (sampling rate) - as the 
bitrate gets larger, the quality 
increases, but so does the file size. 

I don't know anyone who uses 
MP3s as an alternative to CDs. I do, 
however, know many people 
(including myself) who have down-
loaded MP3s then have bought the 
album. It is a great medium for 
bands to get their music out there 
for people to hear and decide if 
they like it. 

For many people, the presence or 
absence of MP3s has not affected 
thei r willingness to buy a CD. Many 
people have MP3s on their comput-
er that include random songs from 
here and there. Although they may 
enjoy listening to them, they do not 
like them enough to buy the CD. To 
argue that a band would make more 
money if apster technology was 
eliminated is to fail to see the big 
picture. 

From a purely financial point of 
view, there doesn't seem to be any-
thing wrong With this: Some may 

I do not think music 
belangs to anyone. Of 
course artists should get 
compensated for their 
work. Usualry they are, 
and I believe very 
generous!)'. However, to 
hold onto a product so 
tight!)' and charge 
ridiculous prices seems 
wrong to me. This sends a 
message to all about what 
they care about most. 
argue that it is wrong because the 
listener has not purchased the priv-
ilege to own the music and to listen 
to it at their convenience. 

I do not think music belongs to 
anyone. Of course artists should 
get compensated for their work. 
Usually they are, and I believe very 
generously. However. to hold onto 
a product so tightly and charge 

ridiculous prices seems wrong to 
me. This sends a message to all 
about what they care about most. 

Those suing Napster do not 
understand the Internet well 
enough and are too quick to fight 
against it rather than 'work with it. 

Metallica and Dr. Ore should 
see MP3 technology as a way of 
getting their music heard by the 
public. rather than a force against 
them. In an interview on Salon.com 
with Eileen Richardson, chief exec-
utive officer of Napster, she said 
she believes that artists resisting 
MP3 technology are simply unfa-
miliar with the technology. 

"I think (Metallica and the 
recording industry'sl actions are 
based on a lack of knowledge and 
fear: Richardson said. "When 
you're afraid of something that you 
don't understand, you react, usually 
with a lawsuit. It just shows, though, 
that they're not that familiar yet with 
the Internet as a medium. They're 
unfamiliar with how their fans are 
using it, and how it could benefit 
the band in the future." 

Napster is a way for bands to 
attract more fans, and a great one at 
that. In addition, I think a lot of 
good new bands will benefit from 
this technology. Non-mainstream 
bands can use apster or MP3 
technology to mass distribute their 
work, and widen their demograph-
ic appeal. 

Currently, the main ways most 
people hear new music are through 
the radio and television, both of 
which I am no ~ven going to get 
started on. Rlch .. rdson said she 
likes her product because it allows 
patrons Co listen to exactly what 

they want and avoid the "bubble-
gum hits." 

"I don't have time to sit in front 
of MTV for two hours and get 
blasted with whatever somebody 
decided to blast me with, and it's 
the same with radio, ff Richardson 
said. "Whereas online, I can sit 
down and say, 'Hey, these are the 
things I like, give me more,'" On 
the Napster Web site you can get 
information , base'd on musicians 
that you like, of other musicians 
that you might like. 

There are many bands out there 
who are pro-MP3 and have spoken 
out in defense of Napster. These 
include Chuck D., Limp Bizkit and 
The Offspring. 

This attack against Napster is, 
in essence, an attack agamst the 
younger users of the Internet. 
MP3s are used mostly by people 
our age or younger, the bulk of 
whom are probably in high school. 
Getting a message from apster 
saying that Metallica monitored 
you and has made us cu t off service 
to you is sending a strong message 
to younger users, creating unnec-
essary fear. 

There is one more thing that 
must be understood. If ap ter 
loses in court and gets shut down 
for good, this will not be the end. 
There are currently many other 
ways to download MP3s, and many 
more Will come. When It comes to 
the Internet, if there is demand, 
there will be supply, no matter what 
the regulation may b . 

Richardson believes MP3s give 
people greater access to musicians

Re Viewing the Web 
Internet travel fJteb pages provide a multitude of options, from one-stop shopping to corporate-owned sites 
• , JESSICA SCHIPPMANN 
Features Editor 

For students, summer vacation 
conjures up hopes of touring 
Europe and sleeping in youth hos-
tels with people from all over the 
world. Visiting remote islands and 
learning about native customs 
becomes an effort to be not just a 
student in a university. but a stu-
dent of the world. 

Realistically, however. student 
travel is difficult. Planning. cost 
and organization all contribute to 
difficulties that can mean spending 
another summer wasting one's 
youth working for the man. rather 
than experiencing life. Where 
should a student begin? 

because its format requires stu-
dents to pick a price they are will-
ing to pay, and then hand over a 
cr('dit card number and hope for 
the best. Usually, within one hour 
of giving Priceline.com this infor-
mation, someone will e-mail a con-
firmation of a purchase that most 
closely resembles the parameters 
the user established.

On the search for summer 
excitment. the Internet now pro-
vides many opponunities for stu-
dents to make reservations with 
airli nes. hotels or hostels, plan 
adventures. and explore potential 
destinations through cyberspace. 
Some of these si tes are hits. while 
others are big misses. For making 
airline reservations, two Web sites. 
Travelocity.com and Priceline.com 
give two different options for buy-
ing tickets. 

Purchasers are not given the 
opponunity to peruse selections 
and then pick the best one for 
them. This makes ticket purchas-
ing and other reservations awk-
ward. Rather then just looking for 
the cheapest airline tickets available 
online, users must enter the price 
they are willing to pay. This means 
that if there are no tickets available. 
users must go through this process 
over and over again, increasing the 
amount they are willing to spend in 
tiny increments. If a user is too 
generous with his or her offer, they 
will never know they paid too 
much. 

CD ,.,..... ."I"ke Various Web site l'ttIJiln-s offer one-stop shopping convenitna for travellers who want to rrstrve 
airline ticUts. Eurorail passes. maJce hotel or hostel reservations and chtclc out their planned vacation destination- aU on one 
Web site. 

These two Web sites merged in 
a marketing alliance in April to 
offer users more choices, with two 
different approaches to purchas-
ing. Priceline.com's theme is 
"Name your own pric~ for airline 
tickets. hotel rooms. groceries. 
new cars. home finance and save'" 
The site calls this a "demand col-
lection system." 

This is a nice concept, however. 
Priceline.com is problematic 

Price line. com finds the tickets 
that are closest to the price 
offered, not necessarily the cheap- . 
est price, or the best value - a 
severe disadvantage. Furthermore, 
those buying airline or other trav-
el tickets, or making hotel reserva-
tions, are not given the advantage 
of a wide selection of choices. The 
main advantage to Priceline.com is 
that it does not require member-
ship from its users. However. this 
factor is negligible in comparison 
with the hassles - such as those 
described above - that users 
must endure. 

Additionally, Priceline.com 
does not offer services to those 

users who would like to make 
hotel reservations outside of the 
United States or Canada. 

For students, the better Web site 
for purchasing airline tickets is 
Thlvelocity.com. This Web site is 
appreciated by users because it 
gIves a wider range of choices and 
is especially useful for students 
traveling abroad. A free member-
ship gives users access to services 
from a number of differtnt airlines, 
increasing the odds of getting a 
fairly priced ticket. 

"Travelocity.com provides ... 
reservations capabilities for 9S per-
cent of all airline seats sold, more 
than 47.000 hotels, more than 50 
car rental companies and more

than S,OOO vacation and cruise 
packages," states the company's 
Web site. 

Thlvelocity.com gives access to a 
vast database of destination and 
travel information and has more 
than 17 million members. 

Rather than offering fairly 
priced groceries such as 
PriceIine.com to attract cus-
tomers, Travelocity.com offers 
destination guides, services to 
make car rent:ll reservations, and 
also allows users to explore vaca-
tion packages and cruise packages. 
This Web site also includes fea-
tured packages, featured destina-
tions and trip repons to give trav-
elers more infonnation on their 

destinations, information on spe-
cial deals and an opponunity to 
make multiple reservations from 
one Web site. 

The Online Vacation Mall at 
www.onlinevacationmall.com also 
provides a service where registered 
users can access "e-specials· and 
discounted rates for hotels and 
airline tickets. Unfortunately, this 
site only allows reservations to be 
made in the United States or 
Canada. 

A significant limitation of all of 
these Web sites is that they are 
geared toward older travelers.

Collegetravelers.com is a new

older travelers, but is "esigned with 
students in mind . It does not 
require membership to use, making 
it especially convenient. 

"This ... has been created espe-

Collegetravelers.com claims to 

allow users to purchase Eurorail 
passes, reserve rental cars and 
even has a program to help stu-
dents plan their travel budgets. As 
with any vacation services, it is 
best to confirm reservations 
directly with the airline, hotel, 
hostel or other service provider of 
your choice. 

Mainstream Internet organiza-
tions also offer travel sites. 
Yahoo.com, at 
www.travel.yahoo.com. offers infor-
mation about almost any destina-
tion a traveler could be seeking. in 
addition to opponunities for 
making reservations at hotels and 
with airlines. 

As with other Web sites. Yahoo 
asks users to establish a free 
membe'rship before using its ser-
vices. Yahoo offers ticket specials 
at www.jlycheap.com. According to 
the site, the free membership 
allows users access to a range of 
choices. Members enter their 
desired destination. departure 
dates and the price they are will-
ing to pay. 

Flycheap.com then pres!=nts 
users with a variety of choices -
that are actually available. It also 
claims to include an estimate of 
taXes so that the user will not be 
surprised with additional fees upon 
payment.

appreciated by students traveling 
on a limited budget because they 
provide cheap, clean accommoda-

the world, including in all 50 
states. Overnight fees average 
between $8 and $17, and hostels 
allows people (usually students) 
from around the world to come 
together in a dormitory setting to 
exchange travel stories. 

Airlines, such as United 
Airlines, Southwest Airlines and 
Delta Airlines all have their own 
individual Web sites as well where 
travelers can check out the deals 
offered. The disadvantage to these 
corpon:.te-owned Web sites is that 
they do not have the competjtive 
edge that one-stop shopping Web 
sites do. They won't necessarily 
look for the best deal, but you will 
be able to guarantee a brand name 
plane ticket. 

With all of the Web sites, be 
aware of reservation fees. Certain 
sites may charge small (or large) 
prices for the convenience of 
usi ng their site. Additional charges 
may be made by the company they

Tennis: 
Women leave western 
foes in their dust 
ConU.ed fro. ..... 24 
closer. Tadlock and her 
opponent Brook Calton, 
from Claremont, were tied at 
five before Tadlock broke 
Calton and held her serve to 
take the set 7-5 . 

No. 6 singles featured 
Gunther taking on Glencora 
Pontee from Claremont. 
Gunther escaped a tightly 
contested first set with a 7-5 
victory and stepped up her 
game a notch in the second 
set. Gunther's improved play 
proved to be too much for 
Ponlee, and the result was a 
6-2 victory. 

The most exciting match 
of the day was at No. 5 sin-
gles, where Liao took on 
Jirika Peterson from 
Claremont. Liao took the 
first set in easy fashion by a 
score of 6-2, but Peterson 
came back to win the sec-
ond set 6-4. Instead of play-
ing .. third set, the teams 
agreed to play a tiebreaker 
to 10 because the overall 
result of the match had 
already been decided in 
UCSD's favor. In the super 
tiebreaker, Peterson took an 
early lead and held on to 
defeat Liao 10-5 to take the 
match. 

UCSD will take its west-
ern regional crown to 
Minnesota next weekend 
when it competes on the 
campus of Gustavus 
Adolphus College in th e 

CAA ational 
Championship Tournament. 
Gustavus Adolphus will be 
UCSD's first opponent.

Short: 
Tritons run out of gas 
against Redlands 
ContInued frOlll pep 20 
point. 

The Tritons entered singles 
competition, as they did in their 
previous matchup with Claremont, 
with a 1-0 lead. Unlike the last 
match up, however, the 'llitons did 
not fold in singles and went on to 
take four of the six singles matches 
to secure the match. 

Meyer played No. 1 singles and 
took on Matt Sizemore from 
Claremont. The first set was highly 
contested, but Meyer got a late 
break of serve off Sizemore, taking 
the set 7-5. In the second set, 
Meyer made an early break stand 
up and went on to take the set 6-3. 

Albrecht, the Thitons' No. 1 
player in Meyer'S absence, played 

o. 2 and took on Locky 
Chambers from Claremont. 
Albrecht found his match up with 
Chambers more favorable than 
his duel with Sizemore. In that 
match, Albrecht lost a three-set 
game, but this time around he 
dominated from beginning to end, 
taking the set 6-3, 6-2 . 

The match at l' o. 3 singles pit-
ted Rosen against Adam Short 
from Claremont. In the first set, 
Short's serve and volley game was 
too much for Rosen, propelling a 
6-2 win. 

The second set was a 180-
degree turn from the first -
Rosett dominated in every area. 
Rosen broke Short three straight 
times and rolled to a 6-0 vic"tory, 

forcing a third set. The third set 
was much the same as the first 
and the score was identical, with 
Short winning 6-2. 

No. 4 singles was a thriller 
between Sean Higginbotham 
from UCSD and Brett 
Shepardson from Claremont. The 
two split the first two sets, with 
Higginbotham winning the first 
and Shepardson the second. The 
third set was also tightly contest-

"I knew getting 
[Meyer] back would 
help us a lot. It also 
helped that our guys 
competed well, " 

illeSt......,. 
Men's tennis head coach 

ed, with Shepardson taking it 6-3 
to win the match. 

Ryan Thompson played at No. 
5 singles for the Tritons and won 
the first set 7-5 with a late break of 
serve. That break gave Thompson 
the momentum heading into the 
second set - he used that 
momentum to roll 6-1 in the set, 
winning the match. 

Nagle had no problems at No. 
6 singles. taking the match 6-4, 6-
2. Nagle lost his match at No. 6 
singles in two sets the previous 
times the two teams played. 

The win propelled the 'llitons 
into the title match, where they 
played Redlands University. 
UCSD had lost to Redlands earli-
er this season, but had been 
aching for a rematch . When

UCSD got it, the results were not 
what the team expected. 

UCSD got off to a good start, 
winning two of the three doubles 
prosets to take a 1-0 lead in the 
match. As in the match with 
Claremont, the teams of Albrecht 
and Rosett and Meyer and 
Thompson came through with 
victories that gave UCSD the early 
lead. 

"I was really excited when we 
won doubles because we didn't 
win it the last time. we played 
them: Steidlmayer said. "I knew 
we had to win that if we Wfre 
going to have a chance to win the 
match ." 

The Tritons had no idea that 
the doubles point would be the 
only point they would win all day. 
Redlands dominated the Tritons 
in singles, winning all six matches. 
This was especially disappointing 
because UCSD won the first set at 
the top three singles spots and 
looked to be rolling toward a vic-
tory. 

Redlands has been a thorn in 
UCSD's side. Losses to Redlands 
have ensured UCSD's exclusion 
from the CAA National 
Championships the last four years. 

"I was a Iinle disappointed in 
our bottom half: Steidlmayer 
said. "They competed well but 
they just didn't perform that well. 
That's going to happen from 
sometimes." 

In spite of the disappointing 
loss, the Thitons look forward to 
next year. The core of their team 
is returning, and they look to 
have a good shot to be successful 
when UCSD moves to Division 
II next year. 

Softball: 
Revenge quest against 
Chapman comes up short 

shut down the La Verne bats and 
UCSD escaped with a 5-4 victory 
and lived to see the second day of 
the tournament. 

With that win under their belt, 
the Tritons faced Trinity 
University Saturday morn-
ing for the right to play 
Chapman in the finals of 
the losers bracket. 

Things were look-
ing shaky for the 
Tritons when Harlan 
allowed a run in the 
second inning that put 
UCSD down 1-0. In the 
fourth inning, when 
doubts were starting to creep into 
the collective head of the UCSD 
faithful, Marcella DiMichieli came 
through. with a clutch two-run 
single to give the Tritons a 2-1 
lead. Harlan took it from there and 
recorded three consecutive score-
less innings to give the Tritons the 
win. The victory put the lritons in 
the finals of the losers bracket. 

Saturday afternoon was the 
backdrop for the rematch 
between UCSD and Chapman 
University. Chapman had beaten 
the Thitons twice just twO weeks 
ago and took the No.1 ranking in 
the western region away from 
UCSD. Redemption was certainly 
on the minds of the Triton players 
and coaching staff. 

"We wanted to be playing 
Chapman in the finals of the region 

Monday, May 15, 2000 

but we ended up playing them in 
the finals of the losers bracket," 
Gerkens said. "Revenge was defi-
nitely on our minds." 

Chapman's offense was helped 
out in the first inning when sun 
glare caused a pop fly to drop to the 

~ound, plating two runs and giv-
109 Chapman an ear:y 2-0 lead. 
Chapman put up another two runs 
in the fourth inning and began to 
smell victory when it retired the 
Tritons with the bases loaded in the 
second and third innings. The 

Tritons got on the board with 
an RBI single by Wilson in 
the fifth inning, but it 

was not nearly enough 
and Chapman cruised 
into the final of the 
tournament with a 4-1 

victory that sent the 
Thitons home for the sum-

mer. 
Wilson led the Tritons on 

offense all tournament long. She 
had eight hits and four RBis in 14 
plate appearances. 

"Michelle was incredible all 
tournament long: Gerkens said. 
·She was seeing the ball well the 
entire time." 

Despite failing to r:each nation-
als, the Tritons had a superior sea-
son, largely catalyzed by the self-
lessness of many of the team mem-
bers. This selflessness was exempli-
fied by No. 2 starter Erin 
Flannigan, who graciously stepped 
aside when Gerkens chose to start 
Harlan in all four games. 

If they can keep that kind of 
attitude and continue with it next 
season, we can expect bright 
things from the Tritons for years 
to come.

Harper's water Polo Team Will Start 
2000 Season Without Five Seniors 
Mecham, Wagenbrenner, Bey, Dandy and Silvestri say good-bye 
!lyBlU., ... 
Sports Editor 

Despite the fact that the end of 
the year left something to be 
desired, the UCSD men's water 
polo team wrapped up one of the 
most phenomenal seasons in the 
school's history in 1999 when it 
lost in the consolation game of the 
national Final Four to the 
University of Massachusetts. 

The success that the team 
experienced in 1999 and for the 

~ast four year~ was due greatly to 
ItS five departing seniors. And y 
Wagenbrenner, Gordon Bey, 
Andrew S}lvestri, Ryan Dandy and 
Ross Mecham are all saying good-
bye to UCSD and Head Coach 
Dennis Harper after their incredi-
ble careers at the school. 
. D.espite not getting much play-
Ing lime, Wagenbrenner was a bal-
ancing force for the last two years. 

."He really brought stability to 
our practices by pushing the other 
goalies to be their best: Harper 
said . ."It is important to have those 
guys." 

Wagenbrenner went out for 
baseball when he was a freshman, 
but Harper voictd wishes that he 
had started in water polo. 

Gordon Bey was one of three 
Tritons to play all four years for 
UCSD and made big contributions 
all four seasons. 

"[Beyl was one of the smartest 
athletes ever to play for the athlet-
ics department: Harper said. "I will 
always remember him for hitting 
some big shots in his career and for 
his phenomenal swimming ability. 
[Beyl had double-digit goal and 
assist statistics all four years at the 

school." 
Bey plans to attend medical 

school in fall . 
Silvestri will always be remem-

bered for the work ethic he showed 
during his time at UCSD. 

"When Andy came here, he was 
a noncontributor, and I wondered 
if he was going to be able to con-
tinue to make the team: Harper 
said. "During his career he worked 
harder then anyone I have ever 
seen and ended up being a team 
captain his senior year and making 
huge contributions his final two 
seasons." 

Silvestri was among the team 
leaders in steals in 1998 and 1999 
and was always tough on the 
defensive end, where his hard work 
paid off greatly. Silvestri will be 
attending graduate school in the 
fall. 

Dandy's UCSD career was only 
two short years, but he made his 
mark during that time. 

"[Dandyl was a no-nonsense 
player with an intense approach to 
the game: Harper said. "For a 
junior college guy who was only 
here two seasons, his contributions 
were phenomenal." 

In Dandy's first season, he 
recorded 37 goals and 17 assists, 
both of which were good enough 
for fourth on the team. Dandy's 
consistent play continued into his 
senior season, when he was again 
among the top of all offensive cate-
gories for the Tritons. Dandy will 
return to Orange County after 
graduation. 

Mecham's name has come to be 
synonymous with UCSD water 
polo and it will be strange to not 
see him in the water next season. 

"If there was a Thiton athletics 
hall of fame, Ross would be in it 
for sure: Harper said. "The first 
thing that comes to my mimf is, 
'My god, how will we ever replace 
this guy?' The truth is that we 
won't because you can't replace a 
guy like that." 

Mecham's accomplishments are 
truly staggering. As a freshman, he 
was second in goals behind fellow 
superstar Romas Kudirka and also 
second on the team in steals. During 
his four-year career at UCSD, 
Mecham was never below second 011 
the team in either steals or goals and 
he recorded over 50 goals in both his 
junior and senior seasons. 

Mecham's accomplishments 
went far beyond statistics. 

"He was the two-time Division 
111 player of the year and WWPA 
player of the year, but he was a lot 
more than that: Harper said. "He 
was incredibly enthusiastic and had 
some special leadership qualities 
that you rarely see." 

After graduation, Mecham 
plans to travel to Australia and go 
to Hawaii to see the WWPA cham-
pionships, which UCSD again 
should be the favorite to win. 

Despite losing all sorts of talent, 
Harper is optimistic for the future. 

"I have come to realize that 
UCSD is a great school and it 
attracts some great kids," Harper 
said. "That is why I keep coming 
back here." 

Look for Harper's squad to be • 
in competition for another Final 
Four birth in the 2000 season. 
Even with many of his leaders 
graduating, Harper's team looks 
strong and going into the 2000 
campaign.

Losing did in Knight, 
not his temper 
1Iy1lU._ 

As an avid University of Indiana 
fan, it pains me to say this, but 
men's basketball Head Coach Bob 
Knight has worn out his welcome 
in Hoosier country. 

The latest allegations against 
Knight involve verbally berating a 
64-year-old secretary and breaking 
his son's nose on a camping trip. 
When sports fans hear these sto-
ries, it is almost impossible to 
understand how Knight has been 
allowed to stay in his positions long 
as he has. 

Indiana officials may cry that 
they had no knowledge of the kind 
of torment Knight put his players 
and other people around him 
through, but I beg to differ. They, 
and the general public, have 
known for years about Knight's 
abuse of power, but they allowed 
him to continue. The question is, 
why? 

To understand, one has to have 
seen the environment that Knight 
lives in . I lived in Indiana, and one 
of my most vivid memories is that 
basketball is the local deity in 
every high school gym and neigh-
borhood driveway. There is noth-
ing in California that even com-
pares to the kind of craze that 
Indiana basketball conjures up in 
the state. 

Another thing about this situa-
tion that disturbs me is the press 
release that Knight released to 
explain his actions. In this release, 
Knight admitted to a temper prob-
lem and said he was sorry and he 
would work on solving the prob-
lem. 

Knight is obviously following 
Bill Clinton's lead with this very 
heartfelt apology. Knight isn't 
sorry for his temper. If he were, he 
would have worked to solve the 
problem a long time ago. What he 
is sorry about is that all of his 
actions are now coming to light, 
and he is soon going to be out of a 
job because of his behavior.' He 
has been asked about his temper 
countless times in the past, and 
his answer is always the same. He 
always says he is trying to make 
his players as good as they can 
possibly be, and he will do any-
thing to achieve that goal. Now all 
of the sudden he is sorry? Yeah 
right. 

I am not a ba~ketball coach, but 
I think that if I grabbed a player by 
the throat or punched my son in 
the nose, I would know that I had a 
severe anger-management prob-
lem. Knight and the rest of the 
nation's basketball fans knew 
about his problem, but three 
National Championships seemed 
to make everybody forget it. Now 
that Indiana basketball hit a seven-
year drought, all of this is coming 
to light. This is not a coincidence. 

To a certain extent, I feel sorry 
for Knight. He is like many ath-
letes today who are treated like 
kings until they become expend-
able and are then promptly kicked 
out onto the street. Within one 
week, that is where Knight will be, 
and the rest of us will be forced to 
wonder what his most egregious 
crime was in the eyes of the pow-
ers that be at Indiana University. 
Was it his temper or his inability 
to maintain a winning program? 
The timeliness of his firing points 
to the latter.

Tennis Takes West Region 
Women's tennis team defeats Claremont College to win the regional championship 
By DD YOUNG 
Staff Writer 

All season the Thtons have been 
the juggernaut of the western region 
in women's tennis. On Saturday, 
they put their No.1 ranking on the 
line when they played Claremont 
College. UCSD hardly broke a sweat 
in the match, rolling to a 7-2 victo-
ry. 

"We had just played them a few 
weeks ago and had a similar score," 
Head Coach Liz LaPlante said. "We 
definitely expected to defeat them 
again." 

Claremont faced off against 
Redlands University on Friday for 
the right to play the Thtons on 
Saturday. In that match, Claremont 
escaped with a 6-3 victory, in ~ 
because of a tough win by Blair 
Rubenstein at No. 1 singles. 
However, by the end of Saturday, 
Claremont probably wished it had 
not won the day before. 

On Saturday, the Thtons took 
advantage of the fact that their legs 
were fresh and ran their opponents 
aU over the court. 

"I know a few of their girls had 
long. three-set matches on Friday 
and that probably worked to our 
advantage,· LaPlante said. "Even

Softball Eliminated By 
Chapman University 
Bitter rival defeats UCSD for the third time 
this season to eliminate them from Regionals 
IIyDIIYOUN8 
51 af( Writer 

With time running out in the 
softball season, the UCSD soft-
ball team traveled to Hart Park 
in Orange, Calif. this weekend to 
compete in the Western Region 
Championships. Tpe Tritons 
went into the contest as the 
third-seeded team, but unfortu-
nately left the tournament when 
they lost to Chapman University 
in the finals of the losers brack-
et. In their first game, 
the Tritons played against 
Washington's Pacific Lutheran 
University. 

Their opponents were unfa-
miliar to most Thton fans, but 
Head Coach Patti Gerkens knew 
what her squad was up against. 

"I knew they were going to be 
a good team because I had seen 
them play once before,· Gerkens 
said. "They ended up being even 
better than I remembered.· 

The Tritons had problems 
with their opponents from the 
beginning. PLU scored two runs 
in the first inning off starting 
pitcher Leta Harlan and never 

looked back, After an RBI single 
by Michelle Wilson cut the PLU 
in half, the lritons' opponent 
exploded for six runs in the fifth 
inning to up UCSD away. The 
rally was capped with a home run 
by PLU first baseman Tharen 
Michael. The Tritons were unable

fell 8-1. 

The loss put UCSD in the 
losers bracket and within one 
defeat of going home. 

In their second game, the 
Tritons took on La Verne 
University. UCSD got off to a 
good start in the second inning 
when it put five runs on the 
board. The 5-0 lead looked insur-
mountable and the Tritons began 
to relax. That is when La Verne 
struck, scoring two runs in the 
third and two more in the fourth, 
cutting the Thtons' lead to a sin-
gle run.

we kind of relaxed,· Gerkens said. 
"We couldn't get the momentum 
back after that.·

The UCSD men's tennis team 
season has been a seesaw affair to 
say the least. 

It started out promising. with 
two new recruits, Michael 
Meyer and Corey Moderhak, 
playing one and two singles. 
Then,·balfway through the year, 
things hit a low point when 
Moderhak was declared ineligi-
ble and Meyer suffered an arm 
injury. 

Meyer healed in time for the 
Western Regional 
Championship this weelcend, 
where UCSD took on the 
Claremont Colleges for the right 
to play Redlands in the champi-
onship match. The Tritons 
avenged a 1-6 loss to Claremont 
earlier in the year with a 5-2 vic-
tory on Friday, but eventually 
fell 6-1 to Redlands University 
in the finals. 

The team knew it was in for a 
tough match on Friday. The 
Thtons hid lost 1-6 just two

on UCSD's nonh courts. 

However, that was before the 
return of Meyer, whose reappear-
ance enabled the team to play one 
spot lower in the lineup than 
before. The Tritons used this 
advanta$e to tum a 1-6 defeat in 
the previOUS match into a 5-2 win 
this time around. 

"I knew getting (Meyer) back 
would help us a lot,· Head Coach 
Eric Steidlmayer said. "It also 
helped that our guys really com-
peted well.· 

In doubles, the Thtons won 
two of three presets, just as they 
did in the previous match. At No. 
1 doubles, Dan Albrecht and 
Mike Rosett won 8-5. This was 
the closest of the three doubles 
bouts between the two teams. At 
No. 2 doubles, Joe Diehl and 
Sean Nagle never got the 
momentum rolling. falling quick-
ly by a score of 8-3. 

Meyer and Ryan Thompson 
teamed up at No. 3 doubles and 
were in control of the match from 
beginning to end. Their 8-4 vic-
tory gave the Tritons the win in 
doubles and the sole doubles
