When life gives you kidney stones, 
drink lemonade. 

That’s according to a UCSD study 
showing that lemonade can prevent 
the growth of kidney stones due to its 
high concentration of citrate, a natural 
inhibitor against stone formation. 

Kidney stones form when minerals 
become too concentrated in urine and 
crystallize in the kidneys. 

Roger Sur, director of UCSD’s 
Comprehensive Kidney Stone Center, 
conducted an experiment in which 
patients drank two liters of water — 
which had four ounces of lemon juice 
— twice daily for two months. 

“Lemonade’s been an anecdote for 
quite some time,” Sur said. “Our study 
specifically looked at how it can actu-
ally prevent stone formation.”

The study, conducted on par-
ticipants who had a history of kidney 
stones, confirmed that lemonade 
increases citrate levels in the urine. 
Since citrate prevents stone formation 
by raising the pH of urine and buffer-
ing it from becoming strongly acidic, 
the lemonade works to prevent the 
kidney stones. 

“The two big outcomes were that 
one, for people with low citrate levels, 
[lemonade] was a good method to 
increase those levels and, number two: 
decreased the amount of oxalate, and 
so, most importantly, the formation 
rate of kidney stones,” Sur said.

At the end of the study, X-ray 
imaging and citrate level tests demon-
strated that the lemonade had reduced 
kidney stone formation rate while 
increasing the levels of citrate in urine, 
which was shown by comparing urine 
tests before and after the treatment. 

“We had an initial baseline 24-hour 
urine test on them; we do this when-
ever we are looking at kidney stone 
patents as a procedure,” Sur said. “We 
look at their 24-hour excretion of 
citrate and other natural substances 
that act against kidney stones.”

Patients with low levels of citrate 
are usually prescribed potassium 
citrate in order to increase those levels. 

 “In the experiment we actu-
ally compared lemonade to the ‘gold 
standard,’ a prescription medica-
tion called potassium citrate,” Sur 
said. “[Lemonade] is clearly effective 
because it profoundly increases citrate 
levels.”

Acid in citrus fruits 
dissolves the mineral
that causes kidney stones.

Two years after the annual Sun God Festival was first confined to RIMAC Field, this Friday’s event will remain central-ized — an arrangement that 
Associate Vice President of Concerts and 
Events Alex Bramwell said is an improve-
ment over the all-campus format.

Bramwell, the head Sun God planner, 
said the festival’s centralized structure allows 
for 12 hours of continuous programming. 

 “It gives us a lot of really creative oppor-
tunities, whereas in the past you had essen-
tially some random stuff going on in the 

daytime with no real central 
purpose to it,” he said. “Plus, 
it’s more safe. I would take 
the criticism of ‘caging’ Sun 
God to not have someone 
get hurt at a festival I was in 
charge of.”

According to former 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta, who ran on a 
platform promising to uncage Sun God, the 
endeavor proved unfeasible.

“We weren’t able to bring out [concert 
events] to Price Center, and that’s because 
there’d be too many people trying to look at 
the concert,” Gupta said. “And Price Center 
is just not a good location.”

Like last year, the festival — which fea-
tures headliners Drake, Michelle Branch, 
Relient K and Thrice —  will include the 
Dance and Midway Tents, a rock-climbing 

Finally, on Sun God Eve, the hype is history.

University officials decided on May 
5 to continue dual investigations into 
visual-arts associate professor Ricardo 
Dominguez. However, all details are 
being withheld from the public.

The first investigation will deter-
mine whether Dominguez’s March 4 
Virtual Sit-In violated computer-hack-
ing laws. It flooded the UC Office of 
the President’s website with messages 
such as “Transparency is not found at 
the UCOP.”

Dominguez called the sit-in an 
artistic act of protest.

“Art also brings [a] certain level of 
the unknown,” he said. “Protest is usu-
ally about the known.”

The second investigation cen-
ters on a cell-phone application 
Dominguez and visual-arts lecturer 
Brett Staulbaum designed to help ille-
gal immigrants find water while cross-
ing the U.S.-Mexico border. The uni-
versity donated $5,000 to the project 
in 2007. Now, administrators are con-
cerned with the legality of using tax-
payer dollars to aid illegal immigrants.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Audit 
& Management Advisory Services 
Stephanie Burke is leading the inves-
tigations. She will report findings to 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake, who will then 
determine whether subsequent action 
will be pursued.

Burke — along with Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management and Planning 
Gary Matthews; Investigations and 
External Audit Liaison Manager Robert 
Mannie; and UCSD spokeswomen 
Judy Piercey and Christine Clark — all 
declined to comment. Matthews said 
there is no definitive timeline for the 
investigation.

If the administrators conclude that 
Dominguez’s actions were illegal, he 
could be stripped of tenure. 

A UCSD press release on the 
investigation expressed that the uni-
versity does not take political posi-
tions on its researchers’ work.

Dominguez said he remains confi-
dent that the investigation will fail to 
yield any incriminating results.

“My sense is that the investigation 
will tell that the projects I’m being 
investigated for are the same projects 
that I have earned tenure for, and that 
my work is based on, and that my 
work will continue to be based on,” 
Dominguez said. “There will be no 
change either in my own work or in the 
standards of that work.”

wall, obstacle course and human foosball 
game, along with the standard row of ven-
dors.  Additionally, according to Bramwell, 
student-organization booths will have a stron-
ger presence on the field than they have in 
the past.

Festival coordinators eliminated last year’s 
“Loft on the Lawn” tent, as well as the noon-
time Price Center concerts leading up to the 
event. However, Gupta was able to schedule the 
Junkyard Derby on Friday this year by paying 
for it using council funds; in 2009, administra-
tors pressured the council to stage the derby the 
week after the festival.

Event co-coordinator Jeanette Ordonez 
said this year’s festivities are spaced through-
out the week — including a silent rave, a mini 
Sun God Carnival and an A.S.-sponsored 
water slide. In addition, student radio sta-
tion KSDT will hold indie music festival 
“Radiology” today at 6 p.m.; last year, it was 
known as “Shun God,” and was held on the 
same day as the main festival.

KSDT Manager Meredith Wong said the 
radio station could not hold the event on 
Friday because all Student Center space was 
already reserved by the administration, which 
she said would be detrimental to the turnout 
of the event.

“I think there are definitely differences 
on who will be coming,” Wong said. “On Sun 
God, it would be a bunch of students who 
were roaming around campus. On Thursday, 
I think it’s students who are housed in the 
Student Center, and people who just heard 
about it.”

She said she though the administration 
had pressured the station to hold the event on 
a different day because it wished to continue 
“caging” the festival.

“Some of [the administrators] were nice, but 
some of the admin. would try to pit us against 
A.S. students, telling us that we’re betraying 

them,” Wong said. “I think the admin. is really 
afraid of people’s safety on Sun God, and that’s 
why they’re restricting us. They want to be able 
to have police manage everything, and when 
everything is spread out, they have that fear.”

Director of University Centers Paul Terzino 
said the university tried to give more freedom 
to the student council this year.  

“We are reserving all of our facilities — 
that is, the Price Center and Student Center 
— holding that for A.S., so that they can have 
freedom in managing the day,” he said.

However, Bramwell said the council does 
not have any specific plans for the Student 
Center on the day of the festival.

“We never placed any holds — any reserva-
tions — with KSDT,” Bramwell said. “We had 
no reason to block them from doing their show 
on Friday.”

Marshall College senior Alice Nash said 
she preferred the atmosphere of the all-campus 
festival.

“I just liked how things were spread out 
over campus first year, but now things are just 
in RIMAC,” Nash said. “It’s kind of very cen-
tralized, and I like the all-inclusive thing.”

Both Bramwell and UCSD Police Chief 
Orville King refused to provide the cost of 
security or number of Staff Pro employees and 
police officers that will be patrolling the campus 
today and tomorrow. Bramwell said the cost of 
security on Friday would be roughly equal to 
past years, but that additional security would 
be required for the wristband line on Thursday. 
In 2007-08, the police bill was $15,000. That 
figure grew to $35,000 in 2008-09.

Students can pick up wristbands Thursday 
from noon to 6 p.m. and Friday starting at 9 
p.m. at a box office on Marshall Field.

2007
Three years back, the 
annual music festival 

was an all-campus
affair. It featured

student org booths on 
both Library Walk and 

Sun God Lawn, live 
bands in Price Center 
and a thinner security 
guard staff — along 

with an increase in 
injuries and arrests. 

2008
The ﬁrst Sun God Festival conﬁned to RIMAC Field is best remembered for a 
19-year-old Sean Kingston failing to make it through the end of his set. Other musical 
highlights included a high-energy show from rockers Coheed and Cambria and Matt 
Costa. The “no re-entry” policy was blamed for a higher occurance of binge drinking. 

2009
Last year’s Sun God Festival featured hip-hop group 

N.E.R.D., laid-back crooner Iron and Wine, and a  
brand-new Dance Tent for mashup guru Girl Talk and a 

slew of other deejays. Based on the resounding
success of a multiple-tent format, festival planners 

have decided to reinstate it this year.

When life gives you kidney stones, 
drink lemonade. 

That’s according to a UCSD study 
showing that lemonade can prevent 
the growth of kidney stones due to its 
high concentration of citrate, a natural 
inhibitor against stone formation. 

Kidney stones form when minerals 
become too concentrated in urine and 
crystallize in the kidneys. 

Roger Sur, director of UCSD’s 
Comprehensive Kidney Stone Center, 
conducted an experiment in which 
patients drank two liters of water — 
which had four ounces of lemon juice 
— twice daily for two months. 

“Lemonade’s been an anecdote for 
quite some time,” Sur said. “Our study 
specifically looked at how it can actu-
ally prevent stone formation.”

The study, conducted on par-
ticipants who had a history of kidney 
stones, confirmed that lemonade 
increases citrate levels in the urine. 
Since citrate prevents stone formation 
by raising the pH of urine and buffer-
ing it from becoming strongly acidic, 
the lemonade works to prevent the 
kidney stones. 

“The two big outcomes were that 
one, for people with low citrate levels, 
[lemonade] was a good method to 
increase those levels and, number two: 
decreased the amount of oxalate, and 
so, most importantly, the formation 
rate of kidney stones,” Sur said.

At the end of the study, X-ray 
imaging and citrate level tests demon-
strated that the lemonade had reduced 
kidney stone formation rate while 
increasing the levels of citrate in urine, 
which was shown by comparing urine 
tests before and after the treatment. 

“We had an initial baseline 24-hour 
urine test on them; we do this when-
ever we are looking at kidney stone 
patents as a procedure,” Sur said. “We 
look at their 24-hour excretion of 
citrate and other natural substances 
that act against kidney stones.”

Patients with low levels of citrate 
are usually prescribed potassium 
citrate in order to increase those levels. 

 “In the experiment we actu-
ally compared lemonade to the ‘gold 
standard,’ a prescription medica-
tion called potassium citrate,” Sur 
said. “[Lemonade] is clearly effective 
because it profoundly increases citrate 
levels.”

Acid in citrus fruits 
dissolves the mineral
that causes kidney stones.

Two years after the annual Sun God Festival was first confined to RIMAC Field, this Friday’s event will remain central-ized — an arrangement that 
Associate Vice President of Concerts and 
Events Alex Bramwell said is an improve-
ment over the all-campus format.

Bramwell, the head Sun God planner, 
said the festival’s centralized structure allows 
for 12 hours of continuous programming. 

 “It gives us a lot of really creative oppor-
tunities, whereas in the past you had essen-
tially some random stuff going on in the 

daytime with no real central 
purpose to it,” he said. “Plus, 
it’s more safe. I would take 
the criticism of ‘caging’ Sun 
God to not have someone 
get hurt at a festival I was in 
charge of.”

According to former 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta, who ran on a 
platform promising to uncage Sun God, the 
endeavor proved unfeasible.

“We weren’t able to bring out [concert 
events] to Price Center, and that’s because 
there’d be too many people trying to look at 
the concert,” Gupta said. “And Price Center 
is just not a good location.”

Like last year, the festival — which fea-
tures headliners Drake, Michelle Branch, 
Relient K and Thrice —  will include the 
Dance and Midway Tents, a rock-climbing 

Finally, on Sun God Eve, the hype is history.

University officials decided on May 
5 to continue dual investigations into 
visual-arts associate professor Ricardo 
Dominguez. However, all details are 
being withheld from the public.

The first investigation will deter-
mine whether Dominguez’s March 4 
Virtual Sit-In violated computer-hack-
ing laws. It flooded the UC Office of 
the President’s website with messages 
such as “Transparency is not found at 
the UCOP.”

Dominguez called the sit-in an 
artistic act of protest.

“Art also brings [a] certain level of 
the unknown,” he said. “Protest is usu-
ally about the known.”

The second investigation cen-
ters on a cell-phone application 
Dominguez and visual-arts lecturer 
Brett Staulbaum designed to help ille-
gal immigrants find water while cross-
ing the U.S.-Mexico border. The uni-
versity donated $5,000 to the project 
in 2007. Now, administrators are con-
cerned with the legality of using tax-
payer dollars to aid illegal immigrants.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Audit 
& Management Advisory Services 
Stephanie Burke is leading the inves-
tigations. She will report findings to 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake, who will then 
determine whether subsequent action 
will be pursued.

Burke — along with Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management and Planning 
Gary Matthews; Investigations and 
External Audit Liaison Manager Robert 
Mannie; and UCSD spokeswomen 
Judy Piercey and Christine Clark — all 
declined to comment. Matthews said 
there is no definitive timeline for the 
investigation.

If the administrators conclude that 
Dominguez’s actions were illegal, he 
could be stripped of tenure. 

A UCSD press release on the 
investigation expressed that the uni-
versity does not take political posi-
tions on its researchers’ work.

Dominguez said he remains confi-
dent that the investigation will fail to 
yield any incriminating results.

“My sense is that the investigation 
will tell that the projects I’m being 
investigated for are the same projects 
that I have earned tenure for, and that 
my work is based on, and that my 
work will continue to be based on,” 
Dominguez said. “There will be no 
change either in my own work or in the 
standards of that work.”

STEFANY CHEN/GUARDIAN

Once upon a time, three years ago, there existed a Sun God Festival like no Sun God Festival to come.
One where you stepped outside your on-campus 

apartment and a crowd of half-naked students cov-
ered in water/paint ran by; where the Price Center 
Fountain doubled as a wading pool; one where — for 
a single gloriously excessive day — every student 
under the San Diego sun was united with the com-
mon goal of learning to prioritize academic success a 
budge below having fun. 

It was a unique freedom — one that, sadly, most 
current students have never experienced, thanks to 
administrative lockdown beginning in 2008. In fear 
of being responsible for student deaths after a par-
ticularly belligerent 2007 festival, higher-ups bullied 
event planners into chainlinking RIMAC field, elimi-
nating re-entry privileges, hiring gobs more security 
personnel and preventing student-sponsored activi-
ties from occurring around campus.

The next year, tumbleweeds blew in what were 
once legendary Sun God hotspots. The epic Junkyard 
Derby race at Peterson Hall was converted to an 
underattended Thursday powwow, student-org tables 
were relocated to the RIMAC Field sidelines and the 
Price Center Fountain stood empty and still. 

Within a year, UCSD’s most infamous holiday 
had become a tamed version of a high-school car-
nival — complete with face painting and bouncy 
houses.

Since then, it’s been typical of student politicians 
— especially 2009-10 A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
— to promise they will “uncage” Sun God. That is, 
until newbies who never experienced the old festival 
began to assume positions on the student council. 

Just this year, Gupta asked former Associate Vice 
President of Student Orgs Andrew Ang to reinstate 
student-org booths on Library Walk, but Ang said 
most orgs preferred to set-up on RIMAC Field — 
“where the festival was.”

KSDT Radio, UCSD’s “fiercely independent” 
student-run station, also moved its annual anti-Sun 
God event to Thursday this year, ensuring that no 
other part of campus could compete with the under-
whelming and fiercely corporate acts on RIMAC 
field.

Turns out AVP of Concerts and Events Alex 
Bramwell — the guy who plans Sun God — prefers 
his fun orderly as well. In an interview with the 
Guardian on Monday (in which he refused to share 
this year’s increased cost of security), he defended 
the festival’s fenced-in format and said he’d cage the 
Sun God Festival any day if it meant he was saving a 
student’s life.

We understand that Bramwell can’t help but capi-
talize on the opportunity to play god at his own mini 
Coachella, but let’s not forget that this isn’t his event, 
— nor the A.S. Council’s. It’s a festival for the stu-
dents, paid for with $550,000 of their fees. It’s a stu-
dent’s decision to binge himself into a stupor — and 

The crowd is a renegade whirl-pool. Arms, legs, hair and sweat fuse, blur, spin fero-
ciously and disappear into black. 
Half a second later the slippery mass 
is there again, reignited by a sudden 
explosion of blinding pink light. Thick 
plumes of gritty yellow smoke fill the 
air. Brilliant white fog pours from the 
stage. The music, stuck firmly in some 
infinite loop of cracked-out Motown 
samples and ass-shaking Top-40 fare, 
drives this bizarre scene — pushing 
the crowd from frenzied to psychotic, 
from humans to human-shaped bags 
of pulsating electric gel. 

This is the Festival. Bottles in hand, 
red cups in tow, lewd self-indulgence 
on the mind, we sweep through cam-
pus for a single day of relentless 21st-
century hedonism. Classes be damned, 
inhibitions be forgotten — we have 
more important things to worry about. 
The Festival, after all, is the crux of our 
collegiate social integration, a daylong 
test of everything we’ve learned up to 
this point: how to get down, how to 
stay low, how to fix a blown-out laptop 
speaker by striking it savagely with the 
palm of one’s hand. We’re training for 
life. We’re shooting for excellence.

And where better to do it than 
here, in this place, on this day. 
Erupting from the concrete confines of 
our peaceful academic landscape, the 
Festival is a strange blending of things 
familiar and unexpected. Campus 
shuttles become raucous mobile dance 
parties; public restrooms transform 
into aqua-tiled dens of illicit behavior; 
roads are recast as sluggish pedestrian 
highways, clogged deep with rubber-
legged revelers determined to traverse 
any distance with the greatest of style 
and swagger. 

It’s an isolated awakening, a 
vivid yet temporary rendering of the 
everything-be-damned excitement 
and pure, unbridled desire to live. 
It’s youth. The Festival sets us loose, 
shoots us up with adrenaline and 
shoves us squarely in the direction 
of triumphant exhilaration. It’s us at 
our best, without boundaries. It’s us 
as nature never quite intended: sav-
age, inspired, blind to authority and 
drunk with freedom. The only thing 
that matters is what we want to matter. 
Everything else can wait.

Of course, this spirit is fleeting. 
It burns out the moment we falter, 
the instant we break down and let 
the quietest inkling of fatigue creep 
slowly past our desire to keep going. 
To maintain this spirit would be a tre-
mendous physical achievement, but to 
recapture it would be unnatural — a 
fabrication. 

So, with a collective sigh, the 
Festival dies down. Gradually, we 
become ourselves again, our vision 
restored yet still gently obscured by a 
distinct haze that reminds us we’ve just 
experienced something quite out of 
the ordinary. For the next several days, 
we’ll stumble across subtle indications 
of what happened — discarded bottles, 
hasty graffiti, an overturned trashcan 
suggesting a brief rebellion against 
some perceived injustice. 

In another year, it’ll happen again. 
Until then, we sink willingly into the 
bounds of ordinary life, our eyes fixed 
forward, our minds freshly endowed 
with the memory of the Festival.

earned its best-day-of-the-year repu-
tation with a rare ability to unite 
bio-obsessed wallflowers and brawny 
Greek bros under a common goal of 
turning our institution of learning 
into one giant playground.

But it seems the administra-
tion — along with wet blankets 
like Bramwell — have successfully 
tamed that unique phenomenon into 
just another music festival. They’ve 

squashed the possibility of maintain-
ing the original Sun God spirit at an 
institutional level — a sobering fact 
for the small population of us who 
still remember what it was like, and 
what it could be with support in the 
right places. 

It will only get worse as time 
goes on, and the memory fades. 
In fact, according to Bramwell, the 
administration will continue to push 
harder and harder for the festival 
to take place on a Saturday — and 
lord knows it will only take are a few 
spineless councilmembers to let that 
happen.

Our only advice to you, the stu-
dent, is to adopt the role of campus-
wide party-planner on Friday. Every 
year — even before administrators 

put a damper on our favorite rager 
— it’s the grassroots efforts of a few 
pioneering drunks that make this 
all-campus dance party special. Get 
creative and impulsive: Cover your-
self in body paint, get see-through 
in the Price Center Fountain, start a 
spontaneous rave in your local din-
ing hall and ignore any and every 
authority figure who tries to stand in 
your way — but you might consider 
running if you see a security officer 
fast approaching with some cuffs.

We’re begging you to help make it 
happen: Prove we’re not the cold and 
introspective nerd herd our fellow 
UC campuses think we are. We’re 
willing to do our part, too. Just meet 
us at the fountain — and don’t forget 
your game face.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
On April 28, the A.S. Council 

began debating a motion to divest 
from companies that do business with 
Israel. The resolution was peppered 
with various accusations of recent 
Israeli abuse of Palestinians, specifi-
cally citing the fighting in Gaza last 
year and the area’s present blockade. 

The particular accusations, 
however, were window-dressing 
— excuses for the resolution. 
Resolutions nearly identical to these 
have been debated in various forums 
in Europe and North America since 
2006, long before the present block-
ade and the Hamas-Israel war in 
January 2009. 

Indeed, the resolution’s sponsors 
knew very well that, if passed, any 
such resolution would have no con-
crete effect. The chairmen of General 
Electric and United Technologies 
would lose no sleep over the resolu-
tion because the university no longer 
holds investments in either company. 
The point was solely symbolic: It is 
part of a larger attempt to delegiti-
mize the state of Israel. By passing 
such a resolution, especially in a 
campus not known for having strong 
views on the subject, its proponents 
hoped the larger effort to boycott 
Israel would gain more momentum, 
with similar resolutions attempted 
elsewhere. 

At a certain point, readers must 
ask themselves: Why does Israel alone 
face such resolutions? Perhaps Israel’s 
occupation of the West Bank and 
Golan Heights justifies the council’s 
attempt to delegitimize it.

Such claims are riddled with flaws. 
For instance, although generally 
ignored by the media, Israel is not the 
only country to occupy disputed ter-

ritory. Critics of Israel ignore Turkey’s 
occupation of Northern Cyprus since 
the 1970s (and its treatment of its 
Kurdish population), and were never 
heard arguing for sanctions against 
Syria during its 29-year occupation 
of Lebanon (or its assassinations of 
anti-Syrian politicians since its with-
drawal). Indonesia’s occupation of 
East Timor (1975-99, during which 
200,000 died) went almost unnoticed 
in the Western media.

Divestment critics might counter 
that it is Israel’s particular actions 
that demand action. Yet compared 
to other similar conflicts, the death 
tolls are paltry. Palestinians and 
Arabs decry Israeli “genocide” of 
Palestinians. Compare this to other 
conflicts: In the past five years, the 
Janjaweed, a violent militant group, 
has killed 400,000 black Muslims in 
Darfur. In Rwanda, 800,000 people 
(more than 10 percent of the total 
population) were butchered in three 
months in 1994. In three years, 
Serbians killed 200,000 Bosnian 
Muslims (10 percent of the total 
population). 

Realizing that the resolution failed 
to reflect reality, the A.S. Council 
moved to indefinitely table the mea-
sure last week. In doing so, the coun-
cil kept itself from becoming pawns 
of those seeking to delegitimize the 
state of Israel at any opportunity.

t wouldn’t be entirely out 
of character for Drake to 
show up to Sun God in a 
wheelchair; after all, the 
world was first introduced 

to Aubrey Drake Graham as the 
paralyzed ex-b-baller Jimmy on 
“Degrassi: The Next Genera-
tion.” Since then, the Canadian 
has graduated the teen-soap gig 
for songwriting sessions with 
Lil Wayne, rumored romantic 
exploits with Rihanna and a 
Grammy nomination — not a 
bad upgrade. 

You might think the kid is 
hip-hop royalty already, but 
he hasn’t actually released a 
proper album: Major-label debut 
Thank Me Later doesn’t drop 
until June 15. All Drake has to 
prove that he’s worthy of Jay-Z 
and Eminem’s love is hit single 
“Best I Ever Had,” his spot on 
“Forever” and a few forgettable 
(if promising) mixtapes. 

Last year’s So Far Gone is one 
such promise: Though Drake’s 
lyrics are often ridiculous —“I 
really can’t complain, every-
thing’s kosher/ Two thumbs up, 
Ebert and Roeper” — they’re 
never boring, and his beats are 
always made by the best. 

Drake has quickly become 
the model for a new school of 
popular hip-hop — championed 
by the melodramatic Kanye West, 
who has chosen Drake as one of 

his prodigies — in which dance-
able pacing is chucked for sincer-
ity, synths are the new samples 
and hooks take precedence over 
rhymes. Let’s call it post-rap. 

Tracks leaked from his new 
album only amp the promise. 
Single “Over” — an unabashed 
throwdown consumed by string 
and horn arrangements — is 
utterly triumphant, while the 
Kanye-produced “Find Your 
Love” sounds a lot like, well, 
Kanye. 

In the vein of “Degrassi,” 
Drake takes more from sweet 
indie-rock than R&B when it 
comes to singing and sampling. 
Mixtape highlights “Let’s Call It 
Off” and “Little Bit” feature Peter 
Bjorn and John and Lykke Li, 
respectively. (And with Lil Wayne 
on his side, Drake can pretty 
much do whatever he wants.)

Unfortunately, all that pret-
tiness probably won’t shine 
through his bumbling live show. 
Drake is a studio technician, not 
a performer, and his reliance on 
more successful artists won’t get 
him anywhere, seeing as Weezy 
can’t exactly fly the coop for a 
night of science-nerd debauch-
ery. Plus, it’s hard to take Drake’s 
swag seriously when all we’re 
asking ourselves is, “Since when 
was Jimmy cool?”

mid the brash 
hip-hop artists and 
mashup deejays set 
to storm RIMAC 
Field tomorrow 

will be a familiar female voice 
taking you back to a bygone era. 
No matter how dramatically 
your taste in music has evolved 
since singer-songwriter Michelle 
Branch clogged radio waves half 
a lifetime ago, she’s the irrefut-
able soundtrack to your middle-
school memories. Try as you 
may, you can’t not sing along.

Of course, her modern-day 
irrelevance has raised specula-
tion as to why an artist best 
known for a single released 10 
years ago is headlining the big-
gest event of the 
year. Turns out, 
she’s still 
touring, 
and 

— after a seven-year hiatus due 
mostly to pregnancy — released 
new album Everything Comes 
and Goes. It’s her third solo 
effort, her second attempt at 
exploring the country genre and 
a tragically far cry from our nos-
talgic kick.

Branch first rode into the 
spotlight on a wave of alt-rock 
females that shunned the party-
pop image forged by Britney 
and Christina in favor of sen-
sitive guitars and diary-style 
songwriting.

Still, breakout single 
“Everywhere” put Branch on top 
of the charts with the blondes, 
riding a simple power-pop riff 
and relatedly ambiguous lyrics 
(people frequently asked her if 
the song was about god). Three 
years later, she released Hotel 
Paper, a low-key sophomore 
effort that garnered moder-
ate success with “Since U Been 
Gone” foreshadower “Are You 
Happy Now.”

From there, the trail grows 
cold. Following Paper, Branch 

he godfather of the 
mashup might just be 
old enough — after 42 
years and half a lifetime 
behind the tables — for 

Sun God-goers to write him off as 
stale sliced bread from yesterday’s 
toaster. Especially when compared 
to last year’s Dance Tent headliner: 
electro-age people’s hero Girl Talk.

As Zach Sciacca — better known 
as DJ Z-Trip — put it, “I might be 
on ‘mix’ on the blender, and he’s on 
‘chop.’” Girl Talk morphs Top-40 hits 
into space-age eight-legged beasts, 
stimulating enough to placate the 
new generation of digital multitask-
ers. (After all, if you can’t have us 
dancing within five seconds, we’ll 
move on to the next guy.)

So Girl Talk took Z-Trip’s con-
cept and ran with it — an admirable 
evolution. But there’s something to 
be said for the more careful weave 
of the veteran, who usually sticks 
to two tracks at a time and delivers 
vocal and melody lines uninjured 
(but for some expert flourishes). 
His respect for the originals usually 
trumps any itch in his quick fingers.

“[Girl Talk says] ‘Yeah, I’m not a 
deejay.’ Well, kind of you are, man,” 
Sciacca said. “Anyone who plays 
other people’s music, to a degree, is 
a deejay. … That’s where my whole 
culture’s from. What am I, going 
to shit on everyone before me? Be 
like, ‘I’m not one of them.’ You’re an 
extension of that. Accept it.”

Z-Trip is a natural crate digger, 
making for a repertoire that requires 
heavy listening — best enjoyed on 
a subtle high and a pair of good 

headphones. And this element of 
the unfamiliar (laced into the old 
favorite, of course; no one can resist 
the Beatles) is what keeps him com-
petitive among “NOW!” samplers 
like Girl Talk — 
especially since 
his Motown and 
B-boy gems are 
always ones we 
wish we’d found ourselves.

Live, though, Z-Trip’s obscure 
samples and awkward pacing 
can form a thick smoothie for a 
pleasure-seeking mob to swallow. 
For this reason, Sciacca said his best 
crowds come with an open mind. 

“It’s up and down,” he said. “Ebb 
and flow, like a sin wave. There’s 
moments where people are crazy. 
There’s moments where it’s more 
cerebral. There’s moments to focus 
on a technical thing — me scratch-
ing — or on a political statement … 
versus, OK, now we’re just going to 
smash our heads against the wall: 
Here’s some Metallica.”

That’s not to say Z-Trip can’t 
make you dance.

“I do think that’s one good thing 
Girl Talk does: totally incorporate 
the crowd,” he said. “There’s other 
things I don’t necessarily care for, 
but he can get people up there and 
dancing, and that’s the whole fuck-
ing point of it anyway. … It’s about 
coming out and shaking your ass 
and getting down. That’s a huge 
part of why the fuck I do this.”

Over a decade after Uneasy 
Listening, his debut with DJ P, blew 
him (independently) global, the 
album remains an opus in the histo-
ry of the mashup, a groundbreaking

8�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2010� SUN GOD

Relient K
atering to the traditional rock-band backstory, Relient 
K was founded by a pack of 15-year-olds screwing 
around in their mother’s garage. Though they began as 

a niche Christian-rock band, the group eventually broke into the 
mainstream, soon peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Top 200. The 
Guardian spoke with lead singer Matt Thiessen about bad breakups, 
playing Warped Tour and hitting the beach before Sun God.

G: Why a Christian rock band? 
Matt Thiessen: When we were 15 to 16 years old, Matt Hoop — 
the other guitar player — and I grew up in the church, and we 
went to youth group. There’s a bunch of punk-rock groups in the 
smaller scene in that youth-group culture that we really admire. 
We wanted to start opening for them, and the songs were about 
positive things — and that was really appealing to us as well. And 
we knew that we weren’t going to bum out our parents by having 
lyrics they didn’t approve of. Matt’s mom wouldn’t have let him in 
the band otherwise. 
G: Was it difficult to break into the mainstream music industry? 
MT: When you start out as a Christian band and other people 
don’t share your beliefs, you can kind of get stuck being perceived 
as that. Fortunately, we’ve been able to talk about things in a way 
that’s not preachy. We’ve never been in people’s faces about things. 
If you don’t share our beliefs, just listen to our songs and take what 
you want from them. And that’s kind of the beauty of music. We 
decided that we really wanted to start to try opening for bands 
that weren’t only associated with Christian music, and that led 

Crash Kings
ike a sandwich without bread, Crash Kings is a rock band 
without guitars. A sharper, heavier version of the Fray 
with a beefed-up bass section and some weird contrap-
tion called a clavinet, the band generates enough noise for 
us to forget the key ingredient is nowhere to be heard. 

While the clavi-what plus toe-tapping keyboard make up 
their trademark sound, it’s Tony Beliveau’s well-trained pipes 
that steal the show, channeling hits like “Mountain Man” with an 
assertive, folksy swag reminiscent of Cage the Elephant’s “Ain’t 
No Rest for the Wicked.” 

Granted, only the most musically attuned (and sober) of Sun 
God’s masses will appreciate the band’s avant-garde rejection of 
rock ‘n’ roll’s bottlenecked centerpiece. The rest will slur their way 
through the Kings’ crystal-clear lyrics while waiting for the heavy-
weights to take the stage, wondering why the guitar is missing two 
strings. 

—Imran Manji 
Staff Writer

Thrice
or all those hardcore alt-rock heads out there 
(including Associate Vice President of Concerts 
and Events Alex Bramwell, the festival’s coor-
dinator), Thrice’s performance at Sun God will 
be the beacon of a long day filled with hip-hop, 

girl-pop and under-the-radar indie acts. But there’s cause 
for skepticism when it comes the head-banging potential 
of the festival’s only big-name rock performance: Though 
their latest LP has all the angst of Thrice past, it’s missing 
the catchy, subversive optimism that made cuts like “Stare 
at the Sun” so appealing. 

With lyrics like “Darkness brings terrible things/ The 
sun is gone,” new single “All the World Is Mad” is a case 
for outlawing overdramatic emo-rock in the 21st century 
— or at least at Sun God.

As far as Thrice’s live performance goes, what you 
see is what you get. There aren’t a whole lot of theatrics 
involved, but — thankfully — there’s also not a huge 
disconnect between the band’s work in the recording 
studio and what they do onstage. And in the end, every 
feel-good, carefree day of festivities has room for an 
angry mosh-pit sesh to force our hair down.

It’s not saying much, but at least Thrice will provide a 
punky contrast to Michelle Branch’s newfound country 
influence and Relient K’s more happy-go-lucky Christian 
rock. The rest of us can hide out in the dance tent.

f T.I. actually wants to assume the “swagger of a 
college kid,” he should take a tip or two from new 
labelmate Bobby Ray Simmons — aka B.o.B., 
latest and greatest in the 21st-century parade of 
cute skater boys in purple hoodies, rapping about 

Legos instead of bullet holes and puppy love instead of 
banging the bartender.

His dexterous ability to flit between pop-rock, 
R&B and hip-hop — along with the classical smarts to 
attract the finest collaborators from each — sets him 
apart from the rest of the Kanyes- and Pharrells-in-
training. Plus, he may have recruited the golden-voiced 
Bruno Mars to do the swoony hook on current single 
“Beautiful Girls,” but B.o.B. can actually hit a few notes 
himself — as on “Lovelier Than You” and late-2008 
single “I’ll Be in the Sky.” (Which is more than can be 
said of a certain headliner. Starts with a “D” and ends 
with a “rake.”)

In fact, if this were Sun God 2012, B.o.B. would prob-
ably be billed at the top of the lineup in place of the afore-
mentioned one-trick pony. He’s got a bounce in his step, a 
voice big enough to fill the San Diego sky and a full band 
to put the funk into the finale fireworks. The only thing 
currently holding the boom-bappin’ youngster back from 
the bigtime, aside from his new-kid nametag, is his strug-
gle to choose one persona and stick with it. One moment 
he’s a puddle of lovestruck putty; the next, he’s trying to 
lean as hard as his ATL street idols.

But with hooks for days and a goofball versatility 
that gives Andre 3000 a run for his money, every one 
of B.o.B’s faces is impossible not to love. Take a break 
from the afternoon tequila binge to catch him while 
he’s hot.

The Parson 
Red Heads

he Parson Red Heads are clean, formulaic, 
tightly packaged and ridiculously content with 
their own brand of chill.

That’s not to say that this troupe of steel-
stringed, indie-bearded Oregonians make for 

a bad listen. In fact, they’re likely to throw down the 
most overtly pleasant set of the day — one that radiates 
happy times and the kind of hip nostalgia you’d find in a 
discarded Polaroid. You’ll approach the stage asking who 
the hell these guys are, and leave feeling like you just 
swallowed a rainbow.

At times, the Red Heads revel a little too long in 
faded choral arrangements, sparsely placed slide guitar 
and airy vocal harmonies that channel the peace-and-
love communion of a Vietnam-era folk-rock supergroup 
— resulting in something like a Disney version of Fleet 
Foxes. Then, with little notice, they switch gears from 
vintage hippie rock to upbeat summertime alt-pop, 
leaving behind harmony in favor of shrill synthesizers 
and a rapid, clean down stroke. Frequent breakdowns 
complete this perfect picture, while the band claps in 
unison for the sheer joy of being alive. 

Their music might fade unnoticed into the wasted 
Sun God soundscape, but think twice before passing 
the Red Heads by. They’ll be waiting with open arms, 
positive thoughts and at least 30 minutes of instant (if 
forgettable, like the rest of the day) gratification.

Shark 
Attack

e prepared for an oscillating wave of 
build-ups, breakdowns and midday sway 
in the Dance Tent on Friday, courtesy of 
local deejay duo Shark Attack. Coronado 
duo Patrick Heaney and Mike Delgado got 

their start with residency at the Beauty Bar in San Diego, 
every time Shark Attack Tuesday cam around. (The 
name stuck.)

Working their way up the club ladder, the pair soon 
began to spin alongside giants like Steve Aoki, LA Riots 
and the Bloody Beetroots — in addition to driving 
massive, sweaty crowds into hysteria all on their own at 
venues like Voyeur and our very own Loft. 

Heaney and Delgado will likely be performing stuff 
from 2009 EP “Shooting Judas,” a lightning set packed 
with diverse beats that mimic ambulance sirens and car 
alarms. Most tracks are fast and danceable, but beware 
of buzz-killing slow moments: They will either come as 
welcome breathers or simply piss you off.

Shark Attack is a heavy and throbbing pick for a 
sunlit 2 p.m. canopy slot, but your Cap Mo-spiked brain 
cells probably won’t know the difference anyway.

Robbed By 
Robots

ising out of the Long Beach electronic scene, Robbed By 
Robots is a nu-disco deejay who spins house and radio 
pop into a cotton-candy lather. Most importantly: It’s 
danceable enough to get us moving, even before the 

ecstasy kicks in.
This club guru will keep the crowd hopping with hands in the 

air, throwing down a hyperactive setlist of original production and 
upbeat remixes of ’90s pop favorites. For those of us who see Sun 
God as another excuse to break out the outrageous rave attire and 
bathe ourselves in lasers, Robbed By Robots is the perfect Dance 
Tent escape from the weak beats of this year’s mainstream pop-rock 
and hip-hop.

Diversion
Sound

he Tuesday before Diversion Sound won the April 3 Battle 
of the Bands at the Loft — earning a slot on the Sun God 
Festival’s Main Stage — the trio did something they’d 
never done before: They played their first show together.

Well, sort of. To be fair, it wasn’t the first time non-
student Andrew Charlton and Marshall College seniors Derek Lau 
and Kellen Steffen had jammed together. Hailing from Silicon Valley 
myself, I’ve known all three band members since middle school, 
and have witnessed many a Diversion Sound performance — minus 
Steffen, plus a bunch of other kids — in Charlton’s garage.

Back then, drummer Lau and bassist-turned-singer Charlton 
were two Incubus fanboys who loved epic instrumental interludes 
and were admittedly clueless as to how to mesh meaningful vocals 
with their desire to wig out. 

“I wouldn’t sing,” Charlton said. “I’d just turn up the music.”
Since then, the group has undergone a few changes, both in 

sound and membership. They ran through a couple of fringe gui-
tarist and lead singers and tried their hand at local venues — then 
broke up when it came time for Lau to leave for college.

After Charlton — who had battled addictions with drugs and 
alcohol throughout high school — was released from rehab, he 
decided to move down to San Diego for a DS reunion. That’s when 
he and Lau asked their friend Steffen to fill the role of bassist.

Designer
Drugs

ichael Vincent Patrick, one half of 
electronic duo Designer Drugs, spends 
a lot of time flying coast to coast. After 
performing in San Diego last Thurs-

day, Patrick flew home to New York prior to his slated 
appearance at Sun God. Back on his native coast, Patrick 
spoke with the Guardian about the future of DD, his 
friendship with bandmate Theodore Paul Nelson and his 
thoughts on West Coast living.

The Guardian: Do you like the West Coast?
Patrick: Yeah.
G: Have you had In-N-Out yet?
MP: [Laughs] I have, yeah. I’m not a huge fan. Though it 
is pretty good — the first time I had it I loved it. 
G: When did you start making music?
MP: When I was like 13 years old, I started toying 
around. I wanted to be in a punk-rock band. 
G: What made you decide to move away from that genre 
of music?
MP: I started getting into the stuff that was coming 
out at the time — a lot of new electronic music that 
was surfacing, like stuff that was getting mainstream. 
That’s how I got exposed to it, once stuff started getting 
popular on TV.
G: When did you and Theodore meet?  
MP: When we were like 15 or 16. We both had [an] 
interest in similar music, so we both sort of messed 
around, trying to make music. But between then and 
now, we’ve done a lot of stuff. We’ve gone our separate 
ways several times. But we’ve always stayed in touch. 
Once we decided to do the Designer Drugs project, we 
were both stoked on it, and both put forth the effort.
G: Is he still in medical school right now?
MP: He has to take some big exams this summer, and I 
think he’s studying for … uh … some big test or some-
thing. I don’t know. I kind of don’t pay attention. So I 
don’t know how much touring he’s going to d,o or how 
much studio work he’s going to do. 

Skeet Skeet
e may have a flash-in-the-pan stage name 
and a style he brushes off as “electro indie 
party shit,” but killer deejay Skeet Skeet 
keeps the drunks swaying and the trippers 
tripping to a timeless groove.

His mixes are delicate little webs spun from a gener-
ous sampling of songs — from Nirvana, Queen, Jay-Z, 
Whitney Houston — and treated with dirty beats and 
out-of-nowhere manipulations. The dance-pop chorus 
of Katy Perry’s “Hot ‘N’ Cold” evolves into a psychedelic 
trip-hop experience before melding into a Janet Jackson 
track. Hell, he even makes Ke$ha’s “Tik Tok” listenable.

His samples mix, mash and collide, but they never 
lose their bounce or sense of humor — mostly because 
Skeet himself radiates likeability, winning over his audi-
ence just as effortlessly as the artists he samples. 

Though Skeet is one of the lesser-known names on 
the bill, he’s sure to rack up some reccommendations 
from those of us coherent enough to make our way to 
Rimac Field before the sun sets.

10�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2010� HIATUS

G: Would you like to collaborate with 
other artists in the future?
MP: I think what I would really like 
to do is write music — you know, 
pop songs for like, Britney Spears — 
just because it seems like it would 
be really fun to do. We just don’t 
have the time right now; but that 
would be cool. But right now, I’m 
not too interested in collaborating 
— I’d like to just work on our own 
originals. We just wrote an album; 
it’s going to come out in September. 
The first one was such a learning 
experience that I’m even more ex-
cited to do the second one, because 
I think we have a better idea of what 
we need to do.
G: Is the new album you’re coming 
out with mostly original tracks or 
remixes?
MP:  It’s going to be all original songs 
— like 12 songs, 13 songs. Maybe a 
few remixes for our fans.
G: Do you enjoy making remixes 
more, or original tracks?
MP: I think originals, yeah. You 
have more of a blank canvas with 
originals. 
G: What’s your favorite Designer 
Drugs song?
MP: That’s a tough one. ‘Drop Down’ 
is probably my favorite original.  
G: Any pre-show rituals?
MP: Not really. I just normally do 
shots, and that’s about it. Sometimes 
I’ll take a nap or watch “Full Metal 
Jacket” or something — get pumped 
up. 
G: What’s your alcohol of choice?
MP: We used to drink Jameson. 
Now we drink Patron or some 
sort of tequila before the show. I 
switched just recently from whiskey 
to tequila, just to stay out of trouble. 
[Laughs.]
G: Pretty fitting for where we are.
MP: Yeah, definitely. It’ll be good 
after my San Diego tacos.

Associate Focus Editor

to another thing and another thing, 
and eventually we’re on Warped 
Tour, touring with bands like Good 
Charlotte.
G: How have your fans reacted to your 
new album?
MT: You know, it’s been really great, 
because if we put out an album that 
people expected, I definitely don’t 
think we’d be on tour with Paramore 
right now; I don’t think that Jive 
would have picked up the record. 
Changing our sound and making a 
record we’re proud of was a big part 
of keeping this band around, and I’m 
really glad that we did it. I feel like 
our fans are really growing with us, 
and do really like the new record. 
We’ve been playing mostly new stuff 
live, and the reaction’s been great. 
G: How do you feel about your new 
album being marketed as a breakup 
album? 
MT: There are songs from our earlier 
record that were really brutally hon-
est ... but [our fans] just don’t know. 
But this time around, it’s on the 
Internet: Matt broke up with his girl. 
Everyone kinda knows that that’s 
what this record is about. It’s a little 
bit embarrassing being so honest and 
forthcoming with your feelings ... but 
I think if I can go through something 
and put into songs how I deal with 
it ... maybe some people can learn to 
get over things and learn from what 
I’ve gone through. 
G: How excited are you for Sun God? 
MT: We’re really excited for Thrice. 
We just played with Drake at Bam-
boozle. I’m supposed to write songs 
with [Michelle Branch], and I look 
forward to hanging out with her. 
G: Can we expect to see you guys at 
the beach this weekend? 
MT: Surfing is on my short list of 
things to do; I don’t know if I’ll get 
out there the day of the show, but I’ll 
definitely try sometime that weekend.

calm still earning its keep among flashy 
updates to the sound.

Z-Trip spent the next half-decade 
evading copyright law, honing his live 
show and posting all his work online 
for free, years before the Radiohead 
publicity stunt (www.djztrip.com/down-
loads. html). Even the self-built beats 
on 2005’s Shifting Gears are tailored 
mostly to the zippy indie raps on top.

Indeed, after 20 years on the scene, 
Z-Trip remains the most trustworthy 
of matchmakers, whether finding a 
bed of bass for Barry Manilow or the 
right groove for whoever is staring up 
at him. He may not bring Girl Talk’s 
balloons and toilet paper, but Z-Trip’s 
half-improv live mix proves that noth-
ing can make our chests swell like a 
long-forgotten hook from left field. 
At Coachella, he overlaid a rollicking 
dubstep with John Lennon’s “Taxman” 
vocals, sending the crowd into a hissy 
fit of low-end nostalgia. (“I got raped 
on my taxes this year,” he said. “So I 
was like ‘Fuck it, I’m pissed.’”)

The exploding dubstep movement 
— particularly in LA, where he lives — 
exemplifies the tsunami of bedroom 
deejays Z-Trip is up against.

“It’s just the quantity — the sheer 
amount — is building, and I’m notic-
ing that the really good stuff is getting 
harder to find within all of it,” he 
said. “You have a lot kids who are just 
jumping on the bandwagon, which 
slows things down a little bit.”

As for this Friday, Z-Trip said his 
setlist will have everything to do with 
the vibe he gets from the crowd.

“At this point, I don’t really have 
anything really planned, but that could 
change,” he said. “I’m a big fan of the 
impromptu. If there’s somebody there 
at the festival I haven’t seen in a while, 
I don’t know, maybe we could collabo-
rate on some shit. … There’s always 
that wild card that I’d like to keep open. 
I can jam with anybody. I love that.”

—Simone Wilson
Editor in Chief

DS kept their ambitions modest at 
first, performing at churches and boba 
shops, always with eager tagalongs 
on other instruments. Soon enough, 
though, they recognized a need to 
make their four-minute riffs more 
audience-friendly — and, after some 
coaxing from Lau, Charlton signed up 
for singing lessons.

Just in time for their university’s 
biggest gig, DS finished recording their 
first EP and whittled down their mem-
bership to the core three. Charlton 
shaped his voice into a Creed-esque 
blanket that flows over the grand 
drum/bass marathon of Steffen and 
Lau — caught in a perpetual near-tears 
serenade about how life is bad but 
always gets better.

“If I Don’t Mind,” a meditative 
piece sprinkled with handclaps and 
driven by a catchy chorus, is the 
groove to listen for come Sun God. 
Their other tracks stray into long 
clouds of atmospheric jam, topped 
with vocal cheese courtesy of Charlton 
(he’s also the author of a Christian 
children’s book). Still, even the most 
jaded literature major will find it 
refreshing to hear Charlton belt, “If 
you believe in what you’re doing/ It 
shouldn’t matter what they say” — 
and know he actually lives by it. 

Though the band is “nervous as 
hell” for this Friday, Lau said they’re 
not expecting much of a turnout.

“I honestly don’t think there’s 
going to be that many people there,” 
Lau said. “Maybe 150.”

“Including workers,” Charlton said. 
“And Michelle Branch and 

Drake,” Steffen added.
Whatever the size of the audi-

ence, the trio plans to throw it down.
“We have this motto, right?” 

Charlton said. “It’s like: ‘Play every 
show like it’s the most important 
show’ — because most of the time it 
is the most important show.”

—Alyssa Bereznak
Managing Editor

dropped into relative obscurity, 
marrying her bass player and giving 
birth to a baby girl in 2006. 

Now, on Everything, Branch 
seems determined to prove that her 
career still has legs.  

The new stuff is not entirely ter-
rible, in Country Music Television 
context — it’s just not what we want. 
Though Branch retains the same 
straightforward honesty, guitar-
driven melodies and lovelorn lyrics 
from previous albums on lead single 
“Sooner Or Later,” it’s too plucky and 
twangy to picture it blasting from 
Mom’s 4-Runner, like in the good 
old days.

Still, “This Way” finds Branch 
channeling the Delta Spirit with 
throaty vocals that slide up and down 
a sparse steel. The whimsical number 
features a hypnotic chorus on which 
Branch does what she does best, alter-
nating emphasis on every other word 
and hanging on the line “Too many 
times I have told you.” Like all her 
hits, it reverberates in our minds long 
after the last string has ceased to echo. 

Now that the pop charts have 
wisened to artier spectacles like Lady 
Gaga, Branch’s strategic move away 
from the desolate girl-rock trend and 
toward the more specialized niche of 
popular country (with an easier-to-
please fan base) is a smart commercial 
move. But here’s to hoping that, come 
tomorrow, she won’t spend her whole 
set vetting her new album and swag 
— instead rocking the ripped jeans to 
revisit some old favorites. To us, her 
appeal isn’t necessarily as a composer, 
or even a singer. Branch’s true value 
lies in the memory of what we were 
doing when we first heard her, in an 
age when every MySpace Top-Eight 
demote was worthy of a good, hard 
cry, and a smile from that blond boy 
in third period was enough to make 
any day our birthday.

HPV vaccine?

Think Again

If you didn’t get the Gardasil vaccine as part 
of your childhood immunizations, it’s not too 
late. Planned Parenthood now offers free or 

low-cost Gardasil for women who want to 
significantly reduce their risk of getting 

HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer.

for a double on a hit to center field, 
putting two men on base with no 
outs for the Tritons. After junior 
outfielder Aaron Bauman grounded 
out, the Toros intentionally walked 
Gregorich to load the bases for 
junior third baseman Evan Kehoe. 
Kehoe then dropped a bunt that 
advanced the runners and scored 
Albitz for a 5-4 lead, with all run-
ners safe on the play. Susdorf then 
blasted a base-clearing, 
three-run double, giving 
UCSD the 8-4 win. 

With two games 
remaining in the series, 
all Triton hope for a con-
ference title and regional 
playoff berth hinged on 
Saturday’s high-pressure, 
double-elimination dou-
bleheader. 

In Game One, the 
UCSD offense had no 
answer to a Toro four-
run fourth inning. 
Scoring just one run in 
both the fifth and sixth 
innings wasn’t enough to 
even the score, and two 
more late-game Toro runs negated 
a Triton run in the seventh, seal-
ing a 6-3 Toro victory. The loss left 
the Tritons in a high-stakes, one-
game championship playoff with 
the Toros — with the conference 
tournament title and a birth in the 
NCAA Western Regionals at stake.

As the team’s national champi-
onship ambitions hung in the bal-
ance, O’Brien entrusted senior start-
ing right-hander Kirby St. John to 
start the championship game on the 
mound.

However, St. John said the pres-
sure had little effect on his mental 
preparation and execution.

“I just felt really relaxed and 
confident as I was warming up,” St. 
John said. “I did my best to maintain 
those feelings throughout the game.”

He did not disappoint. Through 
nine innings, St. John held the Toros 
to just three earned runs on seven 
hits. He said his solid performance 
could be attributed to the run sup-
port provided by the Triton offense.

“The team did a great job of 
piling on runs and playing good 
defense,” St. John said. “[It] helped 
me focus on just minimizing any 
threats they posed.”

The Triton hitters responded to 
the Game One loss by 
combining for 12 hits, 
eight runs, seven RBIs and 
two home runs in Game 
Two. Saul had three hits 
and three runs, Bauman 
finished three-for-five 
with two RBIs — includ-
ing his eighth home run 
of the year. In addition 
Gregorich had four hits, 
including a pair of dou-
bles, and Kehoe went two-
for-four with three RBIs 
and his eighth home run. 
With the 8-3 win, UCSD 
claimed its third CCAA 
Tournament champion-
ship in school history. 

“Our pitchers did a great job 
holding the other team’s offenses 
in check while our position play-
ers did a great job putting runs up 
on the scoreboard,” senior catcher 
Kellen Lee said. “Kirby St. John — 
one of our senior leaders — threw a 
great game on Saturday in the final 
game. From the moment he took the 
mound, everyone knew that he was 
bringing his ‘A’ game. That was a 
big-time performance in a big-time 
game.”

The Sunday following their vic-
tory in Stockton, the UCSD base-
ball team was officially named 
the NCAA West Regional’s No. 1 
seed. The four-team NCAA West 
Regional, set to take place at the 
Major League Baseball Urban Youth 
Academy in Compton, Calif., from 

May 13 to May 16, will cast the 
Tritons into a first-round region-
al matchup against fourth-seed 
Hawaii Pacific — the Pacific West 
Conference champions.

Susdorf said the Tritons won’t be 
changing their practice routine even 
though they have no prior experi-
ence playing against their upcoming 
opposition from Hawaii.

“I’m sure the way we will prepare 
for Hawaii Pacific is just by prac-
ticing how we normally practice,” 
Susdorf said. “I mean, it’s been suc-
cessful, so why change it up?”

St. John said the team’s prepara-
tion will depend on what they learn 
about Hawaii Pacific in the days 
leading up to the May 13 game.

“This week, with the short turn-
around between CCAA and region-
als, we are focusing on re-energizing 
ourselves and having a few really 
solid, detail-oriented practices,” St. 
John said. “We haven’t found out 
much about Hawaii Pacific yet, but 
I’m sure we will be hearing more in 
the next couple of days.”

The game’s first pitch will 
be thrown Thursday at 2 p.m. 
in Compton, Calif. Cal State 
Dominguez Hills faces No. 3-seeded 
Chico State in the second game of 
the double-elimination tournament.
The winner of the NCAA West 
Regional will advance to Cary, N. 
Car., to participate in the eight-team 
NCAA National Finals.

“We need to play our game the 
way we know how, and the result 
will take care of itself,” Lee said. 
“Throughout the entire season, we 
have realized that our biggest oppo-
nent is ourself, and that when we 
are not successful, it is due to beat-
ing ourselves. We just need to stay 
relaxed and composed on offense, 
defense and the mound — because 
that’s when we are at our best.”

LINGO LEXICON HOTCORNER
Ball boy: bawl boi, n. —
A person, male or female, tasked 
with retrieving balls from the 
court that have gone out of play.

The former assistant strength and conditioning coach 
at Marquette University was recently hired as the new 
director of athletic performance at UCSD. Thomas joins 
the athletic staff after three years with the Golden Eagles.

RUDY THOMAS | ATHLETICS DEPT.

T he UCSD baseball team’s season has been noth-ing short of magical. It bagged the California Collegiate Athletic Association regular-season title, took home the conference tournament crown, cur-rently owns the No. 1 national ranking in Division-
II and earned several individual honors.

After they won CCAA Tournament on May 8 — securing 
their second consecutive championship — the No. 1 Tritons 
proved they are nowhere near finished raking in the accolades. 

“The CCAA tournament was really exciting, and it was a 
great way to start off our playoff run,” senior pitcher Kirby St. 
John said. “The atmosphere and competition was what we’ve 
come to expect from playoffs.”

UCSD traveled to Stockton, Calif., on Thursday, and beat 
No. 29 Chico State 8-5 in its first game of the tournament. 
The Tritons cruised to victory as junior starter Tim Shibuya 
pitched seven innings of two-run ball, earning him his school-
record-tying eleventh win of the year.

The Triton offense jumped on Chico early with a five-run 
first inning. Freshman designated hitter Danny Susdorf led 
the team, going three-for-five with two runs scored, two runs 
batted in and a home run. Senior closer Daniel Simmons fin-
ished off the Wildcats, sending off the four hitters he faced in 
order, striking out two of them and booking UCSD’s spot in 
the semifinals.

Susdorf, who has had a breakout freshman year, said his 
late-season success at the plate is thanks to improvements in 
his mental maturation and self confidence.

“My approach lately is just to be as relaxed as possible at 
the plate,” Susdorf said. “At the beginning of the season, I’d get 
anxious for my at-bats, and that would be my downfall. Now 
I just step up to the plate and trust my preparation, knowing 
that nobody has worked harder than I have.”

Up next for the Tritons was a three-game battle against No. 
25 Cal State Dominguez Hills, where they fought for a spot in 
the NCAA Division-II West Regional Championship. 

In Friday’s game, the Tritons and Toros battled to an eight 
inning 4-4 stalemate, before UCSD’s offense exploded to life. 
In the top half of the ninth, senior shortstop Vance Albitz set 
the table with a single. Junior outfielder Kyle Saul then hustled

MEN’S TENNIS — Facing a first-round play-
off matchup against No. 29 Brigham Young 
University-Hawaii in Laie, Hawaii, the glory of 
a first-round victory and a subsequent celebra-
tion on the islands in springtime had to have 
crossed the minds of the No. 30 UCSD men’s 
tennis players.

For the second year in a row, the Tritons 
entered their bid for regional supremacy in the 
NCAA Western Regional playoff with a 12-10 
record. Unfortunately for the Tritons, it was also 
the second straight year they were sent home 
from the Aloha State by Hawaiian hosts after 
only one round.

After falling 5-1 to Hawaii Pacific University 
in the first round of regionals last year, the men’s 
tennis team fell to BYU-Hawaii 6-1, and ended 
its season with a 12-11 overall record.

Head coach Eric Steidlmayer said that the 
team’s lack of playoff experience was evident in 
the loss, but that the season was from a disap-
pointment.

“This team has always given a great effort, 
and today was no different,” Steidlmayer said. 
“Challenging BYU-Hawaii again made it evi-
dent that our players lack tournament experi-
ence. The attitude that they’ve had this year and 
helping each other improve during the season 
— those are all positives.”

Coming into the playoff match, UCSD’s 

track record with BYU-Hawaii was not prom-
ising. The Tritons had already fallen to BYU-
Hawaii twice this season prior to the playoff 
confrontation. On Feb. 12, UCSD lost a close 
5-4 matchup to the Seasiders 5-4 during the 
Paseo Tournament in Arizona, and was ham-
mered 7-2 on March 24 on BYU-Hawaii’s home 
court. 

Aside from their unfavorable record against 
BYU-Hawaii, the Tritons entered the playoffs 
on a wave of momentum, having finished with 
an 8-3 record against their divisional oppo-
nents, and claiming the No. 3 seed in the west-
ern region after a 5-4 victory over Sonoma State 
on March 12.

The May 6 showdown began with a trio of 
doubles matches to begin the contest. The No. 2 
UCSD doubles team — junior Armaun Ermami 
and redshirt freshman Austin West — put 
UCSD on the scoreboard with an 8-5 victory 
over No. 2 Seasider doubles pair Andy Xing and 
Agnel Peter. However, the Tritons’ No. 1 team 
of junior Erik Elliot and sophomore Chapman 
Chan — along with No. 3  team sophomores 
Jake Fellow and Sam Ling — lost to Seasider 
opposition, and the Tritons entered the singles 
phase trailing 2-1.

Requiring victories in four of the six remain-
ing singles matches to overturn the deficit and 
clinch a spot in the regional final, the Triton 
looked to their singles players for an unlikely 
upset.

Unfortunately, the Tritons were outmatched, 

and the Seasiders capitalized on their advantage 
in the singles phase. Needing only three victo-
ries to reach five total wins and clinch the best-
of-nine match, BYU-H senior Dillon Porter 
beat UCSD sophomore Sam Ling 6-1, 6-3 in the 
No. 2 singles showdown, giving the Seasiders 
a 3-1 lead. Fellow and UCSD junior captain 
Vincent Nguyen lost at the No. 3 and No. 4 posi-
tions, respectively, to give BYU-H the 5-1 win.

After thee fifth match victory for BYU-
Hawaii, it became unnecessary to play out the 
remaining singles matches. As a result, three 
Triton singles players — Elliot at No. 1, fresh-
man Junya Yoshida at No. 5 and West and No. 
6 — all saw their matches suspended.

“We practiced hard and were preparing for 
the game, but we just didn’t play at out our top 
level,” junior captain Vince Nguyen said. “We 
just didn’t play that well.”

The loss ended the Triton season with a 
12-11 overall record, the same as last year. 
However, since the only upperclassmen on the 
squad were juniors, the team will return next 
season in full force, with greater playoff experi-
ence and poised for a deeper postseason run.

“We get the rest of the year off, but we’re 
going to keep playing,” Nguyen said. “A lot of 
guys will play in tournaments in the summer, 
and then we’ll come back in the school year 
ready to go again.”
