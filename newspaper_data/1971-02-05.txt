Funds for Birth Control Clinic 
Insufficient for UCSD Demand 

Barbara Simon 
Staff Writer 

Due to a heavy demand for services, 
appointments to the birth control clinic at UCSD 
must be made four to six weeks in advance. 

The clinic, one of five organized by the 
Planned Parenthood Association of San Diego, 
was established to serve low income women. 
both married and single, in northern San Diego 
County. According to Mr$. Delores Reyburn, 
R.N ., who is the clinical director, mostly 
students use the clinic, located at the UCSD 
Health Center, on Monday evenings. 

controversy. Many people are rigidly opposed 
to birth control because of their religion, 
explains Mrs. Reyburn. Also, " In the eyes of 
the citizen, there is something not quite 
respectable about Planned Parenthood," says 
Mrs. Laura Viney. Mrs. Viney is the San Diego 
representative of the We tern region of Planned 
Parenthood. (There are seven regional offices 
of Planned Parenthood in the U.S.) Mrs. 
Reyburn laughs at the fact that many men who 
visit the Planned Parenthood office expect the 
taff to be extremely liberal in their per onal 

sex habits. 

"Young" Michael Crichton zaps his audience with a profound Idea as he tells them about mysteries, 
movies , and medicine. Crichton wrote ANDROMEDA STRAIN while studying medicine at 
Harvard aDd Is currently writing screenplays in LA. 

Another evening clinic would be advantageous 
in serving more women, but Mrs. Reyburn says 
that it would only be possible if fees were 
charged to cover the cost of supplies. She hopes 
that the UCSD Health Center will take over the 
services for students because birth control 
"certainly has something to do with a student's 
health." 

A partial explanation for controversy is that 
"our culture looks at sex as dirty, and evil , ., 
says Mrs. Reyburn. Her feeling is that sex is 
good except when people use others for selfish 
reasons. She judges that " the greatest 
disservice we do to young people is not teach 
them about their sexuality." In accord with her 
desire to inform others, Mrs. Reyburn will soon 
relinquish her job and assume the po ition of 
educa tional director. Michael Crichton: 

'Writing and Prostitution ore the 0 n Iy Two 
Fields You (on Engage in Without (opital' 

Dr. Robert Allen, director of student health 
services, is in favor of offering a contraceptive 
clinic through the health center. But he says 
that there is neither space nor money. He 
elaborates that the clinic would have to be at 
night because the health center is already used 
to capacity during the day. 

Also, there is not enough money to pay 
another gynecologist. Dr. Allen says that 
although an inevitable fee charge would pay 
some costs, the funds from the UCSD 
Registration Fee Committee, which completely 
supports the health center, are too low to 
provide additional services .. 

Mrs. Reyburn was recently involved in 
controversy over a sex education lecture she 
gave at a local high school. A couple of 
statistics that he uses in her defense of sex 
education are : 1) illegitimacy has risen 27 per 
cent among middle class whites in the U.S. 
within the past five years: and 2) that one of 
every two teenage girls in California is already 
pregnant when she marries. Juliana Cinque 

Staff Writer 
From medicine to writing to 

movies, Michael Crichton's 
interests have spanned diverse 
fields. Crichton wrote the 
national bestseller, The 
Andromeda Strain, while 
attending Harvard Medical 
School. Recently, his book has 
been made into a movie. Since 
watching the filming of his 
novel, Crichton's interest has 
turned to directing. 

Tuesday evening Crichton 
spoke to some 200 students in 
the Revelle Cafeteria. Prof. 
Jonathan Saville of the 
Literature Department 
introduced him as an exception 
to " the many intellectuals who 
do good work in their field , but 
never leave the beaten track. " 

As Crichton mounted the 
speaker's platform, a girl in 
the audience exclaimed softly, 
"Wow, he 's so young ." 
Crichton began by pointing out 
that he was there to answel' 
questions, not to give a formal 
lecture. 

" Why'd you go to medical 
school if you wanted to be a 
writer?" came the first 
question from the front of the 
room. 

"The question is how am I 
running my life," Crichton 
began. There was laughter. 

A Logical Reason 
" I went into medicine, for 

the only reason an~one wants 
to go into medical school 
does," he paused, "to be a 
doctor. Writing started out as a 
sideline, and somewhere, it 
ended up as the main line." 

There was silence, as no 
fur ther questions from the 
audience were forthcoming. 

" It looks like you want me to 
talk," he surmised. "Right 
now, I'm interested in films," 
he started, speaking with his 
hands in hi pocket . " A book 
requires · a lot of work on the 
part of the reader. A movie 
reduces his work. In that sense 
it's precise, In that sense it' 
boring." 

Crichton elaborated on his 
interest in movie by relating 

veral interesting incident in 
the filming of "The Andromeda 
train." For instance, an 

emerald laser was given a 
screen test. At one point in the 
movie , it was necessary to fill a 
chamber with carbon dioxide. 
"I'm told this place is very 
scientific, so I'll tell you how 
they knew when the chamber 
was full enough of carbon 
dioxide, for those of you who 
haven't guessed already." As 
he spoke, many of the people in 
the audience listened with half-
smiles on their faces. " As the 
gas was pumped in, they had a 
technician walk around with a 
candle. When the candle went 
out they knew there was 
enough carbon dioxide." There 
was laughter. "Of course, the 
technician was higher than the 
candle." More laughter. 

Totally Fictitious 
Concerning the truthfulness 

of his book, Crichton explained 
that he had made it all up , but 
" the people who bought the 
film were under the impression 
that I did a tremendous amount 
of factual work in the field . I 
told them that I made it up, 
which depressed them." 

Many of the questions of the 
audience concerned medicine. 
"In an article, you wrote about 
the problems of medical 
education in America. Would 
you like to tell us what you 
consider to be some of the 
solutions? " asked a 
t>espectacled student. 

"Hell no, but if you want to 
open up tha t ra t' s nest. . ." 
Crichton replied , leaning 
forward from the waist as he 
started to speak, "It's 
distressing to think how easy it 
is to be a doctor, but how tough 
it is to be trained. Being a 
doctor is a lucrative profession 
and you don't want just anyone 
to get it, so you make it tough 
as hell . I don 't want to talk 
about medical education," he 
concluded. 

Earlier in the arternoon, 
Crichton spoke in the Revelle 
Informal Lounge, where he was 
seated on a couch, hi long leg 
resting on a low table . 

"What made you decide to 
write in the first place? " asked 
a girl In the room. 

ADOtiler Locical ReasoD 
"I needed the money, " came 

the quick reply. 
"What made you choose 

writing?" 
Every Child hould Be Wanted 

"It's interesting," he paused, 
"writing and prostitution are 
the only two fields you can 
engage in without capital. And 
I'd never make it as a 
prostitute," he noted with a 
smile that made everyone 
laugh. 

Further questions revealed 
that Crichton's interest in 
writing was more serious than 
his wit would make it seem. 
For instance, he had been doing 
serious writing since he \Vas 13. 
Furthermore, his success for 
various reasons was hindering 
his further writing. ' 

Since the first clinic opened in January of 
1968, Planned Parenthood has paid for the 
doctors, nurses, and contraceptive supplies. 
For every dollar .contributed to Planned 
Parenthood in San Diego, the federal 
government gives three dollarS. The major 
problem, says Mrs. Reyburn, is that "local 
contributions are not enough to meet the needs J 
of the community." 

In response to the charge that sex education 
and birth control lead to promiscuity, Mrs. 
Reyburn gives this statistic : under one per cent 
of the 4,500 patients seen in the past two years 
were virgins. The services of Planned 
Parenthood are to educate the young in birth 
control rather than to encourage a exual 
revolution . 

The theme of Planned Parenthood is that 
"every child should be a wanted child." 

eighborhood counseling is provided to help 
married women in family planning. Planned 
Parenthood also provides pregnancy and 
abortion counseling. In addition, referrals are 
made to private physicians, venereal disease 
clinics, an Diego public health clinics, and

Classroom Inddent Brings TA 'Threat 
John Zaller 
Staff Writer 

Third College Provost Joseph Watson has han ned one student 
from Communications IB and given warnings to three others 
following a classroom disruption last Wednesday. Later, most 
of the college's TA's signed a petition stating that they would 
stop meeting with their classes if another such disruption 
occurred. 

The incident took place in a recitation of the basic 
communications course required of all Third College 
freshmen. A Black male student, who i not a member of the 
college, got into a heated discussion with his female Chicano 
TA over the "appropriateness" of an examination question. 
Tensions increased, and the student called hi TA a "fucking 
asshole." She asked him to leave, h refu d, and £hen th TA 
left. 

Provost Watson learned of the incident that afternoon, along 
with the names of three other students who had previou ly 
argued in the clas room with their in tructors over the 
"direction" and "appropriatene " of cour material. 

tudents Di clpllned 
The same afternoon Wat on began to contact the four 

students. The one involved in Wedn sday' incident wa told h 
would no longer be admitted to th cour e; a cond tudent, 
also not a member of the college, was a ked to stop attending 
the course. A third student, a regular member of th cour , 
was told h would be banned from the our if hi behavior 
continued; and a fourth , also a member of the cour , wa ' told 
that while hi action were not consid red "disruptive," h 
should nevertheles expres his con ern about th cour in a 
more appropriate manner. 

The next day Watson told th ntire cour in lecture that 
there "could not be any mor di ruption . In clion, it i th 

TA's who will decide what is to be covered and what will be the 
activities of the class." 

TA's Present Petition 

The following Monday, Feb. 1, Third College TA's, including 
those not associated directly with ommunication lB, 
presented a petition stating that they would not meet with their 
classes if there were any more di ruptions. 

The petition went on to demand that faculty " undermining" 
of the TA's po ition be topped, stres ing that thi complaint 
could not be reduced to a imple "confhct of personalitie ."

Gonorrhea Slt~rocketing 

Dr. Allen Tells of VO Dangers 
J.ff Graham 
Slaff Wril.r 

Recently much pUblicity has 
been focused on the growing 
problem of venereal disease, 
but perhaps not enough, the 
TRITON TIMES was told by 
Student Health Center 
officials. Dr. Robert Allen, 
director of the center, said that 
while the average number of 
syphilis cases reported 
annlllllly remains constant, the 
incidence of gonorrhea is 
skyrocketing . Campus figures 

are kept essentially 
confidential, but it was learned 
that the Health Center 
diagnoses about 12 cases a 
year, and treats an 
undetermined number without 
making a final diagnosis. 

San Diego county residents 
reported 3,744 cases of 
gonorrhea last year, a 32 per 
cent rise over the 1969 total of 
2,829. The median number of 
treatments given over the last 
five years is only 1600. While 
this is but a small fraction of 
the 1,354,000 people living in 
San Diego County, medical 

officials believe that onl y about 
10 per cent of the cases get 
treated. Seventy-two per cent 
of treatments are administered 
to people under 24 years of age. 

Doctor Allen emphasized the 
importance of quick medical 
treatment in cases of venereal 
disease. In its tertiary stage, 
syphilis attacks the central 
nervous system and the blood 
vessels. The possible 
consequences of gonorrhea 
include sterility in women. The 
disease can go unnoticed until 
the entire pelvic region has 

become inflamed. Repeated 
cases of venereal disease are 
especially destructive to 
internal organs. An especially 
tragic but poorly known aspect 
of syphilis is the effect it can 
have on unborn children. A 
fetus in an infected mother 
may contract blindness, 
deafness, heart disease and 
other birth defects. 

Muir Health Foods Store Forced to (lose 

With the stakes so high, why 
do so many people neglect 
treatment? Dr. Allen cited 
ignorance as one reason. 
Significant numbers of people 
do not know that all medical 
records concerning venereal 
disease are kept strictly 
confidential ; and that a newly 
passed law in California allows 
any doctor to treat a minor for 
venereal disease without 
informing his parents. Medical 
au thorities believe that 
increasing numbers of people 
attempt to treat themselves for 
venereal disea se with 
penicillin, obtained in Mexico 
or elsewhere . New, more 
resistant strains of venereal 
disease are immune to all but 
very massive doses of drugs, 
making this self-medication 
ineffective.

The health food section of the Muir snack bar 
has been discontinued because of lack of 
customers, according to the manager of the 

which has resulted from this year 's food plan. It 
is a policy of the food service to eliminate 
segments of the operation that do not support 
themselves, and for this reason the health foods 
were dropped. 

Muir cafeteria. . 
Opened in the middle of last year's Winter 

Quarter in response to a student petition, the 
health bar carried items usually priced below 
those in most health stores and did well until 
reopened this Fall . Larry Bonafide, Muir 
cafeteria manager, attributes the decline in 
interest to the " tight money" script situation 

Since cutbacks in cafeteria service have 
resulted from many students' preference for 
doing their own cooking, the future of cafeteria 
services is uncertain. Currently a Muir poll on 
the food service is being taken. One question 
asks whether students would be interested in a 
small grocery store on campus, which would 
make it more convenient for students to cook 
for themselves.

Students May be Part of Academic Senate 
-Bart Fisher, ASUCSD president, will submit a proposal to 

the Regents to add students to the committees.of the Academic 
Senate including committees concerned With courses and curric~lum . This new rIan comes from the President's 
Council, which consists 0 all UC student bodv presidents. The 
idea for the plan originally came from ASUCLA's President 
Keith Schiller. . 

The basic problem in obtaining student representation on 
these committees involves amending the standing orders of the 
Academic Senate. At the present time, the standing orders 
regarding membership on committees does not mention 
students. It has therefore been interpreted to exclude students 
as voting members of committees. Students may attend the 
meetings, however. . 

Fisher Schiller and other members of the PreSident's 
Council 'hope to work with the Regents Committee on 
Educational Policy and with President Hitch to change the 
wording of tbe orders in a way which will allow students to 
become voting members of the committees.

of requests for funds have already been received. They include 
a proposal to build a handicraft center and a printing company. 

Some funds have already been promised to The Methadone

Assembly Clears 3rd College lows 
John Zoller 

Stoff Writer 

Third College Assembly 
Tuesday night completed work 
on by-laws that will govern 
operation of the college . 
Approval was given to roughly 
the second half of a three page 
document that has been under 
consideration by the Assembly 
since November. 

The by-laws are not yet 
ready, however, for final 
approval by mail ballot. The 
Asse mbly also voted 
overw helmingly to 
"reconsider" the controversial 
provision of the by-laws that 
spec ifies election and 
~omposition of the college 
Board of Directors at another 

full meeting. 
Most of the Tuesday meeting 

was devoted to discussion of 
the composition and election of 
the standing committees 
specified under the by-laws. 
The committees-on 
curri culum, admissions, 
construction and design , 
co mmunity relations 
will normally make the key 
advisory decisions in their 
respective areas. 

There were three basic 
proposals. One would have 
elected the members of each 
committee at large, without 
specific reference to racial 
composition . The second 
proposal would have set 

election of the committee 
members on the same basis as 
election of the Board of 
Governors (one Black , one 
Chicano, one Asian·American, 
and one American Indian, each 
elected by his/her respecti ve 
ethnic group ). The third 
proposal , which finally passed 
22-12, provides for election of 
committee member s In 
multiples of three, depending 
on the size of the committee, at 
the rate of one Black, one 
Chicano, and one "other", with 
each representative elected by 
his /her respective ethnic 
group. 

JSA Celebrates Tu B'Shevat 
The additional Assembly 

meeting to reconsider the 
mode of filling the Board of 
Directors of the college was 
welcomed by Watson, who 
voted against the 
provision at the last meeting 
because, he said, it was 
"exclusionary" to whites. " I 
think there is a general feeling 
tha t people would like to 
change this arrangement," 
Watson said . 

Ea ch year as a 
commemoration of the first 
budding of trees in Israel and 
as an expression of their love 
for na tu re and recogn i tion of 
its importance in their daily 
lives, Jews all over the world 
plant young saplings. In 
keeping with this tradition, the 
Jewish Students Association at 
UCS D is preparing a 
celebration of Tu B'Shevat, the 
New Year of Trees. 

Beginning this Saturday 
eveni ng at 8:00 P.M., in the 
Revellp. Informal Lounge, 
there will be a discussion of the 
importance of conservation of 
natural resources as described 
in the Torah, followed by 
festivities including Israeli folk 
dancing, food drink . Also that 
eveni ng, a short talk will be 
given by Sandy Clark, UCSD's 
Grou nds Supervisor , 
concerning future plans for the 
landscaping of Muir College.

The observance o( Tu 
B'Shevat will end with a tree 
planting ceremony, Sunday 
afternoon at one o'clock near 
the handball courts adjacent to 
the gym. The ceremony will be 
conducted by several members 
of JSA . The UCSD community 
at large, is invited to attend 
and participate in this 
celebration of Tu B'Shevat, the 
Jewish New Year of Trees. 

The Board of Directors will 
be, acco:ding to the By-laws, 
the highest executive agency of 
the college ; while the provost 
will have responsibility as the 
highest administrative officer 
of the college. 

Thus the By-laws, when put 
into operation, will give 
students representation at 
virtua lI y every level of 
opera tion of the college. 

The Board of Directors, as 
presently outlined, will contain 
four students, four faculty, and 
the provost.

Youth Culture 'Narcissistic' 
PhD Candidate Clayton Says 

Kathy Rust 
Stoff Writer 

David Clayton, a UCSD Ph.D. candidate in 
literature, recently described today's youth 
culture as " narcissistic" and characterized by 
an " introverted, paranoic view of the world." 

Clayton, speaking to a University Extension 
course entitled "The Radical Press," read a 
paper describing his reaction to the youth 
culture. The paper was inspired by the 
"despicable" reaction of a UCSD audience to 
the French film, "The Children of Paradise ," 
which was shown last year in USB 2722. 

Clayton's analysis of the youth culture 
revealed that today's youth suffers from an 
inability to accept any cul ture removed from 
their own. This inability is part of the 
" narcissism" prevalent in the youth culture. 
The crucial question is, he claims, " Is 
narcissism a sufficient basis for culture?" 

No Active Involvement 

In Clayton 's opinion , the typical youth of 
today would rather " just sit and let a movie 
bombard him" than become involved in the 
action. Similarly, Clayton feels that the modern 
psychedelic art does not require the viewer to 
use his imagination. It bombards his senses 
with "an excess of information" instead. 

One of the characteristics of the youth 
culture, according to Clayton, is an emphasi on 
the spirit of community. "This notion of the 
tribe is not a new concept. It comes from the 
bourgeois idea of a classless society." Clayton 
feels that the communi ty spirit has failed . He 
cites the Rolling Stones' concert at Altamont 
Speedway as " the most obvious example of the 
failure of community spirit. " 

Clayton mentioned the ecology movement as 
a movement which is popular because the entire 
spectrum of youth, from radical to reactionar!', 
can participate to protest the " rape of mother 
earth." He says, "The ecology movement does 

not involve a confrontation with the abyss of 
youth 's own bourgeois nature.-' He added, 
however, that the fact that everyone can get 
together about ecology is not necessarily a 
recommendation. " After all:' he commented , 
"Germany in the '30's was known to have had 
very clean streets." 

TT Hypocritical 

He described the TRITON TIMES edition on 
ecology as "a panegyric on toilet training" and 
was surprised that the TT did not put 
"Cleanliness is next to Godliness" on the front 
page. He feels that the IT is being hypocritical 
when it proclaims the virtues of the ecology 
movement while simultaneously advertising 
King Snedley's beer. He asks, "Where do they 
think all those beer cans are going to go?" 

One of the unusual aspects of the youth 
culture, according to Clayton, is that very little 
of it is a product of the youth. He contrasts it 
with the Black culture which was created hy 
Blacks within their own situation. 

A Paranoic View 

Clayton says that one of the elements 
common to many of the youth culture's most 
popular movies is that the heroes have a 
paranoic view of life. He finds this paranoic 
attitude in "The Graduate. " " Easy Rider ," and 
"Alice's Restaurant. " 

Clayton said that it might be more accurate to 
speak of "youth market" rather than a "youth 
culture." The creation of the youth market was 
the logical sol u tion to the problem of over-
production in the consumer society in which we 
live. 

"The isolation of youth is a result of their 
acceptance of the youth culture which has been 
forced upon them." Clayton says that the first 
step the typical youth of today must make to 
free himself is to ask himself, " Why am I 
isolated?" and then to try to work out his own 
solution to the problem. 

UC5DBudge' 
UCSD next year will receive more state funds than last year, 

but the funding will not increase' proportionately with the 
increase in students, Chancellor Herbert York recently told the 
TRITON TIMES. 

York explained that while Governor Reagan's proposed 
budget keeps UC allocations at the same level as this year's 
budget, the monies are allocated on a per-stUdent basis. Since 
UCSD is increasing in size relative to the other campuses, it 
will receive a greater share. 

Budget figures for individual campuses probably will not. 
however, be released for at least a week. The only certain 
information in this regard is that UCSD will receive 24 new 
faculty full-time-equivalent positions.

AS PR Director Butler 
Ponders Info Problems 

Ed Boyle 
Sloff Wriler 

As Associated Students 
Public Relations Director, 
Barbie Butler's job is to 
distribute information from the 
AS government to the students, 
and hopefully, also to serve as 
a channel of communication 
between the students and the 
AS Council. 

According to Barbie , the first 
quarter under the new 
constitution was largely spent 
learning the potentialities of 
the commissionerships. She is 
now working on establishing a 
regular means for distribution 
of AS information, possibly a 
newsletter or a regular section 
in the TRITON TIMES. Such a 
newsletter would include brief 
reports from the 
commissioners and from the 
committees on which the AS is 
represented . It would alSo 
include a financial report, and 
perhaps questions concerning 
student interest in potential AS 
activities. 

She is also looking into the 
possibility of preparing an 
orientation booklet for 
incoming studen ts. Such a 
booklet is given at UC Santa 
Barbara, where new students 
are thus introduced to the Isla 
Vista life-style, and are told 
about the agencies and 
facilities available to students, 
places to go, things to do, and 
in general about where their 
money will be going. 

When asked whether the 
commissioner system, set up to 
remedy the disorganization of 
past AS governments, was 

working, Barbie replied that it 
generally was , but that 
unfamiliarity with the way 
such a system could work and 
student apathy have so far 
prevented it from reaching its 
potential. She pointed out that 
the system gives students the 
opportunity to discuss 
particular concerns with a 
person who knows something 
about the matter, and who has 
some idea of what can be done 
about it. Unfortunately, few 
students have taken advantage 
of this opportunity. 

Barbie sees the role of the AS 
government as concerning 
itself with the welfare of the 
students. It does this by 
offering facilities (including 
money ) for student activities. 
For example, the AS has 
sponsored campus-wide 
entertainment and has funded 
groups such as the soaring 
club. It also aids in alleviating 
any problems. Students should 
make the AS solve the 
problems UCSD gives them. 

Barbie acknowledges that 
the AS often does not relate to 
the students but notes that the 
students don't relate to the AS 
either , failing to take 
advantage of its potential for 
carrying out ideas or solving 
problems. 

Barbie encourages students 
to come to the AS with any 
suggestions, ideas, or 
complaints concerning life at 
UCSD, either through the AS 
office at 250 MC or through the 
individual commissioners.

Planned Parenthood ... 
(continued from page 1) 

clinics for military personnel. 
New Patients Hear Lecture 

New patients at the Planned Parenthood hear 
a lecture which discusses both male and female 
reproductive organs and all modern methods of 
birth control. Many men come along to the 
clinic and listen to the lectures. Mrs. Reyburn 
sees an ideal arrangement in birth control as 
the responsibility of both the male and the 
female. A specific example she gives is use of 
the condom and foam , which also prevents the 
spread of venereal disease. 

On the wall opposite the entrance of the 
Planned Parenthood office at 14th and B streets 
is a picture of Margaret Sanger, pioneer in birth 
control. Fifty years ago she began the first 
clinic , which was located in New York. Because 
dissemination of birth control information was 
prohibited, she went to jail six times 

As a result of her efforts and a growing 
interest in the movement, the Planned 
Parenthood Association of America was 
established in 1961. As their other title , Planned 
Parenthood-World Population, implies, the 
organization is concerned with the world 
population crisis. It is a supporter of an 
international organization which helps provide 
birth control services in more than 100 
countries.

UCSD Receives S 13 Million in Grants 
Research grants and contracts totalling nearly 13 million 

dollars were awarded to UCSD during the last quarter of 1970. 
Approximately 100 awards were made by governmental 

agencies during the period. Most of the funding came from 
federal sources, with the greatest number stemming from the 
National Science Foundation and the Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare. Several grants were made by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of 
Naval Research and the Atomic Energy Commission. 

Several major projects were funded at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. Among these were " Deep Flow, 
Water Characteristics, Topography and Sediments in the Area 
between New Zealand and Antarctica ;" "Circadian and Tidal 
Rhythms ;" " Geology and Geomorphology of Melanesia and 
the South Central Pacific," and "Study of Deep Circulation and 
Deep Fish Popula tions in the Pacific Ocean." 

School of Medicine projects receiving support during the 
quarter included " Mechanics of Contraction in the Intact 
Heart," "Chromosome Function in Sex-Linked Disease," 
"Radiation Measurements of Radiological Hazards of Man in 
Space," and " Gene Expression and Its Modification." 

Teacher-Evaluation 
A Long Time Coming? 

According to Jim Sills, AS commissioner of academic 
affairs, the some 2,500 teacher evaluation forms which were 
distributed several weeks ago will not be used to make a 
teacher evaluation guide. The forms, which solicited student 
opinion on instructor's lecture stvle, reading, exams, etc., 
brought several hundred replies which Commissioner Sills 
hoped to print a guide from. 

The AS Council, on the recommendation of President Mike 
Palcic, refused to grant Sills the funds to print the guide. 

It was explained that not enough careful tholight was given 
by Sills to develop a thorough evaluation criterion. A special 
Teacher Evaluation Committee will hopefully perform the job. 
Says Sills , "This is another example of AS President Palcic's 
maniacal drive to oversee and control every AS project." Sills 
also claims the special committee will never have the 
initiative to carry out its purpose. 

Today the Moon 
Tomorrow the Solar System 

While Apollo 14 is orbi ling the moon next week, several 
- UCSD scientists and other space experts will be talking about a 

visit to an asteroid. A second UCSD space conference will be 
held on Monday at 1:30 in the afternoon to discuss with 
newsmen the possibility of unmanned spacecraft missions to 
the asteroid Eros as ea rly as 1975. The purpose of the mission 
would be to obtain samples of the asteroid which would 
hopefully explain better the origin of the solar system. 

The mission is made feasible by the development of a solar-
electric powered spacecraft which would be capable of long 
trips such as this one. Eros is almost 14 million miles away 
from earth, and the round trip would take around 3 years. 

Among the scientists discussing the mission on Monday will 
be Dr. Hannes Alfven, 1970 Nobel Prize winner in physics, and 
Dr. Gustaf Arrhenius, UCSD professor of Oceanography. The 
conference will be held in Conference Room "A", Matthews 
campus. 

Revolution to be Discu ed 

George Lakey, who sailed thi ketch Phoenix with medical 
supplies to North Vielnam in 1967 and later attempted, 
unsuccessfully, to land similar supplies in South Vietnam, will 
speak Monday on " non-violent revolution." He is the co-author 
of A Meaningful Direct Action with Martin Oppenheimer and 
the author of Strategy for a Living Revolution which will be 
published this Spring. Lakey is associated with the American 
Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia. He will speak at 4 
p.m. in Bldg. 2A, room 2113.

La Jolla's 'Coast Walk' 
May Be The Next To Go 

Some sunny day- or some 
quiet evening-wander on down 
to La Jolla and take a walk. Go 
to the Cave Store, just down the 
hill from the junction of Cave 
Street and Prospect. There is a 
trail there, the Coast Walk , 
leading east along the clifftops. 

At this time of year, the sides 
of the trail are overgrown with 
new grass. You can walk for a 
while , or sit down in the tall 
oats and watch the cormorants 
and seagulls squabbling on the 
cliff. The trail is a 
very relaXing, quiet avenue. 
begin ning in a grove of Torrey 
Pines at the Cave Store and 
ending in -yo ur 
choice-Pro peet Street or 
Torrey Pines Road. It's not a 
long trail , but you can still be 
many figurative miles from 
town and crowded streets if 
you just let yourself relax. 

Unfortunately , the Coast 
Walk may not be there much 
longer. It has officially been a 
city right-Of-way since the end 
of the last' century. Now it looks 
like some bored city engineers, 
probably on a slow Friday 
afternoon , could find nothing 
better to do than to think up 
building a road along the 
clifftops. 

One of the excu es given for 
this proposal is weak- the 
easing of the Cave Street-
Prospect Street traffic 
problem . The other 
justification is all too familiar , 
in La Jolla and everywhere 
else-people with commercial 
interests, pushing for rezoning 
in the area, want to be sure of 
easy access to their new 
businesses. 
. La Jolla has a reputation as 

one of the most beau tif u I towns 
in the state , and remains 
beautiful now in spite of the 
other new roads and the 
cancerous growth of the 
housing projects. 

Take a walk along the Coast 
Walk. Go out there with a 
friend , maybe- it's a nice 
place for two people. And when 
you are pretty well into the 
quiet and cool ocean air. 
imagine yourself on a sidewalk 
with Saturday night traffic 
roaring past you . You should 
get angry enough to write a 
letter to Mayor Curran and the 
City Council. Tell them you 'd 
rather keep the Coast Walk as a 
path, not a highway. If we can 
make enough noise now. while 
the Coast Walk road is only an 
Idea, perhaps the idea will 
never become anything more.

Mad Dogs and Englishmen 
It seems that we now have arrived at 

the point where Mr. Nixon feels that his 
office allows him to act entirely 
without the advice and consent of 
either the Congress or the people of this 
country . The events of the past few 
weeks accent this point. Using 
semantics, the Defense , Department 
has gone ahead with an escalation of 
the war in Cambodia and just this week 
under the cover of a news blackout it 
seems that we are participating in 
what may be a full scale invasion of 
Laos. 

Using the very tactics that he 
decried in his predecessors - lies, and 
distortions, Nixon's government has 
completely ignored the wishes of 
constituency. Th is constituency, 
through the Congress had made its 
wishes known - no further increase in 
the scope of the Asian war. The so-
called Nixon Doctrine has disappeared 
and it seems as if we have returned full 
cycle to the administration of LBJ . Not 
only has Nixon proposed a similar 
budgetary policy but he has returned to 
the same bloody ground where Johnson 
sent thousands of our men to die in 
vain. 

The time has come, we feel, for 
Congress to act. No longer can it 
simply slap the President's hands-this 
time they must be severed. The way to 
curb these irresponsible actions Is to 
entirely remove all funding from the 
President's military adventures. This 
drastic measure is necessary because 
it has been shown over the past two 
years that neither Nixon or his ad· 
visors can be trusted. Nixon, Laird and 
Mitchell have all proven themselves to 
be untrustworthy and acting towards 
some end other than the betterment of 
the majority of the people of this 
country. 

If Congress fails to act, they will 
have betrayed not only their con-
stituency, but themselves. There is no 
action too strong to be considered. The 
alternatives to strong action are too 
grim to contemplate. Nixon must he 
chained and muzz1ed before his 
irresponsible actions put us ' in In· 
dochina for yet another ten years. 

There is a saying that only mad dogs 
and Englishmen stay out in the midday 
sun. Nixon has been out in the sun too 
much of late, and by no stretch of the 
immagination is he an Englishman.

Contemporary Issues 

The Longest 
Revolution 

Ann Keener 

Nearly seventy human beings, glowing with the rarified 
bloom of womanhood, as well as a scattering of males, sat in 
rapt attention, waiting to be informed of the latest oppressions 
perpetrated upon womankind-in a phrase, the male chauvinist 
pigs (the first two oppressions were committed by nature ). 

Having enrolled in the Contemporary Issues course, 
"Women, the Longest Revolution," my first bona fide women's 
liberation class, I had come, like many others, to be liberated. 
Liberation, however, is an active, not passive process directed 
by a set of well-defined goals oriented towards gaining greater 
freedom for a particular individual. These minimal 
constituents are lacking in the so-called Woman's Liberation 
Movement as envinced by the class I now attend. 

It becomes increasingly obvious as the course progresses 
that few of the people involved, including the so-called 
instructors, have any idea of what they would like to 
accomplish. One lecture was delivered directly from several 
pages of "notes" held firmly in front of the nose, from 
beginning to end. Another was spent in long periods of 
attempted recollection of what was said in the speaker's 
anthropology class dated several years earlier. 

T.A. Shows Poor Memory 

My own T.A. often has great difficulty in making statements 
conducive to becoming liberated, since she can never keep 
straight which leaders said what. In each case, these people 
seem to lack a backbone on which to hang their beliefs and 
therefore must rely on memorizing the words of their worthy 
mentors. I often wonder in such cases if they are seeking 
justification in background literature for their cause, or if they 
are seeking a cause for justification. 

This is not to say that there aren' t problems that need to be 
resolved. ( agree that women hired to do the same work as men 
should have the same salary. I draw the line at making the 
employer hire women rather than men, or designating a 
certain percentage of women to hire. ( feel that this is a 
province shared by the employer and the employees, and 
outside intervention should not be encouraged. Furthermore, 
hiring women in preference to men solely as a result of this 
liberation movement would be a male restriction rather than a 
female liberation. 

Female Loses OD AggressiveDess 

During one of my TA's brilliant flashes of coherent 
memory, she mentioned a girlfriend whose husband had gotten 
the job that they had simultaneously applied for, although she 
felt better qualified since she had two Phd.'s, whereas he had 
only one. The reason given for his acceptance and her 
disqualification was that she was I)ot aggressive enough. She 
claims that society repressed her aggressivity and she 
therefore should be judged solely on the basis of her academic 
qualifications. Dr. Newmark looks well-<lualified on paper .... 

These unshaven, " liberated" women sicken me with their 
sacrifice of individuality and self-respect in an attempt to be 
just as good as men in every way. Any man who considers 
each one of his feminine cohabitants on this earth a piece of 
meat, is to be totally ignored. Obviously, he has the overload of 
meat- between the ears. ( do not believe that it is the 
responsibility of the self· fulfilled individual to acquiesce to or 
rebel against this man 's concepts. To do so would only 
acknowledge a serious lack of discrimination on the part of the 
individual. 

WomeD's Lib-Miserable Hoax 

Well girls, there you have it. As far as I am concerned, 
Women's Liberation is a miserable hoax. No one is going to be 
liberated . Liberation is not a passive process, one must think 
liberated in order to enjoy its benefits. Instead, we are being 
shown how to be "just-as-good" as the men are. We shall gain 
the right to ·cultivate ulcers in a competitive society or 
anonymity in a non·competitive one. 

Yes, anonymity, for in the much heralded, " liberated" 
socialist society, each job is just as important as the next. 
You're each going to get one, whether you like it or not, 
deserve it or not. And what self·fulfillment there is in cleaning 
sewers, I find difficult to realize. 

How do you wish to be qualified in your newly liberated 
state- scrabbling bureaucrat or a cog in the machinery? Will 
this choice make you equal enough? Will you have now become 
a true individual because you, a woman, have raised yourself 
to the ultimately meaning provinces of the male cast? Then 
take you r pick. ( wash my hands.

Correction 
I wish to be disassociated 

from the remarks of Professor 
Avrum Stroll, reported in your 
Jan.29 issue in connection with 
-the telegram sent to 
Ambassador Dobrynin, of 
which ( was also a signatory. 
My signature was certainly not 
intended to endorse the 
proposition that the Soviet 
Union is an "evil place," and I 
would have refused to sign had 
I realized that the telegram 
would be used for such anti· 
Soviet propaganda purposes, 
which play into the worst 
forces in American life. 

Anti-Semitism is 
abominable , but it is only one 
of the many forms of injustice 
at work in the world today ; and 
there is something cheap and 
facile about such complacent 
denunciation of the sins of 
other people and other 
countries. The telegram, in my 
opinion, was addressed to the 
oviet government and not 

the American people, 
would do better to reserve 
indignation for the crimes of ' 
own government, both at 
and abroad.

(n the two and one-half years 

Opinion 

since I have been on this 
campus the social sciences and 
the humanities have gone from 
bright hope to dismal prospect, 
from "certain commitments of 
excellence" and of "definite 
numbers of FTE's" from the 
administrators to FTE 's 
controlled by totally 
unquaHfied people, and from 
"definite ,commitments to a 
balanced program" to plans for 
a more unbalanced program. 
Some of this has been 
precipitated by the terrible 
plague of campus-politics 
which so ou traged the public, 
but none of it has been a 
necessary consequence of that. 
There are individual 
administrators making . the 
decisions that are 
progressively dooming our 
disciplines and our students to 
complete mediocrity. 

If we do not unite in our 
efforts to stop them, regardless 
of our other differences , we 
shall see only more mediocrity 
at UCSD. If we do unite, I am 
certain that we shall have the 
support of most of the 
engineers and scientists, who 
do not want mediocre people, 
and of the vast majority of 
students, who do not want to be 
narrow·minded specialists fed 
"bullshit" by phoney soc ial 
scientists and humanists. Let 
us make an all·out effort to 
reverse all of these policies 
immediately. If we fail , we can 
at least 'Ieave with the 
knowledge that we fought the 
courageous and honorable 
battle. 

Women: Christ Will 
Liberate You 

Cyndi Tifft 

Once again a segment of mankind has risen up in anger and 
determination and declared that it is oppressed, and is 
demanding its rights. Women are frustrated and dissatisfied 
with takin~ second place in "this land of opportunity." 

All our lIves society has been channeling us into the role of 
wife, mother and homemaker. But where does individuality 
come in? What about those of us who can't conform to the all· 
American dream of two kids and a Better Homes aDd GlrdeDs 
house? (~ that all the~e i.s? ~hy train for a better'paying job 

~hen socIety saysyou re InferIor and that the woman 's place is 
In the home, tendmg the Sick, or behind a typewriter? Are we 
n?thing. more than disposable sex toys to be used once, then 
dIscarded as man moves on to bigger and better heights? 

The same incentives which drive men to leave their mark on 
the face of society quell responsively in the heart of women. 
This stifling of women in an age of progress has resulted in 
hate, prejudice, and tragedy. 

So ~he.re do we begin? Would it be that easy to abolish sex 
exploltal1on or to change man's tastes and desires? If women 
dropped the title of " housewife" and husbands started to help 
around the house, would that make wives any more satisfied 
enthusiastic about their role, make them more complete? wili 
better jobs and more money really make women more relaxed, 
more content, more self-actualized? Are we sure that with all 
this we could truly be h~ppy or content, or would we wind up 
Just beIng bored from a different perspective? 

Since the needs are farbelow the surface, no change in the 
syste~ , nO.r In laws, nor In the economy, nor in symbols, not 
even m attItudes cantruly,thorooghly liberate. The Bible says, 
"I.f any man (or woman ) is in Christ, he is a new crea ture ; old 
thtngs are passed away, behold, new things have come." 
CertaInly nothIng can be more liberating than to be rid of all 
previous "values," misconceptions, deeds, and memories and 
to start anew , with the very source of liberty dwelling in you. 

Unlike many of the eastern religious leaders, Jesus was a 
propone~t of women 's liberation, preaching the equality of 
women In an age when women were considered little better 
than animals. 

In a personal relationship with Jesus Christ the single girl 
need not feel only half a person until marriage. It is not a 
husband that completes a woman, it is Jesus Christ. Just as 
Si ngle life in Christ is an adventure, so is a marriage founded in 
Jesus Christ. . It is two renewed individuals supporting each 
other, s~rpnsIn~ each other and not suppressing each other. 

T'!e lIfe tha.t IS. controlled, empowered and enriched by the 
SpirIt of ChrIst IS a constant adventure. If you are in the 
perfect will of God, you are truly liberated! 

Jim Sills 

Politician as Recluse? 
Vincent Hollier 

Poor Jim Sills! Why doesn 't he get off this 
campus and find out what the real world is 
do!ng, rather than laying up in this pocket of no-
thmk. Clearly from the tone of Mr. Sills ideas 
and views on the world, he's never been 
nowhere (sic ), or done nothing, or really even 
exoerienced life as it flows around UCSD. Sills 
cries about the left doing this and the left doing 
that, but let's face it, whether your're left, 
right, or whatever else you wantto call yourself, 
America is an evil M.F., and the evil you 
perceive 'is in direct proportion to how many 
layers you are down in the American thing. 

The physical world operates off a cause·and· 
effect relationship. The left is the effect of a 
cause generated by America herself. The 
movement we see in this country couldn't exist 
in a vacuum- as a matter of fact, America has 
had countless numbers of opportunities to rid 
herself of this "left" if she wanted to. But 
America could not rid herself of this because 
she is afraid to change. But, as Sills knows, as 
Jack Douglas knows, and as DIMENSION 
knows, change is going to come-just as sure as 
the warm sun rises after a cold long dark night. 
In fact, the change is going to have to come. 

Sills may cry out about how there are 
countries in the world where so-called left-wing 
and socialistic governments are in power, and 
how things have been so bad since these 
governments have been in power, but what we 

h~ve going here in AmerIca is categorically 
dIfferent from anything happening in the 
world-today, yesterday, or any other time. 

The form that change will take in this country 
is now being born in the minds of imaginative 
people all over the continent. Bits and pieces 
(the better ones) of governmental economic and 
social systems throughout history will be drawn 
upon to make a better, more human type of 
direction for the future . 

I tell you, never before has man and this small 
world been faced with the problems put before 
it now. Unprecedented situations call for 
unprecedented thoughts and actions. I refuse to 
fall back upon the institutions of the past-What 
was good for the past was good for the past! 
Instead, build, change. The world changes, 
things change, so why shouldn't people change? 

"Recluse" DefiDed 

In the article about Mr. Sills, he was titled as 
"The Politicianas recluse." So I went ahead and 
lDl,>ked u'p . ~e word recluse, and came up with 
thIS defInItIon : Recluse (1) One who lives in 
retirement or seclusion. (2) One who retires 
from intercourse with the world, as a religious 
devotee; specifically, one who lives shut up in a 
cell, and practices exceptional austerities. 

l 
/ 

/ * / 
./ 

This is the problem- Mr. Sills and so many 
others like him, live penned up in prisons of 
their own design. It is correct for Mr. Sills to 
say his life only has meaning to him as a 
function of the United States of America . It's 
the American way to remain detached from 
other humans, from the world ; from oneself. 

In talking to Sills, I get the impression he's 
never formed any meaningful bonds, or ever 
had any deep feelings for another person or 
persons in all of his 21 years upon this earth. 
Cold, dry and impersonal , the "watchdog of 
Third College" grimly goes about his thankless 
task of making UCSD safe for loyal Americans. 

Racism is No Joke 

Now that brings up the question of race : Mr. 
Sills claims in his article that he's a racist. He 
says its a smokescreen , a joke, designed to 
inflame people who do not understand the real 
Jim Sills. Well I say he 's a fool! Racism is no 
joke to me-its no joke to any thinking Black, 
Brown, Red , Yellow, or any other person who's 
had the misfortune to come in contact with the 
almighty United States. No, Sills isn't joking-he is a racist, and lip service to the 1964 
Civil Rights Act or other meaningless 
governmental acts does not change that fact. 

From the tone of Jim Sills ideas (The Girl 
who Had Everything, article on Angela Davis) I 
can see that the poor fellow is still locked into 
that type of thought that was popular when 
lynching Black people was in style. Mr. Sills is a 
racist out of ignorance, no more no less. 
Having never gone through a fraction of what 
Blacks and Browns experience everyday, and 
having based his conclusions like most people at 
this school upon second-hand opinions or sterile 
statistics, Sills feels qualified to tell you what 
Blacks think, how they feel , what they're going 
to eat tomorrow, etc. etc. etc. 

Sills Not Evil-Just Comused 

There is a saying in the Yin-Yang that nothing 
in the universe is either totally good or totally' 
bad. This is true with Sills-he's not an evil 
man- just confused. But I think Mr. Sills' 
confusion will soon be at a crossroads. There 
are some strong events coming down in the near 
future that will decide the fate of America and 
of the whole world. The sham will be over and 
people will be called upon to act for real. 
Everybody will be in this one. No one will be left 
out. The watchword will be change- change for 
the better, movement upwards- progression. 
Change will be the watchword, Mr. Sills. Will 
you be able to cha nge?

"More and more people have 
taken up interest in the last few 
games." Tbe coach declared 
that sports would be even more 
of a success if mort! students 
would turn out, and that the 
best way to draw more 
students would be to build a 
team tha t the school could be 
proud of. 

Nix OD Sports Scboiarsblps 

To build such a team has not 
been so easy a task. Two years 
ago the students voted down 
the sort of financial assistance 
which would have resulted In 
the so· called athletic 

scholarships. The subject is 
still a delicate matter. " I think 
we should give aid based on 
financial need, a part-time job, 
maybe. " stated Cunningham. 
"Just for the record. Itearly 
every school we play has 
athletic scholarships in 
basketball. 

"T he coac h stated 
emphatically that he was 
against any " special 
privileges" that athletes are 
sometimes assigned. Presently 
he attracts players with not 
much more than the General 
Catalogue. " I tell them about 
the outstanding educational 
opportunity and the great 
area." 

"Yeah, that's pretty much 
why I came here," agreed 
Mark Wilson, a sl im 6'6" 
transfer from a J .C. in San 
Mateo, "and that I could get a 
job." Wilson works the "cage" 
In the gym on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, He, too is a mixture 
of enthusiasm and apathy. " I 
wanted to play basketball and

scholarships. UCR (winner of 
the. All-Cal Tournament) gives 
theIr players the whole ride. 
They can pick up all the super-
players from J .C. 's apd high 
schools. I don 't know if that can 
be done here. I know the 
budget's been cut twice 
already. Maybe they could drop 
some sports but I'm not sure if 
it could be done fairly ." 

Referendum Could Be 
Reversed 

Another way in which this 
funding could be managed is to 
reverse the decision of the 
~adier . referendum: Anyone 
InstIgatIng such an action 
needs a lot of enthusiasm to 
overcome a lot of apathy. Also, 
such a measure would have

major. Now I don't know about 
that history ... " Wilson related 
that some of his fellow team 
members also had mixed or 
conflicting interests . 
"Sometimestheyhave labs and

When pressed on the question 
of funding , Wilson was more

OPERATION SURVIVAL 
UCSD's UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY 

By merely applying the FOURTH BASIC POSTULATE OF SCI · 
EN CE, nearly SO years ago, (the phenomena involved In the func 
tional operation of a SOcial Mechanism are metrical-can be 
precisely measured)- Steinmetz, Scott, Veblen and other fa r· 
seeing Americans accurately predicted a dozen of our malor Eco· 
nomic Milestones, Including the Market Crash of 1929/30, the 
establishment of the FDIC, and other major events, years .head 
of their actual occurrence. 

They also foretold the self·destruction of our present Political 
Price System, as we failed to adjust our modus operandi to con· 
form to our ever·mountlng Technology; our replacement of 
Human Energy by Machine Energy; our ruthless commercial ex· 
ploita tion of our Natural Resources ; our eventual fatal EN· 
VIRONMENTAL POLLUTI ON-our complete lack of over·all 
CONTI NENTAL PLA NN ING-In AN Y DEPARTMENT! 

These Men of Science also had the foresight and wisdom to 
design and blue·printa SCI ENTIFIC GOVE RNAN CE OF FU NC· 
TION, to Intelligently and constructively utilize the 12 BILLION 
HOR SEPOW ER now throbbing through the veins of our American 
Economy.
