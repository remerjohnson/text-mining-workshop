Office, building 250 Matthews 
Campus. If a candidate feels 
that one or more of the ballot 
counters is unacceptable, and can 
state his reasons for this un-
acceptability, he may request that

The assasination of Dr. Martin 
Luther King had a deep and pro-
found effect upon me mbers oUhe 
U.C.S.D. academic community. 
Classes were cancelled Friday 
by order of UC president Hitch 
and a rally was held in the 
plaza that morning. Chancellor 
Galbraith held an official com-
memorative service on the gras-
sy knoll behind the library at 
noon. This was followed later 
in the day by a march into La 
Jolla and a demonstration at 
City Hall in San Diego, where a 
series of recommendations were 
presented. 

Chancellor Galbraith told the 
students that King's dream is far 
from realization and that "the 
time is upon us when all blacks 
and whites must take action to 
translate his dream into reality." 

Dr. William McGill, Chairtnan 
of the Academic Senate at UCSD, 
then spoke, saying, "we grieve 
for our country where such things 
can happen." 

Ed Spriggs, head of the Black 
students' Union told the crowd 
that King's assassination "stands 
as the ultimate indictment of the 
USA, and concludes that period 
in American history when the 
Black oppressed appealed non-
violently to the conscience of 
the White oppressors." 

He continued: "If the white 
community feels real compassion 
for Martin Luther King's death, 
they can prove it in deeds rather 
than with the usual conscience-
solving rhetoric." 

Spriggs claimed that UCSD is 
not exemptfrom racism and made 
several proposals in regard to 
the university. At the conclusion 
of Sprigg's statement the Black 
students present staged a silent 4. students who are currently 

freshmen will vote for Lower 
Division Senator, and students 
who are sophomores, jWliors, 
and seniors will vote for Upper 
Division Senator. U there is any 
question concerning a voters' 
class standing, consult the Pro-
vost's Office of the respective 
College and be prepared to show 
evidence of that status. 

College Polls to Show

a. Candidates for a run-off 
will be chosen from those re-
ceiving the greatest plurality. 

b. No less than one more of 
the number of positions remain-
ing to be filled (when the positions 
to be filled are greater than 1/ 2 
the remaining candidates) shall

maining candidates (Plus one in 
case of an odd number) shall 
be chosen. 

6. The results from the first 
balloting will be posted on the

U. S. President:Selections 
The AS Senate last Monday 

approved a revised election code 
and two election commissioners. 

Heading this year's general 
elections will be freshmen Jim 
McGill and Bruce Borden, ~th 
experienced in high school con-
tests. 

Besides the Election of AS 
officers and senators, UCSD un-
dergrads will also vote in Choice 
'68, a polling of colleges across 
the country for US president, 
Vietnam policy, and the urban 
crisis. Graduate students may 
also vote in Choice '68. 

Revelle students aspiring to 
the three Senators-at-large must 
obtain 60 signatures from mem-
bers of their college, while Muir 
students need only 15. 

For the offices of Upper- and 
Lower-Division Senator, both 

Revelle and Muir candidates will 
need 75 signatures from th stu-
dent body as a whole.

Ann Conklin's Office (Argo Hall), 
are du no later than 5 p.m. on 
April 16, 1968. 

Tile deadline w1l1 be extend d 
only if insufficient number of 
students have filed petitions for 

that office. For example, if no 
one files for vice-president, the 
deadline will be extended for 24 
hour periods until someone does. 

Candidates will also receive 
equal space in the T iton Times 
plus a photograph. The deadline 
for the questionnaires, whichac-
company the petitions, however, 
will not be extended beyond April 
16.

walk-out. 
After the official memorial 

service, students were urged to 
participate in two demonstra-
tions. One was a march through 
La Jolla protesting white racism. 
The other was a demonstration 
at City Hall in San Diego, where 
a list of specifiC proposals and 
recommendations was presented 
to the city officials. 

Earlier in the day students 

heard grad student Barry Sha-
piro speak of what is in store 
for America. He said that the 

Black militants' claim that they 
would abide by the Mosaic law 
of "an eye for an eye" would 

now probably be implemented 
in order to impress upon com-
placent whites the seriousness 
of their intentions.

Students March 
Against Racism 

Several hundred students and 
other members of the academic 
community marched through the 
streets of La Jolla In what was 
termed 'the beginning of a cru-
sade to end white racism in 
America'. 

After the morning commem-
oration service for Martin Luther 
King, the slain civil rights leader, 
students were urged to join in an 
effort to persuade Americans oC 
the urgency Cor a dramatic change 
in attitude concerning race re-
lations. 

In what was quite an orderly 
demonstration, the partiCipants 
walked three abreast in a line 
that stretched for more than 
two blocks. Several carried pla-
cards, while others distributed 

literature to La Jollans. One 
hand-out sheet read: "The King 
is dead • • • killed by a well-
dressed white man who was 
guilty -- how about you?" 

Reaction to the march was var-
ied. One lady handed out flowers 
to the marchers and another 
joined in the demonstration for 
several blocks. When offered lit-
erature one lady refused to ac-
cept it, angrily remarking, 
"There's no racism in La Jolla" • 
Generally the reaction was one 
of mild Interest or indifference. 

The march concluded at 
Scripps Memorial Park. Here 
several speakers spoke to the 
group and told of the need to 
"civilize our neighbors." Spe-
cific plans, they said, for fUture 
action would be announced soon.

Besides providing students , faculty and employes with the best

to pay for schooling thanks to the AS's Coffee Hut. To improve its 
business and its service, the Hut has designed a number of special 
events going on every week for students to enjoy themselves when 
they have the time. Good food that's inexpensive, a Hottenanny every 
Tuesday and Sunday, and live entertainment every Friday and Satur-

Cited As 
Of Racism 

Sometime In March the National Commission to the President 
on Civil Disorders issued a statement to the public that "white 
racism" was the cause of riots in the cities. Many were satisfied 
to hear that a commission of the government came out and agreed 
with the term that Black militants have been using for approximately 
two years to describe the exploited condition of Black people in this 
country. Others, with a broader view of real IiIe situations, felt that 
the commission's report was just a farce because it failed to really 
define and comprehend the true meaning of a racist society. For 
instance, the essential recommendation of this body to cure the country 
of racism was an all out spending effort on the part of the government 
to fund housing projects, poverty and welfare programs and to create 
more jobs for minority groups. However what is obvious to any intel- Editor, The Triton Times!

Our stay at UCSD was one of 
the high lights of our tour. Hav-
ing an individual escort and s tay-
ing in the dorms gave each player 
a true picture of the American 
Student. This experience wlll 
most definitely help create a bet-
ter understanding between the 
United States and the Republic 
of Korea on the "People-to-
People" level. 

The interest shown by the es-
corts was commendable. The 
scheduling and prior planning on 
your part was excellent. I write 
as if you had months to plan. 
We deeply appreciate those extra 
hours that helped make our stay

Editor, Triton Times: 
I am sorry that Cheri Litzen-

berger did not attend the meeting 
at which the Graduate Students of 
the Litel'atu rp. Department pass-
ed a resolution supporting Pro-
fessor Pear::e and others who 
sent the telegram oC support to 
the Japanese student protestors. 
All grad s tudents in the depart-
ment were asked to attend this 
meeting and notified of it through 
the campus mail. 

Mrs. Litzenberger didn't 
choose to attend; that is her 
business. But we must reply to 
her attack which implies that a 
clique secretly got together and 
passed this resolution which they 
then sought to publicize as a un-
animous act. The only truth in 
tbis accusation is that the vote 
taken at the meeting was unani-
mous and nothlng more or less 
was asserted by the Times' ac-
count. 

It is too bad Mrs. Litzenberger 
doesn't read her mall more care-
fully. We would welcome her to 
all meetings along with her opin-
ions. We have not engaged in a 
"public display of dishonesty" as 
she so blatantly charges; the vote 
was " unanimously passed at a 
recent meeting of the Graduate 
Students In Literature", what 
could be clearer!

WA6DOT Radio Joins 
Matthews Campus 

Re::idents of Camp Mathews 
may have noticed a new addi-
tion to their skyline recently--
a 50 foot antenna farm erect-
ed last Sunday by sweating, 
straining, and swearing UCSD 
Amateur Radio Club members 
and several passers-by who 

~ntured too close and were 
sucked into the fray. The tower, 
supporting two high gain, di-
rectional antennas, was secure-
ly fastened to building 250 with 
spit, sticke m, and scotch tape. 
The first station contacted with 
the new antenna was located in 
central Japan and reported that 
the club was putting a ·very 
strong' signal across the Pa-
cific. Stations in various parts 
of the U.S. were then contacted 
and all gave good signal reports 
on 15 meters. When several 
European radio stations were 
·worked' later in the week, 
the effort was judged to be a 
success. Members were sur-
prised to learn that the tower 
was still standing after Mon-
day's earthquake. 

This tower represents the 
latest and best in a series of 
antennas the club has erected. 
Operations started last October 
with a wire strung in among 
the birds and trees, barely 
above the roof. Results were 
mediocre, as was expected. A 
better antenna system was de-
sired, and since the club had 
zero money, members finagled 
and scavenged up whatever 
could be had for free , The tower 

itself, for example, was dis-
covered in some leaves behind 
the Scripps radio station, WWD. 
It was depostied there by the 
waters of Noah's nood and had 
been busily gathering grunge 
ever since. UCSD hams glee-
fully pounced on it and dragged 
it to its present location. It 
is fervently hoped that WWD 
will not want it back. other 
items were obtained by methods 
it is best not to describe In 
detail. Total cost of the new 
structure was less than $10. 

WA6DOT, the club station, 
which is located in the rear 
of building 250, Camp Mathews, 
is on the air most mornings 
and evenings with 180 watts on 
40-and l5-meter single side-
band and 5 watts on 6-meter 
AM phone. More power is hoped 
for next year. 

Individuals and organizations 
with communications needs 
which might be filled by radio 
are invited to contact the club 
for assistance. Aradio link was 
provided for the campus Soaring 
Club during their winter meet 
at Torrey Pines. More requests 
of this nature are hoped for. 
Although club equipment is li-
mited as yet, it is often pos-
sible to improvise as needed. 

New members, regardless of 
past experience, are welcomed. 
Anyone who feels he might be 
interested in learning more a-
bout ham radio should contact.

tional Committee, the Republlcan 
State Central Committee and the

New Sellers Movie Is Wild 
By Dave Sacherman 

Peter Sellers is probably the 
finest comic actor of his time. 
Unfortunately, many of the film s 
in which he has appeared have 
been somewhat shabby endeavors 
which would have been disasters 
without him. His absence even for 
brief moments can be distinctly 
felt and tedium or pointless in-
anity tends to set in. Such is the 
case with Blake Edwards' mad-
cap comedy "The Party." 

Inspired by the kooky party Ed-
wards directed in "Breakfast at 
Titfany's", the film is a satirical 
look at what has become a famed 
Hollywood institution. Sellers in 
a positively brilliant characteri-
zation of Hrundi V. Bakshi, a 
disaster-prone Hindu actor, was 
allowed to improvise much of 
his role and it is s hee r joy to 
watch him in action. 

After inadvertently blowing up 
the fort on a movie set before 
the cameras could roll, Bakshi is 
told he will never work again in 
Hollywood. He is then accidental-
ly invited to the studio head's 
lavish party where from the mo-
ment he squeezes his s trange 
Morgan three-wheeler between a 
Rolls and a Cadillac he leaves 
havoc in his wake. Bakshi is in-
nocent, excessively polite, yet 
totally out of place, and Sellers 

NOTICE 

Because the Committee to E-
lect Robert Kennedy for Presi-
dent was unable to obtain a cur-
rent speech by the New York sen-
ator for this issue, we must post-
pone until next week a rebuttal 
to the Nixon speech, which we

Marcuphily's backtrall, appar-
ently by driving anti-Pearceite

The Bureau is confident that as

tract all of Marcuphlly's 1962

National Archives, it will de-
velop a brand-new hypothesiS. 

Anyway, you got to admit that 
things would be pretty abstruse 
around here if it wasn't for the

Lovely Claudine Longet plays the 
starlet who shares the wild fun 
with Bakshi. 

One of Sellers' finest moments 
of comic splendor is the com-
pletely improvised scene when 
Bakshi deve lops an extreme blad-
der emergency and finds the 
bathrooms continually occupied. 
Seeking relief in the s hrubbe ry 
he trips over the sprinkler sys-
tem and sets it into motion. Re-
turning to the house he is thwart-
ed by the occasion of the young 
s tarlet's singing of a ballad to 
an attentive crowd. Bakshi is 
compelled to s uffer, rocking back

Sadly enough, the film 's first 
half brilliance is not sustained 
and even Sellers' presence can-
not relieve many of the slap-
stick, inane events to follow. 
A group of Ukranian dancers are 
dunked into the pool when Bakshi, 
groping in the dark, activates 
the ret ractabie dance floor. Then 
some college friends arrive with 
a psychedelically painted baby 
elephant and Bakshi indignantly 
demands this sacred beast be 
scrubbed in the foyer lily pond, 
engulfing the entire party in soap. 

As a whole, "The Party" is an 
extremely enter talnlngaffair, but 
it is rather unfortunate that Se 1-
lers' talent is the only positive 
attribute holding it intact. 

AS Presidency Now 
A Three-Way Race 

With the announcement of Sen-
ator Tom Shepard for th e AS 
presidency yesterday, the cruef 
office of student government be-
came a three-way race between 
two sophomores and a junior. 

John Mishler, RA or Atlantis 
and a Revelle Junior, and Mich-
ael BrQwn, a Revelle Sophomore, 
will be In the running against 
Shepard, who plans to transfer to 
Muir College next year. The sig-
nificance of this year's race, in 
other words , is thatthe presiden-
cy could go to a non-Revelle stu-
dent. 

With the election s till twelve 
days away, th e three candidates 
have yet to publish their plat-
forms, although posters and 
painted dorm windows are al-
ready in full production. Of course 
petitions are still available for all 
AS offices. 

In his own way, each candidate 
is active In and familiar with 
student government. 

Tom Shepard is now an AS Sen-
ator-at-Large from Revelle. He 

is chairman of the Student Center 
Committee and originator of the 
"Shepard Questionnaire," which 
appears regularly in the Triton 
Times. 

John Mishler, as a resident 
assistant, has been involved in 
student ~dministratlon relations. 
He helped formulate a plan f'lr 
Revelle College government and 
has attended AS Senate meetings 
in the past. 

Michael Brown of Argo Hall is 
perhaps the most outspoken of 
the three candidates. He has 
been acti ve in the Students of the 
Independent Left and also ran for 
the presidency (but bowed out be-
fore the election) last year. 

In the April elections more than 
2000 undergraduates will choose 
their AS officers. In a special 
issue of the Triton Times, plat-
forms and photographs of all can-
didates will be printed. Meantime 
tbe three AS presidential hopefuls 
must make known their individual 
programs for the future of AS 
student government.

v.P. Oswald' 
Cant Id from p. 1 

A nativ{; of Minneapolis, Os-
wald received his early education 
in La Grange, Illinois, and his 
B.A. from DePauw University in 
Greencastle, Indiana. At DePauw 
be was a member of Phi Beta 
Kappa, captain of the football 
team, and also lettered in basket-
ball and track. He was a graduate 
student on UC's Berkeley and 
Davis campuses from 1938 to 
1942, earning his Ph.D. in plant 
pathology. 

After service in the Navy dur-
ing World War II, Oswald re-
turned to Davis as assistant pro-
fessor of plant pathology. He 
became a full professor In 1957, 
and in the same year became ad-
ministrative assistant to Clark 
Kerr, then Chancellor of the 
Berkeley campus. In 1958, when 
Kerr became UC President, Os-
wald was named Academic As-
sistant to the President. In 1959 
he became Assistant Vice Presi-
dent, in 1961 Vice President and 
Executive Assistant, and in 1962 
Vice President for AdmInistra-
tion.

Sports Announcements 
In the final game of the Cham-

pionship Tournament, the But-
Fakes beat the Purple Gophers 
40-39. The But-Fakes led at the 
end of the first quarter, 14-4, 
and held this 10 poInt lead until 
the last 5 minutes of the game 
when the Purple Gophers made 
their now famous last quarter 
surge which fell short. 

Joe Cox's drives around Chris-
tinaz in the first quarter, Chris 
Sundstrom's 4 quarters of clutch 
play, Rob McCormick's and Al 
Hyatt 's rebounding, and Mike 
Ott's 2 last-minute baskets all 
contributed to the team victory. 

Mark Waxman played a great 
defensive game and held Borth 
to 4 poInts. With Joe Cox sitting 
out most of the second half with 
4 fouls, Tom Biglione played 
fine clutch basketball. 

Actually the story of the game 
was told at the free throw line. 
The Gophers hit 13 for 36 (Chris-
tinaz was 4 for 14) while the But-
Fakes were 8 for 17 (8 for 10 In 
the second half). 

Tom Bird played well for the 
Gophers, scoring 11 and playing 
a fine defensive game.

TENNIS 
This f)ekend was the time 

for upset as the UCSD tennis 
squad co qupred both opponents 
they pia yed. 

On Saturday, the Tritons beat 
the touring University of Color-
ado team in a tough match. The 
Color-adoans had had a very suc-
cessful tour of the Far West 
before coming here. and UCSD 
finished them 5-4. 

On Monday, the team pulled 
off an upset win over a strong 
Cal Western squad 51/2 to 31/2. 
Though the match was called 

off because of darkness, the 5 
points earned by the Tritons 
meant they had already won the 
match. 

With the win over the Western-
ers, the Tritons can lay claim 
to the unofficial City champion-
ship, because they have beaten 
all the local schools. 

The coming week will show if 
the team can wIn outside the 
city, as they take on UC Santa 
Barbara and Cal State Fuller-
ton in two very tough matches. 

SOCCER 
The UCSD intercollegiate soc-

cer team is now holding practice 
sessions twice a week in prepara-
tion for their initial season in the 
fall. This is not the club team 
that has been organized for the 
past few years, but is the under-
graduate intercollegiate squad 
that will represent UCSD in the 
newly formed soccer league in 
southern California. This league 
includes teams from UC River-
side, Biola, San Diego state, 
Long Beach State, and UC Irvine. 
Those interested should contact 
Dr. Sarolli for more information.

Coach Walt Hackett is anxious-

ly antiCipating the 29th of April, 
because on that day, he will be 
able to see what kind of football 
talent he has on this campus. 

Monday, April 29th, is the 
first day of Spring training, and 
equipment will be issued, and 
introductions given. The time will 
be around 4:30 in the PM. so

out something.

be held here at home, Saturday, 
the 28th of September, against 
La Verne. The remainder of the 
season will see games against

BASEBAll 
Last Saturday afternoon saw 

the Tritons split adouble-headp.r 
with UC Riverside. 

The first game was won by the 
UCSD squad by a score of 2-1 
only by going into ext ra Innings. 
Coach Kieth Stowe's men couldn't 
take the second game, however, 
losing to the Highlanders 5-0. 

The second game was called 
short, in fact, because of the 
length of the fir st. Robb Field, 
UC8D's home park, doesn't have 

the facilities for night games. 
On Tuesday, the Tritons were 

up against a strong team from 
Cal Western, and were dropped 
4-2. 

Atter the Riverside win, and 
two previous wins over the San 
Diego State JV, the Triton's re-
cord stands at 4-4, which is pretty 
fair for a first year team. The 
players have a bye this week and 

. go again the 19th of April.
