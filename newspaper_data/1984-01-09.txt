The AS Council's programs and decisions have created ClJnt rove rsy .md haw 
been .chaUenged by many diverse groups on campus. Now one campus 
orgamzatlon, MEChA, has dlstnbuted a statement to adl11Inistrative offices 
throughout Ihe campus 10 reveal what MEChA considers to be a consistent and 
directed assault againsl their organizalion, ' 

The MEChA statement: 
"President Lee, Commissioner of Communications Pickwell . Marc Geiger 

and the Tupperwa,re crol1les have coheSively attempted to segregale , eliminate 
and IIlsult the Chlcano/ Mexiano population at UCSD, 

"The AS under the guise of effective sludent representation has demonstrated 
elements of racism , sexism and elitism, We find these elements not only 

dama~mg to [he UCSD communtty but unacceptable behavior by the student 
councIl. TheIr antl -Chlcano/~exlcano campaign began when Geiger flatly 
refused .to compromIse on mergll1g the MEChACinco de Mayo celebration with 
d TGI F 111 Spnng of '83, The merger of the two events has never been an issue 
between the two respective orgamutions, [,T hiS Cultural TGIF has been a UCSD 
tradition since 1978, J 

"Geiger made his deCIsion on the premise Ihat the mainstreiltll TGIF regulars 

would not appreciate the merger or MEChA's presence, The AS upheld his 
deClston and made a token refreshment aUocation, 

"Second,ly, there was the funding of the taliforma Review, The AS argument of 
Freedom of the Press was not valid, MEChA was nOI opposed 10 Ihe presence of 
the ReVIew on campus, Rather. we opposed student monies supp<>rnng a 
newspaper Ihat promotes derogatory stereotypes under the guise of 
conservatism, Its slanderous content and raCIal slurs are nOl alternative views, 

~me members of the counCIl strongly supported ItS funding on the grounds of 
the nght, LO publish the nght": raCist, elitist and sexist ideology a~an altemalive 

vle.w: We c~n assume from this , that the), ascribe to such opinions, 
Pickwell s attempl at combInmg all the media into one penodicalls one step 

rloser to elil11in,lling them, 
, "The AS decision to repeal the Coors boycott displays their obvious 
Insensltlvtty to ThIrd World students, women and the working class .... Coors 
has a .Ionghlstory of dlscnmmatlon agall1s1 ChlCanos/ Mexicanos, In light of 
Coors antl-Chlcano/ Mexlcano hIStory the AS did everything in its power 
Including breaking its own by-laws, to repeal the boycott, ' 

"We find this irresponsible Jbuse of the council's power and not student 
represent.1lion , It is instead. a cdlculJted offensive by the male Anglo 
TuppeIWdfe cromes to destroy the few mroads our people have made IntO this 
Inslltution , MEChA IS baSIng ItS allegations on some AS Illembers' Jetions, and 
Ihe f.lct that some members are alTillJted to certain rraternities that rewards its 
members for 'Sc.tting the frijoles out of a MexicaniLO.' This condoning 01 violent 
JCIS based on racial lines IS not 10 be t.1ken lightly, ' 

"MEChA IS condemning the AS (or promoting il racisl , elilisl .:nu sexist 
campus envmll1mem th at IS exclusivel)' calering to male Anglos, Furthermore, 
ME hA is prep,lr~ LO implement Jppropnate actions If the AS continues to 
undennll1e ~ Chic,ltlo/ Mexlcano existence at UCSD " 

A spokesperson for MEChA said, "We are hopll1g the statemcnt will help the 
Ml11lll1strJlIon and the AS Council reJlize IhJl Jllhough MEChA m.ly not be 
Visually present ,Ill the lime, il is the suppOrt group of the Mexic.lI1S and 
Chicanos, And >econdarily we hope LO educate the general UCSD student 
public on Ihe issues, Our purpose IS nOl to antagomze the CouncIl but ILl point 
OUI thJt deCISions cannot be made on ,\11 economic baSIS alone; the nJture of the 
progr.lm mU'it he t.lkcn intn .ICCOunt "

Editorial 

Your last chance to make a 
difference: fill out a sUlVey 

While the 1600 or so responses to the Unive rsity 
Center survey is unprecedented at UCSD, the ten 
percent of the student body that it represents is still 
not an effective voice of students. Student Center 
Director and University Center Planning Facilitator 
Tom Tucker says that while the survey will not be a 
mandate, he assures that its impact will be 
"substantial" in planning the University Center. For 
this reason The Guardian asks anyone who has not 
completed the surve.y to do so this week. The survey, 
being the only representa tion of the student voice, 
will be competing with the collec tive voice of the 
administration, faculty, and alumni , which represents 
a formidable obstacle to student wishes in the actual 
planning of the new center. 

But beyond the basic need for student input on 
this survey is the chance for students to request the 
type of services that they would like at the new 
center. With this in mind , The Guardian urges 
students to comple te the survey with an emphasis 
toward student-run and student-oriented senrices. It 
is our belief that rather than having outside vendors 
coming on campus and turning a profit off of 
students, the University Center should ideally have 
low- or non-profit services organized a nd run by 
students for students. While it is easy to envision a 
bureaucratic nightmare associated with the thought of 

students running anything, we hope that with proper 
supervision and financial responsibility they would 
be forced to be efficient operations. 

Our own co-op system is an example of how 
student-run services can, over time and with a few 
mistakes, become viable and more beneficial to 
students than competing profit-oriented businesses. 
The General Store, Groundworks bookstore . the Food 
Co-op. AS Vinyl, Che Cafe and similar pro-student 
organizations deserve your support in this sunrey. 
Student-oriented services like the University Events 
Office and the Crafts Center and AS services like 
lecture notes and soft resenres should receive support 
as well . This is also an excellent chance for students 
"to show their support of a multi-purpose room that 
would house events from concerts and parties to 
dances and speeches, a room sorely needed on 
campus. 

However, the first step to take is to fill Out a sunrey 
and let your voice be heard . The more interest shown 
by the students, the more seriously planners wil! 
weigh the results of the survey. Also take time to 
voice your support of student-run/anti-profit services 
in the written comment section . It is in your best 
interest not to encourage outside vendors to come on 
campus and derive profits from the student body. 

Surveys are available aU week at EDNA.

Bennan directs riew 
Humanities Institute 
By JAMES RALPH PAPP 

UCSD Extension is beginning a 
progr.1m this January 10 alTect the quality 
of the education future UCSD 
undergmduates from San Diego County 
receive . The new Humanities Institute 
will reeducate 50 San Diego high school 
teachers in the major works of 
phIlosophy. history and Iiter.1ture in a 
five-week Intensive course over the 
summer and at continuing intervals 
throughout the year, 

Over the summer the National 
Endowment for the Humanities .1warded 
a grant of more than $134.000 to 
support the Institute for its firSt 18 
months: from preparation m January to 
the gradu.1tion of ItS first class twO 
summers later. 

Professor Ronald Berman of the 
-Litemture Department initiated the plans 

for the Institute, and he will be Its IIrst 
director. The inspiration came from one 
of Berman's students asking the 
unguarded queStion of whether Julius 
Caesar liked the way Shakespeare 
ponmyed him. which San Diego's 
newspapers made good sport of. 

However, the Los Angeles Times felt it 
necessary to add. 'The long-dead Julius 
Caesar had no response ." That makes it 
evident that the failure in educanon in 
the humanities is as little confined to 
gener.1tions as it is to individuals. 

The faculty will include Professors 
David Luft of the HiStory Department, 
Jonathan Saville of the Ora'ma 
Department and Avrum Stroll of the 
Philosophy Department. There will also 
be lectures by nationally and currently 
prominent scholars. The lectures will be 
open to anyone who wants to attend . 

The hope is that the teachers will go 
back to their high schools and tum out 
students stronger in the hum.1nities 
through their own classes and changes 
in the curriculum. The second hope is 
that the Endowment will see fit . from 
the success. to continue the funding. If 
these hopes are confirmed. as early as 
two years from now UCSD will be 
experiencing a freshman class with a 
better foundation in the humanistic 
studies.

II is not the Perspectives section's policy to withhold infonnation 
from its readers, however dubious (the information, that is, not the ~ 
readers). It has come to our attention that an organization called, 
acronymlcally (we think not entirely by chance), SEA, is offering sail-
powered, class-i nfested journeys for university credit. The Sea Education 
Association's voyage takes place on the RN (recreational vehicle?) Westward, which is 
pictured at right in front of an iceberg. The presence of the iceberg is somewhat 
perplexing, since according to our letter from SEA the Westward sails from Woods 
Hole , Massachusetts, to the Caribbean and the argasso Sea. On the other hand, the 
picture may have been taken over this last Christmas. 

After a six-week course of study on shore, the Westward takes students on a six-week 
voyage to ewfoundland and lova cOli a in the summer; and in the winter to the Gulf 
of Mexico and the Greater Antilles or, on the economy pdckage, to the Lesser AnuUes. 
The subjects covered, in the classroom and in practice, are biology, geology, chemistry, 
physics, ndvigation, naval architecture (houseboats?), shipbutlding, marine engineering 
systems, ship management and maritime heritage, including history, politics, literature 
and economics. It IS perhaps JUSt as well that shuffieboard and trapshooting are not 
offered .

behind me and he would raise hiS hand He would gct Ihc A I always .lvolded the 
limelight. I never took those open twenty-footers from lelr of Ihe key. I passed off. 
Well , those days have come to an end . After 17 months of sh.uing the credit for Ihis 
column with Mike Greenberg, the glory is fin.lliy ,111 mine. The Llndem has been 
dissolved . Mr. Greenberg IS not leaving us completely, howeve r. He Will cover UCSD 
men's basketball , and very masterfully I'm sure. He IS one of thc best sportswriters San 
Diego has 10 offer. But Ihe rewards for Running Thoughts will not have to be shared , I 
want to hold the Pulilzer over my head with both hands. I will miss those heated 
arguments in the Guardiall newsroom. We often found ourselves .11 odds on what to 
write about. Mike would say, "Did you see wh;lt the Administration did now? ... Let's rip 
'em!" And I would say, "No Mike, water polo lost again ... let's rip them ." We usually 
compromised by ripping both . At least my fellow editors will be spared. So will my 
ulcer. I'm so excited. 
NOT TO BE BEUEVED DEPT. And the results are finally in .... The Raiders and the 
Redskins march into Super Bowl XVIII. They both earned it. The Skins pounded their 
way through a brilliant 14-2 season with both losses coming by a mere point. The 
Raiders Hekyll-Jekylled their way to the Super Bowl by laying down for a while against 
their opponents and then striking qUickly to surge ahead and win. The Redskins are 
the media favorite . With the Hogs. the Smurfs and the Fun Bunch, the Skins are Ihe 
team to be hyped . They are also the favorite . The Darth Vader Raiders are a group of 
individuals playing with reckless abandon . The Redskins are just a group playing 
together. Remembering guys like Ron McDole, onny Jurgensen , Billy Kilmer and 
Charley Taylor, I've always been a Redskin fan. But it's a shame that they received a 
Super Bowl berth by beating San Francisco on twO controversial penalties. If you 
watched the game and said as the offIcials did that 4ger cornero.lck Eric Wright 
interfered wuh receiver Art Monk on a third down play during the winning drive , I'll 
laugh in your face . When Ronnie Loti chucked a Redskin receiver within the five yard 
zone following the "rape play" and another yellow flag came down. I realized the 
Redskins were desllned Wh,lI a shame to see it dedded that wav, The Raiders hJd no 
problem handling the Chuck Knox-led ea hawks In Ihe Cohseurri. Flstfights set the 
carl)' tempo, brute slrength se ttled it at the half and pnde and pOise closed it out. The 
Raidcrs' playoff performance against e.lttle yesterday <lI1d Pin burgh .1 week earlier 
earned Ihem the righl to play in the Gr.lndadd y. The SkinS have outshmed their 
opponents all season Igng .lIld belong there also. The true NFL ch.lmplOn will emerge

WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Eve n the world 01 goll has not escaped the fi me s boom era 
Caddie h,lVe become a dying breed as more and morc golfers now prefer to lug their 
o n clubs up, down and .I round golf course hills. For IJn ungdon , .I member of the 
UC D golf team, the age of cdddyiess golf couldn'l have come soon enough. L.lIlgdon

Courses 0/ Inter-Disciplinary 
Interest Offered by Philosophy 

Winter 1984 
Philosophy 117 • hoWe.s irt Sciertti/ic MethodoloSJI 
MWF - 2;00 • 2;50 - HL 1205 - Zeno Swijtink 
(Crs. code 4(02) 
This is a philosophy of science class for students interested in the behavioral 
sciences, the social sciences, or meditine. These sCiences are interested in the 
causes of behavior, causal networks, or the causal power or efficacy of treatments. 
We will compare what philosophers have wntten about causes with the methods 
used in these sciences to establish causal claims. 

Philosophy 122 - Bio·Medical Ethics 
TTh - 10;00 • 11;20 - HL 1438 - Barbara Winters 
(Crs. Code 3695) 
This course will examine ethical issues that anse in the practice of medicine and 
medical research, wil h a special focus on attempting to develop justifiable moral 
principles that can help resolve such disputes. After a short general introduction to 
Ihe mdlor ethical theories, particular issues will be explored, such as: the concept 
of health, the physician·patient relationship, patients' rights and physicians' 
responSibilities, informed consent, confidenliality of medical records, eu thanasia 
and the prolongation of life. allocation of scarce medical resources, medical 
expenmentahon . .tvledical case·studies will be examined. The intended outcome of 
the course IS that students will be able to use the moral tools presented to reason 
eHectively on their own about the ethical problems in medicine. 

Philosophy 152 - Philosophy and Literature 
TTh - 1;00·2:20 - BB 2135 - Frederick Olafson 
(Crs. Code 4605) 
This course will deal with the role of moral understanding in imaginalive literature · 
more specifically in the modern novel. Its premise is that in representing human 
beings in their relationships to one another the novel can hardly avoid at least 
implicit judgments on the moral character of such persons and their actions. In 
some of the very best modern novels the author has chosen, quite deliberately, to 
concentrat e on this moral element in the life of his characters. Perhaps the 
preeminent novelist 01 this kind is Henry James; and I have therefore chosen two 
01 his novels, The Wings of t he DOlle, and The Golden Bowl, as t he main reading 
for this course. The course will begin with a quasi· philosophical treatment of the 
theme of morality in its broad application to society and to literature: Modern 
Dogma and the Rhetoric 0/ Assent by Wayne Booth. The written work of the 
course will probably consist of two short papers in addition to the linal 
examination. 

174 - Philosophical Psychology 
MWF - 1;00·1 ;50 - USB 3028 - James Klagge 
(Crs. Code (607) 
ThiS course Will be concerned with vanous views ont he nature 01 t he mind. We will 
begin by diSCUSSing claims by the psychological theorieS 01 psychoanalysis and 
behaViorism. Then we will focus on some contemporary philosophical theories 
such as type 'ldentlly, functionalism, loken·idemity, and dual·aspect. We will 
conclude With a diSCUSSion of the place of subjeclivity In theOries 01 the mind.
