AJex Kushner said. "It was 
extremely smooth and there were 
no major problems." 

Los Angeles rap group the 
Pharcyde kicked off the concert at 
7:30 p.m., with srudents continu-
ing to fill the venue as the group 

began their performance. While 
many srudents remained in the 
stands, those who stood near the 
stage covered nearly hal f of the 
arena floor, exhibiting an enthusi-
astic and energetic participation 
with the group. 

Some srudents, however, did 
not appreciate the lyrical content 
of the Pharcyde's songs. 

"1 didn't like what the songs 
were about because it doesn't send 
out the right message," said 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more Jennifer Figueroa, in refer-
ence to the group's frequent men-
tions of marijuana . 

Shortly after the Pharcyde's 
performance, pop-punk band 
Midtown was prepared and ready 
to begin their set. As the band 
began to play, many students 
rushed down to the arena floor. 

"Y loved tonight," said 
Midtown drummer Rob Hiu. 
"Everything was great. It's very 
good to know that college kids are 
open-minded and able to go crazy

When Robert C. Dynes offi-
cially took office as the 
University of California's new 
president on Oct. 2, he faced a 
multitude of difficult questions, 
some of which he already began 
to address in initial conferences 
with UC officials and the 
media, with more to come 
throughout his inaugural tour 
of the U ystem in coming 
month . 

Facing II dire budget sinta-
tion, Dyne has made it clear 
that he will fight against esti-
mated 20 percent cuts from the 
tate legislantre, although he 

ha not yet outlined a plan for 
dealing with the budget. 

" I am not willing to ac cpt 
the 20 percent budget cut at tillS 
point," Dync aid. "I\.Ithough 
we 've been a ked to go through 
that e crci e, a 20 percent bud-
get Cllt is a deva tating budget 
ut for the Universiry of 
allfornia . I ;In't imagine 

reducing the budgets by that 
am lint." 

Dynes added that thi is 

equivalent to reducing the sys-
tem by two or three campu es, 
which was "unthinkable." 

"I won't accept that and I will 
make as per uasive arguments as 
I can that the University ha 
already taken such difficul t cuts 
and that it's inappropriate for u 

to take any 
more," he

Elderly studies promoted 
ues given $12 million for geriatric chairs 

By CHRISTINE PAl 
Staff Writer 

With the intent of promoting 
the study of aging and healthcare 
for the elderly, the Un iversi ty of 
California is expected to receive 
$12 million in state and private 
funds to provide for six new chairs 
in geriatrics medicine. The Davis, 
Irvine, San Diego, Los Angeles 
and San Francisco medical pro-
grams, as well as the Berkeley 
campus, will be receiving funds. 

While UC campuses in San 
Francisco and Irvine will each 
receive $2 million from state 
funds, UCSD received a private 
contribution of $2 million from 
the Larry L. Hillblom 
Foundation, a nonprofit organiza-
tion that promotes medical stud-
ies at the University of California. 

"We need to find out why some 
people age well, while others don't 
and what can be done to make peo-
ple live longer and healthier with 
old age," said Dilip Jeste, interim 
director of UCSD 's Stein Institute 
for Research on Aging. "With the 
decoding of the genome, we will 
learn more and more about differ-
ent diseases that kill or disable old 
people so that we can develop 
treatments or preventive strategies 
against those illnesses." 

A press release from the UC 
Office of the President dated Sept. 
30 stated that the primary aims of 
the geriatrics initiative are to 
recruit and maintain new UC fac-
ulty clinicians who have the skill 
to care for the elderly, promote 
"active roles" as educators and 

mentors for the teaching of UC 
medical students and residents, 
and to ensure "best practices" in 
geriatrics education throughout 
all campuses of the University of 
California. 

Jeste , who specializes in geri-
atric psychiatry at the UCSD 
School of Medicine, and who is 
the Estelle and Edgar Levi Chair 
in Aging, said that the $2 million 
in funds will arrive shortly. 

The $2 million will be distrib-
uted mostly within the medical 
programs at UCSD School of 
Medicine, but undergraduate pro-
grams will benefit from the contri -
bution as well. 

"My understanding is that the 
endowment is intended to support 
the geriatric medicine faculty, 
given the acute shortage in the 
field," Jeste said. "However, the 
undergraduate program will bene-
fit indirectly because of greater 
opportunities for undergraduates 
to participate in clinical or 
research projects in geriatrics." 

The current budget cuts to the 
University of California are unlike-
ly to cause any disparity in the 
intended funds for the program. 

"These days, one has to worry 
about any possible budget cuts," 
Jeste said . "However, I do not 
expect that the $2 million endow-
ment to UCSD for the Hillblom 
chair will be altered. We must 
realize that this endowment won't 
solve all the problems in geri-
atrics, and the concern is that 
other support needed to help the 
program grow may not be there 
unless we make it a priority area." 

www.ucsdguardlan.org 

Advances in geriatrics studies are 
crucial to the well-being of future 
senior citizens, according toJeste. 

"There is critical need for 
training and research in geriatrics, 
and medicine in the future will be 
increasingly geriatric," Jeste said . 
"In 1900, there were 3 million 
Americans over the age of 65 and 
today that number is 35 million. 
In just 30 more years, it will dou -
ble to nearly 70 million." 

The newly developed chairs 
will be a part of the UC Academic 
Geriatric Resource Program, 
which was first authorized by the 
California legislature in 1984 as a 
step to better shape new initiatives 
in the study of aging. 

In September 2000, Gov. Gray 
Davis signed legislation for the 
Geriatric Medical Education 
Training Act, which first initiated 
the drive to develop further stud-
ies in geriatrics for UC students 
and faculty. That same year, cam-
puses in San Francisco and Irvine 
received $4 million to jumpstart 
the program. 

Former UC President Richard 
C. Atkinson encouraged other cam-
puses to initiate studies in geriatrics. 
This year UCSD and UCLA will 
be receiving private funds. 

"This is an unprecedented ini-
tiative in academic medical educa-
tion," Atkinson said. "We appreci-
ate the states recognition of the 
university's role in training future 
physicians to meet the needs of 
the people of this state, and we are 
very grateful to the two founda-
tions that made generous contri-
butions to support this effort."

Advisory committee 
selects architects 
Price, Student Center 

expansion moving along 
By MARNmE FEDERIS

selected two architectural firms 
over the summer, one for the

another for the 

" 

Design for Price Center's expansion 
and Public, a local fi rm in San 
Diego that had already designed 
Phase I of Student Center expan-
sion project, to complete Phase II. 

In continuing the planning and 
design tJhase for the expansions of 
Price Center and Student Center, 
the BAC must deal with issues of 

Phase II expansion 
of Student Center. 
With these firms 
selected, the com-
mittee is heading 
into the program-
ming phase where 
committee mem-
bers gather ideas 
and then present 
them to the 
designers. In turn, 
the designers will 
take the ideas and 
concepts to crea te 
a drawn-out plan. 

In the beginning of 
the summer, there 

space allocation, 
designing a finan-
cial model and 
deciding on some 
conceptual designs. 
The committee 
met throughout the 
summer after the 
selection process to 
discuss ideas on 
certain aspects of 
the project. 

"Things are 

were not too many 
students [at the 

meetings] and mare 
staff and faculty , 

which is not how it 
should be ." 

"We're continu-
ing on working 
with program and

ing what goes 
where - in te rms 
of food service, 
retail, conference 
room - and what 
would be in Price 

going smoothly," 
BAC A.S. repre-
sentative Max 
Harrington said.

"We've been moving speedily and 
on schedule." 

The BAC received over 30 pro-
posals from renowned architectural 
firms before making its choice. A 
selection committee narrowed the 
number to a pool of five. The 
selected five then gave a presenta-
tion to the committee about their 
ideas for the project. In the end, the 
selection committee chose Cannon 

Center versus what would be in 
Student Center," BAC co-Chair 
Carmen Vasquez said. 

The referendum, which called 
for a $39-per-quarter student fee in 
addition to existing fees for the 
renovation and expansion of Price

2003 recall guide 

Vote "no" on recall: Election turned circus no longer 
maintains original meaning of democratic process 

V oters wdl be a ked whether Gov. Gray Davis should be recalled when 
they enter their respective 
polllllg places on OCt. 7, and 
chances are mey WIll have an 
answer to that question. The 
question as to why a governor 
should be recalled in the first 
place IS what may be unclear to a 
number of Californians, as the 
recall's purpose ha been distort-
ed by recall organizers, several of 
the candIdates contending for 
DaVIS' Job and other hearsay vot-
ers altke. 

The motivation for me recall, 
a~ It IS conveyed to Caltfornians 
and now the hordes of onlookers 
worldWIde, is that DaVIS is at 
fault for a number of problems 
that have directly and effectively 
caused the $3 bilhon deficit in 

Propositions 

PROP~ 53 

the 2003 -04 general budget. 
Various rea ons for the deficit 
Include the tech bubble burst 
and sluggish economy, translat-
Ing IntO much lower state rev-
enues from taxes on capItal 
gains, corponte income, indI-
vidual Incom: and retail sales; 
the deregLlation of the 
Californl3 energy market, which 
led to price gouging by compa-
nies and state spending to save 
con umers; and increa ed spend-
ing on public programs. 

The governor has also been 
charged with not passing a state 
budget by the June 30 consOtu-
nonal deadline. 

DavIs ' decisions regardIng 
the above is ues have not often 
won public applause, but the e 
decIsions have been made WIth -
Out legal malfeasance or inten-

tional wrongdoing. The once-
booming economy of the 1990s 
has rescinded across me nation 
in every sute, not just California 
(the deficit per capita at the fed-
eral level I seven times the size 
of California's) . Californians 
have every nght to be angry 
about the economic landscape, 
but perhaps just as much (or 
even more) should be made of 
me nation's outlook and federal 
lawmakers' policy decisions . 
Unemployment rates, budget 
deficits and consumer confi-
dence have all taken drastic hits 
across the United tatcs at levels 
on par with CalifornIa's strug-
gles. 

nergy deregulation in the 
state was b rn by former Gov. 
Pete Wilson and Davis has con-
ceded that he was slow to aCI un 

the horrific consequences. It 
takes two-thirds of each legisla-
tive house in Sacramento to pass 
the budget, so why isn't the 
leadership of the Sena te and 
Assembly to blame a well for 
not passing the budget punctu-
ally? 

The recall process was a pro-
gressive move to guard against 
bribery, coercion, fraud and 
secret financing of campaign in 
1911 to clear the state capitol of 
railroad barons' grip on public 
policy through corruption . There 
has been much argument that 
Davis is guilty of all of the above 
as well, but comparatively, the 
current governor is no guiltier 
than any poliucian in 
Sacramento. There have been no 
allegations against DaVIS for acru-
ally operating illicidy while in 

power to thIS constitutional provision. PROP. 54 

action, and to support a recall 
where the official in question has 
not commined any prosec utable 
crime is an abuse of dle recall 
amendment. 

Special intcrests have occu-
pied the capitol in the fifth largest 
economy of the world becau e 
these interested partie know 
what kind of implications publiC 
policy has on the resources of 
California's diverse and abundant 
population, va t land-area, and 
potential for profit. 

Special intere tS will never 
disappear frolll politics in 
California or the United Statcs 
for that maner, and have played 
a vital part in the finanCing and 
promotion of thi recall in the 
fir t place.

Vote "no" on Proposition 53, which 
seeks to earmark 3 percell[ of the state 
budget toward infrastructure develop-
ment. Although Caltfornia's decaytng 
Infra tructure does need upkeep, forcing 
the legIslature to spend almost $3 bllhon 
a year IS not the way to do il. 

If Infrastructure needs more money, 
the legIslature can go ahead and fund 
IIlfraHructure. Locking 3 percent of the 
budget only makes It more dIfficult to 
adapt to changes III the future when the 
state's infrastructure may more or less 
requIre 3 percent of the budget.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has become

shift is a good move for the party, helping 

to more accurately portray dle majority 
views of most Republicans than the more 
conservative State Sen. Tom McClintock. 

Behind the shiny image, however, 
Schwarzenegger may not prove to be the 
IIlstant remcdy so many CalIforn Ian

Peter Camejo 
Green 

Having borne all but constant com-
parisons to 2000 presidential candidate 
Ralph ader, Green Parry candidate 
Peter Camejo has been under nearly con-
stant pressure from his party - as well as 
Democrats - to drop out of the recall 
race, and the GUlJrdian applauds him for 
steadfastly refusing. 

Camejo is taking advantage of a good 
opportunity to promote dle platform and 
perspectives of the Green Party. If the 
party is ever to win a major election, back-
ing out of races to promote me Democratic 
ticket is definitely not me solution. 

Camejo has proven to be passiona te 
and intelligent during his campaign, 

holding his own in debates and bringing 
true credibility to me Green platform. 
His presence has certainly hel ped to com-
bat the stereotypes regarding his party, 
fighting me long- tanding labels of hippy 
and tree-hugger. 

The Green Party could not have asked 
for a better representative. Considering 
that Camejo's ratings have perpetually 
been within the margin of error of nearly 
every poll, a vote for him is unlikely to 
change the outcome of me Arnold vs. 
Cruz battle. 

But for all that he's done to prove his 
integrity and validate his party, Camejo's 
sometimes extreme left-wing views will 
always keep him on the fringe and almosl 
certainly prevent him from being a key 
contender.

MONDAY. OCTOBER 6, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Labs under further scrutiny 
Trouble hits third of DC nat'llabs 

.,.UN MA 
Staff Writer 

Amidst allegations of misman-
agement and fiscal errors at two of 
its three national laboratories dat-
ing back three years, the University 
of California is under scrutiny once 
again for financial bookJceeping 
irreguJarities at its third laboratory, 
Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. 

William Wasson, the chief 
financial officer at Lawrence 
Berkeley Natiorul Laboratory, was 
placed on administra tive leave after 
external auditors discovered the 
errors last month. 

"They're not alleging fraud or 
criminal misconduct or missing 
money," lab spokesperson Reid 
Edwards said in an interview with 
the San Francisco Chronic/to "The 
books JUSt weren't clear enough or 
concise enough." 

If the allegations are true, 
Wasson could be suspended or 
even dismissed from his position at 
the laboratory. 

This incident follows similar 
but more severe allegations at Los 
Alamos National Laboratory in 
November 2002 and at Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory in 
early 2000. 

In each of the other two cases, 
the University of California 
awarded $1 million settlements to 

the whistle blowers who filed law-
suits after they brought the issue 
of questionable accounting prac-
tices to the attention of manage-
ment. 

They were then dismissed from 
their laboratory positions, thus 
hinting at the idea of a cover-up. 

The University of California 
settled in an attempt to move past 
the incidents. 

"It was in the best interest of 
everyone involved to settle," said 
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory 
spokesperson Lynda Seaver. "Both 
parties wanted to move forward ." 

In the wake of the Los Alamos 
and Lawrence Livermore prob-
lems, the University of California 
tried to improve management of 
its national labs with a series of 
personnel changes including the 
resignation of the director and 
principle deputy director at Los 
Alamos and the appointment of 
UC senior executives as interim 
administrators for laboratory 
operations. 

"We've taleen corrective actions 
to solve the problems and to ensure 
that these types of mismanagement 
practices do not happen again," 
Seaver said. 

Major accounting firms have 
also been contracted to review 
financi al and business operations. 
These firms include Ernst & Young 
and Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 

which incidentally brought the 
recent financial matters at 
Lawrence Berkeley to light. 

"We have talren these sweeping 
and dramatic steps because of the 
pride we at the University of 
California feel for our long and 
productive association with Los 
Alamos [and other labs)," said UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson in a 
press release. "I intend to do every-
thing I can to address the issues 
that have been raised and to restore 
the confidence we have enjoyed for 
much of our 60-year association 
with the laboratories." 

Despite promises of better busi-
ness practices by the UC system 
back in January, the recent prob-
lems at Lawrence Berkeley have 
raised questions about the universi -
ty's rugher-Ievel management and 
its ability to maintain the country~ 
national laboratories efficiently and 
securely. 

Earlier this year, Senate Energy 
Committee Chair Pete Domenici 
(R-N .M.) announced that the 
University of California's laborato-
ry contract with the Department of 
Energy at Los Alamos Natiortal 
Laboratory will be open to compet-
itive bidding after 60 years with the 
UC system. 

The University of California 
could thus lose management of the 
laboratory for the fir st time since 
its opening.

Dynes: New President will make 
inaugural tour of UC system 

continued from page I 
response," Dynes said. "I surely do not want 
to displace in-state students." 

Dynes also said that the University of 
California might need to rethin1c its partner-
ship agreement with the state. 

"It is time for us to sit down with the 
governor and the state legislature and 
recraft an agreement or recraft an under-
standing of the University of California's 
support and where we're going," he said. "I 
think that hanging on to that agreement 
might not be as fruitful as just deciding that 
we 're going to redefine it." 

Dynes has also announced that the search 
for a vice president of lab management is 
almost complete, and that the University of 
California will seek to retain management of 
Los Alamos National Laborato!}', which will 
be going up for bid due to mismanagement 
problems in the past year. 

His inaugural tour of the UC system will 
include visits of each campus, beginning 
with UC Riverside on Nov. 20 and Nov. 21, 
as well as to New Mexico, home of Los 
Alamos National Laboratory. 

Dynes will also be holding informal Web 
chats open to the public through the UC 
Web site. The chat held on Oct. 8 at 4 :30 
p.m. will focus on alumni issues; on Oct. 14 

, 

~t 10 a.m. it will focus on staff and faculty 
ISSUes; and on Oct. 15 at 4 p.m. it will focus 
on student issues. 

Marsha A. Chandler officially took the 
helm as UCSD's acting chancellor, succeed-
ing Dynes on Oct. 2. 

"This fall is exceptional because of 
UCSD's leadership transition," Chandler 
stated in her welcome message. "During this 
time, we will be worlcing hard to ensure that 
it is a smooth one, and we are determined, 
throughout this period, to keep building 
UCSD's momentum and to sustain our 
excellence." 

The search for a new permanent chan-
cellor has begun. Throughout October, the 
advisory committee as well as faculty sub-
committees will meet to review nominations 
and applications for the post before narrow-
ing the pool of candidates to number 
between six and eight in December. In 
January, the advisory committee will meet 
and interview the candidates and Dynes will 
then recommend the chancellor finalist to 
the UC Regents during a closed session. 
The new UCSD chancellor will then be 
named sometime during winter or spring 
quarter. 

Appl ications and resumes are due by Oct. 
IS.

Strike: Graduate student union 
seeks right to "sympathy strikes" 

continued from /JOlt I 
eight undergraduate campuses, broke down 
on Sept. 30 after six months. According to 
UAW officials, this was due to the 
University of California's "attempting to 
single out" the union among unions with 
similar contracts and aslcing them to stop 
supporting other unions' labor actions in 
"sympathy strikes." 

"We want to send a clear message that 
they can't treat us differently from other 
unions," said Beth Rayfield, UAWs 
Southern California representative. "This is 
something our members found outrageous." 

The UAW has filed 64 unfair labor prac-
tice charges against the 
University of California for 
bargaining in bad faith. 

" 

to join in other unions' strikes so long as they 
did not interfere with their duties. 

"Because the law and principles of good-
faith negotiating require that the full bar-
gaining process including impasse proce-
dures be completed before strilcing, we very 
much regret the union's decision to ask our 
student employees to consider a strike at this 
time," said Judith W. Boyette, UC associate 
vice president for human resources and ben-
efits. "Still, we remain hopeful that resolu-
tion is near." 

On the UCSD campus, approximately 50 
graduate student instructors picketed on the 
corner of Gilman Drive and Osler Avenue in 

"We just basically want to 
put a Stop to the UC admin-
istration's attempt to weaken 
the contract," said Anthony 
Navarrevte, a Muir Writing 
Program teaching assistant. 
"Their ultimate goal is to get 
rid of the union and they're 
using illegal tactics and 
stalling tactics in hopes that 
we' ll be discouraged, that 
we'll just go away, but that's 
not going to happen. We're 
here to show strength to the

the morning, with more 
protesters replacing each 
other throughout the day. 
Later, protesters walked 
around campus, including 
Student Center and Price 
Center, ending up at the 
administration complex, 
where they voiced their 
message to the administra-
tion from a loudspeaker. 

campus community that the union 's just not 
going to stand for it." 

While the union felt the strike was legal, 
claiming the right to protest unfair treatment 
by the university, UC officials called it ille-
gal. 

"The union claims such a strike is legally 
justified because it has filed unfair labor 
practice charges against the University," UC 
Office of the President representatives stat-
ed in a press release dated Oct. 2. "However, 
what should be made clear is that either side 
can file as many ULPs as they like, and sim-
ply because one party may do so does not 
mean the charges have merit." 

UCOP also contended that UC srudent 
employees were, under contract, only allowed 

"There were thousands 
of people out on every cam-
pus," Rayfield said . "It was a 
mad house, which is really 
exciting, but it's unfortu -
nate it has come to this." 

Some students who found their sections 
or discussion groups deserted were frus-
trated. 

"I thin1c it's ridiculous we 're spending all 
this money and they're not helping us," John 
Muir College freshman Lauren Canacari 
said. " I asked my TA questions about the 
reading and he said, 'I can't answer your 
question because I'm on strike,' which was 
really upsetting to me." 

Rayfield said the union hoped to send a 
strong message to UC President Robert C. 
Dynes, who took office O ct. 2. 

"We feel that this is an inauspicious start 
to his administration," Rayfield said. "We 
hope this is not a sign of things to come with 
President Dynes."

T he Free Clinic Project of UCSD is not your typica l free clinic. [n this free clin-
ic, doctors, students and communi-
ty volunteers throughout the San 
Diego County provide medical , 
pharmaceutical and dental services 
in three different San Diego loca-
tions to just about anyone who 
seeks treatement. 

Established in 1997 at the 
Pacific Beach Methodist Church 
by UCSD School of Medicine 's Dr. 
E llen Beck and a handful of UCSD 
medical students, the clinic was 
formed with the desire to provide 
health ca re for those in need . 
Although the clinic initially provid-
ed limited medical ca re, over the 
last six years the proj ec t has 
expanded to two additional si tes in 
San Diego ounty, at the First 
Lutheran hurch tn dowtown an 
Diego and Frt!d Baker Elementary 
in the 'Iountain View neighbor-
hood, and now boasts a three-
tiered ~y tem that Includes a med-
ical clinic, a pharmac(:utieal clinic 
and a dental cl illic at each site.

grams, the Free Chnic Project pro-

"The dental clinic is really help-

exceeds that required of the cur-

The patients, however, are not 
the only beneficiaries. Wilson 
Leung, the current student director 
for the dental clinics, described the 
many benefits of this sort of hands-
on experience. 

"You can think of this as boot 
camp for dental school," Leung 
said. "After being part of the pro-
gram for over a year and going off 
into dental school , you will be way 
ahead of everyone else." 

Largely initiated by UCSD 
alumni Eric Coldlust and developed 
by Horst, the dental clinic has 
grown tremendously since its begin-
ning in 1999. In 2000, Horst also 
founded the Pre-Dental tudy Club 
at UCSD to supplement a lack of 
dental information offered by 
Ca reer Services Center and the 
deteriorated UC D Pre-Dental 

ociery. Hor t explamed that the 
Pre-Dental tudy Club sprang from 
the free dental clinic, and IS open to 
any major. 

Under the supcn<i Ion of newly 
appointed dental advisor Dr. Irvin 
Silverstein, the Pre-Dental ' tudy 
Club will hos t an impressive line of 
guest speaker thi fall, including 
admi sions dean from even dental

He praised the Free CliniC 
Operation, describing the benefits 
students receive in "knowing what 
dentistry is all about," feeling the 
"satisfaction of helping other peo-
ple," and getting them "i n tOuch 
with filling out their applications 
[for dental school I." 

Leung said that there were ben-
efits of learning from the volunteer 
dentists becau e they essentially 
become the supervising dental fac-
ulty during the clinic 's ses ions. 

Leung and Silver tein will also 
oversee the ren ovation of the 
Pacific Beach dental clinic this year,

I COLLEGE SURVIVAL GUIDE 
Laundry day made easy with simple tips to keep clothes clean and fresh 

By KARLA DeVRIES 
Features Editor 

T here is a sille ll in the tiny 
dorm room and it is growing. After 
emptying the trash and scouring 
your roommate's desk for old food, 
it starts to dawn on you. It's coming 
from the pile of je~ns, sweaty gym 
socks, wet towels and t-shirts. As 
you nea r the bottom of your draw-
er, forced to we:lr that free shirt 
t hey handed you at freshme n ori-
e ntation, you rea li ze the day ha 
finally come. It is lau ndry day, my 
frie nd . If it is your first time, grab 
those <Iuarters, follow the kids with 
the baskets and head to the com-
munal washe r and dryer for a lit-
tle laundry lesson. 

First things first - orting 
"Vhile it is possible to throw 

together a ll dirty laundry into o ne 
tuffed load, this metllOd is not rec-

ommended. 
C lothes should be orted first 

b y color. Darks and ligh t are 
washed separate ly to avoid color 
bleeding. I f you are feeling particu-
larly confident in your laund ry 
abi lities. put whites in th(!ir own 
load and use bleach . D on 't worry, 
the use of bleach will be explained 
hortl y. 

If c(,rrai n items are very soil ed, 
do not W3 h them with your less 
dirty it(!ms, ev~n uf the same 
color. In addition , reading the 
tags is always a good idea, a~ ~ome 
materials h ave pecial needs . 

orne items require gentle c)'cles 
or shouldn 't be put in the dryer. If 
somedling sa)'s " D ry Clean 
Only," then dry clean it. 0 one 
wants a doll-si7.cd sweater at the 
end of the wa h . 

bove all, check the pockets 

before washi ng. The damage one 
forgotten lipstick or an o ld movie 
ticket ca n inflict on clothes is 
extensive. T his is a pai nful les on 
you do nor want to lea rn the hard 
way. 

Loads of fun - Wa h cycles 
Load ing the washe r properly i 

an important step that often gets 
overlooked by laundry begin ners. 
Th e washer shouldn 't be stuffed 
toO full or the clothes wi ll not be 
able to move and get fu lly clean. 0 
spring for the extra 1.50 and avoid 
globs of detergent on your clothes. 
Also, distribute the load evenly 0 
the washer tub wiil stay balanced. 

I t is now time for the detergent. 
Pour the suggested amount, usual -
ly a fuil cap or scoop, into the 
detergent receptacle. Most of the 
resident hail \Va he rs have th is, but 
in other models, the soap is placed 
directly into t he tub with the 
clothes. Bleach should only be used 
with loads of whites. Pour a smail 
amount of bleach in with a hot 
water cycle. 

Place the quarters in the 
machine and choose the appropri -
ate cycle for your load. Follow the 
in tructions on the tags, though 
cold cycles a re gener:l ll a .. afe bet 
if you arc unsure. Mo t washers 
require a couple selection~, which 
determine \\ atcr temperature, 
duration of wash and speed of the 
spi nning. It all sound a bit comp li-
cated, but really, it's not. Plu , if 
),ou pres~ the ~rong button, you 
can immedia tely press another and 
it will witch to that cycle. 

You now have ahout -to minutes 
to kill. et a timer '>0 you kllo\\ 
... hen [0 come hack for the bundl) . 

The witch - Transferring from 

washer to dryer 
Once the cycle is finished, move 

clothes to the dryer. Be su re to get 
there on time o r you may find your 
wet clothes have been pawed by a 
stranger and thrown on the table so 
they could use you r washer. Again, 
be sure to read the tags - do not 
put it in the d rye r if it says " lay flat 
to dry." There is a reason they 
make those tags, so pay attention . 

After taking out you r delicate 
items, throw the load in the dryer 
with a dryer sheet. T his adds soft-
Il ess and he lps e limin ate static. 
While you can opt to skip dryer 
sheets, be aware that your clothes 
wiil not be as Downy fresh as your 
mom always kept them. Put in the 
quarters and shut the dryer door 
before se lecting a cycle. T h ese are 
based on temperaru re, so keep the 
tag instructions in mind. 

In 45 minute, you'll have fresh 
clothes once more. H ang up imme-
diately to avoid wrinkles - or JUSt 
toss them on the floor where they 
will be easily acces iblc and wait for 
laundry day to come again. ou 'iI 
know it by the faded t- hirt in the 
bottom of the drawer. 

tains and uch - Get it out fast 
There are way to treat stains 

you thillk wiil never come out, but 
try to get them before they dry. 
Il ere are a few common ones. 

offec: Saturate the ,talll with 
a pr~treatment >tain remover. Rub 
the stain with a heavy-duty liquid 
detergent and launder in hottest 
wa ter sa fe for the fa hric. 

Ballpoint P en Ink: First , saru -
rate material with an alcohol -
ba ' cd hair spray. The alcohol con-
tent in the hair spray will break up 

the ink . Be ure to place an 
ab orbent paper towel or rag 
under the ~t3in to catch the 
excess. Then blot the stain with a 
rag. Repeat the process until the 
stain is removed, then launder as 
usual. A word of caution before 
trying this method : some fabrics 
may be damaged by hair s pray. If 
in doubt, test on an inconspicuous 
area first , or consult with a pro fes -
sional dry cleaner. 

Mud: tart by scraping off 
whatever rou can . Soak and agitate 
in water to remove any more mate-
rial. oak tough stains in water 
mixed with detergent for about 30 
minutes .. oak old stains for several 
hour . Launder normally, rinse and 
inspect before drying. If the tain 

remains, oak ag-din before wash-
ing.

continued from page 9 
Pharmaceutical clinic faculty 

member Dr. David Adler said there 
is a "very small budget" the pharma-
ceutical clinic has for purchasing 
medicine. While they are able to 
maintain a supply of generic drugs 
largely used for acute illnesses, the 
clinic must n1rn to other resources 
for more costly medication in treat-
ing chronic ailments. The Patient 
Assistance Program, a program 
mandated by Congress that provides 
free medication to indigent patients, 
is where the clinic ttlrns to on behalf 
of many of their patients' needs. 
Procuring drugs from individual 
companies, however, can be a pro-
longed and painful period as each 
pharmaceutical company has its own 
standards and regulations for Patient 
Assist:lnce Prognms, and may not 
highly prioritize providing medicine 
to social programs. For needy 
patients at the clinic, this can mean 
at lea t an eight-week waiting peri-
od, and often even longer. 

To combat the detrimental 
delay, Adler will be working with a 
group of pharmaceutical represen-
tatives toward creating a servIce 
project that will provide medica-
tion in the form of samples or larg-
er quantities during the waiting 
perioJ . 

" \Vc 're cenainly intere ted in 
samples that would fit our formu-
lated needs from places that have 
samples and aren't using them," 

dler said. 
He assened, however, that the 

donated samples must be WIthin the 
expiration date and mu t fit thei r 
formulated needs ill order to avoid 
useless dona Dons, which actually 
end up being a great disservice. 

Beck's goal for the upcoming 
year is to crea te a network tha t 
includes all surrounding clinics and 
hospitals in the San Diego region. 
In this network, patients would 
receive respite care, wound care and 
a place to rest during what he 
called , "that interim period 
between the hospiul and being in 
the streets. II 

Beck. a native Canadian, affirmed 
that univer al health care is possible 
for the United States, but feels that 
the counoy must mature and not 
fear social responsibility. She hopes 
that her ideas on a single-payer sys-
tem of health care, where insurance 
companies are demoted to a minimal 
role, and setting price control on 
pharmaceuticals and certain medical 
procedures will be heard and imple-
mented. 

"People's ~ickne~s and death 
shouldn 't be a source of profit," 
Beck saId. 

In this effort, Beck is working 
toward increa ing resources and 
the quality of ~ervlccs available at 
the clinic. Although the UC D 
Free Clinic Project ha already 
scrved as a model for five other 
universities throughout the United 

[lite, including C Irvine, Beck 
hopes that ignificant changes wtil 
be made in order to provide h alth 
care 10 all in 5 iety. 

"We all have a oclal responsi-
bility, " Beck aid. "Everyone does. 
Otherwise, how docs 3 ociety 'ur-
vivc? Social rc ponsibility I 311

MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

FaliFest: Concert showcases blend 
of hip~hop, rap and pop ... punk 

continued from page r 
again . T he closing act was Common, a hip-
hop emcee from Brooklyn, N .Y., who drew a 
large crowd of students that began dancing as 
soon as the music began pl ayi ng. 

Common even called up two students 
from the crowd to become a part of his per-
formance. A female was as ked [0 join 
Common onstage, while later in the show, a 
male was asked to perform as an emcee with 
him. Nearing the end of the show, all anell-
tion was turned toward Common's OJ as he 
performed a five-minute solo that electrified 
an already captivated and interactive crowd. 

" It keeps on getting better every year," 
John Muir College senior John Chang said. 

Host OJ Lambda was surprised with the 
crowd's response and praised the variety of 
the different musical acts of the night. 

"[The crowd] was better than I expected 
for a college crowd," he said. "It was awe-
some - the [A.S. organizers] got music from 
all the genres." 

Fall Fest was one of the first free and high-
ly publicized A.S. events of the new school 
year. The combination of rap, pop·punk and 
hip-hop drew a large and diverse crowd. 

Kushner was satisfied with the night 'S 
turnout. 

"All the bands just love our school, and the 
school seems to love the bands," he said. 

Tibo.. Girczyc-8lumlGuor<ion 
RIMAe rock: Guitarist Heath of the punk rock 
band Midtown performs to a packed RIMAe Arena. 

When asked if he 'd like to see any 
improvements next year, Kushner said, "Just 
bigger and better." 

Jackson: Reverend asks students 
to vote, participate in politics 

conrinl<ed from page I 
"Whenever young America comes alive 

and choo es sacrifice over greed, whenever 
young America chooses hope over dope, and 
plans futures and not funerals, you always 
make America better," Jackson said. 

During the night,Jackson recounted Stories 
of the 1960s civi l rights movement and dis-
cussed how those same issues are still pertinent 
today. The topics he discussed varied from ter· 
rviism in America to economic problems. 

He also addre sed the upcoming reca ll 
election, calling it the right·wing's anempt to 
sabotage the governor by usi ng the "weight of 
media and all the weight of our atuieties." 

Jackson encouraged the audience to vote 
"no" on the recall and to vote for gubernato-
rial candidate LI. Gov. ru l. Bustamante. 

"The money used on this re all could be 
u ed in lowering tuition cost in this state," 
Jackson said. "It is a misuse of money." 

Defending the governor, Jackson pointed to 
the corporate corruption of those involved with 
President George W. Bu hs administration. 
I Ie also argued that California' budget crisis is 
being worsened by the macks on Davis. 

"We need negotiators, not terminators," 
Ja kson said. "Democrats negotiate, resolve 
conflict through some rational process." 

Admitting that there are some dire econom-
ic problems in the state, Jackson pointed out 
that the crisis was also propagated by the Enron 
scandal , which he connected to the Bush 
administration. He al 0 stated that alifornia is 
only one among a number of states experienc-
ing budget deficits caused by "corporate cor-
mption." Jackson also felt that the Bush admin-

istration's tax cuts for the top one percent have 
contributed to the rise in student fees. 

"You try feeding, you try watering a flower 
on the leaves and not on the roots," Jackson 
said. "So you keep putting more money on 
the top leaf and not on the roots. We need to 
invest in health care, education, housing and 
job craining from the bottom up." 

His speech also addressed the controversy 
over Prop. 54, calling it a continuing attempt 
to "undermine equal opportunity." He 
argued that the state needs to have the data 
that Prop. 54 would ban in order to maintain 
the present quality of life. 

Jackson also refuted claims that Prop. 54 's 
necessary to obtain a colorblind society. 

"Vie don't need the convenience of being 
color blind. \Nho scrives to be blind?" Jackson 
said . "Those who are blind srrive to ee-
there is such virtue in being able to see." 

Member of the audience were also 
allowed to ask questions after Jackson's 
speech. Topics that were brought up ranged 
from cu rrent event to tudent activism. 
Snldents that attended the event expressed 
their opinions on whatJackson had to say. 

"His comments were prcny much wh at we 
expected, but they were sti ll insightful to a 
degree, " said Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore arah Piazza. 

For A.S. Vice President of External Affai rs 
Harish andagopal, having Jackson speak to 
students, whether they agreed with him or not, 
was a way to help mobilize students to vote. 

"Even for tho e who didn't agree with him 
for what he believes in, we just wanted to see 
what he had to ay," Nandagopal said.

THE UCSD OUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2003 

Men's soccer: UCSD falls to 5,,3 in CCAA 
conlinued from page 20 

went into the game ranked 25th 
nationally. T hey lead the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
North, and this is the first season 
ever that the Chico State men's 
soccer team has enjoyed success. 

"We were heading into a steam-
roller. They are really on a roll this 
season," UC D head coach Derek 
Armstrong said. 

Chico State controlled the ball 
for the majority of the match, while 
UCSD never really got into a 
rhythm offensively and couldn't 
manage to put together many seri-
ous scoring threats. 

Chico State scored its first two 
goals within the opening 25 min-
utes of the game. T he first score 
came at 16: 15 when junior forward 
Chris Wondolowski took the ball 
down the right sideline, passed it to 
teammate Rusty Phillips who gath-
ered the ball wi th his back to the 
goal, took his time to turn around, 
and placed the ball in the left cor-
ner of the net. 

"They got an early goal , and it 
really didn't sit well with us," 
Armstrong said. "1 think we lost 
some of our confidence and could-
n't do much after that. n 

The Wildcats added a second 
goal to their lead at the 23: I3 mark. 
Off of a comer kick by Chico State 
senior midfielder Brett Williams, 
senior defender Jesse Grigg headed 
the ball into the left corner of the 
net. 

Rebecca Dlexler/Guorcion 
OH pard: UCSD senior defender Jonathan Shum fakes out Chico State's 
midfielder Michael Esser and steals the ball in the Tritons' 3-1 loss on Oct. 3 

After sitting on a 2-0 halfti me 
lead, Phillips got his second goal of 
the game and fi fth of the season in 
the game's 77th minute. Freshmen 
midfielders Jason Phillips and 
Michael Esser set up Rusty Phill ips 
in the right corner. 

The Tritons gOt on the score-
board three minutes later when 
junior forward liago Venturi placed 
a through-ball to teammate Gram 

ishio. The sophomore forward 

earned a penalty kicle after being 
tripped trom behind by a Wildcat 
defender in the box. Nishio convert-
ed on the penalty kick to record his 
third goal of the season. 

UCSD finally began 10 pene-
trate the Chico State goal several 
times in the last 20 minutes, but it 
couldn't claw its way back into the 
game. Coming off an upset over 
then- ranked N o. 2 CSU 
Dominguez Hills on Sept. 28, the 
Tritons lost some confidence in the 
3-1 loss to the Wildcats. 

"Going from a high just a cou-
ple of days ago, it was disappoint-
ing," Armstrong said.

Two days after the Triton loss to 
Chico State, UCSD took on UC 
Davis, which was tied for the 
CCAA orth division lead with the 
Wildcats heading into the week-
end. The Aggie are ineligible for 
the CCAA Championship because 
Davis is in its final year of Division 
II member hip be ore moving up 
to Division I. The results of the 
Oct. 5 game 31 Triton occer

Libero Denelle Smalley made a tri -
umphant return to the position she played 
much of last season, picking up a match-
high 16 digs to pace the Tritons. 

For the third match in a row, UC D 
significantly out-hit its opponent attacking 
at a .324 clip on the evening compared to 
the ggies' .106. 

Ohta - the conductor of the Tritons' 
offensive symphony - credited teamwork 
and a sense of mutual responsibility as the 
keys to the efficient manner with which 
UCSD was able to pick up :1 trio of wins. 

"I think Itlle key was} ju t cOllling

the end. Lautenschleger may have 
gotten a finger on the ball as it 
grazed the lower portion of the 
crossbar and into the goal. She 
then booted the ball to midfield. 

"Those are the kinds of goals 
goalies get beat by," McManus said 
of the deep goal. "Jalnie played every 
ball well before that. he had a good 
game." 

The two sllccessive goals seemed 
to deflate the Triton, who began to 
play more in their own end, as Chico 
tatc pu hed a bit more offensively. 

But that was as close as the visitors 
wuuld come to victory. 

Senior 'hannon Harrel on 
banged home the tying goal in the 
48tll rrunute after UCSD scoring 
leader Kristin Jones passed the ball 
back from the goalie box to 
Ilarrelson at the 18-yard line. In the 

71st minute, senior Amy oker put 
the game away for good when Chico 
State's goalie misplayed her shot. 

UC 0 picked up an insurance 
goal in the 83rd lninute to round out 
the scoring. The attack developed 
from the defense, which wa a theme 
during the second half. Senior 
Christine Wensel found herself 15 
yards of space and pushed forward 
with the baJJ . he passed up the left 
flank toJones, who advanced the ball 
one player further to Cochran. 
Cochran ser-ed the ball toward the 
tOP of the box and after a lircle 
scramble, the ball rolled tOward 
freshmen Heather ugg. She one-
timed the ball into the left corner, 
not even giving the goalie a chance. 

" It just happened that T was able 
to find the space to push up," 
Wensel said. She was a constant 
menace to Chico State in the sec-

ond hal f, setting up numerous plays 
for the forwa rds. 

Excluding the late parr of the first 
half, the Tritons dominated the 
entire game. They led in corner 
kicks, 9-2 . One corner teetered on 
the edge of the goal line before the 
Chico State goa1ie pounced on it. A 
set piece inside the Chico State box 
bent around a wall, only to clang off 
the inside of the left po t. 

The Tritons suffered a loss of a 
different sort early in the COntest. 
Freshmen Megan Dickey collided 
with goalie Angela Orr, sending 
Dickey hard to the ground. he was 
taken off the field and did not return. 

IcManus speculate an injured 
meniscus. 

"We'll see tomorrow," he said. 
"Our freshmen played well toc!ay. 
Losing Megan would be t,:lUgh for 
our midfield."

In sports, 
stats mean 
more than 
skin color 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 
1 don 't think Rush Limbaugh is 

a racist. 1 do think Rush Limbaugh 
is 3 moron. 

Limbaugh's racially charged 
comments last week on ESPN's 
"Sunday FL Countdown" show 
led to his resignation in the midst 
of controversy and put issues of 
race on one place they don't 
belong: the sports page. 

The remarks in question sur-
round Philadelphia Eagles quarter-
back Donovan McNabb, whose 
reputation, Limbaugh claims, is 
due to more than his football abili-
ties alone. 

"I think what we've had here is 
a little ocial concern in the NFL. 
The media has been very desirous 
that a black quarterback do well," 
Lilnbaugh said. "There is a little 
hope invested in Mc abb, and he 
got a lot of credit for the perfor-
mance of this team that he didn 't 
deserve." 

The motives for such a com-
ment are certainly questionable -
though if a black analyst like 
Michael Irvin had made them , 
there wouldn 't be quite this stir. A 
line was crossed that should never 
have been approached. 

In sports, the blaek and white is 
a referee 's uniform, not ethnicity. 
Light and dark are home and 
away, not skin colors. Black , 
white, blue or orange, If you score 
four touchdowns for my fantasy 
football team this week, I'm your 
biggest fan . 

Limbaugh's comments are the 
kind of thing that taints the purity 
of sports. Though athletic compe-
titions have been used as backdrops 
to social, poliocal and revolution-
ary statements in the past, the core 
of the games remains the same. 
Pl.ay because you enjoy it . Play to 
Wlfl . 

There is a sort of narural selec-
tion inherent in sports because 
the strong win and the weak lose. 
The standard of excellence is nei-
ther blurry nor graduated, and it 
defies racial characteriz.ation. A 
basketball hoop 's diameter 
remains the same, regardless of 
the shooter. A shotput's weight 
remains the same no maner who 
hurls It . 

When E P hjred Limbaugh 
to analyze the FL this sea on, it 
failed to realaze the effect that 
would follow. We as sports fans 
are polarized already. We have 
teams we support unconditionally 
and rival s we hate as second 
nature. The only races we care 
about are pennant races, the 
Kentucky Derby and the Daytona 
500. 

Less LImbaugh IS fine by me, 
but I hope that his replacement WIll 
take heed . Martin Luther King Jr. 
descnbed "that day when all of 

od ' children , black men and 
whIte men, Jews and entilcs, 
Protestants and Cathohes, will be 
able to join hand ," and had he 
lived to see today, I think he would 
smIle each time two teams line up 
for the national anthem before 
kickoff.

Tritons serve up a trio of wins 
Women's volleyball sweeps three on the road 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Exhibiting deadly efficiency, the 
second-ranked UCSD women's 
volleyball team dispatched 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association challengers Grand 
Canyon, Chico State and UC Davis 
in three games apiece to improve to 
14-2 overall and 8-1 in conference. 

The Tritons traveled to Ariwna 
on Oct. 1 for a mid-week matchup 
with the Antelopes of Grand 
Canyon. The match lasted just 71 
minutes as the Tritons dominated, 
3-0 (3 0-14, 30-21, 30-18). 

UCSD was superior in every 

major statistical category, out-hit-
ting, out-blocking and thoroughly 
out-playing the Antelopes. Outside 
hitter Lindsay Crandell led the 
Tritons with 12 kills while setter 
Teresa Ohta guided UCSD to a 
.38 1 hitting percentage on the 
match while picking up 36 assists 
and 11 digs. Grand Canyon hit just 
.044 for the match. 

After returJUng from Phoenix, 
the Triton ladies repacked their 
bags and headed north to take on 
the Chico State Wildcats on Oct. 3. 
Though the Wildcats were able to 
keep the score somewhat close, the 
Tritons were never in danger as 
they cruised to a 3-0 win (30-24, 30-

Surpassing even the previous 

night's performance, UCSD hit

just .159. Outside hitter Stacy 
Dunsmore was the offensive and 
defensive leader for the Tritons with 
16 kiUs and just one error while also 
posting 10 digs. Middle blockers 
Kendra Canape and Katie Hogan 
were solid for UCSD as well . 
Hogan tallied 10 kills and five 
blocks alongside Canape, who had 
nine ki lls and three blocks. 

Opposite hitter Ashley Peterson 
returned to the lineup in limited 
action after being sidelined with a 
sprained ankle la t week in practice. 
Opposite hitter Lauren Mills, who 
has picked up the slack in Peterson's 
absence, had five kills, five assists 
and nine digs on the evening. 

The following night, the Tritons 
snapped UC Davis' home winning 
streak at seven matches to take the
