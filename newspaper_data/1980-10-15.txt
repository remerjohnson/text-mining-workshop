Campu police forcibly

picketing a reception by UC 
President David Saxon for 
new Chancellor Atkinson. 

No one wa injured or

Buck was the only non-

reception who honored the 
AS picket line. He is Student

The AS was protesting the 
selection of Chancellor 
Atkinson by a search 
committee it argued didn't

US-Mexican probes 
nations' relations 

BY SHEu..EY SUSSMAN 
Living in San Diego, one is 

constantly aware of the 
proximity of Mexico. Not 
only do the countries share a 
common border, butthey also 
share many of the same 
economic and cultural needs. 

These factors, along with 
an urgent need to explore 
inter-relationships between 
the two countries, prompted 
this year's formation of the 
new United State -Mexican 
Studies Program. 

The program with a staff of 
eight is the nation's largest 
university-based program to 
deal exclusively with US-
Mexican relations . As a 
research center, the program 
focuses on such issues as 

Today's Weather 
Night and morning low 

clouds with a chance of 
light sprinkle in the 
afternoon. The lows will 
be in the low 60s with the 
highs in the high 60s. 

Mexican migration to the 
United States, trade relations 
and US private investment in 
Mexico. 

Although the program will 
explore US-Mexican border 
problems. it will primarily 
focus on broader national 
issues, according to Wayne 
Cornelius, program director 
and UCSD political science 
profe sor. 

The program also provides 
public education on Mexico 
and a research library 
containing original research 
conducted by the program 
staff. 

The program is currently 
conducting a three-year 
study of the impact of 
Mexican immigration on 
health care and labor market 
conditions in San Diego 
County. According to Leo 
Chavel, program research 
coordinator, the study will 
examine family structure, 
migration history and health

Saxon addresses issues 
Though his reception for Chancellor 

Atkinson was marred by the forced removal 
of 25 students by campus police, President 
Saxon otherwise spent a quiet day on 
campus. 

He met with campus and San Diego area 
high school counselors and recruiters to 
discuss t he university's efforts to win new 
students at a 7:30 am breakfast, addressed a 
La Jolla Rotary Club luncheon at noon and a 
student press conference at 2 pm. 

Some excerpts from various statements 
Saxon made throughout the day: 

• 
"There's a problem with student 

government. It generally tries very hard to 
represent students, but that's a difficult 
thing at best to do becau e there are 0 many 
different kinds of tudents. 

"People who are in student government are 
generally interested in participating in 
student government, so their interests are 
narrow. 

"There are times members of tudent 
government have expre ed their own views 
instead of tho e of students. 

"I remember one case when it wa really 
bad and irritated me. Student poll indicated 
that tudents thought Allan Bakke should 
have been admitted to the university." 

(Bakke, a white student, argued 
succe sfully before the US Supreme Court 
that UC Davis' affirmative action program 
discriminated against whites, specifically 
himself). 

"The polls also indicated that students 
were even against giving preferential 
treatment in hiring, but I never heard a word 
of that from student governments. 

"Of course, this is one case where the 

students were wrong, but that is still a 
problem." 

• 
"Choose between Carter and Reagan? Well 

of course, Carter's rhetoric is better, but he 
hasn't been able to deliver so far . Maybe 
Reagan could do better. Some university 
presidents met with him and said he wasn't 
so bad. 

"Of course, Clark Kerr and Charles Hitch 
(UC president and Berkeley chanc;ellor while 
Reagan was state governor) might not agree 
with me, but Reagan, I heard, did get better in 
the last few years of his term." 

• 
"We told Berkeley that we encouraged 

them to go ahead and explore the semester 
sy tern. The chancellor' kicked it around , 
and we think it can be done without 
switching the whole ystem over. 

"There are problems with tran fer, and 
articulation of programs, but we think they 
are solvable." 

• 
"Propo ition 13 probably won't effect us 

much in 1980-81 (becau e there are till state 
surplu funds left). But that will come to an 
end in 1981-82, and it'll be tougher then. 

"The budget office says we won't get much 
more than a one percent increa e in spending 
thi year. With inflation at nine or ten 
percent , that mean we're taking a 
substantial cut. 

"My own calculation how that our 
budget could be up five or six percent. Of 
course, that' still lagging two to three 
percent behind inflation. But we don't know 
how that will effect us."

Says Carter isn't better 
Editor: 

If Ronald Reagan is senile, 
Peter Laura (Th, Daily 
Guardian, Oct. 13) must be 
too. What or who does he 
think caused America to 
begin deteriorating? Ronald 
Reapn? 

All this talk about 
Reagan's possible incompe' 
tence in foreign matters 
,urprises me. Let's look at 
the man who's already had 
four fears of foreign policy 
expenence. 

Under Carter's admini· 
stration, the US took both 
aides of a Middle East issue in 
the United Nations, thereby 
makill8 temporary enemies 
instead of friends of both 
sides. His "hard line" on the 
Soviets for invading 
AfIIhanistan has been to cut 
«f anin sales profitable to 
American farmers and 
therefore to the entire 
American economy (which 
has not: done too well under 
Carter's "lets be nice to 
everyone" policies). Ironi· 
cally, this policy mntinues to 
sell the SOviets an assembly 
line to build V-12 diesel tank 
engines US Ntws aM World 
Rt/»rl Oct. 6, 1980). 

And who has a worse 
memory, Reagan or Carter? 
Has Carter forgotten that he 

wasn't going to campaign 
until the hostages were 
released? Who could ask for a 
more earnest or sincere 
president? And I wonder 
when he's going to light the 
White House Christmas tree. 

An these accusations that 
Reagan is a politician and not 
a_president also surprise me. 
.what a coincidence that on 
the eve of the primaries the 
Carter administration 
granted federal aid to the 
states where Kennedy and 
Carter were running neck -in-
neck, namely Ohio and 
Pennsylvania Oack Ander-
Son, July 1980). And why 
should someone worry 
~bout foreign policy 
eJCP.erience and the lack of 
political influence in the 
administration when we 
have a secretary of state as 
experienced in foreign 
matters and immune to 
politics as former Senator 
~mund Muskie? 

In fact, no president in 
recent history has been aided 
in his campaign with 
speeches by both the 
secretary of defense and the 
secretary of state. Robert 
Strauss, Carter's campaign 
chairman, said the reason 
Carter is not doing better in 
the campaign thus far is that 

Reagan attack a surprise 
Editor: 

With the arrival of another 
~ht, crisp autumn, the free 
citltzenS of the United States 
d America once again enjoy 

th~ privilege of the 
presidential election. 

Peter Laura's vague, 
obscure, amorphous, tire-
some and facetIOUS editorial 
on former Gov. Reagan was 
as stupid as he 8ccused 

~an of being. Instead of 
criticizing the candidates 
true faluts, he chose to use 
slander to try and smear 
him. 

Reagan is not senile nor 
stupia. Under Eisenhower, 
the oldest president the US 
has had yet, the country 
prospered. Just because 
Law it has a bias against 
being old (why, I don't know) 
he has to slander the candi· 
date. 

Former Gov. Reagan is 
accus~ of sacrificing the 
present for the future. On the 
contrary, Reagan, unlike 
Carter, has always thought 
ahead. Education was cut 
(while he was governor) 
because the budget was 
unbalanced. A government 
deficit destroys the economy, 
and thinking of the future, he 
balanced the budget. No 
president has been able to 
balance the federal

Govenor. Reagan's POSiton 

on a strong defense is not 
"sabre·rattling." The US 
armed forces are minority, 
uneducated people who 
couldn't find jobs. It is stupid 
to rely on illiterate people to 
control multi·million dollar 
machines. Look at the record, 
In the last 70 years 
Democrats have started 
every war and the Republi-
cans have ended every one in 
their terms. 

Reagan's economic policy 
is, what should have been 
done ten years ago: cut both 
taxes and IJOvernment. This 
will both stimulate theecono-
my and slow inflation. The 
massive debts Jimmy Carter 
has been running have 
caused the worst inflation 
since World War II. 

What America needs now 
is a strong leader - a leader 
who will bring us out of the 
mess the peanut farmer has 
created. Reagan is by no 
means a good candidate. He 
has many faults and I would 
rather see many other people 
in his place. But, neither 
petty slander (such as 
comparing Reagan to Hitler) 
nor his faults will keep 
Reagan from defeating the 
bumbler, Carter. 

GAVIN WILKINSON 

The Daily Guardian 

be's not campaigning 
enough. Another comment is 
that Carter is "tryin~ too 
hard to ru n the cou ntry. '(LA 
Times). 

With regard to accusations 
that Reagan is trigger·happy 
and apt to start a war, I ask 
Laura, who instigated the 
draft? Who sent military 
aircraft to the Middle East to 
a'ttempt to rescue the 
hostages and in that attempt, 
killed eight of our own men? 

Who has proven himself 
lhcompetent and thus 
become more than disliked by 
the president of possibly our 
most faithful ally, West 
Germany? I would like to 
remind Laura, ac; well as the 
San Diego Students for Peace 
(which I, as one who is of 
draft age, sincerely believe is 
a worthy cause), that 
whether there is peace or not 
is most often dictated not by 
us but by our adversaries. 

What I ·really can't believe 
is Laura's quote of Don 
Blackwell, who says, "He's 
only human, just like 
everybody else." If, in 
Laura's view, Hitler is 
human. then I have never 

heard of a person who isn't. 
So why does someone need to 
tell us that Reagan is human? 
Who cares? 

Finally, I' can't think of a 
better example of 'yellow 
journalism than Laura's 
fetter, except maybe the new 
indictor. I resent the fact that 
my activity fees go to pay for 
that piece of journalistic 
excrement. I would start the 

Wednesday, October 15, 1980 

antithesis of it, but I have 
little to prove and I think it 
would just be parasitic. 

I would remmd Laura that 
not the Chronicle but the Sa" 
Francisco Examiner is 
Hearst·owned. Next time I 
see something anti-anybody 
in the Guardian , I would hope 
that at least some of the 
opinions are based in fact.

Fog and Night Action 
Editor: 

We have decided to announce our symbol to the UCSD 
community: the swaztika. While we have been made aware 
that this symbol was used by a German dictator during the 
1930s and 40s, we are sure that our use of it will not be 
misunderstood. We are, of course, not referring to or praising 
that regime, bur derive our inspiration from the ancient 
Indian origins of the symbol itself. 

On the broader canvas of world history. we are much more 
important and well· known than the dictator regime, so we feel 
confident the no one will misunderstand. Few people even 
remember the details of that earlier period, so it may be 
superfluous to even brinlr it up. 

We end with a salute to the beauty and symmetries of our

Jog, and you die, tOO .•. 

BY B. MACDONALD 
"If they're in such a 

hurry," the curious 6-year-
old dau~hter of a friend of 
mine said, "why don't they 
just take the bus?" The 
astute little lady was as 
perplexed as I am. Why, I 
keep wondering, do these 
joggers do this to 
themselves? 

I see you joggers, crazed 
and gasping, darting 
through campus, plunging 
through the eucalyptus 
trees, dashing along the 
beach and bolting around 
the block. Some of you 
even run with a friend. 
Misery enjoys company, I 
guess . 

Say what you want, but 
you ruin a perfectly serene 
morning to get up early 
and run . You spoil idyllic 
evenings by succumbing 
to a futile kinetic 
obsession. You buy weird 
striped rocket shoes and 
special shirts and pants 
just to sweat into. 

But I did once read 
something good about 
jogging: it gives otherwise 
effete people something to 
believe in. 

I can understand the 
psychological mechanics 
to a point, since everyone 
needs a vice or something 
to make excuses for - but 
why this, when there are 
so many other equally 
useless activities that 
require less trouble and 
pointless exertion?

I heard a good quote

Either you're sickly or

I think you really know: 
it's genes and state of

more important than any

I hear the other half of 
you. It's psychological, 
right? You actually like to 
jog; you feel it relieves

NEWS BRIEFS 

Carter signs news 
room search bill 

WASHINGTON - Presi-
dent Carter signed a bill 
yesterday designed to 
prevent surprise police 
searches of newsrooms. 

The legislation requires 
police to request voluntary 
cooperation when seeking 
information from news· 
gathering organizations or 
use a subpoena that can be 
contested in court, rather 
than arriving unannounced 
with a search warrant. 

The exceptions are when 
there is reason to believe that 
the person who has the 
material sought by police 
committed the crime, when 
immediate seizure is needed 
to prevent death or serious 
injury, when the material 
would be destroyed or altered 
if advance notice were given 
through a subpoena or when 
further delay would threaten 
the interests of justice. 

The bill stems from a 1978 
Supreme Court decision that 
upheld a search of the offices 
of a Stanford University 

student newspaper by police 
with a search warrant. 

In addition to news 
organizations, the bill also 
applies to scholars and others 
engaged in activ ities 
protected by the Firs t 
Amendment guarantee of 
freedom of speech and the 
press. 

The bill applies only to 
those engaged in writing and 
newsgathering, and requires 
the Justice Department to 
formulate guidelines regard· 
ing conduct of s urpri se 
searches by federal authori -
ties. 

Church's action 
was illegal 

RICHMOND, Va. - A 
church·run school acted 
unconstitutionally when it 

. expelled a white girl for her 
friendship with a black 
youth, a federal appeals court 
ruled yesterday. 

The Daily Guardian 

DOONESBURY 

The decision by the 4th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
reversed a lower court ruling 
which held that the 
Marumsco Christian School 
in Woodbridge observed a 
legitimate religious doctrine 
that opposed interracial 
romance. 

It said the Rev. Aleck 
Bledsoe, school principal and 
pastor of Marumsco Baptist 
Church, acted because of 
personal beliefs and not· 
because of church doctrine. 

Bledsoe had cited such a 
doctrine in defending his 
expulsion last year of a white 
girl , Lisa Fiedler, who he 
believed was romantically 
involved with a black 
student. 

The school argued that its 
religious pract ices were 
protected by the U.S . 
Constitution, claiming U.S. 
District Judge Oren R. Lewis 
was correct in finding that 
the girl, who was then 14, had 
no constitutional right to 
attend a church school when 
her personal actions violated 
church doctrine. 

More Nobel 
prizes awarded 

STOCKHOLM, Sweden 
- The 1980 Nobel prizes in 
physics and chemistry were 
awarded yesterday to four 
Americans and a Briton for 
discoveries that may shed 
li$ht on the universe of the 
dim past and could open the 
door to medical cures of 
tomorrow. 

The choices contin ued 
recent American dominance 
of the Nobel science prizes. 
The British chemistry 
laureate, Frederick Sanger, is 
only the second person to be 
awarded a Nobel Prize twice 
in the same category. 

Sharing the chemistry 
prize with Sanger were Paul 
Berg of Stanford University, 
who IS regarded as the 
"father of genetic engineer-
ing," and Walter Gilbert of 
Harvard University. 

The physics prize was 
shared by James Cronin by 
the University of Chicago 
and Val L. Fitch of Princeton. 
They h~ded a team which

found an abberation in 
natural laws that some 
scientists believe could 
reinforce the disputed big· 
bang theory of the origin of 
the universe. 

Iran bombs 
Baghdad again 

BEIRUT, Lebanon -
Iran 's American·built jets 
bombed Baghdad yesterday 
for the first time in more than 
a ·week. Iraqi ground units 
shot their way slowly over 
marshy terrain in an effort to 
put the Iranian oil·refining 
city of Abadan under siege. 

Iran claimed to have put 
down a Kurdish insurrection 
during two days of fighting 
along the Iran·Turkey 
frontier. And the Iranian 
Parliament was reported to 
have asked other Islamic and 
non·aligned nations to put 
pressure on Iraq to end the 
fighting as new mediation 
efforts got under way. 

An Iraqi military commu· 
nique said 12 civilians were 
wounded in the air attack on 
Baghdad.

captured five of the first ten 
places in the meet. Lilia Urias 
took fourth, Cleridy Lennert 
ran two placed behind in 
sixth and Valerie Williams 
came in at eighth position. 
Picking up the end for the 
Tritons was Julie Zicanno, 
who finished tenth in the 
field of seventeen. 

A swift squad from USIU 
aced the men's race, with 
leader Tim Barley breaking 
the course record. He finished 
the five-mile route in 26.53, a 
full three minutes ahead of 
the closest athlete frem 
UCSD. 

Brett Nielson came into the 
finish lane first for the 
Tritons at 29.56 ending the 
race at 16 of 29 runners. 
Brian Place ran some even six 
minute miles, and finished at 
the lower end of the group in 
eighteenth with a time of 
30.0. 

The coach for both teams, 
Andy Skief, said he was 
"pleased with the results," 
despite the low finish in the 
men's contest. Some 
members of the men's team 
missed Saturday's event 
because of illness, and the 
absence of part of the team 
ruined any hope of a 
respectable finish .

Intramural volleyball 
tourney was no contest 

Jacobs teams with Frankel 
to gain fourth 1M crown 

BY MIKE GOLD TEIN 

5 

On a dreary Saturday morning typical of October, 12 
dedicated volleyball duos arrived at the Main Gym to play in 
the AAA divi ion of the Seventh Annual Men 's Indoor 
Doubles Volleyball tournament. 

Hal Jacobs and Monte Frankel, seeded first in the double 
elimination competition, lived up to their ranking in the 
preliminary rounds. They crui ed into the final s of the 
competition with an unblemi hed 4-0 record. 

The number two seed, Steve Upp and Dennis Shepard 
predict ably encountered Jacobs and Frankel in a be t-of-three 
climactic serie . However: after a taxing 12-10, 11-9 triumph 
in the finals of the losers bracket, Upp and Shepard could not 
hold out again t the top entrant . 

The match began at 3 pm and ended just 35 minutes later as 
Jacobs and Frankel totally dominated play, winning easily , 11-
8,11 -2. 

The championship distinguished Jacobs as the only player 
to win the tournamet for four consecutive years. ") play these 
tournaments for fun, but it' great to win it four year in a 
row," he said. 

In the AA division, Chri Cowen and Larry Sad wick 
captured the title with an impressive 11 -4, 11-9 win over Jim 
Badger and Kirk Claque.

"They didn't ask me to 
leave," Martha Bauman said. 
"They just pushed me out. If 
they'd have asked me to 
leave, I would have." 

AS President Bill Topkis 
asked one of the officers to 
notify him before any police 
action was taken so that he 
could try and peaceably deal 
with any problems. 

But officer Clark Martin 
was t he man he asked to help. 
and Martin said after the 
students had been ejected 
that "it wasn't my decision to 
do anything - he told the 
wrong man." 

Sosna said students 
involved would meet today to 
determine if a lawsuit would 
be filed. 

Chancellor Atkinson, 
informed of the problem, said 
he "would have hoped that 
(the police) gave warning," 
but quickly added that he 
was inside the reception and 
didn't know whether they 
had done so. 

UCSD Public Information 
Director Pau l West, standing 
in the lobby with the 

students when police moved, 
said the students were 
"herded and shoved out," and 
said he saw at least one 
student "picked up by the 
neck ana pushed out." West 
could recall no warning to 
students to disperse. 

Buck noted, "They should 
at lea t have told the 
students that they were 
causing a disturbance. It 
came as a surprise .. .1 just 
heard a bunch of police and 
they were moving people 
away. They picked up Jon 
Bekken and moved him out." 

Campus attorney Nick 
Aguilar said that university 
police have authority to stop 
any "disruption of a 
university function. " 

Aguilar also noted that the 
reception was closed to the 
public, but said that "the 
better way of doing it is to let 
people know and ask them to 
cease their conduct." 

The police action, he said, 
still might have been illegal. 
"They should not use any 
more force than necessary. 
It's a judgement call," 
AR\lilar said. 

Before police moved in, 

Atkin on aid that he 'Would 
establish a working group of 
students to meet with him on 
a regular basis to discuss 
campus problems. 

Topkis said that was a 
significant step toward 
getting input on the vice 
chancellor selections to be 
made this year and generally 
improving student voice in 
the administration, the 
alleged lack of which the AS 
cited as reason for the 
demonstration.

I have to (especially with

But I suppose it takes all

the proper approach, and 
it's been generally

"I don't understand this 
AS protest because they
