A mystery unfolded last year 
when India, on May 13, 
announced that it had set off a 
pair of nuclear blasts. The global 
network of seismometers - sen-
sitive devices buried deep in the 
earth to monitor shock w~\'es 
from distant e~rthquake~ and 
blasts - recorded no faint rum-
bles em~nating from India's 
underground test site in its north-
western desert. There was no 
blip, no twitch of pen or meter 
suggesting the awesome power 
of the atom had just been 
released .

Jill Donofno/Guardian 
IAI ..... CrIsIs': Growing student population has Campus Planning office working to 
accommodate the projected growth. The passing period crunch of students reflects this. 

8 6E1EY1EYE COX 
Senior Staff Writer 

GROWTH: UCSD preparesliJr the pressures ql risi/lg e/lrollme/lt Oller the /lextfew yea~ 
The looming crisis of global 

overpopulation has again 
found its way into the news, as 
the six billionth human is 
scheduled to be born some-
where in the world tomorrow. 

Numerous great leaders, 
thinkers, scientists and politi-
cians continue to struggle with 
ways to assuage the draining 
effects of a growing popula-
tion on the planet'S limited 
resources. UCSD students will 
no doubt empathize with their 
concern as the university 
addresses a little overpopula-
tion crisis of its own. 

The pressures of rising 
enrollment should come as no 
surprise to students who are 
already familiar with the 
"queue," whether it be the line 
outside the Registrar's office, 

the line inside the bookstore or 
the line better known as the 
"waitlist." 

Furthermore, students 
attributing this year's back-to-
school crowding to a phenom-
enal number of people actual-
ly making it to class will be 
disappointed to know it won't 
thin out much over the quar-
ter. A record number of stu-
dents are here to stay and that 
number is expected to keep 
climbing, 

"The dramatic growth 
anticipated for UCSD in this 
next decade has the potential 
to change the campus monu-
mentally," said Revelle college 
Provost Thomas Bond. 

Bond has been with the 
university since 1967, and has 
taught, observed and advised 

thousands of UCSD students 
over the last three decades. 

While Bond has personally 
witnessed UCSD's growth 
from its initial enrollment of 
about 200 undergraduates to 
its present state, wherein it 
educates a record 19,900 stu-
dents, it does not take an 
expert opinion to recognize 
that a booming population of 
UC-eligible high school stu-
dents will bombard UCSD 
with unprecedented growth 
well into the next millennium. 

In the 38 years since its 
inception, UCSD has catapult-
ed to its present spot as one of 
the most prestigious public 
universities in the country. 
Renowned for its research,

Leukemia 
Gene 
Identified 
CANCER:UCSD 
scientists discover cause 
of the childhood disease 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD scientists have uncov-
ered a vital genetic component to 
pediatric leukemia, providing 
important insight into the most 
common form of cancer in chil-
dren. 

Kess Murre and John 
McWhirter from the Department 
of Biology stated in the Sept. 28 
issue of Proceedillgs of tile Natiollal 
Academy of Sciellces how a newly 
discovered gene aids an already-
known gene mutation, promot-
ing the spread of leukemia 
throughout the body. 

In healthy children, cells 
known as "pre-B" cells are pro-
duced by bone marrow. The cells 
mature into "B" cells, and once 
inside the spleen, become 
involved in immune response. In 
pediatric leukemia patients, the 
cells continue dividing indefinite-
ly. 

E2A and PBX are two genes that 
researchers know cause leukemia. 
The E2A protein is responsible for 
developing blood cells and the 
PBX protein functions to develop 
organs such as the brain. 

When these genes fuse togeth-
er in a nucleus, they make a 
mutation characteristic of pedi-
atric leukemia . Until recently, 
however, the effects of this fusion 
were unknown. 

Through their research, Murre 
and McWhirter found an impor-
tant third gene, WNT-16, to be the ' 
missing link in the cancer-causing 
gene mutation. WNT-16 belongs 
to a family of proteins involved in 
cell growth and survival; They 
are also known to induce breast 
cancer in mice.

Torrey Pines Celebrates 100 Years 
PARK: Over I ,000 people gathered to commemorate the anniversary of the state reserve 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Guardian Reporter 

The Torrey Pines State Reserve in Del Mar, 
home of the rarest pine tree in the United 
States, celebrated its 100th anniversary last 
Saturday with a commemoration honoring 
the park and the members that have pre-
served it since its opening in 1899. 

TI1'commemorate the park's success, the 
city of San Diego organized a day-long cele-
bration. In addition to speeches given by 
members of the city council and the 
California Assembly, the more than 1000 
individuals who came to the reserve experi-
enced docent-led nature hikes, basket-weav-
ing demonstrations, nature crafts for chil-

dren and an art exhibit sponsored by the San 
Dieguito Art Guild . . 

Bob Wohl, head supervising ranger of the 
Torrey Pines State Reserve, said the celebra-
tion commemorated not only the park itself 
but also its founders. 

"We want to acknowledge the great vision 
and caring of our predecessors," Wohl said. 
"They were able to see so far into the future 
that this was so unique and worth saving, 
not just for themselves but everyone who 
came after them." 

In 1899, the city of San Diego donated 369 
acres for the development of the Torrey Pines 
City Park. This makes the park the oldest

PINION 

Five Colleges, 
All-campus commencement provides an opportunity 
for UCSD students to unite and celebrate graduation 
By ANGELA CARRIER 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

' ''United we stand, divided we faiL" 
We have all heard thi saying at some 
point in. our lives, but there is a great deal 
of truth in it, especially with regard to the 
future of commencement ceremonies at 
UCSD. 

I don't see why the debate over 
whether or not there should be an ali-cam-
pus commencement even exists. We all 
attend UCSD, and commencement is an 
event that involves the whole campus 
coming together as one to celebrate the 

Besides, the college to which a stu-
dent belongs does not constrain him or 
her to classes or majors solely of that col-
lege. In most of my own classes, there are 
people from all five colleges, and as 
UCSD students we are all subject to the 
same conditions. This will continue in 
this manner for the next four (or more) 
years I spend here. I should hope to 
share the victory of completing college 
with these same people. 

Graduation is an event during which 
we all come together as one to be recog-
nized for our accomplishments. Lyrics to a 
famous song by U2 capture this: "One 

completion of our edu-
cation. •••••••••••• love, one blood. One life, you got to do what you 

should . One life, with 
each other. Sisters. 
Brothers. One life, but 
we're not the same. We 
got to carry each other. 
Carry each other." 

A joint ceremony is 
very important consid-
eri ng that there is obvi-
ous division within the 
campus community. 
There should be no rea-
son to reinforce this sep-
aration by limiting the 
graduation ceremonies 
to the individual five 
colleges. 

ro 
Students are quite proud of their col-

leges, and many have misguided precon-
ceptions about the other colleges on cam-
pus. For example, when I tell people from 
other colleges that I from Roosevelt, I 
sometimes get weird looks or even facial 
expressions displaying disgust. But, I am 
defined by Roosevelt only because of 
where I live and the general education 
requirements that I am required to meet. 
As far as I know, I am still an enrolled stu-
dent of UCSD, just like everyone else. 

These words a're 
meaningful and applica-
ble to everyday life and 
specifically apply to how 

the university's commencement cere-
monies should be. 

Coming together as one is a very sym-
bolic act. In a socIety that is full of divi-
sions based on gender, race, socio-eco-
nomics and age, a university commence-
ment ~eremony wherein five separate col-
leges Jom together is very significant. It 
reveals that we all may be different in our 
preferences for particular colleges, but 
that nonetheless, we are all at the same

Accents Inhibit Learning 
COMMENTARY: Non-fluent professors make lecture non-constructive 
By DNa GUIANG 
Contributi", Opinion W'iter 

I am certainly aware that vis-
. iting professors are renowned 
for their research and awards 
and that permanent UCSD pro-
fessors must possess a wealth of. 
knowledge in their fields to even 
be a part of UCSD's teaching 
staff. Despite all the expertise 
some profe5$Ors have to offer, I 
have found that professors and 
visiting scholars with poor 
English skills impede the acade-
mic performance of their stu-
dents. 

It is not my intention to offend 
those professors for whom 
English is not their primary lan-
guage, those with thick accents or 
those who have diffic;ulties 
expressing themselves in 
English. I am merely concerned 
about the academic well-being of 
UCSD students. 

The definition of a good pro-
fessor is one who posse&ses a 
fluent background in the materi-
al he or she studies and research-
es. In order for professors to be 
good lecturers, however, they 
aJso must be able to convey their 
thoughts and studies on a level 
of discourse proportional to 
their knowledge of a subject. 
Frequently, visiting professors 
are not articulate enough in 
English to fully convey their 
expertise in other areas. 

Many students learn better 
when taught verbally or when 
they can see examples visually, 
especially in math, science and 
engineering courses. When a 
professor, such as a visiting 
scholar, lacks the verbal diction 
to delineate class material 

In order for professors to 
be good lecturers, 
however, they also must 
be able to convey their 
thoughts and studies on 
a level of discourse 
proportional to their 
knowledge of a subject. 
appropriately, it only injures the 
students' ability to grasp course 
material. 

Personally, I have had more 
than my share of classes in 
which professors are incapable 
of delivering adequate lectures 
due to their inadequate knowl-
edge of English or due to their 
heavy accents. From time to 
time, I have had to resort to 
attending my TA's office hours 
instead of lecture in order to 
learn a. class' material. 

While students are often 
comfortable with the complicat-
ed jargon unique to the subject 
matter, they need an articulate 
professor who is understandable 
so that they feel confident learn-
ing the subject matter of their 

courses. When students have to 
break through an accent or when 
they cannot even grasp the cen-
tral idea of a course due to lan-
guage inefficiency, some would 
rather drop the class. 

Traditionally, the only means 
of complaining about this prob-
lem have been the class evalua-
tions that are circulated at the 
end of each quarter. These are, 
by far, not a solution. I equate 
filling 'out class evaluations to 
filling out surveys; they instigate 
no change. 

Professors should not lecture 
when their English is inadequate 
to ensure satisfactory student 
learning. In these cases the pro-
fessor should hand the podium 
to a qualified TA who is capable 
of presenting the class material 
appropriately. More often than 
not, students prefer TAs over 
their professors anyway. 

A good professor is not 
always a good lecturer. For visu-
al students who find it necessary 
to attend class, a good lecturer 
enhances academic performance. 
The next time you sign up for 
your classes, do a little research 
into who is teaching the class, 
especially if the schedule of 
classes merely says "staff." This 
can help you determine whether 
or not the professor is a good 
speaker, or if the class might be 
taught by someone with inade-
quate English. 

Maybe if classes that suffer 
from these communication prob-
lems suffer a lack of enrollment, 
the administration will cu.t back 
on hiring lecturers and profes-
sors that are incapable of fluent-
ly delivering their lectures.

By MELANIE HOHLFELD 
Contributing Opinion ~te, 

Remember the story about the 
man who broke into a woman's 
home, broke his leg and then 
sued the woman and won? Or the 
story of the man who was 
attacked by Dobermans while he 
was breaking into a pumpkin 
patch - he sued the owners, who 
then lost their business due to the 
burden of legal costs. Well if you 
don't already know a story about 
people abusing the legal system, 
don't worry - soon you will. 

Last Thursday, the House of 
Representatives passed the 
patient's bill of rights legislation, 
making it possible for patients to 
sue their health plan providers. 
While it is true that health main-
tenance organization (HMO) 
reform is sorely needed to protect 
patients from companies more 
concerned with bottom lines than 
with actual patients, the ability to 
sue - as outlined in this bill -
will undoubtedly give rise to 
abuses of the system, ultimately 
meaning higher prices for all con-
sumers. 

Although managed health 
care has existed since the turn of 
the century, HMOs didn ' t exist 
until 1973. They were designed 
to offer a viable health care 
option to those unable to afford 
the more expensive and versatile 
services of preferred provider 
organizations (PPOS). 

Currently, HMO plans allow 
patients to see only a certain set 
of doctors chosen by the HMO 
insurance company. Should spe-
cialized care become necessary, 
patients can petition their pri-
mary care physicians (PCPs) to 

see a specialist, such as a derma-
tologist or cancer specialist. 

As required by HMOs, how-
ever, PCPs may not refer more 
than a certain number of 
patients per month. 

Problems arise when PCPs 
refuse to allow patients to see spe-
cialists in order to stay under 
these monthly quotas. HMOs can 
also refuse care to patients if an 
illness is not life-threatening. 
Clearly, the healt!} care system 
needs to be reformed; decisions to 
refuse care should not be made 
by HMO agents who do not 
know what a colonscopy is. The 
power needs to be put in the 
hands of the doctors and patients. 

Passed as a bipartisan bill by a 
vote of 275-151. the Norwood-
Dingell legislation provides 
HMO customers easier access to 
emergency rooms or specialists, 
patients the opportunity to take 
their complaints to independent 
panels and tax breaks for both 
insurance and long term care. 

These are all excellent ideas 
and will be instrumental not only 
in resuscitating the ailing system, 
but also in making it easier for the 
roughly 44 million Americans 
wtlo do not have health insurance 
to get the care that they need. 

These are issues that need to 
be addressed . However, the bill's 
stipulation allowing patients to 
sue HMOs will only result in 
excessive lawsuits. Business spe-
cial-interest groups argue that 
companies could also be drawn 
into litigation,causing prices to 
increase. Therefore as a result of 
system abuse, many businesses 
may drop health care coverage 
completely. 

In the end, this bill may make 

AKJ 

A-.cIatId Stade.u UC SaD Diego t presen: 

it more difficult for the average 
American to have health care. As 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert 
warned, "Wo one has any idea 
what the cost implication would 
be if you went too far." 

Luckily this bill is far from 
law. Clinton has threatened to 
veto any bill that includes tax 
breaks and the Senate has 
already indicated by a vote of 53-
47 that it does not agree with an 
amendment that gives patients 
the option to sue their HMOs. 

The solution is simple. Senate 
Republicans have already pro-
posed a provision allowing HMO 
decisions that refused care to be 
reviewed by an independent doc-
tor or panel, a sort of arbitrator 
who will render a final decision. 
This version. appears to have a 
better outlook, as patients will 
have their cases reviewed by 
medical experts, thus placing the . 
power in the hands of the patients 
and the doctors, not the HMOs. 

This version is also superior 
in that it denies patients the 
right to sue. As a result, HMOs 
will not need to offset the cost of 
legal battles in their insurance 
premiums. This will allow more 
uninsured Americans to get the 
comprehensive care they need . 

In the end, lawsuits will drive 
prices up for all patients, thus 
contradicting the original goal of 
the legislation - to make com-
prehensive health care more 
affordable. 

While HMO reform is des-
perately needed, allowing 
patients to sue will only serve to 
pervert a good idea through 
misuse of the legislation, ulti-
mately making victims of us all .

The idea of five separate col-

that sets UCSD apart from most 
other universities. Each college 
has a personality that its stu-
dents can identify with, and stu-
dents have the ability to choose 
one that caters to their needs and 
desires. 

But, each individual college is 
not a university unto itself, and 
would be incomplete without the 
backbone of UCSD. When UC5D 
students fill out work applica-
tions, they will not just write that 
they were a member of Muir col-

they will perhaps mention that 
they were enrolled in Muir col-

rest of the university. The main 
focus and strong point of each 
college is different, and one ca n-
not be considered better than the 
others, because there is no com-
mon ground by which to compare 
them. 

The size of the graduating 
class from each college vaties 
quite significantly. The number of 
new freshman registered for fall 
quarter of 1998 was different for 
each college. Revelle had 703 
freshmen, Muir had 734, Marshall 
had 627 Warren had 699, and 
Roosevelt had 610. Imagine grad-
uating with such a small class -
it would be like a flashback to 
high school. 

The individual college cere-
monies are indeed shorter and 
more personal, but the whole 
point of coming to college is to be 
in an environment with a variety 
of di.fferent people. In addition, 
the university atmosphere gives

plines apparently did not feel that 
he could offer any epiphanies on 
their own college experiences and 
their passing from undergraduate 
life. UCSD students come from 
very diverse fields, and, while we 
were fortunate to have Jacobs as a 
guest speaker, he couldn't reach 
out to the entire student body the 
way Clinton or Gingrich, could. 

UCSD was designed around 
the multiple-college system 
because it makes an often over-
whelming school the size of 
UCSD more manageable. 

The students enrolled in each 
college share many of the same 
general education requirements 
and classes throughout their stay 
at UCSD, and it is only fitting that 
these should be the people with 
whom they graduate. The joyful 
experience of graduation centers 
around the sharing of these col-
lege ceremonies with friends and 
family; it does not cer:'ter around 
a massive address with students 
and thejr guests arranged like 
ticket holders at a concert. 

I am not saying that UCSD 
should forego the idea of having 
an all-campus commencement 
ever again; I merely believe it 
should be reserved for an excep-

The next time the President of 
the United States, or the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court or 
the Pope decides to speak at 
UCSD, then the entire univerlity

UCSD community, as diverse and 
disparate as it is, there is no justi-
fication for the additional 
headaches and costs that an all-
campus commencement entails. 

We cannot realistically expect to 
have the good fortune of arranging 
a world-class speaker every year 
for graduation, and we should not 
spou the occasion by settling for 
merely adequate speakers or last-
minute replacements. 

AII-campus commencements 
should be saved for truly momen-
tous guests capable of bringing the 
entire UCSD community together. 
We would all like our own gradu-
ations to be such an occasion, but 
unfortunately for most of us, this 
will not be the case. 

For most of us, the speakers at 
our graduations will be the facul-
ty and administrators who 
played such an important role in 
our college careers. In many 
ways, what these people repre-
sent and have to say is far more 
meaningful and memorable thiln 
any words offered by a distin-
guished guest deigning to visit 
our campus for one day out of the 
year to congratulate us after all 
the reill work has been done.

Clinton Jolts Canadians With a Plea for 
National Unity and Federalism

lites. All this, treilty advociltcs

but the smallest blilsts. 

OTTAWA, C.lO.ld.1 
CJI1.1dl.1Il~ on buth ""dt!l> ul the 

natlOn '~ d~p hngul!-tll" diVide 
say they were stunned by 
President Clinton's unexpected-
ly passionate appeal here for 
national unity and federalism. 

Clinton traveled to the f1ash-
point of separatism in North 
Americ.1 and, without once men-
tioning Quebec nationalism, 
argued Friday that "the United 
Stat('!; and C.lOad<'l ,1fe ,Imong 
the most fortunate countries in 
the world because we have such 
diversity. " 

If every major "racial Jnd 
ethnic <'Ind religious group" 
won independence, "we might 
have 800 countries m the world 
and hJve .1 very difficult time 
having a functioning economy," 
Clinlon said , add ressing .1 
forum on feder<'llism th.,t carlier 
in the week had become a plilt-
form for complaints by Quebe( 
separatists . "Mavbe wc would 
h.1\'l· !I,()OO - how low (<'In vuu 
go? . 

"Th., grc.lt Irony of the turn-
II1g of thl' millennium b thJt we 
hilv(' mon.' modern options for 
technology ilnd econumic 
advance than ever before, but 
our major threat IS the most 
primitive human f.liling - the 
fear ot thc other," he s.lld ,It 

Mont Tremblant, north of 
Mllntrcili. 

"Wt' mu~t think of how we 
will live after the shooting 
stops, after the smoke dears, 
over the long run," the presi-
dent said . National indepen-
dence, he warned, is often "il 
questionable assertion in a glob-
al economy where cooperation 
p.,ys greater benefits in every 
area than destructive competi-
tion ." 

"We must think of how 
we will live after the 
shooting stops, after the 
smoke clears, over the 
long run." 

-81n Clinton 
President of the United States 

U.S. leaders traditionally 
sidestcp the hornet's nest of the 
~eparahst aspirations of many 
Quebecers, the centrill political 
qU.1I)dary of Canada for the last 
three decades . In turn, 
Canadians put extraordinary 
weight on the words of the 
president of the United States, 
the nation that dominilte~ 
C.lnada's foreign trade .1Ild 

Investment. 
C.lnada's widely 'read week-

end papers, in both English and 
French, viewed the speech as a 
strong argument for Quebec's 
remaining inside Canada. 

Clinton made "a powerful 
argument in filvor of federalism, 
which he describes as the politi-
cill regime of the future," 
Vincent Marissal wrote in La 

Pr~sse, a Montreal daily that bills 
itself as the largest-circulation 
French newspilper of the 
Americas. "But his message on 
the merits of federillism went 
much further, questioning even 
the usefulness of the nationalist 
projects in the era of globaliza-
tion." 

The English-speaking media 
were less restrained . 

"Clinton Sings Praises of 
United Canada," read a banner 
hc,ldline in TI,e MOil/real Gazeltl', 
one of only two surviving 
English languilge daily newspa-
pers in Quebec. 

The Glo/x' alld Mail, Canada's 
other nationally circulated news-
p"per, declilred, "Clinton's 
speech was the most powerful o 
and subtle ilrgument in favor of 
the federal idea heard in Quebec 
in yeJrs."

tests? Were they flops? Or had 
smilll blasts eluded the eaves-
droppers? And if they had, what 
did that mean for a global ban on 
nucleilr blasts in which compli-
ance WilS to be i1ssiduously veri-
fied? 

These questions have a strong 
beilring on the bruising battle in 
Washington over whether the 
Senate should bless Washington's 
participation in the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 
which more than 150 nations 
have signed. 

Friends and foes have engaged 
in a wilr of words, with arms con-
trol experts from the CIA and the 
Depilrtment of Energy warning 
Congress thilt the United States 
would hilve iI hard time knowing 
if foreign states were secretly set-
ting off small blasts. But two of 
the world's top groups of earth 
scientists weighed in heavily on 
the side of treilty bilckers, silying 
technology could eilsily police the 
ban. 

The test ban supporters say 
that even current sensors are up 
to the job and thilt the network 
Gllled for by the treaty will be 
even better. Moreover, this official 
network will be i1ugmented by 
the rilpid global spread of all 

Though opponents of the 
treilty point to the Indian c1i1im 
as iI test-ban embarrassment, the 
emerging consensus among 
nuclear experts is thilt whilt 
fililed that day was not glob., I 
monitoring gear but the pilir of 
explOSive devices. 

"The Indian claims were 
exaggerilted," silid George 
Perkovich, author of "India's 
Nuclear Bomb" (University of 
Cillifornia), to be published this 
week. The problems were so 
great, he added, that India hild 
another nuclear device in the 
ground that it left undetonilted . 

To police the globe for clan-
destine blasts, the nucleilr test 
ban treaty calls for 321 monitor-
ing stations - 170 to detect 
underground shock waves, 80 to 
sniff the air for telltale radioac-
tivity, 60 to listen for revealing 
sounds and 11 to track underseil 
booms. 

This array of monitoring 
devices should be able to detect 
nuclear blasts as small .,s a kilo-
ton, or equal to 1,000 tons of high 
explosives. On recording gear for 
earthquakes, experts say, such a 
blast would measure about mag-
nitude 4, like a minor tremor.

warned the mdustry that if it did 
not move to shuulder responsibil-
ity on privilcy, the government 
would surely step in. 'Suddenly, 
that threat seemed imminent. 

Yet, two months before the 
FTC report W.,s released, a group 
of companies had already taken a 
collective fi rst step toward trying 
to shore up the Internet indus-
try's credibility on privacy, fend 
off reguliltion and deflect a trade 
war with Europe. 

In April 199~, ~me 60 
lawyers, lobbyists and executives 
- representing companies that 
included Americu Online, IBM, 

Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, 
plus a few trade groups -
formed the Online Privacy

HXl corporations and associations

Judgments about the Online 
Privacy Alliance vary. But there is 
no di5pUt~ that the group has 
strengthened the standing of 
those who believe that a hands-
off approach is the wisest 
Internet policy. The group hilS 
blunted the drive for broad 
Internet privacy legislation or 
strict government regulation.

Biblical Debate Shifts to Cosmos 
Scientific lessons about the 

origins of life have long been 
chilllenged in public schools, but 
some Bible litefillists are now 
adding the reigning theory 
~bout the origin of the universe 
to their list of targets . 

I c,Hly ove rlooked In the 
turm over the K,lIl~.I!> Bo~rd of 
Educiltion's decision in August to 
remove cvolution from ib cduc.,-
tion standards was a deci!>lon on 
the much wider realm governed 
by the science of the cosmos. 

Influenced by il handful of 
scientists whose literal faith in 
the Bible has helped persuade 
them that the universe is only a 
few thousilnd years old, the 
board deleted from its standards 
a description of the Big Bang 
theory of cosmic origins, the cen-
tral organizing principle of mod-
ern astronomy and cosmology. 

The Big Bang theory, based 
on decades of astronomicill 
observations and physics 
research, suggests that the uni-
verse originated in a colossal 
explosion of matter and radia-
tion some 15 billion years ago. 

But "young Earth creation-
ists," as they are generillly 
known, have come up with their 
own theories to explain how cos-
mic history could be condensed 
into mere thousands of years. 
They are making this case in 

book~, pamphlets and lectures, ilS 
well as on a number of web sites. 

Mainstream scientists consid-
er their theories to be wildly out 
of line with reality, even though 
books describing them are often 
liberillly sprinkled with refer-
ences to authorities like Albert 
Einstein and Stephen Hawking. 

As a result, physical scientists 
now find themselves in a fight in 
which they have seldom played 
a public role. They have 
responded with a mixture of dis-
dain, disbelief and consterna-
tion, and the reactions have not 
been limited to physicists and 
cosmologists in Kansas. 

"It's the denial 6f what 
understanding we have of the 
origin of the universe in terms of 
modern science," said Jerome 
Friedman, a physicist at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 

Technology who was awarded a 
Nobel Prize in 1990 for collabo-
rating in the discovery of the 
subatomic particles called 
quarks ilnd is the president of 
the American Physical SOCiety. 

"That's il terrible loss," 
Friedman said. 

Hume A. Feldmiln, a cosmolo-
gist at the University of Kansils in 
·Lawrence who has worked at 
Princeton University ilnd the 
Canadian Institute for Theoretical 
Astrophysics, said that develop-
ments in Kansas bore a distant 
resemblance to the difficulties of 
political scientists under commu-
nist regimes in Eilstern Europe. 

But advocates of the creation-
ist view say alarm over their the-
ories is overblown. Steve 
Abrams, a member of the Kilnsas 
board and veterinariiln in 
Arkansas City who was among 
the leaders of the push to milke 
the changes, said there are legiti-
mate scientific doubts about 
whether the universe is more 
than 'several thousand years old .

The UCSD Guardian Monday, October II, 1999 

Jill Donofno/Guardian 
Torr.y PInes: The state reserve. just north of UCSD. attracts over 1 million visitors each year. 

PARK: 
Preserve is home to 
2,000 native plants 
Conti ...... "HI INC. 1 
urban natural preserve In file 
United States. Fifty years later, 
after it reached a size of over 
2,000 acres, the park became a 
state reserve and was later desig-
n<?ted a. National Natural 
Landmark due to the importance 
of the park's trees. 

The Torrey Pine was recog-
nized as a unique species in 1850 
by botanist Charles Christopher 
Parry while he was searching for 
the border between Mexico and 
the United States. The tree is 
nicknamed California's birth 
tree because it was discovered 
the same year the state entered 
the union . Today, the Torrey 
Pine c<ln be found in only two 
places on Earth: Santa Rosa 
Island in Santa Barbara and San 
Diego. 

Peter McMullen, grandson of 
Guy Flemming, one of the leaders 
in the fou nding of the preserve, 
said the preservation of the 
reserve is crucia l to the city. 

"This place is the jewel in San 

Diego's crown," McMullen said . 
"We need to do everything we 
CJn to preserve the unique char-
acter of this pl~ce . " 

The preserve is now home to 
over 2,000 n~tive plants, 200 
migrant and resident birds and 
many species of animals includ-
in).\ dolphins and bobcats. 

Despite having over 1 mil-
lion visitors each year, Wohl 
said that the college students 
from this area rarely utilize the 
preserve. 

"It is ironic how few students 
come here," Wohl said. "This 
should be one of the best and 
most heavily used areas around. 
People can read a book for hours 
at a time, bicycle or just find a 
respite from the stresses of slu-
dent life." 

In spite of what the park offers 
its visi tors now, McMullen said 
there is always a thance problems 
will arise in the l·uture. 

"Nothing is forever," 
McMullen said . "Nothing should 
be taken for granted." 

Wohl said that-the key to a 
successful future lies in maintain-
ing the park openings that are 
under the freeway. Currently, 
they act as a b~rricade from the 
urbanized world for animals 

such as the mountain lions, bob-
cats, foxes and coyotes that reside 
within the reserve. The openings 
also allow the animals to travel to 
other natural areas. 

"We need something on the 
other side of the freeway where 
the animals can go back and forth 
from here to Carmel Mountain 
Mesa," he said. "If that is lost 
then the legacy of Torrey Pines 
will be sad ." 

The closing of more of this 
land could lead to an infestation 
of rodents, whose population is 
currently controlled by the 
reserve's carnivorous animals. 

Already, the land connecting 
the preserve to Carmel Mountain 
Road has been paved over and 
lost to urbanization. 

For now, however, many seem 
to feel that the park's visitors 
should just enjoy and appreciate 
the reserve for all its glory. 

"When I went back and read 
the proclamation back through 
the resolution 100 years ago, it 
states this will always be free 
and open to the public," City 
Council member Barbara Warden 
said. "I think to have that sort of 
foresight 100 years ago, some-
body deserves an awful lot of 
credit."

Considerations of population growth in light of 
the.college system and- undergraduate enrollment 

CONnNUE FROM PAGE 1 

especially in the sciences, UCSO has 
attained the reputation necessary to 
attract some of the best and brightest 
minds to the campus within both its fac-
ulty and student body. 

It seems safe to say that UCSO has 
earned its place in the elite academic 
tier of the UC system, attracting a sim-
ilar number and quality of applicants 
as the much older and larger UC 
Berkeley and UCLA. Last year 32,464 
applications were received for just 
over 3,300 slots in UCSD's freshman 
class, the second highest number 
received by any school in the UC sys-
tem. The entering class' SAT scores 
and GPAs were among the highest in 
UCSO history. 

While the caliber of students is 
worth noting. so is the number of 
applicants. UCSD has been academi-
cany competitive with UCLA and 
Berkeley for some time, but only 
recently has the number of potential 
students approached the numbers seen 
by these two much larger schools. 
UCSO seems destined to be-
grouped with these elite uni-
versities, historically in acade-
mic prestige and now in size. 

This means that after years 
of fairly constant, and some-
times declining, enrollment, 
UCSO should prepare for sev-
eral years of explosive growth. 
By the 2006-2007 school year, 
the Campus Planning office 
predicts total enrollment will 
reach nearly 24,000. 

Anyone who has had to fight 
for the last yellow parking spot at 
high noon, enter a lottery to earn a

housing or get to class early to find

competing for these limited

Surprisingly enough, for UCSD 
to reacn a size comparable to that of 
Berkeley or UCLA was part of the orig-
Inal vision of the Academic Master Plan 
of 1963. which aimed for total enroll-
ment of 27,500 students in eight under-
graduate colleges and six professional 
schools. Though conceived over three 
decades ago, the idea of building a large 
public research university that could 
provide the intimacy and attention of a 
small coJlege is a philosophy that has 
been maintained up to the present-day. 

The looming e"rollment crisis, cou-
pled with concerns over inadequate 
funding as well as the ongoing debate of 
how to balance faculty research with 
undergraduate curriculum, begs the 
question: how can UCSO preserve these 
original w>als and the quality of student 
life throughout its future of unavoidable 
and. sustained growth? 

The CoHeae Syst .... 
H As we grow, we have to preserve the 
col~ system, and we are committed to 
that, said Bond, who in addition to his 
lengthy career with the university, also 
speaks from experience, working closely 
with the accreditation committee. 
"There isn't anything like the college 
system." • 

According to the master rlan, the col-
lege system at UCSD is 'designed to 
give a small college experience to under-
graduates at a large public university." 
The success of this mission statement is 
debatable, according to both Bond and 
the findings of the accreditat;on commit-
tee. 

"Have we met the ideal? No. These 
Ire not small colleges with a lot of facul-
ty tttention and interaction," says Bond. 

"However, is it better than an extremely 
large school like UCLA or Berkeley? I 
think so." 

Bond points out that the structure of 
the college system at UCSO allows for a 
connection between the academic and 
personal aspects of the college experi-
ence. 

Josephine Roberts/GlMntlan 

clearly has compromised UCSO's ability 
to provide individual attention to its stu-
dents, says Bond: "Students are happier 
socially because of some of the facilities 
a centralized Student Affairs can offer, 
fncluding RIMAC and the Price Center. I 
think, though, that they are not quite as 
happy as they were before, in terms of 

"Have we met the ideal? No. These are not small 
colleges with a lot of faculty attention and interac-
tion. However, is it better than an extremely .large 
school like UCLA or Berkeley? I think so." 

HThe college system brings Academic 
Affairs and Student Affairs together, 
something which is not done at other 
campuses. This affiliation recognizes 
that what happens outside the class-
room is as important as what happens 
inside," Bond said. 

As both the number of colleges, and 
their individual enrollments grew, stu-
dent affairs became more centralized, 
and aCl'demic affairs remained the 
responsibility of the individual colleges. 
Consequently, students now have less 
affiliation with their colleges, detracting 
from UCSO's ability to provide the per-
sonal attention and small-college atmos-
phere toward which it originally 
aspired.

college system toward campus unity

their intellectual associations. The chal-
lenge is to maintain intellectual life 
while at the same time recognizing that 

~he ~rsonal/sociallife has to be central-
Ized." 

To prepare for the enrollment surge, 
plans for a sixth and eventually seVenth 
UCSO college are in the works. In the 
immediate future, construction for the 
new Eleanor Roosevelt College in the 
north part of the UCSO campus is sched-

uled to bettln next fall. The $83 million 
project is designed to house nearly 1000 
students in dorms, apartments and an 
International House, and will also pro-
vide dining facilities, meeting rooms 
and a new parking structure. 

Bond hopes that by developing more 
colleges, UCSD will be able to preserve 

at least some aspects of the small college 
intimacy as it grows: "You are looking 
for two things out of an education: per-
sonal growth and academic g.rowth. 
Colleges are better at promoting acade-
mic development when they are small-
er." 

Though college-specific social plan-
ning seems to have been replaced by a 
more realistic strategy of centralizing 
student affairs, Bond hopes that both the 
new and existing colleges will work to 
develop their own "esprit." 

"Students in earlier years felt more of 
an association with their college," he 
recalls . "I loved the college system 
because, if students get into the right col-
lege, it is a real nice match and they can 
flourish." 

u~ EducatIon 
The way in which enrollment growth 

threatens the individual importance of 
students is in no way a problem unique 
to the college system. The majority of 
academic departments are faced with 
the same conundrum. 

While almost all departments have 
had to resqrt to offering large, imper-
sonal lower-division courses, the sci-
ences appear especially hard-hit by 
enrollment increases. Between 1987 and 
1997, ~he number of students in sci-
ence/math majors increased 37 percent, 
compared to a campus-wide growth 
rate of 11 percent. 

Despite the demand for certain class-

Culinary Delights Found in Price Center 
Finding a good meal at the Price Center isn't as difficult as it seems. 
By BETH ARNESE 
Food Critic 

It was noon by the time I 
reached campus, so I wasn't sur-
prised to see that the lines to Sub-
way and Wendy'S were longer 
than the bathroom lines at the 
Sun God Festival. As I fought my 
way through the crowds of soror-
ity girls in matching outfits, fra-
ternity guys with matching hair-
styles and freshmen with match-
ing faces, something occurred to 
me. DoII't people get sick of Subway 
and Welldy's? 

For three years I have listened 
to people complain about the 
food in Price Center and I will 
not tolerate the complaints any 
more! If I ate a triple-bacon 
cheeseburger with fries and a 
coke every day for lunch for 
three years, I too would hate 
Price Center food . Thus, I take 
my new mission to reveal the 
best-kept secrets of Price Cente'r 
food very seriously. 

First, I have a confession to 
make. I am such a fan of Price 
Center food that I once forced my 
best friend to come with me to 
campus on a Saturday because I 
was craving Tia Molly's. While I 
am not asking that you take such 
extreme measures with your own 
culinary choices, I would like you 
to at least know what you are 
missing. 

I begin my journey at Espresso 
Roma, which enables UCSD stu-
dents to remain awake during 
drab lectures, lengthy midterms 
and Geisel marathons. The wide 
variety of bagels, scones and 
cookies are freshly baked, allow-
ing for some great smells to drift 

through Price Center. Roma is 
open from 7 a.m. to midnight 
Monday through Thursday, Fri-
day from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Satur-
day from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 
Sunday from 9 a.m. to midnight. 

Everyone knows that Roma 
offers a decent cup of coffee at a 
reasonable price (51.25 ), but I bet 
most students don't know that 
the soup it serves is also excellent. 
I recently tried the split pea and 
ham (51.95) and was deliciously 
surprised . That day I was particu-
larly tired and not feeling well, 
but the soup's homemade taste 
perked me right up - I even 
peeked in the kitchen to make 
sure my mom wasn't in there 
cooking. 

In fact, I was so perked up 
after my appetizer that I found 
enough energy to wait in the Sub-
way line. Although you may 
think I hate Subway, I really do 
enjoy a nice sandwich every now 
and then - I guess you could say 
I believe in Subway in mode.ra-
tion. 

I ordered a meatball

often necessitates express food, 
and when you have a craving for 
Mexican, Express Mexican cui-
sine is the place to eat. Express 
Mexican cuisine provides the 
most basic Mexican food items, 
already preyared for enjoyment. 

In class unraveled my little 
bundle of joy. Everyone turned to 
look my way because it smeUed 
so good. The burrito was steam-
ing hot with the perfect propor. 
tion of creamy beans and melted 
cheese. 

With class over, at lut the time 
had come for me to eat at my per-
sonal favorite, TIa Molly's. TIa 
Molly's has a vast array of Mexi-
can food, ranging from the mo~ 
obscure potato quesadilla (52.42) 
to the standard chicken enchilada 
(53.25). I love everything at TIa 
Molly's so much that I usually 
cannot decide what to order. That 
day, I opted for my regular chick-

en tostada (52.75). My begin-
ning-of-the-school-year-
gloom dissipated as I 
savored each delicious 

sub ($2.69) and was .. c::::~!!!!.;~ 
not disappointed. 
Meatball subs are

proud to sav that I missed Til

served really hot and I usually 
find myself scarfing them down. 
You might think that this is the 
sure way to heart disease, but I 
am happy to tell you that it's real-
ly not that bad for you. In fact, 
most things on the menu are very 
healthy - this is, of course, 
excluding of those plastic squares 
called "cheese." 

After my sandwich, I noticed 
the crowded area to the right of 
Subway. The line usually con-
sists of mostly professors, TAs 

and 
a few stu-
dents. r 
strolled up to the Express Mexi-
can Cuisine and ordered a bean 
and cheese burrito (S1.86). With 
five minutes left, I grabbed it to ' 
go; just a snack to tide me over 
for my next hour of class. TIme 

Although TIa Molly'S is a hard 
act to follow, I believe in the abil-
ity of the Burrito Station. The Bur-
rito Station is unique because you 
can watch your burrito being 
made and customize it as you 
wish. While vegetarians are more 
easily satisfied at the Burrito Sta-
tion, adventurous carnivores 
may also find their palates satis-
fied by the shrimp burrito (53.95). 

Personally, I was in the mood 
for something on the lighter side. 
After all, I'd been feasting on deli-
cious food all day. I decided that a

up in a whole tvheat tortilla. As 
much as I genuinely enjoy this 
burrito by itself, I find it even 
more tasty when I smother it in 
peanut sauce, For a moment I was 
no Ionaer in the Price Center, but

rant. 

I opened my eyes and moved 
on to Star Wraps, I am usually 
baffled at this stop because every-
thing on the menu sounds so 
appetizing. 

Some think that Star Wraps is 
just another rendition of the 
recent wrap craze, but Star Wraps 
is different. It outlives these fla-
grant wrap trends with its addi-
tions of salads and fresh juice 
drinks. 

I picked the mango shrimp 
wrap (53.60) and then wondered 
whether I should have been 
scared to eat shrimp from the 
back rooms of Price Center. Yet, 
when I took that first bite, and 
that slightly sweet flavor hovered 
dangerously close to spilling over 
my chin, my fears vanished in the 
steam. I especially appreciated 
my mango shrimp wrap because 
it is something 1 would never 
cook at home. 

My next stop was unavoid-
able: Wendy'S. Fortunately, the 
lines were long enough to give 
me plenty of time to decide. 
When I reached the front I 
ordered a spicy chicken sandwich 
(52.99), and I have to admit, it 
was tasty. The spiciness was at

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX LUNCH: Inexpensive, tasty 
food ready to order Fencing Team Enriches College Experience 

JULIA KULLA-MADER 
Editor in Chief 

Looking back on my college 
experience, I call summarize 
what has made the last four 
years unique and extraordinary 
in one word: 

Fencing. 
As a member of UCSD's 

Intercollegiate Fencing Team, 
I've traveled up and down the 
California coast, fenced 
Olympians and beginners and 
gained a profound appreciation 
for fencing movies such as "The 
Princess Bride." 

What makes fencing such an 
incredible sport is that anyone 
can learn to do it. Although I 
first started in high school, 
many of my teammates didn ' t 
pick up a foil, epee or saber 
until college. Some of those 
same teammates beat me on a 
regular basis. 

Fencing was somewhat of a 
godsend for me. I've never been 
an incredible athlete, yet I am 
quite competitive and enjoy 
team sports. I participated in a 
bevy of sports before finding 
fencing - but was never very 
good at any of them. As a high 
school student, my basketball 
career consisted of being asked 
by the coach to elbow as many 

people as possible because, 
according to her, I couldn't 
pass, shoot or dribble. 

However, in fencing, partic-
ularly epee fencing, my unique 
combination of skills is consid-
ered a plus. I'm tall and left-
handed, and both of these char-
acteristics have contributed to 
my success on the fencing strip. 
Being tall comes in handy 
because my arms are longer 
than my female opponents', 
and being left-handed is useful 
because most fencers are not 
used to fencing lefties. 

My right-handed teammates 
will vouch for the fact that it is 
not necessary to be tall or left-
handed to fence, however. 

women who fence are an inter-
esting breed nonetheless. My 
female teammates are all athlet-
ic, confident, intelligent and 
kind. But, that's about all they 
have in common. The women of 
the team have a variety of inter-
ests outside fencing, including 
dancing, engineering and draw-
ing. 

Both the men and women.on 
the team are hard workers -
on and off the fencing strip. I'm 
constantly amazed by how 
smart my teammates are. A few 
years ago, our team won an 
award for having the highest 
average GPA of any intercolle-
giate team. 

I don't think it's an accident 

Fencing has made college 
worthwhile for me because it has 
given me the chance to be a part of 
a team, and a unique one at that. 
Prospective male and female 
fencers will be successful as 
long as they are eager to learn 
and willing to work hard . 

In addition, it's important to 
note that female fencers don't 
conform to any stereotypes. 
Many people - mostly males 
- picture female fencing as 
some sort of special episode of 
"Xena: Warrior Princess." Con-
trary to popular belief, my 
female teammates and I don't 
consider Xena a role model and 
look nothing like the women on 
"American Gladiators" . Yet, 

that fencers tend to do well aca-
demically. Fencing is a very 
cerebral sport. OUI coach likes 
to say that fencing is 10 percent 
physical and 90 percent mental. 
On the fencing strip, fencers 
have to constantly evaluate 
whether they are opening them-
selves up for attack. In addition, 
fencers must always be think-
ing - like in chess - several 
moves ahead. 

Fencing has helped me learn 
to both trust myself and make 
decisions quickly. While fenc-
ing, I can't afford to overana-

Iyze a particular move. I 
learned early on that not mov-
ing on the fencing strip can lead 
to only one thing - being hit. 

Although fencing is painless, 
having a touch scored against 
you is quite painful in the sense 
that you lose a point. The first 
fencer to score five points (hit. 
his/her opponent five times) 
wins the bout. As a result, fenc-
ing is as much about defense as 
it is about offense. 

But for me, more than any-
thing else, fencing is about 
forming life-long relationships. 
Fencing has made college 
worthwhile for me because it 
has given me the chance to be a 
part of a team, and a unique one 
at that. For the rest of my life I'll 
have something in common 
with a cross-section of people 
around the world. 

In add ilion, through the 
UCSD fencing team I have been 
exposed to both NCAA athletics 
and the international fencing 
community. I'll leave UCSD 
knowing that I am not just the 
average college graduate -I'm 
a fencer and an athlete.

just the right level, setting this 
sandwich apart from an ordinary 
chicken sandwich. 

I have a confession, however: I 
am a huge fan of Wendy'S chili 
chips 'n cheese ($.99). For less 
than a dollar, you can't beat this 
snack. I should note, however, 
that I've only had chips 'n cheese 
during on-campus concerts, and 
never during normal hours. 

At this point, I found myself 
waddling up to Woks Up. Woks 
Up offers so many different 
types of Chinese food that I was 
overwhelmed. The more expen-
sive a·nd special dishes, depicted 
by photos in the background, are 
always sure bets. Only one meal 
togo! 

I already knew that the sweet 
and sour chicken ($ 3.45) and 
chow mein ($2.25) were both 
sure bets, if not a bit greasy. I 
decided to splurge and finish my 
gluttonous parade with some-
thing extravagant: a huge plate 
of rice noodles with beef ($5.57) . 
Even if I hadn't eaten in a week, 
I don't think I could have fin-
ished this plate by myself. My 
advice: if you decide to share, 
make sure it's with a good friend 
because the taste and smell of 
onions permeates your entire 
body. 

. I hope I have inspired you to 
break away from your normal 
Price Center eating habits. 
Remember that when you're try-
ing new things, the worst thing 
that can happen is you won't like 
it!

GROWTH: 
Despite population 
students satisfied 
ContInued froM ..... 11 
es, the accreditation reports 
found that "UCSD has no wide-
spread problems with course 
availability." Academic depart-
ments have dealt effectively with 
the problem by offering more sec-
tions of the impacted classes, and 
choosing effective lecturers for 
the large classes. 

In addition, the biology, eco-
nomics and engineering depart-
ments have all opted to institute a 
pre-major screening rrocess to 
limit the number 0 students 
entering their impacted majors. 
Students must achieve a mini-
mum GPA in the screening cours-
es in order to be admitted to the 
major. 

Hopes are that the pre-major 
screening process will also 
address another problem magni-
fied by enrollment growth: stu-
dents' ability to graduate within 
four years. According to the find-
ings of the accreditation commit-
tee, inadequate academic advis-
ing, coupled with limitations on 
class sizes and course offerings, 
made it difficult for students in 
several impacted majors to grad-
uate on time. 

To address this concern, the 
affected departments took advan-
tage of recent technical improve-
ments as a means to disseminate 
pertinent information about their 
programs.

Nonetheless, as many fifth-

year seniors would attest, gradu-
ation within four years has 
become something of a rarity. 
Without continued efforts to 
improve course offerings and aca-
demic advising. the problem 
stands to worsen with increased 
enrollment. 

While UCSD may have side-
stepped a class-size crisis for now 
and temporarily avoided the 
widespread problems Berkeley 
students face in just getting into 
classes they need to graduate, 
overenrollment continues to 
cause another equally disturbing 
problem: an overworked faculty. 

Though the number of perma-
nent faculty increased from 740 to 
823 between 1987-1997, the rate of 
hiring could not keep pace with 
the rapidity of enrollment 
growth. The faculty-student 
ratios in the impacted depart-
ments reflect this; in the natural 
sciences, the weighted faculty-
student ratio is 1:53.13, and over-
all, in the natural sciences, it is 
1 :38.65. (A weighted faculty-stu-
dent ratio acknowledges the dif-
ferent amount of time a faculty 
member devotes to Ph.D. stu-
dents versus undergrads.) The . 
expected faculty-student ratio is 
1:28.

Major requirements, course 
offerings and online degree 
checks are only a few of many 
services now available via depart-
ment web pages. In addition, the 
engineering department took 
steps to improve advising and 
restructure curriculum such that 
students can graduate within 

While the faculty suffers from 
being overworked, a high faculty-
student ratio also affects the qual-
ity of undergraduate education. 
Without question, one-on-one 
interaction between faculty and 
students is a desired component 
of a college education, but per-
sonal attention is often hard to 
come by in departments where 
the average lecture size is in the 
hundreds. 

Nicholas Runco/Guardian 

To address this problem, 
departments now offer many 
undergraduate seminars, honors 
sections, mentorships and 
research opportunities with facul-

ty. Such programs are effective in • 
bringing faculty and students 
together; however, as UCSD's 
enrollment continues to rise it is 
questionable whether such pro-

GROWTH: 
Higher prices on parking 
passes fund new structure 

questionable whether such programs will 
be enough to compensate for the imperson-
ality of a large lecture class. 

Despite concerns for the future. the 
Quality of Student Life survey taken in 1997 
indicated that at least for now, UCSD stu-
dents are satisfied with their educational 
experiences. An overwhelming 90 ~rcent 
of respondents indicated that their 'ex~­
tations of academic life had been met by 
curriculum at the university. 
ParkInC on Campus 

Already one of the most common stu-
dent complaints, the lack of parking at 
UCSD is a problem extremely sensitive to 
changes in enrollment. 

According to a 1995 joint study by the 

tures will contain 870 and 970 spots, 
respectively, and are slated to open in the 
fall of 2000. 

The three new parking structures, fund-
ed by an increase in parking permit prices, 
promise to be at least a partial solution to 
the parking crisis. In addition, the univer-
sity is exploring alternate methods of 
relieving the parking crisis, varying from 
the introduction of a trolley system con-
necting UCSD with the greater San Diego 
area, to proposals of using a lottery to 
assign permits. 

Presently, the office encourages use of 
alternate transportation by rewarding car-
poolers with reserved spots, and members 
of its "Pedal Club" with free parking per-
mits. Some of Parking Services' other alter-
nate transportation programs include a free 
city bus pass that is valid throughout a 
large portion of San Diego, and free shuttles 
between UCSD and Hillcrest, as well as to 
the Coaster station.

Last year, attempts to alleviate the crisis 
resulted in the allocation of new student 
spots near RIMAC, in east parking Lots 701 
and 702 and in the School of Medicine Lot 
608. Nonetheless, lots continue to fill up on 
a daily basis around UCSD. 

The 1995 study anticipated that UCSD's 
total population will grow 25 percent to 
33,900 in 2005-2006, and that a minimum of 

3~000 new spaces would be needed, espe-
Cially near the University Center where 
parking is extremely limited . 

To address the growing demand, Park-
ing Services kicked off a series of construc-
tion projects in July, with the development 
of the Regents lot. When completed, the 
new Regents lot will provide an additional 
1,552 spots. 

As the number of students increased 
markedly in the past few years, this goal 
has scarcely been met, and instead, UCSD 
has been forced to implement a series of 
d.rastic measures to assuage the housing cri-
SIS. 

Incoming freshmen who miss the hous-
ing deadline lose their on-campus housing 
guarantee, but even those who meet the 
deadline may find themselves in double 
rooms configured as triples, or in tempo-
rary dorm rooms created in what was for-
merly a common area or office of a student 
organization. 

Last year, the shortage was so pro-
nounced that several students had to be 
housed in nearby hotels until space became 
available. . 

Construction of additional on-campus 
housing will not be finished until 2002, 
prompting Vice Chancellor of Business 
Affairs Steven Relyea and Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph Watson to estab-

In addition, construction has begun on 
two parking structures, one located on 
Gilman Drive, near the center of campus,

GROWTH: 
Off-campus housing 
largely unavailable 
c ....... ~ fro. __ 20 
Iish an administrative committee 
to explore alternative housing 
options. 

The findings of the committee 
were presented to Relyea and 
Watson in October of last year 
and are beinJl: implemented. 

The committee suggested that 
housing not be offered to new 
transfer students, incoming 
freshmen who miss the deadline 
or continuing students without a 
guarantee. In addition, the report 
discouraged the use of tempo-
rary housing, which includes 
making triples out of double 
dorm rooms and converting 
other available on-campus space 
into housing. 

Despite the committee's belief 
that temporary housing is "unset-
tling" for residents, 88 temporary 
spaces had to be created this year 
to meet the demand. 

. In addition to changing its 
housing policy, the university is 
planning to construct additional 
apartments to help accommodate 
future enrollment growth . Tenta-

tively, these are scheduled to 
open in the fall of 2001. 

The on-campus housing 
crunch comes at a particularly 
inopportune time, since the typi-
cal "starving student," whim 
forced to live off-campus, will 
encounter a market tainted by 
high rents, low levels of availabil-
ity and an all-around lack' of 
affordable housing. 

Despite increasing costs, the 
vacancy rate is one of the lowest 
in San Diego's history, currently 
falling below 2 percent. In an 
environment that clearly favors 
landlords. rental prices continue 
to rise significantly, especially in 
areas where property is in high 
demand, such as the La 
Jolla/UTC area. 

Students seeking a better deal 
have resorted to relocating to 
other parts of San Diego, like Sor-
rento Valley, C1airemont and Mira 
Mesa, whl!re there is a better 
selection of units at slightly more 
affordable rates. 

Students who continue to live 
close to campus may avoid the 
lengthy commute and enjoy 
some convenience. Many, howev-
er, had to spend months house-
hunting to find a place in one of 
the luxury apartment or condo-
minium communities near cam-

NFL: 
Many surprising 
early results 
C ....... d ".. .... _ 28 
is second to none. 

With only one victory, that 
against the aforementioned 
Broncos, the Jets have looked 
woeful on offense. Everyone who 
thought that the Jets' success last 
year was based on Parcels' sys-
tem (this set inc1ud~ me) has to 
be questioning that this year. 
They play the high-powered 
Jaguars tonight in a game that 
could be as u~ly as the 
Philidelphia Eagles passing 
attack. 

The biggest surprise this year 
is certainly the SI. Louis Rams. 
The team with the worst record in 
the 1990s is undefeilted ilnd has 
dominated every team they have 
faced . 

After losin~ 17 consecutive 
games . to the 4gers over the 
majority of the last decade, the 
Rams squashed San Fransisco 42-
20 yesterday to remain the only 
undefeated team in the league. 
The high powered offense of 51. 
Louis is led by Kurt Warner, an 
NFL newcomer who spent last 
season in the arena league. The 
arrival of Marshall Faulk from 
Indianapolis has also helped the 
team' . 

Going into the season, defens-
es focused on Faulk and tried to 
make the first-year quarterback 
beat them. Su far thb year, 
Warner has been up to the chal-
lenge. 

The other surprise teams this 
year have been the San Diego 
Chargers and the Indianapolis 
Colts. 

Both were expected to be In a 
rebuilding process this yeilr, but 
as of right now, the Chargers are 
in first place and the Colt~ are 
right in the playoff mix . 

The emergence 01 Peyton 
Manning was expected but the 
Chargers' newfound ilbility to 
put points on the boa rd is refresh-
ing and harks back to their run to 
the Super Bowl. 

With their loss to the Dolphins, 
a team forecasted to make the 
5uper Bowl this season, the Colts 
hot streak could be over, but they 
have still impressed early on . 

Without Ry,m Leaf's bad deci-
sion making, the Chargers have 
been able to use their strong 
defense to win ~ames . Last year 
Ryan Leaf was the king of the 
interception (not to mention the 
king of the temper tantrum). With 

, all of these turnovers, the defense 
of the Chargers was unable to 
slop the opposing team because 
they were always working on " 
short field. 

This year, Jim Harbaugh and 
crew have been good enough to 
get off to il 3-1 sta rl. 

Harbaugh hasn't been stellar, 
but he and his backups have been 
good enough to give the defense 
a chance. This is all that Seau and 
his cronies have needed to run 
the Chargers all the way to the 
top of the AFC Wt.'St standings. 

The division is weaker this 
year than it has been in the last 
few years (thanks to the Broncos 
pathetic early season sho"!ing) so 
the division crown ,1Ild a spot in 
the playoffs is up for ~rabs. 1t will 
likely come down tn the Chargers 
and the Seahawks. 

J don't know what all these 
suprises will ,1Inount to, but I 
have learned that nothing is for 
sure in the NFL. L.1St year if I told 
you that I thou~htthat this year's 
Super Bowl matchup w;)s going 
to be the Rams and the Colts most 
of you would have written in ask-
ing me to be admitted. This year 
that matchup doesn't see so far-
fetched. 

Don't expect to see the Browns 
and the 8engab in the Super 
Bowl next year, but if you are 
looking at this year's results, you 
never know.

Water Polo Burns Division I 
UPSET: The Tritons do Division III proud with a victory over UCSB 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

Until this weekend the Triton 
Water Polo team has been a biA 
fish in a little pond. Despite 
amassing an excellent 12-4 
record this year, all 12 wins have 
been against opponents ranked 
lower than UCSD, and nont! of 
those 12 wins has come against a 
Division-I school from the pow-
erful Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. Last Wednesday's 
20-6 pummeling of the 
University of La Vl'rne showed 
that the Tritons had the capabili-
ty to defeat one of these power-
house schools, and the opportu-
nity came this weekend as 
UCSD traveled to 5;)n Francisco 
to play in the annual NorCal 
Tournament. 

This tournament was sched-
uled to be played at Berkeley, 
but due to construction of the 
new Haas Pavilion, the tourna-
ment was moved to Stanford. 

In their first match of 
Saturday's tournament, the 
Tritons took on ninth-ranked UC 
Santa Barbara . Earlier in the 
week, Head Coach Denny 
Harper said that he felt this was 
a match that his team could win, 
and Harper was right - the 
Tritons took the game with sur-
prising ease, finishing with a 
score of 12-6. 

UCSD jumped out to a 3-0 
lead after one quarter and never 
trailed in the game. A seven-goal 

third period iced the game for 
the Tritons as they ran their sea- . 
son record to 13-4. Jonathan 
Samuels, Ryan Dandy and 
Vladimir Djapic led the Triton 
onslaught with 3 goals each, 
while sophomore goalie Glenn 
Busch held the Santa Barbara 
offense at bay with 10 big saves. 
The win was the Tritons' biggest 
so far this year and was also 
their first win over a Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation team in 
the last two years. 

In their second match of the 
day, the Tritons took on Stanford 
University - the nation's top-
ranked team and the winner of 
the prestigious Southern 
California Invitational earlier 
this season. 

Despite these impressive 
accolades, the Tritons knew they 
could play with the Cardinal 
because of a close match played 
aga.nst them in the SoC a I 
Invitational. In this match, the 
Tritons were close the whole 
way and eventually lost by 2 
goals. 

Saturday'S match started out 
promising for the Tritons, as 
they led 1-0 after the first period 
and were tied at two with the 
top-ranked Cardinal after the 

first half. 
Just as in the Triton's first 

match, the third period was the 
decisive one. This time, howev-
er, the period did not end in the 
Tritons' favor. In that period, the 
Cardinal amassed 7 goals 
including one two-point shot 
while the Tritons could only 
manage one score. 

Stanford also took the fourth 
• quarter 3-1 to win the match 13-

4. The match showed both 
UCSD's potential and its need 
for more experience against top-
ranked teams. • 

With that loss, the Tritons' 
record stands at 13-5 after 
Saturday. 

On Sunday, the Tritons faced 
the Air Force Academy for the 
third time this season. The first 
time was a convincing victory 
for the Tritons. In the second 
game, the Tritons fell 9-5 while 
nine of their players were sus-
pended. This time around the 
Tritons took the match-m domi-
nant fashion, 10-4. Samuels was 
again the story, scoring eight of 
the Triton's 10 goals. Ross 
Mecham and Gordon Beh 
chipped in with one goal each . 

In the fifth place match, the 
Triton's final match of the tour-
nament, the Tritons lost a tough 
match, 5-4, to Long Beach State. 
After three periods the Tritons 
were tied with the Division I 
powerhouse but they failed to 
score in the final period of this 
low scoring affair.

SOCCER: 
Team has their best 
play this week 
ContInued fronI PIC- 21 
with so much talent," Cordova 
said. "We wanted it more. We 
didn't want them to win." 

Thjs was the fourth game in a 
row that the Tritons' opponent 
has left a match scoreless, with 
UCSD outscoring opponents 22-0 
during that span. 

"The New York team is always 
very good," Cordova said. 
"They're always strong and phys-
ical and know how to play. They 
don't like to lose." 

Yesterday afternoon, the 
Tritons took on conference rivals 
Cal Lutheran University. With a 
loss to Cal Lu, the Tritons would 
be in grave danger of missing 

th~ postseason, but a victory 
would place the Tritons in the 
driver's seat for a regional tour-
nament berth. As it happened, 
the match was never close as the 

Tritons cruised to a 3-0 victory. 
In the first half the Tritons 

played inspirationally, scoring in 
the 13th minute on a strike by 
Elizabeth Hughes and then again 
in the 25th minute on a 25-yard 
drive by 'Abizaid, tucked just 
under the top of the cross bar. 

"The first half was some of the 
best soccer we havellayed all 
season," McManus sai . "We con-
trolled the ball and kept it on the 
ground in spite of the heat and 
the hard playing surface." 

The second half saw the 
Tritons further dominate play, 
with Dostalek scoring a third goal 
in the 81st minute off of a corner 
kick. 

"The heat started taking its 
toll," McManus said. "We con-
trolled play but we couldn't stick 
it in until late in the half."

eighth-ranked 11-1-1 Tritons con-

What's Going on 
In the NFL? 

I know th:1t I <1m not the 
only one, but e:1rly on in this 
NFL season I :101 very very 
confused. It seems like I <lm in 
some kind of Twilight Zone 
episode where <III the usual 
Super Bowl contenders suck 
while all of the med iocre and 
bad teams are suddenly the 
dominant forces in the league. 

The only thing missing is 
some big blOlck hole sitting in 
the middle of the field, sW<lI-
lowing the pl:1yers into it's 
vast emptiness whenever they 
come near it. 

Will one of these surprise 
teams go on to win the Super 
Bowl? Who knows? But we 
can break down the early 
shockers in the FLso f:1r, and 
the reasons for these stunning 
results. 

The easiest of the fallen jug-
gernauts to understand is the 
Denver Broncos. You might 
say, "How cOIn this be1he easi-
est to unders tand? They were 
the Super Bowl chumps last 
year, and this year they suck." 

Well the ,lnswer is easy. 
Injuries and retirements have 
sent the Broncos spirilling 
from the top of the mountaitl 
all the way down into the vast- . 
ness of the v:1l1ey below. 
Elway's retirement announce-
ment was expected, <lnd it was 
obviously going to be difficult 
to replace the Hall of Fame 
quarterback. 

But when Terrell Davis 
went down last week with a 
season-ending knee injury, the 
Broncos fate as a season-long 
bottom dweller was set in 
stone. To make m<llters worse, 
Shannon Sharpe was injured 
in yesterday'S win against the 
Raiders, leaving the Broncos 
without their three main offen-
sive threats from last yeOlr. 

The Broncos' Superbowl 
opposition, thl:! Atlanta 
Falcons, were :1 pleasant sur-
prise last year, but this year the 
shoe is on the other foot. 
Without the services of their 
star running back Jamal 
Anderson, who had a break-
out year last ye:1r and set the 
NFL record for most carries in 
a season by 01 running back, 
the Falcons have fallen back 
into the cellar. Last year the 
Falcons got by with hard 
work, but this yeM their lack 
of talent is becoming evident. 

They mOlnaged their first 
victory of the season yester-
day, a tough 20-17 overtime 
victory, but triumphs will be 
few and far between for the 
Falcons this ye:1r. 

The New York Jets lost star 
Quarterback Vinny Testaverde 
before the se<lson even began, 
but nobody could have expect-
ed a Bill Parcels co<lched team 
to fold like the Jets have this 
year. 

In spite of losing one of 
their on-field leaders, the Jets 
made it all the W:1y to the NFC 
Championship last year with a 
balanced offense and a work 
ethic installed by Parcels that

A Weekend -of Warriors 
THREE.pEAT: The women's volleyball team won its third tournament of the season this weekend 
By BRIAN WEllES 
Associate Sports Editor 

Now I'm not one who's 
impressed by displays of physical 
aggression, but if you think girls 
can' t hit, well - think again. 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team showed utter belligerence 
toward the ball as the players 
pummeled their opponents 
in this weekend's tourna-
ment. 

Taking its 
superb record 
into last week-
end's Wyndham 
Invitational at RIMAC 
Arena, UCSD maintained its 
habit of sensational playas it 
knocked off four schools to take 
the tournament in masterful fash-
ion. 

The volleyball team's perfor-
mance was a polished effort, to 
say the least. The team only lost 
one game in four matches, 
defeating Cal State Hayward, 
Emory University, Trinity 
University and the COIIP de grns 
over the College of 51. Benedict in 
the final match Saturday night 15-
13,15-1,15-9. 

"The 3-0 match against St. 
Benedict was the single best three 
games of the tournament," Head 
Coach Duncan McFarland said . 
"Our offense got sharp and 
moved as well as it ever has this 
year. We really saw our potential 
in those games." 

Before 375 screaming fans at 
RIMAC, the women's team gave 
the crowd and its opponent a 
taste of the championship form to 
which McFarland alluded. 

The first game began a little 
shaky just as it had in the first 
game against Trinity earlier on 
Saturday. After an up-and-down 
battle, the Tritons prevailed 15-13. 

Whatever the St. Benedict 
team was thinking. it didn't help 
in the next game as UCSD blew St 
Benedict out 15-1. The third game 
was also a solid win as the Tritons 
won by a score of 15-9 to better 
their record to 18-T and to earn 
first place in the tournament. 

"We were hoping to get a bet-

ter start [in the first game)," 
McFarland said. 

St. Be.edict attacked the 
Triton front line with short serves 
in the opening game, but UCSD 
answered its opponent's tactic in 
the second game with consistent 
passing as part of a· timely offen-
sive surge. Freshman Jessica 
Bartter, who shared ali-tourna-

ment team honors with 
teammates Leslie Punelli 

and Jennie 
Wi Iso n , 
helped to get 
the offense 

going in the second 
game. Jennifer Mclain led 

the team with a .500 hitting per-
centage and Junior Kearney 
Visser, whose presence in the line-
up has been missed recently due 
to illness, had a strong showing 
all around with a .316 percentage, 
10 kills and 12 digs. Furthermore, 
Visser's 10 kills were a team high 
for the match. 

With the final game of the 
tournament in the books, Lesli 
Punelli was awarded the honor of 
tournament MVP for the second 
consecutive season. 

"Punelli was the catalyst for us 
and she played great," McFarland 
said. 

Punelli finished with 8 kills 
and 11 digs, while her ali-tourna-
ment team partner Wilson fin-
ished with 9 kills. Bartter finished 
with 45 assists and 13 digs. 

St. Benedict was led by Carrie 
Otis and all-tournament selection 
Nikki Bauerly with 8 kills each. 

Second-ranked UCSD extend-
ed its winning streak to 16 match-
es and is now 13-0 against 
Division 1/1 competition. 

Another highly billed match 
for UCSD was the match-up 
against Trinity University from 
San Antonio, Texas. This match 
had special significance for UCSD 
outside hitter Allison Bender, 
who had an old friend on the 
other side of the net in the form of 
middle-blocker Alicia Farley, who 
attended Grossmont High with 
Allison in EI Cajon. 

Farley, who became Allison's 
rival on this day, had a 

u.. Huff/GilMhn 
Yo. '- All-American Christine Kueneman (14) sets up a 
teammate in one of the Triton's victories this weekend. 
respectable performance with 11 
kills, but her efforts were to no 
avail as the Tritons defeated 
Trinity 19-17, 15-8, 15-11. 

Trinity College was ranked 
fourth coming into the tourna-
ment with a record of 19-1, and 
UCSD ran into some trouble with 
its top opponent of the tourna-
ment -. the' first game had to go 
to ovutime in order for· the 
Tritons to win. 

"We thought that would be the 
toughest match of the touma-

ment," Mcfarland said. "We got 
off to a slow start in the first 
game. Both teams had several 
opportunities to win games dur-
ing the match, but we came out 
ahead." 

Overall. Mcfarland was very 
pleased with the way his lam per-
formed d~ the tournament. 

-We played a lot of people and 
it was a great team effort, " he said. 

Next up for the Tritons is a 
match on Wednesday against 
United States University. 

Women's Soccer Defeats Worthy Opponents 
KICKIN' IT: With two victories this week over ranked opponents, the Tritons look in prime fonn 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team' sent its competition from 
New York packing its bags for 
home with few fond memories of 
our fine city of San Diego. The 
Tritons followed up this perfor-
mance by squashing Cal 
Lutheran University in the 
biggest match of the season thus 
far. 

The lady Tritons downed 
Nazareth College, from 
Rochester, New York 2-0 at home 
on Thursday after an even first 
half and <l second period of 
inspired pl<lY. 

"After the first 15 minutes [of 
the first half), I thought we domi-
nated them," said UCSD Head 
Coach Brain McManus, who was-
n't h<lppy with his team's play 
early in the match. 

On the scoreless opening peri-

od McManus commented, "We 
\Yatched the game, (instead of 
playing)." 

With a goose egg first half 
behind them and an awakening 
speech from McManus at half 
time, the Tritons' will and desire 
came to the forefront in the sec-
ond frame. 

"We just went at them in 
the second half," 
McManus said. "The 
backfield tight-
ened up and the 
bench never let up 
the tempo." 

With 65 minutes in the 
history books and nothing 
on the scoreboard, UCSD finally 
broke loose. 

The Tritons' Laura Oooly took 
a pass from teammate Elizabeth 
Hughes, booting the ball in for 
her team's first goal. 

"I didn't think it was going 
in," Dooly said of her goal. "It hit 

the post. The post has not been 
our friend. It was a perfect pass 
from [Hughes)." 

The Tritons had a 1-0 advan-
tage, but it was not a comfortable 
one as the Golden Flyers con-
stantly put pressure on the UCSD 
defense. 

"They were tough and really 
quick," Oooly said. "They gave 

us a really KOOd game. That 
first half was shaky. In 

the second half 
we came out 
strong." 

Twenty min-
utes after they snagged 

the lead with Hughes' 
shot, the Tritons extended it to 

one more. 
With the Nazareth defense 

stingy as usual, the Trjtons were 
trying with determination to 
push the ball up the field. 

Christy Abizaid ran the ball 
deep into Golden Flyer territory 

before dishing it off to teammate 
Cindy Dostalek. 

Dostalek accepted the pass 
and found teammate Jessica 
Cordova streaking toward the 
goal. Cordova took the expertly 
dished pas& and shot the ball into 
·the Nazareth net, giving her team 
some breathing room with a 2-0 
lead. 

-It came from a good run by 
Christy, - Cordova said. "Dostalek 
made I great pass. My job wu 
easy." 

Early in the game the two 
squads were playing lr.I a stand 
still. The two very capable teams 
showed just how good they were 
early on, demonstrating smart 
pial':. _ 

Though the Tritons had a c0u-
ple of opportunities to pt'on the 
board, the Nazareth delenae held.
