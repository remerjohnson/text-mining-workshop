Board of Regents convene 
amid budget uncertainty 

Possibility of greater fee hikes discussed 
By USAMAK 

Staff Writer 

In reaction to Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's proposed 2004-
05 budget cuts for the University of 
California, the UC Board of 
Regents stated at its recent meeting 
that it is ready to negotiate with the 
governor and the state legislature 
on a feasible budget plan. 

During the meeting at UC San 
Francisco onJan. 14 and Jan. 15, the 
Regents considered concerns raised 
about the governor's cuts, discussed 

priorities for the next fiscal year and 
designed several possible courses of 
action. These included increasing 
undergraduate fees by more than the 
governor's proposal of 10 percent in 

- order to preserve money for other 
priorities, such as enrollment, facul-
ty and research funding, and out-
reach programs, and shifting more 
financial aid from middle-income to 
lower-income students. 

"The budget cuts over time have 
. -begun chipping away at the quality, 

accessibility, and affordability of the 
university," UC President Robert C. 

UCSD Police low 
on dispatchers 

Station looking to increase 
hiring, alleviat~ shortage 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Since the UCSD police depart-
ment stopped using part-time stu-
dent dispatchers four years ago to 
comply with voluntary standards 
established by the California's 
Peace Officer Standards and 
Training Commission, the depart-
ment has struggled with a shortage 
in its communication center. 

The problem reached a peak 
last month, when a combination of 
vacation, illness and family emer-
gencies forced the department to 
pull a police officer and a sergeant 
out of the field to cover dispatch. 

"That was the ,worst manifesta-
tion of the staffing shortage," said 
Patrick Dobbins, a 1999 UCSD 
graduate who has worked ~ a dis-

Dynes said. "These things are hard 
to regain once they are lost, and 
these things have a direct impact on 
the opportunities we are able to pro-
vide California students and the con-
tributions we're able to make to the 
state's economic growth." 

Under the proposed cuts to the 
UC system, undergraduate student 
fees would increase by 10 percent, 
which would raise tuition to 
$6,028. Fees for nonresident stu-
dents would increase by 20 percent,

Site renamed

Three months after it was shut 
down by UCSD officials concern-
ing the legality of the use of 
"UCSD" in its name, the student-
created Web site formerly known as 
UCSDuncensored.com has 
returned with a new name as ofJan. 
19. Designed by two UCSD stu-
dents to enhance communication 
among UCSD community mem-
bers, the site is official1y relaunch-
ing at http://SDuncmsored.com. 

UCSDuncensored.com, co-
founded by Earl Warren Col1ege 
senior Joe Mahavuthivanij and 
Thurgood Marshall Col1ege junior 
Boaz Gurdin, was launched during 
Welcome Week of fall quarter 
2003. The site featured various 
forums that allowed students ' to 
post messages, comments and ques-
tions regarding UCSD. 

"UCSD needed an online com-
munity in which peers could con-
nect with each other and express 
ideas," Mahavuthivanij said. 

The site also features forums for 
each college and for individual stu-
dent organizations. 

"I think having such a site is a 
superb idea," said Revelle Col1ege 
junior and Revell College

UC prepares bid 
for lab contract 

Regents yet to make 
bid for laboratories official 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

In an effort to retain the con-
tract for the University of 
California's operation of Los 
Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and 
Lawrence Berkeley national labo-
ratories, the UC Board of Regents 
authorized UC Vice President for 
Laboratory Management Robert 
Foley to continue to prepare for 
the bidding process. The Regents 
made it clear at their Jan. 15 meet-
ing that the decision is not a com-
mittment to compete for the con-

tract. 
The Regents have yet to make 

a final decision regarding whether 
or not the University of 
California will compete for the 
contract and will likely wait until 
the , Department of Energy 
requests formal proposals to do 
so. Competitors would have 45 
days from the request for propos-
als to respond.

I BRIEFLY 
Professor of medicine 

Robert Stuart dies at age 41 
Robert aden Stuart II, an assistant professor 

of medicine and director of the San Diego VA 
Chip Core Laboratory, died on Jan. 10 after a 
prolonged battle with cancer. He was 41. 

Stuart grew up in Indianapolis and, in 1985, 
graduated with honors from Indiana Universi~. 
He completed his residency in intemal medI-
cine at Vanderbilt University before specializing 
in kidney disease at Harvard University's 
Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he 
eventually became an instructor. 

In 1999, he left Harvard for UC5D, where he 
helped to spearhead efforts in bioinformatics. 

Stuart collaborated with many faculty at 
UCSD School of Medicine and San Diego 
Supercomputer Center, as well as conducting 
his own research with awards from the National 
Institute of Health and the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. He developed strategies for 
analysis of microarray data, which were fea-
tured in articles he published in such joumals 
as Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sdences, as well as in biotechnology industry 
joumals and newspapers. AIl entire article in 
The Economist was devoted to his research. 

He is survived by many family members, 
including his wife, two young daughters, par-
ents and a grandmother. 

Colleagues at both Harvard and UCSD 
intend to establish lectureships in his honor. 

Lar,le-scale photo 
exhibition comes to UCSD 

An exhibition of fourteen large-scale color 
photographs, "In Finite Spaces: Photographs by 
Doug Hall" will be displayed at the University 
Art Gallery starting Jan. 22. 

Hall will present a lecture on Jan. 3Q at 5 
p.m. in Mandeville Hall, which will be followed 
by a reception for the artist from 5:30 p.m. to 
7 p.m. 

Hall's photographs explore t~e role that ~he 
man-made enVIronment plays In constructmg 
experiences, featuring images of public and 
interior spaces from Brazil, Vietnam, Italy, Japan 
and the United States. 

Hall, who is based in San Francisco, is 
renowned as one of the nation's leading practi-
cioners of large-scale color photography. 

Hall, before turning to photography a 
decade ago, was best known for creating video 
installations. He now travels the world rooking 
at industrial and post-industrial societies.

Academic Senate solidts 
teaching award nominations 

The Academic Senate Committee on 
Distinguished Teaching is. soliciting nominations 
for the 2004 Distinguished Teaching Awards. The 
committee, which is comprised of faculty and stu-
dent representatives, will award a select number 
of faculty and graduate students who have made 
contributions to UCSD as distinguished teachers. 
The committee win consider nominations from 
students and department faculty, and will recom-
mend candidates to the Representative 
Assembly. 

Nominations should include the nominee's 
name, department or program, the course or 
courses for which he or she is being nominat-
ed, and a detailed letter explained the quality of 
the nominee's teaching effectiveness. 

Award recipients win be honored at a recep-
tion in May. 

The deadline for submission of nominations 
is Feb. 27. Additional details conceming the 
nomination process should be obtained from 
the chair or director of the nominee's depart-
ment or program. 

Library Walk now to be 
reserved further in advance 

A new policy requires all student organiza-
tions to make a reservation for information 
table use on Library Walk within two business 
days of the proposed reservation or at least 24 
hours in advance. 

This policy was passed by the University 
Centers Advisory Board on Jan. 12. 

Policy procedures are currently being dis-
tributed to organizations and will be imple:-. 
men ted accordinm. 

The newly dra'lted policy of Li~rary Walk use 
is consistent with past policy, and intended for 
clarification of Library Walk standards. 

The new policy allows University Centers to 
advise Library Walk to use proposals for safety 
precautions. 

Past conflicts with infonnation table booths 
on Library Walk prompted the new policy when 
oversized posters partially blocked the entrance 
of Geisel Library, creating a potential hindrance 
of the fire lane, UCAB officials said.

Regents: Budget raises concerns 
continued from page I 

while graduate student tuition would be 
raised by 40 percent. 

"A 40 percent fee increase for graduate 
students will effectively decimate programs 
like my own, which draws very heavily from 
out-of-stllte students," said Jennifer Loa, a 
first-year biomedical graduate student at 
UCSF. 

The budget cuts would reduce the per-
centage of student fees that go toward finan-
cial aid from 33 percent to 20 percent, 
which would decrease the UC's financial aid 
budget by nearly one-third. 

Funding for outreach programs provided 
by the stllte would be eliminated under the 
proposed budget. According to Student 
Regent Matt Murray, outreach programs 
were largely responsible for small gains in the 
admission rates of minority students to the 
most selective universities in past years. 

"The ouO'each cuts, if enacted, would 
end the efforts to diversify the university 
and return it to a place of exclusivity for 

privileged elites," Murray said. "In the long 
term, ouO'each is the universitys effort to 
ensure than K-12 students, no matter what 
their educational opportunities may be, 
understand and have access of fulfilling the 
requirements to be eligible to attend the 
University of California." 

Freshmen enrollment for fall 2004 would 
be reduced by 10 percent if the proposal is 
passed. As a result, the U niversi ty of 
California will probably enroll 3,200 fewer 
students, instead of enrolling an additional 
5,000 students as planned. 

UC faculty and staff will also be affected 
by the blldget cuts, as salary raises have 
remained at I minimum and the fear of pos-
sible layoffs looms. 

Adam Birch, who works in a UC hospital 
as an administrative assistant and is a single 
parent with two children, said that he is liv-
ing just below the poverty line.

in two years, [and] 1 can't even 
afford to pay the fees for the UC 
system, and 1 work for that sys-
tem." 

Schwarzenegger is also propos-
ing a further 5 percent reduction 
in faculty, which would result in a 
20.7 to I student-faculty ratio. 
The Regents made it clear at the 
meeting that no further reductions 
should be made, and are consider-
ing ways to reduce the ratio to 
about 17.6 to 1'. 

"We are very concerned and 
have made that clear to the 
Department of Finance and 
everybody else we've talked to, 
that it's absolutely vital that if 
we're taking students, we give 
them a quality education," said 
Larry Hershman, UC vice presi-
dent of the budget. 

Hershman acknowledged that 

such cuts were necessary given fis-
cal realities, and that the budget 
proposal could have been worse. 

"The governor finally chose to 
spread the cuts to all areas of the 
budget, not just discretionary pro-
grams .. . if he had not done that, 
this budget would be a lot worse," 
Hershman said. 

However, some were dissatis-
fied with the governor's proposal. 

"Others, in uncertain times 
such as this when they've had a 
financial crisis, described 'sharing 
the pain' as splitting cuts in bud-
gets along with increases in tlxes," 
said Regent Richard C. Blum. "So 
1 don't find this really 'sharing the 
pain.' I think. this is simply 100 per-
cent coming out of the budget. II 

As a result of reduced freshmen 
enro1\ment, Schwarzenegger has 
proposed that students be given the 
option of attending a comnumit), 

co1\ege first while guaranteeing 
admission to a specific UC campus 
after two years. Several regents 
raised concerns with this plan. 

"The smartest kids .. . that are 
not offered direct admission to the 
UC but are deferred to the com-
munity colleges are not going to 
accept," said UC Board of Regents 
Chair John Moores. "So the 
inevitable consequence of this, I 
believe, is that a handful of the 
least competitive [students] are 
going to be the ones who accept ... 
so I'm afraid what's going to hap-
pen is that we'1\ quite possibly 
lower our academic standards." 

The Regents wi1\ vote on a 
final budget in March. 

"We're going to work with the 
governor and the legislature," 
Hershman said. "History has 
taught us that it's better to work 
with them than to go to war."

tition without obligating the uni-
versity to compete," Foley said. 
"This action ensures that UC is in 
the best position to participate in a 
competition, should the Regents 
make a decision to do so." 

The Regents' decision allows 
Dynes to extend the university's 
contracts with the D.O.E., to pro-
vide the D.O.E. with expressions 
of interest and statements of qual-
ification, and to acquire profes-
sional assistance in putting 
together a bid. According to 
Foley, the D.O:E . could request 
proposals at any time. 

The University of Caljfornias 
contract to operate Lawr ence 
Berkeley National Laboratory will 
expire on Jan. 31, while the Los 

Alamos and Lawrence Livermore 
conO'acts are falid through 2005. 

The bidding process comes 
after a probe in January 2003 
found cases of loss or theft of gov-
ernment property and bad busi-
ness practices at the laboratories, 
leading to the resignations of the 
previous UC vice president for 
laboratory management and the 
d irector of the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory. This will be 
the first time that the contract to 
manage the three laboratories will 
be up for bid. 

Since Dynes' appointment as 
UC president, activists from the 
UC Nuclear Free campaign have 
been protesting the university's 
management of the nationallabo-
ratories on the grounds that 

nuclear weapons research, which 
they object to, is conducted at the 
labs. The group has sent Dynes 
one letter protesting the manage-
ment of the laboratories for each 
of the 100 days Dynes has been in 
office. UC students, alumni, stllff 
and faculty have wri tten I etters 
raising concerns about the 
University of California's role in 
nuclear weapons research. 

UC lecrurer Urs Cipolat per-
sonally read the 100th letter to 
Dynes during an open session of 
the Regents' meeting onJan. 15. 

"The University of California 
... has a moral responsibility 
toward current and furure genera-
tions to point out the fatal risles of 
a security policy based on nuclear 
weapons," Cipolat said.

The office of the Co1\ege

office's murals were torn down and

According to

they will fu rther

said pornographic pictures were 
among the materials posted on the 
wall . However, the computer 
equipment in the office was found 
intllct. 

According to crime prevention 
officer AI Jenkins of UCSD Police, 
the incident was not filed as vandal-
ism because the police found no sus-
tUned damages to the office. 

"Somebody had put up posters 
and pictures and red, white and blue 
balloons, SO it just loolcs like a pranlc, 
and technically, there's no crime

decoration and the time spent on 
this, maybe it's saying something 
about how vulnerable our own 
information is .. . but I wouldn't 
expect anything to actually rurn up." 

For Darby, the real concern is on 
how secure the media lounge is. 
According to him, various people 
and organizations have access to the 
offices in the lounge and there have 
been previous occurrences of van-
dalism. 

"We see it as j us~ a harmless 
prank," Darby said. "The only 
thing that concerns us is the fac t 
that the school needs to do some-
thing to secure the area. There are 
always a lot of people going in and 
out."

The All-Campus Commuter Board: ~I LETTERS 
TO THE EDITOR Building a 

comm.uter 
community 

ShMn No/Guortflon I SNO 
Board gives stronger voice to off-campus residents and 
could work to increase sense of connection to campus 

By KELLY GILBERT 
Staff Writer 

While it's not necessarily a 
fl awless plan, the A.S. Council's 
recent a pprovaJ of a charter to 
form an All-Campus Commuter 
Board, an organization that will 
unify the current individual col-
lege commuter councils, is a step 
in the right direction for UCSD's 
commuter students. 

Although theoretically the 
A.S. Council and other student 
organizations are intended to 
serve all students equally, many 
on-campus organizations show a 
definite (albeit unintentional) 
bias against non- resident stu-
dents. Once a student moves off 
campus (which, presumably, save 
for RAs and Regents Scholars, is 
the case for all UCSD students 
once the first twO years of guar-
anteed housing have passed), he 
is suddenly forced to confront a 
different set of issues and needs 
than those of a resident student. 

Currently, most meetings are 
held on various locations on cam-
pus, for example, inconvenienc-
ing off-campus students; many 
activi ties are dorm-related. 
T here are "Muir Resident 
Councils" a nd the like, but fewer 
such organizations for commuter 
students. 

Under such a system, in which 
commuter students do not 
receive benefits equal to those of 
resident students, it is unfair to 
expect that non-resident students 
pay the same fees to Associated 
Students. With over half of 
UCSO's enrollment coming from 
commuter students, it is critical 
that there be a venue for these 
needs to be addressed. Creating a 
commuter-specific board, there-
fore, allows non-residents a 
chance to take advantage of expe-
riences previously only available 
to resident students. 

The new board is a decided 
improvement over the former 
organization, under which each 
college's commuter councils car-
ried little lobbying power com-
pared to larger on-campus orga-
nizations. The new, conglomer-
ated board will give commuters a 
stronger voice simply because of 
its size and representation. 

With the A.S. Council's new 
board, the unified front should be 
more effective in advocating the 
basic needs of commuter stu-
dents . Furthermore, the AlI-
Campus Commuter Board can

ically towa rd

student who relies on parking in 
order to attend classes. 

And simply by virtue of not 
living on campus, students who 
commute can struggle to feel a 
connection both to an individual 
college and to UCSD as a whole, 
as most college activities are 
geared toward students who don't 
have to worry about driving 
home. 

Many commuter students, 
particularly the transfer or fresh-
man students who have never had 
the UCSD residency experience, 
may find it difficult to develop a 
sense of identity and belonging 

to the campus, as 
many relation-
ships are those 
made with dorm-

for example, 
programs that 
don't neces-
sarily meet on 
campus, or

committee made up of students 
who face and thereby understand 
such issues is more likely to make 
the necessary actions than a 
board with resident-related con-
cerns and interests. 

Parking, for instance, is an 
ongoing issue that plagues the 
commuter student. Not only 
does the cost of a permit border 
on the obscene, but the lack of 
availability of parking spaces can 
force students to circle too-full 
lots repeatedly in vain attempts 
to find an empty space, ofren 
missing parts of classes or meet-
ings. And while such an issue may 
seem trivial to a legislative com-
mittee composed primarily of 
residents, it is certainly key for a

hopes that the new board will help 
remedy these issues. 

Under the previous organiza-
tion, not all colleges had their own 
commuter boards, a factor which 
limited any positive impact on 
commuter students campus-wide. 

Furthermore, the formation 
of a new council created specifi-
cally for commuters will give 
commuter students an opportu-
nity to belong and contribute to a 
campus orpnization with which 
they can identify, thus allowing 
them a chance to feel connected 
to UCSD. 

Of course, there's still room 
for improvement. The question 
of funding, for example, may be a 
touchy one, as an appointed, 
rather than elected, group will be 
making monetary decisions. 

However, University Centers 
Advisory Board - an unelected 
body, with members appointed 
by the various college councils -
is charged with oversight of the 
University Centers annual bud-
get, which is twice that of the 
A.S. Council. UCAB allocates 
meeting space in the University 
Centers, and oversees the con-
tracts of the Price Center food 
establishments. Any outcry 
against the commuter board 
would have to be matched with 
equally strong opposition to 
UCAB. UCAB has worked for 
years, so there is no reason to 
believe that the commuter board, 
simply by virtue of it being 
unelected, would be any differ-
ent. 

With the A.S. Council already 
being composed primarily of 
commuters, there will be a fine 
line between equally and overly 
representing commuter students. 
However, the council, like all 
elected bodies, tends to play to 
the constituents it hears. On-
campus residents are the ones to 
whom the council meetings are 
most easily accessible, and there-
fore their voices are most likely 
to be heard. Off-campus resi-
dents cannot always be bothered 
to come back to campus for 
something as mundane as a coun-
cil meeting, and therefore a ded-
icated commuter-interest body is 
needed to represent them. 

Overall, though, the creation 
of the All-Campus Commuter 
Board was an important step in 
creating I deeper sense of com-
munity among UCSD .tudents, 
both those living on campus and 
off. 

No $100 fee for EAP 
students 

Editor: 
Your headline about Education 

Abroad Program on the front page 
. of your Jan. 12 edition had a major 

error about a new $100 fee - there 
is lUI suth fit for studying abroad! 
The article itself is also filled with 
dangerously misleading and inac-
curate information, including most 
of the entire last column at the end 
of page 8. I am concerned that this 
erroneous headline and misinfor-
mation will inhibit students from 
considering study abroad. 

The referenced fee is stricdy a 
government-immigration-service-
related fee, only for international 
students and scholars and has noth-
ing to do with studying abroad. 
Furthermore, at this stage it is only 
"proposed" for internationals, and 
if it goes through, it would be 
imposed before international Stu-
dents even entered the country, 
much less UCSD. 

The database referenced at the 
end of your article did not cost 
$800,000 (more like S6O,000) and 
it, too, is only for international stu-
dents. Todd Tolin, the A.S. 
Commissioner of Acadenlic Affairs 
quoted in the article, contacted me 
to assure me the amount he men-
tioned was misquoted. I regret that 
you didn't verify the information 
he gave you with the International 
Center, which is a primary source. 

Unfortunately, the additional 
key information I sent to your 
reporter about our vast number of 
other non-EAP options was not 
included in the article. 
Opportunities Abroad Program is a 
full alternative to EAP and at least 
as many students go abroad 
through OAP as EAP. 

We created OAP in 1986 to pro-
vide for students who couldn't find 
what they needed on FAP. Last year, 
for example, we sent 32 students to 
Australia on EAP and another 35 on 
OAP. We sent 70 students to Spain 
on EAP and 73 on OAP. We provide 
advising, access to federal and state 
financial aid, special scholarships 
and a special listing of all courses 
completed on OAP. 

There is plenty more on our 
Web site about OAP, if you are 
unfamiliar with it: 
bttp:llorphtus.ucsd.edulicnmrlpaol 
rtIIrttd.html. 

OAP will be there to address 
EAP space limitations this year, as 
always. In fact, many students start 
with OAP ifEAP doesn't have a pro-
gram in a desired institution, such as

Strengthening economy forecasts 
Democrats' doom, Bush's reelection 

By DUmN FIEUCH 
Senior Staff Writer 

The year 2003 showed us 
many things. We saw a war in 
Iraq, a California recall and 
Democratic infighting for who 
will take on President George W. 
Bush in 2004. We also saw i dic-
tator captured, a shuttle disaster 
and learned about a new disease 
called SARS. 

A little closer to home, we 
watched San Diego burn for days. 
Even closer, we saw the disquali-
fication of the UCSD Students 
First! slate for breaking campus 
campaign laws. Yes, 2003 was 
quite a year, even for UCSD pol-
itics. National politics, on the 
other hand, may be disappointing 
to those wishing for a good pres-
idential race this fall . Indeed, 
President Bush won't need to dis-
qualify the Democrats to win eas-
ily in '04 - he's got the Bush 
economy to ride. 

The number-one economic 
indicator: where are the Dems on 
the economy' They're hardly fol-
lowing President Bill Clinton's 
famous axiom, "It's the economy, 
stupid," choosing instead to harp 
about difficulties in Iraq. And 
beca use presidential elections are 
famous for deciding themselves 
on matters economic, Bush seems 
a shoe-in for the White House. 
Democratic silence on the matter 
is reason enough to know the 
economy is on, the rebound, and 
the best economic indicator of all 
can be said to be the inverse of 
the number of times an opposi-
tion party discusses the economy. 

Following a recession that 
began in late 2000 under Clinton, 
the tech-bubble bust of the late 

1990s, 9/11 and a war in Iraq, the 
American economy has started to 
pick itself up as Democrats keep 
tight lips. And we have the Bush 
tax cuts that put money back into 
the hands of spenders to thanlc. 

One Associated Press analyst 
praised the cuts for stimulating a 
sagging economy. 

"Bush's latest round of tax cuts 
triggered a surge in consumer 
spending this summer as the gov-
ernment mailed out millions of 
child tax rebate checks," AP eco-
nomics writer Martin Crutsinger 

" Along with increased 
consumer confidence and 

spending, the Bush 
economy also experienced 

astonishing growth not 
seen since the 1980s." 
conclu~ed on Dec. 23 oflast year. 
"Analysts look for a further boost 
to spending in the first half of 
next year as consumers get fatter 
refund checks, reflecting the cuts 
in individual income tax rates." 

Along with increased con-
sumer confidence and spending, 
the Bush economy also experi-
enced astonishing growth not 
seen since the 1980s. Add to that 
declining unemployment and 
you've got yourself a winning 
economy for a winning president 
in 2004. 

"Th'e Commerce Department

percent in the July-September 
quarter ... the best performance 
since the final three months of 
1983," the same AP article stated. 
And "(t)he jobless rate, which 
peaked at 6.4 percent this sum-
mer, fell to 5.9 percent in 
November." 

Adding to the good news, 
dropping unemployment was the 
result of job gains in previous 
months, the Labor Department 
reported late last year, the gains 
even surprising the department 
itself. 

"Employers boosted payrolls 
by 126,00'0 jobs in October," said 
The Borton Globt of the news last 
November. "All told, the econo-
my has created nearly 300,000 
jobs over the past three months." 

Furthermore, Americans 
claiming unemployment are at 
their lowest numbers in almost 
two years, the Labor Department 
reported on New Year's Eve, 
falling to 339,000 to 6nish out 
2003. 

Along with jobs, the stock 
market also seems to be doing 
well . The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average closed above 10,000 last 
month, the first time it had done 
so since May 2002. And days 
before the new year, the Nasdaq 
index also rose above its holy 
grail of 2,000 for the 6rst time 
since Jan. 15,2002. Additionally, 
the Nasdaq in 2003 posted its 
third best showing ever, rising by 
half through the year. 

Not to be outdone with the 
plethora of current good news 
about the American economy, a 
University of Michjgan team of 
economists predicts that this is

Two-faced users of 
contrasting images 

Returned

Chris Taylor 

Walking by an outdated anti-war poster set up by 
one of the more obscure 

Marxist activIst groups, it was 
hard not to notice the stark con-
trast between the heroes and vil-
lains of the socialist cause. 

On one side of the picture was 
the squinting, yelling face of 
President George W. Bush and 
opposite him the visionary stare of 
the revolutionary Che Guevara. 
Bush's picture was undoubtedly 
chosen carefully for the advertise-
ment, the activists trying to por-
tray the President as being as evil 
as possible, in accordance with 
their chosen ideology. 

It is a common tactic, not par-
ticularly insulting, used by biased 
newspapers and activist groups. 
However, it wasn't Bush's face that 
was so interesting, but rather 
Che's. But even then, it was inter-
esting not because it somehow 
provided a revealing glimpse into 
Che's life and revolution, but 
rather because of its mind numb-
ing repetition. 

As should be obvious to even 
the casual observer of political 
activists, only one picture of Che 
is ever shown, despite the numer-
ous pictures taken of him during 
his shorr life. A plethora of pic-
tures can be found as close by as 
the nearest Internet outlet, but 
oddly enough, activist groups 
rarely use those photos. For any 

number of reasons, Marxists 
refuse to portray Che Guevara in 
any other way than -his one excep-
tionally well-posed picture. 

There is nothing inherently 
wrong with turning Che into an 
icon - other than the problem 
with believing in h.is repeatedly 
disproven philosophy. However, 
the continuous use of this one 
pose exposes activists' hypocrisy. 
These groups which repeatedly 
decry the "government propagan-
da machine" use their chosen 
image to portray vision and 
courage, rather than the brutality 
that Che often embodied. Their 
propaganda is JUSt as evident as 
anything from the government, 
al beit the acti vists are much more 
blatant. 

Marxists have argued that his 
image, dashing and courageous, 
means more than the actual man. 
It is more important to display 
what he stood for in the best pos-
sible means, as an image of hope, 
rather than a true picture of 
Ernesto Guevara Lynch de la 
Serna . This must be the only 
answer, because the man that the 
contemporary Marxists and 
socialists so idolize certainly did 
not propound their idealism as 
much as the propaganda pre-
sumes. 

At the time of his rise to power, 
Che was a much-ne.eded face to 
the propaganda machine of 
Communism, particularly in 
Cuba. Most of the guerrillas were 
relatively homely and certainly 
not visionary-looking. Obviously, 
Fidel Castro did not have eyes to 
dazzle the proletariat. In the halls

Campus needs 
weekend hangouts 
Editor: 
I am writing to express the utter 

outrage that I experienced when I 
came onto campus this past 
Sunday, though I know my words 
will not do it justice. 

I graduated from school last 
year but returlled to UCSD to see 
some friends and catch a little play-
off football on Tv. To my shock 
and bewildennent, no such gather-
ing place was open to accommo-
date my needs. Both Porter's Pub 
and Round Table Pizza were 
closed. 

H the university ever hopes to 
provide an atmosphere that makes 
UCSD more than a commuter 
campus, it needs to do the little 
things like providing places to be 
on the weekends.

Yank: Guevara's lethal tactics draw criticism 
continued from page 5 

Stalin and Mao, the handsome 
young Guevara would take his 
place as a carefully polished image 
of communism. 

As far as his means of obtain-
ing his goals, he was a far cry from 
the peace that the Marxists now 
cry. His actions in Cuba as a mili-
tary commander were universally 
known as unabashedly lethal, 
often shooting defectors without 
pause and conducting mass execu-
tio~ of supporters of the toppled 
Bansta government. 

Perhaps contemporary 
Marxists on university campuses 
feel that lcilling those who dis-
agree with them is admirable, but 
it certainly shouldn't be allowed 
any serious discourse in university 
thought. On the other hand, that 
would explain why the same 
activists preferred to leave 
Saddam Hussein in power, who 
was also well-trained in mass exe-
cutions. 

Even more ironically, many 
historians say that Che's brash 
aggression ruined communism in 
Cuba for many years, due to its 

anarchic, violent state. 
Conveniently, despite economic 
proof, communists blamed the 
U.S., as is done with most all 
other problems in the world. That 

i~, . despite his revolutionary 
VISIOn, he proved by himself that 
such rapid radical change is fool-
hardy at best, and tyrannical at 
worst. 

C~nveniently for the activists, 
Che IS currently and has always 
been a trendy icon among anti-
establishment groupies. Why he is 
still trendy in American universi-
ties where the esrablishment is 

socialis~ is anyone's guess. 
However, it should be noted 

that every t-shirt, poster, banner 
and commercialization of Che's 
image is vainly attempting to jux-
tapose his anarchic communism 
with capitalist materialism. And 
the more frequent the use of this 
image, the less potent his symbol-
ism. 

Then again, it may work to the 
Marxists' advantage, as the con-
stant use of his face and the gen-
eralized statement that he was a 
revolutionary hides his atrocities 

from the harsh light of day. 
Perhaps the true Marxist 

activists are consistent and dis-
tance themselves from every 
impressionable teenager who 
heard that Che was a 'guy who 
hated the establishment,' and 
decided to idolize him. Then 
again, that would only put these 
Marxists into the category of sup-
porting one of the bloodier ideo-
logues of the 20th century. 

In any case, it certainly was 
ironic to study the anti-war 
poster, so full of pride and conde-
scension at the picture of Bush, 
ever-sneering in their minds and 
in their propaganda, always look-
ing for a better, more evil-Ioolcing 
picture of the people they 
despise. All the while, the same 
picture of Che, painfully posed, 
continually reminds us that the 
government is not the only one 
who uses propaganda to deceive 
people.

only the beginning. A November 
2003 press release from the group 
stated that in the next two years 
the American economy will gain 
S.2 million jobs while unemploy-
ment will dip down to 4.8 percent 
in 2005. 

But for all the good news, 
American deficits worry some. 
President Ronald Reagan received 
criticism for deficits run up during 
!Us presidency, and some are jump-
mg on Bush for the same thing. 

However, the nation's number-
one economist seems to think 
deficits aren't the imposing prob-

lem some would make them out to 
be. The key, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan 
believes, is in free trade. 

"Spreading globalization has 
fostered a degree of in ternational 
flexibility that has raised the possi -
bility of a benign resolution to the 
U.S. current account imbalance," 
Greenspan said in a November 
conference. 

And now that Bush has 
repealed such silliness as the near-
ly two-year-old American steel 
tariffs, the real free trade can 
begin - so can the good economy. 

With such a surging economy,

Dispatch: December was 
worst month of shortage

time to manage their work and not 
be constantly under the gun. " 

King has helped lobby for extra 
funding for the two new positions, 
and secured a nearly 20-percent 
raise for the dispatchers. 

Dobbins felt that such a shortage 
could pose sa fety concerns. 

"When there is a shortage of dis-
patchers, that is a hazard," Dobbins 
said. "If someone is breaking into 
your house, and you can hear them 
right now, do you want me to be try-
ing to figure out what I am doing 
here, trying remember how to han-
dle the call or figuring out what 
number to call?" 

What happened in early 
December was a very rare occur-
rence, according to dispatch super-
visor Ron Oshmago and police 
records and communications man-
ager Mary Garcia, who both said 
that the campus was never in dan-
ger. 

"You don't want a trained police 
officer sitting in dispatch; that's not 
what they're trained for, but that 
was an extreme case," Garcia said. 
"If something were to happen that 
needed more field units than we h.td 
at that time, San Diego police are 
really a phone call away." 

The shortage beg3.\! several years 
ago, when the department stopped 
using part-time dispatchers to 
receive P.o.S.T. certification. With 
the recognition, the department 
became eligible for special training 
and r<:l mbursement under the pro-· 
gram. 

However, that left only four dis-
patchers to cover the 24-holir-per-
day, seven-days-per-week position. 
In September 2002, the department 
received funding from the universi -
ty to pay for two more positions; 
which it has been unable to fill since 
then. 

"It was a high enough priority 
for us to go to our vice chancellor 
and ask for the extra funding," said 
Oshmago, who also covers dispatch 
shifts. "We wooJd like more [dis-
patchers). We would like to get 
these twO slots filled - we've been 
trying." 

In attempts to do that, Oshmago 
has organized many recruitment 
effor ts. However, the process of 
testi ng, interviewing, checking 
backgrounds and training recruit-
ments, as mandated by P.O.S.T., has 
meant waiting up to eight months 
for an applicant to become a full dis-
patcher. According to Oshmago, he 
has held six recruitments in the past 
four years, and of those six, only twO 
dispatchers have stayed on. 

"I've had eight dispatcher appli-
cants, at least, fall out of baclc-
grounds or withdraw their applica-
tions," he said. "We 're not the only 
dispatch center that struggles with 
its staffing. Every dispatch center in 
the county, I'd be willing to wager, is 
short-staffed." 

In the meantime, the current dis-
patchers have been asked to work 
overtime hours. 

"Chief King has really gone to 
bat fQl' us," Dobbins said. "When 1 
came on, we were the lowest-paid 
agency in all of San Diego county." 

Even after bringing new dis-
patchers on board, the department 
lost employees to more lucrative job 
offers elsewhere, Oshrnago said. 
Currently, a fifth dispatcher is 
undergoing training and a potential 
sixth is going through background 
and medical screening. 

According to King, the low 
staffing levels is not a problem 
unique to UCSD. However, he said 
the department would maintain its 
tough hiring qualifications. 

"We're not going to accept 
someone who has background prob-
lems, that we can't rely on to do the 
job they need to do," King said. 

Though difficult, he does not 
believe that the current situation 
poses a safety risk to the campus. 

"The big question is, are we 
serving the community ... are stu-
dents safe, is the staff safe, are the 
faculty safe? The answer is yes," 
King said. 

"These things happen, and we 
understand it as dispatchers. It 
makes it tough, though, on us," said 
Dobbins, whose last paycheck 
included 33 hours of overtime. "J 
can't even count on my days off. If I 
want to visit family or something 
like that, I can't, because I can't plan 
on it, and that adds a lot of stress. 
That really lowers the morale." 

Dobbins and Garcia said that the 
dispatchers have not openly protest-
ed the extra hours out of sense of 
obligation to the department. 

"FOr the most part, our dispatch-
ers know why the overtime takes 
place," Garcia said. "It's not so much 
that we say, 'You have to work. I'm 
ordering you to work.' They see the 
schedule, and they know that it has 
to be done." 

Even with the overtime, all but 
one dispatcher took a vacation in 
2003, according to Oshmago. 
. UCSD Police Chief Orville 
King said dealing with the dispatch-
er scarcity has been a personal prior-
ity. I 

"Four can do the job, but we 
don't want to use four," King said. 
"We want to give our dispatchen

an estimated 1 SO users were regis-
tered with the site, which generat-
ed anywhere from 2,200 to 2,300 
hits a day, according to its cre-
ators. 

After prosecution by university 
personnel, Mahavuthivanij and 
Gurin began talking with the A.S. 
Council. By allying with the coun-
cil, the architects of 
UCSDuncensored .com had hopes 
of coming to be regarded as an 
official university-sponsored orga-
nization. 

" UCSDuncen s ored.com 
worked with the A.S. Council for 
several months in hopes of fabri-

eating a parmership contract that 
would include the outlining of 
responsibilities for each organiza-
tion as well as dictated profit shar-
ing from sales of advertisements," 
Mahavuthivanij said. 

The site's creators hoped the 
unification with Associated 
Students would assist in negotia-
tions with the UC Regents to 
keep the controversial name, but 
no legal solution was reached by 
the targeted relaunch date of the 
first week of winter quaner. After 
multiple delays, Mahavuthivanij 
and Gurdin decided not to wait 
any longer and sought to inde-
pendently put the site back 
online. 

"It was extremely difficult to 
get the approval to launch by the 
beginning of winter quarter, espe-
cially with all the bureaucracies," 
Gurin said. "The more important 
issue was having space for a com-
munity online, rather than the 
name - it was a tradeoff." 

Although the A.S. Council and 
SDuncensored.com are not cur-
rently operating under any con-
tract, both parties are still in talks 
and are hopeful about future 
interactions. 

"Associated Students is cur-
rently looking for an independent 
committee to partner with," said 
Jeremy Cogan, A.S. commissioner 

of enterprise operations. "We 
would love to have an official 
online community partnership, 
wi th something similar to Sixth 
College's online forum." 

Cogan said he is currently cir-
culating a proposal for approval of 
the project to A.S. Advisor Paul 
Dewine, Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Carmen Vasquez, 
and Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson. 

Mahavuthivanij said that the 
site creators still hope to fulfill 
their original goals of keeping the 
old name and spreading the word 
around campus of the site's exis-
tence, which the A.S. Council 
could help do by advertising the 
site through student mailboxes, e-
mail or on campus posters. 

With the exception of the 
name change and a redesigned 
logo, all features of the site appear 
as they did before the shutdown; 
former posts, threads, and user 
information are all still intact. 
Three new forums entitled "Guy 
Talk," "Girl Talk," and "Love" 
have been added, and old forums 
included a textbook swap foru m 
still exist. 

Gurin and M ahavuthivanij 
plan to post flyers advertising the 
name change around Library 
Walk and Price Center during the 
beginning of Week 3. 



Over 10 feet tall with a solid black frame, the letters "SAAC," standing for the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, heralds a mural of different mul-
ticultural organizations with a rainbow rib-
bon. A picture of a determined fist pasted on 
the mural catches the eye. Highlighted words 
like "identity," "freedom," "justice," "equali-
ty" and a universal question "What are you?" 
add to its intensity. 

On the o ther side of the wall a vibrant 
painting of pas t revolutionaries demands 
attention upon entrance. The painting 
includes pictures of Malcolm X and Emiliano 
Zapata, among others. 

Inside the Cross-Cultural Center the 
walls are decked with artwork by organiza-
tions and the community, notably a large 
mural that hangs on the wall of the center's 
conference room. Put together by interns 
who work at the center, the quilt-like mural 
represents the many affiliates of the Cross-
Cultural Center. 

"The Cross-Culnlfal interns have been 
dynamic in creating such art programs and 
projects that help connect the community 
together," Cro s-Cultural Center assistant 
director C harlene Martinez said. "You can 
see the representation of how the conununi-
ty is brought together." 

With a ti tle that implies action and the 
crossing of boundaries between groups, the 
Cross-Cultural Center focuses on the inter-
actions of historically underrepresented Stu-
dents and the community. The spirit of mul-
ticulturalism is exemplified at UCSD by the 
Cross-Cultural Center. 

"[Fmr. Chancellor Robert C. Dynes) once 
said that the Cross is the soul of the campus, 
and the idea is that community centers are 
here for exactly that," Cross-Cultural Center 
director Edwina Welch said. "It is here for 
that kind of interaction between students and 

the community." 
The vision of the Cross-Cultural Center 

is to unite a diverse community. It envisions 
UCSD as a university that can "recognize, 
challenge and take pro-active approaches" 
to the diversity of students and of the com-
munity of San Diego, according to its Web 
site. 

"We're a space that's really open to the 
community, and that is our main objective: 
to make others feel welcome," MartiI)!,!z 
said. 

The Cross-Cultural Center's mission is 
as far-reaching as its vision. Foremost, the 
Cross-Cultural Center dedicates itself to 
supporting the needs of UCSD's dlverse 
student, staff and faculty c.ommunities and 
to making everyone feel welcome while 
doing so. In addition to its collaboration 
with sister organizations like the Women 's 
Center and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Association, the Cross-
Cultural Center's priority is to aid in the 
academic, professional and personal devel-
opment of students, staff and faculty mem-
bers of historically underrepresented 
groups. Its main purpose is to provide pro-
grams and a safe space for services that 
enhance multicultural contact. 

The current center was always intended 
as a temporary location and was previously a 
campus mailroom before it established itself 
as an on-campus multicu ltural center. 
Founded in 1995, the Cross-Cultural Center 
took years to formulate itself into the UCSD 
campus community. Since that time, the 
Cross-Cultural Center has grown into a sig-
nificant organization on campus. 

"Things have really taken off," Martinez 
said. "From the beginning, it tripled in the ser-
vices we have for the department and since that 
time, its not only a space for historically 
underrepresented students, but for everyone. "

Center conference room. This mural was painted by graduated students Victor Ochoa and David Avalos.

JANUARY 20. 2004 

In 2007, the CCC will officially make its 
move to a new facility in Price Center, made 
possible by the passing of the Price Center 
and Student Center Expansion Fee 
Referendum la~t spring. 

"We decided that the Price Center is the 
best [location)," Welch said. "We wanted to 
maintain (the Cross-Cultural Center's) visi-
bility, centrality and a homey feel, while try-
ing to keep it inviting to people." 

For this reason, Welch said th3t a new and 
larger facility is welcomed, and choosing the 
Price Center for its move was a good d.eci-
sion for the Centers future. 

Along with the CCC's vision and mission, 
it mainly stands as a "prograttuning entity" 
and a space to hold events for faculty and stu-
dents. 

"It's a safe space for a lot of communities 
on campus. You don't have to worry about 
being ' judged, and a lot of progressive 
groups meet there," said A.S. Vice 
President External Harish Nandagopal, a 
member of the Board of Directors of the 
Coalition of South Asian 
People, which meets at the 
center regularly. 

Martinez noted that the 
Cross-Cultural Center ser-
vices as many as 300 people a 
day, and 41 affiliates of the 
center utilize its space. 
Branch organizations of 
SAAC like Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlan, the African American 
Student Union, and the Asian 
Pacific Student Alliance are 
affiliates of the center, among 
others. 

The upcoming programs 
for this quarter incl ude a 
forum on the issue of college 
admissions, employment and 
affirmative action, sponsored 
by Diversity Peer Educators 
and scheduled for 5 p.m. on 
Jan. 29. Another event features 
guest speaker Huanani Kay-
Trask, a native Hawaiian who 
will discuss Hawaiian sover-
eignty, indigenous human 
rights and global tourism, 
scheduled for March 3 at 7 
p.m. More information on 
upcoming events is posted on

Student leaders and

work at the center learn the ideals of lead-
ership during their stay. 

"It's a great leadership opportunity for 
them and for us because we get different 
ideas," Welch said. "Our mission for every-
one is leadership." 

To the interns, an opportunity to work at 
the Cross-Cultural Center allows them to see 
the importance of a multicultural center in a 
college campus. 

"For me, it's extremely important. A lot of 
people interact in a way they normally 
wouldn't have," T hurgood Marshall College 
junior Cathlene Yapyuco, an intern, said. 
"Common goals and common struggles are 
shared here."

:. ,As a ' prograrnRling in tern, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Amanda Wilson works with acad-
emic departments and other 
offices for community events that 
focus on social awareness and 
<;oalition building, including a 
programming event that is 
planned for a community out-
reach project in City Heights, a 
diverse neighborhood near down-
town San Diego. 

"I think it's extremely impor-
tant for college campuses that want 
to encourage and foster communl-
ty-building and the community 
providing support;" said Wilson, 
who has been an intern since fall 
quarter. 

Wilson is also a member of the 
Hapa club, which meets regularly 
at the Cross-Cultural Center. 
Created to promote multicultural 
awareness, the organization 
focuses on biracial issues, espe-
cially those related to Asian cul-
ture. The word "hapa" is derived 
from the Hawaiian term "hapa 
haole," which is used to describe 

peqple 0.£, Asim and Caucasian 
desCent' · ". ~ 

"T\lere- iI! a collective experi-
ence of beiqi biracial, and a lot of 
our discus.s are based on per-
~ sonal experi;nce," Wilson said. "At 

the Hapa club, we really want to 
focus on being as inclusive as possi-
ble. We try to focus not to be 
Asian-specific, but anyone who 
identifies themself as a mixed 
race." 

According to Welch, most UC 
campuses have multicultural cen-
ters that are similar to the Cross-
Cultural Center, yet UCSD's is 
distinctive in that it works with 
students, facu lty and the commu-
nity. 

Welch emphasized that interac-
. tion between various groups are 

essential to what students learn 
during their college experience. 
The center provides the chance for 
students to learn and receive a 
grasp of the world beyond what 
they learn in lecture, which is 
uncommon at most universities. 

"I always have contended that it 
is so important to be in different 
spaces in a college campus or dif-
ferent venues that you've never 
been in," Welch said. "You need 
that kind of exposure. "

Provost Lytle entertains 
with benefit concert 
By KARLA DeVRIES 

Features Editor 

"1 go for interesting, thought-
provoking, challenging," 
T hurgood Marshall College 
Provost Cecil Lytle said. "People 
don't just go to concerts to tap a 
toe, but to be enriched." 

Lytle, an accomplished pianist, 
has been enriching audiences for 
the last nine years with benefit con-
certs to support the Rebecca 
Elizabeth Lytle Memoria l 
Scholarship Fund. Each year he 
focuses on a specific concept, com-
poser or genre to create a unique 
experience. 

"I don't like the New York style 
of concerts, where you play one 
piece from every period," he said. "I 
play the music of the cracks, the 
thing that don't quite fit into one 
period or style. ft is much more 
interesting. The genetal public only 

know~ about three pieces of classical 
musIc. '1 bey are stuck in the classics 
and never hear the rest." 

ThiS "music of the cracks' 
ranges from avant-garde to 
"wackier" late-Beethoven sonatas. 

"[Franz] Liszt wrote stacks of 
music, probably as tall as I am, and 
you only ever hear about 10 per-
cent of it," Lytle said. "I treat the 
concen as a chance to educate the 
audience and myself. It gives me 
time to think deeply about the 
genre or period." 

This year's concert is titled 
"Hymns," a piano reciw of works by 
Franz Liszt and George Ivanovich 
Gurdjieff and will be held at 3 p.m. 
on Jan. 25 at the Faculty Club. The 
pieces all have religious ovenones 
and are from the 
composers' later 
years. 

"I believe all 
music - rock 
and roll, jazz and 
certainly classi-
cal - is reli-
gious in nature," 
Lytle said. "It 
taps into the 
senses in a spiri-

tua� way. I want-

to the Rebecca Elizabeth Lytle 
Scholarship, which was created in 
1995 as a memorial to Lytles wife. 
The scholarship supports and 
encourages selected freshmen stu-
dents at Marshall college who are 
the fi rst in their family to attend col-
lege. Beginning this year, the schol-
arship will be awarded to a graduate 
of Preuss School who goes on to 
attend Marshall college. 

This imaginative and versatile 
vi rtuoso has been performing 
around the world since 1968. In 
addition to his provost duties, Lytle 
till teaches music history courses 

and performs about 20 to 30 con-
certs a year. He has also been 
actively involved with Preuss 
School since its early development. 

Since the age of five, Lytle has 
pounded the piano keys. His father 
was a janitor, but in the evenings he 
would play Bach chorales on their 
rinky-dink piano and played organ at 
the Baptist Church every Sunday. It 
was there that Lytle first learned his 
an, improvising melodies to accom-
pany the gospel choir. 

"It wasn't so much about getting 
the right notes," Lytle said, "but 
just chiming in with the gospel 
music. As educa ted 3 musician as I 
have become, I hope I never lose 
that instinctive quality." 

Tickets for the concert are $35.

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY. JANUARY 20, 2004 

Basketball: Johnson, Juster lead UCSD Men's basketball: Turnovers 
kill UCSD against UC Davis continued from page ,6 

Against UC Davis, the 
Tritons went up 4-0 in the first 
minute after a pair of buckets 
by junior center Margaret 
Johnson. The lead did not last 
long, as UC Davis was able to 
work well against the UCSD 
zone defense and took a com-
manding lead at 30-15 . UCSD 
dropped out of the zone and 
went to man-to-man coverage, 
and the decision paid off as 
they closed the gap to 30-25. 
But UC Davis finished the half 
strongly and went into the 
locker room up, 41 -27. 

UCSD started the second 
half with a full-court press, and 
soon shortened the the Aggie 
lead to six points. They could 
not manage to pull even with 
UC Davis, however, as they lin-
gered behind them for the rest 
of the game. The Tritons took 
another hit when freshman 
guard Leora Juster fouled out. 
The Tritons had a chance to 
pull within two points, but a 
costly turnover sealed the game 
for the Aggies. 

Both Johnson and junior 
center Stacy Bolton-Gallagher 
had double-doubles for UCSD. 
Johnson had 14 points and 12 
rebounds and Bolton-
Gallagher had 12 points and 14 
rebounds. In addition, the 

continued from page 16 
Rommel Marentez contributed 13 
points and Phil Rasmussen added 12 
points. 
, UCSD outshot UC Davis, 47 per-

cent to 38 percent, but committed 19 
turnovers to II by the Aggies. 

Unfortunately for the Tritons, 
things did not get much better on 
Jan. 17 when UCSD fell to Chico 
State, 85-76. The Tritons came out 
strong and led at the half, 37-35, but 
a Wlidcat flurry at the top of the sec-
ond half doomed the Tritons to a

Swimming: Delurgio is the lone Triton to place first against UCLA 
continued from page 16 

of 1 minute, 4.49 seconds and in the 200 -
yard breastStroke with a time of2 :18.85. 

Although the UCSD swimmers. for the 
most p art, failed to top UCLAS powerhouse 
team, many of them had solid times. In the 
400 individual medley, junior Christine 
Hyjek swam 4:34.07, one of her five best 
times ever, Freshman Susan Bell also came 
close to a personal best in that event, clock-
ing in at 4:37.49, only three tenths of a sec-
ond off her fastest time. 

In the middle of the season, it is difficult 
for swimmers to match their fastest times 
when their muscles are tired and broken 
down from intensive training. Before impor-
tant meets, swimmers usually taper, or grad-
ually ease up on training over a period of sev-
eral weeks. This period of rest enables them 
to swim their fastest times. It is quite a feat 
for a swimmer to come close to a personal 
best without tapering. 

The team's co-captains, senior Carolyn 
Kwok and Hyjek, felt swimming against 
some of the fastest women from Division I 
was a good opportunity for themselves and 
their teammates. Even though they scored 
fewer points against UCLA than they did 
agai nst the University of Utah on Jan. 10, 
Hyjek said, "We performed better this week 
overall than last week. » 

Kwok agreed. 
"I think that swimming against such a 

great team makes us push ourselves to be that 
much better," she said. ' 

After the meet against UCLA. the 
women's dual meet record is 3-4. Although 
UCSD has struggled in its last few meets, all 
of which were against Division I teams, the 
team has performed well against D ivision II 
tearns this season and hopes to win the 
NCAA Championships in May. 

One of UCSD's proven strengths is its 
depth. Often, a team has one or two outstand-
ing swimmers who win aU their races, but no 
solid base of athletes who earn points. UCSD, 
on the other hand, not only has Delurgio, who 
is currently ranked first for NCAAs in both 
breaststroke events, but also a number of 
women who have qualified for NCAAs in mul-
tiple events. 

Among these qualifiers are standout 
swimmers Kwok, Hyjek, freshman Emily 
Harlan and freshman Monica Becks. Kwok, a 
sprinter, has earned automatic qualification 
times in the 50-yard freestyle and the 200-
yard freestyle relay. She also has a considera-
tion qualification in the 100-yard freestyle. 

While Kwok is looking forward to swim-
ming on the relay at the NCAA 
Championships and expects to do best in that 
event, she hopes to swim the 50-yard 
freestyle in under 24 seconds and the 100-
yard freestyle in under 53 seconds. 

This is the first year that Kwok has 
received an automatic qualification in an

16 points. Jessica Campbell had 
17 points and 12 rebounds for 
the Aggies. 

UCSD looked to make up for 
the loss in the next game. In 
their previous weekend games, 
the team was unable to respond 
to a Friday loss with good play 
on Saturday, but this time the 
Tritons followed by playing well 
against Chico State. 

In a first half filled with fouls, 
UCSD and Chico State traded 
baskets for most of the period. 
UCSD pulled away with strong 
play from Juster and Johnson and 
took a commanding 40-28 lead 
into halftime. 

Both teams came out of the 
break with offense on their 
minds. Chico State fought back 
to within four points with 10 
minutes remaining and were later 
able to tie it up with five minutes 
remaining in the game. UCSD 
was too strong down the stretch 

and ended up holding off Chico 
State for the win. The victory 
snapped the Tritons' three-game 
losing streak. 

Late free throws helped the 
Tritons regain the lead, and they 
kept it. The Tritons made more 
free throws in the game than 
Chico State attempted. 

Johnson had an outstanding 
game with 24 points and 16 
rebounds for UCSD. In addi-
tion , Juster added 22 poin tS and 
Ginn put in 13 . Marissa White 
had 21 points for Chico Sta te 
and Michelle Pietka added 17 
points and 7 rebounds. 

UCSD will go on the road for 
their next two games. They will 
play Cal State Stanislaus on Jan. 
23 and Cal State Bakersfield on 
Jan. 24. 

The Tritons will return to

Tritons edged by UC Davis,

By ALAN McBROOM 
Staff Writer 

After losing a tough match 
against California Baptist on Jan .. 
16, the Tritons bounced back to 
upset the University of Southern 
Cal on Jan. 17 in four games. 

At Cal Baptist in Riverside, 
Calif., UCSD came out with a 
strong 30-25 first game. 

The Tritons had game point 
at 29-28 in the second game, 
threatening to open up a daunt-
ing 2;0 lead aga inst a team they 
hadn't beaten in four previous 
attempts away from San Diego. 
However, twO straight points and 
a Triton hitting error evened up 
the match at one game apiece, 
and Cal Baptist didn't look back 
the re t of the match. Final game 
score were 25-30, 31-29, 30-25 
and 30-20. 

Senior opposite Jim Waller 

paced the Tritons with a match-
high 22 kills. He also pitched in 
nine digs and five blocks. The 
two outside hitters, sophomore 
Jeff Urton and junior Adam 
Toren, recorded 12 kills apiece. 
Toren and senior middle blocker 
Andy Rupp joined Waller with 
the match high of five blocks. 
Junior Dickens Tai had a match 
high 12 digs, with junior setter 
Nate Jones contributing 43 
assists . 

The Tritons put the loss 
behind them and prepared for 
their Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation league opener against 
USc. Toren led the way for 
UCSD in the second game of the 
weekend with 21 kills to lead all 
players. Senior middle Kevin 
Keyser had 13 kills and only one 
hitting error, yielding a team lead-
ing .480 percentage. Jones had 57 
assists and Tai had nine digs, both 

match highs. 
UCSD trailed in the first 

game 23-22 before calling a 
timeout. Out of the timeout, the 
Tritons scored the next three 
points and eventually lead 28-25, 
marking the first time either 
team had opened a lead of more 
than two points in the tightly 
contested game. UCSD finished 
off the game with two kills from 
Urton. 

USC seemed to be in control 
of the second game with a 17-13 
advantage. The Tritons, howev-
er, scored five straight points to 
take the lead, four of which came 
off of Waller's serves. The 
Trojans cruised into the third 
game and looked to ' steal the 
momentum from UCSD in the 
fourth , blazing out to a 9-2 lead. 
But again, USC was unable to

Tritons drops two on home floor 
Men's basketball loses three in a row 

By MAn RYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

After winning three consecutive games, the UCSD 
men's basketball team has dropped three in a row, all of 
them at home. Losses to UC Davis and Chico State on 
Jan. 16 and Jan. 17, respectively, spoiled the Tritons' 
homestand. 

On Jan. 16, UCSD played host to UC Davis and lost, 
74-67. The Tritons lost the next night to Chico State, 85-
76. 

In the UC Davis game, UCSD failed to string togeth-
er a rally in the first half. The Aggies were sparked by a 
10-0 run that gave them a lead of24-15. Unable to keep 
up, UCSD trailed 34-22 at the half. 

Early in the second half, the Tritons came out flat 
and were down by 17 points. UCSO, however, did not 
quit; instead, the Tritons cut the lead to four points to a 
score of 66-62 with 55 seconds remaining. This was as 
close as the Tritons would get, because three costly 
turnovers gave the Aggies the opportunity to put the 
game out of reach with four free throws and a steal in 
the remaining time. 

After the game, UCSD head coach Greg Lanthier was 
positive. 

"All we can ask for is to give ourselves a chance at the 
end of games," Lanthier said. "If we are in the game 
every game, then we will win a lot more than we will 
lose." 

Junior forward Brandon Francis led the Tritons with a 
season-high 24 points, making eight of 17 from the field, 
including five from three-point range. Junior center Jesse 
Boyd had 22 points to go with eight rebounds and four 
blocked shots. Redshirt freshman guard Adam Reinking 
collected a team-high 10 rebounds and added eight points. 
Sophomore guard Matthew Sweany tallied nine points 
and two blocked shots for UCSD. 

The Aggies' Fowzi Abdelsamad scored 21 points while
