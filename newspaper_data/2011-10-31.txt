A group of approximately 50 students marched from the entrance of Geisel Library to the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences on Friday, Oct. 28 to protest possible fee increases. 
The protest was prompted by UC President Mark Yudof s visit 
to campus last week. Students are protesting the UC Board of 
Regents potential annual tuition increase of up to 16 percent 
over the next four years, which would ultimately make tuition 
81 percent higher. The projected increase would result in 
tuition fees of up to $22,068 by 2016. �

Yudof, who has held his position since 2008, came to 
UCSD to assist the ongoing search for Chancellor Marye 
Anne Foxs successor. Fox announced her plans to resign at the 
end of the academic year, effective June 2012. 

The protestors  dressed mostly in black  circled the 
Skaggs Building several times before pausing to state demands 
to the UC Board of Regents and the chancellor search 
committee, both of which were meeting inside.

We want to show them while theyre here that we 
completely oppose the 80 percent tuition increases, Associate 
Vice President of External Affairs Samer Naji said. Its 
unacceptable. Higher fees eliminate the potential for lower-
income and minority students to attend university and even 
the middle class is starting to not be able to afford UC schools. 

Students at the protest voiced anger and concern for the 
future of school administration. Several students carried signs

Students and faculty who use the I-5/Genesee exit will soon have a larger bridge and wider roads as a result of the 
I-5/Genesse interchange project. Approved by 
the San Diego Association of Governments on 
Oct. 14, the project will use an initial $56.3 mil-
lion expenditure from the TransNet Fund. The 
final project is expected to cost $94.1 million. 

Director of Physical & Community Planning 
at UCSD Brad Wordick is responsible for the 
creating and implementing the campus plans 
and is the liaison between Cal Trans and UCSD.

Wordick said that the I-5/Genesee expansion 
will help to reduce congestion surrounding the 
UCSD area, hospitals and laboratories. 

It will provide much better circulation 
and access to campus during peak periods, 
Wordick said. 

The project will replace the Genesee Avenue 
bridge with a six-lane structure that will add 
a southbound auxiliary lane to I-5 between 
Genesee and Sorrento Valley Road. The project 
will be up for construction bid by the end of 
2012. Construction will begin in 2013.

The Genesee/I-5 interchange is the first of 
a number of projects aimed at reducing heavy 
congestion in growing San Diego county. �

The entire completed project is expected 
to cost $3.5 billion over 40 years and will be 
funded by the TransNet fund.

The TransNet fund is a voter-approved 
enactment that raised the sales tax in San Diego 
County by one-half cent in 1987. The goal was 
to relieve traffic congestion. A voter-approved 
extension in 2008 is now expected to raise $14

FirstÊHullaballooÊFestivalÊLineupÊandÊDetailsÊRevealed
By Nicole Chan
Associate News Editor

UCSD’s first annual Hullabaloo 
festival will turn Town Square into 
a dance stage and feature perfor-
mances by Felix Cartal, Jokers of the 
Scene and student DJs, DJ Philly and 
DJ Stu.

 The Nov. 18 event will also utilize 
Matthews Quad for rides, a lounge 
area, food trucks, games and booths 
run by student orgs.

Associate Vice President of 

Concerts and Events Oliver Zhang 
attributed the largely electronic 
dance lineup — compared with Fall 
Fest’s typical hip-hop act — as fit to 
current student interests.

“It’s also based on trying to find 
artists with the maximum amount of 
appeal within a limited budget. It was 
an intentional decision and I think 
we did the right thing in doing so,” 
Zhang said. 

The festival will host three car-
nival rides on Matthews Quad. The 
entertainment and amusement rides 

are free for students with valid stu-
dent IDs. 

In addition to the entertainment 
and amusement rides, student orga-
nizations are planned to run interac-
tive booths and games. Zhang esti-
mates that around 15 student organi-
zation booths will be in attendance.  

Five local San Diego food trucks 
— Tabe, Green Truck, Super Q, 
Corner Cupcakes and Flippin Pizza 
— will also be available on site locat-
ed on Matthews Quad near the rides 
and on Rupertus Way near the dance 

stage.
“We tried to identify food trucks 

that weren’t overlapping with each 
other in terms of food and style,” 
Zhang said.

Hullaballoo is being held in Town 
Square in a conjunctive effort with 
Founder’s Day events scheduled to 
take place that afternoon, Zhang 
said.

“[Town Square] should still be 
able to accommodate as many stu-
dents that want to enjoy this event,” 
Zhang said. “It’s a very different 

atmosphere and it should be inter-
esting to see how it plays out for 
students.”

Zhang said the new tradition still 
has room to grow, but added that 
ASCE planners feel confident.

“Having rides, student organiza-
tions a part of it and food trucks — 
this is an event that doesn’t just focus 
on the artists, but still has a musical 
component,” Zhang said.

UCSD SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA

▶The Integrated Healthcare Association has 
recognized the UCSD Health System as a “Top 
Overall Physician Performing Organization” 
for the third year in a row. UCSD also received 
honorable mentions in “Diabetes Care” and 
“IT-Enabled Systemness.” 

▶The Global Information Industry Center at 
UCSD released a report on Oct. 26 that says 
wireless use is growing and if the present trends 
continue, the demand for wireless use will outstrip 
its capacity and cause congestion. The report, 
“Wireless Point of Disconnect,” describes three 
ways to address the problem: key limiting factors, 
traffic management by carriers and investing in 
more infrastructures (such as cell towers).

▶The Explorers Club gave two of its six annual 
awards to Thomas E. Levy and Albert Yu-Min Lin 
from the Calit 2 department at UCSD. Lin was 
recognized for his exploration of the lost tomb 
of Genghis Khan. Levy was recognized for his 
work in Jordan where he connected biblical texts 
and archaeology together to prove that complex 
societies existed during the time period of the Old 
Testament.   

▶A 65-year-old homeless man was attacked by 
a group of 10 boys in Escondido on Thursday, 
Oct. 27. The man was hit in the head and face 
with rocks. His face was sprayed over with spray 
paint. He then was taken to a local hospital for 
treatment.

▶Occupy San Diego’s Facebook event organizer 
Kayla Ward plans to sue San Diego for its police 
department’s methods during a sweep of the 
protestor’s unauthorized campsite on Friday Oct. 
28. Ward said the police used excessive force 
during the sweep. Police are investigating it as 
assault with deadly weapon. Ward is asking others 
to join her in the lawsuit.

▶A woman offered children candy through the 
gate at La Jolla Elementary School on Friday, 
Oct. 28. She handed them a plastic cupcake and 
animal containers filled with sealed candy. The 
woman told them God was inside the containers. 
A teacher confiscated the items immediately, 
prompting the woman to get into her car and yell 
strange noises before driving away.

▶A 21-year-old man from Vallejo got stuck in 
a baby swing for nine hours. He bet his friends 
he could fit into a baby swing and lubricated his 
legs with liquid laundry detergent before placing 
himself into the swing at 9 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 
22. He legs became swollen, and his friends left 
him. A groundskeeper heard him screaming at 6 
a.m. the next morning. He was still attached to the 
swing when firefighters took him to a hospital.

▶On Saturday, Oct. 29, a surfer at Marina State 
Beach was bitten in the neck by a shark. The shark 
also bit a chunk out of the man’s surfboard. Surfers 
at the beach used beach towels as a tourniquet 
for the man’s arm wound. He was then airlifted 
to a hospital. Officials plan to post warning signs 
about dangerous sharks at the beaches in the area.

▶A man in a Smurf costume in Los Angeles 
was shot early Sunday, Oct. 30 while leaving a 
Halloween party. The suspect punched the victim’s 
girlfriend and shot the man when he came to her 
aid. The victim was transported to a local hospital 
in stable condition.



THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 31,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

voicing their concern for their future 
and calling to “Layoff Yudof.”

“We’re angry,” UCSD Public 
Education Committee member Iris 
Loughran said. “We want Yudof to 
know that we care about the selection 
of the new chancellor and we are 
angry about the rising tuition.”

One protester declared unity 
with all protest groups fighting 
for social and economic justice — 
mainly the “Occupy” movement. A 
protest held by the People’s Assembly 
in conjunction with the nationwide 
“Occupy” movement was held a week 
earlier. Other points of interest were 
calls for a reversal of cuts and increases 
as well as equal educational rights for 
undocumented students.

Yudof has previously proposed 
and enacted the 2009 “Project You 
Can” campaign to encourage fund 
raising and increase financial 
assistance for lower-income students. 

He has presided over the UC system 
during several increases, including an 
8 percent increase in Nov. 2010 and 
a 10.5 percent increase this past July.

Additionally, several students from 
UC Riverside drove down for the 
Friday event to show unity with the 
UCSD students. 

“The Board of Regents’ mistakes 
are falling on the backs of students 
and families,” legislative member of 
the UCR Associated Students External 
Affairs Committee David Castillo 
said. “We’re here to show unity and 
that this is not just a problem in San 
Diego, but in Riverside and all across 
the nation.”

Marshall College freshman 
Adriana Ochoa said she was protesting 
because of a personal experience.

“My friend goes to a community 
college because she couldn’t afford 
university and would have been 
overwhelmed by student loans and 
no financial aid,” she said. “I don’t 
consider it fair that she shouldn’t have 

been able to go to a university even 
though she is as intelligent as me [sic].”

Approximately 20 campus police 
officers were on hand to ensure 
security for the chancellor search 
meeting inside the building. 

UCPD Sgt. Doug O’Dell said he 
was not overly concerned about a 
violent confrontation with protesters.

“We’re pretty happy that so far 
everything has been peaceful,” O’Dell 
said. “We never know what to expect 
so we plan for the worst but hope for 
the best.”

UCSD Marketing & 
Communication Assistant Manager 
Christine Clark said the university 
had no response to the demonstration 
other than an affirmation that students 
had the right to protest.

The UC Board of Regents will 
meet Nov. 16 at UCSF to discuss a 
potential 81 percent tuition increase.

$3.5 Billion Project Expected to Take 40 Years

UC Riverside Students Attend Protest in Support of UCSD
▶ PROTEST, from page 1

billion in the next 40 years.  
Since the complete expansion is 

located entirely within the coastal 
zone, it has prompted concern 
by environmentalists as well as 
residents as to the future of the six 
coastal lagoons. 

Gov. Jerry Brown signed Senate 
Bill 468 on Friday Oct. 7, which 
addresses many of the concerns that 
residents have about the 40-year 
construction project.

Proposed by Sen. Christine 
Kehoe (D-San Diego), SB 468 calls 
for completion of mass transit 
projects in conjunction with the 
27-mile freeway expansion.

Kehoe had concerns that the 
project did not focus on transit 

improvements between La Jolla 
Village Drive and Camp Pendleton 
until about 30 years into the project. 

Kehoe asked the Senate 
Transportation Committee to 
call for a hearing last November 
on the proposed expansion. Over 
300 people attended the November 
meeting in Solana Beach. Residents, 
businesses and environmentalists all 
voiced concerns about the size of the 
expansion at the meeting.

“There are better ways to move 
people through coastal communities 
than by only widening freeways,” 
Kehoe said in a prepared statement 
at the November meeting. 

Some attendees raised concerns 
about keeping business flowing 
during construction while improving 

air quality and protecting the coast.
Kehoe drafted SB 468 to require 

Cal Trans and SANDAG to pay for 
improvements to local roads that 
carry traffic from the freeway. 

“This funding must be set aside 
before construction on any freeway 
begins,” Kehoe said.

The bill also addresses the 
ability for drivers to have efficient 
transit options available during the 
40-year construction period. The 
final project will be implemented in 
four 10-year phases, and each phase 
will include a balance of transit, 
rail, highway and environmental 
improvements.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 31,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid is a stressful activity — it can make or break a student’s feasible college choices. But for children of 
same-sex parent households, completing the 106-question 
form can become an extra source of tension — the federal 
government does not recognize the legality of same-sex 
marriage, making it difficult for such families to accurately 
define their situation and receive the appropriate aid.

As a result of this outdated definition, hundreds of thou-
sands of children from same-sex parent households receive 
financial aid that does not correctly portray their situation. 
According to Williams Institute demographer Gary Gates, 
there are nearly 220,000 children under the age of 18 who 
are being raised in single-sex households. The majority of 
these kids, once they reach college age, will have to fill out 
the FAFSA as if their parents are divorced, according to the 
U.S. Department of Education. The parent who makes the 
most income would be classified as the legal guardian — the 
other parent’s income would essentially be ignored. Due to 
this classification, the student’s financial aid would be dra-
matically different than if they could file as part of a married 
family. 

This is a problem that extends beyond single-sex parent 
households. Students with unusual familial circumstances — 
a parent in jail, a messy divorce, several remarriages — also 
face similar challenges with a financial aid form that only 
accounts for the most mainstream of circumstances. And 
because institutions like universities use FAFSA information 
to determine the amount of student aid and scholarships to 
allocate, the factual distortion ends up further hurting stu-
dents. 

This misrepresentation not only leaves students of single-
sex parent households with skewed financial aid, it also 
de-legitimizes their family situations. This form, intended to 
evaluate the financial need of each student in their individu-
al familial situation, ignores the reality of gay parent house-
holds. The federal definition of marriage aside, colleges need 
to have efficient methods of gathering information about 
their students to most effectively give out aid. 

FAFSA effectively dates itself with the evident constraints 
in its form. The Department of State has recently introduced 
gender-neutral language in passports to account for same-
sex parent households. Elmhurst College, a small liberal arts 
college outside of Chicago, became the first college this year 
to ask about a student’s sexuality on their application — an 
optional question, of course. Even the Common Application 
has debated including the question of sexuality. The problem 
is not whether students are forced to out themselves or not 
— it merely gives them a choice. Left without options, same-
sex households are forced to effectively lie about their home 
life and negatively impact the financial aid given.

There are other options. FAFSA does not have to fold 
under the constraints of the federal definition of marriage 
— the Daily Californian suggested substituting Parent One/
Parent Two for the Mother/Father designation given. After 
all, if “legal guardian” is an option, a gender-neutral defini-
tion should also be given. With this narrow view of family 
relations, the FAFSA is hurting itself and the students for 
whom it is designated to provide aid.

I pride myself on being level-head-ed. I rarely raise my voice. I’m not tempted to hurt the people who 
cut me off on I-805. I no longer bat an 
eye at Alexandra Wallace-like exam-
ples of Internet stupidity. And yet, the 
most obvious chink in my armor of 

apathy involves something seemingly 
inconsequential: my Kindle. 

Every time someone makes snide 
comments about how real books are 
much better, I fantasize about how 
hitting said person over the head with 
the combined weight of all the books 
I’ve read on the damn device. (Note: 
I’ve read more than 52 books this 
year; average length: 600 pages.)

I get it. I understand all the rea-
sons to hate e-readers. I miss the sen-
suality of ink and paper: the weight, 
the covers, the carefully chosen typog-
raphy and the feeling of truly owning 
a book. I miss the dream of having a 
personal library filled with hardcov-
ers that serves as a permanent, boldly 
visual declaration of my love of letters. 
I miss the fantasy of meeting my soul-
mate when he’s intrigued by the cover 
of the book I’m reading on the Arriba 
shuttle. Most of all, I miss page num-
bers because citing “location 6879” in 
an essay doesn’t cut it.

It’s true that e-readers are morph-
ing, and maybe killing, the very con-
cept of the book. But I love e-readers 
regardless because of, not in spite of, 
this distinction: I don’t love books, I 
love reading. The Kindle’s business 
technical functionality is democratiz-
ing the spread of ideas — and that has 
always mattered so much more to me 
than fetishizing a sack of pulp.

There’s the old pro arguments 
about how the Kindle allows you 
to carry books everywhere, but 
more important is the link between 
e-books, cheaper price and exposure 
to books that people would never oth-
erwise pick up. Sure, Kindle versions 
of books are cheaper, but the real gem 
is the cache of free pre-1923 books, 
which is something that even the 
library can’t offer. This is a godsend 
for literature majors —  I haven’t paid 
for non-textbook required reading for 
over a year. For everyone else, this is 
a trove of interesting ideas that can be 
kept forever. I’ve spent hours browsing 
Project Gutenburg and manybooks.
net just downloading books on a 
whim. Esoteric Christianity? Sure. The 
Philosophy of Despair? Can’t hurt. I 
don’t need to spend any money. I don’t 
need to return them. Someday, when 
I’m waiting in line at Mandeville, I’ll 
get to these books, and my world will 
be expanded because of it.

Of course, the previous argument 
is valid only if, like me, you have 
always loved reading a little too much 
and believe that every book changes 
you. But the effects of e-readers on the 
publishing industry are widespread, 
even for someone who would never 
download A Pluralistic Universe.  

By spurring the rise of self-
publishing, e-readers are offering the 
tantalizing promise that anyone can 
be a publisher writer — no book deal

Cell phone texting is primarily a manual dis-
traction for drivers. When drivers take their hands 
off the steering wheel to type and send text mes-
sages, they are endangering themselves. Cell phone 
texting makes drivers take their eyes — and their 
minds — off the road. According to the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, after 34 
states instituted laws banning cell phone texting 
while driving, it was observed that the number of 
drivers visibly manipulating hand-held electronic 
devices dropped significantly from 1 percent to 
0.6 percent nationwide. But there is still a long way 
to go. By making drivers keep their hands on the 
steering wheel — and, as a result, making texting 
more efficient — hands-free text messaging will 
decrease the chances of distraction.

Through a Bluetooth connection, Ford’s voice-
activated Sync system will read text messages 
aloud, and drivers will be able to tap a touch screen 
to send one of 15 preset responses such as, “I’m 
on my way.” BMW offers a similar system. GM’s 
OnStar system will transcribe spoken messages 
into text messages. Hands-free texting will be no 
more dangerous, and probably much safer, than 
mobile communications centers — DVD play-
ers, access to Facebook and Twitter, and Global 
Positioning System devices — in many cars today.

Besides, it would be nearly impossible to 
enforce a ban on hands-free text messaging, since 
hands-free phone calls are already legal. There 
will always be potential distractions for drivers 
— whether they are load passengers or the radio 
— but as long as drivers keep their hands on the 
steering wheel, the risk of their eyes and minds 
getting distracted is reduced.

For its 2012 line of vehicles, Ford Motors, BMW and General Motors Corp. have 
added touch-screen texting to its already 
feature-heavy Sync System. Users will have 
their texts read aloud by word-recognition 
software, and be able to respond to them with 
a handful of preset textual responses, like “I’ll 
call you back in a few minutes” and “I’m on 
my way,” all selectable from the main console 
touch screen.

The move has sparked much controversy. 
But the fact of the matter is that Sync touch-
texting probably won’t change the status quo 
very much — widespread implementation of 
such a system is rather unlikely, and in any 
case, its effectiveness boils down to whether 
drivers choose to use the system responsibly or 
abuse it.

Simply in terms of scale, the Sync system 
is unlikely to have a huge impact on car safety 
overall. It is only available for installation 
in Ford, BMW and GM cars. Furthermore, 
Ford doesn’t include Sync standard, and many 
features on the system (including touch-
screen texting) require an additional fee to be 
unlocked. Without a universal implementation 
of this feature, users will likely shrug off the 
extra fee and go ahead at texting and driving, 
the usual way. 

Finally, accident statistics from the Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System and the National 
Automotive Sampling System indicate that 
drivers under 20 are the most likely to be dis-
tracted and involved in fatal crashes — young 
drivers are relatively unlikely to drive new 
cars. 

So it may take years for any benefit (or 
added distraction) the Sync system offers to 
this highly susceptible age group to take full 
effect.

Though states have made many attempts to prevent distracted driving and the seri-
ous dangers it poses, car companies are swiftly 
updating the technology of their vehicles to 
bypass state laws, including the newest addi-
tion of hands-free text messaging. However, 
just because this new technology deems itself 
“hands-free” does not mean that it’s not a dis-
traction nor a threat to the lives of the user and 
others on the road.

We are a society that multitasks endlessly, 
under the belief that we are completely capable 
of handling multiple complex tasks at once, such 
as driving and using our cell phones at the same 
time. But people’s multitasking skills aren’t all 
they’re cracked up to be — psychologists at the 
University of Utah conducted an experiment 
last year in which participants were supposed 
to watch a video of a group of people passing a 
basketball around and count how many times 
the ball was passed. Over 40 percent of partici-
pants never even noticed a bear moonwalk right 
through the center of the group, and all they 
were doing were counting the number of times 
a ball was passed around. While this task is 
simple, driving is not.

Despite the hands-free label, texting and 
cell phone use are still distractions. Again, the 
University of Utah dispels the hands-free-is-
better myth with their findings that using a cell 
phone while driving, whether hand-held or 
hands-free, delays a driver’s reaction as much as 
a BAC of .08 would. According to AAA’s website, 
distracted driving contributes to 8,000 crashes 
every single day, eclipsing the number of those 
caused by drunk driving. If you’re distracted, 
you’re not paying attention to how you drive and 
you’re not watching how others drive. It’s easy to 
miss something you’re not looking for — on a 
busy road, this could be fatal.

needed. The rise of the 99-cent e-book means that almost 
anyone can make some profit, and some can make a lot, 
thus diluting the badge of being a “bestselling” author. 
Laura Miller of Salon has complained that the advent of 
self-publishing means that there’s more drivel out there to 
read. The overabundance of books might make it more dif-
ficult for “legitimate” authors to get book deals, she says.

No one who’s glanced at the list of top-selling Kindle 
authors can dispute this. Look at 26-year-old Amanda 
Hocking, whose self-published series of paranormal 
romance novels has sold over a million copies and earned 
her a cool $2 million. Hocking’s vampire and zombie novels 
aren’t original, and don’t qualify as “literature” as we think 
of it, but they’re selling because there’s a demand outside 
of what publishers believe. They’re selling because people 
want to read them.

Just as blogs have cluttered the Internet with more trash 

than once thought imaginable, but also more niche content 
that appeals to people with every interest, self-publishing 
enabled by e-readers is widening the spectrum of available 
books — even if they’re “trash.” My fellow lit majors might 
shoot me for saying this, but it doesn’t matter if people are 
reading “good books” as long as they’re reading.

The world of books might be getting cluttered with 
more of what Miller calls “crap,” but no one is forcing oth-
ers to read it — not to mention that there’ll always be crit-
ics and the Paris Review to tell the elitists about the next 
Franzen or Eugenides. And even if the next literary darling 
has a more difficult time finding a book deal, she, too, can 
turn to self-publishing.

From rare, beautifully lettered status symbols to mass 
produced pulp novels to today’s pirated PDFs, books 
have always been evolving. But if the Kindle ensures that 
the love of reading is staying the same, even if people 
are eschewing Jane Austen for Pride and Prejudice and 
Zombies, that’s fine with me.

FEDERAL RECOGNITION By Lior Schenk LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
For the last two years, a small 

group of students has tried to estab-
lish an archery team on campus.  In 
theory, this should have been a 
simple task.  

The campus has a good environ-
ment, students interested in trying 
new sports out and most important-
ly, a field to safely practice on.  

The students who have formed 
the club, Triton Archery, are all 
certified national coaches, ranked 
nationally, and have been competing 
actively.  

Yet the group is banned from 
campus.  

The logic presented by the 
Recreation Department was that it 
was unsafe for students to utilize 
“weapons” without adult supervi-
sion, and that it made financial sense 
to force students to take a recreation 
class in order to use the range. 

 In other words, the Rec Class 
happily exploits students for financial 
gain while denying legitimate clubs 
any means of practicing on campus. 
The Recreation department as a 
whole needs to review its policies 
and seriously consider if it is acting 
ethically and reasonably.

Dear Editor,
The previous year UC Berkeley 

admitted only half as many for-
eigners as did UCLA. UC system-
wide admissions reflect a new 
willingness by the UC Board 
of Regents to enroll more high-

paying students from outside the 
state and the country. UC Berkeley 
is offering admission to 17 percent 
fewer California residents than in 
2009 (down from 11,184 to 9,303). 
At the same time, UC Berkeley’s out-
of-state offers for international stu-
dents rose over three years from 743 
to 2022 offers. 

A Chicago newspaper exposed 
the existence of a “clout list” that over 
five years gave hundreds of well-con-
nected students an edge in admis-
sions at the University of Illinois. 
When Governor Blagojevich called 
the chancellor and said, “Admit this 
favored person,” it was not an admis-
sion record kept in someone’s file, 
concluded the Chicago Tribune. 

The American Language Institute 
at San Diego State’s College of 
Extended Studies pays an agency 
15 percent of tuition — or a com-
mission of $299.25 to $897.00 per 
semester — for each student 
recruited to the American Language 
Institute, including five students last 
term, according to SDSU spokes-
woman Gina Jacobs. 

The practice of using commis-
sioned agents to bring in foreign 
students to American colleges and 
universities came under sharp criti-
cism during a recent international-
education conference organized by 
the U.S. State Department.

ItÕsÊHardÊ
toÊFindÊ
Butterflies 
OnÊtheÊWeb

D ating in this day and age is a novel concept. Aside from uncomfortable first date movie scenes, Generation 
Y has little-to-no knowledge or interest 
in legitimate dating. This is by no means 

meant to be a “chivalry is dead” sort of 
rant. Because chivalry isn’t dead; it’s just 
evolved — or may I say devolved — since 
all a guy really has to do to impress the 
average girl these days is actually call her 
when he says he will (sad but true). 

But after going on a few actual 
dates with guys I had chatted with on 
OkCupid, I realized that online dat-
ing pretty much sucked out all the little 
things I found fun about dating.

We’ve all heard someone (or even 
ourselves) say “the chase is half the fun.” 
Just because it’s trite doesn’t mean it’s not 
true, and I’m starting to think the cliche 
actually has more to offer than I once 
thought. The anticipation of having a 
guy flirt with you, waiting for him to text 
you and everything else that leads up to 
the actual date (be it a friend request or 
flowers sent to your doorstep) is some-
thing that online dating readily lacks (in 
addition to a good meet-cute to recount 
at parties). 

Now whether the dates I’ve been on 
have been enjoyable or not is somewhat 
irrelevant at this point (they’ve all been 
consistently okay — no horror stories 
yet), but that’s because so far they’ve all 
been kind of the same. True, each guy 
had a different major, a different home-
town and ordered a different kind of 
coffee, but each date followed the same 
general format. 

Besides having a slightly ulterior 
motive (cough — this column), all cards 
were pretty much laid right out on the 
coffee table that sat between my date and 
myself. Intentions were made clear and 
that was that. There’s no mystery. No 
poker face and definitely no butterflies.

Maybe this is indicative of the guys 
I’ve met (one of whom found out about 
this column, which may have made him 
feel more on the spot than I would have 
intended — sorry dude) but for the most 
part the methodical and interview-like 
format of these dates turned me off 
regardless of the suitor himself. Now if 
I were forty-something looking to settle 
down, online dating would be a great 
resource. It’s easy, efficient and almost 
guarantees you a handful of dates. But 
I’m looking for someone to make my 
heart race, not make my biological clock 
tick.  

I’ve been involved with my fair share 
of douche bags and I’ll readily admit that 
I’d take boring over the guy who texted 
me “this is the message you’ve been wait-
ing for for the past three days” without 
a doubt. But even that guy — the guy 
who inevitably forced me to raise my 
standards — got me more excited than 
any guy I could have met online simply 
because he was unpredictable, a factor 
that is inherently removed from online 
dating. 

But even though I have a few gripes 
about the process itself, I’ll continue to 
give this whole thing a shot, though I 
might have to get through a quick rom-
com sesh of “Love Actually” first, in order 
to reinstate the lingering romantic senti-
ment I’ve lost.

The Spy Who 
Baked Me

Recent UCSD grad shakes 
up his mother’s chocolate 
chip cookie recipe with a 
secretive delivery method.

By Margaret Yau • 
Managing Editor

T he Secret Cookie Service may not be the first company to tap into the college late-night munchie market, but few match their junk food deliveries in terms of flair. The owner is a recent UCSD graduate with a masters degree 
in chemistry who, in a suited-up, sunglasses-on meeting 
with the Guardian, asked to remain anonymous. The 
pseudonym “Agent X” will have to do.

The concept is simple: The Secret Cookie Service 
delivers freshly baked cookies anywhere on campus 
between the hours of 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. And forget the 
dejected, polo-clad delivery boys of pizza runs past — 
X hand-delivers each order in a suit and sunglasses. 
Cookies arrive in his accompanying $4 attaché, a recent 
acquisition from the Salvation Army. 

Orders can be placed via email (preferably before 
delivery hours), text message or over a voicemail 
designed to sound like James Bond. The enterprise has 
also begun to accept credit and debit cards, sparking a 
newfound interest among parents who want to send their 
babies a rather unique care package.

It all started when X graduated last spring. Job pros-
pects looked grim, so he turned to a tried-and-true suc-
cess — his mother’s famous chocolate chip cookie recipe. 
Planning began a month before the 2011-12 year kicked 
off, and after a cookie-and-business-card giveaway dur-
ing Week One, the Secret Cookie Service was up and 
running. Now, five short weeks later, the business has 
more than 1,000 likes on Facebook — no doubt due to its 

ingenious marketing strategies.
Among the many promotions: Wearing their custom-

ized sunglasses at the drop point (the delivery zone) will 
give you two complimentary cookies. So will liking them 
on Facebook. Their marketing strategy focuses solely on 
social media websites and word of mouth — one of the 
biggest unforeseen successes came from their first few 
customers, who eagerly took pictures of the delivery and 
posted them up on Facebook. 

But X didn’t expect the business to take off so quickly.
“Week One on Saturday, I was out watching 

‘Moneyball’ with a friend, and I couldn’t believe it — 
11:30 at night, I didn’t think anybody would order the 
first weekend, and I started getting phone calls,” he said. 
“‘I want four cookies. I live in Sixth College.’ It was hilari-
ous — I ran out of the movie theatre, ran home, put on 
the Superman suit.”     

As for the cookies themselves: X’s mama didn’t lie 
— they’re good. The main flavor is chocolate chip, but 
X busts out variations studded with M&M’s and Reese’s 
Pieces. And each cookie has enough bite and buttery 
excess to keep munchies at bay for weeks. They’re soft 
cookies — more like underbaked dough than Chips 
Ahoy crunch. 

It may seem like all fun and food, but Agent X’s 
workday is exhausting. After all, he only has a couple of 
friends helping him out, and he does almost all of the

deliveries himself. Each day begins at 9 
a.m. with groceries and 50-pound bags 
of flour. And from noon till 6 p.m., it’s 
six straight hours of baking, and then 
straight into deliveries from 7 p.m. to 
2 a.m. A good day brings in around 
30 orders, and Agent X goes out of his 
way for everybody — even if an order 
is placed at 1:55 a.m. For X, it’s about 
accountability.

“As much as all of this is funny, 
and we have a lot of fun doing it — we 
really take it seriously,” he said. 

The company is rapidly growing, 
and X hopes to expand even more 
Winter Quarter. In addition to a brand 
new website, they also hope to start 
hiring undergraduates to make deliv-
eries. They will screen their potential 
employees for a sparkling personality 
— or at least, someone who can keep 
their cool amid drunken harassment 
on late night runs. 

In the future, X hopes to sponsor 
athletic events or do large orders for 
campus organizations. Next week, he 
plans to make his first donation. Camp 
Kesem, a charity that works with chil-
dren of cancer patients, will receive the 
majority of profits and donations from 
a night of cookie deliveries. 

X’s main goal is to open up a 
permanent shop somewhere on- or 

off-campus that could act as a base of 
operations for deliveries. Right now, 
each delivery is driven from the cookie 
headquarters in an undisclosed loca-
tion. But according to X, the house is 
close to campus. Off-campus students 
need not feel left out — X also delivers 
in the general area surrounding UCSD, 
but he was rather cryptic about the 
boundaries. 

Physical location aside, X just wants 
to make work fun.

“My goal is to create a workplace 
that is a creative, vibrant place, where 
people are excited to go to work,” he 
said.

San Diego Velodrome 
Association ‘VeloSwap’ 
Bicycle Swap Meet

N ext Sunday, Nov. 6 the San Diego Velodrome Association will hold its semi-annual VeloSwap, SoCal’s larg-
est bicycle swap meet. With everything from 
standard, everyday bikes for transporting 
students across campus to competitive sport 
bikes ideal for triathlons, it’s a good place to 
pick up some new wheels. And it ain’t just 
bikes either; The infield of the San Diego 
Velodrome’s 333.3 meter track (located at 
Morley Field in the recreation area of Balboa 
Park) will be lined with boxes and tables of 
wheels, tires, chains and handlebars — just 
about every bicycle part imaginable — as well 
as cycling gear and accessories.

Gates open to buyers at 9 a.m., who have 
to shell out a $5 entry fee to access some of 
the greatest bargains in the bicycle world. 
Come prepared with cash but leave your 
bicycles behind, as bikes aren’t allowed into 
the venue with buyers — though there will be 
a free bike valet outside the gate. 

The event is also looking for sellers — 
those looking to free their hands of some old 
bikes or unused parts that have only been 
collecting dust. Walk-in sellers will be charged 
$15 per person and let in at 8:15 a.m., while 
drive-ins will be let in beforehand at 7 a.m. 
and charged $80 for two people and $15 per 
extra person. Also, if you’re feeling charitable, 
the International Relief Coalition and the 
Bike Kitchen will be collecting donations for 
unwanted bikes and parts.

But be prepared to side-step every other 
fixed gear-toting hipster in town; over 200 vendors and 2,000 buyers are 
expected at the semi-annual event, which won’t be held again until the spring.

To get into the Fremont Hills Country Club, my grandparents had to buy a membership, an opportunity limited 
only to a select few. Here at UCSD, our ath-
letes have SAT scores more than 100 points 
higher in math and reading than any other 
school in the CCAA. We also do not offer 
scholarships, at least not ones that actu-
ally pay for your education, housing or even 
books for one quarter. 

If you want to play here, you must 
be one of a select few with the grades to 
be offered a spot, and the means to pay 

for membership in our country club. 
       It makes sense then that the sports UCSD 
excels in and the athletes we attract come 
from the country club.
     Swimming, baseball, golf, track & field and 
tennis are all sports Tritons historically domi-
nate in the CCAA, while we receive that swift 
kick in the rear in basketball and soccer — 
correction, men’s basketball and men’s soccer.

No sport is free, but inequalities among 
price tags are obvious. The “country club” 
sports — baseball, swimming & diving, fenc-
ing, tennis, golf — all require large sums 
of money and time compared to sports like 
basketball and soccer. For instance, a nice 
baseball bat will set you back up to $400, plus 
a nice glove for another $100 or more, plus 
bags, cleats and balls. For soccer or basket-
ball, you need a $10 ball and a court or field 
(or dirt patch or alley way). 

In short, we get the athletes who can pay 
to play their expensive sports.

The difference is that in men’s basketball 
and soccer, you can get good without money. 
This is why much cheaper state schools, 
which offer substantial scholarships (at least 
in the CCAA) are drawing the best players, 
leaving us with only those who can both 
afford to pay for a UC and get admitted to the 
school on grades alone. 

All of this can be seen in UCSD’s statis-
tics — we have higher SAT scores and higher 
U.S. News and World ranking than any other 
CCAA school.

I say men’s basketball and soccer because 
the demographics of the NCAA women’s 
sports are drastically different than their male 
counterparts.

For women, I think it can be said that the 
pool of collegiate athletes is smaller, and so 
there is more emphasis on exclusive, expen-
sive club teams in the Olympic Development 
Program for soccer and AAU teams for bas-
ketball. These are the athletes UCSD brings 
in.

If my theory is correct, we should see the 
sports with a lower economic cost competing 
at a lower level at UCSD than those sports 
that require a higher level of monetary com-
mitment.

Men’s basketball has only had three win-
ning seasons since our move to Division II in 
2001, while the women’s team has had nine 
winning seasons in the same span. 

The same can be seen with soccer. In 2001, 
the women’s soccer team won the National 
Championship and has had a winning record 
every year since, as well as a handful of CCAA 
Championship titles while the men’s team has 
not garnered a title.

This disparity between men’s and women’s 
athletics begs the question: Why is there such 
a gap in the level of success? 

Other than the socio-economic factor, 
grades are also a big part of male vs. female 
athletics. For men, there is a larger com-
petitive pool from which to draw, driving the 
price way down relative to women’s sports.      
This large demand for men’s sports explains 
the subsequent relative cheapness when com-
pared to the same sport for women. The high 
cost of a female sport makes for even fewer 
female athletes with the time and resources to 
become competitive. 

The few athletes who can do well in 
school while also doing well in their sport 

become the only athletes UCSD can attract. 
But this is a trend seen throughout collegiate 
athletics. In a study conducted by “the sport 
journal” analyzing the aggregate grade point 
averages of both men’s and women’s teams at 
a small Division II university, in all of their 
nine sports, the female athletes outperformed 
their male counterparts. For whatever reason, 
female athletes outperform men in the class-
room. And taking into account UCSD’s high 
academic threshold, the male athletic pool 
from which UCSD can pick from gets drasti-
cally diminished.

Thus we come to the fact that, on average, 
our women’s teams are able to recruit good 
female athletes that not only kick ass on the 
field, but can get good grades in the class-
room as well. Men on the other hand, can 

get away with playing on a higher level while 
sacrificing their athletic achievement, leading 
to fewer male athletes with good grades.

We’re making rather large assumptions 
here, but in sum 1.) You need good grades to 
get into UCSD. 2.) Because female athletes 
on average get better grades, more competi-
tive female athletes want to come to UCSD in 
comparison to the men. 3.) This inequity is 
due in part to our absence of athletic scholar-
ships, taking away the pay to play mentality 
that all athletes must overcome at UCSD. 
4.) This leads to a deterring of top-tier male 
athletes with poor grades, while an average 
female with good grades will be more likely 
to receive and accept an academic scholar-
ship to play at UCSD.

Your future never looked brighter.

thanks largely to the efforts of Condon and 
Freidenberg. 

During the rest of the second game, the 
Warriors simply outplayed UCSD, beating 
the Tritons 25-20.

Kills from Katie Condon and Roxanne 
Brunsting combined with blocks by Demos 
and Brunsting pushed the Tritons through 
the third game 11-25. 

Their intensity carried over into the 
fourth game where once again the Tritons 
forced nine errors and combined for a solid 
12 kills — not even letting the Warriors have 
a look at the lead. 

There were no lead changes, and no tie 
scores as the Tritons buried the Warriors 
25-15.

Into the deciding match, the Tritons bur-
ied the Wildcats rolling to a 3-2 victory.

Outside Hitter Roxanne Brunsting played 
one of her best games of the season with an 
incomparable 23 assists, 13 kills and 19 digs. 
Hillary Williamson also put up some impres-
sive numbers with 12 kills and 13 digs. Setter 
Amber Hawthorne put up a match high of 
31 assists with 13 digs, while senior outside 
hitter Katie Condon had a spectacular match 
high of 17 kills and 22 digs to complete yet 
another double-double performance. 

Next Friday, UCSD faces Sonoma State, 
who sits in second place in the CCAA and 
has a 16-2 overall record. The last time 
the two teams met, UCSD conceded a 3-1 
loss. The Tritons will compete against the 
Seawolves as they wrap up their regular 
season.

Women’s Volleyball 
Takes Back-to-
Back Wins

MEN’S WATER POLO--   The No. 11 
UCSD Men’s Water Polo team faced off 
against WWPA rivals No. 12 UC Davis on 
Friday, Oct. 28. With the win, the Tritons 
improved to 11-3 in WWPA and 13-7 overall. 
       Breaking a four-game losing streak 
last week with a win against unranked 
Occidental last Saturday, Oct. 22., 
the Tritons defeated UC Davis 10-6. 
       The two teams, who have identi-
cal WWPA records, retired after the 
first period with the score drawn 3-3. 
       Davis’ Walter Eggert netted two goals for 
the Aggies, while the Tritons saw scoring 
from junior utility Jon Butler, senior captain 
Graham Saber and sophomore Josh Stiling. 
    The sophomore would tack on two more goals 
in the second period. Stiling’s hat trick gave 
UCSD the 6-4 advantage with 2:47 left in the half. 
    The Tritons held onto the lead into halftime, 
but the Aggies cut the deficit by one in the third 
quarter on a goal by Trevor Allen. But UCSD 
kept in front of the Aggies with a big goal 
from junior utility Brian Donohoe just before 
the end of the period, putting the score at 6-8. 
       The Tritons showed tough defensively, 
with goalkeeper David Morton registering 
a remarkable 10 saves on the night, com-
pared to Davis keeper Kevin Peat’s four saves. 
       “Everyone really played well offensively 
and defensively,” Morton said in an inter-
view with UCSD athletics representatives 
after the game. “It was a whole team effort.” 
       Into the last period, the Aggies were 
unable to crack the Triton defense, as UCSD 
outscored UC Davis 2-0, with goals from 
Saber and freshman Matthew Michalko. 
    “The win was huge,” Morton said. “I know after 
last week after we lost to [Loyola Marymount] 
we were really bummed, and tonight was real-
ly important to us to clench the No. 2 seed.”  

       With their No. 11 ranking still intact and 
just three more matches before the end of the 
regular season, the Tritons will look to pre-
pare for the postseason. UCSD will have two 
more home matches. 
   On Friday, Nov. 4, the Tritons will host Santa 
Clara and on Sunday, Nov. 6, they will face off 

against UCLA. 
     Against the Bruins, the Tritons will honor 
their four graduating seniors: William Brown, 
Matt Kerchner, Morton and Saber.

The UCSD Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving teams began the new season by sweeping Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, as 17 different Tritons won their individual races.
In last year’s tremendous 2010 season, UCSD’s men took second at 

the NCAA National Championships while the women’s team took third. 
       UCSD returned to the pool last weekend, Oct. 24 for its annual 
Blue vs. Gold meet, clocking quick times typical of its swimming and 
diving program.

On Saturday, Oct. 29 the Tritons took command of the field 
against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, a Division III team that competes 
in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 

Although the swimming and diving teams saw a minor change 
in management — the Tritons are now coached by former assis-
tant coaches Corrie Falcon and Matt Macedo, who replaced Scott 
McGihon. UCSD’s top swimmers, seniors Matt Herman and Alex 
Henley, are still in the roster.

Herman was the 2011 national champion in the 1000- and 1650-
yard freestyle events, and All-American Henley is a three-time 

NCAA national title holder. 
The two demolished the field on Saturday.
Henley won three events on Saturday, taking the 200-yard free-

style with a time of 1:55.73, the 200-yard fly with a time of 2:05.78 
and the 200-yard backstroke in 2:05.77.

Herman won the 1000-yard freestyle in 9:35.58.
The Tritons also displayed a number of young Tritons, who also 

faired well in the meet. Sophomore Alex Merrill finished first in the 
100 free with a time of 47.33, as well as in the 200 free in 1:43.01. 
Sophomore Nick Korth, who won three individual events in the Blue 
vs. Gold meet, took first in the 100 breaststroke. 

Freshman Jessica Norgard finished the 1000 free in 10:38.81 and 
freshman Dane Stassi finished first in the 200 fly with a time of 
1:48.97 for the men.

Collectively, the UCSD men’s team beat the Stags by a score of 177 
to 111, while the women beat the Athenas 175 to 112.

The Tritons’ next meet is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 4, at UCSB. 
The meet will be a tough test for UCSD, as nine Gauchos have quali-
fied for the 2012 Olympic Trials.

Tritons Sink 
Opposition 

By Nash Howe
Contributing Writer

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL-- The Triton 
women’s volleyball team headed North 
on Friday, seeking retribution for their 
upset loss to Chico last month. UCSD’s 
preparation was well rewarded: A 3-1 
victory over Chico bumped the Triton’s to 
16-4 in the CCAA. After narrowly giving 
up the first game, UCSD was unyielding 
in the final three sets, coming back to fin-
ish off the Wildcats in their sixth straight 
victory. 

The first game was tight as the Tritons 
and Wildcats traded leads with a grand 
total of 13 tie scores and eight lead 
changes, and the Wildcats out-killed the 
Tritons 13-12. Down 23-21 late in the 
first game, UCSD used their second time-
out in an attempt to gather themselves, 
but couldn’t come up in the clutch to get 
the win, falling to Chico 22-25.

In the second game, UCSD forced 
10 Wildcat errors and gave up only 
16 points. Senior outside hitter Katie 
Condon led the Tritons with three huge 
tempo setting kills. 

And UCSD took the momentum into 
the third game, outplaying the Wildcats 
to hold the lead throughout the entire set. 
UCSD recorded 15 kills and only 2 errors 
in the set, which put them ahead 2-1. 

The final game echoed the inten-

sity of the second game, and UCSD came 
out even harder, starting with a service 
ace from senior Janessa Werhane. UCSD 
struggled, recording several errors in the 
final game, but didn’t let that dampen 
their motivation to finish 
off Chico. Kills by Wilroy, 
Condon, and Brunsting put 
UCSD ahead for good, tak-
ing the win from the CCAA 
rival 25-17 in the final game. 

UCSD displayed their 
depth in this vital confer-
ence victory with a number 
of Tritons recording impres-
sive stats across the board. 
Four Tritons posted double-
doubles: Senior Roxanne 
Brunsting had 25 assists 
with 10 digs, freshman setter 
Amber Hawthorne picked 
up 15 assists with 10 digs, 
senior Hillary Williamson 
went for 12 kills and 16 digs and Condon 
came through with a match high with 14 
kills and 10 digs. Senior middle blocker 
Julia Freidenberg had a great game as 
well with 10 kills and 2 blocks. 

Coming off a revitalizing victory, the 
Tritons nearly failed to re-focus as they 
geared up to face ninth ranked Cal State 
Stanislaus on Saturday.

“I thought that we really played 
well against [Stanislaus],” head coach 

Ricci Luyties said. “We knew that this 
was a really important game, because 
they’re right behind us in the [CCAA 
standings]...I think our level of inten-
sity was right where it should be and I 

thought all of our matches 
progressing after the first 
two we played really well.”

Like with Chico, the 
Tritons fought mercilessly 
to stay with Stanislaus, 
accumulating five errors 
and fifteen kills. UCSD ral-
lied to take the first game 
with 16 kills and only four 
errors. 

Uncharacter ist ica l ly, 
the Tritons gave up eight 
consecutive points in the 
came into the second game 
giving up eight consecutive 
points in the first game, 
largely due to errors, as the 

Warriors swiftly stretched the lead to 8-1. 
“We really were not playing well at 

all,” Luyties said. “That’s not taking any-
thing away from Stanislaus. We made so 
many errors. We progressed really well 
against Chico, but we took a big step back 
against Stanislaus.”

After a timeout by UCSD, the Tritons 
rallied to cut the deficit to three, and 
slowly crept their way to tie it at 11
