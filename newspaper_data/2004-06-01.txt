Talks for Co ... op lease 
renewal break down 
Co-oRs' lawyer asks for 

informal dispute~ resolution 
By MAINmE FlDEIIS 

Associate News Editor 

Negotiations to renew the 
Master pace Agreement, the con-
tract lea ing out univer ity co-op 
paces to As ociated tudents and 

the Graduate Student AsSOCIation, 
have tailed. 

The co-op~, through a legal 
representative, requested to go into 
an informal dispute resolution dur-
ing a May 28 meeting of the Co-op 
Oversight Committee. The letter, 
addre ed to University Centers 
Advisory Board Co-Chair Carmen 
Vazquez, claims that the university 
is in breach of the existing agree-
ment. 

Since April, the co-ops have 
been in the process of renewing 
the agreement with the university. 
However, University Centers sub-

mitted changes to the agreement 
on April 23 stating that it would 
{lot renew the agreement in its 
current form unless the changes 
were made. Since then, the co-ops 
have been operating under the 
current MS~ on a month-to-
month basis. 

According to the letter sent to 
Vazquez by the Law Offices of 
Lottie Cohen, the Memorandum 
of Understanding - the document 
that explains the leasing relation-
ship between the co-ops and the 
university - grants only the A.S. 
Council and the GSA the powers to 
renew the agreement. According to 
the memoranJ"um, the univer ity 
lease spaces to Associated Students 
and the GSA, who in turn can sub-
lease to the co-ops, which include

Preuss to graduate first class 
All 55 high school seniors to attend college 

By SHANNON EUm 
Staff Writer 

In less than a month the first 
senior class at Preus School is 
scheduled to graduate. All 55 
members have been accepted to 
college and will be continuing 
their education at either junior 
colleges or four-year universities. 

Preus chool, located on the 
UCSD campus, is a public char-
ter school for students in grades 
six through 12. The school 
enrolls students from low-
income backgrounds who are 
historically underrepre ented at 
UC campuses and who will be 
the first in their families to 
attend college. 

Come fall 2004, 10 Preuss stu-
dents will be attending private 
schools and 23 will be attending a 
UC campu . Nineteen of those

UCSD Physical Planning 
released its 2004 Long Range 
Development Plan outlining the 
physical growth and development 
of the campus through the 2020-
21 academic year on May 26. An 
accompanying Draft Environment 
Impact Report assessing the envi-
ronmental effects of the LRDP 
was also released on the same date. 

The UC Board of Regents 
approved the first LRDP for 
UCSD in 1963, with subsequent 
revisions in 1966, 1981 and 1989. 

According to Vice Chancellor 
for Resource Management and 
Planning John Woods, the pur-
pose of the newest version of the 
LRDP is to update the universi-

ty's long-range development 
plans in light of demographic and 
educational changes. 

"In updating our long-term 
blueprint for future growth, we 
are refining our land use objec-
tives in a manner that is consis-
tent with our founder's vision, and 
we believe this plan will sustain 
UCSD's position as a world-
renowned center for higher learn-
ing, research, medical and com-
munity facilities," Woods said in a 
May 26 statement. . 

The 2004 LRDP projects a 
student population of approxi-
mately 29,900 in the 2020-21 
academic year, including about

La Jolla beaches eam Ifs 

on annual report card 
Eight La Jolla beaches received high marks 

on the Annual Beach Report Card issued by 
Heal the Bay, a Southern California environ-
mental group. 

Six of the area's beaches studied by the 
organization earned A grades for low measure-
ments of fecal~ndicator bacteria in dry weath-
er, which the group obtained from local water 
regulatory agencies. In addition, the organiza-
tion gave one of the La Jolla Shores beaches 
located on EI Paseo Grande and two other 
shores in the area A+ ~rades. 

Pacific Beach Point In Pacific Beach eamed 
the lowest grade in the county, and the group 
placed it on a state list of "Beach Bummers; 
representing the 10 worst California beaches 
based on dry-weather water quality. 

Overall, the group called water quality in the 
county "very good" and 89 percent of the 100 
San [liego monitoring stations were awarded 
"good'to-excellent" marks. The remaining 11 
percent received grades of C or lower. 

Heal the Bay reported in its 14th annual 
analysis that beach quality increased through-
out California compared to the previous four 
years, with Southern California coastlines com-
ing in 6 percent abOl/e the state average. 

Of the 373 California beaches studied, 72 
percent received A grades and 16 percent 
eamed a grade of C or below. 

The organization named Doheny State 
Beach in Orange County the worst in California.

tistically Significant indicator for student reten-
tion. However, the report found that the mea-
sure was less important than whether students 
come from higher income families, are not the 
first in their families to go to college, and start 
out in four-year universities instead of transfer-
ring from community colleges, all of which 
make it more likely that students will stay in 
school. 

Interest rates on federal 
student loans fall 

Interest rates on federal student loans have 
fallen for a fourth straight year to their lowest 
levels in almost 35 years, according to u.s. 
Secretary of Education Rod Paige. 

The new rates are likely to save student bor-
rowers millions of dollars over the lifetime of 
their loans, Paige said. 

Interest on the federal Stafford loan issued 
since 1998 fell to 3.37 percent dctMl 0.05 per-
cent compared to the previous year. For students 
still in school or meeting several other criteria, the 
rate was set at 2.n percent For Parent PLUS 
loans, the new rate w~ set at 4.17 percent 

The interest on most student loans is deter-
mined by a formula defined by law. It sets dif-
ferent rates for borrowers who are still in 
school, for those who are repaying or deferring 
their debt and during grace periods. 

Students who borrow $10,000 in credit at 
the current rate will save more than $1 ,500 in 
interest on a lO-year loan compared to those 
who took out loans three years ago, the edu-
cation department estimated. 

More than seven million students and fam-
ilies take out $52 billion in new loans each 
year, according to the department.

Web site tracks contributions to 
2004 presidential campaigns 

By NATHAN SMITH 
The California Aggie 
(U. Califomia-Davis) 

(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. - A 
new Web site, Fundrace.org, 
allows people to track who is giv-
ing what in the 2004 presidential 
race. The information site lists the 
names of people who have con-
tributed to any of the current 
presidential campaigns, along 
with the contributor's address and 
donation amount. 

Eyebeam, a production studio 
researching the connection 
between the arts and sciences, cre-
ated the site with .the hope of 
learning about campaign finance 
by examining where the money 
comes from. The Web site lists 
any donation of 5200 or more 
made between Jan. I, 2003 and 
March 31, 2004. 

The site offers two search 
options: money maps and a neigh-
borhood search. Money maps give 
a detailed geographical layout of 
donations by political party across 
the nation, even showing the 
amount coming from individual 
streets within cities, 

The neighborhood search 
finds donors by name or location. 
The site then generates detailed 
lists of donors fitting the search 
criteria, displaying each contrib-
utor's name, occupation, employ-
er, contribution and home 
address. 

According to Fundrace.org, 
over 200 people in Davis have 
contributed to a campaign during 
the time listed 

Romain Nelson, a retired 
lawyer living in Davis who donat-
ed 51,000 to Kerry's campaign, has 

mixed feelings about the Web site. 
"Transparency is a way to keep 

society honest, but it also invades 
privacy," Nelson said. 

However, Nelson believes in 
personal contribution and plans to 
donate again before the election 
in November. 

"Politics in America depends 
upon private contribution to a sig-

"

nificant extent," Nelson said. 
"Therefore, it is incumbent of us 
who believe in the political 
process to su pport it financially." 

Retired UC Davis professor 
Joseph Lin donated S2,OOO to 
President George W. Bush ~ re-
election campaign, and has no 
reservations about the Web site. 

"I've got nothing to hide," Lin 
said. "I support things that 1 think 
are very important - it's quite 

easy if you believe in principles." 
Lin said he also feels the obliga-

tion to support his political beliefs. 
UC Davis alumna Sunny Shine 

contributed SI,25O to Howard 
Dean, and she agrees with the 
availability of the information on 
the Web site. 

"I believe in full disclosure," 
Shine said. "I value my privacy 
very much, but we need to know 
who is funding who." 

Although Lin said he would 
donate more if campaign finance 
laws didn't limit contributions, he 
still feels that he makes a differ-
ence in the big picture. 

"I think every little bit helps." 
Lin said. "Its a concerted group 
effort - teamwork is what makes 
it happen. Two thousand dollars 
isn't that much; it takes a lot of 
individuals together to make a dif-
ference." 

Nelson doesn't believe enough 
people are currendy contributing. 

"I think more people should 
[donate) because it's a way of 
expressing our view, our individ-
ual views, politically," Nelson 
said. 

Shine said she also feels that 
more Americans should get 
involved in politics, and is malring 
personal sacri fices to ensure she 
can maintain her own contribu-
tions. 

"I do believe one person can 
make a difference," Shine said. 
"Yet we need to stop being dis-
tracted, I am trying to simplify my 
life so that I need less so 1 can give 
more." 

She believes the largest problem 
is that most Americans don't YOte. 

"I wish there was a way to get 
people to vote, " she said.

all California high school students, regardles of

to complete the University of California's "a_g"

would make California the nation's educational

TUESDAY, JUNE I, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Asian students should embrace their Ifobbiness' 
Students' unique experiences bring diversity to university, country 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

After waiting in line for a good 15 minmes, anyone would have been relieved to 
step onto the shuttle. Usually the 
music in there doesn't bother me 
too much, but today, this particular 
driver 's choice really caught my 
anention . He was listening to 
Mandarin Chinese pop music - I 
knew it was Chinese because I 
understood some of the words. The 
first thought in my head was, "How 
annoying." The Chinese lyrics 
mingled with a trite melody, with a 
few choice English words like 
"love" and "beauty" thrown in for 
good measure. 1 treated the driver's 
election with such disdain proba-

bly because I figured that he wasn't 
American-born, like I was. He was 
different, and, for that moment at 
least, that kind of difference irritat-
ed me. 

the Boat. This term seems to 
hinge on being derogatory, but 
not to an overly serious extent. I 
have many friends who fit neatly 
into this category and are proud 
of it. The most stereotypical ele-
ments of their "fobbiness" 
include: owning cutesy cartoon 
stationary, streaks of blond or red 
in naturally black or brown hair, a 
stash of 99 Ranch snacks, an insa-
tiable appetite for boba, fruity car 
air freshener and designer-label 
clothes from the markets of Hong 
Kong. It's a running joke, espe-
cia lly among Asian-American 
crowds. 

Blatantly unfair generaliza-
tions aside, the fact is that for-
eign-born students, from Asia or 
from anywhere else, make up a 
large portion of the campus popu-
lation . Not to be confused with 
international exchange students, 
foreign-born students constituted 
more than one-fifth of the 2003 
UCSD freshman class, according 
to a recent student survey, and 
30.S percent of freshmen cited 
another language besides English 
as their native tongue - a 15 per-
cent increase since 1986. 
"F.O.B.s" and their other foreign-

. born brethren are certainly no 
marginal minority at UCSD. And 
as these statistics depict, the defi -
nition and makeup of the stereo-
typical "Anlerican" student is still 
changing, and is more diverse 
than in past years. 

It's not that I have a vehement 
dislike for Chinese immigrants, or 
.for those who aren't readily 
.. American," whatever th3t means. 
My parents weren't born here. I 
live with three foreign-born 
friends. Ms:ta was born in 
Indonesia, and Rosa and Angel 
were born in Taiwan. I love them ' 
all. However, the group in which I 
categorize them is susceptible to 
prejudice on my part. The popu-
lar term for those born and raised 
in Asia who immigrated to 
America is "EO_B." - Fresh Off 

I can relate to the classification 
in that I can speak another lan-
guage, albeit poorly. One of my 
greatest qualifications, though, is 
an inability to immediately under-
stand and relate to American histo-
ry and culture before our time. I am 
taking two classes this quarter that 

cover major historical events of the 
past century. As much as I enjoy 
them, it is interesting to me how 
the professors consistently encour-
age us to ask our parents about the 
assassination of John F Kennedy, 
the Vietnam War and President 
Richard Nixon. "Your mom or dad 
will know where they were the 
exact minute Walter Cronkite 
announced JFK's death," they say. I 
look around the room, and many, r 
assume, probably face the same sit-
uation as 1 do. My parents weren't 
here at the time of those landmark 
American moments; they were in 

" Something 1've realized 
nowadays is that 

I actually admire them. 
How cool is it to 

fluendy speak two 
languages? Forget high 

school French, this 
is the real deal." 

Taiwan and probably didn't really 
think about or experience those 
times . 

This isn't to say that memo-
rable American events didn't 
affect those not in America, but 
rather that their foreign back-
ground yields far different narra-
tives, which are becoming more 
commonplace. Fifty-three percent 
of freshmen cited their parents as 
foreign-born . I mew I wasn 't 

alone . 
As someone who was born in 

California and not across the 
Pacific, I must have had it far easi-
er than any of my "FO.B." friends. 
If I think I have trouble relating to 
entrenched pop culture or histori -
cal references of yesteryear, then 
foreign-born students must try 
even harder to grasp and under-
stand concepts within the 
American tliscoursc. 

Arriving in a new country with 
sometimes only a rudimentary 
knowledge of English requires an 
uphill battle. As my friends 
explained to me, they had to work 
extra hard to learn the language 
while still doing the rest of their 
coursework in grade school and 
high school, while sometime being 
subject to extra scrutiny or ostra-
cized for their apparent foreign 
demeanor. 

American culture, to many, is 
something to be learned, assimilat-
ed into and understood. "F.O.B.s" 
may testify that references to 
"Sesame Street" and Mr. Rogers 
evoke feelings of puzzlement 
rather than nostalgia . Superficially, 
cultural icons and memory may 
seem somewhat trivial. We don't 
talk too much about our child-
hoods, do we? But really, flip open 
a magazine, watch a movie or listen 
in class, and the references and 
assumed Imowledge of an 
American cultural regimen perme-
ate almost everything. 

In high school, I used to grow 
resentful listening to my friends 
chatter away in Chinese. "Why 
don't they save it for Chinatown?" 
I thought. "We're in America. Be 
American," I would say dryly. 
Something I've realized nowadays 
is that I actually admire them. 

How cool is it to fluently speak 
two languages? Forget hi gh 
school French, this is the real 
dea l. How unique is it to have a 
past richly endowed with Chi nese, 
Korean , Indian, Dutch, Mexican 
or any other culture's tradition 
but also rooted in merican 
upbringings? 

It 's easy to forget that many 
foreign -born people came ro 
America to lind a better life and to 
enjoy the same political and mHe-
rial privileges that we do. Our all -
American hubris is sometimes not 
just apparent in foreign policy but 
also in the homel and. A "F.O.B." 
friend, Eric, laments that hi s 
appearance off ets interactions 
with others. As my friend Cindy 
put it, "People shouldn 't think 
they're su perior to ·F. .B.s' 
because they think English is the 
superior language." 

[ will admit dista te for loud 
Chinese conversations by students 
and, yes, foreign pop music in 
shuttles. I still readil y correct my 
parents when they forget to use 
plurals in their sentences. And I 
snicker with some friends who 
hold a higher (not-so-serious, I 
hope) dislike for "F.O .B.s." But I 
also admire those students for 
having the best of two worlds and 
for working so hard in what was, 
at one time, a strange country. If 
America is a symphony of many 
cultures, and if America is as 
unique and colorful as the "fobby" 
stationary even I own, then 
"FO.B.s" are as American as 
Coca-Cola. With tapioca pearls.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Aguilar's justification 

doesn t hold up 
Editor: 

I wanted to comment on ick 
Aguil ar 's srarement concern ing 
the ~ hLltdown of Student Run 
Televisio n's broadcas t frol11 the 
May '!. 7 issue of the Guardla1/ 
("UCS D Healthca re pulls plug on 
SRTV"). I1 is justifi ca tion fo r 
shutting down Student Run 
Televi io n's was that "there was no 
alternative avail able because the 
risk of exposing the Preuss School 
child ren to indecent material was 
deemed suffic iently high." SRTV 
was shut down on a Saturday! 
Doe he know that school is 
closed on a Saturday? His justifi -
cation fo r shutting down a campus 
TV network is absolutely ridicu-
lous! I would only hope that 
Aguilar ',does not use this same 
logic when making decisions as 
the director of student policies 
and judicial affairs.

Triton Taxi service 
pays for itseH 

Editor: 
Recently the Triton Taxi service 

has come under fir e both by Joe 
Watson and Charles Dahan, a 
member of the A.S. Council. 
T ho e who oppose the program 
ci te its enormous cost and its ben-
efi t only to those dast.ardly college 
binge drinkers. Since [ live off 
campu , I cannot pass a day with-
out being on the road. Being able 
to drive, walk or ride to school 
wi thout being hit by a drunk driver 
is omething [ might take for 

granted. r have never used Triton 
Taxi, but if it has prevemed even 
one inebriated individual from get-
ting behind the wheel, it has paid 
for itself. [ can always get a job to 
make more money, but no amount 
of working will bring back a loved 
one killed by a drunk driver. I'm 
happy to pay for Triton Taxi, even 
if I never use it. To end the pro-
gram would be short-sighted and 
would cost the lives of innocent 
individuals.

John Muir Colltgr smior 

Dahan doesn't s~ak 
for A.S. Council 

Editor: 
I wish to respond to Charles 

Dahan's letter in the May 24 issue 
of the Guardian ("Triton Taxi a 
waste of students' money"). Mr. 
Dahan expressed his dissatisfac-
tion with the A.S. service Triton 
Taxi. I sincerely hope that this 
letter did not confuse or mislead 
any UCSD students, faculty, staff 
or administration about the role 
of this program. Mr. Dahan 
signed his name, A.S. representa-
tive to the Registration Fee 
Committee. 

Though he holds this position 
and he made his position known in 
the letter, Mr. Dahan was by no 
means expressing the views of the 
Associated Students. 
Unfortunately, he was misusing his 
posi tion and misrepresenting the 
current commitment of the 
Associated Students to the Triton 
Taxi program. As an A.S. represen-
tative, Mr. Dahan should have 
known better. 

I would also like to reaffirm the 
Associated Students' suppOrt for 

Triton Taxi. Many members of the 
A.S. Council, including myself, 
personally believe that Triton Taxi 
is one of the most important pro-
grams the Associated Students 
sponsors. We, as an organization, 
are committed to the safety of all 
UCSD students. This program 
offers a safe al ternative to students 
who are in challenging situations. 
It has successfully limited 
instances of drunk driving and aids 
students who are in uncomfortable 
situations. As a campus communi-
ty, we have decided that safety is a 
priority. This is just one example 
of how we have taken on the 
responsibility of making sure that 
all members of our community are 
safe. 

I sincerely hope that this letter 
has cleared up any misunderstand-
ings. Mr. Dahan'!; words were reck-
less and irresponsible. And I 
strongly and publicly reaffirm the 
Associated Students commitment 
to safety for all UCSD students and 
Triton Taxi.

Editor: 

In recent days, the A.S.

nation against me for my letter to 
the Guardian regarding the Triton 
Taxi program. While members of 
the council initially discussed how 
to remove me from my position as

For convenience use your 

A.S. representative to the 
Registration Fee Committee 
behind my back, when I was 
informed of their discussions they 
immediately attempted to find a 
substantive reason to attack me. 
They argue that it is because I 
signed the letter, W A.S. represen-
tative to the Registration Fee 
Committee." The Registration 
Fee Committee distributes mil-
lions of dollars of student fees 
each year, and after finishing 
deliberations with the committee, 
I found the Triton Taxi program 
to be a fantastic waste and one 
that promotes student alcohol 
consumption. While the Triton 
Taxi program is funded by 
Associated Students and not the 
Registration Fee Committee, I 
found it a shame that other pro-
grams that were forced to be cut 
helped students far more than 
being a chauffeur for the intoxi-
cated. 

ruESDAY, JUNE I, 2004 

I am, in fact, the A.S. represen-
tative to the Registration Fee 
Committee, contrary to the wish-
es of A.S. President Jenn Pae, who 
believes that I am her personal 
representative or the representa -
tive of just the A.S. Council. 
Rather, I am the representative of 
all associated students - which , 
unfortunately, Associated 
Students does not represent. Irs 
adoption of policies without ade-
quate discussion or dissent, such 
as the Triton Taxi program, which 
had basically no alternative clis-
course, is irresponsible and harm-
ful to students, especially when 
the A.S. Council attempts to pun-
ish its own representatives when 
they attempt to engage in such 
discourse. 

As an advisory notice, while 
Associated Students pays lip ser-
vice to encouraging an environ-
ment of open discourse, it in fact 
uses terms such as "accountability" 
to ensure that those who disagree 
with its policies will not be wel-
come or appointed to commitrees. 
Apparently, accountability to Ms. 
Pae and the other A.S. Council 
members means firing those who 
do not conform to their views or 
standards. If I confused anyone in 
my letter, I apologize - as I stat-
ed, the A.S. Council supports the 
Triton Taxi program, as should be 
clear due to its extravagant fund-
ing. I, the A.S. representative to 
the Registration Fee Committee. 
do not. It is worrisome that per-
sonal-attack politics are practiced 
at UCSD, and I encourage Ms. 
Pae to change such a tone - or at 
least not participate in it - next 
year.

Sound off: Koala, chancellor, lecture bias

Marshall College Student Council wages an 
unending war apiast all forms of "offensive" 
conduct on this campus, usually manifested in 
the form of the latest issue of The Koala. The

some tips on how to scare up some school spirit

. Are lecrure halls supposed to be places of higher learning 
- the endless pursuit of academic truth - or ideological 
training camps, where we're taught what to think, rather 
than how to think? Given that liberal-arts professors are 
more often liberal than not - and the ever-50-remote 
chance: that they might be wrong - it's only fair to their stu-
dents that they provide all major theories surrounding the 
material. As a proud American, I cannot begrudge a person 
for having a differing opinion, but professional educators 
should be capable of presenting theories outside of their own. 
We attend universities to learn how to think for ourselves; 
what will we do when we're out in the real world, without the 
ivory tower there to think for us?

8 NEWS THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Co-ops: University role in lease questioned 
continued from page I 

the General Store, the Che Cafe, 
the Food Co-op and Groundwork 
Bookstore. 

Despite the ongoing process of 
renewing the agreement, the let-
tcr states that the agreement and 
the memorandum are still "fully in 
effect" and do not "need the 
approval" of the university. 
Vazquez and University Centers 
Director Gary Ratcliff could not 
be reached at press time. 

Accordi ng to Co-op Oversight 
Commi ttee Chair Kate Pillon, all 
parties are still awaiting a response 
frolll the university, though the 
May 29 deadline the committee 
set has been missed. 

"We're in a limbo state right 
now and negotiations are o n hold 
because of some legal issues," 
Pillon said. "We're waiting for the 
university's response, and negotia-
tions fo,r the existing MSA have 
stopped!' 

The letter also stated that the 
refusal of UCAB to renew with-
out the proposed changes is "an 
unfair if not an illegal breach of 
the Memorandum of 
Understanding. " 

UCAB Co-Chair Justin 
Williams aid he had initia ll y 
thought that all parties were close 
[0 renewing the agreement. 
Williams said that he disagreed 
with the claims in the letter. 

" In my opinion, [the letter] is 
juS! how the co-ops feel about the 
situation, and there is no exp licit 
validity of their view of how this 
process has gone," Williams said . 
"The negotiation process has been 
open and fair." 

Some of the changes proposed 
by University Centers included 
specifying whether certain parts 
of the space are the co-ops' and 

clarifying the university's respon-
sibility to maintain regulations on 
how to request repairs for the 
spaces . 

According to Williams, the 
proposed changes were necessary 
for health and safety reasons and 
included clarifications within the 
agreement. 

Williams said that the stalled 
negotiations could also affect the 
agreement for a Food Co-op 
satellite location in Price Center, 
which has been under discussion 
since last year. 

"My greatest concern was that 
the co-ops have sought legal rep-
resentation , while it is within their 
right to do so, because negotia-
tions have entered a realm that is 
out of student control," Williams 
said . "We're not sure what's going 
to come out of it - what it means 
- but things could possibly get 
more complicated." 

According to GSA Vice 
President of Finance G reg 
Musiker, the GSA is currently 
consulting its own lawyer to help 
determine what kind of effects the 
letter could have on the organiza-
tion. 

"At this point, lawyers have 
been brought in and the GSA will 
have to consult with them before 
pursuing further action," Musiker 
said. "The GSA is in the process 
of consulting with the lawyer, 
mainly to help u with what to 
focus on in the letter." 

According to Pillon, with the 
co-ops invoking a part of the 
Memorandum of Understanding 
tha t dea Is wi th the process for 
informal dispute resolutions, t he 
Co-op Oversight Committee 
could be the body that hears 
arguments from both sides. 

"I'm not sure if this is the phase 

that we're going to stay at, or if 
we'll be able to work it out," 
Pillon said. "We don't know what 
phase we'll be in since the univer-
sity has not had the opportunity to 
reply. [The May 29 meeting] was 
the first time any of us heard of 
this, and we can't do anything but 
speculate." 

The Co-op Oversight 
Committee consists of five voting 
members with representatives 
from Associated Students, the 
GSA and UCAB. There arc also 
non-voting members representing 
each of the co-ops. 

"It is the committee's responsi-
bili ty to act as a buffer between 
the university and the co-ops," 
Pillon said. "The committee is 
really the body that hears infor-
mal disputes and kind of resolves 
any problems between the par-
ties. " 

In 1993, the Law Offices of 
Lottie Cohen wrote and negotiat-
ed the Memorandum currently in 
effect after what Cohen called 
"forceful lock-out and attempts to 
shut down" the co-ops, Cohen 
claimed the current situation is 
similar to past problems. 

"My clients and I are aware of 
the [UCSD] administration's 
bad-faith motives, improper 
interjection into the co-opera-
tives' affairs and misstatements of 
fact and law, all of which have 
been part of an intentional effort 
to squeeze non-profit co-opera-
tives out of space in the 
University Centers in favor of 
profi t- making enterprises," 
Cohen stated in the letter. 

The letter also suggested that 
the university seek its own legal

Preuss: UCSD students tutored seniors 
continued from page I 

point out the other notable 
achievements of the class of 2004 
- namely, scholarship awards, 
test scores and the establishment 
of the school's sports programs. 
The sports program was created 
as the class of 2004 entered ninth 
grade and has now achieved varsi-
ty levels. 

"This class has really estab-
lished a tradition and IPreuss'] 
reputation," Sobek said . "They 
have been very involved with 
inrernships on the university cam-
pus or with the hospital ... With 
their contributions, our test scores 
are number one in the county, and 
we received two perfect lOs in the 
Academic Performance Index 
scores." 

Ten of 300 winners of the 
5l,()OG Ford Scholarship 
Competition were selected from 
Preuss, as were two of the 10 
regional winners for the National 
Hispanic Heritage Awards. 

While proud of their achieve-
ments, Preuss seniors did not 
belittle the hard work and time 
investments put in by both the 
students and those who supported 
them. 

"It was really difficult with the 
class load," senior Amy Mobley 
said. "vVe were taking eight class-
es when otller schools and cur-
riculums focused on far fewer." 

Students creditcd Sobck for 
her help with college applications. 

"The application process was 
stressful, but it got better as time 
went on," UC Berkeley-bound 
senwr Khang Nguyen said. "Ms. 
Sobek helped us a lor - she was 
like our mom." 

Preuss senior Dahlak Yetbarek 
also acknowledged the challeng-
ing periods of the students' time 
at Preuss . 

"There werc definitely some 
rough tllnes, but we had a lot of 
hell'," said Yetbarck, who will

attend UC Riverside. "We had 
tutors for every class and learned 
from each other. We also had a lot 
of support from mentors." 

According to Sobek, Preuss 
School students h ave had a wide 
range of sources of aid, including 

" This class has really 
established a tradition and 

[Preuss'l reputation." 
- Carol Sobek,. head counselor, 

Preuss School 

advisory classes, study groups and 
personalized attention from 
UCSD students coming to cam-
pus after hours to tutor. 

"These kids often leave their 
houses every day at 6 a.m. and 
don't get back until after 5 or 6 
p.m.," Sobek said. "There isn't a 
lot of time to go looking for out-
side help, so we've been sure to 

provide these students with all we 
can. [preuss School] is like their 
second home." 

Mobley, who is headed to UC 
Davis, also viewed the school 's 
close proximity to UCSD as an 
asset to her education. 

"Being so close to campus, it's 
a lot easier to find tutors and 
internships," Mobley said. 

Senior Ryu Schaufus, who was 
able to intern at UCSD's 
Supercomputer Center and will 
be attending UCSD in the fall, 
agreed. 

"It was nice because they 
match you up with a person who 
works in a subject that interests 
you," Schaufus said. "Some of us 
were able to do some kind of 
research with professors as well." 

When asked about the dwin-
dling time to graduation, the 
seniors expressed conflicting feel-
ings. 

"I'm ready to get out because 
I'm tired of being in a small 
school," Yetbarek said. "But we 
feel like a family and have been 
there for each other - I'm going 
to miss that."

Video: SRTV takes calls 
from viewers following show 

conrinwd from pace I 
and Triton Cable officials before 
deciding to air the program. 

Neither Lindo nor "Perfect 
Vision" host Earl Warren College 
junior Daniel Watts have received 
any complaints from the administra-
tion. 

"I think that people have to 
realize that there are heavy, intense 
things going on in the world and 
that ignoring it isn't going to make 
it any better," Lindo said. "1 think 
one of the most important things 
that need to happen when people 
disagree with each other is that 
they should talk about it. " 

administration is trying to require of 
controversial groups." 

According to Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar, stu-
dents are not unduly prevented 
from exercising thei r right to free 
speech on Library Walle. 

"Library Walk is also a public 
thoroughfare and so it is also the 
case that anyone can engage in the 
exercise of free speech, so long as 
they are not using equipment or 
staking out a spot reserved for some-
one else," Aguilar said. "If an indi-
vidual is able to engage in free 
expression without blockin~ the traf-

opportunity to see

tlict that the main-

when people 
disagree with each

Watts also 
objected to Warren 
administration 
pulling the plug' on 
WClV, citing a 
history of editorial 
control by the stu-
dents. Aguilar 
defended the move, 
saying that WCIV

Watts said. "It's easy to find pic-
tures of Iraqi prisoner abuse -
those are allover the place, the 
mainstream media shows that." 

During the show, Watts and co-
host Steve York, a John Muir 
College junior, described the 
recent shutdown of WCTV and 
attempts by students to display the 
Berg video on Library Walk. Both 
hosts claimed that the administra-
tion has a "double standard" 
regarding political demonstrations. 

"It's funny because there are cer-
tain things that the administration 
doesn't kick people otT for," Watts 
said on the show. "Half those orga-
nizations don't make reservations, 
they just set up tables. If there's no 
one else who wants that specific spot 
on Library Walk, it's just ridiculous 
to make them have a reserva tion 24 
hours in advance, which is what the 

resource. 
"It's inappropriate for the univer-

sity or any individual to interfere 
with a student's right to free expres-
sion in a recognized public forum. " 
Aguilar said. "Warren College 
Television is not a public forum." 

Aguilar said that WC1V is an 
educational resource that was 
established by the Warren residen-
tial dean's office for administrative 
and educational purposes . 
According to Aguilar, its policies 
and practices have been to broad-
cast only content detennined by 
the Warren dean to promote the 
college's educational mission. 

Students have been denied 
access to WC1V since May 26. 

Warren Dean of Student Affairs 
Jeff Philpott could not be reached

Plan: Report 
predicts 

. . Increase tn 
parking needs 

continued from page 3 
aren't near anything useful to stu-
dents." 

According to Phegley, 36 per-
cent of all UCSD commuters cur-
rently come to campus using a 
mode of transportation other than 
a car with a single occupant. 
According to the 2004 LRDP, 
UCSD will continue improving 
alternative methods of transporta-
tion, including campus-operated 
shuttles, public mass transit sys-
tems, bicycle networks, carpool-
ing and vanpooling programs. 

Neighbors and businesses in 
the local community have raised 
several concerns regarding the 
long-term growth of the campus, 
including parking and traffic 
impacts, the loss of open space, 
an increase in noise and the 
potential encroachment of uni-
versity usage. 

I low ever. according to 
Phegley, efforts have been made 
to address these community con-
cerns. 

"The plan incorporates signifi-
cant measures to reduce communi-
ty impacts through steps such as 
providing housing for 50 percent 
of the students and the continua-
tion and expansion of alternative 
transportation measures," Phegley 
said . "The plan will continue to 
preserve signifi~ant open space and 
natural areas on campus -
approximately 25 percent of the 
entire campus." 

Both the 2004 LRDP and the 
DEIR are avai lable for public 
review and comment until July 9.

12 FEATURES THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Generation S.L.U.T.' autnor tells 
Beckerman discusses funny, disturbing book 

By DEENA AL SHAm 
Senior Staff Writer 

As the years go by. society 
evolves and changes. and so do our 
attitudes toward sex. WIth 
"Generation S.L.U.T." author 
Marty Beckerman looks at the the 
increasingly rapid promiscuity of 
today's youth in an MTV-pub-
Iished book that is both funny and 
disturbing. The book has three dis-
onct parts: There's the story telling 
the week in the life of a group of 
fictional characters, Beckerman's 
own biographical stories, and sta-
tistics and quotes about teens and 
sex that complement the stories of 
the books. 

GUARDIAN: So, 'Iet's begin 
with the most obvious question: 
What was your inspiration for the 
book' 

Marty Beckennan: [ graduat-
ed high school and went to col-
lege, and came back home five 
months later for winter break. I 
saw that a lot of familiar faces had 
really deteriorated as human 
beings, and it was pretty emotion-
ally distresslOg. When I went back 
to college, [ talked to a lot of my 
friends about this. and they had 
their own horror stories of ex-
girlfriends with cutS, (who) 
slashed their wrists, all kinds of 
weird sruff. I also heard about 
these 13-, 14-year-olds talking 
about all this sruff. so I got really 
interested in hearing about soci-
ety now. I heard more and more 
abom 12-, 13-year-olds commit-
ting suicide, cutting themselves, 
all sortS of sruff, so [the book) was 
Ort of like trying to put together 

the anonymous sex scene that has 
trickled down to elementary 
choo\. [ started asking what this 

is doing to prepubescent children 
and what this would do to their 
psyches, and that's where the book 
came from. 

G: Mixed into the story are 
statistics and comics - what was 
the purpo e of this? 

MB: The point of including the 
statistics was that a lot of people 
would read this and say. "Come on, 
please, this doesn't happen and if it 
does, it's random incidents being 
blown out of proportion." What 
disturbs people the most is the 
gang-rape scene at the end of the 
book, but right after that, 1 quote 
Associated Press stories about l2-, 
13-year-olds in white, affluent 
cOlrununi ties doing all these horri-

b�e things. Even reading through 
that stuff disturbs me - it's like, 
what's happening to our "precious 
youth"? Basically, I included it all to 
back up what I was saying in the 
fiction. 

G: What about the comics? 
MH : That was actually MTV's 

idea. I think they add something 
cool to the book. It's for a genera-
tion that doesn't read too much, 
that isn't very literate except for 
those goddamn LiveJournals. I 
think it breaks up the text pretty 
well, especially for people who 
browse through the book at the 
bookstore. 

G: How did you feel about the 
book being published by MTV? 

MB: Well, "The Perks of 
Being a WallAower," one of my 
favorite books, was published by 
MTV, and that's how I justified 
signing with MTY. Their books 
and TV division are totally differ-
ent, and I did have some reserva-
tions initially. I lost a couple 
nights sleep over it, wondering if I 
had sold my soul to MTV. It·s the 
same issues that some punk rock-
ers have with major labels, the 
feeling of "betraying the scene." 
HBO actually just got the movie 
rights this week. I don't know 
when that will get made, but 
HBO is perfect, because they 
won't back down and put some-
body like Lindsay Lohan or 
Hilary Duff in it. 

G: Why did you include your 
own autobiographical diary stories? 

MB: r used diary mode 59 the 
book didn't come off as a preacher 

CouIIey ~ Milly Bedctnnan 
S,LU. T.: Book explores teenage sex 
and promiscuity in today's youth. 
on a pulpit, like, "I am pure and 
you are all swine." When J was a 
teen, these were the kinds of things 
I struggled with when I was lucky 
enough to get laid. It showed that 
I'm a creature of lust and I'm not 
here to be condescending toward 
everyone. It's more that I'm kind of 
nervous about where we're headed. 
I'd never written serious fiction 
before I tried the novella part; all 
I've done is nonfiction and journal-
ism. The combination of fiction 
and nonfiction backs up everything 
in the novella. And also to say that 
I'm a horny little teenager. 

G: Did you feel that by putting 
all of the events in the book in the 
space of one week. you ran into 
the risk of a "Sweet Valley High" 
soap opera-style book? 

MB: The book is partly auto-
hiographical, but 1 can't say how 
much because the lawyers would 
get nervous. Basically, I compiled 
three years of my life. The charac-
ters are all composites, and I 
ended up cramming three years 
into ollc week. It was really the 
only way, I tried writing it over 
the space of three years, but doing 
it day-by-day was the only way to

Summer reading heats 
up with sex guide 

'Getting it on' author Paul 
Joannides weighs in 

By NENA SINGH 
Associate Features Editor 

"The Guide to Getting It On" 
covers every topic imaginable from 
numerous oral sex techniques to 
how to have sex if you are disabled. 
Paul Joannides, a psychoanalyst-
turned-author, has a frank, down-
to-earth writing style that clears up 
any misconceptions one might have 
about sex, and works hard to 
release inhibitions by championing 
ways to enjoy wild things. 
Joannides took time to sit down 
with the Guardirm and talk about 
his book and all the crazy experi-
ences that came with it. 

G..rdillJl: What inspired you 
to write this book? 

Paul Joannides: I usually tell 
people it was revenge for eight 
years in Catholic school. These 
were nuns many, many years ago. 
I'm also a psychoanalyst, and I was 
trying to find an intelligent, fun 
book on sex for my patients. 1 
couldn't find any out there, so I 
started writing. 

G: How long did it take you to 
write this' 

PJ: I thought it would take six 
months, but it was eight years 
before it was done. 

G: Do you have a least fa\'orite 
section of the book? 

PJ: I am not sure yet about the 
new sections in the book, like the 
Barbie chapter, the bra chapter, 
etc. I worked and worked and 
worked on them. On the other 
hand, they are definitely a direc-
tion I wanted the book to go in 
because it is so important to have 
a sense that our sexuality is a part 
of our culrure determined by our 
economics. It is determined by so 
many different parts of our cul-
ture . If you know how to give the

JoInnides: Psychoanalyst turned 
author covers everything about sex. 
best blow job, or hand job, or oral 
sex in the world, that's only good 
for so long. You need to have a 
broader sense about sexualiry, and 
that's what [ hope to give the 
reader a sense of in this book. 
That's why I have sections like the 
Barbie section - I hope to give 
people a broader sense of sexuali-
ty. Why do we always view 
women's lingerie as being sexy? 
Maybe if we explored that, we'd 
get a better idea of why a certain 
thing is or isn't sexy, or why some-
thing does or doesn't turn you on. 

G: What makes you an expert to 
write about "getting it on"? 

PJ: What's important is that I 
was anything but the expert, so I 
had a very different perspective.

nJESDAY. JUNE I. 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FEATURES \3 

I THE EDITORS' SOAPBOX 
Newspaper kept this new editor in chief in San Diego 

Experiences inspire to keep Guardian fun and responsible in the new year 
By CLAYlON WORFOLK 

Managing Editor 
Like good rock 'n' roll, college 

should be an endeavor in sex, drugs 
and politics - but this is UCSD, so 
I chose journalism. Not that my 
time at the Gwlrditm hasn't afford-
ed at least some venture into these 
areas, but UC Berkeley it ain't. 
Hell, UC Santa Barbara it ain't 
either. 

With a month-old transfer 
acceptance letter from UCSB chill-
ing on my bulletin board. though, I 
grinned and bared the decision last 
year to remain at our fine university, 
to remain, essentially, at the 
GUIlrditm. UCSB had been calling 
my name since an early freshman-
year visit to Isla Vista. Great friends, 
cool girls and a plethora of booze -
in a word. college - await ye who 
enter here, it beckoned. Boredom, 
di illusionment and celibacy - with 
nothing but an 518.000-a-year 
degree to show for it all- looked to 
be my fate otherwise. 

But before completely turning

better-designed automobile. 

Formula SAE has had a short 
and turbulent history with UCSD. 
In 1997, UCSD's first Formula 
SAE team was created. In 1998, the 
car that members created finished a 
meager 74th out of 140. Their 
1999 car improved to 67th. In 
2000, the team created the Y2K 
car, but never made it to the 2001 
event due to lack of funding. 

"Things were not looking 
promising for the Formula SAE 
team at UCSD," said Warren 
senior Micah Bayless, an aerospace 
engineering student and the cur-
rent team president. "I felt that it 
was my calling to change that." 

Bayless was an Oregon State 
University transfer student looking 
for a chance to be part of some-
thing. He attended an SAE presen-
tation at Oregon State in 2002 and 
was thrilled by the idea "of gaining 
valuable career experience while 
working on toys with a team." He 
searched for a university to tJ ansfer 
to that had a growing SAE team in 
need of strong leadership. UCSD 
was the place. 

In the spring of 2003, Bayless 
was unanimously elected president, 
and since then, he has pulled the 
team out of the wreckage and into 
competition in Detroit. 

"This experience has been a lot 
of fun," Bayless said. "UCSD has 
something a lot of students can get

my back on UCSD, middle fingers 
in the air, I decided to answer the 
annual recruitment caU-up at the 
school newspaper. I had some expe-
rience in the field and figured it 
would be a way to learn a little about 
a campus continually maligned as 
apathetic, shut-in and disconnected. 
Plus, I heard they threw parties. 
Hiatus editor RinaJdo handed me an 
app, I chW"IlCd out a test CD review 
and so began a journey of campus 
immersion - punctuated by late-
night office hours and sweatshop 
wages - that finds me here today, 
transitioning into the position of 
editor in chief at the Gwlrditm. It's 
been over a year since I turned down 
VCSB, and I have few regrets. 

The GlUlrdilln has offered me 
things that no amount of rock 'n' 
roll could; ours is a unique niche. 
In a commodified world, it's diffi-
cult to find groups of individuals 
who operate with ideological stan-
dards independent of market 
forces, and journalists, however 
beleaguered, at least aim for this . 
M.istakes are made, no doubt, and 

the institutional bias of newswor-
thiness is inescapable, but main-
taining representative fairness and 
balance is more admirable a goal 
than any business code, and one 
that speaks to the importance of the 
public service journalists perform. 

What does this mean at 1 a.m. 
on a Sunday or Wednesday night in 
the office? It means that those sur-
rounding you truly care about what 
they do - not only because their 
name is attached to the finished 
product, but because they recog-
nize their role in creating some-
thing that holds political , social and 
cultural weight, even on a college 
campus. All in all, those I've 
worked with these last two years 
exhibit this, which in my opinion 
has made them pretty cool people 
to be friends with too. 

In truth, were there no social 
benefits to the job, it would have 
been hard to justify staying. But the 
early-morning visits to Broken Yolk 
Cafe, the trips to Las Vegas, the 
beer bongs and the never-ending 
inside jokes make the experience a 

complete and balanced one. At a 
school as scattered as ours, I've 
found the only antidote to apathy is 
finding or creating the community 
in which you feel most comfort-
able. Some students discover this in 
a student organization, some in a 
place of employment. I've found it 
at the Guardian, and [ encourage 
you, the reader, to do the same. 

Don't hesitate to direct any 
input my way at tditor®ucsd-
guardian.org. But better yet, come 
write, design, read, illustrate or 
photograph with liS . If we are to 
serve UCSD best, we need as many 
interested students as possible from 
all corners of campus. Each section 
and deparmlent will be fielding 
dedicated recruits early fall quarter, 
and I am confident that our new 
batch of editors has the drive and 
commitment to make this next year 
awesome in all regards - and in 
the manner of some of the greats 
graduating this year. 

Evan and Jessica, with whom I 
worked closely on management, 
dedicated limitless time and effort 

to the Guardian, and they leave our 
paper a higher-quality and better-
organized one because of it. Anne 
and her associates have made 
Hiatus, my alma mater of sorts, a 
model section for writer involve-
ment and fun. And the late greats 
who laid the groundwork for me -
Rinaldo, Charlie, Josh - will 
always have a place saved for them 
in our Flamingo room. Thanks to 
everyone who ['ve worked with 
over the last two years. It is to your 
credit, more than anything else, 
that I am where I am today. 

The Student Center expansion 
project may leave us withollt a per-
manent home next year, but I hope 
to make wherever we end up as open 
and fun an environment as po ible. 
Few of us would commit as much 
time as we do if we didn't enjoy 
doing so, and let' face it: jllSt 
because La Jolla hates rock 'n' roll 
doesn't mean we have to also. To the 
readers and rhe writers and all in 
between: prepare for a great year 
ahead, one that [ could nOl be more 
excited to be a part of ... al UCSD.

it looks great on a resume." 

The biggest reward for Bayless 
as the president is seeing his recruits 
worle together and follow through 
with the obligations they've made. 

"People really do show ttue 
interest," he said. "That's got to be 
the greatest thing about this club. 
People come to work, and they 
stick wi th it." 

Most recently, 
the team has been 

Engineers aren't the only stu-
dents who benefit from joining the 
team, according to Bayless. For the 
cars to be built, $2 S ,000 in dona-
tions must be raised. To achieve this 
goal, students with strong financial, 
economic and business capabilities 
are needed. Without them, current 
sponsorships such as those from 
Jacobs School of Engineering, 
Cymer and General Atomics might 

r.c~'er have Leen 
obtained. 

Students with 

worJcing on a new 
vehicle called the 
2K4, which was 
made from the 
stripped chassis of 
the Y2K model. 

"This racecar is 
prettt' amazing," 

If you have a good 
car and a good sales 
pitch, you can get a 

job out of this. " 

marleeting slc.ills 
are also needed, 
since the general 
purpose of the 
competi ti on is to 
design a car that 
can be sold. In 
Detroit, the exec-
utives of each 
company are the 
judges. The teams 
present their cars

The ncecar's

added features include a TEC II 
computer, which automatically 
controls the fuel injection, air mix-
ture and timing; a wireless com-
puter with plug-ins for cameras or 
other electronic monitoring 
devices, which allows the pit crew 
to see whats going on in the car at 
any time; a carbon-fiber Kevlar 
frame, which is almost as strong as 
metal but many times lighter; and a 
push-button shifting system like 
the one used by Ferrari. The car's 
top speed is over 70 miles per hour, 
and its wheel base is 60 inches. 

"Building such a well-designed 
car provides UCSD engineers with 
an invaluable opportunity to apply 
sleills they've learned in college on 
an exciting team project, all the 
while boosting their chances of 
gaining a promising career in the 
future," Bayless said. 

in the form of a sales pitch and 
then the car's performance is tested 
in the Formula SAE race . After the 
race, company executives may offer 
jobs to members from some of the 
teams depending on their slc.ills and 
any innovations they made while 
worlc.ing on the car. 

"If you have a good car and a 
good sales pitch, you can get a job 
out of this," Bayless said. 

The Formula SAE team at 
UCSD is growing at a rapid rate. 
and with a determined Bayless as 
its new president, it shows no signs 
of slowing down. 

"It has been an incredibly rich 
and rewarding life experience, with 
career opportunities to boot," 
Bayless said.

Slut: Thesis there, but 
between the lines 

continued from page 1 2 
make it believable. 

G: How do you think this book 
could relate to the college crowd? 

MB: I would think that college 
kids have learned media criticism 
and critical slc.ills to help them 
challenge notions of how the 
world works. People go into this 
book with assumptions, and if you 
assume teen sex is the same as 
before, you're going to look at the 
numbers and have an excuse. Or if 
people are going to say, "I don't 
see my teens doing this and that," 
you go into the book and read it 

and say, "I don't believe this." 1 
think the challenge here is to go 
into the book with an open mind. 
Even those who like it don't like 
that I don't make a thesis state-
ment in the end, but it's definitely 
there, between the lines. I was try-
ing to challenge the reader to 
make his or her own conclusion -
it's almost a trial in a way. These 
things happen all over the country 
and people should go into this and 
just let their assumptions and 
their guard down for a little while 
to see if it changes their minds 
about anything. 

Sex guide: Author spices 
book up with tequila 

continued from ~ 12 
any point. You have to slap yourself 
after five minutes to stay awalc.e. 
They are totally intellectual and 
written to your brain, which they 
hope is completely disconnected 
from your crotch. A couple of 
medical schools are using my 
book for their medical students. 
That really surprises me . 

G: How did you conduct 
research for the book? 

P}: Sadly enough, most of it was 
with my clothes on. You'd be 
shoclc.ed when you look at me. 
You'd think, "How did this boring 
guy write this book on sex?" That 
was one of the challenges. Much to 
my shock and horror, I would also 
notice this judgmental voice com-
ing up in my writing. In terms of 
sex, I am fairly more IiberaJ-mind-
ed than most people. But it is more 
a result of the experience of writing 
this boole., and not what I went into 
it with . I always had • very lively 
interest or curiosity in .nything to 
do with relationships lIiul sex. If 
you have to spend your life on a 
particular subject, there are cer-
tainly worse subjects. This may 
sound funny, but I ttained for 
almost 10 years in grad school to be 
a psychoanalyst. I did five years as 
an undergraduate at Cal before 
that. However, never in my life 
have I had a single sex education 
course. I grew up in a small farm 
town of Porterville, Calif., a place 
where they do not have any type of 
sex education. I talked to very few 
sex experts. ] did spend a tremen-
dous amount of time in the bio-
medical staclc...~ in UCLA, reading 
everything I could get my hands on 
that looked interesting. 

G: You wrote this book for eight 

years. What helped you pull 
through? 

P): usuaUy the material was 
pcetty boring, so the objective was 
how to ralc.e the boring stuff that 
would get you hard or wet sexually. 
The answer to that was tequila. If I 
was sruck on how to make some-
thing fun, it sure helped. Tequila 
was definitely the fuel for this boole. 
There were a few years where 
TndCl Joe~ had a particular brand 
of tequila that was definitely a type 
of drug experience. I was very sad 
when they sropped arrying it; the 
latter parts of the book suffered 
because of it. I was also very fortu-
nate in that there were a lot of pe0-
ple w!t9 were kind enough to read 
the manuscript as it evolved, and 
give lots of painfully honest criti-
cism. If I had one strength, it is that 
I didn't get defensive IJld I let the 
book benefit from their rather 
harsh, nasty criticism. 

G: You're not bitter at all? 
P}: Not at all, since I mow 

how misguided they all were. Just 
kidding . Sometimes it really 
srung, but I was able to incorpo-
rate the criticism without it hav-
ing the feel of a committee boole. 

G: Do you get fan mail? 
P}: I get some very Ic.ind letters. 

It is a rare day when I get a nasty 
letter. That is gratifying, when 
someone writes in and says, "Your 
book helped me discover things 
about my sexuality and helped me 
understand more about my 
boyfriend. Now we're able to talk 
about things that I didn't even 
mow how to put into words." And 
it's not like the book helps you put 
them into words, but it gives you a 
sense that there is something more 
out there.

Ciinn: Modesty, hard work define athlete 
continued from page :10 

the pres5'.Jre was off me." 
Ginn's most noteworthy accom-

plishment of the 2004 season was 
capping off her Triton career by 
breaking UCSD's all-time scoring 
recotd. Coupled with three separate 
distinctions on AlJ-CCAA teams, 
Ginn is no stranger to recognition 
for her athleticism. 

"It took a lot of time in the gym 
by myself, working on my shot and I 
lot of practice outside," Ginn said. 
"It was a nice mark to leave on the 
program, but it won't be there long. 
It~ a record and records are meant to 
be broken. It was a nice accomplish-
ment because 1 feel like all my time 
at UCSD has paid off.· 

"Paid off" is an understatement. 
Ginn broke Lisa Beaver's 1994 
record of 1,274 career points which 
was set while UCSD was still in the 
less-competitive Division m. Ginn 
passed that mark despite a harder 
schedule and roup opponents. 

"The old record was a Division 
ill record," Ginn said. WJbe compe-
tition It Division n is a lot st:ronp 
than Division Ill, so it's definitely 
tougher to reach that I1'iark than it 
used to be." 

The scoring record may sund out 
as Ginn~ greatest gift to UCSD bas-
ketball, but it is impanant to remem-
ber that the AIl-CCAA teams onto 
which Ginn was elected are selected 

by the league's coaches on the basis of 
a player's ability every game, not just 
the sum of all her efforts. 

"Those awards are always nice 
because they come £rom the coaches, 
and you know that you have respect 
from other teams, " Ginn said. "I did-
n't realize the respect that I'd earned 
throughout the season." 

Regardless, the modest Ginn 
doesn't let her acc:omplishments 
interfere with the impression she 
keeps of herself. 

"They're Dice to have, but it's just 
an award, just a piece of paper," 
Ginn said. "I'd be lyinr to say that it 
dido't have any eft'ect -OIl the way 1 
see myself .. a playa', but what's a 
piece of paper? 

The oldest child in her family, 
Ginn doesn't model herself after 
older siblings or prolasional sports 
icons. 

"My parenD are the ones I model 
myself after," Ginn said. "My 
favorite basketball playa- is Charles 
Barkley, just because he will say 
whatever he WInD to, but I don't 
realJy try to model myself after any-
one. I think it~ imponmt to play 
with class, 10 I try to be a player who 
pbys wim c1ass. 1 don't ltnOIIr myone 
these days who plays like that." 

Ginn's effa:t on the Triton bas-
ketball program will be lasting, 
thourh most evident in those 
women who had the opportwlity to 

play on the coun with her. 
"I think that people will know 

now that success comes with hard 
work," Ginn said. "I didn't know 
what it meant to work hard. In order 
to succeed, you have to put in a lot of 
extra time and energy to put yourself 
above the rest. 1 think that a few of 
[the women~ basketball players) are 
startinr to come in and practice on 
their own. They are learning that is 
what i.t takes to be competitive in 
Division n." 

In four years of competition at 
UCSD, Ginn leava a phenomenal 
leper behind. 

"I think fint about the people 
on my team aod the athletes in gen-
eral: Ginn said. "I think that's 
been the best part, the way that 
these Ithletes III work hard and can 
hold I conversation. I don't think I 
would have come or Stllyed here if 
not for that. I am I bit disappointed 
in our record, but I don't have any 
regrets about playing for UCSD. 
There have been rough times, but 
you're not going to get perfection 
anywhere you go." 

AJ far as lasIing im~ go, 
there is no doubt in Ginn~ mind 
about what her memories of playing 
as a Triton will reflect. 

"The one great thine about play-
m, here has been my teamrnates," 
Ginn said. "They have been the best 
thing about playing at UCSD." 

Women's volleyball losing three seniors 
Smalley, Peterson and Mills reflect on time at UCSD 

Iy CYNnIIA .LADE CHAVU 
Sports Editor 

After a successful 2003 cam-
paign that included a No. I nation-
al ranking and a oerth into the 
NCAA Division II Far West 
Regionals, the UCSD women's vol-
leyball team is bidding farewell to 
senior opposite and outside hitter 
Lauren Mills, opposite Ashley 
Peterson and defensive specialist 
Denelle Smalley. 

Co-captain Smalley has provid-
ed the Tritons with a solid defense 
during her career at UCSD. She 
played 317 games and contributed 
596 total digs. She earned the 
Outstanding Freshman honors in 
2000, racking up 216 digs in 1M 
games played, more than any other 
Triton during we season. 

"My proudest Iccomplishments 
would be making it to the Elite 
Eight tournament in Michigan my 
sophomore year, and also being 
ranked first in the nation for more 
than three months of my senior 
season," Smalley said. 

The 5-foot-8 defensive special-
ist graduates with a sociology 
degree and will be working £011-
time as a veterinary assistant at 
Cardiff Animal Hospital in Cardiff. 
She currently interns as a dog 
trainer and plans to continue her 
internship after she graduates. 

Smalley appreciates the time she 
spent as a UCSD volleyball player 
and all the experiences of being 
part of a team. 

"I will miss my teammates the 

, , 

most," Smalley said. "Being with 
them almost every day of the year 
will definitely leave a huge void in 
my Ijfe. I will also miss the com-
petition. College athletics provide 
the highest level of competitive 
intensity, and I don't think I will 
ever have the chance to do some-
thing as special in this regard 
again." 

Peterson moved from setter to 
opposi te in her second season as a 
Triton in 2001, with 202 kills, 176 
digs and 50 blocks. The 6-foot 
senior also received the Coaches 
Award in 2000. Although 
Peterson suffered an injury in 
2002, she has been an integral part 
of the team during her career at 
UCSD. She graduates from 
UCSD having played a total of 
217 games and tallying 372 kills, 
20 aces, 124 digs and 114 blocks. 

Peterson graduates with a psy-
chology degree and hopes to find a 
job in San Diego. 

"My teammates and I have cre-
ated a strong relationship over the 
past four years," Peterson said. 
"The constant everyday interac-
tion is what I am going to miss the 
most." 

The thitd graduating senior is 
Lauren Mills. The 5-£oot-8 Mills 
had her breakthrough season in 
2002, playing 98 games with 102 
kills, 276 digs and 21 blocks, 
enough to earn her the team's 
Coaches Award. In her four years at 
UCSD, Mills played 320 games 
and racked up 264 kills, 69 aces, 
852 digs and 54 blocks. 

"I can't single out one memory, 
but the common theme is a well-
fought team victory, including 
defeating Cal State San 
Bernardino at their place for the 
(2001) Regional Finals, defeating 
BYU-Hawaii in front of a huge 
BYU crowd and news cameras (in 
2003J and defeating Cal State San 
Bernardino at home on 
Halloween in front of our home 
crowd all dressed in costumes," 
Mills said. 

Mills graduates with a degree in 
psychology and plans to stay in San 
Diego to study graphic design in 
art school. She hopes to eventually 
end up in advertising. 

"n'1I miss J road trips, (head 
coach Duncan McFarland's) U-
turns - although they are reducing 
significantly - pregame rocking the 
boat and R.E.S.P.E.C.T-ing it up, 
celebratory group hultS, solid 
aggressive indoor competition, 
Wattie's concussions, Denelle and 
Duns' Devil and Satlln, the Oompa 
Loompa group, Wounded Soldier 
Disabilities game in the hallways 
and group crossword punles," 
Mills said. 

Although Smalley, Petenon apd 
Mills are graduating, all three are 
confident about the team's 
prospects for next season. 

"Since there are only three of us 
graduating, and we have one of the 
strongest junior classes in the 
nation, next season is looking very 
promising," Smalley said. "I predict 
a possible national championship 
out of next year's team." 

nJESOAY, JUNE I, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 19 

Golf: Scheer led team to NCAA Super Regionals Baseball: Standouts Riddle, Burton, 
Albrecht and Bergstrom graduate c:ontinaei from ". 20 

Always a clutch player though, 
Scheet came up big when it count-
ed, finishing in a tie for 12th place 
at the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championships with a 225, nine 
over par. Scheer strugled in the 
fint round wim a 79, but came 
back with consecutive scores of 73 
to help ensure the Tritons' 
advancement to the NCAA 
Division n Super Regioaals. 

Scheer tumed it up mother 
notch at me Super Rqionals, 
where be finished in a tie for 
eishth place with teammate Joe 
Dolby, with both tuI"IIinJ in an 
even-par score of 216. Scheer 
started the tournament off with a 
70, two under par, and finished 
with a 72 and a 74. 

"The Washington tourna-
ments were the best tournaments 
of the year," Scheer said. "I played 
my best overall, and it's a reaDy 
fun course to play, and • fun alp 
overall. We don't usually get to 
travd that far." 

Unfortunately for Scheer, at 
the most important tournament of 
the season, hi. driver head 
cracked. In light of this, his tie for 
74th place and a score of 317 
across four rounda, a mere 29 over 
par, are quite impressive. His 
score of 72 on the second day was 
one of the lowest acores of the 
championship, but after breaking

averaged acores of 74.S in his fim

more than four over par, across

the team average of 7l.9. 

"I plan on pursuing golf 
throughout the summer and see 
where it goes, possibly taU it fur-

Scheer will be competing in 
the Sill Diego City Amateur Golf 
Championship this year, and 
hopes to qualifY for the U.S. 
Amateur Championship, as he did 
last summer. 

"The San Diego City 
Amateurs is a really fun tourna-
ment at Torrey Pines," Scheer 
said. "It's one of the best tourna-
ments of the year outside of col-
lege. I also plan to go up to 
Monterey to play at Spyglass at 
least once this summer. And the 
U.S. Amateurs is at the same site 
that I qualified for it lilt year, so I 
know 1 can perform there, and I 
have high hopes."

"When this team needed him,

we could not have bad the success 
that we have enjoyed without the 
solid play of Keith throughout his 
career. It will be a big loss to lose 
such a solid player." 

A force to be reckoned with oil 
the mound, co-caplllin Bergstrom 
posted • 5-7 record in 2004 with a 
5.74 earned run average. A four-
year starting pitcher, Bergstrom 
kept playoff hopes alive with crucial 
victories down the stretch in 2004. 
He threw three complete games 
and had 44 strikeouts over 84.2 
innings pitched. In 2003, 
Bergstrom pitched a team-high 
81.1 innings and posted a 5-2 
record, with four complete games. 
He struck out 48 batters and com-
pleted the season with a 4.2 ERA. 

"With the team's season and his 
college career on the line, Raf 
stepped up and threw the game of

O'Brien said. "It was a great win 
toward the end of an outstanding 
college baseball career. It~ been a 
pleasure to watch Raf develop as a 
player and a person. [ am very proud 
of him and his accomplishments." 

Plagued by injury during his 
final season, Hawk struggled to 
catch a break in 2004. In 2003, 
Hawk had a strong showing playing 
in 46 of 53 games. He posted a 
.274 batting average with five dou-
bles, three home runs, 22 RBIs and 
23 runs scored. 

"o.vid had an outstanding 

career for us and has been a plea-
sure to coach for four years, " 
O'Brien said. "He will be missed as 
a good player, but even more so as 
an outstanding person." 

Though Dunldy made just one 
starting appearance on the hill for 
the Tritons in 2004, his undying 
work ethic earned him respect 
from all memben of the team. 
Dunldy, 1-0, earned his first victo-
ry on Senior Day 2004 against 
Vanguard University. In his nine 
appearances on the year, he posted 
a J .21 ERA with seven strikeouts 
in 14 innings. 

"Nolan's attitude while reacting 
to some challenging health issues 
throughout his career paid off on 
Senior Day, .. O'Brien sai d. "He not 
only earned the stan and the win 
that day, but he continued to earn 
the respect of everyone around him 
that day. I'm very proud of his 
growth in this program." 

Detty and Crotts aided the team 
in as many pinch-hitting and relief 
roles as they could this year. 

"Aaron and Trent were players 
who did not get a chance to show 
us their best because of frustrating 
senior-season injuries," O'Brien 
said. "I hope they enjoyed being a 
pan of such a great team their 
senior season and realize that they 
will tlIke away a lot of positives 
from a season that could be looked 
at as a negative year. . 

The success of the 2004 Tritons 
will be the standard for ensuing 
seasons. The can-do attitudes and 
the character of these eight seniors 
will be sorely missed. 

"This team is one of the closest 
groups of guys [ have ever played 
with, and everyone is dedicated to 
outwork each other in order to be 
successful," Bergstrom said.

Basketball phenom Ali Ginn closes the book on UCSD 
Star was three-time All-CCAA team member, Triton all-time high scorer 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Associate Sports Editor 

After leading the Tritons through 
a remarkable 2003-04 season and on 
to a first-ever National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division n 
tournament berth, UCSD women's 
basketball star enior Ali Ginn will 
leave her team after graduation. 

In her final eason with the 
Tritons, the Carlsbad, Calif., native 
set the UCSD all-time scoring 
record with J ,308 points over four 
years of play and went on to earn 
AlI- alifornia Collegiate Athletic 
Association econd Team honors 
along with teammate junior 
Margaret Johnson. The award 
marks the third c nsecutive season 
that Ginn has received recognition 
by the conference. In 2002, she was 
named to tl ,,· ll-CCM Second 
leam as a ophomorc, before 
becolTIlng the fir t member in the 
history of the U D women's bas-
ketball program to be awarded A11-
CCM First ' ream honors in 2003. 

For all of her accomplishments, 
Ginn remain remarkably hwnble 
about her elf and her achievements. 

"When I look back at playing this 
season, I don't think of my succe s as 
a player and how much I achieved," 

Ginn said. "1 think of my teammates, 
the people I met and how much 
impact they have had on me." 

On a squad like the Tritons, 
which has only thirteen active play-
ers and three redshirts, a positive 
relationship with one's team 
becomes a crucial element in suc-
ceeding against other competitive 
Division II schools. 

"Playing at UCSD isn't the easi-
est thing," Ginn said. "There's no 
financial support from the school for 
scholarships, and there is hardly any 
recognition from the student body 
- even after this sea on when we 
made the NCAA tournament." 

The Tritons were downed by 
top-ranked Seattle Pacific 
University in Seattle in the West 
Regional First Round of the NCAA 
tournament on March 12, ending 
UCSD's 2004 season. 

"It was nice to fini h this year on 
a high note and to make the playoffs, 
because that's been a goal of ours for 
as long as I've been here," Ginn said. 
"I think that we could have done a 
lot better this year, but everything 
still came together for us in the end." 

In the four years that Ginn has 
played for the Tritons, the element 
of teamwork has always been some-
thing to consider. After the 2002 sea-

SENIOR SEN DOFF 

Scheer signs last 
score card as Triton 

Golf captain spent most of 
2004 season in top-10 rankings 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Lone senior and team captain 
Alan Scheer will be graduating this 
June, leaving a large hole in 
UCSD's golf squad, which finished 
15 th at the 2004 Division II 
National Championships. 

"This wasn't the year I was hop-
ing for after last year, but it was still 
great to make Nationals and be 
ranked in the top 10 most of the 
year," Scheer said. 

Scheer started off the season by 
proVIng that he was a force to be 
reckoned with, finishing in a tie for 
third place at the Tritons' first tour-
nament of the year, the Western 
Washington Invitational. He had 
two rounds shooting 67, and fin-
ished with a 208, eight under par. 

Going into the last event of the 
fall part of the season, Scheer fin-

ished with a 220, and a 222, respec-
tively, at the Chico State 
Invitational and the Elco 
Invitational. These scores earned 
him a tie for 15th at Chico, and a 
tie for 33rd at Elco. 

In his first tournament back in 
2004, Scheer shot a 215, one under 
par, at the Family Motors 
Invitational, where he tied for an 
18th place finish . In his second 
round, Scheer turned in a 68. 

Scheer was not quite as success-
ful in his next two tournaments, the 
Aztec Battle at the Lake and the 
Cal State San Marcos Invitational. 
The Battle at the Lake found 
Scheer tying for Hrd place, though 
he did improve to a tie for 25th in 
the Cal State San Marcos 
Invitational, where he shot 227, II 
over par. 

Stepping things up at UCSD's 
own Southern California 
Intercollegiate Championships, 
Scheer finished with a 226, 10 over 
par, which earned him a tie for 16th 
place. 

Continuing his upward swing, 
Scheer carried his momentum into 
the Cal State San Bernardino 
Coyote Invitational, where he fin-
ished in ninth place. He had two 
rounds at 71, and finished with a 
218, two over par. 

Scheer fell into a minor slump 
with his next two tournaments, fin-
ishing in a tie for 23rd at the UC 
Davis Aggie Invitational, and drop-
ping to a tie for 43rd at the Cal 
State Stanislaus Buzzini 
Invitational, his lowest finish of 
regular season play. He did manage 
a 223 at Davis, though, only seven 
over par, but turned in a 228 at 
Stanislaus, 12 over par, also his 
worst score of regular season play.

son, when she earned All-CCAA 
Second Team honors, it became 
apparent that Ginn was turning into 
a significant leader on her team. 

"After sophomore year, 1 got an 
award and I realized that maybe I 
would have to step up over the next 
couple of years," Ginn said. 

Without alienating herself from 
teammates, Ginn learned to assume 
a leadership role that enabled her to 
take charge on the court while 
simultaneously contributing as an 
equal member of the team. 

"I think that throughout my four 
years, I've learned how I can make 
myself better," Ginn said. "No one 
can tell you how to prepare but 
yourself. I've learned to worry about 
the things that I can control, and not 
worry about the things that I can't. If 
you do everything in your power to 
succeed, then you've done your best. 
There is nothing else you can do." 

Adopting a team mentality was 
easier to adjust to and helped to dis-
tribute the responsibility of each 
member of the squad. 

"It was nice this year for me 
because the pressure wasn't on me 
the whole game," Ginn said. "A lot 
of people stepped up and suddenly,

SENIOR SENDOFF 

Baseball bids adieu to eight seniors 
Triton sluggers end careers with a big year 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

Behind the play of its stellar 
seniors, the UCSD baseball team 
qualified for the postseason this 
year for the first time since m<.,ving 
up to Division n in 2000. Catcher 
and first baseman Jeff Riddle, out-
fielder Brett Burton, infielder Keith 
Albrecht, pitcher Raf Bergstrom 
and outfielder David Hawk provid-
ed the team with leadership and 
determination throughout their 
years at UCSD. Pitchers Nolan 
Dunkly and Trent Crotts and first 
baseman Aaron Detty aided the 
team off the bench. 

Co-captain Riddle's impact on 
the team over his four years as a 
Triton has been tremendous. 

"Jeff has been at the founda-
tion of our efforts to build a 

national championship-caliber 
program," head coach Dan 0' 
Brien said. "Without him, we 
could not have come as far as we 
have in his four years here. His 
leadership, both on and off the 
field, will be missed." 

Riddle led the 2004 team with 
56 RBIs, 19 doubles and five home 
runs. He batted .348, accounted 
for 38 runs, put up 71 hits and 
drew 38 walks. 

Defensively, Riddle led the 
team with 257 putouts. For his 
efforts, Riddle earned AlI-
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Second Team honors. 
This follows his junior year, when 
Riddle was distinguished on the 
All-CCAA First Team, having 
recorded 43 RBIs, five home runs 
and a .497 slugging percentage. 

Throughout his career, Riddle

season were essential to the team's first-ever berth in the conference playoffs. 

looked to his teammates to play 
hard and work as a cohesive unit 
in order to win games. It is the 
aspect of teamwork that Riddle 
will miss next year. 

"Every position has at least two 
or three other guys that can step 
in and do the job," Riddle said. 
"I've never played with so many 
talented ball players before who 
not only work hard and push each 
other, but support one another no 
matter the circumstances. It's an 
awesome feeling Imowing that 
whoever steps in to play will help 
this ball club tremendously.'" 

Also integral to the Tritons' 
success, Burton became an offen-
sive powerhouse toward the end 
of the 2004 regular season. He led 
the team with a .394 batting aver-
age and accounted for 23 runs Oft 
the year. Burton, who was selected 
to the 2004 All-CCAA Third 
Team, notched 37 hits, including 
nine doubles, three triples and a 
home run, In 2003, Burton hit 
.255, scored 36 runs, drove in 28 
runs, hit five home runs and stole 
21 bases on 23 attempts, 

"Brett developed into an out-
standing all around player and 
stepped up when this team needed 
him to down the stretch," O'Brien 
said. "We don't go to the postsea-
son without Brett tllis year, and 
that's the ultimate compliment." 

Albrecht has been a crucial fac-
tor in UCSD's success in 2004. His 
walk-off home run in the top of the 
10th inning against Chico State in 
the series opener propelled the 
Tritons to victory, keeping them 
eligible for the postseason. In 2004, 
Albrecht hit .304 and had a .452 
slugging percentage. He had 28 
RBIs and knocked 41 hits, includ-
ing five doubles and five home 
fUllS. Albrecht and Riddle top the 
home run list with five apiece. 
Albrecht was the only Triton to
