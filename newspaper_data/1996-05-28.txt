Disabled-Rights 
Activists Speak Out 
PALO ALTO, Calif. - A 
group of Stanford University 
students advocating rights for 
the disabled community 
barricaded the front of a 
campus building May 22 to 
emphasize a need for beller 
wheelchair-access ramps and 
other amenities for disabled 
students. Earlier that week, the 
Disabled Students of Stanford 
group collected more than 100 
signatures in favor of creating a 
new community center for 
disabled students on campus. 
Participants said the barricade 
and the petition drive were 
unrelated.

IRVINE, Calif. - Two female 
UC Irvine students have filed 
official complaints with the

against sociology teaching 
assistant Joe Corbett in the last 
two weeks. The women said they 
were compelled to speak out 
after anonymous flyers accusing 
Corbettofh~mentwere 
posted around campus April 30. 
One student complained she had 
received sexually explicit phone 
calls from Corbett, among other 
unwanted advances. The second 
student said she was accosted by 
Corbett when he brought her 
back to his apartment and 
offered her marijuana. Corbell 
denied the allegations in the first 
incident and refused to comment 
on the second.

UCSD Founds AIDS 
Research Institute 
UNIT: Administrators hope to 
increase cooperation among 
AIDS investigators at UCSD 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

In a move aimed at furthering collabo-
ration among UCSD scientists involved in 
AIDS research, UCSD administrators an-
nounced Thursday the creation of the AIDS 
Research Institute (ARl) as an official Or-
ganized Research Unit (ORU) on campus. 

A May 23 campus notice released by 
Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences John 

Alksne stated that the objective of the ARl 
will be to "provide educational and train-
ing opportunities to the community." 

Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal and Dr. Dou-
glas Richman, current UCSD AIDS re-
searchers, will direct the ARI, the notice 
stated. 

Prior to the creation of the ARl, the only 
program on the UCSD campus dedicated 
to AIDS research was the "Project in AIDS 
Research," established in 1988. 

According to UCSD School of Medi -
cine informational materials, the project 
was "a forum for discussion of research in

Muir Students 
Plan Campuswide 
End-of-Year 
Recycling Drive 
WASTE: Presence of recycling 
receptacle for paper and pia ti 
are now rare on campus 
By Graeme Boushey 
GuardIan Reporter 

s the school year draws to a clo 'e, thousands of 
U D tudents living on campus will not only move 
out of the re idence halls and apartment , but al 'o 
create a remarkable amount of waste in the short span 
of a week. 

Although U SD has facilities for recycling glass 
and aluminum, the lack of paper- and plastic-recy-
cling bins on campus has prompted several Muir 
College students to start a cross-campus recycling 
drive. 

Spearheaded by Muir Environmental Cc.nmittee 
(MEC) Co-Chairs Eric Weiner and Kim Brown, the 
new program - beginning June 3 - will provide 
students with the means to recycle their paper, plastic 
and tin waste. 

Weiner, a enior majoring in environmental chem-
istry, said the idea of providing large containers for 
the recycling of other materials occurred to him two 
years ago, as the MEC cleaned the existing glass and 
aluminum receptacles. 

Weiner said he noticed a large number of other 
recyclable objects in the nearby trash bins, and real-
ized the need for easily accessible recycling contain-
ers. 

The solution, according to Weiner, is making 
recycling convenient for the average on-campu resi-
dent. 

" We thought that if it was easy to recycle - just a 
matter of taking all of your trash Gown to the same 
place you would anyway, and spending a few minutes 
sorting it - then it would probably get done," he aid. 

Although the MEC attempted to initiate the ex-
panded recycling service last year at Muir, Weiner 
said it was a case of "too little, too late." 

To prevent the problem from reoccurring this year, 
the MEC contacted UCSD Recycling Coordinator 
Kri sta Henkels. Weiner said Henkels was instrumen-
tal in helping the MEC expand its program across 
campus. 

"We originally had the intent of just helping Muir 
recycle more, but... we realized it wouldn't be that 
much more work just to do it for the entire campus," 
Weiner said. " It would just be a bigger publicity

UCSD Police Release Final Tally of 1996 Sun God Festival 
The 1996 Sun God Festival brought 

more than 5,000 UCSD students to-
gether and resulted in two arrest , 
according to a UCSD Police Depart-
ment report released last week. 

Event organizer and the UCSD 
police increa ed staffing by approxi -
mately 23 percent from originally 
planned, the report stated. 

In addition, 363 alcohol-related 
contacts - instances in which re 1-
dential security officers approached 
student - were recorded, roughly 
twice as many in an average month. 

The report as erted that the com-
bination of fences and checkpoints 

"resulted in increased alcohol con-
umption in the dormitories," requir-

ing additional police and security staff. 
Campus Protection Assistants re-

fu ed admission to 995 indi viduals for 
not having valid identification, and ' 
confiscated four 10 cards. 

Police estimated that between 40-
50 percent of the capacity crowd were 
non-UCSD affiliates. 

Last year's Sun God Festival, held 
at the Warren Mall, drew more than 
7,000 tudents - the large t turnout 
ever in the festival's 14-year history.

Library Takes New 
Steps Against Theft 
SECURITY: Library tries to combat theft of 
magazines, journals and books by 'tagging' items 
ByAnMdP.teI 
Staff Writer 

A rash of library theft in re-
cent weeks has forced UCSD li-
brary officials to take up in-
creased security measures to halt 
the mounting losses of research 
materials, including magazines, 
journals and 
books - as well 
as students' be-
longings.

into their backpacks. Beale said 
three security guards also patrol 
the library ,looking for suspicious 
activity. Circulation supervisors 
are similarly trained, she said. 

When perpetrators are appre-

"Students are concerned about

the thefts are misdemeanors, 
felony thefls - in excess of $400

"We charge quite a bit of

said. 

Beale said that just removi ng a

Beale added that individuals 
who commit felony thefts are sub-

police make at least one arrest 
every month at the Geiscl Library.

What does the future hold for UCSD next year? 
Ask the Guardian editors. 

UCSD Will Never Grow up 
By Iv .. DeIventhIII 
News Editor 

If UCSD were a person, it would undoubtedly be the 
recipient of lavish praise. "You never seem to age," people 
would say, with an appraising glance. '"fhe years have no 
effect on you whatsoever." 

Indeed, it is remarkable how little UCSD matures as the 
years unfurl. Perhap it is simply an indicator of the fact 
that while age is free, character must be earned. 

Below are a few growing pains that UCSD students and 
faculty can expect to endure during the 1996-97 school 
year: 

o Number of feet RIMAC will sink during the year: 
1.3. 

o Total number of errata the Guardian will run: zero. 
o Number of student parking spaces which will be 

turned into faculty spaces: 203. 
• Number of faculty spaces which will be turned 

into student spaces: zero. 
o Number of eucalyptus trees Physical Plant 

Services will cut down: 226. 
o Number of A.S. election bylaw violations that 

will be filed by A.S. candidates: three. 
o Percent of voter turnout in A.S. elections: II . 
o Number of bicycles which will be stolen on 

campus: 158. 
o Number of days tudents will be able to wear 

shorts: 275. 
• Number of kegs which will be confiscated during 

Sun God: 22. 
o Number of "alcohol-related contacts" UCSD 

police will make during Sun God: 511. 
• Ranking UCSD will receive in the annual 

U.S. News and World Reports undergraduate 
college rankings: 27. 

o Total amount of hamburgers the 
Price Center Wendy's will produce: 

130,000. 
• Number of special admissions 

requests the UC regents will make 
on behalf of UCSD applicants: 12. 

• Number of special requests 
regents willl11llke on behalf of UCLA 
applicants: 108. 

• Number of conferences llCSD 
will host: 240. 

o How many, of that number, the 
Guardian will cover: 74. 

• Number of times students will over-
load the Tioga elevators, causing them 
to get stuck: nine . 

• Number of times freshmen will

serve peace and harmony, the com-
ing year promises to offer one thing: 
exactly what the last year offered. 

Yes, every year at UCSD, it's the 
same old story. Perhaps the most 
consistent theme of all is that the 
"new breed" of students - espe-
cially seniors and the A.S., people 
who claim some position of leader-
ship - will once again boast of 

achie~ement in the year ahead. 
They will promise change: The 
regents will be challenged, whi Ie 
the students will unite and have a 
greater voice in campus affairs. 
Indeed, this sounds very familiar. 
After all, it's the same thing we 
heard four years ago - and even 
before that, I'm sure - when fcos 
were still high, the regents still ruled 
and students had absolutely no say 
in the decision-making process. 

Next year will blend in with the 
years surrounding it, fading into 
obscurity. 

Specifically, the A.S. will contin-
ue to profess true change. It will 
hold embarrassing rallies that 
accomplish nothing more than to 
make the regents laugh and raise 
fees another notch just because they 
know they can. Perhaps the A.S. 
will be even more vocal and active

than in years past. But all the coun-
cil will do is alienate even more of 
the student body that doesn't sub-
scribe to what the minority of 
activists think everyone believes. 

A more vehement A.S. will only 
highlight this realilY by finally forc-
ing the majority to clarify their 
opposition to the protesting minori-
ty.

agrees. Many students don't support 
it, and are more interested in going 
to class and going home than in 
"fighting for a cause.") 

Affirmative action itself will not 
exist, du jour. But for all intents and 
purposes, unfair favoritism of this 
nature will still exist. All it takes is 
an administration - especially in 
admission - that doesn't agree 
with the regents' decision to see to it 
that minorities continue to get spe-
cial treatment. 

Beyond that, it only takes a cur-
sory glance around campus to see 
that affirmative action is alive and 
well in every facet of college life, 
even if it winds up being eradicat-
ed from admissions. With endless 
clubs, organizations and gradua-
tion specific to one "ethnic" 
group, all of them seeking to 
exclude whites, affirmative action 
has never been more prevalent, The 
regents can do their best, but, sadly, 
they will never be able to rid the 
campus of this type of discrimina-
tion. 

And so life will continue as such 
at UCSD. Amid the never-ending 
construction across campus, stu-
dents will walk to and from class in 
an uninterested fog, never topping 

b'pINION 5 

to consider the issues except for a 
rare voice of reason emanating from 
the distance in silenttltidity. 

UCSD is Easily 
Forgotten 
By.,.. •• ....., 
Features Editor 

Each year, U.S. News and World 
Repons prints its college issue, in 
which the top undergraduate 
schools are ranked nationally 
according to various criteria. 

As always. UCSD fared well in 
last year's rankings, placing 43rd 
overall. But while scoring strongly 
in most of the major areas -
including academic reputation, stu-
dent selectivity. and retention rate 
- UCSD faltered in one notable 
category: Of the top 50 schools, it 
ranked dead last in "Alumni Giving 
Rate" (AGR). 

The average AGR of the top 50 
was 28 percent, well above the pal-
try 6 percent that UCSD received 
last year. Princeton University 
ranked highest, tipping the scales 
with a 56 percent AGR. Compare 
our school with other UCs: 

• Los Angeles - 15 percent

FUTURE: 
ContInued .... .,... 5 

• Santa Cruz - 12 percent 
• Irvine - II percent 
• Berkeley - 10 percent 
• Davis - nine percent 
Of course, these sorry statistics 

can be attributed to a number of 
factors, but two reasons seem espe-
cially prevalent: Students do not 
especially enjoy going here, and 
students don't want to support 
UCSD once they're gone. After 
they've graduated, they just don't 
feel any particular attachment to 
their alma mater. 

So what can be done to enhance 
student attachment, both during and 
after their college experience? 

Improve school spirit, for one. 
To say that UCSD lacks school spir-
it is like arguing that rain is wet; 
everyone Imows that the university 
has the collective pulse of a dead 
man. 

To promote spirit, many people 
point to the need for an intercolle-
giate Division ( athletic program 
and, in particular, cite the lack of a 
football team. Athletics are a com-
mon rallying point which can bring 
together a diverse campus popula-
tion. 

In addition, athletics would give 
the alumni something tangible with 
which they could identify long after 
graduation. For example, NOire 
Dame's athletic program - specifi-
cally f()()(ball - does this and pr0-
vides graduates with something in 
which they can actively participate. 
Not surprisingly, their AGR is 48 
percent. 

More likely, UCSO's miserable 
alumni support and meek school 
spirit can be traced to a deeper 

source: the five-college system. 
In theory, the system sounds 

beneficial. UCSO's sizable under-
graduate base is divided up into 
smaller groups, making it easier for 
the students to be served. It also 
provides students with a smaller 
entity with which they can identify 
amid the sprawling university envi-
ronment. 

In practice, however, the only 
real differences as far as students are 
concerned are in the divisions of on-
campus housing and varying GE 
requirements. The system offers lit-
tle else, especially in the realm of 
individual college identification. 
After students move off-campus, 
there is nothing 10 provide them 
with a sense of being part of the 
community, either with their partic-
ular college or the university. 

Individual college activities are 
largely geared to srudents living on-
campus, while campuswide events 
are rare, and infrequently anended. 
The result is that students are denied 
the ability to identify with any col-
lege at all. 

As my own college career winds 
down, I will predict the future. Will

educations money can buy? You

Some of us are graduating in a 
few weeks, some of us in a few 
years. Who knows what the future 
holds for any of us? Only time will 
telL but indulge me while J make a 
few educated (and a few not so edu-
CIfCd) guesses about whaa 1996-97 
holds for UCSD. 

No matter what you do or 
where you go, you can't gel away 
from politics. Studenls First! 
essentially swept this year's A.S. 
elections, so next year's council 
should at least have less of the 
petty infighting that marked this 
year's council. 

At. for the regents - well. what 
they're going 10 do is anybody's 

guess. UC Berttcley law student 
Jess Bravin, next year's student 
regent, can walk the walk and talk 
the talk well enough to blend in with 
his fellow regents - but don't thi"" 
for a minute that he'll put their inte'r-
ests before ours. 

And hopefully, due to his efforts, 
the regents will start to pay some 
attention 10 the speakers during the 
so-called "public comment period" 
at meetings. 

Things seem to have sell led 
down between the Che Cafe and the 
administration, but don't count on 
the relative peace lasting much 
longer. The administration has been 
fighting the CM and its brethren 
since the first co-op emerged from 
the primordial ooze, and both enti-
ties still haven't kissed and made 
up. 

And speaking of the adminis-
tration, Robert Dynes officially 
becomes chancellor on July I. He 
thinks UCSD lacks a sense of 
community, and he's right. On 
Friday nights, this place is deader 
than the county morgue. Anyone 
looking for a party school should 
have gone to SDSU. It 's not the 
chancellor's job to act as a one-
man UCSD cheering squad, but he 
does set the overall tone of the 
campus. 

I predict that Bob Dynes will not 
become another Dick Atkinson. He 
will throw open his office door once 
or twice a week. He will hang out in 
the Grove periodically. He will walk 
around campus and get to know the 
students who strive for more than 
just mediocrity. Maybe he will eat 
lunch every now and then in a cam-
pus cafeteria. 

And don't even talk 10 me about 
parking.

Don't_ Bet on 
These 
Predictions 
IIy ..... Jo ...... 
Co-Opinion Editor 

I couldn't make a prediction to 
save my life. I mean, I always know 
what's going to happen, because my 
superior, analytical mind collects 
data and processes it to the Nth 
degree (whatever that is) - but my 
computer-like analyses never seem 
to actually mesh with reality. 

For instance, in the eighth grade, 
I made four $5 bets on the Patriots 
to destroy the Bears in the 1986 
Super Bowl, knowing I'd rake in a 
quick 20 bucks. Of course, the 
Bears plastered the Patriots, and 
subsequently, I went into hiding and 
never paid off my debts. 

Anyway, what the above should 
illustrate to you is that when I make 
a prediction, you must bet against 
me. I believe that the following pre-
dictions for the next school year are 
inevitable consequences of this year. 
But then again, I thought thai. the 
regents would never freeze fee 
hikes, that Californians would never 
pass a measure as idiotic as 
Proposition 187 and that San Jose 
would ever be more interesting than 
San Diego. My predictions: 

• The A.S. will continue to pass 
useless resolutions which address its 
opposition to starvation, disease, 
war and death in general. 

• The administration will attempt 
to encroach on the Guardian's inde-
pendence, and this attempt will fail. 

• The GlIQrdiDn editorial board 
will continue to ridicule student 
activism.

all other forms of paper- includ-
ing phone books, fa.x paper, card-
board and colored paper- will be

Whi Ie Weiner said the ex-
panded recycling program wi 11 not 
generate much money, he said it 
would be relati vely self-sufficient. 

Hen kel s, whose office recycled 
around 57 tons of paper at $1 0 per 
ton during move-out week last 
year, said that the recycling con-

The UCSO Guardian 

tainers will cost approximately 
$100. 

The MEC plans to post flyers 
and signs to let studenls know 
about the recycling drive. Weiner 
said he fell the drive will be a 
success if people know about it. 

"It provides an option for many 
people who wouldn't ordinarily 
recycle to do so," he said. 

Students looking for more in-
formation about on-campus recy-
cling can contact Weiner by e-

ing for the student." 

Allhough the library does not 
maintain statistics on annual thefts, 
Steel said students' belongings are 
generally stolen several times per 
week. 

There are also at least two or 
three people caught stealing library 
materials every month, Beale 
added . 

Both Steel and Beale said the 
actual number 'of thefts is prob-
ably greater, because most thefts 
go unsolved. 

"There are undoubtedly things 
that walk out of here that we never 
know about," Steel said. 

According to Steel, the library 
must absorb the costs of.the stolen 
malerials if no one is apprehended. 

"If Ihey are not caught, the li-
brary has to determine whether to 
replace the item and find some pot 
of money to pay for the theft," she 
said. "The cost of that will end up 
coming out of our budget."

or most NCAA coaches, the end 
of the season is a time to relax, 
look back on the year and return 
to the facets of life pul on the 
back burner during the athlelic 
campaign. For one UCSD 
coach, however, the end of this 
year 's basketball season 
marked the beginning of the 
greatest struggle of his life. 

For the past three months, 
Triton men 's basketball Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier has been fighting an off-the-court 
batlle with a litlle-known syndrome called 
Gui lIain-Barre, which threatened 10 leave

after the Tritons' final game of the season, 
Lanthier found himself paralyzed at his 
Carlsbad home. 

'" could talk, I could hear, but) could 
not move anylhing," Lanthier aid. "r 
could not move my leg or my anns." 

Lanthier's wife, Jill , quickly called his 
father, Butch Lanthier, who took hi son to 
the emergency room at Tri-City Medical 
Center in Oceanside. 

"Everything happened so fast and I did 
not understand what was going on at first ," 
Lanthier said, recalling the series of tests 
and treatments that began upon his arrival 
at the emergency room. 

The emergency physician on duty 
examined Lanthier and, following a CAT

one in every ioo,ooo people. 

") was very fonunate to be diagnosed as 
quickly as , was," Lanlhier said. "They 
called a neurospecialist right away, and it 
just so happened Ihat Guillain-Barre was 
his specialty." 

Guillain-Barre is an illne . that innicts 
extensive damage on nervous tissue by 
confusing the body 's own immune syslem. 
While the syndrome is initially triggered 
by a virus, the actual damage occurs after 
the virus has left Ihe body. The immune

nervous system, which controls 
vital bodily functions . The major 
concern is that the patient might be 
unable to breathe or swallow, and 
would then choke. 

Lanthier was transferred to the 
intensive care ' unit at Tri-City, 
where he underwent a process 
called plasmapheresis. For six 
days, the doctors pumped his blood 
through a dialysis-like machine 
thai takes out the confused white 
blood cell . 

"They fi Iter the blood out, actu-
ally attach an indwelling catheter to 
a vein above the heart and pump 
your blood lhrough a machine," 
Lanthier sa id . 'They separate the 
plasma from the while blood cells 
and pump the pure plasma back 
into your body." 

The goal of plasmapheresis, a 
process which has been in u 'e for 
eighl years, is 10 induce the body 
into producing new white blood 
cells which are unaffected by the

disorder_ 
The process does not work for 

all Guillain-Barre patients, but in 
Lanthier's case, it stopped the 
degenerative process and put him 
on the road to recovery. 

Because the doctors were able 
to immediately diagnose the prob-
lem, Lanthier's condition had not 
reached the critical stage in which 
reversal was impossible. 
Nonetheless, his quick recovery 
surprised the medical slaff at Tri -
City. 

"Actually, the neurospecia list 
said that I recovered fasler than 
anyone that he's been in contact 
with, and he has dealt with a lot of 
Guillain-Rarre patients," Lanthier 
said. 

While the fact that it was diag-
no ed so quickly played a major 
role in hi s ability to overcome the 
illness, Lanthier also credit s sup-
port from his family. 

"1 think that I was very fortu -

nate," Lanthier said. "I had a lot 
of people pulling for me and sup-
porting me. My family is here. 
My wife and children, my par-
ents and my brother are all in the 
area . I had people come by 
everyday." 

Of course, it does not hurt to 
have a strong-willed, can-do atti-
tude on your side. LanLhier 's expe-
rience as a coach has taught him 
that you cannot dwell on an unfor-
tunate situtalion. 

HJ' ve never been the type of per-
son to sit around and say 'Why 
me?''' Lanthier said . " It 's like 
when your best player goes down. 
You can't just sit around thinking, 
'I wish I had this player.' You have 
to go on and coach the players that 
you have." 

Lanthier was quick to praise die 
faculty at Tri -City Memorial 
Hospi tal.

Disorder caught in time 
ContInued from pc. 11 
standing," he said. "I'm guessing that 
they made it a lot more bearable than for 
some Guillain-Barre patients." 

After undergoing eight days of intensive 
care, il was deemed safe for him to begin 
physical therapy, and he was moved to the 
hospital rehabilitation ward for three 
weeks. It was no easy task retraining and 
rebuilding strength in his muscles and 
nerves so that he could begin to move and, 
eventually, walk. 

"[( 's more of a stamina thing," Lanthier 
said. "It 's not like a stroke victim who has 
actually forgotten all of those things. You 
have nerve endings that were damaged that 
are now hCllling and learning to creale the 
righl impulses again." 

The UCSD Guardian 

than the previous day, he continued pr0-
gressing. 

More than anything, this allowed him to 
maintain a positive outlook and to give him 
faith that he would ultimately beat the syn-
drome. 

"It never got to the point where I was 
thinking, 'I'm never going to recover. I'm 
going to be [in the hospital] forever,'" 
Lanthier said. "I got betler everyday." 

At this poin!, Lanthier has all but beaten 
the illness. Effects still linger, however, and 
the damage done to his nerve cells will take 
some time to heal. His ti sue and organs are 
still sapped of energy, due to the lower 
nerve-cell count. 

"I' m healed physically, but r have no 
stamina," Lanthier said. "\ have to take a 
nap every afternoon." 

Despite the hardships, not eVl(n 
Guillain-Barre could keep the man from his 
game. After finishing his physical- and 
occupational-therapy sessions in about a 
month, Lanthier looks to resume his bas-
ketball operations. 

house and I can drive. For a while, I had 
numbness in my fingers and my feet, but 
that's all gone now." 

With the return of his reflexes, the 
Lanthier family sees the hopeful signs of 
complete recovery. Even better, the 
chances of a recurrence are slim to none. 

"The doctor told me that he's never seen 
Guillain-Barre reoccur in somebody who 
recovered their reflexes," Lanthier said. 
"Now I'm just back in the pool of one in 
IOO,O<Xl." 

He was given the rest of the year off 
from his teaching job at Vista High School, 
and assistant coach Kevin Barbarick has 
done a good job of holding things together 

• at UCSD. 
Recruiting has been exceptional, and 

the Tritons have added two much-needed 
big men for the 1996-1997 season. Lanthier 
again will be at the helm as the team tries to 
improve on last year's 11 -13 record.

Lanthier has noticed steady improve-
ment since finishing Ihe plasmapheresis 
treatment. Whether il was simply being 
able to move Iwo loes inslead of one or 
being able to stand for 30 seconds more

Lanthier said. "But f'm up and around the 

"It never once dawned on me that I 
would not be coaching," he said. "As long 
as I'm thinking and talking, I know I'm 
going to be coaching somewhere. That's 
my passion, my love." 

Up and at 'em: Lanthier is not only back on his 
feet, but will be guiding UCSD basketball next year.

FUTURE: 
ContInued from paee 8 

• Ten TGs will be planned, only 
five will actually happen, and only 
one will be any good. None will fea-
ture good beer. 

• Chancellor Roben Dynes will 
be more decisive Ihan Interim 
Chancellor Marjorie Caserio and 
more accessible than former 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson. 

• The Sun God Committee will 
attempt to recreate festivals of yes-
teryear by signing some quality acts 
which will play past midnight. 

• Andy Dick and other comedians 
will not appear at UCSD, because 
the Thoughl Police (An A.S.-sup-
ported student organization, no 
doubt) will insisl that these comedi-
ans tell politically sensitive jokes. 

• UCSD's official campus news-
paper, the New Inliicalor, will con-
tinue to publish narcissistic journal 
entries about the meaning of life, 
reviews of tri ps to Easter Island, and 
uninteresting fiction aboul tongues, 
whips and sexual identity. 
Meanwhile, it will never, ever 
address campus-related is ue (or 
issues related to anything else). 

• Voz Fronleriza will still nol be 
able 10 edit its text. 

• The Koala will publish two 

issues (only if ilS SIaff begilL'l pr0-
duction clJring the summer). 

• The Califomio Review will con-
tinue 10 publish gun reviews, made-
up letters and bad writing which 
doesn't presenl a decent argument. 

• All the conservative opinion 
writers al the Guardian win contin-
ue to perpetuate the idea that 
instances of police brutality repre-
sent aberrations, rather than indica-
lions of problems within the system. 

• No one will know or care that 
the Guardian swept the California

UCSD and athletics - these two 
concepts do not go hand-in-hand. 
Let's face it : The UCSD communilY 
has never embraced Triton sports. 
Most students would prefer to 
review their lecture n tes for a fifth 
lime rather than go 10 a soccer match 
and checr on their schoolmates. I 

, , 

The UCSD GIWdiaia - . . 

have a feeling, however, that next 
year will be different. 

How do I know, you .1 Well, 
let's just say that the Sports Fairy 
came to me in my dreams. Dressed in 
Triton royal blue-and-gold, the Sports 
Fairy tokl me how A.S. President 
Coleen Sabatini will increase athletic 
interest at this university. 

Her plans for next year will 
include an annex building 10 
RIMAC. This facility, dubbed 
Coleen's RlMAC Annex Place 
(C.R.A.P.), will employ a staff of 500 
employees. C.RAP. will generate 
more interest in our teams by adver-
tising around campus and paying stu-
dents to attend sporting evenlS. 

These improvements will create 
a domino effecl in UCSD sports. 
Because of C.RA.P., more people 
will show up at campus sporting 
events. The grealer attendance will 
increase our players' confidence, 
thus inspiring each leam to play with 
increased intensity and fire. 

In the fall, both Triton soccer 
tearns will play before a packed 
Triton Stadium and advance to the 
playoffs. Women's volleyball will 
reach the playoff as well, where 
they will have the advantage of hosl-
ing NCAA regionals amid the deaf-
ening roar of the now-lively RIMAC 
Main Arena. Inspired by the return

In a lragic tum of events, howev-
er, C.R.A.P.'s foundation will sink in 
late December, bringing lhe building 
crumbling 10 the ground and 
prompting this very publication to 
grace the front page with the head-
line, "C.R.A.P. Gets Flushed." 

With C.R.A.P. in the loilet, the 
UCSD community will revert to ils 
old ways and ignore UCSD sports. 
Both soccer teams, volleyball and 
the cross country squad wi II su ffer 
from low morale and bow oul of the 
playoffs. It will become apparenl 
that the tOlal cost of building the 
now defunct C.R.A.P. will be paid 
solely by the sludents, causing a fur-
ther rifl between athletics and the 
campus communilY. 

Finally, the administration will 
choose 10 cease funding for all 
sports, and athletics at UCSD will no 
longer exist. The money previously 
allocated 10 sports wi II fi nance a 
Biomedical Computation 
Departmenl and RJMAC will be 
used as a donnitory for incoming 
fre hmen. 

So, if you think that 1997 will be

think t \\lice - the Sports Fairy never

In the hole: Junior Arnie 
Campbell drops in art easy putt 
on his way to a team-best 294. 

GOLF: UCSD 
drops to third place 
Continued from ..... 20 
The 1993 championship team came 
from behind to win at Torrey Pines, 
allowing that tearn the lUXUry of not 
having to maintain a lead going into 
the last day. UCSD's four-day total of 
1196 was the second-lowest total in 
Triton history -just three shots higher 
than the 1993 total of I 193. 

'1'hey played like champions," 
Wydra said. "[Cairns) played unbe-
lievable for us. He was our emotional 
leader. Greg Uberuaga had a great 
tournament as well." 

By the end of the day, however, 
UCSD had to fight off John Carroll 
for third place. Campbell was faced 
with a 4O-foot birdie putl, which he 
could have easily three-putted, while 
his John Carroll counterpart had a 
seven-foot birdie chance. 

"[Campbell] got the ball about 
seven feet from the cup," Wydra said. 
'11Ie John Carroll player rimmed out 
his birdie attempt, leaving a little 
chicken on that bone, as we golfers 
say. And [Campbell) came up and 
buried the par-putt to secure the third-
place finish ." 

The UCSD Guardian 

WORM: Dennis 
Rodman, the hero 
Continued from P". 20 
seasons there, from 1983 through 
1986, Rodman averaged an 
unbelievable 25.7 points and 15.7 
rebounds per game. 

Still a lillie· known player when 
he entered the 1986 NBA Draft, 
Rodman wasn't selected until the 
27th overall pick by the Detroit 
Pistons. In his seven years in the 
Motor City, Rodman helped the 
Pistons capture two NBA titles. He 
was traded to the San Antonio Spurs 
in October 1993 and then to the 
Chicago Bulls in October 1995. 

During his 10 years in the 
NBA, Rodman has amassed a 
slew of awards, including five 
consecutive rebounding titles -
a feat matched only by Moses 
Malone. Over the span of his ca· 
reer, Rodman has averaged 13 
rebounds per game. 

I have to be honest. I don't like 
tattoos. I don't like no9C rings. I 
don ' t like belly bUllon rings can· 
nectedtoearrings viachains. l don't 
like outrageously dyed hai r or mul · 
tiple piercings or Harley Davidsons 

or gay bars or exotic birds or even 
Madonna. In fact, ) don't particu-
larly like much of anything that 
Rodman seems to live for in .his 
spare time. But even so, I Ciln't 
help myself. 

For me, Rodman epitomizes 
that which makes professional 
athletes such extraordinary indi-
viduals . He is an invaluable asset 
to the Chicago Bulls, providing 
the team with a truly "blue-col-
lar" mentality in the paint and 
much-needed second-chance shot 
opportunities. 

Rodman dreams of loose balls 
in hi s sleep, and in games, he hits 
the hardwood about one out of 
every two trips down the court. 
He is a tireless tribute to what a 
well-conditioned body can ac-
complish. He wears opponents 
down with his springy, unfazeable 
play, frustrating his normally 
stoic competition. During half-
time, he rides a bike in the locker 
room, while Jordan and Co. are 
toweling off and downing Dixie 
cups of Oatorade. 

On the offensive end, where 
Rodman is pretty much the antith-
esis of a scorer, you will never see 
him concede a rebound. And as a 

.. Tuesday: May 28, 1996 

result, the: Worm spends most of 
his minutes in uniform with an op-
ponents' forearm pinned against 
his windpipe or an elbow smacking 
at his jaw. 

We all like to think of ourselves 
as "rational" beings. At least I like 
to think I am. But sometime, we 
sidestep the logic systems we have 
created for ourselves. In some in-
stances, we show just how "irratio-
nal" the human mind can be. In rare 
cases, we surprise even ourselves. 

[ think that deep down, I can't 
help but connect with the athlete 
behind the image. Dennis Rodman 
has a purposefully downplayed 
pa sian for the game that I cannot 
help but respect. [ should hate him, 
but I can' t. 

During yesterday'S game, I 
caught myself drifting off at one 
point in the second quarter, right 
before Shaq shoved Rodman, It was 
then that I swore I could almost 
hear the melody of a new Gatorade 
jingle: ") wanna be, I wanna be, I 
wanna be like Worm, if I could 
be .. . " 

Don ' t hold your breath, 
though. I'm not planning on get-
ting pierced anytime soon... at 
least not my nose.

MLS: The newest 
U.S. soccer league 
may be the best yet 
Continued from Pac. 18 
saved a penalty shot by Kansas City, a 
virtuaJly impossible feat in soccer, 
25,000 fans in the Rose Bowl- and 
thousands more watching in Mexico 
- went into a frenzy. 

In addition, the league put Cobi 
Jones along with Campos on the Oal-
axy. Jones, a UCLA graduate, has a 
large following in the Los Angeles 
area. Similarly, Eric Wynalda wound 
up on the San Jose Clash in his home-
town. And, in poetic fashion, he scored 
the winning goal in the league's inau-
gural game in San Jose on April 6. 

But while credibility is important, 
nothing beats the actual product. For-
tunately, the star players havecontrib-
uted to an excellent level of play. 
Wynalda even boasted that, "There is 
not that much of a difference in the 
level of play between Europe and the 
United States. Two or threc years from 
now, we should take our champion 
and play the best in Europe, and ) 
guarantee we'll beat them." 

Clearly, the MLS has awakened 
the thousands of sleeping soccer fans 
in the United States. But if it hopes to 
achieve long-term success in the vein 
of the NBA, NFL or Major League 
Baseball, it has to attract the average 
sports fan and tum him into a soccer 
fan . Such a dichotomy of longtime 
fans and new ones has been a major 
obstacle to leagues in the past. 

Cute changes and Americaniza-
tions of the game have only made 
sports fans laugh, while chasing away 
the real soccer supporters. Indoor soc-
cer, for example, will never suffice. 

While the MLS has introduced a 
new shoot-out process to decide tie 
games-the players dribble towards 
the goalie from farther out, rather than 
shooting a stationary ball - along 
with a fancy new ball, the league has 
managed to avoid tinkering with the 
game's integrity. 

There was talk of enlarging the 
goal to increase scoring, primarily in 
response to American complaints 
about soccer's infamous 1-0 finals. 
But thankfully, MLS officials have 
not yet taken such drastic measures. 

Besides, the low-score argument 
does not hold, as most sports fans 
would drool at the thought of a well-
pitched, 1-0 World Series game. But 
with soccer, they quickly dismiss it as 
boring, rather than the rc'sult of good 
defense and solid play. It isonly igno-
ranceand unfamiliarity with the game 
that has prevented more fans from 
following the spon. 

The lack of a decent league with 
quality players has prevented the nec-
essary learning process. OncetheMLS 
establishes its core base of fan ,addi-
tional support will soon follow and 
the new fans will come to appreciate 
even the 1-0 scores. No doubt, work 
still remains to be done. The league 
must continue to expand on the areas 
it has already targeted, such as quality 
players, decent salaries (a current av-
erageofS63,OOO)and legitimate spon-
sorship(Nike, MasterCard, Fuji Film). 
But the early success is clear and 
encouraging. 

While ESPN SportsCenter hosts 
will poke fun at MLS highlights, the 
mere fact that the new league is regu-
larly covered on the show gives offi-
cials 8nd players reason to believe in 
its future. And while simply having 
their game scores displayed on vari-
ous channels' sports tickers might not 
strike many people as symbolic of a 
major triumph, soccer fans will beg to 
differ. On April 13, 69,000 people 
differed. And more continue to differ 
every day. 

SIX: Tritons earn 
All-American honors 
Continued from PC. 20 
before my third throw, I stopped 
noticing the rain. [After that throw ), 
I lcind of knew in the back of my 
mind that I had secured third-place." 

Buehler was not alone in theevenL 
Teammate Geoff "Buzz" Lambert, 
who has two more years of athletic 
eligibility, narrowly missed c1aim-
ing All-American honors forhimself 
as he finished in ninth place,onespot 
short of the honor. 

Buehler, however, was quick to 
credit his friend for his success. HWhat 
has helped me the most this year has 
been having a good training partner. 
somebody to make me lift that much 
more and throw that much farther," 
he said. 

In other field action, a second 
Triton tandem was in search of dual 
All-American honors, this time in 
the pole vaull.But once agai n, UCSD 
could not claim that distinction. 

Creed Stacy, whose marks had 
been the better of the two Triton 
pole vaulters during the season, 
came up short in the finals,leaving 
teammate David Spector alone in 
the top eight. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Similar to Buehler and Lambert, 
Spector and Slary had been using 
one another as motivation through-
out the season. In Wednesday's pre-
liminaries, it appeared as though 
the duo would remain close. Both 
qualified at the height of 4.70 meters, 
a man: also reached by eight other 
competitors. 

In Friday's finals, however, Slary 
failed to clear the introductory height 
of 4.5Om. Specter, meanwhile, pro-
gressed to the same height he had in 
the preliminary-4.7 meters (I 5'5") 
- earning seventh-place and AII-
American status. 

The third Triton to grab AII-
American recognition in one of 
Friday's finals was Michaela 
Monahan. Monahan earned her berth 
in the 400m-hurdles final by scorch-
ing the track in Wednesday's pre-
liminaries, en route to a personal-
and school-record time of 62.02. 

In the finals, Monahan could not 
equal this feat, but her c10clcing of 
62.08 was speedy enough to gamer 
third place in the nation. 

UCSD repeated its Friday perfor-
mances during Saturday's finals as 
three more Tritonseamed AlI-Ameri-
can status. Two of those recipients 
came from the 5,OOOm race, a titlc 
which was being defended by 

UCSD's own I.J. Castner. 
In the final race of his Triton 

career, Castner was unable to recap-
ture the 5,OOOm crown. The Triton 
star did not miss the mark by much, 
however,asheedgoooutJohn Weigel 
of host North Central College 
(14:40.62) in a tight finish to take 
third in a time of 14:40.30. 

Castner, too, had familiar com-
pany in the race, as teammate Gavin 
Klinger managed to claim the last 
All-American spot by coming 
across the line in eighth place. 

The final Triton to be named as an 
All-American was junior hurdler Lisa 
Shepard. Her role was significantly 
reduced going into nationals, as a 
result of an untimely sprained ankle 
that occurred in a "freak" accident 
during a hurdles drill last week. 

The coaches decided to hold 
Shepard out of the triple jump - an 
event he would surely have con-
tended in as well. They felt it was not 
worth the risk of she being unable to 
compete in the 100m hurdles, an 
event that would be less strenuous on 
her tender ankle. 

Actually, Shepard was un ure 
that she would be able to perform 
in ei ther event.

first time since injuring it," Shepard 
said. ''The hardesI part was not the 
pain, but the apprehension of not 
wanting to fall again." 

As it turned out. Shepard per-
formed admirably, qualifying in the 
number-four position with a time of 
14.57 seconds in Thursday's prelimi-
nary heat. Just prior to Saturday's 
final. she experienced another scare. 
as he was unable to find hcrassigned 
number and was in danger of missing 
the start of the race. 

However, a number was quickly 
given to her, and she hit the track. 

"I think that kind of helped be-
cause it distracted me from the race," 
Shepard said. 

Once in her lane, Shepard showed 
no sign of nerves, running neck-and-
neck with the leaders before finiShing 
in third place,just fi ve one-hundredths 
of a second out or the lead. Hertime 
of 14.30 seconds was a substantial 
improvement on thepreli mi nary time. 
and it caught herself and her coaches 
by surprise. 

"I was surprised and very pleased 
with [my time in the finals)." 
Shepard said. "You can say I 
could 've done thi or that, but I did 
the best I could. I figured, what the 
heck, I've got nothing to lose, it 's 
my last race of the year."

18 SPORTS 

MLS: Will the 
United States' new 
league be a success? 
Continued from pace 20 

Such fruitless endeavors aside, 
soccer has traditionally had a weak 
and often laughable reputation in the 
United States. American spons fans 
complain of its low scores and boring 
pace, readily dismissing its position 
as the world's number-one sport. 
These are the people who rooted for 
the MLS to fail- perhap5 to justify 
their own sports priorities. or perhaps 
to prevent the United States from par-
ticipating in a sport where it is clearly 
inferior to the rest of the world. 

Naturally, critics pointed out that 
first-game auendance will always be 
high, due to the attraction of a new 
league. The true test of a league's 
potential success comes with the sec-
ond game and in games down the 
road. 

But second-game attendance 
around the 1eaguestill averaged above 
17.000. This was well beyond the 
conservati ve estimates of leam own-
ers. who predicted that the turnstiles 
would notch no more than 12.000 
fans. And while /IOl all MLS fran-
chises have drawn as well as Los 
Angeles'. 25,000 people at a soccer 
game in any United States city is 
remarkable. 

.... 

The UCSD Guardian 
, -1 ) - • 

Tuesday. May 28. 1996 

'These wqe the obstacles that the 
MLS, and all past American soccer 
leagues, faced when starting out. ini-
tially, however. the MLS had one 
distinct advantage: 'The country was 
still abuzz about the World Cup roar-
ing through in 1994, giving MLS of-
ficials hope that this would spad a 
nationwide interest in the spon. 

What, then, has made the MLS so 
much more successful than past 
leagues? Manny Motajo, a Galaxy 
defender who played in two defunct 
soccer leagues in the United States. 
the CISL and USISL. cited one aspect 
which separates the MLS from the 
failures: ''There is a big difference 
because in this league we have a lot of 
experienced players who have played 
the game before and have played a 
long time. So you can' t compare it to 
any other league. And it will continue 
to grow, because it's a strong league 
and everybody wants to play in it." 

Galal .... : Fan support for MLS has exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic. 

But mismanagemenl and bad lim-
ing prevented the MLS from begin-
ning play unti I this Apri I, nearly two 
years after soccer fever reached its all-
time peale in the United States. 

Mostcritics said the failure to ca~­
talize on American interesl in soccer 
was sure to doom the league. But 
69,000 people felt otherwise on open-
ing (j;ly in Los Angeles, and they sent 
a message to league officials thai soc-
cer fans do exist here. en masse. All 
they've been waiting for is a league 
with respectable players and leader-
ship. League Commissioner Doug 
Corbell agreed, noting that "[We] 
underestimated the pent-up demand 
for soccer." 

~ Indeed, teams have secured big 
names to play in the MLS. When 
Mexican star and national hero Jorge 
Campos signed last year with the 
Galaxy as goalkeeper, a run started on 
major talent which ultimately netted 
several other big-name foreigne.rs: 
Carlos Valderrama from Columbia, 
Marco Etcheverry from Bolivia, Cle 
Kooiman ftom Holland and Roberto 
Donadoni from Italy. 

Players from abroad lend a cenain 
amount of credibility to the league, 

assuring fans that thequality of play is 
good enough to attract some of the 
best players from countries that actu-
ally know soccer. 

Still, teams in the MLS are limited 
to four foreign players per squad. in a 
wise effon to rnalce this an American 
league thai will help build American 
players and American soccer. Too 
many foreigners would simply give 
the impression of a rented league from 
overseas. Moreover, vinually all mem-
bersofthe U.S. National Team signed 
with teams in the MLS, which con-
firms that this league intends to be 
taken seriously. 

Leftover World Cup hype has even 
made international stars out of some 
American players, notablyCobi Jones, 

Alexi LaJas. John Harkes and Eric 
Wynalda. 1be increased exposure 
during the World Cup netted these 
stars contracts in Europe and else-
where. a major step in itself for Amen-
can soccer. 

But even more important was con-
vincing these top American soccer 
stars that the MLS could offerthem an 
equally fruitful career in the States. 
For years. American soccer players 
had dreamed of getting a chance to 
play in Europe. Now, the best of the 
American crop had returned to help 
builda respectable league in the United 
States. 

MLS owners also employed stra-
tegic placement of players, practicing 
a form of cooperative managing that 

previous leagues lacked. Instead of 
competing against one another, teams 
equally distributed the top players and 
placed them in the appropriate cities. 
Jorge Campos wound up in Los An-
gekls along with countryman Mauricio 
Cienfuegos - unk.nown to most 
Americans, but a hero in Mexico - to 
tap into the massive HispanicJLatino 
community. 

The ploy has worked. lntheteam's 
most recent game agai nst Kansas City, 
the success of the player alignment 
was obvious: Behind the Galaxy's 
goal,fan dressed themselvesinCam-
pos' traditional bright yellow and 
cheered maddeningly whenever his 
name was announced. When Campos

DELIRIOUS 
IV AN DELVENTHAL 

Bad as He 
Wants to Be 

I should hate him. I really 
should. 

Every ounce of common 
sense would have me despise 
him. Butl have a confession to 
make. I love Dennis Rodman. 

Now don't get me wrong. I 
have no desire whatsoever to 
participate ill any of Rodman 's 
off-court fantasies - like the 
ones he's repeatedly described 
in interviews and now in his 
new book, Bad as I Wanna Be. 

lt's ju t t hat no mailer how 
hard I try to dislike the man 
they call "The Worm," no 
matter how much I try to let his 
personal life jade my view of 
him and convince me that he i 
a truly contemptible character, 
I just can'1. 

Let\ take the most recent 
example of hi s exploits, this 
time in the Eastern Conference 
finals. Rodman, a comparably 
lanky 6'8" forward weighing in 
at 210 pounds, embraced the 
seemingly daunting task of 
squaring up against the 7' I ", 
320-pound Shaquille O'Neal. 

' Now, let it be known that I 
have never been a great fan of 
the post game. I don 't get some 
unexplainable thrill from 
seeing big guys bang repeat-
edly against each other for 
position. Instead, I have spent 
my life relishing the soft-
handed, silky smooth, float-
through-the-lane, sumptuous 
play of guys like Michael 
Jordan and Penny Hardaway. 
But watching Rodman in the 
blocks bauling Shaq is a sight 
at which I cannot help but 
marvel. 

During the Bulls' four-game 
h s~eep of the Magic, which was 

completed yesterday, Rodman 
showed us all that he wasn't 
going to let the bigger-than-life 
O'Neal outmuscle him. In the 
12 playoff games this year 
against the Heat, Knicks and 
Magic, Rodman has averaged 
13.3 rebounds per game. 

For those of you who might 
not know much about Rodman, 
or even for those of you who 
do, let me refresh your memory 
a bit about the history of this 
truly remarkable athlete. 

Rodman grew up in 
Trenton, New Jersey and 
graduated from high school 
measuring in at 5'11", without 
ever having played organiled 
basketball. 

One night, while working 
the graveyard shift as a janitor 
at the Dallas-Fort Worth 
Airport, Rodman finally 
decided he wanted to pursue 
the game of basketball. Since 
high school, Rodman had 
sprouted eight inche and 
thought he'd give the game a 
try. After all, the Wonn's two 
sisters were both All -American 
basketball players. 

So he enrolled at Cooke 
County Junior College in 
Texas and eventually trans-
ferred to Southeastern Okla-
homa State. In his three

SUCCESS 
WHAT 

THE MLS 
HAS 

DONE 
TO 

ENSURE 
ITS 

SUCCESS 
IN THE 

SOCCER-
STARVED 

U.S. 

Star power: Recognized talents such as Cobi Jones (13) are one reason 
that Major League Soccer Is already outperforming its predecessors. 

t was like 69,000 slaps in the 
face. Every single person who 
showed up for the Los Angeles 
Galaxy 's home opener for 

Major League Soecer (MLS) on 
April 13 was effectively telling the 
millions of doubters in this country 
that soccer will survive. 

Even MLS officials expected no 
more than 25,000 to be in atten-
dance at the Rose Bowl for the 
Galaxy's debut against the New 
YorklNew Jersey Metro Stars, and 
naysayers scoffed at that figure. A 
walk-up crowd of more than 30,000 
helped anchor the raucous, festive 
total of 69,000, which showed the 
world that this time, soccer just 

might work in the United States. 
Even more promising than the 

opening-day attendance totals was 
the 25,231 people who showed up 
Sunday for a mid-SCilSOn Galaxy 
game against the Kansas City Wiz. 
Novelty and promotion can often 
guarantee a big opening crowd, but 
only a genuine product can bring in 
over 25,000 people to a random 
Sunday afternoon game in the 
middle of May. 

An impressive 2-0 victory by 
the Galaxy over Kansas City fur-
ther legitimized soccer in Southern 
Califomia, proving that the MLS 
has taken the proper steps in form-
ing this fledgling league. 

In the first place, soccer's un-
successful history in the United 
States provided an initial roadblock 
to forming MLS. All the numerous 
leagues and attempts at leagues have 
failed in the past, including the vari-
ous indoor leagues, such as the 
M1SLand CISL. These Jeaguessaw 
limited succesS in the 1980s but 
never won a following large enough 
to warrant expansion or increased 
sponsorship. 

Only the late North American 
Soccer League drew substantial 
crowds. but that folded over 10 
years ago after losing its respected 
players and, hence, its credibility.

Six Tritons 
Crowned All-
Americans 
At Nationals 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

For a select group of UC San 
Diego track-and-field athletes, the 
season did not end two weeks ago at 
the California and Nevada State 

Champion-
ships. 

In tead, for 
this small con-
tingent of Tri-
tons, a trip to 
Naperville, III., 
and the Divi-

sion rn National Championships till 
lay ahead. And for six of those UCSD 
athlete in attendance, the trip ended 
in All-American recognition. 

Perhaps the most surpri sing 
achievement of the four-day cham-
pionship meet for UCSD was the 
third-place showing of senior Randy 
Buehler in the hammer throw. His 
finish was by far the best of 
Buehler' s UCSD career. 

In his previous two trips to the 
NCAA championships, the Triton 
strong-man had fouled out and fin-
ished 14th. As it turned out, Buehler 
surprised even himself with the 
showing. 

"I was hoping to finish in the 
top-eight, maybe the top-six," 
Buehler said. "I was not expecting 
to finish third. That was a little bit 
out of my imagination." 

Buehler accomplished this feat 
by pulling off two tremendous 
throws, each of which bettered his 
previous personal record by almost 
eight feet. The first of these throws 
came in the preliminaries and trav-
eled 179'S". With thattoss, Buehler 
easily qualified for Friday's finals, 
which were plagued by rain. 

However, after two average 
throws, Buehler once again came 
up big, hurling the ball-and-chain a 
distance of 179' 5". 

"The rainy conditions were bad, 
but it doesn' t really affect your 
throwing [so much as it] plays with 
you mentally," Buehler said. "But

Methodist Charges, Tritons Skid' tQ Third 
NCAAs: UCSD was unable to hold onto first place as Skidmore and Methodist passed the Tritons on 
the final day of the NCAA Division III National Golf Championships in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

The final outcome was practically 
set in stone. The only question was 
how would that outcome be reached. 

The answer came from the Meth-
odist Monarchs, two-time defending 
national golf champions who shot an 
incredible one-under par 287 on the 
final day to claim their third straight 
Division III title at Saratoga Springs, 
N.Y., last weekend. 

UCSD, which led the 23-team field 
going into the final round on Friday, 
fini hed third behind host Skidmore 
College. 

The Monarchs - winners for the 

sixth time in seven years - totaled a 
1184 over the 72-hole event. Skidmore 
(1186), UCSD (1193), John Carroll 
Univer ity (1 194) and 
CnrthageCollege ( 1204) 
rounded outlhe top five. 

UCSD had moved 
into first place after 
Thursday' third-round 
coreof292 (888 total), 

two shot ahead of 
Skidmore (890). Meth-
odist seemed out of the 
titJe hunt after a di as-
trous day on the link , fini hing the 
third round with a score of 306 for a 
three-day total of 897, nine shots be-

hind the Tritons. 
UCSD's total of292 for Thursday 

included two even-par 72 perfor-
mances from enior 
Hunt Cairns and junior 
Brian Bazzel. Junior 
ArnieCampbell' 73so-
lidified the Tri tons ' 
standing going into the 
last day. 

"One of the critical 
points in the tournament 
was that Methodist 
dropped to fifth place 

after Thursday ' round," Triton Head 
Coach Mike Wydra said. "We had 
played with them throughout the 

champion hips, and we' re a very an-
noying team for them to play with. 
But because they were in fifth place 
heading into Friday, the, started 50 
minutes before us, while we played 
with the top three teams." 

'This i not to take anything away 
from them," Wydra said. ''They played 
a super round. We certainly didn't do 
'a Greg Norman,' but we definitely 
had a chance to win it. We needed to 
shoot a 296 to win it, and our 305 
score was not our be I." 

Prior to thi year, the Tritons had 
never led going into the final round of 
play at the national champion hips.
