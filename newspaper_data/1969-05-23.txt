UCSD is now entering the third 
day of a strike that was called 
by the students in an open as-
sembly Tuesday night. A large 
crowd, numbering about 800, 
crowded into the Revelle Cafe-
teria to discuss the appropriate 
reaction to the situation at Ber-
keley. Atter many speakers and 
speeches the crowd overwhelm-
ingly approved a strike, with 
more substantive demands to be 
formulated later. 

Wednesday night this body met 
again in the Revelle Cafeteria. 
This time the room was even 
more crowded, probably 1000 
persons. After consideration of 
various demands and proposals, 
two demands accompanied by a ' 
preamble were approved. These 
demands called for the withdra-
wal of all National Guard from 
the Berkeley community and of 
all outside police forces from the 
Berkeley campus. 

Wednesday at noon some 2000 
persons assembled in the gymna-
sium at a convocation called and 
chaired jointly by AS President 
Tom Shepard and Chairman of 
the Academic Senate Walter 
Munk. The speakers on the pro-
gram included Chancellor Mc-
Gill, Sheldon Schultz, Linus PauI-

ing, Herbert Marcuse, Angela 
Davis, .and Jeff Benjamin. 

Picketing and rallies ha ve been 
the order of the day in the Re-
velle plaza the last several days. 
By Thursday the teaching pro-
cess had nearly been brought 
to a haIt. Most classes were 
cancelled, half-empty, or wele 
discussing Berkeley and the 
strike. 

The Academic Senate Wednes-
day called for "the immediate 
withdrawal from the Berkeley 
campus off all National Guard 
and off-campus police." They 
also urged their colleagues "to 
devote all regular classes to a 
discussion of the events on the 
Berkeley campus." 

Dean Murphy stated that as long 
as the strike didn't involve co-
ercion or disruption of those 
classes that wished to meet, 
he knew of no violations of uni-
versity regulations. The me-
chanics of the strike are being 
coordinated by a Strike com-
mittee, the composition of which 
is otten in flux. An original 
committee was disbanded yester-
day and replaced by another of 
15 members elected by those pre-
sent in the plaza yesterday after-
noon. 

UC Santa Cruz 
it appears 'certain that Santa Cruz will join in the Monday and 

Tuesday boycott of classes, although there is some confusion con-
cerning the demands that have been agreed upon. The strike Co-
ordinating Committee there issued demands earlier in the week 
( printed in Strike Daily), but later reports indicate that, at a larger 
meeting of the general student body yesterday, new demands were 
formulated. 

A meeting of the Academic Senate is scheduled for Monday to 
discuss the strike. 

UC Davis 
At a rally held on the Davis 

campus yesterday students voted 
to join the university-wide boy-
cott currently scheduled for this 
coming Monday and Tuesday. 
About 2000 students gathered in 
the quad and more than half this 
numl.l'lr joined in a march !h to 
the administration building short-
1y after. 

Chance Hor-designate Meyers, 
who wUl replace the present 
Chancellor, who is leaving in 
July, addressed the students and 
presented proposals that related 
to various Davis issues, such as 
ethnic stUdies prognms, in ad-
dition to expressing their support 
for Berkeley. 

In the dialogue with Meyers : 
that followed his address, he 
finally took a stand' in support 
of the boycott of classe~. H'? 
also agreel1 to send a telegram 
to Chancellor Heyns at Berkeley 
asking that the National Guard be 
pulled out. 

A Steering Committee, consis-
ting of the AS PreSMr!lll, A~J le 
editor, and representatives of 
other campus groups such as 
BSU and SDS, planned yester-
day's rally and will co-ordinate 
.next week's boycott. 

The Legislative Assembly, the 
student governing body, met last 
night to discuss the issue. The 
Davis Academic Senate meets 
today. 

UC Irvine 
On Wednesday students on the Irvine campus wanted to lower the 

flag to half-mast and to have classes called off on Monday. The 
administration declined to grant either, stating, according to AP News 
SerVice, that "only one student was killed in Berkeley." 

The Freedom Fighters and the American Legion threatened to 
come on campus if the flag was lowered; one member did and got 
in a fight with a student. 

At a noon rally yesterday som 500 persons, according to an L.A. 
Times estimate, voted to strike. An official conclave has been called 
by the administration for 10:00 a.m. today. 

UC Santa Barbara 
A rally attended by 1500 to 

2000 students was held on the 
Santa Barbara campus yester 1ay 
momlng. Although no reIn de-
cision was reached, the general 
fee ling of those present seem d to 
be in support of a two day boy-
cott of classes next MondlY and 
Tuesday, and a march into Sant-l 
Bar n,Â· j, for informational pur-

poses. 
The Chancellor has called for a 

convocation today and has call d 
off classes after 3:00 p.m. H 
has also sent a telegram to U 
President Charles Hitch askinl 
hi In to re move the troops from the 
Berkeley area, and has asked th 
faculty to discuss the tssu s 
in their classes OOay.

Eight Receive Year's Probation 
The fate of the eight stu-

dents implicated in the blockade 
of the Marine recruiter on Feb-
ruary 21 w s revealed by Chan-
cellor McGill this week. In a 
letter to each of the students 
the Chancellor announced that he . 
was prepared to accept the 
findings of the Committee on stu-
dent Conduct and their recom-
mendation for discipline. 

Enclosed with the let ~r from 
the Chancellor were copies of 
the report from the Committee on 
student Conduct, a minority re-
port from the Committee chair-
man Dr. George Backus, and a 
letter from one of the sudents 
which qualified his position even 
though he had concurred with the 
majority. 

The majority of the Committee 
found that the eight students 
"were present on the steps ... with 
the intent of blocking the access 
to that building for Captain Stout, 
a Marine recruiter ... and that the 
attempt at blockage was suc-
cessful. " Beyond that the Com-
mittee found this conduct violated 
Sections 3 and 11 of the Univer-
Standard of Conduct. 

These sections define mis-
conduct as: "obstruction or dis-
ruption of teaching, research, 
administration, ... University ac-
tivities, including its public ser-
vice functions .. . It; and "failure 
to comply with directions of Uni-
versity officials acting in the 
performance of their duties. " 

The diSCiplinary actions re-

UC Berkeley 
, Berkeley was the scene of mass 

arrests today; at least 300 per-
sons were arrested by the after-
noon. National Guardsmen and 
observations helicopters were 
very much in evidence, but there 
was relatively little tear-gassing 
during the day. 

Another confrontation occur-
red when several thousand stu-
dents symbolically attempted to 
carry soil to the top of an AS 
co-op parking lot structure to 
build a park. Sheriff Madigan, 
who earlier stated that he was 
going "to bust anything that was 
attempted, " quickly sealed off the 
area. 

Outside of this, most demon-
strators stayed in the Sathe r 
Gate and Sproul Hall area. Most 
of the stores in the surrounding 
area were closed. 

KSDT reporters Steve Clark, 
Jim Johnson, and Dian Smith 
reported num~rous beatingsdur-
ing the day. Clark and Smith 
narrowly escaped the pOlice, but 
Johnson is thought to be in jail, 
as is ASUC President-elect Dan 
Segal. The ASUC is desparately 
trying to raise the $10,000 in 
bail necessary and is soliCiting 
contributions from all campuses. 

Meanwhile, various and sundry 
police are guarding the fenced-
in People 's Park. 

UC Los Angeles 
On the UCLA campus students 

are currently trying to d cide 
what cours of action to take 
after having occupied the admin-
istration building, Murphy Hall, 
for ')I)rn~ ~we l 'l ~ hours. Atter 
a nooll rJ.lly Wednesday, students 
moved toward the hall anc1 some 
1200 crowded inside the bUilding. 

However, all persons wer al-
lowed to enter and leave, and 
no attempt was mad to disrupt 
the normal business. The ad-
ministration stated that .ts 111ng 
as students conduct d themselves 
in this manllt>r '10 r'!Jrl;.ll ions

At 11:00 a.m. Thursd y, the 
students em rg and r grouped 
in Royc quad to discuss m tters 

with BSU and Coalition members. 
An Acallemic Senate meeting was 

scheduJ~d for 2:00 p. m. and many 
student crowded into the meeting 
or listened to th audio set-up 
in the quad. Some 600 faculty

and appeared to be almost evenly 
divided on supportinganyboy,~ Lt. 

The inauguration of Chancellor 
Young is schedul for today.:md 
he had previously c ncelled all

was probation, until June, 1970, 
and was accepted by the Chan-
cellor. The students had until 
May 22 to appeal any of the 
findings or recommendations of 
the Committee. Having not hear 1 
any reply by that da e the Chan-
ce llor will assu me that th Y wai ve 
appeal and he will formally accept 
the advice of the Committee by 
placing the eight students on one 
year's probation. 

STRIKE 
The Strike made several im-

portant decisions at a meeting 
called last night at 6: 30 by the 
new Strike Committee. The 
meeting attended by about 500 
strikers, began with information 
reports from other campuses and 
a statement by President Hitch. 

Then Craig Starr asked for 
striker support for a proposal 
that each of the UC's send a 
100 member faculty-student de l-
egation to Sacramento to present 
our demands to GovernorReagan. 
The proposal would be worked 
through the Associated Students. 
He got that support. 

Linus Pauling again talked to 
us, putting the strike into an 
entire social/moral context. 

The proposal to move Berkeley 
students, faculty, and class s to 
th oth r UC campuses until hhe 
National Guard and police are 
kick d off Berkeley was d feated 
after extended d bate. 

Another significant vote was to 
nonviolently d monstrate by for-
cing th Marine recruiter to pass

Dear Editor: 
The letter criticizing the bias 

of the Academic Senate meeting 
article was perhaps quite justi-
fied. Howeve r, I would like to 
point out that by-lined articles 
do not necessarily reflect the 
views of the paper. Further-
more, the intent of the artic Ie 
was to project the general mood 
of the students. These meetings 
provided a rare opportunity for 
good faculty-studentcommunici-
tion on important issues and the 
faculty conduct could hardly be 
called commendable. 

Perhaps a little jolt would 
induce the faculty to seek out 
better student relations. 

Sincerely, 
Paul Emus 

Students in Season 
The vast majority of students on this campus indicated unequivo-

cally last Wednesday their support for the demands that police and 
troops be removed from Berkeley and the reign of terror Instlgat~ 
by the Governor ended. 

We must realize that what has been occurring at Berkeley is nothing 
less than naked political oppression. The police have fired upon 
an unarmed crowd of people. The police have dropped noxious gasses 
from helicopters onto the Berkeley campus. They have beaten by-
standers and newsmen. The Governor has applauded this mrmrism. 

As Linus Pauling said at the Wednesday Convocation, "We are 
tired of sending telegrams to those In power begging for justice.' 
There is no such thing as rational discussion with those having a 
vested interest in exploiting people. Reagan has seized upon the park 
issue as a subterfuge &signed to increase his support among voters 
In his bid for re-election. That people have been killed and maimed 

Iby this does not bother him. 
However, the pU'blic outrage generated by thi::; terrorism indicates 

that his actions may have backfired. 
Every campus of the University of California is either striking 

or holding massive demonstrations to protest the police violence in 
Berkeley. Many state colleges have done likewise. 

The secretaries employed at Berkeley are on strike. 
The Academic Senate at Berkeley has voted to close down. 
Parents of Berkeley students have joined in the demonstrations. 
A Berkeley citizens' committee is demanding the removal of Na-

tional Guardsmen, outside pOlice, and the reinstatement of the 
Peoples ' Park. 

Many National Guardsmen threw down their arms rather than con-
tinue the violence. 

The Chancellor of UC Davis, Dr. Meyers, has publicly proclaimed 
his support of the strike at Davis. 

Such unilateral action demands our continued support. 
We must strike until Berkeley can breathe again. 
There are certain dangers which must be guarded against in order 

to sustain the momentum of the strike. It appears at this writing 
that we have failed to develop a leadership which people can follow. 
This fact was manifested at the meeting Wednesday night. The group 
"in charge" was unable to either maintain unity or expedite the business 
on the agenda. The endlessly repetititve speakers were detrimental 
to the proceedings. 

We feel that a reorganization of the Executive Committee is im-
perative. We suggest that it be constituted of at least 25 members, 
and that its meeting be open. Further, this committee should be 
empowered to make certain decisions, subject to review by the groups 
as a whole. 

Until such changes are made, he strike is in danger o( succumbing 
to all the usual mll.ladieswhich afflict student movements.

UCLA last Friday â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 
Regents Hassled 
at UCLA. Meeting 

Last Friday's Regents meeting 
was perhaps the most tumultuous, 
comparing only with the Santa 
Cruz meeting Â· of last October. 
students succeeded in forcing the 
Regents to clear the room and re-
cess for near ly a hall- hour before 
they could continue with their 
business. 

Nearly two-thirds of the 100 
observers allowed into the meet-
ing were members of Coalition, 
with a few members of right-
wing organizations present. Im-
mediately upon Chairman Higgs' 
gaveling the meeting to order 
Lou Donaldson of the Coalition 
rose to demand that the Regents 
let him speak. 

only "yes" vote. 
The Regents went into a five-

minute recess, the Coalition took 
a vote, and when the Regents went 
back to order, the students chan-
ted, "We want to speak." The 
meeting continued with frequent 
interruptions until Hitch decided 
to order that the room be cleared. 

One student was ejected for-
cibly and finally Chancellor 
Young addressed the galleries: 

"No one regrets doing this more 
than I, but you must leave." 
The Regents recessed and the 
sheriff could be heard repeating, 
"I hereby declare this an illegal 
assembly; everyone except Re-
gents, their guests, and the press 
must leave,' 

Oufside f6e Regents leefing.

Higgs informed Donaldson tbat 
there were "proper procedures" 
for making such an address in-
volving prior written requests. 
Higgs asked for a motion to 
wave the rules and Regent Dutton 
made such a motion. He com-
mented: "I've criticized for 
a long time the failure of the 
Board to receive stUdent com-
ment. But as to interruptions, 
you're damn fools (the students) 
if you think this will get you 
what you want." IiI the voting

The students tinally did leave 
and the Regents eventually got 
down to business, Which was not 
much. They only item of in-
terest was a discussion of the 
situation concerning People's 
Park, with UCB Vice-Chancel-
lor Chiedt presenting the ad-
ministration's case. Finally the 
Regents finally passed some sort 
of resolution supportlng the hand-
ling of the administration and 
]aw enforcement officials. 

BY STEVE LANDAU 
It is becoming increasingly dllficult for the 

Regents of the University of California to conduct 
their business in their monthly meetings on the 
various UC campuses. 

student interest in Regents meetings began near 
the end of the last school year, when the Regents 
were discussing tuition; disturbances have occurred 
at nearly every meeting this year. 

Last week's meeting at UCLA might just well 
be the last one on a UC campus; it will at least 
be the last without the continuous presence of the 
police forces. 

As the Regents attempted to convene their open 
session inside the Faculty Center on the UCLA 
campus last Friday, a crowd whose numbers ranged 
between 1000 and 2000 gathered at the various 
entrances to the building. banged on walls and 
windOWS, ran across the roof. and finally kaced 
the combined forces of campus security guards, 
LAPD, and Highway Patrolmen in tactical man-
euvers. 

A rally had been called for 12:45 p.m. by the 
Coalition, an umbrella organization for various 
campus activist groups. A crowd began to gather 
in the quad about haifa block away from the Faculty 
Center and was entertained by the Guerilla theatre. 

Shortly belore 1:30 p.m., when the Regents meet-
ing was to convene, they moved to the parking 
lot and street adjacent to the building. As the 
confrontation inside between the Regents and Coali-
tion members among the 100 observers allowed 
in continued, chants of "ROTC off campus" from 
the crowd outside were quite audible to the Regents. 

From the time when the observers were ejected 
from the meeting, matters quickly escalated. The 
police were able to hold most of the portions of the 
building's exterior. but on the east side students 
surged forward and started pounding on the walls 
and windows of the chamber in which the Regents 
were meeting. 

The efforts of one cop to direct a water sprinkler 
onto students scaling the ice plant-covered slopes 
proved more humorous than effective, although 
the men in blue (and gray and black) were later 
able to regain their sUlmiority in this strategic 
area. Some damage wa ; done to the walls here 
and five plate glass win10ws were smashed in a 
faculty lounge in anoth ~r part of the building. 

After order was restored inside the building and 
the meeting resumed, fu.-ther confrontations were 
limited to minor skirmis:\el> In front olthe building. 
One student was arrested after he staged an im-
promptu sit-in on the :oottop, as was another 
girl. 

During the course of U'e day. two students were 
arested according to offlctal police reports. One 
student was booked on Euspicion of assaulting an 
otficer and another on suspicion of trespass ing 
and reSisting arrest. 

By the time the meeting had ended and Reagan 
was holding his second press conference of the 
day in the north end of the building, the sound oC 
police pursuing demonstrators across the rooftop 
made his comments almost In~udiblp. 

As Reagan and the Regents attempted theIr 
exit, around 4:00 p.m., the crowd surged back and 
forth trying to find their cars, but were re-
strained by the police. Finally, the Regents were 

in their cars and ready to go, but one minor 
hang-up developed-they had forgotten the keys 
to the cars. This was taken care of and the Regents 
made their getaway. -

Meanwhile, inside the building. UCLA Chan-
cellor Young and the campus potlce were directing 
police operations. Initially a force of some 50 
campus policemen were present, contingents having , 
been flown in from Santa Barbara. R1verside. and 
San Diego. After a load of helmets had been brought 
in, the police were equipped in full battle regella, 
but Young wanted more help. He called in the 
LAPD, and atter a considerable deIaytheyarrived-
70 of them-with a contingent ot 30 Highway Patrol-
men (numbers according to a L.A. police ser-
geant), making a total force of 170 men in uniform. 

Persons milling around the parking lot just 
outside the press entrance were greeted, at about 
4:20 p.m., with the sight of an advancing column 
ot some 30 LAPD, nightsticks drawn. Thus began 
the numerous police movements that continued 
for nearly an hour. 

About 10 minutes later a panicked crowd stam-
peded down the street at the sight of advancing 
forces, several columns deep (followed by a police 
van) whose purpose was to clear the immediate 
area in front of the Faculty Center. 

student maneuvers were directed by bullhorn 
and the crowd regrouped in the quad alter the 
cops had cleared the street and taken up positions 
along the sidewalk. After several other complicated 
maneuvers the police withdrew about a hundred 
yards. One campus policeman, when asked about 
the logic behind the police tactics commented, " I 
really don't know; I've never seen anything like 
this.' 

Throughout most of the police confrontation, the 
Camiliar cry "pigs off campus" was heard, but 
at this point the Bruin spirit reared Its head. The 
demonstrators chanted "push 'em back, push 'em 
back, way back," and "go, Bruins." All in all, 
this more or less typified the mood of the crOWd, 
with bongos setting the beat throughout the after-
noon. The police were also more restrained than 
has otten been the case; at least their action did 
not escalate as at Berkeley to tear gas and 
beatings. 

Some cars In the area were damaged-mainly 
dented roofs that resulted from persons trying 
to get a better vantage point from which to view 
the action. One car was turned sideways in the 
street and used as a baricade for a while. 

Taking into account the peculiar character of 
tne UCLA campus, it was a most extraordinary 
day. Many of UCLA's 27,000 students are commut-
ers and the campus has gained the nickname "the 
factory." From talking to persons beforehand. the 
general Impression was that no mass student 
action had or could come off really well at UCLA. 
Furthermore, in-fighting between radical groups 
had destroyed the necessary unity in the past. 
and this rally was the real test for the Coalition, 
which was only formed this year and has not yet 
been too elfective. 

From the viewpoint at the Coalition, as ex-
pressed at a meeting after things had quieted down, 
the day was a success. Certainly what had hap-
pened during the course of last Friday was a new 
experience for the campus sprawled In the midst 
Of plush Westwood Village.

All-Cal Intramural. 
Attest Triton 'Skill' 

Last weekend, May 16-1S, UC 
SD participated in the seventh 
annual All-Cal Sport Festival 
held at UCSB. 
Some 336 students from the eight 
UC campuses competed. All 
competition was round robin. UC 
SD did very well considering the 
calibre of competition they laced. 

We were not one of the top 
four schools in the eight-school 
gettogether. However the Tri-' 
tons did do we 11 in such areas 
as women's tenniS, in which Vicki 
Hogan and Sandy Bille place 
third. Women's basketball was 
really a gasser, as was women's 
volleyball. The girls really gave 
their all in these two team ac-
tivities. 

Men's team competition was 
hurt by the lack of a Triton 
lotramural soccer team. The 
volleyball was as well as could 
be expected, since the team mem-
bers had had no chance to work 
together. Men's tenoiswonsome 
and lost some. Fred McClair 
and Dennis Murry, the tennis re-
presentatives for the school, both 
played well. 

In badminton Suda Rangnekar 
was the only male participating, 
and he played well against some 
real fine competition. The full 
r esults of this event will not 
be available until the summary 
sheet is sent out by UCSB. 

Co-ed softball, which we really 
hoped to win, got out of control 
when the Tritons encountered 
"Woman Power"--the girl PE 
majors of other schools, that is. 
Women's badminton did ex-

tremly well for two girls that 
were brought hogether in 
the hours before leaving for UC 
SB. Edith Whitlock and Kathie 
Hoffer were the very fine 
women's badminton players for 
UCSD. 

lotramurals at UCSD: 

Changing the subject back to 
the everyday world of in-
tramurals around campus, one 
notices that men's softball is now 
in full swing. The Toledo Mud-
hens of C league lead the field 
with a 4-0 record. No jone else 
has compiled such a record thus 
far--perhaps if we wait until 
the other teams have played four 
games the picture might change. 

Men's qater lp;p os gpomg 
slowly, us according to the in-
formation sheet there has been 
no action at all. Threeman 
basketball has been quite popular 
with most of the gym crowd late-
ly. Games are played almost 
every night of the week. Lea-
ders of each league will be posted 
as soon as all teams have re-
ported in the results of their 
games. 

Co-ed softball pIa yofts are still 
in the second round, but - they 
are heading into the third round 
as this week ends. One game 
will be replayed under protest 
after having gone ten innings, due 
to some alleged miskudgments bu 
the umpire. This was a real 
hot game and will be played ugain 

Sunday at 12:00.
