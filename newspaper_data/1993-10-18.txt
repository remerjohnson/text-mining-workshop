in the 

UC President Jack Peltason looks back at a 
challenging year and looks ahead to the future 

4. II eyes were focused on Jack Peltason as he rose to speak in UCLA's Royce Hall 
on that October afternoon a year ago. 
To those in attendance, this was more 
than just a run-of-the-mill meeting of 
the University of California Board of 
Regents. In the midst of its 125th 
anniversary, the university found it-
self in a precarious position. Every-
one in Royce Hall seemed to sense 
that, but no one more than Peltason 
himself. 

Just a few moments earlier, 
Peltason had been inaugurated as the 
16th President of the University of 
California. Now, as he addressed the 
'crowd for the first time as president, 
'Peltason came straight to the point. 

"Never has the university been 
stronger," he said. "And never has it

As Peltason addressed the crowd, 

approximately 1,000 student protest-
ors planted crosses in front of Royce 
Hall and then lay down in front of 
them. "We want the media to see that 
we are being murdered," said UCLA' 
student Hope McCarthy. ''This is not 
a spectator sport. This is our educa-
tion." 

Both Peltason and the student pro-
testors were aware of the situation 
facing the university - state funding 
to the UC system had plummeted since 
California's economic slump began 
in 1991. 

The university was already facing 
a $225 million deficit and another 10 
percent funding cut in January, 1993. 
Student fees had skyrocketed to over 
$3,000 per year, double the amount

Che Cafe 
Dispute 
Continues 
eMP: Former member 
trades allegations with 
campus vegetarian 
restaurant collective 
By Philip Michaels 
News Editor 

The war of words between the 
Che Cafe and a former collective 
member escalated this week a 
representati ves from both sides 
levied charges and counter-charges 
at one another. 

Jim Stephens, who joined the 
Che collective in September of 
1992, has alleged that the vegetar-
ian restaurant has violated the 
Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) between the co-ops, the 
student government, and the ad-
ministration . Stephens said he fre-
quently warned the collective 
members that they were violating 
university policies. 

"As soon as I tried to appeal to 
them to change the situation, J be-
came the black knight and some-
one for everyone to aim their darts 
at," said Stephen s, who wa 
"decored," or removed as a mem-
ber, from theChe collective in July. 

Collective members, however, 
said that Stephens was decored 
not for his criticism of the Che 
Cafe, but because he didn't fit in 
with the collective, 

"He wasn 't fulfilling his re-
sponsibilities here, so we decided 
ifhe's not going to be working at 
the shifts, we should restrict his 
kitchen access," said collecti ve 
member Doug Cronyn, who al-
leged that Stephens often missed 
his assigned lunch shifts. 

Stephens maintains (hat he per-
formed all hi s dutie at the Che in

Thought, an organization which

A.S. Reviews Funding Options Mter Court's Smith Ruling 
By Elaine Camuso 
Associate News Editor 

Members of the Associated Stu-
dents, student organizations and 
university administrators met last 
Thursday to discuss possible strat-
egies for complying with the Cali-
fornia State Supreme Court ruling 
on Smith v. Regents, which was 
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 
two weeks ago. 

The court ruled that mandatory 
student fees cannot be allocated to 
student organizations in which 
political, ideological or religious 
activities outweigh educational 
benefits. At present, UCSD has 18 
student organizations which are 
defined as primarily religious and 

, five defined as primarily political 
in nature. The third category, ideo-

logical, is not yet clearly defined 
by the university. 

The UC Office of the Presi-
dent has offered the UC campuses 
five options for assessing fees. 
leaders and administrators from 
each campus will decide which 
option they prefer and make rec-
ommendations at an Oct. 27 
Chancellor's Meeting. 

At present, UCSD student lead-
ers and administrators would al-
low the $13.50 student activity fee 
to be collected as usual, but would 
prohibit all organizations defined 
os political, ideological or reli-
gious from drawing from those 
funds. According to A.S. Vice 
President Nick Endres, such an 
option would cause major prob-
lems between students, the A.S. 

and student organizations. 
"[The A.S. is] put in the posi-

tion where we have to determine 
what falls under this very vague, 
nebulous definition," he said. "All 
it takes is one student to say 'Wait 
a second, I think this organization 
is political, and it i getting funds, ' 
and then we might have a lawsuit 
on our hands." 

The issueofdefinition has been 
• remedied by the UC Office of the 
President, which released a draft 
of two proposed definitions for 
student organizations. The defini-
tions cover educational organiza-
tions and clubs which are reli -
gious, political or ideological in 
nature. A.S. President Carla Tesak 
said she believes these are clear

Lewis will assist UCSD' !i chap-

current main goal - amending 
the Clinton administration' s policy 
on logging in the Pacific Nonh-

The group objects to the pol icy 
because it does not protect at least 
40 percent of the Pacific 
Northwest' s ancient forests. 

CALPIRG favors a complete 
halt to logging in that area and is 
directing a postcard-writing cam-
paign at the White House. The

CALPIRG is also focusing its 
energies on the Endangered Spe-

An "All Species Day." spon-

if they did not wish to pay fees to 
CALPIRG. 

In 1990, the Board of Regents 
ruled that CALPIRG's funding 
method was improper and decep-
tive. 

According to Lewis. the fund-
ing program was suspended at the 
same time CALPIRG was sup-
porting the Big Green Initiative. 
which called for tighter restric-
tions on pesticides. 

An investigation by CALPIRG 
following the suspension indicated 
that many of the regents held 
stock in pesticide companies. 
Lewis said. 

CALPIRG has devised a new 
funding plan. which it hopes will 
be approved by students in the 
campus-wide election this spring. 
The group is currently collecting 
signatures to get the plan on the 
spri ng ballot. 

Since its return to the Uni versity 
of California. CALPIRG has been 
thriving on the Berkeley,SantaCruz 
and San Diego campuses.

Governor Signs Pipeline Project Bill 
Gov. Pete Wilson sJ&ned Into law legislation to 

enact Assembly Bill 266, the Mathematlcs. Science 
and TechnolOO Teacher PIpeline Project. The bill, 
sponsored by the University of Callfomia Student 
Association (UCSA) Is desl&Red to encourage stu-
dents to pursue careers In the teachIng profession by 
offering financial and academic support to elementary 
and cotlep-leYel students. 

"Given Callfornla's rapidly changing demograph-
Ics, recruItment of students of color into college Is of 
parsmount Importance." said Assemblywoman Mar· 
iuerlte ArchlHiudson, who authored AB 266. 

"The Pipeline Project will not only recruit 
underrepresented students, it will also train students 
to become teachers and role models back in their own 
community," Archle-Hudson added. 

WIth California's K·12 population expected to in-
crease by 69 percent by the year 2000. UCSA Presi-
dent Don Daves noted that the Pipeline Project would 
Increase the number of teachers available. "Pipeline 
Project centers will provide California with teachers 
during a time of scarcity on our elementary and high 
school campuses. particularly in urban areas,· Daves 
said. 

The Pipeline Project will be Implemented by grant· 
Ing • seed " money to local consortia consisting of 
elementary and secondary school districts, commu· 
nity colleges, universities and businesses. The Pipe-
line Project Is also Intended to provide loan assis· 
tance to college students to defray costs after gradu-
ation. 

"It was quite an accomplishment to get the legisla-
ture and the governor to commit funding to student 
recruitment during a time of extreme financial con-
straints," said UCSA Executive Director Andy Shaw. 

The total budget for seed grants is currently 
$125,000, a flgure which student leaders hope to 
Increase over the next few years to expand the· scope 
of the project.

governments in funding as many 
organizations as possible. 

"The advantage is that the ma-
jority of student organizations in 
existence would receive funding 
because you have to be extremely 
radical not to fall under the Office 
of the President's definition of 
educational." Tesak said. 

In addition. thi s opt ion would 
necessitate the formation of an A.S. 
board to determine which organi-
zations fit the definitions, which 
A.S. Vice President FinanceNeena 
Mal ik said would "add a huge bu-
reaucracy to the process." 

The other option being consid-
ered would allow one mandatory 
fee to be charged for all student 
government activities except po-
litical lobbying. and two volun-
tary fees - one for funding all 
student organizations and one for 
funding off-campus lobbying ac-
tivities undenaken by the A.S. 
Although this option would not 
force the A.S. to discriminate 
against some student organiza-
tions, student funding would be 
less reliable and less available than 
it was before the Smith decision. 

With the second option, stu-
dents would be asked to check off 
a box on their fee payment re-
ceipts if they wanted to pay the 
voluntary fees. a method which is 
called a positivecheck-off.ln light 
of the proposed fee increases and

PINION 

RNDING GENERATION 
COMMENTARY: More than just a commercial target for advertisers and the media, Generation X is 
slowly moving out of the baby boomers' shadow and establishing an identity for a youth culture that 
is no longer young 

DAVID 

~now 
Suddenly, we're the talk of the 

town . Statisticians fret about us. 
Marketing conventions are held to 
determine how to sell things to us. 
Employers worry about and feel 
sorry for us. The media gives us as 
much allention now as it does to 
Baby Shamu when he gets a cold. 

Yes, everyone agrees that Gen-
eration X has landed on the national 
consciousness and that we are cause 
for some serious discussion. But 
just who "we" are remains undeter-
mined, and it seems that the nebu-
lous term "Generation X" is being 
fa vored over more detai led attempts 
to understand American youth. 

The last definition I heard was 
that Generation Xers are those indi-
vidualsbombetween 19658nd 1975. 
This form of demarcation includes 
people age 18 to 28, but the term has 
been applied liberally to al most any-
one too young to have fought in 
Vietnam. 

For example, Daud and Con-

,"std, a film about high schoolers in 
1976, was .written by Richard 
linklater, who is in his late '30s. 
Various film cnics have called it the 
American Graffiti of Generation X, 
but 1976 is not my scene. In 1976 I 
couldn't yet understand the plot in-
tricacies of Flipptr. And yet, be-
cause the fi I m depicts the awkward 
growing-up years of people too 
young to be considered boomers, 
the tag "Generation X" is indiscrimi-
nately slapped on them. 

On top of this, the book that 
solidified the term in question, "Gtn-
eration X: Talesforan Acctluated

aimed primarily at people born as 
long ago as the late 50s. 

Undeniably, people now in their 
20s have much in common. But all 
too often. the only common identity 
positively attributed to us is that we 
are not baby boomers.

The labeling of American gen-
erations is a tricky business and, in 
my mind, was never worth much. 
But for a country as diverse and 
wide-open as ours, it lends some 
sense of belonging and unity, and is 
therefore interesting to those whose 
binhdays fall within the demarca-
tion dates. The '205 saw the emer-
gence of the so-called "lost genera-
tion" which was disillusioned with 
World War I and wanted to do noth-
ing else but hang out in speakeasies 
and part its hair in the middle. Then 
came the World War II generation, 
people like George Bush, who grew

up in the '305, fought in the War 
and came home convinced that 
America was God's gift to hu-
manity. Some mention is 
made of another genera-
tion, the name of which 
eludes me, that was too 
young to fight for 
World War II. and 
too old to hang 
with the 
boomers. Their 
other disgrace is that they never put 
anyone in the White House. 

Finally, we came to the post-war 
baby boom generation, the genera-
tion that has actually been watched 
since binh. This is also the genera-
tion that has celebrated itself like no 
other. This generation is so self-
absorbed that it didn't even notice 
the generation beneath it until people 
like Linklater began to tum 30. So it 
is not surprising that any evaluation 
of our generation would be defined 
completely by comparison to the 
baby boomers. 

For lack of a better tag, publica· 
tions such as Newsweek, the organ 
of all that booms, are calling us the 
post-baby boomers,oreven the baby 
busters. This is discouraging, be-
cause it defines us as the byproduct 
of another group of people. Butthere 
have been worse names. 

The"MTV generation" is degrad-
ing. It infers an apathy toward the 
real world, a willing neglect of the 
intellect and a dependence on sen-
sory overload. We don't have a mo-
nopoly on these traits. Hey, we'll be

"Slackers" isn't 
much better, either. This 
name was inspired by an earlier 
movie made by Linklater about col-
lege students in Austin, Texas, who 
spent two hours in front ofthe cam-
era skillfully doing nothing. The 
movie itself actually portrayed the 
college students as intelligent and 
concerned with life's mysteries. But 
the word "slacker," when applied to 
millions of young people, confirms 
our elders' worst stereotypes of our 
generation. 

Probably because of the diffi-
culty of figuring out what defines 
our generation, the label "genera-
tion X" has stuck, but it sti II carries 
a very negative connotation. 

The X implies hopelessness as 
much as it implies vagueness. The 
most interesting thing about this la-
bel is the enthusiasm with which 
many young people have adopted it 
as their own.

COMMENTARY: The fonner Soviet Union's tunnoils are extremely underemphasized by the media and 
the American public. With its remaining nuclear arsenal partially intact, Americans should be more concerned 

with and aware of what is happening in Russian politics 

By Bill Herkel,. ... 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

President Boris Yeltsin is argu-
ably the only chance fordemocracyto 
succeed in Russia. 

Both Andrew Reynolds and Ben 
Lavinequestioned whether the Vnited 
Stales' continued faith in and support 
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
was fully justified in these Oct. II 
articles. They also implied that Yeltsin 
himselfmight not hold the best chance 
for the future of Russian democracy. 

The media has misled many 
Americans into believing that states 
in the former Soviet Union have no 
chance of ever reuniting. But I am 
not convinced that the media real-
izes just how powerless or improp-
erly educated the average citizens 
of the former Soviet Union are. If a 
Russian businessman from the up-
per class tells Ted Koppel that his 
people will fight for democracy, it 
does not mean that these people will 
know how to fight or whom they 
will follow. The former Soviet V nion 
is in a state of political and eco-
nomic chaos. Without Yeltsin, a 
volatile situation is imminent. 

Now the cameras have left the 
Kremlin, and America has once 
again focused on the domestic fail-
ures of health care and education. 
Until the next crisis, we will not 
hear a word on how the world's 
largest nuclear arsenal is to be gov-

emed. Our lack of concem or wa-
vering over who to support is caused 
by a fallacious view painted by the 
media. This vision leads us to be-
lieve that although the road may be 
bumpy, Russia, with or without 
Yeltsin, is moving in a positive di-
rection - this in itself is a myth. 
L.ooIdnC to Moscow for 
LNdersIIlp 

Last week, a popular morning 
news program did a piece in which 
a Russian composer returned to his 
native land to perform triumphantly 
in Red Square. Dan Rather deliv-
ered his reports from outside the 
Kremlin, and more shots were shown 
of SI. Basil's Cathedral in the heart 
of Moscow than of any other single 
structure in Russia. But the region 
around Moscow is only one of 88 
separate Russian states, and Russia, 
the largest of approximately 10 
former republ ics, still c1ai ms an eco-
nomic alliance with members of the 
former Soviet Union. 

Moscow is only a fading point of 
interest for most of the former So-
viet Union. At last count, signifi-
cantly more than half of the Russian 
states have expressed dissatisfac-
tion with the muses in Moscow. In 
1991, the obiasl (counties) around 
Saint Petersburg flined with the idea 
of declaring its independence. 

Many republics of the former 
Soviet Union are not looking to 

Our lack of 
concern or 
wavering over 
who to support is 
due to a 
fallacious view 
painted by the 
media. This vision 
leads us to _ 
believe that 
although the road 
may be bumpy, 
Russia, with or 
without Veltsln, Is 
moving In a 
positive direction 
- this In Itself Is 
a myth. 

Moscow for leadershi p even as they 
are falling apart. Siberian unease 
over Moscow's instability is lead-
ing to a resurgence of horrific memo-
ries of Russian atrocities committed 
during the colonization of siberian 
territories centuries ago. Georgian 
officials li ve in fear of assassi na-
tion. Every day, tensions ri e be-
tween Armenian and Azeri Turks 
in the Transcaucus region. Mongo-
lian influence continues to spread 
with excitement in Central Asia, 
and Vladivostok (the starofthe east) 
has found a profitable new alliance 
in its increased contact with Japan. 
Apparently, these republics want to 
run their own li ves now. 
AY.,..e Citizens Don't Agree 
with Veltsln'. Reforms 

A verage citizens do not even 
understand Yeltsin's reforms. One 
suggested, "It is a system where 
Moscow no longer buys the food to 
keep it Cheap." People know what 
affects them in their immediate sur-
roundings. Russians see skyrocket-
ing prices, frightening increases in 
crime, and nothing from the govern-
ment but continued promises. They 
might not truly understand what 
Yeltsin is doing nor support it, but 
when he goes to the Slreet, they wi II 
flock to him. He is their leader and 
Russian mentality makes him a gi -
ant among men. 

When Western reporters com-

ment on his popularity, they mistak-
enly group his personality and popu-
larity with nationwide approval of 
hi s policies. In the forl11er So\iet 
Union, the tlVO are nllt inh.:relllly 
connected. 
Improving the Uvea of Citizens 

Two weeks ago, the WaJhillguJII 
Post Weekly ran an :micle which de-
emphasized the plight of ordinary 
ci tizens in Russia, exaggerating the 
fact that for the tir~t time in years, 
there is a plethora of food on Rus-
sian streets. This quantity does ex-
ist, but the price of it i~ beyond 
anything we can fathom. Price, for 
foodstuffs have risen in some cases 
more than 200'lr fu~ter than the rate 
ofintlation and the ave rage monthly 
wage. 

And with thb frightful ,eene 
comes the highe~t crime-rate e~ca­
lation in the history of either Mos-
cow or St. Petersburg. Violent 
crimes and acce" [0 weapons are 
increasing faster than the rate of 
intlation, and theft has become COI11-
monplace. Just tlVO yems ago, I 
walked the streets of Petersburg af-
ter midnight without fear of inci-
dent. My Russian friends tell me 
now that it i~ not unusua l to read 
about foreigners being robbed in the 
safety of their hotel rooms. 

Outside the ci ties, transportation 
lines are faltering without I'epair,

X CULTURE: 
Dispelling 
comparisons with 
the Boomers 
Continued from page 4 
about our lot. We glorify our sup-
posed alienation and lack of oppor-
tunity. The sad story sounds like 
this: we have no war [0 rally against 
or fight in; we have no enemies, 
only problems; our parents are all 
divorced; as our college degrees get 
more expensi ve, they lose their 
worth; we will probably be poorer 
than our parents. 

One theme that characterizes all 
this Xer angst is the comparison 
with the boomer generation. A c1as· 
sic bit of Generation X culture can 
be found in the opening of Ni rvana's 
song, "Nevermind." Bassist Chris 
Novose lic parod ies the 
Youngbloods' 1967 fee l-good song 
"Get Together" by sneering. hC' mon 
people now, smile on your brother, 
everybody get together, try to love 
one another right now," fo llowed by 
an ultra-fuzz punk ri ff. 
Boomer Envy? 

This intro tells much about the 
psychological state of many Xers. 
We are fascinated by - even envi-
ous - of the lore and images of the 
60s, even envious. But at the same 
time, we don't buy all that starry-
eyed utopia crap. The boomers tried 
it, and it didn 't work . We would 
love to have an evil to ra il y against, 
but unfortunately none of us has 
experienced. or even remembers, 
any sort of protracted war. Instead, 
we are left trying to decide which of 
the many confusing issues in our 
world is presently worth getting ar-
rested for. Call it boomer envy. 

Then we complain that we were 
neglected as kids - left in front of 
the cable TV while our parents made 
money and got di vorced. Mean· 
while. the former hippies look over 
the system and are now preventing 
us from succeeding in it. Call this 
boomer resentment. 

Finally, we resist l1eing labeled 
because we are so diverse. This is 
actually a step forward fo r our gen· 
eration because "diver ity" was not 
one of the battle cries of the '60s. I 
saw the Woodstock film . White. 
Middle class. About the only black 
person there was Jimi Hend rix . 

When baby boomers say things 
like "we tried to change the world, 
man," the "we" is not as all-encom· 
passing as they would like to be-
lieve. The fact is, many more people 
in America now claim to have been 
at Woodstock than we know actu-
ally attended the event. From all the 
'60s nostalgia, you would think that 
everybody fel t like they wel'e parr of 
one big movement. 

BUI not every American born 
after 1945 rall ied against the war, 
tried to change the system. or even 
felt much of a bond with other 
boomers. 

So we shouldn 't be led to fee l so 
alienated from each other. At best, 
we are less cliquish.All the attention 
is nice, though. Until now, the 
boomer-dominated media was too 
busy in its self-obsession with an-
cient issues such as menopause and 
aging to ever notice us. 

And I kind of like the term "Gen-
eration X." It' s catchy, but don' t 
take the term seriouslyorthinkthere 
is any meaning behind it. Our gen-
eration, whoever that includes. will 
have just as many successes and 
failures as any·other. My first pro-
posal is that we unite to SlOp com-
paring ourselves with the boomers 
and take our own ti me as it comes.

One of the media's most inane 
bad habits is to bark down 
Gorbachev's door for daily opin-
ions on issues. A few days ago, 
William Safire of the New York 
Times wondered aloud about some 
of Gorbachev's possible thoughts, 
and a few days before. NBC news 
struggled toextracr a comment from 
Gomachev as he left a carand headed 
toward his house. When will the 
West realize that Gorbachev is about 
as popular in the former Soviet 
Union as Nixon would be at a Demo-
cratic fundraiser1 

Personally, I feel Gorbachev is 
one of the most important and intel-
ligent leaders of the last half-cen-
tury, bui the fact remains that he is 
looked down upon in the streets of 
Moscow and is not a principle factor 
in the fate of Russia. 

The media has never properly 
emphasized just how poorly 
Gorbachev speaks the Russian lan-
guage. Gorbachev also ordered the 
Soviet tanks to run barriers in Latvia 
crushing pro-democracy demonstra-
tors just months before he was 
granted the Nobel Peace Prize. 

CIvIIW.~ ...... '

As long as Yeltsin is alive and 
does not become aggressive against 
his own people, movements toward 
Civil War will never gain strength. 
Simply put, Russian mentality is 
based highly on obedience to a pow-
erful leader. There exists no pos-
sible foe who could match Yeltsin 
in prestige or charisma. Yeltsin is 
the first democratically-elected state 
leader in the history of Russia, and 
whether or nol citizens agree with 
him, they will not take anns in great 
numbers against him. If Parliament 
members think they have any chance 
of defeating him, they are fooling 
themselves. 

However, the continued prolif-
eration of isolated violence and up-
heaval in the fonner Soviet Union 
will continue, and someday, with 
the absence of Yeltsin, it could very 
well consume the nation.

market just waiting to be consumed 
by capitalism. Although in the near 
future capitalism may be an option, 
right now big-city economies are 
firmly in the hands of the Mafia. 

The Russian Mafia, which began 
its march to power during the 
Gorbachevera, has increased its hold 
on the big cities with frightening 
skill- inflating prices, opening an 
extensive gambling ci rcuit and es-
tablishing a booming prostitution 
industry both on the streets and in 
cafes. As one walks down Nevsky 
Prospect, the main thoroughfare in 
St. Petersburg. one is amazed that 
every apple stand is elling its prod-
ucts at precisely the same cost. 
Cheese prices Airel y vary, and bread 
stores all over the city feature the 
same price. 

Citizens buy Ihe right to sell prod-
ucts on the streets from the Mafia 
with an understanding that they will 
not un~rcut other Mafia stands. 
Those who do not comply are sim-
ply shut down, often in violent fash-
ion. 

The Mafia buys nearly all do-
mestic train and airplane tickets 
months in advance and then forces 
the prices to ridiculously high lev-
els. The same holds true in lesser 
fashion with concert halls and popu-
lar movie houses. Mafia-owned slot 
machines and lottery draws litter 
the streets and ~afes. Some Rus-
sians go so far as to call Yeltsin a 
"Mafia stooge." 

It is not hard to see that the ma-
jority of Russian citizens who have 
benefited economically from 
Yeltsin' s reform have done so 
through the Mafia and other illegal 
activities. 
1'IIr..e ...... N.DI •• W. 
....... 

The only thing which holds the 
fonner Soviet Union from complete 
collapse is President Yeltsin, and 
with every demonstration. such as 
the latest Parliamentary holdout, 
comes the possibi lity of Yeltsin los-
ing some of his power. Thousands 
of nuclear warheads lie at bay in one 
of the most unstable polilical realms 
in the world. 

Truly pessimistic indi viduals like 
myself feel that North Korea has 
already become the first beneficiary 
of leftover nuclear technologies. 
Several months ago, the Russian 
military held a trade show in West-
ern Europe selling aircraft and In-
tercontinental Ballistic Missiles. 
Those products may find their way 
into the equation of an a lready eerie 
Middle East peace agreement. If 
Yeltsin dies, either by assassination 
or. of natural causes. there will be no 
one strong enough to replace him.

co-oP: Che 
Cafe, fonner member 
trade allegations 
ContInued from PIlle 1 
Stephens founded to feed the 
homeless. 

"They have the impression that 
[ was an authoritarian figure ... I 
am a bit relentless and driven. I 
want to make sure the homeless 
people are fed, and I would have 
thought that it would have been 
well within the purview and the 
mission of the CM Cafe to feed 
homeless people," Stephens said. 

Stephens repeated the charges 
he first made public in a Sept. 7 
leiter to University Events Direc-
tor L~nn Peterson. In that letter, 
Stephens charged the Che collec-
tive with fabrication of its quar-
terly report, fraudulent inventory 
assessment, misrepresentation to 
Farmer's Insurance, violations of 
the health code, letting members 
sleep at the cafe and allowing non-
students to run the restaurant. 

"It's difficult to catalogue all 
the incompetence [at the Che 
Cafe]," Stephens said. 

Members of the Che Cafe de-
clined to respond to Stephens' spe-
cific allegations. "If he brought 
evidence, then we would be per-
fectly willing to defend ourselves," 
said collective member Tom Hayes. 

"A crank on Ceraldo presents 
better evidence that Martin Luther 
King killed JFK than he's pre-
sented," Hayes added. 

According to Stephens, in its 
quarterly report to the administra-
tion, the C~ Cafe did not have X 
and Z receipts from the register. 
Stephens claimed that cafe mem-
bers fabricated the receipts and 
turned them in to the administra-

FORUM: 
Regents object to 
UCSA proposal 
Continued from PIlle 3 
ing program advocated by the 
University of California Student 
Association (UCSA). Under this 
plan, funds gathered from student 
activity fees would be held in an 
escrow account for four to five 
weeks. 

During that time, students 
would be able to recover their fees 
before the money is allocated. The 
A.S. supports this method because 
it has traditionally yielded more 
money in return than the positive 
check-off. 

Administrators, however, are 

tion. 
According to Peterson, the 

MOU requires mandatory audits 
of the quarterly reports. TheChe's 
spring report is currently being 
reviewed by an accountant. 

Stephens also alleged that the 
Ch6 Caf6 guessed the quanti ty and 
value of its inventory. A walk-in 
refrigerator space that cost $30,000 
was valued at $6,000 by collective 
members, Stephens said. "So any 
hit on the refrigerator and we'd 
lose $24,000 right off the bat and 
never be able to afford to put an-
other one in there," Stephens 
added. 

A Sept. 2 concert was held at the 
C~ without proper insurance, ac-
cording to Stephens. Peterson veri-
fied that the restaurant's program-
ming insurance was null and void: 
However, according to collective 
members. the concert was held with 
the understanding that the Chefs 
insurance was sufficient. When they 
discovered that this was not the 
case,Che members canceled a Sept. 
3 concert, Cronyn said. 

In a Sept. 14 letter to the Che, 
Co-op Oversight Committee Chair 
Wally Lockwood acknowledged 
the misunderstanding and said that 
the committee would waive its 
right to declare the concert a vio-
lation of the MOU. 

Stephens also alleged that the 
Che Cafe is in frequent violation of 
local health codes, citing a rating of 
an 82.5 out of 100 on a restaurant 
evaluation over the summer. 

According to Peterson, the C~ 
has since improved its rating to a 
90.6 during the latest Environmen-
tal Helllth Inspection. 

Stephens has accused non-stu-
dents of taking over the Ch6 Cafe's 
space. "At the CM Caft you have 
a number of non-students not pay-

skeptical of the escrow proposal 
because it is similar to a negative 
check-off policy, which violates 
regental policy. In negative check-
off, studel)ts are asked to mark a 
box if they do not want their fees 
to be spent on student organiza-
tions. 

The regents disagree with this 
because it could mean that student 
fees will be used without consent, 
leading to "compelled association" 
with the organizations to which 
the student objects. 

According to Tesak, escrow 
circumvents this because student 
fees aren't being spent until all 
students have had ample time to 
respond. 

With only nine days left before 
the Chancellors' Meeting, when

ing any sort of tuition ... taking

cafe. sleeping at the cafe, 
pri vatizing the cafe, using it as 
their place," he said. A video tape 
shot by Stephens documents sev-
eral shanties on CM property 
which members used to sleep in. 

Both Peterson and collective 
members acknowledge that stu-
dents have slept at the cafe. Ac-
cording to Peterson, the collective 
has been warned that this is a vio· 
lation of university policy. 

Responding to the charge of 
non-students running the cafe. 
Peterson said that the four princi-
pal members of the organization 
are undergraduates. There is no 
university policy prohibiting non-
students from being involved with 
astudent organization like the Che. 

Collective member Colin Wil-
son said that Stephens' allegations 
are without merit. "If you're look-
ing for violations of the MOU, 
we've been keeping our nose so 
clean, it's ridiculous," he said. 

Funhennore, collective mem-
bers have charged that Stephens' 
allegations are motivated by a hid-
den agenda to take over the Che's 
assets. According to one member, 
Stephens had expressed his desire 
to put up a bid in for the restaurant 
as early as May. 

Stephens responded that he is 
acting within the best interests of 
students and the university. "[The 
Che Cafe is] a private feeding 
trough where non-students, who 
have no interest in UCSD, are a 
liability to the university... and 
are a detriment to other students 
on campus," Stephens said. 

--n.e university seems to rather 
not police anything down there and 
pretend it's not happening, but it's 
just not JOing to work," he said. 

adminisU'8tors will decide which 
proposal to follow, A.S. leaders 
have mounted a campaign to per-
suade administrators to adopt an 
escrow policy instead of a positi ve 
check-off. 

At the forum, they urged stu-
dent organizations to write letters 
to Chancellor Richard Atkinson in 
support of this option. 

Members of the A.S. External 
Affairs Office wrote a letter to 
Atkinson expressing these beliefs. 

"[A refund-escrow fee] ... will 
allow student majorities to fund 
organizations and activities that 
promote intellectual growth and 
political development while giv-
ing the minority the rights they 
deserve under the Smith ruling," 
the letter read.

Year 
'!i ." , 

Life 
JACK: His frrst year in office was 
marked by administrative reorganization 
Continued from p.,e 1 
paid just four years earlier. Fac-
ulty and staff positions were being 
trimmed, and the university's repu-
tation was taking a beating. All in 
all , it was not the best of times for 
the UC system. It was a lousy ti me 
to be inaugurated as UC president. 

"Certainly, it was an over-
whelming job to step into," said 
University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) Executive 
Director Andy Shaw. 

Peltason himself characterized 
his first year as one of "major 
challenges," a view shared by 
many within the university. But 
the first anniversary of the Peltason 
administration was observed on 
Oct. 15, and it is still unclear 
whether anything has changed 
since that afternoon at Royce Hall . 
A Ve. of ...... Choices 

In a speech to the regents on 
Sept. 24, Peltason addressed his 
first year in office and the current 
state of the university. "As you are 
all painfully aware, this university 
is experiencing the most difficult 
economic retrenchment in its his-
tory. It would be foolish to say that 
the consequences haven't been 
wrenching foreverybody ," he said. 

But in spite of the fee hikes for 
students and pay cuts for staff and 

faculty, PeItason said that the hard 
choices involved preserving the 
UC's quality. "We have tried to 
protect high-quality instruction, 
we have continued our commit-
ment to diversity, we have main-
tained a distinguished faculty and 
a talented and dedicated staff and 
we are streamlini ng our operations 
on every campus and in the Office 
of the President," he said. 

For the university, the first year 
of the PeItason administration was 
marked by a reorganization of the 
Office of the Pres ident. At 
September's meeting of the Board 
of Regents, a transition team 
headed by UCLA Chancellor 
Charles Young issued its report on 
how the UC system could main-
tain its status as a top university in 
light of the ongoing decline in 
state funding. Many of the transi-
tion team's 85 recommendations 
are still in the process of review. 

Peltason's reorgan i zation 
scheme calls for a more stream-
lined university. Last week, dur-
ing a call-in program broadcast on 
the California Channel, Peltason 
told a caller that the university's 
administrative budget had taken 
major cuts. With all the restructur-
ing at the Office of the President, 
Shaw said, "It will take a year and

, 

a half to see what that results in . 
"It remains to be seen whether 

these will be good changes," Shaw 
added. 
A Malter 01 Communication 

In some ways, the changes 
within the UC administrative 
structure have led to problems in 
communication. "To be quite 
frank, it's hard to tell who's in 
charge," said Shaw, who added 
that Peltason has delegated more 
duties to his vice presidents and 
chancellors than his predecessor, 
David Gardner. 

"Gardner had answers for ev-
erythjng. Peltason leans more on 
his suppon staff," Shaw said. 

Indeed, a common criticism 
ofPeltason has been his tendency 

to avoid giving concrete answers 
in his dealings with students -
an ironic critique in light of the 
fact that Peltason was often 
praised for his open comm unica-
tion with students and faculty 
during his tenure as chancellor at 
UC Irvine. 

In an interview with the Guard-
ian editorial board during his visit 
to UCSD in February, Peltason 
frequently declined to answer 
questions concerning campus is-
sues, citing chancellor autonomy. 
At a meeting with student leaders 
on that same visit, Peitason seemed 
unfamiliar with specific issues 
facing UCSD students. according 
to then-Graduate Student Asso-
ciation President Patrick Carroll. 

In a Guardiall commentary, 
Carroll wrote, "Retlecting on this 
later, J thought it very un atisfac-
tory; I consider it an abrogation of 
responsibility ," 
A Problem With Penalona 

When Peitason rook office last 
October, the university was sti ll 
smarting ti'0I0 a public relations 
drubbing over Gardner' s $2.4 mil-
lion retirement pm;kage . A report 
from the State Auditor General in 
September, I992,criticizedtheUC 
system for granting frivolous perks 
and fringe benefits to its execu-
tives. 

When he became president, 
Peltason vowed to get the

JACK: Looking 
ahead to the DC 
system's future 
ContInued from .,... 10 
eq)barrassing development last 
May, however, the university be-
came plagued with more pension 
problems when outgoing Vice 
President Ronald Brady was 
granted a full year's salary of 
$181,640 after his retirement. Like 
Gardner's much-criticized pen-
sion, the package was arranged 
and approved behind closed doors. 

"As you know all too well ... 
we have been criticized for some 
of our policies and practices re-
garding executive compensation," 
Peltason told the regents last 
month. 

"As you also know, we have 
instituted some significant re-
forms, among them the elimina-
tion of the deferred compensation 
program and a number of benefits, 
as well as the adoption of a salary-
setting scale for executive com-
pensation .. :' 
WINd tile Future ....... 

The problems that Peltason has 
faced in the past year may seem 
tame when compared with the chaJ-
lenges of the future, and that could 
be the biggest hurdle for the presi-
dent to overcome. "H is leadershi p 
has not been strong enough to guide 
the university in a long-term sense 
through the budget crisis," Shaw 
said.

sity must reconsider the way it

uc President Jack Peltason 
characterized his first year as 
one of ~reorganjzation and

prepare the university for 
tougher financial times. Those 
four Initiatives are:

• PrMervInc Aud .... c QualltJ: Peltason plans to meet 
with administrators, faculty, 
students and staff to discuss the 
goals of the university. The 
president hopes to develop a 
course of action for the university 
to follow Into the next century.

becoming more scarce, Peltason

the university out of Its budgetary

creases. "The question is how can 
the university restructure itself to 
deliver a quality education to all 
the students knocking on its door," 
said Shaw, adding that the $600 
fee increase proposed last week 
would be an inadequate way in 
which to deal with the challenges 
of the future . 

"[The university] can' t rely on 
rai~ing fees as it has in the past," 
he said. 

Peltason, however, said that the 
future is brightening for the Uni-
versity of California. He cited the 
$50 million restored to the UC 
budget in July by Gov. Pete Wil-
son as a sign that the state govern-
ment is beginning to acknowledge 
the importance of the university. 
"I think things are getting better 
because they are not getting worse. 
I wish I could guarantee that we 
have come through the worst of 
our troubles, but I can't," Peltason 
said. 

"Still, I remain optimistic, and 
my optimism is grounded in the 
firm conviction that California 
can't prosper unless education 
does," he added. 

Peltason acknowledged that his 
first year as president was a chal-
lenging one. In spite of the hard-
ships, however, Peltason said that 
the year also demonstrated the "re-
silience of this splendid institu-
tion." He referred back to his inau-
guration day speech when he spoke 
of the peril facing the university. 
''The peril remains; it would be 
foolish to pretend otherwise. But 
during the past year we havelaken 
some direct and positive steps to 
stabilize UC and to prepare for the 
long haul," Peltason said.

mained unde-
feated with 
the will, run-
ning their 
record to 
IO-{)-I by es-
caping the 
Cougars, 

who were playingtheirfU'St~vernight 
home game. 

UCSD, which has had trouble with 
finishing off scoring opportunities all 
season, was troubled again by a lack 
of scoring punch. 

"The score probably should have 
been 5-1 or 6-1," UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus said. "They were 
very excited to be playing at night, so 
we played very well just by creating 
the chances." 

Creating chances was nO problem 
for the Tritons, who blitzed Azusa 
Pacific goalkeeper April Reed with 
22 shots. 

But Reed was up to the challenge 
and almost single-handedly kept her 
team in the game. Reed's opposite 
number, TritonkeeperCari Schwartz, 

was the beneficiary of 4ler team's 
superior defense and had to make 
only two saves on the day. 

UCSD finally broke through Reed 
and the Cougar defense with 14 min-
utes to play in the fIrSt half when 
Amanda Johnson took it to the goal 
and passed off to teammate Ele 
Johnson. EIeJohnson stepped around 
a defender, and Reed tapped the ball 
in for the only goal San Diego would 
need. 

According to McManus, Ele 
Johnson and fellow-forward Carin 
Pugh both excelled for the Tritons, as 
did Tritons Daphne Famwn and Jen-
nifer Ewert who have "started play-
ing to their potential the last three or 
four weeks," the coach said. 

The win was especially big be-
cause Azusa Pacific had already de-
feated UCSD's chief rival, Cal 
Lutheran. The Tritons don't play the 
Regals this year, but Cal Lutheran has 
defeated Claremont, which UCSD 
tied. 

McManusdoesn'tlackconfidence 

in his team, but even he is surprised by 
the Tritons' undefeated record. 
"We've been playing a lot of un-
known teams and at the beginning of 
the season I was hoping we'd be 8-3 
right now," he said. 

Considering the schedule UCSD 

UCSD 1 

AZUSA PACIFIC 0 

has played, the record is even more 
surprising. 

After tying Claremont 0-0 in the 
second game of the season, the low 
point of the year so far, the Tritons 
rattled off three wins in a row against 
Division I teams. 

McManus doesn't want his team 
look.ing too far ahead, but he did com-
pare this year's squad to last year's 
NCAA Final Four contingent. The 
biggest loss was the graduation of 

forward Katy Dulock, one of the best 
players ever to lace up cleats for 
UCSD. 

However, McManus said, others 
have stepped up to fill those shoes. 
"Ele Johnson has played very well 
and [pugh] has picked up her game 
1,000 percent from last year." 

One of the coach'schier concerns 
was made ev ident in the Azusa game. 

"Azusa was a physical team, and 
they shoved us around. We' re not a 
physical learn, we're a little too nice, 
we need to give a little bit back. But 
we make up for it with skill and a 101 
of hard work," McManus aid. 

McManus also credits his eniors, 
including Katie Larkin , Eva 
Kingsbury and Michelle Carbone for 
a ponion of the team's success. 

'They've got a great attitude, and 
when they're not playing they ' re up 
on the sideline getting the younger 
players going." 

The Tritons take on Pomona-Pitzer 
today in Pomona, another huge game 
for the San Diego squad.

Continued from page20

the Mavericks on a bet. Now. my 
nights are plagued by Mike luzzolino 
- no doubt a reject from the CBA 
Albany Patroons - who becomes a

floors Patrick Ewing with nn elbow.

"You should just dunk the ball 
every time," !klYS a friend of mine, 
who is knowledgeable about the;;: 
things. But every time I try. the 
demonic luzzolino is waiti ng for me 
with evil intent in his hear1. 

Hmmm. Maybe Michael Jordan

18-4 school session. 
A beleaguered Panther front was 

thwarted at every tum by the Tritons' 
excellent defense and equally impres-
sive counterattack. 

Dan Aufhauser's half-tank upper 
right-hand comer rifle which ended 
the second quarter of play at 9-0. 
summed up just how poor.ly Chapman 
matched up against the second string. 

The junior varsity faced 
Grossmont Junior College in its first 
game of the round-robin tournament 
against the top three junior varsi ty 
teams in the state. 

"We played real well ." Sanders 
said of the 9-8 loss to Grossmont. 
"We had a chance to tie it at the end to 
put the game into overtime. but we 
couldn 't [convert the final shotl." 

ter to pull out an 18-13 victory. 
Golden West. the state 's top-

ranked le., finished off the Tritons 
early in the last game of the round 
robin. winning 11-4. 

"Overall. we played tough. These 
games give us a lot of experience so 
when [the guys] go into varsity games 
they can match up." Sanders said. 

"A few of the younger guys help 
the varsity team off the bench [now]," 
Harper said. 

The varsity did jump in the pool 
against another Harper-coached polo 
unit. the Sunset Water Polo Club team. 

Mike Nalu, UCSD's leading 
scorer. was shut down in the first half, 
but like all those who have faced the 
Tritons know, stopping Nalu is like 
tryi/lg to stop a bullet with tofu - it 
just doesn't happen. 

Nalu rifled four goals, including a 
rocket two-pointer, in the Tritons 14-
II victory over Sunset. 

In their econd game. the Tritons 
held tough against the state' s second-
ranked J.e. team, Long Beach City 
College. UCSD entered the fourth 
quarter only two shots back, 13-11 . 
but the more experienced Long Beach 
squad asserted itself in the final quar-

Sean Kingham netted two cross-
cage goals from the left side on man-
up situations. Goalie Andy Bruce was the only starter to play In Chapman slaying.

PHILIP 

MIIJUlELS 
The Curse Of 
Mike Iuzzolino 

Maybe it's because the 
lunkheads at Channel 8 decided 
not to broadcast the 4ger-
Cowboy game yesterday, but I'm 
a man with hoops on my mind. 
Michael Jordan has something to 
do with this, I'm sure - medical 
science has pretty much deter-
mined Jordan has something to 
do with everything. 

Look at Nike stock - Jordan 
definitely has a profound 
influence on that. The biggest 
question after Jordan 's retire-
ment could be what happens to 
the good people at Nike, 
McDonald's and Gatorade. Who 
will hawk their numerous wares 
now that Mike's off at the 
driving range practicing his 
approach shot? Personally, 1 
can't see the Clippers' Stanley 
Roberts as the next spokesman 
for Hanes underwear. 

Oh, I guess the Chicago Bulls 
are somewhat concerned about 
this ret irement thing as well. 
After all, it 's never easy to go 
from "The three-time defending 
World Champions" to "Scottie 
Pippen and Four Guys named 
Horace." Who's going to step in 
to fill Jordan 's Nikes -
European superstar Toni Kukoc1 
Not very likely, though his 
addition does give the Bulls a 
great new slogan ("We're 
cuckoo for Kukoc!"). 

But even Jordan's gold watch 
party doesn't explain why I've 
become hoop-obsessed. No, the 
fault lies squarely on the 
shoulders of that accursed video 
game "NBA Jam." This is a 
horrible arcade abomination, a 
travesty of a sham that's tearing 
this nation apart. 1 consider NBA 
Jam to be a wretched tangle of 
circuits and megabytes for one 
simple reason - I can't win the 
damn game to save my life. 

On Saturday, I spent a couple 
of hours playing "NBA Jam" 
(for research purposes only, I 
can assure you). The highlight of 
the aftemoon had to be when I 
raced to a 20-8 lead only to 
come from ahead to lose 60-58. I 
am so thoroughly wretched that I 
cannot even beat the lowly 
Dallas Mavericks. 

Now, the Mavericks are no 
doubt wonderful human beings, 
but let's face facts - a team made 
up of trained spider monkeys 
could beat them. Anyone can 
beat the Mavericks. Except for 
me, that is.

UCSD Forced To 
Grin and Bear It 
WOMEN'S VOUEYBALL: Top-ranked Washington 
University holds off 11 match points, foiling Triton 
upset hopes; UCSD fInishes Mizuno Invitational 3-1 
By Aron MIUer 
Associate Sports Editor 

In what was billed as the all-time 
mother of regular season NCAA Di-
vision III women 's volleyball 

matches, top-
ranked Univer-
sityofWashing-
ton and third-
ranked UCSD 
speared and 
c lawed each 
other for five 
heart-pounding 
sets Friday night 
in the Mizuno 
Invitational 
Tournament. 

In the end 
the visitors from St. Louis proved 
that they are certainly worthy of the 
nation's top seed, battling back from 
a two-games-to-none deficit. The 
Bears valiantly fought off 11 Triton 
match-points in game four en route 
to an 8-15,12-15,15-10,17-15, 17-
15 victory in front of a packed house 
at UCSD's Main Gym. 

With steady serving, strong dig-
ging and constant crowd support, 
UCSD took a 13-6 advantage in the 
first game of the match. 

With the crowd on its feet at 14-8, 
senior Laura Kranz slammed a spike 
down the Bears' throats to give San 
Diego the 1-0 lead. 

After the Bears went up 6-2 in 
game two, sophomore Joyce Lee 
served the Tritons to a 6-6 tie. 

The two teams traded point for 
point until UCSD finally broke 
through, taking a 14-11 lead. Again, 
the Tritons looked to Kranz to wrap 
up the set, and she throttled a vicious 
kill past a seemingly impenetrable 
wall of Washington middle blockers, 
giving San Diego a commanding 2-
o lead in games. 

The Tritons came out passive in 
game three and the Bears took full 
advantage, going up 11 -7 and taking 
the set easily, 15-\0. 

UCSD walked onto the court with 
renewed vigor in game four, which 
turned out to be one of the most 
exciting games of volleyball in Tri-
ton history. UCSD went up quickly, 
11-4, and then took an almost insur-
mountable lead of 14-9. 

At match point, the roaring crowd 
stood and deafened the gym, but the 
Bears held. The Tritons served for 
the match 11 times, but Washington 
miraculously staved off the point 
and forced the crowd"back to its 
seats. 

Slowly, Washington cut into 
UCSD's lead and finally drew even 
at 14. Down 15-14, the Bears once 
again quieted the restless crowd, fore-
ing a sideout and winning three 
straight points to take the set 17-15, 
requiring a fifth and deciding game. 

In the fifth game, the Tritons took 
leads of 6-4 and 8-5, only to see the 
Bears (26-1 ) come back to tie it at 10. 
Then it was tied at II. Then at 12. 
And eventually at 15. 

Julie Harvey (4) and Jennifer Cross couldn't stop the Bears' comeback.
