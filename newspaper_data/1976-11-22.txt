St~ Regent Peeples Tackles Bureaucracy 
Ity IA .. Rlebter 

Staff Writer 

"I want students not just to go to 
school, but to be involved with the 
educational process," says Daryn 
Peeples, 1978-77 Student Regent. 
Peeples was at UCSD Friday for 
the Student Body Presidents' 
Council (SBPC). She said her 
present position is a result of her 
I)wn active involvement at the UC 
;erkeley campus. 
Peeples served as chairperson of 

the Student Advisory Committee to 
the Office of Admissions and 
Records and as member of the 
Registration Fee Committee. It 
was through her job with the 
Public Information Office that she 
first began attending SBPC 
meetings. This sparked her in-
terest in inter-campus student 
government. 

Peepletl Trades Study Time 
Peeples sacrifices her study time 

in order to prepare herself for 
Regents meetings and to gather 

student input Although few people 
actually visit during her five office 
hours each day, she has many 
telephone calls and letters to which 
she must respond. Her constant 
concern is that students are aware 
of her presence and know that she 
can be contacted. 

There are certain issues up 
before the Board which Peeples 
said she feels deserve the special 
attention of the students. 
Presently, the Registration Fee 
increase is of major concern. 
Establishing official student 
autonomy from the University, 
Board Item 513, is important in 
that the Regents still have a 
controlling interest in each 
campus' student government 
through the chancellors. This 
control is somewhat less at the 
Berkeley campus, she said, but 
autonomy has still not been 
assured. 

The issues before theRegents this 
week include a study of the 

UCSD Biohazards Committee 
Oversees Research Risks 

by Joel C. Don 
Associate News Editor 

The strict surveillance of scientific hazards, such as the recent 
radioactive co n tamination at the VA Hospital in La Jolla, is one of the 
concerns of the UCSD Biohazards Committee, said Lee Henderson, 
chairman of the Committee. Henderson, as chairman of the Committee, 
directs a 13-member group of overseers of all on-going research and 
potentially biohazardous experiments. 

According to Henderson, the initial role of the Committee was to 
"catalog" the research through a questionnaire sent to all researchers. 
The questionnaire strictly defined biohazardous research and the 
Committee will make sure that research involving recombinant DNA 
technology falls within the prescribed guidelines of the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH). 

Although UCSD has had an in-
formal biohazards committee 
since 1972, recent publicity over 
the controversial proposals for 
genetic engineering uperiroents 
prompted Chanoel1or . McElroy to 
make the appointment of an of-
ficial biohazards committee. 
Henderson noted that the 
Biohazards Committee met in 
advance of the NIH requirement. 

The Committee, composed of 11 
members from the academic 
community, a lay community 
lawyer and a representative from 

Lee Henderson Mayor Pete WilSon's office, is 
divided into a series of panels dealing with specific biohazard research 
issues. Henderson commented that a majority of the Committee, in-
cluding himself, are not involved in recombinant DNA research. Some of 
the specialized subcommittees include: 

-a panel which will address the education of the community as well as 
the principle investigators who are doing the research. 

-a panel handling non-recombinant DNA hazards. 
-a panel which will address the health of the community. 
-a panel of surveillance, for certification of the investigators. 
Although the Committee was fonned to monitor the UCSD researchers, 

Henderson admitted that "much of the surveillance carried out has to 
have faith in the principle investigator." He added that " the principle 
investigator will do the majority of surveillance of his staff and graduate 
students." 

Henderson believes that education will make graduate students and 
technical staff aware of any dangers. He also insisted that the Committee 
stands receptive to any problems the workers under the principle in-
vestigators may bring up. 

"There is Ii mechanism," Henderson said, "which allows the Com-
mittee to hear any breech of the NIH guidelines, aside from the principle 
investigator. " 

In regard to safety, many scientists involved in recombinant DNA 
research claim that it is almost in!possible to get these hybrid organisms 
to grow. Ajso,no one at UCSD will be involved in the production of known 
pathogens. Why then does the Committee address the issue of recom-
binant DNA research and why does it need blohazardous containment? 

Henderson explained that "it may not be clear what organisms would 
result," but he suggested that "there are reasonable expectations." 

"If people were aware of how difficult it i.s to make a genetic transfer, " 
Henderson argued, "they would be less critical." 

RadIoactive C ......... u.. 
Recently, inspectors at the VA Hospital fOmld excessive amomlts of 

radioactive Iodine 131(1131) in four or five research labs, and 1131 was 
escaping into the atmosphere via the emuent from the experimentation 
hoods. 

Some individua1a working in the contaminated areas were concerned 
over the unuaually high 1131 uptake in their thyroid glands, accordilll to 
sources cloee to the Triton Times. Although the 1131 overdose didn't cause 
any immediate effects, there is concern among these individuals that 
they are now more likely prone to cancer of the thyroid. 

Henderson, whole office is on the sixth noor of the VA Hospital, Is 
fa miliar with the VA's radioactive contamination, and s~gested the 
problem lies in the lack of enough physical monitoring. 

The seriousneu of the VA's detection problem directly relates to the 
mmittee and their monitoring of the emuent from UCSD's biohazard 

CeatlDHd _ Pate a 

statewide policy on deferred ad-
missions and the long range 
building plans for dormitories at 
UCLA. Peeples feels these ar 
"emotional issues," as is the Reg. 
Fee issue. 

Peeples expressed an "acute 
awareness" of the bureaucracy 
affecting students within the UC 
system. "It is absorbed into every 
facet of our education," she says. 
"It's gotten to the point where you 
can't see the light - where's the 
end?" Her cynicism has developed 
largely by working through red 
tape at herÂ· Berkeley office. 

"I've benefited tremendously," 
claims Peeples, from her Regent 
post. Yet the actual process of 

applying for the position proved to 
be " traumatic" for her. The 
waiting period lasted from 
January until May, and entailed 
several interviews and 
eliminations. She said she was 
thrilled by finally being chosen, 
and emphasizes that "it was all 
worth it." 

Regent Peeples may be reached 
at 773 University Hall at UC 
Berkeley. Her office will be 
relocated beginning winter quarter 
to 330 Sproul Hall. Her permanent 
phone number is 415-642~254 . 
Peeples is willing to help if 
students will make the effort to 
contact her.

Regents to Appeal Bakke Case 
The Board of Regents Friday 

reaffirmed its decision to appeal to 
the US Supreme Court a case that 
will decide the fate of UC's special 
minority admissions programs. 

The decision - announced after a 
closed session during the regents' 
meeting at UCLA - came despite 
protests from major civil rights 
organizations that pursuit of the 
appeal could mean a Supreme 
Court ruling to eliminate special 
minority admissions programs 
throupgut!be nation. 

The Regents' decision concerns 

an appeal of the California 
Supreme Court ruling that the 

special minority admissions 
program at the UC Davis Medical 
School violates the equal protection 
clause of the 14th Amendment. 

The state court made the ruling 
Sept. 16 in a case brought by Allan 
Bakke, a white applicant to the 
Davis Med School who claimed he 
was denied admission while less 
qualified minority applicants were 
accepted through tbe . speci~ 
program.

Merry Christmas Personals 
Only 34 more shopping days until Christmas. And only 15 days until 

the Triton Times finals week issue. 
On Dec. 6 the Triton Times will publish a special issue, to serve as a 

diversion from the paranoia and pressure of finals week. Highlighting 
the issue will be a section of Merry Christmas personals. 

In keeping with the season's spirit, the Merry Christmas personals 
will be only $.10, for every 100 spaces. Bring them by the Triton Time 
office, in the southeast comer of the Student Center. 

Merry Christmas. 

Minority Applicants Preference 
Such programs to give special 

preference to minority applicants 
were established by UC in the late 
sixties in an effort to increase the 
number of minorities in the legal 
and medical professions. 

Last Monday, the US Supreme 
Court blocked implementation of 
the Bakke ruling for 30 days to 
allow the Regents time to decide 
whether to appeal. 

Among the organiza.tions urging 
the Regents to arop the appeal 
were the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored 
People, the NAACP Legal Defense 
Fund, the National Conference of 
Black Lawyers, the Mexican-
American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund and the Southern 
California chapter of the American 
Civil Liberties Union. 

Representatives from several of 
those organizations told the 
Regents Thursday , during a 
committee meeting on the case, 
that UC General Counsel Donald 
Reidhaar has badly mishandled 
the case. 

The groups have said the UC 
case is weak because the 
University has not presented 
evidence of past racial 
discrimination which has deprived 
minorities of equal - ilducational 
opportunities. 

Such evidence is necessary to 
prove the need for programs in-
tended to compensate for past 

discrimina~ry practices, they say. 

Reidhaar RepUes 

In reply to such charges 
Reidhaar has said the civil rights 
organizations want UC "to admit 
or confess that the university has 
discriminated against minorities 
prior to establishing special ad-
missions programs ... The problem 
with that is that It simply is not 
true. " 

While the state Supreme Court 
ruled that a 1 applicant's economic 
and educational background can 
be considered in admissions 
programs that are " racially 
ne~.Â·Â· .,!Of" â¢ IS fmrttrtlott 
that modification of existing 
programs will sharply reduce the 
number of minority admissions. 

After the closed session Friday, 
Board chainnan William Coblentz 
said the Regents' vote to appeal 
wa not unanimou .

Letters to the Editor 

COOp Questions Budget Freeze 
Dear Mr. Murphy : 

The Student Cooperative Union 
wishes to respond to your letter of 
November 2, 1976 concerning your 
freeze of part of the Coop's budget 
package for funding student 
organizations, the Campus 
Program Board, Communications 
Board, and the Coop Umbrella 
expenses. We are agreeable to the 
recommendations of your 
Advisory Committee on Student 
Fee Programs that you lift the 
freeze, and we have no problem 
endorsing " .. . in principle, subject 
to refinement and amendation ... " 
the draft guidelines for our han-
dling of the $6 per quarter Student 
Activity ' Fee because the new 
guidelines are very nearly iden-
tical, in substance, to our old ones. 

For two years you have been ap-
proving our allocations on the basis 
of these guidelines, which you 
yourself have helped to "refine and 
amend" from time to time. How 
could anyone believe there was a 
real need for a freeze? 

Your "conference committee" 
recommended that, if approved, 
the new guidelines should ..... be 
effective from the date of final 
approval forward and not be ap-
plied retroactively." They also 
recommednded that " ... if these 
guidelines are acceptable to the 

Advisory Committee on Student 
Fee Programs and the Coop, the 
budgetary freeze be lifted ." 
(Emphasis added by Coop). We 
want to know how you reconcile 
this apparent contradiction. H the 
new guidelines were not being 
"applied retroactively," why were 
budgets frozen pending their 
adoption? 

Finally, we believe the budget 
controversy to be only slightly 
resolved by the lifting of the freeze

Students Show Disinterest 
In Quality of Education 
Those interested in the quality of education at UCSD and curious about 

the " standards" of the literature department will be interested to read 
the CAPE comments on Mrs. Eleanor Widmer'S Gen/LiVlZ1 of last 
winter. 

We find students expressing the following opinions about the course : "a 
must before graduation," "highly recommended," "one of the best," a 
course that "opened their eyes"-and about the instructor: "interesting," 
"dynamic," " an excellent lecturer," " with a unique lecture style," 
" unmatched enthusiasm and humanity," "one of UCSD's greatest 
assets." 

However, the fact of their 
striking similarity, and the fact 
you have persisted since your 
letters of June 23, 1976 in tying the 
release of the funds to the 
"development of guidelines" 
continues to disturb us. It has been, 
and remains our position that the 
freeze was a completely un-
necessary act on your part. 
Neither you nor your Advisory 
Committee cited specific ob-
jections or additions to our old 
guidelines or Constitutional 
provisions in taking 'the freeze 
action_ You had all summer to do 
so, but instead waited unW the 
middle of the fall tenn to convene a 
"conference committee." 

In the numerical ratings, 93% of the students place her in the two 
highest categories for general teaching effectiveness, 90% for stimulation 
of intellectual curiosity, 93% for the excellence of the course as a learning 
experience, 91% for lecture clarity, 96% for lecture structure. Mrs. 
Widmer has consistenUy received praises and ratings of this sort 
throughout her many years of teaching at UCSD. . 

This is the teacher whom the faculty of the literature department fired 
last year (or, to be precise, refused to reappoint as a lecturer), showing 
in the most blatant way its contempt for student opinion and its in-
difference to good teaching. 

Throughout this process neither 
you, nor your advisors, nor the 
Triton Times have acknowledged 
the essential soundness, or even 
the existence of our old guidelines. 

The episode has illustrated not only the cynicism and twisted 
judgement of the literature department but also the pusillanimity and 
passivity of UCSD students, who have made scarcely any effort to protest 
this willful affront to themselves and to the quality of their education.

Dr. Sigfreud lifted his hands to his eyes and tried to ward off the strobe 

light. "I tell you, some of my best frien<bJ friends are freshmen," he 
screamed-

"That's not good enough, Sigfreud," said a cloaked member of the 
inquisitional Academic Senate. "We want to know what you learned," 

Sigfreud sighed. The torture had been going on for a full twenty 
seconds. "All right, I'll teU you. 

"We ~ave all often laughed at freshmen, but we can do so no more," 
stated Slgfreud, 

There was silence in the hall. 
"The freshman is to be pitied, much like Revelle students or alcoholics. 

They are not in control of their actions." 
Sigfreud looked at the many figures around him, allowing a pregnant 

pause to develop as the breeding ground for a poignant delivery. " Fellow 
academia," he said, "being a freshman is a disease." 

Sigfreud raised his hands to quiet the sudden din. " My noted colleague, 
Dr. Schlock,. was wrong ~hen he placed freshmen as a separate species, 
Homo Infenor, and said that they were yet developing into Homo 
Sapiens. No, it is now quite clear that there is such a thing as freshman 
disease. 

"In my la~r~tory I have extensively tested many freshmen , allowing 
me to draw inSightful conclusions . It is rumored that this meeting was 

call~ bec~use several members of the Academic Senate thought little of 
mr. dl~ec~lo~; Let me assure you, they were quite necessary." 

Gwllotme! screamed a female drama professor, involved in knit-
ting . . 

Sigfreud smiled and continued . "First, I had to determine the cause of 
freshman disease, or in the Latin, infantus retardem. I could arrive at no 
other conclusion but that it was a combination of things, including 
notably, Coors beer, calculus, John Denver, and cafeteria food. Adding to 
this ~ot~ey ~ure and other equally disgusting paraphernalia, is the 
association With fellow freshmen , This is the causal force which 
generates an enzyme reaction making for too little acetyl choline 
esterase which in turn stifles the movement of brain cells." 

" Incredible," gasped the assembly as one. 
"Yes, isn't it," said Sigfreud. " Additionally, I have isolated a germ that 

lies dormant in the brains, if you'll excuse the expression, of all fresh-
men, which when activated by the enzyme reaction, causes a mild fonn 
of insanity over a certain period of time." 

"No more than a year?" questioned one professor concernedly. 
Sigfreud looked grave. "For most individuals, yes, but then there are 

those cases such as Donald S_egretti, Carlo Rossi, Paul Saltman, and 
Charo who seem to be permanent retainers of freshman disease. 

"Obviously from this you can see that there are more virulent strains of 
freshman disease. Take the Revelle freshman for example. You can osee 
how the disease takes on a new fonn: masochism. 

"Which leacls us to the overwhelming question, a topic which should 
spur us past our perpetual stumbling block, our misguided hobbyhorse 

" 

"I still wanna know how many fairies dance on the head of a pin," 
shouted a physics professor_ "I wanna know, I wanna know," 

"1 believe at our last meeting we determined the number at 144," said 
Sigfreud, trying to continue_ 

"Gross pig," shouted an irate literature professor. "1 am convinced the 
number is 1765." 

All hell broke out in the hall while 
professors screamed numbers out.

combination Miâ¬key Mouse/~piro

the formation of Citizens for Safe

Henderson believes that groups 
like CSR are "very healthy," and 
he supports the input of the lay 
community. He also supports the 
idea that recombinant DNA 
research is not only a scientific 
issue. 

" I'm delighted to see lay interest 
in academic science," Henderson 
said, and added that he is com-
mitted to the idea of an " informed

We would like to take this op-
portunity to thank all the staff and 
faculty who have been besieged by 
our never-ending quest for the an-
swers to your questions. How-
ever, so as not to spoil the image 
most students seem to have of staff 
and faculty, we won 't single anyone 
out in particular , but merely say 
thank you. We also thank those 
students without whose questions 
this column could never have been 
possible. Keep bringing them in. 

Dear Doc: Is Roger Revelle his 
real name? 

Yes. 

Dear Doc: What bas bappened to 
the cute bunnies hopping around 
Matthews late at nlgbt? There don't 
eem to be as many anymore. 
The bunnies are still around, they 

just haven't adjusted to going off 
Daylight Savings Time yet. We 
found plenty of them hopping around 
the Veterans Hospital Friday morn-
ing at about 4. 

In the iall the bunnies behave in a very similar manner to college students. They 
spend a IJt of time in their warrens getting to know other rabbi ts of the opposite sex. 
Accordin 1 to a rabbit spokesanimal, Fiver, the rabbits also don't need to be out as 
much sc~ v~ging for food . " Used to be," he said, "we had to spend many hours looking 
for food. Now, with students littering so much, there is a good deal of food for us just 
lying arolrxl . We thank you." 

Dear Voc: Was there a fire in the Third College Chemi try Research Building 
'ometime around Nov. 4? II so, what happened? 

First, we would like to set aside the rumors that a deranged chemistry student was 
trying to create Hfe inside Paul Saltman, fa iled, and then set his collection of unof-
ficial transcr ipts on fire. That simply is not what happened. Nei ther is it true that any 
departments, in anticipation of a visit from the auditor, tried to de troy the separate 
s t of books. Those books are still in their proper place behind the office water cooler. 

What actually happened was that some of the students sta rted playing with 
something they did not understand-electricity. An lectric motor overhea ted and

started smoking. When this flagrant violation of university regulations occurred, the 
campus police were cailed in. They in turn put the San Diego SWAT Squad on ready 
alert. 

Acting with their usual cool and insightful judgement to which we students have 
become accustomed, the campus police unplugged the motor and thereby stopped the 
smoking. According to the 25 page report on the incident, there was no appreciable 
damage. 

Dear Doc: On Friday Nov. 5, several administrative offices [Including the cashier's 
office 1 took extended lunch breaks due to a student organizations canlval. Were 
these administrators being paid duriog the time tbey were at&ending tbe carnival? 

The quick answer is yes; all staff employees were granted administrative leave I 
with pay. However, your question seems to imply another one-When is ad-
ministrative leave with pay granted? 

According to the Policy and Procedure Manual, Staff Personnel Policy 425 
"provides for administrative leave with pay for certain events and activities." 
Employees may be granted time off for jury duty or to attend administrative or legal 
proceedings where the employee is either appearing on behalf of the University ; the 
employee is subpoenaed; or the employee is a party or an expert witness. 

In addition, time off with pay is granted so an employee may exercise voting 
privileges, donate blood, or when a public emergency arises. Fina)]y, and this is the 
section that applies to the carnival attendance, time elf with pay is granted so the 
employee may attend University functions as designated by the (UC) President of the 
Chancellor. 

Chancellor McElroy issued a letter to all employees encolD'aging them to par-
ticipate in the carnival. He designated the function a University function and granted 
an extended lunch break so that they could attend.

Plastic Sport 
Layne Oaks and his skateboard are flashing through a series of 

freestyle tricks and turns that has the surrounding spectators oohing all ')) 
aahing and clapping and digging it. 

Oaks does a Walk-the-Dog-kickÂ·flip-toe-spin-Space-Walk-360-720-1080-
around-and-around-and-oohwee-baby combination that the crowd loves. 

"Do it, Layne!" 
" Oww! Oww!" 
"UNREAL!" 
Which is the kind of response that skateboarding generates these days . 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 
Skateboarding is experiencing a boom similar to the explosion that big-

cousin surfing went through in the early GO's. Like surfing, skateboarding 
has made the Big Time because of recent developments in equipment 
materials and design. The advent of urathane wheels and fiberglass 
boards has done the same thing for skateboarding that the introduction of 
polyurathane foam and fiberglass cloth did for surfing. In both sports, 
these developments made possible completely new ways of riding a 
board. New styles, new tricks, new places to take the vehicle came about. 

It is all a matter of plastics.

Last Saturday the UCSD Surf Club held its First Annual Skateboard 

Championships. A couple dozen contestants competed in downhill, 
freestyle, and slalom events. ) ) 

It was,like, wow, man, very hot. 
â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

r i9 Afle< its )oog'" unbe., .. ,tring ~. of the season, the UCSD field 
Steve Luck has one foot on his coo-sturn deluxe hold-on-tight-

everything-will-be-all-right downhill-racer skateboard. The board is 
made out of a no-flex rocket-shaped hardwoo.d plank that is covered with 
strips of nO:slip sure-grip lough-and-rough composition paper which has 
two precision-tight racing trucks holding four day-glo burnt-orange 
wider-than-round urathane wheels mounted to it. 

Luck's other foot rocks on the ground to the high-frequency soundÂ· 
BEEP! - of the electronic timer with the automatic digital readout that 
has to show, for Luck to win this race, a time of about seventeen seconds Â· 
BEEP! - when and if Luck makes it to the bottom of the steep hazardous 
service road north of the Central Library that threatens to turn the body 
of any skateboarder that challenges it into a patch of overripe 
strawberries. - BEEP! - Luck is wearing kneepads, elbow pads, leather 
gloves, and a plastic helmet for whatever they might be worth if he 
happens to kiss the cement curb going 30 MPH. - BEEP! - But he is not 
worried about falling now because the start of a downhill race is critical 
and - BUHP! - he shoves off into a one-legged run, driving with his free 
foot, picking up speed, then shifts his weight forward over the front 
wheel, does a couple of giddy-up body twitches, and settles into 'a position-
of-least-air-resistance tube-tuck.

hockey team closed its season 
Thursday, losing to Palomar JC, 1-
O. 

Coming into the game the 
Tritons had earned two draws and 
a victory in their last three mat-
ches. Despite continuing to play its 
best hockey of the season, UCSD 
was unable to upset its strong 
visiting opponents. 

Palomar scored in the first half, 
working the ball to both wings and 
down the field in its scoring drive. 

UCSD played the ball too much 
down the center of the field and 
thus were easily defensed. 

In the second half Palomar 
controlled the ball for most of the 
period. The Tritons' only scoring 
chances came on a few breakaway 
runs. 

Although UCSD finished in the 
bottom half of the division stan-

It all looks a lot like ski jumping without any air time. 
In a rush and a sign, Luck's run is over. His time: 16.736 seconds. 
The winner .. . 

â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

Stakeboarding is operating at that level of inclusive intensity so 
common in young people's cultic sports. 

If you are into It, you watch It and talk It and do It full-on all the time. 
And if you do not enjoy the riding, the lingo, the pictures, the blonde hair, 
and the latest equipment designs it's like, well, " Later on, chump, I put 
these really fine new wheels on my board so gotta go see how they work." 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

The slalom was the final event of the competition. While freestyle 
skateboarding is very tricky and artsy, and the downhill is fast and 
ballsy, the slalom combines all of these ingredients into one every 
ultimate-wow event. 

The slalom is fast, not flat-out fast, but, instead, quickÂ·fast, as the rider 
must pump his board around the plastic cones that make up the course. 
But style is also very evident as each rider has his or her own turning-
weaving, left-right, back-and-forth, whoosh-whoosh, method for working 
through the course. 

Division winners Steve Bernstein, Luck; and Oaks each won with a 
distinctive style. Their link was the medium plastic. 

It's more than kid's stuff.
