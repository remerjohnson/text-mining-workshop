ANN ARBOR, Mich. - The 
University of Michigan's 
"Campaign for Michigan" 
fundraising drive has collected 
more than $1 billion over the 
last four years, representing 
the largest amount ever raised 
by a public institution for one 
event. Donors have given a 
total of S 1.02 billion, includ-
ing $809 million in new gifts 
and pledges and $215 million 
in new bequest intentions, 
which are gifts willed to the 
university. The funds will be 
used for student scholarships, 
academic programs and 
faculty-supported improve-
ments to campus facilities. 
University officials say they 
plan to raise an additional 
$100 million during the final 
17 months of the campaign.

UCSD Dedicates New Fusion Lab 
PLASMA: $1.3 million 
facility is part of an 
international project 
By Trlca. Dey 
Staff Writer 

UCSD, in collaboration with the 
U.S . Department of Energy 
(D.O.E.), recently completed con-
struction of a facility that will be 
used to study nuclear fusion as a 
viable energy source and focus on 
practical application.

principal investigator at the new lab

of hydrogen are fused to produce a 
helium alom. To cause a fusion re-
action, atoms must be converted into 
praSnla, which consists of charged 
ions and electrons and is considered 
the fourth state of matter after the 
solid, liquid and gas states. 

School of Engineering research 
scientist Stan Luckhardt heads one 
of the projects, which involves test-
ing the metal beryllium as a'poten-
tial inner-containment wall for fu-

vital to barrier walls that contain 
plasma.

Student Organizations Tell A.S. They 
Want To Improve Relations, Add Space 
COUNCIL: Graduate Student 
Association wants to take over 
old Women's Center spot 
By Laura Lamb 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council addressed the concerns of 
members of various student organizations at last 
night's meeting, including Graduate Student Asso,. 
ciation (GSA) President Steve Dubb's continued 
disappointment with competition between councils 
for student lounge space, as well as student organi-
zation representatives' desire for better relations 
with the council and administrators. 

Dubb expressed opposition to the council's 
decision to uphold its May 8 proposal seckina the 
acquisition of Student Center space, which was in 

direct conflict with the GSA's own proposal. 
Dubb felt that the GSA's history of commit-

ment to Student Center interests and the currenl 
lack of graduate·allocated space justified the A.S.' s 
withdrawal of its proposal. 

"[The GSA's acquisition ofthe space) is nec-
essary for the improvement... of student life on 
this campus," Dubb said. 

Dubb previously presented the council with his 
concerns regarding the conflict on May 15, mak-
ing a request at that time for the A.S. to withdraw 
its proposal. The council, however, decided not to 
honor the request. 

The space in question, currently occupied by 
the Women's Resource Center (WRC), is ap-
proximately 750 to 765 square feet. The GSA's 
current Student Center offices encompass 685

To Extend 
Passing Time 
ASSEMBLY: Faculty also 
votes to adopt revamped 
admissions model 
By Mary HlgcJns 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's Representative As embly con-
vened Tuesday for its final meeting of the 
academic year, voting to mail·ballot everal 
controversial proposals, including change 
in the passing time between classes, new 
UCSD admissions criteria, and the Univer· 
sity of California's ties to several national 
laboratories. 

During the three-hour meeting, the Rep-
resentative Assembly voted to change the 
passing period between classes from 10 
minute to 15 minute , beginning in Fall 
Quarter 1997. UCSD facu lty will vote on 
the proposal by mail ballot before enacting 
any change. 

Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
Markus Wong, who also erves as the A.S. 
representative to the Representati ve A em-
bly, suggested that the pa ing period vote 
be postponed because he claimed recent, 
informal polls indicated that students were 
opposed to the schedule change. 

"We will need this [increased passing 
period] when the campus expands, but now 
it's not needed," Wong said. 

One assembly member, who wished to 
remain anonymous, supported the change, 
which he said would reduce the number of 
tudents arriving late to class and leaving 

early. 
Hesaid that many students schedule back· 

to-back classe and are unable to fo llow 
their schedules because new classroom are 
being built further away from the center of 
campus. 

"We cannot go on the way we are now," 
he said. "Future construction is going to 
make it worse, and we are already in a 
desperate situation." 

The motion to po tpone the vote was 
unsuccessful, and the amendment passed.

ried out during Tuesday's meeting, the Com-
mittee on Admissions introduce4 its new

UCSD Astrophysicist 
Uncovers Key Figure 
SPACE: David TytJer deduces the correct amount 
of baryonic matter in the universe 
By Kuen SIronC 
Guardian Reporter 

Thanks to new research by 
UCSD astrophysicist David Tytler, 
the scientific community is one 
stepcloserto understanding afun-
damental propeny ofthe universe, 

Tytler and his research group, 
which includes graduate students 
Xiao-Ming Fan and Scott Buries, 
were able to accurately deduce the 
amoun~ of baryonic maUer, sub-
atomic particles with measurable 
mass, in the uni-
verse. 

verse. 
However, deuterium has been 

continually destroyed since the Big 
Bang, mainly because itconverts to 
helium during fusion reactions in a 
star's core. To get accurate mea-
surements, the scientists had to per-
form research pertaining to previ-
ous astrophysical environments that 
had not already gone through the 
cycle Qf stellar furnaces, 

Tytler and his group conducted 
a four-year search to find a quasar 

whose light had 
passed through a 
suitably cool and 
primordial gas 
cloud on its way to 
Earth , Por this 
search they used 
the Lick Observa-
tory in San Jose. 

The amount of 
baryonic matter is 
an important con-
stant used in cal -
culations involv-
ing the formation 
of galaxies and in 
determini ng the 
future of the uni-
verse - whether it 
will eventually col-
lapse upon itself or 
continue toexpand 
indefinitely. 

Currently, most 
astrophysici sts be-

lie~e that the uni-
verse began with 
an explosion that 
came from a single 
point of nearly in-
finite density -
the so-called Big 
Bang theory. 

According to 
the theory, debris

Once the scien-
tists found an ap-
propriate quasar 
and gas cloud, they 
obtained spectro-
scopic measure-
ments. 

They used the 
Keek telescope in 
Hawaii to deter-
mine the cloud's 
deuterium-hydro-
gen ratio, which 
should be equiva-
lent to the primor-
dial deuterium-hy-
drogen ratio, The

and gradually condensed to fonn 
galaxies, stars and other celestial 
bodies. Baryons - which include 
fonns of ordinary matter, like pro-
tons and neutrons - were some of 
the first panicles formed after the 
Big Bang. 

A few seconds after the explo-
sion, baryons combined into four 
i otopes of hydrogen, helium and 
lithium - 2H, 3He, 'He and 'Li. If 
the total number of one of these 
isotopes in the universe can be 
found , scientists can figure out the 
total number of baryons in theuni-
verse. 

Deuterium (2H) is the beSI iso-
tope available for determining the 
amount of baryonic matter in the 
universe because it is the most 
sensitive one to changes in the 
universe's baryonic density. 

Because the Big Bang theory 
claims that the panicles were uni-
formly scattered, the amount of 
deuterium present should be the 
same at every point in the uni-

universe. 
Because of the high quality of 

Tytlet's data, the study provides 
the mosl preeise measure 10 daJf of 
the deuterium-hydrogen ratio. 
Tytler detennined that the density 
of baryonic matter in the universe 
is about five times higher than pre-
viously estimated. 

"The density of baryons in the 
universe is one of the few cosmo-
logical constants - it 's a really 
basicnumber,likeknowingthesize 
or mass or the Earth," Tytler said , 

Tytler added that the baryon 
density is used extensively in cos-
mological and astrophysical calcu-
lations. Because particles with mass 
- like baryons - tend to gravitate 
together, the baryonic density af-
fects how galaxies were ronned in 
the universe and how large the gal-
axies eventually became. 

The baryonic density can also 
be used to predict how the uni verse 
will behave in the distant future, If 
the total density of the universe is

The WRC's fu ture move to a

Campus Office Director Ingrtd 
Benedict supported the A.S.' s with-
drawal of its current proposal, citing 
the current lack of student aware-
ness as to the existence of the GSA. 

"GSA need s the visibility,"

instrumental in drafting the AS, 's

connict. 
'There 's no question in my mind

Holve said , " /t' never been an

In other busi ness , A,S.

Representatives from Kai bigang 
Pilipino (KP) said they were con-

cerned regarding problems with the 
organization's May 18 dance. 

KP Activities Coordinator 
Shery l Carrillo explained that a 
current poli cy requiring each indi-
vidual entering the dance to be 
accompanied by a UCSD student 
"wasn' t vocally stated" and was 
never implemented until this par-
ticular dance, although it has ex-
isted fo r a year. 

She also alleged that the CSOs, 
who arrived 30 minutes late, as-
sumed an overly dominant role. 

"We were just really frustrated 
that night," Carrillo said, 

According to KP members, the 
fund raising dance lost $450, rather 
than making the potential $1,500, 
because CSO turned away non-

A Clifni8ngar: Student. 
Should Save the Cliff. 

Picture this: It's your freshman year, and you and 10 of your 
closest friends are hiking to the Cliffs to walch the sunset As 
the sun slowly sinks to the horizon, you talk about your lives 
and your loves, your hopes and your dreams, and your fears 
about things that go bump in the night. 

The Cliffs, part of the Scripps Coastal Reserve, are open for 
everyone to enjoy - but if the same people that enjoy the 
brilliant sunsets and the peaceful moonrises continue to leave 
their trash behind, bike through the wilderness and obliterate 
the fragile ecosystem, things will never be the same. 

Students have enjoyed the Cliffs since they became part of 
the University of California Natural Reserve System in 1981, 
Unlike other wilderness reserves in the state, the university's 
reserves are devoted to teaching and research purposes. 

For a time, university administrators put up with the 
destruction. But Isabelle Kay, academic coordinator of the 
reserve, has had enough. If things continue the way they are 
going now, Kay says the university may be forced to close 
the reserve at night. 

A gate may sound harmless, but it is only the first step. In 
a few years, when most of us have moved on to bigger and 
better things, the Cliffs may be closed for good. No more 
sund, no more deep conversations by the moonlight, and 
the end to one of the last truly wild places in the University 
of California 

And none of us wants that. 

Which Students Flrstl? 
It's not only laughable, but ludicrous: The Student's 

First! slate - which recently swept the A.S. elections by 
promising to put student interests before all others - has 
already begun breaking its word. The A.S. councilmembers 
displayed their lack of commitment to students, and at the 
same time exposed their ignorance and double standards, 
when they required the California Review's staff to answer 
charges of racism in one of its advertisements. 

The A.S. should have remembered its progressive 
position concerning Voz Fronteriza when it published an 
anicle entitled "Die Migra Pig" last summer, calling for the 
murders of Border Patrol agents. At that time, the A.S. 
announced that it could not and would not infringe upon 
Voz Fronteriza's right to free speech. Moreover. the A.S. 
has hever questioned Voz Fronteriza's frequent use of 
racist, sexist and homophobic terminology. Hypocritically, 
the A.S. refused to defend, without question, the Review's 
right to free expression. 

Furthermore, the entire incident is a portrait of ignorance 
on parade. Yes, the hoods and robes does remind one of the 
Ku Klux Klan, and yes, the Review does not know how to 
design an ad that succinctly expresses what the paper's staff 
wants to say. However, even the most foolish of us can see 
that the man being telTorized is white - hardly the popular 
image of a victim associated with the KKK. The A.S. 
should have looked at the entire ad, rather than part of it. 

Finally, the A.S. (or Students First! - the two terms 
seem interchangeable these days) should never have brought 
forward the Review to answer charges of racism, consider-
ing Students First! main tenet is to place student interests 
above all others. If Students First! cannot protect the 
interests of all students - no matter what their political 
leanings - it shouldn't pretend to do so.

COMMENTARY: Frequent cases of police brutality are not abberations, but rather indications of how law 
enforcement in general has moved from protecting society to exercising authority 

POLICE HAVE FORGO,!yrEN THEIR TRUE DU'!lES 
Staff Writer 

Few things are as disturbing as 
turning on the evening news and 
seeing that another episode of po-
lice brutalily has been caught on 
tape. On April I of this year, a 
news chopper from KCAL-TV in 
Los Angeles recorded the tail end 
of an SO-mile, high-speed chase 
from Temecula to South EI Monte. 
During the roughly 15 seconds of 
footage, officers from the River-
side County sheri ff's office are 
seen beating two alleged illegal 
immigrants. 

The disturbing thing about this 
incident was that the people 
beaten by the police were not 
armed, belligerent, or in any way 
res isting arrest. Yet the officers 
fe lt it within their power to use 
fo rce on these "dangerous" crimi -
nals. 

But maybe I' m failing to give 
these offi cers Ihe benefit of the 

doubt. This was, after all, a long, 
high-speed chase in which occu-
panls of the lruck hurled beer cans 
and pieces of the pickup's fiber-
glass camper shell al the pursuing 
officers. Moreover, Ihe driver of 
the truck attempted to sideswipe 
onlooking motorists to distract the 
officers. These were clearly not 
people concerned with the welfare 
of others. 

But were the officers justified 
in using their batons on people 
who finally surrendered without a 
struggle? Was the one officer who 
pulled the female from the truck 
by her hair justified in what he 
did'! The answer is a resounding 

uno . ~t 

Although the level of brutality 
seen in this incident does not even 
begin to match the beating that 
Rodney King received at the hand 
of L.A. police, there are similari-
ti es between the two episodes. Not 
the least of these similarities is the

American Civil Liberties Union 
was up in arms about the latest 
incident, and iniliated a campaign 
to introduce federal standards of 
conduct for police officers in-
volved in high-speed chases. Also, 
victims of the beating have filed 
multi-million dollar lawsuits 
against the Riverside sheriff's of-
fice and the officers involved. 

The most obvious similarity 
bel ween this incident and the 
Rodney King beating was the un-
justified and unnecessary use of 
force by the police offi cers in-
volved. Remember the dozens of 
limes that King was hit with night-
sticks? 

He sustained a concussion, a 
fra ctured c hee kbon e and eye 
socket, a fractured skull and a bro-
ken ankle. This is incredibly bru-
tal - especially when you con-
sider that there were at least a half-
dozen offi cers standing around 
King who were in a position to 

restrain him or any officer who got 
out of hand. 

Likewise, in this recent inci-
denl, the officers could and should 
have restrained the people they 
were pursuing. They should not 
have resorted to their billy clubs 
after screaming a few unintelli-
gible orders in English. a language 
that was definitely foreign to the 
victims. The officers should have 
cuffed these people and then gone 
off to apprehend the other immi-
grants who were fleeing the scene. 

Maybe I'm being unfair by sec-
ond-guessing these officers after 
the fact. They do, after all, work 
in a high -s tress environment. 
Maybe we should cut Ihem some 
slack. After all. aren ' t they traincd 
to know when and how to use 
force? 

Maybe so. But the real point 
seems to be that our law-enforce-
ment agencies have forgotten their

- the taxpayers - to keep us 
safe. That is their primary mission. 
They are not paid to use excessive 
force on the alleged "bad guys." 
Nobody wa rendered safer by the 
beating of these illegal immi -
grants. 

But it is not just California's 
law-enforcement agencies who 
need straightening out. Both fed -
eral and state agencies needo.lo be 
reminded that their primary mis-
sion is to "protect and serve" the 
law-ab ;ding public. A few ex-
amples are in order. 

The infamous Ruby Ridge ca\e 
involving Randy Weaver b a clas-
sic example of law enforcement 
gone awry. Becausc Weaver was 

of the word "oppressive." Several 
councilmembers, including 
Sabatini, Vice President External 
Alex Tom and Warren Senior 
Senator Michael Rodriguez, used 
that rather poor choice of words 
to describe the sentiment the ad 
evoked among the terminally race-
conscious. The press may at times 
outrage, entertain, enlighten, 
amuse or bore. But it does not "op-
press." Only governments can do 
that, including governments of the 
fifth-rate student variety. 

Properly understood, oppression 
is the use of government power and 
bureaucratic fiat to intimidate or 
subtly threaten . Read any great 
dystopian writer from Orwell to 

unwilling to cooperate with au-
thorities and testify against a man 
that he knew, federal agents en-
trapped him by selling him an il -
legal firearm. Authorities then 
used this purchase as an excuse to 
raid his isolated cabin. 

In the ensuing standoff, 
Weaver's wife and young child 
were shot dead by an FBI niper. 
Neither Weaver nor his family was 
a danger to anyone in the commu-
nity. Yet federal agents thought he 
was so dangerous that they or-
dered a siege of his property. It is 
obvious that in this case, law en-
forcement was neither protecting 
nor serving the public. 

Consider also the standoff in-
volving federal agents at David 
Koresh's Waco compound. Rather 
than simply arresting Koresh on 
one of his routine trips into town, 
federal agents raided his com-
pound and precipita ted a long 
standoff that ended in the fiery

Despite all that, we find it diffi-
cult to lay any real blame on theA.S . 
councilmembers for this embarrass-
ing and unfortunate spectacle. They 
are, after all, victims of the worst 
form of oppression: poor education. 
It was not their fault that they 
couldn't tell the difference between 
the Spanish Inquisition and cross-
burning Klansmen. Because igno-
rance is so rampant these days, it is 
practically expected that they would 
make such a mistake. 

Say what you will about the 
California Review. You may not 
agree with its politics, or you may 
find its writing amateurish, offen-
sive or both. But it is not racist. 

The California Review has long 

meshed in Kore h's cullic web,

Also consider the case of the 
Montana Freemen. While it is true 
that they have defrauded many in-
nocent citizens of thousands of 
dollars, federal authorities never-
theless have instigated a siege, 
which is now well into its second 
month. Instead of arresting these 
people one by one and making 
sure that they don't defraud any-
one again, federal authorities have 
succumbed to the "get the bad 
guy" mentality. 

And what about high -s peed 
chases? They are definitely a dan-
ger to public safety . Countless 
chases have ended in the deaths of 
innocent citizens. Why not pursue 
law breakers with helicopters in-
stead'!

believed that its mission is to shed 
light on a world of obfuscation and 
darkness by focusing on facts and 
history. The Review is attempting to 
better the university environment 
through the most ennobling activ-
ity of civilized man: conversation 
and discourse. 

It may not always succeed - its 
editors are students, too, after all. 
But it 's an honest goal, and a nec-
essary one, without which UCSD 
would be just a little bit poorer in-
tellectually. And as long as there are 
junior bureaucrat and resume-pad-
ding punks to make a mockery of 
the university, the Review will be 
there to make a mockery out of 
them. 

They should reevaluate their ways 
of doi ng business . First, they 
sJlould only use force when they 
are in imminent danger. Non-bru-
tal restraint should be their goal. 
Second, they should pursue crimi-
nals in a way that protects public 
safety and privacy. 

Third, they should get their pri-
orities straight on who the most 
dangerous elements in our society 
are. Then they should go after the 
most violent and troublesome of-
fenders . They should leave people 
like Randy Weaver - who is, 
granted. not a sai nt - to their own 
devices. 

II is a shame that our law-en-
forcement agents are so disre-
spected. They do a very danger-
ous job, and we ask a lot of them. 
Nevertheless, they must not be al-
lowed to forget that their mission 
is to protect and serve, not to play 
God and to gel Ihe bad guys at all

J'hunday, May 30, 1996 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 7 

CAllFORNIA REvIEW'S AD DID NOT RESEMBLE KKK 
EdItor: 

The recent accusations of white 
supremacy by the A.S. Council to-
ward the minority-run California 
Review are nothing but an insult 
with malicious intent. This witch 
hunt, conducted by the A.~ . tribu-
nal , not only violates the Review's 
right to freedom of the press, but it 
is outrighl slander. 

The A.S. incorrectly identified 
the picture of a 19th-century wood-
cut that appeared in the May 1996 
issue of the California Review. lib-
eral eXlremists immediately as-
sumed that the advertisement de-
picts members of the Ku Klux Klan. 
This accusation is absolutely un-
founded . The picture shows two 
executioners from the Spanish In-
quisition in cloaks, a cowering male 
awaiting death and a priest giving 
the man his last rites. The caption 
included with the ad stated, "We 
Can Help You," and simply stated 
that the Review can help those that 
are persecuted ideologically. 

The charge of white supremacy 
leveled al the California Review is 
a bogus one, and was aimed at our 
publication because of its dissent-
ing views of the A.S.'s liberal 
agenda. The California Review will 
not idly stand by whileA.S. extrem-
ists paint it as the poster child of 
white supremacy on campus. The 
offensive nature oftheA.S. govern-
ment and its apparent desire to re-
write history book.s by maki~g the 
victims of the Spanish Inquisition, 
one of the largest religious perse-
cutions in history, into victims of the 
Ku Klux Klan is ridiculous. 

The protection of UCSO's alter-
native media is a critical issue. Alter-
native media has the ability to expose 
campus issues that would otherwise 
not some to light. Indeed, this issue is 
at the heart of the AS. 's witch hunt. 
The California Review's headlining 
article for May was ''Targeting the 
A.S.," a detailed, critical analysis of 
the recent AS. elections. The anicle 
undoubtedly angered some council-
members due to its frankness about 
the intentions of the new, ultra-liberal 
council. The California Review will 
not and should not be a servant to the 
whims and political agenda oftheA.S. 
Council. 

Unfounded allegations by liberal 
council members have labeled the 
Review as "offensive and oppressive," 
something we most certainly are not. 
The question now becomes, "Who 
will be the next target of the A.S.?" 
Wi II they censorthe Koola for its lack 
of political correctness? What other 
emotional is ue besides racism, hate 
crimes and child prostitution will the 
A.S. use next to hide its inability to 
do its work and pass a budget? 

Don' t subscribe to the propa-
ganda put forth by extremists on the 
A.S. Council. Alternative media is 
a better representative of the stu-
dents at UCSO than a self-impor-
tant AS. Council.

SInging Trees Annoy 
Studying Students 
Editor: 

Has anyone else on this cam-
pus of ours been annoyed with the 
si nging trees behind the Student 
Health Center? When I first en-
countered these "talking" trees. I 
stood there entranced. I can re-
member hearing a faint sound 
coming from the center of the 
glade, but I did not see anyone 
there. When I eventually discov-
ered the source of the sound, , 
a quick double take. What a . " 
derful idea for an art project, I 
thOloght. 

That was until I started spend-
ing time in the Cognitive Science 
Building on a regular basis. I work 
in an office on the south side of 
that building, and from that loca-
tion it is quite impossible to keep 

from listening to these trees - or 
at least to the one that is closest to 
the building. 

One of the tunes this tree plays 
is a country-western song, which 
was interesting for the first sev-
eral times I heard it, but has be-
come so irritating after about the 
20th repetition that I find myself 
shutting the window and using 
earplugs in order to get my work 
accomplished. There are lots of 
people in this building who have 
had the same experience, so I 
know iI'S not just me. 

Is this still art? I don 't think so. 
lt would be an if the volume of 
the music were turned down far 
enough so that tho se forced to 
work right next to the trees didn't 
have to wear earplugs to get work 
done. It would be art if the tunes 
changed on occasion, or if they 
really did constitute background 
sound, like the hourly chiming of 
the clock bells. 

It would be art if the Cognitive 
Science Building could stand up 
and move back about a 1,000 feet 
or so, so that the sounds would bl. 
--fler. But in my opinion, project-
, ~ annoying, repeti~ive music to 
a C-rlpti ve audience does not con-

. , 
stltute art. . 

[' ve noticed that the volume of 
these songs has gone down a bit 
in the last month or so, and I ap-
preciate this, but it needs to go . 
down a bit further if the south face 
of the Cognitive Science Building 
is to be a locus for academic work.

"Now, the biggest experiments 
routinely produce fusion-reaction 
conditions of 200,000 million de-
grees Celsius or even hotter," 
Luckhardt said. 

.. Actually, there is enough knowl-
edge ript now [to build reactors). 
Our international partners, the Eu-
ropean Community and the Japa-
nese, are •.. likely to go ahead and 
build the next step," he added. 

Fusion holds many promises for 
the future, especially as a replace-
ment for fossil fuels. The "fuel" for 
a fusion reaction, hydrogen, is uni-
versally available, essentially inex-
haustible and can serve IS an effi-
cient fuel supply that scientists say 
has attractive safety and environ-

mental characteristics. 
"You can't keep dumping car-

bon dioxide and using fossil fuels 
through the 21 stcentury," Luckhardt 
said. '1'he thing that people dream 
of is to have a new technology for 
central electric-power generation .... 
It's a nuclear reaction, bul it's much 
safer [than traditional nuclear reac-
tors)." • 

Fusion research and development 
costs have immense economic ben-
efits whenconlrUlcd with expendi-
tures on traditional energy sources. 

The annual expendilure by U.S. 
consumers on gasoline and electric-
ity is currently in excess of $400 
billion. From I 950 to 1993, the fed-
eral government invested $25 bil-
lion in fusion research and develop-
menl - a relatively modest sum. 

In addition, plasma technologies 
developed for fusion will have ap-
plications throughout science and 
industry.

ing technologies. 

Charles Baker, direclor of the 
International Thermonuclear Ex-
perimental Reactor (ITER) project' 5 
U.S. home team, praised the inter-
national effort in fusion-energy re-
search. 

"It is exactly the type of research 
thaI should be done in the university 
setting," he said. "This medium-
sized facility is dedicated 10 a fun-
damental question that can later be 
applied to building a test reactor." 

Baker also presented certificates 
of appreciation to various individu-
als who were instrume~l in the 
planning and completion of the lab. 
Engineers and technicians from stlb-
contractor General Atomics were 
commended for their contributions 
in constructing the site. 

The.P.I.S.C.E.S. B laboratory is 
the newest addition to the fusion-
energy research programs in the San 
Diego area. UCSD has been allo-
cated a total of $8.9 million in fu-
sion-research funding by the D.O.E. 
for fiscal year 1996. 

Together with D.O.E. funding to 
local companies, including General 
Atomics, SAIC and Lockheed Mar-
tin, San Diego will receive a total of 
$54 million in fusion-research fund-
ing this year.

SENATE: 
Committee amends 
educational policy 
ContInued from ..... 1 . 
nia residency would no longer be 
considered as supplemental fac-
tors to admissions criteria. 

In place of the eliminalcd fac-
tors, a new supplemental factortiw 
considers "academic promise and 
potential in a limited educational 
and social environment" would be 
instated. The proposal will now be 
put to a facuhy mail ballot. 

The UCSD Committee on Edu-
cational Policy (CEP), chaired by 
Alden Mosshammcr, proposed sev-
eral amendments, all of which 
passed. 

The first amendment would re-
word the current rule regarding 
supervised special-studies courses 
so that students can only enroll in 
special-studies courses on a Passl 
No Pass basis, unless otherwise 
authorized by the CEP Subcom-
mittee on Courses. 

The second amendment would 
eliminate the inclusion of a minor 
in campuswide graduation require-
ments. Furthennore, the amend-
ment would increase the minimum 
requirement for a minor from 24 
units to 28 units, 20 of which must 
be accumulated in upper-division 
courses. 

The third amendment alters 
Warren College requirements so 
that students participating in the 
Education Abroad Program (EAP) 
may fulfill their Programs of Con-
centration at an EAP center, under 
cenain restrictions. 

Aside from on-campus issues, 
the assembly voted to reassess the 

" Thursday, May 30, 1996 

UC's relationship with three na-
tional - labs - Los Alamos, 
Lawrenc:eLivennore and Lawrence 
BerXeley. The assembly previously 
postponed a vote on the issue at the 
May 7 assembly meeting because 
not enough members were present 
to constitute a quorum. 

The assembly passed the 
amended resolution by a vote of 
22-11, deciding to negotiate a new 
contract with the labs and use rec-
ommendations made by the Uni-
versity Committee on Research 
Policy to improve UC relations with 
the national laboratories. 

In new business, Graduate Stu-
dent Association (GSA) President 
and Graduate Student Advisor to 
the Assembly SteveDubbproposed 
a six-month postponement of the 
implementation of dial-in Internet 
access fees for graduate students, 
undergraduates and faculty mem-
bers. 

Dubb said that the cost for post-
ponement would be relatively mi-
nor. He also argued that postpon-
ing the fees would provide an op-
portunity for students, staff and 
administrators to worX with a pro-
posed assembly task force to for-
mulate a dial-in modem policy that 
could meet the educational and re-
search needs of the UCSD commu-
nity. 

"[The GSA] isn't absolutely 
opposed to some user fee," Dubb 
said. "We realize that might be 
necessary." 

Dubb added, however, that a 
decision to hold off dial-in access 
fees might attract potential gradu-
ate students because it would en-
courage research. 

The assembly voted to postpone 
DUbb's motion indefinitely. 

After Finals ... 

COST: S60.00 fee provides unlimited Urgent Care visits during 
summer for continuing students. This fee does not 
include insurance. Other eligible student categories pay 
fee for service. Our usual charges for phannacy, dental 
and optometry services will apply. The Cramming ~egins! 

INSURANCE: Undergrads are stronlly urged to continue coverage 
during summer (VIP=S222.00). Breaks in coverage can 
result in claim denial due to "pre-existing" exclusions. 
Graduate, international and medical srudents who 
carried GSHIP during during spring are 
automatically covered for summer.

For those of 
you not taking 

The Edge: 
Some LSAT prep companies pretend to offer you a rabbit's foot 
for luck if you don't take their course. We fIgure, if you don't 
take our LSAT course, what you'd rather have is an extra $200, 
since that's how much more most of those other courses are 
going to cost you. If you decide, however, that you want to pay 
out all that extra money to go to the other guys, here are a few 
questions you should ask them first: 

• If I'm paying you 800 bucks, why are you only giving 
me a fraction of the available LSAT practice questions'! 

• Why do you pack so many students into one classroom? 

• If your instructors are so good, why don't you offer 
unlimited tutoring? 

• I f your instructors are so good, why do you subject 
your students to taped lectures and explanations? 

• If your results really have been verified by a big 
accounting firm, why won't you back them up with a 
money-back guarantee? 

Our courses for the October LSAT begin June 8 and August 10. 
Please call for more information.

However, Tytleremphasized that 
other massive particles could exist 
which contribute to the total density 
of matter in the universe. In fact, he 
said the figure at which he arrived is 
only five percent of the calculated 
critical density. Cosmologists call 
the other 9S percent "dark matter" 
because it cannot be detected by 
conventional means.

All Set 

I.R.I. Recllfll. 

-
* •• 

The past 20 years resulted in lit-
lie change for the much-revered 
Manchester punkers. the Buz-
zcocks, yet their latest release All 
Set is both a timely and welcome 
addition to any "complete" collec-
tion of punk-pop albums. 

Despite their long and decorated 
careers as one of the original 
groups of "grandfathers of punk," 
All Set is only the Buzzcocks' fifth 
studio album. 

Lea;i~g off from where their 
'93 return album Trade Test Trans-
missions started, All Set continues 
with much of the same buzzing pop 
riffs, cOllrtesy of guitarist Steve 
Diggle. 

The new album also features 
more of the band's wry lyrics about 
romantic frustration from Pete 
Shelley, which are comparable to 
his previous efforts. 

This is not to say that there is 
nOlhing new to be found in All Set, 
however. Although old fans will 
welcome tracks such as "Totally 
From the Heart," "Give it To Me," 
and "Your Love," a large portion of 
the tracks - including "Hold Me 
Close," and "Back With You" -
keep a slower, more alternative-
sounding tempo. 

The BUlzcocks may no longer 
play the hardest or fastest punk 
rock anymore, having been out-
aone by many groups whom they 
influenced. 

Nevertheless, they have proven 
that they have staying power, and 
continue to produce catchy punk 
songs that demand repeated listen-
ings.

The Malca-Up 
Destination: Love 

DI"",,~ 

-
• ••• 

Picking up where the Nation of 
Ulysses aesthetic left off, the 
Make-Up continues to spread its 
version of the trulh through its own 
brand of spirituality. 

Drawing on classic gospel and 
soul rifts, the Washington, D.C. 
foursome - made up of Ian Sveno-
nius, James Canty and Steve Gam-
boa from the Nation of Ulysses, as 
well as Michelle Mae from the 
Frumpies - toured England to 
record thi s "live" concept album, 
the group's first full-length release. 

Although it is often unfairly dis-
mis ed as a gimmick band due to 
their pseudo-religious messages 
and their wild stage antics, the 
Make-Up put out a so lid release in 
Destination: Love. It is refreshing 
to see artists with punk roots exper-
imenting with new sounds. While 
some songs are truly gospel-sound-
ing, complete with an organ and 
hymn-type lyrics, other songs 
sound straight off a Best of Motown 
Soul record. 

The end re ull is not what one 
would expect from an ex-Nation of 
Ulysses band, but the new direction 
taken is creative and enrapturing.

It seems like every band reaches 
a point in its career when it is no 
longer able to compose any new 
songs - a point marked by the 
group trying to rehash its past 
musi(! styles. For some odd reason, 
the band, Avail, seems to have 
reached that point rather quickly. 

You can hardly blame the band 
members for this lack of innova-
tion. When they released their sec-
ond album, Dixie, in 1994, people 
took notice. Their gro~ndbreaking 
mixture of powerful emotion and 
hard-core rhythms was played with 
such creative energy that it would 
have been difficult for any band to 

Thursday, May 30, 1996 

. follow up on such a strong effort. 
The group's new release, 4 

A.M. Friday, contains the same 
fast, punchy sound that made 
Dixie a hit, but lhis latest effort 
lacks the emotional edge of its 
predecessor. The end result is an 
unoriginal album which comes off 
sounding too much like The Off-
spring. 

The only nuance to the album is 
the band's almost laughable back-
ing vocals, which sound as though 
they were lifted out of a' 50s horror 
movie soundlrack. 

Nevertheless, for those who 
have never heard Avail's previous 
releases. Dixie or Live at the King's 
Head Inn. 4 A.M. Friday might 
seem like a good album.

The latest release from Spoon, 
Telephono, hooks the listener 
immediately with a sound some-
where between the Cars and Nir-
vana. 

The band's sweet melodies 
deliver without coming across as 
overproduced sell-out material. 

The opening track, "Don't Buy 
the Realistic," comes soaring out of 
a cloud of feedback and takes off 
from there. 

Other notables from Teleplwno 
include a catchy trio of heart-
wrenching tunes, "Cvantes," "Dis-
member" and the band's cover of 
aMiniature's ''Towner.'' 

A track just waiting to explode 
is "Nefarious" - a tune the band 
previously released on a three-song 
EP - which includes vivid vocals 
like, "S he was smoking up all his 
cigarettes/And putting them out in 
his hands." 

In fact, almost all of the 14 
tracks could be considered hit fod -
der. The album's only drawback is 
its all -too-short 35-minute running 
time, which leaves the listener hun-
gry for more.

In six yean, Ani DiFnnco has 
produced eight albums, and each 
album consists of a new innovation 
she adds to her solo female act. 

In DillJle, DiFnnco's newest 
musical creation., she is able to 
exert her pure musical talent vi. 
her raw strumming on the acoustic 
guitar. In addition, she includes 
instruments such as the hammond 
organ and steel guitar, which pro-
vide a complcx nature to many of 
the songs on the album. 

DiFranco's innovations are 
what make the album respectable, 
but al the same time, they neglect 
some of the characteristics that 
make her music so profound. 

The last track, "Joyful Girl," is 
one of the few songs off the album 
that sound at all similar to her pre-
vious work.

When listening to Elvis Costel-
lo and the Attractions' latest 
release. AU This Useless Beauty, 
one might wonder who the Attrac-
tions are. This is because the album 
is pennelled with just one thing: 
the crooning voice of Elvis Costel-
lo. 

Costello has a knack for fusing 
melodic pop with rock and blues. 
In his latest release, All This Use· 
less Beauty, this ability is evident. 
His new album features an even 
greater blend of musical genres. 

Another interesting feature on 
this album is Costello's songwrit-
ing. The songs on this album are 
Costello's covers of songs he wrote 
earlier for other artists . This

The UCSD Guardian 

In her debut album, Between the 
I and the 9, Patti Rothberg joins 
the ranks of pop vocalists Sheryl 
Crow and Alanis Morisette. Roth-
berg is a woman with a guitar and a 
message. Her strong, but annoying-
ly childlike voice bangs a familiar 
drum, as she sings about relation-
ships, life, love and rage. 

Rothberg regurgitates a generic 
style that has carried similar anists 
to the top of the charts, only to be 
forgotten . Rather than breaking 
new ground with this release, the 
result is a trite. and markellble, 
collection. 

This album's strength is in its 
delivery of simple messages 
through a diverse musical range. 
Rothberg covers all vocals, lead 
and bass guitars, and Adrian 
Harpham comes through on drums, 
tambourine and cymbals. Together, 
these two show a streak of eccen-
tricity and talent amid the album's 
more obvious weaknesses.

Nobody forgets those' catchy 
educational tunes that would 
emanate from every child's televi-
sion set come Saturday morning. 
"Schoolhouse Rock!" is back and 
this time it is better than ... Ezra. 

The newly released School-
house Rock! Rodes album remiles 
the original tunes with a '90s edge, 
without diminishing the original 
appeal of the timeless '70s and '80s 
hits. Classics such as "Conjunction 
1unction," 'Three Is a Magic Num-
ber" and "I'm Just a Bill" are per-
formed by Better Than Ezra, Blind 
Melon and Deluu Folk Implosion, 
respectively. Other contributors 
include Man or Astro-Man?, Pave-
ment, Buffalo Tom, Ween, Biz 
Marlcie and Skee·Lo. 

Through the decades School-
house Rock! has strived to educate 
children and adults alike through 
entertainment - a hard combina-
tion to come by. The album contin-
ues this commitment to educating 
children by donating proceeds to 
the Children's Defense Fund.

-* ••• 

Alternating between a hard·dri-
ving elplosivc sound and one that 
is slower and more melodic, the 
Washington D.C.-based punk trio 
known as the Crownhate Ruin 
released its first album, Until the 
Eagle Grins, on Dischord Records. 

The music of the Crownhaae 
Ruin draws upon the style of the 
anti-stars of Olympia, known as 
Unwound, and combines that with 
the pummelling drum beats and 
guitar chords of the San Diego 
punk foursome, Drive Like Jebu. 

At times during the album, ii is 
actually difficult to distinguish the 
Crownhate Ruin from Unwound, 
althoughl Ruin doesn't steal any 
sounds from its predessesor. The 
Crown hate Ruin is successful at 
taking one style and reworking it 
into its own quality sound. Other 
contributing elements to Until the 
Eagle Grins include the musical 
mastery of Hoover and June of '44, 
both of whom make up the band.

COSTELLO: 
British vocalist 
returns in sty Ie 
ContInued from INC. 13 
Other End of the Telescope," 
which changes perspectives mid-
stream - a stylistic ploy preva-
lent throughout the album .. While 
the next song, "Little Atoms," is a 
filler track, the rest of the cuts are 
consistently well done. The songs 
"Why Can't a Man Stand Alone" 
and "Poor Fractured Atlas" are 
worth playing more than once. 

Also worthy of recognition is 
the sharp tune, "It' Time," which 
takes a different musical 
approach from Costello's other 
pieces by combining a faster pace 
with background harmony. 

This most recent release of 
Elvis Costello and the Attractions 
has definitely hit a fork in the 
road. While their music has 
always possessed a somewhat 
cynical undertone, thi s album 
takes that notion a step further. 
Here, the songs are no longer 
about the mysteries of life and the 
complexities of loving women. 

Instead, it is as though these 
men have just begun to see the 
truth. The message here is not one 

of anger or accusation; it is one 
of quiet, pitiful resignation. 
Costello is now singing about 
pointless tears, the attempt to 
reclaim youth and useless 
dreams. The resultant music is 
replete with broken hopes and 
subtle sensuality, sliding along as 
a vivid combination of lyrical 
ballads and brief moments of 
rage and comedy. 

The album combines a broad 
mix of rhythm, instrumentation, 
incredible poetry and a beauti ful 
voice which preaches reality. 
This groundbreaking work is an 
innovati ve and stylistic gem.

I didn ' t get that. Sometimes I 
think we have a particular lack of 
mellow, we certainly are a pop rock 
band. If anything, our fault would 
be being very mid to up tempo. We 
always have a couple of low song 
on the record, but that certainly 
doesn't seem to dominate our out-
put. 

I'm actually a really big fan of

upcomin& San Die,o show? 
We like San Diego, we' ve 

played there before. We've played 
at the Casbah twice. The last time 
we played at the new Casbah, 
which is just as mall as the old 
Casbah. That's omething that 
always amazed me. San Diego is a 
pretty big town and it is, by far, one 
of the smallest places we've ever 
played at. 
How do you Ike belnc the 
openinc band for the 
Po ... ? 

It 's one of those situation 
where we're great admirers of the 
Posies and in our eyes, they' ve 
been around longer, they have 
more albums out, and they can rock 
your ass off. 

We will gladly defer the head-
lining position to them when and 
wherever prudent, which is most 
places. 
Who is ihe other band 
you're playing with here in 
San Diego? 

I believe it 's Fuzzy. Fuzzy rock 
a camel's ass. They're funky fresh. 
They're a great band out of Boston, 
Mass. 

We've just come off of five 
weeks on the road where we were 
out with them and another Wash-
ington band called Chisel.

Spy Hard 
Nielsen 

delivers cliched 
comedy role 

By Peter Chang 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD Guardian 

One of the most established 
trademarks of Hollywood is its 
inability to leave good ideas alone. Spy I..-der: Nicollette Sheridan (left) stars with Leslie Nielsen. 

However, in a world of fickle 
consumer tastes, it is often easier to 
rework existing plots and charac-
ters than it is to write 
something original. As a 
result, moviegoers are 
constantly bombarded 
with overworked sequels 
and actors repeati ng the 
same cliched role, movie 
after movie. In thc most 
recent version of this 
common debacle. Leslic 
Nielsen plays aj!cnt WD-40 in the 
overdone spoof-fest, Spy Hard. 

Being touted as a James 
Bond/Die Hard parody with "all 
the women," "all the action" and 
"half the intelligence," Spy Hard is 
a hodgepodge collection of rejected 
Naked Gun gags. Casual observers, 
who initially might think that "half 
the intelligence" means the film 
will bo a good-natured aUempt at 
self-deprecation, are forced to con-
clude after 90 minutes that "half' 
the intelligence is, at best, reckless 
self-flauery on the part of the 
movie's writers. 

The funniest sequence in Spy 
Hard turned out to be the introduc-
tory credit sequence, as "Weird AI" 

Yankovic bells out the 
movie's theme song ~ 
which is complemented 
by seductive si lhouelles 
of slim women (some of 
whom aren't quitc so 
slim) swimming in the 
background, just like the 
opening crcdits for any 
good 007 flick. The 

remaining 87 minutes is a laborious 
tribute to Hollywood at its worst. 

The story, if it can be called that, 
begins with Agent WD-40 on a top-
secret mis ion that concludes with 
the detonation of an enemy heli-
copter, sending WD-4Os nemesis, 
Rancor (played by Andy Griffith), 
into oblivion. However, the plot 
thickens, as 15 years later, Rancor 
(minus two arms due to the explo-
sion) returns to the international 
terrorism scene, threateni ng to 
blow up the world with a stolen 
missile system. 

Agent WD-40, who has long 

since been retired, is called back 
into action by his former superiors 
to stop Rancor's evil plot. Then, in 
the tradition of previous Leslie 
Nielsen spoofs, the movie parodies 
begin. Ftom action films In lire Line 
of Fire to Pulp Firrion to Golden-
eye. a predictable stream of jokes is 
launched as Nielsen is en route to 
save the world from the evil Rancor 
and his heinous henchmen. 

Silly gags and lame jokes, such 
as when Rancor says, "You would-
n't hurt an unarmed man now, 
would you," are the rule. However, 
these are skits which were only 
remotely clever or original in 
Nielsen's first film of this genre, 
Naked Gun. Therefore, if you've 
watched Naked Gun or any of its 
sequels, you've already seen 90 
percent of Spy Hard. 

Save yourself the agony of this 
horrendous waste of time and rent 
an old "Police Files" tape. 
Nielsen's shtick is funnier the first 
time around. 

Spy Hard is playing in theaters 
across San Diego.

DIFRANCO: 
Feminist singer 
comes to San Diego 
Continued from page 13· 

Over the last half decade, 
DiFranco has increasingly 
experimented with her music. 
She has finally reached a point 
where the experimentation has 
given way to the creation of 
original music that distinctly 
markets her name. 

Dilate marks the turning point 
in her career, highlighted by her 
powerful cover of John Newton's 
"Amazing Grace." This is the 
first non-original track she has 
recorded in her career. 

DiFranco recorded this advo-
cacy of patriotism in the Con-
gress House Studio in Austin, 
Texas. 

She included a sound bite of 
an answering machine with a 
woman's complacent voice stat-
ing some of the rare lyrics from 
"Amazing Grace." 

Along with this ode to Amer-
ica, DiFranco included two of 
her songs which have become 
favori tes amid her fan in live 
performances. 

"Napoleon" and "Untouch-
able Face" are the two most-
requested concert songs made by 
her die-hard admirers. 

Both are easi ly recognized by 
the use of every musician 's 
favorite word, "fuck." However, 
DiFranco utilizes its meaning in 
a completely different genre than 
ever heard before. 

DiFranco is capable of creat-
ing a song about every emotional 
state on the human scale.

01 Righteous 
Dilate: Singer Ani DiFranco will 
perform songs from new album 
at Soma LIVE on Saturday. 

Through Dilate, she releases her 
frustration by criticizing the 
music industry. 

The title track proclaims: "I 
see you and I'm so unsatisfied, I 
see you and I dilate." 

"Di late" continues with 
DiFranco's retort to life, the 
music industry and all that it 
entails. 

This album cannot be listened 
to casually - every word 
requires individual attention, and 
every note provokes emotion. 

Ani DiFranco has succeeded 
in creating another phenomenal 
album, and she can be trusted to 
conti nue to devise new material 
and spearhead her crusade 
through the music industry.

Similarly, the women will be 

graduating an athlete whose pool 
prowess, leadenhip and attitude will 
long be remembered. Carrie Parker, 
whom the Triton media guide calls 
the "top swimmer in UCSD history," 
leaves some enormous shoes to fill. 

While she captured only one na-
tional title- this year's 800 free relay 
- Parker competed in the maximum 
of seven evenlS at the NCAA champi-
onships in each of her four years. She 
was a finalist in all 28 of those events, 
earning All-American honors 25 
times. Parker is the only woman in 
UCSD history to accomplish thi s feat. 
(There wi II be a feature story on Parker 
in the final Guardian issue.)

women' 5 squad which scaIcd the na-
tional ranks to fmish in second place 
behind Kenyon. However, nexl fall's 
freshman class may provide the foun-
dation for a UCSD team capable of 
challenging Kenyon. 80th squads will 
benefit from the new blood, as the 
Tritons will be adding nine athletes to 
both the men 's and women's tearns. 

"We had our best recruiting year 
ever," Boyd said. with a smi le. ''The 
one drawback to the recruiting is that 
we' regoing to bealrnost overcrowded, 
butlhat's a good problem to have." 

The 18 incoming freshman will 
bring with them high expectations; 
but the hardworking and outgoing 
seniors are the ones who have set the 
stage for what looks to be a bright 

future for Triton swimming. Among 
the II graduating seniors is Sheri 
Takeuchi, a di ver who was one of the 
most successful in Division ill his-
tory. She put quite an exclamation 
point at the end of her career by win-
ning both the one- and three-meter 
events at this year's national champi-
onships. She, like Burgasser, was 
named 1996 Diver of the Year. 

Also departing from the women's 
squad are Laurie Boyd, an eight-lime 
All-American, and Shelly Tabke. On 
the men's side, Kaley Parkinson. Andy 
Hollywood and Mike Jefferson will 
also be leaving. The trio captured 15, 
12 and II All-American honors, re-
specti vely: Parkinson and Hollywood 
were also counted on as captains. 

MIKE JEFFERSON: 
Eleven-time AII-

three years on the 
team. Finished 
12th in the 200

Indy Blues ... 
The Indianapolis soo-

nothini Ibout IUtomoIive racina 
comes dole 10 ill widespread 
rccopiIica IIDOII8 f_ and 
Jaymeinlike. Yet this year, the 

... lIUluai pilpifDI8C of top I'ICa'S 
10 Indy his been IIIIInICI by an 
ugly fi8ht between IndyCar 
promocas. The result: There 
were two SOO-Iap Indy c... races 
this weekend. Four months .,0, 
Roger Fenske of Championship 
Auco Rlcing Teams (CARl) 
worked out a compromise for 
this year's Indy SOO with the 
IndyCar Racing League (IRL). 

The total field would 
expand. to 42 cars, with going 
to each organization. The IRL 
and CART would then be 
slated to discuss future Indy 
SOO races at the end of the 
Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) 
Cup season. 

But the larger CART board 
refused to discuss the compro-
mise. With both sides unwilling 
to yield, the talks degenerated 
into an uncomfortable stalemate. 
Like pouting children, the two 
have distaQCed themselves from 
one another ever since. 

The feuding has resulted in 
several changes being made 
within the two divisions, as the 
IRL has already enacted engine 
and chassis rules for 1997 that 

.rare considerably different from 
those of CART. 

n. ........ oI. 
Ultimately, the cost of this 

flexing on the part of CART and 
IRL. was the formation of the 
U.S. SOO, which ran on the 
Michigan International Speed-
way. With the (pPG) Cup at 
stake, drivers with positions to 
defend qluld not afford to race 
in Indianapolis, which then was 
essentially relegated to an 
exhibition race. With the top 
drivers jumping ship to the U.S. 

\ 500, the Indy 500 was opened up 
to relative amateurs. 

The colossal egos of race 
pFOmoters played a multi-million 
dollar game of "chicken" in the 
ratings game. Race fans were 
forced to decide between 
watching Indy, which was raced 
by unknown drivers, or to catch 

. &heir favorite drivers on the 
heretofore unknown U.S. SOO. 
While the Indy 500 won the 
ratings game, the biggest losers 
were the fans. 

In a stroke of poetic justice, 
the predicted pileups and 
accidents of "amateurs" al the 
Indy SOO instead materialized as 
a 12-car mishap on the "profes-
sional" U.S. 500. Jimmy Vassar 
and Adrian Fernandez triggered 
this full-course stop, forcing a

he seven graduating seniors on the men's swimming team could 
not pass for Darryl Hannah, but each does have something in common 
with the Hollywood starlet. (Do-you feel the cliche coming?) Yes, that's 
right, the Tritons made a sizable splash at this year's NCAA Division ill 
NationaJ Championships by finishing fifth, eight places higher than they 
did in 1995. 

Senior diver Adam Burgasser may take exception to the anaJogy, 
however. After aJl, it was his mission in life to splash as little as possible 

following his twists, turns, contortions and cartwheels. Burgasser's success at 
this task allowed him to finish biI D career as an eight-time All-American,. 
He capped his career with the Tri :y winning a national chainpionship 
the three-meter board and by beilll ~ 1he-1996 NCAA Diver of the Year.
