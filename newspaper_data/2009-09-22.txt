The UC Board of Regents met in San Francisco last week to discuss its options in the face of the dire budget crisis currently facing the university. The board is attempting to  close a fund-
ing gap of hundreds of millions of dollars.

UC Vice President Patrick Lenz presented a plan to the regents 
last Wednesday that included a mid year fee increase starting in Jan. 
2010 of 7.5 percent, and a fee increase starting Fall Quarter 2010 of 
15 percent. He blamed the fee increases on rising operation costs and 
dramatically reduced state funding.

According to the presentation, the additional student fees would 
bring in $262.2 million in net revenue that would allow the university 
to eliminate fewer jobs, cut fewer classes and curtail fewer campus 
services.

“To students: I’m sorry, I regret it, but the state has stopped build-
ing the highways to higher education — they’ve started building toll 
roads,” UC President Mark Yudof said.

‘Toll Roads to Education’

By Sarah Alaoui
Staff Writer

Two days after a tragic pole-
vaulting accident left him uncon-
scious, Revelle College sophomore 

Leon Roach was 
declared brain-
dead on Sept. 
5 and taken 
off life sup-
port at Scripps 
Memorial 
Hospital. 

Nineteen-
year-old Roach 
had driven 
down to San 

Diego from Huntington Beach that 
day to practice with the UCSD pole 
vaulting team. 

Under a coach’s supervision, Roach 
was practicing a drill in which he hung 
upside down from a rope slung from a 
tree. He overshot the padded landing 
mat and slammed his head against the 
concrete. 

“The rope drill is something that’s 
a great practice,” said Roach’s brother, 
Curtis Hendrick. “I’ve been doing it 
for 10 years. It helps with your form.”

He was immedietely rushed to the 
hospital, but doctors were unable to 
revive the unconscious athlete.

“Leon died doing what he loved 
to do most,” his mother, Mary Ann 
Roach, said. “I take great comfort in 
the fact that he was where he wanted 
to be.”

When it came to choosing 
between UCSD and UC Berkeley, 
Roach’s passion for pole vaulting took 
precedence — there was no room for 
him on the team at Berkeley, so he 
turned the school down for UCSD 
and a spot on the university’s track 
team.

“When we went to visit Coach 
Darcy and Tony [at UCSD], they 
made him feel like a track star,” Mary 
Ann Roach said. “They were so happy 
to have him; he really felt like the 
team was a family.”

A Huntington Beach native, Roach 
was planning to major in biochemis-
try. He recently took a 13-day motor-
cycling trip to Mexico and Canada 
with his father and brother, Curtis 
Hendrick. 

“I was always proud of him and

Over 1,000 faculty members 
have signed an online petition in 
support of a systemwide walkout 
on Thursday, Sept, 24 at 12 p.m. 
to protest the effects of the UC 
budget cuts.

Sixty of the signatures come 
from UCSD. 

The campus walkout will 
begin at the entrance to Gilman 
Parking Structure.

A coinciding strike held by 
the University Professional and 
Technical Employees, a union 
that represents over 11,000 UC 
workers, will take place on the 
same day.

Carolan Buckmaster, UCSD 
Research Associate and San 
Diego Chapter President of 
UPTE-CWA, explained that the 
two events were planned for the 
same day in order to achieve 
maximum disruption on the first 
day of classes at most UC cam-

Amid increased class sizes, cuts to student 
services and employee layoffs, university 
heads look to hike student fees twice this year.

The UC Union Coalition took 
a vote of no confidence in UC  
President Mark G. Yudof earlier this 
month, a gesture of their dissatis-
faction with the employee furlough 
plan and budget cuts ordered by the 
university in recent months.

The Coalition, which represents 

roughly 70,000 UC employees, too 
a vote between Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. 
According to UCSD employee and 
union leader Carolan Buckmaster, 
9,600 faculty and staff members — 
of the 10,000 who participated in 
the vote — said they had “no confi-
dence” in Yudof. 

“[The vote] shows the univer-
sity and President Yudof that [the 
voters] don’t approve of the direc-

tion that he’s taking the university,” 
Buckmaster said. “We hope that he 
will think about his responsibility, 
and hopefully he will make some 
changes.”

The declaration is partly in 
response to a mandatory employee 
furlough plan the UC Regents insti-
tuted this July in an attempt deal with

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

puses.
“The faculty decided themselves 

what would be best for them as indi-
viduals,” Buckmaster said. “Some 
of them will go to the picket lines, 
some will bring their classes to the 
picket lines and some will do teach-
ins. We see this as step one.” 

On July 29, the Academic 
Council voted unanimously to take 
at least six of their mandatory fur-
lough days this academic year on 
days of instruction.

However, President Yudof and 
the Chancellors rejected the plan, 
announcing that faculty would 
have to take their days off on non 
teaching days usually dedicated to 
research, committee activities and 
other academic obligations. 

“Nobody has said sanything 
about reducing committee and 
other service obligations,” UCLA 
Professor Stephen Bainbridge said in 
his blog, www.professorbainbridge.
com. “Likewise, nobody has said 
anything about reduced research 
expectations. So where exactly is my 
furlough time off?”

Subsequently, an open letter to 

UC faculty began circulating on Aug. 
31, calling on faculty to suspend 
teaching on Sept. 24 unless three 
demands are met: no 
furloughs or paycuts on 
salaries below $40,000, 
immediate institution 
of the Academic Senate 
Council’s July 29 recom-
mendation regarding the 
implementation of fur-
loughs and full disclo-
sure of the UC budget.

The University of 
California Student 
Association, which 
represents all students 
within the UC system, 
unanimously passed a 
resolution in support of 
the systemwide walkout 
shortly after the petition 
began circulating.

The American 
Association of University 
Professors has also endorsed the 
walkout.

 “We recognize that the cur-
rent budget crisis in the state of 
California impacts people across the 
state, and that we must do our part 

to deal with the budget, but we also 
hope to broadcast the fact that ‘busi-
ness as usual’ cannot continue in a 

state of crisis,” Michael 
Davidson, UCSD litera-
ture professor and vice 
chair of the literature 
department, said in a 
statement.

Davidson empha-
sized that walkout orga-
nizers are not merely 
concerned with faculty 
pay issues, but that they 
aim to preserve the qual-
ity and accessibility of 
education within the UC 
system. 

“I signed the walkout 
petition because I believe 
those of us who study, 
work and teach at UC 
San Diego must begin 
to educate each other 
and the public about the 

very real possibility that the UC 
system is increasingly becoming a 
private enclave accessible only to 
the wealthy,” Spanish and Chicano 
literature professor Jorge Mariscal 
said. “We do not believe students 

and their families should carry the 
burden for financing the university, 
or that students should have to go 
into debt for a public education.”

According to Buckmaster, the 
University of California released 
a letter to the faculty indicating 
that the univeresity has emergency 
funds available to replace professors 
if they are not in class. 

UCSD communications pro-
fessor Brian Goldfarb said that 
although he plans to teach class on 
Thursday, he will support students 
if they choose to participate in the 
walkout.

“The labor unions have got the 
ball rolling and we can’t stop it, but 
my hope is that professors will go to 
our classes anyways and educate the 
students on what’s going on with 
the state institution,” he said. “I’ll 
be at my class on Thursday teach-
ing, but I’ll also be giving students 
the opportunity without penalty, to 
walk to the picket lines and join and 
express their discontent with state 
legislators.”

severe reductions in state funding.
The yearlong program, which 

began Sept. 1, requires over 100,000 
UC employees to take 11-26 manda-
tory unpaid days over the next year. 

The furlough plan establishes 
seven different salary groups of 
employees. The employees who earn 
the least  — $40,000 or less — will 
be subject to a 4-percent reduction, 
while those who earn over $240,000 
can expect to see up to a 10 percent 
reduction in pay. 

Buckmaster listed pay cuts, 
executive pay raises and lack of 
union participation in the decision-
making process as major sources of 
faculty discontentment. 

University spokesman Peter 

King said there is no way to tell if 
10,000 people actually participated 

in the vote, because he claims there 
is no documentation. 

“Even if it was 10,000, there are 
70,000 union members, so that’s one 

in seven — and we have 180,000 
employees,” King said. “So you’re 
talking about a very small fraction of 
the people who participated, in essen-
tially what is a public relations antic.”

King said mediocrity must be 
avoided at all costs.  He fears if 
tuiton is not raised, the univer-
sity will not have enough revenue to 
sustain its best professors and UC 
degrees will lose their value. 

“The state is obviously having 
a financial crisis and we’re willing 
to do our part, but it’s a painful 
thing,” he said. “The first choice was 
a balanced budget, but Sacramento 
whacked it.”

More regents expressed sup-
port for the proposal than they had 
during fee-hike proposals in previ-
ous years, explaining at the meet-
ing that they felt the board had 
no other option now that it had 
already resorted to increasing class 
sizes, laying off university staff and 
employees and implementing fur-
loughs.

Protestors at the meeting pointed 
out that students would be paying 
more for larger classes and reduced 
services. They also argued that the 
hikes would undermine the uni-
versity’s commitment to access and 
affordability.

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West gave public 
input at the meeting. 

“[The proposal] came as a shock,” 
she said. “They’re cutting student 
services, [and] with budget cuts and 
the furlough plan, students are pay-
ing more and getting back less from 
the university.”

Following a public comment 
period during which students and 
faculty stood up to speak out against 
the furloughs and fee hikes, a group 
of about 100 protestors broke up 
the meeting with chants criticizing 
Yudof. Fourteen demonstrators were 
arrested. The meeting resumed 20 
minutes later.

The mid year increase would 
raise student fees by $585 for resi-
dent undergraduates and $633 
for nonresidents. The 2010-11 fee 

increase would increase tuition by 
$1,344 for resident undergraduates 
and $1,458 for out-of-state under-
graduates.

Resident and nonresident gradu-
ate students would also see their fees 
increase next semester, by $654 and 
$681, respectively.

The regents approved a similar 
proposal in May, which increased 
student fees by 9.3 percent begin-
ning this quarter.

If the new increases are passed, 
it will mark the eighth time in eight 
years that the regents have voted to 
raise student fees.

The proposal also includes a 
“return to aid” component, in which 
33 percent of the revenue generated 
from the new fee increases would be 
funneled back into financial aid in 
order to lessen the impact of fee hikes 
on financially needy undergraduates.

According to the proposal, how-
ever, the return-to-aid money alone 
would not be enough to fully cover 
the fee increases for low-income 
students — generally those with 
household incomes below $60,000 
to $70,000. The university would 
rely on an increase in Cal Grants to 
cover the remainder.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
June state budget proposal includ-
ed plans to cut all new Cal Grant 
awards and halt future increases 
for grant renewals, preventing max-
imum awards from increasing to 
compensate for future UC fee hikes.

“With the unpredictability of 
what happened to the Cal Grants, 
not knowing if there’s enough aid 
really factors into if students can 
afford to go to school,” West said. 
“[The university] should find alter-
native solutions instead of turning 
their backs on faculty and students, 
because it’s definitely not sustain-
able.”

In addition to the fee hikes, the 
regents also discussed a proposal to 
additionally raise fees for business 
and engineering students, due to the 
higher costs associated with educat-
ing students in those departments. 
They also reviewed a proposal to 
further reduce freshman enrollment 
by 2,300 students.

The regents will vote on the pro-
posals in November.

Props to the House of Representatives for passing a bill that would 
overhaul federal ﬁnancial aid and allot $40 billion to Pell grants.

Flops to Housing, Dining and Hospitality’s Black Book for cheaply 
imitating the UCSD Guardian’s annual Student Survival Guide.

<*�)<+.,;�*90:0: Do Your 
White Cup 
Right: Fro-Yo 
for Dummies
T he frozen-yogurt epidemic has swept San Diego. It has boldly invaded La 
Jolla mini-malls and Price Center 
East alleyways, turning mangos red, 
all berries pink and fruits to ‘froots.’ 
We’re no longer in Yogurt World — 
rather, we’ve been flung into a creamy 

universe of Berries and Beans, Yum 
Yum Yos and Yogart Fusion. 

But amid this delicious, 
unrelenting flurry of cutesy gibberish 
and exotic toppings, many are still 
clueless when it comes to maximizing 
the potential of the white cup. Not 
to worry — the Guru is here with an 
inside guide to ordering frozen yogurt.

First, evaluate your obstacles: 
customers who lack any coherent 
plan of attack. These dazed wanderers 
are infamous for dawdling in front 
of yogurt levers, overwhelmed by 
the prospect of picking from the 
vast selection of flavors before them. 
Step deftly around these uneducated 
vagrants and continue on your way. 

Grab yourself a sample cup and 
approach the yogurt pumps with 
confidence. Maintain concentration 
as you move swiftly between each 
unoccupied station, taking time to 
sample each flavor. Avoid the glare of 
suspicious employees. Do not, I repeat, 
do not make eye contact. These are not 
people, but mere roadblocks on your 
path to yogurt glory. 

Next, you must choose your flavor. 
Resist the urge to crank out a sloppy 
seven-layer concoction — these 
hastily arranged disasters almost 
always trigger a barfy flavor overload. 
As a general rule, plain tart is 
complimentary to almost everything 
(i.e. mango tart and plain tart), fruits 
go well together (i.e. strawberry and 
banana) but nuts do not (coconut 
should never touch peanut butter). 
More unorthodox flavors such as 
green tea and taro usually taste better 
alone, as they tend to be incompatible 
with the majority of toppings. If you’re 
just in it for the Fruity Pebbles, go 
with plain tart and find the real flavor 
at the topping bar. 

Don’t be afraid to slurp some 
yogurt from the top of your cup. 
(Every lick is a subtraction from the 
38 cents per ounce you’ll be paying 
once you place your container on the 
discerning silver scale.) Wrap both 
hands around it so your thumb and 
index are cupping its rim, then thump 
the bottom on the topping counter. 
This will pack the yogurt tighter and 
allow more room for what’s to come.

Now, onto the most challenging 
phase of construction: the toppings. 
They are the jewels to your crown 
achievement and must be handled 
with care. It is no doubt tempting to 
compromise your well-thought-out 
plan for a sudden frosted Circus 
Animals craving. But be strong. 
Remember: You’ve committed to a 
fro-yo flavor and must pay it due 
compliments. If you chose peanut 
butter, you’ll have to stick with basic 
chocolate treats. Sometimes fruit 
flavors taste good with chocolate 
chips, but usually they just need more 
fruit. Chocolate calls for a classic 
combination of strawberries and 
almonds. Plain tart will take whatever 
you give it, but don’t forget to practice 

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — UC President Mark Yudof 
made one thing clear during his public address on Sept. 11: Even 
in the midst of this recession, he’s not willing to compromise 
quality or access to the university, which — to the unknowing 
student — might seem a pretty compelling promise. 

The thing is, we can’t have both. 
Despite President Yudof ’s pride in the fact that we enroll 

twice as many Pell Grant-eligible students as any Ivy League 
school, in order to maintain the same standard of accessibility of 
which President Yudof is so proud, we have to make a choice.

Do we sustain our current level of excellence and hike stu-
dent fees so unreachably high that many cannot benefit from a 

QUICKTAKES

The current health-reform proposal that has 
everybody’s panties in a twist is the “America’s 
Healthy Future Act,” as proposed by Senator 
Max Baucus (D – Montana) and the Senate 
Finance Committee. While the plan is the 
closest proposal to actual bipartisan legisla-
tion, issues with its allocation of funds (and 
proposed sources of revenue) mean that there’s 
something for senators on both sides of the 
aisle to dislike.

Plus, the plan’s relatively low price of $856 
billion (compared to the House’s proposed $1.5 
trillion) has some major drawbacks. Though all 
individuals will be required to have some form 
of coverage, in accordance with Obama’s wish-
es, the bill offers only $458 billion to subsidize 
low-income families, as opposed to the House 
bill’s $773 billion. This allows conservatives 
across the board to paint mandatory health 
care as a costly burden to the average working 
family. Meanwhile, its lack of a public- health 
option frustrates liberals and makes it unlikely 
to be signed into law as is.

While the Baucus plan is a good first step to 
necessary compromise, it also makes the fatal 
error of trying to please everybody, with the 
end result of pleasing nobody.

Federal Health-Care Proposals

Earlier this month, President Obama 
famously declared that he would “not 
sign a plan that adds one dime to our 
deficits” — bad news for the Democrats 
behind America’s Affordable Health 
Choices Act of 2009, also known as HR 
3200. This plan proposes a $1.5 trillion 
overhaul of the health-care system over a 
10-year period and, in the process, would 
add $239 billion to the federal debt.

As one of the earliest proposals on 
the health-care table, HR 3200 adheres 
very closely to Obama’s requirements: It 
penalizes those without insurance and 
offers coverage for preventative proce-
dures like checkups. 

Because it follows the president’s 
guidelines so closely and has such high 
predicted costs, however, Republicans 
stamped this bill as a liberal creation. 
Without the essential bipartisan support 
that would have made it a viable option, 
it has largely faded from the public eye — 
and given the fact that it would expand 
our federal deficit, which other plans 
allegedly will not, it’s not the most desir-
able option, either.

As theoretical proposals go, the Obama-Biden guideline lays solid groundwork for any subsequent reform bills; it contains 
both Democratic and Republican suggestions and 
offers possible funding sources.

This hypothetical bill would improve the cov-
erage of those who already have insurance, and 
also make it available to those who don’t. Ideally, 
it also must keep future costs to a minimum while 
decreasing the current costs of health care.

Two of the most prominent proposals are those 
of the Senate Financial Committee and the House 
Tri-Committee — a less palatable option thanks 
to its deficit-widening price.

Dear Editor,
Women around the world and in 

our local region need preservation of 
their rights as human beings instead of 
baby-making machines. It is our envi-
ronmental responsibility to provide 
means for a better life to many women 
and girls struggling in developing 
countries as well as in developed coun-
tries that enforce unjust laws based on 
religious or cultural beliefs. 

Our environmental crisis is a 
direct result of our growing popula-
tion’s carelessness. Every day 200,000 
more people are born and increase our 
population’s burden on the planet by 
polluting and depleting resources. 

Women around the world are 
raised to believe they have no other 
options than to give birth to more 
children than they often want, add-
ing to rising poverty levels and an 
unhealthy population. 

The solutions to this problem are: 
restricting family size, making abor-
tion and contraception available and 
legal, encouraging alternative lifestyles 
and, of course, allowing universal 
access to education.

We can learn from struggling areas 
like Africa that availability of family 
planning can significantly improve life. 

Knowing that over 5,000 women 
die in childbirth each year and that 
two-thirds of the illiterate world 
population are women, we must feel 
very fortunate to live in a country 
with accessible medicine, doctors and 
education. 

But the truth remains anywhere 
that to be a responsible species liv-
ing on Earth, it is our obligation to 
defeat outdated beliefs which prevent 
the logical needs of our exponentially 
destructive population.

San Diego resident

Dear Editor,
There’s a lot of talk about the 

opposition to Obama’s health-care 
plan. Some call it communist, assail-
ing it as an elimination of human 
freedom. But honestly, where’s the 
problem? 

Insurance companies have ethics 
panels that determine if end-of-
life procedures are worth the cost. 
Republicans don’t call those “death 
panels.” 

Insurance companies also limit 
which expensive medicines are 
available to their customers, but 
Republicans don’t call that “health-
care rationing.” 

Obama talks of limiting reim-
bursements in order to cut costs, 
and opponents call such measures 
a travesty. However, it’s well under-
stood that insurance companies 
cut costs by shedding patients who 
make claims. When they do this, we 
are to believe it is justified for some 
reason. Honestly, only Obama’s 
plans get the inflammatory labels.

 These folks are not angry about 
health care. They are not upset that 
the next time they apply for health 
insurance, a government program 
will appear in the list of options.

restraint. Just because you have a 
blank canvas doesn’t mean you can go 
Jackson Pollock all over it.

If toppings are self-serve, dump 
on a little more than your budget 
allows and pick at them while waiting 
in line. It’s not every day you can 
pop a peeled lychee into your mouth 
without paying for it.

When you’ve finally reached 
the moment in which you and your 
yogurt creation will be legally united, 
refrain from looking too stoked. 
Mumble something about how it’s a 
crime to pay $7.50 for a cup of yogurt. 
Simple guilt games will slowly but 
surely break down each employee’s 
future enforcement of sampling rules, 
and who knows — next time they 

catch you swiping a cheesecake cube, 
they might just let it slide. 

Time to enjoy your hard work. 
You have roughly 15 minutes before 
it becomes a murky pool of helpless 
gummy creatures drowning in a 
sticky mess of better times. Do not 
wait for your friend, still torn between 
pineapple chunks and Oreo crumbs. 
Leave him. He’s weak.

Sometimes we Christians do come across in an 
arrogant, self-righteous way that smacks of intolerance.  

I heard about a preacher on campus who was very hostile 
and insulting of university students.  In my opinion, he 

was a poor representative of Jesus Christ. However, most 
Christians are not that way.  Christians are basically tolerant of people 
from other religions and persuasions.  In a pluralistic society, it is 
necessary for all of us to get along, to respect the personhood and 
rights of one another.  We are an ideologically and religiously diverse 
people, and unless we learn to live in mutual care and respect, our 
society won’t be able to survive as a free democracy.

Having said these things, I want to speak to a related issue.  In a 
pluralistic society, and particularly in a university campus setting like 
UCSD where comparative religions and anthropology courses abound, 
it is hard not to be influenced by religious and moral relativism.  A 
climate of relativism causes many students and faculty to interpret any 
strong religious belief, including Christian belief, as intolerance, often 
resulting in misunderstanding, disrespect, and sometimes ridicule 
toward those who hold these views.

The assumption is that one cannot believe in any absolute truth or 
moral values without being intolerant. But that’s really not the case.  
Actually every major religion has some non-negotiable “truths” that 
contradict the beliefs of other religions.  And all the founders of the 
world’s major religions had teachings that were different from one 
another, and in many cases, were mutually exclusive of one another.  
For example, the nature of God, the nature of humankind, the need 
for salvation of some kind, the means of salvation, and the concept of 
afterlife are essential teachings of all major religions, and most 
religions hold mutually exclusive points of view on these things.

Is it being intolerant to believe in something or Someone that others 
don’t believe in?  It seems to me that that’s not intolerant, unless the 
believers feel a need to force everyone else to believe what they 
believe, or unless they belittle those who disagree with them.  
Actually, I believe it is much more intolerant to treat people of religious 
conviction as if their convictions are of no value. Or, just as bad, as if 
they are equally valid with everyone else’s religious belief.  The only 
way that can be true when dealing with mutually exclusive truth claims 
is if all religious beliefs are equally invalid.  That viewpoint shows 
disrespect for the convictions of all religious believers, and relegates 
them to the area of fantasy or fiction, as if hey have no relevance in 
the REAL and objective world.

Tolerance is a two-edged sword that cuts both directions.  We 
Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  
We believe Jesus loves every person and people group, that He died 
for our sins, that He rose from death and now, as risen and living 
Savior of the world, offers to every human being a personal love 
relationship and the gift of eternal life.  Further, we believe that every 
person on this planet deserves the opportunity to hear about Christ’s 
love and to respond to His invitation to eternal life.  We hold these 
beliefs with the utmost love and respect for all human beings, 
including those of other religions or those who have no religion at all.  
We ask that you seek to be tolerant of us, as we seek to be of you.  
May God bless you in every way.

After all, do these people protest that their 
children can apply for government school 
grants as well as private grants? Are they 
appalled that if they apply for a business loan, 
they’ll see a mixture of government loan 
options and private foundations? 

No, the problem they have is with Obama 
himself, with the color of his skin. Everything 
in their cultural makeup tells them that they 
will not allow themselves to be ruled by a 
black man. These people are still back in 
1963, blocking school entrances. They’ve 
never given up, and even though the Obama 
election handed them the ultimate insult to 
their belief in white superiority, don’t expect 
them to give up now. Gun-shop owners will 
tell you that the reason why gun ownership 
has skyrocketed is the existence of a President 
Obama.  So what do we do about these vigi-
lantes? Simple. What would we do about them 
if they were of Middle Eastern descent? What 
would we do if their leaders were named 
Mohammad and Jamal, rather than Bud and 
Joe? If that were the case, I’m sure America 
would be responding more forcefully. We 
should do the same with this crowd.

Dear Editor,
Regional water usage in San Diego has 

dropped, but San Diego locals should not stop 
there. The city imports 90 percent of its water 
form outside sources such as the Colorado 
River and the Sierra Nevada Runoff. The city’s 
reliance on outside sources for water is a major 
reason why individuals should become aware 
of the San Diego water crisis and be publicly 
informed on simple methods through which 
they could cut down on their water usage. 

Simple methods households could use to 
help conserve water include repairing faucet 
leaks or replacing washers with more efficient 
ones. People should avoid flushing their toi-
lets when it is unnecessary, such as flushing 
insects or other trash down the drain. When 
brushing your teeth or washing your face, you 
should never keep the water running. Water 
usage is usually estimated to increase during 
the summer months, but simple methods, 
such as taking shorter showers, could help 
reduce this.

UC education? Or do we accept the fact that, for 
now, we can’t afford to keep the expensive pro-
fessors and research that gave the university its 
esteemed reputation?

It’s a tough question to answer, but we must 
remember that the goal of a public university is 
to provide affordable higher education to any-
one who wants it. 

It isn’t ideal, to be sure, but the lesser of 
two hard-hitting evils in this situation is to 
cut spending on services and faculty. We bet-
ter hope, probably in vain, that those pricey 
professors will stick around San Diego and 
Berkeley for the California sunshine even if 
they could make more at Johns Hopkins or 
Columbia University, because raising student 
fees 44 percent in two years — as Yudof has 
proposed — will compromise access. 

After the $662 increase the regents insti-
tuted for the current academic year, students 
now pay $7,788 per year. By the 2010-11 aca-
demic year, they’ll be paying $10,302. That’s a 
32 percent increase — and with the recession 
at work, you can safely bet that most don’t have 
32 percent deeper pockets.

 Yudof stated that a third of fee increases for 
undergraduates would be used on financial aid, 
as will half of the graduate student fee increases 
(their fee hikes will sting even more: up by as 
much as $654 for Winter Quarter 2010 and 
$1,506 for next fall, depending on the pro-
gram). Even so, that’s a bit like punching some-
one in the eye and then offering him gauze and 
body tape — okay, maybe some Neosporin, 
too. It’s just a vicious circle. 

Rather than commanding funds from 
students only to give it back to those with 
aid packages, Yudof ought to be assessing 
other forms of damage control: Though a fee 
increase may be unavoidable, trimming the fat 
through further service cuts as well as layoffs 
could make the blow a little less painful. At 
a public university with a total enrollment of 
over 190,000, the interests of the many have 
to be taken into account — and chief among 
those interests is giving everyone a chance to 
enroll.

Lower on most students’ lists are non-
essential offerings and services like psychologi-
cal counseling, concerts and events and on-
campus clubs. Because — as rewarding and as 
valuable as those non-necessities can be — in a 
crisis of this magnitude, the focus needs to be 
on preserving what every university must pro-
vide: a simple classroom education. 

Yudof was quick to remind us that the 
poorest UC students won’t be impacted by 
the increase. Under the university’s Blue and 
Gold Opportunity Plan, implemented this 
academic year, those families with incomes 
below $60,000 per year currently don’t pay any 
educational or registration fees, and under his 
proposal that program would extend through 
next year. 

Students with family incomes from 
$115,000 to $180,000 are covered, too — 
President Obama instituted a tax break for 
those in that income range that will offset the 
increases. 

Though it’s certainly nice that Yudof isn’t 
proposing we trade the poorest students for 
fancy lab equipment, and we can presume 
that students falling in the $150,000 range and 
above will still be free to park their BMWs 
in Pangea Parking Structure come next year, 
Yudof ’s proposal creates a huge middle-class 
problem: The average student falls into neither 
category. In Fall Quarter 2008, the average par-
ent income of freshmen across all campuses 
was $90,472. UCSD freshmen, however, report-
ed an average family income of $82,114.

Yudof reminded us that those who will be 
most adversely impacted, should his proposal 
come to fruition, are not the “genuinely poor.” 
But for the student whose family narrowly 
misses that $60,000 cap, the extra $3,000 per 
year can go a long way — and can be the 
deciding difference in being able to afford 
health insurance, or any number of other basic 
living expenses that many will not be able to 
afford as easily, even if they aren’t “genuinely 
poor.” 

Assuming room and board fees stay exactly 
the same for the next year (probably not the 
safest bet), the cost of attending UCSD would 
balloon to over $28,000 for 2010-11, which 
would amount to a staggering 34 percent of 
that average family’s annual income. 

Granted, even before these increases, many 
families still forked a hefty portion of their 
wages over to the university. But in a time 
when nearly everyone has less, Yudof ’s insis-
tence on charging students 44 percent more in 
two years is an especially harsh slap in the face. 
Softening the blow with further service cuts 
and layoffs might not be ideal, but until that 
$535 million deficit-eliminating donation pulls 
through (we’re looking at you, Mr. Gates), no 
choice of action will please everyone.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2009� OPINION



HOME
ON

N ot long after UCSD officials studded palms around the freshly finished Rady School of Management in 2007, they 
turned their gaze, naturally, to the park-
ing lot across the street. (High-rise 
expansion has always been a top priority 
for the university; parking lots, not so 
much.)

So, with $113 million collected from 
student-fee revenue, Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality (HDH) decided to give 
a new face to transfer housing, with the 
goal of expanding the on-campus popu-
lation in size and diversity.

After three years of construction, the 
first phase of UCSD’s first-ever transfer-
student housing complex — the Village 
at Torrey Pines — 
opened its doors to a 
new class of transfers 
on Aug. 26, 2009. 
Although it largely 
resembles the snazzy 
dorms and apartments 
in neighboring Eleanor 
Roosevelt College built 
in 2003, the Village 
comes with slightly 
better benefits: It will 
provide its nearly 
1,060 residents with 
a two-year housing 
guarantee, and is the 
first facility on campus 
to offer a 12-month 
contract.

Plus, it comes fully furbished with 
appliances and amenities to make stu-
dents feel at home — if home was a slick 
Ikea model.

The concept of on-campus transfer 
housing was first proposed seven years 
ago, but it wasn’t until 2005 that the 
real work began. After Village planners 
reviewed proposals from architects, 
shopped around for the ideal construc-
tion company for the job and hashed 
through a jungle of budgets and higher-
up approvals — a two-year process in all 
— the Village structure finally began to 
rise from the ground.  

Construction was broken down into 
two phases, on two separate sides of the 
street. Phase I — including a 15-story 
tower, seven low-rise complexes, a dining 
hall and a satellite bookstore — was to 

be completed by Fall 2009, and Phase II 
— including a 10-story tower, four low-
rise complexes, a restaurant and cafe/
grocery store — was to be completed by 
Fall 2010. 

Within months of their start date, 
crews had upturned the asphalt (which 
would later be recycled into the Village’s 
foundation) and installed an under-
ground utility system in preparation 
for the massive housing structures that 
would soon take shape.

The Village now takes the title of 
tallest building on campus. It stands 15 
stories tall, towering over the seven low-
rise companion complexes below. The 
latest HDH project reflects UCSD’s new 
priorities for campus growth: vertical 

construction (in gen-
eral) and home-style 
housing (in particular), 
erected with environ-
mentally sound brag-
ging rights. 

Transfer students 
began moving into their 
apartments and town-
houses last weekend.

The Village’s low-rise 
complexes are spread 
over the site’s peninsular 
terrain, running parallel 
to each other with open 
social courts and lawns 
in between. Lucky for 
low-rise residents, the 
surrounding La Jolla 

community requested UCSD not raise 
an unsightly barrier along North Torrey 
Pines Road (as it had done with ERC), 
so the view from west-facing apartments 
have been left uncompromised. 

Students living in the tower have 
an even better panorama from their 
windows — one that overlooks the com-
plexes below, the verdant Torrey Pines 
Golf Course to northeast and the Pacific 
Ocean stretching out from the glider 
port.

But calming ocean views come at a 
price. The Village charges roughly $30 
more a month for those apartments with 
the best visibility.

“Those guys up there, in Building 
One, they have a really nice view,” said 
Thurgood Marshall transfer student Josh 
You. “Some of them were talking about 

watching the LPGA [golf tournament] 
from their balconies.” 

Along with roommates Dan Triplett 
and Viet Nguyen, You attended commu-
nity college before moving to UCSD. 

“I kind of always wanted to get that 
on-campus living experience,” said 
Triplett. “My brother went to a school 
where he moved in as a freshman, and 
most community-college students don’t 
really get that.”

All three of the transfer students live 
in a low-rise apartment complex right 
across from the tower. Their living space 
comes fully furnished and includes a 
refrigerator, oven and microwave; in 
addition, students arrive to welcome 
packets containing cookies, candy, fliers 
and T-shirts.

Nguyen’s only complaint: “The couch 
is a little hard.”

According to HDH, Village accom-
modations are designed to feel more 
open, contemporary and communitarian.

“I walked through campus and saw 
that the other colleges’ living situations 
didn’t look as nice; they all looked like 
jails,” said You.

Although they’ve only been living 
on campus since Saturday, You and his 
roommates have already noticed the 
social perks of on-campus transfer hous-
ing.

“You can really tell that people in the 
Village really want to meet other people,” 
said You. “You’ve got people knocking on 
your door just to say, ‘Hey, what’s up?’”

You, Triplett and Nguyen pay around 
$1,300 a month each for their apart-
ment, which covers utilities, cable and an 
annual $2,100 meal-point plan.

The selection process for this year’s 
transfer-student population was done 
lottery style; next year’s hopefuls, how-
ever, will have to fill out applications 
similar to those used by the neighboring 
International House, and will be accepted 
based on merit.

Because transfer students belong to all 
six of UCSD’s colleges and therefore don’t 
all share the same general-education 
requirements, HDH decided to group 
students within the complex by their 
respective colleges.

Eventually, the Village will add more 

Above: A portion of the rooms in the Village 
were furnished by students from the San 
Diego Institute of Design. They were given 
a $1,500 budget by Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality and asked to create apartments 
designed to fit students’ needs.

libations and music.

THE  BOTTOM LINEA t first glance, San Diego’s trio of catch-phrasey Thursday art parties seem one and the same. All are held at prominent museums, feature interac-
tive art-making activities, take place on the same night 
of the week and use art as an excuse to party.

The differences are subtle — and, after a couple of 
acai berry vodka-somethings, nearly imperceptible, as 
you’ll encounter many of the same personas at each 
event. These affairs rarely, if ever, land on the same 
night, and have diminished in frequency since the eco-
nomic crash, so you’re also likely see many of the same 
faces.

Avoid the business-casual creeper trying to impress 
you with his entry-level salary and stained khakis. 
Vogue for the DiscoverSD.com photogs. Smile and wave 
awkwardly at your TA from across the gallery. Sneer at 
the girls dressed like they’re headed for Stingaree — the 
one who obviously didn’t come for the art. Unless, of 
course, that’s you — and in that case, sneer at the art 
snobs who don’t believe that art can be for everyone.

Because ultimately, that’s the goal of these new cen-
tury traditions: to prove that art is enjoyable and acces-
sible. 

If you’re an aspiring young professional or just 
looking to snatch up a cougar/manther, Culture and 
Cocktails at the San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa 
Park just might be your hunting ground.

For the $15 cover, you’ll get a drink ticket and access 
to the museum’s current acclaimed exhibitions. The 
most recent installment spotlighted the black-and-white 
portraits of famed photographer Richard Avedon — but 
Rivera, Picasso and Calder were just around the corner.

Stop by the gift shop on your way out, where you’ll 
find a collection of art reads, earthy jewelry, museum 
paraphernalia and even a phallic children’s toy or two.

The next iteration of Culture and Cocktails takes 
place on Oct. 29 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. (shell out an 
additional $10 for the guided pre-tour at 5:30 p.m. 
and get a second drink ticket), and features “American 
Artists from the Russian Empire.”
     If you wish you went to FIDM instead of UCSD or 
like live music with your Oppenheim installations, 
Thursday Night Thing at the downtown San Diego 
site of the Museum of Contemporary Art is your ideal 

destination.
A $10 “donation” will get you in the door, 

a spot in the crowd for a performance by 
some 91.1 FM–sponsored band and an 
introduction to the provocative world of 
post-1950s art. Past events have included 
poetry jams and fashion shows, and Stone 
Brewery usually makes an appearance 
with its local, craft-brewed beer.
     If you’re a cult-film buff or get a thrill 
out of dressing up for theme parties, 
you’ll fit in seamlessly at the Museum 
of Photographic Arts’ Pop Thursdays 
series.

A $6 entrance fee will do you 
the least financial damage of the 
three. Arrive early, because seating 
for the movie is first come, first 
served. “Barbarella,” “Dirty Harry” 
and “Animal House” are former 
features. Stay after to mingle (or 
prowl) in the gal-
leries, and maybe 
even try your 
hand at draw-
ing. Dr. Sketchy’s 
Anti-Art School 
has been known 
to bring a bur-
lesque dancer or 
fetish model for 
DIY inspiration. 
And don’t forget 
to cram into one 
of the antique 
photo booths for 
some serious hamming and a new Facebook profile 
picture.

 Thursday Night Thing returns from a summer-long 
hiatus on Nov. 5 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. to showcase the 
Tara Donavon exhibition. You missed “This is Spinal 
Tap” at the last Pop Thursdays event last week, but keep 
checking the MoPA Web site for the next night, which 
will probably be sometime in November.

BEYOND THE BLACKBOARD:
SUMMER RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS

F or the third summer in a row, a group of UCSD graduate students made the transatlantic 
passage to Spain — and not for your 
typical study-abroad sojourn.

Collaborating with volunteers, 
researchers and literature professor 
Luis Martin-Cabrera, 
the students busied 
themselves by collect-
ing interviews from 
survivors of General 
Francisco Franco’s fas-
cist dictatorship.

The researchers are 
part of the Spanish Civil 
War Memory Project, a 
group of students that 
has been collecting in-
person interviews with 
audiovisual recording 
equipment since 2007. 
Their goal is to amass 
a digital archive of interviews, to be 
made available on the Internet.

For nearly 40 years after the Spanish 
Civil War, Franco inaugurated the lon-
gest dictatorship in European history, 
lasting from 1939-75.

Martin-Cabrera initiated the project 
when he decided to work with human-
rights organizations in Spain and the 
Special Collections Library in Geisel 
Library to create an audiovisual archive 
similar to those documenting the 
Holocaust at Yale and the University 
of Southern California. He contacted 

the Association for the Recuperation 
of Historical Memory in Spain, who 
provided the project’s first group with 
survivors to interview. 

A year after their first summer 
abroad, organizers raised enough funds 
to send three groups during the sum-
mer of 2008. Over the past months, 
graduate students traveled through 
Madrid, Barcelona, Granada, Málaga 

and the south of France seeking stories. 
Graduate student Scott Boehm, who 

blogged his travels for the UCSD News 
Center’s “Dispatches from the Field,” 
has been working in Madrid, helping 
other teams in the area conduct nearly 
40 interviews. A majority of the testi-
monies are from former political pris-
oners — one of whom Boehm encoun-
tered one-on-one, when he interviewed 
José Benito Bartres.

nation of each candidate’s campaign indicated that 
challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi had an advantage.

Months before Iran’s incendiary political protests 
broke out, the UCSD professor had been research-
ing the impact of the Internet on Iranian elections. 
Though the country was on the cusp of an especially 
critical presidential election — set to take place on 
June 12, 2009 — Rahimi’s predictions were far less 
dissentious than the election’s actual outcome. 

“Of course, at that time, I had no idea how 
Iranian politics would dramatically change after 
the elections,” Rahimi said. “During my research, 
I learned how a civil society — that is, the space 
between individual and state — can carve out new 
spaces of dissent in face of state repression.”

During the violent turmoil that ensued, he turned 
his attention to the pivotal roles that minority and 
marginal groups, such as women’s organizations, 
were playing in post-election politics.

Rahimi said he also witnessed firsthand how the 
state used the rhetoric of democracy to quell the 
country’s swelling opposition. 

“I would say the social climate in Iran has cer-
tainly gone back to ‘normal’, though there is always 
an element of unrest within the fabric of Iranian 
society,” he said. “At any moment, anything could 
happen or anyone could call out for a rally, paint an 
anti-government graffiti on a public space, where

than 380,000 square feet of new housing, din-
ing and community facilities.

“[The Village] is built on one quarter of the 
acreage ERC was built on,” Director of HDH 
Mark Cunningham said. “This right now, this 
was a little less than the square-foot cost it cost 
to build ERC in 2003.”

Although Phase II of Village construction 
— which will provide an additional 805 beds 
for transfer students —is still underway, the 
completion of Phase I has HDH hoping that 
transfers will be able to enjoy the same, if not 
better, communal on-campus experience that 
other undergraduates have enjoyed for the past 
50 years. 

The Village does appear to reflect ERC’s 
communitarian design. From a pool of 38 
architectural proposals, the university’s build-
ing advisory committee chose a design that 
mimicked ERC’s spacious, modern appeal 
while taking on its own communal character.

During planning stages, HDH staff placed 
phone calls to incoming transfer students and 
asked what they wanted from an on-campus 
housing experience. 

Although the university hopes its efforts 
— toward creating a thriving social hive of 
the transfer-student population — take root, 
it recognizes that the nature of the Village 
is quite different from that of other housing 
communities on campus.

Unlike, say, John Muir College, the 
Village’s students have less to bond over: 
They don’t all take the same general-educa-
tion courses or come into college with the 
same four-year, party-hard plan. This year’s 
on-campus transfer students range in age 
from 16 to 42.

According to Cunningham, the Village’s 
builders actually spent two nights shacking 
up in two of ERC’s apartments before start-
ing construction, to make note of the build-
ings faults — like thin yet over-insulated 
walls — and overcome them in designing the 
Village.

After the two-night experiment in ERC 
housing (which many students under-
stand to be the nicest facilities on campus), 

Cunningham said he was sure he and his 
crew had the potential to build an even more 
impressive complex.

Though the Village recycles many of ERC’s 
basic architectural elements — like flat facades 
and vertical expansion — Cunningham said 
the Village was designed with atmospheric 
elements like wider windows and roomier 
walkways in order to foster a greater sense of 
togetherness. In addition, native-plant land-
scaping will ensure minimum water usage 
within the community.

Once construction began, most of the 
Village’s more expensive plans — like move-
able shutters and a communal 15th floor 
— had to be struck due to a tight budget. 
But soon thereafter, HDH got lucky. Though 
the economic downturn took a brutal toll on 
students and families everywhere, it couldn’t 
have come at a better time for the Village 
(whose funds, of course, had already been 
secured). Actualizing innovative designs and 
purchasing interior amenities became much 
more affordable, construction costs plum-
meted and HDH building planners were able 
to re-implement many of the optimistic ideas 
that had originally characterized their vision 
of the Village.

“The amazing part [is that] this was actu-
ally in the original concept back in 2004 
when we started the project — but we had to 
cut it out,” Cunningham said, walking across 
the tower’s top floor. “As things went on 
though, we obviously were able to put money 
back into the budget because costs kept com-
ing down.”

Along with aesthetic improvements like 
granite countertops instead of laminate and 
metal-plated plumbing fixtures in place of 
stainless steel, many of the Village’s last-minute 
upgrades were environmentally minded. 
On the exterior, steel-frame structures were 
erected instead of wood and high-efficiency 
windows were installed to reflect the heat and 
lessen the need for air conditioning. On the 
interior, low-flush plumbing fixtures, energy-
efficient boilers and energy-efficient lighting

C rossfaded college students can breathe a collective sigh of relief. A study conducted 
by UCSD researchers suggests that 
marijuana use may shield the brain 
from some of the harmful effects of 
binge drinking.

Director of state campaigns for 
the Marijuana Policy Project Steve 
Fox claims the study’s results can be 
used to support the legalization of 
marijuana.

“This study suggests that not 
only is marijuana safer than alcohol, 
it may actually protect against some 
of the damage that booze causes,” 
Fox said in a news release. “It’s far 
better for teens not to drink or 
smoke marijuana, but our nation’s 
leaders send a dangerous message by 
defending laws that encourage the 
use of alcohol over marijuana.”

Dr. Susan Tapert, from UCSD’s 
department of psychiatry, was the 
study’s principal investigator. Tapert 
and her team of researchers con-
ducted brain scans on 42 subjects, 
from 16 to 19 years old, to analyze 
the health of their brain tissue.

Good news for all young adults 
well-versed in the twin arts of 
boozing and bonging: Tapert said 
the results would likely be similar 
in those between the ages of 20 and 
22.

The study compared three 
groups: binge drinkers, binge drink-
ers who were also heavy marijuana 
users and controls. Researchers 
found that, overall, the white matter 
of the alcohol-marijuana group was 
of better quality than the alcohol-
only group. White matter transmits 
information between brain cells 
and, when compromised, can affect 
memory, thinking and learning.

Which you can use as an excuse 
for why your stoned roommate got 

a better grade than you in MMW 
(or why your stoned self got the “A” 
and your hungover friend the “C”).

Other recent research has shown 
that heavy alcohol use in adoles-
cents is injurious to the brain. This 
is bad news to underage drinkers, 
as it was formerly thought that the 
physical harm caused by alcohol 
didn’t manifest until later in adult-
hood. Turns out, the neural damage 
of all that flip cup is readily appar-
ent even before you can use your 
real ID to buy booze.

However, little has been known 
about the effects of combined alco-
hol and marijuana use on young 
developing brains. According to 
Tapert’s study, alcohol and mari-
juana are the two most widely used 
intoxicants in this age group, and 
they often go hand in hand. 

The findings of this study may 
be attributed to the considerable 
presence of cannabinoids — chemi-
cal compounds known to protect 
neural matter from certain types of 
damage — in weed. 

Proponents of marijuana legal-
ization thus point to the study’s 
findings as potential proof of the 
psychoactive plant’s medicinal 
benefits. Cannabis is currently 
categorized as a Schedule I drug, 
alongside the significantly more 
potent heroin and LSD. A criterion 

for this most-restrictive classifica-
tion is that the substance is not 
used as a medicinal treatment in 
the country. However, the United 
States government holds a patent 
on cannabinoids for their antioxi-
dant and neuroprotectant proper-
ties, and medical marijuana is legal 
in 13 states.

Tapert’s study, published in the 
Neurotoxicology and Teratology 
science journal, was funded by 
research grants from the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse and the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism.

The participants were recruited 
from local high schools and col-
leges. They were similar in demo-
graphic, behavior and mood. The 
study defined binge drinking as 
consuming four or more alco-
holic drinks on one occasion (five 
or more for males), while heavy 
marijuana use was considered to 
be 180 to 1800 uses in a lifetime 
— prerequisites that many college 
students have no trouble meeting. 
Participants in the control group 
had little to no history of substance 
use.

In three of the eight areas of 
the brain examined, the alcohol-
marijuana users showed white mat-

it could be seen by thousands of city 
dwellers.”

Although Rahimi conducted most 
of his research in Tehran, he also trav-
eled to the port city of Bushehr and the 
southwestern provinces of Khuzestan 
and Lurestan. His work examines the 
social fabric of the country through 
interviews, observations and analy-
sis. Rahimi, who has discussed his 
experiences on CNN and in pieces for 
the New York Times and Los Angeles 
Times, has been laboring industriously 
to reveal the revolutionary attitude 
Iranian citizens have adopted. 

“I prefer the grassroots style of 
research because it is mainly about the 
lived spaces of here and now,” Rahimi 
said. “As a nation of shifting circum-
stances, Iran is bustling with identities 
and individuals that are constantly 

morphing.”
This year, the professor is planning 

to teach a course on Iranian cinema 
— focusing on the country’s political 
culture within aesthetic mediums of 
communication — and an installment 
of Making of the Modern World. The 
latter will emphasize his specialty: 
Asian-Islamic history. 

Rahimi’s field research may be on 
pause, but he plans to continue work-
ing on a short manuscript planned for 
release in 2011 and hold lectures on 
his experience abroad. 

“The key point is how politics, in 
whatever form, is always about a good 
fight and, usually, there is no clear 
winner or loser in the game of poli-
tics,” he said.

testing when he was 15, and over 
the course of the next 20 years, he 
returned to prison several times. In 
1972 — three years before Franco’s 
death — he was arrested again, and 
forced to serve four years behind 
bars. He participated in two hunger 
strikes before his release. 

“You’re dealing with real people 
who, in many cases, have suffered 
tremendous trauma over the course of 
their lives,” Boehm said. “It is inspir-
ing to see people who continue to 
fight for the ideals that once landed 
them in prison or were the reason that 
so many people were tortured and 
killed under Franco’s dictatorship.”

The summer interviews are con-
ducted with as little interruption 
as possible. By recording survivors’ 

testimonies, students hope to capture 
pauses, repetitions and body language.

Many of the graduate students 
abroad also helped excavate the 
unmarked tombs of political prison-
ers in mass grave exhumations. 

The team has collected nearly 120 
interviews so far this summer, and 
plans to continue its expeditions as 
long as it can find funding. 

“I hope that somebody will see the 
potential and the importance of our 
work and decide to help us, because 
it is very clear that [the project] has 
captured the interest and the passion 
of a good number of both graduate 
and undergraduate students,” said 
Martin-Cabrera.

14 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2009� FOCUS

ter that was in significantly poorer 
health than controls. In the other 
five areas, however, their results were 
not significantly different than those 
of the control group. Alcohol-only 
showed significant damage in all 
eight areas.

Although research on combined 
alcohol and marijuana use is still 
emerging, Tapert has high hopes for 
the study’s findings. As cannabinoids 
found in marijuana are also present 
in the nervous and immune systems, 
she suggests that the potential use of 
marijuana to protect the brain from 
other damage may be reproduced 
with the cannabinoids that occur 
naturally in the human body.

However, Tapert is wary of 
potential false conclusions.

“I think the key finding has been 
lost in some of the hubbub: that is 
that young people who did not use 
alcohol or marijuana had the best 
quality of white matter in the brain,” 
she said in an e-mail. “There are 
many other risks that make me hope 
young people think very carefully 
about cannabis use it diminishes 
judgment, reaction time and driv-
ing ability, and may lead to mood or 
other mental health problems.”

were installed to prevent the mind-
less wasting of natural resources.

“We have all low-flow shower 
heads and toilets and sinks, and 
we’re planning a lot of sustainability 
education for next year, too,” HDH 
sustainability manager Krista Mays 
said. 

On the green between the 
Village’s low-rise apartments, two 
bioswales collect rain for water-
conserving irrigation. 

As UCSD’s North Campus park-
ing lot is now buried beneath the 
new transfer-housing complex, most 
ERC students won’t be able to find a 
place to park. In its way, this incon-
venience will serve as an indirect 
endorsement of the university’s new 
push toward sustainability. Without 
parking, students will have to get 
used to a more local lifestyle. 

According to Cunningham, 
HDH is doing its best to make this 
change as comfortable as possible, 
with efforts such as expanding bike 
racks and — as planned for Phase 
II of Village construction — erect-
ing a supermarket and satellite 
bookstore.

John Blakely, who recently trans-
ferred from Orange Coast College in 
Costa Mesa, moved into his apart-
ment last Wednesday morning. 

“I thought, you know, I wanted 
to see what the campus was like, so 
I decided to move in,” Blakely said. 
“But I heard parking is an issue.”

Along with a cafe and 80-seat res-
ervation-only restaurant, Phase II’s 
main purpose is to ensure a second-
year housing guarantee. With more 
beds across the street, the Village 
will be able to house next year’s class 
of transfers while letting this year’s 
remain in their current apartments 
until they graduate. 

The Village is part of the univer-
sity’s long-term goal to house a total 
of 15,000 students on campus — 50 
percent of total enrollment.

In other words, the 8 a.m. roar 
of the chain saw out the ERC dorm 
windows isn’t likely going to fade 
anytime soon.

ONE WEEK OF NEW HORS D’OUVRES, HOT PERFORMANCES AND HORNY FRESHMEN

TONIGHT
“Cyrano De Bergerac,” a 19th-century 
theatrical masterpiece, is showing at the 
open-air Lowell Davies Festival Theater 
in downtown SD. The story of a big-
nosed poet with an even bigger heart, 
“Bergerac” is as hilarious as it is tragic.

Tour of  
Dreams: DIY 
Journey Waxes 
Bromantic

T he following travelogue describes a two-week West Coast tour that my band, Nobody Wave, and my 
neighborhood friends’ band, Pretend, 
embarked on this summer. It involves 
debauchery, sleeping on floors, epic 

stretches of open road and an all-
time low of personal hygiene.

It all began with a show in my 
pal Casey’s garage, filled with old 
friends and acquaintances from 
our hometown of Westlake Village. 
Calbert, Greg and I had prepared 
for the tour all week, practicing 
at Greg’s house nearly every day, 
printing flyers, spray-painting 
stencils and photocopying hand-
drawn posters. We even learned a 
cover of the Smiths’ “This Charming 
Man” and dedicated it to our 

Suburban
    Steez

Entering its sophomore year, the Loft 
— located in Price Center East — 
looks to stay afloat with a fresh round 
of indie delights for incoming dorm kids 
and mildly bemused seniors alike. The 
cafeteria-chic nightclub fancies itself a 
lime-green ray of fun in the depths of 
UCSD’s stony abyss, and we’re damn 
proud of our lil’ dance floor that could. 
Just like last year, the Loft-Off serves 
up six nights to commence the quarter, 
ranging from hip-hop regulars to cinema 
on the green. If you’re seeking a Welcome 
Week special that won’t rival the gas 
bill, look no further. Plus, it gives you an 
excuse to pregame at International House 
(as if you needed one).

W hat better way to prep for the first day of school than by cozying up to a new roomie 
on the lawn? No matter how many 
times you’ve seen it, Stanley Kubrick’s 
Cold War comedy “Dr. Strangelove or: 
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and 
Love the Bomb” is a timeless classic 
for any politically inclined, fluid-filled 
individual. Besides, it’s probably a lot 
more meaningful than it was in middle 
school, or that one time you watched 
it with your thoroughly blazed big 
brother. 

The film will be projected on 
the Price Center East Lawn. But it 
wouldn’t be an ArtPwr performance 
without the requisite artsy-fartsy 
lecture beforehand. Catch an elegantly 

coiffed David Elliot, former movie 
critic for the San Diego Union-Tribune 
and USA Today, leading a discussion 
on nuclear paranoia, Nazi comedy and 
expressionist staging before the show. 
Be sure to pack additional snacks for 
a prescreened Kubrick photo montage, 
accompanied by synth samples and 
theremin wobbles from Oceanside 
punk duo Burning of Rome. Devout 
fans can also try their luck at the 
“Kubrick quiz” to win tickets for the 
upcoming San Diego Asian Film Fest 
and private screening of “The Sleep 
Dealer” — a Mexican-made, futuristic 
mindfuck.

S treet violinist Emily Wells is back for a second time at the Loft in all her dreadlocked white-chick 
glory, stringing Vivaldi crescendos 
onto beat-up Biggie riffs like life 
was a macaroni necklace. When the 
Guardian spoke with her last, Wells 
giggled like a schoolgirl at mention 
of her prodigious history (she was 
busy snubbing record labels by the 
age of 14). She giggled, too, while 
describing her obsessions with 
both Suzuki and Tupac Shakur, 
along with a dislike for unlistenable 
“art” music. It was hard to imagine 
that trademark hollowed-out voice 
emanating from such a cheery girl, 
chilling her delicate mash-ups of 
banjo, synth and strings.

    Fast forward a year, and Wells 
is still honing her Gothic pop scores 
— so-called “symphonies” — in 
the dimly lit corners of American 
universities, remaining more an 
NPR darling than a Top 40 chart-
hopper. Her return to UCSD is 
appropriately opened by intelli-rap 
duo Portable Payback (we know, 
they sound like a shitty emo band). 
Chipped off the now-split Jurassic 
5, Soup and Marc 7even partner for 
some loungy meditation in lieu of 
debut, Relax. Should be a solid album 
soundtrack for bite-sized food from 
the Loft’s new Zanzibar restaurant.

I t’s not even Week One and your life is already falling apart. Every one of your books is already  out 
of stock at the motherfuckin’ UCSD 
Bookstore; you can’t understand your 
professor through his thick Romanian 
accent; your mom forgot to pay the 
Fall Quarter bill and you got dropped 
from all your classes. 

It’s okay — sweat it off at the 
Loft’s first dance party of the year, 
in honor of a moonless sky. UCSD’s 
hip-hop champs 220 Second to 
None (get it?) will also swing by to 
perform to the likes of Rihanna and 
Beyonce. Before you know it, you’ll 
be booty poppin’ your way to a 4.0. 
Plus, getting a little too tipsay ain’t 
a problem when your dorm room 
is right next door. Poignant cinema 

and mini sandwiches are great and 
all, but take it from us: This kind of 
midnight frenzy is what makes the 
Loft sick.

T hese aren’t your typical UCSD study bores — they can play music, and damn well, too. The 
Luminance club gives local Asian-
American musicians a stage by host-
ing a talent show for young rock 
stars at the Loft this Sunday. Singer/
songwriter Jane Lui strums haunting 
originals (highlight: “Illusionist Boy”) 
as well as a handful of classics like the 
late-great Jackson’s “Rock With You”. 
Later Cathy Nguyen takes her covers 
to a Miley Cyrus-cute, smooth-as-
honey level, sometimes even pulling 
out a Hannah Montana number (we 
hope she brings along her nimble-fin-
gered backup Andrew Garcia). Victor 
Kim of the Flex Crew then performs 
one-armed breakdance and Filipina 
Michelle Martinez purrs out that 
kinky hot shit (a la Jeremih’s “Birth-
day Sex”).

G et your highbrow fix with Jazz at Lincoln Central Orchestra, performing at the Mandeville 
Auditorium across campus. With 
a repertoire ranging from Mingus 

to Sinatra, the 15-piece orchestra is 
described as a “religious congregation” 
by its virtuoso messiah Wynton 
Marsalis, intent on “spreading the 
word of jazz.” Sounds suspiciously 
cultish.

After the show, head back to the 
Loft to catch Oakland hip-hop duo 
Zion I, loaded with beat-benders from 
latest release The Take Over (marking 
a decade since their debut.) Familiar 
faces to the campus, emcee Zion and 
producer AmpLive catapult from coast 
to coast, tangling reggae with drum ‘n 
bass with a touch of trance for a happy 
raptivism set list that tributes the days 
of De La Soul.

S pike Lee first got the idea to document tattooed stallion Kobe Bryant when he saw a 
film at Cannes profiling soccer great 
Zinedine Zidane. Lightbulb the 
American audience by framing their 
favorite sport through the eyes of 
a reigning (if somewhat infamous) 
hero. Turns out the all-star did his 
part in playing the cereal-box mascot, 
earning an MVP title to crown the 
director’s latest Afro-centric flick. 
Stick around for a post screening talk 
with UCSD Athletic Director Earl 
Edwards and men’s basketball head 
coach Chris Carlson.

T he heyday of hyphy may be behind him, but Charles Toby Bowens — better known as Keak da Sneak, or the wolf on the “Tell Me When To Go” hook — won’t stop. Not to brake 
the caddy before hopping out to ride the hood; not for a breather 
between manic full-lengths (he’s churned out nine discs in the last 
five years alone); and certainly never to clear the extraordinary 
league of crickets from his throat.

Though America’s consumer youth long tossed aside the 
stunner shades and white Ts they bought to accessorize their 
“Thizzle Dance” (first stepped by Vallejo native Mac Dre) in favor 
of imitating YouTube smash hits like Soulja Boy’s “Crank Dat”

Screenwriter Robert Siegel (“The Wrestler”) makes 
his directing debut with “Big Fan,” an underdog 
dramedy shadowing 35-year-old parking garage 
attendant Paul, who lives at home with his mom 
and calls himself the “world’s biggest New York 
Giants fan.” One night, he spots linebacker Quantrell 
Bishop at a gas station and follows him to a 
club — but just when Paul ﬁnally gathers enough 
courage to talk to his idol, he is beaten to a bloody 
pulp and hospitalized. Oh, the dark and lonely world 
of a sports fanboy. (JB)

Dade County.” Dade is, of course, Pit’s 
Miami turf — where he ﬁrst learned 
to freestyle, met Lil Jon and shaved 
his head down to a sexy sheen. Pitbull 
broke out with “Culo,” where he honed 
a bumpin’ bassline with rhymes like: 
“The night is young and if you shave/ 
I’ll give you some of this mighty tongue 
(hey).” Now with Rebelution on the 
shelves, Pitbull slams electrodance 
over Latin-ﬂavored lyrics, teachin’ the 
kids how to count in Spanish on “Calle 
Ocho,” the album’s ﬁrst overplayed 
single. Cómo? (SM)

BLUE SCHOLARS
The minute I walked onto the 

Street Scene grounds in downtown 
San Diego, I glanced up to find DJ 
Sabzi of Blue Scholars spinning 
reggae-inspired instrumentals to a 
modest crowd vibing in front of the 
Zarabanda Stage. After a few min-
utes, Sabzi introduced emcee Geo. 
The mood changed from chill to 
intense as the duo lauched into their 
set, performing songs from their 
politically charged, organically pro-
duced record Bayani. The Scholars 
drew a steady stream of head-nod-
ders, silently mouthing the words 
along with the Seattle-based crew. 

Halfway through the set, the stoic 
atmosphere morphed into an island 
party somewhere between hyphy 
and Jawaiian (in Sabzi’s own words, 
“like reggae, but cuter”) as the pair 
performed new material off their Oof 
EP. Slow nods gradually gave way to  
full-on giggin. As the Scholars fin-
ished up, most concertgoers drawn 
to Street Scene by M.I.A. were left 
wondering who the hell had just 
rocked their world for 45 minutes. 

PUBLIC ENEMY
I elbowed my way over to the 

Fulana Stage to catch some of the 
legendary Public Enemy’s set, post-
ing up at the rear of the mob. Most 
people around me could hardly 
contain their drunken hysteria over 
seeing MTV’s Flavor Flav in the 
flesh, but Chuck D stole the show 
with his assertive stage presence and 
raptivism as he followed up a com-
manding rendition of “Welcome 
to the Terrordome” with a rousing 
speech that could have come straight 
from his book “Fight the Power.” 
The crowd was eating it up. It all 
could have been mistaken for a bud-
ding freedom protest, if the lack of 
minorities wasn’t so evident. 

OF MONTREAL
After absorbing Chuck D’s wis-

dom, I dipped out and tried to snag 
a good spot for Of Montreal. Turns 
out that Public Enemy had only just 
gotten started, but the significantly 
less wasted Of Montreal fans opted 
to wait on a tardy Kevin Barnes. 
Finally, a man wearing a puma mask 
(guess who?) slinked on stage and 
the band made its grand entrance 
behind him. Per usual, the Georgia 
crew pulled out Bowie-esque the-
atrics and called on actors dressed 
in everything from furry animal 
get-ups to jumpsuits and gas masks. 
Meanwhile, lead freak Barnes’ poppy, 
yet intricate melodies drifted on 
flawlessly, keeping the Of Montreal 
faithful content despite the blister-
ing heat. 

OZOMATLI
After wandering around aimlessly 

for about 20 minutes, catching glimps-
es of sets from the Faint and LA Riots, 
Ozomatli back at the Zarabanda Stage 
seemed like a good idea. An eclectic 
mix of big band and hip-hop, salsa 
and rock, Spanish and English, the 
octet didn’t disappoint at Street Scene. 
Each jam marched to a new and dis-
tinct rhythm, enough to get even the 
whitest of folk shaking their hips. 

SILVERSUN PICKUPS
As nothing better was going down 

after Ozomatli’s set, I headed over to 
witness Silversun Pickups rocking a 
colossal mass; unfortunately, they were 
in the middle of a heated power ballad, 
interrupting my otherwise nonstop 
dance party. When they went and 
plunged into another ballad, I made 
the educated decision to peace out.

Nonstop
Dance Party 
Sweeps the 
SD Streets

BASSNECTAR
In a stroke of luck, I descended 

upon the DJ-of-the-evening 
Bassnectar just as the long-haired 
genius was spinning his remix of 
Rick Ross’ “Hustlin’.” No doubt, the 
man loves his bass. Not only could 
we feel the super-low tones through-
out our bodies, we could watch the 
rest of the crowd ripple right along 
with them. It was epic for a while, 
but there’s only so much heavy low-
end you can handle after a long day 
of hot sets, so I left midway through 
the 90-minute show.

SHARON JONES AND THE DAP-KINGS
Somehow, I had thus far over-

looked the significant number of 
folks over 40 in attendance. They 
became much more apparent when 
they all congregated to watch 
Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings 
close out the Zarabanda — and 
damn do those old people know 
what’s up. Watching Jones for just 
a couple minutes, I immediately 
found out why she was headlining 
the Zarabanda — the girl’s got swag, 
and can sing soul better than almost 
anyone from this era. She even 

brought a middle-aged man from the 
audience onstage and serenaded him 
for an entire song, eliciting cheers of 
approval from the crowd. 

The Dap-Kings weren’t too shab-
by either, backing Jones in typical 
big-band fashion. Gotta love it.

M.I.A.
If anyone forgot that the Beastie 

Boys were originally penciled in to 
headline that night, M.I.A. made 
sure to painfully jog our memory. 
After rapidly shouting the lyrics to 
several of her songs — a feat she 

attempted to pass off as rap — she 
decided to “pay homage” to the 
absent Beastie Boys by “freestyling” 
over their classic instrumentals. 
Truly horrifying. 

Despite ruining timeless beats 
from hip-hop’s most beloved trio, 
M.I.A. did end the festival on a 
significantly happier note — the 
uber catchy “Paper Planes” was just 
enough to get the audience pumped 
for the drive home.

T he Burning Plain” opens with a trailer exploding on an empty plain in New Mexico. 
Thankfully, the rest of the film is 

less predictable, although no easier 
to digest.

In a style reminiscent of his two 
previous hits — “21 Grams” and 
“Babel” — acclaimed screenwriter 
and freshman director Guillermo 
Arriaga proceeds to untangle a 
sequentially jumbled knot of events 
that straddles past and present. 
Repeatedly revealing the effect before 
the cause, Arriaga asks the audience 
to sit tight for the first head-scratch-
ing 45 minutes as multiple seem-
ingly unrelated storylines follow one 
another in unabashedly disjointed 
fragments.

We begin in New Mexico, pre-
sumably 10 years ago, where Gina 
(Kim Basinger), an unhappily mar-
ried mother of four, engages in 
sexual escapades with Nick (Joaquim 
de Almeida), a married man. Every 
afternoon, the two sneak away from 
their families and meet up halfway 
at a secluded trailer. During one 
such adventure, the trailer goes up in 
flames, killing the two lovers.

Flash forward to present-day 
Oregon, where we meet Sylvia 
(Charlize Theron), a hostess at a 

swanky seaside restaurant who 
— despite a glowing exterior that 
might suggest a healthy, put-together 
life — spends her free time having 
meaningless sex with strangers and 
cutting herself. To top it off, a suspi-
cious, unidentified man appears to 
be stalking her. 

Confused yet? 
Let’s throw in a blossoming 

relationship between Gina’s teen-
age daughter Mariana (Jennifer 
Lawrence) and Nick’s son Santiago 
(J.D. Pardo), along with a side riff 
about an injured crop-duster and his 
little girl. The result is a near two-
hour “Degrassi” episode covering all 

the tough issues from adultery and 
plastic surgery to teen pregnancy, 
self-mutilation and death.

Yes, eventually all the mysterious 
page-turners are explained, but only 
the most patient viewer will still care 
after being suffocated by the emo-
tional weight of the underdeveloped 
characters’ failed relationships, betray-
als, unrealized dreams and guilt.

The pretty bow at the end doesn’t 
make this melodrama any less unset-
tling or morose. While Arriaga is 
celebrated for his ability to weave a 
multithreaded plotline by establish-
ing continuity between each self-
contained short story, he appears to 

have bit off more than he can chew, 
often at the actors’ expense.

Theron and Basinger deliver 
when given the opportunity, but sev-
eral scenes exhaust their heartrend-
ing potential when Arriaga snaps the 
viewer out of their cinematic trance 
in order to show off his overused 
splicing skills.

Save for Robert Elswit’s dreamlike 
cinematography, a distracting flood 
of bird, scar and window motifs jux-
taposed with a blatant orange-versus-
blue separation of past and present 
makes Arriaga’s latest look more like 
a film-school final than the work of 
an Oscar nominee.

Y our student-loan dollars are burning a hole in your pocket and you’re jonesing for explo-
sions and blood-soaked revenge, 

but you’ve already seen Tarantino’s 
“Inglorious Basterds” — is there 
anything worth ditching the first 
day of class for?

The good news is that Landmark 
Theaters just started showing 
“Flame and Citron,” and it’s almost 

similar enough to “Basterds” to 
quench your bloodthirst — but 
there are some caveats.

For one, the movie’s entirely in 
Danish. 

Set in Copenhagen in the mid-
dle of WWII, “Citron” is the true 

story of two obsessed resistance 
fighters, supported by the UK and 
the Danish government-in-exile, 
who together kill dozens of col-
laborators. But when they realize 
their cell’s been compromised, their 
resistance disintegrates into a gory 
patchwork of revenge and wartime 
betrayal.

Ruthless pretty boy Flame (Thure 
Lindhardtv — you wouldn’t know 
him) takes the vendetta-fueled 
struggle to tear-jerking, brutally 
emotional heights. On his way to a 
troop meeting after being wounded, 
he walks with a jagged step, his 
relentless gaze hard and cold. The 
fact that he hardly mellows when 
femme fatale Ketty (Stine Stengade) 
enters the picture sets him apart as 
a man wholly consumed by intense 
personal strife.

For all Flame’s intensity, though, 
his partner is the film’s strongest 
character. Citron (Mads Mikkelsen,

or the New Boyz’ “Jerk,” the sparse 
beats and sneering choreography of 
those newer limb-flailers certainly 
borrow the freakishly high energy 
level made mainstream by hyphy. 

Keak doesn’t exactly have the 
option of trying his luck outside 
the genre. The raspy, homely rapper 
holds the high honor of first-ever 
emcee to use the word “hyphy” on 
record (thus providing his turn-
of-the-century Bay Area hip-hop 
movement with its official name). 
Since then, he hasn’t written a 
single lyric that doesn’t namedrop 
the movement, and track titles 
follow suite: “Yadameen,” “T-Shirt, 
Blue Jeans, & Nikes,” “Hyphie,” 
“Super Hyphy,” “E-Yes,” “Who 
Started Hyphy,” “Stunna Shadez 
On,” “Go Dumb Go Stupid” and 
“Hyphy Wifey,” to name a few. 
And the list goes on, alongside 
satisfactorily stranger stuff like 
“Light Gray Stuff ” and “N Front Ya’ 
Mama House.”

Really, he’s a must-have cameo 
on any true-blood hyphy track; 
without Keak around, who would 
waddle in with padlock-shaped 
facial hair to wheeze out a pervy 
chorus and clammy verse to air out 
his guttural contemporaries? E-40’s 
2006 “Tell Me When to Go” was a 
culmination of the entire movement 
(and, though they couldn’t know 
it at the time, sort of signaled the 
coming end): All hyphy’s starting 
players crashed the video, collars 
a-pop, from Mistah F.A.B. to Too 
Short to Turf Talk; they talked 
stupid, dumb, shades, dreads 
and grills; Lil Jon made sure the 
classic Bay beat never exceeded the 
experience of a cheaply cut E trip 
and would sound just as hot on our 
shittiest speakers. 

But Keak — who has bragged 
he wrote the “Go” hook in five 
minutes, which does explain a lot 

— steals the show, sucking all the 
oxygen E-40 gasps for and then 
some, whizzing past his voice box 
without picking up anything over 
a squeak, riding it like the metal 
ball in a tin whistle. Making inner-
city and bored university kids 
everywhere wonder: Maybe if I 
fry my brain to a crisp with pretty 
lights and speed-cut happy pills, 
stuff a couple foxtails up my nose 
and grunt half-asleep obscenities 
through it, I too can live the 
glamorous life of Keak. 

Friday’s free show in Price Center 
Plaza is slated for an 8 p.m. to 10 
p.m. time slot — tight fit for a spool 
as loose as the king of hyphy, who’s 

always been 
more about 
mind-numbing 
quantity than 
anything short 
and sweet: 
His albums 
are meant to 
spin on repeat, 
ensuring the 
cough-syrup 
all-nighter 
don’t end 
before every 
last brain cell is 
good and dead. 
One goofy 
trampoline beat 
zings ceaselessly 
into the next, 
high-strung 
in spandex 
catcalls and 
husky hairballs 
wriggling their 
way from his 
raw buzzing 

throat through the brainwaves of 
a zonked sea of followers. With no 
signs of stopping.

Keak da Sneak will perform live 
with Millionaires in Price Center 
Plaza on Friday, Sept. 25.

friend Soaps, who has a thing for 
Morrissey. Casey’s sealed garage 
was packed with sweaty folks who 
helped us get psyched for the 12-
show journey ahead. 

After we had stuffed the gear and 
merch back in our cars, the bands 

took a delirious 
group photo 
in front of 
Pretend’s newly 
acquired econo-
van, donated 
to them by a 
middle-aged 
lady friend. 
They would 
carry all the 
equipment, and 
Nobody Wave 
(plus our party-
animal roadie 
Ranj) would 
follow in a whip 
of our own.

The next 
morning, I filled a school backpack 
with clothes and toiletries — enough 
to get me through a week, tops. 
Around 2 p.m., Greg, Cal and Ranj 
showed up with our loaner ride, a 
fairly new Honda Accord. Greg’s dad 
had a business associate named Jose, 
a “developer,” who got us the car, no 
questions asked. We cruised over to 
Vons for some road snacks and cheap 
eats (pasta, cereal, fruit) and then hit 
the 101 toward UC Santa Barbara. 

That night’s show took place on 
a patio overlooking the ocean, with 
a sign reading “Danger Cliff ” on the 
fence behind us. Despite the thick 

mist and fog rolling in — soaking 
our gear as we played — the show 
was a success, with drunken friends 
arriving in caravans to see us off. We 
said our final goodbyes and crashed 
at Ranj’s new apartment after some 
late-night talk over bowls of said 
cereal and Super Smash Bros. 

Eleven heads passed out on the 
carpeted floor in personal mummy 
bags. 

We slept in late, called dibs on 
showers and wolfed down breakfast 
burritos at Super Cucas before 
heading out of Isla Vista and up the 
coast toward San Luis Obispo. A 
group called DIY SLO was putting 
on the day’s epic Mountain Show, but 
we were a bit nervous about it even 
happening at all, considering the 
shadiness of their instructions: We 
were told to “meet at the gazebo” of a 
local park, so we could all carpool up 
an unmarked road off the 101 to the 
top of a rustic mountain, where we 
would play. 

Rad, in theory. 
Sadly, those who came to watch 

us were crusty punks who mostly 
just wanted to drop acid as the sun 
went down. Our audience couldn’t 
care less about the music, but beggars 
can’t be choosers, so we took two 
weirdos in our car and Pretend took 
the other two. One of them threw up 
on the curb before climbing in. 

When we got to the mountain 
road, we knew it wasn’t going to 
happen. The Honda kept bottoming 
out as we dipped into pothole after 
pothole. The econo-van fared even 
worse, stalling only a quarter of the 
way up. Matt, the show’s promoter, 

said that of all the mountain shows 
they’d ever done, only one band’s 
van had ever broken down. Hard to 
believe, as this was the worst road I 
had ever driven on. 

We decided it wasn’t worth it to 
risk the whole tour for one weird 
show, so we let the crusty dudes out 
and turned back. To salvage the rest 
of the night at our friends’ condo in 
SLO, they prepared us a pasta and 
chicken feast. We bonded over Soul 
Calibur marathons, budget beer and 
our favorite: OG local band Respira. 

“We’re Nobody Wave, and there’s 
nobody here,” Calbert said behind 
his drums as we stood in the back 
of Streetlight Records, surrounded 
by vinyl. We had driven from SLO 
to Santa Cruz, and were passing out 
flyers on Pacific Avenue and waiting 
for Pretend to show up in the van. 
They had brought it to a repair shop 
that morning and were stuck until 
the mechanics finished. Luckily, 
Streetlight gave us some slack and we 
let us start over an hour late. 

The record shop was empty aside 
from a handful of people browsing. 
One bored older man across the 
store decided to count off one of 
our songs, so I guess he was into it. 
Afterward, we gorged ourselves at an 
Indian food buffet to keep up morale 
after this series of setbacks. Later that 
night, we’d be playing another house 
show at my good friend Stephen’s 
place nearby. 

Did the cops turn up? Did homies 
even show? Had we made a huge 
mistake, eating all that Indian food 
right before? Find out next week in 
Part II.

Dear Members of the UCSD Campus Community: 
 
As you are aware, excessive alcohol consumption poses a threat to our students and the community in 
which they live.  In an effort to minimize problematic drinking we are collaborating with community 
leaders to ensure that our students are aware of their responsibilities when hosting or attending social 
gatherings.  We also want to remind them of their duty to protect the safety and wellbeing of their 
guests and neighbors.  Starting this Fall 09, we will work towards reducing the risks associated with 
drinking in the following ways:

  Party Patrols: campus and city police will increase their patrols in neighborhoods 

surrounding the campus. 
 
 Compliance Checks: campus and city police will increase efforts to make sure retailers 

who sell alcohol are doing so within the limits of the law (i.e. checking ID, not serving/selling 
to underage customers, not over-serving customers, etc.) 

 
 DUI Checkpoints: campus and city police will jointly facilitate more sobriety checkpoints 

near the campus and throughout San Diego. 
 
By this time, we all know about the tragedies that can result from unwise choices around alcohol, and 
that alcohol abuse is a serious societal problem.  Together, we can make our campus and local 
community a fun and safe place to live and socialize responsibly.  We are very proud of the nationally 
acclaimed programs we have to educate and raise awareness on our campus, and the fact that most 
UCSD students make healthy choices.  But mostly, we are proud of YOU, the students and members of 
the community.  Let’s all make a commitment to our collective responsibility, and work together in 
continuing to keep our campus safe.  If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to 
contact Lupe Samaniego-Kraus at (858) 534-3874.

LA has seen a glut of Smell bands rise from the dregs of downtown loft shows to blog prominence — and HEALTH is a noise-glam standout. 
The foursome melted faces in 2007 with their self-

titled debut, finding a balance between all-out squall 
and spastic post-punk. They even tried their hand at 
throwback dance remixes on HEALTH//DISCO in 2008, 
from which they borrow aural cues on sophomore 
release, Get Color. 

Lead single “Die Slow” pulses like any good acid 
techno track should, but guitar tones expand to bump 
and grind in detached, sterile fashion, creating a repul-
sive sexual undertow. In a self-directed clip for the 
song, supermodels march like coked-out fembots while 
a mass of bodies writhes in its own blood, the group’s 
performance driving the spectacle to new levels of gross. 
While Get Color finds HEALTH using guitar texture 
and gritty feedback, the group remain within their 
prescribed genre box, rarely straying from the ghostly 
vocals and drumline beats that first got them noticed. 

Still, on “Eat Flesh,” wonky chords culminate in a 
more hypnotic and structured whole, as Jake Duzsik’s 
voice lulls in and out of focus. “We Are Water” lends 
kraut-rock repetition to a dance-arena buildup, giving 
HEALTH their first genuine anthem complete with 
climax and resolution. 

Bringing up the rear is minimalist techno track “In 
Violet,” unnaturally subtle and surprising coming from 
noisy dudes like these, showing a willingness to tinker 
with their steez on albums to come.

F itting snugly into the blogger-fueled trend of combining the most obscure genres possible — new wave to chill-wave, lo-fi to no-fi to glo-fi — South Carolina nobody 
Ernest Greene mashes ’80s cheese into New Age pads and 
gobs of reverb for the Washed Out bedroom project. After 
amassing buzz with just a seven-inch single and a cassette 
tape, Greene has finally come through with the Life of 
Leisure EP, available only in digital and vinyl formats. 

The six-song release operates on the same level as retro-
chill contemporary Neon Indian, never straying far from the 
predictably innocent sound palette that gets Scottish duo 
Boards of Canada so much play. Cuts like “New Theory” pair 
bassy 4/4 beats with a teenage wistfulness, leaning heavily 
on unintelligible vocals and bargain-bin-vinyl production. 
Greene fuses it all together in a way that’s unoriginal yet 
somehow inspiring, showcasing his timeless tastes on his 
sleeve without venturing too far into the unknown. 

But then comes “Feel It All Around,” a track so damn 
immediate and pleasing, a honed breath of shoegaze and mini-
mal disco bathed in fuzz — a track that doesn’t have to explain 
itself. The message from the like-minded collection of no-fi 
musicians is clear: fun in the sun, sound quality be damned. 

Greene’s songs end unexpectedly, which might be a delib-
erate aesthetic choice, now that it’s hot to sound like shit. A 
song like “You’ll See It” revels in its worn-tape mix fading in 
and out, and awkward Casio presets somehow feeling again. 

Washed Out may just be the next musical contradiction 
to get its junk washed by the online community, but Life of 
Leisure’s pop melodies seep through the self-imposed murk 
to at least make the trend a pleasant one.

Looking in the Mirror to Rock Out

Southern Comfort Stays Close to the 
Sunny Side of  New-Wave Pop Trends

Character-Driven ‘Citron’  
Dragged on By Daily Grind
Chiffre in the new “James Bond”) 
teeters so dangerously on razor’s edge 
between self-pity and mental derange-
ment that he makes the audience 
uncomfortable. His fumbling attempts 
at keeping his family together are so 
inept that one can’t help but feel a tad 
embarrassed — then gradually horri-
fied — as he ultimately resolves to let 
his loved ones drift beyond his final 
grasps.

This isn’t a typical kill-’em-all war 
drama — no happy balance of fam-
ily and fighting emerges in the end, 
and extended scenes of gratuitous 
street violence are entirely neglected. 
Rather, this is a true-story movie 
(at least, never having shot Nazis 
in occupied Europe myself, it feels 
true). The direction is never heavy-
handed, and most of the tension is 
found in quieter moments rather 

than in shouting matches or dra-
matic camera angles. As a result, the 
story, the situation, and the actors 
themselves take center stage — with-
out benefit of a stirring score or 
overt foreshadowing.

For all that, though, “Flame and 
Citron” never quite crosses into gotta-
have-it territory, for one simple rea-
son: It’s not engaging. The characters 
are surely compelling, but let’s face 
it — intricate character development 
is only captivating at a soap opera’s 
pace. Without adrenaline-pumped 
action or any semblance of humor, 
the film rapidly deflates (such is the 
fate of many a slow-moving, subtitled 
arthouse flick). 

Hate to say it, but if it’s a question 
between going to your first class and 
throwing down a ten-spot for this 
one, you might actually want to grit 
your teeth and sit through the lecture.

ing, as well. Samra had an up-and-
down season last year, playing well 
through the first half but struggling 
later in the season. 

Okasaki and Samra will be joined 
by junior-college transfer Richard 
Morris in the No. 3 spot, and sopho-
mores Mike Tilghman 
and Mike Neustadt in 
the fourth and fifth posi-
tions, respectively. With 
four of the top five players 
returning from last season, 
head coach Mike Wydra 
is optimistic heading into 
the season.

“Based on the quality 
of play this summer, we 
will be much improved 
this year,” Wydra said. 
“They have all played in 
a variety of amateur tour-
naments, starting with 
the U.S. Open Qualifying 
tournament. Our players 
had low rounds in big 
tournaments, which is a good indica-
tor of how they’ll play throughout the 
year.”

Wydra has no doubt that returning 
the No. 1 and No. 2 men along with 
adding Morris, will give the Tritons a 
competitive edge in what is arguably 
the toughest region in the nation. Last 
season, teams from the West Region 
finished first, second and sixth at the 

NCAA National Championships, with 
Sonoma State winning the national 
title.

“It’s such a tough region that just 
hanging around would be pretty 
good,” Wydra said. “But in the infa-
mous words of Ben Crenshaw before 
the final day at the 1999 Ryder Cup, I 

have a good feeling [about 
this season].”

Wydra’s hopes will be 
tested against a stellar field 
at the WWU Invitational. 
The Tritons look to 
improve on last year’s sev-
enth-place finish against 
a field that includes reign-
ing national champion 
Sonoma State. In each of 
the past three years, UCSD 
has steadily bettered its 
previous year’s finish.

Against such top com-
petition, Wydra said he 
has a few tricks concealed. 
Wydra’s tactics revolve 
around his players’ mind-

set within their group.
“They need to refuse to lose to 

anyone in their group,” Wydra said. 
“One player can’t affect the overall 
war. But if each of our players can win 
his battle within his group, then we as 
a team can win the war.”

Readers can contact Matt Croskey at 
mcroskey@ucsd.edu.

Cerritos College, and the Triton 
team’s efforts were enough to earn 
the overall victory.

“So far, Brian’s done a real nice 
job,” Garcia said. “I 
think he’s really well 
prepared so far.” 

Following the sea-
son opener, the Tritons 
traveled to Irvine to 
compete in the Asics/
UC Irvine Invitational 
on Sept. 12. Senior 
Mike Wright led the 
Tritons to a sixth-place 
finish out of 21 teams 
on the men’s side, 
finishing 32nd indi-
vidually with a time 
of 26:09.0. Schofield 
led the women to the 
eighth spot with her 
fifth-place individual 
finish at 17:45.0. 

“She’s definitely 
much more comfort-
able with the sport,” Garcia said. 
“Last year was her first year run-
ning cross country, and she is 
ahead of where she was last year at 
this time. We’re really excited about 
the rest of the season.”

Schofield was named the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Female Runner of the 
Week on Sept. 14. In her freshman 

campaign last season, Schofield 
finished 22nd in harsh conditions 
at the NCAA Division II National 
Championships, and was named an 
All-American. 

The start of this 
season also marks the 
return of senior Dan 
Anderson, who missed 
all but the first few 
races of the team’s 2008 
campaign due to injury. 
Anderson finished 19th 
out of a field of 37 run-
ners in Irvine, compet-
ing in his second race in 
almost a year. 

The Tritons can 
only hope that having a 
healthy Anderson will 
catalyze the team.

UCSD looks to 
continue its success-
ful sprint out of the 
gate at the Southern 
Indiana Pre-National 
Invitational on Sept. 26 

in Evansville, Ind. against  teams 
from all over the country.

“We’ve had a real good start 
to the season,” Garcia said. “We’re 
pleased with where we’re at and we 
have great returning talent as well 
as freshmen.

the season as one of UCSD’s four 
captains.

UCSD started the year on a posi-
tive note, thanks in part to McTigue’s 
strong play.

In its season opener on Aug. 
29 against Central Washington, 
McTigue gave UCSD a 2-1 victory 
with her game-winning score dur-
ing double overtime, one of her 
team-high four goals of the season. 
McTigue also has eight points, tied 
for the team lead with freshman 
midfielder Jessica Wi.

“It’s not ever about being the 
leading scorer,” McTigue said. “It’s 
about going out there as a team, 
working together and trying to get 
a win.”

Head coach Brian McManus 
— now in his 23rd season at the 
helm and owner of the third high-
est winning percentage in NCAA 
women’s soccer history — sees 
a common denominator among 
McTigue, Wi, and the entire team, 
which he said will preserve the 
team’s success.

“They all have good skills, excel-
lent reading of the game and a desire 
to do well,” McManus said.

begin its ascent toward a national title.
After an embarrassing first-

round defeat to Cal State Los 
Angeles in last season’s NCAA West 
Regionals, this year’s squad has 
shown its determination to make up 
for last year’s early exit. Displaying 
a resilience that the Tritons hope 
will define them this season, UCSD 
knocked off the very same Cal State 
Los Angeles team on Sept. 19 in a 
thrilling five-set match.

“We had some tough losses last 
year,” head coach Tom Black said. 
“And after those, the team just made a 
commitment to themselves. This year, 
they’ve all been on the same page, and 
our dedication has really improved 
our play. This is one of the best teams 
that I have seen here.”

The only blemish so far for the 
Tritons — who won their first 10 

games of the season — came on 
Sept. 11 when they took their first 
loss in four sets to second-ranked 
Cal State San Bernardino. UCSD will 
get a get a chance for revenge against 
the San Bernardino Coyotes on Oct. 
17, playing this time in front of the 
home fans. 

“We’re determined,” senior outside 
hitter Sylvia Schmidt said. “We’re 
aiming a push for the championship. 
We’re excited for another year, and 
everyone is working hard to get there.”

UCSD, who has not made it to 
the NCAA National Championships 
since 2006, will return home for the 
start of Fall Quarter to host a pair of 
weekend matches on Sep. 25 and Sept. 
26 against Chico State and Cal State 
Stanislaus, respectively. 

Readers can contact Tyler Nelson at 
tcnelson@ucsd.edu.

The Tritons took their first and 
only loss of the season in front of 
a whopping 1,796 fans at Cal State 
Stanislaus on Sept. 18. A late defensive 
leak led to a comeback victory for the 
CSUS Warriors, sparked by junior 
forward Victor Regalado  — the cur-
rent California Collegiate Athletic 
Association scoring leader. 

UCSD senior defender Daniel 
Pavitt led the Triton attack by notch-
ing his first career goal on a free kick 
from inside the center circle in the 
game’s 15th minute. Senior goalkeeper 
Peter Akman anchored the defense 
with six saves. 

After outshooting the Warriors 
15-6 in the first half, CSUS retook the 
game’s momentum in the second half.

Regalado — who has scored eight 
goals in the Warriors’ first seven 
games — single-handedly led his team 

to a comeback. The game-winning 
goal came in the 90th minute, as 
Regalado rebounded a teammate’s free 
kick and shot it past Akman. 

The Tritons suffered their first loss 
after back-to-back 0-0 ties at Cal State 
Monterey Bay and San Francisco State 
on Sept. 11 and Sept. 13.

 Throughout the season’s first 
eight games, UCSD has shown a very 
strong defense backing an underde-
veloped and dormant offense. 

“So far, we’ve really been working 
hard and playing as a team. We’ve 
been scoring goals by moving the 
ball around and have brought in a 
lot of new contributing players that 
have done really well,” senior keeper 
Akman said. “We’ve been playing 
really well defensively and will soon 
see a flurry of goals being scored on 
offense.”

Inexperience at the collegiate level 

has not proven to be an obstacle to 
the 2009 Tritons, as Pascale has given 
his new crop of freshmen a significant 
amount of playing time. 

“It’s great to see that we have 
such a deep bench and that anyone 
can step up to the plate when called 
upon,” Akman said. “The bench 
is vital and can really support the 
team and push us forward. Coach 
Jon pushes the team on and off 
the field, and leads by example. He 
pushes us to really fight and play 
with energy — especially the older 
players.”

Looking for their first conference 
winof the season, UCSD travels to 
Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 25, before 
heading to Cal State San Bernardino 
on Sept. 27.

Readers can contact Cameron Tillisch at 
ctillisc@ucsd.edu.

Hendrick said. “Everything I did, he did 
— he always aspired to be like me, but sur-
passed me in every way.”

The brothers shared the same high-
school record in the sport: 15 feet 4 inches.

Roach’s teammate, sophomore Allison 
Rudd, described him as an “incredible 
teammate and friend with the most amazing 
character, work ethic and positive attitude.” 

Rudd was also Roach’s bible-study part-
ner. 

“He was so confident that when he 
would die he’d go to heaven, and had such a 
hope in the fact that god had a greater plan 
and a calling for his life,” she said.

In a 2001 study, the American Journal 
of Sports Medicine ranked pole vaulting as 
having the highest death rate per partici-
pant of any sport. 

In 2002, 19-year-old Penn State student 

Kevin Dare died in a pole-vaulting accident 
after suffering serious injuries to the head. 
Dare’s father tried to make the sport safer 
for athletes by helping design and market 
the first helmet made specifically for pole 
vaulters. 

“Leon wouldn’t have wanted helmets to 
be required,” Hendrick said.

Mary Ann Roach emphasized the fact 
that she is not blaming anyone for the acci-
dent. 

“We hold no hard feelings toward UCSD 
or the coaches. Leon loved everyone down 
there,” she said. 

Three UCSD track-and-field coaches 
declined to comment on the exact nature of 
the drill Roach was performing at the time 
of his death.

said. “Our coaches put conditioning 
at the top of our list as a necessary 
advantage we need to have over other 
teams.”

The two wins against tough 
Eastern opponents reflect the team’s 
off-season productivity.

“This off-season we worked on 
creating a very efficient counter-attack 
offense and defense,” Roberts said. 
“Wearing down teams is the mentality 
UCSD brings to every game.”

The Tritons look to ring in the 
first day of classes by hosting longtime 
rival LMU on Sept. 24. Due to the 

temporary closure of the Canyonview 
Aquatic Center, the Tritons will 
host the Lions at the Coggan Family 
Aquatic Complex adjacent to La Jolla 
High School at 6 p.m.

existing systems in place that attempt 
to close the performance gap, but nei-
ther MLB’s system of revenue sharing 
nor its “luxury tax” come anywhere 
close to creating equal competition. 
Revenue sharing stipulates that each 
of the 30 teams must fork over 30 per-
cent of their profits to be distributed 
evenly amongst all teams, but there is 
no requirement that this money must 
be spent on players’ salaries. This cre-
ates a giant loophole that has allowed 
numerous owners to pocket millions 
by deliberately keeping their salaries 
down. 

In 2003, the smaller-market 
Florida Marlins won the World Series 
with a respectable payroll of $54 mil-
lion. That team was built around a 
mix of veterans and budding stars that 
included Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell, 
Brad Penny and Ivan Rodriguez. 
Instead of retaining these players 
and making a run at more titles, 
Marlins ownership dismantled the 
team through free agency and trades, 
enabling its payroll to drop all the way 
down to $14.9 million in 2006, nearly 
20 percent of the league average. 
Doing so qualified Florida to receive 
a league-high $31 million in revenue-
sharing dollars, not a cent of which 
went to fielding a more talented team, 
but instead made up the majority of its 
MLB-best $43 million profit in 2006.

Baseball’s second system is the 
competitive balance tax (aka the “lux-
ury tax”) a stipulation just as flawed 
as the first. This places a tax on team 

payrolls that go over a preset ceiling 
that changes every year, but which 
is set so high — $162 million for the 
2009 season — that it realistically only 
applies to baseball’s top-two spending 
teams, the New York Yankees and the 
Boston Red Sox. 

If baseball’s primary check on team 
inequality promotes greedy ownership, 
and its secondary check only impacts 
a fraction of the league, how can the 
majority of teams ever have a realistic 
shot at becoming competitive? 

The fact that seven different teams 
have won a World Series since 2001 
— none of them being the dreaded 
Yankees — is a step in the right direc-
tion. But the fact that only two of 
those teams, the ’01 Diamondbacks 
and the ’03 Marlins, can be considered 
small-market shows that revenue shar-
ing has less to do with seven different 
champions in eight years than Bud 
Selig would have us think. 

Only by implementing a salary cap 
can baseball hope to see more teams 
in competition late in the season — 
teams that have have a real shot at 
winning. The type of “hard cap” used 
in other professional sports makes it 
so that teams cannot spend over a set 
amount on team payroll. The NFL sets 
its hard cap at $128 million per team 
while the NBA holds their team sala-
ries to a mere $59 million a year. Each 
of those leagues has seen its share of 
dynasties in the recent past, but they 
have also taken the important first step 
of limiting the lavish spending that has 
come to define baseball in the Scott 

Boras era of free agency. The fact that 
Barry Zito signed for $126 million is 
evidence enough to create a salary cap.

Imagine if the Yankees couldn’t 
sign Mark Teixeira for the absurd 
amount of $180 million, and he 
instead signed with his hometown 
team, the Baltimore Orioles. Or if, 
instead of taking $161 million to play 
in New York pinstripes, CC Sabathia 
re-signed with the Milwaukee Brewers 
and led them through another playoff 
race. With just those two examples, 
you bring one dominating team 
slightly back down to earth while 
two underperforming clubs receive a 
much-needed boost. 

The reality is that most teams will 
not be in contention come September 
of any given year. Does this mean that 
fans, players and all 30 teams don’t 
deserve at least a fighting chance? 
Yankees President Hank Steinbrenner, 
who — at the helm of the world’s rich-
est ball club stands to lose the most 
from any changes — said this about 
revenue sharing and a salary cap: 
“That’s a system I don’t particularly 
like. It’s a socialist system, and I don’t 
agree with it. Is it even American?”

Well, Uncle Hank has put it in its 
simplest form: You’re either a true 
American patriot who wants to let 
the free market determine who wins a 
World Series, or you’re a Fidel-loving, 
Molotov-throwing commie who 
wants more competitive equality. Well 
then, comrade, pour yourself a shot of 
vodka and grab a seat on the couch, 
because the game’s about to start.

The senior outside hitter notched 13 kills to lead UCSD 
through a three-set sweep against conference rival Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. With 911 career kills, Schmidt 
has moved into 10th place all-time in UCSD history.

How the 
Little Guy 
Can Win 
Again
F or the entire month of September, there has been a grand total of one race for any 
of the eight playoff spots. Even then, 
the one “legitimate” playoff race has 
been for the National League wild 
card, where (and it kills me to admit 
this) the San Francisco Giants’ anemic 
offense has been working overtime to 
try and make even this one existing 
race irrelevant. 

While playoff games in October 
might reveal which teams have supe-
rior talent and an actual chance to 
win a World Series, September is the 
time for the second-, third- and even 
fourth-place teams to keep dream-
ing a bit. Before magic numbers can 
be counted on one hand, and while 
a third of the league is still separated 
by five games in the wild-card race, 
September is normally the month in 
which most teams have something to 
play for. 

For as good as the current month 
should be, there is a slight hitch: This 
September has been about as inter-
esting as sitting through a Pirates-
Nationals doubleheader. The eight 
teams that currently hold playoff 
berths are exactly the same teams that 
led their respective divisions a whole 
month ago, engendering a month of 
— for what it’s worth — meaningless 
baseball games.

Why is it that nearly two-thirds of 
major league teams find themselves 
with nothing to play for with over a 
fifth of the season left? How come 
certain teams find themselves in 
contention year after year while other 
teams have been written off since the 
first day of spring training?

The complete lack of parity in 
baseball stems largely from the huge 
gap in spending between the fewer, 
wealthier teams and the remaining 
poorer ball clubs. OK, so any orga-
nization where the minimum salary 
is 400K a year can hardly be con-
sidered proletarian, but baseball has 
the ability to make September —and 
consequently the season as a whole 
— interesting and competitive again 
by creating a much more level playing 
field. 

How to do this? Simple: Institute a 
salary cap.

Unlike its stepbrothers in the NFL 
and the NBA, Major League Baseball 
has no salary cap, meaning that 
any team can spend as much as it is 
capable in order to field a team. But 
this is America – the land of oppor-
tunity, one might say – where any 
person has the potential to defy his or 
her surroundings and rise to capital-
istic glory. Does this belief carry over 
into baseball, the official pastime of 
the American dream? Under its cur-
rent system, Major League Baseball 
has created so much financial and 
structural disparity that lowly teams 
like the Kansas City Royals and the 
Washington Nationals have, in reality, 
about as much a chance of winning 
the World Series as a poor, strug-
gling family of five has of receiving 
adequate health care from President 
Obama.

Holding high hopes for another 
promising season, the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team has begun 
Fall Quarter by scaling the national 
rankings with a 12-1 record. A third 
of the season already behind them, 
the Tritons now look forward to 
playing before full stands of stu-
dents drawn to RIMAC Areana by 
Welcome Week activities and events. 

UCSD was ranked 13th in the

Despite a large proportion of incoming freshmen 
players, the 2009 UCSD men’s soccer team has quickly 
jumped to a 3-1-4 record. Goals have been scarce since 
their Sept. 4 season kick-off, but team chemistry and 
resulting victories have begun to pick up for the Tritons 
and second-year head coach Jon Pascale. 

Facing Chico State on Sept. 20., the Tritons initially 
got on the board thanks to a first-half goal from fresh-

man forward Evan Walker and stingy goalkeeping from 
Akman for a 1-1 tie. Despite being their fourth draw in 
only eight games, the game versus a difficult Chico State 
squad showed a resilience that Pascale hopes will define 
the 2009 season.

“We’ve been faced with a lot of adversity these last 
few weeks, but we’ve remained in good spirits and have 
played real well,” Pascale said. “We felt like we were the far 
better team [against CSUS], but couldn’t score goals.”

As the defending California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
champions, the UCSD women’s 
soccer team has a lot to live up 
to. After winning seven of the last 
eight conference titles, the team 
was picked to win the CCAA in a 
preseason coaches’ poll. 

Similarly, UCSD was ranked 
18th in the nation by the National 
Soccer Coaches Association of 
America before a single game ball 

had been kicked. 
High expectations aside, this 

year’s squad has generated a buzz 
by accelerating to an impressive 
5-1 record.

With such a rich tradition of 
conference dominance, the Tritons 
hope to build on past success in 
2009. Asked about her team’s aspi-
rations for the new season, senior 
midfielder Alexia Zatarain put it 
simply: “To go to the final four and 
repeat as CCAA champions.” 

Zatarain is the only senior on 
a team that has traditionally relied 

on a solid veteran core. However, 
sophomore forward Sarah McTigue 
has already been a major contribu-
tor for the Tritons and is an exam-
ple of the younger Triton players 
who have stepped into productive 
roles.

With two goals and seven 
assists in her freshman season, 
McTigue finished the season tied 
for second on the team in scoring, 
with 11 points. As a result of her 
strong performance, she began

The No. 17 Tritons head 
into their annual first-day-of-
school match against No. 5 
Loyola Marymount University 
with last year’s close loss to the 
Lions still fresh on their minds.

UCSD won two out of its 
four games at the Northern 
California Tournament at 
Stanford University Sept. 19 
and Sept, including a 6-5 loss to 
LMU in the opening match. 

Falling behind 5-2 after 
three quarters against the 
Lions, UCSD scored three goals 
in the fourth period, but was 
unable to overcome the early 
hole.

The Tritons bounced back 
with an 8-7 win over No. 10 
Concordia University, then 
split their Sunday games, fall-
ing to No. 9 Cal State Long 
Beach before rebounding to 
beat No. 18 UC Davis. 

Prior to the tournament at 
Stanford, the Tritons traveled 
to Maryland for three matches 
on Sept. 11 and Sept. 12. In a 
classic matchup of West Coast 
versus East Coast, the Tritons 
performed well, posting back-
to-back wins over George 
Washington University and 
John Hopkins University before 
dropping a hard-fought, 11-10 
overtime decision to the Naval 
Academy.

“In the games against 
George Washington and Johns 
Hopkins, our conditioning 
played the overall factor on 
both defense and offense,” Cruz

MEN’S GOLF

After a solid summer of 
amateur tournaments, the UCSD 
men’s golf team will begin its 
fall season on Sept. 28 and Sept. 
29 at the Western Washington 
Invitational.

The Tritons return with 
their top two golfers from last 
season. Junior Keith Okasaki 
will take over captain duties and 
claims the number one spot on 
the roster, after leading UCSD 
last season with a 33rd-place 
finish at the NCAA Central/
West Regional and a 74.2 stroke 
average.

Coming off a successful 2008 
seasons the UCSD cross country 
team jumped back into action 
earlier this month to start the 
new campaign. Last year, the 
Tritons came close to seizing 
both conference crowns, but the 
men’s and women’s teams both 
found themselves beat out by 
Chico State. This season, the 
Tritons are hoping for better 
results.

“Both teams have a goal of 
remaining in the top three teams 
of the conference,” head coach 
Nate Garcia said. “Last season, 
the men placed second in con-
ference and the women placed 
third. At the very least, we want 
to hold our position. Each year is 
a little bit different, but we want 
to stay in the top three and work 

from there.”
Leading off the new season 

at home, the Tritons swept the 
UCSD Opener on Aug. 29. On 
the women’s side, sophomore Bre 
Schofield continued last year’s 
trend by winning her first race of 
the year, this time beating out all 
competition in the 2.5-mile race. 

The Triton women recorded 
faster times than their oppo-
nents from Point Loma Nazarene 
University, San Diego Christian 
College, Sonoma State University 
and Cerritos College for the win.

Although the UCSD men 
did not field the top individual 
winner, the Triton harriers took 
five of the top six spots, with 
freshman Brian Knight leading 
the way. Knight’s time of 22:52.7 
was just three seconds behind 
first-place Jason Zapien from
