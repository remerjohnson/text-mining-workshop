Woods speaks out 
against apartheid 
By SUSIE BEEL 
Alts Editor 

In January of 1978, journal-
ist Donald Woods and his fam-
ily were forced to flee from 
their home in South Africa . 
Woods had been banned by the 
South African government for 
publishing the details sur-
rounding the death of his friend, 
Stephen Biko. 

In re pon e to his banning, 
Woods began impulsively to 
work on the book Biko. Wood 
had to leave South Africa in 
order to publish the book , 
which chronicle the beliefs as 
well as the imprison ment and 
death of Biko. Upon arrival in 
London, Woods began a new 
career - that ofha ling South 
African embassie and coun-
terracting his nati e govern-
ment's propaganda so that the 
truth of apartheid would 
hecome known to the world . 

\ ood ha been coming to 
the Untted States for nine year, 
giving udience a first-hand 
account of life in South Africa, 
urging dive ttnent and that 
other economic sanctions be 
implemented against his native 
country. Speaking to a packed 
audience in Mandell Weis 
Theatre last Friday night (the 
ame night that the movie "Cry 

Freedom" coincidentally 
opened in San Diego), Woods 
outlined the reasons why he 
believes that divestment is vital 

to avoiding violence in South 
Africa' future. 

Wood see the reign of the 
Afrikaaner Nationalists lowly 
unraveling. "The only hope of 
saving a terrible escalation of 
violence in South Africa , is to 
twist the arm of the govern-
ment economically, until they 
negotiate ... because that's what 
they're going to have to do 
anyway one day, and we've got 
to get [it] out of their minds 
that they are going to have 
allies if they want to shoot it 
out." 

Woods expounded on the 
lunacy and horror of apartheid 
throughout the eveni ng, 
de cribing the South African 
government's meticulou 
implementation of 317 racial 
laws, as well as their expan ive 
propaganda campaign. He gave 
example of the lunacy of these 
racial laws - one which tate 
that black are allo d to 
hammer a nail i with the front 
of a hammer, but are not 
allowed to remove it due to a 
concept of the latter as more 
complicated. He also citec1 the 
Factories Act whi h specifie 
that for every 15 workers, or 
part thereof, of either sex or 
any race-group (there are four 
race groups in South Africa : 
white , black, colored and 
Indian) there had to be a separ-
ate toilet. "Toilets loom large in

Donald Woods, author of a.ko and subject of the recently 
released film "Cry Freedom," met with the press on his arrival at 
the San Diego airport last Friday. Later that evening he delivered 
an inspired lecture to a crowded house at UCSD's Mandell 
Weiss Theatre. 

Failure predicted more surely than success 

Teachers discuss diagnostic tests 
By CHRIS HAMSON 
Stll// Writer 

UCSD hosted a conference 
for San Diego County high 
school mathematics teachers to 
discuss the Mathematics Diag-
nostic Testing Project (M DTP), 
a competency-testing program 
that evaluates student readiness 
for college mathematics. 

The Feb. 18 conference focused 
on the relationship between 
diagnostic testing and the cur-
riculum of high school and jun-
ior high school mathematics 
classes. 

"The test predict failure more 
accurately than they predict suc-
cess," said Dr. Philip Curtis, 
M DTP chairman and UCLA 
mathematics professor. "When 
putting together these tests, we 
search for pivotal questions. 
Students who fail to handle these 
questions will fail to succeed at 

the next level. However, student 
who can answer the questions do 
not always go on to succeed." 

A joint project of the UC and 
California State University sys-
tems, the M DTP tested more 
than 260,000 California high 
school and junior high school 
students last year. 

In the San Diego area 27,000 
tests were scored last year by the 
MDTP. Richard Pilgrim of 
UCSD is director of the MDTP 
of San Diego and spoke at the 
conference about "Interpreting 
the M DTP Summary Results ." 

Five diagnostic tests are avail-
able from the MDTP, including 
a new elementary algebra diag-
nostic test. "Comments from high 
school teachers who used the 
tests, as well as observations by 
the workgroup, stimulated 
development of another te t, 
called the elementary algebra 

diagnostic test, to determine 
readiness for second year alge-
bra," said Alfred Manaster , 
adminstrative coordinator for the 
MDTP and a UCSD professor 
of mathematics. 

The other tests include two 
pre-calculus tests, an inter-
mediate algebra test, and a pre-
algebra test. There is no charge 
within the state of California for 
either scoring or testing mate-
rials, except for community 
colleges . 

Each student taking an M DTP 
test receives an analysis indicat-
ing areas of strength and wea-
kness from a elected set of criti-
cal skill areas . rhe teacher 
receives a class summary which 
may indicate the extent to which 
CSU and UC tandard are being 
met. 

The MDTP wa formed in 
1977 a mathematic faculty from 

SU and UC campu e joined

Will staying out of debt 
affect the poor? 

• Stephen J. Gould 
Noted scientist gives 
art a fair shake 

together to develop competency 
tests to assess student readiness 
for college level calculus. By the 
early 1980s the group had devised 
two tests: a pre-calculus diagnos-
tic test and an intermediate alge-
bra test. Both were field-tested 
on several UC and CSU cam-
puses and were adopted for 
counseling and placement uses 
on various campuses within both 
system . 

Word of the tests spread to 
mathematics teachers in high 
schools and the tests were made 
available te them as well. 

At the conference held in the 
Basic Science Building, Curtis 
said that the M DTP tests "were 
not designed for class program 
evaluation," but that the tests 
could be part of a more compre-
hensive class evaluation system. 
"Con istent errors show flaws in 
a tudent's mathematical back-
ground." Curtis aid . [0

campuses 
may be 
needed 

30 percent 
enrollment 
growth is 
projected 

By LARRY GORDON 
Special/10m the Los Angeles Times 

SAN FRA CISCO - Facing 
a projected enrollment boom for 
the next 20 year, the Univer ity 
of California probably has to 
build a 10th campu , or even an 
11th or 12th, UC officials said 
Thursday. 

"We are beginning to plan 
how to plan for another campus," 
William Baker, UC vice pre ident 
In charge of budget and university 
relations, aid at a meeting ofthe 
Board of Regents. 

Without more cIa srooms and 
dormitories, official said, the 
sy tern may have to abandon it 
tradition of admitting al\ eligible 
California high school students 
- tbose in the top 12.5% aca-
demically. "Jt's been increasingly 
difficult to fulfill that commit-
ment,"said William Frazer, UC' 
senior vice president of academic 
affairs . 

Spurred by the university's 
good reputation and relatively 
low fees, enrollment has grown 
over the last 10 years, even though 
the number of college-age stud-
ents has dropped, both in Calif-
ornia and nationwide. 

Officials project that the cur-
rent enrollment of 155,000 may 
grow to 200,000 within two 
decades because of the so-called 
"echo boom" effect - in which 
children of baby boomers will 
reach college age - and an in-
creased presence of Asian and 
Latino immigrants. 

The university would like to 
expand facilities at some of its 
existing nine campuses. However, 
such attempts are likely to pro-
voke opposition from surround-
ing communities that already 
complain about problems -
from traffic to housing - caused 
by the schools. 

"From what I read, the only 
community that would welcome 
growth i Riverside," aid Yori 
Wada, a regent from San 
Francisco. 

"And Fresno," quickly added 
Frank W. Clark Jr. , chairman of 
the Board of Regent . He was

Arms treaty: It's a START 
By LETICIA VII.LARREAL 
Staff Writer 

The Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty (ST ART) talks substituted 
for "Perestroika" as the topic at 
last Wednesday's UCSD faculty 
luncheon / seminar when director 
of the I nstitute on Global Conflict 
and Cooperation Herbert York 
filled in for scheduled speaker 
Tair Tairnov, director of the 
Soviet Union's Institute of World 
and International Relations . 

Tairnov cancelled his appear-
ance three days before the event, 
but has been rescheduled for 
another luncheon to be held on 
March 14at Muir College's north 
dining room, with seating limited 
to the first 75 people. 

York's impromptu discourse 
dealt with the "major problems" 
in the START talks between the 
United States and the Soviet 
Union, and the prospects for 
their resolution . York called 

these talks a continuation of the 
Strategic Arms Limitations 
Treaty (SALT) talks, and said 
that the name for the new round 
of negotiations was chosen to 
emphasize that the participants 
were now "seriously interested" 
in arms reductions as opposed to 
the arms limitation goal of the 
SA L T -negotiations. 

When President Reagan and 
Mikhail Gorbachev met in Wash-
ington, D.C. , to sign the Inter-
mediate Nuclear Forces ( I F) 
treaty, York recalled that they 
made "a number of statements 
concerning future plans ... and, 
in an official communique, they 
provided an outline for the 
remainder of the START nego-
tiations. " 

"The basic purpose of the 
START negotiations is to pro-
duce a treaty which would ac-
tually reduce strategic arms ," 
York stated. " And the objective 
is to accomplish this treaty in 
time for the next summit meet-
ing, which probably will be in 
Mayor June. That's an extremely 
difficulty objective - it's a very 
short time." 

Other difficulties include the 
disagreement between the super-
powers on interpretation of the 
1972 Anti-BaHistic Missile treaty, 
and Soviet opposition to the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. "On 
top of everything else," York 
added, "there is a very powerful 
action within the United States' 
political community, between the 
ratification process for INF and 
the negotiation process for 
START, which makes this very 
much more difficult than it would 
be anyway." 

Regents plan for new campus 

Although the I NF treaty calls 
for the elimination of an entire 
class of nuclear weapons, this 
class includes only ground-based 
missiles with ranges between 300 
and 3,500 miles , which amount 
to less than four percent of the 
two countries' total nuclear ar-
senals . START, in contrast, 
involves negotiating 'deep cuts' 
in the superpower stockpiles of 
the more destructive, strategic 
missiles that both sides presently 
possess. 

The stated objective for 
START is to reduce strategic 
arms by 50 percent, or what the 
negotiators refer to as 'deep cuts .' 
"That is not actually a working 
figure ," York stressed . "The fig-
ures that are being negotiated 
are a certain ceiling and soml'" Conlinued from page 1 

ing by Fresno-area officials to 
get a campus built there. 

UC President David P . 
Gardner said he expected to 
pre ent more detailed informa-
tion about ways to handle enroll-
ment growth at the October meet-
ing of the regents. At a press 
conference after Thursday's meet-
ing, Gardner said it would take 
between six and eight years to 
build a new campus once the 
regents approved suc h a decision 
and the state agreed to pay for it. 
He aid the cost would depend 
on many variables, including loca-
tion and whether the campus 
would include both undergradu-
ate and graduate tudies. 

The regents met Thursday in a 
non-voting session to discuss the 
complicated ' and controversial 
issue of undergraduate admis-
sions. Competition has become 
increasingly fierce at the most 
popular UC campu es, praticu-
larty UC Berkeley and UC LA, 
and more and more UC-eliglble 
students complain about being 
rejected at their first-choice cam-
pus. 

If the commitment to admit all 
eligible students is dropped, mi-
nority and low-income students 
might suffer the mo t, several 
regen ts and guest speakers said. 
Asian-American activists have 
claimed that the UC system ha 
unfairly limited the number of 
Asian students admitted as fresh-
men , an allegation the university 
denies. 

In a separate action, the re-
gents approved Gardner's choice 

of John H . uckolls as the new 
director of the Lawrence Liver-
more National Laboratory, one 
of the nation's two nuclear wea-
pons research centers. UC man-
ages the laboratory for the U.S . 
Department of Energy. uckolls 
currently heads the laboratory 's 
physics department, which has 
worked on the controversial Stra-
tegic Defense Initiative space-
based laser program. He will 
become lab director in April, 
succeedi ng Roger Batzel , who 
has held the post since 1971. 

The lab, in Alameda County 
on the outskirts of Livermore, 
has 8,250 employees and an an-
nllal research budget of more 
that $850 million. 

The regents' decision to pro-
mote Nuckolls was made behind 
closed doors, but Gardner later 
said that there was no dissent 
among the ·members. Gardner. 
however , acknowledged that

Poorest Will Pay 
The UCSD Medical Center i a profit center as 

well, it turn out. 
After operating in the black for several years, the 

hospital finds itself running a first-half deficit of 
$2. 1 million . That's $2. 1 million out of a total 
budget of $260 million. If the federal government 
was doing that well, there'd be dancing in the street , 
or at least in the corridors of our Economics 
department. 

The hospital, however , is worried . Fifty-three 
percent of their patient aren't "ad equately covered" 
by insurance or state health program like Medi-
Cal. Manyofthesepeopleareindigent. Theho pita l 
pla ns to stop treating some of those people to get 
back in black . 

"No longer can we continue to bear this burden of 
undercompensating patients," hospital Executive 
Director Michael Stringer aid in announcing new 
ho pital policy. 

ome of the changes: 
• Requiring 50 percent depo its before medical 

care is given to so me; 
• Denying care to ome trauma and emergency 

patients (If they "loo k poor," perhaps?); 
• Re erving some bed for private patient ,leaving 

them unused by poorer patients even if unfilled . 
Further. the ho pital plan to market itself more 
consciously to the upscale ill. 

All these change involve shifti ng the financial 
burden to the poor. already the victims of the wor t 
health care of any major "first world" country. 

omehow we doubt that the e policy changes are 
temporary. We think the hospital will use the short-
te rm deficit to cut off services to ma n of the 
county's poorer citizen who don't conveniently fit 
Into their admini trative plans. 

It's wrong and Chancellor Atkinson should stop 
it before it becomes entrenched policy. At stake is a 
j ust and compa ionate Univer ity of California 
approach to medicine. 

CIA in Residence 
George Chritton. Jr. may be the first UC faculty 

member let go in the name of academic freedom. 
Chritton is a lecturer at UC Santa Barbara , on 

loan from his employer. The arrangement that 
brought him to campus ha cau ed demonstrations, 
and student and faculty debate over the nature of 
academic-government relation . 

What's excited so much comment up there in 
Goleta is the identity of his employer - the Central 
Intelligence Agency. 

Chritton's at UCSB as part of a CIA Officer-in-
Residence program. The agency maintains the right 
ll) censor what Chritton, an active CIA official , can 
say. That doesn't fit the UC Academic enate vision 
of a "free exchange of idea ." Nor, a UCSB com-
mittee t hinks , should the CIA be allowed a voice in 
who i~ hired for that job. That's an infringement of 
the university'S freedom to hire and fire independent 
of business or government pre sure. 

eparation from the CI A is an especially ensitive 
academic issue considering tl.e CIA use of Sociology 
and Anthropology professors as foreign operatives. 

The UCSB e nate has recommended the termi-
natIon of the cr A program. We concur, and suggest 
that the UCSB, UC D, and other UC Academic 
Senate bodies carry the recommendation to it 
logica l conclusion and ban campus facult y from 
working fo r the CIA .

Med Center 
Cuts Awful 

Editor: 
I have ju t read with alarm the 

proposed cuts in health care pro-
po ed at the UCS D Medical Center 
[Guardian, Feb. 16]. 

These propo ed cu ts are outrage-
ous. That people should be reduced 
to the level of dollars and cents is 
appalling. Medical health care is a 
fundamental human rights . All peo-
ple are entitled to quality health care 
with equal care and dignity regard-
less of their economic background . 
The propo ed financial health care 
cherne propo ed by the UCSD 

Medical Center smacks of economic 
discrimination. not to mention of 
cou rse that many poor people can-
not afford health insurance. 

This financial back stabbing of the 
people of San Diego County will 
directly affect the tudent body of 
UC D. Any student here at campus 
who is without insurance or who is 
not covered by their parent' in u-
ranee and is in some so rt of traffic 
accident will be shuttled to different 
hospital in pain and misery while 
pri va te hospital physicians decide to 
what extent to treat their patient. 
This happens frequently in the Los 
Angeles County hospital sys tem. 

I urge a ll students to protest this ill 
thought out plan. Health care is not 
a privilege but a fundamental human 
right.

Services for 
Women 

Editor: 
The point s raised by PatriCia 

Demory in her letter [Guardian , Feb. 
16] are well founded: however, it is 
important for student to know that 
the UCSD Student Safety Aware-
ness Program. housed in the Student 

enter, Bldg. B, provides assistance 
and information for students that 
are a part of the service offered by 
Women 's Resource Center's at other 

C campuses . 
The CSD Student Safety 

Awareness Progra m offers ra pe 
prevention education including sex-
ual a ault and "da te rape," informa-
tion on a ailable recourse for sexual

I would appreciate you r assistance 
in helping us to inform students of 
the Student Safety Awareness Pro-
gram so that it can better respond to 
their needs and concerns.

Sex and 
Race Bias 

Editor: 
I'm writing in regards to your Feb . 

8 "new shorts" announceme nt 
entitled "UC Da vi to hold summer 
research program ." This announce-
ment said, "Wh ile SUAA RP is open 
to all qualified stud ent , it is primar-
ily intended for minorities, women 
and other disadvantaged students 
who have co mpleted their junior 
year in college." 

Clearly. this excerpt is in inuating 
that minorites and female students 
are "disad antaged." I'm a female 

st udent and I certainly don't per-
ceive myself as being disadvantaged 
in any way whatsoever. This excerpt 
is predicated upon the d istasteful 
generalization that to be a minority 
or a woman student is to be 
"disadvantaged . " 

Fra nkly, rm quite surprised that 
the Guardian would print such a 
biased and sexist co mment. The 
Universit y of California i an institu-
tion which educates its students, 
faculty, and staff on the evils of sex-
ism and discrimination , yet the Uni-
versi ty of California obviously 
doesn't practice what it preaches. 

I bel ieve that a prompt a pology 
hould be forthcom ing to all the 

minorities and women who have 
been in ulted by this announceme nt.

Comm Department Abuses 
Students in Reg Process 

Editor S not~: The .name of the writn of this commentary has been 
withheld by request. 

On Feb. II , I had a midterm. That doesn't set me apan from anyone 
else here - most intelligent people realize that the middle of the 
quarter brings such things. However. on this day all seniors who are 
graduating in communications in June, like me, were expected, with-
out adequate notice, to somehow place all ot her concerns in a state of 
suspended animation and come to the great Comm. office to queue up 
at the hallowed feet of Mr. Greg Griffin. After all, his office hours 
started at I pm, the same time as my midterm. 

Let me explain. As a graduating senior, I must take a integrative 
seminar (Comm 150) this coming quarter. It is the last of the require-

ment~ for the major, and if I somehow don't get into this class, I can't 
graduate. Now, you may ask why this was a concern on the 11th, onc 
full week before pre-enrollment. This is a valid question, and the 
answer is because this is the comm deplnment. To us majors, this is 
self-explanatory. 

You see, it was decided somewhere along the line that, despite 
printed notices saying we should see Greg Griffin "sometime before the 
17th," he would stan signing students into integrative seminars in his 
office hours on Thursday, the 11th. Notices were sent out over the 
computer mail system. and only some communication students have 
acco unt s. The only other way to find out wa by word of mouth. (This 
is a department of communication?) With only the three Comm 150 
classes, each consisti ng of 25 people, spaces in the classes disa ppear 
instantaneously. Thus, those of us who went to ou r classes were told 
one thing in response to getting there later: tough. Ditch the class or, 
in my case, ditch the midterm. What a marvelous way to promote 
education. 

Thi ounds utterly ridiculous, malOly because it is . But no one I 
talked to in line sounded urrnsed: comm students arc used to such 
treatment. rhls I, the wa} the wonderful comm departme"', operatn

START 
Continued from page 3 
ce ilings .... in particular, the 
goals, a rc 10 reduce warheads in 
thc stra tegic forces to 6,000 war-
head and to red uce the number 
of st rategic nu clear delivery ve-
hicles to 1,600." 

When asked if those figures 
had been agreed on by both 
countries, York said yes, main-
taining that they were part of a 
"separate communique which is 
a public document." 

York believes that, despite the 
previously-mentioned difficulties 
in the START negotiation pro-
cess. there is a good chance both 
sides will come to some sort of 
agreement before the next 
summit. 

The reason Yorkjustifies using 
'cautious optimism ' over the 
chances of having an agreement 
over the reduction of stra tegic 
nuclear forces by that time, is the 
viability of a 50 percent reduc-
tion that does not put eithe r side 
at a serious disadvantage . 

"In t he first place," York 
argued, "the number of strategic 
nuclear delivery vehicles now em-
ployed in the Soviet Un ion is 
about 2,400. So a reduction to 
1.600 would be a reduction by 
about one third. r n case of the 
American strategic arsenal , the 
number of strategic nuclear de-
livery vehicles now employed is 
about 2,000; so a reduction from 
2,000 to 1,600 is a reduction by 
20 percent." 

However, noting that there is 
even disagreement over the exact 
number of warheads now em-
ployed on each side, he conceded 
that reducing the total number 
of warheads would be a "much 
more complicated matter." [Q] 

Comm 
Continued from pag~ 4 
Every quarter we gleefully sit in 
line for hours on the first day of 
pre-enrollment , solemnly lusting 
after that elu ive department 
stamp. If there are any classes 
you have to take, you had better 
get there no later than 4:30 am. 
At least this quarter, we figured , I 
the seniors could enroll by tele-
phone. Likely story. ow we are 
told that because we are comm 
majors , "our computers don't 
interface with the registrar's -
gotta wait in line again." Keep in 
mind that by the time most of us 
make it to the front of the line, 
it's already 9 or 10 am, and we've 
missed classes . 

This situation is all the more 
frustrating in light of the fact 
that the faculty teaching in the 
department are, on the whole, 
tremendously talented, caring. 
interesting people . The curricu-
lum gives students an extremely 
well-rounded education in many 
different areas . It is a much more 
stimulating major than would be 
indicated by the derogatory 
treatment it has received on 
campus. Contrary to what some 
people say. it is not a "blow-off" 
major, a haven for airheads and 
rich brats . Most of the professors 
legitimately give a damn about 
their students and how much 
they learn, which can't be said 
for a lot of other majors at 
UCSD. 

I'm afraid that until the com-
munications department learns 
to employ some semblance 01 
organization, it is destined to 
lose many potentially excellent 
students who decide that the 
merits of t he classes offered are 
not worth the trouble of putting 
up with thi infantile idiocy just 
to get into them.

Gould makes an 
art out of science 
By MICHELE BIDWELL 
Corrtributing Fraturl's Editor 

I n the field of science, there are some researchers who are able to make the crossover from a respected positio'n in a small and exclusive professional arena to acclaim and recogni-
tion among the general public. Stephen Jay Gould is one of those 
people. 

As a noted scientist, lecturer, and educator, Gould's studies of 
evolutionary biology have been made available to a wide audience 
in various books including Hen's Teeth and Horse s Toes. The 
Flamingo s Smile, and his latest book, An Urchin in the Storm. 
His essays have also been published in several magazines includ-
ing his own monthly column in Nalural Hislory. 

Gould's theories have many facets, some of which he addressed 
in a lecture at UCSD last Thursday, which was sponsored by the 
department of literature. The major theme of Gould's discussion 
was taxonomy - the study of general principle of scientific clas i-
fication . Gould argued that "taxonomy is the best way of classify-
ing object" but that "the perspective of the taxonomist [is] arbi-
trary" and that the classification of objects is not as clear-cut as it 
may seem. 

To prove this, Gould gave various historical examples of the 
way in which science and literature and art are interrelated. 
Because of this, the process of taxonomy is based on interdiscipli-
nary influences, Gould said .

Libraries get comQuterized 

Moving into the express lane 
By MILES KAN 

taff Writer 

UCSD one of the nation's 
top science and engineering 
schools, the campus of the inven-
tion of the CSD Pa cal com pu-
ter language, and home of the 
world famous upercomputer; 
yet UCSD doesn't even have a 
computerized li brary check-out 
system. As most students should 
know by now, checking out books 
from the library is a long pro-
ce s. One must fill o ut a epllrate 
card with the sa me information 
for each book being checked out. 
Many colleges and even com-
munity libraries have computer-
ized systems - so what's taking 
UCSD so long? 

" It 's a long and complicated 
process," University Librarian 
Dorothy Gregor said. According 
to Gregor, UCSD has been plan-
ning a computerized check-out 
system since 1980. Unfortunately, 
the first computer company that 
the university selected to do bus-
iness with went bankrupt, and 

Ken Relnslelr./ Guardian 
Th. h •• v, lo.d - The archaic system of checking out books at 
UCSD can cause severe writer's cramp. Borrowing books seems to 
take longer than actually reading them. 

For example, Gould stated that "science always uses pictures" 
and while showing slides, he discussed several scientists, such as 
Ernst Haeckel, Albert Thayer, and Nicolas Steno, who had fused 
their scientific theories with art and literature to illustrate their 
views. 

In discussing these scientists, Gould not only defended their 
often-ridiculed theories on the basis of their reasonable deduc-
tions but also went on to argue that these theories, which do merge 
scie nce with art and literature, influence modern scientific taxo-
nomical principles . 

Gould argued that we must "scrutinize disciplinary boundaries 
[and] see taxonomy as a reformative force"which is influenced by 
all disciplines. 

"Nothing but habit and traditions separate the two cultures of 
the humanities and the sciences ," Gould concluded. "The pro-
cesses of thought and modes of reason are similar ... only subject 
matter differentiates the two." 

Gould's ini tial claim-to-fame has been attributed to his theory 
on "punctuated equilibrium"which he co-developed with another 
evolutionary biologist, Nils Eldredge. This theory argues against 
the traditional idea that natural selection occurs over large 
tretches of time but rather, Gould argued, genetic mutations

Although not officially ordered 
yet, the new computer system 
will be contracted with Innova-
tive Interfaces, a Berkeley-based 
company. UCSD already uses 
an Innovative Interfaces system 
for ordering books and journals. 
According to Gregor, a contract 
for the computerized check-out 
system will be signed next week . 

The new system is planned to 
be operative as of fall , 1988. 
Gregor said it will take, "less 
than a second," to check out a 
book. A student'S identification 
card will be read with a "light

Woods speaks against apartheid, for freedom 
Continued from page I 
the apa rtheid mentalit}."Woods 
said. 

In 1984 a reform movement by 
the government of outh Africa 
repealed seven of the 317 racial 
laws because it was becoming 
increasi ngly hard to defend their 
racist policie to foreign embas-
sies. "But what black South 
Africans say [i ] never mind the 
3171aws, we're only interested in 
one. That's the one that forbids 
us to vote in our own country." 

The refu al by the government 
to let the blacks vote is one of the 
many contradictions that exist in 
the policy of the South African 
government. Woods add ressed 
some of the common arguments 
made against imposing economic 
sanctions. For example, accord-
ing to the South African govern-
ment, there is widespread " black-

not rule themselves or the coun-
try, as they would not be able to 
unite and elect one leader. The 
fact that tribalism is relatively 
nonexistent in politics is realized 
by the South African govern-
ment. The violence that occurs is 
between white troops and blacks . 
The government uses the vio-
lence as a propaganda tool , and 
reports it as black-on-black VIO-
lence. 

Another claim which Woods 
attributes to government propa-
ganda is that black resistance to 
a partheid i communist-led and 
inspired . The African National 
Congre s (ANC) has had an 
alliance with the South African 
Communist Party, but, Woods 
said, "if that makes them com-
munists, then President Roose-
velt and the entire United States 
and all the British and the French 
in World War II must have been 

Currently in the United Nations, only two 
countries are vetoing a security council reso-
lution which calls for total economic sanc-
tions of South Africa. Those countries are the 
United States and Great Britain. 

on-black" violence as warring 
tribes fight amongst themselves. 
Woods claimed that if this were 
true, the government would not 
resist the idea of "one-man one-
vote." 

The vote, in effect, would show 
the world that the' blacks could 

communists for having an alli-
ance with the Soviet Union." 

People in the United States 
have incorrectly believed that 
South Africa is the only place to 
get precious alloys, such as pla-
tinum and manganese. This, 
according to Woods, is another 

piece of propaganda. There ar~ 
large deposits of these metals in 
places uch as Brazil and Austra-
lia, he said. 

Finally, it has been argued 
that divestment would hurt the 
blacks more than the whites. 
Proponents of this argument 
urge gradual reform . He len 
SU7man, who spoke at UCSD 
last quarter as part of the same 
Helen Edison lecture series is 
one proponent of gradual re -
form . Wood s quoted Biko as a 
reply to this claim: " It is always 
the non-victims of o ppression 
who urge gradual reform, not 
the victi ms." 

In order to find out what thc 
majority of black South Afri-
ca ns want, Woods offered his 
"Lech Walesa test." "Any coun-
try like Poland or the Soviet 
Union or South Africa , which 
refuses to let its people vote, we 
are entitled to assume that the 
legitimate representative leaders 
of the people are those who are 
most persecuted, most locked 
up, most harassed by the state. 
And in Poland that's Lech 
Walesa, and in South Africa 
that's Mandella." 

Tribal chief Buthelezi has 
claimed at times to represent the 
blacks, supporting issues of gra-
dual reform. Woods questioned 
the legitimacy of the claims of 
Buthelezi and his role as a 
spokesman for blacks in South 
Africa, pointing out that his 
salary is paid by the government. 

It is unclear what is currently 
happening in South Africa , for , 
as Woods said, the government 

Woods discussed what he termed the lunacy and horror of apar-
theid . and urged for economic sanctions against South Africa. 

is heavily ce nsoring the foreign 
press . With scenes of violence in 
South Africa gone from the even-
ing news, the tendency to forget 
about the country is great. 
Woods hopes that with the 
release of "Cry Freedom," the 
issues will once again stir the 
conscious of the American peo-
ple, as well as those around the 
world . Currently in the United 
Nations, only two countries are 
vetoing a security council resolu-
tion which calls for total eco-
nomic sanctions of South Africa. 
Those countries are the United 
States and Great Britain . If "Cry 
Freedom"can help people under-
stand more clearly what apar-
theid stands for, Woods hopes 
that pressures will increase on 
both governments to adopt eco-
nomic sanctions. 

A well-informed audience 
asked Woods numerou ques-
tions toward the lecture's end, 
and Woods see med very willing 
to stay until he had answered 
them all. When questioned on 
the accuracy of the film, Woods , 
who served as a major consul-
tant , was adamant in verifying 
the film as completely factual. 
He praised Denzel Washington's 
portrayal of Biko, adding that 
even Biko's closest friends 
thought the likeness was striking. 

Although the censorship board 
in South Africa did not ban the 
movie , Woods aid he did not 
believe the movie would ever be 
shown there. The whites in South 
Africa are isolated from what is 
going on ; to let this movie be 
shown would be to bring the

At present, many things need 
to be done before the new com-

example, the library has to make 
room for the new system. " We

Also, records mu t be sent out to

By JEFF LAMBETH 

First-year UCSD women's 
softball coaches Lin Adams and 
Lisa Bas i are hoping their early 
eason fears were unfounded. 

In the first few games of the 
season, Adams and Bassi were 
worried about a lack of offensive 
production. 

Those worries were at least 
partially allied by Saturday's 
doubleheader against Di vision I 
school Loyola Marymount Uni-
versity. In the two games held at 
the La Jolla Jewish Community 
Center, the Tritons cruised to 12-
2 and 9-0 wins . 

"We swung the bat pretty 
well," Adams said . "We weren't 
hitting very ~ell at first this sea-
son. I just hope we can keep it 
going. " 

AAB 

The Tritons (4-2) collected 12 
hits in the first game. Four Trit-
o ns had multiple-hit games. 

Stacie Sasaki was 2-for-4 with 
two RBis . Dana Chaike n fin-
is hed 2-for-3 and scored three 
ru ns. 

The Lions got to Hurtt o nce, 
when rightfie lder Ca rol yn Bal-
divez hit a home run . "(he Trit-
ons already had the game well in 
hand . however. 

In the second game, the Lions 
picked up nine hits while UCS D 
only managed five, but two dou-
ble plays by the Tritons and con-
trol problems by the Lion pitcher 
preserved the shutout. It was the 
second shutout of the year for 
Triton pitcher Sasaki (2- J). 

The Tritons will get a strong 
test this Friday a nd Saturday, 

when they face La Verne and Cal 
State San Bernardino. 

Michelle Mundee, Hu rtt, Tra-
cey Kehr , Callabresi, Julie War-
tell and Dani Goodlett each had 
a hit to propel the Tritons to 
victory. 

The Tritons played exceptional 
defense in both games. 

"We only had one error in 14 
innings," Adams said . "That isn 'l 
bad. " 

Last year the team fo ught to 
altain a .500 record . The goal the 
rookie co-head coaches have set 
~o r the team this year is to qual-
Ify for the NCAA Divisio n III 
regionals. 

And if they can maintain their 
defense and pitching, plus hit the 
way they did against the Lions, 
that goal is in reach . [0

Tritons finish at 18-9 
By BRIAN ITOW 
S I"II Wriler 

The big experiment is over .. .. and 
the Tritons aren't much worse for the 
wear. At the beginning of the seaso n, 
coach Tom Marshall knew he faced a 
difficult task in replacing four starters 
from last year's 18-7 squad - including 
leading scorers Brian Backens, Greg 
Kamansky and John Saintgnon. So, he 
brought in a number of junior transfer 
and freshmen recruits and attempted to 
blend them together with this returning 
players to match the team's record from 
a year ago. 

They almost did it. But a loss Friday 
night at Menlo College left them just 
short of the mark. The game was the 
first meeting between the two schools 
since their brawl a month ago and they 
both came out very tight , not knowing 
what to expect . What they ended up 
getting was a very sloppy game with 
both teams making numerous mistakes 
and neither team taking control. 

UCSD led early in the game by as 
many as seven points, but could not 
hold it as Menlo College fought back to 
take the lead . They would have taken a 
three point lead into the locker room at 
halftime but junior guard Rob Rittgers 
hit a 25-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the 
game. The second half was a mirror of 
the first. The two teams exchanged 
leads but neither could assume control. 
But, when the final buzzer sounded, 
Menlo had a 74-68 advantage and 
escaped with a victory. 

The Tritons followed their loss with 
a n easy victory over the College of 
Notre Dame, 79-66. The victory gave 
the Tritons a 17-9 record for the season 

- the third best in UCSD history. In 
the game, Marshall was able to clear his 
bench, giving everyone an opportunity 
to play, allowing the coach to look to 
the future. 

" We ended the season at 17-9," Mar-
shall stated, "That's not bad for a young 
team . We brought in a lot of good kids 
this year and they matured during the 
season. In the next couple of years we 
should be very strong again ." 

The Tritons very well could be, but 
they need to replace two key players 
from this year's squad . Center And y 
Jedynak and forward Kevin Stewart 
played their final games in Triton uni-
forms this weekend and showed what 
the team would have to replace. Both 
players turning in impressive perfor-
mances over the weekend (Jedynak had 
13 points, 12 rebounds vs. Menlo, and 
Stewart had 22 points vs . Notre Dame.) 
and their services will be missed in the 
upcoming season. 

Marshall commented, "The loss of 
Stewart and Jedynak is significant but 
we can compensate. Freshman point 
guard Greg Paskwietz has come a long 
way this season . Also, our big men Nick 
Capuano and Andy Wagstaff have con-
tinued to develop this year. Their con-
tinued development will be the key to 
our improvement as a team ." 

" I think we're on the verge of a 20-win 
season. With the continued develop-
ment of our freshmen and sophomores 
and another good recruiting class, I 
think we can get it. There was only a one 
game difference between this year's 
squad and last year 's - and we did it 
with mostly new players. Right now, 
I'm looking positively to the future . " [0
