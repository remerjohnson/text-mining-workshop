The Guardian 
Becomes a 
Daily Paper 

This newspaper begins daily 
publication today. 

Appropriately enough, the 
paper is now called The Daily 
Guardian. 

Through this week and again 
next year, you will be able to 
look for five new papers per 
week with expanded campus 
and community news and more 
new features . 

We are expanding for several 
reasons. 

At the beginning of this year, 
we said that this newspaper 
would be changing, getting' 
better. In some way we 've lived 
up to that pledge. We have 
increased the number of pages 
by fifty percent, added features 
like the AP news page, Oliphant 
and the movie guide and in at 
least a few cases offered 
complete and perceptive 
reporting, while continuing to 
operate with minimal student 
subsidy. 

As we see it, though, we have 
been deficient in several key 
areas, including coverage of 
minority affairs, broader 
campus trends and adminis-
trative manipulations. 

Next year we will be trying to 
improve our coverage in these 
areas especially, but in all othef 
areas as well. 

This week of daily 
publication is in many ways just 
a run through for next year. We 
are testing our system for minor 
flaws and major oversights. If 
you see a few mistakes this 
week, don't be too surprised. 
We will be working over the 
summer nailing everything 
down. 

As there are only about sixty 
of us at The Daily Guardian

Fretter, UC VP, 
'Concerned~ About 
McElroy Crisis 

Interviews Over 30 Profs While 
Here; Saxon Coming Wednesday 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
News Editor 

UC Systemwide Administration, "very concerned" over the 
administrative crisis which is threatening the job of Chancellor 
William McElroy, sent Vice President William Fretter, the second 
ranking official in the university, to UCSD Thursday and Friday to 
act as the "eyes and ears" of Pre ident Saxon a nd prepare a first 
hand report for the president. 

Saxon himself will be in San Diego Wedne day for a meeting of 
the systemwide Academic Senate Council, haired by UCSD's 
William Frazer, but said yesterday that it "is not my present 
intention" to talk with anyone about UCSD's problems. He will 
instead rely on Fretter's report, to be delivered sometime today or 
tomorrow, he said. 

F retter held a press conference Friday afternoon after the faculty 
interviews, but declined to discuss his conversations with the over 
thirty faculty members he met Thursday night and all day Friday. 

He did say, however, that the President's office is "very 
concerned" about the administrative problems here, and 
"surprised" at the speed with which events have proceeded. 

"Whenever a faculty becomes so distressed that they have a vote 

'Third' Gets Support of College 
Voters, But Turnout is a Question 

of a kind they took, it causes us 
great concern," Fretter said. 

That concern, Fretter said, 
manifested itself in this trip to 
UCSD, taken after Saxon and 
the system's to officers decided 
to end Fretter to gather 
information because of the 
Academic Senate vote of 231 -
116 last l'uesday expressing 
"no confidence" in McElroy's 
leadership. 

By Monet Payton 
Staff Writer 

Both students and faculty voted 
overwhelmingly to support the name "Third" last 
week in a yes-no election on the name concluded 
Friday, but questions over the election's turnout 
have cast a shadow on the results. 

Faculty favored the name "Third" by a three 
to one margin, students by two to one. 

Sixty percent of the faculty voted in the 
election, but only 25 percent of the students 
made it to the polls. 

The results will be officially released today, 
according to Third Acting Dean Susan 
Montrose. 

The Third College Council will meet this 
morning to decide whether 'Third" will be 
submitted to Chancellor McElroy's naming 
committee. Before this ballot, the Council said 
that the name would only be submitted if there 
was a 50 percent turnout of both faculty 
and students. 

This rule is not binding and "the Council can 
do whatever it wants," according to Third 
Provost Joseph Watson. 

Some student opponents of the name "Third," 
who coalesced last week into the "Lumumba· 
Zapata Movement Committee," said yesterday 
that the "low" turnout was a victory for their 
boycott of the elections. 

Spokesman Marcos Escajeda , a "Lumumba-
Zapata" AS representative, called for Third to 
"scrap plans for this year" to name the College, 
but "retain attempts by the Third community to 
name the college without the admini tration, 
faculty and Regents making the decision. " 

But College Council member Jules Bagneros, 
a student , says there is a "good chance" that the 
name will sti ll be submitted. It will then be 
debated by a university-wide naming committee. 

Muir Provost John Stewart's committee 
rejected the name "Third" last summer, arguing 
that the future students might not understand or 
appreciate the name's meaning. 

Bagneros believes that the Council will have a 
better chance of getting the name accepted this 
time because, he says, McElroy is especially 
sensitive to the need to get student input in 
decision making because of the administrative 
crisis over that problem. 

Fretter also declined 
comment on the vote, other 
than to say "on the face of it, it's 
a rather impressive display of no 
confidence." If ratified by the 
Senate's mail vote, McElroy 
would find it "very difficult" to 
func tion effectively, Fretter 
said. 

If McElroy should resign, 
Fretter said that University Hall 
does have several contingency 
plans. He declined to elaborate. 

He did make clear, though, 
that Saxon does not have the 
authority to remove McElroy. 
"Only the Regents can do that," 
Fretter told the press. 

Should McElroy resign ,

Fonda: 'I Won't Run for Office,' But ... 
By John Hondros 

Associate News Editor 
Although Jane Fonda claims 

she has no plans to run for 
public office, politics was the 
fo cus of her discussion 
Thursday night at a fund-raiser 
for the Campaign for Economi 
pemocracy. 

The audience, which paid 
$ 7 .50 to see and hear the 
Academy Award-winning 
actress and political activist 
before a special showing of her 
film Julia at Encinitas' La 
Paloma Theatre, heard Fonda 
blast multi-national corpora-
tions and discuss the need to 
promote solar energy. 

"Two hundred years ago the 
people who fought for our 
political rights were fil(htinl( 

against royalists," said ronda. 
"We are now in a position where 
we have to fight against a new 
kind of royalist - economic 
royalists. " 

She said these economic 
royalists are the 700 multi-
national corporations that "run 
our government and control our 
economy. They control 65 
percent of all sales, reap 79 
percent of all profits, produce 
76 percent of all manufactured 
goods and employ almost 50 
percent of all workers." 

During her 30-minute 
speech, Fonda also criticized 
the government for makin~ the 
US dependent on nuclear 
energy. "They say that Three 
Mile Island proved that nuclear 
is sale because no one died; that 

is so cruel in my mind as to be 
almost unbelievable." 

Before her speech, in a 
cramped apartment on the 
theatre's second floor, Fonda 
tnld the press that no one 
involved with The China 
Syndrome was surprised that 
the Three Mile accident 
occurred at the time of the film 's 
release. "It was inevitable. The 
extensive research we did in 
preparing for the film showed us 
that this country is filled with 
Three Mile Islands." 

Fonda sees solar as the 
alternative energy source. 
"Solar energy is not just a 
liberal, alfalfa sprout-eating 
environmentalist's issue; it is a 
fundamental economic issue,"

T Titan Times 
Paper 'Founded as 

to Daily Guardian 
Alternative to Indicator 

By Rot- Showle, 
P ublication today of The Daily Guardian fulfiU. a 

13·year dream at UCSO 
begun by a .mall coUection of 
amateur journalist •. 

In the UC .ystem, journalism 
is not conlidered an academic 
pursuit. 'It is a trade, more suited 
to the practical.minded .tate 
and community colleges. Thus, 
any group of_ students that

almost none of them had ever 
been involved directly in putting 
out a newspaper. A couple of 
planners , including this 
reporter, had written 
occa.ionally for the Indicator. 
A couple of others had worked 
on their high school papers. 

Finally, the first issue of the 
Triton Time. - taking it. 
name from the school mascot 
and Revelle Time. - was 
published on May 26, 1967. it 
was an eight.page tabloid 
featuri"B article. on the new 
ASUCSO officers, building 
plans for the Central Library, 
medical school and Muir 
CoBege, sporla and an editorial 

layi~ out the aim of the IT: 
"This newspaper intends to 

throw out a new and 
constructive meNage and to 
properly represent the great 
majority of students who 
consider themselves done a 

d'iuervice by the current 
unfavorable image of coUege 
youth across the nation and 
around the world. II 

A - look at the meager 
physical facilities of those early 
days - ,compared to the 
computerized cathode.ray tube 
technology with which this issue 
was published · gives an idea of 
how primitive things were. The 
staff operated out of a room 
hardly bigger than a dorm room 
in Bldg. 250, on the site of one 
of the new medical school 
buildings. There were two 
typewriters . A ponderous 
machine in another wing - the 
Justowriter - was used to set 
type. 

In 1969, after major pleas to 
the AS and administration, 
operations were moved to 'a 
larger room in the bottom floor 
of Blake Hall at Revelle 
CoUege. The Justowriter was 

operated out of a closet. Finally, 
all operations were contracted 
to a North County publisher , 
freeing students to concentrate 
on writing and editing. 

Another time, when Gov. 
Reagan closed down all UC 
campuses in the wake of the 
Kent State killings in the spring 
of 1970, the IT staff put out its 
first "extra" on a letter-size 
sheet , published at a small 
printer's in La JoUa. 

The largest edition for many 
years was published June 14, 
1968, on the occasion of the 
graduation of the first class. It 
was 24 pages long, featured 
blue and gold colors and 
covered everything from Third 
World issues to the assassina· 
tion of Sen. Robert Kennedy. 

Salaries were instituted for 
editors and advertising sales 
people when it was found that 
virtually new staffs had to be 

created every quarter; many 
students could not afford to 
contribute 10 hours a week of 
free labor and love. The first 
salary for editor·in·chief was 
$20 an issue. 

Editors,like Steve Landau in 
1969-70, spent nearly as much 
time politicking as publishing. A 
communications Board was 
formed by the chancellor to 
oversee student publications 
and allocate student registration 
and government fees. 
Sometimes, editors would lobby 
in donnitory meeting halls to 
gain student support. When 
The TT /Guardian went 
independent financially, these 
political maneuvers became less 
important. 

The usual casualty in all this 
was grade point averages .

earned 3.5 or better sacrificed

The reason? First, we were

the idea, sometimes called 
obsolete, that a relatively

previous Jlme, such as it was, 
often had evaporated on 
graduation day. 

The paper nonetheless grew. 
In 1974-75, editor Malcolm 
Smith expanded publication 
from two to three days a week. 
The next year, we gave up 
$25,000 a year in student fee 
money, realizing that it would 
be impossible to cover student 
government when we had such 
a big financial stake in it. It took 
editors Dave Eisen and Mark 

Stadler (1976.77) and Alan 
Russell ( 1977 ·78) to make 
these brave notions work and 
set the newly independent paper 
firmly on its feet. 

Last September saw another 
key change in the Triton 
Times. In a way, that name 
beca me a burden in 1 974 when 
the editors ran an April Fool's 
Day issue whose message was, 
though unintentionally so, 
racist. "Triton Times" sounded 
almost like child 's play with its 
nursery-rhyme alliteration; 
editors sometimes fell over each 
other in the playpen trying to 
amuse or stun each other and 
their readers. Coincidentally, 
the campus radical journal, 
which changed ' names almost 
with the tides, found the name 
North Star tainted after it was 
forced by angry Jews to 
repudiate an anti-Zionist article 
on the Palestinians. Since then 
the Triton Times/Guardian 
has never run an April Fool's 
issue, and the leftists mostly 
have steered clear of the Middle 
East. We aU learn from our 
miscalculations. 

It was with stern seriousness 
that the 1978-79 staff renamed

Pope Visits Poland 
GNIEZNO, Poland (AP) - Pope John Paul II 

began his "religious pilgrimage" in this ancient Polish 
capital yesterday and told hundreds of thousands of 
worshippers "this Slav pope" and the Roman Catholic 
Church have not forgotten them. 

As the 59·year-old pontiff celebrated Mass in a 
sweltering heat before an estimated half million faithful 
in a field outside the city, an unidentified man held up a 
banner, written in Czech, saying: "Holy father, don 't 
forge t about the children in Czechoslovakia," 

The pontiff saw the banner and said: "The pope 
can't forget about these children. We can't forget our 

- brothers."

No Nuke Efforts 
(AP) - Thousands of anti-nuclear activists, many 

trained in civil diso6edience, marched on several 
nuclear sites yesterday during a weekend of 
international protests that led to more than 400 
arrests . 

As a prelude to what was billed as International 
Anti-Nuclear Day by environmentalist groups, 
demonstrations involving upwards of 30,000 people 
were staged Saturday in l2 states, Canada, the 
Netherlands and Japan. 

About 500 policemen were stationed Sunday to 
gua rd a $ l .5 billion nuclear plant near the Long Island 
community of Shoreham, N .Y. , as a crowd estimated 
at between 4 ,000 and 5 ,000 gathered at a nearby 
public beach for an anti -nuclear rally. 

Carter Defends Record 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Carter says 

the nation 's skepticism about whether there is truly an 
energy shortage is "an inability or unwillingness to deal 
with an unpleasant subject. " 

" I don't interpret it as a personal attack on me or a 
rejection of leadership," Carter said in a television 
interview yesterday, 

"The problem is with us on a permanent basis. And 
I think we 've hade a tremendous amount of progress in 
the last two years, because there's a growing 
awareness that we do indeed have a problem," Carter 
said,

Picassos Damaged 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Expert. at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art examined eight vandalized 
paintings yesterday to determine if the artworks -
including two Picassos - could be restored easily. 

The eight paintings were defaced Friday evening 
with an unidentified object, authorities said. 

In a preliminary examination, museum experts 
described the damage as "largely superficial" and said 
the paintings "all could be readily restored ." 

The museum declined to reveal the exact nature of 
the damage, but unofficial police reports said some of 
the paintings were cut and some were marked with a 
substance similar to crayon, said Wilshire Division 
Sgl. Randall Lloyd,

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The California 

Association of Highway Patrolmen is urging its

Three women and two men

students and five administrators 
have spent three months 
looking for a replacement for 
Jim Beckley, who resigned as

from Ohio, al)Other is from 
Washington and a fourth is 
from New York, said Walsbok. 
Judith Green, acting dean at 
Muir, is the only California 
resident among the group, 
according to Walshok. 

, Walshok would not disclose 
the precise location of the 
candidates, but said two are 

from private schools, 'two work 
at medium·sized colleges and 
one candidate is from a major 
university . 

A sixth, male candidate was 
also chosen by the , committee 
but has not been located or 
notified of the present dean 
selection developments , 
according to Walshok. 

Although s"e did 'not t:eem 
confident that the candidate 
would be located, "we're still 
working on it," said Walshok.

After concluding interviews 
of the five candidates this week, 
a new dean should be chosen by 
the early part of finals week and 
will probably take office 
sometime this summer, said 
Walshok. 

While the committee did not 
rely upon a prioritized list of 
necessary credentials for the 
dean post,it sought candida tes 
"who h"d broad student affairs 
experience ... and coul d 
understand the yalues of a 

research institution," remarked 
Walshok. 

But the commi ttee also 
searched for candidates who 
could promote a "slight shift in 
emphasis" in the role of Muir 
dean, according to Walshok , 

"We're looking for a strong 
administrator," said Stewart. 
"We want someone who has a 
very sympathetic interest in the 
academic side." 

Stewart explained that 
previous Muir deans have 
focused primariry on student 
counseling and have not been 
sufficiently concerned with 
faculty goals and interests . 

"We want to avoid a 'we 
against them' attitude," Stewart 
commented. As a result, the 
new dean should be able to 
" reinforce a sense of belonging" 
for both students and faculty, 
said Stewart. 

Muir's 10.year report, which 
was released early this year, 
had a "very powerful influence" 
in motivating this shift, 
according to Stewart. In the 
report , many students noted a

Final Selection Near 

Three Women, Two Men On List 
For 'New Look' in Muir Dean 

(Continued from page 4) 
feeling of lonliness and 
alienation at Muir , said Stewart. 

Stewart and the search 
committee also have placed a 
strong emphasis upon women in 
their selection of dean 
candidates. 

Both of the past deans at 
Muir have been men. While 
Stewart would not say if he is 
looking for a woman to fill the 
post, he called his appointment 
of Walshok as head of the 
c ommittee " very deliberate ." 

"I wanted to send a signal to 
everybody that I wanted a dean 
who was interested in the needs 
of women on campus, " 
remarked Stewart. Walshok , 
who has been active in 
promoting women's rights, was ' 
a logical choice to chair the 
committee, he said. 

" If any candidate had any 
bias toward women, Mary 

would soon smoke them out,1> 
explained Stewart. 

However , Walshok was not 
Stewart's first choice to head the 
committee. Originally Quelda 
Wilson , then a summer session 
administrator , c haired the 
committee, but resigned from 
the position when she was 
promoted to personnel direc tor 
in February, said Stewart. 

Another deliberate appoint· 
ment to the committee was 
Etoy Villa , student affirmative 
action committee chair, 
according to Walshok . 
Although a Third College 
student, Stewart said Vala was 
included in the committee in 
order to represent Chicanos' 
interests. 

Although none of the five 
candidates who have been 
contacted are ethnic minorities, 
the sixth is a minority , said 
Walshok. 

Each candidate will be 
interviewed by both the 
committee and Stewart. In 
addition, candidates will meet 
separately with the student 
affairs staff at Muir, the three 
coUege deans at UCSD, Larry 
Barrett, Director of Auxiliary 
Services, and Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage, according to 
Stewart. 

Stewart noted that he is not 
limited to the committee'. 
choice of dean in his final 
selection, but "it would be very 
extraordinary if I went against 
the " -m. 

Walshok said a Gnal selection 
will probably be made by June 
12 or 13. Stewart will review the 
committee's final recom· 
mendation of two candidates 
within the next week or two and 
will send his final choice to 
Armitage for approval.

(Continued from page 1) 
she commented . "We'd be 
creating 400 ,000 jobs every 
year, cutting California's 
unemploYJ:llent in half. " 

Fonda cited an unreleased 
federal study conducted two 
years ago which says that if 
$500 million of the $8 billion 
annual budget ,of the energy 
department was invested in 
photo voltaic cells (silicone cells 
that take the sun 's light and 
transform it into electricity), the 
US would have solar electricity 
that would be competitive with 

nuclear by 1983. 
"We could phase out nuclear 

entirely by a source of energy 
that is safe, renewable , 
democratic, makes sense and is 
job intensive," she said, 

Fonda stressed , that solar 
technology presently exists. "It 
exis ts in 'srael; part of the Dead 
Sea is a solar catch basin that 
provides electricity ... ln fact, 
your Board of Supervisors 
recently passed a landmark 
ordinance that says all new 
residential buildings in San 

Diego must have solar hot 
water." 

When asked if she had plans 
to run for public office, she 
replied, "I won't run for office; I 
am an actress," though she has 
recently been appointed to the 
California Arts Council by 
Governor Brown. 

Fonda, who, as one observer 
noted , has "corne a long way

completed five months on 
location in St. George, Utah, 
filming The Electric 
Horseman.

Fretter and Frazer say. 

The last time a chancellor's 
post opened suddenly was at 

Santa Cruz, when the 
chancellor there resigned after a 
faculty conflict. A systemwide 
vice preSident a year from 
retirement filled in then , 
according to Frazer. 

Frazer also said that il the 
UCSD Academic Senate 
should vote the same way it did 

last week, overwhelmingly to 
show no confidence in the 
Chancellor, the systemwide 
Senate Council " will do what it 
can to make sure the Senate is

The five candidates were 
selected from an original group 
of about 200 applicants, 
according to Walshok. After a 
preliminary "weeding out" of 50 
applicants by personnel staff, 
the committee selected 15 or 16 
candidates from which they 
narrowed the list to the present 
five contenders, said Walshok. 

Walshok said she was 
somewhat surprised and 
pleased to find that both the 
students and administrators on 
the committee ranked the 
candidates very simaarly and 

Page~ 

was "terribly impreued by how 
loyal and conscientious the 
students (on the committee) 
have been,"

students Gary Moser, director

the committee.

ContDlunications 
Core Tightened 

Growth Lets Comm/Soc Go 
By Steve Schneider 

Staff Writer 
The UCSD- Communica· 

tions Program has undergone a I 
reorganization by its staff that 
has resulted in the establishrneqt 
of more specific requirements in 
its core curriculum. 

According to Program 
Coordinator Michael Cole. the 
e){pansion of the faculty has 
enabled the Program to provide 
a more comprehensive core 
curriculwn for the Communi. 
cations major programs. 

Until now students could 
fulfill two of the requirements by 
petitioning for classes of their 
own choice, Cole said. ' 

Under the new plan students 
must instead take specific 
c ourses to m eet these 
requirements. 

The reorganization has 
enabled the elimination of the 
Communications/ Sociology 
major, a program operated with 
the cooperation of the Sociology 
Department, according to Cole. 
With the changes in the 
Communications Program core 
structure, the Comm/ Soc 
major "doesn't make sense 
anymore," he explained. 

The newly organized 
curric'u1um takes into account 
the sociological aspects of 
Communications, eliminating 
the need for a joint major, Cole 

said. The Sociology Depart. 
ment agreed that the major is 
now unnecessary, he added: 

According to Jane Geddea, 
Administrative Coordinator for 
the Communications Program, 
the Comm/Soc major program 
lacked cohesiveness. 

The program included some 
Communications classes and 
some Sociology dasses, without 
much to tie them together, 
Geddes said. 

The Communications/ 
Visual Arts major will also be 
affected by the reorganization. 
According to Cole, the changes 
are still in progress, but the core 
requirements will probably be 
the same as in the Communi· 
cations major. 

A committee from the Visual 
Arts department is currently 
determining the Communi. 
catio/Visual Arts Program's 
needs from the visual arts point 
of view, Cole said, and by the 
time students get here next fall, 
we will have a program worked 
out." 

Students currently enroUed in 
the Communications Progr'WI 
will be permitted to compl~ 
their majors uniter the old 
requirements, Cole said . 
According to Geddes, these 
students may also petition for a 
change to the new require· 
ments .

Commentary 

Administration Tiff Has Sports Roots 
By Henry J. DeVries 

Staff Writ. 
Thi. i. not the fir.t time 

William McFJroy hal been in 
hot wale' with a ..uvenity, and 
as they ... y in the world of 
8pOrta, you can look it up. 

In 1939 it w8ln't Chancellor 
but Coach McElroy and 
the achool wa. Reed Colege in 
Portland, Oregon. McElroy 
W81 c~founder and coach of 
Reed'. firll footbaD learn and he 
piloted them to an undefeated 
le8101'1. 1be .ucceaa drew a 
warnin8 from the colege'. 
president, Dr. Dexter Keezer. 

Kidclintdy spurred on by the 
facUlty, whO didn't want Reed to 
become a "football factory," 
Keezer facetiOUIly announced 
that there wal a Itrong 
probability McElroy would not 
be retained if the team 
c<M"iinued to be a •• ucceaaful. 

Reed went 5·0 in '39 and 

received national publicity, 
including a writeup in Time 
magazine. The victories, 
however, were not again.t 
school. such 81 Notre Dame or 
USC. The team beat the local 
Civilian Conservation Camp 
three limes and another amaD 
Oregon Ichool twice. The 
ac:hedule was not exacdy what 
you would call awe.ome. 

But a win is a win, as any 
God.fearing footbaB coach will 
readily tell you. McElroy, who 
in addition to coaching was 
working on hit Maller. Degree 
in biology at Reed, W81 very 
familiar with football coaches. 

McElroy .tarred in football as 
an end, both at Pasadena City 
College and Stanford 
University. At PeC McElroy 
earned AU·American Juflior 
CoUege honors and went on to 
captain the Stanford SQuad. 

When Mc Elroy arrived at 

Pasadeila in 1935, the lIChool 
was known as a training 
growxl. for Howard Jones and 
his great USC Trojan football 
team.. McElroy left his 
hometown of Rogers, T exa. 
with four high school 
teammates to see what they 
could do at Pasadena. They did 
a (reat deal. 

PeC had a record of three 
wins, five losses and one tie in 
"Tex" McElroy's first season. 
In '36 he led the team to a 
perfect 9·0 year. But it wasn't 
on to USC for the star end. 

Coach Tiny Thornhill of 
Stanford offered McElroy an 
athletic lICholarship. McElroy 
preferred Stanford over USC for 
academic reasons, so he chose 
to head north for Palo Alto. The 
Trojans went on to the Rose 
Bowl and McElroy went for a 
degree in biology. 

As a junior McElroy played 

both ofiensive and defensive 
end for the 3·6·0 team of '37. In 
hi. senior year he captained the 
Stanford SQuad to a winning 4. 
3·2 season. It wasn't good 
enough for a trip back to 
Pasadena on New Year's Day, 
but McElroy had probably 
already seen the Rose Parade 
anyway. 

After graduation from 
Stanford, McElroy accepted a 
graduate assistantship position 
at Reed College. It was there he 
helped organize the infonnal 
football team which was to gain 
palional noteriety. 

However, McElroy isn't the · 
only individual involved in 
controversy who was a coUege 
sports star. None other than 
Paul Salim an made his mark in 
the world of intercollegiate 
athletics. 

Saltman was a basketball 
star at Cal Tech from 1947·

Overcast, rainy weather conditions did not stop over 1,()()() runners from competing in 
the UCSD Women's Caucus' Ii,..t annual 10 KM run. Wayne Buckingham, alliliatetl 
with the Jamul Toads running club, was Me Ii,..t to cro .. the linish line, with a time .oI 
31:30 lor Me 6.2mile course. Buckingham, 26, was closely pursued by Jon Black (31:52) 
in the men's 18-29 bracket. San Diego State's Diane Riley was the lirst woman to linish 
in a time 0137:10. Kay Harpold wc:rs right behind in 38 minutes. 

Thirteen·year.old Pat Green came aero .. in 36:45 to win the Men's 17 and under 
division. Shari Brooks won in 43:22 lor the women. 

For the 30·39 years olds Athol Barton was the men 's winner with a time 0/31:52. It 
was 35.year.old Rene Townsend's 42:51 that captured the women's division. 

Nicki Hobson 01 the San Diego Track Club was victorious in the Women's 40-49 
bracket in 42:30. In the 50 and over group Lucille Sandioli ran a 49:59 to win lirst place. 

Norm Secord won the Men's 40-49 division with a 34:36. David Fraitag completed the 
course in 39:40 in the Men's SO and over division. 

McElroy, Saltman Were Both Jocks Once. 
(Continued from page 6) 
supported himself playing pro 
basketball in that country. 

Sports are still very important 
to Sallman. He plays handball 
and tennis , skis and surfs. 
Sallman co mpares the 
discipline of the mind with the 
discipline of the body . 

But how do the sports 

backgrounds of McElroy and 
Sallman fi gure in the present 
UCSD controversy? An 
examination of the respective 
game plans definitely show a 
football vs. a basketball 
mentality at work. 

McElroy, the ex.grid iron 
coach, tried a power play up the 
middle but was thrown for a 
quick loss . On second down he 

tried an end around but failed to 
gain any yardage. With third 
and long the Chancellor 
reversed field , only to run into a 
solid wall of defenders. 

Saltman utilized his 
basketball experience and 
quickly used a fast break 
offense . Feeling there was 
plenty of time left on the clock, 
Saltman then went into a stall. 

What he will do now, whether it 
be ball control outside shots or a 
running .gunning offense, 
remains to be seen. 

McElroy's next play is also 
up in the air, although some 

observers feel its time to punt. 
Perhaps the ~nal play will be 
decided by a referee to the 
north , otherwise known as 
University of California 
President David Saxon. 

Erratum 

Sports Shorts 
A mistake was made in last 

Wednesday's (May 30) 
Guardian sports article about 
Triton pitcher Tom Nicholson. 
It was erroneously reported that 
the last UCSD baseball player 
to be drafted by the major 
leagues was Randy Maler by 
the Montreal Expos. However \ 
at the end of the 1975 season 
Mike Scar amelia , shortstop, 
was drafted by the Cinncinatti 
Reds. Scaramella signed a 

$13,500 contract and currently 
plays in the club's minor league 
fann system. 

At the end of the 1977 
season Triton catcher Gary 
Patton had a brief tryout with 
the San Diego Padres, but did 
not sign with the team. More 
recently, a scout from the 
Toronto Blue Jays has been 
inquiring about junior Marc 
Sharpe, a member of this year's 
14·25 squad. 

UCSD's crew team coach 
Jack Vallerga has been selected 
to be the assistant coach of the 
UC National Jr. Rowing team 
for 1979. He has also been 
named manager for the 
selection camp to be held in 

June. There Vallerga will 
choose the junior team which is 
composed of participants up to 
19 years old . In July, the group 
and Vallerga will travel to 
Belguim to race in the World 
Championships.

Masters' work is of great 

interest to Soviet gerontologists, 
who search for reasons certain 
Georgians live beyond 100 
years. 

"Quite extraordinary ages, 
168 and 140 have been 
claimed by Georgians," said 
Masters. He said the 168·year. 
ok:! Georgian had died, his birth 
date still undocumented. 

"A number of things have 

been kicked around as 
explanations of the Georgians' 
longevity, Masters said. One 
theory suggests they attain their 
longevity because the elderly 
Georgians are respected a nd 
live vital, necessary lives, 
according to Masters. 

The Georgians, like other 
inhabitants of the Caucasus 
mountains in the Soviet Union 
who are known for the ir 
longevity, are mainly fanners 

and herdsmen. Young and old 
alike are needed for tending the 
herds and fields , she said. 

Unlike Bada , who plans to 
travel to the People 's Republic 
of China soon to carry out fossi l 
dating experiments on recent 
archeological finds , Masters 
foresees "little probability" 0/

applied II loRiI dating technique

chemist Dr. Jeffery Bada tathe 
dating of living organisms, will 
analyze eye cataraell and teeth 
from living Georgians to 
determine their actual age. 

The actual age determination 
process, called racemization, 
was developed originally by 
Bada to provide an accurate 
method of fossil dating . The 
technique was later applied to 
the dating of living organisms 
by Mailers. 

Racemization involves 
measurement of the rate of 
change of amino acids into their 
optical isomer. which have 
identical molecular formula and 
structure but have "mirror 
image" configurations of bonds 
by comparison with the original 
amino acids.

Maryland, Malten' technique

Researchers at the UCSD 
School of Medicine have 
discovered a method of isolating 
an enzyme which is partially 
responsible for inducing comas 
in diabetics. 

Dr. Daniel Steinberg, head of 
the division of metabolism at the 
School of Medicine, has been 
working to solve this problem 
since he came here in 1964. 
Said Steinberg, "We 've been 
frustrated by the fact that 
everything we used to separate 
the enzyme from the fat cells in 
which it's produced destroys the 
enzyme." 

Recently, though, Steinberg

and his colleagues found that, 
under the right conditions, a 
substance called Triton X-toO, 
similar to common detergent, 
severs the usually tightly·bound 
enzyme unhanned from its 
parent cell. 

The enzyme, hormone· 
sensitive lipase, stimulates the 
fat cell to release fatty acids into 
the blood stream when they are 
needed to supply energy to the 
body. It is "turned off, " or made 
inactive, by insulin. 

Because diabetics have 
insulin levels which are lower 
than normal, they are not able 
to halt the release of these fatty 
acids effectively. As a result , 

: once the enzyme is stimulated, 

the diabetic 's bloodstream 
becomes flooded with excess 
acids, upsetting the natural 
balance of the system and 
causing the person to sink into a 
diabetic coma. 

Having isolated the enzyme , 
Steinberg and his colleagues are 
now able to go on to detennine 
the mechanism by which it is 
made active and inactive. 

Steinberg noted that although 
several years ago it was learned 
that adrenalin activated the 
enzyme by adding a phosphate 
group to it, " it must be more 

. than just that." 
The researcher also hopes to 

learn exactly where in the cell

'Alien:' Get's What's Coming to Dine? 
T he publicity graphic for 20th Century.Fox's 

Alien looks like a 
twisted version of Mork and~ 
Mindy, complete with a 
misshapen egg on the verge of 
hatching a grid of Play-Doh 
modeling clay. However , from 
that point on, all resemblence to 
the television comedy series 
ends. 

The story begins on the 
commercial spacetug "Nos· 
tromo," whose five man and 
two woman crew is awakened 
ten months prematurely from its 
state of suspended animation. 
The reason: to intercept what is 
thought to be a distress call 
being transmitted from a nearby 
planetoid. After crashlanding 
their shuttle on the surface, 
three of the members attempt to 
track down the SOS signal. 
Their search leads them to an 
enormous space vessel. It is 
within the ship's massive 
confines that the trio meets the 
mysterious" alien" of the motion 
picture's title and inadvertently 
brings it aboard the spacetug. 
VVhat happens next adds a 
terrifying significance to the 
proverbial question, "Guess 
who's coming to dinner?" 

Alien is not without Its flaws . 

Jones, and the prolific growth of 
the alien that nearly fills the 
entire screen with only a single 
shedding of its skin. Although 
the plot's untidy points are a bit 
annoying to the viewers, the 
former anows the IaUer the 
advantage of filling the bare 
spots in at his own discretion. 

The cast's appearance in 
Alien is so ephemeral that not 
much can be said of the group's 
acting abilities . What can be 
deduced is that the seven actors 
are accurate prototypes of the 
cliche "motley crew." 1beir 
dialogue exchanges are as 
mangled and disconnected as 
the remains of the alien's 

victims. Scheduled for the 
creature's dining pleasure are 
Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), 
warrant officer Ripley 
(Sigourney Weaver), navigator 
Lambert (Veronica Caito 
wright), engineering technician 
Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), 
executive officer Kane (John 
Hurt), science officer Ash (Ian 
Holm) and engineer Parker 
(Yaphet Kotto). The scruffy 
and haggard look of the cast is 
further enhanced by costume 
designer John Mollo's 
wardrobe of garage sale, punk 
rock, and medieval fashions. 

Viewers screening Alien 
solely for its technical ingenuity 

will not leave the theater 
disappointed. The landscapes 
of artists H. R. Giger and 
Ronald Cobb are simul. 
taneously eerie and ethereal, 
while production designer 
Michael Seymour's ominous 
interiors of the alien's spacecraft 
appear to have actually been 
constructed by extraterrestrial' 
hands. There are a few items' 
here and there, such 81 the 
computer and instrument 
boards and the food containers 
of the "Nostromo," which are 
.trikingly reminiscent of Star 
Wan, and these suspicions are 
fully justified by the names of 
two of its art directors, Lea 

Dan O'Bannon, who enjoys the 
double literary credits of co· 
author (with Ronald Shusett) 
and screenwriter, as well as the 
pictorial recognition of visual 
concepts consultant, leaves 
several ideas which go on 
unexplained or unfinished . 
Among these loose ends are 
Captain Dallas ' enigmatic 
disappearance in his encounter 
with the alien, the unexpected 
appearance of the crew's cat, 

The late Space Gunner, juat a prelude to what the crew 01 the Noairomo linda in deep apace.

Midwest's 'Pere Ubu' Was 
Joined by New Wave Rock 

Pere Ubu - Dub Houaing 
(Chrysalis) 

M any o~ those who are acquainted with this band are inclined to lump 
them under that diffusely vague 
heading "New Wave," used to 
label any musical group that 
dresses distinctively, writes 
intelligently-worded rock songs, 
plays electric experimental 
music or exhibits any other 
unusual characteristic. To any 
such superficial attempt. at 

labelin~ their music, Pere Ubu 
' Merdre!" , 

,--.:....:..:..-....:. 

Ubu has been making waves 
around their hometown of. 
Cleveland since 1975, well 
removed from New York and 
London, where fashions and 
groupings were later to emerge .. 
Like fellow Midwestern outfit 
Devo, they had released 45s on 
their own label and built a local 
following .before the New Wave 
came to provide them with an 
outlet for an international 
audience. Since then, the band 
has signed with three major 
record labels, been dropped 
from one of them and 

reactivated their own small 
label, Hearthan. The first 
album, The Modern Dance, 
came out in early ' 78 on Blank 
Records , a small subsidiary of 
Phonogram which folded soon 
thereafter. 

This was followed by a 
British 12" 45rpm Radar 
Records repressing of selections 
from the four out-of.print self· 
pressed Ubu singles, called 
Datapanik in the Year Zero. 
Their second album , Dub 
Housing, ·came out late last 
year in England on Chrysalis 
and was released in' the US by 
that company this April. Unlike 
Devo , however, this band has 
s hown no inclination to 
.compromise their long.lasting 
idiosyncracies in pursuit of 
maximum intelligibility and a 
wider audience, that is to say, 
money. Wha tever weak points 
the new album may suffer from , 
these are not the result of 
commercialization. 

VVhat was so pleasing about 
the music on The Modern 
Dance was its ability to 
integrate experimental sound 
technique. effectively into 
raucou., danceable rock 'n' roU 
songs, with ' lean, imaginative 
arrangement.. Allen Raven· 
stine's intelligent use of tapel 

and synthesizer in this context 
had analogies with Eno's early 
work in Roxy Music , and the 
disjointed combination of crude, 
choppy guitar and free-form sax 
brought to mind Captain 
Beefheart's more disturbing 
moments. But whereas Roxy 
Music was always eccentrically 
elegant - Bryan Ferry is a 
dandy in the most tasteful 
tradition - Ubu proved 
themselves as psychopathic and 
extreme. When Roxy Music 
approached the theme of 
suburban despair ("In Every 
Dream Home a Heartache"), it 
was done in a manner that was 
restrained and removed. In 
"Sentimental Journey," Pere 
Ubu's version of the same 
theme, all the stops were pulled. 
Vo calis t David Thomas 
mumbles unintelligibly in a

glasses, while a taunting 
saxophone squawks ridicu· 
lously like hobgoblins from 
those hard·to·reach cobwebs in 
the corner . Unadulterated 
pandemonium. 

Dub Housing retains Ubu's 
characteristically disjointed 
style of arrangement and their 
brash, flailing enthusiasm, but 
where it too often falls flat is in 
its songs. It's not the 
unabashed, disharmonious

the crawl of credits. The special 
effects of ' director Brian 
Johnson and supervisor Nick 
Alder (both formerly of Space: 
1999) serve to produce the 
dual reactions of horror and 
humor in the darkest aense of 
Ihe words, as exemplified by the 
unusual entrance of the alien. 
Had the viewers' hearts not 
been in their throats in response 
10 the gruesome manner in 
which the creature first appears 
on the screen, they would have 
chuckled in spite of themselvel 
upon next hearing it make a 
burplike noise and slingshot its 
way out before an astonished 
"Nostromo" crew. In design, 
the alien adheres to the great 
tradition of the dallic science 
fiction B thrillers which pop up 
from time to time on television 
during the weekend's afternoon 
programming. However, no B 
picture couk:! have conceived,

The music score by Jerry 
Goldsmith is blatantly thematic, 
but this fael does not deter the 
composer from his ability to 
heighten the suspense of the 
weaving point of view angles 
and lingering pan shots by 
lighting cameraman Derek 
Vanlint. The minor chord hal 
an implied sini.terness to the 
"and they lived happily ever

addition, the background noises . 
of the overall soundtrack draw 
on the parallel of an old 
abandoned house given to 
creaks, groans, whistles and 
other unsettling quirks, which 
keep the viewers' heartrates

Ships That

S ince going back to college at the age of thirty, Sheila had developed the tendency to believe everything she read. True to the ravages of a bad habit, she now fancied herself an

one who's got the interest in all this esoteric stuff. I'm ju~t a bone-
head .... " 

They stayed that way for several minutes, kissing deeply, trying 
to assuage each other'. hurt with the passing of tongue and spit. 
Afterward., Sheila went back into the kitchen while Mike sat back 
down with a newspaper. He began to read a 61m review on 
Manhattan when he heard Sheila on the phone. 

"Yes, yes," she said, "the reading was good, butl'U tell you, that 
guy's abilitie. as a reader go a long way in saving mediocre poems. 
I mean, confessional poetry died with Robert Lowell and Sylvia 
Plath. If he could take thOle images and make them into hard, 
polis!led objects-; like, say William Carlos Williams or Robert 
Creely, then I think he'd be ~lter off. No ideas but in things, 
y'know ... anyway, I think hi. reading 'was fine, but all that 
introspective stuff tended to obfuscate the real value. There was no 
condensing of the experiences or the ideas .. .. " 

As her voice carried on' at a pace only a speed freak could 
manage, Mike let his eyes fall off the print on the page_ His teeth 
caught the hairs of his mustache, and with his lower jaw willfully 
jutting out, pulled the strands from the skin. He relished every sting 
of pain.

contrived. It is not that 
discontinuity has no place in 
rock or pop music. Another 
"New Wave" group named 
Wire, on the album Chair. 
Mining, takes the method of 
discontinuity in their 
compositions to convincing 
extremes, and does it ' so 
effortlessly that they sound 
almost conventional. Ubu 's 
attempts by comparison are 
limp and affected. For one 
thing , what was one of the 
strengths of the first Ip, its 
straightforward, boisterous rock 
'n' roll, is lacking here. Pere 
Ubu's misjudgement is not that 
of having abandoned rock 'n' 
roll, but rather that they have 
not traded it in for anything 
better. 

The Daily Guardian needs 
arts writers for next year, 
especially reviewers for books 
(fiction), classical music, 
television, and other areas that 
have been overlooked this year. 
Also, the arts department could 
use people interested in writing 
feature articles and personality 
pieces about local artists, both 
on the UCSD faculty and in the 
community. Interested? You 
won't get rich, but, if you cut the 
cake, you can see your narne in 
print. Contact Ted Burke in 
The Daily Guardian office, in 
the Student Center, or call 452-

(Continued from page 5) 
anything like this again") kept 
him busy most of Thursday 
night and Friday from 8 am to 6 
pm, when he left for Berkeley. 

It did not include any student 
representatives, which brought 
an apology from Fretter and an 
invitation to AS representatives 
to come up to Berkeley some 
time this week to discuss 
McElroy's problems. 

Professors Fretter met with 
contacted by The Guardian 
say they argued the same points 
that have been already debated 
in the Academic Senate. 

Supporters of the Chancellor 
said the Senate acted with 
undue haste and emotion, and 
while they admitted that the 
Chancellor has often not 
consulted students and faculty 
on important decisions, they 
take his word that he will 
reform. 

They also told Fretter that 
removing McElroy now would 
cause major problems with the 
university's image in other parts 
of the country, and might make 
it more difficult to find 
competent administrators in the 
future. 

"We're going to scare people 
who might make good 

admini strators from comi ng 
here, " one professor said . 

Supporters of the "no 
confidence" resolution said, as 
they did in the Academic Senate 
session las t Tuesday, that 
McElroy has only consulted 
with faculty or students when 
forced to, and is not likely to 
change. 

On the Senate agenda for 
Saxon's visit, coincidentally, is 
a proposal which calls for 
formal reviews of each 
campus's chancellor on a 
rotating basis , according to 
frazer .

Original Triton Times Claimed Intent 
To Represent Majority of Students 

(Continued from page 2) 
academic excellence for mere 
survi val in order to put out the 
paper on time. Indeed , the first 
editor, Senn, transfered to 
UCLA in his senior year to 
rescue his GPA. 

In the 12 years since that first 
Triton Times, much has 
changed in student newspa· 
pering at UCSD. It is a tribute to 
the succession of editors, 
wri ters and produ c t io n 
managers that the newspaper 
has weathered competition, 
student government and 
administrative interference and 
intolerance, recessionary 
setbacks in advertising and the 
nev~r-ending demands of an 

academic load with no credit 
granted~ for publishing the 
paper. 

Along the way, an editor 
has been fired by a chancellor, 
threats have been issued by 
political groups, sit·ins have 
been staged, funds have been 
suspended , writers a nd 
photographers have been 
threatened. But the TT - and 
now The Daily Guardian -
has always published . 

In the eighth floor of the 
Central library, the special 
coUections section houses each 
year's bound editions of the 
ca mpus ' various student 
newspapers . 

There are no other student 

Journalistic Adolescence 
Done; Name, Paper Grown 
(Continued from page 2) 
their paper The Guardian. The 
new name is grown up, almost 
paternalistic in tone ; it implies a 
renewed commitm ent to 
thoroughness and compre -
he nsivenes s that is more 
invigorating than anything a 
"T riton Times" could have 
mustered. 

And the staff has made good 
on its promise with a year of 
journalism unsurpassed since 
Showley's ragged crew began 
publishing under a hand-drawn 
logo in 1967. The writing is 
sharp and authoritative. Writers 
follow up their stories, and are 
developing the instincts that 
whisper at them to make one 
more phone ca ll , to check the 
spelling of that name, to mllke 
sure that quote is accurate. 

It was no accident that this 
year's Guardian was able to 
playa central parr in exposing 
the leadership clash that shook 
UCSD this spring. The moment 
I heard a professor had 
grumbled about the paper's 
"macho journalism" - the 
paper was blamed for keeping 
administrators from duking it 
out in private over the summer 
- I knew the paper had become 
the major force at UCSD that it 
has always wanted to be. 

Today, The Guardian is 
The Daily Guardian. Its 
editors promise journalism that 
will focus on. people instead of 
institutions, on solutions instead 
of complaints. They are goals 
that are within reach for a paper 
that , finally , has come of age. 

Diabetic Coma Enzyme 
Isolated After 15 Years 

(Continued from page 10) 
the enzyme is produced. By 
coupling an antibody and 
ferritin , a compound composed 
of iron and protein, Steinberg 
will synthesize a substance that 
will be ingested by the cell. 
With the aid of an electron 
microscope, he said he would be 
able to " trace it (the compound) 
through the cell to determine the 
source of the enzyme." 

.. Another exciting possi-
bility ," said Steinberg, "is that 
there is more than one active 
site on the enzyme." An active 
site is a distinct binding location 
on the surface of the enzyme. 
The existence of more than one 
on the hormone-sensitive lipase 
indicates that the enzyme may 
play a role in several different 
bodily functions. 

According to SteinLerg, the 
research on the enzyme is not 
directed toward curing diabetes, 
although it may help scientists 
to understand the disease better. 
" I think the studies are mainly' 
interested in understanding the-
mole c ular structure and 
mechanism of production of the 
enzyme more than trying to 
work directly toward a cure for 
diabetes," he said. 

The researcher explained, 
though, that once people 
understand how insulin affects 
the enzyme in normal cells, it 
will be easier to discover what 
"goes wrong" in diabetes . 

Although the work on 
isolating the enzyme was 
completed several months ago; 
Steinberg and his colleagues 
made their results public only 
recently. .

'Alien' Gory 
(Continued from page 12) 
consistently high. . -

Alien is an appropriately R-
rated motion picture. Viewers 
who possess a tendency to 
become squeamish or have 
never learned to close their eyes 
in the advent of blook and gore 
should not see the movie , and 
those who go anyway do so at 
their own risk . The scare tactics 
fall under the category of a 
roller coaster effect. h starts off 
with two small, but substantial 
shockers. The viewers then 
expect a larger one to follow, 
but it is not the case. However, 
just as soon as they a~ 
expressing their disappoint· 
ment, the delayed thrill catches 
them in full force and another 
cycle begins anew. 

The release of Alien 
coincides with the first screen 
a nniversary of another 20th 
Century-fox production, Star 
Wars. In [he brief time it has 
been showing at the fashion 
Valley 4 Theaters, the former's 
lines of viewers are already 
rivalling those of the latter's 
proportions a year ago. 
However, anyone who resorts 
to making compariso ns 
between the two films should be 
subjected to spending an hour in 
a locked room with the creature. 
Alien is a science fiction 
achievement in its own right, for 
which no similar efforts, past or 
present, come close to being 
considered an equal. 

Open Pool 
Hours 

The UCSD pool will be open 
for special recreation hours 
during finals week to give 
students a chance to "release 
tension and anxieties," 
according to Director of 
Recreation John Cates. The 
special hours will be 7:30 - 9am, 
noon - 2pm, 4 - 6pm and 7:30-
10pm.

Dean is Tired of Making Enemies 

'Mellowed' Varga Returns to 
By Kathy Huffer 

Auoci.te New. Editor 
Lo.oking almost unrec-

ognizeable in her slimmer, hair-
.tyled form, Bev Varga will 
resume her post as Third 
Colege dean Friday after more 
than three month's absence. 

"I think I've really mellowed 

out," Varga says. " I won't let 
the pressures of the job get to me 

. " again. 
Varga unexpectedly left her 

post February 21 because of 
"an overload of work" and took 
time off to relax in her first 
vacation in 20 years. 

If her job affects he~

physically again, she says, " I'll 
move out." I was "constantly 
having to fight for Third" and 
since has become tired of 
making enemies. 

During her absence, Varga 
was replaced by Susan 
Montrose, assistant dean at 
Third. Although Varga will 
return in one week, she will not 
resume full responsibility as 
dean until June 30. 

Montrose explained that 
Varga will not take over her 
past duties until then in order to 
make a smooth transition 
between temporary and 
permanent dean administrators 
and so that planning begun by 
Acting Assistant Dean Carol 
Holmes won't have to be 
abruptly turned over to me." 

Varga requested to return in 
time for Third's graduation next 
week, and will lead the graduate 
processional during the 
ceremony. 

Varga remarked that 
although she looks forward to 
returning to Third, " I'm still 

cautious. I'm a little afraid of it." 
"There's so many pressures 

at Third," she explained. "One 
of my problems is that I've 
taken it too seriously." 

Varga said she needs to take 
a "male attitude" in order to 
cope with these pressures, 
explaining that most male 
administrators she works with at 
UCSD are more casual about 
their jobs and seem to perceive 
their duties as a game. 

Although Varga offered to 
"let someone else carry the 
banner" for Third 's contro-
vt:rsial struggles, she stressed 
that her work with students will 
not change from the past. 

"The reward in that job has 
been in the students," 
commented Varga. 

While students have viewed 
her as a martyr, Varga said, the 
administration at Third sees her 
as "feisty ." Varga noted that 
she receives the lowest salary of 
the four deans at UCSD, 
partially, at least, because "my 
bosses don't think I'm as good

as the other deans." 

Nevertheless, Varga said she 
does not anticipate conflicts 
within the administration at 
Third and will continue the work 
she left last quarter. 

She will soon have to end "the 
first time in my life that I've been 
thinking about myself 
physically ... and the first time 
I've told myself that it's okay to 
have fun ," she said.
