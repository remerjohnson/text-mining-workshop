BERKELEY-Up to 75 
percent of tOOay's breast 
cancer cases were caused by 
past medical X-rays, accord-
ing to a recent study con-
ducted by Dr. John Gofman, a 
UCB professor emeritus of 
molecular and cellular 
biology. Gofman estimates 
that a majority of the 182,000 
cases of breast cancer 
diagnosed each year are 
caused by X-rays received up 
to 60 years ago, at a time 
when non-standardized doses, 
many times more powerful 
than today's X-ray doses, 
were often applied repeatedly 
and unnecessarily.

Carla Tesak 
leaves office 
after a two-

. year reLgn 
as A.S. 

president 

Guardian Profile 

Desperate times call for desperate measures. The outrageous cost of housing, both on and off campus, was a thorn in A.S. President Carla Tesak's side. For months 
she had been working on a plan to establish 
affordable student housing and by last May, had 
met with nothing but frustration. The adminis-
tration had nixed every proposal. 

Finally, she heard a new idea: an on-campus 
tent city with dozens of large tents, cots for beds 
'and trunks for students' belongings. Rent would 
be almost nothirog, classes would be nearby and 

affordable housing would be a 
reality. "Everybody would want 
to live in a tent," Tesak told any-
one who would listen. 

She plotted and planned the 
newest addition to campus hous-
ing, meeting with campus plan-
ners, pricing tents and drawing 
maps. A constant stream of in-
creasingly alarmed administra-
tors stopped by her office to see 
if tbis was for real. 

"I kepttelling them, 'Oh yeah, 
yeah. I'm very serious .... I think 
it's a great idea.' I wouldn't even 
acknowledge any of their points 
that it wasn't a great idea," Tesak 
said in an interview last week, as 
sbe prepared to leave office after 
two years as A.S. president. 

Sbe laughs now, admitting 
what a horrendous idea it was. 

N&uYen/Gunlan But it was never her desire to 
C.rI. Teak p8Cka up 8ft., two build a tent city. AU that mat-
y..,. • the helm of the A.S. tered was that the administration 

believed she was serious. 
"I knew tbe administration would die before 

having a tent city on this campus," she said. "I 
knew they would just flip. I mean, how would 
you like to bring parents in and say, 'Oh yeah, 
by the way, there is our homeless center for 
students?'"

Main Gym's 
Fate Remains 
Clouded in 
Controversy 
DISPUTE: Administration 
proposal angers UCSD 
dance program members 
By Marianne VlJlI 
Associate News Editor 

Drawing sharp criticism from UCSD 
dance students, the administration decided 
last week to reconsider its plan to allow the 
dance program to renovate the Main Gym 
for its own purposes. Currently, the Main 
Gym houses university events, intramural 
and club sports, basketball and dance 
classes. 

The original decision, which was made 
by ChanceIlor Richard Atkinson over three 
months ago, transferred the Main Gym's 
management from Student Affairs Sports 
Facilities to Academic Affairs. The ad-
ministration determined that the Main Gym 
was to be used and renovated primarily for 
academic purposes, with priority being 
given to the dance program's needs. 

In a May 3 memorandum, however, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
Watson proposed tbat the Main Gym con-
tinue to be managed by Student Affairs. 

Rather than aIlowing the dance pro-
gram complete use of the Main Gym, the 
proposal gave the program scheduling pri-
ority for the North and West Balconies, the 
Recreational Gym Conference Room and 
the Main Gym floor. The proposal did not 
specify what kind of renovations would be 
made. 

The dance program, which has been 
part of the Theatre Department for three 
years, offers a minor in dance and may 
soon offer a dance major. According to 
A.S. President Naomi Falk, $1 million had 
already been set aside for the renovations, 
which were to begin in July. 

According to Vice Chancellor of Aca-
demic Affairs Marjorie Caserio, the ad-
ministration reconsidered its original de-
cision because a substantial number of 
letters were received from students who 
objected to the loss of the Main Gym for 
recreational purposes.

In an effort to stamp out drinking 
and driving on college campuses, a 
coalition of student groups represent-

veiled a "responsible partying" plan at 
a press conference Thursday. 

San Diego 's Intercollegiate Im-

from UCSD, University of San Diego, 
Mesa Coilege and Miramar College. 

"Our goals are increasing aware-

GENOME: Leroy Hood emphasizes importance of 
computer technology in mapping human genetics

Students. professors and busi-
ness leaders explored the future of 
bioengineering and lelecommuni-
cations last Thursday and Friday at 
UCSD's School of Engineering's 
Annual Research Review Ind Na-
tional Engineering Forum. 

UCSD School of Engineering 
students displayed tbeir research 
projects in a poster format on Tburs-
day. Areas of re-
search included 
computer science. 
electrical engineer-
ing, applied me-
chanics and bioengi-
neering. 

"The process of miniaturization ... 
and the increase of (efficiency] are 
incredibly important areas of 
bioengineering," said Hood. "The 
real challenge to engineering is the 
putting together of complex se-
quences." 

Despite technological advance-
ments, Hood predicts that mapping 
the entire human genome will take 
another 100 years. 

However, Hood said tbe im-
proved technology will be able to 
determine patients' likelibood of 

contracting a dis-
ease if they possess 
a certain gene pat-
tern. 

The student pre-
sentations were fol-
lowed by speakers . 
representing tbe 
telecommunica-
tions industry and 
science academia on 
Friday.

"Ratber ihan wait-

Hood also urged 
scientists to step out

come more instru-
mental in the devel-
opment of educa-
tional programs for

to map DNAscquences. wbich com-
prise the human genome. 

"The enormous increase in abil-
ity to decipher biological informa-
tion is really exciting," said Hood. 
"Almost all the major tools of com-
puter science will be essential in

According to Hood; if the code 
of the human genome were typed 
out, it would occupy 500 yolumes. 
each containing 1.000 pages. In or-
der to make the process of mapping 
the genome cheaper and more effi-
cient. Hood said engineers face the 
task of developing smaller and more 
sensitive tecbnology . 

Dorfman, dis-
cussing the future of telecommuni-
cations, said the industry centers 
around fixed, wireless communica-
lion technology, connected to satel- . 
lites. Dorfman's corporation, 
Hughes Telecommunications and 
Space Company, has manufactured 
Ind launched over 100,000 satel-
lites in the lUI 13 years. 

Dorfman said that cutling-edge 
designs in telecommunications arc 
digital wireless telephony, much of 
which have been developed in San 
Diego. 

According to Dorfman, progress 
in telecommunications will give

after hearing testimony from 
dance students at its May 3 meet-
ing, tbe A.S. wrote a resolution 
in favor of giving the Main Gym 
to the dance program if another 
adequate facility could not be 
found. ~ _ 

In a letter. to Atkinson, Falk 
wrote. "tbe council believes that 
the needs of students in their aca-
demic pursuits shOuld take pre-
cedence over the recreational 
needs of otber students." 

Theatre Department Chair Jim 
Carmodie said dancers have suf-
fered injuries due to inadequate 
facilities. 

"It isn't just space that we 
need. it's dance space." said 
dance student Cecilia Michelson. 

"Our [original] concern was 
that otber people wbo use the 
gym would no longer be able to. " 
said Falk. "In the event that an 
alternative [which will accom-
modate everyone] can't be found, 
an academic need needs to take 
precedence over extracurricular 
activities ... 

Carmodie said the department 
supports the needs of the dance 
program and Ihal no space will

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, May 8,1995 

PINION 
armed & 

The hysteria 
surrounding 
militias 
threatens to 
undermine 
Constitutional 
freedoms 

ith the recent 
bombing of a federal 

office building in 
Oklahoma City, pub-

lic scrutiny turns to 
armed militia groups, crime and Sec-
ond Amendment rights. Frighten-
ingly enough, many Americans be-
lieve that rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution do not apply to elements 
of society with which the majority 
disagrees: Sixty-eight percent of 
those questioned in a recent Time 
magazine poll thought the federal 
government should "spy on militia 
groups in order to monitor their ac-
tivities. Another poll released by the 
Cato Institute indicated that 72 per-
cent of Americans would give up 
their First Amendment rights to "be guaranteed se-
curity and safety." Presumably, this security would 
come from the government. Brokers offederal in-
fluence, all too eager to expand their ever-present 
tentacles deeper into society, capitalize on public 
sentiment against the bombing in Oklahoma City 
and juxtapose it with the militia groups. 

However, by scape-goating militia groups, influ-
ence-peddlers in Washington also increase these 
groups' visibility, which could, in tum, lead to the 
government's downfall . Nol many years ago, militia 
groups - largely comprised of white males - gath-
ered clandestinely and conspired to overthrow their 
government. Their foremost complaints against the 

current monarch were: "He has raised taxes and levies 
without our consent ... , has raised up numerous regula-
tory agencies for the purpose of harassing our people ... , 
has, in times of peace, maintained standing armies .... " 

Dissatisfied with the lack of response from the ~v­
ernment when their petition fell on deaf ears, these 
rebels staged a bloody revolutionary war, whose after-
math birthed a nation founded under some radical 
propositions- such as the outrageous notion that citi-
zens possess a set of "inalienable rights" and funda-
mental freedoms. The purpose of the government was 
to serve these principles and defend these rights. Be-
cause these militia men felt so strongly that these in-
al ienable rights not be altered by future generations, 

DacRIBlNCIlHI MIUTIA THREAT 
they made these rights the 
supreme law of the land. 

Anyone who did not 
sleep all the way through 
U.S. history in high school 
should recognize the quote 
as an excerpt from the 
Declaration of Indepen-
dence and this scenario as 
the Revolutionary War. 
Just a little over 200 years 
ago, the United States was 
founded by militia men, 
tax resisters and armed pri-
vate citizens revolting 
against a bloated, bureau-
cratic government which 
was more interested in bul-

lying its subjects and picking pockets than defending 
ci~ns' rights and freedoms. 

The grievances listed two centuries ago echo eerily 
in the rising voice of present-day armed America. Al-
though some of what passes for truth iii certain militia 
circles could easily parlay into an Oscar-winning 
Oliver Stone film which would easily eclipse any of 
his prior conspiracy-theory movies, there is enough 
veracity in certain groups' rhetoric to merit a closer 
examination. Even a cursory analysis of the U.S. Con-
stitution leaves one with a disturbing conclusion: With 
the possible exception of the Third Amendment, ev-
ery single freedom guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is, 
to one extent or another, often violated by our current 
federal government. I leave as an exercise for the reader 
to study our Constitution and discover what these vio-
lated rights are. Knowing the apathetic stupor of most 
college-age nitwits, l suspect the library's copy of the 
Constitution will sit quietly on its shelf gathering dust, 
while hot-and empty-headed dissenters give their two 
cents through iII-w~tten hate mail. 

Linda Thompson, an attorney who founded the 
American Justice Federation (kicking some putative 
dirt on the shoes of those who dismiss militia groups 
as sexist), recently called for an armed march to Wash-
ington, D.C. to indict Congress with treason. While 
outrageous shenanigans like this are more than likely 
PR stunts, the charge oftreason may not be completely 
out of order. A congressman who raises his right hand 
and swears to defend the Constitution - and then votes 
for ill-conceived measures such as the Brady Bill and

Monday, May 8, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

CHANG'S RIGHT-WING ANTICS AND IGNORANCE 
Editor: 

In the last issue of the Guard-
ian, Peter Chang wrote a racist at-
tack ("Hypocrisy Alive and Well 
in Voz Fronteriza " ) not only 
against Voz Fronteriza - the 
Chicano newspaper of UCSD -
but against the Chicano commu-
nity at VCSD and Mexicanos in 
general. 

Chang has been trying to make 
a name for himself on campus with 
his right-wing antics such as sup-
porting Proposition 187 and the 
California Civil Rights Initiative. 
It is a waste of time, ink and spit to 
even consider his remarks, but to 
someone capable of critical 
thought, his attack merits an analy-
sis in order to place it into perspec-
tive. 
..... HIstorIaII 

It is a sad thing when energy 
must be spent convincing people 
that oppression exists when it 
should be spent combating oppres-
sion. Chang, who really should 
know better, questions our under-
standing that the U.S. government 
is ultimately responsible for drug 
trafficking in Mexican barrios. By 
dismissing it as "stupidity" and 
"wildly outrageous," Chang ex-
poses his ignorance of history. 
Throughout history oppressive im-
perial governments have imposed 
drugs on oppressed communities to 
undermine their ability to resist co-
lonial domination. 

trade." Part of this free trade in-
cluded the right for Europeans to 
sell opium to the Chinese masses, 
at which point, thousands of "le-
gal" opium dens were set up 
throughout China. This European-
sponsored and organized opium 
trade created a national drug ad-
diction - millions of Chinese 
became dope addicts. 

Chang liquidates the racist char-
acter of Proposition 187, claiming 
that Mexicanos are here only to de-
fraud the U.S. government, refus-
ing to recognize the terrible exploi-
tation of Mexican labor and extreme 
poverty which exists in my commu-
nity. Chang conveniently forgets the 
history of U.S. policy imposed on 
Chinese laborers: 

In the mid-to-Iate 1800s, thou-
sands of Chinese were brought to 
the United States as "coolies" (feu-
dal slaves) to work on the railroads. 
After the railroads were completed, 
many were deported and Chinese 
were banned from coming to the 
country under the Chinese Exclu-
sion Act of 1882. Going even fur-
ther, Chinese were forced to do 
only labor which white men would 
not do - working in restaurants, 
laundries, small vegetable stands, 
as domestic workers, etc. Thus, the 
infamous roots of "Chinese Laun-
dries," "Chinese Markets" and 
"Chinese Restaurants" are ex-
posed. 

Of course, Chang sees no par-
allel between these historical facts

pretty. 

Chang applies a social 
Darwinistic smoke screen to his rac-
ist attacks by stating, "I n a modem, 
capitalist society, effort and talent 
and a touch of luck are all anyone 
needs." 

Yet, when the Chinese at-
tempted to work outside those jobs 
limited to them by white society, 
they were brutally attacked. The 
ancestors of Pete Wilson and Bill 
Clinton openly committed every 
sort of crime which could be com-

where the Chinese had established 
fishing villages (San Francisco, 
Santa Barbara, San Pedro, San Di-
ego, etc.), their boats and homes 
were burned down by "white pa-
triots. " 

Chang totally lets the vicious 
character of U.S. history off the 
hook as the social and historical 
force behind the intense poverty and 
misery experienced by the majority 
of non-white people in this country. 
Maybe Peter should take an ethnic 
studies class or two. 

On the question of conspiracies, 
Chang obviously feels that these 
historical racts are mere accidents 
which could never occur again. 
The governors, senators, generals, 
labor bosses and presidents who 
held conferences to develop plans 
to stop the "yellow horde" (as it 
was described in all major U.S. 
newspapers at the time) had noth-
ing to do with any conspiracy 
against Chinese or other Asian 
people - Uncle Sam is well 
known throughout the world for his 
love and benevolence to all non-
white people. 

History has proved over and 
over again that when white soci-
ety perceives Asian communities 
as a threat, they are just as easy a 
target as Mexicans are today. 
Maybe then, Chang will not be so 
quick to wave his little American 
flag. 

their attacks against Asians - as is 
the case in other areas like L.A., 
Chicago, New York - is that, at 
least for the moment, these same 
racists are more frightened by Mexi-
cans and Africans. 
..... 1 ........... 

Chang wrote that the Voz is a 
"Chicano Victimhood Rag," paint-
ing La Raza as criminals and wel-
fare crooks, and calling Chicanos 
on campus who read the Voz stu-
pid and opportunistic. These are 
things which would get anyone a 
righteous ass kicking anywhere 
else. Peter Chang expresses igno-
rance and intolerance, but because 
he is in an environment of educa-
tion and tolerance, he gets away 
with writing racist, KKK-style re-
marks without suffering the conse-
quences. 

It is obvious that Chang is noth-
ing but a punk, and if he wants to 
be white so badly, he should just 
change his name to Peter Chump. 
Where does he get the nerve to go 
around attacking a newspaper 
which cares enough for its commu-
nity that it attempts to struggle, to 
the best of its ability, for the rights 
of an historically oppressed 
people? 

The really sad thing is that righ-
teous .nd courageous Asians on 
campus don't clean house with 
clowns like this, and we, as 
Chicanos, are forced to expose trai-
tors like Peter Chump. 

In the 1800s, England, France 
and the United States forced 
China at gun point to buy prod-
ucts from them, and called it "free

6 OPINION 

RESISTANCE: 
Historic right to bear 
arms is under siege 
Continued from pc. 4 
monstrous hikes in federal spending in 
an age of debt and foreign aid to tin-
pot terrorist dictators - might rightly 
be convicted. On the other hand, 0p-
position to anned zealots points out 
that a majority of the militias often rally 
around dubious heroes like self-iden-
tified white-supremacist Randy 
Weaver and Waco's most famous deni-
zen, David Koresh. We are faced with 
• question: Do we really wlnt to de-
fend the rights of gun-toting racists? 

To answer uno" is to follow the 
dangerous line of thinking penned suc-
cinctly by a Nazi concentration camp 
survivor, who wrote: "When they 
came for the Gypsies, I was not a 
Gypsy, and I was silent. When they 
came for the Jews, I told them I was a 
Protestant, and was silent. When they 
came for the Communists, I remained 

silent When they came for me, there 
was nobody left to raise a voice." 

As repugnant as the racist views 
espoused by some paramilitary grou~ 
are, they act, in a sense, IS a buffer to 
the rights of the rest of America. A to-
talitarian government never targets the 
mainstream IS the whipping boy for 
stripping away rights, It is in the 
gradual whittling away of "extrem-
ists" in the name of "public safety" 
which secures its power base. Like 
canaries which tested the qual ity of air 
in the coal mines of old, it is extrem-
ists who test the strength of liberty. 

The Nazis seized the burning of the 
Reichtag in Gennany IS an excuse to 
declare martial law and eliminate due 
proces1. Fifty years later, a building is 
leveled, and the government wants its 
citizens to relinquish their rights to 
facilitate "public safety," Let us re-
member the lesson of Nazi Gennany 
- it would be I pity if we were to 
make the mistake of allowing the 
Oklahoma City bombing to become 
another Reichtag.

DRINK: Program 
provides cab fare to 
intoxicated students 
ContInued from ..... 1 
the level of alcohol use, the effects 
of alcohol on students' behavior and 
the frequency of driving while un-
der the influence. 

Forty-live percent of those polled 
said they had driven a car after drink-
ing and 26 percent said they had 
driven while "feeling drunk. "Thirty-
six percent of the respondents said 
they drank on I weekly basis, while 
17 percent of those polled said they 
never consumed alcohol. 

"Obviously these numbers need 
to be addressed," said Stephanie 
Baca, a member of Creating Re-
sponsible Alcohol Service and Habi-
tat (CRASH), UCSO's Initiative 
team. "We think [the results) might 
have to do with peer pressure. If 
people knew the actual amount of 
how much people drink, they 
wouldn't do it." 

The SDIIDI survey found that 
while only 36 percent of the respon-
dents drink on a weekly basis, 70 
percentofthose polled believed that 
the average student drank at least 
that frequentl y. 

"If we can get these stereotypes 
taken care of, people won't feel like 
they have to drink," said Baca. 

Project members say their goal is 
not to prohibit drinking, but to de-
emphasize Ihe role of alcohol at 
parties. 

"Havi ng non-alcoholic drinks and 
food is a plus," said UCSD team-
member Sarah Hartman, "Some stu-
dents say Ihey go loa party and don 't 
have fun because ii's a II cenlered 
around one keg of beer." 

CRASH members said they plan 
to work for responsible drinking 
Ihrough educational workshops with 
campus organizalions. They have 
also proposed holding a "responsible 
beverage service" workshop wilh 
employeesal Porter's Pub and Bull's 
Eye Tavern. 

CRASH hopes to promote re-
sponsible drinking by showing the 
negative consequences of excessive 
alcohol consumption and driving 
while under the influence. 

"We need to educate students 
about the secondary effects of drink-
ing and driving, and the legal effects 
of drinking and driving," said 
Hartman, who estimated that a DUI 
penalty could costas much as $3,500. 

Hartman said she believes the 
group's message will be effective 
because it will be conveyed by fel-
low students. 

"We're their peers," said 
Hartman. "We're showing them the 
liabilities of alcohol consumption." 

In an effort to curb the percent of 
students who drive while intoxi-

• cated, USD's Initiative team has 
established a taxi-ride program. 
Under the plan, students can take a 
cab ride home from any location in 
San Diego and the university will 
front the costs. 

"The student has two weeks 10 
pay Ihe university back for half of 
the cab fare," said Brueckner. 

According to Brueckner, the de-
mand for such a program at USD is 
especially high because there are no 
drinking establishments within 
walking distance from the school. 

"We've received tremendous 
support," sa id Brueckner. "Although 
drinking and college life do go hand-
in-hand, students are glad not to 
have to drive home," 

SOliDI's l8-month program, 
sponsored by the California Office 
of Traffic Safety, will conclude at 
the end of this school year.

TESAK: 
ContInued from pce 1 

Her bluff worked and Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson called Tesak 
in for a meeting during the first 
week of Fall Quarter. She fed him 
the whole story, right down to the 
cost to lay the water pipes. Four 
days later, two vice chancellors, un-
der Atkinson's instruction, sent let-
ters to the Financial Aid and Hous-
ing and Dining Services Commit-
tees directing them to make afford-
able housing their top priority. 

"I think [the chancellor's ap-
proval) was the key." Tesak said. 
"Within two months we had an 
agreement. " 

A year of frustration ended with 
a single nod from the chancellor. 
Next year, almost 50 students will 
pay only $160 a month to live in the 
Mesa Apartments, some of the most 
sought-after graduate student hous-
ing at UCSD. 

The UCSD Guardian Monday, May 8, 1995 

Affordable housing may be the 
crown-jewel of Tesak 's two years 
as A.S. president. The university 
was never exactly opposed to the 
idea of affordable housing, but there 
seems to be little doubt that it re-
quired Tesak 's constant pressure for 
the administration to bring it tp frui-
tion. Former A.S. President Carla Tesak Uk .. time out from pac:kin, her office to take car. of .ome la.t minute bu.ln ....

said Assistant. Director of Student 
Government Randy Woodard. 

Recently elected A.S. Vice-Presi-
dent Administrative Jennifer Nicoll 
was pleased with the outcome of 
affordable housing, and added that 
it "was mostly Carla's work." 

EvenAS. President Naomi Falk, 
who is very critical of the council's 
record over the last year. listed af-
fordable housing as a "pretty big" 
success. 

A L.onC W.y From Hom, 
Born and raised in El Salvador, 

Tesak moved to the United States in 
1991. when she enrolled at UCSD. 
Despite a five-year stay in the United 
States in the late '70s and early '80s 
to avoid EI Salvador's raging civil 
war, Tesak said she experienced 
cu Iture shock w hen she arrived here 
to begin classes.

CAMPAIGN PROMISES ... BEFORE & AFTER 
Carta Tesak set several goals for her administration during the 

Guardian editorial board interview prior to last year's election. Below is 
a look at how well she kept those promises. 

PROMISE 
To push for A.S. au-
tonomy. 

To create affordable 
on-campus hous!n&. 

To protect students' 
prtyacy by blockln&

. . . . . . . . . 

OUTCOME 
She pushed, but despite forging a new au-
tonomy agreement with the UCSD administra-
tion, the deal fell through when lawyers for the 
UC OffICe of the President ·slashed· the pre>-
posal. Tesak was forced to abandon the au-
tonomy Issue. 

It took the better part of two years, but Tesak 
kept her promise. Next year, 20 units at the 
spacious Mesa Apartments will be opened to 
students who don't qualify for financial aid 
grants but who must take out loans to pay for 
school. Students will pay only $160 a month in 
rent 

Starting next year, ail new students will receive 
a random nine-diglt number Instead of their 
Social Security number. Current students can 
receive a random number free of c:harIt. The 
administration will pay the $50.000 cost of 
reprogrammlnc the university·, computers .

sioner of aca-
demic affairs-on a slate with then-
Vice President Administrative 
Randolph Siwabessy. who was run-
ning for president. 

However, the night before the 
members of the slate were planning 
to post all of their signs. placards 
and other publicity, the person who 
was supposed to run for vice presi-
dent administrative bailed out. 

"[She] kind of had a nervous 
breakdown and decided she couldn't 
do il.. .• " Tesak said. "So then ev· 
eryone looked at me and 1 said, 'No 
way. you're not going to do this .. . .' 
, really didn't like this idea." 

When she arrived at school the 
next day, all the publicity signs on 
campus proclaimed her as Ihe slate's 
nominee for vice president admi nis-
trative. 

Having lillie choice. she agreed 
to run, but only after Siwabessy 
agreed to bring her up to speed on 
what her new job would entail. In 
the early May general election. 
Siwabessy and Tesak were voted 
into office. 

"Randolph promised that he 
would help me, [that] he would show 
me all the ropes." Tesak said. 

But a few days after the election. 
evidence surfaced that Siwabessy 
had not paid his fees for the past 
quarter and was academically ineli-
gible even if he had been enrolled-
both clear violations of A.S. by-
laws. He was forced out and Tesak 
was made interim president. 

"I was basically like. ·Shit. what 
do I do now?' I did not know what to

actually," she said. 

Facing the preparation of the 
executive budget. which she had 
never even seen before. and the 
stalled co-op negotiations. Tesak 
started gathering information. 

"I asked a lot of questions the 
first two months. I was up [in my 
office] all the time." she said. "All 
my other life kind of stopped. All 
dating stopped. that's for sure." 

Though she had lillie experience 
when she was thrown into the presi-
dential position. Tesak kept the stu-
dent government afloat. 

"To say that [the A.S.] had a 
legitimacy problem at that time 
would certainly be an understate· 
ment .. .. " said -

her two years in office. she has a 
lengthy list of accomplishments -
enough for Woodard to deem her 
one of the top-five presidents in the 
history of the A.S. 

"I think she's had an agenda, and 
I think she's succeeded at meeting 
that agenda," Woodard said. 

"Carla knew how to take a stand 
more than. maybe. anyone' 've ever 
met ... ," added Barnes, who served 
as Tesak's vice president adminis-
trative for two terms. "She guided 
this council these past two years. 
and , think her record speaks for 
itself. "

her campaign promises. The co-ops

tant issue everto face the council-
A.S. autonomy - is indefinitely 
stalled. After a year of negotiations. 
Chancellor Atkinson agreed to an 
increased level of autonomy for the 
board. only to have the document 
"slashed" by · university lawyers, 
according to Tesak. 

"[The UC lawyers) sent back a 
document that wasn't worth keep-
ing." she said. The A.S. has refused 
to sign the new agreement. 

Falk. however, is extremely criti-
cal of even the original version of 
the autonomy agreement. "It didn't 
provide for student aulonomy or for 
A.S. to incorporate in any way," she 
said. 

According to Falk. the council 
under Tesak 's leadership was effec-
tive at addressing some issues. but 
lacked a substantial activist agenda 
and adequate student involvement. 

Overall, Falk gave last year's 
A.S. a two on a scale of one to 10. 
although she added that its efforts 
varied depending on the issue. 
A lucc •• IfII • ....." 

Beyond questions of how effec-
live the AS. has been over the last 
two years, however, is how well 
positioned it is to tackle new issues 
in the future. The level of student 
involvement, the relationship with 
the administration and the cred-
ibility of the council among the 
student body are all important in 
putting the last two years in per-
spective. 

When 23-percenl voter turnout 
is cause for celebration, it is clear 
that one of the largest problems fac-
ing the AS. is student apathy. 

"The AS., for some reason .. . 
has been unable to .. . incorporate 
students into our studenl govern-
ment," said Barnes. While the coun-
cil has made strides over the last 
couple of years, he added, "1 think 
we have a long way to go." 

Tesak lists apathy as the greatest 
failure of her tenure. "You get to a 
point where you run up against a 
wall," she said. "We did ... happy 
hours, we did info nights, we did 
barbecues. And still. free food is the 
only way to get students to come 
out." 

Falk was critical of Tesak's ef-
forts to fight student apathy, and 
said that she hopes to address the 
problem duringherpresidency. "My 
agenda needs to come from outside. 
it needs to come from the stu-
dents .... " she said. "I don't think 
students are apathetic, I just think 
they don't know what's going on." 

Falk has a number of proposals 
to increase student involvement, 
including town meetings and a more 
active public relations department. 
Yet. others question how successful 
such efforts will be. 

Although Nicoll shares Falk's 
enthusiasm for bringing more stu-
dent input into A.S. policy-making. 
she added that"1 don't think [in my 
time on the council] we will ever see 
a student body that is really respon-
sive to campus politics." 

According to critics both on and 
off the council. one <,>f the most 
important reasons for the lack of 
student involvement is that the A.S. 
still lacks credibility among the stu-
dent body. Tesak's work, while ef-
fective in many areas, has still failed 
to change most students' image of 
the A.S. as a waste of space. 

Nicoll lists that credibility gap as 
oae of the chief failures of the A.S. 
over the last year. "I think tbe AS. 
still has a Ion8 way to go in that 
department," she said. 

"The problem with the,A.S ... . is 
not so much credibility with the ad-
ministration ... but with the stu· 
dents." agreed Woodard. 

Rather than attempt to use stu-
dent activism to push for change. as 
many of her predecessors have done, 
Tesak instead cultivated relation-
ships within the administration to 
push her agenda. 

Upon taking office. Tesak "es-
tablished immediately a good work-
ing relationship with ... the powers 
that be." according to Woodard. 

Her efforts were appreciated by 
administrators. "I felt very good 
about the relationship." said Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Jo-
seph Watson. '" hope it lays a good 
foundation [for futur.e coopera-
tion]. " 

The UCSD Guardian 

However. Watson acknowledges 
that the comfortable relationship was 
also due to the more benign issues 
brought to the table by the council. 
"In the past, we've had some issues 
which were, by nature. very conten-
tious ... ," he said. "We didn ' t have 
those this time." 

The result has been a record of 
achievement, but not without com-
promise. Falk and others have been 
critical of the relationship which 
involved the softening of student 
demands. 

Promising to take a "hard line," 
Falk said that under her presidency 
"this is going to become a much 
more advocacy-oriented council." 

Nicoll. however. viewedTesak's 
methods as essentially positive. "The 
only way to get anything done on 

this campus is 10 make connections 
with the administration." she said. 
"It really. really worked to the stu-
dents' advantage." 
Only n .... Will Tel. 

Much of what Tesak accom-
plished can be attributed to her two-
year stint in the presidency. It is the 
first time in UCSD's history that a 
president has served for more than 
one term. 

According to Tesak. the extra 
year allowed her to understand how 
the university works and then pur-
sue her goals within that frame-
work. 

Normally. Tesak said, "Right 
when you're getting a really good 
hang of it and you know who's who 
and who to talk to. you're out. And 
then the next person takes about 30

steps back ... so you're basically at a 
standstill. " 

And regardless of any of her ac-
complishments or failures, it is not 
clear if the past two years indicate 
that the A.S. will become a force to 
be reckoned with in university 
policy-making. 

Falk aptly points out that the 
"biggest criticism [of the AS.] is 
that it is a body that allocates money 
and that's it." 

While Falk added that the criti-
cism was accurate for this year, in 
the final analysis, Tesak delivered 
on many of her campaign prom-
ises. 

Yet her goals were fairly mod-
est, and it remains to be seen if the 
AS. will build on those accomplish-
ments in the next several years.

ByTeny Lew 
Staff Writer 

Guardian staff writer Peter 
Chang rccei'ved an anonymous death 
threat last weekend in response to 
his commentary "Hypocrisy Alive 
and Well in Voz Fronleriza, " which 
criticized Voz Fronleriza and 
Chicano activism in last Thursday's 
GUilrdian. 

The male caller left two meso 
sages on Chang's answering mao 
chine. The first, at 10:22 p.m. Fri· 
day, attacked Chang's criticism of 

Voz Fronleriza and threatened 
Chang's safety. 

"We know where you live," the 
caller said. "We're gonna nail your 
ass, puIO." He continued to threaten 
Chang, concluding with, "Watch 
your back, motherfucker." 

The second message,at9:15 a.m. 
Saturday, said, "Hey homeboy, look 
out for the drive· by. " 

In response to the phone call, 
Voz Fronteriza Editor Harry Barra 
said, "We would like to disassociate 
ourselves from the death threat, but 

people need to understand that rac· 
ist comments will create reactions 
like thaI. People in the future need to 
be more careful about what they 
say." 

The UCSD Police Department 
has recorded six instances of threat· 
ening phone calls to both professors 
and students since April. 

Because Chang lives off cam· 
pus, the incident falls under the ju· 
risdiction of the San Diego Police 
Department (SDPD): Chang said he 
will meet SDPD detectives today. Students who will be at UCSD for at least 3 years with the 

ability to prioritize workload, make order out of chaos, have 
high levels of accuracy, ability to work independenUyo and 
possess enthusiasm and initiative.

The varsity-four crew captured 
a first-place finish in a time of 
8:43.2. In the petite division, the 
varsity-eight squad took home sec-
ond place among smaller crews in a 
time of 7:53. That result was good 
enough for ninth'-place overall. 

8un8hine 8t@re Reprint 8peci~ 

The novice "B" rowers earned 
third place, slipping to fellow UCs, 
Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. The 
result was admirable considering 
their troubles on the course. After a 
row popped out of place, the cox-
swain made a quick decisi<'n to keep 
rowing. The novice" A" boat, on the 
other hand, garnered a disappoint-
ing sixth-place finish. 

"It has been an up and down 
year," Vallerga said. "We're eager 
to see what happens in two weeks."

of dollars from TV ads to disappear 
along with Jordan? Michael just 
came back; the Bulls can't lose now. 
Whether or not M.J. fouled the Hor-
nets' Hersey Hawkins late in the 
game is irrelevant. (Jordan even said 
after the game, "I probably got his 
whole arm.") Stop crying, Charlotte. 
As long as "Mugsy the Midget" is

Playoff Summary, Shaq will 
have more dunks than free throws 
made; Jordan wHltravel 50 times a 
game and will end up with one per-
sonal foul; Dennis Rodman will dye 
his hair and receive more technicals; 
and one of these eight teams wiII 
win it all.

second year student with a double 
major in Political Science and 
History, and he is also contem· 
plating a future in law. His main 
reason for wanting to serve as an 
intern on Capitol Hill lies in }tjs 
vested interest in learning ·how 
politics works.H His experiences 
within his fraternity and college 
council have taught him the buics of 
how a beauracracy operates and 
how to better associate with people 
in this beauracracy. He would also 
like to learn about the larger 
beauracracy at the national level, 
and to get Han inside view of how 
[politics) works, and see if it's 
something that I want to do. H At the 
present, his overall goal for his 
intemship lies in his Hbope to make 
a difference. H 

Kalinda and Justin both 
demonstrate a desire to tap into the 
world of politics. Their advice for 
future students wishing to follow in 
tier footsteps of political adventure 
is actually quite straightforward, as 
Justin says, ·Iearn about politics at 
the college level, [and) how campus 
politics works. H As Kalinda states, 
"look at people who are older and 
find what interests you and how to 
get there ... ask people a lot of 
questions. H Sound advice from two 

U P stage for an exciting end of the season. 
With very strong 

showings in Over the Line and 
Sand Volleyball, Sigma Chi has 
moved ahead of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon in the battle for the IFC 
Sports Banner. The lead of 423-
420 is almost as close as it can get 
as the two fralemities gear up for 
the final two tournaments of the 
year, Inner tube Waterpolo and 
Softball. In third place, and still 
clinging to life is TKE with 383 
points. 

Going into the quarter, 
IAE had built up a 47 point lead 
over second place TKE and a 67 
point lead over third place IX. 
That changed two weeks ago 
when the on tournament was 
played at Mariner's Point. Led 
by a first place finish from their 
team of Josh Dibianca, Chris 
Franke, and Nghia Nguyen, IX 
won the overall tournament, 
earning them 50 points. 

Congratulations 
The ladies of Alpha Chi 
Omega and Delta Delta 
Delta put on a volleyball 
clinic at ISVT. The Alpha 
Chi's made it to the Sweet Sixteen 
and the Tri-Delts to the Round of 
Eight. Great job!

THE [YnI[ 
SEANRAHIMI 

NB.A Playoffs: 
It's Fantastic! 

It's NBA playoff time, and 
it's a time of "walking the 
walk" and "talking the talk." I 
admit, I'm burned out after 
watching so many first-round 
games on TBS, TNT and any 
other Turner station on TV. 
However, now the pretenders 
are gone. Now, only eight real 
basketball teams remain. Here's 
my take on the whole thing ... 

Tritons Living on a Prayer 

First-Round Chokes. 
Seattle. What more can I say? 
Kurt Cobain's suicide has 
obviously rubbed off on the 
Supersonic r'ayers. Once 
again, Seattle fell in the first 
round, even though it suppos-
edly had the most talent in the 
league. Maybe they lost 
because it rains too much up 
there. In any case, they oughta 
take the "Super" out of sonies. 

And then there's Utah - a 
team like Susan Lucci. She 's 
cute and all, puts in some good 
regular-season work, but when 
the time comes to take home a 
Daytime Emmy, she might as 
well be Suzanne Sommers. 
Utah has two stars and 50-plus 
wins, but when it comes to 
finishing, it pulls up lame.

HOPING: UCSD ballplayers 
can only wait anxiously for 
an NCAA playoff berth 
By Sean Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

The 1995 UCSD baseball season came to 
an anti-climactic end Saturday afternoon, as 
the scheduled doubleheader against Cal State 

San Bernardino was canceled 
due to poor field conditions. 

The Triton players were out 
on the field early in the morn-
ing trying to soak up the wa-
ter puddles with cups, but to 
no avail - the careers of 
seven UCSD ballplayers came 
to an end. However, a faint 

glimmer of hope remains, and it is best sum-
marized in one word: playoffs. 

UCSD still has a chance to participate in 
the post-season. As far as rules go, two teams 
are selected from the west. The champion of 
that area is automatically in, and one more 
team is then voted in by the NCAA Division 
III selection committee. 

"We are probably not going to the 
playoffs ... and 'probably' means only about 
a 1 O-percent chance," Triton senior catcher 
AI DelFavero said. "We didn 't have the best 
record, so we have to get voted in." 

The Tritons' final record of 23-12 could 
have been hetter, but UCSD lost a lot of clo e 
games. The selection committee will pick the 
team with the best record, while considering 
"close-game" team records as a tie-breaker. 

Predictions. With a pitiful 
display of choking, the New 
York "Bricks" handed Reggie 
Miller the "full-fledged trash-
talker" title yesterday. Up six 
points with 15 seconds left in 
the game, the Knicks lost by 
two when Miller sank two 
three-pointers and also tallied 
a steal to aid the Pacer cause. 
Miller then claimed that he and 
his teammates came to the Big 
Apple in·search of a sweep! If 
I could shoot smack like him, 
I'd be making six-figure 
checks. I sat there and read 
Miller's mouth as he yelled at 
Spike Lee, "Shut up, you 
midget. Go direct a commer-
cial." Smack or no smack, my 
prediction is that Indiana will 
win in five. 

The Tritons' .eason h_ been 8 hlt .. nd-ml .. affair. UCSD' •• Um playoff hopes ride mostly 
on Its lat ... .on, slx-Jame wlnnlnlstreak, which raised Its record to 23-13 on the year. 

"We might get some honorary mention," 
senior second baseman Eric Quandt said. "It's 
a long shot right now." 

It's Miller Time for Women Rowers 
TUNE-UP: The UCSD women conquer the Miller Cup, while the men travel to Newport Beach 

As for the other teams, the 
San Antonio Spurs are going to 
have a tougb time against the 
Lakers because ... Hell, I was 
delirious for a second there. 
Sorry to all you Laker fans out 
there, but unless Magic and 
Kareem come back - along 
with Dr. J and Bird and Wilt -
Los Angeles is history. 

The Jordan Rules. I feel 
bad for the Charlotte Hornets, I 
really do. They had to play the 
Bulls, Jordan, NBC and the 
NBA - all in the first round. 
Did anyone think that NBC 
would allow all those millions

This weekend marked the final 
tune-up for both the men's and 
women's crews before the west 

coast rowing 
event - the Pa-
cific Coast Row-

ing Champion-

in two weeks. 

The Triton 
squads took the 
divide and con-

quer approach, as the women 
headed for the Miller Cup in Ma-
rina Del Ray, and the men traveled 
to Newport Beach for the 30th An-
nual Newport Invite Regatta. 

For the men's varsity-eight boat, 
the race was a learning experience. 
After falling to UC Davis a few 
weeks ago, UCSD's strategy was to

could hold the top spot. 

"We needed to use this race as a 
training tool," Head Men's Coach 
Doug Thiemann said. "All the fast 
crews were here, and I 
thought it would be a 
difficult race to win." 

The competition was 
top-notch, and the Tri-
