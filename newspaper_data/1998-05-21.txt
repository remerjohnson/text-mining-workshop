DemonstratIon Ends 
In Street Closure 
BERKELEY - A Saturday 
night gathering of bicyclists 
at the downtown Berkeley 
BART station to "Reclaim 
the Streets" ended in protest-
ers' seizure of Telegraph 
Avenue and an assemblage of 
riot gear-clad police officers. 
The hundreds of protester 
first lit a mattress on fire and 
then overtook the inter ection 
of Telegraph Avenue and 
Ha te Street with the inten-
tion of turning the street into 
thei r "playground." Berkeley 
police, wearing riot helmets 
and holding batons, cordoned 
off the demonstration area by 
setting up rows of officers on 
the edge of the group. There 
were no arrests, but at least 
one business was damaged.

Students Protest 
UCLA Inauguration 
LOS ANGELES - Over 300 
UCLA students, including 
USAC President Kandea 
Mosley, protested the inaugu-
ration of Chancellor Albert 
Carnesale at a demonstration 
last Friday. The students 
marched into Royce Hall as 
Carnesale was being inaugu-
rated and shouted slogans 
calling for the return of affir-
mative action. The protesters 
demanded that Carnesale 
issue a statement of non-
compliance with Proposition 
209. Since the release of 
admissions statistics for next 
fall, Carnesale has said he is 
committed to maintaining 
diversity at the university 
without taking a stand for or 
against Proposition 209.

Native Americans,

in the foil. 

This fall's entering fresh-
man class, the first to be 
se lected without the u e of 
affi rmative-action criteria, will 
have 307 underrepresented-
racial minority students - 27 
percent less than last year -
according to data released 
Wednesday. 

Joseph Watson, vice chancel-
lor of student affairs, said that 
university officials predicted the 
drop in such students two years 
ago. 

"We undertook a number of 
initiatives, one to try to 
increase our applications of 
admissible students and sec-
ondly to try to increase our 
yield of those we admilled," 
Watson said. "I think on both 
those wc ' ve shown some suc-

cess, but clearly a lot more has 
to be done to compe.nsate for 
the adverse impacts of Prop. 
209 and SP- I." 

While the number of Latino 
and Filipino students who plan 
to allend UCSD in the fall 
increased compared to last year, 
the number of students from 
underrepresented groups 
decreased. Native Americans, 
African Americans and Mexican 
Americans make up only 9.5 
percent of the 3,600 freshmen 
who accepted offers of admis-
sion. 

Watson said that having a 
diversified student body is a pri -
ority at UCSD. Therefore, 
administrators began an aggres-
sive outreach effort to persuade 
underrepresented students to 
accept UCSD's offers of admis-
sion. 

"The campus made a major 
t;ffort to recruit those who were 
admitted," Watson said. "Clearly 
we were able to have some 
impact, because the decrease [in 
admitted students accepting, 27 
percent] is less than the admis-
sions decrease [40 percent). Our 
recruitment efforts had a posi-
tive impact because our number 
of applications among underrep-
resented students went up. 

"If we had been able to 
apply the same selection criteria 
as we did the previous year, we 
would have had an increase of 
about 13 percent of underrepre-
sented students admitted to 
UCSD," Watson added.

Admit 
Process ~ 
DATA: A record 28,002 
high school seniors 
applied to UCSD 
By Marc Comer 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD's complicated admis-
sions process has been the subject 
of much controversy, especially 
after the elimination this year of 
affirmative-action criteria. To shed 
light on the often-misunderstood 
process, three UCSD admissions 
officials met Friday with the 

News Analysis 
Guardian. 

"We feel there is some confu-
sion on campus in certain quarters 
about what the admissions policy is 
and how we process admissions 
here," said Richard Backer, assis-
tant vice chancellor for enrollment 
management. 

Mae Brown, director of admis-
sions and outreach, said that 
UCSD's admissions process con-
sists of many steps. Backer, Brown 
and Dorothy Kane, assistant direc-
tor of admissions, dissected these 
steps. 

This year, over 28,000 freshman 
applied to UCSD. Their applica-
tions were first received and dis-
tributed to the campus by a central 
processor in Northern California. 

"After preliminary eligibility 
was established and identified by 
the central processor, copies of the 
applications were sent to UCSD,"

ASE/UAW Members Deliberate Possibility of a TA Strike 
DECISION: Result of 
vote will be announced 
in two weeks 
By Michael Salorlo 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD's teaching assistants 
(TAs), tutors, readers and research 
assistants are currently deciding 
whether to strike in protest of the 
administration 's refu al to grant 
collective-bargaining rights to their 
union , the AssoCiation of Student 
EmployeeslUnited Auto Workers 
(ASFJUAW). 

Last year, ASEfUAW members 
went on strike twice - from May.7 
to 9 and from Nov. 19 to Nov. 22. 
The strikers demanded collective-
bargaining right and recognition 
as full -time employees. 

ASE/UA W members met 
Monday to discuss and vote on the 
pos ible strike. The results of the 
vote will be announced in two 
weeks. 

Dan Johnston, an ASEIUAW 
staff member, aid the teaching 
assistants are contemplating trik-
ing because, as in previous strikes, 
they want the university to recog-

ni ze their union's legitimacy. 
Johnston said t~at graduate-stu-

dent TA , unlike the undergraduate 
TA who mainly assist in science 
and engineering classes, depend 
entirely upon TA salaries to support 
them elves. As a result, he said that 
the university should recognize 
them as full -time employees 
instead of part-time workers. 

"For the mo t part, teaching 
assistant in-die science and engi-
neering departments are undergrad-
uates with other financial 
resources," Johnston said. "For 
most graduate teaching assistants, 

this is their sole means of support. 
Many are also starting their own 
families and find it difficult to not 
receive [adequate] pay for work 
performed." 

Johnston also said that he 
believe the university'S explana-
tion for why it will not recognize 
the union is flawed. 

'The university claims that it 
would destroy the mentorship inter-
action between graduate student 
and faculty," Johnston said. "On the 
contrary, most faculty have been 
supportive of this movement.

Chancellor Robert Dynes announced in a campus-

wide electronic message that he would appoint a com-
mittee to propose a policy to allow the views of the 
UCSD community to be represented in the process of 
selecting a speaker for alk:ampus commencement. 

Dynes wrote that he expected a plan from the com-
mittee by the end of the academic year so that it can be 
implemented for the commencement in June 1999. 

According to the message, the committee will be 
comprised of the current and former A.S. Council presi-
dents, the current and former Graduate Student 
Association presidents, two college provosts, two stu-
dents from the undergraduate college student councils , 
two faculty members, the president of the Alumni 
Association and Joseph Watson, vice chancellor of stu-

In the message, Dynes acknowledged the controver-
sy in the selection of Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives Newt Gingrich as this year's com-
mencement speaker. Dynes wrote that there was not 
enough time for campus-wide consultation and an 
immediate decision was required in the selection of a

UCSD Undergraduates Recognized for 
Innovative Ideas at Research Conference 
EVENT: Students were 
nominated by professors 
to present their work 
KI-Mln Sung 
Staff Writer 

Ninety undergraduate students 
gathered last Saturday at the 
Faculty Club to present their 
research findings at the II th-annu-
al UCSD Undergraduate Research 
Conference. The conference's pur-
pose was to recognize undergradu-
atc student research and to encour-
agc the further pursuit o f academic 
inquiry. 

"The e)(perience of research is 
something that I think everyone 
should engage in at least once or 
twice in their life so they can 
understand the frustration and 
understand the creative process," 
Chancellor Robert Dynes said. 

Dynes also said that research is 
valuable because of the thought 
process that goes into generating 
new ideas. 

"You're asking questions that 
weren't in the textbooks," Dynes 
said. "You were asking questions 
that people didn't know the 
answers to, that the professors 
couldn't give you the answers to. 

"That's the value of research 
and that's the value of going to a 

research university because you're 
coming up with the next questions 
that nobody knows the answers to," 
Dynes continued. 'That ' s the 
strength of the education at UCSD. 
You 're working with people who 

preliminary result will establi sh a 
model for research in myopia 
(nearsightedness) and glaucoma. 

Even among t the many break-
throughs in research today, few stu-
dents aid they realizcd how many 

are actually in the 
process of generat-
ing the new knowl-
edge." 

Stimulating as 
the process of 
research may be. 
somc students said 
they had to evalu-
ate the difficulties 
undertaking such a 
commitment.

process is fun. but

Gov. Wilson Proposes Giving $108 Million 
In Surplus State Funds to UC System 
BUDGET: University of 
California will receive an 
additional $108 million 
By Ryan Olson 
CoÂ·News Editor 

Gov. Pete Wilson announced 
last week his plans to allocate an 
additional $108 million in state 
general funds to the Univcrsity of 
California for fiscal 1998-99. 

The money would he in addition 
to the extra $175 million Wilson 
promised the university when he 
unveiled his budget plans in 
January. 

According to a statement by UC 
President Richard Atkinson. the 
extra funds will go toward funding 
five different areas . 

First, $23 million will be spent 
to accommodate the 3,200 addi -
tional students who are expected to 
attend UC campuses in thc fall. 
These students were not originally 
anticipated in Wilson 's initial bud-
get proposal. 

Deferred maintenance needs, 
including the repair and replace-
ment of roofs, elevators and heat-
ing and ventilati on systems, will 
cost an additional $23 million in 
one-time funding.

on strike during fall 
and spring last year

" Se ond. the univers ity claims 
that it would have an adverse affec t 
on the quality o f educati on," 
John ton continued . " Once again, 
this makes no en e because if the 
teaching as istants arc gelling paid 
for doing their j b , won ' t the qual-
ity of education be affected in a po -

Anothcr $23 million will be set 
aside for the one-time funding of 
instructional equipment, such as 
laboratory equipment, furniture 
and compl!ters. 

Wi Ison has also allocatcd anoth-
er $10 million for the purchase of 
library materials and supplies. 

Finally, Wilson set $25 million 
aside for the purchase of instruc-
tional tcchnology, such as comput-
ers for classroom s and libraries and 
vidco-conferencing equipment for 
classroom s. 

" I know I speak for the enti re 
uni versity co mmunity and the 
Board of Regents in expressing our 
apprec iation and the gratitude to 
the governor," Atkinson said . 

Wil son's reviscd $75.8 billion 
budget includes a $4.4 billion surplus 
and a $1.6 billion reserve. Wilson 
would increase spending in K - 12 and 
higher education, as well as local 
nood-control projects, the purchase 
of headwaters forest lands, and local 
infrastructure improvements. 

Wil son also expects to use $1 
billion to start reducing the " car 
tax." The an~ual tax cut would 
grow to $3 .6 billion by 2002. 

Wil son attributed the surplus to 
the state's powerful economy, 
which has produced greater rev-

iti ve manncr? The university has 
wasted $1.8 million stalling our 
effort in the courts sincc 1994, 
money wh ich could have been 
invested inlo thc university, lhereby 
improving the quality of education."

enues than were projected while 
the original budget was being 
developed. 

" We've witnessed dramatic 
changes these past seven years." 
Wil son said. " We' ve secn recession 
swept away by recovery. Seven 
years ago, thc challenge was to 
make do with less ." 

In related news, eight 
Democratic state legi slators 
announced yesterday their plan to 
u e the $4.4-billion urplus to elim-
inate student fees at UC and CSU 
campuses . 

The proposal , penned by Sen. 
John Vasconcellos, D -Santa Clara, 
would spend $1.3 billion to abolish 
student fees in 1998-99 and would 
set aside the rest o f the surplus to 
offset fees in future years. 

Legislators supponing the pro-
posal said that UC tuition increases 
since 1990 have placed California's 
public higher-education system out 
of reach for many Californians. 

Ron Low, a spokesman for 
Wil son, said that the governor 
would not support using the enlire 
surplus to eliminate student fees. He 
said the governor is afraid that other 
programs that could be funded out 
of the surplus would have to be sac-
rifi ced to support the proposal. 

'The ASElUAW does not officially 
represent anyone." 

Melman also said he hopes that if 
ASElUAW members decide to 
strike, other graduate students will 
continue working through the strike. 

" I hope that if graduate students 
do vote to strike, they will honor 
their commitment to the university 
and to their own educational objec-
tives," he said. " In thc pa t. the 
majority of teaching 'and research 
assistant have honored that com-
mitment."

Non-Science Departments 
Deserve More Recognition 

Truly, UCSD is shamefully oblivious to the pres-
ence of "giants who walk among us," to evoke the 
words of Literature Professor Ann duCi lie. 

San Diego Mayor Susan Golding officially 
declared May) 5, 1998 to be" herJey Anne Williams 
day" - certain ly not an insignificant commemora-
tion of the remarkable work for which Professor 
Williams is noted. She has written the foreword to 
Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God 
and wrote Dessa Rose - to name just a couple of her 
many achievements. 

Although Williams has been a faculty member at 
UCSD for 25 years, her work has been marginalized 
and eclipsed by UCSD's achievements in science and 
technology - as has the work of numerous other 
remarkable literary giants among us. 

The extraordinary work produced by our depart-
ments in the social sciences, humanities and fine arts 
is evidence enough to refute the claim that UCSD is 
a school notable only for its sciences. Our ethnic 
studies department, for example, employs faculty 
members who produce avant-garde work in their 
field. Furthermore, our campus boasts several 
Pulitzer Prize winners and nominees. 

The ostracism many UCSD students receive as 
non-science majors is both ill-founded and based in 
ignorance; work produced and studied in the social 
sciences and humanities is no less legitimate and 
praiseworthy than that of the sciences. 

Leventhal's Veto was 
Warranted and Necessary 

A.S. President Joe Leventhal recently vetoed the 
nascent Academic Success Program (A.S.P.), arguing 
that the council demonstrated poor judgment in 
amending the A.S. budget to fund the near-$13,OOO 
program. His veto was appropriate, given that the 
council spent a mere 23 minutes and 23 seconds 
debating the item - too short of a time to decide to 
allocate a large amount of the student's monies to a 
program that currently lacks any clear organizational 
structure. 

The council has approved A.S.P' with the stipula-
lion that a charter must be written for the organiza-
tion. However, given that A.S.P. has a tremendous 
amount of council support, there will be no strong 
impetus for the organization and the A.S. to work 
together to produce to a good, well-thought out char-
ter. 

In addition, the potential strengths of A.S.P. -
which were heavily emphasized during the elec-
tion - have lost their luster with the deci ion to 
trim down their budget. The original A.S.P. would 
have been run on $40,000 and would have served 
many UCSD students. The downsized budget 
would only be able to serve a limited amount of 
UCSD student. 

Because their funding would come from student 
fees, this organization would be exclu. ionary in their 
work by not being able to offer s rvice to all of the 
14,700 UCSD students. 

Props and Flops

BAJA DRINKING AGE DOES 
NOT NEED TO BE RAISED 

COMMENTARY: While city officials in Rosarito benevolently intend to increase 
the legal drinking age, the action will likely have a negative effect on tourism 

By Jeffrey M. Barker 
Staff Writer 

"Boo"s and "hiss"es to civic lead-
ers in Rosarito Beach for launching an 
absurd campaign to raise the legal 
drinking age in Baja California from 
18 to 21. Not only is a statewide 
increase to the legal drinking age 
impossible, it is unrealistic and unfa-
vorable to Baja's economy. 

The beach city's seven-member 
council unanimously voted to endorse 
the statewide change. This vote came 
shortly after the week of spring break 
for many American high school and 
college students. During that week in 
Ro arito, 13 Americans were expelled 
from Mexico for being involved in dis-
turbances. 

The absurdity of thi s proposed 
change in the law is that it will have to 
be agreed upon tatcwide - an impos-
sible task. Along with Rosarito, larger 
cities such an Ensenada and Tecate 
would have to agree on the change. 
TIli s al 0 includes Tijuana, whose city 
officials have no plans to push for such 
change. 

Tijuana's economy and livelihood 
lhrive on the 18- to 20-year-old crowd. 
From the lare-night dance clubs and 
bars , to the advertisements from the 
Tijuana board of tourism on local 
radio stations with large teenage audi -
ences - the economy of our neighbor 
across the border seem to have pre-21 
A mericans as its target. 

An hour south of Tijuana, 
Ensenada thirsts for tourists to step off 
the cruise boats that frequently dock 
there. The jacked-up prices on the 
menus of restaurants along the bea h 
arc evidence of this. 

What Rosarito seem to have for-
gotten in light of the spring break 
crowds is lhat not all Americans arc 
from Southern California. During 

What Rosarito seems 
to have forgotten In 
light of the spring 
break crowd. Is that 
not all Americans are 
from Southern 
California. During 
school breaks, 
tourists from San

known to venture Into

party. This I. the same 
phenomenon that

In the law. 
chool break , lOuri t from San 

Franci 0 , the Midwest - even as far 
away as Canada - have been known 

to venture into Mexico in search of a 
party. 

This is the same phenomenon that 
occurs in vacation cities across the 
globe and will continue to occur 
despite any changes in the law. It is 
also independent of the fact that Baja 
benefits greatly, year-round, from 
Southern California's supply of hard-
earned dollars. 

In Tijuana, the search for American 
money goes as far as crooked police 
officers jailing Americans without rea-
son-and then asking for cash as bail. 
Without breaking any laws, a car with 
U.S. license plaLes is easily pulled 
over. A small (or large) fee will keep 
the car from becoming property of 
Mexican authorities. These types of 
stories are endless. 

The problem is not American 
teenagers causi ng trouble in Rosarito. 
The problem is not San Diego disre-
specting Mexico - a country for 
which, it seems, even its citizens don't 
show tremendous respect. 

Perhaps the problem is in the fact 
that the pre-drinking age American 
crowd has to travel to another country 
for dancing and a good time. 

A rt:presentative of Duncan Hunter, 
a San Diego-area congressman who 
fervently patrols lhe U.S.-Mexico bor-
der, for illegal immigration said he 
didn ' t sec the feasibility of enforcing 
the law. Though iL may be a step in the 
right direction, Hunter's representative 
said it would require a large increase 
in law enforcement . 

Hugo Torres Chabcrt, Ro arito's 
mayor, said that this change in law 
would be natural , considering Baja' 
clo eness to al i fornia, where the 
legal drinking age is 21.

LEVENTHAL'S VETOES MOTIVATED By 'SPECIAL INTERFSTS' 
Editor: 

The ideal of the Associated 
Student (A.S.) president is that he 
serves as the chief executive officer 
of the undergraduate population. 
He listens and respects student 
opinions and acts upon their inter-
ests. But, most of all, he represents 
the interest of students to the cam-
pus, state and nation. 

This year's new A.S. president, 
Joe Leventhal, however, has ripped 
these ideals into bits and pieces. With 
a mere 48 percent (1,384 students) 
electing him to his post. Leventhal 
has already displayed immense disre-
spect for democracy and complete 
hypocrisy during his first few weeks 
of budget proceedings. 

In the past three weeks, the A.S. 
Finance Committee has deliberated 
for over 24 hours on Leventhal's 
Executive Budget proposal, and 
throughout these deliberations, the 
commillee amended his budget to 
become more representative of stu-
dent interests, not special interests. 

The committee amended the bud-
get to support the Academic Success 
Program (A.S.P.). This program was 
on the A.S. elecLion ballot and 
received 69 percent (1,852 students) 
approval., but lacked in voter tumou\. 
In addition, over 2,300 students 
signed a petition in support of plac-
ing ASP on the ballot. 

The commillee realized that 
with a sound proposal and the over-
whelming student assessment and 
support, Leventhal and the A.S. 
Council should supportA.S.P. Even 
when this issue was brought to A.S. 
Council for final approval, over 60 
percent of council moved to pass 

A.S.P. 
With the hours of deliberations, 

Leventhal should have respected 
the democratic votes taken by the 
student body (69 percent), the A.S. 
Finance Commitlee (63 percent) 
and the A.S. Council (62 percent). 
But because A.S.P. is not in his per-
sonal agenda, Leventhal vetoed it. 

Leventhal claimed that there was 
insufficient infonnation, no account-
ability, no track record and too much 
money to allocate for one service. 
He stealthily forgets to mention his 
own special interests in his executive 
budge\. Leventhal proposed creating 
a marketing director with a student 
staff and supplies - budgeting a 
total of over $6O,OOO! Basically, the 
director would oversee and coordi-
nate the publicity of the A.S. Council 
by making A.S. more known around 
campus and the community. 

Lillie infonnation was distributed 
and no accountability was estab-
lished - other than it being 
Leventhal's project. This is also a 
risky new step for the A.S. Council 
to take since there is no track record 
or practice of this program, yet none 
of this is quesLioned by Leventhal. 

A.S.P., on the other hand, com-
piled a sound budget proposal 
including the mission statement, 
budget narrative, policies and pro-
cedures and a draft charter to 
ensure accountability to the A.S. 
Furthermore, the marketing direc-
tor was not democratically assessed 
from the student body like the 
A.S.P. Thus, Leventhal's marketing 
director exposes the hypocrisy 
behind his veto. 

Leventhal's attack on A.S.P. is

Homosexuality Is a 
Â·Ufestyle Choice' 
Editor: 

I would like to go on record and 
voice my opposition to the pro-

posed LGBT Resource Center. In 
this letter, I use the word "homo-
sexuality" as also including bise)(u-
ality and transgenderism. 

My first objection is that the 
proposed center is not necessarily 
because homosexuality is a choice. 
It is always possible for one to alter 
their Ii festyle. Neither the fact that 
one may not wi h to do so nor how 
difficult the alteration would de 
voids this possibility. Having an 
LGBT Resource Center for gays 
would make just as much sense as 
having a "Star Trek" Resource 
Center for TrekJdes. 

The Women's Center and Cross-
Cultural Center are primarily for 
people who are female andlor 
closely related to another culture, 
neither of which is duc to the 
respective person's choices. But 
being gay is a choice; it's not an 
unalterable fact. 

No resource center should exist 
in order to help people promote the 
lifestyles that they have freely cho-
sen. A student club, such as the cur-
rent LGBTA, would be a much 
more appropriate organization. 

My second objection is based 
on the finding I disagree with 
homosexuality for both personal 
and religious reasons. Would it 
then be right to require me to pay 
for an institution that forwards it? 
I should not be forced to pro-
mote, through tuition and related 
fees, lifestyles that I consider 
immoral. 

My third objecLion is a reaction 
to part of the article on the LGBT 
Resource Center in the May 14 
Guardian. The fact that all other 

UC campuses have such centers is 
not an argument in favor of UCSD 
beginning its own. Need I point out 
the fallacy of doing something 
because "everybody's doing it?" 
Having an LGBT Resource Center 
is a bad idea.

McCurry Statement 
not a Gender Issue 
Editor: 

I was disturbed after reading the 
article "When the First Lady 
Speaks, We Should Listen" by 
Jessyca Wallace in the Mon .. May 
II issue of the Guardian regarding 
the incident when Hillary Clinton 
publicly stated that the future of 
Israel would include a separate 
"functioning modem [Palestinian] 
state". 

In her commentary, Wallace 
twisted the incident into a women's 
issue. Regardless of Hillary 
Clinton's gender, her statement 
contradicted U.S. policy. Male or 
female, White House spokesman 
Mike McCurry would have 
expressed the policy maker's rejFc-
tion of the contradictory remark to 
reporters. 

I am not saying that Hillary 
Clinton should not have expressed 
her opinion, as I think every opin-
ion should be heard. r am only say-
ing that the response to her opinion 
had nothing to do with the fact that 
she was female and that by twist-
ing the incident into one that is, as 
Wallace stated, "denigrating to all 
women" disturbingly avoids the

main issue. 

What is important in this inci -
dent is the future of Israel and 
the peace process. When 
Wallace, at the end of her arti cle, 
addressed this central issue she 
commented that "if the Jews and 
the Israeli s deserve a homeland, 
so do the Palestinians," and "it is 
disheartening" that Jews "cannot 
ex tend to the Palestinians the 
courtesy of giving them their 
own land." 

Was she forgetting the UN 
Partition Plan of 1947 which sug-
gested that the land be split in two 
before Israel ever existed as a 
state? The act was accepted by 
Jews but rejccted by Palestinians. 
When offered a separate state, the 
Palestinians did not want it. 

I, too, desire peace and wish to 
discover the perfect solution, but is 
a separate state the perfect solu-
tion'? Will both sides accept it? 
Will it end the animosity or will 
the fighting and hatred continue 
across the state border? 

Hillary Clinton's solution is not 
necessarily the most ideal solu-
tion, despite the fact that she may 
be, as Wallace states, "ideally the 
most important and innuential 
woman in this country and, more-
or-less the world." Whether or not 
one agrees with Hillary Clinton, 
like every person, she should be 
heard, but we do not necessari ly 
have to "li sten" merely because 
she is the first lady.

C8l11pu.wlde Appeal 
Editor: 

There are some problems with 
Guardiall Feature ' Arena that I 
would like to address. 

There arc five spaces in the 
Arena section. One might assume 
that this is because there are five 
colleges and that Arena is sup-
posed to give views from each of 
them, but that assumption is obvi-
ously wrong since I don' t think 
I've ever seen all fi ve colleges rep-
resented in one Arena. 

I can't even remember the last 
time I saw a Muir student represent- . 
ed. In fact, the Arena in the Mon., 
May II , issue of the Guardian had 
representatives from only two col-
leges, Revelle and Warren. 

Can't you choose between the 
opinions from studenl~? The lack of 
coherent thought in most responses 
is comical.Take Siobhan Kelley, 
who must have thought she was 
asked a different question than 
"How effective arc self-defense 
lessons?" when she answered that 
"it i important, especially for 
women, to be able to defend them-
selves. If someone is attacking you, 
you should be able to kick their ass." 

I'm glad you think all people 
who are attacked should be able to 
kick their auacker's ass, but I don't 
see how this answers the question 
asked in any way. Did this get 
slipped in by accident? 

My personal favorite from that 
Arena is Mr. Jonathan Pena's 
response, a perfect example of a 
typical UCSD student. "For me, 
boxing and karate work. If I need 
to defend myself, I'm going to 
knock some fool out real easily." 

The UCSD GuardiaR ' 

What the?!? Nice try on answer-
ing the question, Jon. You stayed on 
track for one sentence. 1 guess you 
could say self-defense "work ." But 
what was that last part about knock-
ing orne foo l out "real easily"'? 

The imprcssion that I gct from 
this re ponsc is that UCSD is pop-
ulated by grimacing macho thug 
eager to knock out any "fool" who 
messcs with them, and who 
answer questions by bragging 
about how tough they are. I don't 
know about you, but this is not the 
impression I have of UCSD stu-
dents and T hope it isn't the 
impression other people get of 
UCSD either. (Kudos to the other 
three "Arena" people for respond-
ing that self-defense classes aren ' t 
very effective at protecting you in 
a fight. I've never been to a martial 
arts class that claims it is anything 
but a last resort.) 

The questions in Arena are also 
always so biased and meaningless. 
That same Monday 's Arena ques-
tion was really more of a statement 
about what the interviewer wanted 
people to say then a question. 
Instead of asking, "How effective 
are self-defense lessons?" why not 
try something that will make peo-
ple have to think before answering? 

At least re-phrase the question 
so that the effecti vcness of self-
defense isn ' t emphasized. Why not 
ask a question that lets people talk 
about the physical and mental ben-
efi ts that martial arts can give? 

It docsn't even delve into the 
issues of how long it takes to 
become even slightly proficient at 
self-defense, or the chance that a 
person atlacking you is armed or 
twice as big as you. For the ques-
tion to be even mildly meaningful 

,it would have to be something 
like, "How effective would a per-
son your size be with 3 years of 
self-defense training at defending 
yourself again t an unarmed oppo-
nent of your weight who attacks 
you with warning?" 

This question actually sets ome 
bounds on what is being asked, but 
it is also almost totally pointless. 
How often do unarmed people 
attack other people? How often are 
the attackers and attacked of the 
same size or number? Even if it is 
moot, this question is still better 
then the original, and that shows 
how dumb the first question is. 

If meaningless answers are 
your purpose, fine, but I would 
assume you would want to try and 
give other people insight into stu-
dent opinions on real issues. Why 
not ask a question where you 
might actually get differing opin-
ions? There are lots of hot, on-
campus issues. 

Take the new division II deci-
sion (should there be scholar-
ships?) or maybe Pete Wilson's 
temporary support of student fees. 
On a global scale, a 101 of people 
fee l that Palestinians are being 
treated badly by Israel. I'm sure 
you would get lots of very heated 
responses to a question like that 
(especially if you asked, "How 
badly are the Palestinians being 
treated by Israel" - do you see 
what I mean about biased ques-
tions?) India tested a nuke, that 
always gets strong opinions from 
people. Or maybe you should just 
ask, "How effective do you feel 
Arena is at conveying tudent 
opinion?" or "How much do you 
like Arena and why?"

'WEAR JEANS IF YOU'RE GAY DAY' DEFEATS ITS PURPOSE 
By Mark Smith 
Staff Writer 

It came to my atLention rather 
abrupt,ly la t Thursday that I was 
gay. Apparently, the Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual Transsexual Association 
(LGBTA) - which seems to be 
adding leiters to its acronym at an 
alarmingly fast rate - had deemed 
last Thursday "Wear Jeans ifYou'rc 
Gay" day. 

Well , it just so happens that on 
Thursday I woke up early for work, 
showered, threw on some jeans and 
ripped out the door, unaware that I 
was taking a huge leap out of my 
personal closet. 

Now this was a cheap trick. 
What a terribly planned and ill-
thought out scheme last Thursday's 
"awareness" day was. This "holi-
day" was not only illogical, but it 
was also counterproducti ve in that 
it showcd the student body that the 
LGBTA has destroyed exactly what 
homosexuals have been trying to 
advocate for decades - considera-
Lion for other's valucs and beliefs.

as an aside, are not synonymous. I 
am, however against hypocritical 
"holidays," and, in particular, I am 
against last Thursday 's "Wear 
Jeans if You're Gay" day. 

How exactly was this hypocriti -
cal? The idca behind this day was 
that people wearing jeans were 
making a statement that they wcre 
ei ther themselves homose)(uals or 
supporti ve of homosexuality. 
Through this public di splay of sup-
pon, thc students of UCSD could 
see how many people were in sup-

be made more aware of the exis-
tence of homosexuals on campus. 

The result of thi s holiday, how-
ever, was not onc of gay awarencss, 
nor a mass-closet exodus. What it 
did accomplish, though, was the 
forcing of people who did not nec-
essarily suppon homosexuality and 
were not gay to proclaim thei r sup-
port. 

In an arena as touchy and filled 
with emotion as homosexuality, the 
LGBTA must eonsiderthat the peo-

did not consider other pcoplc' val-

ple into mock support for it cause 
- a cause of consideration and 
acceptance of alternate values and 
bcliefs. Therein lies the glaring 
hypocrisy. 

There are two distinct disjoint 
possibilities. Ei ther Lhe founders of 
this blessed holiday did not consid-
er the fact that people were going to 
wear jeans regardless of their sup-
port of homosexu(\lity, or they did. 

Let's consider the first possibili-
ty. What the creators of thi s holiday 
did not consider is that people 
were going to wear jeans without 
knowing what they were saying. 
Jeans are extremely common and 
are often worn without a second 
thought. r f Lhis case is true, the cre-
ators of the "Wear Jeans if You're 
Gay" day are simply stupid.

they knew people were going to 
unknowingly wear jean . 

The second possibility tates that 
Lhc founders of this holiday did con-
sider that people would wear jean 
without knowing about the mcaning 
of such an action. In this ca~, the 
LGBTA knowingly foreed people to 
declare their homosexuality or sup-
port thereof, regardless of their val-
ues and beliefs. If this case is true, 
the creators of the "Wear Jeans if 
You're Gay" day are hypocrites. 

For the sake of the homosexual 
movement T hope that the first case 
is the one thaL is true. Regardless, 
in response to this unsolicited trick, 
I am deeming today the "breathe if 
you didn't mean to wear jeans last

PROCESS: 
Applications are 
closely evaluated 
ContInued from pace 1 
Brown said 

The central processor was 
unable to determine if 7,000 bor-
derline applicants were eligible to 
allend UCSD. UCSD determined 
that 2,000 of these 7,000 applica-
tions were actually ineligible in 
what is known as an "additional 
review," CUlling the number of 
applications to 26,000. 

These 26,000 applications are 
ranked based on the applicant's 
"academic index score," based on 
his or her GPA, SAT. scores and 
AP classes, among other factors. 
Campus administrators have set a 
target of 3,000 students in the 
freshman class, but because just 24 
percent of admitted students tradi-
tionally decide to attend UCSD, the 
actual number of admits must Ix: 
considerably larger. 

"To get 3,000 freshman we 
know we have to admit 13,000," 
Backer said. 

As mandated by the University 
Admissions Policy, set by the 
Academic Senate, the top 60 per-
cent- approximately 7,SOO - of 
these 13,000 students are admitted 
solely on the basis of their acade-
mic index scores. The remaining 
40 percent- approximately 5,200 
students - are drawn from the 
rest of the applicant pool using a 
variety of supplemental criteria. 

In an allempt to decide which 
of the remaining applicants will be 
admitted, their a,pplications are 
then reviewed with the proverbial 
fine-toothed comb. 

"It has been suggested that 
unlike Berkeley or UCLA, we 
don't read applications; [that] we 
do a formulaic approach, which is 
all based on numbers," Backer 
said. ".Well, that's completely erro-

neous. Last year we read 16,000 
applications. So, it couldn't be fur-
ther from the truth." 

Thirteen people in the admis-
sions office read nearly 18,000 
applications this year, Backer said. 

According to the admis ions 
policy, "Evaluators perform a 
qualitative g::-reading that consid-
ers factors such as leadership, spe-
cial talents/ kills, community/vol-

Backer, Brown and Kane also

been occurring with the admissions 
process, such as the removal of rclce

Backer echoed Brown's senti-

ments. 
"We're looking for students that

Backer said. "If you were strong in 
high school, then your chances of 
succeeding here arc very good. 
Because we get so many strong stu-
dents academically. to make the 
decision of who we're going to Lake, 
we look for well-rounded students 
who have done things outside of aca-
demics, outside the classroom and in 
the community." 

Once the 13,000 admits are 
chosen, the thick and thin 
envelopes that are the highlight 
and bane of many high-schoolers' 
existences are mailed out. 

"Letters go out the first week in 
March," Brown said. "We create a

admissions process, campus offi-
cials began additional outreach 
and additional recruiting. 

"There is no surrogate for 
race," Backer said. "Even if they 
substituted or expanded socioeco-
nomic factors, geographic factors, 
school factors, there's no substi-
tute for race." 

,Moreover, Backer said that he 
believed the numbers of minority 
students accepted and enrolling at 
UCSD would rise again. 

"Affirmative action worked to 
benefit populations who for years 
did not benefit from equal oppor-
tunity and preparation," he said. 
"So, while the numbers on our 
campus dropped, we're very confi-
dent that the numbers will come 
back. We're woding with schools 
to get students better prepared.".

Since 1991 thousands ofTestMasters students have increased their LSAT scores 
by applying the powerful methods and techniques that Robin has developed. 

Although race and gender are 
no longer factors in determining 
who is admitted to UCSD, there 
are sti II boxes for applicants to 
identify their race andlor gender 
on the UC application. Responses 
are optional, however, and Backer 
said the data is used for non-
admissions purpose . 

The federal government 
requires campus officials to report 
the ethnic breakdown of students 
receiving financial aid, such as 
federally backed loans, and gender 
is still important for campus hous-
ing purposes. 

Brown also talked about 
recruiting in California in Qrder to 
extend UCSD's presence through-
out the state. 

"We have, in fact, two profes-
sional staff member ," Brown 
said. "One in [Los Angeles]; and 
one in [San Francisco] . They cover 
a wide variety of the schools in 
those particular areas. 

"We have our own regional 
area, San Diego and Imperial 
County, but in general we have out-
reach officers - especially during 
the peak time - covering many of 
the high schools in the area," 
Brown continued. "We're targeting 
high school seniors primarily from 
September through about the first 
week in November. We also target 
community colleges to recruit the 
transfer students." 

According to Brown, admis-
sions staff meet with high school 
counselors so they will better 
understand the UC admissions 
process and pass the knowledge on 
to their students. In general, the 
outreach programs help to give 
high school students a beller look 
at the admissions process and 
UCSD as a whole. 

"When we send our people out 
to high schools, we have to tell 
them about the environment, and 
we have to tell them what our stu-
dents think of it," Backer said.

DATA: Numbers

Filipinos increase 
Continued from pace 1 
cent); 1.7 percent African 
American (down 23.S percent); 
2. I percent Latino (up 13.4 per-
cent); 5.3 percent Filipino (up 6.7 
percent) ; 6 .2 percent Mexican 
American (down 28.4 percent); 
28.9 percent Asian American 
(down 1.7 percent); and 36.9 per-
cent Caucasian (down 9.8 per-
cent). A total of IS.3 percent of 
the accepting students, up by 
72.7 percent from last year, did 
not identify their race or ethnici-
ty. 

According to Nick Aguilar, 
di rector of student policies and 
judicial affairs, the focus of stu-
dent affirmative action in the 
future is going to be directed 
more toward "assessing the 
effectiveness of the campus 
efforts to respond to the needs of 
underrepresented students, to 
ensure that we have a diverse stu-
dent body coming into this cam-
pus and that the student body 
itself continues to be as diverse 
as it shou ld be." 

Watson commented on the 
decline and the message it sends to 
potential underrepresented-minori-
ty students. 

''This should be totally unac-
ceptable and changed quickly," 
Watson said. "I hope it does not 
encourage anyone not to come to 
UCSD." 

Watson said that the lack of 
racial diversity in next year's 
freshman class should be a call to 
arms to reverse the current state of 
affairs - to make certain that all 
underrepresented students receive 
solid educations in their secondary 
schools and have the opportunity 
to attend the University of 
California.

RESEARCH: 
Students in all 
disciplines participate 
Continued from ..... 3 
Student Association (ASA) at 
UCSD, Mirzaian explores the sen-
timents of how the e students iden-
tify themselves within their socio-
historic context. 

"Through my observations and 
interviews, r concluded that 
Armenians in ASA do not consider 
themselves white in any meaning-
ful way," Mirzaian said. "Their 
sdf-identifiealion is best and per-
haps only satisfied with Armenian 
or Armenian American, depending 
on who' doing the aski ng." 

Mirzaian's study includes a 
questionnaire-interview with seven 
ASA members. When confronted 
with the issue of which race these 
students wou ld best identify them-
selves with, one student answered, 
"given the option, they would 
choose to mark 'other' (over white) 
and write in Armenian. 

''The consistency with which 
respondents favored other more 
than white is a clear indication that 
the category white does not corre-
late to the self-identification of 
Armenians here at UCSD's ASA," 
the report states. 

Mirzaian's study also takes into 
consideration the sociohistorical 
role that has had a significant 
impact upon the Armenian race. 

The Armenian genocide by the 
Ottoman empire in 1915, which 
resulted in the death of 500,000 
people, is one of the indicators of 
Armenian identity. Mirzaian notes 
that remnants of the allempted 
annNiilation are still apparent today 
as the Turkish government has con-
tinued to deny that these acts con-
stituted genocide. 

"Every tudent who presented 
loday was judged by a faculty 
member who they work with as 
doing outstanding research," said 
Darlene Salmon, the conference 
coordinator. 

Nominations were sent out to 
every faculty member to recom-
mend an undergraduate student 
who was involved in outstanding 
research. 

The conference was organized 
into roundtable discussions based 
on unifying research themes, each 
attended by one or more modera-
tors and about 15 students attend-
ing and presenting. 

Each student was awarded a cer-
ti ficate as a research scholar at the 
end of the conference.

"At first I wasn't 
.ure what It wa. 
going to be like, but 
It'. really good to 
have a member of 
your family on tour 
with you - to be 
able to turn to 
them." 

- Michael Gallagher 
Male lead in "Riverdance" 

was going to be like, but its really 
good to have a member of your 
family on tour with you - to be 
able to tum to them." 

Contrary to what some might 
think, following in Flatley'S foot-
steps has not been difficult. 
Although the shows arc compared, 
the issue is a moot point. 

For Gallagher, one of the 
strangest things to get used to is 
performing before an audience 

rather than in front of judges. 
"Before that, as Irish dancers we 

were used to just competing," he 
said. "We were judged on the merit 
of our performance - whether it be 
our foot placing, our carriage or how 
straight our arms were by our side. 
So it's quite different performing at a 
show where you're perfonning for 
2,000 people every night. 

"It's not as strict a such and yet 
it takes the performance to a new 
level," Gallagher added. 

So far, his ride with "River-
dance" has been smooth sai ling. 

"Maybe once in a blue moon 
someone misses a step and there's a 
space at the end of the stage where 
they should have been," he said. 
''That happens very rarely, though." 

Before his arrival to the United 
States, Gallagher toured the UK 
where he aid that audiences were 
much more reserved. But he appre-
ciates the different responses from 
North American crowds. 

"The audiences both hl:re and in 

HIATUS 13 

Canada have been great," he said. 
" It helps your performance when 
you have a good audience behind 
you. You really feed off the energy 
of the audience." 

What does it feel like to be cen-
ter stage in the mid t of such 
incredible energy? 

" It 's a great feeling," he sa id, 
"especiall y the tinale when you 
have everyone standing and 
applauding. Other than that you 
rea lly don ' t think about it that 
much. But at the end of the night, 
you're on a buzz." 

With his aggressive and talented 
dancing, Gallagher is storming the 
dance world. Although he may be a 
product of Flatley 's legacy, there's 
no doubt Gallagher is dancing ajig 
all hi s own. 

There are cUITCntly two "River-
dance" companies touring the 
world. A third will begin perfor-
mances this coming January.

'Deep I..,ad' FaL to Leave More Than a Dent 
New action thriller contains nothing but stereotypical characters, a thin plot and no bad guys 

Deep Impact 
* .~ Morgan Freeman , Tea Leoni, 
Robert Duvall , Elijah Wood, Vanessa 
Redgrave and Leelee Sobieski. 

By Asaph Amlr 
Staff Writer 

"Deep Impact," directed by 
Mimi Leder, is a mediocre movie 
about an apocalyptic comet head-
ing toward Earth . 

The film boasts a crew of 
stereotypical disaster-film heroes 
and bystanders but no worthy pro-
tagonist or plot line. 

Morgan Freeman stars as the 
somber, eloquent pres ident while 
Robert Duvall, with hi s patented 
ironic laugh, is the intrepid astro-
naut who nukes the come I. 

For the sake of plot conve-
nience, however, the nukes just end 
up spl iuing the eomet into two 
smaller comets, which still head 
directly toward Earth . 

By hav in g two comets, the 
film demonstrates sal vation and 
destruction at the S"'dme time. 
While one comet is still bi g 
enough to annihilate the earth , 
the other is smaller and wi II 
merely kill millions of people. 

The form er mi ght still be 
destroyed, while the latter is 
promised to hit the Earth . 

How very convenient that the 
special-effects people can then 

crea te a terrific vision of a holo-
caust. 

The plot includes an interest-
ing but horrifi c scheme for the 
selective salvati on of Earth 's 
den izens. An underground mine, a 
modern Noah's Ark, is built to 
shelter a chosen few fro m the 
comets' destruction. 

The thcmes of surviva l would 
normall y allow for intcres ti ng 
deve lopments of both treachery 
and heroism, yet the di splays of 
surviva l and sacrifi ce lack credi-
bility and fa il to inspire. 

The film is especia lly weak at 
the beginning. The audience must 
contend with a reeling introduc-
tion to a motley assortment of 
characters and a contrived car 
crash staged specificall y as a plot 
device. 

Also appeari ng in "Deep 
Impact" is Elijah Wood as a young 
Romco. Unfortunately, Wood's 
perfo rma nce features excessive 
naivete and min imal credibility. 

Adding at least a touch of digni-
ty is Vanessa RedgraYe, a wife 
scorned in her middle age by her 
ex-husband, played by Maximillian 
Schell . 

Tea Leoni stars as the couple's 
daughter who is bitter toward her 
father. Leoni melodramatically car-
ries the film 's narrative as a celebri -
ty anchorwoman.

'General Chaos' is Brash, Aggressive and iI Your Face 

'Toon collection at Landmark Theater in Hillcrest demonstrate$ the result of animators on the cutting edge of art 
By Ilona Faas 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

It 's crude, It 's crass. It's "Gener-
al Chaos: Uncensored Animation," 
an hour-and-a- half of "adult" ani -
mation aimed to please the most 
base and childish instincts within 
us. 

Sketches include "American 
Flatulators," with fart-wa rs Ameri -
can-Gladiator style; "Junky," a 
puppet animation sketch about a 
parrot who gets tricked into being 
sodomized by a rea l pe rson (note: 
endi ng credit for this sketch had a 
butt double to thank); and "Attack 
of Ihe Hungry, Hungry Nipples," a 
vari ety of c1aymati on sketches that 
border on pornography. 

The point is folks, th is is the 
kind of film you should either go 
so lo to or with a group of fri ends 
with whom you feel very comfort-
able. 

Do I JOt venture out try ing to 
impress a date with this onc. 

Despite the rather revolLi ng 
nature of the majority of the topics 
shown, the animation is clever. 
There is no denying that creators 
like Bill Plympton, Mike Booth , 
Lee Wilton and the Bolex Brothers 
are extremely talented, cutting-
edge artists. 

This is a one-of-a-kind compi la-
ti on features animated vignettes of 
the computer-generated, cell, pup-
pet, stop-motion and clay-mated 
variety. 

This is the one how you don' t 
want to miss. Spike and Mike 
would be proud of this sick and 
twisted co llection. "General 
Chaos" is among us. 

This animatcd collection will be 
hown tomorrow through the June 

25 at the Ken Theater in Kensing-
LO n. 

For more in formation, call 283-
3227. 

If your appetite for smudge isn't 
satiated yet, here arc a few syn-
opses of some of the film short : 

"Beat the Meatles" 
T hi is a coll aborated effort 

be tween animators Keith Alcorn, 
Paul Claerhout and Gerald Stock-
ton to produce a satirica l record 
commercial featuring the top hits 
of the greate t pop group of all 
ti me. 

" Body Directions" 
Direc lor and animator Karl 

Siaven came up with this beauty. 
When an attractive young lady falls 
a leep m:xt to an animator, she 
becomes "infested" with little ani-
mated characters. 

"Donor Party" 
Created by Laurence Arcadi as, 

thi s grue ome canoon leads audi-
ences along the dark and dusty cor-
ners of a Victorian mansion . 
Cramped spaees and panic saturate 
the cene. Not for claustro phobics. 

" Espresso Depresso" 
Animator David Donar plays on 

today 's coffee culture with this 
spoof about a coffeehouse which 
invites all wa lks of life into its 
wall s. The patrons of Espresso 
Depresso include paranoid Goethe 
beatn iks, pretentious yuppie 
boomers, earthy tree-loving Marx-
ist hippies and a psychotic bi -polar 
freak. 

"Malice in Wonderland 
This is a sexuall y hysterical 

interpretati on of the classic Lewis 
Carrol story, to say the least. Vince 
Collins has laken this children's 
class ic and tu rned it into an 
absolute nightmare. 

"The Saint Inspector"

Mike Booth and Lee Wilton comes 
this fil m short about bureaucracy 
gone awry,

-â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 
It isn't often that new and innov-

ative sounds permeate the music 
industry. In those rather rare occur-
rences that music strikes a new 
chord, one may find a group like Air. 

Their album, Moon Safari, is a 
unique blend of instrumental tracks 
and vocal numbers that renect the 
progressive new music currently 
flowing westward from France. 

Songs such as "All I Need" and 
"You Make It Easy" renect the 
power of this mood-inducing 
music. With its happy, melodic 
baselines coupled with spacey, 
electronic swirl s, Moon Safari 
quickly engulfs you in an uplifting, 
sonic experience. 

The trick to this mood-provoking 
music lies in the frolic-on-a Sunday-
afternoon bass-lines along with the 
psychedelic elements that accompa-
ny most tracks on the album. 

People who enjoy listening to 
imports or simply wish to impress 
others with their worldly musical 
tastes will agree lhal Moon Safari 
is triumphant in capturing a'sophis-
ticated angle lo music li stening.

Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ 

--
-

â¢ â¢â¢ 
On Limp Bizkit's debut effort, 

Three Dollar 8j/[, Yall$, the band 
successfully fuses metal and rap to 
create powerful, thrashy tunes with 
a beat. 

The problem is that this Pan-
tera-meet-the-Beastie Boys sty le 
of rock was already claimed 
years ago by bands like Korn and 
The Deftones. The result is a 
solid but unoriginal album -
frontman Fred Durst' s vocals 
resemble a combination of 
Korn's Jonathan Davi s, The 
Deftones ' Chino Moreno, plus a 
little of Beavis' "Great Cornho-
lio." 

Limp Bizkit's near-emulation of 
these bands is no surprise, consid-
ering that Limp Bizkit toured with 
The Deftones before recording 
Three Dollar Bill, Yall$. Producer 
Ross Robinson also worked with 
Korn on both of their CDs. Korn 
helped ign Limp Bizkit with Inter-
scope Records. 

On the track "Indigo Flow," 
Limp Bizkit go so far as to thank 
Korn and The DeflOnes for their 
help. Often, the only apparent dif-

Thursday. May 21,1998 

ferenee between Limp Bizkit and 
these two bands is the addition of 
record-scratching, which only suc-
ceeds in further homogenizing their 
sound. 

Although any fan of contempo-
rary metal ha undoubtedly been 
here and done this, Three Dollar 
Bill, Yall$ stands on its own, featur-
ing several great tunes. This album 
is strongest when the band incorpo-
rates other musical genres like jazz, 
funk and hip-hop, creating a hybrid 
sty le on tracks such as "Stuck" and 
"Stalemate." The latter even fea-
tures a Middle-Eastern feel at 
times. 

The aggressive music matches 
the confrontational lyrics from 
Durst, who u'nloads on every-
thing from ex-girlfriends to 
sycophantic, poser fans of the 
band. 

Last, but not least, Limp Bizk-
it's cover of George Michael's 
"Faith" offers comic relief to an

BEATING: 
Everyone loves those 
wacky Sun God stories 
Continued from ..... 24 
then one hole in the next and then two again 
to the finish . This last part of the course was 
where the battle ensued. 

I crawled through the tunnel and scaled the 
wall wilh ease and made it through the first 
hole before my nemesis; he met me at the sec-
ond hole. There was only one way out and 
there were two of us. 

I daned for the hole and got my head 
through first, but it was not enough, My com-
petitor grabbed my leg and pulled hi s gut over 
my body, through the hole. Yet I would not be 
denied. Through the last hole, I gave him a 
taste of his own medicine. I gave his leg a 
yank and crushed his body as I used his head 
to pull myself over him to victory. 

I rolled off the mat and to the grass below, 
my chest heaving. These rides were tougher 
than I had anticipated, especially in my ine-
briated state. I had won, however, and my 
spirit was soaring. Unfortunately, the feeling 
of exhilaration was shon-lived. 

My next event was the one that will stick 
in my memory for years to come - the box-
ing ring. Already exhausted from my other 
athletic endeavors, I stumbled to the boxing 
ring, hoping to face myoid nemesis from the 
bongee and obstacle course. Yet due to some 
mix up, he was off flining with the women's 
soccer learn when I entered the ri ng. 

My opponent turned out to be tall, lanky 
economics nerd, paler than a ghost. He was 
obviously intoxicated, but he still had a gleam 
in hi s eye. You could tell he had been beaten 
down by a life filled with verba l abuse and 
math problems, paired with many years of 
sexual frustration . He obviously had some 
aggression to let out in the ring. 

Although we were in the same weight 
class, I worried about thi s pallid Irishman' 
reach. As he put the gloves on and pulled the 
padded headgear over hi s greasy cranium, 1 
planned my strategy. I wanted to get inside 
and nullify his reach advantage. I hoped that a 
nurry of body blows would daze him just 
enough so I could get some head shots in. 

Yet, even the best-laid plans are sometimes 
foiled by a crazed, drunken and frustrated 
loser. The whistle sounded and he came at me, 
unleashing wild wings. My feel felt like jelly 
on the innatable mat and I had a hard time 
keeping my balance as the tall beast came 
closer. He battered me senseless as I held my 
gloves up to protect my face. A body blow 
sent me on my boll to the mat in my comer. 

He backed up and although I went down, I 
could see he was winded. I had to make my 
move. I charged him this time, gloves flying . 
I got some good body shots in, but he refused 
to fall. He sidestepped my advances and let 
his huge, gloved hand crash down on my 
head. My head gear flew off as I crumpled. 

I stood up and my vision was blurred. If it 
was from the alcohol or the beating, I could 
not tell. I did know that r then saw 15 images 
of my gaunt opponent dancing around my 
head (all of which were in severe need of a 
tan). I reached down to put my headgear on 
and found my gloved hands were mostly use-
less. Finally succeeding in getting it on, r 
turned to face my fate. 

Only then did I realize I had put it on back-
wards. My blurred vision was now also 
obscured. I never saw the right hook coming, 
but I was told about it afterwards and I did 
feel its effects. As far as I'm concerned, this 
crushing blow could have knocked out Rocky 
Balboa. 

My head whipped backwards violently as J 
felt my feet leave the mat. My body soared 
backwards out of the ropes and everything 
went black. I landed on my back with a 
resounding thump on the grass b~ow. I 
looked up to see the greasy nerd appealing to 
the crowd with arms raised. 

As I rolled onto my stomach and spit out 
SOl')1e of my teeth, I realized my dreams of 
heavyweight stardom were over almost before 
lhey had begun. My jaw ached as I pulled off 
my gloves and headgear and tried to regain 
my confidence. Being bested by an uncoordi -
nated ec~n major can do damage to a young 
fighter's psyche. AU I could do was pick up 
my pride and have a talk with some fly UCSD 
ladies who had winked at me when I was get-
ting my ass beat down. I had been beaten this 
time, but hey, I could still get girls. 

Pride salvaged.

22 SPORTS 

CYCLING 
A year ago, when Jenny Eyer-

man made the transition from the 
UCSD crew team to the cycling 
team, riding between 200 and 300 
miles per week in lraining must 
have appeared to her a daunting 
task. 

The grueling work-load paid 
off, though, afier the third-year stu-
dent earned a trip to the Olympic 
Training Center in Indianapolis last 
weekend to take pan in a one-week 
development camp for future 
Olympians. 

Eyerman was given this honor 
after UCSD competed in the 1998 
National Collegiate Road Champi-
onships last weekend in Greenville, 
S.c. Eyerman garnered a presti-
gious second place in the Individ-
ual Omnium (overall individual 
award) and received the free trip to 
Indianapolis along with the top five 
women from 18 to 22 years of age. 

The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD Sports Clubs 

There were no divisions, thus 
amateurs raced against profession-
als in the battle for the touted Stars 
& Stripes Jersey, the National 
Championship award. 

In her first national competition, 
Eyerman fini shed third in a field of 
99 in the six-lap, 51 -mile road race 
behind Cynthia Ferguson of Stan-
ford and Mina Pizzini of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. The two 
broke away from the pack during 
the hill climb approximately three 
miles from the finish and never 
looked back. 

Thursday. May 21. 1998 

The competition included three 
events. For the men, these were a 
78-mile road race, a 12-mile team 
time trial and a 45-mile criterium, 
which is approximately a one-mile 
loop that competitors circle. For the 
women, the events consisted of a 
51 -mile road race, a 12-mile team 
time trial and a 30-mile criterium. 

Eyerman, sticking with the pack 
until the very end, managed to lead 
the sprint for third place, finishing 
only 25 seconds behind her two 
adversaries. 

Courtesy of sports clubs 
the ...... : The UCSD cycling club traveled to Greenville, S.C. last weekend and held its own against 
the rest of the nation. It was led by Jenny Eyerman, who was the placed second in the nation overall. 

The combined results from the 
two individual events were tallied 
for the Omnium results. 

A field of 30 teams from 175 
nationwide programs qualified for 
the Championships, including 161 
male competitors and 99 female 
competitors. 

"I was on somebody's wheel 
most of the time, drafting," Eyer-
man said. "I broke away early for 
the sprint, which can be bad 
because somebody can draft off of 
you and go right around you at the 
finish. But I was able to hold the 
pack." 

Powerhouse University of Col-
orado, the eventual overall team 
winner, actually showed up with 

walkie-talkies to give itself an 
advantage during the race. Walkie-
talkies can be used in this team 
sport to coordinate strategic moves, 
but they were unsuccessful in hin-
dering Eyerman, who managed to 
beat everyone of Colorado's 
cyclists in the heated finish. 

"It felt good to beat somebody 
with walkie-talkies," Eyerman said. 

!n the 30-mile criterium, she 
surged in the final stretch for a

fifth-place finish, despite delirium

She and teammate Joy Cadelina 
earned 14th place in the team time-
tria! with their two-woman team. 
Cadelina cruised to a 39th-place 
finish in the road race. 

Eyerman's accolades overshad-
owed a ninth-place overall finish 
by the UCSD cycling team, 
anchored by a strong men's team. 
Senior team-president Ben Bonnes 

held strong, finishing 6! st of 161 
male cyclists, followed by team-
mates Tom Toth (91 st), Chria 
Hazlitt (1 10th), and Jon Mogilski 
(115th). In the criterium event, 
Bonnes fared even better, finishing 
35th. In the team-time trial, 
UCSD's team of Bonnes, Toth, 
Hazlitt and Dan Lindell fought 
their way into 15th place in the 12-
mile event.

HISTORY: 
UCSD crew finishes 
record-breaking year 
Continued from page 24 

Head Coach Mike Filippone 
was c1ated. 

"We accomplished every goal 
we set out to do at the beginning of 
the year," Filippone said of the var-
sity eight, which defeated every 
non-Divi ion I team it faced (with 
the exception of a photo-finish sec-
ond to Virginia in the Crew Clas-
sic). "It's a great feeling. UCSO's 
never gone this fast. We completed 
the year the very best we could. 
The guys feel great about it, I feel 
great about it; hopefully the school 
wiIJ notice." 

JV WralHlP 
The men's JV eight also fin-

ished the season in fin e form . 
Though it did not qualify for the 
Grand Final, the team made it to 
the Petite Final for the second tier 
of qualifiers. In the Petite, the men 
placed third, ahead of Washington 
State and SDSU, good for ninth 
overall. 

"[The JV] finished the season 
strong and did what they wanted to 
do," Novice Coach John Wang said. 
"[N ovice] had a bad heat, but they 
had a solid win over Colorado in 
the final." 

Courtesy of tile crew team 
Stroker: Senior stroke oar Sam Nichols (first rower), led the varsity eight boat to the third-fastest tim~ in California last weekend. 

Filippone was happy with the 
effort. 

"When you have guys coming 
in and rowing well ... it builds 
momentum," Filippone said. 

As well as they rowed, the Tri-
tons will have a different look next 
season. 

"We're losing a couple people 
and a couple of people are taking 
time off, so four people will be new 
for next year," veteran Jeff Diggler 
said. "The potential is there. Mike's 
just got to coach those guys at the 
same level." 

Most notable among those who 
will be lost is Sam Nicols. Nicols, a 
fourth-year rower, is stroke oar, the 
most significant seat on the boat 
and a recognized position of lead-
ership. 

Strong stroking and, more 
importantly, mental tenacity are 
requisite for this position, and find-
ing a replacement will be a chore. 

The entire off-season wiIJ be 
important to the men, as it is when 
a team can make advances. 

In such a team-oriented sport it 
is tough to make big advances or 
score upsets; if a team is slow in the 
beginning of the year, it is difficult 
to improve as the year goes on. 
Practicing from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. 
every weekday since September 
demonstrates the determination 
that is necessary for success in 
crew. 

"It's all pure equity," Filippone 
said. "If you don't put that time and 
effort in, you already know you're 
slow." 
Women'. Wrap-up 

For the women's side of the 
team, it was a different scenario.

Where the women expected to do 
well, they did. Where they hoped to 
step up and compete, however, they 
fell short. 

Women's crew is a different 
competitive environment than 
men's. The women's program at 
UCSD is NCAA-accredited, while 
the men are regulated by the same 
body that governs the Olympic 
team. Typically, women's programs 
receive more funding and there 
were many more boats competing 
at the PCRC than in the men's 
competition. 

The large field proved too com-
petitive for a number of Triton 
boats, especially for the varsity 
women, who were trapped among 
the big boats. 

In the open varsity division, 
women compete against any size 
category. This proved to be a tough 
task, as the varsity eight failed to 
make it out of the heats. 

"It was a let down," Head Coach 
Jack Vallerga said. "They were a lot 
better crew than that race showed." 

However, there were many shin-
ing moments for the women. The 
varsity four finished second in the 
Petite Final, good for eighth overall 
among 20 schools and fourth in the 
WlRA. 

The lightweight boats continued 
to excel, capturing second overall 
in the eight-seat boat behind USD 
and third in the fours, finishing 
behind rivals SDSU and University 
of San Diego again. 

"We came in second for State 
Championships, so we were just 
looking again at USD," rower 
Augusta Good said. "There were a 
lot of tearns that we had never 
seen." 

Among the two novice eight-
seat boats, the "A" boal did not get 
out of the heats, but the "B" boat 
finished second in the Petite, good 

for eighth overall . The novice four ' 
took fifth in the Petites, while the 
novice lightweight four took third 
overall. 

The women lose a multitude of 
rowers this year, including senior 
captains Alex Cornell and Adriane 
Wessels. 

Between the varsity open and 
lightweight boats, the women wiIJ 
lose eight of the 16 starting rowers. 
The Tritons are a deep team, how-
ever, and with solid novice coaches 
Darcie Tilly and Jennifer Woodard 
backing up Val/erga, the women 
hope to make another strong run 
next year. 

"We've got about four experi-
enced freshmen coming in," Valler-
ga said. "There's no reason to 
eltpect us to be slower next year. 
Crew is very much a team sport. [It 
is) a year of very intense effort that 
pulls people together. I'm proud of 
them aiL"

Results of the Sun 
God Olympiad 

As I reminisce on the most 
recent Sun God, my mind is 
clouded over with thoughts of 
mixed drinks and competition . 
I'm not talking about the Sun 
God sports festival, however, 
even though it does entail the 
impossible task of waking up 
Saturday at 8:30 a.m. 

No, I'm talking about the 
inflatable playground that 
inhabited the Muir Field in the 
shadow of the Sun God itselr. 
My entire Friday afternoon was 
spent running to and fro 
between the rides, experiencing 
the drunken exhilaration of 
competition while playing like a 
child. I never even got down to 
the Library Walk because I was 
having too much fun. 

My day was filled with highs 
and lows as I competed against 
the best in the business. For 
those of you who missed the 
afternoon at Muir, let me 
explain. There were at least 
three inflatable contests for 
everyone to compete on against 
your friends, intoxicated as you 
may be. 

At the playground was a 
huge inflatable boxing ring with 
oversized gloves, an inflatable 
obstacle course and a ride that 
can only be described as a 
bungee run. On this last ride, 
you wrapped a huge bungee 
cord around your waist and tried 
to get as far away from the start-
ing point as possible. The way 
to measure your progress was to 
stick a Velcro baton as far up as 
you could on another strip of 
velcro which ran the length of 
the ride. 

This bungee run was my first 
experience at Sun God and I 
was a miserable failure. 

The UCSD 

men's varsity-

eight boat 

became the 

fastest boat 

in school 

history

Sometimes the stars align just 
right. Sometimes you get the big 
end of the wishbone. Sometimes 
you can find a 
spot in East Park-
ing in the after-
noon. 

When your 
dreams and goals 
are realized, it 
often means Lady 
Luck had a hand 
in it. 

How'ever, for the men's varsity 
crew team, there was little luck 
about last Sunday's performance. 
In finishing fifth overall and first in 
the Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association (WIRA) at the Pacific 
Coast Rowing Championships in 
Sacramento last weekend, the men 
saw a season of hard work culmi-
nate in a dramatic fashion. 

"We've been rowing really well 
recently," second-year varsity 
rower Paul Dodge said. "We knew 
we had a really good chance to 
make history." 

So it wasn't exactly unexpected. 
Going into the event, the men's var-
sity eight-seat boat was ranked fifth

To demonstrate that they . 
deserved such a ranking, though, 

The focus that has driven the 
team all year let the men take sec-

best of the west 
coast in the season 
finale. 

Just to qualify 
for the finals of the 
PCRC is a chal-
lenge. Only two 
teams from each 
heat make it to the 
Grand Final. Last 
year, the men fin-
ished seventh over-
all and third in the 
WlRA. 

In its heat this 

final. 
UCSD's men 

have never gotten 
that far - until 
Sunday. But in a 
season filled with 
firsts, the best was 
yet to come. 

The Grand Final 
featured the six 
fastest boats on the 
western seaboard: 
Cal, Washington, 
Oregon State, Stan-
ford, Western 
Washington and 
UCSD.

SDSU have been continually We tern Washington had raced a

nipping at the Tritons' heels, for~- a bigger bunch of rowers . than 
ing UCSD to concentrate on sur- UCSD. However, the Tritons have 
viving the qualifier before even relied upon superior technique all 

season to beat bulkier opponents, 
and this race would be no excep-
tion. 

A slight head wind during the 
race aided the Triton cause, as 
those with a more technically 
refined stroke can better battle 
gusts of wind. 

Sheer muscle just doesn't cut it, 
and the Western Washington boat, 
facing the Tritons for the first time 
this year and featuring four novice 
racers, learned that lesson the hard 
way. 

The Tritons knew they had to go 
full-bore all race to beat these big 
guys, and at the I,OOO-meter mark 
the race was neck and neck. 

The race remained close 
throughout, as the Tritons kept their 
one-seat margin to win by slightly 
under a second, 6:06.08 to 6:06.57. 
With this fast time, the men fin-
ished only five seconds behind 
Stanford and eight seconds off Ore-
gon State, which is ranked in the 
top 20 in the nation. 

"We don' t have the huge com-
fed guys that a lot of teams have," 
Dodge said. "That was the most 
painful, hard-fought race I've ever 
been in." 

See HISTORY, Page 23 

I felt I had a huge advantage 
over the lazy slob who lined up 
next to me but I was beaten 
handily each time. I watched as 
he went just a bit father each 
time, then I was yanked violent-
ly back into the inflatable wall. 
An investigation of this ride 
some time later found that the 
lane he was in had a bungee 
cord about a foot longer than 
mine. So much for fair competi-
tion. 

I vowed to do better in the 
next event, which I felt could 
not be rigged - the ob tacle 
course. Taking a mighty swig 
from my "Gatorade" bottle, I 
challenged the filthy guy who 
had just bested m in bungec. 
He gladly accepted and we both 
stumbled for the maze of air-
filled plastic wrap. 

Men"s Volleyball Coach McFarland Resigns

FOCUS: Fonner SDSU 
star will stay on as the 
women's team coach 
By Travll Hili 
Sports Editor 

For the last two s a ons, Dun-
can McFarland has performed a 
rare double - he was at the helm 
as the head coach for the UCSD 
men's and women's volleyball 
squads. 

The only other coach at UCSD 

that is currently pulling off the dou-
ble is Denny Harper, who is the 
head coach of the men's . 
and women's water polo 
programs. 

It was a strenuous 
undertaking for McFar-
land, but both teams 
enjoyed tremendou uc-
cess under his watchful 
guidance. 

He was rewarded for 
his outstanding work this year as 
his women's tearn won the Nation-

al Championship. 
Yesterday McFarland resigned 

as the coach of the men's 
team. Coaching both 
team is a difficult job, 
especially for omeone as 
thorough as McFarland. 

He cited the split of 
time as the rea on for his 
resignation. 

His desire to devote all 
of his time and effort to 

one team led him to the decision. 
McFarland will remain at UCSD as 

the head coach of the women's 
team. 

The UCSD Athletic Department 
was unprepared for the announce-
ment. 

"It came as a surprise," UCSD 
Sports Information Director Bill 
Gannon aid. "But in athletics, a 
deci ion like this is never unexpect-
ed." 

UCSD director of athletic 
Judith Sweet said a search for a 
new men 's volleyball coach will 
commence immediately.
