SDSU replaces controversial mascot 
with an 'ambassador' of Aztec culture 
By MELODY GONZALES 
Contributing Writer 

San Diego State University's 
Ambassador Montezuma replaced 
the school's former mascot, Monty 
Montezuma, and made its debut at 
Rosa Parks Elementary School on 
Jan. 23 . 

In 1925, SDSU adopted the 
Aztec nickname. The Monty 
Montezuma mascot appeared in 
1941 , but last fall both the nick-
name and the mascot became a 
heated topic of campus debate. 

During the 2000-2001 school 
year, the Native American Student 
Alliance at SDSU criticized the rep-
resentation of Aztecs and the Aztec 
emperor as the red-faced Monty 
Montezuma mascot dressed in a loin 
cloth, throwing spears and pumping 
up the crowd during halftime at 
football and basketball games. The 
group claimed that the logos, images 
and representations of Monty 
Montezuma were dehumanizing and 
degrading to indigenous cultures.

Medical school decides 
to do away with honors 
grades for first quarter 
Academic Senate cites desire to 
ease transition for new students 
By DANIEL WArn 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Academic Senate 
voted to eliminate the honors des-
ignation from the first quarter of 
medical school in the core curricu-
hun in an effort to ease the transi-
tion from undergraduate status and 
to relieve pressure on medical stu-
dents. 

The honors grade will become 
ava ilable after the first quarter of 
the first year. 

"The faculty put the proposition 
forward and consulted with stu-
dents," said Director of Student 
Affairs Deborah Anderson. "[The 
pro position] was sent to the 
Academic Senate for final 
approvaL" 

The previous grading system 
had been one in which the work of 
students in classes constituting the 
core curriculum and fourth-year 
clinical internships would be 
reported as honors, pass or fail. 

The proposal , which amended 
Regulation 503 of the school of 
medicine, was enacted because of 
the unique challenges associated 
with the first quarter of medical 
school. 

The Academic Senate said 
some first-year medical students 
are at a disadvantage, having taken 
only the required prerequisite ci-
ence classes as an undergraduate, 
while other students completed 
many first-quarter medical classes

Connerly, Moores team 
up on racial initiative 
Proposal would bar racial disclosure for 
state agencies, UC to be included 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

UC Regent Ward Connerly i 
behind an initiative that would ban 
state agencies, including the 
U niversity of California , from col-
lecting racial and ethnic data. 

T he Racial Privacy Initiative, if 
passed, will enact an amendment to 
California's state constinltion that 
will effectively prohibit classifying 
"any individual by race, ethnicity, 
color or national origi n in the 
operation of public education, pub-
lic contracting or public employ-
ment" within the state of 
California, \vith limited exception. 

Connerly and the American 
Civil Rights Coalition authored the 
initiative. 

In the past , Connerly has been 
relatively successful in his crusade 
to eliminate affirmative action and 
racial classi fica tion in public agen-
cies. 

RPI is the first initiative of its 
kind that would virUlally phase out 
almost all racial c1assi fications 

made by the state government. 
However, the initiative does 
exempt medical research, law 
enforcement, and the Deparrment 
of Fair Employment and Housing, 
all of which may continue to speci-
fy individuals by race "lawfully. " 

Kevin guyen, a spokesperson 
for the ACRC, said the initiative is 
a progressive step in race relations. 

"It 's much more productive and 
wufying to end this arbitrary and 
artificia l system of racial classifica-
tion," N~yen said. 

After serving on the UC Board 
of Regents for two ye<lr , Connedy 
authored Standing Policy I in 
1995, the resolution that prohibit-
ed race to be a systematic basis for 
an applicant's admission to the 
University of California. After SP-
Is passage in July 1995, Connedy 
chaired the California Civil Rights 
Initiative, which passed as 
Proposition 209 in November 
1996. 

Proposition 209 banned any 
preferential trearment on the basis 
of race in the hiring and admission 

of individual in local and ,tarc 
governments and schoob. 

SP-I was rescinded ill .\ 1.1\ 
2001, but Proposition ~O<) I~ ,nil 
state law. 

Since the campaign for RPI wa 
launched in April 100 I, the L C 
Office of the President has not 
taken a position on the propo;,al. 
According to Hanan J. Eisenman, 
UCOP media coordll1alOr of 
admissions, the voluntarr ques-
tionnaire regarding the applicant's 
ethnicity on the UC application is 
used to "help identify trends III 
enrollment.' 

Nguyen cites the university's 
ongoing use of racial statistics as 
one of the factor that motivated 
Connedy to spearhead the initia-
tive. 

"What [Connerly] saw as a pol-
icy maker at VC was an obsession 
over racial classification, such as 
the check-boxes that continue to 
appear on admission applications," 
Nguyen said.

Mascot: 
Commission felt that Monty 
was too offensive to be mascot 
Continued from page 1 

In response to the complaints, 
SDSU President Stephen Weber 
decided rhat rhe university would 
continue its affiliation with the 
Aztec culture and Montezuma (the 
Aztec warrior and king in the 
15005). 

Weber appointed a student and 
alumni task force to investigate the 
issue. That task force recommended 
that rhe name "Monty," the red-faced 
depictions of the Aztec emperor, and 
other I ative American images be 
dropped from school logos. The task 
force also suggested that the updated 
school symbol be used to develop 
activities celebrating the Aztec cul-
ture. 

The effort to remove the demean-
ing representations of the former 
Monty Montezuma is in part due to 
the Apri l 200 1 statement of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights about 
the Lise of ative American images 
and nicknames as sports symbols. 
The statement said that "the use of 
stereotypica l images of ative 
Americans by educational insti tu -
tions has the potential to create a 

r~cially hostile educational environ-
ment that may be intimidating to 
In(han students." 

The commission also sta ted that 
although symbols and images offen-
si,'c to blacks have been eliminated 
,ince the Civil rights movement of the 
I <)60s, Native-American nickname 
:Inti imagery continue to be used by 
m3ny schools <Ind professional sports 
teams, despite the fact that many 
members of the American Indian 
community feel the representations 
arc a mockery of their religion and 
cu lture. 

American l11dia ll leaders, groups 
and the commission sa id Native 
American representations in educa-
tional institutions are inaccurate dis-
tortions that perpetuate harmful 
stereotypes and encourage biases and 
prejudices against contemporary 
Indian people. 

While some argue that school 
mascots are a trivial matter, the com-
mission maintains that "the fi ght to 
eliminate Ind ian nicknames and 
images in sports is only one front of 
the larger battle to eliminate obsta-
cles that confront American 
India ns." 

1n the case of SDSU, the contro-
versy about the Aztec nickname and 
mascot was the subject of discussion 
throughout San Diego. The student 
body voted to keep the Aztec nick-
name and Monty Montezuma as a 
mascot, but the University Senate 
voted to keep the nickname while 
altering the mascot. 

T he final decision was made by 
Weber, who agreed that the Aztec 
name should be kept as a symbol of 
the values of strength, valor and intel-
lectual achievement, but the mascot 
needed to be altered. 

Holly Poe Durbin, assistant profes-
sor of cosnlme design in the SDSU 
theater department, along with Maria 
Butler, a lecturer for the SDSU 
Chi cana/Chicano studies department, 
conducted research to develop the 
more respectable and authentic 
Ambassador Montezuma. 

The ambassador will now take on 
the function of education and out-
reach in SDSU's effort to respect and 
celebrate the Aztec culture. 1nstead 
of running and cheering during half-
time, the new ambn sador will greet 
visitors at sporti ng events and edu-
ca te the public about the Mexican 
Aztl!c cui ture, from the 
Mesoamerican trad itions to the his-
torical significance of the new 
$ 12,500 attire. 

SDSU is not the only San Diego 
educational institution to change its 
mascot in response to the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Right's state-
ment. 

Southwestern Community 
College in hula Vista, Calif. 
recently changed its mascot from the 
Apache to the Jaguar, but with less 
controversy than SDSU.

UCSD to set up tech center in 
San Diego neighborhood 

UCSD will be opening a new Community 
Te~hnology Center in San Diego's Chollas View 
neighborhood that will serve to provide computer 
access to area residents while also developing 
computer education and academic achievement 
at Gompers Secondary School. 

The facility is made possible by a $280,000 
grant from the u.s. Department of Education to 
UCSD's Student Educational Advancement office. 
UCSD undergraduates will serve as tutors as part 
of the project. Also, Qualcomm employees will 
serve as volunteer computer science tutors at the 
facility. 

The facility will be physically located at 
Gompers with additional services and classes 
available at other Chollas Vie-N sites, 

UCSD has used tutoring via webcam and inter-
active software at Gompers since early 2001. The 

un~versity claims that the program has significant-
ly Increased students' motivation in mathematics 
and science while also improving their math skills. 

Chollas View residents are expected to benefit 
from the center by preparing for college entrance 
exams, using online job referral databases and 
learning how to use age-appropriate educational 
software with their children. 

The project is part of an ongoing partnership 
between UCSD, San Diego Unified School District, 
Gompers Secondary School, California Student 
Opportunity and Access Program, and the 
Youth@Work program. 

Berkeley-NASA satellite 
project ready for launch 

After an extended delay, the launch of a satelÂ· 
lite that will analyze violent explosions over the 
surface of the sun is scheduled for Feb. 5. The 
study is a joint venture between UC Berkeley and 
NASA. 

The project entails use of the High Energy Solar 
Spectroscopic Imager, which was developed by a 
panel of international scientists based at Berkeley. 
The HESSI will embark on a three-year mission 
where it will examine high-energy x-ray and 
gamma ray emissions from gigantic explosions in 
the sun's atrnosphere called solar flares . 

While there have been satellites capable of 
observing flares by means of x-ray and gamma 
rays, HESSI will be the first project to take pictures 
using gamma rays and the highest-energy x-rays. 

The total cost of the HESSI mission is about 
$85 million. HESSI is the sixth Small Explorer 
spacecraft in NASA history and was originally 
scheduled to depart in July 2000. The mission has 

su~ered . del~ys due to damages to the satellite 
dunng Vibration tests, as well as several instances 
of launch vehicle failure. 

Scripps starts ocean acoustic 
research project in Hawaii 

Scientists with t~e Northern P<lcific Acoustic 
Laboratory at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography began a project to study the large-
scale acoustic thermometry last week discovered 
off of the Hawaiian island of Kauai. 

The project will also serve to analyze the 
behavior of sound transmissions in the ocean over 
long distances, as well as the possible long-term 
effects of sound transmissions on marine life. 

NPA~s research will require the use of a sound 
source installed on the ocean floor about 8 miles 
off shore. The project will also utilize aerial surveys 
to track the distributions and quantities of hump-
back whales and other marine life that could pos-
sibly be affected by underwater sound transmis-
sion, 

The study is in conjunction with the University 
of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory and is 
funded by the Office of Naval Research. For more

â€¢â€¢ UNIVERSITY CENTERS 



By WILSON CHEN 
Contributing Writer 

An issue pertinent to the 
University of California has 
prompted me to ask once again: 
What does it take to be a 
Californian? The question confuses 
many former immigrants and out-
of-state studen ts attending UC 
schools. 

The search for an answer begins 
with $14,933. That is the average 
yearly UC tuition for international 
and out-of-state students. It makes 
parents cri nge and forces many stu-
dents to work or be much more 
frugal than their peers. I am paying 
this price, so I ca n gripe. 

The lines have not been drawn, 
but the California Stare Assembly 
passed a bill Jan. 17 allowing undoc-
umented immigrants with proven 

aliforrua tics to be eligible for the 
same tuition as California residents 
at UC campuses. The reputable uni-
versity system is finally in tune with 
state and junior colleges, which have 
already guaranteed the lower tuition 
due to a previous sta te law. 

True Californians must be "res-
idents," right) I consider myself a 
resident; I live here. Immigrants, 
documented or not, are also resi-
dents. But state law provides them 
with no support in secondary edu-
cation, because there are clauses 
and strings attached. One must 
show "proven California ties." 

1 cannot understand why undoc-
umented immigrants deserve such 
grace. I cannot overlook the fact 
that nonimmigrant, out-of-state 
students also receive the same priv-
ileges in this plan. Under this law, 
all students who have lived in 
California for at least three years, 
and who are California high school 
graduates and have applied for or 
already possess legal status, would 
be eligible for the much lower in-
state tuition. 

To further review the matter, 1 
will take the example of myself. 
Although I was overseas for my 
middle school and high school 
years, I am a U.S. citizen. I lived in 
California for nine years and my 
parents own a house in the Bay 
Area. Yet at UCSD, 1 cannot pay

the resident tuition rate. 
With the decision to give immi-

grants and out-of-state students 
more bang for their buck comes 
great strides toward a more bal-
anced system. 

I have read that the Assembly 
needed a lot of time to decide 
because of legal, financial and 
moral issues . That last one must be 
a joke, because we all know how 
many Californians feel about those 
Mexicans supposedly stealing 
across the border by night. Judging 
by the fact that some of them cross 
the border at 4 a.m. and go back 
late in the evening, rewarding some 
of their cohorts who have settled 
down on the good side is not such 
an immoral thing to do. Just 
beca use they crossed the border for 
the long-term does not mean they 
work any less hard. They are a 
blessing to many industries, with 
the amount of effort they put in for 
such pitifully low wages. 

The UC Regents want liability 
protection, which is understandable. 
The only financial concern is the 
possible $2 million to $4 million

change that might bite into their six-
digit salaries. If they are so concerned 
about that, they can just raise dle 
overall in-state tuition fee slighdy. 

There are thousands of situa-
tions similar to mine, each with a 
valid argument for getting a tui tion 
break. I am impressed by the atti-
tude of the Assembly and the 
regents in extending consideration 
to a larger entity of students. At 
least the policy guarantees that stu-
dents with near-4.0 grade point 
averages will not be excluded for 
lack of documentation. 

Since most applicants are docu-
mented, according to sources, there 
should be litde trouble implement-
ing this plan. History is on the side 
of the opponents, though. A 1985 
court ruling stating that undocu-
mented immigrants should receive 
the same tuition benefits as legal 
California residents was reversed 
soon after its inception. 

In the meantime, I will continue 
to support lower tuition fees for 
those who have been here too long 
to not be honored with California 
residency.

Rodeo 
â€¢ â€¢ IS Inane 
animal 
cruelty 
Sport should 
not be an 
Olympic 
event 
By ALEX â€¢â€¢ LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Twenty years ago, I was born 
in Texas. Even today, when I 
think of the Lone Star State, I 
have a vision of open country, 
where cowboys eat steak and 
eggs before a hearty day of rop-
ing anything with four legs. 

Sadly, most people have a 
ridiculously roman tic view of 
Texas. Some people are almost 
as deluded as 01' Dubya himself, 
thinking that this is the way li fe 
ought to be, especially in Texas. 
These are the same people who 
consider a rodeo a legitimate 
sporting event. That is a truly 
frightening thought. 

As part of a showcase to 
demonstrate to the rest of the 
world what is supposedly great 
about America, the 2002 Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee 
decided to bring the sorriest 
spectacle of human ignorance 
and animal cruelty to the 
Olympics. 

The American rodeo will be 
presented as a contest between 
dle Canada Professional Rodeo 
Association and the Professional 
Rodeo Cowboys Association, to 
be h"ld at the Davis County 
Legacy Center in Utah . 

If you aren't already scared 
by the thought that a profes-
sional organization exists to 
back this dung, there's some-
thing wrong with you. It's bad 
enough that heartless individu-
als occasionally stage these 
events; it is worse that people 
form "professional associations" 
that try to legitimize this impos-
tor of a sport. 

People who think rodeos are 
cool because they evoke, rather 
graphically, tile image of the 
"Old West" - where the good 
cowboy partakes in old-fash-
ioned hobbies such as ropin' and 
ridin ' - arc stuck in a twisted 
time-warp. 

Rodeo's appeal is the same as 
that of wrestling, the most pop-
ular "sport" in America today. 
Nobody cares that it's fake and 
that the wresders are just actors 
- albeit grotesquely buff ones 
- paid to choreograph elabo-
rate, phony fights for an audi-
ence. The difference for 
wrestling is that participation is 
voluntary for the wrestlers and 
that they are paid. 

Rodeos are not real , and the 
animals aren't paid. That crazy, 
bucking bull trying to knock off 
the "cvÂ·.Â·,boy" is not doing it just 
for kicks. The truth is that, 
much like bullfighting, the ani-
mals are conditioned into being 
scared into a frenzy. 

"Cowboys" and handlers 
shove electric prods into the 
animals, kick them with their 
spurs, twist tllcir necks and ver-

A.S. president responds to accusations 
Council's aim is to best serve the needs of a diverse student body 

T his year's Research Review, 
an annual event at the 
UCSD Jacobs School of 
Engineering, is titled 
"Sensor Networks for 
Healthcare, the 
Environment and 
Homeland Defense:' 

The Research Review promises 
to be a great and heady demonstra-
tion of what the graduate students 
here are capable of, as it is every 
year. However, the title for this 
event is interesting, emphasizing 
"homeland defense." 

"Homeland" is a tricky word. Its 
use these days is attributable to 
President George W. Bush's cre-
ation of a lofty rank within his 
administra ti on, tile "Director of 
the Office of Homeland Security." 
"Homeland" and "domestic" are 
synonymous, but "domestic" is far 
more common, so it seems odd that 
Bush would choose the former. 

There seems to be a certain fun-
damental arrogance behind "home-
land" - implying the superiority of 
this particular nation-state's 
domestic territory. If this seems far-
fetched, let us remember that Nazis 
referred to Germany by the similar 
term "fatherland ." 

"Homeland," as opposed to 
"domestic," makes a point about the 
quality of the soil on which our 
nation rests, rather than the territo-
rial bounds of the soil itself. In addi-
tion, there is an imperialistic nature 
about it. It implies that there is a

Editor: 
On Jan. 28, 2002, I awoke to 

find Guardian writer Ryan 
Darby's opinion article , titled 
"Leaning to the left wing," 
inflammatory, derogatory, disre-
spectful, untruthful, deceitful and 
altogether a defamation of my 
character. 

I'm writing in hopes of

addressing not the personal poli -
tics and motivation behind such a 
conservative and extreme article, 
but to shed light on my involve-
ment (or lack thereof, rather) in 
the entire process of the resolu-
tion in question. I intend for this 
letter to be my final words on this 
matter. 

When approached in early 
November by the Freedom 
Alliance - a coalition of student 
organizations including the 
Califor71ia Review, College 
Republicans and Conservative 
Union - with the "Pro-America 
Resolution ," my only concern 
from the beginning was its title. 

The A.S. Council, in the 
interest of representi ng the stu-
dent body of UCSD, seeks to be 
as politically neutral and nonpar-
tisan as possi ble. Admittedly, we 
have passed and will continue to 
pass resolutions affirming the 
rights of people in the United 
States to access higher education 
via financial ai d, ad miss ions 
reform and so fo rth , but in no 
way, shape or form have we ever 
identified our initiatives directly 
with a political affiliation. 

The initial resolution, includ-
ing the title, was directly linked to 
the Freedom Alliance 's efforts in 
the "Pro-America Rally and 
Campaign," which concerned me. 

The students have a right to a 
nonpartisan A.S. Council, which 
only takes political stances on 
issues affecting students on cam-
pus, in the University of 
California and in the United 
States. Direct affiliation with a 
partisan effort, regardless of 
which side, is something that I 
will continue to fight against. 

You are welcome to attend any or all of the sessions. 

Individual applicants (1 each meeting) 
will be available

All sessions will be held in RIMAC 
in the Fourth Floor Conference Room . 

On the notion of politics in 
the A.S. Council, I feel tha t it is 
important for the students of 
UCSD to know that in represent-
ing you all on local, systemwide 
and national levels, we only take 
stances that work in the best 
interests of our constituents. The 
A.S. Council will never and 
should never directly affiliate 
itself with a politica l party. It 
should take every student issue at 
face va lue, measuring the effect 
and worth of all sides before 
asserting a position. 

Darby's article frames me as 
"un-American" and compares me 
to communist and socialist lead-
ers. The bases for these accusa-
tions are fa lse and inaccurate. As 
stated previo usly, my involve-
ment and concerns stemmed no 
furth er than the title of the reso-
lution. I felt it was the responsi-
bility of the A.S. Senate, being 
the only 20 students voting on 
this legis lation - yes, thar 's 
right; I don't actually vote on the 
A.S. Council - to address any 
concerns students had regardi ng 
the resolution 's content. 

With the direct involvement 
of the College Democrats, who 
had been raising serious concerns 
over the resolution from the 
beginning, the A.S. Senate coop-
eratively worked with the 
Freedom Alliance to effectively 
redirect the legislation from its 
partisan nature to a position 
more representative of all stu-
dents. This was not an effort to 
devalue, disgrace, disrespect or 
disapprove of the: United States. 

The structure of the A.S . 
Council is based on that of the 
U .S. government. How could we, 

as student leaders and reprcsen-
tatives, hate America' This 
notion is absurd and unfound ed. 
No one on the Â·A.S. Council -
not Vice President Internal Jenn 
Brown, Vice President External 
Dylan DeKervor, me or anyone 
else - has ever articulated a 
hatred toward America . 

D arby, in conjunction with 
the authors of the resolution, 
seems all of a sudden to have 
developed some sort of standard 
by which individuals are mea-
sured to be "un-American ." As 
intelligent students and people, 
one cannot deny the ironic corrc-
lation the term "un-American ," 
as used here, has to McCarth),ism 
during the Red Scare. Is our cam-
pus initiating a committee on 
"un-American activities?" Is our 
nation, no doubt already suffer-
ing from the tragedy of Sept. 11, 
2001, goiEg to start weeding our 
citizens and offi cials alike fo r 
alleged "un-American acti vi ties'" 

Students' concerns should not 
be directed toward me, but rather 
toward the politica l culture and 
divisiveness these extreme con-
serva tives are crea ting in a time 
when not only the campus but 
the nation requires unity. 

Last, I want to reassure the 
student body that the A.S. 
Council is wi ll ing and has always 
been willing to work cooperative-
ly with anyone to resolve out-
standing concerns people may 
have. I have taken Inore than 
enough time away from A.S. 
efforts to improve campus life to 
address th e issues surrounding 
this resolution.

great division between the numer-

So am I being unpatriotic by 
not declaring the United States 
the most superior nation on this 
planet? The morality. equality and 
freedom espoused by proponents 
of U.S. superiority are often clear-
ly lacking. The psyche of the all-
powerful. morally superior 
nation-state is a view more appro-
priate for a world of mercantilism, 
imperialism or world war. 

That's basically the SOrt of 
country we seem to advocate after 
Bush's State of the Union address. 
with his promises for unilateral 
trade action. unilateral troop 
placement in foreign nations. and 
his description of Iraq. Iran and 
North Korea as the "axis of evil." 

Twenty- first-century global 
democracy indeed. We might as 
well restore segregation while 
we're at it. 

We could have called the 
Research Review "Sensor

But that would mean admitting to 
our failings as a country and 
admitting to our fundamental 
moral equality with many other 
nation-states on this planet. 
wouldn't it) 

A mazingly en.oughâ€¢ the A.S. Council passed a resolu-tion relevant to UCSD 
students last week. informing the 

administration that students were 
unhappy about having photos on-
line. 

I tried to ascertain why exactly 
having photos of students that you 
hardly even bother to notice in 
lecture would be much help any-
way. So I thought of an analogous 
educational situation in which one 
was easily recognized. and tried to 
unearth the benefits of being 
anonymous there. 

High school. 

The morality, equality 
and freedom so 

espoused by 
proponents of U.S. 

superiority are often 
clearly lacking. The 

psyche of the all-

superior nation-state

appropriate for a 
world of mercantilism,

So. if I could have gone four 
years at Riverside Poly High with-
out a soul knowing my name upon 
sight. what would I have done? 

After careful consideration. I 
figured that I would steal the cam-
pus enforcers' golf cart and take it 
for periodic joy rides. There would 
be other benefits: I could get away 
with sleeping in class, have others 
take my tests and so on.

Affairs Joseph Watson has always 
been a big fan of bringing rowdy 
college kids into line. (Look at his 
current attempt to squash 
Groundwork Books. I wonder if 
the shed construction at the Che 
Cafe is his idea too. If one forces 
the Che to worry about 30 square 
meters on its lot. it won't make 
trouble elsewhere. I wonder how 
long this can be dragged out 
before the Che catches on .) The 
only benefit to having photos on-
line is for discipline. My theory 
seems to have been confirmed: 
Two of my professors have used 
them solely for identity verifica-
tion during exams. 

I'm not a fan of having a police 
state at a public university. but if 
the professors can use it to shut 
people up In class. I'm all for it. 
Maybe if there were actually some 
consequences to people's talking. 
like grade reduction. they'd keep 
quiet in lecture so the rest of us 
could hear. 

T he one week every quarter when Library Walk fills with the smell of kettle 
corn and the sounds of merchants 
blaring Dave Matthews Band and 
Johannes Brahms is a joy for the 
senses. In spite of what some peo-
ple deride as capitalists and hip-
pies invading campus grounds. it's 
a nice opportunity to buy useless 
junk. 

Now. if only someone had the 
sense to invite a low-cost comput-
er parts dealer to campus, I'd be 
ecstatic.

Proposal: 
Mixed feelings about the 
initiative at UCSD 
Continued from page 1 

Some studen t leaders at UCSD 
are not as positive about the initia-
tive. which would no longer allow 
the monitoring of race in university 
admission and hiring practices. 

A.S. Vice President External 
Dylan de Kervor said that UCSD is 
statistically the least racially diverse 
ca mpus in the UC system. and RPI 
would impede efforts to diversify 
th e snldent body. 

"WitilOllt information regarding 
the racial makeup of our campus. 
there is no way to tell how bad the 
situation really is." de Kervor said. 
"It lets [the University of California] 
off the hook because there will be no 
clear way of telling how the problem 
is being solved if there is no racial 
data to work with." 

UCSD Conservative Union 
President Vince Vasquez is support-
ive of Connerly's initiative. 

"Our polici es of education, 
employment and contracts should 
not delineate upon artificial. sociallv 
constructed notions of 'racial back'-
ground .... Vasquez said in a state-
ment. 

Nguyen contends that class ifica-
tion of race is irrelevant, and that 
society should work toward tracking 
people along nonracial lines. RPI. 
he says. is a step in that direction. 

De Kervor disagrees. saying 
ignoring race will not end discrimi-
nation. 

"Increasing diversity at UCSD is 
going to come by erasing racism. 
not race. " de Kervor said . 

Connerly l1Iust attain 670.5 J 8 
signamres by Jtme 27 for the initia-
tive to make the November 2002 
ballot as a state proposition. 

Last week the SOli Diego Ullioll-
7i-iblll7e reported that fell ow Regent 
John Moores held a fund-raiser for 
the initiative at his home in Rancho 
Santa pe. Connerl y appeared at the 
event. 

Moores. who is the majority 
owner of the San Diego Padres 
baseball club. donated $20 million 
to UCSD in 2000 for the construc-
ti on of the Rebecca and J ohn 
Moores Cancer Center. 

Phone call s left for Moores were 
not renlrned in time for publica-
tion . 

Grades: 
The summer program gives 
some students an advantage 
Continued from page 1 

before enrolling in the school of 
medicine. 

"People take the summer pro-
gram. which gives them an advan-
tage." said second-year medical 
student Debbie Fraind . "They just 
took the same course that's 
offered during the regular school 
year." 

For them, first-quarter classes 
are a review; but for others they 
contain new material. 

The school of medicine hopes 
to encourage cooperation among 
its students. and the elimination 
of the honors designation would 
de-emphasize competition and 
allow students to "acclimate to the 
new academic realities" of medical 
school. according to the Jan. 29 
"Report of the Faculty of the 
School of Medicine." 

"People who know more are 
going to be more likely to help 
people out and worry less about 
their own grades." said second-
year medical student Alice Lin. 

Another concern was the 
increased class hours compared to 
those of undergraduates, which 
could lead to more stress with an 
honors grading scheme. 

Critics have argued that while 
in medical school. students should 
do their best regardless of how far 
along they are wi th their studies, 
Anderson said.

When UCSD students toSS that glass

They just like that they don't have to carry

But consider what resulted from people 
keeping some of their waste out of the trash 
can over the last 10 years: 

Carbon dioxide emissions were reduced 
by over 140 million tollS_ 

Enough energy was conserved to supply 
all of the energy needs for every home in 
California for 18 months. 

More than 600 million trees were

10 FEATU RE ' THE UC D GUARDIAN 

Success came inÂ· San Diego, 
now Ralph Rubio gives back 
Rubio's founder got his start at a Pacific Beach stand 
and now uses his business skills to help the homeless 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Senior Staff Writer 

R:llph RubIO is nor a household 
n:llne like other res t3uraIH 
founders Dave Thol11as and 
Colone l anders. But the San 
Diego success sto ry behind 
Rubio's bmOlls tlsh tacos is inter-
esti ng indeed. 

While attcnding San Diego 
State University in the 19705, 
Ruhio was an indecisive college 
srudent debating what to do with 
his life. 

One thing, though, was clear. 
U[ always knew I wanted to own 

my own business," Rubio said. 
[I e knew that most new busi-

nesses fa il , so Rubio needed some-

now 136 Rubio's restauraIHS in 
tlve states. 

His most successful San Diego 
re tauraIH is the one on La Jolla 
Village Drive. [t is this success and 
the success of Rubio's branches at 
UCLA and DSU that prompted 
Rubio's to open a branch in the 
Price Center. 

Among the 136 stores, one 
Rubio's storefront stand out: The 
Cabo Cafe. It is a unique incarna-
tion of Rubio's Baja Grill, loca ted 
on the campus of Monarch High 
School at 808 W. Cedar St. in 
downtown San Diego. 

Monarch High School, which 
enrolls homeless and at-risk teens, 
was founded by San Diego teacher 
Sandra McBrayer in 1988. Serving 

between 60 and 75 thing to fall back 
on. 

'You have to have 
a great idea, you 

have to have 
passion and 

commitment: 

homeless teen-
agers at one tillle, 
Monarch High is a 
way out and a way 
up for many of the 
1,500 kids who call 
an Diego's so'eets 

homc. 

U[ thought [ 
\\'ou ld rea ll y enjo)' 
tt;achmg," Ruhio 
" lid. II";: majored 
111 lihera l studies, 
.1Il d enjoyed psy-
cho logy and 
Spanish classe~. 

Rubio ne\'er 
h,ld to fall back on 

-Ralph Rubio 
Founder of 

Rubio 's Baja Grill 

Rubio said the 
Cabo Cafe, which 
opened in October 
200 I, was "an idea that teJching 

c.lreer 
.tllhough his minor in Spanish has 
probJhl)' come in handy. 

T he Idea fo r Rubio's Baja Grill 
GllllC fro m weekend road tri ps and 

~rrillg breaks spent in the lv\exica n 
t1shll1g village of San Felipe . It was 
un .he beaches of San Felipe that 
Rubio sa w "tons of tl sh taco 
sta nds." Over the course of his 
trips, RubiO said that "all these 
gringos like myself' were chowi ng 
down on the Baja specialty. 

In I <)H3, with his father' help, 
Rubi o took over an old Orange 
Julius . ta nd in Pacific Beach and 
started scrving everything from 
french fries to calamari and, of 
course, fi sh tacos. 

"\\ 'e were winging it," Rubio 
said. "Sales were vcry low. It took 
about two yea rs to build the busi-
ness through wo rd of moutll ." 

I IOlVcver, Rubio was able to 
open his econd location on 
College Avellue soon a ftcI'. 

Rubio's has grown signific:lI1tly 
si nce it opened in PB. There are 

I carried around 
with me for the longest time." 

The Cabo Cafe is J fully func-
tionll1g restaurant and all proceeds 
help fund Monarch [ligh School's 
program . IIowever, the cafe also 
provides job training and entre- _ 
preneu riaJ skill s to the tlve 
Monarch students who work 
there. 

The snlden ts are selected by 
their teachers, but once they ar~ 
hired, they arc trcated as regular 
employees. 

" I have to treat it like a normal 
job for them," said Cabo Cafe gen-
cralmanager Stacey Coughlin. 

Coughlin also explained that 
working at the Cabo Cafe is meant 
to be a learning experiencc where 
creativity and imagination arc used 
more often than in a typi cal 
Rubio's branch . 

As a former San Diego surfer 
who once only dreamed about 
owning hi s own restaurant, 
Rubio's business know-how has 
been homegrown. 

Taco master: SDSU graduate Ralph Rubio picked up the secret of fish tacos on 
weekend trips to San Felipe. Now he contributes to San Diego's community 
through the Cabo Cafe, a Rubio's franchise staffed by homeless teens. 

Rubio said there arc six thing 
that are crucial to starting a succe s-
ful busi ness: "You have to have a 
!,'Teat idea, you have to have passion 
and commionent, you have to have 
ca pital. Have some experience, sur-
round yourself with smart people," 
and most importantly, "build your 
business with integrity." 

It is advice he offers to his 
employees at Monarch High and 
to anyone looking to starr a suc-
cessful business. 

While Rubio has recently spo-
ken in radio advertisements for 
Rubio's, he shies away from 
becoming larger-than-life. 

"1 always swore J would never 
be in tlle advertising," Rubio said. 

At the urging of his advertising 
team, he eventually caved - a lit-
tle. While you may hear Rubio's 
voice on your radio sometime 
soon, h e's still a long way from giv-
ing Colonel Sanders a run for his 
money.

Recycle: 
UCSD recycles 40 
percent of its waste 
Continued from page 9 

Recycling happens every day at 
UCSD. According to Krista 
Henkels, who is in charge of trash 
at UCSD Recycle , the campus 
recycles about 40 percent of the 
waste it produces. Recycling bins 
for aluminum cans, glass and plas-
tic bottles can be found all over 
campus, and are becoming as com-
mon as garbage cans. Henkels said 
that students are taking advantage 
of these and arc even requesting 
thllt more of them become avail-
able. Campus picnic tables are 
made from recycled content. Even 
some of our decks are made from 
recycled plastic lumber. 

However, despi te the efforts 
many are putting into recycli ng, 
Henkels said more c;ln still be 
done. 

Half of the trash from lecture 
halls is paper, which can easily be 
recycled. There are also many bot-
tl es and cans found in the trash in 
the Price Center. 

Although residence halls and 
campus apartments have recycling 
bi ns right outside, students have 
complained that it is inconvenient 
to use them. T hey note that it's nice 
to have them there, but say the only 
people who use them are those who 
arc strongly committcd to helping 
the environment. Everyone elsc 
would rather just throw their rccy-
clables into the trash, if it means 
they won't have to walk Ollt to the 
recycling bins. 

The same holds true for other 
parts of campus as well. People 
si mply find it easier to throw 
things in the trash because they 
don 't want to wait until they flnd :1 
recycling bin. 

However, UCSD practices nlso 
help reduce air pollution c3tlsed by 
hazardous chemicals. ChemCyde 
is the campus' chemica l reuse pro-
gram, which accepts donations of 
hazardous waste from all over cam-
pus. Every day, chemical waste is 
generated in research , administra-
tion and facility maintenance. Each 
year, almost 322,000 pounds of 
chemical waste is produced :It 
UCSD. About 100,000 pounds gets 
recycled. 

Waste is recycled and reused in 
several ways. 

For example, various parrs of 
fluorescent light tubes can be recy-
cled. The mercury is removed and 
redistilled . The aluminulll, brass 
and copper ends of the bulbs arc 
removed and resmeltered . The 
glass is reused as fiberglass felt.

Reuse: 
On-campus stores offer 
recycled goods 
Continued from page 10 

Oils are usually sent to a refin-
ery and redistilled into high-grade 
oils. Batteries are always recycled 
for the metal contained in them. 
Some paints are sent to be liquefied 
so they ca n be used as paint again. 
Metals, such as silver, lead and cop-

to be reused. 

hazardous waste problems. 
According to its environmental 

policy, UCS D wants to ensure 
that all activities on campus are 
done in a hea lthy, safe and envi-
ronmenta lly friendly manner. lts 
ultimate goal is to not have any 
environmental complia nce viola-
tions and it wants every part of 
campus to do its part in achi eving 
th is goa l. 

Many opportunities exist for 
students to go green. 

"Precycle" mugs can be pur-
chased at various campus food 

spots. T hese mugs 
per, are sent away 
Computer moni-
tors are recycled for 
their metals. 

In the past, 
many universities 
have been cited by 
the Environmental 
Protection Agency 
for keeping danger-
ous waste. Some 
were fined hun-
dreds of thousands 
of dollars because 
they cou ld not 
manage their waste 
safely. 

Recently, every 
campus in the UC 
system had to per-
form a self-audit to 
uncover problems 
with its hazudous 
waste. Results will 
soon be sent to the 
EPA. 

UCSD's audit 
did not uncover

reduce the amount 
of waste that goes 
into the garbage, 
and save money, 
since most mer-
chants give dis-
counts for refilling 
them. 

R ecycl ed items 
are avai lable at the 
UCSD Bookstore, 
the General Store, 
and other campus 
retailers. A lot of 
their paper prod-
ucts, binders, 
greeting cards, 
pens and T -shirts 
are made from 
recycled content. 

Advocates of 
recycl ing hope 
that students will 
take advantage of 

lems with its hazardous waste accu-
mulation areas. According to Clark 
Martin, manager of the 
Environmental Management 
Faci li ty, about 80 percent of the 
violations discovered in the audit 
were problems with labeling, an 
area tllOroughly regulated by fed-
erallaw. 

Unl ike some universities, 
UCSD has never been fined for 

these simple 
chances - from 

buying recycled to holding onto 
that soda can just a little longer in 
order to put it in a recycli ng bin 
instead of the trash - to redu ce 
the amount of waste that UCSD 
produces.

along with Heather Hea ron, Carly

the Pacific Collegiate Swim

Despi te the focu on the confer-
ence, McGihon was sa tisfied with 
his team's performance last week-

"On thc whole, I thought thcy 
raced extremely well and really 
stepped up to th e challenge," 
McGihon said. "We had some S\1r-

Tritons split against Concordia at home 
UCSD's Matt Smith hits three homeruns in two days 
ByANU KUMAR 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's baseball 
team continued its solid start to 
thjs young season in a busy week-
end of baseball, playing three 
games in only two days. 

In Friday's first game, UCSD 
played host to the Crusaders of 
Point Lama Nazarene University. 
The contest was suspended due to 
darkness after the runth inning 
with the score tied at 5-5 . 

The Crusaders jumped out in 
front early in the game, scoring 
fOllr runs in the first inning. 
Triton starting pitcher John 
Beaven walked three Point Loma 
batters, allowed three hits and 
threw one wild pitch in the first 
inning, contributing to the 
Crusaders' early lead. 

UCSD began its comeback in 
the third inrung when the team 
tallied one nm on an RBI ground-
out off the bat of left fie lde r John 
Bologna , which allowed second 
baseman Matt Merrifield 10 score. 

In the fifth inning, the lriton 
bat came alive. Right fielder 
David Hawk led off the inning 
with a single, then stole second. 
After Bologna e,)rned a walk, cen-
ter fielder Matt Smith tied the 
game at .f-.f with hjs first homenm 
of the scason - a line drive that 
sailed ovcr the right-field wall . 

The Crusaders took the lead 
again in the seventh. They scored 
one run off lJ-iton re liever 
Tommy Sereno. However, Point 
Loma's 5-4 advantage only lasted 
until Smith's next at-bat in the 
bottom half of the inning. He tied 

the game again with a solo home 
run down the right-field line. 

UCSD had at least one runner 
in eaeh inrung of the game, but 
the Tritons failed to take the lead. 
The game will be completed at a 
date yet to be determined. 

On Saturday, UCSD played a 
doubleheader at home against 
another nonconference oppo-
nent: the Eagles of Concordja 
University. 

In the first leg of the double-
header, the Tritons took the lead 
early and held onto it throughout 
the game. UCSD won the first 
match 11 -5. 

The scoring began in the sec-
ond inrung when shortstop Keith 
Hernandez and Hawk both singled 
to lead off the inning. Merrifield 
was hit by a pitch, loading the bases 
for Smith. The center fielder hit 
his third home run in two games, 
this one bei ng a grand slam that 
gave the Tritons a 4-0 lead. 

After UCSD added two more 
runs in the third inning, the 
Eagles began to battle back. The 
Eagle shortstop started his team 
off with a solo home run. Then 
with two outs, designated hi tter 
Eddie Nelson dou bled to the gap 
in right field to score two runs for 
Concordia. elson ta llied a run 
on a single by teammate Andrew 
D eleon. 

With one run in the fifth 
inn ing and four mo re in the 
eighth, the Tritons put th e game 
o ut of reach wi th the help of the 
bullpen. In almost six innings of 
work, UCS D 's starting pitcher 
all owed four runs, but relievers 
Loga n Boutilier, Andrew 

Holloway and J ames Sanders did 
not give up a run in three-and-
one-third innings. 

The Eagles managed to split 
the doubleheader and win the 
second game, which was only 
scheduled to last seven inrungs. 
Concordia's starting pitcher John 
Carreon left the game after fac ing 
just six batters in two innjngs, but 
the Eagles had strong relief work 
that only allowed one run on two 
hjts . 

All the scoring came in the 
third inrung. A pitch from UCSD 
starter Andy Hanau hit the Eagles' 
Justin Jennings, and then 
Concordias second baseman Chris 
Bowen walked. Both runners 
moved up one base on a wild pitch, 
and Jennings and Bowen came 
around to score on a two-out single 
off the bat of Triton catcher Hand 
Lobel. 

In the bo ttom half of the same 
inning, H ernandez hit an infield 
si ngle. H e scored when the 

Eagles' third baseman Ben 
Camacho made a throwi ng error 
while fielding a ground ball. 

The Tritons had their chances 
in the second game against the 
Eagles, but UCSD lacked the one 
key hit. The team left the bases 
loaded once, and in the seventh 
inning, the Tritons had the tying 
run reach second with no one alit 
but failed to bring him home. 

UCSD is now 3-2 and will 
face Point Lama agai n on 
Tuesday before o pening the 
2002 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association at home 
against Cal State Los Angeles on 
Thursday. 

Looking ahead to the upcom-
ing week, Smith commented, 
"We are playing good baseball 
right now, and we all aren 't even 
clicking on all cylinders. We are 
excited to be coming into confer-
ence play, and it will only be a 
matter of time until the team 
clicks together."

Women's basketball endures tough roadtrip 
Losses to Cossacks, Gators drop the Tritons to 6-8 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's ba ket-
ball team went into this weekend 
wi th a strong record of 10-7 and 
6-6 in conference play, but 
struggled on the road when it 
dropped two games to division 
opponents. 

On Feb. I, the Tritons trav-
eled north to San Francisco 
State University, lookjng to 
extend their winning streak to 
six games. 

As the first half played out, 
nothing seemed to be dropping 
for the Tritons while they made 
10 out of 33 attempts. The SFSU 
team shot a superior 12 of 29 
attempts, totaling 41.4 percent 
from the fi el d. 

The telling stat in the first 
half was that the Tritons went 0-
10 from three-point land . Yet at 
the end of the fi rst half, UCSD 
was only down by six points at 2S-
22 . 

The second half was more 
competitive, and UCSD and 

SFSU exchanged leads t hroug h-
out the ga m e. Yet th e Tritons 
co uld onl y shoot another 10-33 
from the field while the Gators 
shot an extraordinary 54.5 per-
cent on 12 makes of 22 
attempts. 

Each team made two threes in 
the second half and attempted six 
free throws . Down the stretch, 
the Tritons just couldn't handle 
the balanced scoring attack from 
the home team. The bench from 
SFSU out-scored UCSD's 
bench, 22-4, which was pivotal 
down the stretch. At the end of 
the game, San Francisco pulled 
away to win 57 -4S. 

Sophomore Ali Ginn was the 
leading scorer for the lritons 
with 14 points while adding nine 
rebounds to their total. Senior 
Maya Fok added nine points and 
three assists for UCSD. 

For SFSU, the scoring was 
very balanced with four players 
earning eight points or more. 
Kelley Kruger was the leading 
scorer for the Gators with 12 
points and nine assists. Sharee

Sykes added four points and eight 
rebounds to lead all the players all 
the boards. 

T he next day, the Tri tons' sec-
ond game of the roadtrip featured 
an amaz;ing comeback effort by 
Sonoma State University to 
defeat the Tritons, 54-49. 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team came out hot, making 
lOaf 24 attempts in the first 20 
minutes of play. Sonoma State 
wasn 't spectacular in the first half 
but played well to trail only by 10 
points going into halftime. The 
team made seven out of 20 shots 
(35 percent) with surprisingly no 
three-point attempts in the entire 
first half. 

The second half was not what 
UCSD expected when it let 
Sonoma State penetrate and 
drive to the basket, which ulti -
mately ended in free - throw 
a ttempts. Sonoma shot 27 free -
throws and made 22, an impres-
sive 81 percent from the line. 
UCSD made eight of 30 shots 
and an hnpressive three of eight 
from the three- point line . 

The 

Sonoma State was stm dismal 
from the fi eld, making six of 22 
shots, but the free-throw line 
was the pivotal element that got 
the Gators a lead they would not 
relinquish. 

Again, the bench from the 
opposing team outscored 
UCSD, and in this case, it was a 
23- 11 advantage for Sonoma 
State. In the end, UCSD could-
n't overcome the shooting dis-
play put on by Sonoma from the 
free- throw line, and the home 
team won 54-49 in a tough bat-
tle. 

Senior center Danyiel 
Wortham led the Tritons with 14 
points and six rebounds, whil e 
Ginn added 12 points for the 
cause. Elizabeth Carr led Sonoma 
State with 12 points off the 
bench, which contributed greatly 
to the victory. UCSD dropped to 
10-9 on the season and 6-S in 
conference play. 

The next game for the 
Tritons will be Feb. 8 against 
California State University 
Stanislaus.

In the first half, UCSD shot a low 
40 percent on 8-20 shooting, whi Ie 
SFSU shot a sizzling 53.6 percent on 15 
baskets on 28 attempts. SFSU built a 
lead in the first half and could have 
taken advantage of turnovers and 
missed shots by the Tritons, but the k,;y 
stat was free throws. The Tritons made 
nine of 12 attempts, while SFSU 
attempted four and lIl:tdc (mil' two.

" \ \ '<: wanted to win, hut we were 
Illure concerned With taking care 
of our own buslllcss tlrst. " 

Sophomore swimmer Carol yn 
J( \\ ok wasn 't particularly taken 
aback bv Saturdav's result.

\\'ou ldn't 'iay / was expecting it," 
sIlt: 'i,1Il1. "/ km:w we had :l lor of

conti d.:nt we would do better than

l ~n ioYlng the home advantage 
of Ca nvo nview Pool in their last 
hOllle in,ltch of the season, the 
Tritons won 10 out of the 16 total 
':H:ntS en route to their dominat-
II1g VICtory. 

The Tritons' 400-yard medley 
reby team of J ennifer vVatanabe, 

an~l ra Lopez, Frances Tran and 
Samantha Wong gave UCSD an 
early boost, netting II points for 
the Tritons. 

Lopez then went the solo track 
and picked up two individual vic-
tories, winning both the lOa-yard 
'lnd l Oa-yard breaststroke events. 

T he Tritons howed off their 
depth in the backstroke event as 
well , taking the top seven places in 
the IOO-yard competition and the 
top five spots in the 200-yard event. 

Senior Molly McCorkle also 
picked up a double victory for 
UCSD, pulling a backstroke 
sweep by winning both the 100-
ya rd and 200-yard backstroke 
events. 

"I knew their backstrokers 
wasn't their stronger event," 
,\lcGihon said . "Both andra and 
Molly are seniors, so it's nice they 
can go our as double event win-

Carolyn Kwok praised her 
teammates' performances as well. 

"Molly is a leader by example," 
she sa id. "She trains really hard 
and does well in competitions.

"[My sister and I] have just 
been swimming together for so

"We support each other a lot -
it's not like 'oh man my sister beat

Tritons head into league 
play with perfect record 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Contributing Writer 

The UCS D men's volleyball 
team picked up its first win of the 
season against PrincetOn University 
Jan . 30 before fa lling to Mountain 
Pacific League foes UC Irvine and 
UCLA over the weekend. 

Pri nceton came to UCSD for 
the third of four matches on its cur-
rent West Coast swing after drop-
ping its first two matches in 
~traight sets. 

The Tigers fared no better 
against the Tritons, dropping the 
lIrst game 30-2 1 due to strong serv-
ing and four aces by UCSD. 

The second game was marred by 
sloppy play on both sides, but 
UCSD managed to out-hit 
Princeton .448 to .083 and cruised 

to a 30- 18 victory. Despite an appar-
ent lack of effort from the Tritons in 
the third game and a late rally by the 
Tigers, UCSD held on for a 32-30 
\vin and the three-set sweep. 

Jim Waller led the Tritons with 
a hitting percentage of .722 and 14 
kills, while Chris Mortimer added 
10 and Jordan Hove dished out 49 
assists. 

"The Mountain Pacific is clear-
ly the best conference in the coun-
try," Princeton coach Glenn 
Nelson said. "UCSD has a lot of 
tough teams to come up against." 

The strength of the Mountain 
Pacific Conference was obvious 
after weekend visits from UCI and 
UCLA, both ranked in the top 10 
in the nation. 

Before the game, Triton head 
coach Ron Larsen addressed the

difficulty in playing a team like 
Irvine. 

"[VCI] is a real good team with 
a lot of motion in their offense. 
They do a lot of the little things 
very well," he said. "I want to see us 
come out there and compete hard 
and put some pressure on them and 
see what happens." 

The Anteaters opened the first 
game on a 5-0 run and never 
looked back, going on to a three-
game sweep (30-22,30-22,30-16). 
The Tritons played badly through-
out the match, passing poorly, hit-
ting only .103 and committing 
eight service errors to only one ace. 

The service errors killed several 
Triton rallies and disrupted any 
rhythm UCSD might have estab-
lished. 

Sophomore outside hitter Joe 
Griffin said the errors were "main-
ly mental and a result of not being 
aggressive. " 

UCI was plenty aggressive, hit-
ting an impressive .443 as a team 
and ending with three players in 
double figures for kills. The team 
also earned a total of 13 aces on tile 
night. 

Anteater coach Charlie Brande 
was pleased with the match, which 
was even more impressive consid-
ering the absence of senior middle 
blocker Erick Helenihi, whom 
some consider the best hitter in the 
college game. Brande said the deci-
sion not to play Helenihi was due 
to inconsistency this year. 

Going into their match with 
UCLA, the Tritons also had consis-
tency issues. When asked if he 
thought his team could beat 
UCLA, Griffin aid, "Potentially. If 
everything goes right." 

Everything was going right in the 
first game SanU'day night when the 
Tritons opened \vith incredible ener-
gy and built a 20-13 lead. But after a 
UCLA timeout, the Bruins went on a

UCSD softball squared off 
against Vanguard University in an 
intense doubleheader Feb. 2. 
Leea Harlan was on the mound 
for the Tritons and threw a no-hit 
shutout in the first game against 
the Lions, but this 1-0 victory 
wasn't easy. 

Both UCSD and Vanguard 
ba ttled in a scoreless tie until the 
Tritons scored the winning and 
only run of the game at the top of 
the seventh inning. 

UCSD led off the first inning 
and immediately took control 
with two hits off of Vanguard 
pitcher Gina Liebengood, who 
allowed only four Triton hits in 
the first game. In the third inning, 
UCSD tried to get something 
started by instituting and execut-
ing the short game. 

Triton third baseman Amy 
Mettee bunted and reached first 
base on an error by the Lions, and 
later advanced to second off of a 
ground out by UCSD left fielder 
Kristina Anderson. But this effort 
was to no avail. The next batter 
struck out and ended the inning. 
Defensively, Harlan continued to 
drop the Lions in succession as 
mey came to me plate. 

As the game was approaching 
the end of regulation, UCSD 
shortstop Kim Aggabao initiated 
the offensive attack and doubled 
in the top of the seventh inning. 
Sophomore Jamie Hurst followed 
by successfully executing a bunt 
that advanced Aggabao to third 
base. First baseman Martinelli 
proceeded to drive in Aggabao by 
smacking a shot to right center 
field, 

Vanguard threatened at the bot-
tom of the seventh. Third baseman 
Jill Jessen walked and then 
advanced to second base, which put 
her in scoring position for the 
Lions. The Tritons stayed tough 
and earned the victory when Lion 
Cheri Smith grounded out to third, 
ending the game. 

The second game began just as 
the first. 

The Tritons got two hits from 
Mettee and Harlan, who both sin-
gled off of Lion pitcher Marcia 
Ball in the top of the first. 

UCSD head coach Patti 
Gerckens gave freshman pitcher 
Keri Hanley the start. 

In the first, Vanguard's Ashley 
Mauro and Celina Camarillo took 
advantage of the inexperienced 
freshman and lined two shots of 
their own. Offensively, Triton 
Christi Martinelli singled to cen-
ter field in the third, while defen-
sively, pitcher Hanley tOok down 
the next three Lion batters. 
Martinelli entered the game and 
pitched five innings in relief for 
the Tritons. 

Things started heating up in the 
top of the sixth when, with one out, 
Triton Kristina Anderson doubled 
to left field. I-Iarlan then singled to 
left field and reached second base 
on the throw to the plate while 
Anderson rounded the bases and 
scored. Aggabao continued the 
Triton rally when she singled to 
right field, advancing Harlan to 
third. Right fielder Jamie Hurst 
then singled down the right field 
line. Harlan scored on the hit and 
Aggabao advanced to third. 

With two runners left on base, 
the Tritons popped up and struck
