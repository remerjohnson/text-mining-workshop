Members of the Student Voice! 
slate claimed a sweeping victory in 
last week’s campuswide election, cap-
turing all A.S. executive offices and 
six of eight senatorial seats.

SV!’s showing was less striking 
in college council races, but in A.S. 
Council contests, the slate’s domi-
nance was so pronounced that one 
of its candidates, David Henry 
Ritcherson, won one of the all-cam-
pus senator spots even after dropping 
from the race several weeks ago.

SV!’s success comes as no surprise 
in light of this year’s overwhelm-
ing number of unopposed races. 
However, when the results were 
announced on April 11, SV! can-
didates reiterated their enthusiastic 
commitment to council collaboration 
to increase student representation.

“I’m just looking forward to work-
ing with everyone,” SV! candidate 
and A.S. President-elect Donna Bean 
said. She said she is relieved that the 
campaign is over, and is excited to 
begin work beside her slate com-
panions.

Bean said her first two projects 
in office will be to compose the A.S. 
budget and institute a task force to 
evaluate the council’s constitution.

Newly elected Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani said he is determined to use 
council funds more efficiently this 
year to guarantee that student orga-
nizations receive adequate financial 
support.

“A couple decisions that we made 
this year with college festivals and 
Triton Tide really depleted A.S. 
funds, so we’re going to try and be 
smarter with our money and make 
sure that student org funding is a 
priority for us, as well as saving the 
Grove and seeing if we can make it 

some profit,” he said.
Lakhani added that the recent 

controversy surrounding RIMAC 
Annex illustrates a need for clearer 
standards regarding the allocation of 
student fee funds.

“I think that the main thing we 
have to do is make sure that com-
mittee members are well-trained and 
know how to deal with the admin-
istration and know what’s a fair use 
of student fees and what isn’t,” he 
said. “It’s not fair for the adminis-
tration to construct RIMAC Annex 
with money that was designated for 
recreational purposes.”

SV! candidate Chris Westling, 
who claimed one of the eight all-
campus senator positions, is an active 
member of UCSD’s environmental 
sustainability and social justice orga-
nization One Earth One Justice. He 
said his principal objective in office 
will be to make fair trade coffee, tea 
and sugar available at all campus 

restaurants. 
“UCSD needs to be a leader in 

social justice,” he said, adding that 
he has confidence in this year’s SV! 
coalition to achieve this status for 
the university. “If we can have a 
movement that has some solidarity, 
we really have the power to affect 
change.”

Commenting on Ritcherson’s 
unexpected victory, Bean said she 
had sent correspondences to elec-
tions officials, and she also told the 
Guardian that Ritcherson had bowed 
out of the race at the end of last 
month, when the presidential can-
didate was scheduling interviews for 
her slate’s contenders.

Ritcherson attended Friday’s 
announcements to support his SV! 
cohorts, and he said after his win that 
he was stunned but still undecided 
about his next move. Ritcherson, who

Coalition to Protest Education Cuts
By Deepak Seeni
Staff Writer

The Students for California’s 
Future Coalition, an organization 
comprised of students representing the 
University of California system, the 
California State University system and 
the California Community College 
system, has arranged several protests 
set for April 21 with the intent of 
publicly standing against Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s proposed $5-billion 
budget cuts to education next year. 

So far, coalition leaders have 
planned for protests to take place 

throughout the state, ranging from 
Sacramento to San Diego, in order to 
stress their belief that higher education 
in California is a significant priority 
that cannot be compromised.

Louise Hendrickson, president of 
the UC Students Association and a 
graduate student at UC Riverside, is 
currently working with the coalition.

Hendrickson said that fee increas-
es for students will be one of the 
significant results of budget cuts in 
the UC system, primarily because 
students will be forced to compensate 
for lost revenue through hikes in 
student fees.

“Cuts to the UC budget will be 
especially compensated by students 
through increases in student fees, up to 
30 percent,” Hendrickson said. “It has 
been confirmed that 10-percent cuts 
to higher-education systems across the 
board will result in a $300-million 
loss per system. For the UC system in 
particular, this loss will be compen-
sated by 10- to 30-percent increases in 
student fees.” 

Hendrickson also said reprioritiz-
ing education within the state budget 
is necessary and that Schwarzenegger

As part of an ongoing effort to place 
UCSD among the country’s top tier of 
environmentally friendly universities, 
campus officials revealed plans ear-
lier this month to undertake a new 
environmental-sustainability initiative 
partly designed to promote the imple-
mentation of renewable energy sources 
throughout the school.

Heavily influenced by the glob-

al climate research conducted at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
one of the initiative’s primary goals is 
to eventually allow UCSD to generate 
10 to 15 percent of its annual electricity 
needs from renewable power sources. 

In order to achieve this objective, 
a number of rooftop solar panels and 
waste-powered hydrogen fuel cells will 
be installed throughout campus over 
the next several years. Additionally,

L.A. Researchers Work to 
Secure Mideast Treasures

The research conducted by a pair 
of Los Angeles archaeologists may 
lead to developments in an unlikely 
aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict.

Ray Boytner, director of inter-
national research at the Cotsen 
Institute of Archaeology at UCLA, 
and Lynn Swartz Dodd, a lecturer in 
religious studies and curator of the 
University of Southern California’s 
Archaeological Research Collection, 
have for the past five years worked 
with Palestinian and Israeli research-
ers to establish a coherent agreement 
on the disposition of the region’s 
archeological possessions. 

“Israelis and Palestinians never 
previously had sat down to achieve 
a structured, balanced agreement to 
govern the region’s archaeological 
heritage,” Dodd said. “Our group 
got together with the vision of a 
future when people wouldn’t be at 
each other’s throats and archaeology 
would need to be protected, irre-
spective of which side of the border 
it falls on.”

Dodd said that the process of 
separating archaeological treasures 
between the two regions was a dif-
ficult undertaking.

“We’re talking about putting your 
precious archaeological heritage 
— things you believe your ancestors 
created — in the hands of what you 
now consider to be your enemy,” 
Dodd said. “We’re asking enemies to 
become partners.”

Boytner added, however, that 
the project’s achievements would 
potentially ease tensions over the 
establishment of an autonomous 
Palestinian state.

“According to international law, if 
there is a future Palestinian state, the 
Israelis will have to return all archae-
ological artifacts to the Palestinian 
state,” Boytner said. “That, for the 
[Israeli] right wing, would be a major 
rallying point to oppose the peace 
process. Therefore, archaeology 
could be a deal-breaker in future 
peace negotiations. But if we can 
deal with archaeology, we can help 
create a stable peace process that 
will be respected by both sides for 
years to come.”

North County Food Bank 
Expands to Meet Demand

The North County Community 
Services food bank announced last 
week that it had expanded its freezer 
capacity by over 30 percent in order 
to accommodate growing demands 
from the San Diego community. 

NCCS Director of Community 
Relations Tim Ney said that the 
expansion was needed to sustain 
continuing food-bank services on an 
appropriate scale.

“As the only food bank in Northern 
San Diego County, we are effectively 
streamlining our system to serve 
a larger population,” Ney said in a 
statement. “Over the past two years, 
food distribution has been increased 
by a palpable 33 percent during 
2005-06 and 32 percent for the year 
ended June 30, 2007.”

Ney also cited a recent UCLA 
study which revealed that a large 
percentage of San Diego households 
are often unable to afford enough 
food. The North County food bank 
distributed over 702,000 pounds of 
food during 2006-2007. Nearly all of 
the distributed food was donated by 
locally organized food drives.

UCSD this month became the 
only Southern California univer-
sity to join the Google Book Search 
project, an effort to digitally scan 
every book in the world.   

According to Brian Schottlaender, 
UCSD’s Audrey Geisel University 
Librarian, the campus expects to 
contribute tens of thousands of 
volumes from its East Asia and 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies collections. However, this 
estimate may change over the next 
few months as the total number of 
books to be digitalized has not yet 
been settled upon. 

Google co-Founders Sergey 
Brin and Larry Page got the idea 
for the project during their days 
as graduate students researching 
for the Stanford Digital Library 
Technologies Project.  Their goal 
was to create digital libraries in 
which books could be searched and 
sorted according to their relevance 
to the subject. 

Twelve years later, they are work-
ing on their own, grander digitiza-
tion scheme that includes UCSD. 

“UCSD has been a leader in digi-
tal initiatives for many years now,” 
Schottlaender said in an e-mail. “To 
be the only Southern California uni-

versity participating in the Google 
Books project reflects that leader-
ship and the strength of our Pacific 
Rim collections. In addition, this 
project will both help expand public 
access to our collections and help 
the libraries to digitally preserve 
thousands of books and other schol-
arly materials.”

Once the books are scanned, 
they will be made available in digital 
form to UCSD students.

According to Schottlaender, the 
digital books are more space-effi-
cient and much more accessible.  

Through the Internet, readers can 
access them in only a few seconds. 
In addition, digitization provides 
one of the only means to access old 
books that may have become too 
fragile for physical use. 

While Schottlaender said that 
digitizing books offers many advan-
tages, he added that the process also 
poses some technical challenges.

“On the minus side, digital for-
mats can become obsolete in a mat-
ter of a few years so upgrades are 
required regularly,” Schottlaender 
said. “Digitization also requires an 

ongoing financial commitment in 
order to be sustainable.”

Page started the Google Search 
Project with the simple question: 
How long would it take to digi-
tally scan every book in the world? 
He conducted an experiment in his 
office by systematically turning 300 
pages of a book and using a metro-
nome to keep time. In total, it took 
40 minutes to finish. 

From there, he went to the 
University of Michigan’s library, 
where he learned that the current 
estimate for scanning its seven mil-
lion volumes is 1,000 years. Page 
told the university president that he 
thought Google could cut it down 
to six years. 

Since then, Google has been 
actively researching methods to 
quickly and carefully scan books. 
They believe they have hit upon a 
method that is much gentler than 
the modern high-speed processes.  

A team of software engineers is 
also hard at work developing tech-
niques to process the tricky typefac-
es and symbols found in older books 
and over 430 different languages.

In total, over 16 publish-
ers have partnered with Google, 
including Cambridge University 
Press, Houghton Mifflin, Oxford 
University Press, Pearson, Penguin 
and Warner Books. The universities 
donating books include Harvard, 
the University of Michigan, the 
New York Public Library, Oxford, 
Stanford and UC Santa Cruz, for a 
total of more than 15 million vol-
umes.

campus officials are currently engaged 
in discussions with Wind Generator, a 
company that produces wind energy, 
with the intent of harnessing a signifi-
cant amount of electrical power from 
Southern California wind farms.

When all phases of the plan are 
complete, approximately seven mega-
watts of electricity needed to power 
the campus — an amount capable of 
powering roughly 6,000 homes — will 
be generated by renewable sources. 
These developments will allow UCSD 
to greatly scale back the use of natural 
gas as a source of energy.

Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary C. 
Matthews said that these environmen-
tal efforts are partly driven by the obli-
gation that UCSD has to developing 
such endeavors on a larger scale. 

“We believe as a university we have 
a moral imperative to act as role mod-

els and proactive stewards of the envi-
ronment,” Matthews said in an e-mail. 
“We also know that what we do locally 
has an impact on the region, nation 
and world.”

Matthews added that he hoped the 
action taken at UCSD might provide 
an example for other universities to 
follow.

“We will strive to be the leader 
in the nation and encourage others 
to do what they can on their cam-
pus,” Matthews said. “We are taking the 
seeds of discovery from our research, 
and we are planting them in our own 
backyard to reap the benefits.”

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who 
addressed the initiative at an April 3 
press conference, said that these envi-
ronmental endeavors are an achieve-
ment attained through the combined 
efforts of a number of separate groups 
at UCSD. 

“What makes UCSD truly unique 

are the collaborations that exist 
between our researchers, our faculty, 
our staff and our students,” Fox said. 
“Indeed, as we think about environ-
mental sustainability we are impressed 
that these groups are increasingly 
working together across disciplines 
and across job descriptions. They are 
seeking to come up with innovative 
solutions to our pressing environmen-
tal challenges.”

Fox said that UCSD’s environ-
mentally conscious actions will have 
important effects beyond the campus.

“Our research, our education, our 
green practices and our student involve-
ment have local impact, national influ-
ence and global reach,” Fox said. 

Campus officials hope to have the 
first solar panels installed by early 
2009.

fails to understand the importance 
of higher education to the state’s 
growth.

“The main point of this coalition 
is to emphasize the importance of 
higher education, so we are com-
ing together to protest the actions 
of the governor,” Hendrickson said. 
“Students in higher education have 
the biggest stake in this issue because 
they are going to have to bear the 
brunt of these cuts through fee 
increases.” 

According to Hendrickson, state 
budget cuts in education this year 
are planned to exceed $5 billion and 
will have widespread effects ranging 
from K-12 to the UC, CSU and CCC 
systems. 

The coalition reports that K-12 
schools will experience greater class-

room sizes and fewer teachers, as well 
as diminished arts, sports and music 
programs, many of which are already 
underfunded. Schools will also 
experience cuts to their before- and 
after-school programs, child-nutri-
tion programs and special-education 
programs.

Additionally, the coalition reports 
that over 50,000 potential commu-
nity-college students will be turned 
away by the CCC system due to their 
inability to pay steeper tuition. The 
coalition also stated that the CSU 
system will be forced to turn away 
as many as 10,000 potential students 
due to lack of accommodations, and 
that UC students will experience 10- 
to 30-percent fee hikes as increases in 
fees are assumed to be the only plau-
sible manner by which to compensate 
for budget cuts.

“In terms of the state budget, we 
need to reprioritize education as 
something more important and essen-
tial,” Hendrickson said. “We need to 
find alternate sources of revenue and 
funding for these institutions. Budget 
cuts that fall on the backs of students 
through fee increases are not an opti-
mal solution.”

Hendrickson added that students  
will play a crucial role in the coali-
tion’s action, planned for later this 
month. 

“Every student we can get counts,” 
Hendrickson said. “I encourage as 
many students as possible to show up 
because they have the greatest stake 
in this issue. It should be a priority 
among students.”

race. She did not mention any specific 
plans to address the confusion, but 
she said a thorough investigation of 
the circumstanc-
es is in order.

“I think [the 
results] may have 
to be re-evalu-
ated,” she said.

A.S. Elections 
Manager Tanya 
Piyaratanaphipat 
said she never 
received any 
communication about the dropout 
from SV! officials or Ritcherson him-
self, and that she would have removed 
him from the ballot if she had been 
informed of his decision.

“There was absolutely no incentive 
for me to not take him off the ballot,” 
she said, explaining that she respond-
ed immediately to all five declara-
tions to withdraw that she received 
last week. She added that Ritcherson 
reserves the option to resign from his 
position if he chooses, in which case 
Bean, with the consent of the coun-
cil, will be responsible to appoint a 
replacement.

Sarma said that even if he lacks 
official affiliation with SV! next year, 
his goals will not change.

“I’ll still be working on the same 

principles of student representation 
and campus connectivity that I’ve 
always advocated,” he said. “I hope 
to still use my experience and con-
tacts from Student Voice! next year to 
establish those principles.”

Last week’s ballot also included 
a survey that gauged student input 
regarding a potential Activity Fee 
Referendum. Voters ranked the Sun 
God Festival and student organiza-
tions as their top funding priorities, 
but over half of responders said they 
do not support increasing student 
activity fees to support these causes.

In the survey’s second compo-
nent, regarding 
the residential 
security officer 
program, 34 per-
cent of respond-
ers said they feel 
safer knowing 
that RSOs patrol 
student resi-
dences, and 70 
percent said they 

would be willing to complete a more 
detailed student satisfaction form.

Overall, voter turnout amounted 
to 9.1 percent of the student popula-
tion. Compared to last year’s 4,295 
votes in the four-way A.S. presiden-
tial race, only 1,956 students partici-
pated in this year’s entire election.

Piyaratanaphipat said candidates’ 
campaigns generally drive voter par-
ticipation, but that with very few 
contested races this year, the tremen-
dous responsibility of encouraging 
turnout fell upon her eight-member 
election committee.

“Hopefully this year was an 
anomaly,” she said.

Newsom, is a celebrity in his own 
right and local San Franciscans have 
placed the man on such a high pedestal 
that nothing he does can fully tarnish 
his idolized image. Aside from having 
admitted to sleeping with his campaign 
manager’s wife, Newsom checked into 
rehab for alcohol abuse after showing 
up at numerous political events obvi-
ously wasted. These are the types of 
things that would get most politicians 
ousted from their political throne, but 
not for Newsom, who is as beloved by 
the majority of the city as are cable cars 
and Haight Street. 

When Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) 
was found guilty of “lewd conduct” 
in an airport bathroom, the pundits 
at CNN had a field day. What bet-
ter distraction from the real faults 
of American politicians than a U.S. 
senator having homosexual sex in a 

Have you seen the pictures of Halle Berry’s baby? Yeah, but that’s nothing, did you hear 
what Britney Spears just did? No way 
did she do that, but can you believe 
how much former New York Gov. Eliot 
Spitzer paid for his prostitute?

American society has an obsession 
with fame and fortune, popular culture 
and everything to do with celebrities. 
It makes me mad enough that the 
average American knows more about 
which pop star just checked into rehab 
than the rising death toll in Iraq, but it 
seems that recently, our fixation with 
celebrities has transcended the world 
of politics. On the off chance that I 
stop on Fox News on my way to watch 
ESPN or Food Network, it seems that 
news anchors have nothing better to 
talk about than which local politician 
had an affair and lied about it.

Don’t get me wrong, I think it is 
awful that elected officials, and people 
in general, are cheating on their spous-
es and lying about it, but considering 
the state of the world, why is so much 
attention being paid to political sex 
scandals? Apparently, the genocide in 
Sudan is meaningless when new evi-
dence has surfaced implicating Detroit 
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick in an extra-
marital affair with his chief of staff.

To me, there seems to be a direct 
correlation between the tabloid-mind-
ed nature of the American public and 
the way in which politicians are ana-
lyzed. Nobody cares that Detroit has 
one of the highest unemployment rates 
in the nation or that its factories are 
closing down with alarming frequency 
— all that matters is that its mayor slept 
with a woman who is not his wife. 

San Francisco’s own mayor, Gavin 

bathroom stall at the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul International Airport? Forget an 
American national debt of $9.5 trillion; 
what matters is that an elected official 
got it on with a dude in a bathroom.

Aside from the numerous domestic 
problems that face the United States, 
the glorification of American politi-
cians keeps us from paying attention 
to the global atrocities going on around 
us. War, starvation, genocide, racism 
and sickness abound, yet Rep. Richard 
Curtis (R-Wash.) getting blackmailed 
by a male prostitute dominated the 
national headlines. 

Isn’t the point of our American 
democracy that all citizens are equal, 
and that our politicians are normal folk 
just like us who are elected to represent 
the average citizen? If that’s true, then 
how is it that politicians have become 
glorified to the point where their pri-

vate lives are now more important 
than their political decisions? Treating 
elected officials as celebrities detracts 
from what their true responsibility is 
and creates a superficial public image.

An informed American public 
should keep politicians honest and on 
task, but that will never happen if they 
are treated like movie stars and musi-
cians. Guaranteeing that they fulfill their 
role in government requires us to view 
them in the same light as everyone else, 
regardless of what they did to whom in 
an airport bathroom.

WHAT DOES THIS BUILDING MEAN FOR STUDENT POWER?

New Building a Site of Both Student Needs and Wants

Process of Bringing About Annex Left 
Students’ Opinions by the Wayside

The recent groundbreaking of the RIMAC Annex project has been the subject of much dis-
cussion in this paper and in recent A.S. 
Council meetings. But it seems that 
this is just the product of a few cur-
rent councilmembers whose narrow-
minded vision of the university has 
darkened this new facility’s prospects.

I have served as the student co-
chair of the Athletics, Recreation and 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board for 
the past three years. ARSFAB was 
created in 2004 through a partner-
ship between the A.S. Council, the 
Graduate Student Association and the 
vice chancellor of student affairs to 
address policy and budgetary matters 
of these departments, including capital 
improvements. During this time, we 
have spoken on many occasions about 
the RIMAC Annex, both about fund-
ing and the general layout of the facil-
ity. Our student members take their 
roles seriously and participate fully in 
these discussions.

First, some facts: RIMAC — the 
Recreation, Intramurals and Athletics 

Complex — was designed between 
1988 and 1991 to replace Main Gym, 
which is maintained completely by the 
university and does not use student 
funds. RIMAC was conceived as a hub 
for both recreation and intercollegiate 
athletics. It was designed to hold an 
arena, weight rooms, high- and low-
impact activity rooms and racquetball, 
squash and basketball courts. All of 
these things can be found in the cur-
rent structure, which is nearing its 
15th anniversary. The original plans 
called for additional conference-room 
space — far more than is currently 
available, and various food service and 
dining facilities. The latter two, along 
with proposals for hot tubs and sau-
nas, a rock-climbing center and an 
outdoor resource center, were left out 
of the original building due to budget-
ary concerns.

In various student surveys sub-
mitted since the opening of RIMAC, 
including a 1997 Quality of Student 
Life Survey and last winter’s survey 
during the special election, students 
have overwhelmingly supported the 

idea of expanding the lounge and 
meeting-room spaces. Today, demand 
for meeting room space remains high. 
Additionally, students continually sup-
ported expanded activity-room space.

So, I find myself perplexed as to 
what the problem with the RIMAC 
Annex is. Is it because a very small 
minority — including one member 
who is no longer on the board — has 
suddenly taken the cause to the stu-
dent government because ARSFAB 
continually ruled against him by a 
large consensus? Is it a student gov-
ernment that has taken new meaning 
to the expression of having a bark 
bigger than its bite? Or is it that the 
opposition simply doesn’t like the idea 
of something athletics-related — not 
intercollegiate athletics — because in 
its mind, the athletics program has 
already gotten its fair share.

As a veteran of campus politics, 
I think this situation oozes with the 
marks of all three of these possibilities. 
Even as the opposition tried to drum

It’s almost uncomfortable to watch proponents of the RIMAC Annex contort themselves into 
pretzels as they struggle to justify the 
project, an unenviable task consider-
ing the problems they have to sur-
mount. The project involves spend-
ing millions of students’ recreation-
fee dollars on retail outlets instead 
of facilities for exercise and sports. It 
was conceived, planned and under-
taken by a handful of administrators 
long before students were involved. 
And finally, when the project came 
to students’ attention and they said 
they wanted more cardio machines 
and weight rooms instead of a conve-
nience store and a cafe, students were 
frustrated in their efforts to effect 
any such changes. None of this looks 
very good.

Misgivings about the annex proj-
ect are not mine alone — and they are 
not new. Every A.S. president since 
Jenn Pae in 2004 has shared simi-
lar concerns, as has every president 
of the Graduate Student Association 
since Kris Kohler the same year. I 
have worked with all eight of these 
student leaders trying to convey the 
common-sense notion that students’ 
recreation-facility fees are for recre-
ation facilities.

Usually, major construction fund-
ed by student fees requires a referen-
dum, but because RIMAC fees gener-
ate a large surplus, administrators can 
afford a whole new building without 
asking students. Almost $5 million 
in accumulated RIMAC reserves are 
earmarked for the annex, and the rest 
will be borrowed against future fees. 
When student fees exceed the needs 
for which they’re collected, students 
should be involved in an open pro-
cess to determine how to spend the 
money or, alternatively, whether to 
decrease the fee.

The RIMAC fee was established by 
a 1990 referendum that stated “deci-
sions regarding funding of [RIMAC] 
must be discussed / reviewed with 

the Registration Fee Committee,” but 
by the time the committee was con-
sulted the RIMAC Annex project 
was nearly three years underway and 
had already drawn on RIMAC fees 
for its planning and design. The cafe 
had been part of the plan since 2002, 
but administrators didn’t discuss this 
decision with the Registration Fee 
Committee until February 2005.

In their first meeting concerning 
the RIMAC Annex, students on the 
Registration Fee Committee asked 
commonsense questions: When there 
is “a wait list for the aerobics machines 
[...] how come we’re not buying more 
exercise machines, and how come 
we’re building a cafe?” They told 
the sports-facilities director that “the 
main concern with RIMAC is the 
need for additional exercise equip-
ment.” Another student said, “there’s 
a distinction between something that 
you want to be built at some point 
and something that you want to be 
built with funds that are set aside for 
recreational purposes.” Committee 
members commented that it seemed 
not so much an annex to RIMAC as 
“an extension of the Price Center.”

The Registration Fee Committee 
wrote to the vice chancellor of stu-
dent affairs expressing concern that 
students weren’t involved in the plan-
ning, that the project wouldn’t serve 
any athletic purpose and that it didn’t 
address student demand for exercise 
space and equipment. But students’ 
thoughtful input, three years into the 
project, had little impact on adminis-
trators’ course of action.

The Registration Fee Committee 
also pushed for the creation of a 
student board to oversee the RIMAC 
fee and facility. As I’d discussed with 
presidents Pae and Kohler, since 
RIMAC was built using student 
fees, UCSD policies required that 
the campus establish a student-led 
board with jurisdiction including

MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

up support from other ARSFAB mem-
bers at the past council meeting, his 
arguments were refuted by one of our 
GSA members, who could not recol-
lect any controversy surrounding the 
RIMAC Annex since his appointment 
in winter 2007.

As chair of these meetings, I was 
not surprised when our argument of 
student satisfaction with the proposed 
project was substantiated; it was strike 
one against the opposition’s argument.

Strike two came during the most 
recent A.S. Council meeting. In the 
meeting, it was consistently argued that 
student input was not welcomed — it 
has been argued several times in print 
also. Yet, a year ago, Sports Facilities 
Director Don Chadwick addressed 
the council about the RIMAC Annex. 
Based on the entire project portfolio , 
he explained that no new fees would 
be assessed. Additionally, he made a 
special note to say that no new debt 
service would be incurred. Combined 
with the aforementioned surveys and 
focus groups, as well as ARSFAB and 
the student-run Building Advisory 
Committee, input was both welcomed 
and received.

Convoluted questions asked during 
the meeting were meant to verbally 
crucify Chadwick as a callous admin-
istrator with no stomach for student 
input. Questions from President Marco 
Murillo, Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Long Pham and 
President-elect Donna Bean focused 
on the annex-related semantics. In 
their minds, recreation is limited to 
sports-related activities. This is not sur-
prising, coming from a council that has 
seen its biggest debates center around 
Triton Tide and screen printing. 

However, their arguments were 
negated by one of their very own. In a 
response to a question by Pham about 
what was considered recreation, I told 
the council that the UCSD Recreation 
Department offers a class on how 
to play poker. I figured certainly we 

could agree that poker is not consid-
ered a sport in the traditional sense. 
But a vocal Vice President of External 
Relations Dorothy Young reminded 
me that poker exercises the mind (not 
to mention that poker appeared on 
ESPN — a station that also airs the 
Scripps National Spelling Bee). So if 
the council’s definition of recreation 
is anything that exercises mind, body 
or soul, certainly they should not have 
any problems with the amenities in 
the annex.

Let’s see. The annex’s convenience 
store will stock protein drinks and 
bars, organic fruits and juices and vari-
ous other health-related products. I 

think we can agree that this would 
benefit the body, especially after utiliz-
ing RIMAC’s facilities. The cafe will 
feature a health-food theme, while at 
the same time is open to having access 
to beer and wine service — and cer-
tainly after a hard day at work a drink 
is not totally unwarranted for the mind 
and soul to unwind. Better yet, a daily 
glass of red wine has been shown to 
lower the risk for heart disease. 

And finally, the lounge space and 
conference room, which are equipped 
with wireless Internet, provide stu-
dents, teams and student organizations 
areas to do their work and conduct 
their meetings. I think we can safely 
assume that these areas also point to 
a desire to allow for the exercising of 
one’s mind.

I think that these are pretty straight-

forward answers to the mental blocks 
that the four or five people asking 
questions had. But to my astonish-
ment, questioning continued for two 
hours and became rather repetitive, 
with every question having a hint of 
trying to trap Chadwick into saying 
anything that the inquirer could con-
strue as disregarding student opinion.

The main concern that most stu-
dents have with RIMAC is the lack 
of adequate workout equipment 
and activity-room space. This was a 
point argued ad nauseam by the A.S. 
Council, in regard to the annex not 
containing any of these features. First, 
this statement is a misnomer, as the 
annex does provide for a conference/
team room, which will be used for 
low-impact recreational classes such as 
yoga and massage. Secondly, ARSFAB 
is planning additional activity, weight 
and cardio space spaces in existing 
facilities. 

In RIMAC, an additional 32 piec-
es of cardiovascular equipment — to 
be added by next fall — will be put 
where the racquetball seating currently 
exists. Additionally, there are plans to 
build an activity room and expand 
the weight room at Spanos Athletic 
Training Facility in order to serve as a 
varsity athlete training area, thus free-
ing up the pit for general use. 

And in the near future there will 
be renovations at the Main Gym to 
accommodate more weight and activ-
ity-room spaces. Combine these 
advancements with the newly opened 
Wellness Studio and all of the con-
cerns of the small minority on the A.S. 
Council will be addressed even before 
the annex is set to open its doors. I 
believe this is strike three.

And as ARSFAB chair, I can’t see 
how going through these processes 
on a student-dominated board would 
be anything less than student input. I 
would stand by the student voice on 
this aspect for as long as the building 
will allow current and future students 
to enjoy its amenities.

capital improvements. So this com-
bined effort, growing partly out of 
the RIMAC Annex issue, led to the 
creation of the Athletics, Recreation 
and Sports Facility Advisory Board 
in 2005. I declined requests to run 
for student co-chair; instead, I invited 
Daniel Palay to the next meeting and 
nominated him for the position, since 
I knew him as an outspoken A.S. 
senator and a student athlete.

But ARSFAB 
as a board never 
did examine the 
RIMAC Annex 
as I and the other 
advocates for 
its creation had 
intended it to do. 
We did little but 
listen to lengthy 
area updates from 
the three respective 
directors of sports 
facilities, athlet-
ics and recreation 
programs. I took 
every opportunity 
to relay concerns 
about the RIMAC Annex and suggest 
it contain exercise equipment, but the 
administrators on the board respond-
ed in a mostly dismissive manner and 
told us we wouldn’t make decisions 
about the project since a building 
advisory committee for the annex 
had been formed more than a year 
before ARSFAB.

In Jan. 2007, I worked with the 
A.S. and GSA presidents to write a 
survey for students to answer through 
TritonLink specifying what they want-
ed in the RIMAC Annex. Over 7,500 
students responded and, not surpris-
ingly, voted for activity rooms, weight 
rooms and cardio equipment over a 
convenience store or cafe. At the Feb. 
27 ARSFAB meeting we presented 

Annex Another Example of  
Student Disempowerment

▶ DAHLSTROM, from page 4 the results clearly ordered by priority, 
but this led to the same place as most 
other board discussions: nowhere.

Administrators should have based 
the project details on student input, 
but instead they made all the impor-
tant decisions without meaningful stu-
dent participation. They did eventu-
ally delegate to ARSFAB one decision 
about the RIMAC Annex: whether 
or not alcoholic beverages would be 
sold there. This led one board mem-

ber to remark 
that ARSFAB’s 
role was more to 
“choose the color 
of lipstick than 
the pig.”

The RIMAC 
Annex project 
has been a glar-
ing example of 
student disem-
powerment, but 
it isn’t beyond 
hope. Retail in

may be needed, 
but a cafe and

A t 9 a.m. on April 12, a group of about 30 local high school seniors and some of their hosts — UCSD 
students who housed the potential fresh-
men in their dorm rooms the night before 
— stood in a circle in Mandeville Center’s 
East room. 

Sixth College senior Kevin Mann and 
Thurgood Marshall College senior Junie 
Chea led the circle in a meditative activ-
ity.

“Close your eyes,” Mann said. “Think 
about the feeling of entering a different 
stage in life and becoming whoever you 
want to become.” 

After a few last words, the UCSD High 
School Overnight Program was over, and 
the high school seniors were ushered off 
to enjoy the rest of Admit Day. The hosts’ 
duties, which included accompanying 
their students all day Friday and open-
ing up their dorm rooms at night, were 
complete. 

UCSD’s HSO program is a one-day, 
one-night event that pairs a UCSD admit 
with a current student to give the potential 
freshmen a tangible idea of what life at 
UCSD is like. 

“It was [many students’] first time at 
UCSD, and some had never even been 
to a college campus before,” Mann said. 
“[Visiting] sometimes can seem really 
impersonal and we really wanted to give 
the students a really personal experience 
in a one-to-one mentorship fashion.” 

As student co-coordinators for HSO, 
Mann and Chea have both been part of 
other student initiatives that have held 
various overnight programs over the past 
few years. But this year the program has 
been given higher priority in an effort 
to increase the diversity and yield of 
accepted applicants who actually end up 
attending UCSD. 

Admissions officer Jaime Velasco said 
that this year’s HSO program collaborated 
with Student-Initiated Access Programs 
and Services and the Admissions Office, 
after Chancellor Marye Anne Fox released 
a report in 2007 highlighting UCSD as one 
of the least diverse campuses of the UC 
system. The March 2007 report, released 
by the Advisory Committee on Increasing 
Yield of Underrepresented Students, said 
that of the nine UC campuses, UCSD 
ranked ninth for percentage of black stu-
dents and eighth for percentage of Latino 
students, and has less than 1 percent 
American Indian students. 

The HSO program targets underserved 
high schools, specifically from the bot-
tom 20 percent, that are lacking college 
resources, Advanced Placement classes 
and “a-g” college preparatory classes in 
addition to having low college attendance 
rates. 

Velasco hopes to see the program grow 
and reach the level of quality it had in the 
late 1990s, before the 2002-03 budget cuts 
crippled its scope. This year, the program 

encompassed only San Diego 
and Imperial County while, 
in the past, the program was 
able to reach Los Angeles 
and even the Bay Area. 

“This year was kind of 
a ‘Let’s get started again,’” 
Velasco said. “My hope is 

that it is expanded through-
out the state. It would be nice 
to get literally 300 or 400 
students at an overnight 
here.” 
However, in terms of 

increasing yield, expanding the pro-
gram is only part of the process. The stu-
dent coordinators attribute this to the lack 
of knowledge that students from under-
served high schools have about campus 
resources. 

“We have heard comments from high 
school students that the reason they don’t 
choose UCSD is because they don’t see 
themselves here,” Mann said in a state-
ment. “They don’t see their peers here. 

They don’t see people from their own 
communities here. They don’t see the sup-
port networks that they can have when 
they come to UCSD.”

To combat this, hosts are encouraged 
to introduce their students to the vari-
ous resources on campus, bring them to 
classes, eat at dining halls together and 
immerse them in dorm life. All of these 
experiences combined, plus a host’s hos-
pitality, are what coordinators hope will

Lessons From a Dynamic Lifetime
Political science professor John Stoessinger uses his rich international experiences to give students a broader education.

By Candice Wu
Senior Staff Writer

Dr. John Stoessinger is known to interject some comic relief during class while transition-
ing between world crises. 

“A 96-year-old divorces his attrac-
tive, blonde 24-year-old wife to marry 
a nice, average-looking 68-year-old,” 
Stoessinger said with a slight grin, 
during a February lecture about revo-
lution in China. “Why did he do 
this? Because the older woman has 
patience!”

There were no laughs, and 
Stoessinger stood in the center of 
class, bewildered by the silent response 
before finally speaking up with flailing 
palms. “Does no one find this funny 
…  at all? Well, it’s funny to me for 
obvious reasons!” 

Only then does the class erupt in 
laughter — partly because most of 
Stoessinger’s jokes are self-deprecat-
ing and partly because, even in a joke, 
he teaches his students a lesson of 
patience that can be applied to history 
and politics. 

Stoessinger’s understanding of 
international and private relations 
derives from numerous encounters 
with historical figures and situa-

tions; his historic life began when he 
encountered Adolf Hitler and expands 
through his time spent with former 
President John F. Kennedy during the 
Cuban Missile Crisis, to the current 
war in Iraq. 

His continuous involvement in 
world crises has fueled him to teach 
for the last five decades, but his stu-
dents best remember him as the pro-
fessor with sharp, effortless humor 
and a signature outfit; regardless of 
the season, Stoessinger wears a solid-
colored sweater with his shirt collar 
meticulously affixed above its crew-
neck, finished with standard-washed 
blue jeans and black or white sneak-
ers.

“I may look harmless, but I’ll grill 
your [history] knowledge,” Stoessinger 
said.

After teaching at prestigious col-
leges such as Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, Princeton University, 
Harvard University and Columbia 
University, Stoessinger now lectures 
at UCSD and the University of San 
Diego. His silver-white hair may hint 
at his age and substantial knowledge 
of history, but his ear-to-ear grin after 
telling a joke eliminates any idea that 
he suffered through the Holocaust or 
watched helplessly as innocent men 

and boys — including students of 
his — perished in the Vietnam War. 
His career was shaped by the world 
crises in which he involuntarily or 
consciously became involved, and his 
lectures give students a glimpse into 
important internatioal issues.  

Stoessinger has no office at either 
UCSD or USD. The UCSD politi-
cal-science department can offer only 
ambiguous answers on how to reach 
him beyond class hours; since he posts 
no e-mail address next to his name on 
the faculty directory, his availability 
has become a hot commodity that stu-
dents eagerly seek. 

“He’s different [from other profes-
sors] because you become more inter-
ested in his life and his experiences as 
opposed to the actual course material,” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior and 
past student Elska Vuong said. “World 
crises that seem so remote from your 
real life become more dimensional 
because [his] personal stories take 
incredible events off the page and 
[make them] more real and relatable.”

On March 13, 1938, seven-year-
old Stoessinger knew his life would be 
changed forever when his governess, 
Lisl, took him to see Hitler speak in

MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

There’s an old telephoto lens that has been passed down from generation to genera-tion within the Guardian family. Inside its 
beaten and scratched body held together with tape, 
the optics are still pristine. Never mind that for a 
10-pound hunk of metal and glass, the lens rattles 
like a baby toy. Many shooters have eyed its narrow 
field of view, an unwieldy 
300 mm tunnel fashioned 
in an age before image sta-
bilization. The magnified 
world trembles with every 
heartbeat, so trying to keep 
fast-moving athletes in 
frame is often particularly 
frustrating. What matters, 
though, is that it’s a profes-
sional piece of equipment. So by some wishful logic, 
whoever uses it could be considered a professional 
photographer and will surely be recognized as such 
every time he or she straps it on to their camera.

Among photographers there is a type of lens 
envy, best summarized by a caricature of the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer David Hume 
Kennerly drawn by his friend and fellow Pulitzer 
winner Jeffrey MacNelly. It shows Kennerly beam-
ing as all his camera equipment hangs around his 
neck — the prize of his collection an especially long 
lens that dangles at crotch level.

I recently had the opportunity to shoot with a 
photographer who is a true professional, regardless 
of the size of his lens. His name is Lenny Ignelzi, 
a member of the Associated Press who has been 
working in the field for over 30 years, and who 
let me tag along for a couple of San Diego Padres 
games during the team’s first stretch of home games 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers. One of the first 
questions he asked over the phone to size me up, of 
course, was, “How long is your longest lens?”

I proudly spouted off the specifications of the 
Guardian’s ancient lens, which, after a tense pause, 
garnered a positive reaction of “not bad” from the 
professional. We met before the first game in the 
San Diego Union-Tribune’s parking lot, where I rec-
ognized him as he had described himself over the 
phone: with gray hair and a limp. I guess decades 
of covering breaking news and sports will catch up 
with a person’s knees. Ignelzi had been nice enough 
to get me a media pass for the Padres games that 
weekend, but after some cursing and frantic search-
ing in his Prius, he couldn’t recover the actual pass. 

So in the interim he outfitted me with the creden-
tials of a bearded, middle-aged man named Jack.

After receiving directions to meet him at Petco 
Park, my excitement, as well as my lack of familiarity 
with downtown San Diego, caused more than one 
wrong turn as I drove to the stadium. By the time I 
was hustling past batboys and security guards in the 

tunnel leading to the field, I 
could hear the announce-
ment of the first pitch. To 
make matters worse, the 
tunnel split in two, one each 
for the first- and third-base 
sides. My cell phone wasn’t 
getting reception, and so as 
I imagined Ignelzi settling in 
to shoot the game, I figured 

my cause was almost lost. Luckily, I received a little 
kindness from the Japanese media swarming the 
park to cover the American debut of the veteran 
Japanese pitcher Hiroki Kuroda. In halting English, 
one man directed me toward third base. The tunnel 
opened up into a stadium full of roaring fans, and 
next to the dugout, the master was shooting the 
starting pitchers. He was amazed at my tardiness 
but luckily not too angry. After the first inning, I 
followed him through the lower seats to the media 
box on the first-base side.

This is where I spent the rest of the two games I 
shot — 50 feet to the side of the Padres dugout and 
only a little farther from first base. Looking through 
my camera, the view reminded me of the pictures I 
had seen so many times on the baseball cards I col-
lected as a (not-so-young) kid. It was exciting not 
only to watch my favorite sport so closely, but also 
to see that there wasn’t much difference between 
my shots of the older veterans like Jeff Kent and 
Jim Edmonds and those of the same players on the 
cards I had collected during my childhood.

At least, the resemblance was there when I 
could train my camera and keep it steady for even a 
fraction of a second. The glowing fantasy of shoot-
ing the big leagues soon faded back into the reality 
of long-lens photography. Shots of batters were easy 
enough, though my camera’s shutter ticked away 
painfully at half the rate of a truly professional one. 
I managed only a handful of other decent action 
shots the entire weekend — a stolen base here, a 
couple ground balls there. With a lot of difficulty 
I almost managed to catch a diving Andruw Jones 
as he came up with a fly ball, only to focus on 

the grass immediately in front of the all-star. 
Imagine closing one eye and looking through a 
cardboard paper towel tube, and then looking 
up and trying to find Orion’s belt in the night 
sky — in a fraction of a second — and you’ll 
understand my aggravation.

But the experience was one of my most 
memorable behind a camera. I stood in awe not 
just for the game, but also for the mastery with 
which Ignelzi wielded his equipment. His lens 
was longer than mine by a considerable margin, 
but he still whipped it around at one point fast 
enough to catch the shortstop in midair as he 
dove for a bullet line drive. I left with thousands 
of pictures to look through, remembering what 
the master said after shooting that diving play. 
The 30-year veteran had looked up from his 
camera’s LCD screen, laughing at how he had 
gotten the winning shot on the first frame of the 
burst. “There’s a lot of skill involved,” he said, 
“but a lot of it is just luck.” For my weekend as 
a so-called professional sports photographer I 
certainly felt lucky.

MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  11

his hometown of Vienna, Austria. 
Grasping her crucifix necklace, Lisl 
muttered, “Holy Maria, Mother of 
God — this is a new Messiah.” His 
entire childhood changed for the 
worse for four years with the Nazis 
at his family’s heels; they finally fled 
Europe by taking a train across the 
Soviet Union and reached Japan three 
months later.

Although Japan was not an ally of 
the United States, a Japanese diplomat 
named Manabe helped Stoessinger’s 
family obtain visas to seek refuge 
in Shanghai, China from the geno-
cide. This man taught Stoessinger the 
power of human kindness at a very 
young age. 

“You can’t spend your life general-
izing people into categories of good 
and evil,” Stoessinger said. “A Japanese 
man saved my life during [World War 
II] — that’s enough to prove that you 
cannot have a preconceived mentality 
about individual behavior.” 

After arriving in the United States 
in 1947 and receiving his Ph.D. from 
Harvard University, Stoessinger soon 
became involved with politics and 
would devote the rest of his life to pre-
venting events such as the Holocaust, 
from happening again.

“I’ve seen the world suffer through 
many experiences that could have been 
avoided,” Stoessinger said. “He who 
steps into a war in the 20th century will 
come out a loser — and I hope this is a 
message to a certain president who has 
us in a losing predicament.” 

In the early 1970s, Stoessinger 
worked with the secretary general as 
director of the political affairs division 
at the United Nations to draw peace 
negotiations between the United 
States and Vietnam; unfortunately, the 
two presidents lacked patience for his 
proposed conferences. Bilateral talks 
did not succeed, and the Vietnam 
War erupted despite Stoessinger’s 
efforts. Even today, his sudden halt in 
pacing and hushed voice when men-

tioning this war shows some remorse 
for what was lost during his eight 
years at the United Nations.

“In this situation with Vietnam, I 
failed at preventing war and unneces-
sary death,” he said. “But I think you 
learn more from failure than from 
success — so I learned from it, and it 
was a terrible experience [that] made 
me wiser and somewhat sadder.”

His lectures not only iterate histo-
ry lessons, but also incorporate bursts 
of song and mischievous adolescent 
thoughts; his infamous encounter 
with a Chinese prostitute — a par-
ticular story that highlights a lecture 
about his life during the Holocaust 
— stands out in students’ memories. 

Stoessinger’s vivid story of his teen-
age run-in with the Chinese escort 
— properly named “The Golden 
Dragon” for her 200-pound frame 
and 24 gold-capped teeth — never 
fails to shock the class. 

“What do you do when you’re 
15-years old in the middle of a war,” 
Stoessinger said. “And you’re a virgin 
who thinks he’s about to die?”

The lecture hall echoed with 
uncontrollable laughter as he revealed 
how his friends sent him to the broth-
el in his best suit and tie — and armed 
with a nail file “in case anything went 
wrong.” 

Nonetheless, Stoessinger assured 
his students that he remained a virgin 
that night after being kicked out of 
the brothel.

Students like Roosevelt College 
senior Mary Micevych constantly lose 
themselves in his tales.

“Professor Stoessinger is passion-
ate about what he teaches, which I 
find so rare in professors at UCSD,” 
Micevych said. “Many professors teach 
the materials and classes because they 
have to as a part of their university 
contract, [but] Stoessinger … even 
challenges students in their personal 
lives, not just to excel in his class.”

At the first lecture of each Crisis 
Areas in World Politics course, 

Stoessinger forces a handful of stu-
dents to stand up in front of a class 
full of strangers to share their stories 
of “the one who got away.” 

Each of these students must dis-
cuss a past situation in which they 
were too shy to ask for someone’s 
phone number; Stoessinger then asks 
them to seize an opportunity with a 
romantic interest before the class final 
and report back to him with their 
endeavors. The quarter-long embar-
rassment for these students stems 
from his take-home message about 
taking full advantage of any circum-
stance — whether it is trying to snag 
a date with someone, prevent the 
repetition of mistakes or contribute 
opinions to the class. 

Throughout the course, his per-
sonal and professional experiences 
convey the message for students to 
become involved in their environ-
ment using knowledge gained from 
various world crises.  

Despite his humorous anecdotes 
and stories of childhood misbehav-
ior, the entire class is based on his 
theory of a morality where leaders 
must realize that mistakes made 
throughout modern history should 
be taken as lessons learned — that 
war will cost millions of lives at 
the wager’s loss. Each crisis lec-
ture emanates this premise, and 
Stoessinger wants his students to 
reflect on history and apply it to 
their own lives.

“I hope somebody gets the mes-
sage sooner or later that it doesn’t 
matter if you’re a capitalist, com-
munist, rich, poor or whatever color 
you are — if you start a war, you will 
lose the war,” Stoessinger said. “But 
people still fight and haven’t gotten 
the message yet. I hope that in my 
small way, I can make a contribution 
that people will finally learn a lesson 
through history.”

him a lot to look forward to.
“This was my first time ever 

going to an actual class,” Zuniga 
said. “We got to see the whole cam-
pus; we saw everything.”

The program is also a posi-
tive experience for UCSD students 
volunteering as hosts. Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore 
Aldrich Acueza, Zuniga’s host, 
chose to get involved because he 
had previously participated in the 
program.

“I did the same exact program 
when I was a junior in high school 
and I had so much fun, and I would 
definitely say it affected my deci-
sion to go here,” Acueza said. 

Although many of the students 
became involved in the program 
because they wanted to give back 
to their community, Roosevelt 
College freshman and HSO co-
chair Olushade Unger chose to be 
a host because she never saw her 
own high school involved in an 
overnight program. 

“It shows that people care,” 
Unger said. 

Acueza admitted that one of the 
biggest hurdles is the student per-
ception that UCSD lacks a social 
atmosphere. 

“It can be really fun,” Acueza 

said. “I don’t want to say it’s not 
true, about UCSD having no social 
life, but I feel like you can totally 
change that; it’s what you make of 
UCSD.” 

According to the evaluations 
that HSO representatives collected 
at the program’s end, many pro-
spective students expected even 
less of the college experience than 
the common stereotypes, which 
Mann believes could easily be due 
to their insufficient exposure to any 
college campus. 

“[Students] thought it would be 
boring and all about school, and 
what they came away with was that 
they didn’t think college could be 
so fun, didn’t realize there could be 
more than academics,” Mann said. 

Despite the possible misconcep-
tions and current lack of diversity, 
UCSD students involved in HSO 
feel they are taking a step forward 
in helping their community and 
affecting actual change. 

“It’s an uplifting feeling to say 
we’ve made an impact in other stu-
dents’ lives,” Chea said. “We want 
to make sure that each community 
is welcome here, and can pursue an 
education here.”

that is currently ranked fourth in 
the nation. Gstettenbauer started the 
scoring in the game with a counterat-
tack goal with 6:49 left in the first 
quarter. The Rainbows added a score 
of their own at the end of the first 
period to even the score at 1-1. 

Hermann added a goal from the 
flat for the Tritons in the second 
quarter, but Hawaii answered with 
three goals to take a 5-3 lead into 
halftime. UCSD’s defense in the 
third quarter kept the Tritons in the 
game, holding the Rainbows score-
less while sophomore two-meter 
defender Emilia Halmay added a 
goal to cut Hawaii’s lead to 5-4. 

The Tritons were not, howev-
er, able to stop Hawaii as well in 
the fourth quarter as the Rainbows 
added two scores and UCSD was 
only able to post one goal of its own 
from freshman two-meter Janice 
Aguilar. 

“I thought we played pretty well 
against a team that’s ranked fourth 
in the nation,” Hockett said. “We just 

bottom of the sixth. 
Gerckens took Chastain out and 

replaced her with Ward, who was able 
to get the first crucial out by induc-
ing a short pop fly to centerfield. 
Just when it seemed that the Tritons 
might escape the jam and squeak out 
a win, Humboldt’s Caitlin Klug hit a 
heartbreaking grand slam to put the 
Lumberjacks back ahead 5-2, a lead that 
would hold despite a seventh-inning 
Triton run in the eventual 5-3 loss.

“It was a little bit of a mistake pitch 
and [she] made me pay,” Ward said. 
“[Klug] had a really good weekend, it 
was her third homerun of the series but 

that my goal for the evening was to get 
into fisticuffs with a Padres or Dodgers 
fan, but I would have appreciated a 
more reciprocal relationship of rivalry-
fueled shit-talking. Do Dodgers and 
Padres fans just not realize the rich 
history and tradition that the NorCal/
SoCal baseball rivalries represent?

Even though the Padres-Giants 
rivalry is nothing compared to the 
century-old feud between good (the 
Giants) and evil (the Dodgers), the 
National League West compatriots 
have created a very healthy rivalry over 
the past decade. I have a lot of respect 
for the pitching-rich Padres and must 
tip my cap to their gorgeous stadium, 
which still doesn’t hold a candle to 

China Basin. Enough important games 
have been played by these two teams 
that one would expect the animosity to 
be such that four Giants fans wouldn’t 
be able to stroll into Petco Park and do 
as they please. At any Giants game in 
San Francisco, local fans never cease 
to yell, torment and verbally abuse any 
person wearing colors besides orange 
and black. 

For all that goes into the 
Giants-Padres-Dodgers triangle of 
California baseball, I would hope 
that all fans would fulfill their duties 
of maintaining the bitter rivalries 
from the ground level. Is it conceiv-
able that, as a supporter of a team 
that might lose 90 games this year, 
my shrieks and tirades at Friday’s 

game were simply not taken serious-
ly? Possibly. But all that I’m looking 
for is San Diego fans to hate me a bit 
more, of course not as a person but 
as a representative of a rival team. 

I just want these fans to engage 
more in all aspects of supporting 
their team; rooting for a baseball 
team is not just about watching the 
game and knowing stats, it’s about 
having pride in where you’re from 
and not letting anybody take that 
away from you. So while I was 
strolling around the aisles of Petco 
Park last week, I secretly yearned 
for somebody to return one of my 
chants, to yell at me, or even better, 
to throw a beer or two in my face. Is 
that too much to ask?

With only one game left in the reg-

ular season, the Tritons have their eyes 
set on the WWPA Championships on 
April 25-27 in Los Angeles.

“We’re going to see Loyola 
Marymount again and if we beat 
them and UC Davis we’ll win confer-
ence and go to NCAA for the first 
time in about 10 years,” Hockett said. 
“Beating LMU shows that we can do 
that.”

In UCSD’s senior game on April 
17, the Tritons will face Cal Baptist at 
home. UCSD hopes to end the regu-
lar season on a high note before the 
WWPA Championships.

“That will be a good game to 
execute some of the things we did 
against LMU against an opponent 
that’s not quite as competitive,” 
Hermann said. “We want to play 
with the same intensity and the same 
focus on offense.”

SOFTBALL — Facing their toughest 
opponent of the 2008 season, the Tritons 
dropped all four games in their week-
end series against the Humboldt State 
University Lumberjacks. UCSD came 
away with a 5-2 win over Humboldt 
in a nonconference game  earlier in 
the year, but mustered only six runs 
en route to being swept by the sixth-
ranked Lumberjacks. With the losses, 
UCSD now falls to 28-18 overall with a 
13-13 CCAA record, while Humboldt 
grabs sole possession of first place with 
a record of 40-14 (17-7 CCAA). 

Despite the four-game sweep, the 
Tritons are still in a solid position to 
make the CCAA playoffs, but must use 
the remaining six conference games to 
regain their lost momentum. 

“[Dropping the four games against 
Humboldt] shows that we have our 
work cut out for us and we need to go 
from here,” senior left-hander Melissa 
Ward said. “I think we know what we 
need to do now; we know how we 
have to play so that makes our next six 
games matter all that much more.”

All season long the Tritons have 
won behind their stellar pitching staff, 
with their offense coming alive in spurts 
just often enough to deliver many cru-
cial wins. This past weekend, however, 
Humboldt’s Lizzy Prescott outshined 
UCSD’s pitchers, rendering what few 
runs the Tritons were able to score 
almost meaningless. Prescott pitched 
every inning of the four-game series, 
picking up four wins and 33 strikeouts 

defense like always.”
The win came after two close 

losses to higher-ranked opponents 
in which the Tritons could not pro-
vide enough offense to secure vic-
tories.

“We were coming off two close 
games and it was good to get a vic-
tory in the third one,” Hockett said.

One of those close losses came 
from the University of Hawaii, a team 

BEAT L.A.! BEAT L.A.! BEAT L.A.!”Last Friday night I found 
myself surrounded by these melodic 
chants, inspiring words that have, for 
half a century, brought people together 
in their shared hatred of the dreaded 
Los Angeles Dodgers. As a die-hard 
San Francisco Giants fan, this chant 
was as central to my childhood educa-
tion as were my ABCs. Growing up, I 
could easily rattle off dates and names 
of the age-old Giants-Dodgers rivalry, 
knowing more about Bobby Thompson 
than I did about Bobby Kennedy. 

As I heard these heart-warming 
chants last week, I found myself in 
unusual surroundings. My beloved 
Giants were probably downing a few 
pints each of Milwaukee’s finest after 
a thoroughly abusive 13-4 loss to the 
Brewers, yet the chorus of “Beat L.A.” 

still rang through my ears. For me, 
rooting against the Dodgers is syn-
onymous with spending chilly Friday 
nights at the beautiful ballpark by the 
bay. But for the first time I found 
myself yelling my lungs off at the boys 
in blue with no fog engulfing the field, 
no Bay Bridge dotting the horizon and 
not a single clam-chowder bread bowl 
in sight. 

Instead of booing the Dodgers from 
the cozy confines of the Giants’ home 
stadium at 24 Willie Mays Plaza, I was 
in downtown San Diego taking in a 
game at Petco Park. A group of friends 
and I, all faithful to the Giants, decided 
to attend the Padres-Dodgers Friday 
night game.

Although our beloved Giants 
weren’t playing, we decided to show 
up to the kennel decked out in every 
article of Giants attire we owned, with 
one of our party going as far as to pimp 
out her ears with orange-and-black 
“SF” earrings. Not only did we try as 
hard as we could to stick out like a sore, 
orange thumb in an otherwise bland 
sea of blue, but we also made sure to 
be as obnoxious as possible about it. By 
the time most Padres fans were final-
ly arriving at the game in the fourth 
inning, my friends and I were already 
starting to lose our voices from cheer-
ing so loudly. What could you possibly 
cheer about when our own team was 
halfway across the country and all the 
way in the division cellar?

One of my friends, a rather gregari-
ous gentleman, did not let up in chant-
ing “LET’S GO GIANTS!” as we walked 
around the ballpark. Considering we 
bought standing-room-only tickets, we 
walked around a lot and cheered for 
the Giants from every corner of Petco. 
What surprised me, however, was the 
almost complete lack of scorn that we 
received. We were walking around a 
rival’s home field, talking smack to 
both the host Padres and the visiting 
Dodgers while sporting enemy colors, 
yet most of the fans around that eve-
ning let us walk right over them. 

Yeah, there was the occasional 
“Why are you even at this game?” or 
“Fuck San Francisco!” but for the most 
part our incessant rants and cheers 
were met with high levels of Southern-
California complacency. I’m not saying

UCSD Upsets LMU After Tough Loss

Softball Swept By First-Place Lumberjacks

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN
The 17th-ranked Tritons bounced back from a close 7-5 loss to the University of Hawaii by toppling the second-place Loyola Marymount Lions 9-7 on April 12.

WATER POLO — After losing two 
close games to high-ranking oppo-
nents, No. 17 UCSD needed to 
beat a strong team to prove that 
its goal of winning the upcoming 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships is possible. The 
Tritons got that victory on April 12, 
using a strong third quarter to power 
a 9-7 victory over WWPA rival and 
12th-ranked Loyola Marymount 
University to even out their record 
at 16-16 and post a win over one 
of the top conference teams. The 
Tritons posted the victory after a 
tough home loss on April 9 to No. 
4 University of Hawaii by a score 
of 7-5. 

“Our biggest rivals in the confer-
ence are Loyola Marymount and 
UC Davis,” senior goalkeeper Kim 
Hockett said. “We’d only beaten 
[Loyola Marymount] a couple times 
since I’ve been playing before this 
win.”

Both teams had no trouble find-
ing the goal early in the game, each 
scoring three goals early in the first 
period. With one second left in the 
first quarter, the Lions scored a goal 
to put UCSD in a 4-3 hole. The scor-
ing subsided in the second quarter 
when each team scored only one 
goal, leaving Loyola Marymount 
clinging to a 5-4 halftime lead. Still, 
since the Tritons had been held to 
five or less goals in three of their 
past four contests, their four, first-
quarter goals were encouraging.

“We took good shots and shot 
the ball well,” Hockett said. “We also 

took a lot of shots.”
UCSD continued its solid offen-

sive effort in the third quarter while 
simultaneously stepping up its 
defense. The Tritons capitalized on 
scores from senior utility Nicole 
Hermann and sophomore util-
ity Stephanie Bocian to take a 6-5 
lead. With three seconds left in the 
quarter and the Tritons having held 
the Lions scoreless for the entire 
period, junior attacker Sydney 
Gstettenbauer added another goal  

to take a 7-5 lead into the fourth 
quarter.

The Tritons added another quick 
goal in the fourth period from 
Gstettenbauer, scoring her fourth 
of the game to extend UCSD’s lead. 
The three-goal cushion was enough 
for Hockett and the Tritons’ stingy 
defense as UCSD came out with a 
hard-fought 9-7 victory. 

“We played excellent against 
LMU,” Hermann said. “Our offense 
was great and we played solid 

over her 28 innings.
“Prescott just kept the hitters guess-

ing a lot; she had a good rise ball that 
people would swing through and then 
she would come back and spot up 
strikes,” Ward said. “She’s a good pitch-
er and she  kept our bats off balance.”

Game one saw Ward, UCSD’s ace, 
go toe-to-toe with Prescott in what 
proved to be a classic pitcher’s duel. 
Ward allowed a second-inning run on 
a pair of Lumberjack hits but yielded 
nothing else while throwing a complete 
game — the 79th of her career — to 
move her into first place all-time for 
UCSD in that category. Humboldt’s 
one-run cushion was all the wiggle 
room the All-American Prescott need-
ed, striking out 12 Tritons and allowing 
only three base runners. Both UCSD 
hits came off the bat of junior right 
fielder Allison May, who doubled with 
two outs in the seventh inning but was  
stranded, representing the tying run.

Head coach Patti Gerckens sent 
junior pitcher Lauren Chastain to the 
mound to start in game two, but the 
durable right-hander was unable to 
make it out of the first inning after 
allowing three Lumberjack runs to cross 
the plate. After the early Humboldt 
scoring, Ward came back in but fared 
no better, giving up a pair of homeruns 
to extend the Lumberjack lead to 5-0. 
The Tritons finally broke through off 
Prescott in the top of the sixth as fresh-
man shortstop Sarah Woofter smashed 
a two-run homerun and senior second 
baseman Danielle Lukk picked up an 
RBI single to pull within two runs, 5-3. 
Humboldt answered UCSD’s rally with 
three runs of its own in the bottom half 
of the inning to regain a five-run lead 
and guarantee a sweep in the opening 
doubleheader. 

The games on April 12 eerily mim-
icked the first two contests of the series, 
as Prescott again threw a two-hit shut-
out in the morning game and was able 

to hold off a late Triton rally in the 
nightcap to seal the sweep. In the third 
game of the series, Prescott handcuffed 
UCSD for the first six frames before 
May and junior first baseman Jenni 
Habib singled to break up the no-hit-
ter in the seventh inning. Ward again 
threw a complete game, giving up only 
one earned run, but found herself on 
the short end of a 2-1 loss. 

On the verge of their first series 
sweep of the season, the Tritons turned 
in a gutsy team performance that 

Two shutout losses set 
the tone for a weekend 
of frustrating play as the 
Tritons gear up for their 
final conference games.
