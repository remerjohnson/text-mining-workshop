headquarters of Sigma Phi

the charter of its UC Davis 
affiliate last month. The 
national fraternity's decision, 
which will take effect for five 
years, was based on financial 
difficulty and a string of 
hilling incidents. "We did 
nothing big wrong, but since 
we did many small things

Flyer Accuses A.S. Council of Racism 
CONTROVERSY: Voz 
Fronteriza editor blasts 
flyer for paternalism, 
opportunism 
By Philip Michaela 
News Editor 

The editor of Voz Fronteriza, 
the A.S.-funded Chicano campus 
newspaper, said that he and his 
staff had nothing to do with a flyer 
that appeared on campus last week 
accusing the Associated Students 
Council of racism. 

The flyer, which calls for stu-
dents to "Impeach the racist A.S. 
bureaucrats," was posted around 
campus on Thursday, one day af-
ter the A.S. Council rejected a 
request by Voz Fronteriza to real-
locate $250 from the newspaper's 
printing budget to its mail services 
budget. The council had-debated

Editor in Chief Harry Barra. 

Barra said the newspaper made 
the request as part of its growing 
outreach effort in the San Diego 
area. "Since we are a voice to the 
Chicano Mexicano community, it 
would be important to continue 
our outreach to our community in 

San Diego," he said. 
According to A.S. Commis-

sioner of Communications Bik-
Na Park, the reallocation would 
have given Voz Fronteriza a $500 
mail services budget for the rest of 
the year. The council feltthatsince 
the newspaper is funded by UCSD 
student fees, VozFronteriza should 
be primarily available to UCSD 
students, Park said. "Student me-
dia are supposed to benefit stu-
dents directly," she said. 

"The council thought it was 
inappropriate to give money to 
something that went off campus," 
Park added. "Five hundred dollars 
is too much." 

The controversial flyer blasted 
the A.S. for its decision. "Once 
again 'our' student government 
has turned its back on those they

Racism 
POUCY: Some 
UCSD employees feel 
that discrimination is 
still widespread in the 
university workplace 
By Eric Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

Editor 's Note: Part One in a 
continuing series 

As university administrator 
boost support to affirmative 
action programs, some UCSD 
employees still claim racial dis-
crimination is widespread. 

Michael Goh, an Asian-
American financial analyst for 
Telecommunications Services, 
has missed his chance for pro-
motion three times since 1989. 
The third time, Goh said he lost 
to his less qualified competitor 
- the third white man pro-
moted ahead of him. 

Although former supervisor 
Al Shaw reporteJ that Goh was 
an "outstanding" employee and 
Goh had 10 years of experience 
in his field, Goh said a recent 
college graduate whom he had 
trained was promoted instead. 

Goh said he didn ' t complain 
until his boss cited his alleg-
edly poor English accent as a 
reason for not promoting him. 
Goh filed a grievance, but he 
said that problems with the sys-
tem and administrators who side 
only with managers kept his 
case from being fairly heard. 

"Discrimination is wide-
spread, and the university is 
compounding the problem by 
not wanting to deal with it," 
Goh said.

Physics Students Protest Manda~ory Retake Exam 
ByD ...... K .... w 
Guardian Reporter 

Angered by the Physics 
Department's decision to hold a 

manda~ory retake exam for last 
quarter's Physics 2A class, a group 
of students are holding a petition 
drive to challenge the decision. 

The Physics 2A final, originally 
held on Dec. 9, was interrupted 
when a smoke grenade was set off 
in Warren Lecture Hall 200S. It is 
uncertain whether the smoke gre-
nade was thrown into the class or 
ignited from inside. 

David Petrini, a Warren Col-
lege freshmarr, said the exam had 
progressed for 20-25 minutes when 
the disruption occurred. At that 
time, he said, the students started 
running out of the class. 

In a letter addressed to all Phys-
ics 2A students who took the exam, 
Hans Paar, the Physics 
Department's Vice Chairman of 
Education, said a second exam will 
be given because of suspected 
cheating, and "a number of people 
were understandably stressed and 
distracted by the incident and the 

journey to an alternate classroom 
(in the UCSD School of Medicine) 
and have reported that their perfor-
mance was adversely affected." 

Muir College sophomore 
Norma Rosalyz is heading an ef-
fort to change the retake exam 
from "mandatory" to "optional." 
In a petition drive, she has cOl-
lected 71 signatures, in addition to 
30 signatures which have been lost, 
from students who "believe that 
the forced retaking of the physics 
final would be unjust." One hun-
dred-fifty students were enrolled 

in the class last quarter, according 
to Professor Jos~ Onuchic. 

The petition signers argue that 
the retake exam conflicts with 
studying for Winter Quarter mid-
terms, students should have been 
more involved tn the decision-
making and that grades from 
weekJy quizzes and the Dec. 9 
final exam are accurate indica-
tions of course performance. 

Many students continued to 
take the exam by sitting outside 
the lecture hall, according to

UCSD Student Finalist 
For Regent Position 

ETCETERA. • • 
CHOICE: Guevara, two others willbe considered by

By Jonn. Pilmer 
Associate News Editor 

A UCSD student is among tbe 
finalists to serve as University of 
California student regent next year. 
Poncho Guevara, a Warren Col -
lege enior, was chosen as one of 
the three student regent finalists at 
a meeting of the University of

Association 
(UCSA) at UCSD 
last weekend. 

ideas about what a student regent 
should be. 

"One of the biggest honors 
about this thing is to be chosen by 
the students," he said. 

While the majority of the stu-
dent regent selection process is 
conducted by UC students, the fi-
nal selection will be made by a 

committee of four 
to five members of 
the Board of Re-
gents at its meet-
ing thi s week in 
Los Angel es. 
Guevara could 
learn as early as 
Thursday if he has 
been approved by 
the committee. 

A spokesman 
for the UCSA said 
that the student lob-
bying group was 
not relea ing the 
names of the three 
finalists at the re-
quest of the UC 
Office of the Presi-
dent. H o wever, 
Guevaraconfirmed 
that he is one of the 
three finalists sub-
mitted to the Board 
of Regents for con-
sideration .

According to

applications are 
handed in and re-
viewed. Candi-
dates from 
throughout Cali-

years, and has served as the chair 
of the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee (SAAC). Guevara also 
helped form the Chicanos and 
Latinos for Creative Medicine club 
on campus. 

Guevara said that interests such 
as these lead him to be more con-
fident in his ability to be an effec-
tive student regent. "I've had other 
challenges before. I've balanced 
things like course work and extra-
curricular activities," Guevara 
said. 

"Delegation is something you 
learn after being [at UCSD]," he 
added. 

Guevara said he was somewhat 
surprised by his selection. When 

"nterviewed by the UCSA selec-
tion committee, Guevara said he 
didn't prepare much, but simply 
acted like himself. 

"I didn ' t really put a lot of pres-
sure on myself," said Guevara, 
adding that he was happy that the 
UCSA seemed to agree with his 

every campus. 
Once the initial interviews have 

taken place, four candidates from 
northern California and four from 
southern California are inter-
viewed again, this time by the 
UCSA. 

The field is narrowed down to 
three student regent finalists, who 
are sent to the UC regents to be 
interviewed a final time before a 
decision is reached by the regents' 
committee. 

Guevara said that the three in-
terviews usually lasted from a 
half-hour to an hour and were 
quite varied in their approach. 
"This last one had a mock regent 
setting with the UCSA," he added. 
"The whole process has been re-
ally exciting." 

Guevara said that the regents 
will inform him of their -decision 
sometime this weekend, although 
the selection will not be final until 
sometime in February, when an 
official vote by the entire board 
will take place.

Undergraduate applications to the University of 
Califomla for next fall rose by three percent this year, 
reversing a two-year decline. The Increase Included a 
nearly fIVe percent jump In the number of Califomia 
high school students applying to the university. 

The percentage Increase in Califomia freshman 
applications was greater than the 1.5 percent growth 
anticipated in the number of students graduating from 
the state's public high schools this spring. 

While there were gains for all ethnic groups, applic~ 
tions from underrepresented students - African Amer\-
can, Chicano and Latino - made up the majority of the 
increase, accordlr( to figures released by the UC OffIce 
of the President. The number of Chicano applicants 
grew 16.1 percent, Latino applicants 13.9 percent and 
African American applicants 10.4 percent. 

· We believe this uptum indicates that more of 
Callfomia's young people are seeking out hi&tKIuality 
undergraduate programs and the university's efforts 
to keep its programs affordable are succeeding, • said 
Dennis Galilgar!, UC assistant vice president for 
student academic services. 

Overall, undergraduate applications for fall, 1994, 
totaled 65,411, an increase of 1,822. At UCSD, the 
number of applications rose by 1.9 percent, from 
23,124 In 1993 to 23,513 in 1994. 

The OffIce of the President also released enroll-
ment figures for fall, 1993, showing that systemwide 
enrollment dropped by 1.6 percent. The ' university 
attribute<! the decrease to a rise in graduation rates. 

·Our review of the data found that the number of 
new students was about the same as a year ago, while 
the number of continuing students dropped by almost 
1,BOO,· Galliganl said. 

·We believe the dip In the number of continuing 
students was primarily because more undergraduates 
earned degrees last year,· he added. 

Galligani said there are several possible reasons 
for the Increase In students who graduated - the

Medicine Prof .... Lectur .. on 
DIffIculties of Dru, Development 

Elizabeth J. Ziegler, a professor of medicine at the 
UCSD Medical School, will discuss the 2O-year effort 
of a UCSD laboratory to develop a human antibody 
against a bacterial endotoxin for the treatment of 
patients with gram-negative septic shock, and the 
dIfficulties of licensing such a drug, as part of the 
School of Medicine Faculty DIstinguIshed Lecture on 
Thursday, Jan. 21. 

The lecture will be held In Garren Auditorium In the 
Basic Science Building at 4:30 p.m. The School of 
MedicIne's 1993-94 Faculty Distinguished Lecture 
Series Is free and open to the public. 

Gram-negative bacteremia accounts for 30 to 40 
percent of all cases of spesls, a life-threatening III· 
ness, and for perhaps 50,000 deaths per year In the 
United States. 

A human antl-endotoxln monoclonal antibody was 
shown to be protective against death from gram-
negative' bacteremia and shock In clinical trials at 24 
medical centers In North AmerIca and Europe, Includ-
Ing the UCSD Medical Center, but was not licensed for 
legal, politIcal and financial reasons. 

ZIegler's lecture will deal with the difficulties of 
biotechnology drug development in the modem era. 

Ziegler first came to UCSD in 1970 as a research 
fellOW in the laboratory of Ian nfectlous disease re-
searcher, the late Abraham I. Bradue. She joined the 
faculty of the School of Medicine In 1913.

Blue Fences' Creator Speaks at Revelle LIGHTS & SIRENS 
ARTIST: At Monday 
night speech, Irwin 
discussed myths about 
art, his contribution to 
the Stuart collection 
By IVln Delventhal 
Guardian Reporter 

In a two hour talk that addressed 
• the misconceptions many people 

have about modern art, Robert 
Irwin, an artist whose work is fea-
tured in the Stuart Collection, ap-
peared at Revelle College last 
Monday. 

Irwin began his discussion with 
the 25 students in attendance by 
describing art as a " non-thing," 
seeming to possess no physical 
qualities and yet having an infinite 
number of physical qualities. 

FLYER: Voz 
editor says paper can 
act on its own behalf 
Continued from pace 1 
the flyer, adding that the realloca-
tion had been discussed in a posi-
tive manner. "As editor, I came 
out satisfied with their decision, 
and historically, with whattheA.S. 
and university represent I'm not 
pissed off," Barra said. " What does 
piss me off is this [flyer.)" 

Barra did not know who was 
responsible for putting out the flyer, 
but said he resented the fact that 
those responsible were assuming the 
staff of Voz Fronleriza was inca: 

Irwin, who spoke with fervor many 
times during the evening, at-
tempted to break down his own 
understanding of art into laymen's 
terms. 

Two myths about art are that it 
is an act of expression or a form of 
communication, Irwin said. "If art 
is a form of expression, what do 
we do that does not express some-
thing?" he asked . 

Art is not a separate entity, Irwin 
said, but rather an intrinsic part of 
the natural state of things. Accord-
ing to Irwin, art is not a form of 
communication because every 
piece means something different 
for every person. 

Irwin said that asking "What 
does it mean?" about a piece of 
modern art is a question that will 
get you nowhere. Just like a paint-

ing does not stop at the edge of a 
canvas, he aoded, art does not have 
some limited existence that can be 
independently examined. Instead, 
art "lives, breathes and works" as 
an integral piece in a higher order 
where multiple and often contra-
dictory truths can exist simulta-
neously. 

Irwin may be best known by 
UCSD students for his 1983 contri-
bution to the Stuart Collection -
the elevated blue fencing in the 
eucalyptus grove behind the Sun 
God. Irwin described the reasoning 
behind the project as "a desire to 
make something that was a piece or 
part of what already was going on." 

He added that he did not want 
to obscure in any way the natural 
beauty of the grove, but rather 
sought to make people notice it.

Park, who had not yet seen the 
flyer, said that she did not believe 
the council's decision was based on 
prejudice or race. "I don't believe 
our council is racist, obviously," 
said Park, adding that the council 
had to look ou t for the interests of aJ I 
students in its decisions.

CULTURAL WARS: In the past year, 
"gangsta rap" has become a magnet for 

public controversy. Are the violent and sexist 
messages common to this genre really 

dangerous, or are they only words? 

LANGUAGE 

C OM MEN TAR Y: Despite the current fervor over "gangsta rap," violent 
themes have long been a facet of art and popular culture 

B Y D A V I D • NOW, SEN lOR S T A F F W R I T E R 

t has been said that murder 
is the ultimate high. As this 
nasty, age-old secret has 
found its way into rap mu-
sic, self-proclaimed public 
guardians have raised the 
alarm about declining stan-
dards of decency and ethics 

in America. But lewdness in music is 
nothing new and the currently popular 
"gangsta rap," with its glorification of 
murder and abuse of women, will 
eventually go out of style and be re-
placed by some other distraction for 
the public to fret about. 

Gangsta rap first started shocking 
Americans when groups like N.W.A. 
and lce-T began rapping about the 
realities of ghetto life and gang men-
tality. The first public debate over the 
virtue of such in-your-face rap con-
cemed "Cop Killer" by lce-T's Body 

Count. The hype did wonders for the 
SlIIes of this otherwise-unlistenable 
release and had some Americans ac-
tually believing that policemen were 
more at risk because of a song. 

But now, with the incredible suc-
cess of the Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy 
Doggalbums, concemed citizens may 
have something to talk about. Though 
most of the subject matter on Dr. 
Ore's The Cronic and Snoop Dogg's 
Doggystyle is typical rapper bravadO, . 
the most memorable rhymes go a tad 
beyond that. 

But kids aren't buying Dr. Dreand 
Snoop Dogg because they want to 
hear the f-word repeated over and 
over again. They're buying it because 
it's extremely energetic, well-done 
rap. The bad message is just a fringe 
benefit. 

Or. Dre,formerN.WA.frontman, 

produced both albums, and he has a 
knack for putting out hip-bop like no 
other. The Cronic is amazingly well-
produced and has segues between 
songs that are as sophisticated as any-
thing Pink Floyd has recorded. These 
albums would have gone platinum 
even without the profanity. 

To be sure, these two albums get 
very raw. If Ku Klux Klan members 
were clever enough, they would have 
thought ofthis years ago. Forget kill-
ing cops, Ore and Snoop spin yams 
about killing other blacks. For in-
stance, Ore raps: 

Rat-tat-tat tat-tal-tat like thai 
Never hesitate to put a nigger on 

his back 
Black women, in particular, get 

the blunt end of the rap, they are often 
described as objects to be used and

C OM MEN TAR Y: The music industry is selling racism, misogyny and 
violence to American youth, and the ramifications are serious 

BY MIGUEL BUCKENIIEYER, SENIOR 5 TAFF WRITER 

R ecordcompaniesandex-ecutives are making a killing by marketing the latest coalescent genre of 
music known as "gangsta 

rap." Though trends come and go, the 
message that youth receives through 
the inundation of violent, racist and 
sexist music may make its repercus-

sionsfelt for yearstocome. Gangsta 
rap has rightfully been decried 

as culturally .and morally 
deleterious to both 

lower- and middle-
class America. 

As the c0rpo-
rate profiteers 
know, tbe larg-
est group of 
gansta rap lis-
teners are white, 

suburban youth. Ironically, its suc-
cess with this group lies in its very 
dissimilarity to the subwban life ex-
perience. Gangsta rap acts asa mecha-
nism through which suburban kids 
can "experience" the inner-<ity cul-
ture without ever having to step foot 
outside of thei r gated community. It's 
sort of a virtual experience that deliv-
ers much of the "pleasure" without 
the complimentary risk. 

But if gangsta rap music becomes 
one of the only "authentic" COI\DCC-
lions that middle-class whites have to 
the ghetto and the urban black com· 
munity, then its barrage of murder-
ous, gender oppressive and self-de-
structive messages will become the 

porthole tlJrough which many young, 
white suburbanites see their black, 
inner-city counterparts. 

If this is indeed true, taken with 
other media stereotypes, it's entirely 
plausible that many young whites will 
expect urban black males to act as 
"niggaz," to beat and sexually subju-
gate women and, perhaps, even to kill 
impulsively. Similarly, they might ex-
pect black women to be "hos," not 
worthy of respect. 

As David Samuels ~ in 71te 
New Republic, "This kind of con-
sumption of racist stereotypes, ofbru-
taIity toward women ... is of a particu-
luly corrupting kind. The values it 
instills find their ultimate expression 
in the ease with which we watch young 
black men killing each other: in mov-
ies, on records and on the streets of 
cities and towns aaoss the country." 

Though a proportionally larger 
market than whites, urban blacks are 
the second largest group of gangsta 
rap listeners. If the gangsta beat has a 
toxic ctIcct on suburban youths, it bas 
• lethal one on those that live in the

And then I'm through with it,

Jlad enough? Well, such lyrics 
have not gone unnoticed by people, 
particularly concemed citizens in the 
African-American community. Rap 
artists are increasingly being asked to 
elaborate on exactly what they mean 
by "trick-ass bitch." 

Most gangsta rap apologists, like 
lce-T, defend their music as merely 
descriptive of real life in the 'hood. 
11le descriptionsofmurders and drive-
bys, they say, are mostly gang-life 
fairy tales and are not meant to be 
emulated by their listeners.

ghetto. Donna Britt of the Washing-
ton Post has recently written about the 
message tbat record companies "are 
selling to-and about-blacks: You 
don't deserve to live. Your women 
are sluts and animals. You kill with-
out remorse, and copulate without 
loveorrespom;ibility. Sure that's all a 
lie. But slap a beat on it, apply a coat 
of glamour and someone will dance to 

music bas always bad a special plllClC 
for death and murder. "Frankie and 
Johnnie,". folk song many of us have 
heard, is about a woman shooting her 
husband aftet she catches him with ' 
another woman. I don't think this 
song has inspired all too many hus-
band-killings over the years. So when 
Snoop Dogg raps about getting out of 
prison and shooting his cheating 
woman, it may not be right, but it's 
nothing new. It's just tale-telling. 

The list continues: "Staggerlee" is 
about murder during a game of craps, 
"Tom Dooley" is about a guy about to 
get hanged, "Hey Joe" is about Joe 
shooting his "old lady." Why all the 
songs about killing? Murder is one of 
those interesting subjects that can't be 
passed up by art, and gangsta rllp has 
embraced it in its most virulent form. 

Woman-bashing is also no nov-
elty, although it is being viewed as 
increasingly uncool. The mainstream 
media, like gansta rappers, capitaljze 
on the entertainment value of portray-
ing women as bad drivers, gossipers, 
gold-diggers, etc .... This trend is re-

it." 
The marketing of such messages 

is particularly deleterious to urban 
communities. The lack of inner-city 
role models has left a conspicuous 
void which has been filled by drug-
traffickers, career criminals and now 
by gangster rap artists (some of whom 
have been indicted for the same vio-
lent crimes they sing about). Numer-
ous sociologists attribute the loss of 
inner-city role models to poverty ,high-
unemployment and the flight of the 
black middle class to the suburbs. 

University of Chicago scholar 
William Wilson believes that black 
middle-class professionals used to be

an essential ingredient to the sta.!)ility 
of inner-city communities, providing 
it not only with job opportunities, but 
also important social norms like the 
work ethic, love and civility. 1beir 
departure, coupled with the exponen-
tial increases in black male jobless-
ness, single-parent families and ille-
gitimacy have left inner -ci ty youths 
with few role models. An "opposi-
tional culture" that romanticizes vio-
lence bas arisen in this vacuum. 

The marketingofgangsta rap only 
exacerbates this ghetto gestalt. While 
I will stop short of decrying this as a 
media conspiracy, the marketing of 
gangsta rap to urban black youth is not 

ceding and it's only a matter of time 
before rap music catches up. A new 
generation of rappers will most likely 
have a more advanced viewofwomen. 
And as more women rappers join their 
ranks, this trend will only be strength-
ened. 

The most important thing to re-
member is that as public opinion and 

. tastes change, the current form of 
gangsta rap will fade from popularity. 
Remember when Andrew Dice Clay 
and Sam Kineson were touring the 
country and appearing on cable TV 
with jokes about starving Mricans 
andAJDS victims? Everyone thought 
that American entertainment would 
never recover. But now, no one tells 
jokes about those subjects anymore 
- or at least not that I've heard. 

Furthermore, rap is not the only 
form of music that has been claimed 
to be spreading mayhem throughout 
the world. Way back in the '80s, heavy 
metal, at its most potent, had refer-
ences to satanism and death. Slayer 
sang songs about Auschwitz and 
necrophilia. But who listens to that 

to be taken lightly. It takes on the 
appearance of institutional racism -
mostly white entertai nment execu-
tives selling and branding to inner-
city blacks music which uses racial 
epitaphS, glorifies black -on-black vio-
lence and perpetuates a belief that 
woman are prostitutes to whom no 
sexual fidelity is owed. 

Fortunately,grass-roots level pres-
sure is having an effect in the battle 
against the accessibility of gangsta 
rap. Many radio stations are refusing 
to air songs that promulgate racist, 
misogynistic and self-destructive val-
ues. A compendium of groups are 
pressuring record companies to dis-

anymore? Rockers now have to sing 
about alienation and bitterness to get 
the seal of approval. Eddie Vedder 
would be laughed at if he performed 
"Shout at the Devil," 

Public intolerance for violent 
gangsta rap will no doubt playa role in 
its demise, but all the jabber about 
"hos" and "glocks" will simply be-
come blase. And besides, young men 
are quickly learning that their dates do 
not want to hear Snoop Dogg croon-
ing, "With my nuts on yo' tonsils ... ~ 
in the background. 

Yes, the message of some of these 
lyrics is reprehensible. However, mi-
sogyny and murder are nothing new. 
As long as there are angry young men, 
these themes will resurrect themselves 
in different forms. The current, most 
popular form of art that exploits this 
negative imagery is gangsta rap. But 
rap will move on and the gangsta 
variety will not always be at the van-
guard. Violence shows up in every 
other form of pop culture. Rap was 
just a late bloomer. 

continue marketing gangsta rap. And 
newspapers and magazines nation-
wide have criticized record compa-
nies in editorials. 

The main issue, however, is profit. 
As long as there is money to be made 
by distributing such a medium, some-
one will sell it. The Rev. Jesse Jack-
son understands this well . He has re-
centlysaid, "We' re going to take away 
the market value of these attacks on 
our person. Anyone, white or blade, 
who makes money calling our women 
bitches and our people niggers will 
have to face the wrath of indignation." 
Let us just hope that our indignation is 
enough.

COMMENTARY: Without self-esteem, even all of the intelligence and talent 
in the world are just not enough to make it 

REMEMBERING A loST FRIEND 

DAN 

HHTTI5 

) often wonder what has be-
come of "Jason," my best friend 
of nine years. The last time I saw 
him was several months ago, and 
) don't know what has happened 
to him or where he has gone since . 

Jason is a smart, kind, gener· 
ous, honest and loyal friend, who 
also happens to be Latino and 
very poor. 

But during the span of our 
friendship, ) saw my friend, who 
started out with such promise, fall 
victim to his own lack of self-
confidence and crumpling mo-

rale as the world continued to beat him down. 
It was really after graduating from high school that I 

saw Jason and his self-esteem take a serious beating. In 
high school, Jason was an excellent student with a 3.8 
GP A. He had been told by University of California minor-
ity recruiters that his academic record was such that he 
could get into any UC school and receive significant 
financial aid. His future seemed bright. 

Then his troubles really began. Jason ultimately de· 
cided 10 go to community college and transfer later, since 
it would be cheapest. But his mother (who had struggled to 
raise him as a single parent on minimum wage) unexpect-
edly told him thafshe was leaving California for Texas for 
financial reasons. 

Suddenly, Jason was in dire straits. He would have no 
place to live, since the community college had no housing. 
Since it was too late to apply to the UC schools, I urged him 
to apply to the local Cal State school, which would at least 
provide him with housing. 

After my conStant nagging, he applied to Cal State and 
for financial aid. Once at the university, he seemed to get 
his act together. 

For as long as I had known Jason, he had been writing 
short stories and poetry. After my parents and I suggested 
that he could major in creative writing and m~ybe even 
become a teacher, he became very excited and took our 
advice to heart. His life finally seemed to have direction 
and for his first two quarters, he eamed a 3.5 G PA, working 
part-time in the cafeteria. 

Then cruel fate stepped in again. His student fees were 
raised while his scholarship wasn't. His meal plan was 
revoked after he fell behind in his payments, and he was 
forced to get a second part-time job at McDonald's. His 
grades plummeted because he had to work instead of 
attend class. 

Meanwhile, be was forced to stick out the quarter with 
his full course load because otherwise his scholarship 
would be revoked and he would end up owing thousands 
of dollars more. Despite all his efforts, it took a loan from 
my parents to allow him to payoff the debt. 

Mentally and physically exhausted, Jason decided to 
take leave from the university, and my family let him stay 
with us for awhile until he got back on his feet. He found 
a job at the local AM/PM market working the dreary 
graveyard shift every night at minimum wage. He also got 
an apartment. But he was not really living, just surviving. 

And it got worse. He was later falsely accused of 
stealing and was ultimately laid off. At this point, Jason 
completely gave up, losing all hope. He had been knocked 
down so many times that he just didn't have the energy to 

get back up again. 
Jason was reduced to begging, taking out loans from 

friends and whomever he could. For him, this was hitting 
bottom. He bad always been too proud to ask for money or 
loans. But now he had no choice; he also had no way to pay 
back the loans once they were called in. Meanwhile, he 
seemed 10 retreated from reality, spending all his time 
lislening to his tape cOllection and dreaming ofbecorning 
a songwriter like his hero, Peter Cetera. 

I couldn't take it anymore. No matter what I did, I 
couldn't get through to him. I just didn't have the will or 
the energy to keep on peslering and dragging him to 
college admissions offices, job interviews, and so on. It all 
seemed to be in vein. 

The final straw came last winter when we were at the 
city library. I was again (for what seemed like the millionth 
time) trying to motivate him to get his life together. I told 
him that be had to swallow his pride (or what was left of 
it) and apply for all the social welfare aid he could. I said 
that if I were he, I'd move back to Texas where his mom 
and family were and go to community college to get a new 
start on life. ) told him he just couldn't go on like he was; 
I just didn't see how he was going to make it. 

To this be matter-of-factly responded, "Oh well, I 
guess I'll just end up living in the gutter and then buried in 
a shallow grave." 

I exploded, screaming at him right there in the library, 
atthe top of my' lungs, "That's it! I can't take this anymore, 
watching you throw your life down the toilet! Our 
friendship is over until you try to get your act together!" 

And that was the last time I saw Jason. I still feel guilty 
about blowing him offlike that when he was so down and 
out. But nothing else was working. I was drained; I just 
couldn't deal with him anymore and keep my sanity. I 
figured that maybe only something like this could shock 
him into reality. 

I have spoken by phone to Jason one time since then. 
I told him I was still his friend and explained why I had 
exploded like that. But I don't know whitt has happened to 
Jason since then, or if my shock therapy worketl. ) beard 
that he took my advice and went to Texas, but' really don't 
know for sure. 

Looking back, I realize that although Jason was dealt a 
pretty lousy hand in life, that in itself wasn't the problem. 
He often had a way out, an open door - whether it was 
taking advantage of affinnative action programs and 
scholarships or aggressively looking for other jobs. But 
just having an open door isn't always enough. 

The problem was that Jason's self-esteem and morale 
were so battered that he just gave up trying to actually put 
his foot in the door. 

What would have made a difference? This is what I 
keep asking myself. It's obvious something failed him 
here. His smarts, talents, my egging him on, just were not 
enough. Maybe he lacked direction and guidance. Maybe 
he needed a father figure in his life to steer him in the right 
direction. Maybe .... 

1 still think about Jason a lot. And it really hurts. He 
started out with such potential- and he was such a great 
person and friend. 

11le worst part is, I know there are many more "Jasons" 
out there, their self-confidence and hope extinguished by 
similar cruel circumstances. Meanwhile, I can only hope 
that my friend does not succumb to what he said would be 
his fate -to be buried in a shallow grave.

Kalmijn said that UPTE, in as-

sue all discrimination grievances 
and possibly take the cases to the 
Public Employee Relations Board, 
a state body that adjudicates labor 
law.

appropriately. "There has been no

leave, and slam the door. This is 
sending out a message to the guy 
that if he 's not ready to take the 
final, then he can get out of it and 
take it at a later date." 

According to Detective Nate 
Floyd of the UCSD Pol ice, there is 
no information on the suspect. 
" Because it happened so quickly, 
no one was able to get a good look 
at the person," he said. " It 's pretty

cautions because this is such a

cern is that no one was hurt."

said that a recent chancellor's re-
port calling for greater effort to 
meet UCSD Affirmative Action 
goals will be merely words unless 
a better system is created to deal 
with employee grievances. 

"The university admits it has a 
problem [wi th discrimination], but 
they don't have a good way to deal 
with it ," Goh said. 

n African-American animal 
technologl t In the Psychology 
Departmen t, Jeanette Dav i -
Johnson, said she ha~ also hit a 
bureaucratic wall while pu r ulng 
her complaint. Davi. -Johnson, 
who has been working at UCSD 
since March, 1968, said she never 
had any problems with di crimi-
nation until she got a new upervi-

for;' he aid . 
The disruption, resulting in a 

45- minute delay of the exam, 
caused Rosalyz to mi s a non-
refundable, $500 flight from San 
Diego to Houston. "Contrary to 
what you mightthink, I regret more 
the department 's decision of forc-
ing me to take another fi nal than 
the incident itself," said Rosalyz. 
" I was very stressed and panicked 
while taking the final , but I de-
cided to stay to fini sh the test and 
to check my work. 

"I understand the reasons of 
some students for wanting another 
final, and I bel ieve there should be 
another exam-but don ' t make me 
take it," added Rosalyz. " I have 
already fulfilled my obligation by 
taking the fina!."

Muir College Provost Patrick

significant cheating and there 
seems to be some evidence that

POLICY: 
UCSD employees 
criticize procedures 
Continued from paae 7 
other employees in the depart-
ment," said Eric Paavola, Davis-
Johson's UPTE union representa-
tive. 

But the biggest blow, accord-
ing to Davis-Johnson, is that for 
the first time in her25-year career, 
she has to do the job alone. In the 
past, a second employee and a 
part-time student have helped with 
the work, but budget cutbacks have 
made her the sole employee. 

In a job that requires taking 
care of laboratory pigeons and rats, 
including lugging around and 
cleaning heavy cages, lifting heavy 
vats of food and other materials, 
purchasing supplies and cleaning 
the basement level of McGill Hall, 
Davis-Johnson said she has not 
even been given a student two 
hours per week to help her. 

Such help is particularly needed 
since she hurt her arm and has 
more difficulty moving the large 

cages, she said. 
When she complained that she 

and her supervisor were not get-
ting along, Davis-Johnson said her 
complaint was largely ignored at 
first. People who hear the griev-
ances "try to protect the depart-
ment or administration instead of 
trying to solve the problem," she 
said. 

Davis-Johnson wouldn't say 
outright that the problems she had 
were based solely on herskin color. 
Kalmijn, however, said it didn't 
matter whether or not Davis-
Johnson 's supervisor was purpose-
fully racist. "She's one of the only 
African Americans in the depart-
ment. Whether it 's intentional or 
not, it 's racist," Kalmijn said. 

Both Goh and Davis-Johnson 
said the curren.! regulations work 
against employees. Goh had sev-
eral suggestions for improving the 
grievance procedures, including 
the need for an independent party 
to listen to complaints . 

Mike Melman, manager of la-
bor Relations, said employees can 
already choose to use an internal 
or external fact finder and are aI-

The UCSD Guardian 

ways allowed an impartial hear-
ing. 

"I think the university has ex-
cellent policies, has excellent pro-
cedures, does an excellent job in 
providing management with train-
ing .. .. There's always room for 
improvement," Melman said. 

Davis-Johnson said that many 
of the filed grievances could be 
prevented if a more supportive at-
mosphere - in which employees 
could talk openly about their com-
plaints with supervisors - were 
available. 

According to Penn, while em-
ployee policies are not perfect, the 
system is fairly open. "What we're 
trying to do is to beef up the sys-
tem, to handle the complaints at an 
informal level," Penn said. 

In terms of race discrimination, 
Penn said the chancellor released 
his Affirmative Action report in 
December to address the issue. 
"Have we done enough? No. Are 
we doing enough? No. Do we need 
to do more? Yes," he said.

Continued from pae. 1 

"If you allow the exam to be 
optional, then exactly those people 
who cheated would be rewarded, 
and that, to me, would be unjust," 
he added. 

Considering that the final exam 
is worth 40 percent of the course 
grade, and weekly quizzes are 
worth 60 percent, Ledden said, "I 
don't think the department could 
ignore the final exam. So, in the 
presence of a flawed exam, I think 
they had to have another one." 

Rosalyz, however, disputed the 
claim that cheating was prevalent 
in the exam. "Onuchic said that 
any cheating certainly did not make 
a difference in anyone's grade 
because the final grades were, more 
or less, similar to the quizzes," 
Rosalyz added. 

Onochic and Paar would not 
comment further on the situation. 

Some students have said that 
the timing of the exam - right 
before Winter Quarter midterms 
- is a reason for more distress. 
"No matter how much you study 

Tuelday, January 18, 1994 

for this exam, it will take time 
away from studying for other ex-
ams, and it's been a while since we 
took the first final," said Fifth 
College freshman Joseph Cruz. 

Ledden responded that there 
really is no good time to hold a 
retake exam . "I'm sure some 
people are going to be more incon-
venienced than others, but no time 
agrees with everyone. But with the 
incident taking place, I think it 
was important that the department 
come up with a decision that was 
an equal disadvantage to every-
body. And if you don't count the 
final exam (and only average the 
quiz scores), which is another pos-
sibility, then people who were de-
pending on the exam to bring up 
their grade are really put at a ter-
rible disadvantage," he said. 

Rosalyz has also contacted the 
A.S.'s Office of the Student Ad-
vocate. "We're checking univer-
sity policies, procedures and by-
laws right now," said Simran 
Baidwan, issue coordinator for the 
Student Advocates. 

"We need to see if the professor 
has a basis for requesting the en-
tire class to retake a final. We'll 
have a response within the week," 
Baidwan added.

MULTI-MEDIA 
= MESSAGE 

TEACHING: With the help of undergraduates, 
a chemistry professor is using computer and video 

technology to make lectures more accessible 
By Sarah Pitts 
Guardian Reporter 

For most UCSD students, the 
first week of classes brought the 
standard lectures and discussion 
sessions that college students ev-
erywhere have come to expect. 
But for students enrolled in Physi-
cal Chemistry 127 this quarter, 
lectures are quite different, thanks 
to a new technological approach 
used by Chemistry Professor Kent 
Wilson. 

Rather than just reading about 
class topics such as spectroscopy 
and harmonic oscillation, students 
are treated to 3-D visual represen-
tations of the processes they are 
stUdying. Tolllustrate concepts of 
chemistry, 20-foot images of vi-
brating morphing atoms and fly-
ing helicopters are projected onto 
a screen in the classroom. 

Wilson, with the aid of graphic 
designers, has developed a multi-
media extravaganza for the 20 lec-
tures in his Chemistry 127 course. 
The visual production uses rotating 

images accompanied by music to 
present scientific material that has 
previously been limited to the con-
ventionallectures and textbooks. 

Working on state-of-the-art 
Macintosh and Silicon graphics 
computers (the same ones used to 
create the dinosaurs featured in 
the summer blockbuster Jurassic 
Park), multi-media experts have 
combined the styles of Hollywood 

GUARDIAN 

FERTUHES 
and MTV and brought them into 
the classroom. 
n.. .............. 

A group of four artists, known 
as the Senses Bureau, created most 
of the computer-animated graph-
ics used in the lectures. Wilson 
conceptualizes the ideas he wants 
to display during lecture and sub-
mits them to Rob Whitnell, who 

translates them into video imag-
ery. Two UCSD students, Eric 
Fe rnandes and Shadi 
Almassizadeh, provide the com-
puter and video images to illus-
trate the concepts. 

Wilson said he intentionally 
sought contributions from under-
graduates who would help him 
with the multi-media displays. "I 
wanted students to put it together. 
Undergraduates don't know what 
is impossible. Older people are 
sometimes held back by what they 
think can be impossible," Wilson 
said. 

Fernandes, a Warren College 
senior majoring in communica-
tions, had extensive experience in 
video production and multi-media 
for education before working with 
Wilson. Besides servjng as a mul-
ti-media consultant for the San 
Diego Unified School District, 
Fenandes has also worked as a 
beta-tester for IBM's educational 
multi-media division. 

Almassizadeh is a senior the-

and design. He is a part of Presto 
Studio, a San Diego-based soft-
ware company, where he played a 
part in the creation of an awa'id-
winning interactive Macintosh 
game, "The Journeyman Project." 

Almassizadeh said that the pur-
pose of the computer animation is 
to present chemistry concepts that 
aren't easily explained in books. 

As part of the Senses Bureau, 
Almassizadeh has created 3-D 
computer .animation for such 
chemistry concepts as two bonded 
moleeules oscillating. 

"Basically, what we try to do is 
to take a concept of chemistry or 
take a concept of quantum me-
chanics and make them visual ~o

ing about," he said.

CHEMISTRY: 
New. technology 
used in lectures 
Continued from ..... 9 

Wilson originally decided to 
bring this multi-media approach 
into the classroom because it 
proved successful in past presen-
tations he has made in cities such 
as Paris, Geneva and Quebec. 

"[My talks] were well-received 
and I thought I would try and ap-
ply [the same techniques] toteach-
ing," Wilson said. 

Wilson applied this approach to 
en liven lectures. He wanted to see if 
the multi-media presentations would 
help his students learn and retain 

information better. 
To that end, the multi-media 

presentations in a classroom envi-
ronment are a test to see whatworks 
and what needs to be !hanged for 
future lectures, according to Wil-
SOIl. "It is an experiment to see how 
it is received, " he added. 
Do ItucIenta like It? 

Without question, Wilson's 
Chemistry 127 lectures, which are 
held every Tuesday and Thursday 
at 8:30 a.m. inSolfs 104, are on the 
cutting edge of technology. But 
whether or not these methods are 
on the cutting edge of teaching 
remains to be decided: 

In the two weeks of class, stu-
dents have expressed mixed reac-
tions about the new approach. 

The UeSD Guardian 

"It is good at grabbing our at-
tention 8Ild I think people pay more 
attention," said Marshall College 
junior Juliana Setyawan, who 
added that the course was intellec-
tuall y stimulating compared to tra-
ditional lectures. 

But some students suggested 
that the same techniques that grab 
their attention also make it hard 
for them to keep up. 

"[Wilson is] a good lecturer, but 
I am skeptical [of the style]. It does 
not seem too serious. It might not 
work," said Revelle College senior 
Alex Rivkin, who added that he 
would prefer a straight lecture be-
cause the quick pace of the high-
tech lectures makes it difficult to 
ask questions. 

Willon acknowledged the pr0b-
lema usociated with going too 
fast. "That is the danger of a multi-
media presentation. I am not held 
back by writing on the chalk-
board," he said. 

"It is going to take some getting 
used to," said Warren College se-
nior Rod Howden. "There are some 
problems with format and at 8:30 
in the morning, people like to doze 
off." Howden added that Wilson 
seems to be "relying on it too much. 
He should use it as an aid, to aug-
ment instead of using it to teach 
the course entirely." . 

AImassizadeh said that he be-
lieves Wilson's method is effective 
in illustratingelabonneconcepts of 
chemistry. However, the method is 

Tuaday, Jaauary 18, 19M 

not yetcost-effec:tive. "Idon'tthink 
anyone else could be doina this 
because they don't have Kent', 
budget," said A1massizadeh. who 
added that as tedtnology improves 
in the next few years, the costs of 
such multi-media preaentations will 
decrease. When that happens, more 
lectures could be modeled after 
Chemistry 127. 

If the results of the new teaching 
method are favorable, Wiison may 
develop a presentation for Cliemis-

~ 6A and 6B students that visual-
izes quantum mechanics. Long-
range goals may even include syn-
dicating the multi-media presenta-
tion for use in other institutions. 

But for now, "We'll see how 
this goes," Wilson said.

UCSD Sprints By Field 
TOP'GUNS: Tritons make mincemeat of Division III rivals at Claremont Invitational 
By .,.. Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

Blasting into the Oaremont Col-
lege Invitational held at the 
Claremont-Mudd pool last Satur-

. day, both the 
men's and 
women's 
swimming 
teams knew 
they had 
something to 
prove . The 
Tritons had 
more than 
mere pride 
riding on the 
outcome. 
They wanted 

to prove beyond any shadow of a 
doubt that they were still the teams 
to beat in the competitive confer-
ence. 

UCSD had not had many oppor-
tunities to compete against fellow 
Division III rivals. San Diego'schal-
lenging schedule has been chock-
full of top Division I and II schools, 
producing a rather unimpressive 
record for the both of the Triton 
squads, but the eight Division III 
teams competing against the domi-
nating Tritons at Oaremont soon 
discovered that their record was far 
from indicative of their talent. 

"Our job was to make a state-
ment," Assistant Coach Rich 
Daniels said. "We had to let every-
one know why we are tbe favorites 
in the conference, and a favorite to 
win Nationals." 

The Tritons made a strong state-
ment, all right, with both the men 
and women demolishing their re-
spective eight-team fields. A num-
ber of swimmers won multiple 
events and established several pool 
records. 

\ 
Freshman Edward Ruth was one 

of the many Triton men to turn in a 
stellar performance. He iced first . 
place in the 200-yard individual 
medley (1M) and followed up the 
effort by capturing the gold in the 
longer 400-yard 1M event. 

Ruth 's lightning-quick times es-

tablish him as a serious contender 
for the conference finals in Febru-
ary. 

Senior John Flowers also made a 
big splash at the invitational. Like 
teammate Ruth, he gamered mul-
tiple first place finishes. 

Flowers conquered the field in 
the l00-yard butterfly and then pre-
sented an equally impressive encore 
performance in the IOO-yard 
freestyle. 

Not to be outdone, the UCSD 
women were equally dominant. 

Sophomore Carrie Parker had an 
excellent day, winning two events, 
including the lOO-yard backstroke, 
her best event. 

Freshman Heather McPherson 
was also a force to be reckoned 
with, taking first in two freestyle 
events. 

Both swimmers are serious con-
tenders in the co~erence in their 
respective events. 

Daniels was pleased with how 
the team swam at the Invitational. 

"For the most part, this meet was 
a workout for us, "Danielssaid. "We 
had a lot of people swim a lot of 
events for practice, and most per-
formed better than expected." 

The swimming team has its sights 
set on its last two meets before the 
Pacific Collegiate Conference Swim 
Championships, held on Feb. 17-19 
in Las Vegas. 

UCSD will continue its swim-
ming mastery at the Canyonview 
pool this weekend in the Industry 
Hills Swim Club competition, and 
finishes off its regular season at 
home against the University of 
Redlands on Sunday, Jan. 30. 

The women's NCAA Division 
III Championships will be held on 
March 10-12 in Williamstown, MA. 
The men's championships will take 
place the next weekend, March 17-

Men's Lacrosse Wins Consolation 
Finals at Mike Bradley Tournament 
ay~lll.r 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's lacrosse team 
continued its preseason on a posi-
tive note this weekend, winning two 
of its three matches at the Camp 
Pendleton-hosted Mike Bradley 
tournament. 

A late substitution for another 
club team which was unable to at-
tend, the rough-aod-tumble San Di-
ego squad made its presence known 
from the get-go. 

The first contest of the tourna-
ment proved the toughest for UCSD, 
who was matcbcd up apiraat one of 
tbe top club teams in San Diego, 
Yogi's. 

A1thouah it failed to come out on 
top, UCSD held its own venus 
Yogi '1,-08 by • respectable 15-7 
margin. 

"We could have played better, 
but the fact that we scored seven 
goals [against a team like Yogi's) is 
an accomplishment," senior de-
fender and co-captain Mark Steele 
said. 

San Diego'S second game on 
Saturday pitted the team against 
Beachcombers, another local club 
squad. In a tight game that was vir-
tually even the entire way ,tbe UCSD 
offense exploded when it needed to, 
nening three goals in tbe final two 
minutes. Senior Lee Carter's riHe 
shot past the defcnselcss 
8eacbcomer aetmindcr assured a 
14-12 victory. 

On Sunday, UCSD faced Haute 
Stilt, one of the more inexperienced 
club teamI in the tourDIIDeIIl. It 
IboMd. 

Led by the otfeasiw OIISIallJht 

of James Kappler, San Diego de-
molished its less-than-impressive 
opponent, 14-1. 

"Anything [Kappler) threw to-
ward the goal went in," Steele said. 
"He was absolutely amazing." 

All in all, it was definitely a posi-
tive weekend for UCSD, especially 
for goaltender Jerome Vial. 

"(Vial] was solid for us all tour-
nament long," Steele said. 

The tournament was held in 
honor of the late Major Mike Brad-
ley, who was an immensely positive 
inspiration &0 San Diego lacrosse. 
Bradley died recently in a helicop-
ter accident. 

UCSD begins its regular ~ason 
with a borne pme apiut Chapman 
University on Feb. 11.

Tritons Look To Improve 
SOFTBALL: UCSI;) lineup full of promise, potential after down season in 1993 
By BI.lr JohMOn 
Staff Writer 

While most UCSD students re-
laxed on the first day of the three-
day holiday weekend. the Triton 
softball team worked out some kinks. 

UCSD faced Point Lorna 
Nazarene College in a practice game 
o~ Saturday. The two teams dueled 
for nearly five hours, playing 100 
innings. with the home team com-
ing out ahead by Ihe score of22-] 3. 

In her second season, Manager 
Patricia Gerkens expects the Tri-
tons to improve on last season's 
rather dismal 6-28 record, and with 
this year's scrappy, more experi-
enced group, should have the confi-
dence and poise to win the close 
ones. 

"The team has more depth and 

experience over last year's squad." 
Ge~kens said. 

With only] 1 players i,l uniform 
for much of last season. the coach-
ing staff prayed for an injury-free 
off-season. 

But this year, with 15 players 
competing for an opening-day ros-
ter spot, Gerkens and her assistants 
can breathe a sigh of relief. 

Junior Lisa Gil should be the 
main offensive threat for the Tri-
tons, while senior Emily Rubin will 
be relied upon for experience and 
leadership. 

With most of the positions still 
up for grabs. the next four weeks of 
practice will be key for Gerkens and 
her staff. 

"There is no set lineup yet. Ev-
eryone will be getting a look at each

Also hoping to fill OUI the lineup 

after Gil and Rubin are outfielders 
April Williams and Kim Roenick, 
pitcher Christy McCauley. short-
stop Kelli Connelly and newcomers 
Chaundell Hopkins and Kristin 
Shueler. 

Hopkins hopes to garner a spot 
behind the plate as catcher or at 
shortstop, while the contact-hilling 
Schueler plans to fil in at first base. 

Looking to be more competitive 
this year. Gerkens expects other 
Division III schools such as 
laVerne and Cal Lutheran "to be 
UCSD's main rivals.

UCSD Spotty At La Verne 
ROAD LOSS: Tritons 
fall victim to yet another 
close one this time to the 
University of La Verne 
Leopards 70-67 
By Aron Miller 
ASSOCiate Sports Editor 

Somebody give them a break! 
The UCSD women's basketball 

• team has had 
..... ~I9lII~. Its share ot 

do wn-to-the-
wi re setbacks 
so far th is sea-
son. With a 
handful of re-
versed calls or 
just a couple 
of mis ed 
shots that de-
cided to fall 
in, the Tritons 
could easily 

have themselves a winning record. 
But somelimes that 's just the way 

the ball bounces. UCSD (6-8) took 
one on the chin right when it ap-
peared to have won the fight, this 
time against the University of La 
Verne (5-6), 70-67. 

The loss evened the Tritons' 
record versus t he Leopards at 1-1. 
Back on Dec. 3, UCSD beat La 
Verne, 66-57, at UCSD's Main 
Gym. Friday night, though, the Tri-
tons had to tangle with their Divi-
sion III rival on the road. And play-
ing on the road is never a very easy 
task. 

"La Verne has improved drasti-
cally si nce the last time we played 
them," UCSD Head Coach Judy 
Malone said. "And La Verne is a 
tough place to play." 

Not only did the Tritons have to 
co ntend with playing on the road in 
a hostile environment, but there were 
numerous technical distractions to 
compete agai nst as well. 

"I seriously considered forfeit-
ing the game before it even started," 
Malone admitted. "[La Verne] didn 'I 
have a running clock at the start of 
the game. After they finally got that 
fixed , the refereeing [during the 
game] wasn 't very good." 

During Ihe first half of the match, 
neither team would budge. Lisa 
Beaver would hit a turnaround five-
footer in the paint and the Leopards' 
Tiffany Hall , who led all scorers 
wilh 26 points, would bury a three-
pointer. Michelle Henricks would 
knock down an outside jumper, La 
Verne 's Rachell Auld would hit a 

GuIJfl1/1JIl FIle Photo 
Junior forward Taml Oviatt came off the bench to score eight 
points and grab seven rebounds In 7G-67 10 .. to La Verne. 
couple of free throws. 

After the first 20 minutes, the 
two squads were knotted at 36 
apiece. 

The second stanza was nearly a 
carbon copy ofthe initial half, with 
each team trading blow for blow. 

The Scoreboard 

UCSD 67 

LA VERNE 70 

As the clock whittled down , 
though, La Verne seemed to get 
hotter from the field, while UCSD 
began to miss shots that it had 
canned with ease before intermis-
sion. 

The Tritons had an opportunity 
to tie the game with a last-second 
three-pointer, but, like past games, 
the ball would not fall . 

When the buzzer sounded, the 
Tritons could pointto one area for 
blame: free throw shooting. While 

UCSD made only five of its 11 at-
tempts, the Leopards converted 18 
of27 freebies. La Verne also netted 
six three-point shots to the Tritons' 
two. Stats like that have haunted 
San Diego all year long. 

"Basically, we didn' t play very 
well. [La Verne] had some quick 
guards that we didn't defend very 
well," Malone said. 

Having already dropped eight 
games, the loss all but eliminated 
UCSD from playoff contention. 

"[The La Verne game] pr/ltty 
much ended any chance of us going 
to the playoffs," Malone said. "If we 
win the rest of our games we might 
have a slim chance." 

Henricks scored 18 points to lead 
UCSD. Beaver tallied 16 points and 
pulled down seven rebounds for the 
Tritons, while Tami Oviatt scored 
eight points and grabbed seven re-
bounds coming off the bench. 

"[Henricks] had the best game 
she's had inawbile, butwe didn 't do 
a good enough job getting the ba:tll"t""o-'" 
[Beaver]," Malone said. 

Rughy Falls To Old Aztecs 
SCRUMMAGE: UCSD loses preseason match, looks forward to regular season 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Guardian Reporter 

Despite battling unlil the final 
whistle and holding its own against 
its Divi ion II counterpart, the UCSD 
rugby team was edged out hy the 
Old Aztecs Club team, 34-31, on 
Saturday afternoon. 

The contest, however, did give 
UCSD a confidence boost heading 
into league play, which begins in 
two weeks. 

UCSD performed well and seems 
prepared to make a name for UCSD 
rugby. 

With a beady coaching staff, led 
by Head Coach Mult Benson, and 
young, hungry playen, UCSD is 

looking forward to league competi-
tion with high expectations. 

Forwards Devon Shea, Greg 
Hughes and Chris Wacker each 
played exceptionally well in the 
battle with the Old Aztecs and will 
all play essential roles in UCSD's 
5UCceSS this season. 

UC San Diego also received 
strong play from its back line, which 
gave the team much-needed depth 
and a solid all-around squad. 

The two teams engaged in a sec-
ond-side game as well on Saturday, 
which gave the younger UCSD play· 
en an opportunity to gain some valu-
able experience. 

The Old Aztecs came out on lop, 
.. ... .. __ , .. .... . • t ... 

19·15, despite strong UCSD perfor-
mances from Rig Jones and Tim 
Gifford. 

" It was a good learning experi-
ence," said Benson, who added that 
he was impressed with the way his 
younger playen performed and be-
lieves his squad is set for league 
play. 

With the added experience of 
game action finally under its collec-
tive bell, UCSD should be ready 10 
form a cohesive unit on its quest for 
I league championship. 

UC San Dieao will hit the road 
for the next two weekends before 
returning home for a leape match

L.A. HOOPS: 
Clippers should find a 
new city to play in 
ContInued from pace 20 
advanced no further than Ihe fir t 
round. This season was supposed 
to be the year the Clippers finally 
got over the hump to make a run 
at, in the very least, a second-
round playoff series. 

Meanwhile, the Lakers are, ad-
mittedly, in a rebuilding era. Wilh 
only an aging James Worthy re-
maining from that glorious decade 
past (and the recently resigned Kurt 
Rambis, of course), the team more 
resembles a really good college team 
than anything else. 

However, they do have a strong 
nucleus of young lalent - Nick 
Van Exel, Anthony Peeler, Vlade 
Divac (depending on which day of 
the week it is) and Doug Christie. 
Give them three years and the present 
Lakers will be contending for an-
other title. Laker General Manager 
Jerry West would have it no other 
way. They may be losing now, but 
the Lakers are still an organizalion 
full of pride and class.

Whal do Ihe Clippers hClve? 
Danny "I hale it here so trade me 
soon" Manning, Mark "I look like a 
moron when I do thai stupid dance" 
Jackson, Stanley " I have to run?" 
Roberts and Ron "Gi mme a whole 
lotta shots" Harper. 

What happened to all of those 
first-round draft picks? Danny Ferry : 
plays for Cleveland. Leron Ellis: 
took off for Charlotte. Don Maclean: 
producing in Washington. Randy 
Woods: who? 

The Cl ippers have played in the 
same run-down arena since they 
moved to L.A. At least clean the 
place up a bit! 

They've practically had a differ-
enl coach every season, and last 
season they had the gall to hire Ihe 
worst color commentator in history 
- Bill "Whal comes out of my 
moulh closely resembles wh at 
comes oUI of my butt" Walton. 

While the Lakers are headi ng for 
one their worst seasons in history, 
they can take solace in the fact that 
they will undoubtedly gcl a high 
lott ery pick. The Cl ippers, well 
we 've seen what they've done with 
their draft opportunities.

lown for Ihe two of 'em. The Lakers 
have promise. The Clippers have a 
guy on the suspended list for being 
too fat. The Lakers have the jerseys 
of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt 
Chamberlai n, Elgin Baylor, West, 
and Magic John on hanging from 
Ihe Forum walls. The Clippers have 
had one All-Star (Manning) since 
coming to L.A. 

No matter what the Clippers do, 
they will always play second fidd le 
to the Lakers. Regardless of wins 
and losses, the Lakers we re, are and 
will cont inue t~ be a more re peeled, 
more dignified and more successful 
baskelballteam. 

Heck, even this year, when Ihey 
were supposed to be so much worse 
off t han the CI i ppers, Ihe youngsters 
from Inglewood have won all three 
meetings between the two "rivals." 

Who knows why the Clippers 
moved from San Diego back in '83. 
And who know why they chose 
Los Angeles as their new home. II 's 
been 10 years and they've accom-
plished nOlhing. 

There are lots of cities to choose 
from across the counlry. Let's hope 
thatlhe Clippers pick one rcal soon 
and say good riddance.

Tritons Eclipse Century 
Mark With 101-71 Slugging 
SUMING: San Diego 
thrashes the visiting UC 
Santa Cruz Banana Slugs 
By Bre. K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

UCSD's men's basketball team 
extended its winning streak to seven 
games Saturday night with a 101-71 

BH5KET 

.~~ ."·4~· 
"". '.:' . 

BHLL 
season. 

salting of the 
visiting UC 
Santa Cruz 
Ban a na 
Slugs . The 
win upped 
the Tritons ' 
seasonal 
record to a 
barnburning 
13-3withjust 
nine contests 
remaining in 
the regular 

One of the major reasons for the 
Tritons' recent success, especially 
after the loss of Brian Van Noy 
(broken ankle), Kareem Matthews 
(academic ineligibility) and most 
recently freshman forward Evan 
Osmundson (broken finger), has 
been the emergence of 6'5" sopho-
more forward Khalil Allen. 

In what has become a thriving 
trend, Allen has scored the opening 
points for UCSD in all but one ofthe 
past eight victories, the exception 
being a 77-61 .win over Chapman 
University. 

The Tritons stuck to that win-
ning formula against UCSC, as once 
again Allen 's first-minute put-back 
off a Nate Hantgin miss initiated 
what has become a routine Santa 
Cruz slugging. 

The last time UCSC came to 
v isit , San Diego sent the team home 
in pieces after a 91 -38 shelling. This 
go-around, Santa Cruz regained 
some measure of respect by keeping 
the game relatively close. At least, 
that is, until the second half. 

Neither team looked very im-
pressive in the first few minutes, 
with both squads committing more 
turnovers than converting baskets, 
but finally Allen 's baseline drive 
past Santa Cruz forward David 
Goldberg put UCSD up 8-3 with 
] 5:58 left in the first half, forcing 
UCSC to call a time-out before this 
one got too ugly too quickly. 

UCSC's Ernie Bray responded 
by hitting three NBA-range three-
pointers, and Goldberg' s tip-in at 
7: 14 catapulted the Banana Slugs to 
a 28-27 lead. 

Then reality set in. Senior Erik 

YIIoow Z~/Gu.ai'" 
IenIor Ell« Johneon chipped In 
12 points In UCSD's victory. 

TII«IY ZOIotOfWY/GuItdl.wl 
Kahlll Allen finishes off two of his 20 points with • lIIOMter dunk. 

Johnson was quickly inserted into 
the Triton lineup and Bray saw less 
shooting daylight than a vampire. 

" A shooter understands a 
shooter," Johnson said. "I know ex-
actly where he wants to be and when 
he is going to do what he wants to 
do." 

The same couldn ' t be said for 
Bray, who allowed the " money-
man" Johnson to roam free past the 
arch. Johnson nailed three three-
pointers of his own, one of which 
was so deep he dialed in from the 
lost continent of Atlantis. 

Senior point guard Rodney 
Lusain also joined in the melee, 
picking the Slugs' pocket almost at 
will and dishing off to his Triton 
teammates, 

When not feeding Allen, 
Hantgin, Johnson or sophomore 
Matt Minnehan, Lusain was light-
ing it up from the outside, drilling 
three three-pointers to go along with 
his eight assists and eight steals. 

Santa Cruz couldn't sustain the 
lightning San Diego pace and fell 
behind 50-40 at the half. 

" We were a lillie embarrassed; 
we didn't play very hard in the first 
half," UCSD Head Coach Tom 
Marshall said. "We were a bit 
sloppy." 

San Diego' s defensive intensity 
picked up dramatically in the sec-
ond half and Lusian directed the 
offense with the confidence and 
poise of a Hall-of-Fame quarter-
back. 

UCSD stormed to a 58-40 lead 
behind Lusain' s three-point bank 
shot from tbe top of the key. Kevin 
Brown and Anthony Yannalla an-
swered for Santa Cruz. 

But when Lusain picked 
Yannatta 's pocket, flipped the ball 
downcourt to a streaking Hantgin, 
who in tum lofted a perfectly-placed 
ally-oop to a swooping Allen, that 
was all-she-wrote for tbe Slugs. 

Allen's theatrics increased the 
T ritons lead to 61-44 with 13:24 to 

play, and mercifully, Marshall 
started emptying his bench. 

"Our bench rotation has been 
very strong for us all year," Marshall 
said. "Stephano Bernasconi, Todd 
Benetar, Chris Ressa and Rick 
Mulloy came in and did a nice job." 

Nice job indeed. Benetar, who 
finished with nine points, sunk two 
straight outside jumpers, one a three-
pointer from the left baseline, to put 
UCSD up 79-56 with 7:23 left. 
Bernasconi collected four rebounds 
and four points and the senior Ressa 
caMed an open three-pointer to keep 
the Triton onslaught going. 

But starter Allen wasn ' t done by 
any stretch of the imagination. With 
6;00 remaining, Benetar'ssteal sent 
Allen streaking downcourt. Benetar 
lobbed a high arching pass toward 
the rim. Catching it in midflight, 
Allen rotated and jammed home a 
seemingly effortless reverse dunk 
over helpless Santa Cruz defender 
Gabriel Cage to make the stbte 84-
58. The Triton crowd roared and the 
Slugs wept. The nightmare only got 
worse. 

With Santa Cruz under full sub-
mission, UCSD turned its sights on 
breaking the tOO-point barrier. 

Needing four points in the wan-
ing seconds of the game, Mulloy 
pilfered an errant pass, drove the 
length of the court, was hacked in 
midair and somehow managed to 
kiss the ball off the glass. 

After Mulloy converted the three-
point play, UCSD forced a quick 
turnover with a mere eight seconds 
remaining, and UCSC immediately 
fouled Pat Pollock. 

The smallest member of the Tri-
tons canned both free throws, pUI-
ting UCSD over the century mark. 

"Win or lose, when all of your 
guys buy into a philosophy and play 
hard. it is fun to be a coach, " M arshall 
said. 

Allen finished with 20 points and 
six rebounds. Lusian put in 15 points, • 
while Minnehan had 13.

ARON 

MILLER 
L.A. Ain't Big 
Enough For 
Both of 'Em 

Tritons Place 15th at Tournament 
Taken a good look at the 

world of professional basket-
ball in Los Angeles recently? 
For the past couple of seasons 
the port has gone unnoticed in 
the City of Angel , and for 
good reason. 

As of this weekend, the 
Lakers (11 -24) trailed the 
Clippers (12-21) by two games, 
with the Sacramento Kings 
sandwiched between the two 
teams in a heated battle for the 
Pacific Division ba ement. 
Now that 's an inner-city 
rivalry. 

Despite the recent down-
pour of 10 es, Laker fa ns have 
plenty of reason to keep their 
chin up, at least compared to 
that other L.A. team. 

The Clipper have now been 
in Los Angeles for 10 years, 
and oh what a productive 
decade it has been. Who 
invited them, anyway? It 's not 
like the city was in dire need of 
any basketball aid back in 
1983. 

Let ' see. By then, the 
Lakers had captured their 
second championship of the 
decade and were well on their 
way to unveiling three more 
title banners high on the walls 
of The Fabulous Forum before 
1990. 

The last time anyone 
checked, the only things that 
could be seen in the colonnade 
section of the L.A. Sports 
Arena were rickety, dust-
ridden seats and a lonely 
peanut vendor named Frank. 

If you've never been to a 
Clippers game, stay at home. 
You ' ll save yourself the time 
and money of witnessing the 
most pathetic organization in 
the NBA, if not in all of pro 
sports. 

Sure, the men donning the 
cherry-red and blue uniforms 
have come a long way since 
the 12-70 days of the mid- 80s, 
when Benoit "Ben Jamin'" 
Benjamin developed that 
uncanny ability to foul out by 
halftime and "Stormin'" 
Norman Nixon (formerly a 
Laker) was finding new and 
exciting ways to tear his 
Achilles tendon. 

They managed to make the 
playoffs the last two seasons, a 
first for the franchise, but

UCSBINVITE:UCSD 
has strong preseason 
showing at prestigious UC 
Santa Barbara Collegiate 
Invitational Tournament 
By Dan Kraft 
Staff Writer 

The Triton men's volleyball team 
continued its preseason encounter 
with the best the nation has to offer 

last Friday 
and Saturday 
at the 30th An-
nual UC Santa 
Barbara Col-
legiate Invita-
tional Tourna-
ment. 

Th e Tri -
tons' road to 
success at the 
invitational 
was a rocky 
one at the out-
set. UCSD 

opened the prestigious invitational 
on Friday pitted against national 
power BYU. 

The overmatched UCSD squad 
fell to the nation's second-ranked 
team from ?rovo with the Cougars 
downing the Tritons by a score of 
15-6, 15-9. 

In its second match of the day, 
the San Diego contingent was beaten 
by tournament surprise UC Berke-
ley -15-6,16-14. 

"We were disappointed at the 
time [with the loss to Berkeley]," 
fifth-year senior Steve Kremser said. 
"But Cal played well. They sur-
prised a lot of people." 

After the tough start, UCSD 
turned the tide, spiking Westmont 
by scores of 15-7 and 15-11. 

As a result of the losses to BYU 
and Cal and the victory over 
Westmont, the Tritons earned a spot 
in Pool III of the four-pool tourna-
men!. 

With ever-increasing momen-
tum, the Tritons defeated Colorado 
(15-12, 15-9)and stomped UCSanta 
Cruz (15-8, 15-5) to round out 
Friday's play. 

"We've got a very positive atti-
tude," Kremser said. "It's the most 
positive the team has been in the 
five years I've been playing." 

Going into Saturday's action, 
UCSD was on a three-match win-
ning streak and Menlo was unable 
to put a dent in the Tritons' confi-
dence. 

The 15-10, 15-7 victory over 
Menlo set up a showdown with the

Sun Devils of Arizona State. 
In a tough three-set match, the 

Sun Devils managed to cool off the 
red-hot Tritons, winning by scores 
of 15-9,10-15, and 15-10. 

The loss sent the Tritons to the 
15th-place game against UC Davis. 
UCSD was not to be denied in its 
shot at placing among the nation's 
best, playing a solid match to defeat 
the Aggies (15-12,7-15,15-10 and 
15-8). 

The tournament was a chance for 

the Tritons to get to know one an-
other and to improve their game for 
the start of the upcoming year. 

UCSD's first regular season 
match will be away against Cal State 
Northridge on Saturday, Jan. 22. 

The home opener for the Tritons 
will be on Tuesday, Jan. 25 against 
Princeton University.

The Tritons played the national 
championship contenders tough, 
capturing a game off of the Gauchos 
and forcing the match to go four 
sets. Eventually UCS8 triumphed 
15-3,15-10,8-15,15-8. 

Kerr led the Tritons in every posi-
tive category, pounding home 16 
kills (including a .518 hitting per-
centage), six digs, two solo blocks, 
two block assists and committing 
only two errors. 

GUARDIAN ATHLETE-OF-THE-WEEK 

Senior Tyson Kerr proved this weekend why he is a force to 
be reckoned with in the upcoming Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation season. 

At the UC Santa Barbara Invitational, Kerr led the Tritons to 
a 5-3 record during the two-day event. Against fifth-ranked 
UCSB, the outside hitter tallied 16 kills while committing a mere 
two errors for an astounding .518 hitting percentage. 

"[Kerr) can definjtely play with the competition in this 
league," UCSD Head Coach Doug Dannevik said.
