Wha~ever happened to LUlDuDiba Zapata College? 

They never Jail who die 
in a great cause: the block may soak 

their gore; 
Their heuds may sodden in the sun; 

their limbs 
Be strung to city gates and castle 

walls-
But still their spint walk abroad. 

-BYRON, Marino Faliero, II 

By MATTHEW j. CRONIN 

T HIS reflection of Lord • Byron's captures the essence of the "Back to 
the Basics" program given by 

Third College students, alumni, 
and faculty members last 
Monday. The program was set up 
in commeration of the history 
and ideals of Third College's 
parent structure, Lumumba-
Zapata College, which was 
achieved in 1969 by students 
from the Black Student Council 
(BSC) and the Mexican-American 
Youth Asso iation (MAYA) in an 
attempt to give minority students 
at UCSD an opportunity to 
develop for themselves an 
educational curriculum that best 
suited their individual and 
collective needs and desires. 

Lumumba-Zapata College was 
governed by a broad coalition of 
progressive students, staff and 
faculty members under a General 
Assembly, (comprised entirely of 
students), and a board of 
Directors, (made up of all three 
groups), until 1972, when the 
UCSD Administration, according 
to Professor of Spanish Literature 
Carlos Blan~o, ·couldn't handle 
the idea of negotiating with a 
collective structure, so it 
attempted (successfully) to 
impose a heirarchy upon the 
College." 

The collective structure of the 
Lumumba-Zapara government -
where all interested students met 
in a General Assembly for hours 
upon end in order to reach 
decisions by consensus -
elected Board of Directors up 
until that time in spring of 72 
when Provost Joseph Watson , at 
the heed of then Chancellor 
McElroy, and under heavy 
pressure from 'rhe San Diego 
establishment, began .violaring 
and vetoing rhe L-l goveming 
harter. According to Blar.tQ and 

Vin cDebaca, presently a UC D 

e Watson's alcohol 
memorandum

meeting.

graduate student and one of the 
founders of L-Z College , "the 
decisions made by students, 
which concerned all facts of 
college life , such as admi sion , 
recruitment, retention , 
curri ulum, and rhe like, were , 
on the whole , excellent ones. -
This sentiment· was also echoed 
by Professor of African HistOry, 
Edward Reynolds, who aid , 
"when I came here in 1971 
students were really concerned 
abour rhe welfare of other 
student , and their participation 
in the deciSion-making process 
of L-Z College proved that." But, 
according to Debaca. the UC D 
administration , the San Diego 
establishment (such as the San 
Diego Union). and even right-
wing intellectual columnists such 
a Rowland Evans and Robert 
Novak, "branded our truggle for 
ethnic freedom and ethnic 
equality, liberation and self-
determination as communistic . 
They called us radical militants." 

There were four central 
demands that originated from 
the Lumumba-Zapata movement, 
and which eventually 
materialized into some of the 
present core theme of Third 

allege - along WIth their 
omnipresent struggle for 
liberation and clf-determlnJtion 
- from whom the), ho e a

nauonalism and separatism 
Patrice Lumumba - the L-Z 
movement demanded rhat the 
college be made up of at least 
[Wo-thirds minority students, and 
one-third poor and working-class 
whires. There was to be a special 
emphaSiS on re ruiting 
marginalized high school 
srudents who did not fit the UC 
Regents rigid randards for 
admission , and a core 
curriculum that would include 
compulsory courses in Third 
World tudies that featured such 
negIe ted topics as the effects of 
We tern colonialism and 
Imperialism on ThIrd World 
nations, the socio-cultural growth 
of minority cultures In rhe 
United tates. and the teachings 
of Third World scholars and 
theorericians, Urban and Rural 
Studies (be ause so many 
minoriry students do nor grow 
up in suburbia). 
Communication . (because of the 
incresing control ,and 
manipulation of Information 
resources). and 5 ience and 
Te hnology, (be ause of it 
accclcrdted prescn e in national 
culture.) 

Their se ond demand was (hat 
UC 0 a tively rc rult ml norit)1 
scholars for tea hing po ltIons at 
L-Z College, as. saId Blan . "it 
wa pretty obvious that non-
marginahzed people would not 
be teaching the atrociou effe t 
of U .. dominant Ideology upon 
ThIrd World pc pic and 
nation .. " Reynold lidded , "If It 
V .l not for the L-Z movement 1 

mIght not be here today." 
Concerning the curriculum that 
was established at L-Z College, 
Reynolds said , ·We believed , and 
till do believe. that learning 

should not be divorced from the 
ocial imperatives of our time. L-

Z College did not just want to 
mainstream students intu the 
dominant Anglo-Saxon history of 
thought and action as they do in 
Revelle humanities sequence." 

The third and fourth demands 
of the L-Z movement were very 
much intertwined. These 
demands addressed the issue of 
who would control the new 
Third College, and what type of 
governance would be established . 
As stated briefly before , L-Z 
College ended up being 
governed by a General Assembly 
of students, who referred their 
decisions to a Board of Director 
comprised equally of students, 
faculty , and taff who were 
freely elected), who then passed 
on thei r decision to the 
admini tration , which , for a 
short time inacted the decision 
mto policy. The Provost at the 
time, Dr. Joseph Warson, wa 
supposed to have no 
independent authority from the 
Board. 

In 1909, the Lumumba-Zapata 
movement a hieved their dream 
of having their own college. 
which they thought they would 
take far Into the future . They had 
only been 30 in number when 
they began their trugglc for self-

Japan summer 
program offered 

University of Cahfornia 
students will have an opportunity 
to study in Tokyo , japan, this 
summer through a newly 
established program at Sophia 
Universiry. 

The five-week session is 
scheduled for July 13-August IS , 
and is open to studems from all 
Universiry of Califorr .a 
campuses. 

Since World War .1, the 
economic and geopolitical ties 
between the United States and 
japan have continued to grow to 
the point where the twO 
countries are now intimately 
interlinked in a global 
relationship that is both 
competitive and cooperative, 
according to Daniel Wick, 
director of Summer Sessions at 
the University of California, 
Davis. Because the ties between 
the United States and Japan are 
likely to grow even stronger, it 
has become increasingly 
important for Americans to 
improve our understanding of 
the people and culture of this 
co mplex civili1.ation . 

BLOOM COUNTY 

The program include a four-
unit course on labor and 
management m modern Japan, 
taught by Earl Kmmonth , UCD 
associate professor of history; an 
additional four-unit course to be 
selected from Sophia University's 
offering in Japanese language, 
art, literature , religion and 
history. Lectu re s will be 
supplemented by factory Visits 
and walking tours of industrial 
and commercial areas in Tokyo 
and vlcmity. 

Kinmonth 's course will 
emphasize employment relations 
in modem and pre-World War (( 
Japan . The course will take 
students from scratch, with no 
prereqUisites required. 

The Sophia University 
program is the second new 
initiative In the Pacific Rim. A 
summer program in Kunming, 
China, was announced in 
November and will offer UC 
students five weeks of study at 
Yunnan University and the 
Yunnan Institute of Technology. 

Both programs are responses 
to UC President David Gardner's 
call for educational and research 
programs in the Pacific Rim. 

For more infonnation on 
either program, UC students 
should contact Summer Sessions,

UCSA supports 
a number of new 
legislative policies 
By RENEE ALISON, UC /)(jvis 

SACRAMENTO - State efforts to increase the California 
minimum wage, simplify financial aid forms and prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual orientation have won suppOrt from 
the University of California Student Association . 

The Association strongly supports Assembly Bill 120 by 
Assemblymember Rick Aoyd, D-Los Angeles, which raises 
California's minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.50, said Kirk Knutsen, 
UCSA director for legislative affairs. 

If the state required the university to pay students more, financial 
aid shortcomings and surprise wage cuts like those that happened 
at UC Berkeley and UC Riverside this summer would not be as 
much of a problem for students, said Knutsen , who believes that it is 
difficult to pay for students relying on financial aid and a minimum . 
wage job to finance their education . 

"This would solve a lot of problems right off the bat," Knutsen 
said. "It would crank up wages at quite a few campuses." 

"Bread and butter issues," like 'simplifying the financial aid 
procedure, also have UCSA's support, Knutsen said. 

The California Student Aid Commission is drafting a proposed 
bill that would make state financial aid residency requirements 
match the federal government's, he said. UCSA will not offiCially 
support the draft proposal until it is introduced into the legislature, 
he said, but "at this stage, it looks good ." 

The current financial aid application process "is a doozy 
guaranteed to cause headaches: Knutsen said, because the state 
and federal governments have different regulations. 

"I reaUy pity financial aid directors" who must deal with aU ' the 
paperwork, he said . 

UCSA also supports "the everpresent AB1: a bill by 
Assemblymember Art Agnos that prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation. 

Agnos, D-San Francisco, has introduced the bill for several years 
running, only to see it vetoed by Gov. Deukmejian follOwing intense 
criticism from conservative religious groups. _ 

"Even if you ignored the fact that approXimately 10 percent of the 
universities 145,000 students are gay or lesbian," Knutsen said, 
UCSA would support the measure because "our view is that 
supporting equal rights is a social responsibility." 

Several other "perennial issues: like AlDS research and bill 's 
protecting a woman's rights to an abortion will also continue to get 
UCSA support, he said. 

"Even ifUC students have a magic immunity to AlDS, we will still 
support bills to combat it It's a social responsibility," Knutsen

Administration opposes trolley thm UCSD 
By ERIC CHAlANKIN 

A controversy has developcd between UCSD officials and city planning 
agencies over the route which 
the San Diego Trolley will take 
when it arrives here someti me in 
the 1990s. The proposed 
routings, or "alignments," were 
the main topic of discussion at a 
recent meeting of the board of 
di rectors of the San Diego 
Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board (MTDB). 

The controversy centers 
around three different proposed 
alignments of the trolley as it 
traverses the UCSD campus. The 
alignments favored by the UC 
administration, and 
recommended by a San Diego 
Association of Governments 
(SanDAG) advisory committee, 
runs along the route of interstate 
highway five, traversing the as 
yet largely undeveloped eastern 
portion of the campus. 

William Lieberman, MTDB 
director of planning, said that 
the staff there favors a "central 
campus" alignment, passing near 
the current bookstore and the 
central library. The UCSD 
administration has consistently 
opposed this route. 

Judy Leitner of MTDB's public 
relations depattment stated that 
a third alignment under 
consideration , to run along 
Regent'S Road (in University 
City) was the board's second 
choice, with the 1-5 alignment 
coming in third , 

Two days before the January 8 
meeting, a recommendation by a 

SanDAG advisory committee In 
favor of the 1-5 alignment was 
c hanged by the staff of the 
MTDB to recommend the central 
campus route . George Franck, 
Senior Transportation Planner for 
SanDAG, said the committee had 
a recommendation "that was 
different from the one made by 
MTDB staff." 

Questions have been raised 
about the urliversity's influence 
on the SanDAG committee's 
findings . According to UCSD 
community campus planner Mary 
Grana, the UCSD representative 
on the SanDAG committee was 
Pat Collum, wh o formerly held 
Grana's position . SanDAG's 
Franck stated that, "largely 
because of Pat's comments , an 
alignment through the campus, 
like the one recommended by 
MTDB staff, was eliminated." 

The MTDB's Lieberman said 
that the current lack of 
population around the 1-5 
alignment, along with a relatively 
high projected cost, made it 
much less desirable than the 
central campus route; "We had 
to pick one thing to be close to ," 
he said . A SanDAG study dated 
December 1986 shows a large 
and increasing number of trips 
to and from UCSD. It futther 
states that, "approximately 80 
percent of the trips will occur on 
the main portion of campus, 
between North Torrey Pines 
Road and 1-5." 

Lieberman estimated the costs 
of the three alignments at $150 
million for 1-5; $83 million for 
central UCSD. and $65 million 

for Regent'S Road. 
The UCSD admini stration has 

VOIced several objections to the 
central campus alignment , 
including a lctter from UCSD 
Chancellor Ricahrd Atkinson 
supporting a routing different 
from onc which a San Diego 
Association of Governments 
(SanDAG) survey shows 75 
percent of UCSD associates 
suppott . 

UCSD's Grana stressed that 
adequate stud ies of the cost~ and 
impacts of the different 
alignments has not yet been 
completed. According 10 Grana , 
by the time the trolley line IS 
complete, the area around the 1-5 
alignment will be much more 
highly developed than at present. 

Also , the university does not 
want thc" "disruption" of a trolley 
system running though the heart 
of campus, says Grana . However, 
the MTDB's Lieberman said that 
a "mole-like" machine could be 
used to tunnel deep under the 
campus for mos t of the route , 
eliminating many of the 
problems associated with an 
above-ground system. 

When asked about the 
underground alternative, Grana 
had twO main objections; that an 
underground station could 
become crime-ridden, and that 
sensitive instruments such as 
electron microscope~ housed in 
central campus buildings would 
be adversely affected by any 
trolley system running near them. 
Lieberman said that he had 
heard these objections, and had 

thought that most of them could 
be workcd out. 

The administration also 
objects to a proposed extension 
or "spur" track out to the 
UniverSity Town Center area, 
which would originate at a 
UCSD station . This is currently 
an element of each of the three 
possiblc alignments. Grana 
Explained that the universlry was 
not appropriate place for a spur 
track, which could bring non-
students on campus. 

Regarding relative COStS, Grana 
said that SanDAG had given her 
cost figure of ~146.9 million for 
the 1-5 alignment , and ~151.6 
million for the central campus 
route (each of these was 
incuding the cost of the eastern 
spur track). These figures differ 
significantly from the MTDB 
estimates of Lieberman. 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, in a letter dated July 3, 
1986, and addressed to james R. 
Mills, the Chairman of the 
MTDB, wrote that the university 
supported thc proposal to bring 
the light rail (trolley) system onto 
campus, and was "especially 
pos itive about the prospects of 
developing a station along the I-
S corridor." No mention was 
made of the central campus 
alignment. 

Regarding the proposed spur 
track, Atkinson opposed this 
idea on the grounds that it was 
"consistent neither with UCSD's 
specific land use plans ... nor 
with our overall programmatic 
objectives. I recommend that 

MTDB pursue other possibilities 
for the spur." 

According 10 a SanDAG 
document dated December, 
1986, a survey conducted in 
October o f that year by SanDAG 
included 245 respondents 
associated with UCSD, of which 
152 were undergraduates. Over 
60 percent of those surveyed 
"indlcatcd that they would be 
able (Q walk to their campus 
dcsti nation from a station at 1- 5 
near the VA hospital." 

However, the survey also 
found that " ... 74 percent of the 

. univcrsity respondents ~ould 
prefer a station close to the 
existing campus bookstore." It 

\.\.o~nt on to say that, "More than 
70 percent of the respndents felt 
they would use the trolley 
between campus and the 
Universtiy Town Center area if 
this service was provided, with 
undergraduates indicating the 
highest pmcntial ridership." 

Despite these finding, the 
uni versity has not changed its 
stance on the Issue, arguing that 
some of thc findings may be 
misleading. In a letter dated 
January 8, 1987, and addressed 
to the MTDB board, Assistant 
Vice Chancellor for University 
Relations Bruce Darling states 
that UC'iD " ... strongly opposes 
the we~[ campus alignment as 
recommended by MTDB staff." 

Darling argues that polls of 
present university associates 
"would tend to prod lice opinions 
based on existing conditiO.Jjs,"

4 Thlmday. Ja nuary 29. 1987 

The limits of submissive compliance 
Nobody would deny the 

fact that history ha a 
tendency to repeat itself. uch 
instances are not necessarily 
the product of people 
modeling their present after 
the past. Realistically, the 
conditions under which 
political events occur, appear 
in a cyclical fashion . 

UCSD has remained 
relatively quiet over the past 
year. Throughout 1985 there 
had been some turmoil over 
the trouncing of student 
liberties and self-
determination by the powers 
that be. tudents were 
extremely active in protesting 
UC investment in aparrheid , 
the repression of free speech 
rights here at UCSD, the 
condi tions that promoted a 
rash of suiCIdes on our 
campus, and the 
administrative manipulation 
of the elecrion bylaws 
surrounding the University 
Center. 

Unfortunately, the relative 
amount of success secured by 
students succeeded in 
sedating our growing 
awareness that persistence is 

a necessity in establishing an 
active role in the governance 
of this university. The 
administration h as taken the 
cue In 1986 and restored 
their iron-fisted autocracy, 
hoping to accomplish for 
themselves as much as 
possible before the 
commencement of the next 
storm. Fees have been hiked , 
alco hol consumption h as been 
restricted, and s tudent 
parking has increased in cost 

and decreased in capacity . 
Taking the gauntlet a bit 

furt he r than those students 
and faculty members who 
discussed the reinstatement of 
a student general assembly 
and board of directors similar 
to that in the time of 
Lumumba-Zapata College 
(now know as Third College ), 
we would say that the trial 
period for the Associated 
Stude nt Co un cil is neari ng its 
end. Although many o f the 

individuals who participated 
in the Council Sincerely s trove 
to improve the plight of 
UCSO's s tudents , they we re 
suppressed by the Council's 
political structure. The 
counc il , regardless of its good 
intentions, has degenerated 
into a powerless advisory 
b oard whose main function is 
to funnel student protest into 
the monolithic bureaucracy. 
The council's powers are 
limited to distributing student 

funds to various organizations 
and to petitioning for the 
redress o f grievances. The AS 
was purposely engineered this 
way after the demise of 
Lumumba-Zapata in order to 
restore the complete authority 
of the Administration who has 
proven thus far, to be a 
malevolent and undemocratic 
higher power. 

The forseeable future will 
bring one of twO events. The 
administration will sense the 
growing anger among the 
numerous concerned students 
and loose n its grip on student 
freedom and self-
determination in hopes that 
we will once again pick up . 
o ur books and continue 
sch o lastically in a somewhat 
less repressive environment , 
or th ey will continue in their 
present directio n with hopes 
that the student body will be 
intimidated by the official 
monster and back down, with 
a feeling of conditioned 
h elplessness. The \a~ter didn't 
work in Iran , Nicaragua, 
France, or the United States. 
It most likely will not work at 
UCSO either. ~

Convention time 
Editor: 

Do you agree that we need 
a new kind of student 
govemment, one actually capable 
of defending our interests as 
students from the increasingly 
arrogant and dictatorial 
university administration? If so, 
you're not alone . In order to 
make needed changes In the 
structure o f the AsSOCiated 
Student (AS.) government , a 
group of students has formed to 
brmg about a constitutional 
convention. We feel that the 
current AS. government structure 
IS undemocrallc, and thus an 
madequate instrument of the 
students' will, for the followi ng 
reasons: 

1) Lack of proponional 
representation is undemocratic. 

Under the current system, a 
slate often gets around 40 
percent of the vote, but none of 
the council scats , leaVing nearly 
half the student body without 
representation on the A.S. 
Council. Third World students in 
particular are consistently denied 
representation In the student 
government. Entire sectors of the 
student body are ahenated from 
"their" government , which has 
thus become Isolated and 
vulnerable to manipulation by 
the admInistration . At best, such 
a government i!, utterly worthless 
to us . 

2)Lack of opponuniry for 
student participation in A.S. 
Council proceedings is 
undemocratic. 

Currently, the A.S. Council 
"lets" students participate In only 
the first IIfteen minutes o f 
discussion , after which they may 
speak only if a council member 
chooses to recognize them. If 

twenty students show up for a 
meeting, this works out to forry-
five seconds each. While thiS 
might be adequate lor a Pepsi 
commercial, ideas of greater 
complexity usually escape 
consideration 

3)Denial of students ' right to 
vote in A.S. elections is 
undemocratic, 

Elections are currently held so 
early In the spri ng quarter that 
the registrar can't supply election 
offiCials with a complete Ii t of 
all the ehglble votel s. Cople of 
the incomplete list arc kept at 
the polls , and if you aren't on 
that list, you aren't allowed to 
vote. LaSt year, this resulted In 
about 1000 students being 
denied the right to vote in the 
elections. 

.. )lgnoring student referenda is 
undemocratic, 

Students can get measures 
placed q'n the ballot by collectJ ng 
signatu{es, but the student 
government is under no 
obligation to honor the outcome 
of our votes on those measures 
under the present scheme. As 
the clearest expressIOn of our 
collective Wishes, votes on 
student-sponsored referenda 
;hould expliuty be made 
binding. 

S) Politically motivated budget 
cuts are undemocratic. 

Past and present AS. CounCils 
have often cut , or threatened to 
cut, the fundIng of student 
organizations whose views they 
dislike or deem "unimportant." 
The commlltee for World 
Democracy falm !ocne and the 
Peoples ' Vwce , UCSD's Afncan-
Amencan newspaper, are twO 
examples. The new constitution 
should expressly affirm the f'lr:;t 

Amendment rights of student 
media , political and cultural 
organ izations. 

I 
In order to bnng about a 

consitiutional convention, we 
need to get 15 percent of the 
student body to sign a petition 
to thiS effect. Within tv:elve days 
of the petition's completion, the 
convention must begin , and all 
students attendIng may 
participate in the discussions 
and voting. We will have until 
the beginning of the convention 
to complete a draft of the new 
constitution , and we must have 
your Input in writing it. To 
successfully create a new, more 
democratic form of student 
governmem, we will need the 
vigorous and enthusiastic 
participation of all i ndivicjuals 
and groups on our campus. This 
is no triVial issue : control over 
our struggles with the university 
administration, and over 
$500,000 in campus actiVity fees, 
is at Stake. We need a broadly 
representative body, accountable 
to all of us, With the power 
flowing from the active suppOrt 
of thousands of stude nts. 
Towards this end , we hope that 
you will help us to take full 

advantage of the opportunity 
which awaits us.

Subject A Flaws 
Editor: 

I was really glad to see that the 
Guardian focused its anention on 
th e troubled Subject A program 
in the January 8 issue and gave 
it the anention it deserved -
the front page . .J 

I am a freshman at UCSD and 
am one of the unfortunates who 
was required to take a quarter of 
Subject A I believe that some 
sort of program should be 
required to bring everyone up to 
UCSD standards, but the current 
Subject A program is not the 
answer. 

The people in my class 
consisted primarily of three 
groups: people who speak 
English as a second language, 
people who had a lousy English 
background and people who 
needed brushing up on their 
writing style . UCSD should have 
three different college prep 
classes geared toward each of 
t h ese groups, instead of having a 
class that only benefits a small 
portion of the class. Subject A's 
supposed purpose is to prepare 
the incqming students that need 
help so that they may be more 
productive with their use of 
English. Subject A is not fulfilling 
thiS purpose. 

The course has many 
structural flaws. First, I can't 
understand why Subject A is a 
non-credit course , as it meets 
twice a week with a total of five 
hours; on the other hand, a four 
unit lecture normally only has a 
total of four hours per week of 
class. Second, Subject A has a 
mandatory anendance rule; one 

cannot be absent more than twO 
times in the quarrer. Regular 
lectures do not have attendance 
requirements. Third, unlike a 0.5 
unit P.E. course, I did have 
homework in my Subject A class. 
Lastly, along with receiving no 
units, you are not even given a 
grade in the course . 

I feel sorry for the incoming 
freshmen who will have to take · 
this remedial course that doesn't 
fulfill its purpose.

Keep the trees 
Editor: 

Congratulati ons to EV1 Wong 
for \\<riting a timely and complete 
article that has pinpointed a 
temble dilemma this campus 
presently faces - preservation of 
trees VS. raisi ng of buildings. 

It is almost undeniable that 
progress and development is 
necessary on this campus in 
order to meet the needs of a 
growing population . I trust the 
Open Space Master Plan Task 
Force will succeed in reaffirmi ng 
the need to preselve the ever-
dWindling natural reserves on 
campus wh ile realizing the need 
to enlarge the physical plant. 

But personally, I'd much rather 
keep the trees.

beverage companies. Those copies of Watson 's memorandum 
receiving Watson 's letter have and the AS's policy on TG 
been asked to forward their 
responses to Dr. John Giebink, 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Development. 

The ASAC is acting as "the 
main forum" for discussion 
according to Giebink. The 
comminee consists of several 
student representatives, 
university administrators and 
staff members. Dr. Sara Arroyo, of 
Psychological Services, acts as 
chairperson . 

Concern expressed Monday 
stems from the committee's

Varied comments were 

expressed on the present state of

everything is as smooth as we

Further he believes the UCSD 
police department is "hands off' 
in their handling of ID checks of 
suspected underage drinkers. 

Randy Woodard believes 
enforcement of the legal drinking 
age, and overall control at TG's 
has greatly improved in recent 
years. He contends students do 
look for "loopholes" in the 
system requiring colored 

wristbands to distinguish those 
who are 21 from those underage . 
but he believes the AS is working 
to "close those loopholes."

Some members in anendance 
expressed concern that Watson 
has already made a decision on 
the issues noted in his

UCSD's Darling also reiterates 

concerns about trolley vibrations 
hampering the operation of 
sensitive instuments, and . 
continues the theme of 
oppostition to a spur line. " . .. we 
do not believe that crossing the 
campus to serve communiry 
retail and office facilities is . 
appropriate to the environment 
of an educational institution." 
states Darling's letter. 

The MTDB's Liebern'lan 
continues to hold out some hope 
for th e central campus alignment, 
however, and said that it would 
like to work with UCSD to iron 
out the problems with the route. 
"We have looked at other 
universities with rail transit, and 
found that they are well served: 
he said , citing as an example the 
Universiry of Alberta at 
Edmonton. 

The latest move by the MTDB 
board is only a step in what has 
been called a process of 
elimination. "These are the ones 
whic h appear the most feasible 
now: said Lieberman of the 
three alignments, saying that 
many things could still change. 
The system is not projected to 
reach the UCSD campus until 
sometime between 1995 and 
2005. i:J

Roaches can bring home the bacon 
By TAMARA HICKS 

Y OU have put out the roach motels, sprayed every visible inch and 
unmercifully squashed the 
annoying bugs to their death. 
Chances are your attempts were 
unsuccessful-the cockroaches are 
back and here to stay. 

This invasion of cockroaches 
is occurring on college campuses 
across the nation. They are even 
infesting T-shirts and nOlepads, 
crawling across sweatsuits and 
bed sheets and popping up on 
posters and decals. Face it, these 
little creatures are here to stay. 

Cockroaches? Adorable? The 
concept of roaches following in 
the footsteps of thousands of 
alligators could make a bundle 
for its creator, Susan Wonderly. 
However, this Massachusetts 

. entrepreneur won't be the only 
roach lover benefiting from the 
new craze. She is providing a 
comfonable way for enterpnsing 
college students to supplement 
tuition costs. 

The Roach Ware product line 
features aloischus (pronounced 
al-o-WISH-us), which means of 
noble birth and readiness. "It 
always appears in bold lower 

case letters because after all , I am 
a bold lower case bug!" aloischus 
says of himself in his brochure. 

"aloischus has taken off like 
wild fire," said Wonderly. The 
business, in two months, has 
surpassed projections by 
approximately 1,800 percent. 
"Public reaction to Roach Ware 
has been astounding, at times 
overwhelming, she continued. 
"It's incredible. Our product isn't 
sexy, nor are we flashy or slick. 
We're doing everything simply 
"in-house." ' 

Last July, Wonderuly was 
feeling frustrated by the 
bureaucratic red tape and 
concerned that human -service 
programs were not accomplishing 
all that they could for people 
truly in need. Walking down 
Massachusetts Avenue on a cold 
and blistery snowy day shortly 
after Thanksgiving,' she saw 
many elderly people scantily 
dressed and shivering, some 
women in sandals and barefeet. 
"All I could think of was that 
some people are literally freezing 
while may of us, not as 
concerned with absolute 
essentials, take time searching 
for and spending money on 

Name thatDJ. 

By VALERIE TIANO 

H AVE you ever been listening to the radio when the disc jockey 
says "Give us a call here at. .. ?" 

One day last September, I felt 
compelled to call. I just wanted 
to see if I really would get 
through and also wanted some 
information on the Labor Day 
festivities happening here in San 
Diego. 

I dialed the number expecting 
the circuit to be busy. I also 
thought it would be next year's 
Labor Day when I'd finally get 
through. After several rings, the 
voice that usually reached me via 
the radio was reaching me via 
my telephone receiver. I was 
surprised to hear this familiar 
voice. The disc jockey on the air 
was actually answering the 
phone lines! 

We talked for a few. minutes, 

and then the song was ending so' 
we ended our conversation . This 
became my newest pastime -
"call the station , and talk about 
more than Just a song." During 
one call, the DJ. and I had a 
personal conversation, and when 
the songs ended, he just put me 
on hold. This changed my whole 
perspective on DJ.s as well as 
radio stations themselves. 

So I tried it again . I dialed the 
number ... the phone rang and 
was answered by a deep, 
enthusiastic, yet unfamiliar male 
voice. We began talking, and the 
converstion continued for about 
ten minutes - ten minutes is a 
long time, conSidering he was on 
the air . 

I mentioned that) was a 
UCSD student and wanted to 
write a story for the GuardIan . 
He liked the idea, but no formal 

items like polo shins with 'the 
"in" emblems: Wonderly 
commented. "Cockroaches 
should be on those shirts, not 
alligators or polo ponies," was 
her reaction. The sketch was the 
result. Her design became the 
perfect anti-label statement. 

The number of opponunities 
for students to get involved with 
the product are abundant. 
Student Campus Representatives 
(Roachlings) can earn an average 
income of $100-$500 in 3 to 15 
hours a -week. For example, an 
average profit on aT-shin is 
$5.50. Selling six T-shins an 
hour brings in $33. Ac.cording to 
Wonderfly, a roachling has the 
choice of stocking inventory or 

"aloischus, " 
The Endearing Little 
Cockroach Who Is 
Sweeping The Nation 
In popularity, 
Is Providing A Means 

filling each order as it is made, 
which is most often preferred. 
Roachlings have the 
independence to set their own 
prices and can hire other 
students to work for them. 

To qualify for a Roachlingship, 
a student must be enrolled for a 
minimum of six credit hours in a 
college or university, submit an 
application, and $100 for a 
Roachling Starter Kit. The Staner 
Kit includes $95 worth of 
wholesale merchandise, L50 
posters, business cards, press 
releases, order forms and a 
suggestion booklet entitled "How 
to Approach Selling the Roach." 
If your past experiences with 
roaches have been only negative, 

For Capable And Motivated

interview dates were set. The 
conversation ended. 

I phoned again when I heard, 
his voice on the radio. We begah 
to get to know each other. I 
mentioned the interview once 
again , and he reiterated the fact 
that I could interview him 
anytime. No definite dates had 
been set, and again, the 
conversation ended. 

Ten minutes later I heard on 
the air, "AIe you taking notes, 
Va\?" This led me to believe he 
thought the whole thing was a 
joke. I stopped calling the station 
when he was working, although 
he only fills in when one of the 
regulars is unavailable . 
Nonetheless, it is difficult to 
reach him at the station. 

A few months lapsed, and that 
now familiar voice began to DJ 
more often. I dialed the number 
and .we talked. At this pOint, it 
was evident that I was not 
joking, and we talked for fifteen 
minutes. It was like I was making 
up for lost time with an old pal. I 
was intrigued . For the last time , I 
casually mentioned the story I 
was hoping to write soon. It 
finally happened ... an interview 
date was set. 

This was no ordinary 
interview. He invited me to 
interview him while he was on 
the air. This proved benefiCial, 
because I gained insight to the 
broadcasting business and the 
pace of a DJ's job. Never a dull 
moment! 

1 arrived at the radio stalion at 
10 pm when he started his shift 
that ended at 2 am. He mct me 
10 the lobby. If he didn't say 
anything, ) would have had no 
idea who he was. We went into 
the little room where the 
broadcasts arc produced. Yes, ) 
was Silting there with the 
"familiar voice" of a total 
stranger. 

My nervousness ccased after a 
few songs. He went about his 
business, whtle I sat and listened 
10 awe at the way the broadcast 
IS done. I noticed that his easy 

going attitude is not only 
projected in his radio voice, but 
is f.~ present in his personality 
ana mannerisms. 

I conducted an informal 
interview, which was more like a 
philosophical discourse. He 
offered an abundance of 
information, including 
experiences and anecdotes 
which exemplified his 
enthusiasm for, and expertise in 
the broadcasting field. 

My expectations were 
':ompletely out of tune. Previous 
to these conversations with the 
familiar voice, I had placed the 
media and radio broadcasting on 
a pedestal. Through this 
friendship, I have realized DJ,s 
are just like you and me. "Most 
have a unique character, great 
sense of humor, and are 
imrovened," the DJ. said. And of 

·course they must cherish quality 
vocal chords. 

According to his philosophy, 
"He tries to target who's 
listening, and why they're 
listening." His main philosophy 
is "Have Jun, and project that 
attitude. Listeners want positive 
reinforcement." He feels that one 

maybe it 's time to tum over a 
new leaf. 

"Can aloischus change the 
roach's image? He is cuddly and 
funny," Wonderly maintains."He 
bears no malice toward anyone, 
even though he knows humans 
have stepped on his ancestors," 
Wonderly stated in a People 
Magazine article. 

I don't mean to sound cocky, 
but I'm just one of those guys 
you'd love to take home," says 
a1oischus. 

Interested people may write or 
call for more information and an 
application.

do ... mslide to the profession is 
that everyday his voice and 
mood are "not in the mood" to 
ponray these attitudes. 

It was around 11 pm and time 
for my tour of the surrounding 
studios in the building, We had 
o nly two minutes and seven 
seconds to get back to the 
studio, because the song that was 
playing was going to end. We 
went running through the halls, 
just like kids who had JUSt stolen 
something. We arrived back in 
time for him t, ,nake an 
announcement between songs. 
That was when it started to get 
fun. By this time, I felt 
comfonable enough lO joke and 
ask just about any question. We 
continued to talk and I read the 
funny memos on the walls, and 
the friendly reminders to the DJ. 
on the air. It was evident that 
they work as a team - as an 
extended family, and have fun 
doing so. . 

The station is B-l00 and the 
familiar voice is Mike Novak. Just 
as we should never judge a book 
by its cover, we should never 
judge a disc jockey by his voice. 
It's not all talk! (iJ 

Lumumba Zapata College 
Continued from page 1 
S<lId was wrought out of the 
collecllve feeling that "as 
minority students, we were being 
alienated and excluded from the 
campus as a whole ." Blanco said 
that during the three-year period 
where L-Z College was virtually 
under the control of the Board of 
Directors that "everyone felt as if 
he or she belonged, they were 
recruited by their peers . . . 
students, faculry , and staff of L-Z 
were generally united in a unique 
and incredible project." Reynold 
and Debaca added to this 
assessment by saying, "students 
and faculry members were 
involved in every committee on 
campus ... their level of 
panicipation and persistence 
enabled them to seriously effect 
the world around them ." 

The dream of a collective and 
democratic college faded quickly 
though . Put under the national 
conservative spotlight by Time 
magazine, Evans and Novak, the 

Copley press, and the former 
California governor Ronald 
Reagan 's spiteful adminismuion , 
the UCSD admimstration 
acquiesced to loud demand s to 
take control of L-Z college . When 
Provost Watson began violating 
the govemment chaner, the 
Asian American Student Alliance, 
the United Native Americans, the 
Movimiento Estudiamil Chicano 
de Aztlan (MEChA, which was 
bom from MAYA), and the White 
Caucas all called for Watsons 
resignation . They were joined in 
the call by about two-thirds of 
the L-Z faculty . Watson resigned 
on May 24 of 1972, but was 
called back on May 25 by then 
Chancellor McElroy, who stated 
that Ihe Provost would either 
have absolute tule over the 
college or he would dissolve it 
entirely. 

Watson later Withdrew his 
resignation in June. The students 
of L-Z College "felt betrayed ," 
said Debara, "went out on strike 
- with the exception of the 

Black Student Union ( B5U 
formerly BSC) - in April , but , 
accordi ng to Debaca, "couldn't 
achieve the same level of 
committmem that we once had 
.. we had been fighting the 
administration, government, and 
the right wing for three years, we 
were tired ." Blanco concurred 
with this analysiS, "We (the 
faculty) were doing such 
unorthodox things (in the view 
of the Regents) as collective 
teaching,and assigning readings 
by Third World scholars ... this 
was out of synct with UC 
tradition, and we were put under 
immense pressure to check 
everything with administrative 
committees. We were aU 
exhausted: 

Like many other unique 
student and faculry projects of 
the late 60s and early 70s, there 
were many casualties inflicted 
upon those involved . Debaca 
remisses, "During the strike of 
spring, 1972, professors were 
ordered to flunk any student 

"TOIEEP 
THE 

who was not attending his or her 
classes. Many student leaders 
were later expelled from school, 
and many supportive faculty 
members never received tenure 
at UCSD. The experience of 
bei ng attacked by the state at 
such an intense level left many 
of my friends lost and confused. 
Some of them died on the street 
as heroin addicts years later. But 
don't let that take away from all 
those students of L-Z College 
who have gone on to be some of 
the best lawyers, doctors, 
architects, painters , writers, and 
activists (notably Angela Davis) 
in the nation ." 

The question that conSistently 
lingers over Third College is 
whether or not it has achieved 
the ambitious goals of the L-Z 
period of liberation . self-
determination, ethnic freedom 
and equality under the present 
hIerarchical structure . Carlos 
Blanco believes that the present 
state of race relations in the 
United States is no better, if not 
worse , than it was during the late 
60s , citing the recent racially 
motivated attacks on blacks in 
New York and Georgia as

examples. Blanco also stated that, 
and Reynolds confirmed this , 
that minoriry enrollment in 
UCSD as a percentage of the 
overall student population is 
down from last year. Both these 
men , along with Debaca, 
expounded the general theme of 
unity and committment to the 
general principles of L-Z College 
if the students WIS: . to reenter 
the university decision-making 
process. Reynolds said "if we 
want to make serious progress 
here at UCSD, at Third College, 
we must get back to where we 
were before (at L-Z) and where 
we were going at that time ." 
Blanco finished by saying, "if 
students desire to unite again , 
they must find some common 
ground to unite on, and to 
realize the conditions you are 
living under, and then demand 
for what is realistic . We felt our 
demand for Lumumba-Zapata 
principles, and L-Z college was 
realistic: and we were right." ~

Hopes high for 
men's tennis 
By BRIAN ITOW 

T HIS team is young. Very young. Five of its top eight and seven of its twelve 
I players are freshmen. There is 
. only one se nior on this team. In 

fact. it seems like only yesterday 
that they were picking up their 
first rackets. Sull, the Men 's 
Tennis Team is full of experience 
and ready to contend for a spot 

weight room and on the tennis 
court." 

Hammenneister believes that 
his young team is full of . 
potential, especially among its 
top six players. All have potential 
to play Division 1lI tennis at a 
very competitive level. 

The team IS Icd by Hunter 
Galloway, a freshman from 

program nationally." The victory 
against Claremont has helped to 
revitalize the emotion of the 
team, leading them towards 
nationals. It was the first win in 
four years against the 
consistently powerful Division 
rivaL 

There has also been significant 
individual performances. Tracy 
Mulvany's time of 1:55.62 in the 
200 free-stroke has put her on 
top of the national rankings for 
that event. She also leads the list 
for the 200 intermediate. 
Michelle Steinberger is currently 
number three nationally in the 
200 fly with a time of 2:13.48. 

For the men, Kip Fulbeck has 
posted the third fastest time in 
the 50 free, and Bill 
Kazmierowicz is leading the 200 
free group with a 1:41.00, he also 
ranks number 2 in the 200 back. 
These efforts are followed by a 
number of outstanding times 
from the remainder of the team. 

Yet, with all of the success so 
far, Morgan refuses to accept it 
as a satisfying reward. His 
emphasis is placed on 
preparation for nationals, and 
the current victories are just pan 
of that preparation. Morgan 
states that nationals "aff not the 
ultimate goal of the program." 
Although he feels that, "winning 
a national championship is a 
realistic goaL" 

UGSD is currently r.mked no. 
two for the men and no. four for 
the women nationally. Nine men 
and seven women have qualified 
for national competititon, and 
Morgan feels that more have a 
legitimate chance of qualifying in 
the remainder of the season.

hosts Colorado College in the

S I EROID ACHIEVERS 

After four ~ars and several Bud Ught bribes. the SftROID 
ACHIEWRS finally have their dream come true - Bud Ught Team of 
the Week. Their stunning 40-36 victory over the highly touted 
STONED DICKS convinced even myself that this talented squad 
could be a force to be reckoned with in the big post-season 
toumament. Paced by .John Beck's 27 points. this high powered 
offense proved too much for the STONED DICKS. WIth player-coach 
Artie Shapiro changing up the STEROID AC .... va de~nsive 
scheme. the opposing offense was constantly baffled and confused. 
Jeff Shapiro's 8 points and 32 rebounds also pla~ a significant role 
in this impressive win. 

Since the early 1960s, 
Graham Nash has been in the 
forefront of rock music. With 
his flowing harmonies and 
poignant songwriting, he has 
played a role in many of rock 
and roU's finest moments, 
from Woodstock to Live Aid, 
and has been a member of two 
of rock's most legendary 
groups, The Hollies and also 
Crosby, Stills and Nash. 
Matching his musical skill is 
his constant deVotion to dial 
causes, such as nuclear power 
and environmental pro-
tection. Never at a loss for 
words, Nash will give a 
lecture/ performance tomor-
row night at Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

Graham Nash has always 
used his POSI tlon as a 
singer/ songwriter to be a 
public spokesman. He told 
Dave Zimmer, the writer of 
the CSN autobiography, "as a 
musician and a human being 
I've tried my best to make 
people aware of some of the 
things that they might not be 
aware of," Throughout his 
career, he has done just that in 
both song and deed, His 
presence at Woodstock in 
1969 with CSN& Y helped 
inspire a generation of young 
people to stand up for that 
which they believed. At 
Woodstock , he sang 
"Chicago," a protest song 
over a death sentence in that 
city. In it he sings: "We can 
change the world/ Rearrange 
the world / It's dying .. . to get 
better." 

Nash has spent the better 
part of his life trying to change 
the world he lives in. Either 
solo or with CSN, he has 
never failed to make a 
statement; as in the late 
19708, when Crosby and 
Nash cut the album "Wind on 
the Water." The title song 
dealt harshly with the ongoing 
slaughtering of whales. They 
Sing "Over the years you have 
been hunted/ by the men who 
threw harpoons/ And in the 
long run he will kill you/ Just 
to feed the pets that we

sights to the anti-nuclear 
movement, when he helped 
organize MUSE (Musicians 
United for Solar Energy) , 
During this time, concert 
promoter Billy Graham said 
of Nash, "When Graham 
Nash is concerned about some-
thing, he doesn't [just] talk, 
he does, He takes action. 
Graham is an organizer. He's 
not a follower ." He helped 
organize the No Nukes 
l oncerts with Jackson 
Browne, and for the sake of 
the cause reunited CSN for 
the four day event. He made 
an appearance in 1980 l s 
Survival Sunday benefit 
concert in Hollywood and was 
the talent organizer for 1982's 
extravaganza Peace Sunday in 
Pasadena. 

The largest rally of its kind , 
Peace Sunday boasted a line-
up of singers including 
Jackson Browne, :rom Petty. 
Dan Fogelberg and Stevie 
Wonder, as well as many 
speakers. Nash wrote "Barrel 
of Pain" in 1980, protesting 
the dumping of nuclear waste 
in the waters of San Francisco, 
The song expressed the anger 
of many over the proliferation 
of nuclear power, and it 
quickly became the watch 
word of the movement. He 
sings: 1'1 can see the writing on 
the wall / 1 can feel the ax 
before it falls/ 1 can really feel 
it getting through to me/ I can 
see the sea begin to glow/ I can 
feel it leaking down below/ [ 
can barely stand it what we're 
doing to ourselves." 

Just asGraham Nash helped 
lead the youth of the sixties 
into their own, he has also 
been instrumental in the 
resurgence of so c ial 
consciousness in the 1980s. [n 
front of the global audience at 
live Aid, Nash helped 
legitimate the event with a 
bringing together of past and 
present with a Crosby, Stills, 
Nash and Young reunion. [n 
1986, he also took part in the 
Greenpeace Benefit in New 
Zealand. 

Born in 1 ~2 amidst a war-
stri c ken England, Nash 
quickly was inspired by music 

at the age of five when he met 
schoolmate Allan Clarke. The 
two sang at night clubs from 
age 14, and in 1962, after 
forming many other bands, 
they formed The Hollies, 
named after Buddy Holly. 
Success brought the Hollies to 
the company of the Beatles 
and Rolling Stones, and in the 
mid-sixties, their success 
brought them to America, 
where in Los Angeles, Nash 
met Cass Elliot of the Mamas 
and the Papas, In 1966, she 
introduced him to David 
Crosby, then playing with the 
Byrds, A few years later they 
met up with Steph~n Stills, 
who was part of Buffalo 
Springfield. On December 9 , 
1968, the trio officially 
formed CSN, and began their 
legendary success. One of 
Nash 's first compositions for 
CSN was " Our House" 
written for Joni Mitchell . 
Over the next nineteen years, 
Nash wo uld write such 
classics as "Teach Your 
Children," " Cathedral" and 
" W asted o n the W ay." 

Though his p resence has 
already left a lasting mark in 
music history, Graham Nash's 
full impact on rock and roll 
and the world is yet to be 
ultimately decided since he is 
still very active. In the 
introduc tion to Zimmer 's 
book on CSN, he compares 
them to the Beatles, Rolling 
Stones and Bob Dylan. calling 
them a major contribution to 
the formation of rock and 
roll. In the same book Nash 
wrote: "I think we've added 
some good feeling to the 
universe. I think that Crosby, 
Stills and Nash music will last, 
and I think that generations to 
come will understand that we 
are three human beings that 
tried our best to be as real as 
possible. " 

Graham Nash will perform 
at Mandeville Auditorium

puts it) "the mutilating of a

Galdikas will give a lecture

people who are perhaps 
unaware of this travesty, 
hoping to commit some of

What do you go to a 
thriller/ horror movie for? 
You usually don't go for the 
superior acting or engaging 
story. Most likely you go to be 
thrilled or horrified . You 
enter the theatre planning to 
play a game, where it's you 
against the movie. 

If you "beat" the film, that 
is, you are not emotionally 
pulverized by the climactic 
scenes, then the film failed to 
provide the entertainment it 
provide. You feel gypped and 
you leave the film with 
unwanted victory under 
belt and an unsa 
emptiness in your wallet.

about a 

movie by looking not at the 
screen, but at the audience. 
The audience that viewed The 
Stepfather with me was a 
particularly vocal and active 
one. 

The unaccompanied man 
on the aisle seat two rows 
ahead of me, spent most of the 
movie with his head lowered 
approximately two inches 
from his knees. He shook his 
head from side to side, 
occasionally placing his 
interlocked hands on his 
head, nervously running his 
fingers through his disheveled 
hair . Periodically, he peered 
up from his sanctuary, only to 
retreat in the face of mayhem. 
Clearly, this man was losing 
the game and presumably 
enjoying every minute of it. 

The vociferous woman 
three rows behind me seemed 
to feel compelled to plead 
with, and then reprimand, the 
innocent victim to "run,

attention to their work in the 
field, to "murdering 
poachers" trying to trespass 
the forest. 

"There are people who will 
try to justify replacing forests 
as a means to less expensively 
raise cattle. But desttoying 
what took nature millions of 
years to c rea te is not the wa y, " 
she says. UCSD resident 
primatologltlt, Jim Moore 
echoes, "By cutting the trees 
down, the very land becomes 
a desert where no one will be 
able to raise food anymore. 
It's a disaster." 

Despite numerous film 
documentaries on her work, 
the "monkey woman" still 
seems to have trouble proving 
how equally important her 
work is in comparison to 
other government funded 
studies. Galdikas says she 
receives a lot of enjoyment 
from going on a lecture 
circuit, which, at the same 
time, helps defray her 
expenses. 

Galdikas will unveil at 
length two of her latest 
discoveries about female 

Orangutans at the upcoming 
UCSD lecture. First, that the 
females don't give birth to any 
offspring until they reach 
fifteen years of age or more, 
and second, in the wild, a 
female's genetalia becomes 
swollen and turns white. She 
hopes that all her work will 
ultimately help mankind 
better understand his position 
along the evolutionary chain 
and his relationship to other 
species. .

or the past 15 years, anthropologi t Birute 
Galdikas has dedicated her lire to the study 
of the orangutans of the rainforests of 

Orangutans are in danger of extinction not 
only because buge sections of the 
orangutans' habitat are being turned into 
farms and logging sites, but also because 
wealthy Indonesians insist on trying to 

keep them as exotic pets. While the impulse to tum 
orangs into companions i destructive , Galdikas 
understands the impluse--with orangs, perceptlons of 
human and animal behavior tend to blur. "They use 
tools, like to wear bits and pieces of clothing, love Junk 
food and candy and want constant attention and 
affection . They express emotions such as anger and 
embarrassment in a way that seems very like humans. 
I was actuaUy beginning to, doubt whether orangutans
