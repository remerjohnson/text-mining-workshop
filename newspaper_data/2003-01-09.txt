tends that "Iow-w:lge and middle-mcome workers 
arc finding it hardcr to get by in San Diego, where 
thc COSts for basic needs are rlSmg beyond afford-
ability." 

Thc resolution also tates that "the ASU SO 
belie,'es lh ~ ~ living-wage Job; build strong famille\ 
and healthy COIllIllUnltleS, and ... It 1\ beneficial to 

ScraphIs by? 

the health anu welfare of all 111 San Dlcgo that 
worker have ,I IivJble wage, benefits nnu respect." 

"Livmg In ' an Diego, you've got a high coSt of 
living," said A.S. Vice Pre~ldent Internal KeVin 
I I ~u, who ~ubmltleu the resolution. "1 f you have 
people Iwho,e wages all ow theml to takc care of 
themselves, they'll be able to berter contnbute to 
the economy." 

The resolution also quesrions government ~ub­
sidlzatlon of low-wage, state-contracteu Job, 
asser ting that "our tax dollars shoulu not create or 
subslulze poverty jobs."

with Bada when she took a class

continued from page 1 
The Kresge Foundation is an 

independent, private foundation that 
suppOrts a wide range of organiza-
tion ' in the nonprofit sector. 
Through its challenge grants, the 
foundation hopes to help organiza-
tions broaden their base of support 
frolll the private sector and attract 
volunteers and local efforts in the 
fundraising process. 

"I'm very grateful that we 
received a grant from thi~ particular 
organization in this amount. It 's a 
lestimonial to the high regard in 
which the playhouse is held," said 
Joel Iioll iday, chairman of the La 
Jolla Playhouse 130ard of Trustees. 
"This is one of the most discriminat-
ing foundations, and we mllst be 
doing sOlllething right to have 
received the grant." 

' Ib receive the $1 million grant, 
the playhouse mu t meet the founda-
tion's challenge to complete a $4 1 
million Capital Campaign. 

T he Capital Campaign has three 
a~pect~ : the new building, to be com-
pleted in May 2004; endowments; and 
annual operating support. Another 
requirement of the grant is that the 
fund raised to meet the Kresge 
[7ollndation's challenge must support 
the campaign's endowment aspect. 

"The viSIOn represented hy the 
.lpital C:llnpaign is about buildmg a 

theater in so many ways - budding 
physically, building artistically and 
building community," Said led 
CranstOn, co-chair of the Capital 

.lInp.ugn. 
I.ike mOSl typlc,lI major cam-

paigns, the last phase of the play-
homes campaign il1l'olves rcaching 
out to the community to generate 
funds and to seek mcreased cJpltal 
)UPport from its current base of 
donors. 

"The Kresge Foundation has 

worked out a formula for the chal-
lenge grant," Il olliday said. "They 
know that the toughest part of a cap-
ital campaign is the latter part, when 
the comlTlwlity thinks the campaign 
is done. 0 they've developed a 
model for the challenge grant for 
institutions like the Playhouse to help 
push them to get over the goal line." 

The campaign has already raised 
$800,000 more that ils original goal 
of $36 million, 0 the playhouse 
needs to raise the remaining $4.2 
million by July I to receive the 
grant. 

"We are guardedly optimistic," 
said La Jolla Playhouse Managing 
Director Terry Dwyer. " We arc 
aware that it's an economically cha l-
lenging time. \Ne need to reach out 
to thousands of donors to meet the 
Kresge challenge." 

As part of its strategy to meet the 
foundation's goal, the playhouse has 
sta rted a paver program through 
which patrons can purchase 
engraved paver stones thut will be 
integrated into the new theater com-
plex plaza. 

According to Dwyer, the 
Playhollse board is also contributing 
more money and looking to recruit 
new board mcmbers. 

"Our entire fUlldraising operation 
IS dedicated to meeting the chal-
lenge. Every componelll of our orga-
nizallon is creating programs 10 cul-
tivate our audiences bener," Dwyer 
said. 

The La Jolla Playhouse is uedi-
catcu to advancing theater as an art 
form at the 10CJI and national level. 
It commissions three to five play per 
year. h, \ 'c believe that we arc a leader 
111 the adoption of new plars. Il's 
aboul supporting the developmcnt of 
great new plays and artisl~," Dwyer 
said. 

"I took a class called geochem-
istry and I liked the professor, so I 
asked him if he had any openings 
for undergradua tes doi ng 
research," Zauscher said. 

At the time, Bada had no open-
ings, but several months latcr he 
asked Zauscher if she would be 
interested in working with him to 
date mammals, since he had dis-
covered a way 10 do so. 

"The oldest whale dated was 
211 years old," Zallscher said. 
"The oldest one in our group was 
1120 years old], which is still pret-
ty old." 

Zauscher is a participant in 
several undergraduate research 
programs facilitated by lhe 
Academic Enrichment Program, 

CAM.P. is a federally funcled 
program open to minority Stu-
dents in the sCiences. Il offers 
workshops on study tips, field 
!Tips, book scholmhips and has a 
b<Jok exchange program. 

CAM.P. also covers the costs 
of transportation for snldems like 
Zallscher to get to the conferences 
theyanend. 

A~ a participant in the Faculty 
Mentor and McNair programs 
run by AEP, Zauschcr was given 
many opportunities to do research 
alongside faculty members, thus 
getting a taste for graduate stud-
ies, according to AEP Director 
David Artis. 

"We give SI1ldents a chance to 
get some opportunities to do first-
hand research," Artis said. "11,at's 
the kind ()f experience that \\~ II 

In the Faculty J\,lenror 
Program, sl1ldents enroll in a two-
quarter course in which they do 
research with a de~ignated faculty 
supervisor. They put in 1 () hours a

rhe UCSD GuardIan 15 published {\',1Ce a wee!. al the UnlVers,ty of 
Callforn,a at San Diego COnlenls (c) Z003. Views expressed here,n 

lepresen the majon vote of the ed,torloll board and are not necessar· 
I~' those of the UC Board of Regents, he ASUCSD or Ihe members of 

the CuordlOn staff 

UCSD's 2003 
will fulfill these 
wishes, we hope 

The beginning of a new r ear u ually ha. 
people erring goal for the future and con-
templating what it i they really want in life. 
Following in that tradition, and stemming 
from our de ire to improve the C D 
community, the GUf1rdif171 would like to 
offer thi 'humble wi h Ii t for UC D m 
2003 : 

1. Beer gardens at UCSD events. 
We're going to beat this dead horse until 
the American ocier), for the Prevention of 
Cmelt)' to Animals calls and tells u to quit. 
With reliable carding and enough security, 
there will be fewer intoxicated minor at 
athletic events and 1uirstock than there 
are in a residence hall suite on an average 
Thursdal' nierht. 

2, More Unolympic-style events pit-
ting the six colleges against each other. 
Basic social theory tells us that individuab 
develop group identity by competing with 
other groups. rf TCSD really want us to 
think of ourselves way deep down in our 
hearts a~ members of our coll ege , then let 
the game begin. College mascots might 
also be in order; perhal)s a Grateful Dead 
bear for John .\luir Col ege ? 

3, As an exten ion of that, UCSD is in 
di re need of a real, authentic rivalry, 
Triton Tide's efforts to get srudent to road 
games is a Hep in the right direction, for 
only when we can egg a campus based pure-
ly on our love for UCSD can we really call 
ourselves an athletically competitive uni-
versity. A corollary: C 0 needs a fight 
song and a marchins- band to play it, even if 
their only venue IS Library Walk on a 
,\1onday morning. If we're not going to get 
fired up about sports, let's at least get excit-
ed for school. 

4. Improvement in the colleges' acad-
emjc advising offices. Overall, me quality 
of service is there, but too often students 
think they're ready to graduate and then are 
told they need one or two more classes. 
With the mainly friendly and competent 
staffs, it should be no problem to rise from 
"good" to "excellent." 

5, A greater sense of connection 
between UCSD and the surrounding La 
JollalUTC communi ty, Part of this needs 
to come From our end - freshmen, stop 
going home every weekend~ - and part of 
this problem is their fault. For exumpk, 
we 'd like to ~ee T.G.I. Fridays have student 
happy hours before fin:lb week and special 
events after big game~ agaimt Our LO-be-
determined rivals. 

And, finally, in decreasing order of likeli-
hood, we wish for: an A.S. president who 
can beat Chancellor Robert Dynes in next 
year's SK, a IS-minute passing period, more 
alumni giving, world peace and more S-
spots in West campus. Happy New Year, 
UCSD.

Flap over Trent Lott uncalled for 
M an y overreact to praise of Strom Thurmond

Trent L Oll said at a birthday part)'. 

I li s \Iords eventually led to his 
stepping down as enate maJomy 
leade r on Jan . 6, the day before the 
Senate reconvened . Bill Fnst, a 
Republican from Tenne sec , ha taken 
hiS pl ace. 

"In the IIltercst of pursulllg the best

sa id after reall7Jllg that the political

Irrcpairable. 

ThiS bit of nun-proporuonal con-
tT{)vcr,y arose after he made a remark 
at former ell. Strom Thurmond 's 
100th birthday party that some 
assumed was praise for the 54-year-old 
,cgrcgationi~t policies of the 1940 
OlxlI.:crats. 

Thurmond had denounced these 
poll c le~ later In IllS career, lIwitchlng 
partlcs from Democrat to 
Repuhll can. "I want to say thl' about 
Ill y state, \Vhen Strom Thurmond 
ran fo r preSident , we voted for hlln. 
We 're proud of It," LOll said on Dec. 
5. " t\lld If the reM of the country had 
followed our lead, we wouldn 't h.we 
had JII the,e problems over ,III these

Shortly after, PreSident George

explJln that he wa, merely attempting 
to cheer up 3n old man on hiS birth-

Civil liberties should not be sacrificed 
By JESSICA LlNGEL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

There never was a war that did 
not have unforeseen conse-

that didn't cause fear and uncer-

where peoplc wanted to be 
destroyed. 

Th~ thll1g ahout Presidcnt

here. Peoplc arc already afraid and

without charging them with a

con.,ervative arc finding such g"'r-
IIlg trespasses of ba;ic founding 
principles difficult to defend. 

Jose Padilla and Yascr Esam 
1 !admi, two U.S. citizens, are both 
currently In solitary confinement 
under military control. Padilla, the 
alleged dirty bomber, was original-
ly detained by feder,d agents upon 
arrival at Chicago O' l iare 
Imernational Airport as a material 
witness in a New York grand iury

Perha ps some-
one will say that 
this is a necessary

fails to consider 
the gravity of such 
an infraction. 
What is neces~ary

free society with

so. \ Vhat is neces-

ment has made light concession. 
The \ Vhite I louse has agreed that 
the federal courts have some right 
tv review such detentions, bur it 
has inSisted that any such review 
should be mll1il1lal Jnd that the 
enemy comhatants ~houldn 't have 
access to legal counsel due to the 
possi bi Ii ty that they may pas, 
information to terrorist org3l11za-
lIuns. 

This i the price of thl' war, 
3ml it is 3 costly one. It, causes are 
clear, its effects complicated. A 
disaster strikes and people hecollle 
frightcned . In the name of home-
IJnd security, the governmcnt 

t .lke~ ~tcp~ to prC\'Cnl terrOrl; m, 
violating civil IIherties along the 
way. In the name of justice, rights 

vary or treacherous, are violated 
withollt due process, t11en they are 
violated for u all. Such a devastat-
ing loss to civil liberty is not a rea-
sonable cost. That is not a jus tifiable 
demand. That is not a pUI1l~hmcl1l 
of treason, but rather J treacherous 
act against onc!; own country. 

Perhaps someone will say that 
thiS i parr of war, that it has hap-
pened before and that the country 
ha, survived . An obvious example 
are thcJapanesc internmcnt C.lll1p' 
of \Vorld \\'ar 11, in which thou-
sands of U.S. citi zens were foreihly 
removed from their hOllies and 
held under governmcnt consent

nited States from possible espI-
onage. Later, the adlllinl~trJtion of 

Bush Sr. admitted that the camps 
were wrong, and subsequent 
financial reparations were made. It 
wa, wrong then, and It IS wrong 
now. Such actions arc not wagmg 
war on another country but 
against our, elves. 

The same government that 
claims to he defendll1g the 
Amencan way of life IS 111 fact VIO-
lating the foundll1g ideals bTtlaran-
teed 111 the COIl,rinltlon. [f such 
infractions of rights like Il.!gal rep-
resentation Jnd habeas corpus are 
allowed to continue in the nJllIe of 
national defense, then we Jrc Jctu-
all y des troying ourselves, not pre-
venting destruction on heh.l lf of 
someone else.

fact that oth er peopl e agree I' 11 01 a 
soune! ju tlfica tion for an :Irgulllcnt. 
But It IS an inlhca tlon of what peo-
ple believe. \\'hen a democratic 
SOCiety ,Igrees that CIVil hhcrtles 
should not be vio/atrd In the name 
of preventing terromm , thcn thclr 
government repre~en t3t l ve, arc 
obligated to respond accordingly. i\ 
J anuary 2002 Gallup Poll showed 
that 62 percent of those surveyed 
did not think that the ~ovcrnll1e nt 
should take steps to pre~'ent tcrror-

i ~m If It means tJking their cwil hh-
ertie away. Government offi Ci als 
are elected to represent the people 
who voted them into office. People 
do not wi h to gi\'e up their rights. 
The government has a responsibil -
ity to respect that wish. 

No one wants to let terronstS 
go. No one wants to endanger this 
country by allowing people guilty 
of treason to continue plotting 
against the United StJ te . But If 
citizens like Padilla dnd Hadml arc 
held without chargcs or counsel , 
then fdr more is endangered thJn

race - that we

the essence of

aid to be the 

result of pushing 
for greater states' 
rights, and were 
supported by 
some racists for 
this end. But oth-
ers hold that these 
laws were merely 
a by-product of 
the practice of 
state' rights , a 

equality. 

mi conception, 
indeed the most suc~ 
cessful, myopic, dis~ 
torted view of race, 

The most 
Important mis-
conception, 
IIldeed the most 

is that people succeed 
or fail as a group, " 

\uccessful, myopic, distorted view 
of race, IS that people succeed or 
fail ,IS 3 group. They don't; they 
ucceed or fall a IIldlvldual. Yet 

thiS IS exactly the type of refusal 
of IndiVidual responsihility for 
your aCtions - rou ca n JUSt 
blJme your group membership -
that has been drilled into our 
brains bl' the liberal elite . 

For some, group member hip 
IS Important when it brings bene-
fits With It. But It's about time we 
tn:at people of all colors and 
creed, as IIldlvlduals, not fal~ely 
lump them into groups. Even 
wor,e, members of the left arc 
tl»1ng to link Lon's supposed ly 

conservative 
poliocal philosophy that pushe, 
for a usurpation of federal power 
by gWlI1g more power to indiVid-
ual states, thereby reducing the 
possibility of federal tyranny. 

Former President Bill Clinton 
summed up the democratic talk-
ing points on thiS maner concise-
ly when he sa id , "I low ean they 
[Republicans] attack him [LonJ? 
lie just embarra~ses them by !>ay-

\\fhat Clinton and other

After taking the long-awaited 
drive home for vacation, I have 
become more aware of the amount 
of cars on the road and just how 
obnmoous we are as drivers. ot 
only are highways overpopulated, 
but they are overpopulated with 
inefficient and unnecessary vehi -
cles. 

Spon utility vehicles have now 
expanded from something to tow 
your boat with into the new fami-
ly minivan or ghetto-fabulous 
riJe . a result of this image 
update, the number of SVVs on 
the road is rising. and now small 
cars are confronted with new safe-
ty concerns. 
. onsumers fail to acknowledge 

that large UVs are only the safe t 
cars on the road because they cause 
the IllOSt damage. According to a 
Nrw l1wk Times press release, when 
an UV and a car get into an acci-
dent, the car pa sengers are four 
times more likely to die than if the 
accident occurred between two cars 
of similar size. When a car is 
broadsided by an SUV. the car pas-
engers are 27 time more likely to 

die. Cars are designed to withstand 
collisions with vehicles of tlle same 
hape and within 500 pounds of 

their own weight. SUVs tend to 
weigh at least 1,000 pounds more 
than the average car and therefore 
will always cause more damage 
than the car is capable of sustain-
ing. 

\.\'hile some ay th,ll the olu-
tion I to raise the 'saftey figures of 
small cars, I would suggest only 
markcting UVs for those of u 
who need to [Ow hou,es and the 

COMMENTARY 

" Unless you roU with a 
posse, have a family of 
six, a boat, two horses 

and a trailer, you should 
not be driving an SUVi" 

like. It is entirely common to see 
SVVs transporting nothing morc 
than their drivers - no passen-
gers, no cargo, certainly no hous-
es. So unless you roll with a posse, 
have a family of six, a boat, two 
horses and a trailer, you should 
not be driving an SUV! 

Driving 010 in an SVV IS just 
plain wasteful. Each gallon of gas 
burned puts 20 pounds of carbon 
dioxide 11110 the atmosphere. The 
Environmental Protection Agency 
stated that choosing a car that gets 
25 miles to the gallon over a car 

that only gets 20 miles will keep 10 
tOns of carbon dioxide fTom being 
released over the car's lifetime. 
SVV manufacturers a re not 
required by law to maim, in eft1-
cient fuel economy levels for over-
sized vehicles and therefore CJn 
legally make a car that is not only 
expensive to buy, blll expensi ve to 
drive. Ford Excursions, for eXalll -
pie, get only 10 miles to the gallon 
in the city and 13 on the highway, if 
you are lucky. 

Marketing has prompt cd EIIIlI-
lies ro replace that good 01' mini-
van with oversized UVs. \\'h ilc 
this trategy illcrca~ed sales alld 
made some bus I ness - head, 
wealthier, It created problcms for 
those of us who share the road . 
Keeping a .afe distance while dri -
ving is impossible now hecau,e 
drivers in Suburbans see Ihal as 
merging space, and parking lots 
are always hell because SVV dri -
vers seem to think that lines des-
ignating parking places are mere 
suggesti ns. 

Perhap in order to drive an 
ovt!r ized vehicle, a spe ial license 
should be required, similar to dn-
vers of motorcycles and hlg-rlg,. If 
thdt were IIhtituted, maybe tho,c 
moms will learn to park or learn to 
stick to the minivan they know. By 
adding the obstacle of the OJ\1 V, 
consulllers will choose c;lrs appro-
priate for their daily use and in turn 
save lives and make cleaner .Iir for 
all of us .

THURSDAY. JANUARY 9. 200) THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Horse: Student parking vanishes over break 
continued from page 5 

bad form, however, to refuse to 
drop the new raises in light of 
UCSA's deficit when the 
University of California faces an 
ana logous situation. However fit-
ting and normal the new tipends 
Illay be, UCSAS decision not to 
make a meaningful gesture with its 
own situation is not exactly (p:lr-
don the expression) a classy move. 

It was difficult, however, to 
ascertain quickly what exactly the 
stances of UCSA and Associated 
Student Council were on the fee 
increase; the UCSA Web page has 
not been updated in a year, and 
ASU SD's Web page has been 
ofnll1e. One would hope that the 

spoke~pcople for the masses 
would deign to update their con-
stil1lcnts on what exactly goes on. 
But then if they published their 
own material online and actually 
made a concerted effort to inform 
UCSD smdents, there would not 
be quite a bit less need for a cer-
tain student publication, would 
there nor? 

A malai e, little known as 'B-spot creep,' struck UCSD over winter break 
after lying largely dormant 
through fall quarter. Muir resi-
dents came back to lind twO full 
rows of " '" space parking adja-
cent to Tenaya Ilall corrupted 
and rendered useless between the 
hours of 7:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. 
Given that the average waking 
hour of the Muir resident is 
about ten minutes before class 
~tart~, the newly converted rows, 
like those adjacent to \ Varrcn 
homll1g converted over the SUI1\-

mer, are now large ly useless on 
weekend nights . While Warren 
residents have long dea lt with the 
impossibility of finding parking 
c lose to home, up ti ll now 
M uirions led a cushy existence 
with the guarantee of close park-
ing. That situation, however, 
seems to be becoming more 
imperiled; a late night survey of 
the Muir lot found about 40 open 
spaces, minus the 18 cars parked 

" A malaise, little known as 
'B~spot creep,' struck 

UCSD over the winter 
break after lying largely 

dormant through fall 
quarter, " 

in B spaces for the night. 
The net result is that there is 

virtually no space for commutcr 
students in the Muir lot during 
the day (though hardly anyone 
bothered there anyway unless 
he/she fclt like sitting around for 
half an hour waiting aimlessly for 
a pot) . 

Even more worrisome for 
Muir residents, perhaps, is the 
coming prospect of the meager 
existence of a Warren denizen; 
with barely 10 percent more cars, 
Muir permit holders could find 
themselves scrambling for spaces 
in thc evel1lng, unable to park if 
they arrive late at I1Ight. At thiS 
rate, it might not be even worth it 

for the freshmen to fill the lots 
with their largely unused vehicles, 
if when returning from their socia l 
outing at SDSU late at night they 
wi ll be hard pressed to find any 
spots. 

This writer has maintained that 
with the exception of extreme cir-
cumstances, freshmen should bc 
barred from kceping cars on wcst 
campus (or even east campus). Not 
only are on-campus job opportu-
nities plentiful and accessible, but 
the on-campus social a tmosphcrc 
of UCSD (which rivals a mornla!)' 
in terms of excitemcnt) would 
Inc\'itably improve if freshmen 
werc forced to learn to tolerate 
each other. The point of going to 
college and living on campus is 
most definitely not to return home 
everv weekend. 

Or for that matter, fre,hmen 
year at college I;' most defil1ltcly 
not leaving one's car III a perfect-
ly good west ca mpus "S" spot 
whilst the green squares plan 
their next assault over the pave-
ment. 

O verheard in parking lot 412, next to the collec-tion of shacks collectively 
referred to as University Center: 
"Well, it's after hours anyways, I 
don't think they're going to ticket 
the reserved spots. 60' ? That's 
not worth $60!" I larsh, but effec-
tive, it seems.

Republican: Dems guilty of racist gaffe 
concinued from page 6 

population that the Repuhlican 
party p.lnder to. 

Bm I challenge tho e who 
believe in this absurd conspiracy 
theory to Jig up the facts to where 
racism would payoff in an elec-
tion . WOlildn't political racism 
lead to a net loss of votes? If you 
don't believe so, put down 
"Conspiracy Theories for 
Dummies" and wake up. 

For those of you in tunc to 
conspiracy theories, it cou ld JUSt 
as easi ly be the modern democrat-
IC party that panders to racists . 

It was none other than cx-
President Clinton who in I c)c)3 
awarded the Presidential Medal of 

Freedom to en. J. William 
Fulbright, a former segregationist. 
Was Clinton chastised? No. Or 
how ahout Clinton's membership 
to an elite golf club that that 
shunned memberships to those 
that didn't fit their "correct" pro-
file while he was running for pres-
ident in the early '90s' 

And what about form(!r Ku 
Klu,x Klan member, nuw 
Democratic Sen . Robert Byrd, 
saying a short while ago on "Fox

\Vhat about Senator Byrd and hi:.

popular belief that Republ,cam 
are the party of racists, more 
Republicans than Dcmocrats 
votcd 111 favor of that same bill. 

Both parties have their skele-
tons. But to es entiJlly crucify 
Lott for minor remarks when im-
ilar actions or remarks by 
Democrats go virtuall}' undetect-
ed by the media is a double stan-
dard . For Democrats to excessive-
ly criticize Lon for prai sing a then

OPINION 7 

Are you paying for EDUCATION 
but getting INDOCfRINATION instead? 

You are if your professors 
• Push a one -sided perspective on 

controversial social and political issues. 
• Assign one-sided readings on topics of 

public debate. 
Silence or intimidate you from expressing 
views different from theirs . 

If instructors do these things, they are in violation 
of the UC faculty code of conduct: 

"Where it becomes necessary.,. to consider political, 
social, or sectarian movements, they are dissected and 
e.xamined--not taught, and the conclusion left, with no 
tipping oj the scales, to the logic oj the Jacts . ... The 
University assumes the right to prevent exploitation oj 
its prestige by ... those who would use it as a platfonn 
Jor propaganda." - UCAPM-OlO

"F. Scott Fitzgerald Thinks Over 
TIlE GREAT GATSBY" 

In 1924, F. SCOtt Fitzgerald began writing THE GREAT GATSBY 
It was destined to become the great American novel of the twentieth 
century. But, although Fitzgerald knew how good it was , he had many 
doubts about its reception. His letters to his editor Max Perkins are 
one of the great documentary records of how a novel goes through the 
press-getting rewritten all the time. Fitzgerald 's long disenchanled 
correspondence shows what was going through his mind, what he 
thought about himself, his audience-and the characters of his novel. 
The letters are an unequalled view of what it was like writing in 
America in the middle of the twenties.

UC expands internship 
program to state capital 

University purchases Sacramento 
office building for $18 million 

By CHARLES PROCTOR 
Dai ly Bruin (UCLA) 

( -WIRE) L GELES - Laying 
the fOtlndation for an expansion of its state 
capitol internship progralll, the Univcrsity of 
California has purchased an officc building in 
downtown acramento, Calif. 

Ithough plans arc in the works, officials 
say it will probably take at least tWO ycars for 
any noticeablc changcs to take effect. 

Thc building, located on acramento's K 
Strect ,\ \a II , lVa~ purchased for $18 million . 
Alrhough thc buildlllg is fully occupied with 
busines es, the Univer ity of California plans 
to c\'cntually convcrt some of it into da~s­
rooms and academic fa ilitic . 

The UC systcm currently opcra tes an 
illlcrn~hip program to Washington, D .C., a~ 
well as a much smallcr one to Sacramento. 
The programs allow srudcms to work in state 
and federal orficcs, nonprofit organizations, 
media and law firms. 

"\\'hat we're rrYlIlg to do here IS learn 
frolll our experience in Washington, D .. , 
and emulate our success there," said Stcphen 
Anlitn , thc umvcrsi ty's aSSistant vice presI-
dent for ~tatc governmental relations. 

Ardltti "~lid that at any gi\'en time, the 
nl\'crSllY of California has 275 snl(lelm 

il1tcrning In \\'ashmgton, D.C., eJrlling C 
credit and attending classes taught hy C 
profcssors. 

On the othcr hand, only about 60 to Ii) 
sUldcnts attend the Sacramento intern pro-
gram annually. These rudcnlS only Intern 
over the summer, do not cam LtC crcdlt, arc 
not IIlstruClcd by C faculty and are not pro-
vided With housing. 

The ntvcrSlry of California saw a chance 
to augment llS Sacramento program when the 
city's vacated \ Ve1l1stocks bUlldlltg, located 
foot ' leps J\\ .,)' from the capitol , went up for 
purchJw. 

"It secl11cd like an opportunity wc could 
not pJ) up, " Ardlltl Jld.

Unl\'cr>lty of C.llifornlJ ha!. no dcfirute pbm a, 
to how It Will go about IInpro\1ng the prO/,'Talll . 

The building currently houses statc agcncies 
and a Bank of America. Revenues from thc ten-
ants acntally generatc a profit for thc niversi ty 
of California of $600,000 annually, which i; 
being put in a reserve account for renovations. 

T he Univers ity of California hopes to 
convcrt some of tllC building il1to classrooms, 
a computer lab, a library and hOtlsing for 5111-
dents and faculty, although Stich cha nges 
would only be madc "gradually." 

"We will probably look at starting up 
omcthing more quickly on a smallcr hasls," 

said John Griffing, the ulliversiry's director of 
pu bl ic 'crvice programs In acrall1ctlto. 

.riffing poinred Out that it would take .It 
Icast twO years for the academic senate lO 
complete and approvc plans for rcnovati(}n~ . 

"I think the vely earliest we could gCt cven 
a small hint of the internship progralll would 
bc thc fall of 20(H," Ardilli said. 

Thc reccnt budget shortfalls of thc Statc 
governmcnt could abo ; Iow down progrc~; . 

Eventually, thc ' acralllcnto prog-r.lm

THL'RSDAY. JA~L'ARY 9. ZOOJ 

Fed up with Blockbuster or Hollywood Video's limited selection ? T heir overpriced 
rentals? WIth over 20.000 videos. 
Kensington Video is the solution. 
From UCSD. take 8 East to 15 
South. exit Adams Ave.. rurn right 
and you wi ll find yourself at Ken 
Video (4067 Adams Ave.) and its 
goldmine of new and classic fil ms. 

The fi rst wall you see after 
walking into the store is the "clas-
sics" rack. where I was instantJy 
bombarded with ti tJes of which I 
had never heard. If you like 
authenticity and originality in 
films, :are obsessed with classic 
films, or just get a lcick out of 
cheesy overacting, then this is the 
place for you. Sadly, we are a gen-
eration that is wi rnessing the 
remake of nearly every one of these 
classics - it might be impressive 
during party conversations to 
reveal your knowledge about the 
original version of which the 
remake of the remake was made. 

Ken Video is where this remedial 
education of film ought to take 

THE UCSD GUARDIA 

place: Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, Alfred 
Hi tchcock. Audrey Hepburn and 
Steve McQueen each practically 
have their own mini-libraries, with 
nothing left out. 

In the "popular;' "comedy" and 
"children" sections. I found the 
same cumula tive selection; newer 
classics surrounded by older ones 
that had disappeared from the 
shelves of the local video stores of 
my childhood, which all went under 
WheJl Blockbuster and Hollywood 
set up camp. It is comforting to 
know that someone still holds the 
torch. 

Wallcing into yet another room, I 
found the "foreign" section. It was 
like walking into the Independent 
Film Channel's archive. At this 
point, r thought to myself, "r could 
come in here every night of my life 
and rent one movie until the day I 
die and still probably not see them 
all." 

Browsing the "animated" and 
"sporrs" shelf, I overheard some 
guy using the term "cult classic-
about a Japanese animated flick 

called "Ghost in the Shell ." I stood 
there fascinated by how much Ken 
Video screamed "cult-classic" 
while Max Headroom seemed to 
laugh at me. 

The "Twilight Zone" library 
stood in between the sci-fi and hor-
ror sections, which were also quite 
extensive. I have grown accustomed 
to the piling of these sections into 
"action" the way they do at 
Blockbuster. and this is often a con-
fusing misnomer. 

The last row consisted of docu· 
mentaty-style videos. It was like the 
Sci-Fi Channel, Discovery Channel 
and History Channel's archives 
combined. There were OG "Nova" 
series. "National ~phic", old-
school surf, skate and ski (Warren 
Miller~ galore). and OG porn for 
boys or girls who like either boys or 
girls, or both. 

The rules of rental are a little 
more suict than the corporate 
video stores. since Ken Video has 
something worth protecting. 
Renters are responsible for loss, 
damages and late fees, which are 

INside 
film "eviews 1 J 
7lIovit rhllts 11 
cniendill' 12 

automatically taken from your 
deposir. Despite this tough love. 
the rental charge for one video for 
a member is typically $2 .50. I was 
treated with a professionalism that 
the stoned teenage clerks at the 
corporate stores had made me for-
get; even the old lady resheJving 
the videos, Winnie. wanted to dis-
cuss films with me. Also s urprising 
was the "suggestion list" of films. 
Dare I say, it seemed as if they 
actually care about their customers. 
Many rare videos can also be found 
for sale within the store. 

The only drawback to Ken 
Video is that irs DVD selection is 
quite limited. although it does exist. 
Pam, the clerk who helped me, said 
that the "foreign" Kcrion inventory 
could be found online at 
bttp:II""",be,., .cox. rltt Ilttnvidtol. 
Ken Video is slowly making the 
jump into modern technology, but I 
hope that through this process they 
can preserve their authenticity, 
since their corporate counte,'pans 
have lost that which Ken Video 
maintains.

THUR DAY, JANUARY 9, l003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Edward Norton delivers with '25th Hour' 
Spike Lee's latest film clenches the human spirit with powerful acting 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

"25 th Il our," the latest 
pike Lee joint. poses 

the question: Can you 
ch~ngc your whole lifc in a day? 
The film answers tllis question by 
following Monty (Edward Norton) 
011 his last da y of freedom. The 
cntlre lilill takes place in the 25 
hours before Monty is taken 
lIpstate for seven years on a drug 
conviction. The fi lm's first 24 hours 
arc spenr call ing everything into 
question . "25 th f lour" presenrs an 
epiphany as hri ll iant and ~htlcki ll g 
,IS the film itself. 

II is difficult to say what is best 
about the film . The script comes 
from freshman screenwriter David 
Benioff and provides brilliant 
'Elrentino-csque dialogue through-
out. The interplay i delivered \~a :111 
ensemble ('1st comprised of some of 
Ilollywood's mos! unappreciated 
actors. Norton plays a hybrid of his 
character from "Rounders" and 
" merican Ilistory X." Whi Ie the 
fi lm doesn't show j orron going 
direction; that he hasn't gone 
bcfore, it IS difficult to think of a 
more filling actor for the part. 
Phillip cymour Iloffman and 
Barry Peppcr play orron's lung-
ti me best friends and provide some 
of the film's most movi ng 
exchanges. Rosano Dawson and 
Anna Paquin pia)' the only female 
roles. Dawson i, orron:~ girl friend. 
while Paqull1 (who is best-known as 
Rogue from "X -.\1 en ") plays a high 
school ~tudcnt amI Il offman's love 
interest, who is as provocative as shc 
is loquacious. Perhaps the mo t rec-

seen in "He Ot ,ame," through 

orton and Cox in a wholly more 
effective manner. 

Spike Lee takes this already 
brilliant concoction and infuses 
hi visceral under tanding of ew 
York to tllrn what would have 
been a great film into a master-
piece. The fi lm dcals very deliber-
ately with issues like 9/ II. racism. 
hate and empathy that most direc-
tors d,He not touch . Lee avoids 
singling anyone out in offense by 
blatamly offendll1g everyone, all 
with good rcason. Besides his 
special ability to make the taboo 
beautiful, Lec·s work III front of 
and behind the camera is as SllC-
cessful as it has always been. 

By interweaving his thcmatic 
purpose and his audiovisuals. he IS 
able to go from poignam reali.m to 
lucid dream ;equences wi thout a 
wastcd frame. Lee has never before 

so effectively toyed with his audi-
ence. Those who find themsclves 
traditionally annoyed with Lee 
films should give the director 
anothcr chance for "25th 110ur." 

Produced in part by Tobey 
Maguire (who does nor appear in 
the film), "25th 1I0ur" show Lee 
dawning the sophistication of 
Scorsese with a perspective as 
unique and fresh as it was in his 
dircctorial debut, "Do the Right 
Thll1g." Don't pass on this Spike 
Lee joint.

When Jack Russell, the 

vocalist and founder of Great 
White, left the band In 200 1 to 
pursue a solo career, the music 
world was stunned. The Southern

glam rock and had succeeded In 

selling over 6 million records was 
losing its heart and soul! But do 
not fear, because Jack Russell is 
back performing with Great lMlite 
and you can see them at 4th and 
B for a mere $20. PerJhaps most 
famous for their 1984 hit, "Once 
Bitten, Twice Shy," the band will 
give a great performance. Also

Tt tURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 200) 

Sears cup: NACDA's rule 
change is costly for Tritons 

concinued [rom page ,6 
points in women's cross COUll try, 
wOll1en's soccer and women's vol-
leyball, and those point totals were 
somewhat lower than what Triton 
fans have come to expect. 

By virtuc of winning three 
consecutivc national champi-
onships from 2000-0Z, the Triton 
women's soccer teams have earned 
100 poi ntS for each of those 
efforls and raised the bar on the 
expectations for this season. 
\"'hiJ e compiling a 15-3-1 record, 
a young Triton squad showed 
resolve and fought off nlllllerous 
injuries, but their luck ran out 
against UC Davis in the regional 
fin :ll when the Tritons fell on 
penalty kicks, earning only 53 
Directors' Cup points for their 
efforr . 

Likewise, the UCSD women's 
volleyball team was forced to face 
heightened expectations a fter an 
improbable run to the final four 
in ZOO I. The Tritons plJyed well 
all season and finished second in a 
hotly contested California 
Collegiate Athletic Associatioll 
race between UC D and Cal 
State San Bernardino. The 
Tritons were unable to overcome 
their foe, and in their third meet-
ing with UCSD in the rcgional 
scmi-final match, SUSB found 
another favorable result and elim-
inated the Tritons, but not before 
UCSD secured another 50 
Directors' Cup points.

The UCSD women's cross 
country team improved on ZOO I 's 
fourth-place finish in the CCAA 
by moving lip to third and qualify-
ing for the national champi-
onships. Lcd by All-American 
Audrey Sung, the Tritons put 
together :1 17th-place finish in 
their first-ever appearance at the 
national championships in 
Division II , which was good for 
another 39 points. 

With the hypothetical points 
from men's water polo factored in, 
UCSD would move into fourth 
place behind Grand Valley State 
and UC Davis - perennial 
Directors' Cup contenders - and 

orth Florida. 
With the below-average point 

total from the typically olltstanding 
fall season, the Tritons will have 
quite a task if they wish to come 
close to last year's third -place fin-
ish.

or not they're able to achieve the

progress, they may not only be fun 
to watch; they may slirprise some

THURSDAY 
JANUARY 9, 2003 

Champions 
still pose a 
threat in 

10th place 

o 
Owen Main 

to think. 

hen Robert I lorry ran 
his mouth over wmter 
break, I wa n't sure what 

"One thing I guarantee: Before 
the end of January, we'll be back 
above .500," Horry aid. 

Great. just what we al! needed: 
another so-called "rurning poinr" in 
the dismal Lakers' season that ha, 
fallen short of expectation and Will 
fa ll short of the pIJyoff~ without an 
acruaI sigruficanrrurnaround. 

But maybe I lorry's words, like 
hiS pl ayoff three-poi nters, came 
Just in time for the (as of j an . 7) 
I Orh-place Lakers. 

Other moments in the season 
had been cOllled "rurning pomts." 

haq 's rerum and the comeback win 
agall1st the ;\1av!> had both been 
marked as smgle momen when 
people expected the Lakers' season 
to turn around. The problem With 
that IS that eason don't rurn 
around 10 a smgle moment. Nor do 
they turn around 111 a single game, 
or even J Ml1gle week. 

WhIch IS why I lorry's prediction 
may be more rele~lInr than the other 
two moments. I f It comes true, It 
will mean the Laker, Will have 
somethlllg they've been searchlllg 
for all season: sustallled succes,. 

As of jan. 7, the Lakers had won 
four out of five games ince Horry's 
prediction. Their chedule i rela-
tively easy through January. Shaq 
Scell~ to be getti ng healthier, and 
role-players like Fisher, Fox and 
Horry are plaYIng much bener then 
they were ea rlier in the season, 

Docs any of thl mean that 
Horry's guarantee IS a sure thlllg-' 
Of course not. 

The Lakers haven't won three 
game 10 a row all year. Shaq IS still 
not completely healthy, team 
defense IS suI! a problem and thel r 
play IS sull Oat at times. 

And the three-tlmc defendlllg 
NBA champions sti ll have to go -
I III their next nme game, to real-
ize I lorry's guarantee. 

But J'm not berung agalllst them. 
I don't know If the Lakers Will do 

It, but chances are they'l! make the 
playoffs. -nlt:y proved last year that 
they don't need home-court to WIn a 
playoff scnes agamst anybody. 

The real question here IS thl 
Why have people been tallung so 
much about the Laker, Instead of 
the Mavs' spectacular sea~on thus 
far, or the Kings' relauvel y qUiet 
and ~ teady reign at the top of the 

We~ tern Conference standlllgs' 
The amwcr IS that other tealll~, 
a~ well a~ fans and the media, know 
that the Lake r~ are champlon~ . 
They have been the best team 111 
the league for three-straight year 
and people know that the road to 
the challiplollShlp will probably 
~ lIlI go through them. That 1\, If 
they manage to make the playoff: 

If they don't, there'~ Jlway~ the 
draft lottery. I heard there's a high

UPDATE 

o 

Trying to reach for the cup 
UCSD down in new Sears Cup standings 

U C 0 is ued for I o. 14 nationally III the most current Division II ea r~ Directors' Cup standings fol-
lowing a strong fall season, but a rule 
change that takes effecl for the first time 
thi year co t the Tritons points that would 
have vaulted them IntO fourth place. 

The Director' Cup I~ overseen by the 
ation:!1 AsSOCiation of Collegiate 

Olrect<Jrs of Athleucs, and it is awarded to 
the strongest all-around athletic program at 
the DI\'ision J, DiviSIOn II, Di\~sion 11J and 

ational Association of J ntercollegiate 
Athleocs levels. Points are accumulated by 
schools when their respective teams reach 
the national playoffs, With 100 points 
awarded to the nauonal champion and a 
ubsequently decreaslI1g amount given to 

each runner-up. Official standings are 
released at th e end of the fall , winter alld 
spnng seasons. 

Tlus year, what was arguably U D's 
stronge 't performance from the fall season 
Will go unrewarded in the Directors' Cup 
standings. The Triton men's water polo 
team finished fourth nationally while COIl1-
peting against primarily Division I teams, 
but a ACDA rule change will prevent 
UC 0 from receiving the 83 points they 
would have earned. The new rule tates that 
points will not be awarded in sports where 
there are les than 12 teams in the champi-
onship fi eld. This affects a wide range of 
sports, most notably men's and women's 
water polo, which each have a champi -
onship field of four and are sports in which 
UC 0 has traditionally excelled. 

U 0 u ually scores the majority of its 
points for the year in the fall cason. This 
year, however, the Tritons only picked up

Coming off a conference title and a 
fourth-place fini sh in the Divi ' lon II 
national champion~hips last year, the 
UCSO women 's SWimming and diving 
tcam is looking for another strong finish 
to its se3 on this year. Led by captain 
jennifer \Varanabe .II1t! star brea~tstrokc 
sWimmers junior Deni se Bogard Jnd 
sophomore Rosan na D e lurg-io, it seem, 
like thi goal won't be too hard to 
achieve. 

The swim tC,lm isn't JUSt about 
champion hips and recording- the be t 
time though , and for being an illlhvitIual 
sport, the swimmers de cnbe their tea III 
as a very tightly knit cO llllllunlty. 

" \\'Imming is unique becJuse YO LI 
spend so much time together \1 Ith your 
teammate, they reall), become your fam-
ily," said Watanabe, who holds 10 school 
peed records. 

Despite placll1g first or ~ccond III IX

"Our goal right nuw I ~ to heat LISt) 
and win conference agalll thiS year," 
Watanabe said. 

Bogard, part of the team's one-two 
punch in the lOa brea t troke, is current-
ly ranked No. 36 nationally. She is also 
coming off excellent finishes both in last 
year's national , where she placed ~ixth, 
and this year's Spcedo Cup, II here ~ he 
placed second behind tcallllllate Delurglo 
in the 100 breaststrokc. 

"Rosanna and I arc prcny good tea m-
mates; we practice together, and it's u,u-

would like to Will the next race, but 
either way I hope we fini sh one-two."
