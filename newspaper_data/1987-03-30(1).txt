ceremony at the Wall by readmg a 
name aloud. The group waits a 
moment, and thl n another student 
read a second name. Before a 
third name IS announced, several 
people In the group begin to cry. 
And b) the time the entire list of 
about 20 names is completed, 
nearly everyone is in tears. 

The names were of relatives and 
friends of students in the class. 
Somc of the students were unable 
to make the trip, but they 
submitted thcse names to be 
remembered at the Wall. 

Members of the group have 
come for different reasons. Some of 
their parents fought in the war and 
some prote ted against it. Some 
died in Vietnam and others didn't 
get Involved at all.

SACRAME NTO, UC Wlrc- In a n effon to figh t "a virtual epidemic 
o f acquaintance ra pe," Assemblymember Tom Hayden yesterday 
unveiled twO bilb urging Caltfo rnia's c lieges and unive rsities to 
make p rotection aga inst rape a more sen ous cam pus priority. 

Among other thlflgs, Hayden 'S Assembly Concurre nt Resolution 
46 and Assembly Bill 201 7 would require unive rsities to create 
mandatory rape education programs for all freshme n, donn 
residents and fraternity and sorority membe rs. 

If approved by the legi slature and Signed by Gov. Deukmejian, 
they wo uld also tiffen penalties against student rapi sts and require 
colleges and universities to "publiCize and enforce penalties, 
including suspension or expulsion, for persons found to have 
committcd an act of rape." 

According to a recent survey by a Kent State psychologist, one in 
eight college women have been raped . Hayden, D-Santa Monica, 
said during a press conference yesterday. 

Last year, there were 16 reported rapes and 13 attempted rapes . 
on the nine University of California campuses, according to 
statistics from the UC Office of the President. 

Hayden , however. called the ligures misleading because "more 
than 90 percent of the victims did not reporr rhe c rime to the police . 

"ApprOXimately 85 pe rcent of these cases were acquaintance or 
so-called 'date' rapes," he sa id . "Threc-qual1ers of the victims said 
that they dId nor know they had experienced a crime and few of the 
males thought they had commined a crime. 

"Thi s indIcates an appalling lack of understanding of rape that 
requires mandatory (edu atlonal forums)," Hayden said . 

In the past, thc univerSity has been inscnsitive to rape victims, he 
said . "That's changing now, but the university still hasa long way to 
go. [These bills] will accelerate lhat process by which universities 
and collcges become sensitive to the problem." 

In addition , the measures would establish a "victim's bill of 
rights" lhat would givc the victim a say about proposed penalties 
and "prevent (his or her) personal sexual history from being a part 
of the proceedings. 

According to UC Riverside studcnt Jennifer Balogh, who has 
worked at the UCR women's center for two ycars, there is currently 
no official UC policy to handle acquaintance rape. 

If Hayden's bill resu lted in such a policy, "you'd sec reporting of 
acquaintancc rape become much higher: shesaid during the p ress 
conference. 

The bill also drew sup art from Dave Golden, who heads thc 
Interfraterniry Council at Cali fornia State University Chico. 

"[The measuresl will heigh ten awareness of the problem. We 
need to emphasize that (acquaintance rape) is a crime .. . and 
inform victims of their rights," he said during the press conference.

Questions raised of Third dean selection 
By JAMES PINPIN 

T HIRD College 's search process for a new dean is being charged by Third 
College Alumni Association 
representative Andy Schneider as 
being biased . 

According to Schneider, the 
process to nil the vacancy caused 
by Ms. Beverly Varga's termination 
is not merely a formality, but also 
serving the ulterior motives of 
somc individuals. 

"The process to pick the 
successor is in a way where people 
who are involved in the polities of 
her removal are now going to 
benefit on her replacement," 
Schneider said . 

At this stage of the process, the 
search has been left to a screening 
committee headed by Dr. Sheldon 
Schultz. Thc committec members, 
who were appointed by Third 
Collegc Provost Faustina Solis and 
Vice-Chanccllor Joseph Watson. 
are Dr. John Stewart (Council of 
Provosts). Dr. Harriet March 
(Council of College Deans) 
Yolanda Trevino (Third College 
staff). Nicholas Fajardo, Rose 
Sandro, Mary Moralcs, Erik Basil 
and Rex Vaughn. 

As Schultz explained, the 
committee's purpose is to choose 
the top three candidates out of 
approximately 250 applicants with 
the undcrstandi ng that any of the 
three would be an excellent choice 
of dean. At thc moment, the 
committee is involved in reducing 
the 250 applicants to a more 
manageable 25 . After the 

reduction , the committee will rcad 
all the files of the chosen 25, 
interview them, and decide on the 
top thrce. Schultz stresed that the 
final decision on who the dcan will 
be is not thcir responsibility. 
Provost Solis holds tha t final 
decision. 

"Alumni throughout the country 
arc extremely concerncd about 
having alumni reprcsentation on 
the committee ," Schncider said. 
Zephyr Goldsmith, the East Coast 
rep resentative of the Third Collegc 
Alumni Association , has sent a 
fo r mal request for a lumni 
pa rtici pa tion. Accord i ng to 
Schneidcr, the univcrsity has not 
replicd to their request. 

"The alumni is eoncerncd that a 
game is going on here . On one 
hand, the university says, 'we want 
you to participate: buton the other 
hand, they do not allow us to 
participate on the committee to 
select the new dean ," Schneider 
said. "We are extremely concerned 
that thc un iversity has some strong 
ulterior motivcs on controlling who 
the new dean is goi ng to be be ." 

Schneider also pointed out that 
Nicholas Aguilar, who was deeply 
involved in Ms . Varga ' s 
termination, is o n the committee to 
choose her successor. 

Vice-Chancellor Watson and 
acting Third College Dean, Hugh 
Pates, both affirmed tha t it is not 
standa rd procedure to allow 
alumni participation in such 
committees. "We have nor had 
them in the past, and we did not 

see any compelling reasons to do it 
in th is ci rcumstanCC," Watson 
said. Pates also added that he is not 
sure whether a majority of the 
alumni association do want to have 
alumni representation in the 
screening committee . Hc 
commentcd that it is possible that 
only a minority are acting on their 
own initiativc towards an alumni 
representation. 

Schneider also criticized the ad 
used to invite applicants for the 
deanship. "The ad docs not make 
it c1car that Third College is 
looking for a minority individual to 
head up the collcge , If we don't 
have a good numbcr of minorities, 
it raises thc question of the 
university's commitment to 
mai n taining its minority 
commitment to Third College," 
Schneider said. He commented 
that thc ad did not evcn say equal 
opportunity or affirmative action, 
just acronyms (EOE/ M ) at the 
boltom of the ad. He added that 
the job description in the ad did 
not deseribe the things that the 
dean of Third College has been 
doing, which concerns the 
training of minority Icaders and 
which requires experiences in 
multi-cultural se ttings. "It's just a 
blatant case of institutional racial 
d iscrimination ," Schneider said . 

"The judgment was to write the 
ad as it was," Watson said . He 
added that the reason why there 
was no miniority emphasis is due 
to their goal of attracting the best 
applicants regardless of cultural 

background . "You can 't have 
experience with students in any 
American college without having 
experience with a wide range of 
students , including minority 
students:' Watson said . 

In intervicws with two Third 
College students, who wished to 
remall1 anonymous, and one being 

a member of the sc reening 
committee , the concensus was that 
it is not necessary for the newdean 
to be a minority individual for the 
person to be qualified . 'Just 
bccause of a person's nationality or 
race doesn't mean they do or do 
not have concerns about

Reagan's third act 
By PETER QUERelA 

Snickers and bughter followed 
President Reagan's question to 
reporters gathered in the White 
House Press Room last month 
when he asked: "Everybody who 
can remem;::c;- what they were 
doing on August 8, 1985 raise your 
hands. I think it's possible to 
forget ," the Pre ident said , barely 
able to contain himself from fits of 
laughter. 

That, of course, was the 
infamous day the PreSident 
approved shipments of deadly 
weapons to our avowed enemy the 
Ayatollah Khomeni a a ransom, 
not for the release of aU the 
hostages in Iran held captive, as is 
generally believed, but for the 
release of one man, Wilham 
Buckley, the el.A. bureau chief 
abducted in Beirut twO years 
earlier. The Ayatollah's master 
torturers and in terrogators 
succeeded in picking from 
Buckley's brain a wealth of 
invaluable information regarding 
the C.I.A. operations throughout 
the Middle East. 

These limes, it "ppe(.1r~ , arc lar 
more penlous th(.1n even the mo t 
astute and can clentlous observer 
of nallonal and II1ternational 
events ever realized. 

Indeed , we live 111 an age where a 
outh Carolina beauty queen 

known as Vanna Whi re, the 
renown lerrer turner on "Wheel of 
Fortune," cams more 111 salary and 
gratuities than the Pre ident of the 
United tates. Game show 
produ er Merv Griffin 111 the 
March 6 edition of "Nightline" 
happily boasted that 'The Wheel" 
last year cost a mere 'i>7 million to 
produce, yet grossed over $105 
million. In some markets, 111 fact, 
'The Wheel" gets higher ratings 
than the viewership of all three 
major television networks' nightly 
news shows combined. Because of 
this, CBS is in the process of firi ng

Morrow is rolling in his grave. 

But then it was only in this 
decade that the electorate -
comprised of an ever shrinking 

pool of reg istered and 
participating vOlers - twice gave a 
medio re B-Grade movie ac tor the 
authOrity to Sit in the most 
powerful position on earth. This is 
a man who runs the federal 
government much like Mr. Anhur 
Carlson (Gordon jump) ma nages 
the ficticious rad io station on 
"WKRP in Cmci nnati." In a 
harmless comedy sitcom, the 
scenario is hilarious. In real li fe 
presidency, such reality is pa theti 
and intolerable. 

Ronald Reagan, on th e day 
follOwing this na tionwide 12-
minute TV "apology" of Marc h 4 
promised a cheering crowd of right 
wi ng supporters that a good actor 
always saves a surprise for the 
"third act." Perhaps the president 
wi ll pull another Grenada, Libya, or 
worse , another Be irut fiasco, like 
the one which killed 241 sleeping 
ma rines in 1983, out of his bag of 
tricks. 

Whatever his plans are , let us aU 
beware of Reagan's "Third Act." It 
might knoc k a 101 of people dead.

I've been humiliated at the 

UCSD bookstore checkout lanes, 
discredited in the credit ofTice and 
now - the final blow - my spring 
registration was put on hold by the 
Student Loan Office. 

And for what heinous crime? I 
marned a very nice man named 
Brown and adopted his aU-too-
common last name. It's made the 

past couple of years tough . Many 
times I've wished I could have 
peered into my future at UCSD, so I 
could have changed my name to 
something like Zprkvmwgpw 
before applying. 

Still, how could 1 have foreseen 
the problem? In the 17 years I've 
been mamed, thiS is the first time 
I've been confused with any low-
life, debt-ridden, check-bouncing 
Patricia Brown. Seems like banks, 
department stores, credit card 
companies and the mynad OIher 
places one deals with m the course 
of adult hfe have some mysteriOUS 
method of distingUishing me from 
those OIhers. 

But not UCSD. Here I'm at the 
top of the 10 Most Wanted List, in 
spite of having a different middle 
name, a different address, a 
different social security number 
and a different student 
identification number, not to

Although I've never had a check 

returned for insufTtcle nt funds in 
my whole life, when I try to pay for 
books with a check at the UCSD 
bookstore, I'm viewed suspicious-
ly, and made to wait while the clerk 
goes th ro ug h a th oro ugh 
investigation of who knows what. 
Meanwhile , people 111 line behind

who's hold ing them up. 

My credit rating is impeccable 
and I pay my bills on time, but 
when I write a check fo r my 
registration fees, they take one 
quick look at the Signature and act 
as if I'm trying to pull a fast one. 

Now it's the loan office. The only 
loan I'm involved with is the one 
for our house, which we've owned 
for the past 10 years, and whic h is

"Whenever you feel like 
smokln' a Cigarette, Instead of

the band-the ' Larry Hagman

Get one free from your 
American Cancer SOCiety." 

It is written that whenever He 
gets around to it, God will return to 
Earth and judge everyone in 
accordance to what they had done. 
The possibility of such an event 
occuring has often assisted in 
preventing people from doing 
nasty things to one another and is 
the basis of most religions. 
Judgement Day had always seemed 
to be something in the distant 
future , however, and I was truly 
surprised when I found myself 
face-to-face with my creator while 
enduring a par ' ~ rly slow-
moving Interstate .raffic jam. 

There are two special words that 
every American utters when faced 
with unavoidable and potentially 
painful situations. While an angel 
led me into a huge cathedral-like 
palace" decorated in the customary 
gold and white motif, I decided 
against this natural reaction after 

considering the circumstances 
and realizing that Hell was 
probably a good ten minutes away. 
Desperate, I began the standard 
supplicating routi ne, but was 
quickly silenced by one of the 
higher-ranking angels and told 
that I was not to bejudged ,norwas 
I even dead. I had been selected for 
jury duty on a judgement day. 

Jury duty is a much more 
pleasant experience in Heaven 
than on Earth . It is arranged so 
that one does not lose even a 
minute to the process. Since the 
passage of time on earth is run bya 
cemral accounting office in 
Heaven, I was credited for the 
amount of Earth time spent in 
Heaven and promised that I would 
be returned to the same point in 
time from which [ was abducted.

not fi nanced by UCSD, Yet my 
spring 1987 registration was 
placed on hold by the loan office. 
When I called to say they made a 
mi stake, I was shifted from one 
person to another, each of whom 
immediately put me on hold long 
enough to make me simmer. Afte r 
about 20 minutes of this, [ was 
fi naUy told I would have to come 
into the office. I protested, to no 
ava il , that this was their mistake, 
not mine, so why should I have to 
pay th e consequences. 

But bureaucracy always wins. It 
appears I have no choice: I f I want 
to be enrolled for spring quarte r, [ 
must allow them to take up my 
scarcely avai lable free time and 
ra ise my blood pressure to 
dangerous heights. Hey, students 
have nothing better to do, right? 
The administration makes the 
mistake, but I have to pay for it. I 
have to play b)' their rules, Once 
agai n, students don't coum at 
UCSD. 

And what's next in this horror 
story? I fu lly expect to be collared, 
handcuffed and dragged away at 
my graduation ceremony. Or, if I 
manage to sneak th ro ugh 
somehow, I'm sure they'll send out 
a man to repossess my diploma.

After a brief explanation of the

According to Nelson , an elderly 
angel, minia ture Judgement Days 
are held roughly twice a year, or 
whenever the Old Man feels like it. 
Sometimes, when there is a big 
di saster on Earth , a special 
j udgement Day is caUed. During 
these eve nts, several thousand 
jurors are selected and abducted, 

G 

and on the big day all the dead who 
haven ' t re con ci led t heir 
differences with the Almighty in 
others ways are thawed out and 
tried. God is a pretty lenient guy, 
but one of his stipula tions is [0 
judge people in the same way they 
themselves had judged others. 
Needless to say it has a positive 
moral effect on the jurors returning 
to Earth . 

This . j udgement Day wa s 
somewhat unique, The first round 
of defendants to be arraigned 
were known as 'sou r preachers: or 
men who abused God's name for 
fi nancial gains or otherwise. I had 
a suspicion about who would be 
tried , since a particularly posh area

in a cell across from the jury, An

Judge'S desk and began entering 
some information.

ment for each of these phonics." 

"Call Mr. and Mrs. Bakker to the

Bakker. who looked like Dan 
Akroyd's impersonation of Jimmy 
Carter when he grinned. and his 

wife. who remtnded me of a son of

the best of spints as the bailiff lOre 
a 's in shee t' from the terminal that 
was weU over fifty pages long and 
handed it to the Judge. 

God scratched his white beard 
while reading the charges. "You 
have had quite a checkered past. 
Mr. Bakker. It stans with Girl SCOUt 
Cookie theft at age three and it's 
downhill from there . Looks like we

crimes is that of abUSing my name 
to serve your own personal 
interests. I see here that you have 
purchased for me . WIth fund s 
given in earnest by my followers . 
an amusement park. a Palm 
Springs mansion . and a somewhat 
loose-lipped lady of the evening." 

"Mrs. Bakker. besides your 
preSCription cocaine addiction ., 
you are charged with aiding and 
abetting this charlatan and using 
enough makeup to paintthe Grand 
Canyon." 

"Jurors . please think of a suitable 
sentence for these two confidence 
people .. . Thank you. For you. 
Tammy. fifty years in Yuppie Hell . 
Jim . you are to be employed here 

for eternity as Truman Capote's 
personal servant. Next case .. " 

The baihff pulled a lever and a 
trap door under Jim and Tammy 
dropped them from sight. 

"Call Mr. Jerry Falwell and Mr. 
Jimmy Swaggan to the stand." 
proclaimed the bailiff. 

Falwell approached the bench . 
trying to appear as regal as God 
himself. The bailiff went to work on 
the computer. and handed a sin 
sheet nearly two inches thick to the 
Judge . 

"You're worse than anyofthem ." 
muttered the Lord . "But in your

were tempted the same way Eve 
was. 

"Since Mr. Falwell and Mr. 
Swaggan are opposed to 'cnminal's 
rights: we will di:;pense WIth the 
trial and simply pass sentence," the 
Judge continued. "If the jury would 
be so kind .. . Thank yo u." 

"Both o f you are to return to the 
world you have always dreamed of. 
You, Falwell, will be reborn in a 
poveny-stricken black family in ' 
Georgia and will be forced to try to 
extract an education from an elitist 
'separalC-but-equal' school system . 
and live on a meager welfare check 
from a government who is too 
obsessed with an impending 
Soviet invasion to care for its own 
citizens. You, Swaggan, will be 
locked in a ceO for eternity with 
three Perry Como albums and a 

' phonograph . Never again will the 
Devil's music touch your cars." The 
trap door opened and the two 
pleading preachers disappeared. 

The bailiff called Oral Roberts to 
the stand and handed over a 
substantial sin sheet to the Jud~. 

"Welcome home: cttuqdc:d the 
Lord. "You didn't fool me with that 
phony check to yourself. You wem 
ahead and made a deal with me 
and the people didn't buy it 
Problem was, I decided to accept 
and hold up my end of the bargain. 
I must admit, Oral , that you are at 
least the most entenaining, if not 
the most deceitful, of the phony 
tclepreachers. You fleeced the 
public well and have used the 
funds to build monuments to 
yourself, hospitals that were not 
need ed, sc hools that required a 
certain height and weight to gain 
admission , 'Prayer Towers: and aD 
sorts of other useless c rap, nO( to 
mention a healthy take-home 
check with which you bought aD 
sorts of propcny and possessions. 
You should have known that using 
a 9OO-foot Jesus to scare your 
followers into writing checks was a 
no-no, as was vowing you would 
find the cure for cancer. And those 
phony healing shows d idn't do me 
any good either." 

"If the jury would agree on a 
suitable punishment ... Thank 
you. This is more your doing than 
mine, Oral. You are hereby ordered 
to return to Eanh. However, you 
will be placed on a commission 
basis. All your propeny will be 
Iiquified. You will place eight 
million dollars a month in a 
deSignated location, where it will 
be taken from you and given to 
those who need it. If you fail ·to 
meet this goal you wi ll be banished 
to Yuppie Hell for eternity and a 
day.". •

The committee deleted the

originally wanted to s pend 
$500,000 to implement p1-oposals 
contained in the Smelser Report, a 
university effort to identify ways to 
reform U.c. curriculum and 
programs. 

Democratic leaders want to hold 
full floor debate "to bring these 
deletions to the light of day, where 
they can be fully viewed and 
understood by the public ," 
Vaseoncellos said . Major policy 
issues in the budget sc heduled for 
full debate on the Assembly floor 
includes: 1) MediCal reform - the 
govern or 's proposed budget 
reduced state General Fund 
support for MediCal by $150 
million ; 2) K-12 education -
saying they were wasteful or 
obsolete, Deukmejian eliminated 
several special education programs 
and used the approximately $217 
million saved to reduce class size. 
The governor's budget saves $8 
million by eliminating the 
California Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration. The federal 
OSHA would be to perform Cal 
OSHA'S responSibilities of

The course will attempt to study the nature and significance of these relations, 
which up to that time were the most extensive with that part of the world. The 
course will cover such topics as: articles of commerce exchanged, trade routes and 
ports of call, identity of the merchants engaged in this trade, the hazards to which

Sudden enrollment increases 
[n 1984, enrollment for the class 

began to shoot up. Since it was 
created in 1979, the class size has 
doubled each year until it reached 
its present maximum capaci ty. 

But Capps and students say the 
class' popularity is more than just a 
fad . Though the war officially 
ended in 1975, they say the 
fighting is not ove r yet . and it is up 
to their generation to resolve the 
issue . 

"This class has been emotionally 
draining on me," says UCSBse nior 
Kim Alexander. "\t 's caused me a 
lot of stress ,. I think about it 
constantly." 

"This class isn't about the war,

"The people that went to the war 
are still in our society. They are still

Alexander says, pOinting out the 
more than 100,000 suicides by 
Vietnam veterans since the end 'of

"There is often some impact on 
the students' personal lives. What

Students say the class is nO! only 
a lesson about war, but a lesson 
about life. "I know this sound s 
corny, but I've really grown in this 
class," senior Steve Vi ncent says. 

Movies ranging from "Platoon" 
to "Rambo" have sparked a 
renewed interest in the Vie tnam 
War, and for many college 
students, this represents their first 
exposure to the infrequently 
discussed war.

WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO 
CAlL YOUR PARENTS? 
a) When you're stuck in your room because 

someone "pennied" your door. 

b) When you spent all your money playing 
video games and you still have to buy books 
for Developmental Psych. 

c) When you iust miss hearing their voices 
and telling them what you've been doing. 

One thing about parents: they love to hear what you've been up to. 
But you should call them anyway. 
And when they ask where you were last night, tell them that you 

always call using AT&T Long Distance Service because of 
AT&T's high quality 'ervice and exceptional 
value. 

When they ask how your stud-
ies are going, remind them that 
AT&T gives you immediate 
credit if you dial a wrong 
number. 

And when they ask about 
your plans for the weekend, note 
that you can count on AT&T for 
clea r long distance connections. 
~ And when, at last, they praise 

you for llsing AT&T, then-and only 
then-you might want to mention those

popularity of the course is the lack 
of infonnation students have 
received concerning the war. 
"America just wanted 10 forget 
about the war when we were 
young," Meyers explains. 

Met with relative silence from an 
older generation that did not want 
to ta lk about the war, students 
today are eager to learn the fa ts 
and angry that their education 
failed to properly inform them . 

"They're SOrt of startled at first , 
Goodell explains. -ThiS generation 
only caught a hint of what went on. 
And now they want the facts. Many 
of them are rediscove ringrhatera. I 
think It brings au! that it isn't 
fini shed yet. Society isn't finished 
dealing with the war." 

She is pleased this -rediscovery" 
mcludes many aspects of the war 
that had been previous ly 
neglec tcd. Students' research 
papers this quarter include IOpics 
such as the war's impact on the 
Vietnamese people and culture, 
the rolc of women and minorities 
in the war, and the healing process 
for the future . 

Students remember little about 
war 

As the children of the Vietnam 
generation , th ese s tudents 
themselves remember little about 
war. 

When th e first American 
serviceman was kiled by North 
Vietnamese troops in 1959, Osaki 
was not even born . One of her first 
memories concern ing Vietnam 
was of the controversy over the 
refugees. 

"\ asked my Mom why \ didn't 
remember anything. She said we 
just didn't watch anything about it 
on TV. She wasn't into that kind of 
stuff ... so \ never learned anything 
about it," she says. 

After the Tet offensive of 1968, 
as Americans were learning that 
perhaps the war was a disastrous 
mistake, Vincent was learning to 
say the alphabet in kindergarten . 

Vincent remembers seeing body 
counts on the news and the war 
consisted of a short paragraph in a 
modem hismry book. 

"So you've got people at college 
righ t now who are asking, 'What 
the hell went on?'" he says.

Although Capps agrees that 
yo ung people today were unfairly 
protected from hearing about the 
war by an older generation unable 
to agree on what happened, he still 
puts his faith In tOday's students to 
resolve the lingering problems 
about Vietnam . 

"Students don't carry the same 
conflict about the war," he says. 
"Now it's a reconstruction period 
and it's time to put the pieces hack

course is healing." 

For the students in the class, the 
trip to the Wall represe nts the 
culmination of 10 weeks at their 
own kind of "boot camp." After an 
emotional quarter listening to vets' 
stories and discovenng the traged y 
of Vietnam, the students are 
looking to the Wall to gIve them a 
sense of resolution.

The memonal is not for the 
soldiers of the war, he says, but for 
those left behind. 

Students reaCI to the Wall 
For senior Joe Mazzocco, it was 

the descent down the path 10 the 
apex of the Wall that struck him. 
The first few panels of the Wall are 
at foot level, but as it cuts into the 
earth , it creates a trench until the 
monument is several feet above the 
viewer's head . 

"We started walking down and 
we couldn't say anything. It's like 
you enter another world," he says, 
describing how the street and 
surrounding building disappear 
from view. "You're isolated from 
everything else and that's all that 
there is." 

"[ don't think I've fclt emotion 
like that before," Mazzocco says. 

Students say they were confused 
and surprised by their own 

reactions. -There 'was no one there 
[ was grieving for , and yet [ felt so 
sad," Osaki says. 

Senior Jennifer Karson was also 
impressed by the walk down to the 
center of the Wall. "You sort of sink 
in to a level where the names start 
to rise up to you. You're confronted 
with a whole wall of men's names. 
You're just confronted with it, and 
the reality hits you." 

She remembers most of the 
Amencan sounding names. "[t felt 
so close to home. These guys could 
have lived on my floor freshman 
year." 

At the Watt , Karson shakes her 
head and begins to cry. "[t'S too bad 
lives aren ' t as stable as 
monuments. " 

For Alexander, it wasn't until she 
read a name that was the same as 
her boyfriend's that she broke 
down. "That was when I began to 
understand the grief that other 

people must have felt." 
Capps also found his name on 

the Wall and left a single red 
carnation against the marble. 

For two members of the group, 
the trip to the memorial was 
particularly significant. Jim Garrett 
and Mike Madrid arc Vietnam 
veterans taking pan in the class. 

Garrett's trip was paid for by 
students in the class, who passed 
around a helmet to collect money, 
enabling the veteran to see the 
WaIL 

"[ didn't expect to be as touched 
as I was," Gart'ctt says. He Visited 
the Wall early in the morning, 
before the group was scheduled to 
meet, in order to spend some time 
alone. He found the name of his 
beSt friend , killed in the war. 

Beginning of healing process 
Though their trip to the Wall 

evoked strong emotions, students 

Monday, March 30, J987 15 

believe the pilgrimage helped them 
confront the "unfinished" aspects 
of the war. 

"Seeing the wall was like the 
beginning of a healing process," 
Alexander explains. "[t was the 
culmination of a lot of feclings. [t 
was the high paint. And now it's 
like we're going through the 
healing process ourselves. We 
have been exposed to these 
horrible wounds of our country 
and now we have to try and heal 
them." 

For Karson , it was an outlet to 
express the feelings stirred in her 
by the class. "It gave a direction 
and a meaning to everything. The 
emotions finally came out. I felt like 
something was finally resolved ." 

She wrote in her diary that day, 
"Today I went to the WalL [ feel like 
I've been there already for 10 
weeks. I felt the healing for the first 
time .. . a peace came."

Calling it y-our own 
Free entrepreneural class at UCSD 
By TRISH BROWN, Staff Writer 

Entrepreneur. A few shon years 
ago, most of us didn't even know 
how to pronounce rhe word, much 
less think we wanted to become 
one. Bur today the term is 
ubiquitous; everyone can say it, we 
all know what it means, and we'd 
like to get in on some of me hottest 
money-making prospects around. 

Barbara Bry , program 
coordinator of CONNECT, the 
UCSD program in Technology and 
Entrepreneurship, pointed out 
rhat rhis wasn 't always the case. 
When Bry graduated from Harvard 
Busll1ess School 10 years ago, 
going to work for big companies 
was the trend. But a([er recently 
returning 10 Harvard for her tenth 
reunion , she found large 
corporations to be pasS<!. ''The 
people everybody wanted to talk to 
were the ones who had staned 
rheir own compal1lcs," she said. 
"Ir's become the ming 10 do." 

During me past two years , 
CONNECT has sponsored lectures 
and seminars geared primarily 
towards the business community, 
with top-notch entrepreneurs such 
as Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, 
and John Naisbiu, aurhor of 
Megatrends. 

Now me first major dfon 10 
allract UCSD students 10 the 
CONNECT program - a non-
credit seminar called "How to 
Successfully Start a New 
Enterprise" - is being offered, 

beginning April L Regularly $145, 
the course is free to UCSD students 
and will meet Wednesdays from 4-
6 pm through May 20. According 10 
Bry, students' initial response 10 
rhe course offering has been 
enthusiastic. Not only have people 
flocked to enroll, bur "I've talked 
with students who can'r take it thiS 
time and want to know when we'll 
be dOing JI again ," she said. 

R.B. 'Buzz' Woolley,Jr. will teach 
the entrepreneurial class. Woolley 

Guardi"" file photo 
"We 'll analyze how to be 
opportunistic, how to think in an 
entrepreneurial manner." 

- A.B. Wooley, president 

is preSident of Girard Capital, Inc., 
a San Diego vcnturc capital firm 
known for invesring a wide range 
of businesses; II1cluding sofrware , 
artifical intelligence and electronic 
components, as well as nored for 
irs early backing of Cipher Data 
Products, Inc . Woolley IS also 
ehalrma!) of Girard Savings Bank, 
and a successful real estate 
developer. 

A low-key man with a sense of 
humor and a big laugh , Woolley 
c;Jutions mat, despite me mle , the 
course will not teach anyone 
exactly how 10 become an 
entrepreneur. 'There aren 'r any 
absolurcs in entrepreneurship, so I 
can't get up and just tell everybody 
this is exactly the way ro do it," 
Woolley said. Instead, rhe class will 
emphasize learning how to think 
like an entrepreneur. "We'll 
analyze how to be opportunistic , 
how to think in an entrepreneural 
manner," Woolley said. 

An important part of the 
curriculum IS a business plan that 
each student will draw up - one 
element Woolley believes essential 
10 a successful business. The plan 
will be cririqued by both Woolley 
and other class members. 

Students learn as much from 
their mistakes as from their smash 
hits, Woolley said. He believes that 
a lor of success is due ro luck. "And 
I have a luck slOry on me other 
side," he added, relating the sad

Impact on the practice of an-making and on early modem society as a whole, antiCipating by several centuries the development of mass 
culture in our own age. The graphic work of Albrecht Durer, a major figure of the Renaissance and one of the great printmakers in the 
hiStory of art, illustrates how pnnts for the first time brought visual imagery to a broad audience panicularly subject matter new to the ~sual 
arts rclaung to social. political, and religious changes of the early sixteenth century. The course will also cover severallaterdevclopments in 
pnntmaktng (for example , the emergence of the popular press in the late eighteenth century) which illustrate how issues raised by the

the romantic classicism of Boullee's visionary sehemes to the pragmatism of mid-nineteenth century innovations. The explicit use of new 
materials and technology produced such dazzling structures as London's Crystal Palace of 1850·51; political concerns shaped the city 
plans of Paris and Vienna From JacqueS-louiS David's images of Revolution and of Empire through Goya's dissonant revelations of 
human irrationahty, an moved toward the realism of subject and handling of Courbet and Maner.

sailboats available. "In 1986 we 

took in over a million and a half 
dollars' worth of boats, and now we 
have a growing program ," Don 
Raidt, the founder and operator of 
CUS1, said . 

Raidt explained that CUSI was 
formed to "accept the risks of boat 
ownership and simply donate the 
use of the boats to the University, 
which is exactly how we operate 
today. We became incorporated • 
May 29. 1984. 

"Whether [peoplel prefer to 
cruise, to take leisurely weekends 
in Catalina, or whether they intend 
to get out and learn racing on larger 
boats, we have courses," Raidt said. 
The introductory courses in Big 
Boat Sailing, Racing and 
Navigation will be offered this 
spring through Canyon view 
Recreation Depanmcnt for modest 
fees . These facilities will be open to 
the public as well as the students. 

PrereqUiSites for the introduc· 
tOry courses are few, "I don't think 
that people need to worry about 
experience; Just join in ," Raldt 
said. 

With many high skilled 
computer operatOrs and engineers 
from the University community 
working with him on boat design 
and other technical aspects of 
sailing, Raidt sees few limits on the 
potential of the program. "At the 
end of Chris Dickson's challenge 
(New Zealand's skipper in the 
America's Cup races), he said in a

tale of a company he was involved 
Mth that came out with the first 
word processor. Although he was 
convinced future prospects for 
word processing looked fantastic , 
the company went out of business. 
"My timing was five years too 
early," he said . "So that's why I say 
it (success) is not a scientific type 
of thing." 

Guest speakers for the course 
will include successful entrepre-
neurs with varied areas of 
expertise , from computers to 
biotechnology, banking and real 
estate.

"Iii ke to race; I h ke to cruise; but 
I like to see people sa il properly," 
Raidt said seriously. A large part of 
the philosophy behind the CUSI is 
to "bUllc;l a world class sailing 
ce nter right here in San Diego" by 

"We want people to 
come and take intro-
ductory courses with 
us so that by summer-
time we can all be 
sailing together." 

gettin!', together the right materials, 
the right technology and the right 
people, according to Raidt. 

Ra idt's sailing experience is 
impressive. "I've been sailing si nce 
1943, and I made my first trip to 
Catalll1a in 1957 - that's pretty 
amazing in view of the fact that I'm 
only 21," joked the grey-haired 
Raidt. His years of experience 
certainly haven't diminished his 
enthusiasm for sailing; in fact, he 
remains active in virtually every 
aspeCt of the sport, from racing to 
cruiSing to teaching sailing classes 
here 111 San Diego. 

Today, the classes and other 
activi[les of CUSI are taki ng off in a 
successful way. One of (he latest 
developments is the formation of a 
new yacht club. This is especiaUy 
important for the racing program, 
since most races requl re boats 
entenng to be representing a yacht 
club. "Once we get 100 members, 
we 're going to suhmit our 
applilatlon to th e Southern 
Cahfol,lla Yachting A~sociation ,

New Quarter brings return of stars 

UCSD gets spring break 
By CHARLES TABESH, Interim Sporrs Editor 

I STEAD of hining a baseball last quarter, twO of the Tritons' best players were 
hitting the books. After being 
declared academically ineligible, 
outfielders Gary Fessia and Jim 

icolaisen were forced to study 
while their teammates were 
guiding UCSD to a top-ten ranking 
in Division Ill. 

But with the end of winter 
quarter came an end to their 
academic exile . 

"It was very frustrating," Fessia 
said of watching the first half of the 
season pass by. And although 
UCSD was doing fine without 
them , It is obvious that Fessla and 

icolalsen are important pans of 
the Triton machine. While the rest 
of us were on vacation , they were 
poundmg opposing pitchers. 

UCSD won four of its five games 
last week, as icolaisen went 5 for 

15 with six runs scored and two 
doubles. Yet even those statistics 
look shabby when compared to 
Fessia's contributi on. The center 
fielder went 8 for 17, had eight 
RBI's, one homerun , twO clutch 
game winning hits , made one 
spectacular game saving catch and 
pitched one seoreless inning in 
relief. "I was prerty surprised: he 
said of his performance after such 
a long layoff. 

Triton coach Lyle Yates feels that 
a layoff was the reason behind the 
team's loss on Tuesday. "I've always 
found one of the toughest games 
for us IS the first after finals week," 
he said . "We're not quite sharp. 
The pla),ers aren't quite back to 
baseball." 

But after tuning up during their 
10-4 loss to Division I University of 
Massachusetts, UCSD swept two

The first game of Friday's 
doubleheader against West CoaSt

eXCiting finish . With UCSD 
trailing 3-2 in the bottom of the 
eleventh, they loaded the bases 
with nobody out. But the next twO

runners. Next up, however, was 
Fessia, and wilh two outs, ne 
doubled to win the game. The 
second game was a 9-0 blowout. 

Saturdays games were against 
Occidental, and the results were 
identical. UCSD won the first, 4-3, 
in extra innings on a hit by Fessia, 
and the second game was won 9-0. 

Yates believes that winning the

tough games were important to the 
team. "We won a couple of one-run 
ball games," he said. 

It's obvious to our team now that 
we can win the close games. 

The Tritons are currently the 
ninth-ranked Division III in the 
nation , and number one on the

P .E. Chair Kobayashi resigns 
By GUS SANTOYO, Staff Writer 

Citing health difficulties as the 
reason , Bert Kobayashi has 
resigned as Chair of the Physical 
Education Depanment after just 
nine months at the post. 

According to Kobayashi , he has 
been diagnosed as having adult 
onset diabetes, a non-hereditary 
form of diabetes, reversable 
through proper diet and exercise. 

"I have to watch my diet and 
keep a ngorous exercise schedule 
to keep things at bay," Kobayashi 
explained. "And the kind of 
schedule I've been keeping as 
Chair doesn't allow me to pursue a 
proper exercise schedule ." 

Former chair of P.E., Howard 
Hunt, has been named the interim 
chair, effective April 1. A seareh for 
a new chair has begun within the 
depanment. 

Although Kobayashi's tenure 
was a short one, he has established 
himself as a progressive force in 
the P.E. department. Kobayashi 
was heavily involved in the 
development of the multipurpose 
spons facilities to be built just 
nOM of Third College. Kobayashi 
has also been a stoUt supportC r of 
bringing a football team to campus. 

Many withil) the depanment 
feel Kobayashi'S departure is a 
sign i fi cam loss. " It 's very 
disapPolllting," Frank Vitale said, 
director of P.E. instruction . "But 
Bert's health and recovery are what 
should be most imponant. I hope 
the direction the P.E. depanment 
had under Ben continues." 

Kobayashi said the illness 
caught him off guard. "I had never 
been sick a say in my life and I 

went in for a check-up and they 
discovered my blood sugar levels to 
be high. That's when they found 
out what I had. I was always active 
with scuba diving but when I 
became Chair, my activities 
decreased. That, combined with 
my lousy diet, brought this on." 

Kobayashi has already resumed 
scuba diving on a more regular 
basis and has set up an ollice to 
help students involved in SpOrts. 
Kobayashi will continue as an 
advisor, especially on the sport 
facility project. 

"Right now I feci great ," 
Kobayashi said . "I'm disappointed 
that I didn 't get a chance to do 
some of the things that I wanted to 
do. I hope the P.E. department 
continues to carry through some of 
the ideas and goals we 've set." ~ 

U CSD swimmers place third 
At the NCAA Division III 

swimming and diving champion-
ships in Canton, Ohio, the UCSD 
men's and women's teams each 
finished as the third best in the 
country , and UCSD 's Bill 
Kazmierowiez set a national 
record . As expected , the always 
dominant Kenyon College teams 
finished first to take both the men's 
and women's titles. For the 
women, second place went to 
Pomona-Pitzer, and Dennison 
fin ished second for the men. 

The teams that are sent by each 
school are determined by the 
performance of the swimmers 
during the regular season. Foreach 
event there is a set time that must 
be beat in order foran individual to 
be sent to the nationals. Each 
person who beats a time m a 
particular event goes on to 
represent the school, up to a limit 
of 18 men and 18 women. This 
year, UCSD sent 1 I women and 
the maximum number of lIlen. 

The women's competition was 
first gomg from March 12 through 
Mar ch 14 Enteri ng rhe 
champIOnship meet, the Tmon 

women were ranked second , but 
Coach Bill Morgan wasn ' t 
disappointed with the perform-
ance. "We had some phenomenal 
swims," he said, explaining that 
the tcam did not beat itself, but lost 
to better competition. 

The highlight of the 
championship for UCSD came in 
the men's meet, which took place 
from March 19 through March 21. 
Bill Kazmierowicz set the record in 
the 200 individual medley with a 
time of 1:50.17 He also fini shed 
second in the 200 freesryle and the 

200 backstroke. 
But the team , which was also 

ranked number twO going in, 
finished third . "We felt we could 
get second ," Morgan said . He was 
not, however, upset with the team's 
performance. 

And both the men 's and 
women's teams are very young. 
None of the 11 women who were 
sent will be graduating. And 
although the loss of Kazmierowicz 
won't help the men, he is one of 
only twO of the men qualifiers who 
will not return . IZil 

The answers to the 
last trivia quiz, along 
with a new quiz, will 
appear in Thursday'S 
paper.
