Ducheny and Davis introduced a similar bill

Ducheny said AB 1318's biparti san support

Bustamante's hill, the Higher Education 
Partnership Act of 1997, would establish a 
long-term funding model for the two university 
systems. It would guarantee the uni versi ties the 
same proportional share of the state general 
fund as they currently receive, along with 
increases to cover projected growth in enroll-
ment and the growth in per-capita personal 
income.

Committee Considers 1997-98 Student Affairs Budget Requests 
MONEY: Board 
allocates registration-
fee income 
By ErIc ... 
Staff Writer 

The 1997-98 Universi ty 
Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee, a group charged with 
allocating hundreds of thousands of 
registration-fee dollars annually, 
met yesterday to decide fu nding 
priorities for the coming year. 

Thirteen of the 20 Student 

Affairs units that receive fundIng 
from the annual $713 per student 
University Registration Fee pre-
sented the committee with 51 sepa-
rate requests. 

The units, including Campus 
Recreation, the Career Services 
Center, the International Center, 
the Student Safety and Awarenes 
Program and Student Legal 
Services, first made their 1997-98 
budget requests last fall to Joseph 
Watson, vice chancellor for student 
affairs. 

According to the Ellen 

Sherwood, the committee' execu-
tive secretary, the student represen-
tatives on the committee have spent 
the last several months reviewing 
the budget requests. 

Although the committee does 
not innuence the basic amounts 
allocated to each unit under 
Watson's budget, it does con ider 
requests for additional funding 
above the base amounts. 

The committee has $200.000 
avai lable to augment units' perma-
nent budgets, and an additional 
S 150,000 for temporary, one-year 

assistance. 
Sherwood said that the commit-

tee has appr~hed the allocation 
allowam:e for both pennanent and 
temporary requests. However, the 
committee will meet in the coming 
weeks to detennine whether to rec-
ommend any additional temporary, 
one-time funds . 

At the conclusion of yesterday's 
deliberation , the committee pro-
duced a prioritized Ii t of the unit • 
requests.

Physicist Receives Prestigious Award 
Terence Hwa, an associate professor of physics at 

UCSD, has been named a "Young Investigator" by the 
Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation. 

Hwa, who JOined the UCSD faculty in 1995, will 
rece ive $200.000 from the foundatton over two ye ars 
to support his research. Hwa appl ies mathematical 
concepts from physics to bIOlogical problems. For 
example, Hwa uses Ideas from mathematics and 
physics to explore new methods for detecting similar-
Ities between long DNA and protein sequences. 

Hwa's studies suggest a new approach that could 
speed sequence matching, potentially vital for the 
Identification of vast libraries of new genes that make

The UCSF incident prompted 
Ihe Massachusen General

Their results also appeared in Ihe 
April . 16 JAMA , entitled 
" Withholding Research Results in 
Academic Life Science ; Evidence

Faculty." 

Of 3,394 life-scicnces faculty 
members in the 50 uni versities 
recei ving the mosl funding from 
the National Inslilutes of Health 
during 1993, 19.8 percentlold the 
researchers that publicat ion of their 
work had been withheld at leasl six 
months in the last three years. 

According to the study, reasons 
for delays included "to allow for . 
palent application, to protec i a sci-
entific lead, to slow the dissemina-
lion of undesired results. to allow 
time to negotiate patents and 10

Office director Marlin 
Rachmeler served as a private 
grant investigalor before coming 10 
UCSD, earching oUI and acquir-
i ng oUlside funding sources for 
researchers. 

While Rachmeler said Ihe 
seven-year delay experienced hy 
Dong and her colleagues was 
unprecedenled. he underslood how 
such a long delay might have come 
aboul. 

Rachmeler added thai while Ihe 
situation at UCSF is un fortunate. i l 
is "an unusual case" because Ihe 
uni versilywide grant-applicalion 
proccss does nOI generally allow 
sponsoring industries to inOuence 
research results or publication . 

"The university does nOI allow 
the sponsor any power over 
rescarch publicalion," Rachmeler 
said. "The sponsor has no veto 
privilege in any IUCJ agreement." 

While corporate sponsors are 
allowed bel ween 60 and 90 days to 
review compleled research fo r 
potenti al patenl lilings. Rachmeler 
said that any six-monlh delays arc 
inappropriate and unnecessary. 

"The univer 'ity allows 90 days 
for the revicw and fi ling of a 

EWS 3 

palcnt." Rachemeler said. "There is 
no provision for the I sponsoring] 
company to approve the research. 
However, the company can review 
the research for suggestions, which 
are on mosl accounts helpful, and 
to clarify any disputes over propri-
elary malerial." 

Even Ihough less Ihan 20 per-
cent of the facullY surveyed by Ihe 
hospital researchers reported hav-
ing Iheir work held up for longer 
Ihan si x months, Alliyeh said any 
restriction on the puhlicalion of 
research is against universilY poli -
cy and its guiding research philoso-
phy. 

';UC policy promotes and pro-
tecls the free communicalion of Ihe 
rcsullS of its research," Atti yeh 
said. "No one would enter inlo an 
agreemenl thai would restri ci 
research." 

Atliyeh said Ihat Dong and her 
UCSF colleagues acccpled Knoll' s

university's normal application 
process.

Poor Voter Tumout Reftects 
Badly on Campus Spirit 

Apathy, thy name is UCSO. 
UCSO studcnts oncc again dcmonstraled Iheir com-

pldC lack of school spiril by choosing nOI to partic ipale 
in this year's A .. elecli on~ . The statisti cs provided by 
A .. Vice President Admini~trative Alex Sario were trul y 
disheartening: Le~s than 20 pen;ent of U SO 's under-
graduatcs voted in Ihe A . '. elec tion . whilc an abysmal 
487 students voted in the runofT ch.:c tion on April 16. 

The sad fact i~ that upperclassmen , who so voc ifcrou~ ­
Iy complain aboul the lack of school spirit. were the least 
likcly 10 vote in the gcneral t:lection . Freshman turned 
OLit in drove~ to vOle, and represenlcd almost one-third o f 
voters. Uppcrclassmcn , espccially seniors, werc a rare 
sighl at the election booths : Only 18 percent of those 
who voted were seniors. 

The items on Ihi s year 's ballot should have been of 
grea t interest to the sludent popUlation . The top two 
slates were polar opposites in many ways, representing 
an A.S . focus on ei ther ex ternal issues or the campus. In 
addition, students had the opportunity to have their voic-
es heard in an important, albeit non- b linding, referendum 
on whether U SD athlelics should move to Division II. 

Even morc incomprehensi ble than the low turn-out are 
student s' complaints thaI the Greeks had too much influ -
ence over Ihe election results. Undoubtedly, the majority 
of'voters were non- reeks - just observe the number of 
rrl.!silillan voters . Bul as~ullling Ihal Greeks w ere more

Of course, violent crimes aren ' t Ihe onl y things stu -

opportunistic cowards running around just waiting to 
steal your unguarded backJlack or bicycle . 

We cannot and shou ld not live in constanl fear of vio-

sonable precautions. aret is everyone's responsibility.

because you want 
to hit them up for

A Uber •• Education 
When I lirsl started UCSD in 

the fall of 1993, I feared that my 
dasses would he so polilically cor-
rect that I would not be able to get 
a good educalion. I worried Ihal my 
education would not expose me 10 
the "G real Booh" of WeSlern civi -
li zation. Thi s fear was rei nforced 
somewhat when I entered the Muir 
writing program my lirst quarter. 
The assigned reading consisted of 
,ome prelly silly and pointless arti -

The choice Is very 
simple: You can 
either sleepwalk 
your way to a B.A.

really make your 
learning experience 
something special

you will carry with 
you for the rest of 
your life.

point was to ensure "diversity" in 
our readings. 

The two-quarter Muir writing 
program is intended to teach 
im.:oming freshmen how to write 
criti cal expository essays. but all I 
remember is how much I hated the

a signed reading. I' ve learned 
more about writing from my out-
side reading, from my work at the 
Guardian and from a book called 
Style by Joseph William, . 

Even though Muir writing was 
something of a hell -hole, things 
got much better from ihere. The 
turn ing poi nt came when I decid-
ed to take a philosophy course to 
satisfy Muir 's humaniti es require-
ment. The rest is hi story. 
Ph ilosophy is now my major. and 
since my freshman year I have 
read works by Plat o, Aristotle , 
Descartes , Spinoza, Leibniz, 
LOl:ke, Berkeley. Hume, Kant , 
Augu,tine and Anselm, to name 
but a few. 

These are the great minds in 
Western thought, and I worried I 
would never get to them. I thought 
they had been all but expunged 
from academic reading lists. 

Don' t mi sunderstand me: I' m 
not saying that you have to be a 
philosophy major to get a good

education. There are plenty of 
other departments that offe r 
courses in the class ics. Reve lle's 
Humanitie equence is a good 
example. The political -sc ience 
department also offers an OU! -
standing sequence ca lled Systems 
of Poli ti ca l Thought (PS I IDA-C). 
The literature department offers 
seve ral courses in Greek and 
Roman classics. 

Make no mistake, UCSD is a 
highl y technical university. For thi s 
reason, a liberal education some-
limes gels lost in Ihe shuflle of 
chern lab reports and programs for 
CSE courses. I' m not saying that 
these other fields aren't important , 
but they' re onl y a fraction of the 
whole story. 

If you want your time at UCSD 
to payoff in the long run, take a 
wide variety of courses. Be sure to 
take courses that cover the impo r-
tant texts of Western civilization. 
Take your education seriously - it 
has to last you a lifetime.

How do you feel about the 
hype surrounding the San 
Diego music scene and its 
comparison to the Seattle 
grunge explosion? 

It died down and nobody rea lly 
cares. I gucss I liked it because our 
town was gelling recognized - the 
greal fu ckin ' music m..:cca thai it is. I 
don't know. I guess nothing eyer came 
of il becausc it's sleepy San Diego. It ·s 
too far away from L.A .• luu far soulh . 
How .. -you think the scene 
here luis changed over the last 
few y .. rs? 

It seems like there arc le~s people 
coming to shows. There was way more 
pl.!ople coming 10 the show ' during Ihe 

big hype of , an Diego Ihan Ihere is 
now. It secms like everyone is in a 
band. They' re all 100 cool to come see 
gigs now. you know? It 's like. "My 
band's playing lhat nighl" or "We' re 
rehearsing Ihat nig hl. we can ' l do 
th ar)" 
Really? I thought you would 
say that there were a lot more 
people coming to shows now.

don't think we're really an indierock

label. The people that are inlo indierock 
dun't rea ll y like us, I don 'I think. They 
just look at us and say "God, there's a fat 
guy up there wilh long hair. How do I

"Murder at 1600" looks familiar 
By NaomI Walker 
Guardian Reporter 

Watchi ng Warner Bros.' new 
suspense- thriller, "Murde r at 
1600," is like riding a ruller (;oast-
er you ' ve been on before - it's 
sti II a lot of fun, hut you have a 
good idea of what lies at (he end 
of the tunnel. 

The li lm is the ideal murder 
mystery. se rved Holl ywood·style. 
It opens with a sex scene, closes 
wi th somebody gelling caught and 
everywhere in between are perfect 
heroes and elusive vi ll ain S. The 
plot is full of sharp twists and 
dead ends, but the basic story has 
alr..:ady been played out - good 
vs. evil where (he h..:ro always 
gets his man . 

"Murder at 1600" stars Wesley 
Snipes as Harlan Regis, a Washing· 
ton, D.C. homicide detective. R..:gis 
is assigned to in vestigate a murder 
that occurs in the Whit..: House and 
soon discovers that (he government 
is run by a dill'crent code (han the 
one that rules the streets. He is 
thrust into a situati on where reputa-
tions and national securit y take 

pre(;edence over justi ce. and where 
the President and his rami Iy are to 
be protccted at all costs. 

Diane Lane plays Secret er· 
vice Agent Nina Chance, whose 
assignment is to keep Regis rrom 
discovering what really goes on in 
and around the White House. 
Regis and Chance find that neither 
their work nor their values arc 
clear-cut , as they del ve into a 
world where covering thi ngs up is 
an evcryday job. Together, they 
enter a rea lm where lell ing your 
guard down could cost you your 
life. and accusing the wrong guy 
means jeopardi zing the entirety of 
the U.S. go vernment. 

Instead of the U.S. government 
being untouchable and distanced 
fro m the events of everyday soci· 
ety, "Murder at 1600" places the 
gove rnment at the hea rt or these 
events. It is up to Regis to pene· 
trate a world of secrecy in order to 
protect all of America. 

Snipes and Lane - as well as 
the other members of this superior 
cast, incl uding Alan AIda, Denie l 
Benzali and Denn is Miller - save

Triton Playoff Hopes Rest on Berkeley Tourney 
REVENGE: Despite a recent loss to UCSB, the Tritons will have a chance to qualify for the Championships this weekend 
By Joqh HI.en.on 
Staff Writer 

Have you ever heard the phrase, 
"Somebody has got to lose"? If 
you ' ve been a sports fan for long 

enough, you ' ve prob-
ably said it on more 
than- one occasion. 
The sad thing is that 
solace can ' t be found 
in accepting that 
someone must lose. 
Losing is never fun, 
especially when 

you've already lost to the same team 
three times in one season. 

However, losing is an integral 
part of every young team 's develop-
ment. One cannot be excessively 
harsh on the UCS D women's water 
polo team, especially taking into 
consideration the fact that 10 out of 
the 18 players on the team arc fresh-
men. That means 56 percent of the 
team had never played in a college 
game before this season. So, Tri ton 

fans should consider this and the 
ways they have improved in order to 
evaluate their season. 

The UeSD women 's water polo 
team faltered once again last Friday 
in its last regular-season game of the 
year, sufferi ng a 5-3 loss to the ue 
Sant Barbara Gauchos. The women 
from Santa Barbara have had the 
Tritons' number all season. UCSB 
handed the Tritons a tough loss, 
finishing with a four-game season 
sweep of the Tritons, and dropping 
their record to 2· 13. 

"We can beat Santa Barbara, 
but we keep blowing it," red-shirt 
Jenny Ness said. "We had a really 
good time over the weekend, but 
we didn ' t pl ay very well against 
UeS B." 

Despite high spirits before the 
game, a quick goal scored by the 
Gauchos in the first period ueked 
the wi nd out of UCSD's sail. Af· 
ter that goal,the Tritons trailed for 
the remainder of the game, despite 

exce llent play in the fourth quarter 
that kept UCS B scoreless for the 
period. 

UCSD 's downfall continues to 
be its lack of offensive prowess. 
Errant shots, missed 4-meter pen-
alt y shots and a poor conversion 
percentage on six-on-five 's all con-
tributed to the Tri tons ' offensive 
troubles. Allowing only five goals 
shows defensive abi li ty, but if the 
scoring pum;h is absen t. wins can-
not be expected . 

Sophomore Jenny Irwin scored 
two goals in the contest, while 
freshman Anne Can non added one 
of her own . Triton goalie Maryam 
H adiashar 

not a sweet feeling to suffer another 
defeat to UeSB, the Tritons still 
have a shot at qualifyi ng for Nation-
als this weekend. On Thursday they 
will leave for Berkeley to partici-
pate in the Western Qualification 
Tournament. Oftheeighttcams that 
will be therc, seven will go on to 
Nationals. Despite thei r record, the 
Tritons know they have a good 
chance at qualifying for the 
postseason. They are hoping for 
another matchup with Santa Bar-
bara, in a game that will surely prove 
to be a grudge match for the Tritons. 

Afterthegame last Friday, UCSD 
played in the UC Santa Barbara "B"

Sav •• : HUSlez (UCSO) 6 give the players who 

season. 

Although it i 

normally don ' t get much playing 
time, so me va luable minutes to 
showcase what they can do. 

''The tournament was fun and I 
ac tually got to score one," sopho-
more field player YivianJansen said. 

Jansen is one of the pl ayers who 
sees lim ited action in mos t games, 
but in the tournament she was given 
the opportunity to take a 4-meter 
penalty shot, and ca lmly blew the 
ball past the UCS B goalie. 

Of the fou r games UCSD played 
in the "B" tournament , the Tri tons 
won three. Their only defeat came 
agai nst an experienced Commerce 
team. 

All things considered, it was a 
fun-tilled weekend for UCSD, but 
amid the team camaraderi e, the Tri-
ton women know what is riding on 
their play thi s weekend at the West-
ern Qualification Tournament. If 
they can improve their shooting per-
centage , they wi ll have a great shot 
at going on to Nationals.

Continued from page 16 
progressed. By the fourth inning, 
Rondestvedt had a one-hitter, and the 
Tritons were up, 2-0. 

"TIIC minulc that first inning was 
over." Fletcher 5.1id. "1 think thatlthe 
playersl be li eved for sure that they 
could win the game." 

Thc Aztec s finally go t to 
Ronde tvedt in the bottom of the 
fifth, cu tting the lead in half. to 2-1. 
By this time the Aztecs wcre over 
the initial shock of UeSD's early 
rally, and they looked ready to make 
a run at the lead. 

In the top of the sixth. however. it 
was the Tritons who madc the big 
move, loadi ng the bases. George 
Escanuclas was batting. and the Al-
tecs had a hard-throwing pitcher in 
the game, so thcy werc shading 
Escanuelas to go the opposile way. 
But ESf.:anuclas got a pitch he liked 
and pulled it down the left-tield line. 
By the time the Aztec left fi elder got 
to the ball, Escanuelas was on third, 
and the Tritons wcre on their way to 
an eight-run rally that would put the 
game away. 

With the game in hand , 
Rondestvedt continued to mow 
down the Aztecs down. In the bot-
tom of the ninth, he wa~ approach-
ing 150 pitches throw n, but 
Rondestvedt wanted to have his 
compl ete game. 

"The pitching coach. Pat Hause. 
came oUllo the mound and ~a id . 'Good 
game.'" Rondestvedt said. "And I said. 
, You ' re not even taking me uut ur this 
gamc.' So he asked me ir I wanted to 
fini sh it and I said. 'You're damn right 
I want to fini sh it. .. ·

Softball Skid Continues Against Toreros 
uhs broad<:aster - namely, 

Harry Caray. 
SLIDE: Having 10 t ix of its last seven, UCSD returns home after dropping USD doubleheader 

Think about the possibilities 
of throwing that beloved fossil 
into the mix . Yes, I'm talking 
about llial Harry Caray - the 
one whose lisp makes Sly 
Stallone's speech sound 
articulate, the one who wears 
lenses that seem to get thicker 
by the day. He may be older 
than fire and farther gone than 
Ronald Reagan, but nobody 
else epitomizes Cubs' baseball 
like Caray. Anybody who has 
listened to him call a game 
knows how he can make the 
routine seem surreal , com-
monly miscalling plays and 
horribly mispronouncing 
names. 

Chicago love him. After

Senior Slaff Writer 

Toward the cnd of a meal , you 
generally get full and start to slow 
your eating pace. Toward the end or 

a long night of study-
ing, your brain gets 
tired and things gri nd 
to a halt . However, 
over the cour e of a 
softball season, keep-
ing energy and mo-
mentum is of the ut-
most importance; the 

team that learns to endure a tough 
season will gracefully succeed. 

The women of UCSD's softball 
team appear to ~ave hit the wall. 
Having lost six of their last seven 
contests, the majority of them on the 
road, the weary squad stayed close 

to home to hattle<:rosstown foc SO. 
Though not overmatchcd hy thcir 
Division I rivals, the women nonc-
theless succumbed in ooth games of 
a douhleheader. 

In the opencr, the women played 
an ex<:ellent game for fiv~ innings. 

1rurler Erin Flanigan allowed only 
two runs over that span, and went 
into the ixth inning with a 3-2 lead. 

Unfortunately, things didn ' t go 
well for the Tritons after the fi flh 
inning. The Toreros pounded out hit 
after hit, and when the dust settled, 
the Tritons had been pummeled, 11 -
3. Searching for an explanation, 
catcher Sara Snyder said, "II was a 
combination of defense that wasn ' t 
what it has been and their good 
hitting." 

The second leg of the double-

hcadcr wa a mirror image almost 
exactly the opposi tc. The Toreros 
maintaincd the hot hilling, scoring 
four runs in thc first and two more in 
the second inning. However, senior 
Kri stin Schueler came in and put out 
the fire, allowing only two runs in 
four innings of relief to back up her 
superlative hitting. 

Meanwhi Ie, the UCSD bats si m-
mered, scoring three runs until heat-
ing up with a rally in the seventh. 
However,the ladies could only notch 
two more run and suffered an 8-5 
loss. Unlike the first clash, the 
women finished strongly , but the 
bitter taste of defeat remained. 

"They put it together in the last 
inning, but before that they were 
going through the motions and you 
can't do that. Before the last in-

Head Coac h Patricia Gercken s 
said. 

"I think inexperience has some-
thing to do with it. They put a lot of 
pressure on themselves. We have 
incredible hitters; our first six bat-
ters are excellent and they ' re hit-
ting, but they ' re just not hilling with 
people on ba e." 

"II 's tough late in the season to 
keep the energy up," Snyder said. "I 
think people know we have to suck 
it up. (The losses) weren ' t all nega-
tive - I think people know we can 
beat these teams." 

Though the postseason is not an 
impossible dream at this point, it is 
doubtful the women will receive a 
tournament bid. The young ladies,
