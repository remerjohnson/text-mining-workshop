Staf' Writer 

Charges have yet to be filed against 13 
UCSD students 'and two janitors who were 
arrested Friday during a protest supponing the 
unionization of janitors on campus. 

The 15 were taken into custody by San 
Diego police for unlawrul assembly, failure to 
disperse after being ordered to do so, and 
impeding the flow of traffic. 

All charges are misdemeanors. 

Mit's too soon: said Ann Marie Council 
from the San Dieso City Attorney's Office on 
Wednesday, refemng to the process of filing 
charges. Charges could be filed in the near 
future. 

The arrests occurred after members of 
Students for Economic Justice and Service

marched off campus and blocked the intersec-
tion of La Jolla Village Drive and Villa La Jolla

viction of possession , two ye<l rs fo r the sec-
ond, and indefinitely after three or more 
convictions, according to MCC t'x-offiCio 
member James Meeker, 

The resolution, already passed by student 
governments at UC Berkeley and Yak. calls 
upon Congress to repeal the :tmendment that. 
according to the resolution, "denies or delays 
access to financial aid based upon convictions 
for drug-related offenses." 

It was presented as new business at last 
Wednesday's A.S. Council meeting, and was 
voted on last night at the council's final 
meeting of the year. 

"It's good to see that A.S. is following the 
lead of Muir COllege Council on this issue: 
said MCC Ambassador of Communication 
and the Arts Michael Zank . 

Concerns with the amendment have 
arisen lately, despite its passing in 1998, 
because of the change in presidencies. The 
Clinton administration was not tough on 
enforcement, but the Bush administration 
has been cracking down, Meeker said. 

The argument against the current law 
alleges that the provision is discriminatory 
toward the poor and minorities.

Graduate Student Fee Referendum Fails 
Defeat blamed on problems with personal access codes and lack of publicity 
By MATT SCHRADER 

. Associate News Editor 

The Graduate Student 
Association's fee referendum 
failed when voting closed June 4, 
because it did not receive the 
required 20 percent vote participa-
tion. 

The lack of publicity and prob-
lems with academic departments 
over personal access code num-
bers are the alleged causes of the 
referendum's failure. The referen-
dum would have added $5 to grad-
uate student fees to help fund 

GSA activities. 
GSA Vice President of Finance 

Frank Chang said the ramifica-
tions of the failure cou ld be disas-
trous. 

"If we don't do this, a lot of 
programming will be cut," he said, 
"There will be cuts across the 
board and we don't want that." 

Chang said that one of the 
main reasons the referendum 
failed is that the GSA had little 
time to publicize it. 

"It was a really ' rushed thin~: 
Chang said. "We couldn't adverttse 
this until after the student life ref-

erendum was over." 
The voting for the referendum 

ran from May 22 to June 4. 
Computer problems were also 

cited by Chang as a cause of the 
referendum's failure. Chang said 
that many graduate departments 
make their students change their 
PAC number every quarter and, as 
a result, each student must talk to 
his advisor to get a new number. 
Many of the 3,500 graduate stu-
dents did not obtain new num-
bers, and therefore could not vote 
on the referendum. 

"Unforturately, we experienced 

some problems with PAC num-
bers and StudentLink that we 
were not aware of when we decid-
ed to run an electronic ballot," sa id 
outgoing GSA Vice President of 
Finance Jenn Whi les, 
"Consequently, we were unable to 
achieve the 20 percent voter 
turnout required to make the vote 
valid ," 

However, many graduate stu-
dents said they did not vote 
because they were uninformed . 
There were few posters around

Resolution: 
Drug offenders currently 
lose federal financial aid 
ContInued from page A1 
against the resolution in MCC, dis-
agrees. 

"To a cenain extent, I feel it 's nOt 
discriminatory, because it's not based 
on someth ing people can't help," 
Barge said. 

Also, the current law is difficult to 
~nforce, according to Meeker and A.S. 
Senator Nick Lieberknecht. 

"Another nuance to this is that 
there is no institutional mechanism to 
check for [drug offensesl ," 
Lieberknecht said. "There's no institu-
tional mechanism in the [Free 
Application for Federal Student Aidl 
to check if you have been caught." 

The issue is one of mora16 for 
many of the members of the councils. 

"The federal government should be 
in the business of making it easier for 
people to get an education: Meeker 
said . "If you get caught smoking mari -
juana, they take away your life." 

Barge said that students could eas-
ily avoid losing financial aid eligibility, 
if they wanted . 

"I feel as though students who 
receive financial aid can take steps to 
ensure that their financial aid is pre-
served in the future: Barge said. 

MCC held an open forum for stu-
de nts to discuss the issue last 
Thursday at its meeting. 

The 1998 amendment, which met 
little opposition at the time, is now 
under fire by Massachusetts Rep. 
Barney Frank. Frank proposed an 
amendment to it in February. The 
amendment was co-sponsored by 29 
other representatives. 

Many students doubt the effective-
ness of the resolution and the pro-
posed amendment. 

"I doubt that the provision will be 
repealed from the law," Barge said . 
" 0 lawmaker wants to appear as 
though he or she is soft on drugs." 

Failure: 
GSA predicted to be 
$8,000 in debt by 2003

campus and very litt le information on 
them. according to Chang. 

"I gOt a notice from the GSA say-
ing when the vote was and to vote 
'yes,'" said graduate student of eco-
nomics Jocelyne Arnoll. "Bu t there 
was lillie information on what this was 
aboul." 

Chang said the referendum was not 
administered before the Student Life 

F~l' Rdcrendum because Vice 
Chancellor joe Watson would not sign 
it if It passed. 

According to Chang, if the gradu-
ate student kc referendum had passed 
before the student life referendum 
earlier this quarter, the graduate stu-
dents lI1ight not have voted, knowing 
they already had increased funding on 
their own. 

Chang said that Watson, fearing 
that the Student Life foee Referendum 
would not receive eno ugh student 
votes to pass, said he would not allow 
the graduate referendum to take place 
earlier. 

Watson was not available to com-
ment on these claims. 

As a result of the referendum not 
passing, many programs that the GSA 
normally funds, including many 
undergraduate programs like the Djs 
and Vinylphiles club. will have to be 
cut. 

In 1994, the GSA passed a simi lar 
referendum, which resulted in a large 
budget surplus. However, every year 
since, the amount of money spent on 
funding organizations, paying a busi-
ness manager and other expenses has 
gone $12,000 over budget. 

After next year, the surplus creat-
ed by the 1994 referendum will be 
down to $4,000 and the extra $1 2,000 
needed to maintain the GSA budget 
will cause a deficit of $8,000.

Loan Relief on the Way FI.ND· 
Rep. Miller proposes to drop origination fee on loans 'i-'~OOI\'I_fI$ 

····,;t~'" W~tC'h t(")f th~ 
~umm~r I~~ue ... 

By ANNIE NGUYEN 
Contributing Staff Writer 

In an attempt to eliminate the origination 
fee from all student loans, congressman 
George Miller, D-Calif., proposed in April 
the Affordable Student Loans Act of 2001 . 

The origination fee is a 3 percent to 4 
percent deduction from the total that stu-
dents receive from loans. Students are 
expected to repay the full amount they bor-
row even though they only receive between 
96 and 97 percent of the initial loan. 

For example, a student wi th a $1 ,000 loan 
and a 4 percent origination fee will receive an 
actual amount of $960, but he or she is 
required to pay back the full $1,000 plus 
interest. 

The average student debt after four years 
is $12,000. The Affordable Student Loans 
Act will save students about $400 on their 
loans and may make the Direct Student 
Loan, as well as other guaranteed loan pro-

GSA: 
Graduate student budget currently 
funds Wuiergraduate activities 
Continued from .,.,. A2 

However, many graduate students have 
begun to doubt the need for the extra spend-
ing on undergraduate activities. 

"There is no specific reason to support 
that: said economics graduate student 
Bolong Cao. "Even if there is, who can guar-
antee that expenditure will benefit us?" 

Others feel that the ponion of the 
$12,000 that goes to graduate student pro-
gramming is wasted money because the pop-
ularity of these activities is very minimal. 

Rates: 
The Fed plans to cut interest 
rates on student loans 
ContI ... ed from page A1 

Servites. "The interest rate has been near the 
8.25 percent cap for the past several years," 
she said. 

According to the National Council of 
Higher Education Loan Programs, student 
loans are the largest source of student aid, 
and by law, the federal student loan interest 
rate cannot exceed 8.25 percent. 

Fairchilds said the rate change will espe-

grams, more affordable for students. .. 
"Although this isn 't a lot of money, tt IS a 

step by the federal government in ~he r!~ht 
direction to recognizt: that the umverSltles 
are not affordable," sa id A.S. Vice President 
Internal jenn Brown. "It's their responsibility 
to make colleges and universities more 
accessible to students." 

UCSD Director of Financial Aid Offices 
Vince DeAnda said the bill would benefit stu-
dents, but will cost the government in the long 
run because it will be another budget item. 

"It 's a good thing for students," DeAnda 
said. "However, it's going to be an expense 
for the federal government and cOSt the gov-
ernment billions." 

Congress enacted the origination fee in 
1981 to reduce the deficit , raise revenue for 
the government and reduce the cost of student 
loans. It is often called the "student loan taX ." 

However, the fee docs not pay for any 
administrative costs or program costs for 
students. 

Some say the money spent on such activities 
as Spring Fling and Blue Mondays at the Pub 
should be decreased because most graduate 
students are too busy to take pan in them. 

"No one I know goes to GSA events any-
way, so the GSA probably has too much of 
our money already," Arnott said. "Why not 
spend it on activities for [undergraduatesl 
who can actually participate in them?" 

Currently, the GSA is planning a new 
referendum to be voted on in the fall. 

"We are going back to the drawing board 
and trying to make it so that we can have 
another computer election in the fall ," said 
Lynn Peterson, director of Graduate 
Students Student Activities. "Hopefully we 
can have all the graduate students vote this 
time." 

cia lly affect students who have unsubsidized 
loans, or loans in which the borrower is 
responsible for paying the interest while in 
college. 

With subsidized loans, the federal govern-
ment pays the interest while the student is in 
college and up to six months after graduation. 

"If you have a subsidized loan, this really 
won't affect you until you begin the repay-
ment process," Fai rchilds said. "But for those 
who are currently paying interest, it wi ll save 
you money." 

The U.S. Department of Education must 
approve the rate cut.

The UCSD Guardian OPINION A9 

Religion and Science Do Not Mix 
Darwi n's evolution theory beats faith-based notions 
Editor: 

There is a god. If Sir Isaac 
eWlOn said so, then it must be 

true. 
In an article published in the 

Guardian (Monday. June 4. 2001), 
Theodore Dokko claimed that the 
universe was indeed created by 
God in six literal days. and that 
physicists and biologists ' indoctri-
nate us to believe otherwise from 
earJy childhood. 

If only we opened our eyes. he 
claims. we would see evidence all 
around us for an intelligent 
designer - for God. The Big Bang 
Theory for the creation of the 
universe and Charles Darwin's 
theory of evolution by means of 
natural selection - so Dokko 
claims - are full of gaping holes 
that can only be filled by the 
insertion of a supreme being. This 
reasoning represents a gross mis-
understanding of what science is 
and what the scientific method 
can and cannot explain . 

Science is based on the premise 
that the natural world can be 
explained materialistically in terms 
of testable physical processes. Gaps 
in understanding are not demon-
strations of theistic processes. 
Rather they are the questions upon 
which science thrives. 

On the other hand. religion is 
bas'ed on the premise that we can 
only understand the world and 
our place within it if we acknowl-
edge the existence of a divinity (or 
divinities) . In this world view. not 
everything is open to materialistic 
explanation . 

The scientific method cannot 
be used to disprove or prove the 
existence of God (or gods) 
because the physical cannot be 
used to test something that is not

physical. Although individual 
researchers may have their own 
personal spiritual beliefs, science 
itself has nothing to say on the 
mailer of God. 

Intelligent design theory. on 
the other hand, purports to use 
scientific reasoning to prove th.at 
God must exist. The theory claims 
that the world is so immensely 
complex that "mere randomness 
and chance" cannot explain it. 

The beauty and intricacy the 
natural world. and of the universe 
in which it resides. invokes won -
der in all of us. but this does not 
prove or disprove the existence of 
a deity or deities. 

Yes, only a minority of stars 
give the right conditions for life as 
we know it. But the universe is big 
- very big. There is a mind-bog-
glingly large number of stars out 
there, and if only a fraction of a 
fraction of them arc similar to our 
sun, it still leaves a vas t number of 
contenders for life on planets sim-
ilar to Earth . 

Perhaps the better question is 
not why is our sun so perfect. but 
why isn't life evolving all over the 
place? Who knows? Maybe it is. 

And the human eye is indeed 
an awesome piece of engineering 
- something that is well beyond 
our current technology to repli -
cate - but does this automatical-
ly prove the existence of God? 

Dokko would claim that the 
chance of creating an eye by the 
random accumulation of its con-
stituent parts is so incredibly small 
that the only possible explanation is 
the existence of an intelligent 
designer. But the theory of evolu-
tion by means of natural selection 
is far more sophistica ted than the 
chance coincidence of particles. 

The key behind the evolut ion-
ary process is descent with modi -
fi cation. In its simplest terms. it is 
beneficial modifications. which 
originally arise through a random 
process that goes on to be repre-
sented in future generations. 
Future modifications build upon 
aeons of previous beneficial mod-
ifications. 

A few photosensitive cells are 
modified and modified and modi-
fied through the process of natur-
al selection until a structure as 
impressive as the human eye is 
formed . Its intricacy does not

Expanding Horizons in Different Worlds Theory: Intelligent design 
postulate is flawed College exper~ences are not the only path to personal development and maturity 
Continued fronI PICe A. 

By CLAIRE VANNmE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Last weekend. there was a mes-
sage on my answering machine. It 
was my friend Sonny. tell ing me 
tha t he had arrived in San Diego 
after a nine-month absence. I was 
used to such messages from my 
high school pals who were trick-
ling in from Berkeley and the state 
schools. because they fi nished 
their finals and conseq uently their 
first year of college long before we 
quarter system students. 

However. Sonny didn't spend 
this year in college. Although he 
graduated. like me. with honors in 
June 2000. he chose to take'a year 
off fro m school and go instead to 
Oregon. to be a forest ranger. He 
was the only one of my high 
school friends who didn't go to a 
university or a community college. 

I called him. I th ink I was actual-
ly nervous. or anxious. or excited in 
some other way that I couldn't real-
ly place. Sonny and I hadn't been 
especially close in high school -
we were on the staff of the newspa-
per together. hung with the same 
crowd and had some classes and 
interesting conversations together 
- but we had exchanged infre-
quent letters while he was gone. 

In the fall. I told him about 
classes. about the dorms. about all 
the new situa tions I was finding 
myself in . He wrote back. saying 
this of his routine: "I chop wood. I 
burn wood. I cook food . I eat food . 
I play in the snow (I think they ca ll 
it work here). I read books. I write 
leners to all my good-for-nothing 
friends. I laugh at all of my good-
for· nothing friends who are going 
to college." 

The last sentence he amended: 

"I am still looking forward to col-
lege and even envy you, despite 
the con tent I feel." 

I couldn 't imagine why he'd 
want to trade places with me, 
when what I wanted right then 
was to drop out and dash up to 
Oregon immediately. switching 
sneakers for skis and studying for 
hiking through the woods. 

He sounded different when we 
spoke on the phone - quieter 
than I had remembered. This was. 
after all. the guy who had cracked 
up our journalism class by loosing 
a blue streak of expletives without 
provocation at my best friend. and 
chucking a computer disk directly 
into the forehead of a staff writer 
(a lbeit accidentally). He also ran 
nude into the Pacific Ocean at a 
bonfire. but that's another stoty. 

"The year has been ... different: 
he said haltingly. "I haven't mea-
sured it the way you have. with 
midterms and finals and things." 

I thought I had measured the 
year more in vacations - how 
long until they came. how many 
hours of relaxation and freedom I 
could squeeze in between work 
and family obligations: and how 
long I'd have unti l the next release. 

When we got together on 
Monday night. we met where a 
road dead-ends into a canyon. He 
had a backpack burdened with 
supplies: He was going to spend 
the night in his sleeping bag in the 
chapparal. and then hike six miles 
to the beach in the morning. 
"Having trouble readjusti ng to 
civilization?" I joked. He stared 
out into the canyon. mute. 

"I'm different: he said when I 
asked how he was doing in gener-
al. "I've changed. I th ink I've 
become more left-wing." By way of 

explanation. he indicated the 
houses on the bluff above us. with 
their marked-off backyards. "We 
have all these invisible but very 
real boundaries. I mean ... all it is is 
a piece of paper in City Hall: 

But as he told me about his 
experiences, I realized that his 
changes were deeper than politi-
ca l. 

He independently tackled all 
manner of job situations. includ-
ing carrying a man who died from 
a heart attack on a ski slope and 
having to assist in identifying him. 
He climbed mountains with a pick 
axe and crampons despite a fear of 
heights. 

"You just have to do it: he said 
of clinging to a sheer r.ock face at 
thousands of feet of elevation. 
· Once you've started. you've got 
inertia on your side: You've just 
taken one step. so why can't you 
take one more?" 

I studied him during a pause in 
our conversation. He looked differ-
ent. His hair was long and 
unkempt. and he sported a tuft of 
a goatee. His face was gaunt. And 
the way he looked at things. his 
eyes fli tting from surface to sur-

. face~ then lighting on some distant 
point. seemed so unlike the other 
people I interacted with on a daily 
basis. the college kids and even my 
parents. I ca lled him a "wild man 
of the woods." It was the "man" 
part that was the truest. 

And when he as.ked me about 
my year. what could I say? I ra ttled 
on about professors and room-
mates and car trouble. It sounded 
hollow. I tried to elaborate on what 
I was saying. embroidering it to 
make it seem as exci ting as his sto-
ries. but I still felt that somehow I 
wasn't measuring up. I knew it 

wasn 't because of Sonny - he 
questioned me doggedly about 
dorm life and classes and updates 
on all our friends. 

Finally. I admitted it. to him and 
to myself: "I 've been feeling a lot of 
wanderlust this year: I told him 
that I was chafing under the rigid-
ness of my routine, and that what I 
wanted more than anything was to 
pack up and disappear for a while. 
on my gwn. with nothing to dictate 
the path I would take except my 
own whim and naked opportunity. I 
don't think it was the most com-
forting thing to tell him. as this fall 
he heads east to Dartmouth and 
has hinted at his apprehension. 

But he understood. of course. 
He encouraged me to fo llow my 
plan of road-tripping alone in 
September, between my summer 
job and the beginning of school. 
And I said I thought success in 
college - meaning enjoyment and 
fulfillment - was a mixture of 
dumb luck and effort . 

"You have to get off your ass 
and get involved: I said. "Look at 
me: During fall quarter. I sat in my 
dorm and was really. really lonely 
and depressed. Then I started get-
ting out. meeting people ... and 
things are better." 

I didn't tell him that while 
th ings are better - downright 
good. in fact - I still feel unful-
filled. unsuccessful. I still feel like 
the same girl I was in high school . 
when we graduated together. And 
I can't help wondering how things 
would be different if I'd taken his 
path. how I would be different. 
Sonny postponed college and 
became a man. I have a 3.95 GPA 
at a nationally recognized univer-
si ty. and I wonder .when I will 
become a woman. 

deny a materialistic explanation. 
With further aeons of evolution 

who knows what feats of engineer-
ing will be accomplished. 

As far as theories go. Charles 
Darwin's theory of evolution by the 
means of natural selection has stood 
the test of time remarkably well . 

It is a theory that is questioned 
every day in numerous laborato-

, ries and out in the field every sin-
gle day. and it is yet to be refuted . 
We see evolution happening all 
around us. 

In a matter of a few years. we 
have witnessed the evolution of 
bacteria that are immune to antibi-
otics. and it is the evolvability of 
HIV that makes it such a formida-
ble health care crisis. 

Evolutionary theory is the only 
viable testable theory out there 
explaining the complexity of life .. 
Intelligent design theory cannot be 
tested empirically and therefore 
cannot be considered -a viable sci-
entific theory. The physical cannot 
explain the supernatural. 

Humans. by nature, have a 
desire to understand the world in 
which we reside. When physical 
explanations are not forthcoming. 
we each have a choice. We can 
either look to the spiritual or con-
tinue to seek a materialistic under-
standing. 

Scientists can only evaluate the 
evidence available to them. Evolu-
tionary biology is not in the business 
of denying the existence of God. 

It is a science. like other sci-
ences. that aims to understand the 
majesty of the natural world. Intel-
ligent design theory cannot prove 
the existence of God. It is based on 
faith. not on science.

"The prescribed .punishment

includes death if all of the 12 
Jurors believe It is justified under

Other leading contributors to

Washington . whose president, 
jonathan Lash, was instrumental 
in developing the project; the 
Global Environment Facility, a 
body set up after the 1992 Rio de

the World Bank. 

The project is expected to 
cost $21 million, of which about 
$17 million has been pledged. 
Up to 1,500 scientists are being 
asked to volunteer their expertise

involvement of other potential 
suspects, saying "it will not change

Whether the death sentence

remained uncertain . After the rul-

McVeigh's lawyers said 
that they would appeal

The project, designed and

will also benefit from the use of

case had been discovered in FBI 
offices. 

"It 's a good thing I was in quiet 
chambers because my judicial 
temperament escaped me," he 
sa id. "It was shocking." 

The FBI documents included 
inrerview reports that investiga-
tors had prepared during the case. 
but had fai led to turn over to 
defense lawyers as reqllired. 

McVeigh had originally been 
scheduled fo r execution on May 
16, bu t after th e justice 
Department publ icly disclosed 
th e existence of the documents 
on May 11 , Ashcroft ordered a 
one- month delay to allow 
lawyers time to review the docu-
me nts. 

The documents at issue in the 
hearing have never been made 
public because Matsch ordered 
them sealed.

Arrests: 
SE] negotiated with 
SDPD ahead of time 
ContInued from PICe A1 
Drive. 

"It went fairly smooth," said San 
Diego Police Sergeant Art Bowen. 
"They stayed in the intersection 
and legally, I had to tell them that 
they must leave the 
intersection. The first group left. 
The second group remained. They 
were the ones arrested." 

After the police ordered the 
intersection cleared and the 15 

price of bail. 
Once this figure was agreed on, 

SEIU and SEj determined how 
many could be arrested and bailed 
out by the union without leaving 
anyone behind. 

Civil disobedience tactics were 
used to draw attention to the jani-
tors' cause, said Eugene 
Mahmoud, an SEj member who 
was one of the 15 arrested. 

"It was important because we 
were trying to have a voice on a sit-
uation of economic justice," 
Mahmoud said. "A different voice 
was achieved by taking it off cam-
pus: 

Friday was the first time protest-
refused to leave, 
they were immedi-
ately taken into 
custody and trans-
ported to jail. 

Men were taken 
to the county jail 
downtown and 
women were taken 
to Las Colinas 
Women's Detention 
Facility in Santee. 

According to 
Bowen and Mike 
Wilzoch, deputy 
director of SEIU 
Local 2028, protest-

"They stayed in the 
intersection and 
legaily, I had to tell 
them that they must 
leave the intersection. 
The first group left. 
The secorui 
remained. They were 
the ones arrested. " 

ers were arrested in 
the strins of 
protest actiVities by 
SEj and SEIU. 

The . SEj and 
SEIU are demand-
ing a "living wage-
of $11.24, health 
benefits, the 
opportunity to 
organize and the 
reinstatement of 
one fired janitor. 

Wilzoch pro-
vided the Guardian 
with a list of the 

- Art Bowen students and jani-
ers were aware of San Diego Police Sergeant tors arrested. 
the consequences of 
blocking the intersection. 

Both cooperated in making sure 
the protests and arrests occurred 
peacefully. 

"They were very cooperative, 
they were very civil," Bowen said. 
"We thanked them for that; they 
didn 't have to be." 

The arrested protesters were 
released early the next morning 
after posting bail of around $550 
each. According to Wilzoch, bail 
was provided by the SEIU. 

Wilzoch and one arrested Stu-
dent confirmed that, prior to the 
protest. a deal was worked out 
between SEIU lawyers and law 
enforcement on charges and the 

Efforts to con-
firm th is with the city attorney's 
office and sheriff's department 
have been unsuccessful. 

According to Wilzoch's list, 
studen ts Viviana Avita, Brian 
Babb, joy de la Cruz, Rene Gube, 
Scott jordan Kerns, Stephen Klass, 
Yesiga Lopez, Eleazar Loza, 
Eugene Mahmoud, Lucia Moriz, 
Melissa Schweisguth, justin 
Searchy and josh Wilson were 
arrested. 

SEIU Local 2028 janitors 
Ignacio Quinones and Albino 
Goazzles were also arrested for 
their parts in what both the SEJ 
and SDPD are calling civil disobe-
dience.

UC Davis Undergrad Drowns 
Accidental death was the second this week 

DAVIS, Calif. - Just three days after UC 
Davis student Cerina Vollmer was killed in a 
car accident. another Davis student - 20-
year-old Colin Patrick Vetter - drowned 
while swimming in the Yuba River in levada 
County, Calif. 

At about noon. Vetter and three friends 
went to the south fork of the river to eat 
lunch and swim. They were appa re ntl~ 
caught in an undercurrent in an area known 
as Emerald Pool. 

Vetter's friends were abk to escape the cold 
waters. but he was pulled under and neva 
resurfaced, according to Nevada County Chief 
Deputy Coroner Cathy Valceschini. 

One friend reportedly dived in to help 
Vetter and "spotted his shoultkrs" at one 
point , but was unable to reach him, 

Valceschini said. After becoming fatigued and 
scared for his own safety, the friend got out of 
the water and drove with Vetter's other 
friends to get help. 

Vetter's body was recovered at 9:20 p.m. 
by the Truckee Fi re Department and 
Recovery Team. An autopsy conducted Friday 
morn ing showed that Vetter drowned. 

A toxicology screening was conducted, 
but results are not yet al'a ilable. It docs not 
appear that drugs or alcohol were factors in 
Vetter's drowning, Valccschini said. 

Vetter began attendi ng UC DaVIS 111 
September 2000 and was a social sciences 
major.

Club: 
The UCSD clubs had 
an interesting year 
ContInued fronI ...,. All 

beat nationally ranked UC Santa 
Barbara in consecutive r~attas. 
The lHtons placed eighth In the 
Pacific Coast Sailing Champi-
onships at the end of the year, 
sailing against the best teams on 
the West Coast. 

The UCSD skilsnowboard 
team took an. eight-hour van 
ride to Mammoth Mountain 
every other weekend. It was the 
top combined ski and snow-
board team in the league. The 
individual snow board team 
took second while the individ-
ual ski team placed first in the 
league overall. 

The surf team, led by nation-
ally ranked surfer Holly Beck, is 
still in the middle of its season. 
This month it will travel to Dana 
Point, Calif., to compete in the 
National Scholastic Surfing 
As1iol;iation Surfing Champi-

- onsbips. 
The men's ultimate disc team 

earned a third-place title at the 
regional competition and was 
the only team in the league able 
to beat the Santa Barbara Black 
Tide this year.

The women's ultimate disc 
team is still throwing the Frisbee 
after breezing through sectionals 
and regionals. It is preparing for 
nationals in Boston . 

. The UCS D water ski team's 
season was overshadowed by 
the death of teammate Dustin 
Newell on his way to an Ari-
zona competition earlier this 
year. Despite this tragedy, the 
team pulled together to have a 
good season. Nikki Kennedy set 
a school record with a jump of

81 feet, shattering the old 
record of 73 feet , and Brian 
Kennedy was named Most 
Impressive Forward, while 
Counney Geigle was voted 
Most Impressive Back. 

All in all , this year was 
extremely tumultuous for 
UCSD club sports teams as 
some rose, some fell, some 
struggled, some dominated, 
some ended the year early, and 
some fortunate ones are still 
competing. 

All are doing exciting things 
and are definitely worth check-
ing out next ye'dr.

"Greg has been a great leader 
among all of the breast strokers, 
being the only senior breast stro-
ker, and is just an all around good 
guy," McGihon said. 

Wong is another swimmer 
who will be tough to replace. He 
holds a school record in the 400 
1M and was extremely versatile. 
McGihon recalls, "Wong was def-
initely the most versatile swim-
mer out of all of the seniors. He 
could swim in all of the events 
and could score in every one of 

our coverage. 
It isn't perfect. ( wish ( could 

work 50 hours per week here. ( 
wish we were a daily paper. ( wish it 
paid $60,000 per year. 

Though it is never about the 
money with the Guardian, it would 
help the bills. I wish I had a staff of 
20 and an unlimited budget so I 
could travel with the teams. 

I wish. 
Everyone here is a student. 

There is no journalism program at 
UCSD. Most of us had experience 
at other papers before coming here, 
in high school or elsewhere, but 
few of us have had a formal educa-
tion in journalism. This is where 
we learn. This is where we make 
our mistakes. 

This is where we prepare for the 
real world. This is the minor 
leagues. 

This also is not our entire life. I 
wish it could have been a bigger 
part of my life. I love the Guardian 
and loved being sports editor. But 
many people here are taking 16 or 
20 units every quarter. Education 

them. He had a great amount of 
talent, especially in the mid~le 
distance and IMs." 

The women are also going to be 
without four of their athletes next 
season. 

Chief among them will be 
Sharon Smith, wljo holds several . 
school records. She also scored 
individually at nationals. Smith was 
also the team's captain, and 
according to McGihon, "one of the 
more dependable freestylers on the 
team." 

Christina Guintu impressed 
McGihon with her dedication. 

"She was always the first person 
in the pool for practice and really 
cares about the program a lot. She 
was a very hard worker, and swim-
ming on the team really mean a lot 
to her," McGihon said.

comes first, then the Guardian. 
Many of us also have additional 
employment so we can pay the 
rent. 

Because of these things, it is dif-
ficult to get every scoop, to get 
someone at every home game. But 

. we try. God knows we try. 
To those non-coaches and non-

players affiliated with the athletic 
department who constantly gripe 
about our coverage: 

How many classes are you tak-
ing right now? Oh yeah, zero. How 
many jobs do you have? Oh yeah, 
one. How many years of experience 
do you have? Oh yeah, decades. So 
get the hell off our cases when we 
don't perform like supermen. 

I am sorry this last column is so 
negative -I just had to get that off 
of my chest. Overall it was a great 
time, and like I said, I liked 95 per-
cent of the people ( dealt with. 

So this is goodbye. I really loved 
the time here. I will miss all of the 
great players and coaches. Thanks 
again. I will take these experiences 
wherever ( go. 

Nicole Ostrin was an integral 
part to the diving squadron who 
will be missed. 

Taylor Mitchell was something 
of a mother figure to her team-
mates, according to McGihon. 

"( know she'll hate to hear this, 
but she was like the team mom.· he 
said. "She was a real mentor to the 
younger swimmers, and was just 
the nicest person on the team, 
almost to a fault. A little bit of killer 
instinct might have helped her out 
some, but she was just the nicest 
person and helped out everyone on 
the team." 

The coaches and teammates of 
these players would all agree that 
all of these athletes brought some-
thing unique to the pool and will 
be leaving behind some pretty darn 
big pairs of speedos to fill.

Thursday, June 7, 2001 

As the UCSD sports season 
wraps up, lots of attention has 
been given to the major intercol-
legiate sports. But there are other 
teams that are wrapping up their 
season as well, namely the UCSD 
club sports teams. 

This eclectic group of teams 
competed all year long while 
keeping a commitment to having 
fun and building friendships. 

The newest sports club, bad-
minton, started the year off strong 
with a second-place finish in a 
match against UCLA and UC 
Irvine. The team maintained its 
level of success throughout the 
year and closed its season at the 

NCAA Badminton National 
Tournament in Philadelphia, 
where the women's team took 
first in the team sections and the 
men's doubles took second place. 

Dancesport had many tOP p'er-
formances throughout the year, 
most notably the Day by the 
Shores Competition in which the 
formation team took first place. 
Dancesport also competed at the 
Stanford Classic Competition 
where the .alumni team, the for-
mation team and the show team 
made a clean sweep of first, sec-
ond and third places, respectively. 

No one could question the 
endurance of the UCSD cycling 

The UCSD Guardian 

team: Its cyclists biked up to 90 
miles in a single competition. 
The team finished fifth in its con-
ference, but was unable to quali- . 
fy for nationals. Cyclists Pete 
Knudsen and Sharon Smith were 
admitted to the nationals as inde-
pendents. 

The UCSD competition 
dance team competed in two 
major events for the 2000-01 sea-
son: the USA Nationals in Las 
Vegas, where they placed sixth, 
and the NCAA Nationals in Day-
tona Beach, Fla., where they fin-
ished ninth. 

The equesuian team posted 
several big w~ns during the year 
despite beginning with only five 
returnees from last year's team. 
Heather Thurgood's perfor-
mance in the intem1ediate equi-
tation on the flats and over fences 
earned her the High Point Cham-
pion title. 

The ice hockey team posted a 
10-1-.1 record and repeated as 
Pacific Coast Collegiate Hockey 
Association Champions. Leading 
the team were top scorer Seeven 
Cohen, goalie Scott Friedman and 
assist-leader Andrew Jacobsen . 
Due to its stellar record during 
the past two years, the group will 
have a tougher schedule to take 
on next year. 

Men's lacrosse finished this 
year at 5-1, a turnaround from 
last season's 0-6 record. The team 
finished as West Coast Lacrosse 
League Division A South Cham-
pions. UCSD beat eighth-ranked 
Arizona in league and took down 
Loyola Marymount University to 
win the league championship. 
The team finished the season 
20th in the nation. 

The women's lacrosse team 
didn't have as much luck as its 
male counterpart did because it 
was plagued by administrative dif-
ficulties. With rookies making up 
a majority of the team, the team 
pulled together under its new 
captain, Kabe Pabst, and gained 
valuable experience for next year. 

Men's rugby squared off 
against a lot of tough Division I 
competition. The team came up 
with several big victories, the most 
notable a 25-24 victory over 
UCLA. Captain Brian Kennedy 
was named to the Southern Cali-
fornia Territorial Representative 
team in re.cognition of his out-
standing play. 

Women's rugby finished the 
season in fourth place, a detinite 
accomplishment for the young 
team. The team placed second at 
the Champage Classic and, after 
being able to score only once in

Women's Water Polo Captain ·Moves On 
Hilary Smith is forced to part ways with the polo team due to graduation 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Sell/or Staff Writer 

Captain Hilary Smith is the lone 
senior on the 2000-2001 UCS D 
\\'umen 's water polo tea m, and she 
will be pursuing a career in politics 
after graduating this year. 

Smith , who was raised in Sa n 
Diego, accomplished some solid 
senior-year numbers fo r th e sq uad. 

She was fi ft h on the team in 
goals and she placed th ird on the 
team in assists. wi th 16. Smith also 
carne in second for the Tritons in 
steals wi th 38. 

This season has been especially 
tough for Smith due to a torn 
labrum, which will requIre surgery 
during the summer. Even wi th the 
injury, Smith played wel l and didn 't 
allow the pain to bother her. 

"She did not complain ," said 
head coach Larry Sanders, "She 

was true to herself. She just did it." 
Smith has been voted to the AlI-

Conference second team for the 
last two years and was also voted to 
the All-American first tea m her 
senior year. 

She was th is year's team MVP 
and led the team in ejections drawn 
for the second year in a row. 

"She has what I would call a 
ve ry successful career here," 
Sa nders said . "Hilary has been an 
example both in and out of the 
pool - being the only senior on a 
relatively young team that was, in 
my mind, a year away from being 
successful at th is leve l. But with her 
leadership, they surprised me and 
had a fantastic year." 

The team defeated major Divi-
sion I schools this season, including 
the University of Michigan, Univer-
sity of the Pacific, UC Santa Barbara 
and San Diego State University. 

Smith will graduate with honors 
in political science and is planning 
to move to Washington D.C. to 
work for a congressman. 

"She put in the time for both 
her studies and water polo," 
Sanders said. "Basically she just did 
it, period. She was this year's cap-
tain and through her hard work, 
showed her teammates wha t it 
takes to be successful at whatever 
you choose to do." 

As Smith departs from UCSD, 
she has the blessings of her team-
mates, teachers and coaching staff 
in whatever endeavors she choos-
es. 

"I was honored to have her on 
this year's team and I know that I 
will miss her and that her team-
mates will miss her grea tly: 
Sanders said. "She is what UCSD is 
all about - having a great academ-
ic and sport experience." 

Crew Member Says Goodbye 
Troxil has stroked his last for the UCSD men's crew 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Spor ts EdI tor 

The Tritons ' Steve Troxil is 
graduating this June, ending his 
career as a crew member. 

"He's a good fo ur-year rower," 
sa id men's crew head coach 
Michael Filippone. "Whatever the 
team asked of him, he didn 't ques-
tion. He practiced hard every day." 

Though he was not necessari ly 
a star, Troxil had his highlights. He 
was a member of this year's varsity 
fou r boat that took first place at the 

DOMINO'S DEUVERS To UCSD! 

Newport Invitational. He was also a 
member of the varsity four boat 
that placed third at the Paci fi c 
Coast Rowing q ampionships. 

Las t year, he was a member of 
the va rsity fo ur boat tha t took first 
at the San Diego City Champi-
onships. 

"He's the consummate tea m 
player," Filippone said. "He gave 
100 percent to the tea m all four 
years." 

Troxil brought some much-
needed guidance to this year's 
team. 

"There was kind of a void ," Fil-
ippone said. "There weren 't a lot of 
four-year oarsmen, He was always a 
tea m supporter. He had a couple of 
good races." 

Troxil was a good example to 
th e many youngsters current ly 
manning the boats. He loved row-
ing and did everything for the 
ream's success. 

"He came out fo r the squad 
four years ago," Filippone said . 
"The impact of racing is pretty 
clear. He had an allegiance to the 
team."

Golf: 
Golf team member~ 
will miss Torrey Pznes 
Continued from page A21 

"It was great to be able to walk 
onto the team as a transfer stu-
dent and play," said Langford. 

Among his fondest memo-
ries id traveling to away match-
es with the rest of the team. 

"I'm going to miss the trips 
with the team," Langford said. "I 
remember always having a good 
time on those trips." 

Sullivan, a senior from Escon-
dido, Calif., has been a rock for 
the team throughout his years 
with it. He has consistently per-
formed among the top members 
on the team, proving his senior 
leadership with a solid three-
round score of 226 at the CCAA 
Men's Golf Championship, held 
this year at Hunter Ranch Golf 
Club in Paso Robles, Calif. The 
performance was the second-
highest on the team and was 
good for 16th overall. 

Though these Triton golfers 
will most certainly miss the 
comraderie of the team, they 
will also have to miss being able 
to play at Torrey Pines Golf 
Course as their home course. 
Torrey Pines is one of the top 
golf courses in the world that is 
also home to the PGA Tour's 
Buick Invi tational every year. 

"It was awesome to be able to 
play on Torrey Pines," Langford 
sa id. "It is a great course. One of 
the best in Southern California." 

We wish these dedicated Tri-
tons luck as they leave the cozy 
confines of UCSD and Torrey 
Pines and venture off into the 
real world. May their proverbial 
drives be straight while putters 
remain free of the yips. 

Look out world, here they 
come. Fore!

Team Feels Graduation Pinch 
Eight swimmers will be moving on to bigger pools 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD swim program will 
be missing a mess of players next 
season when it hits the pool. There 
are players of varying capacities and 
with varying impact within the 
UCSD swim program. 

There are leaders, jokers, charac-
ters, nunurers and hard workers 
among them, but many are similar in 
that they've swam their last lap or 
took their last dive in the ll-iton blue 
and gold. 

On the men's side, there will be 
four spots to fill as Rusty Jones, 

Greg Scott, Bryan Villareal and 
Ryan Wong are on their way out. 

Jones was a key component of 
the Triton swim team this year, 
notching numerous, impressive 
finishes and acting as the team cap-
tain. He holds a UCSD school 
record in the 200-meter medley 
relay, and had many other top 
scores over the season. 

Coach Scott McGihon fondly 
recalls of his top performer: "He was 
the hardest worker in the pool. He 
brought grit and determination to 
every workout and will be sorely 
missed by his teammates because he 
was a leader that led by example." 

Villareal did not have as positive 
an effect on the team, but did his 
part to lighten things up around 
the pool, according to McGihon. 

"Villareal brought a girth of 
communication to the team. He 
was always talking, which brought 
a certain sense of levity. But let's 
just say that he was very outspoken 
around the pooL" 

Scott made a bigger impact on 
the Triton swim program, compil-
ing numerous top-10 ran kings in 
both breast stroke categories and 
being named an All-American every

Golf Loses Two 
Langford and Su II ivan say goodbye 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

By the time most college stu-
dents wake up at noon on week-
ends, these guys have already put 
in a full day's work. 

They've been up since dawn, 
smacking ball after ball off the 
dewy grass and into the crimson 
morning skyline. They will con-
tinue until they can no longer 
track their golf balls more than SO 
yards from their swea t-fi lled 
brows. They are the golfers. 

UCSD's golf team is perhaps 
one of the most underappreciated 
teams on the campus. Day-in and 
day-out, Triton golfers put in 
countless hours perfecting their 
craft. 

They putt. chip and swing 
until their muscles ache and their 

minds near exhaustion . Yet. the 
only thing they hear about their 
sport is the ravings of ignorant 
students who shout that, "Golf is 
not a sport. Golf is for sissys." 

These uninformed masses 
have obviously never attempted 
to "just put the little white ball in 
the hole: 

This year the team bids 
farewell to two of its mainstays 
for the past few years, Lenny 
Langford and Darin Sullivan. 

Langford , a senior from San 
Gabriel , Calif., came to UCSD as 
a transfer student two years ago. 
With 10 years of golf experience 
and a one handicap to his credit, 
Langford was able to walk OntO 
the team as a junior. He hasn't 
looked back since.

Dostalek and Saadati Named Athletes of the Year 
The LJCSO Guardian comes out with the top male and female Tritons from the 2000-2001 year 
The UCSD Guardian Female Ath-
lete of the Year 

Her dominating play hdped her team to a 
21-2 record and a Division II championship, 
and the Guardian is proud to name women's 
soccer player Cindy Dostalek as its Female 
Athlete of the Year. 

Dostalek, a forward , was unstoppable on 
th( playll1g fidd. 

She was second on the team with 33 
points and was second in goals with 12. 
She tied for second in assists with nine and 
was also first on th~ team in shots taken 
with 76. Dostalek started all 23 games this 
year. 

Dostalek was recently named UCSD's 
Woman of the Year at the U<;:SD Athletics 
Recognition Night, and she is one of 12 
UCSD Athletes of the Year. 

Earlier this year, she was named to the 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Association 
First Team. 

Finingly, Dostalek concluded her Triton 
soccer career with the winning goal in the 
championship game. 

For her unparalleled accomplishments 
on the field, her honors off the field, her 
dedication to her sport, and her champi-
onship style and aftitude, the Guardian 
sports staff honors Dostalek as the 2000-
2001 Female Athlete of the Year. 

Congratulations Dostalek. 

Honorable Mention 

Leea Harlan, softball: 
As the Tritons' star pitcher, Harlan finished 

the year with a 1.48 ERA, 135 strikeouts and 
a 17-8 record. She was also deadly at the plate, 
batting .274 with 20 RBis and 18 runs scored. 
She was the heart of a determined softball 
team that finished 34-17 overall and just nar-
rowly missed making it to the playoffs. 

Emma Kudritzki , water polo: 
She led team in goals scored with 62, more

than twice as many as scored by her runner-
up. Kudritzki also contributed 25 steals and 15 
assists, helping to lead the Tritons to third 
place in the Women's Western Water Polo 
Championships and a stellar 20-13 record. 

jennifer Watanabe, swimming: 
Watanabe is a perennial Guardian Athlete 

of the Year candidate, having won the award 
last year due to her impressive performance 
in last year's NCAA Championship meet. 
This year, she captured the Division ([ 
National Championship in the 200-meter 
individual medley, 400-meter individual 
medley, the 200-meter backstroke, and was a 
member of the championship-winning 400-
meter medley relay. 

The UCSD Guardian Male Athlete 
of the Year 

Rarely does one player mean as much to a 
team as Bobby Saadati did to the UCSD 
men's soccer team. Because of this and his 
extraordinary play, Saadati has been selected 
as the Guardian Male Athlete of the Year. 

Sadaati kicked 10 goals this year, more 
than three times as many as his next-clos-
est teammate. He also managed to dish four 
assists - second on the team. He was 
clearly the team's leader with 24 overall 
points. 

[f it was game day, Sadaati was there, start-
ing all 18 Triton matches. He carried the team 
to an 11-5-2 record, a California Collegiate 

Ath[etic Conference South Division crown 
and a trip to the CCAA semifinals. Without 
his play, the team would not have enjoyed 
nearly as much success. 

Sadaati, a mid fielder, was named to the 
AII -CCAA First Team and is one of UCSD's 
Athletes of the Year. 

Due to Saadati's leadership and the maul-
ing of his opponents at the Division [[ level, 
the Guardian names him its Male Athlete of 
the Year. 

Honorable Mention 

jason Boettner, water polo: 
The UCSD men's water polo team had 

an outstanding year, earning a national 
ranking and making it as far as the Nation-
al Championship Final, where it unfortu-
nately lost to UCLA. Boettner was a major 
contributor to the team, rack.ing up 45 goals 
and 40 assists -during the season. He also 
garnered 42 steals, by far the most by any-
one else on the team, and was instrumental 
in their fabulous season. 

james Nielsen, track and field : 
Though Nielsen did not have as much 

success this year at Division [[ as he had in 
previous years at Division [[[, he did have a 
great showing. Nielsen captured the title in 
the 5,OOO-meter run at the Cal-Nevada 
Championships and in the CCAA Champi-
onships. At nationals, he finished ninth to 
close out his Triton career. Nielson was also 
named a UCSD Athlete of the Year despite 
being unable to compete in cross country 
due to an injury. 

jonathan Samuels, water polo: 
Samuels was another key component in 

the men's water polo team's national sec-
ond-place finish . He led the team in ~oals 
with 67, which was 22 more than the sec-
ond-highest scorer on the team, and in 
blocks with nine. He also picked up 29 
steals and 7 assists.

There are no journalism classes at

To the guy who sent in a top 10 
list of why Guardian sports sucks: 
That was creative. 1 really liked that 
one. [ have it posted in my office. 
One of the best parts is where you 
call me and one of my associates 
dorks. That has to do with the 
sports content, sure. You don 't 
know us and you're no David Let-
terman. 

Back in March, someone else 
sent me an e-mail criticizing my 
columns. Again, this person had 
some legitimate gripes. But he or 
she - it was unsigned - tried way 
too hard. [ was ripped for a column 
[ did not even write. It was a col-
umn - the one about the Super 
Bowl being less than entertaining 
- that one of my associates wrote. 
See the name and the pic at the 
top? Good job. 

These are all things that upset 
me over the year, but they're not 
too harsh. They obviously both-
ered m.!, but for the most part [ got 
over them. Some of them were 
amusing and provided me with 
cheap entertainment. 

Heck, if any of those three who 
wrote letters were to confront me, [ 
wouldn't mind having coffee with 
them and chewing the fat. No hard 
feelings and all. 

There was something that really 
chapped my hide this year: the 
swim team. 

Now, this is not an attack 
against the entire team. [ met the 
coach and he is a good person. [ 
met some of the team members 
and they too are goo~ people. The 
team obviously kicks ass, especially 
jennifer Watanabe, Sandra Lopez 
and the 400-meter medley team. 
Props to you all. 

But what some of you, or those 
associated with the team this year, 
did was pathetic. You took an 
advertisement out in the Guardian 
personals and ripped one of my 
writers and the department. This 
happened n t just once, but a cou-
ple of times. 

That is weak.

unspectacular, but if you have a

tition included a 
trip as a freshman using fencing 
foil, and as a sophomore using 
fencing saber. Padgitt's conference 
record this year was 34-2. 

MMaytal put more effort into her 
academics, skipping one year of 
competition to concentrate her 
effort there: said fourth-year head 
coach Stuart Lee. "We are glad she 

came back and competed so well 
for our team. 

"johnson srew into a competi-
tively savvy II1dividual who was 
able to bring his game up against 
extremely strong opponents: Lee 

continued. "Padgitt was always 
the team leader in both skill and 
spirit; he will be sorely be 
missed." 

These 'three seniors have 
achieved both academic and ath-

letic excellence throughout their 
careers at UCSD, and it is evident 
that their peers will be rooting hard 
for them to succeed in whatever 
journeys life throws at their 
doorsteps.

Most of the players have also 
been grea t. There have been times 
when I've spoken with an athlete 
and he or she was less than cordial, 
but that is the name of the biz. 
After sweating and busting your 
asses, win or lose, you would chat 
with me. Some of you gave me your 
phone numbers so I could reach 
you. Thanks for the effort. 

Some things were rough with 
the administration, but thanks for 
the help you gave my department. 
Sometimes you really came 
through for us and made our job 
much easier. 

Regrettably, there are some 
coaches I still haven 't met. It's just 
a weird anomaly. There are other 
people I never met, too, but would 
have liked to. Perhaps I will take 
some time before graduating to just 
go and meet them, to say "Hi" to 
the voices I've only heard on the 
telephone. 

Most of the time, I loved this 
job. It pains me to leave it. Never-
theless, it was not all fun and 
games-

There are some things that real-
ly grated me throughout the year 
that I wish to address right now. I 
promise not to use any names, but 
I don 't promise to be nice. 

First, some mail. I love getting 
mail. ( love the feedback. You can 
write me at the Guardian or at 
sports@ucsdguardian.org. Wonderful. 
The nice letters are encouraging. 
The not-so-nice ones are amusing. 

For those who sent me hate 
mail. ( make one request: Please re-
read what you have written so you 
don't look like the fools that you 
are. 

One guy wrote me earlier in the 
year with a number of complaints. 
Many were legitimate, but then he 
ruined it. He said that we at the 
Guardian should take more journal-

Tritons hold thei r 
own In Division II 

DaVid Pilzl Guara,an 

By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Like Captain James T. Kirk did 
on television 35 years ago, the 
UCS D Athletic Department went 
off on a voyage into the 
unknown, visiting strange new 
worlds. And like those on the 
Starship Enterprise who boldly 
went where no man had ever 
gone before, the lriton athletic 
teams also attacked their new 
mission with daring. 

One more similarity between 
UCSD athletes to Captain Kirk: 
They both kicked major ass. 

This was the first year that 
UCSD participated at the Division 
II level. Boy, did it enter the dance 
in style. 

UCSD was in uncharted terri-
tory, but the athletic teams paid no 
mind, dominating the rest of Divi-
sion II. 

In November the UCSD 
women's soccer team won the 
Division II National Champi-
onship. 

The swim team boasted three 
national champions: Jennifer 
Watanabe, Sandra Lopez and the 
400-meter medley relay team. 

The men's soccer team nar-
rowly came up short for the Cali-

forn ia Collegiate Athletic Confer, 
ence crown but still made the 
playoffs. 

The softball team had a 
tremendous year, barely missing 
the conference title and the play-
offs with a 34-17 record. 

Track and field sent six com-
petitors to Division II nationals. 

Both tennis teams made the 
playoffs, as did the women's vol-
leyball team with a 21-10 record. 

The list of accomplishments 
goes on and on. 

"It's been great," said Duncan 
McFarland, head coach of the 
women's volleyball team. "It's very 
challenging. I enjoy the level of 
play." 

The Thtons had great success 
in their 20 years at the Division III 
level, winning over 30 national 
t!tles in various sports. This year 
the school was a new kid on the 
block, and it brought the right 
stuff. 

"Every game gave us a chal-
len$e; said Cindy Dostalek, a 
semor on the women's soccer 
team. "Each game we won was 
more of an accomplishment. 
Every game that we played in Divi-
sion (( compared to Division ((( 
playoffs." 

Many of the Triton teams had 

experience facing top DiVision III 
schools, so playing an average 
Division II program wasn't intimi-
dating. 

"Once we got into the playoffs 
in Division Ill, it was comparable 
to Division II," said McFarland, 
whose team frequently went deep 
into the Division III playoffs in 
previous years. "I felt we were 
already able to be competitive." 

Along with the move to Divi-
sion (( came a move to the Califor-
nia Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion. UCSD had never been a pan 
of a conference before this year, 
opting to be independent, The 
CCM is considered the toughest 
Division II conference in the 
country, 

"We tried to put a lot more 
cffon into recruitmg.· Mcfarland 
said. ~ng to get bigger, better 
athletes-

1\vo benefits of being part of a 
conference is that a team alrea~ 
has set rivals and that a team s 
Schedule, for the most pan, is 
already determined. Independent 
schools must fill in their schedules 
the best they can. . 

"It means I don't have to spend 
two months forming a schedule," 
McFarland said. "As an indepen-
dent, you have to wait for [oppo-

nemsl to form their conference 
schedule." 

Athletes a-nd coaches still per-
formed at their tOP level. 

"We basically played our game 
like we always do," Dostalek said. 
"We kept with what worked for 
us," 

For UCSD to continue its suc-
cess, it needs to keep some things 
intact while also improving on 
others. 

"Just keep UCSD like it is," 
Dostalek said. "Everyone is really 
close and involved in the athletic 
community." 

The athletic department must 
grow with along with the school 
to assure long-term success. 

"We need to tty to keep the 
depanment strong: McFarland 
said. "Money wilf be a critical 
issue. Kids who are interested in 
athletics and UCSD are fairly well-
read. The athletes we need 
respond to a challenge. We need to 
keep up the image of the depart-
ment." 

The year was extremely suc-
c.!Ssful, ·and it is hoped that the 
Thtons will repeat that success for 
years to come. 

"It was very positive for us," 
McFarland said. MAli of the teams 
did a great job."

B2 SPECIAL GRADUATION ISSUE The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 7, 2001 

last words from the Guardian seniors 

Over the last three years, I have 
noticed that the final articles from 
outgoing editors are used primar-
ily for three purposes: to give 
advice, to thank family and 
friends, and to reflect on events 
that have happened to the writers 
throughout their ye~rs at UCSD. 
After thinking about how I would 
use mine, I decided to do all three. 

My advice for the students of 
this school who are not yet in my 
position is simple, and it's advice 
that you have heard from me 
many times throughout the last 
three years. 

It is simply this: You are 
responsible for your own happi-
ness, so take that responsibility. 

It is indeed true that our 
school is somewhat socially chal-
lenged. It is also true that, unless 
you work hard at it, finding a good 
time can be very elusive. But to 
those of you who say that it is 
impossible to have a good time 
here, I say, "Get a life." 

A famous comedian said it 
besl: " If you can 't find something 
10 do, then you aren 't bored, you 
are boring." This couldn 't be 
more true. 

Entertainment doesn't simply 
fall out of the sky. There are a lot 
of times that you have to make 
your own fUll. That's hard to do 
when you're studying constantly 
or going home every weekend. 

I am a management science 
major, so I often put it in terms of 
economics. If you can have fun 
three nights a week as opposed to 
zero nights a week, and end up 
with a GPA that is one tenth of a 
point lower than you would have 
had, I have a hard time believing 
that you don't consider that in 
your best interest. The benefits, as 
far as I am concerned, far out-
weigh the costs. 

I was lucky. I realized that in 
high school, I did way more work 
and stressed way more abo ut 
grades than I had to. I would have 
ended up here with a slightly 
lower GPA and SAT score, but I 
didn't realize that at the time. 
Once I was here, I took that 
knowledge to heart and enjoyed 
my time as much as I could. 

I am goi ng to UCLA law 
school in the fa ll - somewhere I 
have always wanted to go, so I 

bill burger -
don't think that my excessive 
entertainment hurt me too much. 
I have done many things wrong in 
my time here, but that is one of 
the things I did right. 

Another piece of advice origi-
nally came from a Guardian editor 
during my freshman year. I don't 
even know his name and have 
never met him, but I remember 
readi ng his final article. He said, 
and I now repeat, "A life without 
risk is a life that isn't worth liv-
ing." 

Again, being a management 
science major and being in classes 
that repeatedly tell you that risk is 

I have taken many 
chances in my time here, 
and many of them have 
not turned out the way 
tha.t I have wanted, but I 
wouldn't take back any 
of them. In fact, 1 wish 
that I had taken quite a 
few more. 
a bad thing and that humans are 
averse to risk, this is hard advice 
for me to swallow. However, it is 

. very true. If every day of your life is 
a "normal" day, then you are 
doomed to a life of monotony. 

Get out and take a chance. 
Sometimes you will fail and some-
times you will succeed, but in the 
end it's the attempt that will make 
you a better person. I have taken 
many chances in my time here, 
and many of them have not 
turned out the way that I have 
wanted, but I wouldn't take back 
any of them. In fact , I wish that I 
had taken quite a few more. You 
will never expand yourself as a 
person if you never step outside 
yourself and take a chance. 

As far as thanking people, it is 
hard to know where to begin. 

I suppose the first thanks go to 
my parents and family. They sup-
ported me financially and emo-
tionally throughout my time here. 
I have had some of the highest 
highs as well as some of the low-
est lows of my life in the past three 

robert fulton -

years, but my mom, dad , and sis-
ter, Emily, have been there to help 
me revel in the good times as well 
as console me in the bad ones. I 
am eternally grateful to them for 
that. 

I would also like to thank the 
friends I've met here, as well as 
friends such as Aaron, who I knew 
well before college but who also 
played a huge role in my college 
life. After my freshman year, I had 

Illy a few close friends - a si tua-
tion that I was not used to. 

Luckily for me, I was randomly 
paired with my sophomore apart-
mentmate Brendan. We became 
good friends and met other 
friends through each other. The 
result was a group of people with-
out whom I could not have gotten 
through these four years. 

I was talking with my friend 
Joey the other night about how 
odd it was that he and I - a 
Revelle student and a Warren stu-
dent, a political science major and 
a management science major -
have ended up such good friends. 
Alii can say about him, and many 
of my other friends whom I met 
through random chance, is that I 
simply got lucky and am glad that 
I did. 

The last group of people that I 
would like to thank are my 
Guardian cohorts. I always knew 
that I would be thanking you, 
because from the very beginning I 
considered you guys some of the 
most competent and able people 
I've ever met. Whenever work 
needed to get done, there were 
always people there to do it and to 
do it well . 

This was never more evident 
than a few weeks ago when our 
computer crashed at 10 p.m. and 
essentially erased all of our saved 
material. We stayed there until 
nearly 4 a.m. making up for what 
we'd lost. Without the expertise of 
the people there that night, it 
could never have gotten finished . 

I didn't, however, know that I 
would be thanking you guys as 
friends until halfway through this 
year. Until that point,I just did my 
job and left. But when I broke up 
with my serious girlfriend of more 
than a year, I realized how close 
you guys had become. I will 
always owe you all for helping me 
through one of the roughest times 
of my life. 

h is impossible to single any-
one out because you all were so 
great and understanding. I consid-
er that time a blessing because of 
all that I learned and the friends I 
realized I had. 

As far as memorable events, I 
have a hard time narrowing them 
down. This year's Memorial Day 
trip to Las Vegas was possibly the 
best time of my life. I still , and will 
forever, think back and smile 
about that weekend and all the 
fun that my friends and I had 
drinking, gambling, drinking, and 
just basically being menaces to 
society. And drinking, too. 

I can't think about my time 
here at UCSD without thinking 

. See BILL, Page 85 

To whom it may concern: this 
piece will never be truly finished. 

The time has come, the editors 
said, to write of many things. Of past 
glories and future prospects and 
what it is that the present brings. 
Since I was knighted as an editor, I 
need to say "aloha." 

It's aloha because we're saying 
goodbye. to UCSD, but at the same 
time we're saying hello to our next 
step in life. This holds true for all of 
us graduating, but I, of course, write 
this as a member of the Guardian. 

I fondly recall walking into this 
office in September of 1999. There 
was a meeting taking place and pizza 
was strewn all over the floor. I would 
quickly learn the importance of that 
pizza, the sacredness that the hot 
cheese represented for the tired and 
hungry after they put out their sec-

scott burroughs-
We have been through many 

wild and zany adventures during 
these last two years together, and I 
must say that it has been a pleasure 
to have you along for this ridicu-
lous ride. But the time has come 
for the Lounge's splendid era at 
UCSD to come to a close. 

Soon, I shall walk the plank that 
is graduation and march out 
beyond the cozy confines of our 
lazy La Jolla campus to find my for-
tune in the fine world beyond. 

Through the pixellated print 
that composes each Lounge, I have 
done my best to disseminate my 
message unto you, the Triton 
masses. School is school: a place 
where you learn and stuff, but 
whatevers. College is so much 
more than that. It's a time when the 
studying and learning part com-
prises about one-fortieth of the 
total experience, and drinking for-
ties constitutes the rest. 

Personally, I find it hard to 
remember any compelling lecture 
or test, yet my memory is rife with 
instances and recollections of sip-
ping a frosty St. Ides on a warm 
spring day, or gleefully admiring a 
coldie drawn from a recently 
tapped keg, or simplr. knocking 
back a brew or 12 whIle shooting 
the shit or kicking it around town 
with the homies. 

If there's one thing that I have 
learned in my days as a Triton, it's 
that I won't - and you won't 
either, smart guy - ever know any-
thing. Not ever, not anything at all! 
The only thing I've come to fully 
understand is the fact that every-
one is a moron and the heads that 
are actually succeeding in life are 
only doing it through blind, fool-
ish, knee-jerk luck. 

The wheel in the sky indeed is a-
turning. and it will keep a-turning as 
long as any of us are a-breathing. So 
it's best to calmly and coolly subju-
gate oneself to the flowing whims 
and demands of the great, pulsating 
pendulum in the sky, heeding its call 
through the waxing and waning 
moments of your life. 

What on Earth am I jabbering 
about? This ridiculous gibberish 
most definitely will not fly. Where's 
the booze, the drugs, the constant 
references to strange, abstract 
things and ideas that make sense to 
nobody, not even me? 

tions. 
That most sacred thing - pizza 

- was even taken away once last 
year as a punishment. It was like 
taking water away from desert 
dwellers. It got ugly. 

Anyway, I digress. Upon walking 
into the Guardian office for the first 
time that fateful day, I asked then-
spons editor and future buddy Bill 
Burger if he needed a writer. Good 01' 
Bill, with pizza in his face, nearly 
choked at the glory of his savior com-
ing. OK, maybe that isn't exactly how 
it broke down, but he was happy to 
get a writer. I have been thankful that 
he gave me that opportunity. 

We exchanged information and I 
was off on my first assignment - a 
women's· soccer game. I would not 
have had it any other way. The team 
won, and won again, and kept on 

Then again, this whole column 
has been an absurd misadventure 
in frenzied, off-the-wall journalism 
since its advent. Even the title is 
preposterous. 

Lobster's l.,ounge: What does 
that even mean? Yet where else can 
you find such tales of mayhem and 
madness, replete with all the drink-
ing, drugging and dalliance that 
your fragile little dome can handle? 

And how in the world did I, 
Scott Alan Burroughs, ttain the 
righteous and storied privilege of 
hoisting all of these mind-warping, 
life-changing diatribes upon you 
and the UCSD community? 

Well , I'll tell you how: Through 
years and years of grueling, humil-
iating, dehumanizing toil and 
labor, whoring myself out to the 
highest bidder and horribly com-
promising my morals and integrity, 
all in hopes of one day wielding 
this transcendent, omnipotent pen. 

When I finally made it to the 
top of the heap and was given the 
opportunity to clench the trem-
bling Guardian readership in my 
mighty, gloved fist, and the ability 
to wreak havoc al'ld spur great, 
sweeping social changes, I instead 
chose to talk abo,ut getting all 
drunk and stuff like that. 

Yet it's a year or so later and I'm 
still here, still churning out an end-
less string of hubris and innuendo, 
which is still being ravenously 
gorged upon by the adoring public. 
Or something. 

This piece holds even more, 
however, as there is something of 
actual use to you, though it is . 
ensconced deeply and enigmatical-
ly beneath the surface of this seem-
ingly destination less drivel. The 
message is this: It would greatly 
behoove you, the hung-over 
Lounge reader, to clear the crust 
out of your eyes and get out there 
and go something. Go out into that 
bright sunlight that peeks into 
your window as you play another 
round of Tetris, and do something 
with yourself, you worthless, 
slovenly bum. 

Join a group or club of some 
sort - AA comes to mind - and 
get involved. 'It is possible to crawl 
out of bed before nightfall on a 
regular basis, I hear. You could the-

winning until they won the national 
championship that year. Of all the 
beats to be assigned to, I got the best 
one. _ 

I quickly moved into an editor-
ship, with the section all mine this 
year. It has been one of the best 
experiences of my life. I covered 
many sports in my two years here at 
UCSD - almost all of them. 

I hav'e met some great people. 
The coaches have been wonderful 
to me, as have most of the; players. 
There have been a handful of angry 
letters, but most of them are amus-
ing. The positive letters, though few 
and far between, are encouraging. 

I also learned how to deal with 
dicks, and I don't mean Richards. 
The true dicks were few and far

Get Into the Summer 
Music Festivities 
Expect to spend a bu nch of money

Awww, the dog days of summer! 
For many people, summer means 
frozen lemonade, sunburns and 
Lollapalooza. Oh wait, that was so 
six years ago. 

At least you can still catch the 
lovely ladies of Lilith Fair. Oops, my 
mistake. That ended about three 
years ago. 

Hey, there is always the This 
Ain 't 0 Picnic festival. Actually, all 
you indie rock kids will have to find 
something else for this Fourth of 
July, because that's out of the pic-
ture, too. 

OK, so the summer festival cir-
cuit is not what it once was, but 
there· are still some shows making 
their way across the country this 
summer just in time for you to 
spend your hard-earned cash on 
overpriced T-shirts.

than a diploma, a sunburn and a 
book of e-mail addresses that they 
will maybe one day open to forward 
a slew of really funny' jokes to their 
old college pals, whtle holed up in 
their little hovel of a cubicle, wear-
ing· a stained, wrinkled shirt or

You have plenty of time to be a 
loser, so get down with something 
now, while you still can . I used to 
think that stepping a less-than-
mandatory foot on the UCSD cam-
pus was an experience akin to eat-
ing flaming shards of glass. 

Now I genuinely enjoy spending 
large chunks of my free time work-
ing at the fine, on-campus offices 
of the Guardian. That is, as· long as 
there is a large and steady supply of

The UCSD Guardian SPECIAL GRADUATION ISSUE B3 

............,.~ Iast words from the Guardian seniors~""""""'" 

---vincent gragnani~ 
It all hit me last week. As I was 

trying to make sense of the past 
fou r years of my life, all hell was 
breaking loose at the Guardian. 

Our hiatus editor, as well as his 
4,OOO-word front-page story, was 
missing in action and showed up 
over 24 hours late due to personal 
issues. 

Our opinion editor received a 
much larger section than she 
expected and was scrambling to 
write last-minute articles to fill the 

space. 
Two news stories that we 

expected writers to turn in did not 
come in as expected. 

And our spons editor was twO 
hours late coming in after saying 
goodbye to his fiancee, whom he 
won 't see for three months. 

As this drama unfolded, ·1 real-
ized that this was the kind of situ-
ation that I thrive on. Yes, I was 
actually enjoying the fact that 
everything was going wrong. 

Throughout the years, 
You 've had so many fears 
Of challenges and tests, 

Sleepless nights with no rest. 
Many memories of fun-filled days, 

Why? Well , some people may call 
it masochism,. but they don't 
understand the situation . 

I may have looked stressed at 
the time-and I probably was-
but I also knew that everything 
was going to turn out OK in the 
end. In fact, I think tht: issue 
turned out to be one of our best 
this year. 

How did that happen? 
Everyone pulled tOgether to get the 
job done and they got it done well. 

That is one of the greatest 
things about the Guardian. We are 
a bunch of students committed to 
the paper and committed to each 
other. When things go wrong, 
everyone docs their part to fIX 
things. As editor in chief, it gives 
me great joy to see this - not just 
when things go wrong, but every 
day. 

Looking back at the goodbye 
columns of past editors in chief. I 
noticed a lot of bitterness and 
negativity. Some had issues with 
their staffs, others felt that the 
Guardian had taken their lives 
away. 

My take is just slightly differ-
ent. I love my staff to death and I 
love what the Guardian has done 
to my life. The only bitterness 

See VINCENT, Page 84 

Otherwise, it's pure, excruciat-
ing agony, somewhere along the 
lines of disembowelment, or 
Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Have you 
seen "Down to You?" Blech! 

When all is said and done, as it 
almost now is, the Guardian has 
been good to the 01' Lobsterman. It 
provided me with an outlet for my 
"work: an opportunity to ridicule 
and belittle the work of others, and 
a big, fat check !:Very other week so 
I can buy more booze and the cycle 
can continue; the wheel can keep 
a-turning. 

Now it's time to go your separate ways. 

Now, though , that great big 
alcohol-greased wheel is grinding 
to a halt, and once again I would 
like to thank you all for your mind-
less questions, your suggestions 
that I ignored, your endless chat-
tering, your less-than-profound 
thoughts, and of course, for all of 
the times you've mentioned that 
the mere chance of there possibly 
being a Lounge in that day's issue 
is the only reason you pick this rag 
up at all . 

For all of that and more, word up. 
Just keep the drafts flowing, the 

tunes loud and the slougulent way 
of life alive and well. Keep bangin'. 
OUI. 

Four years of hard work have opened many doors ... 
Good luck in the future, success will be yours!

B4 SPECIAL GRADUATlON ISSUE The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 7, 2001 

last words from the Guardian seniors 
.. 

===~~-david lee -
Soundtrack to this article -

Rob Swift: "Modern Day Music." 
These salutes are bullshit. But 

then again, what better way to end 
my stay as hiatus editor than to fin-
ish where I started. 

That's not to say I haven't 
improved over the past three years 
at the Guardian. The quality of my 
defecation has earned me six 
California Intercollegia te Press 
Association awards. But little gold 
plaques don't mean shit. Quite lit-
erally. 

What convinced me was seeing 
the 4120 issue hanging on the wall 
of a freshman res. hall with "the 
shit" tagged five times under the 
italicized titl e, Bum Baby Bum. 
Boom: proof-positive. Or a past 
writer calling me from New York to 
let me know his portfolio got him a 
job with the "Villager." Strolling 
down the copper scales of the 
Geisel Snake to the aerial view of 
sold-out kiosks. Lounging students 
flipping through the crazy lives of 
two escorts. Then to a Tengu 
sword-wielding ninja. An interview 
with Spike and Mike. Chuck D. 
Steven Hager. But [ aigress. 

[ found the biggest compliment 
and sense of fulfillment from the 
readers. Anyone involved in any-
thing creative can relate to the thrill 
of others seeing and appreciating 
your work, your ever-consuming 
baby. And that was probably my 
main failure as a journalist. 

[ pissed on AP style. [ never 
exposed a political scandal, covered 
a soccer game or even supported an 
editorial during my time at the 
paper. However, I'd also like to 
mark that as an ethical saving grace 
(i.e. Guardian endorsing Bush). I 
was an artS and entertainment edi-
tor. I entertained; that's what [ did. I 
just had my own way of doing it. 

So instead of theater, we 

Vincent: 
Guardian days taught 
Chief importance of fun 
Continued from page 83 
and negativity you will hear from 
me will be about the fact that I 
have to leave th is place. 

If there are two things that I 
have learned in the past four 
years, they are how to be a jour-
nalist and how to have fun . While 
it sounds more professional for an 
edi tor in chief to mention jour-
nalism before fun , I need to talk 
about fun first . 

When I came to the Guardian, I 
had just graduated with a 4.3 GPA 
from a private high school. [ had 
enjoyed my high school years, but 
not nearly as much as I would 
come to love my college years. 

My first two years at UCSD 
were in fact similar to high school, 
minus the good grades. I didn't 
party much and [ didn't touch 
alcohol very often: A lot of that 
changed when [ started working in 
the Guardian office as an editor. 

At the Guardian , [ have met 
friends that I hope will last me a 
lifetime, We spent a lot of time 

brought you anime. Buds over 
beer. Sex workers rather than 
strippe.rs. Blazed with Wyclef. 
Supported DiFranco, Harper, 
Ozomatli and JS . Burning Man 
over Massives. Marathons in 
Morrocco. Vancouver Spring 
Breaks. Oktoberfest in Berlin. 
Grooves to get busy to. And music 
major co-eds shooting shotguns 
in the desert night sky. We were, if 
anything, eclectic. 

There were lots of times when 
divine dispensation could have 
fixed some major blunders. But, 
for the most part, I steered this 
tiny vessel with my own selective 
style and vision to the best of my 
ability, which is the most any edi-
tor can hope for. 

Fortunately, hiatus leaves a 
greater wake with a small treasure 
of writers, photographers, graphic 
artists and designers. And working 
under my quasi-fascist rule has 
most assuredly given them enough 
penance to pass through the Pearly 
Gates or be reborn a Hindu cow. 

Consequently, I have particular 
faith in next year's hiatus staff 
with Charlie Tran and Joe Lee at 
the helm.There couldn't be any-
one so opposite from my own 
vision and way of "working," and 
yet there isn 't anyone else [ would 
want running the show. They've 
grown from enthusiastic young 
men into jaded and cynical 
hounds. I couldn't be prouder. 

Charlie: When journeying into 
the night, remember who you are 
and remember who they are. 

Joe: The music will come. It's 
already there. 

Charlie and Joe: The final mon-
key's off your back. TIme to m~ke 
this your own. Good luck boys. 

[n conclusion, I have no final 
conclusion. [ thank the staff. It's 
been fun, guys. [ shall keep in 

together, not just working, but also 
partying and having a good time -
whether at Bill's, Josh's, or Charlie's 
apartment, or the Flamingo Hilton 
in Las Vegas. 

[ have also learned to have fun 
on my own. Over winter break, [ 
traveled the United States and 
Canada by train, covering over 
8,000 miles of track across 14 
states and five Canadian provinces. 
As much as [ love my life in San 
Diego, it was good to get away, and 
I'm considering doing it again after 
graduation. 

The bottom line is that every-
one needs to learn to have fun . 
Most people already do, but many 
do not. Learn to prioritize. If your 
professor is asking you to drop his 
class during sixth week because 
you're slacking, then maybe you 
are having too much fun , 

But othwwise, don't let grades 
get in the way of having . a good 
time h~~ College is a unique time; 
it should not be taken too serious-
ly. 

Looking back on the last four 
years, [ know for certain that I 
enjoyed myself and that I will prob-
ably remember these years as some 
of the best years of my life. 

Now for the other great thing [ 

touch with those who allowed me 
into their lives and friendships. 
And for those 1 didn't get along 
with - fuck you very much. 

As fo r the reader, allow me to 
entertain you one more time with 
my last act as hiatus editor. At the 
end of each article, my primary 
goal was not to leave the reader 
with some pervasive truth or con-
trived dogma, but to simply end 
on a "note." An abstract lingering. 
A simple hmm. This reqL!ires a) a 
good story, b) dynamic design, c) 
brevity, d) strategic juxtaposition 
and e) tlow. 

Allow me to tloat once more 
and serve you this last story. [ like 
to think of all these salutes as 
tombstones for past editors. 
Morbid, but true. And thus, [ offer 
my epitaph. [t has been an unduly 
honor. [ thank you.

---~--david pHz-
The end of the year has come 

again, and [ have in front of me a 
huge stack of negatives. So much is 
captured on these negatives: happi-
ness, sadness, joy, elation, anger 
and worry. Being a photographer 
for the Guardian has given me these 
moments, and [ have been there, 
for the past two years, observing 
and documenting all that goes on 
at UCSD. . 

[ have seen the women's basket-
ball team sink a three-pointer at 
the buzzer, clenching victory for 
the Tritons. [ have seen a snowball 
fight on the Revelle field. [ have 
seen the overjoyed faces of the slate 
members who swept all the A.S. 
positions. [ have seen countless 
protests and concerts. [ have been 
to more sports games this year than 
anyone else. 

For the past two years, photo-
journalism has been the very core 
of my existence. [t is my passion -
[ can't imagine not being a photo-
journalist, professional or not. [t 
allows me to observe the world and 
see all aspects of life. [t allows me to 
see the differences between people 
and how they live. [t allows me to 
stop the world for a tiny fraction of 
a second, so [ and others can reflect 
on that moment. 

College is a weird phenome-
non. [t is this short period of your 
life that acts as a buffer zone 
between your childhood and your 
adulthood, [t is a place where 
your whole world is set up for 
you, and you have the freedom to 
explore your interests, whatever 
they may be. 

1 can honestly s.ay that, come 
next Saturday, [ will have fully 
taken advantage of my college 
experience. [have spent the past 
four years trying new things, all the 
while having a truly great time. 

The heart of my college experi-

that had been closed to us and pro-
ceeded to do our work as journalists. 

This year, I have been named in 
The San Diego Union- Tribune and 
featured on "Fox 6 News" after the 
Guardian rejected an advertisement 
that we did not want in our paper. 

Little did [ know when we 
decided not to run the ad that we 
would get so much attention for it. 
The more [ learn about this issue, 
the more [ realize that we, as a staff, 
did the right thing. Although [ was 
somewhat nervous about being in 
the spotli~ht, I was proud to defend 
our deciSion in front of all of San 
Diego. 

I have learned a lot while here, 
especially from past editors, and 
now it is my tum to leave and 
become one of those past editors. 
. Whi.le my time here is over, my 

time With these people, I hope, is 
not. I have made lifelong friends 
here, and I'm happy to be taking a 
job just a few miles south of 
UCSD. [ hope to write for The 
Southern Cross, a newspaper pub-
lished by the Catholic Diocese of 
San Diego. This will enable me to 
continue writing in a small-news-
paper setting and to brilig my 
faith into my work. [ am s.ad to 
leave, but [ look forward to what 

ence, though, has been working at 
the Guardian . [ have definitely 
devoted more time and energy to 
the Guardian than anything else, 
as has everyone else who works 
here. 

[t is simply wonderful to work 
in an arena (man, I am so sick of 
the word "arena") with people who 
are as passionate about what they 
do as [ am. My co-workers are 
some of the smartest, most open-
minded people [ know. We take our 
work seriously, but at the same 
time we know that life is about cre-
ating memories that will stay with 
us forever. 

Working at the Guardian is a 
learning experience, as well. I am 
very fortunate to have worked 
under the previous photo editor, 
Lisa Huff, who is not only a won-
derful photographer, but a great 
teacher as well. [ have tried my best 
this year to be as nurturing to my 
photo staff, all of whom have pro-
gressed immensely since the begin-
ning of the year, and of whom I am 
very proud. 

[ thought, upon entering 
UCSD as a freshman who was 
clueless about what he wanted to 
do, that by now [ would know 
exactly where [ was headed. After 
four years of thinking, [ have 
finally come to the conclusioll 
that . I will probably never know 
what I want to do. [f [ did, I would 
have figured it out by now. 

So who knows what is in store 
for David Pilz? I am. consoled by 
the fact that no matter what, [ will 
always be taking pictures, trying 
to document how [ see the world. 

To Lyon, the person to whom [ 
am passing the proverbial torch, [ 
am confident that you will be a 
great photo editor next year. As 
long as you keep your heart in this 
job, you are sure to succeed. 

the coming years have to offer. 
Now, looking back, [ have to 

offer some thanks, first of all to 
God. You've made this a smooth 
ride so far, and while I haven't 
always understood or agreed with 
the bumps in the road, [ now see 
that there was a higher purpose. 
Now ,if [ could only understand the 
higher purpose behind me having 
to graduate and leave this place. 

I have to thank my family for 
being supportive of me every step 
of the way. I may never be around, 
but [ do appreciate your help, 
encouragement andilll you have 
done and continue to do. 

Lastly, [ have to thank my 
Guardian coworkers. You're 
dependable, you 've enabled me to 
do my job with minimal stress and 
you've made this a fun year - one 
I can never forget. You have all 
taught me a lot, and [ leave this 
place a much different person 
because of you. 

Alison and Jeff, [ have all the 
confidence in the world in you 
two. [ wish you the best as you 
take the reins. And to the rest of 
you: It's been one hell of a year. I 
hate 'to see it go, and [ thank you 
all for making this one of the 
greatest times of my life,

last words from the Guardian seniors 
this school doesn 't have the stuff 
that "Animal House" was made of, 
but there is a sense of greatness on 
this campus that I have always rec-
ognized. Here we have a university 
entering its fifth decade, and we are 
th.: future alumni that will make or 
break this school's emerging repu-
tation as a great institution. 

Regardless of whether you start-
ed your college career here, are a 
transfer student, or are just truck-
ing away part-time, college is a sort 
of bubble that protects us from 
truly experiencing the harsh reality 
of the "real world." Here we 
encounter some of the most intelli-
gent people that we may ever come 
across.

opportunity to blossom, but pro-
tected from those that would pre-
vent our growth. This is where we 
learn that if you don't stand up for 
something, you'll stand up for any-
thing. BUI here is also where we 
learn that believing anything too 
extremely requires purposefully 
ignoring half of the information 
available. 

As we head imo the real world, 
we have to look back and think 
about what our experiences at 
UCSD will contribute to our lives.

jessica scheppmann -
It is their tolerance, motivation 

and intelligence that personally 
inspired me to aim for greatness. 
When [ enter the real world and 
begin to encounter the drudgery 
and bureaucracy of closed-minded 
people, [ will have to make sure that 
[ do not lose the optimism that I am 
trying to convey today. 

School these days, especialiy 
here, isn 't about learning a trade. 
Theoretically, you could go all the 
way through UCSD and not learn 
one marketable skill. This is an 
institute of higher learning, not ITT 
Tech. So it becomes an opportunity 
to grow and to educate yourself, not 
just get a degree. 

For my first year in the major, I 
walked around constantly angry at 
the injustice that I saw and felt. 
Eventually, I learned that being 
pissed off all of the time isn 'l the 
solution. There was yet another 
side to the equation thai [ had to 
think through for myself. 

Graduation from college for 
many people can be likened to 
being on the brink of something, 
only you're not quite sure what. 

For some of us it is greatness. 
For"some it is failure, and for others 
it is a nervous breakdown. 

Regardless of the outcome, 
graduation is a rite of passage and a 
culmination of the opportunities, 
experiences and lessons of the past 
years. These days, we're entering an

about my first true love, Ingrid. 
Although things didn't work out 
the way that we had hoped they 
would, I wi\[ always be grateful to 
her for all that she taught me about 
life and love. I am truly a different 
person for the experience. She 
taught me that although love 
sometimes hurts terribly, the good 
times make it all worth it. 

Finally, to bring all of the three 
parts of this article together, [ relate 
something that happened during 
sophomore year. This was the time 
immediately before I began dating 
Ingrid and a time when [ had to 
make a decision between her and 
one of my close friends. Despite all 
the derogatory sayings that tell you 
to choose otherwise, [ chose the 
girl. [n spite of the heartache that [ 
felt after the breakup and the pain I 
felt when [ realized [ would never 
see my friend again, [ would never 
and could never make a different 
choice. 

The advice part of the story is 
this: There wi\[ be certain times 
when you have to make a choice 
because you can't make it any other 
way. You have to choose that way 
because your life would never be the 
same if you didn 't. During these 
times, it is important to make the 
choice you know that you have to 
make. I would never have forgiven 
myself if [ had chosen the opposite 
way and was sitting here today won-
dering if this person that I knew I 
loved could truly have been the one. 

The thanks part of this Story goes 
out to family and friends who sup-
ported me even though my decision, 
from the outside, may have looked 
morally questionable. Even though 
this was the case, they understood 
that I really had no choice and that [ 
had to be true to myself. 

The retlection part is obviously 
remembering the story and ponder-
ing the apology I wish I could give 
for the pain that [ caused my friend 
two years ago. [ truly meant no 
harm, but in a choice between hurt-
ing a friend and eternal questioning 
of myself, [ felt I had no other choice. 

[ hope that when [ leave, you 
can use these words to improve 
your own time here at UCSD. [ also 
hope that you make the best of 
your time at this school, because

rools to make an educated decision 
that you become a more conscien-
tiOUS ci tizcn and human being. 

Critical gt:nder studies is a pro-
gram where students may not learn 
a trade, but learn how to write, 
communicate effectively, argue, 
and cri tically engage and question 
"truth ." 

It was here that I found a facul-
ty that hadn 't been disillusioned by 
bureaucracy. I found a subject that 
I am passionate about, and they 
find sllldents who truly want to 
learn . It is an almost equal trade 

My articles va ri ed in theme, 
including racy subjects like drugs 
and sex, but somehow tended to 
focus on issues like racism, sexism, 
hate crimes, homophobia, feminism 
and women's issues. These were 
topics I cared about and perhaps 
that is why the articles stood out. 

One in particular, an opinion 
article that I wrote in response to 
those people who would argue that 
thcre is no place for feminism in 
today's society, seemed to strike a 
chord. It was picked up by some 
on-lin\! newspapers and won an 
award, which was nice, but the most 
significant and rewarding thing was 
how it affected one reader. 

One of the editors at the 
Guardian told me that not only had 
one girl cut out my article and sent 
it to her friends, but that she want-
ed to meet me and talk about it. 

where we are able 
to nurture each 
other, and truly 
maximize what 
education is sup-
posed to be about. 

It was under the 
tutelage of these 
teachers, and espe-
cially professor 
Rosemary George, 
that some of the 
CGS students and I 
organized a student 
group called 
Women Inciting 
Social Change and 
a conference to 
share the knowl-
edge and ideas that 
we found so inte-

If that girl had 
been the only per-
son in the world to 
read that article, I 
wouldn't care, 
because I would 
know that I had 
made a difference 
and written some-
thing that spoke to 

. someone. I may not 
have represented 
the views of every-
one at the 
Guardian, but I did 
speak for myself 
and the few others 
who saw the world 
the way I did . And 
that is pretty cool. 

gral to a well-
rounded academic career. 

The knowledge 
that I had a voice 
on this campus, 

and that I had a forum with which 
I could share my opinions, has 
been magical. Regardless of what 
was going on in my life, this was 
something that I have always been 
able to count on. 

I will quickh' admit 
that the Guardian 
has a bad reputation 
on campus-
possibly well-
deserved -for being 
too conservative or 
Republican, but I 
always tried to make 
sure that my articles 
and my section 
reflected a different 
perspective. 

If it was in critical gender stud-
ies that I found my voice, it was at 
the Guardian where I was able to 
test how loud I was willing to yell 
for the things that I believed in. As 
the features editor for three years, I 
found myself, and my will, tested 
many times. 

While I was figuring out the 
power that journalism can wie ld, I 
also met the people who guided me 
toward accomplishing my goals. 

Grace Jang, my predecessor, 
taught me1he value of one person's 
voice. She showed me that one per-
son can make a difference. It was 
under her tutelage that my bound-
aries were tested, and where theo- . 
retical feminist beliefs were put 
into practice. 

I will quickly admit that the 
Guardian has a bad reputation on 
campus - possibly well-deserved 
- for being too conservative or 
Republican, but I always tried to 
make sure that my articles and my 
section reflected a different per-
spective. It was possibly because of 
this discrepancy in ideologies that I 
was able to find out exactly how

may let you down. Death , tragedy 
and heartache may strike, but all 
have been overcome with the 
knowledge that regardless of what-
ever else happens, I have something 
to say and the power to say it. It is 
one of the few things, besides 
myself, that has never let me down, 
and it provided the continuity that 
I needed to get through the uncer-
tainty that is inevitable at this age. 

Although I hesitate to speak for 
other edi tors, I do not think that I 
am the only one who fee ls this way. 
Reading through the senior salutes 
of the past three years, you might 
not find a common thread other 
than the Guardian. 

Some of these seniors were dis-
illusioned, some were scared, some 
were excited and some were appre-
hensive about the future. But 
regardless of the emotions they felt

Looking back on three years 

of the Guardian brings many 
memories, successes and 
headaches to mind. Having spent 
all but one quarter with the 

Guardian , my undergraduate exis-
tence has been defined by the late 
Sunday and Wednesday nights 
that inevi tably spawn the online 
edition of the university newspa-

-------tom Vu -
Graduation. Damn, it feels 

good to write that word. Never 
before has it held so much mean-
ing for me. 

Four years of blood, sweat and 
tears culminate now. And it's a 
long time coming. Twelve quar-
ters, nine months as opinion edi-
tor, five flunked classes, two 
majors, one minor, a lot of 
friends, too many drinks and too 
many hours wasted studying, yet 
still not enough. Add them all 
together and what do you get? 

A hell of a lot of memories. 
Some of my best memories 

come from the time I've spent 
here at UCSD. There are just too 
many to relate in the space I am 
given to write this article. It seems 
to me that the happies t memories 
are sometimes the ones that seem 
the most trivial or least impor-
tant. 

If someone were to ask what 
my best memories of my tour of 
duty here are, I doubt I would 
pick one earthshaking event in 
my life. 

Instead, it would be the time 
when I spent th e day with 
Rebecca, Derrick and Pearl at 
Fashion Valley and then went to 
Barona Casino later that night. 

It would be studying with 
Kathy for Economics 111 at the 
Goldfish and then walking along 
La Jolla Cove. 

It's driving up and down 
Miramar Road countless times 
with Ken, in vain attempts to buy 
furniture for our apartment. 

It's baking cookies with Chika 
without enough ingredients. 

It's Peigi sleeping in my room 
because she was too scared after 
watching "What Lies Beneath." 

It's spending time with Aya, 
my favorite transfer studeat, at 
the Living Room and at the cliffs 
overlooking Blacks Beach. These 
are ' the little things in life that 
make it memorable. 

On the flip side, the worst 
experiences are the ones that 

per. 
I vividly remember my 

thoughts walking into this univer-
sity on the first day and wonder-
ing how the newspaper might play 
into my higher education. 

The Guardian orientation fliers 
that I discovered a month earlier 
advertised for writers, designers 
and, much to my delight, comput-
er personnel. I busily prepared my 
resume and cover ' letter, hoping 
that the right combination of 
words and experience might earn 
me a spot among the illustrious 
Guardian sta ff. 

This preparation and determi-
nation to earn a mea~er computer 
position was met with an unex-
pected surprise. The editor in 
chief at the time took my resume, 
gave it a quick once over and said, 
"looks good - can you come in 
Wednesday?" It was both anticli-
mactic and a relief; easily the most 
informal job interview of my life. 

I was to be the Web editor, a 
somewhat ambiguous position 

stick in my mind. 
Lynn crying in my arms on my 

birthday; eating breakfast with 
Samantha at the IHOP in down-
town La Jolla, barely able to swal-
low my eggs as she tells me what 
she had thoughts of doing. 

It's watching my grandfather 

As Trent in "Swingers" 
so eloquently put it, 

'~nd they growns up, 
and they growns up and 
they growns up. " When 
did I realize that I was 
"growns up"? It was 
when my roommate 
Brian commented on the 
"big boy" pants I had 
bought from Banana 
Republic for the job fair 
last quarter. 
wither away; it is watching my 
grandmother slowly walk up to 
his casket with her cane to look 
upon her husband of 70 years for 
the last time. 

These are the moments that, 
regrettably, also made my tenure 
at UCSD memorable. 

"Life is just a series of 
moments: said Bartleby, played 
by Matt Damon in the movie 
"Dogma." "Why don't you seize 
yours?" 

While I am not about to run 
off with a tin can full of coins to 
buy myself a new dress like the 
nun did after talking to Bartleby, 
I grudgingly admit that the ban-
ished angel has a point. That is 
what life is: a series of moments 
that, in aggregate, make up our 
life and our history. 

The secret to enjoying your 
college moments and to under-
standing them is to learn some-

involving Web qesign, computer 
support and, above all, many late 
nights by myself in a quiet 
Guardian office. 

As I grew into the position, I 
realized the latitude and creati vi ty 
that such a job allows. Like many 
aspects of the Internet in general, 
the online edition of the Guardian 
would not be bound by hundreds 
of rules from style books and 
design guides. I did not quite real-
ize its potential until my second 
year in the position, wh en I con-
structed the Guardian online that 
readers see today. 

It was at this point that I came 
to see the Web as a medium in 
which the Guardian could interact 
with its readers more than ever 
before. After enlisting the help of 
several designers and two particu-
larly gifted programmers, the Web 
evolved into a more user-friendly 
and hands-on experience. That's 
not to say that it's anywhere near 
completion. Unlike the final mid-
night deadline of the printed edi-

. thing from them. After all, what's 
the point of achieving something 
- of experiencing a moment in 
life, be it good or bad - if you 
don't learn something from it? 

As some say, people that don't 
learn from history are bouna to 
repeat it. And that, as fantastic of 
a voyage as college has been, is 
the last thing I want to do. 

I have learned so much during 
my time here. I've learned from 
my classes, I've learned from 
working at the Guardian for four 
years, I've lea rned from my 
accomplishments and my defeats. 

I learned from interning . at 
Salomon Smith Barney that 
investing isn't for me. I've learned 
so much about people, friend-
ships ' and about who I am and 
what I want to do with my life. 

I learned about my race and 
ethnicity. I learned about cars. 
I've learned more Than I ever 
could've wanted to about eco-
nomics, about coalition building 
and France's dirigiste model. and 
about the George Foreman Grill . 

In other words, I've grown. I 
think I've grown more in these 
past four years than I ever did in 
the previous 17. After 17 years of 
living with my parents in 
Sacramento, moving to San 
Diego was a blessing. It gave me 
the chance to spread my wings, 
to become my own person, to 
taste life. 

As Trent in "Swingers" so elo-
quently put it, "And they growns 
up, and they growns up and they 
growns up." 

When did I realize that I was 
"growns up"? It was when my 
roommate Brian commented on 
the "big boy" pants I had bought 
from Banana Republic for the job 
fair last quarter. 

Growing intellectually and 
emotionally has its bumps in the 
road. These past four years have 
been anything but smooth. I 
often ask my friends if they have 
any regrets from their time in 
college, yet I never asked myself 
that question , perhaps out of fear 
of the answer. 

Thinking back, I have to 
admit, much to my own chagrin, 
that yes, I have regrets. There was 
a time when I should have said 
"yes' and not "no;" a time when 
the answer should have been 
"no" and not "yes." I certainly 
should have studied for my eco- , 
nomics classes a lot harder than I 
did. 

These things in life are 
unavoidable, though. It's simply 
part of growing up and having to 
make tough decisions. 

The ultimate question, 
though, is not one of regrets. The 
'question is whether a person, if 
given the chance, would go back

tion, the Web provides the oppor-
tunity to continually develop the 
way people see the Guardian. 

Before ending this final printed 
article of my undergraduate 
career, a few thanks are certainly 
in order. First and foremost are 
the editors and staff, past and pre-
sent, of the Guardian, who decided 
to keep me around fQr three years. 

The online edition would still 
be greatly lacking if not for the 
programming abilities of Dean 
Hidas, whose .voluntary contribu-
tions to the site have proven to 
make a world of difference. 

Finally, I would like to thank 
anyone who took the time to look 
at ucsdguardian.org Most editors at 
the Guardian take pride in seeing 
their work being read around 
campus, but the Web staff doesn 't 
always get that humble pleasure 
(not without peeping into your 
dorm windows) . Those of you 
who looked us up online and gave 
some feedback deserve a special 
thanks.

a valuable outlet, it really wasn't a 
sacrifice in the long run . 

I would like to leave you with 
one final thought. I can't take 
credit for it, though. It's some-
thing that my dad, the smartest 
man and most honorable person 
in the world, told me a few years 
ago. 

He said, "It's not that your life 
is hard, it's just that life itself is 
hard. You can't control the fact 
that you will encounter adversity 
in your life. The only thing you 
can control is how you deal with 
it, and how you let it affect you 
and those people around you." 

In finding the key to your own 
soul, you find the strength to 
stand up under adversity. It is this 
strength that makes the difference 
in your ability to protect yourself. 

The secret to maximizing the 
opportunities that UCSD presents 
to us is finding the key that allows 
you to lock this experience and 
strength in your heart forever. As 
much as entering the world minus 
my protective bubble scares me,

the big names you'll find at the

However, if you must spend 
the summer on this side of the 
Atlantic, there is still something to 
be learned from the Brits - beer 
improves every concert experi-
ence! 

because of those experiences and 
the tools that I carry with me, I 
know that I will be OK. 

After four years, and almost 
100 articles later, it's time to end. 
As it has been said, it was the best 
of times and it was the worst of 
times. 

For bener or worse, there are 
many people who have been my 
teachers, who have made an 
impression and who have inspired 
me. These are the people who may 
find a piece of themselves and 
what they have given to me in this 
article. Because of that, they are all 
locked in my heart. . 

To that end, I would like to

and make any changes. Some say this is triv-
ial: What's done is done and cannot be 
changed. True enough, but it hits a not-so-
obvious chord. 

Is the person so satisfied with his experi-
ences that he wouldn't want to go back to 
change things? As I thought about this 
question, I realized that I would not make 
any changes to my career here. 

The moments in my life at UCSD have 
shaped who I have become, and to make 
any changes to the decisions I've made 
would change who I am. I'm more than sat-
isfied with my experiences here - the good 
ones and bad ones. 

I am likewise satisfied with the friends 
I've made and the people I've met. I like to 
say that, between my roommate and me, we 
know half the students here. 

From what I have experienced here, 
friendship breaks down to three things: kind-
ness, trust and loyalty. It doesn 't matter how 
many years two people may have been friends 
- if a little argument can break apart a three-
year friendship, there was no loyalty in the 
first place. The friendship was merely some-
thing of a convenience for the two of you. 

Where can a friendship go without 
trust? Friends trust one another entirely, no 
questions asked. Sacrifices have to be made 
and kindness is a prerequisite. 

Friends are willing to go the distance for 
one another. It's about doing something 
kind because that's what friends do. It's 
doing a favor and not expecting or wanting

sticky situation. At first, I spoke softly and 
carried a big. stick, but I have found it more 
enjoyable to speak loudly and carry a big

. One of my few regrets, which isn't nec-
essarily a regret at all, is that I stayed here 
only twO years. I transferred to UCSD from 
a junior college. It 's a regret because I 
would have loved to have gone to this 
school for four years. I would have loved to 
have lived in the dorms, to have made a 
thousand friends, to have been one with the 
campus. 

I would have loved to have been a part of 
the Guardian for four years. Two years is not 
enough. Hell. four years would not have 
been enough, but it would have been twice 
the time that I did spend here.

anything in return . It can be simply asking 
someone over for lasagna on a lonely 
Thanksgiving weekend. It's meeting a new 
friend late in the school year and knowing 
right away the short-lived friendship is, in 
essence, more true than the three-year one. 

So where do these series of moments 
take me now? It seems like my course in life 
will take me back to Sacramento, where my 
career in politics will start. I'll be working in 
the Capitol. 

Those are my plans, at least. Who is to 
say where my course· in life will take me? I 
surely didn't expect to work as opinion edi-
tor for the Guardian when I first set foot in 
my residence hall all those years ago. I liIid-
n't expect to work· with a great group of 
intelligent people, and I didn't expect to 
have the best weekly opinion section of all 
the colle$e newspapers in California. 

Working at the Guardian has been one of 
the best experiences I ever had; I learned, I 
grew. A huge thank you goes out to all the 
editors and business folk I've had the 
honor of working with. Another thanks 
goes out to the writers I had the honor of 
managing. We couldn't have gotten here 
without you. 

William Shakespeare calls life "an insub-
stantial pageant faded" in "The Tempest." 
He considers life to be "a walking shadow" 
in "Macbeth." A little macabre if you ask 
me. I consider life to be a little more free. 

To all my friends and acquaintances: 
goodbye and thank you . I think U2 said it 
best in their song "Kite": "Who's to say 
where the wind will take you, who's to say 
what it is will break youJl don't know, which 
way the wind will blowlWho's to know 
when the time has come aroundll don't 
want to see you cryll know that this is not 
goodbye." 

innocent in this. I was the instigator of some 
things, the supporter of others, and a mere 
spectator in others. 

There.were times when I should have just 
stayed out of it, chilled with my slacking 
senior self and let things go by. But no, I had 
to voice my opinion. I couldn't leave things 
alone. I said some things this year that I never 
really meant, and I'm sorry. It was one of 
those days, or weeks, or months, you know 
what I mean? 

Would I be happy working here the next 
40 years? Excluding the fact that the pay 
can't cover the bills for a tent on Ihe beach, I 
think I would. I admit that some of it is being 
content with what is familiar.-but it's a really 
enjoyable place. 

This place is home. This is my family. 
These are my brothers and sisters and goofy 
cousins that you shouldn't talk about. 

Yeah , we fight, but what family never had 
their spats? "Grandpa Vince, Lauren won't 
let me use the computer. Aunt Alison, 
Charlie called me a poo-poo head." 

I left home once already, a couple of years 
ago. ow I must leave home again. 

There have been times I have dreaded 
long because of the experi-
tnct:s I had during my time 
that would have otherwise 
been sp~nt here. Those 
experiences right before 
coming to UCSD were 
priceless. 

While my peers were 
wide-eyed freshmen or 
slacking sophomores here 
at the Guardian, I was having 
different experiences that I 
would never exchange for 
all of the money in the 
world.

coming in to work. I 
remember this happening a 
few times this spring when 
times were not nearly as 
chipper. Hell, I had that feel-
ing last week because things 
in my life had a tinge of the 
overwhelming. 

But the feeling of dread 
about coming in was really 
nothing. You know, some-
times you see something you 
normally really enjoy and 
just think, "blah." That 

Because of the limited time I spent at 
UCSD and the fact that I was a transfer and 
never lived on campus, it's safe to say that 
almost all of my friends originate here are at 
the Guardian. I have only a few friends over-
all, and not many of them are non-Guardian 
com padres. This is no accident, since I do 
spend a majority of the time here, workin ' or 
chillin'. 

The fact that most of the people I talk to 
are from the Guardian is in no way a com-
plaint. There are some great people here in 
this office - people I will never forget no 
matter what, no matter how hard I try. OK. 
that was a joke - just a sad attempt at light-
ening the mood. 

Oh sure, the time at the Guardian wasn't 
all fun and games. For every outrageous 

q'~ote that went up On the wall and made us 
all laugh. there was someone complaining 
about something. 

Som~ serious things happened here -
some v.ery unpleasant things. Maybe they're 
not so Imp<Ktant when compared to the rest

cerned, it was big. We had hea:ed meetings, 
trying votes and all-out verbal wars. I'm not 

explains the times I have 
spoken ill of the Guardian. 

I even once considered staying on anoth-
er year ·and getting a second major just so I 
could stay at the Guardian. Part of that was 
political, but part of it was also my love for 
the place. I was thinking emotionally, not 
with my head. Once I started to think with 
my head, I knew it was time to let go, to move 
on. It's time for that next step._ 

Now I must contemplate what the next 
step is; no job, no school, no money. Into the 
great wide open I go with the magic feeling of 
havi ng no place to go. Is this the way the 
world ends, not with a bang but a whimper? 
To all out there, be sure to make sure it is a 
bang. 

As I sit here with a cup of coffee, listen-
ing to John , Paul , George and Ringo in the 
background telling me that "i n the end. the 
love you take is equal to the love you 
make: I take it to heart. I'll see you all later, 
my brothers and sisters, my estranged 
cousins. 

Take the love, make the love. Here's to 
hoping we march yet again down that yellow 
brick road . 

With tear in eye, goodbye.

B12 SPECIAL GRADUATION ISSUE 

During the brief hiatus known as summer, the movie studios 
pull out their big guns and tl)' to score with blockbusters at the 
box office. This summer is no exception. 

"Pearl Harbor" has already exploded onto the screen and 
many more films are ready for release. Summer 2001 could 
prove to be the biggest summer yet, with a handful of sequels 
('oming out, including "Jurassic Park Ill" and "Tomb Raider." 

The films this summer have one thing in common: extrava-
p.1Ce. The stol)' lines are big, the actors are famous and the 
hype is gigantic. Here is a look into the films of summer: 

Starring David Duchovny, Julianne Moore and Orlando Jones 
Plot: A meteor cafl)'ing alien life-forms hits Earth, creating 
havoc and chaos as the aliens adapt to their new environment. 
The new life-forms present a menace to all of mankind, and it is 
up to a small group of scientists to find out what the aliens are 
up to. 
Outlook: Director Ivan Reitman ("Ghostbusters") is a sea-
soned veteran of paranormal comedy and this adventure 
shows his expertise. Crude humor and formulaic jokes are 
abundant, but the movie still brings out some great laughs. 
Rising star Orlando Jones gives this film more comedic life. 
However, obsessed sci-fi fans beware: This comedy is more 
about jokes and parody than staying true to typical alien 
romp. 

Starring John Travolta, Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry 
Plot: One of the world's most dangerous spies, Gabriel Shear 
(Travolta), tries to pull off a heist by stealing money from the 
government. In order to do so, he needs the help of one of the 
best hackers in the world , Stanley Jobson aackman). 

The UCSD Guardian The UCSD Guardian 

Attack of the A quick first look at the films that are 'playing in 
:.I 

o lJ UlJU UlJJ efi ~ J Jj 
Outlook: If you thought "Battlefield Earth" was horrific, then 
seeing Travolta wearing a slim goatee should compel you to 
head to that green sign that reads "exit." This movie knows that 
it is not a thought-provoking drama and does not aim to be one. 
The action and quality of the film are cheesy and will provide a 
quick and forgettable action ride. 

Atlantis· eLo Empire 
Starring the voices of Michael J Fox, James Gamer; jim Vanury and 
Leonard Nimoy 
Plot: Inexperienced cartographer Milo Thatch (Fox) is the key to 
unlocking the mysteries of the lost civilization of Atlantis. Milo 
joins with Captain Rourke (Gamer) and his crew in an expedi-
tion to find the lost city, but their journey brings out surprises 
and mysteries that only Milo can solve. 
Outlook: With increasing competition from other studios, 
Disney is starting to show that its animation department is not 
homogeneous. This is not your typical, all-out musical Disney 
fare; instead expect not only dazzling visual effects, but also 
stunning animation sequences. "Atlantis" has a darker plot 
that will probably be missed by younger audiences, but one 
that will definitely interest mature viewers. This film is a good 
bet if you are tired of Disney films with animals singing tacky 
tunes. 

omb id 
Staning Angelina .folie and Jon Voight 
Plot: Video game heroine Lara Croft aolie) fights villains and goes 
on archeological adventures. Croft's job requires her to go to 

. exotic and dangerous locations to search for missing cl)'pts. 
Outlook: Forget the plot, this isn 't your average Indiana Jones 

outing. This film is dripping with entertainment value. 
The success of Lara Croft in the video game market 
will translate onto the silver screen, and you can bet 
that boys and men will flock to see the scantily dressed 
Jolie. 

• litt e 2 
Stmring Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wilsoll, jeffrey JOIlCS 
and Kevin Pol/ack 

Plot: Once again, Murphy plays Dr. Dolittle, a 
doctor that can speak to animals. On the 
behalf of animals, Dolittle seeks an endan-
gered species in order to save a forest from 
developers. Dolittle also mediates the prob-
lems that arise among the animals as their 
home is threatened. 
Outl ok: Creativity must be at an end in 
Hollywood. The first film was bad to 
begin with, so there really is no need for 
a second film about talking animals. 
With such a ludicrous plot, the movie' 
appropriately uses toilet humor, 
because that is where it belongs. 

Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Rick Yune and 
Jordana Brewster 
Plot: Dominic Torerto (Diesel) plays a cocky racecar driver that 
rules Los Angeles' import street racing scene. Toretto lives in a 
world of ruthless, high-adrenaline driving as he faces his neme-
sis, Johnny Tran (Yune). 
An undercover cop, played by Walker, befriends Toretto to see if 
he is a suspect in a string of big-rig hijackings. 
Outlook: Fast cars and incredible action scenes make this film 
a heart-pumping depiction of street racing. The actors aren't the 
stars of this film: The cars and their engines are. Predictably, the 
plot is stuck in first gear. The stol)'line and acting are incredibly 
weak, but the film provides plenty of action for those who aren 't 
tired of all the other action movies in theaters. 

A.I. 
Starring Haley Joel Osment and jude Law 
Plot: Not much is known about the plot, but Osment plays a 
boy who is not entirely human. He goes on a journey of dis-
covel)' with another member of his kind (Law). 
Outlook: When the project's original director Stanley Kubrick 
passed away, director Steven Spielberg decided to pick it up. 
Following Kubrick's insistence on complete silence on all film 
productions, Spielberg has not released information about the 
plot. It should be interesting to see the twists Spielberg has 
placed on a Kubrick film. 

Scary ovie 2 
Staring Anna. Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Tori Spelling, 
Natasha Lyonne and Tim Curry 
Plot: After the first movie, the entire gang is back when a col-
lege professor (Curry) invites a group of students to his 
haunted house to participate in a sleep disorder study. 
Outlook: Wasn 't evel)'one killed in the first film? Yes, but the 
Wayans brothers are at it again, creating yet another hilarious, 
over-the-top parody. This time, the parody shifts from slasher 
romps to haunted house flicks. Expect the same raucous and 
blunt comedy that made the first movie popular. 

Final Fantasy: The 
p·ri ithin 

Starring the voices oj Ming-Na, Steve Buscemi, Pm Gilpin, Ving 
Rhames, Alec Baldwin and James Woods 

Plot: In 2065, Earth is under siege by-millions of alien creatures 
that attack and destroy anything that is alive. Earth's last hope 
for survival is in the hands of Dr. Aki R ss, who has knowledge 
of spirit waves, which she believes will save the planet. Ald 
encountcrs opposition from the aliens and from General Hein , 
who wants to use a secret weapon to destroy the aliens by 
destroying the entire planet. 
Outlook: This movie is a breakthrough in computer graphic 
effects; the fight sequences are visually stunning, completely 
realistic and lifelike. The details on the faces of the characters 
look as if real actors were used. The stol)' is standard, but the 
visuals make up for it. This is an absolute must-see for fans of 
animatioA and sci-fi. 

By Charlie 

theaters this summer 

ore 
Starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Angela Bassett and Marlon 
Branda 
Plot: Career thief Nick Welles (De iro) has plans to retire and 
smle down. This is interrupted when his friend Max (Brando) 
arranges for him to work with a young thief ( orton) on a near-
ly impossible theft that will require the expertise of both Welles 
and the young ~cc.omplice. 
Outlook: The two best actors ever, De ira and Branda, join 
with Edward Norton to produce a gripping crime saga. The 
casting for this movie can't get any better than it does with these 
three actors. This 'action film is not just a standard blow-'em-up 
movie, but one that also includes fine acting and great suspense. 

• urasslc a III 
Starring Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, William H. MIUJI and Michael]eter 
Plot: Dr. Alan Grant (Neill) returns to the infamous Isla Soma 
when he is persuaded by a wealthy donor to give an aerial tour 
of the island inhabited by dinosaurs. Their plane crashes and 
the group becomes stranded on the island with carnivorous 
dinosaurs. It is now a struggle to escape the island as "survival 
of the fittest" reigns supreme. 
Outlook: Although "The Lost World" was a commercial suc-
cess, it was a rehash of the elements that made the original 
"Jurassic Park" unique and special. Unfortunately, this sequel 
fo llows "The Lost World" and is just another stol)' of a group of 
humans trapped on an island full of dinosaurs. Watching 
humans slaughtered by dinosaurs gets tiring and old after two 
movies. The addition of several new dinosaurs, including the 
flying Pteranodon, might make it interesting, but for a truly 
entertaining time. see the original. 

-merlc 
Starring Billy Crystal, john Cusack, julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-jones 
and Hank Azaria 

Plot: Hollywood's most popular cemple (Zeta-Jones 
and Cusack) have just broken up and their publicist 
(Crystal) is tl)'ing to make them look and act like a cou-
ple even though they hate each other. This charade 
becomes more difficult as Cusacks's character starts to fall 
in love with Zeta-Jones' assistant, played by Roberts. 
Outlook: Put Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts and John 
Cusack into a movie and what do you get? The perfect chick 
flick. Think "Notting Hill ," but this time Roberts plays the nor-
mal girl while Cusack is the major movie star. With a summer 
packed with action and suspense, this romance provides the 
perfect alternative for those tired of explosions and violence. 

Planet of he p s 
Starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter and 
Michael Clarke Duncan 
Plot: Astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crashes on a planet 
where primates rule and humans are their slaves. It is an upside-
down world where humans are brutally tormented by primates. 
The appearance of Davidson changes the status quo and he 
becomes the catalyst for a revolution against the primates. 
Outlook: If you are expecting a Charlton Heston-like "Damn 
dirty apes" line, then you should rent the original. Director Tim 
Burton (UBatman," "Sleepy Hollow") is remaking the original, 
but he also creates a vel)' different storyline. Burton remade Bat-
man into the dark figure that he is today and it should be a treat 
to see if this remake can pull off Burton's visionary magic and 
adapt it to the big screen. 

Rush Hour 
Starring Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker and Ziyi Zhang 
Plot: At the end of the first film , Detective James Carter (Tuck-
er) traveled back with his new-found partner, Detective Lee 
(Chan), to Hong Kong. This is another "fish out of water" stol)'-
line with Chris Thcker now playing the lost foreigner. They arc 
also on a case, taking them to 1,-os Angeles and Las Vegas. 
Outlook: The original movie was funny and it showed that 
Chan and Tucker had some chemistry betwcen them. In 
addition, "Rush Hour" provided an excellent opportunity 
to showcase Chan's stunts to the mainstream Ameri-
can audience. For those who can bear Tucker's 
obnoxious voice, this movie will easily be a 
crowd pleaser. Chan's stunts are still 
amazing to watch but he is getting older, 
so the stunts are not as intense or dra-
matic as they once were. 

Stal1711g Jason Biggs, han non Elizabcth, A[vson Hannigan, Chl7s 
Klein, atasha l:vonne, Tara Reid, Chris Owen and Mena 5uvari 

SPECIAL GRADUATION ISSUE 813 

Plot: The details of the stol)'line are being kept secret, so spec-
ulation on the stol)'line is abundant. Now that high school is 
finished. the gang is reunited as college students and continues 
on its sexual escapades. 
Outlook: The first movie was extremely funny and a surprise 
hit, but the sequel will probably not equal the first. The film will 
still induce cringes and shock with its crude humor, bllt gross-
out comedies are now more prevalent, making the sequel seem 
less original. However, expect to laugh again with more adven-
tures with baked goods and band camp. 

Cap a-n ore Ii" 
andolin 

Stam'ng Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz, john Hurt and Christian Bale. 
Plol: Set along the Grecian coast during World War 11, Captain 
Antonio Corelli (Cage) is a man who manages to alienate an 
entire village. One of the villagers, Pelagia (Cruz), slowly suc-
cumbs to the charm of Corelli and after her fiance leaves, the rela-
tionship between Corelli and Pelagia grows. As the war continues 
to magnify, it tests the strength of their love in desperate times. 
Outlook: Director John Madden ("Shakespeare in Love") has 

shown that he is capable of directing 
a love story with panache. 

This looks like the case 
with this film as Mad-
den is aided with the 
acting of Cage and 
Cruz. This film looks 
to be a pleasant and 
subtle surprise from 
all the fanfare sur-
rounding the other 
films.
