by J eff Tidus 

Chancellor Says TT Editor 
Firing Is 'Probably Illegal' 

The Academic Senate (AS) Tuesday approved significant changes in the 
General Education requirements of Revelle and Third Colleges . Both propo ed 
sets of changes were approved by a strong majority of the faculty -administration 
group. 

Most of the chan~es for both colle~es involve elimination of equence 
requirements , replaCing them with reqwrements of a comparable number of 
courses taken from different departments.

The firing of David Buch-

binder as editor-in-chief of 
the Triton Times was 
" probably illegal/" 
Chancellor McElroy told the 
UCS D Academic Senate 
(AS) Tuesday. 

Revelle (hages 
The Revelle Humanities requirement has been modified to allow students 

to take approved lower division courses fr~m three contribution depart-
ments : History, Literature , and Philosophy . New courses for thIS ca ta gory 
will be selected on the basis of their broadness and the proficien cy in writing 
that the class would require . 

Also , five Humanities courses w ill be required rather than six, allow Ing a 
student to take one more Fine Arts course . 

"The procedure that was ' 
used was not the correct 
procedure. I don/t think it's 
legal to remove an editor/" 

The Social Science requirement may now be satisifed in three different 
departments rather than only by a sequence . According to Hazel Alksnis in 
the Revelle provost's office , " The (Revelle) faculty disapproved of thiS 
change, but bowed to student pressure ." 

The foreign language proficiency requirement can now be satisfied In 
Greek or Latin . Also, the completion of courses 1-6 In a foreign language w ill 
satisfyu the requirement . 

he commented, adding that 
legal shadings are now 
being pondered by legal 
counsel to the university . 

The Chancellor made no 
mention of a possible 
reversal of the decision he 
made three weeks ago to 
fire Buchbinder for con-
sistent insensitivity toward 
"people of color" at UCSD. 
The Triton Times dispute 
resulted from complaints 
concerning an April Fools 
edition of the newspaper. 

McElroy also told the AS 
that he had " reluctantly" 
acc pted the UCSD 
Communications Board'~ 
recom mendation that 
Buchbinder be dismissed. 
Comm Board chairman 
Michael Weiss, who also 

William McElroy' 
addressed the group, said three weeks ago, in which 
that the Chancellor "was his decisions were con-
not reluctant at all," adding tained, said he made the 
that the committee's major choice to fire Buchbinder 
recommendation was that "with regret ." He did not at

minors will remain unchanged , but Hazel Alksnis that " only a good project 
minor will be accepted ; not some of the vague affiliations which have been 
recently approved ." In addition , a third way to complete the minor w ill be 
offered . Any six courses, a m inimum of three be 'ng upper divis ion, which are 
non-contiguous to the major , will sa tisfy the minor, eg a Science major can 
take any six courses in the Humanities or Social Science departments to 
complete the requirement. 

Third (hanges 
The new Third College GE requirements give students a chOice of a 

program A or a program B. Required in each are one quarter of composition 
one quarter of mathemat ics, and three quarters in Natural SCience 

The first program requires no sequences , but requires three course each In 
Third World Studies and Urban and Rural Studies . Two quarters are reqUired 
in Communications . . 

Program B requires a three quarter sequence, with one course each In 
Communications, Third World Studies , and Urban a!1d Rural Studies, along 
with a three quarter sequence in any Humanit ies or Social SCience diSCipline 

Both new Third programs list minors as optiona l.

Questions following Constitution Is 'Only Protection' 
Housing Wailing Lists 

by Robert .. Rehm 

Because of an unusually 
large demand for on -
campus housing next year 
by returning students, the 
ratio of freshmen to 
retu rnees may not be as 
high as expected . 

It was reported in 'the 
Triton Times April 23 that 
many spaces originally 
reserved for return i ng 
students would be turned 
over to freshmen next year ; 
but according to Bernard 
51 0 , Vice Chancellor for 
Administration, this is not 
true. Apparently the 
confusion r ulted when

one of the resident deans 
gave a T.T . reporter this 
information before the final 
decision had been made. 

In mid-May, after in-
coming freshmen have filed 
their requests for on-
campus housing, Sisco's 
office will "re-assess the 
situation" and try to 
determine final priorities 
for housing. 

One hundred housing 
spaces are being held in 
reserve for hardship cases 
by the Provosts of Muir and 
Revelle until late summer. 
" In all probability these will 
go to returning students'," 
said Sisco, W~dnesday . If 
this occurs, it will lower the 
traditional ratio of fresh-
men to returnees from 
60 :40 to 55 :45 . 

Arrangements are now 
being made with the La 
Jolla Village Apartments to 
house as many students as 
pos ible there next year. 
New units of the apart-
ments are scheduled to 
open in September, 
creating paces for 528 
students . 

The university plans to 
make arrangements with 
the San Diego Transit 
System for bus service 
between the campus and 
the apartments. A resident 
dean's program may also be 
instituted if deemed 
necessary by the ad-
ministration .

McElroy' s and Weiss ' 
statements from members 
of the AS seemed for the 
most part to oppose the 
firing of Buchbinder . At one 
point, when Weiss was 
asked if freedom of the 
press was considered to be 
an issue, he responded, 
"The board feels this is not 
an issue at all."

I AS Tables GP Motion I 
by Paul Osterman III 

A new grading system, proposed by the Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP), was denied approval by the 
Academic Senate (AS) last Tuesday 

However, the Senate told the CEP to resubmit its 
proposal after appropriate faculty and student con-
sultation . 

The new proposal by CEP, if approved by the enate 
in its present form would allow the grades A, B, ,and 0 
to be uffixed by a plus (+) and minus (-) . Each uffix 
would also carry a .33 grade point per unit. 

Under this new system, a C- whi h now arries 2.0 
GPU, would only carry 1.67 GPU and a B+ which now 
carries 3.0 GPU would carry 3.33 GPU . 

A grade of A+ will only carry 4.0 GPU under the 
system, but according to the CEP propo al an A+ will 
repre ent "extraordinary achievement." 

Chemistry Profe~sor Jame!> Arnold , speaking at the AS 
meting Monday, said, " It ~ill ave wear and tear on th 
students, and they could have an A- instead of a B." 

Dr . Patrick Ledden, Math professor and acting 
Provost of Fourth College is opposed to the feature . 
Addressing the meeting, he said, "It will simply increase 
the lines that must be drawn, and put a rise in the 
number of disputed grades." 

The CEP proposal also contains an 'In progress' grade. 
Accordina to Professor Newmark, CEP Chairman, the IP 
grade allows flexibility for courses that may extend over 
the length of one quarter. 

Senate Chairman Herbert Stern told the Triton Times, 
"The proposal will now go back to the CEP to work out

Democrats Abound 
The latest figures from the Secretary of State's office 

shows that Democrats have taken a commanding lead 
in voter registration figures in California. If party 
preferences were the only factors deciding the up-
coming election in each of California:s 163 legislative 
districts, Democrats would win 141 of the seats. 

Democrats now comprise 55.5% of the electorate 
while Republicans only hold the allegiance of 37% of 
the voters. The rest of the voters are primarily "In-
dependents" with a smattering of Peace and Freedom, 
American Independent, and other minor parties . 

The new figures from the Secretary of State's office 
show that of the 15 districts in San Diego California 
(seven assembly, four senatorial , and four U .S. 
congressional) nine have democratic majorities . This 
preference is even more sharply defined when one notes 
that in the six districts which Republicans hold a 
majority, five are partially or almost completely in the 
Republican strongholds of Orange Imperial Counties. 
Only one Republican distrct is completely in San 
Diego, and it is centered in the traditionally con-
servative North County (the 76th Assembly) . 

, 

The most dramatic change in San Diego County is in 
the 78th Assembly District now represented by 
Democrat Larry Kapiloff . In 1972 Kapiloff pulled off the 
upset of the year in California when he defeated E. 
Richard Barnes're-election attempt. The 78th, centered 
around Point Lorna and Ocean Beach, had long been 
considered the centre of Republican strength in the city 
of San Diego . Barnes had routinely defeated 
Dem ocrat.ic challengers for 10 years . Kapiloff ran a 
issue related campaign and benefited from Barnes, a 
retired Navy Chaplain, inability to wage an energetic 
one. 

Today the 78th Assembly District apparently has 
become a Democratic stronghold. 49.1 % of the voters 
are Democratic while only 41 .3% are Republicans. Part 
of the change can be explained by the recent tran-
sformation of the Beach Areas. In the past Ocean 
Beach, Mission Beach, and Pacific Beach were heavily 
conservative. The recent influx of younger people, who 
tend to be more liberal, has made Kapiloff a virtual 
shoo-in . Additionally, Kapiloff has been an active 
member of the Assembly and has been able to retain a 
great deal of contact with the voters. This year, Linda 
Vista was added to his district while conservative 
Coronado was given to the South Bay district. 

Districts that could change hands this year are the 
75th Assembly (represented by Ray Seely R-Blythe); 
77th Assembly (now held by Bob Wilson, D-La Mesa) 
and the 41~t Congressional (under Bob Wilson R-San 
Diego) . These three districts could be the area where 
toe major parties make their etfort to hold their group or 
to pick up an extra seat. 

Political Notes Jerome Waldie, candidate for 
governor was in San Diego Monday to continue his 
"Walk" which he hopes will gain him support in his race 
against frontrunners Brown, Alioto, and Moretti. Waldie 
said he expects to win tHe June primary through a 
combination of low voter turnout, his organization, and 
a large number candidates (there are now 18 Democrats 
running) . Waldie, who is a major member of the " Im-
peach Nixon" movement in Congress, called the 
acquittal of Maurice Stans and John -Mitchell in 
Vesco case "a plus for the President ." ... Lt. Gov. Ed 
Reinecke said Monday that if his perjury trial were held 
after the June primary. it would be "asking an awful lot" 
of Republicans to nominate him for Governor . Reinecke 
believes that about half of the now 47% undecided 
Republicans would have to vote for him. He now leads 
State Controller Houston Flournoy if]. the California 
Field Poll 28% to 24%.

problems, and it will be resubmitted in June. It is also 
understood that during the interim period. the CEP will 
seek appropriate consultation with the students." When 
asked about the possibility of an open meeting between 
faculty, students and the CEP, Stern said, "an open 
meeting is entirely up to the CEP." 

The proposal, whatever its content, if passed at the 
June Academic Senate meeting will most likely be 
implemented for the ne)(t school year . The proposal , 
however, according to Stern must then go through the 
University Wide Committee on Educational PoliCY, and 
then to the State Wide U.c. Academic Senate for Final 
approval. 

Writing Tutors Needed 
Helping freshmen to 

write better papers, gaining 
experience teaching and 
enjoying work with people 
are three of the benefits of 
tutori ng in Lit/E ng 10-
Composition. There are 
about 25 openings for good 
writers to tutor in Fall 1974. 
To qualify students must 
have 84 units by September. 
a 3.0 CPA, and must submit 
a sample of their writing. 

First quarter tutors take 
Lit/ Cen 194, The Teaching 
of Writing while they are 
tutoring and receive 4 units 
credit . They usually spend a 
total of 10 to 12 hours a 
week tutoring and in the 
training course I n sub-
seque nt quarters tutors 
receive either 4 additional 
units of credit (Lit/Gen 195)

to allow students flexibility in planning vacations. 

Some of the summer classes themselves include 
vacation trips - ecology of the California Channel 
Islands, geology of the High Sierras, a raft trip through 
the gorges of the Colorado River, and study tours to East 
Africa, countries in Europe, and the Midriff Islands in 
the Sea of Cortez . 'Subjects' on these long-distance 
tours include marine life, zoology, education, and the 
humanities. -

Housing 
Continued from Page 1 

Mary Pates. Revelle 
Resident Dean, said 
Monday that demand for 
housing by returning 
students has never been 
higher than this year . She 
attributes the trend to 
inflation and a change in 
attitude on the part of 
students. "Students are 
different than they were 
four years ago. They're 
more goal-oriented and 
more satisfied with school. 
Students change all the 
time," Pates said . She 
added that they're even 
more satisfied with the food 
~,ervice now than in the 
past. 

A total of 2112 students 
wi II be housed on campus 
next year, 855 of the spaces 
will go to returning students 
1157 to incoming freshmen 
and advanced standing 
students under 19 years of 
age; and 100 spaces will be 
reserved for assignment at 
the discretion of the Muir 

and Revelle provosts to 
hardship cases. 

Because of the opening 
of Fourth College next year. 
many students will again be 
living at a co llege other 
than the one they attend. 
Muir will house 80 Revelle 
freshmen. 470 Muir FreshÂ· 
men , 339 Muir returnees 
and will hold 50 spaces 
open until late summer. 

Revelle will house 144 
Fourth College freshmen, 
332 Revelle freshmen, 351 
returning Revelle students 
and the provost will assign 
50 spaces at a later date . 

Demand for housing at 
Third College and spaces 
available "matched", said 
Sisco. 54 Muir and Revelle 
students, assigned to live at 
Third this year chose to 
enter room draw there and 
wi II also reside at Third next

Classics in Review 
After a pause since October, the La Jolla Chamber 

Orchestra resumed its concert fare with Lawrence Smith 
as guest conductor and Misha Dichter as piano soloist. 
It was good to hear the orchestra perform again; they 
presented a varied program that provided for some good 
music and hopefully some fun . 

The concert opened with J.S. Bach's (1685-1750) 
"Third Brandenberg Concerto" . This is music that 
pleased easily; their combination of inventiveness. 
melody, and bt!auty manifest them as one of the 
supreme works of art in Western Civilization . When 
performing works of the baroque, the ever important 
questions of style and interpretation assume special 
importance. We have, of course, no recordings of how 
Bach performed the music, but we have certain hun-
ches. Many composers lett frequently conflicting 
treatises on how a passage was to be "properly" played. 
Like anything else, these must always be regarded in 
light of the person speaking, the country (Italian in-
terpretation could hardly be more different than French 
or German baroque), arid the period : then as now styles 
changed. Still we know much of how music of the time 
was not played; unfortunately, in many cases this in-
cludes how it was written. like most young. 
knowledgeable conductors, Mr. Smith presented an 
intelligent performance that didn't break any of the big 
rules and followed most of the little ones . He for-
tunately used only nine strings (three each of violins, 
violas and cellos) besides the continuo. as indicated in 
the score. This allowed the complex structure and 
counterpoint of the piece to emerge. Similarly, he didn't 
play the somewhat mystical Adagio as two gloriOUS 
chords. something unquestionably wrong. but em-
bellished them on the harpsichord. So except for a few 
ragged spots (one on a part, remember) and some 
nervouS conducting from the keyboard, the per-
forma nce was rather vigorous, tastefully done. and 
quite enjoyable. 

Mr Dichter joined th~ orchestra in Mozart's " Piano 
Concerto number 23 in A major." K.488. The orchestra 
was in superb form; I've never heard them play better. 
Misha Dichter. on the otherhand, presented a per-
formance that left me unexcited . While technically 
quite good, the performance lacked a certain coherency 
and total conception that preyented its sparkling. 

After intermission . the orchestra played Richard 
Wagner's (1813-1883) Sigfried Ldyll. Wagner's first wife 
had been childless. and therefore so had been Richard

,on!) USing themes mo tly from this opera, he com-
posed the Siegfried Idyll , and presented it to Cosima on 
Christmas Morning, 1870, th ir first Christmas together 
as man and wife It is cored for sixteen In truments , 
some may argue that this was simp ly because it was first 
performed on the tairs of Wagner's villa at Triebschen, 
and, owning neither a hotel or eight story house. he 
could not score it for an entire orchestra . Perhaps. but it 
becomes an extremely effective chamber work in thi 
scoring. and I would have liked to have seen it so 
performed. The orchestra 's playing was good. but I 
would have liked a little more romilntrcism and mood-
setting. 

The concert closed with Alberto Cinastera's (1910- ) 
"Varra iones Concertantes." a set of eleven variations 
each featUring a djfferent solo In trument of in-

~truments . It is a very difficult piece, and illustrated the 
great d pth and talent in our' orchestra A flashy piece 
like this ca nnot be prayed by less than professional 
musiC ians. rhe audience was impressed by the exciting 
but rarely heard piece, the sup rb performance, and the

ROAD FOOD - The Cuess 
Who, RCA Records 

with the whole pop-star 
blues problem) With " Road 
rood". the tOpi IS agarn 
dealt with, but In a much 
wishy-washier way 

Talk about 
schizophrenia! The 
distinction between " pop" 
a nd " progressive" rock 
these days has become so 
delineated that there's a~ 
aura of either FM or AM 
surrounding just about 
every group these days And 
for those undecided about 
Nhich side of the fence they 
belong on. that walk on the 
borderl i ne ca n be 
dangerous. 

one the less, the first 
side of the album IS an 
interesting musical time 
trip . starting off with a 
tongue in cheek late 6O's 
sound on " StarBaby", 
diPPing way back to 40's for 
some great vocal harmonies 
and arran gem nts In 
" Straighten Out", stepping 
up to 50's With a superior 
retake of "Don't You Want 
Me" where the addition of a 

I trio of saxophones spices up 

That seems to me the 
problem with t~e Cuess 
Who's latest effort. They 
know their public image 
runs AM (on their age old 
pop efforts " Undun" " These 
Eyes" " Laughin". " American 
Woman" and so on and 
on ... ) but they seem to 
strive 'to get beyond that (as 
was demonstrated on their 
last LP " No.l0", which 
thematically sort of dealt 

â¢ the compOSition, and then 
jolts back to 70's with a few 
discords and distorted 
guitar riffs rnto "One Way 
Road to Hell" . 

Unfortunately, the album 
falls down on side two. with 
some weaker material . and 
the big-sell out number 
"Clap For The Wolfman" on 

Theatre: Larry Deckel 

Bimbo's Cosr'lic Circus 
There was a time when the American 

dream had something to do with growing 
up to be President. an ideal which in 
these times seems far less ideal. Among 
the displacement fantasies which grew in 
the 60's cu lture was the so-called " Rock 
Star Fantasy" in which every young man 
wanted to be a rock 'n'roll star. and 
electric guitar sales blossomed (as did 
the hair. cloth ing, and drug images which 
accompanied it all) . 

This particuliar fantasy then becomes 
the main-stay or jumping off point for 
Bimbo's Cosmic Circus. the current " rock 
musical" now at the Off Broadway 
Theatre Herein , a ci rcus clown by name 
of Bimbo, leaves the circus to become a 
rock 'nÂ° roll clown (an interesting reversal 
of the old chestnut about boys running 
off to join the circus). and meets with all 
the disillusionments in the hard hard 
world. 

Kenny Ortega co-authors the script 
with John Flynn. and stars in the leading 
role as Bimbo. along with a cast of ex-
Hair cast members from its infinite road 
companies, and succeeds in creating the 
most disgraceful sham of theatre and/ or 
music that has reach the San Diego stage 
to date . 

The play is no more than one em-
barassment after another as it trys to 
reach its "cosmic" highs. popping hip 
talk and the word "shit" every five 
minutes. The music backs up this 
pretensiousness with about the most 
forgettable score of all time which 
traverse s blandness only when it 
blatantly steals from established rock 
styl s. 

the vocal projection does not even 
pel I'lrate into the first few rows of the 
the I(re . This breed of vocal requires a 
fin ,y adaptable falsetto which was 
lacking in the group as a whole. and 
Joplin and J. C. Superstar vocal imitations 
seemed to be the order of the evening. 

I t 's hard to say what to lay the biggest 
blame on The acting was so represen -
tational as to resemble a Junior High 
Pageant, the directing so lacking that the 
transitional moments seemed to be " time 
outS". the set in gaudy taste not to be 
believed. the band yawning, the pacing 
so off that Mack Trucks could have been 
driven through the holes between lines .. 

Kudos must be given to Hillary Carlip 
for the evenings only redeeming moment 
in which she presented an incredible 
di play of juggling ski ll as an in-
termission, out-of-text schtick; but an 
evening in which the central prop in 
" rock heaven" IS a two foot stuffed black 
plastic penis which Bimbo gets to wear 
and thus b~come a truly great rock star. 
has just got to be an rnsult to anyone's 
credibilities . 

I credit the Off-Broadway with good 
intentions for trying to find en-
tertainment with a different appeal and a 
change of pace from situation comedies. 
but good intentions don't always make 
good theatre and Bimbo's Cosmic Circus 
is nothing other than a cosmic atrocity It 
is a distortion of what good theatre 
should be. and a brutal misrepresen-
tation of what rock music is about. It 
introduces into theatre a pretensious 
display of with-it-ness. loppy produc-
tion . and what one audience member 
ca lled " a whole new type ot pain ."

No matter whi,lt your 
party affiliation or opinion 
of the state of California 
you can take an interest In 
this )un 's primary ballot In 
addition to including the 
primary races for partisan 
offices there are nine 
Important propositions 

The Issues run the gamut 
from bond acts for parks, 
water quality and Cal ifornla 
Veteran ' s aid to com-
prehensive governmental 
reform I f one IS concern d 
with ('ven one of these 
Issues he must be regl t red 
to vote by Ma y 5. 

Propositions 1, 2 and 5 all 
relate to environmental 
Issues The first allows 250 
million dollars In bonds to 
be sold for the use of the 
State Park Sy tem . 
Proposition 2 also allows for 
bonds to be sold to con-
tinup th wastewater 
treatment program started 
In 1970 The proposition's 
goal IS to substantially 
reduce the amount of 
untreated sewage In 
California 's waterways, a 
program well under way but 

affecting only 40 per cent of 
the state 's wat rs . 
Propositton 2 would extend 
treatment to 90 percent of 
Ca l ifornia's waters. 

Propo ition 5 allows for 
motor vehicle fuel taxes 
and license fees to be 
released for area by area 
u age The fees are ex-
tended to Include funding 
of research, planning and 
construction of mass 
transit. This proposition 
frees large urban areas to 
decide the fate of mass 
transit in their community, 
wher a rural areas still 
have the option to improve 
and enlarge their road 
network . 

There is much discontent 
over California Veteran's 
programs Many states help 
their veterans with aid in 
addition to that received on 
the Federal level California 
has only minor program 
along this line. Proposition 
3 would establi h a bond 
issue for 350 million dollar 
to provide farm and home 
loans for California 
veterans 

Propositions 6 and 
would make California ~tat

only by a concu rrent 
resolution or t hrough

Proposition 9, the on ly 
initiative on june's ballot , IS 
by far the most comp lex 
and ontroversial It 
provides for limitation on 
expenditures for statpwide 
offices, reporting of 
receipts and expenditures 
and prohibltlnll offi ial 
from deciding Issues relat d 
to their " fi nan cia l i n-

Open Letter 
On rriday, April 5th, the UCSD Women's Center 

offiCially opened 10 the space previously ca llE'd the 
Iishbowl, located 10 the lower MUir Commons. At that 
time, several questions were raised as to t he nature of 
the Women 's Center. We would like to take the op-
portunity to answer those question s at this time in the 
follOWing summary of the Women's Center. 

We, of the Women 's Center, feel there exist unique 
problems that women face as a result of changes 
concerni ng women in the political. ocial and economic 
situations 10 this society, and also as a result of their 
own changtng attitude , roles and li festyles. We feel the 
need for a central location to focus and tie together the 
diverse energies given off by and directed for women in 
general, and particularly women connected wjth this 
University; thus, the purpose of the UCSD Women's 
Center. Due to limiting factors that every group en-
cou nters, and due to our need to take one step at a time, 
the concern of women was given our first priority, rather 
than people in general. W e also believe, though , that 
one positive change in society will affect all other 
resulting changes, and thus hopefully one day there will 
be no need for a specifically " Women's" Center. 
Meanwhile, we will keep working . 

The Women's Center is here to serve the needs of all 
UCSD students, faculty and staff, of both sexes We 
invite all men as well as women to the activities and 
programs we have availab le. At the present or in the 
immediate future, we are offeri ng Lifestyle Planning 
workshops, Assertion Training, referral s for course 
projects concernin g women, Library, Medical, Legal and 
Educational resour ce information, Consciousne ss-
Raising groups, our Women's Month of various ac-
tivities sc hedules this month , as well as work on an in-
depth questionnaire survey of the specia l needs of 
UCSD women and the services those needs may require 
future plans include Child Care referral, Car r 
Planning, workshops on various topics, further work on 
gathering information for a medical survey of the San 
Diego area, and the _development of Women Studies 
courses. 

The Wom en's Center is "peopled" (a opposed to 
" manned") by ,a group of dedicated students and staff 
who answer the phone (453-2000, ext. 1030), make 
referrals, take suggestion s, and generciTly help out 
however they an , to erve the general need concerning 
women that persons who come to the Center, might 
have. If these staff people do not have the information 
n eded, they will try to refer the person to som one 
who does. The Women's Center is "open" Monday 
through rriday from lOAM to 3PM (and possibly one 
night a week) . Feel free to come in, ask questions, 
browse through our Women's book co llection, make 
suggestions, and in general find out what 's gOing on In 
the Women's Center We welcome new ideas and new

article of " The Top Ten

which appeared in the April

position of minoritie 10

been closer to 1 umwater). 
It i truly outrageous that 
the TT seeks to perpetuate 
Guch beliefs under the guise

continUing battle against th e 
government and the administratIOn 
to offer quality education. 

In ~ tead of demandin g the 
needed In crease in faculty 
positions which could be easi ly 
filled due to the tremendous 
surplus of PhD's the fa culty has , 
given the powers that be the 
tremendous rationalization of 
increasing the free scab labor of 
seniors thus eroding the su pport 
gradua te students need, and 
depri vi ng unemployed professors 
of jobs that should exist. 

The first time a person teaches, 
he invariably performs worst. A 
graduate student always improves 
as he teac hes more and more . By 
continua lly having seniors teach, 
With at least one year less maturity, 
the undergraduates continually get 
Inexperienced section leaders . The 
senior gets cheated out of a course 
he should be taking. Grar.ted, he 
learns a lot from teaching, but he is 
re-learn i ng freshman material and 
not being exposed to advanced 
topics in his major, as he should be. 
In addi tion, he is unqualified, 
being merely a senior, while 
gradual e students wbo are T A's are 
generally the students the 
departments ex pect the most of, 
and have carefully screened before 
being accepted and offered an 
ass l tantship

Insensitivity, and racism on

C dn you tell me what's 
funny about the Kent State 
murders of 19701 Why 
doesn't the TT do a satire on 
how the head of the 

dtional Guard and the 
head of the RiJle 
Ass ocia tion along with 
members of the MortiCians 
Union having been named 
to key position at th 
college .. . Don' t you think 
that's funny and shows

Or closer to home, why 

doesn't the I T do another 
of Its funny satires about 
how the chancellor " 
brother was named by the 
A LU as Buchbinder 's 
lawyer, and members of the 

ommunications Iloard 
were selec t d dS hi s jury. 
The headline could read 
" BUCHBINDER GUARAN-
TEED rAIR AND SPEEDY 
TRIAL" with a ki cker that 
said "One Out of Two Isn' t 
Bad". .. Hi lawyer could be 
quoted as saying, " I 
discussed the case with my 
brother and we think that 
justice will be ser-
ved"!Don't you think that 
an article like that would be 
in good taste, funny and 
timely by the TT's apparent 
sta ndard s? And surely 
David Buchbinder with his 
wonderful sense of humor 
and judgment would have 
no objections! 

If you've ever had a class 
in 201 or 506 MC or had to 
walk from Revelle to Third 
to Muir and back to Third 
for classes while officials 
were B.S.ing around with 
your perm anent stru c-
tures .. Or if vou've ever <;at 
in Munsinger's psych class 
while white thrived on his 
propoganda ... Or read the 
TT where one week whites 
are bad-mouthing Blacks 
about " Lady Sings the 
Blues" , the next week 
there's an unsubstantiated 
letter from a Black woman 
that impotent whites are 
getting a charge out of , and 
till another we k th ere's 

the Fool ' s Issue, you 
wouldn't se the humor in 
those sati res, either . The 
who I point is that the 
situation at Third (like Kent 
State and Buchbinder 's 
position) IS definitely not 
fu nny and IS nothing to joke 
about To do 0, and then 
fault people who see no 
humor In It as over-
sensi tive. is cra ss and 
unfalr l 

David Buchbinder wasn't 
disml sed 01 y as a result 
of the r ool 's issue- that

Editor: 
To those in charge of 

soliciting speakers for our 
campus; recently, Governor 
Reagan spoke at UC Davis. 
At UCLA, two se r i ou s 
ca ndidates for the 
Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination had a debate. 

IlIlot Richardson spoke at 
<;outhwestern College, a 
nearby community college 

Hov ' ver, here at UCSD, 
our speakers are almost 
always very little renowned, 
or renowned Within their 
specifi c a ademlc field , but 
not with the publi c In 
gen ral Often they are far 
left or are promoting 
som ('thing like tran-
scendental meditation .. A 
typical example IS one of 
our recent speakers, Dan 
Sytron, a SOCia list cand idate 
for the U S Senate, who 
doesn't have a snowball 's 
chance in hell of winning 
that election 

I thIOk that an improved 
effort should be made to 
bring speakers here who are 
more well known by the 
general public and whose 
visits would generate in-
terest among the student 

Labor and the Chancellor 
Editor : 
Last week the Chancellor nearly had a picket line 

from six loca l unions at his UCSD Luau at Sea World . 
The choi ce of th is establi shment for this occasion was 
unfortunate. It is one of the most anti-union businesses 
in this city and its work force suffers low wages, no 
securi ty and few, and in most cases no, benefits. Sea 
World is on the "do not patronize" lists of both the 
California Federatipn of Labor and the San Diego-
I mperial Count ies Labor Council . 

An exchange of letters between Dr. McElroy and R R 
Richardson, Secretary-Treasu rer of the labor council , 
began what we hope is gOll1g to be a continull1g dia log 
betw en thi s university and its tax-paying community of 
working people . The Chancellor's part of this xchange 
was bfief and ambiguous stating that he would take the 
labor cou nci l's views Into account 10 the future in 
regards to universi ty-sponsored events . But the in-
formational picket line 'was called off as a sign of good 
fa ith in the expectation that he meant the university will 
not patronize businesses when It is known that here is a 
labor dispute. 

The issues of labor have been traditionally ignored by 
the university community unless something actually 
happens on campus. The research resources of higher 
education generally cater to corporat ions and their 
foundations or government funded commissions and 
studies whi ch take the pose of " objectivity" . Rarely does 
the university find itself specifically in support of the 
overwhelming majority of wage earners. Th is issue 
becomes criti ca l wh en there is a labor-busi ness dispute 
because there IS no middle ground To patronize 
businesses hurts unions, to boycott businesses hurts 
businesses. 

As a part of the labor movement, which is one of the 
few means truly capabl e of protecting and expanding 
the rights and needs of working people in the face of 
corporate conglomerates and monolithi c government, 
our AFT loca l intends to press the universi ty to support 
ItS working community. We are now se tt ing up a 
committee to research the relations between university 
and labor and invite any staff member, student or 
faculty interested to contact my elf. We commend the 
Chancellor for his desire to take the views of labor into 
consideration . This committee will seek to represent to 
the Chancellor and the universi ty community the views 
of labor in relation to speci fic university activities.

Freer Shines, But. .. 
Netters Fall 

A close tennis match was 
played between UCSD and 
CSU rullerton Tuesday 
afternoon . Fullerton inched 
ahead to a score of 6-4. 

The most spectacular 
victory for UCSD was taken 
by Richard Freer . lJsually 
ranked #7 on the ladder, 
Freer played the first singles 
for the Tritons, winning 
with a score of 6-4, 2-6, 7-6. 
He played a terrific game. 
using his ground strokes 
and passing shots to his 
advilntage. 

Angel Lopez confidently 
won his match in the fifth 
singles, 6-4, 6-2. Very rarely 
miSSing a shot, Angel was 
continually on top of ' his 
opponent. Skip Schink 's 
easy victory in the #6 slot 
shows that his skills are 
misplaced 50 low on the 
team 's ladder. The pace was 
set for his si ngles match 
when Skip broke a tring on 
his first serve; his game was 
powerful throughout the 
competition , bringing him a 
score of 6-1. 6-3. 

The Tritons made 
Fullerton work for the 2m1. 

3rd, 4th and 7th singles with 
close scores : 
Kurt Fristrup 
Nick White 
Jack Tawfik 
Shack Fisher 

6-3,7-6 
6-1 , 7-5 
6-3,6-4 
7-6,6-4 

Despite good playing' on 
the part of the Tritons, 
Fullerton claimed two of 
the doubles matches. Skip 
Schink exercised his fierce 
serves, and Shack took care 
of most of the close hard 
shots. The final score was 6-
3,6-4, Fullerton . Playing 3rd 
doubles, Tony Lopez and 
Jack Tawfik were up against 
rough competition : 6-4, 6-2. 

Bill Duke and Angel 
Lopez provided an exciting 
2nd doubles match . 
featuring heated volleys 
that kept their opponents 
runn i ng aH over the court. 
Bill and Angel' took this 
victory 6-4, 7-6. 

Today the tennis team 
will challenge Point Loma 
at 2:00. This is your last 
chance to watch a home 
match . an afternoon of 
talented Triton tenn is. 

Tritons Stop USIU: 
Play AP for Title 

The UCSD Baseball squad 
inched closer to a possible 
league championship last 
Tuesday as they disposed of 
c ross town rival USIU 
handily. 7-2. The Tritons 
now stand in second place 
of the NAIA District III 
Southern League with a fine 
12-5 record . 

Saturday the team travels 
to Azusa Pacific for a

by Mark Liska 

ED NOTE! Maddog Mary Zimmerman has been 
making football headlines for a long time, first on the 
collegiate scene and now on the professional level She 
was an All-American Heisman Trophy Winner at the 
University of Southern California campus . Her defensive 
play led USC to the #4 ranking in the country and 
number one defensively. She was drafted on the first 
round by the Rams and has earned a starting position 
after her first two games during the exhibition . 

MMZ: Football helps, it means I don't have no 
aggressions you know? and I don't have this urge to 
punch people like I had when I was a little girl, before I 
played football at all. It was a desperate situation since I 
had to beat up all the boys on the block . 

UT: I'll bet you were good at it too! 

MMZ: Darn right! What, are you trying to get funny? 

UT: What about your husband, does he mind you 

Maddog has kindly consented to al low some in-
terview time to Untitled Staff Reporter Chet Chebunski 
despite a very busy schedule . 

playing professional football? What kind of life does he 
lead? 

UT: Maddog, where did you earn the name of 
Maddog anyway, Ms . Zimmerman? 

MMZ: He don't mind, we both have the money. My 
playing professional football doesn't have any other 
effect, Cecil has a good time working in the hospital as a 
volunteer and takin~ care of the kids . 

MMZ: I eat quarterbacks, like a rabid dog. UT : Well that 's about it, thank's a lot Maddog. 

UT: Do you find any difficulties or differences in 
playing professional vs . college football? Have you had 
any adjustment problems? 

MMZ: The players are bigger, quicker. stronger, but 
they're still men, inferior, and I sti ll eat 'em up. 

UT: I n college you were one of the biggest players on 
most any field - at 6'5", 260 pou.nds not a whole lot of 
offensive guards pushed you around. Is this any dif-
ferent on the profeSSional level? 

KSDT, KPRI Meet 
In Softball Game 

MMZ: Naw, the guys are bigger but they're still 
wimps, nobody pushes Maddog Mary around . Besides. 
they're afraid of me since I got the name Maddog. -

UT: You're the third girl to make a profess-

MMZ' Woman, not girl chucko, and don't you forget 
it either or you'lI think you're a quarterback! 

UT: Excuse, you 're the third woman to make a 
professional football team - do you think this trend wi II 
continue? Do you think you're starting a precedent? 

MMZ: I'd have to say that this is certainly a major 
breakthrough . Cindy for the Bombers and Kate for the 
Tigers are just on the taxi squad. I'm the first one to 
make a starti ng lineup. 

As for the precedent setti ng effect - I would say there 
are 30-40 women in the college ranks that will make 
great profeSSional prospects . There's this one cute 
fullback playing in San Diego, Bertha - the Bomb r -
Breakbone who's just fantasti c. 

UT Ms Zimmerman , has your playing of professional 
footbal l, or any football . affected your private life? 

MMZ: It certainly has. I make quite a bit of money 
playing football. 

UT: I was thinking more along the lines of your 
private life with your husband ?

Superhard Material 
LOS ANGELES-A new material second in hardness 

only to diamond and produced relatively easi II and 
cheaply, has been developed by a UCLA engineering 
professor. 

The superhard material is made of titanium carbide, 
formed in thin layers through a physical vapor 
deposition process, and is the invention of Professor 
Rointan F. Bunshah of the UCLA materials department. 

Described by one of his colleagues as " easily the most 
startling material development in recent years," 
titanium carbide promises to have a wide range of uses 
in cutting. grinding and wearing resistant applicatio~s. 

"Some of its ol:.vious use~ ," says Dr . Bunshah , "are in 
cutting too ls, machine tools, oil drills, turbine blades, 
jet engines, and food and textile machines, and possibly 
in catalysts for energy devices and automobiles ." 

I n the coating of rotary cutting tools alone, users may 
be able to realize total savings in the millions if the 
drills' effectiveness is increased by only 10 percent. 

The UCLA Professor believes that titanium carbide 
call produced at one-hundredth to one-thousandth the 
cost of various commerdal grades of synthetic 
diamonds. 

The basis of Dr. Bunshah 's physical vapor 
deposition process lies in vaporizing titanium metal 
atoms, through electric beam heating, in a vacuum 
chamber, where they react with a hydrocarbon gas to 
form titanium carbide. 

The newly-formed compound, produced in the vapor 
phase, is then condensed and deposited at desired rates 
and degrees of hardness. 

Depending on need, the material can be deposited as 
a powder or a coating, and the buildup or deposition 
rate can be varied from 1000 to 250,000 angstroms per 
minute (250,000 angstroms equal one-thousandth of an 
inch) . 

A U.S. patent for the titanium carbide process has 
been issued to the Regents of the University of 
California, and information on licensing arrangements 
can be obtained through the Patent Administrator, 521 
University Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 
94720 (phone area code 415, 642-4777). 

Bunshah was one of the pioneers in the field of high 
rate physical vapor deposition in the early sixties and 
started the research leading to his present invention 
three years ago. A Santa Monica reSident, he has been 
on the faculty of the UClA School of Engineering and 
Applied Science since 1969. 

In future research, Dr. Bunshah will seek to tailor-
make titanium carbide coatings for specific applications 
by varying the compound's composition and 
microstructure . He is also working on the development 
and synthesis of other superhard materials .

IRVINE-Each audible sound-from the roar of a 
jetliner to a quiet whisper-is transported through the 
brain as an electrical Signal. 

Now this signal, isolated for the first time by Dr. 
Arnold Starr of UC Irvine, Is opening new areas in brain 
research and clinical diagnosis of a variety of sensory 
and nervous ailments, from hearing defects to brain 
tumors. 

After more than a decade of research on the auditory 
systems of animals, Starr has developed a specialized, 
ultrasensitive monitoring device capable of reading the 
deep auditory brain signals which course from their 
point of origin in the brain stem to the surface of the 
cortex over a complex neural pathway. 

" For the first time we can get information from the 
depths of the brai n," says Starr, an associate professor of 
neurology in the UCI College of Medicine and the 
Department of Psychobiology. 

The machine now is in use in the neurology clinic at 
Orange County Medical Center as a supplement to the 
electroencephalograph (EEG), which records gross 
electrical activity from the surface of the brain . The EEG 
is not sensitive enough to delineate deep brain waves 
like the auditory signal which Starr's machine picks out. 

"We now have a way of objectively relating electrical 
events in the human brain to the perception of sound," 
Starr comments. "The clinical significance is apparent. 
We can test"small children to see how well their brains 
respond to sound and determine whether they need a 
hearing aifr or are totally deaf. 

"A patient can be unconscious, and we can tell 
whether it is due to poison or to a blood clot or tumor of 
the brain . W~ can eliminate several time-consuming 
laboratory tests with this method. 

" The machine should prove to be a boon to resear-
chers," he says, " because it can enable them to measure 
directly what animals hear, instead of having to in-
terpret their behavior." 

Generated by a sound stimulus, the auditory signal 
threads its way the entire length of the brain through 
seven interconnective nerve centers " like a subway with 
many stops along the route," says Starr. 

"The exact functions of these centers, or nuclei, is not 
clear-but we know they extract and decode information 
from the signal and in turn generate a new signal," he 
adds. 

The machine plots the course of the auditory signal 
through the b~ain by reading the ambient t(aces of the 
signal at the surface of the scalp-much as an elec-
trocardiograph is used to record the electrical activity of 
the heart through electrodes attached to the skin 
surface. 

But the signal recorded by Starr's machine is at least a 
million times weaker than the heart's electrical signal. 
I n addition the auditory. trace may be virtually drowned 
out by an enormous amount of electrical activity 
generated from all parts of the brain . 

" The electrical potentials I'm dealing with end up at 
the surface of the head as a few billionths of a volt," 
Starr says. 

The machine consists of a set of earphones that 
stimulate the brain's auditory pathway with a series of 
clicks, a pair of amplifiers to boost the signal 100,000 
times, a filtering system to eliminate other electrical 
signals and a portable analog computer to average the 
signals and transform them into a readable graph of 
numner values. 

The line graph illustrating the signals shows a peak for 
each of the seven major nerve centers through which 
they pass and a number of intermediate spikes whose 
functions are not yet known . 

But to work out the function of each bump and 
squiggle in the graph will take a vast amount of ad-
ditional research at a time when grants for basic 
research are growing scarce, Starr notes. 

" If it hadn't been for the basic research I did with 
animals, I could never have developed this capability," 
he adds.
