Patient's Charges 

Union Describes Graft at UCSD Clinics 
The San Diego Union published an 

article Friday containing allegations of 
bribery and corruption at San Diego area 
methadone clinics operated by the UCSD 
Medical School. 

The allegations were made by a 
patient, I 36-year-<>ld Michael Layne, a 
heroin addict for 15 years who now takes 
methadone, a drug that in most patients 
acts as a substitute for heroin . 

Layne said, "It is a county policy to 
administer low doses of methadone to all 
patients regardless of their addiction 
background. But a low dose of 
methadooe, less than 80 milligrans, 
doesn't completely shut off that per-
sistent craving for us ." 

Layne described situations in which 
patients supposedly on methadone 
manage to conceal their heroin intake by 
bribing counselors to swap urine sam-
ples . He said, "The best way to remain 
clean, at least on paper, is to payoff a 
counselor to either falsify the findings on 
sample urine checks or to switch bot-
tles." 

Layne told the Union that such activity 
occurs at all five UCSD-run clinics, and 
that it has in some cases been en-
courageu by clinic personnel , who stand 
to profit . Some of the counselors are 
former addicts . 

Low Turnout in 
Revelle Election 

by Jeff Tidus 

Eight students were elected last week 
in Revelle College's annual elections for 
The Undergraduate Student Council 

. (T .U.S.C) and Revelle Committee on 
College Affa rs (R.c.CA.). 

The new T.U.s .C representatives are 
Jane Ferguson and Mark Liska . T.U.S.c. is 
the school-wide student government 
with representatives from each of 
U .CS.D.'s colleges. 

The new R.C.CA. members are Tim 
Cohen, Linda King, Robin Mitchell , Mark 
Rispler, Susan Schaefer, and Paula Smith. 
The R.CCA. is responsible for spending 
the college/s share of the vending 
machine profits. It also makes ap-
pointments to various student com-
mittees. With the exception of Paula 
Smith, all of the students elected are new 
to their office. 

In addition to the election of T.U.S.C 
and R.CCA. members there were two 
impatant questions decided. The first 
was on the new plus/minus gradin8 
proposal which was defeated by a sizable 
majority. This vote was taken to inform 
the faeu Ity of student opinions on this 
issue. Also decided was the name for the 
Student Center. 300 students voted 
qainst all of the names, with 43 votin8 
for the Triton Union, 14 for DieBeno Hall, 
and 2 for T arey Center. 

A man Layne accused of tampering 
with urine samples, who became a 
counselor and later assistant director of 
the I ndia Street clinic before losing his 
job recently, admitted he had done so. 

unknowingly purchased stolen property 
from a patient two years ago. 

I n addition, Layne said he and his WIfe, 
also an addict, had contributed at the 
Market and Harbison-5treet facilities to a 
fund that would supposedly help supply 
coffee and soft drinks for the clinics 
Layne said he had discovered later that 
the county pays for the coffee at the 
clinics, and that he suspects the money 
" went into the pockets of clinic per-
sonneL" 

The man, Peter Cortez, 45/ told the 
Union that drug dealing between 
patients and counselors is common at all 
the clinics, and that patients who want 
more methadone can obtain a recom-
mendation for same from a counselor he 
has paid . 

Cortez said payoffs come in money, 
drugs, favors, and sex. The author of the Union story, Patrick 

Dillon , wrote that he had asked at UCSD 
where the money had goner but had 
received no answer. 

The Union story also contained an 
admission by Harbison Clinic assistant 
director Fred Lord that he had 

Prices Up 1 1 %, Says CALPIRG 

Prices are up but com-
petition is keener among 
San Diego supermarket 
chains, according to the 
results of CALPIRG's latest 
food price survey taken 
early this month. The study 
also showed San Diego's 
inflation rate is growing 
m~re slowly than the 
national average. 

The survey, th'e seventh 
taken by the California 
Public I nterest Research 
Group, indicates the 
highest and lowest rated 
supermarket chains are only 
six percentage poi nts apart 
in overall pricing . That 
compares to a difference of 
11 points on the last survey, 
taken in November. 

FedMart won agai n as the 
lowest priced store, overall, 
on . the survey . Second on 
the list was K-Mart. FedMart 
has been the lowest priced 
store on all seven CALPIRG 
studies. 

Alpha Beta ranked last 
place on the survey, the 
highest priced chain 
overall. "Consu mers are 
being rpisled by Alpha Beta 
advertising claims that their 
prices are among the 
lowest," warned Dan 
Franklin, CALPIRG director. 
"Our survey indicates that 
'you won't like the total '

The Deed 
I" which COII"lerc.lllJre meels CrJlllre losi"g 

miserably. 
The Bank of America in Isla Vista carries more 

student accounts now than any other bank in town . 
Probably because all its windows were broken three 
years ago before rioting UC Santa Barbara students 
burned it to the ground, the new B of A has no glass 
windows, though no one in Isla Vista would be inclined 
to throw a rock at it now, anyway. 

Twenty-five thousand people assembled in that town 
last Saturday to listen to the Grateful Dead in the UCSB 
stadium. It was a concert I felt I had to go to ("The Dead 
like Santa Barbara," someone had told me), but I was 
not sufficiently compelled to get in the line at six in the 
morning. Others were, however, because the line was a 
half-mile long when we arrived at nine, 30 minutes 
before opening time. 

The line was assembled on a six-foot wide asphalt 
sidewalk . Movins on either side of it were people 
running for office, people working for candidates, or 
people lobbying for religious movements. All these 
manner of beast · were almost completely ignored 
because, I decided, people were excited about seeing 
the Grateful Dead. 

I began to unders~nd the temper of the crowd a little 
later on, when policemen riding big, brown stallions 
arrived to ride up and down the line. 

Since the line was, most of the time, not moving, and 
since it was growing warm, some people had chosen to 
sit on the grass on either side of the walkway. The 
policemen would stop their horses near anyone seated 
and make the person stand up and return to the asphalt. 
Once told, no one strayed back again to the grass. 

I was bothered not by the policemen's orders, nor 
even the fact that their orders were followed, but by the 
expressions of complacent, polite obedience with whi ch 
they were followed . 

For some reason, it made me think of having seen 
Jerry Rubin, Renne Davis, and Tom Hayden on the Dick 
Cavett show last March . I had been struck by the look of 
frustration on the face of Hayden, who is the only one 
of the three still involved in trying to end the war in 
Vietnam, as he listened to Rubin justify his full-time 
occupation with feeding himself organically and Davis 
his following of Guru Maharaj Ji "The revolution will 
continue-the government'is falling apart," they said. 

The mean ing of the day was now clear. We had come 
from all over California with our plastic jugs of mixed 
drinks and smugly bearing our small illegalities to 
immerse ourselves in the anonymity of 25,000 very 
similar people. We fed off each other: a representative 
sampling of our generation, listening to music that four 
years ago spoke for the mystical, unconscious side of a 
vital new cu lture, but which is no longer balanced by 
the more tangible music of the groups that have since 
fallen aside, no longer able to produce. (Was it because 
the Jaggers and Kantners just wrote themselv~s dry, Dr 
because they cou ld no longer sustain singJe-handedly a 
cu lture that was dying?) 

The Grateful Dead sa~g many of their familar songs, 
and sang them as carefully and cleanly as they ever did . 
They lost their audience only when they stopped singing 
and allowed key to slip away, letting their instruments 
delve into the soft, random improvosation (nothing like 
the audacious virtuosity we're accosted with today) that 
once meant something, and had a context, and tended 
to inspire rather than bore. 

But they played Sugar Magnolia, and Truckin' (a song, 
ironically, about continuing), and pleased us im-
mensely, the now and future bourgeoise that the Dead 
suddenly find themselves playing to, and that doesn't 
deserve:J them.

Fiction/Mark McCarty 
John kept his mother in the 

freezer . This would seem cruel and 
uncaring, except that John's 
mott~r was dead, and so it was just 
about the best place for her. John 
was just dOing his best to keep her 
fresh and unspoiled. Of course, he 
didn't keep her there all the tim~ 
she needed a social life and a 
certain amount of variety like 
everyone else--and so John would 
dress and undress her, and give her 
showers, and feed her and 
deodorize her; and he kept a chart 
for her and gave her her monthly 
protection whether she needed it 
or nOt. And once in a while he 
would dress her up smartly and 
prop her up on the sofa, and his 
friends would come over and they 
would all play bridge: His mother 
would always be the dummy, of 
course, but she wouldn't mind; and 
John knew tha t she really enjoyed 
these evenina flings . 

John knew that his friends 
thought him a bit odd, that they 
couldn ' t figure out why he 
wouldn't treat his mother in the 
callous way that other children 
treat their dead parents. And he 
also knew that behind -his back 
they were saying that he was shy 
and afraid of girls, and that he was 
downright--well, 'et's not · be of-
fensive. But that was before Sara 
moved into the apartment next 
·door. 

••• 

Sara had long dark hair and a 
shapely body. John had only a few 
fleeting gl impses of her after she 
first moved in . He was attracted to 
her, but much too shy to make any 
social advances. But one Sunday 
afternoon when John was attending 
the Church Bazaar, he went to the 
charity cock ring (cock-fighting 
was his favorite sport) to see the 

action. Just by chance Sara was 
there too. He saw her, and their 
eyes met. She obviously 
recognized him and so he boldly 
walked over and struck up a 
conversation. He was delighted to 

Lf 

find that she was religious too (his 
friends also made fun of him for 
that) and was really surprised when 
he found out that her high school 
colors-green and orange-had been ' 
the same as his . And that they both ' 
had ' friends who were plumbers. 
And that they both liked pistachiO 
ice cream . John couldn't remember 
when he had had so much in 
common with a girl. 

In the days that followed, John 
now and then would work up the 
courage to knock on Sara's door 

and stand there and talk with her 
for a few minutes . Not about 
anythinl in particular-just to be 
neiahborly;and friendly. Of course 
he never actually entered the door-
-he was afraid that that miKht seem 
aggressive, and he didn't want her 
to think that he was a rapist 01' that 
he didn't have respect for her as a 
total person . 

One day he knocked at Sara's 
door, and she opened it, and he 
noticed that there was a rnan 
sitting in Sara's living room. John 
excused himself and wanted to 
leave, but Sara asked him to stay, 
and said that the man was her 
father, and wouldn't , he like to 
meet him? And so John went in and 
met Sara's father . John liked Sara's 
father very much . In fact, he liked 
Sara's father !D much that suddenly 
he knew that II WAS RIGHT! He 
stared at Sara long and hard and 
hopefully. 

••• 

The wedding was very beautiful. 
John and Sara made sure that it was 
a proper religious wedding . There 
were many pretty flowers of all 
kinds, and orchids for the bride and 
groom. John and Sara had invited 
all their friends . And there was 
plenty of pistachio ice cream for 
everyone . 

The large new Frigidaire F.reezer 
that John and Sara bought for the 
newlyweds was big enough to hold 
two comfortably . John took care of 
his mother just as before, and Sara 
took care of her father, but often 
John would take his mother to visit 
Sara's father in Sara's apartment, 
and of course vice versa. John and 
Sara made sure that the two were in 
their freezer by ten every night--
and were very careful to give them 
all the privacy that they wou Id 
need ti II the next morning. 

Spiegelman to Joiri

Dr . Sol Spiegelman,

accepted a prefessorship at

Medicine .

doctorate at Washington 
University in St. Louis , in 
1944.

With this acceptance 
Spiegelman also announced 
plans to establish in San 
Diego an I nst itute of 
Molecular Medicine-a non-
profit center for cancer 
research supported by Life 
Sciences, Incorporated, of 
New York. 

Until Spiegelman for -
mally joins the School of 
Medicine staff he will 
continue in his present 
position as Director of the 
Institute of Cancer 
~esearch at Columbia 
University. 

Chancellor McElroy said 
of the acceptance, "The 
resources and expertise that 
Dr. Spiegelman and his 
:!SSociates will bring to San 
Diego will give it the 
potential for bei ng one of 
the most important cancer 
research centers in the 
world". 

Spiegelman has been 
involved in molecular 

He initially gained 
preeminence in the cancer 
field by being the first to 
demonstrate that an in-
fected virus tissue could be 
distinguished from normal 
tissue by a molecu lar 
hybridization process 
which he developed. 

Recently he used the 
same technique to detect 
"mal ignant" messages in 
the RNA and the DNA of 
cancer cells which are not 
present in healthy cells. 
With this technique a study 
of identical twins, con-
ducted with Dr. William G . 
Baxt , UCSD Assistant 
Professor of Medicine, 
showed that the twin with 
leukemia had a viral in-
flammation in its cell DNA; 
the other twin did not, 
prOVing that the viral in-
flammation must have been 
introduced after fer-
tilization, and was not 
genetically inherited from 
the parents .

meeting, le~ture after 
lecture, legal advice, about 
a hundred letters, and 
probably a few extra hours 
on their pay checks while 
David Buchbinder ran 
around like wet chicken 
yelling, I'm going to sue! 

Leven, a person of great 
legal knowledge and 
education, cited the Joyner 
vs. Whitinll cas,e . Or as I 
have reviewed it, the 
Blackie vs. Whitie case . 

It seems as though there 
is a discrepancy in the 
similarity of the two 
situations and can only be 
exp lained as a racist 
comparison. 

The case involved a 
predominantly black North 
Carolina State University 
opposing the schools policy 
of recruiting white students . 
In the front page editorial 
(see April Fools front page 
for comparison). the editor 
encour aged students to, 
Murphy said, "harass and 
in timidate" any white 

student that came on 
campus. The school acted 
to permanently cease 
fundinll of the paper, a 
decision that was overruled 
by the court of appeals in 
the Fourth District. 

Most studenls do not 
realize that no attempt was 
made and if any, to reject to 
take funds away from the 
Triton Times, only to 
dismiss an editor whom 
many thought to be , 
slanderous, defamatory and 
rae ially insensitive to 
"people of color." 

"The implications of the 
case are . impressive, " 
Murphy said . "It makes it 
virtually impossible to act 
against a student 
newspaper , unless the 
editorial policy involved 
obscenity, defamation , or 
the advocacy of violence." 

"Defamation," Murphy 
said . What does he think 
the April Fools articles 
were? He either has 
reading comprehension 
problems or his idea of a 
good joke is racist attacks 
on "people of color." The 
use of the Joyner vs . 
Whiting case, in my

opinion, was focussed on 
because the editor was 
black. The administration is 
trying to say that "you 
didn't want your editor fired 
and we don't want ours 
fired." 

When it comes down to a 
minority against a white in 
a predominantly white 
society, the minority always 
loses. 

Students, your money has 
been wasted on this paper. 
It stands now that no action 
has, or will be, taken 
against the Triton Times . 

The only d ifference in the 
paper is that there are now 
two, cou nt them, two 
minority people on the 
staff, with the exception of 
a Japanese -Mexi can 
American, and he only 
counts as two more as far as 
the Triton Times is con-
cerned . 

You have a right to 
implement certain policy ' 
over this paper since your 
money is being used to 
budget it . The only action 
you can take that is your 
right, is to demand that 
your money be taken out of 
the Times budget.

Larry Deckel , calls it " News to 
Peruse", I call it " Etceteras". 
Whatever the title, it merely spells 
BS and record-biz bruhaha for your 
edification and enjoyment. 

On the news front : 
Ousted Columbia Records 

president Clive Davis is rumored to 
be headed for the presidency of 
Bell Records . Davis was fired from 
his Columbia post in June of 1973 
for his alleged roll in payola and 
payola cover-up activ iti es at 
Columbia. Since that time he's 
been in the market for a new 
corporate post, one which may 
have opened up last week when 
incumbant Bell Records president 
Larry Uttal announced he was 
leaving the label to form his own 
independent record company. 

Ian Hunter, lead singer for deco-
glitterband Mott the Hoople, has 
written an autobio appropriately 
called "Diary of a Rock Star". 
According to the book's publisher, 
Panther Books, advance orders 
exceed 40,000. 

The reformed Electric Flag are 
currently recording at Miami's 
Criteria Studios. Unfortunately for 
both the band and its new label 
(probably Atlantic Records) due to 
certain ,Jnspecified legal dif-
ficulties, the band must use a 
different mon iker . The original 
Electric Flag, who recorded at loast 
1'/, superb albums in 1969-1970, 
included guitarist Mike Bloomfield , 
organist Barry Goldberg, bassist

Harvey Brooks, and drummer 
Buddy Miles. The personnel line-up 
in the new " Flag" has not, as yet, 
been announced. 

On June 3, Asylum Records will 
release a two record set culled from 
the Bob Dylan/ Band tour of early 
74 . The package, which lists for 
511 .98, will be backed by the 
largest promotional campaign in 
Asylum Records history. 

Ex-Beatie producer George 
Martin is presently supervising 
recording activities for folk-rockers 
America on their soon to be 
completed album . The LP is being 
prepared in London . 

Also in London : The Moody 
Blues, putting finishing touches on 
their long overdue eighth album. 
It's currently in the final stages of 
getting a space-age quadraphonic 
mix. 

A gala dinner party was held at 
'LA's Bel-Air Hotel last week, 
celebrating the formation of Swan 
Song Records. The new label is 
owned jointly by the four members 
of Led Zeppelin and their manager 
Peter Grant. It was Grant who 
threw the star-studded party, at-
tracting, among others, Groucho 
Marx, Rolling Stone Bill Wyman, 
Billy Preston, members of ELO, and 
Maggie Bell. 

All four ex-Beatles are presently 
in London with John Lennon and 
Ringo Starr staying well out of the 
publ ic eye . George Harrison is 
recording material for his next LP 

Greg Leonard 
(with Billy Preston 's help) . Paul 
McCartney is readying his band 
Wings for a return stateside in four 
or five weeks to begin recording 
their next . 

And lastly : Though streaking 
may not have set any new stan-
dards for human wit or 
imagination, it did generate one 
very successful pop hit, "The 
Streak", for country star Ray 
Stevens. Having been released only 
seven weeks ago, the single has 
already passed sales of 3 million, 
and thereby eclipsed sales highs for 
past Stevens hits including 
"Everything is Beautiful " and 
"Ahab the Arab". 

According to Stevens, "I read the 
story about streaking (in a national 
magazine) and clipped it out, 
thinking perhaps that if it became a 
popular fad I could write a song . So 
I began writing a song and then put 
it aside. Streaking did become 
popular-or at least it got plenty of 
publicity--so I completed writing 
the song one weekend, went to the 
studio on M onday and recorded it. 
It was one of those things that 
happens every now and then that 
makes this business fascinating." 

Stevens' next release is a song 
parody of the "Midnight Special" 
TV -con cert series entitled 
"Moonlight Special". " It has wild 
characters and voices in it, sort of 
like 'Ahab the Arab' ", said Stevens .

Do you want to have a 

good time-now, I mean a 
really good time? Listen 
here, bunkie, there are ways 
but there are a few 
requirements. You gotta be 
able to laugh at yourself-
like REALLY laugh at 
yourself . That doesn't mean 
that you won 't get to laugh 
at others, but unless you're 
extremely lucky or talented, 
you will be laughing at 
yourself first . So what kind 
of jive am I giving you now 
half right? 

You've seen pretty 
strange things in this 
column but you're about 
ready to start throwing darts 
at Chet's picture for this 
onel (Yes, that was Chet' 
Chebunski 's picture in the 
paper last Friday--right 
there in full size living black 
and white-cor«ratu lations 
to all of those of you who 
guessed--I ike it was really 
difficult.) Let's start the 
story another way. 

Everyone is aware of 
what a ,good job Lee, Harry, 
Gary and the rest of the 

bozos over at the In-
tramural Department are 
doing. How involved have 
you been in the program? 
Are you on a softball, 
volleyball or the latest fad-
floor hockey team? Face, it, 
everyone needs to get out 
of the library, room, or car 
and get away from those 
books and do something 
fun out in the sun for once. 
An exceptional way of 
doing this is through in-
tramurals-anyone of the 
above mentioned or even 
all of these as some do. I 
still haven't gotten to the 
point yet . 

The rest of the above 
mentioned sports all have 
their advantages. Everyone 
knows how to play baseball 
(more or less) so everyone

PE Dept. Gains 
New Supervisor 

Striking a blow for all women on the UCSD campus, a 
new face will join the Physical Education Department 
next year. The new face is that of the new PE Supervisor 
Diana Dann . 

Outstanding in aquatics, Diana is coming to this 
campus from UCLA as UCSD's first female full-time PE 
instructor. 

She arrives backed by a most impressive set of 
recommendations, and has worked on research projects 
with renowned professors at UCLA. Her research in-
cludes work for the United States Navy and on a book 
soon to be published called How to Swim: The Four 
Competition Strokes. 

At the present time she is working on a book of her 
own, which concentrates on underwater exercises. 
Miss Dann is also holding down two jobs in the Los 
Angeles area, as part time supervisor at both UCLA and 
Pepperdine College . 

As Rart of her duties at UCSD next fall, Miss Dann will 
be teaching swimming, tenniS, conditioning and 
volleyba ll. In addition to her regular teaching duties, 
she will most likely be coaching an intercollegiate team . 

type of league they want. 
Let's face real ity, some 
people are going to be 
better than others. The 
truth is, there is a sport that 
serves as an equalizer. That 
is coed innertube water 
polo. 

The sport has grown over 
the last couple of years . 
Last year there were 
fourteen teams and this 
year there are over twenty 
teams in three leagues. To 
be truthful, there are two or 
three exceptionally good 
teams who have been 
around awhile and know 
the game quite well. To be 
equally honest, there are a 
whole horde more who 
know nothing about the 
game and don't even care if 
they know anything.

The innertubes serve as 
an equalizer making most 
athletes as good as the 
regular schmuck. Besides, 
everyone is equally as bad 
since water is not mans 
element, even in in-
nertubes-and there aren't 
many people who know 
much about the game. = 

sm. 6]a )>--_ __ ' 
This is where the fun 

comes in. Most participants 
spend a large amount of 
time laughing at their 
friends, who can't seem- to 
stay in their tubes, and then 
after they get done 
laughing, they end up 
falling out of their tubes. 
This is great for t heir friends 
who laugh at them .

Coed innertube water 
polo, except for a few 
exceptions, is played as a 
sport mainly for fun . You 
see, necessity forces it to be 
that way since nobody is 
any good. Next year Chet 

strongly suggests that yOu 
all get on a team . If you feel 
like having some fun on 
Wednesday and Sunday 
nights, you ought to go out 
and watch this year's 
performer s in action .

No Sense 
Editor : 

I would like to comment 
on Dave Darval's letter 
entitled "Ridicule" which 
appeared in the May 17th 
issue of the T.T. In this 
letter, he expressed concern 
over the T.1.'s ridicule of 
student minority groups on 
campus (April 1st issue and 
" New I mproved Jesus" 
advertisement) by the 
newspaper which they help 
to support financially . I too 
am amazed at what you 
have learned through the 
April 1st affair and D. 
Darval 's letter-NOTHING! 
To show this, the .recent 
letter entitled "Christians" 
which appeared in the May 
21st issue was so severely 
edited that it did not make 
any sense. The questions 
and apology presented were 
sadly quoted out of context 
and thus the opinion of the 
authors was not truly 
presented . I question 
whether the Editor's 
prerogative to twist what 
students want to say in their 
newspaper to fit his own 
personal bias is right! 

Mari Evans 

Terror 
Editor : 

The " long-range view" of 
the Middle East conflict 
which your editorial from 
May 21 pretends to present 
is highly distorted due to a 
number of erroneous 
stateme nts and parti al 
ommissions . 

Zionism-the movement 
for self determination of the 
Jewish people in its 
homeland-started long 
before the second world 
war. larg{' number of Jews 

immigrat .? ~ to Palestine 
since th · ~ turn of the 
century a' far as they were 
allowed tJ by the Turkish 
rule, and ' hen by the British 
one. The Jewish community 

in Palesti ne struggled 
continually for its liberation . 
from the British 
colonizators. On the other 
hand, the Palestinian 
Arabs never fought the 
British for their own self 
determination; their mere 
objective was opposition to 
Zionism . As a natural 
consequence, when in 1974 
most of the members of the 
U.N . (including all Eastern 
Block countries and ex-
cluding Britain) issued a 
resolution call ing for the 
establishment of two 
sovereign states in the area 
of Palestine, the Jews 
complied while the Arabs 
refused to accept that 
compromise. The present 
state of affairs in the Middle 
East is the direct outcome 
of the Arab attempt in 1948 
to eliminate the young 
Israeli state. 

As for the Arab terror, it is 
absolutely not "an act of 
misguided individuals." It is 
supported, funded and 
enthusiastically apotheo-
sized by Arab governments 
and public. as demon-
strated recently by the 
funeral of the three Maalot 
"heroes" held last week in 
Damascus. 

Can Israel not fight the 
hideous terror? How can 
that be done without hitting 
the terrorists in their bases 
in lebanon and Syria?

Lit Courses 
Editor : 

I am writing in response 
to two letters from Kim 
George complaining about 
the courses being offered in 
literature at UCSD. He 
complains, quite rightly, 
that too few courses are 
being offered ; he also 
complains, again quite 
rightly, that some courses 
are too large. He makes the 
point, which is entirely 
valid, that students should 
let the provosts and the 

Pale 6 Triton Times, May 28, 1974 

Department of literature 
know what courses they 
would like to see offered. 
So far, so good. But he 
underestimates the variety 
of offerings in the Spring 
Quarter of 1974, possibly 
owing to the somewhat 
confusing arrangement of 
courses in the Catalog. At 
all events, he deserves a 
circumstantial reply, with 
facts and figures . 

There are, as he says, six 
upper-division courses 
being offered in English 
during the present quarter. 
Three of these are seminars, 
in which the average 
enrollment is eleven : this to 
me is an agreeably 
teachable number. In the 
three other upper-division 
courses, the average 
enrollment is forty-three 
(not 100 as Mr. George 
estimates) . I myself much 
prefer a class of this sort to 
have an enrollment of 
about thirty, but the 
seminars have ' got to be 
paid for by larger classes 
elsewhere. In any event. the 
average seems to be going 
down : in the Spring of 1973. 
the upper-Oivisi on English 
courses (excluding 
seminars) averaged fifty-
eight. 

Next Fall , an im-
provement is in prospect: 
we are scheduled to offer 
seven upper -division 
English courses and three 
seminars. 

This quarter five upper-
division General literature 
courses are being offered 
which are of interest to 
those majoring in English : 
leonard Barkan is teaching 
a course in epic poetry; 
Saul Steier is teaching a 
course in the novel ; linda 
Durling is teaching an 
introduction to lyric poetry 
as is Wai-lim Yip; and 
Fredric Jameson is teaching 
a course in science fiction . 

In one of his letters Mr. 
George. complained that 
"there has never (to my 
knowledge) been a class on 

Wild Pets 
Editor: 

At the end school. 
students abandon their pets 
mistakenly thinkinl that it 
is kinder to liven them a 
chance a,ainst the 
elements than to send them 
to the Humaine Society. 
What often happens is that 
the animal is killed by a car, 
it slarves, it becomes fatally 
i" due to inadequate 
nutrition, or the pound 
picks it up and destroys it. I 
hope students will try to 
find new homes for their 
pets. If they cannot. I 
suggest they call the 
Humaine SOciety. S.D. 297-
1813 or in Encinitas 753-
6413. They will pick up an 
animal, but only on Sun-
days, for a S6.00 charge. 
Also cat owners can try The 
Friends of Cats, 445-4428 
(call after 12 noon) both 
these groups give animals a 
chance' to find new homes. 
Unlike Walt Disney's "True 
life Adventures" creatures, 
most domesticated animals 
can't make it on their own .

April Fool Upshot 
Editor: 

The rescinding of 
McElroy's decision to fire 
David. Buchbinder is a big 
joke. The whole issue is a 
big April Fools joke, 
because the Triton Times 
gets off . Since this is a legal 
matter, acquitted . 

The decis ion to fire 
Buchbinder was a teething 
ring to pacify the anger 
exhibited by minority 
students. With the threats 
by Buchbinder to take legal 
action, third students were 
aware that a white ad-
ministration would not 
support them entirely or 
even partially . The 
stoutness of McElroy's 
decision is like that of rice 
paper; ilcan be broken with 
the slightest touch . The 
Communications Board 

continued on pale ~ 
D.H. lawrenct: VI James 
Joyce." But Jack Behar 
taught a seminar in 
Lawrence in the Fall of 
1973, and would have 
gladly admitted such a 
student as Mr. George who 
has a high GPA. Perhaps it 
is not as generally known as 
it ought to be that ad-
vanced undergraduates 
with high GPA's are ad-
missable to graduate 
semindrs. with the per-
mission of the instructor . 

I am not providing this 
information in order to 
refute what Mr. George has 
said . because I am very 
much in sympathy with the 
spi rit of his letters. I n fact I 
hope more literature 
majors will e)(press 

CIA Plots in France 
by Charles Heimler 

In a sidebar to a story announcing Giscard d'Estaing's 
election to the presidency of France a week ago Sunday, 
a popular American daily asserted that the U.S. Central 
Intelliaence Agency (CIA) had formulated plam to 
hinder France's economy in the event of a victory by 
Francois Mitterbrand. d'Estaing's communist backed," 
veteran socialist opponent. 

Relying on information supplied by a former CIA 
agent, John Marion Wayne, the newspaper charged the 
CIA wit.h actively plotting to cause general social . 
economiC, and political havoc similar to alleged CIA 
operations in Chile after Socialist Salvador Allende was 
elected president there. Those operations resulted in the 
military coup and death of Allende a few months ago. 

The CIA's multi-faceted attack, according to Wayne, 
sought to cause uprisings among the French middle 
£lass. These were to include boycotts by French 
housewives, work stoppages by professionals and 
managers, and protests by preparatory school students 
on the steps of the presidential palace . Through leaking 
information to the world press, the CIA planned to give 
the impression that these demonstrations were the 
result of the French people's dissatisfaction with the 
programs of the new socialist government. 

Another aspect of the CIA's plan would have at-
tempted to destroy the cultural fabriC of French society. 
According to Wayne, he headed a phase of the plan 
which called for the dismantling and stealing of the 
Eiffel Tower and L'Afc de Triomphe by a corps of 
Yugoslavian midgets posing as circus performers touring 
France. 

Wayne told the newspaper that other segments of the 
operation planned to link the French kiss with venereal 
disease. Wayne said various French scientific 
organizations would be given grants channeled through 
the World Bank to e)(plore the increasing use of the 
French kiss with rising venereal disease rates . The rising 
rates were to be attributed to the socialist government. 
Papal proclamations were advise on the immorality of 
French kissing, warning Catholics that practice of such 
kissing could be a mortal sin, absolved only by at lea.~t 
two rosary recitations and a stations of the cross. 

Further plans, said Wayne, included having America~ 
Teamster Union organizers infiltrate French grape and 
wine industries . The organizers were to have been 
classified as NATO observers . It was hoped the 
Teamsters would incorporate some of their California 
vineyard union practices in re-organizing French 
workers . The planned effect of such efforts the CIA 
believed, would be to turn the French W\Jrke~ over the 
governing body of Teamsters International thus in-
suring their subjugation and control by U.S. 'economic 
mt4!rests. 

Wayne alleged that some ot tne proposed tuoolng tor 
the operation. dubbed "Frog legs," was to come from 
several American based multi-international cor-
porations. Wayne said that these companies were in-
terested in the proiect because they wanted to protect

Employment Notes 
Today the . specializati~n of labor definitely appears . 

to place the liberal arts degree at a distinct disadvantage 
in the professional employment arena (see Employment 
Notes, T.T. issue of May 21, 1974). Employers often seek 
~ople who have taken educational programs which 
give measureable kinds of degrees and credentials. 
Unfortunately, as Dr. Howard Figler, Director of 
Counseling at Dickinson College in the Journal of 
College Placement, Oct - Nov 1973, puts it, " liberal arts 
graduates today think of themselves as educated 
gadflies without homes or products that have no buyers. 
T~ have been socialized by the technocracy to 
believe that people get trained for jobs and that 
education is designed to place them on ' a suitable 
conveyor belt which will deposit them in the ap-
propriate job ceiL" 

Most graduates often fail to realize their own at-
tributes : For example, the ability to communicate well 
in writing, orally, or in creative media ' the in-
terdiSCiplinary viewpoint which enables them'to look at 
events from several vantage points, contributing to the 
possibility of inventive actions. 

Ce~inly th~ ~umber of college graduates aspiring to 
satlsfymg positions has outstripped the number of 
positions available. To begin lessening the potential 
disillusionment, students must make on their own or 
through programs (such as the Career Planning & 
Placement workshops) the conceptual jump between 
academic talents and the working world . Many em-
ployers are actually Quite flexible in accepting people 
without specific vocational credentials . Indeed, how 
many careers are actually straight-line affairs? Many, if 
not most persons are far afield from where they began. 
Ask them .
