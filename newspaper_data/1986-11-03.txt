Regents tackle 
problem of TAs 
By NANCY STIJMP, UC Wlrt 

P ROBLEMS with teaching assistants was one of the highlights at the UC Board of Regents first and "experimental" meeting on educational policy issues last Thursday, but the board did 
not take action on the problems outlined in a recent report critical 
of UC's undergraduate education. 

The regents held the one-day long meeting. the first of three, [0 
discuss long-range problems confronting the universiry. UC 
President David Gardner said the meetings are designed [0 
encourage the "training and education" of the board . 

All conclusions drawn bythc recently released report will be dealt 
with by the systemwide Academic Sena te and Academic Senates of 
the individual campuses. 

Teaching assistants are "one of the pans of the university 
with which we have less than full pride," said Neil Smelser, 
chai rman of the task force which compiled the report. 

T As teach one-third to one-half of all lower division courses and 
labs, said Susanne Weil , a membcrofthe task foree which compiled 
the popularly tenned Smelser Report. 

Regent Robert Noyce said TAs are a "technique of relteving the 
finanCial burdcn of havlI1g fu ll profcssors teach undergraduate 
courses. " 

He added thm pan of this va nation can be anribured to the faC t 
that UC has no general ~ystem for electing or monitoring TAs. 

"For man)' first- and second-year studellls, most interaction WIth 
th e teachers occurs with 1 As ." Peter Blackshaw, a repre entativc of 
th e University of Caltfornla Stuclent Associdtion told the regellis. 

"If tilese people arc nOt adequately trained as tearhers nOt ani), is 
th e students' learning in a pJl1icular class hampered , but the 
perceptions of the univer 'ity and education received may be 
diminished," he said . 

UC needs to establish more of an "a pprent Ice hlp program" for 
T As, requiring th em to mee! wlrh a faculty member on a weekly 
basis and requesting that TAs make a course outline well ahead of 
the beginning of the class "rather than two or three days before ," 
melser said . 

On some campuses, the only requirement T As must mect to teach 
a cour~e is to have satisfactorily completed it themselvcs. 

The regents have a ked for an addi tional <;750.000 in next year's 
budget for TA tmi ning, Weil said . 

The task (orce repon notcd th,lt problems olten occur when the 
native language of the TA b nO! English , Smelser sa Id . The repon 
recommended that TAs whose native JanglJage is not English 
should be required to pass a spoken English proflclcncyexam. 

Sm::lser saId the repon's request that th e quality 01 the foreign 
TAs be Improved was not mednt to "humihale or degrade" people , 
and that It IS possible that a I t of the criticism about TAs has come 
from swdenls com plai nmg about the language "as a from for 
another problem ." ~

year's most imponant initiatives on the state of California, 
perhaps the scribes are right. But the most frequently -spouted 
analysi s as to why the public has fallen prey to the deluge of 
elusive propositioners and candidates - that they are willing 
to sign anything on the ballot, regardless of its ludicrousness, 
just so they have some meager input into governance - is as 
belittling as it is insufficient. For the real problem of the 
initiative process appears not only in the vague and non-
binding way that most of the propositions were written , but in 
the entire electoral process. That problem is the excess of 
wealth being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, which 
equals diminished power in this "democracy" for the majority 
of the populace , which equals the ability of the powerful few to 
purchase state power through the use of the great intellectual 
booby-trap , which is television . 

The three most controversial propositions - Prop. 63, "The 
English -Only Amendment," Prop. 61, "The Gann Initiative ," and 
Prop. 64, "The AIDS Initiative" - are such undemocratic , silly, 
and ridic ulous proposals that they don't even belong in the 
20th-century, let a lone in the serious political arena . The races 
for the office of governor. for the senatorial seat, and for most 
of the races for congreSSional and California assembly seats , 
are prime examples of how the powcrbrokers have used their 
sniping authority to disenfranchise more potential voters than 
ever before . Polls indicate that Tuesday's election will feature 
the lowest voter turnout ever in California hiStory. And why 
not? The citizens of California have never shown a propensity 
for voting with their television sets, especially for a flock of 
candidates who are either too spineless to debate real issues, 
or who are so morally myopic that they can only campaign on 
frying prisoners, or keeping narcotics out of schools. 

Even the most Widely admired and humanistic candidates of 
the field have chosen to allow the boob-tube to suck up their 
time and energy; to cast-off an ethical Cranston, Bradley, or 
Chief Justice Rose Bird as a blipping image enshrined in soap 
opera-like rhetoric. But the real devils that seek to diminish the 
public 's knowledge of issues and government - the 
Deukmejians , Zschaus , Lowrys, and their corporate backers -
are more responsible for the imposed public apathy than 
anyone else . These are the men who, like the sheep that they 
are , follow the corporate wolves' strategy of only discussing 
themes ( like a "strong defense," or "entrepreneurship," or 
"innovation"), and never explaining the substance of their 
platforms. 

The greatest tragedy that may befall us tomorrow is that a 
very fine and impartial Chief Justice - Rose Bird - might be 
spent and TV'd our of the California Supreme COUrt by an 
ideologically possessed group of ultraconservatives who do not 
give a hoot about civil rights. This same group of Ideological 
affiliates of Ed Meese and William Rehnquist has targ;ed two 
o ther pro ponents of civil liberties for ouster - Justices Cruz 
Reynoso a nd Joseph Grodin . If these justices are not 
reconfirmed, we can expect Governor Duke (if reelected ) to 
a ppoint three justices as ideologically narrow-minded as he 
Oudge Joseph Wapner out of TV-land is a strong candidate). 

We interrupt -this line of th ought to bring you a very 
important message however, and that is to exercise your right 
to vote these TV-bloopers in and out of,office. If you do, 
maybe in 1988 we will be treated to a more realistic 
engagement of democratic politi cs.

Diego's uproar 
Due to the uproar caused by 

the appalling photograph in Club 
Diego's advertisement in the 
GuardIan last Thursday, and as a 
result of requests addressed !O us 
by a variety of individuals !O 
state our advenising pohcy 
concernmg such forms of 
dl cnminati.;m, we have set 
guldehnes for an adveni sing 
policy with respect to ads of 
thiS nature . 

While we reserve the nght to 
refuse any advertisement that we 
believe to be racist , seXIst, jradulent, 
illegal or offensive, The Guardian 
would lIke its readers to know. 1) 
we do not have the resources to 
check oJut the promises made by 

our adve rtisers; and 2) we have a 
strong abhorenc~ to ce nsoring any 
advertisement , espeCially if we 
disagree wah its polit icS. 

We regret any confusion 
caused by the appearance of that 
advertisement in our newspaper, 
and apologize !O each individual 
who was offended by it. We do 
not agree with that rype of 
advertising, and wiU continue !O 
fight discrimination in every 
instance that we are able to do 
so. 

We would encourage everyone 
who was offended by this 
advertisement to caU or write 
Club Diego's and voice your

A reverend's view of Prop. 64 they do mean well . But wheth er they arc tntentlonaUy evIl or

and MuslIms, athel tS and 

By GARY COMMINS 
I will ::t lw<t)'S gC t ::tnnoyed with . 

peo ple who h::tve simple answe rs 
to tragedies. I remember 
someone saying that an 18-
month-old girl had d rowned 
occ:ause "God needed another 
hule angel m heave n." I 
remember the mother-in -law of a 
22-year-old kIlled in an 
automobile accident saying that 

pe rh ap~ thiS was God 's wa)' of 
.lying her daughtel shouldn't 

have mamed hllll . 
The worst one w::ts whe n a 12-

ycar-okl girl was ~hol 111 the 
head by a siranger. SOllie bod)' 
suggested that the murder might 
be God 's Will The girl 's mother 
said , "No. God docsn't do th iS 
kind of thing." 

It 's a bit presumptuOus !O 
explain God's Will In Ih e midst 
of traged y, but that rarely slows 
peo pl e down. Our socitety tends 
to believe that it's people's own 
fault if th ey are poor, if they are 
sick. In the Middle Ages, 
scapegoats were foum] so that 
someone could be blamed for the 
plagues that dcva~ated Europe. 
It happened !O be the Jews. We 
can always find someone, some 
group , somebody differertl. 

AID has brought together this 
presumptuou ness about 
knowing God 's will with the 
tendency to blame people for 
their own tragedies. These 
people call themselves "religious" 
- and I suppose that they are. I 
just wonder what kind of God 

. they worship. They make bizarre 
accusations that AIDS is a divine 
punishment upon the gay 
community. Others combine fear, 
hatred , projection , superstition 
and misinformation to promote 
Proposition 64. Such ideas and 
actions can only be considered 
tragic, foolish , irreligious and 
blasphemous. 

The kind of Isolation that 
might result from the passage of 
Propos iti on 64 is remini sce nt of 
the barbaric treatment of lepers 
In times past. Lepers were 
Isolated because people did not 
understanu how the disease 
spread. Leper were con Idered 
"unclean " It was as<, umed that 
thei r leprosy was a result of their 
Sinfulness 

People have n't changed much. 
We prefer to sec evi l "out there ," 
111 somebody rise. pre fcrabl) 
someone we don't lI ke Victims 
of AIDS are mday's il'pcrs. 
victims not only of dheJ~, but 
of public vili fica ti on 

The responSible reilglous 
communi ry - the InterreligIOUS 
CouncIl of Southern California 
- has come out against 
Propos ition 64. They say, "God 
doesn't do thi~ kind of thing." 
They urge the same comp:l ssion 
lor the victims of AID that is 
offered to the Victims of cancer 
or heart disease. 

The InterreligiOUS Council 
offers an alternative approach 10 
the mystery of suffenng. It 
doesn't ofTer easy answe rs about 
why this epidemic has begun. It 
isn't arrogant enough to pretend 
to have inside infonmation about 
God's judgement. 

S1. Francis of Assisi feared 
lepers above aU things. But in his 
Testament, he said that their 
presence, which had once 
nauseated him, had become his 
greatest source. of comfort. There 
was a time when he was riding 
on his horse past a leper. He got 
ofT the horse , gave the leper 
some money, kissed him, was 
kissed in return , got back on his 
horse and rode away. Legend 
adds that he turned around 
moments later. The leper was 
gone . And Francis realized that

Like other KSDT volunteers, General Manager Frank Long and a disc 
Jo ckey are worhing 10 expand the alternative music station 's availability,

credlbiltt>"" Horwitz said . 
Horwitz expla1l1ed that preparing 
to apply for a FCC license "I a 
full -time job that takes a 
sophisticated and on-gOing 
effort. 

Horwitz realizes that most 
UCSD students have full course-
work loads, but emphasized thar 
It'S up to the students to get 
everything toge lher frolll writing 
petlllOnS to the orgal11zmg of a 
swuon log which explains how 
the station runs - frolll rormal

. If KSDT were to obtain a FCC 
license, th e station would go 
through some changes. Onc 
que tion IS whethcr or not the 
stations ab ility for the students to 
broadcast an alternative style of 
musi c and talent would be in 
jeopardy? Long said that the 
station does not want to lose 
control , but it would have to hire 
frolll one to three professionals 
including a full-tIme engineer 
and general manager. Long 
believes that personalities will still 
remain the same. "A FCC 
educational license would put 
KSDT more 111 th e public eye . I 
thll1k it would encou rge people 
to be more conservative," he 
adm its, "but I don 't think th e Dj s 
Will change th at much, they'll JUSt

and students will have th e 
0pp0rlunit)' to subscribe to cable 
,ervlce on a month to month 
baSIS. "If we put cable service in 
Ihe dorms, then the students will 
be able to get KSDT in their 
rooms. It will solve a lot of 
difficulties. outhwestem will 
gain student subscribers and 
student · will ga1l1 KSDT ," Long 
sdid. 

Long thinks that the future for 
cable expansion is promising, 
"Getllng cable on campus co~ld 
be a turning point for KSDT." It 
IS all dependent now on 
Southwestern , il they want to 
make the initial investment in 
installing the service or not ," 
Long added. 

Another pOSi ti ve step for KSDT 
is that Del Mar Cable is <lisa 
interested in featuring the radiO 
sta tion. "If we can get on Del 
Mar Cable and ge t cable on 
campus, then we will effectively 
be everywhere we would be with 
a FC license . Then our next 
tep would be to pubhcize tbe

Fulfilling filial duties 
By JOHN SINGH 

W ITH Ele ti on '86 contenders makll1g their f1l1al punches in 
dnticlpating of next week's 
general eleCllon , an unlikely 

. spokesperson for incumhcnt 
Lieutenant Governor Leo 
McCa n hy has been making Ill'; 
way through Cahforni<l and 
swpplng at schools to win 
SLlppOrt for McCanhy's 
reelection . 

Adam McCanhy IS the ,on 01 
current Lt. Governor, and if the 
elder McCarthy IS a bit 50h-
~poken regardll1g hiS reele tion , 
the younger IS using a uiffcrem 
method . He IS lI1form1l1g the 
public that hiS fa ther wants to 
win and i~ doing what he can to 
prevent a dcleat by th e former 
Ll. Govcrnor Mike Curb. 

" 1lke urb has been

the I line of the primal)' elections 
hiS I.Hher "[was[ behind in the

people had heard nothing of Leo 
McC.mhr. We're dbout six pO\m ~

alll1gether about seven points

The younger McCarthy's Views

Fighting for a seat 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 

T HE curre nt race for th e U.. enator from Cahforn la has be 'Qmc one 
of the more hard-fought, bitter 
campaigns in rece nt ),ear>, and 
IS certa inly among the mO!St 
expensive. 

Republican Congressman Ed 
Zs hau IS challengi ng II1cumbent 
SenatOr Alan ran to n for the 
seat the latter ,has held since 
1968. CrJnston, who has been 
reelected by wide margins in the 
pasl, is f .. ci ng whal many 
observers conSider a surpnsmgly 
strong ch.lllenge by fschau. 

The campaign , which has 
been waged largcl)' on televiSion, 
has becoille sOllleth i ng of a 
name -calling contest. Cranston 
has been cha rg ing that Zschau IS 
Inconsistent on many issues, 
uch as Mid-Ea t arms deals; 

Zs 'hau, meanwhtle , has been 
portrJying Cranston as weak on 
terrorism <lnd drug abuse. 

TeleVision ads, while hand y 
for getting a candidate's name 
,tnd up inions out to millions or 
people , are often ineffective at 
helping voters to understand 
redlly who the candidates are. In 
thi s case, each man has a 
distinct and fairly Interesting 
hi stol)' to look back on. 

First, the challenge r. Ed 
Zsc hau (pronounced like 
"shower" Wllhout Ihe -er) call s 
the CIty of Los AltoS, ncar San 
j ose, home. He went to 
Princelon , and later earned both 
an M.BA and a PhD. at 
Stanford . 

After a couple of short 
teaching SlIntS, he stallcd and 
became president of System 
Industries, Inc., a vel)' successful 
SI licon Valley manufacturer. At 

the same time, he was CUlll V<lting 
pol ltlcal cunnec tions, lobbYing 
pl'l lll.lri ly for high -tech Issues. 

Z~chJU ran for Congress lrom 
the twelfth uistri ct, which 
includes much of Siltcon Valley, 
in 1982. In the reo rg'l11ization of 
Caltlrl rn i..t Co ngressional dlSt tlct, 
by th e Democr.tt-conrrolled state 
legi sLtture ("genym,l11dering"), 
thi s di strict had· been made 
overwhel ml ngly Republicall , so 
that several nearb y districts 
would be primaril)' Democralic 
(111 voter regismtt lon). 

Runn ing for an open seolt, he 
put together such <In effiCIent 
campaign organi zation that he 
had no opposi ti on In the 
Repuhl ican pnmary. That same 
organ lzanon helped him to rai se 
more th,1l1 ten time, ,IS Illuch 
mOlley as his Democratic 
oppone nt; Zschau coasted to ,In 
C,ISY Victory in the Rcpubhcan-
domlnat't'd district. 1984 was 
much the same story. 

In ongrcss, Zschau has 
become somethll1g of a leader in 
the drea of high-tech Issues.' In 
IllOSI areas, his ideals seem to be 
those of a fairly moderate 
Republt 'an. He has voted for the 
Equal Rights Amendment, the 

uclear Frl'eze, and halting aid 
to the Colltras. On economic 
issues, howevcr, he can be more 
conservative. 

Alan Cransto n is something of 
an institution in Cahfornia 
politics. He calls Los Angele . 
hOllle , though he was born In 
Palo Alto, Just a few miles from 
where Z chau now lives. He 
graduated from Stanford with a 
BA In 1936. 

Cranston cenainly has some 
hi~tol)' upon which to look back.

Runntng lor the U.5. Senate 111 
L968, Cranston had a ditl!cult 
caillpalgn , evcn though the 
Republi can Incumbent had been 
defeated in the pnmM)' by an 
extrellle conservative. In hl~ 
19H .l11d 1980 co ntests, 
Cr.\I1ston won by large 11l ,lrgln::. , 
,llthough some critlcs altribute 

thi ~ rn the fa l' l that his 
LlppOnellt s In both races were 
lrom the tar right wing. 

An III -fated bid for the 
presidency in L9tH may have 
done some uamage to Cranston's 
reputation . Although tradlllona lly 
extremely popular in Cali 10 rill a , 
Cranston's very libeml Vle\vpolnts

number ot Calilornluns. 

A world-record holder lor hi s 
age group in the lOO-yard dolsh , 
Cmnston's thin , wiry phYSique

Unpack your bags: Tritons to stay home 
UCSD to host women's 
soccer regional 
By GUS SANTOYO, pon EdlCOI 

A s the women's soccer team waited for the phone call from the 
~ 
~ 

..< 

eM selection committee to 
find out where the TrItons would 
play their first Western regional 
game, several of the players were 
hoping they would get to fly to 
Minnesota, where the 
temperature IS currenty a chilly 9 
degrees. But after the decis ion 
was made that UC D would host 
the Far West-Midwest regionals 
this coming weekend , the 
players, at first dlsappomted, 
became ecstatic. 

team would be playing In 
Minnesota, but the review 
committee changed their mmds 
after seeing the strength of 
UCSD's s hedule. "All our losses 
have come to Division I and II 
opponents," said Leaney "and I 
thmk our schedule is the reason 

"------_ ......... < 

we get to stay home. eJ Chris Ladish, Adne/lc Clam, and Launt O'Connell will help lead the Tritons in the Westem Regional Final Sunday. 

Hoops 'n'Scoops 

"Looking at it realistically, I'm 
really happy we're hosting the 
reglOnals," said Chris Ladlsh. a 
senior forward . ,· It would have 
been exciting flymg, but thinking 
about it, It'S going to be great 
having a big home crowd 
backing us up. I can't walt." 

This job is anything but routine 

UCSD is seeded number one 
m the West and thus have 
earned a bye to the 
championship game on Sunday. 
The Triton's will play the winner 
of Saturday's match between 
Methodist College of North 
Carolina and St. Mary's College 
of Mmnesota. The nmes of the:;e 
games will be determined today. 

All this IS exciting to head 
coach John Leaney. who has lead 
this year's team to a 14-4-4 
record , one of the best in the 
school's history. "I'm very excited 
about this opportunity," said 
Leaney "and I'm hoping we can 
get a big crowd hke the men did 
for last year's playoff game I 
thmk a big crowd will defmitely 
help :,he perfo rmance of our 
team. 

O ngmally, Leaney th ought hiS

ROUTINE is about as appealing as chocolate-cove red garlic bread . Sleep, 
school , work , food , sex, it all 
becomes a jumbled maelstrom of 
blandness where even Madame 
Bovary reads like a Jackie Collins 
novel. 

Unfortunately, routine is the 
foundation of efficiency. IBM, 
Ford Motors and the Los Angeles 
Dodgers are bureaucratic 
monsters of effiCiency running 
on gobs of routine . Everything 
organized , everythmg ordered, 
everything boring. 

Little did I know that routine , 
the one of waking up after eight 
hours of sleep, eating a heany 
breakfast of huevos rancheros 
with tortillas and coffee, 
digestmg every word m lecture 
With ardent fervor, studying m 
HL with Intense concentration , 
and then in bed by eleven would 
become as obsolete as a Calvin 
Schiraldi fastball . 

1 guess I didn 't know what 1

Well , I get the feeling neither that there is no routine. Game

nobody cares about the athletic when I was watching the 1974 
depanment. I'm finished raving AFC playoff game between the 
about the absurdity of thiS Oakland Raiders and the Miami 

~hoo\'s involvement in Division Dolphins and it was my 
111 , but sometimes even the guys indoctrination inro the 

exci tement of Sports. I'll never 
forget Curt Gowdy's voice as the 
Raiders had the ball on the 
Miami eight yard line, trailing 
26-21 with 26 seconds left on 
the clock: 

"Stable r's hack to pass, 
scrambles, Den Herder's got him, 
no wait, DAVIS CAUGHT THE 
BALL! I DON'T BEUEVE IT!!!" 

I was in my bedroom watching 
the game, jumping up and down, 
not because the Raiders won, but 
because I had discovered my 
calli ng in life. 

So here I sit 12 years later, in 
front of this word processor, 
dressed like Oscar Madison, 
eati ng a lemon Hostess fnlit pie, 
a Bud Light in my right hand , 
and sandpaper scrub o n my face , 
several inches of lard on my 
belly and wondering if It'S all 
worth it. 

For some strange reason it is 
because there 's no routine and 
it's JUSt the beginning. Just the 
very beginning. eJ

M ORE than 12 ,000 students attend classes here at UCSD each day. 
The basketball team, however, 
would be lucky if one half of one 
percent of the students 
supported them at anyone 
game. That is only about 50 
people. Students here are 
missing out on the opportunity 

to take prIde In an athletic

Foul lines 
Continued from page 13 
content with the fact tha t UCSD 
would live or die with its 
academic reputation , Resea rch 
and academics have certainly 
prod uced a leadi ng ins titution, 
but unfonunately, the same 
athletic philosophy remains, 
There is a notion that exists 
within the administration that a 
top-notch athletic program 
simply cannot co-exist with an 
ins titution based upon quality 
academics and research , I 
strongly believe that they can, 

Without providing 
sc holarships there is no way to 
significandy implOve our athle tic 

program at UC D, Granted , we 
cJo have one of the top Divis ion 
III sc hools in the nation , but this 
is an accomplishment that WIll 
never keep a school of 12,000 
students interested in athletics, 
Our teams are com peting with 
many schools one-quarter the 
size of ours, and have a definite 
disadvantage when competing 
with schools comparable in 
enrollment to UCSD. Our teams 
are JUSt short of bei ng able to 
compete with Division I and II 
teams, Potential gai ns aSSOCiated 
with offe ri ng athletic 
scholarships are ignored . Givi ng 
scholarships would enable our 
sc hool to attain those individuals 
who could greatly enhance the 
quality of a prestigious institution 

su h as UCSD. A strong athletic 
program would wake for a more 
invi ting, diverse and popular 
university, 

Part 01 the students' apathy 
toward Intercollegiate athletics is 
due to the independence of the 
four separate colleges. So much 
of a student's time is invested in 
activities and requirements of an 
individual college, that UCSD as 
a unified university suffers. 

Opponents might argue that a 
rigorous quality academic 
program cannot be maintained if 
a strong athletic program were 
installed . It's true that extreme 
care would have to be taken, but 
there are numerous successful 
athletic programs that coeXIst 
wi th schools known to have top 

norch academiC reputations. Dr. 
Jack Gourman, for example, 
publishes a report rating 
undergraduate programs In 
American and international 
universities, UCSD is ranked 
13th of the leading institutions 
(Gourman 137). Of the 20 
universities, 14 are noted to be 
in the top 18 sc hools li sted for 
having successfully combined 
athletics with academics 
(Gounnan 130), UCSD, 
unfo rtunately, is not one of them . 

Another important criticism to 
consider is the fact that it would 
COSt money initially, Sponsors, 
however, could be sought to take 
care of a large part of it. One 
goal of a strong athle tic program 
would be to grow to the point 

Monday, November J, 2986 1.5 
SPORTS 

where ticket sales and media 
rights would surpass input. By 
providing scholarships and 
improving our athletic status, 
UCSD could potentially make 
money with this program, 

One program the athletic 
department really deserves to be 
commended upon is UCSD's 
intramurals, The rremendous 
suppOrt and involvement has 
served to counterbalance some of 
th e interest and emotion that our 
intercollegiate teams lack from 
students. 

As it stands, enough people 
within the administration feel 
content with th e existing 
philosophies concerning athletic 
scholarships to prevent change. 
Something must change, 
however, to accomodate for the 
projected 20,000 enrollment of 
the year 2000, The present 
athletic program can't maintain a 
student interest in intercollegiate 
sportS. Scholarships should be 
gi ven to improve the quality of 
our teams, thereby unifying the 
four colleges, building a more 
diverse, attractive university and 
potentially proVIding an income 
to benefit this great 
institution , ~
