Varga named to 
statewide body 

On affirmative .action 
BY MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 

Staff Writer 

The UC Student Body 
President's Council Tuesday 
named a UCSD student, 
Kerr y Varga , a s it 
undergraduate representa-
tive to the s ix -member 
Statewide Affirmative 
Action Committee. 

Varga, a third -year 
sophomore attending Third 
College, was picked from a 
field of three because , 
according to Linda Sabo, 
Chairperson of the Student 
Body President 's Council, 
" she wa s very, very 
qualified ... her resume was 
very impressive." 

Three UCSD scientists not baffled 
by discoveries that stymied JPL 

Varga , an urban aDd rural 
s tudies major, who was 
informed of her appointment 
for the first time by The Daily 
Guardian, agreed with Sabo. 
• 'I've had a very strong 
background in affirmative 
action," she said. Her list of 
activities includes service on 
the Affirmative Action 
Retention Committee, the Ad 
Hoc Committee on Recruit-
ment and Retention and the 
United American Indian 
Students, of which she was 
Vice-Chairperson. In addi-
tion, she is currently the 
Third College AS representa-
tive and serves on various 
other committees with 
assorted functions . 

The Statewide Affirmative 
Action Committee, which 
consists of one undergradu-
ate student and five faculty 
mem bers, advises UC 
President David Saxon on 
matters of 2ffirmative action 
and takes interest in whether 
or not the campuses are 
fulfilling the goals of 
affirmative action.

Three UCSD scientists 

travelled to Pasadena's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory last 
week for the Saturn 
Enoounter, an information 
session held while Voyager 1 
was sending back photo-
graphs and data from its 
sweep past Saturn. 

The scientists, Hannes 
Alfven, Asoka Mendis and 
Walker Fill ius , wanted a first 
hand look at the returning 
data to see if it was consistent 
with theories they had 
developed for the origins of 
Saturn's rings. 

Voyager I has provided no 
lack of data. Professor 
Alfven, who has written a 
textbook on the origin of the 
solar system, characterized 
the probe as providing "the 
most important and immense 
amount of data about Saturn 
gathered at a single stroke." 

Saturn's rings have 

puzzled scientists for years, 
and these new photos and 
data did nothing if not add to 
their intrigue, they said. 

What was previously 
thought to be a structure of 
three to six rings, turns out to 
consist of some 500 to 1000 
ringlets, of widths of about 10 
kilometers. JPL scientists say 
they are "gettin~ tired of 
counting them all. ' 

The larger num ber of 
visible rings is mostly a 
result of the finer resolution 
of Voyager I's photographs. 
The rings are still arranged 
in three major bands, the C, 
B, and A bands, the C being 
closest to the planet, with a 
smaller band, the F band, 
located outside the A band. 

The finer resolution has 
revealed an entire set of 
smaller rings between the B 
and A rings, in the "Cassini 
Region" named after the 
French astronomer who first' 

BSU crowd prompts 
AS support of Tolbert 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
Staff Writer 

. T,Jae Black Students Union 
turned out over 40 members 
for last night's Associated 
• udents Council meeting 
and ."t in return a 14·0 vote 
backmg the tenure bid of 
Black History Professor 
Emory Tolbert. 

The resolution charges 
UCSD with havi~a "vicious 
manner of racism, ' and gives 
full and active support to 
(Tolbert's) demand that he be 
given tenure." 

"We brought all these 
people here to show we're 
serious," BSU Vice-
Chairman Daryl Ellis told the 
council_ "Every student who 
knows him thinks he should 
get tenure." 

BSU Chairman Ken 
Overton added, "This is our 
history that they're 
threatening to take away 

from us, and we're not going 
to let them do it." 

Hill cited figures that show 
that the university employed 
36 Black professors in 1974 
but now has only 18, and 
argued that Tolbert got a raw 
deal when the department 
voted two years ago not to 
grant him tenure. 

"His field of research was 
Marcus Garvey. There was 
no one in the history 
department qualified to judge 
that, so we asked others in 
the field . They said his 
research was at least 
adequate, and some said it 
was very good_ So we wrote 
letters to everyone we could 
and people told us it was 
influential in getting him a 
two-year extension. 
"Now he's coming up again, 

pleaae tum to p81e 6 

identified four . 01 Saturn's 
moons. These Cassini Rings 
are 20 times less brilliant 
than the other rings, and 
thus were never visible from 
the earth, since Saturn's 

ri~ ar urrounded by a* 
thick mist 

But the most intriguing 
findings of Voyager was the 
discovery of a braiding 
pattern in the outer F ring, 
and dark spoke like patterns 
in the B ring. Photographs 
revealed the F ring to be 
composed of two rings 
seemingly twisted or braided 
about each other. In the B 
ring, dark spoke like areas 
rotated with a different 
period than the rest of the 
ring. 

At first, JPL's scientists 
were at a loss to explain the 
findings . Upon first seeing 
them, they released state-
ments to the press such as 
"these findings are inexpli-
cable with our knowledge of 
the laws of physics." Their 
theories, though , took into 
account only the effects of 
gravity on the particles, but 
not electromagnetic fields. 

The finding s were 

perfectly explainable under 
the theories developed over 
the past 20 years by Alfven, 
and refined by Mendis. For 
t his rea s on apr e s s 
conference was hastily 
a rranged for Monday 
morning to explain the 
braided rings and radial 
spokes. 

These theories deal with 
the effects of Saturn's 
changing electromagnetic 
fields on the particles 
surrounding the planet. They 
say that the dark spokelike 
regions consist of dust-size 
particles which can acquire 
an electric charge. These 
charged particles then ride 
around the planet in 
synchrony with Saturn's 
changing magnetic fields. 

Similarly, the braiding 
pattern could evolve as a 
result of electromagnetic 
forces on intermediate-size 
particles. Larger particles, 
above one centimeter in 
radius, would be most 
influenced by gravity and 
maintain a circular orbit, 
while particles of a radius of 
around one micron would be

In addition to Varga 's 
resume, Sabo said that 
another reason why Varga 
was picked was "the fact that 
she is actually an affirmative 
action constituent. " Al -
though Varga 's mother, Bev 

. Varga , is Dean of Third 
College, the younger Varga 
feels that her mother's title 
was probably unbeknownst 
to the committee which 
selected her_ Her mother did, 
however, encourage her in 
the beginning. "That's how I 
got involved when I was a 
freshman ," Varga aid. 

In her one-year term, 
Varga, who is part American 
Indian, said that she hopes to 
expand what officials call the 
"eligible pool, " which , in lay 
terms, is simply that group of 
minority students qualified 
for entran ce into the 
univers ity. 

She said that "by 1990, the

Carter's turn to the 
right · abandoned nz • 
Editor: 

It is interesting to note that 
your paper remains able to 
find space for nearly a page of 
anti-new indicator rhetoric 
while sitting for over a month 
on our response to the attack 
penned by CSEA's executive 
board. 

This latest attack (The 
Daily ' Gttardian, Nov_ 12) 
bears no apparent relation-
ship to the headline which 
appears above it ("Creeps 
refuse to separate church 
from state"). Instead it seeks 
to argue that the - left in 
!Jeneral, and the "ew 
,Ndicator in particular, have 
elected - or helped to elect -
Ronald Reagan to the 
presidency. 

A m<re reasoned analysis, 
however. would discover that 
Carter lost the election not 
because his constituencies 
abandoned him, but because 
he abandoned his constituen-
cies. Under Carter we have 
seen increasing militarism, 
increasing inflation, increas-
ing unemployment and 
increasing attacks upon the 
rights and Jiving conditions 

_ of people not only in the US, 
but abroad as well. 

On the international scene, 
Carter is supporting a 
reactionary, repressive 
military dictatorship in EI 
Salvador, a regime which is 
literally massacring its 
people in a frenzied attempt 
to prevent a broad-based left 
coalition from taking power. 
Carter is not only providing 
arms to the Salvadorean 
junta, he has sent military 
advisors as well . 

No Democratic party 
candidate can expect to be 
returned to office without the 
support of the traditional 
democratic party constituen-

cies. To quote the Nat jon, one 
of very few liberal or leftist 
publications which came out 
In s upport of Ca rt e r . 
"Obviously, the Democratic 
Party, with its deeply flawed 
incumbent President , a man 
who has abandoned even the 
mildly populist promises he 
made in 1976, has not earned 
our supporL_His cynical 
disregard for hi s 1976 
campaign promi ses -
cutting the defense budget. 
for example - has made 
suspect the more attractive 
proposals he has permitted 
his speech writers durin~ the 
last weeks of his campaign ... 
(president Carter) is, if 
anything, ve~ much a part of 
the problem,' This was in an 
editorial encouraging readers 
to vote for Carter. 

Thus , it is Carter's turn to 
the right, a turn which has 
abandoned those people 
whose support he needed to 
secure re-election and has 
resulted in great hardships 
for . many people, which has 
resulted in his defeat. 

Jim Crosswhite also claims 
in his commentary that our 
editorial position misunder· 
stood the basic nature of the 
elections. He then goes on to 
state that elections are not 
the time to support 
candidates whose policies 
you support or send a 
political messa~e. What , 
then, are they for?Why, they 
are to create a consensus and 
to give our stamp of approval 
to those elected . And he 
wonders why we say that we 
want no part of it. 

If elections are, as both we 
and Crosswhite contend , 
merely exercis es held to 
legitimize existing systems of 
domination , then there is no

Condemning liberals only widens gap 
Editor: 

Regarding Jim Cross-
white's column (The Daily 
Guardian, Nov. 13): 

You spend so much energy 
condemning al\ liberal people 
because we didn't do enough 
to get Jimmy Carter re-
elected t ha t you are 
alienating the very forces 
that need to unite to show 
that America's majority does 
not support more killing of 
judicial\y processed human 
beings, a constitutional 
amendment banning abor· 
tions (support for bringing 
unwanted people into this 
world just to end up in that 
judicial process), inhumane 
regimes throughout the 
world, a decrease in the 
minimum wage, pushing 
women back into t he home 
and a general policy of 

helping the rich get richer 
and forgetting everyone else. 

The only way that any of , 
the above actions can be 
thwarted or changed will be 
through action of the people. 
The legi slators have their 
lands ide. They have their 
" mandate." They will 
proceed to carry it through 
unless something s tops 
them. Only cons tructive 
political action (letters, 
groups, etc.) by the people 
who are about humanity will 
stop them. , 

The American people are 
already di senchanted and 
alienated. U s ing the 
condemning, shaming, guilt" 
inducing tact ics of the 
" moral majority" only 
widens this gap. 

[ would like to believe that 
the majority of people in this 

country real\y don't want al\ 
of the above reforms or 
regression s. Chastising 
people for not voting or voting 
incorrectly only pushes 
people away. To survive, we 
must remain united. 

Or perhaps [ am wron? -
is this majority "moral ?'

Not to blame 
Editor: 

Poli tical ({ction needed 

In response to the letter 
"Unite for Orgasms" (The 
Daily Guardian, Nov. 12), we 
as women would like our say 
in this matter. During any 
sexual activity , part of the 
pleasure is achieved by being 
able to satisfy your partner. 
The other par t is the act of 
sex itself. To use an old 
expression, "It is bette r to 
give than to receive." Any 
man that feels he has been 
oppressed by "devious female 
sex u a l-politi c king " and 
blames his inability to have 
multiple orgas ms on the 
female gender, obviously is 
un confident in his own 
sexual abilities . [f men want 
mult iple orgas ms, let them 
get them on their own. 

Editor: 
[ write in support of Jim 

Cross whi t e ( Th e Daily 
Guardian, Nov. 13). With 
hopes of redu ci ng t he 
problem .he describe , I urge 
progress ive students to join 
politically active groups. 

The "Carter table" people 
are still around and we need 

help. We've lost the election 
which means we must figh t 
harder for our beliefs and 
ideals. We need concerned 
s~udents to form a group 
aimed at progress ive action 
ra ther than ineffect ive 
lamenting.

LGIERS, Algeria -
The s peake r of [ra n 's 

'par liament said yesterday 
acce ptance " in principle is 
not 'enough" and called on the 
Uni ted States to carry out t he 
Iran ian conditions for release 
of the 52 American hostages. 

" If the United States 
decided tonight to imple.ment 
the conditions, then we will 
rel~ase the hostages 
tomorrow ," Hashemi 
Rafsanjani told a news 
conference in Algiers. 

If the US government 
implements the conditions 
gradually, he said, "then we 
will release the hostages 
gradually. " 

Rafsanjani , who held the 
news conferen ce after 
meeting with Algerian 
President Chadli Bendjedid, 
said, "The solution is in the 
hands of the US govern" 
ment. " The change from a 
Carter administration to a 
Ronald Reagan administra-
tion in the United States "is 
not our problem," he said . 

Algeria has acted as 
intermediary between the 
United States and Iran in the 
matter of the 52 Americans 
held captive in [ran since 
militants stormed the US 
Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979. 

Rafsanjani said whenever 
the decision to release the 
hostages is taken, they will 
be handed over to Algerian 
officials in Tehran. "It will 
then be up to Algerian 
government to decide how 
they should be. sent home, 
either directly or' through 
Algeria," he· said. . 

A European diplomatic 
source in Algiers said 
Rafsanjani's statement 
seemed "at first sight" to be a 
rejection of the partial 
American acceptance of the 
Iranian conditions. "It could 
also be a smokescreen for an 
abrupt decision to release the 
hostages, a kind of face-
saving," said the source, who 
declined to be identified .

To Federico Garcia-Lorca (on his 
"Ode to Walt Whitman") 

Federico Gorcia-Lorca was a 
Spanish /JOet who recognized in Wa~1 
Whitman's />Mtry a prototype of h,s 
o",n homosexual feelings . He 
twoj«ttd this against the dismal 
btlckdrofJ of depression era New York 
City, and the tainted, sten!otyped 
behavior of "fairies. II 

It ought to flow; why isn't it 
flowing? 
They have dammed Niagra Falls, 
they have wrestled with the bull-
and would you be a river?-
they have cut away his balls 
let there be thirst... 
... but today I see cracks in the 
Hudson, 
see the brave man's beard grown 
lush and long 
heading out past Fire Island; 

To Heather-

I had a strange experience 
Just the other day, 
I build up all my courage and 
Told a friend that I was gay. 
At first I got the strangest look 
And then I got a half-a-smile, 
She said in quite a jesting way 
She'd thought that all the while. 
She said it really didn't matter 
For what she liked was me, 
For nothing could come between us, 
Not my sexuality. 
We're now more close than ever, 
Me and my partner in crime, 
For honesty is what friendship 's

desperate places . 
lingering in lavatOries bulging 
spying _ 
indicating with handkerchiefs and 
gestures flying, being 
effusive, Federico, .was not for you. 
Federico, too sure was the grey 
unanimous face 
that blinks, and promptly puts you 
in its place. 
Feel a certain agony, 
poet of the drowning fish . 
soul of walls in su bway statIOns, 
effaced; . 
your words are brother to the hsp-
wound of lipstick 
stain of alcohol-
listen to them, echoed in forced 
effeminate tones 
choked-on, Federico, like splintered 
wishbones. 
Where is Walt Whitman when you 
need him? 
Where is the broad welcoming palm 
sprouting nestlike 
sprouting womblike 
from the soil of Manhattan? 
There were words. . 
And we were courageous, weren't 
we? 
And we were immortal, weren't we? 
Federico, I rage for you, 
for the aged beard; 

, for passions which-at once-
we loved and feared. 
I rage for strong innocent wrists 
made supple and supplicant 
white flags fluttering. 

Book Review: Consenting Adult 

This novel by Laura Z. Hobson 
covers a thirteen year span in the 
life of a woman dealing with her 
son's homosexuality and circum-
stances that developed for her as a 
result of it. Her son was seventeen 
and in a private boarding school 
when he wrote a pointed, sensitive 
letter telling her of his sexual 
preference. The mother, Tessa 
Lynn, encouraged him to seek 
psychological the~apy , as ~e 
desired. Her son Jeff s therapy did 
not last more than about two years, 
but the positive support , she 
provided continued on as he 
changed and accepted himself. 
Although the book discusses the 
manner in which other family 
members dealt with Jeff's ' 
homosexuality, most emphasis is 
placed on Ms. Lynn's feelings and 
actions. 

The book is written in a narrative 
style. Jeff's emotions are not cove~ 
in depth and leaves the reader With 
questions regarding~ what :s 
happening in his mind. Ms. Lynn IS 
just a bit too flawless, enough to lead 
one to question her believability. 
However, the reading is interesting 
and leaves one with a bit of 
knowledge on the gay movement 
during the late sixties and early 
seventies and is presented in a non-
judgemental , objective manner.

All my love, 
Charles 

Dear Charles, 

A serious mind boggling problem 
has recently come up in my life, one 
which is very delicate, so I thought 
I'd write to you and ask for your 
advise since you are my closest 
friend' and I trust your opinion. 
What happend is a long time friend, 
whom I have known since I can 
remember, and who I have' l~ved 
ever since I can remember, (since 
the first day I met him) wrote me 
and told me he was gay. Now this 
presents a problem - not in the fact 
that he is gay (becuase you and I 
both know that doesn't matter) -
but because how do I tell this person 
that I don't really judge a person on 
who he prefers to sleep with_ But 
again, I must emphasize, the words 
chosen must be carefully 
constructed so as not to sound 
alarmed, or too carefree on the other 
hand. I realize that it took a lot of 
courage and trust for that person to 
have finally told me, after all these 
years - for all I know it could have 
been bothering him for months to 
tell me and I don't wanttosound too 
flippant and just blow it off like it 
doesn't mean anything. I want the 
person to know that he could have 
talked to me about it anytime, and I 
would have liked to be there when 
he finally realized it. 

Then again, I want to reassure 
this person I do know the 
consequences of gayiety, and that I 
realize that, it is.not a "disease" like 
many of the ignorants of the world 
profess. I do know that it can be a 
traumatic realization for the person 
because this is the way he is. And 
that is fine with me. 

But I don't want too sound too 
glad when I tell the person how I feel 
because he probably won't believe 
me and it will just add to not 
believing anything I tell him. (You 
see I don 't know how touchy a 
subject it is with him and in what 
respects it is touchy). What I do 
want the person to understand is 
that I love him very much and love 

the fact that he trusted in me a very 
personal thought of his own. I want 
him to know that all the years 
together haven 't changed because of 
his preferance, and all the years to 
come will still come even if he 
decides to choose to become a mass 
murderer. I'll still be with him, 
what ever he does because love 
doesn 't change, it just grows. 

I love you , 

Heather 

The Restaurant: Cafe du Trottoir 
The Location: 1027 University 
Avenue, Hillcrest, 291-1735 
Type of Food: Omelets and crepes 
Price Range: $3.50 to $9.50 
Hours: Open daily. Sunday, 8:30 am 
to 11:00 pm; Monday through 
Wednesday, 11:00 am to midnight; 
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 11:00 
am to 4:00 am. 

Close to Mr. Dillon's bar/ disco is 
the Cafe du Trottoir. a wonderfully 
appointed eaterie which serves only 
omelets or crepes. Freshly cut 
flowers and fresh fruit from a huge 
bowl add to the charm of the 
"Sidewalk Cafe." , 

My friend and I had a choice of 
twenty-one omelets and sixteen 
crepes not including the homemade Leban~se desserts. My friend's 
Crepes du Thon (tunafish) were 
stuffed with slightly dry tuna but 
the crepes themselves were thin and 
delicate. My Omelette du Liban was 
filled with spicy ground lamb, 
potatoes, pine nuts and onions 
dabbed with a bland Swiss fondue 
sauce. Each entree was served with 
freshly sliced cantaloupe, tomato 
and lettuce. The small, lukewarm 
loaf of bread and butter was just 
enough for two. Cafe du Troittoir 
does not have a liquor license but the 
good coffee continually'refilled more 
than makes up. 

We also had dessert, a wonderful 
miniature rum cake and a flaky 
pistachio baklava. At $3.75 each, 
they are a bit pricy but delicious, 
nonetheless. Our entire bill came to 
$18.56, a little over $21 with an 
obligatory tip. .. 

Our only complaints concented 
the service and music. Classical has 
played before but we ate t() KYXY 
and used car commercials. As for 
the service, unfortunately it is still 
careless and unpolished. We were 
rudely rushed through our fruit but 
the staff was gracious and very 
friendly. Cafe du Troittoir offers a 
delightful menu variety, incl~ding 
red caviar omelets, in a charming 
atmosphere but the service needs 
polishing.
