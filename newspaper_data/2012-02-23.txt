SURF REPORT

Staff Writer

The University of California is collecting 
and analyzing data to determine the most 
effective ways to recruit and attract qualified 
women and underrepresented minorities 
in the fields of Sciences, Technology, 
Engineering and Math. So far, the university 
has received four grants for a total of $2 
million to fund this research thus far. 

“[The] UC received [National Science 

Foundation] grants to support our efforts 
to attract top quality women and under-
represented minority faculty to STEM 
disciplines,” Director of Media Relations for 
the UC Office of the President Steve Montiel 
said in an email. 

The UC system has appointed four 
principal investigators to earn grants that will 
be used increase diversity within the STEM 
discipline. Susan Carlson — the vice provost 
for academic personnel at the University 
of California — is one of the principal 

investigators working to earn grants for the 
10 UC campuses.

“Because of our location and the strength 
of our academic programs, we should have 
the most diverse STEM faculty among the 
nation’s research universities,” Carlson said 
in a Jan. 14 UC Newsroom article titled 
“New grant projects aim to improve hiring of 
women, minorities in STEM fields.”

Carlson initially sought out the grant 
to analyze hiring data provided by the UC

The General Store at the Old Student Center is now accepting Triton Cash payments. 
According to General Store member 

Tauri St. Claire, the General Store’s main 
goal is to create the most accessible 
environment for students. Members said 
that accepting TritonCash will make lead 
to easier transactions. 

UCSD graduate and G-Store member 
Joe Virgilio suggested this change at one 
of the store’s weekly meetings early last 
quarter. 

Virgilio runs the record store within 
the General Store. 

“Everyone was really for the idea... 
we decided the benefit of the Triton 
Cash demographic outweighed the cost 
of installing the new machine,” member 
Tess O’Hanrahan said. 

After approximately a quarter 
of discussion, the General Store and 
Triton Card Accounts Services came 
to an agreement culminating in the 
installation of the new machine inside 
the General Store.

“A lot of students are strictly on 
Triton Cash for whatever reason, so this 
makes the G-store more available to 
them,” St. Claire said.

Student Organized Voter Access Committee, a UCSD organization, has registered approximately 1,700 students 
to vote, putting UCSD in second place for 
number of students registered to vote among 
the UC campuses. 

SOVAC registered approximately 1,300 
students during the Fall Quarter move-in 
period. This brought the voter population 
of UCSD to approximately 15 percent. UC 
Santa Barbara has the highest student voter 
population in the country, with 38 percent of its 
students registered to vote. 

According to SOVAC Administrative 
Director Carl Welliver, a high voter population 
makes universities more important to politicians 
in their campaigns and policy choices.

“When Jerry Brown started his campaign for 
Governor of California, he started at UC Santa 
Barbara,” Welliver said. “I think that shows 
how significant a change in voter registration 
numbers can be.”

Prior to SOVAC, only six percent of UCSD 
students were registered to vote, the lowest 
percentage of voters among the UC schools.

“[UCSD experienced] a much higher 
registration in [SOVAC’s] first year [due to 
the organization’s methods of reaching out 
to students], which is significant because it is 
an off-election year,” SOVAC External Press 
Associate Mina Nilchian said. “Next [fall], 
when we’re doing the presidential registration, 
it will shoot up.”

Student Organized Voter Access 
Committee pushes campus 
registration to 15 percent.

I f nothing else, “The Artist” — director Michel Hazanavicius’s film about love in the age of Hollywood transition — proves that style is sub-
stance. The critical darling features nuanced acting, 
an effective storyline and a beautiful score, but it will 
always be known first and foremost as that silent, 
black-and-white film in the era of CGI. 
      The storyline is simple: A serendipitous meet-
ing between silent film star George Valentin (Jean 
Dujardin) and aspiring actress Peppy Miller (Berenice 
Bejo) link the pair as Miller goes on to become a “talk-
ie” star and Valentin’s fame fades in time to the demise 
of his medium. The pitch-perfect expressions and 
gestures of the leads, combined with the universality of 
the story, give “The Artist” an edge over front-runners 
like “Hugo” and “Midnight in Paris.” Hazanavicius’s 
“love letter to cinema” is sure to take home the top 
prize come Feb. 26 — for novelty, for sheer originality 
and for being a nostalgic reminder of what Hollywood 
used to be.

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography researchers 
discovered that coral reefs can 
thrive extreme cold-water 
conditions. The study, conducted 
in 2010, was the Ph.D. thesis of 
former Scripps student Melissa 
Roth and Project Scientist in 
Scripps’ Marine Biology Research 
Division Dimitri Deheyn. 

It is the first study ever to 
address how coral reefs react to 
a colder climate change. Many 
studies have been done about 
the effect of a warming climate 
change on coral reefs. 

Those studies have shown 
that coral reefs eventually die 
in environments with increased 
heating. 

“The reason why it’s important 
to look at that aspect is [because] 
when you do research on climate 
change, most areas on earth warm 
up but some areas cool down,” 
Deheyn said.

Each study lasted three weeks. 

Roth and Deheyn worked in the 
Scripps experimental aquarium. 
They placed coral in water kept at 
5 degrees warmer and water kept 
at 5 degrees cooler than normal. 

There were three conditions of 
water: warm at 26 degrees Celsius 
(normal temperature for corals), 
very warm at 31 degrees Celsius 
and cold at 21 degrees Celsius. 
The corals were kept in individual 
jars because the scientists wanted 
to ensure that if a coral’s stress 
response could be accurately 
isolated. 

The researchers found that in 
the first week that the corals liked 
the warmer environment better. 

“They were like, ‘Oh this is no 
big deal, you know I can deal with 
warmer temperature,’” Deheyn 
said. “But then after a week their 
health declined very, very rapidly 
and they bleached and eventually 
they were close to dying by three 
weeks.” 

The warmer environment 
sped up the corals’ metabolism 
and enzymes. This situation was 
not sustainable because enzymes 

could not keep up with the sped-
up conditions. The enzymes 
began to break down and the 
algae living in the corals left.

Corals have a symbiotic 
relationship with algae. Most of 
the energy the coral receive is 
from symbiosis. When a coral 
undergoes stress, the stress is 
transferred to the algae, often 
causing algae to leave the coral. 
“Bleaching” occurs when algae 
leave coral because the coral turns 
white. The colder environment 
was hard on the coral in the 
first week. The corals were not 
growing and their metabolisms 
were lower. 

“We thought those would 
eventually die first,” Deheyn said. 
“But after a week they stabilized 
and they started to adapt and 
thrive again in colder conditions.” 
Deheyn and Roth do not know 
the exact cause for the corals 
surviving in colder temperatures 
but they have a few theories: 
They think the cold tolerance 
means that the coral enzymes

UCSD’S Priority Deadline for filing the FAFSA is 

system in order to determine the 
next step toward increasing gender 
and cultural diversity within STEM 
fields on UC campuses. 

Carlson discovered that the 
UC system has fewer women in 
STEM fields than most nationwide 
statistics. 

The grants will also go 

toward funding round table-style 
discussions in order to discuss 
recruiting techniques with faculty 
and staff from the 10 various UC 
campuses. 

“We know that we serve diverse 
students, and research shows that 
these students are more successful 
when they have faculty members 
who share similar backgrounds 

and experiences,” Carlson said.
Several workshops have already 

been planned including women of 
color in STEM fields at UC Irvine, 
faculty review processes at UCSD 
and Latina issues at UC Davis. 
Dates have yet to be determined.

Marshall College Student Council and Warren College Student Council 
visited A.S. Council Wednesday 
night, continuing 
the college 
council visits that 
began one week 
ago. Marshall 
College brought 
cupcakes. Warren 
College brought 
nothing. Step up 
your game, Warren.

Fred Qafiti and Samera Yousef 
of Students for Justice in Palestine 
presented the annual “divestment 
proposal” to council. 

The proposal calls for the 
University of California to 
divest from General Electric and 
Northrop Grumman, since those 
companies manufacture parts for 
helicopters used in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. This issue has 
been brought to council every year 
since 2009.

“Last year, we were so close to 
getting something passed, but a few 
members of the opposition opposed 
[the proposal] and so it was 
scrapped,” Qafiti said. “It is highly 
unrealistic to think that everyone’s 
prerequisites can be met before the 
resolution can be passed.”

Tritons for Israel President 
Daniel Friedman said he was 
hopeful that a compromise would 
be reached. 

“We can move for a dialogue 
and see the conversation start right 
here, right now, and find a solution 
that doesn’t offend either side,” he 
said. “I would be damned if this is 
my last year and we can’t find some 
way to fix our mistakes.”

Council will vote on the 
proposal during the Feb. 29 council 

meeting if a council member 
decides to sponsor the proposal. 

AVP of Academic Affairs Mac 
Zilber will be stepping down 

from his role 
at the end of 
the quarter 
due to early 
graduation. 
Council was 
sad to see 
Zilber leave, 
but welcomed 

Sammy Chang as the interim AVP 
of Academic Affairs.

AVP of College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbit reminded council three 
times that Council Mixer will be on 
Monday.

“There will be free food,” he 
said. “Delicious food.”

Muir Senator Leah Wong was 
late to the meeting today because 
she was filming UCSD’s segment 
of “Shit Broke UC Students Say” 
YouTube video. I’m hoping that one 
goes viral.

Congratulations to Advocate 
General Courtney Hill for 
receiving the distinguishing 
Councilmember of the Week 
recognition. 

She high-fived Council to the 
“Party Rock Anthem.”

University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair Nicole Metildi 
brought a University Centers 
Referendum before council, 
opening up a heated debate.

“I don’t know why anyone 
would be worried about extra 
eyes on their budget,” Engineering 
Senator Parminder Sandhu said. 
“If they continue to do their jobs, 
[the proposed A.S. oversight] 
shouldn’t cause conflict.”

Council tabled the referendum 
until next week.

Voter Reg. Group Allowed to Table in Library
According to Welliver, SOVAC 

is the first student organization that 
has been allowed to table in the 
library. 

The organization tables during the 
first two weeks of every quarter.

“We teach the know-how of voter 
registration so that when you’re off 
in the adult world, you know what 
to do and you know how to register,” 
Nilchian said.“[For example] you 
have to re-register every time you 

change your address.”
Two UCSD students founded the 

organization last spring. 
The organization was integrated 

into A.S. Council during the 
beginning of Fall 2011.

SOVAC works with student 
activist organizations at UCSD, 
such as College Democrats, College 
Republicans and Young Americans 
for Liberty. 

The organization is also active 
with other UC campuses, especially 
UC Santa Cruz, UCLA and UC 

Berkeley, to help increase the 
number of students registered to 
vote statewide.

“We’re constantly gaining new 
contacts and will hopefully expand 
nationwide,” Welliver said. “SOVAC 
members are strictly non-partisan 
while conducting official business, 
and that our relationship with 
various political groups will never 
compromise our neutrality.”

and the source of the energy 
slows down the metabolism of the 
organism, whereas in the warmer 
temperatures the enzymes work too 
fast and create stress for the corals. 

“The pure mechanism of why 
it happens — it’s species specific,” 

Deheyn said. “It’s something that is 
worth investigating, but is probably 
due to the limits of terminal 
tolerance from the enzymes that 
made the corals.”

Roth is now based at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory. 
Deheyn said that he will continue to 
study corals.

“I was inspired to look at the 
affect of other stressors on corals,” 
Deheyn said. “We now work, for 
example, on the effect of metals on 
corals which are perimeters that also 
are important for the coral reefs.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Listen closely: It’s the rumble of several thousand Republicans desperately searching for any 
alternative to the current clown car of 
Republican presidential nominees. 

They have every reason to worry. 

The current standard-bearers of the 
party, namely Romney and Santorum, 
are flopping and floundering through 
a race where the main opponent, 
President Obama, has less than a 50 
percent rating in the midst of high 
unemployment and a still-tanking 
economy. And yet, the race still seems 
up in the air, even now. 

Romney has cast himself as 
candidate-in-waiting for several 
long months after watching political 
folly after folly fall to the wayside 
(Bachmann and Cain) but yet, this 
late in the race, still cannot thoroughly 
knock out his final overzealous, 
off-putting social conservative foes. 
Santorum, the previously stated foe, 
has a theological belief system that is 
so disturbingly far-right that not even 
the Republican party thinks he has a 
shot of beating Obama. 

The polls aren’t looking much 
better. Romney may still see himself as 
the frontrunner, but in January he was 
handily trumped by Newt Gingrich 
in South Carolina, a state that has 
chosen the Republican nominee since 
1980. And just last month, Romney 
lost Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and 
key swing state Colorado to Rick 
Santorum. If that isn’t grim enough, 
polls for Michigan, the next big 
Republican contest is pointing at 
Santorum. This wouldn’t be too 
surprising, except for the fact that 
Michigan is a state where Romney 
was born and raised. And if Santorum 
was to (likely) take Michigan, he 
would essentially be crowned the new 
frontrunner of the race.

Hence, the panic.
The instability of this race has 

led the GOP to talks of a “brokered” 
convention come the party’s August 
convention in Tampa. The last time a 
race has been this undecided was in 
1976, when party insurgent Ronald 
Reagan narrowly lost to incumbent 
Gerald Ford, who later lost the 
nomination all together to Jimmy 
Carter. This brokered convention 
would require the Republican Party 
to cuckold any willing potential 
candidate to take the nomination in 
Tampa. Some names being thrown 
around are Indiana Gov. Mitch 
Daniels, former Florida governor Jeb 
Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 
or you know, just about anybody with 
a conservative agenda and an ability 
to speak in public without referencing 
lipstick pit bulls or pizza deals. 

All that’s left to do is sit back and 
watch the drama unfold until August. 
Romney still has a chance of snagging 
the nomination, but his chances are 
fading when he can’t even fend off 
his main rival, Santorum, a man who 
literally called career moms out for 
being selfish in his 2005 book “It 
takes a Family: Conservatism and the 
Common Good.”

Obama’s looking better every day.

The 2011 UCSD student elections were like our version of the 2000 presidential election, only instead of “hanging chad,” the key word was 
“grievances” —  formal complaints filed against any 
member or action that has violated election bylaws. 
A total of 25 grievances were ultimately filed against 
various slates and referenda camapaigns that year 
— seven of which were appealed to the A.S. Judicial 
Board — delaying the results by an unprecedented 
three days.

Basically, we had ourselves an unprofessional 
shitshow that demonstrated severe need for elec-
tion reform. Thus, A.S. Council created the Election 
Appeals Board in spring 2011, which members 
of the Judicial Board now claim violates the A.S. 
Constitution. In the end, however, it mostly just serves 
to add unnecessary steps to the election process.

Under the new section, Section 5.5 in Title IX 
2011-12 of the Constitution, individuals can appeal 
the sanctions or decisions set by the Judicial Board. If 
at least three members of the Appeals Board — com-
prised of the chairs of each College Judicial Board 

— decide to hear the case, the Board can overturn the 
original ruling if the J-Board acted inappropriately. In 
essence, the Appeals Board retains sole jurisdiction 
over determining whether the Judicial Board acted 
with bias.

According to a presentation at the Feb. 15 A.S. 
Council meeting, the new section impedes the Judicial 
Board’s ability to make decisions, ultimately bogging 
down the appeal’s process even more. 

It’s true: By adding another step to the process 
— the Appeals Board in addition to the J-Board 
and the Elections Committee — appeals could take 
even longer than last year’s three days, worsening the 
already unprofessional potential waiting period. But 
the main issue with last year’s election process was the 
fact that the grievances took so long to come in; thus, 
according to the new election bylaws, “In order to be 
considered, complaints must be filed within two days 
of evidence of the violation emerging to the complain-
ant. Only a unanimous consensus of the Election 

No Higher Court
A.S. Council’s newly created Election Appeals Board is an attempt at efficiency, but will 

ultimately slow down the wait for election results.

“No great victories are won in a war for trans-
formation…without total participation. Less than 
this will not create a new society; it will only 
evoke more sophisticated token amelioration,” 
Martin Luther King, Jr. said.

Two years ago this Sunday on February 26, 
2010, a noose was found hanging in Geisel Library.  
The incident followed hard upon demonstrations 
in which UCSD students demanded a radical 
alteration of existing campus structures and a total 
renewal of the hostile climate those structures had 
produced.

Who made the noose and who decided to place 
it at the edge of a bookshelf matters little now.  The 
noose was really nothing more than a symbolic 
reminder of two seemingly unrelated historical 
facts — the brutal history of terror waged against 
communities of color in the United States and 50 
years of exclusionary policies at the University of 
California, San Diego, and the resultant establish-
ment of an unsympathetic environment for histori-
cally underrepresented groups.

From the “Cookout” to the noose and every-
thing in between, it was clear that administrators 
were not equipped to respond.  To be fair, many of 
them were appalled as the various incidents unfold-
ed.  From within their self-enclosed bubble, others 

asked why students were so angry or worried about 
the negative publicity. Student activists themselves 
were forced to outline needed reforms. 

On March 4, an agreement was signed with 
students but it appeared that too many administra-
tors had mistaken the paper agreement itself as 
the realization of meaningful institutional change. 
The moment the heat of the struggle subsided it 
was back to business as usual. Follow-up was weak 
and a handful of students and their faculty allies 
had to pick up the slack.  Do-nothing councils and 
task forces were established.  Administrators were 
uneasy with student discontent “but unwilling yet to 
pay a significant price to eradicate it.” Structural and 
cultural change “at the deepest level had but few 
stalwart champions.”

A few days ago, the UCSD public relations 
machine spun out a sophisticated repackaging of 
the events that marked Winter 2010.  With the self-
congratulatory title “Commemoration of Activism 
that Transformed UC San Diego,” the photo essay 
celebrates the many “successes” of the last two 
years and claims that the campus is on a new path.  
Smiling faces all around erase the real pain students 
felt at the time, appropriate the labor they expended 
to convert that pain into action, and in the end mis-
represent the history of that brief period in order to 
enhance the university brand.

In the midst of the happy talk, lethal doses of 
Triton spirit, the debate about Division-I sports, 

and other distractions, the campus community 
must take seriously the epigraph from Dr. King and 
ask the following question: “Have we witnessed a 
fundamental rethinking of governing structures and 
policies or have we been presented with little more 
than sophisticated token amelioration?” “Loose and 
easy language” about transformation “falls pleas-
antly on the ear,” but for students, staff and faculty 
who are awake “there is a credibility gap” that has 
yet to be overcome.

Two years gone and the implementation of key 
reforms has been marred by false starts, delays 
and a lack of coherent planning.  Turnover in the 
Chancellor’s office and bureaucratic indolence have 
slowed the process further.  Meanwhile, rising costs 
and questionable decisions on the admissions front 
in the near future will jeopardize recent (minimal) 
increases in the number of African-American and 
Chicano/Latino students on campus.  The only 
“transformation” underway is the conversion of 
a California public university into a semi-private 
corporation committed to the commercialization of 
knowledge from behind a Disneyland-like facade.

The student activists who fought back two 
years ago left us a legacy of commitment out of 
which “monuments of dignity were shaped, cour-
age was forged and hope took concrete form.”  
Despite what some assert today, the struggle those 
students inherited and chose to carry on is far 
from over.

GUEST COMMENTARY

Two Years Later, UCSD Still Has Much to Learn from Student Struggles



THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Committee may overturn this for the 
purpose of upholding a fair election” 
— a fair barrier against last-minute 
grievances like those that occurred 
last year. 

Not that grievances ever make a 
difference in the election results. The 
only significant grievance in recent 
A.S. history occurred during the 
2003 elections, when Vice President 
Internal candidate Steve York filed 
a grievance against a Students First! 
slate. York claimed the slate had vio-
lated election protocol by displaying 
campaign posters on April 10, instead 
of taking them down the night before. 
The committee — and later the judi-
cial board — then disqualified the 
entire Students First! slate.

Such times validate every slate’s 
right to file grievances, even if they’re 
often unnecessary and slow down the 
election process. 

Admittedly, the creation of the 
Appeals Board signals an effort to 
move A.S. Council toward efficiency 
— dividing the J-Board’s initial power 

— though it may actually do the 
opposite when put into action during 
the coming election. 

Just think of the J-Board as the 
Supreme Court of A.S. Council. 
There’s not another court in the 
United States to appeal the Supreme 
Court — it’s “supreme,” after all. Thus, 
if the J-Board is to have any similar 
authority over A.S. Council and the 
electoral process, there shouldn’t be 
another board threatening to over-
power it. A.S. should then remove the 
Election Appeals Board entirely and 
add a fourth section under Article 
VII in the Constitution, which would 
clarify that the Judicial Board has 
the authority to make the final deci-
sion unless detailed evidence proving 
impartiality is presented.

Dear Editor,
Hillary Clinton, the U.S. 

secretary of state, said that China’s 
UN Security Council veto was a 
“travesty.” 

The People’s Daily said western 
campaigns in Libya, Afghanistan 
and Iraq showed the error of forced 
regime change.“The situation in 
Syria continues to deteriorate and 
numbers of civilian casualties keep 
rising. Vetoing the draft security 
council resolution does not mean 
we are giving free rein to letting 
this heart-rending state of affairs 
continue,” the paper said.

China, unlike its western critics, 
was acting “responsibly” for the 
sake of the Syrian people, according 
to the paper. The author used the 
penname Zhong Sheng, which can 
mean “voice of China” and is often 
used on articles giving Beijing’s 
position on foreign policy. 

China’s vice-president, Xi 
Jinping, is visiting the U.S. this 
week and the Syria veto is being 
sparred over. Xi is the Communist 
Party’s likely next top leader. Beijing 
and Washington have also sparred 
over Iran, which faces tightened 
western sanctions over its nuclear 
ambitions. China buys one-third 
of Iran’s oil, ccand refines some of 
it and returns it to Iran as gasoline. 
The People’s Daily commentary 
laid bare broader Chinese concerns 
about western-backed intervention 
in the Arab world and beyond. 
China is one of the five permanent 
UN Security Council members that 
hold the power to veto resolutions.

In March, China abstained 
from a council vote that authorized 
western military intervention in 
Libya. That resolution became the 

basis for a NATO air campaign that 
led to the overthrow of Muammar 
Gaddafi. Beijing and Moscow 
regarded the campaign as going 
beyond the resolution. 

“NATO abused the security 
council resolution about establishing 
a no-fly zone and directly provided 
firepower assistance to one side in 
the Libyan war,” the paper said.

The designation of Libya as 
“a state sponsor of terrorism” was 
rescinded by the Department of 
State on June 30, 2006. According 
to a compilation of the U.S. State 
Department “Countries of the 
World” report of 2012, “there have 
been no instances in which U.S. 
facilities or citizens in Libya have 
been targets of terrorist attacks.”  

“The right of a nation to kill a 
tyrant, in case of necessity, can no 
more be doubted, than to hang a 
robber, or kill a flea,” as John Adams, 
wrote.  “But killing one tyrant only 
makes way for worse, unless the 
people have sense, spirit and honesty 
enough to establish and support a 
constitution guarded at all points 
against the tyranny of the one, the 
few and the many.” 

It staggers me that a foremost 
principle of 20th century U.S. 
foreign policy — which is to keep 
Russia and China apart — has been 
left by the wayside.

THE HIATUS GUIDE TO THE 84TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS

“Midnight in Paris” might not be Woody Allen’s 
best movie, or even the best movie he’s made recently 
(2005’s outstanding “Match Point” comes to mind), 
but its charming sentimentality and clean, bright 
visual style make it one of the year’s best comedies. 
Featuring Owen Wilson (playing a typical Woody 
Allen-replacement narrator) carousing through the 
centuries alongside artistic luminaries like Ernest 
Hemingway, Salvador Dalí and Gertrude Stein, 
“Midnight in Paris” provides the perfect opportu-
nity for Allen to craft a nostalgia-bathed love letter 
to a great city, much as he did with his 1979 classic 
“Manhattan.” 

Though it’s no “Manhattan,” “Midnight in Paris” 
manages to enchant the viewer with its gleefully ludi-
crous plot while maintaining that effortless sense of 
wistful romanticism characteristic of Woody Allen’s 
best films.

“MIDNIGHT IN PARIS”
Like all semi-reclusive artists with distinctive 

style, Terrence Malick has made himself the dark 
horse candidate in this year’s Oscar running with 
his brilliantly subdued “Tree of Life.” Critics divided 
over Malick’s use of ultra-minimal dialogue (echo-
ing his last film, 2005’s Pocahontas revamp “The 
New World”), his granting most of the film’s feel 
to “Children of Men” cinematographer Emmanuel 
Lubezki and his Kubrickian scope (yes, there are 
dinosaurs in this film).

But the fact of the matter is, in all its beautiful 
flaws and expansive grandeur, “The Tree of Life” is 
undeniably the work of one of cinema’s few modern 
masters. From the meditative long cuts of the capable 
child actors, to the visually stunning finale, Malick 
has delivered a piece of art that is both contemporary 
and achingly nostalgic, an enlightening study of the 
nuances of brotherhood and loss and one of the best 
films of the year.

“TREE OF LIFE”

After his deeply embarrassing “Indiana Jones” 
sequel, Spielberg triumphantly surges back with this 
heart-wrenching epic. The noble stallion, Joey, at 
the heart of “War Horse” makes for a compelling 
character any man, woman or child can identify 
with — no dialogue required. Thrown into a war 
he cannot understand, he survives through his 
quick decisions, the kindness of others and sheer 
luck (though many humans in the film can’t say the 
same). 

The cinematography is astounding, capturing the 
(PG-13) hell of war with painterly perfection, and 
John Williams contributes another stirring score to 
tie it all together. Adapted from a book told from 
the horse’s perspective, Spielberg does an admirable 
job of building the supporting characters, but wisely 
chooses to keep the focus on the horse, like a good 
‘ol pre-Pixar family flick from your childhood.

“WAR HORSE”

“The Descendants” got stuck with a lot of associa-
tions — the paradise of Hawaii, the charm of George 
Clooney, the bitter filmography of director Alexander 
Payne (“About Schmidt,” “Sideways”) — but the film 
succeeds at surpassing its familiar parts, turning Hawaii 
into a miserable tourist trap, Clooney into a schluby 
workaholic and Payne into an honest sentimentalist. 

Clooney plays Honolulu lawyer Matt King, the self-
proclaimed “back-up parent” to two daughters. When 
his wife Elizabeth gets into a water skiing accident that 
puts her into a coma, however, he has to grapple with 
his own grief and the sudden responsibility of being the 
only full-time parent.

Mixed with a bit of Payne’s trademark dry humor, 
the plot may scream “dramedy,” but thankfully, it has 
none of the associated melodrama; it’s just a drama that 
revels in the laughs that often come with unfortunate 
situations, held together by flawless performances by 
the entire cast (Clooney in particular).

—ARIELLE SALLAI
Managing Editor

“THE DESCENDANTS”

Scott Rudin’s successful film adaptation of 
Jonathan Safran Foer’s  “Extremely Loud and 
Incredibly Close” is a realistic account of one child’s 
life after losing his father (Tom Hanks) in 9/11. 
Oskar  — played by capable first-time actor Thomas 
Horn — is an elementary-aged child whose social 
anxiety peaks when he discovers a mysterious key 
left behind by his father. 

Many of the movie’s manic scenes of chaotic 
sound, images and emotions leave the audience feel-
ing as overwhelmed as Oskar is. And though this is 
Horn’s debut role, he carries the film entirely with 
his idiosyncrasies and drive to do anything he can 
to hold on to his father for just a little longer. The 
audience is left in tears for much of the movie as 
flashbacks show the depth of Oskar’s fleeting rela-
tionship with his Dad, which ultimately brings him 
closer to the other characters in the film who were 
previously ignored. But despite its hypersensitive 
subject matter, “Extremely Loud” manages to dodge 
preachy American hoorah in the name of compli-
cated human characters and one beautifully crafted 
story.

—LAIRA MARTIN
Staff Writer

“EXTREMELY LOUD AND 
INCREDIBLY CLOSE”

“It’s Neverland and Oz and Treasure Island all 
wrapped into one,” says the wide-eyed young Isabelle in 
Martin Scorsese’s latest 3D children’s adventure “Hugo.” 
For the film, based on the popular book by Brian 
Selznick, the description isn’t too far off. Bursting at the 
seams with whimsical characters and Scorcese’s spar-
kling, sepia-tinged 1930s Paris, “Hugo” has the makings 
of a timeless family classic.  

What’s truly astonishing about “Hugo” is it how it 
seems to so effortlessly operate on two distinct levels: a 
breathtaking action-fantasy following an orphaned boy’s 
quest to unlock the secret of his inventor father’s quirky 
creations (think “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close” 
but with more magic and adventure) and a humble 
homage to influential filmmaker Georges Melies and 
the unbridled creativity of early cinema (think “The 
Artist” but with more magic and adventure). “Hugo” 
has it all — a charming and completely inventive con-
tender for the coveted best picture slot.

“HUGO”

Despite the fact that “The Help” fulfills the 
annual feel-good-film-that-makes-white-people-
think-racism-is-over à la 2009’s cringe-inducing 
“The Blindside,” superb acting, a fantastic 
soundtrack and a grounded, realistic screenplay all 
make “The Help” a Best Picture shoe-in.

Based on the best-selling novel by Kathryn 
Stockett, “The Help” follows a young white woman 
nicknamed Skeeter (Emma Stone) as she inter-
views two black women (played by Viola Davis and 
Octavia Spencer) about their work as maids for 
white families in Jackson, Mississippi during the 
early 1960’s.

Though fictional, the story gives a fresh perspec-
tive on an already well-documented era, providing 
a fascinating, non-preachy voice to a faction of 
women largely unheard. But what gives this film so 
much heart is the strong emotion seeping from the 
eyes and expressions of Aibileen (Davis) and Minny 
(Spencer), the two maids that are forced to comply 
with an overtly racist society, until they can’t keep 
quiet anymore.

— AMANDA MARTINEK

“THE HELP”

“Moneyball” — the second of author Michael 
Lewis’ cult books to turn summer blockbuster— owes 
much to screenwriters Steven Zailian (“Schindler’s 
List”) and Aaron Sorkin’s (“The West Wing”) adapta-
tion. The film, which can only be loosely described as 
a sports movie, has Oakland General Manager Billy 
Beane (Brad Pitt) struggling to find peace with his 
fractured family while bucking old order rules for 
running a small market franchise.

Zailian and Sorkin succeed in keeping with the 
tone of the book, striking a balance between classic 
underdog elements and documentary-like realism, 
executed flawlessly by the strong performances of Pitt, 
Philip Seymour Hoffman and comic relief Jonah Hill.

To be fair, “Moneyball” is unlikely to walk away 
with Best Picture this Sunday, but the film should 
be lauded for its success in combining the usually 
oxymoronic elements of sports movie with good sto-
rytelling.

THE HIATUS GUIDE TO THE 84TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS
BEST ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE

When determining who should receive the best actor award, the Academy 
took some Hollywood names like George Clooney and Brad Pitt, while admi-
rably considering the brave performances from lesser names Gary Oldman 
(best known for his 1986 portrayal of Sid Vicious in “Sid and Nancy”) and 
Jean Dujardin (lead man in France’s “OSS” spy parody franchise, which 
earned him the title of “France’s George Clooney”). Right away, one can 
toss Pitt’s name out solely because he didn’t receive this nomination for his 
subtle yet strong role as the father figure in Malick’s “Tree of Life” — a role 
that easily surpassed his enjoyable yet somewhat conventional appearance in 
“Moneyball.”  And though Clooney puts out yet another solid performance in 
“The Descendants,” his French counterpart Dujardin stole his limelight along 
with everyone else’s, delivering a gripping homage to silent film greats like 
Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino.  His attention to detail is outstand-
ing, considering the limits of the silent, black-and-white medium.

DEMIAN BICHIR - “A BETTER LIFE”
GEORGE CLOONEY - “THE DESCENDANTS”
JEAN DUJARDIN - “THE ARTIST”
GARY OLDMAN - “TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY”
BRAD PITT - “MONEYBALL”

BEST DIRECTOR

MICHEL HAZANAVICIUS - “THE ARTIST”
ALEXANDER PAYNE - “THE DESCENDANTS”
MARTIN SCORSESE - “HUGO”
WOODY ALLEN - “MIDNIGHT IN PARIS”
TERRENCE MALICK - “TREE OF LIFE”

With nominations full of big names and well-known faces such as 
Alexander Payne, Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, the Academy 
has its hands full choosing a winner.  However, this year, two directors 
exceeded many expectations and blew away the rest of the nominees.  
Malick’s “The Tree of Life” is full of wondrous, slow-moving handheld 
shots that place the viewer squarely in children’s point of view. With 
each expert choice made, Malick pours mass amounts of emotion and 
nostalgia down the viewers’ throats to gorgeous effect.  

But Michel Hazanavicius’s “The Artist” proved to be even more 
powerful than Malick’s reminiscing. A flawless tribute to the inspir-
ing films of Hollywood’s past, “The Artist” reminds us that cinema is 
simply a moving image, not some immersive 3D experience that masks 
the lack of creativity that is dragging Hollywood under.

  
—TANNER COOK

Staff Writer

BEST ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE

GLENN CLOSE - “ALBERT NOBBS”
VIOLA DAVIS - “THE HELP”
ROONEY MARA - “THE GIRL WITH THE 
DRAGON TATTOO”
MERYL STREEP - “THE IRON LADY”
MICHELLE WILLIAMS - “MY WEEK WITH 
MARILYN”

There were plenty of commendable performances from lead 
actresses this year — Rooney Mara’s astonishingly raw embodi-
ment of kick-ass antihero Lisbeth Salander, Glenn Close’s convinc-
ing, albeit slightly perturbing, role in “Albert Nobbs,” the surpris-
ingly believable Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe — but the 
true shocker was “The Help”’s Viola Davis as the conflicted black 
nanny Aibilene living in white-dominated 1960s Mississippi. 

Davis’ performance is one of constant inner-strife (picking up 
where she left off with her haunting presence in 2008’s “Doubt,” a 
role that landed her a well-deserved supporting actress nomina-
tion). Aibilene’s obvious love for the white child that she looks 
after beams in every gentle word and smile, while the torturous 
implications of her servitude and social invisibility lingers beneath 
her defeated eyes and chiseled face. It’s a brave, nuanced perfor-
mance in an otherwise stale crowd-pleaser, and it’s more than 
enough reason to remember the name of 2012’s break-out star.

You might have noticed that two of this year’s nominees for 
the hotly-contested Best Original Score category are composi-
tions by Hollywood cinema music grandmaster John Williams. 
Though Williams’ scores for War Horse and The Adventures of 
Tintin are surely replete with the kind of (admittedly generally 
successful) neo-romantic atmospherics that have made Williams 
the titan he is, the decision to include him twice seems par-
ticularly superfluous considering the omission of Trent Reznor 
and Atticus Ross’ brilliantly realized score for The Girl with the 
Dragon Tattoo. Combining minor-key ambient drift, densely 
layered gamelan, and the occasional burst of pure noise, the 
duo’s score provides the perfect counterpart to The Girl with the 
Dragon Tattoo’s stark, unforgiving atmosphere. Furthermore, 
the score, with its polyrhythmic bell experiments and gently 
abrasive melodies, manages to sound compelling in a way that 
major film soundtracks rarely do. Though the Academy’s prefer-
ence for safety over innovation should come as no surprise, in 
omitting Reznor and Ross’ score, they’ve failed to acknowledge 
one of the most fascinating, creative film scores to emerge 
recently.

—ANDREW WHITWORTH
Staff Writer

The omission of Cannes favorite “Drive” in the Best 
Picture nominees shouldn’t have come as a surprise, con-
sidering the slick L.A. noir is too bloody and too edgy for 
the typically traditional Academy. But the inclusion of the 
mediocre “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close” comes 
as a slap in the face to fans of the skull-stomping Ryan 
Gosling flick. Anchored by a cool synth soundtrack and 
a confident Ryan Gosling — a perfect, near mute lead-
ing man — “Drive” harkens back to action movie classics, 

while adding Swedish director Nicolas Winding Refn’s 
romantic, Scandinavian touch to give the film a modern 
edge. But not only did the Academy fail to acknowledge 
such thrilling filmmaking, but also the terrifying (and 
out-of-character) performance by Albert Brooks as a fierce 
mobster — and that’s the biggest mistake of all.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

As per usual Gaito — recently named 
the CCAA pitcher of the week — logged 
another stellar performance, allowing 
just two hits and no runs.

UCSD slowly ran up the score 
against the Warriors, recording one run 
in the first and third innings respec-
tively. The Tritons put Stanislaus back 
two more runs in the fourth inning off of 
a Willmon triple. Scoring another run in 
the fifth inning, a three-run third inning 
off two Warrior errors ended the game 
with the Tritons up 8–0.

GAME 4
UCSD VS CSU STANISLAUS 2-1

Lesovsky homered in her first at-bat 
in the series finale against the Warriors 
on Saturday, to give UCSD the early lead.
 UCSD doubled its lead in the fourth 
inning when freshman Maria Sykes hit 
a big double to left centerfield. Excluded 
from the first three games of the 

series, power-hitter sophomore Charly 
Swanberg made a statement, singling to 
centerfield to bring Sykes into score.

In her five innings, freshman pitcher 
Michelle Escamilla allowed just one hit. 
But in the top of the sixth, with two men 
on base, Gerckens brought in Gaito to 
close. The Warriors’ Sarah Locarnini 
doubled down the left field line for one 
RBI.

The Tritons maintained their slight 
one run lead as Gaito retired the next 
three Warrior batters in order.

GAME 1 
UCSD VS CAL BAPTIST 0-5

The Tritons’ series against Cal Baptist 
matched two All-American arms against 
each other, as Lancer ace senior Emma 
Holden allowed just five hits in seven 
innings.

At the start of the game, Holden 
retired the first three batters in order, 
making way for a two-out homerun 
from Lancer leftfielder Kendall Gorham.

The Lancers pushed the lead out 
to four by in the third inning, logging 
two runs on four hits. UCSD had no 
response as Cal Baptist capped the win, 
scoring another run in the fifth inning.

GAME 2
UCSD VS CAL BAPTIST 0-4

Although UCSD freshman pitch-
ers Hensel and Escamilla teamed up 
to allow just six hits, the Lancers’ Tory 
Ferreira did them one better, logging an 
outstanding 22 strikeouts on just three 
hits.

Like the game before, the game began 
with a three up three down inning for 
the Tritons, while the Lancers answered 
with a solo homerun to go up 1–0. 

Cal Baptist went up 2–0 in the third 
inning, and clinched the win in the 
fourth inning off a two-run homerun 
from centerfielder Marshean August.

season.
After Chico passed on a golden opportunity in the third 

inning, leaving three men on base, the Tritons came up and 
manufactured their first run of the game off a Michaels single 
to left field. Michaels then stole second and was bunted 
over to third by a Liske sacrifice bunt. Big gun Susdorf then 
came up to score Michaels with a triple, deep to center field. 
    Chico catcher Ben Manlove drove a deep one to score Chico’s 
only run of the game as the Wildcats answered the Tritons in the 
fourth inning. 

But Manlove’s efforts were not enough to turn the tide, and 
the Tritons scored single runs again in the fourth and fifth 
innings to put themselves comfortably in the lead 3–1. UCSD 
put more distance between itself and the Wildcats in the seventh, 
when Liske and Levy hit singles and got to second and third to be 
driven in by a Susdorf single. Susdorf and Siegel each had three 
hits on the night.

Pitchers Trevor Scott and Tony York relieved Burns and kept 
the Wildcats off the scoreboard over the last 2.1 innings of play.

The win moves the Tritons to 2–2 in conference play as the 
split the series with No. 10 nationally ranked Chico.

On paper, last weekend’s Triton 
Invitational was a disappointment for 
the UCSD Women’s Water Polo team. 
Hosting the annual tournament for time, 
the Tritons placed 13th out of 16 teams, 
dropping out of the national rankings 
for the first time in 2012. The silver lin-
ing was that the team was victorious in 
its final two matches of the weekend to 
finish the tournament at 2–2.  

And so with renewed confidence, the 
Tritons headed up to CSU Long Beach to 
play the No. 18 49ers in the only match 
of the weekend for both teams. 

The Tritons got off to a quick start 
and sustained their play throughout the 
first half, heading into the break lead-
ing 5–3. 

UCSD struck for four goals in the 
third quarter to go up 9–5, and held on 
in the fourth quarter to win 9–7.

UCSD’s star utility Sarah Lizotte had 
only one goal on the day, a five-meter 
penalty shot in the third quarter. Senior 
driver Katherine Biehle scored three 
of UCSD’s nine goals, matching half of 
her total season output heading into the 
weekend. 

UCSD head coach Brad Kreutzkamp 
was impressed with the senior diver’s 
execution. 

“Katherine Biehle turned in one of 
her best performances as a Triton with 
three goals and a great effort on our 
counter attack,” Kreutzkamp said to the 
athletics department. “I was very proud 
of her effort,”

Sophomore utility Leah Gonzalez 
scored twice for the Tritons while senior 

attacker Jessica Tran tallied three assists. 
With the win, UCSD improves to 

(7–3) overall, while Long Beach falls to 
(2–4).

After falling out of the national 
rankings last weekend, the Tritons have 
rebounded, currently sitting at No. 19 in 
the WWPA poll. 

UCSD hopes to keep the momen-
tum going when they travel to Orange 
County for the UC Irvine Invitational 
this coming Saturday and Sunday. The 
Tritons will open the tournament with a 
bout against No. 1 Stanford. 

The win over Long Beach was UCSD’s 
second over a top-20 opponent. The 
Tritons defeated then No. 20 Colorado 
State in January.

After falling 1–3 in their four-game con-ference opener against No. 15 Chico State last weekend, the Tritons rebound-
ed by sweeping CSU Stanislaus last weekend. 
But the defending NCAA Division-II cham-
pions’ No. 1 national ranking may be in peril 
after the Tritons retained two losses in a non-
conference double header against Cal Baptist 
last Monday, Feb. 20.

   
GAME 1

UCSD VS CSU STANISLAUS 4-1

Experimenting with a new set of starters, 
the Tritons went down early, as Stanislaus’ Kiley 
Mendez reached home on a UCSD error.

In the following three innings, UCSD 
recorded only two hits and failed to convert 
either. The Tritons finally found their way on 
the board in the fifth inning when junior utility 

Annie Heskett and sophomore Kirsten Willmon 
advanced to second and third respectively. With 
just one out, the Warriors elected to walk Triton 
big hitter senior Kris Lesovsky, who leads the 
roster with 24 career homeruns. With bases 
loaded, sophomore Mya Romero, batting in 
the third position, doubled to right center for 
three RBI.

Triton ace, senior pitcher Camille Gaito 
went the distance for UCSD, allowing just one 
run on five hits in her seven innings.

 “[Gaito] did a great job,” UCSD head coach 
Patti Gerckens said. “She always does a great 
job, but she definitely kept them off balance and 
guessing.”

GAME 2
UCSD VS CSU STANISLAUS 5-4

In the second game of the series, UCSD was 
forced to play catch up as Stanislaus’ Lauren 
Liming struck a solo homerun to put the 
Warriors up in the second inning.

UCSD responded in kind in the third inning. 
With two outs and Lesovsky and Romero on 
base, sophomore catcher Caitlin Brown hit her 
second homerun in the young season.

After going up 4–1 in the fourth inning off a 
couple crafty sacrifice bunts, the Tritons seemed 
to let off the gas.

Freshman pitcher Kayla Hensel was relieved 
in favor of junior righthander Jennifer Manuel 
in the fifth. Manuel had a tough inning as the 
Warriors hit the junior up for three runs, after 
which Gerckens put Gaito back on the mound. 
Gaito allowed only one hit in her subsequent 
three innings, but the Tritons also had a difficult 
time in the box.

With the score tied 4–4, the game went into 
extra innings. The Tritons broke the stalemate 
in the bottom of the ninth when Lesovsky was 
intentionally walked. Lesovsky stole second as 
junior third baseman Emily McQuaid grounded 
out, bringing Romero back into the box. With 
two outs, Romero singled down the right field 
line, bringing Lesovsky into score.

“We put some people in that may not 
have had as much opportunity as others and 
they stepped up and I’m very proud of them,” 
Gerckens said. “We had to get back on track. 
The girls know that every game is important, 
and they know that we have to do well and go 
for the win in each one.”

GAME 3
UCSD VS CSU STANISLAUS 8-0

On Saturday, the Tritons took their larg-
est win of the season, ending the game in 
six innings in accordance with the eight-run 
“mercy rule.”

Romero and Brown both had another big 
game, as the sophomores both recorded two 
RBI, while junior Kirsten Willmon — who 
hasn’t seen much time on the field in her sub-
sequent seasons with the Tritons — led UCSD 
with three runs on three at-bats.

GAME 2
UCSD 7,CHICO 6

Last Friday, senior pitcher Jeff Rauh opened 
game one of the CCAA Triton Baseball season 
with a performance similar to last week against 
Colorado Mesa. The righthander gave up two 
runs in the first inning. The Wildcats would 
not need any more the rest of the game, as the 
Tritons scored their only run in the bottom of 
the third inning.

The single run for the Tritons started when 
center fielder Danny Susdorf tripled to right 
field with one out. Fellow outfielder Scott Lisk 
batted him in with a sacrifice fly.

Susdorf had three hits of the Triton’s nine 
on the night leading the team to out-hit the 

Wildcats by three. The four Chico runs were 
all unearned except for a manufactured run 
off a Chico bunt down the first base line.
    The team’s efforts were not well concentrated 
as the Triton hits came few and far between and 
failed to come up in the clutch. 

The Tritons left the bases loaded in the 
bottom of the ninth to end the game.

GAME 2
UCSD 7,CHICO 6

    In the first of Saturday’s games, Chico 
led 4–0 in the third inning before the 
Tritons hit their stride and answered with 
three runs in the bottom of the inning. They 
continued to hit well, and in the seventh 
inning, the Tritons tied the game at four apiece. 
           In the eighth inning, UCSD scored 
again to make the game 6–5, but the Wildcats 

came back with a quick run after closer Elliot 
Tuma hit Chico’s Ryan Beck. Beck would 
advance on two infield ground outs before 
Tuma again struggled with his command and 
let one go behind the batter and past the 
catcher, allowing Beck to tie the game at six.
    The Tritons and the Wildcats went scoreless 
in extra innings all the way into the 13th, 
where the Triton offense picked up again and 
junior catcher James Mossholder singled up 
the middle to leadoff the inning. Shortstop 
Garrett Tuck was then intentionally walked by 
the Wildcats to bring up third-baseman Ryan 
O’Malley, who drew a walk. With the bases 
loaded, bottom of the 13th inning, second 
baseman Sam Michaels stepped up and hit a 
line drive on a laser to center field to bring 
home Mossholder and win the game.

 
GAME 3

UCSD 1,CHICO 15 

The third game of the series was ugly for 
the Tritons. The Wildcats collected 19 hits, 
including two doubles, to the Triton’s four hits.  
       Going into the sixth inning, Chico was up 
9–0, when the Wildcats’ Richard Siegel hit 
a double and was later able to score off an 
O’Malley ground-out. Chico added six more 
runs in the top of the seventh.

Triton starter Greg Selarz took the 
loss, giving up four runs on seven hits. 

GAME 4 
UCSD 5,CHICO 1

Senior pitcher Justin Burns threw an 
impressive 6.2 innings, allowing just one run 
on six hits. Burns had two strike-outs and 
showed good command, hitting only one 
Wildcat player, to pick up his first win on the
