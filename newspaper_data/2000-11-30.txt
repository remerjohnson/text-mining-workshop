Weekend Power Outage 
Interrupts UCSD Plays 
Blown transformer darkens campus during during break 
By KYU BlDUHllMIIi 

. Staff Writer 
A blown transformer at Revelle's Mayer 

Hall cut off the electrical supply to several 
areas of the UCSD campus Sunday after-
noon . 

The power outage occurred just before 4 
p.m. and affected a few buildings in Revelle 
College. Students were largely unaffected by 
the power outage since most went home for the 
Thanksgiving weekend, but performances at 
the La Jolla Playhouse were disturbed by the 
darkness. 

Two simultaneous incidents caused the out-

age. 
First, a transformer at RIMAC caught fire, 

forcing the fire department to close RIMAC for 
the day. Physical Plant Services rerouted elec-
tricity through another substation, restoring 
power and allowing the gym to reopen 
Monday. 

The second incident occurred at Mayer 
Hall when a 12 KVR electrical switch explod-
ed. This incident was thought to be responsi-
ble for knocking out power from Galbraith 
Hall to Scripps Institution of Oceanograghy, 
as well as the La Jolla Playhouse. The fire

UCSD Bows

Lawsuit 
University enforces year-
old federal court order, 
revises posting policy 
By VINCENT GllAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Over a year after agreeing to revise its post-
ing policy, UCSD continued to distribute an 
outdated version of the policy, which states 
that the content of postings in residence halls 
are not permitted to be offensive to any indi-
vidual or group within the university commu-
nity. 

Last week, an e-mail was sent out notifying 
the campus community of the error, and clar-
ifying that the new policy "prohibits UCSD 
officials from engaging in any content-based 
censorship on the basis of the perceived 
offensiveness or discriminatory nature of the 
speech of materials posted on campus." 

In March 1999, the American Civil 
Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the uni-
versity on behalf of Ben Shapiro, a Warren 
student who was ordered by the university to 
remove a sign from his residence hall window 
that stated, "Fuck Netanyahu and Pinochet: 

The university agreed in August 1999 t9. 
rescind all existing policies relating to the dis-
tribution and posting of noncommercial fly-
ers, posters and banners and to replace them 
with policies that prevent university adminis-
trators from censoring the content of these 
postings. The agreement was made in 
response to an order by federal district court 
judgeJohn Rhoades. 

In April 2000, the ACLU learned that the 
old policy was still being distributed, and the 
university promised to take immediate correc-
tive action. 

At the beginning of this academic year, 
Shapiro noticed that the old policy was still 
being distributed on campus. 

He said he was shocked to see the old pol-
icy in this year's student organization hand-
book. 

Director of Student Affairs Nick Aguilar 
said the erroneous dissemination was an

BRIEFLY 
UCSD Awards First ~Chancel1or's Medal' 

Neil Morgan, an associate editor and senior 
cQll.lmnist for the san Oiego Union Tribune, 
received UCSD's First "Chancellor's Medal" 
Tuesday night in a ceremony held at Geisel 
Library. The event was attended by 150 San 
Diego civic and cultural leaders. 

Morgan was honored for his many unique con-
tributions to the city of San Diego during his 
career. Chancellor Dynes spoke at the event, 
calling Morgan "Mr. San Diego," who "has worn 
many hats' including those of "author, civic 
leader, regional booster and critic of the status 
quo.' 

UCSD Associate Chancellor for Extended 
Studies Mary Walshok also spoke at the cere-
mony. She cited Morgan's role in urging UCSD to 
"forge real bonds of trust and mutuality San 
Diego and Tijuana and highlighted the work and 
growth of San Diego Dialogue, the Center for 
U.S./Mexico Relations and the Institute of the 
Americas in the 1990s." 

An exhibition of the .books authored by 
Morgan and memorabilia of his leadership in San 
Diego also opened Tuesday in the Special 
Collections area of the library; it will remain on 
display through December.

In addition, Shapiro noticed that 
the old policy was sent to the San 
Diego Supercomputer Center, 
something Shapiro only noticed 
because he happens to work there. 

jordan Budd, the ACLU attorney 
handling Shapiro's case, sent a letter 
to the University of California, 
demanding that the university 
review everything distributed this 
year that might address posting poli-
cies and certify in writing to the 
ACLU any instances where the old 
policy has been distributed. Budd 
also demanded that the university 
replace all handbooks and docu-
ments containing the outdated poli-
cy with new versions containing the 
new policy, and to notiry the entire 
university community in a hard-
copy format of the errors and 
changes.

on effective visual communica-
tions and gives graphic profes-
sionals the opportunity to learn 
how to apply their experience and 
knowledge to the Web. 

This program differs signifi-
cantly from the current Web 
Publishing certificate, as the focus 
is on visual graphics and multime-
dia rather than on HTML, 
javascripting and technical aspects 
of Web design. The emphasis will 
be on practical, effective applica-
tions and the perspective will be 
toward the graphically inclined 
student or one who desires solid 
Web graphics training. 

Students in the new Web 
design program will focus on 
three primary skill areas: digital 
design, including the principles 
of design, color, typography and 
digital technologies; "what-you-
see-is-what-you-get" Web page 
design and software applications; 
and graphic optimization and 
multimedia on the Web. 

Enrollment is open to the

Christopher Patti, counsel for the 
University of California, responded 
saying that the university wiU com-
ply with Budd's request, except for 
notifying the entire campus com-
munity in hard-copy fonnat of the 
changes. Pani said that the universi-
ty would instead send the notice 
electronically, because hard-copy 
notification is "far slower, less effec-
tive, less likely to actually reach 
members of the university commu-
nity than electronic communication 
and would be unnecessarily costly." 

The university also agreed to a 
request from Budd to pay the ACLU 
$2,500 in legal costs. 

Budd said he finds it inconceiv-
able that the university still has not 
complied with the ruling of a federal 
judge. 

"At best, this conduct on the part 
of the university reflects a striking 
level of incompetence for a world-
class institution of higher education. 
At worst, the university has blatantly 
defied an order from a federal 
court," Budd said. "Either way, it is 
inexcusable."

inland center in Carmel Vallq 
Ranch. 

The UCSD Guardian 

speech ri$hts by failing to infonn the 
commuruty of the court-mandated 
policy revision. 

"Because of the university's fail-
ure to meet its legal obligations, not 
only was the campus community 
given wrong infonnation about the 
First Amendment rights of students. 
but the.university.- and the taxpay-
ers who support it - have also 
unnecessarily paid for work and 
legal costs to correct the problem: 
he said. "Someone should certainly 
be held accountable for this irre-
sponsible behavior." 

Aguilar said the campus struc-
ture makes it difficult to unifonnly 
distribute new policies. 

"It's unfortunate that we had this 
oversight, but in the decen tralized 
structure of UCSD it is not surpris-
ing that one out of hundreds of 
administrators involved in campus 
policy would commit this unfortu-
nate error: he said. "As soon as we 
became aware of this we took 
action." 

, Budd said that while the case is 
near resolution, it will not be entire-
ly resolved until the university certi-
fies to the ACLU its review of all 
campus documents.

In This Election 
Nobody'. a Winner 

With the announcement of the certified 
vote in Florida on Sunday afternoon, Texas 
Gov. George W Bush has been unofficially 
named the president-el~ct of the United 
States. This, however, has not stopped Vice 
President Al Gore from contesting the 
results of tne election on several counts in 
an attempt to have the decision turned in 
his favor. The Guardian believes that it 
would be in the best interest of the Democ-
ratic Party if G0re conceded the election 
now and looked toward the 2004 election. 

Was Gore cheated? Possibly. Did more 
people vote for him than Bush? Definitely. 
Does he, by all rights, deserve to be the next 
president of the United States? Perhaps. 
Despite all this, it would be better for Gore's 
patiy if he conceded now. 

First of all, by conceding, Gore would 
make the Democrats appear that they have 
the best interests of the presidency and 
the country in mind . This would plant a 
seed in the minds of voters that the 
Democratic Party is attempting to do away 
with partisan politics, a problem against 
which the population claims to b,e 
rebelling. With this thought entrenched in 
their minds, the voters would be much 
more likely to elect a Democratic presi-
dent in four years. 

Second, winning this election is not 
much of a prize anymore. Whoever does 
win will be labeled a phony or counterfeit 
president and will likely not be given the 
support and power that the office normally 
earns. After four years of a weak Republican 
president, the nation will likely vote in a 
Democrat next election, whereas if Gore did 
happen to win, he would stifle the candida-
cies of many qualified Democrats in 2004 
and almost ensure that the next president is 
Republican. At this point, it is almost cer-
tain that Democrats like Hillary Clinton and 
Dick Gephardt are holding out for a Gore 
concession. 

A Gore loss would also put Joseph 
Lieberman back in the Congress for six 
more years as a senator from "Connecticut. 
In a Senate that will most likely be split '50-
SO, the loss of Lieberman to the vice presi-
dency could be catastrophic for the Senate 
Democrats by giving the Republicans the 
slight majority. 

Gore may have something to gain by con-
testing the results in Florida, but the Guardian 
feels he would be better serving his party if he 
simply conceded the race and cut his losses. 
This election is obviously a very disappoint-
ing one for the Democratic Party, one that 
they felt they should win because of the 
strength of the economy and President Bill 
Clinton's two-term legacy. Despite how 
much it will hurt to lose the election, it is bet-
ter to forfeit it now then to go on contesting 
it and further alienate the American people.

Thumbs up to four weeks of win-
ter break. It's still not enough

Â·President Clinton's ~egacy is a Mixed 
One, Both Good And Bad 

Clinton's desire to bring peace to warring nations and boost the economy 
helped the United States, but his personal indiscretions tarnished it as well 

By TOM W 
Opinion Editor 

The excitement of Election Day has 
come and gone and all the controversy 
surrounding the selection of the next 
president is finally coming to an end, so 
slow down and catch your breath . 

At last, the consequences of what 
transpired Nov. 7 and in the weeks that 
followed can be fully analyzed. We now 
know who won which elections and can 
debate about . what their victories will 
mean when they take office. 

On the other hand, I have decided 
not to do that. I will not write about my 
thoughts on the new president, the 
"chad," Florida or any of that. I even 
promise not to mention the new presi-
dent's name. 

Instead, I will focus on the outgoing 
president and what transpired over the 
past eigh t years. and perhaps give you a 
new take on his presidency. 

Love him or hate him, William Jef-
ferson Clinton, the 42nd president of 
the United States, is nearing the end of 
his second term. Affectionately consid-
ered a "lame duck" by students of polit-
ical science, Clinton has spent the last 
few months of his preSidency out of the 
limelight, not able to do much with the 
Congress, as he no longer has any bar-
gaining leverage. 

When the new president is inau- ' 
guarated, exactly eight years will have 
passed from the time of Clinton 's inau-
guration. Looking back, we cannot help 
but wonder what mark Clinton will 
leave for America. 

What single event will a person first 
remember when the name "Clinton" is 
evoked? In other words. what is Clin-
ton's legacy for the American people? 

Most presidents of the 20th century 
carry a legacy. Franklin Roosevelt led us 
through World War (( and left us with 
the New Deal. Lyndon Johnson inter-
grated the country with the Civil Rights 

Act and the Great Society, but tore it in 
half with the Vietnam War. The bitter 
legacy that Richard Nixon left continues 
to affect how Americans view their gov-
ernment. 

Ronald Reagan left Americans a lega-
cy of unfulfilled possibilities, which were 
only realized later in the Clinton admin-
istration. That, and a huge debt. 

George Bush, after the fall of the 
Berlin Wall and the end of communism, 
left Americans with a new sense of 
na tiona I pride. 

What will be Clinton's legacy? 
When con~idering what Clinton has 

and has not accomplished over the past 
eight years, an interesting aspect should

type of self-juxtaposition, not 
only in policies but character 
as well. To determine his 
legacy, both must be 
examined. 
be pointed out. Clinton seems to epito-
mize a type of self-juxtaposition, not 
only in policies but character as well. To 
determine his legacy, both must be 
examined. 

One option that dinton can claim as 
his legacy is the tremendously strong 
economy. Clinton entered the White 
House while the economy was in a reces-
sion. When he leaves office, the country 
will be coming off one of its largest eco-
nomic booms in history. 

The New Economy has made many 
Americans very weatlhy and has 
brought about advancements in tech-
nology. Is it fair to say that we can thank 
Clinton for these wonderful times? 
Unfortunately for him and for Vice 
President AI Gore. both who continu-
ously remind people that the great Â· 

boom was of their doing, it is simply not 
true. 

Many economists agree that the eco-
nomic boom started in the last year of 
Bush 's term, and perhaps even reaches 
back to Reagan 's substantial tax cut. 
Hence. Clinton's legacy cannot and 
should not be equated to the ew 
Economy. 

In reality, a president has very little 
control over how the economy is man-
aged. Even if you believe that no single 
person can manage the economy, the 
president has much less influence than 
most Americans believe he does. He can-
not directly raise taxes to slow growth 
nor cut taxes to stimulate it. 

Perhaps Clinton's best move for the 
economy was the re-appointment of the 
omniscient Alan Greenspan as chairman 
of the federal reserve. Greenspan. along 
with the genius of former Secretary of 
the Treasury Robert Rubin , kept the 
economy going strong. 

Another option for Clinton'S legacy 
wou,ld be foreign affairs. For most of his 
first term, Clinton seemingly fumbled 
through many hotspots, failing in Haiti 
and Somalia. The violence in the Balka-
ns and the United States' confused 
stance on it only further proved Clinton's 
inadequacies in foreign affairs. 

Into his second term, however. Clin-
ton made some very important deci-
sion'S, namely his appointments of 
Madeleine Albright as secretary of state 
and the hard-nosed William Cohen as 
secretary of defense. Thanks to them, 
Clinton's foreign affairs record has been 
tremendous, with successes in helping 
create peace in Northern Ireland and 
Bosnia. 

His greatest foreign affairs accom-
plishment, believe or not, was forging 
the peace between Israel and the Pales-
tine before this latest violence. Not 
since Carter had a president been so

Columnist Fails to Be Hip After Much Effort Author Offers TIps for 
UCSD Freshmen Houseguest inspires author to emulate her style to no avail 
Writer compiles a list of suggestions for 
students to improve college experience 

DIVYA RUNCHAL 

I've always known I would 
never be a part of the "in crowd." 
My physique, my clothes, even my 
dirty, chipped nails suggest I 
would never quite fit in with the 
cool, hip students at UCSD. 

Until now, I was comfortable 
with the fact that I had no idea 
how much a pair of Gucci leather 
boots cost (although I can accu-
rately hypothesize that they prob-
ably cost more than every hair 
removal treatment I've ever had). 
Yet, something - or should I say 
someone - ruined it all. A house-
guest with the exotic name of Aida 
(after Verdi's opera) entered my 
life and threatened to change it 
forever. 

The problem I have with beau-
tiful, energetic and intelligent 
women is that they are extremely 
annoying. The reason is not just 
that they usually get every single 
guy who happens to glance their 
way, but also because they unin-
tentionally (sometimes, at least) 
make me realize how inadequate I 
am as a woman. 

Alright, so I'm jealous. But 
wouldn't you be if you had a 
houseguest who not only hung 
out with Axl Rose a few weeks a&"o 
but also manages to squeeze intO 
tight jeans without one single 
ounce of fat bulging at the creas- _ 
es7 " 

Everyone has an Aida in her 
life. In fact, everyone should have 
one. They're happy, bubbly people 
who also happen to have tons of 
guys running after them at every 
opportunity. Yet, what happens 
when you're not the Aida? What 
happens when you're just a shad-
ow of an Aida? One answer: Wal-
low in your misery. 

Until this New York emigre 
entered my household, I thought I 
was extremely hip. Fine, so I'm not 

Alright, so I'm jealous. 
But wouldn 't you be if

weeks ago but also

single ounce of fat 
bulging at the creases? . 

being totally honest. However, I 
still felt like I had the potential to 
be part of the "hip" crow~, the 
crowd everyone yearns to belong 
to but which requires too much 
time and energy for the average 
person. Nevermind that I'd have 
to lose 15 pounds (although some 
may argue 30), have a flawless face 
(courtesy of a lot of too-expensive 
foundation), and also know the 
difference between a Fendi bag 

and a Prada bag. 
I still believed, one might argue 

vainly; that I had a chance. That 
was until a truly hip guy magnet 
who gets into every L.A . club like 
a hot celebrity entered my abode 
and created my identity crisis. 

Perhaps I'm being immature. 
Aren't college students supposed 
to see beyond the immature 
games high school students play 
to see who is the prettiest.skinni-
est, tallest, etc.? Still, I can't help 
thinking that all of you readers 
have felt inferior to someone 
either on this campus or off at one 
time or another, so therefore I 
excuse myself for making foolish 
comparisons to someone who is 
much "cooler" than me. 

My mother may argue that I'm 
a jealous idiot, although she prob-
ably wouldn't put it in such vulgar 
terms, but I feel like declaring war 
against this 24-year-old, whose 
charm managed to get her into a 
rock star's home, to get free coffee 
at Starbucks (while I suffer and get 
only what I pay for) and to snag 
guys' phone numbers like a spider 
does flies. 

I thought I could learn from 
her and become "hipper: in 
hopes that I too could lure attrac-
tive young men (Fsychos need not 
apply) while stit holding onto a 
shred of dignity. I listened as she 
told me how to play the game 
("Act confident, girls, and don't 
forget to be respectfull") and 
watched in a mirror as she com-
pleted my makeover. 

Voila! I was transformed, tem-

Taking Political ColTectness to the Extreme Clinton: 
President tarnished his 
reputation with scarulaJs 

This surplus, however, is as shaky 
as a house built from a deck of 
cards. It is based entirely on the 
capital gains taxes from the bull 
market. Where the market goes, 
this surplus will follow. 

Author laments society's desire to sugar-coat everything 
Iy MAllY ONIiLA !STUDIU 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

With dire determination 
about the nature of his being, an 
annoyingly assertive red M&M 
once said, "I'm not plain, I am 
milk chocolate." I would like to 
meet him, give him a big smack 
upside his candy-coated shell, 
roll my eyes and tell him , "qh 
puhleese!" 

Forgive my insensitivity, but 
when M&M commercials dra-
matica lly echo the complaints of 
present day stereotypes and 
respond to them with such cre-
ative euphemisms, I have but one 
question: Has society become too 
politically correct for its own 
good? 

Believe me, I am as much for 
politically correctness as the 
next person when It comes to 
issues regarding race, gender and 
politics. 

But do WI: really need to sugar 
coat every other word in a con-
versa tion just to avoid sounding 
stereotypical or degrading? 

Take th e case of my high 
school friend Gina, who had 
recently found a job at a local 
ntlde bar. 

We had been talking about 
what she did for a living. 

. ~ por the sake of political cor-
rectness, I'm a not topless bar 
stripper: she smiled. and told me 
ma tter of factly. 

''I'm a male entertainer, thank 
you very much!" 

I thought for a minute. "Urn, 
no," I said. "You're a stripper." I 
si mply rolled my eyes and 
laughed. I sensed she was being 
politically correct for the sake of 
her el!o. 

Somewhat disappointed, and 
embarrassed at the sheer blunt-
ness of flat-out being called a 
"stripper: she shrugged. . 

"Stupid, I know: she replied. 
"I'm a bit overly sensitive about 
that, huh?" Stupid? No. Overly 
sensitive? Maybe. Anal? Unneces-
sarily. Too politically correct for 
her own good? Yes. 

In my opinion, it was fine for 
Gina to sugar coat her not-so-
smiled-upon profession and

avoid criticism or speculation . 

I bet one will agree with me, 
though, when I say it gets old 
when people always want to be 
politically correct about every lit-
tle thing. 

It is simply not necessary, 
because when people use politi-
cally correct terms incessantly to 
avoid sounding shady. they suc-
ceed in accomplishing the very 
opposite . 

Political correctness was born 
sometime in the 1980s as a 
device to curb public figures 
from speaking without inhibition 
and offending minor factions in 
society. 

AlthougH it started only to 
hold public figures to a higher 
standard of professionalism, it 
soon became an unwritten and 
written law in most cOl)1muni-

ties. 
Using political correctness 

was to prevent people from 
being offended, to compel every-
one to avoid using words or 
behavior that may upset homo-
sexuals, women, nonwhites, the 
crippled, the mentally impaired, 
the fat, the ugly or anything not 
in the desirable norm. 

However, political correctness 
has risen to new heights in peo-
ple's consciences when the only 
thing people are concerned about 
is the preservation of others' feel-
ings and egos and the risk of 
sounding too stereotypical. 

What people do not realize is 
that political correctness is an 
ideal, but should not be mandated 
by social norms. 

We should be able to speak as 
plainly as we want without worry-
ing about how we sound, just so 
long as we are genuine and do not 
speak with fighting words. 

If we are judgmental and criti-
cal people to begin with, no polit-
ically correct term will be able to 
mask that. 

Every word, whether describ-
ing a person, a group of people or 
a profession, seemingly has a 
politically correct counterpart. 

Although most of these terms 
are arguably needed to prevent 
prevailing stereotypes, it is easy to 
get carried away. 

Soon we are left with com-
mercials that mock the behavior 
of society and animated candy 
pieces telling us what to call 
them - something that this ver-
tically challenged, Asian-Ameri-
can, Greek-affiliated, academic 
athlete (or: short, sorority, nerdy 
Asian girl) will certainly not 
have.

Despite Clinton's obvious and 
often criticized attempt to base his 
legacy on foreign affairs, he accom-
plished much more with the issues 
at home. 

Clinton again started off on the 
wrong foot with national issues. 

Lastly, one cannot ignore the 
complicated nature of Clinton's 
character nor his constant battle 
with scandal. As mentioned

a duality. Here is a man that was

We can talk all we want about 
peace, but when the core human 
issues of justice and freedom are 
ignored, peace loses its meaning. 
We cannot achieve peace along 
false lines. 

More importantly, the line in 
the article stating, "The 'vigil pri-
marily concentrated on Chris-
tians, Jt;WS and Muslims" is ques-
tionable. If this was the case, then 
why was the event organized at 
the same time that the Muslim 
Student Association held its 
Islamic Awareness event, thus 
making it difficult for me group to 
attend? 

Secondly, the Arab Student 
Union and the American Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee 
were not contacted. If you ask us, 
the planning was shady and casts 
doubt on the intentions of the 
organizers. Moreover, the quoted 
words of Rabbi Goldstein, ,M't is 
important to understand that what 
happens there, happens there, but 
here is our own world" take away 
from the severity of the situation 
and our moral responsibility as 
citizens of the United States and 
human beings on this planet to 
guard against the suffering of 
innocent populations.

Everything that Clinton did, all the

is remembered because of its 
importance to the economy, the 
world and to our sOciety. Even the 
economic boom will be credited, if 
unfairly, to Clinton. 

As mentioned before, all of this 
will culminate to one: single aspect: 
his character. His dueling personal-
ities, coupled with his accomplish-

acter. 

He was a great president 
brought down by his human, car-
nal desires. This will be Clinton's 
legacy: the duality of his accom-
plishments and defeats that reflect-
ed the duality of his nature. 

As promised, I did not mention 
the new president's name. I cannot 
tell you what will happen in the .

~D &. NATION 
Serbs Retake Town Near 
Kosovo and Stir up Old Fears 

LUCANE, Yugoslavia -
Along the deserted road to this 
village, Serbian special police lie in 
the undergrowth, warm them-
selves by a camp fire and stand 
watch under the eaves of a house. 
Lucane marks the front line in a 
growing confrontation with 
Albanian militants who seized 
positions in the .nearby hills last 
week. 

The scene was like many in 
Kosovo last year, of Serbian police 
officers and Albanian rebels 
threateniog each other's posi-
tions, while villagers cowered in 
the middle. 

But this is Serbia proper, sev-
eral miles outside the boundary 
with the province of Kosovo and 
away from a demilitarized buffer 
zone. The encroachment of armed 
Albanians over some months -
particularly the way they routed 
Serbian units last week, killing 
four police officers - has alarmed 
Serbs. It has also presented a chal-
lenge to the new government of 
President Vojislav Kostunica. 

The rebel force, which the 
Serbs say numbers at least 200, is 
an offspring of the Kosovo 

Liberation Army and has vowed to 
bring independence to Albanians 
in towns like Lucane, here in the 
Presevo valley of Serbia. 

On Wednesday the special 
police forces retook control of the 
village, re-establishing a check-
point in the center that they had 
to abandon last week. They met 

"Our forces are not 
going to 'make any 
offensive actions. " 

no resistance. The village is now 
deserted but for a few e1aerty resi-
dents, but by nightfall the police 
were jumpy,. on alert against 
attack. . 

Kostunica, who has been in 
power for just over a month, has 
handled the ais~ with calm. reas-
suring the Serbian and Albanian 
communities in the area and 

'steadying the aggressive talk. of the 
military and the police. 

Yet at the same time, he sent in 

police forces to retake the village, 
which is just a mile from the siz-
able town of Bujanovac. whose 
population of 50,000 is nearly half 
Serbian. 

Novica Zdravkovic, the 
Serbian chief of police of the 
region, played down Wednesday'S 
action, saying the police had 
merely moved their checkpoint 
forward a few hundred meters. 

Â·Our forces are not goin, to 
make any offensive actions. he 
said. ~They are defensive forces 
and they will not react unless 
attacked: 

But backing up his P9lice at 
Lucane are heavily armed 
Serbian military and special 
police forces, w.ho have moved 
tanks, 'artillery and scores of men 
into the region. The special 
police forces were highly visible 
Wednesday, in their Hummer 
armored vehicles. The army has 
ranged tanks along the length of 
the hills, their guns turned west-
ward toward Albanian villages in 
the buffer zone.

Spending Slowdown May Signal 
Economic Boom's End 

NEW YORK - For the last 
decade, even as corporate profits 
have soared, profit growth has 
paled next to the boom in compa-
nies' spending on new computers 
and software, industrial machines 
and buildings. 

With the help of bank loans, 
bonds and a willing stock mar-
ket, companies have bought 
almost $9 trillion worth of 
equipment since 1991, lifting 
productivity an~ sustaini~g t~e 
longest e~onomtc expansIOn In 
American history. 

Now, however, the investment 
explosion is showing broad signs 
of slowing. Corporate profits are 
falling in many industries. giving 
companies less money to spend. 
Banks have tightened their lend-
ing policies, raising the cost of 
money. 

And the swoon of technology 
stocks has forced the very compa-
nies that have made some of the 
most dramatic investments in new 
equipment to reconsider how they 
operate. 

With consumer confidence 
falling at the same time, analysts 
say the moderation in capital 

spending has raised the odds that 
the economy will slow markedly 
next year. Some also see an 
increased risk of recession . 
"We're moving into a different 
phase of economic and financial 
behavior than the one we've been 
in for the last four, five years,Â· 
said Henry Kaufman, the Wall 
Street economist, who sees a 
one-in-three chance of a reces-
sion in 2001. 

In the third quarter, capital 
spending grew at an annualized 
rate of 7.8 percent, about half its 
pace of the previous quarter, the 
government said on Wednesday. 
Many analysts say growth will fall 
below 8 percent next year for the 
first time since 1992. 

Last quarter's slowing helped 
cause the economy to expand at 
just a 2.4 percent annual pace 
between june and September, the 
smallest quarterly bump in four 
years, the Commerce Department 
reported on Wednesday in its re$-
ular revision of gross domestiC 
product data. 

"The slowdown has arrived; 
said jerry Jasinowski, president of 
the National Association of 

Manufacturers. "The remaining 
question is how hard the landing 
will be: 

Since 1993, productivity - the 
amount one worker can produce 
in an hour - has jumped almost 
20 percent in the United States. 
That has allowed the economy to 

~w and incomes to rise without 
tnflation kicking in. 

Conversely, economists say, a 
slowdown in long-term invest-
ments could hamper profits 
immediately and productivity in 
the years ahead. Wages, in turn, 
could stagnate - as they have 
already done in the last 12 months 
- and the stock market could 
continue falling, causin~ con-
sumers to keep their credit cards 
in their pockets. 

Â·You could get a reinforcing 
set of events, and the end of the 
capital spending boom could spell 
the end of th~ expansion; said 
Edward McKelvey, a senior econ-
omist at Goldman Sachs. "That's 
not our view, but it's not an unbe-
lievable story."

Japan: 
50, 000 Chinese were 
taken to Japan 
CGIIIIMed froIa ..... 1 

The agreement could set a 
precedent for dozens of similar 
cases in japan and in the United 
States, where Chinese, Koreans, 
Filipinos and Americans forced to 
work on behalf of the Japanese war 
effort are seeking compensation 
from corporations like Mitsubishi 
and Mitsui. 

Â·This settlement is extremely 
significant, becallse companies 
similarly accused are likely to set 
up similar funds to deal with 
wartime compensation issues.Â· said 
Yoshitaka Takagi, head of a lawyers' 
group that monitors wartime com-
pensation cases. 

Hanaoka gained a place in 
japanese history when laborers 
among the 986 Chinese taken 
there in 1944 rebelled against 
harsh conditions. Four Japanese 
guards and one Chinese worker 
died in an uprising on June 30, 
1945, an action that Japanese 
troops crushed. But a total of 418 
Chinese died at Hanaoka at the 
hands of guards before the revolt 
or as a result of torture aftuward. 

Wednesday's settlement, 

Gore: 
VP knew he could not 
Stop ballot movement 
C." ..... d froIa ..... 1 
submitted to the state's highest 
court early Thutsday, Gore 's 
lawyers said . It essentially asks the 
Supreme Court to take over Gore's 
contest lawsuit from the slow-mov-
ing trial court, to count the ballots 
itself, and eventually to declare 
Gore . the winner if he wins the 
recount. 

But lawyers for Gov. George w. 
Bush said they had no intention of 
allowing any hand counting to 
begin without a vigorous legal 
fight. To that end, they persuaded 
Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to 
order 1.1 million ballots - every 
vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm 
Beach counties - brought up from 
south Florida and placed in the 
court's custody. 

That represents 83 times the 
number of disputed ballots that the 
judge had agreed on Tuesday to 
transport to Tallahassee at the Gore 
team's request. And it could take 
weeks if not months to count them 
all, the point that Barry Richard, 
Bush's chief trial lawyer here, said 
he was trying to make in requesting 
that the ballots be transported here. 

Â·We did it to make a point," 
Richard said in an interview. "If you 
recount any ballots, you have to 

although small by U.S. standards, is 
probably the largest in Japan, where 
laws often limit the compensation 
in legal battles. The accord 
amounts to $4,600 for each 
Chinese worker at Hanaoka. 

Takagi noted that this was the 
first time in japan that compensa-
tion had been awarded for a viola-
tion of international law, specifical-
ly the 1907 Hague Convention 
dealing with slave labor. It is also 
the first time that a Japanese com-
pany has agreed to compensate 
Chinese forced laborers. At least 
three other cases seeking pay for 
forced labor in the war have been 
settled, all involving Koreans. 

Some 50,000 Chinese were 
forcibly taken to Japan in the war, 
and an estimated 10 million 
worked as forced laborers in 
japanese companies in Manchuria 
during Japan's 14-year occupation 
of that northern region of China. 
Up to 10 percent of them died, 
according to Chinese lawyers and 
historians. 

Japanese companies contend 
that they were merely following the 
dictates and policies of the 
japanese government and military 
at the time and could not be held 
responsible.

The NtUJ York TImes 

recount all of them. Now, we don't 
think any ballots should be count-
ed, because the manual recovnt of 
ballots is finished . But in the event 
the court determines that some 
ballots should be counted, we 
wanted them here so they could all 
be counted." 

Aware that they could not stop 
the movement of all the ballots, 
Gore's lawyerS barely objected to 
the move, asking only that the dis-
puted ballots that might contain 
hidden Gore votes be separated 
from the mass. 

"I know when it's futile: sa id 
David Boies, Gore 's chief tria l 
lawyer, to Sauls. 

Nonetheless, Gore's lawyers 
were furious at the move, aware 
that it represents yet another 
enormous barrier to their hopes 
for an immediate count of the 
14,000 disputed ballots in the two 
counties and a quick decision 
from the judge that Â· Gore really 
won the election. Even if the 
Florida Supreme Court should 
swiftly agree.to their request and 
orders the counting to begin by 
Friday, that would still put them . 
three days behind their original 
timetable. And facing a Dec. 12 
deadline for the state to name 
elect?rs for the Electoral College, 
Gore has absolutely no days to 
spare.

0Iphans' School Strays From Intention of Founders, Say Alumni 
HERSHEY, Pa. - CaUing itself 

a "ragtag armyÂ· of orphans, the 
alumni association of the Milton 
Hershey School is fighting ~ith the 
school's administration over the 
future - and, it says, the soul - of 
the nation's largest, richest 
orphanage. 

Next week, the alumni will meet 
with state Attorney General Mike 
Fisher, who oversees charitable 
trusts, to press him to push the 
school back in the direction its 
founder intended. 

The Hershey school was started 
in 1909 by the chocolate manufac-
turer Milton Hershey and his wife, 

Catherine, for the "maintenance, 
support and education" of poor 
orphan boys. The orphanage 
became the main beneficiary of the 
Hershey fortune, now held in a 
trust worth $4.5 billion. 

Since Milton Hershey's death in 
1945, the trust has yielded an 
embarrassment of riches, which 
now includes almost $800 million 
in accumulated income, far more 
than the school needs for its 1,163 
students, who receive free room, 
board, clothes, books. bikes and 
backpacks. 

In a 60-page report this 
October, the alumni association 

charged the school's board with a 
history of conflicts of interest, mis-
use of money and a steady retreat 
from the single-minded commit-
ment to the neediest children that 
Milton Hershey intended. 

William Lepley, the president of 
the school , said the school 
responded by hiring former U.S. 
Attorney General Dick 
Thornbu'rgh to look into the alum-
ni allegations, and that he had 
found no illegalities. 

The Hershey school has 
changed enormously since -the 
trust was set up to care for poor 
white boys whose fathers had died. 

The trust has been amended sever-
al times, to include children whose 
mothers are dead, those of any race 
and those of both sexes. 

In 1976, the school expanded its 
definition of orphan to include 
"social orphans," needy children of 
single or divorced parents. Today, 
only one in 10 students has a par-
ent who is dead, and most students 
spend time with their families. 

The concept of neediness has 
been expanded, too. The school 
now takes children from families 
with incomes up to 150 percent of 
the federal poverty line, and about 
half the students come from such 

families. 
The alumni charge that the 

Hershey school is becoming a kind 
of prep school for not-quite-poor, 
not-quite-orphaned children. John 
Halbleib, a Chicago lawyer who is 
president-elect of the alumni asso-
ciation and one of five siblings in a 
fam ily of 12 to attend the Hershey 
school after their father's death , 
said: "Now they see it more as a 
kind of boarding school for lower-
middle-class kids. The school does-
n't want to be a surrogate family:

then send the plan back to the e-
university committee for further 
revision. 

Greg Osburn, a documentation 
specialist for Academic Computing 
and Information Technology 
Services, said the policy is prema-
ture for the university because 
some faculty do not use e-mail as 
their primary form of communica-
tion. 

"[ think it's still kind of early to 
create some kind of mandate,W 
Osburn said. "Too many faculty 
don't rely on it or use it enough. It 
would be too easy for people to 
miss important messages." 

Many students, such as unde-
clared freshman Jacqueline Kerr, 
frequently use computer labs. 
While using UT computer labs is 
sufficient for her, Kerr said she 
does not think the proposal should 
apply to everyone. 

"I think people use computers a 
lot and are more likely to get infor-
mation on the computer," she said. 
"'But] I don't think they should 
require everyone to do it that way 
because there arc people who don 't 
have a computer th at would have 
to make extra effort."

7PJ ith over 30 scheduled films this holiday season, Hollywood is oying to make up for what was a poor summer in tenus of film quality. This year's films range from 
towenng mountains to desolate islands. from slapstick 
comedy to serious dramas. While some have the poten-
tial to be great films, others are probably going to be 
clear mil\SeS. Bestdes the usual blockbusters. December 
will be tilled with Hollywood and independent films 
alike contending for Oscars. Here is a look at some of 
the more anticipated films in store for this season; 

v.rtIceI LInIIt 
Dec. 8 
Starring: Chris O'Donnell, Bill Paxton, Robin Tun-

ney, Scott Glenn,lzabeUa Scorupco, Temuera Morrison 
and Stuan Wilson. 

A climber, Peter Garrett (O'Donnell), must make .. 
treaCherous climb up K2, the world's second highest 
peak, in order to save his sister, who is stranded on the 
mountain. Garrett must confront his personal prob-
lems arid his sWTOundings before it is too late. 

Outlook: Unfortunately, this film has all the looks 
and feelings of "Cliffhanger: The plot seems that of a 
Weal action/disaster film, one that does not try too 
fuird to get the brain working and that is uninspired. 
O'Donnell's only experience in major actiol' films so far 
cbn,ists of the "BatmanW series, so he is probably not a 
good fit for the role of an extreme mountain climber. 

1IIe 1IIIIIINf' ..... 8roow 
Dec. 15 
Starring: David Spade, John Goodman. Eanha Kitt 

and Patrick Warbunon. 
This animated film takes place in a mythical moun-

tain kingdom where a JOung, arrogant emperor named 
Kuzco (Â¥Oiced ~ Spade) is transformed into a llama by 
one of his adVlSCl'S. Kuzco's only hope of returning 
home lie5 with a good-natumi peasant named Pacha_ 
Kuzco be!tins thl: advmture back to his kin~om while. '. 
rQli%ing the et1'OI'5 of his previous ways of life. 

Outlook.: With a low budgl:t, "The Emperor's New 
Groove" is more of a second-rate project than the usual 
quality films made by Disnqs animators. Wtth both a 
weak script and lack of major star power, this film will 
do only somewhat well, and only ~cause the name = is attachtd to the project. The movie will only

them to make up with the girls and to find their car. 

Outlook.: Dude. whae's the brain of whoever made 
this film? Some films are made to ~ instant classics; 
this is not one of them. The idea of teen-in-trouble,

in the pursuit of not a car, but money.

'Horns Wings and More Tales' 
By RAHlJA SAM 
Special to the Guardian 

"Performance an ... that usually involves 
getting naked and smearing stuff on your body, 
right?" a student queried earlier this week, 
looking at the postcard ad for "Horns Wings 
and More Tales." The ad featured a black and 
white photo of a dancer superimposed on an 
attention-getting red background. 1J-ut: to the 
title, the dancers appear at various moments in 
the program with wings, homs and even (yes) 
their tails bare as they artfully spin a tale of the 
female experience in our culture. 

The Lower Left dance company has 
reprised the popular "Horns Wings and 
Tales," a powerful mish-mash of dance and 
performance art first performed in 1998. 
"Horns Wings and More Tales" opens 
tonight with "Moving Violations" for a seven-
night, two-weekend run at Sushi Visual and 
Performance Art Space downtown. 

The show presents a series of subtly relat-
ed vignettes featuring such characters as 
Hairy Woman, Monster Girl and Nordstrom 
Woman. Through monologu.es and move-
ment. the five performers bring to light the 
ways in which American women chafe under, 
cope with , and (somewhat) escape from the 
inherent patriarchy of our culture. The 
women of Lower Left are not afraid to be 
both poetic and aggressive, and they present a 
stunning piece of work. 

Between mud, water, spelunking equip-
ment, flying harnesses, crazy-but-Iogical mono-
logues, glue-on body hair, c:nd ofCourse dance, 
this show covers vulgarity, beauty. anger, 
repressed pain and hope. Something for every-

one? Not for those who seek to avoid chal-
lenges to the status quo. Viewers of previous 
performances have been heard uttering phrases 
such as "Iife-dlanging" and "phenomenaL" 

Opening the evening is a dance crazy with 
movement called "Moving Violations." First . 
choreographed by ina Martin of Lower Left 
in the mid-eighties, it was revived for this 
year's Trolley Dances and expanded for this 
performance. In addition to learning Martin 's 
choreography, the dancers worked together 
under her direction to create the fastest, most 
hair-raising quintets they could, crammed to 
capacity with lifts, jumps, flailing limbs and 
half-controlled falls. 

Numerous UCSD dancers and alumni are 
performing in the show. Alumna and UCSD 
Recreation gymnastics instructor Margaret 
Paek will be seen in both pieces. Also, over a 
third of the huge cast of "Moving Violations" 
comes from UCSD. Look for undergraduate 
Lindsay Sworski, graduate student Jean Stein-
er and alumni Todd Bennett, Jean Dugan, 
Hannah Griffith and Andrew Wass. Such a 
strong UCS D presence in the post-modern 
dance community is noteworthy, especially 
considering that the dance department .here 
tends more toward the modern dance vein. 

With seven performances in two weekends, 
UCSD students have no excuses for not going 
to "Horns Wings and More Tales." This may 
be a crazy time, between finals and getting 
home for vacation, but so what - you'd regret 
missing this amazing perfonnance. 

Sushi is located on 11 th Avenue, between) and K 
streets. TICkets for "Horns Wings and More Tales" are 
$15, $12 for students and $10 for Sushi members.

An open .Ietter 
to UCSD Chancellor Robert C. Â·Dynes 

from UPTE-CWA 
Dear Chancellor Robert C. Dynes, 

As you know, UCSO's researchers, health care professionals and technical employees have receiv~ raises that 
amount to less than inflation over each of the last 3 years. As a result, our wages now lag 25% behind our counterparts 
outside of UC. You and the other chancellors, meanwhile, have received raises averaging 32% (or $67,300) between 
1996 and 1999. 

This policy of underpaying employees has led to turnover rates of up to 30%. UC has become ~ traini~g ground for 
employees on their way to a "real" job. This means we will no longer be able to attract the best and brightest In order ~o 
keep UC the great university we have all built. . ' . . 

We were pleased to hear that President Atkinson and many chancellors now admit that UC has underpaid Its 
employees and not treated us with the respect that our dedication deserves. While these words are an improvement over 
the denials of a year ago, we have yet to see these statements translated into reality. 

Since we keep receiving the same old proposals from UC at the bargaining table, we are beginning to suspect that 
your new found sympathy with staff may be insincere. UC ~as allowed bargaining to extend. once again beyond the usual 
date for our annual pay raises. We believe this is an effort to press~re us to accept smaller IncrElases than we des~rve 
and smaller increases than we know UC can afford. 

Please stop playing games with our livelihoods and bring negotiations to a quick conclusion with fair raises for all. 
Don't wait another day to start supporting us. We want to focus our energies on what we do best: 
providing quality education, research and health care at UC. 

Sincerely, 

UPTE-CWA, 
on behalf of the 10,000 dedicated UC employees we represent

Celebrating the Holidavs South of the Border 
Mexicans have their own way of celebrating during the Christmas season 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Features Editor 

With the holiday season 
approaching, it is important to 
realize that not all cultures ring in 
the new year by decorating a dead 
tree and leaving milk and cookies 
for an overweight burglar in a red 
jumpsuit. In fact, our neighbors 
just south of the border have a very 
different way of celebrating Christ-
mas and the new year. 

While Christmas in the United 
States is generally celebrated on 
Dec. 25, the Mexican hOliday cele-
bration stretches from Dec. 16 to 
Jan. 6. It is not uncommon for 
many Mexicans to take the two 
w~eks before Christmas off of work 
or school in order to spend more 
time with family and friends and to 
Celebrate the holiday, according to 
hf!p:llwww. mexonline. com. 

The Posadas are one of the ' IÂ¥s~-k!lown holiday traditions in 
Mexico. There is one held each 
night for the nine nights prior to 
Christmas Eve. While the literal 
translation of "posada" is "home: 
"s~eltern or "inn: the Posadas are

Living in New York City, Jack 
Campbell (Cage) is a man who lives 
the fast life. This changes one morn-
ing when he wakes up to find him-
self with Kate (Leoni), a woman he 
never married, and with two kids he 
never fathered. This alternate life is 
one that Campbell had the opportu-
nity to begin when he was in college. 
but rejected it by rejecting Kate. 
Campbell must make the difficult 
task of adjusting to his new role as a 
loving husband and faIPcr. 

Outlook: "Thc Family Man" is 
shaping out to be a modem "It's A 
Wonderful Life" that adds to the 
endless amount of holiday films. 
With a good script. this film could be 
one of the better films this holiday 
season. The "what if" plot makes this 
film a pleasant, sentimental experi-
ence that will appeal to most but 
may be too sappy for some.

Starring: Sandra Bullock. Ben-

An unpolished and geeky FB~ 
agent, Gracie Hart (Bullock), must 
change not only her looks but also

assignment as a beauty pagcant con-
testant in order to stop a terrorist 
attack. Han must not only endure 
the torturous process of a complete 
makeover, but also ensure safety at 
the beauty pageant. 

Outlook: This film looks like a 
decent comedy, with Bullock playing 
the role of an ugly ducking that 
becomes a beautiful woman. With 
the mockery of pageants as a focus 
and Bullock as a star, this movie is 
likely to bring out some laughs from 
what is an otherwise ordinary script.

dramatized re-enactments of Saint 
Joseph and the Virgin Mary's 
search for a place to stay and give 
birth to the baby Jesus. 

In older celebrations of the 
Posadas, a young boy and girl were 
chosen to represent the two bibli-
cal figurtS. In modem celebrations, 
groups of people walk around with 
candles. They visit three houses 
and ask for a place to stay by 
singing a traditional question-and-
response song. The first two hous-
es deny them access, while the 
third house welcomes the group 
inside for festivities. 

When the group is finally wel-
comed into the third house, it gath-
ers around a manger scene and 
offers songs of welcome called Ave 
Marias. 

While the more religious cele-
brators of the Posadas may pray 
when the third house lets them in, 
the event has evolved into a party. 
The festivities usually include 
refreshments and dancing. The 
adults are served a thick punch that 
usually contains a -little alcohol to 
keep out the cold. 

Often, the party also includes a

pinata, which is very popular 
among children. The pinata is filled 
with candy and toys, and is usually 
hung from a tree. 

The celebration is said to have 
originated -in 1587, according to 
the Internet system of the presi-
dency of Mexico, located online at 
http://world.presidencia.gob.mx. 
According to the Web site. it was 
then that Friar Diego de Soria 

UCSD Bookstore 

.-~ 

obtained a Papal Bull from Pope 
Sixtus v to celebrate "Aguinaldo: 
the Christmas gift Masses that ran 
from Dec. 16 through Dec. 24 in 
what was New Spain. 

The Masses, which were held in 
the church atriums and designed to 
convert patrons before Christmas, 
were filled with scenes that alluded 
to Christmas. The Augustinian 
missionaries used fireworks, 
sparklers, Christmas carols and 
pinatas to attract crowds. These 
festive celebrations evolved into the 
modern celebration. 

The ritual is continued until 
Christmas Eve, when another verse 
is added to the Ave Marias that tells 
the Virgin Mary that the night has 
come to give birth to baby Jesus. 
The children are dressed as shep-
herds and stand beside the nativity 
scene while members of the com-
pany kneel and sing. The ritual is 
concluded by rocking the baby 
Jesus to sleep with the cradle song 
"EI Rorro, ~ which means "Babe in 
Arms." 

After the last of the Posadas, 
worshippers go to church to attend 
the "Misa de Gallo" or the "Mass of 

the Rooster." This is the first Mass 
of Christmas Day and is tradition-
ally celebrated with fireworks, ring-
ing bells and. blowing whistles to 
announce the birth of Jesus. 

The Mass is followed by a large 
dinner of traditional Mexican foods, 
including tamales, rice, rellenos, 
atole (a sweet traditional drink) and 
medudo, which is said to be more 
sobering than a strong cup of coffee. 

Celebration of the holiday on 
Christmas Day itself also differs from 
the American celebration. While 
Americans traditionally celebrate the 
clay with a Christmas tree and pre-
sents, Mexicans usually do not do 
anything special on Dec. 25. Howev-
er, recent trends have Mexicans inte-
grating the American celebration of 
Christmas trees and Santa Claus into 
their traditional celebrations. 

In Mexican tradition, presents 
are not distributed until Jan. 6, the 
Dia de Reyes, which means the 
"Day of the Kings." This day, also 
called the Epiphany, is supposed to 
coincide with the twelfth night of 
Christmas. This is the day on 
which it is believed the three wise 
men brought gifts to Jesus.

"Don't let money change ya!" 
proclaimed Blackalicious at their 
show on Nov. 20 at Canes in Mis-
sion Beach. nue to their word, 
they have not. 

Blackalicious released their EP 
in 1999 and followed up with their 
full-length album "Nia" in 2000. In 
the early 1990s, Blackalicious 
helped to establish the under-
ground hip-hop scene in San Fran-
cisco and, even today, continue to 
stay trUe to their origin. Known for 
their funky beats and lyric-induced 
imagery, B1ackalicious are notori-
ous for keeping the crowd perpetu-
ally moving and hyped up. Their 
lyrical skills. fresh originality and 
interaction with the audience made 
this show quite possibly the best 
hip-hop show all year. 

Blackalicious' "Nia" really 
. sttuck a chord in the underground 
with its trUe hip-hop flavor. Gift of 
Gab, the group's forefront lyricist, 
along with producer DJ Chief Xcel, 
have been creating some of the 
most innovative, personal and witty 
lyrics and beats since they staned 
out in. 1994. Gift of Gab's talent is 
stUpendous and is not fully gras-
pable until seen in the flesh .

Contributing Hiatus Writer 

What an amazing show! Call me 
easily entertained. but I never 
would have thought it could be so 
fun to watch a group of people hit 
a variety of household items 
together to make music. The origi-
nal beats and rhythms of each per-
son, done together, produced such 
a unique form of song. It was great 
to witness the interactions of the 
performers, each holding his own 
character, which developed 
throughout the show. 

The assonment of items used as 
instruments made the show fun 
and appealing, while the dancing. 
incorporated with the making of 
the music, made it impossible to 
look away. I was interested and 
astounded from one set to another 
at the skill it takes to do what those 
performers do. 

The show was amusing just to 
watch from the sides. but it was 
made even more entertaining by 
audience interaction. Led by one of 
the performers, the crowd clapped, 
snapped and stomped along during 
pans of the show. It was a nice lit-
tle sample of what hard work it 
must actually be to dance on stage 
and hit a bunch of noise-making 
items at just the right times to fit in 

,with the: beat. I appreciated the 
show so much more when my arms 
and hands cramped up after 10 . 
minutes of snapping along. 

The: show was a breathtaking 
success. Because of its surplus of 
cleverness and creativity, it's one: I 
wouldn't mind seeing again.

mous song "A to G" from the new 
album and finished off with 
"Alphabet Aerobics." These songs 
consist of a plethora of allitera-
tions and tongue twisters. In addi-
tion, the beat gets faster with each 
consecutive letter so that the lyrics 
get so swift that they seemingly 
trip over themselves. However, 
Gab maintains his breath and pro-
nunciation, though the crowd has 
to take a deep breath after this 
performance. His variety in pitch 
and meter is very distinctive, and 
matched with Xcel's vintage beats 
and sampling from the '70s and 
'80s makes a divine combination. 
How Gab manages to go from a 
robotic monotone to a syrupy 
flow to a ghetto drawl with each 
song remains a mystery based in 
his endless talent and repenoire. 

Gab is not the only one with 
shining talent. Gab's partner Me, 
Lateef, has a lyrical style influ-
enced by dancehall. He gave a 
stunning performance, and his 
energy in managing the crowd 
never seemed to cease. H is style of 
rapping and singing compliments 
and contrasts with Gab's. 

Another highlight of the show 
was Erinn Anova, whose soulful

and powerful voice weaves 
through the songs and gives emo-
tional 'punch to their choruses. 
This trio of innovators never dis-
appoints its audiences. 

The performances of "Decep-
tion" and "You Didn't Know That 
Though" show off the inventive-
ness of the group's lyrics and 
beats, which are influenced by 
tribal sounds and synthesized 
instruments. The driving rhythms 
of these songs, along with sing-
song choruses, got the members 
of the crowd involved and bob-
bing their heads. 

Gab and Lateef even did a flow 
over the beats from the legendary 
Roger & Zapp. As a contrast to 
the other beat-heavy songs, "Shal-
low Days" and "If I May" are con-
templative pieces that flow like 
storytelling. These lyrics are smart 
and personal narratives that keep 
the crowd interested and emo-
tionally connected. 

The show was 18 and up, a 
rare occurrence in San Diego.

Album: 
Wallflowers return with 
sultry rock style 
contInUed from .... 17 

The Wallflowers are back into 
Iheir comfonable, sulky rock style. 
As the follow-up to 1996's "Bring-
ing Down Ihe Horse: the new 
album slays true to the mellow 
movement that made the band 
famous; there are no new tricks. 

In Wallflower fashion, laid-back 
guitars play second string to Jakob 
Dylan's soft voice. and the band's 
good-tempered alternative sound 
plays second string to Dylan's 
somber lyrics. In "Hand Me Down," 
Dylan sounds like the frustrated son 
of a demanding father - almost c~rÂ­
tainly a song directed at hiS real-h.fe, 
rock icon father. "I've Been Dehv-
ered" offers the album's first sign of 
optimism, even though a majority of 
its lyrics play to a dark atmosphere. 

Dylan humbly sings his dreary 
lyrics over a backdrop of sympa-
thetic guitars throughoul the 
album, bUI, in its own bleak way, 
his musical expression is resolved 
and satisfying.

powerfully moving. Hanks, who has

ROBERT FULTON 

T he college footbaH season is winding down, and by the time we all return 
fr.om our glorious winter break, the 
winner of the national champi-
onship will have been decided at 
Ihe range Bowl in Miami. And if 
you believe that, I have some 
swamp land to sell you, also locat-
ed in Florida. 

,The way that college football 
decides on its national champion is 
ridiculous. Instead of a playoff for-
mat that would pit all deserving 
te!lll1S against one other, a special 
few are selected in what is known 
as the Bowl Championship Series. 

The Bowl Championship Series 
takes a school's record, various 
polls, strength of schedule, how 
much it has outscored its oppo-
nents, the meaning of life, its 
mom 's age divided by the number 
of No. 1 Beatles songs, combines 
that with some fuzzy math, and 
voila! It magically comes up with 
the best college football team in the

T iger Woods is bigger than the PGA. This is a straight-up fact, and to 
extrapolate upon this a little fur-
ther, Woods is bigger than just 
aboul anything out there, except 
maybe a Barcelona versus Madrid-
soccer match. Sorry to all those 
basketball and baseball and football 
prima donnas, but Woods over-
shadows just about any athlete, if 
not any event or personage around. 

Woods has captured the imagi-
nation of the country and of people 
around the world, and all through a 
sport such as golf. Golf is a great 
sport and it is fun to play, but con-
versely, how much fun is il to 
watch? Golf is usually just a bunch 
of tubby. pasty white men huffing 
around a golf course, each in pur-
suit of one of those enormous 
purses that golf tournaments pro-
vide. There is no action in golf like 
there is in football, basketball or 
baseball (though some people 
might disagree with me Ihere). 

Despite goWs innate disJldvan-
tage in the area of excitement, 
Woods, like The Bear before him, 
has transcended the spon of golf 
and has come to repre~nt some-
thing better than just his sport. He 
is pan of that new class of athletes,

The Triton water polo team is 
gOillg to the NCAA Final 
Four,after sweeping the competi-
tion at the Western Water Polo 
Association Championships two 
weeks ago. 

It will compete with UCLA, 
Navy and USC. Although USC 
lost to Pepperdine in the first 
round of the Mountain Pacific 
Spons Federation Tournament. it 
was awarded an at-large berth 
based upon its regular season 
record. 

UCSD dominated the WWPA 
tournament with its defen~. It 
allowed fewer than five goals in 
each garhe. For his effons, Glenn 
Busch, 1riton goalkeeper, was 
named to the all-WWPA second 
team. 

"Our defense really re-
emerged this tournament and led 
us 10 the win,Â· said head coach 
Denny Harper. 

The Thtons' first game in the 
tournament was against Chami-
nade, and it was a laugher. UCSD 
made it look like second graders 
with a bed-wetting problem and 
took it down 17-4. 

Air Force was UCSD's next 
opponent and the toughest of the 
tournament. In the end, though, 
UCSD proved too strong and 
won 6-4. 

The last game against Loyola 
Marymount was close, but UCSD 
pulled away to win 10-5. 

Jonathan Samuels, who has 
been a rock for UCSD all season 
long, rose to the occasion at this 
tournament and annihilated 
opposing defenses, shredding any 
front thrown at him. 

Samuel;; was named the all-
WWPA Most Valuable Player. 

"[Samuels is aJ man amongst 
boys; Harper said. "All season 
long he has lead the team and has 
been the dominant player in the 
pooL" . 

Justin Wylie and Samuels were 
named to the all-WWPA first 
team. 

Joining Busch on the second 
team were Jason Boettner and 
Vladimir Djopic, each outstand-
ing contributors in the 'Tritons' 
ru n to th is year's Fi na I Four. 

"Who Icad us through this 
tournament were our seniors," 
Harper said. "[Vladimirl Djopic, 
Jason [BoettnerJ, Ken Woodruff, 
Justin Wylie and Glenn Busch 
really emerged and gave it their all 
and helped us win." 

UCSD will f~ce tough com-
petition in the first round of the 
NCAA championships. [t will 
play USC, which just barely 
squeaked by the Tritons 7-5 at

The women's soccer team looks to leave a 
permanent mark on Division II 
I, ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

At the beginning of the year, 
what every_women's soccer team 
wanted was a trip to the champi-
onships. 

Now, at the year's end, teams 
from the top Division II schools 
in the nation gather in Miami 
Shores, Fla. to compete in the 
NCAA Division II Final Four. 
One of these four teams is the 
UCSD women 's soccer squad. 

The Tritons have rumbled to a 
1 9-2 record on their way to the 
Final Four. They won a California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
crown and are currently ranked 
third in the nation. 

To get to the semifinals, the 
Tritons siormed past Sonoma 
State University 2-0 in the Far 
West Region Championship. In 
the quarterfinals, UCSD 
downed Central Oklahoma Uni-
versity 6-2. 

In the semifinals, the test for 
the Tritons will become even 
more difficult. They must take 
on defending Division II nation-
al champions Franklin P.ierce 
College on Friday. Franklin 
Pierce currently sits at 18-2-2. 

On the other side of the bill, 
Barry University will face 
Northern Kentucky University. 
Barry comes into the finals 19-
0, while Northern Kentucky is 

the only team in the Final Four 
to win 20 games, sporting a 20-
1-2 record . 

The winners of each semifinal 
will face off on Sunday at Miami 
Shores. 

What the Tritons have accom-
plished so far is exceptional. [n 
their first year al the Division II 
level, they have already claimed a 
spot among the elite. 

. The Tritons hope to be the 
first CCAA school since 1991 to 
take home a championship. 
National titles are not new to 
UCSD, which won five while 
playing at the Division [[I level. 

Every school in the Final Four 
will be tough competition, but 
the TIitons can hold their own. 
UCSD boasts CCAA Coach of 
the Year Brian McManus, who 

. has earned a 235-27-18 (.871) 
record in 14 years as coach of the 
'Tritons. 

Cindy Dostalek and Julia 
Cuder, who have scored 10 
goals and 9 assists and 8 goals 
and 13 assists, respectively, are 
CCAA first team members. 
Erika Alfredson made the CCAA 
second team with 15 goals and 7 
assists this season. Goalkeeper 
Kami Poma has been spectacu-
lar in defending the net. 

With these weapons and 
many 'mort, ,the Thtons are well-
prepared to be successful at the 
Final Four.

Bowl: 
A playoff format would 
better solve who's No.1 
eonu. ... frOIII ,.,. 1. 
nation. 

Right now, Oklahoma stands at 
No.1 because it is the only unde-
feated school. Fair enough. But 
what about second place? Who 
should be ranked second is not 
quite so clear. 

So far, Florida State looks like 
it will be second. Miami is ranked 
third and Washington is fourth. 
Even though Miami defeated 
Florida State and Washington 
knocked off Miami and each has 
only one loss, they are ranked in 
reverse order. 

Why is this? Well, first off, peo-
ple back East don't like any team 
that is not from the East, especial-
ly those from the West Coast. 
Also, football "experts" are infatu-
ated with schools from Florida, 

Polo: 
Tritons have a chance 
at a title this year 
ContInued frOlll ...,. 1. 

The Tritons had a chance to 
beat USC, but gave up a couple 
of goals from 9 meters, which 
doomed them . 

Despite their year-end 
slump, the Tritons seem to have 
regained the confidence and 
form that allowed them to start 
the season on a tear. They 
ranked as high as fifth in the 
nation, a position that they held 
for two weeks. 

If the Tritons can retain this 
form and eliminate the kinds of 
mistakes that belayed their loss 

With finals on the horizon Ind 
holi~ around the 1tend, it's 

especially Florida State. [ don't 
know what it is, but the football 
people in this country love Florida 
State. 

Another question arises: What 
if Oklahoma loses to Kansas Sate 
this weekend in the Big 12 cham-
pionship game? That would leave 
a plethora of teams with only one 
loss. The top leam will be deter-
mined by some computer, run by 
some guy who has never ever been 
within a mile of a football field. 
Boy, that's fair. 

If Oklahoma loses this week-
end to Kansas State, which very 
well may. happen, Florida State 
will become No.1 and Miami will 
be No. 2. The two teams will duke 
it out in the Orange Bowl, played 
in Miami. So, a pair of colleges 
from Florida will play in a bowl 
game in Florida . Whoopdee 
freakin' doo. 

What is needed is a playoff for-
mat. Take the top 16 teams and 
start a tournament the first week-
end in December, and have it run 

to USC, they have a serio liS 
chance to overcome the Tro-
jans. 
. "The Trojans might be look-
mg past us to UCLA," Harper 
said. "They have such a rivalry 
there and after their earlier loss 
they have a lot of emotion 
invested. With the way we are 
playing that is going to play to 
our advantage: 

The NCAA Final Four will 
be played this weekend in Mal-
ibu. The UCSD vs. USC game 
will be held at 2:30 p.m. Satur-
day. 

The winner of this game will 
play UCLA or Navy in the 
championship game at 2:30 
p.m. Sunday. The third-place 
game will be held at 1 ".m. Sun-
day.

until New Year's Day. Yes, there will 
be a lot of argument when it comes 
to who should be the 16th team 
but at le~t this guarantees that th~ 
top elite eight or 10 schools will all 
be given a shot at playing in the 
national championship. 

This is the only sport to act so 
absurdly. Professional football has 
playoffs. College basketball has 
one of the biggest playoffs in the 
nation in their much-hyped Road 
to the Final Four. Football would 
be just as big, if they would only 
do it. 

Why don't they? The sponsors 
of the bowl won't let them. There 
is a lot of money involved in this 
business, but just as much can be 
made with a playoff. TheÂ· powers 
that be must realize this. 

College football needs a playoff 
format to legitimize itself. Until 
then, it will wallow in the bullshit 
of polls and.computers, with each 
year culminating in nothing more 
than a mythical national champi-
on.

Tiger: 
Other sports stars 
cannot even compare 
ContInued rr- ,.. 22 
the athletes in professional sports, 
anq, Woods Icads all of these peo-
ple; He is the head of the class. 

I remember seeing Woods on 
'Scholastic Sports," an old ESPN 
show, when I was about 12 years 
old, whICh would make him some-
where around lS or 16. Even then, 
the guy had it in him, and you 
c?uld t.ell ~e was going to be great. 
I Just dldn t know that he was going 
to be this spectacular. He is win-
ning major tournaments like 
they're miniature golf at the local 
put-put and taking event after 
event from the best golfers in the 
world, relegating them the place of 
candyless, screaming babies. 
'.,' This year alone he has won 10 
tOurnaments and collected over 
$12 million in prize money. By the 
Y'ay, as long as we are talking about 
money, let's not forget the $S4 mil-
lion he will be making in endorse-
ments this year. At the same time, 

. he wins with class. He gives defer-
ence to those who have gone 
before and to those who will come 
a1t~r him. He has studied his game 
apd plays it with edict. 
. He had such a good stan, no slip 
ups, no gargantuan sporting ego 
taking the place of his fragile perch 
atop America's current sports 
l\eroes. We should have known 
though, that the days where a ma~ 
can stay atop forever are gone, if 
they even existed at all. Even Joltin' 
Joe went through a phase of disdain 
when he became the first million-
dollar man in baseball. . 

But here is Woods, this year 
alone, $66 million richer, and he 
hints that because of his popularity, 
he and only he in this day and age 
should be entitled to more money: 
specifically some of the TV money 
that will be negotiated next YeN, 
because of the number of people 
that he attracts to the tournament. 

When asked if he thought he 
was entitled to more money than 
other players, Woods responded, 
Â·Philosophically? [n a perfect world 

I would be. Arnold [palmerI would 
be. All the great ones would. Arnold 
is the one who got it all started: 

Right you are, Tiger, and good 
job maintaining your image of 
young upstart deferring to the 
greats, but as Dave Anderson of 
The New York Times points out, 
"Palmer and Nicklaus helped 
resolve the Tour's financial struc-
ture a quarter century ago, but they 
were acting on behalf of the other 
touring pros, not just themselves." 

Note to Tiger: This is not what 
you are doing. 

Furthermore Tiger has been 
complaining about how the com-
missioner of golf, Tim Finchem, 
doesn't talk to him enough, sayi.ng, 
"The only time he talks to me is 
when he wants me to do something 
for him - to play in this tourna-
ment or that tournament. [t's not 
like he comes 'up to me and asks 
me how I'm doing.~ 

What is he, S years old? I am 
sure Bud Selig is calling up Barry 
Bonds and Mike Piazza all the time 
just to shoot the breeze. Why don't 
you grow some cajones and learn 
to' survive on your own? The com-
missioner's job is not to make you 
feel better, Tiger, but to make the 
sport that he presides over better 
for all the players in it. Finchem 
probably goes up to Phil Mickelson 
and David Duval once a week and 
asks them how their day is going. 
Wait, I forgot - those players don't 
matter. do they. It is only Woods 
and his $66 million-plus that 
should matter to the PGA. 

Maybe this is just a stage. TIger 
could be tired of the hype; I would 
be. All day every day, followed, 
harangued and accosted by anyone 
and everyone. Maybe this is his way 
of lashing out, and I hope so, 
because if that is what it is, then it 
is not that bad. He could be punch-
ing cameramen, like certain movie 
stars have been known to do. 

However, if Tiger has any com-
mon sense left in that brain, which 
seems to have been swelled by the 
sweet nectar known as feeling 
God-like, he will just get back to 
playing and retire 30 years from 
now as possibly the greatest sports-
man the United States has ever 
produced.
