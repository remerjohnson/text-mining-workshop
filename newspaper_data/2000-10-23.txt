11,000 People Walk to Rai. 
Money for Breast Cancer 
The Women's Center and Muir college also get involved 
By JIUICA IUlUSKAMP 
Staff Writer 

Eleven thousand people participated early 
Sunday morning in the American Cancer 
Society'S third annual Making Strides Against 
Breast Cancer fund-raiser in Balboa Park. 

The annual walk exceeded organizers' 
expectations of 8,000 participants and 
$300,000, the final statistics read 11,000 walk-
ers raising $600,000. 

The money will be used for breast cancer 
research, public education and patient pro-
grams. Most of it will be used locally, according 
to the American Cancer Society. 

UCSD and the UCSD Women's Center 
have participated in the walk for the past three 
years and have organized programs to get stu-
dents involved. 

The walk was sponsored by NBC Channel 
7/39, SAIC, San Diego Gas and Electric, 

Metabolife, and Sempra Energy Company. It 
included teams from some of the county's 
other corporations, schools and health institu-
tions, as well as private individuals who wanted . 
to raise money for breast cancer research. 

The walk, scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m., 
started with a welcome speech from NBC 
7/39's Susan Taylor, who outlined the day's 
events. 

Other s~akers included local doctors, can-
cer survivors, sponsors, patients and politicians 
who were there in support of the American 
Cancer Society. 

"This is our call to action and a reminder 
that there is hope in the progression of the 
curc," said California American Cancer Society 
Board of Directors President Maria Reyes-
Mason. "I know, as we all do, that everyone 
here cares about this and there are more out

Student Life 
Committee 
Faces Criticism 
Students demand 
structural changes at 
last Monday's meeting 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affai rs 
Joseph Watson commissioned a committee 
last May to discuss a proposed $75 per 
quarter fee referendum intended to improve 
student life at UCSD. 

At last Monday's meeting of the 
Student Life Fee Referendum, dozens of 
students criticized the fact that there was 
no established procedure for voting, that 
the chairs of the committee were voting 
members and not selected by the commit-
tee members, and that the specifics of the 
fee referendum had already been planned 
out by the administration. 

Even though the committee did not get 
to its agenda items at the meeting, Watson 
and students are confident the committee 
will go forward in a productive manner. 

The proposed fee increase, which is 
scheduled to be put to a vote during winter 
quarter 2001, would increase graduate and 
undergraduate quarterly fees by $75 per stu-
dent. 

The fee increase would fund an expan-
sion of the Price Center, a commuter center, 
offices for student organizations, support for 
Division II athletics, lounge furnishings and 
computers at each college, additional seating 
at the Grove Cafe, meeting rooms for stu-
dent organizations and other campus 
improvements. 

In addition, the fee increase would pro-
vide additional funding for the A.S. Council, 
the Graduate Student Association , the 
Women.:s · Center, sportS clubs, university 
events, the programming council. individual 
colleges. the Cross Cultural Center, and the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender 
Resource Office. 

According to the committee's mission 
statement, its purpose is to solicit input, eval-

'Three Professors Inducted into Prestigious Institute 
UCSD and Salk Scientists are among 60 chosen to join the Institute of Medicine 
By ~N UHTONIN 
Contributing News Writer 

Continuing as one of the lead-
ing institutes in modern science, 
UCSD saw three of its top scien-
tists recognized for their respec-
tive work in the field of medicine 
by being inducted into the presti-
gious Institute 'of Medicine. 

Professors Jerrold M. Olefsky, 
professor Larry R. Squire and 
Wylie W. Vale were among the 60 
elected to the Institute. 

Olefsky said he was deeply 
honored by his induction. 

"I was extremely pleased and 
complimented on the election to 
such a highly prestigio~s organ i-

zation: Olefsky said. 
Olefsky has been at UCSD for 

18 years working, mostly with 
insulin action in the body and its 
resistance as the primary cause for 
lYpe II diabetes. Olefsky's work 
has been crucial in the develop-
ment of insulin-sensitizing drugs 
now used as standard therapy to 
patients with 1Ype II diabetes. 

"This is a major election for 
[Olefsky) and for the school as 
well." said Betsy Hansen, secre-
tary to Olefsky for the past 27 
years. 

Currently, Olefsky is working 
on the desi$n of array gene chips, 
which prOVide a method of mea-
suring gene expression. The 

ribonucleic acid of normal 
patients can be compared to that 
of patients holding the gene lead-
ing to Type II diabetes. Areas 
where certain genes are over- or 
underexpressed can pinpoint the 
area of disorder. 

Olefsky is also presently work-
ing with genetically altered mice 
for a greater understanding of the 
role of certain genes in insulin . 

Induction into the Institute of 
Medicine will enhance the 
mantlepiece in the Olefsky home. 
Olefsky has been previously 
awarded with the Banting Award 
for Outstanding Scientific 
Achievements from the American 
Diabetes Association, the C.H. 

Best Award from the Toronto 
Diabetes Association of the ADA, 
and the Mayo Soley Award. 

Squire'S work deals mainly 
with cognitive science and neu-
roscience and specifically relates 
to long-term memory. 

Much of Squire 's findings 
came from his observations of 
postmortem studies of amnesia 
patients. 

Among his findings are. the 
exact location of the hippocam-
pus and other areas of long-term 
memory. 

Past awards won by Squire

Referendum: 
Watson agrees to remove 
Tucker as co-chair 
Continued from .,.,. 1 
uaLe options and advise Watson on a 
referendum to improve campus life; to 
review, endorse and recommend to 
Watson the election logistics, finances 
and conditions of the referendum; and 
to communicate with students. answer 
questions and serve as advocates for the 
approval of the referendum. 

At last Monday's meeting, when 
students called into question the 
logistics of the committee structure, 
Watson said he would remove Tom 
Tucker, assistant vice chancellor of 
student affairs, as one of the three 
co-chairs of the committee, because 
some members of the committee felt 
an administrator shou ld not be co-
chairing a student committee. 

Students also expressed concern 
over how the student co-chairs were 
chosen. 

"Are we going to address the issue 
that the chairs were not elected?" 
Marshall Student Council Chair 
Emiko Burchill. " I don't devalue that 
they're doing an excellent job except 
that I feel uncomfortable having the 
chair of the committee not be elected." 

" 0: Watson responded. "This is 
my committee. I'm trying to be 
responsive. 

"I'm also deeply concerned 
because the main objective here is to 
meet the needs of the students," 
Watson added. "How we get to a con-
clusion here, I think is cri tica l. I tried 
to set up a setting in whi h students 
would playa major role. I think this is 
that setting." 

At the end of the meeting. the 
ommittee appointed a student con-

sultant, since all of the consultants 
initia lly on the committee were 
administrators. The committee also 
appointed a historian to take minutes 
at the meetings. because many stu-
dents said the minutes of the first 
meeting were not comprehensive 
enough. 

A.S. Senate Chair Shana Takur. 
who attended the meeting, said she 
was pleased with what the students 
accomplished. 

"The students got back some 
power: she said. "This is the first time 
I've seen student empowerment since 
I've bl-en here." 

Takur said she was still concerned 
with some aspects of the committee 
makeup, including the fact that there 
is only one representative from a cul-
tural organization. while the commit-
tee has three sports-related represen-
tatives and two representatives from 
Greek organizations. 

Takur also said, however, that she 
remained optimistic that the commit-
tee could move forward and be pro-
ductive. 

Watson agreed. 
"I'm very optimistic,' he said. "I 

think this is one thing that is very crit-
ical to the campus. 

" [ think we're both after the same 
thing, what is best for our current and 
future students ... [ don't see how as a 
campus we can anticipate a growth of 
40 percent in the student body and 
not start planning for it now." 

The committee, which has met 
twice so far, will hold its next meeting 
Oct. 30 at 5 p.m. in the University 
Centers, room 111 A. .

UCSD Uses Stimulator to Treat Depression 
UCSD Healthcare p/lysicians are looking at a 

new treatment for depression that uses a device 
that functions like a pacemaker and is usually 
used to treat epilepsy. 

according to UCSD Admissions and Outreach. 

The device is called the Vagus Nerve 
Stimulator and will be implanted in 10 to 15 San 
Diegans who are considered extremely 
depressed and who have not responded to tradi .. 
tiona I drug therapy. 

The meeting is intended as a forum for 
Native Americans on campus to discuss their 
interest in restarting the group and what 
NASA's role and mission as a student group 
should be. 

UC ScIentists to Discuss Weeds 
at Monterey Conference ~ccording to national mental health organi. 

zatlOns, 17 million to 19 million Americans suf· 
fer from depression, and an estimated one mil. 
lion to three million are considered treatment 
resistant. 

More than 7,000 patients have used the 
device since it was approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration in 1997. 

When used in treatment, the stimulator is 
inserted in the patient's upper chest during .out-
patient surgery. Wires run from the device into 
the parts of the brain that control mood and 
emotion. 

The current study using the device to treat 
depression will take place at 20 sites through-
out the United States. 

UCSO will be the only test site in Southern 
California.

Vice President Al Gore has a lot to offer America as its new 
leader and has the experience to back up his promises 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Senior Staff Writer 

I do not know about everyone else here, 
but I am voting this November, and I am 
voting for Vice President AI Gore. Other 
candidates may have better platforms in 
specific areas, but Gore is my pick overall 
for the next leader of the free .world. 

He believes in protecting the environ-
ment, the nation's children and the rights of 
all Americans. He also feels that we should 
use $2 .3 trillion of the 
budget "surplus" to pay 
off the national debt and 
to save Social Security. 
Governor George W. 
Bush's plan for the debt 
would only reduce it by 
$1 trillion . 

The Social Security 
payoff makes a lot of 
sense because much of 
this seemingly extrane-
ous money is in the Social Security fund, but 
the government keeps borrowing from it 
and racking up a largely-ignored debt to the 
fund. Gore wants to put Social Security in a 
"lock box: a section of the budget where it 
cannot be touched or borrowed from while 
Bush still treats Social Security as free 
money. I, on the other hand, would like 
those young people today who are paying 
money into Social Security to see some kind 
of return from it instead of watching their 
money disappear down a government hole. 

Beyond government transfer programs, 

Gore is a leader in environmental issues. He 
promises to support the development of 
cleaner energy and the protection of the 
oceans and ozone. He wants to declare the 
next decade as the "Environmental Decade: 
one in which large advances are made in 
removing pollutants from the world around 
us. He has chosen the environment as one of 
his key issues and has supported environ-
mentalist efforts throughout his political 
career, even writing the book "Earth in the 
Balance." 

As a U.S. senator, 
Gore sponsored bills to 
research global warming 
and to diminish usage of 
ozone-harming chemi-
cals. As president, he will 
continue these endeav-
ors. He promised that oil 
drilling will be stopped 
off the California and 
Florida coasts. 

However, under 
Bush's voluntary environmental plans in 
Texas. over 200,000 children will potentially 
be exposed to industrial pollution near their 
schools. Houston has higher air pollution 
levels than Los Angeles, and according to 
the Huuston Chronicle, "even if every car were 
ta~n off the road, Houston would still not 
be in compliance with federal safe ozone lev-
els." Ralph Marquez, a chemical lobbyist, 
obviously had a stake in lowering environ-
mental standards for the state of Texas. Yet,

In little more than two weeks, American

faced with a crossroads in our history. We 
can elect the vice president, AI Gore, or his

the Middle East because we have conducted 
a foreign policy that has no clear purpose but 
is rather determined by photo opportunities.

Options to 
Choose 
From 

SHANNON CASTLE 

While I have to admit that I'm 
not exactly politically aware, I know 
enough to ~ totally .dissa.tisfied 
with the available chOices In the 
upcoming elections. If I do choose 
to exercise my right to vote, I Will 
be voting not for the best man for 
the White House, but rather, for 
the lesser of two evils. 

To date. I have been singularly 
unimpressed witl) the abilities and 
character of both Vice President AI 
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. 
Since it doesn't seem very hard to 

- find better candidates than these 
two, I'd like to suggest a few other 
choices. 
. If you like what you see, writ.e 
one of these in on your ballot- It 
won't change anything for the 
United States, but it may make you 
feel a little better about your con-
tribution to democracy. 

1. Chancellor Dynes: As far as I 
can tell, he hasn't done anything 
too drastic at UCSD. If he does the 
same for the country, we should be 
safe - unless he actually. has to 
handle a war or something. 

2. Jesse Jackson: I'm actually 
pretty sad that Jesse's not running 
this year. I like him. Unfortunately, 
our country really, really likes old, 

, white males, and Jesse just doesn't 
fit into the "white" part of that. 
. 3. Oprah Winfrey: Oprah really 
seems to have her act together. 
What's more, she has spent her 
entire life trying to solve other peo-
ple'S problems, so she's got ple~ty 
of practice. She even has a conSid-
erable following built up. 
Unfortunately for her campaign, 
she's not white, and she's not an 
old man (see above). 

4. Scott Foley: For those qf you 
who don't spend your Wednesday 
night watching the WB, Foley plays 
Noel on "Felicity: I've been madly 
in love with his character for a 
while now, and I fully believe that 
he's able to handle the demands of 
the U.S. presidency. 

S. Britney Spears: I just want to 
get her doing so~e~hing for a liv-
ing other than singing and show-
ing off her stomach. Maybe if she's 
busy handling the nation, she 
won't have time to dance. 

6. Mister Rogers: Unlike the 
candidates I've seen, Fred Rogers is 
honest, trustworthy, intelligent, 
and really does have our best inter-
ests in mind. He's got my vote any 
day. 

7. Hillary Clinton: Just kidding. 

Last, but certainly not least: me. 
I think that I'd make a great presi-
dent. I promise to stay away from 
sexual scandal and to be slightly 
Ic;ss obnoxious than Bill Clinton . 

I don't have a clue how to han-
dle the taxes or the situation in 
Israel, but I don't think that Gore 
and Bush do either, so we're all 
even. As soon as I come up with a 
catchy slogan, you 'll see me in the 
running. I can count on your votes, 
can't I? 

Well, I hope I've given you all 
something serious to think about 
today. What do you want for your 
country in the future? Take a 
stand. 

Let's get some decent people in 
the White House. I've given you . 
some suggestions, but feel free to 
come up with your own. You have 
a whole country of people to 
choose from .

Editor: 
This is a letter in response to 

the anicle "Thmsfer Students Ask 
for Funding" by Ed Wu on the 

Oct. 16 front page of the 
Guardian . In the article, Wu stated 
that the All-Campus TI-ansfer 
Association was created to 
"address the lack of activities and 
suppon for transfer students. at 
Marshall ... due to the graduation 
of [thilt) colle~e's tran..sfer student 
support coordinators. 

This statement is completely 
unfounded. We are the co-chairs 
of the Transfer/Re-Entry Student 
organization, referred to as the 
"transfer student support coordi-
nator" for Marshall , and have 
been for the last year and a half. 

The article also stated that 
only Muir and Roosevelt "cur-
rently provide funding for transfer 
student activities." This is also 
inaccurate because Marshall's 
student council has consistently 
allocated funding for TRES since 
it began several years ago. 

As for the transfer organization 
at Marshall being "defunct: we 
would like to point out that his-
torically, TRES has held many 
meetings and programmed sever-
al large events for the transf~r 
population at the college. ThiS 
quarter alone, TRES has already 
had an ice cream social, two meet-
ings and began the planning of 
this year's events. 

Our main concern is the well-

being and successful integration 
of Marshall's transfer students 
into UCSD. We are unclear on 
why there was no attempt to con-
tact Marshall college to verify 
these facts. Marshall has been a 
forerunner in transfer advocacy 
and will continue to work on 
addressing transfer students ' 
needs. 

With regard to the All-Campus 
1ransfer Organization, TRES sup-
ports the establishment o~ a coun-
cil that would help to unate trans-
fer students from all colleges. For 
this cause, we would like to invite 
any interested transfer students to 
share their ideas with us and see 
TRES in action at our next meet-
ing on Oct. 24 at 3 p.m.

described the competitors from 

Equatorial Guinea, Paula Barila 
Bolopa and Eric Moussambanl, as 
"Olympic crashers: "streakers ~f

performance as "grotesque" and 
"uncompetitive." I feel honor-
bound to reply in kind. . . 

We are students of a university. 
Except for the few of us who will , 
or have, carried the flag of our 
nation in a place such as Sydney, 
Atlanta or Barcelona, many of us 
will not have the chance to com-
pete in the Olympics. Bearing this 
in mind, Miller, I remind you that 
the Olympics are not merely 
"about seeing the best of the best 
compete against each other: or 
simply about "the pure sport: 

The Olympics, sir, are about a 
truce enacted to allow the warring 
nations of ancient Greece to 
engage in honored athletic events 
such as the 200-meter run, the 
javelin and the discus. They are 
about the Olympic truce. This 
moment of peace in a tumultuous 
world is supposedly what the 
Olympics are about. I would has-
ten to add that the Olympics are 
not merely about sports. .

6 OPINION 

Gore's polides are best for 
America 

Bush appointed him as the leader of 
Texas Environmental Agency. [t 
does not seem like Bush has an 
interest in cleaning up the pollution 
of Texas, let alone that of the rest of 
America. 

Gore also has promising plans 
to help and protect our nation's 
children. He will invest $8 billion in 
raising teacher salaries in districts 
that devote energy to increasing 
their teacher quality, and promotes 
a proposal to build and modernize 
6,000 schools. He plans to connect 
every classroom and library in every 
school to the Internet to help teach 
children how to operate the elec-
tronic equipment so prevalent in 
our lives today. 

While a U.S. senator, he also 
helped protect children, co-spon-
soring the Children's Justice and 
Assistance Act of 1986, a legislation 
crack-down on child abuse. He 
supported other legislation creat-
ing a telephone network to help 
locate missing children. 

Bush, however, neglected Texas 
children's health with a health care 
system so terrible that a federal 
judge actually ordered the state to 
fix it. Texas ranks 49th in the 
nation in children's health care. 

Gore. on the other hand, wants 
to expand the availability of health 
care to more poor children. The 
Clinton-Gore administration creat-
ed a children's health insurance 
program which will cover up to 
eight million children in the United 
States. 

[f Bush does not care about 
children's health in Texas, how can 
he care about the future of the 
nation? Gore is much stronger in 
this category than Bush, and will 
protect the leaders of tomorrow 

Thinking about applying to 
graduate or professional 
school, but not sure which 
direct ion to take? Our Fair is 
the perfect opportunity to 
explore your optionsl 

from sickness. disease, abuse and 
poverty. 

Gore will also act to preserve 
and promote human rights, work-
ing to make his administration "the 
most diverse in history: His Web 
site states that "it is time for all 
Americans to recognize that the 
issues that face gays and lesbians in 
this country are not narrow, special 
interests; they are a matter of basic 
human civil rights." 

He will try to increase the sen-
tences for hate crimes of all kinds. 
As president, Gore also plans to 
fight for an expansion of the Brady 
Law to violent juvenile delinquents. 
[n the Senate chamber he has sup-
ported these views by assisting 
efforts to ban assault-style weapons 
and co-sponsoring a bill that 
increased sentencing to a mandato-
ry five years in prison for criminals 
using armor-piercing bullets. 

In Texas, Bush's administration 
did nothing when they found out 
that many convicted felons might 
have possessed guns illegally. 
Federal law prohibits felons from 
owning guns, and they should have 
been prosecuted. Crime has also 
increased in many cities in Texas 
while the nation's crime rate has 
dropped, contrary to what Bush 
claims. 

Gore's record supports these 
campaign promises and more, 
which one reason he has so much 
support from so rnany groups. To 
me, Bush is nearly incapable of 
running a nation as complex as the 
United States, and is therefore not 
an option for the American presi-
dent. Bush does not possess the 
experience his challenger has. Gore 
has been in the federal government 
for over 24 years, while Bush was 
only elected governor of Texas in 
1994, a scant six years ago. 

AI Gore is the best candidate 
running in this race and has a sig-
nificant chance of winning the 
presidency. Let us work toward 
making that happen. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Con: 
American people deserve 
better than Gore 
_ ....... ,.... ..... 
Committee . • Americans, in the 
middle class or otherwise, never 
received their tax cut. Day by day, 
more and more Americans are 
going without health insurance. 
In addition, the expected date by 
which the Social Security trust 
fund will go bankrupt has not 
changed over the past eight years. 

With a record so filIed with 
failure, Gore is trying to run on 
the health of the economy. His 
argument that is due to the 
vibrancy of the economy, he is the 
best man to continue our eco-
nomic prosperity, not Gov. Bush. 
He likes to dwell on the belief that 
because of the current adminis-
tration, 22 million new jobs have 
been created over eight years, and 
the administration deserves credit 
for the 4 percent unemployment 
rate the nation is enjoying. 

While Gore and Clinton may 
like to take credit for this econo-
my, they fail to understand that 
the success this nation is enjoying 
is due to the hard work and inge-
nuity of the American people. It is 
the American people who deserve 
credit for creating the success of 
the past eight years, not the gov-
ernment. 

The American worker has 
transformed this country from 
one that relied heavily on military 
spending into one that is based in 
the new economy and Internet 
speed. For Gore to claim credit for 
the economy is much like the 
rooster demanding thanks for his 
part in allowing the sun to come 
up. 

While Gore cannot offer the 
American voter reasons he should 
become the next president, what 
he does offer is division and blame 

shifting. [n seeking the pl'tSidency, 
the Gore campaign has consistent-
ly sought to pit different groups of 
Americans against one another. He 
pits older voters against younger 
voters, saying that it is impossible 
to reform Social Security as Bush 
has proposed. 

He tries to scare senior citizens 
into thinking the Bush plan will 
cut their benefits. In actuality, 
there is plenty of money in the 
social security surplus to allow for 
younger voters to invest money 
for themselves and for older citi-
zens to count on their social secu-
rity checks. 

For Gore to claim credit 
for the economy is much 
like the rooster 
demanding thanks for 
his part in allowing the 
sun to come up. 

Gore goes on to divide the 
American people into the haves 
and the have-nots. He tells those 
on the lower end of the socio-eco-
nomic ladder that the Bush tax 
plan will give the rich an unfair 
portion of the tax relief. 

A reality check will show that 
the Bush plan seeks to lower taxes 
for all, even eliminating them 
altogether for the poorest of fami-
lies. [n the end, those with wealth 
will still pay the vast majority of 
taxes. Dividing people into such 
groups and telling each that the 
other has an unfair advantage in a 
Bush-run administration is un-
American and baseless. 

Fortunately, there is a better 
alternative to the politics of divide 
and conquer: Bush. The gover-
nor's record in Texas shows his 
strength in bringing people 
together. 
. He has worked with both 

~ 

~onda~(kjober23.2000 

Democrats and Republicans to 
make Texas a better place for all. 
The record will show that 
because of the bipartisan spirit 
that Bush has fostered, Texans are 
the better off. 

Over the past six years under 
the governor's leadership, Texas 
school children are learning, every 
year less people in the state are 
uninsured and the taxpayers of the 
state have had their taxes reduced. 
The success of the Bush adminis-
tration in Texas has been seen by 
70 percent of the voting public. 
who re-elected a governor for the 
first time in recent memory. 

Democrats, who control the 
state legislature, have also liked 
what they ' have seen, and many 
have endorsed Bush as the man 
who is most qualified to be .the 
next president of the United States. 

On Nov. 7, the American peo-
ple are faced with a choice. The 
choice we have to make should be 
made on the records of Gore and 
Bush. The vice president can only 
offer divisive attacks, because 
there are no major successes 
stemming from the Clinton-Gore 
administration, while there are 
numerous failures. 

Clearly America is not better 
off internationally than it was eight 
years ago. As a nation, our econo-
my is better off, but those success-
es have little to do with the vice 
president or his administration. 

On the other hand, Bush has 
brought tO$ether people of differ-
ent ideologies and will continue to 
do so if entrusted with the presi-
dency. The record he has to show 
as governor of one of the largest 
states in the Union is one of suc-
cess and bipartisanship. 

The contrasts between these 
two men cannot be more clear. Do 
we chose more of the same? Or do 
we chose something novel, with 
the promise of a fresh start where 
government is bipartisan and the 
people are better off for it?

Though sympathy .s 
given, skate,. need 
to respect campus 
Editor, 

[ am in sympathy with many 
points made in the editorial by _ 
David Pilz (The Editor's Soapbox, 
Oct. 9), but I would like to offer 
another perspe~tive on the issue of 
skateboarding on campus. 

I grew up on a skateboard, and 
though my friends and I wt:ren't 

very accomplished, we used. skate-
boards as means of entertainment 
and transportation . Especially as 
practiced by today's adherents, 
skateboarding requires a great deal 
of skill, it provides exercise, a mode 
of transportation, and it requires 
little in the way of equipment 
(cheap fun) . Skateboarding is the 
natural adaptation to an environ-
ment of concrete and asphalt. So 
why are there so many prohibitions 
against its practice? How did such 
an intrinsically wholesome sport 
become the province of grunge? 
Why is skateboarding considered 
by a number of authorities and 
skaters to be an act of rebellion? 
Who copped the first attitude? 

These questions might become 
the genesis for a dissertation in 
sociology, so rather than atteo:pt to 
provide a universal explanation I 
would simply like to relate my pre-
sent experience. [ have a corner 
office wrapped on two sides by 
concrete steps. Located strategical-
ly next to the steps are teak bench-
es and 12 inch curbs. There is a 
winding rail on the opposite side of 
the plaza. 

Although [ know this was not 
an intention of the architects, the 
area is excellent for street skating; 
however, it is also the place where [ 
am paid to write grants, manu-
scripts and lectures. It's where [ talk 
with students, predocs and fellows. 
It's where I dream up new methods 
to torture, er, educate students. 

Ollies, boardslides and grinds 
do not provide the meter for con-
templation. This is where I strong-
ly disagree with Mr. Pilz. People 
passing by on foot, bike or even 
skateboard, do not make a distur-
bance. [n contrast, every time a 
skateboard slams to the concrete, 
my adrenals kickflip and my heart 
boosts a 360. I begin to anticipate 
the next crash which, though irreg-
ular, is a certainty. My productivity 
is zilch . I have to admit there is also 
an aesthetic issue. UCSD is an 

OPINION 7 ' The UCSD Guardian 

attractive place to study and work, 
though it is my opinion that 
scraped curbs and ground b.enches 
are simply ugly. Even If nOIse ~as 
not a factor, grinding is destrucnve. 

Now, I'm not very comfortable 
as an authority figure, but my 
choice is to stew in my own adren- . 
aline, or have a word with the 
skaters. Event.ually ['m driven to 
the latter, and my experience is 
now sufficiently extensive to con-
stitute a scientifically significant 
sample. 

[ note that the preponderance 
of skaters are not UCSD students, 

. but most likely younger residents 
of the surrounding 'burbs. 
Typically, [ first wave to the indi-
viduals outside my window and 
pantomime excessive no!~~ . or 
point to the signs prohlbltmg 
skateboarding (they are now torn 
down). When that doesn't work, 
and it usually doesn't, I walk out 
and say, "I'm sorry guys, but you 
can 't skate here, it's 100 noisy." 
This is greeted in several ways, 
though my favorite is that I 
become the focus of a video cam-
era . What follows is a caricature, 
but it is accurate in the sense that 
out of at least 30 encounters only 
one skater said anything like, 
"OK, sorry man, thanks for being 
cool." 

The oldest boarders usually 
won't even look at me, as if I'm not 
recognizable as entity entitled to 
acknowledgment. The knit · caps 
cover intense anger. I'm not even 
worthy as an enemy. 

The second group includes 
adolescents early in high school. 
They sport spiked hair, often frost-
ed in a bright color, and spotless 
shoes. They at least look my way, 
but rarely make a verbal acknowl-
edgment. They leave, but not 
before acting out disdain . 

The third group are really very 
young. While they are not any eas-

oped an atti tude and one individual

When [ have chased skaters

that I pick up the phone to call the 
campus police. Suddenly, 
although seemingly oblivious of 
anyone inside the building, most 
skaters split. The slow ones are 
busted. 

Clearly, this much resentment 
comes from a feeling of unfairness, 

ex~essive restrictions and a per-
ceived tyranny. [n one sense this is 
perfect for post-adolescent 
teenagers. They need a target for 
rebellion, and lacking the Robert 
MacNamara we had, the enforcers 
of prohibitions on skating will suf-
fice. That's where the skate-postur-
ing comes in. 

Notwithstanding that tangential 
issue, the clash between skaters 
~nd those who oppose them is typ-
Ical of two groups with legitimate 
conflicting goals. Lacking enlight-
ened self-interest, they take up 
polarized positions and gird for

the other side; police treat skaters 
like gangsters, and skaters treat 
authority like faceless pigs. This 
type of conflict has taken place 
throughout history and all over the 
world. 

There is much that could be 
done by both sides. The city's 
fathers and mothers should be 
interested in providing places for 
skateboarding. The fact that they 
aren 't, [ suspect, comes from lazi-
ness more than an anti -skateboard 
agenda. 

The police are good at being 
authority figures, and adolescents 
are goo.d at giving them lip. Skaters 
have the most to gain, and they 
might consider directing some of 
the energy currently spent on frus-
tration toward lobbying city offi-
cials and businesses for skate 
parks. Writing to the newspaper is 
a good place to start, but organiz-
ing an entire message board to 
flood the news media and petition 
local government officials would be 
even better. 

There are many possibilities, 
and a little effort and ingenuity 
would go a long way. Destruction 
and defacement of property, and a 
seething resentment of anyone 
who doesn 't embrace unrestricted 
skateboarding is a waste of talent.

~D & NATION 
Albright Heading to North Korea 
to Pave the Way for Clinton 

In a landmark visit that signals 
an accelerating thaw in U.S. rela-
tions with North Korea, Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright will 
leave Sunday night to meet with 
the Communist leader, Kim Jong 
II, and to pave the way for a trip by 
President Clinton. 

The. hasty arrangements for 
Albright'S trip - made in less 
than 10 days for a visit that would 
normally take months to choreo-
graph - were another signal of 
the Clinton administration's 
desire to push ahead with improv-
ing hostile relations before 
Clinton leaves office. 

The usually reclusive North 
Korean leader made a surprising 
debut on the world stage earlier 
this year, holding a first-ever 
summit meeting with the South 
Korean president, Kim Dae-
jung, during which they made 
some progress in warming rela-
tions but left a raft of issues 
unresolved. 

Albright will be talking to the 
North Korean president about 
how far his country is prepared to 

go in shutting down its missile 
program and its missile exports to 
countries hostile to the United 
States, senior administration offi-
cials said. 

Other issues on the table 
between Albright and Kim will be 
North Korea's support of terror-
ism, the reduction of military 
tensions between North and 
South Korea and the possibility 
of opening liaison offices by the 
United States and North Korea 
in each other's countries, offi-
cials said. 

The sudden decision for 
Albright to travel to North Korea 
follows a visit earlier this month to 
the White House by Vice Marshall 
Jo Myong Rok, a senior North 
Korean military official, who 
issued an invitation for Clinton to 
go to Pyongyang, the North 
Korean capital. 

But the Pentagon is not 
enthusiastic. Last month it 
released a report with a pes-
simistic assessment about North 
Korea 's military intentions, say-
ing that North Korea showed no 

fundamental change in its pos-
ture. 

The report said that North 
Korea had stockpiled chemical 
weapons and continued to develop 
its short- and long-range missiles, 
though it had honored its pledge to 
American negotiators last year that 
it would not test them. 

Critics of the Clinton adminis-
tration policy toward North 
Korea, which began in 1994 with a 
U.S. pledge to build two nuclear 
reactors in exchange for a freezing 
of the North Korean nuclear pro-
gram, assert that the United States 
is keeping a totalitarian regime 
alive. 

"The United States has 
replaced the Soviet Union as a 
primary benefact~r of North 
Korea," a recent congressional 
study said. "The aid frees other 
resources for North Korea to 
divert to its weapons of mass 
destruction and conventional mil-
itary programs:

New Front Opens in Battle Against Race 
Bias in Loans 

NASHVILLE - Two c1ass-
action lawsuits filed in Nashville, 
Tenn., against two of the United 
States' most prominent automo-
bile finance companies have 
opened a critical new battlefront 
in government efforts to combat 
racial discrimination in the con-
sumer credit markets. 

The cases, filed under seal 
two years ago but recently 
unsealed on motions by The 
New York Times and the ABC 
News program "20/20," a~cuse 
General Motors Acceptance 
Corp. and Nissan Motor 
Acceptance Corp. of participat-
ing in lending arrangements 
with car dealers that have result-
ed in blacks paying higher 
finance charges than whites on 
dealer-arranged loans for buying 
cars. 

Both companies have denied 
that their finance charges are 
discriminatory, saying that the 
statistical studies on which the 
plaintiffs rely are profoundly 
flawed . 

They also assert that the inter-
est rates paid on the loans are the 
results of private negotiations 
between consumers and car deal-

ers, who profit directly from the 
higher rates. 

So the financing companies 
say they should not be held 
responsible for any discriminatory 
behavior involved in arranging the 
loans. 

But their defense is drawing 
fire from the Justice Department, 
which argues that lenders like 

The Government's stance 
. has also put the once-

obscure cases on the 
radar of the nation's 
giant consumer credit 
industry, 
Nissan Motor Acceptance and 
General Motors Acceptance 
should indeed be held responsible 
if the dealers who originate their 
car loans are violating federal fair-
lending laws. 

With its move, the govern-
ment has raised the hopes of 
consumer advocates, who say the 
cases may produce supportive 
rulings and fresh data that can be 

used to combat racial discrimi-
nation elsewhere in the market-
place. 

The government's stance has 
also put the once-obscure cases 
on the radar of the nation's giant 
consumer-credit · industry. The 
American Financial Services 
Association, which represents the 
biggest consumer lenders in the 
country, has already entered the 
cases in support of the defen-
dants. 

And the cases are clearly sig-
nificant for the companies 
involved. Nissan Motor 
Acceptance, in a recent appeal of 
the trial judge's refusal to dismiss 
the case, noted that the plaintiffs 
were seeking compensatory dam-
ages of at least $100 million, "an 
amount that would cripple 
NMAC." 

The plaintiffs in the cases are 
three black Nashville residents, 
Robert and Betty Cason, who are 
suing Nissan Motor Acceptance, 
and Addie Coleman, who is 
suing General Motors 
Acceptance.

ContI ...... from ..... 1 
pared to devote every spare hour to 
helping Gov. George W. Bush of 
Texas and other Republicans 
because that is what his true polit-
ical party, the National Rifle 
Association, wants. 

Davis is one of thousands of 
infantrymen from a host of inde-
pendent groups massing for what 
could be one of the largest, most 
bruising and expensive battles in 
recent history to get out the vote 
for the presidential election. 

With the race too close to call, 
those groups - including the NRA 
·evangelical churches, labor unions, 
the pro-choice lobby and environ-
mentalists - are mobilizing their 
members to make phone calls, 
knock en doors, distribute leaflets 
and post yard signs for their chosen 
candidates. 

While the candidates duel 
politely ' over plans for prescrip-
tion drug benefits and targeted tax 
cuts, the independent groups 
hammer at emotional issues like 
guns and abortion that are deeply 
important to significant slices of 
the electorate. 

Egypt: 
The summit focused on the 
peace process 
ContI ...... fron\ ..... 1 
ting . atroci ties in the last three 
weeks of clashes with Palestinians. 
They urged the United Nations to 
set up a war crimes tribunal to 
judge [sraeli actions and pledged 
vast aid to reli eve the battered 
Palestinian economy. 

But they stopped well short of 
renouncing the peace treaties that 
Egypt and Jordan have already 
signed with Israel and did not sug-
gest that the Palestinians them-
selves reject further negotiations in 
pursuit of an independent state. 

Instead, the Arab League -
which at its first summit meeting in 
four years was under severe scruti-
ny from the Palestinians and their 
supporters th roughout the Arab 
world - said it would end its, par-
ticipation in all official and unoffi-
cial efforts to integrate [srael into 
the economy of the Middle East. 

"We are not goi ng to let Israel 
do whatever it wants," Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Amr Mousa 
declared, speaking to reporters. 
"We have all this pressure on us, 
telling us that Israel needs to feel a 
part of the region. Well, if it wants 
to be part of the region, it has to act 
according to the law." 

And they are motivating those 
voters by drawing much sharper 
distinctions between the ca ndi-
dates than the cand idates are will -
ing to draw themselves. 

"Grass- roots organizing will be 
cr itical this year," said Donald 
Green, a political scientist at Yale 
University who has studied voter 
mobilization. 

"There are razor-thin margins 
in several key states. And any 
number of these states could be 
won by just a percentage point or 
two." 

The independent groups are 
using some of the toughest ora tory 
in this otherwise relatively tame 
campaign . 

Fear, said Tess Fields, a political 
organizer fo r the National Abortion 
and Reproductive Rights Action 
League in Missouri, is an essential 
mobilizing tool. 

"Our biggest problem is con-
vincing our people to vote . . 
beca use our guys keep looking fo r 
perfect candidates," said Kevin 
Jamison, one of the Missouri 
NRA members leading its cam-
paign efforts. 

So how do yo u convince 
them ? "Scare the hell Ollt of 
them," he replied. 

- James Dao 
The New York TImes 

Moussa added: "We mean busi-
ness here." 

Libya, which abstained from 
signing the statement, proclaimed 
itself the voice of stifled Arab mass-
es yearning for a complete break 
with Israel. Its delegates walked out 
of the summit meeting a few hours 
after it convened on Saturday, dis-
missing the Arab League delibera-
tions as a rhetorical exercise that 
would merely result in empty 
threats to [srael. 

[n the Arab world, public preoc-
cupation with the bloodshed in the 
Palestinian territories - in which 
more than 120 have died , all but 
eight of them Arabs - has sparked 
mass demonstrations and open 
calls for war. Many commentators 
on Arabic television and in news-
papers have speculated that the 
protests could turn against the 
authorita rian Arab regimes. 

The public theme of this week-
end's summit was that the peace 
process is no longer valid. Moussa 
dismissed [srael's peace-making 
activity as little more than "shut-
tling to Washington and photo 
opportu n i ties." 

The uprising by Palestinians, 
the summit statement said, is a 
direct outcome of Israel 's "inflexi-
bility, stalling and failure to imple-
ment its commitments."

Concem About Lobbyists is Increasing in the State of Maryland 
ANNAPOLIS - The last time a 

high-rolling Maryland lobbyist was 
convicted of corrupt behavior, the 
newly incarcerated felon boldly 
continued to enlist clients and 
lobby the Statehouse from a jail-
house pay phone. 

MHis income went up to 
$400,000 a year after the convic-
tion," laments Dale P. Kelberman, 
the assistant U.S. attorney who was 
the prosecutor in that case. "[t was 
very disheartening: people hiring a 
lobbyist knowing he was convict-
ed." 

But if a conviction for mail 
fraud and a six-month sentence did 
not deter Maryland's top-grossing 

lobbyist, Bruce C. Bereano, two 
years ago, neither did Bereano's 
activities totally discourage 
Kelberman. 

Last month, Kelbcrman 's prose-
cution of another blue-chip 
Statehouse lobbyist, Gerard E. 
Evans, ended with a 30-month 
prison term and a blistering mes-
sage to the state's citizenry from 
the sentencing judge that "there is 
a mess in Annapolis." 

[n sentencing Evans, who was 
convicted on 11 counts of mail and 
wire fraud, U.S, District Judge j. 
Frederick Motz warned of "a cul-
ture of corruption. that has been 
01 rated b lobbyists, Ie isla tOrs 

A special study 
commission on lobbying 
ethics began work last 
year after two law:makers 
had resigned in earlier 
ethics scandals. 
and the citizens of Maryland." 

The judge'S outcry has stirred 
statewide concern about the 
temptations for corruption here, 
with critics warning that a part-
time legislature with limited staff 
is increasingly at the mercy of a 
growing corp . of 00 lobbyi t 

working the Statehouse and fun-
. neling campaign money to law-

makers. 
"How many times do leaders of 

Maryland's General Assembly have 
to be hit by scandals before they 
reform their ways?" asked The 
Sun, Baltimore's daily newspaper 
in an editorial. . 

In a joint letter to The Sun, 
Senate President Thomas V. Mike 
Miller Jr. and House of Delegates 
Speaker Casper R. Taylor Jr. insist-
ed that the state had some of the 
strongest safeguards in the nation. 
They promised a new bill in the 
next sessIon to eqUire the licens-
in of lobb i ts. 

A special study commission on 
lobbying ethics began work last 
year after two lawmakers had 
resigned in earlier ethics scandals. 
Among its proposals is a barn-
door-closing measure to bar con-
victed lobbyists from plying their 
old trade. 

But the commission has reject-
ed a major proposal aimed at the 
mother's milk of politics, de,ciding 
it might be unconstitutional to ban 
lobbyists from making political 
contributions to the politicians

Learning about the disease 
is the key to the cure

then'. that care too." 

According to Regional 
Chairwoman of the American 
Cancer Society and breast cancer 
survivor America Donatto, the 
event was not just about the money 
thaI was raised, but the people for 
whom it was raised. 

"Judging by the number of 
breast cancer survivors who were 
here to celebrate life, it is apparent 
thaI we are making strides: 
Donatto said. 

She explained that the walkers 
were "people who want to demon-
strate love for their mothers, 
wives, sisters, friends and co-
workers who have been struck 
with breast cancer. Many of our 
participants walk to honor a lost 
loved one." 

According to Women's Center 
representative Emelyn de la Pefia, 
learning about the disease is a key 
to unlocking a cure. 

"The education is what is really 
important: de la Pefia said. "We 
need to get more people out here to 
get the word out about what is 
going on." 

Barbara Mendeas, also of the 
Women's Center, agrees. 

"It is really overwhelming once 
you see all these people out here, 
and it is easy to see how this event 
can be very emotional for people: 
Mendeas said. "Everyone is here 
for a reason, but we need to have 
more participants. We need more 
people." 

UCSD junior Erin Babcock 
received e-mails and memos from 
the Women's Center regarding the 
walk, and decided to get Muir col-
lege involved. 

Babcock recruited participants 
by posting flyers and organizing a 

carpool to transport a group of stu-
dents to Balboa Park. 

"It would have been great to 
have a lot more people out here, 
but those that we did have are 
great: Babcock said. "We have got 
quality if not quantity and we 
raised money for a great cause." 

Before the event began, 27th 
district Assemblyman Howard 
Wayne was introduced. 

Wayne was instrumental in the 
three-year-Iong passing of Bill 
2878, which allows low-income 
women to receive treatment for 
their illness through a $20 million 
addition to the budget. The bill was 
approved last year. 

According to Wayne, he is cur-
rently working on a bill under 
which uninsured women will be 
able to receive medical help. 

"We could not succeed without 
all the effort from all the people 
th:!t you see out here today.: 
Wayne said. "They are the ones 
who put in the effort so 1 can get 
the bill passed .... and we will get 
this new bill passed as well, no mat-
ter how long it takes." 

During the walk, many people 
were grouped by teams in support 
of companies, friends and loved 
ones. 

Walkers held signs proclaiming 
their affiliation and cheered at each 
other as they made their way to the 
finish line. Participants also donat-
ed food, took seats on the grass and 
listened to a congratulatory speech 
from Taylor. 

Muir freshman Jacob Ellena was 
pleased that he participated in the 
Stride Against Breast Cancer. 

"I had a good time for a good 
cause and 1 was surprised to see so 
many people out there .. . so many 
showed up: he said. 

Taylor triumphantly spoke to 
the participants as they crossed the 
finish line. 

"You are the ones who snow 
that they care. You are actually 
helping to save lives, ' Taylor said.

UNIVERSITY 
POLICE OFFICERS 
ARE REAL 
POLICEMEN WHO 
HAVE ALL THE 
RIGHTS AND 
PRIVILEGES OF 
CITY POLICEMEN 

The UCSD Guardian 

,

.. or 24 hours a day, 7 days a 

.j' week, 52 weeks a year, they 
, patrol the UCSD campus 

to keep students safe. They 
are the UCSD police offi-

cers. In their navy blue uniforms, metal 
badges and patches that read 
MUniversity of California Police 
Department," these officers can be seen 
all over campus. 

One of them is Jeff Cox, who has 
worked at the UCSD campus for 11 
years. He is also a UCSD Revelle 
College alumnus who graduated with a 
political science degree. 

UCSD has one police department 
office, located behind the Price Center 
near tht cluster of ATMs. This police 
department takes care of all crime on 
campus and within a one-mile radius 
around the campus. Despite any mis-

conceptions, the police officers in this 
office are not just hired employees of 
UCSD. 

"This is an actual police station: 
Cox said. "We have all the same author-
ity as the city police have. All the police 
officers here have been through the 
training at the police academy and are 
fully sworn police officers. Anything 
you can think of that a city police offi-
cer would do is what we would do. With 
any problems or domestic violence 
problems that occur on campus, we 
would be the ones they would come to, 
and we deal with it from there." 

The UCSD police office is a typical 
one with the difference being that it 
provides service mainly for UCSD stu-
dents.

Web Site Offers Services for Students 
An Qnline company targets college students for its comprehensive services rangingftom e-mail to file sharing 
By JOSH CROUS. 
Features Editor 

Think back to Welcome Week 
of your freshman year. What was 
the one thing you were most excit-
ed about? Was it the new environ-
ment, lack of parental authority or 
the proximity to Tijuana? [f you 
were like most freshmen, it was 
probably none of the above. The 
~ost exc~ting thing about college 
life for many students is the 
incredibly fast T1 Internet connec-
tion to which each student in the 
dormitories and apartments has 
access. 

However, many students s~n 
become disappointed at the severe 
limitations that are thrown at them 
from their e-mail servers and digi-
tal music lockers. There are prob-
lems ranging from a lack of file 
sharing between Yahoo! Mail and 
Myplay to there being only six 
megabytes of storage capacity on 
Yahoo! Mail. 

Students need not worry about 
these problems any longer, as a 
new Internet-based company is 
revolutionizing the electronic 
industry. In 1999, Edward C. Yu, 
along with his brother, Irving Yu, 
created e2417 Inc., operating out of 
their Santa Monica home. 

The Internet company, which 
can be found on the Internet at 
http://www.e247.com. provides all -
in-one e-mail, audio/video 
streaming and storage, free of 
charge. This is welcome news to 
poor college students looking for 
a quality e-mail provider and stor-
age system for their precious dig-
ital music. 

HISTORY 
Edward, who is the chief execu-

tive officer of e2417 Inc., previously 
worked as an international 
financier and ventures investment 
fund professional, a job that 
required him to travel frequently. 
[n order to lighten his load on 
cross-country trips from New York 

The Internet company, 
which can be found on 
the Internet at 
http://www.e247.com. 
provides all-in-one e-
mail, audio/video 
streaming and storage, 
free of charge. This is 
welcome news to poor 
college students looking 
for a quality e-mail 
provider and storage 
system for their precious 
digital music. 
to Los Angeles, as well as trips 
throughout Asia, Edward was 
inspired to find a way to stay con-
nected to his office without having 
to carry his laptop and suitcases 
full of office files, presentations and 
CDs. 

After searching f~r a centralized ' 
service that would allow him access 
to his communications. data and 
entertainment, Edward was prompt-

ed to create one of his own. The 
result was the genesis of e24rJ Inc. 

Edward became the CEO of the 
company, while his brother, Irving, 
became' the company's chief strate-
gy officer. 
TAII8ET AUDIENCE 

The primary target audience for 
e2417 is college students and 
online entertainment enthusiasts. 
Its secondary market is small busi-
nesses and home offices. 

Online companies are getting 
an increasingly larger audience. 
Recent estimates from the eStats 
Report of Oct. 1999 state that more 
than 92 million people use e-mail. 
The report speculates that the 
number of people using e-mail will 
grow to 135 million people by 
2002. 

The company is targeting this 
audience because, according to a 
Greenfield Online survey from this 
year, 15 million college students 
are e-mail enthusiasts. Of those 15 
million, the survey reports that 27 
percent of them cannot send or 
receive large files because it 
exceeds their online mailbox limits. 
Of those who were able to receive 
the files, over 25 percent reported 
not having enough virtual storage 
space with which to save the files. 

In the same survey, 75 percent 
of college students reported that a 
service similar to e2417 would be 
extremely valuable. 
SOLUTION TO THE PROIIlDIS 

The technology used by e2417 is 
an open-source platform that was 
developed using the Java language. 
It utilizes Java servlets on the back-

The Editor's Soapbox 
It is important for people to realize that everyone has problems, but it is how you deal with them that counts 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

OK, so I didn 't get an apartment 
like I wanted to last year. That's no 
big surprise. Despite this minor 
disappOintment, I've grown quite 
fond of my living situation. After 
all, being surrounded by first-year 
UCSD students isn't exactly a bad 
thing. Where else can you find in 
one place so many people who 
haven't yet experienced all our 
school has (and doesn't have) to 
offer? Even after half of a quarter, 
it's still nice to. see that they are rel-
atively content with their brand-
new lives. 

Living with freshmen as a 
sophomore has taught me a lot. 
I've noticed that, for many, the 
transition from home to dorm has 
been a smooth one. Unfortunately 
for others, the shock of living in a 
com£lletely different environment 
with 'strangers, all the while man-
aging a heavy class load, has been 
a lot more dramatic. It's precisely 
this ,1rama that I feel compelled to 
elaborate on during my rant. 
Perhaps in the process, a few 
readers may even find my sugges-
tions on leading a life less turbu-
lent a little helpful. Now, [ 
acknowledge that we all have 
problems, no matter how old we 
are. How we deal with our prob-
lems, however, makes all the dif-
ference. It would be nice to think 
that as we climb the ladder from 
freshmen to seniors, our problems 
would lessen . Alas. this isn 't the 
case. 

Should I be optimistic and say 
that problems are not bad, and that 

they make life interesting; in other 
words, that it's all about having 
perspective in a bad situation? Of 
course it is. Maybe it's also just a 
matter of being mature. Let's not 
forget that maturity is a relative 
thing, independent of factors such 
as age or sex. 

My point is that how we deal 
with our problems has a lot to do 
with who we are. On one hand, if 
you 're more level- headed and 
arguably more mature, you ' ll 
probably deal with emotional 
problems much better. On the 
other hand, if you're really losing 
your mind, I suggest a more 
proactive approach in alleviating 
your madness. It's true that soine 
deal with their issues productive-
ly, whether by means of work, 
music, art or simply through the 
most direct approach" which is 
talking to a person, like a trusted 
friend, counselor or even a psy-
chologist . The truth is that too 
many students cope by avoiding 
their problems or simply acting 
out their impulses. Whether it is 
by experimenting with the latest 
available drug on campus, having 
promiscuous sex with various 
partners, or just being over-the~ 
top with their personalities, stu-
dents often resort to making 
drastic changes to divert their 
anxiety. 

While I'm all for college being a 
time of challenging one's beliefs, 
trying new things and having a 
great time, I'm still an advocate of 
most things in moderation. 
It's one thing for college students 
to occasionally act like idiots, get 
drunk or smoke a little w.eed if they 

Now, I acknowledge that 
we all have problems, no 
matter how old we are. 
How we deal with our 
problems, however, makes 
all the difference. 
have a grip on their lives and don't 
have any serious issues. What's 
entirely different is when a person 
who does those same activities as a 
means of coping, or perhaps more 
accurately, fleeing from problems, 
most of which can be rather severe 
and repressed. 

It's very impressive to see how 
bright and ambitious the incoming 
class of 2004 is. Many have already 
become good friends of mine. 
Sadly though, this year's same pool 
of bright freshmen are no different 
than many of the classes that pre-
ceded them, at least emotionally 
speaking. At the risk of sounding 
overly cynical, they may even be 
worse' off. 

With each passing year, compe-

Students & Staff: 

tit ion into higher education is 
more and more cut- throat. No 
doubt , the stress levels of this 
year's incoming class is at a record 
high. Many of them already seem 
burned out, both mentally and 
physically. College offers them a 
refreshing change of pace, but by 
the time fifth week rolls by, all the 
stresses they thought were gone 
pay them a familiar visi t. It 's 
important no t to forget that school 
isn 't the only cause of stress in stu-
dents' lives, however. There are 
innumerable other factors. For the 
majority, growing up is still a pain 
and remains at the root of emo-
tional problems. 

Already, I've been fortunate 
enough to have a few students 
open up to me in deep ways, 
exposing a side of themselves that 
they would normally hide from 
others. Their problems include 
everything from family abuse to 
high school alienation . What fas-
cinates me is how so many of 
these same people with deep-
seeded issues are the ones we usu-
ally envy. 

They are the ones who always 
seem to get the highest grade on an 
impossible test or appear to be hav-
ing the most fun at a party. They 
are the valedictorians speaking at 
graduation or the select few who 
made up the "in-crowd" in high 
school. 

In short, we never would expect 
these sort of people to have prob-
lems, but they do. As trite as it 
sounds, people who are · success-
ful " are no more resistant to 
emotional suffering than the rest of 
us who aren 't successful. In one

respect. we probably have it easier. 
for at least we have no qualms 
about admitting our frai lties. The 
· successful" ones, on the other 
hand. run a much higher risk of 
damagi ng their reputations as per-
fect people. For them, admi tt ing 
that they have serious problems is 
almost unthinkable. 

So what's the solut ion? T here 
are many opt ions. but the common 
denominator is always common 
sense. It 's something we all learn 
about (one would hope) from 
when we're little: If you haw a 
problem, talk to someone about it. 
Bottling it up and pushing it back 
further and further only perpetu-
ates the problem. Take it from 
someone who has experienced his 
share of bad moments, both first-
hand and from those closest 
around him. 

Dealing with any emotional 
problem head-on feels so much 
better in the long- term than avo id-
ing it for the short-term. In addi-
tion. acting out only seems to mask 
the problem. albeit in a sometimes 
pleasurable way. The bottom line is 
being honest with oneself and 
seeking help to deal with it. if nec-
essary. 

For everyone out there who is 
happy, healthy and content, more 
power to you . As for everyone else. 
keep fighting and always remember 
that you are no t alone. I am 
reminded of what a dear friend 
once told me. It is something I 
won 't soon forget. She sa id. · We're 
all in the same boat, so let's padd le 
together." 

Those were wise words, 
indeed .

cess improve. You'll want to travel 
that day, but it's not a good idea. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday your 
partner comes to your rescue. The 
two of you can fit all the events you 
want to attend into your schedule. 
Your group wants to spend money 
Thursday and Friday. If you lose 
control of the finances, you could 
end up in the hole. Do paperwork 
and errands on Saturday. On 
Sunday travel to investigate some-
thing interesting you've heard 
about. 

'_nil (April 2O-May 20) 
Romance finds a way on 

Monday. You're persistent, so this 
won't be impossible. Improve your 
financial situation Tuesday and 
Wednesday with careful prepara-
tion and a few long-distance phone 
calls. On Thursday and Friday 
expect pressure to cinch the deal. 
Catch an error first. If you're selling 
or giving things away. wait until 
Saturday. Tithe to yourself, too, on 

Sunday. The money you're saving 
provides security sooner than 
expected . 

....... (May 21-June 21) 
Fears that you'll lose are 

unfounded Monday, but pay back 
an old debt. Thereafter, you'll SLlrt 
to see possibi lities. By Wednesday 
you can achieve one. Go ahead; 
take the risk. Pull back on 
Thursday. A new venture then 
won't work as well as hoped. Ditto 
Friday. Curtail travel both days and 
fix broken things instead . Do 
housework Saturday so you can 
invite a favorite friend over Sunday. 
Take care in a game of chance, 
however. The other guy has a trick 
up his sleeve. 

CMcer (June 22-July 22) 
A conversation with your sweet-

heart on Monday leads to new 
. plans. You're eager to Llke action, 

but don't SLlrt until Tuesday. An 
older friend can help with a house-
hold plan Wednesday. Get some-
thing for free that would have cost 
good money. Spend Thursday and 
Friday nights with the ones you 
love. Nothing else is more impor-
tant. Your list spills over into 
Saturday. so be flexible. Turn down 
another inviLltion in favor of fami-
ly. A healthy outdoor exercise is 
great for Sunday, but get back 
home before dark. 

LM (July 23-Aug. 22) 
You may have trouble deciding 

which way to go on Monday. Your 
social and love lives are in compe-
tition. Don't get all tangled up, or 
you'll miss a career opportunity 
Thesday. Study Wednesday and 
flush bugs out of your systems on 
Thursday. You may have to get 

FEATURES 17 

expert help with that job on Friday. 
Dump your trash on Saturday and 
find a treasure in another's dis-
cards. You're in for a pleasant sur-
prise on Sunday . 

VIrP (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
The others don't know what 

they're doing Monday. If you do, 
you have the advantage. Take 
charge and reap the rewards 
Tuesday. You'll work for the money 
on Wednesday, untangling a puz-
zle. Go back to the rule book 
Thursday and Friday. Don 't take 
any chances with that mess. New 
information gives you a new per-
spective Saturday, and that 
improves your odds. Fix your place 
up just the way you want it Sunday. 
Ubra (Sept_ 23-0ct. 23) 

travel's enticing Monday but 
could be fraught with peril. Make a 
phone call instead. The money you 
save will be welcome on Tuesday. 
Go on Wednesday, as far as possi-
ble. Your sweetheart's in a blue 
funk Thursday. Dig deep to help 
bail that one out. On Friday pinch 
pennies to get by and sell some-
thing to bring more Saturday. Or, 
get what you need for free from a 
neighbor. A party with close family 
and friends goes well Sunday. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Financial woes keep you hop-

ping on Monday. You're dancing 
fast to keep everyone happy. Wait 
until Tuesday and Wednesday to 
write the checks. Also, watch for a

price you can afford. Save your 
time and money Thursday and do

Spike Lee Sits for an Interview 
The sometimes controversial director speaks candidly 
By RDECCA CANIU 
Harvard Crimson 

(U-WlRE) CAMBRIDGE, 
Mass. - Interviewing the notori-
ously terse Spike Lee is a daunting 
task in itself. Interviewing Lee 
about a new film that threatens to 
shatter our perception~ of race 
relations and expose all our recent 
·progress" as phony is almost too 
much to handle. After all, 
"Bamboozled," his new film, is 
causing a ruckus all over the 
country as it slowly rolls out into 
theaters, and there's no question 
that it will continue to spark 
debate long after its run is OVU. 

With "Bamboozled: Lee takes 
a look at one of film and televi-
sion's rarest breeds - the black 
television executive. His satire is 
based on the current lack of diver-
sity in Hollywood, where 75 per-
cent of television writers are 
white. And in most cases, the 
minority writers at networks are 
all working on the same show. In 
1999. it was found that ABC 
employed nine black writers - all 
assigned to the same sitcom. 

In order to succeed in his posi-
tion as a black television execu-
tive. Lee's main character delves 
back into the history of blacks on 
screen to revive one of the most 
popular forms of early entertain-
ment: the minstrel. And with the 
minstrel, of course, comes 
Blackface - perhaps the most 
dreaded image in the history of 
American media. 

We had the opportunity to 
meet with Lee at a Boston hotel to 
discuss his newest, and perhaps 
most controversial film , and to 
consider impending reactions. 

The HanJard Crimson: You don't 
shy away from controversy, but 
this film is eliciting even more 
impassioned reactions than most 

of your films. Is there a specific 
incident that prompted you to 
write the screenplay? 

Spike Lee: Not really. There 
are a whole lot of things that 
added to the idea, things that I 
got from watching television, or 
from movies. "Bamboozled" came 
from the ideas [ was having about 
us making a transition from the 
end of this century into the next. 
I've really been disappointed by 
the portrayals. of people of color 
in the media and this seemed like 
an appropriate time to think 
about the direction we're going 
in. 

THC: You could have passed 
off the screenplay to another 
director - Why did you feel you 
were the only one who could tell 
this story? 

SL: I felt it. This was a story 
that I wanted to tell. You know, 
now that I think about it, another 
great thing about being a film 
director is that you have to know 
and you get to know about a lot of 
different things. 

THC: Your films usually have 
tr<?uble getting a studio distribu-
tor. Was it difficult to find a dis-
tributor for this film? 

SL: 1 had more trouble getting 
this .film picked up by a studio 
than any other film. But that's 
expected given the content. 

THC: Are you worried that 
there may be public outcry from 
the black community about the 
content of the film? 

SL: I am sure that there will 
be some criticism. but that has to 
be expected. The content of the 
film will raise some uneasy feel-
ings. but by no means am 1 wor-
ried . I actually think tha t it's 
great that the film ',Yill raise dis-
cussion and I don't mind it being 
the stepping stone to people 
becoming aware of things that 

have been forgotten or ignored. 
There's a lot of ignorance about 
the history of these images. It is a 
movie that makes people sit 
down and talk about what they 
just saw. 1 actually think that it 
needs a second viewing for the 
audience to understand every-
thing. 

THC: But don't you ever worry 
about preaching too much at an 
audience? 

SL: Worried about it? We were 
screaming' to the audience! And 
we loved it. 

THC: This legacy of racism 
also seems to be producing some 
curious side-effects, right? Your 
movie also implies that white peo-
ple are trying to become "more 
black" ... 

SL: History is filled with white 
people who have tried to become 
blacker. Take Elvis Presley -
even today, groups like *Nsync 
and the Backstreet Boys. Culture 
is for everybody, but there is a 
difference between appreciating a 
culture and appropriating a cul-
ture. 

THC: So who is the movie sup-
posed to speak to? To black audi-
ences or white audiences? Or do 
you think that it has a message for 
everybody? 

SL: No question about it, it's 
for everyone to watch. 1 know 
that it's painful at times. but we're 
not making this up. The depths 
of degradation in cartoons, 
movies and television shows, the 
misrepresentation of a people -
it's an American legacy; not just 
in television or movies, but in all 
media. 

THC: Is it possible that the 
hype around the film and the sen-
sationalistic buzz that surrounds 
these images might contribute to

Interview: 
Lee talks about the 
making of "Bamboozled'~ 
their glorification? 

SL: All I can say is that my film 
is definitely not a glorification of 
these images. 

THe: Let's talk about the tech-
nical decisions you made for film-
ing. Why did you choose to use 
digital video and what benefits did 
it bring to the production? 

SL: Considering the small bud-
get for the movie - it cost just 
under $10 million - I thought that 
the Sony VX 1000 worked well and 
was appropriate for the look of the 
film. Digital video made sense aes-
thetically since it's a film about a 
television show - and it also made 
sense practically because it allowed 
us to shoot quickly. 

THe: On a quick shoot, do you 
abide strictly by the script or do 
you allow your actors to improv? 

SL: The way I work, in any film 
that I do there's always some 
improv; there's definitely some in

this film too. 
THe: How did the actors feel 

about blackening up? 
SL: They absolutely, absolutely 

dreaded it. There's no question that 
they felt it was dehumanizing. 
Some of the cast and crew weren't 
familiar with Blackface, actually. 
They didn't know what to feel and 
I could tell that they were just 
dumbfounded. 

THe: Not only are they dealing 
with blackening, but their charac-
ters are "bloody' as well . Are there 
any characters that you feel are 
more despicable than others? 

SL: I would say that all the char-
acters are "bloody." Everyone is 

. equally guilty of something and I 
think it is important to stress that 
everybody is in cahoots. 

THC: If everyone is guilty, then 
isn't that a possible basis for giving 
the film a clear resolution? Why 
did you decide to leave it so open-
ended? 

SL: I firmly believe that it's not 
the artist's job to give the answers 
to racism and I never attempted to 
provide an answer to institutional 
racism. All I know is that in the 
universe I created lin the film],

office. Fingerprinting service are 
also offered. 

"This is a safe campus, but 
crime does happen: Cox said. "We 
get a lot of crime against property. 
A lot of tilnes people leave their 
backpack unattended for a few 
minutes. but that is all it takes for 
it to be stolen. We get one or two 
rapes reported in a year, but obvi-
ously more go unreported. If a sus-
pect is known, it would be just like 
if it happened in the city. Arrests 
will be. and have been made. The 
victim will be taken down to the 
hospital ." 

Cox also recommended some 
sa~ precautions. 

"Don't walk alone at night: he 
said. "If you see something suspi-
cious, don't hesitate to call us. Even 
if it turns out to be nothing, we 
would rather go out there and have 
it to be nothing. Any suspicious 
people you see on campus, give us

people have to pay. 
THe: In "Bamboozled: you're 

not only talking about the history of 
racist media images. but you're also 
commenting on the state of the cur-
rent media landscape. There are 
shows on television today that are 
the subject of your parody, correct? 

SL: There are plenty, and we all 
know what those shows are. My 
film is supposed to reflect that; it is 
an indictment of the people who 
write and accept those shows, 
because we know that they exist 
today. It also has to do with the $1 
million question : What is black? It 
is a never-ending quest for who we 
are. and some people are still in 
search of that. 

THe: So what do you think 
about the "Mantan Show' hitting 
television screens in this decade? 
Could it really take off today? 

SL; Yes. I do. Maybe not a ver-
sion as explicit. but think about it: 
a lot of gangster rap music videos 
are minstrel shows in themselves.

your doors at night, on or off cam-
pus. That's a big thing where peo-
ple go into dorms and steal things. 
It is a safe environment, but crime 
does happen. Everyone should take 
precautions." 

In addition, Cox said there ' is 
always a chance that many crimi-
nals see the campus as a good 
opportunity to commit a crime 
because there are a lot of cars con-
centra ted in small areas. Students 
should always lock their cars. and 
if possible. use devices such as the 
Club and an alarm system in their 
cars and never leave valuables in 
the car.

Subway: 
Despite focus on NYC, 
the Series is still special 
COntInued '"'" ..... ZI 
cial then, and it is nothing special 
now. 

This is the last thing baseball 
needed. 

It is common knowledge that it 
is nearly impossible for a small-
market team to make it to the 
Series. It is like catching lightnin-
hin a bottle every time a team 
such as the Oakland Athletics or 
the San Francisco Giants makes 
it. The people with money are the 
people with players, and they are 
the people with titles. This 
Subway Series just reinforces that 

"I" ( , ~,' (f f J 

Monday, October 23, 2000 

thing like $80 million less than that 
of the Yankees. The Giants have a 
sol id team but are led by their 
coach, Dusty Baker. who can will a 
team to victory. 

Also, a team from anotller part 
of the country could have some 
regional significance. The A's, 
Giants or Mariners would have 
excited the West Coast. The St. 
Louis Cardinals and the Chicago 
White Sox would have done the 
same for the Midwest, and the 
Atlanta Braves could have stirred 
the South. 

Alas, it was not meant to be. 
Instead of a World Series. we have a 

ew York Series. 
There are 'some out there who 

say the Subw'ay Series will turn off 
many a fan . This is true for the 
casual fan , because most people 

notion, with the 
two teams from 
the largest televi-
sion market duk-
ing it out for 
supremacy. 

Another thing I 
cannot stand about 
this beloved 
Subway Series is 
that it just rein-
forces the egos of 
those from the East 
Coast, and New 
York especially. 

Everything in 
this country seems 
to revolve around 
the East Coast and 
particularly New 
York. Sports, poli-
tics, news - you 
name It, the right 
half of the country 
gets first billing. 

There are some out 
there who say the 
Subway Series will 
tum off many a fan. 
This is true for the 
casual fan, because 
most people outside 
of New York cannot 
relate to either team. 
To the pure baseball 
fan, on the other 
hand, a Subway 
Series does not 
matter one bit. 

outside of New 
York cannot relate 
to either team. 

To the purr 
baseball fan, on the 
other hand, a 
Subway Series 
does not matter 
one bit. 

I love baseball. I 
will watch the 
World Series as 
much as my sched-
ule will allow. The 
fact that it is a 
Subway Series 
does not get me 
more exci ted. 

In fact, it turns 
me off a little. but 
not to the point 

th~t I will not 
watch . Baseball IS 
baseball. Period . 

A city that is full of itself already 
is just getting more full of itself. 
This Series isn't about the world, 
North America or even just the 
United States. It is all about two 
burroughs in New York City: 
Queens and the Bronx. 

Baseball desperately needed the 
Seattle Mariners or the A's or the 
Giants to make this Series for two 
reasons: First. it needed a small-
market team to make it to the 
Series, one the average Joe could 
get behind. 

That is what the A's are all about 
- a bunch of guys busting their 
asses off. Their payroll is some-

It looks grim right now with 
the Yanks up 2-0. but there is still 
hope that the Amazin' Mets can 
work some magic at Shea

Subway Series or not.

Senior Amy Kitchen was the 
fourth Triton finisher in 35th over-

The women's team is especially 

outhful this year, as it lost seven

Iso expects the teams to do as well

While pleased with his teams' 
fforts so far, McGihon cites relay

aints draft of 1999: said the 
aints pundits. Four straight 100-
ard rushing games and a 30-yard 

touchdown pass later, Williams is 
proving he is no Ryan Leaf. 

Leaf, by the way, just decided he 
was not going to play this week nor 
next week, either. The thing is, the 
guy did not tell his coach first, but 
instead went first to the media. It's 
like ~ery spoiled brat with a silver 
spoon stuck up his butt got rolled 
ttP into Leaf and sent to Chargers 
for the express purpose of making 
the people of San Diego suffer. Leaf 
is Midas but instead of gold, every-
thing he touches turns to horse 
manure. Dump him, pronto. 

Every great defense has a name, 
the Steel Cunain for instance, so 
instead of calling Warren Sapp and 
the rest of the Bues' defense by 
heir given names we should just 
ename them Sapp's Sackers, or 
ait, here is a better one, They 
ho Get no Support From Their 

Offense. 
They give it their all and are the 

defensive unit that has been 
in a long time. However, 

are on the field for 36

for the Raiders as he only 
six of his first 11 field goals. 
I H()we~ver, he has picked it up, mak-

final two kicks last week, 
40-yarders, including the 
winner. 

Raiders neighbors across 
bay, the once dynastic 49crs, 
now looking oh-so-bombastic. 
take hope Niners fans because 

some of us like to say, ~ery loss 
a 'Vick'tory. Now, if only the 

and Bengals would start 

is a question: Why don't 
Bills start Doug F1utie? The 
is a winner, he won at Boston 

he won in the Canadian 
League, and he won with 

Bills. He took them to the play-
last year where Rob Johnson 

and lost the game, albeit, on 
trick play, but he still lost. 

When Johnson got hurt last 
Flutie brought the Bills back 
. Flutie is the Rudy of the 

he is better than Rudy 
the guy deserves to start -

earned it. 
And finally, my super bowl pre-

diction: The Rams will defeat the 
Dolphins in a laugher, 40-2. You 
gotta give the Dolphins' defense 
something.

5-k Run to Raise Funds 
Chancellor's Challenge will earn money for scholarships 
By TAIT MILUIl 
ASSOCiate Sports Editor 

The fifth annual Chancellor's 
Challenge 5k run will commence 
this Friday at 12:15 p.m. Over 
1,000 participants are expected. 

[n the past, the Challenge has 
been run exclusively on the cross 
co.untry course, but this year 
thmgs are going to change. 

The new route begins by 
RlMAC and takes runners down 
through Marshall college, along 
Library Walk, then back up to the 
start/finish line with only part of 
the race going through the euca-
lyptus grove, the traditional cross 
country haunt. 

The Chancellor's Challenge is 
much more than just a 5k run 
however, and last year it raised 
over $158,000. 

"Right now, it looks like we are 
definitely going to beat last year's 
total of $158,000 and much of 
that is due to Charlie Robbins,· 
said Brian Daly, who is in charge 
of donations and schOlarships for 
this year's race. 

_ Robbins, a former UCSD 
trustee, will match up to $15,000 
in donations and has done the leg 
work behind many of the corpo-
rate sponsorships at this year's 
Challenge, including sponsor-
ships sllch as a $15,000 donation 
from Fisher Scientific and 
$10,000 apiece from Audrey 
Geisel and the Doctor Seuss 
Foundation, and john Moores 
and the San Diego Padres. 

"Charlie has just been terrific 
and we really owe him a big thank 
you,· Daly said. 

All the money that Robbins 
and others have raised goes to two 
scholarships. 

The first is a research scholar-
ship and the second is a commu-
nity service scholarship. 

The research scholarship is 
for students who mentor with a 
teacher and is competitive, 
meaning it is applied for individ-
·ually. 

The community service schol-
arship is for incoming freshmen. 
The freshmen are nominated by 
their high schools for what the 

#This is really a great 
deal for students. You get

plus you get to be a part 
of something that has

'schools perceive to be outstand-
ing service to the community. The 
winners are then picked by 
UCSD. 

Dynes is providing another 
$40,000 dollars in matching 
funds, which comes from unre-
stricted funds that, as chancellor, 
Dynes has control over and can 
spend toward the university as he 
sees fit. 

This makes a total of $55,000 
in matching funds to be provided 
by Dynes and Robbins, and 
assures that this year's Challenge 
will bring in at least $110,000 in 
added need. 

Beyond matChing up to 
$40,000 dollars, Dynes will pro-

vide $25 out of his own pocket for 
every person that beats him . 
However, this is not as easy as it 
may sound, for the Chancellor is 
one tough competitor 

Last year the Chancellor fin-
ished 170th with a time of 23:42, 
a donation of $4,250, but that still 
leaves over 800 people who did 
not have enough in them to beat 
him. 

Ken Grosse, assistant athletic 
director at UCSD, and coordina-
tor of the athletic side of the race, 
says even some of the athletes 
who are competing in the event 
should be worried about Dynes 
beating them. . 

"Chancellor Dynes is out there 
every day running the course and 
getting ready for the event," 
Grosse said. "He is serious about 
this. [ know that the coaches and 
athletes that are competing are 
always saying, 'we've got to beat 
the chancellor,' but they need to 
be carefuL" 

Dynes also has a standing bet 
running with the A.S. president 
such that if the chancellor beats 
him, Doc Khaleghi must wash 
Dynes' car. 

On the other hand, if 
Khaleghi happens to pull out the 
victory over Dynes, the chancel-
lor has to donate funds for an 
A.S. barbecue. 

In addition to the Chancellor's 
Challenge of $25 for every person 
that beats him, professor Frances 
Dynes Hellman is donating $25 
for every woman who beats her, 
and Vice Chancellor of Health 
Sciences Ed Holmes will pay $25 
to every person from Health 
Sciences who beat.s him in the

Swim Team Opens Strong 
at USC Invitational 
Many Tritons finish in the top five 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Staff Writer 

Last weekend the UCSD men's 
and women's swim teams held 
their own against very tough com-
petition at the USC [nvitational at 
McDonald 's Swim Stadium at the 
University of Southern California. 

"[Our team's performance[ was 
very good," said head swim coach 
Scott McGihon. "Especially con-
sideri ng how broken down and 
tired we are." 

The invitational, which began 
on Friday and ended Saturday, 
included teams from UC Berkeley, 
UC San ta Barbara, UC Irvine, 
California State University 
Northridge and Cal State 
Bakersfield. Also competing were 
club teams from Mission Viejo, 
Industry Hills, Irvine and Pasadena. 

"All the teams were very good," 
McGihon said:"There wasn't a sin-
gle team that was a doormat every-
one could step on." 

While the men and women had 
no individual winners, the women 
had severil] finishers in the top five. 

jennifer Watanabe, who was 
named NCAA Swimmer of the 
Year last year as a freshman, led the 
Tritons with top five finishes in 
three events. She placed fifth out of 
38 in the 400-yard individual med-
ley with a time of 4:36.41, fifth out 
of 91 in the 200-¥ard freestyle in 
1 :55.22, and fifth out of 41 in the 
200-yard backstroke in 2:07.34. 

junior Sandra Lopez also swam 
well for UCSD, netting a fourth-
place finish in the 100-yard breast-
stroke with a time of 1 :06.63, and a 
second-place finish in the 200-yard 

breaststroke in a blazing 2:21 .59. 
Along with Watanabe and 

Lopez, junior Lindsey Meeks also 
swam well enough to qualify for 
the NCAA championships. 

The UCSD women had a strong 
showing in the 100-yard freestyle 
competition, with Samantha Wong 
coming in eighth out of 93 
entrants, and Carolyn and Evelyn 
Kwok placmg seventh and ninth, 
respectively. The women's 200-
yard medley relay teams also had a 
strong effort with a fourth-place 
finish and a time of 1 :51 .50. 

The USC relay tcam won the 
event with a time of 1 :47.09. 

On the men's side, sophomore 
Luke Seed stood out for the 
Tritons, earning a ninth-place fin-
ish out of 47 in the 100-yard but-
terfly with a 52.36 and seventh-
place out of 37 in the 100-ya rd 
breaststroke with a time of 58.67. 

McGihon also praised the 
efforts of senior and team capta in 
Rusty jones, who came in 18th in 
the 100-yard backstroke event and 
senior Ryan Wong, who earned 
13th place in the 200-yard back-
stroke. 

"There were some surprisll1g 
efforts," McGihon said . "Espwally

Subway Series 
Not All That 
Grand 

ROBERT FULTON 

H ey, I have an idea. Let's take the greatest event in American sports and 
name it after a run-down , crime-
infested, smelly underground 
train. 

Wait, someone already beat me 
to it. 

What I am talking about, of 
course, is the World Series, which 
has, unfortunately, turned into a 
Subway Series, pitting the New 
York Mets against the New York 
Yankees. 

As far as the two teams being 
from the same city, who really 
cares? 

Back in the heyday of baseball, 
this sort of thing used to happen all 
the time. Either the New York 
Giants or the Brooklyn Dodgers 
would face lhe Yankees for the title. 
A Subway Series was nothing spe-

TAIT MILLER 

S unday marks the midway point for the NFL. Well, at least kind of, as with the bye 
week there is no real midway 
point. This is as close as it gets, so 
it is time to weigh in the surprises 
and disappointments of the sea-
son. 

The Rams look like Coroebus, 
sprinting past all contenders while 
scoring more prolifically than any 
team in history; but will they fall 
dead at the finish like 
Pheidippides, the originator of the 
marathon, yelling with their last 
breath? 

No. 
The Rams will continue their 

march to a second straight Super 
Bowl, and although they will not 
do it undefeated - no team with a 
defense like that could - their 
offense will carry them through. 

Then there is Narcicuss, wait, I 
mean Terrell Owens, dancing on 
the Cowboys star. People 
bemoaned the loss of respect in 
the game when someone would do 
that, desecrate the most holy of 
holies, the home team's logo. 

Hey, if it was anyone else I 
would agree that Davis was out of 
line; but Jerry Jones' Cowboys, the 
leftover remnants of that coifed 
wannabe dandy, Jimmy Johnson? 
Do it again and again Davis and let 
the whole world revel in that 
team's ineptitude.

PORTS 
Cross Country Holds Own 
The Triton men place third, women fourth at CCAA championships 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD cross country team held its own at 
the biggest meet of the year this weekend. 

The Tritons compared their mettle to other 
teams of equal caliber at the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championships in Turlock, 
Calif. this weekend. 

The men finished in third place out of seven 
schools while the women took fourth out of 11 
schools. 

The top men's team was UC Davis, which was 
unstoppable with only 21 points. Second place 
was another team from the North. California State 
University Chico,' which tallied 48 points. 

"They definitely dominated," Ted Van Arsdale 
said. "They have a high standard and good tradi-
tions in both genders. There were some tough 
runners on Saturday, it's just that they were 
tougher. Davis is the class of the Western Region." 

The 1Titons were well behind the top two 
schools, clinching their third place title with 95 
points. Cal State Stanislaus was fourth with 123 
points. 

UCSD's men were led by a number of under-
classmen on the 8,000-meter course. 

The top Triton finisher was freshman Julian 
ahan. Nahan finished 17th in a time of 26:06. 

Right behind Nahan was sophomore teammate 
David Dunbar in 18th in a time of 26:07. The 
third UCSD finisher was junior Jonathan Wong in 
24th with the time 26:26. The fourth Triton was 
sophomore Ana Shapiro i~ 27th with a 26:33. On 
Shapiro's heels was freshman Nik Bringlascm, who 
ran a 26:35 for the 28th spot. 

The overall top men's runner was Davis' Jeff 
Kaiser, who ran the course in 24:53. Davis and 
Chico domina.ted the top' spots, taking the first 
eight positions and 13 of the top 14. 

On the women's side it was a similar story. 
UC Davis dominated, taking the top spot with 

a untouchable 23 points. Second place was Chico 
with 61 points and third saw Cal State Los Angeles 
with 124. 

UCSD was not far behind, placing fourth with 
131 points. Sonoma State was in close pursuit, 
gathering 138 points for fifth place. 

"Some of our women did a terrific job," Van 
Arsdale said.

Women's Volleyball 
Wins a Long One 
Victory against Sonoma State comes after a 
brutal five-game match 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team. headed up the coast in, pur-
suit of a crucial Collegiate 
Conference Athletic Association 
victory and were successful in their 
endeavor, pulling out a victory in 
one of it's most hotly contested 
matches to date. 

Sonoma State University 
proved a worthy challenger, 
which is something that ,I most 
teams are unable to claim as of 

late. 
Sonoma State took the Tritons 

to a full, five-game match at 
Rohnert Park before finally suc-
cumbing to defeat. 

Both came out strong in the 
initial set, and it took extra 
points for Sonoma to take the 
game 17-15. 

This early struggle did little to 
discourage the Thtons, however, as 
they blasted back in the second set 
for.a 15-9 win.
