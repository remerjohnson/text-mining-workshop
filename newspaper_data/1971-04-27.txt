NEWS ANALYSIS 

WASHINGTON D.C. - This city's ninth anti-war 
demonstration since 1965 proved Saturday that there are still 
those who believe visible protest will influence the government 
in its Vietnam war policy. 

As in the past, the crowd was overwhelmingly young, white, 
and peaceful. But a few new touches dubbed the march another 
landmark in the history of this city's demonstrations. 

The most notable difference in this demonstration was the 
mOod of the crowd. As the WASHINGTON POST put it, " it was 
a playful, peaceful crOWd." 

At one end of the march-the elipse in front of the White 
House-as thousands waited for the line to move onto 
Pennsylvania Ave. , there was sporadic chanting of "peace 
now" and picture taking by tourists and demonstrators alike. 

At the other end of the march- in front of the 
Capitol-marchers shopped for the latest buttons and radical 
newspapers as they looked for places to perch as the afternoon 
speakers began their harangue. 

The size of the demonstration, as usual , was disputed by 
march organizers and city policemen. Whether it was 500,000 
or 175,000, it was agreed that the demonstration was bigger 
than anyone had predicted. 

Pensylv.ala Ave. Uapassable 
The demonstration was so large, in fact, that the mile long 

stretch down Pennsylvania Ave. was crowded from one end to 
the other for four hours. The MC at the podium kept repeating, 

"Pennsylvania Ave. is impassable-and they're still coming!" 
Another difference in the demonstration was the noticeable 

contingent of non-young participants. A POST survey of .500 
random marchers turned up 16 per cent who were 30 years of 
age or over. Explained one furniture store proprietor from 
Michigan, " I am a member of the silent majority who isn't 
silent anymore." 
There were many opportunities for the discerning 

photographer. Almost every statue on the Avenue was 
befriended by at least one enterprising demonstrator. The only 
statue to escape companionship was that of Benjamin Franklin 
(maybe because his paunch discouraged any climbers) . 

Too Maay Speeches 
At the Capitol end of the Avenue, one demonstrator waved 

the Vietcong flag from the top of the Civil War Peace 
Monument, which depicts America weeping on the shoulder of 
history. The afternoon program as usual included too many 
speeches. From Representative Bella Abzug (D-NY), the 
irrepressible women's lib matron, to Angela Davis' mother, to 
impressive Vietnam veterans against the war leader John 
Kerry, speakers hammered away at the scene. "End the 
war- now-yesterday, it's not too late." 

While the crowd threw frisbees, smoked pot, drank wine, 
napped, or chatted, words poured forth from huge speakers on 
the west side of the Capitol, facing the Washington Monument. 
The crowd's attention was salvaged, however, by the strings of 
Peter, Paul, and Mary (" Blowin' in the Wind ," ) and Country 
Joe MacDonald (" Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die" ), who led off 
with the familiar " What's that spell?" and cheer. The number 
of amusing vignettes provided good copy for the Sunday 
morning's edition.

in Washington 
Halfway up Pennsylvania Avenue, marchers were cheered 

on by the peace-sign-flashing ballerinas in Welters School of 
Ballet. At the base of Capitol Hill, several members of the 
" International Christian! Youths" raised the "win the 
warÂ·' placards, as 45-year-old Bernard Goodman of New York 
City, cried "Join up, you chickens, you murderers." 

Law EDforcemeat Busy 
The city's 37 different law enforcement agencies kept busy, 

although 9,000 volunteer marshalls, trained by demonstration 
organizers, made their work tolerable. The District of 
Columbia policemen are known for their coolness during such 
events, and took the trouble of renting vans to decrease their 
" visibility' . The official reason, given by police chief Jerry 
Wilson, wasn' t quite the same: " because Avis doesn't rent 
trucks." 

At noon time the Washington Monument grounds and 
Capitol Hill looks like someone had dumped last week's trash 
from a squadron of helicopters over the city. But, true to the 
promises of organizers, the litter was picked up so well that 
only the well-trampled grass remained as a reminder of the 
hundreds of thousands of visitors of the day before. 

The day's activities ended with a 12-hour concert on the 
Monument grounds that distracted campers in 35 degree 
weather. Most demonstrators were gone by Sunday night, but 
others stayed on as the militant people's coalition for peace 
and justice, led by Chicago Seven's defendant Rennie Davis, 
prepared for two weeks at escalating civil disobedience. 

Surely, any Washington resident could admire the marchers 
for at least one advantage over the half million visitors who 
had arrived three weeks earlier to gawk at the cherry 
blossoms: the traffic moved smoothly into and out of the city.

Berkeley Congressman 

Dellums Tours Military Bases 
to Check 61 Living Conditions 

Barbara Simon 
Stoff Writer 

" We are concerned about conditions under 
which GI's live," said Congres man Ronald 
Dellums at a San Diego press conference a week 
ago. The press conference in downtown San 
Diego came as the conclusion to a five day tour 
of military installations. The last visit was 
Friday morning aboard the U.S.S. Cons,.IIa,ion, 
an attack carrier that arrived in San Diego the 
day before. 

Dellums, a freshman congressman from the 
Berkeley area, explained that he didn't want to 
get trapped into writing form letters for 
information about life in the military. " Part of 
the tour was to raise the consciou ness of GI 
rights and we did this through talking with 
GI's," he said. 

Dellum m ntioned v ral major finding

continued. question h a k i , " What is 
mililar e tabli hm nt re pon ibilit for

Dellums point to the corr lation that an 
addict within th militar will likely be an 

addict in the community. "We mu t begin to see 
addicts as medical rather than punitive 
problems" which the military perceive them 
to be, he says. 

A second area of importance for Dellums is 
the adjustment of the military to raci m. " We 
find a disproportionate number of minorities in 
the stockades," he says. In addition, he found 
the majority of poor and minority men in the 
lower ranks. 

From the perspective of education within the 
U.S., Dellums terms the problem of most 
minorities in the infantry as institutional. 
Because of inadequate schools, minorities score 
lower on tests, and therefore enter rank 
positions such ,IS the infantr ,say Dellum . He

UCSD Applicants Face Lottery 
J.H Graham 
Stoff Wriftr 

The UCSD campus is 
attractive. It must be; during 
last November alone, 2.286 high 
school students applied for 
admission. 1,208 lucky ones 
were accepted ; the 1,078 not-
so-fortunate were randomly 
rejected by computer. 

"Why? Why randomly ?" is 
the question asked so 
frequently by irate parents, 
high school counselors, and 
now by the TRITON TIMES. 

" Beca u se , " comes the 
expected answer. Random 
selection is used because it's 
the best of a limited number of 
poor alternatives, indicated 
Ron Bowker of the Admissions 
Office. 

Admissions to this campus 
have been customarily based 
upon date of application, he 
said, but an order [rom the 
President's Office to give equal 
weight to all applications 
received during November has 
made this impossible, Bowker 
explained. â¢ 

Candidates for freshman 
status are asked to list a 
number of alternate UC 
campuses in order of 
preference on their application 
forms. Those not accepted here 
are redirected to the first 
"open" campus they listed. 
usually Santa Barbara or 
Riverside. 

Next Fall it s planned to 
choose half of the incoming 
freshman class on the basis of 
high academic achievement, 
and select the other half 
randomly. The student will 
state his grade point average 
(exclusive of physical 
education courses ) on his 
application ; it is expected that 
3.5 will be the lowest average 
seriously considered for 
selection by achievement. 

The major objection to G P A-
based admission is the lack of 
time available for processing, 
B3wker said. Prospective 
freshmen must be told their 
status by January l5-only 45 
days after the end of 
November . High school 
transcripts are completed only 
up to six semesters at that 
time . An "A" from one high 
school may not be the same as 
an " A" from another . 
Achievement test scores and 
similar factors complicate the 
issue. Finally, a strict reading 
of UC regulations holds that all 
qualified students are eligible : 
there is nothing to support the 
idea that one student may be 
more eligible than another. 

Priority coulfl be given to 
students residing in San Diego. 
it has been suggested , or 
perhaps out-of-state students 
should be barred, Bowker 
noted. But UCSD, he said , is 
already considered too much a 
local school , with 50 percent of

significantly alleviate the

Town (ouncil President States Views on U(SD 
Debbie Montgomery 

StaH Writer 
All of you know how you feel about La Jolla , but how does La 

Jolla feel about you? To obtain a businessman 's view of 
University students, Mr. Albert C. Blatz, president of the La 
Jolla Town Council and vice-president and general manager of 
the Robert F. Driver [nsuranceCo., was interviewed. 

" As a businessman in the area, I feel that UCSD can and will 
be a great asset to our community. I have always felt it should 
be the University of California at La Jolla rather than San 
Diego .. .1 feel it will be undoubtedly oneof the most successful 
learning institutions in the entire Umverslty of Callforma 
overall plan ." . 

Speaking on behalf of the La Jolla Town CounCIl, Blatz 
explained that there is a UCSD committee which acts as liaison 
between the University and La Jolla . This committee 
coordinates the University 's activities, keeping the Town 
Council informed on what is going on at the campus. 

" 1 feel that we have made some great inroads through our 
UCSD committee in understanding the students ' problems anc' 
in working closer together with the University ," he stated. 
"The lecture by Third College Provost Watson at the La Jolla 
High auditorium was , I thought, a point in fact. I felt Dr. 
Watson did an excellent job in answering question's to the 
people of La Jolla." Blatz added that many citizens had no 
conception of what Third College was before Watson 's speech.

OPEISI PM 

Blatz feels the University has cooperated a great deal with 
the Town Council. As an example he mentioned Karl Keating of 
DIMENSION and Craig Starr of the Communications Board, 
both of whom spoke recently at a Town Council meeting. " It 
gave us a better idea of what is going on at the University." He 
also said that with this kind of cooperation, "ooth have to 
benefit. " 

Regarding students, Blatz finds there is " no trouble." He 
believes the " hippie element" is small . " I don 't feel there is 
any problem. There is more cooperation, better relationships 
than ever. From everyone I've talked to who goes to the 
University, the work is so tough , there isn 't much time to 
become hell-raisers. Of course there is a small element, but it 
is well contained. " 

Blatz indicated he is of the opinion that businessmen and 
merchants would like to see more students in La Jolla. To 
accomplish this. he is presently attempting to work with the 
University on finding part-time jobs for students in La Jolla . " I 
would like to see some merchants use available help on a part-
time basis. This would help acclimate students to our village." 

The Town Council would also like more student volunteers to 
participate in events such as the Rough Water Swim and the 
Annual Christmas Parade. 

The key to the whole relationship according to Blatz is 
cooperation. "The closer we La Jollans work with the 
University, the more beneficial it will be for all concerned ." 

" Frankly, if I'were a student and wanted to reside west of 
the Mississippi, I couldn't find a better university on the west 
coast. The school has an excellent library and has a fant1lstic 
location. Our future community leaders will eventually come 
from UCSD, so it behooves La Jollans to reevaluate their 
immediate problems, and for UCSD students to adjust to their 
environment. ..

Tritons Split, Win 3-2;' Lose 7-3 

Diomondmen Looking for 0 .500 Record: 8-10 Now 
The UCSD baseball team will 

have to wait at least another 
week before climaxing their 
belated start and reaching the 
elusive. .500 mark, set in 
January as the minimum goal 
for the season. Hopes were 
high Saturday after little 
Jimmy Robinson frustrated the 
visiting Cal Lutheran 
Kingsmen with his tantalizing 
assortment of slow curves, 
change-ups, and occasional 
moderately fast deliveries , 
sparking the Tritons to a 3-2 
win in the first half of a twin 
bill at the UCSD field. 

For Robbie, a junior from 
Los Angeles, the game was his 
first starting assignment and 
second win against a lone 
defeat. To Cal Lutheran, 
coming off a 3-1 win over USIU 
and boasting two victories over 
powerful La Verne, the defeat 
was its 11th one-ruo loss, 
bringing their record to a 
deceiv!ngly unimpressive 10-17. 
A 4-run outburst in the final 
inning earned the Kingsmen a 
7-3 edge in the night-cap, ended 
the Triton bid for a sweep, and 
lowered UCSD to an 8-10 season 
mark. 

In typical fashion, UCSD 
opened the scoring in the first 
inning of the initial contest and 
jumped to a 1-0 lead. Lead-off 

Dellums Visit â¢.â¢ 

man Curtis Jenkins drew a 
walk, went to second on Dave 
Wright's sacrifice bunt, and 
came home when George 
Horman, batting third in place 
of the injured Steve Shepherd 
( .377) , drove a ground ball 
single through the right side of 
the close Cal Lutheran infield. 
The Tritons increased their 
margin in the fourth inning 
when Horman opened with a 
walk, went to third on Pete 
Yocky's double down the left 
field line, and scored on a 
single by John Shinn. 

With the infield playing 
close, Yocky held when Ron 
Bush hit a sharp grounder to 
Kingsmen thirdbasema~ Steve 
Petalin, who converted the hi t 
into a rapid double play by way 
of 2nd to 1st. Fortunately, 
Yocky scored the 3rd run when 
on the next play, Petalin threw 
wild to first on Chuck Bahde's 
bounder. 

Cal Latlleraa Scores 
1 ill Fiftll 

Cal Lutheran scored its 
initial run in the 5th inning on a 
single infield out which 
advanced the runner to second, 
and another single. The score 
was made easier when arm-

injured catcher Jerry Pittman, 
filling in at first base, deflected 
Ron Bush's attempted put-out 
throw to the plate from right 
field . On the next play, Ron 
ended the inning when he threw 
a perfect strike to Pete Yocky 
to thwart an attempted tag up 
from second. 

A walk and two singles cut 
the Triton lead to 3-2 in the 6th. 
But with only one out and 
runners on 2nd and 3rd, 
Robinson got the next two 
batters to ground out to Yocky. 
Jimmy then ended his mastery 
of the Kingsmen by setting 
them down in order in the final 
inning. 

Left-hander Guy Lowery ran 
into difficulty early in the 
second game, when after 
walking the first batter and 
striking out the next, 'he gave 
up a triple and two singles in 
consecutive order to give Cal 
Lutheran a 2-0 lead. Guy 
quickly settled down, though , 
and until being relieved after 
two consecutive doubles in the 
6th inning, retired the next 9 
batters in succession, and 14 of 
the remaining 16 he faced. The 
6th inning hits, however, were 
enough to put Cal Lutheran in 
front 3-2 after the Tritons had 
tied the count with solo runs in 
the 3rd and 5th . 

A potential big 3rd inning for 
the Tritons resulted in only one 
run due to some faulty base 
running and negligent base 
coaching. After being hit by the 
first pitch of the inning, 
Jenkins (. 281) stole his 16th 
base of the year and went to 
third when Dave Wright (.278 ) 
singled. With Horman (.333 ) at 
bat, Dave attempted a steal of 
2nd, but was tagged out when 
he came into the bag standing 
up, assuming no throw would 
be made. 

Double-Play FiD.Isbes 
TrilODS 

Jenkins scored when 
Horman 's hard grou nder to 
third was bobbled. Yocky (.283 ) 
then lifted a fly to left field and 
proved to be the last Triton 
batter for the inning when 
Horman, thinking there were 
two outs, raced past 2nd before 
realizing his mental error, and 
failed to beat the throw back to 
first. 

In the Triton 5th, singles by 
Jenkins and Wright and a base 
on ba lis to Horman loaded the 
bases with no outs, and 
provided an excellent 
opportuni ty to break the game 
open. However, though 
Jenkins was able to tie the 
score after Yocky's deep fly to

The big inning for the

Crime Increases â¢â¢â¢ 
(continued from page 11 

cOhsidered by the District 
Attorney. 

The to tal value of stolen 
goods from the beginning of the 
fiscal year in July until now is 
$30,000. Torrens said tha t thefts 
are not concentrated. but have 
occurred throughou t the 
UniverSIty. 

On the . 'ligh ter ide of 
crime." Torrens reported that 
a police officer spotted a 
person cultIvatIng a garden in a 
remote sectIon of the campus. 
When the offIcer approached 
the person he threw something 
in a bu h and ran. The officer 
found a rlat 0 marIjuana plants 
in the bush. The canoibis 
farmer escaped 

Torren offered several 
suggestIOns for studeOl to help 
prevent thefts. whIch IS the 
major problem faCing campus 
police. He said that because of 

the number of transients on 
campus, students " have to lock 
their rooms just like in a 
hotel. Â·Â· Torrens suggested that 
students " lock their rooms, 
lock their cars and lock their 
bikes. " 

Control of keys is an 
important factor in cutling 
down on thefts. Torrens said 
that one of the non-students 
arrested for bicycle :l,eft had 
keys to two different dorm 
rooms The police chief said 
that if tudents notice 
sq'a ngers hanging around 
dorm they should r~ort the 
persons to the Resident Dean's 
Offi e as well as the polIce 

Torrens concluded by saYlDg 
hat the IDcrease ID CrIme will 

neces ltate an increase 10 the

He plans to ask for authonty to

The Nocturnal Council 
J ames Clayton Philip Chandler Cindy Mayer 

As most of you have noticed, there is an 
additional election, conducted on the ba"is of 
'plurality, occurring alongside the regular AS 
election, Some students are concerned about the 
feasibility of such a plurality election. What is it 
all about? 

Let us consider the principles characteristic 
of plurality elections. These principles include 
the following : that one should vote for people 
whom he finds, through personal interaction, to 
be qualified as human beings and to have the 
administrative ,capabilities to perform the 
duties of community government; that we the 
people should make our own choice of those 
am.ong ourselves wbo would act as 
humanitarian st'rvants in government; that we 
should not be forced to accept a limited choice 
among self-eertified " leaders" (those wbeeler-
dealers, rugged-individualists, charismatic 
types whose campaigning and politicking 
degrade themselves and insult us all ; that, 
instead, everyone in the UCSD community 
qualifies as a potential candidate; that we 
should not be forced to vote apiJIst the more 
noxious candidates but should be able to vote for 
those we think are good men and women ; that 
we the people should be given the opportunity to 
establish a plurality of perspectives in the 
government, rather than an extreme on the 
right or the left. 

Some have raised the question of block:voting 
by cliques formed for the purpose of electing 
someone to represent their interests. We 
answer that people for too long have 
constructed institutions out of (ear. We appeal 
to people individually to ask themselves how 
they would react if confronted, under this 

system, by a WOUld-be politician soliciting votes 
and, thereby, attempting to screw up a 
potentially beautiful electoral procedure. It's 
about time we stopped thinking about what 
other people are going to do and started 
encouraging them to think for themselves. The 
supporters of plurality trust the honesty of 
individuals. 

The proposed electoral system is for each 
voter to list seven people he honestly believes to 
be qualified, to sign his "ballot" (bring your 
own), and to tum it in at one of the designated 
polling places on campus. The umes wHld not 
be restricted to students: anyone who is a 
worker, faculty or staff member, or who is in 
any other way a part of the UCSD community 
will also be qualified to vote and to be elected. 
The ballots would be tallied and then publicly 
burned.The seven people receiving the most 
votes would be ~Iected , and , if anyone declined 
the post, he who has the next highest total vote 
would be instated. The organization of the 
council itself would be left up to the elected 
representatives. We would suggest that the 
council elect, by majority vote, a chairman and 
a vice-chairman and that all future actions be 
based on unanimous decisions. 

What is the point of electing a government 
with nothing but moral authority ? We believe 
that there will be substantially more support for 
the plurality election truin there will be for the 
regular AS election. If this belief is well-
founded and if this shadow government or 
Nocturnal Council (call it what you will) proves 
through its recommendations to be attuned to 
the needs of the UCSD community, then 
stuqetlts may, in right, demand that it be 
recognized as their legitimate government.

Do Not Tear, Fold, or Mutilate 

Moving right along, folks , we 
were talking about bruises and 
I told you that emergency 
treatment consists of Ice, 
Compression, and Elevation or 
rest. All you have to remember 
is ICE, and the first letters 
stand for the three things to do. 
Isn 't that wonderful? 

Today's lesson begins with 
sprains lwbat's a sprain?). A 
sprain is an injury to a 
ligament caused by 
overstretching it. lwbat's a 
ligament?) A ligament is a 
fibrous band that connects one 
bone with another bone. as in 
" Dem Dry Bones." It is 
distinguished from a tendon, 
which is a sinew that connects 
a muscle to a hone. Now stop 
interrupting! 

The commonest sprain 
occurs on the outer side of the 
foot when you twist your ankle 
inward. The outside ligament is 
overstretched and tears. Pain 
and swelling begin at once 
because there is local bleeding 
inside . The Immediate 
treatment is exactly as for 
bruises : cold, pressure, and 
rest. But ankle sprains are 
trickier than bruises. The 
tearing may be very slight or 
extend all the way across the 
ligament, and sometimes the 
injury is indistinguishable from 
a fractured ankle without x-
ray. So injuries of this sort 
should be checked out by an 
M.D. as soon as possible. The 
really severe sprains may need 
casting or even surgery to 
repair them . Fortunately. the 
vast majority of sprained 
ankle are minor injuries and 
after applying cold for twenty-
four to forty-eight hours to 
control welling, heat i 
applied to speed up healing. 

Strains occur in muscles 

v. Rohert Allen M. D. 
from overuse or over 
stretching . The classic 
example is the " pulled 
muscle." C old is Dot applied, 
but heat, whirlpool treatments , 
hot showers, rest; and aspirin 
all help. 

Muscle spasms are a milder 
variation of strains and are 
very common. For various 
reasons, one or more muscles 
go into a sustained contraction. 
The commonest causes are 
probably chilling of the muscle 
or performing some 
unaccustomed exercise or 
some movement during sleep. 
The treatment consists of 
immediate squeezing o( the 
muscle to help break the 
spasm, followed by heat, and 
analgesics , rest , and 
sometimes, muscle -relaxant 
medication. The muscle should 
not be massaged. Active 
exercise is permitted as soon 
as the pain is gone . 

What with summer coming 
and people getting out and 
exercising more, I thought this 
information might be helpful. 
Have fun , but survive, please. 

Questions for M.D. RAP may 
be dropped in the box at the 
Student Health Center. 

SUS Note: If you would like 
to discuss personally any 
aspect of health, such as food , 
diseases, exercise, drugs, life 
styles , growth and 
development, sex, or medical 
folklore, you are most cordially 
invited to come and see me. I 
can 't promise to have an 
answer for everything, of 
course, but I'll be glad to give 
you my professional opinion on 
the basis of current medical 
thinking, or I'll try to help you 
find an answer . 

Just call Mrs. Rose Gardner 
at 1346 so that a time can be set 
up when we can get together.

Drama Deportment Witch Hunt 
Barbara Siman 
Stafl Writ.r 

The CRUCIBLE, a play by Arthur Miller, 
concerns " literally the very core of one 's 
freedom ," says Drama professor Eric 
Christmas. Nineteen UCSD Drama students are 
now rehearsing the play for production which 
will begin May 1. 

Witch trials set in late 17th Century Salem. 
Massachusetts are the subject of The 
CRUCIBLE. In the written publication of the 
play, Arthur Miller states that " the play is not 
history in the sense in which the word is used by 
the academic historian." 

Miller continues that dramatic purposes have 
sometimes required many characters to be 
fused into one. He tells the reader that "the fate 
of each character is exactly that of his 
historical model, and there is no one in the 
drama who did not play a similar. . .role in 
history. " 

In discussing reasons for choosing the 
CRUCIBLE, Eric Christmas says that it 
"applies to all times, and that is why it is a jolly 
good play ." There is always a wi tch hunt of 
some ki nd going on, Christmas conti nu es. 

Several major points in the play which 
Christmas mentIOns are the " wrong of guilt by 
as ociation . and the con equences of blanket 
opimon of majority rule .~' The lalter point is 
more blatant in the play. as individuals are 
termed witches becau e of their association 
with other labeled Witches . 

Majority rule is more subtly displayed 
through the word of the judge magi trate and 
mini ters who assume to peak for the people 

of Salem. A few people in power make life and 
death decisions about a considerable number of 
citizens. 

Irony of the witchhunts surfaces when the 
court demands a confession of all the accused, 
in order that their lives be saved. If the accused 
citizens do not confess to being witches, or to 
seeing the devil, they hang. 

Fortunately, the search took the Hut - migbty testimony to p.m.

Christmas explains that for a while ' 'we didn ', 
even know if we were a department " . When it 
was decided to go ahead with the CRUCIBLE, 
the only available room was lecture hall 1330 in 
Muir Bldg. 20 . 

" The faci li ties are not completely workable," 
says Christmas. That is why he had to find a 
play that " has litlle or no problems of staging." 

Another advantage to the CRUCIBLE is that 
it has very good pa rts for both boys and girls. 
Chri tmas adds. "Everybody gets a good break 
. .it I a com pany play ." 
Performance dates for the play are May 1-2,

Wrapping Up the Opera Season 
Arts Wri;er 

Larry Johnson 

The American comes, and for hIs own selfish purposes, 
, deceives the trusting Asian. The American takes what he 

wants, and in the end he leaves behind a yellow corpse. Sounds 
like an SOS version of the latest news from Vietnam? Be the 
similarity as it may , this is Puccini 's "Madame Butterfly," 
recently appearing at the Civic Theater. 

Butterfly was portrayed by the talented Black American 
soprano Felecia Weathers, and portrayed very well . Miss 
Weathers ' voice is rich and sufficiently powerful , and its vocal 
quality is well-suited to this, one of her best roles. 
Furthermore, Miss Weathers' acting ability was quite equal to 
the task of portraying this nobly tragic , fragile little butterfly-
girl. My only criticism would be that she minced too much in 
Act I. but overdoing that was a minor flaw . Both vocally and 
dramatically she was equaito the ever increasing force of th 
opera. 

but his cellulose content was not high compared to that of most 
of the current crop of tenors . Why is it that it 's generally the 
tenors who have the acting problems? 

Marlena Kleinman was a stand-out as Suzuki , Butterfly's 
maid and loyal friend . A sensitive actress, she was excellent 
dramatic support, and did a good job vocally. Not only was she 
able in those capacities, she dealt well with the difficult job of 
handling (on stage) the child who played the son of Butterfly 
and Pinkerton. Handling very young children and seeing that 
they do what they should, is no child 's play. 

John Dunlap as Sharpless, the quite decent but helpless 
American counsel rounded out the major parts . His acting was 
up to snuff, but alone among the majors, his voice was weak . It 
did have redeeming tonal qualities, however. 

As a lilling concluslOD to Mayday aDd tbe 
Rites of Spring, tbe A Pro,ram Board is sponsoring a concert 
witb Je e Davi (pictured above) and Dan Hicks and His Hot 
Licks. Tbe concert will be in tbe gym tbis Saturday nigbt May 
I, at 8:38. UCSD student tickets life $1, and are now on sale In 
tbe Urey Hall Box Office. 

The soprano and the tenor are usually the central roles , but 
in this opera the tenor i ~ less important. The horrid Ii ttle Lt. 
Pinkerton, who betrays poor little Butterfly, is absent for mo t 
of the opera while the girl loyally waits for him. (As in most 
sentimental Italian opera, Puccini pulls out all the slops, 
making the situation as pathetic as po~sible . Fair enough. this 
makes for good music . ' The tenor, Chris Lathonas, was 
vocally quite adequate for his role. He wa somewhat wooden, 

"One Fine Day" and the humming chorus' are the most 
musically memorable portion of the Opera . The orchestra was 
equal to the occasion there, and all the way through. The 
chorus did extremely well on the humming chorus, which was 
rather better than their usual performance. On the part of the 
chorus and orchestra, this was one of their best efforts . Miss 
Weathers hone in "One Fine Day" and in the tragic 
conclusion. 

The set, by Ming Cho Lee, was excellent and authentic , 
capturing the flavor superbly . The oriental costumes were 
pretty good and very colorful , though Pinkerton 's dress whites 
were comically baggy. All in all it was one of their better 
efforts, and a very rewarding el(ening. ('II look forward to the 
next ason.
