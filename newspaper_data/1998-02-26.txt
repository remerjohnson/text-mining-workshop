Immersion Classes Best 
To Teach Children English 

Ron Unz, the creator of Propos it ion 227 , lOok part 
in lin informal qucsti on-and-answt:r ~ess ion on his 
" Engli sh for the Children" proposal last T hu rsday. 

Proposition 227 would require all California pub-
lic school instructi on to be conducted in Engli sh. 
Non-English speaking studen ts would be placed in 
year- long English i mmersion classe~ . T he propos i-
ti on al so slates $50 mi Ilion per year to create free 
English classes for adult immigrants, prov ided thut 
the adults in turn tutor children in thcir respecti ve 
communiti es in Engli sh. 

Bilingual education in Ca li'forni a so far has been a 
di saster. Instead of gaining a sound speaking and 
writing ability in both English and Spanish, bilin-
guall y educated students gradu i:l te with minimal writ -
ing skill s in both languages. 

Th is is unacceptable, because know ing multiple 
languages is without a douht a necessity in our 
increas ingly internati onal workplace. 

Hopefull y, Propos ition 227 will bring attenti on t 
the miserabl e state o f bilingual cducati on in 
Ca li forni a. We welcome the increased focus that 
Propos ition 227 will bring, and we hope that Unz and 
other reformer~ will reali ze that fluency in multiple 
languages wi II gear Ca li rorni a for a smooth transiti on 
into the 21 st century. 

Regents' Proposal Needs 
Work Before Approval 

T he fallout from the UC Board of Regents' decision 
to ban the usc of aflirmati vc-acti on criteria in admis-
sions has produced a bevy of proposals. One of thL:m, 
which would admit to the UC system the tor 4 rercent 
of each California high schoo l grad uat ing c l a~~, has 
great r otential. Still , thL: plan nCL:ds IlllJ('e work . 

T he proposal, disc li ssed by the regent!'. last wL:ek, 
has the potentia l to draw students from 50 high 
schools that do not cllrrcntl y send any gradua t i ng 
seni ors to the UC ~ys te ll1 . The greater e posure 10 the 
un iversity may spu r high sc hoo ls to urfer murL: "A -F' 
cla~ses in h ope~ or ~cnding more students to UC 
schoob. 

Thi s proposal is IL:Hps Li nd bounds ahead or the 
lud i c ro Ll ~ pl an Ca li forni a Sell . Teresa Il u g h e~, D- Lo~ 
Ange l e ~, tic iscd to automulically admit the tOP 12.5 
pcrcent of each high schoo l 's graduating cl ass to the 
U system. Hughes ' plan would then shut out the 
bottom 87.5 percent from the uni versity. 

In comparison, the 4-percellt proposa l would com-
plement ex isting UC admissions standards. 

T he concern Regent s Roy Brophy and Sue 
Johnson voiced about the qualit y of the students 
admitted under this plan has some merit They would 
have to meet some undermined academic criteri a, 
which must be dett:rmint:d before thi s plan can be 
fully endorsed.

COMMENTARY: When it ome to creating rule in the apartment, guys and girls have two very different idea 
girl s in sist that everything, from the floor to the toilet to the hower, i cleaned, while guys couldn ' t care less 

PART Two: GUYS AND GIRLS CLEAN Up THE BATHROOM 
By Mark Smith 
Staff Writer 

You found it - the re~t of my 
art icle, which oegan in the Monuay 

i~,uc of the Gllardilill . 1\, 
promised. herl.: is enli ghtenme nt on 
the slIhject of the difTerent rllb, I 
have found that gll Ys and girls have 
agreed to li ve hy. 
3. Rules-Selecti on Process 
Guys: 

The gllYs kn ow that to live hap-
pily, we must find ru les on which 
we agree. To ag ree on them means 
that we all say we like the rull.! . 
Guys will invariahly agree that we 
must onl y pee ncar the toi let. We 
also wi ll agree to pay the rent each 
month so that we can keep li ving at 
our apa rt men t. That is all. 
Gills: 

Girls again follow the same gen-
eral format at the hcginning of the 
rules-selec ti on process. T hey also 
try to lind ru les upon which they al l 
agrce. Their fi rst rll lc, however, is a 
lillie different from the guys' lirst 
rule. Guys find it prclly strange, hut 
girls will not , pecifically agree tll 
pee ncar the toilet. Instead, they 
co ncent rate on a list of more 
length y ru les. 

Girls have invented these thi ng~ 

c all ~d "chores." They accomp lish 
thesl.: e hore~ all what ,omc{)f them 
have uescrihcd as a "rotating 
schedul .:." 

Thci r Ii rst chore focuses on the 
toilet. Girls will actu ally ckan the 
toi k t on the average of once a 
we.:k . Guy, cannOl understand why 
anybody would clean somethi ng 
that thl' arc just going to pee on, 
but girl s insist on c leaning the toi-
let. 

As the next item, girls will agree 
that clean ing the noms should be a 
chore. When asked why, they can't 
come up wit h a de fi ni tc reason. 
They say that it is "c lean" 10 clean 
the 11 001'. 

Howevcr, cleaning for the sake 
of cleanliness escapes the mind of 
the guy, es pecia lly in the case of 
floors. GlI Ys can' t sec why anyonc 
wou ld c lean someth ing that they 
arc just going to walk on, hllt girls 
insist on cleaning the fl oors . 

Another typical chore girl s will 
agree upon is cleaning the shower. 
Agai n, when ask.:d why, they , ay 
that it 's "sanitary" to d ean the 
showcr. "Sanitary" means clean . 

Guys also see th is as clea ning 
li) r the sake of ckaning. In the casc 
of the shower, guys can't see why

As the next Item, 
girls will agree that 
cleaning the floors 
should be a chore. 
When asked why, 
they can't come up 
with a definite 
reason. They say 
that it is "clean" to 
clean the floor. 
anyone wo uld clean ,o llleth ing that 
they arc just going to wa~h di rt 
into, but girl s also insist on clcan-
i ng t he ,how.:!'. 

There is one la, t ru k I will men-
ti on UpOIl which gllYS and gi rls uif-

fer. As I said be fo re, guys wi II each 
pay their portion of the rent each 
month hecau'ie thi s lI1.:ans tha t they 
get tn continue li ving aI the apart -
ment. Girl s. on the nthcr hand. find 
a mme elahorate paymcnt mclhod. 

Often, girl s will have Illore than 
t h.: nUlllher of i'<:malt:s a lIowed, or 
even so metimes a guy, living at 
thci r apa rtment when the landlord 
prohihits extra tcnants. What they 
will do in this case i ~ .-~ha t the e~ t ra 
I ~rso n wi ll actually write a .:heck 
10 one of the girls, who will write 
an extra big check and give that tn 
thl.: landlord wi th the othl.: r sma ller 
checks fro m her other roommates. 
This way, the nu mber of l:i1el:ks the 
landlord receives matches the nllm-
her of all owed tenants in his apart -
Ill l! nt. 

La ndlords are not that stupid. 
They know th at one of the rooms in 
their apartmcnt is not worth $600 a 
month if the other three rooms arc 
w() I1 h $300. The landlord knows 
that therl.: is an ex tra person li ving 
there, hut he doesn' t care heclluse 
hc ge ts $ 1500 a month and hi s tl.: n-
ant, arc females. As long as they 
an; females , he helieves, nothing 
can go wrong becau ,e the clean 
stull Yet, g i rl ~ insist on thi s strange 

check-writing hehavior. 
Alt hough thi s is an admi lledly 

incomplete list of "chores" girb 
agr.:e to perform , it ~ hows t hl' gen-
eral di ll erenc.: hetween guys and 
girl s in the ruks-se lection prnces~ . 

So whi le we studenls an: pick-
ing out roommates and an apart -
Illcnt for n~x t year. we wi II now 
have options in th~ se il:ctio n 
processes we find most ad.:quate 
- the "guy" way 01 the "girl" way. 

Thi s Yl.:ar, I' ve heen a lillie 
hored. I think I' m going 10 try the 
gi rls' way of li nding roo mmates. I 
wondcr whom I can recruit 10 he

labor Day' at Old Globe 
Apple-Pie-American family has a bitter taste 

By Ilona Fass 
Co·Hiatus Editor 

Director A.R. Gurney 's newest play, 
"Labor Day," starl s off s lowl y, gains 
momenlUm toward the middle, hut ulti -
mately loses ground and spins oul of con-
trol. 

The main plot centers around John 
(Joseph Sommer), II rather and playwri ght 
who has become ove rly sentimental ever 
sinc.:e his canc.:er went into remiss ion. 

Although the play he has just wrillen is 
about to be snat c.:hed up by Broadway, it has 
one Ilaw: an ending so sticky-sweet, every-
one who reads it wants to throw up. 

But the play is meant to de lve deeper 
than its surface presentation. 

"It's a mi c.:roc.:osm of what happens on a 
dail y basis," says Veannc Cox, who plays 
John 's daughter Ginny. "It 's like looking 
through a paper plate with a pinhole through 
it at the eclipse." 

Regretfully, there arc not enough scenes 
with John 's two childl en, Ginny and Ralph 
(Cox and James Colby, respectively), and 
Dennis, the director who pushes John to 
change the play's corny ending (Brooks 
~ Ashmanskas). . 

"Labor Day" is loosely modeled after 
Gurney's other works, which include "Love 
Lellers" and "The Cocktail Hour." 

"Labor Day" runs through March 15 at 
the Old Globe Theatre. Call 23 ':1-2255 ror 
information.

JSe{ret Garden' too Sweet 
Childrens story wins kudos with senior-citizen crowd 

By Adam Vadnais 
Guardian Reporter 

It 's not that "The Secret Garden," per-
forming at the Lamb's Player Theatre in 
Coronado, is a poor produ~tion . The acting 
is well ·done, the singing is excellent and the 
costumes are, well". neal. 

The average age of an audience is about 
60. Now, these 6O-year-olds have a wonder-
fultime, and it truly is a great plnce for them 
to bring their grandkids. 

Unfortunately, this production of wrhe 
Secret Garden" is saccharine-sweet , overly 
sterile and just plain dull. What makes it 
worse is that the lIIusic is almost a parody of 
itself. One , an allllost predi~ t at which poi nt 
in conversation a character will suddenl y 

break inlo song. 
To its credit, "The Secret Garden" is a 

Tony Award-winning pl ay (1991 's Bes t 
Book for a Musica l), and Director Robert 
Smyth takes care to not tarnish its charac-
ters. At some points, though, one just wi sh-
es that Smyth would have done something 
more creative with it. 

It would be unfair, however. not to give 
some praise to the actors. Lead actress Tania 
Henetz docs an exce llent job of keeping her 
character of Mary Lennox sympathetic, yet 
with a touch of braUi shness. Bix Beuwy 
also dese rves credit for livening up the per-
form ance of Colin Craven. 

'The Secret Garden" runs through March 
15. Call 437-0600 for more information.

EVERCLEAR: 
Having orne good,

Continued from page 9 
"Elel'tra Made Me Blind," both 
punk-funk , post-g rungO! staples 
from Sparkle alld Fade, a. well as 
"Nervous & WO!ird" from Ever· 
c lea r's debut , World of (Jist' 
(Capitol, 1993), were highl ights of 
the most clTcctive pari of Ihc scI.

The hand ra n th rough three cut s 
ofr 5ilarltle allll Fade , including the 
gri ef-till ed hut sent imentally-o pti -
mistic "Strawherry" and "Summer-
land." Both songs deat with Alex -
akis' drug addicti on and hroken-
home childhood. 

Eve rclear conc luded the 
acoustic set with a rather weak ver-
sion of "Heart spark Dollarsign," a 
song simply posing the question, 
" What's wrong with interrac ial 
re lationships"" 

While the lirs! two songs were 
heart-felt and touched the audi -
ence, the acoustic version of the 
last song dragged and lacked the 
enthusiasm of the lirst half of the 
band 's scI. 

Not to disappoint th; crowd, 
Everclear plugged hack in aga in 
and ran through anot her larger set, 
including the current single "I Will 
Buy You A ew Life" fro m After-
glow, a ,ong Alexaki s dedica ted to 
cvery man who wou ld "do 
ahso lulcly anything" for th e girl he 
loves.

14 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD Sports Clubs 
RUGBY 
If Arnold Schwarzenegger was 

as.ked to describe the UCSD men's 
rugby team. he would undoubtedly 
say, "Here me now and believe me 
later. dis team is gooood." 

After its 62-0 Saturday trounc-
ing of league-opponent USC, 
UCSD recorded its third consecu-
tive shutout. On top of that , the 
ruggers have now outscored thei r 
league opponents by a 10lal score 
of 157-0, a lofty achievement. 

"These first few vklories have 
served as good learning tools for 
us," Coach Eric Takeuchi said. 
"Despite our large margins of vic-
tory, I think this squad has some 
way to go before they truly reach 
their full potential ." 

On Saturday, a rocky, uneven 
Griffith Park field couldn ' t slow 
down the Tritons. whose mighty 
defense kept USC off the score-
board. The ruggers got on the board 
early when sophomore Luke Arm-
strong scored a try. Unfonunately, 
he was sidelined later with a ham-
string injury. 

Armstrong's replacement , rook-
ie Joe "Bam Barn" Schmitz, scored 
upon entering the game and made 
several tackles defen ively as well. 

Fellow rookie Bobby "/ceman" 
Carrara played a good game in his 
first start at the forward posi tion, 
while forward Roger Dewames led 
UCSD to a victory behind his 
intimidating death threats. 

Adding to the high-octane scor-
ing dri ve of UCSD was Darren 
"WolI" Garb, who stood out on 
o lTense with 2 scores. Vil.:tor 
"Rico" Erenberg, ourtncy "Pony 
Boy" Geigle and Davud "0" Kar-
bassioun all added tries of their 
own to drive up the total score 
before the day was over. ' . 

"We could probably beat the 
Wales nationaltcam," Karbassioun 
sa id after the game. 

UCSD's next game is Sat., Feb. 
2& agai nst league-ri val Claremont 
McKenna College. 

"If we playas well as we've 
been playing, we shou ld have no 
problems agai nst Claremont 
MI.: Kenna," Schmitz said.

ICE HOCKEY 
The UCSD ice hockey team 

accomplished a feat that not even 
the U.S. Olympic team could besl 
- it has won a couple games. 

Coming off a 6-2 defeat at the 
hands of Fresno State University 
Ihe night before, the pucksters from 
La l a lla mashed Santa Clara Uni -
versity by the count of 8-2 las t Sat -
urday. 

Justi n Millard led UCSO in 
scoring with 2 goa ls and Roh 
McHenry notched his lir~t -ever to 
highl ight the victory. 

The road trip up north ended in 

a split , but co-captai n Derek Stai n-
er remained upbea t about hi s 
team 's playoff chances after the 
trip to Northern California . 

"The road trip has put us into a 
very good hut tough situation," 
Stai ner sa id. "I'm figuring 3-1 in 
our last fo ur should hopefully be 
enough but we need some help 
from the crowd ." . 

Don't tell that to the 75 specta-
tors who braved the dreaded beast 
they call EI Nino to witness UCSD 
ice- hodey history on Feb. 13. 

For the tirst time in three years. 
UCSD ral.:ked up double digi ts in 
goals as it Ilogged San Jose State, 
10-0. The men began the match as 
they would end it, with Millard 
scoring otT an assist from 
Lawrence Chan en route to a 4-
point night. 

As SJSU was doing its best imi ~ 
tation of Casper the Friendly Ghost , 
UCSD was busy covering the ice 
with Spartan blood. 

The Tri tons jumped out to a 5-0 
lead after the first period and never 
looked back.

How's Hawaii, Tritons? 
SUN: UCSD played two matches against the Rainbows on the islands 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Four days in Hawaii ! Sounds 
more like a Club Med val.:ation 
than an ath letic eXl.:ursion. Last 

well . 
"The conditioning was hell ," 

sophomore Megan Wallis said. 
"Three hours a day of pral.:tice 
plus games at night; it was like a 

Wednesday, the UCSD 
women's water polo 
team departed fo r the 
islands to frolic in warm 
water and to face the 
Uni versity of Hawaii in a 
four-day, two-game sun-
bathing extravaganza. No 
Club Med, but it certai n-
ly sufticed for a nice get-
away. 

_.~~ mini hell-week." 

goa l, with 26, compared to 
UCSD's 16, a stati stic that is typ-
ically indicati ve of the outcome 
of a game. Sophomore goa lie 
Muryam Hadiashar played we ll , 
though, wi th 10 saves in the 
game. 

While the dedicated students of 
UCSD were hraving the el ement ~ 
here in not-so-sunny La Jo ll a, the 
Tri ton women were pray ing to Ra. 
the sun god, and playing a few 
water polo games mixed in spo-
radically for good measure. 

In actuality, despite voyaging 
to one of the more beautiful places 
in the world , UCSD's stay was not 
entirely fun and games as it suf-
fered defeats in hoth contests. 

It also included such unpleas-
antries as daily three-hour pral.:-
ti l.:es in the morning with games in 
the evening. Head Coach Denny 
·Harper. no doubt. had more than 
just a little fun in the sun on his 
mind when he planned this trip. 

Although Harper could not 
make the tri p due to prior commit -
ments, his assistant coac h. Larry 
Sanders, took it upon himself to 
see to it thnt the Il:alll conditioned 

series. 

UCSO took its No. 9 
ranking to Hawaii to 
match up agai nst the 
Wa!tine of the Uni versit y 
of Hawai i. Despite not 
bei ng ranked, Hawai i 
showed signs of havi ng a 
very talented squad early 
on in the two-match 

Coming into the first game. 
Hawaii toted the lofty achieve-
ment of hav ing defeated two top 
10 teams in its previous twO 
games (Feb. 14 vs . USC, ?-4 in 
01'; . Feb. i 5 vs . UCS B, 6-5). 
Climbing aboard the momentum 
locomoti ve, the Rainbows waltzed 
right over tlTe Tritons in their first 
match, 14-6. 

The Tritons spread the scoring 
out with six players scoring I goa l 
apiece; freshmen Hilary Smith, 
Sandra Lopez, Nora Salem and 
Jocelyn Torn as well as sopho-
mores Angie Kondrat and Dara 
Burch. 

Hawa ii scored in spurts, play-
ing a more physical game than 
UCSD that was rellccted by it s 
receiving six more ejections than 
the Tritons (Hawaii had 12 ejec-
ti ons; UCSD had 6). In addition, 
the Rainhows had more shots on 

Amidst condit ioning and visits 
to surf competitions to check out 
the massi ve waves, UCSO found 
time to fit in another game with 
Hawaii on Saturday. This game 
was much closer. although the Tri-
tons fell, 9-4. 

Once again Hawaii had far 
more shot attempts (25) than 
UCSD (13) in the game. 

In scori ng 3 goa ls for UCSD. 
Smi th continued her phenomenal 
play in her lirst coll ege water polo 
season. Refusing to allow onl y 
one UCSD player to score in the 
game, Kondrat took it upon her-
self to score the last goal for the 
Tritons in the stan of the fourth 
quaner. In the game, Hadiashar 
had 8 saves. 

"Our first game we played well 
in the first quarter," Hadi ashar 
sa id , "but,our defense broke down 
t he rest of the game. In the second 
game, we were really strong, but it 
was a matter of converting on our 
six-on-fives which we didn' t do." 

With newly added suntans and 
their bags pal.:ked, the Tritons 
ret urT)ed home Sunday for a week 
of practil.:e before hilling the road 
for the UC Saota Barbara In vi ta-
ti onal thi s weekend. 

Some of the Smartest 
People Get Used

FRUITION: 
UCSD's hard work 
is starting to payoff 
Continued from page 16 
that of Neal O'Brien, who won the 
5.000-meters. 

"Both of those two guys took 
charge of thei r race and won," Van 
Arsdale said. ''They wai ted for the 
right time to strike, a true sign of 
the patience and confidenl.:e 
they've developed." 

Another fine performance Sat-
urday was that of Nico le 
Rodriguez, who won the 400-meter 
hurdles during her first time (;om-
peting in the event. 

"N icole gave an outstanding 
performance," Van Arsdale said. 
"She won the race in the last 40 

SPLIT: 
The Tritons nearly 
swept the Toreros

more runs on 2 more Triton errors. 

UCSO tried valiantly to score in 
the bottom of the seventh, but a bad 
foul ball call on a bunt killed its 
rally and USD took game two 'by 
the linal score of 5-2. 

"Defensively. we were just ran-
tasti c out there," Head Coach Patty 
Gcrckens said. "Erin Bridges did a 
great job at short stop and Sara Sny-
der was just a rock behind the plate. 
In the lirst game, Alli son was great. 
She had all of them guessing. just 
guessi ng. I was very happy at the 
way we played but I also know we 
can do bcth.:r."

melers to beat one of the best run-
ners in the country at that event. 
She is a tremendous talent." 

Van Arsdale does not attribute 
the early-season successes of hi s 
team entirely to athleticism, how-
cver. 

"Skill can make one an athlete," 
Van Arsdale said. "But it is drive 
that makes him or her successful. 
Some people have a lot of talent 
but no drive; they do not try to 
max imi ze thei r potential. These 
kids showed a lot of drive [Satur-
day] . It usually takes three or four 
meets for our athletes to tind their 
rhyt hm f9r the season, these kids 
are right now hitting their stride." 

The track and field team heads

outlook for the future. Gerckens

corne out and practice, that's what 
we' re thinking about and every 
time we step onto the field, that 's 
what we' re thinking about. You can 
sec it in their eyes, they want it and 
they want it for each other which is 
really the most imponant thing"

of fresh-c ut grass and new

ow 1 know Ihat Ihere is a

who arc saying, " Basehall 
sut.: ks. II 's 100 slow, it 's hardl y 
athleti t.:, it 's not int e re~ lin g 
enough and a ft er the st ri ke I just 
stopped watt.: hing it. " 

That 's a load of Nagano! 
Basehall is an allIaling 

game. I t.: an ' t even beg in to 
desc rihe it s intricat.: ies, anti at

In an age wher ' the greedy ath-

One must be thinking ahou t 
which base to th row to with one

hetween a pull hiller and a dead-

whi t.: h pitt.:h to th row to a t.:ertain

list goes on and on. 

But at tbe same time it takes 
a remarkable amount of tough-

and get low to st.:oop grounders

Hitting alone takes a tremen-

side, we had some 35 per-

Among those that 
shined on aturday were 
the men's javelin throw-

Seefe ld and M"lI Trcg idga all set 
personal records. ot to he over-

"Dan is rea lly fl ying with the
