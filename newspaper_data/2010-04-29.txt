SUNDAYSATURDAY

Tucked away behind the concrete facade of UCSD’s exterior, there runs an extensive series of commit-tees — small, isolated groups of administrators, 
faculty members and students charged with drafting the 
intricate policies that dictate how this campus is run. 
Meal plans, shuttle routes, housing costs and on-campus 
speech rights are just a few of the areas governed by these 
committees — all subject to the whims and judgment of 
the individuals selected to serve therein.  

The student component of this arrangement, how-
ever, may not be functioning the way it is supposed to, 
according to various administrators and members of stu-
dent government. They claim there is a troubling lack of 
interaction between the students chosen to serve on these 
committees and the A.S. Council — the body responsible 
for appointing and overseeing these representatives. 

“Unfortunately — and this has been a recurring prob-
lem year after year — we don’t have very good commu-
nication with our representatives,” A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta said. “We don’t know if our representatives even go 
to their committee meetings, and we don’t know if these 
committees — which are actually mostly advisory in 
nature — are even meeting. This is really due to the fact 
that A.S. Council, for the most part, has not performed 
well in reaching out and communicating with representa-
tives after they have been appointed.”

The issue of accountability among campuswide com-
mittees has been popping up more and more lately. 

Students, admin. allege patchy 
attendance, poor communication.

At a meeting of the UCSD Academic Senate 
on April 27, faculty members defended the 
university’s admissions policy, denying claims 
by the UC Board of Regents that the policy fails 
to create a racially diverse student population. 

The regents, including UC President Mark 
G. Yudof, criticized UCSD’s comprehensive-
review system during a meeting in March, sug-
gesting that the system works against attempts 

to admit more underrepresented minority stu-
dents to the campus. The regents’ assessment 
came shortly after a series of racist incidents at 
UCSD prompted questions about how to build 
a more diverse student body. 

“We got lambasted by all the regents and the 
president, and the assumption is that by fixing 
our admissions policy, it will fix campus climate 
and the number of underrepresented minorities 
on campus,” Academic Senate Chair William 
Hodgkiss said. 

Committee on Admissions Chair John 
Eggers compared UCSD’s comprehensive 
review to the holistic review system employed 
by UC Berkeley and UCLA. Comprehensive 
review gives specific point allocations to 
factors such as academic achievements — 
which constitutes 74 percent of the total 

score — personal hardship and educational 
environment. Applicants are then ranked 
and admitted based on whether they make 
the cutoff score. However, in holistic review, 
applicants are evaluated overall with no spe-
cific weight given to any one factor. Students 
are given a score from one to five to deter-
mine whether they are recommended for 
acceptance.

In his presentation, Eggers said that —  in 
the 2009-10 academic year —  74.3 percent of 
students were admitted to UCLA, 23.9 percent 
admitted to UCSD and not UCLA and 1.9 per-
cent admitted to UCLA and not UCSD. 

“When you look at the 1.9 percent of 
applicants who were admitted by UCSD but

Hundreds of students gathered at the A.S. Forum last night to watch the council 
debate a controversial resolu-
tion calling for the University 
of California to stop investing 
in companies providing military 
technology to Israel. The resolu-
tion identified the Palestinian 
territories as being occupied by 
a military force guilty of com-
mitting human rights violations 

against the Palestinian people. 
The council ultimately voted 
13-10-4 to create a committee 
to further discuss the resolution. 

The resolution, which was 
modeled after a 
similar effort at UC 
Berkeley, called for 
the UC Board of 
Regents to divest 

endowment funds from corpo-
rations such as General Electric 
and United Technologies. 
According to the resolution, 
these companies manufacture 
technology used in military 

weapons and vehicles, such as 
helicopters, used in war crimes 
in the Middle East. 

According to Associate 
Vice President of Enterprise 
Operations Rishi Ghosh — who 
helped draft the document — 
the resolution is not the first of 
its kind. However, Ghosh said, if 
it had passed, it would have been 
the first recognition of Israel’s 
war crimes to be approved at 
a public university. Hampshire

SUN GOD ISSUE

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie

Various councilmembers — including 
both Gupta and A.S. President-elect 
Wafa Ben Hassine — allege that, once 
chosen, those who sit on the commit-
tees do little to inform the council prior 
to making policy decisions that affect 
the entire campus.

For example, the Transportation 
Policy Committee will soon be voting 
on a measure that would cut shut-
tle routes in order to compensate for 
Parking and Transportation Services’ 
current budget deficit.

In addition, last month, the 
On-Campus Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality Advisory Committee 
passed an increase in mandatory din-
ing dollars — $98 more for students in 
the residence halls, and $75 more for 
those in apartments.

Though councilmembers are required to serve on at least one campuswide committee, the 
student body does not have a direct say 
in the appointment of representatives 
to most of the committees. Instead, 
students elect the Vice President of 
Student Life — a position currently 
held by Revelle College senior Ricsie 
Hernandez, and soon to be filled by 
Warren College sophomore Kristina 

Pham, as of Week Seven — who is 
then responsible for interviewing and 
appointing representatives. If a com-
mittee position opens that no council-
member wishes to fill, then the position 
is made available to the general under-
graduate population.

Gupta said that, once commit-
tee members are appointed, their job 
descriptions — as well as their rights 
within the committee — are anything 
but clear.

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Chris Westling, who spent the last two 
years sitting on the HDH Committee, 
the Bookstore Advisory Committee, 
the Academic Freedom Committee, 
the University Centers Advisory Board 
and the Light Rail Transit Committee 
— as well as attending Transportation 
Policy Committee meetings, as a part 
of the Student Sustainability Collective 
— said that A.S. councilmembers often 
fail to show up to meetings, or are 
unprepared when they do.

He added that the relative inexperi-
ence of these members — combined 
with a lack of training and institutional 
memory — can sometimes lead to 
uninformed decisions.

“Nothing [about the position] was 
really described to me beforehand,” 
Westling said. “A lot of times, frankly, the 

room is full with a majority of students, 
but the administrator has been there 
for 20 to 30 years, and the students are 
first-years — and, I don’t blame them, 
but they just found out what interest 
rates were yesterday, and then they’re 
voting on increasing student fees.  
I’m not trying to fault these first-years, 
because they’re trying their best, but 
there’s an institutional problem there.”

Warren College junior Priya 
Kanayson, on the other hand, said that 
her experience as the member at large 
on the HDH Committee was a posi-
tive one.

“I think this is one of the few com-
mittees on campus that is basically 
student-driven, because all of the pro-
grams that we’ve run have come from 
the committee and what their constitu-
ents have told them,” Kanayson said. 
“Overall, attendance is really good. I 
think last quarter we had a couple 
members who were sick or whatever, 
and they couldn’t come, but they noti-
fied us and they did a good job of read-
ing the minutes and knowing what was 
going on.”

As a student staff representative — standing for students who work on campus — Kanayson 
does not report back to the A.S. 

Council. Instead, her constituents are 
the residence advisors and on-campus 
undergraduates she works and goes to 
school with every day. According to 
Hernandez, committee members that 
do come from the council are informed 
of their responsibility to communicate 
with their constituents before being 
hired to their new positions.

“I use the charge letter as the basis 
for the committee description and 
commitments,” Hernandez said. “I let 
them know what the committee does, 
their role on the committee, how much 
time they should commit… I also 
let them know that a student voice is 
important on the committee that they 
are serving on.”

Some committees — like the 
Diversity and Equity Committee — are 
completely lacking in student repre-
sentation, based on the fact that no 
members show up.

“The truth is we have only seen our 
student member, like, once a year,” Judy 
Varner, vice chair of the Diversity and 
Equality Committee, said.

In the two years she has served on 
the committee, Varner said she has 
seen an A.S. representative at only two 
of the committee’s quarterly meetings.

NEWS� THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

Massachusetts, has already divested 
entirely from the state of Israel. (The 
resolution considered 
by the council last night 
only advocated a break 
from corporations said 
to profit from Israel’s 
alleged war crimes.)

The bill drew stu-
dents from campus 
groups such as Tritons 
for Israel and Students 
for Justice in Palestine, 
who spoke during the 
public input period at 
the beginning of the 
meeting. 

Campuswide Senator-
elect Elizabeth Elman said 
the resolution encouraged 
the university to adopt a 
neutral stance in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
by divesting from companies that sup-
port Israel’s actions in the conflict.  

“I’ve heard that passing this reso-
lution will divide our UCSD commu-

nity on an issue that is far removed 
from this campus,” she said. “I would 
argue that we are already divided. 

I believe that discuss-
ing this resolution is the 
first step in reuniting 
our community. This 
resolution divests from 
American companies 
whose business solely 
benefits the war efforts 
of one side in this con-
flict will help restore 
the neutrality that our 
student body so vocally 
desires.”

However, Tritons for 
Israel President Dafna 
Barzilay argued that the 
legislation was biased 
and that passing it 
would alienate the pro-
Israel community on 
campus. She said that 

the pro-Israel committee had been 
unfairly excluded from the drafting 

“We definitely would like student 
input,” Varner said. “The trouble right 
now is that we are trying to deal with all 
of the issues that have arisen out of the 
racially motivated conflicts on campus, 
and it’s a lot of extra work — and cer-
tainly, student-faculty interaction is one 
of the things we’d like to see improved.”

Trevor Buchanan, chair of the 
Library Committee, said this is not a 
new problem: Student attendance at 
meetings has been historically  infre-
quent. However, he added that repre-
sentatives do contribute when present.

“There’s plenty of opportunity for 
students to input things in the com-
mittee if they show up,” Buchanan said. 
“We have had very good representa-
tives before… Part of the problem we 
have with the A.S. representatives is 
that they don’t always show to the 
meetings, and we’re often not assigned 
representatives in a timely fashion.” 

According to the A.S. charter, 
dealing with the failure of committee 
appointees to show up for meetings is 
the responsibility of the VP Student 
Affairs. In response, Hernandez said 
that she feels that, overall, student rep-
resentatives are communicating well 
with the council.

“I believe that there is enough stu-
dent oversight, in that college council 
and A.S. are having representatives and 
they are reporting back to college coun-

cil and A.S.,” Hernandez said. “I have 
never fired someone from a committee. 
If I were to fire someone, it would have 
to be because they are not showing up 
to committee meetings.”

There are 44 committees total, ranging from the Transportation Policy Committee — at the cen-
ter of a contentious debate this year over 
whether students should pay into the 
campus shuttle system — to the some-
what less divisive Tritonlink Advisory 
Committee.

The A.S. website states that com-
mittee representatives must “keep open 
communication and constant updates 
with the A.S. Vice-President of Student 
Life,” as well as report information 
back to the council — something both 
Hernandez and Gupta acknowledged 
current representatives don’t always do.

According to Hernandez, part of 
the difficulty in achieving full commu-
nication with these committees is their 
inconsistent meeting times.

“Certain committees meet once a 
week, [but] other committee represen-
tatives meet once a quarter, so they 
only check in with me once a quar-
ter,” Hernandez said. “I’ve been having 
them e-mail me updates, and I’ve been 
really asking them to do it — but if they 
don’t, I don’t know what to say.”

Ben Hassine said the only way 
to avoid instances like the meal-plan 

increase — which passed in the HDH 
committee before it could be discussed 
by the council — is by making quarter-
ly updates a mandatory part of serving 
as a student committee member.

“We should change the stand-
ing goals to say that representatives 
from different committees have to 
report back to council every week; 
if they don’t meet, then they can say 
‘We didn’t meet,’” Ben Hassine said. 
“Additionally, if any big-ticket changes 
such as increases in rent or increases 
in dining dollars are being considered, 
I think the representatives should be 
required to make some king of formal 
report... not just an oral one during 
council.”

Ben Hassine was serving as an A.S. 
representative on the HDH Committee 
when it passed the meal-plan increase. 

Westling said that appointees 
should not underestimate the effect 
that policies can have on campus life.

“You have UCAB, and HDH and 
the Transportation Policy Committees, 
specifically, and a couple others — they 
have a tremendous amount of power,” 
Westling said. “That’s probably one of 
A.S.’ most powerful avenues to protect 
student rights, is through these com-
mittee memberships.”

not UCLA, you start to see some dis-
turbing trends,” he said. 

According to Eggers, of the 1.9 per-
cent not admitted to UCSD, the average 
UCSD comprehensive score is 300 to 
400 points below the UCLA admissions 
cutoff score, and the average academic 
profile is lower in every category. He 
said that 37.6 percent come from fami-
lies with high parental income, 88.3 
percent were not first -generation col-

lege students and 93.5 percent were not 
from fourth or fifth quintile schools. 

“UCLA didn’t admit them because 
of low parental income,” Eggers said. 
“Most of them weren’t first-generation 
students [and] didn’t come from bad 
schools, so that wasn’t the reason. After 
reflecting on the admissions data, we 
cannot determine why UCLA admitted 
these applicants.” 

He added that UCSD accepted 
similar numbers of underrepresented 

minority students, but had historically 
low yield when compared to UCLA 
and Berkeley. 

“The problem is not admitting peo-
ple to UCSD,” he said. “The problem is 
getting them to come — that’s called 
yield, and that’s what we should be 
working on, not targeting the compre-
hensive review system.”

After six hours of  back-and-forth emotion on a controversial resolution to acknowledge Israeli war 
crimes, the A.S. Council did nothing but waste an opportunity to promote awareness.

Each year, come spring, the novelty of around-the-clock burrito access has worn off, 
and most students don’t know what 
to do with their gobs of excess dining 
dollars.

The Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality department, however, 
thinks it has just the answer. As part 
of a new pilot program beginning 
May 3, students will be able to swap 
their meal points with each other 
through the end of the quarter — the 
idea being that a student who is out 
of points will buy some from a friend 
with a surplus. 

Whoopdie-fucking-doo.
Of course, there’s little harm in 

giving on-campus residents more 
control over the meal plans to which 
they’re already chained. After all, most 
of us don’t have the appetite — nor 
the trust fund — to blow our excess 

dining dollars on a two-speed blender 
from Goody’s Market.  

But HDH’s half-baked attempt 
to improve the system skirts the 
real issue at hand: An overwhelm-
ing majority of students on campus 
have more meal points than they 
know what do with. In fact, a Winter 
Quarter HDH survey found that 74 
percent of students living on campus 
have more meal points left than the 
budget suggests, while only 10 percent 
have less.  

And let’s not forget that budget 
suggests each student’s meal-point 
excess will only worsen come Fall 
Quarter 2010, when students living on 
campus will face mandatory dining-
dollar increases of up to $98. 

The program is merely a test run, 
but in its current form, it’s covered in 
red tape. Not only must students seek 
out someone willing to snatch up their 

meal points, they also must sign off on 
the deal at the HDH office in Revelle 
College — a prospect as tempting as a 
cold slice of pepperoni-and-hair pizza 
from Plaza Cafe for the average over-
scheduled student. 

Although this new program is 
being touted under the guise of stu-
dent empowerment, we recommend 
that HDH — if the department 
is, in fact, interested in address-
ing a problem it obviously 
knows is there — consider 
allowing students to choose 
from a range of dining 
plans at the beginning of 
the year. 

As it stands, 
every student in a 
residence hall is 
required to pay 
into a $2,795 
yearly meal 

plan; on-campus apartments dwellers 
are required to pay $2,145 per year; 
neither has the option to buy a lesser 
amount. Most other major universities 
(including equally cash-strapped ones 
within the UC system) offer students a 
variety of meal plans, so it wouldn’t be 
unheard of for HDH to at least look 
into doing the same. In the mean-

time, we’ll have to make do with 
the department 

gouging us 
— with a 

cherry 
on top.

It is four o’ clock in the morning and the acrid taste of lukewarm coffee sits heavy on my tongue. 
Physically, I am very much awake. My 
right leg shakes uncontrollably and 
I have developed an acute twitch in 
my left temple. Mentally, I have been 
asleep for more than 30 minutes. 

This odd separation of body 
and mind temporarily affords me a 
unique perspective into the absur-
dity of my situation. Tasked with 
completing a six-page essay, I have 
instead plunged headlong into the 
grim depths of academic desperation, 
grasping wildly for answers, swinging 
blindly at questions, falling rapidly 
closer to the infinite vacuum of per-
manent scholarly confusion. My arms 
are sore. My head is blank. My Word 
document is significantly blanker.

But I cannot move forward. Some 
distant part of me is so weighted 
down by the sudden enormity of this 
task, so crushed and cornered and 
revolted by the horrifying prospect 
of forging on, that I retreat, defeated, 
into this strange comatose state of 
waking sleep. I am frozen in place, 
propped upright in my chair like 
some insane mannequin — eyes 
wide, mouth open, hair slick with 
grease. I think, therefore I am awake. 
If only it were that simple.

A break would be good. I should 
take a break.

Outside on my balcony the early 
morning air is cold and wet. There 
are no cars, no people — just the dis-
tant hum of a now muted Interstate 
5 and the always-present glare of 
the palatial Mormon temple that 
looms, guard-like, over my sleeping 
neighborhood. This is the quiet time, 
the changing hour, the moment just 
before one day becomes another — 
before alarms go off and breakfast is 
made and dogs are walked. This is 
the time to think. This is the time to 
realize.

In five hours I will turn in this 
essay. In five hours I will have either 
succeeded or failed. The feeling that 
washes over me now is a familiar one. 
Do or die. It always comes down to 
this; the final stretch, the last push. 
Gather your wits about you. Collect 
your thoughts. Make your fingers 
move across the keyboard. Five 
hours. Five hours.

Nights like this are never easy. 
They are a test. They strip you down 
and beat you to the edge of con-
sciousness. They pull at your weakest 
parts, push you to confront your lim-
its, make you realize your capacity for 
pain, for exhaustion, for frustration. 
Nights like this are primal, raw. Man 
versus task; student versus midterm. 

Back inside I am filled with a 
renewed vigor. Body and mind are 
reunited as one. Keys click as fingers 
fly — the rhythmic dance of ideas 
becoming words, of thoughts becom-
ing permanent. I am the thinker, the 
conductor — a director of movement, 
a maker of things. I will pour myself 
into this task. I will push myself to 
breaking. I will succeed.

It is five o’ clock in the morning 
and the acrid taste of lukewarm cof-
fee sits heavy on my tongue.

As much as we rag on our student leaders for wasting valuable floor time making 
empty statements — aka resolutions, 
or press releases proclaiming the 
student body’s stance on a major 
issue — we do admit there are cer-
tain moments at which they are not 
entirely worthless.

Seeing as the A.S. Council isn’t 
in the position to do anything con-
crete about global problems (besides 
maybe allot $370 to InterVarsity to 
throw a Haiti fundraiser), its greatest 
power in affecting change might be 
turning a few more heads to a cause 
— a cause greater than fighting the 
unjust confinement of the Sun God 
Festival to RIMAC Field.

For example, the A.S. movement 
to divest university money from 
South Africa in 1986 was a clear 
statement the students could make 
to push international injustice into 
public discourse. In the end, the 
university did withdraw $3 billion 
from investments in South Africa — 
partially due to the will of its student 
government.

Just a week ago, though, an 
especially contentious resolution 
hit the A.S. listserv: the Resolution 
in Support of Peace and Neutrality 
Through UC Divestment From 
U.S. Corporations Profiting From 
Occupation. In other words: the 
resolution to withdraw UC funds 
from two large U.S. companies that 
sell military technology to Israel.

Though the document would 
have — like another resolution to 
divest from Sudan in 2005 — taken 
a daring stance against financial sup-
port for oppressive violence, it spe-
cifically targeted (yet simultaneously 
avoided the specific mention of) 
Israel, which was blatantly implied to 
be the occupier in question.

The UC investment in Israel 
is especially roundabout; General 
Electric and United Technology pro-
vide hundreds of other services and 
products within our own country, 
and the university does invest any-
where that could fund Israeli weap-
onry in particular (nor in the form 
of student fees). For that reason, the 
divestment would be very symbolic 

— the symbol being that we con-
demn Israel for its wartime actions, 
and anyone who supports those 
actions. Thing is, many students do 
not see the issue quite so black-and-
white; that’s where the A.S. Council’s 
constituents are divided, and have 
been for years. 

The council tried to pass a clearer 
version of this resolution last year; it 
didn’t pass, because of a similar divide 
on whether wartime crimes are 
indeed being committed (or at least 
whether that fact should be amended 
by Israel’s reasons for violence). But 
if the resolution’s only hope to pass is 
with its clear objective masked in “evil 
corporation” language, it is divisive. If 
it had been voted through council last 
night in its current form, it would not 
have represented the interests of the 
student body. 

When an elected student council 
(mostly made up of students most 
invested in controversial issues like 
these — though their political stanc-
es are rarely clear to voters through-

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
The A.S. divestment resolution 

advances prima facie, a concern for 
human rights. No one disputes the 
need for mechanisms like regional 
institutions to protect international 
human rights. However, the resolu-
tion does not advance those goals 
of human-rights protection, and 
instead unfairly maligns and dishon-
estly targets the state and people of 
Israel.

It is important to know the 
magnitude of the Israeli-Palestinian 
strife, but like all conflicts, the 
causes, actors and institutions 
involved are varied and multifaceted. 
I was in Israel during the Gaza War 
a year and a half ago, and it is clear 
to me that the A.S. resolution fails 
to give sufficient color to the crisis 
facing the Middle East, and instead 
misjudges the current state of affairs.

On a research note, as a graduate 
student, I am deeply disturbed by 
the biased nature of sources and the 
rhetoric adopted by the authors and 
supporters of the resolution. First, 
Israel bears no resemblance to South 
Africa, having unilaterally disengaged 
from the Gaza Strip in 2005. By con-
trast, Hamas and the Al Aksa Martyrs 
Brigade have singly targeted the 
Jewish population, having killed 1,000 
innocent Israelis. 

Secondly, measures from unbi-
ased researchers have reported major 

improvements in terms of Israeli 
compliance of international human 
rights accords in the past decades. 
Israel remains the only state in 
the Middle East that protects and 
advances women’s and LGBT rights. 
Measures of democratic development 
and civil liberties also reflect a high 
degree of free speech, free press and 
an open and vibrant multi-party sys-
tem that includes Arabs and Muslims.

Finally, as an Asian-American 
with parents coming from a country 
that does repress human rights, I 
see active discussions on campus 
concerning human rights in Iran and 
creative student efforts led by Liberty 
in North Korea on very real human-
rights abuses in North Korea. Maybe 
the A.S. Council should look into 
those efforts. But for the time being, 
A.S. resolutions need to be respon-
sible and should contain verifiable 
claims that advance honest inquiry. 
This resolution fails on those counts.

Keep Us Talking — The Conversation’s Just Begun
out the campaign) makes a decision 
still so contended by its constituents, 
it’s a false statement, and devalues the 
resolution as a form of mass speech. 
It is a room of 20-odd students stating 
their opinion like it matters more than 
the rest of ours.

We do not so much mean to say 
that maintaining a pristine campus cli-
mate should be the priority; there are 
always two sides when it comes to war, 
and the tension is justified. Instead, the 
A.S. Council should strive for com-
plete honesty in its resolution language 
and a maximum effort toward educa-
tion. The best thing we can do for 
either Israel or the Palestinian people 
is alert those around us to exactly what 
is going on in that region.

Whether or not it is in self-
defense, the United Nations and 
Amnesty International have both 
recognized that Israel is indeed com-
mitting human-rights violations in the 
occupied Palestinian territories. 

The sentiment that a resolution 
stating as much would make mem-
bers of the pro-Israel community feel 
“unsafe” is overstated. Criticizing a gov-
ernment for committing war crimes 
is a far cry from criticizing a people, 
or even a country. The terrorist acts 
committed by the Palestinian side are 
widely condemned; however, because 
the Jewish homeland has always been a 
fragile topic — and a country we’re tied 
to in more ways than one — the U.S. is 
among the last countries in the world 
to recognize those crimes. 

But there are two sides, and both 
need to be heard. The council should 
have at least sent out the resolution 
over the all-campus listserv before 
considering it in a room with extrem-
ists from both sides. So, in a way, as 
boring and half-assed a decision it 
was to push the resolution back to 
be revisited next week, it’ll make us 
keep considering the facts. Even if 
the resolution must be re-proposed 
each quarter, we hope its language 
can become clear enough to address 
the true wrongdoings in question — 
which belong more to a government 
than a weapons manufacturer — and 
promote teach-ins, Library Walk info 
booths and enough open-air hubbub 
to foster the kind of informed interest 
this topic deserves.

of the resolution and that the pro-
Israel community had only three 
days to formulate a response before 
the vote at last night’s A.S. Council 
meeting.

“My community is feeling threat-
ened, and we’re feeling unsafe,” she 
said. “One thing I would like to urge 
is that this is not a pro-peace resolu-
tion. It is marketed to be one — how-
ever, I would like to maintain that 
peace incorporates talks, negotiations 
and respects from both sides of any 
conflicted forces and this kind of 
movement should not be one that’s 
done overnight.”

According to A.S. Director of 
Policy Initiatives Mac Zilber, the 
money invested into G.E. and United 
Technologies does not come from 
tuitions or student fees — as the reso-
lution states — but instead is derived 
from private donations. In addition, 
he said that the investment money 
supporters the capital unit of G.E., 
which is a commercial leasing unit of 
the company and is not involved in 
providing military technology over-
seas. 

Following public input, council-
members began to discus whether 
the resolution was an appropri-
ate topic to discuss.   A motion by 
Campuswide Senator Katie Hall to 
table the motion indefinitely failed 
13-16-2 with 13 members voting in 
favor of tabling, 16 voting against 
and 3 abstaining.

Vice President of Student Life 
Ricsie Hernandez proposed that the 
original version of the resolution be 
amended and instead be replaced with 
a version created by Campuswide 
Senator Tobias Haglund. Haglund’s 
version removes all mention of Israel 
or Palestine and instead states that 
the council does not condone the 
financial support of companies that 
invest in military occupation in any 
country. 

Ghosh said he would support the 
amended version of the resolution.

“That version was terribly 
watered down and a lot of people in 
our community weren’t happy with 
it, but I would have voted for it,” 
Ghosh said.

The amendment passed, but the 
issue was eventually voted to be dis-
charged into a committee chaired 
with Speaker James Lintern, who 
resigned from the position at the end 
of the meeting. 

“I didn’t volunteer for this posi-
tion and this committee is going to 
fail in a big way,” he said. “I didn’t 
have good experiences with the coun-
cil on this last year, and nothing’s 
going to happen with it.”

Hall, who voted for the issue to 
be discharged, argued that the debate 
should be resolved only once both 
groups have had equal input into the 
resolution. 

“My problem is that there are 
members of Students for Justice in 
Palestine on this council, but there 
are hardly any members of Tritons 
for Israel on this council to have their 
voices be heard on this resolution,” 
Hall said. 

Ghosh said that he was disap-
pointed with the outcome since the 
original resolution had already been 
so radically altered. 

“The last compromise really could 
have been passed, it was very trans-
parent,” he said. “They knew it was 
about to pass so they voted it into 
committee where people can keep 
bringing up new things.”

Ghosh said that he would bring 
up the resolution again at the 2009-
10 council’s final meeting of the year, 
which will be held next week. 

“Next time I won’t bring up the 
compromised document but instead 
the original document,” he said. “I’m 
just going to keep bringing it up again 
and again and it might take 10 years, 
but divestment will pass.”

I love all-nighters.I love that I get so desperate for a distraction that I’ll read every-
thing Pandora.com has to say about 
The Pink Spiders. I love that, the 
night I wrote my capstone paper for 
INTL 190, I reviewed most of the new 
Scorpions album on my Twitter.

But other than all-nighters, I spend 
about 90 percent of my time listening 

to the same stuff. Back in high school, 
I scratched the shit out of my sister’s 
copy of Meteora by playing it on infi-
nite repeat. I like to stay in my little 
musical nest, all comfy and familiar.

Of course, as associate editor of the 
Guardian’s Hiatus section, I’m sup-
posed to be a music expert — little bit 
of a problem there. So, on Saturday, 
I went to a few album emporiums 
armed with $40. The initial idea was to 
experience Record Store Day — which 
celebrates indie music stores with 
cookouts, fat sales and limited-edition 
releases from Jack White — and write 
a column about it. 

Or maybe I’d write about the 
shrinking group of people with a hard-
on for vinyl records. When I arrived at 
my first stop, though, I found a couple 
of folding plastic tables, covered inch-
for-inch in cardboard boxes of $1 CDs. 

So much for that plan.
At 10:45 a.m., I snagged a park-

ing spot just outside of Hillcrest, less 
than a block from M-Theory Music. 
Even that early, the cheapo CDs were 
already being picked over while “Evil 
Woman” played on a portable turn-
table. I took station between a couple 
other magpies, in front of what used to 
be the ‘F’-through-‘I’ section of some-
one’s CD collection.

The first grab was Faster Pussycat’s 
Whipped — for the simple reason 
that I recognized the name — fol-
lowed quickly by Wilco and We Were 
Promised Jetpacks, for the same rea-
son. Camarosmith goes into the buy 
pile for merely sounding ridiculous. 
Final score: six albums for $6.53, and 
the cashier even knocked the pennies 
off the price tag.

So what am I listening to in the 
wake of my victory, after making the 
great leap out of a familiar nest? Oasis’ 
(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, 
from which you may have heard a little 
number called “Wonderwall.”

Yikes. Given I know the story of 
how the Gallaghers chose who would 
sing the title track by heart — and 
occasionally use its title as a pickup 
line — it’s hard to pretend I’m branch-
ing out. I’ve got a Da Bears CD still 
in its cellophane and a hot little LP 
of indie rock that’s never been spun 
before, both waiting patiently for me 
in my the back seat of my Corolla 
— but here I am, listening to the 
Gallagher twins.

My name is Matthew, and I have a 
problem.

So for you brigands ‘n’ bastards 
still reading this (all three of you), I’m 
throwing down the gauntlet. Give me 
shit on my Twitter (@off_the_rails) if 
I’m still jabbering about Oasis, or bet-
ter yet, send me more primo tracks. I 
guarantee I’ll listen to anything sent 
to me.

Just remember, if you’re the asshole 
who sends me anything by Muse: No 
jury will convict me, and no K9 will 
find the pieces.

I n eyeliner, stilettos, panty-hose and a pungent cloud of hairspray, Semi Pre-
cious Weapons frontman 
Justin Tranter is about to turn 
Kuncocshun — Sixth College’s 
annual music fest — into a 
glam-rock apocalypse.

The New York-based rock-
ers are BFFs with Lady Gaga, 
and opened for her last tour 
— so yes, they’re a little insane. 
Who would have thought our 
very own Warren Field might 
one day ring in a charming 
number about getting blue-
balled by the savior? “She only 
wants to fuck Jesus!” Tranter 
will cry in a fabulous rage, no 
doubt making Jesus Guy break 
into a fit of blasphemous sei-
zures back on Library Walk.

At least there’ll be some 
segway band: the much tamer 
Automatic Loveletter — four-
chord rockers with a grrrl on 
the mic, like Paramore gone 
acoustic — and Violet Sun, 
who do zoned-out vocals over 
angst-rock instrumentation.

Once the Weapons takes the 
stage, Tranter will be wailing 
through ’70s-punk nostrils as 
the rest of the band jams heavy 
and fast — a battle in screams 
between frontman and guitar.

Letting Down Their Avant-Guard

C horeographer Trixi Anne Agiao tells it straight: the dance department’s upcoming show will spend a significant 
amount of time lingering in 
the abstract. But who would 
expect anything less from 
a school whose nonscience 
departments compensate by 
living and breathing every-
thing experimental? 

The dances in Spring 
Moves 2010 are based on 
topics like corporations, the natural cycles of life on 
Earth and one of the choreographers’ drawings of a 

little girl — launching the audience through a tum-
bling arrangement of conceptual spaces.

Agiao, a Warren College 
senior, said she is confident that 
all people will find enjoyment 
in the pieces, even if they can’t 
quite figure out what the hell is 
going on.

“I don’t want to say that our 
show is audience-friendly — 
because that implies that other 
shows aren’t — but it’s some-

thing that you’ll really enjoy,” Agiao said. “If you 
like dance, there’s something for you.”

Five undergraduate choreographers — Yvonne 
Ackerman, Michelle Anthony, Morgan McGreevey, 
Arthur Huang and Agiao — are showcasing their 
original work from April 29 to May 1 at the Molli & 
Arthur Wagner Dance Building, Studio III.

Set to a score that morphs from the calming 
clinks of broken piano chords to a lively string 
ensemble, Agiao’s piece depicts a character who 
finds she needs human support to overcome life’s 
obstacles.

“I watch this person grow up and watch them 
go through hard times,” Agiao said. “Somewhere

Throughout much of the world, May Day commemorates the

like the best of the hard-working, red-blooded American people. 
This’ll be a single-elimination bracket for a top prize of $250, but 
even if your team tanks early, it’s a two-for-one happy hour. The 
regulations might be a little different — no bounces — but with 
a rulebook that includes lines like the “Dipshit Not Paying Attention

It seems like every disgruntled-looking man with an acoustic guitar 
is labeled “the next Dylan.” So it’s tough to admit that The Tallest 
Man On on Earth — aka Swedish musician Kristian Matsoon — is 
goddamn Dylan-esque. His latest release, The Wild Hunt, is a 
gripping collection of earnest folk jams that — after a few swigs of 
whiskey — could be this decade’s The Times They Are a-Changin’. 
Check out the European folkster at the Loft next Wednesday, squint 
your eyes and recall your favorite folk legend. (AS)

ALBUMREVIEWS

LCD Soundsystem
This Is Happening
DFA RECORDS

F or most people, turning 40 usually involves an existential 
crisis and a sports car. 
Unfortunately, for James 
Murphy of LCD Sound-
system, it signals the 
end of an era — and, by 
default, the end of LCD 
Soundsystem. His vow to 
discontinue the musical 
venture when he turned 
40 means that — since 
reaching the milestone 
in February — the band’s 
latest album This Is Hap-
pening could very well be 
their last. 

It’s a dishearten-
ing reality, considering 
Soundsystem has been 
responsible for some of 
the most acclaimed musi-
cal innovation of the past 
decade. Since the release 
of ubiquitous first single 
“Losing My Edge,” DFA 
Records founder and 
producer James Murphy 
has crafted sharp elec-
tronica that straddles the 
line between danceability, 
comedy and bittersweet 
reflection. 

Murphy successfully 
carries on this legacy with 
Happening. His combina-
tion of derisive lyrics and 
a constant rhythmic drive 
are stronger than ever — 
most notably on tracks 
like first single “Drunk 
Girls,” which lambasts 

(you guessed it) all those 
drunk bitches we love to 
hate at parties.

Almost in defiance to 
his own mockery, Murphy 
quickly turns to a more 
personal page of his diary. 
“All I Want” — one wist-
ful take on a relationship, 
buried in distorted guitars 
and fuzzy feedback — is 
the album’s first grounda-
tion to seriousness, and 
ends up one of the album’s 
best tracks.

Almost every song on 
Happening is longer than 
five minutes — typically a 
sign of pretentious drivel, 
which isn’t entirely absent 
here. The longest (and 
snobbiest) track is ironi-
cally entitled “You Wanted 
A Hit,” which arrogantly 
concludes: “Maybe we 
don’t do hits.” However, 
Soundsystem makes every 
snub-nosed second worth 
it. 

This Is Happening 
cements Murphy’s ten-
ure as an electro-rock 
god. While the album 
doesn’t stray far from the 
cowbell-heavy, analog-
rich electronica the band 
has honed over their 
eight-year run, the sound 
is perfected so seamlessly 
that it’s impossible to 
complain.

TRACKREVIEW

‘Not Myself Tonight’
Christina Aguilera
RCA RECORDS

M adonna’s legacy has carved a curious motto for every modern pop diva: Consistency is boring; 
reinvention is key. Christina Aguilera 
has followed Madge’s lead with unfail-
ing enthusiasm, transforming from 
Mickey Mouse Club cherub to X-rated 
tranny and retro soul mama — and 
now, it looks like she’ll be a futuristic 
dance-club robot. “Not Myself Tonight” 

is filled with thumping Euro-style 
bleeps and lyrics about taking shots and 
breaking a sweat on the dance floor. 
At first it may sound more like Britney 
— or even a toned-down Gaga — than 
reinvention, but Aguilara’s out-of-this-
world voice doesn’t fail her: Gaga could 
never reach these highs and groans.

L ong Beach natives Avi Buffalo have just barely graduated high school, but that hasn’t stopped them from 
seizing the undying love of Pitchfork’s 
buzz-meter. Signed to Sub Pop — the 
Seattle indie label that made the Shins 
a household name — Buffalo will most 
likely become the Fleet Foxes of 2010. 

After building live hype at vegan 
restaurants and this year’s South By 
Southwest festival, Avi Buffalo have 
finally recorded their self-titled debut. 
And Pitchfork’s right: It’s no letdown.

Seeing as their chins are still cov-
ered in peach fuzz, this foursome’s 
sound is mature beyond their years. 
With soft-spoken, dreamy vocal trails 
and warm psychedelic guitars, they 
channel the best of 1960s folk-rock.

But metaphorical coming-of-age 
desires often devolves into clumsy 
poetry that just doesn’t make sense. 
“Summer Cum” romantically (and 

unsubtly) pleads some unlucky girl 
to “leave all your stains with me.” The 
hidden message is anyone’s guess.

Opener “Truth Sets In” is compa-
rable to the childish musings of Kimya 
Dawson — posterchild of the “Juno” 
soundtrack — with its simplistic acous-
tic strums and cutesy vocals about the 
wonders of growing up.

The album’s core appeal comes in 
the form of abundant harmony. Lead 
singer Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg’s 
boyish chant complements keyboard-
ist Rebecca Coleman’s soulful, jangly 
melodies from fade-in to fade-out.

Buffalo’s optimism makes them an 
exciting act to look out for, but let’s 
just hope they don’t mature too fast — 
Zahner-Isenberg’s high-pitched hums 
aren’t likely to survive the ravages of 
puberty.

HIATUS� THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�9

out so far. It’s pretty exciting.
G: No rest for the wicked.
JT: Yeah, no rest ever; fuck that. 
We don’t want to rest. We want to 
become the most loved and hated 
band in the entire world before 2010 
is over. Can’t really rest to accom-
plish that.
G: At some point, I saw on one of 
the band biographies — did Lady 
Gaga open for you guys at one 
point?
JT: Yes. …We met her through a 
friend of a friend, [heard] that she 
was a big fan of ours and we went 
and checked her out on good old 
MySpace in 2006. She was fucking 
amazing, and obviously we’re a rock 
band with our shows — really fun 
and really over the top — and hav-
ing boring hipster bands that stare 
at their feet open for us didn’t really 
work out too well. So having this 
crazy girl singing pop songs, light-
ing shit on fire [and] holding a disco 
ball was definitely a much better 
option. And it was amazing … Here 
we are in 2010 playing arenas, so 
can’t complain.
G: I believe I saw that all of you 
went to music school together — or 
almost all of you?
JT: Yes, that’s our dirty little secret: 
that we’re actually all classically 
trained and educated musicians. So 
we met in school at Boston; we all 
went to Berklee College of Music 
in Boston. We met the first week, 
but we didn’t really start the band 
until we were done with college. We 
all studied every kind of music you 
can. Our drummer has a degree in 
classical composition, and I have 
a degree in songwriting — what-
ever the fuck that means. Once we 
finished school and had studied all 
this intense intellectual music, we 
decided that we wanted to get back 
to the music that inspired us as 
teenagers, which was filthy rock ‘n’ 

roll. So here we are.
G: When you guys went back to 
filthy glamour rock ‘n’ roll, were 
you already on the way to being the 
stage personalities that you are, that 
the whole band is right now — or 
did that come right after music 
school?
JT: My stage personality is my 
real-life personality; it’s just who I 
am. It’s been on and off since I was 
15. I’ve been drinking ridiculous 

and looking 
ridiculous 
and all those 
good things, 
but when we 
all moved to 
New York, we 
were all really 
shocked by how 
boring New 
York was. We 
thought it was 
going to be like 
all of the War-
hol documen-
taries … that I 
would watch as 
a teenager. Then 
I got there, and 
there’s a bunch 
of girls more 
concerned with 
drinking Cos-

mos than listening to rock ‘n’ roll. 
The boredom of New York inspired 
us to be even more ridiculous … 
kind of piss everyone off in a good 
way.
G: Have you guys played universi-
ties before, or is this the first one?
JT: This is the first one. We played 
at Purdue [University] with Gaga, 
but it was an open-to-the-public 
show. So this is the first time we’re 
doing an official college show — 
which we’re actually really, really 
excited about, because the Purdue 
shows that we did with Gaga were 
the most insane shows of the entire 

American tour. So I can’t wait; 
those kids were just fucking nuts. 
We actually went back there and 
played there twice, which was really 
fucking fun. And then [for] our 
show at Chicago on Friday, actually 
a lot of kids from Purdue drove six 
hours to come see us in Chicago. I 
think music and rock ‘n’ roll is such 
an important thing for people from 
the ages of 15 to 25 that to get the 
chance to play at a college is pretty 
awesome.
G: I did see something about a guy 
on your Twitter feed taking the 
Greyhound like eight hours and 
then being homeless for three days?
JT: Yes! I did see that too. It’s pretty 
fucking amazing. He’s a good, awe-
some fan of ours that has brought a 
lot of people to our music.
G: I’m actually really interested 
to see how the crowd goes for the 
performance on Friday.
JT: I can’t wait. All good things 
should be loved or hated. I think 
people are really surprised; our 
fanbase is a really mixed crowd. 
People come to the show and don’t 
really know who we are. People who 
don’t think they’re going to like us 
will really, really love us. A lot of 
dudes, — if you will, “bros” — end 
up loving our show after a couple 
songs because the guitar solos are so 
great, and girls take off their clothes 
and show me their tits. There’s fun 
there for everybody.
G: [Is there] anything else that 
you’ve got to say that you want the 
students of UCSD to hear?
JT: Well, one: We’ve actually had a 
great time in San Diego many times, 
so we’re really, really excited to be 
back. And two: I think everyone’s 
gonna love the show. I’ll pour 
champagne in your mouth, there are 
guitar solos, there are six-inch heels 
and our goal at every show we do is 
to get everyone in the room laid by 
the time they leave.

along the way, they have to face 
themselves, get over it and snap 
themselves back into life. The main 
character ignores the other dancers 
on stage, gets caught up in emotion 
and eventually decides that ‘I can’t do 
this anymore, I need to come back to 
these people around me.’”

The number is filled with images 
of nature — both still and moving — 
including the metamorphosis of a cat-
erpillar into a butterfly. Agiao said she 
draws parallels between the character 
she created and herself. 

“As dancers, the way we work 
through things is by dancing,” she 
said. “In my life, there are three 
things: friends, family and dance.”

Her handpicked cast of 16 helps 
carry out the journey, which Agiao 
said she has been planning since 
the end of the 2008-09 academic 

year. Watching her brainchild come 
together has been a rewarding experi-
ence for the senior, who previously 
only choreographed for one other 
major production.

“It’s always fun and exciting when 
things get finished,” Agiao said. “The 
dancers are excited, too.”

Although she said the show is best 
described as a contemporary dance 
performance, Agiao said it often tran-
scends the tranquility of the genre.

“I have dancers in my piece that 
can fly off the floor,” she said.

Of the five pieces, only Anthony’s 
and Ackerman’s will feature profes-
sional solos — the other three use 
solely undergraduate dance students. 

“Expect a show that is short and 
sweet,” Agiao said. “It will feel like no 
time has gone by. Expect to see a lot of 
amazing dances and amazing images. 
There’s such a range of everything.”

SPORTS� THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

said. “But we played with our hearts 
and left it on the field”.

On Sunday, the Tritons knew they 
needed to take Game Three of the 
series to keep any hopes for the play-
offs alive. Lesovsky took the lead, 
hitting a home run in the first inning. 
Although San Bernardino evened the 
score by the end of the first inning, 
the Tritons continued to tack on runs 
— one in the third inning, two in the 
sixth and one in the seventh — and 
held on for a 5-2 win.

Gaito was again a force on the 
mound, restricting the Coyotes to 
only two runs in seven innings for her 
second complete game performance 
in as many days. She improved her 
personal season record to 18-10 — the 
No. 4 best single-season tally in school 
history — and finished the regular 
season having pitched 21 complete 
games in 28 starts. 

UCSD fell in the back end of the 
doubleheader for the second straight 
day, sealing a series loss.

In the top of the second inning, De 
Fazio drove the ball over left field for 
her first career home run. Lesovsky 
then followed with one of her own 
in the third inning — giving her one 
home run in each of the series’ games. 
Ousley also produced another solo 

homer — her second of the season — 
to put a third Triton run on the board.

However, the Coyotes matched the 
Triton’s scoring quickly, surging ahead 
with a three-run fifth inning to take 
a 6-3 advantage that they refused to 
relinquish. The series split against San 
Bernardino caused the Tritons to slip 
down to sixth place in the CCAA; 
they are now eliminated from confer-
ence playoff contention.

“We don’t like the feeling of los-
ing,” Lesovsky said. “We’ll remember 
that for next year so that it won’t 
happen again, in order to make it all 
the way.”

Despite missing out on a top-
three conference finish, the season 
was still a historic one for the team. 
The Tritons’ regular-season winning 
percentage of .600 — thanks to their 
30-20 finish — is the highest the 
school has seen since 2001.

With the CCAA regular season 
behind them, the Tritons now wait 
for May 9 — the day the NCAA 
Divison-II Championships field will 
be announced — to see if they will get 
a spot in the postseason. To earn one, 
UCSD will need to retain its No. 8 
ranking in the western region.

Kyle Hughes and freshman Austin 
Hallgren. On defense, senior backup 
goalkeeper Phil Behm was standing 
in for first-choice keeper sophomore 
Vishnu Prathap, who had broken his 
hand halfway through the season.

On April 16, the shorthand-
ed Tritons were no match for the 
University of San Diego on its home 
turf. The Toreros grabbed the lead 
early on, and UCSD struggled to catch 
up. By the third quarter — playing with 
few substitutes against a full UCSD 
roster — the Tritons completely lost 
their momentum and suffered a heavy 
15-4 loss. 

Two days later, the team traveled to 
Las Vegas to play against the University 
of Nevada on April 18. Yet again, 
Triton stamina did not last long: The 
Rebels broke away with the lead in the 
first half, forcing UCSD to scramble to 
catch up. 

Unwilling to concede the game 
after only the first half, however, the 
Tritons retaliated with a set of strong 
performances by the team’s leaders. 
Captains Tim Riddle, Patrick Cleary 
and Ari Gordon scored a combined six 
goals for the Tritons during a furious 
offensive breakaway that tied the score 
by the third quarter.

Unfortunately, the burst of energy 
was temporary and wasn’t enough to 
bring the team home with a victory. 
Again, with no subs on the bench, 
UCSD had neither the stamina nor 
the manpower to make it through the 
game against a full Nevada roster. They 
left Las Vegas with a 23-10 loss.

With a week of rest before their sea-
son finale against cross-town rivals San 
Diego State on April 24, the Tritons 
took time to rejuvenate and regroup. 
However, injuries continued to nag 
many key players: Offensive stalwart 
and senior leader Gordon was forced 

to face the Aztecs with an injured 
shoulder, forcing more responsibility 
on Cleary and Riddle in the attack.

UCSD managed to stay neck-and-
neck with the Aztecs during the first 
half, however, in the second half SDSU 
blitzed the Triton defense and sent 
the Tritons home with a 17-5 season-
ending loss.

Riddle, reflecting on the season, 
said the team’s short roster proved to 
be tremendously detrimental to their 
success.

“We reached the decision about 
halfway through the season about the 
negative effects of not having enough 
guys on the team,” Riddle said. “Next 
year, we are going to recruit as heavily 
as possible, and we want to have a full 
team next season so that we can give 
everyone a run for their money.”

The next two games took place  
on Saturday at Toro Field in Carson, 
Calif., in a doubleheader. In the first 
game, UCSD dominated the infield 
and outfield. Junior starter Guido 
Knudson kept the Toro hitters at bay 
by hurling three innings, allowing 
only one run and striking out five. 
The offense provided Knudson with 
ample run support: Senior catcher 
Kellen Lee went three-for-four with 
a pair of doubles, sophomore Danny 
Susdorf drove in four runs and both 
Gregorich and Bauman scored three 
runs apiece. UCSD took the first game 
of the day at a whopping score of 10-1.

Knudson said his success on the 
mound could be attributed to the help 
of his battery partners — catchers Lee 
and junior Michael Benton — his own 
competitive spirit and the work he’s 
done with assistant coach Ryan Leake.

“I am being myself on the mound 
out there and just having fun compet-
ing with each batter,” Knudson said. 
“I can’t say enough about how much 
Kellen [Lee] and Mike [Benton] are 
doing behind the plate in making me 
a better pitcher. I also think Coach 
Leake really taught me to know who 

I am as a pitcher, and it’s made me 
much better on the field.”

In the second game of the double-
header, with the CCAA champion-
ship in their sights, the unrelenting 
Tritons battered the Toros and further 
demonstrated their authority in the 
league. Junior outfielder Kyle Saul, 
junior third baseman Evan Kehoe, 
Gregorich and Albitz combined for 
12 RBIs, 11 hits and nine runs in a 
game where the Triton offense scored 
21 runs on 22 hits. Saul hit his sixth 
home run of the year, while Kehoe hit 
his seventh.

Benefiting from plenty of run sup-
port, senior starting pitcher Kirby St. 
John threw five solid innings, allow-
ing no runs on four hits as the Tritons 
clinched the CCAA title with a lop-
sided 21-3 victory.

With the league title in the bag, 
the series resumed at Triton Ballpark 
on Sunday for Senior Day — the last 
home game for several graduating 
players. Seniors Matt Rossman, Albitz 
and Gregorich all turned in memo-
rable performances.

Rossman, the starting pitcher, 
tossed seven scoreless innings of four-
hit ball, earning the win and improv-

ing his personal record to 8-0. Behind 
him, Gregorich went two-for-three 
with a home run, two RBIs and two 
runs scored. Bauman went three-for-
four with two runs and two RBIs as 
well, while Albitz broke the career hits 
record in the third inning.

The Tritons topped off the four-
game series sweep — their eighth of 
the year — with a 9-1 victory. 

“That was a special Senior Day 
to cap off an outstanding weekend,” 
head coach Dan O’Brien said in an 
interview with the UCSD Athletic 
Department. “We are starting to play 
our best baseball at the right time.”

 The Tritons will travel up north 
this weekend to face San Francisco 
State (22-28, 15-21 CCAA) in their 
final regular-season series of the year. 

Knudson said that while taking the  
league title is satisfying, the Tritons 
still have more to work for.

“First place is nice and is a testa-
ment to our work ethic and drive to 
win,” Knudson said. “But it’s just the 
start of what we are striving for in our 
goals as a team.”

HOTCORNER

Career hits by current UCSD baseball 
shortstop Vance Albitz, who became the 
school’s all-time hits leader on April 25. 
The previous record was 306.

On April 28, the junior outfielder was named to the All-
CCAA First Team for the second year in a row. She led the 
the conference with her .413 batting average, .486 on-base 
percentage, .738 slugging percentage and 118 total bases.

W ith only a slim two-game margin separating the first-place UCSD baseball team from second place Cal State Dominguez Hills in league standings, a four-game series showdown between the two  California 
Collegiate Athletic Association juggernauts — from April 23 
to April 25 — was postured for a tense, closely fought battle for 
the top spot. A series victory for the nationally ranked No. 10 
Toros would see them pull closer in the standings, and under-
mine the No. 2 Tritons’ regular season title push. 

However, any doubts as to the pedigree of UCSD were 
stamped out last weekend, when the Tritons clinched the CCAA 
regular season championship in style, sweeping Dominguez 
Hills by scores of 5-2, 10-1, 21-3 and 9-1. They dominated their 
opponents in every aspect of the game, scoring 45 runs on 71 
hits throughout the four-game streak. In total, UCSD starting 
pitchers allowed just seven runs.

On Friday, the Tritons hosted the Toros at Triton Ballpark. 
Junior starting pitcher Tim Shibuya continued his dominant 
season by hurling his fourth complete game, allowing just eight 
hits and one earned run and improving his personal season 
record to nine wins and two losses. The Toros did put two on the 
board early, but Shibuya shut them down for the final six frames.

At the plate, UCSD senior infielder Brandon Gregorich 
went three-for-four with two doubles and four runs batted 
in. Senior shortstop Vance Albitz finished three-for-five with 
a triple, and junior outfielder Aaron Bauman went three-for-
four with two runs scored. The Tritons took the series opener 
with a score of 5-2.

MEN’S CLUB LACROSSE — Facing 
the last three games of the season 
against the University of San Diego, 
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas 
and San Diego State, the UCSD men’s 
lacrosse club team hoped to reverse 
its prior three-game losing streak. 
However, the squad’s shortage of play-
ers — a problem that has hindered the 
team’s performance all season — pre-
vented any such renaissance, and the 
Tritons finished the year on a sour note 
with a 0-6 overall record.

Heading into the season’s closing 
stages, head coach Will Burson faced 
a player-selection crisis, thanks to an 
already undersized, injury-ridden ros-
ter. The Triton midfield and attack 
were without anchor players senior

SOFTBALL — Since only the top three teams in 
the league advance to the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association playoffs, No. 4 UCSD — tied 
with Humboldt State University in league standings 
— needed a four-game sweep in the regular-season 
series finale against Cal State San Bernardino from 
April 24 to April 25 in order to retain any hopes of 
postseason play.

Unfortunately, a series split against the Coyotes 
cost UCSD a spot in the CCAA playoffs, and jeop-
ardized their chances at qualifying for this year’s 
National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-II 
Championships. However, the Tritons are still in 
contention to play at nationals if they end the season 
ranked in the top eight teams in the Western region 
of Division-II.

In the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader, the 
Tritons intimidated the Coyotes early on by plating 
two runs by the second inning — thanks to freshman 
third baseman Katie Belanger’s base-clearing home 
run to center field. 

The Tritons maintained momentum by tacking 
on three more runs by the sixth inning, one of which 
was junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky’s seventh of the 
season.

With sophomore right-hander Camille Gaito 

at the mound, the Coyotes struggled at the plate. 
Gaito singlehandedly pitched UCSD to a 5-1 victory, 
throwing a complete game and allowing the Coyotes 
only one run in the second inning. 

The second game on Friday brought the Tritons 
back down. Gaito was only able to pitch one inning, 
tired after withstanding seven innings in the game 
prior. As a result, San Bernardino came to life for 
six runs against both Triton relief pitchers — junior 
Brittany Sheats and senior Christine Zankich — who 
allowed three runs each.

UCSD needed a quick rebuttal of runs quickly if 
they were to mount any rally against Coyote pitch-
ing. The team did manage to put a run on the board 
in the top of the fifth inning — courtesy of a well-
struck home run over the left-field fence by junior 
transfer Rhiannon Ousley, her first as a Triton — 
but it was not enough.

“We came out excited,” Ousley said. “I did my 
best to help my team out”. 

Despite recording three runs in the final inning, 
the Triton comeback efforts were in vain, and they 
walked away from the doubleheader with a 7-4 loss.

Junior infielder Jennifer DeFazio said the team’s 
inability to rally in the second game was in no way 
from lack of effort.

“We didn’t get the outcome we wanted,” DeFazio
