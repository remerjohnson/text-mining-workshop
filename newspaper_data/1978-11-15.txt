Revelle Food 
Fight Nets 
Fines for ' Five 

By Sieve Morus 
S&aff Writer 

Revelle Resident Dean Ju-
dith Edwin announced yes-
terday that five students whose 
names were taken during the 
food figbt at Revelle Cafeteria 
last Halloween will each be beld 
responsible for S195.4O to cover 
the entire $9Tl of damage to the 
facility. 

The decision to hold the five 
students responsible for the 
total damages, Edwin said, was 
made last Monday at a meeting 
attended by herself, Revelle 
Dean Ernie Mort, and Head of 
Housing and Food Services 
Larry Barrett. 

Edwin admitted tbat since 
holding five students whose 
names were taken at random 
for the damage done by several 
hundred diners is not com-
pletely fair, the Resident 
Dean's office will help the five 
students colJect as much money 
as possible on a volunteer basis 
from other studentl. 

As an example of her support 
of the fined studentl, Edwin is 
preparing a letter to be dis-
tributed to Revelle residents 
explaining her action and 
appealing for contributions 
from involved but uncaught 
students. "We know that they 
are not totally responsible," 
she said, "and we will help 
them." 

Reaction was mixed among 
the three of the five fined 
students reached for comment, 
Revelle students Carl Stoller 
and Clayton Brenner and 
Warren student Jordan Storm, 
all of whom live on Revelle. 

Of the three, Jordan Storm 
objects most strongly to the 
decision. 

"Morally," he asks, "why the 
hel! should five people even be 
held responsible for that much 
(damage) ," pointing out that 
the " five busted were the five 
closest to the RAs, not neces-
sarily the ones doing the most 
radical stuff." 

Because provision 11 of the 
University's Regulations Con-
cerning Student Conduct states 
that participation in "mass 
disorder, disturbance of the 
peace, or unlawful assembly, 
on a University campus or 
facility . .. may result in a 
reprimand, suspension, or 
expulsion. " 

Storm feels that "if 1 raise 
any shit 1 can be suspended, so I 
will have to kiss-ass and pay." 
Storm feels it is particularly 
unfair in his case because he 
claims that "aU I did was throw 
some carrots. There's no way 
I'm going to pay even $20," he 
stated. 

Clayton Brenner and Carl 
Stoller are more moderate in 
their reactions. "I think from a 
legal standpoint," said Bren-
ner, the fine "was the only 
decision possible," adding that 
he "(feels) confident that we 
can raise the money." Although 
Brenner said that he "didn't 
even know the fight was going 
to take place," he got involved 
anyway. "Animal HOUle was 
definitely an influence," he 
admitted. 

Stoller said his reaction was 
"kind of mixed," emphasizing 
that$195.40 "is a lot of money." 
He does concede, howev~r, that 
"none of the possible decisions 
would have been fair." As for 
now, he said, he expects that he 
will be "going along with the 
fine . "

Suicide Phenomenon 
Publicized Deaths Influence Others 

By Monet Payton 
Widely publicized suic:ides 

are associated with an increase 
in subsequent suicides , car 
accidents, and plane crashes, 
according to David P. Phillips, 
associate professor of Sociolo-
gy at UCSD, who bas been doing 
research on this subject since 
the early seventies. 

Pbillips has had four papers 
published on this subject, the 
first of which concluded there is 
a definite increase in the 
number of suicides immediate-
ly following a "front page" 
suicide; the number increasing 
in relation to the number of 
days the story is run. In 
subsequent papers he con-
cluded the rates of car and and 
plane crashes also increase 

after widely publicized su-
icides. 

The research on car acci-
dents is Phillips ' most ex-
tensive study. In it he notices 
that crashes after a suicide 
story are unusually lethal. For 
example, according to Phillips, 
in California lethal automobile 
accidents the average amount 
of time from the incident to 
death is' four days. However, 
after a publicized suicide, the 
average length of time is 
reduced to one day. 

These were not the only 
conclusions . According to 
Phillips, " In many cases there 
was a similarity between the 
characteristics of the pub-
licized suicide and the charac-
teristics of the people who 

crashed in cars shortly after-
ward . For example , it is 
evident that tbere is a re-
lationship between the age of 
the person whose suicide is 
publicized and the age of 
drivers who crash just after-
ward. 

" In general, a suicide story 
about an old person tends to be 
followed by car crasbes in-
volving old drivers, whereas a 
suicide story describing a 
young person tends to be 
followed by car crashes in-
volving younger drivers." 

And plane crashes? " I'm 
looking at that now but I'm not 
in a position to discuss the 

I fjndings . For each plane crash 
there is a description of the

R velIe Curriculum Too Confining 
Editor: 

Once a,ain, it is time for 
UCSD .tudeDta to plot their 
strateliea lor the next quarter 
tbrouIb clau retiatration. For 
Revelle atudenta, uu. is nor-
mally an euy task, beeauae the 
curriculum lal'lely dictates ou~ 
decl.Ion.. Tbe fre.bmen In 
particular are discovering the 
true nature of the curriculum. 
Not. only are they allowed little 
discretion to cboose classe., 
but many realize that an II-unit 
scbedule is unavoidable (that 
is, if one does not want to 
sacrifice the time and money 
entailed In a 5-year plan 
supposedly not encouraged by 
the structure of the curricu-
lum). 

The fact that many freshmen 
will have to take intensive 
courses concurrently in 
humanities, mathematics , 
natural science, and a foreign 
language during the next few 
quarters seriously concerns 
me. This is an incredibly heavy 
load to place on any student. 
Under this present structure, I 
believe that the Revelle cur-
riculum does not encourage 
what it is intended to encourage 
- the development of a well-
rounded person . This year, 
more than ever, I sense a strong 
dissatisfaction among Revelle 
students over their curriculum. 

In a recent discussion with a 
Revelle administrator, I re-
lated this concern and was 
offered an interesting opinion. 

The administrator said that the 
curriculum, true to its ideo-
logical foundations, does 
demand a great deal. Nor 
should the serious student 
expect anything lell. He also 
admitted sensing a greater 
diuatlsfactlon among the 
studenta. But the administrator 
insisted that the problem lies In 
a more universal dimension 
than Revelle college. American 
students are undergoing a 
transformation in their value 
system, he explained. In other 
words, the grumbling of the 
Revelle student is due, not to 
the curriculum, but to a 
growing disillusionment with 
the traditional work ethic. The 
American student does not 
want to work his taU off, but 
instead live life in the tradition 
of those shitkickers in ., Animal 
House." Drink, pursue sex, 
destroy, and drink some more 
- these are drives to which 
practically all American 
students can relate. 

I agree with the adminis-
trator. Our value system is 
indeed changing. But I do not 
agree that this is the ultimate 
cause behind the general 
dissatisfaction among the 
students . . No, Revelle has a 
particular problem - an 
extremely rigid, unrealis-
tically demanding curriculum. 
First, to thinly distribute the 
energy and time of the student 
can only impair his education. 
Under the 'present structure, 

seldom does the student have 
, the time to apply himself to the 
course material to achieve a 
true understanding. Leaming 
becomes more of a memori-
zation game, confined to the 
narrow end of performin, 
satisfactorily to achieve the 
Good Grade . Second, the 
Revelle curriculum encour-
agea a high level of anxiety in 
the student. He tends to become 
(."ompletely cau,ht up in the 
pressures of his own little 
world, self-centered to tile point 
that sincere communication 
with his fellow student is a far 
too infrequent occurrence. 

Alan Watts, a contemporary 
American philosopher, once 
wrote that the only Interesting 
people are interested people. If 
Revelle does not encoura,e Il 
spirited interchange of ideas 
outside the clallroom as well as 
within, then the students are 
justly dissatisfied with their 
college. 

The problem at Revelle 
college is not its noble philo-
sophy; I, like many students at 
Revelle, share its aspirations, 
and am prepared to work for 
them. The problem is that the 
curriculum does not ade-

quately reflect the philosophy. 
To create such unreasonable ' 
prel8ures, Revelle does not 
encourage a well-adjusted 
person, versed in the letters 
and rich with social experience. 

It is the responsibility to 
ourselves and to those who will 
foUow that demands a serious 
discUllion between students, 
the administration, and the 
faculty concerning the problem 
and its pollible solution. But 
only if you are interested ....

Give 'Third' an Appropriate Name 
Editor: 

There was a revolution going 
on in this country about ten 
years ago. Martin Luther King 
was doing' his best to help fjght 
the hunger and shame that 
plagues his people under racial 
oppression . He taught his 
people how to fight nonviolently 
for their dignity . Another very 
great one, Cesar Chavez, is 
doing the same for his people, 
the Mexican-American farm-
workers . (Or should I say 
residents of Azallan, for this 
part of the country rightfully 
belongs to the Mexican people. 
Therefore, if anyone deserves 

' r 

to be called an "illegal alien", it 
is they who are not of Mexican 
descent.) 

What does that have to do 
with UCSD's Third College? 
There was a revolution here on 
this campus also about ten 
years ago. The Chicano and 
Black students got together and 
were successful in getting the 
U. of C. Regents to make one of 
their planned San Diego col-
leges oriented towards minori-
ty education and Third World 
studies . And naturally the 
population of Third would be 
mostly Black , Chicano and 
Asian because it would insure

Ten years ago the University

Amln Withdraws 
Invading Armies 

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -
Ugandan President Idi Amin 
announced yesterday he has 
ordered the withdrawal of his 
troops from their two-week-old 
" hot pursuit" invasion of 
Tanzania. But Tanzania de-
nounced the statement as a 
"complete lie" and cam-
oufla,e" and vowed to keep 
fighting. 

"The struule continues," 
said a Tanzanian ,overnment 
statement Issued in reply to 
Amin's announcement. 

The withdrawal order was 
announced in a telegram to the 
Organization of African Unity, 
the United Nations and the 
Arab League, Radio Uganda 
said. 

"I have decided to withdraw 
my armed forces to the recog-
nized order of Uganda and 
Tanzania In spite of the provo-
cations which earUer led them 
to Tanzanian territory In an 

exercise of their right of hot 
pursuit," Amin was quoted as 
saying. 

Tanzania replied, " The 
aggrellion constituted a dec-
laration of war against Tan-
zania. Tanzania reiterates its 
duty to its people and the 
Organization of African Unity, 
namely to oppose the acqui-
sition of territory by force ." 

Amin warned that any Tan-
zanian attempt to enter Uganda 
in pursuit of his army would be 
"dealt with decisively" and 
bring renewed bloodshed. 

Amin also asked Tanzanian 
President Julius Nyerere to 
curb political activity of exiled 
former Ugandan President 
Milton Obote, who lives in Dar 
Es Salaam, Tanzania , and 
Ugandan exile groups based in 
Tanzania, Radio Uganda said. 
Amin toppled Obote in a 1971 
coup.

Food Prices to Rise 
7.5% for Next Year 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Gro-
cery store prices will increase 
about 7.5 percent next year, 
with the bulk of the higher cost 
being paid to the middlemen of 
the food industry, the Agri-
culture Department predicted 
yesterday. 

Department experts said the 
increase should be less than 
this year's 10 percent hike -
the sharpest rise in four years 
- but they didn't guarantee it. 

They said the increase could 

be as little as 6 percent or as 
much as 10 percent next year, 
depending on such factors as 
inflation and weather. 

Since retail beef and veal 
prices may average about 11 
percent higher than this year, 
the experts said, overall food 
prices also will depend on the 
supply of poultry and pork as 
alternative food sources. 

I-----:--Callfornia's Future----1 
Poultry output jumped this 

year, but farmers have not 
stepped up nog production 
nearly as much as department 
experts counted on a year ago. 

At a similar conference a 
year ago , the department 
forecast that 1978 food prices 
would go up an average of 4 
percent to 6 percent, about half 
the actual rise.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -
A ttempts to expand Los

to include youngsters from 
school districts in five counties 
would result in a long, heated

The so-called "metropolitan

The experts told Egly that 
"lasting, substantial desegre-

not be possible without a

a "reasonable and feasible" 
plan would include the eight

Urey Gets China Mefeorite in Mail 
By Dou, CamploD 

Sc:1eKe Edttor 
Harold Urey, Nobel laure-

ate and Professor Emeritus' 01 
the Department of Chemistry, 
unexpectedly received Friday 
a 5O-eram chunk of the Kirin 
meteorite from the Kweiyang 
Institute of Geochemistry of the 
People's Republic of China. "It 
came in the mail," said Urey, 
"just the ordinary mail. " 

The .Ietter which accom-
panied the sample described 
the delivery as being' "In order 
to promote the friendship 
between Chinese and American 
scientists .... " Ouyang Ziyuan 
and Wang Daode , the two 
researchers who signed the 
letter, also encouraged an 
exchan,e of "meteorite sam-
ples, scientific results , and 
academic ideas" between the 
United States and China. 

The Kirin meteorite, which 
has a totbl weight of approxi-
mately two tons, struck the 
earth in 1976 in a remote portion 
of mainland China. The Chinese 
have since conducted several 
tests on the rock. 

When he saw what was 
contained in the small wooden 
box he had received, Urey said 
he was "immensely pleased, 
quite excited." He explained, ~ 
"This little object is a piece of a 
rock that traveled for perhaps 
four and a half .billion years 
around the sun and finally 
landed in China. It's a very 
interesting object." 

From the relatively small, 
grey piece of space debris, 
Urey expects to determine the 
composition, age, and radio-
active contentofthe large mass 
that fell from the sky two years 
ago. "(t's likely to have been 
produced during the formation 
of the solar system," he said. 

Urey explained that he tries 
not to anticipate learning 
anything in particular from the 
study of an object. In fact, he 
said, "We suspect that we will 
learn very little, but we never 
know." He added, " This object 
may show up some peculiar 
characteristic of meteorites 
that we don't expect, and so we 
are anxious to investigate it and 
see what we learn from it. " 

Sierra Leone 
to be Researched 

By Alilion Hall 
A chance to participate in an 

intensive cross-cultural study 
in Africa is bein, offered to 
seniors and graduate students 
interested in health care and 
developing countries. _ 

Limited to twelve students, 
the study will go to the Com-
parative Health Systems and 
Practices Project in Sierra 
Leone, West Africa with UCSD 
Sociolo,y professor Ruben 
Rumbaut. Students "cannot 
understand health problems 
unless the problems are located 
in the larger political and 
economic issues, .. Rumbaut 
said. 

Rumbaut organized the 
project with a friend, Dr. Mark 
Magenheim, the director of 
Community .Healtb in Sierra 
Leone. Students will be study-
ing in Sierra Leone and de-
velopi ng research papers 
concerned with needs of the 
area . The studies in Sierra 
Leone will include medical 
anthropology and socioiolY, as 
well as history to help students 
understand "how to manage 
the ripple effects" that are 
created by eliminating a 
specific problem, says Rum-
baut. For example, the effects 
of limitinl Infant mortality 
would create the ripple effects 
of havin, to educate greater 

numbers of students, place 
them in jobs and establish new 
communities. 

The project will involve a 
preparatory research seminar 
during winter quarter, and a 
six-week overseas research 
trip during spring quarter. The 
preliminary course in winter is 
to provide a firm academic and 
theoretical grounding for the 
project. The seminar would 
also encompass such practi-
calities as visas , passports, 
living arrangements and ma-
laria pills. 

From bis conversations with 
students, Rumbaut finds that 
the most prohibitive factor is 
the cost involved in the project. 
He says a minimum budget 
would include $1100 for air fare, 
$600 for room, board and 
transportation in London and 
Sierra Leone, and perbaps $200 
more for miscellaneous ex-
penses. At present, the only 
grant Rimbaut knows of to help 
students defray the cost is from 
the Student Center for Under-
graduate Research and Inno-
vation, which can total $300. 

A total of sixteen upper-
division or ,raduate units in 
Sociology will be liven for the 
study. Applications can be 
obtained in the Sociology Dept. 
and the deadline for submitting 
them is Friday.

The Nobel laureate will work 
with Professor James Arnold 
and Professor Kurt Marti, 
along with about a dozen other 
graduate students and profes-
sors, in analyzing the mete-
orite .. He expects the research 
to go on for several years . Urey 
said that, during the course of 
the study, he wi II keep in 
contact with the Chinese 
scientists who sent the sample, 
in an effort to inform them of 
his progress. 

He said, "We're writing a 
letter suggesting that we will 
send them some pieces of 
meteorite if they wish, and 
(asking) which ones they would 
like." Once a response to this 
letter has been received, Urey 
will begin working on obtaining 
the specific samples requested. 

Asked why he believes the 
Chinese chose to send the 
meteorite to him, in particular, 
Urey explained, "Scientists 
know me the world over from

Harrison and other superin-

that a metropolitan plan would 
strip school districts of all local 
control and also would negate 
whatever achievements had 
been accomplished locally to 
integrate the schools.

consider this event to be the 
cultural equivalent of the

around the Arena Intersection 
to be ripped asunder with 
gratuitous special effects lifted 
out of C.B. DeMille, with a

career in the last ten years has 
been uneven, a series of false 
starts and shifts in direction. 
Only John Wesley Harding 
(1968) and Blood On The Tracks 
(1974) from this period are 
outstanding t!fforts. The first is 
a collection of epigrammatic 
religion-tinged songs, including 
one of Dylan's finest composi-
tions to date, "All Along The 
Watchtower;" the second, a 
return to complex themes and 
powerful imagery after a series 
of halfhearted albums, con-
tains such first-rate works as 
"Shelter From The Slorm" and 
"Simple Twist of Fate." Dylan 
in the '70s has proven himself 
capable of writing excellent 
material and giving strong 
performances - when he feels 
like it. On 1976's Desire Ip, for 
example, there are both good 
songs like "Black Diamond 
Bay" and embarrassments like 
.. Joey , " an ill-conceived 
tribute to a gangland thug. 

joking and half 
serious. Remember" Memphis 
Blues Again" or "Just Like 
Tom Thumb's Blues?" Those 
songs are filled with both 
hilarious and horrifying im-
agery, weirdly funny pictures 
of grandfathers shooting bon-
fires full of holes and teen 
preachers with headlines 
stapled to their chests. The 
twangy blues-rock accom-
paniment on those numbers 
added to their sarcastic bite. 
Back then, Dylan's singing was 
often comic in delivery, yet had 
an angry, sneering edge that 
kept his songs from seeming 
completely absurd. This am-
biguity is largely missing from 
Street-Legal. Without the 
safety valve of humor, po-
tentially effective lyrics about 
love and mysticism strike the 
listener as pretentious. Dylan 
the singer is the weakest 
element in Street-Legal; he 
adds nothing to the lyrics with 
his vocalizing.

That is a less abstract way of 
saying what I, pedant that I am, 
would put as thus: The former 
philosopher king of the counter-
culture is now one of Eliot's 
"hollow men," his head stuffed 
with the gunk of outmoded and 
overworked hip poetics. The 
"poet of the juke box" (as rock 
proselytizer Ralph Gleason 
called him) keeps on singing, 
however, just as long as some 
poor, deluded throwback is left 
to roll him one more coin. 
Unlike his fellow mid-sixties 
whiner Sonny Bono, Dylan 
refuses to hole up in his stylish 
mansion and reflect on his 
meteoric rise to the star-
studded celebrity pile. Rather, 
he continues to try his faithful 
fans ' patience with excursions 
into narcissism, the latest 
being the.. epochally Down's 
syndrommatic Street-Legal. 
Any resemblance between that 
album and the genius that once 
inhabited his brillo-pad head is 
entirely coincidental,' though I 
suspect that Dylan himself 
hopes that most of the hordes 
get fooled by the shell game.

probably because they expect 
so much of him. 

Dylan will be returning to San 
Diego for a Sports Arena 
concert November 17, his first 
local appearance here in well 
over a decade. His devotees 
snapped up pckets as soon as 
they went on sale last month, 
many waiting overnight for the 
chance to participate in a mass 
audience with the living legend 
himself. Being in the same 
building with Bob Dylan is like 
witnessing a presidential 
inauguration - good or bad, it's 
an Event, something historic. 

This sort of hero-worship has 
caused a backlash of anti· 
Dylan sentiment over the 
years , especially recently . 
Rollins Stone, the Village Voice 
and other periodicals featuring 
rock criticism have been 
lambasting Dylan lately as a 
self-indulgent has-been , all 
style and no substance. Street-
Le,al, his latest Ip, has been 
called sloppy and vacuous by 
many critics. 

Some of these charges are 
valid. pylan certainly is in a 
position to release almost 
anything and have it sell a good 
number of records. Exactly 
how interested he is in pleasing 
his public isn't clear - his 
recent cinematic effort, Renal-
do And Clara, little more than 
an enormous home movie of 
Bob and his huddies, obviously 
wasn't calculated for mass 
appeal. Dylan has shown more 
arrogance than good business 
sense in recenlyears; tie's been 
willing to abandon proven 
formulas to risk artistic and 
commercial failure. 

Street· Legal has some 
definite flaws. Musically some 
of the cuts .are stroll! ("The 

That being said, I'm still 
looking forward to future Bob 
Dylan albums. There is always 

"There Is always a chance he'll 
come up with an Impressive song 
or two, maybe an album of them." 
Changing of The Guards" is a 
compelling rhythmic chant, for 
instance) . But the arrange-
ments are mishandled; Dylan 
is trying to creat a gospel/soul 
sound on this album, something 
he's never attempted before. 
He uses a female backup trio on 
every song until the effect 
becomes monotonous. The 
saxophone playing on the 
album (I can't recall Dylan 
ever using sax on a record 
before) likewise seems in-
appropriate at times. The 
overall sound is intriguing but 
often garish and cluttered. 

The melodramatic quality of 
Street-Legal's music leaves 
little room for humor in the 
lyrics or the singing - Dylan 
had better mean every word 
he's saying here or all that 
gospel wailing and those 

. blaring horns are wasted . 
However, some of Dylan's best 
moments in the past have come 

a chance with each release that 
he ' ll come up with an im-
pressive song or two, maybe an 
album of them. Perhaps he 'll 
perform something new at 
Friday ' s concert that will 
electrify everybody. Or maybe 
he ' ll present another " Joey." 
You can't depend on Dylan 
these days - but you can 't 
ignore him either. When the 
mood strikes him , few re -
cording artists are his equal.

manhandled their league, also 
compiling a 5-6 record . High Times 
spoiled Wet Dreams , 34-3 , Hot 
Popcorn mutilated the Mutants, 12-3, 
and Tide Tubes whipped the Water 
Wonders, 28-0. In 7th position, Golden 
Showers, now 4-2, tied the Fallopian 
Tubes and Wet Dreams (3·1) were 
mopped up by High Times, 3-34 . 
Rounding out the bottom slots, Flotilla 
the Hun, ' number 9, has been in 

drydock the past three weeks, and 
Squeaky Rubbers (3-3) dropped a 
thriller to the Tubes, 9-10, to clinch the 
loth spot. 

COED A 
White Punks on Tubes, the number 

one ranked A team, popped the 
Rubbers last week, 19-8. The Team 

wrin~led the Winkle-Dinkies, 4H), 
Water Wizards turned off Shower 
Massage, 25-4, and Dankins in her 
Tube outsmoked Heads for Hemp, ll-
8. In the middle ofthe pack at number 
5, Rubber Duckies (5-0) gave the bottle 
to Innertube Babies, 27-6. Sea Gulls 
and the Tubes, both with identical 3-1 
records, won their games last week. 
The Gulls outlasted Inner Tubes, 1-0, 
and the Tubes outnumbered Nume-
noreans, 9-3. New Animals are still ina 
holding pattern waiting for the perfect 
moment to make their "big splash." 
Heads for Hemp (2-2) coughed in up 
against Dankins , 8-11, and Holy 
Rubbers rounded out the top ten by 
spaCing out Marsolans, U-S . 

Turkey Trot 
The Sixth Annual UCSD Turkey Trot 

will take place this Saturday , 
November 18 at 10 am on the Muir 
Field. Two separate cross-country 
courses are being set up for the event 
that is open to all campus runners and 
joggers. The courses measure 
approximately 2.9 and 4.9 miles in 
length and wind around campus roads, 
paths, and the campus cross country 
courses just north and east of Central 
Library. 

There will be two divisions - an 
OPEN event for those with previous or 
current cross-country experience 
within the past year and the 
REGULAR competition that is open to 
all others. 

Jt~nners are asked to predict their 

times for either one of the courses and 
those finishing closest to their 
predictions are awarded . delicious 
Thanksgiving turkeys. Turkeys will 
also be given to those finishing the 
fastest in a number of different 
categories. i 

Last year's Turkey Trot and Half-
Turkey Trot winners, Gary Nitti and 
Larry Woolf are expected to defend 
their titles. 

Sign-ups for the event will be taken 
through Friday in the Rec Gym office 
where you can also obtain maps of the 
two courses. Last year over 125 
runners participated in the popular 
event and indications are that that 
record total will be surpassed this 
year.

Hafferkamp. Blasts 'Coach Policy 
ByJ .. Geecz 

SeeIar ..... Writer 
Russ Hafferilamp, as a 

National Water Polo Team 
member, knows of the poli-
tics that pervade national and 
international athletics. But the 
aura of politics is not limited to 
"big-time" sports. According 
to the young coach, it can be 
seen at UCSD also. 

"UCSD hires kids fresh out of 
colle,e for their coaching 
positions," said Hafferkamp. 
"It's good for the scbool 
because they're ,ettiq cheap 
labor. It's good for the coaches 
because they use UCSD as a 
steppin, stone to other jobs. 
But the athletes are getting the 
shaft." 

"It's sad to see," be con-
tinues. "I'm going to benefit 
from it, though. Tbe part-time 
coachin, policy produces 
transient coaches. Hell, I've 
been here two years, and that's 
almost teoure for here." 

"Coaches recruit a ,ood 
team - and then they're gone. 
Players often have two or three 
coaches from their freshman to 

-senior year. They eventually 
lose interest and drop out." 

"I am a strong advocate of a 
full-time aquatics position. I 
have talked to Judy (Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet) about it, 
but I've gotten nowhere." 

But the players who stick it 
out as UCSD are much like 

Hafferkamp, who put himself 
through college without the aid 
of scholarships. 

A football and basketball 
player in bigh school, he first 
entered the sport which is now 
his vocation at Santa Barbara 
City College. Applying wbat he 
learned In other sports to his 
water polo game, he improved 
steadily for two years, then 
transferred to San Diego State. 

Playing well there, winning 
some awards and working 
toward a BA in Recreation 
Management, Hafferkamp was 
ready for another year at 
SDSU. But when the coach quit, 
hAras off to UC Santa Barbara. 

Red-shirting his senior year, 
he returned the next season to 
earn first team All-American 
honors, first team All PCAA 
and tearn Most Valuable Play-
er. 

Since then, the 23-year-old 
player/coach bas been a 
member of the US National 
team, and will resume training 
with them after the inter-
collegiate season ends. The 
Southern California players on 
the team practice at Long 
Beach twice weekiy and hold a 
joint workout with the Northern 
California players 00 weekends 
(virtually all team members 
hail from California) . 

"It gets harder and harder 
every year to work out," said 
Hafferkarnp. "I think to my-

R.ss Hafterluunp, Trltoa Waler Polo coaeh ........ s... ..... 

self, 'What the hell am I doing? 
My friends are at home having 
a good time partying, and here I 
am.' tt 

But the ultimate reward 
could be worth the . pain in-
volved in training - a trip to the 
1910 Moscow Olympic Games. 
International competition, as 
Hafferkamp knows from play-
ing overseas, is quite different 
from water polo in the states. 

National team coach Monte 
Nitzkowski commented , 
"Heck, our players are better 
known in Europe than in the 
U.S. In Europe, water polo 
games are big, particularly in 
Hungary, Russia, Italy and 
Yugoslavia. One of the things 
our players have to adapt to is 
playing in front of 1000 people, 
instead of just their parents and 
girlfriends ... 

Hafferkamp's playing ex-
perience on the world level 
provides the Triton team with a 
unique advantage. "Older 
coaches just tell their players 
how to do something. I can get 
in the pool and show thell'l how. 
It gives me more credibility as 
a coach." 

The coach, who will celebrate 
his 24th birthday next month, 
also has the advantage of being 
on the same age level as his 
players. " I know exactly what 
they're going through, so I can 
relate to them. I can com-
municate effectively with 
every member of the team and 
that carries over to the 
games." 

" I don ' t dictate their life-
style,'.' he continues. "I'm in 
charge ot them rrom 3-5 p.m. 

(d~ring the workout) and that's, 
the extent of it. We joke 
together, go to parties together. 
I treat them like adults and 
expect them to act like adults." 
. "We've got a young team and 

we're getting a real name for 
ourselves. UCSD water polo 
will keep on going up and up." 
And if Hafferkamp can afford 
to, he will remain a part of this 
growing team.

Suicide Study 
(Continued from pace I) 
crull publilbed by the federal 
government, and from thole 
descriptions one can get a lot of 
infonnation about each crah, 
but I haven't finisbed that 
investigation. 

The private plane crashes 
that Phillips has looked at were 
taken from sourcessucb as the 
Aireraft Accident Report put 
out by the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board, which i8 a 
list of all plane crashes oc-
curring throughout the coun-
try. 
. The newspapers that pro-

vided the information for the 
first suicide paper are among 
the most widely read in Ameri-
ca and Britain: the New York 
TImes, New York Daily News, 
Cblc8l0 Tribune and LoDdoD 

t. 

Daily Mirror. The aaaumption 
was that whatever suicide was 
covered in these papers would 
be carried in other major 
newspapers. 

According to Phillips, there 
have been very few studies on 
student suicides. Most of the 
studies conducted have come to 
the general conclusion that 
there is a hiJher incidence of 
suicide in high pressure uni-
versities than any other kind of 
school. 

Each summer a course is 
taught on suicide by Phillips. 
The course covers two areas: 
study through biographical 
information and suicide notes, 
and studying suicide statis-
tically. 

Bob Dylan 
(Condnued from page ') 
the Impact Is steadily les-
sening. The songs on S&ree&-
Lelai sure sound important -
lyrics about gods with long 
golden locks and bot juice 
ruDDing down legs (shades of 
Led Zepplin) and ponies named 
Lucifer and fools caught In 
magnetic fields . But despite the 
beroic and ultimately shrill 
ranUn,. of Jan Wenner and the 
ersatz philosophizing of Jon-
athon Cott placing this album 
along with Dylan's best work, 
all the scatter-shot imagery on 
Le.lal misses the target, 
lacking focus, humor, wit or 
any other kind of tangible 
essence tbat miJht have made 
the invitation of "getting into" 
this album more entiCing. The 
arrangements as well are 
incongruous, utilizing volleys 
of squealing saxophones and 
gospel-type vocal backgrounds 
in an attempt to infuse the 

relentlellly dormant songs , 
with some sort of life. 

Dylan i8 going to squeeze the 
last drop of enervated ~ 
plam from his mystical muse, 
but all be can come up with here 
are muddle-headed meander-
ings about tarot carda, evil 
women and other intellectual 
viscera indicative of severe 
mind rot. A tender screed about 
the time he puncbed out his ex-
wife would have at least 
represented a change - it 
could've led to a Dylan/Sid 
Vicious team-up (the new 
Crosby/Nash?) 

In bis song "From A Buick 
Six," Dyian claimed that he 
needed a dump-truck to unload 
his head_ That was In 1966. 
Today he needs a bedpan and a 
roll of toilet paper. He ain't 
going nowhere but down the 
tubes.

Muir Social Climate 
(Con&inued from page 4) 
gesled this report, I'd like to see 
us all get together one evening 
and have the students make 
suggestions as to changes 
they'd like to see, things they'd 
want to see strengthened, and 
to tell us about their aspirations 
and needs. We can't turn the 
clock back and wishful thinking 
isn't going to get us anywhere. 
Let's take a hard look at what 
we are and what we can be and 
make the new kind of college 
that's best for UCSD. 

The following is a summary 
of Stewart's findings: 

1) Neither the faculty nor the 
- students of Muir feel any strong 
ties with the college. 

2) Muir undergraduates 
desire more pre-vocational 
studies, a wider scope than the 
present majors. 

3) The undergraduates 
prefer Muir to other UCSD 
colleges. 

4) Both the faculty and 
students are ge.nerally satisfied 
with the college administrative 
staff. 

S) Students find the Provost's 
and the Dean's office helpful 
and friendly. 

Both offices were rated more 
highly on their cordiality than 
on their helpfulness; with each, 
about one third of the students 
reported themselves as not 
satisfied with the help received. 

6) Affiliation with Muir, 
which was strongly felt in the 
earliest days of the college, now 
means little to a majority of the 
faculty . Very few faculty 
members seem to take any 
interest in the college and most 
are reluctant to become in· 
volved in the housekeeping 
chores of it. 

7) Most faculty members are 
not interested in infonnal or 
random interaction with under-
graduates outside their class-
rooms or office hours. Those 
who have discussed this are 
unanimous in believing that 
there isn 't enough recognition 
and professional reward for 
such expenditure of precious

NEW PHILOSOPHY COURSES -WINTER 
Philosophy 122 - Bio-Medical Ethics 
Instructor: Nancy Davis 
The advance of bio-medical knowledge and the 
development of sophisticated life-prolonging technology 
have far reaching ethical implications. The implications 
are of interest not only to people involved in the specialized 
study of moral philosophy. or to people engaged in bio-
medical research and practice; they concern responsible 
lay persons as well. Whatever the differences among them 
aU ~hree sha!e the s~me dual role; they are consumers of th~ 
frUIts of blO-med~cal and technological growth. and 
members ' of a SOCIety confronted with the necessity of 
making policy decisions on life and death matters : 
euthanaSIa, human experimentation, distribution of scarce 
resources. In this course we will consider these and several 
other related· issues. 

Prerequisite: upper division standing and a course in 
ethics. Upper division students who hq.ve background in 
the biological sciences or health care experience, but who 
have not taken an ethics course must have instructor's 
consent to enroll. 

Philosophy 168 - Philosophy of Psychology: 
Parapsychology 

Instructor: Antony Flew 
This course will in fact deal with the philosophy of 

parapsychology seen a~ a branch, or a potential branch. of 
psychology. As a phIlosophy course it will not be 
concerqad with setUinlt what the facts in this most 

conten~Ious e:rea actually are, but instead with discovering 
what IS lOgIcally presupposed and what is logically 
implied by statements made in attempts to describe and to 
explain those putative facts. Among the issues to be 
examined are: Is telepathy an essentially sbtistical 
concept, or is ESP correctly construed as a varietv of 
perception?; What would be implied by the discovery that 
paranormal precognition really occurs. and is this 
suggestion even coherent?; Would the establishment Ql the 
reality of pSi-phenomena show that the world is after all 
somehow non-physical. even spiritual?; On what 
assumptions about persons is mediumiHtic 'evidence of 
survival' evidence that some or all of us will survive 
death?; and are the reported psi-phenomena evidence of the 
powers of minds rather than of creatures of nesh and b!OOC1',

ted. 
9) Many students indicate 

that they do not have much 
contact with faculty, nor have 
close relationships with other 
students, nor engage in student 
activities or social life 

10) Student comments on 
UCSD and Muir college ranged 
from "cold," "lonely" and 
" Tbere is a great deal of 
alienation and disillusionment 
here" to " I enjoy UCSD very 
much The location is unreal It 
·s far enough from L.A. The 
waves are always good, the 
studying is hard but that's good 
also. 

H) The " drop-outs" and 
" stop-outs" expressed dis-
satisfaction with ., an antiseptic 
atmosphere, highly study-
oriented and competitive 
student body and low school 
spirit. " 

12) Muir students desirt: 
l10re interaction with the 
·aculty. 

13) The.group that appears to 
)e most enthusiastic about 
JCSD. the college system and 
especially Muir is the one with 
the least direct experience of 
them: the parents. 

14) With a retention rate 
(through graduation) of ap-
proximately 35 percent in 1976-
77, Muir is far behind retention 
rates (some as high as 90 
percent) of comparative liberal 
arts colleges. 

Stewart suggests three fac-
tors are responsible for the 
changes in the initial Muir 
philosophy. 

First, there was a change in 
the academic program because 
of unqualified faculty and 
student dissatisfaction with the 
courses. 

Second, a significant number 
of Muir social science faculty 
were detached from the college 
when they joined their col-
leagues at Third College. 

Third, Muir grew too big too 
fast. This is due partly because 
of a cbange in student life-
styles. Many students live off 
campus and commute.
