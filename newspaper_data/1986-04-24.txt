Student credit union 
to offer best deal 
By BRYAN HARRIS 

H IGH INTEREST ON savings, low-ihterest . loans, convenient hours 
and on-campus accessibility are 
only a few of the benefits that 
will be available to UCSD 
students at me Ut Jolla Student 
Credit Union , planned to open 
in fall 1986. 

The credit union is the project 
of several concerned students led 
by Brett Markson, Rob Lewis, 
Doug Hutshing, Chris Moshy 
and Greg McCambridge. It will 
offer many of the same services 
provided by commercial banks, 
plus other student benefits. 
According to Moshy, students 
will profit from the credit union 
in se~ral ways. "The primary 
mOtivation is to educate students 
and aBow them to participate in 
8nandal decision-making." 

Moshy pointed out mat UCSD 
lacks a business department, and 

~rhaps the credit unio~ could 
give the monetary expenence 
students need to become 
finanCially independent, and 
"able to deCipher the Wan Street 
Joumal." 

Student involvement is 
imperative since there will be no 
paid employees. The volunteer 
staff, small on-campus location 
and disinterest in private profit 
all combine to lower the 

oPerating expenses while 
increasing the dividends for the 
students. 

The La Jolla Student Credit 
Union joins fourteen other 
student-run, nationally accredited 
and federally insured institutions 
across America. None have failed 
and several are more successful 
than ':""Is predicted . 

The credit union at the 
University of Massachusetts was 
founded in 1975. Today it 
competes with banks in the 
number of services it offers, 
including its own automatic teller 
machine. 

UCB and UCLA are building 
melr own credit unions as well. 

"There is a lot of know-how 
behind us and a great deal of 
positive support from professors, 
me local community and even 
banks mat want to work wim 
us," Hutshing said . 

Despite encouragement from 
outside panies, the credit union 
is explicitly a student 
otganizarion. The university is 
not liable in any respect, and 
UCSD faculty are nOt offered 
membership. The credit union is 
subject only to me inclination of 
the student body, and has 
adopted a code of ethics which

Politics from more than one point of view 
One of the first things that strikes you about Jesse Jackson is that he isn't a 

very good politician, not in the usual sense anyway. Where most politicians 
hide their feelings, Jackson is openly emotional. Where most politicians stifle 
your interest in issues through their pompous promises of what they can do 
for you, Reverend Jackson has the unique quality of stimulating interest in 
polltics by placing the onus for change on you. "You are the ones," Jackson 
tepeatedly told more than 3,000 listeners in Revelle Plaza last Tuesday, "You 
are the true majority," a majority with the "moral obligation" to bring into 
fruilion the promise of America. 

underslanding. Jackson cares about people. He wants to know why they think 
and behave like they do. He doesn't suffer from the puritanical ethnocentricity 
of. the ruling elite , but rather, is open to all viewpoints. Carrying a different 
ideology does not make one a member of the "evil empire ." ·When Reagan and 
Gorbachev meet ," Jackson told us, ·one gets the feeling the whole world is 
meeting. But it isn't." Three quarters of humanity is absent when you view the 
world through an east-west paradigm, and Jackson is smart enough to know 
that some day, and some day soon, the ' rest of the world is going to have their 
say. "Desperate people do desperate things," Jesse Jackson forewarned. 

Inhe·rent in Jackson's criticisms were his antidotes to our current ills, such as 
"Rainbow, not Rambo," Jackson told us, a slogan encorporating both his the growing disparity between rich and poor in this country, the casting aside 

dreams for the future and his concerns about the present foreign and domestic of thousands of American farmers'and industry workers as though they were 
policies of the Reagan administration . The slogan represents more than just "our enemies," gunboat diplomacy and big-stick terrorism in Libya, South 
words, however. Jackson eloquently voices the concerns and hopes of all Africa, Angola and Central America. Jackson's antidote begins with a 
disenfranchised Americans , and he does it' paSSionately and with meaning. "fundamental restructuring of SOciety." Jackson is asking the ultimate of us as 
Embodying the best of the co-operative , and the best of the coalition, Jackson's citizens. He is asking us to reexamine where we are and where we are going. 
"Rainbow," our Rainbow, seeks to unite all those without a voice in order that . We have the answers, and the Reverend can only suggest what they should be. 
they may speak and be heard . Jackson doesn't appear to be a politician "If we can restructure the billion dollar debts of foreign countries, surely we can 
because he is what a political leader should be; an organizer, a political leader restructure the debt of our family farms ," Jackson told us. "Surely if we can 
whose special interest group just happens to be three-quarters of the spend a trillion dollars on the disaster known as Star Wars, we can put the 
population of the earth. meat packers in Minnesota and oil industry workers in Texas back to work," 

One of the criticisms levelled at Jackson is that he "can criticize without 
offering specific solutions." But where others - like the President - use 
stilted facts and misleading figures and charts and quotes to anesthetize the 
public , Reverend Jackson is a man of action, a man whose record of diplomacy 
in the past two years puts to shame anything our current leaders can offer us 
in the name of "peace ." Some may say that Jackson's foreign policy coups were 
the result of foreign enemies' desires to manipulate his good intentions and 
give the current administration a black eye . Maybe so. But to the 48 Americans 
home from Cuba , and the fighter-pilot home from Syria, Jackson is a man of 
action . To the civilians in Tripoli , so is Reagan. 

he said . Inherent in any Jackson speech is this simple campaign platform; 
spend less money on war, and more on human beings. 

Reverend Jesse Jackson is a moral man. He is not a perfect man. He is a 
man who does not seek power for the sake of power, and, th~refore , he is 
powerful. His words are appealing because we already know the truth of 
what he says. "The worth of a man cannot be judged by the size of the car he 
drives ," Jackson told us, "but by the people he Stops and gives rides to." His 
greatest legacy to us is his constant commitment to involvement "Organize," 
Jesse might tell us , "get involved, vote. Go to the anti-war rallies this week, 
listen to someone else's viewpOint. Strive for the success of peace, not war." 
Jesse Jackson brings into the world picture something that is sorely missed 
these days, something summed up in this eloquent statement of simple, 
individual integrity: "You are sOmebody." 

That Jackson has talked to Nicaragua, Cuba, and even Russian leader 
Gorbachev, says more about the man and his vision than any speech can . It is 
reflective of Jackson's greatest asset, the greatest asset humanity has to offer:

Final freedom 
By PHIL WILLON 

They're easy to pick out in a crowd. Glossy eyed graduating 
seniors walking around the campus, bumping into things. They're 
always five minutes late to class, they drink a lot (but say they don't 
drink enough) and spend their afternoons lying on the hump lost 
in panic-stricken thought. The 'Day' is only seven weekends away. 

The closest thing to graduating is skydiving, you know your 
parachute is supposed to open bUl you don't find out for sure until 
you're Out of the plane . Chancellor Atkinson hands you a diploma 
then gives you a swift kick in the butt and says, "All right, you've had 
your fun , now.!let out there and be a successful and responsible 
person." That's it, life is over. The only milestones left are marriage 
and death . 

"What are you going to do?" That's an awful question cast upon 
seniors by family and friends alike. It's enough to ruin a person's 
whole day. When I unwittingly ask it I immediately apologize in fear 
of it being bounced back to me. I try to convince myself that I'm in 
complete control of my life and can do whatever I choose, but then I 
look at proctologists and realize ther's no way they went through 
college hoping to fulfill a lifelong dream of telling patients to bend 
over and cough . That's what's so eXCiting and terrifying about life, 
you don 't know if you're gomg to end up living on a yacht in the 
Carribean or in a refrigerator box in Seattle.

I have thIS recurring nightmare that after I graduate aliens come 
to my house and stick a green pod next to my bed. When I wake up 
I'm 40 years old with a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a 
stationwagon. That's all some people want. Maybe even I will want 
that in' a few years, but playing the responsible adult would be 
suffocating now. It's nice having the freedom to take chances with 
your life and risk failure without anybody being hurt but yourself. I'd 
rather treat my future as an adventure and pay the COStS and avoid 
the baD and chain. A 9 to 5 Job would give me nothing but money 
and security. 

I'll do anything to escape the life of a San Diego yuppie: the 
BMWs. fern bars and Coronas. It's been done - too often. 

I know the pomp and circumstance that looms ahead of me is 
just anothertrial in my life that will soon be reduced to nothing but a 
memory, but now I'm on the crack between twO stages of my life . It 
would be fun to fall into that crack and look around for a while

pessimiSts , naysayers and nabobs

to point out that in spite of 
overwhelming evidence to the 
contrary, all is not lost! In fact, 
even the inepititude of 
government offers hope for

let me show that even the

First , consider the ghastly 
threat of communism - both 
the creeping and ri ing tide

Gorbachev won't rest until all the 
world's women and wealth and 
power is in the hands of a 
single, lockstepping Soviet state 
- pure communism! Pish tosh, 
editor! Not so! Pure communism 
will be frustrated by the Feckless 
Factor [n Government! 

And secondly. contemplate the 
terrifying spectre of pure 
capitalism - all the women and 
wealth and power in the hands 
of a single private individual -

Editor: . 
[ feel compelled to vent my 

concerns abOut the very negative 
influence a small group of vocal 
closed-minded radicals has on 
many aspects of student affairs. 
This group of far-left-wing 
students continually protests 
against the university and the 
AS. claiming to represent various 
cultural groups and concerns. Yet 
• I will relate later in this letter, 
most are only concerned with 
themselves and their newspaper. 

Most of the radical 
propagandists I am speaking of 
are staff members of the left-Wing

paper has steadily degenerated

Continued from page 4 
. over the course of the year from 
a serious left-wing newspaper to 
a National Enquirer.type gossip 
column about different students 
in the AS .. Staff members of the 

. n.i. justify their exorbitant 
funding requests on me basis 
that their newspaper covers 
serious news events, and in 
order to remain a commentator 
on current events, it must come 
out bi-weekly. This claim is now 
not valid because the n.i. is now 
little more than a satirical, 
sensationalist gossip rag. In fact, 
I get more laughs out of its 
ridiculous propagandizing than I 
get from reading the wit of the 
Koala . 

The biggest concern I have 
with this relatively small but very 
vocal group of radicals is that 
they are profoundly hurting the 
influence of important srudent 
groups like BSU, MEChA etc. on 
the A.S. and students in general. 
You see, these left-wing radicals 
are predominantly middle class 
students who don't realize that 
this is the '80s nO( the '60s. They 
are anti-everything and are 
unwilling to compromise about 
anything. Because these students 
are so vocal and often purpOrt to 
represent all the cultural and 
minority groups on campus, 
many students unfortunately 
lump groups like BSU and 
MECM with the radical left-wing 
n.i. people. This is really tragic 
because orgs like BSU and . 

MEChA serve important. real 
functions on campus and many 
students don't suppOrt groups 
like these because they 
mistakenly associate them with 
the radicals. I now urge all 
students and especially those on 
next year's council to 
dissassociate the propagandizing 
of the radicals from those with 
real, imponant cultural concems. 
More imponandy I plead with 
these cultural groups to 
completely break from these self. 
interested n.i. fanatics and 
instead follow the leadership of 
real doers like Nadir Haaq (SAAC 
and BSU member).

Accuracy in media 

Editor: 
I would like to comment on 

the sourgrape attitudes and 
rather abusive letters you printed 
in your issue concerning the AS 
eJections (4/14). It's about time 
someone voiced his support of 
your handling of the matters 
despite the onslaught of criticism 
you received. 

It is outrageous for anyone to 
expect that his/ her letter must be 
printed, especially if it deals with 
one panicuIar viewpoint. I am 
sure you made every effon to 
select letters that represented a 
wide variety of political views, 

.and that was sufficient. Anyone

you are not a blank bulletin

In addition, Greg Hom's 
suggestion that the Daily Bruin 
begin a San Diego edition is 
preposterous. The Guardian 
consistently attempts to provide 
accurate news, and if Mr. Hom is 
unsatisfied, he should take 
affirmative action rather than 
simply whine. If he wants his 
opinion in every edition, let him 
start his own "alternative media." 

Furthermore, the Guardian 
should not be expected to 
become every candidate's 
campaign manager. Every 
candidate had equal opportunity 
to campaign on campus, and the 
Guardian has the right to endorse 
whomever it chooses. As to 
charges of "slanting the articles

Hom needs only look at the new

Student initiative 

Editor: 
As our university grows, we as 

students must remember to 
watch for opportunities to 
expand our participation in the 
running of this school. 
PartiCipation in univerSity 
decision making breeds 
knowledge. self-confidence and a 
sense of accomplishment. Coops 
have been a key factor in this 
process, for they are the only real 
student-controlled businesses on 
this campus. We all know about 
the coops and many of us use 
them, yet it is easy to forget their 
ideology and statement. Coops 
on this campus stand for student 
control. They also produce lower 
prices, non-mainstream products 
and valuable organizational skills 
in their workers. 

In the forthcoming re-running 
of the A.S. eJections, there will be 
three referendum questions on 
the coops. If you voted , you 
know about these , but in any 
case, I ask you to consider the 
following: The coops have, to a 
large extent, made the student 

center what it is today. In the 
mid 70s, it was a vacuum of 
empty rooms and no activity. 
Now, you can get something to 
ea t, or buy sc hool supplies, etc . 
Remember, the coops were 
student·initiated and have 
not received the administrative 
backing one would assume a 
student service should . 

Now with the advent of the 
UniverSity Center, people in ,the 
coops saw the opportunity to 
make real the dream they always 
thought possible. The referenda 

. caD for turning the Student 
Center into a Student 
Cooperative Center, 
democraticaUy run by the 
or)l.anizations within the center. 
There would be many of the 
organizatiOns in the Student 
Cooperative Center that are there 
now. There would be many new 
ones (for example, a SpOrts 
coop). 

The Student Cooperative 
Center would be a place run for 
and by the students, in contrast 
to our forthcoming University 
Center, which seems to be 
increaSingly controlled by 
UCSD's administrators. We have 
a chance in the upcoming redo 
of the elections to extend 
student participation in the 
running of our school. I urge you 
to take a step in that direction 
and vote for the three coop 
referenda.

Revelle Bargain 
tsOOKS 

Look, I know how it IS. You 
cough up countless bucks on your 
course books, use them for a shon 
ten weeks, and then what do you 
do? I've gOt a suggestion . Bring in 
your old books to the Revelle 
Bargain Bookstore and sell them 
back for up to 75% of what you 
paid fortem . Here'showirworks: 
- The stOre runs on a 
consignment basis. The student 
brings in the books that she or he 
wants to see, and fills out a short 
form that lists title, subject, price, 
e tc. 
- The Reve lle BookstOre 
employees then shelve the books 
and keep track of who sells what. 
- The student then penodically 
checks in to see if their books 
have been sold and if they have 
any money due. 
- And here's the best pan: You 
can sctthe pna that you wish to sell 
your books for. up to 75% of what 
you paid for it! 
- Also , not only is the Revelle 
Bargain Bookstore a good place [0 
sell your books, bur you can also 
find a large selection of current 
ourse books that you will need 

'for }'our new quarter a[ prices 
lower than the main campus 
bookstOre . 
. The Revelle Bargain Bookstore 
is located West of the Revelle

Sixth Annual Revelle Renaissance Faire 
by Barbara W. Steams 

Here ye, Here Ye! By proclamation of Her Majesty the 
Queen, let it be know that Thou art Welcome all ye good 
men and Gentle Women to partake of the FestiVities, the 
Food, and the Fun ,.at the sixth annual Revelle Renaissance 
Faire on Sunday May 4. The festivities, which will begin at 
11 am and end at 4 pm, will take place on the south lawn of 
the Humanities Library, by the Stonehenge. 

The Faire concept was conceived in 1979 as part of 
UCSD's yearly open house program and has grown in size 
and popularity ever since. Playing on the notion of the 
well-rounded Renaissance Man, the Faire has come to 
symbolize Revelle's academic philosphy which stresses a 
finn grounding in both the fine arts and sciences, as well as 
the cultivation of creative expression that contributes to 
the truly educated individual. 

Academics, however, are completely placed aside at the 
Faire, the focus being on exciting entertainment, good 
food , and plenty of fun! Come join Revelle and be 
entertained by wandering minstrels, instrumental 
ensembles, and light-footed dancers; be mesmerized by 
the mysterious powers of magiCians, captivated by Punch 
and Judy puppeny, and awed by the skill and daring of Her 
Majesty's court-appointed jugglers. Furthermore, you can 
try your hand at a bout of "Baffing" or "Drench a 
Wench/ Soak a Bloke," cheer for the competitor of your 
choice as the Society of Creative Anachronism recreates 
the excitement of authentic joustirtg on the Tournament 
Field through the day, and honor the Queen and her court 
as she parades the Faire envirosn, greeting her loyal 
subjects from near and afar. Finally, visit the Faire 
Marketplace, where handmade crafts by local artisans, 
including miniature furniture, bronze woodchimes, 
pottery, clothes, and jewelry will be on display for sale . 
And , if this isn't enough, be sure to take some time between 
all the shows and amusements to sample the hearty, 
delicious food and drink! 

All in all, this year's Renaissance Faire will prove to be 
the best ever! To make this day more fun , come dressed in 
Renaissance attire , and, since it is Parents Weekend , be 
sure to invite your families ! 

Look for fliers, banners, and more publicity during the 
next two weeks, and plan.to be out on the plaza between 12 
and 1 pm on Fri. May 2 (that's ~o days before the Falre) 
for a special Renaissance Faire preview. See you at the 
Faire!!

Overwhelming 
• sensatIons 

If you have ever been to Yosemite, the overwhelming quality that the 
grandiose landscapes provide is a sensation only offered through 
experience. Capturing that essence in photographic form has been the life-
long obsession of Ansel Adams. A conservationist, Adam's love for the 
land spurred years of wandering through the great natural wonders of the 
world. 

The prevalent manipulation of light and shadows became the 
photographer's trademark. His innovative re-creation of depth and 
perspective can be seen in the 88 photos on display (currently running 
through April 27) at the San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park. 

Adam's work seems to be typical of usual postcard fare. but to see the 
prints in their original form reveals the gorgeous detail and clarity of 
nature in its regal excellence. 

Although Adams was a master of the natural wonderland, his portraits 
of people in their environments reflect a solemn yet earnest world. 
"Trailer Camp Children" is a devastating portrait - the ominous 
shadows enclose the children and their pinprick eyes pierce the blackness 
and despair around them. 

Landscapes do not require abstract thought, but the aesthetic order of 
Adams' photography are more than just poetic. He causes you to look at 
nature his way and he captures it like no one else does.

Ringing in the festival 
by sue peters 

The Pacific Ring Festival is 
an Ii , day celebration 
bringing a variety of music, 
dance, film and special events 
from Asian,Pacific culture to 
UCSD. With a view towards 
the 21st century, the festival, 
beginning April 29, will 
present work from artists 
from more than 10 countries 
including japan, China, 
Australia, Guatemala, 
Indonesia, Korea, Singapore, 
the Philippines, Mexico, and 
the United States. 

The festival includes a 
variety of performances: main 
events, graduate student 
concerts, late evening 
concerts, special events, films 
and dialogues at noon. 
Admission is free for all but 
the main events. Tickets are 
availabe at the UC Box Office, 
Ticketrnaster and the door. 

According to Renee Fuller, 
the fiscal personnel assistant 
in the music department, what 
we can expect from the 
festival is "experimental, 
avant~arde music." Then for 
the main events, Toru 
Takemitsu, composer of the 
musical score for the Aim Ran, 
and "the father of avant 
garde ," john Cage, will 
collaborate in the comic 
musical group THE. This is 
expected to be a good 
audience drawcard. "When-
ever john Cage appears on 
campus, people come out of 
the woodwork because people 

Sutuki's "Cl,.temnestTa" 
know him and they know 
what he's done. Senior 
Citizens are also very 
interested," Fuller said . 

"Sonor," says Fuller, "is a 
new music orchestra that 
uses a lot of synthesizers and 
computers - a lot of atonal, 
off,key music - not at all 
lyrical. Very refreshing 
music. "The Suzuki 
Company is an experimental 
drama group." They 
conclude the festival with a 
performance of CI,remneltra. 

This is a brief overview of 
some of the many talented and 
innovative artists who will 
make up Pacific Ring Festival. 
UCSD professor and 
composer Roger Reynolds is 
attributed with having 
conceived of the initial idea; 
yet he is quick to clarify that it 
was a combined effort 
involving people like his wife 
Karen and professor Bonnie 
Harkins in the music 
department, among others. 
Although actual planning 

began last August, Reynolds 
says his interest in Eastern 
culture dates back to when he 
and his wife lived in japan in 
the '60s. There they were 
"captivated by Asia - in 
every way." So, not only is the 
festival in celebration of the 
university's 25th birthday, 
and the development of the 
new Graduate School of 
International Relations, but in 
celebration of Eastern culture, 
which many people foresee as 
the major international focal 
point of the future. 

As to the purpose behind 
the idea, Reynolds remarks, 
"What we want to do with the 
festival is give people a 
collection of literally unique 
events which cover a very 
wide range of subjects and 
individuals." This unique 
quality will be acheived 
through an unprecedented 
combination - or juxtaposi-
tion - of individual aritists 
and ensembles, traditional 
culture and technology. 
"There are people who have 
never been on the same 
program together," Reynolds 
points out. He then mentions 
Sunday's performance as an 
examp~e, which features 
artists from java, Bali, the 
Philippines ana California. 

The festival has been 
divided into four themes: 
collaboration, extension, 
technology and ensemble.

"THE": an ordinary name fur an .. nordina" ,roup. 
what these signify: "Collabor-
ation comes first - if there's 
anything we will all have to do 
in the future, it's collaborate. 
Technology can't fail to be a 
theme of anything comtemp-
orary. Things which have 
been fixed or familiar have 
gotten transformed by our 
extending them." He then 
remarks how working 
together as an ensemble in a 
performance is not a tradition 
which belongs to all cultures 
- traditional music in 
Indonesia, for example, does 
not use a conductor. 

The organization of the 
festival did involve a great deal 
of work. "But," Reynolds 
remarks, "in a sense it's not 
difficult because it appears to 
be the right time to do it. 

Everyone we called was 
willing and able to perform at 
the given dates." 

Reynolds hopes the 
response to the festival will be 
as encouraging as it was in 
February when seven 
musicians from the Peking 
Conservatory, performing for 
the first time outside of their 
native China, attracted 700 
people to the Mandeville 
Auditorium with relatively 
little publicity. This was, in 
fact, the first performance in 
the festival. 

"What 1 hope most," 
concludes Reynolds, "is that 
people don't take the easy way 
and only go to one or two 
things they know they'll like, 
because the point of the 
festival is the diversity."

"We must live together as brothers and sisters, not die apart as fools . " , 
-Reverend Jesse Jackson on Revelle Plaza, Tuesday, April 22. 1986. 

Jackson

to "heed the call of your day" 

much like the Civil Rights 
activists did during the 1960s. 
He pushed for Americans to 
pursue human rights beyond 
their borders si nce "we're just 6% 
of the world's population." 

"We have a challenge to speak 
more than one language." 
Jackson said. ·We must live 
together as brothers and sisters. 
not die apan as fools." 

Jackson also addressed a 

common stereotype about today's 
poor. "Most poor people are not 
on welfare . most poor people an 
not black or brown , and I1lDSt 
poor people work." 

He also spoke OUt against 
President Reagan's domestic and 
foreign poliCies, emphasizing 
that "There are 10 million more 
people in poveny since Reagan 
began." He urged the American 
govemment to "put grain in our 
silos. not missiles. Give peace a 
chance." 

"The ultimate danger of our 
economy is that we will polarize 
the nation into the haves and 
have nots ," he said . 

Jackson urged students to 
..c redefine their values and become 

~ less materialistic. 
£' 
s "Life is not about my car, my f. clothes. my office .... What has 

made America great is not a 
certain kind of car." he said. 

Jackson also warned that 
"Desperate people do desperate 
things," and urged the poor to 
show restraint 

"We must tell the desperate. 
'Do nor choose Rambo, choose 
Rainbow: "Jackson said. ~

will not be invested in stock 
from military contnactors or 
corporations who rely on South 
African labor. 

Success of the credit union is 
expected because of greater 
responsibility students feel to 
their peers. "The major risk is 
that some students will fail to 
repay loans on schedule, but 
nationally, among student credit 
unions there is only one percent 
delinquency on loans," lewis

Given these facts, success 
seems imminent. Two of the

national conventions that proved 
productive and boosted 
enthusiasm. Students. as well,

As I made my .... '3y back to the 
tent , I said hello to the sqUirrel, 
who twitched his nose again 
(that's all squirrels ever do, is 
stare , run and rwitch their noses) 
and then I stopped to watch the 
sun break free into the sky above 
Halfdome. The light danced in 
my eyes, filtered through the 
green forest of trees about mc, 
and the sky through the 
branches was a deep, royal blue. 
I watc hed the sun for a few 
minutes, completely enraptured 
in its 'slow procession through 
the branches and over the rim of 
mighty Halfdome, and thought 
that the sun looked as happy , 
dancing in the sky, as I felt. 

perfect. I could picture her face 
in th e fl ickering light; she had 
looked so good , with her smiling 
face in the warm glow, gemng 
rosier by the minute from the 
warmth of the fire in 
combination with the chill of the 
March night. There had been a 
gleam in her eyes, an eager 
gleam: full of anticipation of the 
coming week, and of pleasure 
from the fire and the soothing 
hot chocolate we had swallowed, 
and eager for many things of 
which I was not the least. What 
a sight she was. I could have 
watched her all night. 

By KEN FURlE, Fearures Editor 
I awoke with my head in a 

puddle . 
Well , not quite a puddle , I 

soon realized , but my pillow was 
soaked because my mouth had 
been open and drainin~ for what 

was probably several I 
looked at her beside me , snug 
and curled in her sleeping bag. 
Her face was so beautifully 
peaceful that I decided not to 
disturb her. 

I carefully unZIpped my own 
bag and stood up. Going to my 
duffie bag, I stooped and chose a 
pair of jeans, which I quiecly put 
on, trying not (0 step on her. I 
went outside. 

Oh , Lord! I breathed to myself. 
What a life! The air felt like 
gulps of cold fresh water as I 
drew it in with relish. There 
were thousands of enormous 

Sequoia trees around the area, 
and my nose picked up their 
spicy odor. Two of them had our 
clothesline roped around, and 
our dish towels hung from it 
hmply. 

I noticed Dave , a new 
aquaintance, who came to 
Yosemi te with his wife in their 
tem trailer and occupied a 
neighboring site . They Iiad been 

at our campfire last night. He 
saw me and waved. I smiled in 
return and made my way to one 
of the community restrooms. 

The ground was a ruSty carpet 
of dead pine needles, with a few 
large pinecones scattered about , 
and was very hard . A big gray 
squirrel whisked by in front of 
me and leaped OntO a tree where 
he hung suspended. Tuming his 
head, he looked at me and 
twitched his nose . 

"Too bad for you she's not 
awake," I said to it aloud. "She'd 
probably feed you."

was cold, but I soused my face 
with it anyway. Sputtering, I 
lathered the soap. Why does this 
feel so good? I <isked myself. The 
water was so cold I would;:'t dare 
to touch it at home, but here? I 
kept doing things without being 
able to help it, as if instinctually, 
and I found myself enjoying it. I 
can't help myself, I smiled. Not 
that I want to anyway. 

The water tasted so fresh and 
delicious and wholesome that I 
drank deeply, eve n though I 
wasn't thirsty. 

Bursti ng out of the restroom, I 
threw my arms wide and took 
several deep, scrumptious drinks 
of air. Lord , I thought. Lord ... 

Carefully , lest the lantern 
undemeath be overturned and 
broken , I removed me tarpaulin 
from the table. I brought out the 
coleman stove, pumped up the 
fuel compressor and lit the 
burners, figuring to make some 
hot chocolate , and then some 
breakfast. 

In the fire pit, all that 
remained of last night's blaze 
was a thin layer of white ash , 
blanketing the ground. My mind 
drifted to the campfire. of last 
night. What a night! It had been 

And I could picture Dave's 
face, jagged and ruddy in the 
firelight , as he sang harmony to 
my melody, smiling with 
pleasure . And his wife , with a 
smooth face and dark, solemn 
eyes, who sat with her hand in 
Dave's lap. They were a nice 
couple , I decided again, and 
made a mental note to invite 
them to our fire again that night. 
I had played my guitar well, but I 
gave the credit to my high spirits 
and the company. And the 
mountain air, and the stars, and 
the song which flowed like the 
wholesome Merced River in my 
veins.

N OW THAT it's mid -April , spring quarter of my freshman year, I've

c:ollege. As each moment passes, 
I regress more and more rapidly 
to an infantile state . Yes, it has 
been a gradual change, but as I 
found myself sucking on paper

year- long dilemma. 

Everything is new and 
wo nderful. The sky is blue, the 
ocean IS immense, the stars are 
gorgeous and life is exciti ng. It 
seems that all my senses are 
reaching for stimuli , beckoning 
for diversion .

have little or no recollection of 
the differe nces between days.

"Hello there ," he said heartily, 
waving his toiletry bag. "Great 
fire last night Thanks a lot" 

"You sing vety well ," I 
answered , toasting his talent with 
a mug of chocolate. "We enjoyed 
your company." 

"What's on your agenda 
today?" he asked , turning about 
and walking away from me

about and walking on his way. 

"Which one?" I called after 
him. 

He stopped and shrugged . 
"Doesn 't matter!" he shouted 
back. 

I took out some bacon and set 
it going in a pan, and broke 
some eggs into a bowl. As I beat 
the eggs, I wondered why I fel t 
so good . I added some milk and 
some pepper. 

I wasn't tired at all, despite the 
hard ground where we had slept. 
My dreams had been fulfilling, 
and tinged with passion. 
Passion, roused from her warm 
body shivering next to mine , and 
her smile, her soft lips, and the 
desire in her eyes, her hair on 
my face and in my ears, on my 
chest and my neck. And the 
strength of her hands as she 
clenched n1ine. I had slept well. 

What was it about this place? 
The night before , I had 

wandered out alone , far from the 
roads and the people and the 
campfires. There was a special 
quality about Yosemite .

a leisurely kind of bustle, as

hanging like a shroud from the

The smell of my own bacon

CSD wins 2 of 4 varsity 
events at City Regatta 

By MATI BRADY 

O SATURDAY morning, most all San Diego oarsmen awoke with 
antici pation of race day. T oday's' 
race would be different than 
most, however. They would be 
com pet ing for the city 
championships in East Mission 
Bay. The crews panicipating 
included: San Diego State , 
University of San Diego, UC San 
Diego, San Diego Police,Mission 
Bay ROwing Association and 
other club tearns. The racing 
staned at an early 6:30 am . Ideal 
racing conditions and wann 
sunny weather continued 
throughout the morning and 
made the race and outdoor 
pancake breakfast especially 
enjoyable. 

The rewards for all those 
many hundreds of hours of 
practice came in the fonn of 
ribbons, trophies, opposing 

team's jerseys - but most of aU-, 
personal satisfaction. USD's 
men's varsity heavyweights, who 
will be traveling to London this 
summer to compete for the 
prestigious Henley cup, led a 
strong race against UCSD to win 
the city championship varsity 
cup. UCSD's men's varSity 
lighrweights had bener luck 
agaisnt a heavier USD junior 
varsity. Taking what coach 
Lawson referred to as a "gamble," 
the UCSD team raced at a high 
rate, leaving USD behind from 
the stan. San Diego State's 
novices pulled a boat-length 
ahead of UCSD to win over the 
one-mile course. Breaking a five-
year winning streak for USD 
freshmen, UCSD's freshmen 
rowed a tight race with State but 
emerged victorious. 

Many of the exciting 
competitions of the day were 
raced by women's crews. The

Triathalon training at 
'''UCSD Masters Program 

By JACKIE ESTEY 

PERHAPS THE first thing one thinks of when they hear the word "triathalon" 
is the notorious Ironman 
competition in Hawaii and its 
demanding race distance of a 
2.4-mile swim, 112 miles of 
cycling and a 26.2-mile run . The 
Iron man is indeed the most 
famous of aU triathlons as it is 
currently one of the most 
challenging and demanding 
athletic events in the world. 
While one cannot help but 
wonder why people voluntarily 
subject themselves to such 
physical stress and pain, there is 
no question that triathlons have 
become increasingly popular 
within the last three to five years. 

Few people realize, however, that 
UC San Diego has played an 
irnponant role in the training of 
some of the best triathletes in 
world . 

Scon Tinley, winner and 
record-breaker of Hawaii's 1985 
Ironman, and recent author of 
the book Winning Trialhlons, is 
among several top triathletes who 
train at the Canyonview pool on 
a daily basis. Through UCSD's 
Masters Swimming Program, 
Tinley swims approximately 15 
miles a week in addition to his 
weekly training schedule of 
roughly 400 miles of cycling and 
70-75 miles of running. Other 
top triathletes with similar 
trainin,g regimens have chosen to

women novices beat ~tate's time 
in the crew classic, but didn't 
qualify for the finals to race State 
head-to-head . The Triton 
women put their frustration into 
the oars, though, and proved 
themselves to the San Diego 
crowd this weekend. When 
asked how they lIet about the 
overall outcome at the regatta, 
both men's head coach John 
I ~wson and women's head 

coach Jack Vellerga felt that 
UCSD had an impressive overall 
performance. Of all the crews 
that competed, UCSD was the 
only school entered in all 10 of 
the collegiate events. 

In the upcoming weekend, 
UCSD will travel to UC Santa 
Barbara to meet stiff competition 
like UC Davis , Loyola 
Marymount and UC Santa 
Barbara. Ii:3 

Tritons wallop Whittier 
and the beatings go on 

T HE "BIG BLUE and gold machine." It may not have the same ring as the "Big 
Red Machine," but at the . 
moment, UCSD's basebal team is 
doing a pretty good impression. 

UtiliZing another complete 
game perfonnance from 
freshman Rick Nowak and five 
RBI's from third baseman Derek 
Alkonis , the Tritons scored their 
eighth consecutive victory this 
past Tuesday in a 9-3 thrashing 
of Div. UI rival Whittier. 

The eight wins in a row 
betters the previous school 
record of six in a row and raised 
the Tritons record to 17-14-i, 
pending the outcome of;'l . 

suspended game against Masters 
College that might make 
Sai:urday's double-header rematch 
at Olsen Field a triple-header. 
The games begin at noon. 

As a team, the Tritons are 
hitting a blistering .317, and 
school records are beginning to 
go down like bowling pins and 
opposing pitchers. Bob Natal is a 
cinch to break the school RBI 
record of 43, and is just three 
shy with four games to go. 
Dan DiMascio may also break 
the record. In last weekend's 
double-header against Masters 
(UCSD won the first game 13-9 
and wound up in a 13-13 tie in

ApproXimately L80 to 200 
swimmers, three full-time 
coaches and four differenr daily 
workouts are the foundation of 
the Masters Swim Program at 
UCSD. 

Outside of the swimming pool. 
the UCSD area in general has 
become the breeding ground for 
both profeSSional and aspiring 
triathletes. San Diego's warm 
climate, sunny weather and 
proximity to the ocean seems to 
be an attractive combination to a 
wide assortmem of athletic 
abilities and inrerests. Perhaps 
that is why one sees so many 
cyclists racing up Torrey Pines 
hill these days, or why the La 
Jolla Cove seems to have become 
an increasngly popular place for 
distance swimmers. Even UCSD 
students and faculty have been 
increasingly involved with 
triathlons as evidenced by their 
perfonnance in Campus 
Recreation's annual FFOG 
Triathlon held last October. Some 
of these studenrs have gone on 
to participate in events such as 
the San Felipe, Mexico Triathlon 
in which a group of students 
calling themselves "Team Majaa," 
placed first and second in' the 
women's team event and fourth 
in the men's team relay. 

Triathlons and the training 
involved continue to inspire 
more and more athletes from 
every age and every abilitY level. 
This weekend, UCSD's Campus 
Recreation will presem a rwo-hour 
seminar on triathlon training with 
'Triathlete of the Year," Scott 
Tinley. Scheduled for April 27 
from 2-4 pm, "Tips from the 
Top" will be an informallecrure 
on the developmem of training 
programs for beginning 
triathletes, which will also focus 
on the enhancement of 
competitive strategies for 
experienced triathletes. Says 
Tinley, "I'd like (Q help people 
avoid a lot of the mistakes that I 
made (as a triathlete) for years, I 
mean , I spent years training by 
trial and error." If you are 
imerested in participating in a 
triathlon, or just want some 
advice on training and 
technique , take a short jog down 
to Campus Recreation (next door 
to the Canyonview pool) and 
sign up for this event. Tickets 
are $4 for srudents and rec. card 
holders. More information can be 

'obtained by calling Campus 
Recreation at extension

th~ second), Glenn Turnipseed 
set a school record by hitting 
three home runs in the two 
games while leading a Triton 
attack that amassed 25 hits on 
the day. Glenn Burke came in to 
pick up his third save of the 
year, also tieing a school record, 
and as a team UCSD has now 
hit 31 homeruns on the year, 
tieing their old record set in '84 
and met again last year. 

The team is peaking at the 
right time. UCSD is rwo games 
up in the loss column against 
teams in the SCIAC, and three 
games up on SCIAC co-leaders 
LaVerne and Claremont against 
all comers in Division Ill. If the 
Tritons can retain their current 
pace, they are a good choice (Q 
represent the region in Division
