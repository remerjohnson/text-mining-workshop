Atkinson On Campus 
To Get Acquainted 
Top of Long List of Meetings Is 
On Administrative Reorganization 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
Newt Editor 

Chancellor-designate Rich-
ard Atkinson spent his fint two 
daYI on campus this weekend 
jogging the grounds, meeting 
with ChanceUor McElroy for 
over two hours yesterday and 
meeting for the first time with a 
new campus committee on 
top-level administrative 
reorganization. 

Atkinson, National Science 
Foundation Director, flew into 
San Diego at 3 pm Saturday 
and plans to remain on 
campus through Wednesday, 
when he will leave for Berkeley 
and ceremonies marking UC's 
113th anniversary. 

His first order of buainess 
was meeting with a committee 
that wiD look at reorganization 
of the responsibilities of the 
upper Ievell of administration, 
mainly the vice chancellors. 

Physics professor Wdliam 
Frazer, chairman of the 
committee, says they received 
no specific char. from 
Atkinson or UC President 
David Saxon, who actually 
appointed the eight.man 
committee, but met with him 
for an hour ·and a half 
Saturday and dilCWlied in 
general terms what the 
cal1'lpUs is like. 

The conflict which led to 
McEJroy's resignation was 
over a reorganization of Vice 
Chancellor of Academic: 
Affairs Paul Saltman'l office. 

"Other campuses have 
different structures, and we're 
going to investigate and advise 
Dr. Atkinson after talking to a 
lot of people. This il not 
involving r,er~a1ibes, just 
structure,' Frazer said 
yesterday. 

"We'l be asking some. 

people to talk to us, and we1l 
be encouraging anyone who 
wanta to come in to offer us 
advice," he added. 

The committee has been 
charged wi~ reporting to 
Atkinson by Jooe 1. 

Frazer believes that there 
wil be no effort to find a Vice 
Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs to replace Paul 
Saltman before then. 

.. A search committee 
probably won't even be put 
together until after our report, " 
Frazer said. 

Prominently mentioned on 
campus as possible SUcx:el1Ol'l 
to Saltman are Third Provost 
.Joseph Watson and Frazer. 

Frazer is former systemwide 
Academic Senate chairman 
and has served on numerous 
campus committees. 

Watson has been Third's 
only permanent Provost. He 
lays he has not been contacted 
and labels reports that he 
might succeed Saltman as

expected to declare today. 
Included on that list are at 

least four candidates for 
president and possibly five or 
six. Lalt year, only three 
candidates ran for president 
and the election had virtually 
no tiRht contests.

Carter Doctrine: 
Born to Lose? 
Just Another Containment Plan 
Presidents like to have 

"Doctrines" named after them 
- the Truman doctrine , 
Eiaenhower Doctrine, Nixon 
Doctrine, now the Carter 
Doctrine. 

Sidne/l Len. i. correspon-
dent for the Pocific News 
Service and author of 
"Unrepentent Radical," to be 
publi.hed next month. 

The word teem. to convey 
finality and a l ure road to 
1UCCt!IS. The Doctrines are 
meant to indicate that aU 

lienee with the Soviet Union t: been exhausted, and that 
finIIIIy the United States is 
adoptina a comprehen.ive 
ltralelY that GoaWl the line at 
• certain point in order to 
contain - and later, roD back 
- Scwiet territorial ambitiona. 

The T rumen Doctrine ~ew 
the line in Greece, where a 
communiIt ..,;n. w. wu 
underw.y in 1947, and 
Turkey; the Ei.enhower 
Doctrine drew the line in the 
Middle E •• t; the Nixon 
DoctriM placed a marker 
around Southeast Alia, which 
would be kept from the 
communiat fold by native 
forc:ea, Irained and supplied by 
the United States: and the new 
C.rter (more properly, 
8rzezinaki) Doctrine pIac:ea a 
bmier .,aiut further Soviet 
penetration into the · Persian 
Gulf area. 

What all the Doctrines have 
had in common is that they 
haven't rolled back the Soviet 
sphere 01 influence one inch -
they have checked it here and 
there, 81 in Greece, but not 
rolled it back. In fact, despite 
the Eisenhower Doctrine, the 
Soviets have developed a firm 
foothold in the Middle East -
in Iraq, Syria, and South 
Yemen; and despite the Nixon 
Doctrine, they have planted 
their power in Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia and ·now Afghani-
stan. 

Will President Carter be 
more successful than his 
predecellors ? The Ca rter 
Doctrine, though presented as 
a response to the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan, in 
fact has been in the gestation 
stage for a year or more as a 
National Security Council 
response to the .. 10.... of 
Angola, Ethiopia, Yemen, 

and Iran . Essentially , it 
contains the same facets as the 
other strategies . The Soviets 
are to be ringed and 
tlveatened by new bases in 
Oman, Somalia, Kenya and 
perhaps Saudi Arabia. The 
CIA will supply - and 
Administration officials admit 
it is supplying - the Afghan 
rebels with small arms. The 
Pentagon will give $400 
malion worth of weapons to 
Pakistan, to be supplemented 
by ·similar donations from 
Saudi Arabia, China and 
Western aUies. 

And the Soviets are 
explicitly warned by NSC 
director Zbigniew Brzezinski 
and Secretary 01 Delense 
Harold Brown that any further 
Soviet forays in the Persian 
Gulf will not only be met by 
direct and presumably 
adequate confrontation there, 
but by a US attack against a 

Soviet ally · elsewhere - say, 
against Cuba. 

To back up the . threat, 
Washington is forming a 
Rapid Deployment force of 
110,000 men to strike 
anywhere on the globe at a few 
days notice. to accomplish this 
feat, it is planning to produce a 
bigger transport plane, the 
CX, and is increasing its 
overall military budget far 
beyond anything dreamed of 
three years ago when Carter 
was elected. 

All of this is awesome, but 
on cold - reflection it hardly 
seems promising. To begin 
with, the Administration is 
admitting backhandedly ~t

position that nudear weapons 
can prevent conventional war, 
Brzezinski is now saying that a 
conventional war capability 
can prevent a . nuclear 
engagement. This is not a 
reaa.uring concept, if only 
because it gives intellectual 
ticense for more Vietnams. 

The Carter Doctrine also 
has military and social 

difficulties. No malter how 
many troops·and ships the US 
places in the Persian Gulf, it 
cannot ~ibly match the 
strength of the Soviet Union, 
which i. located only a few 
hundred miles away and has a 
common border with both Iran 
and Afghanistan. 

Even 8IIUJ1ling the US 
could atalemate the Soviet 
Union in a conventional war in 
that area - a highly optimistic 
aasumpbon - the Soviets 
would corne out the victor, 
since the chaos and 
destruction would probably 

halt.hipRMmtofpebo~ to 
Japan, Germany, and other 
Western States which depend 
on it for more than half their · 
supply. 1ne United Statea 
itself would be. badly hurt. And 
if, as Brzezinski st~te" the 
Pentagon were to retaliate in 
some other part of the world 
(preslPTlably Cuba), the game 
of tit-for-tat could only end 
favorably for the Ruslians; 
they sit on a long border with 
Iran, the biggest prize of all, 
and could easily overrun it in a 
few weeks at most. 

There is another factor to be 
considered - the Carter 
Doctrine, like the Nixon 
Doctrine, depends oll .support 
from tenuous allies . The 
dictatorial regime of General 
Zia ul Haq in Pakistan not 
only has miniscule support

from native Pakistanis, bUt it 
must also contend with 
minority peoples - the 
Baluchi, Pashtulll, and Sindi 
- who constitUte 42 percent 
of the population. The 
sheikdom of Oman has been 
under attack by revolutionary 
guerrillas for years, and the 
regime in Saudi Arabia has 
also shown significant ligna of 
recent instability. These are 
not allies that can be expected . 
to endure. 

Thus the United States 
again is fishing in a social 
quagmire - as in Vietnam -

which have virtually no 
popular support_ 

Stnyped of its shrill rhetoric, 
the Carter Doctrine is still 
another no-win strategy. It is 
"no-win" not because the 
military power as its disposal is 
inadequate, but because 
neither side in the cold war is 
capable of defeating the other 
militarily. Each can win a 
"baltle" here or there: lhe 
Americans can force the 
RUllians to withdraw miuiles 
from Cuba, the Russians can 
help their Vietnarnense allies 
drive the Americans out of 
Southeast Asia.

conflict is the ever-prellent

Student-Run Programming 
Editor: 

I read with interest and 
amusement the editorial in the 
March 18 illUe of the New 
Indicator regarding the 
proposed re-organization 01 
campus-wide student pro-
graming. The proposal is 
attacked for restricting student 
acceas and input to the needs 
of campus programming, 
eliminating large sections of 
current programming, (it is 
unspecified which areas would 
be eliminated) and forming an 
unneeded and counter-
productive bureaucracy. 

As a Resident Advisor at 
Revelle C~lege and a co-chair 
of a student programming 
dub, I would like to answer 
these charges. Fir~t, the 
number of people involved will 
be more than 18 as stated in 
the New Indicator. The work 
load is juattoo great for a three 
person IUb-commiltee to worlc 

on. i::af::h sub-committee will 
have volunteer workers similar 
to the present University 
Events structure. The 
advantage lies in the fact that 
students are involved in policy 
formulation instead of three or 
four University Events 
admini.trator •. 

Second, !hi present system 
of University Events i. run on 
the whim.s of administrative 
personnel. The proposed 
changes include members 
from SAAC, the College 
Councils, Student Center 
Board, ASUCSD and the 
Graduate Student Council. I 
fail to tee how this expansion 
of representa tion can eliminate 
large IeIJfIl8nts of student 
orientated programming. In 
fact it seems that it is more 
representative of student 
interests. 

Third, bureaucracy is a sad 
lact 01 like_ The outside worW 

is run by bureaucracy and it is 
naive to ignore this. 

Finally, and mo.t ironicaDy, 
I ran across a piece of 
campaign tileralure from the 
Cmnmon ~nse ~ate 01 ~ 
1979 ASUCSD elections the 
other day. This ~ate W81 
made up of past and present 
members 01 the New Indicator 
coUective. The stand of the 
slate on campus-wide .tudent 
programming was to, " . . . 
estabtish a board that will 
bring together College 

Pr~gram board s , the 
ASUCSD Programming 
Commi .. ion, student organi-
zations and the University 
Events Office, for the purpose 
of co-ordinating campus 
programming." If the avowed 
goal of the . Iate is to co-
ordinate campus program .

Soviet Gas, Napalm 
Use Told to Rather 

NEW YORK - There i. 
convincing evidence that 
Soviet troop. are u.ing 
paralyzing nerve gas on the 
Afghan population, and have 
slaughtered the male 
population of at least one 
village, according to a report 
on CBS's 60 Minutes 
program. 

The report by correspond-
end Dan Rather was 
broadcast last night . 

The 60 Minutes crew, 
which entered Afghanistan 
through Pakistan, was led to a 
resistance command post in 
the remote region. They later 
accompanied resistance 
fighters on reconnaiasance 
and attack miuions . 
. Rather described the 

combat as "18th-century 
people fighting a 20-century' 
war." He interviewed a man 
identified 81 Yatrsini, who 
leads a small band of rebel •. 

Yassini said he had teen 
Soviet troops use both napalm 
and poisonous g81 to try to 
subdue the Afghani rebellion. 
A doctor who is a member 01 
Yauini's squad said the 
Rllllians dropped a bomb 
which produced a black smoke 
that left the Aghani. 
uncOnsciOUI for about 30 · 
minutes. 

Rather allO visited a refugee 
camp in Pakistan composed 

almost about entirely of 
women and children. 

The men, the survivors said 
through a translator, had been 
shot by the Soviet army for 
refUling to cooperate with 
occupying forces. 

The official Soviet news 
agency Tass attacked the 
broadcast, caI~ng it part of 
\'the provocative campaign 
launched by the Carter 
administration." 

It called the allegations in 
the CBS report " false 
assertions," and said the 
program was a US attempt "to 
use a low-standard show 
staged by the White House for 
a TV newscast." 

Furthermore, Tass said, 
"To .tage such TV 
programs," Rather "did not 
have to go to Afghanistan, 
which he did, according to his 
own story. In 4I1Y case the 
script of the broadcast was 
written long before the voyage 
at no other place but 
Washington." 

The agency claimed the 
program W81 done on the 
orders of Zbipw Brzezinskil 
President Carter's national 
security adviser I because the 
administration s campaign 
against "developments in 
Afghanistan has been steadily 
losing momentum of late._."

Two Lopsided Wins 
Pocketed by Men's 
Tennis TeaDl at HOOle 

BY BARBARA HAAS 
SeN. Staff Writer 

The men', tennis team has picked up 
every match they played since March 
24. raising the season record to an 
optimistic 9·12. They claimed two 
more easy victories ~his weekend, 8.1 
over New Mexico State on Friday and 
a 7·2 triiJrnp over Point Lorna College 
on Saturday. The wins were the (ourth 
and fifth in a row for the Triton •. 

Every match the team won again.t 
Pt. Lorna came in .traight eeta, even 
thouSthe lop three seedi did not play. Ron .. ,who wu on a five match, 
win.tr before droppirlg hit Iut 
three. started the line.up. Phillips lost 
fairly eaaily on Saturday 6-1. 6.3. 
Where PhiDipa hu left off. Phil 
Kaukonen baa taken up the slack. He 
breezed through hi. match with the 
Cru.ader., _ winning 6.2. 6·2 for hi. 
fourth victory of four appearances. 
The re.t of the roater al,o won, 
enabling Bert Royden to pick up hi. 
fifth consecutive win. Royden has been 
playing very well recently. alternating 
the aixth apot on the team with Randy 
Metsch and Peter Wood. 

UCSD .wept all of the doubles 
competition in atraight seta. although 
the first team barely avoided going into 
a third eet. Wood and John Kroll, ' 
IUbltituting for Royden who was still 
buay with singles. scraped by' 7 ·5. 7-6 
fqr the win. 

Coach Tad Yarnaguchi said "Thi. 
one was pretty scary. I though for a 
while that we were going to lose it. 
They Won 5·4 in the tiebreaker for the 
second set. and .1IO just barely missed 
that third set." 

In intercollegiate play. all eeta are 
decided by the first to win six eeta by a 
margin of two. In the cue of a tie at six-
all. a nine point tiebreaker game is 
played to decide the set. A (.6 set 
decided by a 5-4 game is about 81 tight 
81 Lou'U find in collegiate tenni •. 

Metach recovered in the third eet. 
however, and won the last 11 points in 
the match. 

The other close victory came in third 
doubles play. Everett Gee and Ron 
Phillips, playing together for the fir.t 
time this season, went into a lengthy 
conteat with the leam from NMSU 
before winning 7 ·6. 7 ·6. Part of the 
credit for their victory and avoidance of 
a third set goes to the resr afthe players 
on the learn. But Royden led the vocal 

. and emotionailUpport that the players 
offered to Gee and Phillip. in the Ia.t 
part of the second set. 

One-Pitch 
Softball 
Finishes Up 

Intramural one.pitch softball has 
drawn to a close. and to no one's 
surprise the champions of the AAA 
and AA divisions came from among 
the top three seeds going into the 
playoffs. 
~ At first glance No Nuke. may 
appear to have no place in the sports 
section. Upon doter examination. one 
will see that it does as well as any name 
for an AAA softball champion. After 
slugging it out all season. the Banana 
Slug. were scorched by No Nukea 4. 
2. in the title game. • 

The teams were evenly matched 
with several oubtanding piarers on 
each leam. 1ne caliber of play was 
high and both teams were impressive 
on defente. 

"80th teams played well. We lUit 
happened to be a little better. The 
victory was a team effort." said Roger 
Stokla., captain of the newly crowned 

llle other two doubles learn. ,wept 
their victories. Kaukonen and Royden 
breezing throuRh at 6-2, 6.1. and Rick 
Overstreet and Tom Neuman winning 
with an identical score. 
. The Tritons dropped only one match 

in their 8·1 conquest of New Mexico 
State on Friday. Moat of the other. 
were won in .traight eeta, but top seed 
Paul Metsch encountered some 
difficulty before pulling out a narrow 6.

UCSD Offers Coaches a Starting Place 
Two Women Appreciate Opportunity, Athletes Here, but Moving Up Means Moving On 

Two young former 
intercollegiate athletea. Liz 
Dudash and Judy Malone are 
currendy coaching at UCSD. 
Liz Duda.h handlell the 
women', tennis while Malone 
• u~aea women's basket-
ball. 

Duda.Jh. who graduated 
from San Diego State last 
year. wu a member of- the 
Aztec women'. tennis learn,. 
ranked fifth nationaUy. She 
feel. that coaching here i. "a 
lot of fun, but it'. a lot of work. 
But termis hal been my life 10 
it aU come. naturally." 

This coaching position i. 

ideal for Duda.h. She has a 
leaching credential but is still 
.tudying to obtain a master', 
degr:ee. Since coaching for 
UCSD is only part time, llhe 
baa time for both ,tudying and 
coaching . 
. Duduh not only enjoys the 
coadUng. bot feel, that the 
athletic department here i. 
very well run. She wu hired at 
a late date and feared having 
to toil over . la,t-minute 
paperwork. but everything 
had been taken care of. Au she 
had to do was coach. 

Malone too feel. that the 
UCSD athldic department i.

worthy of praise in light of the 
fact that it geta .uch a minimal 
amount of help from the 

. • chool. However, both 
- coaches agree that the athletic 

department could put more 
effort into attracting both 
athletes and coaches to 
UCSD.· . 

"A lot of people who could 
be involved in athletic. aren't 
becau.e it's not worth their 
time." commented Dudash. 

Duda.h found out about the 
opening for a coach here not 
from an adverlieement. but 
from a .upervisor of hera while 
.he W81 student leaching. 

Malone ju.t slipped into her 
position. She began aaaiatant 
coaching women's var.ity 
basketball at UCSD while 
training for the Olympic •. 
When the previous coach left. 
Malone was the logical 
succeslOr. 

Malone i. no stranger to 
UCSD women'. basketball, 
.he played on the Triton learn 

wh~e attending here as a bio 
major. Looking back on her 
day. as a player in contra.t to 
the present, she l8ys~ "Never 
before was tompetition very 
competitive. Now. we're not 
only competitive. we're 

looking toward. regional,." 
Malone feel. that more 
.hould be done to facilitate this 
growth. 

Both of the young coaches 
feel that one of the mo.t 
enjoyable faceta of coaching 
here is the willingness of the 

~ayers. They come out for the 
lOve of the sport. not bec:au.e 
they are being paid to do 10. 
The coaches don't find much 
need te. pu.h and prod; the 
players are very gung.ho. 

One of the incentivea to 
Malone for staying on at 
UCSD is the challenge of

Coaches Comment on' 
UCSD Athletics 

Continued from page 7

players of such varying &kill. 
level •. She mUit build the baaic 
skill, of the le8l-ad\'anced and 
.imultaneously hold the 
interest (.·f the veterans. 

"Anybody can coach a 
leam with a lot of talent. When 
you take a team of what you 
can get and do well, that'. 
rewarding," said Malone . 

Since the athletes are not on 
scholarship, practices must be 
worked around academics, 
which at time. is a difficult 
task. Dudash has found it 
somewhat difficult to adjust to 
the difference in the 
philosophies of San Diego 
State and UCSD. At State, if 
one i. on athletic scholarship, 
athletics is number one on the 
priority Ii.t. At UCSD, the 
athletics mUit be modified to fit 
around academics. 

UCSD is unique in that 
aspect. Because of that, it can 
provide a foothold for young 
coaches as well as for players 
not interested in being on 
scholarship. 

ThUI, many coaches come 
here as rookies . "Where else 
could I go with a degree in 
biology and become the head 
women', basketball coach?" 
asked Malone. 

UCSD is an ide,a1 place for 
aspiring coaches with other 
jobs on the side to embark on 
their careers. An excessive 
amount of experience and time 
is not demanded of them. 

Yet, the same qualities that 
attract these coaches force 
them to leave UCSD if they 
want to make coaching their 
life. Since coaching is a second 
job for most here, it is difficult 
to develop the program as 
much as bOth Malone and 
Dudash would like to. 

This explains the rate of 
turnover among UCSD 
coaches. UCSD seems unsure 
of what kind of athletic 
program it wants. The talent is 
here and teams seem to look 
hesitantly toward higher· level 
competition. To get there, 
though! they need to keep 
coaches and athletes.

several excellent plays at the

Novelist Cyra McFadden', 
original expose on the rituals 
and quirks of Marin County 
residents hits . a responsive 
chord in the funny bones of its 
reader.. Sidney Beckman's 
celluloid film counterpart, 
however, is a .habby and 
shallow effort. 

Screenwriters Rich Eustis 
and Michael Elias attempt to 
condense the novel's 52 
chapter, -into a nice neat 
package. 1be results are a 
mire of dimaxes and anti· 
dimaxes sans proper conflicts 
and build·ups, a barrage of 
underdeveloped characters, 
and an overflow of dialogue 
that prides itself on cramming 
into one sentence as many 
obecenities and sex jokes as 
possible.
