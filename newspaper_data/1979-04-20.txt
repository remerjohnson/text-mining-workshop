CaIPIRG: FedMart Has Lowest Prices 
By Jon Goelz 

Senior Staff Writer 
FedMart has the lowest 

priced groceries in the San 
Diego area, according to a 
soon-to-be released CalPIRG 
survey of area supermarkets. 

The survey determines that 
shoppers, to get the best values 
possible, should l>urcha~e their 
meat, dairy products, cereal 
a nd bakery products, bev-
erages and non-foods frem 
FedMart. nig Bear has the 
cheapest produce and frozen 
foods , Alpha Beta has the best 

value in staples, Vons has the 
least expensi ve processed 
fruits al'ld vegeta bles, and 
Gemco has the lowest priced 
processed foods . 

The survey, compiled and 
made public at least once a 
year since 1973, has sometimes 
had a direct influence on the 
prices at area stores. 

When Alpha Beta was 
pronounced the costliest store 
in 1978, they displayed a poster 
in their store window thanking 
CalPIRG for informing the 
store that their prices were not 

competitive , a ccording to 
survey coordin ator David 
Harris. They then announced 
that they were cutting prices of 
over 2000 items. 

This month Harri says he 
has heard reports that produce 
managers from one of the 
stores with expensive fruits and 
vegeta bles were meeting to 
make their prices more 
competitive also. 

UCSD CalPIRG members 
designed the survey and 
tabulated the results . VOlun-
teers compiled prices of 110 

\' common grocery store 
shopping items" at the eight 
supermarkets . Complete 
results of all the findings will be 
published in this month ' s 
edition of CalPIRG Reports, 
available on campus shortly. 

"The survey does increase 
. competition ," said Harris. 

"The stores really take it 
seriously. It 's really had an 
affect on lowering prices InSan 
Diego." 

The annual survey, con-
ducted March 30 through April 
I, awarded the top honor to 

FedMart for the second year in 
a row. It received the base' 
rating of 100.00. Gemco came in 
second with 102.20 (meaning 
that the same amount of 
groceries bought at FedMart 
for $100 would cost $102 .20 af 
Gemco) . 

nig Bear, rated at 111.10 in 
1978, dropped to 102.40 this 
year. Alpha Beta tied for 
fourth place with Food Mart in 
1979 at 104.00. Vons totaled 
104.50, Safeway 106.00, and 
Mayfair Market was found 

mo~t expensive at 111.70.

SDSU to Lose 65 Faculty Positions 
Systemwi.de 
Council Asks 
13% Faculty 
Rav,-btike 

, 

By Kalhy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

The Academic Council 
suggested to UC President 
David Saxon a 13 percent pay 
increase for all faculty 
members at a meeting here 
Wednesday . 

The council , a committee of 
the systemwide Academic 
Senate which meets each 
month, jOined with Saxon and 
several systemwide adminis-
t ra tors to discuss various 
faculty and academic-related 
topics . 

The council discussed 
increasing faculty salaries by 
a pproximately 13 percent 
because "we're falling way 
behind" other universities in 
their pay scale for faculty. 

According to Council Chair 
William Frazer, UC is 13 
percent behind other uni-
versities in its pay scale and "is 
the farthest behind I can recall 
our being." . 

As a result, UC is losing 
" bright young people" from 
among its faculty. 

Frazer, who is a physics 
pr~essor at UCSD, has "a 
great deal of optJmism" that 
the State Leg~slature will 
approve a pay increase for all 
state employees, which would 
include all UC faculty . 

Although Governor Jerry 
Brown could veto a pay 
increase, " a great deal of 
pressure from the labor 
movement" should convince 
Drown to support a ise in sta 
e mployees ' sa lar aid 
Frazer. 

Frazer remarked that such 
an increase in salary would be 
conformed to comply with 
P reSident Carter's wage 
guidelines.

Striking Boston" U Faculty Settle, 
Clerical Strike Still Disrupts 

By Eric Har~1I 
SCaff Wrl&er 

Boston University remains 
"partially disabled" as a result 
of an eight day faculty and 
clerical strike earlier this 
month, Michael McKeon of the 
American Association of 
University Professors (AAUP) 
at Boston said Wednesday . 

Classrooms continue to be 
disrupted, despite settlement of 
the strike earlier this week. 
"They're holding classes out on 
the lawn ," said McKeon . 
" Many' faculty members a re 
unwilling to cross the picketing 
line of the still s triking clerical 
workers ." 

The strike, which began on 
April 5, was a n attempt by the 
faculty to persuade the board of . 
trustees to accept a union 
contract negotiated ea rlier 
between faculty and adminis-
tration. l~ shut down the 
university completely for its 

ration. 
e McKeon's claim that 

claalles are not (unctioning 

normally, Bob Berheim of the 
Boston board of trustees says 
"everything's going pretty 
much as usual.. .the clerical 
strike should be over in a few 
days and then everything will 
be just as it was." 

McKeon and Bergheim also 
disagreed on the nature of the 
contract dispute. The major 
point of disagreement con-
cerned sthe Trustees ' surprise 
rejection of a contract proposal 
to which both faculty and 
representa tives of the board of 
trustees had previously agreed. 

According to Be rgheim, the 
rejection by the t rustees was 
due to " clarification of minor 
points." Howeve r , McKeon 
said the reason for the rejection 
was "a premedita ted attempt 
on the pa rt of orne Trustee to 
avoid signing a contract, and at 
the same time avert a possible 
strike." McKeon feels that the 
trustee plan backfired, and 
provoked the faculty and 
clerical starr to take action. 

The strike, which Mc~eon 

termed "very successful ," 
persuaded administrators to 
sign the contract, which will 
grant faculty a thirty eight 
percent raise over the next 
three years . The clerical 
workers are still trying to get 
their union contract accepted 
by the Board of Trustees . 

The negotiations represent 
the first attempt on the part of 
Boston University workers to 
unionize, despite a law enacted 
in 1975 whi c h gr a nt e d 
university personnel the right 
to e ng a g e in c oll ec ti ve 
bar ga ins. . 

Th e Hi g he r Educatio n 
Empl oyee Re latio n Act 
(HEERA) , which goe into 
effect on July 1, will gra nt UC 
employee the right to vote on 
wheth r or not they wish to 
engage in collective ba r-
gaining. 

The effect HEERA will have 
on faculty negotiations i 
unknown. However, a state-
ment published in the UCSD 

(PI ,urn ,.,pale 14) 

divided about evenly between 
across-the-board cuts in the 
university 's other ix colleges, 
to be named by the respective 
deans, and " programatic" cuts 

-COllie from five of seven 
departments Day name d 
earlier this year to be studied 
for po sible elimination. 

The new plan conta ins 
severa l compromises from his 
original " hit list" propo a \. The 
number of layoCCs of tenured 
faculty will be significantly 
reduced by allowing across-
the-board cuts, which can be 
made by not rehiring tem-
porary faculty . By lea ving 
parts of the depa rtments intact, 
he also allowed majors to 
continue their course of study, 
satisfying. a major objection of 
student groups to the original 
concept. 

Day also bowed to pressure 
from the community fn naming 
no cuts from the Nursing and 
Mechani ca l Engineering 
program, two of the ' seven 
originally named. 

Departments which will be 
cut are industrial studies, 
natural science, athletics 
(academic credit courses) , and 
a new combination of the social 
welfare and health science and 
safety programs. 

Day said he expects the 
university's financial diffi-
culties to continue for a least a 
few years. Falloffs in the 
number of high chool and 
graduate students (primarily 
in education), have created an 
enrollment decline that will 
take years to reverse with 
increasing number of non-
traditional student , he said. 
The nation' economic troubles 
also cramp funds , and Can b 
expected to continue , he added.

Nuke Defense Draws Six Responses 
Editor: 

I was appalled by Scott 
McBride's BUb response to the 
current nuclear ener,y 
c..'Ontroveny (Guanllu 4/13) . 
He complains vehemenUy that 
we are beiDi persuaded by 
"fear and superstition:" then, 
be ironically attempts to allay 
our fears with more fear, more 
superstition and a plethora of 
pseudo-scientific assertions 
dlsguiaed as facts .

lent construction reports and 
falsified inspections on safety

the technology, such con-
struction flaws cannot be 
overcome.

last Ice Age carved the 
Yosemite Valley out of solid 
granite; what makes u's think 
that a small steel tank will 
withstand glacial pressure? 
This may sound silly, but the 
future 01' thIS planet could very 

Thirdly, McBride argues that easily be contaminated by this

sible for our latest accident, Destruction or leakage of

must build and run these ' land. Even if the technology 
reactors, so their operation will exists. again it is not being 

implemented, for the reasons of 
economy I gave before. 

Finally, McBride argues that 
progress will be denied if we 
discourage nuclear develop-
ment. Progress is not sacred of 
itself; it is only good if it serves 

. a purpose . Nuclear energy 
serves no purpose but to 
endanger us while offering 
redundant conveniences . 
Developing nuclear power 
" just for the heck o( it" is 
absurd. I' m not willing to 
support such a gamble. 

In short, McBride charges 
a nti-nuclear advocates with 
spreading . fear and super-
stition . He then promulgates a 
strategy which is far more ' 
dangerous - the use of 
reasonable -sounding but 
baseless aRd distorted 
information to convey the 
impression that he supports a 

factually-bas~d, logical 
conclusion. It is this type of 
hysteria that we should beware 
of.

be subject to human error. This ~--------------= ___ ---::-===-==============;;;;;::;;_iiii"---, 
is a fact of life. We cannot 
ignore human fallibility , so the 
danger of accidents is still too 
high to be acceptable. 

Fourthly, McBride asserts 
that we have no other 
alternative (uel sources but 
nuclear. Tha' is false . First, . 
electrical demand is declining, 
so the demand for nuclear 
power is declining. Next, we 
have several other sources of 
power: solar energy, geother-
mal energy, natural gas - the 
technology for all these sources 
exists now. Why aren't we using 
them? We aren't developing 
them. The energy industry has 

I take issue with McBride on 
six general issues. First of all 
be argues that the chances of 
nuclear accidents are slight, 
and be refers to the "most 
widely-quoted" Rasmussen 
study, done some years ago on 
the safety of nuclear energy. 
Interestingly enougb, the U.S. 
,overnment withdrew its 
backlnl from that study 
montbs a,o; critics have 
assailed it for years. The 
rea oo! So many potential 
causes for accidents (human 
error, faulty construction, 
corrupt inspectlon) were 
neglected that the study is 
useless. Numerous accidents 
have occurred, proving its 
conclusions false. Incidentally, 
the study reported that the 
cbaRces of a reactor meltdown 
were the same as two loaded 
747s coUidiDg. Th.t bappened 
less tban two years ago, 
resulting in a tralic loss of life. 
Besides all tbat, one chance is

consequences. 

a very significant investment in 
nuclear energy today ; to shift 
to another source would be 
financially disastrous to the 
utilities and to corporations 
that have sunk millions into 
nukes. Incidentally, the same 
companie» control the 
development of all these 
sources - nuclear and its 
alternatives. As a final 
alternative , , there is con-
servation - a step which none 
o( us would like, but one. 
preferable to the dangers we 
face with nuclear power. 

Tenure Editorial Blasted 
Secondly, McBride argues 

that tecbnology will improve 
sufficiently to cover any 
dangers. This is quite an 
assumption, one which has no 
basis in fact; we cannot see into 
the future to project our 
scientific breakthroughs . So 
the technology is not guaran-
teed. Meanwhile, we see the 
nuclear industry insisting on 
rapid, haphazard development, 
regardless of our ability to 
handle emergencies. If the 
technology is not developed, too 
bad, for the United States 
already will be so committed to 
nuclear power that 'we cannot 
feasibly change our policies. 
And even if the technology 
could be developed, there is a 
great deal of doubt that it would 
be implemented . Why? 
Because the builders of 
reactors and the utilities are 
concerned about economy, not 
safety. The NRC recently 

Fifthly, McBride assumes 
away all nuclear harms to our 
future generations by saying, 
"Well , look how bad off we'd be 
without it." Because of other 
energy sources and domestic 
oil decontrol , we probably 
won" be that bad off. But 
McBride neglects the precise 
(uture harm of nuclear power. 
The most compelling reason to 
shun nuclear energy is the 
problem of wasle disposal. So 
(ar, there's no way to get rid of 
the radioactive material, 
except to bury it somewhere. 
The same goes for decom-
missioned nuclear plants. This 
material is radioactive for 
millions of years,. enough time

Coors Not 
Adequate 
Editor: 

Last quarter The Guardian 
ran a (ront-page story under the 
headline " Coors Working 
Conditions Found Adequate." 
We've been awaiting a 
response, but since there's been 
none we're making our own. 

Maybe it's just naivete, but 
we do not see how any work 
which requires a person to take 
a lie detector test can honestly 
be termed " adequate." The 
day such conditions are found 
generally acceptable is a sad 
day indeed. 

Also, since th e judgment on 
the working conditions was a 

,preliminary one made by a few 
Stanford students , the headline 
was fragmenta ry and mis-
leading. The story itself failed 
to mention that the eleCtion at 
Coors against the union was 
questionable in that only strike 
breaker were allowed to vote. 
The union members , the 
original Coors workers who 
went out on strike. not over 
economic issue but over 
matters of human dignity , were 
barred from voting.

is a highly secretive, almost 
claustrophobic process." That 
may be true, but it doesn't 
mean students, undergraduate 
and graduate, are not capable 
of understanding how it works. 

You say that "any student 
who tells you that Bob Edelman 
should get tenure probably 
doesn't know what he or she is 
talking about." Leaving aside 
the important question of how 
you accomplished your mind-
reading, tbis all'egation 
appears to dismiss out-of-hand. 
any efficacy students could 
have. But that doesn 't stop you, 
you go on to advise the same 
people who don't know what 
they're talking about to 
"continue to publicly register 
(their) dissatisfaction with bow 
tenure is granted." Presum-
ably so they can be told they 
don't know what they're talking 
about. 

You question the intelligence 
not only of students as you ask 
what "instructions the six 
professors from other uni-
ver'sities were given in 
evaluating his work .'" One 
would think that an Impartial 
instruction would simply ask 
for fair evaluations based on 
the professors' expertise, 
trusting their experience in 
tenure decisions. What specific 
instruction would the majority 
of the senior faculty in the 
History Dept. have been 
satisfied with? One requesting 
negative reviews? 

Finally , any fair-minded 
person could reasonably ask, if 
Edelman did not fit into the 
department's intellectual play 
(a possibility you pose), why be

convened at UCSD. 

The council normally m eets 
prior to the Regents' monthly 
meetings in Los Angeles or 
Berkeley. Because the Regents 
did not meet this month , Frazer 
asked the Council to convene 
here. 

As an advisory body to Saxon, 
the council discuss sand 
consults with him "on the wide 
variety of matters" pertaining 
to UC academics, according to 
Frazer. 

Frazer said that the council 
came here because of his

Science-

·Nobel Winner Tries' To Control DNA 
By Doug Campion 

Science Editor 1959 Prize Holder Gives Med School Lecture the RNA polymerase initiated the chain, it had included the 
uracil in place of the necessary 
component, tbymine. Before 
the DNA completes-replication, 
it is " policed" by enzymes 
whicb clip out of the molecule 
the improper subunits and then 
break the bonds where these 
contaminents once existed. 
After removing tbe uracil , 
then, the DNA Kornberg bad 
been following through 
replication was essentially 
broken apart. 

Speaking about the back-
ground and recent develop-
ments in his field of speciali-
zation, Nobel laureate Arthur 
Kornberg, M.D., addressed an ' 
audience of UCSD Medical 
School students and faculty 
yesterday in Garren Audi-
torium on the subject of DNA 
replication, the manner in 
which cells reproduce their own 
genetic materia l. 

Kornberg , currently a 
professor of biochemistry at 
Stanford University, received 
the Nobel Prize in 1959 for his 
co-discovery with Severo 
Ochoa of the enzyme DNA 
polymerase, the substance 
within the cell which uses 
existing DNA molecules as 
" templates" a nd produces 
exact copies of the gene-
carrying macromolecule. 
. Kornberg explained that now 
it is known that several forms of 
DNA polymera'se exi s t in 
nature . 

Co mpa ring the function of the 
genetic material DNA within 
an organism to the force 
directing operations of some 
intricate machine , Kornberg 
said, " We won 't get a full 
understanding of this ma-
chinery unless we know how it's 
controlled. " This, he said, was 
his basic motivation in 
attempting to derive the exact 
process by which DNA is 

replicated . 
By a llowing specific types of 

bacteriophages to enter into 
bacteria such as E. coli , 
Kornberg studied the process of 
replication step by step. One of 
the mechanisms he discovered 
involved the coa ting of the viral 
DNA loop with a " binding 
protein ," which leaves only one 
pa rticular portion of the 
molecule exposed and acces-
sible to the polymerase. 

DNA polymerase, however, 
can Otlly work to extend a 
genetic c hain whi ch ha s -
already been initiated. This 
fact puzzled geneticists for 
yea rs , although sev e r a l 
hypotheses did exist as to how 
the reproduction of DNA was 
begun. Kornberg's work has 
proven one of these hypotheses 

. true. Noting th at " RNA 
polyme ra se has a unique 
capacity to sta rt chains," the 
biochemist explained that it is 
this enzyme and not DNA 
polymerase which begins the 
process of DNA replication. 

The RNA poly meras e 
attaches to what Kornberg 
referred to as the "hairpin" of 
DN A left expose!i by the 
binding protein. There , 
according to Kornberg , it 
" makes a start that DNA 
polymerase will extend. " 

In the more complex case of a 

double strand of DNA, a 
variation of this mechanism 
was observed. First, enzymes 
broke a specific bond in the 
double-helix strand and the two 
twisted molecules "unzipped" 
from that point. Kornberg and 
his colleagues expected the 
remaining single-strand circle 
of DNA to act as a template for 
replication exactly as had 
ha ppened in the simple r 

instance. " Youcanimagineour 
di sappointment when we 
isolated this circle, added the 
ingredients , and it didn't 
work," said Kornberg. 

After further experimenta-
tion, Kornberg discovered the 
problem. During the synthesis 
of "new" DNA, some uracil had 
contaminated the system. 
Uracil is a component of RNA, 
but is not found in DNA . When 

Agri-Waste Potent Energy Source 
DAVIS - If California's 

annual 27 million tons of 
agricultural residues could be 
converted into fuel for energy, 
they would equal 65 million 
barrels of oil - about 19 percent 
of California 's present annual 
production of oil. 

A team of researchers from 
the University of California at 
Davis surveyed rice growers 
a nd orcha rdists in Sutter, 
lJutte , Colusa and Fresno 
counties. The UC researchers 
found tha t the farmers would 
welcome this type of an energy-
producing program if their 
farms could be rid of such 
wastes without interfering with 
normal operations. The key to 
farmer acceptance would be 
" practicality," especially the 
timing and procedures used in 

., 
'I< 

collecting the prunings and rice 
straw. 

John R. Goss, professor of 
agricultural engineering at UC 
Davis, has developed experi-
mental gasifiers capable of 
using nut shells, corn cobs and 
wood chips as fuel for power 
generation . H«: says that 
California crop-drying plants 
and a number of public utility 
firms already recognize the 
high potential of such materials 
as a stable source of fuel for 
their power needs . 

" Costs of petroleum and 
natural gas keep rising," he 
says , "so if unwanted 
by products of food and timber 
production can be turned into 
fuel for power generation at 
reasonable cost, we ' ll help 
solve two problems: how to 

achieve more efficient disposal 
of agricultural wastes, and bow 
to lessen our dependence on 
fossil fuels ." 

Goss explains that the 
surveys went only to rice 
growers and orchardists in the 
four counties because rice 
straw and tree prunings at this 
time have the highest 
immediate potential for use in 
large, central power plants. 

Those responding to the 
survey, be reports, are more 
interested in long-term 
commitments to a systematic 
collection of farm waste 
materials than in making a 
profit, although they would be 
glad to share in profits if utility 
eompanies become successful 
in the venture.

Th. 

By Jon Goetz 
Senior Staff Wrher 

Sometimes John Serrano 
wakes up with the feeling that 
he's got aboot ten things going 
at once. 

Like this morning. He 's got 
the discus, shot put, javelin, 
high jump, long jump, pole 
vault, 100 meter run, 400 meter 
run, 1S00 meter run, and the 110 
meter high hu'rdles to 
concentrate on. 

And the Warren College 
freshman likes it that way. "It 
keeps me from getting bored," 
he said. 

Today and tomorrow Serrano 
competes in his third 
decathlon, at Cal Poly Pomona. 
It won't be his last either. He ' ll 
compete in theNAIA Division 3 
finals in May, and, with a 

. qualifying score in one of the 
last two decathlons, at the 
NAIA Nationals in Ohio. 

The decathlon seemed the 
natural event for the thin 6'4" 
track team member. He has 
competed in some eight" events 
this season for UCSD, winning 
the 200 meter run , open 400 
meter run, 400 intermediate 
hurdles, and running the fastest 
110 high hurdles of the day at 
the Redlands Invitational. 

"I was having some success 
in a lot of running events," he 
said, "and I figured anyone 
could do the field events. (A 
decathlon) seemed like a lot of 
fun ." 

So Serrano entered his first 
decathlon while running for

standina performance, secured

doubles matches. Lan Ngoc Ta 
romped lint singles player Kit 
Keith of San Diego Slale HoO, 
11-0. Following ,uit, Jane 
Orbuch rampaged State's third 
sinales 11-1, H-I, and fourth 
slnales Cindy King won 11-3,11-
O. 

Playing women's second 
singlet, Linda Fried edged past 
ber opponent In a three-game 
bout. She set and won the first 
game, 2-1, gave up the second, 
I-n, and came back in the 
third, 11-7, contributing to ther 
Triton triumph. 

In women's doubles action, 
Ta and Orbuch teamed up for a 
toUlh doubles battle, winning 
15-4,4-15, 15-4 in the number one 
slot. The pair of Fried and King 
routed State's second doubles, 
15-4, 15-4. 

According to Coach Mike 
Vander Grlend, "The women 
are doing an excellent Job. I am 
extremely satisfied with their 
play." 

In his biggest win of the 
season, Hal Jacobs defeated 
San Diego's powerful top 
singles player, Jose Mag-

saysay in a hard fought effort, 
12-15, 18-14, 15-6. Earlier this

Ruggers Finish 6th 
In S8 'Tournament 

With three wins and two 
losses the UCSD men's rugby 
team finished in sixth place out 
of 32 teams in the gold division 
of last weekend's Santa 
Barbara Rugby. Tournament. 

I nits fir s t' gam eon 
Saturday morning it was a 
battIe of the drop kickers, as the 
only scoring in the Triton 
victory came from two 
dropkicks made by Dave Kahn 
and Don Famojion. 

Advancing to the second 
game, the UCSD squad had a 
sligbt edge over the Santa Cruz 
Rebels. The Rebels repeatedly 
used an effective kicking game 
to escape from their half of the 
field, but it wasn't enough to 

keep the Tritons away from a 
10-8 victory. 

Jeff Jones scored for a try, 
after a blocked Rebel punt 
attempt and also successfully 
completed the conversion kick. 
Mark Lochtefeld outran five 
Santa Cruz players to the 
endzone for the second and final 
Triton try. 

In Saturday 's third game the 
UCSD team couldn't put out the 
effort, getting trounced by the 
Santa Barbara Grunions, 0-9 . 
Mistakes ina'riton territory led 
to two successful penalty kicks 
for the Grunion. San Diego's 
back were able to contain the 
SB backfield, pressuring them

Poet Snyder Offers Tribal Vision 
Pulitzer Prize Winner Remains Optimistic 

By Charles Heimler. 
Gary Snyder, Pulitzer Prize-

winning poet, Zen Buddhism student 
and committed friend of the earth , 
offered his vision of this planet's 
ecological future at his lecture and 
poetry reading Wednesday . 

While Snyder has always presented 
an optimistic preview of our older age 
in idealistic songs, chants and prose , 
his latest work incorporates a 
deepening interest in the world's tribal 
peoples. Consequently, he stylistically 
utilizes the folklore of Asiatic and 
Native American people in modern 
.language. 

An enthusiastic and responsive 
assemblage of people heard Snyder 
present a lecture on "Poetry, 
Community. and Climax" in the late 
afternoon, followed by a poetry 
reading at night, during which he 
melodically sung several poems 
including "The Wild Mushroom" -

If you look out under oak trees 
Or around an old pine stump 
You'U know a mushroom's coming 
By the way the leaves are humped 
They send out multiple fibers 
Through the roots and sod 
Some make you mighty sick they 

say 
Or bring you close to God 
So here's to the mushroom family 
A far-flung friendly clan 
For food, for fun, for poison 
They are a help to man . 

For Snyder, the mushroom and the 
concept of ecological climax are 
among the keys to a California 
meta physics which students, staff and 
community members - San Diego's 
poetry network - warmly received at 
the two events. c()-sponsored by the 
Archive for New Poetry and Muir 
Wilderness / Cultural Tr a ditions 
program. 

Snyd er was introduced as a 
" gestura l" poet by Literature Prof. 
Michael Davidson, who described him 
as a part of the San Francisco 
Renaissance which flourished in the 
1950s. Snyder over the course of three 
decades has emerged from his Beat 
beginnings while supporting 
magazines such as Alcherenga, Co-
Evolution Quarterly and numerous 
small presses, and his appearance for 
many transcended the gap between 

hi ~ incarnation as Japhy Ryder, 
Kerouac 's outdoorsman character in 
The Dharma Bums, and his work in 
the seventies. 

Politically, Snyder is an old-
fashioned anarchist, mistrustful of 
centralized bureaucracies and 
institutionS. His "watershed" politics 
have collected in a bio-regional 
consciousness in which "rootedness" 
(staying put for a while in one place) 
produce both poetry and a freedom 
from fossil-fuel economies. 

This poetic consciousness Snyder 
developed in several of the 
unpublished poems he read through 
which he drew an analogy between the 
use of recycling in both literature and 
in the biological world. 

His Zen Buddhist side was visible in 
his proposition that one may go into 
the future or the past at will or to many 
places at one time through the 
possibilities of linguistic diversity. 

If Snyder sometimes drifted into 
philosophical speculations , he 
delicately returned to the concrete 
earth in his poems based upon his 
experiences as a California Arts 
Council Commissioner and in his 
concluding "Pledge of Allegiance" to 
the soil of Turtle Island (the ancient 
Indian name.for North America) . 

Snyder said he 'd use the fee he 
received for his UCSD appearances to 
help a community project in the Sierra 
Nevada hamlet in which he lives. 

" Each community member is 
giving four weeks' earnings to build a 
long-house," he explained, "in which 
we can have meditation, readings and 
community meetings. They came to 
me and told me they wanted me to do a 
week's worth oC poetry readings to 
raise my share. So today'spay isgoing 
to building materials."

H'amnier's Delusions of Rock Adequacy' 

By S&aallonda 

F Or those that remember the Jan Hammer of old (i.e. duriJII and before 
Jeff Beek) , be iI DOt 10 be found 
on Blaek Sbee,. Iutead, the 
jazl keyboardiat .... tumed to 
delUilons of rock and roll 
ltardom with only mediocre 
result.. 

An anaoucement on the inner 
a1eeve states that "there Is no 
Iultar on tbia album," and yet 
Hammer tries In vain to make 
biB syntheaiJen and keyboards 
emulate p.itar parts. For a 
man with an Incredible amount 
of talent on a Mlnimoog or 
electric piano, Black Sbeep 
comes out as a waste of vinyl. 

"Manic Depression," a Jlmi 
Hendrix piece, probably stands 
out as the best rocker of the nine 

cuts (perhaps due to the fact 
that Hammer did not write it). 
The otber tunes make a stab at 
the rock 'n' roll sound but fall 
100 sbort to he good. With better 
material, Hammer can go far. 

Montha after his blockbuster 
TwiD So .. of DiffereD' Mo&ben 
witb Dan Fogelberg, Tim 
Weisberg has come out with 
another winner in Night Rider. 

This solo effort is a mix of 
prOiresslve, pop; jazz and rock 
that would be difficult for 
anyone to disHke. The "Special 
Lyric Sheet" contains 
absolutely no lyrics at all, a fact 
that does not diminish the 
album one bit. Without words to 
get · in the way, Weisberg's 
brilliance as a Dutist ~bows 
throughout.

Production on the album Is 
e.ccellent with clean sound

The latest attempt by

a ttempt at using the sa me mold

Their trademark of rhythmic

. present in this album and 
becomes boring after a while. 

Very few innovative ideas 
are tried by the quintet whose 
Crime of the Century remains 
their best work to date. 
" Logical Song," while good, is 
just another extention of many 
.of the group's past songs. "Just 

Another Nervous Wreck" and 
"Casual Conversations" on 
Side Two hold hope for saving 
the album with fair to good 
guitar parts. 

Breakfast In America will be 
appealing to the longtime

Film/Beth Accomando 

'Field Fails to Sustain 'Norma Rae' 
S trong women's roles have been too long neglected by Holly-

wood and the recent flow of 
quality women's films is only 
beginning to make up Cor the 
deficit. With Norma Rae, 20th 
Century-Fox continues to 
distribute films centered 
around fem a le characters. 
However, unlike their other 
fil ms (Turning Point, Julia, An 
Unmarried Woman) . Norma 
Rae fails to cast the pivotal role 
with an actress who can carry 
an entirc pi cture 01' overcome 
the rilm's fl aws. 

The story of Norma Rac is a 
loose adaptation of a true 
incident that took place in 
No rth Carolina duringtheearly 
70s and involved a woman 
named Crystal Lee Jordan. 
No rma Rae, like Jordan, is a 
poorly educated woman who 
joins up with a union organizer 
and then struggles to unionize 
her textile plant. In addition to 
their problems on the job, both 
women faced difficulties a t 
home because of the.ir new 

the Plebian 

social awareness. When the 
film gets down to specifics 
about N'orma Rae then it relies 
more on what will make a good 
story and what will sell rather 
than on what Jordan was truly 
like. 

Despite some negative 
elements in her environment 
Norma Rae's story has a 
fundamental optimism . 
Instead of remaining stagnant, 
Norma Rae moves from being a 
pas ive bystander to being an 
active participator s triving for 
what she feels i a worthwhile 
goal. Norma Rae also has an 
uncynical per pective that ees 
good triumphing over bad and 
people changing for the better. 

In the Irving Ravetch -
Harriet Frank Jr . script 
situations are resolved too 
neatly and easily, and the 
characters are too sketchy. 
Norma Rae's husband , for 
instance, is merely a limp 
puppet who does whatever best 
suits the needs of the plot. The 
writers, who seem to have a 
genuine affection for their 

Contemporary Jewelry 
Gold and Silver Repairs 

Engraving 

834 kline street 
La Jolla, CA 454-1888 

subject , do achieve some 
success as , for example, in the 
platonic but loving relationship 
between Norma Rae and labor 
organizer Reuben Warshovsky. 

The major disapP9intment of 
Norma Rae is t~e central 
performance by Sally Field. 
Field, a competent actress in 
light dra ma a nd supporting 
roles, a pp a r in almost every 
scene and her ta lents cannot 
sustain the film. Her continual 
presence only reveals her 
limi ta tion in facial and vocal 
expression : her cute but bland 
appeara nce, coupled with a 
monotonous Southem accent, 
soon prove tiresome and a 
serious hindrance to the film . 

Despite good intentions on 
the part of the cast and crew, 
Norma Rae falls short of its 
potenti al. Norma Rae ' s 
indecision as to what it really 
wants to explore - the unions, a 
character or the injustices of a 
textile plant - leaves the film 
with an air of incompleteness.

Nllh&. The seven-memoo'r band 
makes wide use of a piano and 
backin, vocal much Uke the 
American group. 

Unfortun.ately. the two 
women in the group. Katherine 
Lapthorn and Irene Linders are 
relegated to only background 
parts' and the audience is not 
allowed to hear them outfront. 
The remainder of the band 
seems talented. but do not 
reach their full potential while 
wallowing in bad mixing. 

The overall tone is of a 
pop/rock nature . though 
definitely not Top 40.

(Conlinued from page 10) 
to kick. 

According to team captain 
Jeff Jones. "San Diego played 
one of their best games as a 
team this year against the 
Grunions. who finished in 
second place for the whole 
tournament. " 

The Tritons came back on 
Sunday to shut out the Santa 
Clara Missions. 0 ... . in a game 
totally dominated by San 
Diego. Pete Thomson and 
Famojion scored for the team. 

In their fifth and final game 
of the tournament local rivals 
Del Mar out kicked UCSD. 10-0. 

Boston 
Dispute 
(Conlinued from page I) 
sian Gazelle indicated that a 
strike similar to the campus-
wide one at Boston is not 
foreseen here. Since funding for 
salaries at UC campuses must 
come from the state legis-
lature. court injunctions and 
arbitration initiated by the state 
would serve as detemmts to 
potential strikes within the UC 
system. Boston University does 
not get state funding.

First lesson: 
Bonded Bourbon is so 
unique that it took an 
act .of Congress (in 1897) 
to establish the 
standards for 
Old Grand-Dad 
and other Bonded 
whiskeys. 

Old Grand-Dad Bonded 
is authentic Kentucky sour-mash 
Bourbon, made with pure limestone 
water, the finest grains, and aged in new 
charred-oak barrels. 

Only Bonded 
whiskeys have a green 
tax stamp. It's your guar-
antee that the whiskey is 
at least four years old. 

. Old Grand-Dad Bonded is 
always aged longer. 

100 is perfect. 
Bonded Bourbon 
must be 100 proof. 
No more. No less. 

Final exam. 
Xou need only one 
SIp to recogruze 
the clearly superior 
quality and taste of 
Old Grand-Dad.
