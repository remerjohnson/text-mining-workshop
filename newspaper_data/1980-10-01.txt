Armitage Refuses Reg Fee 
ComDlittee Student Members 

First Time He Has Taken Such A ction 
BY KATHY HUFFER 

In a rare administrative 
mov e, Vi ce Chan cellor 
Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage has refused to 
summarily accept this year's 
student appointments to the 
Registration Fee Committee. 

It is the first time Armitage 
has not accepted student 
appointments to the 
committee. 

Armitage last Thursday 
decided to withhold approval 
until a decision is made on 
whether or not to accept a 
recent administrative proposal 
that could give him authority 
to make direct student 

a~intments. 
The committee consists of 

students, staff and faculty and 
advises Armitage on the 
allocation of student 
registration fees. 

Committee Chairwoman 
Cathy Valerio said last night 
she is "not too happy" with 
Armitage's move.

Congressional District 
candidate Tom Metzger 
presented a toned down 
version of his ultra -
conservative politics 
yesterday in a speech before a 
group of Sears University 
Towne Centre employees. 

Metzger offered his views 
on illegal aliens, rent control,

Although he said he 

avoided some subjects 
because he wished only to 
"address the issues," Metzger 
did tie in most of what he said 
on the problems .of "foreign 
infiltration" into economic and 
physical territory of "the 
midd le and lower class 
whites." 

Metzger also repeated his 
belief that a military corridor 
should be established on the 
Mexican-American border 
and that alegal aliens crossing 
into that territory "should be 
shol."

According to Valerio , 
Armitage refused to accept the 
four college council, one AS 
and one Graduate Student 
Counca appointees "so that he 
can appoint the committee." 

The proposal calls for the 
elimination of student 
appointments to the 
committee. Instead, student 
members would directly be 
selected by Armitage. 

In addition, the number of 
committee members would be

Dr. Joseph Watson , 
provost of Third and head of 
the campus Affirmative 
Action Office, blames 
UCSD's recruitment programs 
and the Office of Relations 
with Schools for the failure to 
meet minority enrollment 
goals. 

Watson says his Affirma-
tive Action office "has had no 
role to play" in the 
s hortcomings regarding 
minority enrollment. 

The function of the 
Affirmative Action office has 
been to set goals and suggest 

Watson says he hopes that 
recent "major organizational 
changes" will result in 
improvement in minority 
student enrollment. 

"The matter has not been 
taken sufficiently seriously in 
the past and has not been 
treated as an administrative 
objective of reasonable 
priority. It has been looked 
upon as a social-welfare type 
of f!rogram ." 

Watson believes that much 
more than "good intentions" 
are needed - that the issue 
"has to be judged in terms of 
the Chancellor's committment 
to achieve certain goals in 
terms of enrollment of minority 
students this year." He is running against 

Republican incumbent Clair 
Burgener in the 43rd, which 
includes UCSD. 

Conspicuously absent from 
Metzger's speech were his

When asked how successful 
he felt the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee has been in 
attracting minority students, 
Watson says that "in general, 
students will never have as 
much success in recruiting 
other students to the campus 
as professionals do. One 
doesn ' t have traditional 
students go out and recruit 
white students to the campus, 
so why should one expect 
minority students to be that 
effective in recruiting minority

Annitage and Reg Fee 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard Annitage 

has been a proponent of increased student involvement in 
campus deciaion·making procedures since he assumed 
olfice two years ago. Ii is ironic, then, that he should 
support a proposal that undermines student inOuence on 
the Re,iatration Fee Committee, perhaps the most 
important student budgetary committee on campus. 

And not only that, the proposal comes as a result of a 
"sununer retreat " attended strictly by administrators. No 
atuclents were invited; few were even notified. 

'The proposal calls for pneral restructuring of the Reg 
Fee Committee. Three changes in particular are importa,nt 
to addreu. 

Farst, ~e suggests that a reduction in Reg Fee 
members would 'increase the efficiency" of the committee 
and cut cIisc:uAion he thinks is unnecessary. We agree with 
the Chairwoman 01 the Reg Fee Committee, Cathy 
Valerio, who feels fewer members would hamper the 
committee', ability to thorou8hly examine all budget 
options. Allocating the five rniIIIoii Reg Fee budget is no 
I11I8II task. 

Armitage aIao finds fault with the current Reg Fee 
c:ommittee selection j)I'OCe ... Each college, the Associated 
SIudents and the Graduate Student Council appoint a 
lludent representative to the Reg Fee Committee, 
according to university policy. 

Armitage suggests this procedure ignores important 
membenhip aiteria such as ethnicity, sex and experience. 
He propoeea appointing the committee himself from lists 
.. bmitted by the same bodies. 

Does Armitage auume then that elected bodies in the 
c:oUece' are Ie.. concerned with repreaenliruz the widest 
range pouible of special interests than he"? If so, we 
c1ia ... 

FNIIy, Armitage's proposal further threatens student 
input on the Reg Fee Committee _ ~y eliminating the 
parantee of a student chairperson. We find this totally 
unacceptable, as occupation of that position by a faculty or 
staff member would abolish what authority students now 
have on budget policies. 

Perhaps more disturbing than the proposal's content is 
how is was formulated. To deny students participation in 
the formulation of a proposal affecting a committee 10 
crucial to ,tudents interests is wrong. Armitage says 
students weren't invited to the exclusive "summer retreat" 
because administrators who partook in the discussions 
"won't speak frankly with some students" and "wanted to 
sit down as a family." 

Should students be denied acce .. to meetings because 
administrators don't feel comfortable talking with them? 
That reasoning is absurd. 

In yesterday'l editorial, a typographical error relulted in the 
incorrect reporting of $15,000 as the amount transfered from 
Campus Activity Fees to bring The Daily Guardian account into 
balance. 1he figure .hould have read $17,000 . We regret any 
confusion caused by this.

Some Thoughts on Missiles 

Editor: 
I would like to place before 

my fellow students some 
additional thoughts on nuclear 
arml that Geoffrey Brown 
(Daily Guardian, Sept. 29) did 
not note in his opinion piece. 

Mr. Brown states that it 
would only take 100 RUilian 
missiles (he doe. not state if 
thil figure il in conventional 
lill&le warhead missles or 
MIRV'. - Multiple Independ-
ently. Targetable Re·entry 
Vehicles) to do catastrophic 
damage. 

1he thing that Mr, Brown 
does not lay i. that if the 
Rusaiana lbuck firlt they 

would undoubtedly first fire at 
our missiles (with hopes of 
eliminating our return 
capabilities). And the RUI-
sians' second strike would be 
aimed at industry. 

This is one of two key 
reasons that I can see for reo 
targeting. So that we can, 
even after being hit with a 
surprise attack, respond with 
our , own strike that could 
protect our industry. 

The second reallon is this: a 
strike on a missile silo can 
actually produce more 
radiation than a direct attack 
on a city because yo~ not only 
have the launched warhead 

exploding, but you also have 
the unlaunched warhead. 

If one would like more 
infonnation on this aspect. 
Scientific American has 
published .everal articles in 
the last few year. on this 
subject, including a detailed 
article on the effect of a 
Russian strike on our own silos 
and the radiation that would 
follow_ 

In closing, I would like to 
say that I do not look forward 
to a nuclear war any more 
than Mr. Brown doe., but the 
issue of nuclear arms and 
defense is too large and

Bible and Context 
Editor: 

With regards to the letter 
entitled "God and Politics: a 
Dangerous Combination" 
(Dailv Guardian, Sept. 29): 
1he only way a statement can 
possibly J)e dangerous il if it is 
interpreted in a dangerous 
manner. And taking a 
statement out of context il the 
most useful way of making it 
sound "dangerOUl." Indeed, 
the author of the above-
mentioned letter has taken the 
pasl8F of Roman. 13:2 
completely out of context. It is 
virtually impossible to make 
an absolute statement about 
anything in the world, yet the 
author is interpreting Romans 
13:2 as such a statement; that 
because of one verse, every 
ruler in history is good, and 
has grace in the eyes of the 
Lord. 

Any theologian wiD tell you 
that this just isn't so. For 
instance, Proverb. 29: 12 

~ates, " If a ruler harkens to 
lies, all his serv ants are 

wicked." If each verse in the 
Bible is looked at individually, 
in a black·or·white manner, 
many contradictions can be 
found. But this is not how it is 
IUpposed to be viewed. You 
cannot look at one sentence 
and underetand the measage 
of the entire story. Eltewhere 
in the Bible, statements are 
made to the effect that if a 

government is not good, and 
does not follow God's ways, 
then it is indeed not a good 
government. 

Romans 13:2 has a more 
literal meaning, which can be 
expressed in this example: If 
this country was under a 
serious physical attack, and 
the people did not stand with

At. far as we know, "Night

Bill to Save Gov't 
Works in Congress 

WASHINGTON -
House and Senate negotiators 
rushed to finish work by 
midnight yesterday on an 
emergency-spending bill 
needed to avert a shutdown of 
nearly the entire federal 
government, except· activities 
to protect "life and pmperty.·' 

By mid-day, the negotiators 
had plowed through less than 
half of the 48 differences 
between the House and Senate 
versions of the bill. The 
legislation would finance the 
government between the 
midnight deadline, and the end 
01 fiscal year 1980, and Dec. 
15. 

Although disagreements 
remain on some sensitive 
issues, Sen. Warren 
Magnuson. D.Wash. , 
Appropriations Committee 
chairman, expressed confi· 
dence that a compromise 
would be reached in time to 
prevent the threatened 
shutdown. 

House Speaker Thomas P. 
O'Neill Jr. said the House 
would remain in session as late 
as necl::ssary to act on a 
conference report once one is 
approved the the negotiators. 

From the 
U1iversity 
Events 
Office: 

" With the government 
going out of business , the 
answer is yes ... we'li stay here 
until such time as the 
c ontinuing resolution is 
completed," O 'Neill told a 
news conference . 

Final Senate approval also 
is nef'ded, as is the signature of 
President Carter, before the 
stopgap spending bill can take 
effect. 

By early yesterday 
ahernoon, the conference still 
faced differences over the level 
of funding for many 
government programs, public 
financing for abortion and low· 
income energy assistance. 

And while Cogress tried to 
resolve those sticking points, 
federal officials continued 
preparations for the 
unprecedented step of closing 
down the government except 
for essential services. 

The need for a continuing 
resolution to fund the 
government and pay its 5 
million employees resulted 
because none of the 13 regular 
appropriations bills had been 
enacted into law as fiscal 1980 
drew to a close at midnight 
yesterday.

In Khuzestan, Iraqi troops 
were locked in battle with 
Iranian defenders six miles 
south of the provincial capital 
of Ahwaz, AP correspondent

Seventy miles south of

No Searches 
of Newsrooms 

WASHINGTON - The 
House is expected to complete 
congressional action soon on 
Senate-approved legislation to 
restrict the use of surprise 
searches of newsrooms by law 
enforcement agencies. 

The legislation, put into 
final form by a House-Senate 
conference committee, was 
approved by voice vote in the 
Senate on Monday. 

It is designed to overcome 
the effects of a 1978 Supreme 
Court decision upholding a 
search of the offices of a 
Stanford University student 
newspaper by police armed 
with a search warrant. 

The bill would require all 
federal . state and local law 
enforcement officers to obtain 
a subpoena "which can be 
challenged in courl" when 
seeking evidence from writers, 
editors. scholars and others

I'Ol a Rock Critic! 
And You Can Be One, Too 

BY MARCIA BRISBOIS 
Sc>ecial to the Daily Guardian 

I've decided that I want to 
be a rock critic. Everyone 
thinks I'm kidding, but I'm not. 
In preparation for the job, I've 
been reading Rolling Stone for 
about a year now , and feel ' 
confident that I can match' 
critical skills with the best of 
them. 

I have one particularly 
representative savant in mind 
- Dave Marsh. He really 
impresses me because he's 
parlayed what seems to be a 
few basic skills and 
observations into mega.bucks 
- a biography of Bruce 
Springsteen , The Rolling 
Stone Record Guide, and, of 
course, a place in the Stone 's 
staff box. 

But anything Dave can do, I 
can do, too. After all, I started 
listening to rock and roll at an 
early enough age to have a 
musical heritage and a 
personal history of rock that I 
want to share with everyone. 

It'll be able to show off this 
historical perspective with 
obscure references to esoteric 
groups who recorded a single 
but brilliantly conceived and 
engineered 45 - that seldom 
reproduced manic wha wha 
that they got by recording the 
take in their bomb shelter. 

Myrick a 
No Show 
at Pub 

Gary Myrick and the 
Figures did not show up for 
their free concert Sunday night 
at the Pub, 

The new wave rockers 
claimed that their bass player 
was ill enough to preclude 
making the trip from Los 
Angeles to San Diego. 

A. university events 
sJX>kesman said that he had 
cifficulty with the band last 
Friday night over what 
speakers would be used for the 
show, but that the band's 
manager assured him they 
would play anyway. 

Myrick and the Figures 
played an energetic and well 
received show Friday and 
Saturday night in Los 
Allleles, according to a Los 
Anteles Times report. 

Times reviewer Robert 
Hilburn noted in the review the 
spirited and playful play of that 
MIne baSIl player. 

Myrick'. manager was 
unavailable for comment. 

Myrick and the Figures 
played on campus the last day 
of aprina quarter this year, 
openinJ for Southside Johnny 
and the Aabury Jukes. Since 
then, the group has produced 
their own album, named after 
the band, and played dates up 
and down the West Coast. 

No makeup date for the 
concert hal been set. 

I'll use this ability especially 
when, in mid·review, I stop to 
trace the reviewee 's rock roots 
- surprisingly similar to my 
own - being careful to 
remember all the groups Eric 
Clapton and Mick Taylor were 
in before they went solo. 

Maybe now you 'r e 
beginning to believe me. But 
the above is just a small part of 
my qualifications. For one 
thing ,. I have the review forms 
down fairly pat. 

I can do the "great group 
resting on its laurels but 
growing extremely estranged 
from its audience and 
increasingly paranoid, 

hu~orless and wealthy" 
review. 

Others at hand are the, 
"Hey I've been a fan of this 
group for ages and this new 
album may be poorly con· 
ceived, but you guys are still 
the greatest around and al · 
ways will be - what does the 
crass public know," and, 
"Sure they wear new wave 
clothes and have material by 
new writers but the pace is the 
same on every album they've 
ever done and it's an artistic 
but valiant failure." 

Finally, there is the, "Oh 
God, it's the most brilliant) 

vital album I've heard since so· 
and·so, and if you readers love 
rock and roll you'll rush out 
and buy it." 

Sure, there are more, but I 
think I can get by on these in 
various combinations until I 
learn some of the more subtle 
ropes of the business . 

Another area I feel fairly 
confident about is my use of 
similes. Every 1l00d critic, rock 
or otherwise has a command 
of dynamic analogies to use 
when describing something 
she or he really likes or hates. 

In rock, the macho motor 
image still ranks high, so here 
are a few beauts, if I do say so 

October I, 1980 

myself: "The guitar break is 
~ke a brand new Bill Blass 
Mark IV Continental hurtling 
throullh a showroom 
wi~dow." Or, "The sax 
sounds like a greyhound brak· 
inglor an .unwary pedestrian." 

Those are kind, but I'll be 
cruel, too: " The rhythm 
section sounds like an 18· 
wheeler with four flat tires ." 

My favorite part of the job 
will be thinking up metaphor. 
for the artists themselves. To 
prepare for this task, I've 
stayed awake at night listening 
to .ome of my a11·time least· 
favorite groups and have 
come up with a few . 

I'm going to call the EaaIes 
and Joan Didions of rock. And 
Neil Diamond will be the John 
Phillip Sousa of pop vocalista. 
Little Nicolette Larson will be 
our generation's Shirl_ey 
Temple. "Dance for me, Mr 
Bojangles," she'I quaver to 
Jerry Jeff Walker. 

But before I leave you with 
the impression that it all came 
easily, I should mention a 
couple of things that really had 
me hung up. I had trouble 
embracing the sexual double 
standard that exists in rock 
criticism. 

First, I dislike dismissing

Ken Cinema Plans 
Three Festivals 

Bond, Hitchcock, 'the Worst' 
BY RICK GREENE 

Stoff Wriler 
For most moviegoers 'the fall season is the slowest, most 

dreadful cinema time of all. All the big studios either are saving 
their blockbusters for Christmas or already released them the 
past summer. As a result, the film·going public is "treated" to 
such indigestable gems as Zombie and Without Warning. 

01 course, there are exceptions to this rule. Take, for 
instance, the excellent Stunt Man and Woody Allen (who 
never releases his films during the 'prime' seasons, and wisely 
50). 

But the cure for the silver screen blahs <:Hn be found in any 
number of San Die,Bo cinema r~pertory theaters. One of the 
best is the Ken Cinema at 4061 Adams Ave. in Kensington. 
Most of these second·run, third·run, and re·run theater-s have 
something interesting to offer, but the Ken is the most versatile 
of them all . 

The Ken has been open since 1942. The original owner of 
the building, now 86 years old, still works several days a week 
as a projectionist. Manager Eleanor Durham says, "The Ken 
program is based on showing the greatest variety of films," and 
indeed the schedule reflects just that. You'll find on the current 
Ken listing every thing_ Jrom old American classics (n.e 
African QUeen, Gone With The Wind, Casablanca) and cult 
fibns 200 Mo.el., Pink flamingos) to Chaplin (The GreG. 
Dictator, The Gold Rush), James Dean (East of Eden, Rebel 
Without a Cowe) and Kung·Fu (Enter The Dragon, The Street 
Figltter). 

"The turnover- of ~grams is so great that in Ie .. than tluee 
months over 120 different films will play. 1bi. is because the 
Ken recently switched from three to six different programs per 
week. There i, an audience for each program. 

Movie buffs will invariably attend reshowings of the 
Hollywood film c1asaics swring Boiart, Attaire and Garbo 
ones they have seen counties. times. The same holds true for 
foreign film freaks , blood.and' &!-Its buffs, animation 
afficianadol and rock·film lover.. There is something for

Labor Troubles in the Arts World 
NY Met Opera Season Cancelled; TV Shoots Monday 

NEW YORK - For the first time 
this century, the nation's premiere 
opera company apparently will be off 
atqe and oft radio for a season. 
Holdinl firm alainst musicians' 
inIiatence on a Ihorter week, directors 
of the Metropolitan (}pera called off the 
1980·81 IeaIon rather than face a 
h deficit. 1\: decision by the Met's executive 
c:ornmittee Monday appeared to shut 
the door on a year's work for 1,962 full-
time and part.time employees. Met 
Executive Director Anthony Blill said 
it WM impouible to predict whether the 
deciaion was irrevocable or could 
chante if the union cUpute were settled. 

There would be real problems 
pu&n, the opera conpmy together 
now, he 1IIid. After Thursday, .tar 
performers are no looter held to their 
contracts. 

"11Iere ia no way we could accept the 
orchestra'. demand_ .. and expect the 
Met to aurvive," .aid Met Preaident 

Frank E. T ap~n. "Anybody in the world 
who cares about opera will be talking 
about this," diva Renata Scotto said 
Monday. "I am very sad .. .1 really think 
about the people who have been put out 
of work." 

Cancellation of the 98th season and 
next spring's eight-week national tour 
came after months of negotiation with 
the American Federation of Musicians, 
Local 802 and rejection of a final offer 
by the union Sunday night. 

Some people were crying at the 
bargaining table "with the re~zation 
that there might not be a season," said 
Wayne L. Horvitz, the federal mediator 
who had been overseeing negotiation •. 
Taplin .aid the union will not listen to an 
offer that does not include a four-
performance week . To cut one 
performance a week from each 
mu.ician's .chedule would mean 
paying orchestra members 
approximately $40,000 per year for 
some 21 hoUR of work per week. 

LOS ANGELES - Actor and 
producers are getting closer to a 
aettlement of the 10-week actors strike 
and some television shows - those not 
targeted by .triking musicians - could 
be back in production as early as 
Monday. 

Producers have not reached a 
deci.ion on when to return to work. But 
work could begin on such shows as 
Archie Bunker's Place and WKRP in 
Cincinnati, NBC's Sanford and 
Different Strokes, and ABC', Barney 
Miller. 

The American Federation of 
Musicians walked out soon after the 
actors did and negotiations are to 
resume today. Their strike is only 
again.t filmed programs, and taped 
shows are not Ilffected. 

"We don't know yet which shows will 
go back into production," said ArTRA 
spokesman Dick Moore. "They have to 
dear it with the union and they have to 
be shows the musicians are not 

striking." 
At iaaue in the musicians strike is the 

union's demand for residuals for retums 
of filmed television shows. The previous 
contracts for the musicians, who play 
film scores, have not provided for 
residuals. 

The western boards of the Screen 
Actors Guild and the American 
Federation of Television and Radio 
Artists approved the tentative 
agreement for a new three-year actors 
contract Saturday, and on Monday the 
eaatern boards foUowed suit. 

AFTRA recommended ratification 
by 18-5, SAG by 29-3, and they 
concurred in the western boards' 
decision not to send people back to 
work pending ratification said SAG 
spokeswoman Kim Fellner. The 
AFTRA vote on that was 19-2 and the 
SAG vote on that was 32-zip. The 
central board of AFTRA will vole in 
Chicago Oct. 14, but voting among -
SAG board members is now completed.

The Chaplin 
SyndroDle 

BY RICK GREENE 
Marty Feldman, like his 

mentors Mel Brooks and Gene 
Wilder, is a sick man suffering 
from a disease which strikes 
only successful film 
comedians. This rare disease, 
discovered over 60 years ago, 
has been dubbed 'The Chaplin 
Syndrome.' Unfortunate 
comedians thus afflicted begin 
to believe that they can write, 
direct and star in their own 
motion pictures. There is no 
known cure. 

The latest product of this 
delusion is Marty Feldman's In 
God We Trust . Released by 
Universal last week, the film 
(subtitled, Gimme That Prime 
Time Religion) tries hard to be 
funny and make an important 
statement, but only half-
succeeds on both counts. It is 
the story of a harmless monk 
named Ambrose (Feldman) 
and his efforts to raise money 
in 'the real world' in order to 
save his monastery from 
financial c ollapse -
something like last summer's 
Blues Brothers plot. 

Feldman displays the full 
range of 'Chaplin Syndrome' 
symptoms. Not that there is 
anything very wrong with this 
film, but nothing is very right 
with it either . Feldman's 
direction is competent enough 
- as far as monk comedies go 

- and his writing (with Chris 
Allen) is coherent, structured 
and sometimes amusing, but 
Marty is not the leading man 
type. 

Feldman supported Gene 
Wilder in Mel Brook's Young 
Frankenstein (before any of 
them caught 'The Chaplin 

,Syndrome') as the hunchback 
Eye-gor and effortlessly stole 
the film . In this type of 'second 
banana' role he can be 
marvelous, but when Feldman 
plays the lead character it just 
doesn't work. He is funny , but 
he lacks appeal, charisma and 
sympathy in sufficient 
measure to carry a film. 

As Brother Ambrose, 
Feldman journeys to the big 
city (Los Angeles) to raise the 
necessary capital, and meets a 
prostitute with a heart of gold 
(Louise Lasser), whom he 
later romances. He also 
encounters a religious tramp 
charlatan (Peter Royle) who 
drives a church bus and sells 
anything in his best never-
give-a-sucker -an-even-break 
manner. Some of these scenes 
were filmed in San Diego near 
the downtown rescue mission 
and several massage parlors. 
Apparently LA waan't seamy 
enough. 

The Daily Guardian 

Appropriately, a 'second 
banana' manages to steal this 
film right from under Marty's 
frock. Andy Kaufman plays 
Annegeddon T. Thunderbird, 
an outrageous characteriza-
tion of an obnoxious television 
evangelist. Thunderbird 's 
private God is a money-
hungry computer (with 
Richard Pryor inside) which 
soon exploits Ambrose until 
the good Brother reads the 
Bible into its memory banks. 

There are a fair share of 
well-executed pratfalls and 
nice sight ~ags, but much of it 
just doesn t work - like the 
dull skateboard-chase climax, 
or the scene where Louise 
Lasser tries to explain the joys 
of sex by using the names 01 
foods to substitute for dirty 
words. This sounds funny , but 
all the wrong words are used, 
so the effect is only one of 
silliness. The film is , finally , 
merely an interesting half-
failure and a textbook 
example of one man trying to 
do too much in the creation of 
a motion picture. 

In God We Trust is playing 
at the Fashion Valley 4 
Theaters.

But while student leaders 
strongly oppose the proposal , 
Armitage said that a "growing 
consensus" - consisting 
primarily of administrators -
has shown support for parts or 
the whole of the proposal. 

And because many 
students, faculty and staff 
have expressed interest in 
discussing the proposal, 
Armitage said, "I'm not being 
honest if I go ahead with the 
current system." 

Armitage said he will make 
a final decision on the proposal 

within two to th ree weeks so 
that the committee can 
convene. 

However, if Armitage 
chooses to reject the student

Metzger assailed Affirma-
tive Action programs in public 
schools and universities as 
"counterproductive, " 

"They don't really end up 
correcting inadequacies. They 
end up causing hostilities and 
violence because when there

"I have literally hundreds of

jobs through Affirmative

He went on to attack 
bilingual education in schools, 
saying that such programs are 
"only duplicating energies."

because one supports 
grassroots politics and is left of 
the' liberal party doesn't 
necessarily make one a 
vegetarian_ During the first 
week of my internship I was 
afraid to eat my lunch -
which consisted of a meat 
sandwich 99 percent of the 
time - in front 01 my fellow 
workers , However, this fear 
dimini,hed when I discovered 
my editor was spending his 
lunch hour under the golden 
arches. 

When you get down 10 it 
wasn't it a waste of time!' Alter 
all, if I'm really interested in a 
career in journalism, that kind 
of writing experience isn't 
going to get me anywhere. Not 
true. If anything, I've become 
more critical of what I see and 
hear_ And a good journalist 
should not take things for 
granted. 

Another thing: This was no-
file-this-for·me or can-you·get-
me-a-cup-of-coffee internship, 
I was treated like a real-life 
reporter. I guess what this all 
gets down to is this: What 
Newsline had to oller was just 
different, and I'm always up 
for something new ,

would probably lose to the 
attackers, and we would lose 
our treasured freedoms , In 
effect, we would be damned. 

As to the implication that 
the presidential candidates are 
not any good because they 
believe in the Bible, every 
president that this country has 
ever had has believed in God. 
Sure we have had some bad 
ones, but we have also had 
some very good ones , 
Because of this, our country 
has the oldest existing 
government in the world 
today, and with God 's help, 
this country will be around 
and we will ha ve the freedom 
to express our views for a long 
time to come_
