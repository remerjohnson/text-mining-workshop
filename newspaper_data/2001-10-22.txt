UCSD hosted ;1 campllswidc open 
house aturday to mark the end of its 40th 
annivcr ary and celebrate homecoming for 
alumni. 

An esomated 15,000 people attended 
the event, which ran from 9 a.m. until 4 
p.m. and offered an array of free fanll ly 
activities, tours, educational demonstra-
tions, entertainment, vendors and sporting 
events. 

The purpose of the event was "to high-
light and showcase to the community and 
the many programs going on at UCSD," 
said Judy Lane of Special Even ts and 
Protocol, a co-chair of the event. 

Lane, along with co-chairs Mark 
Cunningham of Housing and Dining 
Services and Yolanda Leyva of Student 
Affairs, have been planning the UCSD 
Open House, the first in II years, since 
May with the assistance of a 65 -member 
UCSD staff committee and hundreds of 
volunteers. 

Open House was designed to present 
fun, as well as educational aspects of 
UCSD. 

"We wanted it to be a fun day to show 
UCSD's diversity," CLUmingham said. 

The day began wi th campus tours for 
prospective students and seminars about 
housi ng, financia l aid and admissions. 

After touring the campus and attending 

seminars, high school student Jamie 
\ Vcndell said he enjo)'ed the chance to see 
the campus and learn more about the Ulll -
versity. 

"It was rcally cool. [The campus] is real-
ly pretty and we like that," \ Vendcl l said. 

Faculty members gave talks on subjects 
ranging from music to Ilolitics. 
Communication professor Daniel Ibllin 
spoke on "Patriotism and Professionalism: 
The Media ~nd War." Ethnic tudies pro-
fessor George Lipsitz presented a talk on 
thc effects of migration, globalization and 
discrimination in the United tates. 

The cripps lnstitution of 
Oceanography offered a series of family 
activities and entertainment as well. Scripps 
scientists conducted an instructional surf 
clinic and explained the science of surfing. 
VISitors learned the an of fish painting and 
watched Irish dancers and a nautical musi -
cal group. 

Open House fea ured an "Oktoberfest" 
beer gnrden sponsored by Karl Strauss with 
German food and polka dancers. Musical 
acts such as San Diego's own Mar De1s and 
award-winning Agent 22 performed at the 
evenc. 

A range Elf entertainment &0111 both 
UCSD students and community groups 
was offered throughout th'e day. 

The Price Center served as "a showcase 
for student organizations and UCSD stu-
dents with incredible talent," said student

Wednesday at their meeting in Sun 
Francisco.

Union: UC hospitals 
not prepared for crisis 
H ospitals deny claim, angered by 
what they call bargaining tactics

UCSD Medical Centers in La 
Jolla and Ililicrest are among hos-
pitals dl3t the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees union is warning may 
be ill-prepared to handle the intlux 
of patients that would follow a ter-
rorist arrack. 

UPTE represents 330 employ-
ees at the two UCS D hospi tals and 
2, I 00 at UC hospitals statewide. 
They say low wages and long hours 
lie at the root of the staffi ng prob-
lem. 

Representatives of UCSD med-
ical centers fiercely deny the union 
members' contention, saying they 
are taking advantage of public anxi-
ety over terrorism to gain leverage 
at the bargaining table. 

"I think it is unconscionable that 
any labor union would use scare 
tactics to achieve their aims at a 
time like this," said Dr. Jake Jacoby, 
commander of the UCSD Medical 
Centcr Disaster Medical Assistance 
Team. 

Members of the union said the 
ept. II attacks were first men-

tioned by UC negotiators during a 
negotiation session and not 
brought up by them. 

"We are nor trying to use the 
current climate to scare people," 
sa id UPTE organizer Tcrry 
Bunting. "The university is using it 
to shut down negotiaoons and sup-
press negotiations." 

Bunting said that during their 
last negotiation session, the union 
was encouraged to accept a final 
offer of I to 2 percent merit raises 
because of a looming recession and 
war. 

Both sides ha ve subsequently set 
a date to meet again. 

"We were so aghast that they 
would bring it up and not take the 
problem more seriously," said 
UPTE Local 91\9 President 
Jeliger Kalmijn. 

The problem in a medical crisis, 
according to the union, is that (''U1'-
rent low staffing levels would exac-
erbate a medical crisis if a situation 
similar to that of Sept. 11 arises. 
Jacoby said the medical centers are 
well prepared to deal with a crisis 
by following their disaster plan. 

Workers are leavin9 UC hospi-
tals for better paying jobs else-
where, and litde is being done to 
hire qualified replacements and 
retain current employees, said 
UPTE member Wendy Mullen, Jl

T he annual Chancellor's 
Challenge 5 krn RunlWal k was held 
Friday at RlMAC Field, attracting 
almost 900 participants and generat-

scholarship funds . 

Students, facu lty, staff, members 
of affiliated organizations and area 
residents attended. All had the intent 
of rW1l1ing the 3.1 mile course faster 
than Chancellor Robcn C. Dynes, 
who personally donated $25 for 
every runner who finished before 
him. Dynes, who typically jogs five 
days a week, placed 155th while 
posting a time of 22 minutes, 9 sec-

"This event is designed for two 
reasons: to raise money for under-

that Jl1y Single hospital would be

a ter plans take advantage of other

prove horrible in a situation if bioter-

to Mullen. 

"Ira disaster strikes and people want 
to be tested, If our lab IS munda ted with 
tests, there will be delays and an 
increase in error," Mullen said. 

Jacoby noted the already high vol-
ume of lab work processed to show that 
Ihe labs are capable. 

"Every day the hospitals process 
hundreds. if not thousands of micro-
organlSlns and lab tests without having 
a problem." Jacoby said.

Regents appoint student.-regent designate 
T he UC Board of Regents officially appoint-

ed UC Berkeley junIOr Dexter G. Ligot-Gordon 
as srudent-regent designate at their meeting O ct. 
17. 

T he 21-year-old from Vallejo, Ca li f. is major-
ing in politica l economy of II1dustrial societies at 
UC Berkeley. 

As th e stud ent - regent designate, Ligot-
Gordon is able to participate in deliberations 
but cannot vote. I lis term as student regent 
begi ns in july 2002 . fie then becomes a voting 
member. 

Ligot-Gordon is the first Filipino-American 
srudent-regent designate to serve on the Board 
of Regents. 

I.igul -Gordon ~aid he finds it ironic that, in 
light of his high-visibility pos ition, he had to use 
the appeals process to gain admission to UC 
Berkeley. 

He is the 28th srudent regent since the posi-
tion was established in 1975. Tracy M. Davis, a 
graduate srudent at UCLA, is the current voting 
srudent regent. 

Molecular motor ~acks DNA 
into viruses at high pressures 

The DNA inside some viruses has an internal 
pressure of 10 times that of the pressure inside a 
champagne bottle, according to biophysicists at 
UCSD, UC Berkeley and the University of 
Minnesota . 

Researchers suspect that the high pressures 
help the vi rus transfer its DNA into human cells. 
Once the DNA is inside, it begins retooling the 
ce ll to make more viruses. 

The tight paclcing inside the virus is achieved 
by powerful molecular motors . 

The motor srudied by the researchers is part 
of the bacteriophage phi-29, a virus that is the 
scourge of the common soil bacterium Bacillus 
, uhu lt ,

UCSD Regional Burn Center 
releases 2000 statistics 

The UCSD Regional Burn Center released 
its annua l statistics report, li sting numbers and 
rypes of burns suffered by people in San Diego 

and Imperial counties. 
Some 440 patients were admitted to the cen-

ter in 2000 for injuries and smoke inhalation. 
This represents a 5 percent increase in burn 
patients from 1999, but the lowest mortality 
rate since 1996. In 2000, there were eight 
deaths . 

People age 18 to 65 consti ruted 285 admis-
sions. Twenry of those admitted were over age 
65 . lnfants up to age three constiruted 75 admis-
sions and children from four to 12 made up 33 
admissions. Teen-agers age 12 to 18 were 27 of 
tile patients admitted. 

Most accidents in all groups were home 
accidents . For the youngest two age groups, 
cooking and scalding accidents were the most 
common. Contact with objects such as curling 
irons, clothing irons, hot coals, fireworks, 
gasoline, gunpowder and barbecues were also 
common causes of accidents involving young 
children .. 

Males were 72.5 percent of those admitted to 
the burn center. 

Huntington's Disease Clinic 
designated Center of Excellence 

T he UCSD H untington 'S Disl'ase C linic 
was recognized by the H untingtoh's Disease 
Society of America as a Center of Excellence. 
T he clinic was one of the first centers in the 
western United States to receive this recogni-
tion. 

The brain disorder primarily strikes men 
and women age 30 to 45 . It causes involuntary 
movements, severe emotional disturbance and 
cognitive decline. Affected individuals often 
die from complications such as choking, infec -
tion or heart failure . 

Huntington's disease has been diagnosed in 
30,000 Americans, with 150,000 at risk . Family 
members havc 3 50 percent chance of inheriting 
the disorder from an affected parent. 

Approximately 278 individuals in San Diego 
have been diagnosed with the disorder and 1,52 1 
are at risk. The UCSD center has seen a signifi-
cant number of these patients. 

There is currently no treatment for the dis-
ease. The UCSD clinic provides medication for 
the movement disorder and antidepressants for 
the cognitive problems. 

Members of the UCSD program focus on 
conducting research to.find new treatments for 
Huntington's disease.

Tentatively, D odge completed the 
course in 18:57 while wearing a num-
ber belonging to sraffperson Linda 
Williams. Dodge denies the cheating 
accusations. 

Pete Chenard of San Diego placed 
first in the race, running the 5 kilo-
meter course in 15:43 . The fastest 
female competi tor was D enise 
Chenard, who finished in 19: I 7 and 
placed 36th overall. 

Francis Heileman Dynes, wife of 
the chancellor, makes a similar wager 
to her husband's, donating $25 for 
every female. An ankle injury kept her 
out of the race this year, but last year's 
time was used as this year's qualifying

---R~ation 
Last weekend's APEC conference in Shang~ai, China gave leaders an oppor-
tunity to air concerns over the global economy and to discuss reforms 
By CATHERINE NAVARRO 
Contributing Writer 

Last weekend, the heads of state of the 21 
member nations of the Asian-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation met in Shanghai, 
China to begin their annual summit. 

The significance of the summit in cur-
rent times cannot be overlooked by world 
leaders. Now more than ever, there is a 
need for the United States to demonstrate 
its solidarity with its Asian trading partners 
for the sake of the world economy, and for 
it to work on broad coalition-building with 
those nations, particularly its Asian Muslim 
allies . 

Its economic substance aside, the summit 
was also an essential political forum for 
PreSident George W. Bush, whose excellent 
statesmanship will have its day during the 
meetings. 

Significa ntl y, it was on Friday during 
APEC proceedings that Bush met Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin. The importance of a 
productive relationship between the twO 
leaders ca nnot be overemphasized, and all 
signs seem to point to the cultivation -of a 
fruitful working relationship between Jiang 
and Bush. 

Bush has also had the opportunity to meet 
again with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
The summit no doubl exposed him to an 

assortment of leaders with whom robust and 
industrious contact is vital. 

It is difficult for anything occurring on 
the world stage after Sept. II not to be cast 
in the monolithic shadow of the events of 
that date. 

However, APEC representatives are 
doing their best to enact a return to normal-
cy while still giving a nod to the need for sol-
idarity among member nations. 

Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan 
has made explicit his desire that the APEC 
summit not be just another airing ground for 
the United States' war on terrorism. 

The subject has certainly received dia-
logue, however, and U .S. Secretary of State 
Colin Powell was pleased to report that there 
was broad support among APEC member 
nations for a "fight between justice and evil," 
though without specific references to the 
U.S .-British bombing campaign in 
Afghaoistan. . 

This support does not tome without 
some trepidation . One opportunity that the 
U .S. delegation has been quick to take 
advantage of has been reassuring Muslim 
members of APEC that the retaliatory cam-
paign in the Middle East is in no way a 
strike against Islam. 

APEC members in Indonesia and 
Malaysia, in particular have expressed con-
cerns about the backlash that the attacks on 

Afghanistan will produce in the . Muslim 
world. 

Member nations such as Indonesia and 
the Philippines, however, can also provide 
support and understanding to the United 
States, having wrestled with domestic terror-
ism themselves. 

The main importance of the summit 
comes, of course, in its opportunity to enact 
a return to normalcy for shaken national 
economies. 

It is difficult to pretend at this point that 
the U.S. economy is not poised on the brink 
of a recession of some sort, particularly now 
that the United States is at war. The U .S. 
economic slowdown naturally carries with it 
the potential to send ripples throughout the 
world. 

The mid-1990s saw a recession in Asia 
that threatened to pull at world economic 
stability. Now more than ever, it is important 
that the United States strengthen its eco-
nomic links with its Asian trade partners, 
links which are undeniably vital to the well -
being of the U.S. economy. 

U .S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan reassured the Joint Economic 
Committee of Congress last week that 
though the economy is currently jittery, the 
long-term potential for growth and stability 
still remains. 

APEC members have shown their faith 

in such a statement in the course of their 
encounters with one another so far. 
Attitude in that realm has the potential to 
make or break economies. 

By focusing on the long term, as APEC 
has striven to do, members of the coopera-
tive set an example on the world stage that 
helps to allay economic tremors. 

The economy may well be the best 
means of enacting a return to normalcy 
post-Sept. 11. While some industries still 
demonstrate indecision and a mentality 
mired in apprehension - as illustrated by 
the trepidation of the Emmy organizers to 
settle on a date for their awards show - the 
financial world has worked to conduct busi-
ness as usual. 

The governing commitree of the 
International Monetary Fund will meet in 
less than a month after having originally 
postponed its meeting. 

The G20, comprised of members of the 
G8 and key financial ministers from emerg-
ing markets and world banks, will likewise 
meet. 

Our economic future is never certain, 
and is even less so in the tumult of the often 
capricious Asian economy. However, the 
APEC summit is another road sign whose 
indicators demonstrate that where there is 
cooperation, there is progress and security 
in store.

Courage emerges among students 
Washington interns face terror on a daily basis 

I' \IZI~:\ 11:111 \1-1. \ , 

College students from across the 
nation are interning in 
Washington, D.C. on 
the frontlines of terror. 

The interns who work on 
Capitol Hill do so at an extremely 
high risk, because it is the respon-
sibility of most interns to open the 
bulk of mail that enters a House or 
Senate office. Because of thi s daily 
responsibility, four of my friends 
had to be tested fo r anthrax expo-
sure. 

One friend interns on the samc 
floor of the H art building where 
Sen. :rom Daschle's office is locat-
ed . After the first news last 
.Monday of the anthrax letter in 
Daschle's office, my &iend waited 
and wondered why his senator's 
o ffice remained open while 
Daschle's office was quarantined. 

Staff from the Senate offices 
are in contact throughout the d~y 
on a regular basis, talian. and 
passi ng on letters and papers 
between the two offices. 

o my &iend waited, wondered 
and worried - as did many of his 
fellow interns who work in that, 
office or neighboring offices. 

And after the House closed for 
business last Wednesday and all 
House interns and staff - includ-
ing three of my friends - were sent 
home, my friend was left to wonder 
about his own fine. My friend ques-
tioned the motives of Daschle: 
Why was he keeping the Senate 
offices open, trying to continue 
business as usual, when things were 
far from normal , and productivity 
was close to nothing? 

Wednesday afternoon, twO 
days after the contaminated letter 
was found, my friend in the 
Senate was told that he could 
informally leave, not officially, 
since the Senate was still supposed 
to be conducting business as usual. 

Then he was told that he need-
ed to be tested for anthrax expo-· 
sure. As of Friday, my friend con-
tinues to wait for the results . 
Meanwhile, as a precaution, he is 
taking Cipro, the antibiotic used 
to treat those with possible 
anthrax exposure. 

We have been 
exposed to danger 

and threat of death on 
the largest scale for 
the first time in our 

lives, but our legs did 
not buckle. We did not 

cave in to the paniC 
and fear we have all 

felt at some particular 
time. 

My other three friends who 
intern at the House have also been 
tested for anthrax exposure. They 
toO are waiting for the results. 

However, this new terrorist 
threat of anthrax not only puts 
political interns on the Hill at 
extreme risk, but media interns as 
well. . 

I have a friend who interns at 
CNN with "Larry King Live." One 
of her first tasks of the day is to 
open, read and respond to all mail 
that is addressed to King. She could 
very well have opened an anthrax-
contaminated letter if one was sent 
to King. 

As a result, a task that was once 
routine is now something she not 
only tries putting off. but some-

thing she now fears . She has also 
been tested for anthrax exposure 
and IS waiting for the results. In 
the interim, she is taking Cipro. 

All of the college students who 
made the decision to intern in 
Washington never signed up for 
being terrorized with the threat of 
anthrax, but like the rest of the 
nation, we had no choice and no 
warning. 

We have been exposed to dan-
ger and threat of death on the 
largest scale for the first time in 
our lives, but our legs did not 
buckle. We did not cave in to the 
panic and fear we all felt at some 
particular time. 

Many of our parents' genera-
tion accuse our generation of 
being too apathetic, lazy and hav-
ing no respect for authority. 

Well , I have just one thing to 
say to our critics: Look at us now. 
Look at the thousands of interns 
who continue to go about their 
lives in a city where uncertainty 
and fear are our constant compan-
ions. 

We are not backing down in 
the face of the gravest terror of 
our lives, and I believe that it is an 
act of bravery JUSt by staying in 
D .C., on the &ontlines of terror. 

If our critics took the time to 
talk to us, they would find that in 
the aftermath of the Sept. II 
attacks, many of our families 
pleaded with us to come home. 
And now with this newest terrorist 
threat of anthrax, every one of my 
intern &iends has had to fend off 
our families' orders to come home 
to safety. 

But not one of us that I know 
of is leaving. The terrorists' acts 
and the ensuing tragedy and panic 
have brought our college genera-
tion together into an awesome, 
cohesive and spirited unit. I know 
I am speaking for many interns 
here in D .C. when I say that no 
act of terror will scare us away. 

Hell no, we won't go!

OPINION 5 

Out with the old 
rules, in with the new 
Strict general education require-
ments desperately need revisions 
By MAnHEW LEPORI 
Contributing Writer 

Why is there a need for so much 
"general education"? 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
requires its undergraduates to take 
19 general education courses, or 76 
units. You know what that means 
for the student? Nineteen courses 
of subjects that we could not care 
less about. 

I have heard the arguments for 
having a comprehensive GE course 
setup. It gives students a broad edu-
cation. It makes sure they have 
some understanding in a variety of 
areas. After taking the G E course 
lineup, students will not have defi-
ciencies in certain fields of their 
education. 

Like communism, this theory 
works better on paper than in prac-
tice. Just because students are 
required to take certain courses 
does not mean students will attend 
the lectures or attempt to learn the 
information. 

People say that GE classes such 
as Making of the Modern World , 
the ERC humanities course, result 
in well -rounded students. Well, 
how well-rounded are these stu-
dents when they learn so little in 
these classes? 

Students learn what they want 
to learn - nothing more. They 
will do what is necessary to garner 
themselves a decent grade. The 
grade is what is important in these 
classes, not the material. 

After going through two years 
of MMW, I can safely say that the 
majority of students there did not 
want to be taking the coursc. Many 
students regularly skipped 
classes. Many did not study or do 
the reading at all, relying instead on 
cram sessions before midterms and 
finals . 

The result of this? These stu-
dents were not truly learning any-
thing. They actually retained very 
little information. 

Now, I am certainly not calling 
for attendance rolls or weekly 
tests on the material to ensure 
that students are studying. Doing 
so would only antagonize students 
further. 

College should be about learn-
ing the subject or subjects that 
interest you most. It shou ld not be

about learn ing mate rial that some 
commi ttee of administrators 
thinks is good fo r you. FOrcing 
students to study in areas other 
than what they ~ re inte rested in 
often results in disinterest and diS-
satisfaction among the student 
body. 

I did not come to thi s school to 
study sciences, math or non-
\,vestern fine arts . T do not have any 
great desire to learn about these 
subjects. 

Many students have Similar atti -
tudes. Want proof? Look at how 
many students would like to trans-
ter to Muir College. the one wllh 
the fewest GE requirements. 

What is there to do aboul 
these classes? Simply tone them 
down. If GE courses mU>l be m 
place, require twO courses In 
math or science, two in literature 
and two in fine arts or language. 
Students can then get thesc 
courses out of the way quickl), 
and focus on the material that 
actually interests them . Your 
computer science and engineer-
ing friend could actually graduJtc 
in four yea rs with you. 

By not havi ng to take twO years 
of garbage, I would not have had 
to take courses such as astronomy 
or oceanography, which have little 
value toward my writing 
skills. Does knowing how many 
moons Jupiter has makes me a 
better writer? No. D oes knowmg 
how the coastal currents near 
California work make me a better 
person? No. 

Reducing GEs will result in 
happier students and even happier 
professors, who no longer would 
have to teach so many disinterested 
people. In some of these courses. it 
is obvious that the instructors do 
nor want to be there. While they 
probably will not admit to this 
boredom, it is clearly 
present. What does this do to the 
students, seeing their professors 
look as listless as they feel ? or 
much good. 

Do a favor to the students and 
professors. Eliminate these outdat-
ed requirements. Give students 
more freedom and variety in the 
classes they can choose. Let tht! 
professors teach people who actual-
ly want to be there . T he more free-
dom and tlexibiliry, the better.

There is more than meets the eye 
Humans have the unique capacity to improve the world 
By TAHA A. GAYA 
Contributing Writer 

Self-recognition and its 
advanced fo rm, introspectioll, are 
two of the defining characteristics 
that we tend to think of as unique-
ly human . Yet how many of us acru-
ally reflect on the miraculous 
na ture in which we have been 
formed, be it through creation or 
evolution? 

Perhaps the mos t excellent 
example of the miraculous narure 
of the human form is the human 
visual-perceprual system. When we 
open our eyes, we are immediately 
presented with a three-dimensional 
representation of the world around 
us. 

\\'e open our eyes and we see, 
Jnd yet this process is not so sim-
ple; tt 's more complex than we ever 
ImJg1l1ed . How do we go from 
ltgln-sensi ng photoreceptor ce lls 
on the reona to a two-dimensional 
image and from there to a world 
that has depth, motion and color? 
How does the \'isual system "know" 
the boundJries of distinct objects? 
\ \ 'by IS it that when we see a pro-
peller or a wheel spi nning we 
sometimes see It as spinning in the 
opposi. ~ direcllon from the direc-
lIOn in which we know it to be 
moving' Why is It that the leading 

~dge of a mov1l1g object is distinct 
while its motion often blurs the 
trai ling edge' 

The answer lies in the va rious 
biophysical aspect of the eye, bur 
also more importantly in prob-
lem- olving shortcuts or heuris-

tic~ the brain employs to reduce 
the computational burden of per-
cc pllon . These computations are 
so complex that they have befud-
dled sClence's best efforts to repli-
CJ tC the l'lsual systel11 . It is per-
h.lps these re,eal chers who, rec-
og111zant of the ineptness of their 
UII n effons, appreciate th e human 
\ ' I~uJI system most full y and 111 a 
\\'ay thJ't should impre s upon the 

rest of us the greatness of this gift 
that we have been given and often 
take for granted. 

And it is not merely a case of 
vision against a backdrop of blind-
ness by which we should measure 
our gratitude, but by an entire 
gradient of vision. People exist 
who have defici ts that disable cer-
tain aspects of their vision . 

Cortical achromatopsia re ults 
in an inability to see color, rele-
gating the perceptual world to 
shades of gray. Balint's syndrome 
results 111 an inability to perceive 
motion, presenting the world as a

condition. 

series of tatic sna pshots instead 
of as a continuum. Bltndsight 
results in a loss of visual con-
sciousness so that, though the per-
son has the ability to see, they 
have lost the ability to perceive 
that which has been seen. 

I have tried to emphasize feelings 
of awe, humility and gratirude in 
explaining the visual system, not 
only because it is appropriate, but 
also because it is important to reflect 
outside the realm of b'l'aded curves 
and rotc memorization of class 
material. Ths reflection Will allow 
us to rerrund ourselves of the relative 
insignificance of mans achievements 
and allow us to regain J more hum-
ble and perhaps thoughtful attitude 
tOward the knowledge we :lcquil e 

and the progress we Illake. 
It is especially importJnt for 

this to occur here at UCS D 
because of our position a a 
research school. SCIence has often 
given humanity powerful tools -
tools that allow for great benefits. 
but also great abuses. The 111 0St 
recent and obvious example of this 
being chemical and bIOlogical 
weaponry, qut there have alsu 
been more historical abuses. The 
idea of eugenics - the prohibi-
tion of people with genetic "flaws" 
to reproduce in order to 
"improve" th e gene pool -
resu lted from a mis:lpplicatton of 
our understandl11g of human 
genetic here tabtl ity. The unethi-
ca l, inhumane experiments of 
Nazi scientists were carried ou t in 
the name of science ,a nd the Itst IS 
long and unfortunJte.

Children of all ages were able to 
participate in the all-campus func-
tion. Among the many activities 
ava ilable, children enjoyed llama 
rides, face painting and magicians. 

" I liked going on the Moon 
Bounce," said 4-year-old Jacob 
Baizer . 

UCSD student organiza tion 
and deparonents had booths lined 
up long Library Walk for Open 
House. The UCSD School of 
Medi ine offered free health infor-
macion, assessments and therapeu-
tiC massages. 

Various UC 0 departments had 
booths se t up With IIlformation on 
programs and opportunities for 
srudy at the universi ry. 

Other student organizations 
promoted thcir groups and upcom-
ing events. Alpha Kappa Delta Phi 
used Open House ,I!- an oppornmi-
rv to generate awareness for breast 
cancer and their upconung "Breast 
Fest." 

"We wanted to get the word out 
Jbuut our upcoming event so peo-
ple can become educated about 
breast cancer and other women 's 
issues," said Claudia Lam . 

11m Pence, one of the White 
Tiger Kung Fll performers, said 
UCSD Open House "gave us a 
good chance to promote our club 
and dcmonstra te a series of ""'hite 

'Tiger Kung Fu forms." 
Open House also served as 

UCSD's homecoming. UCSD 
alumni visited a beer garden on 
RIMA Field hosted by the Alumru 
Association, while the Athletic 
Department held homecommg 
games throughout the day. 

DanielleJacobs, a 1986 graduate 
from Muir College said, "Walking 
around brings back lots of memo-
ries. It feels much more like a major 
universi ty now." 

Not everyone on campus partici-
pated in the festivities - some sru-
dents kept their noses rucked in 
books as event-goers milled by. 

"I'm not really interested and 
I've gOt midterms," said Revelle 
Junior Camille Katigbak. 

The event was considered a suc-
cess by those who planned it. 

"We just wanted an opporrunity 
to give back to the community," 
Leyva said. "We're proud to be 
UCSD."

Management: 
School to be part of 
Roosevelt College 
Continued from page 1 
believes the new I.(raduate school will 
be designed ror ~merb.jng industries 
in California. 

"The Management chool will 
respond to tile growing need of 
CalifornIa industry for per onnel 
with strong management kills in the 
high technology and biotechnology 
sectors," Dynes stu tcd. "After exten-
sive consultation with industry and 
community members, it became 
clear to us that there was a strong 
demand for employee who arc 
skilled in technology and have man-
agcment skills as well." 

The new school will be unique 
in its curriculum emphasis by devi-
ating from the traditional business 
school program in favor of a more 
technical and technological-driven 
slant. 

International Relations/Pacific 
Studies professor Peter Cowhey, 
chair of the School of Management 
steering cOll1Jllittee, said that one of 
the key goals is "to provide the type 
of technology-ski lled managers tllat 
the San Diego commwliry needs. " 

The new school will be specifi-
cally built for the new economy. 

"We're leaning toward a strong 
focus on technology," Cow hey said. 

Some tech-driven schools, such 
as Massachusetts In titute of 
Technology'S loan School of 
Management and orthwestcrn 
Univer ity's Kcllogg School or 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2001 
Management, are being examined by 
the steering committee and could be 
models for the new management 
school. 

"Tht' mix of students will be dif-
ferent than those at the top 10 man-
agement programs in the country," 
Cow hey saId. "They will be more 
tech savvy and will include students 
with engoneenng, I.T, scIence and 
health care degrees." 

An undergraduate degree in busi-
ness affiliated with the school is not 
in the works, said econorrucs profes-
sor Theodore Groves, who is a part 
of the steering committee. 

"Business education is tradition-
ally a professional degree like law -
thats why you don't have an under-
graduate curriculum in law or an 
undergraduate curriculum in medi -
cine," Groves said. 

Howe\'er, Groves did al' that 
there would be a close connection 
between the management school 
and school deparonents. Such Inte-
gration would include management 
science courses being taught by the 
graduate school's faculty in the 
future. 

Fred Cutler, executive director of 
UCSD Corll1ect, has been in close 
contact with the San Diego business 
community and has said there has 
been overwhelmIng pOSItive feed -
back. 

''[It'sJ an extremely important 
step forward," he said. "A world-
class management school would aug-
ment tile technical a~pect. The real 
feedback we received is high-tech, 
entrepreneurial skills. It 's tllis 
crossover, tech-expcrience that is the 
wave of tile future." 

Dayton students seek 
alternative homecoming 
Administration concerned about 
'underground' events ' 

DAYTO , Ohio - Studcnts' 
"underground" efforts to stage a 
"secret" homecoming celebration 
this weekend have fai led. 

University of Dayton officials 
gOt wind of the plans to circulll -
vent the university'S ban on such 
restivities soon :Ifter word began 
circulating among students and 
Web sites popped up on UD COI11-
puters. 

UD now has its own plan ror 
"homecomi ng weekend," which 
includes increased police patrols, 
surveillance by non uniformed offi-
cers, strict visiting and parking 
restrictions, and no tolerance or dis-
orderly behavior. 

According to an e-mail mcssage 
to faculty, staff and suldents last 
week from the Office of Student 
Development, as well as other uni-
versit), departments, tile university 
plans " to ensure the security and 
safety of our campus community 
and protect its members and proper-
ty." 

The university is particularly 
concerncd because of the problems 
it had last year. 

According to univer ity offi -
cials, there were thousands orkcgs 
on campus, 18 ci tations, eIght 
arrests, five fire hydrants opened, 
street sIgns ddmaged, couches set 
on fire and morc. 

The indefinite suspension of 
homecoming was announced Jan . 5. 

Officials said the decision was 
not based on last yea r alone, but 
due to uncontrollable behavior 
demonstrated in recent years dur-
ing the weekend celebration. 

SGA directors of Public Safct), 
Ryan Dei and Shawn Masterson 
sent a list of precautions ror Stu-
dents to be aware of ror the week-
end of Oct. 18-20, including the 
fact that 10 undercover liquor 
patrol agents who arc regulated by 
the state, not the university, can 
come at any time without notice. 
They also said that approXlmatcly 
20 public safety officer and 10 CIty 
of Dayton police officers wi II he on 
campus. 

"The university administration 
recognizes that tllese actions Inay 
seem overly intrusive to thc stlldent 
population:" a univcrsit)· statement 
sa Id . 

"These actions are being put IntO 
place to deal specifically with what 
has been identified as the 'under-
ground homecoming.'" 

John Delamer, director of public 
sarety, does not believe homecoming 
will be as big as llIany people antici-
pate. 

"From listening to students and 
other administrators on campus who 
listen to smdents, there isn't a big 
indication that there will be an 
underground homecoming," he 
aid. "r think students clearly under-

stand we can't have a repetition of 
last year." 

Bllt Public Safety will be pre-
pared anyway, he said. 

"We have brought in addItional 
part-timc, on-call o fficers from 
witllin ,the city of Dayton to .Iug-
onenr US with a nUlllber of Day10n 
city police officers," he said. "The 
state liquor conn'ol will be on cam-
pus. They heard of tile upcollung 
event and they lVere velY helpful 
several years ago when we had a Sllll -
ilar statement tllat SI. Patrick 's Day 
wasn't gOll1g to get out of hand." 

Dclamer said the univerSIty has 
takcn a stronger stance each year 
against out-of-control behavior Jnd 
alcohol abuse. - . 

Since the beginning of this 
school year, he said, 10 to 12 beer-
keg citations and 93 alcohol citalions 
have heen issued. 

This is very low in comparison to 
previous years, he sa id. 

Last years homecoming resulted 
in 18 citations and eight arrcsts, all 
alcohol-related. 

The crackdown on tllC "under-
ground homecoming" IS in keeping 
with Raymond Fitzs directive to rac-
ul ty and st.1ff at tile beginning of the 
school year to work together to 
change the UD culture concerning 
alcohol.

Longboarders make their way around UCSD - for speed and love of the ride 

lIJ ings are no longer the highways to the sky. Ground-zero flight is now possible. Armed with the shoes of Mercury, he 
skims swiftly over concrete like a jet hurtling 
over clouds. He sweeps past dreary masses 
of pedestrian students who are doomed to a 
Ii fe of sore reet and raw blisters. 

Buildings blend together and the stu-
dents of UCSD blur into a diverse rainbow 
of yellow, white and brown. People and 
obstacles become cones in his slalom course 
as he weaves in and out like a skilled tapes-
try artist embroidering a quilt that says 
"Walking Sucks." 

He is riding a longboard and he is free 
from the burly grasp of this earth. 

To many, the preferred means of trans-
port around school is a longboard. The 
elongated wooden deck, extended wheel-
base, wider stance and larger wheels meant 
for smoother riding differentiate a long-
board from a skateboard. 

Often, longboards will have oddly 
shaped decks. Many are pointed for aero-
dynamics. Some pay homage to long-
boarding's surfing roots and have flat 
decks. Others have curves and are molded 
to induce an eerie, floating feeling when 
riding. The length can range from a tiny 
two feet to a massive six feet. 

One constant for alliongboards is their 
larger, softer wheels designed to soak up 
bumps, dips and cracks. Simply put, skate-
boards are designed for tricks while long-
boards are meant for cruising. Their 
capacity for higher speed and ability to 
handle cracks and pavement irregularities 
make longboards a hit among UCSD stu-
dents who prefer a fast route around cam-
pus. 

Longboarders are everywhere at UCSD. 
Though not as prevalent as skateboarders, 
they are an undeni3ble presence between 
classes. The ordy quick mode of transport that 
does not require hands, longboarding frees 
the rider to eat, drink or chat on a cell phone 
while getting from point A to point B. 

However, longboarding has its dangers. 
There have been II reported longboarding 
injuries on campus in the last five years, and 
many more unreported. Forty- fi ve percent of 
the accidents took place on Voigt Drive -
that enormous hill coming down from 
RIMAC toward Warren College. This year, a 

novice rider received multiple sti tches after 
his accident on that hill . 

The love of boarding is also seen in the 
organizations on campus. The Board Club 
gathers boarders of every genre through par-
ties, trips and other social events. Skating, 
surfing, snowboarding, mountain boarding 
and longboarding are all united under the 
Board@UCSD banner. 

Board C lub President Sean McPherson 
explained, "Longboarding is soul. Carving 
the streets is like no other. When you get the 
power slide going, it's so much like surfing, 
so much like snowboarding, but like nei ther 
one." 

Since longboarding holds its roots in surf-
ing, the two sports tend to have many com-
mon participants. 

Freshman and skilled surfer Gavin 
McClintock owns many boards and has been 
hitting the swells for the past decade. But 
when the surf is weak, he longboards. 

"Long skateboards are cool because you 
don't get speed wobbles bombing big hills, 
and if you do the blood stains are cool," 
McClintock said . 

Another ardent surfer, freshman Justin 
K1 effman, is also an avid board rider. He 
has been skateboardi ng for the past eight 
years, so longboards are nothing new to 
him . 

A surfer since junior high, K1errman 
said, "Therc's nothing like the reeling of 
hauling ass down the line - sitting right in 
the pocket. It's like you are one with the 
wave and the ocean. With skating, it's the 
same, whether you are carving down a huge 
hill, weaving through traffic, gliding down

THE EDITOR'S

Bring it on: 
insult, critique 
appreciated 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 
Features Editor 

Two of my favorite people right now are 
the men who have insulted me the mo t in 
the past week. 

The first is George Lee Liddle, III, edi-
tor in chief of the illustrious Koala. The 
second is fomler Guardill1l editor in chief 
and current California Rroirw pundit Ben 
Boychuk. 

In an Oct. 181euer to the editor, Liddle 
said I have "puerile opinions." In a piece in 
the CaliforTIia Rroirw, UCSD's conservative 
publication, Boychuk all but called me a 
"half-wit." And while I bristle at the barbs, 
I'm also grateful for them. 

They piss me off. I like being pissed off. 
I also like criticism, and while I prefer 

that it be slightly more constructive and 
specific than, say, "blow me," I'll take what 
I can get. And I won't let a few potshots 
distract me from the legitimate points 
being made. 

So I am now going to climb up on the 
soapbox and respond to my detractors.

Stress can overwhelm students, but relief is within reach

. are luc!..), enough to have our midterm can-

this kind of procrastination - and the Stress 
that it brings. 

Stress among college students runs high 
and for long periods of time. With so much 
pressure on students from trying to balance 
school, work, fami ly and friends, stress is 
lI1evitable. It is important to be able to rec-
ognize the sources of stress, its signs, symp-
toms .and how you can reduce occurrences of 
stress. 

For Strangman, the stress was incredible. 
"All day I was exci ted and stressed," she 

said: "My brain starred to shut down and 
wouldn't do anything. So instead of doing all 
of the many things I had to do that day, I did 
nothing." 

She also felt shaky, experienced problems

signs include chrollle fatigue, increased irri-
tability, a change in appetite, changes in 
behavior or emotional pa nerns, and body 
,tches and pains not cau cd by c,~ercise. A

Many students' reports of stress concur 
with Young's laundry list of stre.sor .

According to UCSD 
psychologist Linda 
Young, common stressors 
are issues of achicvemen t 
and relationship. For stu-
dents, achievement is ues

time managemenc, 
finances, status among 
peers and personal identi-
ty development. Students 
can also feel stress over

that affects students nega-
tively. 

Young agrees, and said 
that Icvels of stress that are 
too low can hamper per-
formance as well as levels 
of stress that arc too high. 

"J ust the right amount 
of challenge motivates sru-
dents to do their best 
work," she said. 

Unfortunately, finding 
this "just right" amount 
can be difficult for stu-
dents. Many students usc

"We often feel stress when we think about

these expectations," Young said. 

Specifically at UCSD, Young noted, stress

boarder Stacey Peralta, have shown up gen-

Senior Kathleen Hentz started long-
boarding when she came to UCSD. She uses 
it as transportation around campus because it 
is "way easier" than other modes of locomo-
tion. 

Sector 9, a local skate company, was 
founded in 1993 with a few regular guys 
looking for a good time. While messing 
around, they began making cheap boards 
for cruising and carving. Someone offered 
to buy a board. and eight years later Sector

judge their mark and raise their stress levels 
too much, creating anxiety and the inability 
to perform well. 

Because the workload is usually higher at 
UCSD man in high school , entering fresh -
men may miscalculate how long mey can 
afford to procrastinate before studying hard . 

9 exploded into a multimillion -dollar 
worldwide enterprise. 

Sector 9 President and co-founder Steve 
Lake said, "It's all about fun - just doing 
something different. It's about the carving, 
like we were surfing or snowboarding." 

Longboarding is a joy for those who do 
it. Every mile, foot and inch traveled is a 
pleasure - at least downhill. Next time you 
see someone swoosh by on a longboard , 
know that they are enjoying their commute 
more than they would be if they were walk-

SPOTLIGHT 

Isaac Sullivan/Cuordian 

Racking up: Students enjoy a round of poOl in the Price Center 
gameroom. 

Stress: 
Workshops teach skills 
to help combat stress 
Continued from page 11 
conclusions), dichotomous think-
ing (right-wrong, good-bad) and 
perfectionist thinking (' I'm no 
good unless I'm perfect '). Then 
find ways to nudge yourself out of 
these mental ruts. " 

Strangrn3n took adv3n tage of 
seve ral of these srres - reducing 
tccluliques during her anthropolo-
gy pa per crisi . 

"To combat my stress, T took a 
break and ran campus loop, made 
myself a salad, and drank 0) and 
water to re-hydrate myself." she 
sa id. "And I turned to my friends 
for support." 

For especially stressful life 
events, nearly all experts agree on 
what to do: Seek professional help. 

Snldents at UCSD seem to 
practice many of these techniques. 
Exercising. sleeping and going out 
with fri ends are popular methods 
of reducing stress. 

Efrat Stark, a Muir junior, said 
she tries to " look at the big picture 
and rea lize it 's not a big deal" when 
something is stressi ng her out. 
Amelia Winslow tries to prioritize 
her time by making a to-do li st and 

checki ng off each item as it is com-
pleted. 

Under normal circumstances, 
Strangrnan prevents stress by try-
ing to schedule things out in 
advance so she does not leave 
important things until the last 
minute. She also tries to remcmber 
" that most things aren't worth get-
ting stressed our about," and while 
they might seem impomnr ar the 
time, she tri es to maintJin a 
healthy perspective. 

UCSD Psychological and 
Counseling SCrVices offers a num-
ber of resources for snldeIHs feel -
ing too stressed out or who want to 
learn better timc- and stress-man-
agement skills. 

In addition to individual coun-
seling services, two workshops are 
being offered this quarter for all 
UCSD students. "Strcss 
Management Skills" is a six-session 
workshop that will teach specific, 
personalized skills to help students 
cope with stress. "Time 
Management" is another series of 
workshops designcd to assist busy 
students with managing their time 
and energy.

other resources available at

Services, visit their Web site at

made fun of in The Koala , I ca ll that 
racisnl , " 

I agree that it's completely 
ridiculous that everyone is getting 
their panties in a bunch over The 
Koala only now, when you guys 
have been offending the hell out of 
UCSD for years. If "cum-guzzling 
drag queen" (see the "Special 
Sungod Pornstar" issue of last 
spring) isn't hate speech, then what 
is? . 

Do I think what you prim is 
offensive? Sure. Am I breaking out 
my tOrch to set alight Tlu Knalo 
office and string up your senior 
staff in the eucalyptus grove? Hell 
no. 

Personally, J think when you 
come to a university like ours , you 
accept that your funds are going to 
be used to foster the free and open 
expression of people who don't 
agree with you and, in fact, make 
your stOmach rum. Obviously some 
disagree, as we saw last yea r during 
Anti -Zionism Week and are seeing 
again now. 

I don't know what the solution 
to all this brouhaha is. I didn't 
know when I sat on the editorial 
board that puzzled over what 
stance to take on the developing 
Koala controversy. 

I do know that I, for one, am 
occasionally uncomfortable with 
what I find funny. I've been 
known to laugh hysterically at a 
clever but unquestionably racist 
joke, and then go red and squirm. 
1 know I'm mppored to thunder 
down from the heavens against 
such "hate speech." Bm if it 's

after lilling in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, ocrOBER 22, 2001 

Water Polo loses in four OTs Because: always have people to do it. We're not professional sports writers. We are students first that have other 
responsibiliries that sometimes 
supercede that of the paper. In 
other words, people get busy and 
can't always go to the games. 

Long Beach State triumphs over Tritons, 12-11 
Editor challenges crittcs 
to do better 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Contributing Writer 

In what seemed to be a clash of 
the :\ICAA water polo l i tans, the 
eighth-ranked UCSD men's water 
polo tea m cha ll enged sixth-
ranked Long Beach tate at 
C.1Il)'onview Pool last Friday - a 
faceoff that resulted in a 12 - 11 
defeat for the Tritons. 

Both teams came our slrong to 
start the match, and at the end of 
the first quarter, the score was 
even at one goa l apiece. 

In the seco nd quarter, 
UCSD's AII -Amcrica n captain 
Jonath an Hopkins scored to put 
the Tritons back III the ga me. At 
thc end of the hal f, the 4gers led 
the Tri tons by a score of 4-3 
behind the superb play of Long 
Beach State's Chris Segesman, 
who had n 0 goal, In the quarter 
and fi lllshcd IVllh fi ve goals in 
[he ga me. But the g~lIll e was far 
from over. 

T he Tri tons battled back in the 
dllrd qoarter with goa ls from 
seniors Bre tt Allan anu Vladimir

score at 6-6. 

Both the Tri tons and the 4gers 
~C<J rcd th ree goal; in the fourth 
quarter, IIlciuding a crucial goal 
from Triton freshman dr iver 
Brandon Borso, who emled the 
night with two goals. Allan scored

to say that by writing on national

of all of the complaints, this one

As fo r the people who do attend

writing an article that reads like a

is only so much that we can wri te

od . 

Soon a frer the start of the se -
ond overtime , Kellan Ilotl 
stepped up for the TritOns to 
score a goal, but Long Beach ral -
lied once again and scored what 
was Segesman's fi fth goal of the 
night. 

Tied at II , the Tritons and 
the 4gers headed into the first of 
two sudden-death overtime peri-
ods, where neither team man-
aged to score. With 40 seconds 
to go in the second sudden death 
period, Long Beach State's 
Holloway rocketed the ball into 
the UCSD net to make his third 
goal of the night and take the 
victOry for the 4gers with a final 
score of 12- 11. 

"Last week we had too much 
offense, so tonight we had to dig 

deep and concentrate on our 
defense," said 4ger head coach 
Rick Azevedo after his win Friday 
night. 

Despite the loss, Triton goalie 
Lance Onken played a spectacular 
game and had two crucial saves on 
penalty shots. 

"We are growing each week 
and the focus is on us and how we 
are going to play and face the 
opponent no matter who it may 
be," Triton head coach Denny 
Harper said. 

With this loss, the Tritons fa ll 
to 14-3 for the season as Long 
Beach State improves to 6-4 over-
all.

Contrary to popular belief, 
Isaac and myself are big sports fa ns 
that do have our own ideas on the 
national sports cene. The column 
is a way for us to get these opinions 
out to the public. I guess what I'm 
trying to say is: Get over it. 

We're going to write about what 
inspires us that week. If that tOpic 
doesn't happen to be about UCSD, 
live with it. The rest of the section 
is dedicated to on-campus sports. 

Other complaints incl ude lack 
of quotes and a feeling that our 
writers don't acula lly attend the 
events that they cover. The simple 
answer to that is that not all of the 
events are covered with a reporter 
on the scene. 

Obviously, we can't go to all of 
the away games, but we also cannot 
make all of the home games either. 
While we would like to, we don't 

IfI have left any complaints out, 
I urge you to come up to the 
Gllllrditm office and talk to me or 
Isaac about them. We would love 
to hear what you have to say. 

What I don't want you doing is 
going to one of the writers, or even 
another editor on the paper, and 
complaining to them about your 
problem and criticizing our work. 
If you have beef, bring it to me. 

For those of you who love to sit 
out there and bash the sports sec-

out there), I would be wi ll ing to bet 
that 90 percent of you couldn't do a 
better job if your life depended on 
it. Want to prove me wrong? I

Flowers, now the owner of a 
financial software company, says 
intercollegiate athletics build impor-
tant skills that people need in order 
to be successful in the workforce. 

"It teaches dedication to some-
thing, whether it be sports or 
work," Flowers said. "It makes you 
goal -orientated . Working hard, 
uedicarion - getting what you 
want the old fashioned way." 

Goodman also feels that his par-
ticipati on in athletics helped him 
build a foundation of values that he 
now applies to his everyday life. 

"I gO! friendship, teamwork and 
learning how to work as a group 
and achieve a goal," Goodman said. 
"Being able to do that and win a 
national title, you saw everything 
come together and you think about 
when we came here in August and 
we ended up winning the national 
otle in ovember, and what we had 
to do to get there, the sacrifices -
you learn how to apply that to 
everyday life, whether it be your 
family or your job." 

. 

Goodman, now a financial ana-
lyst residing in Mission Viejo, 
Calif., has noticed the strides the 
campus has made to advance the 
athletic program. 

"I left in 1990, and I think it was 
1991 or 1992 when they put the 
lights on tile soccer field and had 
the ability to play night games," 
Goouman said. ' For the most parr, 
we played 011 this field my last two 
years and it was day games only 
because we didn 't have the lights 
yet. Th'1I brings out bigger, better 
crowds, and as a player you get 
more into the game when you have 
a bigger crowd ." 

He sa id he believes I lomecoming 
i va luable for current players because 
it !l'Ives tllem connections with people 
who have been in their shocs. 

"I think that it 's very impor-
tant," Goodman said. "When you 
play the sPOrt, you need that sup-
port. It shows the current players 
what they are going to see in the 
future [and] helps them under tand 
what they're doing - the sacrifices 
they make and the goal tlley're try-
ing to achieve. And what better

That's mine: UCSD freshman mldflelder DaVid Ower banles a CSU San 
Bernardino opponent for possession last Saturday at Triton Soccer Stadium. 

By ANU KUMAR 
Contributing Writer 

Heading into Saturday's game, 
the UCSD men's soccer team knew 
it would have to step up its level of 
play in the final three games of the 
regular season. Both the Tritons and 
their opponent, California State 
University San Bernardino, needed a 
win to remain in contention for the 
wildcard berth into the California 
Collegiate Atheletic Association 

hampionship Tournament. 
Ilowever, neither team managed 

to score in the match on Saturday at 
Triton occer Stadium, and the 
gamc ended with a 0-0 tic. 

The Coyotes and the Tritons 
had their fair share of scoring 
opportunities during the two 45-
minute halves of regulation and 30 
minutes of sudde n-death over-
tIIne. 

The Tritons had evera l quality 
opportunities to break the tie. With 
10 I11l1lutcS remaining in the fir t 
half, Triton mid fielder Sean 

Summers put the ball in 1T0nt of 
the goal 1T0m the corner of the 
field to set up a header, but Coyote 
goalkeeper J oseph Kulm came up 
with a diving save. 

The second overtime period 
provided UCSD with its best 
opportunity. With eight minutes 
left, freshman midfielder David 
Ower cracked a quick shot 20 yards 
away from the Coyote goal, but it 
hit the left goalpost and went Ollt of 
bounds. Ower, who led the Tritons 
in hots on goal, had three other 
attempts during the game. 

Throughout the match , the 
Tritons took good care of the ball, 
maintaining possession most of the 
time. T he UCSD midfielders 
moved the ball well, getting by the 
defense with cri sp passi ng and 
earning excellent scoring opportu-
nities. In addition, players such as 
Ower and Summers controlled the 
midfield and were able to keep the 
pressure on San Bernardino.

ball, the Triton defense looked

Volleyball stunned on the road by Warriors 
19th-ranked Triton lose to 5-7 CSU Stanislaus, falling to 9-3 in league 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Spdtts Ed itor 

T he road ca n be a very lonely 
place. It can be even lonelier when 
you lose a conference game. The 
UCSD women 's volleyba ll team 
now knows that all too well. 

The Tritons entered Thursday 
night'S encounter against 
California S tate University 
Stal1lslaus, which is ranked No. 19 
in the nation, and embarrassed 
themselves during a 3- 1 loss at 
Warrior Gym . As a result , the 
team fell to 9-3 in the Californi a 
Collegiate Athletic AsSOCIation 
and 14-5 overall. 

UCSD opened the game with 
sloppy play, little enthusiasm and 
no communication. 

"This was one of the worst pass-
ing games that I have seen in my 
years with this program," Triton 
head coach Duncan McFarland 
said. "It was keeping us from setting 
up our offense and really getting 
going. We came out a little flat. We 
weren't talking on the floor." 

The Warriors, who are IlOW 5-
7 in the CCAA and 13- 11 overall, 
jumped out to the early lead and 
never looked back. CSU Stanislaus 
was serving UCSD off the floor 
through the first two games, which 
it woo convincingly, 30-17 and 30-

23, respectively. 
" [The Warriors] served very 

well," McFarland said . "It was 
throwing our offense off." 

Stunned by the scrappy play of 
CSU Stanislaus, the Tritons rallied 
in the third game and won con-
vi ncingly, 30-23 . 

UCSD, apparently rejuvenated 
by the convincing win in game 
three, came out strl'llg again in the 
fourth . T he team was talking on the 
floor and had obvious intensity. 

"We were able to turn it arowld 
in the third game and first half of 
the fourth," M cFarland said. "We 
started passi ng the ba II better and 
talking to each other." 

The Tritons looked poised to ' 
force a deciding fifth game, leading 
by as much as 20- IO in the fourth, 
but the Warriors were not about to 
give up a 2-0 lead in their own gym. 

CSU Stanislaus came roaring 
back, taking advantage of the sloppy 
play of the UCSD squad to tie the 
game at 26. The Warriors closed 
Oil t strong to take the fourth game 
30-27 along with the match. 

Individually, the Tritons were 
led by Kathleen Hentz's eight kills 
and Jessica Bartter's 19 assists. 
Stacy Dunsmore added six kills. 

CSU Stanislaus was led by 
'Amanda Oliver's 14 kills and 
Valerie Lopez's 41 assists. 

strong and prevented the Coyo(e 
from setti ng an offensive rhythm. 
San Bernardino's forwards had a 
diffi cult time penetrating the 
UCSD defenders to get a good 
shOt. Although sophomore Triton 
goalkeeper Jeremy Cookson was 
forced to make eight savt!s during 
the 120 minutes, he wa never 
challenged with :I threatening 
CoyOte shOt. 

Despite playing a soltd all -
around game, the Tritons bcked 
the one strong attack that would 
have given them the lead against 
the Coyotes. This game marks the 
fifth game of the season in which 
U SD has been shut OUt offen-
sively. However, its ITOnt line has 
been hindered by thc absence of 
enior All-American forward 

Bobby Saadati, who has becn side-
lined the entire season with an 
injury. 

"This i a real blow for us," 
Armstrong said. "A win would have 
given us a chance and put us in a 
much better position." 

because 

love sports. I 
always have. I've 

been writing sports 
for more -tlian four 
years now and I 
never get tired of it. 

While I acknowledge that I have 
a lot of room for improvement, I 
would like to think that I do a pret-
ty good job. 

With that in mind, I have been 
a little disturbed by some of the 
things that I've been hearing on 
campus lately about my beloved 
sports section. I reali ze that I can 't 
please everyone, but at the same 
time, I tire of hearing cOlllpl ai nts 
that can't or shouldn't be remedied. 
These are the ones that 1 want to 
add ress now. 

One of the biggest complaints 
that I hear 1T0m people is the lack 
of coverage that we give to sports 
at UCSD. These complaints usual -
ly come from the people who are 
invloved in SportS or who have 
close friends who are. I rea li ze that 
they want coverage. They should . 

My dilemma is that I can 't cover 
every sport every week. There just 
isn't enough room in the section -
which, if you'll notice, isn't that 
large - for me to write huge arti -
cles on every sport. I try to spread 
the coverage around. If you're 
unhappy with it, let me know. I'll 
try to work something out. Don't 
just sit and bitch Wout it to people 
who can't do anything about it. 

Another complaint that r get, 
almost as often, is the content of 
the col umns written by Isaac and 
myself. I say that this complaint 
comes up often, but that is a little 
deceiving. It basically comes from a 
few people over and over. Their 
main complaint is that the columns
