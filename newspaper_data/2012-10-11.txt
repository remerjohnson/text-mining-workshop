SURF REPORT

By ReBecca hoRwitz
Associate News Editor

John Muir College Provost Susan Smith has announced that she will step down from her position 
at the end of Winter Quarter 2013. 
Smith, who says that she will retire 
from both her provost position and 
her teaching post, began teaching 
at UCSD in 1986 and became Muir 
provost in 2005.

“I’ve been provost for about sev-
en-and-a-half years and I’m just at 
a point where I’m at an age where 
people tend to retire, and I have a 
lot of other projects that I want to 
pursue in retirement,” Smith said.

 Smith joined Muir’s adminis-
tration in 1990, after the college 
became the sponsor of the Women’s 
Studies program, now named 
Critical Gender Studies.

“Since my scholarly work involves 
women and their relationship to the 
arts, I thought, ‘Wow, I can really 
get behind a college that sponsors 
women’s studies,’” Smith said.

Visual arts is Smith’s specialty. 
She used to teach courses such as 
introduction to art history, senior 
honors and specialized upper divi-
sion classes in medieval art. She 
created a course called “Castles, 
Cathedrals and Cities,” which is usu-
ally offered Spring Quarter. She was 
chair of the visual arts department 
from 2000-04. Since becoming pro-
vost, she has only been able to teach 
a freshman honors seminar for Muir 
College.

Smith says that working with the 
Muir staff has been one of her favor-
ite parts of the job, because she sees 
how much the administration does 
for the college. 

“I think the Muir staff is really 
terrific; they make my job possible,” 
Smith said. “I’ve just come to such 
an appreciation of what the college 
staffs do for students. That’s been a 
highlight.”

The design of the Tamarack 

Apartments was one of Smith’s 
proudest projects as Muir Provost.  
The Tamarack housing commit-
tee, consisting of staff, students and 
architects, wanted to make sure that 
the new building would be con-
sistent with the existing architec-
tural style. She said that the Muir 
College design is considered to be 
an exemplary collection of midcen-
tury modern buildings by historians 
and architects. Two of the original 
architects of the college, Dale Naegle 
and Robert Mosher, were part of the 
committee.

“I’m very proud of Tamarack 
and what we accomplished with that 
because a different building could 
really be disruptive to the college, 
but where Tamarack is positioned, 
it does work,” Smith said. “It doesn’t 
duplicate the old buildings, but it 
has the same kind of style and spirit 
as our other residence halls.”

Smith is also proud of reinstitut-
ing the Muir Wilderness and Human 
Values course. It was a course started 
by Muir’s first provost, John Stewart. 
The course was about wilderness 
ideas and theories as well as preser-
vation and the history of local preser-
vation. Stewart took the students on 
backpacking field trips where they 
explored the woods. Undergraduate 
students were allowed to be TAs. 
After Stewart retired, the course was 
dropped. Smith revived the class and 
it is now being taught as an environ-
mental studies course.  

When she retires, Smith plans 
to spend more time in northern

Discusses 
New Fund 
Guidelines

Following the announcement that 
A.S. Council faces a budget deficit of 
$268,000, Vice President of Finance 
Bryan Cassella held informal forums 
during the week of Monday, Oct. 8, 
to address the concerns of students 
and staff. Cassella said the confer-
ences aimed to foster openness and 
transparency as the new council tries 
to resolve the deficit it inherited 
from its predecessors.

The deficit is the result of a fail-
ure to pay off large expenditures 
from previous councils, as well as an 
over-allocation of funds five years 
ago that totaled almost $110,000.

To address the debt, council held 
negotiations to make internal bud-
get cuts that amounted to 5 per-
cent for each A.S. office. Council 
agreed that the entire deficit could 
not be addressed in one year.  The 
Guardian reported on Oct. 8 that 
Cassella and other officers created a 
10-year plan to gradually reduce the 
financial burden.

Cassella hopes that the effect of 
the cuts on student activities will be 
minimal.

“It’s hard to hide $150,000 in 
cuts,” Cassella said. “But our goal is 
to pursue a plan that has the least 
impact on students’ experiences at 
UCSD.” 

Council has already cut funding 
to student organizations from $500 
to $100. 

A.S. Council is looking for ways 
to conduct student events more effi-
ciently. The 2012-13 A.S. Funding 
Guide now includes a structure 
for funding requests that allocates 
financing based on expected stu-
dent attendance. Smaller events can 
request up to $150 in funds, while 
funding for events that have over 500 
students will be capped at $9,000. 
Cassella hopes that an emphasis on 
accountability will prevent cutting 
student events altogether. 

Council has also instituted an 
underwriting policy that allows 
student organizations to apply for 
interest-free loans up to $10,000, as 
long as they repay the loan within 60 
days. In the event that the organiza-
tion does not repay its underwrite, 
the VP Finance can order a hold 
on the principal members’ academic 
registrations.

Muir Provost to 
Step Down 

SPORTS

New Law Protects Calif. Student-Athletes
By Rachel uda
Senior Staff Writer

State legislators have approved a 
bill (Senate Bill 1525) that requires 
certain California universities to con-
tinue distributing scholarship funds 
to athletes who have sustained career-
ending injuries.

The bill, proposed by Sen. Alex 
Padilla (D–Calif.), will introduce the 
“Student Athlete’s Bill of Rights,” at 

the start of the 2013-14 school year.
Padilla cited a 16-year survey con-

ducted by the NCAA and the Journal 
of Athletic Training, which deter-
mined that many students whose 
athletic scholarships were withdrawn 
were unable to attain their degrees.

The bill will require affected insti-
tutions to grant an equivalent schol-
arship to athletes dismissed due to 
injury for at least five years, or until 
the athlete has completed his or her 

undergraduate degree. SB 1525 also 
requires institutions to cover related 
insurance deductibles and healthcare 
premiums.

The legislation only applies to 
universities that generate more than 
$10 million in annual revenue from 
intercollegiate athletic media rights. 
The only universities in California 
that currently fall above that thresh-
old are UC Berkeley, UCLA, Stanford 
University and the University of 

Southern California.
SB 1525 may soon impact San 

Diego State University as a result of 
its recent move to the Big East con-
ference, which has a more lucrative 
television contract.

The bill will not affect UCSD, 
because its only means of compensa-
tion is a $500 scholarship awarded to 
student athletes every academic year.

UCSD Study Shows Facebook Fosters Voter Participation
By alexsandRa
konstantinovic
Contributing Writer 

A study led by UCSD researchers 
indicates that 340,000 more people 
may have voted in the 2010 election 
due to a single message on Facebook. 

The study conducted on the social 
media outlet focused on the effects 
of friends on political mobilization. 
In the experiment, over 60 million 
people were shown a non-partisan, 
“Get Out And Vote” banner on 
Election Day that included a click-
able “I Voted” button, links to polling 
places and a counter. Approximately 
600,000 Facebook users were shown 
an identical message, but with the 
addition of pictures of friends who 
had already voted. A separate control 
group wasn’t given a message. 

According to the study, Facebook 
users who saw the message with their 
friends’ pictures were far more likely 

to both search for a polling place and 
to click the “I Voted” button. 

The experiment was careful to 
cross-reference voting records to 
eliminate the number of people who 
clicked the button without actually 
voting. 

For researchers, the results sug-
gested that peer pressure is an effec-
tive way to bring voters to the polls, 
and that social media is valuable in 
influencing real-world behavior. 

Researchers also determined that 
the strength of the message’s impact 
relied significantly on close relation-
ships. 

Subjects were far more like-
ly to vote if they saw pictures of 
friends whom they later described 
to researchers as “close friends in 
real life.”

The study emphasized that even 
though the effect per single message 
was small, the real political tool lies 
in the reach that Facebook provides.

In a statement on the UCSD News 
Center website, James Fowler, the 
UCSD professor of political science 
who led the study, said, “The main 
driver of behavior change is not the 
message — it’s the vast social net-
work. Whether we want to get out 
the vote or improve public health, we 
should not only focus on the direct 
effect of an intervention, but also on 

the indirect effect as it spreads from 
person to person to person.”

Further research will try to deter-
mine which people are most effective 
in the mobilization process, and what 
kind of messages best increase voter 
participation.

As Muir Provost, Smith has had 
to put her research projects on hold. 
She looks forward to finishing a 
book she is writing on women in 
medieval art. She also would like to 

start a project about 19th-century 
popular photography.

Smith said she would like to be 
involved with UCSD after her retire-
ment, but does not know what form 
this involvement will take. She also 
applauded the six-college system 
that UCSD has because it gives stu-
dents more choices for general edu-
cation requirements. 

“UCSD students are very smart; 
they have two affinities or more, like 
athletics and whatever it happens to 
be,” Smith said. “The loyalty they 
have is very impressive. I come out 
of my seven years as provost a big 
fan of the UCSD colleges.

Stanford University is the only 
institution that has publicly opposed 
the bill thus far. In a letter of oppo-
sition, Stanford Interim Athletic 
Director Patrick Dunkley argued that 
the bill discriminates against the four 
universities affected.

“It applies just to four universities 
out of scores of institutions of higher 
education in California and fails to 
protect the rights of the vast majority 
of student-athletes,” Dunkley said of 

the bill. “Why should a Stanford foot-
ball player have protections provided 
by law that are denied a football 
player at San Jose State?”

It is unclear how the law will 
impact the affected universities in 
NCAA competition.

According to a 2010 survey con-
ducted by the Office of Postsecondary 
Education, Stanford allots more 
money for student-athlete scholar-
ships than the other three affected 
universities. The survey reported that 
the university spends $16.5 million 

on its 987 student-athletes. UCLA 
was reported to spend the least 
amount of money, at $9.7 million for 
their 879 athletes.

California passed SB 1525 with 
a 24–10 vote without a debate on 
the Senate floor. However, detrac-
tors argue that institutions should 
be allowed to seek out other ways to 
provide medical compensation for 
their athletes.

Council Talks Voter Registration; 
ERC is Top Recruiter of  New 

During this week’s A.S. meeting, Steve Nash put some of his virtuoso skills on 
display against the Trailblazers in his 
second game in 
a Laker uniform, 
one of the better 
parts of the council 
meeting.

Meanwhile, 
in the Forum on 
the fourth floor 
of Price Center, 
Student Organized 
Voter Access Committee Chair Arysha 
Sharifian gave council an update 
on SOVAC’s progress in registering 
incoming freshman during move-
in weekend. The college with the 
highest voter registration was Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, followed by Revelle, 
Sixth, Marshall and Muir Colleges, all 
with over 200 each. The Village and 
Warren College both registered fewer 
than 50. Warren Senator Hugh Tran 
promised that Warren registration 
figures will improve, even if he has 
to go door to door to get students to 
register himself.

“I’m really excited to be here now 
sharing that experience with y’all and 
making that experience possible,” 
Sharifian said.

Sharifian also presented a SOVAC 
comic which featured characters 
including legislative llama, polarized 
polar bear and democracy deer; he 
plans on making this comic strip a 
quarterly feature. He reminded council 
that SOVAC will be hosting a mayoral 
debate this Saturday on campus in 
addition to its slice of democracy event 
Oct. 22 with professor Thad Kousser. 
The event will feature pizza and ballot 
information.

“Are you aware of our budget 
deficit?” a senator asked Sharifian 
after he presented next year’s SOVAC 

budget, which asked for an iPad.
Council watched a video of Cody 

Marshall doing a “Gangnam style” 
parody in Nicaragua in airports 

and rural 
neighborhoods 
with various 
schoolchildren, 
adorable.

VP of External 
Olamide Noah 
showed council 
a chart of the 
devastating effects 

that Prop. 30 could have on tuition. 
If the proposition fails, tuition is 
expected to skyrocket within the next 
few years.

AVP Concerts & Events Eric 
Babajanian reminded council that 
Bear Garden is this Friday, and said 
that the line-up for Hullabaloo, held 
Nov. 16, will be released next week. He 
added that ASCE will be partnering 
with KDST for a show in the spring.

A.S. President Meggie Le said that 
she had been meeting with Chancellor 
Khosla about the UCOP tax and 
refinancing some of A.S. debt. She 
announced that Geisel library will be 
open 24 hours for Week 10 and Finals 
Week.

Council discussed changing the 
AVP appointment process after the 
controversies that occurred during last 
year’s AVP appointment.

“When you come in here, I don’t 
care what AVP you are, you have 
to argue in front of this council; if a 
week before that you’re not ready to 
talk to this council about how you’re 
qualified, how are you going to come 
in here and argue for your budget?” 
Leonard Bobbitt asked.

Councilmembers ultimately 
decided that candidates would be need 
to be approved by council after a 4/5 
approval by the selection committee.

In light of  A. S. Council cutting student org funding 
again, its members need to closely monitor the activities 
of  said orgs to ensure funding is being used properly.

ediTORial

Seasons happen at UCSD like clockwork. Take the Greek system for example. Right 
now it’s rush week. It means the 
fraternities are chilling on Library 
Walk behind painted booths. There’s 
an overabundance of rush shirts. 
Girls dash around PC in well-dressed 
packs. And, among other things, there 
hasn’t been a Greek party all week.  

But when rush ends and the 
booths and peppy recruitment shirts 
are gone, Greek life won’t suddenly go 
into hibernation. Take a careful look 
around campus next week. You’ll see 
some freshman men proudly sporting 

shiny new pledge pins on their chests. 
Notice the tables pushed together 
in Price Center. Check out the rock 
garden in HSS. And if you still aren’t 
getting it, spend about a minute in 
RIMAC and you’ll understand. 

The idea of being immersed in 
Greek life may seem like an alien 
college experience. Bros casually 
walk into class in “Greek Life” 
tanks, painfully aware of UCSD’s 
social reputation. Every chapter is 
purportedly different, though the 
connotation associated with each 
set of Greek letters is obscured from 
those not in the know. 

Yet this detached viewpoint of 
Greek life completely misses out on 
what it’s like to be Greek. There’s a 
reason why so many of your peers are 
Greek, and a reason why they wear it 
on their sleeves. Given the climate at 
this school, many are proud to take 
part in the type of student experience 
Greek life offers. And despite UCSD’s 
size, Greeks are part of a small 
community. They have access to a 
stable environment where they are 
able to mature as they go through 
college, learning the skills needed to 
lead the chapters they once rushed.  

If you know where to look, there 
are signs of Greek activity all around 
campus. But these don’t reveal 
anything about what it’s like being a 
Greek at UCSD.  

My point here is this. Given the 
size of UCSD, there are all sorts 
of different campus communities 
engaged in different ways. What they 
do and their impact at UCSD is often 
misunderstood as well. I think that 
anyone who feels that “SD” actually 
stands for “Socially Dead” simply isn’t 
paying close enough attention, or they 
just haven’t found their niche yet.  

I’m starting my fifth year at 
UCSD. This column, in which I will 
focus on student life, will be my first 
time writing for the Guardian. If 
you read this column, I want to help 
you understand everything from the 
realities of Greek life to the inner 
workings of our student government. 
I want to articulate the moments 
of frustration, utter confusion and 
collegiate elation that we feel as 
students at this school. In short, I 
want to write what students intuitively 
feel, but no one publicly speaks about.

So, pay attention to what you see 
around you on campus. Or if you like, 
just pay attention, and every other 
week over the coming year, I’ll do my 
best to break it down for you.

 A.S. Council is once more slash-
ing funds for student orgs. Down 
from $500 last year, the maximum 
annual grantable amount to student 
orgs is now at a meager $100 per 
year. A cut this drastic raises the 
question of whether council’s fund-
ing processes for student orgs have 
been working. The answer is easy 
— they haven’t.

Although the council provides 
services such as A.S. Safe Rides and 
A.S. Lecture Notes, it is a common 
conception that the council most 
directly affects the students through 
student org funding. This year’s 
council must deal with a $268,000 
deficit inherited from last year’s 

council — a consequence of large 
expenditures, miscalculations of 
budgeting and an over-allocation of 
funds from the past five years total-
ing $110,000. Although it is hard to 
predict the under-enrollment that 
caused some of the deficit, because 
of this, last year’s council over-
allocated $110,000 and overspent 
by $70,000. This year’s council has 
already made $154,000 in cuts, 
from internal budget cuts of 5 per-
cent from each office.

This deficit has led council to 
cut back on funds for student orgs 
and reevaluate its fiscal plan for this 
year. As council does so, it needs to 
specifically focus on an overhaul 

of how it handles funding for stu-
dent orgs. Vice President of Finance 
Bryan Cassella is planning to cre-
ate a 10-year finance plan that he 
will present at the end of the year, 
aimed at helping future councils 
make long-term financial decisions. 
The multi-year plan — which will 
include a plan to pay back the defi-
cit — is a great idea and will hope-
fully compensate for the previous 
lack of long-term planning.

According to the 2012-13 A.S. 
Funding Guide, the Office of 
Finance and Resources is working 
to modify several of its financial

Did you know that not one staff 
member or student within the Crafts 
Center was notified of the closure 
prior to Sept. 26, only a mere nine 
days from the start of the first class? 
I would be horrified as an instructor 
to find out via email that my job 
no longer exists. I can’t believe the 
way the university handled this. The 
history of the center alone, and the 
fact that its glassblowing courses are 
famous for being the best institution 
in San Diego to learn from, would 
have hopefully crossed the minds 
of the administration when they 
were trying to figure out what 
facility needed monetary support. I 

understand the need for renovation, 
and can see where the $1.5 million 
in costs would be as the facility is 
so old, but the point there that they 
don’t mention is that no renovation 
happens overnight, and the university 
would (had they chose to support 
the center financially) be paying for 
renovations over several years. They 
claim $1.27 million needed to be 
spent this year, and I want to know 
what they meant. Could it have been 
less had they only shut down part 
of the center? Could they just have 
limited classes rather than cutting 
the program entirely? Where was the 
$1.27 million going?  The estimated 
costs of renovation for the crafts 
center appears to be a tiny fraction 
of the Price Centers upgrade, but I 
am sure the university has already 

allowed for those renovations to be 
started. 
       The fact that the administration 
thinks that the Crafts Center is 
a large yearly expense is absurd. 
When looking at the cost difference 
between the fees and the total costs 
per year, there is only a $217,000 
difference. Not only could a very 
large portion of that be raised, with 
all the fundraisers already planned by 
the staff, but furthermore, had UCSD 
chosen to announce the budgetary 
issues, alumni and donors would 
have been far more likely to donate. 
I have no doubt that the difference 
in cost could have been raised by the 
end of the 2012-13 academic year.

The administration not 
only forgot to make any public 
announcement of financial issues, 

but they left a fully working Crafts 
Center website up and allowed for 
enrollment. I don’t know if it was 
a number-crunching issue that 
wasn’t found till last minute or if 
it was intentionally kept quiet as 
the university didn’t want to deal 
with the protest or fallout of their 
decision, but the fact that they shut 
down the website and won’t even 
allow anyone to look at what used 
to be offered to students is in my 
opinion an intentional choice in 
order to avoid students seeking 
information about the facility. I 
attended UCSC as an undergrad 
and was a tour guide for campus, 
and what the administration does 
not seem to understand at all is that 

Crafts Center’s Sudden Closure Was Easy Funding Solution That Will Only Damage UCSD’s Reputation

6  THE UCSD GUARDIAN |   THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG Arts & EntErtAinmEnt

L ast week, my television-illiterate friend asked me on Facebook if I could help her find a new TV 
show to watch. This simple request 

spawned a 140-message comment 
thread where our friends debated 
the merits of their favorite shows, 
culminating in a series of insults as to 
whether our friend could handle the 
“cuteness” of “Modern Family.”

We didn’t have much to work with. 
Our friend (for the sake of clarity, 
we’ll call her Angela, because that’s 
her real name) doesn’t exactly watch 
too many television shows. Her pref-
erences: “Maury,” “Jerry Springer,” 
“Matlock” and “Veronica Mars.” But I 
suppose I’m not one to judge — I did 
grow up watching “America’s Most 
Wanted” for family TV nights. 

Thus began the television bracket, 
which fans of the Guardian may 
have already seen. To everybody else, 
which is to say, everybody else, the 
staff took a pricey-but-worth-it break 
from production to create a bracket 
of shows to help Angela. When the 
editor-in-chief asks us to jump, we ask 
how high. It was still much less dra-
matic than the arm-wrestling tourna-
ment. But I digress.

The comedy bracket featured off-
beat choices (mainstream favorites 
“30 Rock” and “Modern Family” were 
ruled out): “Parks and Recreation,” 
“The Office,” “Louie,” “Avatar the Last 
Airbender,” “Arrested Development” 
and “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” On 
the dramatic side, the choices were 
catered to Angela’s air of gloom 
and included “Battlestar Galactica,” 
“Game of Thrones,” “The Wire,” 
“Dexter,” “Downton Abbey” and 
“Breaking Bad.” 

I believe I must explain some 
of our choices. “Avatarz: The Last 
Airbender” was included because my 
friend once claimed that she was a 
“brony” (in actuality, she enjoyed phi-
losophizing about the first episode). 
“Sherlock,” the BBC mini series that 
spawned a semi-hysterical fandom, 
was eliminated based purely on the 
fact that our friend group likes the 
show too much. 

Our selection process meant that 
the staff took turns giving presenta-
tions about our favorite shows. My 
description of “Avatar” as “the Dalai 
Lama with superpowers” was not con-
vincing, but when our sports editor 
flounced into the room and declared 
that the characters of “Downton 
Abbey” are “fabulously dressed,” it was 
enough to make “Breaking Bad” fall 
in the first round. Yes, that “Breaking 
Bad.” Somewhere, half-faced Gus 
Fring is rolling in his grave.

The entire argument for Curb 
Your Enthusiasm was “Larry David,” 
and for that reason, it floundered 
in the first round to the fan favorite 
“Arrested Development.” And like 
most of the public, none of us had 
actually seen “The Wire” — we’d just 
heard that it was good. Angela kept 
harboring a creepy, almost-obsessive 
interest in serial-killer drama “Dexter” 
and threw out “Game of Thrones” 
early on, possibly to spite me. 

In the end, “Battlestar Galactica” 
and “Arrested Development” won. 
But in the end, the real winner of the 
night was our editor-in-chief, who 
got her entire staff to drop everything 
they were working on to help her 
choose a television show. If only all of 
our indecisions could be solved with a 
hyperactive, opinionated staff.

The Sound 
and the Fury

Elite Gymnastics’ James Brooks chats with the Guardian about 
K-pop, the departure of his bandmate Josh Clancy and his upcoming 

performance with Grimes at UCSD’s Porter’s Pub.

By arielle sallai • managing editor / illustration By reBekah dyer

T o some, electronic pop act Elite Gymnastics’ James Brooks will always be known as “j_brooks.” That’s his username on the forum Hipinion — an invite-only vir-
tual Mecca for music nerds across the world. As of press time, 
his last post was on the thread was “Taylor Swift - Red (10/22) 
HYPE THREAD.” It reads, “this song fucking RULES,” and it’s 
about “I Knew You Were Trouble” — the country star’s so-called 
dubstep track produced by pop stalwart Max Martin.

That might be a surprising declaration to those unfamiliar 
with the artist. Brooks’ long Neil Young coif doesn’t scream 
Taylor Swift fan, yet the dude makes one thing clear: He loves 
pop music. The sample-based work of the critically acclaimed 
Ruins series (released last year) draws inspiration from K-pop, 
hip-hop, house music, ’90s female singer-songwriters and more. 

But the moniker wasn’t always a mask for one. Elite 
Gymnastics was a duo until visual artist Josh Clancy departed 
earlier this year. Though Brooks writes all of the songs, at the 
time of Clancy’s departure, the group had already booked a tour 
with like-minded pop auteur Grimes. As a result, Brooks had to 
find the confidence to perform solo and rework his live show.  

That show will play to a sold-out crowd at UCSD’s own 
Porter’s Pub tonight. Brooks gave us an idea of what to expect 

from a phone call at a tour stop in Arizona, in which he dis-
cussed these changes to the project, “Gangnam Style” and his 
unwavering dedication to pop music — Korean or otherwise.

Guardian: How’s the tour going?
James Brooks: It’s been great — the best possible tour. We’re 

in a big van that has Wi-Fi and I’m the only guy on the tour, 
which will probably never happen again given how the music 
industry is.  

Whenever we have time off, we end up going to fabric stores 
and load up on fake moss and fake flowers and all this crafty stuff 
we don’t really need to try to make the presentation look prettier. 
And we have big stuffed replicas of the main character from the 
movie “My Neighbor Totoro” and they sit on the stage and are 
basically part of the band. 

G: How has performing without Josh affected your stage con-
fidence?

JB: The first show in Montreal was my first time being by 
myself in front of a large group of people, so I kind of had a 
minor Fiona Apple breakdown on stage. But after that, every-

The Sweet Escape
Affleck’s political thriller deftly tackles drama 
and comedy, supported by an Oscar-worthy 
ensemble cast.
By Rusteen HonaRdoost• staff WRiteR

See GYMNASTICS, page 8

I t’s October, the month when the leaves start to die and the Oscar bait comes out to play. It 
can be a stuffy time, full of preten-
tious melodrama and 
period pictures that look 
so tedious they couldn’t 
possibly be enjoyable (I’m 
looking at you, “Lincoln”). 
A-list actors slum it in 
ugly makeup and put on 
ridiculous vocal affects 
in order to win that spe-
cial golden statue. But sometimes 
a movie comes along well within 
these cookie-cutter boundaries 
that still manages to make you feel 
something. “Argo” is a film that 
deserves many awards for making 
you feel a great many things. That it 
manages to make you laugh, scream 
and maybe even cry all in a tightly 

choreographed 120-minute package 
is something truly remarkable.

Of the few actors to successfully 
transition to directing, only those 

with severe gravitas 
were able to do it suc-
cessfully — your Clint 
Eastwoods, your Robert 
Redfords. But when 
Ben Affleck premiered 
his debut feature “Gone 
Baby Gone” only a few 
years after the double-

whammy of “Gigli” and “Daredevil” 
(the peak of the Ben Affleck back-
lash that felt like it would never 
end), its success couldn’t be attribut-
ed to low expectations. Affleck had 
bested the odds and crafted a film 
that was full of twists and turns, but 
with an emotional core that left an 
indelible mark on its audience. His 

follow-up, “The Town,” was some-
thing totally different: a heist movie 
with a bigger cast and even larger 
ambitions. While it was an expertly 
crafted blockbuster, it didn’t inspire 
the same passion as his debut and 
felt interchangeable with the work 
of any other lesser-known director.

“Argo” changes course for 
Affleck’s directorial career by invest-
ing more into his premise than 

making it a tight thriller. “Argo” has 
something to say about the world of 
1979, and by comparison the world 
we live in today. In the film, no one, 
not even the Iranian people, see the 
1979 revolution coming. It comes 
so far out of left field that, when 
we jump right into the embassy 
moments before it is raided, no one

B ronzed body beautiful blonds, long-haired surfer dudes, Cal frat boys or hippy pot-heads? 
We’ve heard a lot about Californians 

and seen a few who meet these 
stereotypes. Being two British girls, 
we can’t help but wonder what they 
think about us, and whether we too 
will undergo ‘Californication.’ 

Meet Mia and Lara. We live in 
London, study at the University of 
Edinburgh (in Scotland) and have 
now ventured to California for a 
year. On arriving, we did not know 
each other very well, but we have 
grown a lot closer since landing on 
the Golden Coast. Now living on 
campus, we are eager to share with 
you what America and UCSD have 
to offer two British girls. Since liv-
ing in International House, we have 
been introduced to delicious bur-
ritos, sweated profusely at I-House 
parties and, most significantly, have 
been introduced to the Panhellenic 
system. Like Thanksgiving, sororities 
simply do not exist at home.

P aperdoll Salon is an easy storefront to spot on the bar-heavy Garnet Avenue 
in Pacific Beach. Stuck between an 
Irish pub and a sports bar, the salon 
is one of the few signs of female 
life on the ultimate bro row of San 
Diego. 

But looks can be deceiving, and 
Paperdoll isn’t your typical frou-
frou salon. The hairdressers don’t 
wear all black and clack around in 
heels. You might hear them playing 
the Smiths on the stereo. Best of all: 
They serve beer. For free.

The salon caters to ladies and 
men of all styles, with a selection 
of eight stylists and two estheti-
cians that have a diverse range of 
creative expression. Just judge them 
by some of their looks (that is, after 
all, their job): There’s the beach-
blonde Laura, most often seen in 
sandals and floral maxi dresses, and 
the tatted Priscilla, who will gladly 

trade stories from adolescent punk 
rock days. The former is a whiz 
with color and the latter specializes 
in razor cuts. 

They use mainly Bumble and 
Bumble products, setting a stan-
dard price range of $50 for women 
and $30 for men. Regular clients 
can also return for free bang trims 
from their stylist ($5 if it’s a differ-
ent stylist), making the hefty price 
tag less of a burden on the cash-
strapped college student. Full color 
starts at $70, while highlights start 
at $110. 

Another plus: The salon is easily 
accessible via the 30 bus route, so 
those stuck on campus don’t have 
to resort to the Supercuts in the 
La Jolla Village Square shopping 
center; a cut and a (beer) buzz are 
totally within reach.

Ace Script Makes Up for Bland Cinematography
inside understands the magnitude 
of what is about to happen. The six 
would-be hostages who manage to 
escape via a back door are turned 
away by the Brits and Kiwis until 
they find an ally in the Canadian 
ambassador. This marks one of 
those rare occurrences in American 
history in which we can un-iron-
ically thank our neighbors to the 
north.

Our refugees find their hide-
out, but getting out of the embassy 
was just the easy part. With only 
bad ideas on the table, Affleck’s 
CIA agent Tony Mendez comes up 
with the “crazy idea that just might 
work.” Disguised as a Canadian film 
crew, Mendez will fly into Tehran 
alone, meet with the six Americans 
and then bring them all back home. 
Sounds pretty easy, huh?

Affleck does a superb job of 
showing all the logistics and hurdles 
that go into this plan, from organiz-
ing the fake production company 
for the fake movie with a real script 
and real producer (played by the 
great Alan Arkin, sure to be nomi-
nated for Best Supporting Actor). 
Zipping from D.C. to Hollywood to 
Iran and back again, “Argo” keeps 
the stakes high by making every 
little piece as important as the last. 
Getting the movie put in the latest 
issue of Variety becomes as crucial 
to the success of the mission as the 
fake passports.

But the main problem with 
“Argo” is that all these actions can 
feel like they’re in a bubble, with 
little standing in the way of Affleck’s 
plan other than the plan itself. The 
closest thing to an antagonist is 
a menacing Iranian intelligence 
officer who is always a dozen steps 
away from discovering the refugees, 
but never feels like much of a threat 

when he spends most of the movie 
safely behind a desk. This is con-
founded by the utilitarian cinema-
tography, which keeps things simple 
and forces the script to bring the 
electric charge that makes the movie 
so exhilarating.

But this is just one small nag-
ging problem in a film that still 
manages to be remarkably tight and 
well-coordinated. Affleck’s direction 
makes everything from stamping 
paperwork to handing over a busi-
ness card as tense as a firing squad, 
and each of the six refugees has 
enough personality to make you 
actually want them to survive. 

It’s funny enough that Affleck 
gave himself the most thankless 
role of the whole film, which pro-
vides him neither the humor that 
makes his partners in the CIA and 
Hollywood so enjoyable nor the 
emotion that makes the refugees so 
intriguing. Instead, he spends the 
movie in the same sense of calm 
that you’d expect from an actual 

CIA agent. Plus he’s saddled with 
that ridiculous haircut.

Regardless of Affleck’s ’70s 
mop, part of “Argo”’s power (and a 
large part of its appeal to Academy 
voters) is the way it illustrates the 
potential of filmmaking. It is also 
a political story of international 
collaboration and turmoil, a time 
in American history in which the 
unthinkable happened. 

Connections to the modern day 
abound in this period piece, wheth-
er it’s the recent embassy attacks in 
Libya or the unpredictable nature 
of terrorism that makes it capable 
of bringing down embassies and 
towers alike. Affleck brings a lot of 
brains to “Argo,” and he manages 
to connect them with everything 
that makes a movie fun to watch. 
Whether he’ll be able to make a film 
that can continue his growing ambi-
tion while still holding onto that 
personal touch that made his debut 
so refreshing has yet to be seen, but 
the future looks mighty bright.

thing’s been fine. The specific kind of 
show that I do is really kind of per-
formance art-y, because with the kind 
of music it is, there’s not a lot of space 
for me to get up on stage and play an 
instrument. That’s not how I make the 
records anyway, so it would be kind of 
dishonest for me. 

Even logistically, I don’t know how 
I would create a live show based on 
Elite Gymnastics music that was about 
musicianship. That’s not anything 
that happens during the project. It’s 
more about thinking about music in 
interesting ways and arranging simple 
component pieces of music into 
something hopefully more interesting. 

G: In terms of the live perfor-
mance then, do you feel liberated by 
Josh’s departure?

JB: Josh is much more aestheti-
cally minded than I am. I’m definitely 
concerned with visual stuff or what-
ever, but for him it’s a more militantly 
aestheticized outlook on performance. 
Like we would play in the dark and 
the projections would be more preva-
lent on stage than either of us. He’d 
not be super into the idea of me talk-
ing to the audience, so you wouldn’t 
get a sense of the human beings 
behind the music. 

It improves the entire thing a great 
deal when I don’t have to accommo-
date for what makes him comfortable 
on stage. It’s not that I don’t value his 
view on things. It’s just that at the 
end of the day I’m the one making 
the music and it’s sort of like it’s bet-
ter if I cut out all the extraneous stuff 
so it can become what it actually is. 
It’s just me on a stage presenting the 
things that I made as opposed to try-
ing to invent this larger idea of it that 
includes this other person’s very spe-

cific and very deliberate sensibilities. 
G: With the changes to the live 

show, do you think the music will fol-
low suit?

JB: I’m a big fan of the video 
games, and with the Final Fantasy 
series each installment of it is very 
different from the last one. There are 
little constant elements that make 
cameos, but in general, it’s a com-
pletely different self-contained world 
and self-contained story each time. 
Even when Josh was still around, 
when we were talking about the next 
thing, we both agreed that it should 
be different than the stuff before. 
Every time an Elite Gymnastics album 
comes out, it should be a very delib-
erately self-contained entity. Like all 
the Ruins stuff. There was a lot of 
continuity aesthetically and musically 
and lyrically. So the plan has been for 
a while that the next thing will be a 
clear break from that and a completely 
new self-contained set of sounds and 
emotional content. Josh leaving sort 
of draws a line under that even more 
forcefully. 

G: You told Pitchfork that you were 
interested in exploring more feminine 
influences on the next record. Could 
you elaborate a bit more on that?

JB: One of the reasons it was so 
hard for me to listen to pop music [as 
a kid] was just because the aggression 
of grunge rock and the stuff that was 
going on at the time really put me off. 
I’ve always been sort of uncomfort-
able around adult men — like extreme 
aggressive masculinity is kind of off 
putting to me. So when I started get-
ting into music a lot of the things that 
appealed to me the most were things 
like Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos and 
Fiona Apple and stuff.

B rooklyn Girl doesn’t pull too many tricks. The recently opened Mission Hills eatery

decor comes straight out of a New

Streisand dot the walls and mood 
lighting comes in the form of chan-
deliers inside birdcages. Wooden 
chairs are painted to resemble seats 
taken from a local public school. 
And while the food is good and the 
decor charming, it doesn’t distract 
from the fact that, on a Friday 
night, it is too loud to hear, well, 
anything. 

Given that the centerpiece of 
the restaurant is a bar, it is no 
wonder that their short cocktail 
menu has detailed offerings like the 
Back Pocket Mule and the Melon 
Manhattan (both $10). The Back 
Pocket Mule flips a traditional 
Moscow Mule on its head, blending 

Russian Standard Vodka, mashed 
strawberries, cucumber, agave 
syrup and ginger beer in a frosty 
metal mug. But because of the sheer 
amount of sugary additions to the 
cocktail, it lacks the kick it so badly 
needs. The Melon Manhattan is a 
much harsher drink, combining 
cantaloupe rye whiskey, carpano 
antica vermouth and angostura bit-
ters served on the rocks. 

If cocktails aren’t your thing, 
Brooklyn Girl boasts a decent selec-
tion of local draft and bottled beers 
in addition to a variety of specialty 
sodas made with seltzer water and 
artisan soda syrups imported from 
Brooklyn. 

For an interactive dining expe-
rience (or simply because the 
restaurant is fully booked — make 
reservations ahead of time), sit 
at the bar or at the two shared 
tables in the restaurant. Of course, 
their bar offerings are much more 
affordable than their dinner menu,

which features, among others, a $42 
stuffed lamb saddle. Instead, try the 
oyster sliders ($12), which comes 
in a set of three with a side of fresh 
salt and vinegar chips. Though the 
roll was more than slightly stale, the 
fried oysters were crunchy, sweet 
and briny. Paired with a tasteless 
but otherwise creamy coleslaw, the 
sliders were a perfect blend of sweet 
and creamy crunchiness that just 
worked well together. 

The recommended shrimp and 
chorizo ($12) is everything you 
would ever want from New York-
Southern cuisine. 
Shrimp and chorizo are 
sauteed with tomatoes 
and garlic, and sit atop 
a bed of slow-cooked 
masa grits so creamy 
and silky, you’ll never 
want to go back to any 
other starch again. 
The spicy oils from 
the chorizo give the 
grits a unique heat, 
and the salty queso 
fresco rounds out the 
standout dish of the 
night. The only mild 
disappointment with the dish is the 
over-saltiness of the shrimp, which 
was also dangerously on the under-
cooked side. But just the grits itself 

makes the dish well worth the order. 
With a dessert menu that boasts 

such offerings as bourbon bread 
pudding paired with bourbon 
ice cream ($6) and goat cheese 

cheesecake topped with a 
cherry brandy reduction 
($7), ordering a lemon 
blackberry pie inside of 
a jar ($7) seems like a 
vanilla option (no pun 
intended). But the lemon 
curd, which could have 
been off-puttingly sour, 
was surprisingly sweet 
— so sweet, in fact, that 
it was like eating black-
berry lemonade. The only 
problem with the des-
sert was that the graham 
cracker crust was so thin, 

it was quite nearly nonexistent. 
Though the rest of the menu 

is not college-affordable, students 
should stick to sitting at the com-
munal tables, though they are prone 
to oversharing and other diners 
looking lustfully at your food. At 
San Diego’s twice-annual Restaurant 
Week, Brooklyn Girl has a more 
affordable prix fixe menu.

can relax and enjoy the service — 
hence the name “lounge” — is exactly 
what the owner, Nick Totah, has been 
able to accomplish. He maximizes 
this overall experience with compli-
mentary drinks like juice, coffee and 
water — not to mention the classy 
glass of red or white wine. 

With rave reviews online and a 
history of being voted as the best 
hair salon in San Diego, Blend Hair 
Lounge ensures high-end experience 
and quality of work available for 
everyone. 

With accommodating hours of 

operation, it’s advisable to make 
appointments, but walk-ins are also 
welcome.

Eight professional hair stylists 
offer all kinds of hairstyles and ser-
vices that each customer is looking 
for, whether it is glamorous, chic, 
wild, sexy or edgy. 

Every hair stylist exhibits a 
friendly attitude, respecting each cus-
tomer’s opinion yet still guiding him 
or her to a better haircut and style. 

One of the greatest aspects of the 
salon is that even first-timers with-
out a designated hair stylist will not 
leave the salon unsatisfied due to the 
consistency of haircuts and services 

provided by every hair stylist. 
Haircut prices differ for men and 

women: Men’s cuts start at $30 and 
women’s cuts start at $55. Blend Hair 
Lounge also proudly boasts a large 
variety of hair coloring and many 
color specialists: Single-color dyes 
are $85 and partial highlights are 
$115. It’s not a cheap price for col-

but it’s worth every penny. Save up,

28th anniversary. But this is by no 
means your ordinary hair salon. 
It’s a place for the unconventional 
— dreadlocks, extensions, bright 
and crazy colors. And to add to its 
quirk, the entire space also serves 
as an art gallery, plastered with dis-
plays of various artworks, including 
folk and outsider art. 

“It’s not a place for mom to 
come,” salon owner Paul Bolton 

said. “It’s not old-fashioned, though 
some of us are old.”

Geared toward hip, trendsetting 
individuals, the salon has a clientele 
with an average age ranging from 
16 to 25 years old. 

Haircuts start at $40 and colors 
at $60, partial dyes costing $75 and 
full dyes costing $100. The salon is 
open Monday through Friday from 
9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday from 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Appointments 

aren’t required but can be made 
via phone (619-223-1112) or email 
(electricmusicstudios@gmail.com).

With an ample dose of edginess 
balanced out with bursts of vibran-
cy, the salon is sure to beckon and 
inspire the emergence of your free-
ly expressive self. It might be the 
time to take a chance — or rather, a 
seat — at The Electric Chair.

where we met 6’6” Michael, an American surfer 
and basketball player who encouraged us to go 
to strip clubs and was convinced that girls get 
‘wild’ when drunk because their testosterone 
levels increase. Ocean Beach offered late-night 
bonfires, a tramp with a guitar named Travis 
and screaming med students from Vegas turn-
ing 28. 

Both committed to having the full ‘American 
experience,’ we signed up to rush once we 
settled into UCSD. ‘Going Greek’ this week 
has involved a lot of girls flirting, chanting and 
competing. We now know just how the stereo-
type of the typical ‘so-rawr-ity’ girl has arisen.  
But please do not think we are judgemental, 
or judge us, for despite our cynicism we have 
become just as excited and involved as our 
potential ‘sisters.’ Lara has dreamt about sorori-
ties on two consecutive nights. We can’t help 
it; we are just as caught up in this hilarious and 
undeniably ridiculous social scene. 

For those males who haven’t experienced 
rush and want to pick up girls, take note. On 
the opening night of rush, there is a mile-long 
queue of girls outside Price Center, all dressed 
to impress, eagerly awaiting orientation. Once 
inside, we were all privileged enough to witness 
a fashion catwalk, illuminating the subtle, yet 
crucial differences between ‘casual,’ ‘dressy casu-
al’ and ‘formal’. For those in doubt, remember: 
A sblazer can redeem an outfit. 

Saturday and Sunday, we met the chapters 
for the first time. It was an overwhelming rush 
of singing, snapping and smiling. Despite the 
forced setting, being herded like cattle and 
repetitive questions, we begrudgingly admit we 
started to get a real sense of ‘sisterhood’ and 
exactly why these girls queue outside PC on 
a Friday night. We learnt about each chapter’s 
impressive philanthropic efforts — even if to the 
background music of “Call on Me.” Not only do 
these girls paint the nails of the elderly, but they 
also raise an immense amount of money each 
year for great and moving causes. 

On Monday, Mia was a little upset to find 
she wasn’t ‘dirty’ enough for Delta Gamma, and 
we both consoled ourselves with the fact that Pi 
Beta Phi didn’t seem to want any international 
students. Some girls were genuinely hysterical 
on realizing they had been dropped from their 
favorite chapters. 

We now hope that they have realized that 
each sorority is diverse and all have something 
genuine and positive to offer.  

Tonight, we are putting on our best blazers 
and eagerly await our fate. Will we have been 
dropped or not? You may well think us hysteri-
cal too if we receive a tank top with the wrong 
letters on Bid Day. This process has given us the 
chance to meet a lot of girls who do just want to 
have fun and, like us, desire a voice on campus. 

If only we could have witnessed our 
male counterparts experience with the frats!  
Hopefully we will be seeing them in togas soon. 

Unsure About Sororities, Sure About Togas

who takes the piano track “Openings” and simply 
plays it an octave lower. Nosaj Thing gave himself 
perhaps the biggest challenge, attacking “Knee 
1,” originally made up solely of vocal tracks of 
repeating numbers. On the remix, however, 
Nosaj adds a kick drum, a synth  and a barrage of 
other new instruments, relegating the numbers 
to the track’s periphery. And of course there’s 
Beck’s contribution, “NYC: 73-78,” a 20-minute 
odyssey made of minute-long snippets of differ-
ent Glass songs swoven into a cohesive whole.

The remixes on REWORK, though full of fin-
gerprints from their respective producers, main-

tain a reverence for Glass without slipping into 
obsequious prostration. More importantly, most 
of these tracks (with the exception of Memory 
Tapes’ disappointing effort) are Glassian — the 
sounds producing synesthetic visions of colors or 
shapes to create an experience very much akin to 
watching a film. “Etoile Polaire” suddenly shifts 
from ambient electronic wails to a scene from a 
delightful 80s cop show, so vivid you can basi-
cally smell the mustache wax. On the first track, 
“12 Parts-Part 1,” the steady bass, choppy vocal 
sample and plunky, frantic keyboard soundtrack 
some familiar solo night drive — streetlights 
blurring in the rain-drenched rearview. This one 
takes you places.

There was something so great 
about the ’90s, when those artists were 
operating and you had things like 
“Fast Car” by Tracy Chapman getting 
popular. It was very honest and very 
real. You compare that to what the 
female artists in pop music today are 
saying, and it’s just infinitely more 
sophisticated and healthier. I feel like 
something got lost with the role of the 
female singer songwriter. It fell out of 
fashion and people started to become 
ashamed of it. It got to the point 
where like that archetype… the Fiona 
Apple archetype of the girl who went 
to college and is mad at the establish-
ment — that sort of became a joke, 
like the Julia Stiles character in “10 
Things I Hate About You.” I miss pop 
culture putting forth the idea that the 
experience of being a woman in soci-
ety is something worth talking about. 
More than anything else, that’s the 
stuff that inspires me. It feels like what 
I want to be hearing from pop music. 

G: In what you’ve written on the 
Internet, you’ve sort of become the 
de facto ambassador to K-pop for the 
American indie scene. What drew you 
to that particular kind of pop music?

JB: One thing that I run into when 
I’m having conversations with people 
about this is that people are under the 
impression that I’m in favor of K-pop 
in opposition to pop music from other 
parts of the world. I think the reason 
why K-pop deserves to be paid atten-
tion to is that it’s just as good as any-
thing being made anywhere else in the 
world. There are things I appreciate 
about it that are unique that you can’t 
find anywhere else, but the main thing 
that I wanted to get across to people 
isn’t that they’re doing it better than 
the U.S.. What I wanted to get across 

was that this thing you might not be 
aware of is really cool. 

Because the platforms where I 
talked about it were Pitchfork and out-
lets that cover non-mainstream music 
it became a weird thing, because 
Pitchfork doesn’t cover Katy Perry, 
so why would they cover the Korean 
equivalent to Katy Perry? A lot of peo-
ple got confused by that. I genuinely 
like Katy Perry. I like Rihanna. I like 
Lana Del Rey. I might not like them as 
much as I like Fiona Apple and Tori 
Amos, but I think all of them make 
great music. 

G: And with “Gangnam Style” 
blowing up, you see K-pop finally 
reaching an international audience.

JB: “Gangnam Style” becom-
ing a hit is really a fulfillment of 
everything that I wanted when I 
was trying to evangelize K-pop to 
people. “Gangnam Style” is, if you go 
and find out what the lyrics mean, a 
critique of a specific cultural thing 
in South Korea. It’s like, PSY wasn’t 
trying to make something that 
Westerners would understand. He 
was saying something that was very 
specifically Korean, whereas other 
groups like Girls’ Generation are hir-
ing American producers and partner-
ing up with Will.i.am and trying as 
hard as possible to change themselves 
to appeal to an American audience. 
So the fact that the dude that actu-
ally broke through and got into the 
Billboard Top 10 and did it was this 
dude who was not even trying to — 
who was actually just trying to make 
something that was good — that’s 
like the ultimate fulfillment of every-
thing I could have hoped for with 
how K-pop entered the world stage. 
It’s so beautiful it makes me want to 
cry. I’m very happy that that’s how it 
ended up happening.

  THE UCSD GUARDIAN |   THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  11Arts & EntErtAinmEnt

P hilip Glass has spent the past 50 years writing symphonies, operas, musical theater, cham-
ber music and film scores. His stark 

minimalism and general avant-garde 
tendencies — a mixture of electronic, 
classical, and rock  — has been called 
controversial and oblique. But despite 
his antagonistic relationship with the 
casual listener, Glass is the preeminent 
composer of the last century. 

Which is all a long way of say-
ing that altering Glass’s work must 
be intimidating and that trying to 
improve on the work of the premier 
composer of the last century would 
take serious cajones. Beck, it seems, 
has very serious cajones. The singer/
songwriter/Glass-superfan spearhead-
ed REWORK_Philip Glass Remixed, 

a tribute album consisting solely of 
contemporary producers’ reimagina-
tions of Glass’s work. With Glass’s 
explicit approval, Beck coopted 11 
other producers to make remixes of 
Glass songs. Of course, “remix” has a 
loose interpretation, so there’s a vari-
ety of different kinds of reimagination 
happening here. Memory Tapes, for 
example, completely reinvents “Floe 
87” — only occasionally returning to 
Glass’ original melody and making 
the whole thing sound essentially like 
a Justice song. Then there’s Cornelius, 

D aphni, a side project of psych-pop auteur Dan Snaith, was formed with the purpose of 
applying the delicate pan-cultural 
sonic approach of Snaith’s main band, 
Caribou, to dance music’s broad 
palate. The existence of the Daphni 
project should come as no surprise 
to those who heard Caribou’s most 
recent album, Swim, which dabbled in 
the kind of dreamy house that paved 

the way for JIAOLONG’s more formal 
dance compositions.

The album is, for the most 
part, very successful: JIAOLONG’s 
nine tracks (which are apparently 
constructed mostly with a modu-
lar synthesizer designed by Snaith 
himself), contain exactly the kind of 
well-crafted, stylistically adventurous 
tunes one would expect from a musi-
cian of Snaith’s standing. Highlight 
“Ne Noya,” for example, combines 
an infectious sample of Togolese 
funk band Cos-Ber-Zam with a rigid 
techno pulse and shuffling hand 
percussion. Similarly, “Ye Ye” lays an 
insistent vocal sample (again, presum-
ably from one of the mid-’70s African 
pop records that provide inspiration 
for much of the album) over rippling 
synth arpeggios.

The most surprising aspect of 
JIAOLONG is the sense of restraint 

shown throughout. While Snaith’s 
work with Caribou tends toward max-
imalism, the songs on JIAOLONG are 
relentlessly lean in their composition. 
They often, as on tracks like “Light” 
and “Ahora,” consist of only two lay-
ers, a world-leaning melodic element 
and the kind of minimal rhythmic 
groove that betrays Snaith’s extensive 
knowledge of house and techno. This 
technique, while admirable, ultimately 
leads to the album’s primary flaw: 
Some of these tracks, while fascinat-
ing, don’t evolve enough over their 
runtime to maintain the listener’s 
interest. That fact notwithstanding, 
JIAOLONG’s highs, such as the gleeful 
“Yes I Know” are well worth the listen 
and prove that Snaith’s career in dance 
music is very promising indeed.

THe UCSd GUaRdian |  THURSdaY, OCTOBeR 11,  2012 |  www.UCSdGUaRdian.ORG 13

whether or not the students used 
the Crafts Center regularly, they 
all wanted the option. My tours 
questioned me about extracurricular 
activities, and I was always thrilled to 
tell them, as UCSC had (and still has) 
options for non-credit courses and 
workshops. I think UCSD severely 
underestimates the true interest 
students have for the Crafts Center. 
Just because the majority can’t fit it 
in to their busy coursework, doesn’t 
mean students were not interested in 
the Crafts Center.

I don’t know how UCSD plans to 
compete with the other UC schools 
for incoming freshman as budget 
cuts are destroying everything 
that made UCSD stand out from 
UCLA or Berkeley or UC Davis. All 
students need an outlet outside of 
class, and as you cut their options 
you will not only see an increase in 
dropouts but a severe decrease in 

interest from the potential freshmen. 
We know budget cuts have to happen 
somewhere, but as I walk around 
campus and see all of the expansion 
being funded in order to provide 
more money making opportunities 
for the campus, all I can think is 
that the traditional university ideals 
are dying; no longer is education 
being provided for education’s sake. 
I know it’s not entirely UCSD’s fault 
as they were forced to make cuts, but 
their options were numerous; they 
chose, rather, the easy route to close 
it abruptly. I see that they propose 
it shall be only closed for a year, but 
this is entirely contingent upon their 
expected costs, and at this point I 
do not trust that they have any real 
intention of working toward funding 
the program. It’s closed now and only 
time will tell if it will reopen, but 
anyone hoping to learn an artisan 
skill without having to commit to the 
intensity of a fine art major should

THE COUNTRY’S NEED.

According to the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), the 

US is facing an imminent physician shortage, specifi cally in primary care. 

Ross University School of Medicine (RUSM) is helping to meet this need by 

training physicians who are entering nearly every area of medicine, including 

the critical demand in pediatrics, internal medicine and family medicine. 

• RUSM provides clinical rotations at afﬁ liated teaching hospitals in the US.

• RUSM graduates have attained more US residencies annually than those 
of any other medical school in the world over the last fi ve years.

• RUSM is eligible to participate in the US Federal Direct Loan Program; 
fi nancial aid is available to those who qualify.

practices, including monitoring 
student org events for their suc-
cess so that those with the greatest 
impact across campus receive pri-
ority funding. The funding guide 
states that A.S. Council will fund 
events that fulfill at least one of 
the following criteria: reaches out 
to a wide audience of undergrad-
uate students, works to advance 
student interests, furthers wellness 
and well-being, encourages collabo-
ration amongst other on-campus 
organizations, educates positive 
learning outcomes, contributes to 
the community or develops leader-

ship and communication skills. 
Furthermore, a new policy of a 

tiered fund allocation system has 
been instituted based on averages 
of overall funding requests from the 
2011–12 academic year. This ranges 
from being able to request up to 
$150 for events that are expected to 
have 0 to 25 expected attendance, 
to $9,000 for those expected to 
have over 501 in attendance. These 
funding principles will promote the 
consistent apportionment of stu-
dent fees. 

While Cassella’s 10-year plan 
will help with future budgeting, the 
council also needs to work on being 
more stringent on the requirements 

for creating a student org. Applying 
for funding is not a difficult pro-
cess—in fact, it’s almost too easy. 
The requirements for receiving A.S. 
funds are simply that the princi-
pal members must all be under-
graduates and that the org must 
be registered with the Center for 
Student Involvement. The funding 
process can be done by any organi-
zation that claims to need money. 
In October 2010, UCSD students 
Utsav Gupta, Josh Grossman and 
Cody Marshall attempted to register 
89 illegitimate media organizations 
to detract funds from The Koala, 
and to make a point that council 
needs to reevaluate how it funds 

media organizations. 
Additional funds are granted 

to student orgs on a case-by-case 
basis, but sometimes these funds 
are over-allocated. In Spring 2010, 
the arts and fashion magazine No. 
15 was granted $15,000 from A.S. 
to print its debut issue. The finan-
cial repercussions of this are still 
felt today. 

Furthermore, the council needs 
to take a closer look at the number 
of student orgs that it allows on 
campus. According to the Center 
for Student Involvement, there are 
currently 342 undergraduate stu-
dent orgs registered for the 2012–13 
academic year. While part of hav-

ing a free and open campus is that 
everyone should be allowed to cre-
ate an organization, this freedom 
comes at the cost of taking away 
funds that other established orgs 
need. There are several different 
orgs in each org category, but hav-
ing many similar orgs may not be 
necessary.  More money could be 
allocated to each org if the rules 
for creating an organization were 
stricter.

The bottom line is, the 10-year 
plan is a step in the right direction, 
but A.S. Council needs to more 
closely monitor the activities of the 
orgs it finds to ensure that all the 
money is going to proper use.

Rules for Creating Student Orgs Need to be Stricter to Prevent Funding Spread Too Thin

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 15

start last Monday, Oct. 8, shooting 
a 300 in the first round and a 299 in 
the second round. 

UCSD improved in the second 
day of competition, shooting a 293 
for a final total of 892.

Sophomore Jay Lim led the 
Tritons with scores of 70, 74 and 72, 
for an overall score of 216, tying for 
sixth overall. 

Sophomore Jacob Williams fin-
ished second for UCSD with a score 
of 224, while junior Lewis Simon 
and freshman Clayton Yamaguchi 
both finished with a 226.

“Jay Lim played well as expected. 
It was a good start to the season 
with him finishing sixth,” Okasaki 
said. “Jacob Williams played well, 

he just had too many costly mistakes 
and looks good moving forward. 
Clayton Yamaguchi playing in his 
first tournament, showed decently 
but has much greater potential.”

Shooting in the fourth position 
for the Tritons was Marc Hermann, 
who contracted an allergic reac-
tion just prior to the tournament, 
according to Okasaki. 

Despite illness, Hermann fin-
ished the tournament with a 261.

The Tritons resume tournament 
play next week at the Sonoma State 
Invitational next week, Monday-
Tuesday, Oct. 15-16.

True freshman Cameron McElfresh 
logged his fourth game as a Triton, 
as well as his third shutout.

“Defense is something that we 
try to coach often and thorough-
ly,” UCSD Assistant Coach Eric 
Bucchere said. “I think the whole 
team has bought into attacking 
together and defending together. I 
think that’s made us a really diffi-
cult team to break down, and we’ve 
really become hard-nosed, honest 
hard-working squad.”

The Tritons have only allowed 
two goals in conference play, but are 
only averaging one goal a match. 
Bucchere concedes the Tritons may 
be lacking in the attack, but believes 
the goals will continue to come for 
UCSD.

“We haven’t been scoring a lot of 
the goals,” Bucchere said. “The con-

ference this year is especially tough, 
and all our games are going to be 
tight. But as the season progresses, 
we’re going to be scoring more and 
more goals.”

Nine games into conference play, 
the Tritons are currently 6-1-2, hav-
ing gone without a loss for six con-
secutive games. UCSD is just two 
points in front of CSU Dominguez 
Hills (6-4) and two points behind 
top of the South Division CSU Los 
Angeles (7-2-1).

The Tritons will face CSU Los 
Angeles this Friday, Oct. 12 at 
RIMAC Arena. The last time the 
two teams met, the Tritons dropped 
a decision in double overtime at the 
105th minute.

“[CSU Los Angeles] knows 
how to make the game difficult,” 
Bucchere said. “But the boys are 
focused on doing their jobs, com-
peting for the full game and break-

ing them down when they can.”
With only two teams from each 

division earning a bid to the con-
ference tournament, the Tritons 
need to hold onto second place, 
or take over CSU Los Angeles as 
Dominguez Hills and CSU San 
Bernardino try to jockey for posi-
tion. 

A win for the Tritons would put 
UCSD at the top of the table, while 
a tie would potentially endanger 
their second-place standing. 

“Every year we’ve been build-
ing,” Bucchere said. “I think the 
team really understands what it’s 
going to take to get to a post-sea-
son. They’ve all felt the heartbreak 
of coming close. This is an experi-
enced group that will be willing to 
fight.”

GOLF —The UCSD Golf team fin-
ished ninth out of 16 this weekend 
at the InterWest Insurance Wildcat 
Classic in Corning, Calif., even with 
one of their five men falling ill to an 
allergic reaction.

The Invitational featured teams 
from around the CCAA, including 
first place CSU Stanislaus, ranked 
No. 10 nationally, as well as second 
place CSU Monterey Bay. 

Three other conference oppo-
nents placed in front of the Tritons 
— fifth place Chico State, seventh 
place CSU East Bay and eighth place 
CSU San Bernardino.

“We’re much a better team than 
we showed this past tournament, 
considering we essentially compet-
ed with only four people,” UCSD 
Assistant Coach Keith Okasaki said. 
“I definitely expected much better 
and will continue to do so for the 
remainder of this Fall season.”

TRITONS IN FIGHT FOR 
FIRST PLACE

By RACHEL UDA
SPORTS EDITOR

In what’s become expected from the UCSD Men’s Soccer team, the Tritons won another low-scoring 
bout against Sonoma State last week, 
Friday, Oct. 4.

Played at Rohnert Park, the match 
featured two teams near the top 
of  their tables — with the Tritons 
in a fight for first in the CCAA 
South Division and the Seawolves 
neck-and-neck for first in the North 
Division with Chico State and CSU 
Stanislaus.

Just nine minutes into the match 

Sonoma put themselves 1-0 in the 
hole, as a Seawolf defender put the 
ball into his own net.

Junior forward Tsuk Haroush 
doubled the lead at the 30 minute 
mark, as his shot from within the 
18-yard box deflected off a Sonoma 
keeper and into the net.

From there, the-six person UCSD 
backline kept the Seawolves score-
less, allowing Sonoma only four shots 
— none of which were on target.

WOMEN’S SOCCER —Six games 
out from post-season play, and 
the UCSD Women’s Soccer team 
remains solidly at the top of the 
CCAA South Division.

Last Friday, Oct. 5, Rohnert Park 
played host to one of the most antici-
pated matches of the season, as the 
No. 17 Tritons faced off against No. 
13 Sonoma. The two teams battled to 
an anti-climatic 0-0 draw.

“I think we played a lot better 
than we had the weekend before,” 
senior midfielder Jessica Wi said. “It 
wasn’t our best game, but we knew 
we needed to step it up and we did.”

Despite the tie, UCSD keeps its 
distance from second-place CSU Los 
Angeles. The post-season race in the 
South Division has largely cooled, 
with CSU Los Angeles and CSU San 
Bernardino five and seven points 
behind first place, respectively.

Conversely, the draw brought 
Sonoma one game closer to CSU 
Stanislaus (7-1) — debatably the 
hottest team in the CCAA, having 
logged nine straight wins. 

On Sunday, Oct. 7, UCSD took a 
4-1 win from a Humboldt team that’s 
been banned in 2012 from partici-
pating as part of the conference due 
to an NCAA hazing infraction.

Senior defender Hayley Johnson 
scored two for the Tritons, both off 
free-kick opportunities from near 20 
yards out. The defender is UCSD’s 

third leading scorer with four goals, 
just behind Wi, with five, and sopho-
more midfielder Cassie Callahan, 
with six.

The Tritons are now 6-1-2 in 
conference, 8-1-2 overall.

UCSD will return to RIMAC 
Arena this Friday, Oct. 12. The 

Tritons will host CSU Los Angeles at 
7:00 p.m. The following Sunday, the 
Tritons head back on the road to face 
CSU Dominguez Hills.

“Against [CSU Los Angeles] we 
want to build on everything we’ve 
been working on this season and 
play to the team’s full potential,” Wi 

said. “It’s always a competitive game 
against [CSU Los Angeles], we just 
want to go out and prove that we’re 
one of the best, if not the best team 
in the conference.”
