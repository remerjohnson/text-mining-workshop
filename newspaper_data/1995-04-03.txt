SACRAMENTO - San 
Bernardino Valley College 
student Janice Camerena has 
named UC President Jack 
Peltason as one of several 
defendants in an anti-affirma-
tive action suit filed on March 
16. Camerena, a Caucasian, 
claims she-was asked to leave 
an English 101 class because 
she was told it was intended 
for black students ouly. The 
suit opposes the community 
colleges' Black Bridge 
Project, designed to help 
African Americans succeed in 
college. Peltason has been 
named in the suit because the 
UC President's Office 
administers a similar program 
geared towards Hispanics, the 
Puente Project.

'Killer Bee.' In 
Imperial County 
IMPERIAL COUNTY -
Africanized honey bees were 
discovered in an Imperial 
County school yard last week, 
the second such discovery 
within California's borders in 
the last six months. Though 
the swarm was destroyed 
without incident, the bees are 
considered very dangerous. 
Two human fatalities in the 
United States have been 
attributed to the "killer bees" 
since their escape from a 
Brazilian laboratory in 1957. 
The swarms have been slowly 
migrating north and are 
beginning to surface in Texas, 
Arizona and California.

Professional School Fee Hike Approved 
REGENTS: Medical 
school costs set to 
jump $2,000 annually 

The widely anticipated fee hikes, 
which were endorsed during a re-
gents committee meeting the previ-
ous day, will only affect new stu-
dents entering UC professional pro-
grams beginning in the fall of 1995. 
New law and business students will 
pay an additional $2,000 per year, 
while new medical, dental and vet-
erinarian students will pay an addi-
tional $1,000. Law and medical stu-
dents will have to pay an extra $376 
in special degree fees. 

for medicine, $7,670 for dentistry, 
$7,733 for veterinary medicine, 
$9,157 for law and $8,949 for busi-
ness (except at UC Riverside, which 
will charge $7,949). 

Young pointed out that one-third of 
the increases will go toward finan-
cial aid. 

"The cost is going up, but the 
amount of aid is going up," Young 
said. "It will raise fees, but more 
will be put into financ ial aid, so we 
will be providing a discount." 

By DCKC Alexander 
Senior Staff Writer 

Speaking at the March 16 meet-
ing, UCLA Chancellor Charles 
Young threw his support behind the 
fee hikes. "This is necessary. It's 
absolutely essential to maintain the 
quality of professional schools in-
volved," Young said. 

In a move which will cost new 
professional-school students as 
much as $2,000 per year, the UC 
Board of Regents approved fee in-
creases for the university's schools 
of law, business, medicine, dentistry 
and veterinarian medicine at its 
March 17 meeting at UCLA. 

The fee increases will push an-
nual fees for new students to $8,331 

In an attempt to quell fears that 
the increases will block students 
from attending professional schools, 

According to UC Provost Walter 
Massey, the Regent's Committee 
on Finance found that the 1994-95 
fee increases did not have a nega-
tive impact on the number of appli-
cants or students enrolling UC pro-

Professor's Library Walk Injunction 
Shot Down By California High Court 
CONTROVERSY: 250 trees fall 
as construction begins on $2.5 
million pathway 
By Franclaco DeV ..... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite a flurry oflast-minute legal challenges, 
over 250 mature cucalyptus trees wc~e cut down 
last week to make way for the controversial "li-
brary Walk." Construction of the $2.5 million 
pathway is scheduled to be completed in Septem-
ber. 

Lawyers for UCSD Physics Professor Jorge 
Hirsch, who petitioned the court to block the 
cutting of the trees, fought the construction all the 
way to the California Supreme Court in the final 
days before construction began. 

"I feel very strongly that the university did 
something wrong here ... ," Hirsch said lut week. 

"I'm obviously very disappointed that we didn't 
get an injunction.'" 

University administrators maintain that they 
followed proper procedures throughout the plan-
ning for Library Walk. 

"Thc court found that ... we had prepared the 
appropriate documentation as required by state 
law," said Assistant Director of Campus Planning 
Marilyn Cox. 

The court challengc centered on the possible 
environmental impact of cuning down thc trees. 
The university did not complete a separate Envi-
ronmental Impact Report (ElR) for the construc-
tion project, instead relying on a Final Environ-
mental Impact Statement for the "Long Ringe 
Development Plan" completed in 1989. 

Hirsch's attorney, Tom Penfield, said that li-
brary Walk wu not specifically covered in the old 
environmental review and that the possible envi-

UCRegents 
Discuss Future 
Of Aflinnative 
Action 
MEmNG: Nearly 200 
demonstrators rally in favor 
of university programs 
By Doua Alexander 
Senior Staff Writer 

Facing an estimated 200 protesters, the 
UC Board of Regents once again tackled the 
issue of affirmative action, hearing testi-
mony on the university's race-attentive poli-
cies at its March 16 UCLA meeting. 

Rallying outside the meeting, the pro-
testors called for the continuation of the 
university'S affirmative-action programs, 
which are being threatened by legislation 
aiming to abolish racial and gender prefer-
ence. 

"I think we need to expose the facts and 
not the myths [about affirmative action]," 
said UCSD sophomore Gabriella Juarez at 
the protest. "I was not admitted because of 
affirmative action. We're scapegoats for 
everything. " 

Fearing disruptive demonstrations, 
UCLA officials assigned 75 police officers 
- the campus' entire force, plus 40 officers 
from six different campuses - to cover the 
meeting. The protest, however, went with-
out incident. 

At the meeting, outgoing UC President 
Jack Peltason, who was named as a co- -
defendant in a community college reverse-
discrimination suit the same day, cxtolled 
the principle of diversity and reaffirmed his 
support for university affirmative-action an,d 
minority-outreach programs. 

"In my judgment... our equal-opportu-
nity, affirmative-action and diversity pro-
grams have been indispensable, both to our 
educational mission and to our ability to 
achieve a diversified community of learn-
ing," Peltason said. 

However, noting the legal and legislative 
challenges to affirmative action, he con-
ceded the university will be reviewing pro-
grams to determine whether some need modi-
fication to "ensure fairness." 

"If some do require changing, we are 
prepared to change them," Pcltason said. 

However, Peltason credited programs

plans to continue fight 
ContInued from .... 1. 
ronmental damage had not been in-
vestigated properly. 

In Hirsch's petition to the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court, which was 
filed the morning construction be-
gan, the justices were asked to "pro-
hibit [the university] from destroy-
ing 268 mature eucalyptus trees, in 
two groves, ... without first usess-
ing the environmental consequences 
of such an action. .. 

The courts ruled, however, that 
the statute of limitations on chal-
lenges to the environmental review 
for Library Walk had expired and 
that the less-intensive review pro-
cess used by the university was ad-
equate. 

"We actually do a little more 
public review than is required," Cox 
said. 

After initially granting a tempo-
rary restraini ng order prohibi ti ng the 
university from cutting the trees on 
March 16, San Diego Superior Court 
Judge Robert C. Baxley refused to 

DIVERSrrv: 
Legislation jeopardizes 
affirmative action 
ContInued froni PIC. 1. 
Program (EOP) for increasing the 
diversity of students and faculty at 
the UC. "Whatever progress we have 
made is due in large measure to 
deliberate efforts, overthe past three 
decades, to see that the university is 
open to Californians from every 
background," he said. 

Following Peltason's address, 
several officials spoke on the 
university 's affirmative-action and 
outreach programs. 

At the regents' meeting in Feb-
ruary, Regent Ward Connerly, who 
has come out against affirmative 
action, asked university officials to 
prepare a report on minority admis-
sions policies to the board. Connerly 
did not attend the March 16 meet-
ing, however. 

In his presentation to the regents, 
UC Assistant Vice President Den-
nis Galligani said that low eligibil-
ity rates among minorities is a "fun-
damental problem" and defended 
university academic-developme1l't 
programs, saying they have been 
successful in helping minority high 
school students get into college. 

While the Master Plan mandates 
that the UC accept the top 12.5 per-
cent of California's high school 
graduates, only four percent of 

issue an injunction following a for-
mal court hearing on March 22. 

Hinch and his lawyer appealed 
the decision, but the Court of Ap-
peal "turned us down in a couple of 
hours," according to Penfield. 

A final appeal was made: to the 
California Supreme Court on March 
22; even as crews began to remove 
trees on campus. The appeal was 
denied, although one justice sided 
with Hirsch. 

Hirsch, who personally paid for 
all the legal work, is now serving as 
his own attorney. He said last week 
that, while Library Walk will be 
built, he plans to work to improve 
the campus review process. 

"In the end, [administrators] do 
what they want to do and there never 
is any real input .. . ," he said. "There 
is not much real input in any of these 
formal committees that exist," he 
added. 

However, Cox said Library Walk 
was discussed in 185 different cam-
pus meetings and had been part of 
campus plans since 1966. Hirsch's 
claim that Library WaJkdid not have 
an adequate review "is just unsub-
stantiated," she added. 

Latino and five percent of Mrican-
American high school students are 
currently eligible for UC admissions. 
However, when enrolled in special 
academic-preparation programs, 40 
percent of these students meet the 
eligibility requirements, according 
to Galligani. 

Regent David Flinn praised such 
outreach programs as "enormously 
successful," but warned that they 
are threatened by impending anti-
affirmative-action legislation. 

"I believe this university is going 
to find that it needs to speak up 
about the preservation of our ability 
to use these programs," Flinn added. 

Legislation such as the Califor-
nia Civil Rights Initiative, which 
backers are hoping to put on the 
1996 ballot, would mandate the uni-
versity to not only eliminate affir-
mative action, but a number minor-
ity-specific education and outreach 
programs. 

"I believe there is a need for 
change and tbechange needs to came 
from the K-12 system. There has to 
be a cooperative effort," said Re-
gent Tirso del Junco said. 

However, Regent Roy Brophy said 
the university should not be involved 
directly in secondary-school educa-
tion. "We have no reason to take our 
bodies and faculty to K-l2 schools, 
but we need to train our teachers to 
train our students," he said.

Forum to Advocate Marijuana's Merits 
The 1995 Medical Marijuana Forum will be held at 

UCSD Tues. April 4, featuri~ several speakers who 
will address the medical merits of matluana use in 
treatments for cancer, AIDS and other illnesses. 
Sponsored by the National Organization for the Reform 
of Marijuana Laws (NORML), Tuesday's free discus-
sion will be held in Solis Hall Room 107 from 6:00 p.m. 
to 10:00 p.m. 

NORML seeks to allow the legal use of marijuana 
for medical purposes. The forum will discuss the laws 
which prevent obtaining marijuana to fight Illnesses. 

Six speakers, Including california NORML Chair 
Dennis Peron, and ·Brownle Mary· Rathbun will be 
featured. Rathbun, a 71')'ear~ld grandmother, be-
came famous after her arrest for bak_ cannabis 
brownies for AIDS patients.

Education Heavyweights to 
Addr_ Financial Aid Cuts 

five education leaders seek to make students and the 
community more aware of the ramifications of such a 
lar&e cut In financial aid. 

The bulk of the proposed cutbacks arise from the 
elimination of federally subsidized loans. The cove~ 
ment pays the interest on subsidized loans while the 
student attends school. Upon eraduation, the lender 
would only pay back the original principle borrowed: 

The United States Student Association estimates 
that the elimination of Subsidized Stafford Loans 
could Increase college costs by as much as 25 percent 
for undellr8duates and by as much as 50 percent for 
&racIuate students.

Students will live on campus, attend classes In 
marine biology and environmental science and go on 
various field trips.

at 2:30 p.m., at the University of San Diego's Hahn 
University Center, to discuss the proposed $20 billion 
cut In financial aid over the next five years. 

UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson will speak at 
the conference along with San Diego State University 
President Thomas Day, San Diego Community College 
District Chancellor Augustine Gallego, University of 
San Diego PreSident Author Hughes, and San Marcos 
State University President Bill Stacy. 

Marine biology studies will focus on the natural

FEES:

fessional schools. 

"We will be reviewing [the plan] 
every year to see if the increases are 
having an adverse effect on enroll-
ment," Musey said. 

However, U. Gov. Gray Davis, 
who sits on the Board of Regents, 
opposed the fee hikes and expressed 
concern that they will bar students 
from the university'S professional 
programs. 

"At some point, these fees will 
start excluding some students," 
Davis said. "At some point, the pro-
cess becomes self-defeating." 

At UCSD, reaction to the fee 
hikes was mixed. 

UCSD School of Medicine As-
sociate Dean of Admissions Charles 
Spooner said he does not anticipate 
thai the $1,376 fee hike will effect 
student admissions. 

"We're simply overwhelmed 
with students," Spooner said, add-
ing that UC medical schools have 
shown record growth in the last sev-
eral years, despite previous fee in-
creases. The VC's medical schools, 
Spooner said, are still much cheaper 
than comparative public institutions. 

However, UCSD School of 
Medicine Student Financial Services 
Officer Carol Hartupee said such 
fee increases could have a negative 

. effect on the university in the long 
run. She said the increasingly high 
debt bu rden necessary to attend 
medical school could keep students 
from entenng medicine. 

"At some point, it gets past a 
certain level and becomes unman-
ageable," she said.

Give Patients Medicinal 
Marijuana - Legally 

Bob Randell, 48, is one of eight people in the United States 
who can legally smoke pot. Diagnosed with glaucoma in tbe 
1970s, doctors told him that the disease was progressing so 
rapidly tbat he would soon go blind. Then, by cbance, he found 
tbat smoking marijuana - six to 12 joints per day - made him 
feel better and baited the deterioration of his vision. 

After being arrested for possession of marijuana in 1975, 
Randall successfully argued that his medical condition 
necessitated using the drug. Randall's landmark case paved the 
way for others, who suffered from diseases ranging from cancer 
to leukemia, to receive government-supplied buds under tbe 
Compassionate Use Investigational New Drug program. 

Then AIDS struck. And as the number of people applying for 
medicinal marijuana skyrocketed, the Busb Administration barred 
new applicants from entering the program. Since 1992, the 
government has denied AIDS patients, and others afflicted with 
deadly and debilitating diseases, legal use of marijuana to help 
alleviate their symptoms. 

Fed on drug-war hysteria and the "Reefer Madness" 
propaganda of yesteryear, proponents of these cruel and outdated 
laws fear allowing patients to use pot would encourage 
recreational drug use. In addition, they claim that there simply 
isn't enough evidence showing the benefits of medicinal 
m'arijuana. Both claims are bogus. 

As Rick Doblin, the executive director of th~ 
Multidisciplinary ASsociation for Psychedelic Studies in North 
Carolina, has pointed out, gelling federal approval for marijuana 
research is el(tremely difficult. "They can ' t approve medical use 
of marijuana' beca~se there isn't enough researc.h, but then they 
aren't permitting the research," Doblin has said. UC San 
Francisco AIDS researcher Donald Abrams, for el(ample, has 
spent three years trying to gain federal approval to conduct a 
clinical study to determine whether smoking pot helps patients 
overcome the "wasting syndrome" associated with AIDS. 

Marijuana is widely reported to alleviate nausea from 
chemotherapy, ease muscle spasms in paralyzed people, reverse 
the AIDS wasting syndrome and help diminish vision loss from 
glaucoma. A Harvard University study found that more than 40 
percent of cancer specialists have advised chemotherapy patients 
to smoke pot. 

With the advent of AIDS, the need for medicinal marijuana has 
become more urgent, fostering growing dissent to federal medical 
marijuana laws. In its refusal to enforce these laws, San Francisco 
has become the hotbed of the medicinal-hemp movement. 

"I have no problem whatsoever with the use of marijuana for 
medical purposes," said Mayor and former Police Chief Frank 
Jordan. "I am sensitive and compassionate to people who have 
legitimate needs. We should bend the law and do what's right." 

Given the city ' s principled stance. the Cannabis Buyers' 
Club, a nonprofit organization which has been distributing 
marijuana since 1991, has given patients with legitimate needs an 
alternative to buying on the street. As Buyers' Club Founder and 
long-time gay activist Dennis Peron has said, "These people are 
struggling to live, and marijuana is helping them live." 

Peron is currently pushing to get an initiative which would 
legalize medical marijuana use on the 1996 California ballot. 

Those with terminal and debilitating diseases deserve any 
form of medicine which alleviates the symptoms of their 
condition. If marijuana works, then there is no legitimate reason 
to continue tbis country's ridiculous ban on pot. 

Thumbs Up to 
Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson ••• 

... who will participate in "An Alliance to Save Student Aid," a 
joint press conference at the which will serve to protest Congress' 
proposal to cut $20 billion worth of federal student fina~cial aid 
over the next five years. 

Atkinson, as well as chancellors and representatives of other 
San Diego colleges, will meet and discuss the possible results of 
these cuts with students and the community. 

Students and educators must ensure that the student and the 
university system does not become a victim of the GOP measures 
whicb seek to help the taxpayer by burting education.

skills. I spent 
the first 
weekend of 
spring break 
in my apart-
ment grading 
final exams 
and papers 
for my reader 
job. So, I feel 
I should 
share what I 

have learned from this experience. The 
most important thing 1 have learned is 
that it's much easier to grade when 
you're eating Ben and Jerry's Super 
Dark Chocolate ice cream. Aside from 
this, here are some tips to satisfy dis-
cerning readers and TAs such as myself. 

1. USE TERRIBLE HANDWRIT-
ING. No one really cares wbat you 
write anyway. And if it's actually leg-
ible, we'll be able to read it and will 
probably shoot holes through your ar-
gument, lowering your grade as a re-
sult. Graders like an exam that is a 
chicken-scratched, ink-blotted mess, 
because then, as we're grading them in 
the library, and our friends walk up and 
ask what we're doing. we can poinl'and 
say, "look at this" as their ~yes widen 
in horror at our arduous task. 

2. IGNORE THE QUESTION. If 
you're taking a history class and the 
exam question asks you to el(plain 
Brunhilde Ostenwest's position on 
German reunification, just write a his-
tory of the world and mention Ger-
many a few times. There's no need to

pesky "it's/its" dilemma - who do you 
think we are - rocket scientists? Dic-
tionaries are always too far away, and 
that spell-check function on computers 
is way too much of a pain. 

4. USE TERRIBLE GRAMMAR. 
Good writing, like good spelling, is 
overrated. We have far too many impor-
tant things to worry about without add-
ing trivialities like verb tense to our list 
of concerns. To get in the spirit of this 
revolution, I threw lots of errors into this 
column, but those old fusspot GUQrd-
ian editors kept removing them. Some 
people really have skewed values. 

5. ABBREVIATE EVERYTHING. 
Graders know how valuable your time 
is while you're writing a bluebook 
exam. We understand that to cram as 
many buzzwords as possible into your 
prose, you must write speedily. Abbre-
viating everything really helps, espe-
cially when you use little symbols. 
There's nothing like the persuasive, 
flowing prose of a sentence such as, 
"The Aing status of U.S. wmn. @ the 
wkplce, ocly Aed mUml. relations in 
the late 20th C, cuz N#& TIll A was most 
certainly tOOt«." Graders enjoy read-
ing hieroglyphics such as this because 
it's fun to stare at a sentence Jor 15 
minutes, trying to figure out what the 
author could possibly mean. Sure, it 
makes exams more difficult to grade, 
keeping us up later into the wee hours 
of dawn - but I'm happy to sacrifice 
a few hours of sleep to the joy of read-
ing such graceful prose. 

actually address the specific question, especially since 
it will only result in the embarrassing revelation that 
you never read Ostenwest's article. Your grader would 
ratber not sec you humiliate yourself. . 

6. MAKE UP STUFF. Regurgitating 
facts is no indicator of true wisdom. Students are com-
pletely justified in asserting that simply reciting names 
and dates proves nothing about what they've learned. 
Unless, of course, you write things such as, "after the

QPlNlON S 

ADMINISTRATION IS AVOIDING STUDENT INPUT ON 'WALK' 
EdItor: 

I feel it is el(tremely important to 
clarify tbe focus of the activism 
against tbe implementation of the 
Library Walk. On March 13 and 14, 
a group of concerned students, in-
cluding myself, discussed the project 
witb Chancellor Ricbard Atkinson, 
Assistltll" Vice Chancellor Boone 
Hellmann and a number of other ad-
ministrators. Hellmann and Atkinson 
made it clear that the signatures of 
over 1500 students, collected in only 
two-and-a-balf days, would have no 
impact on the start date of the 
project. Even though both Hellmann 
and Atkinson told us that they had 
the power to delay tbe projcct until 
a referendum was held on the A.S. 
ballot in April, they refused to do so. 

These administrators flagrantly 
lied to us. Atkinson claimed that 
"every effort" was made to ensure 
that students knew about this 
project. He said that he couldn't 
understand why we claimed that few 
people had heard of the projcct un-
til a week before ground was bro-
ken. "Every effort" could be more 
accurately characterized as a mini-
mal and tardy effort. Furthermore, 
the construction was deliberately 
scheduled to begin in the middle of 
finals week and to continue into 
Spring Break, making it difficult for 
students to organize. The reason for 
this weak effort is clear: In admin-
istration documents, the public-re-
lations difficulty which the Library 
Walk would present was repeatedly 
emphasized, and every effort was 
made to "spin" facts into a positive 
light when they could not be hid-
den or obscured. 

Atkinson became agitated when 
we claimed that student input was 
minimal and inadequate. He repeat-
edly called us liars and cut us off. 
Yet, the administration's own docu-
ments show that only 25 students 
have been involved since 1988 in 
the "public planning process," and 
13 of those were involved only in 
"discussions" and "briefings" about 
the Master Plan as a whole. Even 
when input was solicited, students 
did not have proportional represen-
tation on committees. Many of these 
students graduated years ago, when 
the university was considerably 
more affordable. Finally, all the in-
volved students were appointed by 
the A.S. or GSA, organizations -
made up of university employees-
which historically rubber-stamp 
university policy. 

Boone Hellmann engaged in sev-
eral convincing attempts to uplain 
the technical necessity of this 
project. However, we later found 
that much of what he said was sim-
ply a fairy tale. Hellmann made up 
claims about the need for a drainage 
system which have been refuted by 
the civil-engineering firm which 
studied the issue for the administra-
tion. Hellmann also made claims 
about the unhealthy nature of the 
trees; these claims were refuted by 
the Davy Resource Group, which 
studied the health of the eucalyptus 
trees for the administration. While 
drainage problems will occur and 
trees will have to be removed if li-
brary Walk is built, these are not pre-
existing problems which the walk-
way (and associated infrastructure) 
will solve.

Hellmann did present a variety of 
good reasons why Library Walk, in 
some form, should be constructed. 
These centered around pedestrian 
traffic and handicapped-access con-
cerns. He also told us that these func-
tional considerations could have been 
adequately addressed for $1 million 
less, but that aesthetics were deemed 
important to attract students and fac-
ulty to the university and to visually 
orient and lead people into the uni-
versity core (the Price Center area). 

Our position is simply that if the 
administration thinks this is such a 
great project, it should have noth-
ing to fear from pUlling it to a vote 
of those whom it will most impact 
- the students. Reasonable, demo-
cratic student input never occurred. 

Instead, the administration claimed 
to act in our best interests while 
clearly doing the exact opposite. 
This paternalism is unacceptable 
and shows a fundamental lack of 
respect for the student body.

No DIIcretIon In Use of 
DI....uon., Funds 
Editor: 

I read that Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson is using $2.5 million from 

• his discretionary budget on a walk-
way leading from UCSD's Central 
Library to a classroom building 
("Care For a Walk?" March 13). 
According to Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor of Facilities Design and Con-
struction Boone Hel1mann, "(the 
discretionary funds] have absolutely 
nothing to do, and this is a part I 
want to emphasize, with student 
fees in any form or fashion .... 

So, if not from student fees, how 
does one come up with $2.5 million 
to spend at one's discretion? Here 
are a few methods: 

• Require 100 UCSD employees 
making $50,000 per year to donate 
half of their salaries to show their 
gratitude. 

• Send 15,000 UCSD students 
into San Diego to find jobs which 
pay $8 per hour (after taxes). Have 
them each work 20 hours and do-
nate the proceeds. In return, engrave 
their names on the walkway. 

• Ask every resident of San Di-
ego to donate a dollar to the "Golden 
Brick Road" at UCSD. (Of course, 
to walk on it, one would have to pay 
another dollar to park one's car long 

enough to do so.) 
• Ask California taxpayers, under 

the auspices of funding education,to 
work diligently and send their dol-
lars to the federal and state officials 
who dole it out. Have them put $2.5 
million into a discretionary fund. 

Nobody said the chancellor 
wasn't a bright man, only that he 
shows an incredible lack of judg-
ment, or "discretion" rather, in 
spending other people's money -
money which should be used for edu· 
cation or student development.

The incident occurred at the

which proves you've learned noth-

they're so busy savoring your prose. 

they know. If your paper is too short, 
go ahead and try something really 
surreptitious like using a 2O-point 
font and two-inch margins. While 
reading the paper, we will undoubt-
edly be so awestruck by your

IMPLORING COMMENTS AT

ter reading a "C-" exam, graders are 
touched by seeing a heartfelt plea 
scribbled at the end. Something like, 
" I just didn't have enough time to 
finisb tbis," or "I would have worked 
on my paper more, but my goldfish 
was undergoing kenotherapy [sic]

Making up words serves I strate-
gic purpose. Upon reading creations

"spurbrionic," TAs will simply give 
up. Because TAs can't officially say 
these creations are not real.words in-
cluded in Webster's (unless they ac-

they'll give you the benefit of the 
doubt, and you might have diverted 
them from your weak argument.

fact that T As -let alone professors 
- have been in school for the last

ams and studying are probably all 

Brown-nosing warms our bearts, 
too. "Professor Jurisprudence, I re-
ally enjoyed your. class and I learned 
alot [sic) (see *3), and I just can't 
wait to take your class next quarter." 
Any TA who reads this will suddenly 
smile warmly, say "Awwww" and 
give you an A- instead of a C+. Af-
ter all, you deserve it.

Monday, April 3, t995 

Chuck NeuYen/GuMII." 

The UCSD Guardiu 

CREW: Women 
Advance to Finals 
ContInued from INC. 20 
Anteaters on Saturday. And again 
UCSD prevailed, nipping Irvine 
by less than a second. 

The next morning, the two col-
lided once more in the Cal Cup Fi-
nal. The Tritons took the lead at 
the I,OOO-meter mark, but UCSD 
couldn't shake Irvine. Grabbing a 
second wind, the Anteaters pow-
ered past the Tritons to take the 
victory, and the UCSD crew 
settled for the silver medal. 

Ed Ruth Nmed AJI-AmerIc .... honorable mention In row .vema. The Triton rowers got their re-
venge later that afternoon. Row-
ing in the Cal-VISitors' Cup, which 
featured the top three teams from 
both the Cal and Visitors' Cup 
races, UCSD got off to an excel-
lent start. 

SWIM: Tritons 
Take Thirteenth 
Continued from .,... 20 
Adam Burgasser became an All· 
American by taking home fourth on 
the one-meter board. Teammate 
Josh Curtiss, competing in his last 
NCAA meet, captured an honorable 
mention for his 15th.place finish. 

After the opening day, however, 
the Tritons had decidedly less to 
cheer about as their youth and lack 
of depth hindered them. Among the 
standouts who earned honorable 
mentions for UCSD were Ed Ruth 
in the 4OO-yard individual medley 

(lOth) and the 2oo-yard breast-
stroke (15th), and Andy Holly-
wood in the tOO-yard backstroke 
(16th). Burgasser came up just 
short of All-American in the three-
meter, settling for an honorable 
mention and ninth.place. 

A number of relay teams also 
earned honorable mentions: The 
SOO-yard freestyle relay team of 
Jefferson, O'Conner, Parkinson 
and McAteer stormed to a 10th 
and then teamed up again in the 
400-yard freestyle relay to snare 
14th. The ZOO·yard medley squad 
of Hollywood, Ruth, Jefferson and 
Gavin Bishop took home 11th to 
round out the honors for UCSD. 

The Tritons kept working until 
they knifed through the finish line 
in second place with a time of 
6:24.55, trailing only Oregon 
State. They also handily disposing 
offourth-place Irvine by three sec-
onds. 

" It was an outstanding showing 
for the team, and I'm extremely 
proud. This was tough competition 
and to hold on like we did, I 
couldn't be happier," UCSD Nov-
ice Coach Emily Ford said.

Tritons in 
Orlando: Fun 
In the Sun 
PHENOM: Frosh 
Lindsay Harris pitches 
two one-hit wins 
aySunR ....... 
Stsff Writer 

It was lots of sun and sandy 
beaches. It was spring break in a 
beautiful setting. And did the Tri· 

tons get distracted 
by all the scenery 
around them? 

Definitely not. 
The UCSD soft-

ball team came out 
to play, and it 
showed on the 
field . The Tritons 
came away with 

four victories in eight games in the 
Spring Rebel Tournament in Or-
lando, FL. 

The Triton sluggers split two 
games on March 30 and March 31 
on the way to improving their record 
to 6-14. UCSD looked to extend a 
two-game winning streak. 

In the first set of contests, UCSD 
defeated Trinity University, 10-3, 
and lost to the University of Wis-
consin at Whitewater, 4-3. In the 
opening game, freshman Lindsay 
Harris pitched a one-hitter to pick 
up her first win of the season. 

The Tiger batters were overpow-
ered by Harris, as she gunned each 
foe down, one by one. Kristy 
Schilling, Lisa Gil and Kristen 
Schueller each picked up two hits, 
and the Tritons pounded the Tigers. 

In the nightcap, the Warhawksof 
UWW came back to defeat the Tri-
tons, scoring one run in the seventh 
and two in the bottom of the eighth 
to squeak by 4-3. UCSD's standout 
pitchcr, Gil, scattered four hits, but 
she was hurt by three walks and a 
wild pitch in the seventh inning. 

In the last doubleheader of the 
tourney, UCSD split the twin-bill : 
crushing University of Taylor, 8-0, 
and losing to Weber College, 5-0. 

Once again Harris was the star, 
pitching a one-hit shutout for her 
second win of the weekend. The 
lone hit for the Lady Trojans was a 
weak ground ball that slipped past 
Triton shortstop Nora Stephany. 

In the second game, Weber Col-
lege was too much for the Tritons, 
shutting them out, 5-0. 

FENCERS: 
Take 23rd at NCAAs 
Continued from pa,e 20 

She posted a 3-3 record to earn a 
place among the 24 fencers in the 
finals. Teammate Yumi Nishiyama 
was unfortunately unable to reach 
the finals in the hotly contested foil 
discipline - she finished the pre-
liminary round in the 29th position. 

In the round-robin finals on Sun-
day, Wertz shone, successfully du-
eling Division ( foes to take home a 
ninth-place finish. Her performance 
was good enough for All-American 
honorable mention. 

On the men's side, Hal Aljibury 
finished a mere two positions out of 
the finals with a 26th-place mark-

UCSD Goes Two for Four 
DOUBLED UP: Tritons fall to Cal Lu after going 2-0 earlier in the week 
ByS .. nRMlml 
Staff Writer 

Revenge was the reason the 
Regals of Cal Lutheran University 
came to La Jolla. They succeeded

lIt ~ 
BHLr 

in their mission, 
sweeping a 
doubleheader 
from the Triton 
baseball team 
over the break, 4-
1 and 5-4. 

Earlier in the 
week, the Tritons 
had won two 
games against 

Concordia and Westmont. However, 
in the opening game of the twin-bill 
against Cal Lu, UCSD's batters 

were shut down by Regal pitcher 
Carlos Garibay (5-0). Garibay scat-
tered seven hits to earn his fifth win 
of the season, and Cal Lutheran (15-
7) won easily, 4-1. 

The lone Triton score came in the 
bottom of the seventh inning, when 
AI DelFavero crushed a solo home 
run, his second dinger of the year, 
to cutthe lead to 4-1. UCSD's Steve 
Height (4-3) pitched well, but took 
the loss behind a stagnant Triton 
offense. 

In the nightcap, the Triton slug-
gers went to extra innings, but came 
away empty again, 5-4. 

Ryan Ward started the game for 
the Tritons and pitched a solid game, 
giving up three runs in eight innings 

of work. Theo Robbins came in to 
relieve Ward in the ninth inning and 
kept the game close, sending the 
Tritons into the bottom of the in-
ning, down 3-2. 

The UCSD offense evened 
things up in the bottom of the ninth 
with a run, sending the game into 
extra innings. Cal Lutheran struck 
gold first, knocking in two runs in 
the top of the 11th. 

Eric Quandt (3-6, RBI) singled 
in UCSD's fourth run in the bottom 
of the 11th, and set the stage for yet 
another Triton comeback. But with 
runners on first and second, Ind 
Chris Miyake at the plate, Quandt 
was picked off It first base by the 
Regals' catcher Gilbert Benitez.

QUAUFIERS: UCSD 
sends six more 
athletes to the NCAAs 
ByTedd Ucld 
Spotts Editor 

According to UCSD track and 
field Head Coach Tony Salerno, 
"It's that time of year." 

It's the time of 
year for runners to 
start peaking, and 
- if you're a Tri-
ton - it's the time 
of year to start 
qualifying for 
NCAA Division 
III Nationals. 

Almost on cue, 
the Triton 

traeksters started the break by 
chalking up some big-time perfor-
mances as hosts of the UCSan Di-
ego Open on March 25. 

Eryn Houston leaped to a 
qualifying mark in the long jump 
(7:09), while Ernest Clark quali-
fied in the 400 meters, sprinting 
to a time of 48.72. 

UCSD's Tara Monaghan also 
had an impressive day, launching 
a 152-foot hammer throw - good 
for a qualifying mark, a personal 
best and a new school record. 
Teammate Michaela Monahan did 
well in the 400-meter hurdles, 
notching a low 64.16 time.

Mike Riley took second In

last weekend, the Tritons contino 
ued their winning ways. Lisa 
Shepard grabbed a qualifying 
mark (15.25) in the loo-meter 
hurdles, and the women's 400 re-
lay squad (49.46) did the same. 

In the triple jump, Triton team· 
mates Michele Domico (36' 8.5 ft) 
and Kenya Thacker (36' 7.25ft) 
each qualified as well. For the 
men, UCSD's Randy Buehler was 
the top collegian in the hammer 
throw with a lengthy distance of 
159' 10".

Sports is 
Finally Saved 

Okay, maybe I was wrong. 
Maybe I was a bit too hasty in 
previous columns when I said 
that things always stay the 
same. Hey, I was young. I was 
naive. I was doped up on Fruit 
Roll-Ups. What can I say? 

Things don't always stay 
the same. In fact, sometimes 
things can actually take a 
definite tum for the better. 

After all, how do you 
expl .. in the recent resurgence 
of legitimacy in the local 
sports page? Gone are those 
articles about lame sports like 
figure skating and sailing. 
Gone are those sappy stories 
about the baseball scabs. 

I mean, it 's a bigger 
turnaround than the time they 
airbrushed my face for my 
high school graduation photos. 
It's a miracle. The lifesaver has 
been tossed. The ship has 
come in. Superman has made 
an appearance. The sporting 
world has been saved. 

I'm specifically talkjng 
about the return of baseball, 
Mike Tyson and quality 
matches to the World Wres-
tling Federation. 

At first glance, many of the 
items on the above list may 
appear to be bad ideas from the 
1980s - and, had I more 
space, I would also include the 
comeback of David Hasselhoff 
- but, nevertheless, I implore 
you to consider them seriously. 

Baseball is finally back. It's 
time to go out to the park and 
consume some hot dogs. It's 
time to embrace the real 
players. After all, they 
probably won ' t be on your 
favorite team for long, now 
that free agency is in effect. 

And what about Tyson? 
Finally we'll have a fighter 

H who can keep his belt longer 
than it takes for Van Damme to 
finish off a bad guy with a 
one-armed crunch. Iron Mike 
says he'll be ready to fight in 
six months - I say it will take 
alleast that long for ~m to 
overcome the painful memo-
ries of his loving cell mate. 

. 1 And finally, we have the 
arrival of the great L.T. to the 
W. W.F. circuit. It reminds me 
of the grand 01' days of pro 
wrestling - days of Randy 
"Macho Man" Savage and the 
Junkyard Dog. Everyone knew 
it was fake, but no one said a 
word. Now, L.T. will be tested, 
and I ask: Can he act as well as 
he did when he simulated a pro 
football player a year ago? 

In any case, sports is saved.

Tritons Stage Classic Row 
CREW: UCSD men take revenge on Irvine; women novices make first Grand Final since 1989 
By Grell Wrenn 
Senior Staff Writer 

While the America's Cup had 
trouble just keeping its boats above 
~ater. last week, the UCSD crew 
team had no problems crossing the 
finish line in record times, posting 
one of its best finishes ever in last 
weekend's San Diego Crew Classic. 

Saturday got off to a bang for the 
Tritons when the women's novice-
8 .. A" boat got upstaged at the start-
ing line by both Cal and UC Davis. 

While the tWo schools battled it out 
for the lead over the first 1,000 
meters, UCSD steadily pushed to 
the head of the pack. 

The Tritons overtook Davis soon 
~er and seemed headed for the lead 
as the race flashed by. But Davis 
didn't roll over and staged a come-
back of its own, pushing the Tritons 
to the end. 

UCSD withstood the charge and 
broke the finish line in 7:15.08, 
good enough for second place and 

a spot in Sunday's Grand Final. It 
was the first time a UCSD novice 
.. A" boat had made it to the Grand 
Final in six years. 

Taking a cue from their team-
mates, the women's novice "B" boat 
also landed second place in another 
tight race. The Tritons finished in 
7:40.5, less than a second-and-a-
half off the winning pace set by Sac-
ramento State. The team advanced 
to that afternoon's Grand Final, 
where the "8" boat again made a 

solid showing, garnering third. 
The women's varsity team didn't 

quite share all of the novices' suc-
cess. They placed fourth in their pre-
liminary heat, sending them to the 
petite final, where the Tritons nailed 
down a third-place finish. 

For the UCSD men's varsity 
boat, Saturday's Cal Cup prelimi-
nary was the continuation of a ri-
valry. After defeating UC Irvine ear-
lier this season, the Tritons faced the

in ninth-place behind the

a pair of relay successes. In the

ALL-AMERICAN: UCSD's Janet Wertz earned 
honorable mention All-American honors in epee 
By Dan Kraft 
Associate Sports Editor 

In 1994, the UCSD fencing team 
had a banner year and, for the first 
time, had a player in the NCAA cham-

pionships earn AII-
American honors. 

This year, the Tri-
tons sought to improve 
on that performance by 
sending four competi-
tors to the national tour-
nament in South Bend, 
Indiana. 

The loss of 
key senior 
standouts from 
the 1993-94 
squad, in con-
junction .with 
the youthful 

faces on this year's team, re-
sulted in an expectedly average 
performance at the NCAA "meet 
held March 16-18. The Tritons 
came in J3th, as perennial 
champion Kenyon College ran 
away from the field for. the title. 

In the 2OO-yard freestyle re-
lay, Parkinson and Jefferson 
were once again in the thick of 
the hunt, this time teaming with 
freshmen'TIm McAteer and Bill 
O'Conner. The foursome 
slipped into the finals by out-
dueling Overland College in a 
swim-off and eventually nab-
bing eighth in the country to 
earn All-American remgnition. 

Going up against 
such Division I opponents as Notre 
Dame, Penn State and St. John's, 
UCSD emerged with a 23rd-place fin-
ish and a bit of respect rarely given to 
Division III scbools in this little-
known sport.

All Meat Products 
SANTA CRUZ - UC Santa 
Cruz Chancellor Moon Beam 
Sunshine banned all meat and 
meat products from the 
campus last week. The move 
has widespread support among 
the student body. "Meatism is 
a plague that preys on our 
society," Sunshine said. "We 
must strive to bring equality to 
all food products." The 
campus will still allow vegi-
burgers, but only if the name 
is changed to less "meati'st"

suggested as an alternative.

community, is being widely 
touted by the UC Ri verside 
admi nistration. " It 's very 
similar to every other kind of

she was reading from an

public area. "Frankly, we are 
baffled by this kind of 
behavior," said SDSU 
President Thomas Day. "We 
thought our students knew 
better than this. I mean, we 
have a reputation to uphold." 
SDSU has been ranked among

RIMAC', Inaccessible main arena yesterday. 

RIMAe Sinks 17 Feet 
After Mild Earthquake 
WHACKED: Mafia threats 
may prevent UCSD from 
suing the contractor 
By Bill Clinton 
Needing a Miracle 

Adding to the already lengthy list of prob-
lems at the new center, the east end of the 
Recreational! Intramural Athletic Complex 
(RIMAC) sank 17 feet into the mud following 
a mild earthquake late Saturday night. 

Unnamed experts say RIMAC may con-
tinue to sink for the next several days. 

No one was injured, but repairs to the ath-
letic complex are expected to take up to three 
months and could cost $4 million. 

"Oh man," said Assistant . Chancellor of 
Facilities Design and Contruction Boone 
Hellmann when he arrived on campus Sunday 
morning. "I feel like crying." 

Moran Construction, which built RIMAC at 
a cost of$34 million, relocated to Sicily yester-
day and was unavailable for comment. 

Despite a university finding that Moran is 
completely responsible for the damage, UCSD 
has no plans to pursue legal action against the 
contracting company, according to Hellmann. 

"They have mob ties," he said. "We tried to 
sue them last month and they knocked off 
Tommy [Tucker]. I'm keeping my mouth shut." 

"This is all off the record, right?" he added. 
Construction crews worked furiously Sat-

urday night to stop the sinking and stabilize the 
foundation, according to RIMAC Project Co-
ordinator Erik Larson. 

With the sinking halted, crews worked Sun-
day to reopen the complex. 

"We've dug down and found the entrance, 
but students will slide down a muddy embank-
ment to get to the door," Larson said.

Parking Permit 
Fees to Double 
This Quarter 
DECEIT: Increased revenue to 
fund more meter maids. Student 
leaders plan protest 
By Sonny Bono 
Not to be Taken Seriously 

Responding to complaints about the lack of 
student parking spaces on campus, Transportation 
and Parking Services is planning to double the 
price of a student parking permit. 

The new parking fee, which will be raised to 
$160 per quarter, is designed to discourage stu-
dents from parking on campus, according to Park-
ing Czar Peter Afsari. The new rate will go into 
effect immediately. 

"If we keep jacking up the price, maybe stu-
dents will start walking to school or taking the 
bus," said Afsari. "If we ' re lucky, maybe they'll 
drop out all together," he added. 

The increased parking revenue will be used to 
hire eight new parking enforcement officers, Afsari 
added. 

"Hey, I'll show those kids a 'parking Ge-
stapo,'" Msari said. "The twerps don't know how 
good they had it." 

Students were outraged by the decision. "I'm 
outraged," said Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Amanda Monchamp. "And I don't even have a 
car." 

The Associate Students won't debate the issue 
until their Wednesday night meeting, but a plan to 
fight the fee hike has already been developed, 
according to A.S. President Carla Tesak. 

"We are ·going to hold a bunch of poorly at-
tended and badly planned protests that won't ac-
complish anything," Tesak said. "Basically, the 
normal routine." 

Members of CALPIRG immediately issued a 
press release stating that the group planned to 
work with the A.S. to fight the proposed increase. 

"We plan to circulate petitions," said CALPIRG 
member Michael Kinoshita. "It won't do any good, 
but we are in the petition business. That's just what 
we do." 

Added Student Environmental Action Coali-
tion (SEAC) member and head cheerleader Louisa 
Cammidge, "They're doing their damnedest to 
take away my only vice: driving my muscle car. 
My God, it's like taking the 1-15 away from a 
compulsive gambler."

$5 Million 'Faculty Club Walk' Approved Unanimously 
By Richard Bey 
Sinking to New Lows 

Plans for a $5 million "Faculty 
Club Walk" were given final ap-
proval last week after Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson used his power to 
quell dissent over the proposal. The 
project will be solely funded by a 
S35-per-quarter student fee hike. 

The 1,500-foot walkway, which 
will stretch from the Chancellor's 
Complex to the Faculty Club, will 
require the permanen't removal of 
450 eucalyptus trees and over 100 
student parking spaces. 

It will also include a moving 
walkway for use by top administra-
tors. 

According to Senior Campus 
Planner Sara Davison, the walkway 
is necessary to ensure Atkinson's 
safe passage between the Faculty 
Club Bar and his office. 

"Sometimes Dick gets pretty 
tanked and has a hard time getting 
back to his office," Davison said. 
"With this he won't hurt himself 
anymore." 

Students will be barred from us-
ing the moving walkway, but can 
wander down the 2S-foot -wide path 
on weeken<4 and after 11 p.m. on 
weekdays. 

wrhat way students will get plenty 
of exercise," said Vice Oaancellor 
of Undergraduate Affair. Joe 

Watson. "Besides, I've always felt 
that adminisrators need more perks." 

However, the project came un-
der criticism during a heated Aca-
demic Senate meeting yesterday. 

"I hate this. It makes me want to 
vomit," said Political Science Pro-
fessor Peter Irons. 

Atkinson promptly ended debate 
by directing eight UCSD police of-
ficers to beat Irons with a tire iron. 

"Cross me, and I'll squash you 
like a bug," Atkinson told the mem-
bersofthe Senate as Irons was beaten 
bloody in front of the podium. 

The Senate voted unanimously 
to approve the Faculty Club Walk.

It Is Time to Hunt the 
Regents Down Uke Dogs 

We've been bad. Bamboozled. Hoodwinked. Suckered. Led 
astray. Indeed, we bave been played like a buncb of dim-willed 
college boobs. Last February, as we toiled to gatber thousands of 
T-sbirts for our "Rip tbe Shirts Off Our Backs, But Don't Raise 
Our Fees" protest, as we chanted silly anti-fee-hike slogans and 
banged on bongo drums like a bunch of mindless eM hippies -
indeed, as we collectively labored for the greater good of human-
ity - tbe UC Board of Regents secretly met in dark, smoky 
quarters to, yes, laugh at us. And worse. 

Ob sure, the regents act real nice in public. They pretend to 
care about us and all tbat is fine and good and decent. Buttbat's 
all it is: Pretend. Make-believe. An elaborate subterfuge. A clever 
ruse to bide what we've suspected all along: That they are evil. 
When tbe regents descend into "closed session," they don't fret 
about student fee increases, faculty pay cuts or our rapidly 
sinking $34 mi11ion athletic center, they break out the vodka and 
cigars, and begin plotting against us and all of bumankind. 

Indeed, when tbe regents were at UCSD, the predominantly 
ricb, white, male board spent nearly three hours getting drunk, 
trading jabs about our T-shirt protest and contacting the undead, 
ac.cording to someone really important who knows tbese things. 
In just one disturbing example, Regent Roy Brophy, who has a 
really sketchy bistory as a renegade TIbetan monk, snidely 
remarked, "I'm reaUy beginning to bate these whining, fee-

~ellling punks. Fee hikes, sbmee bikes. That's alii ever bear!" 
~g to SMleGoe, lie lat~ ~, "Next time, we should 
just bire that Guido feUa to break some legs, maybe In arm or 
two. Or beller yet, just clock 'em in the head a couple a times and 
bury 'em under RIMAC. I hear Moran Construction [the mob-
tied contractor of RIMAe) does good, clean work. And cheap, 
too. Poor Tommy [Tucker], he never knew what hit him." The 
room then reportedly exploded in shrill cackles. 

Whether instruments of Satan or The Man, the regents and 
their slavish cronies have taken our trusting, little hearts and 
crumbled them up one too many times. They are, withOut a doubt, 
rotten to the core, and we can no longer tum the other check. 

Indeed, upon reading this editorial, a teary-eyed and enraged 
A.S. President Carla Tesak pledged to fight back. "I pledge to 
fight back, " she fumed, unveiling a new, systemwide anti-fee 
campaign, "Rip the Shirts off tbe Regents' Backs." According to 
UC Student Association Director of Insurgency Naomi Falk, 
hundreds of disgruntled students will bum-rush tbe regents at 
their next meeting, tear off their c10tbes and sell tbem as souve-
nirs to passersby. The proceeds - tacky neck ties will reportedly 
sell for $S,OOO, pentagrams for an astounding $25,000 - will go 
toward filling the $1.5 billion UC budget sbortfall. 

But this is just a beginning. A modest one at that. The regents 
and their high-paid dupes - their freakish inner-circle - deserve 
nothing less than a public, Singapore-style flogging. They 
deserve nothing less tban being hunted down like rabid dogs in 
the streets. The list of injustices is long and harried, stained with 
the blood of students and probably numerous small, sacrificial 
animals. They've turned this university, once a wellspring of 
knowledge and vision, into a place of mass indoctrination, 
working in the service of The Man/Satan. They've made this 
university, once accessible to the masses, into a country club for 
rich kids, banishing The People- to menial jobs at McDonalds 
and other expressions of capitalist culturelhell. They've spit on, 
lied to, exploited, marginalized, mocked and otherwise dissed us 
at every possible tum. Good God, they made Carla Tesak cry. 

Oh, the horror! 
Only when our oppressors are loppled from tbeir thrones, only 

when the students have control over their university, only when 
Jack Peltason is reduced to cleaning toilets at the Price Center will 
we truly be free. Of course, the new order won't spring from willy-
nilly protests and petitions, however courageous and noble they 
may be. We're dealing with animals who care nothing at aU about 
what is fine and good and decent. Yes, we'll need guns - big 
guns. And bullets -lots of 'em. Armed with AK 47s and guided 
by Tesak's glorious leadership, we will be unstoppable. Oh sure, 
the battle will be long and bard. Some will die under the boots of 
the regental death macbine. Others will be found to be treacherous 
leaches and disposed of accordingly. But from the rotting car-
casses, a new university - indeed, a new society - will emerge 
like a big pimple on tbe pasty face of capitalist-regental oppres-
sion. When we prevailed, tbe blood will cease to flow, the flowers 
will spring from the eartb and everyone will be bappy, living 
barmoniously together like one big, loving family.

DEEP FRy THE DOLPHINS 
COMMENTARY: Those damn tree huggers are letting the dolphins 

destroy America, the free world is being held hostage by a fish 
By Pewter ChenI 

• Everybody Wang Chang Tonight 
When the creepy earthgirl, who chased me into a 

comer from which I could not hope to escape, 
offered me a petition 'and a pen with which to sign it, 
I had to ask, "Okay sport, what's tbe liberal agenda 
tmjour?" 

Eartbalrt: Dolphins 
DolpItins? Sensing an article, I moved in for the 

kill. 
Me: Dolphins? What about them? 
Eartbglrt: The Navy wants to 

"dispose" their dolphins. They say they 
can't survive in the wilderness, but 
they refuse to keep the dolphins until 
places like Sea World can make room 
for them, so tbey're going to destroy 
the poor things. 

Me: Hmm ... are these the dolphins 
tbat the Navy trained to bear explosives 
and sink commie ships? ... 

market crashes would disappear. We could eliminate 
hunger. We could eliminate homelessness. We could 
provide boundless opportunities for all Americans and 
eliminate Affirmative Action. 

It is a fact that Lyndon B. Johnson (the OtIly 
Democratic president with any merit at all in this 
century) had planned to eliminate the dolphin population 
to realize these social benefits. But just as "Operation 
Dolphin Deep Fry" was about to get underway, the 
television show Flipper hit the nation like crack and 
LBJ was forced to cancel the operation. Since then, the 

masses have been addicted to dolphins, 
who are portrayed to be as smart and 
wonderful as dogs. Really. A dolphin 
as smart as a dog? Tell that to my dog 
McCarthy. He's really smart. He bites 
liberals and barks along with the . 
national anthem. 

Earthgirt: Tears running down her 
face) Y-yes, those p-poor dolphins. 
How coCould anyone be so insensitive 
as to use living b-beings as weapons? 

Me: Easy. In the defense of the 
nation, we must apply any means 
necessary. You radicals can't even 
begin to appreciate the value of good 
old-fashioned exploitation. It's what 

If dolphins .e 
80 smart, why 
dotheyk .. p 
drowning In tuna 
nets? 

If dolphins are so smart, why do 
they keep drowning in tuna nets. Tuna 
nets don't just appear. out of nowhere 
and gobble them up, they just kinda 
hangin the water. Dolphinsaren'tblind. 
That is, they can see. You'd thi nk they 
would catch on after the first few 
hundred dolphin. deaths. Despite the 
caterwauling by the ignorant liberal 
masses, it's not the tuna fishers' fault 
that the dolphins are so stupid. If 
dolphins were dogs, dolphins would 

America was built on, and if some kooky earthgirllike 
yourself can't appreciate our country, I invite you to 
leave. Love it or leave it, babe. 

Earthglrt: Pig! Nazi! Fascist! 
Me: Hippie! Druggie! Pinko! 
Earthglrl: I'm moving to Mongolia. (leaves) 
The petition, having been abandoned by the earth 

girl, possessed several hundred liberal signatures, 
probably all forgeries. I almost disposed of them in a 
recycling bin, but caught myself just In time. You can't 
support these recyclers, they're as creepy as the rest of 
the radical fringe, like tree-huggers and life-lovers. 

But I digress. 
What's all the argle-bargle about? Dolphins are 

nothing more than pests, the rodents of the seaways. 
Among other things, they tangle up ships' propulsion 
systems, forcing ships to stop until crewman can clean 
the bloody mess from the propellers, rudders, sails and 
other things that make ships go. This in turn, delays the 
arrival time of cargo ships, which drives up the price of 
goods, which leads to global economic woe. If there 
were no dolphins, inflations, recessions and stock 

never wind up in tuna nets - in fact, dolphins wouldn 'I 
be in the oceans. Do you ever see dogs in the ocean? I 
don't. The sea is a dangerous place. I don't think 
dolphins are as smart as dogs. 

Bul I digress again. 
The fact is that the dolphins, with their easily duped 

lilleral friends, are deliberately destroying America. 
The Navy is well aware of this situation, and that is why 
they cannot let the dolphins loose. Nor can they let 
Seaworld take the dolphins, for another Free Willy 
could occur. And God knows wecan 't have that happen 
again. 

I will continue to support the extinction of dolphins, 
to search fortuna cans not marked "dolphin safe." I will 
eat up lots of t!tis tuna, and so will McCarthy, my best 
friend . 

We will eat all kind of tuna and cheer whenever we 
see those documentaries on PBS that depict tuna fishers 
pulling dead dolphins out of the ocean, entangled in the 
nets. McCarthy and I will not live in the ocean because 
we know better. We will fight until the world is safe 
from the despicable designs of the dolphin.

Resident midget . 

If you can't run with the little 
boys, you ' re probably better off 
resting on the short porch. 

The UCSD ~.~ midget baseball iii ~ team elected 10 
-.10&&&.l1:li:"- do the former in 

last weekend's game against UCR 
at Triton Whiffle Ball Stadium. 

Short some of their key players, 
the Tritons gave new meaning to the 
phrase "big things come in small 
packages" en route to a 5-3 crush-
ing of the visiting Highlandes. 

"We came through in a enormous 
way," UCSD big man Henri 

Rosenbaum said. "In the top of Ihe 
second, we had some huge hits that 
put us over the hump." 

Rosenbaum was merely a cog in 
the highly touted "pequeno pack" of 
Sal Wayson, Tim Nofal and Mitch 
Freelow that led the Triton barrage 
with three hilS overall. 

"We hit everything. We reached 
new heights," Nofal said. "That was 
the long and short of it." 

Indeed, UCSD jumped out to a 
3-0 lead at the bottom of the first, 
as Highlande pitcher Clam 
Schneider was conlinually baffled 
by the small strike zone. 

"I was baffled by the small strike 
zone," Schneider said. 

UCSD racked up six consecutive 
walks before Schneider finally 
found his range. 

"I was inspired by the movie 
Willow," Triton cleanup hitter Jay 
Agarwal said. "I just waited, and 
[Schneider) kept throwing high." 

In a scene reminiscent of Snow 
White amd the Seven Dwarfs, 
UCSD ganged up on the UCR 
Goliath, tallying two hits in the bot-
tom of the fifth to take a 5-0 lead. 

In fact, Triton slugger Freelow 
showed that he wasn't vertically 
challenged, launching a 35-foot 
home-run blast into the lower deck.

i felt emotional 
pandemonium 

I saw I Whopper of a game 
last weekend. When it was all 
over, alii could recall was the 

A New Era of Triton Football 
, emotional pandemonium. Yes, 

lots of emotional pandemo-
nium. It was full of pulsating, 
radiant pandemonium, and it 
shone all around us and filled 
us with exceedingly great joy! 

The gladiators of the field 
who reigned victorious after 
that last tick of the game clock 
had finally and ultimately 
expired were truly magnificent 
to behold. 

It was breathtaking to 
watch those gods of the 
gridiron conquer everyone in 
all their glorious glory. 

.., After all, it took many 
hours of heartbreaking 
practices, twisted shoe laces 
and broken dreams to get to 
this point. Yeah, quite a 
journey it had been leading up 
to that point in chronological 
time that we call 'The Game.' 

SPIRIT: The UCSD football team is now a reality; inaugurai 
season will begin next September at new BIGMAC Stadium 
By Hector Comacho 
Guardian middleweight contender 

Get ready for excitement, UCSD. 
It's the beginning of a whole new era - an 

exhilarating season of Triton football starting

early next year. And with 
that announcement comes 
big changes to the UCSD 
mascot and uniforms. 

"I'm really psyched 
about our new mascot," 
administrator Tommy 
Tucker said. "The UCSD 
Fighting Words will 
strike fear into their op-
ponents." 

In addition, the Words 
will change their own duds to honor the 38th 
season since the creation of the pastel-colored 
uniform by Dolphins' fashion expert Willie 
"Funny Shoes" Johnson. 

squad, and it will hold official tryouts next week 
for spots on the team. All athletic students, in-
cluding lacrosse players, hockey fanatics and 
Women's Resource Center members are 
encourged to apply. 

The Words' first unofficial scrimmage took 
place last Wednesday against the Florida State 
Crappy Criminals. UCSD didn't score within 
all four quarters of the 56-0 defeat - actually 
coming closest to the end zone during the coin 
toss. 

"I was just praying that the clock would run 
out," UCSD quarterback Phil Garfinkle said. 
"Occasionally, I got lucky and the rusher would 
be blinded by my pink uniform. Then I was 
able to complete a pass." . 

The Words' best chance at crossing the 50-
yard line occured late in the game. UCSD's 
Scott Paden was brutally crushed into the turf 
during one of his 23 punts, and his wits spilled 
out onto the freshly cut grass. In his stupor, 
Paden declined the 15-yard penalty, and UCSD 
stayed within its own territory. In fact, aliI could say - all I could utter out of my 

salivating, nervous, twitching 
mouth - was "Boy, some 
guys those guys are." 

Mandelal GuBfllian supermodel and world leader 
Walter Payton might coach the Tritons. 

"I'm worried about our pink and silver-let-
tered uniforms," likely Head Coach Walter 
Payton said. "They're just not going to strike 
fear into our opponents." 

UCSD has already signed up a practice 

"We just can't strike fear in our opponents," 
coaching candidate O.J. Simpson said. "A large 
shovel would certainly do the trick."

and crispy like the bacon on a 
new Burger King Monterey

LABOR WAR: Tritons boycott season and demand free agency, no salary 
cap and perks; 'bloody pustules' to replace them for the remainer of year 

No, no. I am instead 
required to only reflect on your 
bountiful acts of grace. I can 
only write about your godli-
ness in this fledgling paper. 

You see, 0 great ones, I am 
a sportswriter. I am fond of the 
adjectives, clever verbs and 
stupid puns, but moreso, I am 
fond of you. 

Yes you, 0 noble Division 
III athlete. You are the one 
who chalks up a Whopper of a 
performance day in and day 
out. You are the one who gives 
it your all. You are the one 
who reminds me of freshly cut 
Burger King fries. 

It doesn't matter if you've 
got a bruised thumb or a 
bruised ego, you always give it 
your all, and in the end you 
always have your chin up. It 
makes me want to go off and 
get married for no logical 
reason, I tell you. 

It was total emotional 
pandemonium. Complete 
emotional pandemonium.

Garth·s good-natured brother 

In a surprise move last week, the 
Triton baseball players' union an-
nounced that it will boycott the rest 

of the season un-
less the UCSD 
owners meet its 
demands. 

Demanding 
free agency, a r.e-
peal of the salary 
cap and various 
perks - free dry 
cleaning, easy fi-

nals and a "dinner date with Judy 
Sweet" lotto drawing - the strik-
ing players publically read a list of 
grievances to the owners. 

"We're not going to take it any-
more," frustrated shortstop Holland 
Gallupp said. "If I want to play at 
UC Riverside, I should be able to 
play at UC Riverside. Of course, I'd 
be insane to make that request, but 
it was just an example." 

The owners' response so far has 
been loud and clear - a strike 
would only mean the unveiling of 
scab replacement players or, as the 
Triton players' union calls them, 
"the bloody pustules."

New Mascot 
Draws Fire 
From OLAF 
By Van Drlesen 
Our Man in Finland 

The UCSD athletic depart-
ment found itself in a quandry 
last week after receiving com-
plaints that the current Triton 
mascot fails to recognize the 
achievements of other Omnipo-
tent Gods of the Sea. 

Director Judy Sweet recom-
mended that teams either take 
their cue from the new football 
squad (the Fighting Words) or be 
renamed 'the Satanic Scandina-
vians. This drew immediate fire 
from Ulf Svenderlund, president 
of the Organization for the Love 
and Affection of Finland (OLAF). 

"That is unacceptable," 
Svenderlund said. "I'm sick and 
tired of Finland taking the blame 
for Devil worship in Scandinavia 
when we all know it's those 
Swedes drawing their damned 
pentagrams everywhere." 

"And what about those pesky 
Norweigians?" Svenderlund 
continued. "I hear they're run-
ning out of virgins up there, and 
it ain't because they're feeling 
frisky either. Do I have to spell 
it out for you, man? Sacrifices!
