Proposition 11 
The bottle and can initiative THE ~r-T '.;lA"iTING LIGHr OF ALIl'uMN 1i1E G£N1U. MELLOW AIR FLiNNY LITTLE COLORED THINGS FALLING 

OfF -mE lREES $UWDA~ Am'R~00N ~RE 'S IjO Foor8ALL I'M OUTS I DE I AAARG~ !' 

The Facts: Litter co ts taxpayers in California $100 million 
a year. Cans and bottles are the biggest contributors at 40% 
to 60%. The bottle bill require that all beer and soft drink 
cans and bottles have a 5¢ deposit 

Give Oscar a helping hand 
Six states have successfully put the bill into use and adopted 
in by wide margins: 

Oregon, 90% voter support 
Maine, 84% voter upport 
Vermont, 92% voter support 
Michigan, 78% voter support 

20.000 barrels of oil a day are needed for bottle and can 
manufactUring In California. 
Bottler and brewer, are spending lOmdllon to oppo~e it. 

The Pro's: Di~posable contamer's cost the consumer1O''{ 
more per ou nce of soft drink . 
DIsposable contamers cost t he consumer 20'''i, more per 
ounce of beer. 
[n the twelve years since the transItion to thro\\; away 
containers there ha, been a is'v, increase in can and bottle 
litter. 
The equIvalent of 7.000 barrles of oil will be saved dailv or 
110 mIllIon gal/ons of ga per year. - . 
One bottle. recycled 10 tImes cuts the number of bottles 
produced by 90')(,. 
The bIll would prmide 4.700 iobs, 
It would reward opposers of litter, and penalize creators of 
lItter. 

The Cons: A SIX pack of ~oft dnnks \\ould requin.' a ~()<;: 
depOSIt. DIsputers claim that there will be long lInes at the 
<,upermarkets to get deposit · back. 

, atlOnal breWIng and soft drink compames fear Increased 
competition and I he hassle of transporting bottles hundred 
of miles to centralized brewenes.

As I stood amid discarded

character from Sesame Street

I vaguely recalled that 
Propo. ition II is the so-called 
Bottle Bill. A quick glance at 
surroundings proved to me 
that it wa indeed a wort hy 
cause; not only for Califor· 
nians in general, but for the 
youth of our I>tate who 
consume the majority of 
bottled and canned beverages. 

o what does that ha\ e to do 
v..ith us as students of lICS!)? 

We are Uni\'ersit \' of 
CalIfornia st udents wit"h the 

elIglbllllY to vOle for Prop. 11 
and the enerh')' to promote its 
passage. Du to our rom,ump' 

tion levels, we are the main 
factor of influence in regard to 
thi, bill. It has been estimated 
that thi state's university 
st udents alone can generate 
over 100,000 votes. Here before 
us is an issue of major 
importance that is worth the 
effort of sup porting -
because, for a change. we can 
make a dIfference. 

It would be \\'()rth your 
while to dleck into it. 

There are nn'C<lmIHIS 
organI/allOn~ SUPIXlrt ing thIs 
Initi1l11\'e where you can go to 
get Involved and receive 
Informal ion. 

One is CaIPIRG. the 
California Public Interest 
Research Group who ha\'e 
theIr office in Room 20R of the 

tudent Center. This s tudent· 
directed group works for 
envIronmental pre~ervation. 
consumer rights and safe 
energy. They would be happy 
to provide pamphlets. answer 
any questions, and discuss 
Prop. 11 with you. 

The Recycling Co-oP. abo at 
the Student Center, IS co 
:->IXlnsoring the issue. You may 
want to drop by there on some 
aft ernoon bet ween now and 
Novem ber 2, \'ot ing day. 

Your best bet: Read the pro's 
and con's printed in this issue. 
Know the factI> , Th n. register 
to vote. and vote "yes" on 
Proposition 11. This is the 
time when student involve· 
ment can be the key to victory.

ment of people. 

During the campaign 
your party claimed, "The 
current dissatisfaction 
\\ ith the A rose (rom 
careless spe ndi ng to 
pursue personal ambi· 
tions. AS re!>ources should 
be rechanneled to ~tudenl 
organizat ions and pro· 
grams that provide direct 
services to students," 
"Vith this in mind and l·on· 
sidering what you just said 
aren't you in fact spending 
to reach J>er!-oonal aims? 

No. Flr~t of all. becau~e I am 
not a sllCnl'eJ11;1jor(Parkerl sa 
Pollt Ical 'cll'nlc maJor), I h(1\ e 
been thInkIng about an 
entirel~ ciIffen:nt UC D com-
munity III I he ab(lve state-
ment I \\'ould say that my 
ambItIons are campus-wid(. 
rather than personal ambi-
tIOn . But I think ambItions In 
general are t he sou rce of good 
product l\ e work. fhat IS, 
ambitions In general, not per-
"onal. They are personal In 
t hat the~ came from my mind, 
but not in their aims. 

Do you think that this is a 
bit beyond the scope o( 
what you were elected to 
do? 

o. becau"c my main job is 
to see that people have fun, but 
t hat does not exclude acknowl-
edging that my constituents 
are also intelligent. 

Is that a popular philo· 
sophy among the AS? 

I don't know, everyune has a 
differenl job. But am'one who 
u nderest imate:-. the st uden t s 
\\ ill lose theIr support. 

You said earlier that 
your ideas had to go 
through AS channels_ Now 
you !-oay that everyone has 
a different job and possibly 
a different philosophy, 

Doc~n't that create quite a 
problem? 

Having to have my pro-
grams approved is not the nor-
mal proces~. After my item 
budget IS passed, the program· 
ming \\ ill lx' my rc ' ponsibility 
cxc1usl\ elv . 

Meaning that David has 
$29.000 o( the !.tudents' 
money to do what he want!. 
with? 

!'Jo, because there wIll 
always be people that have 

i(k-a~ for programs that the} 
want me to put on. To say that 
I ha\ c all that money person 
ally to spend \ .... ould be to pre-
tend that the other ten 
thou,-,and ... tudents don't eXIst 
ancll am not of that mind . 

At t he end uf the day if 
David Pa,'ker ",anb to 
!-,pcnd X amount of dollars 
on a given project, which 
he feels i~ in line wit h hi~ 
prugramming philosophy, 
how can he be stopped? 

It i" a bIg responsibIlity, but 
somcone has to take it. We 
can' t \'ote on e\ery program, 
At ... ome POInt someone ha~ to 
go out on a limb. It is a little bit 
frightening to be told to spend 
that much of other people's 
money without the most gen· 
eral instruction as to what the 
re 'lIlts shou ld be. [am respect· 
ful and attentive to that sense 
of caution in myself. 

\Vould you prefer more 
guidelines? 

With ta"tes and trends as 
t hey are, to try to legIslate pop-
ular, fu n acti ... lties would be 
foll y. Rather than &fUidelines, 
direet input from the general 
student body is the most valua-
ble indicator for me.

had been UCSO's ch ief reson 
for removing the old structure. 
When the original plan of the 
building were located in the 
archives of the Art Depart· 
ment at the University of 
California, Santa Barbara, it 
wa discovered that Gill had 
used Kahn Trus,ed Bar steel 
reinforcing, developed by 
Julius and Albert Kahn of 
Detroit In 1903. After theplans 
were located, engineering 
studie showed t hat the 
building was stronger than 
had been realized, and that 
major structural change 
would not be required to meet 
modern ei mic afety 
standards. 

Thefund needed to put Old 
cripp Building back into u e 

were estimated at abou t 
$400,000. Budgetary const· 
raints precluded ecuri ng 
funds from University of 

.. 

Callforma, so t he committee 
appealed to individuals, 
foundations, and corporation .. 
The resp()n~e generated 
enough fund~ to appl) for and 
recei\'e 75.000 of match11lg 
grant Federal Historic 
Preservat Ion Fund~. 

The first phase of 
restorat IOn was done in 1979, 
after man\' hours of \'olunteer 
preparatory work, with an 
estimated sa\'lng' of $15,000. 
Restorat ion plans were 
prepared by architects John 
Henderson and G reg Brown of 
Macy, Henderson, and Cole of 
San Diego, and John Kariotis, 
structura l engineer of 
Kariot i , Kessler, a nd Allys of 
Pasadena. E.F. Couvretle of 
San Diego was the general 
con tract or. 

The commiltee has conl in· 
ued its fund·rai ing efforts, to 
provide for later phases of 
restorat ion. When completed, 

The UCSD Gua rdian 

the build ing will be used for 
resear c h offices a nd a

Inst itution. One laboratory 
wi ll be restored with turn·of· 
t he·cen t ur y furni s hin gs, 
including cabinets from the 
building that were carefu lly 
saved by t he volunteer work 
parties ' andd will be reo 
11lstalled. 

"We hope to gi ve the 
build11lg functional space with 
the am bience it once enjoyed," 
said Spies .. "and this shou ld 
be accomplis hed by the end of 
the instit ut ion' 80th 
anniversary year, in 1983, if 
we receive the remaining 
funds that are required."

Honey. we're home. 

Well, after years of frustration , disgust. extortion and confusion 
(or maybe a couple of restless nights) Niatusis here. The " Magazine 
of the '80s" is at your newstand now. Produced and designed by 
some of the greatest minds in America. it is with pleasure I present 
the first issue of this soon-to-be-an-institution magazine, 

Why? From the first day I stepped barefoot on this great campus 
of ours, I have been hearing the same thing over and over. (No, it's 
not "Get some Shoes.") It was everywhere - in the dorms. at 
lectures, at AS meet i n~s, shouted at parties and whispered in the 
library - " It's bad enough t his school doesn't have a football team, 
but when there is no week ly arts and entertainment magazine, then 
it's time to leave." 

ffialus will give you everything you ever wan ted to know about 
the arts but were afraid to ask. We' ll go beyond who, what. where, 
when and why to give you the straight poop on anything from an 
Aztec exhibit to a xylaphone concert and everything in between. 
We'lI cover all the events and if we don't we'lI make it up. 
Dedication is job one at Hiatus. Missing class is job two. 

This is a students· magazine: produced by, distributed by, and 
read by the students. Don't ask what ffiatuscan do for you. but what 
you can do for Hialus. We want to know what you want to see on 
these pages. We want Comm. majors to communicate; Soc. majors 
to be sociable: Lit. majors to be literate and AMES majors to be 
aimless. 

If you are interested in writing, please come in and talk to us at 
our new reconditioned plush offices. If you have opinions, 
suggestions, recipes, or bomb threats please send them to us at 
Hiatus, B-016, La Jolla, 92093 or call 452-3466. It is your support 
and encouragement we want to make this a successful endeavor 
and it is your money and drugs we need to make this a happy 
editorial staff. 

" We are not (t gang, we are a magazine." 
Get well soon,

KSDTon the 
air for the 
students 

By ANDRf W KfflLR 
One AS official was recently 

talking about UCSD's own 
student radio station KSOT, " I 
love their programming. I think 
they are the best station in 
town. but I can·t see funding 
them unless they broadcast to 
the UCSD student community, 
namely on campus." 

station. "This summer we were 
playing 99% music, and there is 
no listener involvement this 
way. We are planning to do more 
community service programs, 
which include possibly 
broadcasting the Wednesday 
night AS meetings. We welcome 
political groups, faculty. staff or 
anyone with views on current 
issues to come in and speak.' 

Also to be expanded at KSDT 
this year is the sports 
department. Lead by sports 
director Mike Greenberg, the 
stalion is considering 
broadcasti ng UlSO basketball 
games as well as covering the 
other sports and clubs on 
campus. A weekly feature being 
offered is Sportsline which deals 
with issues concerning on and 
off campus sports 

Until this year, KSDT's signal 
has been available only to 
subscribers of Cox Cable and 
Southwestern Cable at 95.7 FM, 
This audience includes listeners 
from as far away as EI Cajon and 
Encinitas. The only problem 
with the stUdent-run station was 
their inability to reach their 
desired audience - the student 
population. 

KSDT program d irector Rob Olmsted bringing 'real' radio to the UCSD students and community. 

The station broadcasts from 6 
a.m. to 2 a.m. everyday and 
plans to expand to 24 hours on 
weekends. Although it is a non-
commercial entity, Olmsted 
hopes to see a few ads mixed in. 

" We have been trying to get 
on campus since we began 14 
years ago in a closet on Warren 
campus," explains program 
director Rob Olmsted. "The AS 
doesn't seem to realize that we 
want to be on campus just as 
much or more than they want us 
to." 

It has been a continual 
stru~~le for Olmsted. general 
manager Karyn King and the 
rest of the KSDT staft' to keep 
their AS funding in the face of 
strong opposition from several 
officials who feel the station is 
not serving the students whose 
money goes into financing it. 

Push almost came to .. hove 
last year when KSDT invited 

politican and KKK leader Tom 
Metzger to an on-air interview in 
their student center studio. 
Lead by former AS President 
Jules Bagneris a group of angry 
students protested the station's 
actions and the AS threatened 
to pull the plug on KSDT after a 
very heated AS meeting. 

However. KSDT survived the 
crisis and is now on campus. 
Thanks to a system known as 
"AM carrier current" which 
works through the AC system in 
the buildings on campus. 
Olmsted says being on AM was 
not their first choice. " We would 
love to be on FM, but there 
wasn't and still aren't any 
available frequencies for 
commercial or non-commercial 
stations in San Diego. We are in

We 're already at Muir in Tenaya

projects that by the end of this 
quarter KSDT will be available in 
the rest of Revelle and all of 
Warren campus. Getting the 540 
AM signal into Third College will 
present a problem due to the 
mUlti -unit design of the 
architecture. 

Wherever students are 
listening, they will be treated to 
some of the most interesting 
and provocative musical 
programming around. ' The

programming challenging. We 
want to challenge the listeners 
concept of what radio is and 
what it can be. We also try to 
educate by exposing the listener 
to a wide range of musical 
styles. 

'We are not KPRJ and don·t 
ever want to be, we want to keep 
our freedom. We are interested 
in showcasing new and obscure 
groups as well as classic artists, 
but we're not going to play 
blocks of Styx or REO 
Speedwagon. Along with the 
regular programming we will be 
having a new music show on 
Sunday nights, along with ajazz 
program and two live concert 
series." 

Olmsted sees a need to 
broaden the scope of the 

If we just ran five minutes of 
commercials in a program day 
it would bring in extra income 
to pay for and repair equipment. 
We could never expect to show a 
profit. but some added revenue 
would be welcomed. 

Students interested in 
possibly working at KSDT in any 
facet of broadcasting can go in 
and talk to Olmsted or King as 
soon as possible. 

Finally the student radio 
station is available to the 
students. If they tune it in is 
another story, Olmsted is not 
worried, I m sure once they 
hear what they have been 
missing. theonlycomplaintwill

There may come a time In 
one's life when the pursuit of 
knowledge. tv programming. or 
the prospects of a good night's 
sleep mean little or nothing. At 
this point one may feel 
compelled to venture forth from 
his or her place or residence and 
get "a piece of the action." This 
phenomena is indeed common. 
and perhaps i best ummed up 
with the words of an immortal 
pop song - I forgot the title -
which clearly states. "I love the 
night life. I've got to boogie ... " 

San Diego club scene bordering 
on the edge of respectability 

atmosphere. Cowboy boots and 
hats are optional. but not 
necessary. 

The Club I-D is a very "new" 
place In the true sense of the 
word, Open only a few months. it 
features new music, sometimes 
played live but mostly by DJs. 
clientel in new fashions. doing 
new dances. It is really more a 
place to pose and be seen than 
to go and get sweaty. although 
the music - usually the late.!>t 
in European dance music - is 
on the whole exceptional. 

Local venues serve up a mixed dish of musical expression 

A witty retort to the above 
statement could be this two line 
poem: "But where in this 
town/Can one get down?" And 
now we come to the meat ofthis 
article. 

San Diego's dance places can 
be very easily separated into 
two sections: over 21 and 
underage, or drink inside or out 
In the parking lot. It is of no 
surprise to most that while so-
called "wet" clubs are being 

fruitful and multiplying, the 
"dry" clubs have been. in the 
words of Mel Brooks. "fruitless 
and subtracted:' This is a 
shame. because much of the 
more original San Diego music 
is being played in these dance 
joints. 

Several of San Diego's more 
premier "rock nightclubs," or 
whatever one chooses to call 
them. are the Spirit. on Buenos 
Ave.. The Bacchanal. on 
Clairemont Mesa Blvd .. 
Headquarters Nightclub. in 
Pacific Beach. the Distilleries -
Escondido's Distillery East. in 
Escondido. and the aptly named 

By DAVID flLMINGfR 
Distillery Nightclub, in Solana 
Beach. the King's Road Cafe. on 
Thirtieth St., and Club I-D. at EI 
cajon Blvd. 

There are. of course. many 
other places in this wonderful 
town to see and hear loud 
music. but the above places lead 
the way in proletariat hipness. 
or working-class jetsetting. 
They also place more of an 
emphasis on shaking thy booty 
than looking for Mr. Goodbar to 
the tune of boring Top 40 or. at 
worst. undanceable Lounge 
music. 

The Spirit. the Bacchanal. the 
Distillery Nightclub. and Club 1-
D are all "wet" (no pun 
intended). The Spirit is an ok 
place with a bi~ bar and a tiny 

,~ 

stage that showcases all sorts of 
acts - from rock to punk to 
funk to unclassifiable. There are 
nachos and other goodies 
available. and the emphasis is 
on good times. One good thing 
to note. though , is that the 
Spirit features more than its 
share of out of town acts -
which is great. because San 
Diego doesn't have that many 
good bands. 

The Bacchanal is a lot like the 
Spirit. but features in addition 
quite a few more major acts. 
some of which are not all that 
danceable. 

The Distillery Nightclub is 
less eclectic. and hosts more 
mainstream acts,a well-stocked 
bar. and yet another stimu lating 

IT 

The Headquarters Nightclub 
is more of an underage "k iddy" 
place, catering to a younger 
crowd who do not mind bad 
acoustics or zilcho atmospere, 
Here. the music's the whole 
show. whether it be a rock night 
with live bands or a soul night 
with a OJ. 

The Distillery East has an 
interior that must be seen to be 
believed. It's a cooper's wet 
dream. Pretty wide age and 
music range. too. This place has 
a bar that is not always 
functionable. 

Now we come to my 
underdog favorites. the more 
adventuresome venues. 
Foremost of these is the King's 
Road Cafe. the great final refuge 
for much of San Diego's 
underground' scene:' The place 

i~ '>mall and a bit dingy. but the 
atmo~phere makc!> up for it. It 
features !)ome acts that you will

including real (but unrcal. if yo II

An issue now vigorously debated by philosophers is whether religion 
forms a separate conceptual domain with its own criteria of meaning

or interpret religion by any form of scientific method. even when 
broadly construed, are misguided. The course will investigate the

" When I am playing I am 

singing. I don't mean that I play 
through the songs and also sing 
the vocal line though of course I 
do do that to examine the text, 
hear phrases. and so forth. I 
mean that the sound ofthe lute 
is so close and it comes from a 
plucked string so that I feel I 
must energize each note and so I 
find I am always singing it 
inside. This is why I love to do 
these works with Carol - we 
breathe together, we phrase 
together. " explains musician 
Jurgen Hubscher. 

Lutenist Hubscher will 
perform with soprano Carol 
Plantamura in a program of 
songs and instrumental music 
notable for its examination of 
the diversity and intensity of 
human love Saturday night.

Hubscher has already visited 
here on his own at the invitation 
of the American Lute Seminar. 
He is passionately devoted to 
playing and researching the 
lute. Though he began his 
musical studies as a guitarist. 
he chose to become a lutenist 
because of J.S. Bach 's Suites

that thc Italian baroque would

should fit them comfortably

lovesick swain and an 
anonymous poet's world-weary

silent cross, " How can I live if 
you die? " 

Jurgen Hubscher and Carol Flantamura will perfonn togetber in concert

Surrealism and sensuality done Hubscher lute and 
by 3's Company group here friday Plantamu~a Saturday 

3's Company and Dancers will 
open Its second season 
subscription series at 
Mandeville Auditorium on 
friday and Saturday at 8 p.m, 
with the premiere of the 'The 
House of Bernarda Alba". 

Based on the Garcia Lorca 
classic about women whom love 
brings to tragedy, the theme of 
" 8ernarda Alba" is woven 
around the Spanish term, 
"duende". Although the term is 
not literally translatable into 
English, Lorca has defined it as, 
"All that has dark sounds ... This 
'mysterious power that 
everyone feels but that no 
philospher has explained', is in 
fact the spirit of the earth .. .A1I 
one knows is that it bums the 
blood like powdered glass, that 
it exhausts, that it r~ects all the 
sweet geometry one has 
learned .. :' 

Artistic director, Jean Isaacs, 
who holds a cum laude degree In 
Spanish literature, has 
choreographed "The House of 
Bernarda Alba". The movement 
is set to George Crumb's 
Pulitzer prize-winning "Ancient 
Voices of Children" which was 
inspired by Lorca's poetry. 

Patrick Nollet will premiere 
an as yet untitled work set in 
silence. Nollet describes his new 
choreography as an intensely 
personal work. The trio for two 
men and a woman opens with 
the unclad dancers depicting 
the innocence of the newborn 

child In photo-like images. 
Nollet assumes the role of the 
central persona,

and William Hansen portrays 
the "shadow" or dark side. The 
entire work is set in a surreal 
world of dream imagery and its 
dramatic representation of 
sexuality.

are $7 and $9 for general 
admission and $5 and $7 for 
students and seniors. Telephone 
reservations can be made by

continued from page S 
octave. Also the voice-leading 
of the lute works is necessarily 
mangled when they are played 
on the guitar:' He soon came to 
appreciate other characteristics 
of the lute - its intimate tone, 
its internal resonances which 
match those of the human voice 
so closely, eve n the 
mathematical complexities of 
certain aspects of its 
construction. 

Scholars have traced the lute 
and such procedures as the 
various tuning methods 
employed for the instrument to 
an Arabic ancestor, the oud. 
Hu bscher vividly recalls a 
meeting with a contemporary 
oud player at a recent master 
class. " We met and improvised 
together for hours. It was 
fantastic'" As he talks he moves 
his large, strong hands in the 
air, sketching people, music, 
and expressions. 

Continuing on the sul?ject of 
improVisation he speaks of the 
extraordinary freedom given to 
the lutenist by composers of 
such songs as those which will 
be heard Saturday. " Most otten, 
I am given one note, the bass, 
and one number from which 
must come all the chords, 
melodies, and other figures 
which make up my part. All of 
that music must come from the 
tradition, my training, and 
finally, my own taste. " He 

mentions as an example a 
Frescobaldi Toccata on the 
program which was written to 
be played either on the spinetto, 
an early keyboard, or on the 
lute. The bass line will be played 
by UCSD faculty gambist Peter 
Farrell while Hubscher 
embellishes the melody line and 
harmonizes the whole. 

After hearing recordings the 
two performers had made 
together, Robert Erickson wrote 
his piece for them. The 
Postcards are from Paris, Venice 
and other memorable places in 
Europe. Erickson used his own 
texts and says of them, "They 
may not be very nourishing as 
poetry, but they fit the music: ' 
The composer has said that 
Hubscher should treat his part 
like one that might be found in 
the literature of early baroque 
music and interpolate trills, 
arpeggios, and other ornaments 
according to his style. It is not 
clear whether these interpola-
tions would be fixed in the 
written notation of the work or 
lett to be devised by each 
individual performer. 

Tickets for the 8 p.m. 
Mandeville Show are available 
at the UCSD Central Box Office 
and at the door the evening of 
the concert. General admission 
costs $1.50: students pay only 
$1.00. For more information

Sheehan's "Pippin" breaks new 
ground in video film industry 

By JOHN Nr:f:" 
Pippin, David Sheehan 'S 

video production of the play by 
the same name, was given yet 
another in its series of "pre-
world release" screenings 
recently at the Old Globe. 
Actually this was not the first 
showing to grace this area. The 
video played for a run at SDSU. 

In short, Pippin is a musical 
comedy about the son of 
Charlemagne (Pippin) and his 
search for fulfillment. The 
storyline follows Pippin through 
his times just atter finishing 
school up unto his realization 
that his desire was being 
obscured by his own obsession 
to be fulfilled. Ultimately. by 
turning his back on his peers 
and going with the woman that 
he loves he finds happiness. 

What makes Pippin really 
work is a combination of four 
things. Individually they are Ben 
Vereen, David Sheehan, Bob 
Fosse and the PJ5050. Together 
they are the driving forte 
behind the production. 

For those not familiar with 
who or even what a PJS050 is, a 

brief summary is in order. The similar project on film would

format. While the quality of the 
system is good it does not 
match that of film. 

The major advantage though 
of using video is the cost. 
Sheehan put Pippin toghether 
for about three million dollars. 
This in itself is impressive. 
According to Sheehan, " a

another, Sheehan used nine

New film series for the "birdsll 
Beginning Tuesday, a new 

film series will get under way on 
campus with Jean -Luc 
Goddard's critically acclaimed 
film Breathless. 

The Penguin Film Society, an 
AS sponsored student 
organization, will be presenting 
classic films beginning oct. 5 
and will continue every Tuesday 
at USB 2722. 

The series will bring movies 
with the likes of Orson Wells, 
Spencer Tracy, W.e. Fields, 
Marilyn Monroe and other greats 
of the screen in some of the film 
industry's best classics. Says 
Penguin's vice president. IHana 
Saunders, " When we say classic 
we aren't speaking in terms of 
box office success, but in terms 
of their influence upon the film 

o 0 

industry itself." 
Penguin's president Michael 

Litt adds, " Ideally we'd like to 
develope something similar to 
the Dartmouth film series. They 
are in a position to show some 
of the best work of 
co ntemporary actors and 
directors from an international 
selection:' 

Although the film series itself 
is free, the Penguin Film Society 
is soliciting members to 
support the series. The one-time 
membership fee is five dollars 
and includes a society T-shirt 
and a membership card. And as 
Litt says, " It isn't necessary to 
be a member, the films are free 
to everyone. The membership is 
going to keep the series {ree this 
fall. If we can generate enough 
support now by the winter 
quarter UCSD could ha\'e its 
own fully funded film series, '

of production criticism that 
made him realize that Pippin 
would work, He feels that he 
"has a feeling for talent. " On a 
gamble Sheehan left his 
position at CBS in order to 
pursue a production career, He 
mortgaged his house to help 
cover the costs of Pippin, 
Jokingly, he said recently, "I 
was beginning to wonder 
whether or not it was worth it 
when the house went. then the 
car and even my cat and fish," 

On the stage Ben Vereen and 
Bob Fosse are what make the 
production what it is, Vereen in 
his role of " the Leading Player" 
is the most powerful member of 
the cast. Even on video his 
tremendous surplus of energy 
flows into the audience, the 
choreography by Fosse is 
outstanding, He seems so 
familiar with the capacities of 
the human body that he can 
cause his dancers to go beyond 

their own restrictions and rise 
to their ultimate potential. 

Both Fosse and Vereen have a 
history of lnvolvment together, 
They worked on Sweet Charity, 
Vereen 's original intentions for 
auditioning for Pippin were to 
show Fosse how he had grown as 
an artist " When I got the part" 
said Vereen, 'I wept. I honestly 
wept. All my lines were Enter 
Catherine, that's it. " The end 
product that we see was the 
resu I t of a colla boration 
between Fosse and Vereen, 
When describing the role of 
'The Leading Player" he said, 
' Anyone can play this role---
anyone with talent that is." 

All in all Pippin is well on the 
better side of good. It is worth 
seeing at least once for the 
experience of a great play 
immortalized; and another time 
to study the impact that video 
will have on big screen 
entertainment.

Coryell and friends miss on 
trans-continental musical trip 

By TED BURKE 
The joining of Eastern and 

Western musical styles has. in 
the past. produced its share of 
inspiring collaborations. a 
claim that's well sUbstaniated 
when one thinks ofthe efforts of 
Ravi Shankar and violinist 
Yehudi Menuhin in 1967. or 
more recently. guitiarlst John 
McLaughlin's efforts with 
ShaM!. 

In these. and other examples 
one may mention. the results 
have fused different modes of 
improvisation. harmony. and 
rhythmic value into a new. 

rivetting whole. maintaining 
the best aspects of both and yet 
not compromising the other's 
integrity in the slightest. That. 
however. is what comes when 
inspiration guides the intent. 

A recent attempt at such a 
mixture. last Saturday night 
with violinist L Subramaniam. 
guitarist Larry Coryell. and 
flautist Paul Hom. reached no 
such peaks. Not that there was 
anything horribly amiss with 
the capabilities of the 
musicians - their reputations 
collectively produce an 
impressive resume - but only. 

let us say. that an element of 
passion was lacking. and that 
the concert. over-all. seemed a 
mite academic. 

Starting nearly an hour late of 
its scheduled start. the night 
was divided into two portions. 
the first consisting of solo 
performances by the musicians. 
and the second section being 
t he three playing in an 
ensemble. 

The first. Paul Hom. proferred 
a series of flute solos. 
improvising at will on no set 
melodic structure. but rather 
blending cadences. points of 

nuance and tonal structure 
which combined a superb 
technical facility with the soul 
of a serene lyric imagination. 
Horn. best known for an album 
he produced in the Sixties titled 
Inside wherein he improvised, 
unaccompanied, in the dome of 
the Taj Mahal (and making 
brilliant usage ofthat building's 
famed echoing acoustics). this 
night employed an echo delay 
device, a gadget that let him 
extempori ze over phrases , 
scales and passages he had 
played seconds earlier. Usually a 
cheap gimmick in the hands of 
Tim Weisberg or Ian Anderson 
(of Jethro Tull). the echo device 
was retrieved from its inherant 
banality by Horns' subtlety and 
grace. 

Subtldv and grace. on the 

other hand. are rare adjectives 
to describe Larry Coryell. the 
second soloist. A guitarist with 
infinite knowledge and facility 
on his instrument. Coryell has, 
in his twenty plus years of 
professionalism, made some of 
the most brillian jazz guitar 
music imaginable (Offering. 
Spaces, Barefoot Boy). 

However, his career has been 
pockmarked by an inexplicable 
erraticism, too often yielding 
albums that has him sounding 
undecided as to whether he 
wants to be a loud rock-and-
roller or ajazz technician. To his 
credit. Coryell has salvaged 
some of his reputation by 
recording almost exclusively 
with an acoustic guitar. an 
instrument whose inherent 
properties frees the urge to 
jugernaut his way through a solo 
with a bombast of speed and 
electronic garble. 

following his better 
instincts, Coryell performed on

It must ha\(' sermed like d 

good idea to someon: a 
Saturday afternoon-long 
concert featuring the 10tels. 
the Greg Kihn Band and a full 
handfull of Sail Diego groups, 
outdoors in the "sunshine" al 
the Del Mar Race Track, a good 
place to show offand maybe win 
a few fans. 

The ensuing e\'ent certainly 
didn 't resemble the US festival. 
but then, this one didn't lose as 
much money, although it did 
lose at least its fair share. And 
that wasn't sunshine falling on 
everyone as the show was

Motels and 
rain at Del 
Mar concert 
continued from page 9 
music. 

Dirk Debonaire, , , well. I 
guess every community with at 
least a semblance of a sense of 
humor has its Dirk Debonaire, In 
Anchorage, Alaska, it's Mr, 
whitekeys and the Fabulous 
Spamtones (no, I'm not making 
this up), in the North County it·s 
Dirk himself. Debonair e 
intersperses dancible rock 
covers with his own songs, 
which are filled with local color 
- or, more often, local off-
color. 

The Monroes put on an 
amazingly professional show, a 
performance as slick as one by 
namesake Earl the Pearl. Their 
songs didn't generally make 
much of an impression, but 
singer Tony Ortiz - who, as 
someone noted, looked like a 
bearded John Belushi - had his 
crowd-rousing routines down 
pat. 

And then, as Chrissie Hynde 
might put it. came The Wait. 
Three unexplained hours, 
although the reason was that 
they didn 't sell enough tickets 
to pay the headliners, The small, 
mostly teenaged crowd banged 
on metal seats and lit popcorn 
boxes on fire, but all that 
brought on was fog and a light 
rain. 

Finally, the Greg Kihn Band 
came out and made the crowd 
forget about the weather. Kihn. 
sort of a Bay Area Bob Seger. has 
journeyman rocker credentials 
but his heart and his spirit are in 
the right place, 

The Motels closed out the 
proceedings at 10 p.m, with a 
moisture-shortened set. The 
Motels are an enjoyable group in 
a si lIy, pretentious (both 
unintentional, of course) sort of 
way. and in concert they at least 
play wioth more energy than on 
their albums, Singer Martha 
Davis set the tone with her 
affected singing and posing.

stage at the end of the closing

Coryell and friends 
continued from page 8-
a twelve -s tring guitar . 
beginning in the Spanish vein. 
winding through a dizzying 
array of chord voicings. scales 
and tempos. At times playing as 
though he had too much coffee 
(or something more potent), he 
none the less displayed ample 
muscle and knOW-how. rocking 
back and forth in h is seat while 
his fingers demonstrated their 
dexterity and executed their 
assigned intricacies with the 
verve of a virtuostic ham whose 
completely aware of just how 
good he or she happens to be. 

His piece. a rendition of 
Ravel's .. Bolero". was equally 
intended to show Coryells' 
breadth, but for all the bravura, 
the player in this case 
maintained a delicacy, a touch 
of the velvet hand, that's too 
seldom been a trademark of his 
playing. 

The third solo stint by l. 
Subramaniam (accompanied by 
a tibia player whose name. 
sadly. eludes me). was the most 
impressive in regards of 
someone knowing precisely 
what they wanted to get across 
t.o an audience. 

Instead, once started, the 
musicians established rich 
colors and textures, dispatched 
beats and note values. and then 
segued into spirited, lightning 
fast lines that were punctuated 
with sparkling drone effects, 
The interplay between 
Subramaniam and his tabla 
player was excellent. hinting at 
the kind of instrumental 
intimacy most people in the 

Western world would only 
associ ate with the best 
moments of a jazz band 's jazz 
jam session. Subramanium is a 
virtuoso of the first magnitude, 
and one can only expect to hear 
more. much more. from him, 

As nicely as the first portion 
of the concert had built. the 
second half. when the three 
players were to play together, 
seemed to dissipate the energy, 
The three of them seemed like 
three strangers who'd been 
shanghaid off the streets and 
who were being forced at 
gunpoint to have an intimate 
conversation. Needless to say. 
their was communication. but 
the walls between the three were 
never broken down, let alone 
scaled, 

Let us say that the 
intercourse between them was 
dry, Granted, each performed 
adequately and each in tum 
gave solo that IVould do anyone 
else proud. but yet on came 
with a feeling that the common 
ground was never firm Iy 
established. that only a vague 
idea had been kicked around 
briefly beforehand as to what 
they would do together. and 
that hazy notion was made to 
suffice as a premise for a 
concert. Impressive as the 
individual musicianship was, 
what was derived was a round-
robin of sorts that skittered 
aound Easter-tinged themes 
that never really came to the 
heart of what the project 
promised: a commun ication 
between indigenous musical 
notions and cultures.

BY MIKE GREENBE RG 
The major hangup in the 

strike by the National Football 
League Players Association is 
that neither side is interes ted 
in the most logical of all 
solutions-free agency. You 
remember free agency. don't 
you? That IS the method by 
';vhlch baseball and basket ball 
playr" ha\e gotten nch in 
recent ,ears. reapIng the 
benefits ilf spinted bidding for 
theIr ~er\lces 

The J.lla~·ers are in lamr (II 
free agency, hut haH' not Ix'en 
able ro estnhlish II in I he ~FL 
becau ~e t he head of t hell' 
union, Ed Gan'e\, l'ial!l1s frtoc 
agency wouldn't wurk in 
foot ball 

The owners are agaInst Ire<: 
agency because it would cost 
t hem money They are seekIng 
to retain the re ... trictl\ e 
compensat lOin rules in the 

agr~ment t hat expIred J ulv 
15th, . 

There "penflc e\ldencc to 
refute Ganey\ theory that 
free agenc} wouldn't work . In 
the la"t three years. three 
players (Tom Cousinea, 
Renaldo NehemIah, and Eric 
Harris)' have been a\ ai lable on 
an open market in the NFL. In 
each case. they negotiated 
ext remely generous con tracts. 
So. contrary to what Garve~ 
ays. the only conclUSIon that 

can be reached is that the 
owners would bid for free 
agents. 

It is worth noting that in all 
three of the cases. the big 
spender: were from relatively 
small TV markets-Houston, 
Cleveland. an Francisco, 
New Orleans. and Kansas 
City. One concJu,>ion that can 
be draw n from this e\ Idence I" 
that the NFL 's "harc-the-
\\ ealt h phIlosophy, ral her 
Ihan inhlbltInglhe bidding for 
free agmls, as Can'ey claims, 
w01lld acl uallv enhance it. All 
of 1 he pro t'cams (w 1'0 arc 
guaranleed mort' than I.l 
million a flil'Cl' l'\'l'n \'l'ar fur 
the next fi\c \ears) are 
economically stron'g cnough to 
afford high paid players. In 
baseball and basket ball, the 
same is not truc. becau'>e both 
of them ha\'e far less lucrat l\e 
TV contracts and son't share 
as much of t he revenue. 

A ... In other "ports. most of 
the mega·bucks would go to 
"uper"t ars If t he foot ball 
players had free agenc~ But 
wit hout Ed Garvey \, support. 
NFL free agency i'> not lIkely to 
pass. 

Football player~ are 
underpaId. expenence short 
careers (a\'erage length is 4.6 
years). and are under the 
constant threat of mjury.

Random Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG a nd JEFF SAVAGE 

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Ever watch college sports 
on T.V.? Thou sand of delirious students cheering their team on 
to victory, Wouldn't that be nice if we had that kind of 
excitement here at UCSD? fl is a shame thal the administration 
here doe n't think so. Be ides the fact that this school does not 
offer scholars hip or even partial scholarhsips to potential 

~t udent athletes (in a n effort to lure the blue-chippers from the 
big time schools). the administrat ion' s commitment to keeping 
quality cuaches is suspect. Apparently the administration 
thinks ele\en huurs a wcek of coachi ng is sufficie nt to produce a 
winner. IJnI')(.' li evahly, a coach \\ ho works beyond the cle\cn

WA!T A 1\11 TE DEPT. A San Francisco 4ger execul ive 
called Walter Cronkite one night 111 his hotel room while he was 
on assignment in San Francisco. Apparently. this partIcular 
executive wanted 10 inform Mr. Cronkite that a league rule \\ as 
instated recent Iy in football and baseball which prohibits 
spectators to be allowed on the field during 4gers and Giants 
games. Thus. his . on Bobby would be unable to watch the games 
on the field like he had done previous ly for the past two years, 
but luxury box accomodations would be available to him free of 
charge. Cronkite found all ofthis quite amus ing. ince hedoesn't

about the game, and they 
didn't make much noise at all.
