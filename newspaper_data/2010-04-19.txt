Minority 
Admit
Rate Up 7 
Percent

By Ayelet Bitton
Associate News Editor

The number of students admit-
ted from underrepresented races 
to UCSD for Fall Quarter 2010 
increased dramatically since last 
year, according to statistics released 
by the UC Office of 
the President last 
week. The admis-
sions office accept-
ed 16.6 percent — 
or 3,041 — more 
black, Hispanic 
and American-
Indian students out 
of the total admit 
pool, a 6.9-percent 
increase from last 
fall.

It was also a 
record year for 
overall applications 
and admits: 48,073 
students applied, 
compared to last 
year’s 47, 708, and  
the total number of 
students admitted 
increased by 3.7 percent, or 655 stu-
dents. The overall admissions rate was 
36.8 percent, down from 38 percent in 
2009. A total of 18,334 students were 
admitted.

There was a rise in the num-
ber of minority applicants this year, 
but Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions Mae Brown said she 
attributes the higher admit rate to 
the university’s augmented publicity 
and outreach efforts.

“We experienced an increase in 
applications during the November 
filing period, which included under-
represented students,” Brown said in 
an e-mail. “We visited high schools, 
participated in college fairs and 
used technology to extend our reach 
throughout the fall recruitment peri-
od. We are very excited about our 
increase in applications.”

A.S. Campuswide Senator and 
Black Student Union board member 
Desiree Prevo said the BSU has made 
recruitment community outreach a 
priority. This year, the BSU sent out a 
“Black Book” to black admits detailing 
cultural outlets on and off campus.

The student-run co-operatives at 
UCSD have begun redrafting their 
rent agreement with the university 
in hopes of reducing their monthly 
payments to a more sustainable level.

Representatives from the co-ops 
— including the Che Cafe Collective, 
the UCSD Food Co-operative, 
Groundwork Books and the UCSD 
General Store Co-operative — 
recently decided to request that they 
no longer be required to pay rent for 
their on-campus spaces. 

Though they said that this is still 
the ultimate goal of negotiations with 
the administration, the focus of their 
April 16 meeting with Director of 
University Centers Paul Terzino, A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta and Graduate 
Student Association President Alex 
James shifted instead to simply low-
ering their rent. 

All those present at the meeting 
agreed it was time to redraft the rent 
contract between the co-ops and the 
university. 

Co-op representatives also 
requested that their Master Space 
Agreement be reworded to define 
them as student organizations rather 
than businesses. This request, they 
said, is in response to financial hard-
ship the co-ops fell into following a 
remodeling of the Student Center 
and the opening of Price Center.

James said the co-ops believe their 
current rental rates are negatively 

A potential pay-as-you-
can policy would allow 
the student co-ops a 
chance to get back on 
their feet.

In case you failed to notice the giant three-quarter ad page dedicated to lit-erature professor Rae Armantrout on 
page six, hear it now: She’s become quite the 
celebrity.

Just last week, the San Diego native was 
awarded the 2010 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry, 
along with $10,000. The honor was a grand 
finale to the heap of praise she has received 

for “Versed,” her tenth volume of poetry, 
published in 2009. It also received the 2009 

National Book Critics Circle Award, and was a 
finalist for the 2009 National Book Award.

Divided into two parts — “Versed” and 
“Dark Matter” — the 87-poem assortment 

is typical of Armantrout’s work: cognitive, com-
pressed and acute. Armantrout wrote the latter part 
after being diagnosed with adrenal cortical cancer 
— or cancer of the adrenal gland — in June 2006.  

Sixty-three-year-old Armantrout said she was 
surprised to hear she’d won a Pulitzer — especially 
on the day before her April 13 birthday.

“So far, it is amazingly exciting,” Armantrout 
said. “It’s really not something I expected.  Of 
course, I thought about winning things, but the 
Pulitzer was not one of them — that was just like a 
bolt from the blue.”

Since her win, Armantrout has been flooded with 
congratulations and media attention, including a 
front-page feature in the San Diego Union-Tribune.

University attributes 
increase in minority 
applications to bolstered
outreach programs.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta has recruited university officials to pitch in for a 
consultant to evaluate moving 
sports teams to Division-I and the 
possibility of starting a football team 
at UCSD.

Together, Gupta — along with 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue and Director of Athletics Earl 
Edwards — hired consultant Carl 
McAloose from Athletics Staffing 
and Consulting — a company that 
specializes in advising universities 
on the development of their athletics 
programs.

McAloose will begin work this 
quarter analyzing the university’s 
budget and determining if either D-I 
or football is feasible. If so, he will 
then estimate how much it would 
cost to implement either plan.

The $28,000 McAloose is charg-
ing for his services will be split evenly 
among A.S. Council, the chancellor’s 
fund, the vice chancellor 
of student affair’s fund 
and the athletics depart-
ment, according to Gupta.

“We are getting a 
good deal with this con-
sultant,” Gupta said “We 
have debated the issue 
of Division-I sports and 
a football team every 
year I have been on A.S. 
[Council], and now we 
will actually find out the 
costs of these things.” 

He praised the partner-
ship between the council 
and the university depart-
ments involved in hiring 
McAloose. According to 
Gupta, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox was the first to suggest 
splitting the cost of hiring a consul-
tant.

“We have set up an amazing part-
nership with the administration so 
that A.S. [Council] is really only pay-

ing one-fourth of the total costs,” 
Gupta said. “It is an unprecedented 
level of partnership.”

Chancellor Fox said she was will-
ing to help pay for the 
consultant in order to 
explore all options on 
the table for the athletics 
department.

“Intercollegiate ath-
letics are an important 
part of the college expe-
rience for our students,” 
she said in an e-mail. “UC 
San Diego has grown 
over the last 50 years to 
become one of the top 
public universities in the 
nation; this is an oppor-
tunity to explore taking 
UC San Diego athletics 
to the next level as well.”

Fox added that the 
consultant’s findings will 

determine whether the administration 
is interested in putting money or time 
into a football team or move to D-I. 

“The purpose of contracting with 
a consultant is to provide the campus 
with research and recommendations 

regarding the feasibility of making a 
move from Division-II to Division-I 
athletics and the optimal mix of 
sports, based on the size, resources 
and fundraising capabilities of the 
university,” Fox said. “The consul-
tant’s findings will inform decision 
about any future steps.”

The $7,000 cost paid by the A.S. 
Council will be taken from enterprise 
income: money generated by council-
owned businesses, such as A.S. Soft 
Reserves and A.S. Lecture Notes.

The results of the consultant’s 
study will be renewed by the 2010-11 
A.S. Council, which will then decide 
whether to pursue the issue. The new 
council will take office Week Seven of 
this quarter.

Campuswide Senator and A.S. 
President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine said 
that she was in favor of hiring the con-
sultant, as well as the proposal to move 
the UCSD athletics program to D-I.

“I do support the passage of leg-
islation for the $7,000,” Ben Hassine 
said. “There has been a lot of debate 
about football and Division-I sports, 
so it will be nice to see if these options 
are possible.”

However, she said she would not 
support the creation of a football team, 
even if the consultant determined the 
idea was financially feasible.

“I am against forming the foot-
ball team right now, because I don’t

A new study shows sleep depriva-
tion in humans can reduce the effects 
of clinical depression. The study sug-
gests that there may be an upside to 
the overworked, under-rested lifestyle 
so common among college students.

Clinical depression is a medical 
condition that affects nearly 6 percent 
of the U.S. population. Symptoms 
include a decrease in self-esteem, 
liveliness and the ability to carry out 
daily tasks. 

According to various cases — ana-
lyzed in more than 75 papers over the 
last 40 years, if a victim of depression 
stays up all night, or even just half the 
night, symptoms of depression tend 
to disappear for the rest of the day. 

In particular, mothers who have 
forgone a day of sleep have reported 
that the symptoms of postpartum 
depression — a common condition 
that develops during the first few 
months after childbirth — are dimin-
ished. 

The late UCSD professor J. 
Christian Gillin used brain-imaging 
technology to search for the sleep-
depression link.

By studying brain scans of patients 
before and after being deprived of 
sleep, he found that an area of the 
brain in the cerebral cortex called the 
anterior cingulate cortex was over-
active in depressed patients. After 
being deprived of sleep, however, the 
patients demonstrated normal levels 
of activity in the ACC.

Helen Mayberg, a researcher at 

Emory University, furthered Gillin’s 
research by electronically stimulat-
ing the anterior cingulate cortex in a 
group of patients. When the patients 
were sleeping, the stimulation inter-
rupts normal brain activity by discon-
necting the cortex from the sensory 
input.  This reduced the symptoms of 
depression among test subjects. 

Electrical stimulation may provide 
those patients with the treatment they 
need.

“For some people, the benefits are 
miraculous,” Sejnowski said.

According to Gillin, sleep depriva-
tion is relatively safe. It’s side effects 
are similar to those of other antide-
pressant treatments, like medication 
or bright light. However, more major 
risks of overnight sleep deprivation 
are mania in bipolar patients and 
seizures in patients with a history of 
convulsions. 

In addition, patients cannot be 
deprived of sleep on a regular basis, 
as that could create hazardous situa-
tions. Accoridng to Gillin,  operating 
a vehicle without having slept is as 
dangerous as driving drunk.

Although sleep deprivation may 
seem like a quick home remedy for 
depression, long-term side effects  can 
include irritability, hallucinations and 
memory lapses.

“Long-term deprivation of sleep 
is really a dangerous thing,” Terry 
Sejnowski, principle investigator for 
the Computational Neurobiology 
Laboratory at the Salk Institute, said. 

“Although we don’t understand 
why we sleep, we know for sure that it 
is essential, in that sleep deprivation 
[has] led to serious accidents,” he said.

Many questions about sleep 
— such as why some animals sleep 
less than others, or why we sleep a 
certain amount each day — are still 
unknown to researchers. 

“The biggest surprise is that 
we still don’t know why we sleep,” 
Sejnowski said.

He added that he hopes technol-
ogy will advance to allow depressed 
patients to be treated with electrical 
stimulation in the future.

TALKING POINTS

After a com-petitive 
Associated 
Students cam-
paign season, 
A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta 
and A.S. 
President-elect 

Wafa Ben Hassine sat down with 
the Guardian to discuss some major 
issues and controversies the council 
faced this year, and those it may 
face in 2010-11.

The two also commented on 
what they think the responsibili-
ties of councilmembers — in par-
ticular, the president — should 
be. Ben Hassine said she envisions 
a council with a greater focus on 
external efforts, such as lobbying 
Sacramento to fight student-fee 
increases. Gupta, however, said 
he believes the council should 
concentrate primarily on internal 
efforts — ensuring the $3 million 
that students pay into the council 
ends up serving their best interests. 

Other topics included the possi-
bility of opening 
an A.S. store 
in Price Center 
East, which Ben 
Hassine said 
would allow 
students to sell 
items such as 
“sweatshirts 
with Greek 
letters, organi-
zational T-shirts, sustainable pens 
[and] sustainable bottles.”

Gupta was more wary of the 
financial burden such an undertak-
ing would present. He pointed out 
that the initial investment might be 
as much as $100,000. 

For two councilmembers who, 
only one week prior, were compet-
ing in a hotly contested race for the 
same post, Gupta and Ben Hassine

the transition as smooth as possible

STUDENT COUNCIL

Guardian: I’d like to start this discussion by address-
ing the office of the president specifically. Utsav, 
every A.S. president has a different idea in mind 
for what role the council should play. In your mind, 
what should the role of an A.S. president be here on 
campus?
Utsav Gupta: I think the primary role for the A.S. 
president is to represent the undergraduate interests to 
the best of his or her ability to the general 
campus. In a lot of ways, we represent a 
funnel where we have the administration 
here at the top, students here at the bot-
tom. The only real connection they have is 
the Associated Students, and it’s primarily 
a position where you refer information 
back and forth and try to move the student 
interest forward. 
Wafa Ben Hassine: I also believe that the 
office of the president, in particular, is 
kind of a channel between students and 
the administration. It holds responsibil-
ity to council that’s ensuring that council 
is on the same page, and that we have 
good working relations with outside relations besides 
Associated Students. It’s showing the general population 
of students working together and having fun on this 
campus. 
G: Utsav, you have taken a bit of criticism for alleg-
edly going around the council and pursuing your 
own agenda — maybe going around the council, via 
your own staff that you built up around you within 
the office of the president. How do you respond to 
that kind of criticism? 
UG: In regard to the staff of the president, I think that 
this is the first year where we’ve actually had a real staff 
working on specific projects and goals within the office 
of the president. In terms of going around council, 
there is no real way to go around council. I would ask 
for a specific example where we’ve been able to move 
around council in some way or another. The staff was 
working mostly on policy shifts and how to reach out 
to administrators, bringing policies forward to council, 

doing background research work, driving policies with 
approval from council, researching policies to ensure 
we bring the best-educated decisions to council.
G: Are there any projects started this year in particu-
lar that you would like to pursue next year?
WBH: There are quite a few. One of the ones that was 
recently brought up by Tobias Haglund was the A.S. 
store. I personally have not worked on it, but this year 

he’s been doing a lot of research on it. 
It’s an exciting idea, where students can 
share what they have and sell to the 
general public if they want — sweat-
shirts with Greek letters, organizational 
T-shirts, sustainable pens, sustainable 
bottles. It’s something I’m definitely 
excited about. We went over the brief 
business plan that he made up, and I’m 
looking forward to that. 
UG: A.S. store would be an investment, 
and an investment that the council has 
to decide whether to make. Next council 
will decide, given appropriate research 
and consideration. I would recommend 

to council next year to really take a close look at the 
numbers and ensure that if we are creating an enter-
prise that it is profitable, and — if we don’t expect it to 
be profitable — whether it’s worth creating a new ser-
vice in form of a retail place. A.S. store would represent 
at least [a] three- to five-year commitment, and the 
one-time cost would be the largest form of cost, in the 
tens of thousands of dollars — potentially $100,000. 
G: While we’re on financial issues, let’s talk about 
the A.S. budget. Wafa: During your campaign, you 
discussed the idea of cutting wasteful spending. What 
are the things you currently want to address in put-
ting together your budget for next year?
WBH: I don’t know what could be wasteful at this 
point. I haven’t formed a committee yet, but particular 
attention is to the Sun God Festival budget because it’s 
really big, and that’s a very big chunk of our $3 million.

Last week, after a long day of work, I came home with scalded toes.

That’s right, scalded toes. It’s a sen-
sation I never thought I would experi-
ence during my undergraduate career, 
but the life of a dining-hall employee 
is full of painful little surprises.

It goes without saying that my line 
of work isn’t very glamorous, but it 
can be amusing. Unfortunately, most 
students don’t know what dining-hall 
employees must endure to bring you 
the clean plate on which the vaguely 
Asian-style daily special is served.   

You’d never guess, but that spotless 
porcelain tray beneath your sandwich 
all started with an e-mail from my 
boss over spring break. It is a testa-

ment to my social life that — along 
with checking my grades — learning 
my work schedule for next quarter 
consumed my thoughts over vacation. 
All it took was a foray into my ACS 
mailbox to reveal my frightening fate: 
In the lottery of dining-hall assign-
ments, I had drawn the dish room.

I know, I know: Life is really what 
you make of it, and all that glass-
half-full crap. But after a long day of 
classes, it’s pretty much impossible to 
walk into a small room containing 
nothing but a swamp of greasy food 
scraps with a smile on your face. 

At the sight of the dish room, 
whatever shred of optimism I’d clung 
to before suddenly disintegrated. I 
trudged through the mustard-yellow 
doorway with head hung low, clad in 
a heavy hairnet. I couldn’t help it. All 
I could think about was the likelihood 
of one of my coworkers accidently 
gunning me with the wayward pres-
surized hose or me dousing myself in 
rancid hamburger water. 

But there was no time to waste: 
The constant flow of dirty dishes waits 
for no one. Not rain nor sleet nor 
apocalyptic earthquake can stop the 
gustatory flow of thousands of hungry 
college students. So I sucked it up and 
approached the most stubborn of dish 
room challenges: cleaning the pans 
of white rice. After a couple of hours 
in the cooker, the chemical structure 
of rice apparently forms a bond with 

“I don’t know 
what [council 
spending] could 
be wasteful at 
this point.

Dear Editor,

According to a recent study, the 
U.S. — which makes up 5 percent 
of the world’s population — houses 
25 percent of the world’s inmates. 
Our incarceration rate (714 per 
100,000 residents) is almost 40-per-
cent greater than that of our nearest 
competitors; it is 6.2 times that of 
Canada, 7.8 times that of France and 
12.3 times that of Japan. 

Of all the 50 states, California 
leads the way in incarceration, in 
large part due to its Three Strikes 
Law. There are still thousands of 
men and women serving life sen-
tences in California for petty, non-

violent drug-related crimes. 
Never before has a state denied 

basic liberty to so many of its citi-
zens. Two-thirds of the inmates in 
California’s prisons are there for 
property and drug-related offenses. 
The incarceration of nonviolent 
offenders continues to grow to this 
present day. 

Until the 1970s, the corrections 
system was commonly seen as a way 
to prepare offenders to rejoin society. 
But since then, the focus has shifted 
from rehabilitation to punishment. 

The new system of punitive ide-
als is aided by a new relationship 
between the media, politicians and 
the public. A handful of cases in 
which a predator does an awful thing 
to an innocent person receive exces-
sive media attention and engender 

public outrage. 
The attention typically bears 

no relation to the frequency of the 
particular type of crime, yet laws 
— such as California’s Three Strikes 
Law, which can give a mandatory life 
sentence to a nonviolent offender 
— are born, and political careers 
are made on the basis of the public’s 
reaction to media coverage of such 
crimes. 

California’s incarceration rates 
are out of control. The state prison 
system should not be allowed to con-
tinue to drain state assets for politi-
cal gains or ideologies while break-
ing the backs of the state’s education 
system and other human-resource 
organizations.

Dear Editor,

Recently, an article was published 
by UCLA English professor Robert 
N. Watson about the profitability of 
the humanities. Watson demonstrates 
that the humanities do, in fact, turn a 
profit through student fees, which is 
possible through low operating costs. 

The myth that the sciences 
typically bail out the humanities has 
been a recurring debate during the 
University of California’s current 
budget crisis, mentioned not only in 
public forums but also on television 
by UC President Mark G. Yudof. 
This is an important article Watson 
has written, and I think that it could 

only benefit the public discussion to 
bring this to light.

the metal pan. Something about the 
nature of the atoms involved. Being a 
literature major, I don’t quite under-
stand the logistics of this process, but 
hours of grimy, wet research on the 
subject have me convinced that the 
rice can only be removed from the 
pan by blowtorch. Or, of course, 10 to 
15 minutes of miserable manual labor. 

After diligently scraping away the 
superhuman sludge on a number of 
pots, pans, dishes and cups, I sent 
them through the dish machine. To 
awaken the dish machine every morn-
ing, one must push several buttons, 
pull a lever and plead for 20 minutes. 
The dish machine is a fickle mistress 
— and she must be kept happy. If 
you don’t load the dishes in properly, 

she will spit them into the gutter, and 
they will clog the conveyor belt. If 
you don’t pick up the clean dishes, the 
trays will pile up until she’s jammed 
and refuses to work any longer. And 
if you don’t keep your queen stocked 
with detergent, she’ll screech at you in 
pained hunger. The machine — even 
on good days — emits a cacophony of 
clanks, hums and buzzes. 

My only hope for sanity was blast-
ing AC/DC. At the end of the convey-
or belt is a shelf supporting my only 
form of refuge: a trusty boom box. So, 
as long as my coworkers aren’t look-
ing, I bang my head to Rise Against or 
practice my glide to R. Kelly. 

Sadly, this very same dance 
therapy was the cause of my poor little 
scalded toes. Apparently, steaming hot 

water was draining out of a spigot at 
the end of the dish machine, and had 
formed a steaming puddle right in the 
middle of my dance floor. As I slid 
my sneakered foot across the tile, hot 
water soaked through my shoe and 
seared my piggies. 

You’d think a machine spewing hot 
water on the floor would be proper 
cause for concern; my manager, how-
ever, insists it’s supposed to do that. To 
prevent future burns, she said, I should 
keep a bucket there. Sure thing, boss.

Eventually, the clock struck 10 
p.m. I took one last look at the dish 
room and tossed my dirty apron in 
its proper pile. I was done fighting 
chemical bonds and busting embar-
rassing moves in the dish room — at 
least for the day.

Last week, the U.S. Library of Congress officially Tweeted 
its plan to archive all Twitter.com 
records dating back to the site’s 
inception in 2006. Despite its hon-
orable intention to capture and 
preserve American culture as it is 
made, the records would infringe on 
personal privacy.

In the past, the Library of 
Congress has cataloged media like 
the first draft of the Declaration of 
Independence and historically sig-
nificant films and literature. Its move 
to permanently archive millions of 
personal updates  — often detailing 
trivial daily thoughts — also debases 
the significance of other, more his-
torical holdings. 

Whether Tweets regarding one’s 
personal life are involved or not, the 
potential litigation that could result 
from dissatisfied users should be 
enough for the Library of Congress to 
at least open up the issue to a public 
forum. 

Archiving the posts in the Library 
of Congress unjustly strips the site’s 
users of their ability to make posts 
visible only to users they’ve chosen, 
and to delete their accounts alto-
gether — instead making every last 
100-character rant indelible public 
property.

The announcement underscores 
the huge impact Twitter has had on 
American culture and communica-
tion. But having only just celebrated 
its fourth anniversary, Twitter has 
not stood the test of time and could 
eventually end up being just a passing 
fad — which the Library of Congress 
has no business in archiving.

Staff Writer

8ZQ^IKa�;PW]TL�<Z]UX�
8]JTQK�:MKWZL

The new plan to archive all Tweets is borderline ridiculous. The word 
“tweet” alone drags a nail-on-chalk-
board scratch across an institution of 
historical prestige. 

However, as useless as the project 
seems, it poses no real invasion of 
privacy. Whether publicizing their 

opinions on 
health-care 
reform or 
the number 
of times they 
can burp 
the ABCs, 
Twitter junk-
ies have full 
knowledge 
they’re hand-
ing over 

the rights to their daily musings to 
Twitter.com.

If Tweeters are willing to expose 
their innermost thoughts online, the 
Library isn’t crossing any new lines by 
using their stream of consciousness for 
good old-fashioned research.

It goes without saying that, most of 
the time, the grammatically obscene 
words of wisdom posted to the website 
— especially by our celebrity friends 
— fall in the category of meaningless 
gibberish. But, however superficial, the 
Twitter database is a telling chronicle 
of contemporary culture. There’s no 
harm in dusting off a corner in the 
country’s most highbrow library for 
the world’s least formal news outlet, 
especially when it comes to Internet 
phenomenons like the reaction to the 
Iranian election protests. Even if that 
also means constituting smart-phone 
bathroom updates as history.

A.S. PRESIDENCY CONTINUED FROM PAGE 4

One of the first things as president I 
will do is charge a committee to look 
at the budget and make sure we’re 
allocating our money, and where 
it’s going is where it’s being spent — 
like the Student Promoted Access 
Center for Education and Service, the 
Sustainability Resource Center, what 
have you — with programs that are 
being carried out. I want to make 
sure money’s being allocated wisely 
and appropriately to these different 
constituencies. 
G: So when you said you were 
going to cut wasteful spending 
throughout your campaign and 
endorsement interview, you weren’t 
referring to any specific line item 
or any specific spending? You were 
being general? 
WBH: I believe that we should look 
into if there is wasteful spending and 
eliminate it, because I do believe it’s 
part of institutionalizing activism, 
which is ensuring that the students’ 
fees are going to things and programs 
that benefit them — that we aren’t 
putting it to things that aren’t being 
carried out, or programs that look 
good on paper and don’t have general 
results coming out. I’ll charter a com-
mittee to look into that and see what 
in the budget might be useful. 
G: You mentioned responsible over-
allocation. In your mind, has there 
been any irresponsible over-alloca-
tion? How should the council fund 

media organizations, and should 
the council’s re-examination of the 
existing guidelines continue? Are 
media orgs being funded too much? 
For example, No. 15 magazine is 
getting $9,000 for one 3,000-print 
run. 
UG: When I talked about responsible 
over-allocation, I meant considering 

how much 
we’re going to 
over-allocate 
by sticking 
with the num-
bers through-
out the year. 
A.S. Council 
decided not 
to stick with 
the numbers 
we decided 
on, and that’s 

irresponsible over-allocation when 
you take line items such as the media 
orgs’ funding at $45,000 per year 
and decide to allocate an additional 
$20,000 over that. 

That is going to strip even more 
into the carryforward, and because of 
those specific actions, we may go into 
the negative for next year and dip 
into our reserve. I think that’s a dan-
gerous precedent to set — to continu-
ously over-allocate line items — and 
it’s one that’s going to come back and 
bite the council. If they want to allo-
cate $65,000 worth of media funding 

next year, where is that $20,000 going 
to come from? 
G: Wafa, you’ve voted on many of 
these allocations. In your mind, has 
there been any irresponsible over-
allocation?
WBH: Whatever the students pay 
into [the A.S. Council] should go 
back to them the year that they’re 
here at UCSD. I think it’s really 
important that we keep our level of 
mandate reserves and level of car-
ryforward in the minimum. Right 
now, it’s around $1 million, which is 
a third of our budget and quite a bit 
of money that’s not really necessary 
at this point. A lot of student orgs, 
multicultural orgs, what have you, all 
want more funding, and I do believe 
that we could allocate a little differ-
ently this year. The Vice President of 
Finance-elect Andrew Ang and I are 
thinking about increasing the stu-
dent-org operating funds from $400 
to maybe $600 or $800 — and this 
also depends on how we fit every-
thing else into the budget as well. 
G: What kind of financial planning 
goes into determining whether 
there’s going to be too much alloca-
tion taking place, to the point where 
you have to run another student 
referendum?
WBH: Doing the budget is — from 
what I know — it’s a balance of hav-
ing enough of mandate reserves and 
carryforward and a balance of not 

spending too much. And you want 
to try to avoid running referenda at 
all costs, but we’re actually in really 
good shape right now because our 
source of funding is guaranteed. And 
it’s quite a bit of money, so we have to 
make that distinction. 

You brought up media orgs 
— there are media-org guidelines that 
we aren’t really paying attention to, 
certain things like you have to fund 
20 percent of your printing through 
advertising, and I feel like we should 
look into those more in order to 
determine how media orgs are funded 
and how we allocate media funding. 
G: Would you be a proponent of 
putting a cap on media-org fund-
ing?
WBH: Not a cap, though it’s a possi-
bility. We should look into the guide-
lines more to ensure that we don’t 
overspend. 
G: The guidelines seem kind of arbi-
trary. It seems like it’s kind of up to 
the Student Org Funding Advisory 
Board and the associate vice presi-
dent of student organizations to 
determine what those recommenda-
tions are. 
WBH: The guidelines aren’t really 
arbitrary. They’re there, they’re just 
not being followed. I’ve talked to the 
VP finance now and VP finance-
elect, and there were mistakes that 
happened last year that we’ll try to 
avoid. If we’re obliged to put a cap on 

media orgs, we have to make sure we 
fund different orgs fairly, but maybe 
that’s an option we could consider. 
We need to revisit guidelines and 
ensure that we’re following them, 
which could mean that there’s a lot of 
research to be done into that before 
we formulate the budget this year. 
As president-elect, I’m meeting with 
people, discussing what they’d like to 
see in the budget, any recommenda-
tions — but that’s one thing in par-
ticular we should look into more than 
anything. There is no limit and that 
could be dangerous. 
G: I’d like to end on a slightly lighter 
note. Who are you looking forward 
to most at the Sun God Festival?
UG: Definitely Drake.
WBH: Michelle Branch. 

“We may go into the 
negative for 
next year.”

students.

“They had concerns that the funds they 
were paying the university was money that 
they could otherwise be putting back into 
the co-ops, to make the co-ops better,” James 
said.

Representatives at the meeting from 
the co-ops, the university, the A.S. Council 
and the GSA agreed to create a committee 
charged with drafting the new Master Space 
Agreement, which would dictate rent for the 
next two years. 

The committee will be comprised of 
two representatives from each organization 
except for the university, which will be repre-
sented solely by Terzino.

Until the committee drafts and finalizes 
the new MSA, the co-ops will continue to 
abide by the terms of their 2006 MSA. This 
agreement — which should have been rene-
gotiated in the 2008-09 school year, but was 
defaulted upon when the co-ops refused to 
sign an amendment to the contract — has 
two sets of guidelines built in.

The first set allows for a two-year lease, 
but is defined to only apply as long as the co-
ops continue their payment plan and agree 
to a new lease after the two years are up. 
Because the co-ops did not agree to the 2008-

09 contract, they fell back onto the second set 
of guidelines.

Under these secondary rules, the co-ops 
abide by a month-to-month pay plan — 
which they will continue to do until the new 
space agreement is drafted.

However, one of Terzino’s suggestions at 
the meeting was a pay-as-you-can policy, 
which would lessen the financial burden on 
the co-ops until a new agreement is worked 
out. According to Rubens, this means that 
if the co-ops do not have the funds to com-
pletely cover their rent, they will not be repri-
manded or evicted by the university.

The committee will continue to meet 
throughout Spring Quarter. James said the 
meeting on Friday did not produce a finite 
consensus about what would be done in 
response to the co-ops’ requests.

“The only official agreement that I heard 
in the last meeting was that we all agreed to 
have another meeting,” James said. “I hope we 
can get it done by the end of the year, because 
the whole constituency of the committee will 
change if it had to continue into next year — 
and that will complicate things a lot.”

The next meeting will take place on 
Friday, April 24.

believe it is fiscally responsible at the moment,” 
Ben Hassine said. “Regardless, a football team 
involves student fees. There is no way that there 
could be a football team created without stu-
dent fees, and I don’t agree with that.”

Ben Hassine added that the university 
should prioritize lowering the cost of education 
over acquiring a football team. However, she 
said she was in favor of moving current teams to 
D-I because it wouldn’t require as much money.

“We need to be investing in other things 
like scholarship programs and ensuring that 
students with UCSD degrees are able to find 
jobs later on,” she said. “I love football, and I’m 
not opposed to having a football team ever, I 

just don’t think it is the right time now. As for 
Division-I sports, I think it is great to have a 
consultant helping us see if that’s possible.”

Despite Ben Hassine’s reluctance to pursue 
a football team, Gupta said McAloose’s work is 
still valuable, because it will provide concrete 
financial projections for the university to review.

“I hope that [Ben Hassine will] at least give 
students a choice,” he said. “It’s an issue students 
care about, and it’s the role of the president to be 
flexible and not push personal opinions.”

“The Black Book is an African-American 
resource guide,” Prevo said. “We want to show 
them they have a community, rather than just the 
1.3 percent everyone publicizes.”

Prevo said the BSU also organized a Black 
Senior Weekend to coincide with admit day, allow-
ing black admits to spend more time exploring the 
campus, and experiencing life at UCSD firsthand.

This marks the first year UCSD implemented 
a waitlist in its admissions process, offering 1,165 
students the opportunity to remain on the list. 
According to Brown, the number of those students 
granted admission will depend on how many cur-
rent admits choose to enroll.

Brown said the waitlist will help the university 
more effectively control enrollment levels, allow-
ing for more students to be admitted should fewer 
enroll than originally projected.

“At this point, we are satisfied with the waitlist 
process,” Brown said. “From all indications, the 
UC system will continue to use the waitlist process 
for fall 2011.”

Last quarter, the BSU called for the university to 
change its admissions process from the traditional 
comprehensive review system — which evaluates 

applicants by assigning points to each compo-
nent of their application — to the holistic review 
process used by UC Berkeley and UCLA. The 
holistic review process evaluates an application 
in its entirety. Brown said the UCSD Committee 
on Admissions is responsible for investigating the 
new program.

“The faculty is responsible for developing and 
approving any changes in the admission policy,” 
Brown said. “At this point, the committee is cur-
rently conducting research and analysis on holistic 
review. In addition, several meetings are being 
planned to familiarize various faculty committees, 
student groups and staff with both holistic and 
comprehensive review processes.”

Brown said she is uncertain when a holistic 
review process would be implemented, but said 
both forms of evaluating applications are effective.

“Both holistic review and comprehensive 
review adhere to the guidelines approved by the 
Board of Admissions & Relations with Schools,” 
Brown said. “Our analysis shows significant agree-
ment in outcomes between both processes.”

becomes  d inne r  ][  so  tha t  l e t t e r

Armantrout first began working at UCSD 
in 1981 as a part-time lecturer. Nearly 30 years 
later — a staple professor for LTWR 8B: Writing 
Poetry — she insists her appreciation for the 
written word has only increased. 

“I always knew that I wanted to write poetry,” 
she said. Her mother would often read poetry 
aloud when she was a child, fostering a respect of 
the written word that bloomed as she got older. 
Down the line, Armantrout found herself most 
drawn to prehensile poets like Emily Dickinson, 
whose cerebral conceits and economical 
approach had a heavy influence on Armantrout’s 
own poetry.

In the preface to “Veil” — a 2001 selection 
of Armantrout’s poems — fellow poet and critic 
Ron Silliman described her poetry as “the lit-
erature of the anti-lyric, those poems that at 
first glance appear contained and perhaps even 
simple, but which upon the slightest examination 
rapidly provoke a sort of vertigo effect as element 
after element begins to spin wildly toward more 
radical ... possibilities.” 

After transferring from San Diego State to UC 
Berkeley in 1969, Armantrout found herself sur-
rounded by a gyre of Vietnam War protests and 
social activism. It was there that fellow students 
noticed her budding poetic prowess and encour-

INFOCUS MUIR MUSICAL WELCOMES THE LORAX TROLLEY

Last Friday, about 15 to 20 cast members from the student organization Muir Musical performed the opening number from their “Seussical the 
Musical” production, “Oh, the Thinks You Can Think” — 
but this time it wasn’t in the safety of their Mandeville 
Auditorium set. Instead, they ushered the unveiling of 
the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System’s new trolley.

The trolley — a collaboration between MTS and 
Dr. Seuss Enterprises — is painted with scenes from 
The Lorax, a children’s book written by Theodor Geisel 
— of UCSD’s famous spaceship library. 

The words “Go Green!” are also painted on the car, 
along with the warning: “Unless someone like you cares 
a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s 
not” — a line from Theodor Geisel’s well-known story.

The event kicked off a series of events in honor 
of Earth Day on April 22, including an appearance by 
the Lorax-themed trolley at UCSD’s Clean Car Show 
this upcoming Thursday. It will also be running on the 
Orange and Green lines over the next few months.

Audrey Geisel — Theodor’s widow and president 
of Dr. Seuss Enterprises — and a guy in a Lorax suit 
were also present for the trolley unveiling, which 
was geared toward promoting the conservation of 
resources and encouraging children to be more envi-
ronmentally conscious.

R ising from a campus full of mediocre shower singers and American Idol wannabes, the 
competitively selected singers in the 
UCSD Tritones are a breath of fresh 
talent. Don’t believe us? If world-
famous pop star Taylor Swift chose 
the a capella group to sing backup for 
her nationally televised Academy of 
Country Music Awards concert in Las 
Vegas, they’ve got to be doing some-
thing right. 

The Tritones spotted their chance 
when producers from the CBS network 
contacted a handful of collegiate a 
cappella groups in search of a backup 
choir for Swift.

After sending in their rendition of 
Swift’s “You Belong With Me” — which 
they performed in Ledden Hall — the 
Tritones received a call informing 
them that Swift had handpicked them 
to accompany her onstage.

Revelle College senior Teresa Souto 
— the Tritones’ assistant director, 
and one of the four sopranos of the 
group — said she was ecstatic to have 
beat out national competition for the 
chance to sing with Swift.

“Through opportunities like this, 
the more our name will get out there 
and people will not only know who 
we are but who UCSD is,” Souto said.  
“We hope to have more of a reach out

side of UCSD and San Diego.”
Founded in 1996 by a group of 

high-school choir friends searching 
for an artistic outlet, the Tritones 
were the first of UCSD’s a cappella 
groups.  Comprised of 16 members 
— four soprano, four alto, four tenor 
and four bass — the group rehearses 
twice a week to perfect their collective 
harmony.

These days, Tritones auditions are 
the most cutthroat on campus. Every 
Fall Quarter, prospective members 
are asked to memorize “The Star 
Spangled Banner” and perform an 
additional one-minute song excerpt 
that highlighted their particular vocal 
skills.

Candidates must also pass a series 
of tests determining their ability to 
sight-read, clap to complex rhythms 

and memorize tones. Last fall, over 
100 students auditioned for a only 10 

open spots.  
Souto 

said that — 
although 
each mem-
ber of the 
Tritones has 
a unique 
set of inter-
ests — it’s 
the thrill 
of group 
perfor-
mance that 
brings them 
together. 

“Some 
members of 

the group are on sports teams, some 
are in musical theater; our majors 

range from pre-med, political science 
to economics,” Souto said. “We are all 
really different, but we do have one 
thing in common — and that’s where 
we love to sing.” 

This March, for the first time 
ever in UCSD history, the Tritones 
won first place in the International 
Championship of A Cappella quar-
terfinals at UC Berkeley, advanc-
ing them to the semifinals at  the 
University of Southern California.

Their winning sets included Lady 
Gaga’s “Speechless,” Michael Buble’s 
“Haven’t Met You Yet” and Queen’s 
“Don’t Stop Me Now.” Although they 
did not advance to the finals, the 
Swift performance is sure to meet 
their quota for limelight   — at least 
for the time being.

EL SALVADOREÑO

SITESEEN

H oused in the Grant Hill neigh-borhood near downtown, El Salvadoreño serves authentic, 
filling and — most importantly — 
inexpensive Latin American grub. 

Well worth a 20-minute caravan 
from campus, El Salvadoreño exists in 
a world apart from the high prices and 
cramped bustle of the Gaslamp District; 
instead, the eatery’s nearest neighbors 
are empty lots of dirt adorned with 
chain-link fencing and dingy corner-
stores. But unless you’d rather stick to 
Los Primos’ antiseptic burritos, your 
expedition will be generously rewarded 
with some pretty tasty eats.

El Salvadoreño is homey and 
underembellished — your classic fam-
ily sit-down restaurant. Aside from 
a colorful ceiling mural, decorations 
are sparse. Tables and chairs are scat-
tered throughout the restaurant’s single 

room, and a 
large open 
kitchen pro-
vides for a view 
of your meal’s 

preparation.
Service is prompt — even at peak 

hours — and the menu is overflowing 
with Central-American dishes like the 
crisp baleadas (bean and cheese que-
sadillas) and hearty caldo de res (beef 
soup). The finest goods in the house, 
though, are El Salvadoreño’s homemade 
pupusas, which — at just $2 a pop — 
are a godsend for both your budget 
and your hangover. The corn disks are 
served piping hot, stuffed with melting 
cheese and any combination of chick-
en, pork, loroco, jalapeños or beans 
— then topped with spicy red-pepper 
salsa and cabbage salad.

If you’re not already expecting a 
baby after the main course, the des-
sert menu is a worthy adventure. Skip 
the soggy empanadas con crema (deep 
fried bananas and cream) and opt for 
a dish of smooth, caramel flan — sure 
to put to shame that store-bought ver-
sion that’s been sitting in your fridge 
all month.

aged her to pursue the written word more 
seriously. 

“It was very exciting. Having people 
take my poetry seriously — taking poetry 
seriously at all was exciting,” Armantrout 
said. 

In the late 1960s, Armantrout and 
some friends formed a community of 
poets who sought to investigate the struc-
ture of language — not unlike master 
modernist Louis Zukofsky, a poetic pre-
cursor — with a conversational tone. They 
were later dubbed the Language Poets, 
and included the likes of Ron Silliman, 
Bob Perelman, Steve Benson and Lyn 
Hejinian.

“It was intense, because all of those 
people were very smart and took them-
selves very seriously,” Armantrout said. 

After earning her master’s in creative 
writing at San Francisco University, 
Armantrout moved back to San Diego in 
1978. Initially, she felt alienated from her 
former home. But after spending the next 
couple years raising son Aaron, with her 
husband Chuck Korkegian, Armantrout 
finally landed a job at UCSD. Colleagues 
like Michael Davidson, she said, helped 
to ease the transition from Northern 
California — where Armantrout was sur-
rounded with like-minded modernists 
— to Southern California. 

Still, she faced some opposition from 
staunch academics when she began almost 
two decades ago.

“When I first taught poetry here, 
people tended to be resistant to modern 
poetry.” Armantrout said. “They tended 
to feel that poetry should rhyme and look 
like romantic poetry or Shakespearean 
sonnets. Now, they seem much less resis-
tant.”

Marshall College senior Thomas 
Trudgeon — who’s currently working with 
Armantrout on his honors thesis — said 
he admires Armantrout for her modern 
approach to language.

“She’s a total sweetheart and makes 

you engage with language in ways you had 
never thought of before,” Trudgeon said. 
“She’s always been the sturdy backbone to 
the program and one of the more alluring 
attractions. In fact, she’s one of the rea-
sons why I came to UCSD when I was in 
high school.”

After she was diagnosed with cancer in 
2006, Armantrout underwent surgery and 
chemotherapy. It was largely her ability 
to investigate her own mortality from an 
objective standpoint in “Dark Matter” that 
raked in such great acclaim. 

According to Armantrout, her poetry 
involves introspective reasoning — an 
activity that helps her unravel her 
thoughts more clearly. 

“Often, I start when I feel puzzled 
about something and I don’t know why,” 
she said.

Though “Versed” has received more 
media attention than any of her previous 
collections — and, according to the pro-
fessor, reacquainted her many old friends 
— Armantrout said she is unsure if her 
latest collection is indeed her best work, 
let alone her favorite. 

“I don’t know,” she said. “I think that 
it’s a good book — as good as the last 
book.  It’s amazing how winning some-
thing seems to make everyone think that 
you’re better than you were before.”

And as far as the future, this 2008 
Guggenheim Fellow in poetry has no 
plans to stop writing or teaching anytime 
soon. In fact, Armantrout said she plans 
to release another collection of poems 
next spring. It’s called “Money Shot,” and 
it explores the furrows of the recent finan-
cial crisis. 

“Poetry gets me high somehow,” 
Armantrout said. “I get a charge out of 
it — it keeps me engaged. It is its own 
reward. It’s great to get prizes, but I was 
enjoying it before that. I’m just doing what 
I love doing.”

really hurt my chances of making it to 
regionals.”

The Tritons managed an eighth-
place finish at the event, though the 
inclusion of Samra’s score would have 
moved UCSD into sixth-
place overall.

After transferring 
from community college, 
Morris had trouble transi-
tioning to the Division-II 
level during early season 
play. But after finish-
ing in a tie for 13th place 
at the Grand Canyon 
Thunderbird Invitational, 
Morris said he believes he 
is in a good frame of mind 
going into the champion-
ship this week.

“It has been a tough 
season, but this past 
month has been promis-
ing,” he said. “This week 
is pretty important — it is 
the conference championships.”

The Tritons’ performance at 
the Grand Canyon Thunderbird 
Invitational was a glimpse of how 
Wydra and his squad had hoped to 

play all season. Morris fired the best 
individual round all season for the 
Tritons with a four-under-par 68. 
UCSD also shot its lowest team round 
and overall score with an even-par 
288 and eight-over-par 872, respec-

tively.
While Okasaki, Samra 

and Morris look to cement 
their positions at the Super 
Regionals, sophomore 
Justin Gabbert and fresh-
man Anubhav Rastogi will 
look to gain valuable expe-
rience for next season at 
the tournament.

Gabbert, who under-
went significant swing 
changes in the middle of 
the season to help pro-
vide more consistency to 
his game, has epitomized 
UCSD’s inconsistent play 
throughout the season.

“I never knew what 
was going to happen [in 

my rounds],” Gabbert said. “Every tee 
shot was an adventure, and I was real 
streaky. I could be two-under-par for 
14 holes and end up shooting [six-
over-par]. A few bad holes ruined 

rounds.”
Rastogi earned his spot on the ros-

ter for the CCAA Championship with 
a stellar performance at the Hanny/
Stanislaus Invitational. At the event, 
Rastogi shot rounds of 74 and 75 on 
Day One. Though the Tritons did 
poorly as a team, Rastogi’s rounds 
gave him an opportunity to experi-
ence firsthand postseason golf.

“It’s an unknown going into this 
week,” he said. “ I don’t know what to 
expect as a freshman. I’m waiting to 
see how my game has improved and 
how far it has come.”

The Tritons have qualified at 
least one player for the NCAA Super 
Regionals every season during Wydra’s 
33-year tenure. Okasaki is shooting to 
become the first individual in UCSD 
history to make the NCAA National 
Championships. But that won’t come 
easily, according to Wydra.

“To make nationals, a player must 
be the top finisher in a 110-player 
field from a team that doesn’t qualify,” 
he said. “The quality of players has 
gone up this year.”

MEN’S TENNIS — UCSD entered 
a late-season showdown against Cal 
Poly Pomona on April 15 with one 
clear mission: to hold onto their No. 
3 regional ranking. And with a post-
season berth contingent on a top-
four finish in the Division-II Western 
region, the Tritons brought enough 
strength and resolve to claim a 7-2 
victory over the Broncos and sweep 
the season series.

“We just knew we had to take 
them out,” junior captain Vince 
Nguyen said. “Their team just got 
axed, so this was their last match, and 
they came out really emotional. They 
were fighting for their last moments 
and their last match ever, and we just 
came out to a slow start.”

 Although the Tritons had already 

beaten their opponent on March 2 
by the same score, the Broncos were 
especially charged for their last home 
match of the season — taking to 
the court after pre-game festivities 
to honor their graduating seniors — 
which posed early problems for the 
Tritons. 

Pomona sent an early statement 
of intent: The Broncos’ No. 2 doubles 
team easily toppled the Triton pairing 
of junior Armaun Emami and fresh-
man Austin West 8-2. 

“We started slow on doubles,” 
Nguyen said. “We weren’t firing all 
out, but we still pulled it together and 
came back strong.”

However, the Tritons recovered 
from their slow start, when their No. 
3 doubles team — sophomores Sam 
Ling and Jake Fellow — fought out an 
8-6 win against their Bronco counter-
parts. Then, the newly formed pairing 
of junior Erik Elliot and sophomore 
Chapman Chan blew away Pomona’s 
No. 1 doubles team 8-0. 

 Elliot carried over his on-court 
domination into singles play, sealing 
victory in a tricky three-set match 
against Pomona’s No. 1 Joshua Lauon. 

The Tritons registered wins in five of 
six total singles matches, more than 
sealing their victory.

 The win marked the last of 
regional play for UCSD. The Tritons 
have only one more match against UC 
Riverside before they begin regional 
playoffs: Irrespective of the result 
against Riverside, they will compete 
in regionals as a three-seed in the 
Western region against Brigham 
Young University-Hawaii — a team 
they struggled against on March 24.

“We have one more game at 
Riverside,” Nguyen said. “Then we 
go to Hawaii. We have to practice 
really hard because we got smoked 
last time we played Brigham Young 
University-Hawaii. We have to give 
them more of a fight and prepare 
for them. We’ll probably focus more 
on practicing harder through our 
Riverside match and be sure to come 
out strong for regionals.”

The Tritons will play at Riverside 
this Wednesday before traveling to 
Hawaii for regionals on May 8.

The Tritons improved to 34-5 
overall and 24-4 against teams in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

In Game One of the series, which 
took place on April 9 in Turlock, 
Calif., the Tritons rode an impres-
sive performance by junior starting 
pitcher Tim Shibuya, who threw a 
complete game shutout allowing 10 
hits with four strikeouts. The senior 
pitcher helped open the four-game 
series on a good note with a 7-0 win.

The Tritons and the Warriors con-
tinued the series with a doubleheader 
on April 10, highlighted by a nailbiting 
end in the first game. Trailing 3-2 in 
the top of the ninth and down to their 
final outs, UCSD was left with only 
a glimmer of hope, until senior first-
baseman Brandon Gregorich stepped 
up to the plate coolly and hit a home 
run to tie the game at 3-3. Junior third 
baseman Evan Kehoe followed the 
game-tying homer with  one of his 
own, giving UCSD a 4-3 lead. 

An unearned run put the Tritons 
up 5-3, and senior closer Daniel 
Simmons sealed the deal by striking 
out the side in the ninth. 

“[Gregorich’s] game-tying home 
run was awesome, and it really fired 
up our team and gave us the momen-
tum,” Kehoe said. “When I stepped 
up, I was just trying to hit the ball hard 
somewhere, get on base and put some 
more pressure on the defense and the 
pitcher. I just turned on a pitch and 
happened to hit it out. It was one of 
the most exciting games I’ve ever been 
a part of.”

Senior right-hander Matt Rossman 
started the opening game of the dou-
ble header, and provided a solid effort 
throughout six innings: He allowed 
only two earned runs.

The Warriors, demoralized after 
losing Game One of the doubleheader,  
handed the Tritons the momentum 
they needed to take the last two games 
of the series. Junior righty Guido 

Knudson led UCSD to a 10-2 win 
by allowing just two runs over seven 
innings, striking out eight and walk-
ing none in the process.

On the offensive side, junior des-
ignated hitter Blake Tagmeyer and 
senior catcher Kellen Lee both hit 
home runs, while Gregorich had a 
three-hit day and senior shortstop 
Vance Albitz tacked on a pair of hits 
and runs. 

On Sunday, the Tritons set their 
sights on a sweep, exploding offen-
sively for 20 hits and 18 runs in an 
18-5 win. Leading the onslaught was 
CCAA Player of the Week, Kehoe, 
who was four-for-five with three runs 
and three runs batted in, including 
two doubles. Junior catcher Michael 
Benton was right behind him going 
two-for-two with a pair of doubles, 

three runs and three RBIs.
But it was junior infielder Grant 

Bauer’s three-run shot that broke the 
camel’s back — he ended up going 
four-for-four with five RBIs and three 
runs. Six Tritons turned in multiple-
hit games, and five had multiple-RBIs.

A major key to the Tritons’ suc-
cessful offense this season has been 
the team’s constant ability to hit the 
ball into to the opposite field. The 
coaching staff has preached this phi-
losophy, and the players have worked 
to improve their swings in batting 
practice off the tee and in the cage — 
specifically for the outside pitch. 

“I think the most important fac-
tor to our success at the plate is the 
relentless attitude that we stress as an 
offense,” Lee said. “It is 100 percent a 
mentality of beating the pitcher. Every 

single one of our players buys into this 
philosophy of competing and never 
letting up. If you go into every at-bat 
with the confidence in yourself, more 
times than not, you will put together a 
quality at-bat.” 

UCSD returned to Triton Ballpark 
on April 15 with a four-game home 
series against Cal State Los Angeles. 
After dropping the first game 2-1, 
the Tritons won the next three with 
scores of 10-4, 13-6 and 5-4. UCSD 
improved to 37-6 overall with the win, 
and 27-5 in conference play.

The Tritons return to action at 
home on April 22, when they open 
a four-game series against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills.

Readers can contact Cameron Tillisch 
at ctillisc@ucsd.edu.

junior Valerie Tang finished with an 
8-5 victory. 

Though they swept the doubles 
matches, the Tritons only managed to 
win half of the singles matches.

Sophomore Samantha Yeung said 
she was confident, but also nervous, in 
the buildup.

“After the doubles set, I felt a lot 
better,” Yeung said. “[LaPlante] said 
that we shouldn’t feel pressure — that 
we should just go out there, try hard 
and have fun.”

 Yeung won her match 6-2 and 
6-4, and Anthavale won her match 6-1 
and 6-0. After junior Natalie Varney 
claimed the final singles match 6-4, 
6-1, the Tritons had clinched their 
seventh straight CCAA victory with a 
score of 6-3. 

The last time the two teams met, on 
Feb. 20, UCSD escaped with a narrow 
5-4 victory. 

“They are a really tough team,” 
LaPlante said. “I had a good feeling 
after Anita won. [Stanislaus] is really 
good. We had to play to win and not be 
afraid to lose. We just had fun with it.” 

Even though it’s the team’s seventh 
straight title, LaPlante said it’s just as 
thrilling as the last six. 

“It is just really exciting,” LaPlante 
said. “This is the second and third title 
for some of these girls, and everyone is 
developing really well. This win gave 
us a strong seed now as we continue on 
to regionals, with a good chance to go 
onto nationals.” 

The Tritons will continue their 
regular season when they face non-
conference opponent Azusa Pacific 
University on Wednesday, April 21.

No. 15 UCSD needed a championship-caliber performance against No. 19 Cal State Stanislaus if the Tritons were to make it to seven straight 
regular-season titles. The Tritons and Warriors, tied atop 
league standings with eight wins and one loss, faced off 
on April 17 at the Northpoint Tennis Courts with the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association championship 
on the line.

In a season in which the Tritons lost their 53-match 
conference winning streak at Cal Poly Pomona, they 

wouldn’t be denied their seventh straight title. 
After suffering an unfortunate 5-4 road loss to Point 

Loma Nazarene University on April 15, UCSD rebound-
ed to defeat Cal State Stanislaus 6-3, and claimed top 
conference honors.  

After three doubles matches at Point Loma last 
Thursday, the Tritons found themselves behind 2-1, and 
only managed to break even in singles with three wins 
and three losses. 

However, despite the loss to Point Loma, head coach 
Liz Laplante said the lady Tritons were confident going 
into the championship-deciding game against Cal State 
Stanislaus. 

“The loss to Point Loma wasn’t that significant,” 
LaPlante said. “We didn’t have all our girls playing on 
Thursday. We knew we could win if everyone was healthy, 
came together and played well. And that is exactly what 
we did.”

UCSD got off to a running start, winning all three 
doubles matches to take a commanding early lead. No. 
1 singles team Taskeen Bains and Natalie Varnay heated 
things up with an early 8-3 win. They were backed up  by 
the No. 2 team of Anita Anthavale and Jacquelyn Davis, 
who won 8-5, while No. 3 doubles team Cindy Dao and

BASEBALL — Eager to return to 
their winning ways after a 19-game 
win streak was snapped by Cal State 
San Bernardino on April 3, the No. 
3 Tritons went into a four-game 
series against Cal State Stanislaus set 
on restoring their elite status in the 
league.

The Tritons came through in 
a big way with a four game road 
sweep of the Warriors, notching 
important wins of 7-0, 5-3, 10-2 and 
18-5 over the seventh-place team in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

“We knew they would be a tough 
team to play, especially on a long 
road trip,” junior third baseman Evan 
Kehoe said. “They have good num-
bers as a team and play a similar style 
of baseball to us, but we just out-
played them all weekend. We played 
cleaner baseball than them, forced 
them to make mistakes and kept the 
pressure on them.”

Tritons Take Seven of Eight Games 
in Back-to-Back Series Victories

MEN’S GOLF — Over the past month, the Tritons 
have been busy preparing for California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championship, set to take place 
later this week. And after closing the month of March 
with a pair of eighth-place finishes, the team had 
reason to believe it could make a strong postseason 
run — until a sloppy finish at the Hanny/Stanislaus 
Invitational on April 12 and 13 shattered the team’s 
shot at the NCAA postseason.

UCSD has struggled all season to find consistent 
play in the fourth and fifth spots on its roster. With 
each team counting its four best scores from five, the 
Tritons were too erratic to compete at the same level 
every week.

“By the time things got better, we were too far 
behind to make [the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association postseason],” head coach Mike Wydra 
said. “We’ve had flashes of brilliance, but no consis-
tency this season. When people play well, we never 
get the fifth score. We usually have to eat that big fifth 
number.”

The 54-hole CCAA Championship will still 
be packed with pressure for three Triton golfers. 
According to Wydra, senior Keith Okasaki has all but 

officially qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals on 
May 3 to May 5 with consistent play throughout the 
season. Senior Raj Samra and junior Richard Morris 
are within striking distance of a spot as well, the coach 
said.

Samra said he believes he needs a top-20 finish 
this week, and that he is confident that his game is in 
proper form to a make a run at the Super Regionals. 
(The NCAA selection committee has yet to release 
any official statistics.) 

“I really want to make it,” Samra said. “I am really 
good at performing under pressure, and I have been 
getting my confidence back. Over the past month, I 
have really been changing how I think about golf. I 
wasn’t taking it as seriously, and realized it was affect-
ing my ability to make Super Regionals.” 

Samra’s chances for the postseason diminished  
when he was disqualified at the 60th Annual SoCal 
Intercollegiate from Mar. 22 to Mar. 23. According 
to league rules, players are required to have two 
signatures on their scorecard when turning it in. 
Samra failed to get his playing partner’s signature 
before submitting what would have been the Tritons’ 
second-best round on the day.

“I handed it to him to sign, and assumed that 
[my playing partner] did it, since the card was closed 
when I got it back,” Samra said. “Apparently, he was 
just checking his scores with his scorekeeper and 
never signed it. I shot 76 and bogeyed the last two 
holes. Not having that score count toward my average
