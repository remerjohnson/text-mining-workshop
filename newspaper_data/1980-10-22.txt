Another Commissioner 
(Grijalva) resigns AS 
Only 4 of Original 11 Still Remain in Post 

BY DEAN HAAS

Associated Students 

Commissioner of Academic 
Affa ir s Ernie Grijalv a 
resigned Monday, contribu-
ting to the high attrition rate 
that has plagued the AS this 
year. 

Grijalva 's departure 
makes it increa s ingly 
apparent that UCSD student 
government may be headed 
for restructuring. 

" I didn 't anticipate having 
as mll ch academic pressure 
a I'm encountering thi 
quarter," explained Grijalva, 
who i working toward 
completion of his t he is on 
Mexican agricultural reform. 

"I still plan to contr ibute 
minimal activity to th 
council," he aid. adding that 
he wi ll continue to work on 
campus recruitment and 
retention. 

Grijalva was also chair-
man of the AS rule 
committee and pre ident pro 
tem of the council. 

Applications for a new 
commi ioner of academic 
affairs will be olicited bv an 

appointments and evaluation 
committee beginning next 
week. 

AS President Bill Topkis 
finds Grijalva's resignation 
"distress ing," and expresses 
concern about the recent 
wave of resignations. 

" I understand that 
academics have to come first 
for Ernie," said Topkis . 
"When he couldn't give 100 
percent, he felt he should 
re ign. He will be seriously 
mis ed by this . council. He 
was one member who could 
come up with a relevent, sane 
comment when everything at 
counci l meeting was in 
di array." 

Out of eleven commis-
sioners and executive 
members elected to the AS 
council last spring, only four 
remain in their on~inal 
pos itions. ResignattOns 
earlier this quarter include 
those by AS president]eremy 
Charlton, Communications 
Commissioner Cindy Biondi, 
Public Relations Commis-
sioner Meg Honda and

BY JACK DANIELS 
Staff Writer 

A new Health Education 
program was established at 
the UCSD Student Health 
Center this fall, by recently-
hired Health Educator Susan 
Daniels. Daniels will also 
manage the Contraceptive 
Counseling & Education 
Clinic, replacing Sharon 
Keating as director of that 
program. 

"Basically, Health Educa-
tion consists of planned 
attempts to influence health-
related behavior," says 
Daniels, adding that this is 
done by providing students 
with "information that they 
can work with to improve 
their lifestyles" and physical 
well-being. 

Daniels has many ideas as 
to how this information can 
best be supplied to students 
who seek it. 

One option is the 
production and distribution 
of brochures and pamphlets 
which would present 
students with ways to 

rec~ize the symptoms of 
vanous diseases. This 
literature would also identify 
the meaning of such 
symptoms and indicate 
whether or not they warrant 
medical attention. Daniels 
also hopes to provide material 
that will help studen.ts who 
are unaware of the health 
services available to them on 
campus or who do not know 
how to best use these 
services. 

Another of Daniels' ideas 

concerns the development, 
coordination and supervision 
of "outreach" health 
programs staffed primarily 
by student volunteers 
trained by Daniels to act as 
~ 'peer health counselors." 
Such programs might be 
based in places such as the 
Student Center and the 
dormitories, locations more 
accessible to students than 
the health facilities situated 
riear Central Library. 

Still another possibility is 
the formation of "self-help" 
clinics, which would urge 
students to take a more active 
part in maintaining or 
lmproving their health. 

The type of information 
that these various "peer 
counseling" and "self-help" 
grou ps wou Id provide deals 
mostly with topics that 
speciflcally pertalO to the 
needs of the student 
population, says Daniels. 
Programs concerning weight 
control, acne and other skin 
conditions, human sexuality, 
birth control and venereal 
disease are just several 
possibilities she lists. 

"Maybe we can get a 
committee of interested 
students tOgether to talk 
about their health needs on 
campus," Daniels suggests, 
noting that the results of 
such a discussion would help 
determine what areas of 
health care need attention. 

Daniels is certain that 
Health Education will prove 
to be a very successfuly 
service at UCSD . Her 

experience with similar 
programs at UCLA and the 
Southern California Health 
Maintenance Organization 
- a prepaid health program 
involving hospitals such as 
Kaiser Permenente in San 
Diego - she finds that the 
over-all idea works well. 

Many of the people at the" 
Health Center share her 
optimism, Daniels believes. 
She has found the staff 
supportive of the program 
and "very receptive" to its 
formation . 

Daniels admits, however, 
please tum to page 10 

As it stands now, the 
committee will: 

-report within three 
months; 

-take all testimony in 
public; 

- consist of seven 
members (three students, 
two administrators and two 
campus policemen), though 
that structure could change 
because Collum and Topkis 
both believe a "neutral " 
chairman from the faculty 
should be found to replace 

Both plan to modify and 
finalize that model at a 10 am 
meeting tomorrO\\L-

All proposals for the task 
force have included the 
police, though Topkis 
acknowledges concern about 
their performance. 

"We thought about putting 
one police officer on the task 
force, but we were worried he 
would be unbendable . 
There's still a problem with 
peer pressure for two - they 
could just agree to help their

WHICH 
SHOE 
FITS 

BEST? 

Carter's not to blame 
Franz Schurmann, a professor of 

history and sociology at UC 
B.lleley, wrotes this for the Pacific 
News Service. 

Academics, more than most other 
constituencies, tend to vote for their 
ideals. As thinkers, they admire the 
power of intellect in leaders, and so 
many will vote for John Anderson. 
As policY'counselors, which many of 
them are or aspire to be, they want 
leaders to be forceful, and so this 
year some who normally vote 
Democrat will cast their ballot for 
Ronald Reagan. 

What academics, who by and 
large consider themselves elite, 
cannot abide is incompetence. 
Incompetence is what virtually all 
the disparagement of Carter boils 
down to. The image of Cartr, once a 
naval officer, is of a wavering 
captain letting the ship of state roll 
aimlessly on stormy waves. Why is 
it - many academics wonder - the 
United States can't ha ve someone at 
the helm like West Germany's 
decisive Hen- Schmidt or Britain's 

. determined Iron Maiden, Margaret 
Thatcher? 

"lhat Carter's accusers never 
mention is that the United States 
and the world have undergone ' 
profound and convulsive transfor-
mations during the preceding 
decade. The US is now sailing on 
political oceans as little known as 
the actual oceans were in 
Columbus' day. Herr Schmidt and 
Mrs. Thatcher can move forcefully 
ahead, but the fact is that for all 
their importance, Germany and 
Britain are essentially saihng on 
choppy but known inland seas. 

The US is the only nation in the 
world which bears responsibility for 
a big, complex and rapidly chan~ing 
society at the same time that it ftnds 
itself in the linchpin position of all 
kinds of international systems, also 

changing much more rapidly than 
people realize. . 

What this means is that the 
President of the United States is 
also a kind of President of the World . 
And Carter has realized after four 
years of hard-gained experience that 
the only way to manage his ship -
and the ships of other peoples - is to 
move sideways into the waves, 
zigzagging confusedly at times. 
What matters is that the ship 
survives and keeps moving. That is 
why I shall vote for Jimmy Carter. 

Never has the US been more 
enmeshed, economically and 
politically, with the world than 
now. Never has the US government 
borne more responsibilities for 
keeping the peace abroad and 
maintaining the national and also 
the world economy. Yet never before 
has the US government had less 
power to fulfill those responsibili-
ties . The reason is not the 
incompetence of the leader and his 
advisors, but the growing limits to 
the power of the nation·state. As 
noted Harvard sociologist Daniel 
Bell put it, the problem of the nation-
state today is that it is too big to deal 
with the small problems - meaning 
local - and too small to deal with 
the big problems - meaning global. 

To boot, never before has there 
been less consensus in the US as to 
what to do, and more wices, all 
pleading the cause of manifold 
special interests, telling the 
President to go-in a dozen different 
directions at once. 

In addition to incompetence - his 
own and that of his advisors -
Jimmy Carter is faulted for a pitiful 
record in the two key contexts that 
form the touchstone of the election, 
the economy and foreign policy. 

Fault for the woes of the economy 
are heaped on his shoulders. Yet his 
detractors do not mention that he

A Democrat for Reagan 
Paul Seabury, a professor of 

political science at UC Berkeley, wrote 
this for the PaciFIC News Service. 

This is the season when many of 
my intellectual fri~s are ~tting 
ready to vote theIr conscIences. 
That is their right. This time 
Anderson is their privileged 
sanctuary. He is the Norman 
Thomas of the eighties. A vote for 
Thomas, the long-time Socialist 
candidate, used to be a vote or 
decency in a sinful wor.Jd. Anderson 
offers the same chance; un-
electable, his impurities never will 
be tested. 

In my circle of Democratic friends 
and colleagues in ~~eley, ~ ha~e 
yet to find a single pohttcal SCientIst 
who plans to vote for Carter, the 
consensus here, amon~ those who 
otherwise greatly dIffer about 
weighty matters of state, is that 
Carter is the most incompetent 
president of our times_ "Extre-
mists" are heard to say he has 
damaged the nation. 

I am not going to go the Anderson 
route. I am a Democrat; it is hard to 
imagine myself a Republican .. But I 
intend to vote for Reagan WIth no 
qualms. Here are some reasons. 

It may be hard for some to 
swallow, but Rt;aP.n, when he was 
with us, was a faIrly good governor 
of California . He chose and 
surrounded himself with highly 
competent staff and advisors, and 
he made very good apPOintments. 
Some of these people are still with 
him. Now, in our Nemine times, his 
administration seems, by 
comparison with Brown's 
practtcally Augustinian. He did not 
put the state under .martiallaw; ~e 
did not ban Darwm from pubbc 
schools. Unlike Jerry Brown, w~ 
hold s higher education In 
undisguised contempt, Reagan 

needed no one to tell him what the 
mission of the university is. He 
enacted good legislation, some of 
which, had his name not been 
attached to it, could be seen as even 
liberal. (Oh, and then, he stocked 
jelly beans in little bowls in his 
anteroom in Sacramento for visitors 
to munch on while waiting. Jerry 
Brown ought to have a well-stocked 
cafeteria so that his appointments 
don't starve). 

Reagan's simplicity disturbs 
some of my thoughtful colleagues-
there is no complexity in him! But 
then, there was none in Harry 
Truman either. Like Truman, he is 
neither petty or vindictive. Truman 
delegated complexity . There is good 
reason to suppose that Reagan 
would do so likewise. He did it well 
in California. 

Reagan's maniacal Obenturm· 
bonnfuehrer image projected by 
Carter's Georgians may alarm all 
those who enjoyu being ~ alarmed , 
but I doubt that even Moscow sees 
~an that way. Whatever else our 
SoYlet adversaries do or want, they 
want a predictable American 
President, not one who kisses and 
then rants. Kremlin Americanolo· 
gists know .enough about the habits 
of American Presidents to know 
that it is better even for them to 
have an American President who is 
both respected and clear as to his 
country 's basic strategic objectives 
in the world. 

The intellectual chaos of White 
House foreign policy in the past four 
years (the product of McGovernism 
without McGovern, with a dash of 
Brezezinski) has been no boon tothe 
Soviets. The strange oscillations of 
mood and action in the WhiteHouse 
caused them to miscalculate - as in 
Afghanistan . The men in the

Boyce search 
moves to SoCal 

LOS ANGELES - The 
man heading the search for 
escaped spy Christopher 
Boyce said yesterday that 
sooner or later, just about 
anyone trying to avoid 
detection has to come out of 
hiding, and he thinks that 
Boyce wi ll surface in 
Southern California. 

"A person can stay 
underground for a long time, 
but after'a period of time they 
have to make some kind of 
contacts, unless they are 
hermits," said Thomas 
Kupferer, the US marshal' 
enforcement chief, "and that 
does not fit his profile. It 
indicates he needs to be 
around people." 

Kupferer is here as part of a 
new strike force that has the 
u e of aircraft and dogs to 
help track down Boyce, 27, 
who escaped in January from 
a federal prison in Lompoc, 
Calif.. where he wa erving 
a 40-year term for elling 
highly classified information 
to Soviet agent . 
, Although reports have 
\}Iaced Boyce as far away as 

South Africa, Mexico and 
Alaska, Kupferer said he 
actually may never have left 
Southern California . 

Investigators said they 
plan to tracE' routes from the 
prison to the home of Boyce's 
parents in Rancho Palo 
Verde for clues and they 
have hired a psychlamst 
who, over the past month, 
has studied the 7-inch-thick 
Boyce file and has concluded 
he' till in the area. 

"We have the same 
feelings," siad Kupferer, who 
added that Boyce may have 
had cosmetic surgery and 
grown a beard. 

"The easiest way to 
accomplish that remain in 
Southern California is to 
make a few chan~es in the 
facial appearance, ' he said. 
"Some of the writing that we 
obtained through the 
investigation from Boy ':e 
him elf indicated that if anJ 
when he was uccessful in 
escaping, that's one of the 
things he would do. We have 
several documents he had 
written to various people."

New wage 
laws here 

SACRAMENTO - A 
package of minimum wage, 
workplace and overtime 
standards affecting five 
million California worker 
will be enforced beginning 
next week, now that 
employers have lost a four· 
year fIght against them. 

The US Supreme Court 
paved the way Monday for 
the standards to take effect, 
retroactive to Jan . 1. The 
court lifted a temporary order 
blockir.,; the controversial 
wage rules issued by the 
State Industrial Welfare 
Commission. 

Beatrice Christensen, 
assi tant chief of the tate 
divi ion of Labor Standard 
Enforcement, said yesterday 
that the legal paperwork 
putting the tandards into 
effect would not be completed 
until next week . 

She said some worker 
who have not been paid the 
new minimum wage of $3.10 
an hour since Jan . I, uch a 
tho e who do housecleaning 
in hotel , wash car or work 
in theaters or bowling alleys., 

would be eligible for back

'fairly difficult" to estimate 

how many.

Welfare Commi ion former·

women and children. 

A 1972 law extended the

SAN FRANCISCO -
The state Supreme Court 
wa asked by thecitiesofSan

yesterday to throw out a 
Pacific Telephone rate 
increase of $30.1 milion. 

The two cities said the 
tribunal should r voke the 
rate hike - which applies 
mainly to business tele·

AS will debate advisor 
BY DEAN HAAS 

The AS Council will 
consider again tonight a 
proposal to "not acknow-
ledge" its administration -
appointed advisor, Randy 
Woodard. 

Woodard professes to be 
"not worried" about the 
resolution, sponsored by 
Warren representative 
Marsha Vdovin, and AS 
President Bill Topkis, who 
can veto it if he wants, is 
opposed. 

"If Marsha was around 
(the AS office) more, she 
would be in a better position 
to make this proposal," 
Topkis said yesterday. 

Eliminating Woodard 
would require a vote of the 
student body because it 
would amend the AS 
constitution. Vdovin has 
made no provision for such 
an election in her proposal . 

And Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affair Richard 
Armitage indicated his 
strong support for Woodard 
yesterday, citing his 
"sen itivity" to student 
issues, and Armitage 
indicated that Woodard 
would remain where he is if 
the AS recognized him or not. 

Woodard is responsible for 
overseeing AS disbursement 
of funds, and is administra-

tively responsible to 
Armitage, not the Council. 

Vdovin was not available 
for comment yesterday, but 

, AS Commissioner of 
Student Welfare Reggie 
Williams defended the intent 
of her proposal. 

"The idea of somebody 
functioning as an adminI-
strative watchdog (over the 
AS) is wrong," Williams said . 
"The bill brings up the 
fundamental question of self-
determination for students." 

Williams realizes tha t the 
bill must go before the 
student body a a whole and 
intends to amend it to that 
effect this evenin~ .

Born again Black 
rhythtn and blues 

BY BARRY ALFONSO 
AND TED BURKE 

pecial to the Daily Guardian 
It's a muggy Sunday afternoon and the 

members of the Landmark Community 
Church , a large converted home in central 
Los Angeles, sit in their pews, fanning 
themselves and await the arrival of their 
Reverend. 

Finally , .a large , dark-haired man in a 
black suit and tinted glasses strides up the 
center aisle and takes the pulpit. Adjusting 
the microphone , he smiles and tells his 
mostly black congregation , "We're gonna 
have some fun today." 

Exuberant shouts of testimonial and 
celebration, foot-stomping and singing from 
the church chorus fill the church. 

During a pause in the service, the 
Reverend asks a woman sitting in the rear if 
she'd like to share a song with the 
worshippers. She murmers a few soft words 
after she assumed the microphone and as 
the organist plays, she wails a gospel song in 
a powerful, wrenching voice. Thanking the 
congregation for their applause, the singer, 
Della Reese, returns to her seat. 

If Reese's solo brought a bit of Show 
Business to the service, it was nothing 
unusual for the seven-month-<>Id church. 
Along with Reese, such performers as 
singers Etta James and Esther Phillips, 
blues violinist Papa John Creach and actor 
Whitman Mayo regularly attend and 
occasionally perform during services. 
Entertainers are warmly welcomed into the 
Landmark flock because its pastor, the-
Reverand Johnny Otis, used to be one 
himself. 

"One day , after I'd come home off tour," 
Otis relates, "Sam Cooke and I attended a 
service at a mostly white church, and into 
the sennon the preacher noticed us and 

Johnny Otis 
leads church 
like his band 

made a remark that 'There's Johnny and 
Sam, in church after playing the Devil 's 
music.' Later Sam turned to me and said, 

'Johnny~ what we need is a church of our 
own.' What he meant was a church where 
musicians and entertainers were welcomed, 
not treated as outsiders." 

Otis made an international name for 
himself during the 1940s and 50s as one of 
the originators of rhythm and blues sound. 
As band leader, songwriter, disc-jockey and 
television show host, he helped make people 
all over the world aware of American black 
music, and has introduced Little Esther, Big 
Mama Thorton and Jackie Wilson to the 
public. His music has served him well over 
the thirty rears of his professional career, 
but now he Srutting his music and his life in 
the service 0 the Lord. 

The shift from being a musician to the 
clergyman came slowly. 

"I wish I could say it came to me in a 
blinding light," he says, laughing, "but the 
change was gradual. As a teenager, I became 
disillusioned with many American 
institutions, including the churches. There 
was a time I didn't even con_sider myself to 
be a Christian. Then one day I realized that J 
was blaming God for man s shortcomings. 
When J saw that in the late 50s, I was on my 
way back to Jesus ." 

It may seem odd that this Greek-
American's road to faith has led him to the 
pulpit of a traditional Afro-American

Thurber II -doesn't quite 
tneasure up to the first one 

By PAT LAKIN· THOMAS 
"Let us not forget the uses of laughter, or 

store them away in the attic" wrote James 
Thurber in The Duchess and the Bugs. Lest 
we forget, William Windom reminded us 
Sunday night in Mandeville Auditorium in 
"Thurber n," his one-man presentation of 
the American humorist's work. 

Windom's credits as an actor ' include a 
number of stage and screen appearances, 
but he is probably best known for his 
protrayal of Thurber in the Emmy-winning 
but short-lived television series "My World 
and Welcome To It_" Thurber's credits as a 
writer span four decades, from the 1920s to 
the 1950s, and range from his stage play The 
Male Animal to his reportorial work for the 
New Yorker, including such well-

Garden and the classic short story The 
Secret Life of Walter Mitty. 

Like the earlier "Thurber," which he 
brought to Mandeville exactly one year ago, 
Windom was careful in Sunday night's 
selection of pieces to give us not just the 
warm and slightly zany Thurber everyone 
knows, but the writer in all his moods: the 
reporter and social commentator describing 
the sensation-seeking crowd at the landing 
of a disabled Zeppelin in "Hot Dog," the 
romantic (in the serious autobiographical 
piece "The Evenings at Seven"), the 
curmudgeon and misogynist (describing his 
friend's "tapioca-brained wife), the 
sentimentalist, the philosopher, and even 
the neurotic (in a devilishly witty 
monologue about a timid man looking for a 
large box to hide in.) 

"Thurber II" was billed as a "multi-media 
j)resentation," which in this case means 
Windom brought along a slide carousel full 
of Thurber's drawings arranged in groups 
which he interspersed with the monologues. 
The slides included a number of Thurber's 
cartoons, such as the famous seal in the 
bedroom and the lady on the bookcase, for 
which Windom read the captions; several of 
his series ("The Bloodhound and the Bug," 
"The Patient"); and his "Famous Poems 
D1ustrated" in which Thurber lampooned 
well-known works like John Greenleaf 
Whittier's "Barbara Frietchie" by 
supplying them with absurdly comic 
drawings. 

It was a fine idea to ba J ~na' t he prose with 
a selection of cartoons, includmg a few 
unJlUblished drawings from the THurber 
Co1Iection at Ohio State .. The rippling 
laughter in the auditorium indicated that 
the ~ were new to man}' members of the 
audIence. However the "Famous Poems"

Emanuel Ax, one-third of a 'string quartet that will 
make its debut at UCSD. 

New chatnber 
trio debuts here 

Ax, Fisher, Ma unite 
UCSD will host the 

premiere performance of 
three world-famed soloists as 
a trio Oct_ 28 in Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

Featured are the first 
Rubinstein Prize Winner, 
pianist Emanual Ax; Avery 
Fisher winning cellist Yo-Yo 
Ma; and Youn~-Uck Kim, a 
Korean violin vIrtuoso. Their 
program will include works 
from Dvorak, Mozart and 
Beethoven. 

Though the soloists will 
play music together for 
reiaxation when not on the 
road, this is their first public 
perfonnance together. The 
eight-city tour includes two 
West Coast appearances, San 
Diego and Los Angeles. 

"We are friends - we 
enjoy performing together," 
explains Ax, who fields the 
answers for questions. 

The Polish-American Ax 
has captured more than his 
share of prizes in his career. 
In addition to "The 
Rubenstein," he has won the 
coveted Michaels Award and 
prizes in Warsaw's Chopin, 
Belgium's Queen Elizabeth, 
Lisbon's Vianna da Motta 
Competitions and the 
prestigious Avery Fisher 
Prize (1979). Ax performs 
regularly with the major 
symphonies including the 
Chicago (four times), 
Cleveland, Los Angeles, New 
York and Philadelphia 
ensembles. His all-Beethoven 
album was named as "one of 
the five best" by Time. 

Ma was bom in Paris and 
began studies at the age of 
four ,It was Pablo Casals who 
recommended him to 
Leonard Bernstein for a 
national television appear-
ance. He studied with the 
renowned cellist Leonard 
Rose at Juilliard before his 
career burgeoned with 
recitals and appearances 
throughout the world. A 
graduate of Harvard, Ma has 
appeared twice with "Isaac 
Stern and Friends" at 
Carnegie Hall and the 
Kennedy Center. 

Though Kim is not well 
known in this area, he is 
considered a gifted virtuoso 
and has performed in four 
continents . 

He won national attention 
when he made a New York 
debut and TV appearances 
with Leonard Bernstein . He 
has played with most of the 
major American orchestras 
and the international 
festivals of Spoleto, Salzburg 
and South Bank. Kim 
performs on a Joseph 
Guarneri del Gesu violin 
known as the "lipinski," 
dated 1737. 

The Ax, Ma, Kim Trio is 
the first concert of a new 
series of four sponsored by 
the La Jolla Chamber Music 
Society_ Others include 
Pinchas Zukerman conduct· 
ing and soloing with Saint 
Paul Chamber Orch, Amade 
Trio and the Israel Piano 
Trio. 

Naughty Sweeties

The Naughty Sweeties' Friday appearance at the 

AS Bash has been cancelled, but the bash will continue

'Bonjour' in SD 

The Sothern California 
Premiere production of 
Bonjour, la, Bonjour by 
Michel Tremblay will open 
tomorrow at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre. 

Tremblay, French Cana-
da's leading contemporary 
playwright, is the author of 
eighteen plays, two novels 
and numerous short stories 
and translations. He has 
received wide international 
acclaim and his plays have 
enjoyed productions from 
Montreal to New Zealand. 
This month Bonjour, la, 
Bonjour will have two 
premieres : its Southern 
California debut in San 
Diego, and an Off-Broadway 
venue at the Phoenix Theatre 
in New York . 

The play was written and 
firs t performed in 1974 as 
part of an eleven-play cycle 
centered around the 
Montreal neighborhood in 
which Tremblay grew up. 
Tremblay created a fictional 
treet . rue Fabre, which is 

populated by the working-
class Quebecois. The eleven 
plays share locale and many 
of the characters are 
repeated. The plays repre-
s ent a revolutionary 
exploration and articulation 
in everyday language of the 
characters and concerns of 
this culture. 

Tremblay's self-professed 
goal is to explode the family 
myths - the bonds and 
taboos that structure and 
restric the Row of love within 
the family . 

Bonjour, la, BO~ljour is a 
portrait of one such family . 
Serge, the youngest son, has 
returned from a three-month 
sojourn in Paris_ In his 
a bsence, each of the mem bers 
of his family, his four sisters, 
his aunts, and his father, 
have had to face their need. 
their lonliness, and their love 
for him. 

His homecoming right 
becomes a kaliedoscope of 
conversations that ebb and 
flow and play counterpoint to 
Serge's own sensitive search 
for a new definition of love. 

David Hay , a local director 
and instructor, is staging the 
play_ Hay has also directed 
"Witness for the Prosecu-
tion" at the Old Globe 
Theatre , for which he 
received the 1980 Atlas 
Award for Best Director. 
Currently , he is an acting 
instructor with the San 
Diego Repertory Theatre's 
Acting Conservatory. 

Bonjour, la, Bonjour will 
play Wednesday through 
Sunday evenings through 
N?v. 15, at 8:00 pm. There 
Will be two Sunday matinees 
on Nov. 2 and 9 at 2:30 pm. 

This is the first time the 
Rep . wilI play Wednesday 
evenmgs on a regular basis. 

Tickets are $6.00 for 
Friday and Satuday evenings 
and $5.00 for Wednesday, 
Thursday and Sunday

Thurber II 
continued from page 5 
had the look of 1il-
ler material: the draw-
ings are amusing, but 
their humor is largely 
wasted on those of us who 
are too young to have had 
these hoary old classics 
drummed into us in 
grammar schooL Mr main 
objection to the 'multi-
media" approach, how-
ever, is that Windom failed 
to provide equipment to 
fade from one slide to 
another, and as a result 
our eyes were assaulted 
with abrupt cuts to black 
after every slide. 

This technical oversight 
was a symptom of the 
performance's weak-
nesses: I had the definite 
impression that we were 
beilll subjected to the try-
out of a new show which IS 
still in need of extensive 

polishin~. Last year's 
presentatIon was smooth 
and professional, moving 
from one selection to 
another without the need 
for explanations , and 
Windom maintained a 
consistent Thurber 
characterization 

Sunday night, however, 
Windom startled us by 
dropping suddenly out of 
cbafacter, fint to set up a 
Talk of the Town piece by 
mentioning Thurber's 
work on the N_ YM'Ur, 
and several times later in 
the evenilll to attach 
unneceuary titles to his 
eroupinp of drawings and 
to intel'Ject unprofessional 
comments such as "I had 

room for three more slides, 
so I couldn't resist ... " At 
one point he even appealed 
to the audience for 
suggestions on how to 
arrange one of the running 
gags in his cartoon series_ 

This was most painfully 
obvious when he ended the 
evening abruptly with the 
fable about the clothes 
moth and the luna moth, a 
piece which is fine by itself 
but is not nearly strong 
enough to close a 
performance with. It may 
be that Windom had used 
all the real gems in the 
first performance; in 1979 
he included favorites s uch 
as "The Moth and the 
Star" and "One is a 
Wanderer" and ended 
with what I can only 
describe as a rousing 
rendition of "The Secret 
Life of Walter Mitty," 
which left us with the final 
daydream in which Mitty 
the Undefeated (and by 
analogy Thurber's "fan· 
tasy principle" as well) 
boldly faces the firing 
squad, "inscrutable to the 
last. " 

If Windom's structure 
for this year's version 
seemed clumsy, his 
delivery was always sure· 
footed. Every individual in 
a monologue was supplied 
with his own miDlature 
characterization, and the 
accents and gestures were 

inevitabl~ appropriate, as 
in "The Thm Red Leash" 
when Windom gave. us 
individual portraits of the 
local touJdts who insult the 
writer's little Scotty pUP.

, 

Johnny Otis and 
rhythnt and blues 
continued from page 5 
church, but Otis' link with 
the black community is a 
strong one. Born John 
Veliotis in Vallejo, California, 
he grew up in a racially mixed 
area and attended black 
churches as a boy. As a 
teenager his passion for jazz 
was sparked by a perfor-
mance of Count Basie's Big 
Band ("They set me on fire"), 
an experience that made him 
resolve to become a musician 
himself. 

Taking up drums, he soon 
became proficient enough to 
set jobs with Bay Area boogie- . 
woogie groups , most notably 
Count Otis Matthews and 
the Oakland House Rockers . 
By 1947 he was leading his 
own bi~ band, based at Los 
Angeles old Alabam Club, 
and toured nationally as well . 

By this time, Otis had 
witnessed for himself how 
black talents were denied the 
recognition they deserved. It 
galled him that white 
entertainers performing 
black-created music were 
reaping all the financial 

. rewards and winning all the 
fame. 

"There's been a whole 
pattern of whites ripping off 
black art in this country," 
claims Otis. "Jazz, blues and 
rock were all appropriated 

lo~ distance. Why was Paul 
WhIteman the 'King of Jazz' 
and not Louie Armstrong? 
Why was Elvis Presley the 

'King of Rock and Roll' and 
not Chuck Berry?" This 
indignation may have pushed 
him into community 
involvement, both as 
entertainer and concerned 
citizen. 

Guided by his thorough 
knowledge of the LA blues 
scene, Otis established his 
own c1u b, The Barrell House, 
in 1948. From the start the 
Barrell House received full 
s upport from the communit y 
and in its four years became 
the birthplace of modern 
rhythm and blues. 

I'Most of the musicians I 
knew had big band experi-
ence, but we couldn 't got 
work, so we played blues to 
please the audience," he 
recalls . "But we kept some of 
the horns and a rhythm 
section playing a blues beat. 
We came up with something 
different, a hybrid that's 
come to be called rhythm and 
blues. It was born right here 
in Los Angeles." 

Otis' contributions to the 
new genre were suDltantial. 
Besides leading a major band, 
The Johnny Otis Rhythm and 
Blues Caravan, he penned a 
series of hit songs for ' Mel 
Walker, Esther Phillips and 
others, even scoring a hit of 
his own, "Willie and the 
Hand Jive," in 1958. These 
early songs became, to a large 
extent, the basis for rock and 
roll.

... presents Intramural Sports Shorts 
For most of us the holiday 

sea on doesn't start until 
next week. Next Friday is 
Halloween, and then comes a 
string of traditional biggies 
like Thank giving, Chri t-
mas and New Year's. 

However, for one little guy 
on campus the holidays start 
sooner. This Saturday, in 
fact. Yep, that's righ t. 
October 25th i a big day for 
the Budman. It 's the day he 
looks forward to more than 
any other. The day the 
BUDWEISER SUPER · 
SPORTS road show comes to 
ca mpus . The blue-caped 
squirt can't quite conceal hi 
exci tement . He' s been 
gleefully rubbing his hands 
together all week. 

For Budman, the BUD 
SUPE RSHORTS is the 
ultimate in all -sport s 
co mpetition . Volleyball , 
Frisbee, Obstacle Course, 
BOO-yard relay, Basketball 
and Tug-A-War. All in one 
day. 

For those of you who 
haven't tried it, it's instant 
excitement. And at the end of 
the day .... total exhaustion. 

The competition is open to 
any six-person coed team (3 
men, 3 women) that attends 
UCSD. A number of them are 
currently in un serious 
training for the all-day event. 

Paragon, captained by the 
Earl of Madness (Robert 
Cohen), is back to defend its 
1979 Championship. They'll 
have to improve measurably 
to steal the crown this time. 

Word has i~, that a host of 
solid, all-around teams are 
earnestly preparing for the 
competition. Most of them at 
Walk's Place. 

For those of you who are 
worried that you have to be a 
super athlete to compete, fret 
not. Supersports is not open 
to current intercollegiate 
athletes. It 's low-key, just-
for-the-hell-of-it competition 
that is strictly intramuralish._ 

For those that are 
interested, sign ' ups are 
currently being taken in the 
Recreation Gym Office 
through Friday afternoon. 
There is no entry fee. Specific 
Supersport information can 
al 0 be obtained from Scott 
Berndes in the 1M office. 

The two top-scoring teams 
in Saturday 'S competition 
will represent UCSD at the

tative teams from San Diego

Bartok resigns spot on 
Health Center task force 

Kaiser study says 
the pill is safe 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Associate News Editor 
"There was no real 

purpose to my remaining on 
the task force," said Student 
Health Information Program 
(SlflP) member Peter Bartok. 
"My goal in joining the task 
force was to get support for 
SHIP, but I now realize our 
focus is different." 

Bartok announced his 
resignation from the Health 
Center Task Force prior to 
that group's meeting 
yesterday. 

The recently·formed task 
force is investigating the 
Health Center and plans to 
"formulate viable, effective 

recommendations" for 
change as needed, says AS 
representative Pam Gerber. 

"After a few meetings, I 
realized the task force just 
wasn't addressing my 
concerns," said Bartok, who 
concentrates his efforts on 
SHIP's preventative health 
programs. 

Bartok admitted he is 
"concerned," about a Health 
Center investigation as an 
individual, but "would 
spread himself too thin" if he 
remained on the task force . 

''I'm working closely with 
the Health Educator (Susan

planning," he said. "AI· 
though I plan to maintain 
constant contact with the 
task force , I don't have time 
to participate," 

The task force discussed 
the questionnaire it plans to 
release early winter quarter 
at yesterday's meeting. 

Gerber also revealed that 
"Students have been coming 
up to me and telling me about 
experiences they've had at 
the Health Center ever since 
we began this investigation. "

PHILADELPHIA (AP) 
.- A new study claims that 
risks to women from birth 
control pills are "negligible," 
and reports that diseases 
previously linked to them 
may actually be related to 
smoking, drinking, number 
of sexual partners and even 
sunbathing. 

The 10 'y ear study, 
conducted by the Kaiser· 
Permanente Medical Center, 
under an $8 million grant 
from the National Institutes 
of Health , was released 
yesterday. 

"The main conclusion 
from this study is that in a

adult, healthy, white, middle· 
class women, the risks of OC 
(oral contraceptive) use are 
negligible," Savitri Ram· 
charan, the project ' 
research director, said at a 
news conference. 

She added that the result 
also should be reassuring to 
women in other ethn ic 
groups, though adding that 
additional studies are needed. 

Planned Parenthood 
estimates that between 5 
million and 8 million women 
in the United States use oral 
contraceptives. 

The study reports on the 
major forms of disease and 
causes of death in a group of 
16,638 women, ages 18 to 54 , 
who were studied between 
1968 and 1977. Two years of 
analysis followed. The 
women were enrolled in 
Kaiser·Permanente's grou p 
practice health care program, 
which serves 3.7 million 
members in Californi a. 
Colorado, Hawaii , Oh io, 
Oregon and Washington. 

The doctor said not only 
were there no significant 
differences in overall death 
rates between current or past 
pill users and non· users in 
the population studied, but 
that there was no definite 
evidence of an increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease in 
OC users compared to non· 
users. 

"However, OC u er in th i 
population tend to have 
certain personal habi ts 
which," she said, "put them 
at greater ri k of developing 
possibly serious types of 
diseases ."

continued from page 1 
that her department will rely 
heavily on students willing to 
volunteer their time working 
as peer health counselors and 
assistants in the clinics and 
programs. Experience is not 
necessary for Involvement as 
volunteers will be trained by 
Daniels to fill the variou 
positions . 

Interested students should 
contact the Health Education 
Department at 452·2419. 

When asked what kind of 
impact she thought her 
department would have on 
the overall health of students 
at UCSD, Daniels replied 
that the program will be 
beneficial, but in no way is it 
intended to be a cure·all. 

"People are still going to 
get sick, but it will be nice to 
promote health through 
education." 

Police 
continued from page 1 
friends, but students could be 
the same way, too. They 
could just protect the 
demonstrators," the AS 
president said. 

Collum said she thought it 
was important to let the 
police "feel they have an 
active role in developing the 
policies they have to 
implement."

The Daily Guardian Wednesday. October 22. 1980 

Carter 
continued from page ~ 
has presided over one of the greatest 
structural transformations of the 
US economy since the Great 
Depression. The de-industrializa-
tion of communities. the soaring 
cost of energy and other essentials 
have struck the US in a way that 
could have produced what author 
Paul Erdman proclaimed some 
years back as "The Great Crash of 
1979." It did not come. but few 
credit Carter for good navi~tion. 

Moreover. every economlc move 
the US now makes has repercus-
sions on the world economy. 
Everywhere in the world. including 
the socialist oountries. there are 
fears that the world economy could 
break up again as it did in the 1930s. 
Then every country retreated 
behind its economic walls. armed 

and re-armed, and made the 
holocau s t of World War II 
inevitable. 

Here, too, Jimmy Carter has 
sidled, not commanded. On three 
occasions, in late 1978, 1979, and in 
March of this year, he has acted to 
prevent a collapse of the dollar on 
the international arena even in the 
knowledge that it would do great 
harm to his domestic programs and 
electoral chances. He has had the 
courage to wear the hat of world 
president even when it might cost 
him the hat of US president. 

Again and again, he has been 
accused of bobbing in foreign policy. 
But look at the record - the peace 
and prosperity for the booming 
nations of the Far East, the new 
favor and influence the US enjoys in 
Africa. global approval of our 
campaign for human rights in Latin 
America.

m iscaIculate. 
Americans can take no pleasure in 

the fact that also among our allies, 
world leaders have sized up Jimmy 
Carter and do not respect him. They 
want an American President whom 
they can respect. Would they 
respect Reagan more? I think they 
would. I suspect that one reason 
they would, is that he would 
surround himself with experienced 
leaders; that in foreign defense 
matters he would be deliberately bi-
partisan; that he would address 
himself to our flagging defenses; 
and that he would signal to world 
that, with Vietnam now history, 
America is now governed by those 
who have no guilt over past 
misdeeds, and who - acting for a 

healthy new nationalism - Know 
that strength abroad requires a 
strong economy at home. 

I mistakenly voted for Carter in 
the 1976 primaries, when he was a 
pig ina poke. I read his Why Not the 
Best? I thought that a Democrat 
untainted by recent bloodletting of 
the national party would restore it 
to sanity; It thought as President he 
would draw a clean slate in foreign 
policy. I was wrong in all these 
conjectures, and in others too. If I 
had been a Georgian, I would have 
known better, earlier. Reagan is no 
pig in a poke; to Californians he is a 
well-known quantity. This time, to 
put it most mildly - why not the 
better?
