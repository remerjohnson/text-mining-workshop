Marshall 
students act in 
remembrance 
By STACY EISENBERG 
Contributing Writer 

Students and staff made a "quilt of 
remembrance" for the victims of the 
epr. I I terrorist anacks as part of 

Welcome Week's Day of Service. 
Participants included members of 

the Active Community at Thurgood 
Marshall College community service 
club, students from other colleges and 
adnlJl1Istrative staff. 

The quilt patches are actually 
slJuares of construction paper decorat-
ed by II1diVldual students during the 
service club's first annual Day of 
Service. For two hour on the morning 
of epr. 18, snldents were invited to 
come into Ocean view Lounge and 
construct a square using colored paper, 
markers, crayons, glue or anything else 
they could procure. The squares werc 
later taken to a professional printer 
and laminated. The quilt was laid out 
and the individual pieces tied together 
with string at the ACT meeting on 
Sept. 25. 

More than 120 students con-
tributed to the making of the quilt. 

The quilt is now displayed in the 
Marshall Dean's office. Ir will be on 
display for approximately one more

Students rally for peace, not hate 
MSA hosts 
event, Jurassic 5 
rapper speaks 
By EVAN MCLAUGHLIN 
Contributing Writer 

A peace rally featuring speakers from van -
ous campus organizations as well as JurassIc 5 
rapper Akil was held at the Price Center on 
Thursday at noon. 

The Muslim Snldcnt Association org.l-
nized the "United For Peace, ot \Var" 
demonstration. Motivation behind the event 
stemmed from increased racial tensions 
directed toward Muslims and people of 
Middle Eastern and South Asian descent, 
which have nared recently in the aftermath of 
the Sept. I 1 terrori t attacks on New YOI k 
City and Washington, D. . 

"Our mo t important objective is to edu-
cate," said MSA President Ahmed Salem. 
"People have been associating Islam with lCr-
rori m, and that is not right." 

Since the attacks last montll, there has 
been an increase in hate crimes towa rd 
Muslims and other edenic groups, Salem said . 
The mosque Salem attends, The Islamic 
Center of San Diego, has been plagued by 
cherry bomb and paintball attacks. 1uslillls 
entering the place of worship are often verb.rI -
Iy abused. Salem hopes that Thursday" event 
spread feelings of unity and undcrstandmg 
among attendees.

A.S. closes gates at Fa II Fest 
Turnout exceeds RIMAe's capacity 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

FallFest was a resounding suc-
cess Friday as record attendance 
forced the A.S. Council to close 
entry gates to RIMAC Arena, bar-
ring many students from entering 
the event. 

Afroman acted as a last-minute 
substitute for Toya, joining Alien 
Ant Farm and Warren G in this 
year's concert lineup. 

"[The performers] kept the 
crowd bouncing," said Muir 
sophomore Jenny Damman. "Who 
says UCSD is an academic institu-
tion?" 

About 4,800 filled the arena, 
which has a capacity of 4,700. 
Students lined up from the 
entrance of the arena to Hopkins 
Drive, reaching almost the entire 
length of RIMAC Field. Some stu-
dents arrived two hours before the 
event started, ignoring the air

Original plans for the Day of 
Service Involved having children from 
The Preuss School work together 
with ACT to make greeti ng ca rds fo r 
scnior citizens. Howcver, after the 
a ttacks occurred, those plans were 
canceled. 

ACT leaders decided that the quilt 
was the best way for students to show 
their support. 

Paula Gluzman, one of ·the co-
chairs of ACT, said that the attacks 
were "still fresh on everyone's mind" 
on the morni ng of Sept. 18. Laying 
butcher paper on the floor of the 
Ocea nview Lou nrre, Gluzman and 
others handed out materials to the Stu-
dents and simply "let them at it." 

Gluzman sa id it was "nice to see a 
lot or energy and encouraging words," 
a, many students stayed to ta lk about 
their feelings after constructing their 
picce. 

"ning Marshall Provost Michael 
Schudson and Marshall Dean of 
Studcnt Affairs Ashanti Houston-
Hands each constructed a square. 

The quilt, which covers most of a 
wall in the Deans office hallway, is cov-
ered with various decorations, including 
American flags, praying hands, hearts, 
(lowers and lots of red, white and blue. 
Other squares sta te words of encourage-
ment or Bible verses.

"Action without knowledge is not

rance, and that is what blinds US of

AIUI promoted the positive aspects 
of Islam and pointed out the contribu-
tiuns Muslims have made ro society,

\V:lr of IHI 2.

,a id that man y others, inclu di ng

nati on because they have been 
misidentified as Muslim or of Middle 
Eastern descent. 

Hsu sa id that the A.S. Council had 
passed a resolu tion denouncing hate 
crimes and bigotry on campus. He also 
emphasized the Council 's wishes in his 
address. 

"We want to increase diversity and 
the understanding of diversity," Hsu 
said . "The only solution is unity, 
understanding and peace." 

Padojino, an SEJ officer and the 
las t of the student speakers, stressed 
the problems that will be created by a 
war, especially for minorities and those 
uf lower socioeconomic status. After 
commenclllg her speech, Padojino led 
the IOO-plus crowd in an "up with 
unity, down with hate" chant. 

UCSD held vigils Sept. 14 and 
Oct. 2. Former MSA President Nadia 
Aziz mentioned that Thursday'S rally 
was the first forum concerning the 
disaster that was "completely student 
run." The previous memorials were 
sponsored the Office of the 
Chance ll or and the A.S. Council , 
respectively. 

The rally ended with a 3D-minute

The Preuss School principal receives award 

The Preuss School principal, Doris Alvarez, will 
receive the Alice Paul Award from the National 
Women's Political Caucus during its 'Simp/y the 
Besr" awards dinner Oct. 11 at the Doubletree Hotel 
in Mission Valley. 

The award, named for Alice Paul. an activist in the 
suffrage movement and author of the Equal Rights 
Amendment, honors educators for "visionary dedica-
tion to education~ 

Alvarez became principal at The Preuss School in 
December 1998. She earlier served as principal of 
Hoover High School. 

She was the only faculty member at The Preuss 
School upon her hiring; she oversaw the hiring of 
faculty, the selection of students and the develop-
ment of the curriculum. 

The Preuss School is the only public charter 
school in Califomia to be established on a college 
campus. It houses 497 students in sixth through 
10th grades. 

UCSD bioengineers fabricate joint cartilage 
UCSD bioengineers have created artificial car-

tilage tissue that mimics the multilayered struc-
ture and cellular functions of natural articular car-
tilage. 

The tissue is created entirely from biological mat-
ter. 

Robert Sah, a professor of bioengineering at the 
UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering, led the study, 
which was conducted by graduate students TraVIS 
Klein and Kelvin Li, and staff researcher Barb 
Schumacher. Klein described the results at the 
annual Biomedical Engineering Society meeting Oct. 
6. 

The researchers believe that the engineered tis-
sue will mature as human cartilage does. The engi-
neered tissue is like the immature tissue in a fetus, 
which the researchers believe will help in trans-
plants because the cartilage will mature, integrate 
and conform to fit the patien( s surrounding joint tis-
sue and cartilage. 

The research is funded by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the 
National Science Foundation, the Rush Arthritis 
and Orthopedics Institute and the Grainger 
Foundation.

COL and UC Berkeley 
Electronic Press merge 

On Oct. 4, the Califomia Digital Library and the 
Berkeley Electronic Press announced their partner-
ship to Innovate in scholarly communication. 

The COL plans to make use of bepress' electron· 
ic publishing tools through the partnership to enable 
rapid and low-cost creation, management and 
onl ine publication of electronic jbumals, discussion 
papers and other forms of scholarship to aid UC 
researchers. 

The partnership is important to the develop-
ment of the eScholarship program, which supports 
new electronic publications and services for tobac-
co control research, environmental science, inter-
national and area studies, and dermatology 
research. 

The new partnership will support scholar~ed 
innovations in online dissemination of research. 

COL and bepress already had similar motivations 
for improving scholarly communication, including 
use of technology to quickly, efficiently and. cheaply 
distribute resources. 

Oral drug to treat primary 
pulmonary hypertension 

Pulmonary specialists at the UCSD School of 
Medidne have developed the oral drug bosentan, 
which is the first of its kind shown to reverse the 

dead~ consequences of primary pulmonary hyper-
tension. 

PPH is a progressive narrowing of smaI blood ves-
sels in the lungs. vJlich leads to failure of the ri;lt ven-
tricle of the heart If left untreated, it usually results in 
death, accordinS to Dr. Richard Olannick, UCSD ~ 
ciate dinical profesSOr of medicine_ PPH makes victims 
unable to complete minor activities. The survival rate 
for patients ~ before the development of 
bosentan is abOut three yeaIS. wilt! their treatment 
being constant intravenous mecication 

Bosentan blocks the natural~ ocOJrring protein 
endothelin, which ocOJrs in hiRher concentrations in 
people with PPH and hanns die pulmonary arteries_ 
The result is lower artery pressure. 

The drug is expected to greatly improve the qua~ 
ity of life for PPH patients. '

Claims of' defending freedom' in the 
wake of September's events often 
result in the sacrifice of American 
freedoms without question 

By CATHERINE NAVARRO 
Contributing Writer 

The U.S. response to the ttagedies 
of Sept. I) is turning from shock and 
anger into a fanaticism that leaves no . 
room for rational critique and analy-
sis. . 

Hate crimes across the nation are 
only a glimpse of the emotionality 
that threatens to plunge the country 
into blind vigilantism. Everyone 
knows of someone who has been 
threatened or harassed since the 
3ttllCJ.:.s - GUIIl'dian staffers, too, have 
suffered from the backlash - but few 
seem to realize that the spirit behind 
the harassment is perpetuated 
through other, more socially accept-
able means. 

Everywhere you go, you can see 
indications of the nation's haired for 
Osama bin Laden, the chief suspect in 
the a ttacks. While driving the other 

day, I saw a motorcyclist whose helmet 
read, "Execute Osama." 

. Such actions do not help us heal; 
they only perpetuate. the "eye for an 
eye" attitude that has taken hold. Very 
little separates someone who sports a 
helmet with such a logo and someone 
who gets a tattoo showcasing a mur-
dered, mutilated bin Laden - which, 
by the way, is offered at the Alien Arts 
Tattoo Shoppe in Savannah, Ga. 

There is also little difference 
between those pusive-aggressive 
actions and the Sept. 1 S murder of a 
Sikh man in Arizona who was targeted 
because he was wearing a turban. 

The recent plethora of American 
flags and pattiotic merchandise also 
indicates that misapplied fervor may 
cost us more than we have bargained 
for. I have no qualms with patriotism 
because I believe that now, more than 
ever, Americans need to come togeth-
er. Unfortunately, I suspect that the 

FATHERLAND' 

ways in which patriotic imagery has 
been employed only alienates people 
from one another; it unites one group 
at the expense of "outsiders." 

Witness the effOrts of those of 
Middle Eastern and Asian descent who 
have tried to partake in the ceremonies 
to II\OUI'n the dead, but who haft felt 
branded with hateful stares, as though 
they did not bel91l1 at such ~ 
monies, In I1Wl1 people's ' minds. 
unlortunate1y, there it • clear-cut dis-
tinc:tion between -us" ancl"~· tnd

that America claims to represen 
When we join topthcr in 1OHdaritr. 
we c:a1J on principla 'such as Creedoiii 
and indiVidualism to feel 1IIIified. 
Those people who perpetuate hate 
aimes in the wake of the September 

attacks invoke the same standards, but 
their actions obviously reek of any-
thing but these sentiments.

Patriotism: 
Fervor in the name of 
freedom fosters hatred 
Continued from pale 4 

sible for the attacks. A further 75 
percent of that group of warhawks 
agreed that the U nited States 
shoulJ instigate military action 
even if many thousands of inno-
cent civil ians must be killed. 

T hose who o bject to violent 
retaliation risk bemg branded as 
disloyal and unpatriotic . [n thi 
way, the patriotic bond shows itself 
to bc a double-edged sword. 

T hough patriotism has united 
millions across the country, it is 
clear that anybody who is per-
cci.ved to step out of line will suf-
fer the consequences. The United 
States lauds individualism and its 
upkeep at all costs, yet Americans 
ru n the risk of sacrificing that 
indiVidualism on the altar of sin-
gle-mi nded frenzy. 

If the nation is [0 step from 
this ordea l with its cherished va l-
ues intact, it must be wi lling [0 see 
that there are more sides to each 
s[Ory than it has so fa r been will-
ing [0 admit. It must be willing to 
recognize that constructive dia-
logue about these eve nts will 
mean amcking the things that 
breed comfort and lazi ness within 
u!>. 

mericans must not shy from 
analyzing the media and its ability 
to string US along on propaganda . 
Ther must not be complacent 
when the news describes the attacks 
as " the destruction of symbols of 
wealth and power." T hey lTlust dare 
to question what, if anything, could 
be so wrong with such a sta tement 
by itself. 

T hese things are a lot to ask, but 
without regaining its criti ca l eye, 
our nation risks falling victim to the 
tcmptations o ffered by indolent 
complacency. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Differences are a starting point for finding unity 
Job with international students shows diversity of world cultures 
By ALEX •• LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The other day, somebody from 
S,vitzerland asked me if I could 
cook. I had to laugh; I knew right 
away from the sarcasm in his voice. 
that it was just his sense of humor in 
action. 

We decided that his question fell 
under the category of "things you 
should not ask a girl upon meeting 
her." \Ne made up that little rule, 
and it quickly became something of 
an inside joke among the people 
who invented it. You could always 
bet that a good laugh would follow. 

Sometimes it's ea!>y to forget that 
our cozy little university hosts so 
many international students. My 
friend, the Swiss joker, isn't alone. 
Only recently did J realize JUSt how 
colorful our campus is, with people 
studying here from places such as 
Milan, Sao Paulo, ToJ..)'o and Paris. 

At times I feared J would scare 
them with all my questions and 
enthusiasm. I used to have a hard 
time holding it in. I have since 
learned to chill out. I didn 't want to 
come across as another pushy, over-
ly inquisitive American. Despite my 
efforts at restraint, I have happily 
worn my sinceri ty on my sleeve. By 
and large, the international snldents 
have been equally friendly. 

I probably shouldn't worry 0 
much. ['m just doing my job: I have 
conversations twice a week ,vith 
people from around the world who 
choose to snldy American culrure 
and English at UCSD . Not a bad 
gig, 1 think 

) used to joke with my friends 
that this job would be the closest I 
would get to studying abroad, at 
least for now. Although 1 have never 
traveled anywhere except Korea, 

and I know that traveling to anoth-
er country would be an arguably 
better experience, J can still appre-
ciate my current arrangement for its 
own often hilarious perks. 

When is the next time I'll be 
able to shop at Victoria's Secret witll 
Yoshi. a J apanese student, on my 
right, pretending to fit into a 
skimpy thong, and Nelson, a stu-
dent from Brazil , on my leli:, asking 
tlle suspicious clerk what kind of 
lotion he should buy his fake girl -
friend . All this is part of their sin-
cere effort to practice English in a 
"real American set-

Exceptions exist, however. 
Despite the apparent homo-

geneity of everyone's dress, for 
example, each COWltry has a style of 
its own, even ifit's JUSt a variation on 
that one ubiquitous outfit, 1 .... shirt 
and jeans. Clearly, what is comfort -
able is often more expedient than 
what will simply impress, although 
some are successful in combini ng 
the two. 

Brazilians seem to have their 
own nair with fashion - especialJy

T hese litde

to make me smile, 
all for a job that 
remains pretty sim-
ple. 

1 don't want to 
bore anyone with 
banality, but after 
four months on the

I also like the

One time, Gi ul ia

some cliches really do hold true 
abou t foreigners. You may already 
know some of them, but I'll men-
tion a couple anyway. 

First, most people arowld the 
world - or at least in Europe, 
SOUdl America and Asia - are just 
like Americans, superficiall y speak-
Ing. Perhaps it's that thing about 
globalization and everyone looking 
toward America to absorb pop cul-
rure, be It through music, clothes or 
even thought. Most of the interna-
tional srudents I've met really do 
look a lot like us. 

Of course, it works both ways. 
America borrows - or steals -
from other cultures all the time to 
spice things up. Whatever you want 
to ca ll it, the exchange is tllere.

impressive bracelet she made from 
about 1,000 safety pins. You have to 
love the Italians. 

Something else J would always 
hear about was how much 
Europeans love to party. After expe-
riencing firsthand the craziness of 
an "international party" - endle!>s 
smoking and alcohol included - I 
can vouch for that sta tement, bllt 
with one exception: Parties at tlle 
UCSD's International 1 louse would 
be a vi rtll a I , global open hou e. 
Everyone was invi ted, and everyone 
came: Japanese, French, Swiss, 
Argentines, Brazi lians, Chinese, 
Chileans, Ita lians, Koreans and 
everyone in between. 

1 had the unique chance to wit-
ness something truly special from 

my party experiences: people from 
all over the globe partying togeth-
er. Amid all the fun , and short of 
grabbing everyone's hand to sing 
"We Arc the World ," 1 would 
often ca tch myse lf thinking, "Thi!> 
is beautiful." 

In these confusing times. when 
most people wonder about wholll to 
trust and whom to hate, dc,pnc 
declarations of ulll ty th.n rcmalll 
tenuous at best, 1 think of what I 
have learned from meeting so many 
interesting and diverse people. T he 
world seems to have gotten a little 
smaller and more personal. After 
putting f,lces on places I have only 
heard abou t or seen in mOVies, 1 
have rea li zed JUSt how uplifting it 
can all be. ,"1 y tlloughts on the

Afroman, also known as Joseph

U. of Utah scientists identify key component of HIV 
Researchers say discovery has potential to yield a drug treatment for AIDS virus 

Iy to affect other viruscs," 
. undquist said. SALT LAKE CITY - The 

virus that ca uses AIDS comman-
det:r a white blood cell's own inner 
machll1cry, producing more virus 
particles to invade new cells and 
spreading the disease. 

But researchers a't the 
Uni\'ersity of Utah and Myriad 
Genetics in Research Park, Utah, 
have found a key component to a 
vi!':ll particle's escape from its host 
cell. 

Their results appear in the Ocr. 
S issue of the journal Cfll. 

T his IS till "basic research," 
said Wcs Sundquist, an author of 
the study an.d a professor of bio-

chemisrry. However, the discovery 
has the potential to yield a drug 
trea tment for AIDS. 

Based on the research, Myriad 
Genetics is working to develop 
such a drug, he said. 

Because strains of HTV resistant 
to currel1l treannents have sprung 
up recently, drugs using different 
mechanisms to thwart the virus 
must be developed. 

Doctors need the "next genera-
tion" drugs to fight increasing 
resistance in both bacterial and 
viral infections. 

"It's a constant war," Sundquist 
said. 

Researchers prepare

Biochemical weapons pose threat 

AN ARBOR, Mich. - As 
nightmares of biological and 
chemical terrori st attacks scare 
many Americalls, University of 
Michigan researchers are pushing 
to develop defenses against bio-
chemical weapons. 

Although researchers sa id they 
feel the pOSSibility of biological 
Jnd chemical warfare has been 
e.xaggerated ince the evenrs of 
Sept. 11, otTIe feci America should 
be aware of the pOSSibilities. 

" I think there IS a sig11lficant 
risk," said James Baker, head of 
UM 's all ergy and immunology 
department. "Certainly, there are 
countries that have these agents, 
but I don't think the risk is any dif-
ferent than before Sept. II . People 
should prepare appropriate ly for 
these is ues, but 

Using rats, Ward and a fe llow 
researcher have found that injec-
tions of a compound ca ll ed NAC, 
used to treat chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, greatly reduce 
the effects of mustard gas. 

"We think that perfecting the 
exact way this compound could be 
best de livered is very important so 
that one has more than just the 
concept of using gas masks to pro-
teCI agai nst such compounds," said 
Ward, who is seelong funding to 
continue the project. 

"We haven 't heard yet from the 
federal government," he added .

" It is true that if terrorist organiza-
tions were able to produce viruses 
in large quantities, it could be an 
absolutely devastating event, but it 
is unlikely that a group would be 
able to obtain and culture the

Ward, who studies mustard gas 
and its damage to the lungs, hopes 
his \y.ork will lead to an antidote to 
the deadly chemical. 

"It's a very cheap compound to 
manufacntre, so if a terrorist group

not difficult to make," Ward sa id.

anthrax. 

"We've been contacted by the 
federal government and are hope-
ful [it] will increase funding," 
Baker said . 

He and his team have worked

HlV, the virus responsible for 
NOS , enters a host cell. Acting like 
a parasite, it causes the cell to pro-
duce thousands of copies of the 
virus' genetic code. ew vi ral par-
ticles collect at the cell 's membrane, 
ready to be released, Sundquist 
said. • 

The authors found that when a 
certain cellular protein was elimi-
nated, the viral particles could not 
bud off and leave the cell. 

Instead , they remained stuck at 
the cell 's surface, unable to spread 
the infection. They determined 
that the protein binds to the viral 
particle and initiates the budding 

process. 
The protein is a crucial part of 

a pathway that probably involvcs 
many proteins, Sundquist said. 

In a healthy cell , this pathway is 
involved in transporting materials 
for degradation, all within the cell. 

T hough scientists already 
knew of the protein 'S existence, 
the study uncovered the crucia l

Week can be overwhelming with so many 
organizations there trying ro attract your 
attention. Among the political and social clubs 
are some that many snldents find just :IS 
Important as debating or partying: organiz.1-
t10l1, that c.lter to UCSD's spiritual needs. 

There arc 42 religious organizations on 
campus, Jccordmg to a Student Organiz.1tions 
and Lcaderslup Opportunities pamphlet. The 
b'fOlIp5 cover many world religions, and vary:lS 
much in their size and level of on-campus vis-
ibility :IS they do in their practices and values. 
Each contributes ro campus life in its own way. 

At first, UCS D can be intimidating, so 
many students affi liate themselves with a reli -
gious group to find a comfortable attnosphere 
that allows them to socialize, but also to 
remember what they are living for. 

Roosevelt sophomore Rebecca Cohen 
joined the Union of Jewish Students because 
it gave her the feeling of being with a family 
while away from her own. 

"For me, Judaism is linked to my mmily, 
and without that part in my life, T would feel 
disconnected," Cohen said. 

Muir freshman Amber Martin feels that 
joining a religious group on campus is "con-
sistent, making it easier to adjust ro campus 
life." She said that she thought of joining 
Campus Crusade for Christ because it would 
help her maintarn a religious connection away 
from home. 

CCC's purpose is to help students meet 
people and find satisfaction through their 
faith . According to its mission statement, the 
CCC is dedicated to giving "every student the 
oppornmity to know how they can have a per-
onal relationship with God." 

The club's president, Roosevelt senior 
Craig Shigyo, said the CCC's priorities are "to 
offer the Gospel of J esus Christ to the ca~1-
pus, and also to build a communi ty of love, 
grace and truth." 

The organization, which has about 200 
members, does this through meetings at 
which a different guest speaks each week. 

"That time is meant for Christians to 
come together and for others to come learn," 
Shigyo said. He said that each college has its 
own Bible study group to provide a more inti-
mate environment and discussion. 

The CCC also fosters student connections 
by providing festive environments for itS 
members. Each Bible group gocs out togeth-
er after sessions so people can get ro know one 
another. Shigyo added that CCC is planning a 
camping trip and a conference in Los Angeles 
with other Campus Crusaders. 

Marshall senior Richard Chen described 
the group as a "tight-knit commWlity." He 
explained that many of the other Christian 
organizations on campus, such as the 
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, work with 
CCC on events. This cooperation, Shigyo 
said, offers different viewpointS and chances 
to meet people. 

CCC emphasizes communication among 
different religions. It plans to hold a compar-
ative religion forum this quarter. Marshall 
junior Victor Ha, who is the CCC's outreach 
chair, is organizing a "nonthreatening, nonde-
bated forum, to allow people to deduce for 
themselves, and ge t their questions 
answered." 

Ha, along with the Crusade committee, 
believes that many come to UCSD unsure of 
themselves and their religious beliefs. He 
thinks that this forum will be educational for 
many. Ha said his goal is to unite speakers 
from the Muslim Student Association, U]S, 
and other organizations to individually 
explain their beliefs. 

The MSA is an active organization of 
about 50 members. Despite being smaller 
than other clubs, the MSA is "very active" on 
campus, according to Margaret McKnight, a 
manager at the Office of Religious Affairs. 

According to MSA president Muir senior 
Ahmad Salem, the MSA is "an area for 
Muslims to come together." It offers Koranic 

Brid,in".ps: Muslema Purmei of the Muslim Student Association speaks at Thursday's rally about 
the importance of discouraging ethnic and religious stereotypes. 

Rebecca Drexler/Guardian 

Giving praise: Campus Crusade for Christ members sing hymns at one of their weekly services 

Studies on Tuesdays and holds meetings 
Thursdays. 

"One of MSAS main goals, other than reach-
ing out to Muslims on campus, is to reach out 
and educate other UCSD students," Salem said. 

The MSA accomplishes this through various 
high-profile campus events. It sponsors Islamic 
Awareness Week, in which nightly lectures are-
designed to explain Islamic doctrine to non-
Muslims. Last year MSA held its first annual 
Culture Fest, where it displayed on Library 
Walk the worldwide reach of Islam. MSA plans 
to hold another Culture Fest this year. 

Like CCC, d1e MSA reaches beyond its mem-
bershi p to connect wi th sruden ts. Last week, MSA 
and 10 other student organizations together held 
a rally, "United in Peace," which encouraged heal-
ing after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 

MSA member Muir sophomore Tman Salem 
said the ratly was to show solidarity. 

"Muslims were shocked by the bombings, 
and we are hurting, too," Salem said in refer-

ence to the persistent fear and uspicion of 
Muslims among some Americans. "We wanted 
to express our concern and pain to snldcnts." 

Marshall junior adia Aziz Joined MS 
three years ago unsure of what to expect. 

"It is a whole different community," Aziz 
said. "As Muslims, we arc big on brotherhood 
and sisterhood, and the MSA is like my fami ly. 
I can COWlt on them for anything." 

She said that the organiz.1tion is ,ti ll grow-
ing and that it hopes to reach Ollt to more SUl-
dentS \vi tl1 each new event. 

Most organizations are experiencing an 
influx of members this year, especially U]S . 

Marshall senior David Weisberg, preSident 
of U]S, said a record number of people attend-
ed U)S 's Welcome Week barbecue, "Shmooze 
with the Jews." 

The rising number of participants may be 
due to growing awareness abom what U]S

It's really comfortable here. I don't feel 
homesick at all. 

Everything'S uphill from my dorm. 

Walking. I haven't tried any other. 

I think it's cool. I'm a very spirited person 
myself. 

I hang out with friends, 

I have no idea, I don't know much about 
frats. 

Never tried alcohol, never going to. I've 
been doing the academic thing for 14 years, 

35 hours? Five a day, maybe, 

My friend's roommate was a religious fanatic , 
She used to pass out pamphlets ... and wake my 
friend up for church. My friend pretended she 
was satanic for the rest of the year, 

This is a pretty normal plac~ ... at least where 
I go. I'm a boring person,

Could be bener, could be worse. 

I'm not big on the "party scene," per se, but 
pool, movies and just chill in '. 
I think it would bring the nightlife closer to

I think if you can keep it balanced, it's fine. 
It 's only when you get lost in drinking that a

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 

Quest for 'hotness' misguided, insincere 
Fulfillment comes after accepting average looks despite others' views 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Opinion Editor - ----- ---

11 h.lppened nearly a year ago, hut I don't 
forget IhHlg~ qUickly. 

to thank about thar the next time you si t down 
for a laugh at ule cxpense of your female c1ass-
matcs. 

Aftcr scveral years of contemplation, r have 
noticed a couple of th.ings about "hotness": 
first, it's a in not to have it, but second, it's an 
even greater Sill not to want it. 

I am content with my lot, so don't uunk this 
is a rant about how biner I am that I look noth-
ing like Catherine Zeta Jones. Like the mind-
less masses, I worship at UK delicious altar of 

People rcacted positively to how I looked. 
They foun d it novel and impressive that I 
would have consented to appear more as a 
1990s girl than a late-nineteenth century 
portrait. When I would rever! back to what I 
considered my normal appearance, they 
would ask when [ was next going 10 appear in 
my "hot" guise, as some called it. [ used to 
laugh ulis off with embarrassmeIll, but as the 
summer after freshman year wore on, I began 
10 feci the first tinges of offense creep into 

me.

Dressing up in 
that manner was 
more like putting 

on a mask or a 
persona, and I felt 

untrue to myself. 

I noticed that I was becom-
ing less comfortable with the 
style that I hat! adopted; that I 
felt it did not encapsula te the 
side of me with which I was at 
ease. Drcssing up in that man-
ner was more like putting on a 
mask or a persona, and I fclt

";\'lIle out of 10 UC girls arc hot, and the 
!emh g()c'> to UCSD." Doubtless IllJny of 
),011, e,peci~llly the older ones, have heard this 
,.:If-s.tt1,l\ed sneer at some point or another. I 
could ca.,liy l'Ounter it with the presentation of 
In} of Illy femalc JcquJlIltances, but I could 
nO! exhlllllmysclf JS a counter-exalilple.

one who willingly steps outside Ulat fold. 

People seem to take a particular delight in 
tr)~ng to play drcss-up With thosc who won't 
subscribe to conventional standards of beauty. 
I c:tn't tell you how many slumber party friends 
have asked to do a makeovcr on mc, and how 
many umcs I have squcamishly rclilsed. 

Finally, ulough, sOlllething gave way during 
my first ycar here, and [ consented to become 
a mannequin to my roommates for an evening. 
I found it wlcomfortable but bearable, goaded 
on as I was by their compliments, and I decid-
ed to make small changes in my appearance for 
a while. I occasionally ditched glasses for con-
tacts, dared to wear my hair down - I enjoy a 
famous reputation from \ Valnut Creek 10 San

instinct; I reverted more and more to my ndr-
mal appearance, with which I was perfectly 
comfortable and content, though I did keep 
the wardrobe changes. 

And ulen it started. I had ceased to change 
my appearance any longer and stayed the same 
old comfortable me, the one I like the best. But 
some of my friend began to ask more insis-
tenuy when I would next be playing dress-up, 
and would even urge me to come out to certain 
social functions only if ['d be "properly 
attired." 

This had always made me uneasy, but after 
two years of this badgering, it had begun 10 
make me downright angry. I would disnuss 
their bcle3b'llering questions absent-mindedly, 
or laugh sardonically at the mention of my 
alter ego. obody was any ule wiser. 

I realized that people had taken to the other 
appearance I created for myself; there was 
nothing wrong with that, in my book. What 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2001 

was infuriating was that I considered it a fake 
incarnation of myself, and many people 
seemed to prefer the fake persona to my real 
one, the one with which I was happy. Thls 
vexed me considerably. 

It doesn't bother me 10 walk by the l3ebe 
srore and see an enormous poster of a model 
whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie. It 
is bothersome, however, to imagine the indig-
nation of those who stand behind me, con-
demning me just because I don't want 10 try in 
vain to make myself look like that same model. 

Before my sophomore ycar, I SlOpped 
scrambling for the unanainable and realized 
Ulat I was most content with what I had been 
given. Some of those around me arc not, how-
ever, and I'll sti ll get the occasional requcst to 
be my "other self." 

I got over my perpetual irritation with OU1-
crs' poinuess pleading when I reali7cd that I 
was comfortable with my appeanlllce, no llIat-
ter what others might have thought of It. 
Indeed, I carne to realize that their nagging 
actua lly reflected more on their discomfort 
with my own desire not to conform than on 
any objective notion that I could actually be 
good-looking. 

HOO1ess is delicious - on ule people for 
whom it was intended. But most can't get it 
through their heads Ulat not everybody can be 
hot or want to be. TillS contes as a shock to 
many people, since horness is certainly one of 
the more lauded and ulirsted-afrer values of 
our society. I'm not a mover and shaker, 
though; I stay within the comfortable bound-
aries of my locative realm. 

Not to want to be hot, and to be truly 
satisfied with that state , seems to be roo 
much for some. Even if you come to accept 
yourself, it's funny to rea li ze tha t there are 
still going to be a lot of people who won 't 
accept you, particularly if you go against the 
grain .

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Because: 
Sports give opportunities 
for glOriOUS memories 
Continued from page 20 
tact was so sweet that 1 hardly felt it. 
The perfect hi p turn and extension 
or the arm~ were a hitter\ dream. I 
knew It was gone rroll1 the moment 
It left my bat. What I didn't know 
was where it would end up. 

Before I go on, I need to describe 
the lield that I wa> playing on . I liwd 
in a sll1all town. ur ciemenrary 
schools didn't have acrual baseball 
field" They had weed patche. wirh 
b:l,'-', and ru,ted bacblOp" Deep in 
the outfield, far beyond where the 
normal outfield fence would have 
been, was a row of portable class-
rooms. It was a hot summer day, so 
the,e c\ ,lssrooills had their doors 
propped open. Back to the tory. 

Once 1 hit the ball, I immediarely 
broke into a home run trot. I round-
ed the ba>c, a, slowly as I pus" bl)' 
could, rcveling in the glory of my 
heroics. \ Vhat I had failed to nonce 
was that I smoked the ball straight 
into one of those portable cla~s­
rooms. This was a special cducation 
classroom that 1 had interrupted. 

The >peclal ed teacher didn't 
like the fact thH a softhall st ruck 

him in the leg a he was trying to 
help a boirl in a wheelchair go to the 
bathroom. I got that impression 
when he ran out of the classroom 
screaming and la unched Illy hOllle 
run ball back onto the field . 

Since our field had no home nm 
fence, the ball was technically still 
live. I had only busted my home run 
trot because I thought that the 
chubsters In center field could never 
get to that ball before 1 crossed 
home. I hadn't counted on a linlc 
help from the special ed reacher. 

I was between second and third 
when I saw the ball being rclayed in 
from deep center. It was time to put 
on the jets if I wanted to ,core the 
winning run. 

Stillw3nting to be the hero, 1 ran 
right past our third base coach who 
was screaming at lIle to StOp. I raced 
toward the pia te juSt as the shortstop 
was making the throw home. 

I, of course, was safe - did you 
really think I'd tell that long-ass 
story if I had been Ollt? We won the 
game and I wa> carried off the field 
and worshipped as a hero for the 
next few days. It was great fun . 

The purpose of Illy storv is to 
convi nce you to go Olit and partic-
I pa te in sports on ca mplls. There 
is norhing in rhe world like the 
thrill of competition Jnd having 
fun wirh some friends. 

Men's soccer ends streak 
C U Bakersfield beats Tritons, UC 0 falls to 4-8 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UC D men's soccer team's 
winning streak ended Oct. 5 with a 
0-4 loss to Cal State Bakersfield. 

In front of a crowd of ovcr 400 
people in Bakersfield , the 
Roadrunners produced their biggest 
offensive output of the season, out-

~hootin!! the Triton> 12- 10 and ,cor-
ing over three goals tor the first time 
this season. 

Roadrunner Mark Melling, from 
Preston, England, got Bakersfield 
srarted early, sending a cros pass to 
Annondo ,\I! orale> who headed it 
into the net only II minute into the 
game for Ius tealil 's first goal. 

TIle Roadrunners' second goal 
came in the 32nd minute, when 
Alfredo Chavez capitalized on some 
nifty passes by his teammate to give 
Bakersfi eld a 2 -0 lead. 

The Tritons lost a man in the 

38th minute after junior defender 
Burkc Fathy wa, ejccred for an ille-
gal tackle. The Roadnulilcrs capital-
ized, scoring or\" a header hy 
Lawrence Mi>e3vich off a corner 
kick. 

In the second half, the UCSD 
defense stepped it up a noteh and 
helll Bakersfield scoreless until 
the 83rd minute, when Alex 
Camacho cored for the 
Roadrunners to sea l the victory. 
The Tritons had several scoring 
opportunities in the beginning of 
the second half, but were unable 
to takc adva ntage . 

freshman Roadrunner goa lie 
earned the shu tout by posting three 
saves, while Jeremy Cookson tallied 
one save for UCSD. 

With the loss, thc Tritons fall to 
4-8 overall and 4-6 in the CCAA. 
Cal State Bakersfield evens its 
rccord to 7-7 overa ll and 4-4 in the 
CCM.

Women's soccer wins 
Tritons improve record to 10-1 
by ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team received an unexpected 
battle from Cal State Bakersfield 
last Friday, who played the 
Tritons wholeheartedly before 
10 ing 1-2 . 

The Roadrunners stunned the 
Tritons right off the bat, scoring 
with a penetrating run by fresh-
man Lindsay Bush barely a 
minute into the game. 

Despite missing its all -CCAA 
defender Allison Doorn, who is 
out due to injury, the CSU 
Bakersfield defense contained 

the Tritons' offense, allowing . 
only one shot on goal in the first 
half. 

However, the second half was 
another story, as miscommunica-
tion killed the 'Runners' defense 
and allowed the Tritons to score 
two goals and take back the lead. 

The Tritons' first goal was just 
as startling as CSU Bakersfield's, 
and came off of their second-half 
kickoff. The Tritons sent a long 
kick toward the Roadrunner goal, 
and a lapse in communication 
between two defenders and the 
Bakersfield goalie gave Triton

because 
I said 0 

W hen I was in sixth grade, 
my class played 
our school's other 
sixth grade class in 
a softball game. 
This was not just 
any softball gamer 
but a heated rival-
ry between two 
classes of bitter 
enemies. Winning 
that game was the 
most important 
thing in any of our 
young lives. 

Winrung the game would give 
• us bragging rights for the rest of 

the school year. To lose would 
mean shame and humiliation for 
the rest of our lives - or at least 
until the big basketball game. 

As we emered the bottom of 
the seventh - we were only 
going seven innings - it did not 
look good for our team. We were 
down by three runs with the bot-
tom of our order coming up. I 
was due up sixth in the inning. 

In my mind 's eye, I could see 
myself getting the storybook 
ending and getting the game-
winning hit with two Outs. I 
really wanted to . be the hero. 
You know how they say to be 
careful what you wish for? Well, 
I was about to find out just what 
they mean by that. 

Through some miracle, our 
last batter in the order, a big-
boned boy named O scar, roped 
a single to deep center. It prob-
ably would have been a triple for 
anyone else, but Oscar was a 
large fellow. That miracle was 
followed by two si ngles that 
loaded the bases with two out 
and us down by three. Guess 
who ca me up next. 

I remember being surprising-
ly calm as I strode to the plate. I 
stepped into the batter's box and 
did my best to look tough. I 
kicked dirt all over the fresh ly 
dusted home plate, which only 
angered my teacher, who had to 
come out and clean it again. 

As the first pitch left the 
pitcher's hand, I was completely 
focused. The cheers of my fel -
low classmates were muted by 
my extreme concentration. The 
background seemed to blur as I 
remained focused on the ball. I 
took a giant step and uncorked a 
Herculean swing. Had I made 
contact with that ball, it would 
still be going. As it happened, it 
was an embarrassing whiff and 
strike one. - -

After uttering an impressive 
display of expletives to myself for 
missing an underhand pitch, I 
regained my composure and took 
my stance for the second pitch. 

As the pitch was released, I 
could feel every muscle in my 
body working as one. The con-
