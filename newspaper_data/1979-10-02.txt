,.---~-------But Overall Enrollment is Up 

Sciences Ha ve Shortfall of Women 
By Barry Meepol 

lnere will be Ijttle change in a two year-old 
study which found no increase in the percenlage 
of female majors enrolled in pure and applied 
science fields and other areas historically 
dominated by men, says Robert StarKey, 
UCSD analytical studies officer, . 

The report, made from 1970 to 1977, 
compared enrollment tren(Js by major and sex 
in a study similar to one conducted at UC 
Davis. 

Another study will probably be made here 
within the next few months, Starkey says, but 
"it looks like there's no great change from the 
'77 study." 

Unlike-the UCSD study, UC Davis' found a 
shift over time of women in science and 
administration related fie.lds. Thi was the result 
of "the women's movement, awareness of 
expanded options and broadened perspectives 
of life, increased interest in career-oriented 
fields, increased job opportunities and 
decreased demand for teachers," their report 
suggested.

campuswide, as a result of increaled female 
enrollment at the University. 

During the seven-year period of the study, 
total female enrollment rose seven percent, 
from 33 percent in 1970 to 40 percent in 1977, 
an increase comparable to nationwide figures. 

Paralleling the improved overall 
representation of women in upper division 
majors, female enrollment in the math-science 
disciplines increased seven percent, from 22 to 
29 percent, and in the humanities from 51 
percent to 58 percent. A rise slightly above the 
campus average was also found in the social 
sciences, which rose nine percent-from 39 
percent in 1970 to 48 percent in 1977. 

The most dramatic increase was found in the 
arts, which rose 21 percent, from 33 percent in 
1970 to 54 percent in 1977. These figures are 
misleading,- though, says Starkey, as they 
reflect the small percentage of women enrolled 
in the arts in 1970, and the relatively small 
growth of .arts departments during the recent 

. seven-year period. 

Although the UCSD study did not find the 
same results, it showed an increase in the 
overall representation of women in upper 
division majors in nearly all departments 

While total female enrollment i, up here, women ,till lag 
behind men in the sciences. 

Within individual departments, above-
average improvements in female enrollment 
were found in AMES, Biology and Chemiltry 
among the scie.nces, and in Economics,

Pub Enforcement Problems 
Escape Government Notice 
Board Official Says H e Thought It Wasn't Open 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

While management at UCSD's first pub ay 
it is carefully prote ting its liquor license by 
checking and 80m tJmes rechecking student's 
identification, the Alcoholic Reveral!e Control 
claims that it has thus far ignored operations at 
the beer and wine vending facility. 

Walk Sellek, manager of "Walk's Place at 
the Pub ," is "almost certain" that ABC 
representatives have been in to monitor alcohol 
sales since th pub s opening September 1 7. 

Until yesterday, however, the ABC was not 
aware the pub had begun busin ss, a cording 
to Warren Tankersl y, the AB acting district 
administrator who originall super vi 'ed 
licensing of the facility. Now that he knows the 
pub is open, however. " I imagine there will b 
people watching it," he says. 

Altho.ugh " Walk" Place" might be expected 
to attract rnor under -21 customers than many 
alcohol facilities, the ABC will monitor it "no 
more than any other place," Tankersley says. 
But if the pub "get's sloppy, th n they will run 
into problems, " he adds . 

" Probl ms" rang from suspension of th 
facility's be r and wine license to complet 
revocation. 

The AS can also fine liquor-selling 
establishmenls exten 'ively for serving alcoholic 
drinks to minors. Such fin s are based on the 
number of days a fa 'ility would have been 
suspended, multiplied by 20 percent of the 
establishment's av rage daily sales, 
Tcmkersley says. 

But if UC D's pub runs as smoothly as its 
counterpart. San Diego tatc's "Goldy's" it will 
not need to worry about licens penalties, 
Tankersley says. "Goldy's" under the same 
man<lgement as U l)'s pub, has had "no 
problems" with the ABC, he explains. 

Pub employees hel v • had trouble preventin~

Yesterday Sellek announced that he will take 
away alcoholic drinks from minors, and if legal 
drinkers_ persist in giving beer or wine to 
I mderaged student., "the whole tabl will be 
kicked out." 

"The school's jusl got too much at stake ," he 
says. "We won't lose (the pub) just because 
adults are giving drinks to minors." 

Sellek also says he will refuse service to any 
cu ' tomer appearing intoxicated , as per state 
law. 

Though Sellek say the pub is having 80m 
problems establishing mooth operating

Cafe, UC Separated by More Than Miles 
By Eric Jaye 

Our parents and the state of 
California spend thousands of 
dollars on our four or five 
t'ears of . college . with th~ 
justifiable assumption that It 
will give us some intellectual 
lalle is editor 01 The (j(Jily 
GUGrdian. 
edge on everybOdy else. 

No one has ever spent a 
cent trying to make critical 
think. of the patrons of the 
Family Kitchen Cafe in Solana 
Beach. 

Guess what. We don't think 
a whole lot like they do. . 

As the national elections 
approach and we are all left 
wondering just what is going to 
happen at the poUs next year, 
it is important to try and bridge 
the more than just ten miles 
that separate UCSD and the 
Family Kitchen, the favorite 
breakfast spot for working 
people from up and down the 
North County coasl 

The Family Kitchen opens 
at 6 am, a time when most of 
us are still aieeping off last 
night's poJi sci homework, and 
it closes after lunch at 2 pm. It 
isn't open for dinner, since 
decent people should be home 
with their families 'at that hour. 

It'. a unall restaurant, filled 
up by a counter, a few tables 
and chairs and an oversized 
19SOs.vintage juke box that 
features the Glenn Miller 
recording of "Begin the 

,Beguine." The place is ~lIy 
the Pacific anchor of a stnng ot 
small family restaurants with 
deer antlers on the walls and 
swing on the jukebox. 

These people, the cowboys 
and carpe,lters and assort-
ment of other manual laborers, 
a~e generally, if you want to 
believe the statis ti cs, 
conservative Republicans of 
the type that would make your 
parents look like flower-child 
Democrats . 

These people didn't go to 
college. They watch television 
30 hours a week, have 2.2 
children and make love 1.5 
times a week. They are 
something we are not: typical 
Americans. 

The junior political

commentators I spend my 
time with in coffee shops 
(where they call the coffee 
espresso and charge three 
times as much tor it) are 
haVIng trouble interpreting the 
polls that show Richard Nixon 
would beat President Carter in . 

'an election and the 
, distressingly strong showing of 
other right-wing paranoids like 
Ronald Reagan and John 
Connally. 

I was also having trouble 
understanding the dangerous 
political trends that are taking 
hold in this country. It is a 
mood that would abolish 
welfare and leave people to 
starve on the streets, all in the 
name of rugged individualism 
and no government interfer-

.. 

ence. _ 
lhat's probably because up 

on these bluffs , with only 
opinion polls to tell us what the 
rest of the world is thinking , it 
is easy to forget that all those 
crazy political views don't 
exist in a vacuum; every 
political perspective needs 
someone to espouse it. 

That's what we're not 
taught. We can analyze a 
political trend , but not the 
people who make it up. And 
why should we? It's much 
easiers to be a snotty liberal 
condemning those with 
different political "iews. 

For all the rponey shelled 
out to train us to think, very 
little goes to giving us a sense 
of the concerns of the people 

• "" .. -~ 

who pay a t least part of that 
money. 

If we are to gain any politcal 
understanding we should 
spe'nd a little more time, both 
in and out of school. with the 
people who are the arms and 
legs of the body politic. 

If we did , it might solve a 
few problems. If the university 
spent more time addressing 
the non -intellectual masses it 
would make them less wary of 
paying out taxes to UC and 
give us all some valuable 
perspective. 

We are being sent here to 
learn to think. Hut think for 
whom? For the people of the 
state, the people in the Family 
Kitchen would say. Of course. 
they mean by ' that that we 
should reflect their views in the 
university_ I, for one, am not 
quite ready for that. But I think 
the university and the people 
of the state should spend a GtUe 
more time trying to convince 
one another who is right.

In Tanzania's struggle for 

independence, President 
Nyerere found his most solid 
support among the Muslim 
community in Dar es Salaam. 

In the Congo Claire) the 
centers of militant nationalism 
were in Stanleyville. Kindu 
and the Kasonga areas - a ll 
militantly Islamic . 

In Egypt, Nasser quoted 
from the Koran to propagate 
his brand of socialilll1l, and in 
Algeria it was the ban against 
Koranic leaching that finally 
sparked the armed struggle 
against the French. 

In Zaire today, as in the 
Cameroon, the most tenacious 
lib era t ion m 0 v,e men t s 
opposing foreign influence 
remain predominantly 
Muslim. 

An today in Egypt, Sudan 
and all across Africa -
expecially in those nations 
where open political 
opposition is banned - an 
underground Islamic move-
ment called the Muslim 
Brotherhood is gaining a size 
and strength that will soon be 
capable of erupting into a 
militant political forte at any 
time. 

To many Westerners, such 
a prospect conjures fears of an 
Arab.dominated, global. 
spanning religious force that is 
vehemently anti-,Western. 
Some tee in it an easy analogy 
to the West's own riM! to 
international power 1 ,000 
years ago, and the rapid 
spread of Christianity which 
coincided with it. 

Are the oil-rich Arab States 
- the home of Islam - now 
expanding. their new economic 
and political muscle throul(h 
the spread of Islam? Is Africa 
itllelf turninu toward the 

political as well as the religious 
magnetism of Mecca? 

Such fears spring fl'lm 
equati n g . Isl am wi~h 
Christianity without recogniz-
ing that Islam, unlike the 
Catholicism that swept over 
the West , bows to no central 
a uthority. 

Throughout history, 
wherever the nower of Islam 
has taken root, it has grown 
into a native plant, not an 
Arabian hybrid. Islam' has 
flourished in )\frica l\O.t 
because of the Arabs, but in 
spite of them. 

Arab rulers and merchant 
adventurers over the centuries 
_ far from enhancing the 
spirit and image of. Islam ~ 
Africa - degraded It by their 
p r a ct ice s 0 f sl a very; 
exploitation and subjugatiO!': 
To this day. anywhere at 
Africa, an Arab is suspect. " 

Islam took root in Afric!, 
because Africans found il 
broadly in keeping with the!r

primarily that of. loyally. t~ t~ 
communily. Unlike Chrisbana-
ty, which came to Africa via a 
highly industrialized ~r~ 
and was teen as a ngicly 
hierarchical and individualized 
religion with a "personal" 
GoCI, Islam reflected the 
patlerns and values 01 a pre-
industrial world. 

In contrast to the CatholK' 
church, Islam never "eeded a 
hierarchical center like Rome

"I told the government of the United States - and I

Sadat, Jackson Meet 
CAIRO, Egypt - President Anwar Sadat met with 
US black activist leader Jesse Jackson yesterday and 
said he welcomed any effort to settle the Palestinian 
problem. But he added there was "no urgency" for 
Palestinians joining the tri-partite autonomy talks. 

" " 's not urgent today or tomorrow or until we reach 
agreement on autonomy," Sadat told reporters shortly 
before his closed~oor meeting with Jackson and his 
17 -member delegation. 

"But whenever the electionliStart , it is then their full 
responsibility to participate," Sadat said. 

WASHINGTON - President Carter said last night 
that the United States will increase its military prese~ce 
in the Caribbean, but he told the na tion that the 
controversy involving Soviet troops in Cuba "is 
certainly no reason for a return to the Cold War." 

He reiterated that during recent negotiations, Soviet 
officials ha ve insisted that the troops do not make up a 
combat force. 

In the broadcast report on the troop controversy, 
Carter declared that "the grea test danger to American 
security tonighl is certainly not the 2,000 or 3,000 
Soviet troops in Cuba ." Instead , he said, it is l he 
possibility of a "breakdown of a common effort" with 
Moscow to preserve peace and reduce the da nger of 
nuclear war. 

Calling anew on 'the Senate to ratify the strategic 
arms limitation treaty, the president said rejection of 
SALT II "would seriously compromise our nation's 
peace and security" and leave allies in Europe 
"confused and deeply alramed." 

Pope Begins Visit 
BOSTON - Pope John Paul II opened his visit to his 
divided American flock yesterday, raising a 
shepherd's crozier to bless a drenched but ecstatic 
c rowd in Boston. 

" I greet you, America the Beautiful, " the pope told a 
cheering throng in Boston Common in the first major 
address of his six-city U.s tour. " I wantlo tell everyone 
that the pope is your friend ." 

He hailed America as a free and generous land, but 
said its youth was being lured from religion to the

and indifference. 

Canyon Plant OKed 
WALNUT CREEK - In a defeat tor nuclear power 
foes, a federal report concludes the Diablo Canyon 
nuclear plant can withstand the largest earthquake

The plant's owner, Pacific Gas & Electric, will 
renew its petition 10 the NRC to license the twin 
reactors, said Dick Davin, a utility spokesman in San 
Francisco . 

In an initial 94-page decision issued in Washington 
D.C .. the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board said the 
plant , constructed nearly 100 percent on coastal 
bluffs, could withstand a temblor of 7.5 magnitude on 
the Richter scale, the NRC's regional office said. 

Geologists say that is the largest which the recently 
discovered offshore HosllTi Fault could 2'enerate. The 
plant is located along the California coastline in San

SAN DIEGO - About a dozen federal inmates

At least three prisoners, reportedly those whose

solitary confinement for refusing to work. . 

The three reportedly refused to eat or work since last 
Friday. Assistant Lowell Kinkaid declined 10 say if 
other inmates were being punished but said "any who 
refuse to work will be given solitary confinement." 

"The number of those not eating is insignificant." 
Kinkaid said, describing them as "a few."

Steve Martin's New 
Stuff Already Stale 

by Rick Greene 

The title of comic Steve 
Martin's new album, released 
by Warner Brothers thii week, 
is Comedy Is Not Prelly. That 
mayor may not be true, but in 
the case of this latest recorded 
effort, comedy is not funny 
either. Martin has released a 
new album of hi. old material 
each Fall for the past three 
FaUs, and the first, 1977's 
Let's Get Small, seemed 
genuinely funny at the time. 
By 1978's A Wild And Crazy 
Guu, most people were gelling 
tired of Steve Martin, and 
although the album sold as 
well as it's predecessor, it was 
only mildly funny at best and 
more than a bit repetitious. 
Now, 1979 brings us Comedy 
Is Not Pretlll, and even if you 
haven't heard the album yet, 
you've heard the album. 

the album package indudes 
the obligatory free giveaway 
poster, amusing linear notes 
and pictures of Steve making 
funny faces. The album cover, 
Steve in drag, is especially 
grotesque. But this time. 
unlike his other two outings, 
the audience is wise to him. 
The laughter is forced and 
feeble, and they boo him more

tape recorder and plays hack 
the previous bit. "Hey", he 
says, "this guy's good!" If he 
only were. 

Steve Martin 
In short , Comedy IS as 

boring as a dial·tone . Steve 
Martin is a man on the way 
out , and he has only one more 
chance to turn his flash·in ·the·

trilogy that gets weaker and 
more famdiar 811 it goes on. 

The album begins abruptly, 
with no introduction, as if 
beginning where we left off last 
time. Steve's material simply 
isn't funny . We already know 
he has his own hostages, and 
that he can turn dog shit into 
gold. We know he was born to 
be wild and that he holds up a 
poster of Farrah with one 
hand. Martin seems to have 
this fetish about recording 
every word he has ever said on 
any program, talk show or 
special, as opposed to coming 
up with something original. If 
he tried to breathe some life 
into these records, perhaps do 
something along the lines of 
The Firesign Theatre, then he 
might be able to revitalize his 
own tired career. The high

Eliminates Duplication 
A side benefit of illS is that 

it eliminates duplication of 
work already done by others. 
This is "a pressing recurrent 
problem in developing 
curriculum material," says 
Alfred Bork, professor of 
physics and computer science 
at UC Irvine. Bork is an 

innovative instructor himself, 
having p.roduced computer· 
base d science teachin g 
material that is now routinely 
being used in large beginning 
courses at UC Irvine. 

Bork says that teachers and 
administrators who are 
planning to develop improved 
teaching projects are the most 

against his own c1an, - the 
powerful and corrup t 
Quraishis • 

The Muslim ' s own 
holybook, the Koran , 
cas tigated the privileged 
Arabs (the Beduin) as " the 
worst sinners a·nd hypocrites." 

If Muhammad were to re-
emerge today, he would 
certainly lead a new struggle 
against the sheikhs, and 
monarchs whose oil money is 
now freely changing hands in 
casinos· and nightclubs from 
Beirut to u's Vegas. for 

Muhammad in his time was 
moved , above all , by deep 
social anger a t squandered 
wealth, oppression of the 
weak, and the arrogance of thE; 
mighty. Islam succeeded 
because its message made 
sense to both Arab and 
Afric.an; it was. intelligible and 
persuastve because it was 
relevant to the people's own 
experience . 

And it is re·emerging in 
Africa today for the same 
reasons . The new leaders of 
the independent Afr ican states 
introduced secular education 
for all, and the Muslims, for 
the first time in centuries, took 
full advantage of it. Nassar 
opened Egypt's colleges, 
universities and technical 
schools to Muslim students 
from all over Africa , and most 

of these students are now back

influence.

Computer Knows .2,800 Teaching Ideas 
Colleges and university 

teachers, students and 
administrators in California 
can now exchange ideas and 
information about new 
teaching programs by 
browsing through a computer 
printout. 

Descriptions of more than 
2,800 innovative teac~ng 
projects at the state's 
community cdlleges, coUeges 
and universities are available 
on a central data base 
coordinated at the University 
of California. Santa Barbara 
ca~s. 

The project, called the 
Instructional Improvement 
Information Service (illS). 
grew from a need to exchange 
information about developing 
new teaching programs. the 
data base wasltarted in 1974 
by the UC President's 
Advisory committee on 
Instructional Improvement, 
which received funds from UC 
and the state_ The service is 
now in its fifth year and' serves 
as a model in higher 
education. 

How it works 
A professor at Cal State 

Hayward needs to develop a 
course on ancient Greek 
history. Ther.e is one problem, 
though: he wants to offer the 
dau to first-year students, and 
many of them will be spending 
a good deal of their time in 
basic english composition 
classes. How to combine the 
two needs? 

Professor X can telephone 

his campus illS center, and a 
trained person will search the 
computer data base for a 
course that combines both 
Eqglish and ancient Greek 
history. Or he can go directly 
to the computer terminal for 
illS on his campus and with a 
User's Manual, he can search 
the data base himself using the 
keywords Humanities+ 
English+ Basic Skills. 

The data base will show 
there is a course being 
developed in Humanities/Eng-
lish Composition at the UC 
San Diego campus. The· 
program's developers and 
their title" are listed on the 
printed abstract Professor X 
receives in case he wants to 
contact them. 

A short description of the 
teaching project is even 
included on the abstract: "A 
new humanities course," it 
reads, "concentrating on the 
history, literature and 
philosophy of the Semitic and 
Greek cultures of antiquity. A 
required writing laboratory will 
also be developed." 

The computer abstract also 
indicates a 19-page report 
with more details about the 
project is available. Funds 
requested to develop the 
project and the amount 
actually awarded are on the 
printout as well. 

To keep users of the service 
informed of new projects, 
campus representatives 
receive monthly updates. 
And project directors are sent

Cooperation Among 
State Schools 

California's postsecondary 
public education is adminis-
tered by three different 
entities. There is the nine-
campus University of 
California system; the 19 
campus California State 
University and Colleges 
(CSUC) system; and the 
California community college 

In recent years. the state 
legislature has emphasized the 
need for greater cooperation 
among these three segments of 
higher education. The illS, 
says John M. Anderson, 
administrator of the service for 
UC, is one "open area where 
intersegmental cooperation 
has increased significantly. 

, "UC and CSUC have taken 
the primary coordinating role 
in this process," he adds. "A

almost impossible to make the break from 
college to the pre's," he said. Kloppenburg 
hopes that the position will eventually lead to an 
assistant 'coaching job on the Sonics. 

Kloppenburg was asked by Seattle and 
assistant coach Les Habeggar to _ fill the 
position . Kloppenburg and Habeggar met and 

established a friendship while coaching against 
each other in the NAIA playoffs when 
Habeggar was coaching at Seattle Pacific and 
Kloppenburg at USIU. 

Six recruits from j':lnior colleges throus.hout 
the state enrolled in UCSD this fall after 
Kloppenburg's winter recruiting drive. 

Some of the recruits are e~pressmg 
disappointment at Kloppenburg 's decision to 
go. Nathan Forte. a junior transfer from 
Antelope Valley Junior College outside of Los 
Angeles, said Carter seems "all right" as a 
coach but adds that he came to play basketball 
under Kloppenburg. 

" A lot of (the 'players) are really 
disappointed ," said Foirte. "Some are saying 
they wish they hadn 't come here." 

"But I'm not down on him for taking the job ," 
he says. "I would have done the same thing." 

Carter is no newcomer to UCSD basketball . 
After playing here , he became the women's 
coach. Now he heads the basketball program at 
Ramona High School , where he is a vice-
principal. He also assists Kloppenburg during 
the summer in coaching at the Idyllwild 
Basketball Camp, a program for 'high school 
and junior high school age players held 
annually at UCSD. 

Kloppenburg thinks his successor will "do a 
fine job, particularly with the talent level of the 
players," which he calls the best group of 
players to ever come to UCSD. 

" He's a very good, young coach," 
Kloppenburg said of Carter. " He 
communicates extremely well and he 's a very 
positive thinker ."
