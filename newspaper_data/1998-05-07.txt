UC Accepts 3,179 More Students 
ADMITS: Underrepresented 
racial minority groups 
constitute 19.6 percent 
By Julia Kull.Mader 
Co-News Editor 

In an attempt to fulfill the University of 
California's commitment to provide a place at 
one of it campu es to all UC-eligible 
California applicants, an additional 3,179 high 
school seniors have been admitted to the uni-
versity for the 1998-99 academic year. 

These students - 19.6 percent of whom are 
from underrepresented racial minority groups 
- were admitted during the second stage of the 
admissions process. 

During the second phase, UC admissions 
officers try to place UC-eligible students who 
were not admitted to their desired campuses. 

Out of the 3S7 students admitted to UCSD 

during the second stage, two arc Native 
Ameri can, 16 are African American, 22 are 
Chicano, 13 are Latino, 87 are Asian American, 
164 are Caucasian and 53 declined to state their 
race or ethnicity. 

Of the admitted students, 1,571 have been 
offered admission for the ·fall. The rest were 
admitted for the winter and spring terms. 

UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC 
Riverside, UC Santa Barbara, UC Santa Cruz 
and UCSD all offered admission to some of the 
second-wave students. 

During the first wave of admissions, UC 
Berkeley accepted 2,476 more students for 
spring semester and UCLA admitted 681 more 
students for the winter quarter than last year~_ 

C. Judson King, UC provost and senior vice 
president for academic affairs, said the admit-
ted students deserve to attend the University of 
California.

UCSD Wins 
For Minimal 
Alcohol Use 
PREVENTION: Automobile 
Club honors UCSD for 
responsible drinking habits 
By Ryan Olson 
Co·News Editor 

UCSD is the recipient of the first annual 
College and Univer 'ity Drinking and Driving 
Prevention award given by the Automobile 
Club of Southern California and the Higher 
Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug 
Prevention. 

UCSD offic ials accepted the $1,000 award 
during a ceremony yesterday outside the 
Marshall College Administration Building. The 
results of a new survey measuring UCSD stu-
dents' drinking and associated behavior were 
also released. 

UCSD fonned a team of students called 
Creating Responsible Alcohol Services and 
Habits (C.R.A.S.H.), which then worked to 
reduce driving under the influence (DUI) and to 
inform students about responsible beverage 
usage. 

C.R.A.S.H. member ' coordinated several 
activities including a "C.R.A.S.H. Course in 
Party Planning," in which students and bever-
age servers learned about serving alcohol 
responsibly and safely. 

Activities similar to those initiated by the 
C.R.A.S.H. team continue today as the 
Celebrating Healthy Environments ttJrough the 
Empowerment of Responsible Students 
(C.H.E.E.R.S.) program. C.H.E.E.R.S. is a part 
of the "Five Colleges - One Community" pro-
ject started last year. 

"C.R.A.S.H. was instrumental in getting 
UCSD to take a long look at the issue of binge 
drinking on campus for the first time in many 
years," said Lupe Samaniego-Kraus, director of 
health education at the Student Health and 
Wellness Center. "We succeeded by building 
awareness among students, staff and faculty 
and by crealing a solid foundation to address

RESEARCH: Findings 
are publi hed in 
Biological Psychiatry 
By Annam Manthlram 
Staff Wriler 

Daniel Kripke, a professor of 
psychiatry at Ihe UCS D School of 
Medici ne, and hi s associa tes 
recenlly published a paper in the 
journal Biological Psychiatry, 
reporting a l:onnel: ti on between the 
use of prescription sleeping pills 
and an increased risk of death 

"I would say Ihat laking sleep-
ing pills long term is a form of 
assisted suic ide," Kripke said. 

The data for Kripke's slUdy was 
obta ined from the Ameril:an 
Cancer So(;ie ty's Cancer 
Prevention Study II. which sur-
veyed roughly 1.1 mi llion people 
bet ween 1982 and 1988 and was 
des igned primarily to examine can-
cer ri sks such as cigarelle smoking. 
The survey included data on the 
usage of prescription sleeping pills. 

Researchers checked mortality 
rates of the participants every other 
year. 

"What we found is that people 
who said they were taking sleeping 
pills were more likely to have died 
during the follow-up period ," 
Kripke said. 

T he si udy considered 31 fac -
tors, includi ng age, race, exercise, 
smoking and hi story of hearl di s-
ea e and cancer. Researchers round 
that men and women who reported 
using sleepi ng pills at leasl 30 
limes per month had about a 29 
percenl increased death ri sk . 

When the researchers consid-
ered only age and ge nder, they con-
cluded that the sleeping pill lIsers 
death risk was about three limes 
greater wilhi n a six ·year fo llow·up 
period than for non-users. 

Howevcr, Kripke and hi s associ -
ates noted Ii milS on the connection 
bet ween an im.:reased risk or death 
and the usc of prescriplion sleeping 
pi lls. Many faclors were nOI con· 
trolled for the study, such as psychi-

utric and sleeping disorders. and 
some risk ractors may not have been 
measured :Idequalely. Kripke said. 

Also. he nOled thai dirferent sla-
tistical methods provide different 
eSlimales of the amount of risk . 
The mcthod controll ing for onl y 
age and gender may have overesti -
mated the ri sk, whi le coni rolling 
for 31 factors may have underesli -
mated Ihe risk. Kripke said. 

"Demonslration of an associa ti on 
of increased dcath rates wi th sleep-
ing pill usc docs not prove that the 

. sleeping pills ~aused the deaths," 
Kripke said. "Also, this study did nOl 
idcnliry which particular sleeping 
pills the participants were taking. 

" II is possible Ihat somc sleep-
ing pi ll s carry a morta li ty risk an I 
that others arc sare," he added. 

Also, the panicipants in volved 
in the survey were not a random 
sample, hut a group of people thai 
the American Cancer Societ y cou Id 
follow for six years.

By Christine Pangan 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD students may eventually 
have to dial the number "I ," the area 
code, then the seven-digit number to 
ca ll someone down the hall if state 
regulators adopt one of three new 
area code plans being considered. 

Plans to add new area codes 
have ari sen due to increased com-
pelition and cuslOmer demand for 
phone numbers in the San Diego 
area 10 serve new te lecommunica-
lion tec hnologies such as modems, 
pagers, fax machines , PCS and cel-
lular phones. Assigning new area 
codes to these technologies has 
been han ned hy the FCC.

boards held public meetings in La 
Mesa, Chula Vista, Poway and San 
Diego in April to discuss three pro-
posed 619 area code changes wi lh 
communily members. 

Under the "ovcrlay" proposal , 
parts or San Diego (i ncluding EI 
Cajon, La Mesa, Chula Vista and 
Coronado) would receive a new 
area code. The remaining areas. 
including downtown San Diego, 
Mission Valley, La Jolla, Del Mar 
and Mira Mesa would be "over-
laid" with two area codes. 

Arter 619 numbers run out, new 
numbers wou ld receive a new area 
code. Those who currently have Ihe 
619 area code wou ld retain it. 

Under the plan, there would no 
longer be any seven·digit dia ling. 
For example, if a caller was call ing 
someone in the 619 area code. they 
wou ld need 10 includc I and 619 
wi th the normal phone number 
whcn dialing. 

"Everyone in the overlay area 
will have to dial the II digits -

" I" plus Ihe area code plus the 
seven-digit number ... regardless of 
whether or not the person being 
cal led has the same area code," said 
Risa Hernandez, a representative of 
the CPUc. 

The other two plans ca ll for a 
three-way geographic sp lit into 
north San Diego (including La 
Jolia, Del Mar, Mira Mesa and 
Poway), central San Diego, which 
includes downtown and areas south 
or Inlerslate 8, and east San Diego 
(La Mesa, EI Cajon) and Chula 
Visla and Coronado. 

The three-way split wou ld cre-
ate two new area codes ror San 
Diego County, wilh ei ther cenlral 
or east San Diego retaining the 619 
area l:ode and Ihe remaining two 
seclions rec.:e iving new area codes. 
In either case. nort h San Diego 
wou ld receive a new area c.:ode. 

According 10 HcrnandcJ:, Ihe 
proposed area l:ode changes shou ld 
not affect presen t call rates .

Volunteering Will Benefit 
Students and San Diego 

A recent report by a UCSD corporate focus group 
showed that many UCSD graduates, though well-edu-
cated, lack social and business skills which would 
make them more valuable in the workplace. The report 
suggested that students should be more involved with 
internships and programs that prompt them to learn 
"people skills" and other valuable business tactics. 

It is a goal of this university to prepare its students 
for their entrance into the workforce, and reports like 
this one seem to show that the university has failed to 
educate students in one valuable category - working 
with other people. 

A community-service graduation requirement 
would benefit both the university and the community. 

The most noticeable effect of this requirement would 
be the thousands of hours in community service the tu-
denL~ would provide to San Diego. Organizations such 
as Mama's Kitchen, which provides meals to people 
with AIDS, would benefit from students' services. 
Homeless shelters, schools and countless other pro .. 
grams would prosper with the help of the students. 

Students would benefit by learning to work with 
people whom they would otherwise never meet. 
Experiences like volunteering to lead children's pro-
grams at the San Diego Zoo would teach student~; 
many skills. Working with children would teach them 
how to lead others, and working under zoo employees 
would teach them how to interact in a profess ional 
environmenl. These skills are invaluable in today's 
workplace. 

A community-service graduation requirement 
would also give students a chance to leam more about 
the fields they have chosen to pursue. Volunteering is 
not limited to soup kitchens and picking up trash at the 
park, however - students can volunteer at biochemi-
cal labs, hospitals or local schools. 

These experiences can give students an idea of the 
careers they are about to enter and help them decide 
whether their chosen fields of study are where their 
interests lie. Some may realize they have found their 
true calling, and the volunteer service would give them . 
a step up when it comes to acquiring a job upon grad-
uation. Those who find they don't enjoy volunteer 
work in their major would have the opportunity to 
switch into a major they really appreciate. 

A realistic community-service program would 
require 30 to 50 hours of service to be completed 
before students end their second year. This would give 
them plenty of time to fulfill the hourly requirement 
early enough that they could easily switch majors if 
they chose to do so. 

A community-service graduation requirement 
would benefit more than the community; students 
would receive more practical experience than they 
could ever leam in the classroom.

INCREASED FRUSTRATION IS THE 
TRAGIC RESULT OF SILLY GAMES 

COMMENTARY: When it comes to issues as complex as dating, it pays to be 
forthright and communicative; you may save a valuable friendship in the process 

JESSYCA 
WALLACE 

Messing With 
Your Mind 

It's been a whi Ic since I've served 
the UCSD community with my self-
aggrandized wisdom regarding dating, 
but I figure you must certainly be ready 
for ancther heaping dose by now. 

The last time I decided to grace you 
with my theories of communication, 
risk -taking and understanding our 
fears - as they pertain to dating - I 
knew surprisingly lillie about what pit-
falls laid before me on the dating 
scene. Now [ can safely assume, while 
my experiences since then have taught 
me valuable lessons. that [ sti II know 
nothing. 

I believed briefly that the most dif-
ficult and ridiculous parl of dating was 
playing "the game." While this bastion 
of insanity still poses problem after 
problem in regard to my social interac-
tion with both members of the oppo-
site se)( and my own, it somehow 

seem~ insignificant when I am faced 
with the annoying, inconsiderate and 
outrighi deceptive actions of real peo-
ple. Oh wait, that is "the game." 

I ask my fcllow singles, what is the 
point of playing games'! There are two 
commonly held objectives of dating of 
which I am aware. Neither requires 
playing games, as far as I can tell . 

The lirst - and most commonly 
held - objcctive of daling is to find a 
life partner. Many young peoplc just 
want to find the right person, sell Ie 
down and never date again (I attribute 
thi s to the inability of many of our par-
ents to do so). They see dating as a 
mcans of finding the perfect boyfriend 
or girlfriend who wi II then lead to the 

To cit. anoth.r 
example of my dating 
foible. that point. me 
toward believing that 
men forc. women to 
play gam ••••• In a fit 
of fr.aklsh obse .. lon 
at a tim. of .xtr.me 
vuln.rabillty, I 
unabashedly told two 
of my frI.nds of my 
burning d.slr. to bring 
thoH friendships to a 
more Intimate lev.l. 
perfect husband or wife. 

Aside from the obvious tlaws with 
this outlook on dating, it retlects a nar-
row view of life experience and an 
evcn more narrow view of the partici-
pants' life goals. How broad could 
these peoplc's e)(periences ever be if 
they only value dating as mate-testing,! 

Even if you feel that this "ultimatc 
goal" actually ~ the point of dating, I 
implore you, is it really necessary to 
engage in childish, noncommunicative 
games to find your dates'! 

The second - and most immedi-
ately satisfying objective - is to gct 
laid. For anyone who ascribes to the 
theory that having sex is the primary 
reason to go on a date, games really 
ought to be irrclevant. It should be as 
easy as saying, "I think you're hot, let's 
get it on," or some version of thaI. 
What it doesn ' t need to involve is tak-
ing a girl out, gelling her drunk and 
taking her back to your apartment. This 
seems to be the contemporary equiva-
lent of the stereotypically Neanderthal 
practice of clubbing a woman and 
dragging her back to the cave. 

Strangely enough, it seems to be the 
men (sorry, guys) who prompt women 
to play games. There appears to be a 
generally masculine aversion 10 
expressing interest, or disinterest, in 
women for fear of oooh-God-forbid 
rejection or stomping on the poor girl 's 
heart and coming across as insensitive. 
At least those are my experiences. 

Instead of communicating openly 
and honestly, many men protect them-
selves by misleading women. Here is a 
perfect example of how deceptive a 
man can be and not even realize it. r 
know this cute guy who told me about 
a month ago that he broke up with hi s 
girlfriend earlier this year. He and I 
had commiserated that directness is 
the best way to broach the topic of 
interesl in another person. 

Some time pa sed and wc tlirtcd on 
and off, as occurs in most male-female 
relationships. Well, last week I ran 
unexpectedly into my friend , and he 
unleashed a whole world of nallery 
and unabashcd flirting on me. 
Although he was with hi s fricnd~, I felt 
moved to ask him out for a drink. I 
wrote a brief, yet direct notc, so as not 
to embarrass him in the company of 
his friends, and left.

C~MM~NT~RY: Human decency and random acts of kindness will help 
bnng a httle JOY to those brave people who do the jobs the rest of us won 't 

ApPRECIATE THE "LITTLE PEOPLE" 
By Dan Streeter 
Staff Writer 

It ha been said that capitali sm 
is a shit sandwich. The more bread 
you 've got, the less shit you taste . 
This pithy asscssment of our eco-
nomic sys lem seems especially 
valid when you consider what it 's 
like to work in the Cannery Row of 
the service industry - bagging 
groceries al Ralphs, working the 
lat.e-shift at Denny's or thc drive-
through at Taco Bell. 

The questions su rrounding "bad 
jobs" should not be whether they 
are enjoyable or worthwhile. It is a 
moot point that these jobs will ex ist 
as long as people need to pay bills. 
The main thing to consider is this: 
do we, as a society and as co llege 
students in particul ar, have a 
responsibility to improve the work-
ing conditions of the people stuck 
in these jobs" 

This article is not about 
Marxism or socia l equality. Nor is 
it about passing a law to force 
employers to provide beller condi -
tions for their workers. It is not 
about increasing the minimum 
wage, either. In fact it is not about 
the workers at all. 

It is about us, the people who 
benefit from the labor of low-end, 
service-industry employees. It is 
about our alii tudes toward people 
who service us. It is about our 
responsibility to think about the 
social and economic position of the 
people who clean your table at a 
restaurant or do low-skilled main-
tenance at your apartment complex . 
Most of all, this arliclc is about thc 
everyday exercise of empathy and 
human decency. 

As college students. we are no 
strangers to living on a tight 
income. How many of us have had 
to work in a boring, dead-end job to 
get some extra cash'! These jobs are 
tedious and often degrading to the 
real potential of the worker, but the 
work does need to be done. 

We cannot get rid of these jobs, 
but as patrons of restaurants, gro-
cery stores or any place that 
employs people for wages of near 
poverty-level , we can make the 
work much easier to stomach. 

The main thing to do is to think . 
That's it. Just think about what you 
are doing and who it is going to 
effect. 

For exam pic, if you are in a 
grocery store and you change your 

If customers are 
more 
compasslonat., the 
work.rs will have a 
more positive 
outlook and 
ev.rybody wins. 
The key Is to get 
over the 
misconception that 
you are doing the 
workers a favor by 
giving th.m your 
bu.ln .... The old 
line about their jobs 
being dependent on 
your business Is 
bullshlt. If you don't 
go th.re, someone 
elsa will. 
mind about buying sometbing, 
don't just put it in any damn place. 
Take the extra 30 seconds and put 
it back where you got it. The per-
son whose job it is to put back 
misplaced items docs nOl make 
nearly enough money to justify 
you being too lazy to clean up 
after yourself. 

The same goes for restaurants. 
I f your server is slow or seems a bit 
fraa.led, don ' t make it worse by 
constantly demanding a refill on 
your drink and don't take it person-
ally, either. Servers depend on your 
tips to survive financially so you 
can bet that they are doing the best 
that they can. If the server is really 
busy, don 't be pushy or demanding. 
Once again, the server docs not 
make enough to be your personal 
care-giver. 

I know that the customer pays a 
lot for food, but the server is not 

going to sec much 01' that money. 
So, relax, consider Iheir position . 
and givc them a break. 

All of these concerns go double 
for fast -food re taurants. The peo-
ple you interacl with at the drivc 
through and the cou nter do not get 
tips and arc not paid any more or 
less for being nice to you. 11' they 
mcss up your order or do not smi le 
at you, it shou Id not be such a big 
deal. 

They work hard and get next 10 
nothing so Ihal we can get our 
burgers and tacos for less than a 
buck. Considering the job these 
workers have to do, we should be 
grateful we get our food at all. So, 
for the last time, think. 

If you arc mde to the guy at the 
drive-through, he cannot find 
solace in a big paycheck. No one at 
McDonald's says, "Yeah, the cus-
tomers arc a pain, bUI my $5. 15-an-
hour makes it all worthwhile." By 
givi ng service workers a hard lime, 
you just make a bad job even 
worse. 

If customcrs arc more compas-
sionate, the workers will Il<Ive a 
more positive outlook and every-
hody wins. The kcy is to get over 
the mi sconception that you are 
doing the workers a favor by giv-
ing them your business. The old 
line about their jobs being depen-
dent on your business is bullshil. II' 
you don't go thcre, someone else 
will. 

When you go to a place like 
Burger King, you arc doing the 
CEO, president and owner a favor 
- not the cook or the cashier. The 
workers get such a small percent-
age of your money that in reality, 
they are doing you a favor not 
throwing the food in your face. 

You owe it to them to be under-
standing and cooperative. You owe 
it them to smile and be pleasant -
not the other way around. They 
owe itlo you to do their best and 99 
times out of 100, they do. 

h is not hard to do the right 
thing toward service workers . All it 
takes is a small, conscious effort. 
Take the first step by giving a sin-
cere thanks to anyone and everyone 
who is paid to do you a servicc. 
That means say "thank you" to the 
cashier, the bagger, the busboy -
the li st goes on and on. You'll feel 
good, they ' lI feel good and in the 
end, minimum wage might not 
seem so bad.

COMMENTARY: It is time that we as students rec1aim our national, religious and Hallmark 
holidays by taking time out from our rigorous study schedules to celebrate hearti Iy 

HOLIDAYS PROVIDE AN EXCUSE TO PARTY 
By Rachel Bar, 
St af( Writer 

Here I sit, on the eve of two 
midterms, with my first opportuni-
ty to share my opinions with you, 
esteemed Guardian readers. I have 
no doubt that only a few close 
fri ends will even pretend to care 
about these opinions I share so 
freely. but the only beller thing I 
have to do is study. I think we all 
know that I' m not going to do that. 

This brings me to the topic I 
have chosen to discuss. I'm not the 
first Guardian staff member to di s-
cuss my methods of avoiding 
studying the vast oceans of knowl-
edge passed on to us by our pro-
fessors, but I am the first to bring 
it to the multi-cultural level. 

I'm talking about the celebra-
tion of culture. The reason I ean' t 
study for my midterms: Cinco de 
Mayo! I, a woman born and raised 
in Southern California, couldn ' t 
ignore the importance of Mexican 
Independen" . After all , Califomia 
was once a part of Mexico. 

Obviously. a couple of exams 
can ' t compare to the scope of an 
entire nation's independence so, 
no studying tonight ! Instead, I will 
take my basic knowledge of 
Mexican culture and celebrate 
with margaritas and tortilla chips 
- emphasizing the former over 
the laller in my revelry. 

I think I may have inadvertent-
ly stumbled upon a brilliant new 
form of procrastinati on. Last 
Friday I participated in the centu-
ry-old ritual of May Day, or as it is 
known in Hawaii , "Lei Day." 
Unsure of the traditional celebra-
tion, I chose to avoid schoolwork 
through my time-honored tradition 
of shopping, dinner and drinking. 
After all , there is no beller way for 
a starving student to honor the 
importance of such a holiday. 

Th is doesn' t apply only to 
those holidays in the spring, either. 
There are many holidays to choose 
from. I'm call ing out to all stu -
dents to consu It your encyclope-
dias - don' t worry, it 's not study-

ing if it 's for a worth y cause. 
Veteran's Day is in ovember 

and Memorial Day is at the end of 
May, both crucial times to drink 
and party when students could be 
preparing for midterms and fin als. 
Those brave soldiers who have 
fought for our country would want 
to be honored with barbecues and 
bccr. They wouldn 't want over-
worked students spending any of 
their precious time in class or on 
homework . And don' t stop there. 
There's always Arhor Day and 
April Fool's Day. 

I don' t want Guardian readers 
to think that I ignore the important 
religious holidays by studying, 
either. In my quest to procrasti -
nate, I have come to embrace all 
the religions I can find. Aside fro m 
the usual holidays that we all get 
off from school, 1 have searched 
for any reason to put off home-
work. 

In Judaism, there is a tree-
planting holi day in the spring, as 
well as a harvest holiday in the 

fa ll. Without all this planting and 
reaping of fru its and vegetables we 
would starve, so obviously these 
days deserve a party. My Catholic 
fri ends tell me that almost every 
day is dedicated to a saint. So, 
with all those important people to 
honor, no one has time to study. 
Islam requires multiple prayer 
breaks throughout the day, so the 
fun can continue on an hourly 
basis. 

Don' t get confuscd, my dear 
readers, I'm not telling anyone 
what spec ific holidays to observe. 
I'm just encouraging you to cele-
brate as many as you can. This is 
a way for students worldwide to 
share their cultures while simulta-
neously avoiding anything 
remotely resembling studying. I 
want students to understand each 
other without having to under-
stand anything their professors 
say. If you share my opinion, 
come fi nd me and we can cele-
brate together - just not any-
where near the library.

DATING: 
There are always 
lessons to be learned 
Continued from ..... 4 

The nex t day, having heard 
noth ing, I began to questi on 
whether I had overstepped some 
un written and well-masked bound-
ary in our fri endShip. I was di s-
cussing the story with another 
fri end of mine, who dropped the 
bombshell on me. Apparently, thi s 
dashing young ladies'· man never 
actually broke up with his girl-
friend. He had lied to me. 

Needless to say, I called him 
that evening and mentioned to him 
that I had heard a nasty little rumor 
that he had never actually broken 
up with hi s elusive girlfriend. His 
response: "Why did you think I 
had?" Mine: "Oh, I don't know, 
because you told me you had?!'" 

While I can appreciate the utter 
hilarity of this episode, it certainly 
documents the minetields that men 
lay for women to precariously 
traipse through. And while I cer-
tai nly don' t trust this friend any-
more, I am not angry because I ..:an 
chalk it up to experien..:e, and per-
haps I wi ll be moti vated to dig a lit-
tl e deeper next time I am interested 
in a guy. 

To ..: ite another example of my 
dating foib les that points me 
toward believ ing that men for..:e 
women to play games, let mc ill us-
Irate the story of two more of my 
unsuspecting male friends. 

In a fit of freakish obsession at a 
time of extre me vu lnerabilit y, I 
unabashed ly to ld two of my friends 
of my burning desire to bring our 
respecti ve friendships to a more 
i mi mate level. Needless to say. 
Ihings didn 't work oUl with either 
(surpri se, surprise). Before rea..:h-
ing the conclusion that nei ther situ-
ation was going anywhere, though, 
several things transpired. 

One fri end failed to communi-
cate to me that he wasn' t interested . 
He told mc he was fl attered, 
remai ned very friendly and gener-
all y led me to believe something 
might happen. After asking him out 
about a dozen ti mes and bei ng 
rejected a dozen times, I simply 
asked if I should stop asking. He 
responded, " Probahl y." When I 
asked why he had n't said some-
thing sooner, he replied, "I didn ' t 
want to hurt your feelings." In fail -
ing to be direct from the get-go, he 
made the si tuation worse. I thought 
that, pe rhaps, he was shy when, 
actuall y, he was not interestcd, 
leading me to play games. Now, 
although we are still fri ends, we' re 
regrettably not as close as we were. 

The beller way to handlc.such a 
situation is the way my second 
friend handled my fervent interest. 
He simply told me that it wasn' t 
going to happen . While he was con-
cerned with not hurting my fee l-
ings, he still understood what need-
ed to be done. Things are now back 
to normal, and our fri ends hip 
remains undamaged. Direct, honest 
commu nication saved what has 
proven to be a worthwhile fri end-
ship. 

Ttl(: moral of the story, boys and 
gi rls, is that games arc not neces-
sary when dating. Honesty and 
communi cati on wi ll promote beller 
interpersonal relationships. While 
my adventu re wi ll conti nue regard-
less, it sure wou ld be nice to get 
some cooperation on this non-game 
playing campaign. Men. I chal-
lenge you to speak your mind and 
stop being so afraid of women. We 
won't bite unless you want us to.

BUDGET: 
College councils to 
receive more funds 
c.tInued frcNn ..... 1 
time from voluntary student dri -
vers. Leventhal said he hopes the 
program will be in full operation 
by next winter quarter. 

Leventhal also gave additional 
funds to a number of programs 
throughout hi s budge\. College 
councils could receive an increase 
of S2,500 each and registered stu-
dent organizations mi ght see 
increa es in funding as well. 

The budget hearing did not 
escape without some controversy. 
Representatives from Student 
Cable Works came to address the 
committee in regards to the cuts 
that their organization is slated to 

AWARD: 28 
percent of students 
binge drink 
ContInued from ..-g. 1 
this issue." 

According to Automobile Club 
Senior Research Associate Steven 
B loch, several criteria were con-
sidered in the competition. Judges 
looked at each program 's effec-
tiveness in deterring alcohol use. 
Other criteria included the number 
of violent crimes, the number of 
alcohol-related incidents and how 
well the program was publicized in 
the media. 

C.R.A.S.H. won in a fi eld con-
taining 15 other co lleges and uni-
versities. 

"It 's really great to see such an 

receive. Aaron Ripes, manager of 
Student Cable Works, told the 
committee that the potential cuts to 
the television and radio produc-
tion, which Leventhal based upon 
the ledgers the organization must 
keep, are unfair. 

Leventhal said he proposed cut-
ting SCW's budget because its 
members did not spend their full 
allocation last year. However, 
SCW members said that they need 
to purchase new equipment , such 
as tapes, as well as run their shows, 
and that Leventhal 's proposed 
funding will not be adequate. 

Additionally, members of the 
Committee for World Democracy 
took home a symbolic victory. In 
years past, CWO was its own indi-
vidual category within the budget. 
Last year, however, it became a 
lineitem - a sub-section of a cate-

excellent program here with col-
lege students working on such 
solutions," said Arline Dillman. a 
traffic safety expert for the Auto 
Club. 

According to the survey, 28 
percent of the students here at 
UCSD report ed binge drinking, 
defined as consuming fi ve or more 
drinks in one sitting. Nationally, 
38 percent of students reported 
binge drinking within the two-
week documented period. 

Nineteen percent of UCSD stu-
dents surveyed reported driving 
after drinking. Nationally, 33 per-
cent of students reported drivi ng 
under the influence. 

UCSD's numbers have 
decreased; a 1994 survey indicated 
that 35 percent of the students 
reported binge drinking and 27

gory. During Monday's night meet-
ing, CWO members asked the com-
mittee to restore their original status. 

Although the finance commit-
tee approved CWD's new location 
in the budget, Leventhal said he 
would recommend to the commit-
tee to reconsider its decision. He 
believes that CWD, despite its 
longevity on campus, belongs in 
the same category as all other stu-

"If it's a local call now, it wi ll sti ll 
be a local call ," Hernandez said. 

The proposals were met with 
mixed reactions at a recent public 
meeting held in Poway. 

Patrick Foley, a representati ve 
from the Poway mayor 's office, 
said the City of Poway supported 
the plan to split into new area codes 
and opposed overlays. 

One reason given was that those 
in a "new area code without the 
overlay could call each other by 
dialing only seven digits." Foley 
said it would be difficult for resi· 
dents and businesses to have two 
area codes in the same area. 

In a letter to the CPUC, Bruce 
Tarzy of the Green Valley Civic 
Association also opposed overlays, 
stati ng they are "di sruptive to 
neighborhoods and families." 

Susan Estrada, president of Aldea 
Communications, had a different 
view. Estrada spoke of the expense 
for small businesses to ehange all 
their literature, business cards and let· 
terheads because of a new area code. 

Ca lling herse lf "one of the 
unlucky ones who gOt to change 
area code in the last 619 area code 
split [to 760]," Estrada said she wa 
confused about whether to dial 
seven digits or 10 digits. 

"From what I've heard, in other 
areas of the country where they' ve 
implemented overlays with IO·digit 
dialing, it hasn't been a problem," 
Estrada said. ") suspect it wou Id be 
easier [for everyone Ito get used to 
leaving the entire IO·digit number 
instead of seven digits." 

According to Hernandez, over· 
lays have never been implemented 
in California. Hernandez also said 
there have been other suggestions in 
addition to the three proposed plans.

Second Star Productions' pre-
sentation of Christopher Durang's 
one-act play, "An Actor's Night-
mare," and the three IO-minute 
comedies performed in conjunc-
tion with it this past weekend 
were funny, light and easy to 
enjoy. 

"An Actor's Nightmare" is a 
dark comedy wrilten in the tradi-
tion of Baroque theater, using the 
"play within a play" technique 
Shakespeare was so fond of. 

The crux of the matter is this: 
George, played by Brad Davis, is 
thrust center stage in the midst of 
several different classic plays 
without knowing what his roles 
are, much less his lines. 

Aside from a bit of flat acting 
on the part of Davis in his ponray-
al of George, the piece was a suc-
cess overall. 

Laura Brenneman, a sopho-
more at UCSD, is a talented, fresh 
young actress. In addition, 
Dolores Cardelario stood out as a 
dynamic presence, and Robert 
Daehl Lee used his facial expres-
sions to their maximum comedic 
potential. 

The first of the three accompa· 
nying acts, "Breaking the Chain," 
is a spoof about a couple who 
recei ves a chain letter and takes it 
just a little too seriously. 

The second short play, "Off the 
Rack," is about the sentimental 
trials and tribulations a woman 
goes in an attempt to

An Intinate Evenilg With Bad Rdgion 
Seminal punk band returns to action with No Substance 

By Scott Yager 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

Punk is everywhere, and it's 
hOller than ever. On Sunday night 
at 'Canes, Bad Religion - one of 
the genre's best-known and innu-
ential bands - returned to San 
Diego after a two-year absence. 
Thi performance was part of a 
sma ll -c lub tour promoting their 
latest album, No Substance 
(Atlantic). 

It has been a long time si nce 
Bad Religion appeared in small 
venues, but their current mini -tour 
takes them to some of the nation 's 
smallest. Billed as "An Intimate 
Evening with Bad ~eligion," the 
tour stops at such venues as 
'Canes, the Roxy in Hollywood 
and BOllom of the Hill in San 
Francisco. 

Sunday ni ght Bad Religion 
showed that they sti ll have it after 
all these years. The band roared 
through a hli stering hour-and-a-
half set, debuting a few new songs 
but mai nly filling its set with early 
Bad Religion classic~ . 

The band kicked things off with 
the hard-driving "SuITer," from it~ 
1988 alhulll of the sallle name. The 
crowd went cra7Y, erupting in a 
huge mosh pit as audience mem-
bers dove onto the crowd from the 
inner railing. Bad Reli gion fol -
lowed up with "Punk Rock Song," 
from The Gray Race, and "2 1 st 
Century Digital Boy," from Against 
The Graill. 

II was ev ident that 'Canes was-
n't prepared for such a volatile 
show, as the securit y guards 
allemptedto stop the raging crowd. 
However, the guards and the 
omnipresent "No Mashing" signs 
did virtually nothing, and the hun-
dreds of exuberant fans welcomed 
Bad Religion back to town in a big 
way. 

Bad Religion were in vintage 
fonn - the powerful rhythm sec-
tion of bassist Jay Bentley and 
drummer Bobby Schayer laid down 
thunderous beats while guitarists 
Brian Baker and Greg Hetson 
blazed, and lead singer Greg Graf-
fin's unmistakable vocals carried

thc melody. The power and thick-
ness of the music was tempered by 
Bad Religion's trademark voca l 
harmunies. 

The band played vi rtually non-
stop, performing blocks of four or 
fivc songs with small breathers in 
between . To the delight of the 
crowd, Bad Reli gion ripped 
th rough a lot of their old material, 
inc luding "Along The Way." 
"American Jesus" and "No Con-
trol." 

Many of the songs, like "Hench-
man" and "Do What You Want ," 
lasted barely a minute in length, as 
the band thrashed through them 
with the same ferocity and invigo-
ration that it has always main-
tained. 

Bad Religion also used the inti -
mate forum to test-drive some of 
the songs from No Substance. 
Songs such as "Hear It," "The 
Hippy Killers" and "Shades of 
Truth" evoked shades of Bad Reli-
gion's classic material and were 
well-received by the crowd. 

The sweaty, intense, unforget-
table evening came to an end with 

"Fuek Annageddon, This is Hell ," 
one of Bad Religion 's oldest songs 
and easily the audience's favorite 
of the night, judging from the may-
hem that ensued. 

Prior to the show, lead singer 
Graffin and bassist Bentley sat 
down with the Guardian to discuss 
the new album, Bad Religion's 
upcoming plans and the state of 
society. 

Bad Religion were born in 19 0 
in the underground punk scene of 
Los Angeles, driven by an oppos i-
tion to the era of the Reagan Revo-
lution and the rise of the almighty 
corporation. The first incarnation 
of the band formed while all the 
members were in hi gh school; they 
began practicing in Graffin 's moth-
er's garage. Even at such a young 
age, Bad Religion 's advanced 
lyri cs and socially critical message 
set them ap:lrt from the rest of the 
pack. 

The past and current members 
possess impressive credential s. 
Founding memher Breit Gurewitz 
is the head of Epitaph Records, the 
best-known independent punk 
label and home to Bad Reli gion 
until four years ago. Greg Hetson 
formerly played with the Circle 
Jerks, and Brian Baker, the newest 
addition. played with Minor 
Threat. Dag Nasty and Govern· 
ment Issue. 

In 1982, the band released its 
debut album, HolV Could Hell Be 
All)' Wnrse, which eventu all y 
went out of print and became a 
co llector's item . The album was 
later featured on the '80- '85 col-
lection. 

Over the years, Bad Religion 
have released a number of albums 
- in addition to '80- '85, the band 
has released Suffer ( 1988), No Con-
trol (1989), Against The Grain 
(1990), Generator (1992), Recipe 
For Hate (1993), Stranger Than 
Fiction (1994), The Gray Race 
(1996) and the brand new No Sub-
stance. 

No Substance represents a 
return to Bad Religion's roots, a re-

The Garden C.eret: Sell Diego's Hidden Gem 

Outdoor theater revives the glamour and class characteristic of Hollywood's Golden Age

There is a certain charm about

more than just a unique find - it '5

Yeagley hegan to build an elegant. 
outdoor selling that ran the gamut 
from wedding receptiuns to gradu-
ation partie .~. 

With the money he made from 
hi s ea rli er endeavors, Yeagley 
began to add the accouterments lit -
tle by little - a full, beautiful gar-
den, trees, twinkling li ghts, a bub-
hie machine and - his latest act of' 
ingenuity - a waterfall that light s 
up. He st ill, however, did not know 
what the space would be used for. 

Then it hit him - the glam-
orous out let hi s vision had already 
built would become an outdoor the-
ater that showed film classics. 

Seven years later, this outdoor 
theater, the Garden Cabaret, is a 
summer event that has become an 
anticipated San Diego tradition. 
When one thinks about it , the idea 
is so perfectly sweet and appropri-
ate for a city that has the best 
weather in California. It' s amazing 
that someone didn 't think of it 

sooner. 
Located in Hillcrest just off of 

Goldfinch Street and Washington 
Street, the Garden Cabaret is easy 
to find. 

Incredibly, the price for the 
entire evening is the same as 
watching a mainstream film at lhe 
local AMC, only $8 (students $7). 
Limited $10 reserved seating is 
also ava ilable. For more informa-
tion, t:all 295-422 1. 

For a full night of fun , a fu ll cof-
fee and desert bar is provided 
inside the Garden C;lbaret. In addi -
tion, the Pasta Pronto Cafe is locat-
ed across the street. 

Pasta Pronto offe rs the only 
food that moviegoers arc allowed 
to bring into the Garden Cabaret 
whi le they watch the film (Try the 
mango tart for only $2.50 a slice). 
Call 296-57 15 for more informa-
tion. 
"Adam's Rib" (Today-Saturday) 

Spencer Tracy and Katharine 
Hepburn arc opposing lawyers in a 
sensational tri al. Feminine wiles 
clash with mascu line pride in thi s 
spirited battle of the sexes. 
"Adam 's Rib" is ahead of its time 
wi th it s argument for sexual equal-
ity. 
"My Man Godfrey" (May 14-16)

Before These Crowded Streets 

-••••• 
With its first studio album in 

two years, the Dave Matthews 
Band finds a welcome new direc-
tion for its work in Before These 
Crowded Streets. 

The band's first two albums, 
Under the Table lUId Dreaming 
and Crash, introduced the music 
world to the Dave Matthews 
Band's impressive range of musical 
abilities and genres. 

1be bind's style nmges from 
rock to pop to jazz and alternative, 
including provocative lyrics and 
complex rhythms. 

Before 1Jaese Crowded Streets 
takes the best of these elements and 

combines them with worldwide 
in fl uences. 

Old fans will rejoice in songs 
such as "Rapunzel" and "Stay (For 
A While)," which reflect the tech-
nically superb horns and drumming 
that they have come to expect from 
saxophonist LeRoi Moore and 
drummer Carter Beauford. Most 
intriguing for both old and new 
fans are the North African and 
Middle-Eastern melodies on 
"Don't Drink the Water" and, espe-
cially, ''The Last Stop." 

"Crush" moves the band in yet 
another direction, exposing the jazz 
roots of Moore, Beauford and vio-
linist Boyd Tinsley. 

For this album, the Dave 
Matthews band invited various 
musicians to lend their talent to the 
project. Alanis Morrisette rounds 
out both "Don't Drink the Water" 
and "Spoon" with soft background 
vocals, while guitarist Tim 
Reynolds and renowned banjo 
player Bela Fleck add to several 
songs. 

The real standout is the Kronos 
Quartet, which takes "Halloween"

JI-r ,.,. II Robert PI8nt 
Walking Into Clarksdale 

-
-••• 

If there's one thing classic-rock 
fans have learned over the years, it's 
"You can never go back." Well, that 
certainly applies here with Jimmy 
Page and Robert Plant. That's not to 
say Walking Into Clarksdale, the 
duo's first full-length collaborative 
album in 19 years, isn't good - it 
is. But keep this in mind: It has 
nothing to do with Clarksdale, 
Miss., the so-called birthplace of 
delta blues, and it's not Led Zep-
ptlin. Hey, hey, what can we do? 

Page, now 54, and Plant, 49, 
have accepted their place in-rock 
'n' roll lore, and they've decided to 
move on. A wise decision, as their 

respective ages prohibit them from 
aggressively leaving fans dazed 
and confused, as they did in days 
gone by (try telling that to The 
Rolling Stones). 

Walking Into Clarksdale offers 
much in the way of folk-rock with a 
metal tinge to it. Most of the time, the 
material is tight and grooving, but 
occasionally drags. Although Led 
Zeppelin may be gone, that doesn't 
stop Page and Plant from littering the 
album with hints of mighty Zep. 

"Upon a Golden Horse" recalls 
"Achilles Last Stand," with strings 
added. The album's first single, 
"Most High," echoes "Kashmir" for 
the zillionth time -like there wasn't 
enough of that on 1995's No QUflr-
ter, the duo's limp attempt to resur-
rect Zeppelin with yet more Northern 
African influences. This time, Plant's 
aged voice (not in a favorable way 
like wine or cheese) comes up short 
on the weak lyrics (''Who holds the 
truth,oh lord most highT). 

What worts on ~lking Into 
C14rbdale are the duo's new exper-
iments. "When the World Was 
Young" and "Blue Train" are quin-
tessential ballads with nods to

Smashing Pumpkins everywhere. 
Without Plant's frequent moanings 
of "Aaaa-aaahhh," these tracks rep-
resent the best of the album. 

Similarly, "Heart in Your Hand" 
offers lounge-like surf guitaring 
from Page. The title track is equal-
ly effective, combining rockabilly 
blues and Alex Lifeson-esque riffs. 

While Page and Plant may be 
older and slower, they haven't lost 
that edge - they still write damn 
good music. But with their days of 
glory long behind them, the two are 
instead blazing new trails on Walk-
ing Into Clarlcsdale without being 
overly arrogant about their past, 
corne good times or bad times. You 
know we've had our share.

SUFFER: 
Bad Religion go 
back to basics 
ContllHled from ..... 12 
lems and our overall human condi-
tion. 

"No Substance is kind of a 
throwback to the Suffer era, when 
we used to do albums all by our-
se lves," Graffin said. "After The 
Gray Race we said 'We've had it 
with big studios, we' ve had it with 
trying to go the more traditional 
rock-Slnr route.' It 's easy to sil back 
and judgc, and say 'Oh , those 
fuckin ' idiots, Ihey wC n! and did it 
in a big studio.' Bul until you real-
ly try it you don' t know. 

"With this album, we dec ided 
to just go back and go into our 
own comfortable surroundings to 
do it and write it on the spot. jusl

between humans and the ills of 
society. On No Substance, the band 
attacks issues with rcnewed vigor. 
"Sowing The Seeds of Utopia" 
casts a wary look at surface percep-
tion, while " In So Many Ways" 
examines the idea of a collective 
human suffering. 

"My writing style on thi s was 
definit ely more critical," Graffin 
said . "I was basically saying, 
' Enough is enough, we' ve got to 
make a statement .' It 's the end of 
the mill ennium , we ' ve been 
around for 20 years. Thi s record 
will probahly carry us into the year 
2000 . 

"In general I wanted 10 make a 
morc critical album to point out 
what is wrong with society," he 
added. "The fact Ihat we' ve heen 
around so long, this was the time to 
make an assessment of 20 years 
heing social crilics, and we have 
nothing 10 show for it. Our so~ i e t y 
has not evolved in a producti ve 
way. 

"What have we gOllen, since we 
started'!" he c,ontinued. :'We ha ve 
greater technology. We always 
love to hold our hands up in viclO-
ry because we havc the Inlernet. 
.But 80 perceot is pornography, and

"So we have the internet, which

disgustedl y. "We have far f'cwe r

far fewer happy peo ple in the

changed. 
"It's not putting pressure on the 

band to produce, to make any-
thing, be anything," Graffin 
explained when asked about the 
band's longevity. "Just doing it 
because you really like it. That 
helps." 

Bentley expanded on this idea: 
"We can look at these years as 

'Well yeah, we li ve far away from 
each other, but we care.' When we 
li ved ncar each other, we'd play 
because it was fun . 

'We don ' t have any shows, let's 
just get together and play, .. ' Bent-
ley continued . ... Let 's make a tape.

Yeah. thai sounds like fun . Let's

been." 

This year, Bad Religion will 
he<ldline the Warped Tour, the sum-
mer skateboarding/punk-rock tour-
ing festi va l. Other featured acts on 
the tour will be Rancid, NOFX, 
The Specials, The Dcftones, CIV 
and Less Th ~n Jake. 

"We were wait ing so long to be 
able to get on a tour Ihat was com-
munal in nature, <l nd Lollapalooza 
was never a(}p~opriate , '" Graffin 

Then when you return to

explained. "I never felt like there 
was any kind of a cross-section of a 
Ii festy Ie that we were part of. The 
Warped Tour always connicted 
with our own tours, and this year 
they worked out perfectly, so it was 
so ideal. 

"We have a record coming out, 
their tour was going to be going on 
eight weeks later, perfect timing," 
he added. "So we' re happy they 
asked us, because I know it's going 
to be the best event of the summer, 
without a doubt, bUll know that the 
bands that are on it are all our 
friends, we're all sorl of from the 
same pockel. It 's going to be just a 
really festi ve event." 

Clearly, Graffin has become 
one of music 's most thought -pro-
voking lyricists. In fact, unbe-
knownst to Graffin , Bad Religion 
fans have been circulating a peti -
tion to nominate him for presi-
dent. 

"(' ve been very clear about thi s 
in the .past. I'm not looking to get

one who does my job, doc~ my 
duty for the people," Graffin said. 
"So if th<;y nominated me, I'd feel 
obligated to clo it. It 'd be a big dis-
ruplion. I Ihink I 'd do a good job, 
though."

UCSD accomplished thi s feat by defealing 
Chico State University in a narrow 11 -10 vic-
tory in the semifinal game. 

An early schedule that included games 
against No. 6-ranked Colorado State Univer-
si ty, UCLA and Stanford gave UCSD a taste 
of the difficulties that lay ahead. 

"We benefited from a difficult early sched-
ule," Head Coach Albert Man said. " It helped 
us raise our level of play and come together as 
a team." 

Against Chico, UCSD found the game 
deadlocked at 7-7 at the half after a back-and-
forth battle. The team relied on a stingy 
defense anchored by goalie Sam Alquist, who 
had 10 saves in the second half. 

"In the period, we shut the door on Chico's 
offense," defenscman Mike Cummings said. 
"They would look in our eyes, and we would 
know they couldn't score." 

The game was won on a goal scored by 
Demetrius Chapin-Rienzo with jusl eight sec-

Tritons expect to be in the 
thick of things next season 
Continued from page 22 
We saw Ihat we could be reall y good. thai we 
could play rea lly well." 

"We also got so much closer as a team. It 's 
awesome to Ihink that we arc thi s close and 

onds remaining in regulation play. 
In the championship game, the Toreros of 

USD benefited from 13 UCSD penalties in 
the game. UCSD was forced to play over 
eight minutes of "man-down" lacrosse that 
was too much for the team to overcome.

MEN'S AND WOMEN'S ULnMATE: Both

UCSD ligures to make a strong statement 
next year with a young, tal enled squad that 
possesses sOllle serious potential thai could be 
realized in the very ncar fUlure . 

"A lot more of us wi ll play and practice

22 SPORTS 

By Kevin McLaulhlln 
Co-Associate Sporfs Editor 

Horses once ruled the west. Cowboys and Indians alike 
found these animals invaluable. Forget about dogs; horses 
were man's best friend and his primary source of transporta-
tion. 

Today, most UCSD students corral their rides in Ihe park-
ing lots. A dedicated group of students, however, remain 
all ached 10 horses. No, Ihi s isn' t some new rideshare program; 
Ihese students are members of the UCSD equestrian team. 

early 40 mcmbers in si7.e and all women except for one 
lucky fellow, Ihe leam senl Ihree conteslants to Port Jervi s, 
N.J. last weekend for Ihe season-ending Interco llegiate Horse 
Show A ssocialion (IHSA ) Nalional Competition . 

Flying to New Jersey wilh Ihe aid of sponsors were 
Anneli se Kannow, Laura Barraclough and Jennifer Wil son, 
along with their trainer Sandra Pake and team members Bian-
ca Bussey and Catherine Hager. 

For Ihose unfamiliar with horse shows, there arc six events, 
each geared toward different skill levels. Riders progress from 
a basic walk-trot to cantering, moderate j umping and more 
ambitious j umping as one's sk ills evo lve. 

Equestrian sports are well -estab lished on the East Coast 
and in parts of Ihe Soulh and Midwest. Though not represenl-
cd as a leam at Nationals, UCSD sent individual entries in the 
walk-trot, walk-trol -canter and open categories. 

In each category there arc 16 conteslants, IWO from each o f 
eight zones in the United States. California 's zone is divided 
in two reg ions - UCSD regularly compeles with USD, USC, 
Cal Poly Pomona and CSU Northridge in its reg ion. 

Each rider progressing 10 Nationals for individual compe-
lition must he one of the top IwO riders in thai event in their 
zone, so obviously these ladies arc on top of their game. 

Kannow, a freshman, has been a life- long competitive rider 
and has competed Ihe last few years in Nationals privately. An 
open-division rider, she entered in the prestigious Cacchione 
Cup, which is the top level of compelition, named for the 
founder of the IHSA. The prize for winning includes a saddle 
and a $2,000 scholarship to the international circuil in Europe.

10th Place 
at Regionals 
FUTURE: With no 
graduating seniors, UCSD 
looks to boast a veteran lineup 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

They say lime heals all wound s, even the 
deep ones. 

The wound s u ~ t a ined by the UCSD 
women's waler po lo lea rn 
after a 10-place finish at 
the 1998 Women's Water 
Polo Western Regi nals 
last weekend left a sting-
ing mark, but one only has 
to look ahead to next sea-
son 10 he rej uvenated. 

Despite not advancing 
to Ihe Collegiate National 

Championship Tournament , UCSD is a 
young team which expects to boast the same 
lineup agai n nex t season. 

It is not losi ng a single player 10 gradua-
ti on, as the learn had no seniors on the ros-
ter thi s season. 

" We are probably gelling two or three 
really good recruits for next year plus we 
didn ' t have any seniors," sophomore Megan 
Wallis said. "We will be adding a lot and 
losing nothing." 

The 
¢strian Ecstasy 

ucsn equestrian club sent three of its members to 
Neul.Jersey for the National Championships 

In its biggest game of the season during 
the Western Regionals, UCSD was bested 
by UC Davis due to some late fourth-quarter 
heroics by Jamie KOCIl , who put the Aggies 
up by I goal in the final I :30 of play. 

UCSD had taken the lead early in the 
game when freshman Sandra Lopez scored, 
but struggled to punch one through after 
that. The 2- 1 loss put the Trilons OUI of con-
tention for a berth in the National Tourna-
ment. 

Competing against the cream of the nation, Kannow 's 
horse was deep on one jump, meaning that she lacked the 
proper strides and spacing between jumps, which cost her 
valuable points. Running through a series of nine jumps 
between 3'3" and 3'6" high, Kannow fai led to place. 

Kannow al so compeled in the open-flal equitalion, in 
which she placed fifth in Ihe nation. 

"I'm prelly happy with it ," Kannow said. "I could have 
dune beller, but for my firsl lime, I thought it was so lid ." 

Representing UCSD in the walk-I rot -canter was Barra-
clough, who has heen riding for 13 years. Though she failed 
to earn a ribbon hy placing in Ihe top eighl , Barradough, a 
sophomore, will have plenty of olher chances. 

"Everyone Ihere was rea lly good," Barraclough sa id. "The 
compel it ion was pretty stiff. I just made one fata l mistake." 

Wi Ison entered in Ihe walk-trol and made her mark, plac-
ing sixth among the I tl compelitors. 

" We're hroadening everylhing," Wilson said. " We' re begin-
ning to be recognized within UCSD and Ihe communily anu 
now nalionally." 

" It was our most intense, heart- filled 
game of the season," Walli s said. "We 
played so hard. They scored a Irash goal in 
the last minute or so of play and that was it. 
It was such an abrupt end to everything. We 
are normally so used to going to Nationals 
and having a couple more weeks in the sea-
son. It was really sad." 

Unfortunately, UCSD ended a streak or 
13 straight years of goi ng to the National 
Tournamenl with the loss to Davis. The 
Aggics, by bealing the Tritons, advanced to 
the sevenlh-place game with UC Santa Bar-
bara. 

cour tesy of the UCSD equestrian club 
Ribbon: Freshman Annelise Kannow earned fifth-place honors in 
the open-flat equitation for this impressive ride. 

In a hea ted baltle which would dec ide the 
sevcnth and final team to go to mionals, 
UCSB pulled ofr an overtime victory. " We 
rea li 7.cd Ihal we have so much potential," 
Wallis commented. " Bits and pieces o f good 
play came together throughout the season.

1M Golf Tour: All-Campus Championships 

Rookie Bishop holds oft field 
The game of golf is mentatly demanding. Anyone 

who has ever played knows that concentration, focus 
and execution can waver at any time. Pressure can cause 
seasoned touring professionals to tum into drooling, 
shaking, nelVous wrecks. The 1M GoH Tour's season 
ending event is all about pressure. 

Unlike the PGA Tour, in our lillie Championship cre-
ating or enhancing pressure on the course is not only 
tolerated, but iI's encouraged. And, it starts early. 

Shank one on the driving range and plenty of comments 
foflow. One contender this year M his tee shot on the 

1 st hole 40 yards into a tree and never recovered. 
Jeff Bishop fi.ed up a 78 on Friday to take the first round lead by 4. Being a rookie in the 

field many felt he might succumb to the 'pressure' of the overnight lead and intense hazing on 
the putting green. No such luck. The Bio-engineering grad student was unflappable. He took 
evel)'one's best shots and just kept hitting 'em down the middle. He fell to an 82 on Saturday, 
but that was plenty to hold off defending champ Johny Garza by 6 strokes. 

Jeff also took honors in one of the CI058st-to-the-pin contests landing one just 8-feet from 
the pin on '18. Ben Malone won the tong drive contest with a biast of 283 yards and he also 
fired a nine iron over water 10 9-feet on number 12 to win that closest-to-the-pin contest.

Pumpin' 
Up With 

Jonah Nlsenson 
It's Time to Check 
Out Some Baseball 

It 's spring time, whi ch 
means the urge to head out to 
QlIalcomm Stad ium to catch a 
ballgame can he fe lt around the 
nution. 

Folks, it's time to wipe our 
Compadres Club cards and wi n 
some prizes, or at the very leaS! 
heckle the crap out of some 
opposing teams. Despite being a 
San Francisco Giants fan , I love 
to "root, root, root for the home 
team," unless that home team is 
the hated Dodgers. 

The atmosphere at old Qual-
comm is friendly; it 's a great 
place to take your family for an 
afternoon or evening of fun . You 
need not fear for your life if you 
happen not to be a San Diego 
Padre fan. This is di ssimilar to 
some stadiums around the 
league - particularly my home 
turf, the' Stick. 

Notoriol' sly a dangerous 
place for Los Angeles Dodgers 
fans to show their faces, 3Com 
fealUres biting winds thaI chill 
one to the very core. 

Fights are commonplace at 
3Com when the Dodgers arc in 
town. In fact , lance saw three 
fights break out in the course of 
half an inning while sitting in 
the bleachers in left field . Each 
time, the crowd would jump 
eagerly to its feet screaming 
something along the lines of 
"beat the -- out of that 
Dodger fan! " 

This would be followed by 
two bloodied youths - one 
wearing a black cap, the other a 
blue one - being dragged from 
the bleachers by uniformed 
cops. Toward the end of the. 
game, a battalion of riot police 
"formed behind the outfield 
fence. Needless to say, I thought 
it a good idea to leave then and 
there, but the heart of the lineup 
was due up in the bottom of the 
ninth. 

This kind of craziness, how-
ever, is unthinkable in the con-
fines of Qualcomm Stadium 
where the friendly heckling of 
players is the extent of any hos-
tility t.hat may be floating 
around the stadium. You might 
hear "Hey Eisenreich, that 's the 
biggest damn nos I ever did 
see," when the Milrli ns are in 
town, or "Hey Brewsky, how 
about a brewskyT' (it's one of 
those funny names you say just 
to get a good laugh). 

Qualcomm Stadium is a 
place to chill, to watch a good 
game, to eat a few dogs and 
check out the interactive screens 
that give you up-to-date stats 
around the league. It is the epit-
ome of baseball, where every-
one out there is enjoying them-
selves. In addition, you can 
wear a T-shirt, unlike frigid 
3Com Park.

The First Division II 
Ever 

UCSD rugby continues to blaze new trails 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 

Here's a little hi story lesson. 
The first intercollegiate sport com-
prised of UCSD students was not 
soccer. It was not volleyball. It 
wasn't even surfing. Yes, as is 
apparent by the large picture and 
headline above, it was rugby. 

Beginning in 1966, UCSD 
rugby blazed a trai l for all athletics 
at this universit y by competing 
against West Coast Division I pow-
erhouses like UC Berkeley and 
UCLA. It was an intercollegiate 
sport throughout the '60s and '70s, 
but in the '80 , it was turned into a 
sports club. 

Now in 1998 as UCSD is peer-
ing into the brave new world of 
Division II athletics, the rugby 
squad has come back onto the 
scene with a resurgence to again 
blaze the trail. 

This time rugby captured the 
first USARFU Division 11 National 
Collegiate Championship ever -
the first Division II National Cham-
pionship in UCSD history. 

Last weekend in Albany, N.Y., 
UCSD entered into the first-ever 
Division II rugby National Cham-
pionships and dominated the week-
end, defeating Western State Col-
lege of Colorado, 28-5, in the first 
round, then Central Connecticut 
University, 23-3, in the emis, and 
the Univer ity of Oregon, 29-5, in 
the final. 

The tournament organizers 
broke the country down into eight 
regions, and each region had to 

se lec t a representative. UCSD 
entered the tournament as the 
Southern California RFU Champi -
ons, and the No. 4-ranked squad. It 
began its quest for the title against 
Western State College of Colorado, 
the No. 5-ranked team. 

side, UCSD was able to wear out 
its adversaries, who really had no 
hope of keeping up. 

In the second contest, UCSD 
had a much tougher opponent in 
the boys from Connecticut, the No. 
2-ranked team in the tournament. 

Going into the 
t o urnam e nt , 
coaches Eri c 
Takauchi, Mark 
Stenson and Tim 
O' Hara knew that 
thei r lads were 
undersized, as 
most of the teams 
in Albany were 
much bigger than 
the boys from La 
Jolla. 

They also 
knew, however, 
that their team was 
easily the most fit 

·and had the most 
intense 
schedule.

"Practices were 
brutal ," junior 
Courtney Geigle 
said. "No one 
practices as hard 
as we do. We were 
even practicing 

Now In 1998, as

this time rugby 
captured the 
first ••• Division II 
National 
Championship In 
UCSD history. 

At first it looked 
like the lads were 
in trouble, but that 
would not be the 
case. 

It qui ckly 
became apparent 
that Central Con-
necti cut was the 
squad that was 
going to need a lit-
tle assistance. 

"We took it to 
them," team cap-
tain Troy Meyer 
said. "We just 
wore them down." 

UCSD wore 
them down to the 
tune of a 23-3 
beating. The victo-
ry earned the rug-
gers a berth in the 
final against the 
No. 6-ranked Uni-
versity of Oregon. 

The webbed-
with light contact until the day 
before the tournament ' fir t 

toed one from the Pacific North-
west were not a small contingent. 
They were easily one of the biggest 
teams that UCSD would have to 
face all year, and Oregon had also 
played some outstanding rugby to 
get to the final. UCSD's work was 
cut out for it. 

game." 
It showed. 
UCSD came out and sed its 

tremendous speed to its advantage, 
scoring early and often in a 28-5 
blowout. By getting the ball out-

What teams like Oregon didn ' t 
understand is that although UCSD 
is a smaller squad, it can still pack 
a huge hit. 

For all of the conditioning and 
speed UCSD uses, Takauchi and 
company also spent some signifi-
cant amount of time on the finer 
points of destroying the guy in 
front of them. Oregon di scovered 
UCSD's ability to destroy its oppo-
nents in the final match. 

UCSD was unable to come out 
and get on the board early as it had 
done previously. The game was 
scoreless at the half. 

In the second stanza, however. 
UCSD took over. As was the case 
in its other ballles, UCSD ended up 
wearing Oregon down until it could 
not longer keep up with the likes of 
Andy Wilga and Chay Chang. In 
the end, UCSD had a 29-5 victory 
and some extra luggage for the 
tlight home - a National Champi-
onship trophy. 

Obviously, UCSD saved its best 
rugby for when it counted the most. 
The lads played amazing all week-
end long. It 's not often that a 
National Championship is so thor-
oughly dominated. 

"It was the best we played all 
year," Geigle said. 

A win of this caliber definitely 
raise ome Division I questions. 

"We could easily compete at the 
Division I level," Meyer said. 

But as for now, how does the 
team feel about being Division II 
champs? 

"Pretty damn good," Meyer said.
