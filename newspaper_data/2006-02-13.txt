Fox Defends Extra Commitments, Pay

Chancellor denies 
local paper's report on 
vacation time. Fox says 
board jobs bring 
benefits to UCSD. 

By Matthew McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

In the face of public and media 
criticism, UCSD Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox contends that her seats 
on multiple corporate and nonprofit 
boards do not interfere with her job 
as head of the university. 

Fox said that while she does sit 
on more boards than many of her 
colleagues, her various board work 
brings major benefits to the univer-
sity. 

"It's crucial for a chancellor to 
make connections," Fox said. "We 
have to make bridges to the com-
munity, and that's what boards allow 
me to do." 

According to data obtained 
through the California Public Records 
Act, published in a recent report by 
the San Diego Union-Tribune, Fox 
used 21 vacation days last year to 
attend to her various board duties 
- more than the 18 days she accrues

-The numbers are wrong," she 
said. "I've never exceeded my vaca-
tion time here." 

The Union-Tribune also reported 
that Fox had spent more than 180 
hours attending board meetings last 
year alone, and many of those meet-

ings were on the East Coast. 
Fox, an organic chemist, sits on the 

corporate boards of medical device 
developer Boston Scientific, clinical 
research company Pharmaceutical 
Product Development, chemical 
manufacturer W.R. Grace and soft -
ware company Red Hat. She earns 
stock or cash for her corporate ser-
vices, she said, and she indicated that 
she had those jobs long before she 
became UCSD chancellor. 

Fox's board duties extend to the 
nonprofit sector as well. Her ser-
vices include government boards and 
private foundations, which offer no 
compensation, she said. 

She added that by virtue of being 
chancellor, she is a member of sev-
eral local boards, including the La 
Jolla Playhouse, San Diego Science 
and Technology Council and the 
Children's Hospital. 

Though Fox acknowledged that 
board meetings do take up some 
of her time, she stressed that her 
dedication lies with UCSD's inter-
ests and that when board duties and 
university business coincide, UCSD 
comes first. 

Fox said she spends 60 to 70 
hours a week on work dedicated to 
the university, and she skipped a 
board meeting last month to attend 
the UC Board of Regents meeting 
at UCSD. ' 

-I attend to iny board duties with 
vacation time only, and I always 
assign priority to university busi-
ness," Fox said. 

Fox also said that her board duties

Bush to Nation: Put on Your Thinking Cap 
By VlGdimir Kogan 
SENIOR STAfF WRITER 

American inventor Thomas 
Edison, who was known to work 20 
hours a day in his lab, once promised 
to discover "a minor invention every 
10 days and a big thing every six 
months or 50.- In announcing his new 
plan for growth in American innova-
tion. President George W. Bush has 
been equally ambitious. 

"Innovation is a vital part of the 
future of the United States of America, 
and the fundamental question is, 
how do we keep our society innovi-
live?" Bush said earlier this month 
when he unveiled his new American 
Competitiveness Initiative. "So what I 
said to the Congress was, let's be wise 
with taxpayers' money: Let's stay on 
the leading edge of technology and 
change, and let's reaffirm our com-
mitment to scientific innovation." 

Under the plan. the federal gov-
ernment would greatly expand fund-
ing for basic research in the physical 
sciences and engineering, doubling 
support over the next decade for the

and frustration over the university's 
compensation practices with its top

The 10-campus system is in the

revealed that the university had 
awarded more than S800 million in 
previously undisclosed compensation

Study Predicts 
Postwar Disorders 

Horrific war experiences may 
result in a lifetime of increased 
physical disease and mental health 
difficulties, including early death, 
for soldiers returning from battle, a 
new study conducted by UC Irvine 
researchers suggests. 

Published in the February issue 
of Archives of General Psychiatry, 
this is the first research to link objec-
tive records of war trauma and men-

tal health over the full life course of 
veterans. 

To measure the extent of each 
soldier's war trauma, researchers 
used Civil War records and looked 
at the percentage of a soldier's 
comrades killed, numbers of deaths 
or dismemberments, friends lost, 
extent of fear for imminent death 
and the killing of others. 

Researchers found that, in mili-
tary companies with a larger per-
centage of soldiers killed, the veter-
ans were 51 percent more likely to 
develop a cardiac, gastrointestinal 

or nervous disease and 93 percent 
more likely to develop signs of 
a combined physical and nervous 
disease 

lJC Applications 
Reach Record High 

A record total of 106,784 stu-
dents applied to at least one UC 
campus for fall 2006, a 6 .6-per-
cent increase from the year before, 
according to new data released by 
the university. 

Prospective freshmen filed nearly 
83,000 applications. In-state fresh-
man applications grew by 7.7 per-
cent, out-of-state freshman appli-
cations grew by 14.9 percent and 
international freshman applications 
grew by 16.9 percent. 

Transfer numbers posted mixed 
results, with in-state and interna-
tional transfer applications falling 
by 0.4 percent and 2.2 percent, 
respectively. 

Out-of-state transfer applica-
tions, however, showed a 10.7-per-
cent increase.

Chancellor Would Have Rethought Job Without Extra Pay Perk 
~ FOX, from page 1 
help enhance her performance as 
chancellor because of the connec-
tions she makes. She gave the exam-
ple of a "55 million donor" to the 
university that she met through one 
of her boards. She meets many other 
people with interest in UCSD on her 
trips, which are fmanced by the com-
panies, allowing her to make univer-
sity contacts without using university 
time or money. 

In a letter Fox sent to UCSD 
faculty, which has been obtained 
by the Guardian, she indicated that 
she believes her board duties have 
improved her overall leadership 
capabilities. 

"My board service ... [has] given 
me unique perspectives about the 
challenges of the business world and 
the issues that wiu face the future 
employers of our students," Fox stat-
ed in the letter. "And, it 's experience 
that I have gained over the many 
years that I have worked with these 

organizations, giving me expertise 
that I have found invaluable." 

Fox also defended the 5248,000 
sabbatical stipend she received when 
she was hired as UCSD's chancellor. 

Jean-Bernard Minster, a geophys-
ics professor at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography and the chairman of 
UCSD's Academic Senate, said last 
month that he has no problem with 
Fox's salary and that she has gained 
the "respect and trust of the majority 
of people he talks to:' 

"She earned that sabbatical," 
Minster said. "She deserves to be 
compensated." 

Fox said she accrued the sab-
batical during her time as chancellor 
of North "Carolina State University, 
and UC President Robert C. Dynes 
offered her the sabbatical stipend as 
part of her hiring package because 
she would lose the money by leaving 
North Carolina. 

"[Dynes] offered to 'make me 
whole;" she said. "He offered me a

Fox indicated that if she had not 
been offered the stipend as part of 
her hiring bonus, she would have had 
to think very seriously about accept-
ing the position as UCSD chancellor. 

"I would have had to speculate 
with my own mind," she said. "But 
the reality is that I was offered the 
money." 

But Maria Figueroa, the UCSD 
representative of the Coalition of 
University Employees, suggested that 
such large compensation packages 
are unfair. 

"There are clerical employees 
who work one or two extra jobs to 
make ends meet;' Figueroa stated 
in an e-mail. "Health care premiums 
and parking rates have increased. It's 
obscene that the chancellor should 
be paid so much when students and 
staff struggle to get by."

that the compensation package was 
a factor in her decision to come to 
UCSD, which she said was in dire 
need of leadership. 

According to Fox, her dedica-
tion to UCSD has been demonstrated 
through her accomplishments, which 
include raising nearly S2SO million 
for the campus. Under her com-
mand, ucsb has gained new minors, 
the CaI-(IT)2 building has become

for transfer students was approved . 
She also has worked to establish 
exchange programs with universities 
in Baja California and Chin~.

Critics Argue Bush Just 
Rehashing Old Programs 
~ INmAnVE, from page 1 
to Bush's plan. "While we look forward 
to seeing the details in his budget 
. . . the investment he is proposing in 
basic, university·based research can 
hdp maintain this nation's global Iead-
ership in science and techno1ogy and 
produce the next generation of scien-
tists and engineers:' 

rn large part, the initiative repre-
sents the government's reaction to pro-
gressively gloomier reports warning of 
the country's impending decline as a 
world leader in creativity and innova-
tion. As developing nations like China 
and India, along with the European 
Union, ramp up their research-and-
development spending, America has 
seen its leadership role slowly slip. In 
recent years, the nation's share of new 
patents has declined. as has the pro-
portion of scholarly articles written by 
American academics. 

Last year's report from a com-
mittee of the distinguished National 
Academies of Sciences, titled "Rising 
Above the Gathering Storm," attract-
ed the most attention. 

"Having reviewed trends in the 
United States and abroad, the com-
mittee is deeply concerned that the 
scientific and technological building 
blocks critical to our economic lead-
ership are eroding at a time when 
many other nations are gathering 
strength," the report warned. 

However, skeptics of the presi-
dent's plan have quickly pointed out 
that much of it simply repackages 
many of Bush's previous proposals 
under a different name. For exam-
ple, much of the proposed funding 
increases would go to pay for research 
in the areas of energy and national 
security, while the president's com-
mitment to increase qualified math 
and science teachers has been part 
of many earlier initiatives, including 
the No Child Left Behind Act. And 
the competitiveness initiative calls on 
Congress to make permanent the 
nation's research and experimenta-
tion federal tax credit, another one of 
the president's pet projects.

dedicated [to] knowing things." 

The day after Sobel's death, Sixth 
College Dean of Student Affairs 
James Stascavage held a forum near 
the college's residence halls during 
which students and faculty could 
discuss their memories of Sobel and 
the importance of psychological 
hea.lth. 

____ ":If we see somebody in distress, 
we have free psychological sup-
port available 24/7," Sixth College 
Provost Gabriele Weinhausen said. 
"It may be that many of us don't 
know that. We need to be listening 
and sensitive and really watch out 
for each other." 

Sobel, who studied biology, was 
largely introverted around those 
who didn't know him well, accord-
ing to Sixth College freshman Nara 
Yoon, who lived in Sobel's build-
ing. 

"He was pretty quiet, but was 
such a nice guy," she said. "It would 
usually be me who said hi to him 
first. He was really dedicated to 
studying, and was in his room a lot 
studying." 

The apparent suicide came as 
a surprise to King, who said Sobel 
seemed fine when the two last 
spoke. Sobel's death highlights the 
importance of suicide prevention 
through student use of the campus' 
psychological services, administra-
tors said. 

Sobel's apparent suicide would 
be the first on campus this academic 
year. In 2004-05, there was one on-
campus suicide, according to police 
records.

Rock the Vote 
Needs a Little 
Less Rock, a 
Little More 

I generally have a hard time feeling sorry for music execu-tIves. 
Even though their nonprofit 

baby Rock the Vote is $700,000 
in debt, I still don't feel sorry for 
them. They had it coming. 

In 1990, when Rock the Vote 
founder Jeff Ayeroff created the 
organization to encourage youth 
voting with the help of the music 
industry's visibility, his intentions 
were about as pure as Paris Hilton. 
In actuality, Ayeroff was more con-
cerned with deluding the youth 
into listening to music of artists he 
was trying to promote rather than 

increasing political awareness. For 
the record, Ayeroff is also the co-
chief of Virgin Records, although 
not such a vi rgin when it comes to 
promoting the special interests of 
the music industry. 

But Ayeroff is not enhrely to 
blame fo r the organization's misdi-
rected priorities, since other music 
executives from Sony BMG Music 
Entertainment and Warner Music 
Group make up a number of the 
board members who manage the 
nonprofit. Gather that many profit-
thirsty people in a room together 
and they're bound to lose sight of 
t he organization's ideals at some 
poi nt. So before Justin Timberlake 
cries them a river over the sorry 
state of their artist-promoting polit-
ical machine, and we all get duped 
aga in , let us pause to look around 
a bit. 

I! seemed like a nice idea when 
artists like Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, 
Good Charlotte, Alanis Morisette, 
Joss Stone, Robbie Williams, the Foo 
Fighters, Korn and many more used 
their celebrity status to get young 
voters between the ages of IS and 
24 to head to the polls and cast their 
votes. Unfortunately, Rock the Vote 
compromised many of its goals as a 
nonprofit to aid record executives 
tryi ng to give certain artists more 
pUblicity. 

Frighteningly, former president 
of the organization, Jehmu Greene, 
even admits this. 

"Board members wanted to," said 
Greene in a February Los Angeles 
Tim es article. "But sometimes it was 
way too expensive, or would send 
the wrong message, like -having a 
rock band play when we're trying to 
register kids into hip-hop." 

Registering the wrong voters, 
however, was just one of several 
drawbacks of the organization's ties 
to the music industry. The article 
specifically mentioned Ayeroff 's 
request for Rock the Vote to share in 
paying the cost of flying Green Day 
back to its Asian tour, in exchange 
for the group's performance at a 
Rock the Vote event. While in this 
case Rock the Vote refused to pay 
the $120,000, deals like this, which 
frequently occur in the music indus-
try, shed light on Rock the Vote's 
less-recognized purpose. 

"It's normal to have tension 
between entertainl1,lent goals and 
politlcal effectiveness," Ayeroff said.

By Megan Durluim 
STAFF WRITER 

I t's no secret that public schools could use more money. More money means more teachers and smaller class sizes, better pro-
grams and higher-quality education materials. 
So it's not surprising that schools are looking 
into the funding incentives under the No Child 
Left Behind Act, including a part that gives more 
money to schools with higher average daily atten -
dance. But how does a district convince students 
to come to school? 

Well, how about paying them? 
The practice is actually more common than 

some might think. The New York Times reports 
that such programs have been recently imple-
mented at schools of all levels in Massachusetts, 
Kentucky, Illinois, Texas, Georgia and even here 
in California. These programs offer everything 
from money, iPods, vacations, groceries, mortgage 
payments and even cars as incentives to attend 
classes. Of course, funding isn't the only motive 
for these schools. As education officials argued 
in the Christian Science Monitor, schools can't 
function if students don't go to class. But, while it 
follows that better attendance mean.s students will 
do better in their classes and learn more, district 
money could be better used elsewhere. 

First of all, there is no reason to reward chil-
dren for something they should be doing anyway. 
By law, students have to attend school until they 
are 16. If we are going to reward them for follow-
ing the law, why shouldn't we hand out $5 bills to 
drivers following the speed limit, or give money 
to underage students who aren't drinking on a 
Friday night? Such a program sends the message 
that school is optional, and that coming to school 
is unusual and virtuous enough to deserve a 
reward. Many officials agree that it seems unethi-
cal to pay students to go to school, and that it 
could be setting a dangerous precedent. 

"It's against our grain to suggest that you 
have to cajole, seduce or trick students in order 
to get them to learn," said Jeff Bostic, director of 
the school psychiatry at Massachusetts General 
Hospital to the New York Tunes. "And where does 
it end? Art we going to need to give out a Porsche 
Boxster?" 

There's also little evidence that such programs 
actually increase attendance. In fact, at Chelsea 
High School in Massachusetts, attendance rates 
actually went down after the school implemented 
an incentive policy. Chelsea offered $25 a quarter 
for students with perfect attendance but in doing 
so they also softened the punishment for students 
who didn't show up to class. Students were no longer

the monetary 
incentives were not 
enough to entice students into the classroom. In 
a Chicago district that also offered incentives, 
district spokesman Joi Meeks said in the New York 
Times that attendance hadn't changed in the year 
since it implemented the prizes, although it was 
"too soon to evaluate the program." 

Not only is there little evidence that they 
work, there have also been occasions where 
programs like these have backfired. Besides the

ing a health risk to themselves and others, in 
low-income neighborhoods the monetary incen-
tives themselves can cause problems. Michael 
Grady, a professor of educational studies at St. 
Louis University, is a consultant for a charter 
school in Missouri compoted of students kicked 
out of other school •. It gave students a $50 cbeck 
for- every week that they had perfect atten-
dance. Student attendance rose, but there were 
increased instances of students buying drugs 
an4 so~e kids were even beaten by parents, who 
were dependent on the cash, for missing a day 
of school. 
• Also, especially in the elementary schools 
that are implementing the program, sometimes 
attendance depends more on parents than on 
the actual child. Richard Ryan, a professor of 

Some students need to occasionally 
• care for their siblings or work to suppon 
their families. A car could break down or there 
could be a death in the family and, at least at 
Chelsea, these would be considered absences. 
Once a student misses one day; his perfect record 
is ruined and the incentive no longer applies. 
Why not miss more days of school? 

And even if students are coming to class more 
often because of the incentives, that's not neces-
sarily a good thing. Attendance by itself isn't a 
guarantee of better academics. The incentives 
don't do anything to improve the classroom expe-
rience, especially if the students are only at school 
because they want to earn money or prizes. 

In fact, having more students come to class 
only helps to swell already large classrooms, plac-
ing more pressure on the teachers who are already 
overworked and underpaid. The California 
Educator reports that California is facing a huge 
shortage of teachers, with as many as 300,000 
needed over the next decade. It doesn't help that 
one in five teachers leaves the profession ~thin 
the first three years on the job and that, to fill 
the gap, the state has been hiring many more 
uncredentialed instructors. Part of the problem is 
that the average salary for teachers in California, 
a state with extremely high costs of living, is only 
$45,400 a year, which is on average $7,894 less 
than that of other college graduates of the same 
age and education level. 

So perhaps, instead of spending their mont!)' 
on attendance incentives, school districts should 
try to improve their standards of academics by 
starting with the classroom. A better, more excit-
ing curriculum would make kids want to oome 
to school, especially if they felt that their classes 
were actually relcvant to their lives. Paying teach-
ers higher salaries would also be a good idea. 
Any of these actions would lead to a better 
classroom experience and perhaps to better test 
KOres, another way of earning funding under the 
NCLBA. 

Perhaps it's just that the program smacks of 
bribery and raises ethical questions. Or maybe 
it's the fact that it seems like the money could be 
put to use in other areas, such as teacher salaries, 
rather than in an unproven and possibly coun-
terproductive incentive program. But paying stu-
dents money to come to school in order to raise 
more money seems to be about as harebrained an 
idea as they come.

Keep in mind that both Sony 
BMG and Warner Music, companies

"alternative" methods to promote 
their artists. Just last June, Sony 
BMG agreed to pay a hefty 510 mil -

the company practiced "pay-for-
play," giving illegal bribes to radio 
stations like the local Channel 93.3 
in exchange for it playing certain 
artists. Warner Music paid $5 mil -
lion for its "pay-for-play" practices. 

Ignorance of Rock the Vote's 
muddled priorities, however, merely 
represents a greater apathy in the

to be too concerned with immediate

Poor Student: 1 had just gotten

My friends from work were driving 
me to where my car was parked. We 
drove along the slreet where it had 
been and it just, like, wasn't there! 
I, like, didn't believe it at first - I 
got out of their car thinking I had 
missed it and walked back up the 
street. My friends circled around 
and didn't see it either. There were 
no clues - the fucking ·thing just 
wasn't there.

the V1N (I made sure to say it extra 
snotty) is: three- V-C-N- two-" 
And she was like, "five- Z- T- 9- U?" 
And I just yelled "No" disgust-

"five- Z-T?" And I just kept getting, 
like, more and more pissed and she 
kept getting it wrong, kept saying 
the same wrong fucking letters and 
numbers back again. So FINALLY, 
after I had been shouting like a mad 
man into my phone while stand-
ing in an empty, foggy parking lot 
from like 12:30 to 1:30 a.m., she got 
the number right. While my throat 
rested, I heard fevered typing in the 
background, and finally, with all the 
disinterested clinicality she could 
muster through our staticky connec-
tion, she dropped the bomb: 

· Sir, your vehicle wasn't stolen. 
My records show that your vehicle 
was impounded earlier tonight."

cleared out of my ears and my eye-
brows had, like, returned 10 their 
normal nonacute angle, she seemed 
to be telling me how to pay back 
parking tickets, or something.

on you, eh? Claiming you d idn't 
have a right to park your machine 
on a public street? 

PS: Yeah! I mean, I just like, 
honestly forgot to pay them! I didn't 
mean to. OK - well , 1 kind of 
thought you could just not pay them 
for a while, and it would never really

didn't even deserve, like, hal - I 
mean, I didn't deserve any.

. UC Audit Into Pay Will Finish This Month 
~ HEARINGS, from page 1 
told the Senate Higher Education 
Committee. vWe have not always met 
the expectations we have in ourselves 
as stewards of a great public institu-
tion:' 

At its January meeting. the UC 
Board of Regents tpproved an exter-
nal investigation, conducted by a pri-
vate company, into the system's pay 
policies. The three-part audit, which 
will explore compensation payments 
to 3.2 top university executives over 
the past 10 years, is expected to con-
clude this month. 

After the audit. the state would 
see a "fairly major overhaul" of the 
university's compensation practices, 
Regent Judith Hopkinson said at the 
meeting. 

But as of now: some legislators 
remain unconvinced of the universi-
ty's commitment to fixing problems 
with transparency, and are calling for 

more accountability. 
VI want to know whether heads 

might roll," state Sen. Gloria Romero 
(D-Los Angeles) said at the hearing. 
"( want us to go beyond mea culpas 
and exact some responsibilitY-' 

Other lawmakers have called for 
more drastic action, including strip- . 
ping the university of its constitu-
tional autonomy. While the university 
is mostly independent, it still relies on 
billions in state funding every year. A 
bill to take away the system's autono-
my is still a viable option, according 
to state Sen. Jeff Denham (R-Merced), 
who authored the measure. 

"We've got to rein in this corrup-
tion:' he said. "With this option, we 
could directly cut salaries for execu-
tives." 

Legislators, along with work-
ers' unions and student advocacy 
groups, have been particularly miffed 
by the university's annual proposals 

to increase executive salaries while 
simultaneously increasing student 
fees and keeping other workers' wages 
Rat. This year, regents proposed an 
8-percent fee hike for students, which 
may eventually be eliminated by a 
S7S-million buyout proposal by Gov. 
Arnold Schwanenegger. 

"There's been a proposal every 
year to increase tuition and rank-and-
file workers have faced salary freezes," 
Denham said "Dynes said he had 
a salary freeze as well, but I'm frus-
trated by his answers and I'm looking 
further into it." 

The hearings are part of the state 
Legislature's own audit into the uni-
versity's pay practices. The higher 
education subcommittee will hold 
another hearing on Feb. 22, when 
regents will address the senators.

Perkins Loans Targeted for Elimination

have branded the plan as a sym-
bol of the administration's skewed 
priorities. 

"The president has been hypo-
critical in his stante on education; 
United States Student Association 
Legislative Director Jasmine Harris 
said. "He states a concern for eco-
nomic competitiveness in his State 
of the Union ada tess, then puts 
these college programs on the back 
burner. It's worrisome, considering 
where our country's investment 
should be in education." 

Bush administration officials, 
however, contend that the cuts in 
the budget were necessary to pro-
vide money to more important 
programs. 

*Federal dollars must be spent 
wisely or not at all," the White 
House stated in a press release. 

"Funding ... must be redirected 
toward programs that either have 
been proven to work or hold 
promise of achieving the adminis-
tration's goals most effectively." 

The budget calls for money 
to fund specific new programs in 
education. 

The president's Academic 
Competitiveness Grants program, 
a largely merit-based system that 
provides aid to low-income stu-
dents, for example, received an 
$850 million allocation in the 
budget, a S60 million jump from 
the funding originally approved 
by Congress in its budget recon -
ciliation. 

In addition, the budget propos-
es $24 million for college collabo-
rations with schools to enhance 
students' education in certain for-
eign languages, such as Farsi and 

Arabic. 
The funding is part of Bush's 

National Security Language 
Initiative, which aims to improve 
national security and foreign rela-
tions by bolstering education in 
languages deemed critical to over-
seas efforts. 

College lobbyists see the over-
all picture for students as grim, 
despite the new programs in the 
budget. 

*The president is calling for 
a net cut in need-based student 
financial aid," Becky Timmons, 
director of government relations 
for the American Council on 
Education. told the Chronicle of 
Higher Education . "There's just no 
way to sugarcoat it."

Social Sciences Server 
Crashes After Hack 
By Agwtina Ugdst~ 
CONTRIBUTING WRI TER 

For the third time in less than 
two years, hackers breached UCSO's 
computer systems, this time holding 
up a number of online services in 
the social sciences division, including 
Web mail servers, as students pre-
pared for midterm exams. 

Students and professors found 
themselves unable to access class Web 
sites after the division shut down 
some online services because of a 
hacking into the system. No personal 
information was 

to outside accounts were blocked from 
using the system during the shutdown, 
but anyone who used the UCSD Web 
mail service should have received mes-
sages as usual, said Bunnie Jacquay, the 
administrative manager of the social 
science computing facility. 

Nevertheless, both students and 
faculty members missed appoint-
ments and some meetings did not 
take place because of miscommu· 
nication, communications professor 
Michael Cole said. Faculty had to 
deal with an overload of students 
at office hours requtsting responses 

to questions 
accessed, pro-
grammer analyst 
Thanh Nguyen 
said. 

Records show 
that the hacker 
had access only 
to services a regu-
lar Web site user 
would see and 
was limited in 
the darnafIe he or 
she could have

Administrative Manager, Social 

Science Computing Facility 

The hacker triggered red flags by 
sending a large number of r~quests 
from a Web account to contact other 
servers, which changed patterns in 
incoming and outgoing requests. This 
alerted the social sciences com put -
ing facility that something was not 
running smoothly, which led to the 
temporary shutdown of the system by 
the department. 

The incident was less serious than 
a fall 2004 haclting in which students' 
Social Security numbers and bank 
account information were exposed. 
Because the social science division 
does not keep private information, the 
hacker did not have access to that kind 
of data, Nguyen said. People who had 
opted to forward their campus e-mail 

knowledge and 
the use of simpler - and now less 
frequent - communication methods. 

Measures are being taken to 
improve the security system and the 
safety of users, Nguyen said. The divi-
sion is working with campus security

"We are increasing our avenues so

N o day makes a single person feel less fabulous than Valentine's Day. It seems that the entire month of February is dedicated to couples 
from commercials focu sed on finding 

the perfect gift for your significant other 
to restaurant specials advertising romantic 
ambiance. 

Single "Sex and the City" fans who associate 
the phrase "single and fabulous" with Carrie 
Bradshaw's punctuation error on a magazine 
cover tend to associate a question mark with 
their own fabulousness as weU. But this year 
there is not going to be a question mark at the 
end of ·single and fabulous;' only a very large 
exclamation point! . 

Although, traditionally, Feb. 14 is a single 
person's least favorite day of year, there is no 
reason your single status should prevent you 
from celebrating. 

What better than to proclaim your single 
and fabulous status than by gathering some of 
your equally fabulous single friends together 
for a party?

to the desires of the heart. Love 
has inspired plays, poetry and art. 
The Romans tailored mythology 
to accommodate love, portraying 
Cupid as the tiny-winged child of 
Venus - the Roman goddess oflove 
- who shot people with arrows and 
infected them with love. 

thousands of years 
love was part chance, 

circumstance, and mostly 
scientists are now busy

sexual chemistry, romantic 

and long-term attraction, 
also what chemicals cause the 

feelings of romantic excitement and 
contentment.

perfect mate? Are they the man 
or woman of your dreams? Or

complement and to provide their 
child with a strong immune system. 
And pheromones may help you to 
"sniff" out the right person. These 
chemical scents released by the 
body act as a billboard, broadcasting 
essential information about what 
you have to offer others. 

Wben you find a person that 
makes your beart race and your 
cheeks flush, you're said to be in the 
infatuation or attraction phase of 
love. This is when you can stay up 
all night talking on the phone, or 
spend days holed up in a hotel room 
making love. 

You've been hit with Cupid's 
arrow, the one tipped with 
phenylethylamine (PEA). PEA 
really is known as the -love drug; 

because it controls the flow of

Couples Beware, Single Life Is In Fun Swing 
• SINGLE, from page 10 

Ever heard that one person's trash 
is another's treasure? The saying can 
be extended beyond material objects 
to become a central theme of your 
Valentine's Day recycle party. Each 
guest is required to bring a "date" 
of the opposite sex, who could be a 
catch for someone else. The caveat 
is that everyone in attendance needs 
to be aware of the party theme 
so as to avoid any awkward and 
uncomfortable moments. 

As party guests mingle, love 
sparks will begin to fly. Hopefully 
before the night is over, you and 
your guests will be cuddling with 
newly discovered treasures. 

For the 21 and up crowd, 
Valentine's Day is a great time to

and go out for a night on the town in 
the Gaslamp Quarter. 

To mingle with San Diego's most 
beautiful people, try Beach at the

bars and clubs will be catering 
to single people with great drink 
specials. For a more casual partying 
experience, check out Pacific Beach,

be ready for some excitement from 
Pacific Beach Bar and Grill and 
Longboard's. 

How about making some money 

for being single? Single guys, this 
is a perfect activity if you do not 
want to spend the night alone. Grab 
your buddies, beer, junk food , poker

a poker night. At least one person is 
guaranteed to get luclcy. 

Or why not take advantage of the 
Tuesday holiday and go on a midweek

What Mariah, the Cure and 
Fitty Can Do For Your Love Life 

By Karie Westfall 
STAFF WRITER 

Music has always been a form of expres-
sion. But does it express the sentiments of 
love - or can it define how we think and feel 
about love? 

From sentimental love songs like the Cure's 
"Lovesong" to songs about breakups like Ne-
Yo's "So Sick:' and others about just plain 
sex like Jamie Foxx's "Unpredictable," popular 
music deals heavily with the heterosexual guy-
girl dynamic. 

The content of popular music is diverse, 
but with mainstream hip-hop and its typical 
fare of "pimps and hoes" topping the charts, 
one begins to wonder if we actually use this 
language in dealing with each other. 

It has been suggested that popular music 
can define our dialogue about relationships 
and everything that comes with them. David 
Honon conducted a study in the late 1950s on 
why adolescents use language from popular 
songs in courtship. He argues that teenagers 
borrow dialogue from music to express and 
shape their undeveloped feelings in romance 
and dating rituals. 

We've come a long way since the 1950s • 
but do we still use popular music to express 
ourselves in our relationships? 

Sociologists like ex-rock critic Simon Frith 
argue that songs do not replace our conversa-
tions. Rather, songwriters or musicians can 
make us feel like our emotions are richer or 
more convincing, he claims in "Towards an 
Aesthetic of Popular Music." For example, 
hearing a song like Mariah Carey's "We Belong 
Thgether" may dramatize emotions after a 
breakup. 

While popular music has an effect on the 
individual, it is also the individual's tastes that 
shape popular culture. 

As Frith says, "Pop tastes do not just derive 
from our socially constructed identities, they 
also help to shape them." This is to say that 
popular music reflects our relationships, but 
it is also created and made "popular" by our 
relationships. 

So, if our relationships are both reflected in 

BEN DECAMP/CU"'RDI"'N 

and help to shape popular music, do we hold 
the same values that popular songs portray? 
Are songs like "Laffy Taffy" really what we are 
all about? 

At places like Pacific Beach Bar and Grill 
on a Friday night. one might say there is an 
element of truth in the ways popular music, 
panicularly mainstream hip-hop, portrays the 
interaction of men and women. The bar sce-
nario, of men and women with the "holla at ya 
girl" mentality in an atmosphere of alcohol and . 
lust, is a part of the male-female interaction, as 
shown by songs such as "There it Go,' more 
commonly known as that "whistle" song. 

The connection between relationships and 
music is not so direct, though. The music 
of mainstream popular culture is the output 
of a large equation of marketers, publicists, 
songwriters, media conglomerates and talent 
agents.

President Says Measure on Par With '60s Efforts There's more to a serenade 
than a set of snappy lyrics ~ BUSH, from page 3 Out ide of the three agencies tar-geted for funding boosts, in fact, mo t 

of the government's research organs 
wiU still likely see their budgets stay 
flat or even fall over the next sev-
eral years. Under the president's 2007 
budget proposal, unveiled last week, 
funding for the National Institutes 
of Health - the primary source of . 
money for biological research -
would stay Ilat, after dedining in 2006 
for the first time in 36 years. 

Between 1998 and 2003, een as 
the recent golden age for American 
R&D spending, the NIH saw its bud-
get double - a period of time half the 
length of the president's proposal. 

In fact, aside from increases to pay 
for space vehicles, weapons and new 
energy sources, spending on research 

Valentine's 
"Sweet Treat" 
Film Special 

Sunshine Store 

would actually fall next year for the 
first time since 1966, according to an 
analysis prepared by Kei Koizumi, 
directo r of the R&D Budget and Policy 
Program at the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science. 

In his announcement, Bush co m-
pared the initiative to efforts of the 
federal government in the 1960s to 
leap ahead of the Soviet Union, after 
the successful launch of Sputnik, the 
world's first manmade sateUite. 

"[Thosel measures, fo r the 
most part, failec; stated Andrew J. 
Coulson, director of the Center for 
Educational Freedom at the libertar-
ian Cato I nstitute, in a press release 
comparing Bush's focus math and sci-
ence education to the previous efforts. 
"Normally, when history repeats itself, 
it is supposed to be fust as tragedy

and then as farce. President Bush has 
managed both at once, by believing 
- against all evidence - that the best 
way to improve education is through 
central planning." 

At his peak, Edison carne d ose 
to meeting his promise, averaging 
a patent every I I days and invent-
ing "big things" like the phonograph 
and the marnent for the incandescent 
light bulb. Bush, though, will likely 
have a harder time: His 10-year plan 
would require support fro m the next 
two presidential administrations and 
from Congress, which has a history 
of loading appropriation bills for the 
government's research bodies with 
special earmarks and pork projects.

~ MUSIC, from page 15 
Also, the va lue of songs does not 

just lie in lyr iCS. Frith argues that it 
is not necessarily the lyr ics that we 
respond to in a song, but rather the 
voice that we identify with. 

So we m ay like a song not because 
the lyrics are part icularly appealing, 
but beca use we ident ify with the 
sound: the voice, the beat or the 
rhythm. 

So while some people, espe-
cia lly women, would be thoroughly 
offended if they focused on the lyr-
ics of songs such as Em inem and 
Nate Dogg's "Shake T h at," they 
might still r un to the dance Iloor 

at the clubs proclaiming, "Oh yeah , 
this is my jam." 

O ther fac tors such as nostalgia 
relate to why we may be attracted 
to certain songs. Songs that remind 
us of a certain time or place come 
to hold special value for us, even if 
the song's lyrics do not reflect o ur 
own values. 

In this regard, songs playa spe-· 
cial role in relationsh ips. A song that 
becomes "our song" in a relationsh ip 
m ay be special in that it rep resents 
feelings wrapped up in time and 
places, but not necessar ily for the 
specific values the song represents 
itself.

UCSD Falls to No.9 CSLBU in Invitational 
• HOSTS, from page 20 
period. 

Unfortunately. the Tritons were 
unable to retain the lead for long. 
UCSD allowed three goals to close 
out the third and one more early 
in the fourth, leaving the Tritons 
trailing 8-5. But the Tritons fought 
back, scoring three more goals 
before the cIock ran out. However, 
UCSD could not pull within one 
possession. and the 4gers won the 
heartbreaker, 10-8. 

The Tritons are now 3-4 overall 
as they forge ahead into a prom-
ising season. Head coach Larry 

Sanders returns 14 letter-winners 
to the Tritons from a team that 
went 18-17 in 2005 and earned a 
third-place finish at the women's 
Western Water Polo Association 
Tournament. 

This season, the Tritons will 
play against the toughest teams in 
the country, including nontour-
nament matches versus the top 
three teams in the preseason top-
20: No. I UCLA, No.2 University 
of Southern California and No. 3 
Stanfor'd. UCSD will also host the 
WWPA Tournament from May 12 
through May 14, with the winner 

receiving an automatic bid to the 
NCAA Championships. 

The Tritons returned to tour-
nament play at Canyonview Pool 
on Feb. 12 on the final day of 
competition in the 14-team Triton 
Invitational. In their last two 
matches, the Tritons topped No. 
13 Indiana University in the morn-
ing and added another upset over 
No. 12 UC Irvine in the afternoon. 
Details of the games were unavail-
able at press time. Following the 
tournament, UCSD will travel to 
Bakersfield on Feb. 18 for the Cal 
State Bakersfield Tournament. 

Tritons to Host No.2 Brigham Young 
• UPSET, (rom page 20 
consistent hitting by Cal Baptist's 
junior opposite Shamsu Awudu and 
sophomore outside hitter Corey 
Spence was the difference for the 
Lancers in game one, as the Tritons 
lost 26-30. 

Serving struggles continued in 
game two with UCSD's seven ser-
vice errors to Cal Baptist's five. The 
Triton offense could not put any 
runs together, falling 20-30. 

·We didn't serve or pass at a 
high enough level to stay in the 
game; head coach Kevin Ring said. 
"There were a lot of missed oppor-
tunities to score the ball. We need 
to get into a side-out rhythm." 

Game three was the Tritons' best 
chance, with the teams remaining 
tied as late as 20 points apiece. But 
senior outside hitter Seidu Ajanako 
had two-straight kills to kick off an 
8-2 run for the Lancers. Ajanako 
ended the match with a huge kill as 
the Lancers won gam e three24-30, 
and the match 3-0. 

·We've put in some pretty good 
spurts in each game, but there's 
always a stretch where we make 

errors and give up runs." Ring said. 
·We have to minimize that." 

Senior outside hitter Mike 
Reuter and sophomore outside hit-
ter Russ Hardy led the Tritons with 
seven kiUs each and junior setter 
Brooks Dierdor-ff had 26 assists in 
the loss. The Tritons out-blocked 
the Lancers 11 to eight, but only hit 
.080 as a team. 

"We've worked on blocking a 
lot in practice and I was glad to see 
it," Ring said. "We've improved our 
defense, but we need to continue to 
score points." 

On Feb. 10. UCSD dropped a 
25-30, 21-30, 27-30 match against 
No. 4 Cal State Long Beach. With 
the win, Long Beach improved to 
11 -2 overall and 6-1 in the MPSF. 

Game one was close, as Cal 
State Long Beach held a slim lead 
of 23-26 before pulling away to 
record a 25-30 win. 

Game two never seemed close, 
as UCSD struggled and made a few 
costly errors, losing by nine points, 
21-30. 

With both teams going back 
and forth, the third game was the 

most competitive of the night. The 
4gers led most of the game, but 
the Tritons rallied back each time. 
With the score 11 - 15, UCSD tied 
the score at 19-19 with a small run. 
A service ace by sophomore middle 
blocker John Mark Wendler forced 
Cal State Long Beach into a time 
out. The teams would remain close 
and tied again for the last time at 
27-27. The 4gers managed to score 
the last three points, including a 
kill by senior outside hitter Robert 
Tarr, to beat the Tritons 27-30. 

"There were too many hit-
ting errors against good teams; 
Ring said. "When we're out of our 
system, it puts more pressure on 
the outside hitters. We're going to 
spend a lot of time in our side 
out game, hitting and passing this 
week." 

The Tritons were led by senior 
opposite Chris Sayers, who had 10 
kills, and Reuter, who had nine on 
a .412 hitting clip. Tarr's 12 kills led 
the 4gers. 

UCSD has a lot to prepare for 
before Feb. 16, when it hosts No.2 
Brigham Young University.

The game against Stanislaus 
spoke to the Tritons' balanced squad, 
with six Tritons scoring at least 
eight points. Patterson led the way 
with 20 points, while Poppen con-
tributed 13 as well as a game-high 
seven rebounds. Sophomore guard 
Jason Bull carne off the bench with 
a career-high 13

Justin Argenal responded with a

advantage. 

"There was definitely a .revenge 
factor on the minds of the returning 
players from last year. L\lst year we 
were young and their veteran group 
dominated us ," Hatch said.

"My first shot was an air-ball 
and my first two [three-pointers) 
didn't feel that great, but after that I 
just got going; Peters said. "I got in

The Tritons also took a while to 
heat up, allowing a 7-0 run by Chico 
State to start the game. After tying 
the game at 11. UCSD got its first 
lead with 10:53 to play after a Hatch 

double-digits at 
the 13:02 mark, 

and though the Wildcats climbed 
back to within three, they n\!ver 
found a way to contain Peters. After 
missing his first shot from long dis-
tance, Peters connected on five from 
downtown and totaled 18 second-
half pOints. 

Peters totaled a career-high 27 in 
the contest, while Allard added 13 
points, a game-high seven rebounds 
and five assists. As a team, the Tritons 
shot 53.2 percent from the field, 
60.1 percent in the second half, and 
forced 21 Chico State turnovers.

Tritons follow 70-56 
win over Wildcats 
in Chico with 81-77 
revenge win over Cal 
State Stanislaus. 

By Joe Tcvtlowitz 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

The Tritons might have been on 
the road again, but since they've 
already spent a good amount of this 
season traveling, it didn't seem to 
matter muoh. On the evening of Feb. 
10 at Acker Gym in Chico, Calif., 
UCSD defeated Chico State 70-56, 
completing a season sweep of a team 
that had beaten the Tritons by an 
average of 21 points last year. The 
next day, the Tritons avenged a 79-
75 home loss to Cal State Stanislaus 
by defeating the Warriors, 81 -77, 
in front of 1,232 fans at Warrior 
Arena. UCSD's record now stands at 
11 -12 overall and 8-6 in California 
CoUegiate Athletic Association play. 

The Tritons were prepared for 
Cal State Stanislaus in their Saturday 
contest, where Stanislaus' CCAA 
top-ranked offense was set to meet 
UCSD's top-ranked defense. 

"They beat [Cal State Sanl 
Bernardino last night, so they're 
coming off a hot game," junior guard 
Robby Peters said. "They're going to 
have a lot of confidence, so we have 
to get rid of that early - come in 
and make a strong statement." 

The initial statement wasn't near-
ly as strong as UCSD had hoped, 
falling behind by 11 with seven 
minutes played in the first half. 
However, the Tritons went on a 10-
3 run to cut the lead to 22-18 with 
9:12 remaining in the half, led by 
freshman forward Henry Patterson, 
who made seven shots from the 

field and three from the free-throw 
line. Cal State Stanislaus responded 
by slowly eXp.anding its lead again, 
taking anoth~r double-digit advan-
tage two minutes later. 

"Night in and night out we play 
teams that are more athletic than us, 
but we've proven we can beat these 
teams by playing poised and smarter 
than them," said sophomore guard 
Andrew Hatch. 

The pOise of the entire team and 
coaching staff was on display in 
the final 7:36 of the half. Using 11 
substitutions, head coach Bill Carr 
consistently sent fresh legs onto the 
court, and the team responded with 
a 15-4 run that gave the Tritons a 
35-34 advantage going into the half. 

Coming out of the locker room, 
the Tritons hoped to continue the 
momentum. Unfortunately, the 
team could not use a run to take a 
sizable advantage. After 15 second-
half lead changes, no team led by 
more than four points. However, 
at the 40-second mark, freshman 
guard Shane Poppen's jumper gave 
UCSD a 77-72 advantage and some 
breathing room. As was expected 
from the tightly contested game, 
Stanislaus made one last charge, 
climbing to within two after a Joel 
Stallworth layup. However, sopho-
more guard Clint Allard made 2-of-
4 free throws in the final 14 seconds 
and rebounded Marcus Martinez's 
three-point attempt to secure the 
road win. 

"Winning on the road adds to 
our confidence [and) beating a team 
that trash talks like Stanislaus just 
makes us feel good about ourselves," 
Hatch said. "Tonight we respond-
ed by systematically beating them. 
Getting a dunk gets them gOing, so 
we respond by getting '3 wide open

Host Tritons Go 2-0 on Last Day 
Women's water polo 
·ends annual Triton 
Invitational with a 
3-2 record, including . 
upset over UC Irvine. 

By Lauren Kato 
STAFF WRITER 

The UCSD women's water polo 
team split its first two games at the 
annual Triton Invitational on Feb. 
II, defeating Pomona-Pitzer in the 
fust bout with a score of 10-5, but 
falling just short against No. 9 Cal 
State Long Beach later that day, 10-
8. 

The No. 17 Tritons hit the water 
full force against Pomona-Pitzer, 
leading 1-0 at the end of the first 
quarter after a quick goal by junior 
Michelle Perkins. The Sagehens tied 
the game at 1-1 in the second, but 
two clutch goals by junior Sarah 
Bajorek, both within the four-min-
ute mark, gave UCSD the lead at 
intermission. 

After the break, both teams 
scored twice, bringing the tally to 5-
3 in favor of the Tritons. Sophomore 
Nicole liermann netted one goal 
and last week's UCSD Athlete of 
the Week, sophomore Judy Emaus, 
banked the other one in. 

In the fourth quarter, the Tritons 
hit their stride, netting a whopping 
five goals. Bajorek, the thi~d-Ieading 
scorer in 2005, scored twice more, 
bringing her total to four on the day. 
Hermann, Emaus and Perkins also 
each found the goal again, increas-
ing the lead over Pitzer before the 
buzzer rang to signify the 10-5 
Triton win. 

In the second game of the day, 
the Tritons found themselves pitted 
against No. 9 Cal State Long Beach.

By Nicky Buchanan 
STAFF WRITER 

The No. 21 UCSD women's bas-
ketball team has been all over the 
board in the last couple of weeks. 
The team dropped from a consis-
tent and exciting 11 -game win-
ning streak to two-straight loses 
to No. 13 Cal State Bakersfield 
on Feb. 3 and No. 17 Chico State 
on Feb. 10. The Tritons jumped 
back into their rhythm on Feb. 11, 
however, when they worked Cal 
State Stanislaus in Warrior Arena 
with a convincing 89-58 win. The 
Tritons are definitely keeping fans 
at the edge of the bleachers with 
their recent unpredictability, and 
now stand at 16-4 overall and 11 -3 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. 

With a record like Cal State 
Stanislaus', 6-15 overall, 2-12 
CCAA, it's no surprise that their 
night ended in defeat at the hands 
of the Tritons; the win may have 
been just the confidence boost that 
the Tritons needed to get back 
their steady stance. The Warriors 
clung as close as they could in the 
first half, holding their last lead of 
the game, 13-12, at the 12-minute 
mark. UCSD got the baU roll -
ing (and into the basket for that 
matter) too steadily for Cal State 
Stanislaus to keep up. 

The Tritons headed into break 
with a 40-25 lead and didn't give it 
up for the rest of the game. Thirty-
three Warrior turnovers helped the 
effort, along with the never-failing 
scoring techniques of junior guard 
Leora Juster, who added 26 points 
in the win. 

Freshman forward Michelle 
Osier helped out with a game-
high 11 rebounds and 15 points, 
along with junior forward Hillary 
Hansen, who picked up four 
boards and three steals, and added 
10 points. 

The game against Chico State 
on Feb. 10 marked the Tritons' 
first two-game losing streak of the 
season. The Wildcats responded to 
a close 79-77 to the Tritons back 
on Jan. 7, when UCSD was in the 
middle of their eventual ll-game 
win streak, with a lopsided 90-68 
defeat at Acker Gym. 

Chico State came out strong 
and mustered a firm lead early on 
at 13-2, bumping it up to 31-17 by 
the end of the half. The Tritons 
just couldn't get the accuracy they 
needed, netting only 11 of 38 shots 
from the floor. 

Though UCSD picked up their 
game a bit more in the second half, 
as they usllllly do, it just wasn't 
enough to overcome the 22-point 
margin of victory for the win. It 
was a bad night for the Tritons, as 
they committed 22 turnovers in 
the nlalch. 

Despite Juster's eight success-
ful charity shots, she feU short
