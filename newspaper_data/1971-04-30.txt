Palcic to Propose $3 
Student Fee for EOP 

Carl Neiburger 
City Editor 

AS President Mike (Heavy) 
Palcic informed the TRITON 
TIMES yesterday he will 
propose that the AS raise its 
fees by $3 per quarter to be 
utilized exclusively for a 
financial aids-EOP scholarship 
fund . 

Palcic said he will ask the AS 
council today to place the 
proposal on the ballot for the 
AS election run-offs. "There is 
a critical need on this campus 
for funds for financial aid and 
EOP, " he told the TRITON 
TIMES. 

The need for funds, Palcic 
explained, is due to the fact 
that while neVI students 
requiring financial aid will be 
entering UCSD this fall , no new 
sources for these funds are 
available. He observed that 
EOP is presently funded 
entirely from federal sources 
and the University registration 
fee ($100 per quarter paid by 
each student ). 

"No state funds are going 
directly into the EOP program, 
and although our legislative 
lobby is trying to get the state 
to allocate funds, in all 
probability the Governor is 
going to be true to himself and 
veto the funds," Palcic said. 
He noted that the university 
had requested $1 ,500,000 as a 
state allocation to the program 
but, "Reagan's budget says 
'zero.' " 

Another possible source of 
income, Palcic stated, is the 
Educa tional (tuition) fee 
passed by the Regents last year 
which will increase to $100 per 
student per quarter next fall . 
"The Student Body Presidents 

Council has recommended 
unanimously to the President 
(Charles Hitch ) that he 
appropriate half of the 
Education fee" to financial aid. 
He noted, however, that the 
regents declined a similar 
proposal last year. 

Palcic noted that "Students 
on other campuses have 
initiated similar fees to 
demonstrate their support of 
low income and minority 
students in the university." He 
commented that " the governor 
will support EOP students in 
the junior colleges. He just 
won 't support them in the 
university. " 

Palcic said he expected the 
fee " will produce $40,000 to 
$45,000 in additional income for 
EOP" which, he said, would 
provide the equivalent of 40-45 
scholarships. "All students on 
EOP, " he said, "will have 
some unmet need. This will 
alleviate some of the unmet 
need." 

Earlier this quarter , 
Financial Aids Director 
Lawrence Dryer indicated that 
with 200 new EOP students 
expected, the university lacks 
the equivalent of 
approximately 100 scholarships 
if it were to maintain students 
at present levels of support. At 
that time, Dryer said he 
expected this problem would be 
solved by cutting the average 
EOP grant by approximately 
$100. 

Palcic noted that a two-
thirds vote is required to pass 
fee increases. In the past, the 
Chancellor has also required a 
60 per cent voter turnout.

The two-day conference entitled 
"Revolution, Reform, and Conscience"

Sociology, Theology linked by Priest 
G/ena Schroeter 

Staff Writer 
Speaking on "Sociology and the Spirit" last Tuesday evening 

was Father Gregory Baum, leading ecumenical theologian and 
author of the recent book, "Man Becoming." 

Having studied sociology for the past two years at the new 
School for Social Research in New York City, Father Baum 
stated that he has found sociology tying-in , in many ways, to 
his own theological education. Father Baum proceeded then to 
illuminate on the creation of the sociological condition, and 
how closely it relates to the kinds of things that Christians talk 
about. 

He first discu sed the origin of sociology as a SCience, 
referring to its beginnings in the 19th Century as a critical 
reflection on the new society which was in the making. In 
reference to Ulis. Father Baum de ignated three prevailing 
trends of the times, to which sociology became the 
countervailing force . 

Th first prevailing trend that h discussed was 
individualism. He explained that man wa coming to regard 
himself as an isolated ubject. Emphasis was being put on 
society as a somewhat contextual organism that preceded the 
individual. rather than society a an organically interwoven 
community, characterized by sharing and participation. 
Father Baum likened this to the countervailing trend in the 
church, to get away from external ceremonies, and back to a 
more community-type fellowship of sharing and participation. 

CHrcbe. I~ .. ted from tile o.t ide 
He reflected that just as man has isolated himself, so to 

some extent have the churches inoculated themselves again t 
the outside. However, the countervailing trend away from thi 
is becoming increasingly apparent. From a sociological point 

of view, it is the youths' groping need and attempt to get inside 
themselves and touch the emotional aspects of the body, 
instead of merely regarding themselves as i olated objects, 
that characterizes this reaction against individualism. 
Theologically. Christians are becoming more concerned with 
Jesu Christ and His true words, rather than outward 
uperficialities. 
The second trend of which Father Baum poke was that of 

rationalism. characteristic of the enlightenment. For example, 
Descartes rationalized man as the empty subject and reality as 
the object. knowledge bridging the two together. Sociologi ts 
reacted again t this way of relating to society as a separate 
entity. They held that society wa a reality not totaH outside 
ourselves, but intricately a part of us. Neither did sociologists 

re~ard man as a.1I that rational. They claimed that the thing 
whIch make us ttck are so deeply woven into our history, that 
we cannot make them totally con cious to our lve . 

Relating this to theology, Fath r Baum recognized that men 
have also alienated themselve from th divine within th m. 
This, h noted. has made them not totally op n to the reality in 
which they live. Fath r Baum expre sed the hope that 
eventually, through the creation of a new con ciou ne , man 
would become more open to hi- divine reality, from which his 
rational pa t ha cut him off. 

Mu Depicted 5 a MacbiDe 
The third prevailing trend of the 19th Century, according to 

Father Baum. was the appr ciation of technology. A th 
countervailing force , ~ ~ Icl() i"t3 ... MAI ;. J ttiÂ· tj""tru .. tive

Schiller: As of the moment I am the director of the program.

Schiller: That can be answered in a de facto sense; by that I 
mean, what 's actually going to happen in terms of people, 
courses, possibilities to major . We will be offering a wider 
range of courses in the various areas of communications ; we 
will have a staff on campus in communications and in fields

n : What is the scope of a "typical" commUDications 
department? What areas are usually included in a model 
communications department and how similar or different will 
the UCSD communications department be? 

Sc~er : There is no such thinJ as a typical communi~ations 
department. We plan on having something that is unique. We 
are not attempting to set up a journalism school. We are going 
to be carving out our own area. We are not going to fall in line 
with other schools. 

Most of the kinds of communication courses that we would be 
interested in are now only offered (Ilr the most part at graduate 
levels if it is being offered at all . But almost nowhere in the 
country are these courses offered at the undergraduate level. 
This is research in the mass media, human communications, 
communications systems, behavior , communications 
behavior, public opinion, content analysis, systems 
theory-most of these are usually graduate courses. 

Now what we are doing, first of all, is implementing the 
academic plan of Third College. One major orientation is to 
direct the study of communications on the undergraduate level 
(as outlined by the plan) and later on the graduate level to the 
basic needs of minority peoples. People who have not, for 
many reasons, been able to participate in the communications 
process. In the sense of having their views expressed in the 
mainstream channels, we will be examining to what sense they 
have been excluded, why they have been excluded, what are the 
opportunities for changing this exclusion into participation. 
Can the new technology assist in this, or won't it? These are the 
questions that we will be talking about. And of course assisting 
the students to see these issues critically and to participate 
wherever possible in their own individual ways, as well as to 
understand the social context in which they are operating. 

So our undergraduate program has a dual approach. One, of 
attempting to understand the communications process, both as 
a social process and a personal process. And secondly, a 
definite relatedness to the specific needs of minority students. 
So this is the uniqueness of Third College and the UCSD 
communications program. From there we will build into the 
advanced kinels of graduate research that one expects to 
develop as we create a campus department of 
communications. 
'M': What major categories of study will the program be 
concerned with? 
ScbUer: One major category will be the analysis of social 
institutions and social structures of communications. By that 
we mean just how these processes are organized , what kind of 
social control, organizational structures, financial inputs , the 
whole basis upon which the media are organized as they are . 
What guides the structure of newspapers, what guides the

arrangement of radio stations, what guides and what organizes 
and what principles determine how television and film are 
structured. 

Another major area will be the study of the actual 
communications behavior and the way it operates on the 
individual. Here we will discuss the areas of public opinion 
making, what constitutes public opinion, how is public opinion 
organized, what is an attitude, how are attitudes created and 
changed, what are the impacts of mass media on personal ' 
behavior as related to these individual psvchological 
relationships and communications relationships. 

A third area , which I think is crucial and one in which UCSD 
will be in the forefront, will be the area of g~neral 
communications theory, systems theory, the whole nolton of 
communications as a systems operatIOn . Here 
communications is defined as total behavior, an area where 
Professor Wilden is involved with. 

Finally, we would devise a program for the students 
themselves to utilize the media , so they know what the 
technology is so we are not alway~ talki~g in an abstract w.ay. 
Study which could lead to careers m radIO, teleVISIOn, and film 
making. This area will need time ~nd a gre~t de~1 of reso~rces 
before it can develop on a profeSSIOnal baSIS. ThiS area Will be 
tied to the more general areas of theory that I have discussed. I 
don 't want a film studio to develop independent of the total 
communications picture that we are trying to present.

each answer, was particularly pleased 
with a comment of van den Haag that 
"punishments work better t~an 
rewards" in reference to a questlon 
about crime. He suggested that two 
reforms could be instituted which would 
cut down crime greatly. The first 
reform would be to eliminate the 
jurisdiction which federal courts have in 
criminal matters and the other reform 
would be to allow any evidence. no 
matter how procured, to be admissible 
against a suspect. Van den Haag said he 
would like a law which would allow a 
defendant to sue in case of illegal 
evidence gathering but that the evidence 
should still be admitted. He said he saw 
no reason why a criminal should go free 
"just because the method of gathering 
evidence is considered illegal. " 

The closing session of the symposium 
on Tuesday was devoted largely to 
questions from the comparatively small 
audience. One man was critical of the 
fact that the panelists did not 
participate in a format which allowed 
them to debate non-conservatives. Dr. 
van den Haag answered that he was 
ready to debate anytime. 

Asked about the heavy security at the 
opening session , DIMENS ION staffer 
Sills said he "expected trouble." Sills 
said he was satisfied with the number of 
people present. DIMENSION editor 
Keating said he was " encouraged by the 
number of openÂ·minded people here 
tonight, individuals who are not afraid of 
hearing the other side." 

Buckley's Wit Shines 
Buckley, who was only able to attend 

the Monday night session, showed hi s 
wellÂ·publicized wit during the questionÂ· 
and-answer period . When asked why he

One question asked was why there 
hadn 't been discussion of the role of the 
Communist Party in " infiltrating" 
colleges. Van den Haag said that the 
Communists have "never been terribly 
effective." Dartmouth Professor Hart 
disagreed saying that he knew of 
" incidences at Berkeley where 
individuals were hired for their political 
beliefs. " He said he considered that to 
be a "plot. " Evans said there have been 
various conspiracies "at work in this 
country." He cited the Washington anti Â·

"very pleased" with the response to the

unconscious , of which they were not even aware . Father Baum 
states that this goes along with theology's idea of sin ; that 
destruction is woven into human life, and onl y an encounter 
with God 's word reveals it to us. 

Father Baum said tha t like the Pharisees (the high priests ) 
of biblical times, men cannot see their sin by just looking at 
themselves. Because of power. selfÂ·delusion and self-
possession, the Pharisees withdrew themselves from 
criticism, and therefore reality. Man, he felt , is often guilty of 
the same today. 

He concluded the lecture by proposing that the only cure for 
humanity is a new consciousness. Theologically peaking, he 
said that people must discover the destructive things they do to 
one another, and the marvelous things (works of God ) which 
happen in their midst.

Save The Thumb 
In today's TRITON TIMES is the 

first of a two part article by Bruce G. 
Weniger, a Berkeley law student, 
dealing with a proposed "anti-
hitchhiking" bill now in committee in 
the State Legislature. OstenSibly the 
purpose of Senate Bill 92 is to combat 
rape and robbery. But, as Weniger 
brought out there is little evidence to 
support the supposition that the 
passage of this bill will reduce this 
typeof crime. 

An inevitable reSUlt, however, is 
that it will cut off a vital means of 
transportation for many people in the 
state of California. We find it hard to 
believe that whatever benefits the bill 
might accrue in "crime prevention," 
would really offset the hardships it 
will impose on certain segments of 
society, espeCially the people who are 
young and poor. 

There can be no denying that much 

Save Your Life 
As long as we are recommending 

that students make their views known 
on pending legislation, we feel you 
should be aware of an issue of even 
more crucial importance to 
students-the DRAFT. In today's 
letters-to-the-editor, Florence Stevens 
(Chairman of the La Jolla-San Diego 
branch of a movement to repeal the 
draft) lets us know that the U.S. 
Senate will soon have to vote on 
whether or not to extend the draft. 

The " peace time" draft is a 
relatively new phenomenon and is 
contrary to American tradition. 

of the present suppor' for Senate Bill 
92 as a crime preventive measure is 
Simply a cover-up for an adverse 
reaction to the "counter culture." The 
California Highway Patrol's liaison 
officer with the Legislature has made 
it known to Senator John Nejedly, 
author of the bill, that from a police 
viewpoint the bill is unnecessary, and 
that it will simply further strain 
relations between police and young 
people. The bill's potential for 
legitimizing pOlice harrassment of 
young people, we feel, is self-evident. 

We encourage all students who feel 
they have an interest at stake to make 
their views known. Today's article 
tells how public opinion has already 
managed to modify the bill once. In 
Tuesday's TT Weniger shows who the 
key legislators are and how they can 
best be influenced. 

California senators are divided on the 
issue. Cranston will vote against 
extension. But, Tunney is uncertain . 
His vote will probably be determined 
by what he gauges the public's opinion 
to be. 

The War in Indo-China is now being 
fought by soldiers who don't want to be 
there and a cessation of the draft 
would force Nixon to conclude our 
involvement in Southeast Asia. As 
recommended by Florence Stevens, 
you can make your views known to 
Tunney through Gordon Walker, his 
San Diego Field Representative.

'Be(ouse There's 
Something in the Air. .. ' 

by Mark Elson 
I have been with KSDT for three years as music director , 

station manager, and am currently coordinating our efforts to 
acquire an FM frequency. I feel it necessary to brief all of the 
student community on KSDT's progranuning policy, recent 
attempts to expand, and, although it really isn 't worthwhile, to 
answer current irresponsible criticism which is false and 
which would only help to create a campaign issue where none 
exists. I must explain what really is the case so that 
candidate's lies can be laid to rest. 

Firstly, KSDT has been criticized as an expensive toy which 
is run by a few know-it-ails who are "filling their pockets" by 
being paid exorbitant stipends. Despite inferences that have 
appeared in minor campus media, three station executives are 
paid collectively $SIlO quarterly, which is not a whole bunch for 
maintaining a round-the-clock, seven-<tay-a-week operation . 
The allegation that KSDT is an expensive toy simply is not 
true. 

We believe that as many students as possible should be able 
to hear KSDT which is the reason we are seeking FM 
educational status. At present there are six other campus FM 
stations in the UC system. A major means of instantaneous 
mass communication is vital to our campus. Yet the local 
administration is difficult to convince of the feasibility of an 
FM station here. The Triton Times is a tangible product that 
anyone can read whereas the radio medium is invisible. It is 
only right to ask where the money would go (1), especially when 
its immediate effects will not be seen . 

What will we be getting for the money? KSDT-FM will 
provide programming that is important to the campus 
community ; programming that is " relevant". We will be 
required by the FCC to air a certain percentage of news, public 
affairs, and educational programming. All pre-recorded music 
is classed as 'light entertainment.' 

The bulk of our programming has been and is now music 
because it is inexpensive and requires less expertise than 
either news or public affairs reporting. The music 
programming philosophy is that music should be presented on 
radio as an art form in itself . The format includes virtually all 
types of music and although student taste dictates an emphasis 
on current rock , no one has attempted to make KSDT into 
another KPRI. Who needs that? At any rate KSDT-FM will 
exist to provide programming which is alternative to 
commercial radio. 

We are prevented from supporting ourself via commercials 
because (1) there are no commercial frequencies available to 
us and (2) educational institutions are assigned non-
commercial FM frequencies . Innovation and experimentation 
will be the keys to our programming. This is where the true 
educational exp rience bears fruit. Live public affairs 
discussions, accurate news coverage of happenings that affect 
us all , and excellent music programs will be presented. 

Our editorial policy requires that equal time be given to 
responsible opposing points of view. In all honesty, our best 
non-music programming has been accomplished through 
super-human efforts in that we have never been equipped to 
extend the range of the potential that is available to us. Arrests 
of our reporters in Berkeley and Isla Vista demonstrate the 
risks we have gone to when the word must be spread. Our 
present facilities are utilized to the utmost. 

KSDT has been and will be open to anyone who wants to 
become involved in it. We need fresh ideas to create a new 
sound in the air. KSDT is the students ' station to become a part 
of and to listen to. Let's use it. We 've got a lot to say , you know. 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Final Exams 
NOTICE 
SAN DIEGO: OFFICE OF 
THE CHANCELLOR 

April 7. 1971 
TO: ALL FACULTY 

SUBJECf: Final Examinations 

My attention has been called 
to instances in which the 
published final examination 
schedule has not been followed . 

Two specific instances are 
those in which final 
examinations are given on the 
'free day' and those in which 
the student is given a take-
home exam to turn in on the 
last day of instruction. 

I understand that those 
instructors who do give 
examinations on the 'free day ' 
only to do when the students 
have agreed in a classroom 
that they are willing to have 
this happen. However . even 
though the students appear to 
be agreeable to thi s scheme. 
some are not but may be 
reluctant to be disagreeable. I 
must point out that the 'free 
day' has been reserved for 
students to tudy for all his 
exams. and the ' exam ination 
schedule specifically indicates 

that no exams are to be given 
on this day. Also, by requiring 
an early submission of 
examination materials, the 
student is being denied the 
critical time required "to put it 
all together." Thus. deviating 
from the published 
examination schedule works 
undue hardships on the 
students concerned . and-such 
deviation represents a gross 
discourtesy to the students . 

However. above and beyond 
such argument s. Senate 
regulations provide that the 
examinations must be given in 
the regularly- scheduled time 
periods . Deviations from the 
Senate regulations must be 
approved in advance by the 
Committee on Courses acting 
through the Committee on 
Educational Policy. 

Therefore. I request that all 
faculty comply with the final 
examination schedule as 
published unless a variance is 
granted by the Committee on 
Educational Policy.

Surprisingly, this amendment does 
not offer much of a change, because 
three rarely-enforced sections of the

next to any red curb, at any bus stop, in 
front of any driveway, at freeway entry 
ramps, on the roadway side of any 
parked vehicle, and at other places. 
These places are the most common, and 
often the safest, spots at which people 
hitchhike. It is hard to find a place along 
most urban and suburban thoroughfares 
where stopping is permitted. 

The University of California 's Library 
of Transportation in Richmond, the 
largest , library on transportation 
subjects in the country, has not a

A Minor Change 
Since his original bill was 

Senator Nejedly has had a 
of heart, bu t not enough 

Of course, policemen only enforce 
these no-stopping rules-unless they are 
trying to harass someone-against 
drivers who have made clearly 
dangerous maneuvers. But Senate Bill 
92 would permit police to arrest anyone 
standing a any of these places just for 
sticking out his thumb. It is obvious that 
this law would be an effective device for 
the police to harass people with 
unorthodox life styles and appearances. 

Rape & Robbery 
Senator Nejedly told this 

commentator in a recent trip to 
Sacramento that his original intent was 
to combat the crime that occurs in 
connection with hitchhiking, such as 
robberies and rapes committed against 
both drivers and hitchhikers. He cited a 
letter from San Francisco Police Chief 
Alfred Neider, reporting an increase in 
hitchhike rapes in that city from 5 in 
1965 to 73 in 1970, and an increase in 
hitchhike robberies from none to 83. 

The Opposition Argues 
Individuals opposed to Senate Bill 92 

have come forward with a variety of 
reasons why this bill should be defeated, 
all of which reduce themselves to a 
concern for people. 

First of all, there are so many people 
in this state who depend on hitchhiking 
for transportation : youth, servicemen, 
and poor people travel this pollution-free 
way to schools, jobs, stores, beaches, 
and parks, primarily because public 
transportation is woefully inadequate, 
slow, expensive, and often non-existent. 

Concern for our environment, which is 
another way of saying concern for 
ourselves as living beings, is another 
reason many ecologically-aware 
persons oppose unnecessary restrictions 
on hitchhiking. The state should be 
eDcouragiDg, not discouraging, all forms 
of ride-sharing in order to make better 
use of existing automobiles and 
highways. To restrict hitchhiking would 
increase the need to use one's own 
automobile. Our poisoned air and 
concretized landscape is proof enough 
that an automobile-oriented culture 
is- as the Surgeon General might print 
on the side of cars-" hazardous to our 
health".

The senator was unable to quote any 
statistics on the total amount of 
hitchhiking done in California, such as 
the number of rides given or the 
distances travelled . Since most crimes 
are measured in terms of ratios, such as 
the number of murders or larcenies per 
thousand population, it is impossible to 
determine the danger of hitchhiking 
until we know the extent of hitchhiking 

California conservationists know that 
Senator Nejedly is compiling a laudable 
record for his sponsorship and support of 
legislation protecting the environment. 
Senate Bill 92 would not be consistent 
with that record.

Demonopolize the Post Office 
Roy Nelson 

Lately there has been much 
in the newspapers and 
television about all the good 
services we are going to enjoy 
after the new postal rates go 
into effect on or about May 15. 
l ist class mail will be 8 cents, 
airmail 11 cents, specia l 
delivery 60 cents and post cards 
6 cents). This may be so but 
judging from the experiences 
of past increases, we may 
surely doubt it. Actually 
service to the public ha 
steadily declined in the past as 
pay increase and improved 
working conditions were 
granted to postal employees. 

Postal rates have varied 
considerably in the past. 
During the years 1816-1845 the 
following rates were in effect: 

One letter: 
not going over 30 miles cost 6 
cents 
not going over 80 miles cost 10 
cents 
not going over ISO miles cost 
12 'h cents 
not gOing over 400 miles cost 
1a:Y. cents 
greater distances cost 25 cents 

In 1845 Congress passed 
legislation making it illegal for 
private companies to carry 
mail. This wa s directed 
primarily against th e 
American Letter Mail Co, 
which boasted that they would 
deliver 1st class mail at 5 cents 
each letter. twenty for a dollar. 

The man who started this 
compan y wa s Lysand er 
Spoon r, an attorney and 
American anarchist. At tha t 

time and sinc'e then he has been 
given credit for the reasonable 
rates charged by the Post 
Office. 

In the 1880's Wells Fargo & 
Co . wa s suc c essfully 
competing with the U. S. Post 
Office in the western states and 
territories. Well s Fargo 
service was not only more 
complete. reaching more 
points, but it was also safer and 
faster . This was in spite of the 
fact that it had to charge 5 
cents for each letter against 3 
cents for the regular U. S. Post 
Office rate . Wells Fargo had to 
pay a tribute of over 3 cents per 
letter to the government. 

About the same time the Post 
Office was carrying 
newspapers for $1 per hundred 
pounds for 2,000 miles, while 
paying the railroads 3 times 
what it should, and losing about 
$5 per trip. The los was made 
up by overcharging on 1st class 
mail and by taxes on the 
general public in other areas . 

We now hear that the 
newspaper and magazine 
lobbies in Washington are 
protesting the increase in 2nd 
class mail and contesting the 
right of the Post Office to so 
raise them. 

Making the Post Office a 
public corporation is a step in 
the right direction . The next 
step should be to remove its 
monopoly privileges. If the 
Post Office can ucces full y 
compete again st private 
enterpri e carrying the mall 
cheaper, faster and safer than 
its competition, then its 
exist nce would be justified.

Free all Political Prisoners 
Brian O'Brien 

The FAPP by 'Brian O'Brien movement has 
had some great successes, and of course 
success in disturbing the status quo brings 
reaction. We in the movement have to learn to 
handle this reaction, to survive it and turn it on 
its creators. We can't afford to win battles and 
lose the war . Not here in the U.S. - it 's too 
important tq people all over ~he world. 

We've survived the red-baiting and the first 
intimidating attacks by police and national 
guard and we'll survive the co-option and race-
baiting that 's in vogue now in the government 
and the press. The attack in the courts, 
however, is more subtle and may be more 
difficult to combat. Jackson, Kent, and Chicago 
aren't hard to understand but the courts cloak 
the repression in a barrage of legalisms and on 
appearance of fairness. The long drawn out 
prosecutions drain our energy and finances, 
which are always limited. Charges, counter-
charges, and complicated legal maneuvering 
confuse the sympathetic and even those within 
the movement. 

Committee, experienced people are kept out 
of action for long periods, either in jail or 
devoting everything to staying out. All the while 
the press and the politicians are moaning about 
permissive judges and expensive movement 
lawyers perpetuating the myth of the helpless 
giant assailed by well organized and vicious 

gnats. Conspiracy defendants are criminals, 
Angela Davis, George Jackson and on and on 
are criminals-cold and calculating, even 
bloodthirsty. There is no such thing as a 
political trial in the U.S. 

That's the kind of thing we're up against. The 
ever-increasing use of this strategy from 
campus (injunctions of Spring '70) to the White 
House shows that they believe it 's working. We 
have some evidence to the contrary. Defendants 
are eschewing narrow legalistic defense. Trials 
are being used as forums to educate and to build 
SUDoort for peace and against racism and 
inhumanity. It 's an uphill battle, though, and it 
requires thought and organization. It requires 
commitment and energy. This committee wants 
to help build , to help lay down the foundations 
for support of those who are prosecuted for 
being effective and in the forefront. 

We urge everyone to attend the symposium 
Friday night in the Revelle cafeteria . Hear 
lawyers and defendants from major cases, 
including Howard Moore (Angela 's chief 
counsel), Oscar Rios (from Los Siete) and Tom 
Hayden (of the Chicago 8), discuss the 
implications of current political repression and 
what we can do to make it a double failure by 
helping to free Angela , Ruchell , Gonzales ... and 
by keeping the pressure on against the war and 
racial and economic exploitation.

Rock Concert 

Tomorrow Night 
As an apt conclusion to 

Mayday and the Rites of 
Spring, the AS Program Board 
is sponsoring an unusual 
concert, featuring Dan Hicks 
and His Hot Licks and Jesse 
Davis. Hicks and His Licks are 
a five member band with two 
girl singers, lwin violins, a wild 
bass, all together producing a 
" wry bundle of country-
western, 40's harmony and a 
little rock 'n' roiL" 

Jesse Davis, a guitarist who 
has played with Eric Clapton, 
Leon Russell and Taj Mahal, is 
now gigging on his own. 

The concert is tomorrow 
night at 8:30 in the gym. The 
Urey Hall Box OrÂ£jce has 
tickets on sale, priced at $1 for 
UCSD students, $2.50 for other 
college students, and $3 for the 
general public . 

Camus Play at 
Old Globe 

Albert Camus' "Caligula" is 
the final Old Globe Theatre 
production of the current 
season . Seventeen 
performances are scheduled 
from April 29 through May 16 
nightly except Monday at the 

Cassius Carter Centre Stage in 
Balboa Park. 

Roman emperor Caligula 
(37-41 A.D.) imposed his 
interpretation of "truth" on his 
subjects by ruthless 
extermination of all critical of 
his decisions. Unfaithful to 
mankind through fidelity only 
to himself, Caligula represents 
playwright Camus' theory-that 
one cannot destroy everything 
without destroying oneself. 

Students through college may 
purchase tickets to "Caligula" 
at $1.50 for all performances 
except Saturday evening. The 
reduced price tickets are a 40 
per cent savings off the regular 
ticket price. 

Keaton Festival 
Raymond Rohauer's festival 

of the films of Buster Keaton 
will be presented by the 
Unicorn Cinema in La Jolla for 
20 days, April 28 through May 
17. The entire festival consists 
of 10 features and 21 short 
films, which will be presented 
in rotation as individual 
programs of one feature and 
two or three shorts. 

The films , made between 
1917 and 1927, represent the 
very best of Keaton's work as 
an actor and director, and 
many must be considered 
masterpieces of silent film . 
Keaton was only 22 when he 

made "Tbe Butcher Boy" with 
Fatty Arbuckle in 1917, but by 
the time he made "Steamboat 
Bill Jr," in 1927, he had 
elevated his own style of

rock 'n' roll. and rhythm and 
blues. Her performance puts

"Ribbons in Space" 
Sculpture by David 

Herschler and Melvin Schuler 
and an untitled photographic 
suite by Joe Goode will be the 
new offerings at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art 
from May 1 through June 6. 

Herschler's constructions, 
generally labelled "Ribbons in 
Space," are one-inch bands of 
stainless steel, twisted and 
wound into curves and spirals. 
Most are mounted on a base; a 
few, suspended from the 
ceiling, move slowly with the 
light air currents in a room. 

Melvin Schuler's work is 
done in richly grained wood, 
predominantly black walnut. 
Hewn from large timbers, the 
sculptures are made of beams, 
blocks and carved undulations 
of wood, which may be 
composed vertically, 
horizontally or suspended in 
steel "Cages. " 

The photographic works in 
Joe Goode's exhibition were 
created by an unusual process. 
3" x 6" photographs of clouds 
were placed, collage fashion , 
on a white wall. Dry ice was

"Ecology of 
the Skin" 

David Rosenboom 
composer , performer , 
conductor and physicist - will 
present a concert designed to 
show how human brain waves 
can be used to play music on an 
electronic system, today at 
UCSD. The concert , entitled 
"Ecology of the Skin," is at 12 
noon in 409 MC and is sponsored 
by the UCSD Musici)epartment. 

"Ecology of the Skin" is an 
outgrowth of Rosenboom 's 
research in neurophysics and 
biofeedback systems done at 

the State University of New 
York. 

At York University 
Rosenboom has been working 
with students testing his theory 
that people can control the type 
of brain waves they emit, and 
hence their psychophysical 
states or moods. He connects 
electrodes 10 the skin of their 
heads and feeds the impulses 
they emit into a computer he 
designed and built.

"SANDS OF 

View From 
The Roek 

Rocky Halfan 
Sports Editor 

As a joke, someone asked me yesterday how the elections 
would affect the sports scene at UCSD. I answered that the 
elections were just that, a joke, but that as an ex-poli sci major 
I could forsee some deep repercussions arising from the 
present elections If picked that up from Walter Cronkite 's 
"campaign 70" - When in doubt, bullshit .) 

[n any case, it has been my keen observation that this year, 
more so than at any previous time, a moderate, if not a 
downright flag waving conservative, has a good chance to win 
the election. With candidates like Kaufman and Keating doing 
well so far , I have concluded (rom their temporary strength 
that the middle and right sectors of our school are reacting by 
voting whiplash to whal has happened to the previous AS. 

This conservative trend would seem to uphold a new look on 

Volleyball: 
A Net Loss 
We worked hard, and we 

played well all year, but we got 
to Texas, and we just couldn 't 
put it together. This was the 

few hours later, the TRITONS 
met Church College of Hawaii, 
a team which the coach 
described as the best volleyball 
team I've seen play all year, 
and I've seen UCLA and Santa 
Barbara play." The TRITONS 

'dropped two more to the 
Hawaiians. 

problem in a nutshell for UCSD was now (H but still 
volleyball coach Chuck game. Now they met George 
Millenbaugh whose defending Williams, from Illinois. Again 
champion TRITONS had to the TRITONS dropped two,

stunned in their first game were okay, but they weren' t as 
against Graceland. Leading in sharp as they knew they could 
the beginning with a score of ........... . 13-6, the TRITONS lost 15-13. !II 
This was to set the pattern for I I 

campus. Girls are dr~ssing-up a bit m"re, so are guys, and 
their .frequency of datmg has gone up (so have burglaries, but 
that IS another story) . What this is all leading to is but one 
thIDg, t~e conclusion that this school is pushing strongly for 
apple pie and motherhood . And what goes better with that than 
here it comes - football . ' 

I've said it. Yes football , for two years a dead institution at 
UCSD, but now about to be resurrected by major support from 
the student body. Can you see it? Saturday or Sunday sitting at 
the bleachers and watching Triton football? It wouldn't be the 
best in the world, but it would be entertaining. Here are a few 
thoughts on the subject : 
. UCSD ~ad a football team in '68. The team wasn 't great , butÂ· 
It was enjoyable to watch. It had a definite place at UCSD . But, 
because of the size of the school, and the terribly innovative 
mood on campus, football was quietly done away with. Now 
that the school has grown, and some not - so - involved kids 
have infiltrated the campus, a new bi~th is at hand . There are 
no real reasons for not having a football team . It wouldn 't cost 
the school a cent, ~or the players would continue to play on a 
nonscholarshlp baSIS. As for the uniforms, we have enough of 
those from '68 to field the best looking team in San Diego 

Anyway why not have one? We have drama for drama 
students, chorus for singers. why not have football for red-
blooded Americans. I'm sure Keating and Kaufman would both 
stand on their platform and applaud such a move. As for Diddo 
Clark, well it took her 19 years to lose her virgi ni ty. and once 
she did, she couldn 't see why he waited so long. Football has 
only been removed for two years but I'm sure Diddo wouldn 't 
want to vacillate again . ' 

Well so much for politics. It seems that football is a pretty 
safe issue, and anyway if it does go throu gh, it just might be as 
entertaining as watching the AS. 

be. 
Finally, at 6:30, they played 

Dallas and won. At least the 
ream members could go home 
to their hotel with a win under 
their belts. The next morning 
the TRITONS again played 
Dallas, and again they beat 
them, final record 4-8. [n the 
end the TRITONS were given 

an award- the team with the 
longest hair- not exactly first 
place, but... 

ft goes without saying that 
the team was disappointed, 
that is an understatement, but 
as Mohammed Ali said, in 
defeat there is humility. Next 
year the team will be hungrier 
and maybe luckier.
