Divestment Picking Up Steam in East 
By Andrew Greenburg 
Special to lht' Guardian 

PROVIDENCE, R.I. - After 
<J winter of virtual inacti"ity . 
rcccnt divestment action at 
evera l eastern universitie 

has revived interest in a 
'ensitive and controver ial 
issue - th 70le of academic 
institutions as investors in 
co mpanies operating in 
racia lly separatist South 
Africa . 

In the most significant sale to 
date. the trustees of Boston 
Univer ity last week voted to 

se ll a bout $7 million of the 
school' s $11.6 million ' South 
Africa-related holdings as a 
more dramatic means of 
exercising influence on 
corporations than through 
shareholder proxy resolutions. 

Columbia University had 
been the first institution to se ll 
its holding this spring. 
announcing in late March the 
dive tment of $2 .7 million 
worth of stocks in three banks 
accused of showing " indif-
ference" to South Africa' 
" prevailing repressive racial 

policie ." 
The impact of Co lumbi a 

President William McGill 's 
a nnouncement extended well 
beyond New York, however. 
While about 10 other college 
had previously dive ted to 
varying degrees, Columbia was 
the first Ivy League institution 
to opt for influence by sa le 
in lead of proxy . serving as a 
legitimizing precedent on other 
campuses . 

(McGi ll served as Chancellor 
of UCSD from 1968 to 1970. He 
re igned to take the presidency 

post at Columbia .) 
In April. the Corporation of 

Yale niver ity followed uit, 
expressing opposition to 
Morgan Guarantee Trust's 
practice of lending money to 
th~ South African government 
by selling nearly $1 million in 
stock in the bank's holding 
company. J .P. Morgan. 

The Yale Corporation' 
meeting further resulted in a 
tense confrontation between 
a bout 50 pro-divestiture 
tudents and trustees that led 

Yale President A. Ba rtlett 

Giamatti to lambaste the 
prote tors for what he termed 
" coercion" and physical 
restraints . " 

On April 25, Harvard 
undergra d\l ates linked the 
i sue of investment policy to 
discussion of the university's 
programs for minority students 
a nd 6,000 undergraduates 
boycotted classes in protest of 
the school's policy . 

Since then , the trustees of 
Brandeis University have sold 
a $350,000 Ford bond as a

By Heatherbell Fong 
Starr Writer 

California farmworkers and 
a non-profit agrarian reform 
organization have charged in a 
lawsuit to be heard today in 
Alumedu. Cu.. that 10 UC 
officia ls , including Presi-

In addition , the 49-page 
complaint filed by attorneys of 
Califo'rnia Rural Legal 
Assistance alleges the officials 
acted contrary to California 
state· conflict of interest laws 
because of their financial 
interest in large agricultural 
corporations or rural real 
estate. 

The suit is directed against 
the University of California. the 
UC Board of Regents and 
individual members of the 
Board, giving as an example

Calling the uni.verslty area 
"the most desired property in 
the country," city politicians, 
as well as Chancellor McElroy, 
say that the chance of having 
low cost housing near UCSD Is 
nil. 

Even the rental rates of the 
"student housing" to be built in 
the May Stores development ofC 
oC La Jolla Village Drive are 
estimated at $350-500 a month . 

"The only person who can 
aCCord (to provide low cost 
housin, Cor students) is the 
university." commented Ro,er 
Hed,ecock. who represents the 
Third District. which includes 
UCSD, on the Board of 
Supervisors. 

At present. UCSD is only able 
to pro\'ide one-third oC the 
Illudent population (approxi-

mately 3000) with on-campus 
housing, according to Campus 
Housing Director Gloria 
Spencer. 

Upon comJ;letion, the Third 
and Warren College apart-
ments will house 600 students, 
which. in the view of McElroy. 
will " more than enough 
aceommodate the need." 

A $50 increase in on-campus 
housing rates will be imposed 
next Call to pay for the 
mortgage on the new apart-
ments, according to Larry 
Barrett, director of Housing 
and Food Services. 

McElroy ~id the university 
is not planning to build 
additional on-campus housing 
at this time. 

According to Spencer, many 
students prefer to live off 
campus because oC the "noise 
fuetor (in campus housing) . " 

Spencer said that most oC the 
orr-campus student population 
live in La Jolla, Del Mar and 
University City. In addition.

Budget Cut Now 
Only $1.3 Million 
$600,000 Relief Funds Found 

By Reed Alpert 
Editor 

UCSD will suffer $1.3 million 
in budget cuts next year, rather 
than the $1.9 million originally 
tp rgeted by s.ystemw ide 
adminlsfrators. the Guardian 
has learned. 

This final figure i the result 
of a report put together by the 
Chancellor's Ad Hoc Commit-
tee on Budget Options, which 
drew together the budget cut 
recommendations from all 
UCSD vice chancellor . 

The vice chancellor are 
meeting today at 9 am with 
Chancellor McElroy to discu s 
the report and 'are expected to 
approve it with little or no 
changes. 

McElroy is expected to 
announce his final decisions 9Y 
May 15. 

Originally , in Oct. , 1978, 
UCSD had been targeted by 
systemwide administration for 
a $1.7 million cut, its share of 
the $20 million that was to be 
eliminated from the UC 
system. 

UCSD, however, planned for 
a $2 million cut. not notifying 

Spencer remarked that the 
apartments and condominiums 
immediately surrounding 
UCSD " don't rcnl·,to as many 
students as they use to because 
they don't like to have 
vacancies in June." 

Spencer commented that the 
out-of-state students "go into a 
state of shock" when they 
discover the housing costs 
around UCSD . "Most of them 
come to the housing office with 
the idea that they can get a 
place of their own, but they 
usually end up sharing," she 
said. 

Based on a Student Housing 
Survey taken winter quarter in 
1978, the average monthly 
rental rates within one mile 
from UCSD are as follows: 
Single students living alone -
$200: single students with one 
or two room mutes - $140: 
single students with three 
room mutes - $130: single 
students with four or more 
roommate - $118: and 

systemwide administration in 
Berkeley that it wa doing so. 
When ystemwide came back 
in Jan. of this year with an 
increased UCSD cut of $1.9 
milllQn, UCSD had a $100,000 
cushion left over, sources told 
the Guardian. 

5600,000 in Relief 
UCSD administration wa 

able to lower the $1.9 million 
figure to $1.3 million by 
acquiring $300,000 in relief 
funds from systemwide 
a dministration and another 
$300,000 from over-projected 
employee benefit funds, money 
that would have gone to the 
state later this year if UCSD 
had not reque ted that it be kept 
to aid in relief of the budget 
cuts , the sources said. 

The $1.4 million in targeted 
cuts ($1.3 million plus $100,000 
cushion) have been identified 
by the vice chancellors to be: 

- Administration/ main -
tenance/ provisions: $490,000. 

- School of Medicine : 
$260,000. 

-Genera l campus: $245,000. 
- Scripps Institution of

married students - $220. 
San Diego City Councilman 

Bill Mitchell remarked that 
most of the council members 
agree that the only way to bring 
in low cost housing around the 
university, as well as the rest of 
the city, is (or the landowners to 
lease the land at a low cost to a 
private developing firm. "This 
would a llow the developers to 
build (the housing) at a low cost 
and thus, rent for less," said 
Mitchell. 

Said Spencer, "You would 
think than if anyone was able to 
put in low cost Itousing, it would 
be a lurge corporation like May 
Stores." 

Hedgecock believes if North 
City West is ever developed, it 
will have an effect on the 
housing prices around UCSD. 
"The average price oC housing 
in North City West will be 
$150.000 ... thls will make 
existing housing prices (in the 
area) shoot up, .. remarked 
Hedgecock.

Capitalism Comes 
Back to ,China 
Wealthy Tourists Are Making 

Their Presence, Dollars Felt 
By Chris Mullin 

Paciric News Service 
BEIJING - In the lobby of the Beijing Hotel. a group of 

American tourists arc taking leave of their Chinese guide. As a 
token of their gratitude, they orrer a crisp new $100 bill . 

The guide declines . but the unabashed Americans add 
another $100. Still the guide! declines , though this time she 
hesitates slightly. . 

Another $100. The total now stands at around nine month ' 
salary for a guide with the Chi'na Travel Service. This time her 
refusal comes only ufter a long pause. The offer is withdrawn , 
but next lime s he may accept. ' 

The guide 's dilemma highlights a serious problem facing 
Chine e authorities as tourists and businessmen flock into 
Chini:l . With their expensive clothes, cameras and cash, they 
are awakening in the Chinese people aspiri:ltions that cannot 
possible be fulfilled . 

The result has been the re-emergence of some habits not seen 
in Chinese society for m <.l ny years . Evidence of bribery and 
prostitution - a lbeit on a very s mall COIle - are among the 
symptoms to have s urfaced within the last few month . 

Ten years ago only a hi:lndful of foreigners visited Chini:l. By 
1976 - when the Gang of Four fell - there were 30,000 tourists. 
This year there will be well over 100.000 lind their is tulk of half a 
million by 1985. 

To help pread the load, a lmo t all the mc.ljor cities of China 
have been opened to foreigners. Even suc h remote provinces as 
Sichuan, Xinjiang and Tibet - which have seen scarcely any 
foreigners in 30 yeurs - are now receiving their first trickly of . 
touri s t ~ 
(;hris Mullin, formerly employed by the BB(;, is a Hritish 
journalisl who now works for the political wL'ekly Tribune_ He 
has travelled extensively in Ihe Far East, including Vietnam. 
China, Cambodia :1"" J.:-IO!' . 

The difference between the lifesty le of the tourists and that of 
the Chinese who service them is stark. A night in the 17-story 
luxury Beijing Hotel costs the equivalent of more than one 
month's w,ages for the average Chinese. At · the moment , 
waiters and taxi <;Irivers stoutly refuse to accept tips. How long 
that will lust is anyone's guess . 

An American travel agent who had just clinched a deul to 
bring American tourists to Tibet next year told me he had 
offered the Chinese negotiators two cassette t<.lpe recorders . 
Last year. there would have been rejected with derision. This 
year they were accepted as " a welcome ~ift. ·" he said. 

The last few weeks have also brought the first reports of 
prostitution. Chinese girls are reliably reported to have sold 
themselves to African and Arab students in Beijing for about$6 
a trick . As a result , uuthorities in Beijing have clamped down on 
single girls ultending dances at the International Club and the 
Friendship Hotel. 

Prostitution was widely believed to have been eliminated in 
Chini.l . A Chinese source confirms, however . that it has ulways 
existed on a small scale, in Beijing at least. 

In the East Lake Park In the southern industrial city of 
Wuhan, gangs of youths wearing garish Western clothes and 
pluying guiturs have been seen in recent weeks dancing to 
something resembling pop music. Similar groups are starting 
to appear in other Chinese cities . 

Although there are ~igns that the Chinese authorities may be 
having sec~nd thoughts about plans for a big increase in foreign 
investment and technology, plans to exp,lOd tourism .Ire 
.. Iready well underway. 

Yet it is not China that is making a fortune out oflourism - irs 
the travel agents . Americi.ln trm'el agents get $1,000 and $500 
per persun per tour. a profit of around 30 percent on the cost of 
trips th'lt 1,lst less than three weeks. 

Of the rest , about om .... third goes on air fares (lnd stop (Ivers .

Campaign Runoff Statements 

Programming 
Terrell Chafin 

Entertainment programming at UCSD is too 
often aimed at a narrow segment of the student 
body. Many of us don' t benefit from the more 
than $10.000 spent by the ASUCSD for 
programming this year. AS Programming is 
inefficient, it doesn't meet the needs of the 
student body. We need programming for all 
students, notjustfora few. If elected, I will work 
for humanized and diversified programming. 

Currently, for example, Beer Bashes are 
dehumanizing. It's more like a cattle crowd than 
a party. More concerts are needed: especially 
noontime concerts, by the " hump," and 
coffeehouse programming featuring 11 wide 
variety of musical styles (e.g. Reggae. New 
Wave. Acoustic-Folk, Rock 'n Roll. and Jazz) : 
as well as an ASUCSD Film Series, etc .. .. 

I propose the establishmeht of a UCSO 
Programming Policy Board with membership 
including college reps. , the AS Programming 
Commission, representatives from student 
organizations, and the University Events 
OCfice. The increased communication such a 
board would create cannot help but improve 
UCSD programming at all levels. 

I h.Jve been endor cd bv the Groucho Marxist 
ClIUCUS, the Jazz Club, Chuck Bassett (Pop 
Event Chair , University Events) , Madeline 
Klutzten (Almost Anythi ng Goes chair) , Jon 
Bekken (Music Committee chair. niversity 
Events) . the Progressive Coalition, CSO 
Cillmshell , Barry Hyman (Commissioner of 
Student Welfare) , and the Classics Student 
Union. 

UCSO can have better programming. If 
elected I will work to expand and diversify 
quality programming for the benefit of all 
students. So. please vote Terrell Chafin for 
ASUCSO Commissioner of Programming. 

Mar~us O,rtega 
_ The nature of UCSO's emphasis on academics 

and little considenltion to extracurricular 
activities creates a lack of community and 
identity. Effective programming can mediate 
this I-lroblem. This can only be done by meeting 
the needs and wants of the students. Student 
authority. in deciding the direction, policy and 
I-lrocedure in programming with the 
administrative starr providing the technical and 
professionlll knowledge. is the ideal structure. 
This allows for p.-ogram selection that will most 
often coincide with student interests. Itl-lrovides 
continuity and expertise as well as innovation. 
and it allows the skills of the starr members to be 
widely utilized. 

The administration is currently controlling 75 
percent of all programming money . 
Administrative depletion of programming 
income, ranging from redistribution of vending 
machine money to unnecessary, high-paid 
administrators is a problem which ca n be 
remedied through restructuring lind strong 
tudent support. 
I am strongly in favor of the establishment of 

an amphitheatre. This will relieve the lack of 
facilities ne ded for large social. political and 
cultural events. A short-term solution to this 
problem would be the request by UE and 
ASUCSD for equal control of present campus 
facilities. With the opening of the pub this fall. 
funding should al 0 be sought for continuous 
entertaining events and acts . 

For the past two years I've initiated and 
coordinatelj numerous events. My experience 
with programming is extensive. As a Revelle 
Resident Advisor I've been in tune to student 
needs. [ a lso have been a member of the Student 
Organization for Alternative Production. With 
my experience and knowledge in programming, 
I feel I have a lot to offer to the student 
government and to the position of commissioner 
of programming.

Communications 
Steve Schreiner 

The importance of the 
Commu nications Commis-
sionel"s job should not be 
underestimated . Next year, 
UCSD media will have a budget 
of more than $30.000, funded 
entirely from student activity 
fee revenues. As chairperson of 
the Media Board. the com-
missioner is the most 
influential person with regard 
to allocation of the money 
lImongst seven campus media. 
The chair is also responsible for 
recommending the other 
(lIppointed) members of the 
board. lind i necessarily at the 
center of any controversy 
concerning media policy. 

Besides these traditional 
duties , all of which require 
media knowledge to be done 
well , the CommiSsioner of 
Communications should work 
on other projects that will not 

. just help the media survive. but 

enable them to improve. Past 
commissioners have not done 
this , but I intend to_ My 
priorities are: an advertising 
pool to supplement funding of 
a lternative media: readership 
surveys to give students a way 
to evaluate and criticize 
media: classes oUering 
academic credit for time-
consuming media involvement 
and experience: and appoint-
ment of Media Board reps who 
a re knowledgeable in media, 
rather than politics, so that 
intelligent media decisions and 
allocations can be made. 

I feel that my extensive 
media experience (3years) and 
proven ability to deal with the 
AS qualify me to be Com-
munications Commi¥sioner. 
Given the importance of the 
job, students should study the 
issues and vote carefully -
their money and media are at 
slake.

By Hea&herbell Fong 

&an Writer 
. Offering services to both 

UCSD students studying 
abroad and to visiting foreign 
students. UCSD'slnternational 
Center is, according to its 
director. a place of constant 
activity. 

Joan Walsh , dean of 
International Education. sees 
the center as a " referral 
agency" for foreign students 
" as soon as they ,et here" anda 
place for the processln,. advice 
and counseling of UCSD 
students wanting to study 
abroad. 

About 100 UCSD students are 
spendillJ this year in foreign 
universities through the 
Education Abroad Program. 
according to Walsh. Because of 
agreements between the 
University of California and 
certain universities in other 
countries, students can receive 
credit here for completion of a 
year of studies overseas , Walsh 
said. 

The program is open to 
juniors and seniors with a GPA 
or 3.00 or above. said Walsh. 
who added that applicants were 

the 

screened by her office before 
being accepted into the 
program. In addition, students 
should show an ability to adjust 
to a different way of life. should 
be proficient in the langua,e of 
the country of their choice and 
should be "well rounded." sa id 
Walsh . 

The Office of Interna tional 
Education at the International 
Center is equally concerned 
with visiting foreign students. 
according to Walsh . " It is 
here." she said. " that we must 
sign the Corm for him (the 
student) to be admitted to this 
country ." More than 100 
foreign undergraduates 
currently attend UCSD , 
representing 47 countries . 
according to Walsh. 

" Immigration and legal 
aspects are becoming more 
serious." Walsh remarked. and 
cited the unrest in Iran as one of 
the reasons for this . Under a 
student visa. students and their 
spouses may not legally find 
work in the US. 

"The Department of 
Immigration is paying more 
attention to so-called foreign

Radio Talk Show 
By Sam-Gooch 

The longevity of symphony 
conductors. intestinal bypass 
operations for the " morbidly 
obese" a nd fortifi ca tion of 
a lcohol with vitamin B-1 to 
prevent disea e in alcoholics 
are three examples of the 
va ried topics discussed on 
Here's To Your Health . a radio 
ta lk show coordinated by the 
UCSD School of Medicine. 

Most topics picked for the 
s how a ired on loca l station 
KFMB, are related to research, 
de velopme nt a nd onging 
progra ms connected with the 
UCSD School of Medicine and 
its sta fe. " We like to keep it 
within the Medical School , but. 
or course. depending on the 
topic. we occasionally go to 
outside sources." said Mary 
Mendez. from the Medi cal 
School' s Public Affairs Office. 

The ha lf-hour ta Ik show , 
hos te d by KFMS' s Don 
Brockma n and coordinated by 
Mendez. is a imed toward public 
aware ness. acco rding to 
Mendez . 

"What we t ry to do is make 
th e show informati ve. not 
technica l - informative in Lhe 
se nse of community conscious-
ness. We wa nt people to know 
what Lhings a rc happening in 
medicine. such as new surgical 
techniqu e a nd resea r c h 
brea kthroughs. We want people 
to know thut helpi available." 
re ma rked Mendez. 

Brockman says. " The s tation 
gets plenLy of calls from 

lisLeners after the show. Many 
people, some among them 
doctors. a re interes ted in 
learning more about the topics. 
We aired a show recently on 
ma le impotence - we got more 
calls than you can believe." 

Because Here's To Your 
Health is pretaped every 
Thursday listeners must call in 
a fter the segments have been 
aired. 

The show is a spin-off from 8 
live KFMB show called Topir 
that last aired in 1973. Toplr 
was sponsored by the San Diego 
Medical Society and , because 
of .. minor disagreements on the 
s how s format , " KFMB 
decided to cha nge the program 
and seek new input sources , 
according to Brockman. UCSD 
was chosen as this new source. 

According to Mendez. a show 
ha s ne ve r bee n cancelled 
becuuse of controversiality. 
" The only time that a topic was 
deliberately re cheduled. " she 
says. " was two day before the 
. no smoking proposition' was to 
be voted on. The topic just 
happened to be on smoking and 
we thought it to be in better 
"Is te not to a ir the show that 
week." 

Mendez said . " many vital , 
relevant topics are planned for 
th e future . " Although no

the Office of International 
Education finds it must 
"monitor the stay" of foreign 
students and make sure they 
fulfill these legal obligations, 
Walsh said. 

Friends 
The Friends of the Inter-

national Center is an organi-
zation which grew out of a 
"nucleus of community women 
and faculty wives" at Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography 
about 15 years ago, according 
to Walsh. The Friends raised 
the money to build the 
International Center and now 
provides services for foreign 
students at UCSD, she said. 

The Host Family Program 
arranges for a local family to 
meet an incoming foreign 
student at the airport and take 
him into their home for the first 
two or three days of the 
student's visit. according to 
Walsh. 

For spouses of foreign 
students, the Friends' 
American English in Action 
program provides free tutoring 
in conversational English. This 
tutonDl takes place on a "one-
on-one basis," said Walsh , who 
believes it to be "one of the 
most successful things we do. " 

The Co-operative Nursery 
School at the International 
Center is a place where 
children of foreign students 
learn English quickly. 
according to Walsh . 

The monthly Newsletter of 
the Friends of the Internutional 
Center lists activities open to 
foreign visitors and Ameri-
cans. Activities include an 
Internutional Newcomers 
meeting , un Internutional 
Kitchen monthly luncheon .

the consumer. 

In response to the suit, the 
University oC California stated 
last month that because the 
com pIa i nt lac ked speci fic 
accusations " no deCendant can ' 
determine what it is that he is 
alleged to have done, when, and 
in what capacity." It maintains 
that the " inordinate" influence 
and special relationships 
alleged by CRLA to exist 
between UC and a "select 
group of agribusiness in-
terests" are " not terms with 
objective content cognizable in 
a court of law" - in effect, that 
they are " political conclu-
sions. " 

Albert Meye rhoff , CRLA 
attorney', claimed last week 
that the "politicizing" oWC, its 
"selling itself out to the 
corporate sector," was what 
made the question a politica l 
one. However, he udded , it is a 
legal question as well . in tha t 
the university has "violated th e 
conditions" upon which it was 
established , n a me ly , its 
administration as a " public 
trust" and its obligations as a 
"land grant institution." 

These conditions require that 
the universi ty conduct it s 
research to promote " th e 
ma intenance of maximum 
employment, the improvement 
of the rural home and rural life 
and ." the welfare of Lhe 
consumer," and that its affairs 
be " free from politi ca l 
influence," according to the 
oCCicial complaint. 

The Ca lifornia Farm Bureau 
Federation is one organiza tion

Unexpected Women's Win 
Draws Coach's Praise 

By Ka ren Hunter 
Sporls Editor 

It wa s .. CSD Day " on 
Mi ss ion Buy 1<J ' t SuLurday 
morning as the TriLon crew 
teams came up wiLh four fir t 
plac s a nd two seconds to win 
Lh e Fir s t Annu a l ity 
Cha mpionships aga inst San 
Diego Late . SD and the 
Mi ssion Bay Rowing As ocia-
tion. 

" It was our women who did 
the be t of all," prai ed a 
plea ed Jack Va llerga, crew 
coa h. The women enLered 
Lhree events, wi th the biggest 
surprisc or the day coming in 
the Novice Eight. 

The novice women rowed 
their way to a 3: 41 ha lf length 
vi ctory over Sa n Diego State in 
what Vallerga termed a 
"pleasant surprise ." 

"This wa the first time 
we 've beat tate ," explained 
Lhe coach . " It ' s a va t 
improvement over whut we' ve 
been doing." 

In the Mis ion Bay Crew 
Classic held one month ago, 
UCSD' women did not qualify 
for the finals, placing fifth in 
their prelimina ry heat. SDSU 's 
WOlllen troked to a third place 
in the qualifying heat , earning a 
lane lor the fina ls. It was these 
sa me two boats that met on 
Saturday. 

The Women 's Lightweight 
Eight a lso placed first , edging 
out the Mission Bay Rowing 
Association (MBRA) shell by 
four seconds. MBRA turned 
around to beat the Tritons' 
Open Eight by a length. 

Vallerga, chairma n of the 
regatta , feels that both the 
men's and women 's teams a re 
on an "upbeat" right now . 
" We've' got to be up because 
we 've goL u tough regatta 
coming up nex t weekend 
agai nst Long Beach, Santa 
Cruz, SLate and USD." 

Men's Results 
In m e n' s competition u 

restructured Freshmen Novice 
shell rowed unopposed to clock 
in at 6: 42 for 2,000 meters. 

" We used the ume nine guys 
bu t shuffled positions around. 
The combination ol rowing a t 
home ,lIld s itting in new 
positions helped us to do much 

bette r than we' ve been doing 
the past few weeks," the coach 
explain d. 

Vallerga broke up his Men ' 
LighLweight Eight into the Bow 
Four a nd SLern Four to 
compete as two e parate boats 
in the Men's Lightweight Four 
event. The SLern FOUl: rowed Lo 
a 7: 24 fir L place fini h, three 
lengths a heud of SDSU. The 
Bow Foul' finished econd in 
7 : 30. 

In a s p cial " fun" event, the 
Men' Single, Jim Holmes 
finished fourth for the TriLons 
and Greg Baker, fifth . 

National Try-Outs 
Holmes will be trying out for 

the Nationa l Crew Tea m in the 
li g htweigh t divi s ion a fter 
school lets out in June. "Jim 's 
the bes t we've got," com-
mented Vallerga. " His scores 
on certai n strength a nd 
endurance tesLs put him in 
contention for u spot on the 
teum. However, coming Crom 
a n 'unknown' school way out 
here on the west coast does not 
work in hi favor." Holmes, a 
junior, will be transferring to 
UC Berkeley in the fall. 

According to the coach, the 
field is narrowed (rom the 
seventy rowers that start out 
the week of truining camp to 15 
or 20 ufter the first round of 
tests. 

" Jim suffers from a lack of 
exposure. When you ' re trying 
to get on the national team you 
need to be known. He 's got the 
physical ability to do it." Even 
if he doesn 't make it this year, 
Jim's chances will be upped for 
next year because the national 
officials will have a face to 
associate with the name," 
Vallerga udded . The final 
national squad consists of nine 
rowe rs and ,I coxswain. 

Upcoming Events 
In two weeks both teams head 

for the Western Sprints, an all-
co m e r s r egattu a nd the 
Lra ditionul ~nd of the men's

looking a heud to the South-

Blars for Mr. Charlie. Tell Me 
How Lonl tbe Train's Been 
Gene, and Go Tell It On the

Thursday night in the 
UCSD Theatre in which he 
expressed himself on a number 
of topics. Baldwin, currently a 
Regents' Lecturer at UC 
Berkeley and brought to UCSD 
by the Drama Department. 
spoke to a capacity crowd of 
Black and White people in 
rather blunt and direct 
language about race relations 
in America. 

Appearing tired after his long 
trip from Northern California, 
Baldwin at one point asserted, 
rather cryptically. that

Black man exists only in the

White man does not truly know

like house-keeper, cook, share

"Black people on the other

face of the planet that know 
White people, the only one with 
the very real knowledge of the 
White race that can free the 
White man from his limited 
relationship to the world .... .. 

The pity of it all . Baldwin said 
finally , was that White people 
aren't aware of the oppressive 
fuclors oflheir own sklte. Black 
liberation goes beyond the 
liberation of Americu's Black 

population . he intimated 
throughout. It is the spreading 
of the knowledge that Black 
peo)Jle possess . a form of 
consciousness raising that'll 
set the entire world on the right 
truck . a process that'll 
eliminate the Black/White 
dichotomy und ullow people to 
relate to each other us human 
beings. fir t ahd foremost. 
" After all," said Baldwin, 
wrupping up the point. " White 
is u state of mind .... .. 

Similarily, Buldwin derided 
the mass media for the way it 
constricts the population's 
sense of itself and its sense of 
history. singling out television 
us the primary villain. 

" Television is ,m evil thing. " 
he said, gesturing effectively 
with wide open palms" .. . It is u 
system that systematically 

destruys our sellse of ourselves, 
our culture, our history , even 
our own memorie ... you can 
see it happening already ... lt is 
difficult to deal with young 
people who don ' t know who 
Malcom X was, orchildren who 
barely remember Murlin 
Luther King ... There is a gap in 
time. or age. und it is an 
incredible gap ...... 

The gup. Bald.win insi ted. is 
in no smull part due to the 
American population's willing-
ness to uccept cursory, shallow. 
a nd superficial accounts of 
their own reality. with virtually 
no perspective as to what was 
really the truth . 

Towards thr end of the 
session . Baldwin cast a grim 
visage for the Future of the 
American Empire.

Lou Reed: Apathetic Poet of the Sordid 
A double-bill I'd really like to see is Lou Reed and Milton Berle. They 'd 
rna kl! a perfect tea m : 
Berle opening up , with hi 
,Ii ry expansiveness, a thi n 
ve neer over horrendous 
insecurity, hiding behind his 
cigar a nd cheap transvestite 
humor when things get rough, 
then Reed, prairie-dog Lou in 
his la test incarnation, fondling 
and nashing his guitar, slathing 
on the layers of self-parody . 
twitc hing in anguish over the 
inc redibility of his exual 
po turing. 

Such a show would be quite 
interesting, but there remain 
'cve ral difference between 
Berle and Reed , the mo t 
evident being that Berleplain ly 
need the adulation of his 
audience, while Reed' current 
atti tude is sum med up 
perfectly by six words essential 
to any understanding of the 
Rocker ethos, "r just don't care 
(about you) at all. " 

To give them their due, the 
somnolent audience a t last 
Tuesday 's Reed concert at the 
Roxy Theatre were equally 
un comm itted . The most 
common a well as active 
re ponses I saw among the 
crowd were furtive glances 
ar ound the auditorium , 
q ue stioning, suspicious 
glances, as if the truth that they 
ha t! no idea what they were 
do ing there was finally 
dawning on their besotted , 
con ciotlsn sses . 

This (lack of) reaction was 
not at all surprising, for the 
bulk of Lou Reed's present-day 
fa ns are enchanted by the 
image which rose out of his 
Transformer/Rock and Roll 
Animal period, that oCthedrug-
addled hedonist, writhing al>9ut 
on the stage in some perverse 
trance: a symbol (}( dionysian 
transcendence. . 

What they wanted was a 
ei rcu , Alice Cooper or Rocky 
Horror Picture Show, a dream, 
an illusion of freedom and 

po~er. What they got were 
savage, incisive renditions of 
twelve songs spann.ing Reed 's 
career. 

Thc nucleus of the show was 
for med by four songs 'crom 
Reed' s best and most 
und rrated L.P. , Berlin, on 
wh ic h he explores the 
('on equences , the inevitable, 
sordid tragedy which results 
from really pursuing the 

lifeway he glorified with songs 
like " Heroin" and " Walk on the 
Wild Side." 

T hese songs stink of puke, of sweat and blood and 
semen. They reek with 

the breat h of the des-
perate souls for whom the 
idea of self-control and a 
normal life i nothing but a 
leering chimera, perpetually 
obscure amid a weller of 
regrets , self-la ceration and 
self-pity, as their impu'ses to 
the good gurgle down the sewer 
of time. 

What significance can such 
songs have for a group of " men 
and women " whose only 
worries are where the next 
vica rious thrill is co ming from, 
and the next line of cocaine ? 

Reed himself is not freeofthe . 
lifele s, limy film which clings 
to Middle Americans ' lives, 
)Jrotecli ng us from the agonies 
of s urvival. Despite his 
pretentions, he is not much 
different from his audience -
bored. uncertain , plagued by a 
vague, disquieting sense that 
his life will prove. in the end. 
devoid of meaning. It is, as he 
proved Tuesday night , his 
refusal to ignore this fact, a nd 
his relentless fury a t the cage 
he's in which puts him on the 
stage and the audience on the 
floor. 

Reed threw himself against 
the bars of this psychic cage 
Tuesday , su rrounding the 
afoJl! entioned nucleus with 
jagged versions " Sweet Jane" 
(the opener) . "Street Hassle" 
and "Rock and Roll ," a 
horrible rendition of "Waiting 
For My 'M an," an equally great 
two-step ''I'll Be Your Mirror," 
and three new songs, which are 
not even worth reviewing. 

The stand-out musicians 
were Martin Fogle on the reed 
instruments and Stuart 
Heinrich on lead guitar. Their 
riff-trading was a soulful 
contradiciton to third guitarist 
Charles Hammer's mindless 
note-dropping with his guitar 
synthesizer. Reed, himself a 
spectacularly dirty guitarist, 
proved his mettle during the 
ten-minute , dirge-like version 
of " You Keep Me Ha ngin' On," 
a most pointed encore song. 

Lou Reed holds firm a place 
among the best of the poets 
who . possibly by accident. 
discover that the twelve-bar 
blues are a far more viable 
form in which to express their

Hunter Explores Self 
Ian Hunter You're Never 
Alone WI&b A Schizophrenic 
(Chrysalis) 

I an Hunter, the British Mott who sprang from the head of David Bowie, 
has a new album out. 
Continuing with the direction 
that he began on All-American 
Alien Boy, Hunter has draped 
heartCelt rocker lyrics about 
the sacred blues-rock progres-
sion, souping it up with the 
descending chromatic piano 
scales we Cirst saw· on .. All the 
Way From Memphis." Hunter 
has always been a foremost 
explorer oC his star-struck 
mentality/persona: he doesn't 
let us down here. His words 
express a deep metaphysical 

conviction : and an equally 
proCound belief in the power 
and viability of Rock and Roll. 
The latter belief is well 
communicated with the Clid of 
New York ' Finest: Bruce 
Springsteen's E-Street Band, 
John Cale and fellow-
expatriate Mick Ronson (of 
Bowie' Spiders From Mars). 
This band is powerfully 
eclectic, driving through 
streamlines EastCoast rockers 
Wild East and Cleveland 
Rocks, switching easily to 
patented Hunter ballads. and 
pulling oec the best non-
concession to disco since the 
Stones ' "Miss You. " John 
Cale's piano is as wild as ever. 
from stylize'd barroom tinkle to 

Beethoven arpeggios: all the 
instrumentation is excellent. 
arguably the best to be had in 
the genre. Hunter's fortunately 
controlled maunderings about 
his lost dreClms are et against 
a meticulously produced w,1l1 01' 
punctuated noise. It 's a good 
album and a st range one, one 
which would be banal if its 
"influences" weren't so nicely 
and quixotically orchestrated. 

Lowell George - Thanks ('II 
Eat it Here (Warner Bros. ) 

Lowell George has from the 
beginning shown a remarkable 
grasp of the musical form he 
has chosen to explore - super-
funky R&B/Gospel - and his 
band. Little Feat belts out 

better steamy southern rock 
than Clny other from, er, L .A . 
Here he upholds the tradition on 
songs like " Honest Man" <lnd 
" E<lsy Money," pushing fot' the 
limit of syncopation. With the 
help of Featel's Bill Payne 
(keyboards) and Chuck Rainy 
(drum) and just about every 
great ession drummer L .A . 
has to offer, and his own 
hyperdrive slide guitar, George 
elevate. compositions like 
"Two Trains" <l nd " Himmler's 
Ring" to cookers worthy of the 
Feal. ] like George best when 
he drops all pretense of 
seriousness and plays with his 
ge nres . Two songs here , 
" Himmler's Ring " and "Cheek 
to Cheek" (a tongue-in-cheek 
visit to Rosarito B.C.) are 
hilarious parodies. However. 
there 's one thing which almo t 
ruins all the instrumentClI 
excellence of this disk: George 
seems to be covering up a non-
existent compositional weak-

In Eas'tern Universities As minority students complain of dissatisfacti'on in dealing Nith university administrations, rallies. cia s boycotts. and 
other means of protest have created an atmosphere of racial 
tension on several east coast campuses. Different South African Investment Policies Clash Following several weeks of growing discontent and anxiety in MLirch. the appearance of two students in stereotypical Indian

which led the Hanover. N.H. school to close for a day of

demonstration of disapproval 
of the automotive company's 
dealings with agencies of the 
South African republic, a

protests have induced Amherst 
President John W <lrd to pledge 
evaluation of th<lt college's 
investment portfolio on a case

Here at Brown. the 
preference of the Corporation 
and its advisory panel for the 
convention posture of respon-
sible stockholders has been 
radically disrupted by the 
formation of a second group, 
comprising students. f<lculty . 
alumni. which has recom· 
mended support of several 
corporate proxies condemning 

business dealings with the 
Republic, its police, or military
