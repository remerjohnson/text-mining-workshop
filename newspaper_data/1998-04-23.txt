Haedel used his imagination to lit

Darwin. 

Behe also noted that on Sept. IS, 
in Science magazine. Eli zaheth 
Permisi claimed that Haeckel's 
research was the greatest hoax to 
the scientific wmmunity of all

a century until research and reeval-

emhryos. when in reality, the 
emhryos were not that similar at all . 

Ultimately for Behe, the answer 
to the origin of all species is the 
result of what he dt:ems "intelligent

Behe, to he the product of spon-

Tritons Have Strong Showing In Sacramento 
BEVY: At the California State Championships, UCSD challenged the likes of Cal and Stanford and still came home with victories 
By Key!n Mclaughlin 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The title sounds ill1pres~ive : the 
California State Championships 
(CSC). All the schools that 
row in California an: there. 
representing approximate-
ly two-thirds of' the (;fl!WS 
that row on the West 
Coast. 

However, III the crew 
tC;IIIlS of UCSD. attenti()n 
is rocused throughout the 
year on the seas!.n · s grand 
linale. the Pal:ilit: Coast Rowing 
Championships. Winning the CSC 

is not the primary goal. particularly 
when hig hoys such a~ UC Berke-
ky and Stanford arc there. ReganJ-
less. hoth the men 's and women's 

squads had eXl:ellent Olll -
ings last Saturday in 
SacramenlO. hringing 
home a hcvy of medal~ . 

The w()nll.:: n · ~ li ght -
weight crew leam hroughl 
horne silver medals in 
hoth the eight - and four-

~cal hoat~ . Four women -
veteran Kalie Fullerton 

and sophomores Jill Costa. Laura 
Neurater and Pennie Riley - raced 

in hoth raCl!S over the weekend to 
amass a Mr. T-like set of trophies 
around their m:cks . Racing all-out 
in om: evenl i~ hard enough; two is 
extremely demanding. 

"Thosl! four ladie~ had an inter-
esting afternoon." Head Coach Jack 
Vallerga said . "They had to race 
real hard. rehydrate ... LOlli down. 
think ahilut the four ... and then con-
centrate on the eight." 

The UCSD varsity eight hoa!. 
racing in the open weight dass, 
also excelled. The ladies finished 
fourth in the preliminary heats . 
tjualifying for the petit final in 

which UCSD's women wore down 
Loyola Marymount and Humboldt 
State late in the race to l!arn their 
fourth -place linish. 

Since Title IX passed, Icgislat-
ing equity of funding in women 's 
and l11en 's collcgiate sports , many 
wOl11cn's crew teams have rcceived 
a great increase in funding , espe-
cially in Division I prugrams. Thus 
it was not an even playing field for 
the women. and the fourth -place 
linish in the petit (or second-tier 
final) is very respc\:l;lhle . 

While th'e womcn arc an 
NCAA-accredited team. they still 

cannot be given scholarships. Addi -
tionally, in the lightweight division , 
all teams are approximately the 
same weight. ,reating a fai rJy even 
playing field. while in the open 
division, scholarship-type talent is 
apparent. 

The novice women 's boats also 
faced stilT competition. The A and 
B eight-seat boats linished fourth 
and fifth in their heats, while the 
novice four-seater qualified for the 
final and fini shed fifth out of 21 
teams.

ing extremely well. 

The conv.:rsions also came from 
a scoring regular. as Andy "Wilma" 
Wilga put UCSD ahl!ad with a 
wmfnrtahk 20-3 lead. 

That was how the lirst half 
ended. and while UCSD dominated 
Ihe action in the first stanza. the 
second half would hring IllLu.: h 
more competitive action. 

Things were a lillie tighter as 
Oc.:cidl!ntalmusded up a hit. UCSD 
still managed to get a hrilliant div-
ing try from Wilga. howev.:r. 

After ahout 20 minutes of play 
that can hcst he dl!sc.:rihed as. "chip-

WOMEN'S 
LACROSSE 

It ' ~ April Madness for the 
UCSD women ' ~ lacrllsse ~qLlad a~ 
it haltle~ for a scat at the Final Four 
tahk. 

The ladies have had a great sea-
son thus far. hut a ~plit last week-
end has put sOllle pressun: nn the 
team . 

Last Sunday. UCSD travekd to 
Bruin country I(lr a match with 
UCLA. The odds were stacked 
against the cn:w from La Jolla ; it 
managed a grueling 12- 10 victory 
Ihe day hcfnre al home against a 

lOugh. phy~ical tcam from Chlre-
mont College. 

The stid.-wieldcrs got goals 
from Chris Moll. Angelique Bon-
ner, Jen Silhavy and Jen Mosely, 
taking them one step closer 10 their 
goal: the Final Foul'. 

Sunday's game forced UCSD to 
take a step hack. In addition 10 
heing exhausted from the Clare-
mont war. the heat in Los Angeles 
was unhcarahlc. 

Although the rankings had 
UCSD ahead of its husts. UCLA 
managed to pull off an overtime 
upse!. 15- 13. 

The loss was tough for the 
wOlllen sinc.: they dominated much 
of the game. They must now, how-
ever, look ahead to the weekend's 
pnl<:eedings. 

On Friday night, UCLA will 
come to La JollaJor a night game. 
UCSD is licking its chops at a 
chance for revl!nge. 

The women have to win that 
game and a hattie at UC Santa Bar-
hara on Sunday 10 ensure a place in 
the Final Four.

week helped. 

"She exposed us 10 what I call 
Ihe 'guy machines: and I' m not 
afraid of using Ihose any more. I 
gOI a different view of working oul 
becau),e I was told what muscle 
groups I was working instead of 
hlindly using the machines."
