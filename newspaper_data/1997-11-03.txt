Thursday morning to protest 
the administration's removal 
of four sculptures from the 
university 's display of 'The

the pieces removeJ include 
"The Kiss" and "Samt John

University spokesman Lee 
Bartlett said the administra-
tion removed "The Ki s<;" 
because it contains nudity. 
"Nude males and females 
who are engaged in lovemak-
ing represent a sacred and pri -
vate kind of expression," 
Bartlett said. "Saint John the 
Baptist Preaching" - a nude 
depiction of the prophet -
was also removed because 
BYU is affiliated with the 
Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter Day Saints and show-
ing the sculpture connicts 
with church standards of con-
duct.

Recovery Act curtails the effectiveness of the 
current Endangered Species Act by allowing 
developers exemptions from protecting the 
endangered species," said Gina Castro, a 
CalPIRG student organizer. 

CalPIRG members also encouraged students 
to support the Endangered Species Recovery 
Act (H.R. 2351) introduced by Rep. George 
Miller (D-Martinez) which incorporates tax 
incentives for landowners - such as estate tax 
deferrals, tax credits, and tax deductions -
whose land is enrolled in the "Endangered 
Species Conservation Agreements ." 

The bill would allow small landowners, who 
have a minimal impact on endangered species, 
to benefit from a quick and easy permit process 
and to receive planning assurances. It also 
would require federal agencies to help plan for 
species recovery and then implement those 
plans within their jurisdictions. 

If enacted, Miller's bill would also promote 
species recovery by implementing recommen-
dations from the National Academy of Science, 
improving how important endangered species 
decisions are made.

Dr. Benjamin W. Zweifach, Renowned Bioengineer, Dies 
By Sara Snyder 
Staff Writer 

Benjamin W. Zweifach, UCSD 
professor emeritus and ground-
breaking researcher in the tield of 
bioengineering, died on Thurs., 
Oct. 23 due to complications fol-
lowing heart surgery. He was 86. 

"He was a towering figure in 
terms of medical research," said 
Geert Schmid-Schoenbein, a 
UCSD professor of bioengineering 
and colleague ofZweifach. "I can't 
understate his impact. He had one 

of the most amazing research 
careers of this century." 

Schmid-Schoenbein said 
Zweifach worked literally up to the 
last day before he went in for surgery. 

"He was a steady worker, biting 
into a problem and not lelling go," 
said Burt Fung, UCSD professor of 
bioengineering and longtime col-
league of Zweifach. "As a scientist 
he was one of the most persistent, 
the kind of persoll who really 
makes a field advance." 

Zweifach helped to establish 

UCSD's bioengineering depart-
ment when he came to the unlver~i ­
ty in 1966. Today, UCSD's bio-
engineering department is ranked 
as one of the top such programs in 
the United States. In u.s. News and 
World Report' s 1998 rankings, 
UCSD was fourth for biomedical 
engineering. 

Before joining the faculty at 
UCSD, Zweifach enjoyed a suc-
cessful career in physiology and 
pathology. He won the Claude 
Bernard Medal in physiololY. one 

of the highest honors in the tiel~ . 
During World War U, Zweifach 

published important research on 
shock and its effects on animal 
physiology. 

When he took a sabbatica l from 
Cal Tech in 1964, his career took a 
major hift that led him to the ~tudy 
of bioengineering, to which he 
devoted the rest of his life. 

"When he went to Cal Tech, he 
hung out with the engineers, instead 
of the biologists," said Fung, who

Muir College Celebrates 18th 
Annual Pumpkin Drop Friday 
EVENT: Paco weighed 
300 pounds and was 
filled with candy 
By Christine Velarde 
Guardian Ref)orler 

Students from all over campus 
gathered in thc Muir College quad 
to witness the 18th annual 
Halloween pumpkin drop last 
Friday. Coordinated by the Muir 
Residenls Council, the pumpkin 
drop and Halloween carnival was a 
great succcs~. 

The pumpkin, nicknamed Paeo, 
weighed 300 pounds and was IiIled 
with 100 pounds of candy. The 
Muir Rcsidents Council and some 
of the Muir housing staff carted the 
pumpkin to the Illh floor of Tioga 
Hall and dropped it off Muir 
Resident Dean Pat Danylyshyn-
Adams' apartment balcony. The 
side of Tioga Hall was covered in 
protective tarps, and all bicycles 
were removed as a precaution. 

"It was one of the most perfect 
pumpkin drops in my 20 years 
here," Danylyshyn-Adams said. "It 
went like clock work." 

Dan Brimm of Bailey Creek 
Ridge in Julian. Calif. . provided the 
pumpkin. 

Muir freshman Dawn Love said 
she was eaplivated by the drop. 

" It was one of Ihe weirdest 
things I've ever seen," Love said. 
" It was really nice 10 have a break 
during midterms 10 sec something 
so bizarre. II was so uneducation-
al." 

The camival itself was coordi-
nated by the Muir Residents 
Council. Muir freshman Kristen 
Withers, who helped serve cotton 
candy, said she had a great timc 
working at the carnival. 

"I have sugar on my anns and in 
my hair. bUI it 's becn so much fun." 
Withers said.

A closer inspection of the political concept known as ((One world, one nation" 
shows that the ideals of a utopian state conflict with belligerent human nature 

By Tommy Vu 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

o wonder' How many goodly creatures 
are there here ? How beauteous mankind is! 
o brave new world, that has such people in 
it! 

Young, naive Miranda spoke these 
immonal words in William Shakespeare's 
final play, The Tempest. In her innocence 

and brashness, Miranda sees the new 
life she is about to enter as a beauti-

ful, marvelous and 
joyful one. Brave, in 

thi s context. means 
splendid and gorgeously 

adorned . 
Aldous Hu )(. ley took 

this concept of a splendid. 
united. go rgeously 
adorned and perrect world 

and spun it into a frighteningly reali stic 
novel aptly titled Brave New World. In thi s 
book, Huxley introduces us to a new Eanh, 
one that is united under the same laws and 
government. Everyone here li ves in peace 
and harmony (there is no racism and sex-
ism. no pai n nor sorrow ); utopia on the sur-
face . 

As we read deeper into the book, howev-
er, we begin to understand that this world 
barely deserves to be called a utopia. The 
manipulative government uses sex and 
drugs to control and herd people. Genetic 
engineering breeds perfect humans. 
Individual thinking is suppressed for certain 
classes of people. 

The simple pleasures of reading or 
smelling flowers are prohibited for 

many. Those that do not conform to 
the collective, the savages, are cast 
aside to a barren wasteland to prac-
tice their pagan beliefs. Personal 

freedom, choice and intelligence 

are forbidden in this future utopia that 
Huxley creates. 

The concept of "one world, one nation" 
is not a new one - it is the idea of one uni -
fied govemment representing all people on 
this planet. Everyone is equal in every way 
- no one is judged by sex, race, ethnicity 
nor class. No one starves, no one suffers. It 
resembles other constructed Marxist soci-
eties and preaches concepts of communism 
and socialism. 

Everyone wants to live in a world with-
out crime and war, but what price must we 
pay to li ve in paradise'] Is thi s ideal even 
possible to allain? 

To live in a successfully utopi an state. 
people must forfeit their individuality and 
their various ethnici ties. We must shed off 
our multicultural exoskeleton and embrace a 
new, united culture. We would be subject to 
the loss of freedom. choice and religion. 
Everything must be unilied . There could be 
no stray thoughts - everyone must work 
for a single goal and purpose. 

Supposing anyone was actually interest-
ed in participating and living in such a 
mono-ethnic, mono-cultural society, is it an 
attainable goal? Like communism, the idea 
has some theoretical potential - no class, 
no segregation and everyone receives his 
equal share. And like communism, if we get 
down to the nilly-gritty. we can see that it 
only looks good on paper. 

Human nature is the reason this could 
never happen. As proved many times before, 
our petty differences - rooted in culture, 
ethics, language and religion - will drive 
us apart. Take, for example, Bosnia-
Herzegovina where Croats, Serbs and 
Muslims have slaughtered each other for 
hundreds of years . The most recent war, 
which ended only three years ago, cost

COMMENTARY: The university should switch the locations of the Undergraduate Library and the Science and Engineering 
Library, given that UCSD students rarely utilize the library specifically designed for their particular needs. 

UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY LOCATION NOT IDEAL

spacc. 

This causes undcrutili/atlon of 
UGL's re,crl'l.:s matenals . an e~sen­
tial learning tool. and. more gencr-
ally, is detrimental to UGL's 

i n ~ tructiona l mission. 
The university has recognized 

that the UGL l o~ati on is no longer 
suited to its functi on, and a long-
term plan extsts to move the UGL 
to a new building close to Geisel. 

the pan of campu, leadership. Is 
there a hellcr ~olu'ion '! 

It holds a ~o ll ection of texts 
suited for undergraduate research 
and study needs, and provides ser-
vices catering to undergraduates -
such as reference reserve material 
and the Playback Center. Term 
paper cl inics and other instruction-
al programs are also held at UGL. 

So if thc UGl is e pecially 
dcsigned for undergraduates. why 
isn't it located at Geisel, UCSD's 
central library building? 

Gei sel library is situated at the 
center of campus, much closer to 
the majority of classrooms, the 
Price Center, Library Walk and 
other areas where undergraduates 
tend to be. Geisel is also equidis-
tant from the various undergradu-
ate housing units. 

Shou ldn ' t undergraduate stu-
dents be the primary users and ben-
efic iaries of the central lihrary 'l 
Instead. the university concentrates 
the library resources it offers to 
undergraduates at Galbraith Hall. 

UGl has so much against it that 
it has been underutilized in recent 
yea rs. According to uni versi ty 
records, the metered gate count for 
UGL in 1983- 1984 was 860,000. 
That number dropped to 235,000 in 
1995-96. The usage of UGL 
decreased by a factor of 3.7, even 
though undergraduate enrollment 
increased by 40 percent. 

This is because undergraduates 
are increasingly using the Geisel 
library, and in particular the East 
Wing where the Science and 
Engineering (S&E) library is locat-
ed. 

To switch the 
location of the UGL 
and SAE libraries 
would provide 
substantial benefits 
to UCSD's 
undergraduates, 
re.earchers, and 
SAE library user •• 

However. this is contingent on 
obtaimng substantial funding and 
projected not to occur earli er than 
the year 20 10. 

Meanwhile, the campus is about 
to spend $11 million on a project to 
renovale Galbraith Hall , aimi ng 
primarily at improving the current 
UGL environmenl. 

However, the renovated facili -
ties wi II still be inferiorto Geisel's, 
and the inconvenient location of 
UGl will result in underutilization 
even after the renovation. 

There is. Move the UG L wllec-
tion and its ser\'ice~ to the Ea~t 
Wing of the Geise l Lihrary. where 
the S&E library is currently local -
cd; move the S&E library to 
Ga lbraith Hall ; and use pan of the 
$ 11 million to improve Geise l 
Lihrary 's East Wing for undergrad-
uate usc (e.g .. build sma ll rooms 
for group study) . 

While the Galbraith loca tion 
would sti ll be avai lable for under-
graduates. the UGl at Geisel 
would become the place of t;hoice 
for undergraduates to hath study 
and take advantage of the library 's 
instructional services. 

The S&E library, being a spe-
ciali zed collection, can naturally 
exist in a separate branch library 
rather than as part of a central 
library, just as the Biomedica l 
library exists in the School of 
Medicine area. In fact, the S&E 
library was a separate branch locat-
ed at Urey Hall until 1993. 

Geise l's facilities are more 
attractive than are those at 
Galbraith, offering excellent natur-

. It is apparent to anyone visiting 

UGl and Geisel's East Wing that 
undergraduates are overwhelming-
ly choosing the Geisel location, 
even though they are not offered 

Why is the campus undertaking 
such a major project of dubious 
utility? It is si mply due to bureau-
cratic inenia and a lack or vision on

Furthermore, most of the cur-

At Galbraith, the S&E library 
would be much closer to its science

biology departments. 

It would fit easily into the natur-
al -sciences cluster on campus 
which is being consolidated in that 
area with the construction of a new 
Natural Sciences Building.

Furthermore, the immediate

This would especially benefit

PASSING: 
Zweifach came to 
UCSD in 1966 
eo.tlllud ...... _e1 
was a professor of aeronautics there 
at the time. "His forward-looking 
alii tude was clear. To find new 
things [in biology 1 he knew that 
what was needed were new meth-
ods - engineering methods." 

Zweifach was a pioneer in the 
study of disease by focusing on 
microcirculation - blood now 
through the small blood vessels. 
He was a top investigator of the 
mechanical properties of blood 
vessels, the anatomy of vessels in 
different tissues and the now prop-

erties of blood in microves~els. 
Zweifach's genius wa.~ that he 

brought together physiologists, 
engineers and mathematicians and 
focused them all on the develop-
ment of new research techniques to 
study problems of microcirculation. 

Zweifach's discoveries are 
used today in the study of treat-
ments for diabetes, ischemia and 
inflammation. He was one of the 
first to emphasize the importance 
of the endothelium (blood vessel 
wall ) in health and disease, a sub-
ject that is gi ven worldwide atten-
tion today. 

His work is universally accept-
ed and is considered standard 
knowledge in medical textbooks. 

"He was internationally 

The UCSD Guardian 

known; people across the world 
admired him," Schmid-
Schocnbein said. "He has left a 
long-lasting imprint on UCSD." 

Zweifach belonged to many 
medical and engineering societies, 
and over hi s life received many 
awards in honor of his outstanding 
achievements. He was a founding 
member of the Microcirculation 
Society, and in 1972 he was 
awarded the E.M. Landis Award, 
the society's highest distinction. 
He also served as president of the 
Microcirculation Society in 1975. 

A memorial service will be held 
for Zweifach at UCSD on Fri .. Jan. 
9 at 2:30 p.m. For more informa-

The 
Editor's 
Soapbox 
Laura Knighten 
Former Copy Editor 
Greetings 
from Ireland 

Dia dllllil, UCSD. That is an 
Irish greeting, literally meaning 
"may God be with you." Four weeks 
after my departur\! from California 
- Ihe land of sunshine - I'm jusl 
staning to settle in. Ireland is every-
thing I expected, including green 
hi lis, friendly people. an abundance 
of Guinness and rain and morc. 

Unfortunately, I seem to be a bit 
of a disappomnnenr, as I've never 
lived the Beverly Hills 
90210IBaywatch lifestyles of per-
petual sunshine, perfect hair and sil-
icone breasts. My descriptions of 
the wonders of UCSD. such as the 
Sluart Art Collection's Big Red 
Shoe and the Talking Tree do meel , 
and even surpass, my friends ' 
expectations of crazy California. 

In preparation for my journey, I 
packed fairly well. I remembered 
warm clothes. a toothhrush and a 
waterproof backpack - what I 
thought were all of the essentials. 

Unfortunately, r left my English-
American dictionary at home. While 
we may appear to speak the same 
language, Ihere arc ~ome very 
important differences thai I' ve 
learned about the hard way. Don't. 
for example, ask for Ihe restroom; 
you' ll he sent to the nearest reSlau-
rant. 

My roommate Lily asked me one 
night. "Laura, what would you like 
for dinner?" 

Laura: I don't care. the on ly 
thing I don't like is /ucchini . 

Lily : What is zucchini'! 
Laura: It looks like a cucumber. 
Lily: LIke a courgCltc'! 
Laura: What's a courgeltc '? A 

zucchini looks like a cucumber, but 
tastes more Ii ke a Mjuash. 

Lily: What's a squash? 
Around and around we went. 

Lesson one: zucchini = courgelte. 
I've also learned new terms, such as 
knickers (underwear), prams 
(strollers) and Hoovers (vacuum 
cleaners). 

Beyond these superficial, albeit 
confusing, differences of speech lie 
more fundamental differences of 
culture. 

For example, the social scene in 
Ireland revolves around the pub. 
The Irish pub belongs to youth and 
adults alike. A typical evening out 
for a college student of any age 
would start with a few hours enjoy-
ing the craie (the fun) at a local pub, 
followed by dancing the rest of the 
night away in a nightclub. College 
societies often meet in one of the 
two pubs on campus; those who 
don't meet at the campus pubs 
adjourn to pubs off campus for 
social time after meetings. 

Drink exists as an imponant ele-
ment of the Irish culturc - not only 
for the social dimension of drink.ing, 
but as an employer and cultural 
sponsor.

rHEPEOPLE'S CHOI~~ 
Cooperatives at UCSD augment students' options with 

various offerings and alternative structure 
For over 20 years the cooperati ves 

(co-ops) at UCSD have provided stu-
dents with a cheaper alternative to uni-
versity prices. 

Today, the Co-ops at UCSD are still 
a valuable resource, though many stu-
dents do not utilize them. People are 
either intimidated by the co-ops or 
simply don't know of their existence, 
according to Erica Wasinger, a former 
member of the Food Co-op. 

A co-op is an organization owned 
by and operated for the benefit of the 
individuals that use -its services. 
According to members, the co-ops at 
UCSD are not as much cooperatives, 
as they are collecti ves. 

"A collective is a non-hierarchical 
system in which people are working 
together to make sure the task the 
needs to get done is done," said Sharon 
Fawcett, a member of the Food Co-op. 
"It is sharing in the re'ponsihility. It is 
a common goal and it's a cooperalive 
effort to meet thai goal .. 

All of the co-ops at UCSD are non-

profit organizations . According to 
Wassinger, the money goes into keep-
ing the prices as low as possible. 

"What the co-ops are about is pro-
viding the best possible service, the 
best quality products, at the lowest 
price possible," Wasinger said. 

UCSD is currently the home of four 
co-ops - Groundwork Books, the 
Food Co-op, Che Cafe and the General 
Store Co-op. 

The first of the four co-ops to solid-
ify its place as an organization at 
UCSD is Groundwork Books. 
Groundwork Books staned in 1974 as 
a community center and collective 
bookstore in Solana Beach. It became 
a part of UCSD in the fall 1975 when 
it was offered a space in the newly 
built student center - now known as 
the Old Student Center. It started off as 
a group of individuals selling books 
from a small bookshelf. 

Over the years, Groundwork Books 
ha~ slowly emerged over the years a 
the leader of the co-op~. It i, the most 

financially stable and politically active 
of the four co-ops on campus. 

Although Groundwork Books is 
less politically involved than it has 
been in previous years, its members 
still adhere to policies on which 
Groundwork was built, according Jeff 
Corbell, a worker at Groundwork 
Books. 

"We work together rather than in a 
hierarchical situation," Corbett said. 
"Of course there's always going to be 
a knowledge hierarchy there, which 
we always try to deal with. The 
Groundwork purpose is to help people 
empower themselves to live within 
society." 

Things are run differently at 
Groundwork Books than at a typical 
store. Members have avoided estab-
lishing managerial positions, and 
choose instead to establish basic dulies 
for each employee. 

"Each of our members have rc,id-
ual respon,ilJilltic, ," said Nicole

as a result of the competition, 
Because of this direct competition I 
with the administration, Sankary 
said he was not allowed into the 

i 

newly-built student center in the '-________________________ ..1 

fall of 1975. After being moved 
several times, Sankary was finall y 
offered a space which is now 
known as the Food Co-op in the 
student center. 

Today, the Food Co-op is locat-
ed next to the UCSD Bike Shop in 
what is now known as the Old 
Student Center. 

Since the beginning of the Food 
Co-op, various ideals have helped 
to shape the business, Volunteers 
and core members work together 
and imbue their enthusiasm for the 
ideals of the co-ops through collec-
tive effort. 

"Because we have no boss, I 
think there 's a lot more spirit. 
People are proud to work there, and 
people really want the store to look 
good - and they put 100 percent 
effort into it," Fawcett said. 

Food Co-op members pride 
themselves on the products sold at 
the Co-op, According to Fawcett , 
the Food Co-op will not sell any-
thing containing relined sugar, caf-
feine or meat. 

"A lot of student s really 
embrace the ideas of the co-op and 
shop there hecau se of what it 
stands for," Fawcett said. 

The Food Co-op offers many 
things most students don' t know 
about. 

"We sell bulk shampoo, bulk 
lotion, bulk everything so you can 
reuse the container time and time 
again," Fawcett said, "All of our 
bulk foods don't sell that well, but 
we put them there because it 's the 
principal of it. We're saying this is 
the way it should be done." 

The Food Co-op sells every-
thing from bagels and apple juice, 
to shampoo and lotion.

"A lot of students shop there 
because of what we offer," Fawcett 
said. 

To nail the MCAT, knowing the sciences isn't enough. You've got to know the test. 

Because of the alternative 
approach, some employees feel 
that students are often dismissive 
about the intentions of the Food 
Co-op. 

"They think we're going to 
throw ideas down their throat ," 
Therrell said. "There are other peo-
ple who say it's the best place on 
campus." 

Wasinger also said that the Food 
Co-op can be intimidating because 
"it's really busy and there's music 
playing,"

Food Co-op. Some think that 
everyone who works at the Food 
Co-op is a vegetarian or a hippie. 

"We're just a bunch of nonnal 
kids and what's cool about our 
store is the way that it 's run ." 
Therrell said. 

The Che Caf":. named after Che 
Guevara, a Latin Ameril.:an revolu-
tionary leader. was known as the 
Coffee Hut until students inherited 
the area in January 1980. 

Located down the hill from 
Galbraith Hall. the Che Cafe began 
as an advocate of the Food Co-op. 
The Che Cafe made ~andwiches 
and salads to be sold at thc Food 
Co-op. Later, it opened its doors to 
students during dinner, lunch and 
breakfast, as well as the perennial 
"AII-You-Can-Eat" on Wedne~day 
evenings. 

The Che Cafe is known for host-
ing bands. Oversoul, a local band, 
along with Grecn Day and Crash 
Worship, have played at the Che 
Cafe. 

Over the pa~ t several years. the 
Che Cafe has experienced a loss of 
business due to a series of bad pub-
licity. 

"People hear rumors that it's 
really dirty, a den of hippies," said 
Kristen Cates, a member of the Che 
Cafe. 

According to Cates, the Che 
Cafe is organized and clean. It 's a 
place for sllIdents to get nourish-
ment and enjoy themselves, Cates 
said. 

Al though the Che Cafe is 
changing its image. its workers sti ll 
adhere to its founding political 
views. 

"I see the Che 'Cafe a~ a place 
where you can throw out the Ideas 
of competit ion and profit and 
things that kind of get in the way of 
people working together towards 
something," Cates said. "The pur-
pose of a co-op is to practically and 
realistically challenge the dominant 
way of doing things and make it 
work . Jt \ also to question the way 
things arc nonnally in hierarchical. 
exp loitati ve, really profit-driven, 
really competiti ve society." 

The General Store Co-op began 
with a few students se lling Levi's 
jean and Coke from a small space 
next to the Grove Caffe, according 
to George Gonlalez, a member of 
the General Store Co-op. 

After ,uhsis\ing at this loca tion 
for ,ome time, the administra tion 
offered the General Store Co-op a 
larger space. In the fall of 1980. the 
General Store Co-op opened, offer-
i ng a variety of i tem~ to ~tudc nts. 

Today, the General Store Co-op 
is still located between the Food 
Co-op and KSDT in the Old 
Student Cent er. The store no longer 
se lh Levl ·s. but It does offer stu-
dents everything from postcards 
and blue books, to candy and T-

The UCSD Guardian 

shirts. 
At this time, the General Store 

Co-op competes directly with the 
university bookstore for business. 

"We will not sell anything if we 
cannot \c ll it cheaper than thc 
book tore," Gonzalez said. 

The store evcn competes with 
the bookstore by selling a wide 
range of textbooh at the beginning 
of each quaner. Most of the books 
sold arc for sc ience texts, but the 
Genera I Store Co-ops arc conti nu -
ally increaSing the number of class-
es fo r which it provides books. 

Although the General Store Co-
op is the on ly co-op that competes 
directly Wi th the university, it is the 
least puli tical of the four. 

"We take things as they come 
and dccide from there," Gon7_alez 
said. "I think we are one of the 

mo~t diver~c stores a~ far as where 
people fall in the political spec-
trum. We've had people that arc 
very liberal, very conservati ve and 
right in the middle. We don 't do our 
hiring based on political views. so 
what happens is we end up hcing a 
moderate store." 

Co-op~ once played a greater 
role on campus. In the past , there 
have heen severa l other co-ops. 

Previou~ co-ops include the 
Computer Co-op, the Rebel 
Bakers Co-op and Assorted Vinyl, 
a record co llective. 

The UCSD Bike Shop was 
once a co-op before the university 
took over the business. The recy-
cling program on campus was 

once called the Recycling Co-op. 
Another co-op, named the Farm 
Co-op, operated from the gardens 
behind the Che Cafe. 

The four co-ops on campus 
today have had struggles with the 
administration in the past. 
Al:Cording to Corbell . the relation-
ship between the co-ops and the 
administration has been tenuous at 
times. 

Members of the co-ops said that 
at one time, UCSD police broke 
Into the General Store Co-op after 
the members were late providing 
fi nancial infonnation to universi ty 
auditors. 

The co-ops and administration 
have had disputes about good bu~i­
ness practices. Both the administra-
tion and the co-op have fought over 
whether the university should have 
UI.:CCS ' to the co-ops' buildings. 

In 1993. because of previous 
problcms, the un i versity and co-
ops prepared a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU). This mem-
orandum provides an outline that 
the co-ops must follow in order to 
continue to be organiza ti ons at 
UCSD. Since the memorandum 
was effected, problems between the 
university and the co-ops have 
been minor. 

According to current co-op 
members. the administration still 
doesn ' tthink very highly of the Co-
ops. 

"They kind of look down on 
us," Fawcett said. "They're kind of 
condescending. They look at us as 

Monday, November 3, 1997 

'hippies.' It 's something totally dif-
ferent than what it was before when 
it staned and what the hippie revo-
lution was about. It's something so 
different." 

Now, the co-ops try not to con-
flict with the administration . 
Wasinger said. 

"It 's ridiculous," Wasinger said. 
"We don't need it, they don ' t need 
it. They don't like the fact that we 
are student-run and we control the 
store and everything about it. They 
want to control everything on cam-
pus." 

No maller what the relation 
hetween the Co-ops and adminis-
tration, things have been calm for 
the past couple of years. The co-
ops have become less politically 
active and focus more on business 

is~ues . 
The l:O-OpS are, and have always 

been, groups of dedicated students 
offe ring valuable alternatives. They 
offer these alternatives to all stu-
dents, regardless of political views. 

"Everyone is welcome and peo-
ple shouldn ' t feel intimidated, 
Wasinger said. "Because if you 
walk in and you wani to do some-
thing. you have an opinion to offer. 
it will be gladly accepted. That 's 
what we ' re all about, learning from 
each other and giving as much as 
we can."

What is your view on long-
distance relationships? 
Interviews by Jennie Chang 
Photography by Dave lubitz 

"I've seen one that's 
worked well, but pretty 
much for everyone, it's 
kind of difficult. I've never 
had to try to keep one up. 
I've realized it's not really 
worth the trouble ." 

Scett R. V .... 
Muir Senior 

"There has to be a lot of 
trust involved_ You have to 
learn that it has to be a 
mature relationship so the 
distance won't be a prob-
lem. If they are truly meant 
for each other, then they 
would be able to work out 
the difference and wait 
with patience_" 

Daniel Kim 
Warren Junior 

"It's hard, but if the per-
son is worth it, it could 
happen_ But it 's one you'd 
have to make an extra 
effort to try and spend time 
with one another." 

C ..... ln Petpraslt 
Revelle Senior 

"I don 't think they could 
last. From what I know, it's 
tough to keep. But] think it 
can be kept if it's true love, 
but if it's not, everything's 
going to fall through." 

Eric Scharf 
Marshall Senior 

"I don't have one and 
I'm glad. It takes compro-
mise. A couple of months 
could work out but not 
long distance for years and 
years_"

SOAPBOX: 
Ireland encourages 
educational freedom 
eon .... edtro. .... , 
for a week of parties and packed

and school issue invitations to fresh-
man (or "fresher.; ," as they are 
called here) to socialize and party. 
Drinking i expected, and this year's 
f reshers Ii ved up to all expectations. 

Additionally, Irish students enjoy 
a great deal of academic freedom 
Ihat America students don'\. Unlike 
Ihe quarterly academic sprint per-
formed by UCSD students, Ihe Irish 
syslem is more like a long di~lance 
jog. Instead of having a clear list of 
whal to read for which lecture and

FACE: 
Title IX paved the 
way for women 
ContInued frOlll ..... 10 

'"Title IX opened the door in so 
many ways," Sweet said. "II's fre-
quently jusl associated with athlelics 
because I believe thai's where some 
of Ihe greatest discri minat ion had 
taken place - but il was really 
intended to provide equal opportuni-
ty for males and females in all cdu-
calional areas . 

"In athletics, we've gone from 
major universities not having ath-
letic programs to those same uni -
versities now having very competi-
Ii ve, well -funded women's pro-
grams thai they arc proud of. II 's 
extremely rewarding for me 10 be 
at one of our events and hear some 
of our male athlele& observing 
female competitors. saying. 'she is 
a great athlete" Swecl said . 

UCSD was one of the firsl 
school. to comhine the men\ and 
womcn's alhlelic depanment~ . 

"I was one of the first women 10 
be appointed as athletic direclor for 
comhined men's and women's Jlro-
gram," Sweet ~aid. " roday, Ihcre <Ire 
jusl a handful of universities litat slill 
have separale men's and women', 
programs. The good new. is thai the 
number of women directing athletic 
programs has increased, but lhe nOl-
so-good news is that it's not increas-
ing as rapidly as il should be." 

and are left to find their own way. 
The beauty of this system is Ihat 

students can explore whatever 
dimensions interests lhem - the 
entire point of scholarship! 
However, as an outsider. such free-
dom overwhelms, as much as it 
excites me_ Where do I begin on this 
massive list? 

On a more personal note, I am 
for the firsl time in my life trying 10 
understand what it means to be 
American. I am now Ihe one that 
speaks sirangely and dresses eccen-
trically. I may blend in at times, but 
as soon as I open my mouth I 
become "the American." 

Yet. whal docs being 
"American" really mean '! I'm dis-
covering how unprepared I am to 
answer that qucslion. How do I 
explain "American" - a label so 
vasl Ihat it includes African 
Americans. Nalive Americans, 

On DMIlon II Athletics at UCSD 
Last spring. in a general referen-

dum question, 87 percent of Ihe 
UCSD student community voted for 
a move from the current Division m 
athletic standing to Division n. 

"We have been very busy Irying 
10 identify whal sleps need to be 
taken in order to make Ihal happen," 
Sweel said. "Wc're working wilh Ihe 
administration. We have the com-
mon goal of moving to Division n in 
the year 2000. 

One' of the greatest benefits of 
making the move is panicipating 
with sehools lhat are more like us. 
rather than Division III wherc 90 
percent of the memberships are 
small. private inslilutions wilh 
enrollments of less than 1500. The 
other major benefit would be having 
the opportunity to join a confer-
ence ... and that wi II generate a new 
kind of excitement." 

Some have argued that thi s move 
would take away from UCSD's high 
academiC repulallon and conse-
quently strides toward a higher ath-
lelic standing have been slow in 
recent year~ . The largest improve-
menl has been the addition of 
R1MAC - and even Ihal was Ihe 
result of <I tough fight. Strict acade-
01 ic standards, underpaid coaches 
and poor recruitmenl due 10 Division 
U\ tanding have hurt the athletic 
department, but UCSD squads have 
persevered - winning 22 national 
championships since 198 I. 

"I think that Ihere arc a number of

me from my British and Irish room-

As I ask these questions I realize

America, Ireland and its people are 
much more lhan green hills, friend-

find a beller understanding of what 
it means 10 be American.

at our place." 

With neither team playing clean 
volleyball , UCSD was able to work 
through its kinks thanks to the ste l-
lar work of junior outside hitter 
Dana Salter. As the Triton offense 
struggled to establish its presence, 
Salter took over the role of the go-
to hitter. 

"Dana was really the corner-
stone of the team and the match," 
McFarland said. "She really carried 
us through so me rough SpOIS." 

Lcd by the swings of Salter and 
fe llow junior Katherine Brynjestad, 
UCSD managed to keep the first 
game close before pulling together 
a pair of clutch points to win the 
game, 17-15. 

Switching sides of the court 
proved to he unkind to Ihe Tritons 
as they continued their inconsistent 
play. Neither the swings of Salter 
nor the dump kills of senior setter 
Sherine Ebadi could save UCSD as 
it dropped the second game, 15-6.

with a revived offensive attack and 
renewed confidence. Salter and 
Brynjestad continued to handle the 
majority of the swing for UCSD 
and the Leopards found themselves 
with no answer, as the Tritons took 
the third game, 15 -7. 

" Fi nall y. in game three, we 
started passing again , our serve got 
better and we started to steady out ," 
McFarland sa id. 

Riding the momentum of the 
third game, UCSD continued to 
apply pressure in the fourth and La 
Verne proved to he no match as the 
Tritons closed the door, 15·8. 

Despite recording thei r 16th win 
in a row, entering the record books 
and remai ning undefeated against 
Division III opponents, McFarland 
and the players arc staying focused 
on bigger goals. 

"We haven' t been keeping trdck 
1of the winsl and we've haven' t 
been talking about it too much ," 
McFarland said. "We've been try-
ing to focus on one match at a time 
and let any records take care of 
themselves. We're more concerned 
wi th looking toward playoffs and 
trying to get ourselves back to the 
top of our game." 

The Tritons will have an oppor-
tunity to take sole ownership of the 
record for consecutive wi ns on 
Wednesday as they baltle agai nst 
rival Cal Lutheran at RIMAC.

Tritons Get Jacked By Trojans 
USC: The Tritons traveled to Los Angeles to take on the No.2-ranked 
Trojans last Saturday with upset hopes, but lost 14-5 in a tough match 
By JoMh NIHnIOII 
Co-Associate Swrts Editor 

When one thinks of a Trojan. 
one initially thinks of a condom, of 
which the most important quality i, 

its ability to ,tay 
strong and not to 
break. Of cou rse, 
a sports fan I11l ght 
initially think of 
the Trojan> of the 
Uni vers it y 01 
South ern 
California who. 
like their proph)'· 

lactic counterparts, stood ~trong on 
Saturda) , withstanding the charge 
that the UCSD men', water poln 
mounted against them on Saturda\ .

McDonald \ Swim Stadium. 

UCSD allowed an carly two-
point goal after USC won the open-
i ng sprinl. Simun Cllnerman, the 
Trojans' ~enior driver from Croatia, 

received the pass after the sprint 
and promplly put Ihe USC up 2-0 
barely a minute into the game. 

"We came out really slow 
against them." senior goalie Pat 
Beemer said. "They scored a two· 
pointer on their first possession 
which happened in our last game 
against SanLa Clara Uni versit) . We 
were lucky enough to comc back 
against Santa Clara. but once YOLI 
give the~e USC guy~ a chance, th!.:) 
will just bury you - and the} did." 

The early Trojan goal ~ent the 
Tri ton;. gasping for air. Th..: Triton, 
had to play catch-up for the rc~t ot 
the game, a posHlon they did not 
take to with a ~mile. 

"We wcre 20 second into the 
game and It wa~ alreaJ) 2-0 with

So I drove up north fo r Ihe 
game, fl ashed the all -powerful 
Guardiall pre!>s pass and I was 
instantly in VIP scaling. I gave 
Eddie DeBartolo a quick shout 
out and I was on my way. 

With my intimale knowledge 
of the layout of the 'Slick, my 
plan unfo lded smoothly. 
Making my way to the locker 
room, I snagged one of those 
helmets with a tinted visor, stole 
some pads, donned the afore-
mentioned jersey and made for 
the sidelines. 

I explained to security that 
I'd been bauling the flu , and I 
had just dropped the kids off at 
the pool , if you know what I 
mean. I asked if they had 
already kicked of f, and he told 
me we were down 7-0 in the 
second quarter. "Dang," I said. 
"Time nies when you've got a

I told them that it 's important

stand in my way because with 
all the socks and sweatpants I 
had stuffed in my uniform, I 
looked like I was heading for the 
World's Strongest Man contest. 

I nearly got trampled as I 
made it to the field since the 
players were all coming back 
for halftime. I'm the type that 
would be late for their own 
funeral, and today was almost 
the day as Dana Stubble field 
clocked me on the way up the 
tunnel. 

"Good form Dana," I ye lled . 
"Give 'em heck !" 

Though the plan was still 
going well , I was now a lillie 
nervous with all my heroes 
around me and this time I really 
did have to see a man about a 
horse. With my nerves calmed a 
bit. I entered the tunnel to find

The Tritons got it. They played

Volleyball Keeps Rollin' Tritons Host Postseason 
Soccer Bash 

Sixteen: "The Streak" continues as the Tritons defeated La Verne 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

One would think that after win-
ning 15 matches in a row, the 
UCSD women 's volleyball team 
would have assured 
itselfs a place in the 
school record books. The 
Triton volleyball program 
has a long and storied 
history, though, that 
includes five National 
Championship banners, 
numerous all -Americans 
and high ex pectations
