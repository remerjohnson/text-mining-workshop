The University of California 
debuted a $5 million initiative to 
improve health care on Monday,  
Oct. 25. 

This new Center for Health Quality 
and Innovation will support the UC 
health campuses, which includes the 
UC system’s five academic medical 
centers, 10 hospitals and 16 health 
professional schools. 

Initial funding comes from the five 
UC medical centers — at UC Davis, 
UC Irvine, UCSD, UCLA and UC 
Berkeley — that will each donate $1 
million. These funds are generated 
by the California Hospital Fee 
Program,. The program imposes a fee 
on California hospitals to supplement 
Medi-Cal payments, direct grants to 
hospitals and support coverage for 
children.

The center is intended to 
complement rather than compete with 
existing health care projects, such as 
UCSD’s “San Diego Safety Net Health 
Information Exchange” project, which 
allows physicians to make follow-up 
appointments for patients who do not 
have a physician. It cited as one of the 
individual campus projects that will be 
integrated into the center.

“This new center is in perfect 
alignment with our vision for [the] 
UC San Diego Health system as one of 
the most innovative health systems in 
the world,” UCSD Health System CEO 
Tom Jackiewicz said. 

The center will be led by an 
executive director and a board 
consisting of the six UC medical 
school deans, five UC medical center 
CEOs and UC Senior Vice President 
for Health Services John Stobo.

Thirty-four years after American 
Indian bones were first found under 
UCSD, two years after a panel 
concluded that the bones should 
not be returned and one year after 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox pledged 
to continue working on repatriation, 
the university is working with local 
tribes to return the bones.

The 29 bones — which, at 10,000 
years old, are some of the oldest ever 

found in the Western Hemisphere 
—  belong to the Kumeyaay tribe, 
and were first discovered by Cal State 
Northridge archeologists in 1976. 
According to the Native-American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act of 1990, all institutions that 
receive federal funding must return 
American Indian cultural artifacts 
and human remains when a tribe can 
prove “cultural affiliation.”

San Diego police are investigating 
the case of a woman’s body found inside 
a burning SUV last Friday, Oct. 29. �e 
vehicle was parked in the P701 lot next 
to the UCSD baseball �eld on Voigt 
Drive, east of the I-5 freeway.

According to San Diego Police Lt. 
Kevin Rooney, several people made 
9-1-1 calls around 9:20 p.m. to report 
the burning vehicle.

Fire�ghters put out the �re and 
found a body of the woman inside. 
Helicopters were used to search for 
possible suspects and evidence in the 
surrounding area. As a result of the in-
vestigation, the parking lot was blocked 
o� and individuals who parked their 
vehicles in the lot were not able to re-
trieve them until the next day.

 “We have not identi�ed the woman 
yet,” Rooney said. “We don’t know what 
her cause of death is either.”

An autopsy is scheduled for the 
morning of Nov. 1. No additional de-
tails have been released yet.

�e San Diego Police Department 
Homicide Unit is the lead reporting 
and investigating agency investigat-
ing the case, with assistance from the 
UCSD Police Department. Anyone 
with information is asked to call (619) 
531-2293.

See HEALTH,Êpage 4

This Wednesday, A.S. Council will vote on new media legislation that will limit the amount of funding publications can 
receive to $450 per quarter. The legislation 
would also require publications to raise 25 
percent of funding from outside sources in 
order to receive continued financial support 
from council. 

The guidelines were created by Associate 
Vice President of Student Affairs Carli Thomas 
and Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang. Thomas said they started working 
on the legislation over the summer and based the 
guidelines on similar models at other campuses. 

“I looked at [other] media funding guidelines 
and processes, and picked the best one for 
UCSD because we’re pretty liberal in terms of 
media funding,” Thomas said. “I mixed a few 
models together — a lot of the UCs don’t have 
any media funding or they have tiered funding. 
I used some of the model from UC Riverside, 
because they have caps as well.”

The new guidelines allow existing media 
orgs to be funded a maximum of $450 per 
quarter, while media orgs within their first year 
of publication can receive no more than $200. 
The caps apply across the board, regardless 
of whether the publication is a magazine or 
newspaper. Ang said this is to ensure that 
council does not favor one over the other. 

Prior to these new guidelines, council 
allocated money from the set media budget for 
each organization, without limits on how much 
money each could receive. For example, fashion 
publication No. 15 magazine received $9,000 
last year for one issue with a 3,000-print run. 

“There are financial limitations and 
boundaries for the Associated 
Students, so caps need to be 
initiated because we just don’t 
have enough money,” Thomas 
said. “It’s not my intention to 
hinder media orgs, it’s something

ScientistsÊCompileÊLibraryÊof Ê600ÊTypesÊof ÊFatÊinÊBlood
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Regina Ip
Associate News Editor

A national team headed by UCSD 
researchers has created a library of 
almost 600 types of fat that circulate 
in human blood.

The research project, the first of 
its kind, is called LIPID MAPS (Lipid 
Metabolites and Pathways Strategy). 
It identified and measured 588 lipid 
species under eight categories. These 
types of fat provide energy, build 
cell walls and acting as signaling 
molecules. 

“One of the things that was 
very useful was that we’ve never 
done an analysis of human plasma 
before, so we were able to develop 
methodologies, [which] helped 
us discover new lipids that were 
previously unknown in human 
plasma,” research associate Aaron 
Armando said.

With the help of 12 laboratories 
at nine universities, medical research 
institutes and companies, UCSD 
researchers put together profiles that 

include the genes, structures and 
functions in body systems, processes 
and diseases.

“Using our methods that looked 
for much more than previously 
known, we were able to find and 
quantify more lipids than [has] ever 
been previously done,” Armando said. 
“[By creating this lipidome, it’s] not 
only having those reference standards 
but also increasing the knowledge of 
lipids in plasma.”

The 588 are only a minimum 
for the number of lipid species. The 
upper limit of species has not been 
determined yet, but it is estimated 
that it will reach in the ten thousands. 

The number was based on 
a new human plasma reference 
material, which was put together 
by gathering plasma samples from 
100 individuals who underwent 
overnight fasting. These individuals 
were between 40 and 50 years of age 
and their ethnicities and gender were 
representative of the U.S. population. 

The project provides information, 
research data and tools on lipid 

metabolism and the role of lipids in 
health and risks like diabetes, stroke 
and cancer.

The UCSD team focused on 
compiling 107 profiles of fatty 
acyls — which are one of the most 
fundamental categories of lipids 
— that include fatty acids and 
eicosanoids. 

Fatty acids — considered good 
fats used for energy — help in 
digesting cholesterol in the arteries 
and regulating blood pressure. In 
addition, they can signal molecules 
in diseases. 

Eicosanoids are hormones that 
play large roles in the immune system, 
acting as messengers in the central 
nervous system for processes like 
fevers, inflammations or regulation 
of blood pressure.

Researchers said the challenge in 
mapping lipids is their abundance 
and diversity compared to other basic 
molecules, like sugars and amino 
acids that are limited to certain types 
and variations. 

Before compiling the lipidome, 

not much was done to gather 
knowledge about lipids. 

“Normally, when you get your 
blood drawn, the doctor looks 
at things like cholesterol and 
triglycerides, but there hasn’t been 
anything really established for most 
of the other lipids,” Armando said. 
“It’s never been done to the diversity 
that we’ve done it.”

proven if there is evidence of a connection 
based on different factors, including geography, 
kinship, linguistics, folklore and oral tradition.

The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriations 
Committee submitted a request asking 
for the remains to be reburied to UCSD 
administrators in 2006, claiming the bones 
belonged to Kumeyaay ancestors. 

But in 2008, a faculty panel determined 
that the bones could not be proven to have 
“cultural affiliation” with the Kumeyaay tribe, 
releasing a paper that said the bones predated 
the movement of the Kumeyaay into the region.

Now, UCSD spokesperson Christine 
Clark said the university is working with the 
Kumeyaay tribe and UC system under new 
Department of the Interior regulations to get 
the bones returned. On March 15, 2010, the 

Department of Interior amended the NAGPRA 
to state that “culturally unidentifiable” bones 
can be returned if a local group of American 
Indians with a connection agrees to act as a 
representative and claim the bones. 

“The [Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation 
Committee] wrote a letter informing the campus 
that the La Posta Band of Mission Indians, a 
federally recognized tribe, had been selected 
for the proposed transfer of human remains 
and funerary objects from the University House 
property in La Jolla Farms,” Clark said. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox stressed that 
the university is waiting on the tribes for the 
next step and a date for the return has not 
been set.

that I had to do with the budgetary limitations 
that we have. In terms of funding, we have the 
means to say yes, but not the means to say no, 
and we needed guidelines to let us objectively 
fund media orgs.”

The 2010-11 media budget is $38,000, 
roughly $26,000 has already been allocated 
for Fall Quarter and Thomas took out $1,000 
for a new sponsorship program. The $450 cap 
number came from dividing the remaining 
$11,000 among the number of orgs that usually 
apply. Thomas said that new media orgs are 
given less money to encourage them to look to 
alternative sources of funding. 

“If you’ve been along longer, you’re more 
well-established, so these orgs should have more 
precedence and get more funding,” Ang said.

MQ Editor in Chief Patrick Reischl said 
the $450 cap is inadequate for most campus 
papers. For example, each issue of the MQ, 

which distributes more than twice per quarter, 
costs about $1,000. Reischl acknowledged that 
the MQ receives funding from Muir College 
Council and is in a better position than some 
of the smaller newspapers, but  said it will be 
affected nonetheless. 

“It’s likely we’ll have to scale back the quality 
of our printing, not print in color, not use nice 
paper — it seems very unlikely to be able to 
continue printing the way we normally do,” he 
said. “But the real problem for most other orgs 
that are not like the MQ [is] that [they] cannot 
go to a department and request money; they’re 
the ones who are going to be hit the hardest, 
not … the biggest papers. It’s going to hurt the 
smallest ones, or the ones that haven’t been 
made yet.”

The university is launching a 
second phase of the search for a 
new Senior Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs, after an unsuc-
cessful attempt last Spring Quarter. 

The current interim SVCAA 
is biology professor Suresh 
Subramani, who has held the posi-
tion since Paul Drake retired on 
Oct. 1. He will continue to hold the 
position until a permanent admin-
istrator is appointed, Surbamani 
said in an e-mail.

Though the search for a replace-
ment first began last spring, the 
university could not fill the posi-
tion due to conflicts with compen-
sation, music professor and search 
committee member Charles Curtis 
said. 

Many candidates felt that the 
pay for the position was  not com-
petitive. Although the exact salary 
offered for the position is unavail-
able, Drake was paid $294,416 in 
2009.

The SVCAA is the second-
ranked university administrator — 
below only Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox — and is responsible for deal-
ing with academic programs and 
personnel affairs. 

“Obviously we want to move as 
quickly as we can, but there are just 
many steps and we want to do this 
very carefully,” Curtis said.

Curtis said the selection com-
mittee launched the new search at 
the beginning of Fall Quarter and 
has since looked at files of over 300 
candidates across the country. 

Though they have “substantially 
whittled down” the list potential 
candidates, exact details about can-
didates and numbers is confidential 

information, he said.
Members of the committee are 

dividing candidates into subgroups 
and each are given a set of appli-
cants to look over and assess.

In Curtis’ subgroup, the initial 
pool of applicants included can-
didates from various educational 
institutions, including deans of law 
and professional schools. 

Curtis said the committee con-
siders academic contribution to 
be an important component of a 
potential candidate, in addition to 
administrative experience. 

“The really important elements 
here is to find candidates who are 
also truly outstanding as schol-
ars,” Curtis said. “We feel that the 
extraordinarily highly level of scho-
lastic achievement here at UCSD 
has got to be reflective of the person 
who takes the position.”

UCSD spokesperson Christine 
Clark said in an e-mail that the 
search committee is seeking “a 
strong academic leader who is an 
accomplished scholar and academic 
administrator.”

The applicant must carry a 
record of success in strategic plan-
ning, budgeting, resource manage-
ment and faculty recruiting while 
also having expertise in strength-
ening international collaborations, 
she said.

The search committee is co-
chaired by Director of the California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology Larry 
Smarr and Fox, and includes vari-
ous UCSD faculty.

A target date for when the search 
will conclude has not been estab-
lished.

Readers can contact Asia Camagong 
at acamagon@ucsd.edu.

Terry Leach was appointed interim 
executive director of the project. Leach 
may become permanent executive 
director if the search process finds her 
most suitable.

“It’s possible that students could 
be involved as interns in innovation 
center projects,” Leach said. “Also, 
we intend to incorporate work force 
concerns in some or all of the projects, 
which may include recruitment of 

individuals, for example, interested 
in serving underserved communities. 
Depending on the project, this may 
involve working with undergraduate 
students to help serve as liaisons to 
underrepresented communities.”

According to Leach, the center was 
first proposed in October 2009 when 
administrators saw the federal health care 
reform’s effect on the UC Health system.

“UC Health, which supported 
federal health reform, recognizes 

that the status quo is no 
longer sustainable,” Leach said.

In February of this year, UC Health 
administrators met to discuss health 
care reform and its impact on the 
University of California system. At the 
meeting, medical center and medical 
school leadership expressed support 
for creating a health innovation center.

media org are not principal members 
of another media org, because that 
leads to skewed funding, Thomas said. 

There is also a sponsorship 
program, in which publications 
that are sponsored by the head of a 
department can receive additional 
funding from the $1,000 set aside. 

“The reasoning is that if you have 
sponsorship you can grow as a paper, 
so since you’re taking initiative and 
working for looking [for] sources of 
funding, you deserve more money,” 
Ang said. 

He stressed that sponsors will be 
responsible for advising and helping 
papers fundraise, but will not have 
oversight or veto power over content. 

But California Review Editor in 
Chief Alec Weisman said it would be 
difficult for most papers to receive 
sponsors. 

“I don’t think there’s any department, 
or at least very few departments, that 
would be willing to sign off for any 
political newspaper at all because of 
the controversy,” he said. “What A.S. 
should be doing, if they want to have 
a cap, is have a percentile cap based on 
previous issues and matters like that, 
not an actual cost cap when the free 
market determines how much money 
it costs to print.”

The legislation also states that 
media orgs must raise 25 percent of 
their funding from outside sources after 
the first quarter to receive continued 
funding from A.S. Council. This, 
Ang said, is based on models at other 
universities that have a 50-percent 
threshold for receiving student council 
funding. 

“It sets the precedent that a lot 
of orgs have to fundraise for their 
money, and don’t always receive all 
they need from Associated Students,” 
Thomas said. “They need to be a little 
more self-supportive.”

Weisman said that forcing 
publications to divert time and effort  
to find advertising is unreasonable. 

“Trying to find outside sources 
of advertisement takes up far too 
much time that should be focused on 
writing and improving the quality of 
the paper,” Weisman said. “To expect 
us to fundraise 25 percent to even 
qualify to get A.S. funds is ridiculous.”

Reischl said the advertising caveat 
could limit the free expression of 
papers. 

“I think this requirement to raise 
25 percent of advertising is pretty 
unreasonable,” Reischl said. “A lot 
of papers or magazines on paper, 
find it extremely difficult advertise. 
And when you go into advertising at 

the end of the day you want money 
to print, which means appealing to 
advertisers, which means what you 
print must appeal to advertisers, 
and that doesn’t encourage the 
free thought that universities are 
supposed to get out.”

Thomas said that the funding cap 
is not meant to remain consistent. 
For example, if enrollment goes 
up next year and council has more 
money, there may be a higher cap. 
In addition, council will be helping 
media orgs find outside funding. 

“I won’t leave the media orgs 
alone,” Thomas said. “I’m going to try 
to help them, we’re coming up with 
lists of alternative funding that we’re 
coming up with. But we need to get 
into the habit of not totally sustaining 
media orgs, but assisting them.”

But Weisman said the guidelines 
are unacceptable. 

“If this passes as it is, we’re going 
to have to sue the school and sue the 
A.S. until the point where we get it 
back to where it was,” Weisman said. 

Council will be holding a forum 
with members of campus media orgs 
Monday , Nov. 1 at 3 p.m. in the 
Green Table Room.

SHOULD MEDIA ORGS RECEIVE 
MORE FUNDING? VOTE ONLINE.

√  Yes
√  No

U.S. SENATE: Barbara Boxer

YES on PROP. 19 YES on PROP. 20

Running for her fourth term in office, we know the ins and outs of Boxer’s voting record from the controver-sial to the most obscure.  
We want to know where a senator stands on every issue, 

not just the obvious ones like national security and clean 
energy. And over the past 18 years, we’ve seen where Boxer 
stands on everything from health care (authored legislation to 
give families an insurance premium tax break) to agriculture 
(led effort to increase funding for conservation).  

Fiorina commented on issues guaranteed to hold people’s 
attention, like border control and clean energy. Yet we have 
no idea what her stance is on higher education, or rights for 
seniors and disabled Americans. 

Boxer is pushing for more funding for K-12 and higher 
education by increasing Pell Grants and reducing student 
loan interest. An early opponent of Prop. 8, she supports 
marriage equality and authored the Clean Energy Bill that 
will create hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs in 
California and reduce dependence on foreign oil. 

What little of Fiorina’s stances we do know, we don’t like. 
Strongly supported by Sarah Palin, Fiorina’s been quoted say-
ing “I would absolutely vote to overturn Roe v. Wade if the 
opportunity presented itself.” Yikes.

And while Boxer advocates for Wall Street reform, former 
Hewlett-Packard CEO Fiorina is looking out for the big cor-
porations. Last year Fiorina opposed the financial regulatory 
reform bill, which would protect consumers from corporate 
abuses in mortgage, credit and other types of lending, and 
create a council to watch out for financial threats. If that’s not 
enough proof, just look at the top donors to Fiorina’s cam-
paign. While Boxer’s top donors includes children’s protection 
group Emily’s List and our very own University of California, 
Fiorina’s top campaign contributors are Goldman Sachs, 
Morgan Stanley and Occidental Petroleum. 

We need someone who knows their way around D.C., 
not someone trying to find their footing in the complexities 
of our government. And it doesn’t hurt that Obama has her 
back. 

NO on PROP. 27

Our main concern in deciding 
whether to vote for Prop. 19 was cen-

tered around public safety. We still don’t 
have any definitive test to determine what 

constitutes driving “under the influence,” or 
any correlative tests to distinguish how stoned 

is too stoned to drive. But the Legislative Analysts 
Office stated that “the measure would not change existing laws that prohibit driving under 
the influence of drugs, or that prohibit possessing marijuana on the grounds of elementary, 
middle and high schools.” It’s already illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana in 
California — last year alone there were 1,100 prosecutions — and Prop. 19 won’t change 
that, so there’s unlikely to be a huge influx of stoned drivers.

Concerns about employees — especially those in the transportation industry — being 
allowed to go to work high are also unwarranted. According to the Legislative Analyst’s 
Office, employers can still fire employees that show up to work high, just as they could fire 
employees who show up drunk. Just like with alcohol, employers won’t be able to monitor 
what employees do off the clock, but on the clock, they’re still expected to uphold their 
duties. 

Additionally, Prop. 19 prohibits smoking and consumption in public places, effectively 
banning employees from smoking on breaks. 

Prop. 19 puts the Californian police force back to fighting serious bad guys, gener-
ates over $1 billion in much-needed revenue for our state, and allows us to light one up 
without constantly looking over our shoulders for those less-than-friendly red and blue 
flashing lights. 

Boxer 49%      Fiorina 41%       Other/Undecided 10%• •   

Currently, the state of California is divided into 53 congressional districts, where voters 
each elect a member of Congress to vote for them in the House of Representatives. Prop. 
20 would create fairly drawn districts to make elected 
officials more accountable. The practice of ger-
rymandering — or drawing up congressional 
districts to ensure a political party’s dom-
inance within an area — means that 
politicians have their own agendas 
when drawing these boundaries. 
It’s worth it to use taxpayer dollars 
(like for any proposition) to ensure 
accountability when Congress 
members are worried about entities 
beyond the constituents they repre-
sent. Those against Prop. 20 think 
the commission does not guarantee 
fairness and — since the commis-
sion members are not elected — is 
not accountable to voters. But Prop. 
20 requires an applicant review 
panel made up of auditors that screens 
applicants for the commission and 
ensure minimal conflicts of interests. 

This former California Governor, former Oakland Mayor and 
current Attorney General is a far cry from the Republican party’s 
front-running candidate and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman.

Brown’s track record — which includes creating 1.5 million 
jobs by creating the first energy efficiency policies, tackling crimes 
by expanding a DNA lab, creating a gang-free zone and shutting 
down illegal drug operations — demonstrates his commitment to 
ridding the state of its $19-billion deficit. Plus, he went duck hunt-
ing with chief justice Earl Warren, the namesake of one of our six 
colleges. 

Brown’s tendencies of favoring the working class — by suing 
companies for violating labor laws — gives him a gold star of 
approval.

Although Whitman has 30 years of experience in creating jobs 

and managing large organizations under the corporate setting, 
it’s unsettling to see her motives when it comes to opposing the 
D.R.E.A.M. Act, being convinced that weed is a dangerous gate-
way drug, not voting for 28 years and the controversy over how 
she treated her undocumented housekeeper.

It’s heartwarming to see a detailed proposal on education 
reform and a good knowledge of higher education’s needs on 
Brown’s website. In contrast, it’s hard to find where Whitman’s pri-
orities are when her answer to stopping tuition increases is magi-
cally investing $1 billion into the UC and CSU systems.

Of the six remaining candidates, Brown is already leading 
the polls and has a pretty good chance in the Tuesday elections 
with the support of Democrats, women, Latinos, liberals and the 
swinging votes of moderates.

GUARDIAN VOTING GUIDE 2010
INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN 

TACO TUESDAY AT THE BAR, 
TAKE IT TO THE POLLS AND 

VOTE IN THE ELECTION.

GENERAL ELECTION

What it would do:  Legalize 
marijuana purchase and consumption for 
those over 21 years old. 

Why you should vote yes: 
With California’s budget deficit at 
a record $20 billion, we desperately 
need the $1.4 billion Prop. 19 will 
generate for our state. 

What it would do: Prop. 20 gives the job of drawing congressional district maps to 
citizens rather than members of Congress. The citizens will be part of an existing Citizens 
Redistricting Commission, which uses the same U.S. congressional and state rules. Prop. 
27 has conflicting goals and would eliminate this commission in favor of returning this 
responsibility to elected officials. If both measures pass, the one with more “yes” votes will 
go into effect.

OPINIONÊ MONDAY, NOVEMBER 01, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7

YES on
PROP. 21

Under Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s tenure, the fund-
ing for California’s state parks 
has been in severe jeopardy. The 
Governator threatened a 10-percent 
budget cut in 2008 that would have 
closed 48 of the 279 state parks. 
When that was rejected, he pro-
posed a $70 million budget cut in 
2009 that would have left us with 
only 59 protected places to shed 
that urban baggage and breathe air 
that hasn’t been inundated with 
exhaust fumes. As it is, the parks 
are running on empty, with over 
$1 billion in deferred maintenance 
caused by chronic underfunding.

So yes, Prop. 21 costs $18 every 
time you re-register your vehicle, and 
that number is nothing to sneeze at. 

But the parks can no longer 
afford to rely on the $130 they get 
from the legislature — which, if the 
bill passes, will revert back to the 
General Fund to be used for other 
programs.

Plus, those obligated to cough 
up (which doesn’t include drivers of 
motor homes, trailers or commercial 
vehicles) get free admission into the 
parks they’re helping to keep afloat. 
This measure could mean that an 
otherwise couch-bound family takes 
a trip to Anza-Borrego Desert or Big 
Sur — just to make sure they’re get-
ting their money’s worth.

NO on PROP. 22

Prop. 22 would cripple our state gov-
ernment further, making programs 

like higher education even more 
vulnerable than they already are. 
The state borrowing from local 
governments to keep itself 
afloat is a stopgap, it’s true — 
one that hampers counties’ 
and cities’ abilities to fund 
things like K-12 education and 
local infrastructure. But the 

states gives a lot of its funding 
back to these local governments 

in the form of contracts or categori-

cal grants for things like education or clean energy. In addition, the 
money that supporters charge gets taken from relief workers (like 
local firemen or police) go toward rescue services that local govern-
ments can’t handle, like stopping the spread of wildfires or providing 
relief after an earthquake.

Right now, the state is struggling. It’s frustrating to have California 
knocking on your door and borrowing a couple billion dollars, but 
forcing the state to draw from its general fund to keep programs 
like higher education running is going to stretch those already thin 
resources to the breaking point. The loss of flexibility in legislators’ 
ability to manage the budget — forcing them to draw almost exclu-
sively from the General Fund — would be extremely harmful to state 
services This is a showdown between Congress and the city councils 
that, for the moment, can wait.

YES on
PROP. 21

NO on PROP. 23

It’s telling that two main sponsors of Prop. 23 — the “Dirty Energy Bill” that 
increases air pollution while eliminating clean energy jobs — are Texas-based oil 
companies whose CEOs would make a killing without having to breathe the newly 
emitted pollution. 

Prop. 23 aims to repeal the Global Warming Solutions Act — which requires 
greenhouse gas levels to return to 1990 levels by 2020 — 
until our 12.4-percent unemployment rate hits 5.5 
percent. The logic follows that lowering environ-
mental standards means fewer costs for compa-
nies, creating more jobs and lowering prices.

Supporters say that the Global Warming 
Solutions Act is a secondary concern during 
economic crisis, and it would be temporary, 
only until we’re back at 5.5-percent unemploy-
ment rate we hit just four years ago. But four 
years ago was before the 2008 crash and reces-
sion, and we’re not going back anytime soon. In 
the meantime, hurting both the environment and 
one of our biggest job sectors in our panic over the 
recession is wrong, opening the doors to a couple of Texas 
CEOs spewing to the skies.

California recently updated its tax laws to attract 
new jobs and businesses, but Prop. 24 will smother 
that initiative.  Prop. 24 tries to eliminate Gov. 
Schwarzenegger’s proposed tax break, putting a 
$1.3 billion burden back on more than 120,000 
struggling businesses. Rather 
than saving money, this 
proposition will 
result in small 
businesses 
closing down, 
causing 
California to 
lose approxi-
mately 
322,000 jobs 
and $1.8 bil-
lion in lost tax 
revenues.  
To make matters 
worse, businesses will flee 
to other states to take advantage of the rewarding 
tax laws California once had.  

In this struggling economy, California should 
rebuild its economic infrastructure by rewarding 
creators of new jobs and businesses, not punishing 
them. 

Teacher’s unions may back this initiative, 
but not giving California’s businesses a moment 
to catch their breath will damage our ability to 
fund vital aspects in our society, in the long run, 
including schools, transportation and medicine.   

What it would do: Proposition 24 would 
increase state revenues by $1.3 billion from increased 
taxes on new businesses. 

NO on 
PROP. 24

YES on PROP. 25

It took 100 days for legislators to pass this year’s state budget — 100 days that 
made it difficult for the state to issue bonds and nearly made the government resort 
to embarrassing IOUs. After all that delay and debate, congressperson after congress-
person spoke about how flawed our budget still is. So it’s high time for Prop. 25 to be 
passed, so the minority can stop grid locking our fiscal decisions. 

Prop. 25 would lower the voting requirement to 
pass a budget from a supermajority of two-thirds to 
a simple majority of 50 percent plus one, though 
it doesn’t change the supermajority require-
ment for raising taxes. In addition, legislators 
would no longer get paid after the budget 
deadline.

California is currently one of only three 
states to require this supermajority and 
though Prop. 25 is no guarantee for perfect 
budgets that pass on time, this is an incentive 
for an otherwise conflicted state Congress to 
work things out earlier. 

NO on PROP. 26

Prop. 26 will raise transaction costs for the California legislature by requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote to pass regulatory (or hidden) fees — something that 
will take unnecessary time and energy to pass, and ultimately 
impacts social services the hardest.  
         The main supporters of Prop. 26 are the oil, alcohol and 
tobacco industries, which don’t want to pay fees to clean up 
after their messes.  
         Most of these “fees” go toward California’s environmental 
programs, which offset the negative externalities that these big 
industries produce.  

        These measures will lose funding 
through Prop. 26 because if a super-
majority is required, gathering the 
support to pass them will be nearly 
impossible.  
      Supporters of Prop. 26 portray 
it as a campaign to “stop hidden 
fees” posing as taxes, but the truth 
of the matter is, these fees are ones 
that benefit the citizens by ensuring 
better overall living conditions.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents 

© 2010. Views expressed herein represent the 
majority vote of the editorial board and are not 

necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents, the 
ASUCSD or the members of the Guardian staff. 

What it would do: Prop. 23 would repeal the Global Warming Solutions Act 
until unemployment hit 5.5 percent.

What it would do: Prop. 25 lowers the voting requirement to pass a budget 
from a two-thirds supermajority to a simple majority of 50 percent plus 1.  

Why you should vote yes: By only requiring a simple majority, the 
budget will be passed sooner and the public sector will receive its funds on time.

What it would do: Prop. 22 would prevent the state from bor-
rowing from local funds to pay for social services..

What it would do: Prop. 26 would redefine any hidden fee 
that pays for public benefit as a tax, subjecting it to a two-thirds 
supermajority vote of the legislature as a “tax increase.”

Why you should vote no: Requiring a two-thirds
supermajority to pass fees on industries like oil, alcohol and tobacco 
is not a good prioritization of government time.

What it would do: Prop. 21 
creates an $18 dedicated tax on 
vehicle registration that would go 
toward the upkeep of California’s 
state parks.

Why you should vote yes: 
Forking out the equivalent of a nice 
dinner once a year is worth saving 
our beautiful state parks.

Why you should vote no: Crippling the state’s ability to pay 
for programs will only hurt education and state debts.

Why you should vote no: We can’t take 
back a promised tax break that 120,000 new busi-
nesses and 322,000 jobs depend on.

Why you should vote no: Prop. 23 is a harmful short-term “fix” that 
helps Texas oil companies and not much else.

DR. MAURICIO 
SERACINI

FOUR YEARS AGO, WE SAT DOWN WITH DR. 
SERACINI AND QUIZZED HIM ON EVERYTHING 

FROM HIS SELF-ASSIGNED TITLE AS THE 
“DOCTOR OF ART” TO HIS APPEARANCE IN 

DAN BROWN’S “DA VINCI CODE”. AFTER THE 
DOCTOR ADDED SOME RECENT ACCOLADES 
TO HIS LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS, WE SAT 
DOWN WITH HIM ONCE MORE FOR A BETTER 

LOOK INTO HIS LIFE, HIS WORK AND THE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT DRIVES IT.

BY BRIDGETT RANGEL  •  CONTRIBUTING WRITER
I L LU S T R AT I O N  B Y  R A E C H E L  W O N G

A rt and science don’t usually mix, but — thanks to the revolutionary work of UCSD professor and alumnus Mauricio Seracini — art history and engineering may 
soon find some common ground. For 35 years, Seracini has used infra-
red technology and ultrasounds to develop a technique for finding the 
hidden histories of famous pieces of art — specifically, Leonardo da 
Vinci’s “Battle of Anghari”, which has been lost for over 500 years. 
The doctor has examined over 2000 paintings using his methods, 
though his biggest endeavor still eludes him. If all goes well, Seracini 
hopes to uncover the missing painting by the end of next year.  

“You should have a way to be able to tell the story behind the paint-
ing,” Seracini said. “There is more than just looking at the surface. 
Technology should help find ways to interact and connect the viewer 
with the painting.”

Seracini acts as director for UCSD’s Center for Interdisciplinary 
Science for Art, Architecture and Archaeology (CISA3), which was 
launched in 2007 at Warren College’s Atkinson Hall. When he’s not run-
ning the department, he searches for the aforementioned painting in the 
Hall of the 500, at Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy. 

Seracini joined the search for the da Vinci mural in 1975. He began to 
suspect that the painting was located in Palazzo Vecchio after numerous 
clues pointed to the Italian room as the painting’s location: A small flag 
in the background of Battle Fresco that reads “seek and you shall find” 
in Latin, an air pocket in the wall where the painting could be and let-
ters (among other literature) that referenced that spot as the painting’s 
location.  The wall in question is  part of a series of paintings that adorn 
the Hall of 500, and each wall depicts Florence’s history. Work has been 
tedious — the Hall of 500 is huge, and was once a gathering place for 
Florence’s 500-man city council assembly (hence the name). 

Searching through destroyed and aging paintings is tricky work; 
conservation is a constant issue, and even touching a painting can cause 
damage to an old piece of art (skin oils have proven to be harmful). 
To search for the lost painting, Seracini used a multi-spectral scanner 
placed in front of Palazzo Vecchio’s wall, which uses different wave-
lengths to scan the mural’s contents. The wavelengths each use a differ-
ent laser, which passes through the top layer of paint, but bounces off a 
certain under-layer, revealing the paint below the surface. Meanwhile, a 
separate head on the scanner runs a chemical analysis for the structure 
of colors used on the canvas, and can detect anything from the combi-
nation of colors used to where the paint was erased — all without ever 
physically touching the painting.

 What is a lawyer?
        A debater? A fi ghter?

 Or more than that?
        A creative problem solver.

           A principled advocate.

      A rigorous and versatile thinker.

 Explore the wide scope of the law 

             in a school devoted to the big picture.

It’s custom to get a quick pep talk from the 
UCSD study abroad office employee prior to 
departure — a general overview of the kinds of 
“cultural differences” to be “highly aware of” on 
your trip, lest someone disgrace our school’s good 
name by demanding free water while donning a 
college sweatshirt. Or, worse, a Pocahontas cos-
tume (hearing you loud and clear on this side of 
the Atlantic too, Penny Rue!).

So far, the most important cultural differences 
in Barcelona have amounted to better coffee and 
way more time to relax — pretty favorable differ-

ences. In the last couple of days, though, I’ve expe-
rienced a marked cultural difference in Spanish 
Halloween. 

Walking home Saturday night, I decided to stop 
in at the bakery next to my apartment for a churro 
and apple pastry (all part of a balanced diet). From 
the window, I noticed a sign advertising new addi-
tions: colorful, bite-sized sweets that stood out 
among the less camera-friendly croissants and 
churros. 

Of course I had to ask what they were. The 
sweets, called panellets, mark one of the hallmarks 
of the celebration of Castanyada on All Saints’ Day 
Nov. 1 — which also explained the mystery of why 
I have the day off school. Nibbling on these, along 
with a couple roasted chestnuts (preferably around 
a bonfire), pretty much makes up the extent of the 
holiday.

Nestled in the heart of Ocean Beach, 30 minutes from 
UCSD lies a burger joint primed to give In-N-Out a run for 
its fast-earned money.   It’s hard to ignore the allure of Hodad’s 
“world’s best burgers” — founded in 1969, it’s a critic’s dar-
ling, named one of CNN’s Top 5 burger joints last year and 
featured (read: gushed about) on Guy Fieri’s  Food Network 
show “Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives” only two years ago. 
       The joint’s interior is reminiscent of a rustic flea market. Co-owners 
Mike Hardin and Teri Rhodes allowed the locals to decorate the 
joint themselves in glorious surf-kitsch; every inch of space is cov-
ered with stickers, surfboards and license plates from all 50 states 
(we searched like mad to find the more obscure ones like Iowa.)  
Beach bums, friends, coworkers, class ditchers and even a four-
star admiral have eaten at this greasy spoon (expect to see 
dreads, tats, piercings, bare feet and smiling faces — dress is 
casual.) Diners can sit at bar height, on Hawaiian-style benches 
in a booth or in the remnants of a VW van.   Despite the 
friendly atmosphere, we recommend ordering take out on a 
warm night — gorgeous Ocean Beach is only a block away. 
Menu-wise, Hodad’s doesn’t suffer from a lack of variety. 

The shop offers sandwiches 13 different ways. The meat is 
smoky-sweet, succulent and infused with the warmth of the grill’s 
smoke (you’ll need  a handful of napkins to stave off a rush of 
juice).   Go for the bacon burger — sprinkled with caramelized 
bacon and crisp, fresh onion, it’ll put the mess OVT serves to shame.  
 Thirsty? Add  creamy milkshakes, malts or cheap beer to 
wash your meal down for $5. Top off the meal with thick 
and salty wedge fries or crunchy onion rings for $1.50, and 
you have the greatest chophouse menu west of the Mississippi.  
   But Hodad’s is not for the small-stomached. It’s mini-burger is half 
the size of a football and comes with a heavy helping of condiments 
including ketchup, mustard, mayo and pickles ($3.75).  Lightweights 
should ask for a little less on top (or pass up the optional sides), 
though the extra won’t cost you — our whole meal was only $11.  
  Hodad’s staff has restaurant service down to a science. We’re 
not sure how they charmed us — maybe it was the prompt drink 
refills, perfecting our complicated orders or asking (repeatedly) 
how our meal was. Unfortunately, you’ll have to race to grab an 
empty table  — on a normal business afternoon, the line of hungry 
hopefuls can stretch down Newport (hint: stop by on a rainy day to 
expedite the wait time).  But once you have a table, the food’s time-
ly arrival will compensate for the restaurant’s crowded bustle.  And 
let’s be honest: At that point, the flavors speak for themselves.

an ancient festival of the dead, except 
you don’t have to sweat the night out 
in a lousy rubber mask or leotard and 
mouse ears. You don’t even have to 
solicit strangers for a mushy piece of 
chocolate. You just eat. Not a bad deal, 
if you ask me. 

Over the last few years, though, 
sources informed me that American 
influence has crept its way into Catalan 
Halloween. Most people go out, and 
some even bother with costumes — 
mostly gay people, I’m told, who “have 
to be the center of attention.”

While, at press time, I can’t say 
for certain whether the trademark 
“less is more” principle that dictates 
American costume selection holds up 
over here on Halloween night, I’d be 
willing to wager it does. 

Truthfully, though, I’ve never 
been too keen on dressing up, which 
makes me wish that this alleged 
Americanization of Halloween had 
been postponed a decade or so. What 
better way to celebrate the memory 
of the deceased than to lug a bagful 
of sweets down to a bonfire?  Call 
me old-fashioned, but that sounds 
a lot more enticing than holding a 
stranger’s hair while dropping some 
“Maybe He’s Just Not That Into You” 
(or your animal ears) wisdom in an 
airtight I-House bathroom. 

But as for this Halloween, it looks 
like I’ll have no such privilege. My 
friend says he’ll lend me a mask to 
wear out for this night, but I’m not 
sure it’ll hide my disappointment in 
being dragged from my chestnuts and

my friends on Wikipedia insist it’s 
meant to be.

From there, Seracini explains, 
the data is filtered into a virtual 
container that holds “the clinical 
chart of a work of art,” creating 
a high-definition 3-D image, that 
determines approximately when the 
layers were painted (think carbon 
dating, but for paintings).

“It’s like slicing the painting in a 
way, using different wavelengths to 
make a 3-D model,” Seracini said.

Seracini happened upon his 
methods by chance  — out of curi-
ousity, he took an ultrasound to 
a canvas to see what the machin-
ery would detect in the painting. 
He was surprised to see that the 
ultrasound was capable of piercing 
through layers of paint.

This isn’t Seracini’s first project 
— back in 2005, The Guardian (UK) 
reported that Seracini had made an 
artistic breakthrough using a ther-
mo-camera (which forms images 
using infrared radiation), the multi 
spectral scanner and modified mili-
tary and medical technology. 

These uncovered that da Vinci’s 
“The Adoration Of Magi” had a 
plethora of layers under it’s top-coat 
veneer — most of which had very 
little to do with the nativity scene, 
the main subject of the painting. 

In one corner of the undercoat, 
there was a depiction of horse-
men fighting, in the other, a ruined 
building. The usual staples of a 
manger and farm animals (the oxen 
and donkey) were, notably, absent 
in the lower layers.

“The amount of brainstorming 
going on underneath the painting 
is remarkable,” Seracini said in The 
Guardian (UK) interview.

Seracini describes paintings in 
a museum like patients in a hospi-
tal — each one needs to be tended 
to and cared for and, of course, 
examined closely. But his work has 
been slow to catch on. According 
to Seracini, most museums were 

uninterested in using scientists 
among their ranks to fix decay-
ing paintings. Instead, they opted 
to use members from their own 
staff. Despite being 30 years in the 
making, Seracini’s methods are still 
criticized as unorthodox by art his-
torians.

“The eye can be misled, a blue 
can be made with two colors and it 
may seem like one,” Seracini said.  
“Just looking at the surface is not 
enough. You can’t trust your eyes; 
color is subjective.”

Though most museums haven’t 
been able to implement Seracini’s 
techniques due to a lack of funding, 
all the hard work is, paying off — 
two years ago, Seracini was featured 
on CBS’s “60 Minutes” and was 
honored as a National Geographic 
fellow. 

Not that Seracini always had a 
burning passion to put masterpiec-
es under a microscope. A native 
Italian, Seracini came to UCSD 
in 1973 to purse a bioengineering 
major with a minor in art. 

It wasn’t until his return to Italy, 
after graduation, that Seracini’s 
interest in the “Battle of Anghari” 
began. 

During his time there, he met a 
man in a bar who mentioned that 
he was in town to finish up some 
research on the lost da Vinci paint-
ing. 

When Seracini explained that he 
was an engineering major, the man 
asked if he knew of any technology 
that could help them determine if 
the painting was still in Italy.  

Though Seracini had no answers 
at the time, he left the bar inspired 
and went home to write a proposal 
for him. 

Or as Seracini succinctly puts it, 
“It all began in bar.” The rest, as they 
say, is history.

The UCSD Men’s Soccer team 
ended the season on a high note 
this weekend, completing a weekend 
sweep of Cal State East Bay with 2-0 

and 6-0 victories.
On Friday, the Tritons traveled 

to Hayward with a slim chance at a 
playoff birth, but results from else-
where in the conference eliminated 
the squad despite its 2-0 win. Senior 
midfielder David Bakal opened 

the scoring for the Tritons, and 
freshman defender Gavin Lemming 
added his first goal of the season.

Senior Tyler Zupan took advan-
tage of his first minutes of the sea-
son by sending in a cross for Bakal 
in the 14th minute, and Bakal sent a 

header to the far post for his second 
goal of the season. Lemming got his 
head to a corner in the 53rd minute 
for the Tritons’ second goal.

The Tritons returned home on 
Sunday to face East Bay in their 
season finale. Five different Tritons 
tallied their first goals of the year — 
including three seniors — as UCSD 
was dominant in their 6-0 thrashing 
of the Pioneers. Senior Josh Jackson 
had two goals and seniors Brandon 
Yee and Zupan added one apiece 
as each scored his first of the sea-
son. Jackson’s first goal came on a 
penalty kick, but his second was a 
magnificent effort from nearly 30 
yards out.

It is a great way to finish it up,” 
Jackson said. “I want to thank all 
the seniors and our whole team that 
made it possible. We got that first 
penalty kick, and there were a cou-
ple guys that wanted it. I asked them 
if I could have it, and they let me. 
That was a good moment for them 

to give me, and any one of those 
guys would have buried it I’m sure.”

Freshman Andisheh Bagheri 
and sophomore Jordan Valenciano 
each added second-half goals, as the 
Tritons dominated the match from 
the opening whistle. 

“It really was a great way to end 
the season,” head coach Jon Pascale 
said. “It was a great way to send out 
a group of seniors that have really 
done a lot for this program. We’re a 
pretty good team, and I think today 
we showed that.”

The Tritons finished their season 
8-6-4, including 8-5-3 in the CCAA. 
The squad ended with 27 points 
— just four back of a playoff spot 
— and in third place in the CCAA.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The wom-
en’s soccer team collected its ninth 
and tenth consecutive victories 
this weekend, with 1-0 and 2-0 
wins against the Cal State East Bay 
Pioneers.  

The win makes the Tritons 12-2-
2 in conference play, while dropping 
Cal State East Bay to 4-10-2, where 
the Pioneers are currently ranked 
last. The Tritons are now unbeaten 
in their last 13 matches, and have 
moved up 12 spots in the national 
rankings to ninth.

UCSD got off to a slow start on 
Friday, going into the half tied 0-0 
and registering only 4 shots.  

“East Bay has a pretty big field, 
which was hard for us to adjust to 
in the first half,” junior goalkeeper 
Kristin Armstrong said. “It was dif-
ficult for us to move efficiently off 
of the ball and to find each other to 
connect on the pitch and support 
each other, although we picked it up 
in the second half.” 

Armstrong registered her tenth 
shutout of the season in the game 
against the Pioneers, as well as her 
fourth straight.

Just 5 minutes into the second 
period, however, forward Annette 
Ilg put away the winning goal. 
Junior midfielder Annie Wethe 
slotted the ball behind the Pioneer 
defense to find Ilg making a cut-
ting run in behind. Finding herself 
one-on-one with the keeper, Ilg had 
no trouble putting away her eighth 
goal of the season to put the Tritons 
up 1-0.  

The Tritons continued to push 
forward throughout the remain-
der of the match, outshooting the 
Pioneers 10-6. However, the 1-0 
score would hold, despite danger-
ous attempts from junior forward 
Sara McTigue and outside wingers 
Shelby Wong and Jessica Wi.

The Tritons returned home to 
face East Bay again on Sunday, in 
their final game of the regular sea-

son. Seniors Ilg and Lisa Bradley 
were honored before the match.

McTigue scored a brace in the 
first 7 minutes of the match, and 
the Triton defense held on for the 
2-0 victory.

“We started out the game how 
we wanted to start, by controlling 
the ball and getting early goals,” 
head coach Brian McManus said. 
“After that we started to think the 
game was over a little bit.”

McTigue’s goals were her sev-
enth and eighth on the season, tying 
her for the team lead. Armstrong 
recorded her 11th shutout, and 
Wi was credited with the assist on 
McTigue’s second goal.

Cal State L.A. won both its 
weekend matches to stay one point 
ahead of UCSD in the final stand-
ings. The Golden Eagles’ 39 points 
were enough to win the CCAA 
South Division, and gave them the 
top seed in the CCAA conference 
tournament. San Francisco State, 
who is ranked at the top of the 
North division with 32 points, and 
Cal State Stanislaus will join the 
two squads in the tournament. Last 
year’s national runner-up Cal State 
Dominguez Hills has been knocked 
out of contention.

With the second seed in the 
tournament, UCSD will face SFSU 
in the single-elimination competi-
tion held in Turlock, Calif. next 
weekend. The Tritons will enter 
conference playoffs heavily favored, 
having won three of the previous 
five CCAA titles and having been 
picked as the predicted winners 
from a survey of conference coach-
es.

McManus said confidence and 
rest will be key to their success.

“It’s getting their confidence 
back and playing the ball on the 
ground,” he said. “And it’s just going 
to be a lot of rest. With the traveling 
and that, the training room takes 
care of the team now.”

SPORTSÊ MONDAY, NOVEMBER 01, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

Night, as seniors Audrey Green, Alanna Rutan, Cara 
Simonsen and Caitlin Potter were recognized for their 
achievements as Tritons before the team played its last 
regular season match in RIMAC arena.

The Tritons made sure to send off their seniors in 
style, as the squad produced an emphatic 3-0 win over 
Chico State. Brunsting nearly had a triple-double with 11 
kills, 22 assists and 9 digs and Condon once again had a 
double-double in kills and digs. But it was Potter who had 
the final kill to put the Wildcats away.

“It felt really, really great,” Potter said. “To beat them 
in three was remarkable. It’s definitely something to go 
away with.” 

UCSD hit a .305 clip on the match to record its  eighth 
straight win.

“Its definitely one of the best matches we’ve played,” 
Luyties said. “I thought the whole team played well, too. 
Every player on the court contributed in part of the game 
at least, and I think that as a team, this might have been 
our best effort.”

With the victories over Stanislaus and Chico State, the 
Tritons have now beaten all five of the opponents they 
lost to during their five-game skid early in the season. 
Potter had a simple answer to explain the turnaround.

“Practice,” she said. “Taking it one day at a time, and 

building on the beginning part of the season. We had 
kind of a rough start, so beating these teams we lost 
to — especially in three games — there’s nothing better 
than that.”

Luyties emphasized the impact the seniors have had, 
especially in his first year as UCSD head coach. 

“Some of them haven’t been playing that much, and 
they have done an unbelievable job accepting that and 
doing whatever they can to help the team,” Luyties said. 
“As far as them contributing, they all have in their own 
ways, and they have at practice, in pushing each other and 
pushing the new players. They’ve done everything I could 
ask for in that manner.”

Even though the Tritons have won 10 of their last 11 
matches, Luyties said they still have work to do. The team 
is 15-7 overall and 12-6 in the CCAA, putting the Tritons 
in third place in the standings. 

“We’re still looking to win every match right now and 
keep this streak going,” Luyties said. “I still feel like we 
have to win them all. We’re in a pretty good spot right 
now, but things can change pretty quickly. We want to 
keep getting better.”

UCSD will travel to Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Friday before playing at Cal State Los Angeles on Saturday.

if we can’t convert some 6-on-5’s, 
there’s not going to be much of a 
chance,” Harper said. “Getting the 
ball past Bruin defenders is really 
tough. We’ll continue to work on 
our 6-on-5 and hope that improves 
down the stretch here.”

The Tritons won’t be able to 
dwell on their loss, as they face 
important conference games this 
week that will be crucial for getting 
into the WWPA postseason tourna-
ment. 

“We’ve got some huge games 
coming up,” Donohoe said. “We’ve 

got two conference opponents in 
Claremont and Pomona this week, 
so we just really need to clean up 
our offensive play, just make sure 
we’re making the right passes, really 
communicating well and not giving 
the other teams opportunities to 
capitalize on our mistakes.”

The Tritons return to the pool 
for a WWPA conference game 
with Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
this Tuesday, Nov. 2, at 6 p.m. in 
Canyonview Pool.

we’ve been training for eight weeks, 
and training against ourselves, is get-
ting a little tiring,” head coach Scott 
McGihon said. “It’s good to have the 
outside competition.”

The men’s and women’s 200-yard 
medley teams got the meet off on 
the right path. The women’s team of 
Nguyen, Tan, senior Jessica Ferguson 
and freshman Sandy Hon won with a 
time of 1:49.39, while the men’s team 
of Owens, Langland and freshmen 
Nick Korth and Ahiram Rodriguez 
won with a time of 1:35.70.

While the Tritons performed 
well, the team said they were tired 
from the training.

“We’re really tired and we actu-
ally have learned how to race when 
we’re tired,” McGihon said.

Senior captain Anju Shimura also 
said the team did well despite train-
ing through its first duel meet. 

“We’ve been training pretty hard 
and I know the coaches beat us up 
last week,” he said, “But [the team] 
all did really well today. It was really 
exciting. They’re really tired, but 
they sucked it up and did great.”

The Tritons got good perfor-
mances from their freshmen, with 
several taking podium spots.

“We’re expecting a lot [from the 
new guys],” junior captain Michael 
Lorch said. “We believe in them in 
a huge way, and we’re expecting all 
of them to compete at conference or 
nationals.”

UCSD will hope to grow from its 
experience with Clairemont-Mudd-
Scripps, as the squad will travel to go 
head to head with UC Santa Barbara 
next weekend in. The Tritons have 
never beaten the Gauchos in a duel 
meet.

“Going into that meet knowing 
we’ve never beat them is a downer,” 
Shimura said, “But it’s also an extra 
motivation, because this year we 
have an awesome team and I think 
we’re going to do real[ly] well this 
year.”

Nevertheless, the Tritons have 
high expectations for the meet.

“We expect to do extremely well 
at Santa Barbara,” Lorch said. “We 
expect the men and women to win, 
and pull a little bit of an upset. We 
are going to go in as if it’s the end of 
the year and swim as hard as we can, 
even though we’ll probably be tired 
and broken down a little.”

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL WINS ITS EIGHTH 

STRAIGHT MATCH BY AVENGING AN EARLY-
SEASON LOSS TO CHICO STATE ON SENIOR NIGHT

Back in September, the Tritons’ season seemed to be in jeopardy after a fifth straight loss. This weekend, 
the UCSD Women’s Volleyball team 
found some peace by completing a 

sweep in the second half of the sea-
son of the teams that sent the squad 
to the brink.

“I was hoping to win another 
game at that point,” head coach Ricci 

Luyties said. “I know this team is 
good, but we weren’t playing well for 
awhile. I think now their confidence 
is up, and the difference is they’re 
playing well at the end of games.”

The Tritons beat Cal State 
Stanislaus 25-20, 25-23, 22-25 and 
25-19 on Friday night, followed by 
a sweep of Chico State on Saturday 
with set scores of 25-13, 25-19 and 
25-19.

Against Stanislaus, junior Roxy 
Brunsting led the way with 14 kills, 
21 assists and 8 digs. Juniors Hilary 
Williamson and Katie Condon each 
had a double-double in kills and digs 
as the Tritons were able to grind out 
a victory. The Tritons won the first 
two games, but seemed to lose focus 
in the third set.  

“I get worried when they get a 
little complacent,” Luyties said. “As 
we’ve seen, every team can beat us at 
any time, especially if we’re making 

mistakes. If we get in that mindset 
where we think we’re going to win 
and we’re going to cruise through, 
[that] is when we have problems.” 

The Warriors hit .225 in the third 
game and cut the Triton lead with a 
22-25 victory. But the Tritons came 
back in the fourth set, going on a 7-0 
run in the middle of the game to put 
the match to rest. 

Junior libero Janessa Werhane 
added 24 digs, playing an outstand-
ing game defensively. 

“Janessa played really well 
tonight,” Luyties said. “She got to 
balls she hadn’t been getting to ear-
lier in the year. She’s getting digs, and 
her passing has been great all year. 
Now that she is moving and digging 
balls all over the place, it’s really a 
plus for us. She’s really stepped up.”

No. 3 UCLA Pulls 
Away From Triton 
Water Polo

MEN’S WATER POLO — The No. 12 Men’s Water Polo team 
lost to No. 3 UCLA on Saturday, falling 12-4 despite staying 
with the Bruins early on.

“We came out and gave up a couple goals early,” sophomore 
utility Brian Donohoe said. “[We] were able to salvage that 
and tie it up at three, which gave us the impression that we 
could play with these guys. But we just made some mistakes, 
we turned the ball over a couple too many times and they 
capitalized on our mistakes. They were able to put away goals 
and kind of put the game away early.”

Three goals by UCSD’s Ryan Allred, Jakub Bednarek and 
Graham Saber tied the score at 3-3 in the first quarter, but 
the Bruins quickly shot ahead and found net three more times 
before the quarter ended.

“We just fought back in the first half and got it to 3-3, but 
we gave up three goals in 40 seconds,” head coach Denny 
Harper said. “That’s certainly a first for me. We corrected that 
to a certain degree; we did not lose the ball anymore the way 
that we did on the perimeter, but to be fair, this is a UCLA 
team that I think most people feel is a likely national cham-
pion. They’re big, strong, fast and are paid to play.”

UCLA kept the lead for the rest of the game as the Tritons 
were unable to find the offense to turn the game around. 
Senior driver Bryce Madsen added the final Triton goal, mak-

ing it 8-4 at halftime.
“It was definitely offensive mistakes turning into counter-

attack opportunities for them, and stringing our goalie out 
and not giving him an opportunity to make a save,” Donohoe 
said. “Just sloppy fundamentals and bad passing around the 
perimeter. But we did get up and down the pool a lot better 
than we had at different times in the season.

The team plans on working on converting man advantage 
situations in practice this week to gear up for their next set of 
matches. 

“It’s certainly tough enough to beat a team like this, but 

Tritons give up three goals at the end of the 
first quarter and are unable to recover as the 
Bruins gained a 12-4 victory.
