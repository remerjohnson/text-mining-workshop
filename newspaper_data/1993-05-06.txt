ASUCD DIscu .... Fee 
To Support Athletics 
DAVIS -In response to the 
recent rash of budget cuts, UCD 
Associated Students (ASUCD) 
discussed two separate mea-
sures that would increase 
student fees $25.50 and $34, 
respectively. Revenue from the 
smaller levy would support the 
campus' athletic program, 
which is slated for a 100 
per~ent cut in UCD's proposed 
budget. If approved, the larger 
fee would fund on-campus 
health services as well as 
support the athletic department. 
Students will be given a chance 
to choose one of the two 
proposals or reject both 
measures entirely if the action 
is approved by the ASUCD. 

LaIcI-off Lecturer

SANTA BARBARA- UCSB 
administrators reversed

retain Otis Madison, a popular 
Black Studies lecturer. When it 
was announced last month that 
Madison's contract would not 
be renewed, several student 
groups on campus protested, 
accusing the UCSB administra-
tion of discriminating against 
the African-American lecturer. 
Associate Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Personnel Julius 
Zelmanowitz said "new 
information" led administrators 
to reconsider their earlier 
decision. 

Students Push for 
Cultural Requirement 
LOS ANGELES - A new 
coalition of UCLA students has 
formed in an attempt to create a 
campus-wide ethnic and gender 
tudies requirement. A previous 

proposal to institute an Ameri-

rejected by a faculty senate 
committee. In place of the 
American Cultures requirement, 
the committee approved three 
resolutions that attempt to 
integrate multicultural perspec-
tives into the existing cirriculum.

Atkinson: 'We Are in Serious Trouble' 
BUDGET: Task force fmds that 
expected 9 percent cut to UCSD 
will have. serious consequences 
By Karen Cheng 
Associate News Editor 

In anticipation of the third straight year of 
cuts to university funding, a joint Academic 
Senate and administration task force unveiled 
plans last Friday for budget cuts ranging from 6 
to 15 percent over the current proposed level. 
The plan calls for drastic cuts to programs and 
services throughout the university. 

According to the report, the university ex-
pects at least a 9 percent, or $21 million, cut, 
although a final decision cannot be made until 
the UC Regents approve a budget later this 
month. 

To offset the cuts, the plan recommends the 
elimination of hundreds of low-enrollment 
classes and more than 70 teaching positions. 
The fledgling UCSD School of Architecture 
will be uspended or eliminated and several 
departments in the Graduate School oflntema-
tional Relations and Pacific Studies (IRIPS) will 

UC Faces Another 
$200 Million Cut 
By Francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

The cash-strapped University of California 
system may have its state funding cut by an 
additional $200 million next year, over the $135 
million already proposed, in a plan currently 
being circulated in the California Legislature. 

According to University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) Executive Director 
Andy Shaw, the budget proposal originally sub-
mitted by Gov. Pete Wilson last January may 
leave the state with a several billion dollar 
deficit, and the funding shortfall may actually be 
much more severe. 

The legislature's budget scenarios leave out 
Wilson's call for a cut in the renter's credit tax 
deduction, which has met with fierce resistance 
from lawmakers, and the nearly one-and-a-half 
billion dollar federal immigration assistance 
package that Washington has rejected. 

The result has been two possible scenarios, 
according to Shaw. The first, called "scenario 
A," assumes that no additional funding will 

See AJNDING, Page 2 

be closed or scaled back. 
In the first ever state-of-the-campus-address 

on Monday, Chancellor Richard Atkinson told 
a gathering of students and staff that UCSD is in 
dire straights. 

"A 20 percent cut in two years translates into 
bitter, vicious decisions .... We are in very seri-
ous trouble," Atkinson said. 

"The problem is that the state of California 
has walked away from supporting the Univer-
sity of California. It's cJearto me that the UC is 
being held out and asked to take much bigger 
cuts than any other part of the state." 

Vice President External Nick Endres agreed 
with Atkinson, saying that the leadership of the 
state is too wrapped up in petty politics to make 
the right choices. 

"If the legislature and the governor really 
have the best interests of the state in mind, 
higher education would be the last thing that 
would be cut by the budget axe," he said. 

The entire UC system fllces an anticipated 
$243 million shortfall in state funding starting 
July I. The regents have already voted to boost

Judicial Board Finds Siwabessy Guilty 
DECISION: New A.S. president 
found ineligible to hold office 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Senior Staff Writer â€¢ 

The Associated Students Judicial Board ruled 
yesterday that recently-elected A.S. President 
Randolph Siwabes y "was not in good standing 
with the university and thus was ineligible to run 
in the 1993 Spring Election." The decision 
follows the board's hearing on a grievance filed 
by Elections Manager Beth Gesson. 

Mea9while, on Monday the Judicial Board 
refused to hear a second grievance contesting 
Siwabessy's eligibility, deferring the case to the 
ElectionAdministration Committee (EAC). The 
EAC will hear the case at 5 p.m. next Monday. 

Revelle College senior D.A. Bartolotta, who 
lost to Siwabessy in the presidential election, 
filed the second grievance against Siwabessy 
and the "Student Action Now!" slate. contend-
ing that Siwabessy is ineligible for office be-
cause he is not a registered student this quarter. 
and that the rest of the slate may be disqualified 
if Siwabessy is found guilty of a violation. 

Although the decision in Gesson v. Siwabessy 

disqualifies Siwabessy from holding office, it 
does not address whether the vacated presi-
dency should be filled by Vice President Ad-
ministrative Carla Tesak, who takes over if the 
president is removed or resigns. or if a new 
election should be held. 

Judicial Board Chair Sally Sherry said that 
the board would be empowered to make such a 
decision only if presented with a ca e regarding 
how to fill the open seat. 

The Judicial Board heard arguments on 
Gesson's grievance last Friday, despite 
Siwabessy's objections that the A.S. Constitu-
tion assigns the EAC original jurisdiction to 
hear conflicts arising from student elections, 
and thatthe Judicial Board only hears appeal of 
such cases. 

The Gesson grievance was accepted by the 
Judicial Board because the board was told that 
the EAC no longer exists since the election 
period is over. On Monday, former A.S. presi-
dent Mike Holmes, representating Siwabessy 
and the Student Action Now! slate, pointed out 
that EAC members are still in power because 
they are appointed in Fall Quarter to a one-year

Battalion Chief Terry Finch said the exercise 
was intended to give crews experience fighting 
fires in high-rise buildings. 

"This is the first training exercise we've had 
with the San Diego Fire Department - it was an 
extremely beneficial experience," UCSD Fire 
Marshal Richard Benton said.

Berkeley Administration' 
Seeks Budget Priority 
1""""-: UCB says it deserves special treabnent 
during the budget crisis as the 'flagship' campus 
By Ertc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

Chancellors from the nine Uni-
versity of California campuses met 
in Oakland yesterday to detennine 
whether UC Berkeley, as the "flag-
ship" campus, should be treated dif-
ferently than the other UCs in the 
wake of state budget cuts. 

A plan currently under discus-
sion would modify the early retire-
ment plan, devised to reduce costs 
for faculty saJaries, to suit Berkeley's 
needs. Results of the meeting were 
not released yesterday. 

"Because we have older faculty 
than the other campuses, we have 
been hit the hardest by early retire-
ment," said Marie Felde of UCB 
public relations. Although there are 
nine campuses, one quaner of all 
faculty opting to retire early have 
come from Berkeley, she said. 

If the plan is passed, Berkeley 
faculty will be given less incentive 
to retire early than professors at 
other campuses, Felde said. She 
added that the treabnent is not pref-
erential to Berkeley, since it just 
makes up for UCB's losses. 

Berkeley faculty and adminis-
trators may be seeking preferential 
treabnent in a different form, how-
ever. At an April 29 press confer-
ence, UCB Vice Chancellor John 
Heilbron said the schoorshould not 
take as many budget cuts as other 
UC campuses because it is more 
prestigious than other campuses.

academic affairs for the UCB Asso-

appear and calls for an additional 
$200 million cut to the UC. 

The second scenario assumes that 
the temporary half-cent state sales 
tax currently in effect, but due to 
expire in January, would be contin-
ued for the next year. That would 
result in only a $60 million addi-
tional cut. 

"The most realistic scenario is 
scenario A," because of RepubJican

"Using Urey Hall was a chal-

ciated Students (ASUCB), said the 
move for preferential treatment has 
gained support among many UCB 
faculty and administrators. 

"The underlying message [at the 
April 29 conference) was that some 
faculty felt Berkeley, because of its 
reputation, should be spared some 
cuts," Yeung said, adding that the 
sentiment was widespread among 
faculty. 

However, Yeung said that most 
ASUCB officers do nOl support pref-
erential treatment, which he said 
would hurt the whole UC system. 

"Personally, I feel [special treat-
ment is) a misguided notion. It's 
like the legislature is trying to throw 
us a little nugget, and we start fight-
ing each other for what little we 
have," he said. 

Yeung added that it is rumored 
that UCB Chancellor Chang-Lin 
Tien threatened to resign if certain 
measures, such as the modification 
to the early retirement plan, were 
rejected. Such rumors were denied 
by Tien, according to the UCB Of-
fice of Public Relations. 

Office of the President staff 
would neither confirm nor deny that 
UC President Jack Peltason is dis-
cussing possible different lreabnent 
for Berkeley. 

h[Peltason) understands the con-
cems that have been expressed and 
is trying his best to give campuses 
flexibility and discretion in dealing 
with budget cuts," said Office of the 
President Senior Public Informa-
tion Representative Mike Alva. 

resistance to the sales tax, Shaw said 
yesterday. 

But he added that either budget 
scenario "throws everything back 
to the drawing board." 

Shaw said the UCSA is planning 
to lobby for the sales tax continua-
tion and for the proposed elimina-
tion of tax deductions for business 
lunches and country club fees. 

No final decision on state fund-
ing will be made until the governor's 
annual "May revise" is released 
sometime in the next week. The 
May revise updates the budget fig-
ures before the legislature takes fts 
final vote. 

lenge, but it enabled our crews to get 
good practice in working on a high-
rise structure," Benton said. Benton 
added that the exercise helped to 
pinpoint problem areas and drills 
that need more practice. 

The drill was coordinated be-
tween the San Diego Fire Depart-
ment and UCSD's Office of Envi-
ronmental Health and Safety.

Architecture School Nears Oosure Administration, A.S. Come 
To Terms on Co-op Deal CUTS: Task force 

recommends 3-year 
suspension of program 
By ChrIs Jensen 
Associate News Editor 

A budget-reduction task force 
recommended last Friday that 
UCSD's year-Old School of Archi-
tecture be suspended forthree years, 
a move that may lead to the elimina-
tion of the department. 

According to a report drafted by 
task force chairs Stephen Cox and 
Stanley Chodorow, the new pro-
gram would not be able to expand 
fast enough to obtain professional 
accreditation and to "attain matu-
rity." 

The task force recommended that 
the campus "disestablish, suspend 
or discontinue" the School of Ar-
chitecture. 

"The task force believes that no 
conception of the campus' core pro-
grams would put Architecture above 
any of the existing depanments or 
programs. It is inconceivable that 
the campus would disestablish a 

ge~eral campus department or pro-
gram while continuing to add re-
sources to Architecture," Cox and 
Chodorow wrote in the report. 

The task force was fonned to 
make recommendations for imp le-
mentingbudgetcutsatUCSD, which 
may be forced to cut spending by 
nine percent next year because of 
cutbacks in state support for the 
University of California. 

Many of the students and faculty 
atthe School of Architecture will be 

transferred to design programs at 
UCLA and UC Berkeley. Students 
in the one-year "Masters of Archi-
tecture 2" program will graduate on 
schedule in December. 

The Academic Senate Council 
endorsed the task force's recom-
mendation to close the architecture 
school. 

Council chair George Backus 
said the suspension was due entirely 
to budgetary reasons. 

''There is no question that all the 
people [in the School of Architec-
ture) are highly competent.. .. This is 
definitely a question of budget," he 
said. 

Associate Architecture Profes-
sor Susan Ubbelonde called the fac-
ulty "world-class." She said when 
the school was initiated several years 
ago, 300 people applied for five 
professorships. 

"These were the plum jobs ... ," 
she said. "These were the most ex-
citing jobs for architecture faculty 
in the last 20 years." 

Ubbelonde said she is trying to 
get a faculty spot at UC Berkeley for 
next fall, adding that the architec-
ture faculty feels cheated. 

"We feel like we've had a couple 
years of our professional Ii ves taken 
away from us," she said. 

According to Backus, students 
entered the program under the as-
sumption that the department would 
grow and become accreaited over 
the next few years. 

The decision will allow students 
to make other educational plans and 
hopefully enter a professionally-

accredited architecture program, he 
said. 

David Johnson, a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Architecture, 
said there was "a great deal of help-
lessness and frustration" among stu-
dents who entered the new depan-
ment this year. 

"I think there's a lot of short-
sightedness in the midst of [the bud-
get cuts]," said Johnson, who will 
be transferring to UC Berkeley in 
the fall. 

According to Backus, the actual 
disestablishment of a deparnnent is 
a "complicated" process that will 
not be complete for some time. 

"There'$ a lot of ground to be 
traversed before something actu-
ally happens," he said. 

Backus added that a recommen-
dation to the chancellor must be 
made by Vice Chancellor of Aca-
demic Affairs Marjorie Caserio if 
the school is to be closed down. 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson must 
then make a recommendation to the 
UC Regents before the proposal is 
approved. 

But Ubbelonde said that since 
the school will have no students and 
no faculty for the next three years, 
the "procedures [for disestablishing 
the school) are irrelevant." She said 
that the preliminary suggestions the 
task force made in March were 
enough to effectively close the 
school. . 

Ubbelonde added that the school 
"will probably be left to exist on 
paper," instead of being formally 
closed by the regents. 

By Elaine Camuso 
Staff Writer 

After two months of negotia-
tion, the Associated Students and 
the administration signed the Co-
op Memorandum of Understand-
ing, leaving only the co-ops and 
the Graduate Student Association 
(GSA) to sign before the May 30 
deadline. 

In a meeting last Saturday, the 
A.S. voted to approve fonner A.S. 
President Mike Holmes' signature 
onthedocument. Thecouncil voted 
10.0, with two abstentions. 

After the vote, Holmes was 
optimistic that the other parties 
involved would sign as well. "I 
feel the council was really work-
ing in good faith to get the provi-
sions in there that all parties would 
agree to," he said. 

The administration approved 
the agreement yesterday. when it 
was signed by Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Joseph 
Watson. Acting Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Programs 
Lynne Peterson, who served as the 
university's negotiating represen-
tative, said that she thinks the A.S. 
did everything possible to revise 
the memorandum to the satisfac-
tion of all those involved. 

"I certainly think it is a fair 
document," she said. "Mike 
[Holmes) and his committee have 
done their best to look out for the 
students' best interests." 

However, co-op negotiator 

Chloe Burke said that she feels the 
AS. was hasty in approving the 
document. She said she is not sat-
isfied with the provisions for stu-
dent autonomy, panicularly one 
clause which makes clear that the 
AS./GSA oversight of the co-ops 
is a regent-<ielegated authority. 
"The fact that they signed the docu-
ment with this clause included 
makes me think that the AS. did 
not look over this document very 
carefully," she said. 

Acting A.S. President Carla 
Tesak said that the council was 
aware of the clause, but that it is 
something which is unavoidable. 

''The AS. and GSA are not 
autonomous [as of now), so we 
need the administration 's approval 
to get involved in the co-ops over-
sight," she said. 

Holmes agreed with Tesak. 
saying, "We have not been histori-
cally autonomous, so it is a much 
different situation [than if we were 
autonomous). We were not going 
to jeopardize the agreement with 
the co-ops by not signingthedocu-

"The goal of the autonomy sec-

Tesak agreed, citing a clause 
which requests that the adminis-
tration prove its support of au-
tonomy in a letter to the regents.

While 5lwabe_y Bums 

Based on their perfonnance this past week, the members of the 
A.S. Judicial Board will never run the risk of being mistaken for 
Solomon. Unlike the biblical king who was renowned for his 
wisdom, the Judicial Board will likely be remembered for its 
inconsistent rulings, its clumsy grasp of procedure and its slight 
understanding of the rules that it was created to enforce. 

On Friday, in the case of Gesson v. Siwabessy, the AS. Judicial 
Board ruled that it had jurisdiction in the case filed by AS. Elections 
Manager Beth Gesson against newly-elected AS. PresidentRandolph 
Siwabessy. But on Monday, during a second grievance hearing over 
a complaint filed by Revelle College senior D.A Bartolotta against 
Siwabessy, the board ruled that it did 11of have jurisdiction. 

But for a moment, forget about these inconsistent rulings and 
complete disregard of precedent. And forget about the fact that it 
took the judicial board nearly an hour to render a decision on a single 
objection, The most appalling offense in this AS, election sideshow 
is the decision to close the Gesson v. Siwabessy hearing to the public. 

After a motion by Vice President Administrative Carla Tesak, the 
Judicial Board agreed to close the hearing due to the personal nature 
of the testimony. Tesak wanted to spare Siwabessy the indignity of 
having his academic record thrust into the glare of public scrutiny, 
and the Iudicial Board readily complied, While this is certainly polite 
of all the parties involved, it is also legally questionable. To our 
knowledge, a public hearing cannot be closed simply because it 
might be embarrassing to a student. By ignoring this fact, the Judicial 
Board has proven itself to be inept when it comes to matters of 
procedure. While its rul1ng in favor of Gesson is a fair decision, the 
Judicial Board went about the hearing in the wrong way. 

Not that Siwabessy and Tesak have behaved like the paragons of 
virtue during this whole sordid affair. Indeed, their actions in this 
matter are equally suspect. By moving to close the hearings to the 
public, Siwabessy and Tesak basically argued that A:S. officials 
cannot be held accountable by the students that they represent. These 
actions show a contempt for the student body and a cynical approach 
to government normally associated with campus administrators. 

If you can ' t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen - so goes the 
old cliche. By hiding behind the closed doors of the Judicial Board 
hearing, Siwabessy tried to have it both ways. The Judicial Board's 
ruling in the Gessol1 case is fonunate then. Siwabessy couldn't stand 
the heat - it is only fitting that he 's been asked to leave the kitchen. 

No More Fun for the Sun God 
Fed up with the rowdy concen-goers and drunken UCSD stu-

dents that accompany the annual Sun God Festival, the UCSD 
Police have issued an ultimatum. Either the A.S, increases security, 
fences in the Price Center and agrees to other increased security 
measures, or there will be no concen, The AS., realizing that a Sun 
God Festival without a Friday night concen would incite a rebellion 
among the masses, reluctantly agreed, At this year's concert, the 
Price Center will be fenced in, only students with IDs and one guest 
will be admitted and anyone who looks intoxicated will not be 
admitted - all in the name of safety. 

The police depanment' s concern for student welfare is touching, 
but misguided. Clearly, drunken revelers have been a problem at 
past concerts. and the police are correct to take some measures to 
solve the problem, However, the police's demands go overboard. 
For example, the Bulls' Eye Tavern will stop serving alcohol at 7 
p,m., a nice idea, but one that cripples the already moribund social 
life here at UCSD. 

More importantly, the added security and the cost of the fence 
have driven up the price tag for the Friday night concert. according 
to Sun God Festival Chair Cecelia Lucero. That's just the sort of 
news students needed to hear during a massive budget crisis, 
especially as the AS, programming budget evaporates into nothing. 
It would be nice if the police had the same concern for students' fees 
that they have for running an orderly concert, 

Heaven and the administration forbid that students actually be 
given a chance to enjoy themselves during the college years. And it 
would be a complete disaster if the police were to treat college 
students like responsible adults. If this trend continues with future 
festivals, it is probable that the Sun God Festival will be crushed 
under the weight of the same bureaucratic regulations that bumped 
offtheTGs.

IN MEMORY 
OF CESAR 
CHAVEZ 
COMMENTARY: Cesar 
Chavez will join the ranks of 
the great men and women 
who dedicated their lives to 
the bettennent of humanity 
By James Tocco 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Jesus Christ, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Ir. 
Hearing those names sends a chill up the spine. 
These are men who dedicated their lives to the 
benennent of all humanity. Men whose lives are 
symbols of the neverending struggle for human 
dignity. Men who never feared sacrificing their 
own lives to benefit that struggle. Men who in-
spired the late Cesar Chavez, who died in his sleep 
on April 23. 

Born in 1927, Chavez was raised as the son of 
migrant fann workers. His childhood was one of 
constant mobility: he attended over 60 different 
elemental)' schools and lived in labor camps that 
lacked such comforts as adequate bedding and 
clean drinking and bathing water. He was destined 
to follow his parents into the life of a migrant fann 
worker - struggling to find worl<, constantly 
relocating to wherever work was available, being 
underpaid, overworked and without legal or soci-
etal recognition. However, the life of Cesar OIavez 
proved to be much more influential than the 0p-
pressed, voiceless fann workers to whom he would 
eventually become an inspiration. 

Chavez began his activism in the early 196Os, 
organizing a Mexican-American migrant fann 
workers' union which later became the powerful 
United Fann Workers, Chavez's organization was 
forced to strike against California grape growers in 
1965 in order to gain recognition and suitable 
working conditions (toilets, for example). 

Chavez grabbed the public's attention during 
his first month-long fast, which he said represented 
"the pain and the suffering of the fann workers." 
The first of many sym bolic fasts, aided by various 
Hollywood celebrities and political giants such as 
Sen. Robert Kennedy, resulted in a nationwide 
grape boycott. Thiseventuallycompelledthe grape 
growers to sign labor contracts with the fann 
workers. This officially rendered political clout to 
Chavez and his organization, but his influence in 
labor and politics was only a portion of his overall 
benevolent impact 

Chavez began as a leader for Mexican migrants 
and their families to follow. He helped create and 
continually promoted EI Teatro Campensino (''the 
peasant theater"), a Latino theater group in 
California's central valley. The theater is a hub for 
artists and a treasure chest filled with Latino art, 
from paintings to literature to music to plays-all 
laced with the ongoing struggles ofLatino-Ameri-
can people, the struggle of Chavez's life, I am 
willing to bet that there isn '( a Latino artist today 
that wasn't in some way inspired by CesarOlavez 

, and EI Teatro. His selfless leadership WKJuestion-
ably inspired Latinos in all walks of life to an 
immeasurable degree. 

President Clinton addressed Chavez's death in 
a speech recently, saying that Americans have lost 
a great leader, But the influence of a truly great 
person never dies. The messages left by history's 
heroes, Jesus Christ, Gandhi and Martin Luther 
King, Jr., never die because they are one and the 
same. 

Every oppressed group has, or. needs, a leader 
- someone to inte'1'ret and promote this universal 
message of hope to his or her people. However, 
since the message's meaning is universally appea1-
ing, that leader becomes one of the greats whose 
life inspires all people. Cesar Chavez promoted 
that universal message to Latinos throughout North 
America His message didn't die with him (there is 
still a call for a boycott of California-grown grapes 
because of the health effects that dangerous pesti-
cide usage has on fann workers). And he shall be 
remembered as one of history's true heroes. One 
whose name sends chills up your spine, 

The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: The furor over lifting the ban on gays in the militaty exposes the 
inherent homophobia and ignorance that exists in the United States militaty 

THE MILITARY MAN'S NEW IMAGE 

GAYE 

Recently, a gay male 
in the navy was beaten to 
death by his fellow sail-
ors while stitioned in Ja-
pan, They denied they had 
beaten him until they re-
alized that if found guilty, 
they would be sentenced 
to death. So they admit-
ted to it, plead guilty, and 
will receive a reduced sen-
tence. JDHJf5IIn ] am no expert on the 
issues of being homo-
sexual in America. But 

you don't have to be to understand what this 
type ofthing means for gays in the military and 
in the world for that matter, With the lack of 
media coverage on this issue, the U.S. Anned 
Forces run a parallel course with other em-
bodiments of conservative ideology, This 
power structure has undennioed the impor-
tance of this murder, and the audience has 
accepted it. 

Many chalk it up to the tensions over 
whether or not gays should be admitted into 
the anned forces. But let's face it: as long as 
there has been a military, there have been gays 
in it. For these men not to be out of the closet 
has been the saving grace for the image the 
military wishes to uphold, and the murder of 
this man, as well as the treatment of this case, 
will further close the door between being in 
and being out. This murder victim didn't die 
for his country, he died at the hands of it and its 
continual passive condonation of such brutal-
ity. 

For military officials to say they hold no 
prejudice toward gays, but only oppose having 
them in the military, is an assertion of such 
primitive and profound ignorance that it is not 
verysu'1'rising. The U.S. military is the strong-
hold of a die-hard breed: it didn't sU'1'rise me 
to hear of the recent creation of a "Defense 
Readiness Council," a group of retired mili-

When you think of the U.s 
military, you think

tary officers bent on placing a ban on gays in 
the military. Its purpose is to stop the "admit-
tance and accomodation of homosexuals con-
trary to professional military judgement and 
experience. " 

Because in large part of our military tactics, 
we are a terrifying element in this world -
both to foreign constituencies and to certain 
groups within our own country. When you 
think of the U.S. military, you think clean-<:ut 
strongmen in unifonn - the proud and the 
few. This type of ideology holds little more 
than a homophobic notion that anything stray-
ing from the mainstream idea of "man" is a 
threat to national security. This may be a little 
blunt, perhaps, but no more so than the hypo-
critical assertions of military opposition to 
gays. 

The homophobia on this campus alone is 

nothing to sneeze at. It perpetuates closer to 
home the type of ideology which killed this 
man, It is strong enough to elicit threats and 
hate rhetoric on a regular basis. Homophobia 
and racism alike have these constituencies; at 
least you can give some credit to the racists 
who go about their racism in subtle ways -
it's intelligently planned, Some of the hate 
rhetoric] have heard and seen on this campus 
toward gays, lesbians and bisexuals begs for 
intelligence at the very least. Yet stupidity is 
the nature of ignorance. 

I think that out of my own ignorance of 
lesbian and gay issues on campus and in 
general, [ can only give argument to some of 
the more debated topics: sexual orientation vs. 
preference and tangible homophobia. 

What] can say is that the murder of this 
man in Japan cannot go unnoticed. There is no 
justification for persecuting, let alone killing, 
someone for the way they love their fellow 
human beings. 

There is an important lesson to be leamed 
on both a global and a local level from this 
heinous brutality. And while the confidence] 
have in the ability of UCSD as a whole to 
recognize this does not flood me with inspira-
tion, ] hope a few will understand 

As a campus faced with the eradication of 
low-income students, narrow-minded ideol-
ogy and an administration which passively 
condones both. we cannot afford as students 
nor as citizens to be exclusive. To be able to 
come together in that way is powerful stuff, 
and that is what scares people both here and in 
the military. 

In the absence of substantial curriculum 
and legitimacy about and for homosexual popu-
lations, there are still some people who appre-
ciate the resilience of this group, and the die-
hard ideology that humanity just might over-
come hate. But let 's not get too comfortable, 
because as the murder of this gay male illus-
trates, the struggle for gays to be recognized 
even humanely is far from over, 

STUDENTS OUTRAGED AT SIWABESSY'S SHENANIGANS 
Editor: 

As one of the 700 or so voters in the most 
recent A.S. Election, I was appalled at last 
week's development in the A.S. presidential 
scandal. After reading the title of the article in 
the April 29 Guardiall ("Siwabessy May Be 
Ineligible For Office"). I thought, "Well, that 
makes sense. Siwabessy should not be able to 
take a quarter off, then come back when he can 
afford to pay his fees." 

Later. I realized, this article was not about 
the fact that he is not a student this quarter. His 
position is under scrutiny because he wasn't 
even a student here last quarter. Who is he? 
lust some guy? Has he ever paid his fees, a 
portion of which go to pay his stipend? Is he to 
blame for our budget shortfalls? Siwabessy, if 
you read this: Getaclue! You ripped usoffand 
now your political career is over. You and 
Burnett, Nixon and Hart. Hasta la vista, punk.

Tampon Comments, 
Letter V.We Immature 
Editor: 

In re ponse to Brian Dingledine's letter 
concerning the restocking of sanitary products 

by the administration ("Administration Does 
Not Owe Us Tampons," April 15), I seriously 
questioned its authenticity when I first read it, 
on the basis of its ludicrous content. 

How could I possibly take seriously com-
ments like "we should be pleased that the 
administration is attempting to curb spending 
in such a 'relatively hannless' manner" or "the 
issue itself is certainly 'trivial' ." 

First of all, how dare a male have the 
audacity to judge this exclusively female issue 
as trivial! He adds: ''The harsh truth is that no 
one owes you anything." Then I'm sure he's 
full of comments about the money the admin-
istration also "wastes" for such other "trivial" 
things like accommodating the handicapped, 
since he feels that we have all come to expect 
too much, 

Come to think of it, Brian, we really don't 
need those toilet seat covers they stock either. 

. or even toilet paper, for that matter. Hell, we 
could all bring our own! Of course, males can 
pretty much get by without all that "extra 
stuff'so I'm sure you wouldn't have a prob-
lem with that. 

Tampon machines are not free. They charge 
money, so the suggestion to "get a job" to 
supply our needs is again invalid, insensitive 
and incredibly ignorant. Get a clue! How the 
administration can justify its refusal to restock 
these machines in an effort to cut costs is 
beyond me - unless, of course, it is run by 
someone like you, Brian, 

When you've matured enough to make an 
intelligent comment about this very Itlluni versa! 
issue, then maybe you can write a real letter 
and be taken seriously.

ca......w: ~ Senate should be prepared to give the president's Supreme Cowt noolinee the same treatment as Robert Bode 

WE NEED MORE JUDGES LIKE BYRON WHITE 
By Roderick Lee 
Staff Writer 

The Court ... comes nearest to iIIeÂ· 
girimacy w~n it tkals with judgeÂ· 
made consritutionallow having 1i"le 
or no cognizable roots in rhe IanÂ· 
guage or design of the Constitution. 

-Justice Byron White 
The long road back to judicial 

sensibility hit a major porhole last 
month when Justice Byron White 
announced his intention to leave the 
Supreme Court this summer. Neither 
completely conservative nor liberal, 
White, nevertheless, was likely to be 
found on the side that stood against a 
larger activist role for the Coun. Be-
cause of this stance, his three-plus 
decades of service will be sorely 
mis ed. 

Although many liberals, especially 
the pro-choice and anti-religion 
crowd, pigeonhole White and the 
Court's conservative majority, White 
is the only current Democrat appoin-
tee to the Court, having ascended to 
the position in 1962 under President 
Kennedy. 

Thus, it is somewhat fining that 
the first Democrat in 12 years will 
have the chance to replace the only 
remaining Democrat on the Court. 
Since President Caner was denied an 
opportunity to make his mark, the last 
Democrat to influence the Court was 
President Johnson in 1967, and his 
man, the late Thurgood Marshall, has 
already passed on. â€¢ 

Though a Kennedy Democrat, 
White earned the respect of conserva-
tives for writing the eloquent dissent 
in the notorious Roe \'. Wade case. 
More recently, he sided with the con-
ervative dissenters in both the 1990 

Webster \'. Reproductive Health SerÂ· 
vices ruling and last year's unsuc-
cessful Pennsylvania challenge to Roe. 

As further "evidence" of his con-

Continued from page 4 
the proÂ·snake rebels need 10 do to 
override the Whackers' message is to 
"play something with a lot of bass in 
it. " 

So Barry White is enlisted to sing 
while Lisa plays the bass; Bart tips the 
speakers down and all the snakes exoÂ· 
dus into the Simpsons' house. 

White quiets the mob by crooning, 

servative credentials, he also provided 
the swing vote in the 1986 Bowers v. 
Hardwick ruling that upheld a Geor-
gia anti-sodomy law and dissented in 
last year's antiÂ·religious Lee v. 
Weisman which ruled that public 
school commencement invocations 
are unconstitutional. He opposed 
Miranda and Escobedo, which 
granted new rights to the criminally 
accused. 

But, to stop here and extrapolate 
his record from it, as many shortÂ· 
sighted liberals do, would be sheer 
folly, as this is only half the story. 

White has always stood for civil 
rights, though he opposes extremism 
in the name of"afflJ'l1lative action. "In 
his inaugural year on the Court, he 
ordered the University of Mississippi 
to stop placing roadblocks on the path 
to desegregation. Thirty years later, 
just last summer, he wrote the major-
ity opinion ordering all Missis ippi 
universities to speed up desegregaÂ· 
tion. 

White wrote the majority opinion 
allowing a Georgia student to sue her 
teacher. He found in favor of a man 
enrrapped by a government sting op-
eration against pornography, and 
wrote that opinion as well. He sided 
with the 5-4 majority that made bumÂ· 
ing the U.S. flag "protected speech." 

Which brings us to the present. 
Although White is a cenrrist (with 
slight conservative leanings), one line 
of thinking supersedes both right and 
left considerations: judicial restraint. 

In his 31 years of service to the 
Court, White has almo t always demo 
onstrated a healthy disdain of legis-
lating from the bench. 

His stance in Roe and Bowers and 
other abortion and homosexual cases 
stems from the idea that the "right to 
privacy" central to these rulings is a 
manufactured right, created by the

On the other side, White has gen-
erally taken a broad view of the First 
Amendment, both in regard to speech 
and religion. This is demonstrated in 
his ruling in theantiÂ·pomography sting 
and his position on flag-burning. How-
ever, it is also evident in his assertion 
that the militant ACLUÂ·typesare over-
zealous in erecting the "wall between 
church and Slate." 

Ofcourse, White, like anyone, has 
had his off days, or "off topics." In 
four separate voting rights cases, he 
sided against greater voting freedom, 
most recently writing Ihe opinion preÂ· 
serving a Hawaii election law that 
forbids write-in candidacies. 

Nevertheless, the departure of 
White allows the First Lady (if her 
role in helping Bill fill Arkansas vaÂ· 
cancies is any indication) to tum the 
Court back to its activist past. To-
gether with Justices Blackmun and 
Stevens (or their replacements) and 
the "enlightened" O'Connor, Souter 
and Kennedy, this newcomer, whoÂ· 
ever it may be, could help forge 6-3 
majorities to once again legislate from 
the bench. To the liberals, this ap-
proach avoids the danger of a Repub-
lican filibuster in the Senate or oppoÂ· 
sition in the House from a coalition of 
Republican and conservative Demo-
crats. 

Unfortunately, as the minority 
party, Republican cannot savage 
Clinton's nominee the ame way the 
Kennedy-Biden-ACLU thugs did to 
Judge Robert Bork, still the most 
eminently qualified man for the posiÂ· 
tion. However, that doesn't mean that 
they can't make the confmnation pro-
cess hurt. 

For starters, Clinton has already 
promised he "will appoint judges to 
the Supreme Court who believe in the 
constitutional right to pri vacy, inc IudÂ· 
ing the right to choose." Contrast this 

with Reagan and Bush claims that 
there were "no litmus tests" for any of 
theirnominees. Don't believe it?1ben 
why is Roe still alive? 

Faye Wattleton, former president of 
Planned Parenthood, wanted the Senare 
to reject any nominee that did not make 
his position on abortion known immeÂ· 
diately. Well, now it's the Republicans' 
tum. GOP senators and pro-life Demo-
crJts need to make it known if a nomi-
nee supports "unrestricted abortions in 
all cases," a position held by a scant 12 
percent of the nation. 

The next issue is quotas. White 
supported civil rights but opposed 
quotas. Hillary's woman is likely to 
support them. Any Southern DemoÂ· 
crat who votes to confirm an avowed 
supporter of quotas is just asking for 
trouble come reelection. 

The media pointed to anger at the 
ThomasÂ·Hill hearings as one reason 
for the Senate turnover in last year's 
so-called "Year of the Woman."Well, 
turnabout is fair play, and the RepubÂ· 
licans can hurt Senate Democrats 
something fierce . 

Twenty-two Democrats must de-
fend their seats next year as opposed 
to II Republicans. The more activist 
the nominee, the more dangerous a 
vote in favor of confirmation could be 
to certain vulnerable senators. 

After their dismal showing. or 
rather non-Showing, in the Shalala 
and Reno confirmation hearings. Sen-
ate Republicans handed Clinton de-
feat for his "jobs bill."Thetime is ripe 
to follow up that uccess with respect 
to the upcoming confirmation hear-
ings. The chances of getting another 
Byron Whiteareslim to none, indeed. 
But the GOP can make the Democrats 
pay dearly if they send up another 
activist, a la Earl Warren. To do any-
thing else is to accept defeat before 
the banle begins.

BUDGET: 
UCSD prepares for a 
9 percent funding cut 
ContInued from page 1 
student fees a record $995 and ternÂ· 
porarily cut faculty , staff and ad-
ministrator pay by 5 percent. 

The UCSD Task Force report 
only proposed a preliminary sketch 
of the measures that UCSD might 
take immediately to deal with the 
budget shortfall. It focused mostly 
on the short term crisis, hoping to 
"maintain the excellence of those 
academic activities that can be reo 
tained." 

After compiling information on 
the current spending of different 
departments, interdisciplinary pro-
grams, IRJPS and the School of 
Architecture, each divisional dean 
was to report on the general effects 
of budget cuts ranging from six to 
15 percent in their divisions. Spe-
cific cutbacks would mean the pos-
sible laying off of permanent fac-
ulty, temporary faculty, staff and 
support staff. 

The deans' studies found that a 
nine or 12 pen;ent cut would "limit 
the effectiveness of some units, while 
it would destroy the ability of others 
to perform their essential functions." 

According to the report, UCSO's 
five colleges will remain intact and 
funding for teaching assistants and 
other graduate student programs will

agreement, then it is likely that the 
process of negotiating will end. 

"If [the co-ops) do not sign, then 
the university is going to stan all of 
the procedures against them," 
Peterson said, referring to the griev-

avoid the brunt of the cuts. 
The report also endorses the 

transfer of the Physical Education 
department to the UCSO Recreation 
Program, stating that "It would be 
unacceptable to cut academic pro-
grams while preserving the P.E. pro-
gram in its current form." 

The School of International ReÂ· 
lations and Pacific Studies faces the 
dismantling of its new Korean Stud-
ies program as well as a reduction in 
accounting and language classes. It 
will also lose up to three full-time 
teaching positions. 

The report also found that a nine 
percent cut would have a devastatÂ· 
ing impact on most undergraduate 
programs, many losing nearly all 
temporary faculty. 

A materials fee for students takÂ· 
ing laboratory classes has also been 
proposed to avoid cancellation of 
many such undergraduate courses. 

The economics department may 
have to close its Quantitative Eco-
nomics program and the Psychol-
ogy department would be forced to 
significant! y alter its majorprogram. 

The report also recommended 
that UCSO's research programs get 
priority in the budget crisis. 

The adÂ·hoc task force was cre-
ated to provide the Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Marjorie 
Caserio and the Chair of the San 
Diego Division of the Academic 
Senate George Backus with a report 
recommending priorities for the 

ances filed againsl the co-ops for 
"unsound business practices." 

"We will be right back where we 
were before the negotiations 
started," Peterson added. 

Burke is nol convinced that the 
co-ops will agree to sign the docu-
ment because they are still dissatis-
fied with the provisions. 

"Certain issues which have not 
been resolved [inthememorandum) 
will keep us from signing this docu-

crisis. 

At the campus address on MonÂ· 
day, Endres called for massive lob-
bying efforts to SlOp the cuts, say-
ing, "If the students, faculty and 
staff of this university continue to be 
silent, the situation will only gel 
worse. 

"Many people don'l realize that 
the $995 fee increase and the 5 
percent pay cut passed by the re-
gents is by no means final," he said. 
"The UCs, with all their strength 
and resources, have been virtually 
silenced. What this silence has 
meant to the UC system and higher 
education in general has been three 
years of deep cuts. .. which has 
amounted to over $1 ,000 in fee 
increases, early retirement of many 
of the UC's top faculty, numerous 
staff layoffs and threats to close 
down campuses and programs," he 
said. 

Endres emphasized an all-out 
effort to mobilize students, faculty 
and staff, indicating that everyone 
should write letters to Gov. Wilson 
and.locallegislators now. 

''Talk about the budget, talk about 
the importance of higher education, 
talk about how your fees are rising, 
how your teachers' salaries are beÂ· 
ing cut, and let them know you will 
hold them accountable. Let them 
know that higher education in the

ment," Burke said. "Hopefully, the 
[negotiating] meeting on Monday 
[with the A.S.) will go well," she 
said, adding that she is not very 
optimistic. 

Holmes said that the negotiaÂ· 
tions are very give-andÂ·take, and 
that not everyone is satisfied in a 
true compromise. 

"No one's going to love it, but I 
really think that this is the best for 
everyone," he said.

SIWABESSY: 
President was not 
eligible to hold office 
ContInued from pace 1 
tenn. 

Holmes and Siwabessy said that 
they wanted the case heard by a 
student board, but objected to the 
Judicial Board holding the initial 
hearing in the interest of adhering to 
proper procedures. 

"In the last hearing [Gesson v. 
Siwabessy] we based our decision 
[to hear the case] on misinfonna-
tion. We see that we want to follow 
the correct procedure," Sheny said 
when deferring Bartolotta's case to 
theEAC. 

Regarding the Gesson v. 
Siwabessy decision, Gesson said, 
;'We' reextremely pleased that they 
agreed with our arguments. We talre 
this case to be a mandate that 
Siwabessy was never officially 
elected .. .. 

"We will probably be having 
some kind of election," she pre-
dicted. 

Gesson said that the type and 
scope of a new election will be 
determined by the outcome of the 
hearing on Bartolotta's grievance. 
While Gesson' s grievance does not 
specify what action should be taken 
if Siwabessy is found ineligible, 
Bartolotta's grievance requests a 
run-offelection between himself and 
the second-place finisher in thepresi-
dential election, Third College 
Council Chair James Hill. 

Siwabessy took issue with the 
validity of the Judicial Board's rul-
ing and said that holding a new 
election is implausable because any 
motion to invalidate an election must 
be made within five days of the 
election in question. 

Siwabessy said he feels 
"wronged" by yesterday's decision. 
"I'm not accepting the Gesson v. 
Siwabessy ruling at all," he said. 

Siwabessy contends that, since 

The UCSD Guardian 

the Judicial Board decided to defer 
Bartolotta's case to the EAC, it 
should not have continued hearing 
Gesson v. Siwabessy. "I don't un-
derstand it because I think the cases 
are pretty much the same.. . I as-
sumed that by dismissing 
[Bartolotta's] case,they were going 
to dismiss the first case," he said. 

Siwabessy said he plans to ap-
peal the ruling to theJudicial Board. 
Although the Judicial Board Char-
terstates, "All decisions of the board 
are final," it allows the board to 
decide to re-hear a case upon writ-
ten request "if elltraOrdinary cir-
cumstances arise." 

Both Sheny and Gesson said 
they consider the Gesson v. 
Siwabessy ruling valid. 

Meanwhile, Bartolotta vowed to 
take his case to the administration 
by filing a non-academic grievance 
over the "flawed" judicial process. 

''The Judicial Board is empow-
ered to hear all conflicts that arise 
under the A.S. Constitution," coun-
tered Bartolotta, who was once a J u-
dicial Board member. "I'll be filing 
a non-academic grievance against 
the A.S. advisor [Randy Woodard] 
to have this matter resolved." 

Bartolotta said the Judicial 
Board's decision to defer his case 
was influenced by some of its mem-
bers' relationships with members of 
the Student Action Now! slate. He 
refused to elaborate on which Judi-
cial Board members may have a 
conflict of interest, although when 
Bartolotta asked the Judicial Board 
members to publicly disclose their 
relationships with members of the 
accused slate, Chia-Lin Simmons 
said that she is an inactive member 
of the sorority in which Vice Presi-
dentAdministrativeCarla Tesak and 

DMlChO/~an

. fa read durirw the u. meettnc. 
Vice President Finance NeenaMalik 
are members. 

Holmes and Siwabessy denied 
there is any potential bias among the 
1 udicial Board, noting that the board 
accepted Gesson's case against 
Siwabessy last Friday. 

Siwabessy added that either the 
plaintiff or the defendant in a case 
can move to remove a member of 
the Judicial Board, an option 
Bartolotta did not ellercise. 

Holmes and Siwabessy alsocriti-
cized Bartolotta for promising to 
take the case to the administration. 

"These are student elections and 
student decisions. This should be 
decided by students," Holmes said. 
"We always complain about the 
administration interfering in student 
affairs, then we go to them saying 
'Help us,' when students are just as 
competent." 

"With all the talk about [student 
government] autonomy, appealing 
to the administration would really 
undennine us," Siwabessy said. 

He suggested that the adminis-
tration opposes A.S. autonomy and 

Thursday, May 6,1993 

legitimacy and therefore wO!lld be 
biasedtowarddisqual ifying the slate 
in order to remove the A.S. execu-
tives from power. 

"If it goes to the administration, 
I'll do anything to stop that hearing 
fromhappeningbecauseitwouldn't 
be fair to students at large," 
Siwabessy said. 

Siwabessy said he is considering 
resigning among his future options. 
"There is a conflict between what is 
best for the students and what is in 
my own interest," he said, explain-
ing that the students need to have a 
full A.S. Council ready to do its job, 
and that he is concerned with clear-
ing his name. 

"The importantthing tome is that 
there would be no more elections," 
he said, "because of the cost and the 
time, and if you call for a new elec-
tion, who's going to be running the 
council? It's going to be a mess." 

A.S. Advisor Randy Woodard 
said that he plans to improve his 
system of checking the eligibility of 
A.S. candidates due to the contro-
versy over Siwabessy. 

In the past, including this year, 
Woodard said he is notified by the 
Registrar's Office if there is a ques-
tion about a candidate's standing 
with the university, then he takes the 
candidate's word that the problem 
has been rectified. 

In Siwabessy's case, Siwabessy 
showed Woodard a receipt for his 
Spring Quarter fees, and Woodard 
thought Siwabessy had been cleared. 

However, Woodard said he was 
not aware during Winter Quarter 
that Siwabessy was not a registered 
student. "That kind of shocked me. 
I had no idea .. .. I don't think it's 
appropriate [that Siwabessy did not 
disclose that he was not a student)."

By age 20, Baca, the screenplay writer, 
was serving time in prison, where he taught 
himself to read and write. Hackford said he 
felt Baca's poetic background, the hardship 
he endured and his deep understanding of 
Chicano culture would bring authenticity to 
the film. Hackford said he hopes his story will 
dispel the misconceptions about Chicano 
culture. 

The prison scenes were primarily filmed in 
San Quentin, where with the help of correc-

crew utilized the building's interior as the set

film would incite violence likeJohnSingleton 's

He said that Bound by Honor is not exclu-
sively for Latino audiences, since its themes 
concerning cultural problems are universal.

Goo Goo Dolls 
Buffalo-based trio 

bound to be superstars 

Guitarist-vocalist Johnny Rzeznik isn't totally com-fortable with all the com-
parisons being made between his 
bood, the Goo Goo Dolls, ood the 
Replacements. During a recent 
phone interview, Rzeznik, whose 
bood performs Wednesday night at 
the Pub, said he thinks that people 
are looking for a rock act to fill the 
gap left by the now-defunct Re-
placements. 

"We're kind of searching for an 
identity ,"Rzezniksaid. "I don' tthink 
we sound like the Replacements, 
but I think people really miss the 
Replacements. " 

Superstar Car Wash, the latest 
release by the Buffalo-based band, 
has received praise from critics, and 
the Goo Goo Dolls have gradually 
been playing to bigger and bigger 
audiences. 

"It [success] doesn't really mean 
anything, " Rzeznik said, noting that 
he has to work hard just to make a 
living and doesn't have a bank ac-
count or own a home. "('m just 
happy that people corne to see us 
play." 

The first single, "We Are the 
Normal," was written by former 
Replacements lead singer-guitarist 
Paul Westerberg. The song passion-
ately questions the value of a "nor-
mal" life. It is slriking because of 
the use of classical violin on an 
album that features mostly bone-
crunching guitar riffs. Although the 
result wasn't exactly what Rzeznik 
expected, the use of strings gives 
the music an added dimension. 

"We wanted the strings to be 
morefolky, more like fiddling rather 
than playing the violin," he said. 
"We wanted it to be Appalachian,

but it ended up sounding more 
Gypsy, but it worked." 

The Goo Goo Dolls formed in 
1986 when there wasn't much of an 
organized local scene for the band 
to thrive on, Rzeznik said. Regard-
less, the group independently re-

leased a self-titled album and has 
releasedtwoalbumssincethen, with 
Car Wash the band's most acces-
sible release. Producer Gavin 
McKillop, who has worked with 
The Church and Toad the Wet 
Sprocket, probably deserves part of 

Thursday, May 6, 1993 

the credit for the pop Sensibilities 
that come through on Superstar Car 
Wash. 

"Gavin," Rzeznik said, " has a 
very EUropeoo feel for music. He's 
very polished and very meticulous 
and very pop-oriented. 

"You know we have 00 Ameri-
coo feel for pop music, and we' re 
pretty low-key individuals, so 1 think 
he looked at us like we were a biker 
goog. We got along great, and it was 
definitely two worlds colliding in 
the recording studio." 

Car Wash has a number of solid 
rock songs dealing with broken 
dreams and disillusionment, yet the 
lyrics never become utterly cynical. 
During the interview, Rzeznik 
showed an interest in politics but 
maintained that he is more con-
cerned with writing about personal 
experiences. 

"( tend to put myself on the chop-
ping block more than society," he 
said in describing the themes of his 
songs. 

The Goo Goo Dolls play with 
The Muffs at the Pub Wednesday at 
8 p.m. For more information, call

FEST: Bands 
play thrash 
ContInued from pep HI 

The venue was divided into an 
electric main stage and an acoustic 
stage. On the main stage, bands 
played for 20 minutes while the 
acoustic bands had half an hour. 
Unfortunately, the electric bands 
were so loud that they drowned the 
sound at the acoustic stage. 

Twenty-nine groups played over 
the course of the day. Some of the 
best sets were performed by Hate 
Romance, Radio Wendy, Electric 
Love Hogs, Rust, Honey Glaze and 
Lord Byron. 

As a Miniature ended theirthrash 
session on the main stage to zero 
applause, Natasha's Ghost as-
sembled on the acoustic stage. 
Ghost uses an eclectic array of in-
struments. All of the bongos, tam-
bourines, cello, guitar, violin, bass 
anddrums helped to achieve a Celtic 
sound 

Inch started its set on the main 
stage by playing intense music that 
sounded like an angry Nirvana, but 
by the second song, the band slid 
into unintelligible thrash. 

Russell Hayden was especially 
noticeable as a skinhead with a 
distinctive playing style. During his 
performance, his face contorted and 
grew red as he played ashiny white 
guitar ferociously with flamenco 
accents. 

Burning Hands ripped up the 
Bowl with a hot performance. Lead 
singer Steve Noriega stole the show 
when he fell backward into the pit 
and was passed around by the 
crowd, but he sang without missing 
a note. 

Honey Glaze was one of the 
better promoted bands of the con-
cert. Although Honey Glaze's first 
song was excellent, the remaining 
selections could not compare. 

The Electric Love Hogs, another 
main act, blasted onto stage and 
into a performance as electrifying 
as Burning Hands. The lead singer, 
Danny Campion, looked and 
sounded at times like Axel Rose as 
he pogo-ed around the stage. 

So who won the Battle of the 
Bands? Everyone lucky enough to 

ent.

Indian Smmner 
T he moments of innocence, adventure and silly pranks that children experience in 

summer camp have been 
captured on screen before, but the 
films generally portray the 

that their present lives have not ex-
actly followed the paths they had 
envisioned in their youth. 

They arrive at Camp Tamakwa 
with a good deal of personal bag-

gage. Matthew (Vincent

Spano) is having career 
doubts, while he and his 
wife Kelly (Julie Wamer) 
facemaritaI problems.Jen-
nifer (Elizabeth Perkins) 
plays the embittered single 

camp. 
The adults are invited back by 

their original counselor, Unca Lou 
(Alan Arkin), to be residents in the 
very last session of his 43-year-old 
camp. Their week-long stay turns 
out to be a therapeutic retreat for 
everyone. By the end of the week, 
all of the eight campers and Unca 
Lou have experienced some degree 
of personal growth or "post -pubes-
cent" coming-of-age. While remi-
niscing about old times, they realize 

woman . Beth (Diane 
Lane) still grieves over the 

recent death of her husband whom 
she met at the camp, and Jack (Bill 
Paxton), who was kicked out of the 
camp as a youngster, reappears after 
a bout with alcoholism. 

Other characters also confront 
their share of difficulties. The the-
matic message is seen somewhat 
analogously through the eyes of Brad 
(Kevin Pollack), who obsesses on 
the thought that the camp now seems 
so much tinier than he remembers. 

After repeatedly commenting on its 
diminutive size, he finally realizes 
by the end of the film that the camp 
has not gotten any smaller, but that 
the child!en have grown up. 

Director Binder himself seems 
to have reached a somewhat cathar-
tic moment with Indian Summer. 
He attended Camp Tamakwa for 10 
years in his own youth, and the 
origins of the stories in the film 
connect with his personal experi-
ences. The mixture of both comical 
and dramatic events authentically 
portrays the ambience of camp.

Sam Raimi and Alan Arkin start a race in Indian Summer. 

These so-called adults still relish 
the typical pranks they pulled as 10-
year-olds. They refer to themselves 
as the "shrek" kings as they secretly 
haze one another with dirty tricks 
and practical jokes. Brad seems to 
be the main target every time. 

Brad faces everything from 
toothpaste in his bed to having his 
hand placed in a bowl of water which 
makes him urinate while sleeping. 

In addition to the antics directed 
exclusively at Brad, they partici-
pate as a group in kitchen raids 
(with a more "adult" touch ofmari-
juana and the subsequent 
munchies), swim tests and arduous 
relay races. 

The eight adults grow closer to 
one another as they release their 
individual tensions. The actors con-
vincingly depict the camp bonding

RESEARCHER~S CLAIMS ARE ABSURD 
Editor: 

Dr. Teresa Sylvina of the Salk 
Institute says in the April 26 issue 
("Animal Researchers Defend Their 
Science") that animals in research are 
treated "as good, if not better than, 
animals on the street or pets in homes. 
They are clean diseasefree (emphasis 
is mine) and well taken care of." 

I hate to belabor the obvious, but 
just how does a researcher give an 
animal cancer, heart disease, diabe-
tes, hypertension, simian AIDS, 
herpes, alcoholism and a host of other 
conditions and then persuade the fa-
cility veterinarian that the animals are 
"disease-free?" 

How can you inflict bums, cause 
hemorrhage, perform invasive ab-
dominal surgery, break bones, cause 
ocular and dermal abrasions, force-
feed drugs and alcohol, induce with-
drawal symptoms, administer elec-
tric shocks in experimental protocols 
and then get your institution's veteri-
narian to say for the record that the 
animals are "well cared for?" 

I don't care if Dr. Sylvina scrubs the 
cages till they sparkle and lets the ani-
mals sleep on heated waterbeds, it is 
absolutely absurd and false to say that 
laboratory animals in research are dis-
ease-free and well cared for. Get Real!

1hIck Accents Are 
More 1ban Annoying 
Editor: 

As a freshman at UCSD, I am 
amazed by the fact that so many of the 
professors and TAs at our great uni-
versity cannot speak fluent English. I 

READERS' 

FOHUM 
have always considered myself a pro-
gressively minded person and am not 
prejudiced in any way against those 
from different ethnic backgrounds, 
but I am sick of having to sit in a class 
in which the lecturer has an accent so 
thick, nobody can understand. 

The lack of a good English vo-
cabulary also can affect the explana-
tions that instructor gives in lecture, 
because in many cases, a carefully 
worded example leads to a better un-
derstanding of the material. 

Although the university must have 
a diverse teaching staff and take into 
account the credentials of the profes-
sors, they should also take into con-
sideration that subjects like physiol-
ogy and genetics sometimes sound 
foreign enough without an accent.

Uberals Hate PC 
Codes Too 
Editor: 

In my three years at UCSD, I can-
not count the number of times various 
writers in the Guardian have de-
nounced politically correct zealots 

STUDENT CONTACT LEIS SPECIAl. 
SEARS ,UTe 

under the blanket term "Ubenus." I 
cannot blame those people who de-
nounce PC speech, for speech codes 
have indeed been taken to ridiculous 
proportions. University codes that 
were originally intended to protect 
people from such things as death 
threats have been expanded to the 
point where one may be expelled from 
some colleges for so much as laugh-
ing at an off-color joke. 

While such idiocy has not yet oc-
curred at UCSD, one still has to tread 
so lightly here that just about any-
thing one says can be deemed offen-
sive. You can't say "frat" because it 
offends the Greeks. You can't say 
"history" because certain self-pro-
claimed experts on language (incor-
rectly) believe that this word was 
derived from the two wOJds "his" and 
"story," and that would be sexist! 

But what angers me perhaps even 
more than the speech codes them-
selves is the fact that a climate has 
been created on this campus where 
one must either conform to the PC 
dogma or risk being lumped into the 
category' of "conservatives," a label 
that is simply wrong for many of us. 

This campus' self-appointed sen-
sitivity police should go back and 
reread our constitution, in which no 
place does it state that one has the 
right nol to be offended. I wholeheart-
edly applaud their critics, but I ask 
that you refrain from calling these 
people "liberals," because the liberals 
I know, myself included, uphold 
people's right to freedom of speech, 
even if that speech is unpopular, of-
fensive, or just plain dumb.

RIIf 
Suns On Verge of 
Total Eclipse 

If the Lakers somehow manage to 
win one more game and knock off the 
heavily-favored and highly talented 
Phoenix Suns, it would rank with the 
greatest upsets in sports histo!)', right 
up there with Buster Douglas over 
Tyson, the 1980 U.S.A. Hockey Team 
and the late Jim Valvano's Wolfpack 
in '83. [t would be srunning, over-
whelming and downright miraculous. 
Here are three reasons why Dyan 
Cannon is cheering, Jack is grinning, 
the Forum is rocking and the Suns are 
one game away from an early 
vacation. 
VIade Divac YS. MedIocrIty 

When he's on. V1ade can hold his 
own against almost every center in the 
]\iBA. He can rebound, block shots 
and put the ball on the floor. When 
he's off, Divac makes Benoit 
Ben jan1in seem like a franchise player. 
Unfortunately for Phoenix, the 
motivated and focused Divac is giving 
fits to the Suns ' defense. Divac has 
shown mental and physical toughness 
and discipline over an extended period 
for the fIrst time in his career. Vlade 
even deserves an Oscar for his flop in 
Game 2. When Charles Barkley's foot 
"feU" on the Laker center, Divac not 
only grimaced in mock agony, he 
acted out a death scene that is the talk 
of Tinseltown. 
....... Worthy vs. F ..... 11me 

Let's face it. Worthy is not the 
same player he was three or four years 
ago. During the regular season, 
Worthy seemed tired, sluggish, a half-
step slow. His field goal percentage, 
among the league leaders during the 
'80's, plummeted to 42 percent. Given 
the unenviable task of guarding 
budding superstar Richard Dumas, 
most fans assumed Worthy would be 
overwhelmed. Yet somehow the 
Worthy of yesteryear has returned. 
"Big Game James" has regained the 
quick fIrst step and the extension on 
his jumper. The veteran Worthy is not 
only outplaying the explosive Dumas, 
he's schooling him. 
Randy Pfund vs. l-. ,.. 

By virtue of leading the Lakers to 
their worst record in 16 years, most 
Laker fans assumed that after Los 
Angeles quietly exited from the 
playoffs that Pfund would be PfU'ed. 
Surprise! Pfund has the Lakers 
executing the slow down, half-court 
game to near perfection. The offense 
is getting good shots, and the defense 
has frustrated Barkley and Dan 
Majerle and kept the high-powered 
Phoenix offense out of its up-tempo 
style. Pfund has the Lakers playing 
their best when it counts: in the 
playoffs. Jerry West should give 
Pfund another year - the Lakers need 
better players, not a new coach. 

The realist in me says Barkley will 
probably kill another referee, Majerle 
will find his touch, KJ. will explode; 
Vlade will tank and the Lakers will 
fall in five. No offense, Mr. Barkley, 
but for old time's sake, maybe there's 
another miracle left for the Lakers.

Sophomore Chris Miyake extended his hitting streak to 16 games, but UCSD failed to break Its nine game losing streak. 

Wily Coyotes Stop UCSD 
BASEBALL: Miyake breaks con-
secutive game hit record with 16 
By Jeff Praught 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's baseball team concluded its 1993 road 
schedule with a I 0-7 loss at San Bernardino. fmishing 
with a 3-13 road record and extending its losing streak 
to nine games. 

ThegameagainstCaiState 
San Bernardino was a dandy, 
with the fmal outcome de-
cided in the late innings. 

The Tritons bolted to a 4-
o lead in the first two innings, 
but the Coyotes soon scav-
enged a hit parade of their 
own at the plate. CSUSB's 
Jason Kraus' home run fu-
eled a four-run mIly in the 
second offUCSDstaJter Mark 
Hartmann. Aftera lone run in 
the fourth, the Coyotes added 
two more in the sixth, giving 
CSUSB a 7-4 lead. 

In the seventh, however, the Tritons got a big boost 
off the bat of junior outfielder Sean Darrock, who 
returned to the lineup after a season-long leg injury. 
Darrock rippedhisthird homeroftheseason. Danock 's 
blast off Ty DeTrinidad was a three-run shot that 
pulled the Tritons even. 

But as quickly as UCSD tied it, the Coyotes were 
able 10 retake the lead. Kurt Luhrsen came in to relieve 
Hartmann in the bottom of the seventh, and gave up a 
three-run homer to John DeLongchamp. 

The Tritons were unable to score again, giving the 
Coyotes' (26-22) the 10-7 vieto!),. San Bernardino's 

Dan McDoweII/Guart1ian 
Mark Harbnann surrendered seven runs.

DeTrinidad (6-4) got the win and Luhrsen (5-6) 
picked up the loss. 

On the bright side, Chris Miyake extended his 
hitting streak to 16 games, breaking the fonnerTriton 
record of 15 held by Bob Natal. Freshman Jason 
Aguilar also added four hits for UCSD.

Pedal Pushers Take Sixth 
CYCUNG: Men qualify for Nationals in Massachusetts 
By BrIan K. Hutto 
Staff Writer 

With miles of ground to make up, 
the eighth-ranked Triton cycling team 
charged into the WCCC Regional 
Ownpi0nWp6hcldatSDSU1astwcelc-
end dctennincd to seize the final na-
tional qualifying spoc 

The Tritons needed to beat both 
seventh-rankedÂ· University of Nevada-
Reno and sixth-seed Ua..A to move 
into the all-important national qualify-
ing sixth position. 

Jeff WinkIo' led the assault by im-
medialely attacking the 62-mile men's 
A Jamul Road Race. WinkIo' broke 
away on the first climb of the hill-ridden 
event and never looked back, winning 
by an impressive five minute margin 
over the second-place fmisher. 

"The course had 12,CXX> feet ofver-
tical climbing," said men's C-rider Joe 
Nelesen. "k was [Winkler's] type of 
course because it was real difficult He 
just dwnped everyone on the hills." 

Ian Bettinger finished fifth in the 
men's B 45-miIe race and Kale Elsley 
raced to fourth in the women's B event 

Themen'sAteamofWinkler,G1enn 
Sanders, Joe Lerner, Jason Jones and 

Nick MQC(,Ie captured fourth in the 10.1 
mile Otay Team Time Trial in a lime of 
23:55. 

The men's B team, including Ryan 
Cady, Bettinger, Tun Knudsen, Jesse 
Rosen and Joe Nelesen, raced to a fifth 
place time of 24:53. 

After the May I events, UCSD had 
successfully reeled in thevitalsixthspol 
and the next days criteriwn played right 
into the hands of the Tritons'strength. 

As expected. Winkler kept the good 
times rolling during day two, negOlia!-
ing the 3O-mile SDSU Fraternity Row 
Critcriwn speed course for a second-
place tally. 

Bettinger duplicated this feat in the 
men'sB eventfollowedclosely by Mark 
Anington in fifth. Adam Livingston 
garnered fll'St in the men's D division, 
while Karina Francis finished seventh 
in the women's A race. 

At event's end, UCSD had pr0-
duced three ornniwn winners (highest 
point-scorers for the weekend) in 
WinkIer,BettingerandLivingstoneand 
successfullyqualifaedforNationals. The 
Tritons will take their number eight 
national ranking to the event held May

Home Improvement Fails 
SCFTBALl: UCSD loses 
doubleheader to Claremont 
last weekend, 9-7 and 8-5 
By Katherine Rowe 
Guardian Reporter 

Many coaches might find a young 
team burdensome due to its inexperi-
ence anc\ inconsisitency. But for UCSD 
Softball Coach Patricia Gerckens, her 
squad's lack of experience has been 
anything but negative. Although the 
Tritonssuffered two losses to Claremont 
last week, 9-7 and 8-5, Gerckens is still 
confident about the fledgling team's 
future. 

Down 9-2 at the bottom of the sev-
enth inning of the first game, UCSD 
was by no means ready to throw in the 
towel. The Tritons mounted an offen-
sive surge that produced five runs in a 
great comeback effon. UCSD was un-
able to get any closer and Claremont 
held on for a two-run victol)'. 

Catching up is nothing new to 

EmIly Rubin and the rest of the young UCSD squad eye the future. 
Gerckens, however. "If we had one at the beginning of the season. And to 
more inning, we would've done it We Coach Gerckens. "The fact that they are 
played catch-up at the end. We tend to getting hits now is exciting." 
get stronger as later innings happen." Despitetheirlosingrecord,Gerckens 

With the two close games, UCSD is undaunted. "The win-loss record 
hasshownadefinireimprovement,scor- doesn't matter to me. What matters is 
ingtherunsnowthattheyfailedtoscore that they are improving," she said. 

UCSD Stings Hornets in Showdown 
WATERSKIINet Tritons blow away Sacrnmento State 1535-885; gallq> to Nationals 
By Gregg Wrem 
Sports Editor 

In a classic Westem showdown. the 
UCSD women's waterski team was 
faster on the draw, hooting down de-
fending regional champion Sacramento 
State at the Hornet's own invitational 
last weekend, 1535-885. 

"The women established themselves 
as the dominant team in the western 
U.S.," said As. i iant Coach Bill 
Schniderwind. "We just stomped on 
them." 

Gunslinger Alison Walmsley ledthe 
shootout for UCSD, closing out the year 

undefeated in the trick event, totaling 
690points. WaJrnsleyalso placedfourth 
in the slalom and fifth in the jump, 
helping the Tritons capture all three 
events and catapulting her atop the incli-
vidual standings. 

Walmsley's teammates fired a few 
shoes of their own. Tami Walker fm-
ishedthird in the trick,fourth in the jump 
and fifth in the slalom. Cindy Best 
spearheaded the Tritons second -
through fIfth-place sweep in the jump. 
Amy Burton was third in the jump and 
fourth in trick. 

The men weren't quite as successful 

as their partners. Led by Dave Sasse's 
fifth-place finish in the trick, UCSD 
finished third in the trick and fourth in 
the slalom and jump, good enough for 
fourth overnll. 

UCSD's combined score of 4(XX> 
points was enough to place the Tritons 
second overnll. 

Burton, Walmsley and Duane Gee 
from the men's team left for Columbia, 
South Carolina and the Collegiate All-
Stars Tournament last night The final 
event of the season, the All-Stars is a 
national tournament featuring the top 
skiers from around the country.

Torrey Pines: An

unlamiliar names slood atop Ihe leaderboard. 
Matt Nisongerwas a last minule addition 10 the 
sludent field, but guaranleed a win I( he could 
get a starting spot. He looked good-as-gold 
with an opening 72. Dru Greenhalgh missed 
an 18-inch eagle putt on 1810 finish in second 
al 81. The Legends division (staff, laculty, 
grad students, celebrities, etc.) was led by Dan 
Mulvilte who fired up a career record 79. 

slepped up 10 1/ 5 and cracked a 7-iron thai

The first ace in tournament history. Ouite a

Delending Legendschampion Ian Langdon 
tossed up Ihe low round of lhe day, a 75, to 
take over the lead with a 36 hole total o( 155. 
Past champion Mario Marin positioned him-
self for a shot at the title with a 2nd round 76. 
The studenl leader continued 10 be Matt 
Nisonger who shol 80 on a course he had 
never played before. Scott Deal grabbed

Final roundÂ· Rancho San Diego: The day 
gol off to a rough start the night belore. You 
see, Doug Dannevik was providing directions 
to the course. II turns out Doug leaves a trail 
of bread crumbs on his way to work every 
morning or he'd never find his way home. He 
had half Ihe field headed to Mexico and the 
other half to Riverside. Most (ound their way 
back to the course and made ~ to the first tee 
on time. The biggest casualty was sludent 
leader Man Nisonger. He has yel to appear. 
Rumor has it he was seen getting directions at 
a gas stalion in El Paso.
