Outreach 
Works, 
UC Says 

Report examines the 
effictiveness of academic 
preparation, though 
questions remain .. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

·In an effort to meet legislators' 
demands for accountability, the 
University of California released a 
report that its administrators say 
documents the progress its outreach 
programs have made in getting disad-
vantaged students to coUege. 

University officials are pushing 
for the state Legislature to restore 
funding for the academic prepara-
tion efforts, which would be elimi-
nated next year under Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's proposed budget. 
These include programs like TRIO 
that reach out to underprivileged stu-
dents. 

Lawmakers have long demanded 
that the university provide hard evi-
dence that its programs actually work 
and deserve funding; it's unclear if 
the report will satisfy them. 

In April 2005, a committee rep-
resenting the university, the state 
Legislature and the state Department 
of Finance recommended that the 
UC system adopt a new and more 
rigorous accountability framework 
for the p~ams. 

This new report, according to UC 
spokesman Brad Hayward, provides 
firm evidence that outreach pro-
grams not only help diversity efforts. 
but help underprivileged children 
succeed. 

"The report allows state policy 
makers to look at performance ·on 
a program-by-program basis and 
use that performance data to inform 
funding decisions for next year," 
he stated in an e-mail. "Taken as a 
whole. we believe the report shows 
a very substantial contribution these 
programs are making to impro\.ed 
educational attainment for disadvan-
taged youth in California." 

The programs. aimed mostly at 
high school" students, largely provide 
college preparatory curriculum. as 
well as training for the gauntlet of 
standardized tests required for col-
lege admission. 

However. though an improvement 
on previous data coUected by the 
university, the new report still leaves 
unanswered questions. In 2003, a 
panel of experts prepared an internal 
evaluation for UC President Robert 
C. Dynes. looking a the university's 
outreach programs. 

"UC's evaluation of its outreach 
activities has produced outcomes for 
all major programs, but does not estab-
lish unequivocal cause-and-effect reIa-
tionships," the experts stated in the

Less than a week after he was elect-
ed the A.S. vice president external by 
a slim margin, Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council Vice Chair 
Eddie Herrera has gotten a less than 
warm welcome from his future co-
workers. 

Herrera, part of Earl Warren 
CoUege senior Daniel Watts' reform-
ist Tritons United! slate, built his 
platform on overhauling the A.S. 
Council's morals and ethics. 

Herrera and Watts filed a 
California Public Records Act request

campaigning.

the students the way we should be." 

After winning his position in last 
week's elections - the lone TU! can-
didate in an executive post - Herrera 
said he was worried about collabo-
rating with executives who would 
continue the practices of the existing 
council, as many of the incoming 
councilmembers are already affiliated 
with this year's group. 

"I will not compromise my prin-
ciples," Herrera said. "I plan on pros-
ecuting student representatives who 
display malicious intent or preferen-
tial treatment. If student representa-
tives are going to act in this way, I'm 
going to make sure that they have the 
incentive not to." 

Some incoming leaders have taken 
offense to Herrera's comments, call-
ing his behavior standoffish. Vice 
President Finance-elect Conrad 
Ohashi, who currently serves as John 
Muir College Senior Senator, post-
ed several comments in response to 
Herrera's statements on the Guardian's 
online Web board. 

"There are so many things that 
this council has done that have been 
appalling," Herrera said. "We need to 
change the way we deal with moral 

"Eddie ... I just have one [piece 
of] advice to you as a fellow stu-

Student admissions

ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR • 

The University of California 
is accepting more students than 
ever. with the newest admissions 
figures showing that 5,225 more 
students were accepted to UC 
campuses than last year. 

For fall 2006, freshman 

sporn 

admissions inflated by 10.4 per-
cent. overshadowing the state 
Department of Education's pro-
jections of 3.4 percent. 

The influx of accepted students 
is merely a sign of a growing edu-
cation system, according to UCSD 
Vice Chancellor of Admissions 
and Registration Mae W. Brown. 

"It will all come down to May 
I, when the students accept or 
reject our offers," she said. "We 
do not project a large increase in 
enroUment. so a large increase in 
offers is not worrisome." 

What is worrisome, however. 
is the stagnant numbers of blacks

"Diversity has become a real 

problem at this school," Brown 
said. 

Numbers -wise, diversity

UCSD offered admissions to 335 
blacks. up by 42 frpm last year. 
In contrast, Asians saw a larger 
increase in admissions offers, with 
almost 2,000 more offers since 
last year. 

Systemwide, all racial and eth-

ber of admitted students.

Institute of the Americas 
this week ' with its Award for 
Democracy and Peace for his 
efforts in promoting both Peru's 
economic growth and commit-
me'!t to strengthening democ-
racy. 

He became the eighth Latin 
American leader to receive the 
award . Jeffrey S . Davidow, the 
head of the institute, said that 
Toledo was chosen because of 
hi s dedication to free trade and 
regional economic integration . 

Under Toledo 's leadership, 
Peru 's income from e)(ports has 
tripled since 2001 and the num-
ber of Peru vian citizens living 
in poverty has dropped from 
54 percent to 48 percent. last

Physicists Say 'No' to 
Iran Nuclear Strike 
In a harshly worded letter to 

President George W. Bush, 13 
prominent physici sts urged the 
president not to authorize the 
use of nuclear weapons against 
Iran, calling it "gravely irrespon-
sible." 

led by UCSD physicist Jorge 
Hirsch, the letter was written in 
response to the president's refus-
al to neithe r confirm nor deny

that a nuclear strike against Iran 
is being considered as a viable 
option to resolve international 
concerns over Iran's plans to 
develop nuclear technology. 

The physicists who signed the 
letter include five Nobel Prize 
laureates, three former presi -
dents of the American Physical 
Society and a winner of the 
National Medal of Science. 

Hirsch's decision to send the 
letter followed a petition he 
organized last year signed by 
more than 1,800 physicists that 
criticized U.s. nuclear policies. 

Unique Lung Defenses 
Detailed in Report 

A team of researchers from 
UCSD School of Medicine has 
discovered that special white 
blood cells located only in lung 
tissue help protect it from micro-
bial attacks, marking the discov-
ery of the first innate, organ-spe-
cific immune response. 

The special cell, called an 
alveolar macrophage, is unique 
because its activity is kept in 
check by epithelial lung cells. The 
researchers found that if the alve-
olar macrophages were alwaysjn 
battle-mode, they could damage 
the fragile microenvironments 
found in lung tissue. 

The project, which was 
supported by grants from the 
National Institutes of Health, also 
revealed that the regulation of 
the cells allows them to use their 
"killer" function, or ability to 
engulf invaders, for only a lim-
ited amount of time before being

The A.S. Council Takes On 
Genodde - But Should It? 

UC Pushes for More Outreach Money 

R igh t when it appeared that the outgoing A.s. Council had one foot out the door, the string 
of relatively uneventful meetings was 
broken with a heated debate over the 
parameters of the council's participa-
tion in debates surrounding socia1 and 
political affairs. 

Although the council has techni-
cally entered the lame-duck phase of 
its term after the election of its suc-
cessor at the end of last week, that did 
not stop passionate speeches. flam! 
tempers and even tears over a proposed 
resolution to support the Armenian 
Genocide Remembrance Week. 

Submitter Revelle College fresh -
man Hovannes Nalbondyan designed

tering agreement, his remarks did not 
sit well with everyone. 

"To say that our council shouldn:t 
handle any issues like this, I have a 
big problem with that.. President 
CIuiItopber sweeten said. "A.S. is sup-
posed to be an advocacy group.-

Another argument against voting 
on the resolution was that the coun-
cilmembers did not have the time or 
opportunity to research the background 
of the resolution, and felt unprepared 
to make a decision on it. 

"Wow!" Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Travis Silft said, as the 
debate grew more animated. "I recall 
now why I missed - skipped - all 

[the meetings 1 of the resolution to 
show council sup-
port for UCSD

cism from John

2003 evaluation. pointing out that the 
university had no way of knowing if 
the programs helped underrepresent-
ed students actually perfonn better or 
simply attracted the most motivated, 
highest-perfonning and unrepresen-
tative participants. 

In some ways, the new report, 
which showed higher achievement 
rates for pr!>8ram participants on 
multiple standardized tests, reflect-
ed the previous criticisms. 

While 61 percent of students at 
low-performing schools enrolled in 
at least one UC outreach program 
took the SAT I or ACT standardized 
admissions tests, only 29 percent of 
students at those schools who did 
not participate in the programs took 
the same tests. 

In addition, more students in 
UC outreach programs passed the 
California High School Exit Exam 
than the average for their demo-
graphic groups. Tenth graders in 
the "Puente" program, for example, 
passed the exit exam at rates of 96 
percent for the English section and 
92 percent for the math section, com-
pared to 63 percent and 61 percent, 
respectively, for all economically dis-
advantaged students statewide. 

To try to rule out other poten-
tial variables that might have been 
responsible for the increases. inde-
pendent of student participation in

outreach programs, the university 
statistically controlled for things like 
income and ethnicity. However, like 
previous data, the new report does 
not establish a clear causal relation-
ship; it's unclear whether other vari -
ables, like work ethic and personal 
drive to achieve, couJd have caused 
certain students to both participate 
in UC-run programs, and also do 
well on tests. Currently, the univer-
sity provides $12 million in its own 

funding to the programs. The pro-
grams also receive an additional $40 
million in support from the federal 
government and private sources, 
according to the report. 

While the Schwarzenegger 
administration has not yet com-
mented on the report, state budget 
spokesman H.D. Palmer previously 
said that outreach has a long way 
to go in proving its programs are a 
viable option in outreach. 

"Currently, there seems to be 
no conceivable way that we can 
concretely show th:if these pro-
grams work; Palmer said when 
Schwarzenegger's original budget 
was released. 

Legislators will rule on the fund -
ing later this summer. 

"We are proViding state policy 
makers with what they requested 
of us, so we hope they will find it 
usefuJ and compelling:' Hayward 
said. "We believe that having more 
data, on more measures of perfor-
mance, using a methodology that 
has been developed in conjunction 
with state policy makers, will cer-
tainly be helpful:'

"This is a controversial issue and 
there are two sides to it:' Kuzucan said. 
"The remembrance week is not about 
blame, but recognition:' 

"This is a very sensitive issue:' he 
.said, wiping tears from his eyes. "This 
is about people killing other pe<lple:' 

Ultimately. after objections and 
accusations flew back and forth across 
the table, the councilmembers decided 
that it was within their rights to handle 
matters of this nature. TIle amend-
ed resolution was ultimately adopt-
ed in a 10-5-2 vote. While a month 
before the end of their terms could 
be interpreted as a little late to be 
second-guessing their own mission, 
the council members did eventually 
come to a decision - one that may 
aid the new council in the difficult 
transition process as the faces filling 
the offices soon change. 

UCSD Minority, Low-Income Admits Dropping 
While many were undecided on 

the idea itself, several council members 
questioned whether or not it was the 
council's duty to make statements on 
controversial political matters. 

"I don't think 90 percent of the peo-
ple in this room know anything about 
this," Senate Chair loth MartIno said, 
drawing mixed looks from the others 
in the room. "Why now? In general, 
we make too many decisions without 
knowing what the hell is going on."

however, with only a 0.2 percent 
jump in the system. Offers to 
Asians increased at the fastest rate, 
up 1.4 percent. Meanwhile, the 
number of whites offered admis-
sion dropped 2.1 percent through-
out all the UC schools. 

Overall, underrepresented stu-
dents. which the system labels as 
black, Latino or American Indian, 
has largely increased, according to 

the university dala . 
Currently, 21.7 percent of uni-

versity admits are from underrep-
resented groups, a 20.6 percent 
jump from last year. 

However, UCSD. UCLA and UC 
Merced registered small declines 
in the number of underrepresented 
admits. 

UCSD administratiors remain 
worried about the presence of such 
groups, Brown said. 

While the school does continue 

to accept more blacks, the enroll -
ment figures have remained flat, 
she said . 

"It's a different story once we 
pass the date that students accept 
our offers," she said. "The num -
bers of blacks, Latinos and other 
underrepresented groups have been 
a puzzle that we have been trying to 
figure out for a very long time."

'Big Government' Threatens 
American Higher Education 
Two years ago, Congress considered requiring curricula of federally funded international-studies programs to pass 
the muster of the FBI and CIA, 
among other national security 
agencies. Fortunately for aca-
demic freedom, that proposal 
died. 

However, a watered-down 
version of the bill, which 
would increase scrutiny of 
these programs, is currently

Representatives as part of a larger

Needless to say, few of these 
measures would actually help 
students, and most would politi-

colleges continue to be the best 
in the world largely because they 
operate with little government

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Riley Salant-Pearce 

'Students Against the War' Protests 
Hinder Practice of Free Speech 

UC Santa Cruz's 
student organization's 
protests hypocriti-
cal and inefficient for 
achieving their cause. 

By Natasha Naraghi 
STAfF WRITER 

Militant students against peaceful recruiters - talk about role reversal. 
The roles of students and mil-

itary recruiters are not the only 
thing off balance at UC Santa Cruz, 
however. 

While it's generally true that the 
liberal slant of college campuses 
acts as a catalyst for protests against 
war and in favor of free speech, for 
UC Santa Cruz's Students Against 
the War protestors, balancing these 
opposites produces a major hypoc-
risy. 

Equally worrisome, however, is 
the inefficiency of the student orga-
nization's methods for promoting 
their anti-war attitudes in a manner 
that will allow them to bring about 
change. 

At UC Santa Cruz's April job 
fair, S.A. W. members exercised their 
right to free speech by protesting 
against the presence of military 
recruiters at the annual universi-
ty event. The Santa Cruz Sell,tinei 
reported that over 200 students 
appeared to protest at the job fair 
and were "shouting and banging on 
windows," stirring enough commo-
tion to cause the departure of the 
recruiters. 

While it was not quite the exodus 
that military recruiters might like 
people to think, their withdrawal 
from the fair exposes an idiosyn-
crasy within the protestors' anti-war 
campaign. The organization pro-
motes a personal exercise of free 
speech against a government institu-
tion, but at the same time protests 
against an exhibit of free speech by 
the same institution they oppose. 

No maner how unpopular the 
war in Iraq may be, the fallacies 
of its cause, the perils of its con-
tinuation or the hindrance on peace 
brought by its persistence, asking 
for a silent enemy would be promot-
ing an unfair and partial notion of 
free speech_ 

Sure, the majority of colle~e stu-
dents disapprove of the war, and 

rightly so, but that has very little to 
do with the righ~ of military recruit -
ers to peacefuUy bring students into 
their fold. 

Recruiters have the same right 
to wave their flags in support of 
spreading democracy abroad as a 
coUege student does to wave signs 
of disapproval for a war that con-
sumes innocent lives while fueling 
division within the p~rticipating 
countries. 

According to the 
Amendment, upheld 
Supreme Court earlier 

Solomon 
by the 

this year, 

.w. should keep 
in mind that while 

reauiters may paint 
a distorted picture of 
milltky life at war in 
glory and patriotism, 

ultimately each 
enlistee makes his 

or her own decision 
and must be held 

accOuntable?' 
univetsities that receive federal 
funding are required to permit 
military representatives to recruit 
in the same manner as all other 
company recruiters, but must allow ' 
student protests regarding military 
presence. 

In the court's decision, Chief 
Justice John Roberts wrote, ·stu; 
dents and faculty are free to associ -
ate to voice their disapproval of the 
military's message. Recruiters are, 
by definition, outsiders who come 
onto campus for the limited purpose 
of trying to hire students - not 
to become members of the school's 
expressive association." 

A recent article in the Washingto" 
Post noted that most schools simply 
are not willing to forgo their fed-
eral funding, to the tune of about 
$35 billion per year, because some 
students do not agree with the pres-
ence of military officials on their 
campus. 

While the incomplete notion of 

frcc speech weakens the platform of 
S.A.W., equally debilitating to the 
organization's cause is its misguided 
protests. 

S.A. W. should keep in mind that 
while recruiters may paint a dis-
torted picture of military life at war 
in glory and patriotism, ultimately 
each enlistee makes his or her own 
decision and must be held account-
able. 

The issue comes down to pro-
testors unknowingly misdirecting 
their energy in a manner that is 
most i!)efficient for their cause of 
reducing the number of enlisting 
persons. 

"In order to stop the war, you 
have to make it more difficult to 
wage war," said Marla Zubel, a 
member of the group. 

If protestors like Zubel want 
to make it more difficult to wage 
war, keep students out of the armed 
forces and decrease the success of 
military recruitment practices, they 
ought to educate the masses about 
the severity of the havoc, the despair 
of the casualties and the impact it 
will have on their lives. They are 
going to have to break down the 
conviction and replace it with . a 
touch of fear. 

Rather than vigorously trying to 
prevent students from having any 
contact with military recruiters, 
S.A.W. would do best to acknowl-
edge the military's presence, accept 
it and learn to bypass it by more 
creative means. 

Moreover, protestors cannot 
continue marching with the heavy 
hooves of horses, for it impede5 on 
the rights of some of their fellow 
students. whose access to a variety 
of job opportunities was hindered 
by the weighty convictions of the 
organization. 

Accordina to an article in the 
Sa" FrartCisco Chronicle, . there were 
several interested students unable to 
speak to the military recruiters on 
campus for the job fair as a result of 
the student protests. It is unfair for 
the _organization to take away the 
opportunities of others in its fisht 
against the war by acting in such a 
manner so AI to cause recruiters to 
leave the school. 

In order to be effective at all, 
the protestors are aoina to have to 
balance free speech with anti-war 
sentiments and are best off doing so 
by educating rather than fishtina. 

Ultimately, it's. balancing act.

A New Age Is Here 
O n the final morning of the postmodern era, I awoke to a ringing telephone. A par-
ent calling from work, smothering 
the receiver with 
gruff paranoia: 
"Get up and turn 
the TV on and get 
all the cars full of 
gas. They've shut 
down all the air-
ports. Someone 
flew a plane into 
the World Trade Center." 

Stories of that Tuesday morning 
will open countless books for the 
next 100 years as countless histori-
ans, politicians, novelists, social crit-
ics, essayists and terrorists recall the 
few hours that introduced life in the 
new era. That crucial ingredient and 
its aftermath - international insecu-
rity as it feels after a smoldering hole 
replaced the World Trade Center 
complex - rang in the age where the 
possibility of mortal, p.olitical and 
social doomsday always lurks just a 
breaking news update away. While 
we're too close to see it fully now, 
thinkers in the future will describe 
Sept. 11 ·as the symbolic end of the 
modern and postmodern, 20th cen-
tury-chapter of human social rela-
tions, and the beginning of a new, 
as-yet-unnamed period where the 
tiring pace and bewildering frac -
tures of those ages are replaced by an 
insecurity so pervasive it focuses our 
life on the single moment as never 
before. 

To understand how differently we 
will live now, we have to get a sense 
of how people lived in the past, and 
how quickly everything changed. 
Before industrialization drew people 
out of the rural communities they'd 
occupied for hundreds of years, peo-
ple were able to count on things 
being pretty muchJhe same tomor-
row as they were today. The serfs 

would always be at the bottom, and 
the rulers always at the top. Social 
norms would go unspoken, and thus 
unchallenged. Authority was handed 

Lines in

down from God 
through the King 
and the Church 
- and whatever 
mythical sense 
they made of the 
world more or 
less automatically 
became every-

one's interpretation. 
Science and industrial technol-

ogy changed all that very quickly. 
The move to cities, factories and, 
a wage-based labor force brought 
new uncertainty to human life in 
the places it occurred - suddenly, 
everything (social norms, centers of 
authority, styles of expression) could 
and did change. Towering metropo-
lises isolated the individual man in 
a sea of strange faces, an unfathom-
ably alienating experience for people 
who'd grown up knowing everyone 
in their village. Art gave up rep-
resenting things traditionally and 
became obsessed with structure and 
its medium. Technology like radio 
and, later, television, broadcast the 
same experience to thousands, help-
ing to create a popular culture. People 
generally felt like things were gradu-
ally changing toward something, that 
technology would somehow relieve 
them of the worst burdens of life. 

The death of that rational ideal-
ism, of the faith in the modern age's 
narratives of progress and improve: 
ment, marks what some call the 
post modern, the era into which we 
were born. Constant change became 
the norm. Media and the milieu of 
its performance (now inescapable 
as images became the ubiquitous 
standard of communication) played 
always out of order, disconnected, 
jumping from one time and place to

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINIONS 

Welcome to the Perpetual Horizon 
another. The authoritarian, progr~s­
sive culture was shattered by a chaot-
ic one, where villians became heroes 
and the sharpest irony became the 
highest chic. 

Suburban development and the 
break-up of the traditional city exac-
erbated our social isolation from 
each other as marathon freeway coni-
mutes became commonplace. The 

Stories of that 
esday morning 

[Sept. 11] will open 
coundess books for 
the next 100 years as 
coundess historians, 
politicians, novelists, 
social critics, essayists 
and terrorists recall 
the few hours that 

introduced life in the 
new era." 

communities they created resembled 
the bricolage of TV channel surfing: 
unconsidered, obsessed with the 
superficial, lacking order. 

Authenticity, as it meant in the 
pre- and fl10dern eras, evaporated 
as the speeding up of life canceled 
patience for - depth and nuance. 
Attention spans were replaced by 
a fascination with deliberately con-
structed, self-referential, instant 
reality: Las Vegas, Hot Topic, MTV. 

But while much ballyhoo was 
devoted to the rise of the sound byte 

in the post modern era, that's noth-
ing like what we are going through. 
According to the New York Times, 
Americans are in such a rush that we 
can't even wait to order our drive-
thru food from a nearby person -
McDonal-d's is experimenting with 
a system where orders are beamed 
from the restaurant to a call center 
where trained receptionists take calls 
at blazing speed, then zap orders 
back to the kitchen of the original 
restaurant. It only saves a few sec-
onds, but in our age, a few seconds 
can mean everything - and hot fries 
with it. 

It means billions for the technol-
ogy industry, who roll out ever-new 
consumer products with the promise 
of saving a few clicks off that video 
download. It meant life for a few 
Londoners last summer, running just 
late enough to miss the tube train 
that al -Qaeda blew up (How often 
do you, running late, agonize over 
the seconds it takes for that Buick 
driver to awaken and realize the 
light's turned green?) 

Like the postmodern and mod-
ern before it, the changes of the new 
age can't be seen as all good or bad 
- it's both. Technology has largely 
dismissed traditional authority and 
retied some of the bonds to our fel -
low man, although not in the ways 
that anyone expected. We can talk 
all we want to strangers and friends 
through digital technology, but do 
we know them as well? Then again, 
is there as much to know? Do we not 
try, with varying degrees of intention 
and success, to brand ourselves to 
be increasingly easily decipherable 
for potential consumers of us? Is 
that not the point of fashion - to 
be a Cliff's Notes for choosing with 
whom you'll socialize? 

Then there are the disasters, which 
seem to arrive with the frequency of 
. new message beeps in online chat. 

Think of how they've come: War 
in one country, then another, lack 
of justification notwithstandi ng, 
the casualties countless. A massive 
wave washes away hundreds of thou-
sands of people. Genocide slaughters 
another few hundred thousand; no 
countries intervene. A titanic hur-
ricane inundates a major city, killing 
thousands more. 

The scale, in addition to the 
frequency, is horrifying, especially 
if you start thinking of potentials: 
Will Iran nuke Israel? Will global 
warming drown civilization? Will 
the United States elecr another 
Republican president? 

We never know what will happen 
next, which makes the idea that we're 
moving toward something, especia lly 
something better, hard to hold on to: 
The president doesn't tell the truth 
and neither do any other leaders; the 
poor are getting poorer; the institu-
tions and norms our parents counted 
on are failing. 

Yet we're free to consume (for 
now) as never before, with most 
of the world's working force tuned 
into a hyperefficient shit -making 
machine from which First World 
consumers can purchase goods for 
the pleasure of defining and redefin-
ing themselves. 

Despite the admitted vagueness 
of this explanation (give me a book), 
a new uncertainty - the age where 
all of life revolves on the digital sec-
ond - seems to have been kicked off 
(thematically, not technologically) on 
Sept. 11, where cell-phones conveyed 
the mortal jeopardy of thousands 
with harrowing frankness. Insecurity 
- economic, social, political, moral 
- is now perperual. Instant com-
munication turns every tick into a 
horizon of change on a scal~ never 
experienced by humankind - so be 
ready the next morning you wake to 
a ringing phone .

MAGNER, Joe, Acton, MA 
It is with great sadness that we mark the 
possing of Joe Magner's game. A game 
once respected. for its ability ta overcome 
great resislance. It was in Ihe process of 
doing just that; charmingly dismantling 
the defenses of a bubbly blonde serority 
girl, when Joe turned and saw someane 
beside them, intently watching their 
conversetion . Alas, this persan was 
a Gomekiller, and none other than 
the over~vcated , pseudo academic, 
knower of everything, known as IQ . 
The Gomekiller whose sole pleasure in 
life is using his enormous brainpower 
to extricate girls jusl like Joe's. And so 
il was that IQ quickly and seomlessly 
steered the conversation to the dilemma 
of quaSi existentialism. Joe asked if the 
conversation was for real. Selling.himself 
up for on intellectual pummeling. By the 
lime Joe hod finished struggling 10 hold 
onto IQ's tra in of thought, he had lost his 
hold on the girl. Natura non conlrislatur. 
Joe. Natura non contristalur. 

THEODOIE, Rashid, N.w York, NY 
Were it not seen by many a witness 01 
the club, the death of Rashid's game 
would remain a mystery befitting one 
of the many crime scene investigators 
portrayed nighriy on television sels . For 
it is a generally accepted truth that 
when men get off to a great start with 
a girl 01 a club, they soon expect10 find 
them.selves suavely working that woman's 
torso into a tangle on the dance floor. 
(W ith porticular attention paid to the 
rubbing of the palms, the elbows, and 
of course the occasional posterior.) But, 
Rashid's case was peculiar, and no 
matter how fluid his conversational Row 
was flOWing , his game saw no moment 
towards the aforementioned dancing 
routine, masl especially as il pertained to 

the absence of any posteri~r·knocking . 
Inslead, Rashid's spicy prospect was 
beginning to show classic signs of 
eye-drih and to none other than , Man 

C~ndy, the 'sugar-sweet confection of 
a Gomekiller revered far his talents at 
topping cherries like Rashid's lady-friend. 
And indeed, another game met its demise, 
as it is also a generally occepted rule 
amongst women that candy is the truest 
way to a woman's heart.

the future hall-of-famer himself, The Baller.

The Baller's play for his girl w ith a simple 
pump fake 10 the bar and a dRve 10 the 
Shorleece lane, but instead he got caught 
in The Baller fuli-court trap; And before 
he knew it, Tider and th~ Baller were

'Dreamz' Lampoons 'American Idol,' Terrorists and a Hapless President 
By Marianne Madden 

SENIOR STAFF WRI TER 

merican Idol" is not just a crappy 
TV how - it's a phenomenon 
that's seeped way beyond the 

widest big screen. Anyone who's deri-
sively wailed Kelly Clarkson songs 
or imitated Simon Cowell's churlish 
insults knows the show is ripe for rid-
icule. So how can us intelligent folks 
enjoy "Idol" without the guilt? Enter 
''American Dreamz" - a fictional TV 
show that just so happens to mirror a 
certain real one. 

Hugh Grant plays Martin Tweed, 
a composite of Ryan Seacrest and 
Si mon Cowell, talking with Cowell's 
accent and strutting around in 
Scacrest's trendy shirts and gelled 
hai r. His portrayal of a megalo-
maniac with severe insecurities is 
deliciously grating; his various small 
crises of identity are highly satisfy-
ing. 

A tanned and golden Mandy 
Moore bubbles over as Sally, a cute 
but cunning "American Dreamz" 
contestant gunning for the top spot. 
"American Idol" isn't about the 
singing, and "Dream..... isn't either 
- almost a shame, because the musi-

Rated PG-13 

cal numbers are a riot. Moore's voice 
sounds beautiful - too good for a 
televised competition, really. 

Equally enjoyable are the song 
and dance numbers of Orner, a wide-
eyed terrorist recruit sent from the 
Middle East ' to live with clueless 
relMives in Orange County, who is 
accidentally selected for the show 
when his cousin Iqbal leaves the 
house at the wrong time and a TV 
crew overhears Orner singing show 
tunes in the basement. Flamboyantly 
gay Iqbal (played brilliantly by Tony 
¥aIda), who has a taste for sequins, 
streamers and jazz fingers, coaches 
Omer - whose campy showman-
ship brings him head-to-head with 
Sally in the final. Omer elicits the 
same forehead -slapping as William 
Hung, but has none of his tone-
deafness. Sally, though, is a ruth-
less competitor, even exploiting her 
dog-eyed military boyfriend (Chris 
Klein) to endear herself to the vot-
ing ma sses. 

Meanwhile, President Staton 
(Dennis Quaid) elbows his way into 
th e narrative from time to time. Is 
it a surprise that this presidential 
figure i hopelessly clueless without 
the constant input of his vice presi-
dent (Willem Dafoe, sporting Dick 
Cheney's glasses and halo of white 
hair), or that his wife (Marcia Gay 
Harden) affects a soothing Southern 
accent and talks to him like he's 
a puppy? It's clearly meant as an 
indictment of President Bush's pub-
lic stutterings and aversion to re2d-

ing newspapers, but it's too literal 
to succeed. 

Lampooning the presidency is easy; 
but lampooning it well is much harder. 
"Idol" is such a huge institution, paro-
dying it and it only would have made 
for an excellent 90 minutes. 

But the movie takes on too much 
when it attempts to show us every-
thing wrong with America. Yes, it's 
funny to watch the president dis-
cussing anti-depressant doses with 
his wife or stroking a projection of 
the American flag, but it belongs in 
another movie. 

"Dreamz" also misses an oppor-
tunity to lampoon the bizarre and 
fascinating chemistry of American 
Idol's three judges, t.hough the 
Seacrest -Cowell composite of 
Martin Tweed is everywhere, and 
fun to hate. Tweed is not QIlly a 
lecher (he and Moore's character 
share the sexual chemistry that 
only two megalomaniacs can find), 
but he's the cruel puppetmaster 
of "Dreamz." "I want .. . an Arab;' 
he says, while selecting the show's 
finali sts. Much of the movie is built 
on the absurd collision of terrorism 
and live television, and it's daring to 
have Orner, a terrorist sleeper cell, 
as the most lovable character in the 
entire movie. 

But writer and director Paul 
Weitz ("About a Boy" and "American 
Pie") fails to realize that viewers will 
look to "Dreamz" for the same rea-
son they love "Idol" - the glitz, the 
glamour, the schadenfreude of disas --

The Ironman Adds Another Page to the Wu-Tang Manual 
By Adam Staley 

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Thirteen years after Wu-Tang Clan debuted with 36 Chambers, only scattered fragments of the 
original nine members remain. The 
untimely passing of ODB along with 
the usual difficulties that emerge 
when an entire group has to share 
the same spotlight have led to the dis-
solution of the pre-eminent group in 
hip-hop history, with Iron Flag as the 
final, disappointing chapter. 

Ghostface KilIah, however, con-
tinues to carry the Wu-Tang torch, 
allowing the grimy Wu sound to 
evolve into a more polished style, 
while still maintaining the original-
ity for which Wu has always been 
renowned. Long-time Clan fans may 
initially be disappointed to see a total 
lack of RZA production on KiIlah's 
Fishscale, but the deviation from his 
first producer is a natural result of the 
differing paths traveled by all nine 
members. In fact, the wide range of 
producers used provides a perfect 
backdrop for KiIlah's usual tales of 
drug deals gone wrong. growing up 
in poverty and difficulties with the 
fairer sex. 

Top-notch producers lust Blaze, 
M F Doom and the late I DiUa all grace 
the production credits of Fishscale, 
but it is the number-one soul brother 
Pete Rock who shines the brightest 
with his beats for "R.A.G.U." "Be 
Easy" and "Dogs of War:' Rock's typi-
cal soul-based production is the per-
fect compliment to Killah's passionate 
lyrics, and "R.A.G.U.," which fea-
tures Clan member Raekwon, stays 
so true to the Wu -Tang sound that 
the track could se-amlessly be slipped 
into Cuban Linx. 

Doom also offers his vision of 
the Wu sound for the 21st cen-
tury with his dusty piano loop on 
"9 Milli Bros.; a track featuring 
verses from nearly the entire Clan 
(the unappreciated Inspectah Deck 
is excluded). Unfortunately, Doom 
misses the mark just as much as 
he hits it: "Clips.e of Doom" and 
"Jellyfish" rely on electric guitar and 
organ samples, respectively, that are 
repetitive, uninspired and simply 

obnoxious. 
The other problem with the album 

is the inclusion of unnecessary skits, 
particularly the juvenile and ' rather 
immature "Heart Street Directions." 
As a result of this superfluous mate-
rial, beautifuJly produced tracks such 
as "Crack Spot" and "Barbershop:' in 
which Killah plays a cu tomer whose 
hair is ruined by a barber more con-
cerned with chatting than actually 
cutting hair, are relegated to mere 90-
Second spots. 

These flaws, however, are few and 
far between - the biggest problem is 
that at some point the album has to 
stop. An album as highly anticipated as 
this one often disappOints due to raised 
expectations, but Killah not only meets 

Now I 
KrlOW w hi

or3CU"c.

these expectations, he surpasses them; 
it is on Fishscale that he fully realizes 
his potential as not just the symbolic 
leader of Wu-Tang, but of New York 
hip-hop as a whole. Killah already had 
a coUection of solo albums worthy 
of any hip-hop head's attention, but 
Fishscale, his fifth solo effort, should 
catapult KiJlah into the upper echelon 
of MCs, those whose catalogs speak for 
themselves. He wiU be remembered as 
one of the best.

'Scholl' Breaks Old Ground With Nazi Horro,r Story 

COURTESY OF ZEITGEIST FILMS 
Sophie'. Choice: Julia Jentsch plays Sophie Scholl in the Academy Award-nominated film about one woman's stance against Nazism. 

By Adam Keleman 
STAFF WRITFR 

Sophie SchoU has a lot going for her: She's cute, young, German and battling a Na7j government 
at every turn. What's not to like? 
Maybe it's the movie itself that's not so 
becoming. "Sophie SchoU: The Final 
Days" lurches forward with radical 
thought from the Nazi era, including 
a few obligatory jabs at America, but 
it doesn't quite hake up the system 
- theirs or ours. 

Beginning in a race against time 
like an action · movie - minus the 
fun - SchoU (Julia Jentsch) and her 
friends work fast to print pamphlets 
to distribute at the local university. 
This cause is urgent, since, you know, 
this is that bleak period in German 
history called the Third Reich, and 
Scholl is part of an underground 
movement known as the White Rose. 
They don't like Nazis very much -
mainly because of censorship - but 
maybe also the regime's murderous 

tactics. 
This day is not such a good one 

for Scholl and her brother, who is 
also part of the White Rose. They 
are caught red-handed and shipped 
off to prison, where SchoU and her 
brother are separated and vigorously 
questioned about their radical beliefs. 
The rest of "Final Days" goes some-
thing like this: War bad! Justice good! 
Suffering intolerable! Nazis bad!!! 

Director Marc Rothemund stages 
the film like a standoff between Nazi 
pigs and the righteous Scholl. She 
spends days facing interrogation in 
one of those damp, gray question-
ing rooms you see in movies all the 
time. Words are tossed back and forth 
about precious life and fascist govern-
ments and the Fuhrer. Is it really time 
for another Nazi wankfest? 

"Final Days" is plainly too pol-
ished. It is full of nice, morose light-
ing to emphasize her sorrow, and a 
galloping score to predicate her spirit. 
Is this a movie about Nazi injustice 
or what? The content is at least new: 

B.TYLB .FILE 

We don't often hear about the true 
story of this fallen heroine of war-
torn Germany, and Jentsch does a 
more than admirable job in the role. 
But please, no morc Nazi film for a 
long while. 

Yes, there is some insight in this 
long-winded talk-fest about all the 
dos and don'ts of immoral Nazi war-
fare, and every now and then a lesson 
is learned a it pokes its head lip from 
underneath the laboriou dialogue. 
But should.n't film be about real expe-
riences instead of rhetoric? 

The Germans may have impris-
oned and killed Scholl, but her 
rebellious words still live on in this 
movie - that is, if they don't bore 
you to death in the meantime.

'Page' Exposes the Legendary Sex 
Icon With Salacious Charm 
~ BETTIE, from page 8 
was a good Christian, even when she 
posed in the nude. As she put it, in her 
pert Southern accent, "Adam and Eve 
didn't put on clothes until after they 
sinned:' And although she made a liv-
ing at exposing her flesh, Page drank 
orange juice, not martinis, and stayed 
in monoganlOus relationships. 

Page wasn't a sharp wit , but the 
film never looks down on her; instead 
it embraces her naive nature. When 
one photographer asked how she felt 
about making dirty fUms, she replied, 
"Dh, I enjoy acting very much:' 

It's ironic that such a sweet thing 

as Page would set off a firestorm, yet 
Page's photos with whips and chains 
launched a U.S. Senate investigation 
into pornography. David trathairn 
shows. up as Sen. E-stes Kefauver - a 
lawmaker hell -bent on demonizing 
pornographer . It is clear Ihat Harron 
is trying to draw parallels from the 
conservative politicians of the '50s era 
to some of today's righteous policy-
makers, but as a message film, "Page" 
is weak. Its originality is as a biopic 
about a simple girl who didn't cure 
cancer, or write really good country 
music. She just took her clothes off, 
with a little charm. 

Goya's Portraits of the Snooty Spanish 
Contrast With His Anti-War Artwork 

By Kaveh Keshmiri 
S~NIOR STMF WRI TER 

Art enthusiasts now have the opportunity to glimp e into the faces of the late 18th century from 
Fran i co Goya's position as royal court 
painter of the Spanish monarchy. In 
collaboration with the Museo Nacional 
de Arte in Mexico ity, the San Diego 
Museum of Art presents an exhibition 
of Spain's most prolific painter with a 
coUection of his still-life portraits and 
a smaller as ortment of etchings. 

The exhibit features two separate 
aspects of the artist's work. One is the 
highly advertised showcase of Goya's 
take on Spanish society through the 
portraits of various representative 
subjects. Drawing from the ranks 
of aristocratic, religious and com-
mercial figures, Goya presents each 
colorful image with a shade of con-
trasting solemnity ' and detail. The 
images include the cold and austere 
"Portrait ofthe Marquis of Sofraga," a 
heavily decorated general staring past 

the artist and the spectator with the 
glance of condescending superiority. 
Goya depicts the distinctly human 
features of the "noble" Spanish char-
acter, encapsulated in hi s nation's 
tumultuous struggle for economic 
and political prominence. Through 
these subject paintings, Goya cap-
tures the time and appearance of the 
upper echelons of Spanish society 
with an uncompromisi ng style that 
interprets the well-fed figures with 
an air of uncertainty, snobbery and 
vulnerability. 

The museum also include a 
collection of his anti-war etch-
ings, "Di asters of War." The draw-
ings were made in reproach of the 
Peninsular War between Spain and 
Napoleon's armies. Away from the 
portraitures, the drawings showcase 
the dissipated faces and Villages of 
common, rural folk distraught by the 
haunting effects of war. 

"Goyas Portraits" is on display 
through June 8 at the San Diego 
Museum of Art in Balboa Park.

Matisyahu 
• Youth 
SOllY 

*~ 

OK, let's just lay one thing on the table. Matisyahu is cool, in that impossibly uncool sort of way. Pirst a FM 94.9-style novelty, he gained recognition with 
airplay of his concert album "Live at Stubbs; back in the 
good 01' days when just being a Hasidic Jewish reggae 
artist was enough to vault you into the spotlight. But 
before we get too carried away, lefs remember that he is 
from New York, which shouldn·t matter, but kinda does 
anyway. 

Following his modest pop radio success attaining 
top-40 airplay comes his major label studio debut. Youth. 
Novelty, it turns out. only goes so far; on Youth , it wears 
off fast. The album can't quite be called reggae - nearly 
half the album ditches the reggae beat entirely in favor 
of fluffy pop beats almost worthy of a mediocre Shaggy 
album. "What I'm Fighting For" sounds like a bad Tracy 
Chapman cover. 

MATlSYAHU 
• I t I 

When Matisyahu does play "reggae," he does it the way 
the Black Eyed Peas do "rap· - "King Without a Crown; 
the album's best track, seems tailor-made for pop radio 
(but it doesn't match the energy of the live version). 

The key obstacle that Matisyahu·s religion poses to 
his reggae success isn't that he can't touch a woman until 
marriage (he's not a rapper, after all), but that his music 
lacks the cannabis-infused lethargy that makes even the 
most upbeat reggae relaxing. As such, all of his reggae 
t racks are plagued by an excessive spunk that doesn't 
mesh with his nearly comical vocal style. The mushy 
guitar solos scattered throughout the album only make 
matters worse, temporarily turning his songs into cas-
trated Sublime tributes. 

Smoke a blunt. Matisyahu, and then we'll talk. 
- Riley Salant-Pearce

The Vines 
• Vision Valley 
CAPITOL 

**~ 
Craig Nicholls, the lead singer of the Vines, is known for two things: engaging in highly erratic behav-ior and consuming an extraordinary amount of 
marijuana. The former arises mostly from the fact that 
Nicholls has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism 
(he was diagnosed in November of 2004, the same year 
the Aussies canceled their U.S. tour with Incubus and 
bassist Patrick Matthews left the band). To observe the 
latter, simply listen to the Vines' music. 

When considered in terms of a smoke-out debut, 
Highly Evolved is like the initial intake suffused with raw, 
unfiltered energy; follow-up Winning DAYS is the high 
itself marked with an eclectic set of euphoric emotions. 
surrealistic sounds and moments of crude aggreSSion; 
and Vision VAlley is the blase, more lackluster ending 
that still contains some of the initial vigor - but, for 
the most part. the pote.ncy is diminished and the effect 
is'less intense. 

Volunteers Needed for 
Sleep Studies 

The Vines still display a penchant for soothing melo-
dies in slow ballad "Spaceship:' the downer title track and 
the sluggish (but pretty) "Take Me Back." However, none 
of these are as good as "Winning Days" and "Homesick; 
with their intricate compositions of slow-to-fast tempos 
and forlorn vocals perfectly balanced with rhythmic gui-
tars and fitting background wails. 

The quicker fare displays decent riffs and composed 
Beatlesque yells, but the band isn·t nearly as rambunc-
tious as on past singles like -Get Free." The Vines show 
promise on -Candy Daze; an upbeat ditty that's fun and 
laid back. IIld "Don't Listen to the Radio," an infectious 
clap-along with a strong pulsating guitar, but despite 
these moments of growth. the Vines mostly stick to a 
tested formula. 

Unfortunately, it's starting to wilt. 
- Ania Dylcwslca

Hockey Gaining Respect With Top Finish 
• HOCKEY, from page 16 

Though the loss was brutal, the 
Tritons felt a sense of pride for 
making it as far as they did and 
faCing such high-caliber teams in 
comparison to their regional oppo-
nents. Not being able to practice the 
skills and endurance necessary to 
face the national teams with local 
games made it all the more difficult 
for UCSD. 

"The competition was definitely 
a step up," Ewing said. "Every team . 
was as good or better than the best 
teams we had matched up against 
during the season, so we had to 
play our best at all times. There was 
never a time we could slack off." 

Keefe also sensed a direct 
improvement in the team from the 
year before. 

"Last year, we were out in the 
first round; this year we made it 
through the second round, and next 
year we will go even further; he 
said. "We were definitely top four 
from what we saw, we just didn't pull 
it together in the playoff game. We 

are losing one senior. Ryan Fisher, 
but the core of our team is sopho-
mores and we got some new fresh-
man who have really been picking it 
up on their game so it will only go 
up from here." 

A championship hockey title 
seems on the horizon, and more 
importantly. according to the 
Tritons, respect in the hockey com-
munity is also forthcoming. 

"We are still a young team," 
sophomore Robin Fago said. "But . 
we proved to everyone that we are 
a serious team and deftnitely pose a 
threat to the next championship." 

One element the Tritons hope 
will contribute to deeper play in 
championships next season is bring-
ing in a coach, instead of being stu -
dent-run. Keefe. the captain, admit-
ted that he struggled in the position. 
feeling the rifts that it caused in the 
team miglit've been remedied by an 
authority figure. 

"We need someone older, a man 
of more respect; Keefe said. "A 
coach will be able to see things 

during games that captains can't 
because we are also trying to focus 
on our own game. It's too hard to be 
a coach and a friend, to hold their 
respect and obedience and be at 
their level at the same time because 
each requires different components 
and I just can't do it alI'-

The season was full of highs and 
lows that only served to build stron-
ger foundations for a better tealn 
to come. 

Keefe, arguably the most fit to 
represent the team. sums up the 
Tritons' development with a recent 
memory following their loss to 
Brockport. 

"Eve'ryone seemed to realize how 
far we had come; he said. ·We had 
not expected to be so up to par with 
the teams we faced, since most of 
our players had never played in such 
a high quality tournament. Nobody 
was blaming anyone for the loss,. we 
were all just there for each other. 
When we messed up. we messed 
up as a team, and when we won, we 
won as a team." 

Predictions Clear Eastern Conference Fog 
• PLAYOffS, from pa ge 1 6 
quest for a championship away from 
·L.A. as the Miami Heat play the 
upstart Chicago Bulls. Ben Gordon 
is just one young Bulls star among 
many and they will be a hand -
ful for the aging Heat. There's no 
doubt that Miami is going to win the 
series, but the number of games it 
will take depends on how dominant 
O'Neal is. In the end, Dwayne Wade 
and O' Neal will challenge them-
selves and take the series in five. 

Nets YI. Pacers 
Although I like Jermaine O'Neal's 

versatile game, I don't know how 
healthy he really is and the New 

Jersey Nets are playing too well right 
now to be messed with. The Indiana 
Pacers do have some history with 
the Nets. so I will give them two 
games, as New Jersey wi'ns in six. 

Cavaliers vs. Wizards 
I think the matchup between No. 

4 Cleveland and No. 5 Washington 
is the most interesting in the Eastern 
Conference. LeBron James is mak-
ing his debut in the playoffs and 
was playing like an MVP before 
his ankle injury. He is one of those 
special players that malc.e it hard 
to pick against, but I really like the 
Washington team. First, it has expe-
rience on its side and knows what it 

takes to playa physical series. The 
Wizards also have Gilbert Arenas, 
who has been playing almost as 
well as James and has the help of 
Antawn Jamison and Caron Butler. 
Although it's very possible for James 
to dominate this series and lead his 
team to tbe second round, I'm going 
with another up'set as the Wizards 
beat the Cavs, 4-3. 

Overall, the playoffs sound a lot 
better than last year·s. With Kobe. 
LeBron. Shaq and "Flash" all in the 
playoffs. the stage is set for these 
stars to shine. It's which stars shine 
brightest that make the playoffs 
interesting. 

Durket Shows Command In First Start 
• BASEBALL, from page 16 
where around the plate and he gave it 
to me and I was ready to jump on it:' 

Gomez was in the middle of 
another Significant Triton rally in the 
fifth inning as his single put runners 
on first and third with one out. One 
out later. Bryan Silverman doubled 
to right-center field and drove in 
two runs, including Gomez, for a 
7-0 lead. 

Point Loma Nazarene would g~ 
on to score two meaningless runs off 
the UCSD bullpen in the sixth and 
seventh innings off Michael Kearney 
to pull within five runs. However, 
scoreless eight and ni nth innings 0 
from Ryan Leake and Todd Gimenez, 
respectively. shut the door on the Sea 
Lions and gave the Tritons their 25th 
overall win and Durket his first win 
as a ·starter. 

Durket's emergence as a force Gn 
the mound gives UCSD head coach 
Dan O'Brien a dilemma about what 

to do with the young pitch·er. 
"It was an outstanding start and 

we wouldn't be doing our job if we 
weren't conSidering putting him in 
the rotation based on what we saw 
today," O'Brien said. 

Durket will have some suppon· 
ers in his push toward the rota-
tion, including Morehead. who was 
impressed with the freshman's per-
formance: 

"He had pitched weU before so we 
were pretty confident in his abilities 
as a pitcher," Morehead said. "So this 
was really his first opportunity. being 
a freshman and coming into a veteran 
rotation, to get a start. And he took 
advantage of it and pitched well." 

The Tritons could use a fresh 
addition to their rotation as they 
head into the home stretch of the sea-
son, when they play 12 of their next 
13 games against CCAA opponents 
before the CCAA Tournament begins 
on May) I. Besides an April 2S meet-

ing with Grand Canyon University 
at UCSD, the Tritons will play three 
four-game series against CCAA com-
petition. The team will face Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on the road for two 
games before hosting them for anoth· 
er two April 20 to 22. The Tritons 
will then face San Francisco State 
University for four games on the road 
before closing out their season with a 
series against Cal State Monterey Bay 
at home May 5 to 7. 

According to Morehead, for 
the Tritons to succeed in the home 
stretch, all they need to do is play like 
they did against the Sea Lions. 

-1bis Point Lorna game was the 
type of baseball we need to play," he 
said. ·We did everything weD; we 
hit the balI, we pitched, we played 
defense as well. With those three 
things, its going to be; really tough 
for another team to be able to beat us 
because we are extmnely solid in all 
three areas of the game."

Fate of NBA Playoff Teams 
Lie In Hands of One Fanatic 
Texans will have much 
to cheer about, but the 
sun will set early in 
Phoenix at the hands 
of a dominant Kobe. 

The drama in sports is what draws in fan interest and there is no more drama in 
sports than during the playoffs. 
After the dramatics surrounding 
Ron Artest, Kobe Bryant, LeBron 
James and the other NBA superstars 
during the regular season, I can't 
wait to see what . 

ers. Elton Brand has made quite an 
impact on 'he Clippers and I love 
what. Chris Kaman does for Los 
Angeles as a big center that can 
do some work in the paint. The 
Clippers are trying to make it sound 
like they're the underdogs, out in 
reality, they have the better record 
and home court advantage - and 
that means that they're the favorites. 
I don't want to predict against the 
Clippers, but in my gut, I feel that 
Denver's star Carmelo Anthony is 
too hungry to advance in the play-
offs and with the help of a healthy 
Marcus Camby and Kenyon Martin, 

Paul Choi 

the Nuggets will 
win the series 4-
3. 
Laker. VI. Sun. 

Finally, Kobe 
Bryant is back 

goes down in the 
first round. Since 
tipoff is days 
away, the only way 
to bide my time 
until the playoffs 
is by sharing my 

wkchoi CPucsd.ed'u in the playoffs as 
his Los Angeles 

predictions with the world or 
the small demographic of Guardian 
Sports readers. 

Western Cort/ermce 
Kings VI. Spun 

The Sacramento Kings have been 
playing well wit.h the addition of 
Ron Artes!. Their defense has got-
ten tough, while Mike Bibby and 
Brad Miller continue to play well 
with Artest offensively. Normally: 
these Kings would be scary to face in 
the first round, but they're matched 
up with the defending champions, 
San Antonio Spurs. I don't think 
the Spurs are intimidated by Artest, 
and they baSically do everything 
better than Sacramento. They have 
size, speed, scoring, defense, depth, 
teamwork and a good coach in Greg 
Popovich. The Kings will most like-
ly put up some sort of fight, but the 
Spurs will win in five games. 

Mavericks VI. Grizzlies 
Even though the Dallas Mavericks 

have the second-best record in the 
West, they are the No. 4 seed playing 
the No. 5 Memphis Grizzlies. Pau 
Gasol has really grown as a player 
and stands out as the leader of t.he 
Grizzlies, but there's no chance he 
will defeat the Mavs in a series. 
Memphis might win a game, but I 
have my doubts and I'm expecting a 
Dallas sweep. 

Clippen VS. Nugeta 
When the Los Angeles Clippers 

host the Denver Nuggets, the game 
will come down to the impact play-

Lakers play the Phoenix Suns. 
Phoenix's run-and-gun style will 
cause some problems for the Lakers, 
but head coach Phil Jackson will 
figure out a way to slow the pace 
down. Kwame Brown is playing out 
of his mind and having Chris Mihm 
return (as the back-up center) will 
allow Los Angeles to control the 
paint. While Steve Nash is an amaz-
ing point guard for the Suns, Bryant 
has the drive to play even better in 
the playoffs than he did in the regu-
lar season. As long as Lamar Odom 
continues to bring a triple-dQuble 
threat every night and the Lakers' 
role players hit the open shots, Los 
Angeles will beat Phoenix in six 
games. 

Eastem Cort/erma 
There are still eight possibilities 

for the last four spots in the Eastern 
Conference, but with so much on 
the line, Washington, Indiana and 
Chicago will all win their last games 
and the seedings will stay as they are 
(I hope). Under that assumption, 
here are my predictions: 

Bucks VI. Pilton.

At only 5 feet, 8 inches, David 
Gomez is the shortest player on the 
UCSD baseball team. But his powerful 
bat and big heart carried the Tritons 
to an 8-2 victory OYer Point Lorna 
Nazarene University, as Gomez's 3-
for-3 day, including a home run, gave 
freshman southpaw starting pitcher 
Jon DurItet all he needed to feel com-
fortable on the mound in the first 
collegiate start of his career. 

DurItet, who bas been iJnpressM 
in his relief a~ces as a first-year 
player, looked dazzling on the mound 
in the first inning. setting down the 
side on I groundout. I ftyout and a 
strilccout 

According to Durktt, nervous-
ness was a factor in his start, but not 
for long. 

"I was nervous up until I threw 
the first pitch," he said -After that, I 
got into I zone." 

His promising start continued 
throughout his entire stint on the 
mound, as Durlcet pitched five shut-
out innings. allowing four hits and 
strikins out Iix Sea Lions. 

While Durket coUected his 
thoughts in the dugout after the top 
of the first inning. he saw his offense 
take a 3-0 lead off Sea Lion start-
ing pitcher Shane Kochon. Senior 
centerfielder Damian Fante led off 
the game with a walk and crossed 
the plate on fresIunan first baseman 
Matt CanteJe's RBI double into the 
left -center field gap. Junior IeftfieIder 
David Morehead followed CanteIe 
with a near home runeoff the ript-
field waIl thIt ended II an RBI double 
with CanteJe's run puttina the Tritona 
ahead, 2-0. The no-out rally sud-
denly took • tum for the worse, as 
Scott Clement struck out swinging 
and Morehead got caught stealing. 
but freshman second baseman Garret 
Imeson's double, UCSD's third of the 
innin& put the Tritons in position for 
• two-out rally. 

This set up Gomez to lice the 6 
foot, 1 inch Kochon in an RBI situ-
ation in his first at -bat since comioB 
back from a hip fIemr Itrain. Little 
David beat hia Goliath wiIh • liner to 
left center thIt put the Tritona up 3-0 
goins into the second inniD8-

"1 WII just itchins to set back in 
that lineup.- Gomez said. "1 think that 
helped out • lot because the second 1 
got in the box I was just ready to go.-

In the Point Lorna Nazarene sec-
ond inninIo Durket worked' himself 
out of. one-out, first -and-third situa-
tion, getting the much-needed strike-
out on a swinging strike by Rich 
Killen before working a groundout 
from Joey Boyle. 

UCSD would add another run 
in the second, but the crowd was 
not satisfied until Gomeis second 
at -bat, this time against 6 foot, 4 
inch reIicf pitcher Quia Honer. Once 
again unfued by the towering pitcher 
staring him down from the mound, 
Gomez lined an inside pitch over the 
right-field fence for a homer. The ball 
lifted the aowd to its feet, II the luer 
shot left the park in a burry before 
Gomez could even .. into his trot. 

When asked about any extra phys-
ical preparation that could have led to 
his powa', Gomez 1nIteId offered a 
IDOft intellectual approach.
