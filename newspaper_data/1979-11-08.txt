Third Wins Support 
For Minority Recruiting, 
McElroy Absent 

By Jenifer Warren 
A confrontation between Chancellor 

McEJroy and the Third College Council 
didn't materialize, but the college and its 
provost nevertheless won the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee's 
endorsement yesterday for their proposed 
minority enrollment goC\ls. 

McElroy was invited to attend the 
SAAC meeting and debate the guidelines, 
which he opposes, but his lecretary lays 
no one actually called his office and asked 
him to attend. 

from each of OCSO'. minority student 
unions, found Provost Watson's reasons 
for the admittance of at least 100 blacks, 
100 Chicanos, 85 Asians and 15 Native 
Americans convincirur. "We're not settina 
quotas that might reflect reverse 
discrimination, " Watson streseed. "We 
merely want to stablilize the minority 
enrollment at Third College by setting 
numbers." 

Tickets for the Ted Kennedy UCSD appearance will be available Nov. 
26 at 11 am. 

They' are free, and available at the Box Office, but are limited to two 
per person. 

Not only did SAAC back the college's 
numerical recruiting goals, but SAAC 
member Robert Tambuzi stated, "We will 
also attempt ~o come up with numberical 
goals for minority enrollment that are 
university.wide, as our council is concerned 
with the total campus environment." 

The only real dispute at the meeting 
concerned the possible upward adjustment 
of the set numbers, especially of the 
comparatively low number of Native 
Americans. 

Watson replied that "to achieve 
enrollment of 15 Native Americans would 
be a substantial increase over the few we 
have here this year," but concluded by 
saying the numbers were certainly 
neMotiable. SAAC, composed of representatives

AS Advertises in Guardian-For Now

The AS council voted last 

night to fund advertisements in 
the Daily Guardian after a 
week of debate and amending. 

media advertisements or AS 
Bulletin Board flyers. 

The new bill presented by 
the committee proposed that 
the AS set up the full account, 
but that it would be contingent 
on a "stringent regulatory 
policy." 

AS mem bers ga ve no 
reason for the policy, but last 
week several people, including 
Breslauer, admitted that they 
wanted to cut off ads partly 
because of the Guardian's 
editorial policy and news 

coverage of the AS. 
Breslauer, Rules Co~mit· 

tee chair, commented on last 
~ht's action, "I'm pleased. 
The process of allowing the 
original bill to be amended 
worked, and we also showed 
people there are alternatives." 

The final bill also said that 
the AS Council would set up a 

'plan, by winter quarter, "to 
create more effective and less 
costly" methods . of adverti· 
sing. Most AS members 

wanted to "at least look into 
the possibility of ads in 
alternative media," said one 
council member. 

T opkis, who said last week 
that "subsidizing the Guardian 
for $10,000 sickens me," llaid 
that he wanted to "phase out 
Guardian advertising slowly, 
rather than cut it off all at 
once." He is planning to ask 
student organizations if they 
reaJly need to advertise in the 
Guardian. 

At last Wednesday'. AS 
meeting , Activity Fee 
Commissioner Bill T opkis, 
Appointments and Evalu· 
ations Commissioner Brad 
Barham, and Warren College 
Representative Jan Breslauer 
introduced a bill that would cut 
off AS and student 
organizations' advertising 
money for the fall quarter. 

At the same time, AS 
Preaident Carlos Montalvo 
proposed that the AS u~

Chinese Exchange Profs Get 
Surprising Welcome to UCSD 

By Ka~)' Huff .. 
AIIOCi.te News Editor 

No one was quite prepared for their 
arrival, but yesterday's appearance of five 
Chinese professors here put UCSD's red 
carpel treatment to a test. 

Dining on Revelle's casserole meal last 
night and dropping in San Diego's first 
winter rainstorm, the Chinese arrivals got 
their first taste of American university life. 

From Wuhan, the four men and one 
woman represent the first results of 
Chancellor William McElroy's 
negotiations with two Chinese universities 
for an exchange program, a j)lan 
developed Iaat September when Mc Elro, 
and a OCSD delegation visited the People s 
Republic. 

1M Chinese academics were not 
e1qJeCted here for at least another day, 
A •• istant Chancellor Pat Ledden 
expIIined, .. he and several IP'OUP 
1I1a'nber. l ucIAed the rainy path to 

Revelle's dining hall. 
But yesterday's arrival "isn't really a 

foul·up, it's just a lack of communicationa," 
he said. The Chinese had been expected to 
arrive in San Francisco yesterday, but were 
not anticipated here for one or two more 
days, when the housing at the Mesa 
apartments would be available, he said. 

McElroy was unable to greet the new 
arrivals because of a Board of Overseers 
meeting, and emergency accommodations 
were set up last night for the group at the 
International Center and several nearby 
homes. 

The year.long visitors, too, planned to 
spend a couple days in the Bay area, Hai 
Ming Zon, one of the profe.sora laid 
throuah an interpreter. But upon their 
arrival in San FranciKo, the just.formed 
Chinese consulate there, which was "very 
bu'f" and .till lodged in a nearby hotel, 
apologetically suaested that the group

Alexis Hernandez, co· 
authors, withdrew it. 

The "bill cited T opkis' 
"blatant ignorance" of AS 
structure and asked him to 
"curtail hi. disrespect of the 
counca's intelligence." Topkis 
admitted that he had "made a 
mi.take" in referring bills 
about Angela Davis and 
funding for Cinco de Mayo to 
Finance, but said that he was 
aware of the proper channels 
to go through. He also noted 
that he tried, and had half the 
counca agreeing with him, to 
take the Cinco de Mayo bill 

out of Finance and vote on it 
immediately last week. 

Woodard called the biD a 
"po~tical ploy," commenting 
that "It's done all the time in 
legislature. They wanted to 
make a point and tell Bill, so 
they introduced this bill and 
then withdrew it." . 

A similar biD introduced by 
Linda Sabo was also 
withdrawn.

How Do We Sort Out The Good ,In People? 
BJ Katherine Hafner year. ago and I finally plucked up my 

I've been thinking a lot these day. courall,e Ia.t Friday to call Mr. Cook. He 
about being a grown·up; about having a wa. ' deliJlhted" to hear from me. OF 
functiOn and making a ~ving; about COURSE he remembered me, he said. 
maintaini!'C my aanity. ' In fact, he remembered thing. about me 

I eat there and lli.tened to him tell me 
that "progressivist" parents disapproved 
of his 'discipliniarian tendenciea. He told 
me that when he took a trip back East 
recently to vi.it hili daughter they were 
.hown government-subsidized housing 
in New York City. "Do you know that 
thOle tenants actually tear out the 
plumbing and seU it? Do you know that 
thOle playgrounds, the sort that we in 
Del Mar can't afford are covered with 
graffiti? AU paid for with our tax 
dollars." 

A friend criticized me recently for my 
inabi~ty to separate people's pootical 
beliefs from their overall perlOna~ty and 
their worth all human beings. I am, my 
friend . aid , altogether too hasty in 
making judgementa. And he's right, of 
course . People in real estate can be very 
nice. Those who favor the Briggs 
initiative are not fundamentally evil. 

Thi. might havelomething to do with that I didn't recall. For instance the 
the rec:ent flashback. I've been havin, "debate" I had one day with Larry 
from Mr. Cook', fifth grade cla.s. Staver, who had brought a Plallboy to 

clan, over what conatituted good Katherine Hainer is a Daily Guardian 
ataff writer. literature. . 

remember I uaed to get angry with my 
beet friend Jocelyn for flaying horse 
dwing rec:e.. instead 0 four-aquare, 
which resulted in the horse faction and 
the four.square faction at the Del Mar 
Elementary School, and an irrevocable 
.pit between Jocelyn and myself. I 
remember wearing a headgear on my 
braces - named Hymie - and being 
...... about it. 

I a.ked Mr. Cook if I might pay him a 
vilit. He said, why of course, since he 
had re.tired four years earlier and didn't 
do too much except "lead the good life." 

Mr. Cook lives in a large house in old 
Del Mar with hi. wife and a mobile 
home, which they keep in the back yard. 

I drank: a gla .. of white wine with ice; 
he drank a bourbon and seven. 

This wa. running through my mind a s 
I sat in that warm living room, my 
stomach tenle, the television beckoning 
from the den. Nearly two hours had 
palled. I told Mr. Cook I had better be 
going. He insisted on giving me a tour of 
the mobile home on the way out. I 
expressed my amazement at how many 
of the necessary comforts of home can 
be fit into such a amall area. They take 
the camper on long filhing trip. in the 
High Sierra. ("my wife likes to crochet") 
and they camp at RV lites. 

Moat of alii remember Mr. Cook who 
teemed ready to retire, or die, anyciay. 1 
remember his endleu stories about the 
preIIlft cooker that ~&oded, hi. 
pen apple belly ache, and his incensed 
lectures on the wrong. of. welfare and 
taxes ("I foutht my own way out 01 the 
ahetto, and tl.at has convinced me that 
an~ can do the same thing"). 

We were aU awestruck by Mr. Coole, 
and au. maaic way 01 inboducing new 
lhintl to UI 10 that they Iluck forever. 

Except for the addition of a. hearing 
aid, Mr. Cook him,aelf has hardly 
changed. He seem. jUit as old to me now 
as he did then, He pressed my face 
between hi. hands and said, "There she 
is. There's my girl." 

Alter I had seated myself in their 
living room Mr. Cook, naturally, wanted 
to know all about me and what I had 
made of myself. I declined to tell him that 
I was neither an aspiring doctor nor 
lawyer; nor did Ilell him that the thought 
of becoming a "girl executive" I fOWKl 
loathsome. lnatead, I asked him to teU 
me about himself and, in the manner I 
remember 10 well, he .began to talk , and 
talk and talk. 

I sat there and I ~.tened to him eay 
these thing. and I felt .Iightly sick. Mr. 
Cook was a teacher whom I had not only 
adored more than anyone else when I 
was ten, but whose teaching and way of 
teeing the world had remained with me 
for aU these yean. 

How had I, I a.ked myself, ever 
managed to avoid adopting such 
narrow-minded, reactionary views? 
Surely they mu.t be lurking somewhere 
inaide .... 

I said very ~tt1e. Occasionally I 
nodded and smiled. When I did .peak, it 
wa. necessary to repeat myself because 
Mr. Cook's hearing aid periodicaUy 
Ioaea contact. I wa • .hattered. 

As he accompanied me down hi. Ion¥. 
driveway, he remarked that he didn t 
remember my being 10 shy. "But ~t's 
charming," he said. "You should hold 
onto that quality." 

Just before we parted he said, "If 
you're ever feeling low, and you need 
lOftleone to tum to, jUit write me a letter. 
I alway. write back." And I know he 
does. I relwned to Southern California four

Censored Words Should Stay, or Stay Out 
Editor: 

Dear reader: If the editor is 10 kind not to censor thi. letter, 
please indulge me in a little argument. 

It seems that Eric Jaye, the editor of The Dailll Guardian, 
took the liberty to refuse publication the phrue "careless .tuta" 
in an article dealing with an iuue which need not concern UI 
further. 

I can think of three re81OD1 that might cause the editor to take 
this action: he felt the phrase was by nature offensive and 
unworthy of ~tion; he thoutrht the phrue gratuitous; he 
oppoeed the t that the phrue intended to convey. 
-But thia cannot the first cue, as he has pennitted tIU very 

phrue to be uaed by opinion editor John Taylor in the Nov. 2 
edition 01 1M Dailll Gacardian and (by Mr. Iaye'sgood I"ace) 
me. 

Nor can it be the aecond case. IncHed, Mr. Taylor eloquently 
ahowa in his article that the phrase "canIeu sluts" beIiea in the 
cenaored author a Itrong moral foundation, a not unworthy feat! 

U we then conclude that the editor invoked the action of 
c= because he was penonaIIy oppoaed to the thought 
e , we have ~ very aeriou.. 

Of cOtne this action apeaks ill 01 the aUepd free exprealion of 
the .audenta 01 thi. ~ 1hr0Ulh their appointed mouthpiece, 
but thia i. nodmt. It is ~y the prerOlJalive 01 the chief 
editor to cenaor ideas that he linda offenaive. 

But is it aIao the prer •• live 01 the editor to have his junior 
editor rebut an article that was refuaed publication in ita entirety? 
To have his jwUor editor lift thi. cenaored phrase out of context 
and foUt on the ruder., you and me, a peraonaI interpretation of 
the cenIOred author'. thOUllhIl? 

Now thia phnue .. ca ...... aluta" won't incite anyone to 
c:ommit acta ...... the ltate, and it ain't libelous. If it was, I 
ahouId be in Ietal jeopardy to write "the men 01 our society are 

10athaome beasts,' " and we all know that varianta of thi. theme 
have enjoyed free exprellion in sundry literature. 

So we are left to ponder why the thought behind these two little 
worda "careleu" and .... uta" hal caused our esteemed editor to 
execute this serious act of censorllhip, and hi. second John 
Taylor to rebut idea. too sensitive for publication. 

Let us follow the argument a step further. Of what nature is the 
phrase "careles. slut?" I think that all readers will agree that if 
anything, in the writer'. mind the phrase connotes a moral 
quality of the penon. predicated (this is the contention of Mr. 
Taylor). 

77aen what can it mean when .tatement. purporti", moral 
loundation are cenaorH, lIet tltelr oppoait .. are published? 

It is tempting to anawer aomethng lilce "joumaIill1l at UCSD 
is a mockery of the lint amendment ideal, at least under the 
present editonhip," but that .it too aimpJe an e""na~. ~e 
i. aometbn, deeper here. It .1 the nature of an idea which dnvea 
peraona to distortion and censorahip that merita our especial 
attention. 

But of the subject itself I have promiaed to say nothini. I 
request thouP that you, the reader, correct me if I am MODI in 
thinking that Mr. Jaye hal at least demonstrated partiality and 
poor judgement in the conduct of his duliea. At worst he hal 
breachecfjoumalistic ethics by pennitti"l Mr. Taylor'. article to 
be bliahed. n:: implicationl 01 this action are not only that contribution. 
to The Daily Guardian are unsafe from cenaonhip, but that the 
editora may attack the uncenaored version of an article that is 
withheld from public scrutiny. 

This policy i. W1"OIl8. I request apoloty 'Or diamiual of Mr. 
Jaye and Mr. Taylor for thil unfortunate precedent, and hope 
that you, the reader, concur with my arptMl!lta.

occurring there." 

Mrs. Carter and a delegation of aide., including 
the U.S. surgeon general, left Andrew. Air Force 
Base, Md., with a request from the president to 
asseas the obstacles to delivery of food and medical 
supplies to Cambodia and its countrymen who have

'The president .aid the warring faction. in

yellterday he will leek the presidency in 1980 
becauae Pre.ident Carter has failed to provide 
Ieaderahip to a country that i. "willing, even anxious, 
to be on the march again." 

'The last of the Kennedy brother. and heir to a 
modern political dynasty made his announcement in 
Boston's historic Faneuil Hall, listing what he called 
IItark failures of Carter administration domestic 
policies. 

Then the Maasachuletts Democrat left on a 
sweeping campaign trip taking him from Maine to 
Oklahoma, with stops in New Hamp,hire, Illinois, 
Tennessee, Florida , South Carolina and 
COIUlecticut. 

Kennedy laid that before the last presidential 
election, "we were told that American. were honelt, 

lovi~, good, decent and compaslionate. Now, the 
people are blamed for every national ~I and scolded 
as greedy, wasteful and mired in malaise." 

'Which ia it?" he a.ked. "Did we change 10 much 
in these three years? Or is it because our pre.ent 
leadership does not under.tand that we are willing, 
even anxious, to be on the march again?" 

Iran Oil Flowing 
NEW YORK - The State Department and 

major oa companies said Wedneaday that tankers 
were loading in Iran, but wholesale horne heating oil 
prices rose sharply after reports that oa had been cut • 
off. 

The reports of a ahutdown at Iran'. main Perlian 
G~ terminal, Kharg laIand, ponibly due to local 
labor troubles, were denied by Iran's oil mini.ter and 
national oil company. 

But wholesale spot market prices for home heating 
oa continued to rise aharply because of worries over 
the Iranian .itutation - although US .upplies were 
said to be plentiful. 

"It i. m)' understanding that at thi. point there is no

"You keep faith with me the next four weeks and

Yau brouaht up the point 
that pro-choice aupporlen, 
along with the Supreme Court, 
Icramble to anlwer the 
question of when life begin •. 
A.. this relates to other iuues 
besides abortion, the Supreme 

Court addressed thilqueation 
in 1973 and ruled: "We need 
not relolve the difficult 
q~1ion of when life begins. 
When those trained in the 
relpective dilciplines of 
medicine, philosophy and 
theoIOIY are unable to arrive 
at a conaenaua, the judiciary at 
this point in the development 
of man's knowledge is not in a 
position to lpeculate as to the 
answer." 

I don't think the question of 
when life begins il the thrust of 
the pro-choice pollition. It is a 

question that w'e are 
continually confronted with by 
pro·life lupporters who, in my 
opinion and al you pointed 
out, are attempting to cloud 
the real illue. 

Supporters for pro-choice 
will continue to try to prevent 
people from legislating their 
own morality and make the 
right to choose to have an 
abortion available to every 
woman in ev~ry situation.

"My principal role i. 
working with my colleagues 
here and elsewhere, trying to 
decide what the problems in 
the next five years are going to 
be and then trying to help the 
scientists and the students of 
the institution be prepared for 
those problems," Nierenberg 
explains. 

Nierenberg foresees the 
major thrust of scientific 
research for the institute in the 
next years as being concerned 
with the ecology of the 
Antarctic region. 

According to Nierenberg, 
Antarctica has become an 
abundant source of a shrimp· 
like animal called "krill. " 
Nations of the world are 
starting to fish this animal for 

protein, and Scrippl Institute is 
deeply concerned about the 
effect of mass removal of these 
animals on the ecology of the 
area. 

"I expect that this i. going to 
be a very important scientific 
problem and alao an important 
social problem," Nierenberg 
saYI. 

In preparing Scripps 
Institute for such upcoming 
illues in the science world, 
Nierenberg exaplins, "What 
you as.ume is that your 
iilstitute is very well founded in 
the basic sciences. You then 
try to .trengthen these basic 
science. so that they can deal 
with these problems." 

Nierenberg adds, "We are 
now in the phase of really 
strengthening the variety of 
these interdisciplinary 
activities. "

It's Not Rock and Roll 

Fencers OvercoDle ·Snafu, Not Inexperience 
By Grell J..auahlin 

Staff Writer 
Despite a number of 

frustrating organizational 
setbacks, the fencing team 
finally took to the road 
Saturday to compete q:ainst 
CSULA and Cal State 
Northridge in Los Angeles. 

The inexperienced Triton 
fencers placed third in the 
competition. a . fair distance 
behind second·place CSULA 
and the top·finishing 
Northridge team. 

Allistant Coach Katherine 
Kassebatpn, also a fencer with 
the Tritons, said ' that it was 
hard for the team to be 
"emotionally prepared" for the 
meet. 

The team had encountered 
problems earlier Saturday 
when they tried to pick up the 
school vans to g.o to the meet. 

Evidently, the manager 
failed to understand that the 
vans had to be picked up on 
Friday afternoon for weekend 
use, 

This created problems 
Saturday morning when the 
team discovered that they 
would have to provide their 
own transportation to the meet 
because all the vans were 
locked up for the weekend. 

Saturday'. meet was the 
6rlt fencing competition ever 
for most of the Triton fencers, 
and this lack of experience 
hurt the leam's effort. 

However, several of the 
novice. did surprisingly well 
for their first meet, particularly 
John Sobieski, who coupled 
hil height advantage with an 
aggressive style to give him a 
victory in the difficult epee 
com.pe~tion. Tall fencers do

particularly well because of

they thrust forward in an

Epee fencing resembles foil 
fencing as rock and roll 
dancing resemble ballet -
there is virtually no structure to 
epee matches. There are no 
right-of·way rules governing 
attacks. 

Steve Pearson tumed in the 
best performance of the 
veteran fencers, winning five 
of six epee bouts . Pearson is a

Chinese Profs Here 
ContinueC# from page 1 
continue to San Diego. Accommodations here would be "very 
friendly," the UCSD visitors were told. 

So when McElroy's 'office received word early yesterday 
afternoon for the Chinese fmballY in Waahington, DC that the 
five profeslOrs would arrive in San Diego in just a few hours, 
the)' had to decide "what to do with them," Herbenar said. 

But deapite their 20·hour long trip and confusing American 
rec~tion, the Chineae were in good .pirita. 

Three of the arrivals who tested UCSD's cafeteria food 
admitted they were "very tired," and were not opposed to 
Ledden's promise, "Tomorrow you can sleep." 

Meanwhile, McElroy's office is scrambling to get 6nens and 
other supplies ready for the group's move today to Mesa, 
Herbaner said. "I'll bring lOme old towels from home to make 
them feel more comfortable," she said.
