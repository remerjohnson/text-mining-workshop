UC Panel Advo(:ates 
Admission Alterations 

By Sonia Minden 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

"Who should be admitted into 
the largest and most prestigious pub-
lic [university] system in the world, 
and how should these decisions be 
made?" 

This was the focal question raised 
and addressed in a recent report 
released by a panel of UC profes-
sors, which proposes a new process 
for UC admissions. The revised sy -
tern would emphasize factors such as 

personal achievement as opposed to 
academic measnres of talent like GPA 
and SAT scores. The system would be 
geared toward admitting a broader 
range of talent more representative 
of California's diverse population, the 
panel said. The implementation would 
mean a shift from the long-standing 
40-year UC eligibility process. 

The new system was first presented 
at a conference that marked the 10th 
anniversary of Proposition 209, which

Judge Upholds Aid Pull for Drug Convictions LAW 
COUNCIL 
REVAMPS 

LSAr 

Court rules federal 
financial aid 
revocation for illegal 
drug possession is 
not unconstitutional. 

By Jadyn Appel 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

Last month, a federal judge dis-
missed a lawsuit challenging the 
constitutionality of a drug provi-
sion that prevents students from 
receiving federal aid if convicted 
of drug offenses while enrolled in 
college. 

In the lawsuit, Students for 
Sensible Drug Policy and the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
claimed that a provision in the 
Higher Education Act violated the 
Fifth Amendment on two charges. 
By singling out individuals con-
victed of drug charges, the gov-
ernment was denying due process, 
they said. . 

In addition, by punishing stu-
dents legally and taking away their 
aid for the same crime, the Higher 
Education Act provision resulted 

, in double jeopardy, the lawsuit 
stated. 

"The mere fact that the classifi-
cation itself results in some inequal-
ity or unfairness ' does not, in and

of itself, offend the Constitution; 
U.S. District Court Judge Charles 
B. Kornmann stated in his ruling. 
"The'Constitution affords no right 
to a higher education .... Likewise, 
there is no fundamental right to the 
receipt of federal student financial 
aid." 

According to Kornmann, 
Congress had a "rational basis" for 
passing the law, despite allegations 
of due process denial. The U.S. 
Department of Education's goal was 
that the law would be responSible 
for decreaSing the amount of drug 
offenses on college campuses and 
preventing citizens from paying 
federal taxes supporting illegal con-
duct. For that reason, Kornmann 
said he was convinced that the law 
was worthy of being legitimately 
pursued by the government. 

Kornmann also dismissed the 
accusation of double jeopardy; the 
law, he said, was not intended to 
punish students on a legal basis for 
drug crimes, but rather to encour-
age them to discontinue drug use 
and undergo rehabilitation. 

Despite the issue of the Higher 
Education Act's constitutionality, 
members of SSDP are dissatisfied 
with the law and would like to 
abolish it. Congress amended the 
Higher Education Act in 1988 to 
deny federal student aid to first -
time drug offenders for one year. 
two years for those convicted a 

second time and permanently for 
those who are convicted a third 
time. Last January, the law was 
changed again so that only students 
who are convicted of drug offenses 
while enrolled in a university and 
receiving financial aid could be 
subject to its consequences. 

"We are outraged with the judge's 
ruling [and] disagree with his rea-
soning." SSDP Campaign Director 
Tom Angell said. "It is complete-
ly irrational to attempt to reduce 
drug abuse by kicking students out 
of school. This law should [be] 
erased from the books aitogether. 
Otherwise eligible students should 
not have their fmancial aid stripped 
from them because of minor drug 
convictions." 

Another problem with the pro-
vision, according to the plaintiffs. 
is that it targets only one aspect of 
crime. 

"It is true as pointed out by the 
plaintiffs," Kornmann said, "that 
students convicted of possessing 
small amounts of marijuana may 
be prevented from receiving federal 
student financial aid while those 
students convicted of serious sexual 
or violent crimes would not suffer a 
similar fate." 

Nonetheless, the U.S . 
Department of Education stands by 
Kornmann's ruling. 

"Department officials are grati-
fied by the court's decision and 

SPORTS

will continue to carry out the 
law," department spokeswoman 
Stephanie Baybak said. 

UCSD Director of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs 
Anthony Valladolid was unable to 
disclose whether any UCSD stu-
dents were directly impacted by the 
Higher Education Act. 

"Given that drug convictions are 
required to be disclosed on [Free 
Application for Student Aid] appli-
cations, 1 can assume some of our 
students are affected," he said. "I do 
not have specific information as it 
is protected by [Family Education 
Rights and Privacy Act] and not 
publicly disclosed."

The biggest change to the Law 
School Admission Test in IS years 
will, in reality, be a small change. 
There will be a slight alteralion to 
the reading comprehension and 
writing sample sections, according 
to Steven Marietti, the director of 
pre-law programs at Kaplan Test 
Prep and Admissions. 

The style of questions on the 
LSAT has remained consistent for 
the last I S years. 

The writing sample section cur-
rently can include an argument or 
decision prompt, but once the new 
changes take effect, only decision 
prompts will be included. 

The comprehension section, 
which now consists of four passages 
with approximately seven multiple 
choice questions each, will consist 
of five passages with seven or so 
questions spLit among two smaller 
passages.

Propels Asian 

Figures 
• RACES, from page 2 
California Postsecondary Education 
Commission found that the rate of 
Asian high school students eligible 
for admission to the UC system 
is about two and a half times the 
overall rate. Given their high eligi-
bility rates, the typical Asian student 
usually looks to the most affordable 
college education, Wilbur said. 

"The cost of a U C education is 
undoubtedly an additional factor· 
that contributes to student enroU-
ment decisions; she said. "Many 
Asian students have a low family 
income and qualify for [the univer-
sity's] financial aid programs." 

But the biggest force behind 
the inflating en rollment numbers 
may be Proposition 209, accord-
ing to Steve Goodman, an educa-
tional consultant for Top Colleges. a 
Washington, D.C. firm that counsels 
students on admission processes. 

The 1996 legislation abolished all 
considerations of race in public-col-
lege admissions, effectively killing 
affirmative action in the state. The 
law emphasizes concrete achieve-
ments - a trait especially strong 
among Asians, giving them an 
advantage over other racial groups, 
Goodman said. 

"Asians are the single largest 
beneficiary race of [Proposition 
209] ; he said. 

With PropoSition 209 in place, 
Goodman said he sees no end to the 
rising trend. 

"If colleges are going to keep 
looking just at the hard numbers, 
then the Asian population will be the 
largest in higher education:' he said.

OUR HATE OF 
CHEMISTRY 
FOR GOOD 

I hate chem istry." If I had a dollar for every time I heard those words - or said them 
myself - my worries about tuition 
payments would be a tiny speck on the 
horizon behind me. Heck, instead of 
taking the bus to school, Iii pull up to 
the Scripps pier in my 200-foot yacht-
house - and if an oceanographer 
complained about it, I(I tell him to kiss 
Illy diamond -encrusted foot. 

~Chicken ~~ Scratch -~ Nathan Miklos 
- 11miklo s<a ucsd.ed u 

But even though I could make a 
pretty penny by admitting it, I don't 
really hate chemistry. I dislike chemis-
try. More specifically, I dislike the gulf 
between the work I do and its benefit 
to the world. A ditch-digger must get 
a certain satisfaction at the end of the 
day, becau e he's dug a d itch. It 's right 
there. But as a lab monkey, all I get is 
the vague belief that my little test-tube 
antics may do someth ing, somewhere, 
eventually, as a tiny cog in some mas-
sive mach ine. My dislike fo r chemistry 
is very specific. 

That's why it bothers me when I 
hear the occasional younger student 
say that they hate chemistry, railing 
against UCSD's general education 
requ irements. They complain that, as 
literature or economics majors, the 
likelihood that they will need to use 
chemistry in the real world is next to 
nil. Why, thl!Y lament, should they be 
forced to learn the Gibbs free energy 
equation, or integrate rate laws or cal-
culate charge density on a conjugated 
system? 

I've never really understood this 
argument. For one, the GE require-
ments work both ways. I doubt "The 
Can terbury Tales" will ever come up . 
in a conversation, but I've read them 
all the same - in Middle English, 
to boot. I'm sure the Harrod-Domar 
model of economic growth will come 
in handy one day - but I've yet to see 
that day. 

Furthermore, humanities and 
social science majors have the option 
of fulfilling their GE requirements 
with watered -down math and science 
sequences for "nonscience" majors. 
Science types, on the other hand, 
end up in the same lower-division 
sequences as the real -deal political 
scientists and Baudelaire-spouting 
literature' majors. Oh , the horrid 
injusticel 

But I don't mean to complain. 
I d idn't mind British Literature. I 
enjoyed the foreign language dasses 
I took. I even felt a little bad for 
my human ities-oriented friends: 
My introductory sequences were 
designed to challenge m e, while their 
lower division classes were meant for 
everyONe. 

While my friends were whining 
about the injustice of their required 
calculus courses, they should have 
been up in arms about how the 
humanities departments can't afford 
to have separate classes for majors. 
They should be enraged that their 
departments expect no more out of 
them than they do a casual student. 

In "the real world; you'll come 
across things you don't really want to 
do - but you'll have to do them any-
way. Mayas well rese.rve your hate for 
things you can change.

Public Single-Sex Schools 
a Much-Needed Change 

By Lindsay Brothers 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

America's public schools are 
failing. Plagued by insufficient 
funds, underpaid teachers. and 
a useless standardized testing 
system , our public schools need. 
change and innovation. Thanks to 
a recent relaxing of Department 

there is an equivalent co-ed or 
opposite-sex school or class. Many 
states have opened new schools in 
anticipation of the rule change. 

Single-sex education is already 
popular in the private sphere. But 
the ability to pay for such an option 
should not limit a child's educa-
tional opportunities. Learning is 
not one size fits all; some may 

thrive in a same-sex of Education rules, we 
may see just that, in the 
form of single-sex edu-
cation.

Beginning Nov. 24. public 

schools are allowed to be divided 
by sex, and new Single-sex schools 
can be opened more easily. The 
new regulations received support

Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and 
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-
N.Y.) spearheading for the inclu-
sion of single-sex options within 
the "No Child Left Behind" frame-

The new regulations are revi-
sions of Tide IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972, which pre-
vents any form of discrimination 
between sexes in federally funded 
schools. And unlike the largely 
unpopular No Child Left Behind 
program, the government appears 
to have gotten it right this time 
- by loosening the rules for once 
- with the goal of ellpanding 
educational options for parents.

Other studies have looked at the

Single-sex schooling is a great 
option for many parents and stu-

with proper planning. Simply

Segregated Education a 
Step Back for Equality 

By Hadlty Mmdoza 
SENIOR STAfF WRITER 

Recent legislation allowing for 
public single-sex schools is just 
another example of skewed political 
priorities. The new rules. announced 
by U.S. Education Secretary Margaret 
Spellings, condone public single-sex 
schools, abandoning the current pro-

suddenly gender stigmas are being 
legitimized in public schools. If an 
elementary school is separated by 
gender, institutions devoted to edu-
cation will only encourage cbild-
hood taboos about "cooties" and the 
opposite sex. 

Supporters of the shift say that 
the schools will open doors for stu-
dents who are nervous to volunteer h ibition that has been in ______ _ in class in front of the 

opposite sex. But the real 
world is not divided by 

place for over 30 years. 
As part of the "No Child 
Left Behind" campaign. 

CON 
which is widely and appropriately 
recognized as a failure. the new rules 
fit right in. 

The new regulations are such 
that one sex can have its own school, 
as long as there is a "substantially 
equal" co-cd equivalent. This means 
it is acceptable for an aII-boy school 
to be started - without an all-girl 
school - 50 long as there is a co-cd 
school in the area. This raises many 
questions about equality of oppor-
tunities for the genders, In theory 
the rules are designed to adhere to 
Title IX. but in practice this design 
seems a little too similar to "separate 
but equal." History clearly shows 
that separate almost never guaran-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-
Busby Is San Diego's 
Best Choice for Rep. 

Dear Editor, 
UCSD students, staff and faculty 

are greatly impacted by who represents 
us in the House of Representatives 
for this area. Republican Brian Bilbray 
edged out Democrat Francine Busby 
in a special election last year to fill the 
vacancy of Republican Randy "Duke" 
Cunningham who is now serving over 
eight years in prison. 

A few noteworthy issues affecting 
you include the ability of this congress-
person to vote on issues such as wheth-
er students who were convicted on 
misdemeanor drug possession infrac-
tions remain ineligible for receiving any 
fmancial aid during thei r entire college 
careers. This person votes on whether 
we allow offshore oil drilling along our 
coast. This person votes on whether we 
"stay the course" in spending billions 
of dollars a month and American and 
Iraqi lives fighting in Iraq. T hi person 
votes on whether textbook companies 
can continue to reap highly inflated 
profits for overpriced new editions of 
existing textbooks. 

Bilbray refused to list his main job 
on the ballot in the last special election. 
At the time, though, he was a lobbyist 
for anti-immigration groups as well as 
San Diego Gas & Electric Company. 
Instead he chose deception over 
transparency and listed "Immigration 
Reform Consultant" as his tide. Bilbray 
received $7,000 in donations from 
the defense contractor lobbyist who 
funded Cunningham. Bilbray is now 
under investigation by a . grand jury 
for possible perjury and fraud related 
to where he was actually living versus 

where he listed his primary residence, 
50 that he would be able to run for this 
office. 

Bilbray says our invasion of Iraq 
"may take decades." Bilbray has accept-
ed more than $ 140,000 in donations 
from oil and gas companies and has 
voted to lift the ban on offshore oil 
drilling along our coast. He voted to 
give himself a pay raise his very fi rst 
day in office. 

Busby supports a responsible exit 
plan from Iraq, opposes oil drilling 
off the California coast, refuses to 
accept any pay raises until Congress 
stops deficit spending, supports stern 
cell research, has been endor I'd by 
the Sierra Club and the League of 
Conservation Voters and served as 
an adjunct professor at Cal State San 
Marcos. Please be aware as members of 
this institution of higher learning that 
we need to make an informed choice 
this Nov. 7.

THE UCSD GUARD tAN OPtNIONS 

Same-Sex Union Supporters Must 
Take the Slower, Steadier Route 

By Marina Triner 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

O ne hundred years from now, 
legalizing gay marriage might seem 
like an ancient idea that was part of 
the evolution of civil rights - paral-
lel to the way we view the fight for 
women's suffrage today. While we're 
not there yet, the road to making gay 
marriage legal is slowly being paved 
by decisions like the o ne made last 
month by the New Jersey Supreme 
Court. 

The court ruled that while the 
state's constitut ion can give all the 
rights of marriage to gay couples, it 
cannot confer the title of "marriage" 
- and that the decision to assign 
this tide must transfer to the state 
Legislature. The process of legal-
izing the use of the term "marriage" 
for gay u nions should be in the 
legislatu re's hands, as the Supreme 
Court determined, because it is the 
only way by which the decision can 
acquire not only lega lization, but 
also social acceptance. 

The court gave the Legislature 
s ix months to come up with stat-
utes for gay partnerships that would 
be equal to that of marriage. The 
Legislature's toughest struggle, 
however. is in determining whether 
the partnerships should be called 
"marriages" or "civil unions:' While 
a civil union- provides almost the 
same rights as marriage, it is a term 
used to avoid the religious implica-
tions that many see in the word 
"marriage:' . 

But semantics aside, the idea of 
putting this decision in the hands 
of legislatures is very significant. 
Transferring the power to make this 
major decision to legislatures will 
ensure that it is in the hands of the 

• 

people, and as a result, any vote in 
favor of civil un ions becomes much 
more legitimate. And for the issue 
of same-sex marriages in particular, 
any attempt to pass measures with-
out the consent of at least a majority 
of the population will fall nat. 

Consider the alternative: In 2004, 
San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom 
handed out marr iago! lie nses for 
same-sex marriages in defiance of 
California law, which permits only 
civil unio ns. The Ca li forn ia Supreme 

The process of 
legalizing the use of 
the tenn 'marriage' 

for gay unions should 
be at the hands of 
the legislature, as 

the Supreme Court 
detennined .. ?' 

Court late r overturned the nearly 
4,000 marriages performed at the 
San Francisco City Hall, deciding 
that the mayor exceeded his author-
ity. Though Newsom's grand gesture 
captured the spirit of much of the 
city of San Francisco - and per-
haps the near future of California 
- his one -man crusade was eventu-
ally reversed, and created a serious 
conservative backlash. 

Shortly after Newsom's proc-
lamation , President George W 
Bush called fo r the creation of a 
Constitutional amendment that 

would limit marriage to a un ion 
between a man and a woman, and 
major parts of the conservative base 
mobilized in response. 

"The more they shoot their 
mouths off, doing th ings that offe nd 
ordinary people, the better for 
Bush," Bay Area GOP activist Loren 
T hornton told the San Francisco 
Chronicle. He a rgued that Newsom's 
decision would "force polit icians to 
take a tand, and if Ihey tand with 
gay marr iage. they're dead." 

O n the o ther ha nd, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger vetoed a 2005 bill 
that would have legalized gay mar-
riage, stating th.it a public mandate 
was needed. He reasoned that let-
ting voters decide on the law would 
be the most productive, rega rdless 
of his own personal beliefs. 

Legalizing the rights of gay cou-
ples may seem simple, but full social 
acceptance of these rights cannot be 
legislated. 

O n Nov. 7, eight more states will 
vote on constitut ional bans of same-
sex marriages, and seven other states 
are considering similar measures. 

Only the vote of the people can 
completely validate a law concern -
ing gay marriage, because it's the 
people who would be responsible 
fo r accepting the idea. Tho ugh gay 
marriage may be gaining acceptance 
in some regions, it still faces a hard 
road to acceptance in nuny others. 
The best way to earn this acceptance 
is to let the people make a decision 
for themselves, rather than have it 
thrust upon an unwilling popula-
tion. Moreover, the fact that the leg-
islative process is an extremely slow 
one gi.ves the people time to adjust. 

If created by the people, a law has 
a much greater chance to win toler-
ance rather than just be obeyed.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONO ,NOVEMBER 6, 2006 

Girls May Do Better in a Same-Sex Environment 
~ PRO, from page 4 
one·driven leenage males into one 
room will likely prove unproductive. 
The point of same-sex schooling is 
to draw from each gender's strengths, 
and curriculum musl be adjusted to 
suit the specific needs of each gender, 
with lessons based upon their learn-
ing styles. Curricula should empha-
size the idea of gender equality and 
not to reinforce gender stereotypes. 
This will only work with sufficient 
support from parents, teachers and 
the school administrators who deter-
mine curricula. 

The new ·regulations do not 
amount to segregation, as enroll -
ment is completely voluntary. As 
opposed to racial segregation of the 
past, schools must be ·comparable" 
in that the same amount of money 
is spent on each and facilities and 
facuJty are of the same quality. Also. 
racial differences are not real, while 
gender differences are: studies have 
shows that the brains of men and 
women are physiologically different. 
If a parent believes these differences 
matter enough for their child to go to 
a single-sex school, then the option 

shouJd be available. 
This is not only about whether 

Single-sex or cooed schools are better, 
but about giving parents - and Iheir 
children - the greatest number of 
opportunities possible. And the open· 
ing of pUblic single· sex school gives 
parents more choice in how their kids 
learn. We are a country that places 
a high value on having an educated 
population and we should provide a 
variety of ways to learn . These new 
regulations are an innovative change 
in a schooling system that desperately 
needs it. 

For College Prep, Same-Sex Schools No Better 
~ CON, frolT) page 4 

And regardless of whether it is 
helpful or harmful, why is same-sex 
schooling a priority? It isn't in the best 
interests of the population at large: A 
study by the Department of Education 
showed no difference between same-
sex and cooed schools when it comes 
to college test scores, graduation 
rates and graduate school attendance. 
Preparing students for higher educa· 
tion is a top priority, but there is no 
evidence that same-sex schools do 
this better than cooed schools. If any-
thing, the next generation will move 
dangerously backward, developing the 

idea that gender inequality and sepa-
ration are the norm. 

With so many other areas of educa-
tion scraping for funds, it is pointless 
for such a smaU group to be favored 
- especially when it undermines 30 
years of gender-equality promoting 
policy. Public schools and universi-
ties are experiencing budget cuts and 
struggling for resources, most notably 
in recent years; it's irresponsible of the 
federal government to endorse proj-
ects such as this. 

Students at public high schools 
across the nation are barely getting 
by, classrooms are overcrowded. text-

books are outdated and worn and 
teachers are spread too thin, unable 
to help every student. Because of this, 
S percent .of high school students 
nationwide are flunking out, power-
less against such a lack of resourc-
es. Meanwhile, the Department of 
Education is supporting the devel-
opment of same-sex schools, letting 
these other areas of education faU 
by the wayside, despite the lack of 
research favoring this. 

The government needs to realign 
its priorities and consider the bigger 
picture as far as public schools are 
concerned. .

UThe Ground RulM of Science: 
• LSAT, from page 1 

The two smaUer passages now 
also cover a different skill: compara-
tive reading. The other four pas-
sages will remain the same. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior and UCSD Pre-Law Society 
Secretary Lindsay Osborn, who 
recently finished her LSAT test-
ing, said that ~tudents planning to 
take the test should prepare for the 

c~anges. 
- Take a course; Osborn said 

when she heard about the new 
changes. "Kaplan knows what's 
going on; it is better to be safe than 
sorry." 

The LSAT currently consists 
of six 35-minute sections. The six 
components - analytical reason-
ing, two logical reasoning, reading 
comprehension, a writing sample 
and experimental section - com-
bine to averilg~ approximately 100 
questions. 

Neither the experimental and 
writing sample are not scored. 

Though essentiaUy only seven 
questions will be affected, those 
seven questions can accumulate to 
three to six points in an overaU 
score ranging from 120 to 180. 

Considering that 150 is the aver-
age score, those minimal points end 
up holding great value when used 
for law school admissions and com-
pared to feUow competitors, Marietti 
said. Although the structure and 
format of the exam remains the 
same, the change should be noted 
by students planning to take the 
test. 

"Anytime there is change, regard-
less of magnitude, if there is time 
to prepare you can at least avoid 
uncertainty; Marietti said. 

The Law School Admission 
Council, which distributes the LSAT, 
will be releaSing a sample ofthe new 
comparative reading questions in 
February 2007, although it will not 
compare to the approximately 5,000 
past questions students taking the 
LSAT before June 2007 can view, 
according to Marietti. 

The average student spends a 
two to three months preparing for 
the LSAT, so aspiring students plan-
ning to take the new LSAT should 
prepare for the new type of ques-
tions accordingly, Marietti said.

,\Ill! un like individuals affected by 
HI\, and AIDS In America, those In 

lalawl don't have many choices In 
dcaitng with their situation . 

Each shirt In tcrVarsity handed 
lIut was supposed to be accompanied 

by a brochu re that helped explain 
the goal of the program. However, 
not enough brochure. were made 
to meet the overwhelmi ng demand 
from tuden ts and many shi rts were 
distributed without them . 

Even with out th e accompanying 
pamphlets, the shirts began a grass-
roots campaign to publicize the tent 
that was scheduled to appear on 
campus. The long corr idor entrance 
to the tent stood on Librar y Walk, 
marked by burlap cloth on which 
quotation s and pictures of chil -
d ren had been painted. The tent 
was nperated by volunteers for 24 
hours a day, whi h allowed students 
to exper ience the life of children 
affected by th e HIV epidemic no 
matter the time. 

The people that were 
against [the Itnpactl 
tent] were the people 
that were against us 

bringing up 
spirituality?' 

- Tyler Allred, 
Inter-Varsity Member 

Before comlllg to UCSD, the tent 
had been hosted by Southwestern 
College, Mira Costa Coll ege and Cal 
State San Marcos. After UCSD, the 
University of Southern Cali fo rn ia 
and San Diego State Universi ty are 
slated to host the tent. I nterVar ity 
fund raiscd to pay fo r the expenses 
of the tent. 

One of the members of the 
Inte rVa rsity Campus Team Mi nistry, 
Tyler Allred, was excited by the reac-
tion of UCSD students, denizens of 
a stereotypi cally apathe tic chool. 

"I was ~urprised at how many 
peoplc ca me, especiall y at two in 
the morning. three In the morning," 
Allred said . InterVarsity es timated 
that 5,000 people walked through 
the d isplay. Th~ stories in th e tent, 
called li felines, fea tu red both chil -

dren infec ted with H IV a well as 
those affected by AI DS. The chil -
d ren featured in the ten t we re real 
child ren wit h rea l stories, so me of 
whom are st ill a li ve. Oliv ia , a 17-
year-o ld Ma lawian girl. was raped 
twice by the same man. Another 
story was that of Beatrice, a 7 -year-
old Zam bian girl who took over 
care of her sister 's infa nt daughter, 
altho ugh both had recently been 
orphaned . 

The heart-wrenching issue has 
evoked some con flict over m eth ods 
of acti vism. 

Furidraisi ng co ncerns we re 
voiced by a Facebook group fo rmed 
to express opposi t ion to the Im pact 1 
program and c rit ique the usc of 
$70,000 in the const ructio n of th e 
tent. Crit ics contend ed that that 
m uch money is sq uandered on proj -
ects like Impact!, when it might 
have had a more immed iate effect as 
aid given d irec tly to AI DS victims. 
jacobs responded to the critiqu e 
with a hope for the future. 

" [The] $70,000 is insignificant 
when compared to the 5,000 s tu -
denb that went through th e tent;' he 
sai d. "If we can at leas t impact on e 
stud ent, it's wo rth the $70,000." He 
went on to desc ribe the poss ibility 
th at s tudents on campus will be in 
po it ions to make a change in the 
AIDS pandemic and the Impact 1 
program may in fo rm thei r dec ision 
to help. 

An other co ncern rega rded th e 
second element used to go beyond 
awa rencss - spirituality. Jacobs 
explai ned the intentional desig n of 
the tents. 

"We really tri ed to not d o a bait -
and -swi tch;' he said. " We had a pre-
tent that ex plain ed wh at the experi -
t:nce would bc like .. . we had a pro-
cess to help the students unders tand 
the ex peri ence they were stepping 
into." 

Allred echoed jacobs' intent. "We 
tried our best to ma ke sure everyo ne 
knew exactly wh at they were ge tt ing 
int o," Allred said . "There were some 
negative reac ti ons. Any negat:iv ity 
that was there wasn' t much, but the

Junior captain Jared Lang admitted 
that despite these pressures, a lot of the 
performance expectations come from 
his personal standards. 

"I think my biggest competition is 
myself. trying to find a level in which 
I feel 1 am surfing my best; Lang said 
"Surfing is a Ieaming process. Every 
wave is different and requires a differ-
enl strategy." 

Mayberry also made an attempt to 
describe the glory of the barrel. "It's a 
feeling of being in the perfect place at 
the perfect time," he said "It's like a 
heaven on earth:' 

The Tritons hosted the first of six 
competitions in the NSSA season on 
Oct. 21-22 at Black's Beach, finishing

While this sounds like a dream 
for many people, it came at a physical 
price. During his career, Lang - who is 
currently injured - has overcome bro-

but none of these maJadies could stop 
him from pursuing his passion. 

"Though I have gotten hun a few

A highlight of the competition was 
when junior Lauren Sweeney took the 
first-place spot out of six surfers in her 
heat of the women's division. 

While each surfer has their own 
story, records, and motivation for 
surfing on the UCSD team, they are 
all united by a deep respect for the 
power of ocean's waves which fuel 
their unique abilities and ambitions. 

"I know that I can never be in com-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2006 

Men's Squad Falls Short of 
National Championships 

• QUALIfY, from page 1 6 
ted the defending champs against the 
best in the west. 

According to UCSD head coach 
Ted Van Arsdale, the West Reiional 
title was up for grabs as any of the top 
four tearns could have prevailed on the 
day, with a mere 10 points separating 
the top four qualifying teams. 

"That was an incredible compe-
tition;' Varl Arsdale said_ "The four 
teams were so good:' 

Cal State Los Angeles fUlished first 
with 67 points over Seattle Pacific 
University with 70 points. UCSD fin-
ished with 76 points, which was good 
enough to beat out Chico State. 

Seattle Pacific University freshmarl 
Jessica Pixler cut the tape with a first-
place tinle of 20 minutes. 46.1 seconds 
over Chico State enior Mary Torres 
arld Central Washington Univer ity 
junior Katie Hummel. 

Cal State Los Angeles took the 
title with impressive fourth -, fifth-
arld seventh-place finishes by senior 
Pilar Delgado, junior Karla Alburez 
and senior Maija Rhode, respectively. 
Cal State Los Angeles fmished second 
in the CCAA championship with five 
runners in the top 15. 

Junior team captain Diane Dunn 
was the first Thton to cross the line, 
coming in at sixth place with a time of 
21 :31.05. Junior Emily McGregor fin-
ished 10th with a time of 21:47.41. 

Dunn said that the team was well 
aware that the race would be tOllgh. 

"We knew for the three top spots 
we were going to have to run hard;' 
Dunn said_ 

Both Dunn and McGregor quali-
fied for the All-West Region team, 
whiell is composed of the top 15 run-
ners of the day. 

The Lady Tritons also finished 
third in the CCAA championships on 
Oct. 21, failing to repeat their previ-

ous standing as Chico State regained 
its title. The Wildcats have won four 
CCAA titles in the last five years. 

Coming off their best campaign in 
Division II competition, the Tritons 
have had to jump some hurdles this 
season in replacing three of its top 
seven runners, including former 
All-American team captain Mimi 
Hodgins. 

Despite these issues, this season's 
team isn't running on empty. 

"Our teanl is just as good as last 
year;' Dunn said. "I know if we run as 
well as we did today that .,. we could 
be succes fu)~ 

On the men's side, the team fa.iled to 
qualify for the national championships 
for the third straight year by finishing 
fifth at the West Regionals_ 

Only the top three fmishers in the 
West Regionals. 

Chico State blew away the compe-
tition on the men's side with a score 
of 32_ AU five of Chico State's top 
runners finished in the top 15, which 
is an amazing feat, given that the near-
est competitor was Cal Poly Pomona, 
which garnered 116 points and had 
only one top-IS runner in the race. 

Freshman Jesse Morrill finished 
first for the Tritons in II th place with a 
time of 33:05.27_ 

For the women's team, the West 
Regionals was a stepping stone on 
the way to this month's national 
championship race, arld the chance 
to improve on last season's perfor-
mance_ 

"[It was aJ gr!!at competition, and 
Chico [State J put on a terrific meet; 
Van Arsdale said. "The objective was 
to qualify and go on." 

With the West Coast hurdles 
behind them, the Lady Tritons will 
travel to Pensacola, Fla. for the NCAA 
Division II National Championship 
on Nov. 18.

[Seattle Pacific University] .» 

Only 30 seconds later. Cochran 
put the team up by three, scoring on 
a strike from 18 yards out. 

The ball tipped off the Western 
Washington University keeper and 
just crossed the goal line before a 
Viking defender could reach it. 

"I didn't think it was going in 
because I didn't get enough power 
because it was my left foot and off

did. I was pretty excited:' 

Junior defender Nicole Pepper 
scored for the Tritons, netting her 
first goal of the season in the 88th 
minute to cement the UCSD vic-

The Triton defense did an out-

According to McManus, the 
defense's success comes from its 
cohesiveness and team mentality. 

"They don't get themselves in 
trouble so they don't have to be the 
fastest or biggest; he said. "Tirey 
pass well and they pinch the ball 
well and they stand up players and 
rarely get beat.» 

UCSD moved onto the finals 
against Seattle Pacific University, a 
rematch from last year's Division 
II Far West regionals, which the 

Falcons won 2-0 en route to eventu -
ally finishing second place in the 
national title match. 

McManus said that last year's bit-
ter disappointment has le.ft much to 
be desired for this year~s campaign. 

· We felt last year, we outplayed 
them and didn't score;' he said . "We 
knew it would be a very even game. 
The defense took away their two 
great chances and we created four or 
five great chances and scored.» 

The Tritons, like the previous 
game, struck first with a corner kick 
from junior midfieider 'Caitlin Ryan. 
The kick fooled Falcon goalkeeper 
Kat ie Ruggles as the ball went sailing 
over her head untouched into the far 
corner. putting UCSD up 1-0. 

In the second haLf, senior mid -
fielder Megan Dickey collected a 
cross from Sepulveda and blasted 
it to the low left corner in the 57th 
minute for a 2-0 lead . 

Cochran, who played a key role 
on Dickey's goal, faking out two 
defenders and by allowing Dickey an 
open shot, scored her own goal 10 
minutes later, pushing UCSD's lead 
to 3-0 for the Triton win. 

"It was a little bit less about the 
team and more about getting past 
the second round; Cochran said. 
"I just wanted to beat whoever we 
played so we could move on. It didn't 
matter that it was Seattle Pacific, we 
just wanted to win.» 

The Tritons move on to play 
Metropolitan State College of 
Denver, which beat SI. Edward's 
University in the Midwest Regional 
Final. 

Metro State will host UCSD on 
Nov. II in the quarterfinal match, 
and McManus knows the pressure 
will build as the team moves deeper 
into the NCAA tournament. 

· The teams are only going to get 
better; McManus said.

Tritons' slow start in the match 
against the Toreros. 

"We let them in the match too 
early; O'Hara said. · We didn't come

Cherwink echoed the sentiment. 
"USD came out fired up and really

estimated them and we were caughl 
off guard and had to play catch-up. 
We had a strong comeback and we 
came out on top. The team didn't

With the two wins over the 
weekend, the Tritons are 4-0 this 
preseason and excited about the

Tritons Decimate Western Foes 
Women's soccer squad 
shuts out two straight 
divisional opponents 
to advance to NCAA 
quarterfinals. 

By Matt Croskey 
STAFF WRITER 

The NCAA Division II Far West 
Regional Championship is supposed 
to pit the area's four best teams against 
one another. If this i true, Western 
Washington University and Seattle 
Pacific University will plead no con-
test to the UCSD women's soccer 
team being named the best team in 
its region. 

The Triton dominated regional 
competition, shutting out Western 
Washington University 4-0 and Seattle 
Pacific University 3-0 on Nov. 2 and 

ov. 4, respectively. 
"[Seattle Pacific University] had 

great chances but couldn't score," 
enior midfielder Kelly Cochran said. 

"Everyone had a great attitude and 'put 
forth an awesome effort and we won:' 

The Tritons extended their unbeat-
en streak to 15 games, going 13-0-2 
during the stretch, run ning the overall 
record to 20- 1-2. 

"We've done what we've needed to 
do:' head coach Brian McManus said. 
"There are some games where wive 
played ugly but we've won. You're not 
going to play pretty every game but if 
you come out with the win, that's what 
matters:' 

UCSD matched up against Western 
Washington University in the semifi-
nal match on Nov. 2 and struck early. 
Junior forward Kathy Sepulveda took 
a throw-in, strode down the sideline, 
crossed up a Viking defender and net-
ted her II th goal ' of the season to 
put the Tritons up 1-0 in the eighth 
minute. 

Sepulveda added her second goal 
of the game in the 49th minute off a 
Vtking turnover. The goal put UCSD

Foes for City Crown 

ByJoo Yoon 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

In a battle to earn the title of 
San Diego's top collegiate rugby 
squad, the UCSD men's rugby team 
participated in the San Diego City 
Championships on Nov. 3, which 
included teams from the University 
of San Diego, San Diego State and 
Point Loma Nazarene University. 

In the fust game, the Tritons 
faced off against fierce rival SDSU 
and defeated the Aztecs soundly 
with a score of27-5. 

Coach Paul Reynolds was excit-
ed about the team's overwhelming 
victory. 

"SDSU has always been a chal-
lenge for us," he said. "We haven't 
beaten them for 5 or 6 years." 

Senior captain and inside center 
Nik Cherwink concurred. 

"This was the first time we beat 
[San Diego) State since I've been 
here," he said. "It's something I've 
been waiting for [for) four years." 

The Tritons struck first in the 
fust half with Cherwink scoring 
a try in the 10th minute, then 10 
minutes later, SDSU countered with 
a try but freshman winger Steven 
Marinero negated that score with a 
try in the 25th minute. Junior lock 
Will Cowell, who was two of four 

on kick conversions, punched in 
a penalty kick for the fust points 
of the second half and Cherwink 
added two more tries later on in the 
half - becoming the highest scorer 
of the game with three tries - to 
burySDSU. 

"Nik, once again, led by exam-
ple," Reynolds said. "He carried the 
team to victory:' 

Cherwink, however, deflected 
the praise to his teammates. 

"Steven Marinero was a rookie 
and came out against one of the 
best teams," Cherwink said. "They 
couldn't catch him because he was 
so fast." 

The Tritons consistently gained 
yards deep into enemy territory 
despite having some starters out of 
the tournament due to injuries. 

"The forwards won the game 
for us today," Reynolds said. "They 
allowed our backs to shine. We had 
to move guys around and didn't 
have the strongest positional 15 out 
there because of injuries." 

The second game, however, 
proved much more difficult for 
the Tritons. The University of San 
Diego caught the TritOlll flatfooted 
and scored two early tria in the 
fint half, putting the Tritona in I
