Students Oppose Prop 9 in Poll 
91% of UC Students Against, 840/0 Believe Tuition Would Result 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Correapondent 

A survey of UC students shows 91 
percent of those polled oppose 
Proposition 9 and 84 percent believe 
that tuition would result if the tax 
cutting initiative passes in June. 

The survey also revealed . that 81 
percent of UC students are registered 
to vote. Secretary of State March F ong 
Eu announced last week that 66 
percent of the voting age population 
had registered. 

A question on last week's AS ballot 
showed 91 percent of UCSD students 
voting in the election are against the 
initiative. 

The telephone poll of 142 randomly 
selected students from the nine UC 
campuses was conducted by the 
California Council for Students' 
Educational Needs, a group of students 
from ue, the state and community 
colleges. 

It was conducted one month after 
UC President David Saxon sent a letter 
to every UC student advising that 
tuition would probably be imposed if 
the voters approved Prop. 9. Saxon 
has been severely criticized for using 
$30,000 in state monies to print and 
mail the letters, which many Prop. 9 
proponents construed as campaign 
material. 

The result of the CCSE poll seemed 
to indicate that Saxon's message was 
effective. 

"It had an impact in that it clearly 
brought home to the students the 
potential effects the passage of Prop. 9 
could have on their lives," said David 
Shontz, UC student lobby co·director. 

Don Swain, UC Vice President of 
academic affairs, said, " It is 
encouraging to learn that so many 
students have informed themselves 
about the issue, and that so large a 
percentage oppose the measure. The 

polls show that students clearly 
understand that tuition could result 
from the passage of Prop. 9." 

While three percent of the students 
polled said they were in favor of Prop. 
9 , only six percent said that they were 
uncertain how they would vote. 

In addition, the large number of 
students who were able to answer the 
detailed questions about the arguments 
being used in the campaign showed 
that UC students had heard of the 
Issue. 

Fifty.nine percent agreed that Prop. 
9 would primarily benefit a few very 
rich taxpayers, and 78 percent thought 
that the measure would cause cutbacks 
in needed government services. Fifty-
seven percent ' disagreed with the 
contention that Prop. 9 would 
stimulate economic growth in 
California. 

"UC students realize this is not a 
good way to cut wastes in state 

government," said Jim Rogers, a 
CCSEN spokesman. 

"The Prop. 9 supporters say it will 
give us something for nothing. UC 
realizes it will give us nothing for 
something, the something being 
tuition." 

Rogers also credits Prop. 9 as being 
the principle reason for so many 
students registering to vote. One 
hundred percent of those polled have 
registered to vote on the Santa 
Barbara, Irvine, Santa Cruz and 
Riverside campuses. Ironically, UC 
Berkeley and Davis which have the 
most concerted registration drives, had 
the fewest registered voters. 

According to Jim Cietz, 
postgraduate researcher in the UC 
Davis sociology department, the 
r~istration figure may be over-
innated, since a series of screening 
questions were not included to read out 
faulty answers. 

'Write In Tambuzi' Drive 
Disallowed By Napell 

President's Council And Lobby 
Meet Administration on Prop 9 

BY ERIC JAYE 
AS Elections Commissioner Bruce Napell announced 

yesterday that he would count no write-in votes in today's AS 
runoff election. 

A campaign had recently been mounted to have Robert 
Cunningham-Tambuzi written in as a presidential candidate. 

T ambuzi could not be reached yesterday, but Jon Bekken of 
the Progressive Coalition, which he. led-the-eampaign, said 
that Napell had "no choice but to allow the votes.'" 

"It's in the codes; they say that the elections commissioner 
must provide for write-in votes." 

NapeU said the codes did state that the commissioner must 
provide for write· ins, but that they were ambiguous as to 
whether that meant for both the general and runoff elections. 

"The codes say that those two with the most votes in the 
general election will have a runoff. We've taken that to mean 
that we should not allow write-ins," he said. 

Napell admitted that he had "waffled" on the write-in 
question at the candidates' meeting, but that he and the 
elections commission had reached their decision after 
searching the codes. 

Bekken said he plans to make a formal appeal concerning 
N apell' s decision. 

Polls for the AS runoff election will be open today from 10 
a m to 4 pm at locations throughout the campus. 

tudent will be choosing officers for six positions including 
president a nd vice-president. 

Daily Guardian Editorial 
Position Election Nears 

Applications for Daily Guardian editorial 
positions are now available. 

The application deadline for editor-in-chief 
has passed, but applications for all other 
editorial positions will be accepted until 
Wednesday, May 14. . 

There will be a general staff meeting this 
Thursday, May 8, at 3 pm in the Daily 
Guardian office to hear statements from the 
candidates for editor. All staff members 
(writers, production . workers, advertising 
staff, etc.) listed in Wednesday's staff box are 
eligible to vote after speeches on Thursday 
and all day Friday. 

The Student Body 
President ' s Council and 
student lobby representatives 
will meet with UC systemwide 
administr ators today to 
discuss the possibility of tuition 
being imposed on UC students 
if Proposition 9 passes. 

- SBPC, composed of reor,eeen,..·_·-
tatives from each of nine 
UC campuses, is advised 
regularly on changes in the 
system that might affect 
students. It formally satisfied a 
top-level UC commitment to 
"student consultation." 

SBPC has proposed a list of 
alternatives to imposition of 
tuition should Proposition 9 
pass, including consolidation 
of academic programs, salary 
penalties to ineffective 
teachers, a four -day 
instruction week, an increase 
in teaching load and sale of 
unused UC-held land. 

"There is no reason 
tudents hould have to pay 

two-thirds of the co t of 
Proposition 9 cuts, which is 
what the univer ity wants us to 

David Shontz 

do," UC lobby co-director 
David Schontz argues. 

AS Presidential candidate 
Linda Sabo will attend the 
meeting on behalf of UCSD, 
as she has been doing all year_ 
Sabo says univ rsily rumors 
she h ar indicat that UC 
President David Saxon may 

be planning on bypassing the 
Regents and going directly to 
the state legislature to impose 
tuition, a possibility "that 
would cause him to lose his 
job." 

Schontz points out that 
while the legislature funds the 

-university, the Regents hire 
and fire, and would probably 
do the latter if Saxon goes 
over their heads. 

But , he added, the 
legislature can add "control 
language" to the UC budget, 
and has done 50 in the past. 

"That's essentially what 
Ronald Reagan did with the 
education fee," he said. "He 
cut the UC budget $30 million 
and said students would 
appreciate their education 
more if they paid for it. That's 
how we got the education fee. " 

And, Schontz noted, the 
legislature has threatened to 
reduce UC funding on a 
proportionate basi to fe 
increa e a a way of keeping 
f es down in some years.

Recruiting Rights 
There is a basic issue of conscience on today's AS 

election run.off ballot. It is the initiative asking students to 
go on record opposing military recruiters doing their work 
on campus. 

TIle illue involved the-abuse of military power and the 
right of conflicting ideas to clash openly. ,----------Letters to the Editor ---------,....-, 

The ballpt question was put forth ~y San Diego Students 
for Peace and students on the AS Council who believe that 
the military has engaged in and will continue to engage in 
actions repugnant to the student community. 

These students are engaged in political action to defeat 
registration for the selective service system, and see this 
initiative as one part of that process. 

Spielmann Pushes Student Rights 
Editor: 

But there are .till many ways to fight the military without 
resorting to infringing on a right we see as more important 
than this political illue - the right of organizations to 
app!oach students on campus freely. 

That right extends to the Hare Krishnas, student 
newspapers, AS candidates, SDSP members and military 
recruiters equally. It is a right that transcends this year's 
fight oyer registration for the draft. Suptl?rting the initiative 
backs the belief that the nation's armed forces do not have 
enough moral rectitide to address the students at this 
wUversity SDSP and the AS would have us believe it can 
be 10 easily corrupted. 

Next year could be either a 
very good or very bad year for 
students . The choice is 
partially up to them. Today 
they wal have the opportunity, 
to some extent, to determine 
which 01 these two shall be ~e 
case. 

You may not like having military recruiters on campus. 
They may be an uncomfortable reminder of our president's 
plan to begin preparations for impressment. They may be 
an uncomfortable reminder that several million people our 
age are shaving their heads and carrying rifles. 

One way that students 
could help encourage a good 
year, i. to vote for Bob 
Spielmann for Student 
Welfare. In thi. capacity Bob 
will be responsible lor 
advocating student rights . 
Already this year he has 
worked to devdop a new 
approach in this area, 
including a large scale 
program to deal with grade But they are a reminder that we have accepted the right 

to choose and discern for ourselves. We urge students to 
vote no. 

Showing Commando Bodies 
Offended Moslems Deeply

the bodies should not be taken as an Islamic

Islam is quite clear about the need for

Iranians , too, far from supporting or 
glorying in the tasteless act , as Americans have 
been led to believe, reacted with a nger and 
disgust. A ccording to telephone interviews with 
officials of National Iranian Radio and 
Television, the switchboard at the central 
Teheran television station nearly exploded with 
indignant ca llers demanding to know why su h 
a grisly and disrespectful act was put on the air. 

wrapped in a white burial shroud belore 
internment. The thought that a person's body 
might be desecrated is a chilling thought for 
Iranians on a human level. Thus the display 01 
the bodies of the American servicemen violated 
their sensibilities on almost every level. 

As America ns we hav e a limited 
understanding of Islam, and it is perhaps the 
fact that the re ligion seems strange to us that 
makes us classify every incomprehensible act 
taking place in Iran as Islamic. The lact that the 
Iranian revolution utilized the rhetoric 01 Islam 
so heavily reinforces this impression. 

The outpouring of Iranian public disgust 
following the event clearly carried the day . The 
previous threat to hang the bodies outside the 
embassy or to hold them in ransom for Iranian 
assets in the United States was quickly 
aba ndoned. 

Still , this sad incident does have an 
explanation, although perhaps not one that will 
ever be satislactory to Americans. 

During the Iranian revolution, when the 
principal military officers involved in the 
shooting of unarmed citizens on the streets of 
Teheran were executed, their bodies were 
displayed to the public to demonstrate that they 
had actually been executed. That was 
necessary becauae many Iranian citizens 
believed that the men somehow would escape 
puni.hment. 

In the case of the American rescue 
operation, one of the principal rumors in 
Teheran was that the operation had never 
taken place, that it waa all a propaganda move 
on the part of the US to lCare Irarnans. 

Furthermore , the fact that Ayatollah 

In fact , Islam served primarily as a 
convenient symbolic umbrella which covered 
many of the eco nomic and politica l 
dissatisfactions felt by the Iranian public toward 
the regime of the shah. 

The mosque was one 91 the few places where 
people could gather legally and thus it was a 
natural center lor assembling to marshal 
demonstrations In opposition to the 
government. Religious rhetoric and the 
philosophy of glorification of martyrdom served 
to spur the young men from the city to fight , 
even when unarmed, against the troops of the 
shah. 

But there i. another side to religion in Iran. 
Although religiou. ideal. are glorified there, the 
rank and file of the Islamic clergy i. viewed in a

Sabo Record Includes Long 
List of Struggles, Services 
Editor: 

I remember the first time I saw Linda Sabo. She was 
addressing students on Revelle Plaza about draft registration. 
It was during the huge anti-dralt rally where some 2500 
studenta gathered. Her sincerity and enthusiasm for helping 
students understand the importance and immediacy of draft 
registration struck me . The next time I saw unda was at an AS 
meeting this year; as a member 01 Warren College Student 
Government I was interested in the political issues that AS 
dealt with. Again unda stood out as being very concerned 
about the input of students on such matters as the Chancellor 
Search Committee aelection process . 

Since that time I have spoken to Linda on many important 
subjects affecting all of us at UCSD. Her concern for the 
development of the DaycareCenter, Women's Center, SAAC, 
and College Councils, in addition to such student organizations 
as the ski club, indicate an ability to get along with diversified 
groups, each with its own interests . 

As the newly elected president 01 Warren College Siudent 
Government and the Warren College Council, I have discussed 
with Linda the importance of having input from the college 
councils into AS. She has been most responsive towards this, 
and specifically mentioned as a possible goal, more college 
input into the selection'of Student Center Board members. We 
also discussed the possibility of a rotating chair on Warren 
College Council next year which may serve as a test for other 
committees and bodies of student government. 

Because 01 Linda's immense leadership experience and her 
ability to represent all student' interests fairly , I personally 
endorse her for president 01 the Associated Students.

1980. The referendum lor the 
May 6 ballot should not read 
"shall all military personnel or 
recruiters be denied access to 
UCSD for recruiting

"shall Jon Bekken be allowed

gladly give Mr. Bekken the

Regarding the initiative to

I admire the energy with 
which Bekken promotes hi. 
leeling. about the draft, but by 
leeking to remove military

Bekken IS .howing an 
intolerance for the very

five Ir~an Arab terrorists terrorists, who seized the

They said some of the 19 believed the commando. were 
rescued hostages .uffered equipped with ".tun" grenades 
'shock and cuts. Two other used to immobilize victims 
terrorists were captured alive, with concussion. 
one of them wounded. 

At least two explosions 
rocked the elegant five·story 
building as the Special Air 
Services commandos charged 
in. A fire followed but it was 
soon extinguished. 

"My God, they've done it!" 
said a reporter for the British 
Broadcasting Corp., who 
believed as did many other 
journalists watching the dr ama 
from behind police barricades 
that the terrorists had carried 
out their threat to blow up the 
building. 

Metropolitan Police 
Commissioner Sir David 
McNee said the decision to 
launch the assault was made 
after the Arabs killed two 01 
their captives Monday and 
threatened to kill another 
every half hour if their 
demands were not met. 

Officials reported none of 
the commandos or police was 
wounded in the raid. They 
declined to say how many 
commandos were involved, 

One of the toughest 
problems lacing British 
officials trying to negotiate an 
end to the siege was the 
Iranian government's refusal 
to negotiat e. 

The terrorists initially had 
said they would kill all the 
hostages if Iran's revolutio-
nary Islamic government did 
not free 91 imprisoned Iranian 
Arabs. 

Khomeini ' s government 
had refused to negotiate and 
threatened to kill one of the 
Khuzestan prisoners lor each 
hostage slain. 

The British Foreign 
Ministry said it had received 
Iran's permiasion to storm the 
embassy "if neceasary." 

In Washington, the State 
Department expressed regret 
at the deaths 01 the hostages 
and said the incident "also 
underlines the', deep concern 
Ielt by the American people 
and the American government 
for the Americans held 
hostage in Iran."

Flexible Interest 
Mortgages OKd 

SACRAMENTO - Amid 
warnings that home mortgage 
financing would vanish 
otherwise, the Assembly 
passed a bill yesterday that 
would allow mortgage interest 
rates to be periodically 
readjusted by as much as 5 
percent during a 30-year loan. 

"If we do not allow this type 
of financing," warned -the 
author, Aasemblyman Alister 
McAlister, "there is a serious 

question if there i. going to be 
a home lending industry in this 
country." 

Hi. bill, AB3142, waa 
approved 56-4 and aent to the 
Senate, which is conaidering 
another proposal to allow 
flexible interest rates. 

Currently, a potential 
homeowner can get a 

~rtgage at the prevailing 
mterest rate, about IS to 18 
percent, or get a variable rate 
mortgage under which the 
interest rate - and thus the 
payments - can vary up or 
down 2112 percent depending 
on the market .

LOS ANGELES - wt·

poatponement yesterday of the 
long. awaited preliminary 
hearing lor accused Hillside 
Strangler Angelo Buono. 

Superior Court Judge H. 
Randolph Moore Jr. 
rescheduled te.timony to

dispute over whether the 
public and press may_ attend 
the proceedings is likely to '

Buono, the 45·year·old

women, did not appear. Aher 
conferring with him in a 
holding cell, his attorneys 
announced he had waived his 
right to be present. 

Court appointed defense 
attorney Gerald Chaleff said 
the delay came because two 
issues are still on appeal -
Buono's request for public 
funds to pay his private

consolidation can lead to 
greater efficiency and an 
improvement in the quality of 
the federal government's 
contribution to education. She 
maintains that giving 
education Cabinet·level status 
i. a long·overdue acknow-
ledgement of the importance it 
carries in this society. 

"In retrospect, it's surprising 
that it took us 200 years to 
decide that education is as 

important as housing or 
transportation or other illues 
that were at the Cabinet table 
before us," .he ,aid last week. 

"I think we can give a 
driving force to the kind of 
creativity and ingenuity to be 
found in ... many people who 
are not often heard from ." 

The new department is 
destined to grow quickly . It will 
be formally joined by the old 
Overseaa Dependent Schools 
program. which is being 
removed from the Defense 
Department. About 11.000 
personnel go with this 
educational segment and the 
department has up to three 
years in which to arrange the 
merger which win raise iu

UC Nutrition Education Program Denounced 
Congressional Subcommittee Criticizes California's 
One-to-One System; Extension Service Defends It 

BY MONICA GIESEN 
Staff Writer 

The denunciation of the 
Universitr of California's 
nutritiona education program 
by a congressional subcom-
mittee may lead to the 
suspension of its federal 
funding. 

At a May 21 hearing in Los 
Angeles , a congressional 
agricultural subcommittee 

expressed dissatisfaction with 
the management of the 
Expanded Food and Nutrition 
Education Program sponsored 
by UC's Cooperative 
Extension Service, claiming 
that it is "probably the worst-
administered program in the 
nation of its kind."

Parapsychology PhD 
Awarded at B~rkeley 

BY MARK WILSON 
Staff Writer 

On UC commencement 
day in June, a Berkeley 
graduate student will make 
academic history when he 
steps forward and receives 
his doctorate. I n fact, until 
several years ·ago; what 
Jefferey Mishlove had 
studied was considered more 
of a simple occult fanaticism 
than an involved university 
major . . 

Mishlove is the first 
candidate for a doctorate in 
parapsr,chology - a 
"science' which deals with 
things not ordinarily thought 
to be of this world. 

According to the Journal 
of Parapsychology , the 

subject is the study of 
" behavioral or personal 
exchanges with the 
environment which are 
extrasensorimotor - not 
dependent on senses and 
muscles." More simply. it is 
the study of ESP and 
psychokinesis. In the past, 
UC officials have not 
accepted it as a full -fledged 
science. 

Mishlove applied for his 
doctorate as an individual. 
ized degree and not through 
a structured program. Some 
of the courses he completed 
for his degree included ethics, 
experimental methodology,

Funds for the organization

government in proportion to 
the rural population of the 
state. with California receiving 
$50 million of the share per 
year. 

The university also 
contributes a certain amount. 
as does the county 
government. which provides 
support services for a county 
office. According to Victor 
Brown, Director of CES in San 
Diego County. Presidio 
County receives the most 
funds - $139.000 a year _ 
for the program from the 
county level. 

The Expanded Food and 
Nutrition Education Program. 
one part of CES's services, is 
the program under question by 
the subcommittee. 

According to Brown: "Back 
in 1916. when they discovered 
that there was malnutrition in

nutritional education aid to the 
poor. The thrust of the 
program was to get an 
education resource to the low 
income families ." 

The program gives selected 
homemakers in the commu. 
nity nutritional training, who 
are then sent to highly 
populated, impoverished 
regions. There they visit needy 
famaies and give them "basic 

knowledge on feeding their

Brown.

Abortion Bill Bad News 
For Unwed Teen Mothers 

Cuban Refugees Find HODles 
In Florida's Makeshift City 

SACRAMENTO - Un-
wed minors could not get 
abortions in California without 
approval of their parents or a 
court if a bill sent to the Senate 
floor Monday becomes law. 

The measure, 581814 by 
Sen. John Schmi17., R-Corona 
del Mar, cleared the Senate 
Finance Committee on a 7-5 
vote. 

However, an amendment 
added by the committee would 
scrap the bill if Proposition 9, 
Howard Jarvis' income tax cut 
initiative, is approved by 
voters June 3. The committee 
has been adding that provision 
to most bills that increase 
government costs. 

However, abortion-rights 
groups won on another front 
yesterday when Sen. Joseph 
Montoya, D -Whittier, 
withdrew a bill that would have 
required a 24-hour waiting 
period for non-emergency 

abortions. 
The bill, SB691, also would 

have required the doctor to tell 
the woman what effects the 
abortion would have on her 
and the fetus.

psychology is far from 
becoming an accepted 
science. Even though the 
American Auociation for 
the Advancement of Science 

has recognized it as such, 
only 200 universities offer 
undergraduate courses in the 
subject. 

Only one accredited 
school offers a bachelor's 
and a master's degree in it 
and that institution is John F. 
Kennedy University in 
Orinda, where Mishlove 
teaches. And only 30 
students are following a 
parapsychology course of 
study there.

northwestern Florida tent city 
may begin moving into 
American towns by Tuesday, 
officials say. 

"That's a darn good 
possibility, " site director 
Norman Steinlauf of the 
Federal Emergency Manage· 
ment Agency said Monday. 
The federal agency is 
coordinating all federal 
activities in the processing. 

The four-acre makeshift 
tent community, just a few 
miles from downtown Fort 
Walton Beach, continues to 
grow as hundreds of military 
engineers and construction 
workers labor around the 
dock to erect 18-by-52-foot 
tents which house 25 to 35 
people. 

More that 2,000 refugees 
were packed into the center by 
midday Monday and another 
500 were expected by day's 
end, being flown from Key 

[ 

West, the entry point into this 
country. 

Reportedly among the 
refugees at the tent c.itv was 
71-year-old Regina Antonia 
Juana Cugat, who said she 
was a sister of band leader 
Xavier Cugat. The slight, 
white-haired woman could not 
immediately be interviewed for 
details. 

Janice Pittman of the US 
Catholic Conference said 
sponsors have been found for 
up to 15,000 refugees who 
may go through this center. 

Mrs. Pittman said 
communities throughout the 
Southeast had contacted her 
office to sign up for refugee 
sponsorship. 

"For instance, the Cuban 
community on Orlando has 
asked for 300 to 400 
refugees," she said. "We 
expect to place about 100 to 
150 in Tallahassee."
