Veteran Reporter Arnett 
Talks War, Journalism 
• eNN's man in Baghdad discusses 
his experience in covering conflicts 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Associate News Editor 

Walking into a room full of 
journali ts ye terday , Cable 
News Network (CNN) corre-
pondent Peter Amett eated hirn-

selfin the first row ,casually chat-
ting with the assembled reporters 
while waiting for the televi ion 
crews to fini h etting up their 
equipment. 

TIle man who has covered a 
variety of subjects, including the 
first shots fired in the Vietnam 
and Persian Gulfwars, was about 
to become the subject of a press 
conference on the first stop of his 
whirlwind tour of UCSD. 

In addition to the press con-
ference, Arnett spoke to a gather-
ing of graduate students and 
members of Communication/ 
Political Science Professor 
Daniel Hallin's American News 
Media class. He also gave a lec-
ture and answered questions last 
night to a Main Gym packed with 
students and community mem-
bers. 

A journalist for thirty years, 
Amett spent 15 years in south-

ea t Asia as well a places like I -
rael, Iran, and the oviet Union. He 
described the differen e between 
working in Vietnam, where there 
wasnomediacen orship,and work-
ing in Baghdad, where CNN's foot-
age was heavily edited by the Iraqi 
government. 

"It was Vietnam where ... I re-
ally learned how to cover wars. I 
was hot at, I was in the field, my 
feet got dirty," Arnett said. "In 
Baghdad, I was living in a big mod-
em hotel, looking at the war from 
the ninth floor, with room ervice 
part of the time, a storeroom full of 
goodies that CNN had shipped in .... 
It didn' t seem real to me." 

"Toward the end of the war we 
got these night len devices that we 
could just aim out the window and 
you get all those pretty pictures," he 
continued. 

Arnett said that the one story he 
wanted to cover was the situation in 
Kuwait, but was barred from doing 
so by the Iraqi government. 

Most of the journalists were not 
ordered out by the United States 
government, but by their own news 
organizations. Amett said that while 

Jennifer Kolsky/Guardian 

Peter Arnett, CNN's Baghdad reporter during the early days of 
the Gulf War, discussed his experiences - including his interview 
with Saddam Hussein - last night at UCSD. 
the reason given for such a move 
was concern for the safety of the 
employees, he believed that it was 
more for fear of political repercus-
sions back home . 

"Two or three reporters [cover-
ing the Kurds in Iraq] have been 
killed in the last few weeks when 
none died during the war, so I think 
that safety was less a consideration 
than political [motives], but they 
won't admit it," he said. 

Amett was the only We temjour-
nalist to have the opportunity to 
interview Iraqi President Saddam 

Hu ein during the war. 
" It was stressful. After all, he 

i the ' Butcher of Baghdad '," 
Arnett aid. "On the other hand, 
he had given lots of other inter-
views earlier to Dan Rather, to 
CNN, to Bernard Shaw, 0 I knew 
that it was po ible to interview 
him and survive the experience. 

"I went in knowing that it was 
the most important interview of 
my life at the most critical time," 
he continued. I figured I had bet-
ter make it a good interview."

Changes Made for ISIS 
System's Second Quarter 
• Still more alterations planned; 
Some criticize waitlisting system 
By Wileen Wong 
Guardian Reporter 

As UCSD students began registering for their Fall Quarter 
classes this week, officials in the Regi trar' and Bursar's office 
said they have improved the new ISIS computer system since 
last quarter, and ugge ted that even more change were on the 
way. 

The ISIS system, first conceived ix years ago, wa used for 
the first time last quarter as students registered for thei r Spring 
Quarter courses. Since then, a number of change and improve-
ments have been made to ISIS 's telephone regi tration system 
and the accounts receivable system, according to UCSD Bursar 
Howard Fi her and UCSD Registrar and Admis ions Officer 
Ron Bowker . 

"[Students] found a number of things burdensome," Bowker 
said, referring to the ISIS system's lengthy telephone registra-
tion process. "It took a minimum of half an hour to [register]." 

According to Bowker, a number of local changes have been 
made to the system which will cut telephone registration time 
down. 

Bowker explained that ISIS operates differently from the 
previous system because it was "a package developed in re-
sponse to the needs of four campuses," namely UCSD, Colo-
rado State University, Eastern Michigan Univer ity, and South-
east Louisiana University. 

"This system is one of the rno t advanced in the United 
State . Les than five percent of all universities have this 
system," Fisher said. Other campuse that are interested in 
developing a registration system like ISIS are UC Berkeley and 
UC Irvine, he explained.

inclinations, enjoyed yesterday's warm weather on the Hump as pro-

When ISIS was u ed for telephone regi tration last quarter, 
it required students to enroll in lectures as well as in each of the 
related section .

Water Conservation Improved in 
March; Efforts Must Continue 

ucso was able to reduce water use for the month of 
March by 35 percent from the 1989 base, a reduction 
significantly helped by heavy rains and reduced activity 
on campus during exam week and spring break. 

Continued effort and the active support of everyone on 
campus will be needed to maintain this level of conserva-
tion. Roughly one third of UCSD's water is used in 
residential facilities. Another one-third is used in the 
research laboratories and classrooms. 

Maintenance personnel are continuing to install re-
duced flow devices on toilets, faucets, and showers. but 
the most effective re ults have come from individual 
awareness and personal conservation efforts. 

Although all irrigation was off for the entire month of 
March, some watering is now being re umed under strict 
guidelines. 

The irrigation system will not be used until plants begin 

The UCSD Guardian 

to show igns of tress and soil probes indicate that more water 
is needed. Irrigation schedules are also being monitored to 
ensure that water use does not exceed reasonable tandards. 

UCSO's program is a cooperative effort of many individu-
al and departments, with major commitments by Phy ical 
Plant Services, Housing and Dining Services, and Facilities 
Design and Construction. 

The program is coordinated by Bill Pettus, the water 
management officer at Physical Plant Services.

read "ind.ividuals from student ethnic organizations." 
The Guardian regrets the error.

ISIS 
Continued from page 1 
for [UCSDJ." 

Bowker added that registration 
for Fall Quaner classes will return 
to the past fonnat, in which students 
will no longer have to register for 
both the lecture and the eetion. The 
ystem will, however, continue to 

use the ix-<iigit code because other 
institutions prefer the six-digit sys-
tem. 

According to Bowker and Fisher, 
there is currently a plan to improve 
the ISIS accounts receivable sys-
tem. The first step was to move 
cashiering activities from the Hous-
ing Office to the Central Cashier's 
Office, a1lowi ng students to pay both 
housing and registration fees at the 
same time and place, Fisher ex-
plained. 

The second step was to move the 
distribution of registration stickers 
up several weeks, which was made 
possible through the simplification 
of registration payments. 

According to Fisher, all students 
will have to do will be to make out 
a check for the amount of the fee 
invoice and return it with the top of 
the invoice by mail or in person to 
the Central Cashier's Office. Finan-
cial aid will automatically be ap-
plied to registration fees, and stu-
dents on financial aid will be auto-
matically registered. 

The third step was to have all 
student indebtedness and billing re-
poned on a monthly statement, in a 
system similar to Visa or Master-
card bills, Fisher said. 

"Virtually all campus bills will 
be paid through the invoice system 
at the [CentralJ Cashier's Office. 
This includes registration, housing, 
parking, summer session, and mis-
cellaneous bills. The Bursar's of-
fice has named thi concept, 'one-
stop shopping' ," Fisher said. 

According to Fisher, the system 
is continuing to be refined. Besides 
the eventual electronic wiring of 
financial aid to the [SIS accounts 
receivable system, Fi her said that 
he intends to "make it all as easy as 

pos ible for the students. In a 'best 
of all possible worlds' scenario, 
much of the tudent's business will 
be done telephonically." 

Bowker said that there will be 
improvements toother facets oflSIS. 
Forexample, card readers have been 
installed at the registrar to make the 
add/drop process faster than the 
former key-entry format, although 
students will still have the new op-
tion of adding and dropping classes 
through ISIS. 

Other changes will include in-
creasing the speed of regi tration, 
adding almost twice the number of 
lines currently installed (from 32 to 
48 or 64 lines) depending upon the 
availabil ity of equipment. The new 
lines are expected to be in taIled in 
time for regi tration for winter of 
1992. 

Bowker said that students will 
also be able to dial the registration 
system for their gradt',s instead of 
waiting for the mailing. Bowker 
added that this option could be avail-
able by next spring. 

According to James Lau, an ad-
ministrative assistant at the Depart-
ment of Biology Student Affairs 
Office, the department i concemed 
with the ISIS wait-listing option. 

"The waiting list is useless on 
ISIS," Lau said. 

Lau explained that ISIS places a 
student on the waiting list, but not 
on a first-come-first-served basis. 
Rather, the list is in alphabetical 
order, serving as a guide to depan-
ments for the approximate number 

The UCSD Guardian 

of students interested in the cia 's, 
Lau aid. 

He added that tudent are not 
automatically placed into class open-
ing ,but rather they mu t go to the 
individual depanment to be placed 
on a departmental waiting list. The 
student must monitor cia e to ee 
if there are any openings. 

"There are more problems now 
with the ISIS system. These prob-
lems are happening with lots of dif-
ferent departments," Lau said. . 

According to Bowker, the cur-
rent waitli t program i designed 10 
work in conjunction with academic 
departments. Eaeh department may 
have different criteria for the stu-
dents they admit into clas es. 

"An example may be that some 
departments will only take seniors 
or upper-divi ion stud nt for cer-
tainclasses,'·Bowkersaid. It isupto 
each department to set its own pa-
rameters and hoo e which students 
will fill class openings. 

Bowker also said that students 
often 10 e intere t in a class or dis-
cover that they have signed up for 
other c1as es which conflict with 
the class they waitlisted. 

"What does' waitlist' mean to a 
student? ... A student may waitlist a 
half-dozen courses," Bowker said. 

According to Bowker, [SIS does 
have the potential to waith t tu-
dents on a first-come-first- erved 
basis, but negotiations with aca-
demicdepartments is preferred. This 
way each depanment can detem1ine 
its own waitlist prognuTl, he said.

That is n t to ~a that terrible thing -don't

Yet, the harsh reality of the situation i

Women, however, do need such a center. 
One out of eve!)' fo ur women will be raped. 
Two out of those four will experience some sort 
of sexual harassment, either in school or at work . 

These statistic point out that mallY women 
will be confronted by a situation, sexual or 
otherwise, that a man will never have to face. 
Thus, it i vital that women have some pIa e to 
tum to for help or information. 

And a women 's center i not merely de igned 
to deal with crises of a sexual nature. 

It mai n functi ons are to provide students and 
faculty with education and re earch, infoIlTIation 
and referral. as well as support for networking 
among all women at UCSD.

women's center that is affiliated with other 
student service, a well as with off-campus 
organizations. 

One of the e center's primary function i to 
act as an intermediary between the student and 
potential sources of aid. 

People will always claim 10 know what to do 
and where to tum to in a hypothetical "what if' 
scenario. However, when the crisis hits, most 
people will be 10 I in a quagmire of conflicting 
emotion and socially-programmed reactions.

• The Women's Resource Center is a political organization 
and should not be given funds to spread propaganda 
By Zachary Berman 
Staff Writer 

The Women's Resource Center (WRC) is 
unquestionably a political organization. Whether 
it is an issue dealing with the war, abortion, or 
women's rights, the WRC will be there. In fact, 
rarely does a rally or panel on these or any other 
political topic arise without a spokesperson from 
the WRC airing her view. 

For example. members of the WRC are 
responsible for the posting of "this offends 
women" stickers on campus flyers that it deems 
politically incorrect - as though they speak for 
all women. 

Like any other student organization, the 
WRC has every right to express its political 
views, but as an As ociated Students-funded 
organization, it does not have the right to deny 
some students the freedom to attend its events. 

Interestingly enough, the WRC has denied some 
students the right to 
attend ils functions. 

What I find most 
troubling was its 
recent party whose 
flyer explicity stated: 
"no males allowed." 
This party was 
exclusive, sexist, 
and under the 
auspices of the A.S. 

Considering that 
the event came on the 
heels of the recent 

The WRC. because 
of its strong political 

and anti-male 
stance, creates a 
hostile and intimi-

dating environment, 

controversy surrounding the all male Skull and 
Crossbones society, this is truly ironic. This is hy-
pocrisy at its finest. Aside from the political aspect of

the organization, the WRC's atti-
tude toward men, who just so hap-
pen to make up a large ponion of the 
student body, is very sexist. In the 
WRC library, there is an oppressive 
and draconian cache of literature. 

While most books were embod-
ied with blatant, "Down with men! 
Up with women'" overtones, one 
boolc in panicular summed up the 
general thrust and mcXie of the ma-
terial. It was entitled Why Males 
Exist, 

As I thumbed through the tome, 
I came upon a very enlightening 
section - a comparison between 
male behavior panems and those of 
insects. One can only imagine the 
response from the WRC if there was 
an A.S. funded organization, with 
an office on campus, that had within 
its confutes material of the inflam-
matory and sexist nature that the 
WRCdoes. 

For example, an equivalent text 
in the hypothetical Male Resource 
Center, such as Why Women Belong 
Barefoot and Pregnant, would 
quickly bring to life all their finely 
honed protesting skills. 

'The WRC, because of its strong 
political and anti-male stance, cre-
ates a hostile and intimidating envi-
ronment. Its reactionary politics tran-
scends gender boundaries, and, not 
swprisingly, I have found that a 
large number of women are not in 
accord with its rigid and convoluted 
ideology. 

Indeed, as one junior at UCSD 
stated, "[The WRC] is damaging to 
the status of women on our campus 
and if it came down to it, I would 
seek off -campus counseling instead 
of going to the WRC." 

One may wonder why anorgani-
zarion such as this is being consid-
ered as a recipient for an $87,000 
per year staff counselor. The osten-
sible reason is that the WRC pro-
vides rape counseling and preven-
tion programs. As a result, the WRC 
states the funding it seeks is for 
these services. This is a hard request 
to deny. 

Rape is a horrendous crime. In 
some ways, it is worse than murder. 
Murder has a type of finality about 
it. Rape, on the other hand, contin-
ues. It is a crime that a woman must 
constantly re-live. Tragically, 60 
percent of rape victims experience 
post traumatic stress disorder and 

20 percent anempt suicide. 
'The WRC, fully aware of the 

tragic nature of rape, has capitalized 
on it. Because it has championed the 
cause of rape prevention, it feels the 
money is not only due to it, but it is 
also necessary for "expanding" its 
rape-related programs. 

First of all, the WRC, through its 
ideological actions, has shown it-
self unworthy of the enonnous 
amount of money it is demanding. 
The organization is reactionary, 
oppressive, and unrepresentative of 
thebeHefsof all bUIa small minority 
of the students on our campus. 

In addition, its powerful anti-
male perspective is unhealthy and 
overly persuasive when pressed 
upon a woman who has just been 
raped; it is at this time that a woman 
will be most susceptible to strong 
ideology and propaganda. More-
over, some members of the WRC 
will feed off the rape as a type of 
reassurance that all men are inher-
entlyevil. 

Yet, if the WRC was the only 
place on campus which provided 
these services, there would linle 
choice but to bite the bullet. Fortu-
nately, UCSD's PsycMlogical Ser-
vices provides these programs. 

The WRC's counter to the Psy-
chological Services alternative, as 
well as the main reason behind the 
WRC's demand for a paid coun-
selor, is what it claims to be the 
inefficient treatment Psychological 
Services provides. 

The WRC believes people are 
being "herded through like cattle," 
according to one member, and that 
Psychological Services has a coun-
selortumover rate of about 10 weeks. 
Let us assume, for the sake of argu-
ment, that Psychological Services 
does not provide adequate treatment 
for rape victims. Should the WRC 
then win by default? Of course not. 

The money should go to Psycho-
logical Services with the stipulation 
that it hires a full-time staff coun-
selor. This is the course of action 
that hould be pursued if Psycho-
logical Services is found to be inca-
pableoftreating and preventing mpe. 
For pragmatic reasons alone, Psy-
chological Services would stand as 
a bener place for counseling. 

The WRC is a small office with 
an even smaller room in which its 
members propose to counsel 
women. Moreover, once a woman 

goes through the traumatic experi-
ence of a rape, she does not want to 
find herself in a small office sur-
rounded by Das Capital and Why 
Males Exist. She needs a peaceful 
and unpressured environment, not 
one geared toward a political goal. 

Another point which is brought 
up by proponents of a paid staff 
counselor is the old bandwagon fal -
lacy: "All the other WRCs have 
one, why not us?" 

I don't believe it is necessary to 
show that just because everybody 
else does something, UCSD should 
also - especially considering that 
bener alternatives are available. 

Moreover, it is argued that pro-
viding a paid staff counselor will 
remove the political element from 
the WRC. Proponents claim it will 
cease to be a student run organiza-
tion and become a non-political 
university service. This is hard to 
believe. 

First of all, if the organization is 
really trying to tum over a non-
political leaf, why would it stiU re-
tain the llaJ1Ile "WRC," or simply, 
"The Women's Center"? After all, 
both of these names will recall the 
communist-lesbian stigma which 
remains in the eyes of many stu-
dents . 

Besides, are all the hardcore ac-
tivists going to simply disappear. or 
will they now have more time avail-
able to spread their gospel? What 
about the sexist books that are in the 
WRC? Will they be burned? And 
what abouttheircurrentoffice in the 
Price Center? 

As one can guess, the WRC will 
not cease to be a springboard for 
political and anti-male propaganda 
It will be strengthened, and with the 
power of a full time secretary/coun-
selor, will be able to expand its base. 

If the WRC only cared about 
providing counseling for women and 
did not have other motives behind 
the full-time staff person, it should 
have no problem with the idea of 
setting up a new full-time counselor 
at Psychological Services or even 
expanding and strengthening the 
already existing channels available 
for mpe prevention aIld counseling. 

Imagine if the College Republi-
cans had, as pan of their organiza-
tion, provided rape counseling and 
prevention? Would it then be right 
to provide them with a full-time 
paid staff counselor? Ask the WRC. 

GENDER: Center needs funding to deal 
with certain female crisis situations 
Continued from page 4 

By utilizing the center's network 
of information, a person in need 
may be able to effectively cope with 
the situation and avoid unnecessary 
emotional scarring. The center at 
UCBerkeley, for example, works in 
conjunction with the medical com-
munity and is co-sponsored by aca-
demic departments. 

Paula Goldsmid, the Director of 
UC Irvine's Women's Resource 
Center, swmned up the situation at 
UCSD: "I was absolutely shocked 
to see that [the women's center there] 
was on a purely student-volunteer 
program. [With volunteer workers] 
you lose any type of legitimacy 
needed to influence standing com-
mittees that deal with issues of inter-
est to a women's center. " 

It's an outrage that UCSD is the 
only campus whose women's group 
is run solely by undergraduate vol-
unteers. 'The center is not only un-
derstaffed, but unq ualified to handle 
certain situations that would require 

professionally trained counselors. 
Many are quick to assume that 

the referendum to provide for such 
a position, which passed in the last 
student elections, was nothing more 
than a plug by the UCSD Women's 
Resource Center (WRC) for fund-
ing. 'The proposal, however, came 
about from the Sub-Committee for 
the Chancellor's Status of Women, 
which is comprised of UCSD un-
dergraduates, graduates, faculty ,and 
staff. 

There is a problem on this cam-
pus, and it is called egocentricity. 
People are willing to financially 
support only that which personally 
affects their lives. It was this gath-
ering of your peers and in tructors 
that brought attemion to the current 
lack of a central organizational fo-
cus. 

Once the school 's budget allows 
forthefundingofa women 's center, 
the WRC, as it stands, will retain its 
independent status. It will merely 
selVe as one link in a networking 

web. 
The referendum proposed an an-

nual budget of $87,956. With the 
exception of UC Santa Cruz, this 
amount still falls short of every other 
UCbyatleast$25,OOOperyear. Yet 
the Santa Cruz center cannot be 
utilized as a comparison, for they 
classify their funds differently than 
the other UC campuses. Therefore, 
the women's center at UCSD will 
have to accomplish the same task 
as, say, UC Davis, but with only 
one-third of the financial backing. 

Oearly, this is not a case of re-
verse discrimination. The proposed 
center is not designed to alienate 
people of either gender. Instead, its 
goal is to inform and aid students in 
overcoming the fear and despair 
which is bred through social igno-
rance. 

A woman's center is a prime 
example of a student organizalion 
that, given the budget, could actu-
ally help centralize on-campus ser-
vices.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Revisionists Should Focus on Positive Aspects of History 
Finlan Disputes 
Guardian Editorial 
Editor: 

Editor: 
[n "Whi te Guys Finish Last" 

(May 2), Greg Knau s and James 
Collier gave readers the two differ-
ent views on the interpretation of 
our past. Despite their different per-
pectives, readers were convinced 

on one point: "What ethnic history 
teaches, iNentionally or uninten-
tionally, i 'hatred ... ' 

According to Knaus ,some pro-
fessorofChicanohiSlory "described 
the students in his clas as trees that 
have been pulled to one ide all their 
lives. He said that his job - as a 
teacher - is to pull them ju t as far 
to the opposite ide, so that they can 
stand up straight when released." 

If this " fight propaganda-with-
propaganda" method of teaching 
ethnic history were generally ap-
plied, any students of minority 
group would become as mad as 
James Collier when he got to know 
black hi story and felt, "To say the 
least, I was angry. And I wasn' t 
alone." 

Learning ethnic hi tory must be 
a great experience. However, it 
seems tobe verydifferent from, say, 
leaming western his tory. 

The western historycla~ses I took 
in the pa t gave me a firm under-
tanding oflhe great concepts which 

created the modem world; democ-
racy, freedom, equality, individual-
i m, rights, etc. 

On the other hand, what I re-
member from the clas of black 
history is whites' brutality toward 

black slaves. 
Unfortunately, current teaching 

of ethnic histories does nothing more 
than promote hatred and increase 
tensions anl0ng races. 

I agree with Ralph Waldo 
Emerson when he said in "Ameri -
can Scholar" that "each age, it is 
found, must write its own books; or 
rather, each generation for the next 
succeeding. The books of an older 
period will not fit thi ." 

Maybe it i i high time for us to 
revise the old text book of national 
history and create a new one on the 
basis of everyone's experiences. 
However, can it merely be dedi-
cated to creation of hatred and dis-
trust? _ 

Here is my opinion. We should 
not justleam negative aspect of our 
history. There is something more 
imponant than remembering the 
number of minorities brutally killed 
by white .Ourhistoryclasses should 
encourage the understanding of how 
great people, regardles of race, tried 
to create a beller ociety through 
"self-help" and ideas. 

Kazuaki Uekawa 

Harris Responds to 
Regurgitated Rhetoric 
Editor: 

Again we encounter a pair of 
"band-wagoneers" who seek to cul-
tivate an arena of adulation at the 
expense of s unding, at best, me-
diocre. 

For future reference and present 
clarification, let it be well compre-
hended that the views expressed in 
my letters by no means reflect a 
collective attitude of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
(SAAC). 

It is my personal pleasure toedu-
cat.e those, who despite obvious 
reality, refuse to accept and exercise 
common sense. Now to dispense 
with the formality, let the teachings 
begin! 

Mr. Chen and Mr. Cohin.despite 
the fact that ignorance has reared its 
ugly head in the form oftwo anaUy-
retentive individuals, I shall only 
offer a bit of trict and precise en-
lightenment. 

When organizing a rebunal. one 
must first thoroughly research prior 
information in order to ecure and 
ubstantiatean argument. Surely one 

out of the two of you. could have 
" thought" before regurgitating 
rhetoric. 

In the April 18 i ue. (left hand 
column) Mr. Jonathan Traynham 
alluded to the fact that if the Guard-
ian were to "eliminate" Mr. 
Berman's articles. then he and prob-
ably the whole paper would be next. 
It is thi particular comment that I 
make reference to in my article. 

It only takes a little common 
en e to know not to speak before 

one thinks. I n't it feasible (using 
correct phraseology) "to remain si-
lent and be thought a fool than to 
speak and remove all doubt?" 

If members of the UCSD com-
munity were thinking so readily as 
Chen and Cohin suggest. then cul -
tural awareness would be reflected 
in the current curriculum. new pa-
pers. and the empty void between 
their ears. 

They demonstrate a lack of per-
ception and understanding by tat-
ing that SAAC wishes to obtain 
some form of credibility with the 
university's population. Unlike rec-
reational organizations. SAAC's 
objectives are much deeper. Fellas. 
familiarize yourselves with the con-
cept of substance. 

Acquiring knowledge of various 
cultures equips individuals with the 
powers of diversity . Mere credibil-
ity alone shall only foster shallow-
ness and instability. 

In conclusion, it is my advice 
thaI if one wishes to assen the inad-
equacies of another. one must first 
collect peninent and factual infor-
mation. 

Second, one must develop sup-
pon for these accusations to allevi-
ate the fear of being made to seem 
illiterate. Finally. one must not send 
children to do agrown-up'sjob! For 
further edification please contact "] 
need cultural lessons" at x46708 or 
attend SAAC meetings. every 
Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. 

P.S. Chen. aren ' t you an under-
represented student? Where are your 
priorities? I hope they are with your 
people! 

Vanness Harris 

This letter is in reference to the 
editorial"Manipulating the Media?" 
which appeared in the May 6 issue 
oftheGLIardian. The editorial stated: 
" It 's a hame that when he [Bard-
Alan Finlanj finally had ~omething 
important to tell the Guardian , he 
tried to silence it as soon a he had a 
tentative guaran tee of ' hush

before me. 

After about 20 phone calls from 
Stefan to myself and a friend of 
mine begging for mercy. 1 agreed to 
call the Guardian and request that it 
wait until the settlement meeting 
took place to get the details of the 
settlement before printing the story. 

This was a reasonable request. 
ince the man did offer to make 

good on the harm he had done by his 
negligence. Once his head was on 
the chopping block, and since he 
had requested mercy. it was my 
duty as a Christian to exercise a 
measure of grace toward him. ] did 
this according to his request, and I 
thought the Guardian understood.

• Karate makes 
the connection 
between mind 
and body 
By Debra Bronstein 
Staff Writer 

Some people think of karate 
just as a combination blows and 
grunts. But according to Mark 
Rosenberg. the director of the Li 
Center in Encinitas, karate is "a 
scientific way of learning to fight 
by utilizing the laws of physics to 
create the highest degree of power, 
[and by] using the least amount of 
physical exenion in order to con-
serve energy ... 

"Many schools are based solely 
on the physical teachings of ka-
rate, instead of focusing on the 
integration of mind and body," 
Rosenberg said. "There exists no 
division between mind and body. 
When you stretch the physical body 
to the limits , you are stretching 
mentally, too." 

According to Rosenberg, ka-
rate is an "eclectic art," as it d~vel ­
oped in several countries. The tra-
ditional form originated in China 
and India, where the Buddhist 
monks practised the arts of self-
defense to clear their minds and 
improve their concentration. In 
Okinawa, the natives developed a 
primitive system of manial arts. 
And the Koreans fused Okinawan 
Karate with Soo Bak Do to create 
Tang SooDo. 

Karate was once considered 
strictly an art of self-defense, but 
for Rosenberg. the physical aspects 
of self-defense are only a few of 
the lessons to be learned from the 
manial arts. 

]n 1922, Master Funakoshi in-
troduced karate as a "spon" to the 
universities in mainland Japan, said 
Steven UbI, a UCSD karate in-
structor. Funakoshi's son then 
founded the Japan Karate Associa-
tion, which later developed a school 
to train future martial arts instruc-
tors. 

These teachers, upon leaving 
Japan, spread the art -of Karate 
throughout the world. And accord-
ing to UbI, they got help from 
televsion. 

"I was watching a karate pro-
gram on PBS and I thought itlooked 
interesting. At that time, it was not 
widely practiced, and I enjoyed 
doing things that were not the fad ," 
Ubi said. 

Students are attracted to the 
kicks. punches. and dances, and 
want to experiment with them. For 
some karate s tudents , like John 
Gomez, karate began as just some-
thing to do. 

"Everybody tinkers with the 
idea of practicing karate, but few 
people actually start, and fewer 
stick with it," he said.

1945." they and 38 other UCSD students

" People must know that human beings 
are capable of such violence and cruelty. 
We need to educate everyone so that this 
ugly time in our history never repeats 
itself," said Fink. "We must learn to 
respect differences in people, not des tory 
them." 

"Aside from commemorating Anne 
Frank and all the victims of the Holocaust, 
we hope to educate as many people as 
possible about the causes and horror of 
racism of all kinds. After all, the Jews 
weren't the only victim of the Holocaust; 
there were also Gypsies, homo exuals, and

KARATE 
Conllnued from peg. 7 
ter, many students do not continue 
their study of karate for an ex-
tended period of time. 

Rosenberg explained that study-
ing the manial arts is a "confronta-
tional process," and this often 
frightens many newcomers. 

"Once students begin learning 
the technical aspects of karate, they 
start learning about themselves. 
They have very high ideals and 
standards, and sometimes wonder 
if their goals are realistically at-
tainable," Rosenberg said. 

While some stu-
dents don 't stick with 
karate, others who 
apply themselves 
and overcome 
their flaws realize 
that studying ka-
rate is a growth 
process. 

"Growth, in the 
sense of human poten-
tial, is not linear. We do not 
set a goal and then attain that goal 
with constant, undisturbed, steady 
forward progress. Instead we ad-
vance and retreat, repeatedly," 
Rosenberg said. 

The ultimate goal of karate, as 
stated in Grand Master Hwang 
Kee's Introduction to Moo Duk 
Kwan, is the "conditioning, coor-
dinating, and con troll ing" the mind 
and body. 

Inachieving this goal, there will 
be setbacks, " becau e it is from the 
setback that you learn," explained 
Ro enberg. 

Yet, by "watching our motives 
through exacting mental and physi-

cal activity, you become physi-
cally, mentally, and emotionally 
centered. The lazy become ex-
cited; the hyper, relaxed; and the 
weak, strong. Overall, you become 
more balanced," he said. 

Once one achieves this mind-
body equilibrium, the introspec-
tive lessons of karate become ap-
plicable to daily life. For Ubi, it 
has taught him "to be more in 
touch with myself. I've learned a 
new way oflife. Karate has taught 
me the art of patience. I ' ve learned 
how to control emotions." 

For Gomez, karate has "placed 
me more in control of 

myself and the 
situation. I have 
developed a 
greater i nti-
macy with 
my body and 
mind. 1 know 

my mental ca-
pacity and can 

overcome hurd-
les. 

"Sometimes when I 
have to present an oral argument 
and the pressure is on,l remember 
how to center myself. There is a 
place below the navel which in 
karate is considered the center of 
the body .lfI really concentrate on 
this place, and feel my whole body 
as balanced, I can get through the 
hostile situation and move on," he 
aid. 

"Studying the martial arts is an 
investment in the self that is not to 
be taken lightly," Rosenberg said. 
"The net wonh of my karate train-
ing is in the millions. I wouldn't 
change it for all the gold in the 
world."

FRANK: Exhibit rekindles horrors 
Continued from pege 7 
others," said Cindy Stalmaster, a 
UCSD junior assisting in 
coordinating the exhibit. "We 
must learn our lesson." 

Anne Frank died of typhus in 
1945, at the age of 16, while she 
was a prisoner in Bergen-Belsen 
concentration camp not far from 
Hanover, Germany. Prior to her 
capture, she and her family spent 
two years hiding from the Gestapo 
in occupied Amsterdam during 
World War D. Living in an anic 
over her father's warehouse, she 
documented the isolation of her 
days in what was to become one of 
the most famous diaries in litera-
ture. 

According to Stalmaster, Anne 
Frank's diary is not just a young 
girl's description of everyday life 
in hiding from the Nazis. Anne 
Frank's message to the world goes 
far beyond her dreams. Her inn0-
cence, awareness, and love of life 
have made it possible for millions 
of people around the world to un-
derstand and feel emotionally tied 
to the cruelty and injustice of the 
Holocaust. 

Cornelius Suijik, the interna-
tional director of the Anne Frank 
Foundation in Amsterdam, is re-
sponsible for taking the exhibit to 
Japan, Austria, Gennany, the 
United Kingdom, and the United 
States, where it will be viewed by 
millions of people. Since the tour 
began in the United States in 1985, 
the exhibit has traveled to 45 other 
North American cities and has been 
shown to nearly a million visitors.

docents, Suijik outlined their key 
teaching goals at the exhibit. 

"Convince the students that vic-
tims of discrimination'are not to be 
blamed. Convey that Hitler was 
elected and that most of the Ger-
man population supported him. 
Convince them that the Germans 
and the Austrians are not the only 
ones who are capable of discrimi-
nation and extreme racism," Suijik 
said. "Most importantly, encour-
age the students to look at each 
other as people, as individuals." 

ACCOrding to Grayson Covil, 
executive director of the American 
Friends of the Anne Frank Center, 
the educational message of the ex-
hibit is directed more toward a 
deeper understanding of how the 
Nazi state began rather than how it 
ended. And the juxtaposition of the 
Frank family history against the 
atrocities of the Holocaust gives 
the viewer an extraordinary per-
sonal insight into the Nazi reign of 
terror. 

In addition to UCSD students 
and members of the San Diego 
Community, 4,000 junior high and 
high school students are scheduled 
to tour the exhibit. The first groups 
oflhese students werecurtQ.us about 
the Holocaust, and anxious to find 
out what all the talk about "Anne 
Frank" is all about. 

"It's interesting to see the pic-
tures-they are what really hap-
pened," said Julio Loera, an eighth 
grader at Mark Twain Junior High 
School. 

After seeing the video, "Just A 
Diary," many students responded 
with surprise to the cruelty in the

"It's hard to believe - allthose 

dead bodies pushed into the pit. 
It's gross," said Beverly Gligo, an 
eighth grader at Mark Twain Jr. 
High. 

For some students, the exhibit 
was a realization that the Holo-
caust did not happen too long ago. 

"It's scary to think that all this 
happened so close to my lifetime. 
And to think that all these people 
believed Hitler. He must have been 
a brilliant guy ," said Nick Drobaclt, 
also an eighth grader at Mark 
Twain Jr. High. 

LeMY Lowndes, an eighth-
grade teacher at Mark Twain Jr. 
High explained that the presenta-
tion of Anne Frank's story is pow-
erful as a learning tool. 

"The large lighted displays of 
photos and text present the Holo-
caust in a simple and straight-for-
ward way which makes it easier 
for the students to understand. And 
the docents are great," he said. 

Following both the tour of the 
exhibit and the video presentation, 
the students were asked to add 
their personal messages about the 
Holocaust to a piece of paper. 

The responses included: "I 
thought that it was sick the way 
those people were killed and 
thrown in the hole"; "It should 
never happened again"; "I was very 
surprised that the Germans saw 
children and babies as a threat and 
thus needed to be exterminated", 
and "Let the future be different 
from the past. "

Continued from ptlge 8 
be a part of a paper chain dis-
played at the Children's Museum 
in La Jolla. 

Following the first tour of stu-
dents, Gershon Shafir, a professor 
of sociology at UCSD who was 
responsible for bringing the ex-
hibit and lecture series to San Di-
ego, was very happy with the do-
cents and the reactions from the 
anending students. 

"I knew the docents would be 
great and now I can finally see it," 
said Shafir. "While the docents 
are teaching the kids, they are also 
really learning forthemselves. It's 
a great combination." 

Shafir's personal experience 
with the Frank family makes this 
exhibit even more meaningful to 
him. Shafir's father and Otto 
Frank, Anne Frank's father, were 
both prisoners in the same con-
centration camp at Auschwitz. 
Their love of the German culture 
and their anempt to stay in high 
spirits regardless of their desper-
ate situation made them friends 
for life. 

"I hope the students take away 
the realization that it is easier than 
they think for a Holocaust to hap-
pen," said Shafir. "Our hope is to 
teach our kids, to make them re-
member the Holocaust and the 
demons that racism, of any kind, 
can bring." 

The Anne Frank exhibit, cre-
ated by the Anne Frank Center in 
Amsterdam, contains more than 
700 photographs and documents 
as well as the award-winning vid-
eotape, "Just a Diary." 

"Anne Frank is a symbol of 
where discrimination and preju-
dice can lead," Suijk said. "Now 
we have to fight to make sure that 
what she and her family went 
through will never happen again."

ARNETI 
Continued from page 1 

Arnett mentioned that when he arrived at 
the interview, his wallet and notebook were 
taken from him and he was trip-searched 
while officials went through hi clothes thor-
oughJy, including his shoes. Then Hussein's 
officiaJs required him to di infect hi hands. 

" I figured I had the high ground becuu I 
inlerviewed him far from the presidential 
palace, severa] mile from where he nonnally 
gave interviews," Arnett explained. 

'That had been bombed to the ground. It 
was in a private home in the northeast part of 
the city. He was essentiaJly on the run for fear 
of his life at that point.·' 

Arnett described Hussei n as 'a man of 
lirue resolve." 

According to Arnen, Hussein had threat-
ened La use chemical weapon and nuclear 
bomb ifnece ary, threats which never came 
to pass. 

Attheendofthe interview, Hussein' staff 
got anxious and wanted to keep the videotape 
overnight, but Arnett refused. 

" I was concerned that they may try to 
somehow doctor them," Arnett said, adding 
that the lraqis did let him leave the interview 
with the tape untouched. 

"It was a sobering experience," he said. 
When an audience member asked Arnett if 

the Iraq is were surprised at the ci vilian bomb-

ings, Amett replied that the people had not 
thought that they would be targeted, citing the 
limited number of civilian bombings during 
the Iran-Iraq war. 

"America was ponrayed up to Aug. 2 as 
basicaUyan ally. There is lots of American 
investment in Iraq," Arnett said. 

"[Baghdad] was a westernized capital. 
Baghdad i a relatively modem city by any 
standard, ce\1ainly by Mjdea t standards," 
he continued. 

He added that the allies used only' mart 
bombs' in Baghdad, limiting damage to mili-
tary installation and communication centers. 

" While there was some damage in 
Baghdad, the main damage was in cities out-
side Baghdad ," Arnell commented. "In 
Baghdad, the United States only used smart 
bombs." 

He had mentioned earlier that President 
George Bush had called CNN President Tom 
Johnson and spoke to him for half an hour, 
trying to convince him to pull the CNN crew 
fromlraq. The question was raised of what the 
consequences of having the American news 
team in Baghdad may have done to Pentagon 
strategy. 

"We don't really know the impact on 
strategy, having American reporters in 
Baghdad," Arnett said. 

In addi tion to his traveling and lectures, 
Arnett wilJ write a book before his return to 
CNN early next year.

increasingly tough road to hoe in

SOFTBALL 
Continued from page 16 

As for the Triton's opponents, 
UCSD has never played either 
Central (36-6) or Simpson (20-
11),soHeadCoachMelissaJarrell 
isn't quite ure what to expect: 
"We haven't seen them, so we're 
just going to have to go out there 
and play our game, make them 
play to u ." 

Jarrell can only hope that the 
right Triton team shows up on Fri-
day. Thus far, their season has been 
plagued with inconsistency. A per-
fect example was last week 's 
doubleheader against USD. The 
Tritons went out and beat up on the 
Toreros 7-1 in the fir t game. Then 
in the second game, against the 
same USD pitcher - Tiffany 
Wasilewki - UCSD was the team 
getting beat up 9-1. "We were a 
completely di fferent team that sec-
ond game. I just kept thinking, 
when's this nightmare going to 
end?" Jarrell said after the game. 

If they are to have any hope of 
advancing, the Tritons ' success will 
hinge on their aggressiveness at 
the plate. Led by UCSD's all-time 
baning leader Dana Chaiken, cur-
rently hitting at a .352 pace, the 
Tritons are going to have to score 
a lot of runs early and hope that 
their defense can stay error-free 

KINGS

way. rtwas aperformanceall Kings 
fans are proud of. 

Now, about us fans , we love 
winnersju t like anybody else, and 
we're glad the Kings are winning 
after all the e years. But if I'm not 
mistaken, the A's were awful in 
the late '70s and early '80s. Phil, 
did you go to A's games when 
Matt Keough and Rick Langford 
were the staff aces, and Jack 
McKeon was the manager? Did 
you see the 4gers in 1979 when 
they were 2- 14? 

Think about it. Kings fans are 
no different from Bay Area fans 
and others who suffered for so 
long but who are now tasting vic-
tory. 

I must admit, however, I'm a 
relatively new Kings fan. [ started 
following them in October. You 
see, I had no access to the televi-

SPORTS 11 

Brian Morris/Guardian 
Catcher Cindi Murphy will call the signals for one of the strongest 
pitching staffs the Tritons have carried into the postseason. 
and hold on to the lead. 

Besides Chaiken, who also has 
24 stolen bases and 15RBIs, UCSD 
will depend on Kathy Fogg, who is 
hitting .3 13 with 15 RBIs . 

Defensively, the Tritons boast 
one of the deepest pitching staffs 
they have ever brought to regionaJs. 
Anchoring the staff is Dianna 
Moreno, a second-team A \1-
American last year who ports the 
lowest career ERA in UCSD his-
tory. The second pitcher is Fogg 
(8-9), who leads the team in 
strikeouts with 42. Backing them 

sion games until my house got 
hooked up to Prime Ticket and 
Sport Channel in August, 1990. 
Now I'm hooked on hockey and 
the Kings. and I'm in this for the 
long haul. 

Hockey i a great sport. It 's 
fast, furious, intense, and fun to 
watch, e pecially guys like Mario 
Lemieux. Brett Hull , and Steve 
Yzennan. You may not feel the 
same way about hockey, but once 
the San Jose Sharks start winning, 
you 'Ujumpon the bandwagon very 
fast, and you' lI start wearing $1 ()() 
jer eys (i nCidentally, you can get 
tho e for $50). I wear my Luc 
Robitaille jersey with pride, and 
I' ll even wearit on 90-degree days. 

So before you throw stones at 
Kings fans, take a look at your own 
backyard. The OakJand A's played 
with no conviction and heart in last 
year's World Series. Heck, they 
were awful. As for Rickey 
Henderson and Jose Canseco, they 

up are Kim Stutzman and Lacie 
Mounger, both of whom are 2-2. 

The Tritons are 10-2 this year 
against Division III competition, 
however none of those teams are in 
the tournament thi year. For Jarrell, 
in her first year, "The pressure of 
actually getting in is over. Now we 
can senle down (md play each game 
without worrying about our next 
one." 

Despite the stress, come next 
weekend and the national champi-
onship, the Tritons would love to 
be worrying about their next game. 

show arrogance and aloofness that 
is unhealthy for baseball. Wayne 
Gretzky, however, exemplifies 
teamwork and unselfishness. He is 
a true role model for many, and he 
conducts him elf with grace and 
humility. 

I'd rath er have guys like 
Gretzky, Tony Gwynn, and Nolan 
Ryan on my sidc than a Cansecoor 
a Henderson. 

Phil, I don't expect to change 
your mind about the Kings, their 
fans, and hockey for that matter, 
but consider this: You Bay Area 
fans make me laugh. Southern 
Califomia is probably the best place 
in the U.S. for spectatorsports. San 
Diego and Los Angeles have a lot 
to offer, and the King are further 
proof of that assessment. There-
fore, I believe your column was 
written in envy over Southern Cali-
fornia sports. Long live the Kings 
(and Padres, too)!

lrnERS / THE OTHER PERSPECTI\ E 

Kings' Fans Take 
Exception to Gruen 
Editor: 

Phil Gruen: Speaking of wind 
and thing blowing (The KillgsAre 
Dead - Good Riddance , GLlard-
ian, May 2, 1991 ) ... you certainly 
do a lot of talking. And talking. 
Give it a f- ing re t! You obvi-
ously know nothing about hockey 
nor can you appreciate a phenom-
enal team. 

I happen to be a "die-hard Kings 
fan," always wa . If you don ' t be-
lieve me, let me prove it to you . 
Wait! ... Why do I have to prove 
anything to you? You 're carcely 
wonh re ponding to and I was go-
i ng to laugh it off like all of your 
other lame commentarie - and ter-
rible record on predictions. How-
ever, I felt at one point after un-
fairly criticizi ng the newer Kings 
fans, that you were speaking to me 
directly. I wearmy"black umber-
some Kings' jersey" around cam-
pus <lnd wherever I go because I'm 
proud that they've improved so 
much and are finally getting the 
recognition they deserve. If you 
want to come up to me and laugh at 
me, do so at your own ri sk . 

me fa Is: For the firSltilllc in 
their 24-year hi~t ry (yes , Ihal is 
twenty-four) they have won their 
divi sion. This wa no ea y kat. 
The Smylhe Division is the t ugh-
est in the IlL. Thl!Y have domi-
nated pos ession of the Stanley 
Cup for the past decade . 

You want totalk about improve-
ment. .. the King " defen e has 
shaved over 80 goals againstlhem 
fr m Ihclr previolls seas n. Last 
year, they kn ked off the defend-
ing cup champions to advnnce to 
the second round. Thi year, the 
sports writers predi ted they would 
come in fourth in their division. I 
guess they . h wed them. They 
came in third overall in the HL 
behind Chicago and St. Louis. But 
then, I gucss you already knew 
that, Mr. Hocke . 

Where wa I before Gretzky 
came 10 town? I was in L. . at Ihe 
Forum cheering on L.A. 's fi rst pro-

fe~~ional hockey leam. How the 

hell did you expect to ee me and 
other fan in the early 19 0 , un-
less you were in L.A.? In ca e you 
didn ' t realize , the King are an 
L.A . team. 

Marty Weingarten 

P.S. If you ever want to talk 
hockey or any other port [about) 
which you know nothing, call me 
and [ will tea h you. 

P.P.S. I don't think you have 
the ball to print this. 

Editor: 
I understand Phil Gruen doc n't 

care for the King or Iheir fans . [ 
gue s he con ider the King over-
paid fool and ch ker , and a for 
thefan ,hecon idersu fair-wcuth-
ered, crazy fool . Well, Phil , I've 
heard other ay the same thing 
about the Oakland A ·s. That 's right, 
your beloved A's, the nes you 
wept for when the Reds swept them 
in October. That'sokay, I was very 
upset when the Oilers beat the 
Kings again. but r am very happy 
with their efforts thi pa~t ~ea~o n. 

You see, Phil, what you failed 
to consider was thai Ihe Kings 
played with coumge, conviclion, 
and a lot of heart. The did nOI fold 
up their tents as they did in 19 9 
and 1990 against algary and 
Edmonton, rc pectively. Even with 
inj uri es to G retzky, Toma 

andstrom, Bob Kudel ki. and 
tev Kasper, they s tayed with the 

Oilers and fought damn hard. Even 
veterans like John Tonelli . Dave 
Taylor. and Larry Robinson look 
up a lot of the action, and of cour e 
goalie Kelly Hrudey was e cep-
tionally super in the nets. He was 
the main reason the Kings stayed 
in the eries. And you can ' t dis-
count the heart of Gretzky and 
Sand trom. Gretzky had 25 stitches 
in hi - left ear, and Sandstrom played 
with a fracture in hi s TIght knee. In 
the end, it was (he Oiler playoff 
experience that won it, but the 
King proved themse lvc in a big

THOMAS 
Continued from page 16 
a book by its cover, and the senior 
captain of the UCSD golf team i a 
case in point. In fact, Thomas ' 
difference from the tereotypical 
college golfer are about a numer-
ous as the number of trokes it 
takes to get around Torrey Pines' 
difficult South eour e. 

The Long Trek to San Diego 
Unlike 0 many top collegiate 

golfer , who learned to swing a 
golf club before they could walk, 
Thoma ' love for the game is a 
relatively new-found one. Hedidn ' t 
have the lUXUry of growing up in a 
family where his parents could act 
as teaching-pros-in-residence. In 
fact, he and hi father picked upthe 
game at about the ame time. 

"My dad tarted playing golf 
pretty late in life and he liked it so 
much that he encouraged me to 
come out and play with him," Tho-
ma aid. "] didn ' t even start play-
ing golf until I wa in high school 
and didn't play for [my high chool] 
team until the tenth grade." 

Thoma al 0 grew up in an area 
- Salt Lake City, Utah - that 
i n't exactly known as an a em-
bly line that spits out one high-
powered golfer after the other. 
"You can only play about seven 
month ' out of the year there, and 
the cour es just aren't the same 
as you find out here," Thomas 
noted. 

Despi te all f the e apparent 
handicap .Thoma wentontohave 
a very succe ful high chool ca-
reer, placing second in his region 
and fifth in the s tate in hi senior 
year. With thi s kindoftrack record , 
one might have expe led Thomas 
to have blazed a trail to the neare t 
Division I golf program, but he

ended up at academics-oriented 
Divi ion III UCSD instead. 

But a we've already learned, 
you can't take Devin Thomas for 
granted. In fact, with a little inves-
tigation, it becomes clear that 
UCSD was a perfect fit for Tho-
mas. " My mother lived out here [in 
La Me a] and my brother was a 
graduate student in chemistry ," he 
aid. "1 also wanted to go some-

where where you play all year long. 
San Diego was perfect for that. " 

Making a Name in Division III 
Thoma ' prep succe s didn ' t 

immediately translate it elf to the 
college level, a he just mi sed 
making the team's "top five" in his 
freshman year and redshirted his 
second year due to ome academic 
difficulties. 

But after that early adver ity, 
Thoma has come on strong to be 
UCSD' number-one man forthree 
years running. He credi ts much of 
his improvement to UCSD Head 
Coach Mike Wydra , who helped to 
completely change Thomas ' grip, 
stance , and wing during his fre h-
man year. "Mike is a great teach-
ing coach," Thomas observed. 

Stanforth said. "Relatively peak-
ing, we're stronger in the field than 
on the track. The conference is 
stronger in the field," 

UCS D ' Scott Sargeant is 
ranked number one in both the 
hammer and the discus. Other 
ranked men include Paul' Cogbill 
in the hammer and discus, J.J ..

"My first year here, Mike vid-
eotaped us all at a practice and then 
showed them to u . That was the 
first time I'd ever een my swing 
and it made a big difference to-
ward changing it for the better." 

Although Thomas' game has 
improved by leaps and bounds, he 
still has a tendency to get infuri-
ated on the cour e, leading to 
double-digit scoring on single 
holes. ''I've been known to break a 
few clubs in my day and get angry 
out on the course ," he aid. " My 
teammates have nicknamed me 
'squawk' because I'm very vocal 
when I mis a close putt or make a 
bad hot." 

Perhaps the most notable of 
these blow-ups happened two years 
ago in the final roundofthe NCAA 
Divi ion OJ national tournament 
where he carded an II -over-par 15 
on the 11th hole, soaring to 93 on 
the day . " He has such high expec-
tation forhim elf that he gets very 
disppointed and angry when he 
makes a mi take," Wydra said. 
" But he's much more composed 
out on the course than he used to 
be. He 's improved by leaps and 
bounds. " 

After College, What's Next? 
Thomas' long-term goal is to 

make a li ving playi ng professional 
golf. ''I'm going to tum pro right 
after national are finished," he 
said. "In coll ege, all you do is play 
to win," he aid. "If you come in 
econd, no one remembers if yo u 

played well or not, just that yo u 
lost. ft 's totally different [playing] 
pro. If you come in second, you

is second in the high jump, Bobbie 
Octavo is in the top three in the 
javelin, and Debbie Hargrove and 
Diane Fritz are ranked in the dis-
cus and long jump, respectively . 

The sole Triton on the track to 
rank in the top six is Alan Mead-
ows in the 110 and 400 meter 
hurdles. 

" We'll have rrouble on the track, 
both men and women," Stanforth 
said. 

"[But] we'll hold our own in the 
field."

o kidding. They finished the 

sea on 15-23. Wor e, it wasn't a 
hopele 15-23. Mixed in with the 
frequent 10 e were \ in over San 
Diego State (ranked 20th in Divi -
sion l) and USD. 

That meant that they were af-
flicted with the worst malady in 
sports - potential. Clint Hurdle 
had potential. 

"I've been accustomed to win-
ning. I'm the worst 10 er in the 
count ry," Yates said . .. It wears on 
you after awhile." 

For Yate , the nightmare sea-
on started before the Tritons had a 

chance to break from the gate. 
There they were, lining up like a 
thoroughbred at the Kentucky 
Derby, when all four of their legs 
broke at once. 

CRACK! Craig Gill, a transfer 
from Saddle back Junior College 
whom Yates had expected to take 
over at third base, had rotator cuff 
surgery, and was out for the year. 

CRACK! Catcher Anthony 
Sanchez injured his knee in the 
fall. For the rest of year, he had to 
wear a clunky leg brace. "He had a 
fine year, but it could have been 
better ifhe had been healthy," Yates 
said. 

Remarkably, Sanchez played in 
every game. But , really, he had 
little choice in the matter. That's 
because his backup - Dominic 
Dirksen, who hit .389 in the fall-
missed the entire season after hav-
ing surgery in January. 

CRACK ! Shortstop Steve 
Nowlan went out with an injured 
knee. He came back, but his knee

urprise. We thought going in that 
we were going to hit the ball, and 
we were going to catch it. But what 
ended up savi ng us was our pitch-
ing s taff. ,. Yates said. 

"I give full credit to the pitching 
coaches, Tom arlier and Max 
Kandler." 

nd the Tritons did go 10-8 
agai n ·t Division 1lI opponents. 
That's good enough for ~ome 
schools, but not for Yates. at 
when you've gotten in the habit of 
accepting bids to post eas n tour-
namenls in January. "Mosl people 
would have been happy with 10-8 
in [their] own division . But we 
weren'(." 

If anything, the debac le of 1991 
has Yates anticipating next year 
more than ever: ''I'm convinced 
that we run a quality program. It 
was just one of those years where 
nothing seemed to go right." 

Brian Morris/Guardian 
Anthony Sanchez (right) played the entire season with a brace on his knee. He was one of several 
Tritons felled by injuries in 1991, as UCSD slumped to 15-23 after five straight winning seasons. 

In fact. he' already thinking 
ahead. He's considering moving 
the left-fie ld fence in 10 feet from 
330 feet to 320 feet, in part to 
counteract the winds that blow in 
from left. 'The wind negate the 
power from the right ide," Yates 
said . bothered him all year, and he wa 

limited to de ignated hitter. "He 
might have been our best ball player 
ifhe had been healthy," Yates said. 

CRACK! Rightfielder Joe 
DeFranco injured his knee skiing 
in December, and wasn't the same 
the rest of the year. "He hit less 
than half of what he should have 
hit," Yates said. 

The horse was flopping around 
on its belly, and the bell hadn't 
even rung. And you know what 
they do to a horse with a broken 
leg. They shoot 'em. 

"When you start to 10 e a few 
games, for a while [began to think 
that we just forgot how to coach," 
Yates said. "And maybe the play-
ers thought that they forgot how to 
play ." 

The injuries caused all sorts of 
problems. First, the defense went 
downhill. " What we thought might 
be the left side of our de fen e was 
suddenly gone," Yate said. "Our 
defense ended up being one of the 
worst defenses we've had at this 
school." 

Then the offense went south . 

"We didn't have a lot of people 
who could change the complexion 
of the game," Yates said. 

According to Yates, the turning 
point this year was a doubleheader 
in which UCSD was swept by The 
Master's: "We had no punch. That, 
for me, was an indication that we 
were going to struggle this year." 

Still. all was not lost. As 
Murphy's Law would have it, the 
only thing that surpa sed expecta-
tions was the Triton ' biggestques-
tion mark at the start of the year. 

"Our pitching staff was a big 

Andhe' gothiseyeonacouple 
of junior college pitchers whom he 
believes can add depth and experi-
ence to what hould be a sol id 
pitching staff for next year. 

"I take losing personally, and I 
think some of our players do as 
well. I'm anxious to get our pro-

Paving the 
Road to Iowa 
• Preview: Softball opens up the 
pOstseason against Simpson (IA) 
By Gregg Wrenn 

UCSD softball team heads into the first 
round of the NCAA champion hip at Pella, 
Iowa, this weekend, however, the only thing 

the Tritons are thinking about is ha.rve ting enough wins 
to send them into the next round' . 

The Tritons, seeded second in the three-team We t 
Regional , kick off the postseason tomorrow by taking on 
third-seeded Simpson (lA). The regional tournaments 
are double-elimination, so top-seeded Central (IA) will 
play the loser of the UCSD-Simpson game and then the 
winner of game one on Friday. 

Stephanie Molina and the Tritons are looking for sound defense and 
aggressiveness at the plate in this weekend's West Regional in Iowa. . 

The possibilities arising from what happens on Friday 
and how it relates to Saturday'S title game are almost as 
complicated as trying to figure out the Stanley Cup 
playoffs.

THE SEASON OF illS 

DI ENT 
For Lyle Yates, 1991 was the most frustrating year of his career. 
By Peter Ko 
Sports Editor 

W HEN LYLE YATES came to UCSD, there were, in hi s estimation, at most three players who should 
have been playing college ba eball. 

" Our worst year wa in 1983. That was 
my second year here. We were expected to 
lose," said the UCSD baseball head coach. 
But Yates weathered that torm - a eason 
which saw the Triton fini h ami erable 11 -
30 - and then tarted to tum the program 
around. What fo llowed were five consecu-
tive winning ea on ,a fifth -place fini h at 

the 1987 NCAA Division ill World Series, 
and a 100-52 record against Division ill 
opponents . 

The grass was definitely getting greener. 
In fact, it was raging out of control. Yates was 
sailing along so well that he even had time to 
plant some grass of his own in 1990. For the 
ne w Triton Stadium that is. 

And then came this year. Someone poured 
ga on the gras . 

"Thi was definitely our most frustrating 
year," Yates said. ':Since (1983), this has 
definitely been our worst year."

Everything about Devin Thomas says golf. 
He has that clean-cut, All-American look 

L'lat suggests someone who has grown up around 
golf arid is probably more at home on the greens

He 's got that picture-book golf swing that is 
usually a dead gi veaway of years of experience 
and hundreds of hours under the watchful eye of 
high-priced professional instructors. 

If you weren't careful, you might mistake 
Devin Thomas for a memberofthe latest crop of 
young pros who have come straight out of high-
powered, Division I golf programs to make 
thousands of dollars per year on the PGA Tour.

New Music Festival 

By Alexa Sherman 
Staff Writer 

Meet Social Distortion - a band filled with contradic-
tions. Composed of singer-guitarist Mike Ness, drummer 
Christopher Reece, bas ist John Maurer, and rhythm guitar-
ist Dennis Danell , the band emerged from L.A. 's late- '70s 
punk scene (the curren t lineup has remained ince 1983). 
Their music now, though maintaining some of its raw punk 
style, has become decidedly more polished and marketable. 
Although they have been making music for about 10 years, 
they are dubbed a " new" band on the bi ll at the New Mus ic 

Festival thi s weekend. They have an anti -establishmen t 
image, yet they work in a commercial, capitali s t industry. In 
a recent te lephone conversation, Dancll attcmpted to c larify 
and explain what the band is all abo ut. 

Social Distortion' self-titled album, the first on a major 
label , was re leased la t year. Lyrically . the music on Social 
Distortion goe much deeper than that of most of the emp'ty-
headed, early punk bands of the late '70s and early '80s. In thi s 
sense, Social Distortion takes a new approach to an old style.

What started off as a small Sftllla Barbara band, 
Toad the Wet Sprocket is now making a play for 
the masses with its third album. "Fear." due out 
July 16. The band is also co-headlining the New 
Music Festival th is Saturday with Social Distor-
tion. 

Toad the Wet Sprocket began when all four 
members. Todd Nichol (guitars), Glen Phillips 
( lead vocals), Dean Dinning (bass, piano), and 
Randy Guss (percussion) met while performing a 
p lay in high school. Nichol and Phillips decided to 
jam, and when Nichol brought Dinning and Guss 
into the picture, everyth ing fell into place. 

Phillips came up with the name of the band. but 
no one thought it would s tick. "We're not quite 
sure what it mean ," said Nichol in a recent inter-
view. "The name comes from an old Momy 
Python record. I'm not the Python fan, but Glen 
can do the whole rout ine. We never thought the 
name would last, but once we played some shows, 
we decided to keep it. " 

The beginning was a s truggle, and Toad wa 
literally playi ng for peanuts. "At first, we started 
playing at this Sama Barbara club, the Shack. They 
used to pay their bands with beer, but si nce we 
were under age, we got payed with nuts. And the 
owner didn ' t pay his ASCAP fee, so we were 
forced to do o riginal , which was a good thing." 

Toad produced and recorded the firs t album,

Exploring the Ambiguity in Art 
+[THE] offers an eclectic evening of music and theater 
By Christina Huizar 
Arts/Entertainment Editor 

Critics have aid that they ' re, 
"as zany as Monty Python, a ur-
real a the receiving room at Belle-
vue - the ab urdity of life neatly 
s kewed," in addi tion to, " like 
Cheech and Chong playing Dr. 
Strangelove." The same ambigu-
ity that surrounds the dou's name 
can al 0 be found in their perfor-
mances. 

[THE] will explore the ambigu-
iryoflife's 

convent ions in the manner of mu-
sic, movement, satire, and humor 
on Saturday nig ht in Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

[THE] is a charismatic com-
poser-perfonner team comprised 
of trumpeter Edwin Harkins and 
baritone Philip Larson. Larson and 
Harkins, both music professors, 
met several years ago through a 
mutual friend at a golf course. Sev-
eral holes into the game, the two 
realized they were both heading 
out to the West Coast to study at 
the same institution - the Univer-
s ity of California at San Diego. 

A s Rocke-feller 
Fellows, the two 

worked at the 
Center for Mu-

sic Experiment 
and partici-
pated in the 
Ex tend ed 
Vocal Tech-
niques En-

semble, com-
prised of two 
men and two 
women. It was 
here that they 
noticed tha t 
they had the 
same pecu-
liartenden-
cies of re-
action s 
and move-
ment s. 
Shortly 
thereafter, 
they de-
cided to try 
perfonning 
on their 
own, where 
they would 
be able to 
focus more 
on the theat-
rical aspects 
of music per-

fonnance. 
By 1978 , 

they had made 
the decision to 
commit them-

elve to put on an entire program 
of [THE] material. Their work 
took off and landed them perfor-
mances in Japan, Canada, Holland, 
and Europe. Baek in the United 
States, [THE] collaborated with 
John Cage and Tora Takemitsu in 
a performance of the Pacific Ring 
Fe tival in '86. 

[THE] grew, and put on large 
staged productions which used 
many props and equipment. "We 
had it with the huge productions. 
There were so many worries to 
think of, just too much baggage 
which in effect re tricted us," ex-
plains Harkins of their decision to 
make the switch to low-tech pro-
ductions . 

The switch from hi gh-tech to 
low-tech altered other aspects of 
their performances. "Prior, we ap-
proached the hows a musicians. 
We didn't ever peak . By '89 we 
were speaking," explains Harkins . 
Speaking in a [THE] perfonnance 
is not to be confused with normal, 
tangible dialogue mo t would ex-
pect. "Noi es" is a more appropri-
ate definition tode cribe what they 
do. 

Harkins and Larson are very 
interested in the am biguity they 
provide, not only in their banners 
plastered around campus, but also 
in their photos and perfonnances. 
" It is adesired response we enjoy," 
says Larson. " It is an image that 
makes you think and wonder," adds 
Harkins. 

It is very important they never 
tel too much. The element of s ur-
prise is very important to maintain 
so that their performances will be 
honest to the audience. 

Along with the ambiguity, 
[THE] throws in abstraction. 
" What is produced is abstract. 
Fences. Borderlines. Meanings that 
walk along this line. Confusion 
that e nters in and you are not sure 
where," explains Harkins.

The Greatest Show on Earth ... 
Andy Clarke 
Staff Writer 

Here' s something to make us 
aU feel inadequate . At the age when 
most American were entering 
graduate c hool, de perately fore-
tailing the inevitable en try into 

"real life, " Orson Welles managed 
to create a masterpiece of cinema. 
At the age of26. while most of his 
contemporaries were writing their 
pieces of academic work, Welles 
directed, produced, co-wrote, and 
played the title role in "Ci ti zen 
Kane." 

In the past few years, cinema 
audiences have been witness to an 
increasing number of re-released 
c lassics . The "newly-restored" 
"Gone With the Wind" and 
"Lawrence of Arabia" have both 
resurfaced. 

So far in 1991. the new 
"Spanacu "ha opened (complete 
with the restored , raunchy bath 
scene) and now "Citizen Kane" is 
back. No previously-unseen foot-
age, just a newly struck 35mm 
negative in honor of the film's 
50th anniversary. 

This is nor a good assignment 
for a critic. How do you justifiably 
criticize a film that has been voted 
"Best Film of All Time" in four 
succes ive " SightandSound"polls 
of international film cri tics. And 
there is no indication that it wi ll 
give up its position in the future 
either. Nothing in cinema from the 
1980s really deserve to replace it, 
especially as "Kane"'s critical 
reputation continues to grow. 

In addition, "Citize n Kane"'s 

re-release re-awaken everal mys-
teries that are still unresol ved. How 
did Or on Welle ,a fir t-time film 
director, create one of the greatest 
motion picture of all time? Why 
did RKO, a studio on the verge of 
financial disaster, give carte 
blanche to a man with no filmmak-
ing experience? And con idering 
the film's almost biographical por-
trayal of William Randolph Hearst, 
how could Welles and co- writer 
Hennan J. Mankiewicz find the 
courage to take on one of the 
mightie t hapers of public opin-
ion in American hi tory? 

The fictional Charle Foster 
Kane, played by Orson Welles, 
was modeled so closely after the 
real Hearst that he became deter-
mined to undennine the film . 

At the t ime of Kane's death, 
where the movie begins, K ane is 
an isolated and failed bu iness 
magnate, thwaned in love a well 
as life. A "March of Time"-like 
newsreel investi gates his life, 
which revolved around a newspa-
per empire. 

In a en e. the new reel is " Citi-
zen Kane" in miniature . We learn 
that Kane was an enormously con-
troversial character, admired and 
loathed by millions of Americans. 
His incalculable wealth wa inher-
ited by fluke, and the influence he 
would come to wield at the turn of 
the century was enormous. The 
collapse of his political ambition 
and his marriages are chronic led, 
revealing how the Depress ion 
crippled his media empire and led 

to his self-imposed exile to his 
palatial residence of Xanadu. 
Watch for the u eofBalboaPark's 
architecture in the sequence of clips 
during Orson Welles' vinual copy 
of the Hearst Ca tie . 

"Gone with the Wind" seemed 
to demonstrate that cinematic 
Showmans hip co uld reach no 
higher level, bu t "Citizen Kane" 
proved that pa t limits and prece-
dent in cinema were no longer 
applicable. Here was a film that 
u ed every device to perfection. 
and had a narrative that flowed 
poetically from image to image, as 
if emulating a person's stream-of-
consciousne s. A man who was all 
things to all people req uired a real 
stretch of the film's capibilities to 
convey his story. 

Filmic language is at the fore-
fro nt of "Kane. " " You don ' t know 
what can 't be done." said camera-
man Gregg Toland when he of-
fered his kills to Welles. Improve-
ments in fi lm stock, li ght sources, 
and camera allowed Toland to 
achieve almost "universal" focus 
within the film' s frames. 

Thu , in a single shot. Welles 
was ab le to communicate a huge 
amount of narrative material while 
in troducing the intricate relation-
ship of the characters. both to the 
setting and to one another. At this 
point, when Kane's Xanadu , or the 
newsroom of "The Inquirer," are 
hown, the cei lings are brought to 

the viewer's attention. Their pres-
ence is made all but essential by 
Toland 's deep-focus composition. 

HIATUS 3 

Orson Welles stars in the film classic, ·Citizen Cane " at the Ken. 

In addition. throughout the 
movie, selective lighting, silhou-
etted figures. and Ooor-Ievel cam-
era ang les abound. 

Flashbacks as a ci nematic de-
vice came of age with this movie's 
release in 1941. as did the use of

Such scenes al 0 demonstrate 
o o n Welles ' virtuosity with the 
oundtrack of the film . His experi -

ence in radio, including his notori-
ous production of " War of the 
Wo rld " in 1938, se rved him well. 
Sho t were rapidly joined, not by 
the logic of thei r images (as be-
fo re) but by the continuity of the 
soundtrack. Dialogue was bril-
liantly overl apped, res ult ing in a 
new level of realis tic, on- creen 
conver ation'. 

"Citizen Kanc" appeared t 
have everything going for it. ot 
only was it innovative, but its nine 

Oscar nominations (including Best 
Film, Best Actor, Best Director, 
Best Cinematogrdphy, and Be t 
Original Screenplay) seemed to 
guarantee the film a huge commer-
c ial future. 

But that 's no t what happened. 
The film only won one Academy 
Award (for Best Original Screen-
play- the only compet itive Oscar 
Welles would ever win), and a 
systematic campaign by a jealous 
Hollywood and Willi am Randolph 
Hearst led to the fi lm ' antagonis-

economy of the budget (the mov ie 
cost a mere $686,033 to make), 
"Citizen Kane " los t almost 
$150,000. Stuck in the vaults until 
1956, the movie was eventually 
" rediscovered" by a group of Eu-
ropean cri tics. Their cri tical raves 
eventually began to be felt around 
the world. 

Yet i the film truly perfect? 
Certai nly, it does have several fun-
damental fault . The lack of hard 
information about Kane's charac-
ter make the man one o f the great 
mysteries in the history of film . 

The scant mentio n o f hi s 
mothe r and the huge, igno red ec-
tion of h is biog raph y a re 
unsatisfying. 

Greatest of all quibbles, though, 
is the con equen t innbility of the 

audience to be able to truly iden-
tify with the character of Charles 
Fo ter Kane. 

In a 1963 inte rv iew, Or on 
Welles h imsel f desc ribed the 
" Rosebud" motif as "a gimmick 
really. and ra ther dollar-dook 
Freud. "It becomes glaringly obvi-
ou , however, in a film that is 
consumate ly brilliant ineveryother 
area. 

When it was re leased, "Citizen 
Kane" wa radically experimen-
tal , anticipating as it did the deve l-
opment of wide- c reen photogra-
phy and tereo ound. What the 
film did was to move cinema into 
the modernism al ready pre ent in 
the other arts. 

To call a fil m "The Greate t" 
neces aril y means that you have

"Cit izen Kane" presented an un-
paralleled advance in the hi story 
of narrative fil m. 

Even Ted Turner, who owns 
the rights, realized he couldn't 
touc h it , much les re lea e a 
colorized version. 

In the opening few minutes of 
the f i lm ' new s re el footage, 
Charles Fo ter Kane is described 
as "a potent fi gure of our century ." 
The arne might be said in cin-
ematic tenn for "C iti zen Kane. " It 
is an achievement that might never 
be matched.

The UCSD Guardian 

SOCIAL 
Continued from H1 
Ne s' autobiographical reflections on his early life as 
a drunk, fighting, drug-abu ing, rebell ious kid who 
has now learned from expe rience. 

Nes abandoned his turbulent ex istence over fi ve 
years ago. Danell said , "lthink that 010 I of Mike's 
lyrics are omething that he" been thro ugh_ That's 
where a lot of his personality and depth omes from, 
because it does have a lot of personal feeling in-
vo lved:' 

While Social Distort ion was once angry and rebel-
lious, in the true piri t of punk, it now look back on the 
past as a dis tant memory. Ness sang, "Oh, I' m Prison 
Bo und/ I did a crime one too many times .. ./ Oh, I'm 
Pri on Bound/ I may never know any othe r way." 

Now, on the commercially succe 'sful ong "Ball 
and Chain," Nes - sings , "Well it 's been 10 years and 
a thousand tears/And look at the mess I'm in/A broken 
nose and a broken heart/An empty bOllle of gin." Ness 
goes on to plead in the ong to take away the " ball and 
chain" created by his rebelliousness. 

Danell commented on the lyrical t:volution of the 
band, saying, " When we were teenagers, it was easy to 
write songs about rebe lling aga inst the cops and mom 
and dad , and aying how everything suck and you 
ha te everything. But as you grow older. you fi nd ways 
to make th ing more omfortab le, and there's other 
aspect of life to ta lk about now." 

Addressing the posi tive effects that the recent al-
bum has had on thei r audience, Danell said , " I think 
people u ed to think Mike was really cool when he wa 
all strung out and hav ing problem , but now they've 
seen him tum himself around, and I guess that inspires 
them todo the same thing. and they reaJl y think it 's all 
right to have your hit together." 

Yet the band tries to steer clear of preaching to its 
audience. Dane ll said, " I 'm not out here tryi ng to save 
the world , but if I can help, [ will. We 're j ust mu i-
cians. We try to set good example for people, e pe-
cial ly when the re are the e young kids that are into it. " 

Listening to Social Distortion, the band has obvi-
ously stagnated in it punk sound , despite the lyrical 
evolution. On Social Distortion, there i not a tremen-
dous amount of diversity in sound from one song to the 
nex t. 

Yet Danell insisted that they are moving away from 
their punk influences, claiming, " Maybe a lot of '70s 
punk really influenced us in the early years, but now I 
thi nk our root are coming ouI. We can experiment a 
little bit more , with all of the post-punk stuff that 's 
been going on. We have time 10 explo re different 
avenues a little bit deeper." 

Although there i a hint of departure from punk on 
Social Distortion's more bluesy ongs, " Drug Train " 
and "It Coulda Been Me," perhaps a truly different 
sound wi ll emerge on the band 's future albums. For 
now, they have subscribed to the commerc ially suc-
cessful fo nnula of one uniform sound. 

Danell even speculated that if he were to do a solo 
project separate from Social Distortion, "l ohn [Maurer] 
and I would do something totally on the other spec-
tru m from Social D. We'd probably go intoa lot more 
synthesized drum-machine type tuff. That 's what 

TOAD 
Continued from H1 
Bread and Circus on its own label, Abe' s, for a mere 
$650. 

T heir first effort wa originally avni lable only in 
Santa Barbara, but word of mouth promoted Toad , 
and record labels began furiously competing for a 
contract with the band. Columbia Records won, but 
Bread and Circus was not remixed or cleaned up at all . 

Toad's populari ty grew through coll ege radio, but 
Nichol doesn ' t want the band' s music to be consid-
ered alternative or any other genre. "It aggravates me 
tha t everything has a classification. Our music is just 
tha t - music. We're not altemati ve, and with our new 
album, Fear, we are more accessible. We appeal 10 
both college and normal people and everyone in 
between," Nichols aid. 

T oad has been described as a c ross between Jack-
son Browne and the Smiths, but this does not begin to 
capture the band' s true sound. The Goleta natives 
blend acoustic and electric guitars with lyrics from the 
heart about love, friendships, and life. 

On their second release, "Pale," Toad told a down-
beat tale and struggled with ghosts from the past. But 
Fear promises to be happier and different from Toad 's 
past efforts. 

"'Fear' is more upbeat, and it combines elements 
of our pa t albums and some new idea ," Nichol

with ." 

learly. despite its ini tiall y rebelliou image, 
ocial Di tortion has s uccumb to the norlll s of being 

marketable, like it o r nol. 
Dane ll said, " We can' t just it around and push 

ourse lves away from [commerciality! al l the time. 
Everywh.:re we go, the re's some thing to do with it. 
and that' s j ust a part of life. 1 t' not that we have to 
enjoy it - that 's not really what we're about, but 
that' s the way things work . Now, being on Epic 
Records, things get do ne ri ght the fi rs t time, and we 
can more or less just worry about the music. Jt has its 
advantages." 

Danell elaborated further on the benifit of com-
merciali sm. He said, " We definit e ly had conlidence 
in ourse lves, but we weren ' t that anti-e tablishment 
that we 'd go live on a desert is land and just play 
music for the coconuts. Of course we want to ex pose 
our music to more people. It didn ' t start out a 
bu ine s, it just evolved into that. I hate to ay it, but 
we gOlla pay our rent , no maile r what we do. And if 
we weren ' t doing Illusic, I'd be painting cars or 
something:' Appare ntl y, Soc ia l Distort ion's rebel-
liou image is j ust that - an image, and a flee ting 
one. 

The concens are probably Social Distortion' s 
strongest point , and the place where progres~ and 
experience a re most visible. Danel l :,aid, "That's 
what we've a lway~ done - just been a live band, 
basically. People are being nooded with these bands 
who don' t tour - they put out videos and tapes, and 
if they do tou r, they j ust play their tape and dance to 
it. That's something we've never had to lkal with, 
because we've always been playing livc. Nothing' s 
better than playing live:' 

There is omething for everyone in Social 
Distortion 's li ve shows. Dane ll said, "1 think wc're 
getting a really diverse ;)udience. There might be 
surfers there, and ome cross-over deadheads, and 
there still might be a few hard-core kids. I t'~ fortu-
nate that we attract a lo t of kids. I th ink our audience 
is expanding as we are growing." 

Attempting to explai n why Social Distortion is 
being considered n ne w band, having existed for 
almost ten years, Dane ll said, " I g uess now it 's okay 
to like us, whereas fi ve years ago it wasn'\. We're 
doing the same thing we've always done. It 's all the 
way we want to hear It. " 

Danell continued , " We're the ones playing it, so 
we have to like it. We' ll still be doing t hi~ 20 year~ 
from now, whether we're silling on our front porch, 
or if we 're doing it at Dodger's tadium.:' 

It is more likely tha: tile commerciality that comes 
with a major label has simply made Social Di~ tortion 
more avai lab Ie, and more acceptab le . Ah - America. 
Now we can see a seasoned band. with nearly a 
decade of play ing under its belt , thraShi ng away at 
the New Mu ic Fes ti val, and we have this tine 
count ry's free-enterprise system to thank for it. Its 
reputation indicates th at Soc ial Distortion is a live 
act not to be missed. 

A ked if he had anyth ing to add, Danell simply 
sa id, "Yeah - peace - peace. man." Now that's 
marketable. 

stated. "This is not a continuatio n of the past. We 
had to prove to ourselves that wecould grow. and we 
incorporated a new e lectric sound." 

The band wrote 35 songs for Fear, recorded 20, 
and ultimately cut the 13 that are on the album. "It 
was qu ite difficult to p ick which o ne to record and 
put on the album because they a re all good songs. 
We' ll put some of the songs that didn' t make it on B-
sides and casselles which our fans can get through 
our club," said Nicho l. 

Nichol credits the new elements to the influe nce 
of Neil Young, but his bigge t infl uences are the 
other members of the band . 

"When [ started, R.E.M., U2, and the Po lice 
turned me on. r am part of the post-punk movement, 
where anyone could pick up a guit a r and start writing 
and playing music. Ultimately, my friends - Glen, 
Dean, and Randy - are my big influence and push 
my creativity ." 

The New Music Festi val at the Price Center wi ll 
mark Toad The Wet Sprocket 'S first concert in San 
Diego County. They may do an acoustic set o n May 
10 at Soho, a coffeeho use located a t 1045 U ni vers ity 
Ave. , but this is a tentative how. 

Toad will be sharing the spo tlight with Social 
Distortion, Robyn Hitchcock, and local band Daddy 
Longlegg . This year's New Mus ic Festival hould 
be even better than last year's, and wi th Toad The 
Wet Sprocket a a co-headliner, everyone is guaran-
