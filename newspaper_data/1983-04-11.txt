Bottom Line 
• Latest Star Wars Saga IS Reagan's Dark Side 

ByCANOLE 
Staff Write r 

Darth Vader and the 
Imperial Governor stood 
threateni ngly on opposite 
sides of Princess Leia. "This 
Imperial battle station's 
operational status will usher 
in a new era of Imperial 
techn ical supremacy. Your 
petty alliance will no longer be 
of any concern to us, After 
today s demonstration , no one 
will dare to oppose Imperial 
decrees, not even the senate," 

Leia looked at him with 
contempt. "Force will never 
keep the Empire together. 
Force has never kept anything 
togetherfor very long. You're a 
foo li s h man , Governor . 
Foolish men often choke to 
death on their own delusions." 

This conversat ion from the 
1977 fi lm Star Wars is an 

example of how science fiction 
becomes reality in our lives. 

The plot of this remake of 
Star Wars, written by 
President Reagan, is intended 
to develop towards the 
completion of a space-based 
laser weapons force. T his final 
link in hiS nuclear chain is a 
react ion to the grow ing 
all iance opposed to his nuclear 
ar mament poli cie s and 
negotiations program titled 
START. Completion of th is 
production could be released in 
the fu ture as START Wars . 

Remakes tend to become 
disasters because they lack the 
attention to detail and quality 
found in t he original. By 
referring to the original, a 
person may better understand 
the complexity, feasibility and 
repercussions of deplOYing a 
laser weapons force. 

On March 24 , Ronald 
Reagan began his new starring 
role as the Imperial Space 
Governor by theatrically 
proposing the United States 
should invest in a laser anti-
ballistic missile defensive 
force. 

To justify this expenditure, 
Reagan continued his routine 
storyline of casting Soviet 
Premier Yuri Andropov as the 
ultimate evil, Darth Vader. 
with his supposedly superior 
nuclear arsenal and desi re to 
take over this planet through 
an eventual nuclear war. 

Reagan envisions that these 
space weapons will usher in a 
new era of US technical 
supremacy which will "render 
nuclear weapons impotent and 
obsolete," . 

The estimated cost of these 
Laser Reagan ray guns will be 

an astronomical $200 billion 
for the initial installation and 
$50 billion annually mainte-
nance. ThiS sum dwarfs the 
budget of our current space 
program. Unlike the Mercury 
and Apollo space flights which 
gave us pride in American 
technology and spirit of 
adventure, this venture will 
only cause paranoia. 

Greater than-the cost Will be 
the critical mass of technolog: 
needed to crea te these

exist. Even if the US could 
produce an improbably 95 
percent effective system, one 
out of every twenty Soviet 
ICBM missiles would be able 
to penetrate our defenses, 
total i ng 1 ,5 00 nuclear 
warheads. 

The greatest problem With 
these Death Stars is their total 

vulnerability to a cruise 
missIle attack. Like the 
tactical commander in Slar 
Wars one can logically reason 
"The Death Star's defenses 
were designed to fend offlarge-
scaled assault s A small 
fighter should be able to slip 
through ItS defenSive screens. 
Apparently they are convinced 
that their defensive weaponry 
can fend of any attack," 

Our country's scientifIc 
community, known for their 
knowledge and abililty to 
manipulate the force of the 
atom could be type cast as the 
Jedi Knights , Reagan is calling 
for a return of thejedi, "those 
who gave us nuclear weapons, 
to turn their great talents now 
to the cause of mankind and 
world peace."

President Reagan's Own Future START Wars 
continued from page 3 
this intellectual adventurt' 
might first heed the wisdom of 
the Jedi master Yoda, whose 
eyes were ironically modeled 
after the eyes of Albert 
Einstein , fa ther of atomic 
energy Yoda warned his Jedl 
to beware the dark side of the 
force. It IS eaSily develooed in 
times of war (WWII), but a 
'"tea\'y price is pa id for the 
power it brings. 

Obi Wan Kenobl added, ''In 
many ways, the Jedi were too 
good for their own health. 
They put too much trust in the 
stability of the Republic, 
failing to realize that while the 
body might be sound. the head 
was growing diseased and 
feeble, leaving it open to 
manipulation by the Empe-

.. 

ror. 

Obi Wan Kenobi was the 
wise warrior who told Luke 
Skywalker of the Clone Wars 
and the IIlternal corruptIOn of 
the Empire_ Like Kenobi , the 
American jou rn a li~ts were 
·mce dedicated warriors of 
words as they covered the 
Vietnam warofthe6Oti and the 
Watergate scandal of the 70s 
.:Ione years. 

Today, however. they 
provide limited and often 
unrealiable information 
concerning the Imperial 
Governor's and Darth Vader's 
atomic forces. Without their 
former search for in-depth 
knowledge they have become 
susceptible to manipulation by

both major powers. Their 
growmg feebleness has caused 
Skywalker to become confused 
and mistrust ing towards those 
who claim to know t he waysof 
the force. 

As the head of the Imperial 
government i. losing control 

a~ director, the legblauve 
body IS gaining new respect for 
being able to act on their own. 
In a change of their routllle 
performances, the US Houseof 
Represen tatives qua lifiE'ti 
themselves to become the 
support ing cast for the an ti-
nuclear alliance_ For their 
audition, House members of 
the US Foreign AffairS 
Committee presented a well-
written and directed nuclear 
freeze resolution to oppose the 
Imperial Governor 's script for 
our future . ThIS one act 
audition is expected to become 
a full Ho u se winning 
product ion this week. 

The5e protest actions of the 
House of Representative:, wen: 
once more commonly attnbu 
ted to the actiVists of the 6(}..; , 
who could be typecast a the 
Independent rebel Han Solo 
and his long hai red Wookle 
companion Chewbacca. When 
the Empire struck back at 
these rebels at Kent State, 
they became frozen in a 
suspended anima tion. The 
anti·nuclear alliance IS 
keeping the fires burning to 
draw these Solos out of 
hibernation as their last hope. 

There is another. One who 
knows the evil outcome of 

following the dark side of the 
force. On who stands between 
the imp os ing Impe ri al 
Governor and Darth Vader. A 
promising new star is being 
mtroduced in the challenging 
role of Princess Leia, Petra 
Kelly, leader of the sma ll rebel 
alliance , the anti-nuclear 
Gret'n Party_ She symboliles 
the "other" path to be taken, 
3\\,ay from increased nuclear 
armament. Hers IS the path of 
negot ia tions 

If the Deat h Stars become a 
reality they will be a violation 
of the 1972 ABM treaty, the 
only arms agreement to 
oontrol the two superforces. 
The treaty states, "Each party 
undertakes not to develop, 
test, or deploy ABM systems or 
oomponents which are sea· 
based , air based or space· 
based." 

Reagan once again argues 
that we must cons tantly 
strengthen our forces against 
the ultimate e\ II Darth Vader, 
t.""en If our actions might 
endanger a mutually nego-
tiated treatv 

Is Darth Vader (the Soviets) 
the ultlamte evil? 1 he Se<:ond 
"Star Wars" episode forced us 
to ree va lu ate our p rio r 
conceptIOns of Vader. During 
the second World War, Vader 
was our ally against one who 
followed the dark side of the 
Force. Today that former 
follower has become our ally 
and Vader is now our enemy. 
In the future , will Darth Vader 
remain a distant enemy or a 
close relative? If we are to

We ha\ c "een Skywalker as 
a person unsure of who he is, 
where he ('tOle from and what 
his purpose is. Skywalker is 
the classical everyman and 
everywoman, looking for 
someone to help them deter a 
death caused by a nuclear 
holocaust. 

Before becoming a Jedi. 
Skywalker had to look at the 
lack of commitment In hiS life. 

As Yoda observed, "This one 
I have watched a long ti me. All 
his life htls he looked away. To 
the hOrIZon to the sky. to the 
ft t ure. ever his nllnd on 
where he ""'as, on what he wa~ 
doing. Advent ure, excitement. 
AJedi craves not these things. 
\- )lJ are reckless_" 

Obi Wan warned him of 
trying to confront others with 
only partial understanding. 

"You're not ready yet. You 
shll have much to learn. If you 
end your training now, if you 
choose the easy path as Vader 
did - you will become an 
agent of evil. Be patient. Use 
the Force for knowledge and 
defense, not as a weapon. 
Don't give in to hate, anger and 
fear. They lead the way to the 

dark ~lde." 
Sk vwalker asked Yoda 

"How will I know the good side 
from the bad?" 

Yoda replied, "Clouded I

When Reagan released hiS 
pre· production scenano for a 
space weapons program, the 
scientific community was 
unanimous in its appraisal. 

Director of the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center 
Wolfgang Panofsky commen· 
led , "I know of no develop-
ments. no technical advan-

Director of the _ cience and

Kosta Tsipis warned, "The 
Critical fail u re of all these 
defenSive systems is tha t they 
must be perfect. Less than that 
and they are rUinOUS. What 
the president is offering is a 
cruel hoax." 

Nobel laureate in physics 
from Cornell University Hans 
Beth fears, "Idon't think itcan

Laura is Busy 
ro 1 e Try Non-acadelllic 

Learning About Life ByGL~~JJ:~rMURA 
Are you a s tudent pursuin~ to jobs outs ide academia. Laura is si tt ing outdoors in a 

law n chai r a nd readi ng the LA 
Times, bu t instead of relaxing, 
she look anxiou: soon s he 
will be delivering her Thesis 
Defense, the last step before 
_ he receives her PhD. She 
hasn't had much leisure time 
these last two mont hs, since 
she has been busy writing her 
dissertat ion. 

Actuall y, Laura has n 't had a 
real surplus of leisure ti me in 
about fou r-a nd-a-half years; as 
a graduate student in 
Inorganic Chemi. try she has 
spent rough ly 40 to 50 hours a 
week in lab research , and has 
taugh t clas e as a Teaching 
As i tant. Chemistry grad 
st udents usua lly take abou t 
twelve graduate a nd upper-
division courses, a nd TA a 
total of five quarters to meet 
their graduation require-
ments. 

To be honest, Laura ha 
been very busy for about eight-
and-a-half years, which 
comtitute ... her enllre college 
career Although Laura did

of the kind of stu ff that makes 
people seek her fr iends hi p. So 
why is he anxious? Certainly 
s he' ll be able to pull off her 
Thesis Defense and Disserta-
t ion w it hout a snag. 

Laura h a spent her 
graduate educat ion preparing 
for a job in a private industry 
that wi ll allow her to earn a 
begi nn in g sa lary of about 
$30,000 to $40,000 a year; quite 
a um when compared to the 
grad student's stipend of about 
$8,000 a year. The problem IS 
the lack of jobs curren t ly 
avai lable in private industry. 

Lau ra leans forward in her 
c hair to share a bit of 
info rmat ion wit h me: 

"I interviewed with large 
chemical and oil companies -
Exxon and Union Carbide -
and found that they are not 
hiring at a normal le\·el. There 
are few upenings, and many of 
the companies have hiring 
freezes on. l'nfortunatl'h. I he

enable someone like Laura to 
rema in out of work for long: 
after graduation, careful 
budgett 1l1g migh t a llow her !-.ix 
weeks to two mont hs before 
her savingb run out. 

"Post-docs," post -doctorate 
jobs that are simi lar 111 nature 
to graduate rebearch jobs, are 
more readi ly avai lable than 
the jobs in private indust ry, 
due in part to their 
approximate average wage of 
$14,000 to $16,000 a year. 
Some grad st uden ts do post-
docs to train for assistant 
professorships (whic h bring in 
app r oximate ly $16,000 to 
$20,000 a year), and later, 
professorships. But Laura 
alludes to a ' itua tion that s he, 
too, may fi nd herself in: 

" [n general, the job market 
is tight. not just for me. A lot of 
people who would have 
preferred positions in private 
induslry are taking post-

Toxic Waste at Issue 
-

continued from page 1 
the Environmental Carcin-
~nesis Laboratory at the 
UCSD Medical School, offers 
this scenario as a Catch 22: 
"Assume a waste site on 
public land is to cost $4 million 
to clean up . The s tate 
government IS required to 
come up with half of tha t, or 
two million bucks. They jus t 
might not have it. " And what 
happens then, according to 
Arnold? "Presumably not h-
ing." 

Not only could EPA Chief 
Stephany offer no solution, 
but he also seemed befuddled 
on the whole issue. ''I'm glad 
you told me about this 
situa tion . I didn ' t know 

anythin~ about it. I'll have to 
check It out before Wed-
nesday's forum." 

Arnold and Stephany will 
both appear as guest speakers 
a t t he Wednesday evening 
forum . 

Delays can prove costly, if 
not harmful. One exam ple is 
an incident that took place in 
southern California where 
drums containing dangerous 
PCBs were fou nd dumped in a 
fie ld . During the six months it 
took to decide how to deal with 
it, hunters shot the barrels full 
of holes, caus ing the toxic 
chemicals to drain into the soil 
and forcing the s ta te to spend 
hundreds of thousa nds of 
dollars more than it would 
ha ve cost to pick up the barrels 
before they leaked. 

Another exa mple IS the well-
publicized Stringfellow site in 
the town of Glen Avon m 
Riverside County. The 
extremely toxic waste site was 
abandoned In 1972, but the 
waste remained. The EPA 
recently designated it as one of 
the three most dangerous sites 
in the state. . 

The EPA designation was 
not applied though, until after 
the chemical-laden water had 
washed through the site and 
into the community. 

Many of the town's 6,500 
residents have suffered 
urinary tract infectIOns, skin 

problems, boils, stomach 
ailments and severe head· 
aches. 

Penny Newman, a neighbor-
hood acti v is t and chief 
spokesperson for the comm un· 
ity has been waging an 
extensive lobbying campaign 
to have the problem resolved . 
Newman was s la ted to appear 
a t the CalPIRG forum, but 
a pparent ly another dangerous 
dumps ite ha s j u s t been 
discovered this week in Glen 
Avon and consequently she 
has been forced to remain at 
home to deal wit h the problem. 

Small companies have been 
contributing greatly to the 
problem as well. A " s mall 
generator" is defined as a 
locale that generates less than 
about 2,200 pounds of toxic 
was tes per month. 

According to the Hazardous 
Waste Management Project 
report , a locally conducted 
s urve y ha s s how n tha t, 
"Almost 60 percent of all the 
small generators did not know 
they were gene ra ting 
hazardous wastes," Kaufman 
said. "I( they don't know they 
are generating hazard ous 
wastes, it is very unlikely that 
they're going to extra effort 
a nd expense to dispose of it 
properly." 

It is believed by some that 
small com panies in California 
would have a more difficult 
time illega lly dumping toxic 
waste then small compa nies in 
other states. 

Arnold shares this notion. 
"Regulations in Cahfornia are 
tight enough now, if only 
everyone would adhere to 
them. For example, small 
companies in almost all other 
states are allowed to dump up 
to 1,000 gallons of toxic waste 
per month. In California, no 
company can dump any toxic 
waste WIthout a permit." 

A permit can be obtained 
trom the City Sewer System 
Company for $85.

San Diego adopted an 
ordinance in May of ] 982 
requiring firms using tOXIC 
substances to submit to 
inspections and to list all the 
hazardous matenals they use 
in their operations. This 
ordll1ance was weakened, 
however, when an advisory 
panel declared that health 
officers had the right to 
withold from the public 
information that would 
disclose business trade 
secrete;, proprietary interest or 
information involving 

national defense. 
The adVIsory panel action 

was in response to industry 
leaders who were concerned 
that publtc disclosure of tOXIC 
rna tenals cou Id place some 
firms at a competitIve 
disadvantage. 

According to DaVId 
Mulliken, an attorney who 
represented major busines ess 
and the Greater San DIego 
Chamber of Commerce in the 
county ordinance hearings, 
"Information on where such 
materials are stored could be 
used by insurgent groups or 
for industrial espIOnage."

Toxic Waste Dump Sites at Issue Kirkpatrick Spurs Debate 
continued 'from page 7 
withold information about 
certain toxic materials from 
the public might conflict with 
the California Public Records 
Disclosure Act. He said city 
lawyers "will look into the 

s~tu.ation " . bef~re drafting 
~Imllar Iqpslahon affecting 
mdustry WIthin San Diego city 
limits. 

Swett will hand down a 
ruling Wednesday morning, 
just hours before the start of 
the CalPIRG forum . 

In a related proposal , a 
Hazardous Waste Surveilance 
program is also before the City 
Council. Passage would 
require industries to pay a 
yearly fee to support a 
research organization to 
examine toxic waste treat· 
ment and care. This is already 
a state law, but there is a 
clause in it that stipulates that 
if the local health officer wants 
to enforce it, he can, but he 

may also choose not to do so. 
Widespread feeling among 

officials is that other cities in 
the county are looking toward 
the City of San Di~ and will 
most likely follow it s decision. 

If the San Diego City 
Council approves either 
proposal, It will take 
approximately 30 day to begin 
enforcing it. 

Arnold puts the issue into 
perspective: "Toxic waste is 
sort of a scare word . You can 
dump chlorine in a pool and it 
will evaporate into the air 
which is dangerous, but it is 
technically against t he law to 
dump, say, a half·gallon can of 
it in a garbage can. You can't 
burn gasoline at a campsite at 
the beach, but it's okay to burn 
it with your car." 

Arnold feels the key is to 
educate the public on just 
what to do with toxic wstes. 
"Most people feel that tOXIC 
waste is useless . If it is 

processed the right way it can 
either be reused or neutral· 
ized. Eighty-five percent of 
West Germany's toxic wastes 
are made useful in one way or 
another." 

Today, more than two 
million chemicals exist, with 
5,000 new ones being added 
every year. Most are harmless, 
but some cause birth defects, 
mutations, cancer and other 
diseases. As the level of toxic 
chemical use increases, so does 
the potential for human 
exposure. The first step in 
solving the problem is to be 
educated about t he problem. 

Also appeari ng at th e 
CalPlRG forum Wednesday 
evening will be Dr. Ruth 
Heifetz , visiting senior 
lecturer on Family and 
Community Health at the 
UCSD Medical School, and

Zelnik continued, "Whether

the rights of both speakers and 
listeners, places part of the 
campus communIty in · the

" censors. 

The regents met to vote on a

pass, however those who voted 
for it included the usually

entitled , "Invi ted Speakers

A great deal of national 
discussion has been brought 
about by these incidents, and 
hopefully , reasonable minds 
will prevail in efforts to 
maintain free speech at 
universities Universities 
cannot fulfill theIr purposes 
without diversity of ideas and 
disagreement. "Where 
everyone thinks alike," wrote 
the late Walter Lippman, "no 
one thinks very much." 

Job Hunting Expected to Improve 

At their March 18 meeting, 
the regents recommended 
adopting the "Resolution of 
1983 Jefferson Lecture , 
Berkeley Campus," which 
in cludes the following 
wording: "We reaffirm that 
when persons or organizations 
engage in actions impermis-
sible under university and 
campus regulations, appropri-
ate disciplinary measures 
must be taken at the campus 
level. The regents hereby 
instruct the president to call 
upon Chancellor Heyman to 
take whatever steps are 
necessary to maintain the 
University of California. 
Berkeley, as a forum for the 
free, unfettered, and open 
exchange of all views and 
ideas." 

It is interesting to note that 
a week after the Kirkpatrick 
incident in Berkeley, the US 
State Department barred 
Hortensia Allende, the widow 
of Chile 's murdered president , 
from entering thecountry for a 
10·day speaking tour .

the 56% returned. 66% were in

Science Notebook 
Wildflowers 
Are Stalked 

By PAT BERGMAN 
Staff Writer 

On Saturday, April 9, 15 
UCSD students and their 
instructor set out from school 
to "stalk the wildflower." 

In a two and a half hour 
outin~ sponsored by the 
UCSD s Recreation Depart-
ment, Mitchell Beauchamp, 
the Principal Consulting 
Botanist & Horticulturalist 
with Pacific Biological 
Services Inc., led students on a 
tour along the beach and cliff 
areas just west of the campus 
in order to observe and identify 
various plants and plant parts. 

The students - most with 
an obvious interest in botany 
or horticulture - observed , 
questioned, and took notes on 
a wide variety of plant life. 

Beauchamp related the 
hi s tor y and interesting 
features of the plants he 
pointed out. He covered 
diverse interes ts in the p'lant 
life, for as he pinted out , 'One 
person is interested in the 
native American use of the 
plant , while another will 
question whether or not it is 
edible, and s till another will 
want to know if it is poisonous. 
The group of consumptive use 
is always something I trv to 
address." He also pointed out 
details of identification of the 
plants, and covered them as a 
social community. 

Mitchell Beauchamp, botanis t and horticulturalist, led the 
pack in flower identification. 

Everyone seemed to enjoy 
the afternoon and it gave the 
students a chance not only to 
observe and learn about 
wildflowers, but also to talk 
with an expert on the subject

w ho could advise them and 
gi ve them further sou rces for 
informa tion. 

Mitchell Beauchamp's work 
rovers many different aspects 
of botany and hort iculture, 
including research on plants. 
Currently, he is experiment-
ing with various plants for 
landscaping that do not 
require water (other than 
normal rainfall). 

It seems to be an idea that is 
ahead of its time , for 
Beauchamp says, "The 
problem is , we bring in a lot of 
new stuff and grow it , and 
nobody knows that it's good . 
Plus, there's no stimulation 
for people to plant low·water-
use plants. The general public 
has yet to become aware that 
we are going to have water 
rationing i n S o uthe r n 
California. They th ink tha t 
technology will sa ve us; it 
won 't. People won 't be able to 
irrigate th eir landsca pes in the 
summer ... so we keep moving 
along here. t rying to bring in 
new materials."

In the Umtcd . tales today. 

30 to 40 percen 1 of a II cou pies 
have difficult y conceiving a 
child. due to a variet y of 
reasons. includin,g venereal 
disease . blocked fallopian 
tubes. endometriosis, damage 
done by IUD's, and low sperm 
coun t. Unlil recently, these 
factor, among others, have 
prevented many potential 
parents from having their own 
biological progeny. But now 
these couples'- can concel\,e 
through a ne\(' process called 
ill vitro fertilization or embryo 
/rall sfer, more common'" 
known as "test lube babies.'; 

In Februar}. the Del art·

To date. 300 potential 
parenls are on the watltng ltst. 
70 couples have a lready paid 
the fees for t he program. a nd 
even have attempled 

fertilizations. Thus far, no 
pregnancies have occured. 

Couples must go through 
several interviews. and there 
are many prerequisites for 
participation In the program. 
The wife must have a 
functional uterus, and at leasl 
one functional ovarv which is 
acce ible to laparoscopy for 
egg rel rieva l. The husband 
must have sperm; no donors 
are used in thi s program . The 
wife must be etO years old . or 
less. and they are \\ arned of a

Participants In the program 
are told t hat their chances for 
a S u c c e s s f u lin I' i / l' 0 
fertilization are about 15 to 20 
percent. Thu s far, there have 
been more than 200 pregnan· 
cles and 120 live births of 
healthy babIes utiliZing thIS 
technique. 

Once the program requIre-
ment'; are met. the couples are 
given a detaIled explanatIOn of 
the procedure. A hormone 
which stimulates 0\ ulatlon 
(Clomiphene citrate) is then 
gl\en to the \\oman 
l'ltrasound is lIsed to monitor 
the progress of the egg. and 
horml)I1l' Ic\ t+· are monitored

there is much more to his field

Strange Fates & Freak 
Innings Foil Batsmen 

By JEFF SAVAGE 
Staff Writer 

When third base co-captain 
jay Sierzchula went down 
with a leg injury last week, it 
was just another of a string of 
setbacks that the UCSD 
baseball team has suffered 
this year. Inopportune 
rainouts, injuries which 
dismantled the outfield, and 
the theft of all the team's 
equipment, roupled with this 
latest injury, must have left 
Coach Lyle Yates asking 
himself, "What's next?" 

The answer is: No more 
Mike Brown. The All·District 
catcher and pitcher, the only 
real power the Tritons had left 
in the line-up, is gone. The 
senior ro·captain is through . 
Finished. Kaput. Brown has 
been declared ineligible due to 
grades. See ya later. Adios. 

In the meantime, the 
Tritons have hit the skids. 
They had lost three straight 
going into Saturday 's 

doubleheader at Westmont 
and with the absence of 
Brown's bat, they dropped two 
more, running the streak to 
five. 

In the first game, the 
Warriors rocked Triton 
pitcher Eric Reynolds for four 
runs in the first on their way 
to posting a 7·2 win . Reynolds 
settled down after the rude 
welcome and went the 
distance. He simply showed 
too little too late. Brian 
Kummer tripled home Don 
Petersen and scored on a base 
hit by Charles Morris to 
acrount for UCSD's two runs. 

UCSD's young line·up (four 
freshmen and five sopho· 
mores) had to go up against 
Westmont's ace pitcher Kevin 
Ochs in the second game. Ochs 
had already beaten Pt. Loma 
and shut out both Cal Baptist 
and Southern Cal College in 
league play this year. 

The Tritons had a good 
chance of going home with a 
split, however, as they jumped 
out to an early 2-0 lead in the 
serond. Charles Morris, who 
has been playing superior ball 
of late. walked to get things

Katie True collected the Win 
with relief help from Vanessa 
Davis as Triton offense and

and buried WhittIer College, 
10-3. 

The Tritons could do 
nothing wrong in that second 
game of the doubleheader as 
Layton found herself on base 
four times in four trips. She 
doubled, singled twice, and 
was hit by a pitch . Catcher 
Cathy Williamson and 
shortstop Pam Hardaway 
teamed up to shoot down 
Whittier base stealers like clay

with diving catches that had

"You played good ball for 
four innings and then handed 
the game to them on a silver 
platter," Coach Colleen Wight 
told the team between games. 
"You didn't call fly balls; you 
made baserunning errors; you

Women's Tennis Still #1 

Netters Go To 12·2 With Split 
By SARA DENMAN 

Staff Writer 
The UCSD women's tennis 

team chalked up another 
victory Thursday over Point 
Lorna Collese, giving the team 
an impressive 12-1 record for 
the season. The Tritons, 
ranked first among the 256 
schools in the NCAA's 
Division III, remain unde-
feated in their division. The 
highlight of the Point Lorna 
meet was the doubles match of 
Lisa Gilbert and Nadine 
Akimoto. They made an 
outstanding comeback in the 
third set, reviving from an 0-5 
deficit to win the match 4-6, 6-
2,7-6. The fact that they had to 
play the tiebreaker4n the dark 
added a little extra suspense to 
the game. (point Lorna's courts 
are not lighted). According to 
Coach Liz Dudash, the team as 
a whole performed well , 
although concentration was a 
little low due to a long spring 
break. Nevertheless, UCSD 
won the meet 7-2, and the only 
two losses were against strong 
opponents. 

On Friday, the girls put up a 
good fight against Division I 
Cal State Fullerton, but were 
finally defeated 5-4. Note-
worthy performances were 
Nadine Akimoto's 7-6, 6-3 
victory over Paula Dolberg and 
Dina Neal's three set defeat of 
Sue Bojalski. Coach Dudash 
was also happy with doubles 
teams Akimoto-Gilbert and 
Sturdivant-Neal. Both teams 
gave a strong showing against 
Cal State Fullerton in matches 
that extended into a third set. 

Friday's meet brought 
UCSD's season record to 12-2, 
with losses only to Division I 
teams. According to Dudash, 
the girls enjoy playing 
Division I teams because it 
gives them better competition 
and experience than the 
Division III teams offer. They 
hope to maintain their 
excellent record for the next 
rankings which come out in 
early May. 

The Tritons moved into the 
No. 1 position in February 
when they defeated Occidental 
college, last year's top 
women's team. The two teams 
will compete for the No.1 spot 

again this Saturday at 
Occidental in what looks to be 
an exciting meet. 

The squad's top two players 
hold high ran kings in the 
NCAA Division III. Sophomore 
Kathy Sturdivant is ranked 
No.2 in the nation, and junior 
Lisa Gilbert in No. 12. The 
team is looking forward to this 
year's nationals, which will 
open on May 9 at Pomona 
College. Between now and 
then, Coach Dudash's group 
has several more opponents to 
contend with, starting off with 
Westmont in their next home 
meet this Friday, April 15 at 3 
pm on the Muir Courts . 

Soft baIlers Go 1-3 
continued from page 13 
the hole at second. Grace 
Bearis bunted and took first on 
an error, allowing Williamson 
to score. 

What should have been 
UCSD's second tally became a 
long double when Jan Martin 
laced a hard shot down the 
first base line and into the 
corner. Martin crossed the 
plate with a home run before 
the ball was returned to the 
infield, only to be returned to 
second when the umpire ruled 
the ball dead when it bounced 
out of play. 

In the second game, Fogarty 
and Suzanne Shull scored on 
three UCR errors and a smgle 
by Williamson. Fogarty took 
first when the fi rst baseman 

pulled her foot off the bag 
before taking the throw. She 
took third on the error at short 
that put Shull on first and 
scored when Keene got on with 
the help of an error by the third 
baseman. Shull scored on 
Williamson's single but Keene 
was thrown out trying to score 
behind her. 

The week's activities bring 
the Tritons' record to 204 in 
conference play and 2-13 
overall. They take the road 
again against Loyola Mary-
mount, University of San 
Diego, University of La Verne, 
UC Riverside, and Whittier 
before returnmg home to play 
USD in a doubleheader 
beginning at 3 pm Tuesday, 
April 26.

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

Staff Writen 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT, As you read this 
column, care to guess where San Di~o Chargers quarterback 
Dan Fouts is? He's in New York talkmg with Chet Simmons. 
Care to guess who Chet Simmons is? He's the USFL 
Commissioner. Care to guess what they're talking about? 
They're discussing the possibility of a new USFL contract for 
Dan Fouts. Care to guess what team Dan Fouts won't be playing 
for this coming season? Dan Fouts won't be playing for the San 
Diego Chargers this coming season. Care to guess what league 
Dan Fouts will no longer be involved with because he is not only 
disgu sted with his own contract but with the whole players' 
association? Dan Fouts will no longer be playing in the NFL. 
Care to guess what lea8'1.le Dan Fouts will be in this coming 
season? He'll be in the USFL. Care to guess when Dan Fouts will 
make the decision? He'll make it in plenty of time for the 
Chargers to trade their first round picks and a quality player for 
the first pick in the draft in order to get Stanford sensation 
quarterback John Elway. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. After informing Guardian 
readers that we WOil a su bstantial amount of money thanks to a 
terrific Las Vegas line of 50-Ion North Carolina State to win the 
NCAA tourney, did we really get three requests between the both 
of us for large cash loans? It figures. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. From The Sporting News: "Take 
another look at that Loni Anderson poster, heralding the arrival 
of the Tamp'a Bay Bandits and the United States Football 
League. You II note that Loni is gripping an NFL football bearing 
the signature of Commiss ioner Pete Rozelle." 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. For many years, NCAA 
basketball referees have been asking for a change in the rules for 
foul s hots near the end of a game. Currently when players are 
fouled because their opponents are losing and desperate to get 
back IOtO the game, they are allowed only a one-and-one 
opportunity (a chance at two free throws only If the first is 
made). This happens despite a bonus situation (the other team 
has committed more than six team fouls) during the game's flOal 
two minutes. The rules encourage intentional fouling because, if 
the first foul shot IS missed, theloslOgtea m has a chance to make 
up a basket. Referees could call intentional fouls (allowing two 
shots regardless of whether the first is made), but that has been a 
judgment call. Up to now; the rules committee approved the refs' 
request this past week to make such a foul automatically worth 
two s hots. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. The National Basketball Association 
Players Union would not give in to owners' demands that the 
rest of the 1983 season be cancelled. According to Guardian 
sources, the NBA owners lose a combined average of $1.15 
million every week the players dribble the basketball. The longer 
the season lasts, the larger the deficit and vice versa .

A 15-0 shutout by Dominguez Hills leaves the team with a 3-1 record. 
BASEBALL-

Last week's losses to Southern Cal College (5-4, 13 innings), Whittier (9-4), and 
Westmont (7-2, 6-2) leave the struggling club with a 5-21 overall record, 2-8 in league

UCSD lost to USIU 493-478 last week, leaving the Tritons with a 7-4 record before 

they swing into a Wednesday match against the San Diego Golf Academy. The contest 
begins at 1 pm at Torrey. 

SOFTBALL-
The Tritons' second win of the season was sandwiched among three losses last week. 

UCSD defeated Whittier 10-3 in the nightcap of a doubleheader after losing the first 
game 4-1. Against UC Riverside on Saturday, the team went t02-130n the year with 8-1 
and ~2 losses. Loyola Marymount hosts UCSD Tuesday afternoon. 

MEN'S TENNIS -
Two losses to Div. I schools SDSU (6-3) and USD (9-0) were balanced against 

Saturday'S 8-1 victory over Occidental and should do littIeto harm the Div. III squad's 
#4 ranking in the nation. 

WOMEN'S TENNIS -
The Tritons continued their mastery over Div. III schools with a 7·2 victory 

WNnesdayover Pt. Lorna, but then lost to Div.l Fullerton State 5-4 on Saturday. The 
#1 ranked squad is now 12-2. 

TRACK AND FIELD -
The results from the meet of April 9 are finally in. the UCSD women finished second 

behind Fullerton State in the four team meet, but the men finished last. Last weekend , 
no team results were kept for the Tritons at the UC Riverside Invitational.

Status Quo: Great White Hope 
continued from page 1 
coll ec tive bids on AS positions. 
Some past examples of thi s 
include the Union of Jewish 
St udents, SAAC , and the Co· 
ops . More rec ent ly (a nd 
currently), UCSD fraternities 
and sororiti e<.; a re assum ing a 
polit ical as well as a social 
presence. 

Even though these groups 
receive no AS funds direct lv, 
t hey have sy m pa th y for 
cer ta in groups that do. Since 
the only t hing the AS is 
expected to do is a llocate 
s t udent ·paid activity fees, 
most candidates unders t and 
the AS in fina ncial terms 
before they run . 

Political mot ives for AS 
candid acy s hould also be 
me n tio n e d eve n t h o u g h 
st r ict ly pol itica l con ce rns 
rarely surface in the elect ion. 
Mos t people with ser ious 
political energy foc us it on 
more worthwh ile purs u its 
than the AS . When an AS post 
is sought for political reasons . 
it's genera ll y because the 
candidate seeks to ins titu· 
tional ize some sort of political 
act ivit y. 

An example of thi s is the 
yea r that San Diego Students 
for Peace captured several 
council seat s, a desk, and a 
futu re for the organi zation. 

Lazines_ a lso comes in; council 
members feel like they 've 
accomplished a lot with very 
li tt le effort when 20-0dd people 
have been forced to hear an 
oral report or vote on a vague 
resolution . 

The moti vations li s ted 
above are not exhaustive; a 
genuine altruis t might run 
someday and hislher cand i· 

dacy w ill reql!ire deeper 
a nalysis. Anomalies always 
do. T his year, the motives are 
s tandard and predic tjl ble. Yet , 
it is still early in the cam paign. 
Other rationale, may emerge 
from the debate, dissent, and 
di scussion that lies ahead . The 
next segment deals with thi s 
by evaluating the campaign 
and the candidates. 

Harris: Vote or Pay Price 
continued from page 1 
people. the followi ng are li kely 
powerful people: AS Council 
me mber s, Res id ent (Ha ll ) 
Ad visors, Student Organi za· 
tion members (Bl ack Student 
Un io n, Co·ops and Enter· 
pri ses, LAGO , Fra tern iti es 
and College Councils). If a 
candidate is endorsed by one of 
th is type of organizat ion, it is 
usually a good indicat ion of the 
candidates leadership ability. 

3) ACCESSABIUTY -
Thi s in vo lve s mainl y 
pres idential candidates. Vote 
for t he candidate who goes to 
th e trouble to meet you . 
Although the chances that you 
will ever see himlher again are 
small, they are certainl y much 
better than the candidate you 
have never even seen . 

4) OVERALL CAMPAIGN 
STRATEG IES AND SLO· 
GANS - Does the campaign 
literature make sense? Is it 

thoughtful ? Does w hat you 
read match what you want? 
Try to read between the line 
and discern the candida te's 
political orientat ion. Is he/ she 
Liberal? Conservat ive? Radical 
Le ft · Win g? Right · Win g? 
Believe it or not, polit ical 
ori ent a ti on ha~ a st rong 
bearing on w hat the candid ate 
w ill do in office, reagardless of 
th e promi es befo r e the 
election. 

5 ) REC ORD - Wh a t 
experience does the candidate 
po ess? Has the person ever 
been in a leadership position? 
If so , how effec t ive was 
he/ she? If you do get a chance 
to talk to cadidates find out 
exactly what they have done, 
and who well t hey did it. 

In my next article I will give 
a run dow n of all t he 
pres idential candidates, theIr 
strength s, their weaknesses, 
and their cha nces.
