Hedgecock Sees Victory as 
Controlled Growth Mandate 

by Sara J. Lowen 
Associate News Editor 

Roger Hedgecock believes his victory over Lou Conde in the 3rd 
District Supervisorial race earlier in the month indicates "that people 
don't want to see San Diego tum into another Los Angeles." 

Hedgecock, 30, feels that because the Board of Supervisors has 
direct responsibility for land development in the unincorporated areas 
of the county, he is in a prime position to prevent Los Angeles-type 
urban sprawl in San Diego. 

Urban sprawl can best be prevented, Hedgecock said in an interview 
Tuesday, by the combined efforts of community planning groups ~d 
the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO). The commuruty 
planning groups should review proposed projects for their area and 
judge whether they will be beneficial while CPO should be looking at 
long range development for the county, he said. 

Roger Hedgecock beams with the euphoria 0/ victory during an Election 
Night interuiew with a reporter from KCSTÂ·Channel 39. Hedgecock will 
officially begin his term as 3rd District Supervisor Jan . 3 . 

The attorney, who will be officially sworn in Jan. 3, emphasized that 
if community planning commissions had previously been more in-
volved in county growth decisions there would not be an urban sprawl 
problem. 

" People can see that managing growth is in their interest," he said. 
In addition to working on growth problems, Hedgecock said he 

believes the supervisors should take action to preserve open space in 
San Diego county. This might be done by purchasing parcels of land 
that have unique eco-systems, he said. 

Hedgecock also said he plans to work actively to speed up the 
proposed purchase of Penasquitos Canyon and the lagoons in North 
County. 

Zoning Controls 
The other way that the Supervisors can preserve open spaces, 

particularly of agricultural lands, is through strict zoning controls, 
which assure that agricultural lands are not developed. "People don't 
realize it," said Hedgecock, " but agriculture is the number one 
business in San Diego CQunty. We should hold on to every bit of 
agriculturalland we've got." 

Hedgecock's environmental concerns also extend to air pollution, 
which he said is "a serious problem because of the freeway-oriented 
lifestyle we lead." The Supervisors, who have control over the Air 
Pollution Control District, can do much to improve San Diego's air 
quality, Hedgecock said. The first step, as he sees it, in controlling air 
pollution, is to set up more monitoring systems to accurately detect 
the sources and patterns of pollution in the county. 

Containing urban sprawl and encouraging housing development in 
the urban areas of the city will cut down on pollution by reducing the 
distance that people travel to work, said Hedgecock. Additionally, the 
hydrocarbons that are emitted into the air when gasoline is pumped 
can be cut back by requiring gas station ownen to install vapor 
recover systems. Hedgecock charged the Board with 'fumbling' on 
this issue in the past and said he will work to insure that vapor 
recovery systems are installed 

In addition to his environmental concerns, one of Hedgecock's other 
areas of high priority on the Board will be to keep property tax in-
creases even with cost of living increases. Hedgecock feels that one 
way to do this is to make the county budget analysts responsible to the 
Board, so that the Board can detennine the priorities of county 
programs. 

Priorities 
"I'm going to be saying a lot about the need to prioritize," 

Hedgecock said. Among the first things "to go" when cuts are made 
will be what Hedgecock called 'welfare for the rich,' such as the seven 
private airports that the county operates for private planes. "The 
county has been supporting the operation of those airports because 
they have been operating with a deficit," Hedgecock said. "We just 
can't tolerate this kind of thing. " 

Hedgecock believes that cuts mUit also be made in the operating 
costs of the Board, which he called "an arrogant remote level of 
govenunent," in tenos of the way it spends the taxpayen money on 
"fancy stationery and blg can" for the Supervisors.

Straw Ballot Sent Out 

Faculty Ponder Semester System 
by Alec Nedelman 

Associate News Editor 

"In your judgement, should the 
University of California change its 
academic year from three quar-
ters to two semesters?" This 
question, being asked of faculty at 
all the UC campuses, was put to 
UCSD faculty last week in the fonn 
of a straw ballot administered by 
the Academic Senate (AS). 

Faculty at the Irvine, Los 
Angeles, Berkeley, Santa Barbara 
and Riverside campuses have 
already voted either officially or in 
a straw vote to implement the 
semester system. Balloting is 
currently proceeding at the other 
campuses. 

According to __ Herbert York, 
Chairman of the Academic Senate, 
San Diego Division, UC President 
Saxon will not institute the change, 
scheduled for fall 1978, "unless the 
change has the substantial backing 
of the faculty." However, York 
said, Saxon has not defined what he 
means by "substantial." 

Saxon has only instructed each 
campus to solicit tile views of its 
faculty and report back to him. 
Then he will make his decision on 
the change. 

The switch to semester, if im-
plemented York said, would be for 
all UC campuses, with the possible 
exception of UC San Francisco, 
which, because of its very small 
size, might be allowed to remain on 
the quarter system. 

Nov. %3 Meeting 
The AS office has asked the 

faculty to return their straw ballots 
by today. Then, according to York, 
the faculty will "devote one half 
hour of the next Academic Senate 
meeting, on Nov. 23, to this topic." 
In early December, at an 
assemblage of representatives of 
all UC academic senates,the 
discussion will continue and a 
recommendation will be made to 
Saxon. 

York emphasized that "the 
straw vote here is not binding on 
our faculty," and that " there is no 
assurance that a vote (at the 
December meeting will produce 
any specific result.") 

In the ballot sent to the UCSD 
faculty, it is also asked: " Whether 
or not you favor doing so, if the 
University did return to the 

semester system, would you prefer 
a Fall semester ending before 
Christmas (and therefore with 
classes beginning the end of 
August ) or a Fall semester ending 
after the Christmas-New Years 
break (and therefore with classes 
beginning as now in late Sep-
tember)?" 

The ballot provides the faculty 
with twenty pages of arguments on 
the semester vs. quarter system 
question. Joseph Gusfield and 
Walter Kohn, chairman and 
member, respectively, of the 
Committee on Educational Policy 
(CEP), present arguments in favor 
of the semester system. Richard 
Dutton, Chairman of the Graduate 
Council, presents arguments in 
favor of the quarter system. In 
addition, a report on the issue 
prepared by a subcommittee of the 
University Committee on 
Educational Policy, is included. 

Informal Survey 
All of the above arguments were 

reflected in an infonnal survey 
conducted by the Triton Times 
over the last two weeks of 20 
faculty department chairs. 
Although most of them were 
speaking as individuals and not for 
their departments, the department 
heads provided an indication of 
how the entire faculty might decide 
this question. 

The UCSD faculty provide an 
additional perspective onto this 
issue. Since this is a relatively new 
campus, most of the faculty have 
taught under both systems. In the 
Triton Times survey, most faculty 
conveyed this experience when 
explaining their vote. 

Eleven of the faculty surveyed 
favored the semester system, five 
favored the quarter, and four were 
still undecided. Those who favored 
the quarter system came from 
both social science and natural 
science departments. A few 
favored the quarter system 
either because their professional 
meetings were in early Sept. or 
they just didn't like the thought of 
beginning classes again in Aug. 

The proponents of the quarter 
system focused on the flexibility of 
that system. "We can offer 11h 
times more courses in the quarter 
system," said one professor. 
" People coasted along" under the 
semester system, said another. A

third professor was for three 
quarters " because the proposed 
semester system would imply 
students covered less material in 
the course of one year. " 

Of the undecideds, most said 
they "could see the advantages of 
both." Two were leaning towards 
the status quo because "there 
would be a lot of paperwork to 
make the change," and because 
"someone can go on leave a little 
easier in a quarter system." 

Ten Weeks Too Short? 
Those department heads 

favoring the semester system 
centered their arguments around 
the feeling that "ten weeks in just 
too short." A few of these 
professors said they would prefer 
the "longer exam period and the 
fact there aren't as many exam 
periods in the year," as is being 
proposed under the semester plan. 

Other advocates of the semester 
system stressed the " non-
interruption of students' work" as 
a key factor in their decision. Many 
classes, they said, span more than 
one quarter and are often in-
terrupted by scheduling conflicts 
with other sequences. In addition, 
it is felt that "when it comes to

To"SeIl" Food 
For Orphans 

Richard Smith of the Trident 
Christian Fellowship has a lot of 
faith in people. 

Smith bought $500 worth of food 
with his own money tel supply 
goods to Casa de Esperanza 
(House of Hope ), a Mexican or-
phanage. 

Now he hopes that people will 
respond by buying the food back 
and donating it to the orphanage. 

" Next Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday from 8 am to 5 pm we 
will be selling the food," said 
Smith. " There aren't any really 
expensive food items as they are 
mostly cans, and the average 
article is no more than a dollar." 

Smith noted that people would be 
paying the same amount as they 
would in a store, with the only 
difference now being that " the kids 
will get the food." 

The orphanage is located just 
s.outh of Tijuana, and is supported 
only by donations. Most of the 
children have either been given up 
by their parents, or have come 
from Mexican authorities. 

"This is our chance to help," said 
Smith.

Abortion: Pro or ConI 
Abortion Is a topic wbleb never quite fades from the seene. We now 

leave tbIa topic ID your IIaadI. II abonion moral! Shoald the lAue be 
'declded by the public? Wbea does life reaDy begiD? What about tbe 
woman's rights to have Control of her own body? In other words, 

A~roa:PToorCon? 

Con: A Matter of Compassion 
An argument about abortion should be an argument about compassion 

for human life. The question then arises : what is a human life and when 

Pro: The Issue is not "Potential for Life" but ... 
does it begin? . 

We know that from the moment of fertilization, there exists a complete 
cell which is quite aliye; witness the cellular growth within hours after 
fertilization. But is it distinct? Is this cell anything more than a part of the 
mother's body? I believe the central question in the abortion issue is: "Is the outlawing of all abortions a justifiable 

governmental act?" rather than the very 
misleading and often asked question : "When does 

fact that nothing in our prescnt law requires the 
preservation of entities which have the potendal for 
human life, the problem ari:;es of deciding when the 
potential for human life first exists. 

The sperm and ovwn obviously belong to those from whom they derive. 
But when they combine. there exists a different cell. something which is 
derived from two sources. And this cell, allowed to grow and develop will, 
in the normal course of events, become what we recognise as a unique 
human being. The logical conclusion is that, biologically-, it is unique from 
the point of conception. 

life begin?" 
It is generally agreed that all persons should have 

the right to do what they want as long as they don't 
harm other members of the society. Since an 
abortion doesn't directly harm any " being" other 
than the fetus, with abortion the question is: "In 
what sense can a fetus, before it can survive outside 
of its mother, be considered to be a member of 

If it exists a t conception, it seems that it certainly 
must exist a few seconds before conception actually 
occurs. And what about when a couple is alone in a 
room? (Being alone isn't actually required.) Cer-
tainly the potential exists for a new human life to 
result from such a situation. But is a couple which 
refrains from having sex for nine months to be 
condemned for the murder of a potential baby? 
Unless the religious view that God has proclaimed 
the potential for life to begin with conception i s 
adopted, I don't see how the potential for life 
argument can be used against abortion without also 
being used against any couple which doesn't 
produce a baby ev,:ry nine month.'!. 

But is it hwnan? After all, human beings are in some sense rational and 
social beings, whereas a fetus merely exists. I would argue, however, that 
the potential (or humanity is there. Only allow it time, and this individual 
will become humanized to its full potential. It must, then, be considered 
and treated as human. 

society?" 
The religious answer to this question seems to be 

that at some point during conception the sperm and 
the ovum acquire in the eyes of God the charac-
teristic we call buman life (which implies mem-
bership in the society) and so all abortion should be 
banned since in the eyes of God abortion is 

But then is it a person? A person is defined by his relationships in 
society; the active exercise of his humanity. By this definition the fetus is 
not a person and therefore not terribly important. 

But this means that we are placing achievement abouve potentiality. If 
we are to be consistent with this, then nobody would bother raising 
children, who have achieved nothing of consquence to society. The dif-
ference between a developing fetW3 and a small child (or a freshman at 
college) is only a difference in development of potentiality; they are not 
of a different kind. I must conclude that what is capable of being a person 
must be treated as a person, and not casually "disposed of" as an un-
welcome intruder. This is compassion for the weak and defensless, surely 

equivalent to murder. 
Anyone IS ot course entitled to hold this belief. I 

cannot see, however any justification for the formal 
adoption of this religious view by a supposedly non-
sectarian government. The process leading to the 
formation of a baby is a long and complicated 
sequence of events, and at what point in the 
sequence you choose to say that life "begins" is, I 
think, completely arbitrary and therefore 

In both cases a baby which could have come into 
existence has been prevented from doing so. 

I think the important stage in the sequence of 
events leading to a baby's birth is the stage at which 
a fetus can survive outside of its mother. It is at this 
point that the fetus can be considered to be a 
member of society independenUy of its mother, (its 
remaining in its mother simply being a matter of 
convenience. ) 

an idealto strive for. '.-
But what about the prospective mother, who may see abortion as a 

solution to a dilemma, perhaps in response to a rape? We must have 
compassion for her and the life which she wants to lead. She. too, is a 
person. I would say that if an uninterrupted pregnancy threatened the life 
of the mother, a physician would be justified in removing the fetus and 
thus preserving as much human life as he could. Perhaps also, in the case 
of rape, if the mother could not find it possible to consider this new in-
nocent as her own, if she felt that it would destroy her life as she knew it, 
abortion could be lÂ·ustified. 

irrelevant to the whole abortion issue. Thus governmental restrictions on what is done to 
the fetus after this point are completely justifiable. 
Before this point however, I don't see how govern-
mental interference in the affairs of a mother can 
be justified. _ Brian ORvis 

Sometimes it is said that the potential for life 
exists from the time of conception onwards and that 
once this potential exists, nothing should be done to 
stop the potential from being realized. Besides the 

Con: "A Life is a Very Precious Commodity" But what abOu convenience'!' Should one person's convenience out-weigh another's life? And should service to one life I1lin another? A great deal of compassion is needed here. I would recommend counseling as an 
option to abortion; recormnending adoption for instance. But each case is 
individual and should be decided by the woman and whoever she seeks 
counsel from. 

A child is such a precious and 
important part of our society. Why 
should we destroy the hope for the 
future? Each child, who is placed 
upon this earth by God, has the 
right to live his or her life to the 
fullest, as decreed by God. When I 
talk ahoot a chi\d being placed on 
earth, I mean that from the 
moment of conception that child is 
a living being and a part of our 

If we allow abortions on demand, 
we may be robbing ourselves of a 
child who has a cure for cancer or 
a solution for our starving world 
locked up inside his or her own 
mind. But, for sure, we will be 
missing the innocence and love of 
that "terminated" c'lild. 

I have heard many excuses for 
killing a child. One 0: these excuses 
is the right of a \I oinen to have 
control over her ~. But what 
about the right of hr-r fhild to live? 
Just because the child cannot 
speak, should we ignore his right:J? 
Because he can't !.cream out, " I

We, as mere mcrtpls, have no 
right to take the life ofIa child, born 
or unborn. Then, of t:a,Irse, there is 
the excuse that we aCe doing the 
child a favor by killihg him. Is it 
the child's fault that we have 
produced such a corrupt and 
hungry world? Why should he be 
punished for what we've done? The 
next step is not to kill the child, but 
to make sure that his life is a better 
one. 

Abortion on demand is in the 
same category of COJH>uts as 
suicid . Because we think we have 
an impossible task In front of W3, 

(Le. solving population growth and 
hunger, etc.) we turn to the 
bloodletting of a human life. Also 
because some women can't handle 
or just do not want the child, they 
show their inhumanity and hard-
ness by killing what is part or our 
world. Adoption agencies are filled 
with would-be parents, who want to 
love and care for a child, so no 
one can say that the child will not 
be loved by someone.

Revelle Reporter 

Will "Superweek" 
Affect Image? 

by Ran Anbar 
Opinion Editor 

One more new face has appeared 
on Rev~lle campus this year as 
Judith Edwin, straight from an 
administration post at Florida 
International University, takes 

Revelle Assistant Hesldent Dean 
Judith Edwin [TT photo , Bill 
Brooksl . 

over the Revelle Assistant 
Resident Dean post . Before 
initiating programs, Edwin plans 
to " find out what the students are 
like." In trying to achieve this 
goal, she will observe Revelle 
students during "Super-week," the 
tenth week of the qua rter. 

Perhaps the most incredible 
thing about Superweek, as it 
arrives just before finals, is that 
some Revelle students actually 
participate in it. Sponsored by the 

Revelle Program Board, Super-
week will include such activities as 
a fingerpainting contest, earthball 
games, a skateboard contest, a 
Guiness Book of World Records 
record breaking day, and a Friday 
noon concert on the plaza. 

The question is, will Revelle lose 
its title <i Nerdsville USA? 

Revelle College has been 
changing. The Community Center 
has been gaining momentum with 
its projects. Theme hCJIlses that 
pertain to such pursuits as gar-
dening, water sports, and 
language, have sprung up in some 
donns. Career workshops are 
operating all over the campus, and 
perhaps of some importance to 
Judith Edwin, there is a new 
Resident Dean's office. 

Edwin admits that she has been 
told "Revelle students are socially 
immature," and if found to be true, 
she feels that it will be her duty to 
help "correct the problem." 

" Through the mediwn of student 
activities we can increase social 
awareness," said Edwin. "There's 
a lot to gain outside of the 
academic world." 

Edwin has found her first week 
"hectic but enjoyable. to Most of her 
time has been spent organiiing and 
moving into her office, job, and 
apartment. Already she claims to 
love "the environment, the trees 
and the people." 

Perhaps more importantly, she 
even likes the "Revelle" at-
mosphere. " People are willing to 
help," she said. "They're quick to 
say 'hi' and even smile."

Semester ... 
they need more time in a course ... 

Throughout the Triton Times 
survey, most faculty agreed that a 
significant difference between the 
two systems is the pace at which a 
course progresses. For some 
faculty, this is a sufficient reason 
for a switch to semester, because 
now "if a person misses one or two 
lectures due to illness he misses too 
much." Others felt this is all part 
of college, and that students have 
to learn to adapt. "Those that can . 
keep up will be tomorrow's 
leaders. Those that can't, won't," 
one said. 

According to one professor, the 
most Significant argument against 
the quarter system is that there is 
" not enough time in a quarter to 
reflect on the course content". 
Learning in college, he said, will 
not come from the rote 
memorization of facts from books, 
but rather from the serious 
reflection about what the facts 
mean. There is not time for this in 
a ten-week course, he concluded.

"Cousin, Cousine" is 
French Crepe Comedy 

by Margaret Hewey 
aad Mark Stadler 

. without guilt. Two cousins by , 

Coulin, Coullne, generally 
speaking, is a French family ' 
circus, in which a horde of cousins 
meet en masse at marriages, 
funerals and parties. They get 
drunk, they try to have fun in 
diversions from the drudgery of 
everyday life. 

Specifically, Director Jean-
Charles Tacchella focuses his film 
on a sensuous affaire d'amour 

Boston :A 
Short But 
Sweet Show 

Friday night at Golden Hall, San 
Diegans were treated to one of the 
hottest new bands to come out for 
some time ... Boston. A new band 
from the city of Boston who have 
been taking the rock scene by 
storm. 

Led by the surprisingly com-
petent Tom Scholz, an MIT 
graduate with a masters degree in 
Mechanical Engineering, on lead 
guitar and Barry Goudreau on 
vocals, Boston put together a very 
satisfying though somewhat short 
set. 

Boston performed several tunes 
from their debut albwn including, 
" More Than A Feeling," " Piece of 
Mind", and "Smokin' ... 

Listeniitg to Boston, one hears 
fragments of the Doobie Brothers 
incorporated into their original 
music, but their own sound is quite 
distinctive if not particularly in-
novative. 

Boston shows promise of 
becoming a quite popular group 
providing they alleviate one 
problem: that of lead vocals. 
Barry Goudreau does a fine job, 
but his voice becomes slightly 
tiresome. The group needs some 
variety in local vocals and 
providing that they make some 
changes, Boston could go far. 

Opening the show, in place of 
scheduled Spirit, and barely worth 
mention, were an all girl group of 
teenage rockers from Los Angeles 
called The Runaways. Headed by 
eighteen-year-old Cheri Curry, The 
Runaways made a futile attempt at 
high energy, sexually suggestive 
rock and roll. Hindered by poor 
harmonies and a lack of basic 
musicianship. The Runaways are 
far from ready to play before a 
crowd of discerning rock fans. 

marriage, Marthe (Marie-
Christine Barrault) and Ludovic ' 
(Victor LanoUJ:) , meet at a wed-
ding and lightheartedly proceed to 
engage in a relationship. Both are 
married, both are free spirits. 

In fact, they resemble the 
children in the film, who are more 
aware of " adult matters" than are 
the adults. The children smile 
knowingly at the adult goings-on 
and are amused with their aHirs. 

As Francois TraHaut has said, 
" Children are in a state of grace." 
Marthe and Ludovic definitely are-
-they plunge into their romantic 
diversions with the innocence and 
poise of the very young. 

Throughout the film they indulge 
and splurge like small children : a 
visit to a patisserie to sate them-
selves with sweets and delicacies; 
playing hooky from their jobs to go 
swinuning ,leaving their spouses to 
make love in a hotel room, then 
tatooing each other with children's 
color pens and playfully washing 
each other clean in the bathtub; 
ducking their spouses at a wedding 
just for kicks; making love in a 
back bedroom during midnight 
mass at a family gathering. 

Through a reversion to 
childhood, Ludovic and Marthe 
rise above the tragedies of modern 
life, which haunt their other 
cousins and in the end flee on 
Ludovic's motorcycle, leaving 
family and responsibilities behind. 

Cousin, CousiDe is made to look 
even more romantic and cheerful 
by the use of sunny, light-drenched 
film shots. This is very apparent in 
a poolside shot with sunlight 
floating in behind Marthe and 
Ludovic, 

Absurd circus music sets the 
tone well, emphasizing the 
ridiculous quality of the gathering 
families. It also plays ' up the 
clownish drollness of the two 
lovers. 

Although the film is as thin and 
light as French crepes, it's a fun 
escape. Director Tacchella filters 
out all the guilt and consequences 
of Ludovic and Marthe's actions. 

The two heroes play their roles 
charmingly: Marie-Christine 
Bautrault is serene and Madonna-
like as Marthe, and Victor Lanoux 
is amusing and suave as Ludovic. 
Together they make a very sweet 
and sensuous couple. Their fling is 
the piece de resistance of Cousin 
Cousloe and leaves the viewer 
feeling satisfied and charmed. 

Cousin, CousiDe Is now playing at

Station To Station 
Don't be deterred by those snooty, high brow rock critics who happen to 

like Yes. You owe it to yourself toaee the Runaways. 
I'm sure you all know by now that the Runaways are a rock band 

comprised of five Los Angeles area nymphs; Ch-Cb-Ch-Ch-Cherie Currie 
on lead vocals, Uta Ford and Joan Jett on Guitars, Jackie Fox on Bass 
and Sandy West on drums. Are those names for real? 

Believe what you want to, but these girls were made to play rock and -
roll. As Currie says, "I've always loved mualc and singing. I've always 
wanted to be on stage. Being In front of an audience is exciting and 
fulfilling." But is it as exciting and fulfilling as her sex life? Only her 
manager knows for sure. 

At last Frida)16 soldo()ut Golden Hall performance (with headlining 
Boston) the Runaways demonstrated that they are indeed ~uch more 
effective in person than they are on disc. No big accomplishment you 
say? To that my retort is bunk. 

The Runaways 

These girls are 17 and 18 year olds, and they act~allr pl~y their own 
instruments in a very competent manner. Lead gUltaflSt Llta Ford has 
unquestionably been attending the Ritchie Blackmore sCh?01 of thun-
derous riffs while drummer Sandy West lays down a very solid backbeat. 
But the foc~l point of the Runaways stage show is Cherie. Curry, the hi.gh 
kicking, ass wiggling lead singer. Did you see that G,:strmg and the fish 
nets she wore during her anthem " Cherry Bomb? Now tell me how 
many 17 year olds you know who've been on stage under those cir-
cumstances? . 

But the key to the Runaways is their sexually oriented teenage musIc. 
The band's debut albwn, appropriately entitled "The Runaways," is f~ 
of it (sexual music; that is) . Lyrics like " I'm gettin' so hotn'm cookm' 
like anÂ· oven" and "have ya, grab ya "till y6u're sbre" do nothing to 
discourage their image as rock and roll's youngest prick teasers. 

Their description of themselves is best summed Ull in the sollJ{ "The 
Queens of NOise." As guitarist Joan Jett comments, " I s~rted out 
playing guitar to all my rock records because nobody thought girls could 
play rock. I've loved loud music since the first time I heard it." And 
while their music is very basic and repetitive, the Runaways are as 
much a legitimate rock band as say, Led Zeppelin. 

As Jett said from the stage of The Starwood, "We understand that there 
are some famous rock and rollers in the audience. Well, we just wanna let 
you know we're hot on your heels." 

.......... -..... . 

Rod Stewart's single, "Tonight's The Night," remains banned .on 
~u one of the most important AM radio chains in the country, despite 
Waro'er Brothers editing out the offending line, "spread your wings and 
let me come inside ... 

From London stewart told Rolling Stone : "The funniest thing about it 
. being banned is'that when the BBC.banned the sO!lg.1ast summer, I spid 

they'd never ban it in the States. I did put me foot In 1t. .. Well, not exac.tly 
me foot." The BBC actually okayed the tune for weekend and evenmg 
play and withdrew the partial ban when the song hit the top ten. . 

RKO President Dwight Case said: " I pulled it personally. The lYriCS 
were a litUetoo obvoiusfor me."

The III-starred Eighties 
(CPS)-If you think things are 

bad now, just wait until the next 
decade- it looks worse, a well-
known group of stargazers is 
warning. 

"A lot of astrologers are worried 
about the 1980s," says Robert 
Hand, a member of the National 
Council for Geocosmic Research. 
" We don't know what is going to 
happen." 

The problem, it seems, is that the 
planets are heading into an 

unusual alignment in 1980, that is 
similar to the alignment they were 
in during World War II. This 
alignment, which occurs every 20 
years, also bodes ill for presidents, 
since it is during this astro 
arrangement that the chief 
executives have been kicking the 
bucket in office. 

The . National Council for 
Geocosmic Research claims it is 

. trying to remove " mwnb&-jwnbo" 
from the ancient craft of astrology .

Women's Field H~key 
Forces Tie with Pomona 

By Dave Cobea 
Staff Writer 

UCSD field hockey is corning 
around. Tuesday, the Tritons had it 
out with Cal Poly Pomona, battling 
the visitors to a 1-1 tie. The Tritons, 
coming off a 10-0 thrashing of Point 
Lorna and a 2-2 tie with Mesa, 
played their best ball of the season 
in forc Ing the tie. 

Cal Poly led off quickly with a 
goal on a fifteen yard slap shot and 
appeared to be in control 
throughout the first half. Although 
most of the action transpired in the 
UC end of the field, the Tritons did 
not allow a goal. "The defense is 
really good, but the offense could 
hack us up a IitUe better," said 
':oach Lynn Gola at half time. 

Aggressive Play 
They got their back up in the 

person of Amy Cheshire whose 
aggressive play paid off in a 
second half goal, tying the game at 
1-1. 

From this point on neither ofÂ· 
fense could generate anything else 
as the defenses took over. Kathy 
Connors was excellent in guarding 
the Triton goal, blocking many 
shots which would have won the 
game for Gal Poly. The Tritons 
successfully checked the Cal ofÂ· 
fense at midÂ·field for the 
remainder of the game as the tide 
of the game switched in UCSDs 
favor. 

But' time ran out as neither team 
could tally a score. The Triton 
defense played well, in checking 
Cal., as did the offense in scoring 
the tying goal. 

The season is winding to a close 
for the field hockey team, a team 
which has shown immense im-
provement over the course of the 
season. They play their last home 
game on Nov . 18th against 
Palomar. 

Cross Country Places Sixth 
At District Championship 

The UCSD cross country team has proven once and for all that it can 
compete in the tough NAJA district 111. 

In the championship meet held last Saturday in La Mirada, the Tritons 
finished sixth out of a total of fourteen teams, putting together their best 
efr ort of the season. 

Doug Jacobson aga in finished in top position for the Tritons. His time 
of 27 minutes and 4i seconds was not good enough to place him on the allÂ· 
District team yet was enough for twenty seventh place overall. 

Team Efforl 
Alan Bernath was next to hit the tape [or the Tritons. He finished in 

t hirty fourth place overall with a time of 28 ;24. Following close behind 
were Kevin Young (28: 47-38th place), Jon Halperin (29 ;0:>-4Oth place) and 
Chris Pritchard (29; 41-47th place ). Non scoring finishers for UCSD were 
Danny Ugale (29 :52) and Ron Bourret (36 ;10) . 

It was a team effort for the Tritons. Halperin , Pritchard and Ugale all 
ran their best times of the season. In fact, it was Halperin's effort that 
secured s ixth place for UCSD. He improved his time by 40 seconWl which 
placed him high enough to edge out Cal Lutheran's third man. The 
margin separating sixth place San Diego and seventh place Cal Lutheran 
was a slim three points . 

The Distric t meet marks the closing of the 1976 cross country season 
and the beginning of the 1976-77 track season. Coach Andy Skief held the 
fi rst track and field meeting Thursday.
