CALPIRG blatnes 
publishers for prices 

Andrew Mo/Guardian 
Book report: A new study conducted by the UCSD chapter of CALPIRG found that 
textbook prices have increased at a rate four times higher than that of inflation. 

By PATRICK AUEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Textbook prices have risen at a 
rate four times higher than inflation 
over the past four years, partly as a 
result of aggressive marketing tactics 
by publishers, the California Public 
Interest Research Group announced 
in a new report released on Feb. 1. 

T he study was the second in 
two years prepared by the group. 

"Textbook publishers rip off stu-
dents by using gimmicks to artificial-
ly inflate prices, and higher educa-
tion is made less affordable as a 
result," said Derlin Hsu, coordinator 
of VCSD CALPIRG's "Affordable 
lbtbooks Campaign." 

The report, titled "Ripoff 101 : 
2nd Edition," outlines a study con-
dtJcted by CALPIRG that exam-
ines the prices of the most com-
monly used textbooks at 59 univer-
sities across the U nj ted States. The 
average student at a university will 
pay $900 per year on textbooks, 
almost one-fifth of the in-state 
ntition for a four-year public uni-
versity, according to the study. 

In addition, CALPIRG accused 
textbook publishers of bundling 
books with superfluous materials 
and releasing unnecessary new edi-
tions of the books in order to 
inflate prices. 

"Publishers increase textbook 
prices by adding unnecessary bells 
and whjstles, such as CD-ROMs or 
workbooks," Hsu said. "Bundled 
books are, on average, 10 percent 

more expensive than their unbun-
dled versions and ... 50 percent of 
all bundled books surveyed did not 
have an accompanied unbundled 
versjon on the shelf. Furthermore, 
65 percent of faculty surveyed said 
they use these additional items 
rarely or never." 

In a written statement released 
on the same day to refute the 
report, Association of American 
Publ ishers President and CEO Pat 
Schroeder said that the bundled 
versions offer multimedia learning 
that is helpful to students. 

"These textbooks are supported 
by an extensive array of supplemen-
tal materials, such as study guides, 
lab manuals and digital media like 
CD-ROMs, online tutorials, self-
assessments and digital libraries," 
Schroeder said. "These are 2lst-
century tools used to prepare snt-
dents to succeed in today's world." 

Hsu cited the new edition of 
math textbook "Calculus: Early 
Transcendentals" that is used at 
UCSD and published by Thomson 
Learning as 3n example of an 
un necessary update. The fifth edi-
tion of the book, which sells for 
$13 0, only varies slightly from the 
1999 edition, which can be bought 
used for between $10 and $100, 
according to Hsu. 

"The only signi ficant difference 
between these two books is the 
price," Hsu said. "Thomson 
Learning charges American stu-

University may request delay 
in U-House funds deadline 
By CHRlmNE CLARK 

Staff Writer 

With just one month left 
before a university-imposed cut-
off date to raise the $7.2 million in 
private money necessary to 
rebuild the chancellor's residence, 
ca mpus adminjstrators may ask 
the UC Office of the Pre ident for 
an extension, according to Vice 
Chancellor of External Affairs 
James M. Langley. 

The fund raising deadline for 
rebuilding the Vniversity House 
is approachjng and IIltmber of 
the building advisory committee 
that got together to over ee the 
project arc sti ll actively raising 
funds, according to Langley. 

"I have found it to be the case 
that these projects usually go 
down to the wire, " Langley said . 
"The best-case scenario would be 
to have a single donor pay for the 
whole project." 

The committee is currently in 
talks with potential contributors, 
according to Langley. 

"There is no science to it," 
Langley said. "We are approach-
ing private donors and address-
ing their concerns, but a project 

like this usually takes up to 18 
months, and we have had a con-
siderably shorter time period . 
We mjght ask VCOP for a brief 
extension. " 

For the first time, VCOP has 
also recently said that it may pro-
vide a portion of the necessary 
funds if the university falls short of 
its goal. 

"The vast majority of the fund-
ing is expected to come from pri-
vate donors," UCOP 

ommunications Director Brad 
Hayward said. "VCOP will pro-
vide a small portion. We were 
talking about $1 million, but we 
have not committed to a set 
amount." 

In an interview with the 
Guardian last week, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes had said that the 
office would rely solely on the 
money raised by the campus. 

"I've said 'no' so far," Dynes 
said, when asked whether VCOP 
would provide any money for the 
project. "That's local and they've 
got to raise that money locally." 

A report, commissioned by 
Dynes soon after he became VC 
president, and released last sum-
mer, found the house uninhabit-

able. 
"There was an anthropological 

and forensic report commi sioned 
by VCOP," anthropology profes-
sor and committee member 
Donald Tuzin said. "There were 
serious seismic problems. The 
place was a dump. No one wanted 
to sleep there." 

A private residence for the 
chancellor, University I louse also 

. serve as a venue for university 
events. 

After the report, U OP 
appointed a committee to look 
into po sible options for recon -
structing the building. 

"We decided to demolish the 
existing house and rebuild a new 
house on the S3111e property," 
Tuzin said. "UCOP accepted the 
proposal." 

For the duration f the project, 
which could take up to two years 
to complete, the university will 
rent a $6,500-per-month resi-
dence for Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox. 

If there are not enough private 
funds raised by the end of the 
month, the committee will explore

Watson alters RIMAe oversight 
BAC violated campus policy, Pae says 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

Since RlMAC Arena's opening 
10 yea rs ago, the committee in 
charge of its oversight has been in 
violation of campu policies 
because of inadequate student 
representation, according to A.S. 
President Jcnn Pae. 

Vndcr th e cam pus Student 
Conduct Code, building advisory 
committees "shall be comprise!;! of 
a majority of students as voti ng 
members" for facilities funded by 
sntdent fees . 

However, only recently have 
university admi nistrators taken 
steps to comply with the policy, 
according to Pae. At her request, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W Watson changed the 
makeup of the RIMAC Building 
Advisory Committee to include a 
voting student majority, she said. 

"She pointed out to us some of 
the issues and concerns here, and 
she was absolutely righti" Watson 
said. "We're malcing the 
changes." 

Students voted to approve self-
assessed fees to pay for the con-
struction and operation of 
RIMAC in 1990. Currently, stu-
dents pay $92 per quarter in those 
fees - the third-highest charge 
after tuition and registration fees .

Student strength: Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson recently 
changed the RIMAC Building Advisory Committee to include a voting student majority. 

"Before, it wasn't the students' 
role to pay for facilities and build -
ings on campus," Pae said. "As the 
budget gets tighter and tighter, 
students start paying for things 
they really shouldn 't be." 

In particular, Pae said she was 
concerned about expansion for the 
complex approved by the commjt-
tee prior to the members hip 
changes. 

RIMAC has planned to add an 
annex building, which will break 
ground in the summer and i 
planned to open by fa ll 2006, 

according to Director of Spons 
Facilities Don C hadwick. The 
10,OOO-squarc-foot building will 
be located in North Campus and 
will contai n two sntdent lounges, 
a conveni ence store, a meeting 
room and a Sports-themed cafe.

I BRIEFLY 
Study: Hi,lh schools fail to 

teach Farst Amendment 
Almost half of high school students believe 

newspapers should not publish stories without 
government approval, the largest-ever sUNey 
of student First Amendment sentiment has 
found. 

Paid for by the John S. and James L Knight 
Foundation, the sUNey questioned more than 
100,000 high school students across the nation, 
at least a third of whom said they believe the First 
Amendment goes too far in the rights ~ guaran-
tees. 

Much of this sentiment is the result of poor 
or inadequate instruction at schools about the 
importance of the Bill of Rights and its role in 
society, the report stated. 

"The study suggests that First Amendment 
values can be taught - that the more students 
are exposed to news media and to the First 
Amendment the greater their understanding of 
the rights of Amencan citizens: it stated. "But it 
also shows that basics about the First 
Amendment are not being tauRht that 75 per-
cent of students sUNeyed thin~ flag buming is 
illegal, that nearly 50 percent believe the gov-
ernment can censor the Intemet, and that 
many students do not think newspapers 
should publish freely~ 

Students who write for school papers posted 
better knowledge of the subjects, it found. 

"These results are not only disturbing. they 
are dangerous: Knight Foundation President 
and CEO Hodding Carter III said. "Ignorance 
about the basics of this society is a danger to 
our nation's future." 

Education Deparbnent late 
in updating data, GAO says 

An investigation by the Government 
Accountability Office has faulted the methods 
used by the Department of Education to annu-
ally update the tax tables used in detemnining 
financial aid. 

Had the Education Department acted in 
2004-05 to include updated tax information 
from individual states in the formulas used for 
aid calculations, the government would have 
saved $290 mill ion, the agency's report stated. 

The release of the report came less than a 
month after the department moved to update 
the tax infomnation'to use in 2005-06. The deci-
sion has been criticized by student and education 
groups because it will cut down the number of 
students receiving Pell Grants by almost 90,000. 

In previous years, the department relied on 
1988 tax data, when taxes in most states were 
higher, causing its calculations io overestimate 
student need.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, fEBRUARY], 2005 

Though the Department of Education must 
update Its tax tables annually, it had not 
attempted to use new tax infomnation between 
1993 and 2003, the GAO found and in 2003, 
the update was suspended. 

Part of the problem was that the depart-
ment relied exclusively on data maintained by 
the Intemal Revenue Service and did not try to 
find altemate sources, the report stated. 

Spellings sworn in to head 
Department of Education 
In a public ceremony at the Department of 

Education, Margaret Spellings was swom in as 
the new Secretary of Education on Jan. 31. 

In his introduction, President George W. 
Bush said Spellings would work to increase the 
maximum Pell Grant and expand access to 
community colleges. 

"Margaret understands we need to make 
higher education more affordable and accessi-
ble for all Americans: he said. 'We will reform 
the student aid system and inCfF~ase college 
assistance for lOW-Income students." 

Many of San Diego's . 
mentallY ill living on street 

Fifteen percent of mental~ in people in San 
Diego County may be homeless, UCSD· 
researchers repoIted in a February study. 

Appearing in the American Journal of 
Psychiatry, the study suggests that the number 
may be reduced or prevented through pro-
grams treating substance abuse and public-
funded health benefits. 

Nthough between one-fourth and one-third 
of homeless persons are estimated to be men-
tal~ ill, the report is one of the first to describe 
how many of the mentally ill are homeless. 

New lanpage may indicate 
foundations of grammar 
A new sign language created in a small 

Israeli village may hola crucial insights into 
understanding the roots of human grammar, a 
campus professor believes. 

In a linguistic analysis of a natural~ arising 
language, communications professor Carol 
Padden and a group of researchers have studied 
a new altemative sign language used in a com-
munity of about 3,500 deaf and hearing people. 

'Because [the language) developed inde-
pendently, it may refiect fundamental proper-
ties of language in general and provide insight 
into basic questions about the way in which 
human language develops from the very 
beginning," Padden said.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting .19 - Feb. 2, 2005 

Reports 
Interfraternity Council Representative 
Harry Khanna 

Khanna reported that the Systemwide 
Legal File-Sharing Committee is currently 
discussing possible ways to bring legal file-
sharing programs to UCSD. The commit-
tee will meet different vendors and may hire 
one vendor to provide the service to stu-
dents for a small fee. 

Council Caucus 
Councilmembers discussed the current 

system of representation used to elect sena-
tors to the A.S. Council. Currendy, all 24 
senators are accountable to the college that 
they represent. PresidentJenn Pae proposed 
a system in which half of the 24 senators 
would be elected as college senators and the 
other 12 would be elected through a cam-
puswide at-large election. 

Many members of the council supported 
the idea of reducing the number of college 
senators on the council. Others, however, 
said that they believe the change would make 

the council less representative of the campus. 

Old Business 
ItemD 

The council passed a resolution in oppo-
sition to SB 5, the state Senate bill that 
would direct UC regents to develop and 
implement a set of guidelines requiring 
instructors to provide opposing viewpoints 
in their classrooms. Some members of the 
council initially supported an equal 
approach for university curricula. 

John Muir College Junior Senator Neil 
Spears said that the bill would mandate that a 
class on the history of the Holocaust include 
readings questioning whether the genocide 
took place. The council passed the resolution 
in opposition to the bill by a vote of 20-1-0.

new editions, publisher survey says 

continued from page I 
dents S 130 for this booIc., but they charge 
students in other countries onJy 572 . That's 
just a big rip-off." 

Revelle College Provost and math pro-
fessor Daniel Wulbert, who spoke at the 
CALPIRG press conference where the new 
report was first revealed, said he reaffirmed 
the study's findings. As a professor for 30 
years, Wulbert said he has rarely seen a new 
edition with any significant changes. 

"When a book comes out for the first 
time, a second edition is warranted because 
thp.y rethink the difficulty and the order, as 
well as get feedback," Wulbert said. "Then 
they are able to improve the book. After 
that, the changes in edition have less value." 

Wulbert also said that the faculty at the 
UCSD mathematics department did not see 
a reason to switch from the third to the 
fourth edition of "Early Transcendentals" 
but was forced to do so when the publisher 
infonned him that no copies of the older 
edition were available. 

"nne faculty] didn't want the copies," 
Wulbert said. "The students didn't want the 
copies. The onJy one who seemed to want 

the new copies of the book was the publish-
ing company." 

In response to the report, the AAP cited 
a survey of 1,029 instructOrs conducted by 
Zogby International in December 2004 . 
According to the poll, 75 percent of the fac-
ulty surveyed either require or recommend 
the supplemental materials found in the 
bundles. The survey also found that 62 per-
cent of the faculty prefers editions with the 
most recent copyright date. 

Schroeder also addressed the issuc of 
price discrepancies between textbooks in 
the United States and overseas. 

"In England, where tllition can be 20 
percent of that at a comparable U.S. institu-
tion, textbook pri.ces must follow suit if they 
are to compete WIth pnces set by indigenous 
publishing programs," Schroeder stated. 
"Setting prices according to regional condi-
tions helps ensure access to quality educa-
tional materials for many more students, and 
holds down the price of U.S. textbooks 
because costs can be spread further."

University ignores 
laws, student safety 

Students who dine on campus are in for a rude awakening: The 
very uni ve rsity agency 
des igned to enforce health 
laws continues to operate 
with impunity, doing 
more to protect food ven-
dors th an consumers. 

A yea r ago, th e 
Guardian expo cd wide-
spread violations by cam-
pus ea teries of a state law 
requiring vendors to have 
th e facilities' health 
inspection reports on 
han d and to alert cus-
tomers of their right to 
review the reports. 

To thi day, these 
wholesale violations con-
tinue, and the university's 
Environment, Health and 

a fety D epartment serves 
as a knowing accomplice. 

In most localities, law 
enforce ment and restau-
rant in pections are con-
ducted by a neutra l county 
agency. . 

This, however, is not 
true of the university. 
Instead , the fox is guard-
ing the chicke n coop: On 
one hand, the university 

lea es facili ties to vendors, 
u on the other, it also 

bea rs the responsibi lity of 
inspecting them. 

The consequence of 
this conflict of interes t 
became clear this fall, 
when the department 
chose to suppress from the 
public the low scores of 
ca mpus eateries under an 
upd a ted inspection 
method, despi te state law 
defining the reports as 
public records. 

According to the 
department's specialist 
Bruce Bowers, his agency 
would wait until vendor 
raised their scores to pub-
licly release their grades. 

Consumers should not 
be forced to rely on a stu-
dent paper using the 
California Public Records 
Act to gain access to 
records originally 
designed for their use. 
The job of a health agency 
is to enforce health codes 
and provide information 
to the public; in both 
cases, the Environment,

Morality misplaced in 
newest stem cell debate 
Proving the effective-ness of embryonic stem cells requ ires 
time and research, as 
Ca liforn ians who voted in 
support of Proposition 71 
in ovember recognize. 
However, their effor ts 
no w appear fruitl ess with 
the recent discove ry that 
all stem cell lines available 
for study are contaminat-
ed. 

While th ere is no ques-
tion that this di sturbing 
discove ry made by 
UCSD School of 
,\ Iedici ne and Salk 
fn stitute cienti t S - will 
cnuse much rethinkin g 
and man y setbacks in 
future research, it does not 
mean that all tern cell 
work has to stop . 

Contin uin g re ea rch 

should not be a question 
of morality, as critics like 
the Coalition of 
Americans for Research 
Ethics are trying to frame 
it, but rather one of con-
sis tency. 

If there was a ct!rtain 
level of federal funding 
and local support for stem 
cell research before the 
discovery of contami nants, 
there should be that sa me 
degree of upport now. 

Pres ident George W. 
Bush should lift restric-
tions on federal funding 
for stem cell resea rch and 
expand his policy - if not 
reverse it completely - to 
allow th e snl dy of at least 
some exis ting, conceivably 
unco ntaminated lines that

Student apathy a byproduct 
of laziness and pessimism 

By BRYAN TSAG 
Opinion Editor 

A.S. Council ca ndidates, student media outlets 
and students in general oFten decry the lack of things 
to do in La Jolla and bemoan the campus' poor 
social atmosphere. As a result, Friday afternoons 
hring the weekly evacuation of UCSD's SoCal 
natives, with holidays like Martin Luther King Jr-
Day making the exodus particularly acute. But at 
what point does the student apathy mindset become 
less of a campus issue and more of a 
self-fulfilling prophecy? After all, 
despite the complete and utter lack of 

" 

Mass., and Amherst, Mass., are in place where it 
snows about six months of the year - making wild 
parties a little difficult - and where, instead of 
things around campus being too expensive, there 
isn't anything around campus besides cows and pas-
ture. A bigger problem on this campus may be the 
large numher of students from nearby Los Angel es. 
Once freshmen get here and college doesn't immedi -
ately live up to their expectations, it's easy to go 
home on the weekends. 

Parr of th e problem is unrealistic expectations 

things to do on campus, there seem to 
be no lack of busy, sleep-deprived stu-
dents who always appear to be rushing 
from one thing to another. 

After all, how can 

about college; what high school 
se nior doesn't want to believe that 
he or she is headed for partics wirh 
hot, slu tty people, classes full of 
smart, witty people or a chance to 
do whatever he or she wants away 
from parental supervision? If 
you 're not getting enough out of 
your college experience, it's always 
easier to blame the college th~n 
y urself. 

T he truth is, for many students, the 
alleged dearth of fun things to do is as 
much the result of attitude as anything 
else. After all, how can one expect to 
become integrated into the campus 
social network if one spends weekends 
in Orange County' For those who do 
stay, weekends : cgu larly bring over-
flowing parties from Pacific Beach to 
Mira Mesa, opportunities to barbecue 
on the beach (in January, no less), 

one expect to 
become integrated 
into the campus 

social network if one 
spends weekends in 
Orange County?" 

No matter where YOIl are, to be 
happy you'rc goi ng to have to get 
involved in something you like, 
whether it's going to parties, join-
ing the student government, going 
Greek, doing a show for campus 

more poker games than you'll see on "Ti lt" and 
unday afternoon football gatheri ngs. It just takes 

time to develop the rclationshi ps and groups of 
friends that make it possible to get that party invita-
tion or pull together a regular poker game. 

Sure, La Jolla isn't the idea l pl~ce to have a uni-
versity. Many of the things arouna La Jolla are too 
pricey for public school students and local orcli -
nances make raucous parties on or right next to calll-
pu a rarity. BIIt that doesn't mean students shouldn 't 
be responsi ble for their own fun instead of waiting 
for fun to come to them. After all, many of the 
alleged best coll ege towns, such as Williamstown, 

television, hitting up the world-
class restaurants around La]olla, gOing to the beach , 
gambling at Indian casi nos or smoking it up 
(Hooka h, of course). If UCSD was located on the 
corner of Broadway and Fifth Avenue in New York 
City and all one did was complain and play 
~ounterstrike, it probably wouldn 't make for a good 
lime. 

So instead of turning toward a football tea m or 
more money for concerts as a way to improve the 
quality of student li fe, maybe this year's A.S. Counci l 
candidates can instead encourage sOldents to sti ck 
around and take advantage of what is around them 
before asking for more. 

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, Z005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

UCSD myths do a disservice to students 
the watts 
report 

Daniel Watts 
"Ever hear the one about 

GeiseP" 
Apparently, the con-

crete suppOrt arms that surround 
the main section were an after-
thought, necessary to sustain the 
building'S structural integrity after 
the architect "forgot" to include 
the weight of the books in the 
origina l design_ It's sinking, too. 

Or so goes the myth, first men-
tioned long ago by some intrepid 
UCSD student and since spread 
by word of mouth . 

There's also the one about the 
Sun God statue: Make a wish as 
you walk beneath its arch, and it 
will come true. This myth is a bit 
less well known. I've been here 
four years and have yet to see 
someone make a wish. Nor have I 
heard this myth spread by anyone 
not employed by the university. 

There are myths about UCSD, 
and then there is misinformation 
- a blatant disregard for the 

truth. 
This columnist's audit of three 

specific campus tours on Jan . 25 , 
Jan. 26 and Jan . 27 revealed mis-
information being spread by some 
of UCSD's College Ambassadors 
- a euphemism for "campus tour 
guides." 

Other than the library, 
UCSD's most recognizable sym-
bols are arguably the Koala, the 
Sun God and the Triton. Only the 
Triton escaped the clutches of 
inventive tour guides. 

When Koala members along 
the tour route respectfu lIy offered 
their newspaper to passersby, a 
few tour members grabbed copies. 
The tour guide that day immedi-
ately ca lled out, "That paper has 
nothing to do with UCSD. It 
receives no funding from the 
school, the people who run it have 
nothing to do with us." He then 
showed the official tudent news-
paper: the UCSD Guardian. The 
difference between the two, he 
said, was that the student govern-
ment funds the Guardian (it actu-
ally does not), and it does not fund 
the Koala (it really does). 

The guide mangled the Sun 
God festival, too. The uS2 million 
festival" (actually less than 
$200,000) was funded entirely by 

the university (actually funded by 
the A.S. Council), according to 
Andrew. 

According to another tour 
gujde, the university named Price 

" ... [G Jiving incorrect 
infarmatian about 

academic requirements is 
probably the worst offense 

a representative of the 
university can commit. 

... They each cited wildly 
varying G E requirements 
for each college, showing 
a lack of uniformity even 
in their incompetence. " 

Center after Sol Price, the woman 
who founded Costeo. It is the cen-
tral gathering place for UCSD's 
15,000 undergraduates, many of 
whom have classes in Peterson 

Hall, named after Jack in the Box 
founder J ack Peterson . UCSD's 
dwn on-campus fire station pro-
tects these buildings. New bui ld-
ings under construction in the 
Student Center expansion will 
include an "i nternational market 
and grill." 

Speakjng of international , 
UCSD evidently has an "interna-
tional school " and multiple 
"i nternational centers" spread 
throughout the campus. 

Not quite. 
Sol Price was a man, and he 

founded Price C lub, not Costeo. 
There are 20,210 undergraduates 
as of winter 2005, the founder of 
J ack in the Box is named Robert 
and there is no on-campus fire 
station. 

Student Center will not have 
an "international market and 
grill," whatever that means . 
Neither does UCSD have an 
international school (the closest 
thing is the Graduate School of 
International Relations and 
Pacific Studies). Although UCSD 
sends hundreds of its students 
abroad, there is only one 
International Center on campus 
- and that's more than many 
other schools.

ents and students on t he tour not 
only to a deluge of false informa-
tion about the campus, but grant-
ed an interesting take on the col-
lege sy tem as well. 

This columnist's home is E~l rI 
Warren College, whi ch one 
ambassador described as havi ng 
" no well - round ed ness" and 
"straightforward ohjcctives." Ir's a 
"career-oriented" college, he aid, 
with minimal general ed uca tion 
requirements - all of which must 
be in the same relative field as the 
student's major. 

Another tOur guide had appar-
entl y never even been to Warren . 
When asked to point . it out, he 
stood at the edge of Warren Mall 
a:ld actually gestured toward a 
path that, if followed, would lead 
the wayward student through an 
ecological prese rve , then to 
Interstate 5. 

She also claimed that Warren 
required an academic intern hip 
as part of its general education, 
and that its philosophy was 
"bridging the gap between indus-
try and education." 

All of that is wrong. 
Cataloguing the e tOur guides' 

transgressions may see m nitpicky, 
but giving incorrect information 
about academic requirements is 
probably the worst offense a rep-
resentative of the university ca n 
commit. \Nh at eparates each col-
lege is a different theme ami sepa-
rate GE requirement , both of 
which these tour guides mangled. 
T h ey each ci ted wildly varying 
GE requirements fo r eac h college, 
showing a lac k of uniformi ty even 
in their incompetence. T his mis-
information does a dis ervicc to 
the new admits and their parents, 
some of whom wcre actually tak-
ing notes during the tour. 

Assuming guide undergo the 
same training, or at least read the 
same campus welcome brochure, 
there is no real excuse for such 
varied descriptions of the ca illpus. 
Of course, there are competent 
tour guid es as well. Among them 
are se niors who have been 
involved in campus li fe for their 
entire academic careers and kn ow 
the campus inside and o ut. It's a 
sha me that all of them aren't lik 
that.

The price of becoming a champion 
Geoffrey Rush dives deliciously into 

the deep end in ISwimming Upstream' 
By MARISA GUTIERREZ 

Contributing Writer 

Get on your marks! . [t's time to dive into the deep end. While the bottom of the pool may be filled with mire, the 
sparkle at the top is undeniable. Poignant 
and powerful, "Swimming Upstream" .is a 
remarkable piece of ustralian filmmaking . 
This Australian-Arne ican coproduction , 
superbly directed by Russell Mulcahy 
(" H ighlander"), is based on the true story 
of 19 50s Bri sbane swimming champ 
Anthony Fingleton, whose gripping ta!e 
chronicles hi s iron will to pursue a dream m 
spi te of the countless obstacles that arise 
fr om livin g in a dysfunctional Austrahan 
family. 

Mulcahy'S drama centers on you~g To~y 
Fingleto n 's (J esse Spence r) relatIOnshIp 
with his distant father, Harold (G eoffrey 
Rush), an d the dedication it took Tony to 
win his father's respect . Born into a large 
family and convinced by his father that he 
wi ll never amount to the achievements of 
h is brothers, To ny attempts to win h is 
fa ther's respect by becoming a champion 
swimmer. In his bes t effons to pl ease hIS 
fat her, l o ny begi ns to realize h is own self-
worth in the process. pencer (fo rmerly of 
t he Aussie soap .. e ighbours") certainly 
ri ses to the chall enge as the tormented 
l o ny wh ile T im Draxi (John Fingleton) com~lements Spencer 's performan ce nice ly

competing brother caught l>etween loya lty

extraordinary as the damaged, harsh alco-
holic father with a violent streak. With the 
thorny father-son relationship at the core 
of the film, "Swimming UpStream" has ~t­
tingly been called '''Shine ' in the swiJ:t1mmg 
pool," a testament to Rush's bri ll iance as a.n 
actor who manages to insti ll some humam-
ty and appeal into his troubled character. 

Judy Davis' understated performance as 
the silently suffering wife brings the film's 
most moving moments. The scenes shared 
between Davis and Spencer are where 
"Swimming Upstream" particularly excels. 
They are qu ite beautiful ~ nd breathe some 
depth into what could have amounted to a 
fairly stra ightforward sports film . 

M ulcahy's uncanny abi lity to unra vel 
this honest narrative, coupled Wi th Mart lll 
McGrath 's brilliant cin ematography, make 
uSwimming U pstream " a th o ro ughly 
appealing and engaging film tha t actuall y 
immerses the audience in to the life of Tony 
Fingleton. We become part of the fami ly as 
we share rare monients of calm, contras ted 
with agoni zin g sce nes of domestic violence. 
T hen we are in the pool, above and below 
the waterl ine, as Tony and Joh n train , win 
and polish th eir trophies. . 

The diverse and in telligently executed 
ca mera an gles are what effect ively bridge 
the gap between the a udie ~ce an d the 
movie screen. Take the sho t (fr om the hot-
10m of th e pool) wh en an Australian penny 
hOI'crs in the wa ter before it sinks to the 
bottom. Or the extraordi nary scene when 
the lwliness of a d runken , vio lent alterca-
ti on i: vie wed through a spi lt pudd le 0 beer 
on the fl oor. The swimming cquence. 
wi th th eir spl it screens, are th ri Jl i~g, and 
while Il arold is wi ll ing J ohn to WIn , our 
heans are with Tony. 

U ltim ate ly, "Swi m min g U pstream" is 
very genuine in its intent. an d authentic. in 
its execution. It·s an uplifti ng story, WIth 
Tony never wavering from his dream, .for 
which swimming is his ticket. An absorbmg 
and haunting fil m, "Swi m mi ng U pstream" 
is an outright winner.

Cieto Boys 
The Foundation 

Rap-A-Lot 

***l 
WARNl G : This album is probably way roo hard for 
you. If your familiarity 
with the Geto Boys ends 
witlt the "Feels Good to be 
a Gangs ta" montage in 
UCSD graduate Mike 
J udge 's "Office Space," 
then you might be slightly 
out of your element. But if 
you're in the mood for 
some unapologetic 
Southern gangsta rap, then 
this is the CD for you. 

Scarface, Willy D and 
Bushwick Bill have reunit-
ed for the fi rst time si nce 

1996 to crea te The 
Foundation, and while 
many come-back albums 
have failed in hip-hop, the 
Geto Boys have not disap-
pointed. T hey have made 
no attempt to change 
their style or attitude, 
producing a CD reminis-
cent of the mid-'90s. This 
trio from H ouston isn't 
for everybody, and if vio-
lence and misogyny 
offend you, you might just 
want to wai t for the next 
Armosphere CD. 

"Keeping it real" is an 
abstract concept often dis-
cussed in hip-hop, and it is 
refre hing to listen to a CD 
that does just that. This is a 
strong album all the way 
through , and it accom-
plishes this without the 
stereotypical elements 
found on evety rap album 
these days (materialism, 
skitS, the obligatoty Kanye 
andlor LiP Jon track). 

True fans can rejoice; 
the Gero Boys have kept it 
real, and it is defi nite ly 
worth the wait.

sets the stage for a dramat-
ic entrance fo r the rest of

However, Trail of Dead 
fail miserably. T he remain-

forced, confusing song full 
of unnecessary screaming 
and incredibly mundane 
gui tar riffs. 

Poor Conrad Keely -
he sounds like a Beatles

Great potentia l is hidden 
under the forced songs, 
but none of the songs

it. The only redeemable 
song throughout th e 
whole of Worlds IIpQl'f is 
"Will You Smile Again'" 
The melody is hartno-

match Keely' si nging. 
Unfortunately, Trail o f 
Dead hit it right on the 
SpOt in titling this track 
because you definitely will 
not be smiling again for 
the rest of the 31 bum.

UCSD theatre department students 
put a dark spin on 'As You Like It' 

The classic gender-bending Shakespeare 
play comes to the Mandel Weiss Forum 

By ANIA DYLEWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCS D theatre and dance department's production of 
, ,villiam Shakespeare's " As You 

Like h I! opens at the Mandell Weiss 
Forum on Feb.3 . The humorous 
spectacle is much more than JUSt a 
cOllventional stock comedy about 
mistaken identity, gender-bending, 
I11U ic and slapstick, and it's nor evCll 
set in Elizabethan England . 

"'vVc used a~ our touchstolle the 
'305 in France between tl1e war 
because J was really interested in 
what was goi ng on il; that time eco-
nomically, but also politically," said 
Larissa Kokernot, director and 
third-year Master of Fine ArtS can-
didate in the directing program. She 
explained that the aggressive paci-
ti 111 adopted by France after World

orher seasons and happening at 
Arden," Kokernot said . She 
received help from Jim Will.ker, a 
classic text specialist in the theatre 
department. 

The set is abstract, unobtrusive 
and simple. The background eon-
t;lins vertical colull1JlS made of fab-
ric, which represent the bark of 
trees, and a platform wi th a grid in 
the shape of tree branches attached 
to the top of it. A circular disk ros-
m lm covered in white sheetS serves 
as the inside of the court. After act 
one, the sheets come off and the set 
creatively transforms into a vibrant 
forest . 

"[The play] is very cyclical," 
Kokernot said. " It ends in marriage, 
but it's very much about the cycles 
of love and of life, and the kind of 
bigger picnlre of that. So where 
sound and ligh tS will fit in is to help 
liS track that journey through tl1e 
season> starti ng in ,vinrer and at the 
very end, during Rosa lind 's epi-
logue, when lcaves arc falling and 
it's autu lnn." 

The intri nsic darkness that 
comes through in the play effective-
ly adds a realistic context for tl1e 
comedy, making the pl ay more 
accessible and givi ng the characters 
a human dimension. The cast of 
MFA srudcntS and undergrads gi e 
poignant and stimulating portrayals. 
By tapping into lucid emotions, 
Shakespeare's words are more com-
prehensible and moving. 

The play runs Feb. 3 through 
Feb. 12 from T hursday to Saturday 
at 8 p.m. with an additional matinee 
performance on Feb. 5 at Z p.m.

Joe: Belichick's leadership 
will elude McNabb, Eagles 

continued from pagt I ~ 
are a team that, if not for a late-
season injury to wide receiver 
Terrell Owens and the subsequent 
resting of many staners in the last 
couple games of the season, might 
have been coming into this game 
at 17-1 and as a favorite over the 
16-2 Patriots. But at 15-3, and 
with Owens probably able to play 
only as a third option, the team 
comes in as the underdog. There is 
no doubt that this is a strong team, 
definitely worthy of the Super 
Bowl appearance that has eluded 
them in the last three years. The 
defense is as fast, strong and 
equipped as that of the Patriots, 
fearuring a secondaty with three 
Pro Bowlers that will be the best 
Brady will have faced all year. 

For the Eagles on offense, 
many see Owens' diminished 
speed as a weakness. However, 
even had Owens remained in 
Baltimore before the season and 
not caught a single touchdown, 
quarterback Donovan McNabb 
still presides over the best offense 
hes had since being drafted as an 
Eagle. While lacking the depth at 
rwming back they had last year 
with Duce Staley (now a Steeler) 
and Con'ell Buclchalter (on injured 
reserve all year), the team still has 
the best and most versatile of that 
group with the speedy Brian 
Westbrook. light end LJ. Smith, 
who was an early favorite of 
McNabb in the end rone; Freddie 
Mitchell, he who hilariously 
"thanked" his hands after his two-
touchdown perfonnance in the 
playoffs against the Vikings; and 
underrated Greg Lewis ha\-e all 
come up with the catches when 
they matter most, and the offen-
sive line has been giving the time 

to allow things to happen. Of 
course, the key for the offense, 
whether Owens gets on the field or 
not, is McNabb. The quarterback 
is almost always the offensive posi-
tion that makes the others work, 
but for the Eagles, McNabb's per-
fonnance means more to his team s 
success than any other player in 
the game not named Viele. This is 
the year where McNabb was fully 
able to show his understanding 
and capability for the task at hand, 
not just on the field, but off of it as 
well. While Philly fans feared 
another Conference 
Championship collapse, McNabb 
remained confident throughout 
the playoffs, was masterful in the 
game against the Falcons and, even 
more remarkably, stayed noncha-
lant after the victory. Eagles fans 
might have been happy then with 
just playing in the Super Bowl, but 
it is quite apparent that McNabb is 
not satisfied. 

If there is one quarterback 
whose head Bill Belichick might 
not be able to get into, it might be 
Donovan McNabb. Then again, at 
one point I thought it might have 
been Ben Roethlisberger, or this 
year's incarnation of Peyton 
Manning before that. In the end, 
even if McNabb is able to malce 
things happen, even if Owens 
comes out and gives the Eagles a 
Willis Reed-type emotional lift, 
even ifJimJohnson is able to game 
plan the Eagles defense as well as 
Belichick and Crennel will game 
plan the Patriots', even if Freddie 
Mitchell is able to "Fred-Ex" a 
score into the end rone, and even if 
head coach Andy Reid is able to 
out-bore his coaching counterpan, 
reality will set in for the Eagles and 
bite them on their feathery tails.

continued from page I 
other options for rebuilding 
University House, according to 
Tuzin. 

"We will have to go back to 'plan 
B,'" Tuzin said. "Selling the proper-
ty would provide more than enough 
funds to pay for a new house, with a 
pretty view, on university property." 

However, historical remains dis-
covered on the La Jolla Fanns prop-
erty cO'!lplicate the situation, 
Langley said. 

"If the property had to be sold, 
we would look into moving the 
bones off the site," Langley said. 
"The neighbors are also concerned 
that if the property is sold the land 
might be broken up.~ 

The plans for the new house have 
also been criticized by the Coalition 
of University Employees union. 

"They are always saying they 
don't have enough money .. " union 
Vice President Denis Mitchell-
Carnigan said. "Not enough money 
to pay the employees or for the stu-
dents, but they have enough money 
to pay for a lavish house for the 
chancellor. They should choose the 
most economical options, consider-
ing the fiscal diffkultics the universi-
ty has been experiencing." 

UCOP is prepared to consider 
other options if the campus is unable 
to raise enough private funds, 
Hayward said. 

"We will pick the best options 
based on the resources available," 
Hayward said.

PolUlcal Scl.nce Mljor, 
Thurgood Mlrshall Colleg. 
Hillary Hansen helped the UC San Diego 
women's basketball team to a pair of victories 
over the weekend against Sonoma State and 
San Francisco State. The sophomore from 
Pacifica, Calif. scored 22 points, grabbed 17 

rebounds and dished out six assists over the two-game span. 
With the score sitting at 44-42 in favor of UCSD last Saturday night, 
Hansen scored six points, grabbed six rebounds and had an assist while 
helping the Tritons go on a 17-1 run from the 14:03 mark to the 4: 1 9 
mark in the second half. That run helped the Tritons pull away from a . 
pesky SFSU club and secure its 10th win of the season. She finished 
the night with 16 points and a game· high 12 rebounds in the contest. 
She and her teammates return to action this weekend at Cal State L.A. 
and Cal State Bakersfield.

Women's basketball reigns at RIMAe 
UCSD sweeps a pair of games against Sonoma, SFSU 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
As!OOCiate Sports Editor 

Playing in front of the home 
crowd at RIMAC Arena has been 
rewarding for the UCSD women's 
basketball team. The Tritons have a 
commanding 7 -2 home record, 
including a weekend sweep of 
Sonoma State, 70-60, and San 
Francisco State, 71-56, on Jan. 28 
and Jan. 29, respectively. 

UCSD (10-6 overall, 6-4 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) benefitted from a well-
balanced offense Jan. 29 when it 
hosted San Francisco State (4-13 
overall , 3-7 CCAA). Similar to the 
previous game, the Tritons went on 
a 15-0 offensive burst in the second 
half, making it difficult for the 
Gators to catch up. 

Sophomore guard Leora Juster 
led the way for the Tritons, with 18 
points, and currently has the best 
shooting percentage of all Triton 
players so far this season, sinking 
47,4 percent of her attempts. 
Meanwhile, UCSD saw a pair of 
double-doubles from sophomore 
forward Hillary Hansen, with 16 
poin tS and 12 boards, and senjor 
center Ma rgaret J ohnson , who 
added 10 point and II rebounds. 

Johnson reached a milestone, 
scoring her I ,000th point in the sec-
ond half \vith a jump shot. She is the 
sixth all -time scorer for the Tritons, 
with 1,004 pointS, and is third in 

rebounds with 809. 
Although UCSD struggled from 

the £loor, shooting only 25-for-72, 
the team was nearly flawless from 
the free-throw line, going 19-for-
22 . The Tritons also dominated in 
rebounds, 53-38, and San 
Francisco's paltry 28.6-percent 
shooting kept the Cators from stay-
ing in the game. 

However, the Gators' Biance 
Rayford contributed 14 pointS, 14 
rebounds and two blocks while 
Leslie Miler added 13 points. 

Against Sonoma State (7 -9 over-
all, 6-3 CCAA) the night before, 
UCSD exploded offensively, with 
four players scoring in the double 
digits. The team was led by Juster, 
who scored 16 points and went 7-
for-II in shooting. Johnson con-
tributed 15 points and II rebounds, 
followed by sophomore Kim 
Buffum with 12 points. Juruor for-
ward Karina Siam also contributed 
11 points for UCSD. 

The Tritons took control of the 
first half and had an eight-point lead 
heading into halftime. However, 
the Seawolves bounced back and 
tied it at 46-46 with just over 11 
minutes left to play. UCSD refused 
to let Sonoma State steal the lead 
and started a 17 -I scoring run late 
in the game. The Tritons hung onto 
their lead for the win in front of 740 
fans on Spirit Night. 

In the effort, the Seawolves' 
Lindsay Van Norstrand and Janelle 

Lombardi added 12 points apiece 
wrule Maribel Ambriz and Genny 
Anderson each had rune points. 

UCSD plays a parr of CCAA 
games on the road, starting on Feb.

The Tritons hold an all-time 8-3 
edge over the Golden Eagles. 

UCSD plays the following day 
against Cal State Bakersfield, who 
holds a 2-7 edge over UCSD.

Following two straight losses, 
the UCSD men's volleyball team is 
off to its worst start in recent mem-
ory and is set to play three straight 
games on the road in the next eight 
days. Last week, the winless 
Tritons (0-7 overall, 0-6 Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation) fell to 
No. 4 Pepperdine and the 
uruanked USC Trojans. 

In Malibu, Calif., on Jan. 28, 
UCSD lost in strajght sets to the 
second-best team in the nation, 
Pepperdine, 30-26, 30-23, 30-23. 
In the first game, the Tritons were 
outhlt by their opponents, .310-
.275. That was the closest they 
came to keeping up with the 
Waves (5-1 overall , 5-1 MPSF). 
As UCSD dropped &om a .27 5 
atta,"k percentage in the first game 
to .126 in the second and subse-
quently to a dismal .095, the 
Waves wavered slightly between 
the first and second games, drop-
ping from .310 to .272, but 
improved in the final game to a 
spectacular .438 attack percentage. 
For the last game, the Tritons 
were outhit .336 - .168. 

Senior outside hitter Luke 
Honnette led rus team in the loss, 
rrus time with 14 kills and three 
digs, while upholding a .281 attack 
percentage. Seruor libero Dickens 
Tai, seruor outside rutter Ad.am 
Toren, freshman middle blocker 
John Mark Wendler and sopho-
more setter Brooks Dierdorff also 
had good games, especially Toren, 
who in his first fujI game back &om 
injury had 20 attacks, including 
eight kills, six digs and an ace. Taj 
had 11 digs, Wendler had six kills 
and two block assists. while 
Dierdorff notched 36 assists. 

The disappointing showing 
came only two days after another 

straight-set loss, to USc. The 
Tritons, winners of only three sets 
on the season, two against UC 
Santa Barbara and one against the 
Uruversity of the Pacific, have lost 
five games in strajght sets so far 
thls year. 

The game against the Trojans 
(2-6 overall, 1-4 MPSF) was 
another statistical blowout, as USC 
outhit the Tritons in every game. 
In the first, UCSD recorded a .139 
percentage versus the Trojans' 
.444. Despite an improvement to a 
respectable .286 attack percentage, 
USC still managed to outhjt 
UCSD with a .432 mark. The final 
game was both teams' worst 
games, with the Trojans falling to a 
0308 stat and the Tritons diving to 
an abysmal .065 . For the match, 
USC outhit UCSD .400-.148. Just 
like the match against Pepperdine, 
the Tritons managed their lowest 
percentage in the final game; 
UCSD has yet to show its fans that 
it can be a clutch team or mount a 
comeback. 

In addition to being outhit, the 
lritons notched four blocks com-
pared to USC's 8.5, and tallied 17 
digs versus the Trojans' 22. 

Honnette led the Tritons agajn, 
tallying 12 kills with a .3 50 attack 
percentage. Sophomore outside 
rutter Mke Reuter snagged eight 
kills while seruor setter Nate Jones 
(20 assists) and Dierdorff (14 
assists) split the playing time. 

UCSD will play three road 
games rrus week, against No. I 
Long Beach, No. 10 UC Irvine 
and No.2 UCLA. 

The Tritons will play the 4gers 
011 Feb. 4, the Anteaters on Feb. 9 
and the Bruins on Feb. 11. Last 
year, the Tritons lost two games 
each to the Bruins and the 4gers, 
but managed a spectacular five-
game upset in one of their two 
games to the then-No. 9 Anteaters.

Pats' dynasty 
now appears 

inevitable

Sometimes you can try and try to convince yourself of some-rrung, but in the end, reason 
usually wins out and the truth 
becomes oh-so-obvious. Whether it 
be the childhood conviction that it 
really was Santa Claus who put the 
bike under your Christmas tree, or 
the more current belief that you can 
always study tomorrow, in the end, 
you usually realize that - like it or 
not - some things cannot be avoid-
ed. 

For the past few weeks, I've been 
telling myself that the New England 
Patriots aren't as good as advertised, 
have a few weaknesses, will fall in a 
big game and won't be mentioned 
among the great football dynastic of 
all time. 

Well, reality has set in. No, there 
is not a Santa Claus. If you don't 
study today, you'll end up not study-
ing tomorrow. And yes, the Patriots 
will win their second-straigh~ Super 
Bowl and their thlrd title in the last 
four years. Quite simply, reality 
bites. 

I harbor no hatred toward the 
Patriots. I honestly do admire what 
they have been able to do. They're 
fundamentally sound, physically 
tough and lacking in huge egos or 
annoyi ng personalities. And yet, like 
the San Antonio Spurs (who exhibit 
these same traits on the basketball 
court) New England just annoys me. 
I don't want every play on the foot-
ba ll field to be so mechanical. I can't 
stand watching dropped pass after 
dropped pass just because the oppo-
nent knows they're going to get beat 
down like a red-headed stepchjld. I 
like my football with a little pizzazz, 
a little high-steppin', Sharpie-
sigrun', trash-talbn " "Prirnetime"-
in' that disgusts Joe Buck and angers 
Paul Tagljabue but makes me laugh, 
cheer and want to run into the end 
zone and do a Lambeau Leap, Mile-
lligh Salute or Dirty Bird dance of 
my own. 

That is not the New England 
Patriots. At the same time, [ won't 
say that they're boring. The Patriots 
play smart football, but it's not bor-
ing football . It:s not the Packers of 
the '60s runrung the sweep every 
play. Thjs is a team t1,at can be very 
innovative and very smart. Offensive 
coordinator Charlie Weis doesn't 
shy away from calling an end zone 
pass to a linebacker, a defensive 

. coordinator readily switching from a 
three-man defensive line to a two-
man line to, on occasion, a no-man 
line. The hooded demon that is head 
coach Bill Belichick is boring, but 
even that is a self-imposed boredom. 
He's boring because he wants to be 
boring, because he doesn't want to 
be a story like his former mentor Bill 
Parcells was (and still is). Belichick 
has done what no other salary-cap-
era coach has been able to: construct 
a team where the only goal, the 'only 
issue, the only item that the media is 
ever able to pry out of them is the 
game at hand. 

It wouldn't be right to overlook 
the other team in the Super Bowl, 
because Coach Belicruclc, his mati-
nee-idol quarterback Tom Brady 
and the rest of the Patriots certajnly 
will not. The Pruladelprua Eagles
