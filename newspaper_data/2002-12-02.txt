State shortfall hits SIO 
At Scripps, best of times, worst of times 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editor 

During what should have been 
onc of the best years for thc 100-
year-old Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, its centennial cel-
ebration has been marred by one 
of the worst periods of state fund-
ing cutbacks since the 1930s, and 
promises to result in layoffs and to 
threaten severa l notable programs 
at the institution. 

Scripps, which received a 10-
percent, or $1.267 million, cut in 
research funding from the 
California state legislature this 
year, is making plans to reduce or 
cut funding for certain programs 
and wi ll layoff about 20 staff 
members over the next three years. 
Scripps currently employs about 
1,200 staff members, including 
about 190 graduate students. 

"Scripps is celebrating its 100th 
anniversary this year, and this is 
the worst year we've ever had from 
a financial standpoint," said Tom 
Collins, deputy director of admin-
istrative affairs at Scripps. 

The cut in state research fund-
ing caught the institution at a par-
ticularly vulnerable time, having 
faced cumulative state fundin cuts 
sincc 1992 that have resulted in a 
net reduction of 30 percent in state 
funding, according to Collins. 

Both SIO Director Charles F. 
Kennel and UCSD Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes committed their 
support toward finding alternative 
sources of funding for the institu-
tion. 

In a Nov. 26 speech, before the 
chancellor made his last of three 
State of the Campus addresses, 
Kennel told an SIO audience of 

Tyler Huff/ Guordian 

Hard times: An employee at Scripps Institution of Oceanography voices his 
concerns about fund ing cuts at 510 to Chancellor Robert C. Dynes on Nov. 26. 

170 individuals that the current 
funding situation was "inevitable," 
citing a decade long reduction in 
spending. 

Kennel said the financial 
model used by Scripps over the 
past 50 years was "no longer 
viable," and outlined a three-part 
plan that will span the next decade 
and bring in alternative sources of 
capital to give the institution more 
leverage to endure changes in 
state-supported funding. 

In the next year, SIO plans to 
mitigate the immediate effects on 
state-funded programs. This 
means seeking private donations, 
as well as short-term help from 
the University of California 
Office of the President and from 
UCSD, according to Kennel. 

Over the next three years, 
Scripps plans on implementing a 
new multi-source funding model 
that will look more to federal agen-
cies and to private foundations for 
funding. The emphasis of this pro-
gram, according to Kennel, will be 
to bring in long-term funding, 
which S10 lost the most from the 
state research funding cuts. 

In ten years, Scripps hopes to 
replace 15 percent of university 
funding with endowment income. 
In order to accomplish this, 
Scripps will need to triple their 
current annual private fundrais-
ing. Additionally, Scripps hopes to 
expand to a full -service education-
al enterprise, including general

Senate discusses UC affairs 
Merced campus, Prop. 47 among rep6rts heard 

By GAELLE FAURE 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's division of the 
Academic Senate convened on 
Nov. 26 to hear reports on the 
progress of UC Merced, the 
implementation of comprehensive 
review and the revision of admis-
sions tests. 

The meeting commenced with 
Chair Joel E. Dimsdale stating 
that it is not yet clear how the 
recently disclosed California state 
deficit of over $20 billion will 
affect the implementation of Prop 
47, which is to allocate $56.9 mil-
lion to UCSD. 

"So far, signals are that K-12 
amI health care will be the most 
significantly cut," Dimsdale said. 

Biochemisuy professor Douglas 
Magde, who attended the UC 

Merced groundbrealcing cere-
monies on Oct. 25 , reported on the 
current situation of the newest UC 
campus. He heard addresses made 
by UC Merced's chancellor, Carol 
Tomlinson-Keasey, as well as by 
Stanford professor of physics and 
Nobel laureate Robert Laughlin, 
who grew up in the Central Valley. 
Magde spoke ofTomlinson-Keasey 
as a "trendsetter" and as the first 
female founder of a major research 
universi ty. 

Gov. Gray Davis, as well as 
many community members and 
students, were also in attendance 
for the founding ceremonies of the 
first research university of the 21st 
century and the first major univer-
sity in the San Joaquin Valley.

Re ident advisers at UCSD were 
awarded the Program of the Year 
award at tile 2002 Pacitic Affil iate of 
College and University Residence 
Halls Conference, held at California 
State University, Chico last month. 

T he award was given not for the 
overall residential life program, but 
for a specific event held last May 
called the Rezzies, according to 
Jeremy Gallagher, a Sixth C liege

UC comes to contract 
terms with police union 
Sides agree on wage increase rate 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

After six weeks of bargaining, 
the University of California and the 
Federated University Police 
Officer Association ratified a new 
employment contract on Nov. 21. 

FUPOA is a union for the uni-
versity's police department and rep-
resents more than 200 UC police 
officers. 

At the negotiations, wages were 

the central issue of discussion. The 
new contract will provide UC 
police officers with a 1.5-percent 
general salary increase, effective 
Oct. I. The contract will also pro-
vide campus-specific increases as a 
response to local market condi -
tions. 

"UC police officers do a tremen-
dous job for the entire university 
community, and we 're very happy

BRIEFLY 
Study shows diuretics 
increase death rate 

A recent study suggests that diuretics, 
the most commonly used therapy for kid-
ney failure, may actually cause a substan-
tially higher death rate and inability to recov-
er In patients dia~nosed with kidney failure. 

The study, which was conducted over six 
years at fou r California hospitals by 
researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine 
and the University of Cal ifornia at San 
FranCISCo, documented 552 critical~ ill, hospi-
talized patients who were given diuretics. 

Diuretics are commonly prescribed to 
Increase urine output in patients whose 
kidneys fail to produce enough urine, an 
Indicator that harmful waste products are 
being retained rather than filtered out by 
the kidneys. Previous studies have shown 
that between 300,000 and 500,000 hos-
pitalized patients in the United States 
develop kidney failure after admittance, 
and about 50 to 75 percent of those 
patients are traditionally given diuretics. 

The UCSD-UCSF study found Ihat diuretic 
use was associated with a 68-percent 
increase in mortality and a 77-percent 
increase in the non-recovery of kidney func-
tion. 

The results of the study were published 
in the Nov. 27 issue of the Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 

UCSD included in NIH's 
study of HIV effects 

The effects drug therapies used to treat 
patients with H IV have on the central ner-
vous system will be the focus of a $22.3 
million, six-center study called C.H.A.R.T.E.R. 
(CNS HIV Anti-Retrovi ral Therapy Effects 
Research), which is being funded by the 
National Institutes of Health. 

The five-year project brings together dinical 
and research centers at the UCSD School of

center; Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; 
Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York; 
University of Texas Medical Branch in 
Galveston, Texas; Universi ty of Washington in 
Seattle; and Washington University in St Louis. 

The incurSion of H IV into the brain and 
CNS can lead to inflammation, nerve cell 
damage and abnormalities in the brain. 
Complications range from learning or 
memory defici ts, to impairment of co~n i tive 
or motor skills, to full-blown dementia and 
loss of motor skills. Some patients develop

Oral smallpox drug wins 
Popular Science award 
The oral smallpox drug developed by 

UCSD School of Medicine researchers at 
Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System 
has been selected by Popular Science maga-
zine for a "2002 Best of What's New Award" 
in the medical technology category. 

The oral drug. called hexadecyloxypropyl-
cidofoVlf, blocks the activity of variola, the 
virus that ca uses small pox and orthopox 
viruses, and halts their ability to replicate and 
spread in tissue cultu re and animals studies. 
Developed as part of a national research 
effort to design antivi ra l drugs for people 
infected by smallpox, HDP-COV is not yet 
available for human use. 

The award is announced in the maga-
zine's December issue. 

Berkeley's law school 
dean accused, resigns 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. - The dean 

of UC Berkeley's school of law resigned 
Nov. 27 in connection with allegations he 
sexually harassed a former law student. 

Dean John Dwyer denied the charges of 
sexual harassment, but admitted to a single 
consensual encounter with a student two 
years ago. 

"I acknowledge that this reflected a seri-
ous error in judgement [sic) on my part, and 
was inappropriate," Dwyer wrote in an in te r-
nal memo to the Boalt Law School com-
munity. 

Dwyer also resigned his faculty posi tion. 
In a farewell memo to his former stu-

dents and colleagues, Dwyer stressed that 
"there is no allegation that any form of sex-
ual intercourse occurred:' 

Dwyer joined the law school's faculty in 
1984 and was named its dean in 2000. 

UC Berkeley began conducting an inves-
tigation of Dwyer's involvement with a for-
mer law student as soon as the allegations 
were brought to its attention, according to a 
university statement. 

The UC Berkeley press office was unavailable 
to the Oaily Californian for comment at press 
time.

way how much this campus mea nt to the peo-
ple of the Central Va lley, but r didn't realize 
thi s wltil the groundbreaking," Magde said. 

He reported that the first contract, which 
incl udes building of roads and a bridge, has 
bee n approved, and that a second one, which 
is to secure the construction of the fi rst three 
bu ildi ngs, is in the works. 

UC Merced has hired 14 academic profes-
sorial chairs, and according to Magde, the 
university is confident of three more. It also 
hi red a dean of student affa irs, a dean of engi-
neering and librarians, but no facu lty. . 

However, the task force is currently mak-
ing eight more offers, and Magde said' all the 
candidates have disti ngui shed resumes. UC 
Merced hopes to have 80 faculty members by 
the time the campus opens to its first cl ass of 
about 1,000 students in the fall of 2004. 

"If the students are going to apply some-
time in 2003, we need a catalog sometime in 
the next few months, but we have no facul ty, 

. so it was a li ttle hard to have course descrip-
tions," Magde sa id . "But we did discuss 
grades, adds and drops, etc." 

Magde reported other chall enges facing 
the task force, including its hope to have a 
division of engineering and a school of busi-
ness as soon as possible. 

He also reported that UC Merced has 
begun its dual admissions program, which 

accepts students who have completed sufficient 
equival encies in comlmmity colleges, 111 the 
hopes of attracting transfer students From day

In other systemwide issues, chemi cal edu -
cation professo r and Chai r of the UC Board

Barbara Sawrey reported on the success of the 
use of comprehensive review in last year's 
admissions process. 

"[B.O.A.R.S.l was very pleased with what 
we fo und , and the task was completed on 
time, which was a real feat when you had to 
read thousa nds of addi tional documents," 
Sawrey sa id . 

She commented on the public's mixed 
reaction to the changes, hoping that the poli-
cy would soon become more accepted . 

"VVe've changed things, so that makes 
everybody nervous," Sawrey said. "We 're 
looking at improving the written materi al we 
put out to explain the process." 

Sawrey also discussed other B.OAR.S. 
issues, including the revisions of admissions 
tests, The SAT is being revamped so that the 
SAT I wi ll have a writing component, the SAT 
IT writing test will disappear, and the difficulty 
of the SAT 1 math section will increase by at 
least a year's worth of material, all by 2005. 
Sawrey said that B.OA R.S. will have to look at 
these changes, which could affect UC admis-
sions standards for 2006.

Scripps: Funding for SIO cut by 10 percent 
conlim~ed from page I 

educa tion, undergraduate majors, 
graduate studies and post-graduate 
research. 

Dynes, who made gri lll predic-
tions about the immediate fumre 
of state funding given California's 

20 billion deficit in it $75 bill ion 
budget, said in his Nov. 2(J State of 
the Campus address at Scripps that 
that the niver ity of California 
and UCSD remai n committed to 
supporti ng Scri pps in both the 
short and the long term. 

"S IO is a fu nding priority," 
DI'nes said . 

. T he chancellor mentioned the 
institutional campaign starred by 
UCSD to increase priva te fi nancial 
support and increase pu blic aware-
ness of the university's mi ssion. 

Dynes added that the same state 
research cuts that affected SIO also 
a f!Cc ted the UC Davis School of 
Agriculture. Because of the politi -
cal leve rage behind the agriculture 
industry in Cal iforn ia, Dynes said 
he hopes the lobbyi ng efforts asso-
cia ted with preventing further 
research funding cuts for the agri -
culture school wi ll also help 
Scripps in the futu re . 

In the meantime, Scripps faces 
some tough choices in order to 
preserve tI;e quali ty of its programs 
and research. Coll ins said the 
immediate pl an at Scripps is to fi nd 
alternative ways to maintai n most 
progr:1tn and staff members. 

""Vhat we did was rea lly try and 
identify thuse actions that would 
mi nimize the impact on our peo-
ple," Col lins said. 

La yoffs would affect museum 
scienti ts who maintain the SIO 
Oceanographic Collections in the 
Marine Science Divi ion, mari ne 
technicians and resea rch a soc iates 
in the Cali forn ia Cooperative 
Oceanic Fishery rnvesti ga tions, 

and people in central adm ini stra-
tion, according to Collins. 
Cutbacks woul d occur over the 
next three yea rs to reduce the over-
all impact on programs and staff. 

T he largest cuts, without 
affecti ng staff, wi ll be made in the 
Fundi ng fo r SIO's large fleet of 
research vessels . Coll ins said there 
is no SIO staff associated with cuts 
ro the research fl eet funding. 
Scripps. which operates fo ur 
research vessels and aile resea rch 
platform, uses one of the largest 
research vessel fl eets for an institu-
tion of its ki nd, collectively log-
ging about 100,000 nautical mi les 
a year. 

CutS that will almost ce rtainly 
result in layoffs will be to two pro-
grams: the Marine Sciences 
Division and the California 
Cooperative Oceanic Fishery 
Investigations. 

T he Marine Science Division 
maintains Scripps' extensive coll ec-
tions of preserved marine life, S3111-
pies of the ocean fl oor and sedi-
ment samples. J ointly, there are 
four coll ections - the Marine 
Verte brates Coll ection, Pelagic 
Invertebrates Collection, Benthic 
Invertebrates Collection and 
Geologica l Collections. Should 
alternative funding not be found , 
the coll ections would have to be 
maintained by an o rganiution that 
could provide adequate funding for 
their continued preservation. 

The entire collection includes 
over two mi ll ion Fish specimens, 
11 0,000 zoo pl ankto n sa mples , 
40,000 assorted ben tllic inve rte-
brates species, as we ll as geologic 
samples that cover the last 75 m il-
lion yea r history of the ocean 
tl oor. 

"These things are so profoundly 
important, that it's not the SOrt of 
thing that you can take and pour 

down the garbage disposa l," Coll ins 
said. "\ oVe would have to find some-
body else to mai ntain them ." 

H .]. Walker, a senior museum 
scien tist at Scripp and a collection 
ma nager for the Marine 
Vertebrates Collection , said 
Scri pps wottl d be hard pressed to 
find another instinltion, museum 
or university to take on such a large 
collection. 

"There isn't all )' institu tion -
even the Smithsonian [1nstitutionl 
which has one of the biggest col-
lections in the entire worl d - who 
could incorporate all this [collec-
tion\," he said. "They JUSt can't do 
it. " 

Another program at risk is the 
California Cooperative O ceanic 
Fishery Investigations, which was 
es tablished in 1948. 

Collins said the CalCOFI pro-
gram is important because it pro-
vides the most detai led time series 
- or continued observati ons - of 
any part of the ocean over a long 
period of time. H e noted tlla r the 
program has made important 
obse rvations since its inception, 
showing th at the abundance of 
zooplankton essential to the 
marine food cha in has dropped 75 
percent from 1950 to 1998 and the 
average ocean temperature has 
increased one to two degrees centi -
grade. Changes such as these, he 
sa id , are importa nt to the fiel d of 
oceanography. 

[n the short terln. Scripps is 
see ki ng federa l funding to secure at 
least three more CalCO FI cruises. 

SIO officials warn that ul ti-
mately the enti re UCSD campus 
will feel the effects of tile state 
fundin g reducti ons at Scrip ps. 

"UCSD was bo rn here at 
Scripps," Collins said. "What's 
happening to this insti tution is 
happening to all UCSD."

day's work, you don't get an honest day's 
pay. Your neighbor, on the other hand, 
does not have a steady job and is on wel-
fare; consequently, he or she gets more 
m oney from the state than you do from 
your job. Frustrated? I bet. 

That's where t~e "living wage" comes 
in. Hundreds of thousands of 
employees across the nation 

$14,900 (adjusted for inflation). 
Currently, the income is $1,300 lower 
than that year's poverty line for a family of 
two adults and two children. 

According to U.S . lahor standards, the 
national minimum wage stands at $5 .15 
per hour. California 's minimum wage is 
above the national standard at $6.75 per 
hour. A "living wage" means giving an 
employee a wage that is higher than the 
two former standards, allowing them to 
live in that city or county and support a 
family above the poverty line (given that 
each city's poverty line is different). 

Minimum wage advocates fail to see 
that the cost of Jiving for an 
average person and family dif-

still live in poverty, regardless 
of the fact that they have a 
full -time job. These are men 
and women who take our kids 
to school , drive our city buses, 
dispose of our trash and main-
tain our cities. These individ-

PRO 
fer greatly from city to eity 
and from state to state. Just 
because you are abiding by 
California minimum wage law 
does not mean you are offer-
ing an opportunity to live 

uals work full time and yet 
manage to find themselves below the 
poverty line. Minimum wage doesn't suf-
fice in the growing economy, and many 
families - families with full-time workers 
- find themselves in poor living condi-
tions. Like most people, I've always 
believed that if you work full time for a 
living, you should not have to live in 
poverty. We must support a "living" wage 
for a better standard of living for our 
community. 

The average income of a low income 
working family was a horrific 11 percent 
below the average in 1979 . In 1997, the 
average income of such a family stood at 

above the poverty line. Wage 
standards should flu ctuate 

according to geographical considerations 
that take into account actual regional 
expenditures instead of conservative, 
national ballpark figures. Food, housing, 
transponation and child care costs range 
in different areas, and thus the minimum 
wage should be adjusted to recognize 
these discrepancies. 

Many of us have this image that pover-
ty is what we see on weekend infomer-
cials, where Golden Age celebrities

Asia or pledge our spare change to a

THE LIVING WAGE 

Working

Pit ~ng/Guordian 

Artificial pay increases are bad 
for business, increase inflation 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The growing divide between the eco-
nomic classes in American society is one of 
the biggest issues facing us today. While 
bringing the poor up to "living wages" is a 
great goal, achieving that by large hikes in 
federal minimum wage requirements is the 
wrong way to go about it. 

Contrary to popular belief, raising the 
minimum wage would affect the salaries of 
virtually every hourly employee in a given 
company, If the bottom end of the pay 
sca.le is moved up, then the other hourly 
employees are going to want 
their salaries to go up. A large 

costs rising, business owners would be 
forced to either absorb the added costs with 
smaller profits or pass it on to the con-
sumer. Large corporations would be in a 
much better position to absorb the cost of a 
rising minimum wage than a small-business 
owner. With corporations keeping their 
prices the same at slightly less of a profit 
and small businesses raising the cost of 
their products, it would seem that small 
businesses would suffer from fewer patrons, 
and therefore even fewer profits. 

Another danger of raising minimum 
wage requirements is a chain reaction 
that would end up raising the cost of liv-

ing and putting everyone 
exactly where they were eco-

number of businesses that 
would be affected the greatest 
by a minimum wage hike have 
union jobs. According to most 
union contracts, salary is paid 
on a scale; more experienced 
people get more money. If the 

(ON nomically before the raise of the minimum wage. With salaries risi ng throughout businesses, costs are inevitably going' to be passed 
on to consumers. Even if 

bottom end of that scale is 
moved up, it is in many union contracts 
that the rest of the salaries must go up as 
well . Even if it weren't mandated by con-
tract, it is hard to believe that an owne 
could keep employees when he moves up a 
minimum wage kid to a salary that another 
worker slaved to get for over a year. It's just 
bad business, 

In a feeble economy where small busi-
nesses are struggling and corporate 
America seems to be taking over, raising 
the minimum wage would only increase the 
divide that it seeks to bridge. The truth is 
that when the minimum wage is raised, 
small businesses suffer. With overhead 

large corporations (or deep-
pocketed small-business own-

ers) absorbed initial rises in overhead 
costs, they would soon raise the prices 
again once the small businesses folded . 
It 's extremel)t naive to think that a corpo-
ration with a monopoly on a market 
would not try to recoup lost profits. This 
would raise the cost of goods and services 
everywhere in one's life. So even though 
the salaries were raised, it would cause 
inflation of prices and put everyone back 
where they were to start with. T h e only 
difference would be that more people 
would be in the poor end of the econom-

over a pint 

Chris Taylor 
" G 'mornin' to ye. We' ll start 

ta lking tOday about - Oh, 
first I want to wish a happy 

T hanksgivi ng to the American sm -
de nts in the class," said one o f my 
pro fessors las t Thursday. To the 
two Americans in the hall , this was 
a very ki nd gesnlre . In fac t, all the 
Irish students were kind to us 
Americans beyond th e call of duty. 
Obviously, Thanksgiving is not 
usually eve n a pa sing thought in 
Cork. 

Come to think of it , this is the 
first event held sacred by 
Americans that I ha ve had to 
ex pl ai n to thl: Iri sh stude nts. 
"Th:lI1ksgiving' Is th at the ho liday 
where people dress in funny hats 
and belt buckles?" asked o ne of my 
fr iends. "What do you even do on 
Thanksgiving, other than watch 
Amcric:1I1 football?" asked another 
with a sta rtling amount of sinceri-
ty. 

Admittedly, it's been fun being 
able to share our young culture 
with intrigucd Irish students. 
However, these opportunities havc 
been few and far between. 

T he reason for this is quite 
ohvious, as most coll ege students 
wi ll tell you. G lobalization and 
mass commercialization have 
brough t Am erican culture fl ood ing 
to al l corne rs of the globe. [n ork, 
there is a McDonald 's, Burger King 

and Virgin \1egastore on the arne 
street, CO! lplete with Big Macs, 
Orco shakes and Avril Lavigne : a 
shrin e to American cul tur e. 
However, whi le the likes of ami-
ca pitalists take to the streets 
demonstrating the evils of destroy-
ing other culmres through global-
iza tion, very few of us seem to be 
asking, "Hey, what about our cu l-
nIrc?" 

Protesters are so conce rn ed 
with othe r countries' cultures that 
th ey have completely forgotten 
our own. Other culture are in no 
more danger than our own adoles -
cent one, though for different rea-
sons. I maintain that if there is a 
cultural problem with globaliza-
tio n , it is not so much because of 
our infri ngement o n other peo-
pl es' cultures, but ra th er because 
of its dangerous effect on o u r 
own. 

That is not to say that we have a 
weak culture. Without question, 
American influence is fe lt strongly 
around the world. Therefore, it's 
n ot endangered by other countri es' 
encroaching cultures, but rather it 
is in danger of becoming a global 
culture th:tt has no definite home. 
In that respect, our culture is the 
most endangered on the planet. As 
any European will tell you, there 
are very few aspects of American 
culture tha t are not already kn own, 
if not assimi lated, in th eir everyday 
livl:s. 

For exa mple, every country has 
a sense of humor it ca ll s its own.

LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
Comprehensive review 

deemed sucessful 
Editor: 

Each November, thousands of 
high school seniors apply for 
freshman admission to one of the 
U n iversity of Ca lifornia's eight 
undergraduate campuses. To bet-
ter evaluate those who apply to 
one of the ca mpuses with more 
applicants than available seats, the 
Universi ty of Ca lifo rnia imple-
mented a policy known as compre-
hensive review last year. 

The six campuses using com-
prehensive review have 14 selec-
ti on criteria. The criteria and the 
importance placed on academic 
achi eve ment have re mained 
unchanged in recent years. The 
difference is that these selective 
campuses now look at merit in a 
broader context for all smdents 
instead of for o nly some, as previ-
ously occurred . 

In addition to assessing grades 
in college preparatory courses and 
test scores, these campuses look 
for tenacity, leade rship, special ta l-
ents, creativity, community service 
and evidence of the commitment 
needed to success full y pursue a 
college degree. 

In a nutshell, they are looking 
for academi c and persona l 
ac hievement - which demon-
strate a student is likely to thrive at 
a UC school. 

This year, when the ,ccond 
round of :lpplic:lnts undergo COI11-
prehen ivc rel' iew, the university 
will exp<1 nd its longstandi ng verifi-
cation f all students' high school 
records to include verification of 
some of th e other criteria used to 
make admissions decisions. 

It has long been our experience 
that th e vast majority of students 
are trlllhful in their applications. II 
pi lot verification program that 
examined app lications submitted 
in fall 200 1 found no excepti ons. 
When the applications of approxi-
matelv 400 students were random-
ly salT;pled, each and every o ne was 
able to verify their informatio n. 

While the Board of Admissions 
and Relations wi th Schools does 
not expect that the University of 
Cali fornia's expanded verification 
processes will detect major irregu-
larities, we believe it is important 
to monitor the accuracy and relia-
bi lity of the information used in 
the admissions process. 

So far, news of this expanded 
effort has been well-received by 
many high school counselors and 
students who say it will reinforce 
the message tha t applicants must 
comple te their appl ications truUl-
fu lly or ri k being removed from 
conside ra tion for admission on 
any UC campus.

in mind is that compreh ensive

Pro: Workers' rights essential to families 
continued from page 4 

needy family in Central America. 
However, what most of us don't 
realize is that poverty co-e,~i ts 
with us in our vcry own communi-
ties. When an employment insti -
ultion disregards an individual's 
right to unionize, 1'0 possess 
insurance benefits and to have 
sick days, that institution essen-
tially denies that individual's right 
to basic human needs . The 
employer also dooms that person 's 
dependent famil y to poverty. This 
is why there is an urgent need to 
recognize a living wage - a wage 
that allows employers to provide 
for their cmployees and their fam-
il)' just above the poverty line, at 
the very least. Employers arc not 
only responsible for the livelihood 
of their employees, but for the 
liveli hood of the community as 
well. 

While many people believe 
that permitting a living w:lge will 
increase unemployment, com pany 
relocations, contracting fees and 
city budgets, studies conducted by 
the New Age Party in Baltimore 

:lnd Los Angeles have proven 
something quite contrary to these 
claims. According to these studies, 
it was concluded that the es tab-
lishment of a living wage ordi-
nance caused no net increase in 
the city budget (the expenditure 
increase to the city after the living

humor that is often misunder-
stood by foreigners. Certainly, 
American students have had to 
accli ma te to this odd s<;nse of 
humor, saturated by irony and 
cynicism - not to mention alco-
hol. However, every Irish student 
completely understands and 
embraces American humor, 
beca use everyone crowds around 
the television every Thursday to 
watch "Friends." Also, I am con-
vinced that the reason Europe 
always hits our political hot but-
toIlS is because they have all 
watched "The Simpsons" so 
many times that they know every 
mi nute detail with which to sa ti-
rize and criticize our country. 

Secondly, beca use Ameri ca is 
so immersed in the sea rch for 
its heritage, no one wants to 
co nsi le r a tradition 
"American ." Thousands of 

Americans rush into Ireland 
every year looking for their her-
itage or roots. Then they return 
to the States eager to practice 
their new-found traditions, 
which, to them, are obviously 
better than the ones America 
has begun. Furthermore, politi-
cal correctness won't even allow 
us to call ourselves American . 
Everyone is considered 
Mexican-American, African-
American, even Scandinavian-
American. I used to laugh at 
this and proud ly assert that I am 
merely American, until some-
one earne tl y referred to me on 
some paperwork as lr is h-
American, despite my Irish 
an cestry being at leas t six ge n-
erations removed. l 'm not say-
ing it's wrong to search for 
roots, but the deni al of what

rarely acted upon . Furthermore, 
this same study concluded that 
implementing 3 living wage 
according to that city'S standard 
would ultimately save the stare 
and local taxpayers about $33.3 
million by reducing the need for 
food stamps and healthcare enti -
tlements. And while lawmakers 
will definitely have to deal with 
typical employer non-compliance 
and take extra steps to make sure 

th~t a living wage ordinance will 
affect a larger alllount of employ-
ees, these are definitely obstacles 
that can and should be overcome 
in light of the benefits that ca n be 
reaped. 

Eventually, living wage cam-
paigns and ord inances will coun-
teract the negative economic pat-
terns that have been plaguing 
lower income workers, and our 
communities can finally see all 
their citizens live a more di gnifi ed 
lifestyle - an American lifestYle

Letter: Carter brokered Israel .. Egypt peace 
cominued from page 5 

common practice in an informative 
newspaper, but I think revisionist 
history goes beyond the line. 

The authors sta tes that former 
president Jimmy Carter was 
"Generally regarded as one of the 
most nai ve presidents, especially in 
foreign affairs (remember the 1ran 
Hostage crisis')." Your author is one 
of the people who perpetuates this 
view by leaving out Carter's greatest 
achievement: the Israeli govern-
ment's first and only successful land-
for-peace deal between Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Mencahim Begin. 
Caner helped personally negotiate 
the refilrn of the Sinai Peninsula as 
well as dismantle all of the Israeli 
settlements in the region. Since this 
deal, Egypt and 1srael have been at 
peace, like they had been from 1948 
to 1979. This is much more then 
President George W. Bush has cur-

rently accomplished for peace in the 
Middle East thus far, and is strange-
ly ab ent when talking about former 
president Carter. I t should also be 
noted that Carter tried his best to 
solve the Iran Hostage Cri i with 
military action that was poorly 
devised by his advisers, but attempts 
were made. Carter does not get the 
credit for the release of the hostages 
even though it was his administra-
tion that got them sent home. 

The most blatant thing wrong 
with your author's article is his state-
ment, "As I recal l, it was only after 
the world followed U.S. lead, turned 
away from isolation and appease-
ment that Hitler was defeated, to the 
benefit of all ." The author recalls 
wrong since it was the United States 
that was the isolationist country and 
it was not the U nited States that was 
followed in resisting the Nazis. After 
the appeasement of Nevi lle 
Chamberlain in the beginning of 

Hitler's reign, Winston Churchill 
was installed as prime minister and 
he urged resistance against Nazi 
Germany. It was British and French 
troops who first resisted the Nazi 
blitzkreig. It was Great Britain's 
fleets that engaged the Third Reich's 
navy and British commandos who 
mounted covert operations in 
Norway to attack Nazi rroops. This 
is all befOre the United States came 
into the war. Great Britain and 
Winston Churchill were the bastion 
against azi Europe, and the United 
States followed Great Britain's 
example of resistance. The rest of 
tl1e world was already at war with 
Japan and Hitler before the United 
States decided to join the effort. The 
United States followed the world 
into war, and it is a very "America 
First" rcvision of history your author 
perpetuates.

Culture: Europeans resist U.S. influence 
continued from page 6 

culture we have furthers the dan-
ger that our culture will never be 
our own. 

Undeniably, the Irish have let 
much of the United States' cultural 
influence invade their borders. 
However, Irish culture maintains a 
strong influence on the population. 
Traditional music sessions can be 
found every night. Irish dances are 
still boasted to be among the 
world's best parries, complete with 
bottomless kegs and fei sty Iri sh 
women. More subtly, the Iri sh do 
not succumb to most American-
English dialects and mock us as 
"bngers" when we refer to the toi-
lets as "restrooms." Some of the 
Irish arc remarkabl y hard to under-

stand, even when you get past the 
accent', merely because they hold to 
their own dia lect and slang, much 
of which comes from direc t transla-
tions of Irish Gaelic. It is quite 
clear that the Irish will not let 
themselves become a virmal United 
States culturally, despite the accep-
tance of some U.S. commercial 
influence. 

The ame can be said of almost 
every European country. If you 
think for one second that France 
and Germany are going to allow 
their rradi tions to dissipate in light 
of caramel frapuccinnos, you might 
as well call Joe Watson a champion 
of popular tudent opinion. No, 
Europeans nrc quite able to keep 
tl1eir cu lmres intact. 

However, the same cannot be 
said of us. Our fledgling culture is 
in great danger of never being 
owned by the people who continu-
ally create it. Often pride in one's 
COUJltry comes from history and 
tradition. We have little history and 
our traditions are being shared 
world-over before they can be given 
a chance to be called American. 

So this Thanksgiving, I am 
thankfu l for Thanksgiving itself, 
one of the few bastions of American 
culture that is solely America's. It 
has become one of the few things 
that separate us from the mass cul-
ture lhat has preceded our arrival to 
the European countries. Oh, and 
I'Ill tl1ankful for "The Simpsons," 
too.

UC to take action 
on Los Alamos 

Berkeley 
sex tent 

shut down By NOAH GRAND 
Daily Bruin (UCLA) 

( -VI/IRE) LOS GELES· 
UC President Ri chard C. 
Atkinson pledged to "take deci-
sivt: action" in response to multi-
ple federal investigations at Los 
Alamos I ational Laboratory. 

In a statement released on 
ov. 29, Atkinson said he was 

"very concerned" about recent 
all egations of theft and cover· 
ups at the UC-managed nuclear 
lab. 

"We intend to find our what 
occurred, correct any deficiencies 
and discipline anyone who has 
engaged in improper activity," 
Atkinson said. 

T he University of California 
oversees the operations of three 
national laboratories - Los 
Alamos, Berkeley and Livermore 
- for the Department of Energy 
and the National uelear 
Security Admi nistration. 

An internal lab document 
leaked to the non -partisan 
Project on Government 
Oversight listed over $1.3 million 
in lost and stolen computers, 
power supplie and other equip-
ment in fiscal year 2001. 

There are no suspects in any 
of the incidenrs of theft, and no 
arrests have been made, accord-
ing to lhe document. Atki nson 's 
statement places the value of 
unlocated items at a lower num-
ber - slightly over $1 milliQn. 

Because computers arc miss-
ing from the lab, wh ich is respon-
sible for maintaining the safety of 
U.S. nucl ear weapons, POGO is 
concerned that national security 
has been breached. 

" \Vhenever you have comput-
ers going Out the door, you've got 
a problem, because you don't 
knolV IVhat \Va~ on tho e comput-
ers," said Pete Stockton, a se1l1or 
investigator for POGO. 

Atkinson said it is up t indi-
ViUlHlls to mai11lain national secu-
rity at the hlb, and anyone break-
ing that tru t will be punished. 

"There will be zero tolerance 
for any level of illegal ac tivity by 
tho e entrusted with safeguarding 
our national security," Atkinson 
said. 

Lab press aide Jim 
Danneskiold said there is no 
record of any c1as ified computers 
being missing or stolen. 

Los Alamos uses methods of 
counting its inventory that arc 
common within the federal gov-
ernment and in compliance with 
federa l guideli nes, sa id UC press 
aide Jeff Garberson. 

[n ad diti on to the D.O.E. 
investigation of missing invento-
ry, the FBI is investigating 
whether employees have made 
unauthorized purcha es with lab 
funds. 

The University of Cal ifornia is 
currently reviewing its policy to 
prevent these purchases, accord-
ing to Atkinson!; statement. 

Stockton, who was a special 
ass istant on security matters for 
Energy ecretary Bill Richardson 
during the Clinton administra-
tion, said the current investiga-
tions could jeopardize the 
U ni versity of California's lab 
managel11ent contract. 

The University of California 
has managed Los Alamos since 
1943; its current contract to run 
the lab lasts lIDtil September 2005. 

Group aimed to 
give hands~on 

instruction 
By R. TYLER HILLMAN 

Daily Californian (UC Berkeley) 
(U-WIRE) B 'RKELEY, Cal if. 

- Horny high jinks hit UC 
Berkeley on Nov. 25 when students 
manned a makeshi ft sexual infor-
mation center on campus. 

Students camped our next to 
the "Tent of Consent" alongside a 
mattress for hands-on learning 
about sexual practices until UC 
poli ce asked t11em to vacate thei r 
location adjacent to vVheeler Hall. 

"We had an informational table 
with books that coul d provide sexu-
al information - we had condoms 
and lube and gloves," said tuxedo· 
clad UC Berkeley senior Ben Van 
Dusen, one of the group's members. 

No passing student "consented" 
to tent treatlllent, but some availed 
themselves of free massages given 
by grou p members on the nearby 
mattress. 

UC police eventua ll y put a halt 
to the mid -morning li bido-fest, 
forcing the group to pack up aftcr 
only an hour of operation. 

"The police askt:d for our pcr-
mit," Van Omen said. "\ Vc tried ro 
get the paperwork, hut we couldn't 
so we had to leave." 

Responses to the expedition 
ranged frol11 "this is totally di sgu~t­
ing" to enthusiastic thumbs up, he 
added. 

The group is not afti li3ted with 
any ca mpus health organizations.

Rezzies: 
UCSD will 
compete at 

nat'l summit 
contintU!d from page I 

Vogel said UCSD has not sub-
mitted a bid for such an award for 
the past six years. As the winner of 
this year 's Program of the Year 
award, UCS D will go on to com-
pete at the National Association of 
College and University Residen ce 
Halls confe rence. The NACURH 
summit will be held on May 21 
through 25 at North Carolina State 
University. 

The Rezzies is a very elaborate 
ceremony, Vogel said . 

"The Price Center is tran s-
formed inw this elaborated deco-
rated place," Vogel said . "Last year, 
there were even two fountains pre-
sent at the ceremony." 

Gallagher sa id such effort is 
what makes the Rezzies progra III 
worthy of the award. 

"I would say that it is appropri-
ate that this program received this 
honor because it reflects the ti me 
and effort put into it by res idential 
life employees," Gallagher said. 

Gallagher went on to say that 
most of the RAs at UCSD are 
highly motivated and qualified 
individuals. H e also noted that it 
was ironic to receive this award so 
close to the firing of several Earl 
Warren College RAs . 

"! do not feel that it was han -
dled fa irly or appropri ately in any 
way," Gallagher said . 

Residenti al life officia ls at 
UCSD could not be reached for 
comment.

continued from page I 
to have reached an agreement that 
we believe recognizes their quality 
service," said Judith W. Boyette, 
associate vice president for human 
resources and benefits at the 
University of California. 

According to Dan Wyman, a 
labor relations specialist at UCSD, 
there were also "a couple of mall 
language changes made to the 
agreement." 

According to UC officials, the 
speedy negotiation process was duc 
to the willingness to cooperate and a 
spirit of collaboration on both sides. 

A spokesperson from FUPOA 
was not available for comment. 

"We greatly appreciate the pro-
fessionalism that the union's chief 
negotiator and campus representa-
tives brought to each bargaining 
session and their commitment to 
resolving differences collaborative-
Iy," said Peter M. Chester, the uni-
vers ity's chief negotiator. 

The new contract will be in 
effect until Sept. 30, 2005, when it 
will be fully renegotiated. The 
contract will be closed 011 all issues 
until tha t time, with the exception 
of wages and a few other items, 
which will be negotia ted once each 
following year. 

"Each year, the parties have a 
right to negotiate on wages," 
Wyman said. 

UC officials and police officers 
alike are sati sfied with both the 
successful negotiation process and 
the new contract. 

"I'm glad that the university took 
the time to sit down with us and 
work out a deal," said]ohn Smart, a 
UC police officer. "It shows their 
concern about public safety on cam-
pus, and I hope we have more posi-
tive agreements in the future."

Tis the season 

A s college students, most of us spend much of the extra cash we earn on our tuition and textbooks, leaving few options when it comes to shopping for the holi-days. Luckily, t11ere are more choices out there than 
you might think. For those of us who can't afford to shop at 
Bath & Body Works, Macy's, Tower Records and The Good 
Guys, there are some stores that will offer similar products at 
more student-frien~ly prices. Creating your own gifts can also 
be an option if you don't feel like giving a store-bought gift. No 
matter what your budget, you should be able to find a way to 
get everyone on your list a present this holiday season. 

Target, Wal-Mart and K-mart are likely to be the first three 
stores that come to mind when it comes to cheap gifts. These dis-
count stores carry a variety of low-cost gifts including candles, 
jewelry, videos, books, picture frames, lotions, soaps, stuffed ani-
mals, art supplies, music, movies and clothing. You can even shop 
online from all of these stores if you don't have time to get out. 
Cheaper alternatives to these stores, such as Ross and Marshalls, 
have smaller selections but bener prices for those on a tight bud-
get. You will find a wide variety of items, such as clothes, journals, 
picture frames, photo albums and kitchenware that were never 
sold at retail stores. There won't be an ample suppl y of every 
item, so it will be a bit harder to find what you want. 

However, if you're willing to dig in and search hard, you may 
be able to discover some great finds. Anyone with a Costco card 
will know that plenty of great 
gifts can be found there as 
well. One item that's sure to 
be useful to students is calling 
cards. Sprint sells packages of 
10 cards at around 4.2 cents 
per minute. Even if you don't 
have ll\embership, you ,night 
be able to tag along with a 
friend or parent who does. 

Cheap CDs and DVDs 
can be found at Best Buy, and 
anyone looking for jewelry, 
cosmetics or hair accessories 
can check out Claire's bou-
tiques. You might be sur-

" Target, Wa1~Mart, 
and K~mart are 

likely to be the first 
three stmes 

far cheap gifts. II 

prised at what else you might find there, including photo clips, 
cuddle pillows and trinket boxes. 

If you're looking for cheap knick-knacks. Pacific Beach and 
Mission Beach are the places to shop. Another place to check 
out would be University Avenue in Hillcrest, home to book. and 
clothing stores. Unique and useful gifts can also be found at 
COSt Plus , where you're sure to find special gifts that can be 
used to decorate dorm roomS and apartments and cook 'deli-
cious meals. Sale items should be able to fit right budgets. 

Those searching for alternative gifts don't have to look far 
for options. Buffalo Exchange, an award-winning vintage cloth-
ing store, has stores in Paci fie Beach and Hillcrest. It offers a 
wide selection of hip new and used clothing. ,The selection 
includes clothes from J. Crew, Gap. Banana Republic, 
Abercrombie & Fitch and Polo Jeans. but at more affordable 
prices. There is a good chance you may find a]. Crew top for 
$9.50, a Limited skirt for $15 or a pair of Candies tennis shoes 
for $12. There is also a selection of footwear and handbags. 

If you're especially short on cash, this may be the place to 
shop if you have some clothes you'd like to get rid of. 
Employees at the store will select the items they can resell, and 
you will receive 35 percent in cash or 50 percent in store cred-
it. Just remember to wash your clothes first. In addition, the 
store also sells incense, shampoo, magnets, houseware, nail pol-
ish and sunglasses. Gift certificates are also available if you can't

Sperm: It's good for your mood 
New study shows that sex can keep women happy 

By JENNIFER ROGERS 
The Daily Aztec 

(San Diego State University) 

(V-WIRE) - A recent study 
indicate that sell may not o nly be 
sexually stimulating for women, but 
sperm may also be responsible for 
keeping women in a good m ood . 

Nearly 300 undergraduate 
females were recruited by Gordon 
Gallup, a psychology professor at 
State Univers ity of New York at 
Al bany, to participa te in a s tudy on 
the effect of sperm on a woman's 
mood. The women answered sur-
vey questions about their sex lives, 
including questions on the amount 
of sell they have and how long it 
has been since their las t sexual 
encounter. 

Gallup also administered a Beck 
Depression Inventory test, a stan-
dard questionnaire used by many 
researchers, to assess the women's 
mood . 

Gallup'S results indicated that 
women who did not use condoms 
were significantly happie r than 
those abstaining &om ex or using 
condoms. The results also indicat-

ed that women who were having 
regular, unprotected sex fe lt worse 
the longer it had been since they 
stopped having sex. The same was 
not true for those women who reg-
ularly wore condoms. 

Since completing t he initial 
study, Gallup has replicated it on a 
larger sca le, using 700 women. The 
results for the second study also 
indicated that semen could have a 
positive effect on a woman's mood. 
Gallup attributes the mood 
enhancement to various hormones 
found in ejaculate. 

Dr. Winifred Cutler, best 
known for her discovery of 
pheromones in 1986, told 
Salon. com in a July 2002 online 
interview that the good mood felt 
by women in a sexual relationship 
has to do more with intimacy than 
bare lovemaking. 

Contrary to Cutler's belief, 
Gallup maintains that intimacy did 
not confound the results of his 
experiment. Sti ll , Gallup is quick to 
acknowledge that his resul ts are 
not set in stone. 

"Simply having sex cannot 
account for their relative happi-

ness," Ga llup told Reuters Healtll 
in an onl ine article published in 
November 2001. 

Critics of Gallup's theory main-
tain that his resul ts cannot be con-
clusive because th ere are too many 
"confounding variables." In other 
words, there are toO many other 
elements that could contribute to a 
woman 's happiness besides regular 
exposure to semen via unprotected 
sex. 

Many female snldents a t San 
Diego State University say women 
are more likely to be in a good 
mood because of a close, intimate 
relationship ratller than from the 
sperm itself. 

"I think intimacy in a relation-
ship would make a girl happier 
than exposure to a guy's semen," 
said freshman Allison Poirier. 

Senior Tiffany RQsales said she 
agrees with th e notion that a 
woman's happiness has more to do 
with a relationship between two 
people. 

"Women can have unprotected 
sex and sti ll be in a bad mood the

one they like," she said. 

Some in the health community 
fear Gallup'S snrdy may be sending 
the wrong message to college-aged 
women, arguing that this snrdy 
may be advoca ting unprotected 
sex. According to a recent survey of 
8,5 00 undergraduates at Harvard

24 percent said they Ilever use con-
doms. 

In light of studi es such as

dangers of unprotected sex. 

"Condom usc is vcry impor-

si n of [sexually transmi tted dis-
casesl and in preventing pregnan-
cy," aid Rita Ruhter, a heal th 

e~lu ca tor at Stud ent H ta l th 
Ser vices at SDSU. 

In his defense, Gallup sa id that 
advocating unprotected sex is the 
last thing he wants to do . 

«We are not advocating that 
peopl e absta in from using con-
doms," Gallup told the 101'01110 fflr

'\c,llic l11 ll' Scnate linnll y approved

. \t the s t ~ rt of the Di"islon II era 
In September 1000, L1eSD

F,lrl Fdwards sa id, "IThc move to

Ind eed, the move has pl ac,," 
l leSD in octter company and has 
prcl\"l dcd for hetter competition . 

CSJ) no\\" co mpetes in the CCAA , 
whICh i ~ w rnposed of 12 schools. 

" lin Dil'ision Ill ). most reams 
\\,o trld play several tough oppo-
nents , but would w:llk all over the 
rest o f the teams on thei r sched-
ules ," C rosse aid. "Now, when we 
play CCAA opponents, it's a barrie 
every time ." 

/';s Elr as rivalries go, many indi-
vidua l sports have developed their 
own rivalries. T he women's volley-
b:lll team has developed a rivalry 
wi th Cal State San Bernardino, and 
th e women's soccer team has been 
pcrenni 'lily clashing with Cal Poly 
Pomon,\' On the whole, UCSD has 
started to develop a rivalry with 
UC Davis, but wi th the possible 

departure of UC Davis fo r Division 
I in 2004, it appe:1rs that ri va lry's 
days are limited. 

. ,\ lost teams have had a ro.ugher 
ti me compeli ng in D ivi,io n II. In 
the 1998-99 season, the UCS D 
men's basketball team posted a 
record of 20-5 , bu t went just 4-23 
JJ1 its fi rst yea r of Division II com-
petition. 

Famili ar ity with the other oppo-
nents i something that 's debatable. 
, ea rly every athl ete at UCS D will 
be able to rattle off tile familiar list 
of CAA opponents, but can fans' 

"1\l any IUCSD fansl may not 
know our CM opponents like 
t hey know Divi sion J schools," 
Grosse said when asked to compare 
Division III opponents to those of 
U CSD' current conference, "But I 
think overall , fans identify better 
with these [CCM] schools." 

The CCAA is composed of two 
U C schools (Davis and UC D), one 
private school located in Arizon:1 
(Grand Canyon) and nine CSU 
schools (Chico State, Sonoma Statt!, 
San Franci co State, CSU Stanislaus, 
CSU Bakersfield, CSU Los Angeles, 
CSU Dominguez Hills, Cal Poly 
Pomona and CS U San Bernardino). 

In contrast to th e athleti cs 
department, the makeup of the 
CCM has led some students to 
question whether or not UCSD 

belongs in the conference. After 
UC Davi s leaves, the conference 
wi ll be composed almost entirely of 
Ca lifornia State Unive rsity schools 
- except UCSD and Grand 
Canyo n. 0 what' the problem 
with that? 

Official s at UC Davis have cited 
the "pee r insti tutions" issue as o ne 
of the largest fac tors in deciding to 
move to Division I. Though UC 

" UCSD is viewed by 
other Division III 
schools as Goliath 

competing against little 
Davids ,II 

- Joseph Watson, UCSD vice 
chancellor of Academic Affairs 

Davis has enjoyed numerous suc-
cesses at the Division II level, 
including five Sears DirectOrs' 
Cups, it has not been able to sustain 
competition with schools it identi-
fies with on more than just an ath-
letic level. The one exception in the 
CCAA has been UCSD. Both UC 

Davis and UCSD are large public 
research instinltions with similar 
enrollments, similar faculty, similar 
research and similar students. Both 
draw from the top 12 ,5 percent of 
California high school graduates 
and atuac t world-renowned pro-
fessors and researchers, 

Some other schools tha t both 
UC Da,~s and UCSD can consider 
peer instinltions in the region are the 
rest of the UC system, the 

niversity of Washington, USC and 
Stanford University, \Vhat some 
view as a more complete list of 
UCSD's peer institutions can be 
found in the membership directory 
of the Association of American 
Universities, "founded in 1900 to 
advance the international standing of 
U,S, research universities." The 
AAU includes schools like Yale, 
Stanford, Duke and Columbia, 

Though the MU was founded 
on academic principle, the athletics 
prograJ11S of its member schools fol-
Iowa distinct parrern. Only two have 
Division n athletics programs: 
UCSD and UC Davis, which is soon 
to be a Divi sion I school. Of the 62 
members of the MU, over 40 have 
Division I ath letics programs, and a 
handful of East Coast AAU schools 
compete at the Division IT! level. 

With the recent approval of a 
fee increase by UC Davis students 

to suppOrt the move, the funlre of 
the UC Davis athletics program 
looks all but certain. But wh at 
about UCSD 's? Though UCSD 
has nOt won a Sears Cup at the 
Division 11 level, it has fini shed in 
the top four in every year since the 
program moved up from Di vision 
III. UCSD's enrollment is far b rg-
er than the average Division II 
enrollment - in fact, it's large r 
than the average Diyision r enroll -
ment. And UCSD can hardly con-
sider Cal State Stani Iaus or an y of 
the other Cal State schools i ~ its 
current conference to be peer insti -
tutions . 

Through tile move to Di vision 
IT, UCSD has been :lble to jo in a 
conference that provides consistent 
scheduling, but ha s much e l c 
changed since the days of Divis ion 
III? Though fan support for UCSD 
athletics has been much improved 
since the move up, do fans reall y 
care about playing Cal State 
schools that they h:lve virtually 
nothing in C0111mon with ? Is 
Division 11 the best division for 
UCSD's athleti cs program' 

Part two: What is the best fit for 
UCSD athletics? See Dec. 5th's 
issue of the Guardian to find 
answers to this question and others.

behind first-place USD, 

Ice Hockey 
After starting their season 0-3, 

the Tritons have surged back with 
several Ivins, all in the hope of cap-
turing their fourth-consecutive 
league championship. 

The Triton hockey team faced 
its greatest challenge of the season 
in mid-November when UCSD 
travel ed to Washington to face four 
schools in four days. The Tritons, 
who have been struggling to come 
together as a team, found their 
chemistry early 10 win four in a row. 

The first game against Walla 
Walla University saw the Tritons 

come Ollt flat. After an inspired 
speech by the coaching taff, the 
TrilOns responded, scoring three 
goals in a J 5 -second span in the 
second period en route to a 12-6 
victory. 

The next night, the Tritons took 
on Boise State in a game that was 
close until UCSD finally capita l-
ized on one of the many chances it 
had in the first period, The Tritons 
continued to pressure Idaho, and 
UCSD jumped out ro a 4-0 lead 
and held on tight, fini shing the 
game wi th a 7 - I win , 

The third game of the trip was 
against Gonzaga. The Tritons' spir-
ited play earned them a 7-0 win. 

The Tritons then faced their 
toughest opponent on the trip in 
University of Idaho. UCSD busted 
out to a 6-1 lead at the end of the 
second period, and with a final 
score of9-2, the Tritons left the icc 
with a six-game winning streak. 

Since that winning streak, the 
Tritons have improved their record 
to 8-4, with eight games left to play 
in their season. 

Sailing Team 
The sloops crew of the UCSD 

sailing team competed in the 
Southern Sloop Eliminations and 
the Sloops Paci fic Coast 
Championshjps in October. In the 
event, UCSD qualified third and 
was able to go on to the champi-
onship. UCSD earned a sixth-place 
overall finish on the west coast. 

On Oct, J 1 through OCt. 13, the 
team arrended the Stoney Burke 
Intersectional at Treasure Island in 
San Francisco, This year's UCSD 
varsity sailing team consists of senior 
Rob Grant and Tori Pinto, who is in 
his first year in the A division, as well 
as first-years Sean Anderson and 
I-leather Martinelli in the B division, 
Grant and Pinto took second place 
in one race. Anderson and Martinelli 
had a notable first college regatta, 
placing fOllrtll overall in the B divi-
sion. Overall, the varsity team took 
lOth place, JUSt behind UC Santa 
Barbara by three points, 

The UCSD sailing tcam then 
hosted the PClYRA Frosh Soph 
Regatta on Oct. 19 and 20. This 
was the first event hosted by 
UCSD this season and the first run 
by this year's team captai ns, Chris 

Nilsen and Ryan McDonell . 
For the first time in the team's 

history, an all-women's varsity team 
competed, consisting of Martinell i, 
Lauren Bailey, Ashlee Goldsmith, 
Laura Stevens and Pinto. 

Women's RU2by 
UCSD succesSfully hosted the 

fifth annual Scrum by the Sea tour-
nament on ov. 2 and 01'. 3. The 
Scrum is the team's first competition 
of the year and generall y sets a good 
precedence for the remainder of the 
season. This year, the UCSD team 
finished in first place, and it did not 
lose a game over the course of the 
two-day tournament. The women 
were pleased to echo the results of 
last year's Scrum, where they were 
also tmdefeated. Jessica Venturi and 
Tina Evangelou led the onslaught by 
scoring most of the team's points, 
and strong kicking by Kirstin Hartos 
further boosted UCSD to victory. 

SU~~f}::~ational champi-
on UCSD Surf Team is back in top 
form this year, with solid showings 
at its first two competitions. After a 
lackluster season last year, UCSD's 
surfers are determined to rekindle 
the energy of previous years , Led 
by captains Aaron apier and Clint 
Edwards, the season began with the 
team taking third place in the first 
National Scholastic Surfing 
Association Event in Ventura, 
Calif., earlier this quarter. 

On Nov. 2, the surf team hosted 
the second event of the NSSA sea-
son at Black's Beach in La Jolla , The 
surf team backed up irs thjrd place 
finish in Ventura with a solid second 
place result, which places UCSD in 
second place in the conference 
standings and as the highest-ranking 
four-year university in the NSSA. 

Water Ski Team 
Early in the quarter, the UCSD 

water ski team placed second at the 
Western Conference Regional 
Championship in Bakersfi eld, Calif., 
qualifying the Tritons to compete in 
Division lA at nationals. This was 
the first time in the history of the 
team that UCSD has qualified for

Fall season 
athletics 
brought 

playoff thrills 
pum's 
points .. :t:;t 'i~' 

Anu Kumar 

A s the 10th week rolls around and fall quarter finals near, students will begin locking 
themselves in their rooms (as usual) 
and stop thinking about the parties 
Jnd TJ . Oh wait, this actually began 
during week one of the quarter when 
people gor to UCSD. 

So it's obviou the anno phere 
here ha~n 't changed much during 
this tirst quarter of the year. The 
lifestyle and mentality of this campus 
hasn't really moved away from the 
let's-hit-the-books attinlde to the 

least-~obe r-ol1e-drives attitude. 
Ilowcver, the unchanged atmos-
phere isn't bad in all aspects; the 
usual success of UCSD fall season 
athletic teams is certainly pleasing (at 
lea t to the handful of us that care). 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team provided much of the fall's 
exci tement when it went 15 -3-1 
over the course of the season. The 
Tritons could have given UCSD 
even more excitement had they pre-
vailed in penalty kicks over UC 
Davis in the second round of the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships, but the 
team will just have to start a new 
string of national titles next year. 

On the other side of the spec-
trum, the mens squad did not disap-
point its fans this fall . The Tritons 
advanced to the postseason after 
they won the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association South Division 
over Cal Poly Pomona. 

In cross country, the men nar-
rowly missed out on a chance to 
return to the NCAA Championship 
meet when they finished fourth at 
regionals. The women's team, how-
ever, represented UCSD when it 
made its first-ever appearance at 
nationals on Nov. 23. 

Women's volleyball followed its 
2001 season when the Tritons 
advanced to the Elite Eight with a 
strong year in 2002. UCSD's season 
saw its biner rivalry with Cal State 
San Bernardino advance to another 
level \vith the Coyotes and Tritons 
playing three heated contests. 

Finally, there is the men's water 
polo team, which hasn't finished its 
season yet. The Tritons are still in 
contention for the national title 
after they accepted the Western 
Water Polo Association 
Championship crown at its own 
Canyonview Pool with a win over 
UCSD's water polo rival, LMU. 

These teams only continued 
their usual strong performances this 
fall. The dominance of women's 
soccer and men's water polo has 
become a tradition (which would 
make it UCSD's only tradition). 

Maybe we'll start to see a change 
in the winter. Maybe the atmos-
phere around campus will begin to 
provide some excitement. Or maybe 
the men's and women's basketball 
teams, Triton softball squad or the 
baseball team can make the change 
and give us the postseason excite-
ment in the winter that UCSD has 
traditionally seen jn the fall.

mails about his points at odku-
mor@ucsdedu.

Still GOLIATH in DII? 
A look at where Triton athletics have 

been and where they might be headed 

m C Davis recently announced plans to reclassify its intercollegiate ath-letics program from National Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II to Division I. The Aggies could 
begin the four-year transition process in the fall 
of 2003 and will become a full-fledged member 
of Division I in 2007, leaving behind UCSD 
and the rest of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. Information disseminated 
by UC Davis indicates that Division I is by far 
a better fit for the athletics program there. But 
the announced move has some here at UCSD 
questioning whether or not Division IT is the 
best fit for UCSD's athletics program. 

Still fresh in the minds of many senior 
Triton athletes and sports fans at UCSD are the 
days of Division 1II. UCSD began competing 
in Division II athletics just two years ago, in the 
fall of 2000. Prior to that, UCSD competed as 
an independent in Division III. In Division III, 
UCSD dominated the competition in virtually 
every sport. Because of this, UCSD was reject-
ed by area athletic conferences and was forced 
to play an independent schedule. 

In a report outlining the reasons why a move 
to Division II was necessary, Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Joseph Watson said, "UCSD 
is viewed by other Division III schools as 
Goliath competing against little Davids." 

Creating a schedule for each team when 

there were no guaranteed opponents was no 
easy task for Triton coaches. 

According to Associate Athletic Director 
Ken Grosse, "It was very difficult to schedule 
with any sort of consistency [in Division 111]. In 
basketball, we'd have games on a Monday and 
Wednesday of one week, and then Tuesday and 
Thursday of the following week. And then 
there would be no games for two weeks." 

These difficulties in scheduling resulted in 
headaches for the coaches who arranged the 
games, and made it impossible for fans to 
anend games with any sort of regularity. 

In addition to scheduling difficulties, UCSDs 
Division ill teams had a tough time drawing fans 
to games. But it wasn't for their lack of athletic 
talent; a likely cause of disinterest among stu-
dents was the lack of quality opponents. In 1999, 
record attendance was set at the annual basket-
ball Spirit Night. However, it was not the fact 
that UCSD was playing Master's College that 
drew the 3,713 fans to RIMAC Arena. An assis-
tant basketball coach had challenged students to 
break the record in an unusual fashion - he 
pledged to camp out on the roof of RIMAC until 
the anendance record was broken. 

To help alleviate the problems that teams 
were facing, the athletics administration pro-
posed the move to Division II. Following a lot

Men's 
basketball 
opens at 
SDSU 

Tritons hope to 
start off the 
2002~03 season 

with a bang 
By JOE SPANO 

Staff Writer 

In the past two years, since the 
Tritons' moved to Division II, the 
men's basketball team has played the 
Division I San Diego State Aztecs very 
early in its season, creating aero s-
town rivalry for both players and fans 
to enjoy. So fa r, the series record is 2-
0, Aztecs, but on Dec. 2 the Tritons 
will get a chance to make that 2- \ 
when they take on SO U at Cox 
Arena. 

Historically, the Tritons' problem 
hasn't been defense - they've kept the 
Aztecs to fairly average winning scores 
of 80 and 93, respectively - as much 
as it has been offense. UCSD has only 
put up scores of 48 and 53 in its two 
previous meetings against SDSU. 

Lone senior on the team J ody 
Woods will be looking to improve on 
his performance in last year's game, 
where he posted 13 total points and 
grabbed four defensive rebounds. 
Jordan Watkins, the only sophomore 
on the team, will also be looking to 
post even stronger numbers than his 
seven points and four rebounds from 
last year's game. 

In addition to these strong perfor-
mances, the rest of the team, comprised 
of six juniors and eight freshman, all 
hope to put up solid numbers, especial-
ly where the scoreboard is concerned. 

UCSD's low shooting percentage 
proved to be costly during its previous 
games against SDSU. Last year, the 
Tritons posted a below-average 35.8 
percent, while the Aztecs shot 67 .8 
percent. In 2000, UCSD posted an 
even lower·32.1 percent. 

After the Tritons game on Dec. 2, 
UCSD will play Grand Canyon 
University at home on Dec. 4.
