Gregory: 
On Iraq 
and more 

BY JOHN BRICE 

"The Iraqi-Iran war is a 
direct result of American 
foreign policy," said human 
rights activist Dick Gregory 
following his speech at 
Mandeville Auditorium last 
night. 

Gregory, w hose appear-
ance here was spon ored by 
the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee, discussed 
issues including drug abuse, 
media control, health food 
and the manipulation of the 
world by American elites. 

Opening his speech with 
several racial jokes, Gregory 
went on to caIl the attempted 
rescue of the hostages in Iran 
"a farce." 

"Three American-made 
helicopters are not going to 
fail, especially on the same 
mission," he said. Gregory 
believes the attempt was part 
of a plan that included 
leaving behind in Iran 
$300,000 in Iranian money 
and a notebook containing 
the names of 600 top military 
leaders from the Shah's 
regime. 

"The idea was to make the 
Khomeini regime think that 
America was planning to 
support a counter revolu-
tion," contended Gregory. 
"The American government 
hoped these military leaders 
would be shot by the

Daily Guardian to go 
biweekly in January 

The executive board of The Daily Guardian voted 10-1 
with. on~ abste~ti<?n y~terday to institute twice-weekly 
pu bhcatton begmmng wmter quarter, thereby ending four 
quarters of a daily schedule. 

Issues of no less than 16 pages will be pu blished Mondays 
and Thursdays, the board decided. 

The move is expected to have at least a mar . nal effect on 
the paper's finances, which have been troubled, but the 
C?ncensus of the executive board was that becoming 
biweekly would aJl~w a more thoughtful and analytical 
approach to presentmg news. 

AS debates committee report 
on Daily Guardian operations 

BYDEANHAAS 
SCdWriter 

A proposal to revoke the 
Daily GlUWdia,,'s status as a 
student organization was 
a~ved by the AS oouncil 
eight to five with two 
abstentions at Its meetiD« 
last night. The CounCil 
recommendation now goes to 
Student Organizations 
Director Randy Woodard and 
Vice Chanceltor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage for 
consideration. 

The biJl is the result of an 
investigation i~to the 
Guardia,,'s financial and 
operational procedures led by 
Commissioner of Student 
Welfare Reggie Wiliams. The 
investigation was initiated 

due to AS dissatisfaction 
with an underwrite of 
$15,846 made by the AS to the 
GlUWdio" last June, for year-
end accounting purposes. 
The GlUlJ'dun. technically 
repaid the AS loan the next 
day, but still carries the 
burden of the deficit. ' 

The Council also recom-
mended that the GUllrdilz,, · 
become a weekly publication 
and that the paper be charged 
for ~I accounting and payroll 
services currently performed 
by AS staff members at no 
cost to the paper. 

The Daily Guardia" 
Executive Board voted 
yesterday to change its 
pl,Iblication schedule to 
biweekly beginning winter 

quarter. (See story on page 1). 
Council members in favor 

of the proposal attributed 
their support to financial 
necessity. 

"The AS might . have to 
liquidate its assets in order to 
carry the Daily Guardilz"," 
Williams said. 

Woodard, who is aIao the 
AS advisor, commented that 
the recommendations were 
"sound" and based on 
extensive research. He added 
that the AS could not afford 
to carry over a Guardia" 
deficit from this year. 

"If the Guardia" deficit is 
$35,000 (a figure Woodard 
estimates) at the end of this 
fiscal year the AS will begin

Muir fire alarms 
at epidemic level 
Costs taxpayers hundreds 

BY RANDY HILL 
Staff Writer 

It's getting to the point 
where dorm residents at 
Muir College aren't taking 
their fire alarm seriously 
anymore. 

There have been ix false 
fire alarms this quarter -
three just last weekend. And 
student compliance with 
evacuation procedures seems 
to be getting less and less 
with the near-weekly ritual. 

In addition to inconvenien-
cing the approximately 300 
students who must leave 
their rooms, the mo tly 
night -ti me alarms cost 
hundreds of dollars spent to 
bring fire and police 
department personnel to the 
cene. 
According to San Diego 

Fire Department spoke men, 
each alarm i automatically 
answered by thre engine 
companies and a battalion 
chief. Each run cost 
taxpayers $1000. 

Another danger cau ed by 
the rash of false alarms is the 
potential for injury to those 
trying to evacuate the 
building. 

Ten people were trapped in · 
a Tioga Hall elevator during 
one of last weekend's false 
alarms. According to UCSD 
physical plant represent-
tives, the elevator door 
mechanism jammed while 
opening onto a floor. 

And it took maintanence 
crews over an hour to explain 
to the trapped residents how 
to get out of the elevator. 

During a fire alarm, a key 
switch is normally turned to 
bring the elevators to the first 
floor, in order to prevent 
evacuees from being brought 
to a burning floor by the 

elevator. 
The recent rash of false 

alarms has cause many 
students to ignore the alarms 
or to evacuate at a very slow 
pace. 

"Nobody seems to care 
anymore. If there were a real 
fire, they'd all burn up," 
observed one student. 

But Erik Mellby, Muir 
Assistant Re ident Dean, 
claims that "we can clear the 
whole building in 10 to 15 
minutes. We go in with our 
master key and make sure 
everyone is out." 

Fire Captain Simpson of 
Fire Station #35, near the 
Mesa Apartment, added 
that, "the per on in charge of 
each dorm has done a good job 
of evacuating the building." 

Mellby remind re idents 
that those who refuse to 
evacuate can be charged a ten 
dollar fine. 

Setting off a fire alarm can 
have serious consequences. 
At tl)e very lea t, a student 
can be uspended from school 
and char~ with a $500 fine, 
says MelTby. 

Lt. Lloyd Turner of the 
UCSD Police Department 
points out that initiating a 
false alarm is a mi de meaner, 
a violation of Penal Code 148. 
"We have in the past 
presented these case for 
prosecution," Turner says. 

Simpson has ~trong words 
for offenders: "If we catch 
one of these persons who 
pulled one of these boxes, 
he (will be) in serious 
trou ble ... (The false calls) 
leave the citizens unprotec-
ted." 

Man wearing no clothes 
causes ruckus at Cluster 

When a "good looking guX 
wearing shades and sandles ' 
walked into the Humanities 
Library last night around 8 
pm, he caused quite a ruckus. 

The fact that he was 
wearing o"ly sunglasses and 
sandles may have had 
something to do with it. 

"I thought there was a riot 
when I walked in here," said 
Larry Grant, who was 
working at the circulation 
desk soon after the wOl!ld-be 
patron entered the library. 

According to some 
witnesses, the man walked 
over to the card catalog as 
though he was looking up a 
book. He then strolled around 
the first floor library area 
while students on the upper 
study level applauded and 
cheered. 

"I think it was a bet ," said 
one wide-eyed woman. "I 
mean, if he'd only wanted to 
get attention, he wouldn't 
have worn the shades." 

Grant said that he heard 
after the incident that "there 
were five cases of beer riding 
on the prank." 

Later in the evening, an 
anonymous caller telephoned 
The Daily Guardian and 
claimed that the prank "was 
another J House (Tioga Hall, 
Muir Coll~e) feat .... just a 
member of J House doing his 
thing." . 

"Everybody got a good 
break from studying," Grant 
said. "It's the most 
excitement 'we've had here 
since the last bomb threat.

lJJJy.iktL"bicks Carter 

Reagan's victory 
will boost the Right 

BY TOM HAYDEN 
Realizing that it's 

officiall y bad t as te to 
sound shrill or personal 
about the possibility of a 
Reagan presidency, let me 
say that I like Ronald 
Reagan, view him as a 
"populist" in his own way, 
and find his company 
curiously enjoyable. 

We have lived as 
neighbors on nearby 
"ranches" in the Santa 
Ynez Valley for several 
years, and I don't find him 
especially objectionable. 
Of murse, he does use 
zoning loopholes to pay 
virtually no local property 
taxes while my family paid 
$6,500 last yesr, but he 
doesn't believe in govern-
ment and we do, 80 why 
complain_ 

In my one lengthy 
mnvenation with Reagan, 
late one evening last year 
when we found ourselves 
on the same flight from 
San Francisco to Los 
Angeles, he tried his 
honorable best to convince 
me that I should follow his 
own evolution from left-
liberal to mnservative. I 
agreed with much of his 
criticism of government 
bureaucracy. I was 
fascinated by his mm· 
ments on the elitism and 
oovertness of the 19408 
Hollywood left . What 
disturbed me was that I 
oouldn't get a straight 
answer to the simplist of 
questions. If Reagan 
opposes bureaucracy so 
much, why does he focus 
his fire only on govern-
ment and not on the waste 
and secretiveness of big 
corporations, and why 
only on government social

programs but never the 
FBI, the CIA or the 
Pentagon? 

The problem with 
Ronald Reagan is not that 
he's bad, callous or selfish. 
From an archeological 
viewpoint , he is an 
Obsolete Man. 

Because there is no 
viable candidacy repre· 
senting the future, the 
because the Carter status 
quo seems to insupport· 
able , a majority of 
Americans may well 
release their subconscious 
nostalgic impulses and 
vote for the Republican 
version of The Way We 
Were. 

Ronald Reagan was not 
shaped by the 60s like 
Jerry Brown, or the New 
Deal of the 30s like Ted 
Kennedy. He' s not a 
reflectIon of Jimmy 
Carter's New South of 
1959. His consciousness 
was shaped by the Golden 
20s, four political 
generations removed from 
the children of today. He is 
a direct descendent of the 
"Republican Ascendency" 
of Calvin Coolidge and 
Herbert Hoover. 

Ronald Reagan believes 
in ~nboat diplomacy. He 
beheves in dismantling 
government and letting 
loose big corporations to 
mold the world in their 
image. Of course, he is 
capable of compromise, 
and his impulses can be 
restrained by public 
opinion, the medIa and 
Congress. 

But it is dangerous for 
sucn outmoded visions to 
be located in the White 
House. Dangerous to 
Third World oountries, 
dangerous for the arms 
race, dangerous for 
working people and the 
poor , dangerous for 
organizers and activists 

The DaiLy. Guarctia" 

and most dangerous for 
the next generation of 
young people. Even if we 
are spared war and 
repression under Reagan, 
the effect of his benign 
incoherence will be to 
drive the young into 
apathet ic and private 
lives. 

Can anything be done to 
head this off? Yes . 
Between now and Nov. 4 
this disillusioned voter 
can decide to vote for 
Jimmy Carter. That 's 
right, Jimmy Carter. 

It is true that the Carter 
presidency, in overall 
terms, has been such a 
failure that it allows 
Reagan to be the first 
conservative representing 
change. And it is true that 
Carter's policies are 
primarily to blame for the 
defections of liberals into 
the Anderson camp, the 
smaller and more princi-
pled Commoner group or 
Into nihilistic indifference. 

But the larger ·truth is 
that non-votes or Ander· 
son votes are de facto votes 
for Ronald Reagan . 
Assuming a close race, the 
5-10 percent defection vote 
will make the difference in 
big states like New York 
and Cailfornia. 

There are vital margins 
of difference between 
Carter and Reagan; 
support for the Panama 
Canal and SALT treaties, 

recognition of Zimbabwe 
and Nicaragua, backing 
for the ERA, the quality of 
future judicial appoint· 
ments. labor law reform 
versus a "right to work" 
approach, tolerance and 
partical support for 
progressive movements 
instead of repression and 
exclusion. 

Any rational person 
would recognize these 
differences, but politics is 

anythin~ but rational. We 
are wItnesses to an 
election in which Carter is 
counting on a repeat <?f 
1964, but the outcome IS 
likely to be 1965. 

I find that the 1964 and 
1968 presidential elections 
still influence my con-
sciousness - and my 
skepticism - toward 
electoral politics. I don't 
think I'm different from 
millions of dis illus ioned 
voters of the 60s genera· 
tion, less than half of 
whom have either 1» 
thered to register to vote. 

In 1964, in my first vote 
for a presidential candi-
date, I chose Lyndon 
Johnson because of my 
fear of Barry Goldwater. 
We in Students for a 
Democratic Society (SDS) 
adopted the slogan, "Part 
of the Way with LBJ." 

But instead ofJohnson's 
promise of "no wider 

Tharsday, October 23',·1980 

war ," we got napalm, B· 
52s, mill ions of cas ualt ies 
and moral disgrace. When 
1968 came around. millions 
of us refused to support 
Hubert Humphrey as long 
as held upheld Johnson's 
Vietnam policies. I voted 
for him, but wouldn't 
admit it to anyone for 
years afterward. Humph-
rey remained loyal to 
Johnson, and lost 100,000 
votes to Richard Nixon. 

In 1968, we learned the 
consequences of not voting 
for the lesser evil. Not 
suprisingly , . you get the 
greater evil. While I'm not 
sure whether Humphrey 
would have ended the 
Indochina War any sooner 
than Nixon was forced to, 
and while Humphrey's 
economic policies might 
have been a failure, there 
is one thing I am certain of: 
Humphrey would not have 
authorized and carried out 
Watergate. He might have 
dealt with domestic 
radicals harshly, but I 
doubt if there would have 
been a Gordon Liddy on 
the White House parroll 
schem ing to kill Jack 
Anderson. From my point 
of view and my personal 
experience, Watergate 
was the closest thing we 
have ever come to a 
domestic police state, and 
it was only narrowly 
averted.

The increase m Ku Klux 

Klan activities in Southern 
California and the Democra· 
tic Party Candidacy of Tom 
Metzger, the Grand Dragon 
of the Ku Klux Klan, pose a 
serious threat to all working 
people. Metzger and the KKK 
are trying to whip up race 
hatred and pit whites against 
the majQrity of humanity. 
His racist solutions are a 
dead-end strategy and he 
tries to make the victim of 
oppression into the aiminal. 

TheKKK and the Nazis are 
happy in the Democratic 
Party, and this should make 
it clear once and for all that 
working people need their 
own party. The recent 
international ronvention of 
my union, the International 
Association of Machinists, 
went on record for a labor 
party - they refused, despite 
Kennedy's pleas, to endorse 
any candidates (Carter or 
Reapn). 

Tnis is exactly the 
direction we must take, 
toward the formation of a 
labor party based on the trade 
unions in an alliance with 
blacks, women, Chicanos, 

working farmers , students 
and other allies. Such a party 
would be a powerful weapon 
against Klan terror. It would 
field an independent working 
class candidate to run 
against the racist Metzger 
and the big agribusiness 
candidate, Republican Clair 
Burgener. Such a party 
would mobilize the labor 
movement and its allies to 
protect blacks being 
victimized by the Klan, to 
defend undocumented 
workers from the KKK and 
La Migra. It would be our 
pol itical weapon in the plants 
and the yards to help us win 
better contracts. 

I am running as the 
Socialist Workers Party 
(SWP) candidate because 
working· people need an 
alternative to the anti· 
worker policies of Metzger 
and Burgener. There is DO 
"lesser evil" in this race. 
Burgener is as anti-working 
class as Metzger - just more 
sophisticated about it. 

They both oppose union 
organizing efforts and are 
anti-United Farmworkers 
Union. They both support the 
draft and are against the ERA 

for women. They both 
support nuclear power and 
are for increased deporta· 
tions of undocumented 
workers. The SWP is just the 
opposite of these Democratic 
and Republican politicians-
we support the movements 
for social change and all 
struggles against racism, 
sexism and oppression. 

We have to begin now to 
build a broadly based and 
massive movement against 
the KKK. That is the purpose 
of my campaign. We must 
begin to educate the 
overwhelming majority who 
oppose the Klan. My debate 
with Metzger on the "Speak 
Up America" show on Sept. 5 
demonstratively showed the 
opposition to the Klan. The 
studio audience turned the 
scene into an anti-Klan rally. 
I have opened my campaign 
and made it available to 
anyone who is willing to join 
in united opposition to the 
Klan, whether or not they 
agree with all the SWP's 
positions. 

The Democratic Party is 
em bar as sed about Metzger's 
victory in their primary. But 
why should they be

NEWS BRIEFS 

Hostages' release 
may be next week 

LONDON - Iranian 
leaders said yesterday the 
United States appears ready 
to meet their conditions for 
release of the 52 hostages, 
and the Americans could be 
freed as early as next 
Monday, reports from 
Tehran said. 

The indications of progress 
from Tehran were not 
confirmed by US officials in 
Washington, who reacted 
skeptically to some aspects of 
the reports. 

Prime Minister Moham-
mad Ali Rajai reportedly told 
a news conference in Tehran 
the Carter administration 
seems prepared to comply 
with the Iranian demands. 

A member of the Iranian 
parliamentary commission 
studying the hostage issue 
said in the Iranian capital 
that the terms for the 
Americans' release probably 
would be announced Sunday, 
and if the conditions are met 
by the United States "the 
hostages could even be 
released the following day," 

according to the reports 
reaching London. 

Some of the reports named 
that official as commission 
chairman Moussavi Khoeini, 
the Moslem clergyman 
regarded as spiritual leader of 
the young militants holding 
the hostages. Ali Akbar 
Parvaresh, another member 
of the commission, later said 
there was a "great probabili· 
ty" the issue would be 
discussed by the Parliament 
on Sunday. He was reached 
in Tehran by telephone from 
the Associated Press office in 
Beirut, Lebanon. 

Still later, the secretary to 
Ahmed Khomeini , son of 
Iranian leader Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini , said the 
United States has already 
accepted Iran's conditions 
and the host~es would be 
released "soon. ' 

It was not known whether 
the secretary, who also spoke 
by telephone with the AP 
Beirut office, had any special 
access to information on the 
crisis.

CIA agent 
investigated 

WASHINGTON - A 
former CIA covert agent, 
under federal investigation 
for allegedly going to work for 
the Soviet Union, tried 
unsuccessfully to join the 
staff of three government 
committees that oversee US 
intelligence operations, 
government officials and 
other sources said yesterday. 

But law enforcement 
sources said the agent, David 
Barnett, described as in his 
late 30s or early 40s, did do 
part · time work under 
contract for the CIA after he 
came under Soviet control. A 
congressman said a tip from 
the FBI thwarted Barnett's 
efforts to join the House 
intelligence committee staff. 

Sources who asked not to 
be named said a wide range of 
activities by Barnett 
designed to obtain US 
intelligence secrets for the 
Soviets had been the subject 
of a complicated investiga-
tion by the FBI and the 
Justice Department for more 
than a year.

Nuclear power debate raises 
questions of safety, dumping 

Kaku attacks NASSCO management 
BY JOHN BRICE 

"A stronB case can be made 
that NASSCO management 
has been negligent," a 
prominent physicist said 
here Tuesday night. 

Michio Kaku, a teacher at 
New York Citr College, 
charged that NASSCO used 
the workers as "scapegoats" 
to avoid blame for the 
accidents and deaths at a San 
Diego shipyard which builds 
nuclear powered plants for 
the Navy. 

Kaku was speaking at a 
debate with Sidney Langer of 
General Atomic in the Revelle 
Cafeteria on the value of 
nuclear power. 

NASSCO has claimed that 
the workers who were killed 
were in an area they knew 
was not sufficiently 
ventilated. 

Kaku argued that the 
NASSCO case was typical of 
the nuclear industry, and 
took shots at other nucle~r 
ventures. 

"Nuclear power is like a 
beached whale. We should 
put it out of its misery," he 
said. 

He described the San 
Onofre nuclear plant as a 
"laughing stock: accidently 
constructed backwards and 
forced to operate in reverse of 
its design. He presented 

reports claiming the disposal 
of nuclear waste off the the 
San Diego coast. 

33.6 curies of low level 
radioactive waste was 
dumped 215 miles out at a 
depth of 4,415 feet. Waste, 
the federal government 
admits, has been dumped up 
and down the West and East 
coasts, but San Diego has not 
been spotlighted as one sight. 

Kaku cited Livermore, Los 
Alamos and the UCLA 

trainin~ reactor as part ofUC 
system s involvement in the 
nuclear industry. He also 
described the UC system "as 
the most nuclear involved 
university system in the 
world." 

Langer, a member of the 
American Nuclear Society, 
opened the debate contending 
that nuclear energy has 
risks, but argued that all 
types of energy do. 

He stressed the safety 
record of the nuclear 
industry. "There have been 
no deaths or injuries in the 
unbroken safety record 
spanning twenty years," 
Langer said. 

"A minority in America is 
opposed to nuclear energy 
and they are lringing this 
country to its knees." 

Langer cited Southern 
. California Edison as the 

Socialist candidate 
alternative to KKK 
continued from page 2 
direction, are committing 
massive fraud against the 
313,000 people who signed 
petitions to put the SWP 
candidates on the ballot for 
president, vice-president, the 
senate and congress. But 
Brown is having a hard time 
pulling this off, he has had to 
break his own laws. Forty-
four thousand people in San 
Diego County alone signed up 
to put us on the ballot. People 
enthusiastically signed 
petitions to put the socialist 

and anti-Klan candidates on 
the ballot. 

Building a movement 
against the KKK and 
supporting the formation of a 
labor party are crucial 
questions facing all San 
Difl{ans whether or not they 
livem the43rdCongressional 
District. I need your help -
please call me at 234-4630_

SOCIAUST WORKERS 

PARTY CANDIDATE 
FOR CONGRESS 

largest oil burning utility in 
the world, and noted that 
SDG&E is dependent on oil 
for 77 percent of the energy it 
produces. 

Kaku responded that it is 
time that the interest of the 
American people be put 
ahead of the concern for 
profits. He feels that they 
profit hungry oil companies 
are dominating the nuclear 
industry, citing Exxon 
Nuclear and Gulf Atomic as 
examples. 

Kaku also questioned the 
safety record of the nuclear 
power plants. He discussed 
the Rogovin report on Three 
Mile Island. 

The report stated that the 
top half of the reactor was 
within 30 to 60 minutes of a 
melt down. Kaku added that 
once the reactor was shut 
down because "no one could 
think of anything else to do," 
Kaku said , it was accidently 
opened three different times. 

Kaku labeled nuclear 
power as an "unforgiving and 
unnecessary industry." 

The debate which was 
sponsored by the ASUCSD 
was positively receiVed, this 
was reflected by the two 
dozen people who remained 
after the debate to thank both 
of the speakers for a very 
informative evening. 

AS ~

next r.ear at a $10,000 
deficit, ' said Woodard. 

Linda Sabo, Student Body 
Presidents' Council Chair-
woman, expressed concern 
over the Council's action. 
"We must tread very softly 
on this issue," Sabo said. 
"Whenever student govern-
ment gets involved with a 
student newspaper it is very 
nasty and gets out of hand too 
easily." 

She cited a controversy 
over governorship of the 
student newspaper at UC 
Berkeley as an example of 
past conflicts.

When there is absolutely 
nothing else to do, go bowling 

BY WILLIAM HAMILTON 
B~wlers on campus - everyone knows a few. Perhaps 

you re even a bowler yourself. If so, you are no doubt 
a~':Is.tomed to ~ing the brul!t of harsh and unjustified 
cntlcls~ from fair· weather friends , who deride you for 
your enjoyment of what has come to be considered a low· 
class sport. 

Take heart , however. For adjacent to UCSD are 
sanctuaries where the enlightened may take refuge from 
the s~rn of the uninitiated; bowling establishments 
featurmg such marvels of technology as computerized 
scorekeeping, 89-cent hamburgers (truly and endangered 
species in these trying inflationary times), and the sort of 
comraderie which only close personal association . with 
other bowling fanatics and a belly full of beer can foster.

Waterpolo teatn 
rips opponents 
Sweeps Maritime tournament 

BY BEN MARCUS 

The water polo team has 
been on a hot streak lately. 
After returning from a 
successfu I series in Northern 
California (five victories in 
six games), the Tritons went 
on to sweep a two-game set 
over the weekend. 

UCSD. began the stint up 
north With a game against 
UC Berkeley, a team that Wlti 
then ranked topin the nation. 
The Bears mauled their 
visitors in a 12-5 triumph 
although Triton coach Denny 
Harper said "the game was 
by no means a blow-out. 
Berkeley had to earn every 
game they scored." 

From Berkeley the team 
traveled to Vallejo to play in 
the California Maritime 
Invitational. In the first game 
of the tournament the 
Tritons faced Chico State, 
and the Tritons produced a 7· 
6 victory. 

In the second round UCSD 
met minor nemesis San 
Francisco State. The final 
score was UCSD with the 
game !lnd title, 11-5 over San 
FranCISco. 

The final game of the 
tournament Wlti against Cal 
Maritime. Harper said, "We 
overcame some Questionable 
officiating, as the referees 
were doing everything they 
could to keep Maritime in the 

game, but we still managed to 
win 10-7." 

After taking the tourna-
ment laurels, the team 
traveled to San Jose State and 
their large 30 meter pool. The 
size of the pool taxed the 
unaccustomed Tritons, but 
they managed to pull a tough 
12-10 win from the Spartans. 

The momentum from 
Northern California carried 
over into more recent games. 
The Tritons defeated the 
tough Occidental College 
team on their home ground 
13-6, and then destroyed a 
weak Redlands team 26-3. 
leff El1iot, Steve Marks, 
Bobby Finnell and freshman 
goalie Sprout Fontaine 
contributed outstanding 
performances. 

Pleased with the team's 
play, Coach Harper expects 
the members to become a 
virtual machine by the end of 
the season. 

"The overall play of the 
team improves with everx 
game," said Harper. "And If 
everything goes \Veil, we 
have a chance to break the 
school records for most wins 
in a seltion. " 

The Tritons resume 
activity tomorrow with an 
away double-header against 
Loyola at 3:30 pm and LA 
State at 7 pm. 

Friday, Oct 24 after 7 pm 
All day Saturday & Sunday 

We will have A, B & C 
challenge courts, 
and there will be beer, 
soft drinks and juices 
available for purchase.

This is a large (54 lanes) 
newly-refurbished facility 
which feature free child care 
services for league bowlers, a 
huge arcade with a wide 
variety of tw~bit mechanial 
bandits eager to swipe your 
spare change and exception· 
ally generous bartenders who 
know how to pour a stiff 
drink (the hangover is as 
integral a part of bowling as a 
bowler's thumb). 

A word of cau t ion , 
however, is appropriate. Also 
operating within the confines 
of this establishment is the 
Alamo Club, which features 
live country and western 
music nightly and is a haven 
for John Wayne deifiers and 
their bee · hive hairdoed 
cowgirl friends. Persons not 
of this particular persuasion 
have been known to receive 
from the staff a less-than· 
cordial welcome if not 
appropriately attired with 
suitable western garb. 
Contras ting is the arcade 
section, frequented by a 
deviant slice of local dreg 
element , which behaves 
disrespectfully and uncouth-
ly at all times. Frequent 
patrons still anticipate a 
showdown between the two 
cliques.

This alley is by far my 
favorite, both for the livey 
c1ienteIle and for the 
cleanliness and modernity of 
the facilities. Comr.utenzed 

scor~keeping, weI -serviced 
equipment, a comprehensive 
pro shop staffed by 
knowledgable profressionals 
and a host of amenities not 
normally found at other 
alleys set Kearny Mesa Bowl 
apart from the others. It is 
often crowded, though, and 
on weekends the waiting 
period ranges from 20 
minutes to an hour. Even the 
hopelessly inept and clumsy' 
are welcome here, although If 
you aren't a seasoned bowler 
It might be wise to use a 
fictitious name and w~ a

Gregory 
speaks 
continued from page 1 
Khomeini regime, resulting 
in a weakened Iranian 
military," he said. 

"This set the stage for the 
Iraqi-Iran war. America 
hoped to make Iraq a watch 
dog in the Persian Gulf, as 
they once did with Iran," said 
Gregory. 

The main emphasis of 
Gregory's speech was on "the 
importance of people 
themselves" in society, and 
the need for people to "take 
matters into their own hands 
to prevent things from 
getting worse." 

Gregory catltioned the 
audience that "the families 
that have dominated America 
since the ear.}.~·l.gth centurt, 
. the DuPCfnt he Carneg,~ 
and othe • are ju t 
.rnanipulatin h us to th 

~dvantage." •. 
• . This marfipulation wi1l 
continue, said Gregory, 
"until we believe, as 
individuals, that we make a 
difference. " 

The blame for the drugs 
"that are hurting our society 
today" was placed once again 
on the "white elites," who 
Gregory contends developed 
a plan over 70 years ago for 
societal manipulation 
through drugs and other 
means.
