At"UC, a Wider Wage Gap 
Divides Top from Bottom 

Blue-collar workers' 
sal~ries lag other 
systems, while exec 
earnings keep rising, 
union study says. 

By Charles Nguyen 
N EW EDITOR 

Unionized employees at UC cam-
puses are paid les than their counter-
parts in the California State Uhiversity 
and California community colleges, 
according to a study released by one 
of the unions representing them. 

Custodians' wages in the UC sys-
tem are 14 to 26 percent lower than 
CSU pay for similar positions and 
23 to 25 percent lower than commu-
nity college wages. according to the 
American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees, which 
organizes approximately 18,000 cus-
todians, patient-care and food-ser-
vice workers in the UC system. In 
addition, the average maximum sal-
ary of custodians is $13.54 per hour, 
while CSU and community college 
custodians are paid respective average 
hourly wages of $18.34 and $17.59, 
the report stated. 

In contrast, the study reported that 
UC President Robert C. Dynes earned 
more than $423,666 in compensa-
tion last fiscal year, compared to the 
$355,692 earned by CSU Chancellor 
Charles B. Reed and $245,484 earned " 

.. 

by community colleges Chancellor 
Mark Drummond. 

The study is the newest critical 
look at the university's pay practices. 
which began with a an Francisco 
Chronicle article reporting that the 
university paid out more than $870 
million last year in bonuses. 

«It is distressing to see so much 
focus on executive pay when so many 
UC workers and their families are 
struggling daily just to survive:' union 
Local 3299 spokeswoman Celine 
Perez stated in an e-mail. «We want 
the regents to place the same amount 
of focus and energy to the pay of 
workers as they have for the execu-
tives:' 

f.,pproximately $7 million of that 
pot went to high-tier executives. 
Following the article, the UC Board 
of Regents expressed concern over 
the transparency of the university's 
compensation methods. 

«The current policies are difficult, 
unclear, divergent and unorganized," 
Regent Judith Hopkinson said at a 
regents meeting in January. 

Sil)ce then, the board has created 
a task force to explore pay policies, 
called for a systemwide audit and 
pledged to overhaul compensation 
practices. 

The study may seem damning, but 
it used salary figures from the 2004-05 
fiscal year, and did not include wage 
increases implemented in November, 
when the Board of Regents approved

~ketball player and Revelle College jllllior Clint AlIardjoins in on Spirit Week, part of

CONTRIBUTI G WRITlR 

It's Friday night , and when most 
of the universities il) the nation 
are ' gearing up for their weekend 
sporting events, UCSD i adding its 
own flavor to games: the Enerdyne 
Challenge. Solve a complicated 
physics problem, come to the ba -
ketball game and win a TV - the 
challenge's hook. 

What an odd couple: physics-:lnd 
basketball? 

But so goes sporting life at 
UCSD, where the athletics depart-
ment is adapting to an academic and 
research-oriented atmosphere. 

It's not just the challenge - fund -
ed by a $10,000 donation from a bas-
ketball a1umn,:!s - that is bringing 
together the world of academia and 
sports. Melding athletics and academ-
ics is a UCSD mantra that adminis-
trators wish to continue, according to 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Edward J. Spriggs. 

"[ Our st\ldent athletes J are not 
'jocks' just here to play sports and 
do nothing else'," Spriggs said. «Every 
single one of our scholar-athletes is 
here for both reasons and that is a 
t radition we don't want to abandon." 

Spread the Word Around, the Boys Aren't Back in Town 
Paying to get athletes to study is a 

different matter. UCSD remains the 
only NCAA Division II school that 
doesn't award athletic scholarships. 
While the athletics department 
and student ' affai rs office recognize 
that the lack of scholarships deters 
prospective athletes from coming 
to UCSD, limited funds and other 
school priorities hold the university 
back from granting serious schol -
arships, according to Director of 
Athletics Earl W. Edwards. 

The gender gap in 
higher education is 
wider than it's ever 
been, especially for 
UCSD's newest class. 

By Jadyn Snow 
STAFF WRITER 

It might be- every guy's dream, 
but the widening gender gap in 
higher education that began in the 
1980s seems to have no end in sight, 
a .worry of some college officials. 

Female students make up the 
majority at UCSD, comprising a 
record 57 percent of the fresh -
men class and a 52 percent average 
for all undergraduates. Nationally, 
undergraduate females make up 
about 56 percent of students at 
four-year universities, according to 
the U.S. Department of Education. 

The Univer<ity of California has 
a slightly high lverage, with 57.1 
percent of-enr 'es, overall, being 
women.

Female students outnumber males a/ UCSD by 4 percent, slightly lower than the national 
average. Women comprise comprise 57 percent of college students acrass the country. 
at UCSD began as early as the mid-
r980s, but was clearly evident in 
the early 1990s. 

UCSD's tudent Re earch and 
Information Office showed a 
light 51 percent male majority in 

1994. But by 1999, enrMlment of 
women reached 52 percent and has 
remained constant ~ince then. 

The UC system is seeing more 
and more female applicants, with a 
con tantly smaller pool of qualified 
male for the universities to pick 

from, according to Brown: Even 
with on ly slightly higher standard-
ized test scores and comparable 
grades. females have managed to 
overtake males in the UC applicant 
pool 

Over the pa t decade, the uni-
versity ha become more female-
friendly through statewide legi 
lation. including Proposition 209, 
whi h barred discrimination and 
preference by gender. 

Passed in 1996. Proposition 209 

SPORTS 

effectively ended affirmative action. 
Along with Title IX of the fed -
eral Higher Education Act, which 
requires equal spending on both 
male and female sports, the door 
for females opened in higher learn-
ing institutions, Brown stated. 

The gender imbalance could 
manifest before the application 
process. Even as male students 
nationwide continue to do as well 
as their female counterparts, nearly 
12 of every 100 male students d{op 
out s~e time in their high school 
career, compared to only nine of 
every 100 females, the Education 
Department reported. 

Data are mixed in female enroll-
ment in typically male-dominated 
fields. Biology departments have 
seen a decline in female enroll ees 
from 1994 to 2004, though biology 
remains the most popular major 
for females at UC D. Meanwhile. 
economics i now the second most 
popular major for women, nearly 
doubling 111 enrollment from 1994. 

The Department of Education 
estimate a 60 percent female 
majority in higher education by 
2010.

"You don't necessarily have to go 
down the slippery slope ·that a lot 
of people are concerned about in 
terms of big-time athletic programs 
and changing academic standards," 
Edwards said. "That will never hap-
pen here." 

While UCSD is under a waiver 
this year from the NCAA rules man-
dating athletic aid, faculty on the 
Academic Senate are considering 
the grant-in -aid proposal suggested 
by student affairs that would issue 
$500 scholarships to each entering 
athlete. 

While the lack of cholarships 
may hinder recruitment, it has not 
limited the success of UCSD ath-
letes. ince the university entered 
Divi ion II in 2000, UCSD has been 
ranked as one of the top- 10 athletic 
programs four out of five years. 

According to Edwards, the uni -
verSity wa~ founded With the idea 
that port would be de-emphasized 
through broad -ba~ed participation

Language Affects Half 

of What Is Seen 
According to a study released 

by researchers at UC Berkeley, 
half of what a human can see 
is affect~d by the language one 
speaks. 

Published in the journal 
Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, the study 
suggests that language affects per-
ception in the right ha lf of the 
visua l fie ld but much less, if at all, 
in the left half. 

This new fi nding may be 
explained by the organization 
of the brain, the resea rchers say, 
because language function is pro-
cessed predominantly in the left 
hemisphere of the brain, which 
receives visual information direct-
ly from the right visual field. 

Earlier studies addressi ng the 
pos ible influence of language 
on perception tended to look for 
a simple "yes" or "no" answer. 
However, the current findings 
support both views by demon-
strating that language appears to 
sharpen visual distinctions in the 

right visual field, and not in the 
left . In their paper, the researchers 
conclude that humans ' represen-
tation of the visual world "may 
be, at one and the same time, fil-
tered and not fi Itered through the 
c.ategories of language."

UC Disputes Extent of 
System's Wage Disparities 
• PAY, from page 1 
a plan to bring all employees' sala-
ries to competitive market levels 
within 10 years, according to UC 
spokesman Noel Van Nyhuis. 

"UC has already begun, in ear-
nest, to study the total remuneration 
(salary, health benefits, retirement) 
given to all employees~ he stated 
in an e-mail. "The comparisons 
AFSCME make are 'inappropriate 
and UC is using information from 
an objective outside source for the 
audit. We hope to have the audit 
completed in the next month or so." 

The university's own study, con-
ducted by an outside consulting 
firm, found that the university gen-
eral�y matches comparable market 

levels in total compensation when 
employee health and retirement 
benefits are factored in, Van Nyhuis 
stated. Nevertheless, the state is con-
ducting its own audit of the uni-
versity, and the state Senate Higher 
Education Subcommittee will have 
a hearing about university pay poli-
cies this week. A pe~ition. signed 
by more than 2,000 union workers, 
calls on legislators to use the study 
to examine the difference of pay 
between top executives and other 
employees. 

AFSCI\i£'s data could give unions 
an extra bargaining chip in nego-
tiations with the university, which

Negotiations 
• UNION, from page 2 
made tentative deals with four sepa-
rate unions in December. AFSCME 
is in the process of beginning talks 
with the university about benefits and 
pensions, according to Perez. 

"The executive pay scandal has 
made most of us, including manag-
ers, furious~ said Jorge Olvera, the 
vice president of the service unit for 
AFSCME Local 3299 and a UCSD 
groundskeeper. "We came to UC 
because it was the best place to work 
for and that if we invested in it, it 
would invest in us. Now the UC is 
like Wal-Mart, trying to make the 
most money it can for its executives 
at the cost of oudamilies." 

Some of the December agree-
ments, however, came after long 
and bitter talks. Year-long negotia-
tions between the California Nurses 
Association and the university were 
peppered with accusations that the 
UC system was helping carry out 
Gov. Arnold Schwanenegger's politi-
cal agenda against its own employees. 
The university, however, will refuse 
to bow to any union using the study 
as leverage, according to Van Nyhuis. 

"UC's bargaining record clearly 
demonstrates that the university 
negotiates in good faith with the 
unions of represented UC employ-
ees," he stated. "Any negotiations 
for our employees are to be focused 
solely on the terms and conditions 
of employment of those in particular 
bargaining units. Anything outside 
of that is beyond the scope of bar-
gaining and would only hinder the 
goal of reaching agreements for our 
employees." '

So, Three VC

Here's a trick question: How many UC regents does it take to crew in a light

Well , one of them would sure-

awarded based on the light bulb's 
skin color. Another would lament 
that all of thi s light-bulb-screwing 
is surely hurting . the quality of the 
university and its tudents. A third 
would indignantly call a press con-
ference and demand an independent 
audit into why the light bulb has 
not , in fact, been screwed in . In the 
end, though, not much would get 
done. 

That scenario would be funny 
if it didn't hit so close to home in 

describing the UC Board of Regents, 
which spearheads perhaps one of 
the more dysfunctional and incom-
petent bodies in Ca lifornia state 
government. 

Though the regents rarely leave 
their posh meeting facilities up at 
UC San Francisco to make the pil-
grimage to other UC campuses, their 
role in the lives of students can-
not be understated: Regents make 
all officia l university policies, set 
tuition -fee levels and approve new 
building plans. Which is why all stu-
dents shouid be worried about the 
inadequacy (if not incompetence) of 
the bunch currently at the helm. 

In recent years, the University 
Of California has been plagued by 
a eemingly never-ending series of 
scandals. There were the missing 
secret compute r files and injuries at 
the UC-managed nuclear lab in Los 
Alamos. Then there waS' misman-
agement of the university's pension 
fund . And then there were_ UCLA 
officials who illicitly sold corpses 
donated to the university for medi-
cal research on the black market. 
(That last one was my favorite .) 

In all of these controversies, the 
regents ended up with egg on their 
face; their inability to rein in the 
unwieldy campuses and the UC 
Office of the President has only 
become more apparent in recent 
months, with increased scrutiny 
into the university's compensation 
practices. The scrutiny has suggest -
ed that the regents are as much in 
the dark as everyone else. 

When the San Diego Union-
Tribune first made news, of 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox's undis- . 
closed hiring bonus, the regent 
were equally surprised. "It's disap-
pointing td learn there was a pack-
age put together that I didn't know 
about," Regent John Moores told 
the paper. 

When the San Francisco Chro'licle 
reported on a slush fund that pays 
UC executives who quit working, 
former Regeni Ward Connerly pon -
dered : "Why are individuals getting 
'severa nce' payments for voluntarily 
resigning from a job?" 

And of the Union-Tribune story 
about Fox serving as a director 
of I) corporations and nonprof-
its? "That's a lot of boards;' Regent 
Judith Hopkinson said. 

Yes, a lot indeed.

whl~e males commit suicide at higher rates? 
Can a stereotype kill you? Eighty-six percent of all adolescent suicides are committed by males. And it doesn't,get much better with age; across all age groups, males are 
four times more likely 10 commit suicide than 
females. In fact, suicide is the eighth-leading 
cause of death for all AmeriCan men. And suicide 
is the second-leading cause of death among col-
lege students. 

Even mnre disturbing, everyday culturally-
accepted "male" behavior is being cited as the 
cau e of alarming statistics such as these. 

Researchers at the University of Cincinnati 
suggest that in the western world, and the U.S. in 
particular, there exist a lot of "cultural messages 
about wha.t it means to be masculine~ including 
the beliefs that men don't cry or show emotion, 
that men have to be physically and emotionally 
strong, and that men can take care of themselves 
and houldn't ask for help. Of course, this is cer-
tainly not a new revelation. Ideals and assump-
tions about men are so ingrained into our culture 
that we don't even notice them. AlIeg~dly, men 
never ask for directions or talk about emotions 
with their friends . The opposite stereotype is that 
women overdo it when it comes to talking about 
their feelings. But perhaps the lack of an emo-
tional outlet for males is literally killing them. 

"Women process their experiences with 
friends. They discuss their feel -
ings, seek feedback .... f/iiiiiii .. ~~~~_ 
and take advice;' 

By Megan Durham 
STAFF WRITER 

said George E. Murphy, M.D. and professor of 
psychiatry at the Washington University School 
of Medicine, in an article for Science Daily. This 
approach to problem solving often leads women 
to seek professional help and makes them "much 
more Iike.ly to tell a physician how they feel and 
cooperate in the prescribed treatment, and as 
a result, women get better treatment for their 
depression ." 

Men, in contrast, often shun professional help 
because it is just not considered manly to seek 
treatment. And it's not just for emotional prob -
lems either. According to the U.S. Department 
of Health and HumaJl Services , "Men are twice 
as likely as women to go two years or more 
without seeing a physician:' Perhaps this is part 
of the reason why men generally have higher 
levels of substance abuse and are more likely to 
suffer chronic conditions and fatal diseases than 
women. Murphy worries that men believe they 
"are supposed to be competent in all areas" and 
thus avoid any action, like seeking advice, which 
may show a supposed weakness. It's childish to 
associate seeking medical help with weakness, 
but, unfortunately, society has conditioned many 
men to equate the two. 

A typical man may not even acknowledge his 
problems, let alone see a professional about them. 
It's the same reason why some fraternities com-
pete in binge drinking, or why guys brag about 
how many women they've slept with - those acts 
are matters of maintaining social status among 

male peers. And as anyone who's tried to stage 
an intervention knows, it's especially hard 

to help someone who won't even admit 
to having a problem. 

The shocking fact is that women 
attempt suicide almost twice as 
much as men, yet it is men who 
are four times more likely to 
succeed. The attempts of women 
usually include methods that 
allow for second thoughts or 
rescue, such as an overdose 
of sleeping pills. Men tend to 
use handguns or ropes to end 
their lives, methods that are 
lethally effective and perhaps 
imply that they are deeply 

afraid of being saved. 
"Power and control 

are critically impor-
tant to men,~ said 

Lanny Berman, 
executive direc-

tor of the American Association of SUicidology, 
in the San Francisco Chronicle. To be k.nown as 
someone who attempted suicide would suggest 
not only weakness, but also incompetence, a status 
that is "antithetical to the traditional male role:' 

The disconnect between uieide success levels 
in males and females is staggering, and a person 
might reasonably expect that there would be all 
sorts of studies and foundations dedicated to 
eradicating it. And there are - in other coun-
tries. In the United Kingdom, the Doctor Patient 
Partnership, the British Medical Association and 
the Samaritans are working together on a cam-
paign that targets potential male suicides by dis -

·tributing literature and educating doctors on how 
to talk to their patients. An interview study was 
conducted in Cambridge and Sheffield on male 
masculinity and how it affected their emotional 
well -being. In Australia, the issue has been on 
the table for several years along with the potent 
concern that boys are continually and dramati -
cally falling behind girls in the classroom. The 
"Inquiry irito the Education of Boys" came out 
in 1999 and elCplored how modern methods of 
raising and educating boys affected the "quality 
of their lives as adults~ and was particularly con-
cerned with the high suicide rate among them. 
Yet there is little or no funding in our own coun-
try for this type of research. 

Berman laments the (act that investors aren't 
interested in boys and men. "As much as J would 
love to lead the charge, try to go out and get 
funding for it, if there is no research money avail -
able, no academician is going to go that route," 
he said. 

Some may argue that these stereotypes are 
such a central part of who we are thai it is impos-
sible to change them. But that's simply because 
the root of this problem lies in societal values and 
norms shouldn't deter people from addressing 
it. Just look at what the feminist movement did 
ior feminine education and careers - the same 
must happen with male ideas of machismo and 
self-sufficiency. 

But in order to change the trend, it is necessary 
to get people to care about the problem in the first 
place. The problem must be recognized and stud-
ied, solutions must be formulated and ultimately 
put into place. And there lies the rub: America 
has problems acknowledging that the naturally 
treasured stereotype of the rugged, independent, 
emotionally hard man is actually hurting us. 

But acknowledge the problem we must. 
Research money must be giveO', and the hardened 
facades of our troubled males must be cracked.

Mayhap Your English Teacher Is Right 
Informal standards of 
communication are 
bleeding into everyday 
language - and that's not 
kewl, dood. 

By Robin Marie Averbeck 
STAFF WRITER 

The expression "you are what you eat" is common - but what about "you are what you speak?" Americans do 
not express too much concern over the state 
of their flagging language - in the scheme 
of things, after all, what is a little misspelling 
here or a nonsensical phrase there? Our elec-
tronic age encourages this attit'ude, with the 
quick, fast-paced nature of electronic com-
munication fueling a breakdown of the basic 

, that is the equivalent of "to be," and thus the 
language does not supply a range of concepts 
that go along with that very important idea. 
lt is thought by some that this has helped 
preserve many ancient Chinese political ideas 
that might have otherwise died out more 
quickly in the face of individualistic, Western 
tendencies. Many similar examples can be 
found - many Muslims, for example, protest 
against the translation of the Koran into any 
other language, for only in Arabic can the true 
spirit of the Koran be understood. 

Then again, not everyone wishes to pre-
serve the intellectual heritage English brings 
us. And change is an indisputable, irresistible 
and positive force in language development. 
After all, many grammar scruples are in fact 
rather modern - spelling and capitalization 
were not truly standardized until the '18th and 
19th century, and the trend of capitalization 
was not for a lack of it, as it is today, but an 

overabundance. 
The creation of words 

language. No one is expected 
to have good gramma.r in a 
text message. 

Some argue that classic 
shortcuts - such as substi-
tuting numbers for letters 
- are not transferred into 
important, formal prose. But 
in fact, they are. 

me argue that 
classic shortcuts 

has continued apace as 
well , partiy out of obvi-
ous necessity. There is no 
reason la nguage shou Id 
be held static - it is a 
constantly changing inner 
portrait of a society, and 
must have room for flex -
ibility. 

The problem has gotten 
so bad that U.S. companies 
are reportedly spendi ng $3 
billion every year merely to 
train their workers in basic 
English. And no one who 
owns a computer can fail to 
see the evidence come full 
force in that wellspring of 

- such as substituting 
nwnbers for letters 

- are not transferred 
into important, fonnal 

prose. But in fact, 
theyare.~ 

Destruction, however, 
is very different from 
creation. The invention 
of new words or playing 
with grammar regulations 
is using a language cre-

bad grammar, the Internet. Someone some-
where has figured how to demolish nearly 
every last vestige of English spelling and 
grammar. 

Why does this matter? First, there is a con-
siderable amount of evidence to support the 
saying "You are what you speak." In academia, 
almost every student with Ph.D. aspirations is 
required to learn a foreign language, precisely 
because languages do indeed shape the intel-
lects of those who use them. 

Consider that in Chinese, there is no word 

atively - reducing words 
to mere numbers or sound expressions is not. 
It may be practical, but has any society ever 
declared itself to be merely iPterestedjn utili -
tarianism? 

Those who aspire for an artful society 
would do well to stand by their language, the 
vehicle through which all abstract and senti-
mental thoughts can be verbally expr&ssed. For 
a language is more than a means of communi-
cation for those currently alive; it is a cultural,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR--
Fox Defends Her 

Perfonnance As Chancellor 
Dear Editor: 

I'm gratified that the student editors of the 
Guardian recognize the importance of a full-
time, fully engaged chancellor, and I'm grateful 
for the serious questions they raise about my 
service on both paid and nonprofit boards. 
They, and the campus community, deserve a 
thorough and open response, which this letter, 
in part, seeks to provide. 

I am proud to be UCSD's chancellor. [t is not 
a position or commitment that I view lightly. 
UCSD is a first -class institution and my work 
ethic exemplifies that distinction. 

The duties of a chancellor at a major research 
, university - especially one that incorporates a 

school of medicine and associated hospitals, 
such as UCSD - are demanding and complex, 
and are not confmed to a standard eight -to- five 
workday. The people who work with me will 
attest that I am focused on UCSD business 
from sunrise to well after sunset. I'm at work 
- in my office, on e-mail, on the phone or all 
of the above - when many of my colleagues 
arrive in the r;norning and when they depart 
in the evening. In the evenings and on most 
weekends, I attend numerous university and 
community events. 

I'm sure that the.recipients of my queries and 
messages - from faculty and staff to adminis-
trators in all campus areas - sometimes wish 
that I did not work the 12- and 14-hoUI days 
that I do. 

Since my days as a student, I've been blessed 
with the energy and drive to work a little harder, 
stay a little' longer, and dig a little deeper. This 
drive served me well as I moved into positions 
of increasing responsibility. 1 thrived - and 
still thrive - on the challenges of leading an 
institution, while reaping the deep and fulfilling 
benefits of being a wife, a mother and now a 
grandmother. 

Our campus does indeed have a full -time 
chancellor. I could not serve in good conscience 
unless I could say that with absolute confidence 
- and President Robert C. Dynes and the 
Board of Regents would accept nothing less. My 
role and my responsibilities are clearly defined, 

aJ'ld my actions - both my successes and my 
struggles - are visible to the campus commu-
city and the citizens of California. 

My service on boards, some of which are 
nonprofit (e.g., foundation and government 
agency advisory boards), some of which ply 
me, is a reflection of the value such boards place 
on expert advice. They believe I can help them 
gUide their organization with the insights I've 
gained as a s~ientist and an administrator. In 
return, the issues they face are issues that uni-
versities are already facing themselves, or wiU 
face in the future. 

I serve on more boards than some of my 
peers. Many have other obligations, or enjoy 
othl!f pursuits, and their Jevel of service suits 
their duties and their personal schedules. I fer-
vently enjoy being engaged, and believe firmly 
in the benefits of board service.(even though 
that service often means telephone conferences 
at 5 a.m. Pacific time). 

I am proud of the long hours I devote to 
UCSD, its daily operation and its long-term 
goals. I am incredibly mindful that other duties 
do not detract from that focus. And I am 
meticulous when it comes to accounting for my 
time that is spent on non-UCSD work. I'm also 
proud that our tudents pay attention to my 
work, and hold me (and all of us) to the highest 
standards of performance. 

I will continue to work nill -time meeting 
those expectations. 

- Marye Anne Fox 
UCSD Chancellor

UC Regents Are No Less 
Political than the Legislature 

• KOGAN, from page 4 
Board of Regents has largely allowed 
the constitutionally autonomous 
university to turn into a backwater 
of anarchy and mayhem is that most 
of the people serving on it are politi-
cal hacks. 

The easiest way to get a job as 
a leader of one of the world's most 
prestigious universities, you see, is 
to give a lot of money to the gov-
-ernor. That's how 

election, Davis appointed activist 
and United Farm Workers Union 
co-founder Delores Huerta to the 
university board. 

What's conspicuously missing 
in these considerations, of course, 
are characteristics that would make 
a regent-to-be actually qualified 
to run one of the country's top 
research institutions. Which prob-
ably explains why so many of those 

on the current 
the creator of the 
"Power Rangers" 
got Gov. Gray 
Davis to appoint 
him to the board 
(though he had 
to resign in dis-
grace two years 
ago, after news-
papers caught on 
to the fact that 
he didn't actually 
bother attending 
most of the meet-
1ngs). The tradi-

In response to 

the compensation

Legislature is now 
considering bills 
that would strip

posal, but why 
not go further 
and simply get rid 
of the Board of

- appointed by governors as .part 
of a strategy to use the univer-

Connerly, appointed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson; the firebrand' regent led the 
effort to outlaw affirmative action in 
California, an effort Wilson hoped to 
leverage in securing the Republican 
presidential nomination. 

The fmal category in this typolo-
gy is the ever-popular Token Regent, 
picked to represent the governor's 
commitment to a particular group 
or cause. For example, trying to 
warm up to his Latino constitu-
ency in the months before the recall 

from influencing 
curricula. However, the experience 
of the California State University 
- which lacks the autonomous sta-
tus of the UC system - suggests 
that direct state ov.er ight would not 
be a bad thing; few at CSU campuses 
have claimed that lawmakers have 
manhandled them. And the regents 
have proven to be as politicized as 
the governors who appoint them, 
anyway. 

Scrapping the Board of Regents, 
though, would provide the uni-
verSity with something that it has 
lacked for years: true transparency 
and accountability.

l CoAqe .... EnfcMcemeat wrote

This past fall, one student at Fisher 
College in Boston was expelled for openly 
announcing plans to defame a cat:npus 
police officer with allegations of sexu-
al assault. Residence hall officials at UC 
Santa Barbara have adopted Facebook.com 
as a tool for disciplining students caught 
doing illegal activity. Last August, officials 
at the University of New Mexico blocked 
student access to Facebook.com with the 
aim of protecting. student privacy, but 
have recently brought it back after school 
officials implemented better security mea-
sures within the site. We're watching you . 

J \~ '''.J " h·!· ~( - ............. ;.. ... .... _ .......... .. ................. -. 

Just one of Facebook's many features, 
self-declared groups like "UCSD Chronic 
Society," "Weed and Shrooms" and "Beer 
Bong Appreciation;' entice students who join 
them in jest or in all-seriousness. 

But whether or not evidence of ille-
gal activity is apparent from tagged pho-
tos, "wall" postings or "g roups" that unite 
students under a co llective cause or vice, 
the looming possibility of being caught has 
become very real for stude nts, due to offi-
cials who claim they have the right to inves-
tigate. 

Pacebook.com has swept the nation's col-
lege community off its feet, becoming the 
ninth-most visited Web site on the Internet, 
according to Nielsen/Net ratings cited in a 
recent article in the New York Times. 

What began as a small project birthed 
by a group of Harvard students in 2004 has 
erupted into an onli ne community of about 
five million college students. 

"It's a phenomenon in genera l;' said Sixth 
ollege junior Ryan Underwood, who e eyes 

lit up with familiarity upon h~ring the word 
"Facebook." 

Underwood, who said he checks the peri-
winkle-blue site at least once a day, remarked 
that he prefers Faceb ok tp other online 
networkiJlg sites like Myspace.com, citing a 
better de ign layout. 

Other students have a more,tepid altitude 
toward the "phenomenon" of online net-
working, despite its wide popularity. 

"I have more important things to take 
ca re of and I don't see anything substantial 
ill it," said Revelle College junior Rebecca 
Park, who is a member of Facebook.com but 
rarely checks it. Park noted that she knows 
people who check the site a often as five 

JENNIFER HSU/GUARDIAN 

times a day. 
Thurgood Marshall College senior Van 

Tran is also less involved with the Web site. 
"My friends tell me to join the band-

wagon, but I haven't gotten around to doing 
it:' Tran said. 

The online directory allows students to 
post profiles with their contact informa-
tion; favorite movies, books, and music; and 
most recently, photo albums of themselves 
and their friends - albums that sometimes 
contain photos that draw the attention of 
college officials interested in scoping out 
underage drinking, drug lise or criminal 
threats. 

At UC D, however, screening such sites 
for illegal student activity is not an efficient 
method, according 
to campus polict!. 
Corporal Doug 
O'Dell of crime pre-
vention at the UCSD 
police department, 
who was unfamiliar 
with Facebook.com, 
said th at campus 
police would not try 
to "discover" a crime 
that might not be 
there. 

"Typically, we here 
at the police depart-
ment don't engage in 
fishing expeditions. 
We don't go out and 
look for things that 
are not there," O'Dell 
said. "If we did lise 
the ite, we would be 
investigating some 

••••• • 

By Christine Pae 
FOCUS EDITOR 

kind of crime." 
However, O'Dell acknowledged tl1at if 

any alleged illegal activity posted on such 
sites were reported, the next natural action 
would be to investigate. 

"If that came to our attention, we would 
definitely follow- up:' he said. "But just as 
general practice, no. If somebody was mak-

. ing threats that cause a student fear for their 
safety, we would certainly go to the Web site 
to see what was ·there and use that as a tool 
for whatever crime that has been commit-
ted." 

The policing of online communities with -
in Facebook.com, Myspace.com and even 
online journals, or blogs, may not be a com-
mon method of diScipline, but it has brought 

to light a controver-
sial issue that brings 
forth questions of 
student privacy. 

But maintaining 
privacy depends on 
the information tnat 
is posted at the user's 
discretion . Facebook. 
com allows students 
to display all kinds of 
contact information , 
from e-mail addresses 
to cell phone num-
bers, even the street 
on which they live. 

"If you think about 
it, it's public domain ," 
O'Dell said. "If any-
body can register, 
they can certainly do 
that. It is not an inva-
sion of privacy. People 

don't realize that anybody can read it." . 
Faccbook.com users however, require a 

school e-mail address (.edu) to register and 
log-in, which does not limit access to stu-
dent profiles by faculty members on campus, 
including professors and university employ-
ers. 

Communication professor Robert 
Horwitz said that privacy violations only 
apply in situations when one is concerned 
about protecting certain information, like 
credit card accounts, social security numbers 
or home addresses. 

"Privacy really comes to play when you 
don't want to P!lt info out," Horwitz said. 

Thurgood Marshall College senior and 
on -campus Community Service Officer 
Cynthia Concha agrees. 

"You shouldn't be displaying it anyways;' 
Concha said. "The police are doing their 
job. What does it matter what method they 
use?" Concha noted that she had not heard 
of campus police utilizing Facebookcom a 
a tool for law enforcement. 

"There's been no word about using this at 
all," she said. 

Still, certain photos may arouse suspi-
cion. If a Facebook plloto shows an under-
age student holding a red plastiC cup, does 
that necessarily mean it contains alcohol? 
Is the smoke in that bong from tobacco or 
marijuana? The answers may not be obvious, 
but to some law enforcement officials, such 
photos give incentive to investigate. Despite 
uch easy access in finding illegal activity 

through Facebook, many law enforcers still 
mainly rely on crime tips. 

"Information passes from point A to 
point B," Tran said. "It could happen by word 
ofmouth.* J

Move Over Craigslist, Students Have a N~w Tradi~g Tool 
TritonTrader.com 
makes finding new 
roommates and cheap 
books nearby an even 
bigger piece of cake. 

By Grucf Wu 
STAff WRITER 

C raigslist isn't the only kid on the block anymore with the recent launch of 
TritonTrader.com, an online classi-
fieds resource that caters specifically 
to the UCSD community. 

UCSD students, staff and fac-
ulty are able to post listings for 
items such as bOOKS, furniture and 
sport ing goods for free. Clubs and 
organizations are able to post their 
events on the Web site as well. 

The idea for TritonTrader.com 
arose when Thurgood Marshall 
College junior Haleh Khadem moved 
off campus and had to buy furniture 
for her apartment. She did find a 
chair she needed from Craigslist, 
but it was 20 miles out in El Cajon. 
Khadem's partner, John Muir College 
senior Tommy ehheng, 'coinciden-_ 
tally thought of the idea at the same 
time. 

The bulk of listings on the Web 
site is for textbooks, with approxi-
mately 25-35 entries at press time. 

"[Web sites like Amazon.com] 
collect commission from its sellers, 
but we don't take any money whatso-
ever," Khadem said. "We don't charge 
because it's not in our philosophy. 
When I was using Amazon.com, J 
felt like I was getting ripped off; why 
should they take a percentage of 
what we're selling? College students 
are aU broke anyway, so why charge 
us for it?" 

Chheng agreed that it is imprac-
tical ~ charge users for the services 

(Be a

TritonTrader has to offer. 
' We want to get as many people 

to use the Web site as possible," 
Chheng said. "It's unrealistic to 
charge college students, it's meant 
for the budget college student, so 
it's beside the point to take money 
from them." 

In many cases, people do not 
even have to pay for shipping and 
handling because the trade can be 
made at schobl, or if it is more 
convenient, somewhere off campus 
instead. What makes coordinating 
a meeting place much more conve-
nient is that sellers have an option 
of indicating whether they live on-or 
off-campus and specifying the build-
ing or apartment complex, such as 
La Regencia or Muir Apartments. 

For Khadem, effi.dency is impor-
tant because many students who 
live on campus do not have cars. 
With TritonTrader, they can easily 
get what they need without driving 
anywhere. 

"We want to focus on the lower 
c1assmen; Khadem said. 

One such lowerdassmen is 
Revelle College sophomore Molica 
Anderson, who appreciates the new 
and convenient site, citing it as a 
"localized Craigslist." 

"I think it is really easy to use and 
there's not a hassle because I don't 
have to pay anything," Anderson 
said. "I think it's nice to have some-
one to trade with within the uni-
versity. I'm just waiting to sell more 
stuff I don't need:' 

Since TritonTrader.com was only 
launched the first week of winter 
quarter, Khadem said it is not yet 
as popular as she would like it to 
be. However, Chheng, who is in 
charge of computer and Web site 
operations, said taking into account 
the short amount of time the Web 
site has been launched, he thinks 
it is considerably successful. The 
numbers don't lie - in one day 

alone, there were 1,000 hits to the 
Web site. 

Khadem, who comm311ds the 
advertising and marketing of the 
Web site, said the main form of 

... advertisement is word of mouth . 
Many of the people who have put 
up listings are friends of Khadem or 
Chheng and heard about it through 
them. Not only that, Khadem is tak-
ing advantage of any opportunity 
she has to advertise, whether it is 
writing "TritonTrader.com" on the 
boards in her classes, alerting the 
Greek community or advertising in 
the GUllrdilln. 

Currently, TritonTrader.com is in 
a very grass-roots stage. 

"[Maintaining the Web site] 
comes out of our paychecks from 
work because we haven't received any 
funding yet,- Khadem said. Chheng 
hopes for funding in the future from 
sponsors, but he does not expect the 
site to become the next eBay. 

"I have no plans right now for 
this to become a busipess venture; 
Chheng said. "It is for UCSD stu-
dents and faculty. That's the main 
goal. If we happen to make profit in 
the future, that's great; if not, that's 
fine by us too." 

Chheng is unsure of what he will 
do if TritonTrader.com does become 
a household name, although he does 

, want a Facebook effect.

·Once we get more .people on 
the Web site, it will cost more to 
run," Chheng said. "It will be a lot 
like Facebook. Once they got more 
people to join, they were able to 
implement what people wanted. I 
want more feedback from students 
and faculty. Whatever's popular, we'll 
decide if we are able to implement 
it or not, just like how Facebook 
implement!d photo galleries." 
. Whole galleries may not be fea-
sible yet, but the site allows post-
ing of photos if participants are 
interested.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2006 

. Quarterback 
Needs To 

End Feuding 
• RACE, from page 1 6 
who is probably unaware of the ever-
developing Eagles drama. 

In November 2005, Owens was 
asked if he agreed with Michael Irvin's 
comments that the Eagles would be 
undefeated if they had Brett Favre 
under center. T.O., unaware that his 
answer would drop an atomic bomb 
on the NFL, agreed based on McNabb's 
injury problems and Favre's legend-
ary leadership, courage, toughness and 
amazins arm strength. 

Although Owens' innocent answer 
was correct, Donovan should have 
heard it from Stephen A. Smith, not 
from his teammate, espedally consid-
ering their rough relationship. Proving 
words sting deep, Owens' comment 
was the straw that broke the camel's 
- or Andy Reid's - back and it cost 
one of the best playmaking receivers in 
the game over half a season. 

Now let's jump back to last week, 
when McNabb revealed his innermost 
thoughts to the American public. In 
his interview, McNabb said that the 
Favre comment hurt because it felt like 
a slap in the face and that it was like a 
black-on-black crime. 

McNabb said that if Owens had 
referred to someone like Michael Vick, 
Daunte Culpepper or Steve McNair 
instead of Favre, it would not have been 
as bad. Donovan paralleled Owens' 
comments as if McNabb had said he 
wished he had Joe Jurevicious or Steve 
Largent catching passes for him. Are all 
black receivers supposed to stick with 
black quarterbacks? If Jeremy Shockey 
said that McNabb would be a better 
fit at QB then Eli Manning, would it 
invoke white-on·whitt crime talk? 

McNabb may have some valid 
points about Owens' cancerous effects, 
but talcing offense at the Favre com-
ment because of race is bogus. When 
Irvin ftrst made the comment, he 
brought up Favre as an example of a 
passer who is struggling because of a 
lack of talent surrounding him. He then 
said that if Favre had Philadelphia's 
offense around him, the Eagles would 

- be undefeated. Owens and Irvin never 
meant to say that black quarterbacks, 
like McNabb, rely too much on being 
mobile and that only white quarter-
backs are reliable pocket passers. The 
whole McNabb-favre comparison was 
about talent, not race, but McNabb, · 
feeling victimized after limbaugh's 
attacks. had to pull the race card out 
of his sleeve. 

Not only was the black-on-black 
claim preposterous, but McNabb 
agreed to this big exclusive at the most 
inopportune time for two reasons. 
First, with Owens on the way to the 
first coach willing to take him and the 
first general manager willing to pay 
for him, this verbal sparring should 
be coming to an end. Both are mature 
men capable of ending the feud and -
McNabb even said that he was done 
talking about T.O. at a midseason 
press .conference. Yet here he is on 
SportsCenter, telling all and digging 
for controversy in a story that should 
have been over months ago. The sec-
ond reason McNabb's timing was 
offensive is the conflict with the Super 
Bowl McNabb's interview rained on 
the parade of Super Bowl festivities, 
when the public is excited about seeing 
a game with pleasurable personalities, 
not embellished egos. The stories in 
the week leading up to the XL game 
should be about the ever-smiling Hines 
Ward, Seahawks' rookie sensation lofa 
Tatupu, the Steelers' second-year quar-
terback and crazy-haired safety, the 
record-setting MVP running back. or, 
of course, Jerome Bettis' triumphant 
return to his hometown for what will 
likely be bis final game. These are the 
types of stories that belong in the week 
of anticipalion before the game. 

Instead, McNabb dampened the 
mood with his ridiculous claims - and 
for that, I say shame on you, Donovan. 
Your only chance for retribution is to 
never again talk about T.O. or continue 
this feud, because I know I speak for 
all of us when I say I've had enough 
drama - let's get to the football.

Spirit Night 
Crowd Leads 

to Big Win 
~ BLOWOUT, from page 16 
of-9 shooting from the foul line. 

wI knew [Cal State Los Angeles 1 had 
a really big guy [6-foot. IO-inch center 
Micah Hamiltonl who was probably 
going to be slow, so I just tried to use 
my agility and quickness to go aroWld 
him all night long; Patterson said. 
"Luckily, they were dropping tonight." 

Hatch •• the CCAA Freshman of 
the Year in 2004-05. was sent to the 
bench to start the game. and respond-
ed by sinking all five of his field 
goal attempts. earning 10 points. two 
rebounds and two assists in 20 min-
utes of action. 

"Coach not starting me kind of said 
a lot, so I just had to come and bring 
the intensity:' Hatch said. "Whatever I 
can do to help the team. I'm willing to 
do. Starting isn't everything; winning is 
everything~ 

The team-first mentality helped 
the Tritons shoot 50 percent from the 
field. while also winning the battle for 
rebounds, 33-31. Poppen led the way 
on the glass. pulling down a team -high 
six boards to go with his nine points. 
Odiye was effective in distributing the 
ball, racking up a game-high six assists 
and chipping in six points. 

Cal State Los Angeles was led by 
forward Jontae Vinson. who had 16 
points and five reboWlds. Held in 
check most of the game, Vinson scored 
his team's final six points, but was still 
held below his season average of 19 
points per game. Guard Gene Myvett 
added 14 points and forward Marques 
Hamilton had six points, a game-high 
seven rebounds and four assists for the 
Golden Eagles. 

Lady Tritons 
Fall from 

First Place 
~ TIEBREAKER, from page 1 6 
shots. "We knew we needed to be 
physical and match their strength ." 

The game was a very aggressive 
one, with many bad falls and hard 
fouls, which showed the physical 
play both teams were willing to use 
for the win. 

The Tritons were ahead by 21 
points at the half and started the 
second half with an 8-0 run for what 
became their largest lead in a game, 
at 51 -22 with 18 minutes. 17 seconds 
left to play. The Golden Eagles tried 
to even out the score, chopping it 
down to 65-56 after a three-pointer 
by junior guard Amber Fouse. 

Hinga attributed Los Angeles'

Junior guard Kim Buffum, 
who made four three-pointers off 
the bench. was key to keeping the 
Tritons' lead by responding to the 
Golden Eagles' rally with a clutch 
basket outside the arc. 

UCSD kept at least a 12-point 
lead the rest of the way, thanks in 
part to Juster, who contributed 30 
points on 11 -of-18 shooting from , 
the floor and a perfect 8-of-8 from 
the charity stripe. becoming the only 
player in UCSD history to ' score 
more than 30 points three times in 
a season. 

Aside from picking up on Cal 
State Los Angeles' sloppy passing, 
the Tritons used clever defense to 
keep the Golden Eagle offense at 
bay. 

"Trap defense was pretty effective 
on them because of their susceptibil-
ity to steals,· Hinga said. 

The crowd was also a great help 
in intimidating the opponents. 

·We proved last time was just an 
off night,· Buffum said. "I absolutely 
loved tonight. The fans were with us 
in every play. They bad great chants 
and we just fed off their energy so 
much ... It really changes the atmo-
sphere of the game."

Aces Season-Opening Test

but fall to Azusa 
Pacific,7-2,evenUng 
record in young season. 

By Rae! Entten 
SPORTS EDITOR 

The VCSD women's tennis team 
dropped its second match of the 
year to Azusa Pacific University on 
Feb. 4, shortly following the Tritons' 
impressive season-opening victory 
over Grand Canyon University on 
Feb. I. 

The Tritons came into their 
matchup against the Cougars with 
confidence. fresh off a 9-0 sweep of 
the Antelopes to start the year. 

However. Azusa Pacific put 
up much more of a fight than the 
Antelopes, winning five of six singles 
matches and two of three doubles 
matches to win the meet 7-2. 

The Tritons' only singles victory 
came from freshman Tessa Tran, 
who won her fllst game 7 -5 and took 
a 1-0 lead in the second before her 
opponent was forced to forfeit due 
to an injury. 

In doubles competition, the duo 
of freshman Ina Dan and junior Liz 
Brown was the only combination 
strong enough to beat the Cougar 
pairs, earning an 8-5 victory. 

Despite the disappointment 
following the loss in their sec-
ond match , the Tritons came into 
their opening match against Grand 
Canyon on Feb. I with very high 
expectations, claiming the No. 10 
ranking before playing a regl1lar sea-
son competition . 

The team lived up to its hype, 
dominating its Antelope opponents, 
9-0, on the way to its first win of the 
year. It came even easier than the 

Tritons expected, as Grand Canyon. 
arrived with only five players, forc-
ing the Antelopes to forfeit the No.3 
double and No. 6 singles matches. 

With an easy lead, the Tritons 
took to the court and expanded 
on their advantage by sWeeping the 
final seven matches, two doubles 
and five Singles. to earn the 9-0 
victory. 

In the first singles match, UCSD 
junior Marsha Malinow took on 
Grand Canyon's Medini Sharma. 
After dropping the first set 5-7, 
Malinow came back strong, taking 
the second set 6-2 to force a decisive 
third set. Malinow was determined 
to complete her comeback. but 
Sharma would not give in. The two 
went back and forth , with Malinow . 
finally closing out the match with a 
10-8 win in the tiebreaking set. 

Malinow's match was the toughest 
of the day, as the rest of the Tritons 
dominated their Golden Eagle oppo-
nents. Junior Katie McKee was all 
business, taking care of her adver-
sary Lindsay Hardy, 6-4. 6-1. 

Dan looked impressive as well. 
shutting out Lauren Eutsler, 6-0, 6-
O. Dan's fellow freshman Tran also 
dominated her opponent, Gloria 
Siakoff, 6-0, 6-0. while junior Kristin 
Bronowicki finished off the singles 
matches with a 6-1, 6-1 win over 
Heidi Schnizlein . 

With the Tritons' singles' players 
doing their part, the two doubles 
partners of Malinow with Marissa 
Hilker and McKee with Bronowicki 
paralleled the success. winning both 
matches with ease. Malinow and 
Hilker took out the Antelopes' com-
bination of -Sharma and Hardy. 8-0, 
while McKee and Bronowicki topped 
Eutsler and Schnizlein. 8- 1. 

The Tritons will face tougher 
tests later on in the season , includ-
ing their next match against Point

Coming off a thrilling match 
against Princeton University for its 
first win of the season, the UCSD 
men's voUeyball team lost to No. 9 
UC Santa Barbara in straight games 
on Feb. 2. 

The loss kept the Tritons win-
less in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation and dropped them to 1-
8 overall for the season, while the 
Gauchos improved to 5-6 (4-4 in the 
MPSF). 

"Offensivelf, we were pretty good 
tonight. but what we didn't do was 
block the baJJ:' coach Kevin Ring 
said. "They hit for too high of a per-
centage." 

Led by sophomore outside hitter 
Russ Hardy. who had 13 kills, and 
senior outside JUtter Ton Daze, who 
had 10, UCSD hit .287 for the match. 
UC Santa Barbara, however, hit at 
a much higher percentage of .533 
with the help of junior outside hitter 
Aaron Richman's 16 kills. 

The Tritons came out flat and 
lacked energy from game one. They 
feU behind early, but puUed to within 
two points on five different occa-
sions. However, the Gauchos didn't 
let it get any closer and took the first 
game 24-30. 

In game two, VCSB hit at a .609 
dip. as UCSD was never really in the 
game and lost 23-30. 

Game three was the most compet-
itive, but untimely, unforced errors 
ruined milny Triton runs and gave 
the Gauchos a 24-30 win in game 
three and a 3 -0 win in the match. 

The night before, the Tritons were 
ab1e to deliver an at-home win against 
Princeton for Ring's first victory as 
head coach. After the game, Ring told 
his players that he appreciated their 
effort in the matchup. 

"We play in such a competitive 
schedule, so any win is big for us;' 
Ring said.

Sophomore middle blocker John Mark Wendler follows through 0'1 a kill attempt in 
the Tritons' 3-1 comeback victory over the Princeton Tigers, their firs t of the season. 

Last season, the Tritons didn't get 
their first win Wltil March 9 against 
California Baptist University 17 
games into the season. This year's 
team hopes it can continue to do 
better than last year's team, which 
needed 22 games to defeat a MPSF 
team. 

Senior opposite Chris Sayers pro-
vided a lot of energy and aggressive 
play with a match -high 19 kills and 
hit at a .400 dip. Daze added 12 kills 
as the Tritons out-blocked theiroppo-
nent 15-9. Sophomore libe.ro Joseph 
Sexton had II digs while junior setter 
Brooks Dierdorff ran the offense with 
50 assists. 

With several of their players from 
the San Diego area, the Tiger fans 
outnumbered the Triton fans. In 
game one, there were nine ties and 
it went back and forth. but ultimately 
Princeton received a lot more energy 
from its crowd to put the game away 
27 -30 on a kill by freshman middle 
blocker Michael Vmcent. 

Game two started with a 10-4 
Triton run spraked by sophomore 
middle blocker John Mark Wendler 
and a block by sophomore outside 
hitter Russ Hardy. As the Tigers cut 
the deficit to only two points, two 

power kills by Sayers cemented the 
30-27 win for UCSD. 

"Last game, we came out real 
flat against University of Southern 
California, so we addressed that and 
everyone just stepped up their game:' 
Daze aid. 

UCSD played its best game of 
the year statistically in game three, 
hitting a .406 clip to Princeton's .156. 
The Tigers weren't able to keep up 
with Sayers' huge kills, I;Vhich stopped 
runs and fired up the crowd. Hardy 
ended the game with a kill for a 30-21 
UCSD victory, putting the Tritons up 
2-1 for the match. 

"[The Tritons] have more athleti -
cism in their game, we just couldn't 
handle them:' Princeton coach Glenn 
Nelson said. 

Princeton came out strong in 
ganle four, leading 8-10, but five-
straight points capped by a Sayers ace 
put the Tritons at ease. The Tigers 
would get no closer than three points 
as the Triton cruised to a win, 30-
23. 

"It takes a little pressure ofr.' Daz.e 
said. "It's a good solid win:' 

UCSD finally gets a little time off 
before heading out on the road.to face 
Long Beach State on Feb. 10.

CSUB Takes Sole Possession of. CCAA Lead' 
No. 13 Roadrunners 
extend win streak to 
16 games while ending 
Tritoris' run at 11 wins 
with 80-72 victory. 

By Nicky Buchanan 
STAFF WRITER 

The lack of balloons ' and more 
than 1,000 screaming fans celebrat-
ing pirit ight was not the only 
difference between the women's 
basketball team's games on Feb. 4 
and the day before. 

The Tritons dropped their lat-
est matchup against o. 13 al 
State Bakersfield, jl.l st one night 
after increaSing their wi n streak to 
II -straight games agai n t Cal State 
Los Angeles in front of a raucous 
crowd . 

The - Roadrunners and the 
Tritons both came into the game 
with 10-1 league records and each 
team had a chance to take posses-
sion of the California Collegiate 
Athletics Association lead with a 
victory. However, it was Cal State 
Bakersfield that fought harder, 
overcoming the Tritons with a sec-
ond-half comeback to win by a 
final score of 80-72. 

A fter the close loss, the team 
seemed like it had just experienced 

• a tragedy. The Tritons were the only 
team to beat the Roadrunners this 
season and were expected to put up 
quite a fight against the No. I seed 
in the West Region. 

The loss marked an end to 
UCSD's II -game winning streak, 
but the Tritons put a positive spin 
on the loss. 

"It could be a good thing for 
us in the end," freshman forward 
Michelle Osier said. "After so many 
wins we sort of lost the feeling of 
how bad it feels to loose. Hopefully 
the reminder will help push us 
harder against Chico State and even 

in the playoffs:' 
UCSD had a tender lead of 42-

41 at intermission, but failed to 
deliver in the second half, making 
only 8-of-22 shots from the floor 
and allowing the Roadrunners to 
eventually outscore them for the 
eight-point victory. 

"We didn't play too structured 
and that hurt us," said ju nior guard 
Leora Juster, whose 16 points fell 
well below her season average. "We 
struggled with free throws, exces-
sive dribbling and picking balls in 
traffic. Rebounsling is what usually 
keeps u in the game but we just 
couldn't take advantage of that like 
we're used to. They were a good 
team who forced us out of our com-
fort zone and took advantage of our 
weaknesses, which we unfortunate-
ly showed a little too much of." 

Osier also attributed some of 
the Tritons' troubles to exce sive 
fouls. 

"[The Roadrunners] really drove 
on people like me with foul trouble 
and there wasn't much we could 
really do about that; Osier said. 

While the team failed to come 
away with a win, a few players put 
up impressive individual efforts. 

Osier set a new career high 
with 21 points, in addition to 14 
rebounds, three assists and two 
steals. 

") just really tried to drill the 
lane when it wa's opened and kept 
the idea of a win in my mind," Osier 
said. "I just wanted to contribute as 
much as I could to the team." 

Sophomore center Briana Hinga 
also set some career highs with 16 
points and 18 rebounds, to go along 
with four assists, three steals and 
five blocked shots. 

Despite her own good playing, 
Hinga expressed her frustration 
with the game as a whole. 

"Bakersfield played like we 
expected them to and really wanted 
to avenge their loss; she said. "I 
was more frustrated by the fact that
