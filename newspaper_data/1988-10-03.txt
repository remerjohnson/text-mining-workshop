CrowdRu~s Wild; Conc~rt Cut Short 
Five Thousand Jam the Hump for Calamitous Friday Night Show 

By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
News Ed;Ior 

A concert intended to ignite 
start-of-the-year spirit collapsed 
into an unruly mob scene Friday 
night. 

The show, by the national 

recording artists the Untoucha-
bles, was supposed to begin im-
mediately following a women's 
volleyball game. 

Instead, it was delayed as stage 
hands and security members at-
tempted around 9:30 p.m. to calm 
down the already rowdy crowd so 
the band could come on stage. 

Student Employees 
Out in Cold for Health 

By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
SIIfff Wriler 

Recently the Regents changed the univenity employee benefit 
plan to provide equal benfits for all ends of the salary scale but 
student employees were not included. 

The plan was cbanaed so tbat employees at the low end of the 
salary scale now receive benefits on a par with those at the hiaher 
end of the salary scale. 

"They (the Univenity] had an unequal distribution of health 
benefits and the state mandated that the UC system make its 
benefit proaram a more equitable situation,· UCSD Graduate 
Student Association President Randall Gila said. 

However, this chanae did not affect student employees. Stu-
dents who are employed with the U Divenity are cateaorizcd as 
only workiq49.999 pcrc:cnt of the work week - just below the 
minimum required to receive benefits. 

To help deeide tbe iuuo ofwbether or not "lIdent employees 
should be' eliaible for health care benefits, the University of 
California is holdin, open forum dilcuuio .. at UCLA and UC 
Berkeley on Oct. 4 and 6.

SPORTS .......... 24 

A.S. Programming Commis-
sioner Jonathan Judaken stood 
before an estimated crowd of S,OOO 
people and pled with them to 
cooperate with officials in order 
to clear off the stage which was 
the top of the gym steps, so that 
the band could play. 

The crowd ignored him and the 
stream of people leaving the late 
volleyball game ran into the crowd 
trying to get closer to the band on 
the steps and the stage, making 
movement impossible. 

According to Judaken, he and 
other officials hoped that if the 
band came out it would help calm 
down the crowd. 

The band came out and played 
one song, "I Spy for the FBI." 
However, they could barely be 
heard by those who were not in 
the front. Sound officials said 
that the wire to the house sound 
system was cut, leaving only the 
stage sound system operational. 

The band's first song did 
nothing to help calm the crowd. 
Instead, things became worse as 
people crowded on the Hump 
and swayed and ran in circular 
motion as one solid entity. 

There was constant pressure in 
front from people trying to get 
closer to the stage and to get over 
the yellow rope which was used as 
a barricade. 

An attempt was made to set up 
a barrier of tables, but according 
to police Sergeant Rick Michel-
son, it was just too late to build an

effective barricade. He added that 
while the crowd surged, one 
woman was actually thrown from 
the crowd over the tables toward 
the stage. 

After the first song, the Un-
touchables left the stage as the 
police, sound people, and pro-
gram officials became concerned 
with health and safety. 

According to Judaken the band 
initially worried about the crowd's 
safety but eventually became 

. concerned with its own as people 
were throwing bottles, full cans of 
beer and even shoes up on stage. 

In addition, there were prob-
lems with water and alcohol get-
ting on electrical equipment, 
which, in Judaken's words posed 
a "frightening safety problem." 

Following more attempts to 
control the crowd, the band came 
out again and played their second 
song and it was announced that 
the concert had to be ended. 

Judaken said that the decision 
to end the concert was the most 
prudent one. "It [the situation] 
crossed a line that is not safe to 
cross. " 

He described the problem as 
being "a lot of drunk people not 
thinking forthemselves." Judaken 
stressed that not only were people 
just not acting responsibly, but 
also they were thinking "mob-
like" and getting absorbed into 
the motion of the crowd. 

Also, Judaken added that a 
good deal ofthe audience was not 

SPORTS 

made up of UCSD students, and 
he claimed that this contributed 
to the crowd being uncooperative 
and not conscientious of the need 
to stay in control to allow the 
event to be successful. 

"I think in the end people didn't 
care whether it went on - they 
were just interested in the high 
spirit of it," Judaken said. 

After the crowd began to de-
part, police officer Randy Feedak 
told the Guardian that there had 
been some miscommunication 
between the police and the A.S. 

Feedak said that the popularity 
of the band was not made clear to 
the police, and that had they 
known the popularity of the 
Untouchables, the police would 
have been prepared with a better 
barricade. In his words, the set-up 
at the gym steps is designed for a 
"folk-group" type of concert. 

Judaken agreed that the gym 
steps were not designed for this 
type of a concert. "The band 
should have had a real stage and 
barrier, but these things are 
impossible for programmers," he 
said. 

Untouchables guitarist Clyde 
Grimes also agreed that the con-
cert could have been run better: "It 
was just too crazy, you should've 
had a higher stage or charged 
admission. "

U C EstabUshes Co-op Center 

The University of California has established a <;ali-
fornia Center for Cooperatives. based at uc Dav~s. to 
assist the state's more than 1,500 co-ops compete In 
an increasingly complex business environment. 

The center founded by UC's Division of Agricul-
ture and Nat~ral Resources, is the first of its kind in 
California and one of two nationwide. It will serve 
cooperatives such as agricultural co-ops, credit 
unions housing co-ops and co-op supermarkets. Ken~eth R. Farrell, UC's vice president for agricul-
ture and natural resources, said, "We consider the 
center an opportunity to assist cooperatives, to help 
them adjust to rapid changes in the national and 
international marketplace." 

One of the factors that set cooperatives apart from 
other businesses is ownership by co-op members, 
employees or consumers. . . 

In California, co-ops market more than S8 bllhon 
worth of goods and services. Agricultural co-op~ 
alone account for $6 billion worth of commodities 
from raisins to cotton produced by an estimated 
70,000 farmers. 

While agricultural co-ops by far represent the larg-
est segment, employee-owned businesses. h~usi~g co-
ops and wholesale buying groups are expenenclng the 
fastest rates of growth, said center acting director 
Leon Garoyan, an agricultural economist.. . 

The center will provide management training for 
co-op staff and directors, as well as information on 
business opportunities such as joint ventures, finan~­
ing, marketing and international trade, Garoy~n said. 

It will disseminate information to other bUSinesses, 
such as banks that finance co-ops, to foster a better 
understanding of the co-op business structure and 
accounting practices, he said. I ~" .' SPOTLIGHT

Nobel Laureate 

Pauling Talks Metals 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
S~nio, Staff W'it~' 

Internationally-renowned 
chemist Linus Pauling gave a 
lengthy, somewhat confusing but 
fascinating lecture to a full house 
in Mandeville Auditorium last 
Friday night. tracing the history 
of chemistry from the late 18th 
century to the prese·nt. 

Pauling is the only person to 
receive two unshared Nobel 
prizes, one for chemistry in 1954 
and the Peace prize in 1963. 

At Friday's lecture Pauling 
spoke mainly on the chemistry .of 
metals, pointing out that while 
theories ofthe structure of organic 
and some inorganic molecules 
have been well-developed, the 
same cannot be said for metals. 

"By the time that quantum 
mechanics was discovered [in the 
mid-1920s], there had already 
been developed a remarkable, 
powerful theory of chemical 
structure, " Pauling said. 

The same thing did not happen 
in regard to metals, according to 
Pauling. "Chemists have pretty 
much ignored metals up to the 
present time," he said. "This was 
because metals are somewhat 
more difficult to understand." 

In 1922, when Pauling began 
his graduate work at the Califo.r-
nia Institute of Technology In 
Pasadena, no one knew what the 
structures of metal compounds 
were. Using x-ray diffraction, 
Pauling mana&ed to figure out 
the structure of several com-
pounds shortly after he entered 
Cal Tech. 

Today, Pauling said, there are 
over 24,000 metal compounds 
with over 4,000 different struc-
tures. 

However, he added, "no one 
has yet developed a theory ofthe 
nature of the bonding in metals 
and intermetallic compounds that 
is anywhere near so powerful as 
the theories that we have about 
the structure of other inorganic 
substances and of organic com-
pounds" - theories that Pauling 
played a large part in developing. 

"Despite, then. the enormous 
variety of uses people have f9und 

Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling 
for metals, we know very little 
about the hows and whys of their 
structures, though we do have 
reams of empirical data gathered 
by physicists using x-ray diffrac-
tion," Pauling said. 

Pauling expressed his hope that 
"there are a good number of 
young students of chemistry here 
who will attack this problem 
[and] help to lead the solid-sta~e 
physicists out of the gloomy wil-
derness they find themselves in." 

This comment drew laughter 
from the crowd. 

Speaking without notes, Paul-
ing, who is 87 years old, then dis-
cussed the history of chemistry, 
and used a series of slides to illus-
trate his points. Starting with 
methane (CH.), Pauling worked 
his way up in sophistication from 
the carbon tetrahedral structure 
in a molecule of that substance to 
the more complex structure of 
hemoglobin molecules. 

He then discussed briefly the 
major scientific contributions of 

Phi Kappa Theta

ROBERTO'S' NIGHT 
Wednesday, OCT. 5, 1988 
Stop by the table for information 

quite a few famous chemists, and 
after that the lecture became diffi-
cult to understand. 

He did make a number of points 
that lay people could comprehend, 
however. 

Because three-quarters of the 
elements are metals, "metals 
should be a large part of chemis-
try," Pauling said. "I am still 
puzzled that the chemistry text-
books make essentially no men-
tion of the chemistry of metals, 
part of the reason being that there 
isn't a good theory." 

While the structure of metal 
compounds is known, the bond-
ing between thr individual atoms 
is not clearly understood, accord-
ing to PaUling. This is tru.e .al-
though a theory of conductiVIty, 
which Pauling explained, has been 
developed. 

At the end ofthe lecture, Paul-
ing discussed superconductivity 
briefly. 

"I've seen the statement that if 
you start a current in a donut of 
lead .. . [that has] a temperature of 
less than 8 Kelvin [-265 dearees 
Celsius]. that current will con-
tinue for billions of years," Paul-
ing said. "It's likely that if room-
temperature superconductors that 
didn't cost too much could be 

ma~e, they would have t~emend­
ous Impact on technology In many 
different ways." 

Recently, the temperature at 
which superconducting materials 
become superconducting has risen 
dramatically, up to 126 Kelvin 
(-147 degrees Celsius). 

"I believe there's a good chance 
that room temperature supercon-
ductors will be developed during 
the next few years, and that this 
development will have a great 
impact on technology," Pauling 
concluded. 

Pauling's lecture was the.firs.t in 
the Laureate Lecture Senes, 
which will bring to San Diego 
several Nobel scholars from all 
disciplines. 

Ther series is also part of the 
"New Sweden '88" events, which 
celebrate the 350th anniversary of 
Swedish settlement in North Ame-
rica. The next speaker, who will 
give a talk in December, is nuclear 
physicist Glenn Seaborg.

BGIF Fiasco 
The first all-campus concert of the quarter turned, 

into a dangerous fiasco Friday night. There's plenty 
of blame to go around, starting with A.S. pro-
grammers, but what happened suggests something 
more disquieting than a botched job: UCSD may 
have outgrown concerts on the Hump. 

As many as five thousand people crowded the 
Hump for the free concert by the Hnt"Ouchables, a 
ska/ reggae band with national credentials. ThaCs an 
unbearably large crowd for that area; 'llnd the situa-
tion got out of hand. The band could play only three 
songs, .the second, appropriately enough, "Wild 
Child." 

Programmers bear responsibility for scheduling 
the show right on the heels of a volleyball game in the 
Gym, which delayed the concert. The concert 
couldn't stand any delay because it was originally 
scheduled late - at 9:30 p.m. Once it did start, the 
sound was too low because of sound cables that were 
inadequately secured. In fact, a friend of ours 
commented, "Hey, I could hear a conversation I was 
having. It must not have been loud enough. to It's also 
the fault of programmers that there were no adequate 
barriers between the band and the crowd, endanger-
ing the band and its expensive equipment and the 
people in the crush at the front . 

The university, a police officer told us, is too cheap 
to buy barriers for which there is only a sporadic 
need. The barriers are critical for large crowd events 
and should be purchased immediately. 

The crowd bears responsibility, too. Broken glass 
littered the area. People packed the Gym wait-
ing to watch volleyball whIle they waIted lor the 
concert to start. At the end of the game, they dashed 
out to get room up front, trampling those in their 
way. This was the most dangerous part of the evening; 
the selfish, uncontrolled actions ofthese people could 
have resulted in deaths . And, no one responded to 
A .S . Programming Commissioner 10nathan 1udak-
en's appeals for calm before and during the brief 
concert. 

More seriously in terms of long term consequences 
is the lack of any kind of concert facility on campus. It 
was the first concert of the quarter. People are always 
dying for an excuse to party at the start of a new 
academic year. There was no place to put all those 
people and all that energy. (The crowd was larger 
than expected too.) 

The new student center ballroom will accomodate 
roughly 1,500 people tops for a concert. Proposals are 
circulating around campus for a new, bigger gym that 
could contain crowds of four to five thousand, but 
even if it comes about, it will have three of the same 
problems the current Gym has: it will be an acoustic 
nightmare, concerts won't have scheduling priority 
and the atmosphere will be high schoolish. 

UCSD has 17,000 students now. If we're going to 
have a big party, we're going to have a big crowd. This 
school now resembles UCLA more than the small, 
private cdlleges after which it was modeled. 

We have to give up even marginally big name 
bands like the U ntouchbles or else find more room for 
the shows. 

Better yet, we can build a facility that can handle 
the entertainment and social requirements of a school 
this size. 

There was such a facility proposed several years 
ago. It would have resided either in the canyon behind 
Central Library or where" Mandeville parking" (i.e., 
the pit) now exists. The proposal got nowhere 
because of reluctance from university administrators 
(i.e. , Atkinson). 

In the meantime, we mourn the loss of the intimacy 
of Friday afternoon concerts on the Hump with real 
bands, one of the few campus traditions. It's a loss 
mourned by all those who danced and drank and met 
their lovers there as the sun set in less aggressive and 
"successful" times.

Letters 
'Shakin' , is 
Bad Advice 
Editor: 

--

May 1 ask what was the point of 
the editorial "N otbin' S hakin"7" ( Guar-
dian, Sept. 19). 

Are we to assume that all Greeks 
are elitist and closed-minded, that 
wanting to be part of an established 
group does not permit one to look 
beyond its borders? That wanting to 
meet people and have fun is a crime 
and deliberately shelters the college 
experience? 

Have you noticed as well the over-
whelmingly large Oriental population 
on the UCSD campus? How about 
those for whom English is not a first 
language? Have you noticed the ever-
increasing lines outside the firutRcial 
aid offices during the first weeks of 
school? Clearly not everyone is from 

Beverly HiUs, Del Mar, or Hillsbo-
rough. Nor do tbey all live in dorms. 

What about those Biology, Chem-
istry and Physics majors who are 
planning to devote long years to 
improving our way of life? Does find-
ing a cure for cancer or infectious 
diseases or AIDS not take into 
account "how people relate to each 
other?" How about tbose former 
science majors who are building safer 
cars and airplanes, studying the effec-
tiveness of medicine, building pros-
theses, giving pbysical therapy and 
cleaning up the environment? Are 
these people strangely cut off from 
human relations? 

And more importantly, "try acid 
and dope'"] Considering that these 
drugs are illegal, addictive, expensive 
and in some cases, deadly, do you 
condone this as a prime way to seek 
new experiences? I find it quite ironic 
that recreational drugs that kill brain

Salinas and PRJ Reform 
Can the Mexican 
President Change, 
Modernize the Party? 

By WAYNE A. CORNELIUS 
Director 
Cmiw for U.S.-Medea St .... 

Throughout his campaign for 
the presidency of Mexico, the 
basic elements of Carlos Salinas' 
promised political reform project 
were clear: Its central thrust was, 
and remains, wholesale renova-
tion of the PRl, from the grass-
roots up. This is to be accomp-
lished by improving candidate 
selection, recruiting new cadres 
who can appeal to younger voters 
and to the urban middle class, giv-
ing greater decision-making auto-
nomy to municipal-level PRI 
committees and PRI-affiliated 
public officials, establishing a 
more direct relationship with 
individual citizens and relying less 
upon corporatist "mass" organi-
zations like the PRI-affiliated 
labor unions and their national-
level leaders to deliver the vote. 

The PRJ must "go the base," as 
Salinas' closest political advisor, 
Manuel Camacho, recently in-

sisted. The old corporatist struc-
tures cannot be ignored or dis-
mantled; but their traditional 
monopoly of interest representa-
tion is a luxury that the PRI can 
no longer afford, given the 
strength of the opposition. There-
fore, parallel struct.ures of citizen 
representation must be allowed 
and even encouraged10 develop, 
and alliances must be built with 
them. 

See PRI, pale 3 

years ago will not automatically tum 
students into activists. The world is 
not the same as it was twenty years 
ago; drugs, literature degrees and 
hometowns don't always make for 
excitement. Furthermore, your arti-
cle seemed about as close-minded 
about tbis campus as you accuse the 
returning students of being. Please 
look and listen a little more your-
selves in the future. 

Marlo Dickman 

(Editor's note: the editorial did not 
suggest that only middle class white 
people populated the campus: ,ather, 
it Q.Sked students to look beyond that 
group.) 

Jesus Christ 
Misunderstood 
Editor. 

While Derick Scovel makes some 
legitimate point in his "Christian Case 
Against Bush" (Guardian, Sept. 26) 
- namely, that the Reagan-Bush 
administration has not demonstrated 
concern for the poor, the sick and the 
oppressed and hence is not Christian 
- he undermines his argument by 
arrogantly denying the precepts of 
tbe Christian faith. 

"As a future seminarian" (Scovel's 
healthy self-esteem is seen in his use 
of the first person some twenty-five 
times), he feels qualified to explain 
Jesus' true taslt to the rest of us bird-
brains: Jesus' mission was "not ... 
death on the cross or resurrection 
folks," he tells us; rather, it "was to 
bring comfort to the afflicted, good 
news to the poor, and ~." 

As if such goals were mutually 
exclusivel On the contrary, Luke 
4:16-20, which Scovel cites but does 
not quote, finds Jesus quoting Isaiah 
61: 1-2 and thereby affirming that his 
mission is both "to preach good news 
to the poor" and "to proclaim release 
to the captives." 

Isaiah explains further the nature 
of the Messiah', "release to the cap-
tives" in what scholan call the Songs 
of the Suffering Servant (Ch. 42-S3). 
For example,lsaiah S3 states that the 
Servant will die in order to "make 
himself an offering for sin"; that "he 
bore the sin of many" and "with his 
stripes we are healed." In other words, 
Jesus proclaims release to the cap-
tives of sin through his own sacrificial 
death. 

Christ'S death and subsequent 
resurrection have been the focal points 
of the Christian faith since Jesus 
ascended irto the heavens. The Apos-

Q & A: How important were the Summer Olympics to you this year? 

I think the Olympics 
are very important. I 
watched most of the 
events. It s really nice to 
see all the countries com-
pete in a friendly way, 
Just the whole thing is 
spectacular.

AI Salinas himself said Iut 
May, "Some traditional groups in 
the Party will have to recognize 
the new popular organizations 
that are emerJing, .. outside of the 
traditional corporatist structures. 
"That will cause some tremon," 
he went on. "These groups are 

They wert:n't incredi-
bly important because 
they'rejust so overrated. 
They get boring.

used to followinl directions from 
the top, and not allowinl new 
leaders to emerae." 

Listeninl. to Salinas and 
Camacho in the pre-election peri-
od, one could almost hear tbem 
quoting Tip O'Neill's maxim that 
"all politics is local." I n his key-
note' address to the Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies' Eilhth

naiists, in June, 1988, Camacho

I thought they were 
more important and more 
exciting before they be-
gan. Then I saw the Rus-
sians win all the gold. 
Track and Field was most 
exciting to watch because 
it was the most compe-
titive.

The only important 
thing was Ben Johnson 
asfar as I'm concerned. I 
think he was framed. I 
didn't like the coverage

This year:SO Summer 
Olympics were important 
because most of the major 
countries were finally 
participating. That made 
it a greater test for the 
athletes competing - it 
set a higher goalfor them 
to achieve.

Crucifixion 
Essential 
Continued from pale 4 

-tie Paul, a prophet of the early 
church, writes, "The word of the 
cross is folly to those who are per-
ishing, but to us who are saved it 
is the power of God . "(I Corinthi-
ans I: 18). Later in the same letter 
(1.5: 14) Paul declares , "If Christ 
has not been raised. then our 
preaching is in vain and your faith 
is in vain." 

Scovel's religion, like that of 
many of today's rationalist Bible 
scholars and leftist theologians, is 
based on a hermeneutics of so-
phistry. He has no trouble accept-
ing the fact that W Jesus healed all 
who were afflicted with diseases 
that came to him," yet he views 
with utter condescension the eye-
witness accounts of Christ's re-
surrection. Where is his consis-
tency? After all, a miracle is a 
miracle.

By J. BERESFORD-HOWE 
Opinion £diror 

1 fe ll in love this summer. 
Presses did not stop, peace did 

not come to warring nations and 
Elvis did not come back to life. 

In the course of your life, it's 
not much, but in the course of 
mine, it's an astonishing event. 

1 was pretty trashed after my 
last love affair; as Mississippi 
John Hurt would have said, wThis 
ain't a song about broken hearts, 
but broken hearts are in it." 

1 was about as ready for a lover 
as I am now for Dan Quayle to be 
president. On top of that, the 
woman 1 fell for already had a 

boyfriend, one she said she loved. 
He lives in Spain, thank God . 

but all of their copious corre-
pondence is in Spanish, so there it 
was all aroulld me when I visited 
her: T he evidence of their love 
beyond my hopelessly Anglo 
understanding. 

I tried real hard to convince her 
that she should love me. I did all 
the things 1 could think of to 
court her; 1 took her to see the 
Grateful Dead, I bought her roses, 
1 listened intently during an awful 
period of depression she suffered . 
I even comforted her about her 
boyfriend and the tToubles she 
had with him. 

On my birthday, we went out 
for a friendly drink. Later, when I 

thought I might have a drinking 
problem, she listened while I 
poured out my heart. 

Mostly, 1 pursued and she fled. 
It went on like this for months. 
We'd try and be friends, but mut-
ual attraction would rear its head 
and ... we'd have to start all over 
again. 

This was unusual for me. I 
started living with my last girl-
friend on the first date. We slept 
together before the first date . 
Before that, I was pursued by a 
staff writer here; later a lesbian 
trying out guys rushed me hard. 
We slept together the first time we 
went out. I always sleep with 
someone on the first date. Call me 
loose. 

Anyway, through all this chase 
bet ween this oman and I, we fall 
in love. I guess you could say we 
had the time to get to know each 
other and learn about each other 
without the pressure of a relation-
shi p. 1 guess you could say we 
discovered that there are things 
more important than sex and 
immediate attraction. 

This is a fable for the era of 
restraint in love, of waiting for the 
right time. It took six months 
between the time we met each 
other and the fint time we could 
say, "I love you." 

We did sleep together the first 
time we went out. We slept to-
gether after that. 

wThe right time" is a fable, not 
this story.

Customers Keep Her On Campus 

The Flower Lady Helps Students Bloom 
By DENISE DADOR 
Staff Wriur 

Students walking between the Student Center and the quad 
are greeted each morning 

by the sweet smell of roses and the 
welcoming smile of "the flower 
lady. " 

Some students may not notice 
the colorful cart full of assorted 
posies, yet countless others find 
the flower service indispensible 
and the flower lady's advice to be 
priceless. 

For six years Aurora Evora has 
been running a flower stand in 
front of the Crafts Center. She is 
affectionately called "Tita" (the 
Filipino word for aunt) because 
many students feel she is part of 
their family. 

"She's always asking about 
your classes and how you are. She 
really cares," Third College senior 
Arnold Villaluz said. 

Evora, 58, goes about her daily 
routine like clockwork. She rises 
at the crack of dawn to begin her 
morning ritual of cooking, clean-
ing and tending to her aging 
mother. 

After finishing her housework, 
she picks up her wares, sets out to 

the flower mart, and prepares to 
spend the day sharing her life 
experiences and wisdom with 
students. 

Evora's gentle face and unceas-
ing impish grin do not reveal her 
many years of challenges and dif-
ficulties, nor her recent bout with 
cancer. 

"I know how these kids feel 
when they come up to me with 
their problems, because I've been 
through it too," she said with a 
compassionate tone. 

"I tell them that whatever is 
bothering them now will be 
looked back upon and laughed 
about later," Evora said. 

In 1979, Evora was diagnosed 
as having breast cancer. She 
sought medical help in the Phi-
lippines where she underwent 
extensive chemotherapy and radia-
tion treatment which caused her 
hair to fan out. She eventually 
became better, and attributes her 
"miraculous" recovery to her 
strong faith in God. 

Evora began her vending ser-
vice in 1982 when her niece and 
nephew were attending UCSD. 
She said they decided to start the 
business to keep her from early 
retirement in the Philippines. 

" When I first started, in 

December of that year, it was so 
cold, 1 wanted to go back home," 

'she said, shivering. "But when 
students started coming up to me, 
I decided to stay." 

The satisfaction of her work, 
Evora said, does not come from 
the small amount of flowers that 
she sells, but from the joy of giv-
ing a little happiness to every per-
son she comes in contact with. 

"I'm not going to get rich with 
this business," she said. "But I feel 
that I'm needed. Rain or shine I'm 
here because people look forward 
to seeing me here." 

The flower lady's new niche 
was soon threatened by the Uni-
versity'S fear that too many 
venders were invading campus 
grounds. 

.. At the time, the place looked 
like a swap meet and the school 
started throwing vendors out," 
Evora said. 

Luckily, one of the most heart-
warming events of her life 
occured when thousands of stu-
dents and profess-ors rallied 
behind her to keep her on 
campus. 

"I remember they were all lined 
up to sign the petition 1 was so 
touched," Evora said. She ex-
plained that her contract will once 
again be in question soon, with

the opening of the new University 
Center next year. 

Evora is not only generous 
when it comes to matters of tbe 
heart, but also extends her gener-
osity to her business. 

"Sometimes students will come 
up to me and tell me they don't 
have enough money for the flow-
ers," she explained. "I usually just 

give it to them and tell them to 
pay me later. And they do." 

The flower stand bas also 
become one of the school's most 
visible hangout areas. 

"It·s a great place to get to 
know people and make new 
friends, and it's also a convenient 
place to meet," Villaluz said.

Bullfighting's Appeal Varies 
By ROB WARD 
Contributing Wril~r 

I went to tbe Tijuana Plaza de 
Toros with an open mind and a 
strong constitution. During the 
first bullfight, however, a queasy 
feeling crept over me. I became 
thoroughly nauseated. 

The crowd had not yet arrived 
in sufficient numbers to generate 
a distracting atmosphere, so our 
attention was directed to the 
uncompetitive nature of the con-
tests between matadors and bulls. 

Although we were led to believe 
that the bulls have some chance to 
threaten and even inflict harm on 
the bullfighters, this was clearly 
not the case. 

Whenever there was a chance 

ofthe bull gaining some initiative, 
the training matadors jumped into 
the ring to distract and tire out the 
animal. 

When the bull was sufficiently 
exhausted from chasing red and 
pink rags around the bullring, the 
picadors came in and literaUy 
drained the life blood from the 
confused animals. 

The picadors, dressed like gla-
diators, rode horses clad in chain 
mail to protect the animals from 
tbe jabs of tbe raging bulls. 

The picadors were always booed 
when they entered tbe ring, be-
cause their arrival signified the 
beginning ofthe end for the bulls. 

The bulls were teased into 
attacking the thick layers of pad-
ding on the underbellies of the 
horses. Then the picadors, amidst 

further booing, pierced the bulls' 
bodies with sharp lancets. The 
lancets had sharp hooks on their 
tips. 

The incision made at the back 
of the bull's head by the lancet is 
supposed to make the animal 
more angry. It appeared, how-
ever, to drain a great deal of its 
blood, and many bulls seemed to 
be considerably weakened soon 
after the picador's attack. 

The bull is not the only beast to 
suffer. A blindfolded horse took a 
violent thrust to its underbeUy. 
Horses were sometimes knocked 
over. OccasionaUy, a horse will 
have to be killed after a bad fall. 

After having been worn down 
by the training matadors and

"There's no one group resposi-
ble for this. The main problem 
seems to be the lack of a facility 
for this kind of activity. Hope-
fully, this will generate some kind 
of action towards building an 
adequate amphitheater of concert 
venue," Weintraub said. 

Judaken sees the whole inci-
dent as an indication of UCSD's 
need for a real amphitheatre specifi-
cally desi,ned for large scale 
programrrung losses. 

Although the event ended u~­
successfully, Judaken finds a POSI-
tive aspect in it. He described the 
excitement of the incident as a 
rebellion against the apathy that 
has typified the University in the 
past.

the meetings is 'Do the students

a,ed over a six-month period) to 
receive benefits, some members 
of the undergraduate AS see this 
as a hindrance for undergraduate 
employees. 

It is their contention that the 
University will cut work weeks 
for all students to 17.S hours to 
get away from benefit responsibil-
ities when all that most under-
graduates are concerned with are 
the number of hours they can 
work to make money. 

If a benefit package of this kind 
were passed it could create shor-
ter work weeks for everyone. 

In addition to the open forums, 
Gardner is having a special dinner 
at his home on Oct. 7 for the pres-
ident. of the underaradilate and 
graduat~ student aslociations 
from all UC campUICI. 

On Sept. I S an appeal was 
made by Gil Gott, a member of 
the UCSA Board of Directors, to 
the Board of Regents regardinl 
student employment health in-
lurance. 

In his address Gott stated that 
"Those in the teachinl assistant 
and research assistant job classifi-
cations have long suffered from 
their inability to enjoy the full 
fruits of their service to the 
University. " 

Gott went on to say that "stu-
dent employees are often the back-
bone of an academic department, 
providinl the teachinl and re-
search support necessary to 
achieve the University's mission."

All Types of People Can 
Afford to Donate Blood 
By CHRIS KRANTZ 
Guardia" I"'~", 

A few years ago, I was struck 
by an automobile while riding my 
bicycle. I broke both arms and my 
right leg, and lost a lot of blood, 
so much that I almost bled to 
death. 

r n the emerlency room, durinl 
the first operation, 1 received two 
vital blood transfusions. By the 
t ime I checked out of the hosptial, 
nearly five months later, I had 
u d . h t n ergone ell t &epara e opera-
t ions, each one requirinl ·blood. 

I received a great deal of blood 
rom people I had never met. To f 

t 
Ie. 
h 

his day, I wonder if these people 
new what a truly great thing they 
ad done. 
Thanks to the Blood Reserve 

F und and the anonymous volun-
cers, blood is available to those 
n need. 

This Wednesday, Thursday and 
Fgday the San Diego Blood Bank 
w ill conduct their quarterly Blood 
Drive on the UCSD campus. 
Anyone in good health between 
the ages of 18 and 6S , and weigh-
ing 110 pounds or more, may 
donate. 

The only way to replenish the 
UCSD Blood Reserve Fund is 
through volunteer donations, so 

volunteers are very important. 
I was lucky; blood was availa-

ble when I nceded it. However, 
this vital fluid isn't always so plen-
tiful. Today, there is a shonage. 
I n fact, some operations are post-
poned because the Blood Bank 
docs not have the patient's blood 
type in stock. 

Also, there is often a blood· 
shortage during the holiday sea-
son due to the rise in accidents 
and the subsequent increase in 
demand for blood . 

Today, the shortage of blood is

compounded by the fear of con-
tracting AIDS. Many potential 
vol unteers do not give blood be-
cause of their fear and ignorance. 

It is tremendously important 
for the public to know that it is 
impossible to contract AIDS by 
donating blood. 

All equipment used during a 
blood donation is sterile and has 
never been used before. The San 
Diego Blood Bank meets or 
exceeds all federal and state regu-
lations which protect the blood

With the Blood Bank 's system 
of UCSD volunteers, donation 
not only provides a means of 
replenishing the UCSD Blood 
Reserve Fund, but will also allow 
the donor to receive low cost 
blood when needed without hav-
ing to pay the replacement fee: a 
fee rarely covered in health insu-
rance plans. This opportunity is 
available to UCSD students, staff 
a nd faculty, and their immediate 
families. 

Donating blood takes about 4S 
minutes. Aside from the needle 
prick, it is a relatively painless 
process, and that tiny prick of 
pain produces an incredible 
amount of benefits. 

Most of the donor's time is 
spent answering questions to in-
sure his or her safety and the 
safety of the person who will

Salinas and 
PRJ Talk 
Reform 
Continued from plge 5 
election, this year); also to im-
prove the competitiveness of the 
PRJ, by forcing its candidates for 
municipal offices and for con-
gres·sional seats to earn their nom-
inations and their general-election 
victories, campaigning door-to-
door and not just waiting for the 
big unions or other sectoral organ-
izations to deliver the vote. 

There is also a larger, hidden 
agenda at work here: Salinas and 
his group can try to engineer pol-
itical modernization from above; 
but they know that the durable 
success of any such effort will 
depend on growing pressure from 
below - hence the importance 
they attach to energizing the 
grassroots. 

But introducing this new brand 
of competitive politics at the local 
level would, of course, mean tak-
ing greater political risks: the 
risks of exacerbating local div-
isions; oflosing centralized politi-
cal control, if the traditional PRJ 
control agents - the caciquel -
are to be shunted aside in favor of 
modern-style cadres. And many 
more opposition party victories at 
local and state levels would have 
to be recognized, if the reform 
project is to have any credibility. 
This would end the traditionally 
secure allotments of public offices 
to each of the PRJ sectors and 
their national-level bosses. And if 
local official holders and even 

state governors actually owed 
their positions to their constitu-
ents, and had the autonomy to 
resolve conflicting demands with-
out instructions from Mexico 
City, this would also signify a 
dilution of presidential power. 

Salinas and his advisors seem 
willing to take these kinds of 
risks. New limits on presidential 
power, for example, are accepted 
as a necessary accommodation to 
the new political realities of the 
country. Salinas' position is that 
the presidency and its relation-
ship to other elements ofthe polit-
ical system - including the fed-
eral Congress - can be mod-
ernized without fundamentally 
weakening the presidentiaJ institution. 

Greater autonomy in candidate 
selection at lower levels ofthe sys-
tem may prevent Salinas and his 
successors from imposing close 

OPINIoN 
stemming from the numerous 
state and local elections to be held 
during Salinas' presidency are 
going to be averted. In Salinas' 
view, the PRI can no longer 
afford to be the party of the old, 
the poor, and the rural-dweller -
and certainly not during an ad-
ministration whose constant battle--
cry is "modernization." 

At the same time, Salinas is , 
above all, a pragmatist. He wants 
to reform the PRJ, and at least 
some elements of the broader pol-
itical system, without tearing it 
apart. He will resist raising the 
level of conflict within the na-
tional political elite to the point 
where it becomes disruptive to the 
economic recovery and to the pol-
itical reform effort itself. 

Indeed, Salinas' group believes 
that the system can't be reformed, 
if the level of conflict gets too high 
- if the basic unity of the PRJ is 

friends or political allies in some broken. Any such "implosion" of 
ofthese positions; but the overall the PRJ could lead to a power-
gains in legitimacy and mass sup- vacuum, and even provoke vio-
port for presidential policies will lence. The strategy, as Manuel 
offset this disadvantage. Similar- Camacho has described it, is to

accountability to the legislative inevitable conflict" with anti-re--

The UCSD Guardian 

the election results have been 
under attack from the "dinosaurs" 
of the PRJ for "capitUlating"; for 
being too eager to grant conces-
sions and bargain away power, 
piecemeal, to an "insolent" and 
ungrateful opposition. 

Opposition tactics like the dis-
ruption of outgoing President De 
la Madrid's state-of-the-nation 
address on September ) have only 
emboldened the "dinos" and har-
dened their resistance to the kinds 
of political changes advocated by 
the Salinas group. Eighty-six-year-
old Fidel Velazquez, helld of the 
PRJ-affiliated national labor con-
federation (CTM), now mourns 
the "useless sacrifice" of 16 of 
"his" Congressional seats that 
were awarded to the opposition 
parties, and vows to go it alone in 
"attacking the enemy as best 
serves the CTM's interests, not 
what suits certain politicians in 
the country." 

Salinas has already made 
major concessions to the tradi-
tional forces in the PRJ. He did so 
in approving a list of PRJ candi-
dates for Congress that included 
numerous favorites of the old-
guard who were notorious for 
their corruption - the very anti-
thesis of Salinas' po/itica mOo 
demo. He appears to have made 
major concessions to PRJ hard-
liners in the handling of the elec-
tion results. And in his selection 
of a cabinet, he will probably try 
again to gain the cooperation of 
the old-guard by choosing a mix 
of Salinas-style technocrats and 
traditional politicians.

Science professor, prelented this

ar at UCSD on Sept. 21 .

Bullfight 
Continued from pale 8 
drained of blood by the picadors. 
t he bulls had to face the actual 
matadors. 

Dressed in brightly colored 
clothes and petite shows, the 
matadors were the stars of the 
show for bullfighting enthusiasts. 

For some of us, though, the 
magnificent and seemingly proud 
bulls were the main attraction. 
These beasts put on a great dis-
play of tenacity and endurance. 

During the first two bulls, the 
spectacle was nothing more than 
appalling for most of us. We 
could not undentand what the 
attraction was of such a one-sided 
affair where the matadors prance 
around the ring for 20 minutes, 
humiliating bulls who have no 
real gumption for the conflict. 

After the initial shock, how-
ever, the occasion could almost 
be seen as an enjoyable spectacle. 
As the quality of the bullfighting 
improved, and as the crowd 
became increasingly enthusiastic, 
some meaning could be seen in 
this "sport." 

The fifth bull was plucky,lined 
up against the local hero, Manolo 
Arruza. The bull was much larger 
than its predecessors, and, after a 
relatively long period of time, 
Arruza managed to manipUlate 
the bull into submission. 

To prove his superiority, and as 
part ofthe ritual, Arruza touched 
the exhausted bull's horns. The 
crowd gasped in admiration be-
fore Arruza finally put the bull 
out of its misery with a sword 
aimed at the animal's heart. 

After losing a great deal of 
blood by the matador's sword, 
the bull was finished off by a final 
attacker, who stabbed the bull in 
the head with a small knife. 

Arruza was given two of the 
bull's ears, which, according to 
ritual, signify that the matador 
fought well . Giving the matador 
two ears and the tail would be the 
highest honor, while giving him 

, ju~t cne ear is slightly less honor-
able. 

Members oft he audience threw 
shoes and red roses into the arena 
as a display of their approval. 

The reaction of the crowd and 
of the officials determine the suc-
cess of the matador. 

A bull's only chance at survival 
is putting up an incredible fight, 
before it is too late. 

One bull refused to die, in spite 
of various knives and swords stuck 
in its back. Although the crowd 

I cheered it on yeiling, "Term! 
Torro!"the bull was soon beyond 
saving. 

After a day at the bullring, 1 
decided that [ would net return to 
the Plaza de Toros unless paid to 
do so.

Others accept Evora's presence 
as a natural-occurrence. 

"I never really thought about

Salunga. "You don't really think

Other students find the flower

"She knoWli everything that's

Mike Nepomuceno. "She's also a 
notorious matchmaker." 

Evora recalled a time when two 
boys were trying to court the 

same girl. The two boys instruc-
ted Evora to give flowers to her 
everyday. 

"The first boy would come up 
to me and then the second boy 
WOUld. Jt really got very confus-

chuckled. 

The flower lady said that when 
students come up to her and pour 
out their unbearable sorrows, she 
tries to deal with them as if they 
were her sons or daulhters. She 
said that when students are going 
through hard times she helps 
them most by praying for them. 

Evora said that her continuing 
love for the students at UCSD has 
given her a new lease on life and a 
reason to look forward to each

that I'm appreciated. Jt's a great

Intro. to The Short Story 
When Carla told me that my date 

was a little short, I thought she was 
talking dollars and cents, not feet and 
inche . So there I was at the door, in 
my spiked heels staring at the top of 
my date's head. 

All I cou ld thirik was, how do I 
get myselfout of this? I could imagine 
how my legs would ache if! had to walk 
arou nd with my knees bent all evening. 

So to stall for time, while figuring 
out how to fake malaria, I made u 
some Double Dutch C hocolate. 

When I brought it into the living 
room, I discovered that Garv was 
a chocolate lovertoo. Ahh, a man 
after my own heart. Okay, I de-
cided 18 give him a chance. So we 

sat down and saw each othcr face-
to-face tor the fir t time. He had a 
nice smile. 

After ome ~mall ta lk- I mean 
convers;ltiol1-1 d i cO\'cred that we 
both love Updike, hate the winter 
wcather, and both have m in ia-
tu re schnauzers. So, we madc 
a date to introduce Shadow 
and Schatzi next week.

Continued from pale 24 
any more of a hindrance to the 
T riton offense, as they went down 
18·). UCSD's designated perime-
ter shooter Dave Calder burned 
five into the net. Jason Brown, 
the man Harper is hoping will 
pick up the slack from the gra-
duation loss of two prolific scor-
ers, tallied four from the hole. 

Ti)e Tritons now gear up for 
their biggest challenge of the sea-
son, as they head north to Pep-
perdine for their first dual game 
of the year this Friday. Harper 
previewed the confrontation with 

the twelfth ranked Waves as 
"rather interesting and pressure-
filled. especially since well be the 
favored team." 

Harper has dubbed this year's 
group, his ninth, as the "team that 
needs to break through and win 
the crunch-time games, stop the 
late-minute and one-goal losses, 
and blown leads that we've been 
giving away the last couple of 
years. " 

The Pepperdine game could be 
the time to find out what this 
team is made of, in addition to 
how they stack up against Div-
ision I competition. 

"It's not going to be easy, but 
we'l welcome the challenge," 
acknowledged Harper.

UCSD -2 Redlands 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS .. This one is easy. The 10-0-1 
Tritons, including Saturday night's 1-0 defeat of Cal-
Poly Pomona, now have nine shutouts and have 
demolished the opponent 414 this year. The Triton 
defense has been virtually impenetrable, and so far 
nobody has been able to figure out how to stop fresh-
man Katy Dulock from scoring a goal every three 
minutes. Considering those facts, a miniscule two 
point spread, the home field advantage (today, Warren 
Field, 2:30 p.m.), and the automatic assumption that 
Redlands is soup, Phil recommends that you .. .

M.Soccer 
Continued from pale 24 
Cal Lutheran, whose record was 
1-2-2. 

Coach Derek Armstrong was 
equally upset. "I'm not happy ... 
we didn't play particularly well," 
he commented. Armstrong at-
tributed the average play of the 
team to a "normal slump" that 
occurs once classes start. The soc-
cer team has been playing for six 
weeks, but school just began. 

Although the B.G.l .F. helped 
to promote Friday afternoon's 
soccer game, only about 75 peo-
ple turned out to watch. 

Yesterday, the UCSD Tritons 
exploded against Pomona-Pitzer 
and smashed them, 10-0. It was 
field day for the 10-0-1 Tritons, as 
both Chris Hanssen and Shahin 
Alavi each scored twice. 

The Tritons are looking ahead 
to strong competition when they 
face San Bernardino on the road 
Friday at 3:00 p.m.

V olleyball Loss to Biola 
Could Prove Beneficial 
By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Contributing Writ., 

Following a sub par perfor-
manee in Friday night's five-game 
loss to Biola, their second loss in a 
row, the UCSD Women's Vol-
leyball squad can only hope that 
history repeats itselfthis year. In 
the last two years, the Tritons 
have lost regular season contests 
to Biola but have nevertheless 
gone on to win the NCAA Div-
ision III National Championship. 

"It's some consolation know-
ing that every year that we've lost 
to Biola we've come back and 
won the national title, head coach 
Doug Dannevik said. "We knew 
the jitters would hit us, being such 
a young team, so now it's just a 
matter of working harder to make 
fewer mistakea like the ones we 
made tonight." 

us ," Dannevik said. ") think it will 
only make the girls work harder 
in the future ." 

Dannevik's words may have 
had immediate impact. Saturday 
night the Tritons turned around 
and crushed Cal St. Dominguez 
Hills, 15-2, 15-8 and 15-7. Rachel 
Vetter delivered II kills to lead 
UCSD to its 21st victory of the 
year against only one defeat. 

Tuesday the Triton's women 
travel to UC Riverside for a 7:30 
p.m. contest.

Indeed, after falling behind 14-
3 in the third game, a fantastic 
Triton run of eight straight points 
was not enough as Biola went on 
to win, IS-II. 

The comeback that almost was 
prompted Dannevik to proclaim 
afterward: "In the long run, that 
rally really tired us out. It hurt us 
in the last two matches." 

In the fifth match, the Tritons' 
inexperience proved costly when 
points were lost because some 
Triton women touched the net. 

Nevertheless, the squad's goal 
of repeating last year's title has 
not been severely damaged. 

"We've been winning one's like 
this all year, so it shouldn't hurt 

sport as It IS a phYSical one. It IS 
important to be psyched up for a 
race. There are a variety of phil-
osophies. Beer and Doritos while

Cult is freshman Ivan Carlos' lcey

Grinnell sUllests loading up on 
carbohydrates two nights before. 

The tightly-knit team would 
appreciate more fan support-
actually any support. In any case, 
the cross country team is setting 
the pace for a successful year. 
"We will be: real competitive," 
Stanforth said . "We have a good 
chance at winning the Regionals 
and qualifying for the Nationals. " 

The cross country team com-
petes in the: Biola ) nvitational

Big Wins on Friday May Have Created Letdown 

Long Beach St. Crushes Tritons in Water Polo 
By DANA CHAIKEN 
Contributing Writer 

The eighth ranked UCSD 
Men's Water Pol team won two 
out ofthree gaml. this past week-
end at Canyonview Pool, but 
still failed to triumph in the one it 
really wanted to claim. 

With Saturday night's 8-3 loss 

to fifth ranked Cal State Long 
Beach, the 9-8 Tritons got what 
Coach Denny Harper called "a 
dose of reality," after easy victo-
ries on Friday. 

About what could have been 
UCSD's first-ever win over a top-
five team, Harper remorsed, "It 
was a great opportunity that we 
didn't take advantage of, espe-
cially because Long Beach is a

H artmannFinishes Second 
in UCSD Invitational 

By MOLLY McKAY 
Contributing Writer 

The starting gun sends the 
athletes running off straight 
into the woods. The deter-
mined runners begin the 
treacherous course through 
eucalyptus trees, up moun-
tainous terrain, and around 
narrow paths. No, it's not 
another episode of Monty 
Python, it is the annual 
UCSD Cross Country Invi-
tational, held Saturday near 
the Supercomputer on the 
Third College campus. 

Participants described the 
route as "grueling" and "ex-

tremely challenging." Sopho-
more Steve Bramson printed 
out that, "Even the most 
careful of runners can trip 
over hidden roots or lose 
footing on the loose gravel -
there is a lot of risk involved." 

The result of the informal 
meet proved that UCSD will 
be a fighting force in its div-
ision. In the men's 8K race, 
David Hasseltine ofUC Irvine 
headed the pack but fresh-
men Eric Kinney and Tom 
Zoin finished tightly behind 
one another in eighth and 
ninth place out of 36 runners. 

In the women's SK, Wendy 
Peterson (an unattached run-
ner) took first with a time of 
19:11 , with Tessie Hartmann 
of UCSD finishing directly 
behind at 19:34. 

" It is hard for other people 
to understand how running 
8-15 miles a day can be en-
joyable," said Coach Mark 
Stanforth. "It takes strong 
mental commitment and 
strength to run cross country." 

"Why do we run? It is 
becau e we are masochists," 
said H os Khaleeli. Seriously, 
one doe have to marvel at 
the dedication of the team. 
Why would someone spend 
two hours a day doing 'fart-
leks' (interval training), 
weights, and ju t plain run-
ning?" 

"It put you in perfect 
shape, plus it is gratifying to 
see your improvement," said 
Hartmann. "Busting your a-
seven days a week and 15 
miles a day build character," 
said ? 

Coach Stanforth encour-
ages a po itive and non-
threatening atmosphere. "I 
don't believe in the football 
mentality . . . yelIing and

team we usually play very well 
against." 

He cited the game as the Trit-
on's "worst effort ofthe year" and 
"an embarrassing performance. " 

It didn't look that way from the 
start, though, as UCSD came out 
strong and scored the game's first 
goal in a man-up situation. Dave 
Calder scored to give the team 
what proved to be its only lead of 
the contest. 

The Forty-Niners from Long 
Beach answered back a minute 
later with a lob shot which barely 
cleared 6'6" goalie Randy Franke's 
outstretched arms. 

Cal State Long Beach scored . 
two more goals in the second 
period, including a painful one 
for UCSD at the halftime buzzer. 
Then Forty-Niner Darin Blizzard 
found the net after Franke had 
successfully blocked two consecu-
tive shots. 

Long Beach extended its lead 
to 7-1 in what Harper disgustedly 
labeled "a second-half disaster," 
before UCSD managed another 
goal at 5:44 of the final period. 
Team co-captain Tom Schatz 
scored oIJa beautiful pass from 

Todd Sells, a sequence that 
brought forth tremendous cheers 
from the crowd of several hun-
dred. 

Jason Vancefmished the game's 
scoring when one of his shots 
caught a wave past the Niners' 
reserve goalie. 

Coach Harper envisioned the 
match being more in the range of 
a tie or a one-goal difference, and 
called the team's three goals 
"pathetic." He did note, on the 
other hand, that the eight goals 
they conceded "weren't a lot. I 
never thought we'd hold them 
under double digits." 

That one positive aspect can be 
attributed to the special drop-
back defense which shut down 
Long Beach's top player, as well 
as to the performance of goalie 
Franke. Unofficially, he recorded 
12 saves. "It's difficult to ask a 
goalie to stop a counter-attack. 
He did what he could," Harper 
said of Franke. 

Long Beach's counter-attack 
proved to be the difference in the 
game, as they cashed in for sev-
eral goals on breakaways after 
the Tritons' offense failed to exe-

cute, especially in key man-up 
situations. 

Harper summed up the per-
formance by explaining, "Games 
like this happen. I just keep think-
ing of yesterday, and I just know 
that we weren't mentally ready to 
deal with this." 

In Friday's games, UCSD illus-
trated why they feel without ques-
tion that they're one of the top 
teams in Division III, even though 
they play in the NCAA Open Div-
ision against all levels of teams, 
including Division I and II. 

In the opener of the double-
header, the Tritons showed no 
mercy as they toyed with what 
can only be described as a weak 
Occidental team, with a final score 
of 28-3. 

Every player scored as the team 
managed a goal a minute. Joe 
Risse, one of a trio of freshmen on 
an otherwise veteran squad, led 
the way with five goals, followed 
by Jason Vance, Aaron Arm-
strong, and Tom Schatz all with 
three. 

In the second game, Loyola 
Marymount did not prove to be

5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... I ... 0 ... and 
time expires. The UCSD Men's 
Soccer team wins again, this time 
by a score of 2~ over visiting Cal 
Lutheran last Friday. 

One would expect to see some 
celebration on the Triton bench 
after their ninth -victory of the 
season, but the enthusiasm was 
not there. Instead, the entire Men's 
Soccer team, including coach 
Derek Armstrong, sat quietly on 
the bench, extremely disappointed 
in the way they had played. 

The Tritons began the game 
slowly, missing easy passes and 
not working together. With 34:54 
gone in the first half, sophomore 
Alex Savala nailed what was to be 
the only goal of the half, on an 
assist from Mike Bradley. 

When the Tritons returned in 
the second half, they seemed more 
coord inated and aggressive . 
Strong defense continued to keep 
Cal Lutheran scoreless. 

Twenty minutes into the half, 
Mike Alberts, as isted by Scott 
Goodman, drove in the Triton's 
second goal. Thi goal woke up 
the quiet crowd of spectators. 

More hots were taken by the 

Triton offense, but were neverthe-
less denied by the Cal Lutheran 
goalie. The Tritons had no trou-
ble moving the ball down the 
field, yet failed to capitalize. 

However, the game clock even-
tually ran out and UCSD put the 
eighth shutout ofthe season under 
its belt. 

Their record of 9-0-1 keeps the 
Tritons atop the rankinp in the 
Far West region. 

Over on the Triton bench, how-
ever, there was no celebrating. 
Triton players did not want to 
talk about the game. They had 
expected to play better against

All the Cal St. Lutheran goalie needed to do was wave and blow in 
order to minimize the Triton offense Saturday. UCSD lost, 8-3.
