The A.S. Council excused six senators from possible impeachment last night, 
including A.S. President-elect Wafa 
Ben Hassine. 

Although only three weeks 
remain until the 2010-11 student 
council takes office, A.S. Advocate 
General Parminder Sandhu sub-
mitted six resolutions to impeach 
councilmembers who have consis-
tently missed council or committee 

meetings.
According to the A.S. con-

stitution, voting members who 
receive more than three unexcused 
absences are subject to impeach-
ment. During Winter Quarter, the 
council voted to impeach Biological 
Sciences Senator John Ehrhart 
and Sixth College Senator Kevin 
Nguyen.

The six senators considered 
for impeachment yesterday were 
Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey, with 
three absences; Revelle Senator 
Arvind Satyanarayan, with five 

absences; Campuswide Senator 
Adam Kenworthy, with three 
absences; Campuswide Senator 
Desiree Prevo, with three absences, 
Campuswide Senator Ben Hassine, 
with three-and-a-half absences; and 
Arts & Humanities Senator Omar 
Khan, with eight absences.

Because roll is called twice dur-
ing each Wednesday-night meeting, 
an absence during either call counts 
as half an absence.

Sandhu said there is still value 
in pursuing impeachments, despite 
the short amount of time the cur-

rent council has left in office.
“I think that, at this point, it’s 

really the principle — a lot of these 
people who are being impeached, 
one was impeached before but 
it failed, so we’re doing it again,” 
Sandhu said.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
he believes that excessive unex-
cused absences negatively affect 
the accountability of the governing 
body.

I-House 
Denies Bias 
in Selection 
Procedure

By Kelly Kim
Staff Writer

Having concluded a 10-day investigation into 
the integrity of UCSD’s International House admis-
sions policies, administrators are denying allega-
tions that their selection process is racially biased.

Though I-House Director Christi Gilhoi did not 
release any specific details about the investigation, 
she said that both the UCSD Office of Campus 
Counsel and an outside statistical analyst were con-
tacted to review the admissions procedure.

“The study found no evidence of bias with 
respect to cultural categories,” Gilhoi said. “Our 
legal counsel has identified no legal problems with 
the admissions process.”

The review was launched on April 10, after the 
system came under fire last month when Gilhoi 
mistakenly sent a confidential e-mail to everyone 
on the I-House listserv. 

The e-mail — which was sent to all current 
I-House residents — contained a spreadsheet with 
the personal information of 148 students who 
applied to live in I-House during Fall Quarter 
2009. Some students who received the information 
expressed concern over columns on the spread-
sheet that identified the “citizenship” and “cultural 
identity” of applicants.

Gilhoi said that indicating one’s cultural iden-
tity and national origin is an optional component 
of the application.

For seven years, California students have been fighting for a bill that would provide financial aid to undocumented immigrants. The existing law AB 540 allows long-time California residents 
without official citizenship to pay in-state tuition at public 
universities, but does not provide that they receive aid. 

Under the California Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors Act, AB 540 students would 
be able to receive financial aid from the state — which 
proponents say is a major step toward making a col-
lege education accessible to students who have not been 
granted U.S. citizenship.

Carmina Ocampo, a lawyer for the Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center, said that  — despite the high 
profile of the bill — there remain misconceptions about 
it would work and who it would impact. One common 
assumption is that most students protected by AB 540 are 
immigrants from Latin America. In fact, almost half are 
Asian-American. 

“It’s surprising, because there’s a widespread stereo-
type that Asian-Americans are the model minority,” she 
said. “They seem privileged in terms of education and 
finances and are overrepresented in academic institutions 
 — but they can actually be a vulnerable and marginalized 
group that come from poor families struggling to pay for

vote and to represent,” he said. “If they 
are absent, they are not representing. 
They are not being [senators]. I’m con-
cerned that we’re not doing our job to 
police our own council — to the own 
rules that we prescribe by.”

He criticized the senators in ques-
tion for not attempting to excuse their 
absences.

“It is really easy to be excused from 
meetings,” Gupta said. “All you have to 
do is send an email in to the council 
explaining why you need to be absent, 
and you are almost always excused. I 
can’t make excuses for them anymore.”

In the discussion proceeding the 
vote, councilmembers pointed out 
prior mistakes in the absence-counting 
process.

For example, one of Prevo’s 
absences was from a Sun God com-

mittee meeting that she missed on 
Feb. 5. However, she said that she 
had cleared her absence prior to the 
meeting because she had work, and 
that the excusal had not been properly 
recorded. 

“This is ridiculous,” Prevo said. “I 
work really hard, and this is really dis-
respectful. I think this just shows how 
faulty the system is.”

Ben Hassine agreed that the count-
ing system sometimes does not line 
up with the amount of effort council-
members contribute.

“Keep in mind, I’m going to be here 
next year,” she said. “I work hard and 
I usually never miss Senate without 
missing council, and I always try to 
excuse myself.”

Gupta said there was no basis for 
the impeachments being pardoned, 
and that all members in question were 

still eligible for impeachment. Sandhu 
added that he would bring the matter 
to council again. 

According to Sandhu, once a coun-
cilmember accrues more than three 
absences, he submits a resolution for 
impeachment, which is then voted on 
by the Campus Affairs Committee. 
If passed, it is submitted to the entire 
council. Impeachment requires a two-
thirds vote to pass.

Sandhu expressed concern that 
those in associate vice president posi-
tions — who are paid $3,500 per year 
— cannot be impeached, even though 
some of them have accrued as many 
as 13 absences, because of their non-
voting status.

“They have three times as many 
absences as the rest of council, and 
they are subject to the same attendance 
code as senators,” Sandhu said. “Their 

exemption is a double standard.”
He said the council should imple-

ment an AVP impeachment process.
 “Let’s say the Vice President of 

Finance Peter Benesch doesn’t like one 
of his AVPs tomorrow — he can just 
remove them,” he said. “So, at this 
point, it’s hard to remove the AVP, 
because it’s a personal decision. I’m 
trying to find a way to make it less 
of a personal decision and more that 
if you’re not meeting the absence 
requirement, then you immediately 
get punished.”

However, Gupta said AVP absences 
do not affect the council’s operations, 
since AVPs do not have a vote.

tuition.”
Ocampo said the center where she 

works often encounters immigrants 
who come to the U.S. with their 
families on work or visitor visas, only 
to have the documents expire without 
their knowledge. 

“Some students don’t know they’re 
undocumented until they apply 
for a driver’s license, or to college,” 
Ocampo said. “It’s a shock to them, 
and Asian-Americans are an invis-
ible group because they don’t want to 
expose themselves.”

Ocampo’s hypothetical paral-
lels the experience of Michelle*, an 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more and undocumented immi-
grant from Singapore who wished 

to remain anonymous. Michelle said 
that many students in her situation 
are unwilling to speak publicly about 
their immigrant status, which keeps 
others from understanding how 
many students the bill would pos-
tively affect. 

“I came to the United States with 
my mom under her working visa, 
and she was fired for economic situ-
ations,” Michelle said. “We suddenly 
lost our statuses. I haven’t told all my 
friends yet — it’s something I’m try-
ing to find the right time to do.”

According to Connie Choi, an 
immigration rights lawyer for APLC, 
the 2000 U.S. census found that there 
were 2.5 million undocumented stu-
dents under 18 living in the coun-
try — of these, 40 percent lived in 

California, and 21 percent were Asian 
or Pacific Islander. 

According to documents released 
by the university in 2010, there 
were 572 potentially undocumented 
undergraduate AB 540 students with-
in the UC system as of 2008. Of these, 
263 were Latino, 263 were Asian, 3 
were black, 23 were white and 20 
were from an unknown ethnic back-
ground. In total, under AB 540, these 
students paid  $26.9 million less than 
they would have with out-of-state 
tuition. Of these, 81 are potentially 
undocumented undergraduate stu-
dents at UCSD.

“A lot of people have stereotypes,” 
Michelle said. “[People say] illegal 
immigrants [are] from across the 
border, [that] ‘they’re Mexicans’ — 

that’s just not true. The D.R.E.A.M. 
Act is something that will affect a lot 
of people, regardless of background.”

UC Office of the President 
spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka said the 
university supports the passage of the 
D.R.E.A.M. act, though it is too early 
to speculate on when — or if — the 
legislation will pass.

Steve*, a Warren College junior 
who wished to remain anonymous, 
said that although undocumented 
immigrants currently make up less 
than three-tenths of the UC student 
population, their status prevents 
them from receiving state financial 
aid and therefore makes it more dif-
ficult for them to attend college. As

Tempers flared last night as councilmembers, with only two meetings left in term, dis-
cussed impeachments and student-org 
funding — again.

The meeting began with a presen-
tation by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue, who stressed that 
one role of the council is to improve 
campus climate, and announced that 
the 2010 graduation speaker will be 
Laren Poole, a 
Marshall College 
alumnus. Poole is 
a co-founder of 
Invisible Children, 
a group dedicated 
to protecting chil-
dren in Africa.

Triton Television Station Manager 
Thomas Dadourian announced that 
the station was planning to pair up 
with individual college stations to 
share knowledge and ensure that the 
smaller stations didn’t “die out every 
four years.” 

Advocate General Parminder 
Sandhu presented awards to council-
members who had good attendance 
records or had improved over the past 
quarter. Recipients included Transfer 
Senator Adam Powers, President 
Utsav Gupta and Campuswide 
Senator Tobias Haglund. Haglund 
was not present to receive his award. 

Vice President of Student Life 
Ricsie Hernandez announced that the 
Sun God Festival store is now open on 
the second floor of Price Center, near 
the old post office.

A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben 
Hassine announced that she was 
working with the Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality committee on a 
project that would allow students to 
exchange dining dollars with other 
students. 

“Mark Cunningham supports it 
full on, even though they don’t make 

a profit,” Ben Hassine said. “I almost 
feel like there’s something shady going 
on.”

During campus affair committee 
presentations, the council passed an 
amendment that requires the outgoing 
VP of Student Life to appoint mem-
bers to the next year’s campuswide 
committees by Week Eight, instead of 
only “when requested to do so.”

The council then turned to the 
question of wheth-
er to impeach 
oft-absent vot-
ing members. 
Campuswide 
Senator Bryant 
Pena argued that 
very few people 

eligible for impeachment during 
Winter Quarter had been impeached. 

“We impeached two people 
though there were 11 eligible,” he said. 
“One had like 13 absences and the 
other, well, I don’t even remember 
what they look like.” 

All impeachments were failed.
Afterward, councilmembers debat-

ed whether they should fully fund an 
event put on by Students for Justice 
for Palestine on April 20. A.S. Council 
policy determines that it funds only 
half of all contracts, but, due to a mis-
understanding, SJP put on the event 
expecting to be fully reimbursed. 

The council was concerned about 
being inconsistent, but Campuswide 
Senator Adam Kenworthy disregard-
ed these claims. 

“This council has never been con-
sistent,” Kenworthy said. “If consisten-
cy was a batting average, we would be 
traded.” The council reimbursed SJP.

The meeting ended with Sandhu 
again bringing up impeachments. 

“I’m like the guy in Green Eggs 
and Ham,” he said. “I will talk about 
impeachments with you on a boat, on 
a house, outside a house, on the sea.”

You may not be able to afford an 
iPad just yet, but you might want to 
start saving up for the next version, 
because researchers are develop-
ing technology that will transmit 
viral videos like those on YouTube 
at higher speeds and qualities than 
ever before.

Combining silicon chip technol-
ogy with the latest wireless com-
munication tools, researchers at the 
Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits 
group are testing the limits of the 
amount of data that can be transmit-
ted wirelessly — at a speed faster 
than your laptop’s current network 
connection.

“We’re all sort of pushing to help 
deliver next generation wireless 
services to smartphones, notebooks, 
iPads and more,” electrical-engi-
neering professor Lawrence Larson 
said.

Larson has been teaming up with 
fellow electrical-engineering profes-
sors Peter Asbeck, James Buckwalter 
and Gabriel Rebeiz for the past 
decade to study the evolving tech-
nology of wireless data transfer. 

“We’ve been working on it for 
10 years, and will be working on it 
for the next 100, I’m sure,” Larson 
said. “Communications is kind of 
an insatiable human need, and that’s 
not going to be satisfied any time 
soon.”

The work of Larson and his 
colleagues is primarily focused on 
video transmission, which requires 

sending significantly more data 
through the air than sound or text 
alone.

“In order to transmit video to a 
wireless device, you have to be able 
to transmit lots and lots and lots 
of bits very, very quickly over the 
air,” Larson said. “It’s kind of like 
a greater order of magnitude than 
any other application — more than 
e-mail, more than voice. Video is a 
dramatic increase. What we have to 
do is go to higher frequencies in the 
electromagnetic spectrum.”

While television signals travel 
at about 500 MHz and cell phone 
signals travel at about 2,000 MHz, 
Larson and his team are developing 
chips that can handle signals rang-
ing from 20,000 to 60,000 MHz.

“It’s really because video has this 
amazing requirement of data rate 
bits per second, we have to go [to] 
these higher frequencies,” Larson 
said. 

Larson said the main challenge 
his team faces in their research is 
developing hardware capable of 
operating at such high frequencies 
while still maintaining the precision 
and accuracy necessary to produce a 
quality video or transmission.

In order to test the different chip 
prototypes, researchers monitor the 
quality and speed of each transmis-
sion.

“We have test equipment that 
generates the exact type of signals 
that might be received wirelessly 
or the types of signals you might 
want to transmit wirelessly,” Larson 
said. “Then we measure our devices 
and see how well they do against 
the specifications that are needed 
in order to work well. It’s the same 
kind of test equipment that people 
in industry use to test high-speed 
wireless equipment.”

Larson said that, eventually, 

all consumer products will feature 
wireless communication capabilities.

“The number of devices [that can 
communicate wirelessly] is really 
kind of limited,” he said. 

“In the future, I think that the 
theory is that almost every manu-
factured object on the planet will 
have the ability to communicate 
wirelessly — so books, and packaged 
food and clothing and appliances 
and everything on earth that is man-
ufactured will be able to wirelessly 
connect to the Internet.”

Larson said the continued 
development of wireless technol-
ogy — specifically, by firms located 
in California — will allow the state 
to maintain a technological edge 
in the U.S. “We really feel that this 
kind of work is part of the creativity 
that will spawn new jobs and new 
startup companies, and new oppor-
tunities for wireless devices,” Larson 
said. “Hopefully one of the big 
implications of our research is that 
this will help California maintain its 
high-tech lead in the wireless indus-
try on a worldwide basis.”

Gupta has gone and hired an athlet-
ics consultant to measure the feasibil-
ity of his monumental pet project. 
The student council is chipping in 
$7,000 for university athletics expert 
Carl McAloose to evaluate the cost of 
a brand-new football program along 
with what it would take to move 
existing UCSD teams to Division-I. 

Despite the fact that A.S. 
President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine 
has made it clear she plans to trash 
Gupta’s dream faster than we can say 
“student fees,” the hiring of McAloose 
is not entirely in vain. Not only 
did the money come from the A.S. 
Enterprise income (not direct activ-
ity fees) but Gupta persuaded the 
administration to cover the remain-
ing $21,000 of the $28,000 cost — no 
small feat in the age of the bleeding 

budget. At town halls and public 
meetings held this year on the pros-
pect of a football team, its estimated 
cost has fluctuated from $1 million to 
$16 million. A professional study of 
what it would take to make it happen 
is valuable knowledge for everyone 
involved in the debate. If it’s far too 
expensive, it will hopefully put the 
pigskin to rest, or if it turns out more 
feasible than we thought, a future 
council could continue to negotiate a 
deal with the university.

Though we predict that the final 
estimate won’t be worth all UCLA’s 
school spirit and Berkeley’s prestige 
combined, we’re much more hope-
ful that McAloose’s study will bring 
us one step closer to a D-I athletics 
upgrade (which Ben Hassine is much 
more ready to support). 

Understandably, many university 
athletes don’t want to make the move 
— it would be a bummer to go from 

being the No. 1 D-II school in the 
nation to being at the bottom of the 
top. Should UCSD make the upgrade, 
Triton athletes would have to wait as 
long as four years before being able 
to compete at nationals. But as our 
teams hit their D-II peak and the 
upgrade option opens up next fall, it’s 
time to think long-term. 

Football isn’t the sole reason we’re 
only third best in the UC popular-
ity contest; our D-II status is just as 
much a reason we’ve always lagged 
in reputation behind Berkeley and 
UCLA. An upgrade would place 
us in the same league as our sister 
schools and pit us against top-caliber 
teams across the country — garner-
ing more publicity from spectators, 
current students and prospective 
students alike. We’d also be able to 
offer athletic scholarships; suddenly 
a 70-degree year-round climate 
wouldn’t be the only perk we could 

offer high-school recruits uninterest-
ed in attending a nerdy science-only 
institution. 

Most importantly, the prestige 
and student investment that would 
come from a D-I ranking could 
bring in some sizeable donations for 
the Alumni Association for some-
thing other than cancer research. 
And hey, if a the D-I move works 
out, maybe a few years down the 
line, we can talk football. Until then, 
baby steps.

In a time when almost every business this side of Wal-Mart is posting profit losses, it’s especially hard to be the lit-
tle guy with a niche market. And if anyone 
knows about failing businesses, it’s us.

UCSD’s student-run co-operatives 
— whose $3 wraps and $2 DVD rentals 
provide an invaluable alternative to the 
Price Center mall — have proven to be no 
exception. From 2005 to 2008 — during 
an intense period of construction at the 
old Student Center — the Food Co-op, 
the General Store Co-op and Groundwork 
Books all suffered financially from 
decreased foot traffic. Since then, not one 
has been able to rebound in full force.

Tomorrow, co-op representatives will 
meet again with Director of University 
Centers Paul Terzino to negotiate lower 
rent — and, because they’re paying as 
much as $1,700 per month while provid-
ing valuable student resources, the break 

would be well-deserved. 
Terzino has made it 

clear that University Centers — which 
also collects rent from commercial 
establishments paying far higher rates for 
prime Price Center real estate — could 
not to afford to eliminate the co-ops’ 
rent altogether (as many members have 
expressed is their ideal). But Terzino did 
say he would be willing to settle on lower 
rates, or even establish a pay-as-you-can 
rent system that would allow the co-ops 
greater flexibility in making ends meet.

We’re hesitant to buy into Terzino’s 
claim that University Centers — which 
also collects a $76.50 quarterly fee from 
every student — couldn’t support itself 
without the co-ops’ estimated $2,845 
monthly contribution. But as strongly as 
we support the co-ops, we also believe 
they should be held more accountable in 
case they’re granted lower rent. 

Unless you’re a Student Center group-
ie, chances are you haven’t set foot in a 
co-op since you were required to buy an 
obscure Marxist textbook a few quarters 
back. And there’s no denying they cater 
to a minority niche of hip humanities 
professors and cigarette fiends. As a result, 
there are few efforts outside the Student 

Center to advertise the co-ops’ many 
strong selling points — which more 

than justify a detour from Library 
Walk.

You’re Looking  
Pretty Cool 
in That AIDS 
T-Shirt
When I heard they’d built a brand new Urban Outfitters in Pacific 
Beach, all that’s trendy in me couldn’t 
help but swing by for a brief tour. 

Being a self-loathing hipster of 
sorts, I’ll admit I hate myself for get-
ting juiced about $30 hair clips and 
shorts that give me camel toe. My 
theory is that I’m drawn to the faux-
alternative chain because I’ve been 
hypnotized by genius psychological 
marketing strategies for so long that 
there’s no more hope of resisting the 
establishment’s indie-chic pull.

So I dropped by for a visit. And, 
as I was standing behind some spray-
tanned PB rats in line for a fitting 
room — tapping my foot to the whiny 
sleeve-pop (yeah, bet you haven’t 
heard of that one) on the store’s omni-
present soundtrack — my eyes wan-
dered to a mannequin in a black shirt.

At first glance the shirt seemed 
typical Urban: slim-fitting, covered 
in colorful images reminiscent of a 
cooler decade and overpriced as hell. 
But a closer look revealed the graphic 
to be three grinning black kids hover-
ing above funky block-letter text that 
read “HAITI.” 

My first reaction was to get pissed 
at whatever corporate slime decided 
it was chill to squeeze profit from 
the decade’s most devastating natural 
disaster. However, easily distracted 
by something covered in sequins on 
the fitting-room return rack, I soon 
forgot about it entirely. 

But once I’d officially evacuated 
the store — $100 poorer and high on 
consumerist thrill — I decided to do 
some sleuthing on the subject.

Turns out clothing company 
OBEY partnered with Awareness 
and Artists For Peace and Justice to 
develop the trendy Haiti attire as a 
way to raise money for the country in 
turmoil. Apparently, when somebody 
buys one of the shirts, all profits go 
directly to the cause. Hipster gets his 
outfit, Haiti gets its money. Everybody 
wins, right?.

Still, the idea that some trend-
mongering kid would buy the T-shirt  
— probably because it matched his 
skinny jeans and made him look 
compassionate and informed at some 
Owl City concert — sort of makes me 
hate humanity.

More and more, companies look-
ing to capitalize on a charity cam-
paign are making a big fashionable 
spectacle out of it. Bono may have 
intended to heal the world when he 
started his Product Red campaign 
in 2006 — sprinkling iPods and 
Starbucks cups with a sharp red 
label to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria — but he also developed a 
way for corporations to profit from 
bourgie rich folks who want to look 
like they’re giving back.

The Haiti shirt campaign is no dif-
ferent. No matter how much money 
is donated to the suffering country, it 
doesn’t change the fact that half the 
people who contributed to the cause 
didn’t give a shit about it. I guess it’s 
better than the profits going straight 
to another trust fund — but it’s still 
pretty embarrassing that our coun-
try’s current most popular form of 
philanthropy hinges on the American 
consumer’s bad sense of taste.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

Dear Editor, 

I love co-operatives. They can be 
extremely successful. I belong to REI, 
which is a co-op, as well as Canada’s 
Mountain Equipment Co-op, which 
I think is the best thing since sliced 
bread. The co-op model is one of the 
most underappreciated and ignored 
business models in America — some 
of the most well-informed people I’ve 
encountered don’t understand how 
co-ops work.

Contrary to popular opinion, a 
co-op is not a commune or a collec-
tive. It is not ideologically socialist, 
communist or capitalist. It is a formal 
organization with owners like any 
other corporation. The difference 
with a co-op, though, is that the orga-
nization’s owners are the consumers, 
rather than investors. A co-op exists 
to serve the people that use it, rather 
than make money for the people that 
own it. It is rather like a union, but 
for consumers — those that use the 
space get to say how it runs.

With this understood, though, it 
doesn’t seem to be the case that the 
General Store or the Food Co-op are, 
in fact, co-ops. It is unclear why the 
default assumption is that the indi-
viduals currently there are those who 

should be there.
So, a proposal: Given that the 

university student population is con-
stantly changing, the A.S. Council 
and Graduate Student Association 
should consider deciding yearly 
to whom it should give the space, 
based on an application process that 
preserves the spirit and intent of 
the co-ops while recognizing that 
no particular set of students have 
a right, by heritage, to manage the 
space. Alternatively, it could mandate 
a genuinely co-op-style governance 
structure, in which users of the co-op 
vote on a board of directors who are 
then responsible for choosing who 
manages the space.

Otherwise, it’s just a club with 
cash registers and a guaranteed 
space.

Campus Co-op Model 
Needs Reevaluating

The Food Co-op, for its part, sells 
affordable vegan and vegetarian grub 
without the side of MSG from chains 
like Panda Express. Groundwork 
Books offers $1 book sales on used 
reads from fairly popular authors. The 
Che Cafe hosts shows regularly for 
under $10. The General Store is the 
only place on campus to buy cigarettes. 

Making greater efforts to publicize 
events put on by the co-ops wouldn’t 
hurt either. The occasional fiction 
and poetry readings might not draw a 
Loft-sized crowd to the muraled doors 
of the food co-op, but it wouldn’t hurt 
to advertise — especially if you con-
sider yourself an all-student service. 
It could even be as simple as hiring a 
student artist to create promotional 

signs to hang around campus.
Due to a lack of consistent promo-

tion, most students aren’t even aware 
of the cheap curry and American 
Spirits that the co-ops have to offer — 
and it’s no wonder a small customer 
base of close friends can’t provide 
enough profit to make rent.

Despite the fact that longtime 
co-op members such as General Store 
core member Andrew Rubens insist 
that student-run co-operatives are 
not businesses — but rather student 
organizations providing products in 
exchange for money — the co-ops 
still have to assume some level of fis-
cal responsibility — which includes 
recruiting a solid customer base and 
keeping profit records. Business or not, 
it’s the purpose of any buy-and-sell 

system to at least break even.
Because the co-ops have yet to 

present Terzino with any sort of 
records, it isn’t apparent exactly how 
large a break they’d need to stay in 
the clear. Still, we’re inclined to say 
rent should be halved — in exchange, 
of course, for a simple list of buys, 
sells and promotional efforts. After 
all, the co-ops’ operation relies on 
finances, so some form of rent should 
be maintained at least as a symbol of 
exchange.

 Of course, instituting these kinds 
of changes may require more orga-
nization or helping hands, but if that 
means pulling the co-ops out of the 
red — and teaching students how to 
run a more sustainable operation — 
then it’s more than worth the effort.

“They are used for statistical pur-
poses only, and in room selection, to 
keep with the theme of International 
House as half U.S. and half interna-
tional students,” Gilhoi said.  “For 
example, in a four-person apartment, 
there would be two U.S. students and 
two international students.”

Tatjana Lischetzki — who went by 
the name of Elizabeth* in a previ-
ous Guardian article and was denied 
acceptance to I-House last year — met 
with Gilhoi and ERC Resident Dean 
Rey Guerrero on April 16 to discuss 
the content of the leaked e-mail.  

“They used this example that if 
there are already too many people 
from the UK, and even if a bunch of 
UK students got higher scores than 
someone from France or Italy, they 
will pick from the applicants from 
France or Italy,” Lischetzki said. “So 
even if other people might have higher 
scores, they can still not get in, because 
there are too many applicants already 
accepted from that area.”

John*, an anonymous student who 
used the e-mail address concerneduc-
sd@yahoo.com to criticize the admis-
sions system on the I-House listserv, 
sent Houston an e-mail on April 9 
detailing his concerns.  

He received an e-mail response 
from Houston on April 10 acknowl-
edging his concern and notifying him 
of the investigation.  

John said that I-House’s practice 
of accepting 50 percent U.S. students 
and 50 percent international students 
should be an illegal quota system. 

“There is just no way that the 
50-percent quota for international stu-
dents is constitutional,” John said.   

He referred to the 1978 Supreme 
Court decision in Regents of the 
University of California v. Bakke, which 
allowed race to be a consideration in 
admissions policy — in the interest 
of academic diversity — but held that 
quotas were illegal. 

Additionally, Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimi-
nation on the basis of race, color or 
national origin for all programs receiv-
ing financial assistance from the fed-
eral government. 

Lischetzki added that she is skepti-
cal as to why I-House officials are not 

providing the details of their recent 
investigation.

“It speaks to the fact that there is 
something that they might not want us 
to know,” Litschetzki said.  “They think 
its better to not show anything.”

According to Gilhoi, I-House 
reviews applications in two rounds. 
The first round takes place in February, 
and is only open to current UCSD stu-
dents. The second round, which takes 
place in June, is open to international 
students, new transfer students and 
new graduate students. 

All applications are initially 
reviewed by a selection commit-
tee of 24 current I-House students, 
including both U.S. and international 
students.  This committee — which 
Gilhoi said reviews applications “inde-
pendently and without discussion” — 
scores the applicants based strictly on 
essay responses, a creative submission 
and letters of recommendation.

This score sheet is sent to a com-
mittee of staff members from both 
I-House and ERC Resident Life. The 
committee considers the preliminary 
rankings — along with “additional cri-
teria” such as housing guarantee status, 
student conduct and gender balance — 
to choose the initial round of admits.

“We analyze how the applicant 
would play a role in promoting cross-
cultural communication and the 
exchange of global ideas and opinions 
in the community.,” Gilhoi said. “The 
committee members evaluate the rea-
son for the applicant’s interest in liv-
ing in I-House, the activities they are 
interested in being involved with and 
how their past experiences and inter-
ests would contribute to the I-House 
community.” 

Nevertheless, John — along with 
several other students who registered 
complaints after the March 4 e-mail — 
said he is doubtful that past experienc-
es and additional criteria are the only 
reasons some applicants were rejected. 

“Obviously they claim to not use 
race, but I think they have already 
acknowledged racial discrimination,” 
John said.

The UCSD Legal Counsel could 
not be reached for comment.

To ﬁnd out how, just go to:  

an undocumented immigrant who 
moved to the U.S. from Argentina 
at age 10, Steve said he considers 
California his home, and should not 
be penalized because of circumstanc-
es over which he had no control.

“I definitely think of California 
as home,” he said. “I know Argentina 
is a big part of my life, but my time 
for development and education was 
in California. It is my life; it is my 
home.”

Steve said that UCSD’s proximity 
to the Mexican border is frequently 
a source of stress for 
undocumented students 
on campus, because they 
could easily be deported.

“It’s especially diffi-
cult for San Diego stu-
dents because we are 
so close to the border, 
and we are in danger of 
being deported at any 
time,” he said. “We want 
to make sure that fear is 
taken away for students 
who just want to go to 
classes to better them-
selves.”

Steve said he is work-
ing to pressure state leg-
islators to take action on 
the bill, because he feels that receiv-
ing residency status is crucial to any-
one hoping to seek employment in 
the U.S. following graduation.

“We have students who may not 
be able to work in their field,” he said. 
“Even though we are working so hard 
for this degree, we may not be able to 
practice.”

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West is currently 
lobbying for the D.R.E.A.M. Act in 
conjunction with the United States 
Student Association and other UC 
campuses.

“Education is a right for all stu-
dents, and everyone should have 
access to financial aid… not based on 
citizenship,” West said.

She said she has plans to lobby 
political candidates who don’t support 
the act, such as Republican guberna-
torial candidates Meg Whitman and 
Steve Poizner. Both have declared 
undocumented students to be a 

financial burden on the UC system, 
and said they will not support the act.

“[The office of] External Affairs 
will lobby the legislators who do 
oppose the D.R.E.A.M act,” West 
said. “I know Meg Whitman is run-
ning — we’ll try to convince her 
that prioritizing students’ access and 
affordability is an issue. We’re going 
to make sure that we’re being heard.”

The offices of Meg Whitman and 
Steve Poizner could not be reached 
for comment.

In addition, West said, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger has been an 

obstacle to the bill’s passage 
through the state Senate. 
Schwarzenegger has stated 
in the past that it is not fis-
cally responsible to provide 
tuition relief to undocu-
mented students. 

“It’s been consistently 
voted down by the gov-
ernor of California,” West 
said. “He’s the only one 
preventing the California 
D.R.E.A.M Act from pass-
ing.”

Francisco Castillo, 
Schwarzenegger’s press 
secretary, said the governor 
supported the AB 540 bill 
that allowed undocument-

ed students to pay in-state tuition, 
but not the D.R.E.A.M. Act, which he 
vetoed in both 2005 and 2008.

At the time of the veto, 
Schwarzenegger said it would be irre-
sponsible to offer further aid to undoc-
umented students when the university 
is already raising student fees just to 
maintain the quality of education.

Castillo added that, should the act 
be passed, fewer funds would have to 
be distributed among a larger pool 
of applicants, which Schwarzenegger 
sees as penalizing legal students who 
require assistance.

“[Schwarzenegger] believes [illegal 
immigrants] should not be penalized 
for the acts of their parents, but the act 
would penalize students who are here 
legally by reducing the financial aid 
available to them,” Castillo said. 

The UC Board of Regents meet-
ing last month — held at UC San 
Francisco from March 23 to March 
25 — was also the site of protests by 

affirmative-action supporters By Any 
Means Necessary. They convened 
to pressure the board to adopt a 
D.R.E.A.M. scholarship program for 
immigrant students.

Yvette Felarca, the Northern 
California coordinator for BAMN, 
said she was disappointed with the 
lack of D.R.E.A.M. discussion at the 
meeting. She said there were approxi-
mately 50 students present on March 
24, coming from nearly all the UC 
campuses. 

“The main discussion about the 
D.R.E.A.M. scholarship happened on 
Tuesday, and it was very disturbing 
what they didn’t say,” Felarca said. 
“The regents made it loud and clear 
that they are not interested in abol-
ishing the segregation of UC cam-
puses — a segregation that leads to a 
hostile climate and means that there 
is no true public higher education.” 

Vice President of External Affairs-
elect Michael Lam said that although 
he could not comment on the 
D.R.E.A.M. Act at this time, he plans 
to meet with West before determin-
ing what actions he should take upon 
entering office.

Various versions of the bill have 
been proposed since 2001. In 2005, 
Senator Gilbert Cedillo (D-Los 
Angeles) proposed a similar bill 
called SB 60, which Schwarzenegger 
vetoed. He then authored a different 
version, SB 1301, which was intro-
duced in February 2008. It passed 
through state Assembly and Senate, 
where it passed 46 to 29; however, it 
was then vetoed by Schwarzenegger 
on Sept. 30. The newest version, SB 
1460, was introduced Feb. 19 of this 
year, and is currently being discussed 
in a Senate committee. 

If passed, eligible students must 
fulfill the requirements of the AB 
540 bill. Students must be currently 
enrolled at an accredited institution 
of higher education in California and 
must file an affidavit stating that they 
will apply for legal residency as soon 
as possible.

Anyone eager to soak up some sun and local perspective this 
weekend should stop by the annual Mission Federal Art Walk in 
Little Italy — San Diego’s largest urban art festival. The ritzy little 
hood is transformed into an outdoor gallery for hundreds of local 
and national artists show off their work. While the vendors aren’t 
likely to accept your overﬂow meal points, the festival is a perfect 
(and free) opportunity to check out some intellectual eye candy — 
and perhaps grab some funnel cake on your way out. (AS)

Good news: The last time Chuck Potashner’s teamAWESOME! 
played the Che, the group wore tails and animal-head hoodies 
while banging out dance-pop numbers on hide-and-seek and 
pirate ships. In rebellion to the MGMT electric-playground trend, 
their show will be acoustic, backed by UCSD students Christina 
Tsui (aka bedroom guitarist A Book About Elephants) and Anton 
Haugen on piano. We get to loop back around to kindergarten 
after graduation, right? (MP)

ACOUSTIC NIGHT AT THE CHE 
CHE CAFE / APRIL 27, 8 P.M. / $5

By Neda Salamat
Senior Staff Writer

Every year, Indio, Calif., sees a massive 
spike in population. Tens of thousands 
of concert enthusiasts flood the city for 
the West Coast’s biggest, baddest musical 
attraction: the one-and-only Coachella. 

I’ve always managed to dodge 
Coachella due to lack of funds, but this 
year, a friend of mine found a loophole for 
all those on a holy-shit-it’s-$300 budget: 
the volunteer option. In exchange for 18 
hours of slavery, volunteers receive free 
festival entry and complimentary camping. 
Considering most acts didn’t start their 
sets until 12 p.m. (and the rave didn’t start 
until 4 p.m.), it was a pretty sweet deal.

Due to a two-hour delay at volunteer 
check-in, we were fortunate: no Friday 
shift. If fortunate means having to show up 
(sober, ideally) at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday.

When 6:30 a.m. rolled around, we 
each took cold showers and brushed our 
teeth from water bottles — all except one 
friend. who accidentally grabbed a vodka 
bottle, a la Ke$ha. This was confirmed 
by a very un-Ke$ha “What the fuck!” At 
check-in, we were informed that we were 
on trash duty. Karma, apparently, for all 
those bottles I tossed and trampled during 
Passion Pit’s show the night before.

Fortunately, the job was mostly 
monotonous and straightforward. (By 
the way, if you went to Coachella and are 
missing a pair of underwear, we found it 
— along with 10 others.)

I was beginning to resemble Oscar the 
Grouch by the time our supervisors relo-
cated us. We were whisked down a dusty 
road in a golf cart, kicked out and made to 
hold up “Venue is this way” signs. Suck on 
this, Vanna White.

One hour before freedom, a guy ran 
up to us in panic. He’d left his sunscreen 
bottle on the bus and wanted it back. 
We informed him that we couldn’t get it, 
but offered ours instead. Turns out “sun-
screen” was code for “well-disguised alco-
hol” that he was trying to sneak in. For 
the next hour, we watched in amusement 
as he boarded every bus and searched 
beneath the seats. I can only hope the sce-
nario ended in some whitey trying to pre-
vent skin cancer with a handful of Patron.

On Sunday, we were told we’d be on 
ticketing duty. I was charged with the 
task of snapping wristbands onto ticket-
holders after they were scanned by Aaron 
— the Batman to my Robin.

Just when the shift was starting to put 
me to sleep, there was a deafening clang 
and thud as one wayward rebel tried to 
jump the fence behind Aaron, and instead 
ate a face full of dust. Not to be deterred, 
he peeled himself up and made for the 
gates amid cries of “Security!” Admirably, 
he actually made it in for a second — 
before being tackled and thrown back into 
the dirt. (This time, on the outside.)

More cautious schemers got creative to 
swindle their way into the festival. One girl 
came up, bawling that her ticket had been 
stolen when she’d been drugged and drunk 
— only to change her story when she 
spoke to someone else. One pair arrived 
dressed as a Chinese dragon, announcing 
that they were the Coachella dragon and 
needed to be let in. After being denied 
entry — looking as scandalized as a plastic 
dragon mask can look — the costume was 
found abandoned next to a pile of trash. 

Of course, there were perks to offset 
the craziness — volunteers were gifted all 
confiscated items, including beer. We were 
fed sandwiches, and the staff was pretty 
lenient: I even had the chance to sneak off 
to see MUTEMATH during one of my 
shifts. Not so bad, considering everyone 
else who got in free was escorted out by 
police, sporting a host of battle wounds.

Working 
Hard for 
the Music

I t’s a gutsy move to direct a play centered on some of the same racial issues 
that rocked the campus last 
quarter — but freshman 
Master of Fine Arts stu-
dent Larissa Lury just went 
there. Based on a script by 
junior playwright Ronald 
McCants, “Oyster” follows 
a black man’s struggle to 
reconnect with the son he 
abandoned long ago. Like 
so, Lury examines the black 
experience in America 
through the lens of one 
father-son relationship. 

Commenting on every-
thing from poverty and 
personal loss to the military, 
child abandonment, aca-
demic elitism, racism, affir-
mative action and fraternity 
hazing, it would seem that 
McCants bit off more than 
he could chew. But with two 
of the most talented actors 
in the MFA program to 
carry the script, nearly every 
piece of its ambitious puzzle 
falls effortlessly into place.

At the outset, we meet

Muirstock 2010 takes your deleted account centerstage.  By Matthew Pecot

It’s been years since you moved on to Facebook, but Sherwood’s still playing puppy-love pop like 
you never got rid of your MySpace.

Considering the band’s third 
album, QU, is dominated by lead 
singer Nate Henry’s sickly croon, it’s 
surprisingly mellow — only causing 
truly unbearable nausea when he 
prods at the choruses. The biggest 

perk is that lyrics like “Now I’ve 
been making eyes at you all night/ 
Trying to decide what’s on your 
mind” might ease your transition 
from high school to Tioga Hall.

Hailing from San Luis Obispo, 
the band’s niche lies between mid-
Cal chill and Freudian repression. 
The Sherwood signature consists of 
plinky soft-rock verses with zero-

distortion guitars, strumming so 
unobtrusively that it’s a shock when 
tracks like “You Are” break out a 
choppy rhythm reminiscent of the 
Jonas Brothers. 

Sherwood does occasionally 
amp it up for a stadium singalong 
— get ready to put your hands in 
the air — but they’re mainly mas-
ters of the awkward sway.SHERWOOD

G ive Vampire Weekend a beach and a beer, and you’ve got this LA college-rock happy place. 
Every chorus is harmonized, and every 
guitar’s reverb cranked to 11 — and 
though the California chill smooths out 
the best of the VW bounce, the Smiles 
are still the most danceable dudes here. 
Forget you’re stuck on campus and 
slow-spin to a sunny bass.THE SMILES HE IS WE

T hey might do pretty indie a la She & Him, but unsigned He Is We is more hi-fi studio 
production than pillow talk.

More than a little multi-tracking 
of singer Rachel Taylor’s soft and 
soaring vocals pluck He Is We far 
out of the bedroom genre. You’d 
think instrumentalist Trevor Kelly 
was being charged for every note, 
considering the way he hardly 
touches his acoustic six-string and 
piano during a verse — then splurg-
es on a soft-strummed chorus. 

However treated, Taylor’s voice 
takes the lead, hopscotching the 
octave to pump the duo’s broken-
hearted lullabies with some star 
power. Listen for standout head-
bobber “A Mess It Grows.” It’ll be 
a welcome romp on the swing set 
after a traumatic round of midterms.

THE
RICHARD
TATER
FUNKESTRA

F atally hip student band Funkestra may or may not be happy to see you, 
but somehow they’ve hidden an 
entire horn section in their pants 
— and they’re not afraid to whip 
it out every Thursday at Porter’s 
Pub. This goofball outfit plays 
call-and-response numbers with 
stanky vocals, but their specialty 

is losing themselves in freak-
out jazz jams. In fact, the only 
thing that keeps the funksters 
grounded is cymbal-happy drum 
god Burleigh Drummond — but 
still, only Michael J. Fox and your 
weird aunt could dance naturally 
to these polyrhythms, so show up 
adequately addled to float with 
one seriously lethal form of funk.

Lou Rhodes
One Good Thing
MOTION AUDIO

F ormer lead singer of Manchester-based drum ‘n’ bass band 
Lamb, Lou Rhodes has a 
set of British pipes that’s 
both nuanced and easy 
on the ears — but it’s 
not nearly enough to set 
her apart from the Kate 
Nashes of the world.

After gathering a 
small following with 
emotionally charged ’90s 
hit “The Rain” — not 
to mention a spot on 
the hit “Moulin Rouge” 
soundtrack — her third 
album falls flat, starved 
of Lamb’s lush sonic tex-
tures and blasting further 
into blandville with every 
(slightly tweaked) take 

on moody acoustics.
Rhodes’ whisper does 

burst with sincerity on 
the titular track, but her 
emotion is unrealistically 
directed at a vague end-
of-the-world scenario, 
rendered even more 
underwhelming by a 
stock-chord backdrop.

Rhodes bleeds emo 
tree-sap tears on album 
highlight “Bloom,” relay-
ing her desire to bloom 
with flowers that lift their 
heads toward the sun. 
It begins as the most 
understated stuff on the 
album — five strings 
are plucked on loop — 
but a more intriguing 
parade of players slowly 

enters the room: A tin-
kling arpeggio drops at 
random intervals while 
swelling strings and sing-
ers combine for dramatic 
crescendo. All the while, 
Rhodes remains plain 
and sweet, refusing to 
either drown out or fall 
in line with her under-
layers. The complex 
harmony showcases her 
goods more than any 
sparse acoustic tune: 
Rhodes’ voice may be 
forgettable on its own, 
but give it a busy enough 
backdrop and its pure 
simplicity begins to shine 
through.

ALBUMREVIEWS

Coheed & Cambria
Year of the Black Rainbow
COLUMBIA

I f you were at the 2008 Sun God Festival, you may remember those 
guys with the crazy hair 
who destroyed the main 
stage after Sean Kingston 
spent an hour waddling 
around like an obese 
apocalypse. Coheed and 
Cambria were electric 
then, and have only gotten 
better — as demonstrated 
on new LP Year of the 
Black Rainbow.

Longtime fans know 
that each of their albums 
is part of a conceptual 
story masterminded by 
lead singer and guitarist 
Claudio Sanchez; Rainbow 
serves as the prequel. 
While stepping back in the 
storyline, the album takes 
a step outside the band’s 
former talent bracket — 
while never losing touch 
with its roots. 

They’re able to deliver 
their emotive power with 
more elegance than ever 
before, taking all the 
awkwardness out of their 
signature genre jumps. 
On lead single “Here 
We Are Juggernaut,” the 
band delves for the first 
time into industrial prog-
rock, clanking drums like 
pistons and overlaying 
ground guitars with all 
the grimy charm of 1800s 
London. And just when 
Sanchez’ bombastic pro-

duction is about to get 
overwhelming, drummer 
Chris Pennie always takes 
the beat back to basic.

Most of the time, 
though, Sanchez’s grand-
stand is appropriate and 
powerful: “This Shattered 
Symphony” is the album’s 
pinnacle, evolving the 
post-hardcore origins of 
the band into a modern 
experiment. Sanchez 
throws down a punchy 
guitar riff to accompany 
an orchestral lead, equally 
wishy-washy on the mic 
between a high-pitched 
croon and vicious growl. 

Halfway through its 
vigorous run, however, 
Rainbow does begin to feel 
ponderous and overdone; 
some tracks are virtual 
photocopies of the first six. 
The latter-half exception 
is the softhearted “Pearl of 
the Stars,” on which indus-
trial drums grind gently 
behind a delicate guitar 
line as Sanchez reflects on 
a girl he calls his “angel 
from the west, the pearl of 
the stars.” 

Powerful, ambitious 
and melodramatic as ever, 
Coheed and Cambria 
won’t win any new fans 
with Rainbow — but it’ll 
impress the hell out of the 
diehards.

Kate Nash
My Best Friend Is You
FICTION

W hile she never aban-dons her trademark folk-rock sensibili-
ties from debut Made of 
Bricks, Kate Nash whips 
out a brand-new cache 
psychedelic embellish-
ments for sophomore 
effort My Best Friend Is 
You — venturing onto 
refreshingly adult frontiers 
without compromising her 
melodic kiddie-pop core.

Nash’s Cockney accent 
is a daring shell for her 
trained octaves, alternat-
ing between sweet, sassy 
and snarling amid the 
most impressive range her 
side of the Atlantic. The 
further she strides from 
the safe, label-padded 
Bricks, the foxier the riot-
ous modern-Motown 
sound.

Nash has mastered tra-
ditional 1960s pop with a 
punch and a wink: “Doo-
Wah-Doo” overlays 12-bar 
Buddy Holly blues instru-
mentation with a verbal 
catfight, doing what the 
Beach Boys could never 
do by ending on the line, 
“She’s a bitch!” 

But the album’s rar-
est gems are a handful 
of slithering, sub-punk 
numbers on which Nash 
transforms from podunk 
beauty queen to snarling, 
irreverent rock star in the 
big city. “Mansion Song” 

is the best of her party in 
the UK, driven by power-
ful jungle drums and a 
chorus of multi-octaved 
Nashes chanting “I am a 
misfit” over a stadium-
worthy guitar line. This 
point of pride, of course, 
is only realized after 
one-and-a-half minutes 
of profane lambasting of 
“21st-century girls who 
can get fucked just as well 
as a man.” Then there’s 
the fact that — in a stroke 
of either genius or cheap 
identity crisis — that 
same riot-grrrl rant is 
underscored by a lo-fi, 
static-crackled solo from a 
seasoned opera singer.

Best Friend is sure to 
divide the crowd: More 
conventional (read: bor-
ing) tracks like “Paris” and 
“Early Christmas Present” 
will please older fans, but 
it’ll take a much more 
open mind to appreciate 
the outlandish scrapbook 
of honks and genres she 
takes up as a side hobby. 
It’s quite a cliff-jump from 
Bricks’ clean folk-rock to 
the heroin grind of “I Just 
Love You More” — on 
which Nash emits a series 
of Banshee screams that 
would put Yoko Ono to 
shame in an ear-piercing 
contest.

TRACKREVIEW

‘The Arrangement’
Beach House
SUB POP

A s dream-pop slowly takes over the airwaves, it’s hard to find a group that doesn’t overdose on breathy, introspective poetry. But Maryland duo Beach House, though not completely avoiding the plague, does it with humility: 
Somewhere in their wistful vocal pastorale and softly plucked melodies, the 
genre’s obligatory otherworldliness becomes more existential than extraterrestrial. 
A heavy B-side off their upcoming Zebra EP, “The Arrangement” sets up duets 
like “Do you say what you mean?/ You are only sixteen” inside a warm, earthly 
atmosphere, proving they can lure in any sucker with an ounce of feeling — not 
just the lovesick indie crowd.

P hantom Band” is the story of a group of Santa Cruz high-school misfits who meet up once a week 
for band practice — and, of course, 
to together overcome the challenges 
of the almighty growing pain. When 
a mysterious mute violinist joins 
the group, though, everything gets 
turned upside down, forcing the kids 

to re-examine their relationship with 
the world around them. 

Should make for a winning 
rehash of “The 
Breakfast Club” 
and “Glee,” right? 
Unfortunately, it’s 
more a hasty summa-
ry of both. The gang’s 
all here: the brain, the 
princess, the basket 
case, the criminal and 
the leader of the pack: 
a beautiful overachiever with a stick 
up her ass. And sophomore Master of 
Fine Arts playwright Krista Knight’s 
characters hardly evolve at all over 
the course of the play, leaving us 

unsure of what Knight was so afraid 
of. We only get insight into main 
character Deto’s past, and — though 

well-acted — even 
that storyline is far 
from groundbreak-
ing. Sorry, Deter, but 
John Bender had an 
alcoholic parent, too.

After all that, 
“Band” peeters out 
with a disappoint-
ing conclusion we 

could see coming from a mile away. 
In fact, the only part of the play that 
doesn’t make for complete deja vu is 
its parting “message” — a tacked-on 
lesson about the music of life being a 

combination of the good times and 
the bad. And even that feels force-fed, 
for obvious reasons. 

The vast majority of these down-
falls can be attributed to a lackluster 
script. The actors, on the other 
hand, are charming, and the set is 
a work of art: A giant suspended 
tree branch simulates the forest, 
and the lighting fluctuates perfectly 
with the tone of the dialogue. But 
with a theme this uninspired, the 
whole presentation is pretty much 
doomed. Unless you’re game for a 
particularly snoozeworthy sermon 
on coming of age in America, skip 
this unnecessary flashback to the 
horrors of high school.

Anthony (Gabriel Lawrence) — a 15-year-
old football hopeful whose only experience 
is breaking his arm before the first game 
— and Tony (Bowman Wright), Anthony’s 
deadbeat dad, who desperately wants to 
re-enter his son’s life. What follows is two-
and-a-half hours of generational bickering; 
lucky for us, the colossal argument is written 
in thought-provoking sociological prow-
ess, with a healthy side of tongue-in-cheek 
humor to make the serious shit go down.

With a minimalist set that your three-
year-old sister could assemble — stacked 
cardboard boxes and stretched white gar-
bage bags — Lawrence and Wright must do 
all the heavy lifting; and you better believe 
they deliver. Whether getting low to the 
Jackson 5’s “Shake Your Body (Down to 
the Ground),” heart-to-hearting about drug 
abuse or combating what Anthony calls 
“the black predisposition to failure,” both 
actors give it all they’ve got.

The ambitious “Oyster” is not without its 
rough patches. One disjointed scene watches 
a game of beer pong between Anthony 
and his Dartmouth frat brother Jeff (Mark 
Christine) turn into a nauseating show of 
bigotry, as Anthony is forced to perform the 
Sambo song. It’s certainly relevant, but feels 
pasted into an otherwise cohesive piece — 
an obvious cater to the college crowd. Even 
worse are a handful of pop-culture referenc-
es — “awkward turtle,” Lindsay Lohan, etc. 
— that stick out like cheap buzzwords in an 
otherwise intimate father-son conversation.

Hats go off to Christine for playing three 
characters, but he never leaves the shadow 
of his multifaceted co-stars. As the token 
white guy with a limited world view, he 
serves as a foil to the drama. Unfortunately, 
this also means that it’s his job to rake in 
the cheap laughs — with every hillbilly 
scratch of his potbelly. Overall, though, 
“Oyster” is an introspective escape from 
ignorance that will no doubt serve as a 
prompt for intelligent discussion long after 
the shock value off UCSD’s February show-
down has dissipated.

SPORTS� THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

USC error handed UCSD the set 30-26.
However, USC quickly turned things 

around, raising the intensity by dominating the 
second set 30-21. They continued their beat 
down into the third, out-hitting the Tritons 
.484 to .175 and winning the third set 30-23.

In the fourth set, UCSD took an early 11-4 
lead, staving off an attempted USC comeback 
that did end up narrowing UCSD’s lead to 
a mere two points. However, The Tritons 
clinched it 30-26 in the end.

A decisive fifth set typified the back-and-
forth nature of the match overall. A small 8-7 
Trojan lead was quickly reversed — courtesy 
of a 3-1 Triton run — giving UCSD the lead. 
However, tied again at 16-16, a UCSD attack-
ing error gifted USC the set 18-16, along with 
the match.

 “We were disappointed in the match,” head 
coach Kevin Ring said. “We weren’t disap-
pointed in our level of play, but the result. We 
worked hard and got off to a pretty good start. 
We played competitively and we played well in 
the match.”

After the close defeat to USC, the Tritons 
returned to face Pepperdine on Saturday at 
RIMAC Arena for their season-ending Senior 

Night celebration. For their final match, 
the Tritons came through to upset No. 3 
Pepperdine 28-30, 30-27, 29-30, 30-27 and 
15-12.

The first set was closely fought between 
both teams — evidenced by 19 ties in the set. 
Eventually, though, Pepperdine claimed the 
set at 30-28.

The Tritons started off the second set trail-
ing 11-6, but fought back for a 14-14 tie. 
After taking a 20-17 lead, UCSD repelled 
Pepperdine’s attempts to even the set, holding 
on for a 30-27 win. The contest was tied at one 
set per team.

Quick to respond, the Waves took control 
of the third set. They claimed it at a sizable 
30-19.

The fourth set was much far more dif-
ficult for both teams, and the lead fluctuated 
between the two. However, with the score tied 
at 21  points apiece, UCSD made a strong 9-6 
run to take the set at 30-27, forcing a fifth set.

Fritsch played a vital role in the Tritons’ 
eventual victory, sending down five kills in the 
fifth set. UCSD maintained the lead through-
out, and Pepperdine was only ever able to 
narrow UCSD’s lead to two points. After a kill 
from Joel Davidson, the Tritons took the set 

15-12 for the match win.
“Winning Game Two was the key,” Ring 

said. “It can be the decider sometimes in 
matches. Through the match, we kept fighting 
and we sent it to Game Five.”

In addition to being a nice going-away 
present, the victory was also a monumental 
showcase in terms of individual accomplish-
ments for the Triton seniors. Fritsch ended 
the night with 25 kills on .455 hitting, mak-
ing him second on the UCSD career-kills list 
with 1,403 kills. Spangler added 14 kills in the 
match and finished with a total of 1,491 career-
kills at UCSD — which makes him the school’s 
all-time career-kills leader.

The Tritons finished with a record of 11-19 
this season, and 6-16 against Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation teams. Although they did 
not reach the MPSF playoffs, Ring said he was 
encouraged by the improvement the Tritons 
showed throughout the season.

“The team has improved throughout the 
season, as well as in my five seasons here,” Ring 
said. “For next season, our goal is to try to get 
to MPSF playoffs.”

100 hurdles, placing her ninth in UCSD history. 
Already holding the school record in the 800-

meter race, Senior Daniel Anderson ran the 400-
meter this week in 48.91 seconds — the seventh 
best time in Triton history. Senior Leon Baham 
also dominated the 400-meter hurdles, winning 
by nearly two seconds.

In the UCSD Triton Invitational on April 23, 
the Tritons will compete against top-notch talent 
from across the country — including athletes 
from Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and other UC 
campuses. The Tritons will also host the CCAA 
Championships two weeks later on May 6.

“The Triton invite looks to be a really exciting 
meet, just looking at the caliber of athletes that 
are coming,” Ahner said. ”We’ve got a week off 
to get rested up and ready to go, and then we’re 
at home again — so we really could not ask for a 
better situation.”

on to win the game 2-1. 
“We dropped a tough game on Thursday,” 

junior third baseman Evan Kehoe said. “Tim 
Shibuya threw really well, but our offense 
didn’t pick him up with any run support. We 
made some adjustments after that game and 
ended up winning the next three games.”

In the second game, the Tritons seemed 
destined for a 0-2 hole in the series, entering 
the seventh inning four runs down. However, 
the Triton offense suddenly came alive in the 
seventh, turning in eight runs throughout the 
inning — forcing the Golden Eagles to make 
four pitching changes. 

The first six Tritons up to bat in the inning 
all reached base. Junior outfielder Kyle Saul 
gave the Tritons the lead with a three-run RBI 
triple. Senior starting pitcher Matt Rossman 
also had a solid outing on Friday: He tossed 

6.1 innings of three-run ball. UCSD tacked 
on two more runs in the eighth inning for a 
10-4 win. 

On Saturday and Sunday, the Tritons trav-
eled to Reeder Field for the final two games 
of the series on Saturday and Sunday. Game 
Three was a spectacle of Triton offensive 
talent: The team posted six runs in the fifth 
inning, punctuated by a grand slam from 
Kehoe — his sixth home run of the season. 
Junior outfielders Aaron Bauman and Saul 
also homered in the game.

Senior starting pitcher Kirby St. John 
allowed only three Golden Eagle runs on 14 
hits to notch the victory as UCSD went on to 
win the game at a score of 13-6. 

Trailing 4-1 into the sixth inning of the 
series’ final game, UCSD’s victory hinged 
on another unlikely comeback. Junior righty 
Guido Knudson had an uncharacteristic out-

ing on Sunday, lasting only four and two-
thirds innings and allowing four runs; how-
ever, the Tritons jumped back into the ring 
when senior second baseman Blake Tagmeyer 
drew a leadoff walk. Senior catcher Kellen Lee 
followed with a clutch two-run homer to left 
field, pulling UCSD within one run at 4-3. 

Sophomore outfielder Danny Susdorf 
came off the bench as a pinch hitter, doubled, 
and then advanced to third on a sacrifice 
bunt by junior infielder Grant Bauer. With a 
man in scoring position, senior first baseman 
Brandon Gregorich stepped up to the plate 
with two outs and knocked in the tying run. 
Tied 4-4, Saul drove in the game-winning run 
with a hit up the middle. 

Senior reliever Daniel Simmons also came 
up huge, shutting the Golden Eagles down for 
two and one-third innings. He allowed just 
one hit in relief. 

“All weekend, we found ourselves behind 
late in the games,” Lee said. “Things weren’t 
going our way for the most part. Usually 
teams get caught in the fact that they are los-
ing, but we remained calm and didn’t worry 
about the score during the game. That keeps 
us focused and able to perform and comeback 
— that was the key for us this weekend.” 

With the series win, UCSD improved 
to 37-6 overall and 27-5 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. The Tritons 
will now head into a crucial series with No. 
10 Cal State Dominguez Hills — who stand at 
34-11 overall and 24-8 in CCAA play — start-
ing April 25. The series will be a battle for No. 
1, as the Toros trail the Tritons by three games 
in the conference.

BASEBALL — When they dropped 
the first leg of their four-game series 
against Cal State Los Angeles at Triton 
Ballpark on April 15, the No. 3 Tritons 
found themselves in unfamiliar terri-
tory. However, the team bounced back 
on April 16 with a come-from-behind 
10-4 win, and proceeded to take the 
next two at Reeder Field by scores of 
13-6 and 5-4 on April 17. By the end of 
the road trip, they had improved their 
away record to 13-1.

The series opener showcased a 
pitcher’s duel: The Tritons starting 
pitcher junior Tim Shibuya throwing 
a complete game gem, allowing just 
two runs on nine hits; however, UCSD 
offense could not answer two early 
Golden Eagle runs, and CSULA went

TRACK & FIELD — With the UCSD Triton 
Invitational slated for next weekend — a meet that 
attracts an elite, international field of teams — the 
Triton track-and-field team did some fine-tuning at 
the Soka Peace Invitational on April 17 to prepare for 
the season’s home stretch. 

UCSD had a phenomenal week on the track: 
Seven individual athletes recorded times ranking 
among the 10 best in UCSD history. The Tritons also 
broke several stadium records, including a run by 
junior Kelly Fogarty that bested the mark of current 
U.S. Olympian Carmelita Jeter.

“In the last two or three weeks, I really feel we’ve 
put all the pieces in place to head into our conference 
championships,” women’s coach Darcy Ahner said. 
“On both sides — men and women — we’re really 
ready, and I think the team feels it too. The momen-
tum is there, and it’ll be a lot of fun.”

Earlier in the week, on April 15, senior Linda 
Rainwater set a new school record in the heptathlon 
at the Mt. SAC/California Invitational heptathlon.  
Rainwater, who is the 2008 Division-II national 
champion in the event, topped her previous record 
of 5,303 points with a fifth-place finish of 5,333 
points. Junior Stephanie LeFever also competed in 
the event, tallying a personal best of 5,193 points. 

Rainwater posted another school record of 5’ 
10.5” in the high jump at the heptathlon. The 
mark fell just one-fourth of an inch below the per-
sonal best of Coach Ahner, who is a former Western 
Athletic Conference athlete of the year.

“I told her she has six inches to go, since she’s six 
inches taller than me,” Ahner said. “But I’m just jok-
ing about that. She’s just a few points short of my best 
score in the heptathlon, too, and she’s going to bust 
right through both of those marks and go right past 
me. It’s really fun to see that.”

At the Soka meet, Fogarty and senior Christine 
Merrill blasted past their competition in the 100-
meter dash: Fogarty finished first in 11.75 seconds 
and Merrill took second at 11.94 seconds. Fogarty’s 
time broke the stadium record set by U.S. Olympian 
Jeter, the world’s second fastest woman ever in race. 
The mark made Merrill a NCAA Division-II provi-
sional qualifier — meaning she could be qualified 
for as many as seven events at the NCAA Division-II 
Championships, just over a month away.

Senior Leah Murphy was another Triton head-
liner, comfortably winning the long jump with a 
mark of 19’ 1.25”. The jump was the third farthest in 
UCSD history, and a NCAA Provisional Qualifier. 
Sophomore Caitlin Meagher took her first foray into 
the Triton record books with a time of 14.79 in the

UCSD closed out a rollercoaster 2010 season with a string of tough home matches last week against steep competition. 
The final run began against the nation-
ally top-ranked team Cal Baptist on April 
14, then continued versus conference foes 
University of Southern California and 
Pepperdine University on April 16 and 
April 17, respectively. 

Despite a difficult slate of opponents, 
the Tritons managed to send their seniors 
off on a high note. The match against 
Cal Baptist ended 25-30, 30-14, 30-28 and 
30-26 in the Tritons’ favor, marking UCSD’s 
first win over the Lancers since 2005 and 
bumping UCSD’s record against Cal Baptist 
up to 4-11.

The first set started in favor of UCSD, 
until a late rally by the Lancers gave them 

the set 30-25.
The Tritons made amends for their first-

set slip-up by dominating in the second. 
They took a quick 11-3 lead and allowed 
one attack error throughout the rest of the 
set, breezing through to a 30-14 victory.

The teams fought equally hard in the 
third set, tying the score six times and 
taking multiple turns as leaders. The last 
tie occurred at 28-28, right before Frank 
Fritsch and Calvin Ross created a set point 
for the Tritons. Fritsch’s kill sealed the set 
30-28 for UCSD.

UCSD grabbed an early lead in the 
fourth set to finish the match quickly and 
cleanly. However, Cal Baptist retaliated 
late in the set by narrowing the score to 
28-26, though UCSD still clutched the lead. 
Fortunately for the Tritons, Ross and Carl 
Eberts collaborated for a block and a kill, 

respectively, to give the team some leverage. 
Jason Spangler closed out the set 30-26 with 
a game-winning kill

Overall, the Tritons bettered the Lancers 
in the match, hitting a .304 average to 
Cal Baptist’s .218. In the second set alone, 
UCSD hit at a .706 average.

After a day of rest, the Tritons were back 
in action Friday at RIMAC Arena against 
USC. It was a close match, but the Trojans 
outlasted the Tritons in the fifth set for a 
26-30, 30-21, 30-23, 26-30 18-16 match 
victory.

UCSD took the lead in the first set until 
USC came back to tie the set 13-13. There 
were eight more ties in the set — the last at 
23-23 — before the Tritons took the lead 
on a Fritsch kill. A kill from Spangler and a
