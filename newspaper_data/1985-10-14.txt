Perry told the Guardian that 
the Los Angeles Times, Saturday 5 
October Incorrectly reported that 
she "claimed the broken affair 
(with Atkinson) left her greatly 
depressed." Perry said, "[ made 
no such claim." and added that

himself. 
Perry is interested in the 

principle of the case. She said 
the case is a "social issue as 
much as a personal issue," and 
thinks that if she wins the suit it 
will set a precedent that "might 
be able to protect pregnant 
women in the future." She said 
she feels very strongly that -it is 
wrong for persons in 
relationships to lie to each 
other." 

If she WinS the lawsuit. Perry 
said she will donate a large sum 
of the compensary payment to 
the United Nations International

Huff said the "defendant

Young conservatism: another country 
Walking back through the plaza the other day just after participating 

in a forum with a few conservative foes we found ourselves unable to 
disengage from a comment that was made by the "other side" during the 
discussion . Our foe ventured to say, and seemed to hold this as a 
conviction , that poverty does not really exist in the United States and 
that there is work available for those who are inclined to do it. His 
evidence to back this assertion was that he is a self-made man who has 
worked tirelessly all of his life to attain his present position as a young, 
healthy, conservative ideologue , and if those folks on welfare followed 
his very accessible road to capitalist freedom they would maintain the 
same ideals as he - as they would reap what they would have sown. 

He and his cohort went on to say that many of the programs and 
legislations that have been enacted since the New Deal have caused the 
downfall of America's "equal opportunity society," as the government has 
been guilty of spoon feeding a lazy populace. Moreover, they preened , 
civil rights theories such as comparable worth and affi rmative action 
actually are endangering America's economic growth and productiVity. In 
fact , they could not think of one instance wher either welfare programs 
or hiring quota based on race or gender have helped anyone. What 
these programs really have created , they concluded , is the antithesis of 
their original intent - that is reverse discrimination and a huge 
national bureaucracy that is forced to practice a type of democratic 
socialism because of the demands of the Welfare tate . 

While we were mulling over why it ha become so ommonpolace for 
members of our generation to think this way, one of us had the idea to 
go down to Southeast San Diego the very next day and questlon one of 
their "trilateral" offenders, (a black woman on welfare , for instance), as 
to her thoughts on this phenomena. 

An instrucitve opportunity for this interaction arose on Saturday 
morning, and off we went to the anti-apartheid march that commenced 
at Lincoln High School on Imperial Avenue and ended a mile later at 
Martin Luther King, ]r. Park in one of San Diego's dusty, teemi ng valleys. 

The woman who spoke with us was not what you would call lavishly 
dressed , or robust, but rather undernourished with a weU-worn face . We 
asked her how old she was, (she appeared to be in her late thirties), 
and she told us that she would rum twenty-six next month. She also 
informed us that she had four children , from ages two to seven, was 

separated from her husband who was last heard from when "he took my 
car and the kids' stereo which I worked to buy last Christmas for two 
years - but they didn't care about that music after a while 'cause they 
weren't used to hearin' it no more." We asked her if she worked. She 
sa id that she did work as a hotel deaningwoman downtown and that 
she also took care of her neighbors' kids some nights because "they 
both work the graveyard and can't afford one of them givin' up a job." It 
turns out that she makes between $600 and $700 a month plus about 
$300 in food stamps which places her way below the poverty line. She 
lives in a two bedroom apartment in Logan Heights which costs her 
$375 a month , excluding her monthly bills, payments for the car she 
had to buy, childcare for the mornings that she works, clothes for her 
constantly growing kids, and an extra $100 a month for eye-care 
treatments for her five year old son who "can't even tell his brothers and 
sisters apart sometimes." 

We asked her if her children were well-fed and she said , "we eat all 
right fo r the first couple weeks. lots of potatoes. greens. and some 
hamburger once in a while . Towards the end of the month we're eatin' 
lots of rice and them com tortillas. instant oats every morning, and 
drinkin' lots of water. I try to give my children a glass of milk each day 
so them bones don 't get soft - the oldest one ,Lisa, is in school so she 
gets some kind of lunch every day - takes some of it home sometimes 
for the little one." We asked her what her plans were for the future and 
she said. ·'1 don 't know about no future yet but soon I'm gonna quit that 
job and start takin' welfare 'cause my kids ain't gonna grow-up without 
no mommy and a daddy and 'cause I can get all those free health 
benefits and cause my boss is startin' to take all of my tips and mostly 
cause workin ' at that minimum wage pays me less than the welfare ."

Nazi Phrase 

Editor: 
We would like to draw your 

attemion to a particular student 
on campus. He can be 
recognized by the fine leather 
bag he carries, upon whi h is 
written "Albeit Macht Frei " in 
stylized Gothic lettering. This 
Nazi slogan greeted the millions 
of victims - Jews and non-Jews 
alike - upon their arrival to the 
gates of the concentration 

camps. Literally translated , it 
means "Work Makes Freedom." 
This was posted in purposeful 
irony and in stark contrast to the 
death and enslavement within 
the camps. 

We are not attempting to limit 
this student's freedom of speech, 
we are simply trying to infonn 
others as to the exact nature of 
hIS statement. We fi nd this 
slogan offenSIve to us as human 
beings. There IS no dIfference 
between his carrying thIS phrase 

upon his bag or adorning his 
bag with a swastika. Silence is 
complicity - let him know how 
you feel!

Freedom of Speech? 
Editor: 
I am an exchange student 

from West Germany. With this 
letter I would like to share some 
of my thoughts with you. 

A few days ago. I saw a 
student canying a brown leather 
bag on which there was the 
phrase. "Albeit macht [rei ." This 
sentence is the cynical 
jusitfication and symbol for the 
most tremendous killing machine 
the world has ever seen: the 
concentration camp of the Third 
Reich . 

This phrase is in such bad 
taste that it needs no 
explanation. In the Germany of 
today. fortunately , we also have 

freedom of speech . bur 
compared with the US it is 
limited. The lesson of the horrors 
of the Third Reich was that 
never again were hatted and war 
to have thier origins in Germany. 
Therefore, according to the 
German constitution. it is 
prohibited to preach racial 
hatted or war, and also to show 
emblems (like the one 
mentioned above) of the Nazis.

Rock Porn whose responsibility is it? 
By JEANNE BUMPUS 

As with most controversial 
issues, pornographic rock IS 
most easily perceived. and hence 
presented , as divided into two 
distinct camps; there are those 
who suppon the effons of the 
Parents Music Resource Center 
and those who oppose them. 
Such division not only allows 
those Involved in the debate to 
defend their clarion positions 
whtle avoiding the inteUectually 
hazy a reas between the twO 
extremes, it also proVides for a 
much more entenaming 
engagement: The Washington 
WIVes meet theIr match - those 
paragons of evil, moral 
degradation and decadence -
the Hollywood Wives. 

But where are the Hollywood 

Wives? While the PMRC and 
other ami·pornrock activists 
have made clear their positions . 
those on the other side have 
been loath to do so. their 
reasons ostensibly being that 
there really is no need for their 
involvement - the one pany 
that is active in the controversy 
is doing a first rate job of 
entertaining everyone. 

But, alas. by definition there 
must be at least two positions in 
every controvers}'; so grudgmgly, 
I take mine - behind the FIrst 
Amendment. 

The First Amendment serves 
as the most effective institutional 
bamer agai nst the invective 
hurled by the WashinglOn 
WIves. lromcally, it also ensures 

the rights that allow the PMRC 
and other simIlarly minded 
individuals to assemble and 
petition theIr case. Hence. the 
PMRC, the Women Against 
Pornography, the National 
Coalition Against Television 
Violence and others are anning 
themselves with the same 
democratic stuff with which we 
are constructl ng our defense. 
Needless 10 say. It is not 
impregnable 

As we Sit comfonably behmd 
our construct. chuckling over the 
absurdity of the pomrock 
controversy, the annles of the 
New Right may be advanCing. 

Due largely to the effons of the 
PMRC, 19 record companies will 
soon put warning labels on 

albums that are "violent or 
sexuaUy expliCit." 

Rock an d Roll is just chock full 
of nasty stuff. Refere nces to 
sadomasochism, drugs. suicide 
and "actual satan ism" abound. 
Good god . who can blame them 
for wanting to protect their kids 
from the unknown effects of 
overexposure? Parents have the 
right if not the duty to restrict 
thei r child 's immediate or 
convenient access to a rock 
group which extols the joys of 
rape. ParentS should take the 
responsibIlity of applying their 
own cri teria in detennining what 
they will allow to be played in 
their homes. I wholeheanedly 
agree that much of the content 
and performance In today's 

music is panicularly 
objectionable , but there is no 
identifiable or manageable 
standard by which to judge it. 
What is to limit the ratings to 
material that is violent or 
seJ(ually explicit? Why not issue 
warnings on the basis of 
"offensive" and give purchasers 
of the new Wham album fair 
warning? 

On the surface. the effons of 
the PMRC are admirable as well 
as innocuous. ·We Just want 
labeling." Labeling is good. I have 
nothing against labeling. Other 
than increasing the moppets' 
demand for and attentiveness to 
those songs that have 
conveniently been identified as

Terrorism Uncovered; Part '3 
By DA VI RICHARD 

The question of how to 
prevent terrorism is one that is 
as old as terrorism itself. 
Different states have adopted 
different measures. leading to an 
international pif'-.emeal approach 
to the problem. West Germany, 
for instance. has been 
notOriously acquiescent to 
terrorist demands while Israel 
has been notoriously reactionary. 
Neither approach has been 
particulalry effective; in fact there 

i~ little evidence that the strategy 
of realization deters terrorism -
indeed it may promote an 
endless cycle of violence. 

Howeve r, in global terms, the 
world as a "community" has 
attempted to curb terrorism 
primarily through international 
law. In this essay we will 
examine the historical legal 
approach to terrorism, 

approaches which have yielded 
only mild success in addressing 
the problem. 
The Historical Roots of Lqalism 

The first international effort to 
collectively deter terrorism took 
place in 1937 following the 
assassination of King Alexander I 
of Yllgosiavia in Marseiles in 
1934. However, informal 
agreements am"ng nations 
during the 19th century led to 
the extradition of anarchists who 
were tenned "the enemy of all . 
governments: What is so 
striking about the 1937 
Convention is its assumption 
that the unity of nations would 
act as a deterrent even at a time 
when the League of Nations was 
dissolving at an alarming rate . 
The conviction somehow 
remained that the international 
system could impose order (a 

reaffirmation of the liberalism 
embodied in earlier efforts such 
as Wilsonian foreign policy. the 
Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the 
League). 

The 1937 Convention was 
signed by 24 nations, but never 
came into force . Only India fully 
ratified it. After World War II, 
preventive measures 
encompassed a much broader 
range of activities. Whereas the 
1937 Convention defined 
terrorism as acts designed to 
create a state of terrOr in the 
minds of the public. efforts after 
World War II were aimed . 
primarily by the West. at 
preventing the export of 
terrorism from another stare. 
Thus. the legalistic approach no 
longer involved JUSt a question of 
sovereignty, but reflected the 
increasingly bipolar nature of 

imernatinal politics. American 
efforts were aimed at 
piscouraging guerilla warfare and 
maimaining the status quo while 
the Soviet Union, internally in a 
state of disarray, continued its 
diplomatic attack on colonialism. 

With the emergence of the 
Third World as a pot~nt force in 
international politics in the '60s 
and 70s, the argument over 
terrorism developed yet another 
dimension. Qualitatively. there 
were changes in the type of 
violence the world was seeing. 
Terrorism was taking on an 
increasingly transnational 
character (with a dramatic surge 
in 19(9). and the media brought 
the terrorist message into the 
living rooms of Americans and 
Europeans alike in an instant. 
The Palestinians' simultaneous 
destruction of three hijacked 

jumbo jets in Jordan in 1970 and 
the Black September assault of 
the Israeli Olympic athletes in 
1972 was witnessed not by tens, 
or even hundreds of people, but 
by millions. Terrorism had hit 
prime-time. Similarly, the 
communication boorn encourged 
aggressive vocalization of 
propaganda, confUSing the 
concept of terrorism with other 
issues. For instance, the attempt 
by the United States in 1972 to 
adopt an international 
convention was rejected by Syria, 
among other Arab nations, as not 
addressing the most dangerous 
form of "terrorism" - that which 
is directed by the state. Not 
COinCide ntally, the Syrian attack 
came about the same time as the 

the Hurricanes 

united Arab-African attack on 
Zionism in the General Assembly 
of the United Nations . 

The Inherent Weakness of 
International Law 

But, 10 say imernational law 
has "failed" is 10 assurne that it 
could have worked in the first 
place. History has shown time 
and again that collective action 
o n such a grand scale as the UN 
(or the League) rarely has 
produced any remarkable results. 
More often than not, each 
country's respective interests 
Intertere WIth ideal behavior, that 
is, behavior which respects the. 
right of state sovereignty. Both 
the Soviets and the United States· 
have shown a tremendous 

capacity to "deplore" terrorism 
while supporting 
"revolutionaries." The dubious 
nature of national liberation 
movements reflects the 
ideological split between the twO 
superpowers, and, to a lesser 
extent. has provided the Third 
World with a raUying cry 
directed primarily against the 
West. 

The legalist approach , as is so 
common in intemational law, 
then hits an impasse attempting 
to juggle sta·te interests with ideal 
behavior. The record with 
terrorism is no different. While 
the year may be 1985 . the 
idealists have yet to learn the 
lessons of 1937.

the latest Modey Crue album

songs, or worse yet, see them

No, labeling alone will not do 
For this reason the PMRC 
secured a enate subcommittee 
hearing on the subject of 
pornographic rock. It looks as If 
the threat of legislauon used to 
secure the "voluntary" 
compliance of these 19 record 
companies may become a reality. 
With Susan Baker, wife of former 
Senate majority leader and 1988 
republican Presidenttal candidate 
Howard Baker, as vice-president 
and the wives of Who's on 
Capitol Hill as members, the 
PMRC wields some real clout. 
Though they present themselves 
as moderates, their actions speak 
otherwise. To seek federal 
intervention In a clearly social 
issue is to reveal themselves as 
members of the New Right , that 
ominous spectre that is haunting 
America. 

Some issues are not fit for 
legislation. Porn rock is one of 
them. Standards of acceptabIlity 
are completely subjective and 
application of these standards, 
completely arbitrary. How, for 
example does one detennine the 
degree of sexual explicitness? 

Lyrics alone do not a dirty 
song make. The musical group 
The Time , has put a copulating 
couple's recitation of the Pledge 
of Allegiance to music. Is this 
obscene? It is beyond obscene. 
Most would agree that the Beach 
Boys are a pretty wholesome lot; 
yet, James Watt (of afrirmative 
action fame) would not allow 
them to play at the DC Founh of 
July celebrations because of the 
affniry they had for the wrong 
element. The absurdiry of this 
claim did elicit a public response 
in the form of a Dead Kennedy's 
Kill-a-Watt concen and myriad 
"wrong element" t-shlns. 
Nevenheless, the Beach Boys did 
not play. Should the Beach Boys' 
albums bear a label warning 
parents that while the record 
maybe salutary, their kids' 
acquaintances may not? 

Answers ro these questions are 
not ro be found within the· scope 
of government. Unronunately 
this is no guarantee against 
government intervention. 

On the contrary, the issue 
invites fr;deral involvement 
because the electronic media are 
licensed by the Federal 
Communications Commission . 
One branch or the government, 
the Supreme Coun, has already 
determined that obscene speech 
is not protected by the First 
Amendment because it is "urrerly 
WIthOut redeeming social 
importance." In 1978, the FCC 
upheld a ban on the 
broadcasting of cenain salacious 
words, arguing that broadcasting 
pervasively intruded its speech 
into the pnvacy of the home. 

The precedent for the federal 
government ro engage in thought 
control has already been 
established, violating 
fundamental tenets In our_ 
democracy; that prior restraint of 
speech is a much greater threat 
to the freedom of speech than is 
punishing a person once they 
have spoken. If a government 
takes it upon itself to decide 
what can or cannot be broadcast 
the public does not even known ' 
what it is forbidden to hear.

Women Changing Sexual Roles? 
By KATHY BECKETT 

Although the days of bra-
burnings are over, the impact of 
the sexual revolution is far from 
gone, On the contrary, the 
changes brought about by the 
questioning and susequent 
rejection of traditional sex roles 
affects all Americans both at 
home and on the job. 

"Barefoot and pregnant in the 
kitchen" no longer is an accurate 
ponrayal or American women 
who in ever-increasing numbers 
are postponing, and even 
foregoing, marriage and children 
in lieu of full time careers. Since 
1950, the number of women in 
the work force has more than 
tripled. 

Fueled by a growing body of 
research suggesting that the 
dilterent patterns of behavior 
shown by men and women are 
largely a result of the 
socialization process rather than 
biological facrors , women's rights 
ac tivists have lobbied ror 
legislative and institutional policy 
changes that would promote and 
sustatn equality between the 
sexes. Women activists have 
challenged the claim that women 
are "naturally" dependent, 
passive and weak-willed; and 
have rejected the macho image 
or men as strong and sill!nt 
leaders whose expresion of 
emotion consists of an 
occasional grunt. 

Indeed, many changes have 
been wrought from the 
denunCiation of traditional sex 

roles; issues such as civil rights , 
comparable wonh and the right 
to abonion have gained 
widespread support. Despite the 
pOSitive steps taken, though, the 
goal of equality between the 
sexes (the consistent practice of 
not favoring either sex by vinue 
of thier biological make-up) is far 
from being realized . 

In 1984, full-time working 
women earned, only 62 percent 
of the income of their male 
counterpans. More than that, 
education seems to make no 
difference; the average female 
college graduate earns slightly 
less tham the average male high 
school graduate. One common 
justification for this tremendous 
wage gap is that women simply 
gravitate roward cenain 
occupations which happen to be 
lower paying. This response is 
inadequate; it rails to explain or 
even address why our SOCiety 
conSistently places a higher value 
on services tradi tionally provIded 
by men than it does on those 
more commonly performed by 
women, even when these 
"women's professlons."such as 
nursing and teaching, may 
require more training and are 
more SOCially valuable that the 
higher paying "male profeSSIOns" 
such as truck-drivmg and street-
cleaning. 

Despite the fact that the 
majority of married women with 
children work outside the home 
,¥omen continue to be held ' 

San Diego is one of the world 's best sport fishing areas. 
Why not take advantage of this? Take an afternoon off

largely responSible for the duties 
of housekeeping and parenting. 
People are suprised to learn that 
34 percent of women with 
children under the age of seven 
months work full-time, and may 
question the devotion of these 
women to their children. No 
corresponding stigma is 

attatched to a "working father"' 
in raCt, the term seems ' 
redundanr. Because these 
workmg women typ ically earn 
less than theIr husbands, their 
work IS seen as more expendable 
and less important. In fact, it is 
precisely because women are 
largely responsible for parenting 
that they are less able to rutly 

devote themselves to their 
careers; consequently, women are 
seen by employers as less 
dependable, making them the 
least likely candidates for 
promotion . Combine the 
demands of childbirth, parenting 
and housekeeping with the 
reluctance of employers and the 

government to adopt a policy of 
comparable worth and to 
institutlonahze the proVISIon or 
day-care facilities and 
materniry/ paterniry leave ; the 
result is that women are forced 
to remain in dead-end, low 
paying jobs that leave them with 
the flexibility they need to meet 
the demands of the "double 

burden." 
The lack of child-care facllmes 

provided by the govemment is a 
senous problem for working 
mothers, especially single and 
low-income women . Public day 
care centers were among the first 
Hems to be cut after the passage 
of Proposition 13. The US is one 
of the few industrialized nations 
without a national, 
comprehensive day-care policy; 
wuhout such a policy, it is orten 
more economIcal for low-income 
women to stop working 
altogether and collect welfare 
payments that to work and cover 
the expense of child-care. 
Middle class working couples 
spend an average of nearly 30 
percent of their combined 
incomes on child care for two 
children. Often, this expense is 
seen to be the woman's 
responsibiliry as a mo·ther, an 
expense that, because of her 
lesser earning power, she cannot 
meet. 

That the wage gap has 
remamed relatively constant for 
three decades suggests that full 
equality cannot be achieved until 
[he poliCies of pnvate and public 
employers, as well as the 
behaVIOr of men and women 
themselves, are designed to 
promote the funherance of that 
goal. Until that time, a woman 
will remain hostage in a cycle 
that perpetuates inequaliry and 
dependency, thus blocking her 
path to self-actualization.

A Futile Policy 
Editor: 
An open leuer to Dr. Watson: 

We , the students of Warren 
College tudent Government, 
would like to take this 
opportuniry to voice our great 
displeasure with the alcohol 
policy that was recently 
Implemented. We object to thiS 
new polIcy [or several 
fundamental reasons. 

FIrSt, the new policy IS largely 
unenforceable. We think that 
even you would agree that it IS 
an exerCise In futility to expect 

that no one under the age of 21 
WIll consume alcohol under the 
new policy. Very few students 
are deterred from drinking even 
under the strictest rules. You 
cannot expect that the case will 
be different on this campus. In 
addinon, consider the 
consequences of students going 
off-campus to drink . You are 
indirectly encouraging students 
to drink and drive. We are sure 
that thiS cannot have been your 
intent. onetheless, It Will be the 
end result. Arc rou willing to 
ac ept the responsibility for thiS 
outcome? 

econd , given that most 
students refuse to adhere to the 
new polIcy, the manpower that 
would be necessary to en[or e it 
simply does not eXIst. It IS 

virtually impossible for a small 
group of resident advisers to 
police such a large number of 
apanment and dormitory 
complexes. Moreover, It is 
patently unfair to ask an RA, who 
is often friends with his or her 
reSidents, to enforce your new 
policy. It is clear that , in fact, 
many do not. 

Finally, to bar kegs from 
campus makes no logical sense. 
A group of students who wish to 
have a party are going to be as 
likely to fill a garbage can or 
their bathtub with cans of beer 
as they are to go out and get a 
keg

of time into considering more 
responsible and reahstic 
proposals concerning the alcohol 
issue . We think that you would 
be wise to reconsider the alcohol 
issue . We ask you to think 
carefully about why you are at 
this university. You are here to 
guide students toward the most 
intelligent decisions of their own, 
not to dictate what you believe to 
be the most correct decisions. 

Thank you for your attention. 
We hope that all groups on this 
campus will be able to work 
together to reach a fair solution 
to this problem.

Vendor Follies 
Editor: 

I guess the only real quesnon 
to ask IS why. Why are the 
vendors being eliminated from 
campus? I'm ure someone in the 
univerSity knows, but that person 
hasn't made It common 
knowledge . As to the real reasons 
behind thiS "change of poli cy," I 
can only speculate. How can I do 
anything else? I wasn 't asked , or 
even informed, of the decision. 
Maybe the vendors are 
considered a bad influence on 
the students - you know, like 
they introduce some aspects of 
reality onto the campus. There 
really are decent, likable people 
in this world who don't have a 
college education or who are not 
being set upon a..successful 
career by their parents. 

Maybe it's a matter of 
economics. The vendors are 
bleeding off money vital to the 
survival of the poor La Jollan 
merchant. UC5D, In its 
benevolent wisdom, seeks only to 
prevent the starvation o[ the 
families of these La Jollan 
businessmen. 

Could it be aesthetics? It's not 
that the vendors are distasteful. 
Many of their products are 
handmade and quite wonderfully 
crafted. And who could term 
jewelry or flowers unsightly. 

No, it's none of that. It's JUSt 
that it doesn 't follow the artistic 
direction of the entire university. 
A university is a place of 
knowledge , a hallowed collection 
of cement monoliths, pure and 
unadorned as is the knowledge 
comained within . God help us if 
the university were to be tainted 
with flowers , ealthen potS, 
creativity and li[e. 

It is also possible that I've 
missed the pOint of this policy 
change completely. It might be 
the grass. The vender's were 
preventing th e students from 
killing off the grass. 

Well , I figure it's better this 
way. The reasons are far too 
diffIcult for me to fathom. 
There's sort of a comfort in all of 
this. The university knows. 
DeCisions like these are best left 
to those at the helm. Even 
though you never see them, they 
know your wishes, your heart, 
and your very soul.

SIO researcher plays role 
in finding Titanic 
By MA IT I..AIT 

F lYE WEEKS ago scientist Roben Ballard discovered the Titanic at about 12,000 
feet , 400 miles off the coast of 
Newfoundland. Some of the 
information Ballard used to 
locate the vessel, which sank 73 
years ago, was contTibwed by Dr. 
Fred Spiess of Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography. 

Spiess and his colleague, 
William Ryan of Columbia 
University , led expeditions in 
1980 and J 981 to find the 
Titamc. These expeditions were 
financed by multimillionaire Jack 
Grimm, who also financed 
expeditions in search of the 
Loch Ness Monster. Bigf{)(){ and 
Noah's Ark. 

Although the expeditions led 
by Spiess and Ryan failed to 
locate the ship, their voyage was 
a technical success. The 
equipment, such as the "Deep . 
Tow." proved to be excellent in 
mapping the sea Door. Pictures 
from the "Deep Tow' led Grimm 
to believe that they had found 
the Titanic's propeller. Dr. Spiess 
disagrees with him. saying, "I 
think it was JUSt a pile of rocks." 
Spiess' missions also helped to 
provide a starting place for other 
searchers like Ballard. 

Raising the Titanic is currently 
believed to be technologically 
and financially Improbable. "In 

addition," Spiess said , "The 
treasures on board are probably 
minimal judging by the ship's 
manifest and insurance claims." 

Ballard has not released the 
coordinates of the Titanic's 
position , for fear of treasure 
seekers. 

Spiess agrees with Ballard that 
nobody needed to die the night 
the ship went down. Spiess said , 
"The ship Californian was 
probably no more than 10 rrules 
from the Titanic when It struck 
the iceberg. Unfortunately, it was 
common practice in those days 
to shut down the engInes and 
tum off the radio at night." He 
also said, "It is rumored that 
some of the passengers told the 
captain they saw Dares, but he 
didn't take them seriously and 
went back to bed.' 

The Titanic was found virtually 
Intact in the dark depths of the 
ocean. where very little of the 
water's corrosive factors like salt 
and plant life exist. The pictures 
taken on Ballard's trip show 
uncorked cases of wine and 
unbroken delicate china plates. 
Some people conjecture that , 
because of the cold temperature 
of the water, there may be 
preserved boches. "This is not 
likely. We don't lind whale 
bodies on the sea Hoor when 

they die. There is more life than 
people think that far underwater. 
There could, however, be 
skeletons on board: Spiess said. 

Since the discovery, Gnmm 
has voiced a desire to go back 
and salvage some of the 
valuables from the ship. Spiess 
said if Grimm asks him to lead 
another expedition he will "listen 
to the proposal, but would only 
go if there was a good SCientific 
reason ." Spiess said that the 
discover Itself "may not have 
added much valuable 
information to the science field 
but the importance lies In the 
successful application of 
technology and what can be 
done with it" 

Currently, Spiess has other 
adventures planned. The major 
project he has in mind is 
observing and collecung data on 
plate techlOnics and underwater 
spring activity off the Florida 
plateau. 

On November II , 1985 there 
lvill be a film festival at SIO 
which will feature the films of 
the Titanic from Ballard's 
expedition along With an 
appearance from the 
photographer or Ballard himself.

Regent application 
deadline approaches 
By BARBARA SOBEL 

T HE UNNERSITY of California Board of Regents is looking for a 
new student regent the only 
official representation students 
have in university policy. 

According to Linda Sabo, a 
UCSD senior, fonner student 
regent and preSident of the 
Student Body President's Council 
(SBPC), "You don't have to be a 
student body president to be a 
regent. The regents want an 
average student who plays 
intra murals or Intercollegiate 
sports and who studies at the 
library." 

Student regent applicants are 
interviewed in November by the 
Regional Nominating 
Commissions, each of which 
consist of one graduate and one 
undergraduate from each 
campus. The northern region 
(Berkeley, San Francisco, Davis, 
and Santa Cruz) "~ll nominate 
four students for the pOSition, 
while the southern region (San 
Diego, Irvine, Riverside , Los 
Angeles, and Santa Barbara) will 
nominate five . 

Three of the mne semi-
finalists wtl be chosen by the 
SBPC to be formally mtervlewed 
by a regents' speCial selection 
commmee. 

The Regents ' committee is not 
limited to selecnng one of these 
three finalists. However, the 
student regent who is finally 
selected must be approved by 
the BPC. 

The "regent-designate" WIll be 
chosen at the regents' Februaty 
board meeting. From February 
until the student regent's tenn 
offICially begms July 1. 1986, the 
student IS invited to participate 
in all the board meetings and 
commmees hut without the right 
to vote. A student regent can not 
concurrently hold the regent 
posmon and another student 
office. 

"The SBPC IS looking [or 
students who are articulate, 

skillful, can explain the structure 
of the university system, and 
who have experience in the 
univerSity ," said Greg Arnold, AS 
vice president of external affairs 
and UCSD member of the SBPC. 

'Students are asked on the 
initial application what they 
condsier to be the three most 
important issues faCing higher 
education In California today, -
what steps the regems should 
take with respect to these issues, 
and what he or she could 
contribute to the board if 
selected as the student regent. 

The interviewing committees 
will ask the applicants to 
respond LO cetain hypothencal 
situations and issues. For 
instance, In a typical interview, 
the applicant will be asked how 
he or she would reaCt in a 
situation where views di ffered 
from those of the SBPC. 

Saba said she would respond 
to thiS question: 'I w!ll give you 
Cthe SBPC) an opportunity to 
vOice your OpinIOnS, but I won't 
sUppOrt something I don 't agree 
with." 

- 0 political quesllons are to 
be asked of the applicants 
throughout the applieallon 
process," Arnold said To ensure 
the student regent selection 
process is carried out Without 
biases, the application llself 
states, "The state constitution 
provides that regents shall be 
persons broadly renecuve of the 
economic , cultural an SOCial 
diversity of the state , Includ ing 
mmonries and women ." The 28 
member Board of Regents acts as 
the board of directors for the 
umverSlty Twenty of the board 
members are appOinted by the 
Govemor for 12-year terms. 
Seven of the individuals on the 
board, such as the Governor and 
University preSident Gardner, 
hold 'ex ofTIclo' poslllons. In

the state const ituti on 10 Include 
a student board of regents. The 
Board of Regents establishes 
university poliCies. This inch.tdes

university's $4 billion budget. 
university owned property and

appOint the president 01 the 
univerSity , university chancellors , 
and the directors of major 
research centers , in addition to 
establishmg university policy on 

affirmative aciton and admission 
issues. 

Student regents are asked to 
walk a fine line. Are they 
students first or are they regents 
first? "You are in nobody's camp, 
but yo u are in everybody'S 
camp ," Sabo said . 

Arnold emphaSIZed , "The 
Board of Regents is made of very 
powerful people. The student 
regent IS the only perspective 
they (the regents) get. They 
Identify him with student 
opi nion ." 

SMART 
OUTGOING 
ASSERTIVE 

The student regent has the 
disadvantages of being a short 
term board member, and of 
being a young person. According 
to Sabo, -If you can make a good 
point and your argumen ts are 
credible, you can convi nce the 
right people, and then you have 
changed university policy." 

When asked about the effects 
of student demonstrations o n 
regent opinion , Sabo maintained 
that student demonstrations are 
an important means of 
expression; but to be an effective 
form of protest, the issue at hand 
lihould effect the umversi[}' 
inside and outside, the students, 
faculty, staff and community. 

Being a student Regent takes a 

lot of time. Sabo traveled at least 
once a week. sometimes even 
three times a week. "To do it 
justice. the job takes 20 to 30 
hours per week. If you like it . It 
is worthwhile . You leam a lot by 
being around those people." 

The regen ts meet once a 
month , two days at a time. The 
meetings usually are held in San 
Francisco or Los Angeles. Every 
third meeting is held o n a UC 
campus. In addition , there are 
campus and laboratory tours, 
committee meetings, publIc 
testimony hearings and lobbying

Student regents have the

Sharing the initiative in contraception 
Continued from page 1 

In the box shown are listed , 
according to effectiveness, the 
most widely used forms of 
contraceptives. There are twO 
Important features of this 
diagram: One, that the most 
effective method IS the pill; and 
twO, that only one of the 
methods is male-oriented.* 
Although evidence shows wider 
usage of the existing male 
methods (in England for 
example, it is reponed that 2.8 
million men use the condom), 

Contraceptive Efficacy 
1. Pill 
2. l.U.D. 
3. Condom'" 
4. Diaphragm 
5. Foam 
6. Rhythm 
7. Douche 

these are not the most effective. 
The pill , a combination of 
esrrogen and progestogen which 
is considered 99 to 100 percent 
effective when taken regularly, is 
exclUSively female-oriented . 
According to Dr. Kristin Luker, 
sociologist at UCSD, the 
decisions which led to the 
development of the pill and the 
consequent burden of 
conrraceptive responsibility 
placed primarily on women are 
due to sociological, not biological 
facrors. Prior to development of 
the pill, most contraceptives were 
used at the nme of intercourse, 
then the focus of research [timed 
to me female. 

In her book Taking Chances , 
Dr. Luker makes the point that 
this decision was based on the 
premise that "only women are 
motivated to contracept because 
only women get pregnant .. " 
This assumption, Luker states, 
confuses value judgment with 
scientific fact She argues that 
biologically, men are 50 percent 
responsible for pregnacy. yet 
sociologically pregnancy is 
considered solely a female 
condition. "The defimtion as to 
who ge!S pregnant - that is, 
who bears the responsibility of a 
pregnancy - is a social product: 
when examined cross-culturally 
there is a wide variation in the 
assessment of responsibilities for 
pregnancy." 
. Thus, Luker holds, based on 
social assumption , contraceptive 
developments were for the most 
pan for female usage. Then. 
since the bulk of research went 
in this direction it was here that 
the greatest progress was made, 
and quite naturaDy the result was 
the most effective non-surgical 
contraceptive to date. Despite 
the other masculine alternatives 
available, the onus of taking 
preemptive measures is now 
placed on the woman. Born of 
social assumption , says Luker, 
the resulting technology now in 
effect make this assumption true. 

AI. this point however, it can 
bt argued that social beliefs are 
... the only reason for the 15 
)'OIr lag in 'male-pill resean::h. 
kmrding to those involved in 
the research, biol~cal factors 

are one reason for -female-
oriented binh control. It is 
generally held that there is more 
available information on the 
female reproductive system than 
on the male . In this respect, it is 
more feasible to develop a female 
contraceptive. 

Yet, whatever the reasons, the 
consequence is that the burden 
of responsibilty for 
contraception, as weD as 
accountability in the event of an 
unwanted pregnancy, is placed 
on the shoulders of the woman. 

As Dr. Luker states, the woman is 
made responsible for the less 
desirable aspect of an activity 
which is enjoyable for both 
panles; or as it has been worded 
by Dr. Frank Lesser: "It seems to 
work bener for the gander than 
for the goose." Furthe/lTlore, says 
Luker. the woman may begin to 
resent having to carry the weight 
of this responsibility alone. tn 
this way some people argue that 
paradoxically women were not 
liberated by the pill, but almost 
the contrary. 

Dr. Drescher Kripke of the 
UCSD Women's Clinic talks 
about the woman's obligatory role 
in temts of "control" as opposed 

to "responsibility." Mistrust and a 
desire for control of the situation 
is how Dr. Kripke describes what 
she sees as the non-resentful 
attitude of women who take the 
initiative for contraception. 

"Most women prefer not to use 
condoms; they don't trust nor 
comrol them. They are correct in 
that it doesn 't have a high 
success rate ." As for the number 
of students who inquire about 
developments in a new male 
method , staff at the clinic claim 
that they do occassionaUy hear 

this type of question, from both 
men and \Women. Yet, Dr. Kripke 
went on to remark that when 
women who inquire about a male 
contraceptive are then asked if 
they would be wiDing to rely on 
this method, the answer is 
invariably negative. They want to 
be cenain and they want to be 
in control of an issue which 
carries the highest risk for them. 
However what if such a 
development were made and the 
mistrust were no longer valid? 
The argument here is that even if 
a technique were perfected, 
would the male have the 
motivation to take this new 
initiative? 

Studies show that men are 
becoming increasingly more 
willing to participate in 
contraception. According to 
Albert and Elizabeth Allegeier's 
book Sexual '"(fraction , a 1983 
study showed that 67 percent of 
a sample of high school males 
claimed to prefer taking the 
responsibility themselves. The 
growing popularity of vasectomy 
is also "testimony to the 
masculine interest in the 
limitation of fl'rtility." It seems 
logical then that a more effective 
form of male contraceptive is in 
demand . What is being done to 
develop such a method? In brief, 
progress towards a male 
equivalent of the piU is slow. 
There are various ideas on how 
such a method could be 
developed - what form it would 
take (for a piu is not the only 
possible answer), but mostly, at 
what stage of the development of 
the spennatazoa, the "agent" 
(product to induce infenility of 
sperm) wouki be introduced. 

One recent development 
mentioned in a 1983 issue of 
Science, news I'IIIJ8Gtine, is that of 
a stOmach salve. Being developed 
at the Johns Hopkins University 
at Baltimore, it is essentially a 
hormonal salve for men which 
suppresses the production of 
sperm. It achieves this by 
"tricking the brain" into Slopping 
production of the honnonr 
necessary for reproduction, 
Fnadorropin. The principle is 
the same as that of the female 

When women who 
inquire about a male 
contraceptive are 
then asked if they 
would be willing to 
rely on this method, 
the answer is 
invariably negative .. , 
they wan t to be in 
control of an issue 
which carries the 
highest risk for them. 

-Dr. Drescher 
Kripke 

oral conrraceptive. 
Unlike most other methods 

being researched, this one wouk 
take the form of a salve which 
would be rubbed into the 
stomach and absorbed into the 
bloodstream. The one difficulty 
involved is in the determination 
of the amount of salve to be used 
and the dubious ability to 
administer exact measures of the 
drug in this form . Otherwise, the 
product shows no sign of side 
effects. According to the scientist 
who is responsible for its 
development larry LEwing, 
"We'(f: ready to try it on 
humans." 

In hiS New Scientist , 'article, 

"Are Men Ready to Share the 
Burden," British doctor Frank 
Lesser mentions that a male pill 
does exist, but it is not being 
used because of the side effects 
it produces, this argument, he 
claims, has been inconsistent 
over the years - and was of less 
significance in determining the 
safety of the female 
contraceptive. 

"The trouble with these 
arguments is that nobody 
regarded them as valid reasons 
- ther (side effects to the male 
pill) aI have female analogues -
for not starting clinical 
experiments in women 28 years 
ago, or for continuing to use the 
pill despite the considerable list 
of side effects so far recognized ," 
said Lesser. 

It would be fair to assume that 
there is a certain degree of truth 
in the "social assumption" 
theory, that there is a strong 
social element influencing the 
development of such a 
conrraceptive for males. Dr 
Ronald Ericsson of Western 
Michigan University states that 
such a development wiD be the 
result of $OCioiogists and 
technologists and not of basic 
scientists. Above aD "society has 
to want the male contraceptive'-

There is evidence accOliiing to 
Dr A. Reyes and Dr. M. 
OIavarrta, contributing authors 
of Regulation oj Malt Fertility,in 
the sean::h for a male 
contraceptive has increased in 
the last decade. This is due to 
six facrors: 1) the growing 
concern over the adverse effects 
of prolonged usage of the pill 
(although it is being discovered 
that there are also positive effects 
from the piu); 2) the high 
number of women discontinuing 
the use of intrauterine devices; 
3)the \ow number of women 
using long term progestogens or 
the morning after pill; i) the 
increasing number of men 
interested in controlling their 
fertiliry; 5) the development of 
knowledge or. the male 
reproductive system; and 6) the 
trend towards sharing 
contraceptive responsibility. 

This last factor is the key. 
Such a trend is indeed a positive 
sign, and a long overdue one. It 
is only biologically and 
psychoiogicaOy natural that the 
responsibility for contraception 
be a shared one. Dr Luker 
provides a formula for attaining 
this: we must •.. . change the 
social definition of contraception 
as an exclUSively female-oriented 
process, where pnly female-
oriented contraceptives are 
considered either effective or 
ratiOnal. .. Examples of 
conrraceptive services for men 
however, are conspicuously 
absent except for the sale and 
advertisement of condoms." She 
goes on to suggest that 
contraception decisions should 
be mutual and that clinics should 
offer sessions for men as weD as 
women.

A glimpse at what's under the gown 
By STACY MARTIN 

It was around two o'clock and 
like any other nonnal day, ( was 
late for class. Naturally, aD 
parking lots were full except for 
the farthest lot at Third coUege 
which happens to be at least one 
mile from any son of civilization. 
( began to psyche myself up for 
my rapid run. ( dashed through 
the parking lots, flew by Muir 
college and ran towards Revelle 
plaza where I accidentaDy 
drorped my notebook, leaving a 
trai of scanered papers. QUickly 
bending down to gather the 
loose papers, a hand reached out 
to me offering help. 

( thanked this person as he 
gathered up my papers and 
handed me a pamphelet along 
with a piece of peanut butter 
fudge wrapped in a baggie. 
Looking at him in dismay. 1 
accepted his offerings and ran to 
class. 

Afterwards I began wondering 

about the incident. What I found 
most strange was his peculiar 
appearance. He had very little 
hair, paint on his face, and was. 
tighdy wrapped in a piece of 
white doth. He wasn't alone, 
however. There were others 
around him that looked similar. 

~ 
chewing the fudge until I could 
taste every ingredient. It 
suddenly dawned on me that ( 
wanted to learn the recipe; I 
wanted to know more about "The 
Hare Krishnas." 

The movement goes back 
5,000 years, originally founded in 
India. but only in the past 20 
years have they been actively 
practicing their philosophies.

regularly held discussion sessions 
on contraceptives. According to 
Dr. Kripke, there are male as well 
as female students who take 
advantage of thi s se rvice, 

All of th e suggestions fo r an 
Increased male role in 
contraception seem reasonable 
yet women will continue to carry 
the burden until the imponance 
of a male-oriented contraceptive 
equivalent IS realized. Accordmg 
to Dr, Luker, the social definition 
of the role of contraception must 
be reformed . 

Dr. B, Lacy at the Universi ty of 
London sums up both the 
problem and the solution: that it 
is imponant to con~ider th~ ,~an 
and the woman as one umt 
which shares the responsibilities 
associated with contraception, 
pregnancy and childbearing: 
"From a practical POInt of VleW, 
this simply entails that 
<::o ntraception should be 
altemately practiced by each 
panner." 

It does nor require too much 
imagination to picture this 
scenario - for six months the 
man takes his pill, the next six 
months, it's the woman's [urn, 
This idea sounds strangely 
brilliant - strange because we 
are not accustomed to such 
perfectly egalitarian t~atment in 
the male-female relationshIp; and 
brilliant, because it's exactly what 
we should be doing, Il:n

values of his environment. After 
joining the Hare Krishnas, Greg 
claims he has found life more 
enjoyable and now seeks more 
depth in his relationships, 
,including those with his family 
in Minnesota. 

Hare Krishnas are funded 
through the donations of 
congregational members, their 
spiritual book industry (the 
largest disnibutors in Eastem 
classics), vegetarian restaurants 
(throughout the United States), 
and an incense factory in Los 
Angeles,

He states, "I have better 
relationships now with my 
parents than I did when [ lived 
with them at home because I 
respect them much more and 
they respcC[ me much more as 
an adult." 

According to Greg, anyone is 
welcome into the movement 
regardless of race, color, status or 
sex, The only thing that matters 
is the individual's love for God 
and his sincerity to the Hare 
Krishnas, In order to become a 
member they require 
approximately six months to a 
year of devotion to the 
movement, However, this does 
not entail shaving one's head, 
wearing a robe, or liVlng in the 
temple; one can merely be a 
congregational member and live 

Hare Knshllas dance 10 a d!lferent drummer at their San Diego retreat. 
At the beginning of Greg's 

transformation , his parents felt 
responsible for his deciSIOn to 
join the Hare Krishnas and 
began doubting IhClf upbringing, 
But as time progressed , Greg 
said, they learned to accept his 
new identity, 

Members of the organization 
are either congregational 
members of fuD-time devotees 
(monks or priests), A full-time 
devotee, Greg, like most people 
not in the movement, has an 
occupation; yet every two weeks 
he does not receive a paycheck. 
His day begins at 3 am and ends 
at 9 pm during which time he 
preaches to aU walks of life 
ranging from those of high 
school age to the elderly. 

Although members are 
financiaDy supponed by the 
movement, Greg claims members 
are pennitted to have private 
possessions. "It's not like a big 
potluck, it's just that we share 
with God ," he explains. The 

a conventional lifestyle in 
accordance to the movement's 
stipulations, These stipulations 
prohibit drinking, gambling and 
sexual relations (unless married), 
Greg notes that the color of the 
robe signifies a Krishna's marital 
status, If the robe is white it 
con notates marriage or 
engagement as opposed to an 
orange robe which represents 
singleness, 

Greg is one of the many who 
shaves his head, wears a robe 
and paints his face, which he 
calls a sign of renunciation, He 
regards this as a clean, simple 
unifonn which denounces any 
attachment to materialism, He 

states, "Being materialistic 
doesn 't mean you have 
possessions; it's how you use 
them, It's your attitude towards 
the proprieter and how and what 
you use them (possessions) for." 
In thIS day and age, he feels that 
these items tend to be overused 
and can take effect on one's 
identIty, 

Not only do the Krishnas have 
an alternative view of material 
goods, but they also regard sex 
primarily in tenns of 
reproduction as opposed to 
pleasure, Not that the Krishnas 
don 't enjoy sex, but there is 
actually no need for it, said Greg, 
They find satisfaction in 
developing religious 
consciousness as well as in other 
activities mcluding yoga, 
chanting prayer and practicing a 
vegetarian diet. 

In San Diego the 60 Krishna 
members range from age two to 
36. The children are brought up 

in the Krishnas' environment 
and study within the school. 
Although it appears their 
experiences may be limited only 
to Krishna lifestyle, Greg claims 
not , He feels that teaching them 
what is healthy versus whai-i ~ 
not, is far better than directly 
subjecting them to unhealthy 
experiences, According to Greg, 
a child "can experience through 
hearing," 

"It's not isolating but 
insulating, Our children, I would 
say, have more exposure'than 
most children, LLke myself, I 
have had more exposure to more 
different types of people than I 
ever would have had if I hadn't 
joined this movement," 

Greg has traveled throughout 
the United States "encouraging 
spiritual life," and says that 
although responses are not 
always positive , people are 
continuously surprised by his 
appearance as well as his 

philosophies, He nores that 
although he never went to 
college, he probably has viSIted 
more colleges in his time than 
he would have ever wanted to 
attend, 

Greg knows communal life is 
difficult, but he believes one of 
the I1)OSt impressive things 
within the movement is that "so 
many people can live together 
with so many different 
backgrounds and so many 
different natures and they can 
actually gel along," Greg 
attributes this to the cultivation 
of higher consciousness, 

Every Friday night on ReveDe 
campus the Krishnas offer a free 
vegetarian dinner. They feel that 
everyone benefits by eating food 
which is offered to God, states 
Greg, Although one might not 
agree with what's under the 
gown one could enjoy their 
cooking, E:J

Putting Men's Soccer on the map 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Sports Editor 

There are games in 
professional sports that can 
IiteraUy put the entire community 
on the map. These ·franchise-
makers" come in the form of a 
game like last year's national 
league championship game five 
that PUt San Otego on the 
baseball map. 

The UCSD Men's Soccer team 
faces La Verne this Wednesday 
at 3:30 on Warren Field in 
probably the biggest game in 
Triton Soccer hlslOry. A real 
franchise-maker. 

"The game itself is no more 
important than any orner," said 
coach Derek Armstrong, "but its 
our presentation of it that will 
dictate a lot of what will happen 
in the furure of this soccer 
program." 

The importance of the game 
stems from the fact that the 
coach of La Verne -Owen 
Wright- i; the chair of the 
regIOnal committee that decides 
where [he NCAA champIOnship 
games are to be hosted '·The 
committee IS made up of four 
chatrs, two In the east and [\1,·0 
out here In the wcst " Armstrong 
explained, "and If we can prove 
to the chair of that commIttee 
that the UCSD campus 
co mmunity can support a top 
notch program it Will really help 
us in our bid to host the 
NCAA's: 

Like most things in UCSD 
soccer, the yardstick IS once 
again Claremont-Mudd. "They've 
hosted [he reglOnals the last few 
years because the fans have 
come OUt en masse for theIr 
games, which has given them a 
big advantage ," said Armstrong, 
"we have to show that we can 
generate the crowd and display 
the facilities to put us in the 

market tor the ChampIOnship 
games." 

Part of the big drive for this 
game has included enlarging the 
field to 114 X 74 which is, 
inCidently, the size of 
Claremont's. "I measured it last 
year dUring the championship 
rounds up In Claremont, and 
that's exactly how big It was. 
Now they can't hold that against 
us," the coach said . Another 
factor is bringing in enough 
bleachers to allow seating for the 
crowd of 1000-2000 the coa h 
feels is necessary to impress the 
coach of La Verne. "We've 
already eclipsed a thousand fans 
at two of our home games this 
year: Armstrong said , "and I'm 
sure we can do it this time. The 
crowd number is so Important 
because the people with the 
money do not want to take risks, 
quite naturally, and they have to 
see that UCSD IS worth the risk." 

The players themselves have 
worn the dual cap of community 
outreach thiS past week too. "The 
lads have done their bIt,"sald the 
coach, "taking care of billboards 
and flyers, making banners and 
contactlng the media, too." 

Incentive for the commltee to 
put the games In UCSD are 
many. First of all, the Tritons 
deserve it. They are 15-0, have 
)'lelded a total of three goals all 
year, and are ranked # 1 In the 
Far West region and #2 in [he 
nation in DiviSIOn Ill. Another 
factor is the weather. "I don't 
think the people in charge want 
a venue where the teams fly back 
east and have to play in rain or 
snow. If they r;;an play OUt here 
they're gOing to get good weather 
for every game ," said Armstrong. 

Incentive for the Tritons 
themselves to get [he host 

Freshman Th,en Nguyen centers the ball. 

position is even )l.reater. Like the 
door to the championship for 
the Tritons goes th rough 
Claremont-Mudd. "Claremont will 
always be the true test of our 
year," said Armstrong, "because 
we are usually the twO best teams 
on the coast in Division Ill. 
We're nm going anywhere 
without going through 
Claremont.'· 

Claremont's Stags are also 
undefeated on the year wim the 
exception of one loss to Cal. 
State Northridge, the #1 ranked 
team in Division II. "T hey're a 
very good squad: said 
Armstrong, "and ever)'lhing we 
do depneds upon what we do in 
the next game against them." 

Indeed , last year the 

Tritons had a dismal shOWing at 
Claremont in the regionals that 
kept them out of the national 
championships. "We're really 
gOing to have to impress the 
committee," added Armstrong, 
"because Claremont is not going 
to give up the home field 
advannge very eaSily." 

The Triton team has had a 
week off to prepare for the La 
Verne game and will have a 
week after it before they travel 
up to Mudd to face the Stags. 
·'We planned the twO week rest 
before the season started ," said 
Armstrong, "and it has helped us 
get healthy. We're knocked up 
pretty good right now and the flu 
has ravaged us too." 

Two of the more serious 

knocks are to starters Paul 
Carlson and SCott Strom mer, who 
are lucky the break came when it 
did. "We're hoping that they'll be 
ready for the game against La 
Verne and I think they will . For 
Paul all we have to do is put a 
band-aid on him and he's ready 
to play," the coach said. 

The Tritons have also played 
more games than any other team 
in Division Ill. "We planned it 
[hat way in order to be ready for 
our big games that come later in 
the season," Armstrong said . 

Armstrong expects his squad 
to be ready this Wednesday and 
hopes that the community is as 
well. The La Verne game will 
probably be a franchise maker or 
breaker. The Tritons and their 
coach hope that UCSD will make 
the former a reality. ~ 

Men 's Soccer coach Dereh Armstrong IS expecting a big crowd for the La Verne game. 

Wotnen's Soccer 
gets their kicks 
By STEPHANIE KAUS 

T HE UCSD women's soccer team had a couple of problems this week. On 
Friday afternoon it was a 
problem that many teams wish 
they had; their game against the 
Pomona Pitzer Sage hens was just 
tOO easy, and didn't give them 
the opportunity to strengthen 
their game. 

As their outgOing coach John 
Leaney shouted instructions from 
the Sidelines. UCSD crushed 
Pomona 7-0 . "We were JUSt too 
strong for them:· explained 
Leaney. ConsiderIng that the 
Sagehens are one of the best 
Division III teams, this was 
certainly no small 
accomplishment. 

The first three goals were 
scored within twenty minutes , 
the first two by outstanding 
juntor Adriene Clark, and the 
third by senior Stacy Simmon. 
Clark has had an extremely 
strong record this season, 
scoring thirteen goals in fifteen 
games 

Leaney credits the Triton's 
commandmg openi ng play to 
their unYielding ball control, and 
a Simple strategy of an aggressive 
offense. Seemg how easily his 

starting players were controlling 
the game, Leaney seized the 
opportunity to let some of his 
younger and less experienced 
team members play. They were 
equall y as consistent in holding 
the Sage hens at bay and the 
score remained 3-0 at halftime. 

Adriene Clark again set the 
pace in [he second half, scoring 
almost immediately. San Diego's 
Lynn Bailey and Rachel King 
contributed with twO goals of 
their own along the way, in 
addition to yet another goal by 
Clark in the tail end of the game. 
Combined with several cruCial 
saves by goalie Enn Aafedt, the 
Tritons confirmed their rule over 
Pomona. 

Earlier this week they faced a 
problem of a different nature as 
they were the ones being 
overcome. The Tritons 
challe nged # 10 ranked 
DomInguez Hills, and In doing 
so came across some tough 
competition and lost 2-1. The 
Toros dominated the opening of 
the game and kept thc pressure 
on , holding the Tritons in their 
own half of the field . Despite the 
valiant efforts of the defense, 
particularly goalie Erin Aafedt 
who made a rremdendous save 

at the foot of the POSt, the Toro's 
scored and thus set the tonc for 
the rest of the first half. The 
Tritons found every move they 
made anticipated by Dominguez 
Hills, and it took everything they 
could muster to stay in the game. 

The second half proved to be 
much more reflective of Triton 
ability, as Adriene Clark led a 
piercing attack on the Toro's 
defense. After a calculated long 
throw by freshman fullbac k 
Susan Kramer, Clark succeeded 
in scoring. She was nearly 
successful on twO other 
opportun it ies, but the 
Dominguez Hills team held their 
lead . Their goalkeeper Sandra 
Powers was especially adept at 
catc hing several of the Triton's 
comer kicks, but UCSD goalie 
Aafedt matched this feat by 
saving a twemy yard rocket. 

Coach Leaney termed 
Tuesday's matc h as "an exciting 
end-to-end encounter that left 
both sides exhausted ." 

Looking ahead, UCSD plays 
Claremom Mudd on Sunday at 3 
pm in Claremont, a match 
Leaney feels very confident 
about. Later this month they will 
face stiff competition when rhey 
take on Cal Poly Pomona, the 
best DiviSion II team , along with 
Long Beach State, UC Irvme , and 
UC Santa Barbara , all three of 
which are in Division III. But 
with Friday's easy victory under 
their belt and Adriene Clark 
leading an aggressive offense, the 
Tritons JUSt might pull off a few 
upsets. iii

Inconsistencies plaguing volleyball 
By TOM FERGUSON 

"There is nothing encouragi ng 
or discouraging except that we're 
Just making rookie mistakes," 
says Doug Dannevik. "We're not 
playmg as well as we should If 
we want Can NCAA berth)." This 
statement by the U SO women's 
volleyball coach came while 
discussing his team's latest 
dIlemma - mconSlstenCles. ThiS 
new Situation arose last weekend 
(October 4 and S) when the 
Tritons faced Elizabethtown CPa.) 
and OCCldem,ll , respectively. 
They defeated both of these 
DIVISiOn III teams to Improve 
their overall record 10-9 and 
continue their undefeated (5-0) 
stand versus Division III schools. 

However, Dannevik claims that 

the scores, 16-14, 15-6, 11-15, 
15-4 agaInst Elizabethtown and 
15-\3, \3-15 , 15-8, 15-5 against 
Oxy "arc indicative that we 're 
stili not consistent and not rcady 
to put anybody away." The 
greatest strength, according to 
Dannevlk, was the serve. The 
Tritons combined for a total of 
16 aces versus Elizabethtown 
With only 6 errors on 64 total 
serves. The team also had a total 
of 49 kills, lO coming from Carol 
Lipson . 8 by Kim Sroneclpher, 
and 7 apiece for MOnIca Bradley 
and DeeDee Bigelow. 
Stonecipher and Bigelow had the 
highest hitting percentage of 
staners (.353 and 384, 
respectively). 

Soph-morc Ellen Chi IS second on the team in service aces. 

In the match against 
Occidenta I, the inconSistencies 
appeared in the form of poor 
individual play. Dannevlk feels 
that the Tritons cannot afford to 
have sub-par performances at 
rhis rime, and said that it was 
confusing that "there was no 
single individual play from 
players mat are usually strong." 
As in the match the preVIous 
day, service proved to be the 
strong point With UCSD serving 
18 aces and commlllmg only 9 
errors on 75 total serves. 
However, three players whose 
hming percentages were 
substantial against Elizabethtown 
a tuaUy had negative figures (-
.076, -.125 and -.350) versus 
Oxy. Mary Pontius led the Triton 
squad with .357 percent and 
Monica Bradley finIshed With lO 
kills. 

The individual slumps 
continued to plague the TrItons 
when they lost on October 8 to 
Biola University, a scholarship 

AlA division team. Dannevik 
said that the players he expects 
to get good performances from 
are not producing them. "We 
played as bad as we could. we 
got crushed." He claimed that 
[hey were never really In the 
match due to a combination of 
mistakes, playing against a bigger 
and stronger team and Biola's 
tremendous fan support. 'The 
girls just wilted ... it was their first 
hostile crowd." The crowd was 
the major factor in the first

game, which UCSD lost 2-15; the 
team never recovered in the 
second , which they lost 8-15; the 
third game was finally even, but 
the Tritons lost 13-15 on two ace 
serves. 

As he has throughout the 
season thus far, Dannevik is 
keeping a positive outlook for 
the rest of the season, and is 
trying to help his girls do the 
same: "There is no reason for us 
to lose like this ... we have to try 
to right the ship and get on the 
right track." 

They were going to play 
in their biggest tournament of 
the year at Colorado College. 
This tournament consists of all 
Division III teams, and boasts 

four of the top 10 schools. The 
Triton squad met St. Mary's of 
the Plains (Iowa), Southern 
Colorado and Central University 
(Iowa) on Friday, October 11 . 
Dannevik feels that they ought to 
be able to make a breakthrough , 
and hopes that they do · We 
seem destined to have to fight 
through this." 

V-Ball Notes: The team is 
currently ranked 12th in the 
nation ... To figure hitting 
perl:entage, subtract the number 
of hitting errors from number of 
kills and divide by the total 
number of hitting attempts ... 
Jennifer PetTigren leads the 
Tritons with .318 hitting, 
followed by Janet Hughes (.296) ... 
team leaders in kills are Carol 
Lipson (153) alld Kim 
Stonecipher (92); team total is 
600 ... Lipson also leads in 
service aces with 54; Ellen Chi is 
second with 33 (team total is 
195). ~

The Playoff Picture 
American League Championship Series 

Only George Brett stood between Toronto and the first 
appearance of a Canadian team in the World Series and 
apparently he wasn't enough. ' 

With the 3-1 victory on Saturday, the Blue Jays from 
Toronto took a commanding 3-1 lead in games in the best 
of seven series and appear destined to meet the NL 
representative Oc!. 19. 

With the Blue Jays on the verge , it becomes evident that 
the reSt of the world may have to finally make themselves 
acquainted with lhe no-name Blue-Jays, who have labored 
in virtual obscurity the last two years despite their second 
and first place fimshes. 

Despite their record . however, the Blue Jays seem to 
suITer from many of the same symptoms of weakness that 
characterize theJunior circuiL With the exception of Dave 
Sueb, lhe Blue Jays lack any real pitching, and are doomed 
to failure once they meet a team - either LA or St. Louis -
with ERA's under 4.00 . 

Even though expansion has been good to Toronto, it 
has wreaked havoc on the rest of the AL, and combined 
with the DH rule, has especially reduced the talent in the 
pitching . departments. How else can one explaIn the 
excrutlatlngly long careers ofNL wash-ups like Don Sutton 
and Tommy John . 

Toronto has their version of this phenomenon in a 
pitcher named DenOls Lamp, whose career with the 
Chicago. Cubs in the Real league was anything but 
distinguished .. In . twO games versus Kansas City, Lamp 
had pitched five Innmgs and not allowed a run . Charlie 
Liebrandt, after getting hammered in the first game , was 
the hard luck loser in the fourth , shutting down Toronto 
on four hits in eight innings. When Liebrandt was 
stinking up the field for the Cincinnatti Reds a few years 
ago, everyone wondered what he was doing in the big 
leagues. So he gOt traded to the AL and won 17 games this 
year. Hmmmmmmmmm. Does the NL really want to 
expand? 
. The. Blue Jays have distinguished themselves, especially 
I~ theIr defense . Jesse Barfield is a superb talent in right 
fIeld and Tony Fernandez and Damaso Garcia have 

I TOYOTA '. H\:iDAVOI.KS 

formed a formidable double play combination. But the real 
star of the series had once again proven to be the Royals 
thIrd basema!1' George Brett. Somebody teach this guy to 
hIt, huh?! As If a.500 batting average in postseason wasn 't 
enough Brett has also showed off his glove in the series. If 
this guy was surrounded by other players, there might be 
none better. 

But since Toronto will be in the World Series,let's [,JCus 
on their chances of winning iLThere will be no DH this 
year. so Toronto will have a disadvantage there. Whether 
they face St. Louis or the Dodgers, they will be 
overmatched on the mound and probably at the plate . You 
never know, the Aussies have the America's Cup , but they 
probably have better pitchIng. too. 

National League Championship Series 
In three of the sloppier games you'll ever see, the boys in 

blue from Lasorda-Iand have eeked out a 2-1 series 
advantage going into Sunday's fourth game . 

The first two games in LA featured the SL Louis Cardinal 
version of Broomball - they were preparing to be swept 
- and a Dodger team that played well enough not to lose. 
When they moved to Busch stadium in SL Louis , however, 
it was the Dodgers who played well enough to lose . 

Game three featured the defense which has made St. 
Louis famous and the Dodgers infamous. The Dodger 0 
brokedown at an unlIkely source as the best defensive 
c~tcher in the game - Mike Sciocia- threw one away and 
pitcher Bob Welch threw another away to give the 
Redbirds a couple of free runs , and Danny Cox and the 
defense took care of the rest while the Cardinal oITense 
continued to sputter away scoring chances. 

But this series features a home field advantage that may 
just save LA because of the new seven game formal. If there 
ever wasa team desi~ned for Astroturf and built for speed, 
It IS Whitey Herzogs Cardinals. With only one real long 
ball threat ~Jack Clark- St. Louis can beat you to death 
on the base paths and in the field . Although Scioscia has 
done a fine job containing Coleman and McGee 
Saturday'S game showed what the threat of speed can do: 
And whenever LA threatened to get back into the game, 

:b., ~"( <<)~~q" 
, 

the Cardinal defense took them right out of it. Terry 
Pendelton In particular shOWing off his what should-be a 
gold glove 

Although the Dodgers beat John Tudor in the first game 
of the series, S[' Louis should have had an advantage 
Sunday against Jerry "Rolls" Reuss. The Dodgers. in 
contrast to St. Louis. are a team built expressly for the 
natural turf. The high grass at Chavez Ravine and shoner 
fences favor the plodding Dodgers and their pitchers. So 
since this is the first year of the four game format , lA is 

basic~lly Sitting ~n the catbird seat. Apparently Dorothy 
was nght , there IS no place like home. 

* * * 

LCS Notes . . . If there was ever a more overrated 
broadcaster than Vin Scully, 1 wouldn't want to meet him. 
Aside from his blatant shilling for the Big Blue cause , 
Scully'S bombaSlic circumlocutious waxing on the fine 
pOints of Fernando's balance on either the third base side 
or first base side of the pitching rubber can only match the 
bubbhng presence of Lawrence Welk for sheer 
excitement. Someone should teU Vinny that its OK to shut 
up for a few minutes here and there .. . Mariano Duncan's 
injured knee pUts the Dodgers at a distinct disadvantage , 
becausc they have to play Anderson at shon and thus lose 
vinually their only speed threat on the team. As good as 
Duncan IS. the comparis?ns coming out of Dodgenown 
concerning other names hke Smith and Templeton should 
not be taken seriously by anyone other than Dodger fans . 
Considering the block of cement that LA has had at shon 
over the past decade, Mariano looks like a godsend .. . 
Base stealing in the series has probably been the point of 
most I.nterest, with the Dodgers actually stealing more 
bases In the first twO games than St. Louis. In fact, the 
Cardinals ran themselves right out of potential big innings 
in the first twO games when Tommy Herr followed three 
unsucccessful stolen base attempts Wilh twO doubles . .. 
The sc'ries will conclude either on Wednesday or 
Thursday in LA. ~
