·Four Win 
Guggenheim 
·Fellowships 

Four UCSD scientists have 
been awarded John Simon 
Memorial Guggenheim 
Fellowships , one of the most 
prestigious research awards in 
the nation. 

John Abelson , Karl 
Hostetler, Dan Lindsley and 
John Wheatley were selected 
for the grants. They are 
among 21 UC professors so 
honored. 

More professors at UC were 
honored than at any other 
university (the next highest 
were Columbia and Harvard 
with 13 each). 

UCLA, with five, was the 
only UC school with more 
Guggenheim winners than 

UCS~. Berkeley also had four 
and Kiverside was alone in 
having no awards to its 
campus staff. 

Abelson, a chemistry 
profeuor, won for a project on 
the mechanism of gene 
expreuion in higher 
organisms. 

Hostetler, an associate 
professor who works with the 
Lipid Research Center, will 
study the biochemistry of lipids 
with his grant. 

Biologist Dan Lindsley was 
accorded the award to study 
chromosome c)'tojenics, and 
physicist John Wheatley will 
study the properties of liquids 
in heat engines. 

Though the foundation 
awards grant. each year in the 
liberal arts and socialeciences,

none were so honored at 
UCSD.

Carter Afghan Policy 
Finally Challenged 

BY JEFF BERESFORD.HOWE 
Ne_ Editor 

Some candidates may 
quibble with the exact form of 
what seems to be policy of 
punishing the Soviets by not 
participating in their athletic 
show, but the basic tenor of the 
president's response to the 
deployment of Soviet troopa in 
Afghanistan has not been a 
major part of any campaign 
debatet. 

There ,is only one party 
that's willing to argue with 
Carter , but they believe the 
Soviets are right, a view not 
likely to win them many 
adherents in conservative San 
Diego.

oppose the legitimate

The USSR was invited into 
Afghanistan, Griswold points 
out, and she dismisses the 
argument that President 
Amin, who allegedly 
opposed the invitation, was 
later assassinated. 

"There are a lot of factions 
in Afghanistan, and Amin was 
just head of one of them. He's 
not in power any more, but 
that doesn't mean the Soviet

Suicide, Homicide, and Drug Abuse 
Rising Among Middle Class Youth 

This is the last in a series of articles on American Youth by 
PNS editor Rasa Gustaitis, which occasional/y appear in 
The Daily Guardian 

BY RASA GUST AITIS 
MILL V ALLEY CA. - When her divorced mother 

moved into her new lover's home, Laura was 15. an age when 
- her mother remembered - a girl likes privacy and a place 
of her own. So a garden shed in the large back yard was 
remodeled into a cabin for her. 

Laura was thrilled, except that as a result, there did not 
seem to be real place for her in the main house anymore. and 
when she came in she felt more the guest than the resident. 

She became one more teenager rendered peripheral to her 
family 's household. Nobody complained when she came in 
late, and nobody noticed when she began to come in drunk. 

The experience of becoming peripheral is part of growing 
up in America today. It may be blamed on the changing 
nature of families . or the shrinking 01 the economy and public 
services - especially schools. But wherever the blame lies, 
the fact is that many young people now feel marginal- and 
that creates casualties. 

"These are the kids we get here," observed Tim 
Garthwaite, deputy probation officer and counselor at Marin 
County's Project Reunite, speaking of adolescents who find 
they no longer have a place in the lives of their parents. 

"The message they get is: 'You can come with me but 
you're not going to disrupt my life.' .. , 

That's chilly news, especially to a teenager whose body is 
exploding chemically and whose mind is in turmoil, trying to 
catch up with changes. But with divorce so common that in 
some communities a youngster who lives with both parents is 
more the exception than the rule, children can no longer take 
home lor granted. . 

Some. like Laura, try to continue on the edge of home, 
others drift between household, or set up separate quarters. 
Still others are left behind bv oarents grown tired of parenting 

and more interested in new vocations and careers. While in 
low income households teenagers might be squeezed out by 
economics, in suburbia many are cast loose by parental 
liberation. 

The abandonment creates turmoil. "We find that, 
increasingly, a kind of irrational anger exists," remarked Ken 
Helms, coordinator of a community school pro~am in Marin 
County, a wealthy suburb of San Francisco. 'Kids who are 
middlyand upper middle clall strike out blindly." 

The "striking out" often leaves disaster in its wake. 
·SUicide is now the second most common cause of death 

among teenagers (ranking aftel" accidents, which are not 
always distinguishable from suicides), and rising. Among 

, white males between 15 and 19, it jumped by 270 percent 
between 1950 and 1977. "Suicidal behavior is very 
prominent among young people," says Dr. Richard Reubin, 
executive director 01 the Marin County Suicide Prevention 
Center. 

·Homicide among 15 to 19·year old white males has also 
increased by 207 percent nationwide between 1959 and 
1977. The combined homicide and suicide casualties 01 
youth total perhaps 10,000 a year. 

·Ulegitimate births among white women between 15 and 
19 have nearly tripled , from 5.1 per 1,000 in 1950 to 13.6 
per 1.000 in 1977. 

• And numerous surveys ha ve recorded dramatic increases 
in teenage drug use. drug dealing and burglary - increases 
which cross all racial and class boundaries. 

"Out children and adolescents are increasingly engaged in 
killing, hurting and abusing themselves and other," says 
Edward A. Wynne. pwfessor of education policy studies at 
the University 01 Illinois Chicago Circle, who analyzed the 
data as measures 01 alienation. "The growing trend toward 
alienation raises the central question of social continuity. I. 
our society rearing adults who can keep the country going?" 

What used to be a syndrome characterizing lower class 
youth now also describes more affluent youth. A report by 
community workers and residents in Marin City, which is 
Marin County's only black ghetto, found "hopelessness, 
anger and boredom, and the most destructive behaviours to 
be palsive - depression, lICapegoating, apathy, withholding 
(of communication, information, affection, etc.) suspicion 
and substance abuse." 

Drinking, other drug use and sex begin earlier. "Eighty 
percent are sexually active by the time they are juniors and 
seniors," ,aid Lucy Van Hise, the Tamalpais High School 
nurse. "'llley are starting at 11. or 12. And unfortunately, 
sex education starts later. Some kids about 14 are coming 
in about their third abortion." 

For mOltltudents in this liberal communi~, "abortion il 
allumed (as a "-ht), as is homosexuality,' according to 
teacher Roger Falge. 

Experimentation with drugs happens mostly in junior high 
school, according to dean of student. Ted Mitchell. 
Marijuana i. prevalent on campul, . Getting caught with it can 
mean a day's suspension but that "doeln't help much," he 
said. Vodka is sneaked in mixed with juice or 10ft drink •.

Soviets Need More 
Troops in SW Asia 

WASHINGTON - De· 
puty Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said 
yesterday that Soviet generals 
in Afghanistan are asking lor 
still more troops because of 
difficulties encountered there, 
even though the Soviets 
already have more than 
100,000 men stationed in the 
Southwest Asian nation. 

"The Soviet Union is having 
a great deal of difficulty in 
Afghanistan," Christopher 
said in a nationally broadcast 
interview. 

"Their generals are asking 
for more troops. They are 
having a great deal of difficulty 
with the Afghan army. 
'llley're pouring in additional 
troops. It's now well over 
100,000, probably over 
110,000 men ... ," he said. 

Christopher's figures 
exceeded previous US 
estimates of Soviet troops 
strength in Afghanistan since 
the Soviets stormed into the 
country in late December. 

'llle State Department had 
previously put the number of 
Soviet troops at between 
80,000 and 85,000 with 
another 20.000 to 30.000

Christopher made his 
remarks on ABC·TV's Issues 
and Answers. 

In another interview, Sen. 
Frank Church, D·ldaho, 
chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, 
said he believes that 
ultimately, the hostages will be 
freed and that negotiation is 
the only way to get this done. 

"Our purpose from the 
beginning was to get them 
home safely and we've known 
from the beginning that there 
was no way that we ourselves 
could rescue them through any 
kind of military operation," he 
said. 

"That has forced the 
president to negotiate for their 
release. It's been very 
frultrating. But it is the only 
policy I know that has a 
chance for success." 

Church said he would give 
Carter "the benefit of the 
doubt" on whether he has been 
a tough negotiator. 

The senator appeared on 
CBS·TV's Face the Nation. 

UN Troops On 
Alert in Lebanon 

TEL AVIV, Ilrael - UN 
peacekeeping troops went on 
full alert in southern Lebanon 
yesterday after a bloody clash 
with Christian militiamen in a 
disputed village and a 
"savage" bombardment of 
UN headquarters, UN officials 
reported. 

Israel declared it had 
withdrawn the last of its 
soldiers from southern 
Lebanon. A spokesman for 
the military command said, 
"The lorces have completed 
their tasks and have left the 

area of IOUth Lebanon." 
The troops, estimated by 

UN spokesmen to total about 
350, first entered Wednesday 
in retaliation for a Palestinian 
guerrilla attack on an Israeli 
border settlement in which 
three Israelis and five raiders 
were killed. 

Peru Embassy

MEXICO CITY - About 
3,000 of the Cubans packing

The Cuban dispatch,

'The group's efforts have yet to 
show at the San Diego County 
Registrar of Voters that adds 
up individual party affiliation 
weekly. Since la.t year, there 
has been little change in the 
percentage of Democrats and 
Republican. among campus

change, since the group has 
begun campaigning in the

become a major part of hi. Ii/e.

Republican or having to argue

their minds they'll re-register, " 
he said. 

The campus organiZatio~

pressure from the San Diego 
County for Anderson workers 
to campaign city wide for 
Anderson. "Though our 
general goals are the same, 
there is conOict of goals

Winners Lonely in Men's Tennis 
BY BARBARA HAAS 

Senior Staff Writer 
The men's tennis team 

dropped a pair of away 
matches this weekend, 
lowering their season record to 
9-15. On Friday they lost to 
Claremont· Harvey Mudd , 8· 

I , and then fell to Redl ands on 
Saturday by the same score. 

Redlands has long been a 
rival of the Tritons. John 
Rosenberg, the established 
second seed in the roster, 
provided the only highlight of 
the dismal loss. He took his 

Triton Poloists Lose 
12-6 to USC, CSF 

The women's water polo 
team suffered two losses in its 
opening season last week, with 
a 12-6 loss to USC on 
Thursday, and another 12·6 
loss to Cal State F u1terton the 
following day. 

UCSD's Lori Miller had a 
prolific Thursday afternoon 
scoring three of UCSD's six 
goals. Claudia O'Brian was 
close behind with two, and 
Ann Becker scored the 
remaining goal. 

UCSD's chances didn't look 
too grim at the end of the first 
period, when USC lead by 
only 2-1 . But USC had an 
explosive second period. 

Opening the period with a goal 
in the initial seconds, USC 
went on to score almost at will 
throughout the period. Despite 
a final, vain goal attempt by 
UCSD 's Natalie Pierce , 
UCSD faced a halftime deficit 
of 7-1. 

UCSD came out of the 
halftime break fighting. They 
out-scored USC 3-2 on three 
goals late in the third period, 
two of which were penalty 
shots . This was UCSD's best 
period for teamwork as well as 
scoring. At the end of the third 
period, the scoreboard showed 
USC ahead 9-4.

It's time to start thinking 

about Mother's Doy (hint:, hint) ... 

contest to three sets before 
winning 4·6, 6·3, 6·2, giving 
UCSD its only win in the 
match. 

"John played really well in 
both matches," teammate . 

The Daily' Guardian 

Sports 
Everett Gee said of him. " He 
played about the best of all of 
u. - he'. been doing real 
good lately." 

The team went into the 
Redlands match tired and let 
down after a disappointing 8-1 
loss to Harvey-Mudd. They 
had narrowly lost to 
Claremont earlier in the 

CSB Whips 
Tritons 7-2 

The Triton women's tennis 
team dropped a league match 
Saturday to We.tmont 
College of Santa Barbara, 7-
2. This loss brings their league 
record to an even 5 wins and 5 
losses.

season, and prematch 
predictions ran in favor of a 
Triton victory. 

" After losing to them 
earlier, we might be able to flull 
this one off," Tad Yamaguchi, 
Triton coach, had said prior to 
the match. 

Rosenberg again came 
' through, this time teaming up 
with top seeded Paul Metsch in 
doubles . They captured the 
only UCSD win, with the 
match again forced to three 
sets before the final victory. 

On arriving at the college, 
the team was greeted by 55 
mph winds and a nearby fire , 
and they didn't really believe 
that they were going to play 
under such conditions. The 
team's spirit was down after 
realizing that the match wasn't 
going to called off or 
postponed until the weather 
cleared. 

The team'. next match i. 
Wednesday at United States 
International University. 
USIU isn' t known as a 
competitive tennis team, so the 
Tritons should be able to clean 
up an easy victory, much

La Verne Holds On to 1 0-7 Softball Win 
Leading 10-1 Half Way Through 6th, 
Visiting Women Outlast Tritons Rally 

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
Despite the superlative play 

of Ihortstop Bonnie Betz and a 
sixth inning rally, the UCSD 
women's softball team fell 10· 
7 to La Verne College at home 
lut friday. 

La Verne started off the 
game with two runs on four 
bate hits, including a one·run 
triple. By the top of the second 
inning, though, UCSD had 
tightened up their defense and 

retired the side in order. In the 
bottom of the inning, the 
Tritons went without any base 
hits , but left one player on due 
to a base on balls. 

UCSD's defense broke 
down again in the third as La 
Verne scored three runs and 
jumped oul to a 5·0 lead. 
Putting an end to the long 
inning, Betz snagged a high 
line drive for the final out.

double play when Betz picked 
up a grounder and fired to first 
baseman Karen Wintner , who 
threw to second, but not in 
time. In the bottom of the fifth , 
UCSD went down in order. 

After five innings of fairly 
even play , the game's pace 
exploded in the sixth . La 
Verne opened the inning with a 
grounder to Betz , who 
promptly made the out. Then 
the visitors came up with five 
base hits despite good pitching 
by Weinsoff , and came away 
with three runs to make 
UCSD's outlook bleak . At the 
bottom of the sixth, La Verne 
led 10· 1. 

The Tritons peaked in the 
sixth with a barrage of base 
hits and stolen bases. They 
were alert and ready, and 
UCSD capitalized on every La 
Verne mistake . About 
midway through the inning, La 
Verne called a meeting on the 
mound in an effort to stave off 
the Triton onslaught, but the 
Tritons kept coming. 

They ran through their 
entire batting. order and came 
up with six runs on six basehits 
to make the score 10· 7 going 
into the seventh and final 
inning. 

Still hyped up from the 
previous inning, the Tritons 
forced three quick outs on La 
Verne. UCSD needed to score 
four runs to win and three to tie 
and push the game into extra 
innings. 

The first base hit came from 
Triton catcher Paula Weddel , 
who went on to steal second, 
then third.

batting an eye, impenetrable 
as ever. He pondered a 
moment, then said quietly and 
clearly, "I wouldn't exist." The 
question, "What would you 
like to be if you were a 
woman?" His answer shows 
him to be in a different class 
from his so·called peers in the 
world of rock music , poseurs 
like . Lou Reed, David Bowie 
and a host of relative 
unknowns, for he has no desire 
to feed himself on an

artistic medium to present 
these views in a forceful, 
dynamic way, without 
pretension. Men of any 
conviction at all are a 
rarity in rock, and Cale's show 
last week at the Catamaran 
proved again that he is what he 
says; what a refreshing 
anomaly. 

The bulk of Cale's show is 
the same as it was in June '79, 
when he recorded his 
Sabotage Live (IRS) album at 
New York 's CBGB. He 
opened both sets with a 
~angent cover of Rufus 
ThomBl' "Walkin' the Dog," 
adding punch to the backbeat 
by. plaring belli~erent bass 
guitar. Then he picked up hiS 
guitar synthesizer and kicked 
the band through "Mercena· 
ries (Ready for War)," a two· 
chord ditty that pretty well 
sums up current attitudes 
toward the military among the 
ambitioUi super· brats of 1980 
(and 1515). 

After lilting down to the 
piano and .tossing off two 
remarkably poppy tunes from 
the Sabotage album, he picked 
up the viola to play 

time, but Cale showed his 
talent for building suspense 
and interest. The next two 
songs pierced right to the heart 
of the present, new 
comr,ositions called "Magic in 
Lies ' and, if I'm not mistaken, 
"Fucking the Neighbor's 
Wife." The former song gives 
voice to everybody's secret 
fears about rock and art in 
general, and the latter, well, 
the title explains it all . 
"fucking" was straight roll, 
and paved the way for the 
climactic last part of the set,

Film/Lynette Tom 

'Changling' Spirit Mysterious, Not Scary 

Georae c. ScoH and Triah Van Devere in the mysterious 'The Chulalina.' 

Dance/Jill Louise Bazeley 

The Changeling isn 't a 
particularly scary film, but 
what it lacks in terror, it makes 
up for by providing a 
lightweight mystery that 
dabbles into the supernatural. 

John Russell is a prominent 
composer whose Me hits a low 
note when a freak car accident 
kills .his wife and daughter . 
The memories force him to 
move from New York to ' 
Seattle. There, with a 
lecturer's position at his 
college alma mater, a 
residence in a Victorian 
mansion, and the company of 
Historical Society worker 
Claire Norman, he hopes to 
begin anew. 

Instead, Russell awakes to 
the sound of incessant banging 
at 6 am, rewrites the tune of a 
music box lullaby , and 
receives a message of help 
from the spirit of a young boy 
who died in the house in 1909. 

Such events lead John and 
Claire to an investillation that 

uncovers a 70 -year-old 
murder and a change of 
identity, both of which point to 
one person: SenatorJoe 
Carmichael , a veteran political 
figure whose family lived in the 
mansion at the time of the 
boy's death . 

The script by William Gray 
and Diana Maddox plays 
down the current tendency of 
horror and occult films, which 
go for the low budget thrills of 
The Legacy or the graphic 
visual effects of Dawn of the 
Dead. Peter Medak's 
direction shares this quality . 
The lighting effects and dolly 
shots by director of 
photography John Coquillion 
highlight the interior and 
exterior sets of production 
designer Trevor Williams' 

. mansion. The music by Rick 
Wilkins is typical haunted 
house thematics. 

The Changeling is 
currently showing at the La 
Jolla Village Square Theaters.

and eventually , he became a college

He' •• dancer. 

Sometimes called "America', fine,t athlete," 
dancer Edward Villella will be at UCSD this 

. week to drum up support for ballet a. a popular 
art form. He should be familiar to many people 
as the narrator of the PBS programs "live from 
Lincoln Center" and "Choreography by 
BaJandline." 

Villella feels that emphaaizing the athletic 
aapeds of dance is a good way to break down 
the ~neral public's "ballet barrier." According 
to The Jock, "aasociating ballet with athletics 
has helped take the tarnilh off the stereotype of 
the overpoetic male dancer. At one time 

Feet in the sand make footprints . 
Feet in Birkenstock do the very 
same thing. 

mothera were concerned about their sons who 
wanted to dance. Now they're more concerned 
about their daughters.'" (Tit for tat , fellow 
jockettea.) 

Villella will give a unique and very personal 
presentation this Thursday evening at 8 in the 
Mandeville auditorium. Hi. lecture/dance 
demonstration will include a 20-minute film clip 
from hi. award-winning CBS special "Dance of 
the Athletes," a lecture dealing with the state of 
ballet, a perspective on his own career and 
experiences with the New York City BaIlet, plul

Too Many 
Doctors? 

WASHINGTON - The 
number of physicians in the 
United States is growing at 
such a rapid rate that the 
nation may have more doctor. 
by 1990 than it needs, a newly 
released government report 
a5Serted yesterday. 

In a report to Prelident 
Carter and Consress, the 
Department of Health and 
Welfare predicted that 
physician requirements for the 
century's final decade will 
ranged between 553,000 and 
596,000. But the report .aid 
the IUPply of doctOR il 
expected to be in the range of 
600,000.

Pushing Kids to the Edge 
Continued from po~ 2 
"Baaed on the amount of drinking I see I think we are going to 
have a whole generation 01 alcoholics in ten years or so. Kids 
are Itarting so much younger." 

Alcohol il the number one drug of use and abuse 
nationwide among young people. Some parents tend to be 
tolerant of drinking, reasoning, "Thank God he's not on 
dope," said Van Hise. 

Again, the trend is nationwide and cuts across income 
groupli. Youth counselor Nel Bly previously worked with low-
income youth in Oakland. The big difference, she said, is that 
"there I didn't hear of kids getting drunk on Grand Marnier or 
Courvoisier. " 

Bly sees the drinking as linked to pressures that compel 
teenagers to grow up faster, to the general loosening of social 
structures, and "much more of a trend for isolation in 
general," among youth. 

"A lot of kids feel real chaotic in adolescence and they 
reach out for limits, " she said. "The lack of stru lures now 
contributes to the chaos. Fast stimuli - TV, disco - sugge t 
that everything should move fast. But development happens 
more slowly. Decisions - that's a process - don't come 

''EtIw.,tl 

quickly. Alcohol makes them seem to happen more quickly. 
A couple of beers fve a facade of closenesl. But the net effect 
is more isolation.' 

Rendered peripheral at horne, unable to find more than 
musory closeness and intimacy through alcohol-blurry 
encounters, many youn~ people also find that other structures 
now offer less support. Tax cuts have hit education and other 
youth services hardest. And as budgets are trimmed to the 
bone, music programs, field trips and other popular programs 
are cancelled, young people get the message: their interests 

, don't count for much. 
Their isolation is aggravated by the reluctance of relatively 

affluent communities to confront the fact that their young 
people are in trouble. "Middle class areas are secretive," said 
community worker Ken Helms. "In a lower income area you 
will hear directly: 'My kid smokes dope. What can I do?' But 
at the point the problem hits the upper middle class it becomes 
defined as 'a social problem.' " 

Authorities in schools, and even the police , tend to look the 
other way when possible in Marin . 

"Kids can disappear ," remarked a county mental h alth 
worker.
