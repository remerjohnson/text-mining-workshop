IRKUTSK, Russia - Thirteen 
months ago, a young man from

north side appeared at the govern-
ment railroad workers' hospital 
complaining of a head wound suf-
fered in a family fight. A blood

the least of his problems: He was 
also infected with Hrv, the virus 
that causes AIDS. 

That was unusual. In the entire

LOS ANGELES - The end of 
legalized gambling on amateur 
sports may be near, as the U.S. 
Senate Commerce Committee 
approved the Amateur Sports 
Integrity Act last Thursday. The 
bill will now go to the Senate 
chamber for a full vote sometime 
in the next few weeks. 

The Amateur Sports Integrity 
Act is just one of several bills intro-
duced into both the U.S. House and 
Senate this year that aim to close a 
loop-hole in the Professional and 
Amateur Sports Act.

A.S. Council 
Questions 
Executive Trip 
Four councilmembers spent 
$5,400 to attend conference 
in New Yark City 

Iy MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

In the wake of A.S. President Tesh 
Khullar's admission that he forged re eipts 
in connection to a trip (0 'cw York, new 
questions have arisen regarding whether he 
and other executive council members 
should have taken the trip in the first place. 

The executive counCil - comprised of 
Khullar, Vice President Internal Jennifer 
Lee, Vice President External Terrence 
Patterson and Vice President Finance Ene 
Rovner - spent approximately $5,400 in 
student funds in order to attend the Annual 
Association of College Unions International 
Conference. 

Some A.S. Council members have ques-
tioned whether the necessity of attending 
the conference. 

"I don't really think that the [executives[ 
had any reason to attend the conference." 
said Warren Senior Senator Kevin 
McGinnis. "I still haven't heafd an adequate 
reason as to why they all needed to be there 
and, frankly, I think that that is because 
there is no good reason." 

McGinnis added those involved may be 
removed from office. 

"If they don't resign, I expect that they 
will be asked to do so, or impeached ." he 
said. "Either way, I think they will at least 
have to pay back whatever money is unac-
counted for."

warranted and that the knowledge the exec-
utives gained is important for the future.

Daily Jolt Faces Problems Upon UCSD Debut 
University said student-run Mb site has no right to use campus' name in its Internet address 
IJJANlIUM 
Staff Writer 

UCSD is the first UC campus 
to join The Daily Jolt, a student-
run online network of over 35 col-
leges: 

The Daily Jolt site devoted to 
UCSD is an interactive one-stop 
Web source aided to completion 
by Marshall sophomore Shirley 
Chow, Roosevelt junior Cindy 
Feng and Warren juniors Sandy 
Tsau and Chester Ng. 

However, The Daily Jolt at 
UCSD is also the first and only 
Daily Jolt site to face administra-
tive problems with a university 
regarding a site. Due to the univer-

sity's naming rights policy, The 
Daily Jolt site dedicated to UCSD 
is now the only Daily Jolt site that 
does not have its university name 
in the URL. 

"The university threatened us 
with criminal charges and forced 
us to remove the word 'UCSD' 
[from] our original Web address, 
www.ucsd.dailyjolt.com." said Chow, 
founder and chairperson of The 
Daily Jolt at UCSD. "They also 
asked us to make it very clear that 
the list of [links to UCSD Web 
sites] were not created by us." 

UCSD Campus Counsel Ann 
Parode said The Daily Jolt has no 
legal right to use UCSD's name in 
its Web address. 

"Daily jolt. com has been re-
quested by the university to not 
employ the university'S name, trade-
marks, logos or acronyms in con-
nection with not only the dai-
Iyjolt.com site but also its domain 
name." Parode said. "Under the 
education code, these are valuable 
property rights belonging to the 
University of California, ~e unau-
thorized use of which is actually a 
misdemeanor. n 

The conflict was resolved by 
changing the word "UCSDn in the 
original address to "Tritons: 
changing the URL to 
www.tritons.dailyjolt.com. 

A disclaimer was added to the 
Web site, specifying The Daily 

Jolt's nonaffiliation with the uni-
versity while a note above the links 
to UCSD Web sites explains that 
"the resources below were not cre-
ated by The Daily Jolt." 

Chow said she is dissatisfied 
with the outcome. 

"We feel the changes [the uni-
versityf asked of us were not nec-
essary, but we did make the 
changes only to appease them and 
avoid any further conflicts," Chow 
said . "Thirty-six other schools 
across the nation have Daily Jolt 
sites and have yet to run into 
something like this. It has never 
been the intention of The Daily

Trip: 
KhuZlar said all executives 
should not have attended 
ContInued from _e 1 
to learn more about the operations of 
UCSD's University Centers Advisory 
Board. 

After anending the conference, 
Khullar said he feels UCAB should 
become part of the A.S Council to 
ensure that UCAB remains account-
able to students. He said he will 
include this and other recommenda-
tions in a repon to President-elect 
Doc Khaleghi. 

Patterson said that while he found 
the conference interesting and valu-
able, he did not know whether it was 
necessary for all four executives to 
attend. 

"In the aftermath of everything, 
was that the best possible confer-
ence? Probably not; Patterson said. 

Patterson added that he did not 
want to revisit past decisions but 
thinks that future A.S. Council mem-
bers could learn from this experience. 

"The way conferences are funded, 
the way trips to conferences are 
authorized needs to change: he said. 

Khullar said he feels only two or 
three of the executives should have 
attended the conference. 

"In retrospect, I guess maybe we 
shouldn't have sent all four execu-
tives: he said. 

McGinnis said all the blame in this 
issue has unfairly and unjustly fallen 
on Khullar's shoulders. 

"I was upset because I feel like 
Tesh is the only person that this is 
being focused on; McGinnis said. 
"He says that he submitted the false 
receipts, but they were all a pan of it. 
I don't want him to be the only one 
who takes the fall if they were all 
responsible: 

Vice President Internal Jennifer 
Lee declined to comment on the mat-
ter, and Vice President Finance Eric 
Rovner was unavailable for comment. 

McGinnis said there are other 
people involved in (his situation who 
have refused to bring forth informa-
tion at this time. 

"What angers me even more is 
that there are people who know more 
than they are saying and they aren't 
really coming fonh." McGinnis said. 
"Administrators knew about it and 
probably would never say anything 
about it except for the fact that we 
students have taken notice." 

Khullar and Patterson said they 
did not attend approximately half of 
the sessions at the conference 
because they were not relevant to stu-
dents. Patterson said these confer-
ences mainly dealt with administra-
tive issues that would be more rele-
vant to UCAB than to the A.S. 
Council. 

Khullar said that although he and 
the other executives did not attend 
many of the sessions, they spent most 
of their spare time meeting with other 
student leaders. 

"We were pretty busy, but there 
was some free time: he said. 

He added that the conference 
schedule allowed the executives to 
have nights free. 

Khullar said that on one of these 
nights, he and the other executives 
treated another student and an advi-
sor to dinner using UCSD student 
funds. 

He said the experience was valu-
able and that he and the other execu-
tives were able to learn how student 
government operates at New York 
University. 

A large portion of the funds spent 
on the trip went to the executives' one 
hotel room, the Marriott in Times 
Square, which Khullar said cost $350 
a night. Khullar said the executives 
stayed at the hotel because it was 
where the con ference was being held. 

"If A.S. Council lmembersl went to 
the conference, ItheYI would have 
known that we had to stay at this 
hotel: he said. "Because meetings 
were staning at different times and on 
all floors, we had to be there all the 
time:

"cholas Runco/ GuardIan 

The recent ruling of a San Diego judge questions where the fine line between art and pornography lies 
I, CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Staff Writer 

Ever since art has existed, there have been 
people who have been offended by certain 
manifestations of it . Perhaps the reason 
there have been so few discoveries of cave . 
paintings is because Neanderthal govern-
ments censored them. 

San Diego Judge William Kennedy 
recently ruled that two San Diego library 
books - "States of Grace" by Graham 
Oven den and "Twenty-five Years of an 
Artist" by David Hamilton - are child 
pornography and should be removed from 
the library. 

If readers want to view the second book 
on their own, they can check it out at 
UCSD's Geisel Library. However, don't let 
the media hype make you rush over there at 
once; not all the pictures in the book are of 
little girls, let alone naked girls. Hamilton is 
an impressionistic photographer whose sub-
jects, in addition to girls (both clothed and 
nude), include landscapes and still-lifes. 

Similarly, the books Ovenden writes and 
edits trace the history of ero tic photography 
of nude girls. Erotic photography was highly 

popular in the Victorian age. One of the 
photographers of the time was Charles 
Dodgson, who wrote the "Alice in 
Wonderland" books under the pen name 
Lewis Carroll. 

Human nature tends to see things where 
we imagine them to be. People have imag-
ined that they are seeing the word "sex" writ-
ten in steam in advertisements and seeing 
images of Mother Theresa in cinnamon 
rolls. Since before written history, there has 
been a man, rabbit or other familiar creature, 
in the moon . 

I am not saying there are no naked girls in 
these books. There are plenty of them. 
However that does not mean they are porno-
graphic. . . 

The David Hamjlton Archives Web site, 
www.hamilton-archives.com. contains a rele-
vant quotation from Hamilton: "A distinc-
tion must be made between eroticism and 
pornography; the media have blurred the 
disparity to an unforgivable degree." 

The distinction can, in many cases, be a 
subtle one, but the intent of the artist, if he 
is a good one, speaks through his an. 
Hamilton and Ovenden did not intend for 
people to read their books in the same way 

they may read Playboy, for iastance. The pur-
pose of the photographs, in both cases, is to 
make people realize the beauty of innocence 
and sometimes the latent sexuality in young 
girls. 

If our culture didn 't have such a taboo on 
nudity, there would not be a problem with 
these books. The commc;rcial for the soap 
Lever 2000 has naked babies in it. Most do 
not consider this pornography, nor do they 
feel the advertisements should be taken off 
the air. 

Hamilton and Ovenden's books did not 
cause pedophile Charles Davis, whose con-
viction of possessing real child pornography

Science Cannot Verify the Truth of the Bible 
Historical accuraty does not necessariry vindicate the book's theology 
Staff Writer 

Some argue that modern histor-
ical analysis is uncovering more 
and more validations to the claims 
in the Bible. 

It would logically follow, there-
fore, that there arc serious inde-
pendent reasons to believe that 
what the Bible says is true. This 
underlying thesis is incorrect on 
several important points. 

The first met',odological mis-
take of the thesis is mat those who 
don't place full faith in the Bible 
believes that everything the Bible 
says is false. I do not think anybody 
could hold such a position - for 
that matter, I do not think anybody 
ever has made such an accusation. 

The Bible was written over a 
period of severa1 centuries by a 
population immersed in a compli-
cated political and cultural history, 
in a very active part of the world. It 
is only natural that important 
events of the day (or historical 
knowledge of previous ages) perco-
lated into the book. 

As an c:umple, I do not sec why 
anybody would doubt the exis-
tence of. Pontius Pilatus. Rome, in 
the first century A.D. (when the 
New Testament was probably writ-
ten), had a very well-organized sys-
tem of public records and, even if 
the primary sources had not com-
municated the name of the prose-
Cutor, the writers of the Gospels 
would have had an easy time find-
ing . it out. It was not yet the 
Internet, but it still maintained 
public records. 

As to the internal harmony of 
the Bible, the people who wrote it 
did so incrementally, not indepen-
dently of one another - a proce-
dure that favored internal coher-

encc. It is also worth mentioning can be found in the methodology 
that the Christian Bible has been and the epistemology of the social

Cell Phone Usage 
Plagues Society 
From c1assroorrzs to freeways, no place in 
California is free of discourteous cellular users 
If UVlN SliD 
Staff Writer 

A significant number of 
UCSD students are quite rude 
and obnoxious. They seem to be 
everywhere, from RIMAC to the 
Price Center, even at the library. 
You can always tell who they are 
from the distinguishing feature 
- the cellular telephone. 

The cell phone is by far the 
most annoying and irritating 
invention ever created. Has one 
of your classes ever been inter-
rupted by the beeping of a cell 
phone? Who hasn't sat next to 
someone who constantly calls 
her friend in order to give up-to-
the- minute updates on what 
she 's doing? Everyone has been 
followed to class by a student 
yakking away on her cell phone. 
It is no doubt that these devices 
present a major nuisance 

If the sounds of the loud 
beeping do not piss you off, then 

. the ensuing one-sided public 
conversations surely should . 
Cell phone users are irritating 
because they constantly engage 
in interesting and thoughtful 
public exchanges with inanimate 
objects. There are not many 
people I know who find th is 
activity tolerable. Most people 
get irritated whenevl!r ( say just 
one simple phrase to my cute, 
yellow, stuffed, puppy dog toy. 

Phone conversations should 
be private, yet when people use 
their cell phones, they announce 
to everyone what is on their 

PICK UP 

mind, no matter how secret or 
even how ridiculous it is. 

I do not want to hear people 
complain to their friends over 
the phone about the negative 
characteristics of their room -
mates. Gossip about cute guy or 
girl one has a crush on should 
not be announced publicly -
and nobody wants to follow 
someone who loudly gives a 
play-by-play account of his or 
her hike from Price Center to 
York Hall. 

The most significant problem 
with cell phones is that many 
users will use them no matter 
where they are. These people 
are extremely obnoxious and 
have even less consideration for 
the people around them or the 
environment they are in. 

Many pull out their phones 
in class or while watching a 
school play or concert. I have 
even had the nasty experknce of 
studying next to a $,uy using his 
cell phone in the library during 
finals week. 

It is one th ing to leave a brief 
message or take care of an emer-
gency through a cell phone con-
versation. It is quite another 
thing to have a conversation at 
the library. 

The problem with cell 
phones is not confined to 
UCSD. It is a nationwide epi-
demic. According to the Cellular 
Carriers Association , more than 
90 million cell phones are in use

The Eternal Search for Stress Relief Leads to Meditation 
Beginning r,'rzsses at RIMAC allow UCSD students from all fields to find time for a little bit of inner peace in their hectic lives 
By DlVYA RUNCHAl 
Columnist 

Few things in life are free, with 
the exceptions of anger and humil-
iation. Not only are these free of 
charge, but all human beings are 
unfortunate enough to receive 
plenty of these emotions several 
times in their lives. I am lucky 
enough to have been blessed with 
an unusual talent that allows me to 
cope with these daily stresses: 
inflating my nostrils. 

I have heard that many people 
possess this talent and I have wit-
nessed several people actually 
expanding their nostrils and 
breathing in deeply by sheer will . It 
seem~ a supernatural phenomena, 
but I have even seen dogs do i!. 

All of this may sound strange to 
the average reader, but those who 
have tried inflating their nostrils 
know that while it may seem a 
bizarre ritual, it lets off steam quite 
well. 

However, after a series of events 
in which my mqther was quite dis-
gusted with my talent, she suggest-
ed I take a meditation class as an 
alternative method of releasing my 
pent-up hostility (of which I have a 

lot) and other malevolent feelings. 
: .Ithough it seemed strange and 

sounded quite New Age, I decided 
to try it out. After scanning the var-
ious classes offered at RIMAC -
kick boxing, salsa dancing. etc. - I 
finally found it nestled in the back 
pages of the recreation magazine. 
In bold-faced letters were the 
words "Intra to Meditation: 

Thank God, I thought. A begin-
ning class for people like me who 
need a better way to cope with angst 
than inflating spare body parts. 

As the first day of the class 
quickly approached, I was para-
lyzed by the notion that I would 
share my floor mat with a yuppie 
eating vanilla yogurt sprink.led with 
granola who listened to Yanni while 
contemplating the meaning of his 
or her IKEA-infested life. Yet, I was 
calmly assuaged by the fact that 
even if I did have to share a mat 
with one of these individuals, I also 
had a secret weapon in combating 
my dismay: I could inflate my nos-
trils and combine this with the 
powers of meditation . 

lhJdging up the RIMAC moun-
tain (by the way, has anyone ever 
thought of having a toll-booth

into medical school. 
tainly pay), I was overcome with 
ambivalent feelings about the 
whole affair. 

Doesn't it say something about 
my state of mind when I have to go 
to a class to be taught how to release 
my anxiety and cahn my fears? 
Embarrassed as I was. I decided 
there would be no turning back, as I 
had just walked all the way up the 
hill and was not ready to walk all the 
way down as well. I finally entered 
the class and was surprised it was so 
full . Could there really be so many 
people at UCSD who were having as 
much trouble as me organizing their 
60,OOO-plus thoughts a day? (We 
learned this great conversational fact 
in claSs.) Apparently so. 

There were graduate students, 
individuals in their 50s and some 

in their teens. I was frightened by 
the fact that there were so many 
adults because I worried that if I 
didn't get my stress handled now, I 
would still be grappling with it in 
the future. 

While the teacher who looked 
radiant beyond her years certainly 
exemplified my dream of a medita-
tion gUide - kind, 'lIm and with 
an ethereal glow about her - I was 
a bit afraid to disappoint her and 
myself. The last thing I needed was 
to get kicked out of the class for 
frightening any medical students 
into thinking that I had a conta-
gious disease from a mad bull, so I 
checked my inflating nostrils at the 
door. 

With a heavy heart and a con-
fused mind, I sat down on the floor, 
cross-legged and with my back 
straight, in order to better attune 
myself to the secrets of the uni-
verse. First of all, I would like to 
recommend to everyone thinking 
of ever taking a meditation class, to 
be the lucky one with their back to 
the wall. Standing up straight for a 
long period of time without a sup-
port was more torturous than hav-

"Canterbury Tales" in front of my

this was what you feel like after get-

Biblical: 
&lievers are not willing to 
really test the Bible's truth 

would gladly accept. A scientific 
theory is always, in herently, an 
approximate and temporary model. 
Trying to prove the Bible on scien-
tific terms implies accepting th is 
epistemology (which, incidentally, 
is what most scientific critics of the 
Bible do), which is somethin$ I 
suspect Christians are not wilhng 
to do. 

One can, of course, play the 
postmodern card and say that sci-
ence is yet another meta narrative, 
and is not entitled to judge some-
thing like the Bible, which stands 
on a completely different metanar-
rative. I will not go head on against 
this argument, but I will make two 
observations. 

The first is that, if this is the 
case, then all attempts to factual-
confirmations of the Bible should 
be abandoned . The second is 
that, by admitting the fallibility of 
science, the Bible itself is rela-
tivized as "yet another metanarra-
tive". 

I sympathize with people who 
look for spiritual meaning in their 
life, although I do not think an old 
book is the right place to find it. 
The attempt to use certain histor-
ical concordances (which, as I 
noticed, are perfectly reasonable, 
given that the writers of the Bible 
were not blind) to prove theologi-
cal points ignores both the ten-
ants of common sense on how 
mythological books are written 
and the nature of scientific episte-
mology. 

Ultimately, this kind of enter-
prise is a disservice to both science 
and religion.

Cellular: . 
Other cities have restricted 
ceU phone use in public 
CoatI ..... ".. ...... 
- 15 percent of them in 
California alone. 

Many theaters, restaurants, 
golf courses and workplaces 
across the country now prohibit 
cell phone use because of the 
complaints of patrons. In 
December, San Diego Mayor 
Susan Golding launched a cam-
paign to limit ce ll phone use in 
certain public places. She sent let-
ters to school districts, local col-
leges, movie theaters and arts 
organizations urging them to dis-
courage allowing cell phone use. 

Much of the debate about limit-
ing cell phones has been concen-
trated around their use by 
motorists. More than 15 states and 
a number of cities have either con-
sidered or are currently debating 
the restricting cell phone use by 
drivers. California had such a mea-
sure on the table three years ago, 
but it was defeated. Earlier this 
month, the City of Santa Monica 
also considered such a ban. Under 
pressure-from telephone company 
lobbyists, that proposal failed . 

The only ci ties in America that 
prohibit cell phone use while dri-

ving are Hilltown, Pen n. and 
Brooklyn, Ohio. Outside the 
United States, Japan, England, 
Switzerland, Israel and Italy ban 
the practice. 

Still, there is no existing law 
mandating an outright ban on cell 
phone use. This comes as no sur-
prise. The cell phone industry has 
extensively lobbied against such 
restrictions, saying they are valu-
able safety tools. It prefers educa-
tion and individual responsibility 
to government regulations. 

The challenge then is to 
restrict cell phone use without 
government help. People should 
learn to be more considerate 
when they use their phones. They 
should turn off the ringing and 
the beeping when they are in situ-
ations where any disturbance 
would be inappropriate. In other 
words, they should not use them 
whenever it could distract the 
people around them. 

To its credit, the cellular phone 
industry has set up its own cam-
paign of teaching proper cell 
phone etiquette. However, there 
will always be the temptation to 
use cell phones irresponsibily. 
Their convenience presents a 
major hurdle to restricting their 
use. There will always be that one 
chatterbox for whom the tempta-
tion to have a one-sided conver-
sation in public proves irresistible.

just and mutually supportive" 
world, Pope John Paul (( celebrat-
ed Easter Mass Sunday in St.

150.000 people. 

From an outdoor altar trans-

79-year-old pope urged followers 
to apply the spirit of Easter to 
modern society. 

"May the message of life pro-

claimed by the angel near the stone 
rolkJ back !Tom the tomb overturn 
the hardness of our hearts: the 
pope said in his annual Easter Urbi 
et Orbi message after the mass. He 
said the "blind egoism of the few" 
should not be allowed to prevail 
over "the cries of pain of the many. 
reducing entire peoples to condi-
tions of degrading misery." 

Easter Mass was the culmina-

cross for two stations at a re-

enactment of Christ's passion 
Friday night and staying up late 
Saturday for a candlelight VIgil in

tized eight people. 

The pope, who suffers tremors 
associated with Parkinson's dis-
ease. shook noticeably during the 
Mass. Church officials do not 
often publicly discuss the pope's 
physical condition . But in an 
tnterview published Sunday in the 
French newspaper Journal du 
Dimanche. the archbishop of 

Paris, Cardinal Jean-Marie 
Lustiger, described the pope as "a 
prisoner in his body." 

"We know that his illness is 
causing progressive paralysis of the 
body, but his mind remains intact: 
Lustiger was quoted as saying. 

He said the pope "retains a spir-

capacity and a memory which are 
extraordinary for someone who

Trade Policy Denied to be Protectionism 
WASHINGTON The 

American labor movement. while 
waging its biggest battle ever 
against trade liberalization, is try-
ing to fend off charges !Tom many 
economists, business executives 
and members of Congress that it 
has re-embraced protectionism. 

Many critics assert that labor's 
across-the-board fight against 
trade expansion measures. includ-
ing the China and A!Tica trade bills, 

represents a crass effort to protect 
American jobs by preventing 
imports from increasing. 

Insisting that they have jettisoned 
their past protectionism. union offi-
cials say they oppose these trade ini-
tiatives only because they fail to pro-
teet the ri~hts of foreign workers. 

With Its power magnified in a 
campaign year, the AFL-CIO. a fed-
eration of 68 member unions, has 
been by far the most powerful voice 

against the China trade bill. helping 
sway scores of Democrats, including 
Rep. Dick Gephardt (D - Mo.), the 
House Democratic leader, to oppose 
it. The Senate is expected to pass the 
China bill easily. But lawmakers say 
that. largely because of labor's 
aggressive opposition, the vote in 
the House, expected next month, is 
now too close to call.

Bush Tells Voters He's Not an lEgghead' 
AUSTIN, Texas - It is the mes-

from his references to undecided

promises from the podium to get

It is the signal embedded in his 
appetites, which veer toward Cheez 
Doodles, Fritos and peanut-butter-

attire: unfussy suits. plain neckties 
and. from time to time, cowboy boots 
as big and brash as the state of Texas.

portion of the $5,400 budgeted for 
the trip. 

"Most of the expenses of this 
trip were out of our control: 
Khullar said. "People don't realize 
how expensive things in Times 
Square are." 

McGinnis said that members of 
the A.S. Council were unaware that 
the executives were going to the 
conference and would have ques-
tioned the trip if given the chance. 

"Hardly anyone even knew they 
were going in the trip: McGinnis 
said. "If we all knew about it. there 
is a good chance they wouldn't 
have been able to go ... It's just 
unfortunate that we didn't know 
beforehand. " 

McGinnis said he discovered

However, the compromise did 
not last. The univerSIty last week 
sent an ther lener of objection, 
this time regarding the use of 
"Tritons." 

"The university does object to 
the use of the name 'Tritons' 
because it is the name adopted by 
UCSD to identify its athletic 
teams: Parode said. "I have asked 
dailyjolt.com to find another name, 
which does not involve the use of a 
name or acronym already used by 
UCSD to identify itself. What that 
might be. ! leave to the folks at dai-
Iyjolt.com." 

Parode added that the universi-
ty only objects to The Daily jolt's 
domain name if It implies associa-
tion with UCSD. 

"I have no reason to believe that 
the university objects to the site in 
its entirety: Parode said. "We only 
ask that it not use university trade 
names in its domain name since 
such use conveys the impression 
that it is affiliated with UCSD." 

Chow said she does not see how 
The Daily Jolt site could be detri-
mental to UCSD. 

"It's only positive: she said. 
"We're promoting UCSD and its 
sites, making students more aware 
of them. We're really hoping we 
won't have to resort to sandiego.dai-
Iyjolt. cum , especially if other San 
Diego schools want to start a Daily 
Jolt site, it wouldn't be fair to 
them." 

Ng, who is in charge of business 
development for The Daily Jolt at 
UCSD, said he is furious with 
UCSD's complaints. 

"It's ridiculous," he said. "The 
university is clearly just trying to 
bully us around. You'd think 
they'd have better things to do." 

The Daily Jolt·s decision to 
comply with UCSD's second 
request is pending. 

Meanwhile. The Daily Jolt at 
UCSD can be found at www.tri-
tons. daily jolt. com and sandiego.dai-

Despite these obstacles, The 
Daily Jolt at UCSD launched suc-

Khullar said the executives 

informed the council of the trip 
before their departure, but also said 
that not everyone knew the details. 

"People knew about Ithe con-
ference], but some weren 't as 
informed as others." he said. "They 
just didn't know the specifics." 

McGinnis said he feels the exec-
utives owe the council an apology 
for what they did. 

"I understand that they are 
waiting for the comminee to finish 
its work, but they could have at 
least apologized for what they did." 
McGinnis said. "I still have yet to 
even hear anything that sounds like 
an apology." 

Marshall Sophomore Senator 
Jeff Dodge said he hopes this mat-
ter does not affect students' per-
ception of the A.S. Council. 

"Hopefully it won't look bad for 
the future." he said. "Right now we

between the students and the

year and this may hurt that 
attempt."

Chow said The Daily Jolt is 
unique because it is specifically

I 
n 1998, Marshall senior Emily 
Green knew she was interested 
in pursuing a career in teaching, 
but she did not know what steps 
to take in order to achieve her 
goal. Then, a friend told her 
about Teach For America, a 
national corps comprised of 

recent college graduates who commit 
two years to teach in urban and rural 
public .schools that have minimal 
resources. Curious about the program, 
Green attended an information session 
and knew right away that she was inter-
ested in participating. Two years later, 
Green is teaching at Willowbrook 
Middle School in Compton, Calif. 

"I felt lost in tmns of how to begin 
my teaching career,w Green said. "Teach 
for America seemed like a great, orga-
nized way to be introduced to the fidd 
of teaching: 

Green is one of over 6,000 people 
who have participated in TFA since its 
creation in 1989. TFA began as an idea 
of Wendy Kopp, then a senior at 
Princeton University. Driven by the 
concern that children in this nation do 
not have equal access to an excellent 
education, Kopp used her senior thesis 
to propose her idea of a national 
teacher corps. Shortly thereafter, the 
Mobil Corporation approved a $26,000 
grant to start the organization, and 
Wendy Kopp began making her thesis a 
reality. 

In the first year, a group of highly 
experienced teachers organized a train-
ing institute for the 500 selected corps 
members. These students immersed 
themselves in a rigorous, five-week 
training session complete with guide-
book seminars. workshops and teaching-
experience. Corps members often refer 
to this training session as a teacher 
"boot camp· because of its demanding 
and fast-paced curriculum. The purpose 
of the training session is to indoctrinate 
all participants with superior teaching 
practices. 

UCSD graduate David Carr, a former 
TFA participant, is now the program 
director for the Los Angeles Bureau. 

"Most aspiring teachers take up to 
four years to learn the skills that we 
were made to learn in five weeks," Carr 
said . . 

To date, TFA has received over 
33,000 applications. and the number of 
applicants increases every year. In the 
past four years. there has been a 37 per-
cent rise in the number ofTFA applica-
tions. In order to accommodate the 
incredible response to the program, 
TFA is expanding and hopes to double 
the number of members accepted this 
year. 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 11 

College graduates looking at a 
teaching career can join Teach 

for America and involve 
themselves in the quest to 

equalize access for all students 
to academic excellence 

Those interested in applying for the 
program must begin by completing a 
written llpplication. Approximately 80 
percent of these applicants are invited to 
interviews. This year, 4,065 people from 
all over the United States applied to the 
program, and approximately 25 percent 
of those will be accepted. 

Corps members have impressive 
backgrounds: 87 percent held leader-
ship positions on their college campus-

teachers at improving reading skills. 
TFA alumni are also involved with 

running more than 10 charter or exper-
imental schools within the publ ic 
school system. One Houston charter 
school reported a 36-point average 
increase in students' standardized test 
scores. 

"These are bright kids: said Green, 
who is completing her second year of 
teaching this year. "The problem lies in

es, their average SAT score is 1247 and 
this year's corps had a 3.40 average high 
school GPA. 

TFA selects applicants with the qual-
ities necessary to make excellent teach-
ers - the ability to overcome chal-
lenges, strong ambition and a commit-
ment to setting the highest expectations 
for themselves and their students. 

Monica Vasquez, who graduated 
from UC Berkeley in 1993, taught at an 
L.A. elementary school for three years 
through the program. Now the western 
recruitment director for TFA, Vasquez 
cherishes her time spent teaching. 

"This program is unique in that it 
really capitalizes on a time in people's 
lives, right after college, where they have 
the ability to commit to a program like 
this.· Vasquez said. 

Over the last 10 years, TFA has 
served as a catalytic force in public edu-
cation because of its ability to take 
young, energetic people who are pas-
sionate about inequity and give them 
practical exposure to public education. 
Each year, over 100,000 children in 
public schools throughout the United 
States benefit from this program. 

A 1999 study by Kane, Parsons and 
Associates found that 90 percent of 
principals think the presence of TFA 
corps members is advantageous for stu-
dents and for schools. However, the 
incredible impact of corps members is 
clearly shown in the progress made by 
students they teach. A survey 
revealed that 79 percent of 
parents of students taught 
by TFA members rate 
corps members better than 
their children's other 

the fact that no one has ever told them 
. that education shOuld be a priority: 

While TFA consists of a two-year 
teaching commitment, according to the 
program, 54 percent of its alum:' • 
ni have remained in the field of 
education, serving as teachers, 
principals or administrators. 
Only 13 percent said they 
would have gone into edu-
cation on their 
own, regardless 
of TFA. The 
remaining par-
ticipants have 
pursued other 
careers, nonethe-
less able to apply all 
that they learned in 
the two-year program 
to their respective 
fields. 

Man y 

alumni who have gone on to medical 
school have started practices in inner 
cities and low-income areas. Many oth-
ers have pursued careers in law, making 
it their goal to fight for educational 
equity. Recently, one alumnus won elec-
tion to the state legislature in Mai ne on 
an education platform. Other former 
corp members have become passionate 
advocates of providing education to dis-
advantaged students from fields such as 
journalism, business and politics. 

"One great aspect about the Teach 
for America program is the fact that it 
allows you to do something about the 
inequity in public education, and still 
pursue other goals that you might 
have: Vasquez said. · Students are wor-
ried that if they commit to teach, that 
they will be unable to go to graduate 
school. Teach for America allows them 
to teach for two years and then pursue 
other goals.'

The Editor's Soapbox 
A pitiful streak cannot he escaped by the confines of college as fate once again rears its ugly head 
Iy JOSH CROUSE 
Associate Features Editor 

All right, now I'm pissed. 
It happened once, and I 

laughed. Yes, it 's very funny, ha 
ha. It happened twice. It stung a 
little, but I shook it off and 
chalked another one up to bad 
luck. However, when I had five 
girls cancel on me the week 
before five consecutive formal 
dances, I th ink it 's safe to assume 
that I've made the Big Guy's shit 
list. 

This now infamous (and quite 
impressive) streak I am building.on 
began in high school. 

It was my junior formal. I was 
dating a tall, gorgeous blonde who 
I thought I was in love with. It was 
my first girlfriend - what can I 
say? 

I treated her like a princess. I 
was always taking her to nice 
restaurants and buying her flowers 
for no real reason other than to see 
her smile. I was basically working 
my ass off writing articles for my 
local newspaper just to be able to 
keep her happy. 

Our junior formal was fast 
approaching. It was the big winter 
dance where the girls ask the 
guys and everyone has a good 
time. Since I hadn't been asked 
my previous two years, this was 
going to be my first formal dance. 
I was excited to be going with 
such a beautiful girl. I had a nice 
suit picked out as well as reserva-
tions at the best restaurant in 
town . 

Little did I know that I would 
soon have to throw all of those 

plans out the window. 
The week before the dance, my 

girlfriend informed me that she 
had fallen in love with a football 
player from Atwater (a small hick 
town 40 miles away from Modesto) 
and would be going to the dance 
with him. She smiled her little 
smile as she ripped OUt my young 
heart and stomped on it with her 
four-inch heels. 

What a bitch! 
With the formal fiasco mentally 

blocked from my memory, I soon 
~rew excited at the prospect of my 
Junior prom. I was looking for 
redemption. I was determined to 
escort the hottest girl in school and 
show my ex-girlfriend what she 
was missing with her com-fed hick 
boyfriend. 

That was when I found her - a 
beautiful girl who had one of the 
nicest bodies I have ever seen. I was 
in heaven when she smiled and 
said she would love to go to the 
prom with me. Prom was to be held 
the Friday a fter our spring break, so 
I spent the entire break with my 
would-be date. 

Then fate reared its ugly head 
again . She called me the Friday 
before prom, sobbing, saying that 
her father forbade her from going 
to the prom due to a low midterm 
score. There went prom. 

My senior year was going to be 
different. I was determined to exor-
cise the demons of my junior year, 
and things started out great. 

I had a girlfriend to start out the 
year. She lived 100 miles away in' 
Sacramento, but I could make the 
drive in about an hour. I was crazy 
about her and excited to be going 

All of this has led me to a 
lot of late-night 
philosophizing about the 
existence of God and 
Fate, as well as what I 
could have possibly done 
to piss them off so much. 
In the end I just smile 
and think that things will 
get better. I am pretty 
cimfident that they will, 
considering the fact that 
they have nowhere to go 
but Up. 
to my formal with her. 

It was going to be a great time 
- she was going to come down for 
the weekend and stay at my house. 
Things were looking very good -
too good, in fact. I had a suspicion 
that something would happen to 
again thwart my happiness, but my

friend told me I was just being pes-
simistic. 

Low and behold, Fate showed 
up again, winked at me and blew 
me a soft kiss as my date canceled 
four days before the formal. 

Her excuse was at least genuine 
- her best friend had scored five 
ounces of pot and was throwing a 
giant party that weekend. At lease 
she had her priorities straight. 
Needless to say, we didn't see each 
other after that. 

My senior prom pretty much 
fit the same mold. I had a girl-
friend . She was pretty. I was 
happy. 

Then, fate ripped out my 
spleen and nibbled gently on it. I 
didn't have a date. 

Then college came around. I 
heard about the semiformals from 
some upper-classmen friends that I 
had. They said that it would be a 
really good time and that I should 
definitely go to it. 

I was initially pessimistic about 
asking anyone to the Warren semi-
formal. I was admittedly scared 
about another chance encounter 
with fate. 

Eventually I got over my fear, 
and amazingly had two dates to the 
semiformal. Now, some of you 
feminazis out there are probably 
shouting "What a pig!" but let me 
explain. 

First, I was talking to an old 
friend from high school who was 
living near Los Angeles. Knowing 
my horrible luck with formal 
dances, she offered to be my date if 
I couldn't find anyone else. I was 
relieved - I had a back-up date. 
You can imagine how elated I was 

when another friend of mine said 
she would love to go to the dance 
with me. I had two dates! 

There was no way that I was 
going to have this dance blown for 
me. 

However, I was sadly underesti-
mating how mud\ I am hated by 
the Big Guy. It was constantly in 
the back of my mind (I guess I am 
a little pessimistic, but I think I 
have a right to be), which is why, 
upon hearing a knock at my door, 
I simply unlocked the door, 
walked to the couch and bent 
over, knowing all too well that fate 
was there to ream me once again. 

In a matter of an hour, my 
friend from San Diego canceled 
because her boyfriend was conllng 
into town, and my friend from Los 
Angeles canceled because she 
couldn't get out of work. 

All of this has led me to a lot of 
late-night philosophizing about the 
existence of God and fate, as well as 
what I could have possibly done to 
piss them off so much. In the end I 
just smile and think that things will 
get better. I am pretty confident 
that they will, considering the fact 
that they have nowhere to go but 
up. 

So there it is. My entire,

Representing the UC Student Body 
Student regent allows associated students access to the regents agenda and policy making 
IJ JUUI PAIGI 
Contributing Staff Writer 

The UC Regents are a body of 
individuals who determine the 
major policies of the UC system. 
Each year, a student from one of the 
UC campuses joins this group to 
give students greater access to and 
representation in the formation of 
policies that shape their education. 

"This is really our only opportu-
nity for a student to meet with the 
regents on a regular basis: UCSD's 
A.S. Vice President External Affairs 
Terrence Patterson said of the stu-
dent regent position. "We can't even 
speak to the regents in the meetings 
unless we are put on the agenda. 
The student regent has the ability to 
submit things to the agenda." 

A.S. Secretary Anna Mason, 
who is closely involved with the 
student regent application process, 
said the position - created in 1974 
to ~ive students a stronger voice in 
University policy-making - is very 
important. 

As a voting member of the UC 
Board of the Regents, this student 
ideally represents the interests of 
the UC students to the board. 

The student regent must be an 
undergraduate, graduate or profes-
sional student in good standing at 
one of the nine UC campuses at 
the time of application and during 
his or her term. A student who 
holds .an appointed or elected stu-
dent government position is not 
eligible for appointment unless he 
or she resigns. A student regent 
cannot serve more than one term. 

The currmt student regent is 
Michelle Pannor, an undergraduate 

MOSSY 
CHEVROLET 

majoring in Communication and 
Conservation Resource Studies at 
UC Berkeley. Pannor plans to attend 
graduate school in public policy. She 
said she became interested in the 
student regent position when the 
board was voting on SP-l, an initia-
tive concerning affirmative action in 
admissions. 

Pannor feels that student's 
access to policy making should be 
increased. 

"My goal is that at a local level, 
students' voices will be heard; 
Pan nor said. "I meet with the office 
of the president and the chancel-
lors and encourage them to meet 
with the students more. I feel it is 
important to promote interaction 
between the administration and the 
students." 

Pan nor meets reguI~rly with 
the University of California 
Students Association and remains 
in touch with other student organi-
zations so she can effectively repre-
sent their interests. Pannor said she 
understands that it takes a group of 
students to effectively mobilize any 
legislation. 

Three issues that Pan nor is cur-
rently working on include student 
housing, fees and grant aid, student 
housing and the admissions 
process. She is searching for ways 
to provide more student housing at 
more affordable prices. She is also 
lobbying for more funding for edu-
cation. 

"The UC portion of the state 
budget has decreased; Pannor said. 
·We are looking for ways that we can 
get more grant aid and fellowships." 

As student regent, Pannor also 
addresses the lack of diversity 

throl.lghout the UC system. 
"I would like to see the student 

body population more reflective of 
the diversity that exists in 
California: Pannor said. "I want to 
know why we use the SATs, why 
we rely so heavily on standardized 
tests." . 

The regents establish policies 
including campus development, 
admissions, financial aid, student 
fees and the financial management 
of the university. They also appoint 
the chancellors, the president of 
the university, the directors of the 
major depanment of energy 
research laboratories and the offi-
cers of the regents. The board 
operates through seven standing 
committees and various subcom-
mittees and special committees. 

The UC Board of Regents has 
26 members. Eighteen are appoint-
ed by the governor for 12-year 
terms, seven are ex-officio mem-
bers and one is a student. 

While in training. the student 
regent must attend all meetings of 
the board, which are two days long 
and occur every other month, but is 
not given a vote. 

In past years, the student regent 
has participated in a three-month 
training period before becoming a 
full voting member of the board. 
Beginning this year, however, the 
student will be a "regent designate" 
for one year before his or her official 
term. The student regent designate 
will work along side the acting stu-
dent regent during his or her tenure. 

Pannor is optimistic about the 
possible effects of this reform. 

"It will be better because there 
will be two students. There will be 

twice as many opportunities to visit 
the student regent and they will be 
able to get a lot more done; 
Pannor said. . 

Several perks come along with 
the power of being a student regent. 
The student regent does not have 
to pay the mandatory university 
fees and tuition during the academ-
ic year in which he or she serves as 
voting member of the board. The 

NIcholas Runco/Guardian 
student regent is also reimbursed 
for expenses during meetings and is 
provided with an office and tele-
phone at his or her home campus. 

"These ~rks are well-earned; 
Pan nor said. "The job is very 
demanding and time consuming. 
Timing is really crazy. Recently I 
have been in at least two cities per

Regent: . 
2001-2002 school year 
had onlY 49 applications 
week. You have to be quick. The 
traveling of a [studentl regent is 
overwhelming .• 
. The application process begins 
In April, when each application 
for student regen t is reviewed by a 
student regional nominating con-
vention. Tho commissions nar-
row down the pool and invite 
select applicants to continue the 
interviewing process. 

UCSD is part of the Southern 
Regional Nominating 
Commission, which includes the 
UC schools in Irvine, Los Angeles. 
Riverside and Santa Barbara. 

The Northern Regional 
Nominating Commission choos-
es students from the Berkeley, 
Davis, San Francisco and Santa 
Cruz campuses. . 

One student from each college 
is chosen to continue in the 
selection process. Nine semifinal-
ists are interviewed by the UCSA 
Board of Directors and three 
finalists continue to be inter-
viewed by a special committee of 
the regents. The student regent is 
appointed in September. 

There were 49 appJications for 
the 2001-02 student regent posi-
tion, and seven were from UCSD. 

Considering the number of stu-
dents in the UC system, 49 is a 
surprisingly low turnout There are 
165,968 undergraduate. graduate 
and professional students in the 
entire UC system, 19,918 of which 
are from UCSD. 

"Students might think it is too 
huge - something that they just 
can't do; Mason said. 

Many students do not know 
the position is available. Those 
that do know may not know how 
to apply, or they may be intimi-
dated by the high caliber of the 
competition. 

Officials are eager to increase 
the number of applicants -
recruiting efforts, such as hiring a 
student to talk directly to students 
about the position, are increasing. 

*Most of the applicants are 
heavily involved in either student 
orgamzations or student outreach, 
whether on the student govern-
ment level or on their own student 
organization; Patterson said. 
*Most are heavily involved in aca-
demic work as well, such as doing 
heavy research in their academic 
field. They come with extensive 
resumes. They must ~ve a good 
idea of how University of 
California Office of the President 
is run, and how university opera-
tions take place.· 

The position usually attracts 
students who are familiar with 
university issues and policies. 
Most importantly, this student 
has to be dedicated to represent-
ing UC students. They have to 
interact with students, be con-
stantly alert and willing to work 
hard. They are the most powerful 
voice students have in the UC 
system. 

Applications for the 2002-03 
student regent will be due at the 
end of next winter quarter. 

Linda Rae Sabo, who served 
during the 1982-83 school year, 
has been the only student r~gent 
from UCSD. 

Justin Fong, a graduate stu-
dent in public policy at UCLA, 
was appointed student regent for 
the 2000-01 school year. His term 
will begin on July 1. 

Pan nor will be coming to 
UCSD Monday, April 24 for the 
Hate Free Campus Campaign, 
which will include a rally at 4:30 
p.m. in Price Center, sponsored by 
Student Affirmative Action and 
Human Relation Program, fol-
lowed by the Edward James Olmos 
lecture at 7 p.m. at Price Center 
Ballroom, which is sponsored by 
A.S. Council. 

Pannor welcomes students to 
come with questions and ideas. 
"I'd love to talk; Pannor said.

Trip to Africa Presents a New Perspective 
A mission of medical mercy to Africa gives one UCSD student an opportunity to serve his fellow man 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Staff Writer 

For many of the future doctors 
at UCSD, practicing medicine 
outside the classroom is not an 
option. Indeed, helping patients 
outside a hospital, let alone the 
entire United States, is a rarity for 
almost any doctor in training. 
Recently, however, one of UCSD's 
very own students had the unique 
opportunity to practice medicine 
in the African country The 
Gambia. 

A sophomore at Revelle 
College, Daniel Hampton was.one 
of a select number of students 
who participated in a weeklong 
program called Africa 2000. Its 
mission is to treat people in need 
from other countries. The pro-
gram consists of a team of doctors, 
nurses, students and other med-
ical personnel from the United 
States. 

According to Hampton, it was 
someone he knew who first 
referred him to participate in Africa 
2000. 

"My family has an old family 
friend who's a pediatrician in Santa 
Monica - Robert Hamilton," 
Hampton said . "He called and 
asked if I wanted to be a part of the 
team since he knew I was a premed 
student. I was really excited, so I 

id yes." 
Arriving at night, the team was 

welcomed by a local citizen. Once 
there, the group lodged at the 
Tafbel, a popular hotel for tourists 
located on the beaches. 

From Monday to Thursday, the 
team set up makeshift clinics, 

complete with pharmacies, in two 
locations - one at a nearby 
church and another at a local 
township on the. outskirts of the 
city. where the home of the town-
ship's chief served as the site for 
the clinic. 

At both clinics, huge numbers 
of people came seeking help. In 
total , the Africa 2000 team served 
approximately 3,000 people. It 
was forced to turn away many 
others. 

Hamilton offered his view on 
the many people that the team 
encountered. 

"It was like a crush of humani-
ty," Hamilton said. "We would liter-
ally come to the clinic and there 
would be a crowd of people waiting 
for us. We would literally have to 
tread our way through the crowd, 
almost like parting the [Red Sea], if 
you wilL" 

Hampton shared this senti-
ment, pointing out the number of 
people who used this service. 

"It was like dealing with a mob," 
Hampton said . "The crowds were 
pushing and fighting to get 
through ." 

Still, he was quick to add that 
not all the people were so aggres-
sive. 

"I got two different views, both 
the personal and impersonal." 
Hampton said. "Many of the peo-
ple I met on an individual basis, 
which was very nice. You see more 
of the scope of the situation and 
feel more compassion for the peo-
ple you treat." . 

The most com mon ailments 
treated were worms, intestinal 
parasites and respiratory prob-

"It reminded me of the 
abundant wealth we have 
as Americans and how 
often we take them for 
granted. When I came 
back, I could see more 
clearry; life made more 
sense. I realized that these 
people, even though they 
had very little, were still 
very happy. When I 
become a doctor; I know 
that I'll want to do more 
trips like this."

gitis. 

A highlight for Hampton was

renowned author Alex Haley. The 
team was invited to his home, 
where they were welcomed gra-
ciously. 

Hamilton found the experience 
to be very poignant and beneficial 
to his work toward becoming a 
medical doctor. 

"It was very moving to think 
that a descendant of a slave, Kunta 
Kinte, came to become the ambas-
sador of IThel Gambia," Hamilton 
said. "George embodies a tremen-
dous amount of poetic redemp-
tion." 

Hampton remembered Haley 
for his warmth and generosity. 

"He supported what we were 
doing: Hampton said. "He was 
such a great host." 

Hamilton thought Hampton 
was the perfect choice for the pro-
gram. 

"Daniel is incredibly responsi-
ble and bright, and I knew he'd 
make a great contribution to this 
program," Hamilton said. "I think 
for him, it deepened his interest in 
the medical field." 

Hamilton pointed out the 
importance of charity work in 
countries less fortunate than the 
United States, particularly those 
in Central America and Africa 
where access to medical care is 
often impeded by a lack of 
resources. 

U I think whenever you go to a 
foreign culture and you see the 
need that is there, it becomes very 
tangible and real," Hamilton said. 
"We work very hard, and even 
though you can't help everyone, 
you can at leaSt help improve the 
living situations of many. In that 

respect, you cOLTIe back with a 
sense of assurance." 

Hamilton also noted how chal-
lenging it is to set up medical pro-
grams such as Africa 2000. 

"When you ship medication to 
another country, you need approval 
and certification from all sorts of 
groups, like pharmaceutical firms 
and the government," Hamilton 
said. "It takes a tremendous 
amount of effort to get these teams 
together." 

Hampton found the experience 
to be deeply moving and hopes to 
participate in more charitable med-
ical programs. 

"[The program] has encouraged 
me more to become a doctor," 
Hampton said. · It reminded me of 
the abundant wealth we have as 
Americans and how often we take 
them for granted. When I came 
bark, I could see more clearly; life 
made more sense. I realized that 
these people, even though they had 
very little, were still very happy. 
When I become a doctor, I know 
that I'll want to do more trips like 
this." 

All treatments and medications 
were provided to patients free of 
charge. The program was pre-
dominantly funded by corpora-
tions, in particular premier med-
ical supply corporation 
McKesson. The tOlal cost of sup-
plies and the trip was approxi-
mately $40,000. 

All remaining medications 
and supplies were donated to 
local hospitals, including thl' 
Royal Victory Hospital in Banjul , 
the largest hospital in The 
Gambia .

about the Teach for

The NHL is making 
changes for the worse 

I always make a poi~t of going 
to a couple of hockey games a year. 
Lately those visits have been get-
ting less and less enjoyable, main-
ly because of changes the league 
has made in the last few years. 

The weather may be getting 
warmer and winter may have 
already given way to spring, but 
the boys of the National Hockey 
League are only beginning their 
playoff series. While watching 
games for the last week, I realized 
one thing: The NHL sucks! 

I love watching hockey games, 
mostly for the checks and the 
brawls, but as a business and as 
the most powerful hockey league 
in the world, the HL has thor-
oughly failed. 

First, the league's rules commit-
tee has to make the rules more cut 
and dry. Penalty rules may be writ-
ten with good intent, but out on the 
ice, the linesmen are the ones who 
interpret what is necessary to call 
and what is not. This happens with 
fouls in the NBA and balls and 
strikes in Major League Baseball, 
but the mistakes are never so bla-
tant as they are in the HL. Rarely 
will a mistake by an official in base-
ball or football cost a team a game. 
This kind of atrocity happens all 
the time in the HL. 

I am mainly talking about 
penalties that occur (or don't 
occur) right before a goal is 
scored. Many goals are ca lled off 
because players were in the crease 
before the puck was, but there are 
many instances, such as in the 
example that went against 
Toronto, when players are in the 
crease but the linesmen decide not 
to call anything. 

It is only :I matter of time 
before a series is decided on one of 
these subjective decisions by the 
officials. 

Secondly, the NHL lets entirely 
too many teams into the playoffs. 
A team has to be absolutely 
wretched during the regular sea-
son to not make the playoffs. Once 
in the playoffs, these bad teams 
can get lucky and knock a top-
notch team off in the first round . 
This makes for exciting play, but it 
penalizes teams such as the St. 
Louis Blues, who play great all sea-
son and then hit a small snag for a 
few games in Apri!. 

As long as the NHL allows the 
dregs of the league to make the 
playoffs, the television ratings for 
regular season games will remain 
in the gutter. 

My biggest complaint with the 
way the NHL has handled itself 
over the last five years is how it has 
expanded into the sunbelt. When 
Wayne Gretzky was traded from 
Edmonton to Los Angeles, hockey 
in the sun belt was officially born. 
Now, there are teams in Anaheim, 
Phoenix, Tampa Bay and many 
other places that rarely - if ever -
see temperatures cold enough to 
freeze the ice. 

Since the invasion of hockey 
into the southern region of the 
United States, the NHL has gone 
from a Canadian craze and a U.S. 
afterthought to a joke in both 
countries. 

By trying to ' appeal to the 
younger, attention-deprived gener-

Softball Loses Two to USD 
A strong performance by the Tritons is all for naught in two 1-0 losses to their Division I rivals 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Spor ts Editor 

A doubleheader showdown took place at 
UCSD this last Wednesday. In one corner was 
UCSD, a Division III powerhouse. The Tritons 
are ranked No. 1 in the region and third in the 
nation with a record of 22-7. 

The Tritons' opponent was cross-town rival 
University of San Diego, a Division I school 
with a 23-23 record. 

Both contests of the doubleheader were tight-
ly fought, but each ended in disappointment for 
UCSD. The 1l-itons lost each game 1-0. 

ul think they weren't enthused: UCSD soft-
ball coach Patti Gerckens said. "They weren't 
up. I don't know why. It's not that they played 
poorly, but they didn't play up to their poten-
tia!." 

One run in both of the contest was all that 
kept UCSD from beating not only a nemesis 
from just down the freeway, but also a Division 
I program. 

"They're a rival: Gerckens continued. "We 
play them every year, and we usually split with 
them. They're Division I, but we get up for the 
game: 

In the first contest, the Tritons brought out 
their ace Leea Harlan. Harlan entered the game 
with a record of 9-2 and had recently tos ed a 
no-hitter. 

The Triton hurler lived up to the billing, 
striking out six. . 

The Toreros featured Amy Lopez on the 
mound. Lopez has been a workhorse for USD 
this season, tossing 27 games, winning 13 of 
them. She did well in quieting the Triton bats 
when she struck out eight batters and allowed 
only five hits. 

UCS D had been on an offensive tear as of

Bridges was the lone highlight in game one 
with two hits. 

Harlan kept USD at bay until the seventh 
inning. Then, a costly fielding error with two 
outs allowed the Toreros to have runners on 
fi rst and second. The runner on second, Katy 
Morrison, came around to score on a hit by 
Jennifer Bridges. 

"She couldn't find the grip on the ball : 
recalled Gerckens of the error. 

UCS D was unable to counter in the bottom 
of the seventh, and the game was over. 

The second game was just as heartbreaking. 
UCS D sent the very capable arm of Erin 

Flanigan to the mound. She gave up four hits 
and struck out three. 

Jade Quentin, despi te not starting for USD, 
picked up the win by pitching six innings and 
allowing only two hits.

Tennis Suffers Crushing Defeat at the Hands of Claremont 
Injuries and inconsistency send men's tennis team to a loss that wiU hurt their chances to make NatUmals

As Saturday afternoon's 
match came to a close, fans could 
actually see the air seeping out of 
the men's tennis team's collective 
balloon. The Tritons knew it was 
imperative to win this at-home 
match to have any realistic hope 
of making nationals this year, but 
as losing results were slowly 
reported by the Triton players, 
the chances for victory began to 
wane away. 

When the last score was tal-
lied, the Tritons had suffered a 
crushing blow to their hopes of 
making Nationals because of the 
2-5 loss to Claremont-McKenna. 

Early on, the Tritons' chance 
was looking promising. UCSD 

won two out of the three doubles 
sets and took the doubles point 
to take a 1-0 lead in the match. 

At No. 1 doubles, Dan 
Albrecht and Mike Rosett played 
the solid doubles match that 
Head Coach ' Eric 
Steidlmayer has come 
to expect from the 
duo. Albrecht and 
Rosett were never 
in trouble and 
rolled to a routine 8-4 
victory. 

The match at No. 2 dou-
bles was similar. Joe Diehl and 
Sean Nagle were able to fend off 
some big ground strokes from 
their opponents and win 8-5. 

Cedric Mazzara and an 
injured Michael Meyer teamed 
up to play at No. 3 doubles and 

played well enough to get into a 
tie-breaker. Once there, the tan-
dem did not have enough to pull 
through and lost the set 9-8, but 
the 1l-itons did not need the vic-

tory to secure the point. 
·We put Meyer, in 
doubles today because 

he is so coordinated 
that he can play 
with basically only 
one hand: 

Steidlmayer said. "We 
expect him to get the cast 

off in a week and a half and 
be ready to play singles again in 
two weeks, probably." 

Unfortunately for the Thtons, 
singles play presented a 180-
degree turn from their results in 
doubles. Things started out in 

promi~ing fashion - the 1l-itons 

were either up or tied in four of 
the six doubles sets halfway 
through the first sets of the 
matches. 

That all fell apart as the 
matches wore on and the Tritons 
eventually lost five of the six 
matches en route to their 2-5 
defeat in the match. 

At No. 1 singles, Albrecht won 
six consecutive games after drop-
ping the first game, taking the 
first set against his opponent 6-1 
From there, Albrecht lost 12 of 
·the next 14 games and lost the 
next two sets 6-2, 6-0. 

"Dan hit some great shots in 
the first set, but [ don't think he 
should ever lose 6-0 to anybody: 
Steidlmayer said. "His serve and
