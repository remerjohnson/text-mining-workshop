JERUSALEM - Reversing a 
previous decision, the Israeli 
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday 
that the government was riot justi-
fied in holding Lebanese detainees 
as "bargaining chips" for the 
release of captured Israeli soldiers. 

Following a hearing behind 
closed doors. the court ordered 
eight of the 15 Lebanese being 
held in Israel released from prison 
immediately. Seven others were in 
another group not included in the 
petition considered by the court. .

The biggest bull market in the 
history of the Nasdaq stock mar-
ket has given way to the fastest 
bear market ever, as technology 
stocks have gone from stars to 
sturn biers. 

With Tuesday's decline of 
286.27 points, or 7.06 percent, to 
3,769.63, the Nasdaq composite 
index is down 25.3 percent from 
the high it set just over a month 
ago, on March 10. It was the sixth 
worst day in Nasdaq history on a 
percentage basis. and left the index

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -
The U.S. Senate narrowly 
approved legislation Friday that 
would increase the amount of Pell 
Grant financial aid availa.ble to eli-
gible college students. 

Pell Grants, money given by the 
federal government to college stu-
dents who demonstrate financial 
need, will now be available in sums 
up to $3,700 - a $400 im:rease 
from the current $3,300 maxi-
mum. Pell Grants are also available 
in sums as small as $400.

Results will be released 
at Round Table Pizza at 
4:30 p.m. Thursday 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

For the first time ever, students are 
using Studentlink to elect next year's 
AS. Council. While online voting was 
supposed to increase voter turnout, the 
number of students who have voted so 

• ' far is down compared to last year. 
As of 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, 1,987 

students, or 13.5 percent of undergrad-
uates, had voted, compared to the third 
day of elections last year when approx-
imately 2,400 students had voted. 

Approximately 3,600 students 
turned out to vote in last year's elec-
ti;)n . 

Anna Mason, the A.S. executive 
secretary, said that because many 
people can now vote 24 hours a day, 
she hopes that the numbers will 
increase before polls close. She said 
500 people voted on Monday night 
and that the trend of nighttime voting 
might continue. 

Students th is yea r can vote from 
any computer with access to the 
Internet. In addition, A.S. has set up 
computers on Library W~lk near the 
Price Center. 

Previously, polling sites were set 
up at several sites across campus, and 
voting was done in the traditional 
hole-punch method. 

Mason said on,line voting is actu-
ally saving the A.S. Council money. 
She sa id that this year the A.S. 
Council does not need to pay poll 
workers. 

She added that the use of 
Studentlink fo r vo ting has been made 
available for free by the university. 
She said that with the money saved, 
the A.S. Council was able to spend 
more money on advertising elections 
an~ that this year, unlike most years, 
the A.S Council did not charge the 

QeWj Pill/Guardian college councils money to run their 
CIIoIoe: Warren sophorrwrt Cliff Kao casts his vote for next year's A.S. Caunal via a computer terminal on Library

normal" as she left. 
Valadez said someone may

Student DIes of Unknown 
C ..... at Kent State 
Fraternity IWty 

KENT, Ohio - Autopsy results 
Monday on a John Carroll 
University freshman shed no light 
on what caused the 19-year-old to 
collapse and die at a Kent State 
Delta Upsilon rave party over the 
weekend. 

Jared R. Chrzanowski, of 
Willoughby, Ohio was pronounced 
dead at Robinson Memorial 
Hospital at 4:28 a.m. Sunday, Kent 
police said. Paramedics were called 
at 3:43 a.m. and responded to the 
fraternity house after members 
found Chrzanowski unconscious 
and unresponsive in a second-floor 
bedroom. 

Lt. Ray Stein of the Kent City 
Police Department said there were no 
signs that Chrzanowski had been in a 
fight, and there was no evidence of 
drug use in the fraternity house. Delta 
Upsilon President Mike Pfahl said his 
fraternity:s strict rules keep illegal 
substances out. 

The party was by invitation only, 
and Chrzanowski was invited by a fra-
ternity brother, Pfahl said. The frater-
nity has people at the door to check 
identification.

BRIEFLY 

UC Professors Receive Guggenheims 
Nine University of California researchers have 

been awarded Guggenheim fellowships for 2000, 
the New York-based John Simon Guggenheim 
Memorial Foundation has announced. 

The foundation said this year's fellowship win-
ners included 182 artists, scholars and scien-
tists from more than 2,900 applicants In the 
United States and Canada for awards totaling 
$6,345,000. 

Guggenheim fellows are appointed on the 
basis of distinguished achievement and excep-
tional promise. They include writers, painters, 
sculptors, photographers, filmmakers, choreog-
raphers, physical and biological scientists, 
social scientists, and scholars In the humanities. 
M any of them hold appointments in colleges and 
universities, and a number have no academic 
affiliation. 

This year's Guggenheim fellows at the 
University of California are Patricia Wenjie 
Cheng, professor of psychology at UCLA; Donald 
J. DePaolo, professor of geochemistry at UC 
Berkeley; Lauren B. Edelman, professor of law 
and sociology at UC Berkeley; Alexei V. 
Filippenko, professor of astronomy at UC 
Berkeley; Amelia Jones, professor of art history 
at UC Riverside; Susanne Lohmann, professor of 
political science and of policy studies and direc-
tor of the Center for Comparative Political 
Economy at UCLA; Donka Mlnkova, professor of 
English at UCLA; Vicente L Rafael, associate 
professor of communications at UCSD; and 
Daniel S. Rokhsar, professor of physics at UC 
Berkeley, and head of computational and theo-
retical biology at Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. 

Guggenheim fellowships are grants made for 
a minimum of six months and a maximum of 12 
months. The average grant awarded in 2000 is 
approximately $34,000. 

The Guggenheim foundation has awarded 
more than $192 million in fellowships to almost 
15,000 individuals. 

University Expands Spanllll 
Exchange Program 

Building on a relationship that dates back 
several decades, the University of California is 
expanding its exchange program with the 
Complutense University in Madrid to enhance 
research projects of mutual interest to 

California and Spain, the director of UC's 
Education Abroad Program announced this 
week. 

The collaboration, called the New Del Amo 
Program, is named in honor of Gregorio del Amo, 
a well-known Southern California physician and 
philanthropist who emigrated from Spain in the 
late 1880s and worked to increase academic 
collaboration between California and his native 
Spain. Del Amo was a Complutense alumnus. 

Program funds will be provided by 
Complutense and UC to support joint research 
led by their faculty. 

The New Del Amo Program will encourage 
research projects in all disciplines, based on a 
memorandum of understanding signed between 
Complutense and the University of California last 
November. 

Proposals for 2()()()'()1 projects are due by 
May 31, 2000. Awards range from $5,000 
grants to facilitate collaboration among faculty 
and researchers to $20,000 for joint team pr~ 
jects. 

Projects, to be cCHIirected by a researcher 
from both the University of California and 
Complutense, are expected to lead to: develop-
ment of major, long-term collaborations; signifi-
cant advancement of scholarship in the arts, 
humanities, natural sciences and social sci-
ences; strengthening of academic and research 
capabilities of both participating groups; devel-
opment of innovative binational instruction or 
new courses or programs; and/or public service 
and education programs addressing critical 
issues in Spain or the United States. 

One third of the award funds will be devoted 
to a bilateral core project or theme, which, for 
the first period, will be processes of integration 
and globalization. 

The Humanities Research Institute at UC 
Irvine will serve as the UC home for the New Del 
Amo Program. In Madrid, the program will be 
administered through the Office of the Vice-
Rector for International Affairs. 

Program oversight is maintained by an exec-
utive steering committee of faculty from each 
university. 

For more information and application materi-
als, please contact the Humanities Research 
Institute via e-mail at uchri@uci.edu. Also, infor-
mation will soon be available on the HRI Web 
site at www.hri.uci.edu.

Israel: 
Spokeswoman said 
Lebanese wiU be released 

seven are Sheik Abdel Karim 
Obeid. a Shiite Muslim spiritual 
leader in the Hezbollah guerrilla 
movement, who was abducted in 
1989 from southern Lebanon, and 
Mustafa Dirani, a leader of the 
Amal militia who was kidnapped 
in 1994 and also transferred to 
Israel. 

The two have been held by the 
Israeli army, apart from other 
detainees, and their fate was 
unclear. 

Human rights lawyers said the 
court's ruling was broad and 

should apply to all seven Lebanese 
whose release was not ordered 
Wednesday. 

A spokeswoman for Israel's 
prisons excluded Dirani and Obeid 
when she told Agence France-Press 
that "all 13 Lebanese held by the 
prisons authority will be released 
and returned to Lebanon as soon 
as the technical arrangements have 
been finalized" with the 
International Committee of the 
Red Cross. She said the two 
detained Lebanese leaders were not 
under the control of the prison 
authorities. 

Highlighting the sensitivity of 
the case, the Supreme Court 
delayed releasing the 50-page deci-
sion so it could be reviewed for 
classified information. Instead, the 
coun issued a one-paragraph sum-

National News 
Nasdaq: 
Technology stocIcs have 
been in a decline 

January. 
A 20 percent fall from a peak is 

traditionally viewed as an indica-
tion of a bear market, although that 
definition may be less relevant now, 
given the unprecedented volatility 
of the market, in which a stock can 
rise or fall rapidly within minutes, 
even without any particular news 
regarding the company. 

There has been some bad news 
from what have been the hotte~t 
industries. 

"We are starting to get informa-
tion on technology fundamentals 
that are coming in well below 
expectations," said Douglas j. 

Cliggon, a stock market strategist 
for J.P. Morgan, pointing to a slow-
down in the rate of growth in fac-
tory orders for communications 
equipment and to Motorola's 
warning that profits from cellular 
telephone handsets will be disap-
pointing. 

"Here you have a product that is 
becoming ubiquitous, and yet a 
leading company is having trou-
ble," he said. 

Motorola, traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange, is down $35 
to $116 in the two days since it 
issued its profit warning. 

On Thesday, Microsoft fell $4.50 
to $79.375, trading at its lowest level 
since June, after Richard Sherlund, 
an analyst for Goldman and Sachs 
warned that a slowdown in person-
al computer sales was affecting 
Microsoft's revenues.

of nine judges. 

The terse announcement left 
unclear whether the judges had 
decided that the government does 
not have the right to hold hosta~es 
in general. or whether their ruling 
appl!ed only ~o hostages who do 
not pose a clear and present danger 
to the state. 

The court's decision said that 
Israeli law on administrative deten-
tion does not grant the Defense 
Ministry the right to hold hostages. 
The decision was written by the 
coun's chief judge, Aaron Barak, 
who had wrinen the earlier ruling 
in 1997 upholding the detention of 
the hostages.

has not come at a time when all 
stocks are being pummeled. 
lnstead, this has been a case of the 
last becoming first, almost 
overnight. and vice versa. Bed Bath 
& Beyond, a retailer, was one of the 
worst performing stocks in the 
Nasdaq 100 from the end of 1999 
through the Nasdaq peak on 
March 10. It is the best performer 
since then. Network Appliance, a 
maker of computer servers, was 
one of the best performers early in 
the year, but has lost about half its 
value since then. 

The pain of this bear market is 
also less pronounced because 
Nasdaq had' run up so far, so fast, 
before it began to slide. As a result, 
only those who got in very recently 
have substantial cash losses.

Battle for Diversity 
at UCSD is Not Over 

UCSD has a mere three weeks left to 
convince more underrepresented minority 
candidates to come to this campus. 

For the first year since the elimination of 
affirmative action, the number of underrep-
resented minorities admi tted to this campus 
has risen. While the Guardian finds these 
numbers encouraging, we also realize that 
many of the students admitted to UCSD are 
also being courted by other universities. 

The average grade point average of stu-
dents admitted this year is 4.07, up from last 
year's record of 4.05. This means that the 
students admitted to UCSD this year are 
extremely well-qualified. It is also a sign that 
UCSD's populari ty is rising. At the same 
time, this means that many of the students 
admitted are qualified enough to be admitted 
to bigger-name schools such as Harvard, 
Stanford, UCLA and UC Berkeley. Between 
now and May 1, many students will be 
choosing between UCSD and these other 
schools. While UCSD is a fine academic 
institution in a city with a beautiful climate, 
many students, if given the opportunity, 
would probably choose Harvard over UCSD. 
. If this campus is serious about diversity, 
It must make a concerted effort to court 
underrepresented students. First and fore-
most, schoLarship money must be 
increased. The chancellor has already made 
a commitment to that cause. In his to-point 
diversity action plan, Dynes set a goal of 
reaching $1 million in annual undergradu-
ate scholarships by 2002. He has been suc-
cessful so far and we hope that he continues 
to follow .t~rough . Finances are often a pri-
mary decldmg factor for students choosing 
a college. By offering more scholarship 
funds, we can make this campus more 
desirable to students. 

In addition, the chancellor should 
increase funding for programs such as 
O.A.S.I.S. and Summerbridge. The student 
subcommittee of the diversity council rec-
ommended to Dynes that he increase fund-
ing for the programs and make those allo-
ca~ions permanent. Unfortunately, Dynes 
said he was unable to do so. We believe that 
these programs are important in retaining 
underrepresented students on this campus 
and therefore deserve increased funding. 

The admissions numbers seen last week 
are significant, but only a small step in the 
fight to make UCSD a more diverse cam-
pus. Each time diversity decreases, we not 
only lose numbers of underrepresented stu-
dents, we also make this campus less desir-
able for incoming students of color. The 
Guardian hopes that the administration 
increases its efforts to bring students of 
color to UCSD and keep them here.

campaign Finance Reform is Not a 
Solution to Political Bribery in America 
Politica~ candidate~ are clamoring for reforms in political fund-raising, but they are not 
addressmg the senous c~ that many citizens have with the political process 
., IIIINf DON 
Opinion Editor 

Officials on every Icvd of government 
arc frequently investigated for campaign 
finance violations in this country - from 
President Clinton being investigated for 
alleged contributions from Chinese 
nationals. to California state Insurance 
Commissioner Charles Quackenbush 
being investigated for alleged contribu-
tions made by insurance companies that 
arc up for review before the commissioner. 

Everyone is talking about campaign 
finance refonn, especially the leading 
presidential candidates AI Gore and 
~eorge ~ Bush, but no one is really say-
109 anythmg that addresses the practical 
problems perceived by the American 
public. The candidates say that they are 
for reform but arc loathe to outline any 
specific plans. They are also afraid to 

~ndidly discuss the real root of the 
pro.blem for fear of drawing attention to 
thell' own fund-raising activities. 

Most candidates' plans for campaign 
finance reform include restructuring the 
current donation limits. This does not 
address a major problem in American 
politics. lime and again election resl!lts 
have shown that the candidate who 
spends the most money does not neces-
sarily win. It is true thit there is a mini-
mum amount of money required to run 
a viable campaign, but after a cenain 
point, .pouring a~~itional money into 
c~rn'p~lg~ advenlsmg stans to yield 
dlmmlshmg returns. This was most 
recently illustrated in San Diego's own 
mayoral primary election, where the can-
didate who spent the most on his cam-
paign, Peter Q. Davis, came in third. 

Current contribution limits are 
absolutely unrealistic and merely force 

candi~t~ to p~~e methods of evading 
these bmlts. IndiVidual contributions U1 
pali.tical campaigns wen: limited to $1,000 
dunng the Nixon era and haven't been 
updated for inflation since that time. This 

The real concern on the minds 
of the American people, the 
word that no political 
candidate would dare 1lJ utter, 
is not "campaign finance, " but 
rather "bribery. " 
is simply not enough money to run a 
political campaign anymore. so the politi-
cal parties expanded their reliance on soft 
money contributions. political action 
comm~tte~ ~d ~ host of other shady 
campaign mstltutlons that the American 
public is fed up with. 

The real concern on the minds of the 
~merica~ people, the word that no polit-
Ical candidate would dare to utter, is not 
Mcampaign. financc," but rather "bribery." 

C~mpalgn contributions originally 
were mtended to be a logical extension of 
dem~racy in . a capitalist society: the 
candidates . With the widest suppon 
would receive the most contributions 
and be able to finance their campaigns 
through to the end. 

Today, campaign finance is no longer 
about funding campaigns for the big 
contributors: it is about the lobbying that 
follows the campaign. Individuals and 
interest groups are looking to get a toe in 
a governmental official's door, buying 
their way into their good graces with 
campaign contributions so that they can 
call in favors at a later date. Campai~ns 
arc now irrevocably tied to the political 
lobbying that follows them. 

Most recently, Microsoft has hired a 
former member of George W. Bush cam-
paign to lobby for Bush to suppon the 
software giant in its anti-trust case in the 
Deranment of justice. The election is 
stil seven months away and the next 
president is far from decided, but still 
corporate lobbyists are hard at work. The 
really rich companies always plan for the 
long run. 

Most major corpontions that make 
campaign contributions donate to both 
pa~~ duri~g ca~paigns. A trusting 
mdlVldual mIght ..give these companies 
the benefit of the aoubt and suppose that 
they are men:1y donating to both sides to 
reflect the diverse interests of their 
cmP~; after all, it is unlikely that 
every Single employee would unani-

mous~ suppon just one political pany. It 
docsn t take a deeply jaded individual to 
realize that this scenario is unlikely, how-
ever. The real reason is that these corpo-
rat~ons are making sure that they can 
claim they supponed whichever party 
wins the election when they come: a-lob-

~n~ much like a roul~tte p.laycr hedg-
109 his bets by spreadmg hiS chips all 
over the table. they won't all be winners, 
but the odds arc the sman gambler will 
still come out ahead. 

A study conducted by the Campaign 
Study Group showed that, between 1 997 
and 1998, many corporations - includ-
ing Philip . Morris, AT&T, UPS, RJR 
Nabisco, BcIlSouth, Lockheed Manin, 
Federal Express and Ernst & Young -
contributed hundreds of thousands of 

doll~ in .soft money to both political 
parties. nus year, Ernst & Young is one 
of the top five contributors to both the 
Bush an.d ~e Gore campaigns. 

SpeCial mterest groups likewise con-
tributed hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars to both the Democratic and 

Repu~li~an pa~ies, including the 
ASSOCiation of Thai Lawyers of America, 
the National Association of Home 
Builders, the American Bankers 
Association, the American Medical 
Association, the National Automobile 
Dealers Association and, of course, the 
National Rifle Association. All of these 
groups make a point to remind govern-

m~nt officials of their imponant cam-
paign suppon when they approach them 
to discuss their political interests.

College Elections Require Responsibility 
Even in university student council elections, deciding who to vote for often 
degenerates into a mere popularity contest for uninfo:med voters 
., AMalU CAIIIIIIR 
Columnist 

Today the voting booths come 
to a close and the mobs of stu-
dents actively logging on to 
Studentlink to vote for their 
favorite A.S. candidates will take a 
break. After today, the results will 
be final. Positions will have betn 
filled by satisfied winners and the 
others will return home rather 
disappointed. It will be interesting 
to sec what a difference the ability 
to vote on-line makes for voter 
turnout, since many students are 
stationed in front of the computer 
for good portions of the day and 
night. 

What dctcnnincs the winner in 
a contest of this son? It is a serious 
maner, but at the same time it is not 
that serious. Running for positions 
on the AS. Councilor individual 

~ councils taItcs courage in 
this harsh and often very aitical 
environment. 

In the college environment, the 
question is: What dctcnnines who 
the winners will be? The sample 
ballot isn't -exactly a novel and 
could be breezed through in a few 
minutes, depending on how long 
students take to gawk at the pho-

~phs of the candidates. But 
wait - photographs? 

lbat definitely must play some 
son of role in the outcome. 

As shallow as it may seem, 
appearances make a considerable 
difference. It is true that we are 
in an institution of learning that 
is based upon the ideas and work 
of peorle regardless of their 
physica appearances, but that 
human instinct for the most aes-
thetically pleasing still remains. 

What they have 1lJ say 
may be idealistic and 
occasionally siUy, but at 
least this way one can 
maJre a choice from the 
evidence of past excellence 
and future goals. A visit 
to a candidate's Mb site 
may even be the 
determining factor, since 
many of the candidates 
decided 1lJ go ryber with 
their campaign. 
Studies in psychology reveal that 
people tend to associate more 
noble characteristics with good-
looking people rather than with 
average or not-so-attractive peo-
ple. And although the image of a 
candidate may not be the deter-
mining factor in winning the 
vote, it is highly likely that at 
some point it crosses students' 
minds. 

Then again, realizing that the 
person who wins will not be seen 
very often, the voters' attention 
begins to focus on the little state-
ments next to their pictures in the 
-sample ballot. If one takes the 
time to read each of these individ-
ually, then there is a more sub-
stantial reason for the choice than 
just the picture. What they have to 
say may be idealistic and occa-
sionally silly, but at least one can 
make a choice from the evidence 
of past excellence and future 

goals. Even a visit to a candidate's 
Web site may be the determining 
factor, since many of the candi-
dates decidm to go ' cybcr with 
their campaign. 

However, there will still be 
people who don't have the time or 
don't take the time to look over 
such resources and simply follow 
a predetennined choice made by 
someone elsc. 

Maybe some liked the look of 
the "Vote Independent" t-shins 
and decided to go with the slate. 
Or possibly they were flipping 
throu$h the trusty Monday edi-
tion of the GUQTdian and figured 
that it would be safe to follow the 
newspaper's picks. Like all elec-
tions, then: will be the pressure of 
conformity by the masses. which 
could be the reason why one per-
son will win over another. 

So students cast their vote in 
the ocean of A.S. Council and 
will soon know if the catch is 
good or bad. But in the end, is it 
anything more than a popularity 
contest? Will the winners follow 
through with their enthusiastic 
and ambitious plans? Is a chan$e 
truly going to take place, or Will 
the system remain as it was 
before? It's likely that after all 
the hype dies down and the 
posters get stolen by the wind, 
there won't be a second thought 
to any of this. . 

Although that may be true, it 
is no reason to bail out and not to 
be a pan of this event. By taking 
the few moments to vote intelli-
gently, you at least show some 
concern for the campus. If you 
aren't pan of the solution, you are 
pan of the problem.

OPINION 5 

Microsoft Will Continue to 
Dominate Even if Split 
Dividing the company into operating system and 
application divisions will not affect its monopoly 
., NICHOLAS IIOZNOVSKY 
Texas A&M University 

(U-WIRE) COLLEGE STA-
TION, Texas - Last week, U.S. 
District judge Thomas jackson 
found that Microsoft, everyone's 
favorite corporation to hate, was 
guilty of abusing its position in 
the personal computing business 
and using unfair tactics to main-
tain its advantage in the field. 
jackson's 43-page ruling follows 
another issued by him last year 
saying that Microsoft applied 
undue pressure on its competitors 
in an attempt to stifle their prod-
uct development. 

Although it will probably 
appeal the judge's findings, 
Microsoft was basically found 
guilty of violating the Sherman 
Anti-Trust Act. The same legisla-
tion that broke up john D. 
Rockefeller's Standard Oil and 
created the Baby Bells now threat-
ens to do the same to the techno-
empire of Bill ·Gates. Whether or 
not Microsoft is divided into 
smaller companies, it is ceruin 
the company will face some son 
of sanctions for its behavior. 

But what does that mean for 
the average American? Absolutely 
nothing. 

If history is a guide as to what 
will happen in the Microsoft 
affair, not much will change for 
the common computer user. 
Splitting Microsoft into several 
companies will just allow it to 
contmue its market dominance 
under the guise of legality and 

fairness in two separate entities -
one continuing to develop and 
market operating systems, while 
the other would be limited to the 
realm of software applications. 

The prospect of the split failed 
to earn any rounds of applause 
from Microsoft's competitors. Is 
there any real chance that a 
Microsoft offspring devoted 
entirely to application develop-
ment would not cater to the 
Windows operat ing system? 
Microsoft's successful competi-
tors do. Even the competitors 
admit that due to the market 
dominance of Windows, creating 
applications to run on those plat-
forms is the only way to stay in 
business. 

So in the end , the current 
Microsoft strategy of creating 
programs to run on its operating 
system will remain intact, even if 
the software has to come from an 
office in Boise, Idaho instead of 
Seattle. The only real difference 
the average computer user might 
notice is a hit in the pocketbook 
- unable to bundle the programs 
with the operating system like it 
does now, Microsoft would have 
to charge for them separately. 

And do not fo rget that many of 
the companies that Microsoft has 
been accused of victimizing have 
only risen to prominence due to 
their associations wi th Microsoft. 
Having made it to the big league, 
they now also want to be able to 
make or break the emerging tech-

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Students Who Appeal Grades Have Options 
Editor: 
I am writing in response to the 

editorial titled "Grade Appeals 
Need Reform" (April 6,2000). I am 
happy to see that you chose to dis-
cuss the grade change process, an 
academic policy issue that seems to 
concern numerous students on our 
campus. You listed some of the dif-
ficulties that students face in an 
attempt to change a grade and then 
recommended a review of the 
process. As the only candidate for 
Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
in the upcoming ASUCSD elec-
tions, if all goes well, I hope soon to 
be elected into this position . 
Therefore, I - and hopefully other 
members of the Academic Senate 
- took note of the recommenda-
tion for a review. I will look into 
this to determine whether and how 
the grade change process can be 
made easier and more efficient. (n 
the meantime, here are some rec-
ommendations that may alleviate 
the difficulties that were addressed 
in the editorial. 

1. There are several ways to 
track down a professor. The most 
efficien t way seems to be through 
e-mail. Not only will this allow the 
student to make an appointment so 
as to avoid busy or inconsistent 
office hours, but it will also ease the 
process for the students who have

had no previous interaction with, 
or feel intimidated by the professor. 

2. If the professor seems hesi-
tant or not welcoming of grade 
changes altogether, there already 
exists a third party that the stu-

dents can approach for a grade 
change. Although they may not be 
entirely "unbiased: I was informed 
that the department chairs have the 
responsibility of reviewing our 
requests. 

3. Lastly, it's important to keep 
your own records of grades and 
communiques. 

I hope that the information 
above will be helpful. We often 
rush to appeal grades at the begin-
ning of the quarter but it is good to 
note that we have one calendar 
year from the time they were 
recorded to appeal our grades. This 
gives us plenty of time to tackle the 
challenges of the grade appeals 
process. Students can get specific 
guidelines from their college coun-
selors, departments or academic 
affairs office. I am really not sure 
what kinds of changes will be made 
in the grade change policies in the 
near future, but 1 do know that, as 
students, the way we choose to 
approach this process can make a 
difference in the effectiveness of 
our request. Good luck to those 
students faced with the uphill 
grade appeals process and thanks 
to the editorial board-for bringing 
this issue to our attention.

Corporations and lobbying

Effective campaign finance 
reform must address the con-

prevent campaign contributions 
from becoming a form of bribery, 
all campaign contributions

Contributions would first be sub-

Commission, who would then 
distribute an appropriate amount 
of funds to the individual cam-

the original contributors were. 
This would also simplify the audit 
process by allowing the FEC to 
evaluate possible violations 
before any contribution money

rather than the current system, 
where investigators have to hunt 
down all the information after the

tions prevent any . ~edia ag~ncy 
from favoring a pohocal candIdate 
by giving him or her more cover-
age than another candidate. Thi~ is 
a practical approach to campaIgn 
reform, much more so than the 
contribution limits that have been 
effectively circumvented by soft 
money contributions. 

Media reforms can be expand-
ed by limiting the amount of 
commercial advertising that can-
didates can purchase. Candidate 
profiles published in federally 
funded campaign brochures and 
televised candidate debates and 
forums broadcast on public 
channels such as C-SPAN will 
make campaigns' cheaper and 
reduce the need for enormous 
campaign contributions. 

Most politicians who talk 
about campaign finance reform 
talk about it in term~ that they are 
used to: spending limits, contri-
bution limits and soft money 
curbs. These issues are not what 
the American people are con-
cerned with. The American peo-
ple are concerned that their lead-
ers are being bought with large 
campaign contrioutions. Any 
reforms that are to meet with 
popular support must acknowl-
edge this fact and move to reme-
dy the problem.

tions manager, said that the 
campaign season has gone 
smoothly, with only minor com-
plaints being reported, most of 
them due to posting policy vio-
lations. She said that so far, the 
candidates have been able to 
work out problems on their 
own. 

Davis added that the lack of 
competing slates is making this 
election run more smoothly. In 
years past, there has sometimes 
been a battle between two com-

peting slates. 
"Since there's only one 

Islate! this year, that changes the 
whole tone of the campaign,~ 
she said. "We haven't witnessed 
the hardcore campaigning of 
the past." 

Davis said that while there 
will be an assessment of online 
voting once the elections are 
complete, she believes it should 
continue even if there is not a 
significant increase in voter 
turnout. 

"It should continue because 
it's cutting edge and it's really 
new: she said. "People will get 
more and more used to it. It's 
definitely something we· should 
keep." 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
said that he is also in favor of 
continuing online voting. 

"[ like online voting, but [ feel 
it is going to take a couple of 
years for students to get used to 
it; he stated. "[ do believe that 
there always needs to be a phys-
ical place to vote such as Library 
Walk. [n fact, my recommenda-
tion for next year is to have more 
than one on-campus terminal 
voting center: 

Elections results will be 
released at Round Table Pizza in 
the Price Center at 4:30 p.m. 
Thursday and will be availab[e 
online at stutkntlinlt.ucsd.edu after 
6 p.m.

A.S. vice president external. "He has 
awesome responsibilities because 
he has the opportunity to put items 
on the regents' agenda to discuss: 

Patterson said that only regents 
are allowed to submit an item to 
be discussed at these meetings. 
The student regent's duty is to 
work to the advantage of the stu-
dents of the University of 
California. 

"This is good for us because it 
gives us a voice on the board, and 
it gives us the opportunity to get 
items on the agenda; he said. 

According to Khullar, becom-
ing the student regent is very diffi-
cult due to its selective process 
and demanding qualifications. 

"(You need to have) great inter-
personal skills, be informed on all 
UC issues, an agenda of issues that 
match [the University of 
California Student Association) 
and the UC presidents, an open 
mind, yet [bel strong-minded to 
stand up to the regents on student 
issues and lastly, the ability to 
articulate points in Ian under-
standable) fashion; Khullar said. 

The Board of Regents nar-
rowed i~ selection to a group of 

nine, including two students from 
UCSD, before finally deciding on 
Fong. 

Khullar said Fong was chosen 
d ue to his credentials and experi-
ence. , 

"He came very prepared with a 
packet of information; Khullar 
said. "He had experience working 
on a diverse variety of issues and 
was extremely articulate: 

Fong, who replaces UC 
Berkeley undergraduate Michelle 
Pan nor as student regent, was 
appointed on March 17 and will 
begin work on July 1. 

He received his undergraduate 
degree in environmental studies at 
UC Berkeley and is now working 
toward a graduate degree in public 
policy. 

Fong's term lasts for one year. 
The board is currently in the 
process of appointing a new 
"shadow regent~ to replace Fong 
for the 2001 school year. 

[n addition to the voting power 
on the board of regents, Fong will 
receive free tuition for the next 
two years and free parking on all 
the UC campuses. 

According to Khullar, Fong will 
merit these perks if he bnngs to 
the students what Khullar expects.

student regent in the arena of 
diversity; he said. "This is great

Painting: 
simoff filed a police 
report ~dnesday 

through Roma even after we are 
closed, despite the doors being 
blocked. Someone probably took 
the painting as an April Fool's prank, 
or it was stolen by. someone who 
called her up, wanted to buy it from 
her, and she didn't sell it to them: 

Valadez added that the painting 
was within reach on a wall in Roma 
and the event surprised her, since 
nothing had ever been stolen in the 
10 years that she has worked at 
Roma. 

Simoff, who painted the piece for 
a visual arts class. said she Jast saw 
her painting hanging in Roma dur-
ing finals week of winter quarter. 

Simoffs piece was painted with 
acrylic paints on a 30~ by 24~ can-
vas. The composition consisted of 
three goldfish, one of which was in 
a wine glass in the center of the 
painting. The other two fish were 
floating in space on opposite sides 
of the glass. The background of the 
painting consisted of overlapping 
spheres in various coTors. Some of 
the spheres, as well as the fish and 
the glass, were outlined in silver. 

Simoff spent three weeks paint-
ing her piece and wants the piece 
back because it is crucial to her 
portfolio. 

"I guess someone stole my 
painting because they liked it and 
didn't want to pay for it; she said. 
"There were several offers to buy 
my painting, but I was unwilling 
to sell it because [ liked it so 
much . There are no leads yet, but 
[ would really like it back because 
[ have no photographs of it for my 
portfolio: 

David Chatsuthiphan, a friend 
of Simoff and a fellow Muir senior, 
said Simoff loved her painting and 
that he understands her frustration 
and sadness. . 

"It's part of her portfolio that 
she needs, and now she doesn 't get 
the chance to put it in,~ he said. 
"It's hard to reproduce paintings 
because you're just not as into it 
the second time around, and it 
doesn't mean as much . The whole 
situation is just stupid because if a 
student has it, then they can't put it 
up anywhere because they will get 
caught. [ don't understand it: 

Simoff filed a police report 
Wednesday but said that she feels 
she will probably never get the 
painting back. 

Valadez said that in the future 
she will definitely inform students 
about Simoffs incident if they wish 
to hang their paintings in Roma. 
She said that students who wish to 
display their artwork will do so at 
their own risk. 

Simoff said she is upset about 
the incident. 

"This whole incident kind of 
changes the way I feel about peo-
ple: she said. "What gives some-
one the right to take something 
that isn't theirs to take, especially if 
it is something that has no mone-
tary value?" 

Any information leading to the 
painting's whereabouts can be 
reported anonymously to the 
UCSD police at 534-4357, or to 
Staci Simoff at (619) 295-5863 or

Avenida Revolucion 
A leisurely stroll through TijuanaS infamous street reveals shopping, dancing, drugs and more 

No doubt, Mexico and the United States have a live-ly (if sometimes contentious) history in the exchange of peoples, goods and cultures. The busiest international border in the world is just 
south of San Diego at the Tijuana/San Ysidro Port of Entry, 
where 33 million crossings occur annually. Twenty-one 
thousand pedestrians pass through on foot every day and 
thousands of them are headed for Avenida Revoluci6n, a 
wild and exciting street that symbolizes the border itself. 

The famous Avenida Revoluci6n takes its name from a 
period of Mexican history commonly referred to as the 
"Mexican Revolution; which is no small misnomer. In fact, 
the "Mexican Revolution" was a series of many revolutions 
over a period of 30 years, from 1910 to 1940. Since then a 
single party has dominated Mexico's so-called democracy, 
resulting in a kind of half-baked dictatorship. A third-world 
economy where everything is for sale, of which Avenida Rev-
0luci6n is an example. reveals the unevenness of the one-

party Mexican government. ... 
Avenida Revoluci6n runs across the City of TIJuana, 

beginning near the San Ysidro bo~der on the south .side of 
the Tijuana River. Each street that Intersects the aventda has 
two names. One name is numerical, such as "First Street: 
Second names are taken from historical figures of the Mex-
ican revolutions, such as Emiliano Zapata and Benito 
Juarez. Sections of Avenida Revolucion seem as chaotic as 
the revolutionary years from which the street takes its name, 
especially the half of the avenida nearest to the border. All . 
the action takes place on this stretc~ of pavement, se~en 
bustling blocks within easy walking distance of the Untted 
States. 

Avenida Revoluci6n begins with the Santa Cecilia Plaza, 
a cobblestone courtyard surrounded by restaurants and 
shops. The plaza and Jhe foot of the avenida are about a

Fusion 2K Brings It All Together 
MASA kicks ojJits first annual hip hop dance competition with flying colors 
Iy JACQUELIN! CMUNG 
Staff Writer 

On Saturday, April 8 the Multi-
Asian Student Association , in 
conjunction with the hip-hop 
dance team 220 ("Second to 
None"), presented a dynamic and 
explosive showcase of hip-hop 
dance groups in its first annual 
dance competition, Fusion 2000. 

This exciting extravaganza fea -
tured five competing troupes 
along with 10 exhibition groups 
performing everything from pro-
fessional hip hop to japanese taiko 
drums. The competition aspect 
exhibited the multifaceted talent 
of teams from various San Diego 
and L.A. groups. Fusion 2000 fea-
tured competltors 909 from UC 
Riverside, Formality from San 
Diego State University, Kaba 
Modern from UC Irvine, DVS 
from U~LA and Team Millenia

evening with parody acts of Tom

Following the humorous intro-
duction, the show plowed forward 
with an exhirarating opening per-
formance by the young dancing 
exhibition troupe Future Shock, 
an incredible team featuring 
dancers under age 17. This unique 
team set the stage for the variety of 
performances that were to come. 

The first batch of competing 
teams, Formality and 909, were 
quick to electrify the crowd with 
exuberant routines that used black 
lights and a vast array of musical 
genres. The San Diego Chinese 
Academy, a group of young female 
dancers, delivered an . enchanting 
and graceful performance com-
plete with Chinese parasols. 
UCLA's Kyodo Taiko, with a guest 
solo performance by MASA's Erin

rhythmic beatings of traditional 
japanese drums.

word was exhibited by Veejay and 
Dudley jennings, recent winners 
of the Asian Pacific Student Asso-
ciation talent contest. Their well-
versed and articulate performance 
underscored the multicultural 
awareness that was the theme of 
the entire show.' 

Host dance team 220 delivered 
a creative and lively performance 
in the debut of its new "alien" rou-
tine. DVS staged the winning per-
formance by utilizing swivel chairs 
in its ertergetic routine that 
included a rap performance. Kaba 
Modern, which may have dis-
played the most energy of all the 
teams in attendance, was awarded 

a second-place finish for its 
smooth moves to '80s grooves. 
Team Millenia's third-place per-
formance featured one of the most 
memorable moments of the 
evening when all 25 members of 
the team tossed glow sticks into 
the crowd. 

Cultureshock - widely regard-
ed as one of the best dance 
troupes in southern California -
finished the show with a spectacu-
lar performance that included 
some bodacious break dancing. 

There were also two acts per-
formed by members and friends of 
MASA. The dance routine "Kun-
Fusion" awed the crowd with, if 
not the cleanest moves of the 
evening, a sassy attitude. 

MASA's "Wall Skit" was a the-
atrical exhibition of the entire 
MASA mission. In the skit, two 
people separated by the barriers 
that stand between all those 
whose backgrounds vary 'were 
brought together while the wall 
between them was kicked down by 
MASA members. 

Fusion 2000 provided a fun 

HIATUS 11 

and entertamlng evening while 
adhering to MASA's dream of 
uniting people in the celebra tion 
of cultural diversity. 

As a first-year student organi-
za tion , MASA strives to be 
involved in cultural, social, com-
munity and academic projects that 
benefit its members, campus and 
community. As MASA strives to 
celebrate Asian-American bicul-
turality, it also works to break bar-
riers between different cultures, to 
take an active role in eliminating 
stereotypes and to provide a com-
fortable and fun atmosphere in 
which members can interact. 

Fusion 2000 succeeded in its 
goal of celebrating unity, diversity 
and understanding by bringing 
together a sold-out crowd and 
exposing it to both traditional and 
modern performances by a group 
of performers whose backgrounds 
were as varied as their ta lents. 

Those interested in further 
MASA events can check out the 
MASA general body meeting this 
Thursday in the Price Center Cove 
at 7 p.m.

Supergrass 

-
-B+ 

Did you know that Oxford, England 
offers more to the music world than the 
amazing band Radiohead? 

Many do not know about Supcrgrass. 
who also call Oxford their home and are 
very popular in the United Kingdom for 
their light-hearted music. 

If you are bold enough, buy their third 
album, the self-titled Suptrgrass. On it, you 
will hear Gaz Coombes' voice and guitar 
kicking off the party. Mick Quinn pro-
vides the bassline and Roben Coombes 
provides the piano work that will make 
you want to get up and dance. Danny 
Goffey keeps the time and will keep you 
on your feet . 

Supcrgrass is not hailed as the next 
group to break onto the U.S. airwaves. They 
aren't the new saviors of Brit-pop. Many 
Americans - so consumed with their rap 
metal or pimp metal or whatever - will not 
rush to buy their most recent album. 

However. if you like the sweet melodies 
and lush guitars of Brit-pop, buy this album 
and use the happy sounds of Supergrass to 
drown out that damn EiffC:\ 65 song coming 
from next door. 

Supergrass is notorious for their incredi-
bly happy melodies. but their newest album 
deals more with the pain and suffering in 
life. They haven't quite found that yet. and 

that's not bad at all. 
The music continues to be happy and 

bouncy and even their attempts at minor 
chords and slower ballads end up sounding 
like a walk in the- park. 

Ultimately. this creates a wonderful com-
bination of deeper and darker lyrics 
splashed all over with that happy Supergrass 
sound. 

"Born Againn tries to bring a cold. mel-
low feel with a distant guitar riff and a dark 
keyboard pan underneath. Even with the 
beautiful harmonies that melt into each 
other while Coombes sings "whatever you 
want is all right, n this is about as close to a 
love song as they get. 

Songs like "Farawa( and "Moving" try 
to stan an emotional acoustic ballad, but the 
energy and the groove that jU!'1p-start these 
songs are inevitable. 

"Moving" has Coombes' voice floating 
on the wings of lush orchestral sweeps. but 
after a minute into the song, the drums kick 
in accompanied by a driving piano riff and a 
moving bassline that make you want to $et 
in a car and drive down the open road with 
the wind in your hair as Coombes urges: 
"Moving. just keep moving." 

"What Went Wrong (In Your Head)" is a 
song with thick, dark undertones with a 
pounding piano as Gaz wails, ". need some 
salvation ... God save the unstable." 

Supergrass recently released "Pumping 
on Your Stereo" as a single and MTV has 
picked up the video for it. If you wait long 
enough. watching "After Hours" for a while 
and just before "Dawn Patrol." you'll see our 
beloved lads in massive muppet-like cos-
tumes playing instruments on a set straight 
from Jim Henson's studio. 

If the refreshingly simple and amusing 
visuals weren't enough. God forbid they 
accompany that with a fantastic hand-
clapping, foot-stomping bar song. Com-
plete with an incredible groove and a cho-
rus laced with a fabulous piano arrange-
ment. "Pumping On Your Stereo" seems 
to come straight from a jazz musician 
playing the upright in the corner of the 
room. 

With the edgy Richard Ashcroft-esque 
vocals of Gaz. it's enough to take you from

ried by one pair of legs. After some slight 
hesitation. the woman jumped onto an 
already balancing sculpture of two 
dancers. landing as requested on the back 
of O·Brien . The other two volunteers were 
lifted onto his back in front of her and the 
last person. Horowitz. scooted between 
the single pair of strong legs to be lifted by 
his panners and the "oohs· and Maahs" of 
the audience. 

Such sounds were heard frequently 
throughout the performance as the trio 
moved from one astonishing pose to anoth-
er. malting a series of wondrous human 
sculptures. In the first piece. "From the 
Depths; the intriguing bald figure of 
O'Brien became a pendulum. lit by magen-
ta dots of swirling light. The distance he 
swung back and fonh between his suppon-
ing panners increased until the last swing 
lifted him smoothly up and over the back of 
one dancer and. consequently, into a new 
shape. This type of seamless transition 
between the athletically balanced sculptures 
and clean lifts continued throughout the 
show. 

Another strong element. the trio's great 
sense of humor brought hearty laughter. 
Afraid neither of the absurd nor of making 
weird sounds on stage. they thre~ seeming~ 
Iy random vocalizations and quirky move-
ments into the choreography of certain 
pieces. There were several pieces where the 
three used their voices in addition to or 
instead of taped music as background such 
as the brief "Fum; named for the sound 
they make. 

The group can be labeled "post-modem" 
from its technique and absurd sense of 
humor to its democratic approach to dance. 
There is no director. the three collaborate 
equally in developing the dances and make 
all decisions by consensus. All parties have 
to like a dance for it to become pan of the 
group's repenory.

those traveling on foot stay to the

to Avenida Revolucion include 
Mexican taxicabs (which are always 
available and generally cost about 
$S per passenger), and tour buses, 
which leave from the United States 
side of the border ar.d cost just $1

Some of Avenida Revoluci6n's 
street vendors also· sell food, such 
as sweet steamed com and bacon-
wrapped hot dogs. Both the hot 
dogs and the com cost S1, but the 
com is much easier on your diges-
tive system. Other salespeople offer 
cold fruit drinks and fresh fruit 
such as melons and strawberries. 
Although it is common to bargain 
for better deals when shopping in 
Tijuana, it is not proper to negoti-
ate with anyone selling food. 
Whether you're in a nice Mexican 
restaurant or a shabby taco booth, 
the prices are fIXed. Any food on 
Revolucion is safe to eat. Tap water 
should be avoided, but mixed 
drinks and ice cubes are safe. 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, Apri113, 2000 

Alel/~ 

Upon visiting Avenida Revolu-
cion, the main attractions of the 
street become apparent; the first 
block alone holds 16 boutiques, 
four cantinas, two huge dance 
clubs, two outdoor shopping malls, 
two pharmacies. three restaurants, 
one bank and one hotel. The 
densely packed seven-block strip 
contains at least eight huge dance 
clubs, several museums, dozens of 
cantinas and hundreds of bou-
tiques. People visit this place for 
two reasons; first, they come to 
shop. Second, they come to party. 

Aside from outdoor vendors 
who sell their wares from tables 
and booths, Avenida Revoluci6n is 
home to an amazing number of 
indoor boutiques; one packed 
block houses 36 of these establish-
ments. Here, bargaining is the rule. 
One should never pay the first 
price quoted by the salesperson. 
Instead, suggest a slightly lower 
price and attempt to reach a com-
promise. Many of the shops have 
only domestically produced items 
such as leather goods, artwork, 
Mexican-style clothes and hand-
made jewelry. Some sell things that 
are ilIC$al or difficulf to obtain in 
the Umted States, like switchblade 
knives, brass knuckles and bull 
whips. Think twice about purchas-
ing these items because they may 
be confiscated at the U.S. border.

Shopping on Avenida Revolu-
cion takes several fonns. On the 
street there are outdoor vendors 
who sell relatively small, inexpen-
sive items such as beaded necklaces 
($6), small clay Aztec statues ($4), 
Mexican cigarettes ($2) and super-
hero outfits for small children ($4). 
Bargaining is acceptable with these 
vendors who crowd the sidewalks 
and are in a constant price war with 
one another. All of them speak 
enough English to communicate 
with Americans. Sales are made 
from tables arranged on the street 
or the sidewalk and the selection of 
items for sale varies from day to 
day. 

Other boutiques on Revoluci6n 
are more upscale and offer brand-
name items that could be pur-
chased in the United States. 
Though there is less bargaining in 
these stores, prices are usually 
reduced by about 30 percent when 
compared to U. S. prices. There are 
several chain stores on the Avenida, 
including Guess and Quicksilver 
franchises. Other department 
stores offer perfume and cosmetics 
by major fashion labels such as 

pmon. 

Gucci, Chand, Calvin Klein, and so 
on. Warning; if you purchase more 
than $400 worth of goods in Mex-
ict>, you may have to pay taxes to 
U.S. Customs at the border. Other 
restrictions apply to items such as 
cigarettes and alcohol. 

Aside from street vendors and 
boutiques, Avenida RevoluciOn is 
home to an improbable number of 
small pharmacies called "fanna-
das; all of which seem to do very 
well. The reasons for prosperity are 
simple; both prescription and non-
prescription drugs are cheaper in 
Mexico than in the United States 
and in Mexico there is no prescrip-
tion system to regulate the sale of

Local Crew Flows Smooth Like Molasses 
Away from commercial bred music, Infinite Shades of Gray hit their fans with depth and insight 
By CHAKO IUZUKI something juxtaposed between the . 
By Staff Writer two. This is no group of goody-

goodies; their rough lives reinforce 
their idea that the individual cre-
ates his own evils and the individ-
ual makes gain from his experi-
ences. This is revealed in their 
lyrics. 

After listening to the debut 
album of local hip-hop crew Infi-
nite Shades of Gray, I had to sit 
back and take a deep breath. 

A refreshing step away from 
commercial-bred music, Infinite 
Shades of Gray hits its listeners 
with philosophical insight brought 
by vast experience - the album 
flows smoothly like molasses yet 
bites hard like reality. The beats are 
fresh, but not "as fresh and honest 
as the lyrics. 

Track 12, "Infinite Affiliates: is 
one that the group is very proud of, 
as it demonstrates how well the 
emcees collaborate their talents as 
well as the uniqueness of each 
individual's talents. Each line adds 
another purpose to what the song 
says as a w/ulle. 

When asked why the album is 
so serious, the members of the 
group bluntly responded, "That's 
how we think." Infinite Shades of 
Gray seems to be a great group of 
people who share an intellectual 
curiosity to look past the hype. 

Formed two years ago, Infinite 
Shades Of Gray is the convergence 
of seven emcees; Didactic (from 
UCSD), Tan Ph act, the Mage, 
ThaiMex, Haroon and Justlfeye. 
Their name comes from the diverse 
backgrounds they represent; they 
say their "differences create a beau-
tiful gumbo" because of their "will -
ingness to cooperate with their dif-
ferent styles." 

The group's members do not 
claim to be black or white in any 
sense of the argument, but rather, 

The emcees of Infinite Shades 
of Gray rose above their adversities 
with faith in life and music. Faith is 
a topic that the Mage focuses on -
he points out that his lyrics "point 
out my own shortcomings and 
other peoples' - everything else is 
bull." 

It is surprising to hear this seri-
ousness and straight-forward 
expression from someone 23 years 
of age. Listening to the Mage and 
their album is like stepping in'to 
their heads; their flow of- con-
sciousness can he applied and 
learned to each listener in a differ-
ent way. 

Infinite Shades of Gray also has 
strong opinions about hip hop 
music and San Diego's hip hop 
scene. The group is in agreement 
over its disenchantment of the 
genre, arguing that today's hip hop 
focuses on being rich rather than 
being happy. The members of Infi-
nite Shades of Gray are all tired of 
"jiggy" music, and feel that San 
Diego is overflowing with talent. 

"There is a lot of talent here." 
the Mage said, "but not many 
crews that want to put aside the 
bull and deal with the hip hop." In 
the future, they hope to colhfborate 
and see more collaborations with 
other groups and individuals.

Alex / Glwd,arl 
..........a.: Mexican pharmacies offer both prescription and nonprescription drugs over the (ounter. 
Matry Americans go down south for the cheaper pharmaceuticals whereas others have ulterior motives. 

Baja: 
Mexican police officers may offer 
Americans bags of pot 
roundings and you will be fine. 

One of the largest nightclubs on Avenida 
Revoluci6n is called Eclipse, a massive 
three-story space with several dance floors, 
an amazing light show and a deafening 
sound system. The site of Eclipse has been a 
cantina and club since the 19305, according 
to club employees. Like most of the large 
nightclubs on Revoluci6n, Eclipse has two-
for-one drinks every night, and all-you-can-
drink on Wednesday nights. On Wednes-
days the club has a $5 cover charge, but at 
all other times entrance is free. A night in 
spent in Tijuana dancing at a wild place like 
Eclipse can be a taste of debauchery, Mexi-
can style. 

Avenida Revoluci6n is home to eight or 
10 massive dance clubs like Eclipse. Club 
Safari and Mr. Crown are very popular, as is 
Club FX. These huge clubs are packed so 
close to one another on the street that you 

can look off the balcony of one club and see 
other light shows flashing down the block. 
Walking down Revoluci6n at night, music 
from one club follows until music from the 
next club becomes overpowering. The side-
walks are packed with young Americans and 
Mexicans who are out drinking and danc-
ing, and a good time is had by all . Even the 
small cantinas fill up. 

Only two suggestions are left to improve 
your vacation on Avenida Revoluci6n. One 
is: Avoid illegal drugs in Tijuana. Mexico has 
no laws against police entrapment. A Mexi-
can police officer will offer you a bag of pot, 
but if you accept it he will throw you in 
handcuffs and take you to jail. You would 
probably be released with a $50 fine, but 
your friends will be very worried. 

The second suggestion: Do not drive 
home from Tijuana drunk. On the U.S. side 
of the border, highway patrol officers wait 
for young revelers to come speeding north 
up Interstate Five. They will not hesitate to 
pull you over and give you a sobriety test. 
Avoid a costly DUI ticket by designating a 
driver or renting a hotel room on Revolu-
ci6n. Rooms within stumbling distance are 
cheap - less than $30 a night.

One Win~ One Loss 
for Women's Tennis 
Sweeping Pamona was a piece of cake, but 
Trinity College proves to be a tougher task 
., AlMND VAlAN 
Staff Writer 

The UC San Diego women's 
tennis team split two games this 
weekend, winning against 
Pomona Pitzer but falling to 
Trinity College from San 
Antonio. 

The game against 
Pomona Pitzer College 
showcased 
UCSD's talented 
team 

The Tritons 
kept Pomona 
unbalanced and came 
out victorious in every 
facet of the matches. This was 
their sixth 9-0 victory over a team. 
Previous wins came against 
Washington University, Rhodes 
College, Pacific Lutheran, 
University of Redlands and 
University of San Francisco. 

Before this match, the team 
faced a tough Trinity College team 
that had a record of 14-1, a mirror 
image of l:lC San Diego's record of 
13-1. 

Trinity is ranked No.1 in the 
Division III West Regional, with 
UCSD close behind at No. 2. This 
match had a national champi-
onship atmosphere; a team that 
the UCSD women's team will 
likely face late in the champi-
onships. 

UCSD won two of the first six 
singles matches, capped by sopho-
more Lyndsey Tadlock's victory 
over Laura Cumming, 6-2, 6-0. 

The first two singles matches 
ended in heartbreaking three-set 

losses by freshman Amy 
Tranckino and senior Yen Yen Ho. 
Trinity went on to take the match 
with an overall set score of 6-3. 
The loss prevents the UCSD team 
from gaining a higher seed in its 
region. 

"The Trinity match was to 
determine the No. 1 team in the 

region, which affects who 
we · play at Regionals: 

Head Coach Liz 
LaPlante said . 
"Trinity was very 
tough, but we had 
a very disappoint-

ing loss to them 6-3 . It 
was a match we could win, 

but they just had a better day. 
Losing at No.2 and No. 3 doubles 
I?oth 8-5 was tough, and then los-
ing at No.1 and No. 2 singles in the 
third set was disappointing as 
well." 

One bright pan of the match 
was the doubles play of Tranckino 
and Tadlock, who won their match 
8-2 over Lizzie Yasser and Amanda 
Browne. Their consistent play has 
given UCSD a boost on the dou-
bles side. 

"The victor\' at No. 1 doubles by 
Tranckino and Tadlock was great: 
laPlante said. "That will assure 
them as one of the top doubles 
teams in the country." 

Both matches were played at 
UCSD, which for the Trinity match 
was unusual. The women's team 
usually has to travel to Arizona to 
play the team from San Antonio, 
but this time around it had the

the mental and physial endurance

keyed up from their awesome victo-
ry and came out ready to play in the 
finals face-off against UC Davis. 

The Thton's knew this match 
would be difficult from the begin-
ning. They needed to reach deep and 
come up with an effort that exceed-
ed everything they had previously 
given in the tournament. 

Thcker, Smith, Angie Kondrat 
and Kudritzki rang up goals in the 
tournament-clinching victory. 
Hadiashar came up with a huge 
nine-save effort in the cage, keeping 
the Davis offense on lockdown and 
allowing the Thton offense to come 
through with the winning shots.

The liiton women are lacking

Softball Team Breezes Through Wins 
J:eea Harlan '5 no-hitter over Pomona is just one of four victories the Tritons have picked up recently 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD softbaU team looks 
to be unstoppable. The liitons 
continued to roll as they picked up 
four recent wins to improve their 
record to 20-5. 

·We're definitely not at our 
peak yet: UCSD Head Coach 
Patti Gerckens said. ·With each 
game, they learn more. Their con-
fidence is building. They know 
they have a lot of games to go." 

Last Wednesday, the Thtons 
played their first home game in 
three weeks. They beat Pomona-
Pitzer 8-0 in each of two games of 
a double-header and then downed 
La Verne 8-0 and 4-1 in two 
games on Sunday. 

·Pomona was not a very good 
team: Gerckens said, ·but we did-
n't play down to their level, which 
is good: 

In the first game of the double-
header, Thton Leta Harlan kept 
Pomona at bay as she tossed a six-
inning no-hitter. Harlan struck 
out seven frustrated batters and 
walked one en route to victory. 

·She .was just keeping them off 

balance: Gerckens said. ·She 
came up with a good win." 
. Offensively, UCSD's Michelle 
Wilson led the way by going 4-4 
with two runs scored and two 
RBIs. 

The game started slowly, and it 
wasn't until the third inning that the 
scoreboard lit up. The Thtons 

I~ three runs in the third on 
their way to the 8-0 mercy-short-
ened win. 

In the second game against 
Pomona, UCSD again had a 
strong pitching performance to 
open up room for its offense. 

Erin Flanigan picked. up the 
win for the Thtons after allowing 
only four hits. Harlan earned a 
save by strikin~ out three and not 
allowing a sin~.e hit. 

Harlan, Kristina Anderson and 
Erin Bridges earned their keep on 
the offensive side of the ball as 
they all drove in two runs apiece. 

UCSD did not let up against La 
Verne on Sunday in a double-head-
er. 

Harlan picked up another win in 
the first game of the set as she struck 
out seven batters and allowed only 
two hits. Her record now stands at 

7-2. Harlan helped her own cause 
by going 2-3 at the plate and driving 
in two runners. Wilson also was 2-3 
and knocked in one. 

It was an odd.contest. The two 
sides battled each other evenly for 
four and a naif innings. Then, in the 
bottom of the fifth, UCSD struck 
and La Verne coUapsed. 

·We started hitting the ball: 
Gerckens said. ·We made them 
make mistakes and they fell apart." 

The liitons scored eight runs 
on four hits and five La Verne 
errors in the fifth to force an end 
to the contest by way of the mercy 
rule. 

The 1titons used their 
momentum from the first game 
against La Verne to propel them-
selves to victory in the Second 
game of the double-header. 

UCSD knocked in four runs in 
the first inning alone and cruised 
to a 4-1 conquest. 

MicheUe Di Michieli was the 
liitons' spark in the contest. She 
drove in two runs in the first 
inning to lead her team to victory. 

·We were pumped up heading 
into the second game.. Gerckens 
said. "We should have scored more.· 

Flanigan picked up the win on 
the mound for UCSD. She strUck 
out three and allowed one hit. The 
win moves her record to 9-3. 

Stacey Bolaris came on in the 
sixth inning to clean up and pick 
up the save. 

Gerckens said the Tritons have 
grown as a team of late. 

"In Florida, they played well 
and they got to know each other: 
Gerckens explained. "The team 
knows how much the seniors 
want it. The team wants it. It 
comes from everybody. Everyone 
in the dugout gives 100 percent." 

The Tritons don't need to pack 
their bags anytime soon as they 
will continue to play at home. 

On Thursday, UCSD will com-
plete a game against Claremont 
that was called due to darkness. 

Then on Friday, UCSD kicks 
off the UC San Diego Power Bar 
Classic. Claremont, La Verne and 
Southwestern College look to be 
the next victims of the mtons. 

UCSD plays at 2 p.m. on Friday 
against Claremont and then at 4 
p.m. on the same day against La 
Verne. The championship game is 
slated for Saturday at 4 p.m.

Playing the Garnes 
Decides Winners 

This weekend brought up one 
of the most-spoken cliches in 
sports: "That's why you play the 
game: 

The first instance came in the 
Master's Golf Tournament and the 
second took place in the Davis 
Cup tennis matchup this past 
weekend 

Heading into the Master's com-
petition, the great Tiger Woods was 
the overwhelming favorite. He has 
had a stellar year and a stellar 
career, plus he has won the 
Master's in the past. 

Woods is hands down the best 
golfer playing today. He has a 
good chance of winning every 
match he enters. However, this 
does not mean he will be success-
ful. 

Before Master's play even 
started, the media were practical-
ly sizing him up for the green 
jacket. Slow down. ot so fast. 

There were other golfers in the 
tournament, and four of them 
proved to be better than Woods 
this weekend as he finished fifth . 
The winner of the tournament 
was Vijay Singh, who finished at 
10 under par, six strokes ahead of 
Woods. Woods is the best golfer 
today, but he is not the best 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 

That tS why they play the 
game. 

The second example, which 
came at the Davis Cup competi-
tion, was a near disaster. The U.S. 
team was the heavy favorite to 
take the tournament. With the top 
two singles players, Andre Agassi 
and Pete Sampras and the best 
doubles team on the planet, Alex 
O'Brien and jared Palmer, there is 
no reason it should not have 
been . 

The Czech Republic had other 
ideas on its mind, however. 

Agassi did his job winning both 
matches he competed in, but over-
whelming favorite Sampras lost his 
first match and the doubles team 
found itself on the losing end. 
Things looked perilous. 

In Sampras' final match, he sus-
tained an injury. He played through 
it and eventually pulled out the 
win, sending the United States to 
the semi-final round, but not 
before giving heart attacks to many 
U.S. tqlOis fans. The United States 
was favored to breeze through the 
competition, but was almost sent 
packing. 

I look for the United States to 
take the Davis Cup title. Heck, I 
look for the U.S. to take most com-
petitions. Be it World Cup to the 
Olympics to world tennis and golf 
competitions, I think the US will 
win. This is partly out of the fact 
that we have many of the best ath-
letes in the world and partly 
because I root for the home team. 
It is a pride thing. Despite all of 
this, there is one thing that rings 
true: they have to earn it first. 

Again, this is why they play the 
game 

Assumptions have made fools 
out of many people in the sports 
world. There are favorites in every 
competition, but practically hold-
ing the awards ceremony even 
before play begins is a sin. If you 
assume and wind .uP wrong, you 
make an ass out of you and me, and 
that is why they play the game.

PORTS 
Tritons Upset Aztecs 3-2 
Down two games to none, UCSD battles back to beat the SDS U in final home game of the year 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

Things were looking bleak for the Tritons 
in front of a season-high crowd of 651 late 
Tuesday night. San Diego State University was 
up two games to none and leading 16-15 in 
the third, serving for the match. UCSD was 
down but not out as the Tritons overcame two 
match points in the third game to take the win, 
later winning games four and five to win the 
match. 

In the first game, the Thtons got off to a slow 
start and were down 10-3 before the crowd had 
gotten into their seats. After a mini run by the 
Tritons to bring the game to 10-6, SDSU shut 
the door and won 15-6. 

"One of the things we need to work on is 
starting fas t," Head Coach Ron Larsen said. 
"That means we need a good warm-up and we 
need to be focused. If we can get on the teams 
back East early, we can demoralize them." 

In game two the Tritons again got off to a 
slow start, losing the first three points. The 
Tritons fought back and tied the game at nine 
after a kill by Ben Vernon. UCSD was unable to 
keep the momentum, eventually losing the 
game 10-14. 

Game three was as tight as could be as the 
point differential was never more then two 
points. When the going got tough, the Tritons 
looked to Donald Chen. 

"We wanted to win it or lose it with our go-
to guy, and Donald has been our go-to guy all 
season," Larsen said. "The way he handled the 
pressure gave him some confidence and gave 
our team more confidence in him." 

Chen blew up for a season-high 38 kills and 
carried the Tritons on his back to a 17-15 win 
in the third game. 

In game four, the Tritons got on the Aztecs 
early and went up 5-0. 

SDSU won the next six points to get within 
two. Matthew Holve then stuff-blocked the 
SDSU attack to win the game 15-12 and send 
the match to a deciding fifth game. 

The Tritons fell behind by two at 4-6. With 
rally scoring in effect, the Tritons' hopes 
seemed to be dwindling. After a Chen kill made 
it 6-7, Raffi Mitillian had three big serves, 
including two aces, to give the Tritons a 10-8 
lead . From there the Tritons played solid 
offense and won one point at a time. 

Usa Hltf/ GuardIan 
ItNIcII: Triton Donald Chen, who tallied 38 lUlls, and teammate Matthew Halve leap up tJJ block a hit 
from an Aztec opponent during UCSD's 3-2 victory over SDSU on Tuesday. 

Chen's 8th kill of the night gave UCSD a 
15-12 victory in game five and its first win 
against a Division I school this season. 

"I think that this was a really important 
match," Larsen said. · We found out that we 
were mentally tough . That was something that 

will help us in New jersey." 
From here the Thtons head to New jersey for 

the Division III Invitational Championship. The 
first round is on Friday night and the champi-
onship game will be held Saturday. Look for cov-
erage of the tournament in Monday's Guardian. 

Rowing Competes in City 
Championship, Crew Classic 

Women's Water Polo 
Takes Tournament 

Men dominate over rival San Diego schools 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and 
women's crew teams had two 
major competitions in San Diego 
the past two weekends, and both 
teams performed well . 

The San Diego City 
Championships at Mission Bay 
this weekend featured UCSD, 
San Diego State University and 
the University of San Diego. 

"At the city championships, we 
won all three events we entered," 
men's crew Head Coach Michael 
Filippone said. "We have a really 

so Ed squad this year: 
The men 's team took the var-

sity eight event in a time of 
6:21.7. It won the men's novice 
eight race in a time of 6:56.3 and 
the men's novice four won with a 
time of 8:28.1. 

As for women, their results 
weren't quite as good as the men 
but still did well. . 

In earlier action, both crew 
teams competed in the San Diego 
Crew Classic on April 1-2, which 
boasts 3,500 athletes.

Tritons flex their muscles in a pool of schools

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's water 
polo squad knew it had its work 
cut out for it as it had to face' off 
with many of the top competitors 
in women's water polo. 

The NCAA Western Water 
Polo Association Tournament, 
however, saw the Thtons in top 
form, clawing their way to a first-
place finish in a challenging field. 
The tournament consisted. of 
teams from University ' of 
Redlands, Cal St. San Bernadino, 
Loyola Maramount, Whittier 

College, UC Davis, O ccidental 
College, Cal St. Bakersfield, UC 
Santa Cruz, Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps and Pomona Pitzer. 

None of these teams could 
match the tenacity of the UCSD 
team, which went undefeated en 
route to the tournament champi-
onship. Its first showdown came 
against the University of Redlands, 
who were clearly no match for the 
powerful Thton polo squad -
UCSD crushed Redlands to the 
tune of an 11 -3 score.
