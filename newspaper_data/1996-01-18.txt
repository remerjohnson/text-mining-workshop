MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. -
Dr. John Najarian, known for 
his work on the drug ALG -
used to prevent organ rejection 
in transplant patients - could 
face fines of close to $4 
million and a 96-year prison 
sentence if found guilty on 21 
counts of defrauding the 
government, embezzling from 
the University of Minnesota 
and evading taxes. Najarian, 
who was a UM surgeon and 
researcher, stepped down as 
the university 's head of 
surgery in 1993. According to 
the charges, Najarian violated 
the FDA's policies on drug 
studies by misrepresenting 
production and sales figures of 
ALG and failing to report 
adverse effects of the drug, 
which included patient deaths, 
to the FDA.

SIO Given $4.75 Million; 
New Building Planned 
GRANT: Scripps officials 
say the money will help build 
laboratory/office complex 

By Laura Lamb 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD scientists and graduate students at 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) 
wi II oon have ample space for theirresearch 
projects, after a new, 26,600-square-footlabo-
ratory and office complex is completed. 

SIO will use a recent $4.75 million grant 
from the W. M . Keck Foundation to con-
struct the $8 million complex, known as the 

Oceanic and Atmospheri c Research Facility 
(OAR). It will be located north of Nierenberg 
Hall on the Scripps campus. 

Construction will begin during the fall of 
1996, and is scheduled to be completed by 
the end of 1997. 

"The new facility will.. . lay the ground-
work for an integrated global observation 
system with international dimensions," SIO 
Director Edward Frieman said. 

Research at the new facility will focus on 
global issues, including the environment and 
changing atmospheric conditions, as well as 
the development of new instruments.

UCSA Proposal 
.Would ·Change 
Student. Regent 
Process 
TAcnes: Group may submit one 
name to regents next year in protest 
over lack of control over selection 

By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to improve student representati on on 
the UC Board of Regents, the University of Californi a 
Student Association (UCSA) last week submilled to 
the board a proposal to change the Regel}t Procedures 
for Selecting a Student Regent. 

The proposal would confer to the UCSA Board of 
Directors control over selection procedures and the 
final se lection of the student representati ve. It is sched-
uled to be discussed attooay' s regents' meeting. 

Currently, UCSA directors interview and select 
three finali sts from the nine semifinali sts. The final-
its' names are then sent to a commillee of the full 
Board of Regents, which makes the final dec ision. 

The three finali sts submilled by the UCSA this year 
are UC Berkeley law student Jess Bravin, UCLA law 
student Leo Trujillo-Cox and UCLA undergraduate 

hris Schemers. 
The Special Committee for Selection of the Stu-

dent Regent, consisting of Regents William Bagley, 
Meredith Khachigian, John Davies and Judith Levin, 
current Student Regent Ed Gomez and UCSA Chair 
Kri s Kohler, will meet today to se lect the 1996-97 
student regent. 

If approved, the UCSA's proposal would transfer 
the selection of the students' repre entative from the 
regents to the students - the same way the faculty and 
alumni currently choo e their representatives. 

"We believe it will pass ... because faculty and 
alumni can already choose their own representati ves," 
UCSA Executive Director Kimi Lee said. 

In a lelLer to the IJCSA, A.S. Pres ident Naomi Falk 
said students are capable of choosing a representati ve 
"who will amply and adequately represent them." 

"Most regents are businessmen and do not know 
much about academia," she said. 

Falk added that many past student regent would 
not have been chosen if students had made the final 
decision. 

"The regents tend to choose people who are not la w 
students, very conservative, not well-spoken and not 
well -known - people who are the least hassle," she 
said.

Atkinson Starts First Post-Affirmative-Action Outreach Plan 
MINORmES: ueop 
bolsters programs with 
additional $2 million 
By Suketu v ....... v 
Staff Writer 

In accordance with his pledge 
last summer to increase student 
diversity in the UC system, UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson 
unveiled the President ' s Plan to 
Raise Educational Participation 
(PREP) last Thursday - a pro-
gram which will explore alterna-
tives to race-based admissions eri-

telia as a means of achieving di-
versity in the UC system. 

To accomplish the goals set out 
in the plan, Atkinson established an 
outreach task force. The task force 
will try to augment current programs 
designed to expand awareness of 
the VC's educational opportunities 
to all Californians. 

"PREP is designed to provide all 
of California's students with the 
tools they need to realize full educa-
tional potential and to succeed in 
post-secondary education," 
Atkinson said.

A.S. Allocates $1,584 For Election 
COUNCIL: Falk 
threatens veto of 
yesterday's vote 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

The A.S_ Council voted last night 
to approve 51.584 in funding for a 
special election to vote on a new 
A.S. constitution. 

However, A.S. President Naomi 
Falk said various council members' 
discontent may result in her veto of 
the Feb. 6 election. 

"The funding of a special elec-
tion is simply a misuse of student 
money," Falk said. '1 really don't 
think we can justify the expense for 
this special election without going 
on the spring ballot - especially 
considering that there is only 
510,000 left in the A.S. [General 
Unallocated] Budget." 

The money for the special elec-
tion will be allocated from the A.S. 
Soft Reserves Unallocated Budget, 
which Falk said is an unprecedented 
source for funding elections.

"We've never ever before funded 
elections out of any other fund be-
yond the student activity fee," she 
said. 

The rewritten constitution - co-
authored by A.S, Vice-President 
Administrative Jennifer Nicoll. 
Vice-President Finance Edmondo 
Robinson and Student Advocate 
Souley Diallo- shifts the structure 
of the A.S. Council to a "checks and 
balances" system with legislative, 
judicial and executive branches. 

Marshall Junior Senator Cory 
Ewing supported the new 
constitution's adjustments to the 
council's structure. 

"Setting up a system of checks 
and balances will allow [the) coun-
cil to work more effecti vely," Ewing 
said. "Furthermore. it's a system 
specifically designed for a college 
environment. " 

Nicoll cited two advantages of 
Spring Quarter constitutional elec-
tions. 

'There have been some fairly 
harsh accusations from various 
council members toward a special 

election," she said. "However ... if 
we present the constitution concur-
rently with regular elections, a newly 
voted constitution will be silting 
around for a year." 

Nicoll added that a special elec-
tion will give voters time to accus-
tom themselves to the new constitu-
tion. "By presenting the constitu-
tion separately ... there is insurance 
thai the voters will take the time to 
read it and familiarize themselves 
with the issues," she said. 

However, A.S. Commissioner of 
Programming Kevin Moo said the 
funding of a special election may 
renect "a huge conflict of interest." 

'The election ofthis constitution 
is something that can wait until 
Spring Quarter elections," Moo said. 
"It's money we simply don't have to 
spend right now." 

Moo also questioned the content 
of the newly written constitution, 
arguing that it "strips students of the 
power to select their representa-
tives." 

Under the new constitution, com-

CynIcs of Atkinson's ..... 
Need to Put PoIIIIes AsIde 

When the regenlS abolished affirmative action over the 
summer, critics cried out it was a giant step backward for the 
UC system. "This will negatively impact the student population 
and the quality of education at the University of California:' 
A.S. President Naomi Falk said. 

Falk and others seemed willing then to take a serious stand 
for the sake of diversity at the university level. Hers and other 
activislS' efforts culminated in the ill-fated "Freedom City" 
demonstration and the UC Irvine hunger strike. 

But while at one time it appeared the activists were truly 
looking out for minority interests, a recent proposal brought 
forth by UC President Richard Atkinson has proven that their 
true interests lie elsewhere - in bringing attention to themselves 
and playing politics. 

Atkinson has allocated 52 million as part of his President's 
Plan to Raise Educational Participation, in addition to the $18 
million the UC Office of the President will already spend this 
year on outreach programs. Atkinson's earmarked money will 
go toward, among other things, funding lower-income primary 
and secondary schools. In his words, it is "a first step." 

We applaud his efforts. Affirmative action is, and always has 
been, a bJnd-aid solution. By attacking the bigger probkm -
that is, the lack of quality schools in low-income areas -
Atkinson is helping minorities achieve equality in education 
without blatant race-preferences. 

Cynical activists who complain that Atkinson's plan is not as 
far-reaching as affirmative action should stop complaining and 
start looking out for the people they purport to help. 

Vice-President Administrative Jennifer Nicoll, Vice-
President of Finance Edmondo Robinson and'Commissioner of 
Student Affairs Sou ley Diallo have drawn upa new constitution. 
Yet, in~ead of waiting for the regular spring elections, they 
insistoncalling a constitutional convention to bring this proposal 
to the student body. This action is politically irresponsible. 

TIle proposed budget for the convention - $1.500 -
accounts forone-eighth of this year's A.S. General Unallocated 
Funding. This fund's most important function is to buffer 
A.S. 's savings accounlS from unforeseeable expenses requiring 
immediate attention. By spending this $1,500. the A.S. would 
not only weaken an already insufficient fund, but waste money 
to bring about an event which can wait until the regular spring 
elections.

IOyears.onlyone-theRlMACinitiative-drewasignificant 
number of voters. The last special election, aI.iO a constitutional 
convention, drew 900 voters - just 6 percent of the student 
body. In contrast, over 3,000 students voted in last spring's 
election. Considering this document would suddenly change 
the political process at UCSD. the election process must be 
delayed until spring. 

But Nicoll is determined to enact her new project as soon as 
possible. stating, "If we elect a new constitution during spring, 
it will just sit around for a year." 

However, delaying the implementation of a new constitution 
would be beneficial, allowing time for an in-depth examination 
of the document: For example, one of the proposed chanp

nepotism among A.S. insiders with such power.

AMERICA NEEDS TO LEARN 
ABOUT THE REAL KING, JR. 

COMMENTARY: A close look at Martin Luther King, Jr. 's writings 
shows that he supported race-based policies such as affrrmative action 
By Kilthleen Lytle 
Staff Writ~, 

The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
occurred on April 4, 1968, but it is relived every day 
when academics and politicians twist his words to sup-
port a retreat from civil rights. King strongly supported 
the institution of race-specific policies to redress ra-
cial injustice and vehemently warned against token-
ism as a substitute for racial equality. Today, we are 
experiencing a political backlash against civil rights. 
Many people have come to accept tokenism as a sub-
stitute for equality. Ironically. it is a misinterpretation 
of King's dream which fuels this cur-
rent movement in American society. 

The greatest misconception about 
King is thlt he merely struggled for 
integration on buses Ind It lunch 
counters. Such an understatement of 
his vision can only be made in igno-
rance of his writings. King recognized 
that "the absence of brutality IIId un-

a way blacks could get "their due." Centuries of di-
vestment and violence necessitates centuries of invest-
ment and support. Affirmative-action policies were at 
the core of King's vision for building a just America. 
Yet, academics such as Shelby Steele and politicians 
such as Gov. Pete Wilson twist King's words to bol-
ster a social agenda which contradicts his life and 
struggle. 

King's popular phrase, "content of our character" 
IS often decontextualized and utilized to support at-
tacks on affirmative action. It is argued that race should 
not explicitly be a factor in employment, promotions 

. regenerate evil is noIthe po:sence of 
justice." Justice was his vision, and 
justice was his demand. Desegregation 
was only the necessary foundation for

or college admissions, and that all 
people should be judged solely by the 
"content of their character." Such 
rhetoric sounds ideal. oot because rac-
ism still has a firm grip on the Ameri-
can psyche and institutions, a race-
blind society remains a goal and is not 
the present state of American society. 
It WIS in the context of the Promised 
Land that King intended the "content 
of our character" quote to be applied. 
It is intel1ectually criminal for academ-
ics and politicians to pervert four of 
King's wOrds to support a retreat from 
civil rights when King's demands for 
race-based policies were clear and un-In his final book, Whe~ Do ~ Go

wavering. 
On the surface, it is ironic to find 

such diversity among the betrayers of 
Kin,'s vision. Black and white lead-
ers alike have joined together in igno-
rance to misconstrue King's dream. 
Yet, tokenism and Uncle Toms are 
nothing new. Increased tokenism was 
not King's dream, but rather his recur-
ring nightman::. He warned America, 
specifically black America, of the pos-
sible increase in tokenism after the

COMMENTARY: As the Republican Party prepares itself for the election year, it remains to be seen whether its 
Christian branch will help or hinder its presidential aspirations 

CHRISTIAN COALmON LEADS GOP BY THE THROAT 
ByN8tMn ...... 
Contributinc Opinion Writer 

As author PJ. O'Rourke is fond 
of saying, "A litlle government and 
a little luck are necessary in life, but 
only a fool trusts either of them. "If 
recent polls measuring the AlTh:ri-
can electorate's distaste for politi-
cians tell us anything, it's that vot-
ers are taking this adage to bean. 
This shift in public opinion - more 
than anything else - promises to 
make 1996 a very volatile campaign 
season. 

Although the front-runner status 
of presidential candidate Bob Dole 
has not been (and probably never 
will be) seriously challenged, it will 
nevertheless be very interesting to 
see how he traverses the moderate-
conservative faull line within the 
GOP. For if the congressional elec-
tions of 1994 established anything, 
it was the preeminence of Christian 
conservatives in Republican poli-
tics. The Christian right. as embod-
ied by the Christian Coalition. is 
now the most important and most 
controversial constituency in the 
Republican party. 

This novel political reality raises 
some very important questions. Is 
the Christian Coalition good for 
America? Is it even good for Chris· 
tianity? Liberals have and will con-
tinue to go to great lengths to de-
nounce the Christian right and its 
objectives. Unfortunately, their 
analysis often boils down to acari· 
cature of Christian conservatives as 

KING: His 
powerful words are 
misunderstood 
ContInued from pace 4 
charges of racism. 

It is assumed that if some blacks 
can "succeed," then any vestiges of 
inequality are not due to racism. 
Thus, no substantial change in the 
daily lives of the majority of blacks 
needs to occur before we proclaim 
that we have reached the Promised 
Land. But all we have achieved thus 
far is tokenism, not justice. 

Even more detrimental to the 

fire-breathing, fundamentalist big-
ots. But as a recent CompuServe 
commercial reminds us, sometimes 
life calls for deeper answers. 

Last year, the Christian Coalition 
published an agenda for the 100h 
Congress dubbed, "The Contract 
with the American Family."Taking 
its cue from the political success of 
the GOP's "Contract with 
America," the Christian Coalition 
listed 10 items in need of immedi-
ate legisiative aUention : religious 
equality, local control of education, 
school choice, parental rights, fam-
ily tax relief, abortion, reduced lev-
els of federal social spending. por-
nography, crime and the public sub-
sidization of the arts. 

There is nothing new aboutthcse 
issues. Conservatives of all religious 
stripes have been arguing for re-
fonns in these areas for years. What 
;s new is that a certain group of 
Christians has practically taken up 
these positions as articles of faith. 
The way some of these people talk, 
one might think the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education is a modem-day 
version of King Nebuchadnezzar, 
holding our children's education 
captive in Babylon, or that the Bible 
says God is for a balanced-budget 
amendment and a return to the gold 
standard. 

II is nol merely the substance of 
these proposals which startles some 
Americans. Rather, it is the advo-
cacy of these policies under the ae· 
gis of Christianity which gives 

struggle for equality is the endless 
chatter of tokenism's ugly sibling, 
Uncle Tom. King wrote in Chaos or 
Community?, "This kind of Negro 
leader acquires the white man 's con-
tempt for the ordinary Negro. He is 
often more at home with the middle-
class white than he is among his 
own people, and frequently his 
home is moved up and away from 
the gheuo. His language changes, 
his location changes, his income 
changes and ultimately he changes 
from the representative of the Ne· 
gro to the white man. into the white 
man's representative to the Negro."

how to forge some measure of com-

will only take us so far. Common 
ground must be found in areas 
where government involvement is 
necessary. The problem with the 
Christian Coalition lies in its inter-
est-group mentality. It is precisely 
because these conservatives identify 
themselves as Christians first, and 
citizens second, that makes their po-
litical activity counterproductive. 
Few would argue that since the New 
Deal, the interest-group mentality 
has gone a long way toward mak-
ing our political climate more con-
tentious and fractious. 

So to forge common political 
ground, we need to agree on pub-
licly acceptable standards of reason-
ing. We need to find terms of de-
bate which everyone can embrace. 
Obviously. an appeal to Holy Scrip-
ture is not going to get us very far 
in a discussion about, say, abortion 
because not every person accepts 
the Bible's authority. But an appeal 
to principles that all reasonable 
people can accept is just Ihe sort of 
discourse which can bring a polity 
closer together. 

Political common ground based 
on a widely accepted set of prin-
ciples has not been unknown in our 
country. Influenced by the i ntellec-
tual thought of the Age of Enlight-
enment, our republic was estab· 
lished by political leaders who were 
accustomed to debating on terms of 
reason and natural law. They cor-
rectly recognized that because all 
laws express a moral sentiment, it 

has achieved a state of tokenism 
and, at times, Uncle Tom-ism, us-
ing them as a vicious substitute for 
justice. 

Kill g's vi sion for justice and 
equality reached well beyond token-
ism and into economic justicc for 
all Americans. In 1964, he published 
a "Bill of Rights for the Disadvan-
taged" and supported A. Phillip 
Randolph's Freedom Budget, a 
Marshall Plan for America's poor. 
King was not murdered because he 
wanted to integrate schools and 
buses. He wanted instead to restruc-
ture America's social and economic 
hierarchy and, for this, he was and 

is necessary that lawgivers find the 
right moral sentiments to enact and 
enforce. For instaoce. justices of the 
Supreme Court at that time. in light 
of the fact that they had no prece· 
dents to follow. appealed to the prin-
ciples of natural law in justifyin~ 
their opinions. 

How times have changed. With 
the advent of interest-group politics, 
our polity has lost sight of the mode 
of political reasoning with which the 
framers of the Constitution were 
familiar - an intellectual posture 
which self-consciously seeks out the 
common good. In practice, the 
Christian Coalition, just like any 
other contemporary interest group, 
does little in the way of recovering 
this mode of thought. The Christian 
Coalition's policies may be correct 
- they are cenainly popular - but 
it has yet to properly engage itself 
in public debate, where its agenda 
could be justified in terms of a pub-
licly acceptable notion of natural 
law. 

The ascendancy of the Chris· 
tian Right 's political power is in · 
deed a recent phenomenon. It was 
Jerry Falwell's organization , 
Moral Majority, which helped 
bring Ronald Reagan to power in 
1980 - not even 20 years ago -
which marked the arrival of this 
new force. in American politics . 
Moreover. it is at odds with tradi -
tional notions of how Christianity 
should relate to the state. In 196.5, 

See CHRISTIAN, Page 6 

still is assassinated. 
Those who auempt to support a 

withdrawal from civil rights using 
King's own words and who falsely 
protect tokenism as the actualization 
of his dream betray the legacy of an 
American hero. Perhaps it is the 
weak implementation of affirma-
tive-action policies which delivered 
us to the doorstep of tokenism. But 
to invoke the image of King to sup· 
port a retreat from aflirmative ac-
tion is a tragic misinterpretation of 
King 's true nature and the strategy 
of his dream. A bullet may have 
murdered the man, but twisted poli -
tics drown his dream.

COMMENTARY: From jobs to dining, university life holds numerous surprises, especially for impressionable 
freshmen eager to escape their parents and enter the world of independence 

FREsHMEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF UCSD,BLUES 
ContributIng Opinion Writer 

Being a freshman is one of life's 
most interesting and trying experi-
ences. I have grown accustomed to 
my classes, new friends and the al-
ways-eventful dorm life. However, 
there arc a few things which I still 
don 'l understand about university 
life. [thought college was supposed 
to be one new and exci ting experi-
ence after another. I also thought it 
would be liberating, with no Mom 
or Dad there to tell you to tum the 
radio down. Unfortunately, this wa~ 
all foolish thinking on my pan. 

During the first week of school, 
I decided to expand my hori7..ons by 
looking for an interesting job. 
(Cleaning mold off books did not 
fall into that category.) But every 
job I fOund stimulating or educa-
tional had a downside. Because I'm 
still not sure about my major, I 
thought I could gain valuable expe-
rience by working in various fields, 
with the hope that one day I could 
say, "Hey, I want to be a marine bi-

oJogist." Unfortunately, Scripps In-
stitution of Oceanography didn' t ex-
actly see things my way. What alien-
ated me most was that these jobs all 
favored students with computer ex-
perience. 

I wanted the job to get computer 
experience - beyond typing. If I al-
ready had the computer skills nec-
essary to gel a job, then I wouldn'l 
need to go to college in the first 
place. Though the Catch-22 of find-
ing ajob was discouraging, il wasn'l 
as depressing as the dining choices 
on campus. 

Everybody scared me into be-
lieving I would actually gain 15 
poUnds as a freshman, but that is a 
complete joke. The food at certain 
eateries was just what I needed to 
stop eati ng altogether. for example, 
Muir's Rathskellar will tum your 
stomach. I can smell and taste the 
oil the second I walk into the place, 
and once I get my food, I have to 
mop up the excess fat with a nap-
kin . 
. Another freshman fallacy is the 

Christ, and begin doing anything 
else - including fighting commu-
nism, or participating in civil-
rights reforms .... Preachers are 
not called to be politicians but to 
be soul winners .... Nowhere are 
we commissioned to reform the 
externals . The gospel does not 
clean up the outside but rather re-
generates the inside."

This ideal of separation of 
church and state dales back much 
earlier than the founding of this 
country, at least back to the Prot-
estant Reformation. As even Jesus 
said in the first century, "Render 
unto Caesar what is Caesar's . 
Render unto God what is God's." 
PUlling things in this perspective 
casts the polilicalzeal of conser-

not press my parents for a car. That 
was a bad move. Yes, UCSD is a 
lovely campus, and I can spend 
hours staring at the "UFO" library 
and the naked tree in front of it. But 
not on the weekends. It 's under-
standable that when there aren't 
many people on campus (i.e. on the 
weekends), little I ~ actually going 
on. Sadly, there is only so much 
studying and surfing one can do. 

After three months of school, [ 
seem to have adjusted to suite life. 
However, the bathrooms are another 
maller. I can understand a hot-wa-
ter shortage in some third-world na-
tion, but what is wrong with the 
plumbing at UCSD? Recently, my 
suitemate was taking a shower and 
water began coming out of the drain 
in the middle of the bathroom. For 
a moment, I thought we would have 
to call the flood relief crew. 

It would be lovely to have a pool 
in the suite, but having a free-flow-
ing mudbath in the bathroom is less 
appealing. The school apparently 
turned off the hot water for the holi-

valive Christians in a particularly 
unfavorable light. . 

Christianity is not merely a sys-
tem of ethics. By the same token, 
Christianity does not embrace any 
particular political theory or ide-
ology. Devout Christians through-
out the ages have often disagreed 
about political matters. Militant 
organizations like the Christian

days. 
Another aspect of college which 

makes me feel as though I never left 
is "quiet hours." In the beginning 
of the school year, I would tum my 
radio up and a campus security of-
ficer would arri ve shonly. Yet , there 
are people who stand in front of my 
room screaming and yelling like 
lunatic:. and nobody tells them to 
shut up. My radiO bothers no one 
except my roommate - whom I 
reserve the righl to bug once in a 
while - but the "screamers" are 
just plain annoying. And what is the 
point of "quiel hours" on the week-
end? The week is over and students 
need to vent their frustrations -
something much more enjoyable 
when others are sleeping. 

Yes, freshmen have to face 
many trials in college. However, 
my life here so far has gone pretty 
smoothly, and I have no long-last-
ing regrets . These general com-
plaints will probably never 
change . Otherwise, it wouldn' t be 
as fun to be a freshman . 

Coalition debase politics by cre-
ating yet another interest group, 
and they equally debase Christian-
ity by embracing a vision of poli-
tics as an article of faith. Perhaps 
America can sustain yel another 
interest group, but it is far from 
clear whether Christianity can re-
tain its integrity while trafficking 
in righl- or left-wing politics. 

Thursday, January 18, 1996 

Well, I don't know because I 
haven't dated that many guys 
at UCSD, but the guys I know 
[who] are my friends seem 
pretty okay . As far as relation-
ship-wise, I haven't had any 
problems because I haven't 
had any relationships with 
[UCSD] guys.

OUTREACH: 
uc operates over 
1,()()() programs 
COIIIInued from ..... 1 

The new outreach initiative fo-
cuses primarily on increasing the 
number of underrepresented and 
low-income students in the UC sys-
tem, which was previously sus-
tained with the help of such pro-
grams as affinnative action. The 
regents voted last 1uly to abolish 
all affinnative-action programs in 
the UC system by 1997. 

"There has been no timetable 
set for the task force as of yet, but 
(task-force members] will be meet-
ing next month to discuss their plan 
of action," UC Office of the Presi-
dent (UCOP) spokesperson Terry 
Lightfoot said. 

The UCOP announced in De-
cember the findings of the commit-
tee on Undergraduate Admissions 
Criteria, which reviewed admis-
sions policies throughout the UC 

system. The commillee acknowl-
edged that it is possible to increase 
racial diversity in the UC system 
without admission based on either 
race or gender. 

As a result of the committee's 
findings, Atkinson recently allo-
cated $2 million to the outreach 
task force to initiate PREP, a plan 
to broaden the diversity of racial 
and socio-economic backgrounds 
within the UC student population. 

PREP funding wi II augment the 
SI8 million UCOP will spend this 
year on existing outreach programs, 
which serve more than 75,000 stu-
dents in California universities and 
community colleges. 

While more than I ,000 outreach 
programs are currently being ad-
ministered by the nine UC cam-
puses, one of the task force's pre-
vailing goals is to design new out-
reach methods using PREP's re-
cently acquired funds. 

Student Regent Ed Gomez 
warned that current outreach fund-
ing cannot insure the level of di-

The UCSD Guardian 

versity sought by the regents,add-
ing that the university's existing 
outreach initiatives are not viable 
alternatives to affirmative action. 

"Any time the university is 
spending money on outreach, it is 
a good idea," Gomez 'laid, "but S2 
million is not even close to the 
minimum of $140 million which 
would be needed if they want to 
reach those who need it." 

The outreach task force is co-
chaired by C. Judson King, the 
UC's interim provost and senior 
vice president for academic affairs, 
and Richard A. Clarke, retired 
chairman and chief executive of-
ficer of Pacific Gas and Electric. 
The task force consists of UC edu-
cators, educators from other seg-
ments of higher and K-12 educa-
tion, as well as representati ves from 
pri vate industry. 

Regent Clair W. Burgener de-
scribed the task force's objective 
as "enlarging and strengtheni ng the 
state's intellectual resources across 
cultural and economic boundaries."

the UCSA carried through on its 
threat next year, the regents might

DnDER6RDUDD I I II 
mARY WORONOV RECEN1LY TOOK 11ME out from her work on "Women," a series for Showtime which she is 
filming in Los Angeles, to talk about her 
memories of Andy Warhol and the Velvet

the Underground, Woronov recalls the 
period she spent as part of Warhol's group 
of artistic friends in the late '60s. She 
danced and toured with Nico and the 
Velvet Underground, following them to 
Los Angeles, where she now lives. Having 
appeared in films such as Rock 'N'RolI

On Andy W.tlol 

'1'm sorry I didn't get to know him 
better. But [don't think any of us could 
know him really well. I did have feelings 
about him. I had an odd want to protect 

him. I am happy I was around him because 
I believe he was the cause for this chaotic, 
primal matter, and out of it you can face 
your demons. I believe he is a great artist 
because he has changed things, especially 
in his film work, which I think is his most 
important work. [t was bad sound. It was 
location shooting. Il was gender switching. 
If everybody thought this is what we do, 
Andy would try something else. That's a 
true arti st."

figure, as were many of the people who 
hung around Wamol. He created an

They either hated you and ignored you, or 
they liked you as a human being." 
OnDnip , 

"My feelings about drugs are really not 
politically correct. My feelings are very 
individualistic, and I do not mean to preach 
to anybody else. For myself, I have come 
to think that there is a religious way you 
can use drugs to change your mind, to tum

Pauly Shore Makes an 
Unwelcomed Return 

Comedian teams up with 
Stephen Baldwin in Bio-Dome 

ByD.nleIOk .. 
StsffWriter 

Pauly Shore is back and as an-
noying as ever. Except 
this time, he' s not alone. 
Stephen Baldwin, a real-
life friend of Shore, shares 
top billing in lason 
Bloom's directorial de-
but. Bio-Dome. 

The premise of the 
film was originally con-
ceived by scriptwriters 
Kip Koenig and Scott Marcano 
about 20 years ago, long before the 
actual Biosphere in Arizona was 
constructed. Considering that the 
concept sat on the shelves for a 
good two decades, some may end 
up asking ifit should have sat there 
for another 20 years. While B;o-
Dome has its moments, the story line 
is seldom more than mildly amus-
ing, and it is often extremely far-
fetched. 

The film relies heavily on the 
odd chemistry between Baldwin and 
Shore, who make a convincing pai r 
of junior-college slacker idiots -
think Bi II and Ted, only a lot 
dumber. The part of Bud, the duo's 

leader, requires little of Shore's "act-
ing" ability (essentially to annoy), 
as he basically recycles the manner-

isms which made him fa -
mous on MTV . Doyle 
(Baldwin), on the other 
hand, is best described as 
gullible and dim-willed, 
which explains why he 
seems to be the only one 
who looks up to Bud. The 
part, while simple, did pro-
vide Baldwin with several 

opportunities for some impromptu 
acts with Shore, many of which 
worked with a surprising degree of 
success. 

The whole fi asco i set into mo-
tion when Bud and Doyle arc out-
witted by their - surprise! - ex-
treme ly des irable gi rlfriends, 
Monique (Joey Adams) and Jen 
(Teresa Hill ), who, in stark contrast 
to their boyfri ends, share a genuine 
concem for the envi ronment. As a 
result , Bud and Doyle drive into the 
Arizona desert and accidentally end 
up locked in the Bio-Dome experi -
mental facility during it s inaugura-
tion, thinking the place is an ultra-
modern mini-mall . 

The UCSD 0uardiIn ThIIrsday, JIIUU)' 18, 1996 

_ Courtesy of Gene Page 
W .... I.: Bud (Pauly Shore) and Doyle (Stephen Baldwin) play two slackers who scope out the babes 
before they get trapped in a futuristic environment in Bio-Dome. 

Unfortunately, the Dome is to 
remain sealed for an entire year, 
leaving Bud and Doyle trapped in-
side with five Bio-Dome scientists. 
Two of the scientists, played by 
Kylie Minog ue and Dara 
Tomanovich, just happen to be gor-
geous enough - surprise again! -
to make Bud and Doyle think twice 

about wanting out. 
Much to the dismay of the scien-

ti sts, Bud and Doyle go about their 
merry way destroying years of care-
ful planning, and the entire project 
in the process. While Bio-Dome has 
its shortcomings, it sti II manages to 
deliver some decent low-brow hu-
mor. But those searching for agenu-

incly entertaining experience might 
be better off checking out the film ' 
excellent soundtrack, which in-
cludes everything from "Psychobi lI y 
Freakout" by the Reverend Honon 
Heatlo the Ramones' rendition of 
the Spiderman theme song. 

Bio-Dome is playing at theaters 
throughout San Diego.

Tanner Show at Che Cafe 
Recalls Venue's Early Days 

Four indie bands played distinct sets 
By F ....... SluldH 
Special to the Guardian 

Que viva La mJLSica revolucion! 
Since its inception, 

UCSD'sCIle Cafe has fos-
tered a virtual musical revo-
lution; and with perfor-
mances byTanncr and Soul 

. lunk on Friday night. it 
appears to be back on the 
culling edge. 

During the first few 
years of this decade, the 

• Che was home to a vital undercurrent 
of rock. Out-of-loWn bands as signifi-
cant as The Nation of Ulysses and 
Green Day regularly stopped through, 
and homegrown acts like Rocket From 
the Crypt, Truman's Water, Fishwife, 
Crash Worship and Drive Like Jehu 
repeatedly perfonned there, certify-
ing the Che as San Diego's most Ie-
gitimate indie-performance venue. 

A patron of the CM in the early 
'90s could have caught the now-infa-
rnous-but-iJcfunct Fishwife, Rocket 
From The Crypt without its hom sec-
tion, or even Truman's Water before 

Christianity had its way with them. 
The Che became (and to a lesser ex-
tent still is) a substantial show-venue 

competitor in San Diego. It 
competes (however unin-
tentionally) with the likes 
of The Casbah and SOMA 
as an acceptable, accessible 
indie-rock institution. For 
good or for ill, the CM is 
still riding on much of the 
momentum of those days 
(Pearl lam singer Eddie 

Vedder still takes time to surrepti-
tiously frequent the place). 

Last Friday's concert (sponsored 
by KSDT), was the closest the CM 
has come to one of its heyday shows 
in a long whi Ie. With its vegan kitchen 
operating at full steam, four bands of 
great stature perfonned with an ardor 
and novelty reminiscentofthose good 
01' days. 

Maybe it was because Tanner, 
three-fourths of Fishwife, had not 
played there since the band was 
Fishwife. Its illustrious perfonnance 
brought the house down. A galva-

nized standing-room-only set pro-
vided a broad cross-section of rau-
cous new material, while the sound 
quality benefited from the eM' ,s 
unique acoustics. As its set came to an 
ostensible end, the crowd insi sted they 
continue - adamantly enough that 
Tanner finished on an uncharacteris-
tic I 4th song, leavingthevery interac-
tive audience reeling from its dense, 
ri If-ridden brand of pretenseless rock. 

The popular Soul Junk. featuring a 
member of Truman's Water. played 
to an audience of only 20, due to a 
delayed start ti me. Still, the band man-
aged to put on an exquisite perfor-
mance of its drifting, indulgent rock-
jazz fusion. 

The one out-of-town act. the L.A.-
based Jackass, wowed an audience of 
foreigners with a two-part set of sac-
charine-sweet rock, enough for any 
fan of Pavement or Sebadoh persua-
sion. And San Diego newcomers the 
Young Destroyers served up the open-
ing set of monolithic, vocal-driven 
pieces, evoking gothic music and self-
mutilation.

Robbins put a 10l of tho!lght into

and, most impoltllllly, bcr 
devotion to day-to-day 
work. 

Robbins writes in the 
liner notes, "She walks on 
the canh, not in some inac-
cessible ethereal place. The 
music had to reflect that; it 
had to be grounded in life 

and its experiences." 
The album is full of won-

THE CYNIC 
SEAN RAHIMI 

It's Time for 
'Wayne's World' 

Put down your organic fruit 
bar and listen up. I'm going to 
discuss some tough-nosed, in-
your-face, glass-shattering, all-
out-fighting hockey. So put 
down your Gatorade and 
Power Bar and pay attention. 

The Los Angeles Kings are 
now faced with the decision of 
whether to trade the greatest 
player in the history of hockey 
- namely Wayne Gretzky. 
This situation has arisen 
because of Wayne's under-
standable concern about his 
future in Los Angeles. 

In ~is view, he is a gifted 
player whose talents are being 
wasted on a mediocre team. 
Wayne wants to win another 
Stanley Cup, and he wonders if 
he could still do it in Los 
Angeles, or if he should hit the 
ice someplace else. 

This ultimatum leaves the 
Kings with two choices. 
Number one, trade Wayne to 
New York or Detroit - where 
he has a chance to win a 
Stanley C,up with buddies 
Mark Messier or Paul Coffey 
- in return for young players 
to build for the future. 

L.A.'s second option is to 
keep 'The Great One" and 
spend money to make the 
Kings c(\ntenders again, 
signing some lalented free-
agents while Gretzky is still 
young. You see, Wayne turns 
35 next week, and he isn't 
getting any younger. 

But, I'm going to make it 
really easy for the Kings. 

Plan B! 
What the '%@$!*II%, are 

these PliPple thinking? Wayne 
Gretzky is the greatest hockey 
player ever, period. He is to 
hockey what Pelt is to soccer, 
Miguel.lndurain is to cycling 
and Michael Jackson is to 
plastic surgery. In fact, 
Gretzkfs arrival in L.A. 
caused an explosion of interest 
in hockey all over So. Cal. 

Rising popularity and fan 
awareness of hockey eventually 
brought two expansion teams to 
California - the Mighty Ducks 
and the Sharks. 

Gretzky elevated his team's 
play, taking the Kings to the 
Stanley Cup Finals in 1992. But, 
since then, the Kings have 
missed the playoffs two out of 
three years. In hockey, 16 out of 
26 teaJru make the playoffs. 
Translation: your team has to be 
pretty bad to miss out. 

Los Angeles must take 
advanlage of Wayne's lalent. 
He is at the age where he can't

Tritons Shoot 
Down Hawks 
STOMPING: The Christian Heritage Hawks are 
chicken feed for the UCSD machine in 78-39 win 
By Robin Kezlrian 
Staff Writer 

The current trend in UCSD 
women's basketball is to display 
knock-down defense, showcase re-

liable scorers and 
post big wins. The 
Tritons' 78-39 de-
feat of Christian 
Heritage College on 
Tuesday night was 
no exception to the 
trend. 

"We played more 
aggressively against Whittier [Sat-
urday night] and Christian Heri -
tage than we have played in a long 

, while," Triton Head Coach Judy 
Malone said. 

UCSD centers Tianna Meriage 
and Summer Begley kept their op-
position out of the paint, limiting 
the Hawks to a mere 15 points in 
the first half. Meriage, making her

Splash DQWD at UCLA 
INVITE: UCSD performed well in a meet with Division I and II 
schools last weekend at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

On most occasions, the UCSD swimming and 
diving teams compete side-by-side. However, 
last weekend, the Triton diving squad ventured 
out on its own in search of tougher compe-
tition. And the team found it at the UCLA 
Invitational Diving Tournament, which 
was held at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Cen-
ter. The UCSD squad was honored by 
being the only Division m school ex-
tended an invitation. but the Tritons were 
not satisfied simply to show up. 

Day two of the invitational included compe-
tition on the men's one-meter board and the 
women's three-meter. 

Triton senior Sheri Takeuchi - the defend-
ing Division ill NCAA champion on the three-

meter board - rebounded from a rough 
showing on the one-meter to notch a score 
of378.4. That tally earned her a 12th place 
finish among 40 divers. 

Burgasser did not disappoint on day 
two, as he dove to a score of 398.76 and a 
fifth-place finish among the 30 competi-
tors. . 

Also diving for UCSD were freshmen 
Jessica Burtenshaw and Jordanna Perlman. Ac-
cording to diving Head Coach Josh Curtiss. 
"both [freshmen] had a good showing for their 
first collegiate tournament." 

fin. 
"Meriage played awesome de-

fense against Griffin," Malone 
said. "She was boxing her out -
boxing her out of bounds." 

Meriage also tallied six points 
and three rebounds. 

Coming off an impressive per-
formance against Whittier, Begley 
contributed nine points and four 
rebounds. 

Triton veteran guards Cindy 
Yamasaki and Marcia Jeffries led 
UCSD's offensive drive . 
Yamasaki , continuing to post stel-
lar numbers this season, finished 
with 17 points - including a stel-
lar three of six from three-point 
land. 

Jeffries surged back into action 
with 16 points, after being slowed 
by the nu for the last couple of 
weeks. 

See PLUCKED, Page 15 

HInII N!luyen/ GuBn1i8ll 

The competition opened on Saturday 
afternoon with the men's three-meter and the 
women's one-meter springboard events. Senior 
Adam Burgasser highlighted the day's competi-
tion for UCSD. Burgasser, competing against a 
field of Division I and II divers, half-piked to a 
score of 424.55. That tally was good enough for 
a fourth-place finish among a talented field of25-
plus divers. 

Not in attendance for the Tritons was return-
ing All-American diver Kristi Young, who was 
forced to remain in La Jolla due to illness.
