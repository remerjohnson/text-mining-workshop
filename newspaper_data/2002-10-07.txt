Crowded walkways and shorter passing periods

Collective 
claims links are 

intended to 
educate users 

By LAURA McCiANN 
Associate News Editor 

After being accused of supply-
ing a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion with material support, the 
Che Cafe collective's stance is that 
its actions have not been in sup-
port of terrorism, but in support 
of the pursuit of education.

Passing period: Students march up the hill to Peterson Hall from Library Walk. 
Passing periods are now marked by more students and less time to walk to class. 

On Sept. 16, the collective 
received a letter from Gary 
Ratcliff, director of the University 
Centers, informing the group that 
it was in violation of university 
policy and federal law for posting 
a link to the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia on the 
Imrn.u(sd.tdu Web si te, which is 
maintained by the Che collective. 
The FARC is on the U.S. State 
Department's list of foreign ter-
rorist organizations.

A s decided by the Academic Senate last Januarr, the shortening of the passing 
period between classes from 15 to 
10 minutes went into effect at the 
beginning of this year. The aim of 
the shortened passing period is to 
allow for an extra class period dur-
ing the school day, which, due to a 
rapidly increasing undergraduate 
student body, is needed to accom-
modate all students. 

New health survey to be

By RAY HENCiST

Major changes to the recre-

will be made, pending the analysis 
of the 1,256-student Healthy 
Physically Active Lifestyles survey. 
HPAL, which tackles issues such as 
nutrition, physical exercise and 

emotional health, is part of an 
effort by the Office of Student 
Affairs to improve student health 
at UCSD. 

The survey, which was conduct-

New arts center opens at 
UC Davis on October 3 
The Robert and Margrit Mandavi Center 

for the Perfomning Arts at UC Davis opened 
on Oct. 3 with an inaugural concert by the 
San Francisco Symphony. 

The $57 million performing arts center 
features a sta te-of-the-art 1,BOO-seat per-
formance hall and a 250-seat studio the-
ater. The building also features academic 
space for use by the department of music 
and department of theatre and dance. 

The openin~ featu ~ed speeches by 
numerous IndiViduals, Including Lt. Gov. 
Cruz Bustamante, as well as a blessing by 
members of the Patwin tribe. The site of the 
building was once a burial ground for the 
Patwins. 

Funding to build the center was raised 
through a combination of university contri-
butions and private donations. The largest 
donation came from Napa Valley wine 
maker Robert Mondavi and his wife, who 
gave $10 million. The Mondavis also donat-
ed $25 million to UC Davis for a future wine 
and food science institute. 

Doctors at UCLA upgrade 
conjoined twins' status 
The conditions pf the conjoined 

Guatemalan twins separated at UCLA's 
Mattei Children's Hospital in August have 
been upgraded. 

Maria de Jesus Quiej Alvarez has been 
upgraded to good condition and was 
moved from the pediatric intensive care 
unit into a regular patient room on Sept. 26. 

H.er sist~r~ Maria Teresa! was upgraded 
to fair condition and remains in the pedi-
atric intensive care unit She has undergone 
several follow-up operations since the initial 
procedure, and her recovery has lagged 
behind her sister's. 

The 14-month-old girls, bam conjoined 
at the head, were separated during a 23-
hour surgery on Aug. 6. Doctors anticipate 
that the twins will be well enough to return 
to Guatemala sometime in October.

Passing: Shorter period results in 
less time for gossip between classes 

contirwed from fNltt , 
es has increased the lack of socializing at 
UCSD_ 

"Now, because of the lO-minute passing 
period, I am forced to stare at the rround in 
fear that I will recognize anyone that will 
result in a conversation, making me late for 
class," McEnery said. "People are even more 
unsocial." 

Warren senior Alex Marjanovic agrees 
thar the ten minute passing period is too 
short. 

"It's basically like you're getting a workout 
on your way to class, and I don't dUnk it 
should be that way," Marjanovic said, 

Other srodents suggested that the short-
ened periods between classes would not be 
so detrimental to their punctuality if it 
weren't for the fact that that the campus is 
over-crowded. Ironically, the overflowing 
student body was also the instigator of the 
five-minute deduction .

MONDAY, Ot."TOBER 7, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEW } 

Burn: Web site post summarizes collective's stance / Computer Repair concinued from page I Aguilar, director of student policy 
and judicial affairs, sa id that the 
collective would be receiving a 
clarification lener explaining that 
the posting of the link to the FARC 
was not why it was in violation of 
university policy and federal law. 
The violation, Aguilar said, was 
due to the collective allegedly 
"hosting" the FARC Web site. 

Although the collective has not 
been officially informed of the 
change in allegations, it currently 
maintains that it is simply provid-
ing a link to the FARC site rather 
than actually hosting the site. 

The university considers that a 
Web site is being "hosted" when 
ucsd.tdll is included in the site's 
address. Currently, the Che Cafe 
collective has not been formerly 
charged with misconduct or been 
officially made aware of the change. 

in allegations by the Wliversity. The 
collective's current stance, however, 
is that its actions in maintaining the 
bllrn.w:sd.tdu Web site have been to 
provide a primary media source. 

"We no longer need to look to 
the television or newspapers to learn 
about current events and the people 
participating in them because we 
can just look to these people direct-
ly and decide what we thinJc: on our 
own," states the Burn site. 

The Burn site maintains that it 
does not provide support for the 
orlf'lnization, but merely an oppor-
tunity for the site's audience to 
decide whether or not to support 
the group. 

"We're not giving money to the 
FARC (or anyone else)," the Burn 
site says. "We're not training them 
or housing them or giving them 
weapons. The extent of our 'sup-
port' for the FARC is a hyperlink ... 

We simply provide a link to their 
page so that people can make up 
their own minds about them." 

The collective believes that the 
university's investigation of the 
allegations is based on an ulterior 
motive. 

"WIth this COWltry skipping mer-
rily toward filscism, jwnping on the 
'war against terrorism' bandwagon 
seelllS to be a stance UCSD thinks 
will be popular: the Burn site states. 

The Burn site sees the universi-
ty's actions as an anack on academ-
ic freedom. 

"In a world where academic 
freedom is under anack, the uni-
versities should be at the frontlines 
of the struggle to save it, instead of 
rushing to help destroy it," says the 
Burn site.

posed and defeated by eight votes 
during the 2002 winter quarter. 
According to Tom Chapman, ERC 
junior and A.S. Council freshman 
interim senator, this narrow margin 
persuaded the council to try again 
with a slightly altered referendum. 

The bulk of the funding the 
individual colleges receive for stu-
dent activities comes direcdy from 
the A.S. Council. 

"ERC is the first college to run 
out of funds every year," he said. 

As Chapman noted, the lower 
ERC enrollment leads to a deficit in 
funds for Student Council at ERC 
activi ties. 

"Unfortunately, there is gener-
ally a base cost for putting on stu-
dent activities, regardless of the 

actual number of participants," 
Chapman said. 

Most ERC students approached 
about the referendum either did 
not yet know about it or did not 
feel informed enough to make a 
decision. Chapman indicated that 
informational e-mails would be 
sent our before voting commenced. 

Some students feel dubious 
about the legitimacy of the referen-
dum's benefits. 

"r think this [referendum) 
sounds sleazy. They are so vague in 
the way it's worded," said Tristan 
Wand, a fifth-year srodenr at ERe. 

Wand stated that after seeing 
the information available, he did 
nO( plan to vote on the referendum. 

"Five dollars a quarter is really 
not that much," said Thor Aye, a 

freshman at Roosevelt. "Even if they 
don't come through on all these 
promises, they are still offering us a 
lot. [ think [SCERC] could do a bet-
ter job if they had more funding." 

Many upperclassmen tended to 
side with Wand's feelings toward the 
proposed fee increase. Though stu-
dent activities are open to all classes.

OPINION 
smo 

The medical use of marijuana should be 
federally recognized and made legal 

By CLAIRE J. VANNEnE 
Opinion Editor 

In 1996, California voters approved a 
proposition that improved the health care 
possibilities of many Californians. In a state 
whe re the issues of illness and wellness are 
high on residents' priorities, Prop. 21S's 
approval should come as no surprise and 
cause linle ourrage. However, the situation 
IS complicated by the fact that the health 
care option in question is the medicinal use 
of marijuana - a substance that the federal 
government sees 3S having no medical bene-
fi ts and forbids anyone to cultivate, possess 
or consume. 

Over the last year, the Drug 
Enforcement Agency has placed California's 
medical mari juana movemenf-
which has been growing in force 

gerous and has no medicinal qualities. 
Marijuana hardly fits those criteria. Its 

derrimental effects are elaggerated; yes, it 
damages the body, just as smoking and alco-
hol abuse do, but who ever heard of some-
one overdosing on too many joints? The 
same cannot be said for other Schedule I 
drugs, which include ecstasy, LSD, mesca-
line, quaaludes and heroin. 

Furthermore, marijuana 's medical bene-
fits are well documented. Studies from the 
University of Califorrtia at San Francisco, 
the University of Michigan and Brown 
University have shown that cannabinoids, or 
drugs derived from cannabis, have excellent 
pain-killing properties and are not addictive, 
unlike opiates. Furthermore, smoked mari-
juana was shown in the Amwu of Intt17lll/ 

Mtdicinr to relieve many of the 
negative side effects associated 

and legitimacy - at the top of 
its hit list. Highly visible busts 
in the last month have targeted 
mar ijuana growers in Santa 
Cruz and San Diego, crippling 
communities' ability to distrib-
ute a drug that our state and 

PRO 
with chemotherapy. More stud-
ies on the efficacy of smoked 
marijuana are now being con-
ducted at UCSD. 

All of this has been accepted 
by California voters and law-
makers, who support the many 
medical marijuana programs these ci ties deem legal and ben-

eficial. 
Why is this happening? We have a con-

servative president in the White House: 
Shouldn't states' rights take precedence over 
the big bad federal government? And why 
don't D .e. lawmakers recognize the many 
studies that have shown marijuana to have 
beneficial medical uses? The fact is, the cur-
rent effo rt to stamp out medical marijuana is 
misguided, and the conflicting laws on the 
issue must be reconciled in order to best aid 
ai ling patients. 

T he D EA lists marijuana as a Schedule I 
drug, which is defined as a substance with a 
high potential for abuse and which lacks 
"currently accepted medical use in rreat-
ment in the United States." In other words, 

the drug is 
wildly dan-

around the state and are seeking to srream-
line and standardize the process by which is 
it grown and distributed to those in need. 
The City of San Diego, for example, is 
developing a registration system for 
patients. So why are the feds ripping up 
plants and threatening the growers with fed-

rescrl 
Marijuana is a dangerous drug that should 

be kept illegal in all circumstances 
By MELANIE HOHLFELD 

Senior Staff Writer 

Criticism of the U .S. narcotics policy 
could be mistaken for an American pastime. 
The latest spectacle pivots on the leg2lization 
of marijuana for medicinal purposes. 

Pro-marijuana groups would have the 
public believe that marijuana is the most 
effective analgesic agent available to 
patients. They would have the public believe 
health risks associated with marijuana are 
bertign compared to other substances. And 
they would be wrong. Or rrtisleading the 
public. Either way, these groups have 
ignored critical medical issues and ethics 
that have kept marijuana illegal. 

First, medically qualified patients already 
have access to the analgesic and 
therapeutic adv:antages of mari-

than cigarettes. A marijuana smoker 
increases his carboxyhaemoglobin concen-
tration, a measure of carbon monoxide poi-
soning, five times more than a cigarette 
smoker. A marijuana smoker inhales three 
times more tar and retains H percent more 
of the tar inhaled than a person smoking a 
cigarette. 

In addition to the adverse effects on your 
lungs, potential downside risks identified by 
the National Institutes of Health, the 
British Medical Association and the 
Institute of Medicine also include memory 
impairment, rapid heart rate, damaged psy-
chomotor capabilities, dependence and 
depression. 

The oruy reason then that marijuana 
could be approved for medicinal purposes is 

if marijuana provided pain relief 
and other therapeutic advan-

juana. Delta-9-tetrahydro-
cannabinol (also known as THC 
or Delta9-THC), the primary 
psychoactive agent in cannabis is 
av:ailable and legal for patients 
with demonsrrated medical need 
as synthetic rue. Its aliases 

(ON tages above and beyond the cur-rently available, federall y approved medicines, including synthetic THe. Marijuana has yet to scientifically demonstrate 
it provides therapeutic benefits 

include synthetic THC, dronabi-
nol and Marinol. In addition, patients have 
access to other analgesic drugs, including 
codeine and morphine. These drugs, 
including synthetic THe, are legal because 
they have undergone extensive controlled 
studies so that the risks involved with their 
consumption are well-understood by the 
medical commurtity and the Food and Drug 
Adrrtirtistration. 

Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule 
I drug (considered potentially addictive and 
with no current medical use) and is illegal for 
many reasons. While the public perceives 
marijuana use to be more bertign than other 
fonns of substance abuse, this could not be 
funher from the rruth. The most important 
difference between smoked marijuana and 
synthetic THC is the effect on your lungs. 

Smoked marijuana is dangerous, the 
potency of which has only increased in the 
last 15 years, according to Drug Watch 

International. 
Smoked marijuana 

has a greater con-
centration of 
carcinogenic 
benzan -
thracenes and 
benzpyrenes 

over synthetic THC or, as stQt-
ed by the 10M, there is no sci-

entific evidence that smoked marijuana pro-
vides any advantage over currently available 
rrea Ollents. 

This does not mean that clinical studies 
should be discouraged . Many medical 
experts, including the NIH, the 10M and 
researchers at the University of California at 
San Francisco agree that more controlled 
studies need to be initiated to understand the 
costs and benefits of marijuana smoking. 
However, nunt of these experts support the 
federal legalization of marijuana. Without 
further controlled studies to resolve the 
unidentified hanns or undiscovered gains of 
marijuana, legalization becomes a gamble. 
Priority No. 1 of the FDA is informing and 
protecting the public from potentially harm-
ful substances; it cannot legalize marijuana 
until the risks and benefits have been statisti-
cally quantified. 

The question then becomes: Given that 
synthetic THC is already available to qual-
ified patients, and given that marijuana has 
been shown to contain more carcinogens 
than cigarettes, and given that cannabis has 
not been proven to provide statistically sig-
nificant increases in pain relief over current 
medications, then why would some groups 

be pushing so hard to have marijua-
na available for medical consump-

tion prior to additional co n-
trolled studies? The answer is 
simply that these groups are 
searching for a back-door to 
the federal legalization of pot. 

Approving marijuana for 
medicinal purposes is the most 

effective way to punch holes in 
the legislation designed to 
keep marijuana illegal. Don't 
believe me? Have a look at 
California law and Prop. 215, 
the 1996 legislative initiative 
that legalized the medicinal 
use of marijuana in 
California . The initiative 
allows persons or their 
caregivers to grow on their 
own or possess marijuana 
for medicinal use when 
recommended written or 
orally for cancer, anorel!-
ia, AIDS, chronic pain, 
spasticity, glaucoma, 

anhritis, migraine or 
"any other illness for

though~ 
over a pint 

Chris Taylor 

A n Bodhran's is crowded tonight. The small pub has drawn in quite a few peo-
ple, including college students. 
The bouncer outside looks just 
like Colin Quinn, and is extreme-
ly friendly. He says that this is the 
perfect place for "a rtice pint and a 
good time." My friends and I have 
arrived early to get a good table 
and hear the local rrad (as Irish 
traditional music is called by many 
people here). 

Our table is full of classmates. 
We've all had a long day; classes 
have just started . Consequently, 
each of us has our own poison -
some Heineken, some gin and 
tonic and, of course, the obligato-
ry Guinness. Our conversation 
ranges from classes to politics, 
from light-hcarted jokes to seri ous 
discussion of world views. 

As we sit talking, the fiddle 
sings and the bodhran, the Irish 
drums, rumble thrOllgh the pub. 
T he singer del ivers Irish fo lk songs 
unabashedly and e\'cryonc joins in 
when they know the song. Though 
my folk music knO\ ledge is still 
li mited, I try to join III on a few 
well-known songs like "Finni gan'S 
\!\Iake" and "Danny Boy." V hen 
the band stops to drink their own 
pints, I notice several things. 

First, tllcre are no belligerently 
dmnk guys trying to score \vith 
scantily clad girls (who say they 
hate tht: obnoxiolls guys - bur end 
up going home with them anyway). 
In fact, no onc is picking up on 

anyone. This is no meat market. 
Everyone is dressed semi -casual 
and there are some suits and ties. 

Secondly, though tile beer is 
flowing from the taps like water, the 
first priority is not getting dnmk, 
but rather relaxing. Certairuy there 
are some folks who have had their 
fill of stout, but the aOllosphcre is 
much different from the Pabst-
slamming and any lce-shorgtm-
rung aOllosphere of the party scene 
in Pacific Beach. It seems as 
though getting drunk is second to 
enjoying the aOllosphere. 

Third, there is little hot-blood-
ed machismo. As I look up, two 
men run right into each other, 
spilling a good portion of their 
drinks. Immediately, both men 
apologize and both offer to buy 
the other a drink. 

It's definitely different than 
what I am used to. 

People say it all the time: Bars 
in the United States have a mali-
cious feel to them. They say that 
Americans want to get drunk as 
quickly as possible. American clubs 
are merely meat markets intended 
for guys and gi rls looking to score 
indiscriminately. -Though there is 
rruth in th is statement, to some 
exrent, I disagree . Oh, I'm sure a 
lot of it has to do \vith the hi gh 
drinking age, perhaps the lack of 
tradition and widespread culture . 
Understandably, most E uropean 
countries have a culture that 
includes alcohol as a regular part 
of the day, and mericans have ret 
to cOI;lp letely adopt this . 
I [owever, there is a more specific 
reason that Americans seem to 
have a more sinister a koholic 
scene. [ translate much of this 
problem to a lack of good pubs. 

The idea of the pub is one of the 
1Il0st smnn ingly social and yet 
clever im'cnuons ever. The pub 

does not cater as much to raging 
partiers as it centers on social gath-
er ings. Pu bs offer relaxation, 
fr iendship, mtL'iic and aOllO. phen.!. 
T hen it mixes in alcohol and su r~ 
gently. A great portion of the Irish 
population frequents pubs. That' a 
very obvious generalization, but has 
very strong factulll roqts. Going to 
the pub is not a weekend fiasco, bur 
a nightly unwindi ng from the 
srrcsscs of the day. Plenty of college 
students go to the clubs and bars to 
get smashed on the weekends, 
which last wltil the wee hours of 
the morrting. But after a day of 
rough classes or a hard job, the per-
fect place is not Club Perversion, 
but Flynn's or Kennedy's or one of 
the hundreds of pub that saturate 
the city srreets. There you chat 
with friends, have a couple pints, 
listen to music and return home 
without too much worry of a hang-
over for the next day's classes. 

With such a large portion of 
Ireland being - on average - in 
the mid -twenties, it seems incredi-
ble that such a relaxed, mellow 
atmosphere can be obtained. 
Anywhere in the world , young col-
lege age student are wroth ro be 
tOO calm. Perhaps the only expla-
nation is that, like most European 
countries - and unlike the State 
- there is a .. trang group of

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, ZOOZ 

Pint: Pub atmosphere lends itself to chats Pro: Federal government 
must respect states' wishes concmued from page 5 

Pabst or Narural Ice, there is no 
reason to drink your beer hastily. It 
IS almost an insult to voraciously 
down a Murphy's or Beamish. 
Everyone rakes their time, savors 
their beer, and thus much of the 
obnOXIOusness is averred . 

3. No self-respecting Irishman 
will drink Guinness from a can, and 
wlil not even go near the stout any-
where else in the world, including 
England, but especially the United 

tares. After some research, I have to 
Jgree that G uinness sent to the 

tates is just awful . Because of this 
rule, and working in conjunction 
with the previous rule, one must go 
to a pub to get Guinness and because 
they have to go to the pub to get it, 
they have to savor it all the more. 

4. Unless it is a very trendy pub, 
random pick-up lines or other sex-

ually motivated introductions are 
considered mildly rude. Th is i 
probably true because you 're both-
ering the person who is rrying to 
relax and have a good conversation 
with their friend . Though everyone 
is very friendly with each other 
when random conversations arise, 
you will be making a friend by 
doing so, nothing more. 

5. And as I learned the hard wav, 
never, ever mix Jameson whiskey 
with anything. Apparently, this is 
sacrilege and not until I received a 
stern talking to by the barrender 
did I realize this. 

Of course, these rules are bro-
ken from time to time, and even 
then, they are generalizations. But 
for whatever reason, the pub is held 
as almost a sacred instirution and is 
given its proper respects . 
Consequently, there is always a 
place to escape the loud dance clubs 

an.d sexually charged bars. 
The whole world has trendy 

clubs and sinister bars, but the 
placement of the pub in the center 
of many countries' drinking culrure 
has detinitely contributed to the 
view that alcohol is an acceptable 
instirution in society and not 
reserved for the desperate, the 
degenerate and the crazy college 
kids. 

The band finishes up with the 
national anthem and people begin 
leaving. The bouncer standing out-
side thanks everyone individually as 
they shuffle out of the pub. He tells 
most people to come back, and to a 
few women he jokes that if he was 
"only 10 years young and 10 stones 
lighter .... " Then he smiles and asks 
the one or two Americans in the 
pub if he will be seeing us again. 
We nod and say that we will defi-
nitely be back.

effective decriminalization - that 
is, the DEA could StOP raiding 
medical marijuana farms unless 
they have evidence that the mari -
juana grown there is making its 
way into less-than-needy hands. 
This approach may appeal to 
President Bush, who said in 2000 
that he believes "each state can 
choose that decision as they so 
choose." Perhaps if he were less 
preoccupied with important for-
eign policy issues, he would call 
the DEA and inform them of his 
well-reasoned political convic-
tion. 

stop taking much-needed medi-
cine Out of the hands of AIDS and 
cancer patients and instead devore 
their reso urces to preventing 
pregnant women from smoking 
crack and high schoolers from 
dropping dead from heroin over-
doses. 

On the other side of the pot 
divide, states and ciries must 
develop respon sible policies 
toward the production and distri-
bution of medical marijuana . 
Santa Cruz's laws require little 
verification of a patient's purport-
ed medical need, which could lead 
to its abuse. 

Con: Medical marijuana law lacks clarity 

That solution, however, is ten-
uous and hardly the most desir-
able. More reasonable would be 
changing marijuana's schedule 
classification so that doctors 
could prescribe it. For example, 
Schedule II drugs, such as cocaine 
and opium, are described as those 
with a high potential for abuse 
and a "currently accepted medical 
use wi th severe restrictions." A 
Schedule III classification would 
allow wider prescription and 
acknowledge that marijuana's 
potential for abuse and physical 
addiction are substantially lower 
than many other drugs. 

And finally, hot-under-the-
collar drug war proponents must 
stop claiming that medical mari -
juana programs are tantamount to 
or excuses for the legalization of 
pot. Most medical marijuana sup-
porters don 't want pot in the 
hands of the average joe any more 
than they want codeine (a 
Schedule I drug), ritalin (a 
Schedule II drug) or vicodin (a 
Schedule III drug) to be used by 
those who don't have a medical 
need for them.

illness for which marijuana pro-
vides relief." No prescriptions. No 
record-keeping. 

This statute ignores medical 
ethics and holds no one account-
able for the risks associated with 
takmg a drug. Because Prop. 215 
allows patients to grow cannabis 
at home, doctors are not monitor-
ing the amounts or potency of 
THC entering their bloodstream. 
T he absence of written prescrip-
tions and the ambiguity of "any

If improving patient care were 
the goal, groups would be asking 
questions to understand the true

si mply increase the prescri bed 
dosage) But these questions and 
medical ethics are ignored because 
the agendas of pro-medical mari-
juana groups are often complicated 
by desires to legalize marijuana for 
communities without medical 
need. 

Before considerations can be 
made for the legalization of mari-
juana, additional controlled srudies 
must be performed. There must be 
proven benefits of marijuana not 
offered by current treamlet1ts that 
eclipse the downside risks. 
Assuming these tasks are accom-
plished, federal legislators must 
close the legal loop-h oles that 
would effectively make POt legal for 
persons without medical cause. 

Until a national consensus is 
reached, however, the raids in 
California and other states where 
medical marijuana has been over-
whelmingly legalized by voters 
must stop. Federal agents must 

This issue cannot afford to be

are settled . That could be years, 
and in the meantime, people are 
suffering, and state law-abiding 
people are being persecuted and 
prosecuted by federal agents. Let's 
make this a priority, and make sure 
the will of Californians doesn't go 
up in smoke.

Shuttle: New buses are crowded with students 
cominued /rom page I 

a popular route for UCSD com-
muters because it provides a free 
alternative to parking on campus, 
riders say the route is often too 
busy to accommodate everyone. 

Trina Sodha, a Marshall college 
senior, is a regular passenger on the 
Cityshuttle. While she notes that 
the UCSD-sponsored route to 
campus runs more often and more 
efficiently than the County Transit 
Services routes, the buildup at 
some stops is often discouraging. 

"Nights are tough," she said. "It's 
re:Jily just a waiting game. It sucks." 

Passengers and drivers alike 
claim that more than 30 people will 
be waiting at a stop at a time, and 
that there have been instances 
where the shuttle has completely 
bypassed a stop beca use the bus was 
too full. 

"The buses are very crowded," 
sa id shuttle driver George 
Davidson. "When we have busloads 
of 50 or 60 people, we can't stop 
until people get off, even if there 
are 30 people waiting at a stop." 

Davidson and others cite the 
stops at Lebon/Palmilla and 
LebonINobel as the most crowded 
stopS on the route . 

Shuttle supervisor Frank Buono 
says that the parking and trans-
portation department is aware of 
the overcrowding and that the issue 
is currently being addressed. 

"Our goal is to improve the effi-
ciency of the service," he said_ "It 
Will take some additional time and 
planning." 

Cityshuttle route map 
The service operates from 7 a.m. to 12:15 a.m., Monday through 
Friday, during the academic year, Buses provide service to each 
suttle stop location every 15 minutes. 

Two additional shuttles have 
been running during peak hours in 
response to the heavy passenger 
volume, according to shuttle driver 
Alejandra Medina. 

While recognizing Cityshuttle's 
growing pains, Buono contends 
that the service has been a success 
based on the positive feedback his 
office has received. 

Kenrick Leung/Guardian 

"The response has been 
tremendous," he says. "Customers 
are using it and seem to be very 
happy that its available." 

Cityshuttle passengers agree 
that the route's advantages out-
weigh it's early-stage deficiencies. 

"I'm still going to take the shut-
tle anyways," Edwards said. 
"Afterall, it is free." 

Time: Instructors notice increase in tardiness 
comimled from page :1 

John Muir College sophomore 
Cole Paffett said, "Frankly, [short-
eni ng the passing periods] is not 
that smart , especially when you 
have more snldents on campus and 
small freshmen that I can step on 
when I'm trying to get to York." 

Srudents are not the only mem-
bers of the UCSD community feel-
ing burdened by the shorter passing 
period. Many staff members say they 
have noticed an increased amount of 
tardiness in their classes due to the 
shortened passing periods. 

A informal survey conducted by 
the G1Ulrdia71 showed that 17 of the 

30 lecrurers housed in York and 
Warren Lecture Halls who respond-
ed said that the new 10-minute pass-
ing periods have had a significant 
effect on their students' puncruality. 

N or all students are so passion-
ately opposed to the Academic 
Senate's decision, however. Emily 
Wick, an ERC junior, said that the 
shortened time between classes 
has had little impact on her, 
though she does sympathize with 
students whose classes are more 
spread our. 

"[The shortened passing peri-
ods] don't affect me that much 
this quarter," Wick said. "I think 

it's unfortunate, but I do under-
stand why [the Academic Senate] 
did it." 

Marshall junior Cheryl Andrade 
suggested that the shuttle system 
could be more efficient in aiding 
students in getting from one class 
to another on time. 

"They should put more buses 
in the [campusl loop and make 
them come every five minutes, 
because if you miss one shuttle 
you're automatically late," 
Andrade said. "Just walking from 
Warren Lecture Hall to the Social 
Science Building takes more than 
10 minutes."

and maki ng programs more conve· 
nient, accordi ng to Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph Watson. 

"One of our major priorities 
right now is a second pool at 
Canyon View," Watson said. 

Exactly what changes will be 
made to the recreational programs 
have not been decided. HPAL 
Chair and Director of Sporr 
Facilities Don Chadwick said that 
the Student Health C enter, 
Psychological Services and 
ResLife would also draw on infor-
mation from the survey. 

"We want (HPAL) to be a defin-
ing feature of life at UCSD," 
Watson said . "This is a major 
thrust of 
S tu d e n t 
Affairs." 

The survey 
highlighted dis-
tinct differences 
between men 
and women in 
their at titudes 
towa rds recre-
ation, as well as 
the di fferent 
activi ties they 
prefe r '. 
Therefore, dif·

ferent marketing strategies will be 
used towards each gender, accord· 
ing to Watson. 

"[The survey) will be evaluated 
progressively as we move through 
it," C hadwick said. " It is a goal of 
ours to uy to snare freshmen early 
on ... and uy to get them engaged 
in our programs." 

Watson said rnat he wanted 
more of a focus on promoting 
physical activities during Welcome 
Week. 

"We want a high profile, and we 
want all students involved in ir," 
Watson said about the HPAL pro-
gram. 

Watson said the HPAL survey, 
or a similar one, is to be conducted 
on a periodic ba is in the future so 
that changing trends can be mea-
sured. 

Of those polled in the study, 23 
percent said that finances were a 
barrier to an "active lifestyle," 
while 23 percent also said that 
bei ng self·conscious prevented 
them from having an "active 
lifestyle." Watson contends that 
informal and cheap programs 
should be offered to overcome such 
barriers. 

Chadwick said the HPAL pro· 
gram is an attempt to build on a 
base of athletic participation at 
UCSD . 

"The San Diego campus of the 
University of Cali fornia is pretty 
active when compared to orner 
universities," Chadwick said. "We 
have many more intramural teams 
and recreation classes than any 
other UC campus." 

T hurgood Marshall College 
sophomore Martin Storrow said 
that he was satisfied with the recre-
ational facilities and programs 
offered at UCSD. 

"I think they have a lot to offer," 
Starrow said . "I played intramural 
sofrball last year. It was really laid· 
back, even though my team lost." 

Graduate student Maria Cesena 
says that the price is right for the 
free programs. 

"I probably wouldn'r have done 
it if it had cost, like, $50," he said. 
"Bur it's free, so that's a big incen-
tive:'

I-House brings 
together students from 

around the world 

BY ~AR.J.A DEVRIES 
contributing writer 

As the old jolre goes, if you speak 
three languages, you're trilingual; if you 
speak two languages, you're bil ingual ; 
and if you speak one language ... you 're 
American - but not at International 
House. 

International House is UCSD's 
experiment in promoting diversity. This 
unique set of resident halls, located in the 
Pepper Canyon Apartments of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, was created to foster 
understanding and friendship among 
people from a wealth of backgrounds, 
countries and cultures. 

"It's like living in 10 different coun-
tries at once, but with all the conve-
niences of America," said Revelle college 
senior Chuck Hassenplug .. 

Over the past 14 years, the I-House 
• program has grown to include nearly 200 
students from over 20 countries, all of 

who~ Jive together with American stu-
~ t;? build their international commu-
nil}'- .' . 

"Since I didn't live on campus my first 
~ ~ I-House really was like my

WortDWl,a RootCVdt colloge senior in 
his secXind year at I-House, "1 became

before this,» he said. "California is like a 
droeam for me - the sun is always shin-
ing. There aren't campuses like this in 
Paris; there is no place for them. It's all so 
great, what can I say?" 

I-House residents from UCSD work 
hard to give the international students 
the fu ll Ameri ca n experience for which 
they came. T hc tradition of trick-or-
treating at Halloween is virtually 
unknown in the rest of the world, and has 
proved an exciting new activity for inter-
national students who participate for the 
first time through I-House. 

Last year, Wortman took his friends 
from I-House to his old high school for 
the HomecomillJ. football g21T).e, com-
plete with parade tloau and cheerleaders. 

"They 1VeR so excited, .. he said. "It was 
lib what they bad always seen in l)lOvies." 

til addition, the residerus are strongly 
enc:our.acd to participate in the program-
ming that is developed to further explore 
the difta:ent cultures and build friend-
ships. These include activities such as 
iDtramural sports, 1anguage tables, infor-

hile is a country generally not on the 
top of the list for most travelers - but 
it should be. Often forgotten by the rest 
of the world, Chile is the economic 

leader of SOUtll America. antiago contains 40 per-
cent of Chiles population (6 million), leaving tl1e 
ncx'l largest city wi th only 2 percent. Therefore, 
other than the capital, tl1e country appears to be 
untouched by man. Reaching up to 25,000 feet, the 
Andes run along the more tllan 2,OOO-rnile border 
on the east; the ocean swallows the west; and the 
Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, 
guards the north, leaving Chile a solitary country 
with a distinct culntre and Spanish lang11age. 

The country is on average only 150 miles wide, 
making the ocean accessible from just about any-
where. \Nithin tl1e country, traveling almost guar-

antee~ acti\~ ty. You can go backpacking around the 
bke .md gbcler of Torres del Paine, climb one of 
the 180 \'olcanoes, enjoy the world-renowned surf-
ing 111 Pichilelllu, sa,{dboard the dunes in the 
north, and of course, snowboard down the Andes. 

The Eductation Abroad Program brought mc 
to the modern city of Sanriago. The 9,000 city 
buses make a large contribution to the unbeliev-
able amount of pollution in the air, )¥hich at times 
hides lulls and buildings only blocks away. Most 
Chileans live at home until they are married, but if 
a student goes away to college, he or she will gen-
erally live with another family. The country is con-
servatively Catholic - divorce and abortion are 
I DO-percent illegal - and though many parents 
are strict with their daughters, there is a rejection 
of Puritan values. The night life that starts at 11 
p.m. has recently led to a reversal of the law against 
drinking in public because the authorities were just

fed up with throwing people in jail. Some sources 
say that "personal" use of marijuana is legal, and' at 
the University of Chile, it is hard not to smell the 
number of srudents that take advantage of this. 

The most memorable adventure I had was the 
fir t time 1 ventured over the Andes into 
Argentina. For quite some time, Argentina has had 
horrendous economic problems and the weekend T 
cho e to travel by myself, the banks decided to 
close. Since I left on the day of tl1e National 
Census in Chile, everything was closed, making it 
impossible to buy food . After seven hours in a van, 
I arrived in Mendoza hungry and without 
Argentine pesos. My legs took me as far as a beat-
up old hotel next to the bus station, bur for $5 I got 
a room and breakfast. The receptionist told me I 
could pay in the morrung :md tl1ere would be 
someone to exchange money. However, at check-
out, I was told by a different person to leave my 
passport and go out and find someolle to change 
my money. All the Automated Teller Machines had 
been bled dry and the ."casas de cambio" closed, 
but fornm3tely, after only a few hours I found 
someonc ar 3n intcrnational bus company who 
would change my Chilean pesos for Argentine. 

Srudying abroad involves unimaginable ups and 
downs, but overall I would recommend a program 
like EAP to everyone. Ot having enough money 
is no excuse, because renting a room for $300 in 
the nice area of Santiago will include utilities, food, 
laundry and most likely the Latin custom of maid 
service. For more information, lsabel Allende\; 
"The House of Spirits" gives an account of 
Chilean culture and recent histoty with a brutal 
dictatorship. Also visit th e International Center off

Professor teaches Arabic at UCSD 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 

Senior Staff Writer 

Arabic is spoken by hundreds of 
millions of people around the world, 
yet until now, it was not widely stud-
ied at UCSD. Thanks to Professor 
Sonia G hattas-Soliman, however, 
that is changing; the department of 
linguistics will now offer a four-
quarter, lower divi ion series in the 
study of Arabic. 

The linguistics department has 
long offered an independent study 
program in the many dialects of 
Arabic, but the twO- or four-unit 
courses were not applicable to the 
colleges' foreign language require-
ment. Nor were any literature class-
es offered in Arabic, though Arabic 
literature was studied in translation. 

However, recent poli tical devel-
opments in the M iddle East have 
increased attention on Arabic cul-
ture and piqued many students' 
curiosity about the language . 
Ghattas-Soliman, who also teaches 
Arabic at Grossmont Coll ege, 
noticed increased enroll ment in her 
classes after the Sept. II terrorist 
attacks. She proposed that UCS D's 
linguistics department offer Arabic 
language courses, and they agreed. 
This quarter, L IAB IA and IB are 
being offered, and as the year con-
ti nues, IC and I D will also be 
offered. 

Ghattas-Soliman is excited 
about universities' and students' 
increased interest in Arabic lan-
guage and culrure. 

"I think it's really very good 

because there is a lot of misunder-
standing," she said. "It's a very nice 
culture, and up to now probably 
what has been emphasized is the 
negative rather than the positive. 
Once people get to hear about all the 
different areas and aspects of Arabic 
culture, they are surprised because 
they find a lot of similarities also to 
different other cultures." 

T he courses teach srudents to 
read, wri te and speak Arabic - or at 
least one of the many varieties of the 
lanbruage. The language is acnlally 
divided into three versions: classical 
Arabic, in which the Koran is writ-
ten; standard Arabic, which is the 
written language throughout the 
Arabic-speaking world; and collo-

City of Hope holds third annual 5K for a cure 
By RUTH KOGEN 
Contributing Writer 

How many women do you 
know? Mothers, friends, sisters 
and girlfriends; cuunt them all . 
According to recent research, one 
in every eight of those women will 
develop breast cancer in her life-
time. But people are working to 
cure this disease, and now you can 
help, too. 

On Oct. 13 , the City of Hope is 
presenting the third annual 5K 
Walk and Fun Run at UCSD. The 
North Campus Recreation Area 
Track will be transformed into a 
mass of survivors and supporters, 
all walking towards a cure. 
Registration is at 6:45 a.m. and the 
walk begins at 8 a.m . If you can not 
attend the walk itself, there will be 

an awards ceremony and festival 
immediately following . tephanie 
Coolich, the assistant director of 
development at the City of Hope 

an Diego Office, say tha t along 
with the opportuniry to win a 
Harley, there will be clowns, face 
painters, interactive games, vendor 
booths and music for all to enjo),. 
One hundred percent of the pro-
ceeds from the festival and walk go 
directly to fu nd research and other 
programs at the City of Hope. 

What is the City of Hope and 
how can you be sure that your 
ITI<>ney and effort is going to a wor-
thy cause' 

The organization was founded 
in 1913 when a sma ll group of sym-
pathetic citizens constructed twO 
tents at the foot of the San Gabriel 
Mountains for people suffering

from tuberculosis. These original 
founders believed in equal oppor-
mnity for medical care, as well as 
the right to a healthy life. 

The City ofl lope now conducts 
research inro the treatment and 
prevention of many life-threaten-
ing dise,1ses, including diabetes, 
HTV/AfDS, various forms of can-

Acne? Your health questions answered Arabic: Student says language i 
relatively not difficult to learn 

To your 
health 
Erika Hallen-Baino 

What causes aOle and what 
are the best topical treat-
ments? 

Acne results from the interplay 
of many factors; hormones, oily 
skin, your genetic disposition and 
hair follicle design. Unfortunately, 
there is no cure for acne, but there 
are a variety of treaonents once the 
type of acne is identified (acne is 
classified as non-inAammatory or 
inflammatory). 

The basic lesion is a comedo. A 
blackhead, or open comedo, fOmlS 
when oil and loose cells combine to 
form a rough insoluble protein 
(keratin) that is the principal matter 
of hair and nails. 

A white head, or closed come-
do, is the result of inflammation 
or damage to the follicle. The 
area surrounding the comedo may 
become raised, red and inflamed, 
thus forming a papule. If the foili -
c1e is damaged or ruptured - this 
includes popping zits - the con-
tellts may leak Out and penetrate 
surrounding tissue, forming cysts 
and nodules. 

T he topical therapy recom-
mended for non-innammatory 
acne are products available over 
th e counter, including products 

I-House: 
Culture nights 

are a big hit 
with students

organization that organizes various 
philanthropic activities. Past works 
have included beach cleanups, 
feeding the homeless and fundrais-
ing for inner-city lcids. Any sm-
dents at UCSD are welcome to 
participate in the projects that the 
organization does throughout the 
year. 

American, European and Asian 
culture nights have also proved 
successful in the past, showcasing 
fooG from various countries, as 
well as educational displays, music, 
dance and entertainment. These 
have proved to be excellent oppor-
tunities for students to explore the 
culmres of those around them. 
while at the same time helping 
others to appreciate and under-
stand their own. 

One of I-House's Resident 
Advisors, Thurgood Marshall col-
lege senior Sandra Nabmura, con-
siders this an opportunity to be a 
mentor to the students involved in 
the program. She herself is no 
stranger to diversity. 

"I was born and raised in Lima, 
Peru, to a family of Asian immi-
grants," she said. "So since an early 
age, I have been aware of the 
impact that cultural diversity has 
on the development of an individ-
ual's character. 

"I strongly feel that it has been 
the everyday interaction with fel -
low students, friends and room-
mates sharing their own cultures 
and family traditions that have 
made my residence at the 
international House an extremely 
valuable ellperience." 

Many students are finding that 
they learn many new things from 
just the people in their own apart-
ments.

ting across the table from an Italian

containing benzoyl peroxide or 
salicylic acid . Benzoyl pe roxide is 
widely used and less than I per-
cent of users experience adverse 
effects, including dryness and 
irritation, ca using them to Stop 
treatment. 

One disadvantage to consider 
is that benzoyl peroxide is metab-
olized into hydrogen peroxide 
and benzoic acid, which can cause 
skin bleaching and can bleach 
hair and fabric. Keep in mind 
there are many strengths of ben-
zoyl peroxide available. 

Salicylic acid concentrations 
greater than 2 percent should be 
avoided because it may damage 
skin tissue. Do not use both ben-
zoyl peroxide and salicylic acid 
together; th is will increase adverse 
effects. These products are avail-
able in many forms at any drug 
store. 

Inflammatory acne can be 
treated with a topical antibiotic (a 
doctors visit is required), which 
suppresses the acne. 
Unfortunately, antibiotic resis-
tance is a concern and is seen most 
commonly with topical ery-
thromycin . Benwyl peroxide may 
be added in combination. 
Combination products are avail-
able by prescri ption. 

Regardless of the treatment 
chosen, an average of six to eight 
weeks is the suggested time period 
to observe progress before switch-
ing to another treatment. T.11k to 
the pharmacist at your local store, 
as they ca n provide treatment 
advice. 

Should I be concerned about 
antibiotic resistance'? 

Yes. antibiotics are a unique 
drug class in that misuse with some 
patients can prevent others from 
using them at all. In this sense, 
antibiotics are societal drugs, and 
overuse, particularly of broad spec-
trum antibiotics like amoxici ilin 
and penicillin, places us all at risk by 
hastening the emergence of antibi-
otic resistance. 

The origin of many drug-resis-
tant infections comes from hospi-
tals into the community following 
increased use of antibiotics in a 
community. When an infection 
does not respond ro initial treat-
ment, antibiotic resistance begins 
to emerge because the initial antibi-
otic treatment destroyed only some 
of the bacteria, leaving the most 
resistant bacteria behind to multi -
ply and strengthen the infection. 

To reduce your risk for infection, 
only take antibiotics when the pres-
ence of bacteria is determined to be 
the cause of an iliness. Taking 
antibiotics for colds or flu only 
increases the rate of drug resistance. 

Another cause of antibiotic 
resistance is the administration of 
antibiotics to healthy farm animals 
to promote growth and prevent 
infections. Research indicates that 
antibiotic resistant strains devel -
oped on fa rms spread through ani-
mal feces into the water supply 
and from there to humans. To end 
non-therapeutic u e of antibiotics

quial-spoken Arabic. The last varies 
widely throughout the world, but 
the five main dialects are those of 
Egypt, Iraq, the Arabian peninsula, 
North Africa and the Levant. 

"The Egyptian dialect is the 
one which is most known and most 
understood," Ghattas-Soliman 
said. "So I decided that along with 
the standard Arabic that the stu-
dents learn, I was going to incorpo-
rate the Egyptian-Arabic, but not 
disregard the other dia lects. The 
emphasis wili be on Egyptian ." 

Ghattas-Soliman also said she 
hopes UCSD's literature depart-
ment will offer lower and upper 
division courses in Arabic so stu-
dents can continue their study of 
the language past the ba.sics. 

Students enrolled in the classes 
this quarter are excited about the 
program. Muir senior Nelly Salem 
said she signed up for LIAB I A as 
soon as she heard about it. because 
she is Egyptian and though she 
speaks colloquial Arabic, she wants 
to understand the Koran. 

"[The class) is interesting," she 
said, "but I wish there was more 
emphasis on standard Arabic." 

Salem also said she thinks 
Arabic is a good subject for stu-
dents to study because it isn't diffi-
cult to learn. 

"The challenges are mainly bias-
es," Salem said. "If you have the pas-
sion and you want to learn it, it 
would be an easy language ro learn." 

Hunaid Gurji, a graduate st\!-
denr in bioengineering, is a;so of

Arab descent. His previous knowl-
edge of Arabic, however, was limit-
ed to the writing system and Its 
pronunciation. 

" I don 't like to read somethin l,: 
and not understand it," he ~a id . 
"Different translations lof the 
Koran] in English mL-:!n different 
things, but if you read it straight up 
in Arabic, you're getting the pures t 
form of it." He added, "I think it's 
very important for omcollt! to 
know their native tongue." 

Academic pursuits we re al 0 
citetl by students a reasons for 
enrolling. ].R. Osborn is a graduate 
student in communication and 
works with Islamic calligraphy, 
wherein a passage of Arabic text is 
shaped like an object. He IS inter-
ested in learning more Arabic to 
better understand this art fo rm. 

"It's nice that you can finall y 
learn it," Osborn · said. " But it; 
questionable as to what the re,ISOIlS 
are for why it's being taught." 

Alluding to government agen-
cies such as the FBI, CIA and The 
State Departme nt heavily recruit-
ing speakers of Arabic, he said , 
"Better not to study anything OUl 
of fear." 

G hattas-Soliman noted th ~tt 
studenrs in the classes have many 
reasons for taking it, including job 
opportunities in international rela-
tions, law and translation. 

" I hope that this will be a vcry

The new UCSD policy of unify-
ing the on-campus living experience 
by requiring each resident to pur-
chase a meal plan has increased the 
cost of living on campus, and many 
international students could not 
afford to attend this year. In addi-
tion, this limits the amount of cook-
ing that many will do, decreasing a 
vital element of cultural sharing that 
characterizes (·House. 

For those who wish to be 
involved in the vast international 
community on campus, the 
International Center works with 1-
House to provide a number of ser-
vices and activities that are available 

to all students. The International 
Club, open to students from all cul-
tures, seeks to increase awareness 
and interaction between American 
and international students. The 
International Parmers Program 
matches an American and an inter· 
national student based on similar 
interests. 

Lindsay Harris, an English 
international student who interns 
at the International Student and 
Scholar Office, encourages stu· 
dents to be involved with these cul-
twal programs. 

"There are approximately 1,200 
students from over 70 different 
countries here at UCSD," she said . 
"They are an invaluable resource for 
anyone interested in different coun-
tries, travel, cross-cultural commu-
nication or language." 

So whether you plan to study 
abroad someday or are JUSt interest-
ed in a great recipe for Miso soup, 
the international community on 
campus contains everything your 
looking for. To keep up to date with

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 19 

Volleyball: Tritons improve conference record to 7 .. 2 
continued from page 24 

the Antelopes' .075 . The score was 
equally lopsided when UCSD took 
an easy 30-17 victory. 

The Tritons played well enough 
in the second game to roll to a 30-
19 victory, thanks in large part to 
the impotent Grand Canyon 
offense, which managed only nine 
kills and committed nine errors for 
a hitting percentage of .000. 

In game three, UCSD held on 
for a 30-26 victory, in which the 
tea m seemed to grow so mew ha t 
lackadaisical in its play against the 
lesser opponent. 

Despite the lack of parity, Triton 
head coach Duncan McFarland 
maintains that his team can still ben-
efit from these rypes of matches. 

"We were working this week on 
our team chemistry," he said . "We 
wanted to work on loosening up and 
being more confident on the court, 
and getting our offense running 
faster and better than it has been." 

Whatever adjustment to the 
offense that was made had a defi-
nite effect on Friday night against 
the Wildcats. 

The Tritons opened with a dom-
inating first game, and Bonnie 
Wilson , Katie Hogan, Stacy 
Dunsmore and Jennie Wilson got 
on their way to double digits in kills 
while rolling 30-20. UCSD contin-
ued its dominance in game [wo with 
a 30-23 victory. With the same 
inability to close the match that 
plagued the Tritons the previous 
night, UCSD lost the third game 
29-31, but the team sealed the match 
with a 30-24 win in game four. 

The night was statistically 
notable for UCSD, which boasted 
several incredible performances. 
Bonnie Wilson established a season-
high for the team with 26 kills, while 
sister Jennie Wilson added 19. 
Defensively, UCSD racked up the 
digs when Denelle Smalley, Jennie 
Wilson and Lauren Mills joined 
Dunsmore and setter Teresa Ohta in 
double digits. Dunsmore's big night 
bodes well for the Tritons, whose 
second-consecutive solid match sug-
gests shes found her groove. 

" I'm trying to get back to my 
old self, and it all came our 
tonight," Dunsmore said. 

Ohta also found her form with 
62 assists on the night to establish a 
new season high. However, shc 
gave the credit to her teammates. 

"It means that our hitters are 
putting balls away," Ohta said. 

That job was being done just as 
well the following night against UC 
Davis when the Tritons opened 
quickly, again winning the first 
game 30-20 with Hogan killing 
eight balls early to pace her team. 

The Aggies made an attempt to 
play competi rive volleyball, but 
UCSD had no problem finishing 
them off in the final [wo games (30-
25,30-25). 

Jennie Wilson led the team with 
16 kills, and Dunsmore added 11 
kills of her own, due in large part to 
the setting of Ohta, who racked up 
52 assists in just three games. Hogan 
gathered a total of IO kills and an 
attacking percentage of .471 . 

Despite their statistics, however, 
the only number that will bring the 

Sarah M. Stauch/Guardian 

Rolling on: Sophomore Katie Hogan 
(No. 7) had 12 krlls during the Tritons' 
game against the Wldcats on Oct 4. 
Tritons success this season is 15. 
Every one of UCSD 's 15 player> 
will have to come together and 
learn to trust each other in order 
for this team to play to its potenrial, 
accordingly to Hogan. 

"I think we 've taken a lot of time 
aside to try to gel as a team," H ogan 
said. " Beyond JUSt practi ce, we 
started finding diffe rent ways we 
could get together and form illorc 
unity so it'll show on the court ... I 
think that outside help has trans-
ferred into games and matches." 

Next weekend, the Tritons will 
take on San Francisco State and 
Sonoma State OCt. I I and 12 . Th~ 
Tritons use a growing sense of 
unity to attempt to bring home a 
pair of victorie , as well a e tablish 
the momentum they' ll need to keep 
this run going.

Tritons drop two in a row 
Men's soccer suffers two away-game losses 

By MATT RYAN 
Staff Writer 

Jut a week ago, everything was under 
control for the Tritons, but with a recent 
two-game slide, UCSD ca n't afford to lose 
many more. Losses to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Sept. 29 and surpri singly to C hico 
Smte on Oct. 4 make the road more difficult 
for the men's soccer team to make the play-
offs. The good news is the Tritons, now 6-4 
overall and 4-4 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic As ociation, still are on top in the 
South Di\"lsion with plenty of games left in 
the season. 

The trip to Dominguez Hills has never 
been easy for the Tritons, c pecially this year, 
with the Toros playing undefeated . CSU 
DOllunguez H ills played like the better team 
when thcy blanked the Tritons 4-0. It was a 
rough loss because it showed UCSD how it 
matched up with the best. 

In the game, the Toros led 3-0 at ha lf-
tllne. They came out and scored quickly 
when SU Dominguez Hills' Scon White 
and Eduardo Serrano scored in the first 15 
minutes of play. Juventino Morfin and Chris 
Wimmer added goals later on to put d,e 
game out of reach . 

With the loss to the Taros still fresh on 
their minds, the Tritons traveled nordl to 

face Chico State. 
UCS D began strongly, and UCSD's 

David Ower scored his tirst goa l of the sea-
son to g ive the Tritons a 1-0 lead when the 
Wildcat goalkeeper tried to clear the ball; it 
went underneath a Chico State pbyers foot 
and right to Ower. However, the Wildcats 
never bid down - instead, they fought back 
and tied the game on Rusty Phillips's goal to 
start the second half. 

With the game tied at I-I ; the Tritons 
were called for a hand-ball penalty in the 
63 rd minute of play, and Wildcat player 
Chris Wondolowski was left with a direct 
kick. With a nice shot ro the corner, 
Wondolowski was able to get it passed the 
Triton goalkeeper. Chico State managed to 
hold off the Tritons and win the game 2- 1. 

It was a heartbreaking loss for the Tri tons 
because it was the first Wildcat victory 
against UCSD since they jo ined the CCAA 
in 2000. 

ext up for UCSD is UC Davis, :tfter 
which the Tritons come back to San Diego 
for four-straight home games. With UCSD's 
desire to win and its strong work ethic, the 
playoffs are sti ll \vithin its grasp. It is now a 
crucial time in their schedule to make a push 
fo r the playoffs, or come November the 
Tritons will be sitting at home thinking 
about what could have been.

the tcam competi tion. They do not receive 
a poi nt total , and the points they earn are 
shifted down to the next eligible runner. 
The team's point total is calculated by total-
ing the points of its top five runners. 

The Triton men finished with 508 toral 
points, but it was Division II's sixth-ranked 
Chico State that ran away with the compe-
tition, placing five of their seven runners in 
the top IS and finishing with 42 points. 
Eastern Oregon and Willamette battled for 
second place, with the former coming out 
on top at 95 to 97 . 

Leading the Triton women was fresh-
man Michelle DiMeo, who finished the 
5,OOO-meter course in 50th place with a 
time of 18:52.42 . Following DiMeo was fel -
low Triton Kara Cross, whose 18:57.90 was 
good enough for 59th place overall in a 
field of 319 runners. Rounding out the 
UCSD fi eld was Jennifer Turk in 100th, 
Caren Jordan in 106th, Emily Vala-Haynes 
in I 34th, Stephanie Marton in 135th and 
Kate Branson in 140th place. 

Northwest College, placing its top five 
runners in the top 25, handily beat out the 
35-team field with 48 points. Chico State 
followed Northwest with 84 points, and 
Azusa Pacific took third with 160 points. 
T he Triton women finished with 427 
points. 

After opening the season with a home 
dual meet agai nst Point LOII1l, the Tritons 
have competed in five consecutive road 

meets, including one in Minnesota last 
week. The traveling will come to a halt in 
the coming rwo weeks, however, with the 
Tritons competing at the UCSD Triton 
Classic on Oct. 12 and the U SD Alumni 
5K on Oct. 19, the final rwo tunc::-ups 
before the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships at Cal State 
Bakersfield on Oct. 26. 

"[The T riton Classic) is about as big as I 
really see [the team] being able to handle," 
Van Arsdale said. "It's going to be every-
thing that our team needs in order to make 
the next step in their training progression. 
We're getting to the point where we need 
to take our best racers forward ." 

The Triton Classic is a crucial meet 
because UCSD will compete with its entire 
roster, and th e participating teams' perfor-
mances will determine which squads will 
compete at conference championships and 
beyond, if they should advance. According 
to Van Arsdale, the bar is set higher this 
season than last year, when the women 
advanced to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association West Regional and the 
men finished 15th at the NCAA National 
Championships. 

"[We expect) that they raise [expecta-
tions] just like they did this past week -
without fear," Van Arsdale said. "As far as 
where they're going to place, can both 
teams be tOP three? Yes, for sure. Bur you're 
only as good as your last race, so we 'll see 
for this week."

largest meet in

By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men's and women's 
cross country, fi elding rwo youth-
ful squads, fini shed 19th and 16th, 
respectively, at the Willamene 
University Invitational at Bush's 
Pasture Park in Salem, Ore. The 
largest collegiate cross country 
meet in the ,"Vest featured the 
largest field of participants in its 
28-year history, boasting over 
1,000 runners. 

The meet was divided into di f-
ferent races for Division I and 
non-Division I teams, the latter of 
which included two nationally-
ranked teams for both Division 1I 
and m in the men's race, including 
the 22nd-ranked Tritons . Three 
nationally-ranked Divisio n II 
squads were also represented for 
the women, one of which was the 
12th-ranked UCSD. 

According to head coach Ted 
Van Arsdale , UCSD was split 
into "A" and "B" teams of 20 
runners each based on their per-
formances in early-season time 
trials . The teams then alternate 
competitions. At this past 
Saturday'S meet, the "B" teams 
competed with a roster predomi-
nan tly of freshmen. 

"They were very brave," Van 
Arsdale said. "It 's been a process 
- we put them in a Division I

meet with UC Irvine right afte r 
our first meet of the year against 
Point Lorna. All of them had to 
step up. We kind of hardened 
them early to the caliber of com-
petition. I thought that they 
showed no concern for athletes 
not on their team - they were 
aggressive and they showed the 
ski lls we've prepared them with." 

On the men's side, Triton Eric 
Nilsen finished the 8,OOO-meter 
course in 80th place out of over 
366 runners , with a time of 
26:05.24. Teammates Tov Fisher-
Kirsh ner, Richey Hansen and 
Samuel Miller followed in 99th, 
12 / st and 126th , respectively. 
Aaron Stonestrom was close 
behind in 127th place, and 

Steven Chen and Aaron Buttery 
followed at 134th and 261 st , 
respectively. 

A runner receives the same 
number of points as his or her

those runners who run unattached

Give me 
something to 
write about 

at UCSD 
pum's 
points 

Anu Kumar 

P lea e excuse the quality of my few prior columns. I apologize for the boredom 
lhat they may have caused, but it's 
hard to write J good column with-
out J decent topic. 

Like mo t of the columns I have 
wrinen, [ didn't have a clue as far as 
what to write about wltiI the late 
hours of the night before it was due. 

U\ Vhy do I have so much trOu-
ble \\'Ith 'thinking of a topic to write 
abuut:" you 111Ight ask. 

U\ "-hy isn't there anything inter-
esting at UCSD to write about?" L 

\\'oul~1 respond. (I know it 's bad to 
respond to .l que,uon with another 
quesuon. but I did it anyway.) 

There\; little gOing on here. It's 
week two of the fall quarter, and it 
seems like the GlltlrdwlI has already 
touched on most of the topics cu~­
rendy surroundmg UCSD atllletics. 

T here haven't been any big scan-
dal or controversies in the local 
sport~ world for us to talk about. 
r\cmally, I doubt there Will be a tory 
about trouble concerning UCSD 
sport~ until people show that they 
acmally care enough about the 
Tritons for the athletic department 
to pull strings and land recruits that 
will shake this powerful conference. 

I have to say that it would be 
nice to actually report on UCSD 
breaking rules in trying to build 
strong athletic teams. It would def-
initely be a change (and maybe a 
dream) to wri te about the topics 
that come up at prestigious colle-
giate sports organizations. 

But for now, instead of writing 
about an All-American wide 
receiver driving a tricked-out Suv, 
I'll have to stick wi th the topics 
that the Tritons provide me with. 

So ladies of the women's soccer 
team, which surprisingly lost two of 
three games prior to Sunday's 
matchup at UC Davis: You guys bet-
ter start winning so I can talk about 
the dynasty that might be in the 
making. Until the Tritons start win-
ning and look like the two-time-
defending national champions they 
are, I can't even write about how the 
soccer team is likely to three-peat. 

And women's volleyball : 
Continue with this strong run 
through your schedule to attract 
more energizing crowds at RIMAC 
Arena. The abnormally large atten-
dance at sporting events like volley-
ball games early this year has been 
touched on, but the Guardiall can 't 
continue to talk about the change 
that UCSD might be making with-
out a heart-filled team getting past 
conference-rival Cal State San 
Bernardino and making a strong 
postsea on push. 

I Iopefully, men's soccer, wate r 
polo or cross country \vill soon give 
me with something to write about. 
Potential also lies on the basketball 
court and on the baseball field, 
where teams nught provide news-
worthy performances and attract the 
eyes of UC D later in the year. 

I !owever, until things become 
more interesting here at Triton 
Town, I'll be left with a blank Word 
document for too long, and my five 
faithful readers of this column will 
reach a new level of boredom.

Tritons beat Chico State and 
UC Davis on consecutive nights 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The women's volleyball team began to find its groove again last 
week with victories against Grand Canyon University, Chico State 
and UC Davis. The Tritons improved to 13 -3 overall and 7-2 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association, putting them in a second 
place tie in the CCAA and earning them a ranking as the 10th best 
team in Division II. 

Coming off a loss to top-ranked Cal State San Bernardino the pre-
vious weekend, the Tritons went into their Oct. 22 match with the 
Antelopes of GCU looking to nlrn things around. Establishing a pat-
tern that would last the entire week, UCSD did just that in the first 
game. The Tritons attacked an incredible .425 !lS a team, compared to

The women's soccer team 
recovered from a stunning loss 
to Cal State Los Angeles on 
Sept. 27 when the Tritons pulled 
out a 2- 1 overtime victory over 
Cal State Dominguez Hills twO 
days later. However, UCS D suf-
fe red its second setback of the 
season after losing to the 
Wildc!lts of Chico State on Oct. 
4. 

Agai nst CSU Dominguez 
Hills, the Tritons gave up the first 
goal of the game in the 26th 
minute when the Taros' o rma 
Gutierrez took a loose b!l ll and 
put it at the back of the net. In the 
second half, UCSD responded in 
the 56th minute. UCSD junior 
Kris ten Conahan took a cross 
from sophomore Britini Wenck 
and headed the ball past CSU 
Dominguez Hills goalkeeper 
Alb!l Garcia. 

The Tritons then went to their 
first overtime session of the ea-

Men's water polo beats Princeton 
Three Tritons enjoy homecoming as UCSD holds on to the victory 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

Three members of the UCSD 
men's water polo team felt right at 
home Oct. 4 . The site of 
Bellarmine Prep High School in 
San Jose, Calif., was supposed to 
be neutral for the Tritons' g!l l11e 
aga inst East Coast power 
Princeton. However, Triton 
sophomores Kevin Smoker and 
Travis Boettner, as well a fresh-
man Jesse Casellini, are all 
Ballarmine Prep graduates. 

"It was very nice to go play in 
the pool where I learned how to 
play polo," Smoker said. 

The Tigers played close with 
the Tritons throughout most of 

the game. Standout 2-meter 
offensive player Sean Foster came 
out hot for the Tigers, but could-
n 't adapt to the Triton defense, 
which made some mid-game 
adjustments to shut Foster down. 

"After he scored a few goals on 
us, we changed our defense in 
order to shut him down," said 
senior goalie Lance Onken. 

After the firs t quarter, the 
ga me was tied at two. The Tri tons 
then took a 4-3 lead going into 
halftime. After Princeton tied the 
game at four in the third quarter, 
UCSD enior Bryon Spicer took 
control. 

With an assist by Onken on a 
counterattack, Spicer scored to 
give the Tritons the 5-4 lead. 

Minutes later, on an assist from 
Smoker, Spicer -again found the 
back of the net, this time on a 1 D-

. meter shot. Spicer's two goals 
broke the game open and gave 
UCSD a 6-4 advantage. 

"The shots felt good," Spicer 
said of his back-to-back goals. 

The Tritons never looked back 
after that point. Outscoring 
Princeton 3-2 in the final period , 
UCSD held on for the 9-6 victory. 

"Spicer's two goals in the 'ec-
ond half were key," Smoker said 
after the game. 

The Tritons continued to use a 
6-for-6 substirution pattern that 
not only kept players fresh, but 
allowed 12 Thton field players to 
play significant minutes. 

Sophomore Brandon Borsa paced 
the balanced UCSD scoring 
attack this time, tallying a t<ltal of 
three goals in the game . 

Along with the chance to playa 
top ranked team from the East 
Coast, the Tritons were exited to 
use the game agai nst the Tigers as 
a springboa rd going into the 
NorCal Tournament, where they 
faced some of the top teams in the 
country this past weekend . 

"(This game) was a nice W!lrm-
up for the tournament," Spicer 
said. 

With the win over Princeton, 
UCSD has won six-straight games 
and improved its record to 10-6 
on the season after a trying 4-6 
start.
