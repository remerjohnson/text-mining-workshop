UC LAB 
FINDS NEW 

FUEL SOURCE 
By Sneha Bhamre 

CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

cientists at the UC-managed Los 
Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico recently announced the dis-
covery of a cheaper fuel cell catalyst 
that uses a cobalt composite instead of 
the more traditional and vastly more 
expensive platinum-based compound. 

Unlike a battery, fuel cells do not 
need to be recharged and will continue 
to run as long as reactants are sup-
plied. The electrochemical process is 
two to three times more efficient than 
fuel burning and emits no pollutants 
- only heat and water. 

The traditional platinum catalyst 
fuel cell generates electricity similar to 
a battery through two half-reactions. 
However, without a catalyst, the reac-
tion to create electricity does not take 
place, making platinum arguably the 
most important component of the fuel 
cell. This compon~nt also contributes a 
great deal to the system's cost.

Traditionally, UCSD's campus is 
known to be empty Halloween week-
end, with students either leaving fo r 
parties off campus or travelling to 
other schools for parnes. 

On Oct. 27, however, the univer- . 
sity's first joint college festival, Revelle 
and Warren Rock PC Plaza, hosted 
activities on Library Walk all day and 
held a highly anticipated concert fea-
turing four bands. The lineup was a 
diverse mix that included two local 
bands, Grand Ole Party and The 
Donkeys, as well as underground hip-
hop group Living Legends and the 
headliners Nada Surf. 

"We made it a priority to support 
local San Diego bands:' Revelle College 
Sophomore Senator Sarah Chang said. 
"But we also wanted to have a diverse 
selection of music to get people to 
come out:' 

While the local and lesser-known 
Grand Ole Party and The Donkeys 
drew only a scant crowd, Living 
Legends attracted an intense follOwing

Campus Joins National 
AIDS Treatment Database 

Office Keeps Injured Students Walking

. UCSD teams up with 
researchers around the 
country to identify the 
most effective AIDS 
treatments.

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Campus HIV and AIDS 
researchers recently announced 
their participation in a national 
collaborative information-shar-
ing database on AIDS treatments 
to better ascertain which ones are 
most effective. 

The UCSD project is led by 
adjunct professor of medicine 
Richard Haubrich and medical 
researcher ' Christopher Matthews. 
both of whom are already mem-
bers of the UCSD AIDS Research 
Institute. 

The program measures the effec-
tiveness of treatments for thousands 
of patients in everyday practice, 
compared to about 100 selected for 
clinical trials. 

"This is an ongoing collabora-
tion that we just received permanent 
funding for," Haubrich said. 

UCSD had' a similar database 
for several years before it integrated 
with the national network, at which 
point initial pilot funding jump-
started the program.

"We received a five-year grant 
from the [National Institutes of 
Health) to move forward ." Haubrich 
said. 

The Owen Clinic. which works 
with over 2,600 patients. is the base 
site at UCSD for the database that 
communicates with the network.. 

Due to the variations through 
which HIV manifests, keep-
ing record of individual patients' 
responses to treatments is key. 

These kinds of trials are con-
ducted on a short-term basis. While 
this information may be useful in 
starting treatments. doctors say that 
they need more information on 
long-term benefits and side effects. 

New antiretroviraJ drugs have 
allowed HIV-infected patients to 
live longer. although high blood 
pressure, diabetes. heart disease and 
other ailments are becoming more 
apparent. according to The New 
York Times. 

The network connect seyen si tes:

University in Boston. John Hopkins 
University in Baltimore, UC San 
Francisco and the Un.iversity of

The Office for Students with 
Disabilities has received a significant 
amount of student criticism in response 
to its recent suspension of services to 
temporarily disabled students. 

Due to a limited number of golf 
carts and trained student drivers, 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Development Brian J. Murray said that 
it was impossible for OSD to provide 
rides to and from class for temporar-
ily disabled students - students with 
such afflictions such as a broken foot 
or leg. pulled tendon or sprain. 

"This fall quarter there was a 
marked increased demand for ser-
vice coupled with a lack of available. 
trained student drivers:' Murray stated 
in an e-mail. "Hence, [there was a] 
necessity to limit cart transport on a 
priority basis to those with permanent 
disability, followed by those with needs 
fo r cart transport of multi-months 
duration." 

Other students with short-term 
mobility issues were placed on a wait-
list for service, according to Murray. 

Despite this, disabled students 
across campus are angry with the 
office's decis.ion. 

Emily Catalano. a Thurgood 
Marshall College senior. broke her foot 
about two weeks ago. When she went 
into the office wearing a cast and hob-
bling on crutches. she said an employ-
ee told her about the wait list, but said,

Social Cue Found in 

Bird Brains 
UCSD is responsible for pio-

neering a study that has recently 
made a discovery in animal behav-
ior research : Scientists have identi-
fied brain cells that influence bird 
sociability. ' 

Headed by James Goodson, 
as 0 iate professor of psychol-
ogy and neuroscience, the research 
found that specialized neurons in 
the brain reacted differently in birds 
that live in colonies than in the ir 
more solitary neighbors. _ 

The study found that vasotoci n 
neurons selectively promote posi-
tive affiliation, and that the amiable 
species have a greater number of the 
specified ne urons and an increased 
baseline ac tivity, plac ing these birds 
in a continual "social mood." 

"And whi Ie the observations were 
made in birds, they should apply 
to many other animals, including 
humans, since the cells are present 
in almost a ll vertebrates and the 
brain ci rcui ts that regulate the basic 
forms of social behavior are strik-
ingly similar," Goodson sa id. 

Cup of Coffee a Day 
Keeps Diabetes Away 

There may be good news for 
coffee addicts, according to a 
UCSD study, which fOljnd th at 
past and present drinkers of caf-
feinated coffee have as much as a 
60-percent reduction in diabetes 
risk, compared with control sub-
je ts who never drank offee. 

While the study wasn't the first 
to discover that coffee drinking was 
inversely proportional to diabeteS 
risk, UCSD's researchers were the 
first to include test patients with 
high levels of blood sugar, who 
were consequently at high risk for 
Type-II diabetes. 

In 2004, a Finnish study sug-
gested that drinking three to four 
cups of coffee a day could reduce 
the risk ofType-1I diabetes by about 
30 percent. 

Resu lts from 15 studies that 
evaluated over 200,000 partic ipants 
combined found -. si milar positive 
effects, where the highest coffee 
consumption yielded the lowest risk 
for diabetes susceptibility, accord-
ing to the Harva rd School of Public 
Health. 
. American Diabetes Association 

spokesman Larry Deeb said he 
is enthusiastic about the findings 
because of their positive implica-
tions for people combatting dia-
betes. 

"People with diabetes and those 
at risk for developi ng diabetes have 
enough [thingsl to worry about: 
Deeb said. "It is nice to know that 
coffee isn't one of them, and it may 
actually help lower risk." 

However, it is too early to 
recommend drinking coffee as a 
hea lth strategy for lowering the 
risk of diabetes, accordi ng to the 
study's director, Besa Smith. 

Currentl y, it is unclear how cof-
fee influences diabetes risk, she 
said. 

Furthe r research is needed to 
isolate the compo ne nts respon-
sible for the protective effects, 
which are most likely not due to 
caffeine.

Energy Dept. Funds Additional Fuel Research 
â¢ CELL, from page 1 

The high price of platinum has 
been a roadblock for the commercial 
viability of fuel cells. 

"One big obstacle for fuel cells to 
become more practical is the cost, 
especially the cost of precious metals~ 
project leader Piot r Zelenay said. 

As a precious metal, platinum is 
subject to rocketing market prices, 
and is currently priced at $38 per 
gram. Cobah, on the other hand, is 
far less expensive, at only four cents 
per gram. The abundance of cobalt 
resources worldwide and its low cost 
make cobalt a very attractive catalyst. 
according to Zelenay. 

Another non -precious metal that 
has shown some catalytic activity is 
iron, which led to the decision to test 
cobalt, Zelenay said. 

"The reason why we selected 
cobalt first was the good proven cata-
lytic activity in other non-precious 
metals in other catalytic systems." he 
said. 

Cobalt yielded surprising results 
for a non-precious metal, according 
to Zelenay. It was able to withstand 
the acidic environment of the fuel cell 
without degrading Like iron, and was 
proven to remain stable for several 
hundred hours. 

However, as promising as this 
discovery is, it is not yet the ulti-
mate solution for battling fuel cell 
costs while maintaining performance, 
Zelenay said. The key point of the 
experiment was to show the durabil-
ity of the catalyst, not the efficiency. 

The fact that cobalt worked as 
part of the catalyst opens up an 
entirely new avenue of looking at 
non-precious metals as possibLe cata-
lyst sources, he said. 

The actual amount of electricity 
that was produced from the cobalt 
catalyst is not yet at practical levels for 
commercial use. 

For LANL, the next step "requires 
not the development of new catalysts, 
but in tllis particular case, ... the 

work of the structure of the catalyst." 
Zelenay said. 

I n order to be able to continue wi th 
that research, the U.S. Department of 
Energy awarded $ 100 million for fuel 
cell research to 2S different projects 
nationwide last week, including mul-
tiple projects at Los Alamos. 

LANL is a multidisciplinary 
research facility that looks at solv-
ing energy- and environment-related 
problems. Zelenay and research part-
ner Rajesh Bashyam mainly focus on 
polymer electrolyte fuel cells, which 
are more hopeful sources of alter-
nate energy mainly due to their low 
heat output and high energy density. 
According to Zelenay, these fuel cells 
have been seen as a possible alter-
native energy source in a variety of 
sectors, including transportation, por-
table devices, military uses, residential 
power and space.

Due in part to student complaints, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs

that OSD has decided to "transfer

A.S. Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Lindsay Root broke her

dais made her physically come three 
times to their office while she was on 
crutches to fiU out paperwork. 

Then, the office forced Root to 
wait until her orthopedic urgeon 
had faxed over all her medical docu-
mentation before they would begin 
to help her. 

Then, once all of Root's work was 
complete, she discovered that as far as 
the rides went, she was "completely on 
their time" because the "rides either 
get you to your next class late or make 

you leave your first cia s early:' 
. Both Watson and Murray said 

they were concerned about the com-
plaints. 

"OSO and its director are com-
mitted to providing responsive and 
effective service to each and every 
student to the best of their ability and 
resources in respectful and positive 
ways." Watson stated. 

According to Murray, student 
complaints will be carefully reviewed 
and addressed. 

Murray recommended that all 
further complaints about OSD be sent 
directly to Director Roberta Gimblett 
via e-mail or campus mail.

Endorsement 

W ith the Nov. 7 election just weeks away, the Guardian editorial board weighs in on the gubernatorial race and analyzes the better part of the statewide measures on the ballot, including 
a bill requiring parental notification, one that would tax California oil 
production and the Legislature's bid to "Rebuild California:' 

Arnold's Comeback 
l ust a year ago, the Schwarzenegger administra-tion was atrophying, voters had just rejected the governor's four special-election ballot measures, is approval ratings had plummeted to record lows 
and political pundits were ribbing him with the brand 
"One-terminator." But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
has since managed to shake his political trouncing 
from last November, proving that through centrist 
policy and philosophy he shouJd receive another term 
at California's helm. 

In seeking re-election, as in the 2003 recall, 
Schwarzenegger is assuring a bipartisan Sacramento 
by displaying both drive and compromise to oft -stub-
born Democrat . The only difference, this time, is his 
track record. 

for the first time in years, raising the minimum wage 
and establishing long-term initiatives to battle global 
warming and improve state health care. 

The challenging candidate, Phil Angelides, calls 
Schwarzenegger's leadership a fraud. The Democratic 
state treasurer's campaign has tried to appeal to 
California's scorn of conservatives by connecting 
Schwarzenegger to President George W. Bush, as if the 
governor had been parading a bipartisan facade. 

While it is true that chwarzenegger has proven 
politically cloudy on some issues - such as the loom-
ing state budget deficit as well as his inconsistencies 
and nonspecific plans on immigralion - Angelides 
still has no definitive answers for his opponent. To 
solve the budget gap, Angelides has taken the politi-
cally unpopuJar route of taxation. His straight-shooter 
image will not match the legislative camaraderie 
chwarzenegger has built. Even Democrats show no 

spark in their, support of Angelides, marked by Los 
Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's endorsement 
holdout until September. 

JEN NIFER H SUlGUARD:/:A:N~--------.::::;;~ 

chwanenegger's strongman stance against unions 
and the Legi lature during last November's election 
proved a disaster, and the governor admitted ~t. He 
has since reconciled with his constituents, and his 
achievements in the last year have proven that his 
flexible agenda can weaken the state's party lines for 
a greater good. Schwarzeneggec's pragmatism has 
allowed him to maneuver hot-button issues with 
less flak. For example, he assumed a conservative 
stance on gay marriage while distancing himself from 
Republicans on stem cell research. In the meantime, 
Schwanenegger has delivered a state budget on tinle 

Schwarzenegger, however, has been able to walk 
both the conservative and liberal worlds since his elec-
tion ih 2003. While his midterm experience proved 
rocky; the governor has demonstrated a politically 
balanced tenure and mentality that eams him the 
right to another term. 

WHAT IT DOES: 
Earmarks fuel tax revenues for various 
transportation projects. 
WHY WE SUPPORT IT: 
The bill encourages fiscal responSibility 
with only a small cost in liquidity. 

I n 2002, Californians passed Proposition 42, which specifies that most of the state's fuel taxes - about $3 billion annually - be used 
for transportation improvements instead of going 
to the state's general fund. But in the face of a bud-
get crisis, Sacramento has suspended this transfer 
twice in four years, siphoning funds from trans-
portation into education and social services. 

Proposition 1 A would make such realloca-
tions more difficult, treating those transfers 
as loans to the general fund that would need 
to be repaid in full - with interest. While the 
Legislature could sti ll pull an emergency loan 
with a two-thirds majority, the state would not 
be able to draw from the Proposition 42 money 
unless previous emergency transfers had been 
repaid in full. Furthermore, only two such 

transfers wouJd be permitted every 10 years. 
Proposition 42 dedicated fuel taxes to trans-

portation projects for a reason: so that new free-
ways, road improvements and transit systems 
would be paid for by the people who use them. 
Proposition I A would lock this sensible system 
into place. , 

It's become common practice during hard 
fiscal times to transfer money from transporta-
tion to whatever other program needs the cash. 
But doing so makes it easier for the legislature 
and the governor to gloss over poor budgetary 
decisions in other areas. 

While budget flexibility is a good thing to 
have in an emergency, Sacramento needs fis-
cal discipline - and Proposition IA is a good 
compromise.

WHAT IT DOES: 
Provides $19.9 billion in bonds for road, 
highway and public transportation proj-
ects. 

P roposition I B is part of the "Rebuild California" package promoted by the state Legislature and Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. Such bipartisan cooperation 
is rare in California, and voters shouJd recog-
nize the reason for its existence - California's 
huge transportation infrastructure badly needs 
updating and maintenance. As the population 
continues to surge, congestion becomes an ever-
worsening problem that requires more than the 
currently inadequate funding to alleviate. As a 
resuJt of years of neglect, California's roads and 
highways are sliding into disrepaiI, something all 
Californians, who spend an estimated 500,000 
hours per day sitting in traffic, must recognize. 
The need is clearly demonstrated by the wide 
range of support for the measure, including both 
major political parties and the state Chamber of 
Commerce. 

Although Proposition 1 B is the largest bond 
measure ever put before California voters, it is 
a crucial one, and even if voters pass all of the 
"Rebuild California" bond measures, the state will 
remain below the recommended 6 percent debt 
c;eiling. The measure's balance between funding 
for highway congestion relief and road improve-
ments - just over $11 billion - and funding for 
public transportation - $4 billion - adequately 
represents both sides of the private/public trans-
portation debate without facrificing either. It 
also provides funding for ~ing pollution

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

YES PROP. ID 
WHAT IT DOES: 
Issues a $10.4 billion bond to be used in K-12 
and college facilities repair and construction. 

WHY WE SUPPORT IT: 
California's education facilities are in poor shape 
and desperately need the cash . 

H ousing for the poor and emergency shelters for groups such as bat-tered women have always been touchy issues, and should be addressed _ in a fiscally responsible, realistic manner - thus, Proposition IC is 
not the answer. The initialive adds $3 biUion in new state government debt and 
will do little to help low-income California families afford hOUSing. 

W hen it comes to education, fiscal liberalism is an easy sell. Investment in today's class-rooms will allow us to reap the rewards of 
economic success in the future . Spending correctly, 
however, has made Proposition ) D's passage more 
contentious. 

When the state buys bonds, California taxpayers pay back the money to the 
tune of about $2 for every $) spent. Another governmen.t housing program 
will spend too much money on bureaucracy, making it difficult for every fam -
ily that needs the money to actually obtain it. Also, hidden in the proposition 
- designed 10 create affordable hOUSing and help seniors and the disabled pay 
for their own homes - is an ineievant $400 million project to improve parks 
across the state. 

If we're going to add more debt to California's credit cards, it shouJd be 
for a well-planned and well-written measure, which this proposition is not. 
ResponSible voters should vote no on Proposition 1 C. 

Overal l, Proposition ID will repair 31,000 class-
rooms and build 9,500 new classrooms. The University 
of California, specifically, would receive a much-
needed windfall of cash with Proposition 10, which 
would provide $890 million to the system. (UCSD 
would get about $94.5 million from the bond.) The 
university's facilities, along with those of its sister 
systems, California State University and California 
Community College systems, are fading in terms of 
technology and architecture. 

WHAT JT DOES: 
Enacts harsher punishments for sex 
offenders, including lifetime GPS 
tracking. 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
Despite a handful of good points, 
the measure is wildly unrealistic . 

A lthough increasing punishments for sex offenders is a worthwhile goal, the supporters of Proposition 83 have chosen a faulty vehicle. 
Aside from the potentially constitutional issue of 

lifetime G PS tracking. the measure has several flaws 
that prevent this board from endorsing it. Most impor-
tantly, the proposition prevents registered sex offenders 
- including those who have not molested children 
- from living within 2,000 feet of any school or park, 
essentially forcing them to relocate to more rural and 
suburban areas, which generally have less policing 
ability because of smaller programs with fewer staff 
and less funding. or into homelessness. Data also 
demonstrate that the vast majority of child sex offend-
ers molest children who are known to them person-
ally, usually a family member or friend, not strangers. 
Under the measure, communities are also allowed to 
set further boundary restrictions, pushing past offend-
ers into even smaller areas. 

Proposition 83 wouJd also have unknown fis-
cal effects up to several hundred million doUars per 

[ PROP 83, page 7] 

WHAT IT DOES: 
Requires parental notification of a 
minor abortion 48 hours before the 
procedure can be perfonned. 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
This measure wasn't worth support-
ing in 2005 and its potential effects 
haven't changed.

OPINIONS 

Opponenls of Proposition 10 contend that the 
initialive is needlessly careless, fo rcing California _ 
into a deeper budget hole. Critics are instead advo-
cating more efficient use of existing facilities. But 
some necessities go beyond improvement, including 
roofs and bathrooms that don't leak, two problems 
that have become an unfortunate staple in alifornia 
classrooms. 

Budgetary responsibility is key here, and the colos-
sal fmancial scope of Proposition 10 could easily lead 
to slapdash spending. But withholding much-needed 
funds from California's ailing education system in the 
name of caution is sinful. 

P roposition 85, a measure nearly identical to 2005's failed Proposition 73, is back, another attempt al changing the California constitution 
to require parental notification 48 hours before a minor 
can receive an abortion unless she receives a judicial 
waiver. This year, supporters have attempted to soften 
the political controversy of the initiative by removing 
the language defining a fetus as an "unborn child~ 
but the measure remains part of a broader attempt to 
restrict reproductive rights. 

This obstacle to a safe, legal abortion wouJd only 
increase the risk of physical harm to any California teen 
seeking one. Most pregnant teenagers, around 70 per-
cent, according to researchers from UC San Fran.cisco, 
already involve their parents in decisions about their 
pregnancies (even more involve some trusted adult). 
Teens who don't may have an important reason, includ-
ing abuse in the home or extremely anti-abortion 
parents whose notification wouJd effeclively resuJt in a 
consent requirement. Notably, Proposition 85 provides 
protection to minors who are coerced into having an

6 OPINION 

WHAT IT DOES: 
Raises the excise tax on cigarettes by $2.60 a pack; 
provides $2 billion for vanous health services. 
WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
A ta hike is unlikely to discourage smoking; the bill 
al 0 lacks spending guarantees; too many nders. 

C omc November, California voters should grind Proposition 86 into the ground like a dying ciga-rette butt. Although a tax that goes toward such 
C3U. es as helping kids stop moking and improving the 
state health care system seems noble, any voter who reads 
between the lines can see that it is a loophole- ridden, 
bureaucratic attempt at regulating tobacco that ends up 
feeding special intere ts. 

Although evidence shows that increasing the cost of 
cigarettes prevents people from beginning to smoke, espe-
cially people with low discretionary incomes like children, 
the prohibitively expensive $2.60 tax is unlikely to result in 
vast numbers of quitters, especially since nicotine has been 
proven extremely addictive - in fact, the measure unfairly 
targets this often-scapegoated population. 

Perhaps the most negative aspect of Proposition 86,

however, is the fact that it will increase crime and mug-
gling - from both Mexico and states bordering California 
- because such a huge price in crease would create an 
increased black-market demand for cheap tobacco. 

Although some of the funding would go to tobacco-use 
prevention programs and health insurance programs for 
children, the vast majority would be funneled to hospitals 
for emergency and trauma care - an important destina-
tion for funding. to be sure, but not something for which 
smokers alone should be forced to pay. Also, buried in the 
bill are prOvisions that allow hospitals to avoid antitrust 
laws under certain circumstances - ideas that might 
deserve more exploration, but do not belong in this mea-
sure. 

Backed by big-name star power - former President Bill Clinton appeared in a pro-87 TV spot, and Ben Affleck and Barack Obama have 
toured the state in support of the bill - Proposition . 
87 is being sold as part of a larger effort to reduce the 
use of petroleum. While it is a worthy goal, the bill is 
worked out in such a way that it will do very little to 
reduce demand. 

The meat of Proposition 87 is a 1.5 to 6 percent tax 
to be levied on California oil production, with the rate 
varying with the amount of oil produced in the state. 
The funds from this tax - between $225 million and 
$485 million, accord ing to the Legislative Analyst's 
Office - would be spent on research and production 
incentives for alternative energy sources, as well as 
energy-efficient technologies and alternative-energy 
vehicles. 

But instead of encouraging oil companies to gradu-
ally wean themselves from pelroleum, the tax pinch 
wi ll most likely end up puUing dollars from the aver-
age consumer's wallet. Proposition 87 tries to protect

WHAT IT DOES: 
Prohibits use of eminent domain for anything 
but direct public use of property; redefmes 
"jUSt compensation." 

- WHY WE-oPPOSE IT: 
The law, while well-intended, would make even 
basic regulation prohibitively expensive. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

The authors of Proposition 90 mean well. But instead of reducing the abuse of eminent domain laws - the intent of the measure - the law 
would greatly complicate the process of regulation, and 
probably end up costing the state billions of dollars in 
lawsuits. 

project. It puts the burden of proof of public use on the 
government, ensuring that eminent domain will not be 
used lightly. Had the bill stopped there, it might have 
earned this board's endorsement. 

The proposition is a response to a 2005 U.S. Supreme 
Court decision that greatly expanded a government's 
ability to use its right of eminent domain - a govern-
ment's ability to seize private holdings for public use. 
The court ruled 5-4 that private land could be seized 
and turned over to private developers, greatly expanding 
the meaning of "public use" in such cases. 

Proposition 90 attempts to limit that broad power, 
prohibiting state and local governments from seizing 
or condemning private property to promote a private 

But Proposition 90 also has significant flaws. It 
defines "just compensation" in such a way that gov-
ernments might be liable for "theoretical" property 
value loss. For example, it might be argued that a 
commonplace zoning ordinance would lower property 
values, opening governments up to massive numbers 
of potential lawsuits . Such a definition would make 
many necessary zoning and environmental regulations 
almost impossible to implement, especially for smaller 
municipalities. 

While the idea behind Proposition 90 is a good one, 
the bill is a poor implementation.

rity, a critical concern for a state that 
houses two of the largest ports in the 
country. 

The funding will also be dis-
tributed fairly evenly across the 
state, making a true investment in 
the entire state's infrastructure as 
opposed to a few large cities, an 
important reason why the dollar 

amount of the bond needs to be 
large to accomplish such a goal. Since 
1990, voters have approved only $5 
billion in state bonds for transporta-
tion. which is one reason California 
has an estimated $l60-billion need 
for upgraded transportation and 
infrastructure. Proposition 1 B is an 
important step forward in rectify-
ing one of California's most pressing 
statewide problems.

by the measUR, which would lump 
lower-risk and higher-risk offenders 
into the same group. would impose 
a formidable cost on the state. Even 
though the state would be allowed to

Despite these flaws, the measure 
beneficially increases penalties, pro-
viding longer sentences for some sex 
offenses and prohibiting probation 
for others, including spousal rape, 
as well as fOCUSing more attention 
on habitual offenders. However, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 
thel California state Legislature 
have already addressed many of 
these concerns in SB 1128 and SB 
1178, which accomplish most of 
the same things as Proposition 83 
with reduced state cost, including

Tax ,on Oil

Unreasonable 
â¢ PROP 87, from page 6 
Californians from inflated gasoline 
prices by prohibiting oil producers 
from simply passing the extra costs 
on to consumers. But oil refineries 
face no such restriction, and rathe.r 
than discouraging oil consumption, 
the tax will simply encourage refm-
eries to import gasoline from out 
of state. 

Reducing both our dependence 
on petroleum and the amount of 
carbon dioxide we produce is an 
admirable idea, but PropOSition 87 is 
not the way to do it. If the state wants 
to use market (orca to redUce petro-
leum use, it should implement a "car-
bon tax" on carbon dioxide release, 
like the BTU tax Clinton proposed 
during his preSidency. Production-
based oil taxes simply won't work.

Californians should vote no on

of making other voices louder. 

Even other unions, such as the 
California Teachers Association, 
find the proposition worrisome, 
unsure if the donation limits for 
individuals and groups apply ,to 
them. If the restrictions do apply, 
it would dramatically lower their 
voice of their union compared to 
otbers - probably a reason why the 
CTA is opposed to the proposition. 

Proposition 89 also does nothing 
to prevent wealthy candidates from 
using as much of their own money 
as they want in a public campaign . . 
This means a less wealthy candidate 
wbo manages to get public fmanc-
ing could still face an uphill battle 
running against a rich candidate 
who could outspend a public candi-
date many times over. 

This is one of the goals of public 
financing in political campaigns: to 
make sure that candidates aren't just 
wealthy Indivi4uals who want to 
maintain their own power. Without 
a provision to this effect, Proposition 
89 lacks teeth serious enough for 
real reform. 

While political fund raising des-
. perately needs reform, Proposition 
89 is not the answer. California 
needs to rework p-:>litical fundrais-
ing in a way tbat guarantees that 
the public, and not unions or any 
other special-interest groups, funds 
campaigns.

ductors that involves the direct con -
version of sunlight into energy - to 
generate its power. 

Far away from view on the roof-
top of the building, there are two dif-
ferent systems being used to generate 
energy from solar power: a skyline 
and a solar quilt. The skyline is the 
large panel commonLy associated 
with solar technology, which is tilted 
and uses its angle to take in more 
sunlight while the solar quilt absorbs 
light by laying flat on the rooftop. 

"The skyline has been proven to 
be more efficient when comparing the 
two, although both are very impor-
tant for the project; said Dave Weil, 
director of Building Commissioning 
and Sustain ability for the project. 

With all the concern regarding 
American oil consumption, solar 
power is often hailed as one pos-

sible source of the 
renewable energy 
on which the 

will 
one day have to relr 

More and more people are becom-
ing aware of the fact that oil and natu -
ral ga es will evennla!ly run out, and 
that other sources for electricity must 
be taken into consideration . UCSD 
has won numerou s awards over the 
years for energy efficiency and is 
widely recognized as a leader in the 
implementation of green practices 
across all levels of campus operation. 
According to Weil, UCSD, like each 
of the UC campuses, is deeply inter-
ested in energy efficiency. 

In July 2003, the UC Board of 
Regents unanimously voted in favor 
of a Clean Energy and Green Building 
policy, which stated that 10 mega-
watts of renewable energy, equivalent 
to the power used by 5,000 homes, 
be installed across the system's 10 
campuses, with each campus generat-
ing a total of one megawatt. UCSD is 
currently in the process of drafting 
contract documents, forming what is 
called a Power Purchase Agreement, 
involving private investors in funding 
the solar eoergy project. 

"A federal bill was passed 

glVtng investors [a 1 30 
percent tax credit for solar ener-

g)';' Weil aid. "ThiS tax credit is a 
great incentIve for prIvate investors to 
fund solar energy projects:' 

The rationale for the tax incentive 
is that private interest in the project 
makes it a much more viable project. 
However, solar power does have its 
drawbacks, the two main problems 
being cost and efficiency. Currently, 
the price of installation is very high 
and the solar panel can only get 10 to 
15 percent of their solar energy con-
verted into electricity. The total cost 
of the Powell Solar Energy Project 
was $81 ,500. 

"Right now it would take . 20 
years to make that money back;' said 
physics professor Kim Griest, who 
teaches a class on energy and the 
environment. 

However, because the demand 
is increasing, the price is expected 
to decrease in the next 10 to 15 
years. Efficiency is also expected to 
increase. 

"The fuel is free; solar is 
clean and terrorist-proor.

ing the fact that the

by anyone, unlike oil and natural 
gases the United States is receiving 
from foreign countries. Although 
solar energy currently has some dis-
advantages, it's expected to become 
more widely used in the years to 
come, due to continued technology 
and research. 

The Powell Solar Energy Project 
isn't the only plan for energy efficien-
cy on campus, and program coordi -
nators are trying hard to inform stu -
dents about methods to curb energy 
waste. 

"We want students to conserve 
and know that we're doing a lot and 
working on getting more renewable 
eoergy; Weil said. 

"Right now it's not in the con-
sciousness of the majority of the 
people," -Griest said. "If we want to 
live here, we have to take care of it," 
he said.

movie flights of fancy into reality. 
. When the duo came up with the 
idea about 20 years ago, Foucan and 
Belle intended Parkour, the name 
of the sporl, to be a lifestyle as 

well as a discipline to combat nega -
tive energy. omeone who practices 
Parkour is ca lled a traceur, and hi s 
objective is to move as efficiently as 
possible from point A to point B. 

UCSD has its own group of stu-
dents and local resi dents who come 
to campus every weekend to prac -
tice Parkour, which 100 ely trans -
lates to "free running." The free run -
ning isn't on treadmills or around a 
track, though . Instead, it's done in 
areas with little free space and a lot 
of obstacles. The traceur's goal is to 
achieve fluidity of movement in the 
les -than -optimal environment. 

Athletes at Parkour practi c-
es, referred to as jams, work on 
aligning fitness of body and mind . 
Concentration and strength are 
critical, since scaling bUildings and 
practicing moves against concrete 
backdrops necessarily entails risk. 
The men on the team ensure their 
own safety by st rength training 
beforehand and exerci ing within 
their limits. 

"If you don't become stronger 
before you do this, then you're just 
going to crew yourself over, injure

MO~V, OCTOBER 30, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Students Find Freedom in Unusual Sport 
â¢ PARKOUR, from page 8 
yourself, and not be able to practice 
anymore," Revelle CoUege senior 
and Parkour member Silverton 
Nguyen said . "You'd have to take, 
like, four months off because of a 
twisted ankle or something." 

Parkour groups are remarkably 
laid-back and lack hierarchy, adher-
ing to a philosophy expressed by 
co-creator Foucan: "no violence, no 
competition, no groups, no chiefs:' 

"There really is no reason to try 
to outdo each other because that 
can lead to dangerous stutr.' guyen 
said. 

Thurgood Marshall College soph-
omore Michael Barrett added hi own 
rationale for not turning the sport 
into a competition: "There's always 
someone on the Lnternet who can do 
way more than you can." 

The most interesting aspect of 
this discipline, however, is that new 
members learn by watching; nobody 
teaches them. Nguyen, who started 
the UCSD Parkour team with his 
friend, says that the most he'U ever do 
is make suggestions. 

"r don't train anyone at all; , 
just give people tips on what to do 
and what not to do," Nguyen said. 
"People just learn on their own. 
Anyone that's interested, they just 
come and join us. We don't really tTy 
to recruit anyone." 

The group does not have an 
established roster, either. "People 
come and go whenever they want;' 
Nguyen said. "It's the beginning of 
the year, so if people come more 
than twice r guess you could call 
that the core." 

Although Parkour requires high 
levels of concentration, strength and 
agility, practicioners consider the 
rewards well worth the effort. 

"It is one of the best workouts . I 
ever did; that's probably why I keep 
doing it," Nguyen said. 

HYDIE CHEUNG/GUARDIAN 
Parkour practitioner Adam Martin practices his moues on one wa/l of the 'Main Gym. The 
practices attempt to translate mental concentration into smooth kinestheties. 

Barrett commented along similar 
lines. "I've done a lot of sports in 
my life, so this is kind of the culmi -
nation of it," Barrett said. "AU the 
muscles are used here, and you get 
cardio, and you get strength train-
ing. I mainly did rock climbing and 
swimming and stuff. This puts them 
together." 

Keegan Gahbra, a freshman 

at Torrey Pines High School who 
comes to the UCSD jams, enjoys 
Parkour as a release. "If I'm having 
a bad day or something, I'll go out 
and do Parkour and it'll be my free -
dom," Gahbra said. 

Freedom seems to be the ope rat -
ing word in Parkour. The discipline's 
rules encourage the men to take 
advantage of every opportunity to 
develop their skills. Practice for 

Parkour members at times means 
doing things like jumping over the 
walls at Center Hall just to reach the 
drinking fountain . 

"It's fun to me;' said Juan Casiano, 
a sophomore at Mesa College who 
also attends jams. "I've always liked 
to come around and the way I see 
some of these guys move around 
anything, tbat gets me going. It's 
reaUy inspirational."

SITE SEEN I 
THE WHALEY-
---HOUSE 

The Whaley House has been the destination of intrepid explorers, willing to traverse the realm of the 
paranormal, for years. Built in 1857, it is 
considered to be one of the most historically 
significant houses in San Diego, and one of 
the most haunted houses in America. It was 
originally the Whaley family residence, but 
has since served as San Diego's first theater, 
the county courthouse and the Whaley and 
Crosthwaite General Store. 

In its 1 SO years of existence, the house 
has accumulated quite a retinue of ghostly 
inhabitants. Before the house's construction, 
James Robinson - or Â·Yankee Jim" - was 
hanged on the plot of the land over which 
the house was built. Thomas Whaley, the 
original owner, reported hearing heavy 
footsteps and decided it was Robinson's 
ghost. Tourists have also reported seeing a 
little girl who reportedly broke her neck on 
a clothesline by accident while playing with 
the Whaley children, a spotted dog that may 
be Dolly Varden, the Whaley's terrier, and 
even Thomas Whaley himself. 

Don't let experiences with the Haunted 
Mansion at Disneyland fool you; this house 
is the real thing. Behind its white-paneled 
exterior lies a long history of ghosts and 
haunting with dozens of tourguides willing 
to affirm its validity.

The Convocation is open to the public. 
Philosopher and scientist Robert T. Pennock

Convocation on Intelligent Design Creationism. 

He is the author ToU'eroj Babel: The Ef,iJence

addition, in September 2005, Dr. Pennock was called as an expert witness in 
"Kitzmiller et al V. Dover Area School Board." The suit tested the constitutionality 
of a policy that allowed the teaching of intelligent design creationism in a public

14 SPORTS 

Parting Words from NBA 
Royalty Trou'ble Student 
~ COLUMN, from page 16 
a lot nicer instead of brush.ing this 
meek commoner off. It would have 
been more pleasant - not to mention 
classier - for him to have said, "After 
the game, kid." Instead, he got a couple 
of cheap pregame laughs, and I got a 
big "fuck you:' 

I'm not sure Nash's harsh parting 
words fit the mold of the NBAl; criteria 
for the MYP, and I'm positive he didn't 
adhere to the protocol that every two-

from this debacle is that sports stars 
should be admired from afar and we 
houldn't expect anything of their per-

sonalities. Players are primarily ath-
letes, and any tact or personable skills 
they possess are definitely public rela-
tions pluses. Their main function is to 
put the ball in the basket, and if they're 
as good as Nash is, it doesn't really 
matter what degree of jerk they are. If 
a player was that great with diplomatic 
relations, he1::l be negotiating a dis-

armament pact for 
the United Nations 

time MVP follows 
when addressing 
the media. He 
handled the situ-
ation very poorly, 
and I wonder if 
his callousness 
was justified. ICI 
like to think no, 
because while he 
probably forgot 
the event after r 

h was sprawled out 
without a care in the 

world, absorbed in the 
realization of his own 

instead of playing 
basketball. 

Although a bat-
tle between two out- . 
standing Western 
Conference foes 
raged before me, my 
pregame experience 
with Nash preoccu-

greatness?' 

was out of his sight, I felt lousy for 
some time after. He's the NBA star, 
and I'm the college reporter, so I'm 
sure he's run into many more eager 
journalists than I've run into profes-
ional athletes. Furthermore, a ges-

ture of kindness wouldn't have hurt 
him, but his uncouth behavior .was 
an unfortunately rude introduction to 
profes ional sport journalism. 

After further brooding about the 
situation, I realize that Nash's reaction 
was mild compared to some sports 
personalities. I couldn't imagine get-
ting flak from Dennis Rodman or atti-
tude from Terrell Owens. I certainly 
can't fathom dealing with a slumping, 
cranky, PM Sing Barry Bonds. Nash is 
probably one of the nicer guys in the 
NBA, but what he said hurt and it's 
distressing that he didn't have a little 
sense of compassion to make an aspir-
ing journalist's day. 

Perhaps the best lesson to learn 

pied and bothered 
me greatly. I thought that our exchange 
- more so his telling me off - might 
have hung over his head or that 1 had 
somehow jinxed his performance by 
interrupting his pregame solitude, but 
it was foolish to think that at aU. Just 
yards away by the SIlnS' bench, Nash 
was sprawled out without a care in the 
world. absorbed in the realization of 
his own greatness. 

After just 27 minute of playing 
time, Nash posted 10 points and 11 
assists, shooting a cool 50 percent in 
field goal attempts and an MVP-wor-
thy performance of two-of-three from 
three-point range - all outstanding 
preseason numbers. In fact, he played 
so well that it made me wonder if he 
should start telling off more rcport -
ers to get into his rhythm. Whatever 
the case, Nash is still a phenomenal 
player, but he now has one fewer fan 
to admire his increasingly bigheaded 
character. 

THE UCSG GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2006 

Tritons Post Perfect Record in October 
â¢ VOLLEYBALL from page 16 
never relinquished the lead. The 
advantage was stretched to 16-10 
on back-to-back aces by Halvorsen . 
The advantage reached up to 10 
before junior opposite Amber Ries 
put away the 30-21 game-winning 
kill. 

The Tritons reached top form 
in game two a.s they opened up a 
qUick 14-6 lead on back-toÂ·back 
aces by senior outside hitter Nicole 
Courtney, who also recorded 12 
digs and 12 kills on the night. 
UCSD recorded the final six of its 
team blocks in this game_ 

Junior outside hitter Rebecca 
Bailey played a pivotal role in the 
final five points as she recorded 
two blocks and the two kills that 
finished the Sea Otters off in game 
two, 30-17. 

Cal State Monterey Bay didn't 
just roll over as it battled UCSD 
in game three. The score remained 
tight with the Otters taking an 18-
14 lead, forcing Black to use his 
final timeou t. 

"So much of il comes down to 
our own ex:ecution," Black said. " It 
was really about getting our focus 
back and we let them off the hook. 
[ told them to get back on our 
game: 

Kills by Bailey and Schmidt out 
of the timeout brought UCSD with -
in two points. Schmidt then served 
up three points, giving the Tritons 
the 20-19 advantage. 

Cal State Monterey Bay then 
pulled within two at 25-23, but 
UCSD's hitting power was just too 
strong as the Tritons recorded four 
straight kills to take command 
at 29-23. Senior middle blocker 
Brianna Koche finished off the 
seniors' final home game with one 
of her 14 kills to win the third 
game, 30-24. 

Se.nior setter Kristin Halvorsen 
and senior defensive specialist 

Lauren Chiodini also played domi-
nant roles in the game and contrib-
uted with 48 assists and seven digs, 
respectively. 

UCSD showed no signs of 
homesickness, downing Cal State 
Dominguez Hill's 30- 14, 30-20, 30-
22 on Oct. 25. 

In game one, the Tritons exploded 
to an 11 -5 advantage before pushing 
it to 19-8 on a block by Koche and 
Ries. The team opened up strong 
and then cruised to the 30-14 win. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills kept 
game two a little closer at the mid-
way point, trailing UCSD 15-11. But 
it was all Tritons from that point 
on. 

The team used kills by Courtney, 
Koche and Bailey to go on a 6-0 run, 
making the score 25-16. Kills by Ries 
and Bailey fInished off the Toros in 
game two, 30-20. 

UCSD scored nine of the first 

12 points, taking a 9-3 advantage. 
The lead stretched to 10 points, 23 -
13, on back-to-back kills by Bailey. 
The Tritons finished the sweep on 
a four-poinl run, capped off by 
sophomore outside hitter Casey 
Wilson's kill. 

The team finishes the regular sea-
son at Humboldt State on Nov. 3 and 
at Sonoma State on Nov. 4. 

The Tritons are also eyeing the 
NCAA Division II Pacific regional 
tournament on Nov. 9-12. 

Black noted that the team's 
preparation for the postseason will 
begin much earlier in the week off 
the court. 

"Honestly, the key [to these last 
games) is how well we take care 
of ourselves this Monday through 
Wednesday," Black said. "We have 
to eat and sleep right because if we 
feel like crap then we won't per-
form well." 

JASON CAMPA/GUARDIIIN 
Senior outside hitter Nicole Courtney added 121cilis and 12 digs in the win over the Otters,

season, assisted by junior mid fielder 
Lauren Segars. 

The ball was crossed from the 
left side into a cluster of Tritons 
in the goal box, eventually getting 
forced in by Cochran_ 

The third goal came in with 
17 minutes left by junior forward 
Kathy Sepulveda, who had been 
sweeping up the sidelines from the 
beginning. 

Sepulveda charged any ball or 
person in sight along the right and 
left sides of the field and it finally 
paid off. 

Sepulveda first stole the ball 
from her Chico State opponent and 
dribbled upfield on the outer right 
edge of the field to put a bold shot 
through from 12 yards out, which 
came to rest in the far left corner 
of the net. 

While the Tritons attacked the 
Wildcats with a force that never 
dwindled - outshooting their 
opponents 20Â·2 - McGovern was 
left trekking the goal box with a 

seemi~gly bored but proud com-
posure. 

"[ . can never complain about 
being bored because that just means 
that the defense was doing an excel-
lent job," McGovern said about the 
shutout. 

" nice to be able to 
sa now that we beat 

every team in our 
league." 

- Jessica McGovern 
Sophomore Goalkeeper 

The fmal blow came in the 87th 
minute as sophomore forward 
Natasha Belak-Berger, who substi -
tuted numerous times for Sepulveda, 
hit a right-side ball which streamed 
almost too easily into the left corner 
of the goal for a 4-0 finish. 

The Wildcats. who did a lot more 
watching than playing throughout 
the match, ended with their heads 
down as junior midfielder Ali Lai 

deflected a Chico State penalty kick 
with her head in the last seconds of 
the game. 

The angry Wildcat goalkeeper 
kicked the ball over the Triton net 
while the UCSD players ran through 
the human tunnel formed by the 
arms of proud family and fans before 
gathering centerfield to take their 
CCAA championship photo and 
receive their trophy_ 

"We are so thrilled about the 
win; Lai said_ "All the support from 
the crowd made it even more per-
sonal for us.-

The Tritons were met with an 
even larger home crowd in their pre-
vious match against Humbolt State 
on Oct. 27 when Dickey scored the 
only goal on a header 17 minutes 
into the first half, thanks to a solid 
corner ' kick by junior midfielder 
Caitlyn Ryan for the I -0 game win, 
which led to the Chico State slaugh-
ter two days later. 

The league champions now wait 
in anticipation to see if they will 
secure the privilege of hosting next 
week's NCAA Far West regional 
tournament, which will feature the 
top four teams in the region . The 
announcement will be made by 2 
p.m. on Oct. 30. 

UCSD Rages Back After First WWPA Los~ 
~ SHOOTOUT, from page 16 
mark. but it didn't take long for UC 
Davis to recapture its two-point lead 
and call on the help of some of its 
key players. 

The Aggies extended their lead 
with a goal in the third quarter, but 
the Tritons finally awoke. Junior 
utility A.f. Kotanjian, Casellini and 
senior two-meter offense Ty Lackey 
each scored a goal to tie the game 
at 4-4. 

At the 4:30 mark in the fourth 
quarter. Lackey scored again to give 
UCSD its first lead of the game. 
However, after UC Davis fought 
back and tied the game, Aggie 

I senior defense David Welch got the 
game-winning goal with 1:02 left 
in the match to lift the Aggies 6-5 
over the Tritons. With the win, the 
Aggies improved their record to 
11-10. 

According to Randall, the Tritons 
had no excuses for the mediocre 
outing against Davis, except that it 
was simply a bad and poorly played 
game. 

"We had an off game," Randall 
said. "We couldn't produce any 
offense whatsoever." 

The Tritons made up for their 
blow to their confidence by coming 
out strong the following morning 
to reestablish themselves as the top 
team in the WWPA. 

Â·They came out the next mom-

ing to face the No. 17 Air Force 
Academy, hoping to . make amends 
for their disappointing loss to UC 
Davis the night before. 

It didn't take UCSD long to score, 
as the team netted four goals before 
the Falcons could answer midway 
into the second quarter. 

After two more goals for the 
Tritons, the Air Force Academy 

were kind of flat, 
e were not making 

sharp plays and [we) 
looked tired" 

- Jeremy Randall, 
Senior Goalkeeper 

tried to close the lead, but could 
only manage one more goal to make 
it 6-3 in favor of UCSD. 

The Tritons refused to ease up 
as they outscored the Falcons 6-1 in 
the fourth to cruise to a convincing 
12-4 win. 

UCSD then faced No. 16 Santa 
Clara University in the next match. 
The offense delivered once again, 
as the Tritons defeated the Broncos, 
12-7. 

After lOSing their onJy WWPA 
match ofthe season to UC Davis, the 
Tritons bounced back emphatically 
to improve their conference record 
to 12-1 and 21-5 overall. 

According to Randall. the shock-
ing loss to Davis awoke the Tritons 
and reminded the team that wins 
are not freely given but must be 
earned with effon. 

"I think we're back on track," 
he said. 

Having played so well through 
26 games, UCSD is excited about 
the possibilities in thf postseason. 
but is mindful of the remaining 
match on its regular season calen-
dar . . 

"[UC Irvine) is in the back of our 
minds, but the biggest focus is the 
conference championship," Randall 
said. 

The Tritons return home on Nov. 
8 for Senior Night to face No.1 I UC 
Irvine in their fmal regular season 
game. 

After the senior se nd off, the 
Tritons will have over a week of rest 
before the WWPA tournament, but 
they certainly won't be idJe in their 
time off. 

The team hopes to stay on top 
of the conference and make some 
noise in the WWPA champion -
ships after falling last year to Loyola 
Marymount University in the final 
two minutes of the title match.

NBA's MVP 
Stonewalls 
Aspiring 

Journalist 
Before a surprisingly hard-fought preseason game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the 
Phoenix Suns on Oct. 22 at the San 
Diego ports Arena, two-time MVP 
"teve Nash told this lowly peasant to 
get off of his throne. 

As I nervouslv waited outside the 
uns' locker room' fo r the team to con-

e ude Its preganle meeting, It occurred 

UnO naiable 

to me that I would soon be in the midst 
of some of the NBA's premier players 
Wlth the opportunity to ask one of 
them a question before they hit the 
court. Suddenly, a rousing shout came 
from inside the cold hole in the wall 
that was Phoenix's locker room, and 
the two-time Pacific Division champi-
ons emerged from the chamber. 

Most of the players kept to them-
elves, stretching or bouncing to ease 

the tension and get loose. Some unfa-
miliar players chatted with each other, 
but the stars appeared relaxed and , 
quiet. Unlike the rest of the squad, 
Nash was talking to himself in a high-
pitched voice, not really saying anything 
but scattering numerous f-bombs, as if 
to cleanse his system. After about 30 
seconds of this ritual, I decided to 
approach the star point guard. 

"Steve, can I get a word?" 
He looked at me kindly enough, as 

if he was willing to give me.a minute. 
I approached him, eager to ask some 
throwaway question about what the 
streaking Suns hoped to take away 
from the matchup against the injury-
ridden Lakers. 

As I approached, his easygoing 
expression remained unchanged, and 
I thought that he would be receptive of 
my question. 

"Steve, the Lakers have been - " 
'rue you kidding me?" he said cold-

ly. "I'm not doing an intervieW.' 
"Not now?" 
"No, not now. Tuck!" Nash said, 

calling for one of the assistant coaches. 
"Tuck, can't you fucking do anything 
for me? Jesus Christ!" 

"Tuck" looked at Nash with a look 
that almost said, "What do you want 
me to do, shoot him?" 

No guns were necessary, and as I 
left, Nash aid a few thing about me 
that were largely inaudible except fo r a 
few "fucks" here and there. I'm not sure 
what he said, but some of the players-
mostly the guys who were fig\1ting to 
make the team and would have laughed 
at anything Nash saId - looked at me 
and laughed, and how many ~Ix -foot, 
five-lOch monsters laughmg at you 
does It take to get embarrassed? 

I hobbled away, red-cheeked and 
wounded. Nash was a man [ had come 
to respect as a player, but I got to ee the 
upstanding CanadIan In an un!avor-
ably arrogant light. . 

I probably broke every unwritten 
journalism rule by waiting outside the 
locker room before the game. I was 
the only journalist there, and that was 
probably a huge hint that I shouldn't 
have been there. Players need to get 
focused and ready for the game, and 

- they don't have any de ire to answer 
orne pimply kid's stupid question. The 

microphones should be shoved into the 
players' faces after the game, when the 
blood has been spilled and the battle 
has been fought. 

Nonetheless, Nash could have been

Tritons Capture Conference Title 
By Nicky Buchanan 

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 

"Hey Chico ... I have a white flag 
ready for you when you want it!" 
These were the words shouted by 
one of the many rowdy Triton fans 
who cheered on their home team in 
RlMAC Soccer Stadium on Oct. 29 
as it crushed Chico State 4-0 for the 
2006 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association championship title for 
the sixth time in seven years. 

While dreams of a national 
championship entry propelled the 
No. 3 UCSD squad, sweet revenge 
couldn't help but take its toll on the 
hearts of the Tritons, whose only 
loss of the season was to Chico State 
on Sept. 17 with a score of 0-1 . 

"This meant a lot to us as far as 
pride goes and we wanted to prove 
that the last game was a fluke:' 
sophomore goalie Jessica McGovern 
said. "It's nice to be able to say 

. now that we beat every team in our 
league." 

The Wildcats seemed to take a 
submissive stance from the begin-
ning, allowing the Tritons the first 
touch on the ball for the majority of 
the game. 

The first half looked much like 
a game of cat and mouse as the 
Tritons maintained ball possession, 
forcing the Wildcats to scurry into 
defensive mode. 

However, the Chico State passes 
were not enough to overcome the 
Triton pressure, and a shot by senior 
mid fie lder Megan Dickey ftnally 
raided the Wildcat net with 30 sec-
onds left in the first half. 

Sophomore midfielder Kelly 
Mayo assisted the shot, slinking a 
pass from 15 yards out to Dickey, 
who pounded the ball through 
the crowded defense and past the 
Wildcat keeper to sink the ball 
straight in the center of the goal.

The goal sent the crowd into a 
frenzy, setting a tone for the second 
half that would not be disrupted as 
the Tritons earned three more goals 
for the largest scoring margin in a 
CCAA championship tournament 
final match since 2003 when UCSD

Men's Water 
Polo Drops 
Road Match 

to Aggies 
By Paul Choi 

EN IOR STAFF WRITER 

Appeart ng a bit tired and even 
lacking some focus, the UCSD 
men's water polo team stumbled 
against UC DaVIS before beating 
two Western Water Polo AssocIation 
teams at UC DaVIS' annual Aggie 
Shootout. , 

After a long bus ride to Davis, 
Calif., the No. 5 Tritons faced the 
No. 13 Aggies at the Schaal Aquattcs 
Center on Oct. 27. 

It was clear that UCSD was not 
on top of its game as a surging 
UC Davis team scored twice and 
held the Tritons scoreless in the 
first quarter. UCSD continued to 
struggle offensively in the second 
half, but the defense kept the game 
within reach. 

Â«We were kind of flat:' senior 
goalkeeper Jeremy Randall said. 
Â«We were not making sharp plays, 
and [weI looked tired." 

Senior utility Jesse Casellini 
finally got UCSD on the board with 
a goal at the 3 minute, 28 second

Tritons Barrel Toward Playoffs 
By Matt Croskey 

STAFF WRITER 

Ever since the UCSD women's 
volleyball team fell twice earlier in 
the season, the Tritons have made 
a torrid run, winning 12 straight 
matches, their last "two against Cal 
tate Monterey Bay and Cal State 

Dominguez Hills. 
The team improved its over-

all record to 21 -2 and its confer-
ence record to 16-2, only one game 
behind Cal State San Bernardino 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. 

The Triton seniors showed 
why they will be missed' in the last 
home game on Oct. 28, as they sent 
Cal State Monterey Bay packing, 
sweeping the Sea Otters 30-21, 30-
17, 30-24. 

"The seniors have been the 
backbone to this team and we're 
going to miss them a lot," head 
coach Tom Black said. Â· One of the 
strengths of this team all year has 
been our depth. There's a lot of tal -
ent waiting on the bench." 

UCSD jumped out 7-3 after a
