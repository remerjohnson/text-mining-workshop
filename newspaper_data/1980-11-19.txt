Discs 
returned 
in bag 

The two typesetting discs 
stolen Saturday night from 
the student center were 
returhed yesterday after-
noon. 

The discs, worth about 
$150 -each, held up MW 
indicator production, but the 
paper, looking a little 
Jumbled, came out anyway. 

They were returned in a 
brown Safeway bag to the 
indicator office, but Woodard 
says, "They (the people who 
returned the discs) must 
have done it under the cloak 
in invisibility, because no one 
saw them. " 

Three indicator pages 
stolen at the same time are 
still missing. 

Regents sued 
for nuke 
weapons lab 

OAKLAND (AP) - An 
anti-nuclear group yesterday 
sued the Bc"lrd of Regents for 

. alleged conflict of interest in 
the management of two 
nuclear-weapons labora-
torie . 

In a suit filed in Alameda 
County Superior Court, the 
Nuclear Weapon Labs 
Conversion Project also 
named seven individual 
regents and four members of 
the UC's President.'s 
Scientific Advisory Commit· 
tee. 

The project threatened a 
lawsuit in September, 
charging the regents with 
conflict of interest as they 
voted to renew contract 
negotiations with the 
Department of Energy, for 
which the university runs 
the Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratory and the Los 
Alamos, NM laboratory. 

The suit accuses the 
defendants of improperly 
influencing other r~ents . It 
asks the court tonulhfy three

regents and to disqualify the 
defendants from further

Weinglass speaks 
on NASSCO 3 

Likens case to Abscam 
BY PETER MORTENSEN 

Newa Editor 
Noted progressive Leonard 

Weinglass told a group of 
UCSt) students last night 
that "the case against 
NASSCO's Three is the first 
extension of Abscam into the 
area of persons moving for 
change and for betterment in 
this country." 

Weinglass, who has 
represented such defendents 
as the Chicago Seven, Angela 
Davis and Russell Means 
(Wounded Knee), outlined his 
belief that "government-
conceived crimes" are 
becoming dangerous tools 
used to undermine "its 
enemie ." 

Weingla was on hand 
with his clients - Rodney 
John on, Clyde Leo and 
David Boyd - at the 
invitation of UCSD's Third 
World Studie Program . 
Weingla spoke on "Civil 
Rights in the 80s - An 
Attack Against One Is an 
Attack Against All." 

The lawyer for the so-
called NASSCO Three said 

that his clients were'vicitms 
of "classic conspiracy" and 
that the government agent 
was "planted" in the-group of 
striking NASSCO workers 
with the intention of 
disabling the union mechan-
ism. 

NASSCO workers are on 
strike because of what they 
term intolerable working 
conditions on the job. 
NASSCO is one of the west's 
largest shipbuilding corpora-
tions and has a number of 
defense-related contracts 
with the US government. 

Weinglas explained that 
the parallel with A bscam was 
close. In Abscam, govern-
ment officials , mostly 
congressmen, were lured into 
an FBI fabricated crime, led 
to accept money and then 
prosecuted for their action. 

But in the NASSCO case, 
he said that the government 
agent wa di uaded from 
carrying through with his 
prefabricated crime -
planting a bomb in the 

Berkeley grad Stelck gets

Stelck was selected over 
two other finalists for the 
position, UCLA's Patricia

director of the Associated 
Students Internship Office 
here. 

''I'm really happy to be

Stelck said yesterday of her 

appointment. 
A one of three co-directors 

of the influential Student 
Lobby, Stelck will survey 
legislation in the State 
Capitol that affects the needs 
and welfare of students. The 
co-directors also lobby 
members of the UC Board of 
Regents on behalf of all UC 
students. 

Among Stelck's goals as 
she begins her two year co-
director term in January is to 
push for "a renewed 
commitment by the univer-
sity to being an institute of 
higher education. 

"I'm very supportive of 
inter-disciplinary studies," 
she said, adding .that she 
would like to "see the 

university concentrate more 
effort in that area (inter-

Regents discuss energy labs 
BY JACK DANIELS 

UC-operated Department 
of Energy Laboratories, one 
of which is heavily involved 
with weapons research and 
development, will be among 
issues discussed today 
through Friday at the UC 
Board of Regents meetings 
in San Francisco. 

A motion made by 
Governor Edmund G. 
Brown, Jr. at the Regents' 
September meeting promp· 
ted an investigation of the 
management and operation 
of the laboratories,including 
the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laborator and 
the Los Alamos National 
Scientjfic Laboratory, a 
facility known for its 

strength in weapons 
development and research. 

Brown at that time 
designated a committee to 
examine the facilities and 
"expeditiously develop both 
a general plan and specific 
recommendations for 
improved management of 
the laboratories." That 
committee is expected to 
report its views and 
findings at today 's Regents' 
meeting. 

In October, this commit· 
tee held a 'ession at which 
UC Pre ident David Saxon 
pre ented an outline 
propo ing a plan for 
impro ed Univer ity 
management of the two 
facilities . 

Operation of the law-
rence and Los Alamos 
laboratories already places 
much responsibility upon 
the Regents and Saxon, who 
must ensure that the 
quality of the work done at 
the laboratorie meets the 
highest technical and 
cientific tandard . Under 

Saxon's plan, the Univer· 
ity would become even 

more involved with the 
management and operation 
of both labora ries.

---~ ... -------------------------------------------------------
One way to stamp out prostrate cancer in US. • • 

Editor: 
It has come to my attention 

that a recent GJUJrdian letter 
entitled "Unite for Orgasm" 
(The Daily GlUlrdian, Nov. 
12) has caused a great deal of 
controversy among the 
UCSD student body. 

1bere seem to be three 
factions involved in this 
disagreement. The first, led 
by the author of the original 
article, is represented by the 
<!.r.sanization MENTOO (Males's Especial Need To 
Orpsrn Opulently) and its 
folTowers. These people 
believe' that men, as well as 
women, have the right to 
multiple orgasms . The 
second ' group seems to be 
against multiple orgasm in 
general, thinking itto be anti-
American or unbiblical. The 
last group is represented by 
the women of WAPE (Women 
Against Premature Ejacula-
tion). (The three rebutting 
letters appeared in The Daily 
GlUlrditl" on Nov. 17.) 

a violation of the basic rights 
of Americans to free speech 
and press, as the articles 
cited were not pornographic. 

I need not reply to the first 
letter other than to say that 

-men have their rights too, 
and men will get the legal 
right to multiple orgasm if 
the ERA passes. To the 
second group I would like to 
present two points. First, if 
multiple orgasms were 
universally shared by men 
and women, it could only 
increase the number of 
births, thereby increasing 
the number of American 
children that can grow up to 
live the American Dream. 
Secondly, did not God say, 
"Be fruitful and multifly?" 
Mr. Bliss knows as wei as I 
that nowhere in the Bible are 
multiple orgasms or those 
who practice them (male or 
female) condemned. Sex is a 
beautiful thing, whether or 
not a Supreme Being created 
us. The last group is 
comprised mainly of women 
who are either insensitive or 
frigid, but they need love, too. 

came across a small article, 
hidden on page 11, that made 
me worry even more. The 
article stated that a lack of 
sex had been linked to 
prostrate cancer in males. It 
was then that [ realized the 
increasingly serious portents 
of this problem. American 
males ar.e dying off at the rate 
of 22,000 a year due to 
prostrate cancer. 

I orought up this subject 
while conversing with my 
Australian friend and 

colleague, Brock Townsen. 
Lo and behold, he presented a 
nearly perfect solution that 
should solve the problem for 
all but the religiously 
inclined readers of this paper. 
The solution is simple, yet 
functional : therapeutic 
orgies. I realized that this 
would appease the members 
of MENTOO, as they would 
be able to orgasm their hearts 
out. Also the women of 
WAPE, who take a while to 
warm up, must merely 

switch to a fresh partner if 
the one they are with should 
ejaculate prematurely. In 
this way they, too, can 
orgasm as much as they like. 
At the same time, thousands 
of unnecessary cancer deaths 
each year could be easily and 
painlessly prevented. And 
there will always be more 
children to enjoy the 
American way of Life, and to 
live to fulfill the American 
Dream. 

Before I address these 
various views I would like to 
point out to all those ' 
rebuUalists who criticize the 
Gurd",,, staff that to censor 
or refuse to print articles on 
the basis of content would be 

Women's country? 

I realized after reading the 
three rebuttals that a serious 
problem was facing us. As I 
read through the paper, I 

EDDIE STAIRCASE 

Feminizing Bay Area government without feminists 
into the area, the shape, look and feel 
of the.county is changing at a dizzying 
pace. Before 1985, San Jose will ~ 

BY AIllSON ENGEL 
SAN JOSE, Ca. - If there is a 

grain of truth to the notion that the 
San Francisco Bay Area is sometimes 
a bellwether of change for the nation 
as a whole, then the country should 
begin preparing for the coming 
"feminization" of local government. 
But not necessarily by feminists. 

On Nov. 4, women gained first·ever 
major.ities of the San Jose City 
Council, the Santa Clara County 
Board of Supervisors and the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors. This 
gives them political domination of the 
state's third- and fourth-Iar,gest cities 
and of one of the nation s fastest-
growin~ counties, which already has a 
populatIon larger than Rhode Island, 
Maine and several other states. 

While the number of successful 
women candidates this time around is 
startlillf{, women here have been hold-
ing poSItions of power since the mid-
70s. San Jose has been headed by a 
woman mayor for several years, as 
has San Francisco. So many women in 
the Santa Clara County just south of 
San Francisco hold elected and 
appointed political offices, that 
even before this latest election the 
county had been dubbed' 'tpe feminist 
capital of the world." 
. But it is noteworthy that during 
their campaigns the female 
candidates barely mentioned 
traditional feminist issues such as the 
'Equal Rights Amendment, affirma-
tive action and abortion rights. In San 
Jose p!1rticualrly, female office-
seekers went out of their-way to shun 
the feminist label. 

"I'm not a feminist, I'm a woman," 
newly·elected councilwoman Patricia 
Sausedo has said. 

Councilwoman Nancy Ianni s'aid 
that while she feels women's issues 
are important P think they touch 
everyone's lives '), they had no place 
in her campaign. 

"The City of San Jose doesn't deal · 
with abortion," she said. "I keep my 
opinions on that to myself." Local 
"bread and butter" issues were what 
mattered in the council campaigns, 
she said. "When you're interested in a 
sewer treatment plant, there isn't a 
feminist point of view about it." . 

Allison E"¥tl wrote this for the Pacific 
News Se"Jtce. 

Another new council member, Lu 
Ryden, not only downplayed women's 
issues, she openly repudiated them. 
She said she does not identify with 
feminist issues because they 
represent an intrusion into people's 
lives by the federal government. 

"I won without the ERA on San Jose 
stands and on San Jose issues," she 
said. "When I walked the precincts, 

the main thing everyone hit on was 
crime. It's the number one issue." 

Another of the newly·elected 
councilwomen, Blanca Alvarado, the 
city's first-ever Chicana on the board, 
echoed the familiar complaint that the 
feminist movement has little to do 
with people of color and the poor. ''The 
women's movement is centered 
around Caucasian women,". she said. 
Although some of her East-side voters 
see the ERA as symbolically 
important, she said people of color 
focus on economic Quality issues, such 
as education and fair housing. 

Clearly, the San Jose women who 
found success did not look to national 
women's groups to define the issues. 
They won by focusing on the issues 
men have been winning elections with 
for years: how to relieve traffic 
congestion, how city services can be 
improved, how the city should take 
shape. whether or not female 
candidates were annointed by 
women's organizations or even 
whether they supported women's 
issues proved irrelevant. 

For example, the San Jose chapter of 

the Naitonal Organization for women 
(NOW) endorsed only one of the nine 
women who made it to the fall ballot 
for city councilor county supervisor. 
NOW spokeswoman Elise Moss said 
the reason. was that the others "were 
not feminists" because they did not 
give strong public support to feminist 
issues like ERA, abortion rights and 
day care. "I think the election shows 
that feminism is dying out," she said . 

' larger than San Francisco. As this 
election dominated by political 
newcomers showed, it was a city and 
county up for grabs. 

The women who entered the fray , 
for the most part, started at the 
bottom rung of political action: 
organinzing the coffees, doing 
publicity for other candidates, 
volunteering for neighborhood 
organizations to improve libraries and 
schools. They were the nitty-gritty 
workers "who helped elect a lot of men 
in the past," said Blanca Alvarado. 

But lola Williams, who became San 
Jose's first black council member 
when she was appointed two years 
ago, said she thought the San Jose-
area victories "were an indication 
that people were looking at the Qual i ty 
of the candidates and their issues and 
not whether they wore skirts or 
trousers. That's all women have been 
asking ior all these years." 

San J~e Mayor Janet Gray Hayes, 
who has been elected twice without 
making much mention of women's 
issues, said "many San Jose 
constituents would be turned off by 
(my) running on feminist issues .... 

Without focusing on women's 
issues, "we, in our own way here, 
have been able to get in decision-
making positions. As my mother used 
to tell me, 'there's more than one way 
to skin a cat' ," said Mayor Hayes. 

She said no national women's 
groups have yet asked her for advice 
on how to repeat the spectacular 
success of women here. If they did, she . 
would suggest they reassess their own 
goals and methOds. saying women's 
interest groups at times exhibit 
"tunnel vision" by expending too 
'much effort on fundraising for 
narrowly-drawn goals. "You've got 
ask - are you interested in getting 
women into leadership positions or 
are you so single purpose on the ERA 
and the abortion issue that it 
overshadows all else?" 

The gains women have made in San 
Jose came in the city's first district -
as opposed to citywide - elections. 
And they came at a time when San 
Jose and Santa Clara County are 
enjoying explosive, boomtown growth 
that graphically contradicts their 
sleepy. backwater agricultural 
reputations of years back. New 
electronics companies are starting up, 
plitting and re-forming weekly in ~he 

county's Silicon Valley. And WIth 
thousands of Chicanos, Asians and 
other Third World citizens pouring 

Some say the strong interest of 
women in the. San Jose government is 
H,ed to the low pay traditionally meted 
out for council work - $400 a month. 
But poor compensation didn 't 
discourage men from running. More 
men than women actually tried for the 
council posts, but after the primary, 
each district race pitted a woman 
against a man. Ultimately, women 
were victorious in five races, making a . 
total of six on the boartl 

After the election, the female 
winners said they were uncomfor-
table with all the attention focused on 
their gender, and were quick to say 
they would not be voting as a block. 
"We're as different as men would be," 
said council member Ianni . But their 
victories stiII are symbolic of true 
progress by women who hav~ gailled 
the means not only to shape tlleirown 
futures but the destiny of one of the 
fastest-growing areas in the country. 

The victories also are symbolic 
because they so clearly refute the 
prevailing dichotomy between 
independent. front·line feminists and 
male-dominated, passive, stay-at-
home women. the ·.vorld according to 
Santa Clara County (and 1JI0St likely, 
the rest of the country) doesn't divide 
into those two camps. 

In San Francisco, supervisors were 
elected ritywide, but most of the 
victors won on public recognition 
gained during previous terms when 
they were elected by district. AI-

thou~h several. of the six women s~­
pervlsors identify themselves as femI-
nists, women's issues were not at all 
central to the campaign. The housing 
shortage, VIolence on municipal 
buses, the city's fiscal health and the

Professor Tolbert To Be 
Reviewed for Tenure 

Professex Emory Tolbert, of the 
History Department and Third 
World Studies Program IS being 
revi ewed for te n u re i n 
December. Dr. Tolbert teaches 
Third World Studies 7A, Afr<> 
American History 159A-B and a 
colliquium course on Marcus 
Garvey. 

Dr. Tolbert is mcre then 
qualified for terureship. He has 
received outstanding marks in 
teaching and community service. 
Additionally, his academic 
scholarship has been positively 
acclaimed by scholars 1Nh0 have 
reviewed his book on Marcus 

Garvey. There can be no 
legitimate reason why the History 
Department would deny him 
terure. 

This is an important issue not 
only because Professcx Tolbert is 
qualified, but he is qual ified to 
teach a most relevant subject -
Black American History. The 
denial of Dr. Tolbert could very 
well mean the elimination of 
8lack-American History, a subject 
which deserves permanence at 
this university. A denial ofT olbert 
would also be a part of UCSO's 
historic and systematic expulsion 
of Black faculty from this campus. 

From 36 in 1974 to 18 in 1980! 
It is most important that 

students write/type letters in 
support of Professor Tolbert. 
They should be addressed to the 
History Department, with your ID 
number included, and sent to the 
Black Student's Union office at 
mailing code 8-023 before 
November 26. 

For all those who recognize the 
Importance of stopping this 
vicious trend and supporting Dr. 
Tolbert, there will be a Tolbert 
Committee meeting on Wed, 
No.1. 26 at 6:00 pm in the Third 
College Center for the People. 

The Story of Olga 
Once upon a time, a woman 

named Olga wert to school at 
UCSD. She was one of a group of 
students who helped to start CHE 
CAFE. Che Cafe prOlides cheap, 
healthy eats through non-
hierarchial means in a warm, 
stimulating environment. Olga 
often spoke to her fellem wcxkers 
at the Che about prOliiding 
housing in the same manner. 
'Wouldn't it be great," she asked 
them, "if we could live 
somewhere lNhich ....-e collec-
tively owned? Where everyone 
could have an equal voice in all 
decision making? Wouldn't it be 
wonderful if by emning oor 
home, maintaining it ourselves 
and WOOing together to provide 
ourselves with meals we could 
ctastically cut our costs? By living 
there together and working there 
we would feel a deep sense of 
dignity for our house, ourse~s 
and each other plus a sense of 
belonging that we don't'kncm in 
our transient, non-commitallive at 
UCSD." 

Olga became more and 'mcre 
interested in c<>op housing. She 
found out that in ~rkeley 
stuiXrn starkd housing c<>ops 
in 1933 which now heM: 
expanded to house 1300 

~. Then" found out that 
5tudents et UC Santa Cruz 
cQr1l/elttd c<>ops !!Iso. She 

visited all of them and they told 
her, " Hey, we 're in an 
organization called \lVESTCO 
(West Coast Students of 
Cooperation). Part of tne 
cooperative philosophy is to 
help other cooperatives. We'lI 
help you in whatever way we 
can. The Student Center Board at 
UCSD has put c<>ops as their first 
priexity so when Olga came to , 
them for help, they sent her to an . 
education conference in Ann 
Arbex, Michigan put on by the 
largest organization of student 
co-ops in the United States, 
NASCa ( North American 
Students of Cooperation). Having 
gremn up in Califexnia, Olga was 
overwhelmed by Ann Arbor. She 
stopped someone on the street 
and said, . What do you call this, I 
think I've seen something like this 
is a mOllie?" 'We call it autumn," 
replied the person whom Olga 
stopped. The yellem, bremn and 
orange leaves engulfing the 
sidewalks and the brisk, chilly air 
were alien to Olga 

Olga was btunate to meet 
mIIjex c<>cp leaders from the US 
and Canada . But more 

If'I1)OItant~ the RId students like 
herself from ~ University of 
Massachusetts, University of 
Toronto, Oberlin Col/ege, 
UrMrsity of Io.o.e, Unillersity of 
Mi~, lkIiversitY of Texas 

and mexe that ....-ere eager to start 
cr expand c<>cps. Olga learned 
that most schools represented at 
the conference had establ ished 
co-op houses but didn't have any 
service c<>ops such as there is at 
UCSD (Food C<>op, General 
Store, Assorted Vi nyI, Che Cafe, 
etc.) Besides meeting nevv 
people and setting up lines of 
communication, Olga attended 11 
workshop about the National 
Consumer's C<>op Bank. She 
attended workshops on student 
housing co-op memberl 
education, housing mairtenanc:e 
and membership policies. 

When Olga returned to UCSD 
she was on a c<>op high which 
she quickly passed on to her 
fellem co-opers. She set up a 
special place in theChe lounge at 
the Che Cafe with all the resource 
material she received in 
Michigan. They went to work, 
arranging meetings w ith the 
administration to discuss c<>op 
housing and started to research

AnI .... 1 Bowl 

This Sunday come 2 
o'clock or so, a few of the boys 
are getting together down at 
the field. You know, the one 
near the Muir tennis courts. 
Yep, they'll be gettin' 
together for a li'l or ball 
game. Ya ... and they'll be 
gettin' down too. You 
know ... thumpin' a little here, 
poundin' a little there, and 
throwin' that crazy shaped 
ball all over the place. 
Afterwards, the ooys will sit 
around and nurse their 
wounds, drink a few 
Budweisers and then head 
for home. And when it's all 
over, we'll have put the 
Animal Bowl to rest for 
another year. 

Aah ... the Animal Bowl. 
Now there's a real classy lady 
for you . She's right up there 
with all of those great UCSD 
traditions. You know ... the 
Watermelon Drop and all of 
those kinds of things. And 
believe it or not Animal Bowl 
Sunday is rolling into its 5th 
year. Animal Bowl V, 
already? Naw .. couldn't be. 
Why it seems just like 
yesterday that those surfer 
kids from the beach were 
playing those brothers from 
the city in the greatest 
football game ever played at 
UCSD. You remember that 
one don:t you. Raw Meat and 
Chocolate City . Now that 
was an exciting football 
game. 27-26 was the score. 
Whew!...What a finish! ... and 

it was in overtime to OOot! 
Can't even remember who 
won ... but who cares .. . the 
game itself was really all that 
counted ... and now this 
Sunday we've got another 
one comin' up. 

And guess who's still 
there. Yep ... those crusty 01' 
guys from Unbeat Meat. 
Ya ... Mark and Dave and 
Matt ... they're still around. 
You can't give these guys 
enough football. But it could 
be interesting this year. 
They've got another new 
quarterback. Jeff Cleveland's 
his name and he's starting to 
remind people a lot of some of 
Meat's better QBs from years 
past...you know the infamous 
Rich Foulks? and Bob Mulick 
or was that Bert Jones and 
Brian Sipe? 

At any rate, the Meat is on 
a roll again. Afterlosing their 
first game ever at the 
beginning of the season to 
Cut 'N Run, Lochtefeld, 
Wiesehahn and Co. have 
reoounded to get the Meat 
Machine back in high gear. 
The defense is superb .. . they 
shut out both Re~urn of The 
and Rocky Mtn Oysters in 
the play·offs, 4l-0 and 12-
O ... and the offense ... well that 
speaks for itself. These guys 
are masters of the long OOmb. 
A conservative play to them 
is a man·in·motion, triple , 
reverse, double·pass into the 
end zone. Ya ... the Meat is 
still there. You can bet thev'lI 
be showing up on Sunday. 

Their opponent? Who 

knows. Friday afternoon, Cut 
'N Run and the York Hunt 
Club wi1l square off to see 
who gets to go Animal 
Bowling. That should be a 
good one too. Last time they 
met...it was more like fast· 
break basketball. Something 
like 38·28. You know .. . plenty 
of "O" .. . but defense? You've 
got to be kidding. Lloyd Free 
has played much better. 

The Cut 'N Runners 
should be the favorites. 
They've won every time 
they've played this year .. . and 
their t~lent is for real. Mike 
Wagner is the quarterback. 
He's a cross between Marc 
Wilson and Gifford Nielsen 
Joel Erickson is the number 
one receiver and Rich Roux 
can burn it to the outside. 
Dave Frankville, the captain, 
ddes a masterful job of 
getting them all to show up 
on time. Most of Cut 'N Run 
are trying to be decent Med 
School stu dents when 
Frankville isn't calling one of 
his infamous practices. 

The other team? You know 
'em. The Hunt Club. Or is it 
Sandbag City? Last year 
these guys blew through 
Men's AA like a house afire. 
This year is a bit different. 
They brought their offense 
along with them ... but they're 
defen e ..... anyOOdy seen it? 

Unless McEldowney and 
Northcraft come up with 
some game·winning beau-
tie , the Hunt Clubbers may 
be in for a long afternoon.

Just because this game is

mean that these fellows play 
like a bunch of stiffs. No sir. 
Not this year anyway. 

This one could be a real 
barn-burner. The kind the 
Raiders and 49ers used to 
play when they first started 
out. This one has a real cozy 
flavor to it. Both teams come 
from Floor·Q at the Muir 
Apartments. Not only is this 
game being played for t he All·

CIIma Bowl 
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let 's 

see now. Here we are for the 
fifth annual Climax Bowl, 
representing the two best 
coed football team at UCSD. 
In one corner, we have the 
Anisotropic Sh ie I d ers . 
Ya ... we've seen them before. 
They've played in this game 
since 1892. So what else is 
new. And in the other corner, 
we have One In The Hand or 
is it More Better Hands, or 
just Better Hands, or is it the 
Goodhands People? Wrong! 
On all four counts . The 
people with the hand fixation 
aren't anywhere to be seen. 
Can you believe it? After 
participat ing in every C lima'x 
Bowl ever held, Frank 
Vernon and his ever-
changing group of talented 
female receivers finally met 
their match. As defending 
champions, everyone had 
just about conceded One In 
The Hand their usual spot in 
the play-off finals . But 
somebody forgot to tell those 
upstart youngsters from Hot 
Fudge. And 10 and be-
hold ... we have a new 
representative in the most 
fun bowl game of all. 
Organizers of the Climax 
Bowl were delerious . 
Shielder-Hands champion-
ship games were getting as 
commonplace as seeing USC 
and Michigan in the Rose 
Bowl every year. 

Now they've got a game 
that everyone can sink their 
teeth into. Hot Fudge ... who 
would've guessed it? Not that 
they weren't good, mind you. 
After all they did go all the 
way last year in Coed A and 
topped of a fi ne season by 
inaugerating the Soul Bowl 
with a 12·0 triumph over the 
Ebony Stars. But, no one 
really thought that they 
could make the big tep up to 
M in one quick year. As 
usual everyone was wrong. 
The Fudgies pulled the 
stunning upset of the year as 
they nipped One In The Hand 
13-12 last weekend. QB 
Chuck Bos ett ha his u ual 
assortment of s peedy 
receivers in Alma Edwards 
and Damita Davis. and with 
Janis Carter playing her 
stick-on·you-like·glue de · 
fense, Hot Fudge may give 
the Shielders a run for their 
money. 

Of course. wedon'twant to 
get carried away. After all the 
Shielders did bury the 
Fudgies earlier in the season 
27-6. And let's be honest. 
These creatures from the 
Chern Department have some 
awful nice numbers to their 
credit over the year. Like 
records of 6- 1. 8-0, 10-0-1 , 7-1, 
and 7·0 in the pa t five 
seasons. That adds up to 38· 
2-1 and any way you look at 

Thl' Daily (;uardian 

it .. .it ain't too shabby. 
The Shielder mystique is 

an enigma now. Tandem 
Quarterbacks Paul Croft and 
Carol Post have already been 
enshrined in the Intramural 
Hall of Fame, right next to 
two other great immortals, 
Myarma Hertz and Harry 
Wheels. Croft, the master 
strategist, isn't getting it 
done as easy these days. No 
longer can he throw those 
beautifully tight Billy Kilmer 
spiral s as he once did . No 
longer can he scramble 
around in the backfield ala 
Craig Morton in search of an 
open receiver. No longer can 
he steady those ever-
informative-play card in the 
huddle. But, what does work 
for him, cannot be underesti-
mated. He's still got the 01' 
ticker between his ears 
working overtime. Always 
innovating, always creating. 
Still researching that 
perfectly designed play that 
will put his 9.5 sprinter/cen-
ter in a one-on-one mismatch 
with some slow, gawky, 
freshman defensive back , 
who has never even played a 
down of footWill in his life. 

But then what else can you 
expect from a 42-year old man 
who hasn't learned yet that 
football is still a game. agame 
that is administered by 50-
year olds, played by 25-year 
olds for the sole benefit of 12-
year olds.

chicken. After all, they're 
only little guys. But that's 
the beauty of it all. Seven 
guys running around the 
yard with a hot potato for a 
football. Football? Maybe not. 
But who's going to argue 
with the resul ts. Let 's face it, 

the season·long. number one· 
rated Wha Koos have all the 
right numbers. 9 wins, 0 
losses and more touchdown 
pa es than even BYU would 
ever dream about. Last week 
in thei r semi·final tun eup 
game, Wha Koos di smantled 
the 6gers in methodical 
fa s hion 32· 14 . Nothing 
unu ual about that. Their 
ot her play-off scores \ er 31· 
8, 37· 14 , and 2 -6. During the 
"eason they once won 54-0. 
Let's put it this way. The e 
guys can play some offen e. 
They've become so good. 
they've set Hawaiian 
Football back at least 25 
years. 

But hold on .. .Iet's give the 
speed freaks from Graphite 
equal time. To tell you the 
trut h, these boys can move it 
pretty good themselves. And 
their numbers are ju t as 
solid. 9·0, play-off scores of 
33-0, 21-7, 25-0, and 26-13 and 
over some pretty fair 
competition. Let's face it. 
Teams like the MPs, The 
Express, and Red, Ruff 'N 
Sore aren't exactly the Little 
Sisters of the Poor. 

No, now that I think about 
it, the 1980 Banana Bowlju t 
might be the best gam.e of the 
bunch this time around. Of 
course, it could just as easily 

~ the worst. I mean, if you 
knew the history of these 
teams, you'd have to agree. 
These guys have been here 
before ... many times in fact. 
All of them would start for 
the Charlie Brown All-Stars. 

. Graphite really takes the 
cake though. They've been 
trying to win AA foot ball for 
the last 86 years. They get 
close but they just can't seem 
to swallow the banana. If 
they'd only realize that it's 
not that easy to get down, 
going sideways. . 

Their frustration over the 
years is so great that they 
have to change their team 
name every season. Maybe 
because they're too embar· 
rassed to say they "blew 
another one." The closest 
they came was Banana Bowl 
n when they posed as 
Linomania and got nipped at 
the wire by a strong Bofo 
team. In '78 it was Heroin , 
and last year, it was 
Methadone. The results ... al -
ways the same. No Banana. 

And now we come to 1980. 
Will they find a way?Tunein 

--~I~----------------------------------------- Their opponents, the Supporters, are merely 
awesome. Every week they 
beat up teams so badly that 
you'd think Roman Gabriel 
was the losing team's coach. 
Some of their scores are 
ridiculous . 44-0, 38-14, 46-zip. 
This is fun? 1 guess. 

When the promoters of this East a chance to view the 
year's Soul Bowl went proceedings in prime time. 
scurrying about campus Why TV? Well, you see 
looking for teams to invite to folks, this is the last football 
the second annual classic, game of Andy Berg' s 
never in their wildest dreams collegiate career. And believe 
did they expect to ~et the two ' me, there are plenty of Berg 
very best teams In Coed A supporters back in the 
Football. remote regions of New York 

After all, one upset here, City and Joisey.

sudden the dream game ofthe Bowl match-up of Berg's 
week is history. This year, Bust Up The Middle and the 
the Soul Bowl got lucky. Not Athletic Supporters is a hot

Iso got a fat TV contract. sponsors for this Sunday's 
ence, the early lOam telecast. Like Maidenform 

tartin'l time this Sunday. Bras , Referee Magazine, and 
his will give viewers in the CG Fashions of Poway. 

Why all the hub-bub? Well 
you see, Andy Berg has 
always had this dream to 
play quarterback in a major 
bowl game. After graduating 
from high school, . Berg 
searched the country looking 
for any $Chool that would 
give him an intramural 
athletic scholarship. Yep, you 
guessed it! Only good 01' 
UCSD came through . 

So here's Mr. Berg in his 
senior year and he's finally 
made it. Of course, his 
teammates had a lot to do 
with it. In fact, they had 
most ly to do with it. 

Bust Up The Middle 
features a trio of comely wide 

receivers crane, Julie, and 
Sue) who can all catch it in a 
crowd . What they are 
catching is sometimes 
debatable. Usually, it's one of 
Berg's consistently iII·timed 
missiles. By the way, Bust Up 
leads the league in great 
diving catches. They also 
have a number of great 
defensive specialists. Larry 
Vandend 80s is the one and 
only Mad Flagger. Rich 
Schmidt has the speed to 
track down any ball carrier. 
Usually, it 's the guy who has 
just beaten him on a deep 
pattern. Jeff Barina and Bob 
Edmondson add class to the 
team. 

After atl Mark Bernard and 
Henry DeVries have paid 
their dues. After years of 
taking it on the chin from the 
big boys. the Athletic 
Supporters dropped down a 
level and obviously decided to 
return the favor. If you're 
looking for a strong candidate 
for 1M Sandbaggel'S of the 
Year ... look no further . This 
team is a shoo-in.

continued from page 1 
s how on ly one of four 
Americans' eligible to vote 
cast their ballots for Reagan 
- "hardly a mandate," he 
said. 

Weinglass added that 
students at the left end of the 
political spectrum can plan 
an increasingly constructive 
role in counteracting the 
government's swing to 
conservati m. 

He noted that in the 60s, 
labor viewed students a the 
"enemy ," but that as 
government has "o~anized 
against militant unionism," 
labor has shifted to -a more 
friendly view toward 
students.· 

Weinglass believes that the 
"st range marriage of 
government and manage-

ment" as demonstrated in 
the NASSCO case may be 
"the threshold ca e of the 
1980s," indicative of what is 
to come in government 
employer-employee relations .

Iran, Iraq both 
claim war victory 

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) 
- Iran and Iraq yesterday 
claimed four days of bloody 
fighting had given each 
control of the Iranian border 
town of Susangerd and each 
claimed the other suffered 
heavy casualties. Iran also 
reported fierce fighting at its 
besieged refining city, 
Abadan. 

Iran claimed 850 Iraqis 
were killed in three days of 
fighting in Susangerd, Iraq 
said 609 Iranians died in the 
saDle period. Iran said one of 
its aircraft crashed in 
Susangerd and claimed an 
Il'aQi helicopter was shot 
down by anti-aircraft fire as 
it tried to attack the city. 

An Iraqi communique said 
Iraqi forces "tightened the 
noose" around defenders of 
Susangerd, 35 miles 
northwest of the oil-rich 
Khuzistan provincial capital 
Ahwaz. 

Iran, which iirst claimed to 
have regained control of 
Susan~erd after a helicopter 
gunship and tank attack 
Monday, said its army 

regulars and Islamic 
revolutionary guards were 
mopping up Iraqi resistance 
near the city. 

The second big battle was 
reported under way 85 miles 
south of Susangerd at 
Abadan on the disputed 
north-south Shatt aI-Arab 
waterway, where oil tanks, 
refineries and pipelines have 
been burning since the war 
began Sept. 22. 

'the Iraqi command said 
150 Iranians were killed in an 
attempt to break out of a 
month·long siege of Abadan 
by attacking across the 
Bahmanshir River that runs 
east of the island city. 

The Iranians said they 
found 80 dead Iraqis on the 
battlefield east of Abadan and 
saw Iraqi ambulances 
picking up wounded and 
rushing across the Shatt aI-
Arab to Iraq's second largest 
city, Lasra. 

The Iraqi command said it 
sank three Iranian naval 
vessels in a sea battle in the 
northern waters of the 
Persian Gulf.

Reagan gets drs' plea 
for nuclear ban 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) 
- Doctors and atomic 
experts from across the 
country yesterday appealed 
to President-elect - Ronald 
Reagan to dismantle 
America's nuclear arsenal, 
saying there can be "no 
winners" in a thermonuclear 
war. 

In a tersley worded letter to 
Reagan, Physicians for Social 
Responsibility said "nuclear 
war, even limited, would 
result in death, injury and 
disease on a scale that has no 

precedenc~ in the" history of 
human exIstence. 

Dr. Helen Caldicott, 
president of the Boston-based 
group, read the letter during 
a news conference at a two-
day symposjum on nuclear 
w~, one of a series being 
presented around the 
country. 

The ~roup called on 
Reagan 'in the interest of 
protecting human life," to 
"diffuse current tensions 
between our country and the 
Soviet Union, ban the use of 
all nuclear weapons, and 

recognize the threat posed by 
the very existence our 
enormous nuclear arsenal 
alld begin to dismantle it." 

"Medical disaster planning 
would be meaningless" in the 
event of a nuclear attack, said 
the letter. "There would be 
no possible medical response. 
Most hospitals would be 
destroyed, most medical 
personnel dead or injured." 

"There is also no effective 
civil defense. The blast, 
thermal and radiation effects 
would kill even those in 
shelters, and the fallout 
would reach those who had 
been evacuated." 

Dr. Caldicott, Associate of 
Medicine at Boston's 
Children's Hospital, said that 
it is an "absolute necessity" 
to have a "properly 
informed" medical consul-
tant to the president on the 
medical effects of a nuclear 
war, and she offered the 
group's services to' · the 
incoming administration.

Lobby 
continued from page 1 
programs in the system will 
be extremely important 
is ues in upcoming years. 

"The university must take 
a socially responsible stance 
on issues such a affirmative 
action, its investment policy 
and the Los Alamos and 
Lawrence Livermore labora-
tories (weapons development 
and research facilities)," she 
said. 

Sabo, one member of the 
SBPC subcommittee that 
appointed Stelck, expects 
Stelck "will do a better than 
excellent job" as lobby co-
director. 

"All three finalists were 
very good," Sabo said. "We 
felt Kristin had the qualities 
most needed by the Lobby 
right now." 

One such quality is 
Stelck's ability to "articulate 
with administrators and 
mainstream politicians and 
also deal with non-traditional 
student groups," said Sabo. 

Stelck's experience 
includes extensive organiza-
tional work at the San Die!(o 
State University Women s 
Center and research through 
the UCB Associated Students 
Research Pr:>gram. She holds 
a BS in Women's Studies and 
political science from 
Berkeley. 

Lofgren. one of the finalists 
for the position, indicated his 
intention to fir> for a lot of 
other things' despite his 
rejection and praised Slelck 
a appearing "very profes· 
sional. " 

Lofgren added that he 
might apply for an intern 
coordinator and fundrai er 
position SBPC may create 
next spring.
