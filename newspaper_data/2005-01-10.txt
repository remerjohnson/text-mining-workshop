Women still trailing at universities 
Campus taking steps to support female faculty 

By CHRlmNE KWON 
Senior Staff Writer 

Both the number of women in 
higher education positions and 
their earnings continue to lag 
behind men and have seen little 
change over the last 25 years, a 
new study reviewing gender 
inequity reponed. 

Released by the American 
Association of University 
Professors, the study found that 
while women are well represented 
in lower-ranked positions and 
less-prestigious institutions, their 
numbers are small in higher-
ranked positions and institutions. 

AAUP Director of Research 
John Curtis said that the figures 
- based on the group's annual 
survey of faculty compensation, 
salaries, benefits and tenure status 
- indicate that women are still 
underrepresented in higher edu-
cation careers. 

"The usual explanation is to 
begin looking at individual fac-
tors," Curtis said. "What I'm sug-
gesting is that we need to give 
some consideration that it's not 
just an individual situation but 
that there might be some system-
atic barriers." 

UCSD chemistry and bio-
chemistry professor Katja 
Lindenberg, who co-chaired the 
campus' Gender Equity Task 
Force in 2002, said she believes 
most inequities in salary and posi-
tion at UCSD are generalJy indi-

Center "aims to advance women's intellectual, professional and personal goals." 
vidual cases and not systematic 
problems. 

The campus repon found that, 
on average, female faculty receive 
5.6 percent less pay than men for a 
nine-month year salary, which is 
nonetheless better than the 
national average. 

"On the whole, things were 
better at UCSD because the uni-
versity has a really elaborate sys-
tem that determines salaries," 
Lindenberg said. 

Some of the greatest disparities 
at UCSD exist in sciences, engi-
neering and at UCSD School of 
Medicine, medicine professor 
Kim Barrett stated in an e-mail. 

"We have to be constantly vig-

ilant that starting salaries are com-
parable for comparable faculty, 
and· also that women are consid-
ered for advancement and acceler-
ated promotions as often as men," 
Barrett stated. "We also need to 
change our culture that usually 
only considers major increases in 
salary or position when a faculty 
member is being recruited from 
outside the university - women 
are often not in a position to seek 
such offers." 

Barrett, who co-chaired the 
spring 2004 Health Sciences 
Gender Equity Task Force, noted 
that both the main campus and the

Researchers link protein, stem cells 
Second faculty member appointed to oversight board 

By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

San Diego scientists are 
advancing in the field of stem celJ 
research with a recent medical dis-
covery by UCSD associate profes-
sor Yang Xu and the appoinonent 
of Leon ThaI, professor and chair 
of the campus neurosciences 
department, to an oversight com-
mittee of the California Institute 
of Regenerative Medicine. 

Campus biologists, headed by 
Xu, have linked the existence of a 
specific protein, known as p53, 
with the cellular response to DNA 
damage. The discovery could 
explain how stem cells, which are 
capable of dividing an unlimited 
number of times and changing to 
become any type of cell in the 
body, are able to stop replication 
of celJs exhibiting genetic damage. 

"We have a hypothesis that it is 
DNA damage that induces embry-
onic stem celJs to [stop duplication 
and] differentiate, so they will be 
able to repair the damage and cure 
them," Xu said. "The outcome of 
an embryonic stem cell pool with 

extensive DNA damage would 
lead to multiple tissues and even-
tually even be passed on to your 
progeny." 

Scientists see the protein as one 
of the first mechanisms found for 
the suppression of tumors and 
other cancerous growths. The 
researchers, however, are continu-
ing to study the connection 
between the protein and DNA 
damage response. 

"We now have to understand 
how important this is in the tumor 
genesis," Xu said. "Would an 
embryo die or would an embryo 
live despite being cancer prone? 
And we would want to investigate 
other mechanisms and also loolc 
into human .embryonic stem cells." 

The finding followed the 
appointment of a second UCSD 
faculty member to the 
Independent Citizens Oversight 
Committee responsible for the 
administration of the California 
Institute of Regenerative 
Medicine and the spending of $3 
billion worth of bonds approved 
by voters for stem cell research. 

On Dec. 13, Gov. Arnold 

Schwarzenegger announced that 
Thai would join Vice Chancellor 
of Health and Sciences Edward H. 
Holmes, who also serves as dean 
of UCSD School of Medicine, on 
the 29-member oversight panel. 
The committee wilJ also include 
representatives from UC Irvine, 
UC San Francisco, UC Davis and 
UCLA, in addition to members 
from private industry and non-
profit groups. 

Established by the voter pas-
sage of Proposition 71 in the Nov. 
2 election, the California Institute 
of Regenerative Medicine is 
charged with the regulation of 
stem celJ research and the alJoca-
tion of grants for research and 
institutions. 

"The committee will develop 
the policies and procedures for the 
allocation of scientific grants as 
well as consider the moral issues of 
stem cell research," Thai said. "I 
want to commend the governor 
and the other people involved in 
the appointments for picking an 
outstanding group of people."

Man robs campus parking 
attendant at gunpoint 

Police believe same suspect to blame 
for January, December thefts 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

Police believe a student or cam-
pus affiliate may be responsible for 
robbing two parking attendants at 
gunpoint and stealing approxi-
mately $1,000 in parking proceeds. 

In the most recent theft, which 
occurred at approximately 7:40 
p.m. onJan. 5, a masked man armed 
with a revolver approached the 
North Campus information booth 
and demanded that the parking 
attendant on duty hand over 
approximately $540 in cash, accord-
ing to campus police Detective 
Yolanda Smith. The man fled down 
Ridge Walk on foot directly after 
the holdup, possibly to a vehicle 
parked in the vicinity of Lot 357. 

Smith said a dark scarf and 
beanie concealed the suspect's face, 
making the identification of even 
his race impossible. However, the 
attendant's description suggested 
that the man is in his 20s and has a 
thin build. 

"The victim said she saw his 
hands and said that they looked 
young," Smith said. 

The general description of the 
suspect and method of crime -
including concealing clothes and 
use of a revolver - match a 
December theft from a parking 
attendant working in Thornton 
Hospital, according to Smith. The 

Thornton robbery, which took 
place on Dec. 22, al 0 occurred on 
a Wednesday night, and police 
believe the same man may be 
responsible for both crimes. 

"We've pretty much canvas ed . 
the city as far as asking for any im-
ilar crimes and no one is having 
problems like this," Smith said. "So 
we're kind of thinking it might be a 
student or an affiliate." 

In the December robbery, the 
parking attendant told investiga -
tors the man was approximately 5 
feet 10 inches in height, though the 
wi mess in the most recent crimc 
described the man as 5 feet 5 inch-
es tal.!. However, Smith said the 
overall de cription and method of 
crimes of the suspects match. 

"If you have a gun pointed at 
you, people's description of height 
could be different," she said. 

The UCSD Police Department 
has taken precautionary steps in the 
event the man attempts another 
robbery, according to Corporal 
Kristeen McColJough, though she 
could not comment on plans in 
case the suspect is affiliated with 
the campus. 

"The deparonent will actively 
do things to prevent this from hap-
pening again ," McCollough said. 

At approximately 5 p.m . on Jan. 
7, an empty police crui er was

I BRIEFLY 
Another settlement reached 

in Enron class action 
The University of California has announced 

that it will move for a preliminary court approval 
of a $168 million settlement in a class-action 
lawsuit against former directors of the bankrupt 
energy giant Enron. 

Of the total settlement, insurance proceeds 
will pay $155 million and the remaining $13 
million will come from personal contributions 
of inSider tradin~ proceeds made by the direc-
tors, the university said. 

Under a deal reached on Oct. 6, the money 
will be held in trust until final approval of the 
agreement. 

"This is a further significant step toward what 
we hope will be a substantial recovery for the 
investor Victims of the Enron fraud," UC General 
Counsel James E. Holst stated in a university 
announcement "It is especially significant that 
these outside directors were made to disgorge 
some of their insider trading proceeds:' 

The agreement is the fourth one reached in 
the case, with recovery for the class totaling 
almost half a billion dollars. In 2004, the univer-
sity, as the lead plaintiff, reached settlements 
with a brokerage firm involved in the case and 
a bank that the suit accused of playing a role in 
the company's financial transactions. Another 
settlement was reached in 2002 with the inter-
national amn of the company's former auditor. 

A separate legal action against Enron's top 
executives and otner banks allegedly involved in 
the scam will continue, the university said. 

Democrats propose bill to 
reverse Pel! Grant changes 

Three Democratic lawmakers in the 
House of Representatives have offered legis-
lation to restore Pell Grant awards to the 
nearly 90,000 students expected to lose aid 
under new tax tables announced by the 
Department of Education. 

The department moved to update the state 
tax Information used for determining federal 
finanCial aid as a result of a major spending bill 
passed by Congress, which did not contain lan-
guage prohibiting such updates. Since 1994, 
Similar provisions mandated the Education 
Department to use 1988 tax data. 

Under the new tax tables, some students in 
48 states are expected to lose at least part of 
their Pell Grants while students in Connecticut 
will see their aid increase slightly. 

The one-paragraph bill, introduced by Reps. 
Rush Holt (D-N.J.) and Tim Bishop (D-N.Y.) 
would prevent the department from using the 
new tax tables in cases where they would 
reduce aid. The bill is cosponsored by Rep. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 10, z005 

George Miller (D-Calif.), who expressed vocal 
criticism of the changes. 

Republican lawmakers have defended the 
use of new data, sa~ng that they would bene-
fit poor students and reduce the deficit in the 
Pell Grant program. 

Colorado govemor calls for 
crime-free scholarship 

Colorado Gov. Bill Owens has called on the 
state's legislature to pass legislation creating a 
new $50 million scholarship for low-income 
eighth- and ninth-graders. 

However, there is a catch: To qualify, stu-
dents must promise not to use drugs, alcohol 
or tobacco, 'and otherwise stay out of trouble." 

In addition, Colorado students will need to 
maintain minimum grades, pass certain prereq-
uisite courses and be eligible for the federal 
Pell Grant. 

'This new program will tackle the two biggest 
barriers to college access: lack of academic 
preparation and money to pay for college," stat-
ed Rick O'Donnell, executive director of the 
state's Commission on Higher Education, whose 
department will manage the new program. 

Under the plan, fundin g would come from 
profits made by the state company that admin-
isters student loans. It would be used to satisfy 
·unmet' aid - the amount left over after all 
other financial aid and student contributions 
are subtracted from total college costs. 

To receive the Colorado Achievement 
Scholarship, students will need to maintain a 
minimum 2.5 GPA and commit to not vi01ate 
laws or use controlled substances, according to 
the program's official description. 

The governor did not say how the state 
would make sure students followed through on 
that commitment. 

Iraqi advisor to speak at 
campus lecture event 

Dana Eyre, a former aid coordinator who 
worked with the U.S. government's Agency 
for International Development on the recon-
struction of Iraq, will speak about challenges 
in the run-up to the country's Jan. 30 elec-
tions. 

Eyre will lead a lecture scheduled for 7 p.m. 
on Jan. 10 at Great Hall. 

Before returning from Iraq in November, he 
seNed as a senior adviser to USAID, focusing on 
issues of democracy and governance, and led a 
part of the Coalition Provisional Authority's civic 
education program. 

Prior to his work in Iraq, Eyre also seNed for 
three years as a senior adviser to the United 
Nations' mission in Kosovo.

MONDAY, JANUARY 10,2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

. Gender: Men dominate at prestigious schools 
continued from page I 

medical school are monitoring 
apparent salary inequities and rec-
tifying them when warranted. 

In 2004, men constituted 90 
percent of tenured facuJty in the 
physical and biological sciences 
and at UCSD School of Medicine, 
and 93 percent atJacobs School of 
Engineering, the 2004 task force 
and the Office of Academic 
Affirmative Action found. 

Economics professor julian 
Betts, also a task force committee 
member, describes the cause of this 
imbalance as a "whole pipeline." In 
this "leaky pipeline," women drop 
out of academic careers before 
becoming fully tenured professors, 
according to Barrett. 

"At every single step of that 
pipeline, you see women being 
diverted from academic careers, 
especially so in science and mathe-
matics," Betts said. 

Despite these inequities, the 
university has been very sensitive 
to the issue, Lindenberg said. 
Psychology professor Donald 
MacLeod, who served on the 2002 
committee, said he saw little evi-
dence of "gross inequities" at 
UCSD, but that different academ-
ic profiles for women may compli-
cate matters. 

"Men are more inclined to per-
haps promote themselves, and they 
may tend to publish more, whereas 
women do a better joh in teaching 
and service," MacLeod said. 

The AAUP report suggests that 
gender equity problems may not 
only be a question of policies but 
also one of "climate and culture," 
and that universities should create 
environments that encourage 
women to pursue academic careers, 
Curtis said. 

The 2003·04 study shows "little 
improvement in the salary gap over 

25 years of higher education histo-
ry." Women earn 80 percent of 
what men earn across all ranks and 
institutions, it found. Women earn 
96 percent of mens salaries at com-
munity colleges without position 
rankings, 89 percent at baccalaure-
ate institutions and 78 percent at 
doctoral-level institutions, suggest-
ing a correlation between an insti-
tutions prestige and its gender gap. 

Curtis also said that women are 
less represented in higher-ranked, 
full-tenure positions because of the 
conflicts between the pursuit of an 
academic career and family com-
mitments. 

"It seems that, in an academic 
career, you have to be fully com-
mitted for a long period - 20 to 25 
years of essentially continuous 
commitment to career," Curtis 
said. "Women are really forced to 
choose between pursuing an acade-
mic career or having a family." 

Universities have been slow to 
address issues of work-family bal· 
ance, AAUP associate secretary 
Julie Schmid stated in an e-mail. 

"Just because we've provided 
access doesn't mean we've leveled 
the playing field," Schmid said. 
"One of the most important 
[changes) would be for universities 
to make a sustained commitment 
to recruiting and retaining women 
faculty. Part of what this requires is 
offering equitable, competitive 
salaries. It also requires providing 
mentoring to junior women facul-
ty." 

Over the years, UCSD has 
taken several significant steps in 
addressing the problem of child-
rearing for women faculty, accord-
ing to Lindenberg, who arrived at 
the university in 1969. 

"The university has come in an 
enormous way for instituting poli-
cies to make it much, much easier 

to raise a family," Lindenberg said. 
"When I came here, for a normal 
pregnancy, you got two weeks 
[off]. " 

Barrett also stated that, while 
the campus has been "q uite fam-
i1y-friendly," the task force 
found that many faculty mem-
bers are not aware of the 
improved child-bearing policies 
or worry that they will be stig-
matized if they ask to take 
advantage of them. Childcare 
facilities also need to be 
improved and expanded, she 
stated. 

American Council on 
Education Vice President Claire 
Van Ummersen, director of the 
organization's Office of Women in 
Higher Education, said that the 
AAUP study reflects only a "snap-
shot" of the time, and that the 
number of women in higher-
ranked posirions is improving, par-
ticularly in the position of assistant 
professor. 

"The pool is certainly there," 
Van Ummersen said. "In 2003 , for 
the first time, women Ph.D.s hit 
the 50-percent mark. What needs 
tn happen is that the policies that 
are already in place be put into 
practice." 

Curtis said that the AAUP will 
be working on a more detailed 
analysis of gender equi ty in educa-
tional institutions. A UCSD 
School of Medicine climate survey 
is also being conducted, according 
to Barrett. 

"What we're trying to do here 
is stimulate fresh conversation and 
ask colleges and universities - and 
the faculty themselves - to take 
another look at the system," Curtis 
said .

DC should consider going private 
University of Virginia, Berkeley Law School exploring options 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Opinion Editor 

Public, state-supported colleges 
have always represented the blue 
collar everyman, promising higher 
education for those qualified to 
artend. Unfornmately, as state bud-
gets have nose-dived into the red, 
governments have been less and less 
able to support public universities, 
causing a seemingly endless string 
of budget cuts and fee increases. 
Ironically: this has caused private 
schools - with their generous 
endowments - to become more 
viable options for low-income stu-
dents. For example, while the 
University of California reduces 
financial aid, Harvard University 
meets 100 percent of student need 
wi th grants. 

The University of Virginia, 
Virginia Tech and the College of 
William and Mary recently 
responded to this new financial 
reality by proposing the Chartered 
University Initiative 
(http://www. virginia .edul chartere-
duniversitieslindex.hmu), a piece of 
legislation that would allow the uni-
versities to become autonomous 
political units under the state of 
Virginia in return for reduced state 
funding - in other words, de facto 
private schools. The University of 
Virginia 's Web site cites "unpre-
dictable tuition levels," top faculty 
being recruited away and insuffi -
cient money for financial aid as rea-
sons for making the change. Sound 
fa miliar' 

The idea is not as preposterous 
as one might think. UCSD receives 
OIu y 18.6 percent of its ftmding 
from the state of Californi a, a ntnn-
ber th~t will inevitably fall as the 
universi ty'S funding needs grow 
faste r than state support, which has 
fa llen the past three years. More 

tellingly, a November 2004 study 
by UC Berkeley professor emeritus 
Charles Schwartz indicates that UC 
undergraduates already pay 95 per-
cent of the cost of their education. 
The university claims the true fig-
ure is 30 percent, while Schwartz 
argues that his study more accurate-
ly represents the true cost of educa-
tion by omitting expenses related to 
faculty and graduate research. The 
University of California also 
receives an enormous portion of its 
funding for research from the fed-
eral government and private grants, 
with relatively little from the state. 

"If you were to ask me what sig-
nal I can imagine most clearly des-
ignates the transition from public to 
private sta tus, I would say Ii t's) 
when undergraduate student fees 
cross the line of paying for more 
than 100 percent of the actual cost 
of their education at the institu-
tion," Schwartz stated in his report. 

The University of Virginia was-
n't the only public university to 
drink the Kool-Aid in recent 

months. UC Berkeley'S Boalt 
School of Law announced earlier 
this month that it, too, would like to 
join the University of Virginia and 
the University of Michigan in the 
ranks of more-private-than-public 
law schools. Boalt Dean 
Christopher Edley, Jr. believes 
increased autonomy from the state 
is the only way the school can take 
decisive action to remedy its 
uncompetitive faculty compensa-
tion packages and insufficient 
financial aid for top students. Is 
there an echo in this stoty, or what? 

Of course, given these univer-
sities' budget problems, it seems 
counterintuitive to turn down 
state funding; after all, wouldn't 
that result in even less funding? In 
the University of Virginia's 
case, campus adminis-
trators believe 
that autono-
my would 
allow 
their 

university to function more effi-
ciently even with reduced state 
funding. And by offering to take a 
IO-percent cut in state funding in 
return for that autonomy, the uni-
versity is putting its money where 
its mouth is. 

It's impossible to know whether 
the University of California as a 
whole could benefi t from the same 
efficiency gains that the University 
of Virginia and UC Berkeley's law 
school believe they can. But given 
how seriously many of the universi-
ty's peers are taking these proposals, 
it would be foolish of us not to look 
long and hard at the possibility 
instead of merely seeking to tread 
water through short-term compacts 
with the state. 

Council errs in rejecting I no confidence' 
By BRIAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Recently, the A.S. Council 
overwhelmingly voted in opposi-
tion to a measure that would have 
allowed a "vote of no confidence" 
to appear on their ballot, forcing 
ca ndidates to defeat the "no confi-
dence" option to take office. With 
equally heated arguments for and 
against this option - stating that 
the prospect of dumping all candi-
dates for a particular office would 
either drastically add to or reduce 
the amount of petty politics 
involved in A.S. elections - we 
must step back and look at the 
elections process as a whole to 
make any sense out of the mad-
ness. 

With our highly contested 
na tional election out of the way, it 
is time for the collective eye of 
UCS D to turn toward the campus' 
own political squabbling. For 
freshman readers who haven 't seen 
ca mpus politics in action, picture 
two weeks in March when every 
mental patient this campus has to 
offer comes out of the woodwork 
to viciously fight every other men-
ta l patient while attempting to 
verball y assault every passing stu-
dent with an array of homemade 
propaganda. 

This may seem like a somewhat 
unfair portrait of our campus lead-
ers' race for power, but it's not far 
off. In this breeding ground for 
future career politicians, these stu-

dents take the race very, very seri-
ously. A space on the pavement or 
a poster in Price Center becomes 
grounds for an all-out gang war 
between any number of warring 
factions, in the hopes that the 
slightest advantage will place the 
student in the gilded seat on the 
A.S. Council. 

Unfortunately, despite the 
legitimate amount of concern stu-
dents should feel about the A.S. 
Council and the million dollars it 
throws around each year (funding 
the annual Sun God Festival, 
among other endeavors), Joe and 
Jane Student don't care about stu-
dent counci l elections, as evi-
denced by the voter turnout, 
which seems to perpetually hover 
around a scam 15 percent. 

Perhaps it is this dreaded stu-
dent apathy which caused this 
year's A.s. Council to overwhelm-
ingly vote down the measure that 
would allow a "vote of no confi-
dence" to appear alongside the 
names of the candidates on 
March's upcoming A.S. ballot. 
After all, the "abstain" option 
overwhelmingly wins every office 
except that of A.S. President every 
year, in addition to garnering the 
most votes when something 
important like a fee referendum is 
on the ballot, so why give these 
apathetic students the option to 
throw out the election results 
entirely? 

There's actually a very good 
reason, and that is because most of 

the people whose offices are in 
danger of losing to "no confi-
dence" are those colloquially 
known as uslate fillers." Since elec-
tion bylaws allow higher spending 
limits to a student political party 
that has a full ticket, candidates for 
larger offices often fill spots wi th 
unqualified candidates to add 
these candidates' ~ampaign 
expenses to their own campaign, 
even if these students never lift a 
finger during their own candidacy 
and do not care about their elect-
ed office. 

This year, more than half of the 
A.S. Council quit and was replaced 
during the first couple of months 
of their term. Yet somehow, 
despite the fact that most of the 
college senators have jumped ship, 
the A.S. Council is still doing a 
competent job with no major 
errors so far this year. This is pos-
sible because when a student 
politician quits, the council as a 
whole appoints somebody who is 
actually qualified to do the job. 
This process of appointment was 
used to fill a majority of council 
seats both ·this year and last year; 
both of these counci ls were very 
strong and managed to get work 
done. Since this same process 
would be used in the case of a "no 
confidence" vote, the A.S. Council 
does not need to worry about los-
ing its most able members j f "no 
confidence" wins an office or two. 

Since the election process 
would essentially be the same 

(appointment by the winning 
president), the only difference one 
would see in A.S. Council elec-
tions would be increased student 
input. In the words of Warren 
College Student Council 
President Erik Ward during the 
debate over the "no confidence" 
vote: "What is [council) afraid ot?" 
Student politicians never seem to 
talk to students outside the A.S. 
circuit, so why not offer a chance 
for the conunon voter to actually 
voice an opinion? 

The recent political quagmire 
in November between President 
George W. Bush and Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mass.) found a large 
segment of the population fed up 
and disillusioned with both candi-
dates; a "no confidence" option on 
the ballot would have much more 
accurately represented voter 
intent than the quasi -jihad "red vs. 
blue" mentality purveyed on 
CNN. If UCSD student politics 
truly are the training ground for 
career politicians, why not force 
them to campaign honestly to beat 
the "no confidence" option 
instead of forcing them to cam-
paign negatively to beat each 
other' An introduction of the "no 
confidence" ,option would easily 
clean up ASUCSD elections with-
in a year or two by removing the 
petty politics. 

Yet, the double-edged sword of 
student apathy has its own prob-

Grades 
corrupt 
learning 
process 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

4 

I na perfect world, there would be no exams. No papers. No quizzes. No deadlines. No all-
nighters. No grades. No plagiarism. 
No cheating. There'd be no need. 
Labs and projects might still exist, 
but they would be completely 
optional. As such, learning would be 
everywhere; learning would be bliss. 

Of course, in the madly imper-
fect world in which we live, school 
requires all these mechanisms to 
keep students in line and learning. 
As a flawed people, we live in need 
of rules and discipline to restrain 
our desires and to suppress our 
laziness. 

School is a prime example of 
this. While high sc hool also had 
requirements, college is a bit differ-
ent in its all ocation of freedom. For 
one thing, going to coll ege in the 
first place is not compul ory. 
Secondly, the only person responsi-
ble for your attendance is you . 
Students choose their majors and 
most of their classes. Choices and 
enjoyment usually go hand in hand . 

Yct after almost four years at 
this university, it's become increas-
ingly clear that the culture of 
studying is similar to that of politics 
- it is somewhat corrupted. 
Politicians are public servants. And 
more and more, they depend on 
the deep pocke ts of lobbying 
groups, rich corporations and indi-
viduals who in turn see their inter-
ests represented in government. 
The noble purpose of politics - to 
serve all citizens - has been per-
verted by multimillion-dollar 
donations, sustained by bombastic 
yet hardly substantive rhetoric, and 
has resulted in cynicism about a.ll 
things political. Likewise, school 
and studying - supposedly intend-
ed to facilitate learning - have 
arguably developed negative con-
notations . Isn't the point of study-
ing to learn what we wish to learn? 
Now, it has mostly become an 
obligation for earning a grade . 
Hence the concept of cramming -
absorbing a bunch of information 
in a short period of time to be used 
solely for exam regurgitation, not 
for long-term retention. "Public 
service" is not what first comes to 
mind when someone utters "poli-
tics." Nor is "attaining knowledge" 
the first that comes to mind when 
"studying" or "school" is men-
tioned. 

The warped process of learning 
that is college academics, while 
pervasive, is also sometimcs star-
tling. I came to a point last year, 
while writing a final paper with the 
typical obligatory feeling of drcad, 
where I started wondering, "What's 
wrong with this picture?" I had 
chosen the class because it sounded 
interesting. Some of the material 
was boring, but I liked the premise 
of most of it. The professor was 
tolerable. \Nhy did I dread writing 
this paper? Why did I always? I 
liked learning. What gives? 

I'd argue that my motivation

was the problem. I wanted that U A." 
When it comes down to it, a grade 
is actually a pretty flimsy goal. But 
once you start thinking about an 
important career objective that 
requires good grades, or maybe 
really pressure-pushing parents or 
perfectionist rigor, working harder 
seems more important. But the 
pure thrill of learning is probably 
the best motivator. 

triumph over the tyranny of the 
grade, to escape from the obligo-
academics matrix. For instance, 
taking classes passino pass is not 
the slacker option some may see it 
as. To be freed from the grade may 
just mean to be free to learn. A 
great example of this is the fresh-
man and undergraduate seminar 
program. Covering a variety of top-
ics, these seminars offer students 
one unit of credit and can only be 
graded with PINP. Thus, students 
enroll only because they want to 
learn and are not burdened with 
any impending tests or papers. 

Many times, professors also 
make the difference by portraying 
material as either dull or delightful. 
The passion teachers exude can 
make studying seem worthwhile.

R I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Recruiter access 

necessary 
Dear Editor: 
You are sorely mistaken in 

that military r.ecruiter access 
shouldn 't be linked to accep-
tance of federal funding 
["Funding shouldn't be tied to 
recruiter accecss ," Jan . 6) . 

As a stockholder in the 
"United States of America" cor-
poration, I take exception to your 
holding out one hand for funding 
while using the otller to hold the 
door closed for recruiter access . If 
you want the money, you allow 

access - it's so simple even a the-
ater arts major could understand 
it. 

The one little aspect that you 
fail to take into consideration 
with allowing military recruiters 
on campus is this: There is no gun 
being held to anyone's head to 
enlist in the military. 

VVhat do you have to fear from 
their presence on campus' 
Nothing - unl ess you don 't 
understand that "free to think" 
concept and worry that people 
will realize you have no tangible 
argument.

In addition to that momentary 
epiphany (which was abruptly ended 
by the realization that the paper was 
due in 48 hours) some other revela-
tions I've had throughout the year. 
For instance, consider the term 
"overstudying"; the very existence of 
this term testifies to the twisted state 
of academics. \Nhat's been forgotten 
by others and myself is that tests and 
papers are incentives - means, not 
ends. It seems that this fact has been 
hopelessly lost, especially amid a 
competitive, elite school such as 
UCSD. Leaming is the objective of 
taking a class. Unfortunately, a stu-
dent who has managed to score an 
"A" with hardly any studying is often 
held in much more awe than a stu-
dent who has learned quite a lot but 
only pulled a "B." Of course, in 
another version of a perfect world, 
students who like to learn would get 
the "A." 

I took a sma.l.l, upper-division 
major class in which the professor 
required students to state our rea-
sons for taking the class. Even this 
simple act cha.l.lenged my hardened 
mindset; to hear everyone's brief 
description of the interests and back-
grounds that led to their class choice 
reminded me how lucky we all were 
to be studying what we might love. 

Unopposed: System should be phased in 

It again comes down to human 
nature. People do not like to be 
forced to do anything. If someone 
forced another person to do some-
thing he or she loved, that person 
might begin to love it less. Especially 
in the United States, where freedom 
is a right and anything less cramps 
our style, the application of any sort 
of coercion takes away potential joy 
from the endeavor. 

Yet there must be some way to 

Exams and papers will likely 
never be abolished. Even though 
"mandatory learning" should rea.lly 
become an anachronism, the con-
straints and corruption of the acad-
emic process can still be mitigated. 
The responsibility to glean joy 
from studying is wholly on us, and 
maybe all it takes is a moment of 
reflection on why we study at all. 
Indeed, a perfect world may exist 
somehow - not in physical form, 
but in essence, within ourselves.

lems. Even though "no confi-
dence" may give an apathetic Stu-
dent body a chance to offer con-
structive criticism of the "slate-
filler" system, it also provides an 
equal chance to offer all student 
politiCians the finger and throw 
the entire system into anarchy. If 
"no confidence" were an option, 
there is a decent chance in the first 
couple of years that an over-
whelming majority (think 90 per-
cent) of all student politicians 
would lose. As enticing as it may 
be, this "gallows" option on the 
ballot would sca re away many 
good politicians as well as "slate 
fillers. "

Even though they might not 
act like it during election season, 
politicians are people too, and 
often have very sensitive feelings 
surrounding student council elec-
tions . Sobbing and screaming are 
familiar sights during the reading 
of election results; it does not take 
an extreme stretch of the imagina-
tion to see that more severe reac-
tions would be added to the lnix if 
complete and abject failure were a 
likely result for politicians. 

So, even though the "no confi-
dence" option would ultimately 
create a better democratic system 
for our student council check-
writers, the initiation of the 
process would probably hinder the 
elections completely for a couple 
of years, threatening Sun God or

producing some other comparable 
calamity. It would be a better idea 
to slowly phase in " no co nfi -
dence," begin with some less 
severe penal ty, or leave it out 
entirely and look to other meth-
ods to keep student poli ticians in 
line. 

Besides, did yo u reall y expect 
a group of politicians to volun-
tarily vote in a measure that 
would hurt their chances of 
being elected? Given this coun-
ci l's history of rewriting the elec-
tions bylaws after every election

highly unlikely. But the very con-
sideration of such an idea gives 
hope for the future that th e

interests of all students. Just as

MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Theft: Campus recorded three robberies in 2003 
continued from page I 

parked in the drive-thru of the 
North Campus information booth. 
The parking attendant inside 
declined to comment, citing con-
cerns that the suspect was a campus 
student and would read about her 
remarks in the paper. 

Transportation and Parking 
Services Director Gregory M. Snee 
was not immediately avai lable for 
comment . 

In addition to the robberies, the 
police department has recorded a 
spike in bike theft over the three-
week winter break, though final 
numbers are not yet avai lable, 
according to McCollough. 

Earlier in December, police 
arrested a man on Library Walk 
suspected of posting chjld pornog-
raphy on library computers at sev-
eral San Diego college campuses. 
He was charged with a total of 29 
felony counts of distributing child 
pornography. 

The 31-year-old was also sus-

peeted of using a camera phone to 
take pictures beneath stall doors in 
a Price Center women's restroom 
on Dec. I, according to 
McCollough, though he was not 
charged with any crimes related to 
the incident. 

However, McCollough said the 
recent incidents were isolated and 
did not indicate a larger trend of 
growing campus crime. 

Tn 2003, UCSD recorded a total 
of three robberies for the year, and 
just one the year before, according 
to annual crime statistics. Between 
1999 and 2000, no robberies were 
reported to campus police. 

Though (he campus matches 
UC Irvine with the lowest officer-
to-population ratio in the UC sys-
tem, McCollough said the rob-
beries will likely not lead to 
changes in staffing levels. As of 
2003, the department employed 0.6 
officers for every 1,000 people on 
campus, compared to 1. 3 officers at 
the university'S San Francisco cam-

pus, which has the highest ratio. 
"A robbery is not something 

that we can plan for," McCollough 
said . "Realistically, without having 
a really big problem with it, it's 
hard for us to direct our resources 
solely to that because there is so 
much going on at the campus." 

At the time of the crimes, how-
ever, the department was in the 
process of accepting applications 
for new officer positions, accordi ng 
to McCollough, a process she says 
will continue. 

"We 3re recruiting right now, 
and we're doi ng interviews to hire 
more officers," she said. 

Police have asked any witnesses 
who may have seen the suspect 
escape on Jan . 5 or noted a suspi-
cious vehicle in the North Campus 
parking lots at the time to call the 
campus police department at (858) 
534-HELP.

Cervical cancer vaccine

Vaccine fights STO that can

cause cancer In women 
8y SHAUNA KANEL 

Contributing Writer 

College students know that 
having unprotected sex can lead 
to all sorts of undesirable conse-
quences such as pregnancy and 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
But for a small number of 
women, it can also lead to cervi-
cal cancer. This goes against 
everyth ing we are taught about 
cancer - that it is a malignant 
disease with no cure - but cer-
vical cancer is different in this 
respect. 

Almost every case of cervical 
cancer is caused by a long-term 
infection with one of 10 com-
mon strains of human papilloma 
virus, or HPv. Of these cases, 
half are cau ed by 'the HPV-16 
strain and another 20 percent 
are caused by the HPV- IS 

strain, according to the National 
Cancer Instirute. . 

A disease that causes warts on 
the hands, feet, mouth and gen-
itals, HPV is the most common 
STD and is difficult to avoid for 
those who are sexually active. In 
fact, 75 percent of women and 
men contract HPV at one point 
in their lives, but in most cases, 
the infection will go away with-
out causing a problem. For a 
small number of women that 
con tract persistent infections, 
however, there is a high danger 
of developing cervical cancer, 
because a chronic infection with 
HPV is almost always known to 
preceed the development of this 
disease. 

Cervical cancer is the second 
most common cancer in women. 
Each year, 470,000 women are 
diagnosed with cervical cancer

worldwide. Approximately 80 
percent of these cases occur in 
developing countries, and about 
half of these women will die 
from the disease. The medical 
advances in treating cervical 
cancer have given women in 
developed countries a far greater 
chance of surviving. This year 
in the United States, about 
15,000 women will learn that 
they have cervical cancer, and 
more than 4,000 women will die 
because of it. 

But there is new hope for 
women at risk of developing this 
cancer: a vaccine for HPV: In 
November of 2002, scientists 
developed a vaccine against the 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 infec-
tions, the two most prominent 
precuresors to cervical cancer. 
It is possible that, within five 
years, this vaccine will be avail-
able to prevent the contraction 
of HPV; thereby eliminating the 
possibility of their causing cervi-
cal cancer. 

Dr. Douglas Lowy, a 
National Cancer Institute scien-
tist developed the vaccine. 
Since its creation, the govern-
ment has given the rights to 
develop the vaccine to two com-
panies: Merck and

GlaxoSmithKline. The latter is 
currently calling the vaccine 
Cervarix. 

Scientific testing is currently 
underway to determine the 
effectiveness and the possible 
side effects of Cervarix. The 
study, published in both the 
New England Journal of 
Medicine and in the Journal of 
the American Medical 
Association, involved 2,392 
women from 16 to 23 years of 
age. The women were random-
ly chosen to receive three injec-
tions, given at day tero, month 
two and month six, of either a 
placebo or an HPV-16/HPV-lS 
vaccine. All of the women test-
ed negative for the HPV-16 
infection at the time of their 
enrollment in the study. Of the 
women who received the place-
bo, 41 developed an HVP-16 
infection, and nine of these 
women went on to develop pre-
cancerous lesions on their 
cervixes. In contrast, none of 
the women who received the 
vaccine developed an HPV- 16 
infection. 

Based on the results of the 
study, scientists said the vaccine 
was 9l-percent effective against 
infection with the two most dan-

gerous strains of HPV; and it 
provided tOO-percent protec-
tion against the persistent infec-
tions that can lead to cancer. 
According to the scientists who 
conducted the study, the vaccine 
is safe and produced few side 
effects. However, the vaccine 
does not prevent HPV-16 or 
HPV-18 infections already pre-
sent in a patient from progress-
ing to cancer. 

If this vaccine makes it to the 
market, it will be the second 
developed to prevent cancer. 
The first is the vaccine devel-
oped to fight hepatitis B, which 
has gready reduced the number 
of infections that lead to liver 
cancer. Both vaccines take a 
similar route, immuruzmg 
against a seperate virus that is 
known to be a major cause of a 
particular cancer. 

A second study was done that 
looked at the relation between 
the incidence of developing cer-
vical cancer, the new HPV-
161HPV-l8 vaccine and the fre-
quency of screening. The study, 
published in the August B,

an illness, has been said to roam 
the halls of the hotel with dead, 
gray eyes and pale, bluish skin, 
lifelessly holding a doll at her side. 

Israel still wanders the lighthouse 
aimlessly. It has been reported 
that the alarm, installed for secu-
rity reasons, goes off sporadically 
at night and officials who rush to 
the lighthouse never find anyone 
at the scene. Off the cliffs, it has 
been said that Israel's gunshots 
can still be heard and the smell of 
fresh-baked bread can be detected 
outside the house. A rocking chair 
and the sound of Israel's wi fe 's 
knitting needles have been heard 
on the ground floor of the light-
house. On a foggy night, witness-
es have seen swirls of red mixed in 
with fog coming from the light-
house as it still shines off the coast 
of Point Loma . The lighthouse 
hours are 9 a.m. to 6: 15 p.m. 
(summer through Labor Day) and 
9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. (winter hours). 
Access . to. the lighthouse is 
through the Cabrillo Monument 
entrance; admission is $5, and it is 
open seven days a week.

Last but not least is the Point 
Loma Lighthouse, at the Cabrillo 
Monument on the south end of 
Catalina Bouleva rd, Point Loma. 
History proclaims that in 1854, 
the lighthouse became a working 
site and saw 10 different house-
keepers . In 1871 , Captain Robert 
D. Israel became the most weI/-
known of the housekeepers and 
ran the lighthouse for 20 years 
with his wife and four sons. 
Israel's duty was to fire his gun 
into the air and warn ships thjlt 
were getting too close to the 
coast. The house was abandoned 
in 1891 and remained so for 40 
years; in 1913, President 
Woodrow Wilson declared the 
lighthouse a national monument. 
Ln 1933, the land was bought to 
erect a monument to Juan 
Rodriquez Cabrillo and work 
began to restore the lighthouse to 
its original condition. 

The building, which stands 
422 feet a bove sea level, evokes a 
sense of mystery and loneliness.

OQINK TANK 
Mai Tai 

Originally served in 1944 using 17 -year-old Jamaican rum 
(I, Wny & Nephew), the first Mai ,\ai was a rich, golden 
cocktail swirled with 't-joice and ' ther tropical flavors, 
\Vith fresh lime juice, a ' t of 0 ge curacao, a dash of 
Roel, Candy Syrup and a g us portion of French 
Orgeat for almond flavoring, this concoction comes very 
close to being "out of this world" - or, in Tahitian, ",oi

Cancer: Annual STD testing 
for women recommended 

continued from Aage 8 
showed that although the vaccine 
prevented the contraction of a 
persistent HPV- 16 or HPV-) 8 
infection in sexually active 
women, those who received "vac-
cination lin conjunction withj 
annual screening beginning at age 
18 had the largest overa ll reduc-
tion in cancer incidence and mor-
tality." 

This may seem like an obvious 
conclusion, but according to one 
national health survey, one fifth of 
women between the ages of 18 
and 64 have not had a pap smear 
test in the last three years. Being 

tested for STDs and precancerous 
lesions is argu ably the most 
important way a woman can pre-
vent the contraction of a ser ious 
infection like the one that can lead 
to cervical cancer. 

Even if this new HPV vacci ne 
never does make it to the market, 
these studies further confirm that 
regu lar screening plays an essen-
tial role in preve nting STD infec-
tion. While experts hope that in a 
few years time there will be a 
widespread vaccination against 
HPV-16 and HPV- ) 8, they rec-
ommend that women are tested 
annually for STDs.

1he Kite Runner' depicts Afghanistan's 
history as both troubling and beautiful 

r.-----------------------I ALEX'S SALON & BEAUTY SUPPLY

Mlc:rodermabrasJon By FABlANNE FURMAN 
Contributing Writer 

When reading "The Kite 
Runner," any preconceptions the 
reader may have about life in 
Afghanistan are knocked away and 
replaced by the true experiences of 
a native Afghani. [n this book, 
Khaled Hos eini tells a story about 
a boy growing up in Afghanistan in 
the second half of the 20th century. 
The novel is narrated by a privi-
leged young boy living in Kabul 
before the Russian invasion, and he 
depicts the country in a way one 
would not commonly imagine, 
Despite everyday prejudices and 
strict schooling, the boy loves his 
country's traditions, food, friendly 
people and beautiful landscapes. 
Through the narrator, Afghanistan 
is portrayed as home: comforting, 
peaceful, pleasant. However, as the 
boy grows older, he witnesses an 
Afghani corrimit brutality against a 
countryman and is forced to come 
to terms wi th the severi ty of the 
religious intolerance that exists in 
his home country. Filled with dis-
crimination, poverty, war and 
death, "The Kite Runner" evolves 
to tell a story so disturbing and so 
haunting that it seems almost unre-
al. The most shocking aspect of all , 
however, is that the book is histori -
cal, and this is precisely wliat makes 
it so important to read. 

More than just describing a for-
eign country and its struggle for sta-
bility and peace, "The Kite Runner" 
focuses on a friendshi p berween a 
wealthy Sunni Muslim boy and his 
servant, a Shia Muslim, at a time 
when Sunnis are oppressing Shiites. 
The strong bond that exists 
berween the rwo boys is constandy 
tried by the religious discrimination 
in Afghanistan . While the reader 

wants the friendship to overcome its 
obstacles, this is not that type of 
book. The protagonist is no hero. 
He does not do things that an 
everyday person could not do. He is 
fallible and even cruel at times. The 
reader watches him make serious 
mistakes, some almost unforgivable. 
Still, he is a Iika hIe character 
because he is human and not extra-
ordinary as protagonists tend to be. 
The reader relates to his fears and 
views him as a real person, someone 
the reader might even know. The 

" 'The Kite Runner' 
evolves to teU a story so 
disturbing and so haunt, 
ing that it seems almost 

unreal. " 
fact that the protagonist is so nor-
mal makes "The Kite Runner" a 
believable, engaging book. 

Throughout the tale, the narra-
tor constandy refers back to a time 
when he was 12 years old and his 
whole life changed. The critical 
moment comes when the narrator 
does not he! p a loyal friend who is 
in a dangerous situation . The 
moment haunts the protagonist 
every day of his life, until he makes 
the choice to redeem himself 20 
years later. The book then becomes 
a painful and shocking adventure 
story involving poverty, murder and 
confrontations with the Taliban 
government. In the end, the book 
tends to leave the reader with a 
feeling of both fulfillment and sad-
ness. 

While Hosseini's book is not dif-

ficult to read, it is difficult to 
endure. There are moments that 
may cause the reader to wince, 
cringe or cry, along with unpleasant 
surprises evoking shock and dis-
tress. However, as a respected char-
acter says in the book, "Sad stories 
make good books." This could not 
be truer for "The Kite Runner." 

Hosseini is not a "pretty" writer. 
His rhetoric is not poetic or flow-
ery, and he does not overuse fancy 
adjectives or similes. His book is 
straightforward and to-the-point, 
making it feel as if the reader is lis-
tening to someone tell a story. 
"The Kite Runner" is important to 
read because it gives the reader fur-
ther insight and understanding 
cancerning development of current 
events in the Middle East today. It 
portrays Afghanistan through the 
eyes of an Afghan-American who 
escaped the Russian invasion, wit-
nessed the Taliban's brutality first-
hand, and was in the United States 
during the Sept. II attacks. 
Hosseini describes Afghanistan as a 
country filled with culture and 
ancient beauty. With the help of 
the narrator's love for his home, 
Afghanistan becomes a place the 
reader grows to love as well .

at the half, but had scoring troubles 
for the entirety of the game. 
UCSD averaged .406 in field goals 
for the game and .650 in free 
throws. • Review the list of employers 

UCSD was led offensively by 
four double-digit scoring players. 
Johnson had 22 poin ts, 13 
rebounds and rhree steals, while 
Gallagher-Bolton managed 13 
points, eight rebounds and three 

The Tritons, usually very 
strong in long-distance shooting, 
were unsuccessful in three-point 
shots, making only one of 12 
attempts. UCSD's difficulty 
beyond the arc proved to be a 
strong factor in their first loss in 
CCAA league play.

and pulled down four defensive boards in the Tritons' Jan. 7 overtime win. 

By JOE TEVELOWm 
Staff Writer 

After a dramatic 71-70 over-
time victory over Cal State 
Stanislaus gave the U CSD men's 
basketball team its first winning 
streak of the season on Jan. 7, a 
horrid shooting night against 
Chico State ended that streak. 
The Tritons now find themselves 
5-5 overall and 2-2 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play. 

After giving up a five-point 
lead in the final two minutes at 
Warrior Arena to allow the Cal 
State Stanislaus to force overtime, 
the Tritons got to the line Dn two 
separate occasions in the final 
minute, with junior guard/forward 
David Retzlaff providing the win-
ning margin after converting one 
of two from the line with five sec-
onds left. 

A three-point attempt by 
Warrior sophomore Marcus 
Martinez bounced off the rim as 
the game ended. 

UCSD had double-digit scor-
ing from four players, including 
Retzlaff and freshman guard Clint 
Allard, who paced the team with 
14 each, and freshman guard 
Andrew Hatch, who put in 13 
while coUecting a game-high nine 
rebounds and recording two 
steals. 

Sophomore forward Parker 
Berling fiUed up a stat line with 
nine points, seven rebounds, two 
steals and a game-high two 
blocks. 

Junior forward Kaving Young 
led the Warriors, scoring a 
game-high 21 points on 9-of- 14 
shooting from the field . Junior 
guard Jesse Satterfield added 14 
points on 4-of-7 shooting and 

.junior forward Joel Stallworth 
came off the bench to give six 
points and seven rebounds in 11 
minutes. 

Cal Sure Stanislaus senior Rick 

Fretter had 11 points, sinking 2-
of-5 three-point attempts, includ-
ing the long-range shot with three 
seconds left that sent the game 
into overtime. 

T he Tritons persevered due in 
large part to a .510 field goal per-
centage and a .444 percentage 
from behind the three-point arc. 

The Warriors, still winless in 
CCAA play, shot a dismal .410 
from the field and a frustrating 
.214 from three-point range. 

The Tritons were the ones suf-
fering from poor shooting on the 
evening of Jan. 8 when they fell, 
80-54, to Chico State at Acker 
Gymnasium. 

The Wildcats went on a 17-4 
run in the first half to push the 
score to 25- 12 . The Tritons 
refused to go down early, climb-
ing at one point to within six, 
before heading into halftime 
down nine. 

However, the Wildcats, who 
forced 21 turnovers and outre-
bounded the Tritons, 39-28, 
clamped down in the second half, 
allowing only one field goal 
through the first 13 minutes of the 
second half as they built a 25-point 
lead that the Tritons could never 
significantly dent. 

Chico State was led by 15 
points each from senior guard 
Scott Land and reserve senior 
guard Colin Carr, who connected 
on 4-of-8 three-point attempts 
coming off the bench. Senior 
point guard Tim Haley was solid, 
handing out nine assists to go 
with his seven rebounds and four 
steals. 

Reserve senior center. Will 
Bonner was the only other 
Wildcat in double-digits, scoring 
10 points and collecting a game~ 
high nine rebounds. 

Freshman guard Clint Allard 
and sophomore forward Chris 
Randall were the only Tritons in

The UCSD women's basketball 
team will return to action in San 
Diego for its next two games fol-
lowing a tough road trip in 
Northern California on Jan. 7 and 
Jan. 8. During the trip, the Tritons 
split their garnes, beating Cal State 
Stanislaus and falling to Chico 
State, putting the team's record at 
7-3 overall and 3-1 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play. 

The Tritons topped Cal State 
Stanislaus at Warrior Arena for 
their third straight win in CCAA 
action, beating the Warriors, 76-
65. 

The Tritons led by two points in 
the first half with a 31 -29 lead. 
UCSD had some difficulties hitting 
its field goals and long distance 
shooting attempts in the first half, 
but improved dramatically in the 
second half, raising its field-goal 
percentage from .325 to .500 and 
three-point attempts from 0-for-7 
in the first half to 4-for-5 in the 
second. 

Sophomore guard Leora Juster, 
the leading scorer for the Tritons, 
dropped a game-high 21 points. 
Senior center Margaret Johnson 
came through with 16 points, 
three assists and six blocks in the 
game. 

Junior guard Andrea Herold 
and senior center Stacey 
Gallagher-Bolton added 10 and six 
points, respectively, with 
Gallagher-Bolton collecting six

Tritons deliver against Berkeley, ·then drop straight sets to Lancers 
Defending NAIA champs stifle men's volleyball squad at regular season home opener 

By RAEL ENTIEN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD followed an easy exhibi-
tion win over Cal on Jan . 7 with a 
loss in straight sets to California 
Baptist on Jan. 8 at RIMAC Arena 
in the team's regular season opener. 

W ith the 3-0 loss to the 
Lancers, the Tritons fell to 0-1 on 
the season , while Cal Baptist 
improved to 2-0. The Tritons made 
every set close, with 30-23 , 30-22 
and 30-25 losses, but the Lancers 
dominated throughout. Three Cal 
Baptist players had double-digit kill 
stats, including junior Seidu 
Ajanako, who had 18 kills and 19 
points. 

Across the net, UCSD junior 
Luke Honnette hit .393 and led the 
Tritons with 13 kills and 14.5 
points. As a team, however, the 
Tritons were outhit, .442 to .124. 
The abysmal percentage was a huge 
factor in the Tritons' loss. 

Cal Baptist - which in 2004 
won its third National Association 
of Intercollegiate Athletics title in 
the program's six year existence -
outplayed the Tritons in every 
aspect of the game. UCSD was 
outblocked, 11 -6, and outlcilled, 
56-37. 

If these performances continue, 
the Tritons could be looking at 

another disappointing season. Last 
year, UCSD finished with an 8-21 
record and was far from a postsea-
son berth. 

While the straight-set loss was 
not what the Tritons were looking 
for, several UCSD athletes played 
exceptional games. 

In addition to Honnette's 
impressive stats, junior Adam 
Rusch had seven kills and fresh-
man Mike Reuter contributed five. 
Also, junior Nate Jones tallied 18 
assists and freshman Brooks 
Dierdorff helped out with 17 
assists. Both Jones and Dierdorff 
are Triton setters and shared time 
in the game. 

The Lancers had their fair share 
of stars, too, as senior Shaun Dyk 
and sophomore Shamsu Awudu 
shone with 14 and 11 kills, respec-
tively. Meanwhile, the Lancer set-
ter, senior Trevor Johnson, 
upstaged the Jones-Dierdorff duo 
with 49 assists. 

Despite the team's disappoint-
ing performance against Cal 
Baptist, the game against Berkeley 
painted a far different picture. 

The Tritons annihilated the 
Bears in three straight sets, 30-15, 
30-24 and 30-23, providing fans 
with a hopeful oudook for the reg-
uJar season. 

The Thtons' dominance was 

obvious throughout the game as 
they outhit their opponents, .457-
.366, more than three rimes better 
than their performance against Cal 
Baptist. 

Honnette was the star for the 
Tritons again with 12 kills and a 
.526 hitting percentage. Rusch 
helped out with seven kills and a 
superb .875 attack percentage. 

Redshirt John Mark Wendler, 
freshman Russ Hardy and Reuter 
had five kills each. As a team, 
UCSD outblocked Berkeley, 14.5-
0, with Wendler, Honnette and 
Reuter shutting Cal down four 
times each. 

The Jones-Dierdorff team 
worked well in the match, with 
Jones playing games one and three 
and Dierdorff setting in game two. 
lones had 23 assists and Dierdorff 
had 11 in his one game. 

Cal played well during parts of 
the match, especiaUy games two 
and three. Jeff Sause led the Bears 
with 11 lrills while teammate Kris 
Kuchenbecker was close behind 
with 10 kills. 

Although the Tritons would 
prefer to remember the Cal game 
and forget the match against the 
Lancers, the exhibition win means 
nothing, . while the 1055 to Cal AnIhw Mo,ICiuantan
