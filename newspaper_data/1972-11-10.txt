Tenured Professor Suspended for Alleged Aggression 
Reinhard Lettau, a tenured UCSD professor, was 

served a 14 day suspension notice for his alleged 
striking of Captain Watson, a marine recruiter, at an 
Open Forum on the Muir Free Speech Area, Tuesday 
afternoon. 

Lettau met with Chancellor McElroy and Dr. Andrew 
Wright, head of the literature department, yesterday 
morning. McElroy stated he approved of Murphy's 
action but that he felt the incident should have been 
held through university enforcement, not through the 
Cali fornia State Penal Code. 

Lettau's suspension was reduced to 24 hours under 
the condition that he answer the formal complaints 
before the Academic Senate. 

McElroy stated that if Lettau acknowledges the sub-
sta ntial accuracy of the complaints, a five day suspen-
sion from campus will be levied against Lettau, during 
which time he will neither be allowed to teach Hs 
classes nor receive salary. 

A group of UCSD's Professors have prepared an open 
letter of support for Professor Lettau, and further, 
charged the UCSD administration with "attempting" to 
intimidate a member of the facu:ty, by withdrawing 
Lettau's right to due process." (see page two). 

Vice Chancellor Murphy issued the initial suspension 
notice, authorized by Chancellor McElroy after formal 
complaints were submitted by Muir College Dean 
Beckley, Assistant Muir College Dean Fred D. Hender-
son, Jr., Muir Resident Dean Cleo Malone, and Assistant 
Revelle Resident Dean Rick Bayer. 

Two of the formal protestors of the Lettau action, 
Assistant Revelle Resident Dean Rick Bayer and Muir 
Dean Jim Bekeley although present at the time of the 

alleged incident, stated they did not personally witness 
it. 

These two complaints were used as evidence which 
culminated in Lettau's suspension. 

The incident was described by Bayer who did not 
witness it as "one in which Prof. Lettau walked past four 
Marine recruiters, who were answering questions 
during the rally and struck Captain Watson, one of the 
recruiters, with what appeared to be a 'Disorientation 
Manual'." 

" Although I did not personally see Professor Lettau 
hit Capt. Watson with the rolled paper, I was informed 
by 10-12 people who did see it, that it had occurred," 
stated Muir Dean Beckley. 

Beckley further stated "1 consider his (Lettau's) 
behavior to have been inflammatory and an infringe-
ment of university policy regarding physical abuse ,)f 
a r,erson on campus under an approved activity."

Preventing Theft: 
ClCopyright 

1972 all rights reserved 
Rick Drom 

Students are literally 
being ripped off almost 
every day at UCSD. In the 
month of Oct . alone , 
thieves sto le over $3,800 
worth of property. Many of 
these crimes could have 
been prevented. 

Unfo rtunately most 
students don't realize the 
magnitude of this problem. 
Usually the first time that 
they hear about a theft or 
burglary is when they are 
the victi m. 

For example, there were 
five burg laries last month. 
In each one the thief did-
n't even have to open one 
lock. They simply walked 
in to a suite and walked out 
with what they wanted . 

The procedure is usually 
almost the same. A person 
will leave his door unlock-
ed for a few moments while 
he goes into the bath-
room. When he comes out 
hiS wallet i gone. Some-
one leaves her door un-
locked when she goes to 
dinner. When she returns 
her purse is missing. 

The situation is similar 
wi th respect to bicycles. 
One is left unattended and 
un locked for a few minutes 
dnd it is never seen again . 
Last year 34 bikes were 
sto l n in the month of April 
alone at UCSD. Sometimes 
the thieves will even use 
boltcutters to get a valuable 
bike. 

Who is responsible? The 
answer to that question is 
not clear. Of 37 robberies 
that were reported last 
month, three suspects were 
arrested. All three were 
non-stud nts. But in the 
pa t students have been im-
pl!ca ted in many of the 
Cri mes. 
. ~o.wever, the respon -
~Ib lhty . for preventing 

How not to get ripp doff 
crimes clearly rests with 
everyone at UCSD. Many of 
the crimes, according to the 
campus police, are a result 
of apathy. 

Many students just don't 
want to get involved. 
Though they may see a 

453-2671 . Their office is 
located on Matthews cam-
pus on the corner of 
Meyers Drive and Miramar 
Road. 

Identification is the se-
cond key to preventing 
crimes. A local fence 

Students should then get 
an Operation Identifica-
tion sticker from the police 
to put on their door or 
window. It tells everyone 
that all the property inside 
has already been marked. If 
stolen, the property would 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

suspiciou character in their 
sui te they ignore him. Few 
report such an occurance 
to an R.A. or a resident 
dean until it is too late and 
they have already been 
robbed . Some don't even 
report a crime after it 
happens. Clearly the cam-
pus police can't recover 
property or apprehend 
thieves unless students 
report the theft . 

Communication with 
campus police is vital if our 
crime rate is to be halted . 
The police need informa-
tion not only about where 
crimes ar committed, but 
how. In addition they are 
always willing to h Ip in an 
em rgency. If stud nts ever 
feel threatened or 
suspicious the police urge 
th m to play it safe and 
alert them. The campus 
police an be reach d 24-
hours a day at 1333 or at 

q)l'e ~ ffoined . .. 

OPERITIOI 
IDEITIFICATIO 

All Items of value on these 
premises have been marked for 
ready identification by law 
Enforcement Agencies. 

------- ..... , .----

. recently admitted in court 
that if the property that he 
had handled had been 
properly marked he could 
have never sold it. 

This is the whole key to 
Operation Identification. A 
piece of property with a 
drivers license number or a 
social secu rity number is of 
little use to a thief. Recently 
a nation-wide campaign has 
begun to identify all 
valuables with an engraving 
p n to prevent robberies . 

The campus police are a 
part of thi program. They 
have four etching tool in 
their office which students 
can use to positively iden-
tify their valuables . 
Suggested item include 
bicycles , binoculars , 
cam ras, j welery, musical 
instrum nt , stereo , tape 
d ck , slid rulers ... in 
hort , any thin that has 

valu . 

have little or no re ale 
value. 

This step alone will not 
prevent robberie from oc-
curing at UC D, but it will 
cut down on the amount of 
crime. Last year it was es-
timated that UC D lost over 
$50,000 worth of property. 
One officer sugge ted that 
if Operation Identification 
became widespread and 
tudents communicated 

better with officer , crime 
at UC D could be cut in 
half within ix month . 

All it take i a little om-
mon nse and are to avert 
possible tragedy . October 
crim tati tics howed 
without a doubt that UC D 
ha it hare of crime. But 
tati ti how that a the 

year progre e~ rim g t 
ev n heavier. By pring th 
crim rat I u uall 0 high 
that October will look like a 
good month . 

By the suspension notice (Lettau was informed!. if he 
returned on campus within l~ days withou t specific 
consent of Vice Chancellor Murphy, h" could be 
"found guilty of a violation of section 6264 of thp Penal 
Code of the State of California." 

Dean Beckley stated Lettau was served the suspension 
notice because "Professor Lettau's action was viewed as 
potentially inflamatory (sic) and could have caused 
quick escalation in a situation which would have b en 
difficult to controL" 

"1 wanted students to understand that it was not just 
young people who would be held responsible for 
actions which constituted a violation of University 
policy", added Beckley. 

Having 'John Doe' suspension notices in his posses-
sion Tuesday morning, Dean Beckley stated, "The 
purpose of the suspension notices were to provide an 
alternative to calling campus police in to stop actions 
which consittute violation of University policy." 

Lettau was cited under California State Penal Code 
Section 62.6.4. 

According to Beckley the procedure for halting 
disruptive action was: 1) to verbally inform students If a 
violation was made, suspension notices would be 
served. 2) when a violation occurred the offender 
would be verbally notified to cease the activity. 3) If the 
violation was continued, the individual would be served 
with the suspension notice. 4) If the action was not 
halted at this time, the campus police would be called 
in to restore order. 

This procedure was not applied In Lettau's case,

Professor Bruce Franklin, author of works on H rman 
Melville, science fiction, and on the radical movement 
wiil be speaking on thi s cam pus Friday afternoon: 
Professor Franklin was formerly an As~uciate Professor 
of English at Stanford University, but was suspended 
from the faculty for allegedly inciting students to 
violence in the winter of 1971 . Although he is a 
respected scholar, was a tenured faculty member, and 
denies having incited anyone to violence he was 

eve~tually .dism is~ed permanently fr~m the facult y. 
HIS dismissal reveals to Professor Franklin " ... Stan-

ford . Uni.versity's barely concealed willingness to 
~acnflce liS professed basic principles of academic 
freedom, ... , and even reason itsel f in its eagerness to 
restore the law and order necessary to resume its 
business as usual in Southeast Asia and in the com-
munities that surround the university." Professor 
Frankl in will be spE'aking on " Literature, ociety and 
Politics" Friday, ov. 10 at 4 p.m. in 2A 2113. 

Magician to Appear 
The great Houdini's famous metamorphosis tri ck will 

be performed this Saturday in the Revelle cafE'teria. 
Stan Greene, a magician from Los Angeles , has 
promised to perform this as well as many other acts of 
magic at UCSD. 

Greene is now a coil ge student at UCLA, but he has 
be ~ interested in th art of magic for the past 12 years. 
H IS one of the youngest members of the ociety of 
Amencan Magicians, as well as a member of th Magic 
Castle. The latter is an exclusivE' magicians-only-club in 
Hollywood. 

One of the high-lights of the show will be Houdini 's 
metamorphosl trick . A huge crate will be brought on 
sta ge and examined by the audience. An assistant will 
be handcuffed and locked in thE' crate with 4 padlocks, 
as well as I ather straps GreE'ne will then hold up a 
curtain so thdt only hb head will be E'xposed . 

Greene will count to thrE'e and disappear Within 
those threE' seconds his assistant will replacE' him 
behind the curtain The crate will then be unlocked and 
there will be thE' magician, sitting in the crate hand-
cuffed 

This trick is billE'd as one of the hardest ever per-
forml'd bpcause It must happen so quickly. Greene will 
do this and othE'r acts of magic. Some of them will be a 
guillotlnp trick ; the famous "Chinese ring" trick ; some 
ca rd stunts; an ESP display and possibly an act of 
lE'vitation 

GreenE' is being sponso red by the Revelle GUE'st in 
ReSidencE' Committe . He promises to provide an 
E'vening of prestidigitation and surprises. Show times 
will be at 8 p.m. in the Revelle cafeteria. Admission IS 
free and all are welcoml'

Alleged Aggression 
continued from page 1 

" On the whole," stated Beckley, " the ind ividuals 
involved behaved in an acceptable manner." 

"Professor Lettau ca me around the students (ap-
p~oximately .200~ from west to east and walked past me 
With a book In hiS hand (the Disorientation Manual) and 
walked behind the 4 Marine recruiters . We walked past 
2 of the men (recrui ters) and as he passed the 3rd one 
he reached out and hit h im on the head with the book," 
stated Cleo Malone, Muir Resident Dean in the formal 
complaint. 

" I attended the rally today at Muir College and 
observed Professor Lettau strike Capt. Watson on the 
head with a rolled piece of paper," stated Fred D. 
Henderson Jr. 

In Each of the formal complaints it was also stated that 
they had heard Lettau speak, directly after the incident, 
sta ting "he was not sorry" he had tapped the Recruiter 
upon th hat. 
. Maxine Bailey: head of Career Plann ing, and respon-

Sible fo~ schedu ling the recruiters on ca mpus stated, "In 
the Spring of 1969, a student referendum was held in 
which 6p/o voted to maintain open recruiting on 

camp~s and 28% opposed maintaining a policy of oppn 
recruitment." 

Re: Reinhard Lettau 
Following is a letter to the Chancellor and the head of 
the Academic Senate. It reflects the views of the 
undersigned. 
To: William McElroy, Chancellor; William M enard, 
Chairman, Academic Senate. 

On Tuesday Morning, Nov. 7, four Marine Corps 
R crulters were spea king with students at a noon rally 
in front of Muir commons. Reinhard Lettau , of the 
literature Department, passing by on his way to a 
meeting, tapped the hat of one of the Marines with a 
copy of the Triton Times. After add ressi ng the crowd 
briefly, he went on to his meeting. 

In the evening Lettau was served with a suspension 
notice by two campus policemen who appeared at his 
home. The notice, served by the UCSD administration, 
stated that Lettau had acted in an inflammatory manner 
and that consent for him to be on University property 
had been withdrawn for a period of two week s. 
(Wednesday morning the suspension was reduced to 
five days, with correspond ing loss of pay). Further, it 
stated that if Lettau does set foot on the University 
during that period, legal action will be taken against 
him. 

We are ou lraged at the ease with which the ad-
ministration can undermine the basic principles of due 
process . To suspend a professor without giving him the 
least hearing, without allowing him the slightest 
response to the charges, without letting him utilize the 
institutions of self-defense which the Academi enate 
of the University provides for litigation of controversy, 
and Without giving his action the chance to be judged 
by hiS faculty pePrs, these separately and tog ther 
comprise an administrative response momentous in its 
repressive implications. 

We protest this outrage, and insist the suspension 
order be revoked immediately. We furthermore insist 
the administration apologize to Lettau , and that it take 
whatevPr it thinks its case against Lettau may be through 
thl' proper channe ls of the Academic ena te. And 
finally we insist that the Academic Senate warn the 
University administration to recall that t ile University 
administration exists to serve the faculty and the 
students. 

In its action against Lettau that administration has 
ceased to be a servant of the University and has 
attempted to Intimidate a member of th farulty . Su h 
withdrawal of the rights of due process constitutes an 
act of intimidation directed not only against L ttau but 
against the entire academic community. Such intimid a-
tion cannOI b allowed .

This w ek I decided to piay it safe and writ'! e~­
clusive ly about student activities . Yet where to begin? 
You all do so much. So, after rejecting the idea of 
reporting on the clubs, or Cal -PIRG, or cafeteria gossip 
I decided to write a basic, run-of-the-mill article on se; 
on campus. " No one will be interested ," said the 
editors. In hopes of ma.king the column more exciting,l 
have narrowed the tOpiC down to the sex ual activities of 
certain groups and people on campus. 

The first of these people is a man they ca ll "EI Lobo" 
One ca n f ind him at any hour, day or night, following 
Frosh women (he went to Rocky and lea rned how to tl''' 
the difference) across the Plaza, through Muir Com-
mons, into the bookstore, on the sands at Blacks, and 
even into the thick, dense forest surrounding UCSD. He 
waits in the shadows between Urey Ha" and Blake or 
under the stairs At Challenger. When a girl finally w~lks 
by, EI Lobo, hot on the scent , drapes his cloak Over 

hunch~d should.ers, twitt-hes ~is eyes, turns his eyes, 
turns hiS head, fIr st left, then right, then slides into the 
murky fog in hopes of asking her to the next Friday 
night dance (which will be in May . EI Lobo means no 
haim. He just likp\ to look at dll the pretty gi rls. Do nOI 
be afraid . 

" Fifth floor " Argo also deserves a special mention for 
their attempt to rel ive that fine soap opera, "Edge of 
Night. " It is precisely at the edge of night when the 
a~t o rs and act.resses take their places. " Jim, you sleep 
With Mary tonight and George, you go with Martha. Or 
is it Martha with jim and Mary with George? Mary with 
Martha and Jim with George? Oh, never mind . The 
couple who gets to the water bed first will decide with 
whom the rest of us wi" sleep. 

I in terviewed BR, the socia l director on the fifth floor. 
"Te" me, BR, what is the average turnover betw ('n 

partners on your floor?" 
"We", Joni, it all depends on several factors. The first 

is a flat requirement that no two people are coupled 
together for more than three nights in a row. To make 
su re that there is no cheating, those caught together on 
the forth nighl are not allowed to use the water bed for 
two weeks . I know the pena lty is tough, but yo u've got 
to be tough to stay in this game. Happil y, the three-
night quota has given us no problems so far. In fact , one 
girl complained that it was too much. Another factor is 
directly related to the internal energy th ory, whi ch 
states that the diminishing o f energy equals heat minus 
work done. When apf.l lied to the turnover ratio, it 
means that most people simply do not have the energy 
to keep up our pace. Our regu lars ge t one night a week 
off, but the turnover of the less dedicated is quite hig h. 
They simply cannot participate on even a three-times-a-
week level. 

Another pc'son who is quite knowledgable about sex 
on campus is Sta nley S. Stanles, an Apis major at Revelle 
who is studYing the psychological behav ior isms of 
groups at the class level. "One very distinct difference 
between the freshmen guys and the sophomore can be 
dernonstrated quite distinctly by their attendance at the 
Friday nighl movie", con fided Stanley . "The freshm en 
go in groups of eigh t and come out with the same 
group. The sophomores, however, begin to go coed. 
Their groups of eight consist of four guys and four gals. 
By the Junior year, no two people stay toget her dur ing 
the entire movie. Seniors rarely both er with Ihe movies 
at all." 

Proper technique is also quite important in formin g 
relationships. Dav , who has read every book concer-
ning techn ique on the market, has syn thesized the 
material into his own philosophy which he formed as a 
student at UCSD. 

"Formal dating is ou t, man. The sauna, the TV room, 
the lounge, and th cliffs are a good place to take a girl, 
and its a" free, too. The girls, though, aren't dumb. They 
know that a" this stuff ain'l costin ' ya any coins, so once 
in a while a movie is good just to show her that you ain't 
afraid to spe nd big." 

Dave assured me that these sly methods, as well as the 
others he uses when he goes off campus, Me 
guaranteed to work . 

Unfortunately, I do not have enough space to men· 
tion all the wonderful sex-rela ted activi ties going on dl 
thiS very minute at UCSD. Even though I tri ed to n~rrow 
down the topic to certain specifi cs, I am su re that th ere 
are those who feel slighted, and frustrated that they 
were not mentioned. If this is the case, may I suggest re-
read the uote Dave?

Israel: A History Re-Written 
Jack Sage 

In the Nov. 3, 1972, issue of TRITON 
TIMES Harry Ruja, a member of the 
Department of Philosophy and the 
Jewish Studies Department at Cal State 
University, San Diego, presented a fine 
il lustration of Zionist ideology and 
technique. We are very fortunate to read 
Mr. Ru ja, who spendidly represents the 
Zionist movement in all its various dis-
gu ises, Re-writing history comes very 
easy to Mr. Ruja and his fellow Zionists, 
and it is for this reason that by carefully 
studying the Ruja-Zionist technique, we 
can gain a clearer understanding of the 
Israel problem, 

Ruja presents three concepts basic to 
Zionist ideology, It is in his second argu-
ment of the "happy relationship" 
between "Arabs and Jews" during the 
early settlement of Palestine by the 
Zionists, that Zionist Ru ju literally alters 
his own Zionist source material to add 
further evidence to his position!! Is it 
possible for a university professor, such 
as Mr. Ruja, to become so hysterically 
involved that he would stoop to such a 
low-caliber stunt as rewriting a pur-
ported quote? Also, I must ask: can the 
TRITON TIMES allow itself to be used by 
a university professor, by printing a so-
called "reply" to a controversial issue, 
which purports to reliably quote infor-
mation, which upon inspection turns out 
to be blatantly altered by the author 
Ruja!! 

Here is how Ruja proves the "happy 
relationship" thesis. In describing the 
massive influx of Jews into Palestine from 
Europe Ruja quotes, "The Arab popula-
tion and its prosperity both showed an 
unparalleled expansion ," In reality this is 
on Iy a fragment of the original authentic 
whole sentence which reads, 
"Moreover, while Arab anger and 
violence incrl'ased catastrophically 
during the same period, the Arab pop-
ulation and its prosperity both showed 
an unparalleled expansion which, but for 
strikes and violence, would have been 
even greater." (Rujas' own source, 
Parkes, Whose Land pg. 270) Notice how 
Ruja incorrectly quotes Parkes (the un-
derlined is the Ruja version of the quote) 
not only out of context, but actually 
revises the grammar to make his point. 
Obviously Rujas' " happy relationship" 
thesis i., Incompatible with the reality of 
"Arab anger dnd violence increased 
ca tastroph ically," and the "strikes and 
violence" to which Parkes refers . Whose 
thesis IS full of " errors" and " downright 
fabrications" as Zionist Ruja accuses? The 
TRITON TIMES sh ould demand an 
apology from Mr, Ruja. 

Attempting to prove that the Balfour 
Declaration possessed some legal 
character, Ruja accuses me of presenting 
undocumentable material. In fact , I 
repeat , the Balfour Declaration was il-
legal and undemocratic, simply giving 
away the sovereignty of the Palestinian 
people. Lord Balfour admitted this: "The 
four great powers are committed to 
Zionism. And Zionism, be it right or 
wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-
long traditions, in present needs, in 
future hopes, of far profounder import 
than the desires and prejudices of the 
700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that an-
cient land," (Source: Documents on 
British Foreign Policy 1919-1939, ed, E.L. 
Woodward and Rohan Butler. First Series 

IV (London, 1952), 345,) 
Next Ruja accuses that it is "pure 

invention" to portray the First Zionist 
Congress of 1897 as a co lonial move-
ment. Here the uniformed Ruja cites a 
fragment of the platform to substantiate 
his point. Apparently, Ruja must not read 
his own preferred Zionist hi stor ian 
Parkes, who tells us that the means to 
achieve a Jewish home in Palestine were 
clea rly spelled out in the Zionist 
program: " The promotion on suitable 
lines, of the colonization of Palestine by 
Jewish agricultural and indu stri al 
workers." (Parkes, A History of Palestine, 
p. 271.) A few years later David Ben-
Gurion, a more modern-day proponent 
of Zionism, admitted, " We were not just 
working - we were conquering, con-
quering a land. We were a company of 
conquistadors ... " (Source: D . Ben-
Gurion, Rebirth and Destiny of Israel, p. 
9.) To the heroin addict there is no 
greater pleasure than a big syringe of 
smack. And to the Zionist Ruja there is 
no greater achievement than Israeli ex-
pansion and occupation. listen to this 
Ruja fantasy: " This same happy 
relationship within the State of Israel 
between Arabs and Jews continues today 
where the Arabs who are now under 
Israeli administration have had their lives 
transformed: health, income, education, 
culture - all the amenities of a civilized 
life have been enhanced." Is this not the 
identical argument which every 
aggressor and colonizer has used to 
justify plunder and expansion? Is it not 
true that President Johnson told us the 
same thing in 1964, claiming it was the 
Vietnamese people who called for U.S, 
intervention? 

Zionist propagandists have 
characterized the Israel 1967 occupation 
as benevolent and civilizing. Is it a "hap-
py relationship" which has created a 
situation which the LONDON TIMES 
foreign editor described as a "mood 
similar to that in occupied "France (by the 
Nazis) at the beginning of 1942"? 
Moreover, he noted that "the Israelis are 
hated everywhere by all Sl'ctions of the 
population" (LONDON TIMES Oct. 28, 
1969). 

In January 1971 the Israel League for 
Human and Civil Right published an 
appeal entitled "The Horrors of Gaza 
Must Cease." (The Gaza strip is a piece of 
Palestine occupied by I rael in 1967.) This 
dPpeal included the following : 
' Thousands of people are 

detained ... horrible cries are heard for 
hours on hours from the place, which is 
out of bounds even for Israeli soldiers .. ,a 
concentration camp for families of 
'wanted persons' was opened in the 
central Sinai Desert and this camp is 
being speedily enlarged. Women and 
children, whose only crime is that they 
are relatives of wanted persons are con-
fined in this desert place." (Israel League 
for Human and Civil Rights, Tel Aviv, 
POB 20178). To meet the resistance of the 
occupied Palestinians, Moshe Dayan 
developed the policy of neighborhood 
punishment. "Today we are not only 
punishing individuals who commit 
crimes, but also those around them." 
(WASHI NGTON POST, Nov. 13, 1969). 

Has there ever been a "happy 
relationship," as Mr. Ruia describes it,

Beck Resignation Demanded 
~OInl • • rnl.ti Students of UCSD (names withheld by request) 

An incident has our cam pus wllich 
demands our imrne(ji~lion . 

On Tuesday, Nov. 7 held at Muir College 
to protest Marine our campus. This rally 
was an open forum between the Marine 
recruiters and the one point during the 
rally, Professor walking behind the 
four Marine one of them on 
the cap with a rolled Lettau was 
criticized by some the audience for his 
action and several he made a public 
explanation , 

On this same

Professor Lettau was

accusers. He was chJrges against him dt 
the same time that ded, As such, he was

Professor Lettau reee inJ; whatsoever. The 
administration Profess or Lettau's 
" , .. behavior to inflammatory and an 

infringement of University policy regarding physical 
abuse of any person on campus under an approved 
activity" (Letter of Dean James A. Beckley to Vice-
Chancellor and Dean of Student Affairs George S. 
Murphy, dated Nov. 7, 1972). The inflammatory 
response of the students at the rally consisted of 
applause. The Marine captain who was tapped on the 
head is not going to press charges. Thus, it is the 
administration that has initiated this action . 

In particular, the dean of Muir College, James A. 
Beckley, must be held responsible for the actions of the 
administration . He was the acting representative of 
Vice-Chancellor Murphy and Chancellor MCElroy, To 
quote again from his letter, "Because his behavior has 
been publicly acknowledged and can be attested to by 
a sizable number of witnesses, I request that ap-
propriate action be taken" (James A. Beckley, Nov, 7, 
1972). In light of the moderate response of the students 
at .the rally to Professor Lettau's behavior, one must 
necessarily view Dean Beckley's action as unwarranted; 
an overreaction and a misuse of authority. He has 
abused his responsibility as a liaison between the 
students and the administration. Through his actions he 
has imposed his personal political view and bias on this 
incident. The fact that Dean Beckley failed to give 
Professor Lettau any warning at all before issuing him a 
notice of suspension is proof of Dean Beckley's 
irresponsibility and his incompetency. 

We therefore demand that Dean James A. Beckley 
resign as dean of Muir College. By his misuse of 
authority, his irrational response to what was no more 
than a trivial incident, h has shown himself to be an 
incompetent admini trator 

Jingoi ditorial Bias of the Copley Press 
Editor : 

I am responding rllde on the Copley 
Press by sending you letter I sent to the San 
Diego UNION this nformation contained 
in the letter is indi of the more "subtle" 
tactics used by the fhe letter was not 
printed by the U rpover, it failed to 
acknowledge re(:eil'lfIII(ue tha t they maintain 
space limitations, fou nd that in such 
situations other tl' that your letter 
will be printed if it is eless, I failed to 
get any response f I hope you will find 
space to print the h the paragraph de-
leted from Kraft's 

Usually, hnwpvpr is not "subtle" at all. 
For example, rp~rl,,"'~ION may recall that 
when McGovern speech on Vietnam, 
the UNION relega 7-A. The L.A. TIMES, 
which is a pro-Nixon willing to give it 
headline coverage. I of ov. 2, 1972, there 
was a fron t-page ith the imbecilic Billy 
Graham's claim that of princip le" and 
"integrity." Is this ganda ploy de-
signed to appeal to ind ividuals who 
equate right-wing Chris tian funda-
mentalism? I can raham's ego was not 
displayed on the L.A. TIMES. 

But 'these are hough it is hard to 
document this, I done by the 
UNION consists in coverage of events 
of long-range impo not support their 
view of the world, one relied on th 
UNION, one view of the 
si tuation in hile, ruggle in Portugal's 
colonies in Africa, rmountable difficu l-
ties facing the mil in Cambodia , Per-
haps Moser could to researching such 
matters. 

But what is of pa ce is to realize that 
the vast majority of this country are 
as bad- if not This claim i 
based on personal that I have lived in 
some of America '~ is ludicrous for the 
Nixon Administrat the Am rican Press. 
Th yare actually ne, The New York 
Review of Books, mes, the Washington 

Po st, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, perhaps 
the Boston Globe and at best a few others. And, fur· 
thermore, with the possible exception of the first two, 
does anyone really think that these ar.:! a danger to the 
"American way of life"? As for the so-called "under-
ground" press and the papers of the "radical" left, I am 
convinced that the intellecruallevel tends to be so low 
that they scarcely help. I assure you that this is a con· 
sidered judgment based on an extensive sample taken 
from all over the country for at least the last seven years. 
In fine, the term "free press" as applied to American 

journalism is either a contradiction in terms or simply 
meaningless, 

Editors, THE UNION: 

Thank you, 
Jack M. Clontz 

Teaching Assistant 
Dept. of Philosopy

I think your readers deserve some explanation for the 
omission of a crucial paragraph from Joseph Kraft 's 
column " Bomb Damage Great in North Vietnam" (July 
24 on p. B-7) . According to the version of Kraft's column 
in the LOS ANGELES TIM ES the omitted paragraph runs 
as follows : 

I have seen bits of burned clothing hanging grotes-
quely from the remains of what were trees standing 
near bombed-out homes. I have seen pieces of what 
were human beings, including a charred lower jaw. I 
have een an old man standing in the ruins of his 
devastated home, mourning the loss of his wife, his only 
son and his grandson, and vowing, as he shook his fists 
to the heavens, that his heart would always be 
"hardened with hatr d" against the Americans. 

No doubt you will deny that this is censorship, but 
given the jingoistiC ditorial bias exhibited in your 
paper such denial ring hollow. Presumably, it was only 
for reasons of space that you aw fit to omit this 
paragraph in order to insert a singularly inane and 
puerile cartoon which onveni ntly took up almost the 
exact amount of space r quisit for thi omitted 
paragraph. 

Thank you, 
Jack M. Clontz

For Big Finale 

Starting out with a promising squad the Cross Coun-
try Team dwindled down to three hard-core harriers: 
Mike Bergkamp, Mike DeSosa and Chuck Crumley. The 
trio travels to Fresno-Pacific this weekend for the NAIA 
District III Championships, strictly in the hopes of 
gaining individual honors, as there are not enough 
runners to constitute a team. 

Competition at the meet should be pretty stiff with 
eight or ten schools sending teams. Occidental , West-
mont and cross-town rival USIU are the heavy favorites, 
though it should turn out to be a two-school race 
between Oxy and Westmont. The winning team , plus 
the top individuals, will be selected to compete in the 
Nationals, which this year will be run at William Joule 
College in Missouri later in the month. It is not likely 
that Mike Bergkamp, UCSD's top runner, will be 
selected to compete at the Nationals . However, Coach 
Sk ief expects him to finish in the top 25 . 

Andy Skief, understandably disappointed w ith the 
dwindling participation throughout the season, did 
comment on his frosh standouts : "I just kind of wish 
that the six runners that dropped out since the begin-
n ing would adopt the attitude toward cross country of 
Mike Bergkamp. He's the kind of athlete a coach would 
like to see comprise a whole team. Mike DeSosa is 
another who works hard and has an excellent attitude. 
Hopefully, th is spirit will carry over into track ." 

As a final note there will be a meeting fo r all 
individuals who are interested in track and field . The 
meeting will take place Fr iday evening, ov. 17 at 7 p.m. 
in the gym ch ss room. For more information contact 
Coach Skief at the PE Office.

Last Saturday, tho'se of 
you who were among the 
rowdy, banncr - wa ing 
crowd present to say 
farewell to H ot Rocks 
Stoner et ai, witnessed one 
of those rare and cherished 
moments in UCSD water 
polo history - a slaughter 
by the good guys. The stars 
had blessed the boys in 
blue .. . 

The opponert was Chap-
man, a team which the local 
squad beat in their second 
game of the season 13-9. 
That was way back when 
some of the frosh were just 
learning that the ball was 
for shooting, trunks were 
for pulling, and refs were 

Basketbal l 
Team 
Scrimmage 

The first home 
appearance of this year's 
exciting UCSD basketball 
team will happen today at 4 
p.m. in the gym. The Tritons 
will be scrimmaging against 
a quick contingent from 
Mesa )C in preparation for 
the upcoming Cal Western 
Tourn ament which takes 
p lace on Dec. 1 and 2. The 
round-bail ers have been 
practi cing for three weeks 
now and most veteran 
UC5D basketball observers 
agree that this could be the 
fin es t ball club ever 
ass embled in UCSD 's 
history. 

fair game for those one 
fingered waves when their 
backs were turned. So the 
game had a possib il ity of 
being close, but it wasn't. In 
fact, it wasn't even close to 
starting at 11 . The "contest" 
(to put it politely in accep-
table journalistic terms) 
began at high noon and 
ended on a high note, wi th 
a high score. 

By the end of the first 
quarter, the pace of the 
game had been set. Orr 
some hot shooting by 
Pickle, the blue boys were 
up 4-2. By the half, the 
doubled score had again 
been doubled, which if you 
can't figure that out, it 
means it was 8-4. By this 
time everybody in the place 
had realized that it would 
be a runaway. 

They also realized that 
the UCSD pool had been 
blessed by a celebrity, for 
one of the most famous 
advocates of justice in San 
Diego had dawned his 
stripes and warmed up his 
whistle. A foul, yet fitting 
tribute to the season finale. 
How nice it is to bring old 
friends together . . . Not to 
mention any names, but 
this guy classes his reffing as 

"Flash " Gordon kee p ing the b all fro m o pponent in 
recen t gam e. Photo : Easte rn 

this dapper Cheater- trapper 
helped shady Stoner to a 
new team record , throwing 
him out on a major foul 
(impeding a free throw, 
which had Prop. 18 passed, 
probably would have been 
made a felony in La Jolla) in 
less than 2 minutes. So, 
Stoner's last home game 
was standing on the 
sidelines, rather than in-
spiring the headlines. 

Back to reality, by the 
end of the third the score 
had multiplied to 13-7 with 
no particular offense, and 
sort of a "grab him if he's 
close defense", which, by 
the frequency of the 
whistles was evidently 
pushing our celebrity 
toward orgasm . By the 

fourth period the game was 
out-of-sight thanks to the 
gunning of Pickle and Pixie. 
Between the two potent 
"P's" 1 1 goals and 2 penalty 
shots were put into the blue 
target, adding to the final 
incredible result : UC5D 21 , 
Chapman 8. 

Records : Only the se-
cond highest score ever by 
UCSD. Last year it was 22 to 
4. Most admitted mistakes 
by a ref! after a game. 
Highlights : Flash , Lip, and 
"24" all with goose eggs, 
but lots of assists to gunners 
P and P, who are helpless 
on their own. Most errors 
in a game at the scorer's 
table. And no, Val didn't 
play, at least not during the 
game ...

cupiers have resorted to torture in orde, 
to exterminate the Palestinian resistance

interrogatjon rooms I heard prisoners 
shrieking and sobbing . Captur d 
terrorists mu st expect tortur , but it was 
horrible 10 hear." (life, April 13, 1968). 

It was no surprise then when Israel 
decided not to cooperate with any inter-
