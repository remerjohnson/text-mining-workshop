WASHINGTON - The U.S. 
Congress voted last Thursday 
to weaken portions of 
California's 1977 Clean Air 
Act, a stricter version of the 
1990 Clean Air Act Amend-
ments. Gov. Wilson had 
lobbied extensively to modify 
the laws, which he claimed 
threaftm'Cd 165,000 jobs and 
$17 billion in economic output 
by the year 2010. The Clinton 
Administration had drawn up a 
plan to keep California in 
compliance with the 1977 act, 
which provided more stringent 
guidelines for clean air 
regulations.

LOS ANGELES - Therapy 
for anxiety and mild depres-
sion may be conducted 
effectively through a computer 
question-and-answer program, 
according to data presented by 
UCLA psychologists. UCLA 
Professor Marion Jacobs 
claims patients responding to 
personal psychotherapy 
treatments and those respond-
ing to computerized questions 
about their symptoms were 
equally satisfied with the 
results. Although Jacobs does 
not recommend substituting 
computer therapy for personal 
care, she says, "it can be used 
as an adjunct to more tradi-
tional, ongoing psycho-
therapy." The study covered 
90 patients suffering from 
mild stress, anxiety or 
depression. Despite some 
success, both groups saw 
relapses in a follow-up study.

THE A.S. ELECTIONS ARE HERE AGAIN 
BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS - WILL 
ANYONE COME TO SEE THE SHOW? 

, 

OTER TIJRNOlJT HIT A HIGH-WATER MARK LAST YEAR - 13 PERCENT 
of the student body stormed the polls. D~spite attempts to 
trumpet the importance of A.S. politics - from noisy candi-
dates to large elections issues in this newspaper - most 
students remain unconvinced. The A.S. Council is widely 
perceived as being almost irrelevant to students' lives: at best, 

it is the purveyor of cool events such as the Sun God Festival; at worst, 
a high schoolish social club with no power. 

Such perceptions are largely wrong. Even a cursory view of student 
government reveals that the A.S. does, in fact, have the ability to affect 
the lives of students. This year, A.S. President Carla Tesak successfully 
spearheaded a drive to establish affordable housing on campus and the 
council pushed the administration to discontinue using Social Security 
numbers for identification. 

But as this year's crop of candidates shift their 
campaigns into high gear, it probably won't be 
their platforms and their "issues" which 
bring students to the polls. With three fee-
hike referenda on the ballot, the A.S. elec-
tions may witness record students at the polls, 
trying to protect the coveted dollar.

FreelllV/ 
AIDS Testing 
SERVICE: Partnership with 
local clinic makes anonymous 
testing available to students 
By Jonn. Palmer 
Senior Staff Writer 

In an effort to increase AIDS awareness and 
fight the spread of the deadly disease, the UCSD 
Student Health Center has begun offering free 
anonymous HIV testing. 

The free testing has been in great demand 
since it was introduced just prior to finals week 
last quarter, according to UCSD Health Educa-
tor Lupe Samaniego-Kraus. 

"We knew students wanted [free testing], but 
we weren't sure how much it would be utilized," 
Samaniego-Kraus said. 

While testing is officially available on a 
walk-in basis, students are now being encour-
aged to call ahead for appointments through the 
central scheduling department. Due to the ex-
tensive counseling required both before and 
after an HIV test, only six to eight people can be 
tested each day. 

According to Samaniego-Kraus, there is al-
ready a backlog of students waiting to be tested. 

Blood testing and pre- and post-test counsel-
ing are available on Tuesdays and Fridays from 
9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. 

The anonymous testing is possible because 
of a partnership between Student Health and the 
Beach Area Family Health Center, said 
Samaniego-Kraus. 

"It's our first step in doing a lot more com-
munity-type programs," he added. 

Previously, Student Health had charged $15 
for either an anonymous or a confidential test, 
because only community clinics are given the 
resources to set up free testing programs. 

"[UCSD is] not eligible for that type of 
funding," said Samaniego-Kraus. "UC River-
side, UC Irvine ... they're all trying to partner 
with other community clinics." 

Confidential test results are placed in a 
patient's permanent record, while anonymous 
testing procedures call for the use of initials only 
in the identification of patients. No permanent 
record of the patient's results are kept. 

Student Health continues to offer confiden-
tial testing for the $15 fee. Samaniego-Kraus 
said that confidential testing is necessary for

UCSA Forum Calls for Student Activism, Regent Support 
By Nady. Tan 
Guardian Reporter 

LOS ANGELES - Calling 
on the University of California 
to stop the door to higher educa-
tion from slamming on thousands 
of qualified students, the UC 
Students Association (UCSA) 
held its annual UC Student Sum-
mit at UCLA over the weekend. 

The two-day conference, at-
tended by 150 UC students, fo-
cused on "preserving access" to 
the university. With further fee 

hikes on the horizon and the fu-
ture of affirmative-action pro-
grams and subsidized student 
loans in question, students at the 
conference developed plans to 
involve UC students in the po-
litical process. 

"We are at a critical moment 
in the history of the University 
of Cali fomi a .... Students in Cali-
fornia are at the forefront of a 
struggle. Education is a right, 
not a privilege for a few," said 
UCLA student Sabrina Smith 

yesterday. 
According to UCSA Chair 

Andre Quintero, the conference 
also highlighted the 
reconfiguration of the UCSA's 
duties as a student lobbying or-
ganization in the wake of the 
Smith v. Regents Supreme Court 
decision, which bars the UCSA 
from lobbying the Legislature. 

"Though many battles were 
waged and tears shed, we en-
dured through the difficultie

UCSD Chemist Wins 
Smithsonian Honors 
AWARD: Andrew McCammon recognized for 
research combining computers and chemistry 
By Ben Ellln 
Associate News Editor 

Andrew McCammon, UCSO's 
chair in Theoretical Chemistry, has 
garnered 1995's Computerworld 
Smithsonian Breakthrough Compu-
tational Science Award for his math-
ematical explanation behind the 

work, involving the design of phar-
maceuticals to combat drug-resis-
tant strains of viruses and bacteria, 
is done through extensive collabo-
ration with the SDSC. 

"We're trying to mimic the be-

lightning-fast work-
ings of nerves and 
muscles. 

The scientific 
community has long 
been baffled by the 
speed in which an 
enzyme called ace-
ty Icholinesterase 
(AChE) breaks 
down its substrate, 
acetylcholine, to 
hall a muscle or 
nerve action. 

"The mystery 
was, how could 
AChE [breakdown) 
so much acetylcho-
line in so short a 
time?" said 
McCammon. "The 
entire reaction takes 
less than two milli-
seconds, an astound-
ing speed for a bio-
logical enzyme." 

Using a sophisti-
cated computer pro-
gram, McCammon 
and his associates 
were able to simu-
late the movement 
of thousands of 
AChE atoms and 
visualize the puzzle 
at a different level. 

They discovered 
that the atomic mo-
tion of AChE can 
widen the main 
nerve muscle path· 
way and open extra 
channels to increase 
the amount of ace-
tylcholine available 
for elimination.

"We make what is

Supercomputers 
at the SDSC give 
McCammon and his 
colleagues the abil-
ity to simulate 
atomic motion for

by the fundamenlal

used to predict the

and how they will

McCammon joined the UCSD 

faculty earlier this year, moving from

was a professor of chemistry and the 
director of the Institute for Molecu-
lar Design. 

McCammon was honored with 
the 1987 George Hitchings Award 
for Innovative Methods in Orug 
Design for his CUlling-edge achieve-
ments in computer-aided pharma-
ceutical design. 

He attributes the opportunity to 
work closely with colleagues in phar-
macology and the proximity of the 
San Diego Supercomputer Center 
(SDSC) as key factors behind his 
move to UCSO. 

"We are particularly pleased to

Free skirw:ancer tests will be held throughout May 
at the La Jolla office of Dr. Alex Peterson, as a part of 
the National Melanoma/Skin Cancer Detection and 
Prevention Month. 

The screeni~s are part of a national campaign to

United States. 

"Your chances of gettl~ skin cancer are one in 
Six," said Peterson. "Many people think of it as a 
disease of the elderly but we are seeing more and 
more skin cancers in younger people.· 

Citing suntanning as a major cause of sklrH:ancer, 
Peterson estimates that 10 to 20 years of accumu-
lated sun exposure can cause the disease. Prolonged 
exposure also Increases the risk of developing mela-
noma, a potentially deadly form of skin-cancer, Peterson

"(People) don't realize that suntanning is so un-

healthy," said Peterson. "They think of themselves as 
Immune to skin cancer.· 

Even though three-quarters of all skin cancers can 
be treated, one or more serious childhood or adoles-
cent sunbum can double the chances of getting skin 
cancer later in life.

Quintero wrote in a letter to con-

The highlight of the conference 
was a forum with UC Regent 
Velma Montoya, UC Provost and 
Senior Vice President Walter E. 
Massey, Student Regent Terrence 
Wooten and Student Regent-des. 
ignate Ed Gomez. Issues ranging 
from gay and lesbian student hous. 
ing to subsidized student loans were 
brought before the panel by audi-
ence members. 

The forum was, in part, an effort 
to open dialogue with and el icit 
support from the regents regarding 
student issues, according to orga· 
nizers. Among the largest of these 
concerns is the pending federal leg· 
islation to cut financial aid funding. 

"The proposed cuts to federal 
financial aid would be devastating 
to UC students," said UCSO 's 
UCSA Representative Naomi Falk. 
"We estimate that it will impact 
one out of four UC students." 

Massey agreed, saying, "We 
have to be very active on this issue. 
This is going to be one of the most 
devastating actions with respect to 
our ability to provide access [to the 
university]" 

Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed 
compaCt with the university, part of 
which would increases fees by 10 
percent fee every year for the next 
five years, was also discussed as a 
potential roadblock to accessibility. 

"The University of California

is ceasing to be a public university 
and is becoming an institution for 
the children of the rich," said 
American Federation of Teachers 
member Susan Griffin. 

Testimony from studenlS gave 
personal weight to Griffin's state-
ment. 

"My continued enrollment at 
Santa Cruz right now is tentative 
as far as the amount of money I am 
going to be receiving. And it is 
estimated that if I graduate in four 
years my loan debt will be $56,000. 
This is something that is basically 
unavoidable. My mom is a single 
parent and cannot afford to send 
me to college, "said UCSantaCruz 
student Amber Greenspan. 

Past President of the UCLA 
AsianlPacific Islander Alumni As-

sociation Dan Mayeda urged those in a 
position of power to take a cue from 
tomorrow's leaders, saying, "The time 
has come to say: 'Enough is enough. 
No more fee hikes.'" 

The UCSA also pledged to fight 
against attempts to dismantle affirma· 
tive·action programs. 

"Take a look at the universities and 
the jails. It seems to be that there's 
more access 10 jails than to the univer-
sities. Support affirmative action, "said 
Gomez. 

This is the first year that the UCSA 
has encouraged student input on ilS 
agenda items, according to FaJk. "[We 
needjto get a wide-based input and this 
is the first time this has happened," she 
said.

AIDS: Free testing 
at Student Health 
ContInued from ..... 1 
students who wish to visit countries 
which require an AIDS test prior to 
granting a visa. 

Samaniego-Kraus said that it is 
important for university health cen-
ters to offer free AIDS testing. 

Since HW, the virus that causes 
AIDS, can be present in the body for 
u many u 10 years before any 
symptoms appear, the implication 
is that many AIDS victims had con· 
tracted the disease during their col-
lege-age years. 

"[AIDS] is definitely rising in 
the age group of 20 to 29 .... We 
need to get the word out on cam-

pus," she said. 
Student Health Advocates, vol-

unteers at the Student Health Cen-
ter, are promoting activities center-
ing around HIV Awareness Week, 
which begins today. 

Advocate Madu Nanyan, who is 
helping to coordinate HIV Aware· 
ness Week on campus, said that one 
of the week's highlights will be the 
display of six panels from the AIDS 
quilt on Tuesday at the Price Center 
Ballroom. 

Other events include handing out 
free condoms and enrounging stu-
dents to donate a meal to Mama's 
Kitchen through Dining Services. 

"Mama's Kitchen is a San Di-
ego-based [charity]. They provide 
meals to people living with AIDS," 
Nanyan said.

TRACK: Triton 
Stars Come Through 

SLUGGERS: fensively flat UCSO squad. Friday's morning game against 
Division I LMU was a crucial one 
for the Tritons. Trailing 2-1 in the 
bottom of the sixth inning, UCSO 
came through. Freshman Nora 
Stephany smacked a high chopper 
to short which was bobbled by the 
Lions, allowing Stephany to reach 
first. She came around to score the 
tying run on a blistering single to 
center by catcher Kristy Schilling. 

UGSO erron to manufacture three-
runs in the lop of the eighth, and the 
Tritons could only muster a meager 
one-run response .

Robert Ho still chipped in an out-
standing performance for the Tri-

lightning-quick time of 9:24. 

The second game of the day

in the face of an offensive on-

UCSD clobbered Point Lorna in 
the final game of the tourney, 4-0,

Hey; on college campuses those "in the know" are the ones who rule. 
And it's not just about being smart in the classroom, its about being wise 
with your wallet as well, So if you want a great low price on a collect call, 
just dial1800-CALL-ATI It always costs less than 1-800-COLLECI: Always. 

There are lots of tricky things for you to learn at college, but h~re's 
something that's easy: KNOW THE CODE, and save the person on the 
other end some serious money. You'll be glad you did.

Triton 
Crew Has 
Win Bruin' 
TROUNCING: UCSD 
clobbered UCLA by 13 
seconds on Saturd~y 
By Tedd LIIdd 
Sports Editor 

While UCSD can't shaJce a stick 
at the recently crowned UCLA 
NCAA National Champion basket-

ball team, the 
Triton men's 
crew team can 
definitely 
hold its own 
against the 
Bruin rowing 
squad. 

At a dual 
race in Ma-

rina Del Rey last Saturday, the 
UCSD varsily "A" crewmen 
showed just how tough they really 
are, pummeling the host Bruins by 
a solid 13 seconds. 

"The Marina Del Rey course has 
a lide, so the times - in themselves 
- don 't mean that much," Triton 
Assistant Coach Michael Roberts 
said. 

Nonetheless, UCSD racked up a 
solid 6: 11 time, while UCLA 
slipped to a 6:24 mark. 

.. Any time around or under six 
minutes is excellent, no matter what 
the conditions are," Roberts said. 

Leading the victorious Triton 
boat was coxswain John Wang. On 
stroke for UCSD was Marcus 

, O'Brien. 
Teammates Evan Jacobs, John 

Roosendaal , Karim Rafaat, Matt 
Smith, Kurt Schnier and Ben 
Burling filled the seven through two 
rowing slots, consecutively. Sam 
Nichols headed up the bow for 
UCSD. 

UCLA, while not a perennial 
powerhouse, was still a fairly diffi- . 
cult opponent for the upstart Tritons 
- at last week's San Diego Crew 
Classic, the Bruins finished only 
slightly behind UCSD. 

With another victory under their 
belt, the Triton rowers can now look 
forward to the San Diego City 
Championships on April 29.

Michelle Malephansukal and Yumi 
Takemoto ousted Laura Anderson 
and Trina Smith, 8-3, to notch the 
home team 's first win. The number-
three twosome of Hilary Somers and 
Morgan Gessford followed their 
teammates with another 8-3 con-
quest - this time, at the expense of 
Cris Cooley and Julie Zadra. 

The only blemish was at the top 
spot, where Suzi Drage and Miki 
Kurokawa suffered an 8-0 defeat to 
Kristina loti and Claire Churchi. 

Top to bottom, the Tritons boast 
a powerful singles lineup, which 
prevailed in five of the six contests. 

At number one, Malephansukal 
faced the daunting task of going Ioe-
to-toe with the country's national 
champion, Churchi. The upset 
didn't occur, as Malephansukal was 
overcome, 6-1, 6-1. 

The rest of the scorecard was all 
UCSD. Drage rose to the occasion 
at the number-two slot, unsealing 
Lott, 6-2, 6-4; Somers dissembled 
Anderson, 6-0, 6- t; Kurokawl 
pounded Cooley, 6-3, 6-1; Gessford 
slapped Smith around, ~, 6-1; and 
Takemoto waved good-bye to 
Zadra, posting a 6-1,6-4 triumph.

Substance-Free Greek 
nvironments Gain Momentum 

Contrary to student 
perception, aU college students do 
not consume alcohol. In fact, the 
number of students who do not 
drink has steadily increased over 
the past 15 years. The Higher 
Education Research Institution at 
UCLA reports that in 1994 among 
college freshmen 47% did not drink 
beerin the past year. Thiscompares 
to 24% in 1981. The 1994 statistics 
are based upon 238,000 question-
naires distributed at 460 colleges 
and universities nationwide. 

Although the number of 
college students who are abstaining 
from alcohol is increasing, the 
number of college students who 
are binge drinkers remains steady, 
despite widespread educational 
efforts on the part of msntutions 
and Greek organizations. Binge 
drinking is defined as consuming 
five or more drinks at one sitting. 
The CORE lnstitute at Southern 
Illinois University projects that 
nearly two out of five college 
students are binge drinkers. 

A 1994 report issued by 
the Harvard School of Public Health 
in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association found that 
44% df c:04Jege students engage in 
billge drinking, and 19% were 
classified as &equent drinkers who 
have "binged" at least three times 
in preceding two-week period. The 

in fraternities are binge drinkers. 
Substance-free housing 

has been supported by data from 
the 1994 Harvard School of Public 
Health study and in the January 
1995 Fratunily Law, "this study 
documents the negative effects of 
drinking upon roommates, fellow 
students, and even innocent 
bystanders ... consequences include 
an increase in physical assaults, 
sexual harass-menf, property 
damage, interrupted sleep, and lost 
study time." 

"Compared to others, 
those who were binge drinkers 
were seven times as likely to have 
unprotected sex as non-binge 
drinICers, and ten times as likely to 
drive after drinking. Not surpris-
ingly, these drinkers were 11 times 
as likely to fall behind in their 
studies. Students who were not 
binge drinkers were more than 
twice as likely to be insulted or 
assaulted, sexually or otherwise, 
from binge drinking students. " 

Ongoing studies 
conclude that approximately one-
third of entering college students 
would choose to live in substance-
free residence halls if · offered. 
According to the Association of 
College and University Housing 
Officers, increasing numbers of 
colleges and universities are 
offering such an option with 

Elections Are jn 
the Air 

Spring quarter welcomes 
in the sunny San Diego 
weather, countdown to 
Summer, and the annual 
event of campus-wide 
elections. As candidates 
have been hitting the 

campaign trail for the last week the 
countdown to April 11 has finally 
arrived. Tomorrow, thousands of 
UCSD students will flock to the 
polls to determine their leaders for 
1995 -1996 A.S. Council as well as 
three highly touted pieces of fee 
referenda. Arguably, the most 
topical issue of this election period 
has been the Campus Life 
Referendum. This referendum has 
also been dubbed the MFootball 
Referendum· because, if passed, 
UCSD will introduce the NCAA 
football team. This is something 
virtual.ly unheard of in the history 
of UCSD. This referendum has 
been widely debated as it propOses 
to raise student fees by $29.50 per 
quarter. Opponents of this piece 
argue that the fee increase is too 
costly and will not sufficiently cover 
the costs of an NCAA football 
program. Proponents are quick to 
point out the sense of social 
cohesion that would be facilitated 
by such a team sport. Many 
students complain about the lack 
of social outlets at UCSD and this 
referendum hopes to enliven the 
campus-wide social life. The$29.5O 
per quarter fee increase is 
comprised of three areas offunding: 
$15.00 to go towards the formation 

and operation of an NCAA football 
team; $10.00 to go towards current 
UCSD NCAA sports teams other 
than football (intramurals); $4.50 
for A.S. UCSO activities 
(programming, college councils, 
student organizations, etc.). 

In addition, there are two 
other referendum, the Sports Club 
and the Student Retention 
Referendum will also be decided 
by the student body. The Sports 
Club item seeks to increase student 
fees by $3.00 per quarter in order to 
help fund campus sports programs, 
team sports like hockey, lacrosse, 
rugby, surfing, etc. The Student 
Retention Referendum seeks an 
increase of $6.50 per quarter; $4.50 
which will go to ASUCSD activities 
and $2.00 which will finance a 
student run retention program. In 
order to pass, all three referenda 
require a set number of voter 
turnout at the polls. The Campus 
Life Referendum requires 2,744 
(20% of student population) voters 
at the polls. Of this voter pool, it 
would require a 50%+1 majority. 
The Sports Club item requires a 
voter pool of 1,386 students and it 
needs to pass with two-thirds of 
that pool. The Student Retention 
item requires a voter pool of 2,744 
students and it needs a 50%+1 
majority- similar to the Campus 
Life bill. 

AS Elections Manager, Michael 
Lindstrom, feels that this election 
will bring about the largest voter 
turnout in several years. Last years 

LUMNS. 
.. '. . 

Eye on Academics 
James Lin, a member of 

Sigma N u fraternity, is a third year 
biochemistry and cell biology 
student at Revelle College. As a 
recipient of the President's 
Undergraduate Fellowship, Lin 
spends sixteen hours a week 
working under Dr. Christopher 
Wills. "Research at UCSD is a major 
element of this campus," he states. 
"Everyone who has a chance to get 
involved with research should." 
Lin's particular interests this year 
are comparing the cystic fibrosis 
gene in human populations as well 
as comparing the sex genes in fruit 
flies. 

Dr. Wills has been 
teaching at UCSD for 22 years. This 
quarter, he is teaching an upper 
division class in Molecular 
Evolution. Dr. Wills has already 
published three books. The last 
one was published in 1993 entitled 
The Runaway Brain. Heiscoming 
out with a book this year called 
PlaiYes. 

When not in lab or in the 
classroom James Lin isatthe library 
preparing for the upcoming 
MCA Ts. Taking twenty units this 
quarter, Lin admits his schedule 
for the next few weeks is packed. 
However, "if you manage your 
time, there are opportunities to do 
\Vhat you like." One such 
opportunity for which he finds both 
the time and the energy is his 

elections produced a meager 12% 
turnout, something Lindstromcalls 
"extremely pitiful." Because this 
election has so many issues 
regarding student fees, Lindstrom 
notes that students have been more 
involved in voiciJ'lg their support/ 
opposition to fee increases: 

"If students want change 
atUCSD,thepollsarethebestplace 
to voice such feelings. I am hopeful 
that students stand up and make 
that vote. With 16 hours of possible 
voting time and 6 poll locations 
conveniently located all over 
campus, there is no reason every 
student cannot vote. Its the 
student's fees- it's their vote to 
decide where they want their 
money go~. (Lindstrom) · 

He feels that his will mobilize 
students to tum out and voice their 
opinion. This election promises 
that every vote will, in fact, count. 
The polls are open from lOam-4pm, 
Tuesday, Wednesday and lOaJn.. 
2pm on Thursday. There will be 
six polling locations conveniently 
located around campus: RIMAC, 
Career Services quad, steps of 
MOM at Muir, Warren Lecture Hall 
walkway, Peterson Hall, and 
Revelle Plaza. Voters will be given 
a reward for voting by redeeming 
their ballot stubs at any of the Price 
Center food vendors for a &eeCoke. 
Take advantage of today's 

His involvement with the 
council has spanned the past 
three years. 

With so much occurring 
at once, Lin still finds time to pursue 
a minor in theater. As it stands, Lin 
belongs to Pacific Coast Talent, an 
agency based in Los Angeles and 
San Diego. So far, Lin has a ppeared 
in two commercials for an L.A. 
based Chinese shopping network. 
In addition, he obtained a role on 
the television shoot "Vanishing 
Son." However, he was unable to 
perform due to the midterm 
schedule that week. He would like 
to further his experiences in acting 
later. this quarter and over the 
summer. 

Lin has been a member of 
Sigma Nu fraternity for two years. 
He has served as the Sponsorship 
Chair for the spring rush of 1994 
and faU rush of 1995.

La Verne Triumphs Over the Tritons in Five 
By DM Kr8ft 
Associate Sports Editor 

The numbers were virtually identical and, 
unfortunately, so were -the results for the 
UCSO men's volleyball team this weekend. 

In back-to-back games 
against UCI and La Verne, 
UCSO's offense - led by 
Tom Bladt and Tyson Kerr, 
who accounted for 94 of 140 
kills in the matches - was 
unable to pull out a victory. 

The Leopards were sup-
posed to. be reachable prey 
for the scrappy but under-
manned Tritons. However, 

La Verne eeked out a five-set triumph over 
UCSO, denying the spikers a season sweep. 

The Tritons performance from game one 
to game five declined rapidly. In the open-
ing set, a 15-11 UCSD win, Kerr (20 kills) 
and Black (30 kills) whipped the Leopards 
with a blistering .459 bitting percentage. By 
the fifth game, though, UCSO's percentage 
had plummetted to .056 and its offense was 
anemic at best (six kills, five errors). 

The Tritons had built a two-games-10-
none advantage by smothering the Leopards 
in the second game, 15-2. UCSO did not give 
up without a fight, but La Verne did manage 
to pull out victories in games three and four 
by scortsofl5-9and 16-14. With rally scor-
ing in effect, the fifth game flew by, as did 
the Tritons' chances for a win. The leop-
ards won 15-11 to take the match, 3-2.

16 SPORTS 

THE [ynl[ 
SEAN RAHIMI 

Boxing Is For 
Bozos 

A lot of sports have fallen 
out of favor within the last 
year - baseball is a golden 
example - but no sport is as 
fundamentally screwed up as 
boxing. Why boxing? Well, I'll 
get to that. 

It's not that I don 't like 
boxing, at least in its purest 
form. It's a gruesome and 
violent duel of strength 
between two manly men. It 
practically urges the inflation 
of the masculine ego of every 
red-blooded male on the 
planet, except maybe for Pee 
Wee Herman. 

All kidding aside, however, 
one reason boxing is messed 
up is the plethora of federa-

U'. tions. I'm almost ready to form 
my own boxing federation. I'll 
call it the SBA, or Sean's 
Boxing Association. Everyone 
else is doing it. 

In fact, ever since Buster 
"Shamu" Douglas knocked out 
"Makmood Raiz" Tyson in 
1990, the boxing world has 
disintegrated into complete 
chaos. Originally, the sport 's 
three major organizations -
the WBA, the WBC, and the 
IBF were able to declare a 
unanimous champion. 

But now, new groups are 
• T starting to crop up faster than 

0 .] . Simpson TV movie offers. 
Now, there's the IBC, the . 
WBO, the lBO, the WBF and 
the WBU. And there are plenty 
more where Ihat came from, 
but I don 't want to fill my 
column with meaningless 

01" abbreviations. 
It's getting so bad that soon 

I'm going to have to call up 
Hooked on Phonics for some 
help. In my estimation, a new 
organization pops up every 
time Dick Vitale says "You 
better take a T.O., BABY!" 

Another big problem with 
boxing is the age issue. I don't 
mind seeing "Gorge" Foreman 
and his 10 kids on a TV 
sitcom. But please, do not 
attempt to convince me that his 
fight against Michael Moorer 
was legit. It looked more like a 
WWF fight or a Mark 

1I.Gastineau bout. 
For you lucky souls who 

didn't see the replay on 
SportsCenter, it went some· 
thing like this: Foreman throws 
a weak right and then Moorer 
looks to his corner for 
guidance, "Should I go down 
now?" 

I' ve had it . Boxing's just so 
bad right now. Now, ultimate 
frisbee, on the other hand ....

Racket Attack Near 
MEN: UCSD fell to 
both Westmont and 
see over the weekend 
By Hilary Somers 
Staff Writer 

After getting blistered in the sun 
by tough Division III opponents in 
Arizona, things haven't gotten any 

better for the 
UCSD men's ten-
nis team. 

Westmont 
came out to the 
Spanos courts on 
Friday, stealing 
all three doubles 
contests from the 
Tritons. 

The number-
one duo of Rob-

ert Ho and Dan Brounstein fought 
hard, but came up short, 8-6. The 
number-two team of Frank Heeb 
and Mike Wilson was also closed 
out, 8-5, and the new number-three 
combo of Ping Yeh and Emil Mihet 
lost by the same score. 

UCSD put up a fight in singles, 
however, as the top four players all 
went to three sets. But only one Tri-
ton came out on top - Brounstein 
at the number-two slot with a 6-4, 
5-7, 6-4 victory. 

Wilson, playing at number four, 
was having a tough tennis match-
or was it a yelling match? The en-
tire contest was a quarrel over calls, 
and Wilson finally let his man get 

Rob Ho (above) and Dan Brounsteln slipped to Westmont, 8-6. 
to him, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. Yeh sent his 
opponent home at the number six 
slot, 6-1, 6-4, to add the only other 
win of the day for UCSD. 

The Tritons had little time to 
dwell on the rougb loss, since they 
had another home match the next 
day against Southern California 
College. Looking exhausted, they 
were eaten for lunch, 7-0. 

The Vanguards strutted into the 
gates with their black sweatsuits, 
showing no mercy for UCSD with 
a victory sweep in doubles play. 

It wasn't ·very different in the 
singles matches either. Perhaps the 
best match of the day was at num-
ber three where Frank Heeb chal-
lenged his opponent, eventually fail-
ing, 6-1, 2-6, 4-6.

With over 1,600 total entrants, 
world-caliber athletes from Brazil 
and Australia, heats with open and 

center stage. 

invitational divi-
sions and a busy 
full-day schedule, 
the host team of 
last weekend's 
UCSD Track and 
Field Invitational 
sumed to get lost 
in the shuffle. 

That is, until 
Lisa Shepard took 

"[Shepard] was the star of the 
day," Head Coach Tony Salerno 
said. The Triton sophomore ~ensa­
tion hit NCAA National qualifying 
marks in both the triple jump 
(37'6") and the 100-meter hurdles 

(14.88), each a personal best. 
"This was probably the larg-

est athletic event in UCSD his-
tory," Salerno said. "'A meet of 
this magnitude would have been 
impossible without aU the help 
we received from the volunteers 
from women's crew and 
women's soccer." 

UCSD's Renee Sprowl didn 't 
need any help after nearly not ad-
vancing to the finals of her event. 
She proved that she belonged 
among the NCAA National ranks 
with a phenomenal long jump 
distance of 18'1" , only slightly 
off her personal best. 

On the men's side, Randy 
Buehler responded as well. Shar-
ing the pit with several Division 
I throwers, Buehler held his own,

WOMEN: The Tritons 
crunched Pomona-
Pitzer, 7-2, on Saturday 
By Dan Sweeney 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's the stretch run for the UCSD 
women's tennis team. The Division 
III Championships in Sweet Briar, 

VA loom on May 
9-15, meaning 
that Head Coach 
Liz laPlante and 
her band of 
racket-wielding 
stalwarts have a 
month to work 
out any lingering 
kinks in prepara-
tion. 

Saturday 's 7-2 
stomping of visiting Pomona-Pitzer 
indicates that, as they sit right now, 
the defending champion Tritons 
(13-2) will be feared contenders. 

"'We played a strong match," 
laPlante said of Saturday's power-
ful showing. "Pomona's not as 
strong as they've been in the past, 
in terms of depth." 

Somehow it seems fitting that the 
Tritons won .even despite miscues 
at both the top singles and doubles 
slots. Strong depth has been a trade-
mark for the team all year. 

As usual, the Tritons prevailed 
on the doubles front, taking two of 
three. The second-ranked combo of

Falc It's status quo. It doesn't give A.S. any 
more [power] than it has ever had - the chan-
cellor still has vetoing power over everything 
A.S. does. I think the need for autonomy is very 
evident on this campus. I think that for this cam-
pus to truly try to be a three part system, with 
students, faculty and staff, and administrators 
equally represented, we need some form of a 
union, which is really lacking. I've seen this on 
all levels, on the campus-wide, on the systemwide. 
Something thai was really telling to me was g0-
ing through the student regent selection process. 
The three finalists are passed on to the regents, 
and they pick who's going to represent students. 
Students don't have final say over who's going to 
be their representative, and that was something that 
we challenged this year. The alumni association

02 OPINION 

resl en 
The two presidential candidates, N._ 

'llik and "" •• ", could hardly be more 
different. FaUe is an activist. Barnes is closer 
to a traditionalist. Falk stands in opposition 
to the status quo. Barnes embraces it. Falk 
tackles broad, far-reaching issues. Barnes has 
smaller, but in many cases, more practical 
goals. 

If there is a tbread 
wbicb joins tbese 
two togetber, it 's 
found not in tbeir 
politics, but in tbeir 
resumes. Both Falk 
and Barnes are emi-
nently qualified to 
fill the AS. Council's 
highest office. 

NHIaI Falk has 
been extremely ac-
tive in student poli-
tics in tbe last two

NAOMI FALK 

PRESIDENT 

years, working extensively witb the UC Stu-
dents Association (UCSA) on issues sucb as 
fee hikes and minority outreach. Sbe bas 
served on tbe UCSA Board of Directors for 
two years and has occupied positions ranging 
from UCSA campus office director to cbair 
of tbe UCSA Fees and Financial Aid Com-
mittee. In addition, Falk bas served in a num-
ber of official A.S. positions, including assis-
tant student advocate, local-area lobby direc-
tor and systemwide lobby director. Finally, she 
was a finalist tbis year for the coveted posi-
tion of UC student regent. A fighter for stu-
dent issues, FaUc has rightly earned the respect 
of many of her colleagues. 

Heading tbe Legalize It slate, Falk comes 
into the president contest with a progressive, 
if not radical, agenda. Echoing tenets of the 
platform on which sbe ran for A.S. external 
last year, Falk proposes establishing a student-
run minority-retention 'program (see fee ref-
erendum question three), and a financial-aid 
peer-couoseling program. 

In addition, Falk promises to open up the 
A.S. Council and make it more accessible to 
students. WbiJe most candidates make this 
claim during elections, Falk steers away from 
banal suggestions sucb as making flyers and 
proposes bringing tbe council to students. Ac-
cording to Falk, if she is elected president, the 
A.S. will hold its meetings not in A.S. offices 
at the Price Center, but at the individual col-
leges - one week at Warren, tbe next at 
Thurgood, the following at Muir and so fortb. 
In addition, she proposes televisingA.S. meet-
ings and requiring that AS. Council members 
hold "office" hours at public locations such 
as tbe Grove Cafe. 

Addressing students' ongoing gripe about 
UCSD being a socially backward campus, 
Falk promises improved programming and 
events, touting her slatemate Kevin Moo 
(commissioner of programming) as someone 
wbo could turit UCSD around. In addition, 
she's confident that given the R1MAC arena, 
A.S. Programming could actually generate 
money from its big shows. 

The core of ber platform, however, is stu-
dent autonomy. The issue du jour last elec-
tion tbe administration sbot down sbredded 
and recycled the A.S. student autonomy pro-
posal into a relatively meaningless document 
early this academic year. Since hitting this 
roadblock, A.S. President Carla Tesak and 
otber proponents on council have dropped the 
issue, considering further negotiations futile. 
Unwilling admit defeat, Falk promises to con-
tinue to fight for full-fledged autonomy if 
elected president - even going so far as to 
advocate suing the UCSD administration.

OUR PICK: 
JENNIFER NICOLL 

VICE PIU!SIDENT 

ADMINISTRATIVE 

informed on a wide range of issues, Nicoll 
and her slate say they are running against 
the status quo of "special interest" poli-
tics and behind-the-scenes maneuvering. 
She vows to avoid these sandtraps and 
pusb for grass-roots politics, assuring all 
groups - from fraternities to student af-
firmative-action groups - are treated 
equally. According to Nicoll, conflicts 
witbin council and on campus is endemic, 
and few student representatives and groups 
are willing to find tbat sacred middle 
ground. 

As a vice president administrative can-
didate, her goals include improving A.S. 
communications with tbe student body 
tbrough outreach programs, ensuring tbat 
A.S. programming and services reflect tbe 
diversity at UCSD and improving the ac-
countability of individuals sitting on tbe 
various campus-wide committees. Citing 
the controversial Library Walk, the focus 
of one sucb committee, Nicoll said theA.S. 
bas an obligation to assure tbat students are 
fairly represented. 

An A.S. newcomer, .ebecal CI.tl 
comes armed with impressive experience 
in parliamentary procedure, in particular, 
the intricacies of Roger's Rules of Order. 
Clark is member of the National Associa-
tion of Parliamentarians, has served on nu-
merous organizational and non-UCSD stu-
dent-government boards and currently 
holds an elected public office in the com-

munity colleges. While not particularly 
well-versed on the specifics ofUCSD poli-
tics, she bas a good grasp of wbat tbe posi-
tion would demand. 

Like Nicoll, Clark calls for greater com-
munication between the A.S. Council, the 
campus-wide committees and the admin-
istration to assure that students receive fair 
representation. Clark also expresses con-
cern for larger issues such as fee increases 
and threats to federal financial aid, and 
thinks she could be an influential voice 
for UCSD. Overall, she promises to be a 
fair and impartial player who will work 
toward expanding student involvement in 
council. 
-... Le6II, an AS. outsider with 

little student leadership experience outside 
of bigh school, is vying for the vice presi-
dent administrative position on The Great 
Triumvirate slate. While expressing a 
strong desire to get involved and improve 
communications between the A.S. and the 
student body, Le6n is sbort on specific 
goals and exhibits a lack of knowledge on 
AS. and student issues. The vice president 
administrative position, like all AS. officer 
slots, requires a solid background, whicb 
Le6n does not have. 

TOIII SeMlItt, who is currently the edi-
. tor in chief of The Koala, is the joker of the 
bunch, coming into tbe office with neither 
student government experience nor an ap-
parent desire to run a serious campaign. 
Strangely billed on the Legalize It slate, 
Schmitt's statement, as printed in the A.S.-
funded pullout section in this issue, reads 
as a Koala "top five" list of why students 
should vote for him. While be did not sched-
ule a Guardian interview, with such stupid 
gags as "If elected, I wholeheartedly prom-
ise that Stryper will rock RIMAe by the 
end of next year," it's clear Schmitt sbould 
stay out of AS. politics and spend his time 
brushing up on bis humor. 

Of the four candidates, only two -
Nicoll and Clark - have tbe requisite ex-
perience to take on this demanding and criti-
cal post. While Oark exhibits a strong gen-
eral background, she's not as knowledge-
able about tbe inner workings of the coun-
cil. Nicoll, on the other band, has proved 
herself in A.S. government, is extremely in-
formed on issues big and small, and appears 
to have an earnest desire to overcome petty, 
"status quo" politicking. For these reasons, 
the Guardilut endorses Nicoll for vice presi-
dent administrative.

02 OPINION 

resl en 
The two presidential candidates, NIMI" 

Flilk and .... I. ra.I, could hardly be more 
different. Falk is an activist. Barnes is closer 
to a traditionalist. Falk stands in opposition 
to the status quo. Barnes embraces it. Falk 
tackles broad, far-reaching issues. Barnes has 
smaller, but in many cases, more practical 
goals. 

If there is a thread 
which joins these 
two together, it 's 
found not in their 
politics, but in their 
resumes. Both Falk 
and Barnes are emi-
nently qualified to 
fill the A.S. Council's 
highest office. 

....... Falkhas 
been extremely ac-
tive in student poli-
tics in the last two 

OUR PICK: 
NAOMI FALK 

PRESIDENT 

years, working extensively with the UC Stu-
dents Association (UCSA) on issues such as 
fee hikes and minority outreach. She has 
served on the UCSA Board of Directors for 
two years and has occupied positions ranging 
from UCSA campus office director to chair 
of the UCSA Fees and Financial Aid Com-
mittee. [n addition, Falk has served in a num-
ber of official A.S. positions, including assis-
tant student advocate, local-area lobby direc-
tor and systemwide lobby director. Finally, she 
was a finalist this year for the coveted posi-
tion of UC student regent. A fighter for stu-
dent issues, Falk has rightly earned the respect 
of many of her colleagues. 

Heading the Legalize It slate, Falk comes 
into the president contest with a progressive, 
if not radical, agenda. Echoing tenets of the 
platform on wbich she ran for A.S. external 
last year, Falk proposes establishing a student-
run minority-retention program (see fee ref-
erendum question three), and a financial-aid 
peer-counseling program. 

In addition, Falk promises to open up the 
A.S. Council and make it more accessible to 
students. While most candidates make tbis 
claim during elections, Falk steers away from 
banal suggestions such as making flyers and 
proposes bringing the council to students. Ac-
cording to Faile, if she is elected president, the 
A.S. will hold its meetings not in A.S. offices 
at the Price Center, but at the individual col-
leges - one week at Warren, the next at 
Thurgood, the following at Muir and so forth. 
In addition, she proposes televisingA.S. meet-
ings and requiring thatA.S. Council members 
hold "office" hours at public locations such 
as the Grove Cafe. 

Addressing students' ongoing gripe about 
UCSD being a socially backward campus, 
Falk promises improved programming and 
events, touting her slatemate Kevin Moo 
(commissioner of programming) as someone 
wbo could turit UCSD around. In addition, 
she's confident tbat given the RlMAC arena, 
A.S. Programming could actually generate 
money from its big sbows. 

The core of her platform, bowever, is stu-
dent autonomy. The issue du jour last elec-
tion tbe administration shot down shredded 
and recycled the A.S. student autonomy pro-
posal into a relatively meaningless document 
early this academic year. Since hitting this 
roadblock, A.S. President Carla Tesak and 
other proponents on council have dropped tbe 
issue, considering further negotiations futile . 
Unwilling admit defeat, Falk promises to con-
tinue to fight for full-fledged autonomy if 
elected president - even going so far as to 
advocate suing the UCSD administration. 

Falk ties student autonomy to wider, s~­

GUARDIAN Indorsements for PreSidential, Vice·Presidential, and Commissioner POSitions 

IN THE 

Vice President Administrative 
One of the most powerful positions on 

the A.S. Council, vice president adminis-
trative is charged with chairing A.S. meet-
ings and setting the agenda. Often closely 
aligned with the president, v.P. administra-
tive also solicits and appoints individuals 
to the student slots on campus-wide com-
mittees. 

Running on the 
Uniting New Ideas 
Througb Experi-
ence (UNITE) . 

OUR PICK: 

slate, Jennifer 
fIooIl bas a solid 
foundation in A.S. 
government, serv-
ing as Muir fresh-
man senator last 
year and currently 
the Muir sopbo- JENNlf!ll NICOLL more senator, A.S. 
president pro VICE PRESIDENT 
tempore and AS. ADMINISTRATIVE 
Senate chair. Well-
informed on a wide range of issues, Nicoll 
and her slate say they are running against 
the status quo of "special interest" poli-
tics and behind-the-scenes maneuvering. 
She vows to avoid these sandtraps and 
push for grass-roots politics, assuring all 
groups - from fraternities to student af-
firmative-action groups - are treated 
equally. According to Nicoll, conflicts 
within council and on campus is endemic, 
and few student representatives and groups 
are willing to find that sacred middle 
ground. 

As a vice president administrative can-
didate, her goals include improving A.S. 
communications with the student body 
tbrough outreach programs, ensuring that 
A.S. programming and services ret1ect the 
diversity at UCSD and improving the ac-
countability of individuals sitting on the 
various campus-wide committees. Citing 
the controversial Library Walk, the focus 
of one such committee, Nicoll said theA.S. 
has an obligation to assure tbat students are 
fairly represented. 

An A.S. newcomer, .ebecc. CI.tl 
comes armed with impressive experience 
in parliamentary procedure, in particular, 
the intricacies of Roger's Rules of Order. 
Clark is member of the National Associa-
tion of Parliamentarians, has served on nu-
merous organizational and non-UCSD stu-
dent-government boards and currently 
holds an elected public office in the com-

munity colleges. While not particularly 
well-versed on ·the specifics of UCSD poli-
tics, she bas a good grasp of what the posi-
tion would demand. 

Uke Nicoll, aark calls for greater com-
munication between the A.S. Council, the 
campus-wide committees and the admin-
istration to assure that students receive fair 
representation. auk also expresses con-
cern for luger issues such as fee increases 
and threats to federal financial aid, and 
tbinks sbe could be an influential voice 
for UCSD. Overall, she promises to be a 
fair and impartial player wbo will work 
toward expanding student involvement in 
council. 

AICeIIca Le6n, an AS. outsider witb 
little student leadership experience outside 
of high school, is vying for the vice presi-
dent administrative position on The Great 
Triumvirate slate. While expressing a 
strong desire to get involved and improve 
communications between the AS. and the 
student body, Le6n is short on specific 
goals and exhibits a lack of knowledge on 
A.S. and student issues. The vice president 
administrative position, like allA.S. officer 
slots, requires a solid background, whicb 
Le6n does not have. 

TOIIIIclMnItt, who is currently the edi-
. tor in cbief of The Koala, is the joker of the 
bunch, coming into the office with neither 
student government experience nor an ap-
parent desire to run a serious campaign. 
Strangely billed on the Legalize It slate, 
Scbmitt's statement, as printed in the A.S.-
funded pullout section in this issue, reads 
as a Koala "top five" list of why students 
should vote for bim. While he did not scbed-
ule a Guardian interview, with sucb stupid 
gags as "If elected, I wholeheartedly prom-
ise tbat Stryper will rock RIMAC by the 
end of next year," it's clear Schmitt should 
stay out of A.S. politics and spend his time 
brushing up on his humor. 

Of the four candidates, only two -
Nicoll and Clark - have the requisite ex-
perience to take on this demanding and criti-
cal post. While Clark exbibits a strong gen-
eral background, she's not as knowledge-
able about the inner workings of the coun-
cil. Nicoll, on the other hand, has proved 
herself in A.S. government, is extremely in-
formed on issues big and small, and appears 
to have an earnest desire to overcome petty, 
"status quo" politicking. For these reasons, 
the Guartiian endorses NicoU for vice presi-
dent administrative. 

Vice Presidenl finance 
The vice president of finance controls 

the A.S. budget, allocates funds to student 
organizations and works with the 
commissioner of 
operations to 
m.:a intain and 
expand student 
b:::;inesses. In 
aodition, the V.P. 
finance allocates 
funds appropriately 
under Smith v. 
Regents guidelines, 
which prohibits OUR PICK: 
using mandatory 
student fees for EDMJNoo RcaN30N 
organizations and VICE PRESIDENT 
activities deemed FINANCE 
religious or 
ideological in nature. 

Ed .... o ...... 011, who is running 
on the UNITE slate, bas served as Student 
Affirmative Action Coalition (SAAC) rep-
resentative to the AS. Council for one year 
and has been active in the African Ameri-
can Student Union (AASU) for two years. 
In addition, he has attended Finance Com-
mittee meetings and has a working under-
standing of how they are run. If elected vice 
president of finance, his main goal would 
focus on funding for student organizations. 
The executive budget, he says, can be used 
to fund the needs of student organizations 
sucb as travel through the Student Organi-
zation Funding Board and the Cultural Pro-
gramming Funding Board. Robinson sup-
ports revising the financial bylaws to "get 
rid of all the excess stuff that's not being 
paid attention to," as well as increasing tbe 
number of senators, which be says would 
simplify A.S. meetings. 

Jo-. C ..... is also running for V.P. 

finance. Recently appointed to · the 
Chancellor's Advisory Committee for Edu-
cational Policy, Cheng sits on the Univer-
sity Center Advisory Board (UCAB).In ad-
dition, she bas worked in the purchasing 
department of a corporation, and says her 
studies in economics would give ber an 
edge in the position. 

Oleng's main goal is to cut red tape of 
the A.S. budgeting process, wbich she says 
is extremely inefficient. If elected, she said 
sbe would focus on student organizations 
and promised to fairly distribute the $13.50 
Student Activity Fee. Cheng proposes initi-
ating small fund-raising projects, such as 
selling candy bars, instead of aiming for 
huge, unrealistic fund-raising goals. 

Running on the Legalize It slate, 
N,I .. _ is the campaign coordinator 
for the California Public Interest Research 
Group (CALPIRG) and has never served 
in student government. However, he claims 
that this lack of experience gives him the 
advantage of having no preconceived no-
tions of how tbe A.S. sbould work. Unfor-
tunately, his inexperience, especially in a 
position such as finance, could ultimately 
be detrimental to the council, since he 
would spend much of his time learning the 
job rather than doing it. 

Though both Robinson and Cheng have 
similar visions of improving student-orga-
nization funding, Robinson 's agenda is 
clearly more effective in meeting this goal. 
While Cheng talks of candy-bar sales, 
Robinson has moved on to bigger issues like 
using the executive budget to student orga-
nizations' advantage. Robinson is also more 
experienced and bas a better knowledge of 
council and student-organization finance 
issues. The Guardian endorses Robinson 
for vice president finance. 

Vice President External A irs . 
The position of vice president external 

is historically one of the most active posi-
tions on the council, both representing stu-
dents on a system-wide level and serving 
as a Hason to tbe community. Since tbe 
Smiths v. Regents ruling, whicb bars spend-
ing mandatory student fees on activities 
deemed political, religious or ideological, 
the office has been somewhat declawed, 
probibiting lobbying the state legislature 
against fee increases. However, system-
level lobbying on various issues, including 

fees, is still allowed and minority outreacb 
and recruitment remains an essential mis-
sion of the vice president external. 

ErIk ... I.,n, the sole candidate for this 
position, has worked in tbe Office of Ex-
ternal Affairs in the last year and organized 
the successful "Shirts Off Our Backs" cam-
paign at UCSD. Although we have beard 
positive things about Nielsen, he unfortu-
nately did not scbedule an interview with 
the GUQrdian and therefore, we can not 
rightly endorse him for the position. 

" 
A.S. Elections 

Commissioners 
ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 

The responsibilities of the commissioner 
of academic affairs include working with the 
Undergraduate Affairs Office, representing 
the council to the administration and faculty 
on academic matters, and providing surveys 
to assess students' academic concerns. In ad-
dition, the commissioner sits on tbe Commit-
tee of Educational Policy and Courses as a 
representative to tbe Academic Senate. 

Candidate Dam.en WlipItz, the current 
A.S. vice president of external affairs, bas had 
prior experience as tbe UCSD affirmative-
action representative to UCSA and has 
worked for curricular reform with the UCSA 
academic affairs committee. He was also cbair 
of the 1995 Students of Color Conference. 

If elected commissioner of academic af-
fairs, Wilpitz says be would continue to imple-
ment current Commissioner Dave Valentine's 
projects, such as gaining more units for classes 
which require extensive labwork and extend-
ing the date to drop without a "W" until the 
sixtb week. [n addition, Wilpitz would push 
to make UCSD as strong in the humanities 
and social sciences as it is in the sciences. 
Wilpitz's agenda includes reforming college 
curricula to include ethnic-studies programs, 
centralizing academic departments such as 
biology to make them more acce~ible to stu-
dents, and increasing tbe availability of 
courses whicb are presently impacted. He 
would like to start an academic pecr-coun-
seling program, in wbicb seniors of a given 
major would advise lower-class students of 
the same major. 

The second contender in the race is cur-
rent Revelle College Council Chair ..... 
Un. Lin is running on a platform similar to 
Wdpitz, pledging to give the university a well-
rounded image by highlighting UCSD's non- ir 
science academic programs. To initiate pub-
licity for the humanities and social science 
departments, he proposes publishing pam-
phlets wbich will describe non-science pro-
grams and majors, as well as establishing 
more humanities and social-science seminars. 
In addition to these projects Lin says he hopes 
to extend the "W" drop date to the fiftb or 
sixth week and, like Wilpitz, proposes to raise 
the units for lab classes. Lin would also like 
to publicize and expand the faculty mentor 
program. 

The tbird candidate, Aand ......, ... , 
has relatively little experience and is running 
on a sparse agenda. Saying be would like to 
co.ntinue Valentine's project, be also called for 
doing a sutvey to gauge students' opinions 
on what issues they feel are important. How-
ever, beyond that, be doesn't seem to bave 
any insight into running this office. 

Although Lin and Wilpitz are both quali-
fied candidates, Wilpitz' platform is more 
focused on students rather than changing the 
outside community's perception of UCSD. 
Making UCSD more than just a "science 
school" requires more than just publicity. 
Wilpitz' curricular reform ideas would not 
only change the university's image, it would 
actually change tbe university itself. For this 
reason, tbe Guardian endorses Damien 
Wdpitz for commissioner of academic affairs. 

COMMUNICATIONS 
The Alternative Media Committee, headed 

by the commissioner of communications, is 
responsible for distributing funding among the 
campus' dozen or so publications (excluding 
the Guardian, which receives no A.S. fund-
ing) and maintaining media computer equip-
ment.

Spons Clubs and Recreation offer an athletic and social 
oudet to all sludents at UCSD. The program is open to 
everyone regardless of athletic talent or experience. 
Currently UCSD has ten Sport Clubs and 35 Rccn:ation 
Clubs. With Ihe elimination of the P.E. programs, the 
opportunity for students to participate in athlelic activity 
has diminished gn:atly. Wilh only $3.00 a quarter this 
Spons Cub Refen:ndum will allow us 10 expand our 
program greatly and give the opportunity for all sludents to 
participate. University regulations will allow the money 
only 10 fund the costs of transportation, equipment, basic 
team expenses and improving facilities . 

Campus Ure Bill 
ProponeDt: Greg HelU'll 
College should be the most exciting period of life. The 
variely and caliber of opportunilies (academic, social, 
cultural, athletic, etc.) provided by a university often 
determine the qualily of a student's undergraduate 
experience. For UCSD, the Campus Life Refen:ndum 
would dramatically increase such opportunities, and at a 
very small cost. For the same price as dinner (It 
McDonald's) Ind a movie for two, UCSD students could: 
have I strong football team, better fund all intercolle&iate 
teams, increase sJudent organization and college activities, 
and fund programming events (such as free concerti, a 
homecoming week, cheap movies It the Price Center, 
etc.). \bte Yes!

JOHN BARNES 
I am a Revelle lunior and have served 
as VP Administrative for 2 years. My 
goal as President will be 10 improve 
the Campus climate at UCSD. In ad-
dition to maintaining the services cur-
n:ntly provided by the A.S., I plan to 
improve the campus climate in 3 ways: 

Incn:ase the number of student-
run evenlS such as RIMAe con-
certs, Sun God Festival, 
WinterFest, and TGIF's. 
Stn:ngthen sludent voice in the 
community on housing and trans-
portation issues by lobbying for 
a student n:presentative on local 
city councils. 
work for belter altemative trans-
portation options for students 
such as bikeways and expanded 
bus lines. 

I will use my experience in student 
govemment 10 establish a com-
petenl and professional student 
association that is molivated 10 
work tin:lessly for the rights of 
ou r students. 

NAOMIFALK 
LEGALIZE IT 
Representation- prioritize and maxi-
mize sludent organizalion funding. 
cn:ation of a Pn:sident's cabinet, com-
posed of various constituencies, would 
sel agenda cn:ation of student organi-
zations council 
·Empowerment-A.S. autonomy, fi-
nally. 
• Advocacy-start state and national 
lobby on student issues such as fees 
and financial aid. 
Accessibility-conduct regular town 
meetings on issues n:quin: all A.S. of-
fices to hold office hou rs in visible, 
public places. 
·Accountability-televise weekly A.S. 
meetings live on UCSD Cable net-
work. 
I am currently a member of the UC 
Student Association Board of Direc-
tors and Chair of the Fees and Finan-
cial Aid Committee. I was one of the 
three finalists for '95- '96 U.C. Student 
Regent, the only undergraduate. But

sion. \bte for change, vote for ~gal·

the moll favorable choice for VICe 

The UCSD Guardian • A.S. Elections Advertising Section 

Pn:sidenl Administrative: Plalform 
and Experience. My four point plan 
is directed to serve all UCSD 
students. First, I plan 10 coordinate 
AS. programming and services 10 
better cater to diverse student 
groups. Second, I wish 10 promote 
the direct interaction between A.S. 
Council and the pnera! student body 
through outreach projects (such as 
pizza give-aways and AS. nipt at 
the pub). Thi rd, I will further 
cooperation between A.S. and 
College Councils with leldership 
training and retreats. Finally, I will 
enhance accountability and commu-
nication between Clmpus-wide 
committee representatives and A.S. 
Council 

In terms of experience, 
I am currently President Pro-
Tempon: of A.S. Councillnd Sen-
ate Chair. Thus,I have the knowl-
edge and training necessary 10 
perfonn the duties of V.P. Admin-
istrative. Serving as a college 
Senator for the past two years, 
taught me to understand, and re-
act to students' wants and needs. 
I am actively involved in numer-
ous A.S. and ~uir committees, as 
well as PAC, the student organi-
zation I founded. I am the only 
candidate for V.P. Administrative 
that has the extensive experience 
necessary for this intemll posi-
lion. \bte for me, lennifer Nicoll, 
for V.P. Administrative, and the 
U.N.I.T.E. slate.

the complications of the Finance of-

ACADEMIC 

ANAND MANDYAM 
The position of the Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs has just started to 
gain momentum. The main duty of 
this office is to repn:sent the views of 
students to the faculty and administra-
tion on issues dealing with the educa-
tional policies. I acknowledge the con-
tributions that the Commissioner in the 
preceding term has accomp'lished and 
I wish 10 address new ones: Many is-
sues I would work on include the ex-
tension of the "W" deadline for with-
drawing from courses, increasing the 
units of certain lab classes, and clos-
ing the gap between students and pro-
fessors. The bottom line is that I want 
to be a council member 10 whom ANY 
student would feel comfortable ex-
pressing their concems - as the duty 
of each of these council posilions is to 
serve the needs of you, the undergradu-
ate student. I am going to make sure 
that this is not just another hollow

Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
serves as their megaphone. Sludents 
need someone who will start

elected, time would not be wasted on 
learning the ropes or building 
working relations. I have experience, 
not only serving on AS. Council, but 
also working closely with other UC

OPERATIONS 
SERVICES 

I am a third year Biochemistry major 
from Muir. The basic premise of my 
campaign is to improve the overall 
quality of student life by reinforcing, 
adding to, and improving upon the ser-
vices and enterprises already offered 
by the A.S. such as the Grove Clffe, 
Lecture Notes, Soft Reserves, etc. In 
addition, I would like to focus upon 
protecting Co-op solvency and encour-
aging cooperation/communication 
amongst A.S. officers. As. a student, 
please vote to ensure that the services 
you desire will continue to be offered 
by theA.S.

this major, I'm hoping to pursue a

will implement various agendas 
from my predecessor, such as lJIe 
plan for the 24 hour on campus food 
delivery. This plan will enable 
students to order food from local 
restaurants with no surcharge. Also, 
I will try to generate the funds to buy 
a hard drive thlt will enable student 

.. organizations to gain access to the 
Webnet.~my 
aRnlroR m~rc-.IC many 
students who are dissatisfied with 
the shortage of classes covered in AS 
Lecture notes. Therefore, it will be 
in my agenda to expand AS Lecture 
notes in order for more students to 
make use of this service. I hope to 
accomplish these goals and more 
through interaction with the student 

Currently 11m the Oub Scene 
Editor of URB Magazine. If elected, 
I plan to take my knowledge and 
experience with the music business 
and bring to UCSD the most 
phenomenal events the Sun God has 
ever seen. Expect full utilization of 
RIMAe. the first concert arena that 
UCSD has ever had. With a 5,000 
capacity on-ampus venue now 
available, the proaramming 
possibilltica for UCSD are limitless.

goal is to provide more support for the

Positions 

finance. Recently appointed to · the 
CbanceUor 's Advisory Committee for Edu-
~tional Policy, Cheng sits on the Univer-
sity Center Advisory Board (UCAB). In ad-
dition, she has worked in the purcbasing 
department of a corporation, and says her 
studies in economics would give ber an 
edge in the position. 

(lIeng's main goal is to cut red tape of 
the A.S. budgeting process, which she says 
is extremely inefficient. If elected, she said 
she would focus on student organizations 
and promised to fairly distribute the $13.50 
Student Activity Fee. Cheng proposes initi-
ating small fund-raising projects, such as 
selling c:aady bars, iDStead of aiming for 
buge, unrealistic fund-raising goals. 

Running on the Legalize It slate, 
N •• 8OII ... is the campaign coordinator 
for the California Public Interest Research 
Group (CALPIRG) and has never served 
in student government. However. he claims 
tbat this lack of experience gives bim the 
advantage of baving no preconceived no-
tioDS of how the A.S. sbould work. Unfor-
tunately, his inexperience, especially in a 
position sucb as finance, could ultimately 
be detrimental to the council, sioce he 
would spend much of his time learning the 
job ratber than doing it. 

Though both Robinson and Cheog have 
similar visioDS of improving student-orga-
nization funding, Robinson's agenda is 
clearly more effective in meeting this goal. 
While Cheng talks of candy-bar sales, 
Robinson has moved on to bigger issues like 
using the executive budget to student orga-
nizations' advantage. Robinson is also more 
experienced and bas a better knowledge of 
council and student-organization finance 
issues. The GUIlrdilln endorses Robinson 
for vice president finance.

Ertk tI ...... the sole candidate for this 
position, has worked in the Office of Ex-
ternal Affairs in the last year and organized 
the successful "Shirts Off Our Backs" cam-
paign at UCSD. Altbough we have beard 
positive things about Nielsen, he unfortu-
nately did not schedule an interview with 
the GUIlrdilln and therefore, we can not 
rightly endorse bim for the position. 

Commissioners 
ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 

The responsibilities of the commissioner 
of academic affairs include working with the 
Undergraduate Affairs Office, representing 
the council to the administration and faculty 
on academic matters, and providing surveys 
to assess students' academic concerns. In ad-
dition, the commissioner sits on the Commit-
tee of Educational Policy and Courses as a 
representative to the Academic Senate. 

Candidate .,...Ien WllpItz, the current 
AS. vice president of external affairs, bas had 
prior experience as the UeSD affinnalive-
action representative to UeSA and has 
worked for curricular refonn with the UCSA 
academic affairs committee. He was also chair 
of the 1995 Students of Color Conference. 

If elected commissioner of academic af-
fairs, Wllpitz says he would continue to imple-
ment current Commissioner Dave Valentine's 
projects, such as gaining more units for classes 
which require extensive labwork and extend-
ing the date to drop without a "W" until the 
sixth week. In addition, Wilpitz would pusb 
to make UCSD as strong in the humanities 
and social sciences as it is in the sciences. 
Wtlpitz's agenda includes reforming college 
curricula to include etbnic-studies programs, 
centralizing academic departments such as 
biology to make them more accessible to stu-
dents, and increasing the availability of 
courses which are presently impacted. He 
would like to start an academic peer-coun-
seling program, in which seniors of a given 
major would advise lower-class students of 
the same major. 

The second contender in the race is cur-
rent Revelle College Council Chair J_II 
Un. Lin is running on a platform similar to 
Wtlpitz, pledging to give the university a weU-
rounded image by highlighting UCSD's non- k 
science academic programs. To initiate PUb-, 
licity for the humanities and social science 
departments, he proposes publishing pam-
phlets which will describe non-science pro-
grams and majors, as well as establishing 
more humanities and social-science seminars. 
In addition to these projects Lin says he hopes 
to extend the "W" drop date to the fifth or 
sixth week and, like Wtlpitz, proposes to raise 
the units for lab classes. Lin would also like 
to publicize and expand the faculty mentor 
program. 

The tbird candidate, AMnd .1IIIdpnI, 
bas relatively little experience and is running 
on a sparse agenda. Saying he would like to 
co.ntinue Valentine's project, he also called for 
doing a survey to gauge students' opinions 
on wbat issues tbey feel are important. How-
ever, beyond that, he doesn't seem to bave 
any insight into running this office. 

Althougb Lin and Wilpitz are both quali-
fied candidates, Wilpitz' platfonn is more 
focused on students rather than changing the 
outside community's perception of UCSD. 
Making UCSD more than just a "science 
scbool" requires more than just publicity. 
Wilpitz' curricular reform ideas would not 
only change the university'S image, it would 
actually cbange the university itself. For this 
reason, the Guardian endorses Damien 
Wtlpitz for commissioner of academic affairs.

TheAltemative Media Committee. headed 

by the commissioner of communications, is

students. ... That may seem like a really gen-
eral, idealistic: goal, but I have a Il}.point plat-
form dlat will ... make steps lOward _plish-

ASUCSD has had a misbalaooe of ilS rep-
resentation of 1lUdents. ... There .. aaually two 
apedI of the AS. - one is the repraclltation 
of students, the other is the ability for lIS 10 pr0-
vide servica to students. In tema of ~pmlCn­
lalion, we have done an excellenl job ... on the 
system-wide level. We have a compelen~ pr0-
fessional staff workina out of our external of-
fice Who has done a great job 1dv00000na stu-
dent iIsua in Sacramento through the UCSA 
and through other UCSA-sponaorecI events. 
However, ASUCSD has done a vay poor job ... 
in repraentiDa studenll here .... For i-..ce, we 
have about 40 lqIIaCIIIIIIives who lit on cam-
pusswide 00IIIIIIi1leea, and we have one person 
who lill on the IIoInI of Dim:Un oC the UCSA. 
However,the lime thai', llpent workina on sys-
Iem-wide iIsua IIIrouBb the [VP eaICmaI] is

One would be a state and national lobby offICe, 
which would rejoin USSA(U.S. StudentAsso-
ciation). I think Ihat's really i mportan~ and iI's 
really current. On the slate level, we need an 
augmenlation 10 the UC budgel or we 're gel-
ting another fee increase next year-thal'sjust 
a given. Currenlly, the UC adminisuation is 
lobbying for a fee increase and there 's no one 
up there [the capitOl), afler Smith, to counler 
whal lhey'~ saying, and we need to start get-
ting students back up in the capilOl. The legis· 
lators listen when studenlS come and testify. On 
the national level, Newt Gingrich is aying 10 
get rid of a 101 of the federally funded financial 
aid. including the Stafford Loan Program, the 
Perkins Loan Program and the Pell Granl Pr0-
gram. Campus·based aid programs and Cal 
Grant programs, even Ihough they ' re stale 
funded, arc partially federally subsidized, and 
they would also be in danger, which would au-
tomatically eliminate about one out of every 
four studenlS in the UC system. 

The average graduating loan debt would 
in=_ by almost 50 pcrcen~ and most people 
would be completely unable to go on 10 gradu-
ate school and professional school. '!bose thai 
go Ihe whole nine yards, go through grad school, 
would be graduating two, three limes as much

UCSA has completely changed its focus. 
It is now solely dealing with systemwide is-
sues. The kinds of changes you can effect within 
the system I think arc few and small, but are 
still relevant. The issues they've been worlcing 
with are campus safety, domestic housing, giv-
ing gay and lesbian couples righlS 10 married 
housing, academic consolidation, enrollment 
planning, all the affirmalive-aaion issues that 
are very up and coming. A 101 of these issues 
were being neglected and I think iI's very im-
portant that they be dealt wi th ... which is why 
if and when we do win on Smith, I don'l think 
UCSA should do the lobbying, because I don 'I 
think there's a capacity wilh staff, the board, 
the per.;on power, 10 do both, which is what 
we're trying 10 mate the UC lobby for. 

........... UCSACIOII'I 
We pay $ 1.50 per student 11'5 a big chunk 

of the budge~ bull'd definitely say it's worth it 
for the kind of ~presenlltion we gel UCSA

No, no - the way it is ript now, we have 

100 few students doing too much work .... So 
that office needs to be expanded.

oversight of that office. I think thai has hap-
pened 10 some degree over Ihe pISl However, 
it is not happening now .... 

The second idea I bad... [concerns] the 
events the ASUCSD [pull on) .... Theae arc 
events such as Sun God, WmterFesc, TGe and

we have done in the past. and I would like to 
expand what we do in the future. Spocifically,l 
have spoken wilil several administrators, and il 
seems 10 be poasible for us 10 do ~n II}.

That's a very diffICUlt question 10 answer, 
and the reason· is, when you have a big show 
like Sheryl Crow, the oost of pulling on lhose 
types 0( shows is tremendous. In tenns of se-
alrity, in tenns of facilities, in tenns of tech .... 
Typically, when we have a group of thai size 
coming 10 UCSD, it's because the promoICr has 
borne \hose costs, with the effect being that the 
student tickel prices an: higher. If the ASUCSD 

I'd also I ike 10 see the creation of an out-
reach offICe .... A.S.'s sole commitment so far 
10 outreach has been the creation last year of 
Ihe outreach. A lot of other campuses have 
formed offices devoted to outreach. UCLA 
started a program this year called Focus, which 
is a student-run retention program, which is 
whall'd like 10 see established on this campus. 
I think there 's a definite need for it. We would 
have I program thai addresses the needs of re-
tainingstudenlS at UCSO. There is a huge drop-
oul rale of studenlS after Iheir first year of 
school, especially students of color. We'd work 
at ~taining lhem, doing intervention services, 
counseling, tutoring, pecrcounseling. which is 
definitely nccdcd .... 

I've also been working on gelling finan· 
cial aid for peer counselors .... il has been ex-
panded to having the peer c:lUnselors do out-
reach in Ihe community, in Ihe local high 
schools and the junior high schools with finan-
cial-aid staff. And though the financial- aid of-
fice is running inlO its own problems, there still 
is a IOC of financial aid available for very needy 
students, and that's something that people need 
10 know. A loe of parcnlS don't think they can 
send their children 10 school .. .. 

... 1?IcI' ......... ,.. .......... 

-Well, there's more. There arc the ones of 
accessibility and accountability of AS. "Aa:a-
sibi lity" meaning holding town meetin" on the 
larger issues and requiring officers 10 hold very 
visible public office hours .... Acoountability 
includes having the AS. meetin" televised on 
the UCSD cable network. llilink if AS. mem-
bers know thai students arc watching. they will 
be a lot more careful in what they do. Hope-
fully, you'd also have a few students who are 
actually interested in what's going on .... We also 
need to raise the level of fundina Ihal student 
organizations arc receiving. f think that far too 
much is going 10 A.S. this year. wue_,.. _ .., .u.,-

Programming gOI $1 50,000 Ihis year. I 
mean, they blew $2S,OOOon WinterFest.. .. A.S. 
has been throwing out all this money .... I' ve 
heard, actually, Ihal we'~ gelling a n:putation 
in the [uq system for being willing 10 fork out 
as much money as possible, which is really 
evident in that the groups thai we 've booked. 
We [sometimes] end up paying twice as much 
for them than oeher UCS. Because they know 
they'lI gel that kind of money rrom us, they ask 
for it straight off the bal... This is ridiculous. 
Also, a lot of money has gone inlO officer ser-
vices. Somelhing which has frustrated me a 101 
this year is we've defunded a loe of student or-
ganizations .. . and ye~ every week we have the 
oommissioner of operations and services come 
in and ask for more money for another new 
project and il wouldn't be questioned .... 

.............. "u. ...... 
..." 

were 10 ay 10 put 011 an evenllike IiIIl it would 
probmly break the bInk, in a sense .... With 
smaller bands, however, we have explored in 
the past charging 55 or $10 to have a Pubsbow, 
have something ()\Ier at the Price Center. Stu-
dents were not in favor of thai, understandably, 
of course. We've explo~d in the past chargina 
money for Sun God- we don 't think ii's fea-
sible and we would like 10 keep it a free COll-
om .. So, 10 answer your question, iI's some-
thina we need 10 explore. 

Okay, the third thing is I would like next 
year, durina Ihe winter time, a campus-wide 
program survey ... of the services the AS. pr0-
vides, specifically Ihe programming. This has 
been done tine times in UCSD', history: once 
in I CJ86 - il would be very simillr 10 this one. 
The second and third lime W15 for RlMAC and 
Price Center, detenninina what kind of facili-
ties they would be pullina on there. This would 
be a scientific survey. I would like to do it duro 
ing the winter time, so that newer students 
would get a chance 10 see what goes on durina 
Ihe fall. One problem dlat we have is that we 
haven't raised Ihe student 8C\ivity _ in sev-
eral years and 1\ the same time we've taken on 
far more raponsibililies, spent fir more money 
on our progrunmina events and opened up new 
aerviea and entcrpriaes .... Hopefully, it [the 
survey] would be scientific and it would be~­
peaIIbIe, IOIIICthina thai would give us IIIlIIX 
inltitWcml memory, JOIIICthilll that the AS. 
would be able to do in the futuR. 

.. ,......., ..... c ........... 
."..,feeet 

I would IdvocIIe raising it only if studenlll 
wanted to raise i~ t.sicaIly. 

11Ie tounh thi ...... is our affordIbIe 1Ious-
ina, 15 I wa,nt 10 elllUle Ihe implemenlltion of 
the Mesa lIouIiJI&IaIfordable bouIia& pIaa, and 
help ldvocalC the explllSion of Mesa alfcrd-
able houain&. 15 well as rcopeni .. the idea of 
"Super Singles" over lithe mudhut apartments. 

The fifth liIina is. .. next yrlr', alternative 
transportation. I've never had a car here at 
UCSD, so I'm pretty well versed in the bus 
schedule and the availability - or rather Ihe 
Ix.k of availability - of spaces for people to 
ride their bites. I've been told Ihe lack of 
bikeways has been because ... they arcn 't in-
duded in the Master Plan. Well, the Master Plan 
is wrong. A lot of studenlS bike 10 UCSD in 
what I would consider incndibly unsafe con-
ditions, specifically on Regent's Road .... I've 
never seen [this issue) addressed since I've been 
at UCSD and it needs 10 be directed soon or 
else someone is going to get seriously hurt, as 
well as the studenlS' abilily 10 get around this 
campus quickly on bikes. ... The other thing I'd 
like 10 talk aboUi is the expansion of the bus 
lines. Cunendy, the bus lines don't go ... 10 Uni-
versity City or Del Mar, whe~ a loe of studenlS 
live or visit The availabilily of free bus passes 

campus knows who their AS. reps an:.

First of all, AS. meelings are not going to 
be held in lhe Student Leadership Chambers 

anymo~ on the third Ooor of Price Cenler. 
They'~ going 10 move from campus 10 cam-
pus - one in Muir one week, one in Revelle 
the nexl week. 

The second thing is televising on, you 
know, something like the co-op vote. Noe only 
would it make the process and representatives 
more accessible to studenlS, but it would hold 
the representatives more accountable. I think 
thaI's a loe of the problem this year. I goe really 
frustrated with this year's council. I saw the way 
they were voting on things, especially lOward 
the funding. They made a few kind of screwed 
up decisions. And then, instead of... voting dif-
ferentthe nextlime,lhey said, "Well, we've sel 
this preccdcn~ and il may he screwed up, but 
we've gollO keep on doing tha~" and it's like, 
if people we~ watching, they wouldn't be gel-
tina away with that .... 

WIIct_ .. ,... '.llcla .... U 
........ , 

God, just everything. They defunded Cul-
ture Quest from the executive budget this year. 
as well as studenl organizations and student 
organization travel. A loe of different things. 
Especially on the issue of travel... everyone 
has had trouble getting lravel money, and yet 
when Ihe Greek organizalions yelled and 
screamed and-having a loe of people on this 
year's council who are Greek - they gOf il. 
It's just ridiculous. I was really angry because 
I came inlo thai same meeting and requested 
$ I ,000 for 20 people to go 10 the UC Student 
SummilS. The Greeks had ~quested - God, 
what was it? Like ()\Ier $2,000 for four people 
10 go to a conference. The two were equated 
-I think they gave me $200 10 gel 20 people 
10 Ihe summi~ and the Greeks ended up get· 
ting a large chunk of whllthey lISted for. The 
AS. said, "Well, we cut them, too," and I said, 
"Bu~ I mean, this is the UC Studenl Summi~ 
this is iI ..... " It·s just very self-serving in Ihal 
poople representing their own groups are for-
getting that - and I'm not using anyone per-
son - senators are there to represenl their 
oolleges, not 10 represent any group Ihat Ihey 
may belong 10. Our slale [LEGAliZE II), I 
Ihink it is very representative of differenl 
people acra;s campus. 

When I've been asked by studenl organi-
zalions what's different about us, I think thai 
it's we are not associated with one group of 
people where that's the group of people that is 
goinglOgelailthe funding, thai weare outthe~ 
for all students, thatlhere is not going 10 be any 
kind of special treatmenl for anyone. We're just 
JOiIll 10 try 10 maximizz the fundina for every-
one, ay to <10 things f~ all people . 

Monday, April 10, 1995 , .

i~ .. [in]1rIIIIporWion COIII. ... 

One way \bey we can dolhia [1IIIke 15 many 
lranspOrtaIion opcions availmtc to studenlll) ... 
is 10 have a representative on Ioca1 city coun· 
cils. Thi' is somethina that [UC) Davis has 
looked into and ICIUaIly had in the past, and 
it's been quite effective for them.h helps them 
foster a sense of community, especially in this 
community which, I feel , is not especially re-
ceptive 10 student issues. Having I non-votina 
n:praentative on the city council would give 
studenll thc opportunity 10 voice lheir view. 
on housina isllues and lranIportation issues, 
specifically those issues liIat direclly alJect stu-
delllll' lives II UCSD .... 

The sixth thina I want to talk about a liale 
bit is IlUdent-goYemmentllXlCllibility. This is 
IIIlIIXthina thai people brilll up I lot and it', 
JOIIICthing that is prot.bly the hardest thina for 
us 10 00. .. partK:ularly in lil/lt of the iJla'Cdible

thing I would do as president is ... appoint an 
individull to serve as the AS. Reauitment Of-
ficer. This Recruitment Ofticer', IOIe job wouId 
be to go OUIIO thc commWlity, to the different 
student OIpIizationl, studenI.aci1lionl, and 
Sludent governments, and 10 haw a workina 
knowJed&c of all the dilkrcnt aovemmcnll aI 
UCSD and different wlYi of gettina involved 
and ... othe~ in aelti .. involved. This ill 
_y 10 iacorponte a lot of ditfiart IIudeuII. 
'lndilionally, this job of reauilment bas been 
placed upon our pubIic-~lations depIrtmcnI. 
which has a lot of other r.ponsibilities. 11Ie 
other individual dlat typically has had the job 
oC JeCnlitment is me, the vice prelidenl8dmin-

public-reilliona depll1lllCnt is quite limited 10 
unfonunIIcly recruitment bas like. a t.cbeaI 
to a lot of other;-. This rmes a real cr-
lion of cmlibility with repnll to UCSD .... 
There arc people on liIis <:IIDpIII that arc IlOl 
beina represented by their senalon. This is just 
a flagrantiack of credibility from the AS. and 
somethina we need 10 address direclly .... 

................... u.-..t 
We've done IiIII in a ooupIe of ways. The 

first way is we've held several evenlS here on 
the UCSD campus ... [which] gave us an 0p-
portunity to give them some information aboul 
the AS. Council, aboul the college councils 
and about different ways aboul getting in-
volved at UCSD .... We're trying 10 get the 
services of the AS. oul there so thai people 
know ... Ihal a) we're lhere 10 help them and 
b) they can help and help studenlS get in· 
volved, as well. As far as the second way that 
we've helped sludents OUI is Ihrough our 
Counselor Council. We've made it very easy, 
through changes in our committee struclu~ 
as well as changes in lhe council, for sludenlS 
10 come and adjusl the council. 

[is) forming a presidenl's cabinel with mem-
bers of differenl COf'oStituencies on campus sit-
ting on it and having them set an agenda, hav-
ing someone come 10 me and say, "I represent 
this group of people and they really want 10 see 
this issue addressed, you need 10 address this." 
The cabinet would playa loe more than an ad-
visory board, they would aaually be selling my 
agenda. Also, it is a way for me 10 find OUI what 
people wanl, you know, to be able re late 10 
people on a one·\OsOOe level, have weekly meel-
ings wilh them, have them be able 10 go back

A big one is actually taking a look at how 

the reg fees are being sel on this campus. I've 
had a couple things come 10 me Ihrough the 
grapevine this year, such as the cutting of work-
study sludenlS in lhe financial aid offKlC, which 
is making the financial aid peer counselor sys-
tem that much harder 10 implemen~ because it 
was. going 10 be staffed by work-slUdy srudenlS. 
Just the qualily of care that people are receiv-
ing from the Health Cenler, Career Services, 
how lhe money is being spent - things like 
thal There was that whole lillie scandal - I 
don't know if you were aware of this just last

able housing on campus. After being 
thrown a number of administrative and 
fiscal obstacles, the AS, tinally pushed 
through UCSO's first affordable:hoUSs 
ing program at MesaApartments just this 
quarter. Barnes says he wants to expand 
the efforl, which is currently in trial 
stages and only accommodates 120 
lucky sludents, to other UCSD resi-
dences such as the Mud Huts. 

In addition, Barnes says he wants 10 
make the A.S. more accessible to stu-
dents. He calls for more A.S. outreach 
events and says that if he is elected, he 
will appoint an A.s. outreach coordina-
tor to help inform sludents about coon: 
cil. Barnes also proposes a scientific, 
campus-wide survey to gauge student 

opinion on a variety of illlUeS. And like 
Falk, B~ promises bigger, beller, 
faster A.S. prognmming events. 

Barnes further highlighls alterative 
transportation, including putting bikes 
lanes on Regents ROId and throughout 
campus and setting up more bike rach 
In addition, he calls for providing free 
bus pages and improving buslines to and 
&om campus, issues he believes could 
be facilitated by putting non-voting stu: 
dent repesentatives on local city coon: 
cils. 

One of Barnes' most interesling 
ideas, however, is to conduct a study on 
campus:based student employment: 
how students ue hired and tired, what 
they ate paid relative to other schools, 
and whether the stills they Ieam ate PIp-
pi icable to their careers. In addition, he 
says he will push for greater utilization 
of tedUIology such as campus cable and 
Internet World Wide Web pep for the 
A.S. and studenl organizations to in-
aease oommunication. 

Though Barnes' servicesOriented 
goals separate him from Falk, the issue 
of greatest contention is autonomy. En-
dorsing what he calls a "statement of 
understanding." Barnes louis what res 
mains of the AS, autonomy propouI as 
an importanl step to "codify" the rela-
tionship between the AS. and the admin-
istration. During. GUDI'diIIn inllerview, 
he claimed that the document would give 
the AS_ Council the power to hire, fire 
and review ils staff, as well as set wages 
for A.S.sOpCrated businesses such as the 
Grove Cafe and Soft Reserves. However, 
the agreement would do nothing of the 
sort - the chancellor would have over: 
sight and final veto powers over A.s. 
"decisions." Atllest, theA.S. would have 
an expanded role as an advisory board. 
This issue curs 10 the heart of the presi-
dential election because, in many ways, 
it highlights the weaknesses and liabili-
ties of both candidates. While Barnes 
seems particularly will ing to sell students 
short by playing "Mr. Nice Guy" to the 
administration, Falk's battle cry to 
launch a lawsuif against the administra-
tion seems a bit knee jerk. Despite her 

The UCSD Guardian 

claim that legal COlIs could be defrayed 
by hiringACW-type lawyers pro bono, 
it's n.ive to think that such litigalion 
would not aippIe the AS. financially, 
at leut in the ahort term. And while 
Barnes seems somewhat unconcerned 
with the larger issues facing students to-
day, F.lt seems to focus .IFIlOIt exclu-
sivelyon them. Falk's ties to the UCSA 
ue extensive and there is cause for 00II: 

cern that these ovcrreac:bing issues could 
overshadow SIIIIller but more practical 
goals. 

\tJters face a difficult choioc, to be 
sure, On ba1ancc, however, we believe 
that FaIt is the best candidale, Her big: 
gest "negative" - her proclaimed in: 
lenl to sue the administration to pin au: 
Jonomy - would, as a practical matter, 
be adequately held in check. by the rest

of council, However, her deep CIOJICcrJI 
with critical student issues, her willing-
ness to tight when necessary Ind her 
desire 10 radically c:bange the ethos of 
the council makes her a oompelling 
dIoioe. Astrong student advocate, Falk's 
administration would be a far Wi from 
AS. business as usual. 

For these reasons, we endorse Naomi 
Falk in her bid for A.S. president.

By running for Muir College Iunior 
Senator. I hope to make a big differ: 
ence on the UCSD campus and for 
Muir college in three significant ways. 
First, I hope to provide better commu: 
nications between the students and the 
administrators. Second, I propose to 
provide students with more entertain: 
ing activities on campus_ Finally,l also 
hope to make Muir college the best 
college on the UCSD campus. AI: 
though my job is minimal and mot 
very powerful, I will always tty to keep 
the students interests intact. If elected 
as Muir College Iunior Senator, I will 
always keep the students' interests in 
mind when voting or making decisions 
in the Muir College Council.

attention,let me tell you what I'm ga-
ing to do. Do you find yourself be-
hind in classes with no way to (legally) 
unwind? Why nol bring a football 
team to UCSD, and unite all of the 
oolleges in a social, non-academic at-
mosphere? My plan for Sophomore 
Senator is to work in bringing the stu-
dent body logether wilh numerous ac-
tivities while taking into consideration 
the fee hikes and lack of funding that 
we get. I will work to keep the fees 
low and the fun high. Go out and

Do you support the increase 0/ 
the StuJentActivity Fee by $6.50? 

Vote "yes." The breakdown of 
this fee is as follows: 

• $4.50 for A.S. programming, 
student organizations and College 
Council programming and activities 

• 52.00 for a student-run reten-
tion program 

The organizations which the 
$4.50 would benefit could certainly 
use the money to students' advan-
tage, and establishing a student-run 
retention program is certainly 
needed. Such a program has a great 
potential for helping- students stay 
in school - particularly first-year 
minority students, who historically 
have a high drop-out rate from 
UCSD. Students would be more 
likely to come to other students with 
their problems, rather than contact-
ing academic advisors who are of-
ten intimidating and removed from 
the student experience. In addition, 
UCSD studentS could go to high 
schools to give information about 
opportunities to attend the univer-
sity, such as financial aid.
