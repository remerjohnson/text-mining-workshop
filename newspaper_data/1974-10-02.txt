Fourth College Fosters Writing Ability 
by V~lerie Girud 

Fou rth College 's writing 
program, one of the principle 
requ irments of the new college, is 
designed to create in students a 
writing profic iency that high 
schools and other colleges may 
neglect. The requirement was 

included last year as a result of 
dissatisfaction over the writing 
quality of UCSD students. 

The director of the proaram is 
Lowry Pei, a Harvard waduate 
who is currently finishin" his PhD 
In English from Stanford after 
laving taullht a year of writin" at 
the University of Missouri . 

Pei desi"ned the course himself 

after examining other writing 
programs, including the one 
quarter requirement at Third 
College. Principle goals of the 
writing program are to teach the 
student to write material that 
generates public interest. Pei 
feels that writing can be "exci ting 

if a c lass can share the task of 
learning to write better." 

The course will cover narration 
before moving into more 
analytical writing . Pei also hopes 
to live students time to work 
extensively on one topic . 

Pei has submitted a proposa I 
for funds to publish material in a 
class quarterly, ~ivinR students an 

opportunity to see their material 
in print. A few students from 
other colleges have inquired 
about the course, and Pei stated 
that if enough people show in-
terest, the course might even-
tually be opened to other 
students . 

4th Meeting 
Fourth College will hold two 
organization~1 meetings today 
and tomorrow to set up a college 
government. The meetings are 
scheduled for noon today and 
6:30 p.m. tomorrow in order to 
attract both resident and off-
campus students. 

Jenny Mun~y, Fourth College 
De~n, will he~d the meetinRs. 
Fourth's polentWiI govemment 
will be discussed and the v~rious 
committees open to students will 
be ~nnounced. 

Most of the positions will be 
appointed by the Fourth ColieRe 
Provost Office for this year. 
Althouah a committee will be 
chosen to set up the structure of 
the government, it is known that 
student .presentatives will be 
chosen to serw on the bec:utive 
Committee that deals with 
academic .ffain. 

was estimated at $2,000. 
Another proposal, endorsed 

by .the publiCity' comm ittee, was 
to publ ish a news letter to be 
circulated before each meeting 
in an effort to encourage 
student partiCipation and to 
allow students an opportunity to 
preview topics scheduled on the 
meetings agenda. 

Members of the co-op an-
nounced that a comprehensive 
research team is in the process 
of being formed in order to 
study and determine co-op 
housing possibilities for UCSD. 
The study is composed of ten 
students and is headed by Ben 
CiIl 

Coast Cruiser 
A plea of help was brought 

before the co-op in request for 
additional funds for the Coast 
Cruiser, the university oriented 
bus line operating between the 

orth County communities and 
U(SD. I t was proposed at the 
meeting that a petition be 
presented to Chancellor Will iam 
McElroy asking that fares be 

reduced to fifteen, or pOSSIbly 
ten cents, and that more bus 
service be established to and 
from North County. 

Student Affairs legal counsel 
Mark Bookman explained that 
the university's S9,000 subsidy 
to the Cruiser (paid from Parking 
Fines and Fortitures) carried a 
condition that the fair be raised 
to twenty-five cents . However, 
Bookman added that if S4,000 to 
$5,000 could be raised from 
other sources, possibly the 
Coop, that the fare could be 
dropped to last year's dime. 

There was also discussion of 
the recommendations of the 
Legitimacy Committee, which 
presented a report suggesting 
that the Coop move toward 
establishing " legitimacy of 
~ction and legitimacy of 

E
penness ." Rick Drom , a 
ember of the committee who 

pposed the report, sa:d he 
would indicate his opposition in 
a letter to the Chancellor. Drom 
would not release the letter to 
the Triton Times.

IPOLITICS: JAMES G. solol 

Lun~h Money 
Thi:; year more than any other in recent memory, the subject of 

money has assumed a prime position in poitical campaigns. Un-
fortuNitelv, some candidates have become obsessed with discussing 
ther opponents' money rather than the issues of the day. 

Edmund G. Brown Jr. began taling about Houston Flournoy's 
financial bickers even before his nomination in the June primaries. At 
a picnic for campaign workers last June, Brown claimed that Flournoy 
was heavay supported by Governor Reagan's so-caled "k itchen 
cabinet" of well-known and well-financed Republican money men. 
Although Flournoy has received some monies from the likes of Hpnry 
Salvatore and Holmes Tuttle, Houston Flournoy has been hard pressed 
to mount the type of campaign it takes to win a Califom ia election 
against a tough opponent such as Jerry Brown. 

Despite attempts by most to cut campaign costs to a min imum, the 
price tag on elections continues to rise. Califomia has become so large 
that regional campaign offices must be set up in los Angeles, San 
Francisco, and now San Diego. Each of these offices causes an 
enormous drain on the campaign coffers. Media costs continue to rise 
but these are necessary expenses if one hopes to win . One mailing to 
all Califomia voters would probably cost over 52 million and paper 
costs conti nueto rise even faster than the rate of inflation in the state. 
The logistical problems of traveling around a state so geographically 
large have also increased costs . 

Flournoy and Brown agreed ea rl ier in the campaign Â·to lim it their 
spendin g . The two candidates have kept, within the scope of their 
agreement. Houston Flournoy seems to have difficu ky even ap-
proachin g the limit. Still one gets the feeling that this year's guber-
natorial race, despite the good candidates, despite the issues raised, 
despite the contrast in political philosophies, has failed to com-
municare to the voters enough information to make a real campaign. 
In addition to general voter disinterest and abnormally poor media 
coverage, one of the major reasons for thiS failure has been a lack of 
money or limits on money to wage effective campaigns . 

Over the weekend staff members from the Triton T mes attended 
two poli tical functions deSigned to ra ise money for election cam-
paigns. last Friday night Representative Clair Burgener held a 5100 a 
plate dinner. Though there were no speeches in a true political sense, 
Congressman Burgener said that he realized it was difficult to ask 
people to pay 5100 for a campaign these days but that 421 people 
bought tickets. Out of those proceeds he would be able to finance his 
entire c ampaign . . 

Though i t would be difficult to presume that Burgener's opponent 
Bill Bandes can call a dinner and payoff his total expenses, Burgener 
can be complimented for trying to spread his campaign costs over a 
relatively large nunner of people in local races. Too many Republicans 
and Democrats receive their fu nd ing from a sma ll clique of financial 
backers . I n some cases there will be only two or three people funding a 
mub-mdl ion dollar state campaign. 

Satu Id ay, at the Richardson lu ncheon, the subject of money arose 
once more . H.l. Richardson said that In his campaign he has yet to ask 
anybody for money. Despite impressions to the contrary, Richardson's 
ca mpaig n has not had the active and staunch support of Republican 
fat cats who often associated with the COP.

of the resident dean, ground floor, Argo Hall. 

Revel e is ten years old this year, and the Dean's 
office feels that this is a good time to see "where 
things are going." 

Dean Mort, commenting on the increased 
popularity of living in dorms, views today's 
campus atmosphere as a " retum to the 
traditional." In an effort to improve UCSD's 
overa" appeal and effectiveness, improved 
facilities for the handicapped are being 
examined ... 

Among matters under consideration are im-
proved facil ities for commuter stu dents, including 
more lockers a.nd an off-campus resident center, 
designed to keep the commuller informed of 
campus events, respond to h IS needs and help him 
get his " money's worth ." Parking is a continuing 
problem, of course ...

Polo Team 
Drowns Pomona 

1M Leagues 
Still Forming 

by Bert lee 
Before a capacity and surprisingly vociferous crowd , the UCSD 

water polo team opened its season on an optimistic note as i t 
defeated Pomona College 6-4 Friday night in the home pool 

The Tritons, passing well , tallied the Initial score when Al iln O'Hern 
scored from close range (the first of four goals), in the fir~t quarter 
later in the second quarter, O'Hern scored again to give the Tritons a 
2-0 advantage at halftime. Despite the score, the Pomona team 
managed to get more shots off in the first half and the Tritons wou ld 
have been In trouble if it weren't for the spectacular play of goalie 
Bob Alei (pronounced all-ie), whose father's first name happens to be 
Mohammad, (honest) . Indeed, Bob himself exhibited the quick 
reflexes of another Mohammad Ali. 

The Pomona squad would not die (drown?), however, as it quickly 
scored a fter the Â· intermission to make it 2-1 . When UCSD was next 
penahzed, the Pomona squad was awarded a one man advantage, but 
the Tritons played beautiful defense to preserve the lead . UCSD then 
regained the momentum, and before a delighted audience, increased 
Its lead to 5-2, (O'Hern scoring twice more) . Corky (El Chunko) Hull 
was also Impressive during this stint with his good passing and 
powerful cannon-armed shots. 

Pomona made a brief run to cut the lead to 5-4, but then ran out of 
gas dnd lime as the Tritons hung on to win . 

Coach Gary Becker was extremely pleased with the AGGRESSIVE 
team play, (9 Trotons fouled out!) and the great work of the reserves. 

FOOTBALL 
Anyone wishing to sign up tor a 

men's or a coed flag football 
team , there is still time. Plenty of 
open dates remain on Saturday 
and Sunday. Bring your team 
roster to Harry Bloom in the Rec 
Gym . 

It has been a past policy to 
charge 1M football teams which 
forfei t games, a forfeit fee 
equivalent to the cost of the 
referees for the game. Teams not 
paying the fee were not allowed 
to participate further . 

This year, there will not be a 
forfeit fee. If for some reason a 
team is unable to playa game on 
a particular date or time, it is still 
expected that the team will notify 
the 1M office (452-4038) 24 hours 
prior to the game. Hopefully each 
team will feel enough of a sense 
of responsibility and con -
sideration to make any kind of a 
forfeit fee unnecessary. I Women Spikers: "Unbeatable" 

by Dave Elsen 
Women's volleyball has added a new wrinkle 

this season and with it cou ld very possibly be the 
team's third consecutive San Diego Women's 
I nterco lIegiate Ath letic Conference cham-
pionship. 

Th'e 1974 season will be only the third in 
existence for women's intercollegiate volleyball at 
UCSD, but if Coach Chuck Millenbah's strategy 
pays off, the Tritons will have another title. 

According to Millenbah, " I believe that this 
team is smart enough to use the difficult 6-0 
offense instead of the simpl ified 4-2 pattern that 
we've used the past two years . If we play together 
and p ss well, I'm sure we'll be unbeatable." 

Millenbah is entering his eighth year of 
coaching, and among his recent accomplishments 
was the heading of UCSD's nationaJ men's 
volleyball champions in 1970. 

Returni ng from the 1973 squ'td are tup players 

including captain Susan Papanek, Andrea Beylen, 
Susan Tusch, Margi Schwartz, Tina Flammer, Ellen 
O'Rorke, and Holly Stewart. Ella Ljungwe is rated 
hi ghest among the new prospects, who include 
Teresa Duquette, Susan Hannahs, Wen Chi Ho, 
Joan Roberts, Cathy Horimoto, and Diane 
Dougherty. Other team members are Amy linden, 
lisa Neely, Judy Otero, Teresa Ryan, Vera Torp, 
and lori Bonesteel. 

Coach Millenbah is assisted by his travelling 
secretary Kathy Davis. The head coach com-
mented, " Red (Davis) is really doing an out-
standing job keeping the girls in line." The squad, 
under the leadership of Millenbah and Davis, 
practices daily, from 4-5 :30 pm, and everyone is 
welcome to come out and watch the women 
beginning Monday, September 30. 

The Triton regular season starts at home Oc-

version lIersus the basketball 
version of the aquarian game, 
polo has now replaced basketball 
as the fall sport in the pool. For all 
those who have teams or are 
putting a team together there will 
be a captain's m eeting today 
(Oct. 2) at 4 pm in the Rec Gym 
Conference Room .

European Handball Invades UCSD 
by Dirk Slaker 

What's the fastest moving action at UCSD besides the cu te blond 
in your O-{:hem lab with the nicest pair of ea'rs that you've eller seen? 

To gille you a clue, it's one of the numerous intramural sports those 
friendly people down at the Rec reation Office bring us each year. 
Well, it's not football , or basketball , or even inner-tube polo, but a 
strange cross between all three With a dash of floor hockey and 
soccer for favor. What is it you .ask? Wf]y noth ing other than 
European handbal l. 

You're probably saying by now that this writer has either been 
hallucinating after eating in the cafeteria or smoking something else 
in his pipe besides Borkum Riff. Handball is a game you play by 
slapping a small rubber ball against concrete walls. This is, however, 
American handball. 

European handball is a game played by throwin" it leather ball, 
smaller than a volleyball yet larger than a sOnDall, IIltO a soccer-styie 
net , But ifs not alwayS as easy as it appears. 

In most cases, mere will be seven players on the opposing team 
jumping up and down, trying to pr~ent you from scoring. Three are 
known as forwards, three as guards, and filially the ever-alert goalie. 
The only difference between the forward and guard positions is that 
the forward is relied upon mainly for scoring. However, both forwards 
and guards play offense and defense, depending on who controls the 
ball. 

Like bask~ball, the whole team is in constant motion, except for 
the goalie, who must remain in the goal area, The goal area itself is 
restricted to both offense and defense alike, and violation of this 
results in a penalty. 

There are very few penalties, and those that are called are similar 
to the ones in basketball, with the exception of offsides. In minor 
offenses, the ball is given to the other team for an ind irect freethrow. 
'!hose penalt,d that the referee deems major infractions, such as 
lIiolently striking the ball away from an opponent, result in a penalty 
shot for the opposing team . Body contact is kept limited; howeller, as 
in any Quick sport, it i$ often unavoidable. 

As in basketball, the ball is moved by nribblinll and passing. A 

player may dribble the ball as long as he or she desires and is forced 
to pass it only if the ball is held without dribbling. If this occurs, the 
player can take either three steps or hang onto the ball for three 
seconds, at whi ch time It must be passed . 

A player may dribble with one hand, two hands, a head, or any part 
of the body above the knee Along the same line, the ball may be put 
Into the goal with any part of the body above the knee . For instance, 
a common way to score IS to throw the ball into the air and spike it 
With the hand, as In volleyball. A score is only possible if your op-
ponent IS wll.llng, and only In the goal area, behind the net or in any 
other comfortable location . 

Games will be held In the Rec Gym and w ill consist of two running 
time halves, with a five minute half time break. Teams will be coed, 
(refer to last line of preceding paragraph.) and if the wome" .are 
anything like thosewho participated in floor hockey, the compet ition 
should be stiff. For answers to any further questions, see Harry in the 
Rec Office. 

Captain's meeting will be on October 4th at 4 pm. 

Tritons Kick A 
The UCSD Varsity Soccer team 

opened the season With a 
resounding 3-1 victory over 
Pepperdine University Coach 
Stewart Hayes was pleased with 
the performance of hiS team. 

The Tritons opened the scoring 
on a thrOW-in to Alfonso Gon-
zalez from Brad Perry. Gonzalez 
headed the ball to Carlos Robles 
who headed the ball into the 
goal Pepperdlne came back and 
tlPel the score, but from then on 

the play was dominated by UCSD. 
Charlie Webster garnered the 

second goal for the Tritons with a 
hard shot that glanced off a 
defender and into the goal. Dave 
Youngdale closed out the scoring 
easily when a pass across the 
mouth of the Pepperdlne goal 
caught the goalie out of poSition . 

The team will be in actIOn this 
weekend, as they compete in The 
San Diego State Invitational

u.s. and Cuba Should He-establish Ties 
BY FRANK MANKIEWICZ 

Fidel Castro believes, and with some 
justification, that the shade of John Foster Dulles-
with all his anti-Communist fervor-haunts 
American policy toward Cuba. But even the late 
secretary of state might want to change our Cuban 
policy now. After all, Dulles was always seeking 
"situations of stibility" in the world, and, as Castro 
pointed out rece"tly, Cuba has the most stable 
government in the Western Hemisphere. Castro 
made that statement about stability to an 
American visitor in July and he added, with only a 
slight smile, " including, I believe, yours." 

There is no question in my mind that American 
policy toward Cuba needs to change. It resembles 
at present nothing so much as one of those 
fascinating folk festivals held by ancient tribal 
societies, in which the characters act out a drama 
complete with masks and costumes, but the 
origins of whichflo living observer can describe or 
even recall . 

Our Cuban policy over the years has changed 
somewhat, but only in the sense that our hostility 
has become inactive and static . The policy 
originally was only unreasonable; now, it is ac-
tually counterproductive. It began, of course, with 
active counterrevolutionary intervention at the 
Bay of Pigs. Thereafter, the continuing political 
ignorance of the military.<:IA complex having 
been once more exposed, the policy returned to 
ordinary subversion-such as early crude attempts 
at the "destabilization" of Cuba that were later to 
prove "successful" in Allende's Chile . Raids along 
the coast, the planting of agents, frustrating the 
replacement of spare parts-that sort of thing. 

By the mid 1960'5, even this milder form of 
direct intervention had tailed off, to be replaced 
by nothing much stronger than oratory. 

What are the main elements of our Cuban 
policy, which President Ford now says depends 
upon our faithful adherence to the majority view 
of our partners in the Organization of American 
States? Generally speaking, there are six-all bound 
together in what Cubans call " the blockade." 

-No direct trade-or indirect , for that matter-
between the United States and Cuba . This means 
that a manufacturer of can-cutting machinery (or, 
for that matter, of lightbulbs)who wants to sell to 
Castro-at any price, on any terms-cannot. It also 
means that he cannot sell to a third country buyer 
who would then transship the merchandise to 
Cuba. 

-No country which receives economic aid or 
credit from the United States may trade with. 
Cuba, under pain of losing the American largesse. 
There have been a few exceptions to this poli(:y, 
either in the interests of old alliances or just plain 
sanity. 

-No ship which has called at a Cuban port may 
then call at an A!'lerican port . This is obviously a 
major source of strength of the blockade, and 
accounts for the presence of a lot of ships with 
strclnge flags in Havana Harbor. 

.<:uba is, of course, excluded from the OAS and 
other hemispheric groupings. This does about as 
much damage to the Castro government as would 
being e(duded from the Aqua-Velva After Shave 
Club, a,d Castro himself has no desire to rejoin 
the Ol-S

price o ' sugar has skyrocketed recently and it has

anyway, which is just as well . tor years, we 
assigned tonnages to differEnt ugar-producing 
countries and bought their su~:ar at a price above 
the world price. This was dont' for two reasons-to 
make U.S. beet sugar competitive domestically 
with cane, and after a while it was done because it 
had become a lucrative program to the lob-
byist/congressional complex which controlled the 
quotas. 

-There is, of course, no diplomatic contact Â· 
between the two countries, which means U.S. 
citizens in Cuba must be represented by another 
embassy-in this case, the Swiss-and there is no 
direct travel between the U.S. and Havana. 

That is, more or less, the U.S. policy toward 
Cuba, but no one can explain why . Cuba has long 
since ceased to "export revolution ," if it ever did . 

If there is one thing Cuba has exported suc-
cessfully, it is not revolution but its domestic 
opposition-hundreds of thousands of Cubans left 
voluntarily (and with the consent of the 
revolutionary government) and came to the 
United States during the 1960's . One result is 
virtually unanimous support for the government 
from the people now in Cuba. 

There will b~ short run and long run advantages 
to a swift change in our relations with Cuba. First 
of all, a recognition of reality is always helpful. It 
makes you look less foolish in the eyes of others 
who cin the samp 

In aadition, tor the long haul , there are lessions 
to be learned from the Cuban Revolution . For 
example, there is in Havana what is 
unquestionably the very best psychiatric hospital 
anywhere in Latin America, created since the 
revolution . In connection with a TV special, I 
traveled throughout Cuba for nearly four weeks in 
July, and during that time did not see one shoeless 
child or one child with the classic signs of 
malnutrition . Cuba now has the lowest infant 
mortality rate of all Latin American nations 
illiteracy is practically nonexistent, and by ~ 
shrewd concentration of resources in the 
countrYSide-where the great majority of 
development has taken place.<:astro has avoided 
the terrible problem of almost every developin~ 
country, namely the flight of hundreds of 
thousands to the capital city . As a result, Havana 
is t he only Latin capita l I have seen whlch does 
not have the typical ring of shantytown misery 
surrounding it. 

What it does have is a government free of 
corruption, with the support of people who live 
there, whose economy appears to be stable and 
indeed is growing without our assistance. Not only 
is there no reason to continue our present policy, 
there is every reason to change it. 

What should the United States do? It should 
unilaterally end the blockade . After that, hard 
negotiation with Castro and other Cubans would, I 
am convinced, quickly dissolve any remaining 
differences in a manner fair to both sides. The 
diplomatic process will be slow, and properly so, 
but it should begin . Richard Nixon is no longer 
President of the United States; we should also 
face the reality that John Foster Dulles is no longer 
secretary of state. 
Frank Man~iewic%, whose article is reprinted 
from the Los Angefes Times, was press 
secretary to Robert F. Kennedy and George 
McGovern. He recenlly had a 2J-hour in -
terview with Fidel Castro for a television 
documentary . 

Coast Cruiser: UC 
Owes H To Students 

BY JONI MOODY 
The Coast Cruiser is a 

University funded bus line that 
provides transportation between 
the University and northern 
coastal communities, and is 
neccessitated by the fact that no 
other form of mass transit exists 
within this region. Operating in 
1973-1974 with funds from the 
Undergraduate Student Activity 
Fee, the Del Mar City Council, the 
Friends of Del Mar and daily 
fares, the Coast Cruiser ended the 
year with a huge deficit, resulting 
in a controversy between 
University officials and students 
over the means for finanCing this 
years program . 

Upon request for funds from 
students, Vice Chancellor H .0 . 
Johnson proposed a plan in which 
the Cruiser is subsidized by 
Parki ng Fines and Forfeitures if 
students are charged 25 cents per 
ride Distressed over the fare 
increase, students are now asking 
for additional funds and fare 
reduced to 15 cents. University 
officials have responded with the 
argument that passengers should 
assume some of the burden of 
pr ice increa.ses needed to con-
tinue operation of the Coast 
Cruiser. 

The Universi ty can, in fact, 
justifiably support their position 
of refusing to support or subsidize 
non -academic activities per-
taining to student welfare. Ac-
cording to the University, its ideal 
and principle function is to 
promote independent thought 

such as the Cout Crui5er is not 
implicit in the role of the 
University, and students should 
not e~ct the University to 
adopt a paternalistic platfonn 
l'egarding student affairs. What 
the student should expect from 
the University is an education 
and if the student feels th~ 
University is not meeting its end 
of the bargain made when the 
student pays his fees, then and 
only then does the student have 
grounds for complaint. 

Fortunately, the student-
University relati.onship is hardly 
as barren as implied in the 
principal function of the 
University . Personal, experience 
has proved that the majority of 
University officials are com-
passionate, dedicated people 
who try to anticipate student 
needs and are willing to listen and 
respond to student requests for 
flexibil ity within the University. 

So too, is the University 
sympathetic to requests for 
financial support, and the Coast 
Cruiser situation is representative 
of this fact. Although the offer to 
subsidize the Cruiser with S9000 
of University money provtded 
students pay an additional 10 
ce nts for fares is felt by many to 
be exceSSi vely detrimental to 
student finances , It must be 
remembered that the University is 
not compelled to provide or 
subsidize transportation to North 
County at all. 

and individuals who choose to Nev rthless, as requests for 
assume the task of answering the additional funds for the Cruiser 
many diff icult questions and are now being propo ed, the 
problems plaguing man . If the UniverSity should conSider re-
university succeeds in ac- eval uating fund allocation for the 
complishing this function, have Coast Cru Iser based on the In -
they not done enough for creased frequency of student use 
students and satisfied their role in of th e Cru iser and the fact that 
society? hitch-hikin g multiplies when 

The answer is Yes. Providing alternative means of tran-
addition funds for student needs sportation become too expensiv~.

You are about to r('ad a fab le. Let your mind run Irpe, let your 
imagination take you where it will. Enjoy yourself In a harmless fan-
tasy . 

Imagine, if you will , a petri dish with patches of bacterial growth . 
Picture this.blob as having, somehow, a certain level of consciou ness, 
of rationality, of thought . Think of it as making decisions as to where to 
spread to next, about when cells divide, about what to feed upon. 

Imagine if you will a petri dish with patches of edible matter 
separated by patches of an anti-bacterial agent. Imagine our 
mysterious substance as spreading out over the edible portions, thinly 
at first, then growiRg large colonies at the more tasty spots. 

Imagine our substance somehow learning to use the inedible por-
tions of the petri dish. Perhaps building bridges over rivers of the anti-
bacterial agent, or shelters to avoid the occasional blasts of a 
chemistry student's bad breath. . 

Imagine each cell as having a consciousness, a consciousness that 
merges with the others when they join; a large blob has many cells but 
only one consciousness, Imagine it developing an internal structure, a 
nervous system, first through direct contact and later through a more 
sophisticated relay system . 

Imagine our substance as learning to devote some portions of itself 
exclusively to some tasks, such as bridge building, while other parts 
gather food . 

Imagine it building ships to cross the anti-bacterial oceans, roads to 
;Iow-nutrition areas, and even extending a feplpr outside the petri dish.
