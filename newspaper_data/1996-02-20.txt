UCB Sex Ed Study 
Refute. Statu. Quo 
BERKELEY, Calif. - A 
recently released study by two 
UC Berkeley professors 
indicates that participants in 
sex-education programs are 
more likely to usc birth' control. 
According to public policy 
A!>sistant Professor Jane 
Mauldon, femaJes were eight 
percent more likely to use 
contraception during their first 
sexual experience if they had 
taken a sex-education course. 
The study was based on the 
statistical analysi of a 1988 
survey of American women. 
'''The tudy seems to go against 
the conventional wisdom that 
sex education doesn't work," 
Mauldon aid.

MISSOULA, Mont. -
Officials have given up the 
search for Ryan Cross, a 
University of Montana student 
who fell into an irrigation 
channel Feb. 10. Cross was la t 
seen when he and his friend, 
Carrie Thompson, were waJking 
on an ice-covered irrigation 
channel near the campus. 
Thompson said Cross walked to 
the center of the ice and stepped 
into a hole which appeared to 
have knee-deep water nowing 
beneath it. The ice shelf on 
which Cross was standing 
collapsed, dropping him into the 
10-foot-deep water below. 
Search efforts will resume in a 
few weeks when officials say 
the body will have built up 
enough natural gas to Iloat.

MONEY: Measure on spring 
ballot would primarily fund 
sports organizations 
By Esther Yoon 
StaffWnter 

UCSD students might be asked to pay 8.50 
more per year to fund athletic anQ A.S.-sponsored 
activi ties, if a student-activity fee referendum is 
voted through on the spring A.S. election ballot. 

Ajoint fcereferendumof$29.50perquaner -
sponsored by intereollegiate athletics, sport club 
and intramural programs-would allocate $20 to 
intercollegiate athletics, $3 to sports club ', $2 to 
intramuml program and $4.50 to the A.S. 

The$4.50allocatedtotheA.S. wouldbesupple-
mentary to (he $13.50 which ·tudents already pay 
the A.S. quarterly for campus activi ty fees. 

Aside from increasing funding for the A.S., the 
referendum aims to "bring UCSD's intercolle-
giate athletics to the same level as other DiviSIOn 
U1 chOoI.,", ccording to RevellcscnlOranu sports-
club participant Devon Shea. 

The referendum would al 0 eliminate entry 
fees paid by intramural sports team~ and upgrade 
budgets for intercollegiate, spons-c1ub anu intra-
mural programs. 

Based on an estimated Muden! population of 
15,000, Sheacalcl.llated that the referendum would 
bring an additional $1.2 million per year from 
students to the sports programs. 

Budgets forintercollegiateathleticteams would 
be capped at $15,000 - the average amount for 
Division III teams, according to Shea. 

However, various members of the A.S. Coun-
ci l expressed disapproval of the $20 in funding for 
intercollegiate athletics. 

"Interco llegiate athletics are sponsoreu by the 
students ' registration fees," A.S. President aomi 
Falk said. "At this point, I feel that Ithe] A.S. 
should be separate from thi s referendum and aim 
at getting a $3.50 quarterly campus activity fee 
increase." 

3. An acoustic lens - a receiver using 
hydrophones - picks up the modified noise 
slgnats and sends the information to a 
computer, which processes It to create a

In addition, funds from the new fee would be 
used to improve staffing forthe training rooms and 
would bring coaches from part-time to full-time 
paid positions. Full-ti me coaches would (each

ment fees from students.

Credited with steering the UCLA 
campus through turbulenltimes and 
some of its greatest growth, UCLA 
Chancellor Charles Young has de-
cided to tender his resignation after 
27 years of dedicated service, effec-
tiveJune 30,1997. 

Young informed 
UC President Rich-
ard Atkinson of his 
decision in a Febru-
ary 14 letter, after 
"considerable 
thought and reflec-

several weeks." 

Young also 
wrote that he and his 
wife decided that the 
time had come for 
them "to pursue the 
next chapter of 
[theirllives." 

Research Coonci I iankings as "a ful-
fillment of that dream." UCLA was 
ranked third-best among the nation's 
universities for its 31 Ph.D . programs. 

Alsoduring his tenure as chancel-
lor, Young raised UCLA's operating 
budget from $170 million in 1968 to 
the $1.7 billion of today. He helped 

UCLA become a 
top university not 
only in academics, 
but in research, the 
arts and intercolle-
gille spans as well. 

Young's influ-
enceon UCLA was 
enormous, accord-
ing to UCLA Un-
dergraduate Stu-
dents' Association 
President York 
Chang. 

In response to 
Young's leiter, 
Atkinson said he 
was disappointed in 
Young's decision 
and thar it would be 
a great loss to the 
university.

UCOP Details Decline of Certain Minority Applications 
FIGURES: Minority 
applications drop 
slightly for 1996-97 
By Mary Hlglns 
Staff Writer 

A record number of high school 
seniors - 45 ,939 students - ap-
plied for admission to the UC sys-
te m for fall 1996, the UC Office of 
the President announced last week, 
although the number of minority 
applicants has declined within cer-
tai n ethnic groups. 

UCOP's report indicated that the 
5.9-percent increase in high school 
applicants is concurrent with a drop 
in applications from Chicanos, 
Latinos and American Indians. 

"[While) weare pleased with the 
overall increase in the number of 
undergraduate applications, we are 
concerned about the drop in the num-
bers of applications from Chicanos, 
Latinos and American Indians," UC 
President Richard Atkinson said. 

UCOP statistics indicated that 
only UCLA experienced increases 
in applications from the minority 

groups in question; although sev-
eral campuses, including UCSD, 
posted application increases from 
two of the three groups. 

The UCOP report indica ted that 
an overall decrease in applications 
to the smaller campu es by 
Chicanos, Latinos and American In-
dians resulted in systemwide appli-
cation declines of 2.6 percent, 1.4 
percent and 9.8 percent within these 
groups, respectively. 

UC Director of Undergraduate 
Admissions Carla Ferri said the re-
gents' July 1995 decision to end 
affirmative action is probably not 
responsible for the decrease of ap-
plicants from some minority groups. 

"Students and their families had 
probably made plans whether or nol 
to apply to the UC months before 
that decision was made," Ferri said. 
"Maybe one or two families were 
discouraged, but generally, this de-
cision is not related to this year's 
decline in certain minority-group 
applicants ... 

The University of California is 
not the only university to experi-
ence a drop in the numbers of appli-

ca tion s from certain minority 
groups . Other schools, including 
Stanford University, have shown 
si milar patterns of decline in the 
ethnic makeup of their applicants. 

UC officials said it is unclear 
why the numbers of applicants arc 
decreasing. 

"These figures are a snapshot of 
one year ... and one should not jump 
to conc lusions," UC Assistant Vice 
President forStudeni Academic Ser-
vices Dennis Galligani said. 

Galligani also said it would be 
impossible to pinpointadcfinile rea-
son for the decline due 10 the mul-
tiple factors which impact applica-
tion figures every year. 

Ferri agreed, saying that a defi-
nite pattern of decli ne cannot be 
based on one year's statistics. 

"This decline is something that 
has happened this year," she said. 
"One year does not make a trend. 
We need to look at it more deeply, 
long range: 

"[We are investigating this de-
cline) by looking at whether or not 
the studenls are coming from public 
or pri vate high schools," Ferri added.

PINION 

Can a Flat Tax Find a Way Through the 
United States' Tax Code Morass? 

n case you missed it, about a month ago 
former Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Jack Kemp held a press con-
ference to announce that his privately 
funded ad-hoc commission on tax reform 
had completed its work and was issuing a 

report. For the past year - at the be-
hest of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen-
ate Majority Leader Bob Dole -the commis-
sion had been hard at work developing poli-
cies suitable for replacing our current tax sys-
tem. In the end, the Kemp Commission's con-
clusions support the implementation of an 
across-the-board flat tax as a solution for our 
nation's fiscal quagmire. But before one can 
see the merits of a flax tax, one must first un-
derstand the pitfalls of our current lax system. 

And one doesn't have to be a conservative 
Republican to sec that the present way of rais-
ing revenue for the federal govemmentleaves 

much to be desired. Consider a few facts, cour-
tesy of the Kemp Commission's report : 

• The internal Revenue Code 'and its 
accompanying regUlations now 

take up nearly 10,000 pages. 
Thi s voluminous work 

Illustration by 
Alex Ahn 

doesn't even include the ever-increasing vol-
ume of tax-court opinions and reports needed 
to resolve mind-numbing ambiguities within 
the tax code. 

• In 1991, the non-partisar Tax Foundation 
estimated small corporal ions spent a minimum 
ofS382 in compliancccosts for every SIOO they 
paid in taxes. 

• The Internal Revenue Service estimates 
that for the 1995 tax year, businesses will have 
spent about 3.4 billion hours filling out 
tax-related paperwork. For the same 
period, private citizens will have 
spent 1.7 billion hours wrangling 
with their taxes. These 5.1 billion 
total hours are equi valent to 
three million people working 
full-time all year long, just to 
comply with current tax laws. 

The current tax structure 
is a prime example of a sys-
tem broken beyond repair; 
and reform or reinvention are 
impossible. This is why the

Theory and 
Reality 

The Guardian interviews Donald 
Bear, professor emeritus of economics 
at UCSD, about the viability of a flat 
tax in the United States. 
QUlJrdIan: Do many economist. support the Idea of a 
flat tax? 

Bear: I think as far as a flat tax in general is concerned, al-
most every economist would praise the fact lhalthe marginal 
rates [the rate of tax on the last dollar of income] on most tax-
payers would be lower under a flat tax than under the progres-
sive income tax we have today. 

Under a flat tax, there is a smilller wedge dri ven bet ween 
what the person buying the resource is paying and what the owner 
of a resource receives for the use of the resource_ The smaller the 
wedge, the less distortion there is in the market for resources. 
The lower the tax rate, the more likely a person will be willing to 
work. I think that is something almost ,III economists can agree 
upon, although I'm sure there are orne who won' t agree th.1t a 
flat tax is to be praised because it lowers marginal tax rates on 
owners of resources.

viding all non-essenllal employees 
with what amounted to a paid vaca-
lion. Politiclan~ on each Side of the 
budget battle screamed back and forth 
at each other - Democrats ahout 
"draCOnian spending Cllt~," and Re-
puhlicans aoout "cutt ing waste." 

Lost amid all the screaming and 
gnashing of teeth was the fact thaI 
neither side was endorSing any real 
change. Neither side was taking the 
k.ind of action necessary to repair a 
broken economic system. Nei ther side 
appears to realize that thc American 
people would be far beller off with a 
smaller, less burdensome government 
and more money gracing their pock-
etbooks. 

People have taken It for granted 
thai, going unchecked, government 
and spending always grow larger. 
Because close to two thirds of the to-
tal budget is comprised of entitle-
me nts whi ch arc automatica ll y 
ratcheted up, thi s assumpllon IS nol 
entirely off base. The haggling which 
occurs over the remainder o r the 
money, mainly ,oncerning where to 
waste It, is almost pointless. 

Even the language used to discuss 
the budget reflects Ihe assumption that

not Just another bland I;a ll for "re-
fo rm" of the system we have now. 
According 10 the report , the U.S. tax 
code "has seen 3 1 'Significant ' re-
forms and an astounding 400 addi-
tional ' revisions' through pub lic 
laws" in the la5t40 years. What Kemp 
and his supporters arc clamoring for 
is a revolution, plai n and simple. 

The collection of revenue to suffi-
ciently cover the costs of government 
is arduous enough. But the main de-
fects of the current system stem from 
our benighted expectations that taxa-
tion should achieve most of our so-
cial and economic goals. The bottom 
line is that we ask far too much of our 
tax system. These unreasonable ex-
peclations have prompted the tax , ode 
to grow dramati,ally in size and com-
plexity.

"draconian cuts" of lhe Republican~, 
which supposedly would have put the 
elderl y on the street and starved 
school children, and Clinton's kinder, 
gentler reductions, which wouldn't do 
anything at all , were ac tua lly in-
creases in spending. 

I nstead of the same tired SOCial-
Ism PUI forth by both parties as fisc al 
responsibility during the past debale, 
Americans rea lly need new policies: 
actual reductions in both government 
spending and taxation rales. The gov-
ernment has shown itself to be won-
derfully efficient at wasting money, 
getting in the way of pri vate industry 
-thus hurting employment fates and 
the standard of li ving - and turning 
ci tizens who would otherwise be pro-
ductive members of society into pau-
pers dependent on government hand-
outs to survi ve_ 

In terms of actually doing some-
thing constructive, the government is 
woefull y inept. Name one govern-
ment bureaucratic agency or program 
which has actually solved the prob-
lem il was created to combat. Cer-
tai nly many more examples come to 
mind where government so lutions 
onl y made their charged problem 
worse, making the phrase, ' 'I'm from 
the government . and (' m here to 
help," laughable at best. With such a 

For example, we ask that the lax 
code redistribute income from the rid! 
to the poor. Th is progressive taxation 
has been a spectacular failure. By 
mandating such a system, we confuse

We a l ~o want to encourage certain 
economic aCli vi ties by providing tax 
cred its, exemptions or deductions. 
Bul, as Th e Economis t recentl y 
poi nted out, why not encourage these 
activities with di rect subsidies? 

Our attempts at conducting eco-
nomic policy through manipUlations 
of the tax code is most responsible for 
our current tax mess. Presidential can-
didate Steve Forbes muses that the 
elimination of the myriiKI credits, de-
ductions and exemptions would put a 
lot of Washington lobbyists out of 
work, for it is no secret that the spe-

have ~uggesled repealing the entire 
tax code. The current proposal from 
conservatives, including Forbes and 
the Kemp Commission, is known as 
the nat la'. Under this plan, indi vidu-
als and famifies woufd enjoy a gener-
ous tax e~empt ion and pay one flat 
rate on any income earned heyond 
that exemption. Under Forbes' plan, 
a family of four would not pay taxes 
on its fi rst $36,000 of income. But on 
every dollar earned after that, Ihey 
would pay a flat rate of J 7 percent. 
Such taxalion is in sharp contmst to

Coming Up: 

. , 

Loo~lIlg up to the fro.l.e n tundm 
or the north, there seems to be a ray 
of hope. In Onlano, Canada, Premier 
Mike Hams IS seHlIlg an example for 
his ~outhern nelghhors by shOWi ng 
tha t real red uctions 111 t he ~ l /e and 
scope of government arc bencilclal. 

Ontario'S budget ror 1995 was 55 
bi llion, $9 ~ ill ion of which was ,1 111-
ply Interest on government debt. Har-
m ' admlnl ~lrat ion thought these fig-
ures wen.: unnecessari Iy high and un-
den(xlk ~()me reforms to tac kle the 
plOblelll. Proposed reductions 10 cur-
rent ~pend ing - real cut s - will 
amount 10 more than 17 percent . Wel-
fare, a program which needless ly 
keeps many unemployed, wi ll he cut 
hy 22 percent. 

Do I hear cncs or "cruelty" I'rom 
the peanut gallery'! As or 1995, a 
Toronto family earn ing only $50,000 
paid a marginal tax rJtcof50 percenl , 
in addition to a 15-percellt sa les tax. 
And still therc W[t~ nol enough money. 
Onlano's budgel deficil was $ 10 bil-
lion when Harris was elected; hc rode 
into office on the white horse of re-
duclIlg spend ing and laxation. His 
campaign promises of a 30-percenl 
tax cut and 20-percent overall spend-
ing reduction arc well on their way to 
becomlOg a reality, and Ontario wi ll 
be beller off because of it. 

Back here in Ihe good oJ' USA, 

Clinton in 1993, it meant that the top 
tax nlte must stand :11 an IOcredib le 
40 percent. And undercurrent law, the 
top fi fth of income eamcr~ pay over 
60 percent of all federal income taxes. 
Is Ihis fair'! 

Considcr the lo llowing example 
from the Kemp report about the cur-
rem system. Suppose there are two 
wheat farmers, Fanner A and Fanner 
B. Each has the same amount or land 
and costs as the other. Fanner A pro-
duces and sells 1000 bushels of wheat 
in 1995, while Farmer B - through 
careful land use and hard work - pro-
duces and sells 1200 bushels of wheat. 
Fanner A pays 17 percent of his prof-
its in taxes. But Fanner B pays 17 per-
cent on his fi rst 1000 bushels and then 
25 percent on the 200 extra bushels 
he made. Why should it be that the 
more Farmer B works, the more he is 
taxed? This is the way the current sys-
tem operates. Is tlris fair?

6 OPINION 

INTERVIEW: 
Continued from pate 4 

There arc some good features, al-
though these features need not be a 
part of the nat tax in general. First of 
all, It ends the double taxation of the 
return on capital. This is frequently 
stated as double taxation on sa vrngs. 

For example, you get taxed on 
your income once. and then you 
save it, and you get taxed on the in-
terest that it cams. So that in~ofar 
as you try to provide yourself with 
'oods in the future by saving. there 

IS douhle taxation on the good that 
you purchase in the future. because 
you've been taxed once when you 
put the money aside and once when 
that money earns interest for you. 
The Forbes plan would end the 
double taltation of the returns to 
capital. I think most economists 
would like thaI. 

Another thing that the Fomes plan 
docs is that it makes fringe benefits 
paid for by the employer taxable as 
well. Most health benefit programs to 
employers arcn 't taxed. although they 
are a form of compensation paid for 
by the employer. Well. the Forbes plan 
would make those things taxable. as 
they should be - they are compen· 
sation. 

WASTE: 
Continued from pa.e 5 
ence. 

Other' reforms should be consid· 
ered which would help reduce gov· 
ernment spending, none of which 
would be terribly popular among the 
chattering classes. One idea is to have 
some sort of means testing applied to 

In ...,.ral terms, how would a 
tIM tax affect economic 
arowth? 

If you lower marginal rates. 
workers will have more incentive to 
work or to rent their services to oth-
ers; and thus you ' lI see economic 
growth as a result of higher utillza· 
tion of re ources. labor and capital. 
When you remove the double taxa · 
lion on the returns 10 capital - as 
the Forbes plan docs - you'lI see 
more inveslmenl and therefore a 
faster Increase in producll vlly and 
morc growth 

According to Forbes. this add l' 
tional growth would caUl>e Incomes 
to go up by MJ mut.:h that tax revenue~ 
will not decrease but increase. and 
wipe out the deficit. I' m not so sure 
that 's a correct assumption. but you 
shouldn 't assume that the income base 
is going to rcmain the same under a 
nat tax as it would under the current 
progressive income· tax system. I 
think incomes would go up some. 
Whether they would go up enough to 
offset any revenue non·neutrality un· 
der the 17-pcrccnt nat rate or nOl. I 
don·tknow. 
In terms of balancing the 
budget, which do you think 
would do more - cutting 
federal expenditure, or using a 

social security and Medicare pay· 
ments. Social security was a bad idea 
to begin with. and paying out the 
money to those who do not need the 
assistance accentuates the problem. 

Generation Xers would have a 
more financially secure future if s0-
cial security cuts were made; they 
would then be able to invest their 
money in IRAs instead of turning it

flat tax to encourace ~? 
As far as I'm concerned. cutting 

expenditure to reduce the deficit is 
the way to go. The amount of waste 
in government spending is abso-
lutely incredible. The true tax on the 
economy is the amount that the gov-
ernment spend. the proportion of 
the GDP [Gro . Domestic Product) 
which the government goe out and 
purchases In one way or another 

Some people argue that we ought 
to cut taxes. which will force a reduc-
tion in spending Unlortunately. we 
found out during the Reagan year;, 
that [that] wa, wrong. The Reagan 
revolution took place only on the tax 
side and not on the expenditure side. 

What 's the way to cut the deficit 
- through a flat tax or through cut-
ting spending? I like both ideas. When 
expenditures are cut. the flat·tax rate 
could be lowered. 

If I could have $100 billion less 
in government spending. or $1 00 bil-
lion less collected in taxes through a 
nat lax system. which would be more 
beneficial to the economy? I guess I 
would say $100 billion less in gov· 
emment spending. but I don't have a 
model worked out which would give 
me an answer to that question. Just 
on my feehng that the true tax on the 
economy is government spending on 

over to the:. government to be wasted. 
If population and taxation rates re-
main con tanto social security under 
its present administration will go 
bankrupt soon after the beginning of 
the next century. If it i necessary to 
keep social security in existence. reo 
forms like this must be considered. 

Our estimable ladies and gentle· 
men in Congress must stop blindly

final goods and services. I would say 
reduction in government spending. 
But there's no reason why both can't 
be done. . 
Are there particular problems . 
with administering a flat talt? 

There are certain firms which are 
locked Into contracts - contract 
with unions. which will force them 
over the next twoor three years to pay 
for fringe henefits. Yet the Forbes plan 
would not allow them to deduct 
[fringe benefiL~) from their expenses. 
Thus thetr net income or profit wou Id 
be higher. and they'd get taxed more 
under the nallax; and therefore they'd 
fire some labor because labor be-
t.:omes much more expensive under a 
nat tax in that transition period.

ACOUSTICS: 
New technology 
could outpace sonar 
Continued from pac. 1 
UnderIyI,. PrInciples 

Dr. Michael J. Buckingham. an 
SIO professor of ocean 'acoustics 
and an ADONIS co-developer. carne 
upon the idea for acoustic daylight 
in 1985 whi Ie working on sonar for 
the English Ministry of Defense. 

"With sonar. there are basically 
two ways of going about [underwater 
detection]," Buckingham said. "One 
is you can transmit a 'ping' and just 
lislen for an echo - this is known as 
'aclive. ' The other way is to be listen· 
ing for something to be going past. 
such as a subma· 

the ocean, but yoU do have a natural 
sound field or ambient noise gener-
ated by breaking waves .and other 
processes." Buckingham explained. 
"So, ambient noise in the ocean is the 
equivalent 10 ambient light in the at· 
mosphere. Given that background, we 
assumed we had a fairchance of using 
the ambient noise in the ocean to take 
photographs. " 

"Light doesn't really propagate 
through the ocean," Buckingham 
adde<.i. "Basicall y, the ocean is opaque 
to light but transparent to sound." 
The Technology 

ADONIS scientists compare 
acoustic daylight' s fundamental prin· 
ciples to that of photography - a 
camera. without a flash. uses ambient 
light reflected off an object to create 

rine. radiating 
noise - and 
that's known as 
'passive.· .. 

Buckingham 
said that for a 
long time he 
"had a feeling" 
there was a 
more effective 
way of conduct-
ing underwater 
detection. 

"You don't have any 
light field In the 
ocean, but you do 
have a natural sound

In acoustic·

scientists use 
sound as thei r en·

The ambient 
noise in the ocean 
serves as an ana·

sphere. 

"It eventu-
ally dawned on 
me that maybe 
we could do the

"Lightdoesn't 
work in the sea, 
but sound does," 
Buckingham 
said. "So if you

der the surface, 
then you· ve got 10

Buckingham's intuition eventu-
ally brought him to SIO six years 
ago, with the hopes of one day cre-
ating a technology which would 
enable man to peer into the ocean's 
mysterious depths. 

Buckingham had 
pinpointed the principles upon which 
his acoustic·daylight imaging system 
would rely. he needed to construct an 
acoustic lens which was able to focus 
on slight variat.ions in lhe ocean's 
ambient·noise field.

The UCSD Guardian 

involved with the acoustic-daylight 
imaging theory. Buckingham and oth· 
ers created a "fairly standard" para· 
bolic dish measuring three meters in 
diameter, capable of detecting high-
frequency sounds. between eight ki· 
lohenz and 80 kilohenz, which move 
with relative ease through water. 

'The acoustic lens design is the 
same as if it were being designed for 
some other acoustic application." 
Buckingham said. '11's what we're 
doing with [thedishJ that is different." 

The dish itself. however. doesn't 
actually ret.:ord the sound; it simply 
reflects the collected acoustics back 
to a series of 126 hydrophones - or 
underwater microphones - mounted 
on the front of the dish. facing inward. 

In lum. the hydrophone convert 
the acoustic image into a et of elec· 
trical ignals. which. through a se· 
ries of manipulations. are rendered 
onto a Macintosh computer screen 
into real·time. false·color. pixelated 
images. which are refreshed 30 times 
per second. 

As is the case with any scientific 
breakthrough. however. it takes a 
certain amount of time before the 
results can be fully appreciated by 
the public at large. 

"The image itself is of rather 
poor quality," Buckingham con· 
ceded. "It's not the quality of a 
camera image. The reason for this 
is that the wavelength of light is 
very small. and across the human 
pupil there are something like 
20.000 wavelengths. 

"Ourwavelengthsarealotlarger. 
and we only have about 300 wave-
lengths across the dish. So. the aper-
ture of the dish is quite small com· 
pared to the eye. Measured in wave-
lengths. it's 300 wavelengths VS . 
20,000 [wavelengths)." 

In fact. according to the S10 sci-
entists. achieving a simi lar resolu· 
tion with sound would require a 
more-or· less unfeasible dish. mea· 
uringsome 600 meters in diameter. 

Nevertheless . 
Buckingham finds 
encouragement in 
the results of his 
team's teslingso far. 
and compares the 
current state of 
acoustic-daylight 
imaging to the de· 
velopmental years of 
television. 

"One day, [tele-
vision pioneers) got 
an image on a 
screen. and it 
wasn't a very good 
quality image, but 
that wasn't impor-
tant." Buckingham 
said. "The point 
was [that] there was 
an image."

In August 1994. 
using one of SIO's 
research platforms 
located off the coast 
of Point Lorna. 

Claire Schnelder/Guall1lan 
Soundln.1t out: Dr. Michael J. Buckingham 
has developed a way to ·see" underwater. 

project scientists 
dropped the 3.000-pound ADONIS 
into the ocean for the first time. Al-
though scientists first tested acoustic· 
daylight principles in the water off of 
Scripps Pier in mid·I99I. the new 
acoustic lens. ADONIS. wasn't con· 
structed until the following year. 

In the 1994 test, ADONIS scien· 
tists set up a target frame-contain· 
ing one·meter-by·one·meter square 
panels which could be set up in 
various tic· tac·toe· like arrange-
ments - on the ocean floor and 
tested ADONIS at various ranges 
from the target. 

Despite some initial setbacks 
concerning flooding of the unit's 
electrical circuitry, scientists were 
able to collect a good amount of raw 
data in which the shapes formed by 
the panels mounted in the target 
frame were visible on the computer 
sc reen. But more importantly. the 

images rendered on the screen con· 
firmed to Buckingham that which 
he had believed all along: that acous-
tic-daylightimaging was indeed fea· 
sible. 

During thatsarne initial test. scien· 
tists also erected the target frame at a 
distance of 40 meters from ADONIS. 
which. according to Buckingham. 
currently has a range of 80 meters and 
can resolve images which are one 
meter or larger in size. 

ADONIS scienti ts conducted 
anotherrest run of the system off the 
COast of Point Lorna in December 
1995. and although the results have 
not yet been released. Buckingham 
called them "encouraging." 
Buckingham eltpccts to release the 
newesl findings. contained on 70 
CD·ROMs. within the next several 
months.

haven't got an equitable society yet." 

Also at the meeting. university 
administratoo released a report en· 
titled '['he Schnols and UC; A Com-
mitmefll 10 the Future of California, 
which detailed the more than 800 
outreaCh and intervention programs 
the university runs for kindergarten 
through 12th·grade students. 

Representatives from three of the 
programs which were discussed in the 
repon presenled their programs to the 
regents. 

'There are people out there [who) 

want to help, and there are children 
out there r who] want to be helped." 
UC Riverside's University-Eastside 
Community Cooperative panicipant 
BreMaris Johnson said. "There are 
kids out there in more danger than I 
was, and [this program] just goes to 
show that somebody [ who] ended up 
like me can have a happy ending." 

Several regents were pleased with 
the progress which outreach programs 
have made in improving people's 
lives. 

'1'here are some chi Idren out there 
r who) we seem 10 feel we have to drag 
in kicking and screaming. but some of 
them want to be helped," Regent Roy 
Brophy said. 

Although Connerly wassilentdur-
ing the presentations. he said he raised 

his concerns during a pri-
vate conversation that 
morning with Wilson, UC 
President Richard 
Atkinson andChairofthe 
Board Clair Burgener. 

Several UC faculty 
members offered rebut-
tal s afte r hearing 
ConnerJy's comments. 

Mark Patte,son/ Guardian 
A new fece: Outgoing Student Regent Ed 
Gomez listens to Student Regent-
Designate Jess Bravin. 

"SP-I basically asks 
the university 10 attain 
high levels of diversity at 
the very ti me it depri ves 
lhe university of an indis-
pensable inslrumcntto the 
attainment of thai diver-
sily." UC Berkeley soci-
ology Professor Jerome 

The UCSD Guardian 

Karabel said. "You cannot, in a totally 
color-conscious society with a pr0-
found history of differential treatment 
based on race and ethnicity, suddenly 
invent color blindness in 1996 and 
expect to maintain a di verse student 
body." 

Earlier in the meeting. the regents 
approved Atkinson's revised time-
table for the implementation of SP-I 
with a voice vote. with only Student 
Regent Ed Gomez dissenting. 

"If [SP-I and SP-2] are imple-
mented any quicker than the way that 
[the task force] sees best fit for the 
university. those who would Vale for 
such a move would actually be voting 
to hurt the university." Gomez said. '1 
think we should vole against this on 
those grounds." 

Sean Walsh. Wilson' s press secre-
tary. said the governor attended the 
meeting to vote on Atkinson' s imple-
mentation timetable. although Wil-
son was absent during the vote itself. 
Walsh later said the governor was in 
the bathroom when the vote took place. 

Under the new timetable, SP-I 
first affects undergraduates applying 
for admission in spring 1998. How-
ever. the policy will still affect gradu-
ate and professional school students 
applying for fall 1997. 

UniversilY admini stralors cited 
logistical reasons for lhe delay from 
the policy's original effective date. 

"Because the Jan. I, 1997 date is 
out of sync with tradilional admis-
sions cycles and the ta k force pro-

conference during last Thursday's UC Board of Regents' meeting, 

posed expanded academic criteria for 
admission, the new policy could not 
be put in place rapidly enough for 
students applying to the university for 
fall 1997 to make informed decisions 
to best position themselves for seek-
ing UC admission." stated a UC Of-
fice of Ihe President press release. 

Later in the meeting, the regents 
approved a $695 increase in non-res i-
dent tuition, a $1.000 fee increase for 
medical, dental and veterinary stu-
dents and a $2,000 fee increase for 
law and business students. 

"We believe that lhe impact will 
be minimal . given that campuses have 
dedicated at least a third of the fee 
revenue to financial aid, and that the 
fees remain below the average fees 

charged at comparable institutions," 
UCOP Budget Director Larry 
Hirschman said. 

However, Student Regent-Desig-
nate Jess Bravin, whose appointment 
was approved by the board on Thurs-
day, was concerned lhatthe imposi-
tion of differential fees could be sel-
ting a dangerous precedent. 

"We should reverse this trend as 
soon as po. ible," he said. 'There 
really is no philosophical justification 
for singling oul these professional 
school students that doesn' t apply to 
every olher program of this univer-
sity. 

"I think il is a mistake to proceed 
down Mr. Hirschman's road," Bravin 
added.

ACOUSTICS: 
Technology has 
potential Naval uses 
ContInued from page 7 
ApplicatIons 

The ADONIS technology. once 
perfected, could serve a myriad of 
uses. Buckingham said. 

The U.S. avy. for example. 
could potent ially usc acouslic-day-
ligh t imaging 10 detect the presence 
of mi nes in the ocean - some of 
which can be triggered by sonar -
wilhoul causing them 10 explode. 

"[ Imaging wi lh ambient noise l 
is covert ; we don' t radiate anYlhing. 
So, un li ke aCli ve sonar, we arc not 
transmitling - no 'pings,' no echo 
oes. nothing like that," Bucki ngham 
said. "We are not injecting sound 
inlo the water at all. We just pul the 
lens out and reco rd an image." 

"[Bul] you Clln not only detect an 
objecl, you can classify it as well 
because you can recogni Le it; Ihal' s 
one of Ihe main advantages," 
Buckingham added.

" It is vision and sightl hat we lIre

PI ... a •• : Fans seek out Todd 
Martin in hopes of autographs 

DAVIS CUP: 
Chang, Martin roll 
Continued from pal. 18 

Michael Chang isn't doing too 
badly himself, ranked number-five in 
the world, while lim Courierand Todd 
Martin round out the list of tennis stars 
spearheading a renewed American 
domination of the world tennis scene, 

It was a bit of a surprise when 
Chang - a San Diego native who 
played for nearby San Dieguito High 
School - and the 14th-ranked Martin 

PACIFIC: Swim 
places well at PCSCC 
ContInued from page 14 
tenned "incredible" by her coach. as 
the co-captain swam to a I :55.25 time 
and took third place, despite compet-
ing unshaven to further prepare her-
self for NCAAs. Other impressive 
showings in the 200 free came from 
Parkinson (sixth, I :43 .43) and 
Jefferson (ninth, 1:43.54). 

Day two was rounded out by Andy 
Hollywood's ninth-place swim in the 
100 backstroke and by t he men's 800 
free relay team' s second-place show-
ing (6:55.34). 

The third day of competition 
opened with David Tudury returning 
to make his mark yet again, this time 
in the 1650 free . Tudury impressed 
hi s coach, this time with a second-
place finish and a time of 15:56.56. 
good enough to rank him fourth in the 
UCSD record books. He was followed 
closely by Beiter in fifth and McAteer 
in sixth. with times that put them at 
ninth and tenth, respectively. in the 
annals of UCSD swimming. 

Heather McPherson; who had been 
on the NCAA bubble for the Tritons, 
came up big, qualifying for nationals 
with a 53,98 time in the 100 free . 

Then carne UCSD' s specialty: the 
200 breaststroke. A plethora of Triton 
athletes stepped into the limelight for 
this I'dCe, led by freshman Kelly Byme 
onthe women's sideand by Bruneron 
the men's, 

Bymeeamed third placein2:24. 16, 
while Bruner's fourth-place time of 
2:06.95 once again cracked a school 
record. Melissa Kealey rallied from a 
2:30.82 finish in the race to post an 
NCAAquaJifying markof2:28 .83 in 
a time trial later that evening. while 
Tabke's 2:29.79 was good enough to 
earn her a ticket to Atlanta . 

The final perfonnancesofthe meet 
came from the 400 free relay teams. 
Both teams took fourth, the women 
paced by Parker's amazing 52.34 an-
chor leg and the men by Jefferson's 
46,93 in the lead-off slot. 

From there, it was the divers who 
placed the exclamation point on the 
weekend for UCSD. Sheri Takeuchi 
grabbed fourth place overall. ,,:ith 
teammate Kristi Young close behlOd 
in sixth. Adam Burgasser took to the 
air on the men's side and hit the pool 
on his last dive with a third-place 
finish locked up . 

were selected to represent the U.S. in 
a Davis Cup match against Mexico 
last weekend at the La Costa Spa and 
Resort in Car')bad. 

Many wondered whether this "sec-
ond-string" unit of Chang and Martin 
were the right team to represent 
America. After all. Agassi and 
Sampras would have been a more 
fonnidabletandem.1n the end. Chang 
and Manin spoke volumes about the 
vast improvements in U.S. tennis. The 
duo walloped Mexico, 5-0, 

So. what is the Davis Cup, and 
why has it become such an important 
measure of a country's tennis talent? 

The Davis Cup is similar to goJr s 
Ryder Cup. Both sports are individual 
games; but in one tournament each 
year. players from around the world 
compete - as a team - for their 
country, 

The Davis Cup is a year-round 
tournament which pits countries 
against one another in competition for 
the single symbol of national excel-
lence in tennis. In a sport which mea-
sures an athlete's individual skills. the 
Cup has become a hotly contested 
measure of a nation's tennis domi-
nance as a whole. 

.. ---I 

The UCSD Guardian 

So how can the U.S. afford to send 
its "second string" to defend Ameri-
can pride in the sport '! 

The answer is simple: We' re good. 
So good, in fact, that even the "third-
stringers" could probably whip any 
country's top players, Imagine Cou-
rier and Patrick McEnroe playing 
singles. and the Jensen brothers as a 
doubles team. 

Even this group would be more 
than a match for most of the countries 
seeking to knock the U.S , from its 
current pedestal atop the tennis world. 
Thus, why should the U.S. wastc its 
best players, Agassi and Sampras, 
when others can shine in their place'! 

Chang and Martin exemplified the 
current American dominance in ten-
nis by crushing their opponents from 
just south of the border. 

The only highlights for the beaten 
foes came from the stands. where 
Mexican pride ran high. and the only 
fireworks on day one were provided 
by a U.S. fan. In the second match of 
the day. with Martin pummeling 
young Alejandro Hernandez, some-
one from the crowd yelled out. "ba-
gel," a phrase which refers to beating 
an opponent withoutgivingupagame.

It was only on this occasion that 
the United States lost its cool. Martin 
appeared rattled. scolding the fan ve-
hemently. 

"Alex is giving it just as much 
effort as I am." Martin said after-
wards. "When you're in a loud coli -
seum and everyone is yelling. it' s not 
bad [to say that). But when it's com-
pletely silent and somebody yells 
somethingsrupid, it·sdisappointing." 

That, however. was the only mo-
mentatwhich the U.S. players wcre in 
less than full control. Following the 
match, America's evident domina-
tion left Martin more concemed with 
his club preference on the links than 
with his shot selection on the court. 

"If you guys would stop asking me 
questions." Martin said during a press 
briefing, ''I'll be out there [on the 
course) pretty soon." 

So, while Martin hit the links. the 
press headed to their computers to 
explain how the United Stalcs' latest 
Davis Cup success was further evi-
denceofitscurrentlevel of supremacy. 
Right now, the ones hanging "help 
wanted" signs are those countries 
forced to play against the resurgent 
U.S, squad.

Minami took care of all of the 
Tritons' setting needs, fini~hing 
with 35 assists , Middle blockers 
Dan Thomassen and Bill Sinclair

Tritons Take Second Twice 
OPENER: Men's and women's track start season at SDSU Invitational 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and women's 
track and field seasons began last Sat-
urday at San Diego State. with both 

teams gelling an early 
jump on the 1996 
schedule wilh so lid 
results. The two 
squads each fini shed 
second ovcrdll, high-
lighted by individual 
first-place finishers. 

The inaugural 
meet of the season included schools 
such as host San Diego State. 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Point 
Loma Nazarene. UCSD took horne 
first-place finishes in the women 's 
triple jump, hammer throw ,800 meters 
and the high jump. The men also 

crossed the finish line first several 
times, including in the 1,500 mClers. 
100 meters, 4 x 400 relay -and a 1-
2-3·4-5 finish in the ) ,000. 

"We did extremely well for the 
first ITlCCt of the year." Triton Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale said. "ll was 
a great competition, as you can tell 
from all the close scores. 'thought we 
had a real balanced effort." 

On lhe women's side, Lisa Shepard 
cxcelled in the triple jump, claiming the 
top spot with adiSlallCCof36' II ". Fresh-
man Heather Winbeny and Sabrina 
Wilson finished 1-2 in the high jump. 
while Maggie Dwire stole the show by 
edging out Aztec Sharifa Cox by two-
hundredths of a second, 2: 19.66 to 
2: 19.68, in a photo finish in the 800. 

"Maggie brought the crowd to a 
roar when she came from behind to 

win the 800 meter ," Van Arsdale 
said. 'That's the kind of performance 
that the team can be proud of." 

The men 's individual events 
~howcased someofUCSD's bright-
e ttrack stars. Juan Magdaurog won 
the 100 in a time of 11.19 and lin-
i hed second in the 200. Five Triton 
athletes stood alone althe top in the 
3000-meter race, with J.J. Castner 
ahead of the pack, followed by Goss 
Lindsey, Brian Leek, John Walsh 
and Rich Erkkila. 

The Triton 4 x 400 relay squad of 
Kevin Marsh, Kirk Miller, Tim Pru-
dence and Jose Arceniga also took 
first place with a time of 3:26.70. 

UCSD will host tough Division U 
opponents, Cal State Los Angeles, 
UC Riverside and Cal Poly Pomona, 
next week at Triton Stadium. 

ROLLING: 
Ladies tennis romps 
Continued from pale 20 . 

Somers and Huberman contin-
ued to play consistently, posting 
wins at number three and number 
five, respectively . Somers fought 
past her Claremont counterpart. 6-
4. in the first set and cruised to a 6-
3 victory in the ~econd . 

Meanwhile, Huberman's match 
tightened up in the sccond scI. She 
eventually took the tie-breaker and 
the win. 6-4, 7-6. 

Hoecker played the closest 
match, barely edging out her op-
ponent in the third sel. After win-
ning the first set, 6-3, she failed to 
convert on a few crucial points 
and lost the second set, 7-6. 
Hoecker, however, stayed'aggres-
sive and regained control in the 
third, winning the set, 6-4. 

"I'm happy with the way she 
played," LaPlante said. "She was 

Tuesday, February 20, 1996 

aggressive, earne in to the net and 
didn't tighten up when it got close." 

UCSD's only singles loses 
came in the second and fourth po-
sitions. Kurokawa struggled at 
numbenwo, losing 6-2,6-4. Mean-
while, Takemoto faced a tough 
competitor at number four. 

"She played a freshman who will 
definitely play higher on the ladder 
next time we play Claremont," 
LaPlante said. 

Takemoto countered her 
opponent's powerful ground strokes. 
taking every opportunity to come to 
the net. Unfortunately, her 
opponent's Oawless play earned the 
win, 6-3. 7-5. 

The Tritons' convincing victory 
over Claremont on Saturday pro-
vided a healthy boost to their confi-
dence and their Division [[I stand· 
ings. 

"As long as we stay healthy, 
we' re going to be up there again 
this year," LaPlante said. "[Our4-
I record) is a good start."

After winning its first two matches, 
the UCSD men's volleybaJl team en-
tered its final match of the Mizuno 

Invitational with the 
drcamor a tournament 
championship. 

Division [[I-rival 
La Verne turned that 
dream into a night-
mare, however, by 
sweeping the Tritons 
in three games Satur-

day night at RIMAC Arena. 
The sparks or brilliance the Tri-

tons had shown throughout the tour-
nament were nowhere to be found 
againsllheLeopards. UCSD uffered 
from a series of service errors in the 
first game, mental lapses which pre-
vented the Tritons from finding their 
groove. The team also had a terrible 
time putting away scoring opportuni-
ties, mustering a pathetic kill percent-
age of 0.094 for the game. La Verne,

the no-hitler by striking out the final 
Occidental batler, who ballied Bums 
intensely, fouling off a long series or 
pressure-packed pitches. 

"[That] was my fi rst college 
game," Bums said. '" had been out 
fora while with injuries. but 1 threw a 
lot in practice on Tuesday and felt 
good. Ijust wantedtocomeoutlThurs-
day night] and have fun ." 

Burns, who picked up seven 
strikeouts in her fi ve innings of work, 
got plenty or help from her young 
teammates. 

''I'm baek," the freshman right-
hander said, in reference to her nag-
ging injuries. "Back for the season." 

In the first game of Thursday's 
doubleheader, UCSD capitalized on 
some early Tiger mistakes and pound-
ing the Occi pitching, cruising to a 
comfortable six-run win. 

The Tritons also kept Occidental 
offbaJance with some excellent pitch-
ing from freshman Mary Jane Otto. 
0110 and the suffocating Triton de-
fense kept the Tigers at bay, whi Ie the 
Triton offense came up big, banging 
out seven hits in the third inning. 

UCSD countered two early un-
earned Tiger runs with a five-run 
binge to take control of the game 
entering the fourth inning. Freshman 
outfielder Kelsey Bennett cracked a 
single to tie the game before Mann 
gave the Tritons the lead for good 
with a blistering RBI double down 
the left-field line. 

Sarah Snyder, 4-5 with three runs 
scored, played the role of workhorse 
as well as offensive catalyst, catching 
both ends of the doubleheader. 

"I feel great," an elated Snyder 
said after the game. "l'm ready to 
play some more." 

"Sara Snyder is a coach' sdream," 
Gerckens said. "She works hard and 
never complains about a thing. She 
worKswiththepitchers,andherblock-
ing skills are incredible. She is 
definately a team player." 

"I' m very proud of our pi tchi ng 
staff." SnydersaidofherbatterymaleS. 
'7hey really stepped it up tonighl." 

"They are going out there with the 
idea that they're going to give it ev-
erythingthey'vegol," Gerckens said. 
"It doesn' t mailer how many outs 
there are. They just don't get down." 

capitalizing on the Triton's inconsis-
tencies,took the game, 15-4. 

Following a pep talk from Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik, the Tritons 
came out strong in game two, led by 
All-Tournament selection Tom Black 
and junior setter Satao Minami. But, 
as the game wore on, the Tritons had 
difficulty finishing offlong rallies and 
found the see-saw battle shifting in 
favor of the Leopards. 

Minami, coming off the bench, 
sparked a late-game rally with a team-
high 34 assists. Unfortunately, the 
late surge was not enough, as UCSD 
failed to take advantage of two game-
point opportunities and let the game 
slip away, 16-14. 

Game three proved to be another 
down-to-the-wire finish, as freshman 
Devon Jeffcoat and All-Tournament 
big man Guy Mount provided the 
strong blocking which had been miss-
ing from the Triton allack. Unfortu-
nately, the Leopards were not to be 
denied, winning 15-13 and clinching 

the match on a kill by tournament 
MVP Rob Sneider. 

"[La Verne] played great," 
Dannevik said. "We've just got to 
learn to [play consistently]." 

In its first action of the tourna-
ment, UCSD won a tough, five-game 
match against the club team from UC 
Berkeley. The Tritons clinched their 
first victory of the season with a well-
balanced allack which was able to 
exploit the Golden Bears' 34 service 
errors. 

Sophomore setter George You 
made sure that the team had plenty of 
good sets to hammer over the net by 
dishing out 67 assists. Black led all 
scorers with 34 kills, and Jeffcoal and 
Mount dominated the middle, hitting 
orf the quick sets from You. Jeffcoat 
and Mount finished with 13 and 20 
kills, respectively. 

"[Mount] and [Jeffcoat] are pretty 
unstoppable," Dannevik said. "We 
needed to drive the middle quite a bit

that shot the ball better than the _ 
University of Southem Cali-
fornia. NAIA-power South-
ern California College rolled 
over UCSD on Thursday 
night. 99-78. 

"I thought we played 
well," Triton Head Coach 
Greg Lanthier said. "We just 
didn't shoot very well." 

II was UCSD's shooting woes 
and a bizarre series of calls that led 
to a 14-0 Vanguard run fi ve minutes 
intothesecondhaJf.That run pushed 
SCC's lead from thl\,'C to 17 points, 
and it may have been the "crazy" 
calls that allowed the Vanguard to 
run away with the game. 

"I don' t know if the calls cost 
us," Lanthiersaid, "but they enahlcd 
them to score 14straight points,and 
that was the end of that." 

Freshman forward Mike Wall 
led the Tritons in scoring with 21 
pointson 90f 15 shooting, inc!uding 

The Tritons' woes began 
early in the first half, as they 
shot a dismal 33 percent be-
fore the intermission. The 
halftime deficit was 10 
points, as SCC took a 46-36 
lead to the locker room. 

The UCSD shooters 
picked up the pace after the 

break, although they still struggled 
from behind the three poi ntline. The 
Tritons, who rely on lhethree-pointer 
as a scoring option when the oppo-
sition keys on Aune in the paint, 
couldn't get many open looks be-
hind the arc and finished eightlor37 
from three-point land. 

"We had some open looks at the 
basket," Lanthier said. "We just 
didn't knock them down."

Nothing seems to be going right 
for the UCSD baseball team. Com-
ingoff a three-game losing streak on 

the road, the 
hardballers were 
looking forward to 
coming back to San 
Diego and playing on 
their home field. 

Unfortunately, 
UCSDdropped both 
games of a double-

header at borne to Division U Cal 
Stale Los Angeles on Saturday, 3-0 
and 2-0. The Tritons (2-6-1) have 
now lost five straight and are in dire 
need of ~ win. 

Senior left-hander Mike Bryant 
SIaI1ed the opener, going seven strong 
imings while giving up only two 
runs. In the seventh, however, he 
collided with a Golden Eagle while 
covering first base on an infield

grounder. Bryant stayed in to pi tch to 
the next bauer, but soon had to be 
taken out because of dizziness. 

". got kicked in the head when I 
went to cover the bag," Bryant said. 
"My sinuses got jarred, and so all this 
fluid was running out of my nose . • 
was trying to pitch, but • couldn't 
stop the running. I could've finished 
the game, but they took me out for 
my personal well-being." 

While Bryant and reliever John 
Titchen limited the Eagle offense to 
three runs, the Triton offense was 
only able to muster five hits. 

UCSD tried to rally with one out 
in the bottom of the eighth after 
Triton second-baseman Nick Wil-
son and designated-hitter Craig Birk 
walked on successive at-bats. Carl 
Abramson then reached on an error 
to load the bases. 

The Tritons' scoring opportunity 
disappeared, however, when Mark 
Mason's line drive to center field 

was caught, and Birk was doubled-
up at second. 

UCSD also squandered two hits 
and a walk in the ninth, surrendering 
the first game to Cal Slate L.A. , 3-0. 

The nightcap did not tum out any 
better, as UCSD was shut out, 2-0. 
Marc Abrams pitched well enough 
to win, giving up a mere two runs in 
seven innings of work, but the Tri-
tons were limited to just two hits. 

"It just seems like we can' t gel on 
the same page, offensively and pitch-
ing," Abrams said. "We were hop-
ing for this doubleheader to get us 
out of the funic. I know our hitting 
will come around. It' s just a matter 
of time before we get on the same 
page." 

"We came oot flat in all parts of 
the game," Triton Head Coach Rob-
ert Aetcher said. "Someone has got 
to step up somewhere along the line, 
whether it's a pitcher on the mound 
or someone hilling the ball."

Triton Men Take -Fourth, 
Women Fifth at pcsce 

• 

NCAA-BOUND: A strong showing at the Pacific 
Coast Championships left UCSD with 23 qualifiers 
ByD .. KnIft 
Sports Editor 

Last weekend 's Pacific Coast 
Swim Conference Championships 
(PCSCC) marked the biggest meet of 
the season for the Triton swim 
team. And, it made the most of 
the opportunity, having what 
Head Coac h Doug Boyd 
termed, "the be t [PeSCC) 
meet since I' ve been here at 
UCSD." 

The men's team fini shed ill 
fourth place - a result made 
more impressi ve by the facllhat it had 
a significantly smaller tearn than any 
other school in attendance - while 
the women took a very respectable 
fifth. With that meet in the books, 
UCSD now has 23 athletes( 13 women 
and 10 men) qualified for nationals. 

The championships pitied the Tri-
tons against a hoard of West Coast 
schools, including Division I and D 
squads priming for NCAA spots. 
UCSD, meanwhile. sought to qualify 
still more swimmers for the Division 
ill championships in Atlanta, Ga., 
next month. 

DavidTuduryhadthebiggestmeet 
of his UCSD career, placing highly in 
three races. On Thursday. he hit the 
pool in the 500-yard free and came 
away in fim with a time of 4:32.99. 

"Tudury was just awesome," Boyd 
said. "He dropped 20 seconds off of 
his 500 time." 

Tudury was not the only one to 
post a stellar time in the 500. Team-
mates Mark Beiter (4:39.40) and Tim 
McAteer (4:40.49) took ninth and 
II th, respecti vely, to round outa great 

Triton showing in the event. 
Other highlights from day 

one inc luded Grell KnOll 'S 
eighth-place finish in the 200 
individual medley (IM), fol -
lowed closely by Mike 
Jefferson in 12th. Kaley 
Parkinson turned in the first of 
a solid weekend of races by 

capturing fifth in the 50 free. 
"Knoll and Eric Bruner had great 

meets," Boyd said. "Parkinson had a 
couple of lifetime bests and so did 
Jefferson." 

Bruner began his strong toumey 
performance on day two when he 
grabbed fifth place in the 100 breast-
stroke, an event which boasted a host 
of Tritons on both the men 's and 
wornen's side. Shelly Tabke, Kelly 
Byrne and Sarah Chu (the laller duo 
swimming unshaven) finished sev-
enth, eighth and ninth, respectively, 
while KnOll accompanied Bruner 
across the line in seventh. 

Tudury and senior Carrie Parker 
were the stars of the day for UCSD. 
Tudury continued to shine by setting 
a school record in the 400 1M with a 
speedy time of 4:02.73. Meanwhile, 
Parker's swim in the 200 free was

Tritons Start Season, 2·2 
UP AND DOWN: After winning both games of a doubleheader at home, 
10-4 and 10-0, UCSD dropped two games to Cal Lu, 10-0 and 9-0 
By Mike Stange 
Staff Wnter 

Freshman Sarah Bums definitely 
made Ihe mot of her first colleglat..: 
softball game. The Triton pilcher 

threw a no-hiller In 
the second game of 
Thursday night 'S 
doubleheader agam~t 
Occidental, as UCSD 
crushed the Tigers, 
10-4 and I 0-0. 

The Tritons then 
faced a role reversal 

of sorts as they traveled to unfriendly 
Gibello Field at Cal Lutheran on Sat-
urday. The Regals trounced UCSD, 

10-0 and 9-0, as the Tntons once-
fl aming bat took the weekend off. 

HI knew [the contests versus Cal 
LuI were going to be tough," Triton 
Head Coach Patricia Gercken~ said. 
"We were coming off two games that 
were great confidence builders, but I 
don 't think were were prepared for 
Cal Lu Ju~t yet." 

Saturday' · contests with Cal Lu 
can be chalked up as a learning e>.pe-
rience for the young Trilon squad, 
which retu rns only one player from 
last year - senior thi rd baseman 
Christine Mann.

building." 

UCSO backed up Bums' gem on 
Thursday with plenlyofoffensivesup-
pon. Sophomores Mehs~aAgu i larand 
Heather Men7"clled the attack. Aguilar 
drove in the first Triton run on a deep 
sacri fi ce fly in the second inning and 
later smoked an RBI triple during an 
eight-run fourth inning which broke 
the game wide open, pushing the Tri-

to~ advantage to 10 runs. 
Menzel, who's already picked up 

the nickname "Bulls-Eye" from her 
teammates, collected four hits and 
scored four runs in the doubleheader. 

" I was having fun running Ihe 
bases," Menzel said. 

"We were swinging the bats really 
well with two out," Gcrckens said. 
"[Menzel] hit the ball well all night." 

UCSO'seight-run outburst put the 
pressure on the Tigers to score a run in 
the fifth to continue play. NCAA Di-
vision III regulations include a mercy 
rule which concedes victory to a team 
if it leads by at least 10 runs after fi ve 
complete innings of play. 

The game was indeed called early,

Continued from page 20 
the fi rst half, sending UCSD to the 
locker room wilh a slim, 28-25, 
advantage. The Tntons played tire-
lessly in the .ccond half, however, 
dommallng Chapman in all rc-
spects. Jeffries finished alop the 
UCSD scorers with 20 pOllll~ . 
Meanwhile, fcllow guard Cmdy

VictOry solidified its posllion atup 
the Chapman quad in the W'SI 
standing~ . 

"It was obvious that we wanted 
Ithe win] more," Jeffries said. 
'·We' re an awesome team, and we 
never gave up." 

Jeffries and her mates proved 
no less spectacular in thei r contest 
against Cal Lu on Saturday. UCSD 
was unaffected by the unfnendly 
confines of Cal Lu's gym, claim-
ing the overtime victory, 90-84. 

Cal Lu came out runn ing in the 
fi rst half, but the Trilons stepped 
up and capitalized on the quick 
pace of the game. Post players 
Anne Westmoreland and Sarah 
Schneider contributed at both ends 
of the court . Schneider snagged 
nine rebounds and sunk II points. 
Meanwhile, Westmoreland posted 
II points and eight boards. 

Outstanding all-around play put 
UCSD up, 44-41 , at the half. Cal 
Lu countered in the second half, 
however. UCSD trailed by two as 
the Regals went to the line with 
only 10 seconds remaining. Sink-

~ 

SPORTS 15 

ing her first free throw, the Cal Lu 
shooter put her team up by three. 
However, she was unable to con-
vert on her second attempt. 

UCSD grabbed the rebound 
and, b.::cause it had no remaining 
timeouts, quickly pushed the ball 
down the court . The pass went 
Inside to KarhJungwlrth, who sent 
It back out to Pam Conlini. Contini 
then found Jeffrie~ well behind Ihe 
three-point arch. With two ticks 
left on the clock, Jeff nes sunk the 
tying basket, sending it into ~T. 

"Jeffries steppeu up," Malone 
said. ··1 gue s she decided she 
wanted 10 go hack to the playoffs ." 

Jeffries linished with a season-
high 28 points, including four of 

~ix from three-p int range. She 
and Contini contributed live and 
nine assisls, respectively. 

Yamasaki also had a solid per-
fomlance, posting 17 point . Al-
though the Triton post-players 
were in foul trouble, forcing them 
to be cautious on dl:fense, UCSO 
dominated overti me play. 

"After it wentlo OT, I knew we 
were going to win," Malone said. 
"You could fee l the momentum 
shi ft . Marc ia's shot rea lly took the 
ai r out of Cal Lu' players." 

Outscoring theiropponents, 15-
9, in Lhe final minutes, the Tritons 
prevailed, 90-84. 

"We had faith we could win ," 
Jeffri e said. "We wanted it more." 

Now, UCSD's work is done. All 
the Tritons can do is wait and hope 
their season record and spectacular 
fin ish will buy them a pot in the 
playoffs. 

"You never can lell," Malone 
said. "These wins shouldkeepus the 
same or put us up in the rankings."

'!he domznance ofV,.s. men's 
tennis was showcased in last 
weekend's Val/is Cup action 

JIelp wanted." 
II was a phrase all too common Iy ut-

lered within U.S. men 's tennis circles back 
in 1990. No U.S. men ' s player had won a 
major loumament since John M cEnroe 
accomplishcd thai fea t in the late 19 Os. 
McEnroe. however, was on the downside 
of his career, and the United States' other 
recent star, Jimmy Connors, was spotted 
more often in lheannouncingbooth than on 
the court. American pride in lennis was 
fading. Europeans likeSlcfan Edberg. Boris 
Becker and Ivan Lendl wcre at the top of 
the world rankings, with no hope in sight 
for the hapless Americans. 

Whatadifferencea few years can make. 
Since 1990, the tennis world has wit· 

nessed an American invasion of the ·top 
rankings on the A TP Tour. Currently ,. five 
U.S. players arc ranked in the top 20, 
including two of the best the sport has to 
offer - Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras.

PORTS 
Triton Polo Sinks at Weekend Invite 
SIXTH: The Tritons got a taste of Division I in this weekends' Triton Polo Tournament, settling for sixth place in their division 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

After many years of succe~s, the 
UCSD women's water polo team is 
experiencing life in a sport about to 

go Divi ion I. In the 
pa~t, women's wa-
ter polo was not an 
NCAA-sanctioned 
port. Within the 

next two years, how-
ever, it will likely be-
come an official 
NCAA sport at the 

Division J level. 

Heidi Muzhik/Guardian 

Top schools across the country 
will then be able to offer their play-
ers scholarships. In fact, San Diego 
State and UCLA, who dominated 
this \Alcekend's action at the UCSD 
Triton Tournament, already have 
up to eight scholarship athletes on 
thei r rosters. 

The Tritons felt the initial effects 
of this impending change last sea-
son, when they fell from their cus-
tomary position atop the national 
women's water polo rankings. 

Making waves: UCSD opened its season with a rocky performance at the UC San Diego Triton Invitational last weekend. 

This year's season began with 
last weekend's tournament held from 
Friday through Sunday. The early 
season test brought together not on Iy 
some of the very best collegiate 
teams from the West Coast, but a 
talented group of club teams as well. 
The Tritons have traditionally made 
a strong showing at thi event-

UCSD placed second last year -
but this year's tourney was rough 
for Head Coach Denny Harper's 
bunch, as it was forced to settle for 
sixth place with a 1-2 record against 
college teams. 

The Tritons faced their opening-
round opponent, UC Davis, Friday 
afternoon at theCanyonview Aquat-
ics Center. The Aggies were up to 
the challenge of taking on the home 
team, however, as they put a damper 
on UCSD's first game with a 10-8 

Tennis lronncing 
FOUR·IN·A·ROW: Women's tennis rolls against 
Claremont, 6-3, extending its record to 4-1 
By Robin KezJrlan 
Staff Writer 

Extending its winning streak to 
four, the UCSD women's tennis team 
bested its opponents from Claremont 

College last Saturday 
by a score of 6-3. 
Claremont's program 
has improved greatly 
in recent years, fin-
ishing fifth in Divi-
sion m Nationals last 
season. 

"We'd never lost 
to Claremont, but we knew we would 
have a tough match this year," Triton 
Head Coach Liz LaPlante said. 

UCSD'stalentedlineup, however, 
did not falter against its Ie s-experi-
enced competitors. The Tritons took 
the point advantage early. winning 
two of the three doubles contests. 
Miki Kurokawa and Yumi Takemoto 

dominated theiropponcnts at the num-
ber-one position, 8-4. UCSD's third 
doubles team, comprised of Hilary 
Somers and Annie Hoecker, also 
carne out on top, winning its match, 
8-5. 

Michelle Malephanpakul and Su-
san Huberman suffered the only 
doubles loss for the Tritons, losing 8-
6. 

UCSD stayed true to fonn during 
the singles matches, winning four of 
the six match-ups. 

After a couple of frustrating early 
season losses at number one, 
Malephanpakul obliterated her 
Claremont competitor, 6-1, 6-2. 
"Michelle [finishedhertwo sets] well 
before everyone else," laPlante said. 
"She was able to dominate the game 
because her opponent wasn 'tas strong 
as the others she has played."

victory. 
UCSD bounced back in its after-

noon game by downing the Univer-
sity of Southern California, 7-4, 
evening its record at I- I and selling 
up a must-win situation against 
UCLA. 

The Bnlins came into Saturday'S 
conte t hot, after slaughtering arch-
rival USC, 17-3, in their first game on 
Friday. The Triton needed the win to 
maintain their hopes of a tit Ie shot, but 
fell hard by a core of 13-2. 

With that loss, the Tritons found 
themselves relegated to the fifth-
place game in the collegiate divi -
sion against Stanford University. 
UCSD could not salvage its week-
end with a win over the Cardinal, 
however, as the big red machine 
stormed to an 8-3 victory, dropping 
UCSD to sixth in the tournament. 

With this finish, the Triton went 
on to battle the sixth-place team 
from the club division, the Outsid-
erl> , on Sunday. UCSD was finally 

able to pick up its second triumph of 
the tournament in that contest by 
toppling the Outsiders, 7-3. 

"We were a little disappointed," 
Harper said. "I thought we would be 
a little more competitive." 

UCSD's struggles were mostly 
at the offensive end, as the Tntons 
tallied points all to rarely . 

"It 's only February though," 
Harper said. "I think we're in the 
hunt , and the championships aren't 
until May." 

Women's Hoops Tops Chapman, California 
Lutheran; May Clinch Final Playoff Spot 
CLUTCH: Marcia Jeffries nailed a three-pointer with two seconds left to 
send the Tritons' game with Cal Lutheran into OT, where UCSD prevailed 
By Robin Kezlrlan 
Staff Writer 

It came down to the final min-
utes of the last two regular-season 
games for the UCSD women 's 

hoops team. The 
Triton knew the fu -
ture of their season 
lay in the results of 
Friday's contest vs. 
Chapman and 
Saturday'S match 
versus Cal 
Lutheran. 

They would likely have had to 
turn in their jerseys and contem-
plate what could have been, if they 
had been defeated in either match-
up. A victorious finish, however, 
and a trip to the Division III 
regionals would have been well 
within their grasp. 

"It was a must-win situation for 
all three teams,"Triton Head Coach 
Judy Malone said. 

UCSD met the challenge, win-
ning both games to finish the sea-
son with an 18-6 record. Led by a 
stellar performance from senior 
Marcia Jeffries, the Tritons domi-
nated Chapman, 65-49, in the first 
of the two games on Friday. 

UCSD and the Panthers were 
evenly matched at the outset of the 
contes!. As the clock ticked down, 
however, the Tritons utilized their 
knowledge of Chapman's game to 
shutdown their opponents' offense. 

"We lost our defense in the 
middle of the season, but we had it 
back on Friday," Jeffries said. 

Chapman made low-percentage 
shots to keep things close during

points were a key vs. Cal Lu.
