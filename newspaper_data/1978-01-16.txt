Reg Fee interns keep 
track of 4.5 million 

by Reed Alpen 
Associate News Edlaor 
When the Reg Fee Com· 

mittee bandies its $4 .4 
million budget it needs in· 
depth, information on the 
units that will receive the 
money. For the past two 
years they have relied on the 
Reg Fee Intern program to 
gather this information. 

"I try to determine if the 
various programming 
boards and units around 
ca mpus use their time , 
money and resources effect-
ive ly," explained Karen 
Roberts, this year's pro-
gramming unit intern. "For 
the most part they seem to be 
meeting as many student 
needs in the area of pro-
gramming as possible." 

All together there are five 
inte rns, covering Office 
Academic Support & Infor-
mation Services (OASIS) , 
Student Health Service 
(SHS) , programming, the 
College Deans offices and 
Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services (CPS) . 

The interns each make an 
extensive survey of their 
units. They analyze toe 
unit's budget, see where the 
money goes and evaluate the 
effectiv~n'ess of the unit. 

During March each intern 
will file a report with the Reg 
Fee Committee. 

However, Anne Carberry, 
the program coordinator, 
stressed that the "interns 
aren't conducting an investi-
gation into their units , but 
rather acting as a liason 
between the unit and the Reg 
Fee Committee. They can 
form a link between the 
students and the administra-
tion that's lacking." 

Mary Anne Rogers, the 
Dean's offices intern, said 
she was interested in finding 
out how the various Dean's 
offices saw tbeir role on each 
campus. "It would be nice to 
see if the students have the 
same conception of the 
Dean's offices as the offices 
do, " she said. 

La Verne Washington, the 
CPS intern, is looking for 
changes in the unit that may 
have resulted from the unit's 
reception of a new director 
at the end of fall quarter last 
year. She is also interested in 
how CPS interacts with the 
other counseling programs

UC Regents and top officials 
must now disclose finances 

The California Fair Political 
Practice Commission ruled last 
week that UC Regents and top 
administrators must disclose 
their personal finances the 
same as do other public 
officials in the state. 

The commission's ruling 
directs the UC officials to 
disclose the size and nature of 
theit investmentS, real estate 
holdings and sources of income. 

The action, which was taken 
under provisions approved by 

the voters as Proposition 9 in 
1974, does not apply to UC 
faculty members. 

The commission 's ruling 
came despite a threat by the 
Board of Regents to sue the 
commission if personal 
financial disclosure was 
required . 

The regents have said they 
would rather disclose their 
holdings in cases when they 
were specifically affected by 
a board decision.

One of the major disappoint-

ments of the budget, according 
to both UC President David 
Saxon and the UC Student 
Lobby, was Brown's faJlure to 
include $6.5 million r~uested 
by the Regents to fund financial 
aid in the Educational Oppor-
tunity Program (EOP) and for 
a portion of the Student 
Affirmative Action (SAA) 
Program. 

Gove ... or Browa 
(Currently, the $100-quarter-

ly Education Fee funds all EOP 
financial aid and 45 percent of 
SAA costs. The state covers the 
rest of the SAA costs.) 

If Brown had included the 
$6.5 million for EOP and SAA in 
his budget, it would have 
enabled the Regents to reduce 
the Education Fee.

UCSD scientists to chart chemistry of the brain 
by Laura A. Richter 

News Edi&Or 
Understanding the chemistry 

of the mind and how it affects 
behavior and mental illness is a 
major unchart,ed area of 
science. UCSD scientists have 
recently received a grant of 
$850,000 from the National 
Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH) to explore the possibi-
lities this area presents. 

David Janowsky, M.D. , 
coordinator of the project, 
submitted a 400 page propsoal 
to the NIMH with fiopes that a 
research and 

cou ~~==:!l~.-

funding. Under competition 
from 23 of the top psychiatry 
departm~nts in the country, 
UCSD was rated second out of 
the eight that were chosen in 
the selection process. 

J anowsky explained that the 
grants had been designated to 
facilitate interdisciplinary 
research at mental health and 
clinical research centers. "The 
idea of the grant is to combine 
the efforts of scientists who 
treat patients, with those who 
have theories or who have only 
experimented with animals," 
said J anowsky. 

Instead of 

project, the grant has been 
directed to setting up a general 
system by which many projects 
may be undertaken, according 
to J anowsky. 

A team of approximately 18 
directors will explore how 
drugs and their side effects 
alter information processing, 
the memory, psychomotor 
tasks and behavior. 

Grants were re.warded to 
other applicants to study child 
therapy , schizophrenia , 
psychotherapy and the chem-
istry of mental illness. 

Subjects for the experiments 
are recruited from ads 

in newspapers or from the 
psychiatric ward at the 
Veteran ' s Administration 
Hospital , if the patient is 
considered to be competent to 
make decisions. In attracting 
the "normal" person, Janow-
sky says an ad will present 
possible benefits to be gained 
by tbe participant or may 
simply draw people who are 
interested in the experiencial 
value of the project. 

"We feel we can learn things 
from the normal that apply to 
all patients," said J anowsky, 
as certain effects, such as loss 
of memory, would be universal 
and easier to measure in a 
normal person. 

Janowsky defines "normal" 
as functioning in the world and 
having no history -of mental 
illness. "You don't have to be 
the perfect person to be normal, 
just as long as you're not 
hearing voices," he said. 

According to Janowsky, the 
subject would not expect a 
permanent alteration of the 
mind to occur from tire 
experiments. He explained that 
the dosages of chemicals would 
last for only a few hours, and an 
experiment might last for a few 
weeks. He said that the 
chemicals work through tbe 
system and are active for a 
limited period. 

Addressing the question of 
regulation, Janowsky stated "I 
spend half my life around the 
bureaucracy of research. It's 
hard to get anything accom-
plished." He feels that "there is 
very little chance of anything 
catastrophic happening. 

Approval for experiments is 
difficult to acquire, said 
Janowsky, and the regulations 
are strict. Projects must meet 
tbe standards and consent of 
the UCSD Human Experimen-
tation Committee, composed of 
professionals , legal and lay 
people. He said that it is their 
job to explore the safety , 
scientific worth, and ethical 
question oJ carrying on such an 
experiment. 

Janowsky said Uiat the 
chemicals that are used in 
experiments in the Psychiatry 
department are all "commonly 
used but we find a new use for 
them." They must all hav 
been tested beforehand and 
have met Federal Drug 
Administration approval. " We 
are constantly monitored," 
Janowsky stated, "and must 
justify what we are doing." 

Ofthe restriction , Janowsky 
said, "They're an annoyance, 
but they're good because there 
have been abuses." 

Among the resea rcher 
involved in the grant are Lewi 
Judd, M.D., chairman of the 
Psychiatry department, who 
investigate the effects of 
lithium on thinking and moods, 
an(l Arnold MandelJ, M.D. , who 
feels that the long term effects 
of v.uious rehabilItative 
chemical may be different 
than their short term benefits.

A last interview - Part Two 
Steve Biko on black resistance 
INT: Wile. you speak of aa 

. e,ali&aria. .ociety. do you 
mean a IIOclaUs& OM? 

BIKO: Yea, I think there is no 
nmnine away from the fact that 
in South Africa there is such an 
ill distribution of wealth tbat 
any fonn of politic~ freedom 
which does not touch on the 
distribution of wealth, will be 
meanin,leas. The whites have 
locked up within a small 
minority of themselves the 
,reater proportion of the 
country's wealth. 

If we have a mere cbanee of 
face of those in governing 
positions, what is likely to 
happen is that black people will 
continue to be poor, and you will 
get a few blacks filtering 
through into the so-called 
bourgeoise. Our society would 
be run almost as of yesterday. 
So that for meaningful change 
to occur, there needs to be an 
attempt at reorganizing the 
whole economic pattern and 
economic policies within this 
country. 

BPC believes in a judicious 
blending of private enterprise 
which is highly diminished, and 
state participation in industry 
and commerce, especially in 
industries like mining, gold , 
diamonds, asbestos, and so on 
- like forestry and, of course, 
complete ownership of land. 
Now, in that kind of judicious 
blending of the two systems, we 
hope to arrive at a more 
equitable distribution of 
wealth. 

INT : Clearly y·ou see a 
country in which black and 
white can live amicably on

conflict is unavoidable, given

that, working on the present

sufficient groups that can form 
coalitions with blacks. But, the 
more such groups come up -

Letters to the Editor 
A sales pitch for a dead AS? AIR POLLUTION 

RESEARCH Editor: Mark Stadler'S commentary (w hat can we expect from the AS) 
seemed to me another sales pitch 
for a product that no one wants. 

Although he correctly points out ' 
the contradictions of the AS as 
government in name, b"t not in 
power, he mistakenly concludes 

that the AS must be given the power 
in order to represent the students . 

To draw an analogy, imagine a 
group of people bickering between 
themselves and arguing with 
others: a scene of confusion. Shall 
we give them clubs and sticks so 
that they might explain their point 
more clearly? 

Slanted reporting of AS news 
Editor: . 

Your article in Friday's T.T. 
about the .. AS sandbox" was a8 111-
conceived ano uninformative as 
Sieve Gould's article was informa-
tive an d well-conceived . The 
chlori ne story covered all the 
relative facts ina fair minded way, 
and pictured Chuck Millenbah, one 
of the primary actors and the only 
one 10 venture an opinion. 

In the AS article, all but the 
barest facts are shoved aside 
to make room for unsupported 
alle gations and accounts of 
infighting among the AS Council. 

Despite your tacit editorializing 
(in a two phrase headline, your 
piclure represents the accused 
"sandboxers" rather than Bekken. 
the main source of the opinion) ,you 
fail to delineate any of the issues 
around which the personalities 
disagree. 

When you finally get down to 
reporting the events of the meeting, 
a budget approval. you leave out 
any mention of where the budgeted 
funds are being spent, by whom, 
and so on. 

I have followed AS articles in 
your paper all quarter, and if that 
was all the information I had, I 
would truly feel that infighting is all 
that occurs. for that is all you 
report. If the AS is to have any 
image on this campus, it should be 
supported not only by allegations 
and counter allegations (which are 
necessary but not complete in 
themselves) , but by detailed 
coverage of the issues presented to 
the council. and then the action or 
failure of action by the council. 

Let students have the facts and 
make their own decisions about the 
effectiveness of the government.

Getttng back to the issue: student

not over whether a beer hall on

Swimmers show winning spirit

call Mark fo r information at 459-6409 
.-..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~J The UCSD men's swim team saw a combination of both good 

and bad luck on their Friday the 
13th meet against the Univer-
sity of Nevada, Las Vegas. 
Although tbe Tritons lost their 
first meet of the season, 72·23, 
they broke four school records 
and dlspiayed the kind of spirit 
that should make them winners 
-in the Cuture. 

Of the four school records Alle n with a 3: 28.0 'in the 400 
broken , fr es hm a n Lance yard Free Relay . All team 
Halsted claimed two. Halsted members s wam we ll , and 
swam the 500 yard Freestyle in Coach Morgan is " very happy 
5: 03 .8 and the 1000 Freestyle in . with the in·season times." 
10:31.6. Other record breakers Of the Courteen membe r 
include Joe Hernandez with a t e a m , a ll but three a r e 
49.5 in the 100 yard Freestyle freshman, and as Morgan says, 
and the combina ti on oC "We' re a young team, and the 
Halsted, Hernandez, Cox and future looks excellent."

God throws Super Bowl 
Coach Bill Morgan, a recent 

· · . ~ open & novice divisions ~ 
graduate of San Djego State, is 
enthusiastic and optimistic 
about his firs t year at UCSD. He 
was especially impressed with 
Frida y 's la rge spect a tor 
turnout and hopes that the team 
will continue to receive such 
s upport. Cons idering th at 
UNLV is a division I school and 
UCSD 's toughest opponent , 
Morgan feels that the Tritons 
performed superbly. He even 
expects " Cour or five of the 
swimmers to go on to na · 
tionals. " 

Semi.tough said tha t GOd 's wrath was earn'~ by the NFL Cor 
staging Super Bowl XII in the Louisi.ana Superdome which has 
been described as a "monument to man's imagination" and Pete 
Rozelle's claim to divinity. 

" Just like with the Tower oC Babel, God placed his anger upon 
man," noted Semi-tough. " The game was stacked against both 
teams: 10 fumbles, 4 interceptions and 20 penalties plagued it." ~Sat. Jan. 21 Sam-5 pm ~ 

· . 

The Dallas Cowboys and the Denver Broncos did, however, 
realize the predicament they were in. Each team attempted to run 
its plays with 12 men on the field in Super Bowl XII. 

And litUe did the fans realize that the 30 silver pieces they 
handed over to enter the dome had a special significance. ~ Sign Up in A8creation Office : 

In an attempt to save themselves Denver utilized the "eye for an 
eye" play by copying Dallas' shotgun formation as well as 
enlisting Moses to play. For their efforts God rewarded them with 
a 27-10 loss on the day of St. Humpbrey's eulogy.

Making your hair healthy Is our way of making your hair 
beautiful. We combine professional direction, dedicated at-
tention and effective products to achieve remarkable results. 

During the past several years the simple "PH Story" has been told over 
and over . Besides preserving nature's Acid Mantle of 4.5-5:'5 ph, 
shampoo must contain NUCLEOPROTEINS DNA and RNA. These 
essential building blocks in the polypeptide chain repair damaged protein 
in the same ratio from which it is naturally depleted from the hair!! A full 
complement of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and coen-
zymes hydrolized to the correct size and weight penetrate the hair shaft 
and are utilized by the NUCLEOPROTEINS to reconstruct hair damage. 
Deficient moisture must be replaced yet excessive moisture must be 
repelled in maintaining proper protective balance.

FOCUS , a student-run 
telephone "help line" with the 
goal of "providing an empathe-
tic and resourceful listener 
when other campus helping 
services are closed," will 
resume its services tonight. 

Muir College junior Judy 
Kravetz one of the organiza-
tion's c~rdinators, said last 
Friday that FOCUS, which was 
in operation for two weeks late 
last quarter, will be open for 
business for !leven-nights-per-
week consultation. 

FOCUS is operated by 
student volunteers, who first 
undergo a one-quarter training 
program led by community and 

university professionals , 
Kravetz said. The volunteers 
will be answering calls at 452-
4455 from 8: 00 pm to midnight, 
Sundays through Thursdays, 
and 9: 00 pm to 1: 00 am, F.ridays 
and Saturdays. 

FOCUS has scheduled two . 
orientation meetings for 
students interested in joining 
the organization. Both meet-
ings are set for 7: 00 pm in the 
Revelle Formal Lounge; one is 
tonight, the other Wednesday 
night. 

FOCUS was funded by the AS 
Council at last week's budget 
meeting for almost $1300. At

that meeting, before. FOCUS' 
funding was approved, Com-
missioner of Communications 
Dave Eisen asked a series of 
questions about the organiza-
tion. 

" I was concerned that we 
were funding a service that just 
dupl.icated services already 
proVided by other organiza-
tions, " Eisen said. 
Brown ••• 

(Con'inued from fron' pale) 
support lower tuition at UC. We 
intend to raise this issue again 
and hope we can convince him 
to support us in the future," 
student lobby co-director Jon 
Haber said. 

One portion of Brown 's 
budget, which allocates state 
funding for UC affirmative 
acfion hiring programs , 
indicates a change from the 
Governor's past policy. 

The $604,700 for the affirma-
tive action hiring program 
would be available for those UC 
employees, especially women 
and minorities, who previously 
had no opportunity to gain 
administrative experience. 

According to finance depart-
ment spokesman Dick Cutting, 
Brown' s allocation for the 
hiring programs followed a 
change in UC ' s plans for 
administering the program. 

The Governor's past objec-
tIOn to state funding for the 
affirmative action program 
hinged on UC's plan to use the 
money for administrative 
costs, Cutting said. 

In addition 
In addition , Brown ' s pro-

posed budget provides: 
- $1.5 million for research, 

including $500,000 for funda-
mental space science research. 
This allocation is seen as part of 
the Governor's recent interest 
in space research and in an 
" era of possibilities from 
limits" .
