"In 1977 , the UC D Constitution was written m one night by a couple of 
people over a bottle of tequila," says Associated Students President Craig Lee , 
giving one of the reasons he believes the constitution needs a major revamping. 

!-ee ran for AS PreSIdent with one of his campaign goals being the 
restructuri ng of the ASUCSD Constitution to make II more efficienr and 
effective for the UCSD community. During the summer of 1983, Lee read the 
constitutions of all the other UC campuses to see what might be incorporated 
into a new constitution. Then, laS{ fall , Lee solicited 111 the Guardian for a 
Constitutional Review Committee. Mary Rose Alexander, Marc Boroditsky, 
L10da Clark, Elizabeth Woodworth, Paul Jensen, Linda Sabo and Mark 
Diamond responded to Lee's advertisement and became the Constitutional 
Review Committee . 

"T he thmg that makes us unique here at UCSD, and also becomes our major 
problem, is lhat we are structured according ro a separate college system within 
one university." Lee pomts out, "We want to provide for each college's needs 
and also unify the University, like proViding for representation by the grad\Jllte 
students on the AS Council." To do this, Lee wants to use Berkeley's pyramid 
structure as a role model for our own constitution. 

Lee explained that the pyramid of power would begin at the base, with 16 
senators, eight to be elected at large in a campus-wide election. Elections would 
be staggered, with four in the winter quarter and four in the spring, "In this way, 
the smaller turnover would allow more training of new senarors and a more 
diversified representation throughout the school year: said Lee. To provide 
representation that would balance with this "university" voice, eight senators 
would be selected from the four colleges. Three positiOns would be reserved for 
graduate students , bringing the number of senators to 21 . 

"One of the responsibilities of each senator would be to serve on an AS 
commission as a form of checks and balances to the commssioners," said Lee. 
'This would also create more involvement by the senators in the decision-
making process of the Council. Right now there are no such responsibilities that 
come with the position ." 

The next level above the senate would be a body of five commissioners: 
communications, public relations, finance, programming and internal affairs. 
The present AS pOSitions of commissioner of elections and student welfare 
would be deleted. Instead, the coordinaror of elections would be an appointed 
position which would be held only during the time 01 elections, The student 
welfare commissioner's position and responsibility would be turned over the 
JudiCIal branch of the AS. Each commissioner would be provided with twO 
senators on the committee. 

Arop the commissioners there would be three vice presidents as in the 
Berkeley system: executive or admintstrative vice president, academic affairs 
vice prtsidenund e~mal affairs vice president, all of which would work with 
the president of the AS and form the executvie branch of the AS. The academic 
affairs vice president would be the liaison between aD professional and 
academic student organizatiOns and all administrative units on campus.(e.g., 
OASIS), as well as between the Academic Senate and the AS. The executive vice 
president would chair the AS Council meetings and also appoint people to the 
committ.ees that are non-academIcally related (e.g., parking). The external 
affairs vice president would handle all issues that relate to matters outside the 
AS, 

In addition, a controller would be appointed to a paid position to work with 
the president and the executive branch. The controller would be on the 
financial commission, but would be an ex-olIicio, non-voting member. 

From the Constitutional Review Committee's research of the Davis system, a 
definition of the AS presidency is being considered. In such a system, the 
president cannot run unless the person has 60 quarter units; the president 
appoints representatives to all committees requiring student membership 
(subject to AS Council approval), the budget is composed by the controUerwith 
recommendations made by the president, who holds the power of vero Oller aU 
AS Council actions. 

Lee is seeking more student input before the actual writing of the constitution 
begins. Recently, Lee sent a letter to all student organizations stating. "The 
Constitutional Committee is in the process of evaluating the present 
constitution, We would be grateful for any input from you .... The plan is to put a 
new constitution to the referendum in the middle of spring quaner, 50 if you 
have any ideas on what you would like to see on It, it is urgent that we get 
together immediately." 

The adoption of a new constitution would require a two-thirds vote of at 1east 
20% of the UCSD student body. What is needed, before this decision is made, is 
a unanimous input of 100% of the student body to ensure that we do not ha~ a 
recurrence of the "tequila night constitution: 

person who chooses to interfere with 
the orderly operation of the campus ... 
will be subject to arrest and criminal 
charges," the statement conttnued. 
McElroy was apparently prompted by 
events last Wednesday when 100 people 
disrupted the disciplinary hearings for 
lell students charged in connection with 
the November 25 demonstration agamst 
the Ce ntral Intelltgence Agency and UC 
PreSident DaVld Saxon.

AFSCME: too apathetic 
to start a movement? 
By KRISTIN DONNAN 

The clerical workers of the UC system 
may have discovered the importance of 
voting in union elections. Anticipating 
that the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
(AFSCME) would not win in a 
systemwide election last June, many 
workers did n<x vote, according to 
Catherine Wigham , president of 
Employees Assessing Representation 
(EAR). They now find themselves 
unhappy with the job the union LS 
doing, Wigham told the Davis Daily 
Democrat, and they ~ish to discontinue 
the unIOn 's representation. 

EAR, centered in UC Davis, is the 
main mouthpiece for clerical workers 
who are "conlldent they can decertity 
theIr union ," the Demoaat reporred. EAR 
has recently spread to UC San 
Francisco and UC anta Barbara, and It 
is attempnng to aid the 20,000 clerical 
workers who are within the union's 
bargaining unit, the Democrat was told . 

representatives had contacted employee.s 
at UCSD, but that there is nor enough 
intereSt of any kind to start a movement 
yet. 

This apathy may be the root of the 
problem which allegedly caused the 
AFSCME victory, but it may also 
contribute to why the union is indeed 
weak, according to another clerical who 
also preferred to remain anonymous. 
saying that he did not want to 
"adversely affect his chances for getting 
a management positIOn ." ThIS worker 
feeb that "there IS power 111 numbers" 
and that if people would realize that "we 
are the union ," then each lI1dlvidual's 
particIpation could only enhance the 
effectiveness of the union . 

The un ion's representation is not 
satisfactory for many because "they 
[AFSCMEJ haven't gotten us anythll1g 
the state hasn 't already offered," 
Wigham told the Democrat. Also. the 
union will not provide information on 
its bargainll1g unit procedures to clerical 
workers (who are, by law, mcluded in 
its unit) who have nor Joined AFSCME 
and paid dues, the Democrat was told . 

Loca1ly, these feehngs were also 
expressed by clerical workers. The most 
obvious example of the union's inability 
to "out-do" the Upiversity is in the 
recent pay raise bargain . One 
anonymous worker said that after the 
initial approach to the University for a 
pay increase of eight percent , the 
bargaining ended with the clerical 
workers receiving the same six percent 
as non-unionized workers. 

A pro-AFSCME worker at UCSD urged 
other clerical workers not to "respond 
emOtIonally with feelings that the unton 
is ineffectual or incompetent," and that 
workers cannot expect the union "to do 
something without popular support." 

Also locally, a clerical worker said that 
he could nO! understand why, If the 
union needs membershIp, it is nOl 
actively campaigning. He said, "I have 
not received one invitation, heard of 
one meeting or seen one nyer" 
announcing union informatlon sessions. 
He also mentioned that non-pa)'lng unit 
members arc not eligible to receive the 
newslem:r whIch contaIns mformatlon 
regardi ng that group whIch represents 
them. He contends that the union must 
"sell itself to me, and then I WIll decide 
if I want to give my money to suppOrt 
it " 

Jed Lehman, AF CME representative 
in an Diego, saId that theirs is a 
"limited staff of two people" who "try to 
gCt around as much as pOSSIble , but It is 
hard for us to comact the 5,000 
indIVIduals AFSCME represents here ." 
He saId there arc meetings the thIrd 
Wednesday of every month , to which 
non-members are welcome to come , 
though they cannot vote. Ill' also said 
that each local office has space at the 

nearest UC campus, where free 
information is available, as it would 
"serve no purpose to hide information." 
Lehman stated that the union "is not 
willing," however, to place non-paying 
members on the regular mallmg list, 
because that "does get expensive." 

A major complaint, made by a clerical 
worker who is critical of AFSCME, is 
that the representatives are hired by the 
bargaining unit but are not clerical 
workers themselves. "I support unions, 
but not one run by a group of 
individuals who cannot understand the 
interests of the group they represent." 

Lehman responded [0 this comment 
by admitting that the actual individuals 
who bargain with the state are not 
clerical workers, but that the above 
worker.is operating under an "erroneous 
perception," He stated that both the 
policy board and the negotiating 
committee (the group which dictates 
what the proposals will be) are 
composed completely of Untverslty 
employees - clencal workers. He urged 
dissentIng clencal workers to try for 
these positions so that they would 
rcalize the influence of these 
individuals. 

In support of the umon, an AF CME 
advocate said that the University does 
nor -ha ve our best Interests at heart," 
and thJt the prcsence of AF CME 
"keeps them Ithe Untverslty l honest" 10 
re!}\rd (0 safety regulations, etc. Lehman 
'Igreed , saying that "the Untverslty 
knows it has a problem; I[ has done 
studies WhlLh ~how that UC employees 
are paid 13- 15% lower than orher 
workers ." 

pkLL\t! rum h) pugr 12 

Though the union \vas voted in 
through an open election among aU 
mne of the UC campuses, only 58% of 
the clerical workers voted, the Democrat 
said . The union won the election with a 
slim 53% in favor, and Wlgham has 
stated that only 10-20% of the 
bargammg unit actually joined the 
union. It is this smaU following which 
raises doubts in the minds of EAR 
members as to whether AFSCME should 
be able to bargain with the state on 
behalf of all clerical workers, according 
to the Democrat.

Commentary 

UCSD· dancers may soon 
get the credit they deselVe 
By NATALIA TORRES 

UCSD's Physical Education 
Department is expecting the 
birth of a new minor this week. 
Margaret Marshall, the Dance 
Department Head , has conceived 
a dance minor proposal, after 
two years of preparation, that is 
being reviewed by the 
Committee on Educational 
Policies and Courses (CEP). 

Hoping that it will go into 
effect next fall , Marshall views 
the prospective program as a 
legitimate PE minor and 
necessary to complete a well-
rounded education within the 
Dance Department itself and 
UCSD as a whole. 

The wave of popularity that 
carries the general interest in 
both phYSical fitness and dance 
was a definite inspirational force 
for Marshall in creating the new 
minor. DeSiring eVLdence 
reflecting how dance students 
feel about such a program, 
Marshail conducted a survey 
about the degree of interest "in 
completing a dance minor at 
UCSD." 

She found "the general 
response was very positive." 
However, about 224 individuals 
OUt of the 800 surveyed 
expressed their inability to adopt 
such a minor - only because 
[hey were either graduating 
seniors or were already beset 
with two minors. 

Marshall has seen the 
enrollment in the dance program 

quadruple since its beginnings in 
1975. She has also noticed the 
numbers of Interested students 
include a lessening ratio of 
women to men, both of whom 
sought the benefits of dance nO{ 
only for professional reasons or 
simply for the aerobic exercise, 
but for enjoyment aad a sense of 
appreciation for dance as an 
artform. 

"Dance IS an artform," Marshall 
contends. She is hoping to shape 
the dance minor into a program 
that encompasses other artistic 
forms that lend new dimensions 
of creativity to the dance mode. 
This is backed academically by 
teaching the theoetical and 
historical elements embedded 
withm the infrastructure of 
dance. In Marshall 's eyes, this 
new dance program deserves a 
greater amount of anention and 
suPPOrt. 

"The program has been built 
up so much by student and 
teacher involvement that the 
Dance Depanment deserves to 
have a minor," Marshall says. She 
believes that the time and effort 
invested by students and faculty 
into in-class activity and out-of-
class preparation is easily 
equivalent to that of other fields 
of study. Marshail thinks the 
half-unit credits are unfair and 
cliscouraging to students 
seriously interested in pursuing 
the study of dance. 

The only alternative PE minor, 
Health Management and 

Exercise. specilkally emphaSizes 
the scien[1flC approach rather 
than the artistic. It requires a 
strict set of prerequisite science 
courses and offers no natural 
channels for development as the 
dance program has. In response . 
to these drawbacks, Marshall has 
structured the dance minor to 
avoid these problems, and as an 
encouragement to students 
interested in studying dance. 
Recognizing the need for the 
addition of Lhe theoretical and 
historical aspects of dance, 
Marshall has also structured the 
dance program in such a way so 
as to make it a valid course of 
study. 

With an emphaSiS placed on 
its educational role, the dance 
minor is constructed as a 
combination of lower division 
studio courses (in-class activity) 
with lower and upper division 
lecture classes. The studio 
courses are designed to put 
theory to practice, refining and 
developing that which is taught 
during lectures. The choices "f 
actual dancing include modem, 
jazz, ballet and musical theater, 
allotted a half-unit or twO units 
apiece, depending upon the 
level. 

The lecture courses, on the 
other hand, stress dance theory 
and history. Worth four units 
each are theater production 
(drama), music literacy, dance 
hislOry & philosophy, 

choreography and visual arts 
classes. By incorporating these 
theoretical lecture courses, 
Marshall sees the new minor as a 
well-rounded, broad-ranged 
program of high educational 
quality. 

Despite the ambitions, 
aspirations and efforts she has 
put into the dance minor, 
Marshall is faced with obstacles 
and frustrations. "The support 
just isn't there: she explains. 
The financial focus in the PE 
Department is first and foremost 
upon team sports such as 
women's volleyball and men's 
basketbaD. Despite its quadrupled 
enrollment and increased student 
interest, the Dance Department's 
budget and status remain 
basicaily the same. Finally, the 
absence of an autonomous 
Dance Department chair makes 
direct repre~ntation almost 
impossible, and hinders 
expedience in all matters 
because of the bureaucratic red

Regardless, Marshall looks 
towards the future of this 
currently non-existent minor. She 
hopes that the accomplishment 
of the dance minor will continue 
to attract a wide range of 
stuuents, not just those that are 
professionaUy-oriented, but also 
those interested in maintaining 
their physical fitness as well as 

. develping a sense of 
appreciation for dance as an art.

In previous quarters, the 

Physical Education Depanment 
has offered twO sections of 
Hatha Yoga. Due 10 lack of room, 
the InstructOr, Pamela Hall, hJS 
had to rum away approxllnaLely 
40 people per quarter who 
Wished to take one of the 
secllons 

Ac~ordtng to Dr. Howilrd Hunt 
of the depanment, there ha!> 

been pressure placed on both 
himself and the department to 
"deemphasize" classes such as 
Hatha Yoga, i.e., ·" personal 
development" classes. This 
attitude is very visible upon 
examination of the winter and 
spring schedule of classes. 
Considering aerobics, yoga, 
weight training and conditioning 
as the "personal development" 
classes offered by the University, 
the cuts made by the department 
are extremely concentrated in 
this area. Fourteen classes were 
cut by th e department between 
the winter and spring schedules, 
while seven were added for the 
spri ng quarter. Of the l4 cut, 
nine of the set:tions were from 
the "personal development" 
classes! Of the seven classes 
added to the schedule for spring 
'84 , IWlle were "personal 
development" classes! 

While lack of funding may be 
cited as an adequate reason for 
general across-the-board 
cutbat:ks in the department, the 
classes cancelled seem to have 
been anything but general and 
across-the-board. Perhaps a 
better indication uf wh ich classes 
muld be selected for cancellation 
would be a student dcniand In 
the ease of the Hatha Yoga 
clas>c~ , student demand would, 
In our cye", IndleJ te a need lor 
In .lddltlUnal "eCIILlH of the da"s 

rather than a cancellation of a 
section. 

Perhaps the greatest tragedy of 
t~e entire situation, however, is 
the fact that the schedule sheet 
informing Ms. Hall of the 
cancellation of the intermediate 
section of Hatha Yoga was dated 
March 2, 1984 but did nO{ reach 
her until almost a week Ialer. The 
lack of communication on the 
pan of the Physical Education 
Department administration 
effectively delayed any chance 
for student protest. 

Because of the lack of previous 
notificiltion 10 the instructor 
regarding the cancellation of one 
of her sections, it was logically 
assumed that the ommission 
from the schedule of classes was 
merely an oversight. 
Furthermon. , Ms. Hall f1rst heard 
of the cancellation from her 
students, nOl from the Physical 
EduLmion Department! 

Pctitions all' circulating, and 
response is prof4~ It ~ems 
obvious that student suppOrt is 
behind the reinstatement of at 
icuSl one section of Hatha Yoga. 
We hope tke PhYSical Education 
Department is U51ening to those 
it's designed to serve - Ihe 
studcnts.

A puzzling headline 
By PHIL LAUDER 

The normal , healthy mind needs a 
challenge. About rwo years ago, 
Amencuns whipped rhis need into a 
frenzy and started in on a puzzle 
rampage never seen before - and 
hopefuily never to be seen again. 

It all started with some goon named 
Rubik who put 27 mini-cubes togerher 
to make a bigger cube, then painted 
each side a different color and raked in 
major dollars. Rubik's Cube was the 
sensation of the nation. The goal was 
simple enough: just get aU squares of the 
same color on one of [he six sides, and 
do it on ail six sides. At first glance that 
didn 't seem too tough. 

So Americans rushed out 10 the 
supermarkets and swap meets that make 
up the nation 's commercial network, 
and bought their cubes. They brought 
the monsters home and attempted to 
solve them, never SlOpping to consider 
the 1011 soon to be paid by their nervous 
systems nor the stress and strain on the 
family unit. 

First mom, who bought the thing in 
the first place, tried it. Moms tend to 
have a low threshold for pain , so the 
average mother gave it up after ten 
minutes; she's gOt enough to worry 
about. From there it passed on to the 
kids. Kids are essentially clueless beasts 
who most often don't realize what they 
are plunging into. They got their hands 
on the cube, and soon the puzzle 
phenomenon was a WLld fire out of 
control. 

And then dad gOt his hands on the 
thing - and that was it. Dads don't 
take failure lightly - even when it's in 
their own beSt Interest - so after an 
hour of twO of futile maneuvers on this 
cubLc creature, something had to be 
done. 

So Out came [he solution booklets: "A 
Simple Solution 10 the Rubik's Cube," 
"Solving the Cube," "Cube Power Made 
Easy," "Thirty Days to a Flatter Cube," 
"I'm OK, You're OK, the Cube Sucks" 
and I don't know what else . People 
bought the cubes, they bought the 
booklets, they learned the solution, they 
impressed their friends with the 
solution, and then they got bored with 
the whole thing and threw the stupid 
block of plastiC into the attic. 

This tinal action was, of course, the 
demise of the cubes, the snakes, the 
pyramids, the octagons, the Missin 
Glinks and the rest of the plastic-borne 
puzzle generation. They departed the 
American scene as quickly as· they had 
arrived . 

But people sull love a challenge. Left 
in the wake of the departure of the 
Rubik's-genre puzzles, crosswords and 
Jigsaw puzzles remain as popular today 
as ever. I personally have never gOtten 
into crosswords, but I have been 
captivated by jigsaw puzzles - or 
maybe obsessed is a better word . One 
will be lying around the house and I'll 
sit down and say:OK, I'll fool around 
with this for, oh , 15-20 minutes." Then 
I'll get started and look at my watch and 
three hours have gone by. "OK, fine, just 
five more minutes - I have to get that 
tree finished ." Soon the sun is rising on 
a new day and I've gOt 650 of the 1200 
full, interlocking pieces fully interlocked. 
If m)' neck and back aren't the victims 
of rigor mortis, I'll continue. 

Word puzzles are also time-honored 
classics - the perfect gi ft for the man 
or woman who has nothing. I'm sure 
you know the ones: "Blue cannibals eat 
only red meat, red cannibals eat only 
white meat. White cannibals will eat 
anything without a tattoo, but blue 
cannibals always wear tattoos. Orange 
cannibals eat only on Tuesdays," and 
the question goes on for months. At the 
end it reads, "Now you're thrown onto 
Cannibal Island. What are your chances 
of survival?" 

None. Next lime , avoid the question. 
At times I do get into these mind 

games. I'm nO{ sure why, but I do. 
Yesterday a friend presented me with 
one such puzzler, an enjoyable little 
mental chaUenge. Tt-re eatch was that 
while attempting to solve thiS thing, I 
had to try to verbahze my thinking 
process, and the whole thing was being 
recorded. This was all for a psych 
expenment which was supposed to 
determine either my subconscious 
psychosexual desires or exactly how 
stupid the average human really is -
something like that. The results are 
being analyzed. 

For tho~ of you who have reJd this 
far into this column hoping only to find 
a puzzle somewhere, here was the 
question I was given: "Mrs. A has a two-
cup contai ner full of milk, plus twO 
empty containers, one .y.-cup and one 
Ilf.-c up. She wants to give Mrs. Bone 
cup of milk. How does she do it?" 

Some of you will work this thing out. 
Some of you will try and fail. Most of 
you just don 't give a damn. For this last 
group of you, here was my solution: Mrs. 
A ditches the empty containers and gets 
a measuring cup out of the kitchen. 

Happy puzzling.

Looking at life 
Nicaragua 

• In 

By ELLEN ARTHUR 
Deedec Halleck , a visiting lecturer in the 

Commwlications Department, has recently 
produced a video-tape called Waiti ng for 
the Invasion: U Citizens in Nicaragua, 
which shows the Nicaraguan society 
through Ihe eyes oj the US comnlLlnlty 
residing and working In NICaragua . HaUeck, 
who began her film-making career in New 
York over 20 years ago, talked with a 
reporter about her experiences in 
Nicaragua. 

"I went down there 10 make a fllm 
about Nicaragua because I didn 't beheve 
the films that I have seen showed the 
truth ," Halleck said . "Most of the films 
that are shown In the US are about the 
war zone, and not the actual life of the 
people." 

The 27-minule video includes 
interviews with American bUSInessmen, 
a US ambassador and citizens of 
Nicaragua. "I use very little narration in 
my videos," Halleck said. "I let people 
tell their own experiences." HaUeck says 
she prefers this because an authontauve 
narrator can easily bias a film. "This 
approach to a documentary is different 
because there is no authority figure 
narrating, so the person watching has to 
sort the facts out for themselves and 
draw their own conclusions." 

Of the four-year old Contra 
government, Halleck said, "It is a 
government for the people . It is a model 
country for the US as well as other 
developing countries." 

The US citizens who were 
interviewed m the film were enthusiastic 
about their experiences. An American 
biologist, working to develop ways to 
produce corn, was given a state farm on 
which to do her research. Her 
expenmen[1ng Involves ways to ontrol 
the mosqUitoes and other parasites that 
kill the com crops without the use of 
pesticides. Pesticides are not wanted by 

icaraguan people because they are 
dangerous to the environment and to 
the heakh of the people. "I can see the 
results of my experiments qUickly here," 
said the biologist. 

"People who live in Nicaragua have a 
positive feeling about what they are 
doing," said Haileck. "The govemment is 
behind them. Nobody is starvi ng down 
there. They aU have the right 10 an 
education, and the literacy rate has 
increased from 30% to 90% SInce the 
Contras took controL" 

According to HaUeck, the government 
officials (the comandantes) live very 
humbly In the community. "They live in 
smail houses and dress the same as the 

people." She says they are also 
concemed With the needs of the people. 
"If the community wants a day care 
center... they build it." 

"When the Sandinistas were In 
power, the market was a mud hole," 
said Haileck. "Now it has a cultural 
center and a school. It 's all cement, and 
there are murals on the walls." She 
added that the people are bUilding 
parks, hospitals, farms and schools. 
"The problem is that the US government 
is coming in and bombing what these 
people are building. They no sooner get 
something build and our bombes will 
come in and destroy II ," Haileck said. 

The film also shows the people 
digging trenches to protect themselves 
from bomb attacks. "Everyone builds a 
trench," said one man in the video. 
"The trenches are really for the children 
because it's the children thaI die in 
invasions, and it's the children that we 
need to [protect/ for the future of our 
Cpuntry." 

Halleck also has theories about the 
reasons behind US mtervention . "The 
govemment down [here is not a 
totalitarian state, al1d that's why Regan 
is bombing them" Even so, she says the 
spirits of the Nicaraguans are high. 
"Everywhere I went, people were proud 
of what they have accomplished," 
Halleck said. 

Before going to Nicaragua, Halleck 
spoke with executives of the MacNeil-
Lehrer show about her project, and they 
expressed interest in it. "I purposely 
went out of my way to show both sides 
of the controversy: she said, "and when 
I showed the 111m to them, they said 
that they weren't interested because the 
U ambassador 'Iooks like a jerk.'" 

The producers told Halleck that the 
US's side of the story was not credible , 
and they refused to show the video. "I 
believe that he [the US ambassador/ 
looks like a Jerk' because he has to lie ," 
Halleck said . According to Halleck, 
Robert White, formerly US Ambassador 
to EI Salvador, is now one of the most 
outspoken critics on the US 
government's policy on Latin America. 

Halleck is getting ready to leave San 
Diego at the end of the quarter. She will 
be going ba k to New York to begin a 
new project. Halleck is planning to start 

, an archival documentary of the Latin-
American conflict between 1890 and 
1940.

THE INTERNATIONAL CUP 

This is the feature game of Soccer 
Sunday. As t hey say, you save \'our best 
for last, and this certainly should be the 
best game of the day. Both teams, Pars 
and Octopricky , are undefeated t hb year. 
Buth teams look to be unbeatable. But one 
tea m has to lose and one team has to win. 
You can bet t he team that wins will be 
deserving. This Will be a return trip tothe 
AAA final s for Pars after losing in theC up 
fi nal last year. It has been an obsession 
ever since that loss to come back and win 
It all. Two-a-day practices, tryout" and 
cuts show how serious these guy ' are. 
These gu y, are gettingsogood they might 
give the intercollegiate leam a run for 
their money. In fact that's basically who 
they're playing in Octopricky. James' 
gang is made up nlostly of intercollegiate 
and former inter(:ollegiate players. You 
have Noerbert Kuhnert genera lly 
considered as one of the best players on 
the intercollegtate team three years ago 
and Bob Bullis ronsldered the same on 
last year 's team. Pars is not without their 
s tars though. Mehrdad Banki ISas good as 
they rome. ~uickness and an awfully 
strong leg are his auributes. Keeping it in 
the family, cousin Kavos h Uehpaneh also 
pi ays a big role. 

Budman's Predktion: Whew! This 
is a tough one to pick. If Pars passes well 
and keeps its cool I like Pars. If 
OcLOpricky's goalie can hold his own I like 
o ·\opricky. Call thi~ game a tu;,s·up. 

THE AMERICA CUP 
Thi, game is billed as a Haltle of Two 

Characters. Let's call one rheMouth,the 
other The Actor. 

T HE MOUTH . '1 he Mouth fi ttingly 
happens to also be thecaptain of hiS team. 
HIS name IS Mike Fahlbu,ch and hiS team 
I, the Giant Nuokle Attack. 

Now this IS a very good tcam, mind )'ou, 
which doe»n't need much of a bUildup. In 
·fact most coaches in most sp"rt~ usually 
give you the sad tale thatt hey are lucky to 
even have won a game much less to have 
made it tothechamplon,hip flOal.J:lut not 
Mike. Heck, he makes Mohammed Ali 
look like Truman Capote. He's about a, 
conftdent as they !:ome. .. l'here IS no 
doubt in my milld we will win it ," and 
" We're going to kick their butts" are twu 
of his les" confident s tatements. Gos h, I 
wonder why we're even going to play this 
game. 

T he other character is The Actor. This 
Academy Award wmning player's name 
i" eil Kus"ick and he play~ for the Hall 
Buster ', l:Iureau. Nell has drawn more 
penalties than any player III 1M hislury. 
It 's qUi te an art tudraw penalties. but Neil 
i" the master. Von 't be caught next tu Neil 
in the penalt y box or It wi ll be trouble. If 
yuu barely brush him he wi ll fall , tumble, 
coll apse. Oh my goudnesl>, he must be 
hurl. Call the medic". Of cour"c that wa, 

a penalty. How rould anyone be so hurt. 
Funny though, two minutes later he's 
running the full length of the field 
unrontested, fakes out the goalie and 
scores. What an actor! 

Budman's Predi.::ljon: Sorr y 
Mohammed, I haile to go wit h The Actor. 
Ball Buster's Bureau 3 goals to 1. 

THE CHULA VISTA CUP 
This game is a rematch s ince they both 

played in the same league du~ing the 
regular season. The result s of their game 
make;, the fin al even more interesting. 
The game ended in a I-I lie. 

After seemg bolh teams play, the 
favorite has to be The Friends of fat 
Chuck. These guys are human missiles 
with no regard for their bodies. I don't 
know if it 's the foreign substance 
introdu(.'ed to their bodies before each 
game or that these guys are just plain 
masochistic. I guess it'sall the times they 
have helped Fat Chuck out of some sticky 
s ituallons up at Argo. It's not that easy 
trying tu get a candy bar away from 
Chuck on a diet. 

The Super Studs are ac tually very 
small, thin, peekish lookingfellas who use 
this name to attract women to their game. 

one of them have actually had a date yet 
at UCS U, and they ' re all seniors. I guess 
they hope the power of positive thinking 
will wurk. They should havc named

a 6-1 margin every game. That's 
equivalent to a 42-7 football game every 
game out. This team is Impressive. 

The only team with a chance against 
them is the f ·69's. In fact the ~'-69's 
defeated Malcom b X in league play . The f · 
69's are led by Ihe Brazilian wonder foot, 
Paulo Porto. Paulo can do it all. Pass, 
shoot, defend, sell tickets. There's 
nothing Paulo can't do. The only thing, 
though, is that one man cannot do it all 
himself. 

Kosher Salomi IS the last team in the 
playoffs. They have an 'outside chance. 
Way outside. They do have talent un the 
goal with frank 'The I{ock' Montforte. 
!lut coupled with the loss of Luis Guasch 
and t he lack of a forward they cou Id be in 
big trouble. They do have one big plus. 
They have one of t he finest coaches in all 
of lM 's, John Conlisk. He's a great 
organ izer and motivator. Only one 
problem, he can't spell. Salumi? 

Hudman's Pr~di.:tion: F-69's win 
was a fluke over Malcomb X. Malromb X 
5, f -W's I . Malromb X will lose to Los 
Chingones in the Coed Championship. 

THE JOHN MUIR CUP 
The John Muir Cup, otherwise known 

as the Toe Kicker Cup, always presents 
interesting soccer. It ' ~ hard to figure what 
sport they're playing. They kick the ball 
into the goal hke you would in making a 
field goal, the old straight on way. They 
cross body 1)lock, hold and clip. Sounds a 
lot like American football. Maybe we 
ooght to use the old pigskin instead. 

Three teams are still left to fight it out 
for the championship, or s hould I say two 
pretenders and the soon to be champs. 

We have al ready sent the Muir Cup out 
to put the leam name Your In High Men 
on the truphy. These guys and gal s areso 
good we tried to put them right in the 
Men' s AAA Final. The men refused, 
giving some phony excuse". So now they 
have to go through the formalit y ul 
wmnlng Coed A. They havealilhe tools of 
a ~hampiun. {,)ui~k WOml'fl, a good goalie 
and J .I{ . 'Su per~tar' I{ichards to lie it all 
together into an unbeatable Ilackage. 

The t.;aLOr I{aiders have a possible 
chance of givmg them a game. They are 
undefeated but have plaYL'<l weak 
coml>t:tition.

And as we approach the eve of the

closer to our hearts right here on cam pus. 

Cmon, let's face it. The NCAA can't 
hold a candle 10 the UCSV 1M Basketball 
Championships if you really want to 
compare. The NCAA has 53 teams in their 
circus, the 1M Tou mey has lJeen doing 10 I 
teams for years. The NCAA takes rhe 
whole month to finish their tournament; 

The N(AA sells ucket!>; to theirs at 
outraaews price!i ($:10 to sit m the 
nosebleed scction at t he Seattle 
Kinadome, and you sull need binos to ~ 
anything). At the Tritun Pavilion, you get 
guaranleed courhide seats, Kreat 
L'Ompetitive basketball, and much more, 
for the absolutely ridit:ulous price of zero 
dollars and zero cents, 

Need we say more? And if you're 
inclined to view this year's exciting wind-
down to conclusion, it's slill not 100 late. 
Semi· finals In most divisions are 
contested tonight in the Triton PaVilion

Essence, the Iate-oomer to Women's B-ball, has plenty of 
talent and romes closest to being a sure thing as any team in 
the play-offs. These gals can run. play defense. and have all 
of the fundamentals down. Their only Achilles heel is t he 
lack of a dominating player, which many of the other

Easily as competitive as any division in 1M Basketball, 
Men's AA should be a bamburner this time around. Nearly 
all eight ullhe survivors (as of TueSday afternoon) can put 
lhe ball in lhe hole, so that leaves us with defense as perhaps 
the one key indicator. Party An imals and Life After High 
School fillihe bill in this area as well as anyone. From an

with flair and emotion and who've been there before. If you 
want to go with the team with the best player, try In 'N Out

fa ·tors supporting the ·proposal. First , there IS the 
sheer number of students involved in the dan e 
program. More than 800 students enroll in dance 
classes each quarreL Secondly, Jones feels that the 
quality of students merits recogm tion by the 
Univers it)' Advanced level classes in b,lllet and jazz, 
offered since last year, attest 10 the fact that there are 
serious dance students here who deserve credit for 
their efforts. Finally, the energy that the dancers pour 
imo their classes, many taktng twO or three a week, 
should be applicable towards an academi c goal. 

"The dance students need a good program to give 
them more for what they're givi ng us," says Jones. 

The history of dance at UC D begins with Margaret 
Marshall, coordinator of the dance program. She first 
stated dancing at 18, while earning her AA degree in 
business. After working as an executive for an oil 
company, Marshall realized she "was hooked on 
dance." She then went to UC Irvine, studying ballet 
under Eugene Loring, and received her MFA in dance, 
with an emphasis on teaching and research. Dancing 
professionally for Walt Disney Productions acquainted 
her wu h the technical and other performance aspects 
of dance, which she brought to UCSD when she was 
hired by the Physical Education Department in 1975. 

Marshall taught all six of the classes that were 
offered for the 213 interested students. The annual 
dance concert involved only 20 students, and was held 
in the north balcony of the gym with Marshall literally 
running the whole show. 

Although Marshall remains the only full-time 
employee worktng with the dance program, the faculty 
now includes nine instructors, representing the dance 
idioms of ballet, jazz, modern , tap and musical theatn. 

Jacqueline Hepner, with 34 years of experience. 
includ ing danctng for the ew York City Ballet, 
teac hes ballet along with Marshall. Pal Rincon, who 
teaches jazz dance, received her BA in dance and 
masters in choreograph)' from the U IU chool of 
Performing Ans. Joyce 'ich umaker, With a BA in 
mUSical theater and experience in local productions, 
IfI.5truCts musical theater, tap Jnd pzz classes. 

The number of students enrolled in dan e classes 
has more than quadrupled , and the annual cancert 
now sells out Mandeville Auditorium. These figures 
even underestimate the actual level of interest, for they 
exclude those who are turned away from the already 
overcrowded classes. inety percent of the classes 
must hold lotteries to determtne who can add the 
course , and at times there are as many as 300 people 
vying for 28 Spots. 

This tremendous growth spurred the dance minor 
proposal, ini tiated twO years ago. The proposal is 
unique in that it draws courses from the Drama, Visual 
Ans and Music Departments to supplement the 
dancing offered through the Physical Education 

Margaret MarshaU . dance program coordinator: "We 
teach not only m(}llement. but history, tcmtinology and 
professionalism ... 

Department. Academic requirements cover everything 
from movement theory 10 dance 10 the Western 
culture , from dance as a communicative tool to stage 
management and music Iitera"y. 

Jones describes the neceSSity of academic training in 
conjunction with the physical training to clarify the 
aims of a dance minor: "University-trained dancers 
should have a solid academic preparation in the 
theories and principles that are the foundation of 
dance. They should have an understanding of the ways 
that an can enrich human and cultural development , 
and they should be educated to see the necessary and 
vital interaction between all the ans. Their training 
should extend beyond technical dance skills and 
physical vinuosity .. . and represent a composite of 
skills, approaches and knowledge: 

Even without a formal academic program, dance 
students get more out of their classes than a good 
workout. MarshaU explains, "Dance is both cerebral 
and physical. We teach not only phYSical movement 
but history, terminology and professionalism. We try to 
get the students to go see dance productions and to be 
aware of how dance relates to sociery." 

Rincon, whose name is synonymous wi th Jazz at 
UCSD, has been with the progra m for eight years. 
"Dance is an an form and always has been ," she says. 
"Dance Involves the body. the soul and the Intellect. A 
dancer is given material by the choreographer and has 
to interpret it , reproduce it as asked , characteri ze It, 
and finally , perform it. The only diffe rence between 
dance and palntmg IS that you are the finished 
producL" 

Dance has enjoyed a recent surge of popularity in 
American SOCiety, and the growth of UCSD's program 
is, in part , a reflec tion of that trend. The media has 
both projected the art of dance, and capitalized on it. 
In recent years such Hlms as The Turning Point. All That 
Jazz and . of course , Flashdancc have featured and 
glamorized the world of dance . Dancers' strength and 
physical energy appeals to a public which is almost 
obsessed with fitness. Marshall says, "Dan<;e is now 
being recognized by people who are concerned with 
their health . Instead of jogging or playing basketball , 
they want to dance."

UCSD to bid fond adieu to the NAIA 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

A kh<x.wh not m:osnizable to the ptbIic, • coach's job Is not juS( what his tnrII does on the Door. 
There's recNiting. orpnizin& a 
compeddft schedule for the following 
season, IS wi as involvilll himself in 

~ philosophy of the school. One major 
chartae that wiD a&ect men's baskccbal 
and also men's buebel (the only two 
NAJA IeIIIlS here) is Ihc rumor thaI 
thos£ IIeamI wiD be leavin& the NAIA 
permanently in favor or die NCAA. 
Inslrad or bcJonaing to both fJftming 
bodies, UCSD wit be a member of the 
NCAA exclusMiy. This proposed move 
is supposedly [or practical reasons: the 
lime -element alone of having to deal 
with twO athletic associations is vel)' 
demanding on the Intercollegiate 
Athletic depanmenl and has caused 
many burdens in the past for tearns 
involved. 

Curiously. baskelbaB head coach Tom 
Marshal confinns lhat this rumor may 
become reality next season. "There's a 
YCI)' fJOd chance that 1ft will be an 
NCAA Oivision UI school next ~ar and 

lherefore, an independent," said 
MarshaD Tuesday in his office siluated 
on the second level of Trilon Pavilion. 
"So juS( looking down lhe road, I would 
ha...e to say lhat as 1ftU as planning to 
make it into the playoffs and doing as 
1ftD as we can this year, I am also 
seeing that there are many changes that 
need to be made thaI will affect the 
progtatn next ~ar." 

If this venlure does unfold, it has 10 
be viewed as a positiYC move for the 
school. Many sports will benefil, 
including swimming, which has been 
inconvenienced by lhe NAJA dual 
membership regulations on countless 
occasions. 

It appears thaI the switch to the 
NCM has become a reality. ALlhe 
Disttict III end-of-the-season coaches' 
meeting, MarshaD revealed the school's 
decision to abandon the NAJA 
Apparendy, lhe firsl two hours of the 
meeting (which are usuaUy spent 
seeding teams for first round playoff 
games) were spent discussing the 
ramifications of UCSO's move to the 

NCAA. Some coaches were upset that 
the district would be unbalanced next 
year (with UCSO gone, nine teams will 
remain in the conference - five in the 
nonh and four in the SOUlh), while 
others were contemplating how lhe 
scheduling process would be altered. 

Two possibilities were discussed. The 
. first was that UCSD would be eliminated 

from aU the DiSlrict III teams' 
schedules and play in a nine team 
conference. while the second was to 
continue to play UCSD although the 
contests would nOl be counted in the 
team's league records. The latter was 
finaDy agreed upon with a slight 
modification. Instead of playing the 
nonh reams once and the soulh teams 
twice (since UCSO has always been in 
the southem division), the Tritons will 
face all nine clubs once, with four 
visiting the Pavilion next year. It is a 

one-~ar agreement that WIU be 
evaluated at the end of next season. 

The NCAA playoff structure is 
drastlcaUy different than the NAlA's , in 
which most league teams (eight out of 

" 
" ::: 
'" 
-< 

ten in the District 111) make post-season 
tournaments. As in the more preSligious 
Division I. the NCAA Division 1II format 
is designed with each qualifying club 
being placed in a specific playoff region 
(wesl, east , midwest, mideast). Since 
UCSD will become an independent, the 
lone criterion for whether or not the 
team makes the playoffs will be its win-
loss record. Thus, the Tritons' 
scheduling priorities wiD change 
Significantly next year, as MarshaU has 
deleted aU Division I schools from the 
team's schedule and replaced them with 
lowly Division UI and NAJA clubs. 

"00 you know who I am playing next 
year?" asked MarshaU, with a touch of 
cynicism. "Cal Tech twice, Life Bible, 
Cal State Stanislaus and Cal State San 
Bernardino." The UCSD coach was 
obviously making reference to the 
relatively easy hneup that the Tritons 
will face 111 1984-85 as compared with 
the stemeSl schedule of any NAlA 
District III school this past season. But 
in the NCAA, selection process politics 
become a prominent reality, something 
that a low-scale intercollegiare program 
such as UCSD's usuaUy tries to avoid. 
"Sure il is a factor [for' quaUfying for the 
playoffsl, a ream's win-loss record, but 
that is lhe wa)l the NCAA is designed: 
says Athletic Director Judy SweeL ~Bt.it as 
far as the ream not deserving to go to a 
tournament because of an easy schedule, 
I think you can lind that to be the case 
almost anywhere, The leams that 
deserve to make the playoffs usually 
make it. The system is as fair as any 
pla)'OlT system: 

Sweet played an integral role in the 
deCision to not renew UCSO's 
membership with the NAJA, stating at 
the time that "the amount of work and 
effon It takes to be involved in (WO 
associalions is just too much to endure. 
We can case a lot of the pressure 01T 
this olfice [intercollegiale athletics!. as 
well as make it easier for the teams 
involved. It is in the best interest of the 
program: 

{J. ~ "? § ;; iii 
.' ~ L-__________ ~ __ ~~ ____ ~------__ ~~----------------------~ 

OriginaUy, UCSO became involved 
with the NAJA because there was no 
such thing as an NCAA Division III 
when the school opened operations 
bad<. in 1968. Bul when the NCAA 
expanded in 1974, UCSD took lhe 
opponunity to join the larger governing 
body, thereby involving the school in a 
duai-membership. Ten years later, the 
athlctlc department has reconsidered 
that decision (of belonging to two 
associations) and will noweoncemrate 
towards making its teams more 
competitive in the NCAA .

Dancing 
, (111 /111 UI'C/ JIlIlI1 pt'J:" 8 

"Evcryone IS SO Inll.> b{'ing healthy 
and exercising," agrees Jill Berlin, a Murr 
sophomore . "T .lking dance class IS the 
lun way [0 stay in shape." 

The athletK quality of d.mce, as 
shown by the media, has Influenced , in 
partIcular, the public's perception of 
male dancers. "The public is nO[ 
associating guys with the feminine 
image - dancers are now associated 
with strength , capability and virility," 
says James Cunis, who has been 
Involved in the dance program since 
1980. James Rex, a jazz teacher for the 
Recreation Depanment, estimates that 
ten percent of those enrolled in 
beginning dance classes are men. A 
former varsity baseball player, Rex hung 
up his cleats for jazz shoes two-and-a-
half years ago after his first dance class 
left hIm "so sore I couldn't walk. I 
thought, This must be something righ!.'" 
Rex says that "a 101 of people used to 
assume that all male dancers were gay. It 
IS now much more accepted far men to 
dance." 

The advemsing business has not let 
thIS widespread Interest in dance go 
unnoticed. ·Society is into the video 
era," says MarshaD, "and the fast 
movement of dance complements thIS 
- It sells a produc!." From MTV to Dr. 
Pepper commercials, sharp, dynamIC 
movement IS deSigned to entice the 
potential customer. 

Marshall in conVinced that the 
popularity of dance is more than a 
passing trend . "It is based on one, 
Increased publtc awarenes!> through film 
and TV coverage, and two, the health 
benefits. The combination of these two 
factors IS why the intereSl won't go 
awa}'." 

UC D dance Sludents are rarely 
aspIring professionals, but their 
commitment is no less sincere Curtis 
dances "to fulfill my own aspirations for 
personal improvement There is the 
physical conditioning side of dance, 
and also the individual aspect - the 
self-diSCIpline Involved In gauging 
yourself [0 set standards." Dance is "a 
form of self-expression and 
communicallon" .for jazz dancer Robin 
Roth. Barbara Greenglll, who has taken 
Jazz and modem dance classes, says, 
"Dance has always been a natural thing 
for me, and I wanted to learn the 
technique behind It . Dance is a hobby 
for me, a hobby I'll never let go." 

The dance program can be taken 
advantage of by those intereSled in the 
an at any level. ~lt offers one of the best 
opportunities for students to 
experiment. You don't have to be 
serious about dance. The faculty 
provides professional Instruction for 
beginning through advanced levels," 
notes Michelle Wasmuth, a baUet and 
jazz dancer. 

The therapeutic qualities of dance 
class proVIde a release from academic 
pressure. "Dance is a way to relieve 
frustration and anxiety," says Roth. 
Marcia Smith , who has taken jazz and 
tap classes, agrees that "dance helps me 
maintain my sanity." Dance class 
demands IuD concentrallon. It IS almost 
impossible to think about school or 
personal problems when holding a 
position or trying to learn a 

AFCSME 
II1ll/l/1ucd }1I)111 page J 

An antl-AFSCME worker said , "Maybe 
WIth pay, safety and benefit faclOrs , the 
union can do more lor us, but the 
University hasn't treated us badly: This 
person s'lId that he would upport EAR 
If an~ when It came to thIS campu~ 

Don Barnes, union pubhc rel.wons 
dlreLtor, told the [klllO< lui that he dId 
not believe thilt EAR would help wl>rker" 
In reJewng Abl.ME -Antl-uniontsm I!> 
somerhtng we deal with aU the time," he 
s.lId Barnes states that what IS presently 
on the bargaining table "repre ents the 
view!> 01 the workers," as ml'mbers 01 
the bargaining untt have been surveyed, 
the DC/lJ()(,wl reported. 

Wlgham's argument IS that unIon 

combllliltion. 
Another attractive leature of dance 

class IS the relaxed SOCial environment. 
"It's a great way to meet people," says 
Mona Hyre, a sell-described "weekend 
dancer." "The friendly aspect is so 
different than other classes, where you 
go Into a big lecture haD and talk to no 
one." Not only do faces become familiar, 
but a kind of "team spiri( develops 
within the group. Dancers applaud 
when sections of the class perform in 
front of the whole, and are qUick to 
compliment one another on a weD-
executed move. "I have friends that I 
never would have known if we didn't 
have a dance class together," says Roth. 

The excellence of the faculty here is 
almost always cited as one of the dance 
program's greatest Slrengths. Rincon, as 
portrayed In the opening scenano, 
exemplifies the kind of profeSSionalism 
common to UCSD instructors. CUnlS 
describes her a!> "a taskmaSler - she 
demands hard work. Pat is capable, 
accomplished and extremely 
knowledgeable." This tone of respe~t is 
echoed by Wasmuth. who adds that "Pat 
cares about the students and how they 
feel about dancmg." -She has the very 
special talent a teacher should possess 
- the ability to communicate with 
beginning and advanced dancers 
without confusmg them ," observes Rex. 
"Many Instructors can relate weD to only 
one level , and (his ability to work with 
all types of dancers makes her a true 
teacher." 

Rincon IS ~he director and founder of 
-Jazz Unhmlted ," one of a handful of 
dance companies performing.J3zz dance 
In concen. ~Jazz has reaUy come of age. 
It is now being recognized as an 
independent art fonn, and as a 
promoter of Jazz as an on stage. I feel 
very much a pan of that. 

~What is innovative about the 
company IS thal we can present 
anything. There IS no final point, or set 
number of steps to be learned in jazz -
it has so many different textures and 
possibilities .. 

Its link with contemporary trends, 
and the newness of the an form Itself, IS 
what makes Jazz dance so exciting for 
UCSD students. This IS the only UC 
dance program that includes jazz, as 
well as baUet and modem, in the 
curriculum, the other campuses generaUy 
favoring die latter. UCSD is known for 
its innovation - the Music Depanment, 
scientific research, even the architecture 
rellects this spirit. It is appropriate that 
such a campus should nunure, and help 
develop, a dance form that too is a 
pioneer. 

With over 800 students, nine faculty 
members, 27 classes and bounds of 
energy, the UCSD dance program is a 
force that demands to be recognized 
and accredited by (he University. "I'd 
like to see the program expand," says 
Wasmuth, summarizing the attitude of 
the dance minor goes through. We have 
the teaching quality and Sludent 
enthusiasm to make it a strong program 
and minor." Hyre says, "It would be an 
acknowledgement, on the University'S 
pan, of the work that people have put 
in, and of the fact that dance IS a 
legitimate pursuit." 

representation IS based on the input 
from only 10-20% of the group it affects, 
so EAR has begun ItS first step In 
contacting the workers themselves. The 
Lkmoaat reponed that "decenificauon 
petitions" have becn circulated at UCD, 
and approXimately 6,000 (30%) of the 
dencal workers' signatures are 
necessary. 11 the petition is accepted by 
the Public Employment Relauons Board 
(PERB), the election could be held 
again 

Wlgham told the dcncal workers, 
"We're stuck In the middle. We can't get 
help from the UniverSIty or the union," 
the £)c/ll()("at reported. 

Bolrnes told the Dcnw<. rat that EAR's 
upnslng IS "Irrnating as hell."

Art as communication 
"To believe gout· own thought to belieue IMt what is tlUe {or you in 
your prlua~ hurt is true for all, tIYt is genius." 

- Ralph Waldo fmel30n 
Iy JA. JllAmlSOft 

Art as the attempt at Inventing a pmonallanguage for understanding 
the human creative force appears to be lost In modem society. The 
concern for facts and techniques overshadows Intuitive expression. 
Copyists abound In the art world who look outward for formulas and 
Inspiration to ensure a "great" work of art. Too Infrequently does 
illumination corne 110m Inner resources and personal Insights. Above all. 
the role of the artist should be one of preserving and uhIbltlng the 
presence of the unconscious intuitive coUective splrft of man. 

This Inborn knowlege Is In everyone. but It Is the artist who. through 
exloratlve visual means. looks at his being and searches for his personal 
essence and then Is compelled to express It In physical ways, such as 
painting, sculpture, performance. poetry, etc. Too often, artists do not 
exhibit the dlaclpllne, patience. courage or will It takes to reach the 
depths of the soul and express self awareness for the beneftt of others. 

~ploring the art experience Is a great advatture. one that Is not always 
sought. Many artists are content In ftndIng new gimmicks and then 
cleverly producing them In a dlsgubed form called art. Stili others cut 
short their vision and repeat a single solution as If they are on treadmills 
going nowbere. All is not lost. though. In these types of artists. Other 
more Insightful ones can learn from them and elthr.r pick up where they 
leave off or become aware of what they ought not to do. 

ror art to truly IUnction as I positive lnftuace for mankind. theR 
mu.st be a now of creatJft dialog between all. for each hasa contribution 
to make. no matter how small or confused his statement. Instead of this 
philosophical discussion and sharing of Insights. there is I ften:e 
competition between artists who strIw: to Invent the "new" style that will 
ensure exposure and sales In the business world 0I.1t. This SJ!leID has to 
be torn before trust and camaraderie between artists can deRlop tbdr 
art work as an Inlqp'al step In the .ttalnme. of IncUYlduaI genius.

promoter and Junior partner of 
Southland Concerts, In a recent 
interview. 

MusIc almost seems to be a 
secondary concern in the world 
of concert promotion. As In 
many other types of business, 
contJacts, negotiations, labor 
relations. rental fees, agents, 
artists' fees and Some assigned 
risks make up a large part of the 
concert promotion business. In 
some instances It Is a very 
lucrative business, but it Is also 
highly competitive, costly and a 
financially risky undertaking. A 
show can run from a few 
thousand dollars to several 
hundred thousand dollars for 
some of the "'*" touring acb-
In the end, It is the llnanclal risk 
taken by promoters that 
detennines what concerts the 
audiences will be able to see In

A couple of jolly good plays

By JOM rOlSKRG 
What happens when a group 

of zany characters gathers at a 
rundown country manor 
Inhabited by a promiscuous 
ghost? Playwright Alan 
Ayckboum rev. the answer 
In his hilarious farce Tlking 
Steps. currently playing at the 
Old Globe Thea~. 

Ayckboum assembles a 
seductive would-be dancer, her 
harcHlrlnking tycoon husband, 
the wife's dulJ-wftted brother 
and his woeful ftancec, a 
bumbling solicitor and the 
landlord of the mansion, which 
previously served as a brothel, 
for a wild evening of bed-
hopping revelry, 

The Nell Simon of 
contemporary BrItish theater, 
Ayckboum 15 fascinated by the 
ubiquitous quality of time. He is 

best known for bls comedies 
which Juxtapose action 
occmlng simultaneously In 
different locales Into one 
skUlfuUy-scrlpted scene, staged 
In the same playing space. The 
action of TMing S~p.s occurs 
on tIfte ftocn of the mansion, 
1be PInes. while the actors 
move ICIQIS a single-level set. 
In aeaUag these Intricate 
PIttam of physical movement, 
Ayckbourn weaves In an 
exploration of the emotional 
trends of personal relation-
ships. 

The Old Globe production of 
this wblmslcal comedyature5 
deft direction by Globe 
executive producer CraIa noel, 
strong ensemble acting and an 
appropriately shabby set 
designed by rllck Reid.

Emergency clinics offer quick, lowlcost 
medical care. 

Hospital emergency rooms offer the 
quality and security of a hospital medical staff. 

But now you don't have to choose bel 
tween them. 

Introducing Medistat TM. We're different 
from both emergency clinics and other hospi l 
tal emergem:y rooms .. . in some important ways.

Because that's when minor emergencies 
happen. Just walk in anytime, without 
an appointment. You'll be treated 
promptly and courteously at Medistat. 

YJJ'llalso betreated\Wll~~ ~ 
When payment is made by cash, 

check or major credit card at time of service, 
charges are comparable to those you'd pay at 
an emergency clinic. But at Medistat )'{)U're 
getting hospital quality medical care. 

So when you have a minor emer·

With emergency linics. you'd have to go 
to a ho pital located somewhere else.
