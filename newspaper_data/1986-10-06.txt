UC Credit Union 
• 

opens In 
By BRYAN HARRIS 

S lUdents at UCSD may soon have their own on-campus credit union 10 ated in the 
student center, if the plans of 
undergraduates Chris Moshy. 
Gonzalo Fe rradas and Doug 
Hutshing succeed. 

The three students decided to 
delay the opening of the credit 
unt on, previously slated to open 
thIS fall, unnlJanuary 1987. 
Moshy explained. 'We're taking 
more time to do things righ t." He 
added, "It's pretty ea to form a 
credit unio n, but you need to be 
really defined in what your 
servIces wdl be. You want to be 
successful in aU of them." 

The mitial services olTered by 
the credit union will be a savi ngs 
a COUnt program and loans 
deSigned for students. Ferradas 
said, "Services will be expanded 
to include checking accounts 
once the c redit union IS firmly 
estabhshed ." But Moshy 
cautioned, -We're not here to 
compete with Secun tY Pacifi c." 

Whlle the benefits for account 
holders hmge on convenience 
and service. Ferradas was 
adamant that "the real rewards 
will go to the credit-union staff 
- those volunteers who manage 
and run the operation ." Ferradas 
continued , -It's a unique 
opportunuy to get first-hand 
experience with running a 
financial institution . and a 
chance to work with a tight, 
efficient management team ." 

The two emphasized that stalT 
members will leam important, 
practical skiUs and also make 
contacts with fmancial 
professionals outside the 

1987 
university. Moshy said . "The 
primary goal of the cred it union 
is to be educatIonal as weU as 
functionaL" 

A cording to Moshy, there IS 
an "enormous amount of 
knowledge and backing. 
including a 10 000 base to bUIld 
upon. The biggest problem, 
Ferradas pOinted out , IS in 
"assembling an intellIgent, 
in nOI'ative group of student5 to 
org,lnlu the programs and 
propel the credit union ,. 
Ferradas stre ~ed . "Be au 'e we 
arc deahng with peoplcs' monel" 
the management must be totaUv 
professional ,. 

Mosh)' echoed these concerns. 
"It's hard to find motivated 
people who are serious about 
getting th ings started and 
accepting the responslbihty" 

Despitc thIS need for student 
input , many steps have already 
been taken . Ferradas, Hutshmg 
and Moshy Just returned from a 
conference in an FranCISCo 
where 14 student credit unions 
from across the narion shared 
their expenlse Rob Le\l"b, the A 
commissioner for the Untversll)' 
Center, is workmg to secure a 
location for the credit union In 
thc old, student center, Mosh)' 
said . 

Students Interested in learning 
professional sktlb, working with 
their peers to gJ) n practical 
knowledge and building t lelr 
resumes can learn more about 
the credi t unt on at the multi-
purpose room In the Student 
Center Thursday night at 7 pm. 
Other questions an be dIrected 
to Moshy, Hutshlng or 
Ferradas. ~

Gann measure threatens UC academic future 
By ANTIGONE GANAKIS, News Editor 

A recent ballot initiative qualified personnel for many sponsored by anti-tax ~ars to COme, crusader Paul Gann has 
been penned "the most drastic 
public spending measure since 
Proposition 13." 

The California Public Pay 
Umit Inttiative, a measure that 
would place a $65,000 cap on 
university professors, 
administrators and other public 
om ci als, wou ld red uce th e 
University of California to a 
"second-ra te institution", saId 
UC PreSident David Gardner in 
a recent interview with the Daily 
Cahfomllln, 

The measure would fut a pay 
limIt on the majority 0 state 
employees Induding Govemor 
DeukmeJlan whose current salary 
would be reduced to 'lj80,OOO. 

maintained an opinion that the 
measure would not affect the 

university. but UC offtclJIs are 
"still n(:t conVinced ." 

[n June the UC Board of 
Regents opposed the measure in 
a vote after Gardner told them it 
would have a "devastating effect" 
on the university's personnel and 
programs. 

Atkinson agreed with 
Gardner's assumption Slating that 
if passed the initiative would "be 
the most destructive measure in 
the history of the state of 
California ." 

There are also a great number 
of groups who are concemed 
about the Gann initlallve 
prOVIsions that would require 
that public emloyees no longer 
accrue vacation and SIck leave 
beyond one year. 

The measure also states that 
between November 5, when the 
lmtianve may pass. and January 
I. 1987, all CalifornIa publac 

agenices must buy Out their 
employees' accrued annual 
vacations and sick leaves. 

According to the state 
legislation analyst's office , the 
buyout would cost the state a 
total of $7 billion. 

Kolb also stated that it would 
cost the University of California 
$323 million to buyout 
employees' accrued annual 
vacation and sick leaves. 

Critics charge that the 
measure would encourage the 
abuse of sick leave . 

"Everyone will take a long 
vacation and then they'll get an 
offer (from an out of state 
Institution) and go: said UCSD 
Political Science Department 
ChaIr Tracy Strong.

C alifornia voters face a major challenge in sorting through claims and 
counterc laims about the 
initiatives on the ballot. Since an 
initiative is essentially cast in 
co ncrete once it is passed , it 
should be clear and 
straightforward in its purpose 
and effects, with few hidden 
costs and potentially complex 
problems. 

Legislative Analyst says that 
Proposi tion 61 could cost 
taxpayers $ 7 billiol1 . It purportS 10 
deal with public pensions, but it 
does nol. The large pe nsions 
bei ng collected by some former 
public offi cials will actually 
increase under Proposition 61. 

Propos ition 61 - the unfair 
pa y limitation measu~ on the 
November ballot - fails that test 
miserably. It is supposed to save 
taxpayers money, but it wi ll nol. 
It will cost taxpayers money. The

Proposition 61 will virtually

most important in my estimation

pension reduction measure. It is 
nothing of the sorl. A handful of 
former state officials are eligible 
for exorbitant pensiO;!ls because 
of a fo rmula basing their 
pensions on present-day salaries. 
they now receive much more 
than they ever· did in salary. The 
obvio us way 10 solve the pension 
problem is to cut the li nk 
between pension benefits and 
current salaries. Proposition 57 
on th e November ballot does 
this. It will put an end to 
outrageous pe ns ions, but Paul 
Gann opposes il. Proposition 61 
places amitrary and unrealistic 
limits on the salary and 
co mpensation of every public 
employee. It would cut the salary 

It affects all employees by 
prohibiting the carry-over of 
earned sick leave and vacation 
time from one year to the next. 
The Legislative Analyst estimates 
the COSt of "buying out" these 
already·eamed benefits at ';7 
billion statewide - far, fat more 
than th is ill-conceived measure 
could ever possibly save. 

This "use it or lose it" 
provision would lead 10 
considerable employee 
absenteeism; even the most 
co nscienllous employee will use 
his SIck leave If it cannot be 
carried over. It will be impossible 

PropOSitiOn 61 would have a 
profoundly negative effect on our 
sc hools. - an effect that our 
children would ultimately bear. 

It would encourage teachers to 
use up sick leave they would 
otherwise save. If all teachers 
took only four extra sick days 
per year. the COSt of substitutes 
would amount to ';45 million 
annually. Substitute teachers 
cannot provide the same level o f 
instruction as regular teachers. 
We would be saddled with

Practice 
Makes Perfect 

In Navy Medicine the emphasis is on patients, not 
paperwork. 

As a Navy doctor you step into an 
active and challenging group 
practice, You work with state-of-the-
an equipment and the best facilities 
available. 

Highly trained physician's 
assitants, hospital corpsmen, 
nurses and hospital administrators 
not only provide medical suppon, 
they attend to almost all the :-
paperwork. As a result, you're free 
to make medical decisions based 
solely on the needs of your 
patients. 

Along with your professional development, you11 enjoy the 
lifestyle and fringe benefits of a Navy officer, Beginning 
salaries are competitive with civilian practice for most 
specialists,

However, given the present

below the $65,000 threshold, 
Cri tics charge that in order to 
maintam the difference between 
top supervisors and their 
assistants, salary scales for all 
employees would be pushed 
downward. 

Atkinson noted that the salary 
difference that separates obel 
Laureate from associate 
professors would be eliminated 
and that the University would 
"no longer be able to offer a top 
salary that comes from having 
worked at the Universiry for 
many years," 

"You an't recruit senior 
people in surgery or computer 
science:' added Atkinson, 

The Universiry maintains that 
if Proposition 61 passes, UC may 
lose its tOP professors to other 
higher payi ng institutions, 

"Sure UCSD is prestigious, But 
if a certain hypothetical 
professor gets a call from the 
University of Ill inois, which is 
not as good as our institution, 
but will cominue to give ra ises, it 
makes economic sense for a 
professor to leave," said Strong, 
He added, "I'm very close to

and I'm sure that I could speak 
for others," 

According to Randy McNames, 
senior accountant of the UCSD 
payroll division, the highest 
salary of a UCSD professor is 
about ~200,OOO for medical 
school professors, 

"Full professors can earn up to

The ncxt Jay, the paper 
rcponed that 2 mIllion MexI an 
afictonados were involved in the 
fiesta (only two people were 
killed). But the seduction of the 
World Cup and the trigger for all 
this paSSion is ltS basis of 
nationalistic prrde. When 
Argentina played England , ull 
one English rooter could say was 
"we're gonna kick Maradona's ass! " 
But in the Falkland Islands 
rematch, Maradona was dazzling. 
"This is the greatest day of my 
life ," said a teary eyed Argentine. 
"Mayall of England go to hell ." 

Italy, after it's quarterfinals loss 
to France , stirred up similar 
passions. "I'm normally a calm 
person ," satd an Italian man after 
the game ," but if I were in Italy. I 
would get my gun and shoot 
everyone of those bastards." 

As far as sporting cvents go, 
nothing can compare WIth the 
World Cup (not even the Super 
Bowl or World Serres). ~

I became frusmlted , gett ing

"Do you speak Engli sh ?" and the 
pe rson said , ' Why should It

take care of it when I get horne. 

That proved to be no better. 
The American Express people 
tried 10 put the blame firs t on

Women's volleyball remains 
number one in the nation 

Janel Hughes climbs lhe ladder Jor the hill agalnSI Occidental. 

Heidi Maier role 
player par excellence 
By LYNNE MCLEVlE 

SHE was standing on the sidelines watching her team pound on theIr opponents, 
waIting until it was her time to 
go into the game. This waiting 
routine is nothing new for Heidi 
Maier. 

She is a substitute player on 
the women's volleyball team. It's 
not as bad as it may seem 
though , since she has gone from 
last man (or woman that IS) last 
year, to backrow speclahst this 
year. Who knows what may 
happen next year? 

seemg that Coach Dannevlk 
rec ruits most of his ei rls from 
high school. 

In fact, she was CUI from the 
team the firs! year on the la t 
day of tryOUts. The next day one 
of the girls that Dannevik chose 
for the team, quit. So Maler was 
called back and her career on 
the UCSD team began. 

The first year was one of 
learning. Coming from a poor 
fundamentals background , she 
had much to learn before she 
could get a good position on the 
team. She explams, "' really 
learned a lot from Dannevtk. 
When , came here my footwork 
was backwards." WIth a lot of 
coaching and pracuce on such 
boring things as footwork , Maier 
has earned herself a more 
mteresting role . 

U CSD women's volleyball team returned home after pos ting impressive wins 
over Occidental, Westmont and 
Chapman College. The Tritons 
are currently 23-3 and remain 
the number one Division III team 
in the nation. According to 
UCSD head coach Doug 
Dannevik, the way UCSD has 
been playing as of late, it's a 
ranking they deserve. 

"Right now, I th ink we are the 
number one team in the nation 
and it is conceivable that we'll go 
undefeated the rest of the 
season, although we do have 
some very tough matches up 
ahead: saId Dannevik. 

UCSD solidifi ed its number 
one spot Wednesday night in 
what Dannevik referred to their 
win as a "throwaway" game. "( 
knew Occidental wasn't very 
good , so I gave a few of my 
starters a rest and it gave 
everybody a chance to play." 

UCSD's next oppOnent was 
Westmont College and the 
Tri tons came away with a 15- 11 , 

15- 11, 13-15, 15-7 win in front 
of a loud Westmont crowd . "This 
was a nothing game for us and 
we played well ," said Dannevik. 
"We had them 14-8 twice and 
we friuered away some points, 
but we generally played well ." 

Janet Hughes contributed 13 
kills and both Monica Bradley 
and Diana Klintworth tallied 12 
kills . Kim Stonecipher had 51 
assists , but Triton -serving 
amassed 16 aces. 

The match that had Dannevik 
a little worried was the Tritons 
Saturday night match against the 
Division II Chapman College. At 

the La Jolla Invltational, the 
Panthers played kitty kat in the 
rubber game and squandered a 
12-5 lead to lose to UCSD in the 
semifinal match. UCSD had 
beaten them twice, but this time 
around it was not as close as 
expected . 

"We played much better this 
time around than when we last 
played them ," said Dannevik. 
"We served well, we had a 
balanced offense. and we played 
real well o n defense, and dug 
better than we have all year. 
We're starting to play real solid 
volleyball ." 

Dannevik feels his team is 
playing like the number one 
team in the nation , but is 
suspeCt of the teams that fo llow 
in the polls'"Tcams like Eastern 
Connecticut are 17-1 playing 
teams like Occidental. I think th e 
teams who'll be in it at the end 
of the year are Elmhurst and 
Juniata along with us, LaVerne, 
Menlo College and Colorado 
College from our region ." 

-Gus Santoyo 

Maier comes from Dana Hills 
High School in San Juan 
Capistrano. She came to UCSD 
to get an education , and once 
here she decided to try out for 
the volleyball team . "I just 
decided to try out and see, 
'cause I really liked plaYing In 
high schoo\." It is unusual for a 
walk-on tryout to make the team, 

She spends lime on the coun 
and lime on the bench. What IS

Heidi Maier 

Maier 
Continued from page 12 
so unusual about her is the way 
that he spends her time on the 
bench - Wisely. Instead of 
situng there wishi ng that she 
was playing, she encourages 
those th at are on th e noor. As 
Dan nevik pOinted out, "Every 
team needs people on the bench 
that are going to be pos itive." 

It seems that one of he r roles 
on the team is that o f the team 
"sparker: one that keeps the 
team going during tough times 
and always seems to be positive 
and have the right things to say. 
After talking to Coach Dannevik 
and Janet Hughes (one of the 
star blockers), anyone can see 
tnat Maier's positivism is 
catching. All that is to be heard 
about her are words of praise 
about her attitude and her play. 

Hughes explains, "She is so 
uplifting, she's always gOt 
something positive to say." 
Maier's reason for being so 
encouraging she says is that "it 
seems like when evetyone's 
having fun , they're playing good 
too.!) 

This year, Maier is a "backrow 
specialist. " She comes in for 
Janet Hughes and Monica 
Bradley when they get into the 
backrow. But, as Dannevik said , 
"It 's not Just a token substitution . 
She really deserves to be in 
there ." As Kim Stonecipher (a 
starter on the team) explamed, 
"BaSically, her Job is to touch as 
many balls as possible." That 
sounds like a tall job desc ription ! 

Bei ng a subst itute player may 
not scem very glamorous, but 
considering that she is gOi ng 
into the game for two potential 
All -Americans, doing such a good 
Job IS quite impressive. 

The other gIrls have 
onfidcnce in her. Hughes 

expressed this confidence when 
she sa id, "I'm glad to go out, 
because I know she can do a hell 
of a be tter Job than I can." 
Hughes' strength is middle 
blocking. he obviously feels that 
Maier can do a better job in the 
backrow 

On a team thal is 15-2, with 
some highly experi enced players, 
It can take some time to move to 
a starung pos ition and Maier has 
that time. She IS only a 
sophomore at Muir College and 
only III the mIddle of her second 
nllcgc ,cason In the summer
