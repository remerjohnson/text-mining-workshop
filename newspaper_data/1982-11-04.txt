Election results: 
• • • peSSIOllsm runs 

the rampage 
The election results are in, unfortunately. T he 

overwhelmingly negative results on all of the 
propositions requiring change, such as 15, 14, 13 and 
11 indicate a distinct social direction. We are 
disappearing in a haze of pessimism, perhaps 
rece ion·induced. We are afraid of change. 

Proposition 15 lost, even though supported by the 
mayors and police chiefs of most of California's major 
cities. Handguns, used for little besides shooting 
human beings, or perhap target practice in case you 
ever need to shoot a human. will remain abundant 
and accessible in this tate. Though rifles and 
s hotguns, osten ibly useful guns, remained 
unaffected by the proposition , the people were 
convinced, at great expense, that their constitutional 
rights were being taken away. The police, of course, 
merely continue to work over-time combating street 
crime. 

Proposition Illost. Why? Wedonot understand the 
defeat of the recycling initiative. Can it be that the 
people were 0 utterly convinced by the surface 
wisdom of their shopping bags that they neglected to 
think of the environment? Even though the rhetoric of 
the bottler and supermarkets was obviously 
shallow, the voters went with the money. We pity the 
CalPirg workers, who pent so much time in vain. 

Pro po ition 13, another environmental i sue, also 
10 t. It wa reputed to be confusing, at least by those 
who hadn 't read it. Prop. 14 lost, because the power-
broker in organizec political parties could never 
upport local control over local candidate's district. 
Jerry Brown 10 t to bland Pete Wilson: how could 

thi happen? The nation's p~~pntial fir t black 
governor lost. People say Bradley 10 t becaus~ we 
aren't ready for a black governor. We are afraId of 
change. 

At least the nuclear freeze initiative won. Then 
again, it is symbolic. and won't necessarily change 
anything anyway.

Letter to the Editor 

Chilean rights speaker censored

I attended the film Missing

lecture by Thomas Hauser, 
which were sponsored by the 
University Events Office and 
the Committee for Wor ld 
Democracy with ASUCSD 
funds. The event was 
informative and interesting, 
and a large group of people 
were in attenda nce . The

But a more important 
problem arose towards t he end 
of the program, after the

A spokeswoman from a

was speaki ng on current

which led to the overthrow of 
the freely elected government 
of Salvador Allende in Chile in 
1973. Abou t three or four 
minutes into her speech the

and then her microphone was

Lack of confidence in government 
B1a~~~~:: fe~~~E 

Early on in the Reagan 
administrat ion a fear set in 
that the world's leader no 
longer were able to control 
their growing nu clear 
arsenals. Soon his was joined 
by a second fe 1r: that maybe 
the best mac1inery of the 
national and global economies 
was slipping ,lUI of control. 
The Tylenol ! care ha ' now 
highlighted a t ;,ird fear' I h~t 
here, too. g( vernment no 
longer can -afeguard the 
complex rang ' of material 
su bstances, flom d rugs to 
drinking water, on which our 
con umer society dppends. 

What make:; these macro 
anxieties so ominous is that 
they have come together with 
people's deepest forebodings 
about their futures - their 
ability to earn a li vi ng, stay 
healthy and protect them· 
selves from the ravages of 
crime and war. 

At the root of this pessimi m 
is a profound cri sis of 
confidence in government. 
While politicians debate 
whether government hould 
do more or les!', many ordinary 
citizen ' wonder whether 
government can do anything 
positive but talk . One telltale 
sign is the ever·declining 
number of people who bother 
to vote. U.S. News & World 
Repor! predicts a voter turnout 
in November of 33 percent . 
lower lildl! th~ :, ll.tirne low of 
34.5 percent in 1980. Another 
sig n ' is the per sistent 
reluctance of people to spend 
money. even those with plenty 
of cash to spend. 

What this pervasive 
pessimism suggests, just a 
year or so away from 19R4 , is 
that we may be moving not 
towa rds the Rig Brother 
totalitarian st ate George 
Orwell predicted but tOwards 
a final divorce of people from 
government. A politicians 

fu m ble and bicker at home and 
fight abroad. more and more 
people slide back into the 
pursuit of their own survival 
and hope for the best, adopting 
the attitude of peoples 
everywhere for 4,000 years: 
that the further away 
government is, the better off 
they are. 

What , in fact, ca n 
government do? The most 
decisive step it can take is to 
roll back the public's fear of 
nuclear war by signing a 
credible arms control accord. 
Such a move - a strong show 
of government's confidence in 
it elf - wou ld be a vital means 
to an even more vital end -
restoring some fI ickerof pu blic 
optimism about the future 
beyond the one people create 
for themse lves. Ironica ll y, 
without that flicker of hope, 
government's own efforts to 
grapp le with economic, 
environmental a nd even 
foreign crises will go nowhere.

Are \Ve a nation w-hich is easily bored?

T hey say we need electronic 
games and video recorder and 
Walkman stereos to entertain 
us w herever we go. That is 
because, they say, we are a 

exploration wou ld be Carl's 
fat her's Buick and not a 
schooner. The word gave us a 
sense of drllma and mission . 

We got out t he maps and 
plotted our course. We figured 
we could do it for $20 plus gas. 

A few hour later. we were 
on the road. 

That would be impossible 
now, even unthinkable. I 
reali ze. Now there are 
respon ibilitie to meet and 
arrangements to make and the 

putting of your house in order 
before you can just pack up 
and leave. 

But back then , there was 
on ly us and the road. 

And the best part of it. 
really, was what happened 

I was navigating that day-
my lap was heaped high with 
maps and guideoooks - and I

Pine." 

I do not remember our 
precise conver at ion , but ince 
sarcasm is the universal 
language of college s tudents, it 
must have gone omethinglike 
this: 

"And what do you suppo e a 
Gen. MacArthur Pine i ?" 

"A tree that looks like Gen. 
MacArthur? A treewhitt[ed by 
Gen. MacArthur? A tree in 
which Gen. MacArthur is 
buried?" 

"In other word, a sight not

"To be sure." 
"Of course." 
It was at [east a hundred 

miles out of our way, maybe 
farther, but we turned toward 
it without hesitation . 

The touri t season was 

ending and th e two· lane 
blacktop wa empty in both 
direct ion s. The fores t got 
denser and denser, growing up 
to the edge of f he roadway. 
The pines formed a canopy 
over our heads and the 'sun 
could be seen flashing briefly 
between the branches. 

We fell s ilent in the car , 
almost as if we had entered a 
church, and soon all we could 
hear was t he whisper of the 
trees in t he wind and the hiss 
of our tires against the 
highway. 

We came upon it suddenly; it 
rested on little more than a 
wide place in the road. We 
pulled over and walked acros 
the pine needles to where it 
stood. There wa no one el e 
around. 

The li t tle ign aid it wa 
the tallest w hite pine in the 

world, 140 feet high. It had 
been discovered by a U.S. 
forest ranger in ] 945 and he 
nam ed it af ter Douglas 
MacArthur, the hero of the 
Pacific who was al so a 
Wi cons in native. It was 
thought to be 400 years old . 

I had never thought of trees 
as ' ometh ing you could 
"discover" or how exactly you 
determined which tree is the 
tallest. But we looked at it for a 
long while. 

It didn't do anything. Tree 
rarely do, But when, without a 
word, we got back in the car, 
we left with an odd feeling of 
satis faction, 

Thi happened more than a 
dozen years ago, and it was 
that trip to Wisconsin the 
other day to make a speech 
that reminded me.

Tom Metzger, why did you

Every important choice [

Nuclear Freeze initiative. 

I may be a fool to ay it, but I 
honest ly thought the bottle bill 
was going to pass. Even 
though all of the s tores in the 
area were waging shopping 
bag propaganda wars against 
poor, innocent consumers like 
myself, I just assumed that we 
wo uld all vote for a 
progressive, envi ronmentally 
sou nd proposition. 

This is cool California, we

How many people have been

Did you ee any rats in the 
supermarket ? I didn 't. 

I don 't know, it just doesn't 
make sense. 

The real shocks for me were 
the victories of Pete Wilson 
a nd Geo rge Deukmejian, 
possibly because these are 
men a nd not mere abstract 
issues. Maybe r wasn't closely 
following the pre -election 

coverage of the candidates, but 
I was very confident in 
Brad[ey's victory, and fairly 
confident in Brown's. I really 
cou ld not believe my radio in 
the morning, and kept hoping 
all day long that the results 
were wrong. 

Some elections, it 's the 
uncertainty that kills you. 
This time, I was s hot down by 
my certainty. Voting was a 
pleasure. I act ually sauntered 
into the polling place and 
happi ly turned on my radio in 
the morning. Only to lose, and 
heavily at that. 

I guess it a ll re ulted from a 
combination of naivete, poor 
concentration and bad luck_ I 
was n'l ready to believe that 
money could so blatantly buy 
votes, as in Props. 11 and 15, or 
thaI Reagan·like Republica ns 
could carry the ball when the 
whole country knows that 
Reagan is nll t a good presiden t. 

In reality , of course, the

don't care much. Most of the 
people, my, elf included , just

speak out 
continued from page 1 

For decade , for instance, 
ret ired cleaning woman Tsuyo 
Katoaka, 61. felt the atom 
bomb "was the will of God, 
who sacrificed us to bring 
peace." 

When the bomb fell on her 
home town of Nagasaki , the 
direct heat ray s burned 
Kataoka's clothes from her 
body and temporary blindness 
prevented her from c;eeing the 
destruction of the city for 
weeks. 

" That atom bomb gave 
enough agonies to all of us," 
she ays. " It shouldn't be 
allowed to happen to someone 
else_" 

phu/" by I'IIll1lp Do"ICS 

Today Kataoka lives alone 
in a warren· like hill ide 
neighbor hood overlooking a 
rebuilt city . "Of course I never 
married," she continues, 
looking up at her visitor and 
expo ing a face twisted and 
scarred by radiation burns. 
Yet Kataoka, too, recently has 
developed a fresh perspective 
on the event. 

San Diego's Pete Wilson hides the tip of his nose from reporters following a s peech to 
supporters after his election to the U.S. Senate. 

Kataoka was among tho e 
Japanese who believed the 
deaths for firebombing and 
especially from the atom 
bombs were a kind of di vine 
retribution for Japan 's 
wartime actions, or even for 
personal "sins." The belief 
was espec iall y strong in 
Nagasaki , home of Japan 's 
largest Christian community. 
But the fatalistic notion was 
held in other versions by non-
Christians too, and pre-
empted any involvement 
among those who believed it. 

During Pope John Paul's 
visit to Hiro hima and 
Nagasaki last year, however, 
he told the Japanese that the 
attitude was not only bad 
theology, but a good way to 
invite another holocau t. 

"War is the work of man ," 
said the pope. "The waging of 
war is not inevitable or 
unchangeable ... (There) is no 

ju tification for not ris ing the 
question of there pons ibiltyof 
each nation and of each 
individual in the face of 
pos ible wars and of the 
nuclear threat. " 

Says Kataoka: "When I 
heard the pope say war was up 
to man , I thought, ' Well, 
maybe there is something I can 
d '" o. 

Kataoka began to give 
newspaper and TV interv iews 
as a Jzibakusha , and she joined 
the "Ten Feet Movement," a 
popular national campaign to 
raise questions about nuclear 
war. The movement uses film 
footage from the US 
go vernment relating to 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Like 
Kataoka, who discovered her 
own picture in a portion of 
documentary footage which 
was used to make one of the 
completed films , tens of 
thou ands of mem ber 
contribute to buy 10 feet each 
of raw film from Washington. 

The films are one way, 
campaign organizers ay, to 
reach teen-agers and young

United States and Europe_ 

Calligraphy teacher Hiromo 
Morishita was a you ng teen· 
ager himself when the bomb 
fell. He was standing near a 
river 1.5 kilometers from the 
blast's hypocenter. "[ tried fo r 
several years not to think 
about my scars," he says, but 
s tudents and others asked how 
he got them, and eventually 
Morishita talked. Today he 
says he makes a special effort 
to keep the memories fresh so 
he can recount them vividly to 
hi student . 

" ) came across a group of 
oldiers whos e s kin was 

completely peeled off, like 
reptiles, below their cap 
line ," he recalls. 

InJ apan, laments Mori hit a. 
"teen-agers are gener a ll y 
apathetic to anything outs ide 
t he cla ss room beca u e 
s tudying for the comprehen-
sive high school exam is their 
only life. " 

Yet he is proud of a widely 

pu blicized project in which 
hundreds of students have 
unearthed melted roof tiles 
from along the city's river 
ba nk . determined the 
temperat ure necessary to 
melt them, calculated the 
effects of those temperatures 
on the human body and, a 
Moris hita puts it "analyzed 
the resul ts in their own 
terms." 

Morishita and the other 
hibakus/za now speaki ng out 
don't consider themselves 
"chosen people," and 
general ly shy away from tho e 
who want to put them center 
stage at peace rallies and 
forums. Indeed, coming out of 
the atom ic closet is not an easy 
step: Respected. as the unique 
heart of the Japanese peace 
movement , they also are 
ostracized - perhaps out of 
fear they ca rry genet ic 
damage , or because of 
recurring illne sses, or 
u pic ion by employers that 

they may uddenl y become ill 
- and often they are without

They proposed .hat a free and 
public exchange of opinions 
between the two great powers 
would result in the liquidation 
of nuclear weapons and the 
reduction of conventional 
arms. To facilitate this 
dialogue, they suggested 
reciprocal visits from all strata 
of society and Soviet/Ameri-
can television debates 
screened in both countries. 

Stressing that they were not 
dissidents and that their 
activities were not directed 
against Soviet authorities,

building measures between 
America and the Soviet Union. 

The official response to this 
effort was swift. The two 
leading figures in the group, 
Sergei Batovrin, an artist and 
son of a Soviet diplomat, and 
Sergei Rosenauer, a mathema-
tician, were detained and told 
that all such groups had to 
register with authorities . 
Another member, Vladmir 
Fleischbakker, was threat-
ened with prosecution. Those 
individuals who signed a 
petition supporting this effort 
were informed that their 
university status was subject. 
to review. 

A comparable situation 
occurred in East Germany this 
past spring. For months 
tensions had been rising 
between church and state. 
Since 1978 the Lutheran 
Church has protested the 
compulsory military training 
in schools for 14- and IS-year 
olds and the involvement of 
the Society for Sport and 
Technology (a youth group) in 
paramilitary training for 
youths and young men. 

As a con equence of their 
concern over the mili tariza-
tion of East German society 
and the threat of war , 
individu:.Us within the church 
began wearing a patch 
depicting the biblical word , 
"They shall beat their sword 
into plowshares." 

Reacting to the church's 
oppo ition to state policy, 
Klaus Gysi, state secretary for 
church affairs, informed 
Lutheran Church officials 
that the patch no longer was 
acceptable. The church then

word from UEO ~. 
Concerts and their lack of have been a great topic for articles. 

conversations. gossip and hard feelings at UCSD. The University II1II.... 
Events Office Is the organization that brings most all the concerts ~ 
programmed to campus and aids in the programming of the rest. 
this office is staffed by a very enthusiastic and competent staff who 
give their all to ensure smooth running events. 

The events put on by UEO can be divided into several 
departments such as Pop Events. Special Events. Dance and Drama. 
film. Music, and Lecture Series. These programs are all registration 
fee funded and therefore are presented for all students at student 
prices. These programs are all chaired and run by volunteer 
students with special interests in each field. Any student canjoin 
these committees. give their input. and ~et activelv involved. 

For example. the Pop Events Committee is run by a dedicated 
group of 45 students interested in popular music - Rock. Jazz, 
New Wave. etc. It works as follows: the committee is given a sum of 
money to last the entire programming year. This committee meets 
and decides what shows it would like to put on and reviews the 
proposed budget. This budget is structured around the performer's 
fee. sound and lights. facility fee. publicity. technical crew. and 
other costs of putting on a show. Because these expenses are 
tremendous. the committee encourages and seeks outside 
promoters who are willing to take the financial risk. These outside 
promoters can provide more programming options. 

The problem with programming is not a lack or Shows. but a lack 
of an adequate facility to put the show. lately there have been some 
great opportunities for UEO and outside promoters to bring hard-
to-get. very exciting shows to campus. UEO had to tum down these 
shows due to this lack of programming space which. in tum, is 
really hurting the students. Mandeville is a very expensive hall to 
use. plus it is limited to jazz and other mellow acts. The gym is 
usually booked with P.E. classes and intercollegiate sports. In 
addition. the Gym limits UEO to one weeknight a quarter. which 
must be reserved before the start of that quarter. Therefore the 
committee is sev.erely bound by this lack of a proper concert 
facility. 

What this university needs is a facility capable of handling large 
shows. There is a committee now forming to geta facility builtthat 
would be capable for the purpose of holding concerts on campus.

An exhibition entitled Young 
American Artists: Amdur. 
Budgett. Rice and Robbins wil 
open at the Mandeville Art 
Gallery at 5 p.m. Friday. with a 
public reception for the artists 
in the gallery. 

This show features the works 
of one pa inter and three 
installation artists. all of them 
young Americans who received 
M.f.A. degrees last spring. 

MaTgery Amdur. a graduate of 
the University of Wisconsin. will 
install her autobiographical 
piece . " A Thirteen Year 
Obsession for My Main 
Attraction," Amdur said of her 
work that it "transforms a 
concept of personal obsessive-
ness into the form of a visual 
puzzle which appears to be 
unresolved - as if many of the 
pieces got lost in the shuffle. It 
is this reorganizing that 
promotes new and challenging 
work. " 

Graham Budgett (Stanford ) 
will exhibit six culptural works 
with the addition of two-
dimensional images and texts 
that will form the basis of one 
installation. 

Dan Rice (UC Davis) will 
exhibit five painting at lhe 
Mandeville Art Gallery: "Year of 
Our lord ," " Aulorama ," 
"Driving Me Up a Wall " and 

" Intersection " Nos. 2 and 3 .. My 
paintings reflect my percep-
tions of the contemporary 
American way of life." Rice said. 
" They deal with symbols 
abstracted from OUT economy. 
transportation . national 
defense. technology. religion 
and government." 

Rice is currently working in 
the artist-in-residence program 
at the Fine Arts Work Center in 
Provincetown. Massachusetts. 
He has gained local recognition 
from his commission to paint an 
outdoor mural in the Gaslamp 
Quarter of San Diego. 

"They Say God is a Man" is the 
name of the installation by Gary 
Robbins (Washington Univer-
sity. st. lDuis). Wood. cardboard 
cut-outs and black curtains are 
the materials of this 
installation. which Robbins says 
are intended "to create a 
religious atmosphere ". to 
convey a cryptic feeling of the 
falling of mankind throughout 
time: ' An original soundtrack 
and theatrical lighting will be 
used to make Robbins ' 
installation a total experience. 

Young American Artists: 
Amdur. BudgetL RIce and 
Robbins will be on view at UCSD 
through December 5, 1982. 
Gallery hours are noon to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday through Sunday.

The bewildered cast of the u Jolla Stage Company's presentation of Agatha (hris~'s "l'Iousetrap". 

IJ group presents 'Mousetrap' 
By JOAN fORSBt:RG 

An unsolved murder. a 
violent snowstorm, a gloomy 
English manor house. six 
mysterious visitors. and a 
psychopathic killer are the 
elements of Agatha Christie's 
suspense thriller. Mousetrap. 
currently being presented by 

I 
the La Jolla Stage Company at 
the Parker Community 
Auditorium in l.a Jolla. 

The longest running play in 
the history of theater . 
Mousetrap was first performed 
in the Ambassador Theatre in 
London on Nov. 25. 1952. It has 
been playing continually for the 
past 30 years. Based on the 
radio sketch ' ihree Blind Mice." 
Mousetrap contains the twisted 
plots and shadowy characters 
for which Agatha Christie is well 
known. 

On the wintry eve of the 
strangulation of a lAJndon 
woman, a group of mysterious 
strangers gather at Monkswell 
Manor. a boarding house in the 
English countryside. With only 
two clues. the Manor address 
and a note containing the 

macabre nursery rhyme "Three 
Blind Mice, " the detective oFthe 
London police is sent to 
Monkswell Manor to investigate 
the crime. The veiled murderer 
appears to be among the guests. 
cautiously stalking his victims. 
The detective probes into the 
backgrounds of everyone in the 
house. trying to expose the 
murderer. 

Which of the suspects is it: 
the deranged architect, the 
agitated British socialite. the 
shady foreigner. the insolent 
artist. the stern Army major, the 
charming hostess or her 
enigmatic husband? 

The la Jolla Stage Company's 
production of Mousetrap, aptly 
directed by Christopher R. 
highlights memorable 
performances by Linda Lutz as 
Mrs. Boyle. the staunch 
socialite: laura Adrienne Moehl 
as Molly Ralston, the hospitable 
manor-house owner; and John 
flanders, a UCSD student. as 
Sergeant Trotter. the shrewd 
investigator. Stephen Storer's

Spring Session M 
l"Iissing Persons 
EMI 

By KARL DAfGUNG 
Missing Persons. the Los 

Angeles-based. new wave power 
rock band that recen tly 
performed at the gym. has 
finally released their first full 
length LP in the wake of their 
successful four song record that 
came out earlier this year. 

Missing Persons find themselves 
climbing to the top of the heap 

Dire Straits 
Love Over Gold 
Warner Brothers 

Dire Strait's fourth album. 
Love Over Gold. represents a 
substantial departure from t he 
AM radio constructed melodies 
which gave this band such a 
heralded beg inning. The 
shortest song here is over five 
minutes. Certainly not the way 
to get airplay these days. Mark 
Knopfler's credentials as a 
guitarist are well known. but his 
growth has been as a songwriter. 
His songs are no longer four 
minutes of super crafty guitar 
I icks, but rather carefully 
prepared stories that suffer on Iy 
from an occasional bit of over 
zealous production. Dire Straits 
is definitely an outfit with loads 
of talent and a unique approach. 
which makes them a VE:ry 
welcome force. 

Also new offerings from Adam Ant and Dire Straits 

Spring Session 1'1 is 
essentially a collection of 
singles. only two of the 12 songs 
on the album would not be 
suitable for standard " Album 
Oriented Rock " radio 
programming. Two songs. the 
hit single "Words" and the 
hypnotic " Destination 
Unknown" are cuts from their 
EP. entitled Missing Persons. 

The indusion of these 
previously released songs is 
completely unnecessary and 
seem to be only an attempt to 
sell more albums, These two 
songs are fine, danceable cuts. 
but they seem out of context 
with respect to the newer 
material on Spring Session 1'1. 

The rest of the album is a 
powerful fusion of heavy metal 
guitar riffs. droning and 
burbling synthesizers. solid 
bass lines and squeaky but 
catchy vocals. The force behind 
Missing Persons is drummer 
Terry Bozzio. whose riffing and 
driving rhythms power the 
album from start to finish. 
BOIZio. former Frank Zappa and 
UK drummer. shines in Missing 
Persons. He is an incredible 
technician on his instrument; 

the speed riffs and punches 
behind his rhythms are solid 
and extremely difficult to 
execute properly. All these 
elements combine to present 
Missing Persons' powerful. 
unique sound. 

The first cut on Spring 
Session 1'1. entitled "Noticeable 
One." starts the album off with a 
catchy bass line and phased 
guitar line that immediately 
catches the attention of the 
listener. " Windows." about 
regressive television watChing, 
is the strongest cut on the 
album. The vocals by new wave 
fashion queen Dale BOlZO are 
the most assured on the entire 

r~ord. 
Missing Persons has proved 

that it is not a one hit shooting 
star with this record. Look for 
some good power rock from this 
band. They have an original 
sound and powerful music that 
will impress the musician and 
entertain the rock-new wave 
oriented listener. 

Adam Ant 
friend or foe 
Epic Records 

By !'lARK Bt:IJ'lt:R 
This time around. Adam has 

exterminated his Ants and 

decided to go at it alone with 
co-writer / guitarist Marco 
Pirroni. The distortion and 
feedback that carried the 
brilliant Kings of the Wild 
frontier have given way to a 
twangy guitar sound that works 
well in some instances but fails 
in others. Adam's yelping and 
chanting cannot overcome the 
lack of vocals range or intensity

that plague this record almost 
from start to finish. 

Virtually none of the material 
here comes close to even the 
mediocre moments of Kings of 
the Wild frontier. friend or foe 
does have a couple of excellent 
tunes. " Man Called Marco" is a 
nicely layered instrumental. and 
" Made of Money" boasts the 
album's best lyrical content. 
Hopefully Adam is not past his 
creative peak, but he will have 
to do better than this mildly 
pleasurable record to be 
convincing.

Cicourel's 
imagery at 
Plan. Annex 
continued from page .1 
are purposely left blank, relying 
only on gestures for expression 
and rhythm, Only one face is 
detailed, and this is not 
Cicourel's son. but a teammate. 

There are also constructions, 
detailed and skillfully crafted, 
three-dimensional artworks. 
The best of these are 
interpretations of "cajas de San 
Marcos." folk art "boxes" from 
Mexico, originally religious in 
nature, whose doors open to 
form a triptych shape. with a 
three-dimensional scene inside. 
One has the names of soccer 
team members on the outside. 
and black cutout figures inside. 
In another "caja." Cleourel 
ventures outside the soccer 
theme back to a more 
traditional Mexican theme: a 
Catholic Mass in a San Diego 
barrio. 

Besides their Mexican 
baroque origins. the cajas try to 
capture some of the air of 
Persian miniatures. More 
Influences from non-Occidental 
sources are evident in the linear 
perspective of most of the 
pieces. as Cleoure! points out. 

Allin all. framing VariatiQns 
on a Theme is an entertaining 
exhibit put on by a talented 
artist whose enthusiasm for art 
and soccer (and the co-mingling 
of the two) has not been 
dimmed by numerous soccer 
bails rolling across the field at 
her canvasses. (eicourel 
attempts to sketch on the scene 
at soccer games. ) Cleourel 
shrugs off such hazards. saying 
that accidents as well as 
deliberate, manipulated actions 
contribute to her artwork. And 
such field-level work enables 
her to come up with particularly 
effective paintings. such as the 
one in which only the legs of the 
players are seen. actively 
pursuing the fast-moving soccer 
ball. 

Of course, it helps to know. as 
I do. that a pair of those legs 
belong to my soccer-playing 
neighbor across the street". 

The Mandeville Annex Gallery 
is located downstairs in the 
Mandeville complex. Hours are 
from noon until 5 p.m .• Monday 
through Friday. and admission 
is free. framing Variations on a

Triton baseball team ready 
for historic trip to China Athletes 

of the Week By TODD HAINES and TYNAN SCHMIDT 
The UCSD baseball team 

has a chance to make history 
as the first US baseball team, 
collegiate or professional, to 
tour the People's Republic of 
China. This announcement 
was officially made at a press 
conference Wedne s day , 
October 27, by Judith Sweet, 
Director of Intercollegiate 
Athletics at UCSD. Sweet 
proclaimed, "This is a chance 
we cannot pass up!" However, 
one thing makes the trip 
indefinite: the lack of financial 
backing. 

So far, parents of the players 
have provided half of the 
anticipated budget, but 
another $20,000 will be needed 
by this Friday. Despite the 
short time in which to acquire 
the money, Sweet and the 
promoters of the trip feel very 
optimistic that the team will 
be going on the 14-day trip, 
which begins December 11. 
Several corporations have 
shown interest in supplying 
funds fur the trip, and Sweet is 
st ill investigating internal 
sources. Chancellor Atkinson 
has also s hown a very 
favorable opinion towards the 
trip, and it was mentioned that 
if there is st ill a need for 
money, the Chancellor might 
be willing to help out. 

excellence that China is 
looking for . The Sports 
Federat ion picked UCSD 
because they were looking for 
a team composed of "student 
athletes," and according to 
David Marinoff, president of 
Expersport , "contacts and 
exchanges have made UCSD 
fairly well -known in China." 

The 21-man team wil be 
playing five games t hroughout 
mainland China. The teams 
from China, however. will not 
be collegiate . In stead. 
organized squads will be 
picked to match the biographi-
cal back~rounds - most 

important ly age - of the 
UCSD players. The trip is 
intended to promote a culture 
exchange between the two 

. cou ntries, more than to 
encourage compet ition . In 
fact , baseball is not a very 
popular s port in China, but 
because of the growing 
interest in this game. every 
match will be shown on 
Chinese television. 

The Tritons are in their 
fourth week of pract,ice in 
anticipation of the tour, but as 
third year Coach Lyle Yates 
says, "We're working slowly

Women's 200 Free Relay Swim Team 
Our Athlete of the Week is actually a group of fine 

athletes from the Triton women's swim team. The four 
girls are Michelle Brafman. DeDe Steinhoff. Barbara Lee, 
and Tanya Jones, and they make up the Women 's 200-
meter Freestyle Relay Team. [n their first meet of t he year. 
the quad recorded a time of 1 :45.90. only about .3 of a 
second off from a national qualifying time. This is a 
phenomenal feat , especially considering it 's t heir first 
competition. Steinhoff and Lee are returnees; Brafman and 
Jones are freshmen, and the combination became the first 
UCSD women's team to defeat a D U relay team.

By JEFF AVAGE

The UCS D women 
volleyball team took the crowd 
on a roller coaster ride in 
Triton Pavillion Saturday 
night on their way to losing to 
Cal State Northridge in four 
games. The Triton ' blew out 
Northridge in the first game, 
los t the econd, played their 
most exciting volleyball of the 
home season in the third, and 
were blown out in the final 
game. All the crowd could say 
after the wild affair was 
" whew." 

Exper s port Inc., the

Before the match even 
started , you knew this wou ld 
be a special night , as the crowd 
who filled the Pavillion despite 
Halloween happenings and the 
rain gave the team a five

year 's accomplishment . In 
the first game, the Tritons 
accomplished something the 
crowd did not figure on by 

blowing orthridge away 15·3 
and playing error - free 
volleyball. Coach Doug 
Dannevik said the key wa the 
noise level in the gym. "That 
was as fine a game as UCSD 
has ever played since I've been 
here. and it was a direct result 
of the crowd. Northridge ju t 
didn't know how to cope with 
it." One encouraging ign, 
other than the result it elf. i

the blocks quicky. something 
they have had trou ble doing

The Budman sums to have 
created some controvesy (like he 
never has) with his new ratings. 
What's the controversy? Well, as only 
the Budman can In his normal 
dipsomanic state ot mind he has 
rearranged and shifted so many 1M 
teams around it's hard to tell what's 
going on. Or is it? To the astute 1M 
sports watcher, and you know who 
you ar~, it seems to make a lot of 
sense. Th~re are so many teams out 
there who want their mugs on the 1M 
Hall ot Champions wall that they 
would recruit Kar~~m Abdul Jabbar 
to plfIY 'A' league basketball, Thus we 
are getting top teams playing down a 
division, This Is normally referred to 
as 'sandbagging', To those of you 
who have lost to some ot these 
teams 'sandbagging' Is a cuss word. 

Well, anyway, the Budman has 
taken the teams who look very, very 
strong and created new divisions for 
them. Most ot the comments relayed 
to me from the 1M czars have been 
favorable,

~n-3 basketball is heading into 

the playoffs after a short but 
competitive season. 3-00-3 is a 
unique 1M sport. What other 1M sport 
are you guaranteed making the 
playoffs by just signing up a team to 
play. Everyone makes the playoffs in 
3-00-3. There is a .500 and over 
playoff and a under .500 playoff. 

'AM' shapes up as a match up of 
'Vision Cafe' and it's redwood front 
line of Howard 'the medic' Grunloh 
and Tom 'trunk' Skalag vs. 'More 
Morrison' with it's deadeye shooting 
of Greg '3 point' Wilson and Jeff 
'swish' Peters. 'Need Radar' has an 
outside chance, WfIY outside. 

In 'M ' if records are any indication 
of whose the best 'A Quick One' 
should be the odds on favorite to 
take all the marbles. But in this 
humble reporters opinion they don't 
have a shot at winning it all, I think 
they're in a weak leasue. But, I've 
been proven wrong before, I think it 
was back in 1960 when I said 
Mazeroskl COUldn't hit a home run to 
save his life, Look for the 1KE' to take 
it all. 

In 'A' as usual it 's hard to pick a 
winner. The favorite though seems to 
be the team of Dane Long, Karl 
Conroy and Kenny Kingshill, I would 
mention their team name but even 
the Budman is too smart to print their 
team name. If you want to know I'd 
ask one ot the team members.

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG Slaff W rilerR 

W.HA T'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. The poor San Diego 
ClIppers. Not only are t hey one of the worst teams in basketball 
and controlled by an inept ow~er, but they have to pu t up with 
t he a~ttc of Bill Walton . While the Clipper mu t scratch and 
claw JU t to be compet itive, the 6' 11 " redhead is not even with 
the team most of the time. Four out of every five games Walton is 
up in Northern California studying to be a lawyer. A NBA center 
trymg to become an attorney is cert ainly admirable, trymg to 
play basketball at the same time dosen' t seem wise. T he former 
UCLA grea t i a vit al cog of the team, and it 's a shame he can' t 
ron tribute mor e. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, Dick W agner , Pres ident of 
the Cincinnati Reds. Wagner , if you r emember, dismantled t he 
Big Red Machi"e of the 70 's because he was too cheap to pay his 
players what t hey were wor th. The t ight ward president r ecentl y 
stated that the club has g reat talent , superb pitching, and that 
they were good as at least half the team i n the major leagues. 
Funny, while g lancing over the fi nal tandings we cou ld have 
sworn that C incinnati had the wor st record i n basketbal l. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, A t an indoor occer stadium at 
the Sports Arena last yea r , we were left wi th a bad taste in our 
mouths. The beer they served was terrible, as was the game 
being played. Who is the indoor soccer league tr ying to kid?That 
wasn' t soccer, but a huge billarc:l table - the ball was always 
going in. Maybe US indoor soccer of fi cials hould see a game in 
practically any other country in the world w here real soccer is 
played . les too bad that t he integrit y ofthe sport is being ruined 
In t he United States - anythmg for a buck. But w hat's worse is 
that the naive American public i pending that buck. We guess 
that the old addage that " a foo l and his money are soon par ted," 
holds true in this case. Since indoor soccer star ts i ts new season 
this week, all we can say is"hip, hip hooray." 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Fights in hockey. T wo 
weeks ago, a Minnisota North St ars defenseman snuck up 
behind an opposing goalie and busted his stick over the poor 
gu y 's head . Not surprisingly, his punishment was a suspension 
of a mere eight days. These lax penalities have always been the 
case, and unless stricter rules are enforced, f ights will happen 
again ... again .. _and again ... But the pertinent question is " Does 
the average fan go to see well-played hockey or a boxing match?" 
T h e answer is frightening. 
QUOTES EXTRAORDINAIRE DEPT, A Chicago Bull 
basketball fan was asked w hat he t hought of number one draft ' 
choice Quinnt i n Dailey despite t he former USF guard' 
adm itt ing to exual assault. " Who cares? As long as he helps the

Apparently drained of 
emotion, the Triton lost 
handily 15·2 and it was over. 

UCSD's overall perfor-
mance was impressive if not 
superb, especial ly the 
individual efforts turned in by 
Debbie Doran. who had an 
outstanding evening with nine

(computed like a ba~eball

created by the st rike, "NBC portsworld" is coming to an Diego 
to cover the UCSD fencing match against the University of 
Michigan this Sunday at 2 pm EDT. Why would the Wolverines 
travel across the country to face the Tntons? We can name

from the net work, while UC 0 will be paid 5300,000.
