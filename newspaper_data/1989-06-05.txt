Muir Judicial Board 
Hears Protester Case 
By REBEKAH YOUNG 
Staff Writer 

The first hearing for a protester 
arrested at the April 21 Price Cen-
ter ribbon-cutting ceremony was 
held Thrusday evening before the 
Muir College Judicial Board. 

Jeffrey Kile, a Muir College 
student arrested at the protest, 
was accused of violating two sec-
tions of the UCSD Student Con-
duct Code. 

violations were derived from the 
police report submitted by Officer 
David Rose after Kile's arrest. In 
his report, Rose stated that Kile 
acted as a "moving screen" be-
tween himself and Arnie Shoen-
berg, a protester that Rose was 
pursuing. Rose also claimed that 
Kite "pushed and bumped" him 
several times in Kile's attempt to 
keep him away from Schoenberg. 

University Student Conduct 
Coordinator Nick Aguilar deter-
mined how Kile had violated 
University Regulations from the 
police report, Dreilinger said. 

Jeffrey Kite (left) defends himself before the Muir College Judicial Board Thursday. Officer David 
Rose (right) testifies against Klle at the hearing. 

According to a letter sent to 
Kile from Muir College Dean 
Chips Dreilinger, the specific sec-
tions of the code that Kile al-
legedly violated are the "obstruc-
tion or disruption of ... administra-
tion, disciplinary procedures or 
other University activities: Inter-
fering with UCSD police officers 
in the performance of their duty," 
and engaging in " ... conduct that 
threatens the health or safety of 
any person on University prop-
erty: C\)mmitting battery [the un-
wanted touching of another per-
son] on UCSD Police Officer 
Rose." 

At Thursday's Muir College 
Judicial Board hearing, Dreilinger 
presented the case against Kile, 
calling Rose as his first witness. 
Rose testif&ed that the ehase in 
which Kile allegedly acted as a 
"moving screen" began when he 
asked Kile and Schoenberg to 
stop using the megaphone Schoen-
berg was holding. 

U CSD Student Credit Union Scheduled 
To Open This Fall in the Student Center The Muir College Council, com-

prised of 10M uir students, served 
as the Muir Judicial Board, and 
has 10 business days to submit 
their rulings on both of the charges 
and recommend any sanctions, 
according to the UCSD Student 
Conduct Code handbook. 

"I tried to get the megaphone 
from Arnie, and Jeff Kile moved 
in between Arnie and I, and so • 
began to run after Arnie . .. and as 
I tried to pass [Kile] he kept jos-
tling me back," he said.

A formal agreement to estab-
lish a student credit union at 
UCSD was signed by A.S. Presi-
dent John Ramirez and Univer-
sity and State Employees Credit 
Union (USE) President James D. 
Kieweg, Thursday. 

The agreement had previously 
been signed by UCSD Business 
Office Manager Vance Jahnes-
Smith, representing the U nivers-
ity. 

According to Kieweg, the stu-
dent credit union, a non-profit 
savings and loan organization in 
which members are owners, will 
be operated as a subsidiary of 
USE, which currently operates a 
credit union on Gilman Drive for 
UCSD staff and faculty. 

"USE has the responsibility to 
operate the credit union, and will 
provide the A.S. and the Univer-
sity with information about the 
operating results and will con-
sider input from both sources," 
Kieweg said. 

University Students' Credit 
Union President Doug H utshing, 
a Revelle senior, said the opera-
tion will be the only student credit 
union in the nation affiliated with 
an existing credit union. 

He added that there are only 12 
other student credit unions in the 
United States. 

Kieweg said that USE em-
ployee will fill the manager and 
assistant manager positions at the 
credit union, while"the rest ofthe 
positions we hope to fiU with 

students. 
"We' I probably start with four 

or five full-time equivalent posi-
tions, for eight to 10 students to 
fill. We intend to use as much 
student invQlvement as we can," 
he said. 

Kieweg added that the credit 
union will have a non-voting stu-
dent representative on the USE 
Board of Directors. 

Hutshing said that the credit 
union, which wiJI open next fall in 
the Student Center, wiJI offer sav-
ings accounts , personal loans, 
credit cards, and automatic teller 
machine cards. 

According to Hutshing, the 
credit union will not offer educa-
tion loans, but such loans "might 
be in our future," he said. 

Hutshing said that as a credit 
union, the operation will be able 
to offer competitive interest and 
loan rates and will be able to give 
extra service to students. 

"Our staff will be more sympa-
thetic, more likely to help you .... 
We'l grant credit to responsible 
UCSD students without credit 
histories," he said. 

Kieweg noted that the credit 
union will also provide valuable 
business experience for student 
employees. 

"One of the objectives is to 
create a learning experience for 
those involved," he said. 

According to Hutshing, several 
students began working toward 
forming a student credit union 
here three years ago, as a way to 
provide financial services and 
business experience to students. 

At first, Hutshing said, the stu-

dents wished to make the credit 
union financially independent. 

But the administration had 
doubts about the stability of an 
independent operation, Hutshing 
said, and "it became obvious that

The Bodies of Two Women Were Found 
Near Santa Barabara 

SANTA BARBARA - Two 18-year old females, 
who were missing since May 26, were found dead in 
the wreckage ofa 1982 Toyota Corolla SR5 
Wednesday alternoon. 

The wreckage was spotted by search helicopters off 
of Highway 101 near Buellton. 

Tanya Christensen and Faith Dennison were 
apparently involved in a single-vehicle accident in 
which the car failed to negotiate a slight curve in the 
road and traveled approximately 130 feet through the 
air across a ravine, crashing to the ground beneath a 
bridge in the roadway.

BLOOM COUNTY r-------, 

A UCSB Student's Body Was Found 
During a Search For Two Women 

SANTA BARBARA - The body of Ian Jones, a 
UCSB fraternity member missing since November, 
was found Wedne day, May 31 by search helicopters 
looking for two 18-year old females who had been 
missing for several days. 

Jones' body was found 150 feet from the wreckage 
of his car. The search helicopter spotted the green 
Jetta in the chaparral hillside of a 300-feet sheer 
embankment. The cause of the accident remains a 
mystery, and investigators cannot conclusively 
determine whether it was an accident or a suicide, 
according to Santa Barbara Sheriffs Detective Jeff 
Meyer. The length of time that has passed since the 
accident po es a problem for investigators, because the 
markmgs on the terrain that could offer clues to the 
nature of the accident have been overgrown or 
washed away.

uel Chancellor's Residence To Be 
Built With Private Funds 

IRVINE - Private funds are being raised to 
finance construction of a $3 million on-campus 
University-owned residence for UCl's chancellor, UCI 
campus officials announced . 

As reported in the New University, UCl's student 
newspaper, the house will include rooms for official 
and social fun~tions that are currently held at the 
University Cluo and at off-campus rented facilities. 
The house will also include the chancellor's private 
residence. 

The 2.2 acre residence will overlook the campus 
and the Pacific Ocean. 

According to Roy Domaier, the assistant executive 
vice chancellor of financial planning, the University 
House will be the first such project system-wide that 
will be built with private, non-academic funds. 

Construction is scheduled to begin in fall 1989 and 
to be completed a year later. 

Two Student Groups Clash Over 
Zionist and Palestinian Rights 

DA VIS - D.¥ring a book fair .M~y 25 on ~he UC 
Davis campus, a near confrontation was aVOided as 
two groups of students clashed over Zionist and 
Palestinian rights. 

The activity, a part of Israel Awareness Wt;ek spon-
sored by the Israel Action Committee (lAC) on cam-
pus was designed "to promote a better understanding 
of what Judaism is," according to Melissa Weintrob, 
lAC chairperson.

During the event, lAC reported that members of 
the Genera Union of Palestine Students harassed an 
individual and obstructed the book fair. 

Behind the lAC book fair table, pro-Palestinian 
students held signs and pictures deploring the violence 
and bloodshed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 

While the verbal disputes did not come to physical 
blows, UC police were present because of the tension 
between the student groups which could have led to 
violence. - Emily Gest, Cali/ornia Aggie

A.S. To Hold a Letter Writing 
Workshop on Wednesday 

A.S. Council members, in response to the on-going 
Sacramento debate over Governor George Deukmeji-
an's proposed 10 percent increase in student fees, will 
hold a letter-writing workshop for students interested 
in making their views on the issue known at the state 
capitol. 

According to A.S. President John Ramirez, Deuk-
mejian is attempting to push his proposed increase 
through the state legislature despite Senate and 
Assembly members' desire for a more moderate three 
percent increase. 

At the letter-writing workshop, to be.held between 
II a.m. and 5 p.m. Wednesday, at the Price Center's 
free speech area, A.S. Council members will be on-
hand to help students draft letters which Ramirez will 
deliver to governor's assistants when he goes to 
Sacramento this Friday to lobby against Deukmeji-
an's proposed fee increase. 

More information about the workshop is available 
by calling the A.S. Council's office at 534-4450.

HEARING 
Continued from pale J 
Attorney's Office's attention Rose 
added . 

"I wasn't hurt, I wasn't injured, 
but I was interfered with, and no 
one has a right to interfcre with an 
officer when he's performing his 
duty," Rose said. 

Kile, acting as his own counsel, 
questioned Rose and attempted 
to show that Rose was confused 
about the events that took place 
April 21. Kile pointed out that in 
his report, Rose stated Officer 
Bao Luu arrested Kile when in 
actuality, Kile said, it was Police 
Chief John Anderson. 

Rose objected to Kile's line of 
ouestionin~. 

"By trying to bring in John 
Anderson or other issues into this 
you're obscuring what the actual 
proceeding was," Rose said. 

Kile responded that "it is very 
relevant if I can prove that certain 
aspects [of Rose's report] are 
indeed diametrically opposed to 
the reality of what happened here." 

The prosecution had no further 
witnesses after Rose. 

Kile began his defense by say-
ing he would attempt to prove 
through eyewitness testimony that 
"the charges brought against me 
are entirely bogus and unwar-
ranted." 

Kile then stated he would not 
testify on his own behalf but 
would base his defense on the tes-
timony of his witnesses present at 
the hearing and written deposi-
tions from other witnesses. 

Kile added that the testimony 
would recount the "aggressive" 
conduct of the police at the pro-
test. He argued that the police 

were unprepared to deal with the 
demonstration and therefore re-
acted with force and violence. 

"This is of utmost importance 
in our effort to explain what we 
believe was the rationale for the 
administrators' illegal and arbi-
trary pressing of charges against 
me," Kile said. 

Kile then called his witnesses: 
A.S. President Maynard Dimmes-
dale, Student Advocate Bard-
Alan Finlan, political science 
Professor Peter Irons, and many 
of the protesters who witnessed 
the incident. 

liThe charges brought 
against me are entirely 
bogus and unwar-
ranted. ,. 

-Jeffrey Ki Ie 

Witnesses of the protest were 
called to speak before the Council 
and l?e questioned by Kile. 

Matt Scoggins, one of these 
witnesses, was asked if Kile ran 
from some place -to which Scog-
gins replied "no." 

When further questioned by 
Kile, Scoggins said that Kile had 
not bumped his body into Rose. 

"From my perspective, you were 
trying to get out of the way. You 
were moving and you couldn't tell 
where [Rose] was going to go," 
Scoggins said. 

Witness Leslie Samuels testi-
fied to the aggressiveness of the 
police when they arrested another 
student protester. She described 
seeing the student scramble up 
the stairs by the fountain only to 
have two police officers and three 
men in suits "just fallon him."

anything like w~at they did to

Maynard Dimmesdale testified 
that he was not part of the dem-
onstration but was selling T-shirts 
near the protesters. 

The stairs by the fountain were 
packed with protesters, Dimmes-
dale said, when the police began 
to run through the crowd. 

"I thought [the protest] was def-
initely helped out if not initiated 
by some of the excitement created 
by the Police," Dimmesdale said. 

"I'm sure that people tried to 
move out [of the Police's way] 
whenever possible, which wasn't 
frequent," Dimmesdale added. 

Dimmesdale said he did not see 
the alleged incident involving Kile, 
though. He added he was not 
aware megaphones were not al-
lowed. 

Dimmesdale called the protest 
a "peaceful" demonstration. 

Professor Peter Irons, when 
questioned by Kile, agreed that 
First Amendment rights apply to 
a general peaceful assembly and 
demonstration "subject to reaso-
nable regulations of time, place 
and manner." 

Irons discussed a memo from 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Tom 
Tucker that had been attached to 
Kile's police report. 

The memo stated that due to 
the close location of Central 
Library and the Student Health 
Center, the Price Center Plaza 
and the lawn areas must be desig-
nated as "program spaces." Re-
servations must be made through 
the Price Center Reservations 
Office to use the locations. The 
memo also states that the loca-
tions will not be designated free 
speech areas. 

"The way in which Mr. Tucker, 
in fact , has framed his rather 
vague meorandum here . . . does 
not prohibit sound amplification, 
it simply says that the administra-
tion will decide who shall use it or 
when. So obviously if the Health 
Center or the Library are that 
close that sound amplification 
should not be used then it 
shouldn't be used period," he 
said. 

I n his closing statement, Drei-
linger said that if Tucker's ruling 
that the Price Center is not a free 
speech area was done improperly, 
there are ways to address that 
through the University. 

"It does not follow that if Mr. 
Tucker made an improper ruling, 
anyone may subsequently violate 
any rule they want because they 
think they're justified in doing 
so," Dreilinger said. 

Dreilinger also stated that no 
testimony that he heard supported 
the contention that Kile's alleged 
violations were a direct result or 
consequence of excessive force

applied to other students. 
Kile, in his closing statement, 

again brought up the claim that 
Rose's report was incorrect in 
stating Officer Bao Luu arrested 
him when witnesses have attested 
it was Police Chief John Ander-
son. 

"(Anderson] was in plainclothes 
and neglected to identify himself 
as a police officer ... . For an 
offense to exist the person must 
know that the other person is a 
police officer. I obviously didn't 
know the man in plain clothes 
was a police officer so the arrest 
was not a legal arrest," he said. 

Kile concluded that Anderson 
would be forced to fabricate 
charges because of the wrongful 
arrest . 

"Either Rose is serving as And-
erson's fall guy," Kile stated, "or 
he has mixed-up my involvement 
with him for that of someone who 
did obstruct or batter him." Eye-
witness testimony totally contra-
dicts Rose's report, he added.

On the Western Front 
President Bush caused a stir at the NATO summit in Brussels 

last week with his proposal to pull 30,000 troops out of Western 
Europe. This long overdue idea will strengthen the United States 
both at home and abroad. 

It is a good plan on many levels. On the broadest strategic 
level, the removal of these troops does little to weaken Western 
Europe; as many observers have pointed out , invading Europe is 
not very high on Gorbachev's "Things to Do"list. These troops 
are simply unnecessary; the nuclear deterrent is more than ade-
quate, and the wi~hdrawal of troops is contin~nt upon the 
reduction of Soviet conventional forces. The Soviets have also 
said that they have changed their troops from an "offensive 
posture" to a "defensive posture" - a claim U.S. intelligence 
supports. 

Moreover, the removal of these troops provides an excellent 
opportunity to move toward "burden-sharing," the controver-
sial idea that our allies should pay a bigger share of their own 
defense. Two of our most important allies, Japan and West 
Germany, are outperforming us economically, and most of the 
European countries are gearing up for the single European 
market in 1992, which is sure to greatly increase their wealth. It's 
becoming apparent that they can afford the cost of defense more 
than we can. Removing this huge drain on our resources will 
help reduce the budget deficit, and consequently reduce the 
trade deficit and national debt. 

Bush's proposal also helps to advance democracy throughout 
the communist world. The success of Gorbachev's reforms 
depends, to a large extent, on his ability to move the Soviet 
Union away from a cold war stance, and reallocate its resources 
away from military spending. If we want to help the Soviets in 
their steps toward freedom, negotiating the scale-down of con-
ventional forces is an effective way to do it. In addition, freedom 
in the Soviet Union means greater freedom in the Eastern Bloc 
countries, and in China, since many of China's resources are 
committed to defending itself from Soviet aggression. 

On a more human level, removal of these troops will help to 
lessen anti-American sentiment in Europe. Talk to an American 
who has been abroad ; he or she will be quick to point out that 
most foreigners r::sent the American military presence in their 
countries. The Germans feel overwhelmed by the U.S. troops, 
which have been occupying the country for more than 40 years. 
The only countries which really appreciate U.S. bases are those 
which are weak economically or unstable politically. 

But even countries which are both, such as the Philippines, 
have strong pockets of anti-American feeling. This causes their 
governments to demand high rents for the bases , which we can ill 
afford. When their economic lot improves , the resentment 
becomes strong enough to force leaders to demand the removal 
of bases, as happened in Spain. The merchants and others who 
benefit economically from the presence of U.S. troops become 
an ever weaker minority, and the majority of people become 
annoyed by the sounds of U.S. jets flying overhead. 

The presence of troops reinforces the bully stereotype of the 
United States. Also, the conduct of these young people, far from 
home, is similar to students in Tijuana - in other words, not 
very good. This doesn't do much for the U.S. image either. 

Maintaining the presence oflarge numbers of combat soldiers 
in Europe is too costly, strategically unnecessary, burdensome to 
both superpowers, and does little to win the U.S . support from 
foreign peoples. Negotiating the removal of the troops in Eun)pe 
is an excellent idea, and a step toward what President Bush calls 
a "whole and free" Europe. This bold move should be followed 
with more proposals to reduce U.S. forces elsewhere in the 
world.

Homophobia Prevalent at UCSD 
Editor: 

I am wrltmg in response to 
Julie Wartell's letter (Guardian, 
May 30) complaining about the 
recently hired softball co-coaches. 
Although Wartell assures her 
readers that she is "in no way 
denouncing homosexuali'ty," her 
lettel1 is viciously homophobic 
throughout, and symptomatic of 
the rampant heterosexism that 
still pervades this "liberal" 
campus. 

Why is it that with the high 
incidences of sexual harassment 
of women by heterosexual male 
instructors and coaches, Wartell 
focuses her venom on the lesbian 
softball coaches? Her condemna-
tion of the coaches for bringing 
"their personal relationship prob-
lems with them to practices and 
games" is a thinly veiled variation 
on the old homophobic stay-in-
the-ghetto line, "I don't care what 
they do in bed, but why do they 
have to flaunt it in pUblic?" Notice 
that this is never said of hetero-
sexuals. 

In fact, in this society (and so, 
on this campus) heterosexuals 
parade their sexuality - flaunt 
their privilege - in the faces of 
lesbians and gay men everywhere 
every day. Yet I doubt that the 
hypocritical Wartell has the inte-
grity to condemn these violations 

of the rather patriarchal perso-
nal/ public dichotomy that she 
claims to subscribe to. 

It seems that at UCSp it's now 
cool to be anti-racist and anti-
sexist, while homophobia and the 
persecution of lesbians and gay 
men is not only condoned but 
encouraged. As Angela Davis has 
repeatedly emphasized, change 
will never come from single issue 
struggles: we must recognize the 
connections between racism, sex-
ism, classism, and heterosexism, 
and support the struggles of a/l 
"minorities" against oppression. 
Unfortunately, this recognition is 
still far from realization at U CS D. 

Was it just coincidence that 
LAGO did not speak at the re~ent 
rally in support of ethnic/ gender 
studies requirements? Was it just 
forgetfulness that not one of the" 

rally speakers men ion~d homo-
phobia and the need to fight prej-
udice and violence against lesbi-
ans and gay men on this campus 
(I personally know of two recent 
lesbian/ gay-bashings at UCSD)? 
Was it mere chance that no one 
talked of educating students and 
faculty about heterosexism, and 
of hiring more openly lesbian/ -
gay faculty, as well as more women 
and people of color? 

Lesbian and gay students on 
this campus are silenced every 
day inside and outside the class-
room. In addition, their culture, 
history, and ex periences are erased 
from syllabuses and textbooks. 
Not satisfied with this, Wartell 
now wants to silence lesbian and 
gay faculty and staff members 
too. Perhaps concentration camps 
are next on her list?

The Disappearance 
of Free Expression 
at Universities 

By DAVID BURKHART 
Opinion Edi(or 

.. \.. 
Box 

It was a startling event. A reporter for the 
Knight-Ridder news service, Aaron Epstein, 
wrote that "It was like spotting Ayatollah Ruhol-
lah Khomeini at an American Legion convention 
or Julia child at a hot dog stand." Edwin Meese 
III , former attorney general, was standing next 
to Morton Halperin, the Washington director of 
the American Civil Liberties Union in the ACLU 
Washington Headquarters. What was Meese 
doing there? 

Part of the reason lies in the experience of a 
friend of mine, James Taranto. I've known James 
for about eight or nine years. Two years ago. he 
wa the news editor of the California State Uni-
versity, Northridge newspaper. the Daily Sundial. 

He wrote a column about an incident at 

-

UCLA, where a controversy erupted over a car-
toon called "U .C. Rooster" which was published 
in the UCLA Daily Bruin. The cartoon showed a 
student asking the rooster how he got into 
UCLA, and the rooster answering, "Affirmative 
action. " 

A group of students objected to the cartoon, 
and stormed into the Bruin offices and threat-
ened Ron Bell, the editor-in-chief. According 
to Bell, one student said to him, "I should do to 
you what they do to roosten;. Do you know what 
they do to roosters?~ Bell was forced by the Asso-
ciated Students Communication Board to run an 
apology and send his reporters to cultural aware-
ness workshops. 

Taranto's column in the Sundial pointed out 
that censor hip and violence should not be used 
against differing viewpoints in a university. He 
also pointed out the inconsistency of the board's

That Old Racism Problem 
Editor: 

Once again I find myself re-
sponding to someone's distorted 
view of racism. This time, I would 
like to respond to Kelli Willis' 
claim that "black magic" is a 
racist term. In my view, this is a 
most ridiculous idea. 

In her letter, Kelli Willis cites 
examples where the color black 
silllifies something bad. I can 
offer examples where black is 
good. Isn't a black tie affair better . 
than an informal affair? 

plants are green. Likewise, gold 
represents wealth because of the 
precious metal of the same name. 
I should point out that such uses 
of color are not entirely universal. 
For example, a bride in the West-
ern world wears white to repre-
sent purity. IntheOrient, red is the 
color of choice for brides. 

Also, as I pointed out above, 
black is not always evil; it all 
depends on the context . Remem-
ber, people are not colors and 
colors need not always be asso-

OPINION 
ciated with a particular race. 

In closing her letter, Kelli Willis 
states that she does not wish to 
evoke a stream of defensive re-
plies. Unfortunately, such imma-
ture thoughts must be responded 
to. 

We cannot live our lives in con-
stant fear of racism. We should 
not be trying to get away from 
terms like "black magic" as Kelli 
Willis states. What we should be 
trying to get away from are knee-
jerk responses promoted by a 
paranoia of racism. As I said in 
my last letter, lighten up. 

Jan Bacailid 
Wouldn't a stockbroker prefer 

to be in the black as often as pos-
sible? Furthermore. doesn't the 
song "That Old Black Magic" 
make black magic sound roman-
tic? Is this bad? 

Reverse Racism Redux 
Editor: 

If someone 100ks for anything 
hard enough, he will find it. Often 
it is too easy for people to fi.nd 
racism where it does not exist. Of 
course, racism is wrong and 
should not be tolerated, but ban-
ning phrases involving the word 
"black" isn't the answer. 

Offense should not be taken 
every time a color is used symbol-
ically. Colors have always been 
used as symbols and probably 
always will be. For example, green 
usually represents life because 

As a black female I'd like to 
respond to the article submitted 
by David Kritzer, a white male 
who seems to have trouble swal-

being in positions of power. He 
seems to feel that the minority

However, if this was an office full

to yet another unsubstantiated 
attack upon minorities and their 
capability to function as success-

in David's article is reminiscent of

Commentary 

Teaching Realities 
By ROBERT E. BLAKE, JR. 

A recent letter (GuardiDn, May 22) spurred 
quite a bit of discussion and sarcasm between 
myself and others in the chemistry department. 
During our conversation, it became clear that its 
author, Renee Lewis, is nearly as naive about the 
workings of a major university today as when she 
arrived here in the (aU. 

lt is true that many teaching assistants do have 
poor communication skills and/ or a substandard 
understanding of the course material. Unfortu-
nately, the solution to this problem is not simply 
a slight modification of the "teaching assistant 
selection process." Her anicle sUllests that pro-
fessors insist upon "choosing" individuals with 
high GPAs over more qualified applicants. 

What she fails to realize is that the miracle 
work force which wiU replace the existing T A 
staff is nowhere to be found. In fact, the primary 
reason that we have any T As at all is that gradu-
ate students are a relatively inexpensive and a 
pliable source of labor. They are quantitatively 
required to teach several quarters of chemistry; 
they do not apply for such duties. 

As budding professional researchers, most 

ltimate

. ........... -... 

T As are busy enough trying to learn the informa-
tion they need to do their research - which was 
not covered in any classroom. Their schedules 
typically consist of classes of their own, disserta-
tion research, seminar attendance, library re-
search and self-preparation for qualifying exam-
inations, all in addition to their teaching loads. 
All considered, this typically requires about 6S 
hours per week, with no summer vacation. 

This situation is not unattractive for individu-
als who are genuinely interested in science, but 
you can be sure that teaching undergraduates is a 
lower-priority task. Most of the chemistry stu-
dents at UCSD are non-majors who also tend to 
put chemistry classes at the bottom of their prior-
ity lists, and believe me, it shows. About 70 to 80 
percent of the students that I have taught carea 
little about learning the material. 

They simply wanted a decent grade in the class, 
not realizing the importance of chemistry in our 
daily lives. The many teaching assistants who do 
care about teaching can stand against such 
apathy only for so long. 

The reason that G PAis so important for select-
ing undergraduate teaching assistants is that in 
order to become a teacher, one must first have 
mastered the course material him/ herself. Gen-
erally, a student who has received a 'C' in a 
course is little more than clueless with respect to

Teaching 
Continued from pale 5 
the subject. 

This person, despite good com-
munication skills, would be about 
as effective as a math or science 
graduate student T A who fails to 
communicate what he j she does 
know. When confronted with a 
question about Graham 's law of 
effusion , a T A without the proper 
"head knowledge" will be more 
likely to think of Graham crackers 
than collision theory. 

The importance of an out-
standing background is evident in 
any graduate T A who is stuck 
teachi ng outside his/ her field of 
specialization. They are almost 
due to the aforementioned students 
apathy, so are most likely to 
simply muddle through. In most 
cases, the qualified ind ividua ls 
are better off tutoring concerned 

individuals on their own time for 
SIO an hour than being a teaching 
assistant for the University for $9 
an hour. 

This of course, brings me to the 
S538 a quarter we pay for regis-
tration fee and student activity 
fees. As you should be aware, thi 
money is not representative of the 
cost of an education, it is only that 
small percentage that keeps the 
bureaucratic machinery running. 
Actually, it costs over S 10,000 per 
year to educate each un iversity 
level student, not including T A 
salaries. 

If we wished to hire better 
teaching assistants, we would have 
to spend quite a bit more money 
than we are now. M ost of our 
T As would be delighted to get out 
of their teaching requirements. 

In the present situation, if a TA 
is inadequa te, our options are 
simple. Let the department know 
through student eva luations, t ry 

OPINION 
out different sections, and take 
the opportunity to practice learn-
ing something on our own for a 
change. That is how the "real 
world" operates anyway. 

It is worth noting that T As in 
the chemistry department are 
required to go through a manda-
tory teacher education program. 
The department also gives an 
awesome 5150 book and supplies 
award to the most outstanding 
T As each year. Unfortunately, 
this minimal award is of compar-
able value to the psychological 
reward of teaching uninterested 
students. Also, I must apologize 
to the unrepresented minority of 
conscientious, interested students, 
towa rd whom this is not d irected . 

Blake has been a teaching assist-
ant for seven quarters. and has 
won the chemistry department 
teaching award. 

Expression: At Risk 
Continued from pale .. 
action by running an excerpt 
from UCLA's black student news-
paper, Nommo, which made racist 
comments about whites, calling 
them "tricksters" and "possessive 
and greedy." 

Ironically, Taranto discovered 
he was right; free speech is in 
danger at universities. He was 
suspended for two weeks by his 
publisher, journalism Professor 
Cynthia Rawitch, for reprinting 
the cartoon with his column. The 
Sundial had a little-used rule 
requiring controversial material 
to be shown to the faculty pub-
lisher before publication. 

Taranto filed suit against 
Rawitch and Northridge. The suit 
was settled recently, and the North-
ridge journalism department 
has agreed to only engage In prior 
review for cases of potential libel , 

sion of viewpoints they find dis-
tasteful, and must carefully avoid 
caving in to special interest groups 
demanding censorship. But the sad 
irony is that too often, the former 
'60s radicals who fought for their 
right to free expression are now the 
same people who are engaging in 
the censorship. 

This hypocrisy has to stop if 
universities are going to be the 
marketplaces of ideas that they 
are meant to be. Rational dis-
course on controversial issues is 
what is expected at a university, 
not violence and censorship .

AIDS Center to Begin at U CSD 
By MEGAN O'KEEFE 
Staff Writer 

A panel of distingui hed medi-
cal investigators met last Thurs-
day, to announce the commence-
ment of a multi-million dollar 
AIDS research center, based at 
the UCSD School of Medicine. 

The National Institute of Men-
tal Health is funding the new H]V 
Neurobiological Research Center 
(HNRC), to be located in Hill-
crest, with approximately S19.5 
million over the next five years, 
according to a press release issued 
by Health Science Communica-
tions. 

The HNRC will be directed by 

CREDIT 
Continued from page 1 
we would have to bring in a pro-
fessional credit union [to assist 
the operation). n 

The loss of independence was a 
mixed blessing, H utshing ex-
plained, as the credit union both 
-lost autonomy and gained the 
experience and resources of an 
existing financial institution. 

Dr. Igor Grant, professor and 
chairperso n of the psychialry 
department at the UCS D School 
of Medicine and as istant chief of 
psychiatry for ambulatory care at 
the V A Medical Center. 

According to Grant, the center 
is designed to examine the neuro-
logical, psychological, psychiatric, 
struclUral and immunological 
effects of the HIV infection on the 
central nervous system. 

Grant said that a sludy like this 
has never been done before. He 
said it was previously believed 
that AIDS was a disease of the 
immune system, but noted that it 
is now understood that AI DS is a 
disease of the central nervous 

system. 
Grant's primary concern is the 

study of the neurotic and psy-
chotic behavior of H IV patients, 
as well as the rate of progression 
of the disease. and the extent to 
which AIDS is reversible. 

"Up until now, the study of 
central nervous system involve-
ment of HIV has been something 
of a patchwork with some people 
looking at neurology, others look-
ing at psychiatric phenomena. 
This is an opportunity to take a 
comrehensive look at the progres-
sion of HIV infection in the cen-
tral nervous system, and to begin 
studies on mechanisms involved 
in nervous system damage, n Grant 

The students decided to form a 
relationship with USE, and "for 
the last year we've been working 
with them to flesh out our rela-
tionship," Hutshing said. 

UCSD students and officials met to final ize plans for a student 
credit union. 

Ramirez, who signed the agree-
ment as a representative of the 
A.S., of which the credit union is 
a service, said the credit union is 
"a valua ble service .. . it's another 
way that the A.s . is trying to 

reach out to students and their 
needs."

graduate Affairs Joseph Watson 
said that he saw the credit union

UCSD Undergraduates 
Honored for Research 

By REBEKAH DENN 
Staff Writer 

A total of 115 UCSD students 
were recognized for their individ-
ual research achievements at the 
second annual UCSD Undergrad-
uate Research Conference held 
May 27 at the faculty club. 

"We're trying to give under-
graduates more recognition and 
encouragement for their scholarly 
work," said conference organizer 
Mary Freifeld, the director of 
Academic Enrichment at UCSD. 
"It's not generally known that 
undergraduates are involved in 
serious research, and that's one of 
the strengths of UCSD." 

Friefeld said another goal of 
the annual conference is to encour-
age more undergraduates to pur-
sue Ph. Ds and careers in research 
and college teaching. 

Participating students receive 
certificates of honor, and deliver 
papers on their worl<:s. The partic-
ipants were selected by their pro-
fessors, based on research done in

The research need not necessar-
ily be done at the University- one 
student spent several months in 
Hungary researching her topic, 
while another is going to Geneva 
to continue work on hers. 

The conference was organized 
into 22 roundtable discussions, 
with five or six students delivering 
papers at each table to a faculty 
moderator and a student audi-
ence. One table for example, 
combined students who had writ-
ten original plays with students 
who had analyzed plays. 

The papers covered a variety of 
subjects ranging from "Salon Soci-
ability" to "Synthesis of a Styryl 
Pyridinium Dye. n Twelve of the 
22 panels were devoted to scien-
tific topics this year, as opposed 
to only two out of 15 last year. 

"The variety of topics and level 
of work was quite astonishing," 
said Vice Chancellor of Academic

"I was really impressed by the 
quality of research." 

"This was encouraging," said 
undergraduate Elizabeth Olsen, 
who delivered her paper on his-
torical trends in creation myths. 
"It justifies that [students] have 
worthwhile things to say that other 
people want to hear." 

She added that research studies 
tend to promote education and 
original ideas more than the usual 
classroom experience does. 

Biology student Shaun Berger, 
whose project was" A Rat Model 

One paper, he said, had been 
difficult to understand. 

"It was an emperor-has-no-
clothes situation, M where not even 
the faculty admitted their confu-
sion until one of the students 
asked a very basic question. After 
that, according to Chamberlain, 
the paper was clearly explained. 

The discussions were "lively, 
intelligent, and direct ,·' agreed 
Dean of Arts and Humanities 
Stanley Chodorow. 

"I'd lost touch with what the 
undergraduates are doing, and 
this was a way of finding out. It 
was very heartening ... Jf these 
are the kinds of students who will 
end up as faculty members in JO 
years, we're in good shape."

that "There's a feeling that under-l 
graduates are neglected here .. . 'I------"""'!'"'----------------------------------------. 
but research is not the evil at 
UCSD ... only when there's re-
search instead of teaching. " 

Most faculty members, said mod-
erator Charles Chamberlain, share 
their own research in conference-
type settings. 

An undergraduate conference, 
the UCS D literature profesor said, 
"puts students in the places where 
[the professors1 peers usually are 
... It makes professors think of 
undergraduates in a different way 
. .. as potential scholars rather 
than students." 

According to Olsen, the student-
student interaction was also good. 
She said that although all the 
research was not in the same field, 
"]t's nice to meet [other] people 
who devoted as much time to 
their work and care about it. n 

Chamberlain commented that 
the work involved in focusing and 
simplifying their research for the 
presentations before the confer-
ence was a good discipline for the 
students. 

"You're going to need that 
wherever you go in life," he said, 
adding that the audience discus-
sions following the papers were 
excellent.

__ -----F __ E_~lP3~E--S-------
Public Art Inspires Viewer and Creator 

By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Contriburing Fl'arurl's Editor 

It's a sleepy Monday morning. 
The walk to c1as is dominated by 
thoughts of going back to bed . 
But this morning. something in 
the picture is different. Where 
there were trees, now there are 
trees and artwork, sculpture 
among t he commonplace surround-
ings. 

Outdoor art projects have been 
a part of Professor Peter Phillips' 
culpture classes since he began 

teaching at UC Din 1985. 
The students' work is displayed 

for one day only. 
" I like the idea of temporary 

artworks that can just kind of 
occur," Phillips explained. "We 
design them 0 that they don't 
leave any residue or any marks. 
They are intended to be tempor-
ary things that just show up one 
morning and at the end of the day 
they're gone. 

"So many of these thing are 
enjoyable and it's nice that when 
people are walking around the 
campus in their normal routine , 
where there was nothing notice-
able one day, suddenly there are all 
these interesting thing . People 
stop and look and comment and 
it generates some interest." 

According to Phillips, outdoor 
sculpture benefits the arti t as 
well as the viewer. 

"For one thing, it get [tu-
dents] away from the safety of 
doing little things in the class-
room that no one else sees, so peo-
ple rise to their best when they 
know it's going to be out on dis-
play, ~ he explained. "Also, it gives 
them a context. It takes it away 
from being strictly an exercise for 
the classroom. " 

Where the students choose to 
display their work is significant. 
Phillips hopes that his students 
seek locations that serve as a 
"natural stage" for their work. 

"I usua.lly .. . have students find 
either a site or a location where 
the work fits in, in some way, and 
relates to the site or at least find a 
situation where it's neutral for the 

work, ~ Phillips said. "It' really 
part of the departure from just 
looking at an object by itself iso-
lated from the rest of the world . 

"Part of what I try to get the 
students to do is to have the . .. 
awareness to go and eek a place 
that feel like a stage or that has a 
certain presence. They can ima-
gine how a thing might feel here 
as opposed to there. (For exam-

"It gets students 
away from the safety 
of doing little things in 
the classroom that no 
one else sees. People 
rise to their best when 
they know it's going to

pie], if you put it too close to the 
planter with the tree , then that 
may be confusing but [students] 
find a place where it kind of 
makes its own little world . There 
are natural stage ets out there 
that they find ." 

This quarter, Phillips is teach-
ing VA 1 07 A, Beginning Sculp-

ture. During the quarter, students 
do three projects, the first of 
which is exhibited in the class-
room and the last two outdoors. 

Warren College jUllior Jennifer 
Partain feels that the atmosphere 
of the class is enthusiastic, al-
though somewhat intimidating in 
the beginning. 

"At first, you're sort of over-
whelmed because [ Phillips] shows 
all these projects that everyone 
else has done and you're going, 
'Oh my God. I'm never going to 
be able to do anything that well," 
and size and so I try to get them to 
project is finished, you wouldn't 
believe how many stupendous art 
projects are done. It's really in-
credible ... 

Currently, the students are 
working on the final project which 
the entire class undertakes as a 
group. 

"One of the things I like to do in 
beginning sculpture is to get peo-
ple working in large and lively 
and very physical ways right away 
to get away from the kind of 
small, quiet, safe, little crafts sort 
of approach," Phillips said. He 
hope that students "have more of 
a sense of a sculptural presence 
and size and so I try to get them to 
do relatively quick, larger, bolder

Cold Fusion Discoveries Give Rise To 
Questions of M orals, Media and Money 

By LARA WRIGHT 
Guardian In/ern 

The UCSD Program in Science 
Studies presented a panel of 
scientists , industrialists and ana-
lysts studying the process of mak-
ing big science discoveries in cold 
fusion . The purpose of the con-
ference held at UCSD May 22 
was to talk about the process of 
discovery, announcement and 
patent of work on cold fusion. 

Popular media such as News-
week and The Wall Street Jour-

By Leigh Rubin 

nal, has not traditionally been the 
place for scientific announce-
ments. 

The announcement in the 
March 24 Wall Street Journal 
Article stated that University of 
Utah scientists B. Stanley Pons 
and Martin Fleishmann claimed 
a "Breakthrough in Quest for 
Fusion Energy." The scientists 

Thill. the flm of a two-plrt report 
on a pinel dlacuulon of cold fusion. 
Part two will appear May 9, 

announced they had created cold 
fusion with a fusion rod of pal-
ladium wrapped by a spiral of 
thin platinum wire. This is inserted 
into a test tube of water rich in 
deuterium. Trapped within th~ 
lattice-like network of palladium 
crystals, the deuterium nuclei are 
brought close enough together to 
overcome their mutual repulsion 
and fuse. As a result of this pro-
cess, helium 3 is produced, 
which is a product of the fusion of 
two deuterium nuclei. 

With these simple chemistry 
lab constructs, after 100 hours of 
reaction time, the scientists con-
cluded that fusion was taking 
place. In addition to the heat they 
detected , the scientists also ob-
served the production of neutrons, 
tritium and helium, the expected 
byproducts of fusion reactions. 

The most common source of 
deuterium-rich water is sea water. 
The implications of cold fusion 
with low radioactivity yields have 
great commercial potential, and 
the implications of such an 
abundant and cheap energy source 
as sea water are staggering. 

Applied Mechanics and Engi-
neering Sciences Profesor Jan 
Talbot, an electrochemist, des-
('ribed her first exposure to the 
scientists' announcement, "A few 
of my colleagues and I walked 
over to read about cold fusion in 

the Wall Street Journal at the 
faculty lounge ... Pretty soon I 
was getting a lot of calls from my 
friends in the field, and making a 
few calls of my own." 

A Race to RepUcate 
The Experiment 
Talbot described some reactions 

to the Utah scientists' discovery, 
"By this time, my colleagues and I 
were trying to brainstorm the cor-
rect replication of the Pons and 
Fleischmann experiment." 

Talbot is not currently replica-
ting the experiment but may 
pursue some related studies over 
the summer. Duplicating the 
experiment is not as easy as it may 
sound. Scientists must know how 
to record the results very accu-
rately in order to measure the crit-
ical changes in energy yields. 

The Wall Street Journal re-
ported few of the actual details of 
the experiment which could be 
used to replicate the results. 
"About this time articles in the 
Los Angeles Times and News-
week came out. What stands out 
to me is that it is very unusual to 
get the latest science news in the 
popular media," Talbot said. 

Alan Hyatt of General Atom-
ics dropped hot fusion and began 
cold fusion experiments as soon 
as he heard the news. He heard 
the announcement on the radio 
and read of the discovery in the 
Wall Street Journal. Hyatt con-
ferred with his colleagues and 
checked the reputations of Pons 
and Fleischmann. When he found 
them to be very reputa ble, he said 
he took the discovery "very 
seriously." 

The Wall Street Journal article 
reported the skepticism of the 
scientific community about cold 
fusion. Although the SCientists are 
highly regarded, their results were 
not accepted by some ofthe other 
scientific institutions working on 
fusion. 

A source at the University of 
Ro.chester's Laser Energetics Lab 
reported, "I haven't seen a result 
that could lead to a practical 
fusion reactor," an MIT source 
said, "the claim of cold fusion 
would sound very suspicious to 
me." 

Until recently, physicists have 
experimented with recreating the 
hot temperatures and pressures 
which are in the interior of the 
sun. This, they hoped, would 
replicate the process of fusion. 
Fusion occurs when two hydro-
gen nuclei ram into each other 
with enough force to fuse together 
to create helium. This gives off 
enough energy to maintain a sus-
tained fusion and extra energy 
which radiates throughout the 
universe. 

There are a few popular 
methods of creating hot fusion, 
however, no experiment to date 
has created a single sustained 
fusion reaction. One sustained 
fusion project, the Compact Igni-
tion Tokamak, has been proposed 
at a cost of $445 million and uses 
a magnetic bOUle to contain super 
heated particles which may fuse . 

Another technique uses lasers 
to ignite deuterium at high 
temperatures and compress it to 
get the densitities needed for 
fusion . Sources at the U of R said 
the results have been encourag-
ing, and "In the last couple of 
years the field has mushroomed." 
The experiemnt may lead to a 
continuous fusion reaction in three 
to four years. 

Peer Review 
Allegations that the Pons and 

Fleischmann results are a fraud 
were discussed by the panelists. 
Such allegations may have sur-
faced because their experiment 
has not yet been subjected to the 
peer review process. 

"Why are we seeing a relation-

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 

Big, BolrJ Outdoor Artwork 
Continued from page 10 
things. " 

Last spring Phillips' students 
created "an actual moving, work-
ing carou el made out of wood 
and covered with cardboard." 

"What happens in these [group 
projects] once students get onto 
an idea, a big idea . . . there's some-
thing challenging ... bold and 
sort of pace-setting, something 
ignites and a certain spirit goes. 
[An idea] catclJes fire at some 
point and nothing can stop [the 
students], .. Phillips said. 

"To my joy and semi-amaze-
ment, the [carousel] worked in all 
dimensions. It was amazing. The 
value I see there is that the stu-
dents get a taste of what it's like to 
be part of an artwork that is put 
out in the public. They get to take 
the bows or take the blame or 
whatever comes along but they 
get a taste of what it's like to do a 
real artwork. 

Visual Arts Professor Peler Phillips encourages his students to seek 
locations which serve as a "natural stage" for their work. 

"Generally, they are pretty suc-
cessful. .. That generates enthusi-
asm and often makes them want 
to do more having had that. 
There's also this feeling of giving 
and sharing, and I think that's 
what it's about anyway," Phillips 
continued. 

Partain feels that Phillips fos-
ters in students a sense of confi-
dence as well as enthusiasm to-
ward . their work. 

According to Wynn, Phillips 
emphasizes the form of the sculp-
ture above all else. 

"He has these real strong no-
tions of form .... You're making 
something, and he's really really 
intent on the form of it and how 
you're making it and why you're 
making it. It's not that he's con-
cerned so much about realism per 
se ... but he's really concerned 
about the form you're making." 

I n terms of the overall benefits 
ofthe class, Partain feels that her 

perception of her artistic abilities 
has been changed. 

During the quarter, the class 
was shown slides of sculpture by 
more advanced artists . Referring 
to the slides, Partain noted that 
"now I have a more realistic sense 
that maybe I can do something 
like that. It's not that far out of 
my reach. I think that's the way 
everybody feel s now because 
you're just so excited. You can't 
believe that you're doing this 
stuff. " 

Phillips "is the key because he 
makes everybody look at every-
body else's projects in such a way 
that you have to feel good about 
what you've done," she said, re-
ferring to the individual projects. 
Enthusiasm "keeps building up 
project after project. [Phillips] is 
so overwhelmed by what we've 
done . .. it excites us just to keep 
doing better and better."

The GUARDIAN wants to recruit 

YOU for next year's staff! 

Speaking generally about the 
class, Third College junior Susan 
Wynn remarked, "it's fun, you get 
to know' people, and it's Just so 
different from most of the classes 
at UCSD. It's hands-on. You 
really are building. You display it 
and people see it." Wynn also 
feels that the course is well-bal-
anced in terms of its structure.

Phillips "doesn't have the class 
so structured that you can't do 
what you want," she said. "There's 
enough guidance that you're not 
totally lost but there's not so 
much that you rebel and don't 
want to do it. On the whole, I 
really enjoy it."

Cold Fusion Discoveries eliminates what it is not, by the nature of the reactants and the products. There are many chemi-
cal and physical reactions which 
may describe the results obtained 
by Fleischmann and Pons. At this 
point more people must replicate 
the results so that we can decide if 
it is cold fusion or not." 

Continued from pale 10 
ship between reputation of the 
scientists and plausibility of cold 
fusion?" queried history/ science 
studies profesor Martin Rudwick, 
who moderated the UCSD dis· 
cussion. 

Hyatt responded, "The more 
outlandish the claim, the more 
necessary it is to check the reputa-
tion of the scientific institution 
and the scientists involved. What 
we had in this case was a two 
miracle process; first their was the 
miracle of heat release and the by-
products of fusion, and second 
there was the miracle that no 
radiation was released." 

"Didn't someone say that Pons 
and Aeischmann had a reputa-
tion for outlandish ideas which 
were occasionally right? That they 
are not usually wrong in what 
they publish. They are innovative 
and of a very solid scientific back-
ground," added philosophy / sci-
ences studies professor Philip 
Kitcher. 

Hyatt agreed and continued, 
"When I found this out, I began 
to replicate the experiment des-
cribed in the Wall Street Journal. 
Because of the nature of the 
experiment, and potential release 
of radioactivity, General Atomics 
safety division requried the use of 
a critical building, and remote 
monitering equipment. Their 
experiments reportedly took 100 
hours for the process to begin, so 
it is quite a time consuming 
process. 

"Due to the less technical nature 
of the publication of the experi-
ment, there were no technical 
papers explaining how they had 
loaded deuterium into a palla-
dium lattice. The results of the 
initial experiments were dis-
couraging, but we are still run-
ning experiments." 

Results 
As of the May I conference 

of the American Physical Society 
in Baltimore, the only confirma-
tion of results has been presented 
by Dr. Steven Earl Jones at 
Brigham Young University. He 
reported substantially less record-
ed heat and radiation levels ten 
thousand times those reported by 
Fleischmann and Pons. 

Dean of Engineering Lee Rudec 
said he was at IBM in Yorktown

The Southwestern Complny 

at the research facility for high 
temperature supercond ucting 
when the cold fusion announce-
ment was made. It was very excit-
ing. he said, pointing out that 
there is an element of skill needed 
to transact the experiment. For 
example, scientists have to know 
how to prepare the palladium. 

Other confirmations of John-
son and Mathee have not been 
able to confirm why one element 
sample reacted and the other did 
not. Like some famous experi-
ments, the Utah scientists· results 
may have been influenced by some 
catalyst which was not intended in 
the experiment. "Organized skep-
ticism will drive the scientific dis-
ciplines to replicate the experi-
ment," Rudee said. 

One member of the audience 
asked, "Do you mean to tell me 
that billions of dollars and 
enourmous time has been spent 
and scientists cannot connect the 
results ofthis experiment to what 
it might be?" 

Talbot responded, "The publi-
cation in the Wall Street Journal 

Hyatt added, "we cannot give 
one physical law that wbuld be 
broken by this experiment." Fail-
ing to spend the funds to further ' 
develp this discovery "would be 
backward," Hyatt said , because 
the market potential of a discov-
ery like this is phenomenal. 

Talbot agreed that there is no 
reason based on science to be 
skeptical of their discovery. He 
pointed and that if it is not fusion, 
and "you get this much heat given 
off without radiation, it is still an 
important scientific discovery." 

Chemistry Professor Johann 
Oesterreicher said that his studies cur-

rent�y plan experiments with 
future experiments and the com-
plimentary needs for the uses of 
cold fusion in mind. However, 
most of the funds available are 
going to replicate the cold fusion 
experiments.

Rough Finish for Men's Golf 
Six Triton teams competed on 

the Division III level this spring 
- and all six participated in 
national competition. The men's 
golf team assured that it would 
head to Nationals with a strong 
performance at the Point Loma 
Nazarene Invitational in late 
April. 

The young Tritons, however, 
suffered through a roller coaster 
National Tournament. After a 
strong first day in which they fin-
ished sixth, the Tritons fell to 11th 
place on the second day. They 
rebounded on day three to move 
up to the eighth spot, but the final 
day was a nightmare for the Trit-
ons. In heavy winds, the Tritons 
shot a 343 todrop them eight pla-
ces to finish J 6th. 

'The Tritons' day-by-day per-

formanee mirrored tbat of its top 
player, Devin Thomas. Thomas 
opened the tourney with a score 
of 73, one stroke behind the lead-
ers. He slowed down a bit on day 
two, shooting a 78 and failing 
eight strokes off the lead. 

Thomas then proceeded to set 
the tournament record with a 
score of 70 on day tbree. How-
ever, he suffered an unfortunate 
final day when he shot a 93. 

Thomas finished tbe tourney 
tied for the team lead with. score 
of 314. His score was matched by 
Gary Bong, whose four-day scores 
were 77, 78, 84 and 8~. 

During the regular season, 
Thomas led ail Triton golfers 
with a 7~.~ average. Bong was 
third with a '78. 

w. Water Polo Second in Nationals 
The Tritons' women's soceer 

team had a great season - the 
best in its history - as it domi-
nated opponents all season and 
did not lose a single match until 
the one that counted the most: the 
championship game. UCSD 
women's water polo team suffered 
a similar fate in this season of 
bests for Triton sports - it did 
not lose a single game after the 
first tournament of the season ... un-
til the final and most important 
contest. 

In the National Tournament at 
Santa Barbara, the Tritons made 
it to the final game - as expected 
- but feU victim to a UC Santa 
Barbara team that would not quit. 
Though the Tritons led 4-1 in the 
early stages of the contest, the 

Gauchos battled back and even-
tually overtook the Tritons for a 
9-8 victory and the National Title. 

Still, it waS a great year for the 
women's water polo team, a squad 
which had defeated UCSB 7-4 in 
the final ofthis year's UCSD invi-
tational, watched as the Gauchos 
forfeited a scheduled match at the 
UC Berkeley Tournament, and 
tied them in an early-season con-
test at the U C Davis Tournament. 
The 1989 Tritons' national rank-
ing of second is the highest ever 
for a UCSD women's water polo 
team. 

The Tritons destroyed Pomona-
Pitzer 26-2 in their home opener, 
swept through five teams to win

Men's Tennis 
Finimes Sixth 

What would you think if 
you heard that a team lost its 
star player, barely won half 
its pmes and then won only 
one of its three playoff games? 
Just another mediocre year? 
Not for UCSD's men's tennis 
team. 

HunterGal1away, the 10th-
ranked player in the nation 
and the Tritons' most talented 
player, was dismissed from 
the squad early in the season. 

Despite the loss, tbe Trit-
ons still went J 50 I 2 against a 
schedule filled with Division 
I opponents. They lost only 
one match to a Division III 
opponent durinl the regular 
season - falling victim to 
top-ranked UC Santa Cruz 
- and entered the National 
Tournament as the sixth seed. 
They were seeded perfectly. 

They lost two oftheir three 
tournament matches and fin-
ished sixth in the nation. 

Number one singles player 
Sig Huber finished the sea-
son ranked 23rd in the nation, 
while No. 2 Francois Mon-
nar finished 31st. 

The Triton single~ playen 
were good, but their doubles 
teams proved to be its back-
bone. 

Huber and rookie sensa-
tion Chris Belloli teamed to 
form the fifth-best doubles 
team in the nation. And the 
No.2 team of Monnar and 
Jeff French went undefeated 
through the regular season 
Division III schedule.

SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 
Crew Teams Finish With Mixed Results 

Banner Year for Women: Men Run Aground 
Women's Crew 

Before racing season began, 
Jack Vallarga, the women's crew 
coach, was hes itant to predict the 
outcome of the impending sea-
son, This reluctance was under-
standable, considering the loss of 
rowers from the program and the 
injuries plaguing the current team. 
However, his caution was unne-
cessary as the Triton women's 
crew team experienced one of 
its best seasons yet. 

Although UCSU's novice boats 
opened the season by sweeping 
their opponent, Cal Poly, open-
ing day was not quite a success. 
Both varsity boats failed to exe-
cute during their races and lost, 
seuing what appeared to be a dis-

Women's Varsity Eights capped off a successful season by capturing 
the Western Intercollegiate Rowing AssoCia,tion Championships. 

appointing precedent. 
The varsity snapped back, 

however, with a tremendous 
showing at the San Diego Crew 
Classic. Varsity heavyweights 
dominated their heat, propelling 
UCSD into the prestigious Cal 
Cup final. 

The Tritons followed this up 
with a dominating performance 
at the San Diego City Champion-
ships at which UCSD won four 
out of five races. UCSD's top 
achievemerrt at this event was the 
varsity victory, giving the women's 
team a silver cup and a reputation 
as the fastest crew in San Diego. 

UCSD continued its victory 
tour at the Oxnard All-American 
Regatta as the lightweight varsity 
captured first place and the team 
as a whole earned the "Most 
Pointsft trophy. 

The final meet of the season 
was no letdown for UCSD, as the 
varsity heavyweights finished fifth 
in tbe Grand Final at 7: 13, the 

fastest time in Triton history. 
UCSD's lightweight eight had its 
own success, finishing fourth in 
the Grand Final while the novice 
eight took sixth in the Grand 
Final. 
Men's Crew 

"Fly and die" is an old towing 
term describing a crew that bolts 
off the starting line and charges 
ahead, only to lose steam later 
down the course. This term accu-
rately describes the UCSD men's 
crew season. 

The Tritons soared down the 
bay in the season opener as the 
men's team swept past Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo. They were 
unstoppable as the three .novice 
crews and the two varsity boats 
all put marks in the win column. 

There was still air in the sails 
the following week as the Tritons 
won two novice races against 

Sa~ta Barbara. The varsity light-
weIght boat bravely battled its 
opposition, the defending Pacific 
Coast champions, but fell short. 
The varsity heavyweight shell was 
forced to scratch due to an injury. 

At the Crew Classic, however, 

the Tritons started running out of 
steam. Varsity lightweights and 
novice rowers all fell short of 
their expectations, finishing fIfth 
and thir~ respectively. The varsity 
heavyweights finished a dismal 
fifth in the Cal Cup final, but 
regrouped and demolished the 
competition in the Cal-Visitor 
Petite Final. 

The season gOt worse as the 
men's team lost three out of four 
to Loyola and repeated this per-
formance t~e following week at 
th~ San ?I~go ~jty Champion-
ships. InJUrIes, Ineligible rowers 
and a lack of veteran rowers were 
fact0!8 in Tritons' (Jownhill pro-
gressIOn, 

Pacific: Coast Championships 
offered httle reprieve as UCSD 
continued to struagle in its final 
meet. Both novice boats reached 
the Grand Finals With the heavy-
weights placing fifth and the 
lightweight taking sixth but 
neither varsity boat had the' same 
success. Varsity hCllvyweights aDd 
Lightweights finished fifth aDd 
third in their rcspective Petite 
Finals. 

Men's Volleyball Takes Conference 
The Triton seaso n can be ' 

summed up in two words : strug-
gle and domination. 

The first half of the Triton sea-
son was, as usual, a struggle. Play-
·ing against lop-ranked Division 1 
foes , the Tritons struggled to a 
5-14 stan. 

Dcspite their early season prob-
lems, things slowly began to fall 
into place for the Tritons. The 
team settled on one setter, John 
Childers, who directed the Trit-

ons to seven wins in their last nine 
games and a 12-16 record. 

The Tritons dominated second 
half opponents and went unde-
feated through both the regular 
season and the tournament of the 
Dacific Coast Volleyball Con-
.erence, 

Jeff Babcock, who finished 
third in the nation in digs and 
Nick Rothman, who was fifth led 
what was probably the fi~est 
backcourt defense in Triton his-

tory, and easily one of the finest in 
the Dation this year. 

Digger Graybill Was pickcd as 
the Conference's "Coach of the 
Year," and three Tritons - Bab-
cock, John Lim, and rookie sen-
sation Nate Brown - were named 
to the All-Conference team.

Great Year for 
Track and Field; 
Four All-Americans 

For orne Triton sport - uch as 
swimming - nothing really matters until 
the ational Meet. Then, at Nationals, 
the fate - or ucce - of the team is 
determined. Thi is also the ca e for track 
and field . Once a certain individual quaJi-
fie for ational during a regular sea-
on meet by exceeding a standard 

time for a run, throwing a certain di -
tance, etc., the rest of the regular season is 
vitually pent training for the ational 
meet . . 

This worked for the Tritons. At 
nationals, they put it all together. 

Thi year 's women' track and field 
quad had the'best performance ever for 

UCSD at the National Meet, garnering 
31 point and capturing fourth place 
overall. And all thi for a chool that does 
not even have a track that meet CAA 
tandard . 

Sophomore Shannon Quigley paced 
the women' team, a her top throw of 
45' 2 1/ 4" and 146' 8" in the shotput and 
d i cus, respectively, made her the fir t 
woman in UCSD history to win an indi-
vidual t itle in track a nd field - let alone 
two. 

Andrea Kouremeti al 0 tarred for 
the Tritons, as she ran faster and faster 
t imes during the year and finally wound 
up with the nation' fourth best t ime in 
the 200 meters (24.73) and the nation's 
seventh be t time 10 the 100 meters 
(12.90). Kouremeti wa one of four 
T riton to attain All-American statu at 
Nationals. A ide from Quigley and Kou-
remetis, Scott Sargent and Rachel Beer-
man finished in the top eight in their 
events to become All-American .

Women's Tennis Wins 
Third Title; Behrens-
Calhoun Take Doubles 

One thing is for sure: it certainly wasn't 
easy. But either way you look at it, it goes 
down in the book exactly the same way: 
three straight victories in the National 
Tournament and the Triton women's 
tennis team's third National Title since its 
beginning the early '80s. 

And the titles did not end there. After 
the team tournament's conclusion, the 
Tritons' top doubles team of Christine 
Behrens and Nancy Calhoun took the 
court and defeated Kenyon's team of 
Julie Kipka and Kathryn Lane 6-3, 6-4 to 
win the doubles tournament. It was the 
second time the Tritons have won the 
doubles tournament. 

By capturing the title, the women's 
tennis team gave 1988-89 Triton sports 
its third National Title (in addition to 
women's volleyball and men's soccer in 
the fall), helping to solidify this year in 
UCSD athletics as the best ever. 

In the team tournament, the Tritons 
dominated the University of the South 
(8-1) and held off Gustavus-Adolphus (5-
4) before obliterating Kenyon College 8-
I in the finals. UCSD was fortunate to 
face Kenyon, because Pomona-Pitzer, 
which Kenyon beat to reach the finals, 
defeated UCSD in both meetings this 
year. Incidentally, the Tritons' only Div-
ision III losses this year came at the 
hands of Pomona-Pitzer. UCSD wound 
up with a 18-5 overall record. 

In addition to Behrens and Calhoun, 
the Tritons' 1989 National Champion 
team consisted of Julie Berman, Kristin 
Diels, Susan Carney, and Jennifer Kol-
sky, all of whom were instrumental in 
obtaining the title. 

Sargent, the Triton's top hammer-
thrower, cored the only points for the 
men's team at ationals when he threw a 

u TRACK, page 15 

All-Conference player Jeff Babcock's consistently strong performances helped the 
Tritons swing into gear in the second half of the season. See story on page 18. 

Last year, the Tritons had to settle for 
a third-place finish when Kenyon de-
feated them in the semifinals. This year, it 
was a different story.

World Series Will Wait 
A nother Year for ,Softball 

Tritons Finish Season 34-7 
Will the Tritons ever make it 

out of Regionals ? 
For the second straight year, 

UCSD entered the tourney with 
high credentials, and for the 
second straight year, they re-
turned to California disap-
pointed. This year, Calvin Col-
lege delivered the knockout 
punch to the favored Tritons. 

This is not to say, however, 
that the Tritons pad a dbap-
pointing year, not by any 
stretch of the imagination. 
UCSD finished with a best-
ever 34-7 record and number 
two ranking in the country at 
the end of the regular season. 

The Tritons' pitching staff 
boasted two outstanding pitch-
ers: Dianna Moreno and Stacie 
Sasaki. Moreno was 12-3 with 
an 0.25 ERA to lead the team. 
Sasaki was 9-1 with an 0.66 
ERA. 

Not only did they have qual-
ity, but they had quantity as 

well. There was little drop-off 
after the first two pitchers. 
Kathy Fogg and Lynn Moreno 
provided strong support all 
season long. 

UCSD's pitching was out-
standing, and so was their hit-
ting. Six Tritons finished with 
a batting average of ,300 or 
better. Shortstop Dana Chai-
ken led the team with a .376 
batting average, and catcher 
Tracey Kehr hit .303 while 
driving in 16 runs. 

The Tritons were, in a word, 
awesome. They won 13 traight 
games to close out the regular 
eason, including a double-

header sweep of Division I 
University of San Diego. 

Entering Regionals , the Tri-
tons looked unbeatable. Yet 
omehow they lost two tough 

games to Calvin College and 
must wait until next spring to 
make another attempt to reach 
the College World Series.

Stanislaus Ends UCSD's World Series Bid 

Baseball Makes it to West Regional 
This year for the baseball team 

was not a headline-grabbing, 
thrilling year with all sorts of 
broken records and national 
achievements. But then again, 
with the loss of their two best 
starting pitchers - Rick Nowak 
(now in the Toronto Blue Jays~ 
organization), and Kyle Abbott 
(a lefthander who transferred to 
Long Beach and suddenly gained 
national recognition and All-
American status on the Division I 
level) - nobody expected it to be. 

Still, the Tritons came away 
with a slightly better year than 
last (when they were denied a 
postseason berth), as they finished 
23-19, ranked eighth in Division 
III , and were selected to the two-
team West Regional at Cal State 
Stanislaus. The fun stopped there. 

In their best-of-five Regional 
with Stanislaus, the Tritons -
who had revenge on their minds 
after Stanislaus nipped them in 
an earlier regular-season contest 
- suffered a three-game sweep at 
the hands of their northern foe 
3-1 , 4-0, and 13-7. 

Despite the los of Nowak and 
Abbott, the Triton pitching taff 
- which was completely different 

trom last year - pulled together 
to make up the most impressive 
aspect of this ballclub. Rick R'JP-
key, ajunior transfer from ajun-
ior college in Arizona, led the 
team in II pitching categories 
including a 1.65 ERA, a 10-4 
record, and 109.3 innings pitched. 

, His 10 wins tied a school record. 
Junior J.J. Fisher - who said 

he'd still rather hit and play in the 
outfield as he did last year -
wound up with a 7-2 record and 
put up impressive numbers in the 
strikeout department, inlcuding 
14 in one game against Phila-
delphia Textiles. Mike Morgan 
(4-8) had an up-and-down year, 
but came through with some big
