Editorial 

Peripheral Canal is a 
legislative dinosaur 

By THOMA URBACH 
Science Editor 

Having perused ome of the literature on 
Proposition 9, aka SB 200, it is clear that the is ue ha 
many faces . It encompasses all the traditional north-
outh, agribusiness'public interest and government-

bu ine affiliation, But it also breaks many 
traditional allegiance, pitting farmer against farmer 
and San Francisco-based unions again t an 
Franci co-based environmental groups. 

Propaganda a, ide, a few things seem clear. First, 
the people of Southern California are not about to go 
thirsty, though Southern Californian farmer may 
indeed run short of inexpen ive water in drought 
year. Given the increased growth of Southern 
California, there is no doubt that more water will be 
required in the future. However, Propo ition 9 does 
not seem to be the be. t way to provide that water. 
Several alternatives have been offered from diff rent 
quarter . One proposal is to use existing natural 
channels in the acramento Delta, Others have 
uggested enlarging existing facilitie, These 

proposals may have short term benefits but what we 
are really facing in this issue is the fact that there is 
not enough water in California to make everyone 
happy_ 

This problem i exacerbated by the fact that 
agriculture uses 85 percent of the state's water. 
Although Or.1e employ conservation mea ure ,many . 
do not and much water is lost through practice 
established in time of plenty. 

We are faced at every turn by the fact that 
resources are limited. It is time to begin thinking in 
term of conservation and renewable energy_ 

As a solution to the projected water hortages, 
Propo ition 9 is a dino auf. Peripheral canal 
legi lation has been batted around for 16 years and 
time have changed, Energy costs which used to 
account for ten percent of the price of water will soon 
account for 40 percent. Proposition 9 would have been 
dubious legi lation 20 years ago. Today, it is 
unacceptable, Water needs are a genuine concern but 
Proposition 9 i only a symptomatic treatment. And 
without a cure, we are in danger of losing the patient.

University for Native American 
activism on Reagan's hit list 

By RASA G STAITIS 
P£tcifk Ne", Service 

WINTERS, CAUF. - A 
one·of-a-kind Native American 
col lege, which blends 
academic traIning with 
American Indian cultural and 
spIritual value~, is bracing 
against what it believes IS a 
determined effort by the 
federal government to shut it 
down. 

The campus of D-Q 
Universitv in this northern 
California community is a 
collection of several former 
military buildings surrounded 
by flat farmlands. While it IS 
unimpressive to the casual 
observer. it has become a ke} 
cultural institution for many 
young Native Americans in its 
II years of operation. 

Because D-Q has attracted a 
number of activist s tudents it 
also has become a major 
support center for Indian 
protests in the West. including 
the occupation encampments 
in the Black Hills of outh 
Dakota and on Big Mountain 
In the Hopi -Navajo area . Both 
those prote. ts are aimed at 
federal Indian policies. 

Now, officials at D-Q believe 
the federal government is 
ftghting back by attacking the 
school itself. 

Though the college is 
private. its funds come largely 
from student aid grants 
administered by the Depart· 
ment of Education . The 

school's 643 acres and the 
buildings, formerly a surplu, 
Army radio base, arc on a 30· 
vear lease (from the General 
Services Administration), also 
administered by the DOE. At 
the end of the least period the 
land is to be deeded to the 
u ni\"crsit v. 

Ever ~ince the lea"e was 
granted in 1970, the schml has 
been under close government 
scrutiny. There have been 22 
separate investigations and 
audit by various state and 
federal agencies ince 1976, 
including a 2 1-2-year inquiry 
by the FBI. D-Q weathered 
them all, and maintained its 
accreditat ion . 

But in March, in a still 
incomplete report of an audit 
t hat was leaked to key 
congre smen and the pre s, a 
DOE leam recommended that 
the chool's lease be cancelled. 

The chool i preparing to 
contest the move to clo e it in 
court, with the Washington· 
ba ed Native American Rights. 
Fund a · counsel, said D-Q 
president Steve Baldy. 

Already, the premature 
release of the draft audit ha~ 
dashedtheschooJ'shope fora 
more secure future. U Rep. 
Vic Fazio, D-Calif., ha s 
withdrawn a bill, co-sponsored 
by 12 other congressmen, that 
would have allowed the 
university to gain title to the 
land earlier than initially 
provided. 

The draft audIt is "a shoddy 
piece of work," said Fazio's 
aide, Pat Fulton. "but it 
t h ro\\'s enough mud so t hat it 
can kill the bill." 

A Department of Educat Ion 
spokesman said it was not 
pol icy to release draft reports 
and that he had no idea how it 
got out. 

Among the allegations in the 
draft. the most serious is that 
the school had inflated 
enrollment figures to meet a 
lease condition that there be 
200 full·or part-time students 
enrolled. Baldy has challenged 
the investigators' method of 
calculation. 

The univer -ity had not seer. 
the draft and did not have" 
chance to respond to any 
errors before it was made 
public. It has since issued a 50-
page rebuttal. 

This is an old story with D· 
Q, according to ooth Baldy and 
Fulton. Last eptember, a 
purported Department of 
Education inter·office memo 
came to light in press reports 
alleging that u a criminal 
inquiry/ investigation was on-
going" at the school. Fazio 
stated that he had found no 
t race of such an inquiry. 

The following month, 
another leaked DOE inter-
office memo accused D-Q of 
" fo steri ng violence and 
savagery ," according to Baldy.

Roommates: hoots, hollers, and NO fingerprints 
By Gt:NAR VIKA 

As a child I was amused 
most by The Odd Couple, TV's 
mismatched duet. I wa never 
quite su re, though, which of 
t he characters I \~ould 
emulate in my later year~. 
Would r be Itke Oscar, t h ' 
terminal slob , or was I 
destined to become the 
embodiment of Felix, the 
human jax tornado? 

Now I reahze that I am a 
complex Integration of them 
both. Had r never lived with 
housemat es who. e own habIts 
were as antipodal from my 
own as were Os ar's from 
Felix's, I would never have 
found this out. 

Thi~ year started ~llh a 
bang, a -hoot, a holler, and a 
m essage from my f renet ic 
hou-.emate, LeslIe Llp~chllZ 
The message was thl" : "Your 
re"ponsibtlltJes \\ ill I)e as 
follo\\''': 1) Empty tra ... h, 2) 
Vacuum carpet, 3) through 28) 
Leave ;\10 fl ngerprtnts . 
Failure to comply WIll be 
regarded as grounds for 

VICt ion " 
My response was tYPIcal. I 

expressed an obVIOUS concern 
for my housemate \ mental 
health. His totle! trainrng 
must have been a \fry 
emot lOnal experience. So as 
not to voke the wrat h of as 
Impet uous and met Icul()u~ an 

mdividual as Leslie. r complied 
With his rcquest~ . But 
ll1stinctively [ set out to 
dIsturb hIm in as suht le a 
fashion as possihle. 

Tony Randall would have 
shot me; but I had no respect 
for Leslie's cleanliness 
fIxation. I had to be an Oscar. [ 
became an example of human 
entropy, I left my dishes out. I 
left grocery hags on the 
counter. I left my books all 
over the hou se. But worst of 
all, [ left fingerprints . r left 
them on purpose. How did 
Leshe react? ! Ie called his 
mommy every day. Or she 
cai ll-d hIm. And the two of 
t hem commiserated. 

Finally , no, mercifully, he 
left. He got on an airplane and 
fie\\' to anot her statc. I had 
won , but it took more than 
fingerprints to do him in . I had 
to leave the hathroom cloor 
open a crack \\ hen It \\ asn 't 
being used. I had to leave the 
porch lIght on. I had to leave 
crumh.., in the toaster-oven. 
What annoyed him most was 
when I left toc-pri nts on his 
stereo cabinet doors. 

AdmIttedly, [ stooped very 
low to drive L she Lipschitz 
from my life. But the Fates told 
me that I was not finished

Letters to the Editor 

All-nite -
library 
Editor: 

I'm certain all of us have 
walked down the aisles of 
Central or BioMed or S & E 
libraries during finals week, 
searchIng for a booth or desk to 
study at. and finding it very 
difficult to get one. It's like 
that every quarter. It starts 
around Tuesday or Wednes-
day of the tenth week and goes 
on until finals are over. 

It can really be frustrating 
to have to spend so much 
precious t imr searching all 
over all four on·campus 
librartes to find a '>pot to study 
without having any luck. 

At ot her l 'C campuses, such 
a" L.A., Berkelev , and Santa 
Barbara, at least one library 
sta~ s open 24 hOll rs ada} 
during the [inals p riod. ThIS 
IS undoubtedly a simple llOcI 
effectl\'c solution to the 
problem of haVing too little 
library space dUring the mad 
migration to t he monaster\' 
charactenst ic of finals \H'Ck. 

Certainly It would cost a lot 
more to k-eep a li));ary fully 
staffed 2-1 hours a day for 
sewn or ten days . Instead, a 
skeleton staff or- e\ t'n just one 
or t \\0 sl'Curit ~ guaro<; cou Id 
bt.' emploved to remain at tht.· 
hbrarv In place of a "taff of 
hbranans dunng t he extended 
open hours. 

:tudents \\'ould be \\elcome 
and ~tudv, but most sernce .... 

such as checking out oooks, 
using computer cat alogs, etc .. 
would be shut down during 
this time. 

The ex t ra modest amount o[ 
money needed to prOVIde thIS 
... er"lce to the students would 
be more t han counterbalanced 
by t he reduct ion of strain and 
frustratIon encountered bvthe 
students during fin·al'i. 
Besides, if ut her UC campuses 
have it, isn't it only reasonable 
t hat we should too?

Vidal speaks on Brown, peace, and the CIA 
continued from pagE' 5 

... There IS a growing 
perception that what matter 
i the urvival of the human 
race as a whole, and that this 
can only be done by tapping a 
new kind of loyalty ... to the 
larger tribe, the human race. 

.. .I am not a war lover, and [ 
look with perfect contempt 
upon those cheap politicians 
who kept s houting 't he 
Russians are coming' so that 
they can get campaign fund 
from the defense industry. 
They are the enemy .... For the 

moment, thi s military-
industrial-polit ical complex 
has seized the White House, 
and most of the Congress, and 
they govern for now. but [ 
promise you, they will not 
govern forever. 

... We are told, by the Chief 
War-Monger t hat "There is a 
vulnerabi lit y window" 
through which the Russian ' 
intend to fly one night and 
blow us all up. Since we would 
then blow them up the next 
morning, I don't s e the point

that governs this particu lar 
nat ion-s tate t he unmistakable 
message that we no longer 
believe a word that you have to 
say about invented dangers in 
the ju ngl es of f;ma ll countries, 
that we will no longer waste a 
third of our wealth upon the 
mindle 's making of arma-
ments, that if you do not 
change your ways, we will 
remove you from power. And 
we sha ll do so peacefully 
because we want what the 
whole world wants, and that is 
peace, nol only in our time, but 
for all time. We are for life, and 
there is no alternat ive. 
Questions and Answers: 

- Thev asked me to 
characteri,"e him (Brown) and 
I "aid what I thInk, 'He i~ a 
perfect emptiness. He is 
constantly in motion . He's sort 
of our ixon - he jUf; t runs for 
office, and runs for office, and 
runs for office ... if anything 
burn" out what brain celb YOU 
ha\e, It'~ runnIng for office. 

- If [ were the American 
Presldl'nt, or If [ were In an\' 
position to program him. 
which i~ what we do no\\', give 
him cue cards, [ would gl\ e 
Ron t he following cue card: 'I 
am in Mm;cow.' I think an 
American President should be 
willing .. to go to Moscow ... and 
simply say, '\Ve are serious 
about arms control.' 

- Vidal quoting Mondale at 
dinner. "You know, you really 
don't get much more from the 
CIA than you do from the ew 
York Times." I've always 
known this, but I've never 
heard anybody who's been 
Vice· President say it. That 's 
about ten billion dollarb we 
waste. 

- It's going to be the 
internat ional cartels t hal save 
us. [ never thought to hear 
myself ~a) that. but thInk 
about it this way If you were 
Shell, and you\'e got a new 
refinery in L.A ., and a brand 
new office building in New 
York and the Soviet Union 
wants to blow them up, and 
you're providing the Soviet 
Union with oil, you say, "No, 
no, no, no, you can't do that, 
we\e invested a lot in L.A. 
You simply cannot blow up 
L.A, We'll turnofftheoil. " lna 
way, the forces of greed and 
corrupt ion may yet save us. 

- How would [ advise the 
young about whether or not to 
register for 1 he draft? .. .lt 's a 
mailer of everyone's indivi -
dual conscience. I personally 
would not register. 

- As for the Peripheral 
Canal, I'm entirely against 

it .... I . ee no reason why a 
fraction of the money for the 
Peripheral Canal should not be 
going to build de-salinization 
plants up and down the coast. 

- I personally am against 
capital punishment. 

- The Family Protection 
Act is a real lulu. If a young 
woman decides to have herself 
filled for a diaphragm. her 
doctor 1I1Ust then ring up her 
father and tell him .... It might 
well be the end of nuclear 
family as we know it. J would 
drive a st ake through its (FPA) 
heart.

Last year when the Revelle 

Program Board f;JXlnsored a 
campus-wide college bowl 
bet \\ cen faculty and students 
from the four colleges, 
Eckmann went at it again. The 
final match pitted Revelle 
fa ulty against Revelle 
students. Or;lce again , 
Eckmann and his teammate, 
snapped off the right answers 
to clinch a student victory. 
Ansewrs to questions like: 
Name the four major Japanese 
Islands? (Kyushu, Shikoku, 
Honshu, and Hokkaido); What 
are the name of the three 
daughters in the hakespear·

Goneril and Cordelia). 

Remembering the thrill of 
victory and the good times 
t hey had answeri ng questIOns, 
Eckmann approached Kohut 
and asked him 'why not bring 
high schoolers here and start

Nearly 250 student 

simulated the effect of a 
nuclear war by lying "dead" 
on Revelle Plaza yesterday 
afternoon. 

The students. along with 
about another 150 onlook-
ers, had gathered for the 
"die-in,"· an event spon-
sored by organizers of 
Ground Zero Week at 
UCSD. 

Prior to the imulated 
explosion, students listened 
to UC Student Regent Linda 
Sabo read a vivid account of 
the effects of a nuclear 
bomb dropped on downtown 
San Diego. 

To the side of the event. 
members of UCSD's 

unday Croquet Club 
played, ignoring Sabo's 
speech and the "dead" 
bod ies, and cheering a each 
member scored a point . 

Most of the crowd paid 
little attentlon to the club's 
actlVltles. However, several 
people reportedly spit at 
club members, and one 
"Ole-in" entertainer 
attempted to remove some 
of the croquet equipment 
set up on the lawn next to 
Revelle fountain. 

Club President Mark 
Diamond, also an A 
repre entative from Revelle 
College, and a member of 
the College Republicans, 
denied that his group was 

there to interfere with the 
Ground Zero event. 

"It's not a matter of 
in ensitivity," he said, "it's 
a matter of political realities 
... the political realitie of 
playing Sunday croqueL" 

The group has posted 
recruiting signs around 
campus stating: "Please -
tID communi ts, homo, (or) 
undesireable insurgents." 

Club member Lisa 
Sullivan said during the 
rally that it was "naive" for 
Ground Zero organizer to 
believe that "nuclear war i 
holocaustic, and that 
justifies t he reason why 
we would disarm." She Said 
she believed it should take 
something more than 
"holocaustic" to motivate 
the government to disarm, 
but she declined to tate 
what that might be. 

"I think that President 
Reagan is deterring -
preventing - the holocaut 
by building up our 
defense ," he ·aid . 

everal G rou nd Zero 
organizers asked DIamond 
and Sullivan why their 
organizations had not 
responded to requesls for 
their input in planning the 
week's events. The two 
declined to respond , saylOg 
on ly that they were 
ailemptlOg to "rai"e the 
con ciousness" of student~ 
by staglO~ the "obviously 
humorous' game.

Clark and others

By CARMELlTA ROSAL 
SlsII Wriler 

"Economic con ervati'm 
would be targeted into the area 
of ra ·e." said Prof. Kenneth 
Clark. a noted p ychologist. 
during his keynote addre 
co ncluding the two day 
symposium held on April 16-17 
at sro 's Sumner Auditorium. 

Thirteen ot her distin · 
gu ished cholars. lawyers. and 
educator, including Roger 
Wilkin . a Pulitzer prize 
winner. and Harris Wofford. a 
former White House coun elor 
to Pres. John Kennedy on civil 
rights. joined Clark on the two· 
day retrospective of the 

historical legacy of the civil 
rights movement . 

Chancellor Richard At kin-
so n. who introduced the

particularly disappointed at 
the small audience turnout, 
since distingui shed 'peakers 
had been invited to the 
symposium.

House. and he argued that the 
US has a 2.000 warhead 
advantage. In addition. he 
said. our weapon are of 
uperior quality. 
Mondale believes that the 

Reagan position only serves to 
weaken our influence. and 
gives the Soviets the power to 
intimidate our allies. 

The econd premise of the 
Reagan policy is that the US 
ca n win the arms race. 
Mondale. however. claim that 
an increasing upply of 
weapons does not increase our 
security. Escalations hurt us 
because the Soviets will follow 

suit and the cycle will continue 
to . piral upward. He added. 
"the arms race will not be able 
to s top on its own." 

The Reagan administra-
tion's third argument is that 
the oviets don't deserve arms 
control . becau sf of their 
international behavior . 
Mondale ca t egorica ll y 
condemns thi position saying. 
"arms control i not a favor. it 
is essential to our security . It is 
not a gift to them it is in our 
be t interests." Mondale also 
made the point that every 
administration s ince Tru-
man" has ought to decrea 'e 
nuclear arms. except this one. 

The fourth point in the

Reagan rhetoric. according to 
Mondale . is that a nuclear war 
i s winnable . Mond a le 
vehemently tre sed. how-
ever. that in all probability 
nuclear war would end human 
civi lazat ion as we know it. He 
punct uated this point with an 
often quoted line: "The living 
would truly envy the dead ." 

Walter Mondale took many 
opportllnitie in hi speech to 
jab the Reagan administration 
while extolling the virtues of 
the Carter years. In this 
respect he wa peaking as a 
presidential a pirant and not 
a a nonparti an authority on 
the nuclear i sue. as he 
claimed .

insufficient to keep out the 
all. Thi diversion will occur 

during water hort age when 
the farmer need water the 
mo t. 

The legi lation also call for 
the placement of large creens 
to prevent fish and t heir roe 
from being sucked into the 
waterway. The canal plan 
calls for construction of two 
large sections at the north and 
'outh ends of the canal, to be 
connected only if the fi h 
screen prove successful. The 
farm group feels that these 
provision make the bill a 
written too risky. 

There is the po sibility that 
after years of work and 
perhap billion of dollars. the 
canal would never be 
completed. The farmers are in 
favor of an improved water 
delivery system. but feel that 
Propo it ion 9 has too mu ch

from scratch .

Bureau Federation i against

commu nity by no mean 
constit utes a united front. 

everal county farm group. 
are sti ll in favor of Proposition 
9. This 'plit is typical of ot her 
'chisms caused by the issue. 

It i · difficult to get a precise 
figu re for t he co t of 
Proposition 9. but there is no 
doubt it will start in the 
billion and go up from there. 
II is a nine part water projects 
propo al for meeting state 
water needs through t he year 
2000. I n add i tion to the main 
ditch costing$1.3 billion,there 
will be st!\'eral smaller 
channels. reservoirs and 
ground·water storage areas 
costing another $4 .1 billion. 
On top of t he~e outlays. there 
will be money required for 
energy to pump t he water o\'er 
mountains and to \'ariou" 

parts of the state. The~ cost" 
are almost inestimable 
because of the incr asing cost 
of fossil energy. Inflation 
makes calc~ lat ion in the long 
term difficult and the cost of 
Proposition 9 seems to range 
between $2.3 and 23 billion 
dollars depending on whether 
the figure is quoted by a 
proponent of t he canal. or an 
opponent. 

Major financial support for 
the drive to defeat Proposition 
9 has come from J,G . Boswell 
Co. and the alyer Land Co., 
contributing more than half of 
the $850,000 raised as of 
December 31. Another 
£200,000 came from a direct

Miller was just recently 
given a large amount of 
exposure in a week long series 
of interviews on The Dick

restlessly tenuous. Hi s

continue d from page 11 
unexclt mg, The Motels' latest 
album escapes the security of 
past material by venturing 
forth with a surprisingly fresh 
collection of music . "He Hit Me 
(and it fe l t like a kiss)," 
written by Carole King and 
originally performed by the 
Crystals, is an indication that 
while Davis can rea ll y belt 
them out, her singi ng can also 
exude the dept h and richnes 
lacki ng in today's " en itive 

. creamer" female vocali ts. 
"So L.A.," and "Change My 

Mind" just might make it on 
the charts, but real ly, does 
that matter? Just a, long as 
Martha doesn't sell out too 
much, as long as her music 
doesn't adapt itself to pre· 
conditioned pop formulas, Th(' 
Motels will continue to get 
better and better. As people 
cont inu(> to tire of peroxide 
"Blondies," It becomes 

necessary for a new face to hit 
t he scene. J udgi ng from thIs 
album, it just might be Martha 
Davis.

double by Burda in the fifth 
(which may ha\'e been a triple

The UC D squad, playing

Success in soap selling 
wasn't secured ; " I coulda sold 
soap 24 hours a day and still 
never made enough money ," 
so Moss held on tight to the 
chance at UCSD. With the 
security of a regular paycheck, 
he expanded the limits of his 
teaching " ... to the world," he 
ay, with a hug grin. 

"That' when I developed the 
' P s ychology of Sport s 
Officiating' program ... a 
unique opportunity t o 

.students to earn money by 
refereeing local games. 

"The one thing an umpire 
needs, or anybody, is self· 
confidence. If you sell you rself. 
and it you can move around 
like you know what you're 
doi ng, people think you know 
what ~'ou're doing .. .it's ju. t 
the gestures of confidence." 

Since 1971, Moss has 

developed several new ideas. 
The most obvious is his self· 
confidence consulting firm 
called Moss·Cess Unlimited. It 
is prominently advertised br 
the Moss Mobile, a tank· ized 
navy blue Lincoln Continental 
Diesel with yellow and white 
lettering. "You've seen it, 
haven't you?" Bob asks. then 
laughs. " Ri~ht , right , right , 
right, right.' 

Mosl),Cess Unlimited 
actually only has three or four 
paid contract a year, for 
s peeches, assemblies, or 
sem inars. Each contract IS 
worth 400·500 dollars. How 
ever, Moss is currentl y wor· 
king on a Ph.D. and hopes to 
expand Moss-Cess afterwards. 

In addition to his Ph.D .. 
Moss is writing a book on 
sports officiating, which he 
expects to complete '()(1I1 . "It

On Monday night the 1M 
Department hosted its annual 
all-campus open badminton 
tournament. All possible 
division in both si ngles and 
doubles competition w re 
offered. but the be. t play came 
from the singles matches. 

In the women 's competition 
two intercollegiate badminton 
players breezed to t he final s. 
The number one player on the 
intercollegiate team, Monica 
Mils tein, took un the number 
two player, Karen mlth . 

II or to start a mlni·game to 
five. [f the score happens togei 
tied at IOthechoiceiseitherto 
play to 11 as before, or have a 
mini -game to three. 

A men's match i~ the b st 
t\\'o out of three games, with 
games to 15. A set for men 
occurs either at U -13,or 14·14. 
[n the finals Hal Jacobs met 

Men set for playoffs 

The strategy in badminton 
~eems simple . Hit the 
. huttlecock (birdie for YOU 
novices) either high and long. 
or try a dink shot to keep your 
opponent off balance. Wh ile 
bot h the men and women at 
times hit the hultlecock as 
hard as they could the most 
success was obtamed on the 
little dinks that barch' cleared 
lhp net. -

The womens' match was the 
best two out of three games, 
\\'ith games up to 11. Milstein 
lost the first game, 9-12. but 
came back to win the next two 
11 ·7 and 12·10 to become 
champion . In the first and 

~econd games a ~et occurred. 
This happens when. for 

women, the score becomes tied 
at nine apiece or at \0 apiece. If 
it is tied at nine the player who 
previously had the lead can 
choose to continue playing to 

ameer J adkarim. Jacobs had 
a tough time beating Rick Frey 
in hi s semi-final match while 
Sameer eas ily defeated Gene 
Kumehawa. '15·14 and 15·2. 
Sameer took advantage of the 
1 ired Jacobs to win the 
tournament 15-,1. 18·15.
