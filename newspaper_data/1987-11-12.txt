UCSB rally caused by faculty 
appointment of CIA officer 
By AMY COLLINS 
and STEVEN ELZER 
UCSB Daily Nuue 

Thirty-eight students were ar-
rested Thursday as they occupied 
ChanceUor Barbara Ueh~ng' souter 
office to protest the appointment of 
a Central Intelligence Agency 
officer to the UCSB faculty. 

Uehling was not in ~er fifth·f1oor 
Cheadle Hall office when more 
than 150 students stormed the area 
following a noon rally in front of 
Cheadle Hall. However, the chan-
cellor did return to her office later in 
the afternoon, surrounded by uni-
versity police officers. 

Uehling said little to the protes-
ters, telling the group that the 
appointment was a serious matter 
that was still "under review." The 
chancellor is expected to make a 
decision on the matter within the 
next several days. 

Protesters declined to meet with 
Uehling when she offered to discuss 
the issue with eight of the group's 
delegates. Protest organizers said 
they met with the chancellor on the 
issue last week and that they 
believed that no new progress had 
been made. And, the group did not 
want to exclude other students from 
voicing their opinions, the organiz-

ers added. 
The group remained in her outer 

office during the day until Cheadle 
Hall was closed for regular busi-
ness. Police officials arrested the 
remaining students for trespassing. 

Although the arrest procedure 
was calm, eight ciemonstrators 
passively resisted arrest. 

Three opted to receive citations 
for the trespassing, rather than be 
booked into custody at the Santa 
Barbara County )aillike the other 
35 students. Of those arrested, 
seven were members of the Asso-
ciated Students Legislative Coun-
cil, including one executive member. 

"This is an issue that affects 
every member of the UCSB com-
munity and for that reason, we're 
here at the highest office on this 
campus," said Leg Council member 
Todd Gooch, one of the rally 
organizers. 

"If we allow this person [CIA 
Officer George A. Chritton Jr.] to 
retain an official position within the 
University of California faculty , 
then we're setting a precedent that 
says it's okay for members of covert 
organizations to teach in universi-
ties," Gooch explained. "Anyone 
who is interested in preserving the 
ideal of this university has to oppose 
this [appointment] all the way." 

During the takeover, protesters 
had numerous pizzas delivered to 
the chancellor's office and brought 
bananas, water, a box of nacho 
chips and other edibles. 

The group also made use of the 
office phones to contact members 
of the news media and to call UC 
President David Gardner's office. 

The rally, organized by Leg 
Council and the A.S. Student 
Lobby, was held in front of Cheadle 
Hall and was attended by approx-
imately 600 campus community 
members. Former CIA agent John 
Stockwell was scheduled to address 
the crowd, but was unable to attend 
the rally because airfiights were 
cancelled from Los Angeles to 
Santa Barbara. Stockwell told rally 
organizers that he intends to speak 
at UCSB in the near future, accord-
ing to Jaime Acton, director of the 
Student Lobby Annex at UCSB. 

The controversy over Chritton's 
appointment is based in part on the 
belief that his 30-year affiliation 
with the Central Intelligence 
Agency will harm the integrity of 
the university environment. 

Many speakers at the rally 
stressed that it is not the expression 
of Chritton's ideas that they are

Reagan popularity 
partly a myth, say 
UCSD researchers 

By CYNTHIA CHESY 

Is President Reagan a popular 
president? That is one of the ques· 
tions Michael Schudson, chairman 
of the department of communica-
tion, and UCSD sociology gradu. 
ate Elliot King tried to answer in 
their study. "The Myth of the Great 
Communicator," to be published in 
the November/December issue of 
Columbia Journalism Review. 

After studying Gallup polls taken 
from World War II to the present, 

study reported that Dwight D . 
Eisenhower's persona~ty approval 
was 84 percent when his job 
approval was 52 percent. Eighty 
percent of the public liked Lyndon 
Johnson personally when only 48 
percent approved of his job per-
formance_ JohnF. Kennedy's com-
parable figures are 86 percent and 
64 percent; for Richard Nixon, 78 
percent and 55 percent; and for 
Jimmy Carter, 72 percent and 48 
percent, respectively . 

Reagan's personality rating after 

The president may not be as popular as the media has made him 
out to be. 

as well as polls taken in the news-
papers and in professional publica-
tions in political science and public 
opinion research, Schudson and 
King found that myths have been 
constructed around the issue of 
Reagan's popularity. 

One of the myths surrounding 
Reagan's popularity was that dur-
ing the first two years of his admin-
istration, he had the highest popu-
larity rating of any n~wly-elected 
president in the post-World War II 
period. According to the study, "all 
presidents are popular in their 
'honeymoon' period in office [the 
first two years] . .. The unusual 
thing with Reagan is that he was 
less popular than any other newly-
elected president during this pe-
riod." 

The Gallup poll showed that 
Reagan's general approval rating 
was 44 percent, while public ap-
proval of his personality was 69 
percent. "This is a perfectly ordi-
nary disparity ," Schudson said in 
an interview. Schudson's and King's 

two years was 37 percent, 35 
points lower than Eisenhower's; 19 
points lower than Nixon's; 13 points 
lower than Carter's; and 33 points 
lower than Kennedy's. 

But what is the significance of 
these findings? 

"The myth that the media and 
others pervaded was that here was 
a guy that was so personally chao 
rismatic that that overcame all 
normal processes of public opinion 
formation," Schudson said. "The 
fact is that it didn't .. . the opinion 
about him as reflected in the polls 
was essentially the same as with 
other presidents . . . Because few of 
us read and analyze the polls, we 
must have gotten the myth of Rea-
gan's popularity from the media. 
The media published the polls, but 
they :;ystematically misunderstood 
them, and assumed a degree of 
popularity that was not reflected in 
the polk" 

Schudson believes that those 
assumptions were generated in the 
Washington political community

Tumor registries to be 
set up across California 

An application by a consortium of San 
Diego and Imperial County groups and 
agencies to establish a Regional Tumor 
Registry has been accepted by the State 
Department of Health Services . 

The approval , received by Dr. Sidney 
L. Saltzstein of the UCSD Cancer Cen-
ter, means that the consortium - San 
Diego and Imperial Organization for 
Cancer Control (SANDIOCC) - can 
move ahead and establish a local Regis. 
try office. "We're aiming for a Jan. 1, 
1988, opening," Dr. Saltz stein said. 

The proposed opening puts the two-
county area in compliance with a state 
law, passed in 1985, which requires that 
tumor registries be set up throughout 
California by July 1, 1988, and be fully 
operational by July 1, 1990_ 

The 1985 legislative act mandated 
that cancer would be a "reportable" dis-
ease for the entire state, thus establi shing 
what will become the largest cancer data 
in the U.S. to include an entire popula-
tion, rather just a sample of it. 

By reigistering certain data for every 
Californian who develops cancer, a tool 
will be available to obtain accurate 
information on the total number of new 
cases of cancer each year, as well as 
type, location, extent and the age, race, 
sex and location of the patient, Dr. Saltz-
stein noted.

mum wage, on-campus wages will 
follow suit. 

Karla Yates, head of sta ff of the 
IWC, has a different opinion. She 
maintains the subminimum wage 
proposal was drafted wi th the stu· 
dents' best inte rest in mind. She 
said that among the factors that led 
to the commiss ion's proposa l was 
the possibility that a higher min-
imum wage wculd cause employ-
ers to layoff their newer employees, 
who are usua ll y young and include 
many students. 

Yates strongly aenied that the 
subminimum wage proposal was 
intended to placate employers who 
might lobby hard to stop the min-
imum wage hike. She added that 
the commi ssion based its proposal 

on the findings of more wh.at was 
best for the state and the California 
student population, but she refused 
to go into detail, citing the large 
volume of paper. 

Yates a lso commented that "our 
findings " indicated tha t minorities 
were going to benefit from the 
lower wage proposal. The UCSA 
disagrees strongly with Yate. on 
this point , commenting in a bulletin 
that the proposal would "have a 
disproportionately negative impact 
on minority and economically disad· 
vantaged students," and tha t these 
are the students who depend mosl 
heavily on their jobs to cover their 
educational expenses. 

The UCSA bulletin a lso made a 
plea for support to the UC student 
body, asking students to contact 
their representatives for more infor-
mation about the proposal and on 
how to take action on the issue. ITa 

Brett Franklin believes that the new wage proposal will hurt UC 
students academically.

Part II 

Understanding the co-ops 
By THOMAS CANTY 

Editor 's note: Part I of "Under-
standing the Co-ops" attempted to 
explain the current set-up of stu-
dent legislative bodies at UCS D, 
whose decisions affect the co-ops. 
Thomas Canty gave his interpreta-
tion of the lease issue and led up to 
what he believes to be the m ost 
important issue involving co-ops 
and their relationship to the admin-
istration: the autonomy and ac-
countability of the co-ops. 

Before proceeding to Part II, 
som e corrections and clarifications 
concerning Part I are in order. 

• Thoma s Ca nty was the co-op 
representative to the UCB last year, 
not a m ember of the Universi ty 
Center Board (UCB). 

• The co-op representative to 
the UCB acts as the chairperson 
for the Co-op and Enterprise Sub-
committee of the UCB (C&E). 

• B y definition , the co-ops 
potentially funded by the UCB are 
not "consumer co-ops_" Seeing 
this term as misleading, Canty ref-
ers to them in Part II as , simply, 
co-ops . 

• In 1985 the S tudent Center 
Board (SCB) became the UC B. 
Canty uses SCB when referring to 
events prior to 1985. 
History 

A little bit of the background of 
the co-ops is necessary for an 
understanding of what type of 
autonomy they enjoy. 

In 1967 the New Indicator 
emerged out of the anti -war 
movement. KSDT was founded in 
the late '60s, moving into the Stu-
dent Center upon its opening. In 
1984 KSDT was officially recog-
nized by C&E as a co-op. Ground-
work Books was a sell-sufficient 
entity started in Solana Beach. 
Shortly after the Student Center 
was built Groundwork Books 
moved in , having opera ted pre-
viously from a bookstand on Revelle 
Plaza. 

In 1975 the Computer Co-op 
was founded . Since its establish-
ment the Computer Co-op has 

become an auxiliary account 01 the 
UCB. In 1977 -78 the A.S . lunded 
students 01 the Organic Gardening 
Club to start a larm north 01 Third 
College. The club became the Tor-
rey Farms Co-op in 1981. In 1982 
the name changed to the Farm Co-
op , along with the move 01 the co-
op to behind the Che Cafe , the 
Food Co-op and the UCB. 

During the summer of 1978, the 
Food Co-op was estab lished . The 
initial capital was borrowed from 
members of the co·op. After a year 
of operation the Student Center 
Board a llocated $5,000 to buy the 
lirst equipment lor the Food Co-op. 
In a ddition , the A.S. loaned the 
Food Co-op starting funds in the 
1979-80 school year , which have 
since heen paid back. 

The UCSD Bike Shop, origi-
nally a co-op, was started with a 
loan from an outside source. How-
ever, the manager was fired , due to 
major inconsistencies in the finan-
cial accounts; and the administra -
tion took control thereby eliminat-
ing the collective structure . In the 
fall 01 1979, the Recycl ing Co-op 
became a separate entity from the 
Food Co-op. The Recycling Co-op 
was never allocated any sta rt-up 
funding Irom the SCB. During the 
1979-80 school year, the A.S. 
proposed Assorted Vinyl as a 
record co-op, but A ssorted Vinyl 
soon dropped the collective struc-
ture a nd stopped offering discou nts 
to other co-ops. It continued oper-
ating as a n A.S. enterprise. 

In the winter of 1980, the CoHee 
Hut came under the jurisdiction of 
the SCB. The space was going to 
be demolished , when stud e nts 
stepped forward with the proposal 
lor the Che Cafe. The SCB linanced 
the materials needed for renova-
tio ns of the space , and the Recy-
clin g Co-op loaned the Che lunds 
for operating inventory. 

In the summer 01 1980, some 
Food Co-op members started the 
General Store Co-op. The SCB 
purchased the initial equipment 
(cash registers and some shelves) 
and loaned the General Store

tory. The General Store has had 
many personal loans Irom the UCB 
lor expansion since their estab· 
lishment. 
Funding 

For the most part , the co -ops 
ha ve funded themselves through 
sell-generated income and loans. 
The UCB has had a minor role in 
the funding of co-ops. Historically, 
the UCB has lunded some of the 
initial purchase 01 equipment and 
beginning inventory for a lew of the 
co·ops. In addition, the UCB has 
a lways covered the cost 01 utilities 
for the entire Student Center , as 
well as the maintenance of the 
lacilities. 

The C&E subcommittee has also 
received lunding. Since 1981 the 
money in the C&E budget has gone 
toward: individual co-op expansion; 
co-op sponsored events; the fund-
ing 01 maintenance contrac ts lor 
university-purcha 'ed registers and 
scales; travel money for co-op con-
ferences; and office equipment and 
supplies lor the C&E office. A s 
long as the co·ops have existed 
there has never been an oHicial pol-
icy a ' to what type of funding they 
should receive, and whether it 
should be in the form 01 allocations 
or loans. Precedents have been set 
In the past , but are currently being 
questioned . 

The type 01 funding the co -ops 
have received has been diHerent for 
each co-op . Groundwork Books 
has never received any allocations 
lor the purchase 01 equipment and 
the upgrading 01 the facility.

w hy th e curre nt relationship 
between the co-ops and the UCB is 
being eva luated and why a conllic t

Reggae article causes a 
splash: A.S. president 
responds 
Editor: 

Alter the success 01 last Satur-
day's Reggae Splash, I expected 
Monday's Guardian headline to 
read " Thousands enjoy reggae 
splash" - not "Reggae concert 

shut down," as it read. 
It is unfortunate that an event 

that was a succelll lor over 7 hours 
was cut a lew minute5 short. It is 
even more unlortunate, though , 
that Elizabeth Maynard emphas-
ized only negative aspects of the 
event and even misreported others . 
The article highlighted the "angry 
crowds," alcohol problems, and 
citizen complaints. What about the 
scores of students who were en-
chanted by the great music. great 

dancing, and great lood? What 
about the lact that three associates 
- the A .S., Third College, and the 
ASSU - spent hundreds 01 hours 
planning this event lor the enjoy-
ment 01 students? 

Negative publicity like Mayn. 
ard's article will only encourage the 
community to complain and dis· 
courage Irom planning such events 
in the luture . I hope , and am conli-
dent, that this type 01 journalism is

Continued from paRe 5 
hoI and drugs were responsable for 
the concert's ending before 10 pm. 

Without question there were in-
dividuals drinking akohol and smok-
ing marijuana that evening. This 
however , had nothing to do with 
the show prematurely ending. The 
sole reason for the police stopping 
the show was the numerous com-
plaints received from the residents 
in the neighborhood south of 
campus. 

Instead of chastising Miss May-
nard , I would like to clarify how the 
event was produced . The ASUCSD 
conceived the idea of a Reggae 
Splash in response to the Student 
Body's interest in higher quality 
performers. Saturday's performers 
included some of the best local as 
well as international acts in reggae 
musIc. 

The actual production of the 
event began back in ' July when 
arrangements were made for every-
thing from the sound system to the 
port·a·potties. As to the sponsor· 
ship of the event to which Miss 
Maynard describes as being "stu· 
dent organized," this year'. Splash 
was produced by the ASUCSD, 
Third College and the AASU. The 
funds that paid for the event came 
from the student activity fees paid 
by students at the beginning of 
each quarter. In this sense it was 
student sponsored. 

A final point of clarification should 
be made concerning why the Reg-
gae Splash was shut down by 
UCSD police. Starting at approxi-
mately 4 pm complaints were made 

. by the community. In order to keep 
the San Diego police from entering 
the grounds, UC police had to take 
action. Alter several attempts were 
made to lower the sound, the band 
was ordered to stop the perform. 
ance . 

As you can see the production of 
an event like Reggae Splash '87 
represents an enormous expendi-
ture of time and money . The fact 
that it ended forty.five minutes 
early was unfortunate. This how. 
ever, should not obscure the fact 
that students enjoyed seven hours 
of a first class production.

opposed to. but rather the idea of 
·having a faculty member pledged 
to disinformation. " We'd love for 
him to come onto campus and 
speak, but the distinction comes 
when he is affiliated with the UCSB 
faculty, " Leg Council member Dan 
Zumwinkle said . 

"With a CIA agent having been 
welcomed to the UCSB faculty, a 
fact which will be widely noted, we 
could well see host countries turn-
ing down the nomination of given 
Fulbright professors ; we can also 
see students in our Education 

Abroad Program encountering 
grave troubles , as would graduates 
of majors which lead to overseas 
careers," said history department 
Associate Professor Nancy Gal· 
lagher, reading from a history 
department petition protesting 
Chritton's appointment. 

"Most serious of all, as the 
anthropologists have pointed out, 
lives of American researchers have 
in the past been endangered by 
suspicions of being connected in 
any way with the CIA," Gallagher 
continued . The peition was signed 
by 14 faculty members of the his· 
tory department. 

Leg Council, the Graduate Stu· 
dent' Association, the Political 

Science Graduate Association, the 
anthropology department and other 
groups have all opposed the 
appointment of Chritton as a 
teacher in the political science 
department. 

UCSB could have various 
speakers on campus, including 
criminals. who would tell the truth 
about their activities , history Pro· 
fessor Frank Frost argued . "We 
could have rapists or pimps or child 
pornographers [speak] on this 
campus, but the one difference 
between George Chrillon and a 
rapist, pimp or a child pornographer 
is that we know he's not going to tell 
the truth, " he said. And , Chrillon 
has " no sc holarly credentials ," 

Frost added. 
"It seems to be easier to hire a 

CIA agent on this campus than to 
hire minority faculty on this cam· 
pus," department of black studies 
associate professor Dr. Gerard 
Pigeon said. Pigeon also expressed 
concern about a lack of moral con· 
sciousness among CIA agents. 

Although Stockwell was not on 
hand to give an inside view of CIA 
operations, other speakers at the 
rally discussed crimes allegedly 
committed by the CIA. Lucy 
Phillips.Edwards, who recently 
spent 16 months in Nicaragua , told 
the crowd that of 52 deaths she 
documented there, 51 were a ttrib· 
uted to the CIA·backed contras.

Allowing an agent of the CIA to 
teach at UCSB is "legitimizing the 
CIA to a certain extent by opening 
up to them the status that'. aslO· 
cia ted with the university environ· 
ment ," Gooch said . 

Although the crowd was gener· 
ally anti.CIA, many less vocal 
proponents were on hand as well . 
"I think this is an institution of free 
speech and access to varying opin. 
ions should be available ," said 
Larry Parsons, a UCSB employee. 
"This is a demonstration against 
the CIA and that's not the issue, the 
issue is teaching," he said. "After

Marines recruit on campus -why

father's imprisonment a/ the hands 
of the ruling regime in Iran , as well 
as an explanation of why the 
&ha 'is are being persecuted. .E. 
requested anonymity , and wants it 
known that he feels no enmity 
toward Iranians or Muslims. 

The persecution of the largest 
religious minority in Iran, the Baha'i 
failh . has a long history. Viewed by 
the current Iranoan regime as a 
herehcal spilt-off sect of Islam. the 
population that recentlv numbered 
some 500,000 bel.ev;rs has been 
the target of an organozed, pre-
medItated genocide . 

In the 1850s, the teachings of 
the Bab and Baha'u' lluah. two Per· 
sian holy men , began to take hold 
on the masses. In reaction. the reI.· 
gious/ polItical authorities Incited 
riots against the Baha'is. The Baha'i 
were excuted or banished, and 
literally tens of thousand of follow-
er. were martyred . Baha'is were 
burned, drawn and quartered, 
stoned by mobs, and inflicted upon 
with nea rly every other torture their 
a sailants could invent . These a-
buses were noted by French mil-
itary observers. and drew comment 
from novelist Leo Tolstoy and his -
torian Arnold T oynbee. 

It would be easy to excuse such 
events as mere barbarity of history, 
but things have been no different in 
the Iran 01 the 1980s. In the last 8 
years. the same methods of ha r-
rassment, toture and murder have 
been used on Baha'is . For exam-
ple, on Nov. 22 , 1980 a Baha'i 

sheepherder, Muhammad-Husayn, 
a nd his wife, were attacked and 
beaten , then covered in kerosene 
and set afire. Several weeks ago, 
six Baha'is were abducted , and 
possibly executed_ 

These accounts and numerous 
others are detailed in the written

that have been killed or put in pri-
son for refusing to recant. 

One UCSD student is directly 
affected by the ongoing pogrom. 
S.E_ has a father in prison because 
he is a declared Baha'i. 

One night in 1983 the Revolu-
tionary guards came to S.E.'s 
house. They said they wanted to 
search the place for Baha'i book., 
and anything 01 religious nature. 
They also wanted to take his father 
away . 

Alter calling the civil authority, 
who said, "go along with their 
wish," S.E.'s father complied_ The 
civil authority purports to dis· 
tinguish between free-lance ter· 
rorists who kill Baha'is out of re-
ligious fanaticism and the "legi-
timate" Revolutionary guard. (Nu-

merous re ports by the sources pre-
viously mentioned testify that some-
times the terro rists are the guards}. 

S .E.'s fa ther was released on bail 
the nex t day. S.E. said that in the 
meantime, " My mom did not know 
a nything about what ha ppened to 
him . Being in consta nt fear 01 being 
a rrested is a horrifyinig experi. 

" ence. 

Nine months later, S.E.'8 lather 
was again called away to prison, 
where he remains. There was no 
public trial. His crime, punishable 
in this case with eight years in pri· 
son , is bein g a Baha'i. 

Fortunately, S. E.'s father is not 
being mistreated. He was once 
allowed a three day leave, and his 
mother is permitted to visi t him 
every other week. 

S .E. said , "About four months 
ago I got a chance 10 talk with hi m. 
I got a feeling that he is the same 
Dad I always knew. He did not 
have any signs of anxiety or fear of 
going back to prison ... and his 
drawings and paintings are full of 
hope. They show a feeling of being 
free." 

S .E. commented that the Ba ha'is 
who are put in prison feel it is one of 
the ways 10 serve their cause to 
make the Baha'i ideals known. 
Among these are non-violence a nd 
obedience to the government, wher-
ever this does not violate what 
Baha'is regard as spiritual prin-
ciples. 

In much the same way that 
Gandhi predicted that the oppres-
sor will topple under his own weight 
when laced by people who practice 
non-violence, the Baha'is alsa be-
lieve they shall prevail through 
practicing what they believe, rather 
than attacking what they do not 
believe. Hence, the guards do not 
encounter armed resistance from 
Baha'is. It is Baha'i custom to sur-
render one's good., freedom, or life 
before harming another. According 
to witnessel, one Baha'i martyr in 
Birjand, Iran, handed his tormen-
tors his own matches and offered 
them hi, own kerosene when they 
threatened to burn him. 

S .E. said that the reason Baha'is 
don't hold resentment toward those 
people that inflict punishment on

The Grove grows up 
By BARRY HARRIS 

so, the Registrar really did it to you this quarter. They gave you one of those pesky hour 
breaks between classes. Not enough 
time to go home and relax , or even 
hit the library to squeeze in some 
sellous study (takes a t least 4 5 
minutes to warm up the calcula tor, 
right?). W atcha gonna do? 

A common solution to passing 
th is ex tra hour is to go to that cozy 
lillie place tucked away in the euca-
lyptus grove, where trees grow up 
through the floor a nd benches, the 
Grove Caffe. 

T he Cafll; had a faintly contro-
versial genesis 18 months ago. 
Initiated by Brad Silen A.S. presi-
dential advisor on special projects 
in an agreement between the A.S _ 
and the Cralts Center, the Caffe 

was built utilizing $17 ,000 in stu-
dent funds for materials and equip-
ment, and Crafts Center labor, 
much 01 it volunteer. The Grove 
Calle has since moved into the 
black, prolits (and losses) being 
split 50/ 50 between the A _S. and 
Crafts Center. Recent purchases of 
much needed new equipment - a n 
espresso machine and a refrigera-
tor - has expanded and improved 
the service provided by the Caffe. 

You don'i have to dress entire ly 
in blac k, nor be a grad student 
eternally two years away from 
completing a disserta tion to go to 
the Caffe either. T he Caffe is meant 
lor the entire UCSD communi ty. 
Calling it popular is an understate-
ment. Employees say the rush beg-
ins at 9 am and doesn't let up until 3 
pm. Vacant tables a re of len ha rd to 
lind . 

Empty chairs? This photo must have been taken before 9 or after 3 
- the only times of day when the Caffe isn 't bursl ing with people.

"We really don't have any room 
for expansion," said Robert Fra nkl, 
manager of the Caffe. The Craft s 
Ce nte r requires the remaining deck 
space and there is not much more 
open land in which to build addi. 
tional deck space. Crowding is a 
problem that naturally develops 
when patrons are not rushed away. 
Regular restaurants are "come, eal, 
go ." Frankl's goal is to promote a 
non -r ushed atmosph ere at the 
Ca ffe. 

But that's really the whole idea 
- to take advantage of ou r Cali · 
fornia weather in crea ting a relax· 
ing, pleasant, non-pretentious place 
to sit down, meet with frie nds and 
maybe fi nish 011 the tai l end of that 
problem set. 

So me of the cooler T A~ conduct 
their office hours at the Caffe. Part 
of this market may have crossed 
over Irom the Pub. Aside from that 
limited sector , the Calle and the 
Pub don't compete, insisted Frankl. 

" We don 't have cooking fac il i-
ties," he explained. The Caffe pro· 
cures its coffees from the Pann i kin 
a nd Its pastries a nd croissants from 
A La F rancaibe a nd Judy's muf-
fins. More bubstantia l food must be 
sought at the Pub, or the other 
campus food servIces. 

The ~dminl s tra tive assistant of 
the Grove Ga llery, Mary Ann 
Callery, noted with a pproval that 
having such an in-demand neigh-
bor as the Caffe has increased the 
visibility and popularity 01 the 
gallery as well. 

For your sipping a nd socia lizing 
pleasure the Grove Caffe is open 
Monday through Thursday from 
7:45 am to 11 pm and on Friday 
from 7:45 am to 5 pm. (Q

them is that they are trying to live 
out a counterexample to old, hab· 
itual ways of con/lict resolution. He 
said that the world has evolved to a 
point where violence and war are 
no longer acceptable. In an in-
terdependent world , racial fa na-
ticism i~ too da ngerous, a nd out-
moded to be of any use to anyone. 

According to S.E., the Baha'is 
promote the idea of "unity in diver-
sity." He explained, "The Baha'is 
are a variety of diversified people, 
representmg 1,600 different tribes 
a nd na tions, coming together and 
worki ng for a common cause, a nd 
tha t is the unity of huma nity." In 
order to tum the current racial , ideo-
logical , a nd religious conflict into 
cooperation. S.E. believes that 

people need to simulta neously ap-
precia te cul tural diversity while co-
operatmg for common goals like 
peace and international economic 
development. 

To Westerners, many 0/ the 
principles that Baha 'is hav.: been 
trying to promote in Ira n for the last 
140 years seem reasonable. Among 
other th ings, the Baha 'is are trying 
to promote the equality of men and 
women, the harmony of sc ience 
a nd religion , a nd the importance of 
scrutinous inves tigation of religious 
claims, They hold that the world 's 
religions are not in competition, but 
rather tha t they a ll come from the 
sa me source. Naturall y, these be-
liefs have not endeared the Baha'is

mentalists. S.£. noted that inside 
and especially outside Iran, many 
Muslims do respect the Baha'is. 

Moreover, the Baha'is propose 
many changes to the world social 
order, such as a universal language 
to be learned in addition to one's 
native tongue, a world governing 
body based on a federation of 
nations, and an international sys· 
tern of justice which would elimi· 
nate the extremes 01 wealth and 
poverty, i.e., a decentralized eco· 
nomic system that gives free play 
to individual creativity and initia· 
tive but is based on cooperation 
and reciprocity. 

Recently, the international body 
of Baha 'is has been calling for a 
worldwide summit of all the world 
leaders (not just their envoys and 
diplomats) to convene and discuss 
what keeps our world divided and 
discuss how these differences can 
be resolved. S.E. believes that this 
call for peace can only work if it is 
supported by the people whom 
world leaders represent. S.E. and 
other students in the Baha'i Club at 
UCSD have given copies of this 
peace statement to Chancellor At· 
kinson and other leaders on cam· 
pus. 

Editor's note: In Monday 's issue 
it U}(IS incorrectly reported that 
thousands of Baha 'is have been 
massacred by the current Iranian 
regime. Recent sources have con· 
tradicted this information saying 
that the number is closer to several 
hundred.

Defending a title 
Volleyball out to win fourth 
NCAA Division III title 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sport. Editor 

"We are attempting to be the 
first team ever in NCAA Division 
III history to win back-to-back 
national titles ," boasted UCSD's 
women 's volleyball coach Doug 
Dannevik in a press conference 
Tuesday _ 

The team has already disting-
uished itself as the first team in all 
NCAA divisions to win three titles 
with their championship last year. 

"We will be looking to extend 
that record to four titles, " said 
Dannevik_ Although the T ritC'ns 
have been ranked number one in 
the tournament , the road to victory 

Coach's box 

will not be an easy one_ 
Although they receive a bye in 

the first round of competition 
(beginning today at 5 in the Triton 
Pavillion) , five of the six teams are 
ranked in the top twenty ; three of 
them , CSU San Bernardino, Colo-
rado College, and UCSD, are in the 
top ten_ 

The team 's first match will be on 
Friday at 7:30 pm against the 
winner of the match between CSU 
San Bernardino and University of 
La Verne_ UCSD's athletic officials 
are hoping for a large turnout as 
they have presented a bid to host 
the National Tournament and 
crowd size is one of the determining 
factors for choosing a location_ (g

Player profile: 
interview with 
Janet Hughes 
By STEPHAN BAK 
G_Man Intern 

Sitting on the stairs of the Main Gym with a forlorn look in her eyes, Janet 
Hughes seemed to be gearing up 
for the practice session thaI' was 
soon to begin_ She wore a pair of 
worn blue shorts and a simple T-
shirt. At 5'10" with a slender phy-
sique, she looked like a typical vol-
leyball player. Typical as in Michael 
JurJi:ln is a typical basketball player. 

UCSD volleyball coach Doug 
Dannevik commented on how much 
of an asset she was for the team_ 
He also commented on how much 
she has improved from previous 
years both physically a nd men-

necessarily in Division I. " 
" In Division I, there is greater 

recruiting, but coaching is more 
like being a travel agent ," Stan-
fo rth said regarding the fact that 
Division I athletes already pos-
sess a lot of talenl and ability_ " I 
prefer to be with atheletes that 
need development." 

Stanforth is replacing Andy 
Skief, who held the coaching posi-
tion as well as the position of full-
time physical education instruc-
tor. Stanforth feels that his new 
exclusive position reflects the 
school's new commitment toward 
rebuilding the track and cross

tally. "She definitely has more con-
trol and discipline," he said _ Her 
perfurmance has drawn more spec-
tatofll and her aggressive playing 

. style has been a consistent crowd 
pleaser_ 

Janet has been nominated as an 
All-American. And along with 
teammate Carol Lipson, she is in a 
select group considered for player 
of the year honors_ She is also the

SPORTS 

Women's basketball preview St f th ing. "Our women, and maybe an or even ou.r men ,~ave a.ch~~ce to 
Win reglOnals, he saId . It wtll Entering her twelfth season as 

head coach of the UC San Diego 
Tritons, Judy Malone welcomes 
back nine players from a successful 
1986-87 team that finished with a 
record of IS-II . 

This year's team will offer a 
combination of experienced UCSD 
players and a group of newcomers 
which has Malone predicting that 
the team will continue to improve_ 

"Even though our team is rather 
young with just one senior, we have 
a lot of experience and the most 
top-to-bottom depth we've ever 
had," Malone said _ "We lost a pair 
of aggressive defensive players in 
Shanda Elzy and Sandy Keaton, 
so we'll have a lot of work to do 
defensively; but I expect our defense 
to be grea tly improved ." 

T he additions of the three-point 
shot to women's basketball seems 
to be tailor-made for returning guard 
Tracy Raga tz, the top returning 
scorer with 9.3 points per game_ 
Meanwhile, the inside strength of 
returnees Chris McCallum, Shelli 
Velie a nd Jill Koster will bolster the 
Tritons ' attack beneath the bOflrds . 
McCallum. the lone senior on the 
team, brings experience as a three-
year starter a nd an aggressive del-
ensive style to the team_ Velie , a 
junior, averaged 7 _1 points last 
year while Koster, a sophomore, 
averaged 9 .2 points and a team-
high of 8 . I rebounds. 

Returning guards also include 
junior Anne Goodger and sopho-
more Nancy Caparaz, a long with 
juniors Michelle Krueger, Nadirah 
Scott and sophomore Chris Ely at 

"Even though our team is rather young 
with just one senior, we have a lot of expe-
rience and the most top -to-bottom depth 
we've ever had. " 

Defense has been the trademark 
of Malone's teams, as evidenced 
by the mere 57 _ 9 points allowed 10 
Triton opponents last year _ Hut the 
team shot just 39 percent from the 
floor and 52 percent from the line, 
two areas of the game Malone is 
expecting marked improvement in 
this year.

Malone may have landed a pair 

of super transfers in Michele Leoh-
ner, 5'10" forward who came to 
UCSD from U.S . Internationa l, a 
Division I school, and Beth Koenig, 
a 5'7" guard who played for a suc-
cessful Division II team at the Uni-

Shannon Williams, came to UCSD 
from Whittier College and at 5'1 1" 
wi ll add much·needed height to the 
inside game. 

Rounding out the new players on 
the Triton squad are Katrin Mack· 
arehtschian, a 5'6" guard whose 
basketball experiences has been in 
W est Germany , and Bernadette 
Diepenbrock, a 5 ' 11 " freshman 
from Burlingame High School in 
San Mateo. 

" If we have a major weakness 
this year it will be size inside, " 
Malone said. "Michelle Krueger is 
6'2" but is coming off knee surgery 
and will need a complete recovery 
to be effective. At 5 ' 11 ", J ill Koster 
is going to have to be our rebound-
ing leader." 

Malone's coac hing sta ff will 
again include Jan Martin, now in 
her fifth season as a UCSD assist· 
ant, and first.year assistant coach 
Tina Garcia. 

The Tritons' schedule this sea-
son is one of the toughest in the 
school's history, featuring a strong 
field at the Chapman Tournament 
with San Francisco State and UC 
Santa Barbara , another formidable 
slate a t the UCSD Tourney, and 
regular season games against sev-
eral out·of-state and traditional local 
powers. 

UCSD will open its season on 
Nov. 14 with the annual Alumni 
Game before travelling to the Red-
la nds Tournament on November 
20-23 . The official home opener 
will be on Dec. 12 when the Tritons 
take on Northern Mon -

"There are still some a reas that 

need to be addressed," Stanforth 
said . "The cr0811 country team 
had no difficulty al being competi-
tive righl away, but the track 
team needs lOme work." 

Recruiting high school students 
as possible freshmen has already 
begun for track and cron coun-
try, Stanforth lIaid _ He feel II that 
the new athletic facility will al80 
attract incoming athlete •. 

"It'll be three to five yean 
before we're looking at a com-
plete track program," Stanforth 
said, "a couple of recruiting classes 
allea.t." 

The new athletic facility being 
built near the Supercomputer is 
expected to be completed in spring 
of '89 _ Stanforth hopes that it will 
be ready in January of '89 110 that 
it can be used for the track »ea-
IOn_ 

Stanforth is especially pleased 
with hi. a.sistant coaching staff. 
He has four aasistanls, all with 
strong track experience_ He empa-
thizes with Andy Skief for quitting 
his coaching polition. "Andy had 
both team. all by himself with no 
support," he said_ "The old teams 
did what they could, given the 
means they had ," 

Stanforth is pleased with the 
crolll country team's performance 
thus far, even without any recruit-

forth wants to place more empha· 
sis on a summer running program, 
either through a summer camp or 
by starting practice earfier . 

Stanforth is concerned about 
having enough people for the 
track team. "We have a lot of 
middle and long distance runner5," 
he said , "we need jumpers, sprin. 
ters and woman throwers,'''' He 
has already IHtIlt out flyers to 
recruit athletes for the winter, and 
is in the process of contacting last 
year's team members. Over spring 
break, he hopes to travel to Ariz-
ona with the team for a meet and 
for training. 

Stanforth said that he likes to 
have a large team and is already 
thinking of ways to have as many 
people competing as possible . He 
will even accept people with no 
track experience. He stressed that 
anyone that is interested should 
give him a call at Canyonview 
recreation department. 

" My only rule for team mem-
bers is that everyone corne to 
practice and that everyone tries 
their be.t," he said. 

Optimistic about the track and 
cross country programs here at 
UCSD, Stanforth said, " I'D be 
disappointed if year·in and year· 
out we're not favored to win. 
Then I will know that I'm not 
doing my job." ~

Cross country heads 
to regionals 
The men's and women's cross 

country teams head to Chrystal 
Springs Cross Country Course this 
weekend to participate in the cross 
cou ntry regional tournament. 

The winning team plus the top 
five women and the top three men 
finishers not on the winning teams 
will qualify to run in the national 
tournament next weekend . 

Hughes 
Continued from page 12 
the number of fans that a ttend the 
games is not large, Janet says that 
the support the team does get is 
tremendous. 

When asked if her commitment 
to volleyball has detracted from 
other activities, she sighed and 
commented on how her busy sche· 
dule has practically eliminated any 

semblance of a social life . The 
team has a pol icy of no alcohol 
consumption a t least 24 hours 
before a game. With games occur· 
ring on weekends, it would seem 
like a tough rule to swallow. But 
Janet says that the team more than 
willingly abides by it. 

Janet admits that volleyball has 
affected her school work, but she 
insists that it's worth the sacrifice. 
" It 's taught me to be more com· 
petitive and it's also strengthened 
my character." She added though 

that she does sometimes think about 
how nice it would be to have a 
boyfriend to lean on. However, she 
hinted that her game would pro· 
bably suffer and that 's not some· 
thing she is willing to do at the 
moment. 

The tea m ranked first in Division 
III last year. They are again ranked 
number one in the country thi s 
year. Coach Dannevik has hopes 
of repeating last year's winning 
seas9n. While not stating outright 
that they will take the top spo t 

again, he said it would be a real 
disappointment if they didn't. "As 
long as we don 't have injuries, 
we're in good shape," he said. 

Regarding her future plans, Janet 
said she wouldn't mind playing for 
a European team a fter graduation. 
As for now, with Division III finals 
coinciding with academic finals, 
the team will be under a lot of pres· 
sure . But with the team performing 
as well as they are now. it's a safe 
bet that UCS D volleyball will again 
bring home the trophy. (f)

BudMan's 3 on 3 Playoff Preview 
Sunday nig ht both the M ain Gym andRec Gym 

w ill be the Sig ht of the 3·on -3 Basketba ll c ha m· 
pl onshlps Described by 1M cza r Scott Berndes 
as the toughest l·hour workout In 1M sports, 
3-on·3 allows gym rats a tune·up for Winter 
Q uarter's full c ourt competition The pre limina ry 
round of playo ff s was concluded tast sunday the 
survivors will b a ttle this Sunday night start ing at 
4 ,0 0 Start ing times are as follows. 
A AA ·7 00 Main Gym, AA (over .500)· 4.00 Main 
Gym: AA (under 500)· 6:00 Rec Gym; A (over 
5 00)·6'00 Main Gym, A (under .500 ) - 4 :00 Rec 
Gym 

In the AAA d iVISion It has to be the Thundering 
~d, hands down It's Playoff time and they are 
playing like a welt · oiled mac hine. They have the 
perfect combinatIOn of Size and speed which 
a llows them to match up aga inst any opponenl 
C ourtslde observers are say ing Ihal AltItude 
Problem IS the only squad that has a c hance to 
sto p the stampe d e The darkhOrse squad has to 
be Ihe Phi DeItI They got ho t In Ihe flrsl round of 
the playoffs to earn a spot in the seml· finals, but 
can Ihey conlinue shoOllng 70%? 

T he AA over 500 IS by fa r the mo st balanc ed 
diVISion In the playoffs Anyone of Ihe 10 l eams 
still alive could win II. Look for Take" Inside 10 
play Ihelr brand of to ugh detense and gain a 
berlh In Ihe final s. Ihelr opponent may very well 
be the hard c harging " rnateln's Dream Team. 

In the AA under ,500 there IS no c laer cut pick 
Ih,s diVISion IS lull of real gym rats, the talent IS 
fairly balanc ed buI I have 10 give the edge to 
three teams. Jabbas. Fried Eggs and Small 
Tow.,.s seem to be the teams to beat, but 11 
should be a real shootout In the Rec Gym. 

The oddson favorlles In the A over 500 has to 
be Watson'. Booze Cr_. ThiS squad has expe-
IIence and the easlsst draw, but Dave and Matt 
have folded under thiS kind of pressure before . 
The loat Boys and Hope You lI"- Jammln' will 
be wailing for any turnovers by the Booze Crew 

In A under .500 it's anybody's guess It any 
team c an limit their turnover s to 20 per game 
they w ill have a gOOd sh ot, but endurance may 
bec ome a factor If the shooting c onl inues al a 
20% pace. Pick ing th is diviSion would be like 
IrYlng to pick scab football winners,

In the 1950s and 1960s, 
rock and roll traveling caravan 
shows were fairly common, 
Stars like Buddy Holly and 
Richie Val ens owed much of 
their success to these traveling 
s hows in which several bands 
would share the stage each 
night with other new and un-
heard of bands. 

In 1987, the Westwood One 
radio network and Coors Beer 
have collaborated to present 
the Four Play tour, a con-
temporary traveling caravan 
show featuring four of the 
most promiSing up-and-com-
ing bands. The show which 
will be fr ee to the public, 
features The Northern Pikes, 
Hurrah!. The Royal Court of 
China, and Will & the Kill, 
and will take these bands on a 
25 ci ty tour of clubs and col-
leges , including a stop at 
UCSD on Tuesday, Nov. 17 . 

The idea for the tour first 
originated with Creative Ar-
tists Agency (CAA), one of 
the nations leading talent agen-
cies. The plan was to have four 
major record companies each 
pick one of their most pro-
mis ing new artists to tour the 
country . T hen, by pooling 
their resources they could give 
these ba nds their firs t chance 

This tour is Four Play 
to experience a natio nal tour. 

As it stands, the bands will 
share o ne tour bus , one tour 
manager, and a small road 
crew. So that no group is 
labeled the "headliner," the 
bands will rotate the order of 
appearance each night; each 
set is kept to 35 minutes in 
length . Picking up the tab will 
be each of th record com-
panies , along with free radio 
time do nated by W(8twood 
One, and marketing items ~h 
as T-shirts will be given away 
free to the first 2Sll people at 
each show courtesy of Coors. 

Anothef co-spo r of the 
tour that will grearly batftt 
the bands is MTV. Tour pc:r-
formances and news will be 
featured on MTV's alternative 
music show, " 120 Minutes. It 
MTV is filming selected 
venu~. and is expected to be 
at UCSD on Tuesday night. 
The bands will also receive 
exposute fr o m the Four Play 
radio show that will air on 
stations across the country. 

As the Four Play to ur comes 
to the west coast , it will be 
stopping at UCSD next week, 
UCSD Pop Events is presen-
ting the show, wh ich will take 
place in the Recreational Gym 
on Tuesda y night at 8:00 pm. 
In preparatio n fo r the show, 
Pop Events d irector Frank 
Ya hr has scheduled a listening 

party tomo rrow nig ht in the 
Tri ton Pub at 7 p m, wh ich will 
be sponsored by KSDT. T he 
event will include the shOWing 
of videos by each participating 
band, as well as ticket and 
record give-a wayS, and Coors 
drink specials. A booth will 
also be ~t up in tbe Revelle 
Plaza which will feature the 
music of each of the bands, 
and more records and tickets 
will be given away, 

Though the event is entirely 
free, tickets will be required 
for entrance. The tickets will 

rmtde available from KSDT, 
the UCSD~dian, A¥Qrted 
Vinyl 91X~ t'Ck, a04l from 
the UCSD bpxoffice, through 
various promotional events, 
Yahr encourages everyone in-
terested in attending the shoW 
to come out to the listening 
party, the booth in Revell e 
today (Thursday) and Monday 
from 12-2 pm, or II ten to 
KSDT. 

The only non-North Amer-
ican band on the tour , Hurrah! 
is a promising quartet from 
the United Kingdo m. After 
years of limited exposure and 
very little response, the band 
has signed to Arista Records 
and has ' just released, " T ell 
God I'm Here." O n this album 
the band offe rs a great blend 
of guitar rock and ro ll and 
comes u p wi th a we ll ba lanced 

and enjoyable debut , 
Before the Four Play tour , 

H urrah! had never toured the 
U .S.. but auld be seen in 
Europe opening for bands such 
as U2. In a phone interview, 
lead si nger and gu itarist Paul 
Handyside expressed his eager-
neSi for the upcoming San 
Diego show by saving. " We're 
sur£bound." 

The Northern Pikes have 
been touring and recording in 
Canada for several years, and 
have recently been signed to 
Virgin Records. for whom they 
produced, " Big BlueSky." The 
album which contains the 
single, "The Things I Do For 
Money," is an excellent col-
lection of great rock and roll 
tunes rangi ng fro m slow me-
lodic songs to high-energy an-
th e ms . Co-found e r , bass 
player and singer Jay Semko. 
said that the Four Play tour 
"has been great for us, and 
we' re loo king forw ard to 
coming to San Diego ." 

Hailing from Nashville, Ten-
nessee, The Royal Court of 
C hina are promo ting their 
recent release on A & M Re-
cords, " The Royal Court of 
China." Proud of the fac t tha t 
they are a true guitar rock and 
roll band. unaided by sy nthe-
sizers or keyboards. "The 
Royal Court of Chi na" gets 
back to basics and comes out 

ahead . The album is fresh and 
b ri lliantly displays the talen t 
w ith in the group. Drummer 
C hris Mekow desc ribes the 
t our as ve ry successful and a 
g rea t experie nce. say in g, 
" W e're going to miss each 
o ther when it 's all over, we've 
gotten pretty close." 

From Austin, Texas, W ill 
&.. the Kill are one of MCA 
Records' most recent and pro-
mising young bands. Fronted 
by the 17 year-old Singer and 
guitarist W ill Sexron. (yes, 
h e's Charlie's brother ), the 
band pounds out raw and 
hard-d riven rock and roll. 
Kn own fo r their harmo nious

The Duck 's Breath MysrL'ry Th~arre tTaupe. 

Those zany ducks 
by mark kenney 

guardian intern 

They've been compared to 
"Monty Python'S Flying Cir-
cus." They've been called 
funnier than "Saturday Night 
Live." They're wacko, off the 
wall and unpredictable, and 
they smell something like 
minnows and garlic. 

They are, of course, Duck's 
Breath Mystery Theatre, the 
stars of radio and masters of 
live comedy performances. 
Founded in 1975 by five Uni-
versity of Iowa students -
Bill Allard, Dan Coffey, Leon 
Martell, Merle Kessler and Jim 

Turner - and based in San 
Francisco, the comedy troupe 
has been entertaining audien-
ces for a dozen years. Since 
their original performance in 
an Iowa bar (they can't re-
member whether they received 
free beer or five dollars), 
they've succeeded in selling 
out performances around the 
country. 

Duck's Breath's radio 
shows, which play regularly 
on nearly 200 National Public 
Radio stations, bring them 
even more exposure. Dr. 
Science (Dan Coffey) has 
gained a follOWing that borders 
on culthood. His somewhat 

inaccurate explanations of t'v -
eryday events include the se-
cret of ~ravity (Elmer's Glue 
All), and the truth behind 
Chihuahuas (cats with severe 
personality disorders). 

Other characters who ap-
pear in the Duck's live shows 
include Randee of the Red-
woods, a burnt out hippie, a 
member of the Transvestite 
Farmer's Association, and the 
soft-spoken mafioso Mr . 
Nifty. The Sensitive Male Hot-
line, Stump the Stallion, par-
odies of modern drama and 
the story of the Iowa Plains 
Ski Patrol, are also featured in 
their performances. 

Despite their zaniness and a 
style of humor that some say 
is of the "finger-up-the-nose" 
variety, Du.:k's Brearh Mystery 
Theatre is praised for its re-
lative cleanliness and its intel-
ligent variety of humor. Of 
the four troupe members who 
will appear at San Diego, 
Allard and Martell have mas-
ters' degrees in directing, and 
Coffey has a masters in playw-
riting. Turner was a sopho-
more at the University of Iowa 
when Duck's Breath formed. 

The Duck's successes con~ 
tinue. Dr. Science has become 
a Saturday morning TV show 
of Fox stations. Duck buttons, 
T-shirts, cassette tapes and 
even books are available. In 
addition, they've authored the 
currently unproduced screen-
play, Zarde, Cow from Hell, 
about an unfortunate bovine 
which has an encounter with a 
nuclear power plant. 

Duck's Breath Mystery Thea-
tre will be performing at Man-
deville Auditorium on Nov. 
13. Tickets are available 
through TicketMaster outlets 
or at the UCSD Box Office 
(534-4559).

A brutal cry· 

by ken calhoun 
hiatul staff writer 

When an occasional photo- . 
graph of the dead lying scat-
tered in the dusty streets of 
Soweto doesn't educate people 
to the realities of apartheid, 
leave it to film, drama and the 
moviemaker to really get the 
revolution rolling. Yes, a spoon-
ful of popcorn helps the medi-
.:ine go down. And, after seeing 
Richard Attenborough's.story 
of Steven Biko, in "Cry Free-
dom," I can't help but feel 
some shame upon learning that 
theatrics is what it takes to get 
me really fired up. 

With such a topic (Stephen 

Biko, and apartheid in gen-
eral), as well as the anger and 
frustration that the film gener-
ates, it's hard to look at "Cry 
Freedom" as a product of thea-
trics. But, the actual focus of 
the film (the relationship be-
tween Biko - played by St. 
Elsewhere's Denzel Washing-
ton - and newspaper editor 
Donald Woods - Kevin 
Kline) about two hours of its 
three hour length , bring the 
point to heart. 

During the first part of the 
film, one gets a hint of a story, 
a plot behind the horror . 
Woods, white liberal editor to 
a South African newspaper, 
runs a story condemning Biko 

Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline star in "Cry Freedom." 

and his "black conciousness" 
for being racist . It's Biko who, 
apparently after reading the 
article, invites Woods to find 
out what black South Africa is 
actually all about. The friend-
ship grows from there. 

As fast as their friendship 
develops, the oppression a-
gainst Biko and his movement 
rises to lethal proportions. In 
an almost choppy sequence of 
scenes, complete with typed 
captions of dates and events, 
we witness the fall of Bantu 
Stephen Biko. Biko is stopped 
on the road. Biko is arrested. 
Biko is imprisioned. 

A bruised and unconscious 
Biko is examined by a doctor, 
then Biko is dead. This comes 
so early in the film that I 
wondered not only what will 
happen in South Africa, but 
what will happen in this movie. 

What happens is a transfor-
mation . What once was a 
thoughtful docu -drama 
quickly becomes an escape 
movie, complete with the irri-
tating suspense builders seen 
in thousands of lesser films. In 
other words, it seemed that 
the film wanted to have a littlt: 
movie fun. 

With the rescue of the 
fleeing Woods family, the film 
is rescued from slipping too 
far into Hollywood and be-
yond real concerns. Atten-
borough slaps us in the face

A fatal film 
by nancy muntner 

hiatus staff writer 

The people who made 
"Fatal Beauty" probably 
thought that they had all of 
the ingredients for a big hit. 

They had Whoopi Goldberg; 
they had violence, and they 
addressed a current issue -
drugs. But this time around 
the formula just didn't work. 
"Fatal Beauty" missed irs mark

There is a stiU cenler of Eternity. A place where aU pasts, presents and futures meet. This intersecting point of knowledge and experience, pleuure and paiD. mortality and immortality has been described and referred to in a variety of dift'erent ways by 
mystics, prophets and teachers who have experienced it. 

Some have described it as God or Heaven. Others have referred to it as Nirvana or Tao. 
In Zen it is called Zen mind or Enlightenment. 

While names, descriptions and methods for reaching the still center of being vary 
greatly, the ultimate worth of this awareness is agreed upon by all who have shared it. The 
experience of the till center of being brings freedom, self-control, balance and power to 
those who have attuned their live to it. 

'Zen is the study of the Ten Thousand States of Mind and of Enlightenment, the still center 
whidllies beyond the Ten Thousand StaleS of Mind. It is a highly personal study wbidI brinp

completely; while it's supposed 
to be a comedy / adventure, it 
is in reality a humorless, pre-

The story is about narcotics

a bad batch of cocaine which 
can kill or drive you insane

Rizzoli is supposed to be

a stab at an Eddie Murphy

human - and although things 
fall on her a lot (like ceilings) 
and people always shoot at her 
with automatic weapons, she 
always emerges without a 
scratch . Thirdly, this formula 
character type is getting old. 
Eddie Murphy has used it up 
already. Rizzoli is merely an 
unfulfilling mimic of an over-
used character type. 

This movie, even with a 
trite lead character, could have 
had a chance if it just had one 
little thing - a coherent plot. 
There is, again, the skeletal 
story of drug dealers and their 
bad merchandise. But there 
are also numerous sub-plots 
that begin in the first half of 
the movie. and are never fol-
lowed up . ' 

For example, Rizzoli 's chief 
is a pro minent character for 
about 20 minutes of the film, 

threatening her with dire con-
sequences if she pursues the 
drug dealers on her own. Then, 
he disappears and we never 
see him again. This scene, along 
with other storylines, fades 
into nonexistence by the time 
we reach the end of the film . 

Violence becomes a substi-
tute for lack of plot in the 
movie. I soon lost track of 
how many people were killed . 
Everybody died in the same 
way, with their body riddled 
by bullets, and nobody was 
shot just once. Violence isn't 
bad if it's necessary for the 
plot, but in "Fatal Beauty," 
the violence became the plot. 

This movie was predictable 
from start to finish . The for-
mula is too worn out to carry a 
movie on its own . Hopefully, 
the mold will soon be thrown 
out. U ntil then, avoid movies 
like this one.

Murray and Dave 
by adam levy 
guardian intern 

The dynamic collaboration 
of jazz and dance offers a 
unique and exhilarating com-
bination of vibrant, rhythmic 
force, along with a poignant 
and innovative visual interpre-
tation. The relationship adds 
new dimensions to both art 
forms, for they work at high-
lighting and complimenting 
each other. 

The Dave Brubeck Quartet, 
in conjunction with the 
Murray Louis Dance Co ., 
should live up to this potential 
greatness. They will appear 
onstage together at the Spreck-
els Theatre, 121 Broadway, 
downtown San Diego, Nov. 

17-18 at 8 :00 pm. 
The combination has enjoy-

ed great success and have been 
touring together since 1984. 
Both Brubeck and Louis are 
known as leading innovators 
in their respective art forms 
and have won high critical 
acclaim. 

Brubeck, who plays the 
piano, has been a force in the 
jazz world for four decades, 
and yet has never stagnated in 
the creativity or quality of his 
work. He has been accredited

(or his innovative experimen-
tatio n in which he uses unor-
thodox time signatures and 
measures. His quartet first be-
ca me world renowned in the 
'50s and '60s, featuring the 
sleek playing of Paul Desmond 
on alto-sax. 

During his illustrious career, 
Brubeck has toured abroad 
for the State Department, per-
formed at the White House 
before five di fferent presi. 
dents, recorded "Time Out," 
the first gold record for 
modern jazz, rece ived the BM! 
pioneer award, and became a 
Duke Ellington Fellow at Yale 
UniverSity. 

Louis has also achieved great 

success for his dancing and 
choreography. As Loius him-
self puts it, "I seek to reveal , 
inspire, enlighten , disturb, mo-
tivate - to do something ne-
cessary to an audience that 
comes to have things done to 
them." As a result Louis' dance 
is characterized by a stylish 
mix of theatricality, panache 
and wit. 

He began dancing in 1949 
and was lead soloist with the 
Alwin Nikolais Dance Theatre 
until 1969. In addition to 
choreographing for his own 
company, Louis has created 
works for the Royal Danish 
Balle t, Paris Opera Ballet,Jose 
Limon and solo pieces for 

UCSD Department of Music 

Rudolph Nureyev. 
He has also recieved several 

prestigious awards including a 
Guggenheim Fellowhip, Grand 
Medaille de Vermeille de la 
ville de Paris and a Dance 
Magazine award. 

The two acts will be onstage 
together for the two shows, 
which feature a newly com-
missioned work in addition to 
the widely acclaimed Four Bru-
beck pieces. 

Tickets are $10, $20, $30 
and $37.s0 and are available
