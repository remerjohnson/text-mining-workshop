Republican presidentia l candidate Ronald 
Reagan - now President-elect - de troyed 
Jimmy Carter in ye terday' general election, 
ama ing one of the large t margin of victory 
over an incumbent pre ident in U hi tory. 

Reagan drew 463 electoral vot ,with a 
popular vote of 51 p rcent, to win a conte t 
many opinion poll had aid wa "dead even" 
ju t days before the election. 

In an address carried on n twork television 
last night, Reagan told . his support r, "I 
con ider the tru t you placed in me sa red. 

"I am not frightened by what lies ahead, and 
I don't think the American people are 
frightened," he continued. 

"Thank you, because if the trend continues, 
we may well control one house (of Congress) for 
the fi r t time in a quarter of a century," he 
aid. . 
And the trend Reagan hoped for did 

materia lize across the country, a Democratic 
stronghold in the Hou e and Senate were 
turned over to Republican challengers. 

Independent presidential candidate John 
Anderson collected only six percent of the 
nationwide vote, but that was enough to secure 
him $3 million in Federal Election Commission 
funds to cover his extensive campaign debts. 

Carter conceded defeat to Reagan one hour 
before polls closed on the West Coast. He wired 
Reagan at his home near Los Angeles, sending 
the mes age, "It is now apparent that the 
American people have chosen you a the next 
presiden t. ' 

In a press conference televised nationwide, 
Carter told viewers, "I promised you four years 
ago that I could never he to you , so I can't stand 
here tonight and say it doesn't hurt. 

"The people of the United States have made 
their choice, and of course I accept that 
deci ion , although not with the same 
enthus iasm I accepted it four years ago," 
Carter said. 

In hi concession speech , Anderson told a 
crowd of supporters that he "was not bruised 
in spirit or mind," and hinted that he may seek 
the presidency in 1984. 

In San Diego County, return on the 
presidential race ran along national lines, with 
the Reagan-Bush ticket drawing 60 percent of 
the popular vote. Carter drew 27 percent of the 
ballots cast while Anderson apparently picked 
up a few percentage points from both 
candidates, finishing with over nine percent of 
the vote. 

Pre ident Carter conceded Rea ..... ' vic· 
tory over an hour before CaUfornia' 
precinct even cJo.ed. 

Fonner California Gov. Ronald Reapn 
swept the presidential election last niPt. 

US Senate seat 
Overcoming an early vote deficit , 

Democratic incumbent Alan Cranston drew 54 
percent of the vote to defeat his opponent, 
Republican "tax crusader" Paul Gann , who 
picked up 39 percentage points. 

Three other third-party candidate garnered 
about six percent in the state, not affecting the . 
outcome of Cranston's battle to maintain his 
influential Senate seat. 

Political observers cited the importance of 
Cranston's victory for his party, noting that at 
least eight Democratic seats were turned over 
to Congressional Republicans in ye terday's 
election. 

Cranston supporters in San Diego - still 
angered by Carter's defeat - were cheered by 
Cranston's strong showing in the county. 

Cranston drew 55 percent of the California 
vote to Gann 's 39 percent.

California Gov. Jerry Brown said that ' the 
only good thing to happen tonight " was

Cal voters angered, 
biased by early polls 

• 

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
California voters, many of them already 

angered by TV news projections of President 
Carter's defeat before West Coast polls 
closed, cast ballots even after Carter's early 
concession yesterday. 

Carter had known even as he cast his own 
ballot earlier in the day that his White House 
days were probably numbered. 

Carte( discussed the situation early 
yesterday night in a telephone call across the 
White House to the office of press secretary 
Jody Powell, ~ho was h~rd to say,. "Mr. 
President, you d better walt a few mmutes 
more." He waited about two hours. 

Terry Pullan, campaign manager for 
Democrat Carey Peck in his uphill 
congressional race, said " the television 
networks and the wire services -should 
restrain themselves before releasing the 
projections. I'm not sure whether it made 
much of a difference in the presidential race 
but it may have had an impact on thou and 
of tate and local races across the country.

Refugee tragedy in 
a small Wise. town 
lfhere compassion turned to hate 

TOMAH. Wise. - Lene 
Cespedes Torre, the 20-year-
old cu ban refugee charged 
with murdering his 57-year-
old female American s~sor, 
sits alone in the Monroe 
County jail awaiting the next 
violent tum on his halting 
journey toward a new life. 

With no relatives in the 
United States. few friends, 
little english and no 
knowledge of American law, 
Lene Cespedes faces the 
prospect that that journey 
may end in life imprison· 
ment. Already it has led him, 
and others, through a 
dizzying maze in which the 
line between generosity and 
hypocrisy, compassion and 
hate, is so blurred as to be 
indefinable. 

The journey began in cuba, 
but the present chapter 
opened OIl the night of Sept. 
14, in this quiet rural 
Wisconsin town. 

. Berniece Taylor of Tomah, 
who three weeks earlier had 
liberated Lene from a tense 
refu,ee camp, was found at 
about 10:40 that · Sunday 
morning tiying in bed, fully 
clothed, with a pool of blood 
under her mouth, her head 
and neck covered with 
bruises. 

Mrs. Taylor's daughter: 
Theoda Evans, said she haa 
called t he house half an hour 
earlier. In a voice Evans 
described as "groay ," Lene 
Cespedes had said, in the few 

Julio Prato,. wrou tltis/or 1M 
Poci/ic News Service_ 

words of english he knows, 
"Mother sick." 

When police arrived at the 
house they found Lene in blue 
jeans but no shirt, showing 
deep scratches on his chest. A 
spot of his own blood was on 
the cover of his neatly made 
bed. There was no sign of a 
scuffle. 

With no relatives 
in the US and no 
knowledge of the 
law, Lene faces the 
prospect of life 
imprisonment 

In the basement, police 
found both Lene's and 
Berniece Taylor's blood-
spattered pajamas hidden in 
a carton. 

In stammering english, 
Lene told Theoda Evans 
several times that there had 
been two men in the house 
the night before. Evans' six-
year old nephew, Clayton 
Linenberg, who also spent 
the night in the house, said 
the same thing: two 
intruders. 

Then Captain Duane 
Owen of the Tomah police 
took Lene to headquarters. 
With two Border Patrol 
agents serving as inter-
preters, Lene waived his 
rights and gave a volun-
tary signed statement 
which so contradicted at 
least 12 other witnesses that 
the judge who heard it in 
court called it "preposter-

Th~ Ilaily Gum'dian 

ous." 
Lene insisted that he 

hadn't been out of the Taylor 
houseon the night of Sept. 13, 
but watched television with 
Berniece Taylor until 11 and 
then went to sleep. He said he 
was beaten unconscious 
while in bed. 

But Bobbi Steil, a 2O·year 
old girl from Kendall, 
Wisconsin, told police that 
Lene had come to visit her in 
the Tomah hospital where 
she worked at about 9:30 and 
again at about 11:30. 

David Verdeja borrego, 21, 
said he and Lene had then 
gone to two bars for beers 
(though Tomah Police Chief 
Don Fisher saidCespedes had 
not been drunk).According to 
witnesses, Lene went home 
at about 1:30. 

Since Mrs. Taylor died 
between 2:30 and 4:30, Lene's 
story did little to exonerate 
him, though it !>hattered ilis 
credibility. Chief Fisher 
commemdi: "We asked him 
several times if he wanted 
counsel-abogado in Span-
ish-but what does that mean 
to a Cuban? We don't know." 

Wednesday, November 5,1980 

'LEE IKo(CA)IM" US! I 
At the arraignment on Oct. 

'13, the court entered a plea of 
"not guilty" and set bail at 
$50,000. Said a local attorney 
who is close to the defense, 
"We like this case because 
it's a real who-dun-it." 

*** 

(VVe like this case 
because it's a real 
who-dun-it, ' said a 
local attorney who 
is close to the 
defense. 

Berniece Taylor was poor, 
too. In a town of immaculate 
white houses, hers is peeling 
and cluttered with junk, 
right by the railroad track!'. 
Her 71-year-old husband, 
from whom she had been 
separated since 1968, is a 
Sioux Indian , and her 
children are "dark." She was 
believed in Tomah to be 
collecting welfare, which 
compounded her pariah 
status. 

She knew the sting of 
social censure, to judge from 
the number of townspeople 
who felt free to call her 
"trash," even after her death. 

As a result, Taylor's 
murder did not ignite the 
tinderbox in Tomah. But 
when Lene Cespedes moved 
into the Taylor house, he 
unwittingly became every-
thing that a Tomah taxpayer 
amId hate. 

... 

Mrs. Taylor quickly 
developed a powerful 
attachment to the Cuban, 
who is a handsome, haunting 
mix of boy and man. She 
went to Fort McCoy to hound 
the voluntary refugee aid 
agencies to hasten the 
sponsorship. There was only 
a cursory investigation of 
him or her, though he had 
been in jail in Cuba. 

Later, in the preliminary 
hearings, Reserve Cjrcuit 
Judge Richard Orton asked 
Theoda Evans if her mother 
had "Fallen in love with

NEW YORK - "And 

now," said Betty, "I'm going 
to show you something you'll 

. really get a kick out of. A 
couple of years ago, 60 
Minules did a show on 
Bloominadale's, and we liked 
it so muCh we bought the tape 
and show it to our trainees. 
You'll love it." Dan Rather 
flashed on the video: he 
marched through the store, 
interviewing people in an 
effort to debunk what he 
referred to as "the myth of 
Bloomingdale's" -the myth 
being that Bloomingdale's is 
the largest, ritziest, most 
innovative, cultured depart-
ment store in the world . Or, 
as Rather put it, a Disneyland 
for adults. 

But he didn't succeed. The 
impression that one was left 
with, desp~e the fact that he 
interviewed people who were 
engaged in what might pass · 
for extreme narcissism in 
any other store or in the real 
world, was that Blooming-
dale's is the eighth wonder of 
the world-an honor also 
claimed by the Empire State 
Building. As a current 
employee of the store, I'd put 
my money on the Empire 
State Building. 

Bloomingdale's isn't like 
any other department store 
that I've been in-it's bigger. 
It sits on an entire city block 
and rise ten floors into 

Manhattan's sooty sky. The 
first time I went inside, I got 
hopelesslY lost in five 
minutes. Each floor is huge 
and is divided, Without 
apparent logic, into hundreds 
of circular counters and 
departments. Crowds surge 
throughout, sweeping the 
uncommitted or increasin~IY 
paranoically immobIle 
person along. And, with its 
florid black white and silver 
art-deco decor, the place looks 
like a set for a Busby 
Berkeley musical. 

It is especially grandiose 
now that it houses an 
t!normous exhibition of 
Chinese goods; its shopping 
bags lind numerous silms 
proclaim that it is the "dawn 
of a new era," with 
Bloomingdale's playing the 
Greek goddess. whose rosy 
fingers herald the sunrise. 

This is, of course, the view 
of someone visiting the store, 
someone not connected to it 
by the crisp green r.hain of 
monetary servitude. ·What I 
can't figure out is why, if Dan 
Rather wanted to debunk 
Bloomingdale's, he didn't 
interview any of its 
employees. Someone might 
have been willing to talk. But 
since no one had the chance, 
I'm going to bring to you 

-Bloomingdale's from the 
bottom up. 

I decided to get a part-t ime 
job within walking distance 
from my apartment, and 
Bloomingdale's fit the bill. 
One morning I arrived at the 
employment office, and found 
it filled with at lea t fifty 

dispirited, but extremely 
well-dressed people. Belore I 
was given an application I 
had to answer the first 
screening question: "Have 
you had a year's experience 
in a major department 
store?" 

I hadn't, but bluffed with 
what I hoped was skillful 
name dropping-"Brenlan-
o's in Beverly Hills." They'd 
figure that I was accustomed 
to dealing wi :h the over-
privileged, you . Soon I 

was interviewed by a loudly 
friendly young woman, who 
assumed that my lofty 
former connections and my 
brief stint in graduate school 
had prepare'd me for 
Bloomingdale's. As we 
parted, she dropped her jovial 
manner, stared hard into my 
eyes, and in a ringing voice 
said, "Work hard, Marcia. Do 
good!" 

Then I was in training, 
during which time I learned 
to operate the cash registers, 
write up sales, determine 
taxes and postage fees, and 
take checks-an ordeal not to 
be believed in New York, 
especially at Bloomingdale's. 
We were also shown a film 

Ul11~ Don"'t Steal, narrated 
by Kasey Kasem. Most of the 
occurences documented in 

.the film were discredited by a 
mem ber of the training group 
who was former security 
guard. 

Finally, we were given the 
Bloomingdale's dress code, 
which is barbaric by 
southern California stand-
ards. I was forbidden to wear 
boots, jean-style pants (even 
if velvet), halters, tube tops, 
sneakers, clogs, fitted shirts, 
tight pants, knit caps and 
costumes of national origin 
(the .last being so pooFly 
illustrated in the manual that 
I still don't understand what 
it means). I was encouraged 
to wear "appropriate 
undergarments. co-ordinated 
outfits, classic blazers and 
neat polished bu iness 
hoes " s . 
The foll,)wing day I began 

my career at the Kingfisher 
P.agoda, where I sell 
inexpensive Chinese jewelry, 
evenin~ bags and the 
enigmatiC kingfisher jewelry 
that gives the pagoda its 
name. And it Is this piece of 
merchandise which keeps me 
awake at nights, wondering. 
The puzzle is this: I sell stick 
pins, large brooches and hair 
ornaments that are made out 
of brass inlaid with the 
feathers of long - dead 
kingfisher birds. These 
ornaments are all over a 
hundred years old and 
formerly made up headdres-
ses for royal concubines. My 
question is this-why aren't 
they in a museum some-
where? Who thought of 
taking them apart and selling 
them in little pieces-the 
Chinese or the buyer for 
Bloomingdale's? As a friend 
of mine r~marked, "It's good 
Bloomingdale's didn't get 
hold of King Tut before the 
museums did." 

But there is something 
more that bothers me about 
the place. The people who 
shop at Bloomingdale's are 
often patronizing, demand-
ing and rude. They shout 
designer's names as if Oleg 
Cassini or Kenzo were 
running for state senate. 
Lack of familiarity with a 
Vuittoni for example, brings 
abuse upon the ignorant 
salesperson. The regular 
customers are occasionally 
outdone by the store's own 
personnel, whose purchases 
make up one-third of all

YOUR STUDENT 
ADVOCATE PROGRAM 

The Student Advocate Program is a student-run program 
designed to protect students and educate them regarding 
their rights within the University. The hope surrounding the 
Student Advocate Program is that students informed of their 
rights will be encouraged to exercise them. Through this 
exercise, rights are given life. If they ~e rarely used, they may 
be forgotten, and violations may become routine. 

The Student Advocate Program can work in many ways 
and -in all areas where students's rights are threatened or 
violated. Sometimes all that is needed is advice on how to 
solve a problem, or a referral. Other times the Commissioner 
of Student Welfare will work collectively with other 
advocates and the student to find the best solution to fit the 
individual's needs. 

The undertying issue is the right to control your own life. 
The only way students will get their rights and a significant 
voice in their schools and communities will be through 
organizing. Only determined, well -organized students can 
radically change things to their advantage and address issues 
such as sexism, racism, harassment by police, and academic 
and administrative grievances. Through the Student 
Advocate Program students can work to take control of their 
own INes, and better help themselves and others by 
distilling the experience, knowledge and resources available 
into one easily accesible entity. 

The Student Advocates ~e concerned students 
interested in helping other students. Without your 
participation, this is not possible. Gaining control of your 
own life, passing your learning process on to other students 
and organizing are the guts of an education, even though the 
University doesn't want to admit it. Without involvement 
there can be no progress. Students interested in being 
Student Advocates should contact Reggie Williams at 452-
4450.

Later he called and said he wanted tic.

he was entertaining the Chargers. It's 
things like that that can give you an 
ulcer." 
. They can get taken advantage of when 
It comes to money, too. They don't 
always get paid on time, and have 
sometimes had trouble getting paid at all. 

The money they do collect isn't a lot, 
Ganz says. "We made $10,000 in six 
months, but that's not much when it's 
divided between us." 

They don't let the dimmer aspects 
bother them, says Helm. who sees PURL 
as "a learning experience." 
. "The fame trip isn't what we're all 
mto," he adds. "We're like one big family 
and we enjoy what we're doing. We have 
a ball." 

But if ~ame. isn't their goal, it does 
cross their mmds. Ganz has been in 
con~act with 20th Century Fox, through 
a fnend who works there, and is hoping 
he can §et a tape of the band into the right 
hands 'on the off-chance that we'll get a 
record out of it." 

And Helm believes that "our music 
will. take us there. Right now, we're 
paymg dues. That s when a musician has 
been playing for 35 years and is known to 
no one and all of a sudden he's on an 
album that everyone knows about 
That' paying dues." . 

Dougla ' optimism is less contained , 
"We plan to make it big by 1981," he 
sar.ings, enjoying the hype. 

'The act will be together and we're 
going to take it all the way." 

'Day on 
the Hump' 

Dozens of UCSD 
students who double as 
entertainers with the 
AS to produce an event 
one of them is billing as 
a "Day on the Hump." 

Organized by Larry 
Sweeney with the help 
of AS Programming 
Commissioner Joshua 
Harris, six bands and 
dancers, poets and 
comedians are contri-
buting their talents free 
to the 12-hour event. 

"The idea is to get 
them out in front of the 
student body to show 
what they can do," 
Sweeney, says. 

They II be doin~ it 
from noon to midn~ht 
Friday, with a wide 
array of music presen-
ted. 

During the TGIF 
(free beer provided by 
the AS), the jazz fusion 
band Matrix will play. 
At five, as the beer 
starts to run out 
"commercial punk': 
36T takes the stage. 

Other musicians 
include the folk group 
Driftwood at noon, a 
classical brass quintet 
at 2, a "contemporary 
rock" show by Tropl-
cana Zero and the heavy 
metal band Hologram at 
10 pm. 

The Douglass Dance 
Ensemble, which des-
cribes itself as modem 
jazz dance, will dance 
for an hour starting at 7 
pm and, among its 
numbers, will do a 
dance from the movie 
Fame. 

In between the 
musical acts, poetry 
readings, comedians 
and dancers will fill 
time, and electronic 
music tapes will play 
during equipment 
changes. 

All the bands and acts 
will be composed of 
UCSD students.

his passion for Beethoven

performs three Beethoven 
sonatas in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

interpret classical music as 
well as jazz. He was awarded 
a Fwbnght grant last year to 
teach American music at the 
University of Keele, England. 
While in Europe, Lytle 
presented concerts in 
London's famous Purcell 
Room and other English 
music centers, the conserva· 
tory of music and art in 
Aarhaus, Denmark, and the 
John F. Kennedy Center, 
Washington, D.C. upon his 
return . 

In addition, he participated 
in a number of . radio 
broadcasts with members of 
the Danish State Radio Jazz 
Orchestra. 

Though the emotional 
quality of the first movement 
of the "Moonlight Sonata" 
("Sonata No. 14 in C·Sharp 
Minor, Op. 27") has been 
made to represent the entire 
sonata in the popular mind, 
to Beethoven It served as a 
means to an end. That is, to 
give continuity in unbroken 
flow to the whole sonata, a 
flow that was impeded by 

havi~ the slow movement in 
the middle. Sonata 14 is an 
example of how well the 
oompoeer sucx:eeded with his 
~ment. 

Tickets are $1 and ~ 
towards a music scholarship 
open to graduates and 
undergraduates. 

Planiat Cecil Lytle performs Beethoven. 

'Sonata No. 32 in C Minor 
(Op. 111)" ~ts the 
epitome of Heethoven's 
sonatas in regard to its 
composition, the artists 
technique as a pianist and his 
philosophy about the 
pianoforte as an instrument. 

"Sonata No. 27 in E Minor, 
Op. 90," a rare work written 
during five rather unproduc· 
tive years (1812·1g17), a 
superb experiment in 
Romantic style, firmly 
establishes Beethoven's 
melodic genius. 

Lytle is noted for his 
exceptional ability to

When they sat down and 
invented the game of hockey, 
they certainly didn 't have 
members of the female gender 
in mind . I mean really. 
There's no way a woman 
could po sibly ma ter the 
intricate kills of stickhand· 
ling and shooting the puck, let 
alone have the endurance and 
physical toughness that it 
takes to negotiate one' elf 
around the rink . some 200 
times an hour, True 
Statement, right? 

Dead wrong .... and the facts 
are right here to prove. 
UCSD's rapidly expanding 
1M Coed Floor Hockey 
Proeram i an immediate 
indictment. 

Six leagues and 32 teams 
are currently in full sWing. 
And we do mean swing. 
There's been enough 
slapshots taken this fall to 
make theRecGym resemble a 
wind tunnel. 

And much of the swinging 
has come from the distaff 
side. In AAA, a number of 
comely lovelies ' have been 
firing at will on some of the 
best men goalkeepers on 
campus. And they've been 
successful too. Mary Travers 
and Barbara Murphy ofis It A 
Penalty To Cum In The 
Crease? have been lighting 
the nets up regularly. Well 
enough to give ISAP a 3-1 
season log and 2nd place in 
the tough Islander League. 

And then there's Iris Tone 
and Carla Irvine of Broads 
Treat Bullies who have'been 
carrying the Liotta Bros. 
franchise around on their 
backs all season. The Bullies 
also sport a 3-1 record and 
should fight it out with ISAP 
for the runnerup spot on the 
Islander League. 

First place in that league? 
Forget it. It 's been reserved 
for the past month since this 
team decided to get together. 
Let's face it, Manchester 
Punk UnItd. is loaded . 
They're the Yankees of 1M 
Floor Hockey. The best team 
money can buy. Not only do 
they have the best ladies in 
the game in Terri Gore, Lau ri 
Robson, and Kay Melchor, 
they've a&o got an all·star 
front line of Robert Akaski 
and Greg Angelo. And then 
their third string fine of Chris 
Armour and Joe Davis could 
probably play for the LA 
Kings. No wonder they're 4·0 
and yet to be tested. 

The AA Division hs been no 
less competitive or exciting. 
TO THE MAX seems to have 
been playing that way all 
season as their unblemished 
4·0 illustrates. Even more 
impressive wa their 4·3 
thrashing of last year's A 
Champion, Fobo, in a hotly 
contested skirmish last 
Tuesday. Even All·World 

• I r 
... presents Intramural Sports Shorts 

Defen eman Kenn (Enos) 
Buckley couldn't stop the 
steady flow of Max 's goals. 
Rumor has it that Buckley 
may be going back to his real 
love, lacrosse, once the 
hockey ea on'concludes. 

Knocking on the door to No. 
I i a host of 2·1 teams that 
ought to be locked upon a zoo, 
arboretum or garbage 
di po al.. .take your pick. 

Penguins in Bondage, 
Ambose Orchid Pumpini, 
and Chunk Pineapple are all 
talented squads with bizarre 
sounding heritages. 

In the A Division the 
championship is still up for 
grabs, even though the field 
has been narrowed to two 
teams. The rest of the pack 
has been masquerading as 
Coed A Hockey team 
consistently, which is exactly 
what they are. The two 
imposters, Lucky Puckers 
and Kings & Queens, are both 
3·0, both strong on offerise (28 
and 24 goals respectively) and 
both waiting to be challenged. 

1M hockey concludes its 
season Saturday, November 
22 with play-offs scheduled 
for the week of Thanksgiv· 
ing, Nov. 24·26. 

ALL-CAMPUS TENNIS 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 

When it comes to athletic 
competition, you would 
normally think that seniors 
would have an edge on 
freshmen. You know ... more 
s kill, more experience, 
st ronger , wi se r .. . better 
looking. Hal So much for that 
theory. Witne s the following 
series of events. 

Let's take Exhibit A. 
That's A as in the Men's A 
Tennis Championships Ihat 
ju t concluded last Sunday. 
Eugene Jone, a freshman 
engineering major from PI. 
Loma survived four prelimin· 
ary rounds enroute to 
resounding 6-1 , 6·4 victory 
over senior Andy Nahas to 
capture to Men' Singles 
Championships. Interesting· 
Iy enough, Jones' father Gil, 
won this same tournament 
two years ago when attending 
UCSD as a graduate student. 

Now Exhibit B ... as in the 
Men's B Championships. The 
winner ... you guessed it. Ninh 
Choung, a freshman from 
Vietnam defeated veteran 1M 
tennis player Keith Guinn 6-
2, 7·6 in climactic, hard· 
fought final. 

Ready for Exhibit C. 
You've got it. The winner of 
the Women's C Champion· 
ships was none other than 
Deidre Y08St a 7·5, 7·5 winner 
over Mary Beth Lambert. 
Yes, Deidre is also a 
freshman. 

Want more. Okay . In the 
Women's B Division, Jean 
Ann Crock out·gasped 
Susanne Neumann in a 7·6 7· 
6 thriller. And yep, you 

gues sed H ... Crock is a 
freshman right? Wrong. Jean 
Ann is a Senior P ychology 
major from San Diego. 
However, Neumann is. And 
she came ,all the way from 
Wisconsin to play in this 
tournament. 

All in all, it was a rather 
impressive display of tennis 
by the youth of America. And 
it was obvious that they had 
little respect for their elder .

rate increases, the Public 
Utilities Commission ordered 
Pacific Telephone yesterday 
to undertake a management 
audit by an independent 
auditing firm . 

The PUC 's executive 
director and staff would 
establish areas of study and 
develop plans for selecting 
the consultants. 

Pacific Telephone now has 
on file a request for a rate 
increase of $794 million 
annually. 

PUC President John 
Bryson said the cost of such 
an audit has been estimated 
at $3.5 million. 

But he said in view of $3.5 
billion i.n annual operating 
and mamtenance costs and 
planned construction 
expeditures of about $14 
billion over the next five 
years, such an audit mi~ht 
provide information leadIng 
to cost reductions and would 
be worth its cost. 

The audit would be in two 
~ases. First the consulting 
firm would study top 
management practices of the 
utility, including the role of 
the parent company, 
American Telephone and 
Telegraph. 

In the second phase, 
specific operations would be 
reviewed to identify 
additional cost reduction.

Reagan wins by a landslide; 
local voters defeat Metzger 
continued from page 9 
Daily Guardian that he and 
other "radical" candidates 
were taken off California 
ballots at the last minute. 

Friedman relied on write-
in votes for his support. At 
press time, the county 
Registrar of Voters could not 
provide Friedman with an 
exact tally of his vote, but is 
was estimated that of all the 
votes cast in the 43rd 
District, less than one one-
hundredth were cast for him. 

In other local races, the so· 
called "coattail effect" swept 
Repu blicans into many 
Congressional and tate 
legi lature eats. 

Despite his heavy 10 8 at the polls, Independent 
... esidential candidate John Ander on received enough 
vote8 to win federal funding to help cover his campaign 
debts. 

Bill Lowrey, Republican 
candidate in the 41 t 
Congre ional District, 
handily defeated Democratic 
opponent Bob Wilson. 

Anderson wins funds 
despite campaign loss 

While speaking to reo 
porters last night at Election 
Central, Wilson commented 
that the pre ident's 
conces ion over an hour 
before ,the polls closed in 
California low.ered Democra-
tic voter turnout in hi 
district and allowed Lowrey 
to pull ahead with 52 percent 
of the vote. 

Althou~h he suffered 
defeat In yesterday's 
presidential election, 
Independent candidate John 
Anderson was still able to 
gamer about six percent of 
the nationwide popular vote, 
qualifying him for nearly $3 
million in federal funds to 
cover his campaign debts. 

In California, approxi-
mately eight percent of the 
voters went for Anderson. 

Anderson ran strongest in 
the New England states, 
where he polled over 10 
percent. He received 14 
percent in both Massachu-
setts and Vermont. 

Political observers said 
before the election that 
Anderson's campaign would 
be hurt by a paradox. They

explained that if interested 
voters did support Anderson, 
he would have a chance of 
winning. Yet voters would 
not support him unless they 
thought he could win. 

As Michael Bleiweiss, 
Anderson campaign worker 
and recent UCSD graduate, 
explained, "People didn't 
believe he could win, so they 
dic\n't vote for him." 

In his concession speech, 
Anderson appeared confident 
and at ease. Recalling a 
statement made by Abraham 
Lincoln, he asserted, "Well of 
course I'm disappointed. But 
I'm not bruised in spirit or 
mind." 

He states that the returns 
showed he was not to be the

Wilson drew 44 percent of

Republican challenger 
Duncan Hunter upset 
incumbent Lionel Van 
Deerlin for the 42nd 
Congressional seat. Hunter's 
54 percent was enough to 
remove the nine -term

Kapiloff gathered 56 percent 
of the vote to Tharp's 44

was marred by an excess of 
mudslinging. 
State and local measures 

California voters approved 
eight of the 11 propositions 
set before them on the state 
ballot. Notable among the 
propositions that were 
defeated was Proposition 10. 

That initiative would have 
established separate smoking 

and non-smoking areas in 
private - as well as public -
places of work and business. 
A solid 56 percent of San 
Diego voters voted against 
the measure. 

San Diego County voters 
soundly defeated Proposi tion
