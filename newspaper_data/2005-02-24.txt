Staff Writer 

Campus administrarors have 
ordered investigations into the 
legality of a Student-Run Television 
broadcast of a video showing sexual 
acts performed by KDaIo Editor and 
AS. Elections Manager Steve York. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Carmen Vazquez will 
spearhead the inquiries, at the 
request of Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. 
Watson. Last week, Vazquez asked 
campus counsel to examine if the 
broadcast abided by policies with-

Communications Commission 
regulations and campus policies, 
she said. Vazquez said she expects 
to have answers from the attorney 
as early as this week. 

Until the investigation is com-
pleted, no further action will be 
taken, Watson said. 

"We want to do this objective-
ly," he said. "Once we have all the 
facts, then we will know what to 
do from there." 

The Feb. 3 "Koala TV" broad-
cast on SRTV included acts of oral 
sex and ejaculation by York, a John 
Muir College senior, and an 

unidentified woman . 
The Koala, a con trover ial cam-

pus publication, has previously 
clashed with university officials 
over its content. 

"While we were hesitant to 
welcome the Koala when they 
approached us last quarter about 
having their own show, SRTV 
could not discriminate [against) 
them for their past behavior," sta-
tion manager Chelsea Welch stat-
ed in a Feb. 22 e-mail ent out to 
the student body. "When it comes 
to students' shows, [ have to stay 
content-neutral. " 

[n an e-mail to the Guardian, 
York stated that his broadcast was 
meant to support free speech 
rights and that he invites any chal-
lenge from the school administra-
tion. 

"['ve been put into a po ition to 
advocate for free speech issues and 
it's great that the tool for them has 
been my penis," he tated. 

As a closed-circuit station, 
SRTV is not bound by FCC oper-
ating regulations. York's broadcast 
was in accordance with SRTV 
standards, according to Welch.

rights may be broadcast between

Study: UC service workers underpaid 
By MARNETTE FEDERIS 

Senior Staff Writer 

Service workers within the 
University of California earn 15 
ptrcent less than their California 
State University counterparts and as 
much as 26 percent less than those 
in community colleges, according 
to a new tudy -from the National 
Economic Development and Law 
Center released in February. 

EDLC released the snldy in 
the midst of contract negotiations 
between the university and the 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
Local 3299, which represents UC 
service workers. The study was 
commissioned by the union. 

Talks between the two have cur-
rently reached an impasse and 
workers are scheduled to vote on a 
suike in March. Among the issues 
up for debate include increases in 

wages and health benefits. 
The study concludes that 

salaries of UC service workers are 
low enough to qualify them for nine 
welfare benefit programs. It com-
pared the current wages of UC ser-
vice workers to a "self-sufficiency 
standard," defined as the amount of 
earnings needed to cover the basic 
necessities to live in a given area. 

"UC cannot control the cost of 
living in California, only what it can 
offer in terms of salaries and bene-
fits within available resources," the 
UC Office of the President stated 
in a written response to the find-
ings. "We are commitTed to paying 
our employees market-competitive 
salaries and benefits, provided we 
have the resources to do so." 

The self-sufficiency level varies 
depending on the county and com-
pares a family's income to its cost of 
living. NEDLC then compared 
wage ranges to those at CSU and

UCOP believes that the analy-

salaries, according to the universi-
ty's statement. 

"We use a methodology that is 
pretty straightforward," NEDLC 
Senior Program Specialist Aimee

Guardian editors approve 
changes to constitution 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

Staff Writer 

In an effort to streamline publi-
ca tion, editor of the Guardian have 
approved change to the paper' con-
stitution, including the addition of a 
Business Oversight Committee. 

The Guard,oll Executive Board 
voted 17-0-0 in favor of the amend-
ments at a Feb. 21 meeting. Voting 
members included all edit rs and the 
paper's business manager, a universi-
ty career employee. Among other 
duties, the board is vested by the 
paper's constitution with authority 
to set paper operating policies. 

"The reasons behind the 
changes are to make the goals of 
the editorial and business as one," 
Editor in Chief Clayton Worfolk 
said. "Changes such as the Business 
Over ight Committee arc the first 
step toward doing that." 

The COtTUnittee will provide "offi-
cial oversight, supervision and gover-
nance of the business deparunent," 
according to the new amendments. 
Virtually every business aspect will be 
supervised by the committee, includ-
ing ratifying the newspapers annual 
budget, determining the size and 
structure of the business department 
and working with the business man-
ager to set advertising sales goals. 

Approved amendments to the 
constitution set the membership of 
the Business Oversight Committee 
to include the Guardian editor in 
chief, managing editors, business 
manager and an administrator from 
the universitys Student Life business 
office. The editOr in chief may al 0 
move to add members to the com-
mittee with approval by a majority 
vote of the Executive Board. 

The changes also removed the 
business manager from the 
Executive Board. 

Previously, the business manag-
er alone was responsible for making 
staff employment decisions as well 
as handling advertising administra-
tion. Both of those tasks will be 
shared with the Business Oversight 
Committee under the updated con-
stitution . All voting members on 
the committee will be students, 
except the business manager. 

The structure of the committee 
could be successful, according to 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson. While student-
operated and self-supporting, the 
paper is an administrative unit 
within Watsons deparnnent. 

"Businesses should be very much 
a learning experience for students, 
so they're never going to run as effi-
ciently as nonstudent-run business-
es, but that's not saying all nonstu-
dent-run businesses run very well," 
he said. "But I think in the experi-
ence of UCSD, situations allowing 
students to be involved with busi-
ness sides [have) served as a good 
learning experience and allowed the 
business to function quite effective-
ly in terms of providing a service 
and remaining financially viable. It's 
my hope that the GUIIT'dill1l is able to 

achieve both." 
Changes ro the Glllmllllll finan-

cial structure were suggested 111 the 
hope of boosting ailing ~inal1l:es. 
which have forced the newspaper to 
puhlish smaller is ues, Worfolk ~aid . 

"The new paper has dropped in 
page numbers as a renection of our 
budget," he sa id . " \ Ve hope that In 
entity su h as the Busines Over~ight 
CommitTee will allow us to 111.1:'\.1-
rnize what we want this paper to be." 

ccording to it annual tinancial 
. reports, revenue of the new paper 
have dropped over the past four 
years, cau ing it to lose almost 
$60,000 last year. 

The Guardian is funded by 3llver-
tising, which students often'misun-
derstand, according ro Advertising 
Director Michael Foulks, a uni"ersi-
ty career employee. 

"We receive no aid from .S. or 
the university," he said. 

In order to maintain :I fisC'JII}, sus-
tainable balance of content, the pub-
lication has created a 50-percent split 
between advertising and editorial 
space, Foulks said. However, due to 
heavy advertising competition from 
other bodies, the Guordial1 has suf-
fered financial los es, which has cre-
ated less room for editorial content. 

"An ideal situation would be with 
the Guordioll being the show and 
being all there is," Foulks sa id. "But 
with every week, it seem that there 
are more and more entities where 
people on campus and merchant 
can direct their advertising money." 

While revenues have been 
deciining, the ituation is hopeful , 
Foulks sa id. 

"I've been around this place for a 
while and things usually ebb and 
flow," he sa id. "The economy always 
goes up and down, which kind of 
reflects the new paper .... Now we'rc 
in a uit of a down period." 

However, a lack of cOlTunun ica-
cion has posed a problem for the 
paper, said As istant BUSlIlcss 
Manager Emilee Schumer, a studcnt. 

"The financial side and editorial 
side of the Gllfmlitm have been very 
separate," she said. "Operating that 
way has not been very heneficial. " 

Although the new Busines~ 
Oversight Committee will serve ;15 a 
conduit between the student-run 
editorial and mostly adult-operated 
business parts of the paper, the areas 
will remain divided, Worfolk said. 

"Now there will be a line of 
connection between the goals of 
the Executive Board and business 
staff," he said. "There has always 
been a wall between the two, and 
we realize now that the two need to 
be interrelated. This board is a uni -
fying element, but we recogni ze 
that the wall between the two sides 
is still important." 

The new policies require the 
committee to communicate regularly 
with the Executive Board and "alert 
the board to all unexpected changes 
to the fiscal health of the paper."

I BRIEFLY 
Scripps researchers find 

evidence of warming 
Scientists at the Scripps Institution of 

Oceanography say they have found the first 
clear evidence linking human activity to 
changes in the Earth's climate. In a joint study 
with colleagues at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, researchers have found 
data showing a rise in temperature in the 
world's oceans. 

"This is perhaps the most compelling evi-
dence yet that global warming is happening 
right now, and it shows that we can successfuf-
Iy simulate its past and likely future evolution," 
Scripps research marine physicist Tim Barnett 
said. 'The statistical significance of these results 
is far too strong to be merely dismissed and 
should wipe out much of the uncertainty about 
the reality of global warming:' 

The new research used a combination of 
computer models and real-world data to detect 
signals of the penetration of greenhouse gas-
Induced warming in the oceans. The study, its 
authors state, is clear evidence that the warm-
ing was caused anthropogenically - through 
human activity. 

Critics have previously discredited other 
computer models purporting to establish the 
same Information by showing that they failed 
to make accurate long-term predictions. 

The mechanisms revealed in the ocean 
study will also produce broad changes across 
the atmosphere and land, Barnett said. 

Academic Senate looking 
for 'distinguished' teachers 

The Academic Senate has announced a 
search to honor the campus' most extraordi-
nary teachers. 

It is soliciting nominations for the senate's 
annual Distinguished Teaching Award. The honor 
targets "a select number of faculty and graduate 
students who have made extraordinary contribu-
tions to UCSD as distinguished teachers.' 

Students can submit their nominations to 
chairs of the specific academic departments by 
March 15. A reception in spring quarter will 
honor the winners. 

GSA named 'Graduate 
Association of the Year' 
UCSD's Graduate Student Association - a 

governmental body representing the campus' 
graduate student population - has been 
named this year's recipien.t of the. UC Students 
AsSOCiation's Graduate Student ASSOCIation of 
the Year award. 

The UCSA, which represents all 200,000 
students at nine UC campuses, offiCially pre-
sented the award at a Feb. 5 banquet held at 
UC Davis. 

UCSD's GSA was chosen for its work 
"across the UC system defending students' 
rights, specifically with regard to student-fund-
ed facilities and campus-based fees," according 
to UCSA Organizing Director Matthew 
McFeeley. 

'The GSA at UCSD took a leadership role 
when campus administrators first attacked the 
student co-ops' rights to student-fu nded 
space," McFeeley stated in a UCSA press 
release. "They have used this work as a spring-
board to defend students' rights to free speech 
and student spaces across the UC system~ 

Study: Newer generations 
slow to curl) drinking' 

Though people consume fewer alcoholic 
beverages as they age, people born in more 
recent years show a slower decline than those 
born earlier, according to a new UCLA study. 

To be published in the March issue of 
American Journal of Public Health, the study 
includes concrete data that backs a pattern 
health experts had suspected but never 
proven, according to UCLA associate professor 
of medicine Alison Moore. Moore served as the 
lead researcher in the project. 

People born in 1925 saw their drinking fall 
an average of 11 percent in each decade of 
their life while those born 10 years later posted 
only a 9-percent decline, the study found. 

'We confirmed that with increased age, 
people do drink less," Moore stated in a uni-
versity announcement. "The kicker is that, over 
time, the earlier group had a faster decline.' . 

Some hypotheses may be able to expl~ln 
the difference between age ~roups, she said. 
For example, earlier generations could have 
simply started out with higher levels of alcohol 
consumption. 

UC launches new postprint 
distribution service 

The University of California has introduced a 
new service that will allow scholars to pubhsh 
postprints - peer-reviewed articles previously 
printed in academic joumals. 

The service will also allow the general pub-
lic free access to a repository of the research, 
which will be included on a searchable onl ine 
database. However, the service will only feature 
work of UC faculty who have retained the nec-
essary copyrights or who obtain permission 
from their publishers to disseminate the 
reprinted works.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting .22 - Feb. 23, 2005 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item D 

The council passed a referendum asking 
students to vote on a 53 increase in the 
Student Activity Fee to pay for student-ini-
tiated outreach. 

Council Caucus 
The council discussed the broadcast of 

pornography on SRTV. Many members of 
the council said they supported the free 
speech exhibited in the broadcast, but thought 
that a forum for grievances should be estab-
Hshed. According to station manager Chelsea 
Welch, 57 percent of more than 200 students 
who contacted the station did not object to 
the progranuning. Revelle College Senior 
Senator Ted McCombs said that students who 

were offended by the broadcast could receive 
a refund for the portion of their srudent fees 
that aUocated to the Koala or SRTY. 

Old Business 
Item B 

The council discussed changes to the 
current A.S. representation structure pro-
posed by McCombs. His proposal would 
give voting powers to the six council chairs 
as well as A.S. commissioners and the exec-
utive board . In addition, the 24 senators on 
the council would become nonvoting mem-
bers. Citing the need for further discussion, 
counci lm embers have until 4 p.m. on Feb. 
25 to vote.

income to sustain families with two working 
parents and two children, and more than a 
third of workers earn wages that fall below 
self-sufficiency for single adults, according 
to the study. 

The study also reported that UC senior 
custodians earn a minimum hourly wage of 
$10.06 and a maximum hourly wage of 
$13 .02. The numbers compare to a CSU 
minimum wage of 511 .86 and a maximum of 
$15 .40. Community college custodians earn 
up to 513.82 as a minimum hourly wage and 
$17 .61 as a maximum. 

At UCSD, the srudy found that 58 per-
cent of single adults and 99 percent of single 
parents with a preschooler earn less than the 
self-sufficiency standard. 

"Many UCSD workers already knew that 
their counterparts at SDSU, K-12 and com-
munity colleges earn more for doing the 
same work, but this report makes these find -
ings formal and public," AFSCME local 
organizer Jessica Lopez stated in an e-mail. 
"The overall consensus among workers is 
that it 's about time somebody aired UC's 
dirty laundry." 

Lopez said that wages for service workers 
have been sugnant for the past 15 years 
while the cost of living has continued to rise. 

"UC has undertaken several measures to 
help recognize all employees - represented 
and unrepresented alike - given disappoint-
ing state funding for salary increases," the 
university stated in response to the study. 

The NEDLC snldy coincides with the 
release of another fact-finding report by a 
state-appointed arbitrator designed to assist 

in talks between a separate clerical workers' 
union and the university. 

The report suggested that $20 million in 
nonstate money originally intended for cler-
ical wage increases was "reabsorbed into 
other projects, such as expanding dormito-
ries and parking facilities, or other activities 
related to the university'S academic mission." 

The Clerical University Employees 
union, which represents 16,000 clerical 
workers on nine UC campuses, has been in 
negotiations with the university since July 
2003 . A state-appointed arbitrator was 
hired after talks between the university and 
C.U.E. stalled. 

However, a written response issued by 
UCOP states that C.U.E. has misrepresented 
and mischaracterized the report's findings. 

The university stated that salaries are 
continuous expenditures, requiring long-
term funding, and are not based exclusively 
on one-time appropriations. 

UCOP has also criticized C .U.E. for 
bad-faith bargaining, suggesting that the 
union violated a confidenti ality provision 
after the report was relea ed to both parties. 

The university has submi tted a letter to 
request an investigation into the matter. 

In response to the srudies, the university 
1las pointed to the recent state budget crisis as 
the cause of stagnant salaries. 

However, only 19 percent of the UC 
budget comes from the state, while the CSU 
system receives 72 percent from the state, 
according to the NEDLC report.

10 p.m. and 6 a.m., she said. 
However, the tation's charter 
requires that the content offer an 
"a rtistic medium within the context 
of FCC rules and regulations gov-
erning on-air coneluct and the 
operation of a closed-circuit televi-
ion station." 

S RTV is funded bv self-assessed 
;mdent actlviry fees ' :lllocared by 
Associated Snldents. As ofln~r week, 
A .. Presidcnr Jenn Pac saId she hau 
nOl heard any smclelll complaints 
a bout York's bro~dcast. 

Since the ration is completely 
studcnt-run, an\ UCSD snldent has 
the right to produce his ur her uwn 
material if unsatisfied with the use of 
sruuent fees, A. . C011lmissioner of 
Srudent ervices Kian ,\1aleki said. 

" I r ccrtain groups of people 
aren't happy with the content that 
IS being aired, they arc free to 
atte nd RTV meerings at 9 p.m. on 
\Vcdnesdays and produce their 
own," he said. 

Under UC-,viJe administrative 
policies, student governments must 
provide financial suppott for snldent 
activities and organizations "on a 
viewpoint-neutral basis." 

However, the same ection in the 
regulations allows the chancellor of 
each C;llnpus [0 "discontlnue recog-
nition of srudent govcnunental enti-
ties as official rudent governments." 

Though no deci ion on action 
has been made, th e connections 
between Associated Students and the 
Know, as well as York's latest "Koala 
TV" broadcast, have exposed a 
problem thaI has dIsmayed the 
administration, \Nabon said. 

"This is a matter for the students 
to address, but [ would be less than 
honcst if I did not exprc.· my disap-
poinonent in such an approach to 
things by A.S.," he said ... , think we 

have great concerns with the editor 
of the Koala being appointed A.S. 
elections manager. I view it as the 
A.S. endor ing the Koala and what it 
has done and srands for." 

Pae said York 's work with the 
A.S. Counci l is completely separate 
from his ther activities. 

, Although Steve York has mul-
tiple roles on camplI , it has been 
madc deur that his role on A..S. 
should he 1:lken seriously," she said . 

The conrroversial broadcast is 
only the fit t in a serie of sexually 
explicit acts to be aired on "Koala 
TV," York said. Because the Feb. 3 

broadca~t IS sti ll under rcview, any 
other broadcasts that may air on 
the station in the meantime will be 
de:dt with separately, Jccordlllg to 
Vazquez. 

"We're going deal WIth each situ-
ation as it ari es," she said. "Because 

RTV is srudent run, I encourage 
students to voice an)' concerns they 
have to their srudent government." 

With York's next broadcast 
planned for March, SRTV is solicit-
ing student opinions on the porno-
graphic broadcast, Welch stated. 

"If cnough students did not 
want to see Steve York's next film 
that he plans to bring out in March 
- and they voiced this to SRTV-
it will nOl be shown," she stated. 
" However, if enough nldents told 
SRT they did want to set: it, 
SRTV will show it." 

The issue has 31 0 g'lined mtion-
al media attention, ,vith appeara nces

Timing wrong for a 
service workers' strike 

W hen they I,lead out to the polls in March, UC service 
workers should vote against 
a strike. Nothing could hurt 
the workers and the univer-
sity more, at this point, than 
a prolonged labor dispute. 

Clearfy, union members 
have legitimate reasons to be 
angry. They continue to toil 
for poor wages and their 
frustrations are more than 
understandable. 

The case of the service 
workers, however, is only 
one among many unfortu-
nate consequences of the 
bare-bones UC budget pro-
vided by the state in recent 
years. Picketing the univer-
sity would do lIttle to fix the 
underlying problem: inade-
quate state money. 

Labor leaders. have spent 
their time find in g outra-
geous instances of executive 
bonuses and administrative 
raises throughout the UnJ-

versity. While surely unfair, 
these examples provide little 
evidence that the university 
can afford wholesale wage 
hikes for thousands of ser-
vice workers without 
increased state support. 

Instead of searching for 
evidence of malfeasance, 
union heads should work on 
a persuasive case to show 
why the state must send 
more money the university'S 
way. 

To succeed in lobbying 
Sacramento lawmakers for 
increased state support for 
the UC system, university 
administrators, students and 
workers must form a united 
front. A work stoppage 
would distract the universIty 
in its fight for more money 
and likely only hurt universi-
ty staff in the long run. 

Only a unified university 
can succeed in the annual 
battle for a bigger share of 
the state pie. 

Media coverage of York 
incident grossly lacking 
By now it's cliche to attack mainstream television news outlets 
for spreading sensational-
ism, manufactured contro-
versy and downright misin-
formation. When an event 
like the airing of a home-
made sex video on Student-
Run Television is blown out 
of proportion', however, it 

- tarnishes UCSD's reputa-
tion and vastly misrepresents 
a more unexciting truth at 
tile university's expense. 

Coverage of the event, 
even on local television sta-
tions, manufuctured divisions 
between UCSD students, 
when very few students 
watched the broadcast and 
even fewer harbor strong 
opinions about it. Despite 
what the media outlets and 
filmmaker Steve York him-
self may have hoped for, the 
tape hasn't galvanized stu-
dents; rather, the conflict is 
something the university, 

A~soc i atea Students and 
SR1V will likely work out 
between themselves. 

The butchering .of the 
coverage stemmed In part 
from the university's refusal 

to comment on the incident, 
leading media outlets to fill 
the resulting information 
void with token, uninformed 
spokespeople, including stu-
dents mined from unin-
volved groups like Campus 
Crusade for Christ. 

In one sorry example, 
MSNBC's "Scarborougn 
Country" - which had 
York and SRTV station 
manager Chelsea Welch 
appear on Feb. 21 -
misidentified UCSD as "the 
University of San Diego" 
and framed the controversy 
as, "A porn movie at a public 
institution's student-run TV 
station - should you as tax-
payers be paying for it?" 
Host Joe Sca rborough 
ignored Welchs assertarions 
that SRTV is funded solely 
by self-assessed student fees, 
failing to acknowledge the 
real, and very important, 
issue at hand: the ongoing 
dispute between student 
media and a university hat 
claims to allow students to 
settle their own affairs, but 
establishes oversight com-
mittees and initiates investi-
gation , at the sa me time.

Housing and Dining policy changes 
only pave the way for more problems 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

A soon-to-he implemented plan from the On-Campus Residential and Dining Services Advisory Committee will give on-campus 
residents the chance to squeeze a little closer when 
severa l existing two-person rooms become triples , 
University officials are quick to label tlUs space-sav-
ing maneuver a "rate-saver" plan (because they will 
be chargi ng less per persoll for th .. three-person 
rooms). Parents and students are crying foul and 
calling this "opportunity" what it is: a callous eco-
nomic solution to UCSD's overpopulation problem 
that fails to address the issue of insufficient housing, 
akin to slapping a Band-Aid on a hernia. 

UCSD Housing and Dining Services has a histo-
ry of terrible solutions to similar economic prob-
lems. A couple of years ago, its novel solution when 
faced with bankruptcy was to add a mandatory clean-
ing service, as well as force mandatory meal plans 
onto residents of on-campus aparnnents' rendering 
apartment kitchens practically useless. 

Neither triples nor forced meal plans will help 
HDS with its main problem for the immediate 
future : increasing student enrollment. No matter 
how many triples you try to squeeze into the aging 
dormitories, new buildings will need to be con-
structed to deal with the influx of students ifUCSD 
has any hope of promising freshmen two years (or 
even one year) of guaranteed housing. The current 
promise of .two years of housing for every student 
may seem unreasonable given the housing crunch in 
UCSD facilities, but it is necessary due to the even 
larger housing crunch occurring off campus in the 
La J olla/UTC community, due to factors that 
UCSD cannot control. 

However, to make life a bit more bearable for 
those students who do not make the cut for triple 
housi ng, HDS has another proposal which will allow 
commuters to purchase Dining Dollars so that they 
can share all of the advantages of cafeteria food after 
their morning or afternoon commute. Yet, the food 
options offered at the various HDS-operated eater-
ies are unpalatable for vegetarians, those who adhere 
to religious dietary restrictions or anybody who was 
not raised on Easy Mac and paint thinner. Recent 
health grade scores how that the greasy all -night 
fare of loca l taquerias might even be a more sanitary 
alternative to on-campus dining. 

Students on a tight budget could conceiva bly 
benefit from the tax breaks and tiny discounts that 
meal plan currency provides when dining at on-cam-
pus eateries, but these discounts (approximately 10 
percent, including a loss uf sales tax) cannot compare 
to the discounted food at tllC various student-run co-
op eateries. The on ly other reason given for such a 
superfluous plan is that a meal plan could "save stu-
dents time." If UCSD students are incapable of the 
extra effort it takes to keep cash in their wallets, they 
sholll..! never leave camp" to fju. liFy for a "('om 
muter meal plan," for the peels of the outside world 
would eat them alive. 

As can be expected from a plan dreamed up by 
Residential Life committees and A.S. senators, all of 
these are diversionary arguments that attempt to 
appeal to "student savings" or "student conve-
nience" to disguise yet another simple plan to try 
anrl bailout the failing on-campus eateries, much 
:,"" the mandatory aparonent meal plan did earlier. 
Trus is no solution. If they actually wanted to be 
consunier-friendly, they would give commuters the 
same price breaks as everybody else (perhaps at a 
"UCSD student" discount) without forcing com-
muters to buy a meal plan, but that will never hap-
pen. Dining Dollars work like a banl<, and HDS 
makes more profit off of unused meal points at the 
end of each year than they would by serving desir-
able food . 

Neither of the two proposed solutions to housing 
and dining shortages are necessarily bad solutions, 
but they cannot come close to actually solving the 
problems. On the housing front, relentlessly cram-
ming students into rooms in an cffort to spread 
resources thin will provide so few extra rooms that it 
is not even worth implementing for the extra 
bureaucratic costs involved. UC Berkeley, when 
faced with a similar overpopulation problem, initial -
ly tried the "single- room-into-triple- room" plan , 
but eventually had to cave in and start construction 
on some new dormitories to deal with increased sm-
dent enrollment. The difference between UC 
Berkeley and UCSD is that UCSD has no unu cd 
space left; HDS's only remaining option is to level 
existing dorms and build orne new, higher-capacity 
ones. Mter all, those cockroach-infested E.RC dorms 
are beggi ng to be bulldozed. T he replacement of 
buildings is a big and costly endeavor, but is

shortages 
conrinued from page 4 

nonetheless the only solution to 
provide UCSD students a reason-
able amount of housing over the 
next tive years. 

Likewise, HDS needs to imple-
ment more aggressive solutions to 
acrually deal with the culinary 
needs of an increasing student 
body, and offering students who 
have escaped the tyranny of a meal 
plan the option to "extend their 
service" is not one of them. 
Improving the quality of food and 
training student workers might 
entice more eater loya lty and 
improve repeat business. A call-
ahead option at each of their 
restaurants could reduce wait time 
during lunch hours and help HDS 
eateries gain more business as well. 
So would adding a simple cart in a 
high traffic area to sell sa ndwiches 
and drinks; if Espresso Roma can 
erect an ugly strucmre in the mid-
dle of Library Walk, why can't 
HDS do the same along the dread-
ed York Hall to Warren Lecture 
Hall walk? 

With these two pl ans to cram 
students into triples and offer com-
murers caustic grub - all in the 
name of "student savings" - HDS 
has shown that business as usual 
will continue and the quality of liv-
ing arrangements will steadily and 
surely decrease. 

Ever wonder why UCSD alum-
ni donations have been dropping 
off recently' Do you think it might 
have sometrung to do with the 
conditions under which UCSD 
students eat and sleep?

3 :56 a.m., Feb. 20, 2005 -The slot macrune in front of me is fading in and out of 
focus, making it hard to slide my 
crumpled dollar bill into where it 
needs to go. But I have to play it 
cool and function through the haze 
- this is a dare, goddamnit. 

"So, I saw you earlier at Deja 
Vu," I slur toward the girl at the 
machine next to mine. "What do 
you do when you're not there?" 

She leans over to me with a long 
look. "I'm an entertainer, baby" 
(with such a smooth voice .. . ). I 
fumble for a response, nying to talk 
to her II1Ui look interested in the 
game going on in front of me so as 
not to be obvious. But my "credits" 
are dwindling 13ster than I can keep 
track, and I already forgot her name 
... I'm losing on both fronts . And 
things are starting to go blurry 
again .. . 

6:37 p.m ., Feb. 18 - You can 
see the light for miles. It shines on 
the overcast nighttime sky lilc.e the 
fires of hell, layers of gray and 
orange and yellow and black 
writhing rugh above for hal f an 
hour before we come down into the 
valley that holds Las Vegas. Even if 
we weren't stoned - a modest 
transgression, considering the task 
at hand - descending upon Sin 
City by night would have been an 
awesome experience. As we are, it is 
overwhelming. T he pleasure dWl-
geons of the Strip rise up, abla7-c in 
blue, green and yellow, with glass 
walls of lascivious luster. On the 
ground, a clattering serpent of traf-

fie creeps down Las Vegas 
Boulevard, spitting neon offers and 
cheap pollution from rudden speak-
ers and chrome exhaust pipes. 
Waves of pedestrians wander by the 
lake of motor verudes with only the 
inebriated kind of abandon, mosey-
ing across three lanes wrule taxicabs 
aim straight for them. 1llls is chaos 
incarnate. We are overjoyed. 

Chaos, after all, is what one 
would expect on an infamous trip 
that tries, with considerable effort, 
to pay homage to the events of 
"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," 
Hunter S. Thompon's famous

of this insane city. Depraved are the

hooting and holleri ng at every

American hedo-

fanity, where 
American con-
sumption is ele-
vated to 
Dionysian inde-
cency and big-box 
volume, attitude is 
what matters. 
Vegas is a mental 
city, not a physical 
one; you have to 

lessness every year to practice the 
basics of gonzo journalism as pro-
fessed by the originator himself. No 
one had a "briefcase full of uppers" 
or "a salt shaker of cocaine," but we 
pressed our most iU-conceived plots 
into action and had a great, if not 
memorable, time. 

There was just one thing: We 
bore the rainy return from Sin City 
only to find that Dr. Gonzo rumself 
committed suicide on the last day of 
our pilgrimage to his greatest work 
- 0 , irony, what order has our bes-
tial errand Wldone? 

11 :13 p.m., Feb. 18 - I've read 
"Fear and LoatlUng" enough times 
to know that "depraved" is not an 
ori gi nal word to use to descri be 
anything relating to Las Vegas. But 
no other word so perfectly describes 
the look of the plastered partygoers 

check your better 
reasoning at the front gate if you 
want full access. Thompson under-
stood that most of America, from 
the Kentucky Derby to the Hell's 
Angels to even our most exalted 
carnival, the presidential election, 
was the same way. Instead of trying 
to report on it, as most journalists 
do, with dispassionate, unbiased 
accounts, Thompson wrote about 
America as he experienced it: first -
hand, fucked up and soaked from 
gutter to Oval Office with corrup-
tion. H e called it gonzo journalism; 
and it won rum a reputation as a 
dubious counterculture bard, offi-
cial spokesman for the paranoid, 
the underground, the stoned . 
Thompson saw American life a lit-
tle cockeyed and a little hungover 
(as he was), and if not exactly facnl-
ai, rus reports were always honest. 

Gonzo journal ism works to indict 
its creator as much as its subject, 
and Thompson neve r tri ed to make 
himself out to be better than the 
slobs and cheats he wrote about ... 
except when tho e slobs and cheats 
were named ixon and Bush. 

I :08 a.m., Feb 19 - I can ce 
the bulbous pink and cream lights 
of th e Flamingo from here 
(althoug h I don't know if I'm in 
New York or Paris or Rome or 
Egypt) and they seem punishingly 
far away. Every dmnken step is a 
marathon, every energetic reveler 
blocking my way cause fo r the 
immediate demolition of this 
wicked place. I don't know if I'm 
alone or if I'm lost ... (Or where I 
can get more of something, always 
what we're after.) T he madness 
lanterns are reflecting more bright-
ly now off the blood in the streets, 
or is that rain' The neon balloon of 
Paris is wrong, pro foundly. -100 
much cursive - how will we (I .. . ') 
ever make it back? Shiny traffic 
pummeling through the streets; is 
that the howl of a V8 or a bache-
lorette? This is over, done for. I 
look at the slimy gutter and it 
seems comfortable. We'll never 
survive. Might as well ju t lay down 
and ... 

We don't know why Thompson 
took his own life. He suffered from 
back pain, a replacement hip and 
poor health (the consequence of 
covering a corrupt life firsthand), 
and he always joked about taking 
his own life one day. But the king uf 
subjectivity deserves to be judged 
by his own standards. America is a 
depraved land, its cities aglow with 
fear and loathing st ill. Than ks,

T/l L' R~ lll\Y. FEIlRl '!\RY ! 4. !OOS 

In the world of comic book movies, we thought we'd seen it all . Quite possibly the least 
reliable film genre in terms of 
quaitty, even individual comic 
book franc hises have been 
through their share of ups and 
downs, from disappointing ("X-
Men") to im pressive ("X-Men 
2") and from classic (" Batman") 
to downright embarrasing 
("Batman and Robin"). It makes 
sense, then, that nobody expect-
ed "Catwoman" to be very good. 
Nob dy, however. coul d have 
been prepared for JUSt how bad it 
re'llly was. 

I t takes a very specia l kind of 
director to strap Halle Berry into 
a sh redded dominatrix outfit for 
most of her screen time and sti ll 
manage to make the film 
unwatchable. That special kind 
of director is Pitof, a specia l 
effects expert in his first, and cer-
tainly his last, full-length direct-
ing role. Halle Berry begins by 
portraying Patience Phillips, an 
advertising slave so pathetically 
inept and mousish that her mur-
der early in the film seems like a 
mercy kill . 

As Patience's body, washed up 
on a misty dump site, is ressurrect-
ed by a tubby CGI cat, it becomes 
apparent that if Pirof is known for 
his speci al effects work, he must 
have leased the job out to the low-
est bidder. The magical cat's effect 
on Patience is almost instant; it 
instills in her the uncontrollable 
urge to get a makeover. The fol-
lowing scenes, where Berry devours 
cans of tuna and covers herself in 
camip, are inexplicably played in 
dead seriousness, as if Pitof never 
realized how awful it would look to 
have Halle Berry hissing at dogs as 
she walks down the sidewalk. The 
actual plot, which feels more like a 
throwaway subplot from" py Kids 
2," is a paradox in itself. On one 
hand, the "makeup-company-hid-
ing-frightening-side-effects" idea 
could be called an attempt at social 
commentary. On the other hand, 
the most empowering thing about 
post-ressurrection Catwoman 
seems to be her new taste for 
whore-red lip tick. 

Even when the stilleto boots 
and leather push-up bra come out, 
the film never picks up. The thing 
that made Michelle Pfeifer such a 

perfect Catwoman in "Batman 
Returns" was the sinister darkness 
of her character and look. Berry 
mi ght have been able to pull it off 
- she certainly looks the part -
except that the director keeps her 
bathed in so much glowing blue 
"moonlight" that Catwoman, her 
leather and everything around her 
look plastic. 

Though we never find out just 
why Catwoman Likes to bounce 
around on top of buildings, or why 
she made that skimpy suit in the 
first place, we certainly don't care. 
The best part of the film may be 
Sharon Stone as the makeup com-
pany's plastic-faced aging model, 
but since she's essentially spoofing 
herself, the whole bit comes off as 
depressingly desperate. 

The good news? Although 
bad comic book movies ("Spider-
Man") generally have much-bet-
ter sequels ("Spider-Man 2 H), 
"Catwoman" grossed less than 
hal f of its total production 
costs, meaning this is one comic 
book franchise that won't have a 
sequel - let alone nine lives.

Paul Giamatti in uSideways' 

HOW could Oscar ignore Paul Gia matti's performance in "Sideways"? He was the heart 
and soul of one of the most 
acclaimed pictures of the year. 

In "Sideways," Giamatti plays 
Miles, a fai led writer and wine con-
noisseur, whose ability to connect 
with other people is clouded by nis 
own insecurities. Giamatti's painful ly 
honest portrayal of a man coming to 
grips with personal failure is both 
heartbreaking and refreshing. As 
Miles, Giamatti has many scenes 
where he exhibits aH those awkward, 
u ncornforra b I e- i n -your-own -skin 
moments that everybody feels but so 
few actors dare to portray. Giamatti 
may not have the smoldering good 
looks of some of this year's nomi-

nees, namely J ohnny Depp and 
Leonardo DiCaprio, but in 
"Sideways" his face beautifully 
expresses life's hopes and disappoint-
ments in the subtlest way. In the 
past, Giamatti has been known for 
playing supporting parts, in what 
was referred to as "the sight gag" 
role, but now he is garnering more 
and more acclaim. He first got 
recognition as a leading man in 
"American Splendor," and he'll next 
appear alongside Russell Crowe in 
"Cinderella Man." He may have 
been snubbed this year, but at the 
rate he's going, one imagines that an 
Oscar nod is in the near future for 
Giamatti .

Bruckheimer changed it up a bit, replacing 
the Mona Lisa with the Declara ti on of 
Independence. But it dOl!sn't help that the 
"The Da Vinci Code" is written in the mas-
terful style of R.L. Stine' "Goosebu mps" 

"national Treasure' 
seri es. The pier remains as forced as show-
ing up to Monday morning classes and as 
intellectually stimulating as two hours of 
"Blue's Clues." 

The treasure hunter ( icolas Cage) and 
companion (Diane Kruger) don't really do 
anything special, while the sidekick (Justin 
Bartha) reaches a Jar Jar Binks level of 
annoyingness. The onl y good part of the 
movie is when Harvey Keitel arrives, re-
enacting his "Pulp Fiction" role as the man 
you call when yo u fuck up.

With a marquee of prominent names that include icole Kidman, Chrisropher Walken, Glenn Cluse, Bette Mid ler 
and Matthew Broderick, "The tepford 
Wtves" scemed like the must-see coll1edy of 
the summer. Yet when a mm requires "a cou-
ple of additional shoots to sharpen up the 
story line," as director Frank Oz told 
Entertainment Weekly, it is typically not a 
good sign. 

The remake of the original 19r sati re 
about a cOlllmunity of suburban husbands 
who turn lheir wiV(!, into perfect robots 
proves to be a mediocre collection of onc-
liners. The film induces littl e cognition and , 
due to a lack of suspcmc :lIld purpose, it ha, 
little redcellllllg value. S.ldly, the nl:lin actor, 
are, as usual , superb: Kidman skillfully trans-
forms from an energized TV executive at the 
top of her game to a dejected bundle of 
nerves; \\'alken takes a typically zany and 
entertaining turn and CI c hones in on her 
refined shrill madness. Others simply do not 

"The Stepford Wives' 
click: Broderick looks like he took a wrong 
Ulrn when heading to the sou ndstage for 
"ferri s Bueller," 'litHer's character is over-
done and loony, and Roger Bart, as the oblig-
atory gay guy, at times seems to caricature 
J ack from "Will and Grace." But these flaws 
may all stem from the fact that the actors 
simply did not have a witty script to work 
with. 

"The Stcpford \Vives" is the new "Mars 
Attacks," except the latter was clearly a spoof 
made for pure enjoyment. "Mars Attack" 
director Tim Burron actually allowed his for-
midable cast (including, among others, Jack 
Nicholson. Close, Annette Bening, Sarah 
Jessica Parker ano Danny DeVito) to let 
loose and have a blast. For a sati re, "The 
Stepford Wives" takes itself too seriously; for 
a clever comedy, the jokes are too flat and 
illy. Each actor luub painfully constricted in 

the mundane storyline.

"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' 

Girl finally ends up with boy of her . dreams. Boy makes her happy, but girl continues to sabotage and doubt her 
relationship. They break up, but in true 
Hollywood style end up getting back togeth-
er anyway. 

What's the point, you might ask? To make 
the girl doubt herself and realize that, in 
keeping with Sinatra 's classic co-dependent 
song, she really is nobody 'til somebody loves 
her. Welcome to the life of the title character 
in the sequel, "Bridger Jones: The Edge of 
Reason." You might suspect her character 
changed or learned something from the first

tricks and running around mindlessly in 
search of the most cliched form of love. 

When her boyfriend shows the slightest 
signs of having his own life, Jones has a ner-
vous breakdown. Seriously, what happened 
to the idea of having your own space in a 
relationship? Or horror of horrors, being 
single not branding you as the biggest loser

that Jones really is a feminist's nightmare 
come true.

Dave Stewart, 
MlckJaaer 

Alfie 
Virgin 

*** "A lfie" may only be 
remembered as 
another forget-

table Jude Law film, but 
the soundtrack has been 
receiving a lot of atten-
tion, including a Golden 
Globe for Best Original 
Song. While the movie 
was a remake, the sound-
track features original 
tracks cut by Mick Jagger 
and former Eurythmics 
songwriter Dave Stewart. 

Jagge r may seem like a 
peculi ar choice to create a 
musical score , but who 

better to cap ture th e 
mood of a film about a 
womanize r tryi ng to find 
meaning in his li fe than 
someone wh o had the 
experience? 

The disc doesn't exact-
ly play like a soundtrack. 
On its own, it is a collec-
tion of simple folk and 
blues tracks that ease the 
mind, the type of CD that 
could play in the back-
ground for hours without 
bothering anybody. 
However, each song has a 
reflective and atmospheric 
feeling to it, conveying an 
emotion listeners can 
identify with . 

Joss Stone adds some 
soul, appearing on several 
of the more memorable 
tracks, including a remake 
of the original title song 
"Alfie" and "Lonely 
Without You, " a good 
Christmas song for those 
depressed during the holi-
day season . Nothing to 
blow your mind away 
here, just quality music to 
relax to.

Various Artists 
Eternal Sunshine of the 

Spotless Mind 
Hollywood 

**** A listen to John Brion's music epitomizes the pop music addict as 
described in "High 
Fidelity": "The unhappi-
est people I know... are 
the ones who like pop 
music ... and I don't know 
whether pop music has 
caused this unhappiness, 
but T do know that they've 
been listening to the sad 
songs longer than they've 
been living the unhappy 
lives." 

Unhappiness dominates 
"Eternal Sunshine of the 

Spotless Mind." Brion's 
orchestral pop instrumen-
tals reflect the mood of the 
film beautifully. Brion and 
Co. also wisely selected 
pop-rock songs that snugly 
fit Brion's pieces. 

Predictably, Electric 
Light Orchestra's "Mr. 
Blue Sky," two tracks by 
the Polyphonic Spree and 
al t -roc k god Beck's cover 
of a track by pop band the 
Krogis are all there. The 
central track, "Wonder," 
by newer garage band the 
Willowz, rehashes classic 
formulas : the standard 
major (happy) chord pro-
gression changing to 
minor (unhappy), as per-
fected by evetyone from 
the Beatles to Pavement. 
This formulaic approach is 
highly effective and Brion's 
music continuously relies 
upon it. 

indeed, Brion follows 
the blueprint of the lives of 
the characters in "Eternal 
Sunshine," constantly 
changi ng back and forth 
from happy to unhappy.

Shrek 2 
Dreamworks 
Ii; 

Whoever planned "Shrek 2" avoided turning Smash 
Mouth into the "green ogre 
band" by leaving them out 
of the sequel, which made it 
easier for "Shrek 2's" sound-
trad. to do what it should: 
throw out a dozen catchy, 
accessible tracks that mirror 
the carefully mapped plot of 
the film. 

Counting Crows start 
things off right with 
"Accidentally in Love," a 
good theme for Shrek and 

Fiona~ honeymoon. The 
Eels' "I Need Some Sleep" 

and Nick Cave and the Bad 
Seeds' "People in 't No 
Good" do a good job of 
slowing things down. They 
are followed by Pete Yom's 
upbeat "Ever F allen In 
Love" and Jennifer 
Saunders' "Fai ry 
Godmother Song," respec-
tively. Lipps Inc. bring disco 
to the party with 
"Funkytown" while Tom 
Waits' weird "Little Drop of 
Poison" is perfect for the 
Poison Apple, "Shrek Z's" 
version of the Prancing 
Pony from "The Lord of the 
Rings." 

Except for Butterfly 
Bouchers rather unconvinc-
ing rendition of David 
Bowie's "Changes," the 
numerous covers work well. 
Saunders' rendition of 
"Holding Out for a Hero" 
effectively brings the movie 
to a climax. And how can 
you forget Eddie Murphy 
and Antonio Banderas' duet 
in "Livin' La Vida Loca"? 

"Shrek 2" is a fun listen. 
I just hope they use Snoop 
Dogg in "Shrek 3."

FUNNY MOVI:: 

Inane of the most gripping and disturbing scenes of 2004, a doctor escapes th e sha ckles 
of a sinister serial killer named 
Jigsaw by cutting off his own leg 
with a .. . wait why's the audience 
laughing? This isn't supposed to 
be funny. 

"Saw" would have been scary 
and disturbing if it hadn't been 
so funny. It wouldn't have been 
so funny if the acting hadn 't 
been so bad. The acting would-
n't have been so bad if the script 
didn't have some of the poorest 
dialogu e ever written. M ost peo-
ple trapped in a room with a 
dead body would panic. These 
guys, however, thought it would 
be better to sociali ze like middle 
school girl s eluring a sleepove r. 

Like any horror movi e, "Saw" 
has a moving climax with Carey 

"SftW' 
Elwes, the star of movies like 
"The Princess Bride" and 
"Robin Hood: Men in Tights," 
feeling angry, sad and afraid, 
while the only emotion the view-
er experiences is humor. "Saw" 
really wanted to be frightening . 
It had a lot of gore, a creepy 
soundtrack and a dark, grainy 
look to it. Unfortunately, all this 
did was make its shortcomings 
more apparent. 

If you're looking for more 
unintended laughs, try any of the 
other attempts at a horror movie 
this year: "Darkness," "Twisted," 
"The Grudge," "Exorcist: The 
Beginning," it doesn't matter 
which one you pick. You'd be 
better off renting "The Shining" 
or "Seven" instead.

"first Daughter" I"Chasing liberty' 

There are times in life when no matter how much you'd like to rip on a movie, you simply 
aren't wiUing to sit through a free 
two-hour movie screening. But 
since I made up this category, I can 
"review" what were probably the 
worst movies of 2004: "Chasing 
Liberty" and "First Daughter," one 
of which stars Katie Holmes, and 
the other, Mandy Moore. 

"First Daughter"/"Chasing 
Liberty" is the story of a college-
aged girl (played by 
MooreIHolmes) who just wants to 
live a nonnal life. Sucks for her, 
then, that her father is the presi -
dent (overacted by Michael 
Keaton/Marc Harmon). While 
Holmes/Moore has the sweet girl-
next-door loole. down, the acting in 
"Firs! Daughter"/"Chasing 
Liberty" seems plucked from an 

episode of "7th !leaven," with 
stereotypical corning-of-age story-
lines not very well hidden behind 
the presidential plot. Scenes where 
MooreIHolmes is whisked around 
on a motorcycle by a hunky 30-
yea r-old -pia yin g-a -2 O-yea r-ol d 
(Matthew Goode/Marc Blucas) arc 
likely to be gag inducing, and the 
over- the top climax, where 
MooreIHolmes decides to follow 
her hean and somehow manages 
to please her father as well , are 
both predictable and depressing. 

And in case you're wondering, 
Holmes/Moore doesn 't get naked 
throughout the entire film, dissap-
pointing the dozen or so 
boyfriends who got dragged into 
the theater with false promises of 
post-<:hick-flick sex.

"13Goin on 30' 

Pull up a chair, kids, it's time to play "Name that Movie l " Here arc the clues : Kid 
wants ro be older; kid makes a 
wish to be older; kid wale.es up 
the next morning to find he/she 
is now mysteriously ZO years 
older; kid is now trapped inside 
the body of an adult - a gentle, 
romantic comedy ensues. 

Sound familiar? Doesn't it 
sound like that '80s movie where 
a very young Torn Hanks plays 
"Chopsticks" on that big floor 
keyboard thing? The one where 
he goes up to some genie-in -a-
box and wishes to be "big"? Isn't 
it that movie where Hanks 
brings home his lady friend and 

asks to sleep on the rop bunk? 
You know, that movie where he 
gets his own trampoline in his 
apartment? Isn't it that movie 
called "Big"? 

Wrong! I was talking abo ut 
"13 Going on 30." You know, 
the one where a young girl 
wants ro be older, makes a wish 
to be older and wakes up the 
next day to find that she is older. 
Oh wait, that's exactly like 
"Big." Silly me, ['II let you have 
"Big" then since they're pretty 
much the same bloody movie.

Oh yeah, and Seu Jorgc doing

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Swim: Men take top three spots in 200 freestyle 
continued /rom page 12 

women's team was balanced equally 
in the men's side, but the high 
degree of competition there made 
certain victory more dubious. 

"W e knew t he men's team 
would do well, but Bakersfield is 
the defending national champion 
and had something to prove after 
we beat them in a dual meet earlier 
in the season," M cGihon said, "It 
wa my expectation that they would 
be trying to get that one back." 

AI though it would be difficul t to 
identi fy a specific day on which the 
Trirons mens team performed berter 
than another, the high level of inten-
sity that was exhibited in irs races 
was noteworthy, 

Boehm was awarded the PCSC 
male Swimmer of the Year for his 
performance at the meet and 
throughout the rest of the season, 

"[Boehml has been a tremendous 
asset to the team this year," senior 
captain Mark Tate said. "lIe's done 
so well till now, and hes the tOP seed 
in several cvents at NCAAS." 

In the 200 freestyle event on 
Feb. 18, Boehm Icd as three 
Tritons rook three of [he rop four 
places. Touching in at 1:38.8 1, well 
within the Division II "A" qualify-
ing time, Boehm beal Cal State 
Bakersfield 's Piotr Gegotek before 
sophomore Tim Fu ller and Spicer 

came in for third and fourth places, 
respectively. Rounding out the 
event for UCSD, Brady Gosling 
finished seventh and George 
Leicht completed the race in 
eighth place, 

For one team to earn five of the 
top- 10 places in a main event at a 
conference meet is an unprecedent-
ed accomplishment, especially con-
sidering that 35 swimmers were 
entered in the event. 

The team's individual power in 
the 200 freestyle was also evident 
in one of the meet's first events, 
the 800 freestyle re lay, The 
Tritons m en 's team had an " A" 
team entered (mea ning that this 
was the only relay team el igible to 
earn points), as well as a "B" [earn, 
wh ich was permitted to race 
despite being ineffectua l in scor -
ing, The "A" team fini shed the 
race in second place, two seconds 
behind Cal State Bakersfield. Had 
the time for the " B" team been 
eligible, the Tritons would have 
cut a substa ntial part of the Cal 
State Bake rsfield lead with two 
teams in the top-five. 

"The team that was disqualified 
was our "B" relay, so their points 
wouldn't have counted ei ther way," 
M cGihon said , "But that unofficial 
time shows how much strength and 
depth we have. The interesting 

flEl 

J ' " j I J" • , 
' . , " j ., 

thing about that is that we could 
have entered a "C" relay and had all 
three teams be in the top 10." 

Spicer played a key supporting 
role again on Feb. 19 in the 1,650 
freestyle , Tourtellotte won the 
event in 15:50,44 to beat the sec-
ond-place racer, and was followed 
by Spicer, who captured third-
place out of 2 1 swimmers in 
16:09.51. 

"[Our strength is] definitely in 
the fact that we are a preny com-
plete team," McGihon said, "A lot 
of other programs ei ther have split 
teams or don 't have the same kind 
of unity that we do." 

Looking ahead to the CM 
Divi ion II Championships, the 
Tritons are looking for nothing less 
than perfection. 

"We've been looking at a nation-
al championship as our biggest goal 
this season," Tate said. 

Other top contenders on the 
men's ide include defending title 
holder Cal State Bakersfi eld, North 
Dakota and Drury University of 

pringfield, Missouri, 
"We'd like for both team to be 

top-one or top-two, but J definitely 
think it's safe to say we are looking 
for a top-three finish [at the NCAA 
meet], which is something that has 
never been done by this team a t the 
Division II level. "

Spor1s Editor 
Coming off monumental suc-

cess at the Pacific Coast Swim 
Conference Championships held 
from Feb. 16 through Feb. 19 in 
Long Beach, Calif., the Tritons 
women's and men's swimming and 
diving teams are braced for the 
NCAA Division II Championships, 
which begins March 9 in Orlando, 
Fla. 

The No. 3 UCSD women's 
team ~as crowned PCSC champi-
on following its comfurtable win 
over second-place Cal Baptist, 
1449-1131. Senior captain Rosana 
Delurgio led the Tritons as a mem-
ber of the winning 8oo-meter 
freestyle relay, before breaking her 
old NCAA record in the 200 
breaststroke, beating the event's 
second-place finisher by almost 
seven seconds in a time of twO min-
utes, 15.31 seconds. Junior Sophie 
Levy and sophomores Susan Ben 
and Emily Harlan each won events 
and broke school records as the 
llitons captured first-place finishes 
in 10 of the meet's 20 events. 

The No. 3 Triton men took a 
narrow second to defending 
national champion Cal State 
Bakersfield, 1612-1522, despite 
outstanding all-around showings 
by senior PCSC Swimmer of the 
Year Kurt Boehm and sensational 
distance perfonnances by freshman 
Joel Tourtellotte and senior Devin 
Spicer. 

"1 think that the results speak: 
for themselves," head coach Scott 

McGibon said. "We IWIIIl rally

UCS.D fencing team sends four to Junior Olympics 
By EVAN WANG 

Staff Vllriter 
The UC5 D fe ncing team · sent 

four of its brightest young stars to 
the Junior Olympics in Arlington, 
Texas, to compete against the top 
talent in the United States from Feb. 
18 through Feb. 21. 

Freshmen helsea Ambon, 
Ja~un Runyan and Laurel Yi:milos 
and sophomore Ashok Pathi all 
competed in the junior division, 
which was filled with competitors 
age 19 and under. While the majori-
ty of the fencers at the tournament 
were high school or young c liege 
students, some of the competirors 
were as young as 14. Ambort com-

peted in womens epee, Pathi and 
Runyan in men's sabre and Yianilos 
in women's foil. 

The tournament was split into 
two rounds: pool play and direct 
elimination. In pool play, fencers 
were assigned to pools of six or seven 
fencers, and fencers competed in 
round-robin, first- to-five-point 
bouts. After this first round, 20 per-
cent of the competitor w r we d d 
out, and the remaining 80 percent 
competed in first-to-15-point direct 
elimination bouts until a champion 
remained. 

"Tournaments like the Junior 
Olympics are different," Ambon 
said. "The competition is so cut-
throat, because people are fighting 

for these spots on the Junior World 
team, and the competitors are young 
and hungry." 

Runyan, who made his second 
appearance at the Junior Olympics, 
finished 62nd out of 158 competi-
tors. He finished 2-3 in pool play, 
then managed to win his first direct 
elimination bout 15-8 before falling 
in his second, missing out on the 
round of 32, 1}-15. Runyan has 
another year of eligibility in Junior 
Olympic competition. 

"I was hoping to do better in pool 
play," Jason Runyan said. "By not 
perfonning a little better, I made my 
matchups in direct elimination 
rounds a lot more difficult. The 
competition here is a lot stronger. 

GIet D*lGuantan 
o.sh of the Tntons: The UCSD fencing team sent freshmen Chelsea Ambort, Jason Runyan, Lauren Ylanilos and 
sophomore Ashok Pathi to Arlington, Texas to compete in the Junior OIympcs from Feb. 18 through Feb. 21 . 

. --~-----

Because of the stakes, a lot of people 
want to go. You get a lot of people 
and a lot of variety. All in all, you get 
the best fencers around." 

Pathi finished 2-4 in pool play, 
just missing the cut to make direct 
elimination, and finished 141 st over-
all in his final year of eligibility. 

"In my three years at the Junior 
Olympics. this was the most fun I've 
had," Pathi said. "I knew the compe-
tition would be tough, because 
everybody there has to qualify out of 
their divisions, not just anybody can 
go. 50 I just went in hoping to make 
the best of it, have fun and learn a 
few things." 

Ambon took 84th in a field of 
159. After going 3-2 in pool play, she 
entered the first round of direct 
elimination, the round of 128 com-
petitors. Ambort, a veteran of the 
Jtmior Olympics in her final year of 
eligibility, feI! in a heartbreaker, 14-
15. 

"I'm disappointed I didn't do 
better, because I was hoping my 
experience would give me an 
advantage against the younger 
girls," Ambort said. "It's kind of 
interesting though, that I used to 
be the young girl going out and 
upsetting the older girls, and now 
the roles have changed. I just wish I 
could have done better for the 
school's sake." 

Yianilos, in her second year at the 
Junior Olympics, went an even 3-3 
in pool play, good for a spot in direct 
elimination and a bye in the first 
round. However, in Yianilos' first 
direct elimination bout in the round 
of 64, she went down, ending her 
tournament. 

.. After not making it to the direct 
elimination round last year, my goal 
was to not only make it there this 
year, but to make it to the second 
round," she said. "I achieved that, 
and can go back next year to get even 

further." 
Assistant coach Josh Runyan was 

optimistic about what the UCSD 
fencers gained at the meet. 

"After a really strong showing at 
the North American CliP in January, 
we were hoping our fencers would 
perform a bit better at the Junior 
Olympics, but we are mostly just 
gl3n that our fencers went :lnd 
gained some valuable experience," 
assistant coach Josh Runyan said. 

Ambon affirms that the tourna-
ment was a learning experience. 

"Every tournament I go to, I tty 
and take something from it, win or 
lose," she said. "It's always interest-
ing to learn new things, in terms of 
tactical strategy and preparation 
refinement. Also, because you're 
fencing against people you've never 
met before - and you have no idea 
what to expect - it really helps YOll 
prepare [for] similar experiences in 
the future." 

Runyan, Pathi, Ambon and 
Yianilos will join the rest of their 
teammates on Feb. 26 in Irvine to 
compete in the team's final confer-
ence meet of the year. The men 's 
squad, currently undefeated at 8-0, 
hopes to sweep the field against 
UC Irvine, UCLA, University of 
Southern California and UC Santa 
Barbara to complete their perfect 
season and win the conference. 
The women, currently at 7 - I and 
tied with Cal State Fullerton for 
first in the league, hope to sweep 
the field as well. The women cur-
rently hold a slim lead over Cal 
State Fullerton in the tiebreaker for 
first place. 

Next will be the Western 
Regionals on March 5. The Tritons 
will get their shot at individual glory, 
fighting for the right to represent 
the division at the NCAA 
Championships held from March 17 
to March 20.
