President stresses 'war and peace, , 
Governor talks 'bread and butter' 

CLEVELAND (AP) -
President Carter and Ronald 
Reagan pur ued predictable 
strategies in their long-
awaited debate last night, 
making no apparent major 
slips while saying little that 
hasn't been heard through-
out the campaign. 

The big difference was 
they said it this time while 
tanding 15 feet apart. 
They differed sharply on 

the i sue , as well as what 
they empha ized the most. 
For Carter, it was war and 
peace; for Reagan, it was 
bread and butter, Carter's 
handling of the economy. 

millions of Americans who 
listened to the nationally 
broadcast debate that four 
years earlier, when Carter 
wa campaigning again t 
then-President Gerald R. 
Ford, the Democra tic 
chal1enger came up' with 
what he called the 'mi ery 
index." 

That index was the total of 
the rates of inflation and 
unemployment. During the 
1976 campaign, they totalled 
12.5, a figure Cartersaid then 
was too high . 

Now, Reagan said, the 
arne index would be more 

than 20.

Carter kept up his effort to 
portrClY Reagan as too ready 
to re ort to military force, at 
one point describing his 
rival's position on the SALT 
II treaty with the Soviet 
Union as "dangerous and 
belligerent. " 

Each accused the other of 
proposals or practices that 
would fuel inflation. Carter 
called Reagan's proposed 
three-year, 30-percent tax cut 
inflationary and "highly 
ridiculous. "

This situation will be complicated by the

Sponges

Associate News Editor 

Sea sponge that can be 
used as an alternative ·to 
tampon continue to be sold 
at several location in the 
San Diego area, de pit~ a 
report of their ban in Iowa 
after tate re earcher found 
"sand, bacteria and other 
potentially harmful sub-
stances," in them. 

A mem ber of Woman Care, 
a femini t women's health 
center, aid of the report: "I 
can't imagine why they 
would say that they were 
unhealthy." 

Woman Care till el1 the 
ponge and ha made no 

comment on whether or not 
they are going to ban their 
sales at th center. 

"There i an in truction 
booklet that rome with the 
sponge ," aid Diane Be ner, 
a rece~tioni t for Woman 
Care, 'and it ays to boil it 
before u ing it to make ure 
there are no particle of sand 
or coral in it. 

"When its air dried," 
Besner continued, "it's 
considered sterile." . 

The ponge ,which 11 for 
$2.50 each at the center, are 
marketed by the Medicine 
Wheel Herb and Healing 
Collective in an Diego. 

"We get them from a 
number of ource in the 
Mediterranean, and we have 
just tar ted importing our 
own," said one collective 
member. 

"The sponges are blea hed 
and washed before they go on 
the helves," he aid. but he 
didn't know how they are 
"bleached. " 

"They hould be boiled, 
but I don't think there's 
much of a danger" to women 
if they are not, he aid . 

"Countle s generation of 
women have used ponges 
and certain mos e as a 
natural tampon - and as far 
as we know there isn't 
anything harmful in them," 
the spokesman said. 

The Women's Center on 
campus, which no longer 
carry the sponge, had them 
last year. The company that 
supplied them to the center 
clo ed down for unknown 
reasons. 

Approximately 175 faculty members 
attended yesterday's meeting, which was 
dominated by an informal address by 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson. He began by 
expressing his general approval of the 
faculty, the academic program quality and 
good student response at both the graduate 
and undergraduate levels. 

Academic programs, such as the expansion 
of many departments, as well as the 
establishment of Master programs in the 
fields of Management Science and Applied 
Mathematics, were also discussed. Talk of 
establishing a School of Engineering also took 
place. Atkinson said that this nation will 
experience a strong need for trained 
engineers in the coming decade and feels that 
the establishment of an exten ive program 
may erve as a magnet for UCSD and attract 
many tudent . 

TODAY'S WEA TRER 

During the course of the hour long 
discussion, Atkinson touched especial1y on 
minority students and faculty. He explained 
that for the last four years, the percent of 
minority students enrolled has been 
decreasing, as has the number of minorities 
in faculty positions. 

Issues such as housing for both faculty and 
student wa also discus ed. Atkin on said 
that if student housing is amply available, the 
university will be much more attractive to 
tudents in the coming years. Along the arne 

lines, the Chancellor explained that between 
1983 and 1993 a 16 percent drop in college age 
tudent is expected to occur. 

Some member of the faculty expressed 
concern over the fact that this school i 
already thought of as being Math-Science 
oriented, and felt the School of Engineering 
would only enhance that belief. Atkinson, 
however, said that the humanitie would not 
uffer as a result of the Engineering School, 

but added that attracting fund for the 
humanitie will be harder in the year to 
come.

How about 'Nacht und Nebel?' Set backs foreseen for human rights Editor:

Wagner (Dos RMingold, Scene 3): WASHINGTON, DC -

During a visit to Washing-
ton recently, the leader of 
the Guatemalan Christian 
Democratic Party, Vinicio 
Cerezo, was asked how he 
saw the future for human 
rights if Ronald Reagan 
became president. He 
replied diplomatically: "It 
would be in the strongest 
national interest of the US 
for Reagan tocontinuethis 
country's support for 
human rights in Latin 
America." 

has consistently stressed a 
building up of America's 
defenses. an expanded 
military role for the United 
States abroad and a 
strengthening of US ties 
with Third World allies 
such as South Korea, 
Taiwan and Argentina, 
which have blatantly 
violated human rights.

We're not playing parlor games 
and this is not a Sunday tea ... 
Editor: 

Once again I am forced to 
respond to my many 
detractors. First of all, I 
would like to commend Mike 
Schwartz on his herculian 
exercise in sarcasm. I loved 
it. 

MN Plano accused me of 
intemperance in his letter. He 
says that I don't use logic and 
facts. Why, heavens, I even 
offend people of good will, 

Well, let me say this, MN, 
the political game is a rough 
one. We're not playing parlor 
games and this is not a 
Sunday tea. This is real life, 
and people sweat, bleed, 
suffer and die. 

You say that I don't use 
logic and facts. Unfortunate-
ly, MN, we're not talking 
physics here. Out in the real 
world, facts and logic can be 
used to say anything. In 
short, I'm not afraid to call 
Ronald Reagan what he 
really is. And if that offends 
you, MN Pru frock , then get 
thee to a laboratory; your 
timid, Thurber·esque soul 
won't be disturbed there by 
the strong statements of 
politics. 

Politics is a game of the 
heart. One can't say that one 
side is logical and one is 
not. Each faction has its own 
peculiar sort of logic. Thus, 

in politics, one must act upon 
the strength of one's 
convictions.

Cerezo's appeal was 
spoken with conviction, 
for 27 members of his 
opposition party have been 
assassinated by death 
squads over the past year. 
Cerezo himself is on a 
death list which he claims 
the Guatemalan regime 
has prepared . 

His sentiments reflect 
the growing anxiety 
among the human rights 
groups in Washington 
whose numbers and 
influence have grown 
since the Carter Admini-
stration made human 
rights a key plank of its 
foreign policy. After four 
years, during which most 
activists agree the human 
rights situation in Latin 
America has benefitted 
from American support, 
they are now asking if the 
momentum can be main-
tained in a Reagan 
administration. 

Unlike Carter, Reagan 
has specifically excluded 
human rights as a foreign 

. policy concern. Reagan 

Robert Milliken, an 
Australian journalist now 
seroing a fellowship in the 
US, wrote this for the 
Pacific News Service. 

But rather than seeing 
an end to the human rights 
movement, most groups 
anticipate their role will 
increase under a Reagan 
presidency, and some are 
already planning such a 
scenario. Laurence Birns, 
director of the Council on 
Hemispheric Affairs 
(COHA), a re earch group 
on LatinAmerica, says: "If 
Reagan wins, it will be bad 
for human rights in Latin 
America, but good for 
human rights groups like 
COHA. There will be more 
work for us and more need 
for resources. II 

lo-Marie Griesgraber, 
deputy director of the 
Washington Office on 
Latin America, agrees that 
by proclaiming a vocal, 
explicit human rights 
policy, the Carter Admini-
stration has helped temper 
more violations than 
would have been the case 
otherwise. The Office was 
formed after the 1973 coup 
in Chile and Uruguay.

I . Racism and class ism seen during times of war 

BY EDWARD WILUAMS 
Let's face it, when draft registration 

becomes a draft, and when the draft is 
use(fto fuel a war with young bodies, 
students attending this university are 
not likely to be on the front line, let 
alone in the army. 

In theory, the elimination of student 
deferments this time around is meant 
to make draft registration and a draft 
fair because: (1) during the Vietnam 
war, many white middle-class kids 
evaded their "patriotic duty" to serve 
their nation by trying to get an 
education, leaving the fighting to be 
done by poor people and people of 
color, and (2) the volunteer army since 
Vietnam has attracted poor and 
minority people, leaving our present 
military lacking the education and 
skill levels for an optimum 
performance. This theory distorts 
reality, and to demonstrate this 
requires that we examine it closely_ 

To bein with, high unemployment 
and limited opportunites in the 
general society (sy,mptoms of class 
and national oppressIOn) have made 
the army. traditionally, a means of 
escaping the ~hetto; a means of 
upward mobility for national 
minorities and the poor. With respect 
to the current volunteer army, rea-
sons for enlisting is aggravated by

those who are volunteering are

ed,tor (The Daily Guardian. Oct 16). 

white kids, creating a sharp division 
between them and a white officer 
corps, many of whom are academy 
tramed. Talk about being "fair" and 
needing "education and expertise" is 
just a cover for old-fashioned racism 
and classism. White, middle-class 
commissioned officers don't like to 
deal with poor soldiers, and especially 
poor minority soldiers. 

In times of war, this racism and 
c1assism has a very concrete 
expression; black and brown people, 
and to a lesser extent poor white 
people, die proportiol}ally far in excess 
of their numbers in the general 
population. Black and brown soldiers, 
and to a lesser extent poor white 
soldiers. are the first to be sent to the 
front lines, whereas middle-class 
white soldiers remain in the rear, or 
stateside at desk jobs. To demonstrate 
that the poor and national minorities 
are keenly aware of their oppression, 
it is not necessary to detail the 
statistics from Vietnam, where 
soldiers on the front lines blew away 
their officers. And we need only 
mention the racial strife and rioting in 
the US army stationed in Europe, or 
the fact that European terrorism, like 
the West German Red Army Faction, 
was supplied in part by sympathetic 
soldiers in the US army. 

:rhis not only reinforced their 
prejudices, it worried the white officer 
corps, not to mention the white ruling 
class. Now that they know it is 
difficu It to get black and brown people 
to fight people of color across the 
ocean, what happens when the 
national guard has to be called out to 

quell future Miamis, or to put down a 
radical industrial strike; given that 
the reserves more and more will be 
composed of national minorities and 
poor whites. The fear of race and class 
war is very real. 

Now let's examine the situation for 
white, middle-class young people. Not 
subject to the economic pressures of 
the "poverty draft" as described above 
their participation in the army is 
based more on the nature of the war 
the US is fighting. At the beginning of 
Vietnam, when Americans accepted 
that we were fighting for truth, 
justice and the American way, white, 
middle-class kids readily volunteered 
for the army, and the military had 
little problem with resistance. But 
when it became clear that the 
American way meant supporting 
imperialism and dictatorship, 
resistance increased as did reliance on 
deferments such as the l·S student 
deferment. 

This author does not support an 
army maintained by conscription, nor 
a volunteer army maintained by a 
"poverty draft," however, this essay 
is too long to go into viable means of 
defending the territorial United 
States from invasion. Suffice it to say 
that an armed people and guerrilla 
warfare can defeat even a highly 
technological enemy such as the 
Soviet Union . As a strategy, an armed 
people and guerrilla warfare would 
protect Western Europe from a 
permanent Soviet occupation while 
avoiding the terrors of a limited 

nuclear conflict that wou ld 
nevertheless devastate all ot Europe. 
In all p'robability, an armed people and 
guernlla warfare will eventually drive 
the Soviets out of Eastern Europe. 

That resistance to Carter's draft 
registration, in many ways, starts 
where resistance to Vietnam left off 
indicates that people are realizing that 
the reasons for draft registration are 
so much shuck and jive. But this does 
nothing to eliminate the economics of 
the "poverty draft" that pressures 
poor black, brown and white kids togo 
into the military. In particular, 
students at universities have legal 
and counseling services, as well as 
organizations like San Diego Students 
for Peace that present such things as 
forums with the National La~ers' 
Guild, all of which make in unhkely 
that university students will be 
drafted. 

If we want to insure that our 
resistance is effective against draft 
registration, then we have to widen 
the resistance movement to include 
non-white. non-middle class, non-
student young people. We need to open 
the university and its services to the 
community, first by lobbying through 
established channels and educating 
the student population. If thi does not 
work, then we can train our own 
student draft counselors to create an 
alternative program open to poor 
white and minority people. This is the 
first point, the starting point of a 
three·point strategy that the 
R.esistance Center thinks is needed to 
defeat draft registration. . '

Festival Choices Become 
More Non-Commercial 

But the Movies are Still Interesting 
In Third Year of Annual Show 

BY TED BURKE 
Special to the Daily Guardian 

As one of the few "critics" in 
town to ' ee the preview 
screeni ng for the San Diego 
International Hilm Festival. 
scheduled from now until Nov. 3 
at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art, I'm inspired 
to think that the movies reflect 
Frank Zappa's description of his 
music: no commercial potential. 

This isn't to say that the films 
are so irredeemably bad that no 
one, intellectual and lowbrow 
alike, would sit through them-
far from it - but the festival 
board has gone out of its way to 
have an international collection 
of film· makers whose works fall 
well outside the norm for the 
movie going public , films that 
one isn't likely to see at the Guild 
or Fine Arts, let alone UTC. 

In any case, this year's movie 
crop isn't bound to please 
everyone. For my part, basing 
my judgement on evidence of the 
six screenings I attended, [ have 
to give an appreciative grin. 

# 
First off I may as well deal 

with the film that did the least 
for me, Radio On, a Briti hand 
German co·production directed 
by C hri topher Peti t. 

Petit is the former film critic 
for the British weekly Time Out 
and i a film theortician in good 
stead who, following the 
preceden t set by New Wa ve icon 
Godard, Rivette and Traffaut , 
has decided to put theory into 
practice and become a film · 
maker himself. The problem is 
shamele s emulation and a lack 
of insight into the subject 
matter. 

Radio Otr concern itself with 
a young London disc·jockey on 
the way to Briston to uncover the 
mysteriou circumstances 
behind his brother's death. His 
subsequent encounters leave 
him with a feeling of alienated 
finalty, ennui and despair . 
Filmed rather well in blac~ and 
white over a terrian of freeways, 
bleak country road and a hen 
city·scapes, the film fairly reeks 

01 work by German director Wim 
Wenders. It features Wenders· 
like lon~takes, ponderou ly slow 
expo itlOn shot and muted 
emotions of characters, who are 
unabl to communicate much at 
all. 

Petit, though, seems to have 
misread Wenders, who in films 
like Alice in the Cities, Kings of 
the Road and The Amen'can 
Friend. is usually able to 
investigate such things as 
cultural dislocation, the 
ramifications of the cargo-cult 
on post·War Europe, how pop 
culture mythologizes reality and 
how those verities come to play 
in the psyches of his characters. 

Petit's people merely strike a 
stance of thin·skinned alienation 
and sulk as the camera soaks in 
the impressively miserable 
environs, like a working·class 
bar, a rural gas station, and all 
night bakery. What does Petit 
intend to tell us? I suspect his 
intentions are nothing more 
than to show us that civilization 
is unable to give us the things we 
need. American director Bob 
Rafelson intended much the 
same with his Hue Easy Pieces, 
but succeeded . Rafel on at leas t 
gave us the benefit of character 
development, an archaic notion 
to many vanguardi ts but a ploy 
that still gave Pieces a structural 
coherancy. In es ence. Radio 011 
is empty and intellectually nil. 

# 
Femme E~ltre Chien EI Loup, 

or Womall Between Dog and 
Wolf, directed by French director 
Andre Delvaul\, i a nicely 
wrought film about stoicism. As 
Belguim is pushed into World 
War II, a man joins the pro·Nazi 
nationalist movemenfand leave 
to join the conquerer of the 
Eastern Front. Tn the interim, 
hi s wife (Marie Chri tine 
Barrault) i treated with hatred 
by her neighbors, retreat into 
the anctuary of her hou e, and 
tries her best to maintain a home 
of order and normalicy. 

A re i tance fighter takes 
refuge in her cellar, culminating 
in their having an affair, and the 

resistance fighter's vouching for 
her against revenge· minded 
neighbor s : Through the 
re istance fighter's interce ion, 
her hu band i pared the death 
penalty and returns home , and 
from there he develops an 
obsession for his former cause, 
unable to adjust to present·day 
realities. He continuall y tries to 
justify his past by writing his 
memoirs. 

Dclvaux handles this story 
with a neat, precise hand , 
especially in his editting. Instead 
of going the fashionably "arty" 
route of long takes, the scenes 
are brief and succinct, 
establishing their plot 
particulars and schematic cues 
rapidly, then fading away 
gracefully as the screen darkens 
and then awakes on another 
local and incident. 

# 
The wst 0/ the Blue Devils. 

directed by American Bruce 
, Ricker, is a documentary about 

the Kansas City jazz scene. It 's 
also a case of taking the good 
along with the bad. The bad in 
this case is the editing, which is 
aimless and leaps from one thing 
to another with little cohesion , 
most specifically in the way 
Ricker juxtaposes vi~tage 
footage of Count Basie and Ivory 
Joe Hunter with more recent 
film. 

The good are the performanc· 
e, induding uperb concert 
footage of Bas ie and his band, a 
jam e sion bet ween axaphon· 
ists Paul Quinchette, Charles 
McPhearson, a tromboni t and 
the blues vocals of Hunter, 
whose capacity to belt a lyric 
ha n't dimini hed a bit in his 
older years. 

Generally, a me y but fun 
movie.

Less Commercial Movies at Fest 
continued from page 5 
notes say the movie is a bit of 
"historical speculation" 
about an alleged hason 
between Hitler and Marlene 
Dietrich . Thefilm's intention 
is less than the far-fetched 
speculation one would 
suspect. It is an exercise in 
turning the Hitler persona 
into an excuse for buffoon-
ery, castinll him as an 
ideological Imbecile whose 
various diatribes, much of it 
taken from Mein Kempf, 
collapse under the weight of 
their illogic. 

The Hitler character, 
ph\Yed unctuously by Karl 
Raab, is a man of penuliti-
mate pettiness, unable to 
distinguish between the 
drive for power and affection, 
between sentiment and 
mawkishness, clear thinking 
and lunatic espousals. 

The effect is comic, but 
also underlines the tragedy of 
power becoming a thing in 
and of itself, without purpose 
or goal. 

In all, Aldoph a1Ul Marlene 
is comic enough to elicit some 

self-satisfied snickers, 
though I could have done 
without the ending. As 
Hitler's and Eva Braun's 
bodies burn during the fall of 
Berlin, Marlene and her 
manager Luminski drive by 
and stop while, unfathoma-
bly, a group of Black 
American GI's stand in the 
foreground on some steps. 
Marlene hands Luminiski a 
small globe small as an egg 
shell, and he perches it 
daintly on his fingertips . 
"Don't you have a bigger 
globe?" he asks her, eyes 
heavy_ Marlene smiles icily 
and drives off . . 

Weird, no? Symbolic, no? 
The conclusion seemed a 
trifle arty to me, an intrusion 
that muddled what until then 
had been a well·played 
absurdist comedy, Lam mel 
would have served his 
purposes better had he 
eschewed all these meta-
phors and had played it 
straight. 

# 
Of the six films I viewed, 

the most problematic was 

Elisa, Vida Mia (Elisa My 
Love) by Spain's Carlos 
Saura. It is an arid . 
fragmented. maddeningly 
slow meditation on love and 
hate, life and death, reality 
versus illusion, and maybe a 
couple of other themetic 
dualisms I missed along the 
way. 

A woman (Geraldine 
Chaplin) gO"s to visit a 
retired man (Fernando Rey) 
who lives in an isolated house 
in the far reaches of Spain. 
From there she encounters 
various hallucinations about 
the lives, deaths. and loves of 
herself and other people, and 
a general confusion of what is 
real or imagined . 

No doubt, as the program 
notes say, that Saura's 
intention is not to provide 
any clean answer to the 
dilemma. but to "_ .. evince the 
linking of imagination and 
memory ," but for me the film 
is a labored affair, top-heavy 
with its own importance.

On the Other Hand . 

L 'lmportant C'est D'aimer 
(The Important Thing is to 
Love) a French, Italian and 
German release directed by 
Andrzej Zulawski, is great, a 
love story that goes beyond 
the tawdry wrappings of the 
genre and deals with love in 
connection with guilt. 
indebtedness. and commit-
ment. 

Romy Schneider, an 
actress lately reduced to 
making porno films, meets up 
with Fabio Tassi. a cynical 
photographer. who at first is 
interested only in exploiting 
her. But he falls for her and 
tries to help her by financing 
a revival of Richard Ill. To do 
so Tassi goes into debt to a 
lecherous uncle. a thuggish 
pornographer for whom 
Tassi unwillingly works. 
The potential affair between 
Tassi and Schneider doesn't 
occur because she is married 
to an i!llpotent husband 

(jacques Dutronc). w ho 
pulled her. from dru g 
addiction and prostitut ion, 
and to whom she eels an 
incalcuable, unpayable debt. 

What is set up is a complex 
arrangement of relationships 
in which characters are 
bound toone another through 
debts and commitments to 
intangible virtues. Tassi is 
indebted to his gangster 
uncle who feels he's owed the 
loyalty of a son to a father . 
Schneider is attached to her 
husband, who feels guilty 
about not being able to 
perform sexually. More than 
that, the film is about set of 
values, a search to have love 
and sex mean something in a 
culture that uses it as a 
commodity, as barter at the 
lowest level of human 
exchange. 

The film is taut as a guy-
wire as the emotional 
tension. and the violence and 
fighs are the explosions of 
frustrated, emotionally· 
constrained characters who 
can't seem to break out of 
their respective cells.

'Oh God - Book II' is 
Inspiration for AtheisDl 

Not Even George Burns Can Save This 
Cluttered Committee- Written Junk 

BY RICK GREENE 
"'aft W riler 

God is back in town. Maybe I should 
rephrase that and say God's new movie is in 
town. Or it might be even better if I said a 
new movie about God is in town. But the 
best thing I could possibly say is don't go see 
God's new movie about God which is back in 
town. 

Weil, it's not actually back in town 
because it was never here before. I don't 
think it would be back again unless it never 
came in the first place. 

Oh, God - Book llis the title ofthe film. It 
is not an' accurate title because the film is 
not a sequel to the popular 1977 Carl Reiner 
comedy Oh. God. 

A sequel is a film which, like The Empire 
Strikes Back and Rocky II, tries to build upon 
the premise of the original story and carries 
the story further. Oh. God - Book II is, in 
fact, a remake of Oh. God, ignoring all the 
events of the original and simply re-doing 
them. 

George Burns plays God again, and 
therein lies the only strength of Oh. God -
Book II. Burns always shines no matter'how 
terrible his movie. In his second portrayal of 
God, he comes across wise. witty. 
understanding. caring and a wiz at one-
liners. 

This time. God wants everyone to know 
He's still around (just like last time), and 
that He still cares Gust like last time). He's 
worried that people on earth (or more 
specifically. Southern Californians where 
He seems to concentrate His activities) 
aren't thinking about Him, so he enlists the 
help of a winsome younaster named Tracy. 

Tracy is played by Louanne. billed 

without a last name in a misgUided effort to 
make the film special. Tracy's parents are 
played by Suzanne Pleshette and David 
Birney, who are happily divorced. 

The parents act upset when Tracy and 
her oddly coop«:rative little chums deface the 
entire city With ugly "Think God" posters. 
Soon the message is flashing acr08S the 
Eiffel Tower and the Goodyear blimp while 
poor, abused Tracy is the center of an idiotic 
worldwide controversy and is threatened 
wit h institut ional imprisonment. 

The big problem with OIl, God - Boolt II 
is that it isn't funny. When you've got five 
writers working on one screenplay. you 
know something is wrong. 

The original Oh, God hid real charm, was 
truly funny and made a worthwhile 
comment about belief. That one had only 
one writer. Larry Gelbart, the man who 
brought M"'A "'S"'H to television and wrote 
many of the scripts for its first five years. 
The "too many cooks" on Oh, God - Book II 
not only spoil the broth. but rip our napkins 
and tab us with forks as well. 

The dubious spectacle of George Burns 
(who is absent from the screen for fifteen 
and twenty-minute intervals) speeding 
along on a motorcycle or turning day into 
night merely has theater-goers hoping for a 
burning bush or a plague to pep things up.

LOS ANGELES -
Several major fires swept 
across 10,000 acres of 
California brushland

The worst blaze, dubbed 
the Owl Fire, roared across 
nearly 8,000 acres of canyons

UCSD distributor 
for rabies vaccine 

The new rabies vaccine dispensinK center for entire San 
Diego county is now located at UCSD Medical Center. 

Individuals requiring rabies shots may go directly to the 
emergency room at University Hospital there. Physicians 
may obtain the vaccine from the Medical Center pharmacy, 
designated as the distribution center after the 
manufacturer announced that the limited supply would be 
restricted to state and federal institutions. The vaccine had 
formerly been distributed by Mercy Hospital . 

The new vaccine, which cuts the length of treatment 
from 23 to five daily injections. has only recently been 
approved for use in the United States, although it has been 
used widely in Europe and elsewhere. Produced in France 
from human diploid cell cultures, it appears to eliminate 
the severe side effects and much of the pain connected with 
the older vaccine derived from duck cells. It is injected into 
a shoulder muscle, a less sensitive area than those required 
for the earlier vaccine shots. 

ShoiIld yu go immediately for a rabies shot if an animal 
bites you? Yes, if it 's a wild animal, particularly a bat or 
skunk. If it's a healthy dog or cat, you can wait until it is 
quarantined, advises Dr. James V. Dunford, assistant 
director of Emergency Medical Services at the Medical 
Center. 

More rabid bats are reported than any other animal in 
San Diego County, according to Dunford. Skunks, foxes, 
coyotes and raccoons also are high rabies risks, but any bite 
from an unprovoked animal is worrisome. In general, bites 
given by dogs and cats w hen provoked do not carry rabies, 
and there is time to take the vaccine after the quarantine 
ends if the animal should prove to be rabid. 

If a dog or cat is healthy after 10 days of Quarantine. it 
does not have rabies. If the dog or cat escapes and can't be 
quarantined, Dunford advises checking with your doetur 
or the Public Health Department about the advisability of 
shots, Hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, SQuirrels, rodents 
and rabbits have not been known to cause human rabies in 
the United States. 

"Although treatment should be given as soon as possible, 
vaccination even much later is still effective," Dr. Dunford 
said . "Rabies may not show its effect for many months. "

Drugs and livers 
A technique which may 

useful for targeti ng drug 
and other agen ts to the liver 
has been developed by 
re earchers at the UCSD 
School of Medicine . Its future 
uses may incl ude the 
diagnosi and treatment of 
liver tumor or di order 
involving liver metabolism . 

Alan D. Attie, Ph.D .. Ray 
C. Pittman, Ph .D., and 
Daniel Steinberg, M.D., 
Ph.D., of the division of 
metabolicdi ase, reported in 

the Oct. 1980 is ue of 
Proceedings 0/ the National 
Academy 0/ Sciences, that the 
molecule which tran port 
cholesterol in the blood, 
known as low density 
lipoproteins (LDL), can be 
chemically modified 0 that 
they seek out and attack 
exclusively to liver cells. 
Without thi s chemical 
modifiction, LDL molecules 
would be taken up by every 
ti ue in the body . 

In rat tudies. the 

re earcher modified the 
LDL molecules by ooupling 
them with a sugar, 
galactose. (A blood sample is 
necessary to isolate the LDL 
molecules, coat them with 
galactose and re·inject them 
back into the bloodstream.) 
Liver cells have such a strong 
attraction for galactose that 
they rapidly bind to anything 
coated with it.

specially designed to test 
large rock amples at stresses 
of up to 500,000 psi, and will 
contribute to both energy and 
weapons programs at LASL. 

The gas gun is used to 
generate shock waves strong 
enough to crush most rocks 
by propelling flat plates into 
the rocks at velocities 
between 10 meters per second 
and 400 meters per second. In 
order to get good measure· 

ment s at the low es t 
veloci ties, the gun is designed 
to keep the angle between the 
flat plate and rock smaller 
than four thousandths of a 
degree. This very tight 
specification makes the gun 
the most precise research 

. gun in the world. 
Measurement of stress and 

strain in the rock during the 
few microsecond duration of 
the shock enables Geoscien-

ces Div ision scientists to

processes that lead to 
prediction of the effects of 
explosions in rocks, such as

these tests. The strength of 
the rock varies considerably 
with size, larger rocks being 
weaker . Rocks are not 
homogeneous on small 
scales; they are composed to 
separate grains of different 
minerals and even of separate 
pieces of older rocks. 

Thi s work will be part of 
LASL's three·pronged 
approach to development of 

. in ·situ retorting techniques 
for producing oil from the 
vast oil shale deposits in 
Colorado. Laborato~ work of 
this sort will provide the 
basis for physical descrip-
tions of phenomena occur-
ring when explosives are 
detonated in oil shale. 

Computer models are 
checked against laboratory 
data where exact loading 
conditions are known. The 
models are then used to 
design more complicated 
experiments both in the 
laboratory and in the field . 

Evidence for phenomena 
observed in the laboratory in 
simple geomet rics such a~ 
plastic yielding, micro-crack 
growth and large·scale 
fracture are al 0 sought in 
the much more complicated 
field experiments to improve 
understanding of th e 
processes. The field 
experiments will be conduc-
ted in an oil shale mine near 
Anvil Points, Colorado. 

These investigations will 
also be applicable to other 
orogram . For example, 
successful containment of 
radioactive gases from 
underground nuclear tests at 
the Nevada Test Site depends 
on knowledge of the respons 
of alluvium and tuff to 
dynamic loads of explosive . 

LASL is operated by the 
University of California for 
the lIs Department of 
Energy. Laboratory director 
is Donald M. Kerr.

The Daily Guardian Wednesday, October 29, 19&0 

Debate Human Rights Liver 
continued from PAle 1 
saying, "I consider myself in 
the mainstream," a coupling 
that seemed to imply Reagan 
was somewhere outside the 
mainstream. 

When it was Reagan's turn 
to close, his appeal was clear 
and direct. He said if listeners 
think the nation is as strong 
today as four years ago, they 
should vote for Carter. 

Giving his own answer, he 
said: "This country doesn't 
have to be in the shape that it 
is in ... AII of this can be cured 
and aU of it can be solved." 

Earlier. the president said 
Reagan's vow to scrap the 
proposed SALT II treaty with 
the Soviet Union is "a very 
dangerous and disturbing 
thing." 

"I am not talking of 
scrapping," Reagan replied, 
saying he wants to take the 
treaty back into renewed 
n.tiations with the Soviet 
Union. "That is hardly 
throwing away a treaty and 
Jeing opp,osed to arms 
limitation, ' he said. 

"Governor Reagan is 
making some very mislead-
ing and disturbing state-
ments," Carter shot back. He 
said Reagan wants to discard 
the treaty, and suggests that 
nuclear superiority, and the 
threat of an arms race, would 
be US bargaining positions 
under a new GOP admini-
stration. 

Reagan said his policy 
would not be to insist on 
American nuclear superior-
ity, but to call for mutual 
arms reductions "to the point 
that neither country can 

represent a threat to the 
other." 

"This attitude is extremely 
dangerous and belligerent in 
tone, even though said in a 
quiet voice," Carter said. 

"To maintain .. . peace 
requires strength," Reagan 
countered. "America has 
never gotten into a war 
because we were too strong. 
We can get into a war by 
letting events ~et out of hand 
as they have 10 the last 3 th 
years." 

Carter countered that he 
has kept the peace, said his 
administration has been 
steadily, carefully increasing 
the nation's defense 
commitment. He said he has 
used that power to preserve 
peace. 

"I think habitually 
Governor Reagan has 
advocated the injection of 
military forces into troubled 
areas when I and my 
predecessors ... have advoca-
ted resolving those trou bles 
peacefully and diplomati-
cally," the president said. 

Reagan assailed the 
administration on the 
continued captivity of 
American hostages in Iran, 
saying that when they are 
released and safe, Congress 
should investigate the 
government's response to 
their year-long ordeal. 

"Once they are safely 
here ... then I think it is time 
for us to have a complete 
investigation as to the 
diplomatic efforts made in 
the beginning, why have they 
been there so long, and what 
did we do to bring that 
about," Reagan said.

provements in Bolivia, 
Ecuador, Peru, the 
Honduras and the D0-
minican Republic," she 
says. "The elections in 
those countrie were tied 
somehow to the fact that 
the US would smile on 
their initiatives. 

"In Chile and Paragu~y 
the situations have 
improved and in Argentina 
disappearances have 
fallen from 15,000 between 
1976 and 1979 almost to the 
point of stopping." 

Griesgraber says the 
main fear now is the fateof 
the human ri~hts perfor-
mance. the leSllslation was 
originally opposed by the 
White House on grounds 
that it would tie the 
President's hands in 
foreign policy. But, says 
Greisgraber, the legisla-
tion-especially the bans 
on US aid to Argentina and 
Chile-is in danger of 

Ing reversed regardless 
of whether there is a 
Repu blican or Democratic 
congress after November. 

"Argentina has deve-
loped close trading ties 
with the Soviet Union, and 
thi scares the .US 
military," s he says. 
"There is tremendous 
pressure building up in 
Congress to eliminate the 
arms legislation." 

G reisgraber foresees 
some likely changes under 
a Reagan presidency: "I 
expect that a Reagan 
administration would 
warm up relations with 

Argentina and Brazil, 
renew relations with Chile 
and then concentrate its 

strat~ies on the Carib-
bean, she says. 

"It would also probably 
stop aid to Nicaragua and 
resume covert political 
activites. " 

Cindy Buhl, of the 
coalition for a New Foreign 
and Military Policy, whose 
43 member-organizations 
include several human 
rights groups, agrees that 
Reagan would seek an 
accomodation with Argen-
tina, Chile and Brazil. She 
suggests that human 
rights groups would 
flourish under Reagan . 
"There is nothing like a 
clear enemy to draw people 
together." 

But if there is agreement 
on the outlook, there i 
un certainty over the 
strategy. Human right 
activists anticipate that, 
as under Nixon, there 
would be little, if any, 
acce s to State Depart-
ment officials, and 
certainly nothing like the 
open contacts and 
information trading that 
has gone on between the 
State Department and 
human rights workers in 
recent years. 

In spite of the disquiet 
over future policy, the 
human rights groups are 
optimistic on one point. 
They believe events in the 
last few years have firmly 
established human rights 
as a public issue in 
the United States

non by chemically linking a 
drug to these modified 
lipoproteins," Attie said . 
"This drug would then be 
carried exclusively to the 
liver. 

"In the case of drugs which 
are damaging to bone 
marrow or other tissues, this 
method would be e pecially 
useful , since almost none of 
the drug would get into other 
parts of the body." 

Attie says that radioactiv,.e 
materials cou ld also be 
attached to the lipoprotein for 
delivery to the liver. Thi 
could aid physicians tn 
diagnosi ng liver tumor 
using the standard imaging 
methods in radiology.

Mellby hopes to get at least 
500 of the 950 on·campus 
re idents at Muir involved in 
the " Make A Friend " 
program. He would also like 
to get many of the 1,500 off-
campu ' Muir t udents 
involved. 

Mellby picked up the idea 
for "Make·A·Friend" from a 
similar program at the 
University of Indiana, where 
he wa a resident advisor. 
"Make-A·Friend" was a 
"tremendous success" there, 
he says.
