A rape

Rape is at an 

epidemic level at 
UCSD , terrorizing 
women who know 
~ow bad the problem 
IS. 

There were at lea t 
12 rapes or attemp-
ted rapes last quar-
ter , more than one a 
week, and the evi-
dence is that the 
problem i getting 
worse, not better. 

Yet campus rape 
prevention projects , 
like Joe's Escort 
Service, are the 
victims of budget ' 
cuts , and police here 
have no program to 
let people know 
there is a problem, 
let alone to cure one.

Levi's bluejean settlement a meaningless hoax 
BY DON KASS 

AND JON HABER 
A proposed settlement has 

just been reached in one- of 
the largest class action suits 
in state history, promising to 
return miiliums uf dollar to 
California's consumers. The 
problem i that hardly 

anyone will benefit. except 
perhaps Attorney General 
George Deukmejian . 

Strauss of San Francisco, the 
world's largest manufacturer 
of western wear. Initially 
accused of price fixing five 
years ago, Levi will be forced 
to pay $12.25 million into a 
. ett lernen t hI n cI , Ovpr ~ 
quarter of the fund will be 
used to pay the Attorney 

It will be up to consumers 
and ultimately the San 
Francisco uperior Court on 
April 27 to deddethe fairness 
of the settlement. 

The defendant is Levi

. . ' 

Five dusty miles from the main road, at 
the end of a rolling, rutted brown trail that 
snaked across the vast mountain slope, the 
Virseo family had their farm. Three ragged 
buildings, wind·torn and splintered and 
white from the sun, huddled low against the 
land. Juan and his father and his two young 
sisters of twelve and fourteen, Sophia and 
Maura, lived together in the tiny wooden 
shack that was solid and dry inside but that 
listed slightly uphill from many years in the 
wind. 

Juan, a boy of seventeen, muscled, lean. 
with c\ose-cr!>pped waves of night·black 
hair, a hard chm and sparkling. purposeful 
brown eyes, went to school in the small town 
several miles down the main road. And at 
the side of hi~ fllther. lua., planted the corn 
and fed the animal and straightened the 
fences, and in t he nights, alone wit h the 
chirping of cricket , he read as long as he 
could until sleep brought the morning. 

In many ways, Juan was older than his 
years. Even as a very youngchild, he wanted 
to take action on his convictions. He wanted 
to act out the things he read in books and the 
thing he heard from the men in the town, 
things he perceived as valuable and that he 
thought would bring happiness to his life 
and tu the Ii e of others around him. 

He had heard t he men say that life is 
sometimes very frightening and very 
difficult. They would say. "Life is short and 
a man must make the most of it." And they 
would say, "Life is hard, and only t he strong 
man will endure." luan, impressed by the 
talk of the men, wished to work the things 
they said into his own life, to make their 
words breathe in hi daily activities. 

One summer's day. when the sun's heat 
came very fast off the tin roofs of the farm 
buildings, Quick·shimmering the trees and 
the clouds and the mountain boulders and 
making the air too hot for working, Sophia 
and Maura ran giggling to the barn to play 
with the new calf. Juan walked lazily to the 
fa · t, icy stream that ran in t he wood behind 
the shack. He removed his sandles and his 
loose shirt and his s hort , and, spreading 
himself on a large flat rock that s tuck out 
above the racingwater, he relaxed in the sun 
to think of many thin~s. 

"Juan!" His father s voice came from 
behind him, from somewhere in the trees. 

"Here, Papa! I am here ... at the s tream!" 
Juan 's father was short and si newy and 

the back of his neck was like t hick. brown. 
Quilt·sewn leather and he was very poor. Hi s 
face wa dark and deep·lined from the sun 
and his large hands were iron from many 
years of working the tools in t he field'. 
Above hard. square ch kbones. hi ' eyes 
were large and round and soft. almost like a 
deer's ey s, but they were not intelligent. 

Now, he walked from the trees into the

clearing, hi body bent slightly forward with 
age, but his head still held erect. The two 
smiled at each other.luan'sfather walked to 
the rock, and with a flat hand shaded his 
eyes from the sun, looked atjuan and said, 
"Come down from the rock. We must talk of · 
a very important thing." 

"But Papa. It is fun. I like to lay on the hot 
rock. J like the thinking." 

"I know you do, siJly boy," his father 
laughed. "Youth likes to do everything. But 
rww you must come ' down for I have 
something of great impoctance to tell you." 

Juan, puzzled by his fat her's solemn voice, 
jumped to the ground, grabbed his shirt and 
shorts, Quickly put them on , then sat with 
his father on the edge of the bank. Now and 
again their feet dipped Quickly into the icy 
stream and then held straight out over the 
water to dry in the sun a they talked. 

"Juan," his father began, speaking very 
slowly and very softly, "it i time for you to 
leave the mountain. You will fini h the high 
chool next month . Then you mus t leave." 
Juan looked quizzically at his father, his 

foot dripping clear cold water from the 
stream. "Leave? Leave. Papa? Why s hould I 
leave? We must work the farm, you and I. 
There is no reason for me to leave." 

"No, Juan. You must leave th farm 
forever. You' must go into the world. You 
must become a man . J love you wit h all that I 
have, but you are a boy. You mu t go. You 
must become a man ." He looked away from 
Juan as he said thi . 

Juan looked at the flas hing rocks in the 
stream. He SPOke slowly, purposefully. "I do 
not know what it is to bea man, Papa. There 
are many thing. I do not know." 

"It is time for you to learn. You must go." 
His voice was firm. but still soft. st ill slow. 

"What is it, Papa. to be this man you 
speak of?" 

"I cannot tell vou that. " 
"But whv. Papa? You are a man . Tell me 

how it IS that \ 'OU learned ." 
"There is n(l telling s uch a thing." Juan's 

father pushed himself up from the sand . " I

General and to cover 
administrative costs. The 
remainder will go to those 
Californians who purchased 
boys' and men's jean 
between 1971 and 1976. 

Sound like a good proposal? 
At first glance, perhaps. But 
upon a cia er look, the 
settlement is a hoax 
promising trivial relief to 
can umer . 

It all began when the 
Federal Trade Commission 
accu ed Levi of unlawfully 
forcing orne 15,000 clothing 
dealers to set prices for Levi 
products at an artificially 
high level. The FTC also 
claim d that the jeans maker 
coerced dealers who resisted 
and falsely informed them 
that the jeans were "fair· 
trade" products with prices 
fixed by law. 

Although not admitting 
guilt, Levi s igned an 
agreement 17 months later 
promisi ng not to price· fix in 
the fu ture. Several state 
attorney ~enerals, including 
California s, then filled anti· 
trust suits against Levi on 
the same grounds a the 
federal suit. 

Potential liability of Levi in 
California alone is about $318 
million . For some reason, 
however, Deukmejian 
decided to settle for a mere 3 
percent of that. 

Desiring to appear as a 
consumer advocate, Deuk· 
mejian at first wanted to 
Jlf!SOnally go on television to 
Inform Californians of the 
settlement. But he hastily 
withdrew his plan in the face 
of severe public criticism that 
his ad campaign was merely a 
media ploy to aid his expected 
candidacy for governor next 
year. 

An advertising agency, 
employed by Deukmejian, 
came up with a new plan. 
Notice would be sent out to 
all of California 's house-
holds informing them of the 
Attorney General's splendid 
work and the pot of money at 
the end of a claim form. 
Michael Landon would 
publicize the refund on 
television, thanking Deuk-
mejian for all his work. 

The settlement has been 
attacked by a number of 
public intere t and consumer 
groups for various reasons, 
none of which is revealed by 
Deukmejian's media cam· 
paign. 

First, the refund plan is 
meaningless and trivial. 
Whi le the Attorney General's 
notice claims that consumers 
will receive up to $2 for each 
pair of jeans purchased, this 
is simply not true. 

According to document · 
submitted to the San 
Francisco Superior Court. 
consumers could receive as 
litt Ie as 11 cents per pair of 
jeans. On the other hand , 
Deukmejian i ' the big 
winner. earning $1.2 million 
in attorney's fees for acasein 
which the Federal Trade 
Commission did most of the 
work.

women. The Attorney 
General wa appointed to 
represent all purchasers of all 
Levi products, and yet he 
refu ed to include women's 
jeans in the settlement. 

Third , the refund pro· 
cedure is an invasion of 
privacy si nce it require 
answer to orne very 
personal Questions. 

Last, the refund procedure 
affords no protection again t 
false claims. Even Deuk· 
mejian him elf has admitted 
that there cou ld be over 
300,000 fraudulent claim, 
and that he will be nearly 
powerle to prevent this . 
The real loser is the hone·t 
consumer who receives Ie s 
back becau e of the 
exaggerated number of 
claim. 

Con su mers think that 
there is a better way to 
di tribute the money . 
Something that will be more 
meaningful to the con umer 
than the candy money offered 
by Deukmejian' settlement. 
Their idea is the creat ion of a 
Consumer Trust Fund. 

The entire amount of the 
settlement would be 
deposited into the Trust 
Fund without having to 
deduct for administrative 
costs. Preventing future 
corporate price fixing would 
be the Trust Fund's sole 
purpose. 

With the initial deposit of 
the Levi settlement, the 
interest alone (as much as $1 
million annually) would be 
enough to sustain the Trust 
Fund indefinitely. 

Not only would the trust 
Fund's activities mean better 
Quality and safer products for 
the consumer dollar, but it 
would cause lower prices for 
some products through 
increased competition 
between companies. 

The Consumer Trust Fund 
has the upport of some tate 
officials , including State 
Department of Consumer 
Affairs Director Richard 
Spohn. Even Levi Straus ' 
does not oppose the idea. 

Although unprecedented in 
California, the fund is not a 
new idea. For example, Allied 
Chemical Corporation was 
fined four years for dumping 
toxic chemicals into a 
Virginia river. Out of the 
fines, totaling some $8 
million, came the creation of 
the Virginia Environmental 
Fund. Still going ·trong, the 
fund is used to protect 
Virginia's environment 
through toxic research and 
mediating environmental 
problems. 

Deukmejian criticizes the 
ConsumhTrust as being a 
windfall ' for public interest 
law groups. Not so. The fund 
would be independent of 
government. busine 's and 
public interest law firm~. 
The activities of the Trust 
Fund would, however, kick 
the Attorney General's office 
out of t he limelight. 

Directors oft he fund would 
be appointed by the 
Governor, Attorney General 
and consumer groups.

An epidemic: rape 
prevalent at UCSD 
12 assaults last quarter 
is more than one/week 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
AND WILLIAM HAMILTON 

Scaff Wrilers 

This is a campus at which 
almost half the people -
women - unknowingly face 
a constant and prevalent 
threat of rape, at which police 
are only beginning to admit 
that rape is a severe problem 
and at which funds for rape 

pr~vention programs are 
being cut. 

That is the picture that 
emerges from interviews 
with campus officials, 
concerned women and 
victims. 

The Campus Police 
Department disclosed last 
Friday that one actual rape 
and two attempted rapes 

-have been officially reported 
at UCSD in less than three 
weeks, the most recent 
attempt on March 21. 

In that instance, a tudent 
walking to her final exam 
was attacked on Warren at 
around 11:30 am by a man in 
the wooded area just north of 
Miramar Road, acrns the 
street from the campus 
police tat ion. 

The women was able to 
struggle free and run from 
her assailant when the police 
encountered her. By that 
time, however, her assailant 
disappeared. 

A second woman was 
assaulted and raped by two 
men on March 12 at 12:45 pm 
behind the Basic Science 
Building in parking lot 13-A. 
Again, the suspects escaped. 

')let another attempted 
. rape occured on March 18 atB 
pm in Muir Parking lot 2·B. 

And just last month a man 
attempted to rape a woman in 
the late afternoon at the 
University Events Office in 
the Student Center. 

Within the first three 
months of 1981 the total 
number of reported rapes at 
UCSD (one actual and three 
attempted) has exceeded the 
12-month figures recorded in 
recent years. The exception 
is 1979, in which one actual 
and three attempted rapes 
were reported. 

But these alarmingly high 
statistics do not account for 
the number of rapes which 
are unreported. One campu 
source who deals with rape at 
UCSD but asked to remain 
anonymous says that "there 
have been at lea t five rapes 
during this past month," and 
12 since January (about one 
per week). 

But the campus police. he 
said, have declined to di close 
the actual number !.If sexual 
assaults and attempted rape 
at UCSD, maintaining that 
publicizing the real extent of 
the problem would attract 
additional rapists here. 

Police detective Carol 
Parker dismissed thi as "the 
standard accu ation," and 
said that "it would be of no 
benefit to the police 
department to withholrl such 
information. " 

However, the Guardian 
has frequently been refused 
reque ts to the police 
department for campus 
police report s by using just 

r 
The Guardian 

that justification, news 
editor Jeff Beresford-Howe 
says. 

Parker did not deny the 
possibility of at least five 
attempted rapes in March, 
however. 

"There is no way of 
knowing how many rapes go 
unreported. The situation is 
often too delicate, too 
emotional and sometimes the 
victim may personally know 
the attacker and will decide 
not to report it," she said. 

And the police would 
appear to be concerned about 
the rising occurrence of 
sexual assault at UCSD. 
Following the rape at BSB, 
campus police Chief Hugh 
French issued a notI ce 
appraising UCSD staff that 
the attack had been reported , 
described the rapist · and 
requested information 
concern ing the identity of the 
assailants. 

The police also sponsored a 
seminar March 26, tW hile 
students were gone, entitled 
"Security for Women." A 
capacity crowd at the Med 
School's Garren Auditorium 
heard campus police offic~r 
Pamela Moes present general 
information concentrating on 
precaution women should 
take to increase their safety. 
including techniques to deter 
theft or vandali m and other 
measures considered effec· 
tive in reducing the potential

of being victimized by crime. 
While the talk skirted the 

issue of rape, that issue was 
clearly the overriding 
concern of the majority of 
those in attendance. When 
audience members began 
articulating their questions, 
the seminar rapidly turned 
into a rape prevention 
information session. 

One women who attended 
the seminar, the victim of a 
recent rape, told the 
Guardian that she was 
furious over the way the 
campus rape problem was 
"misrepresented and 
downplayed ... 

"Her (t he police officer's) 
presentation of the ituation 
wa inaccurate and poor," 
she said. "To pretend that 
this is a safe campus is 
misleading. It s hou ld be a 
mandatory function of the 
police to make this campu 
aware of what 's happening." 

But there appears to be a 
di s parit y between the . 
s tatistic the police feel 
comfortable with releasing 
and the reali ty of the 
situation. 

During the se minar, 
Officer Moes said that, "in 
the four year I've been here 
at UCSD there have only 
been two reported rapes on 
campu ." 

When a man in the 
audience inquired about "the 
six rffent assaults at the 

Monday, March 30, 19tH 

Mesa Apartments, " Moes' 
response was, "are you 
ta lking about the series 
involving the young 
blonde ... uh ... male suspect?" 

The man acquiesced. 
"That wasn t reported to 

us." 
In French's flyer, he states 

that, "The incidence of 
violent crime on campus is 
quite low. Nevertheless, it 
can and does happen on 
occasion. 

However, several staff 
members though t the 
discrepancy between offficial 
reports and reality may beget 
more and not less violent 
crime. 

Rather than encouraging

heard testimony on a bill that 
would permit military 
recruiters access to high 
school and college student 
records, but a vote on the 
measure was delayed 
because its author wants to 
wait until a conservative 
committee ally can be 
present. 

The bill has stirred debate 
because of fears that the 
information, even though 
already public, could find its 

_ way into the hands of the 
Selective Service in the event 
of a draft and be used to track 
down student who failed to

Rape is epidentic

Reaction is to cut rape 
prevention programs 
continued from page 4 
that police had been 
negligent. that they had 
actually known about rapes 
occuring on campus but had 
done nothing about it." 

RPEP is part of a UC 
systemwide program funded 
by fedetal grants from the 
Law Enforcement Assistance 
Administration. 

But the $9,000 in RPEP 
funds for each UC campus 
will be cut May 31, leaving 
each campus responsible for 
the program's continuance, 
Poole says. 

However, Poole, who also 
directs the RPEP program at 
UCSD, wasn't very disaJ> 
pointed about the budget cut, 
made in the last days of the 
Carter Administrat ion. 

The RPEP program at 
UCLA will be sustained by 
other budget sources. ''I've 
got a commitment from the 
:..ampus police for $10,000, 
and J've got another 
commitment from the vice 
chancellor of academic 
affairs for $10,000," she 
says. 

But at UCSD, RPEP 
Director Joan Koerper says 
she will not ask the campus 
police for any funds because 
she doesn't want the program 
operated "under the auspices 
of the police department." 

"If I accepted $10,000 from 
the police department, they 
would essentially be 
responsible for the program. 

It' all incredibly polit ical," 
s he said . 

"The goals of the two 
programs are very llifftl tM," 
she said. RPEP aims to 
prevent rape and protect 
people whereas the main goal 
of a police institution is to 
protect property, she said. 

But RPEP could be 
severely affected by losing 
the $9,000 which is spent 
mostly on staff salaries. 

"About three·fourthsof the 
money has gone towards 
salaries," she said. "Nobody 
will coordinate the program if 
the money is not there." 

Even $9,000 has not been 
enough to sustain a nine-to-
fivt: service or 24-hour 
hotline, she said. RPEP is 
staffed only by Koerper and 
one part· time tudent who 
works 10 hours a week. 

But Koerper is seeking 
funds from Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage, who has requested 
a doubling of Registration 
Fees for next year, but this 
would amount to only $4,000. 

Supplementary funds may 
also be reque ted from the 
Council of Provosts, Koerper 
said. 

Likewise, joe's Escort 
Service, an on-campus 
organization providing 
evening escorts for women, 
was forced to stop service last 
quarter. 

Randy Woodard , AS 
Advi or and member of the 

THIRD COLLEGE 
COMMUTERS: 

UCSD Rape Prevention 
Education Committee, is 
painfully aware of the 
budgetary restrictions which 
caused the demise of joe's. 

"To run adequate rape 
prevention and education 
programs, the financial 
burden mu t be shared," 
Woodard says. 

"What bothers me is the 
'let someone else fund it' 
attitude. Joe's was averaging 
about 25-30 calls per week, 
but the escort served solel y 
on a volunteer ba is. 

"The AS just couldn't 
afford to fund it. In order to ' 
reinstitute the ervice, we 
would need $10,000 for 
paying an adequate staff, 
walky-talkies and operating 
costs. No si ngle funding 
source can adequately fund 
the ervice this campus 
needs. It will increa ' ingly 
become nece sary to look 
around for multiple sources 
of funding." 

At UCLA, the e cort 
service is run by the campus 
police department, which 
pays $125,000 annually to 
pay escorts and keep the 
service running. There has 
been one succe ful rape at

a many students as UCSD. 
Reports of an alarming 

increase in rapes at UCSD, 
the lack of funding to us tain 
education and prevention 
organizations and the recent 
demise of joe's Escort Service 
paints a bleak picture for the 
future . 

And there is no indication 
that there has been or will be 
an abatement of exual 
harassment at UCSD. 

There have been frequent 
reports of sexual harrass-
ment at Central Library, 
according to library 
admini s trator Alvina 
Robertson. 

"At least once a month a 
student will report 'annoying 
glances' or 'exhibitionism' on 
the upper floor of the Ii brary 
where no taU members are 
present," she said . 

Similar incidents ha ve 
been reported in the campus 
dormitorie as well. One 
Muir hou e advisor said she 
knew of two recent instances 
where women were ap· 
proached by a man a they 
walked from their cars to 
Tioga Hall. In one of these 
case, the man wa armed 
with a gun. 

She also told of a eries of 
threatening phone ca ll s 
received by dormitory 

residents. 
••• 

So w hat can be done to end 
the fear and trauma caused 
by the proliferating numbers 
of attacks on UCSD women? 

How can funding be found 
for services like joe's? What 
is the contribution to the 
problem of the di s mal 
campus lighting, and what 
can be done about it? 

What are the chances of a 
coherent police campaign to 
combat rape? 

And what are the 
psychological and physical 
effect of the epidemic, on 
both the women who are 
attacked and on women who 
must fear for their safety? 

What are women's groups 
doing with rape, before and 
after it happens? 

Tho e questions wi ll be 
addre sed in further 
Guardian article on the 
ubject in the next two 

weeks. 
Unfortunately, the pm-

blem will be here longer than 
that. How serious it remains 
will depend on the willing-
ness of the campus to help it 
own.

Saxon will take 3-
month leave in fall 
Will hang out at Oxford; 
no course of study known 
uc President David 

Saxon will take a three-
month leave of absence as 
UC President because of 
his election as a Visiting 
Research Fellow to Merton 
College of Oxford Univer-
sity. En~l~md. 

Saxon s fellowship is for 
the coming Michaelmas 
(fall) term. According to 
CSG Phillips. acting 
warden of Merton College. 
the fellowship " provides 
an opportunity for 
distinguished visitors to 
Oxford to become more 
clo ely involved in the 
general life of the 
academic community." 

Saxon's election was 
hailed by Joseph A. Moore. 
chairman of the UC Board 
of Regent s. as "a 
significant honor both for 
David Saxon and for the 
University of California. 

"I am delighted that 
President Saxon will have 
an opportunity to get away 
from the daily demands of 
the University presidency, 
and to refresh himself," 
Moore said. 

"Oxford . with its 
scholarly atmosphere. and 
Merton as the oldest of 
Oxford's colleges . will 
provide the most ideal 
setting possible for 
reflecton and careful 
contemplation of impor-
tant issues facing higher 

David Saxon 

education right now and in 
the foreseeable future." 

The fellowship involves 
no formal duties and is 
without pay. 

While Saxon is gone, UC 
will have a definite lack of 
experienced leadership at 
the top. 

Academic Affairs Vice 
Chancellor Donald Swain 
is leaving permanently for 
the presidency of the 
University of Louisville. 
and Budget Vice President 
Thomas Jenkins has 
retired. 

And there are new 
chancellors at Berkeley 
and UCSD.

S begins gearing up for 
this quarter's elections 

Petitions available, due this week 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Staff Writer 
It's election time again at UCSD. 
Beginning today . theAS is making available 

"intent of candidacy" forms at the AS office in 
the Student Center. 

All candidates must file those forms. which 
request the student's name. addres • phone 
number. status. coJlege. GPA and a lOO-word 
statement of intent. by 4:30 pm. April 6. 

Campaigning will begin April 7 and will 
continue through the elections, to be held 
April 22 and 23. 

Candidates for all posts except AS president 
must gather 25 student s ignatures to be 
eligible for the ballot. Presiden tia l contenders 
must submit 40 s ignatures. 

Candidates for the nine commis ioner pot 
(academic affairs. activity fee. appointments 
and evaluations. communication • elections. 
external affairs. programming. public 
relations and student welfare). vice president 
and president may spend up to $50 on their 
campaigns. 

Students running for college representative 
spots on the council (each coJlege has three) 
may spend 00 more than $25. according to the 
AS Election Codes. 

Violators of these codes. which remain 
unchanged from last year. will be subject to 
review by the Elections Board if a complaint is 
filed against them. The board handled a 
number of grievances last year. including 
those made about illegal posting. poster 
content and other infractions. 

All candidates. including those for college 
government positions. must attend an 
instrucitonal meeting tentatively schedules 
fot April 6 at 4:30 pm in the North Conference 
Room Of the Student Center. The basic 
structure. functions and authority of the AS 
and of the election codes will be discus edt as 
well as any questions candidates may have. 

Ballot placement for students running for 
AS Council positions wi\1 then be determined 

by lottery. 
Campus-wide office are decided b~ a 

majority (50 percent plus one) of those votmg. 
If no majority if received after the results of 
the elections are determined. the two 
candidates with the mo t votes will compete in 
a run-off on Tuesday of the s ixth week of the 
quart,er. . 

Tl;e individual with the most votes m the 
run-off election wins. 

La t year. a large field. including eight 
candidates for AS president. produced run-
oijs for ix offices. 

Jeremy Charlton led a sweep by the "Very 
Silly Students" slate. defeating Linda Sabo by 
35 votes in the run-off for pre ident. Charlton 
later resi~ed during fall quarter. allowing 
vice preSident Bill Topkis to step up to 
president. and initiating a wave of 
resignations by Council members that totaled 
nine by February. 

Two other silly slate students. Meg Honda 
and Todd Thomp on. won in run·ofts. filling 
the public relations and activity fee 
commissionerships respectively. 

Honda. who attracted the largest number of 
voters (704) in the run-oft election. resigned 
soon after she was named to her post. And 
Thompson. who won by a narrow margin over 
Jules Bagneris. is the only one of the four 
elected silly students to complete his tenure on 
the AS Council. 

The only change in the elections procedure 
this year is in polling mechanics. AS officials 
say. 

Voting will be done on a "votamatic" 
machine. provided by the San Diego Registrar 
of Voters. Polling booths and computer time to 
tabulate the election results will also be 
donated uy the Registrar. reducing election 
costs by an estimated $1.200 .. 

The AS will still pick up the tab for the 
printing of balIots and labor costs.

A warning: woman 
describes her rape 

'1 just thought. .. God 
damo, I'm dirty.' 

BY WILLIAM HAMILTON 
lalf Writer 

Camille (not her name) is a 
UCSD rape victim. 

She wa accosted in broad 
daylight in a UCSD parking 
lot, violently raped and 
beaten. Her tory is a painful 
testament to the everity of 
the univer sity' rape 
problem. 

The trauma of rape linger 
tar beyond the aftermath of 
the attack, stigmatizing the 
victim, confusing and 
upsetting her friends, family 
and peers, who are often 
unaware that peer upport is 
essential in facilitating the 
victim's recovery. 

She ha come forward to 
help warn women at UCSD 
that rape can happen. 

"I walked through the 
parking lot to get into my car. 
There were people milling 
about, so I wasn't particu-
larly watchful. 

"Suddenly, in mid·stride I 
felt a huge hand over my 
mouth, cutting off my 
breathing. I thought [ was 
going to die. The a sailant 
put an arm around me 
pinning my arms to my side, 
and picked me up like a little 
kid. He swung me around, 
and ) saw a second guy 
coming at me_ 

" I kicked the second guy 
hard. He hit me in the mouth, 

and the first attacker s lung 
me to the ground. They 
kicked me in the kidneys and 
in the back. 

I have no memory after 
that point, although some i 
returning slow ly. 

"All r remember doing 
after it was over is 
·traightening my elf up and 
getting into my car, 
di oriented, trying to button 
my blouse but not being able 
to because the button were 
gone. ( didn't think of 
em barra ment; I just 
thouKht, 'nothing happened' 
and 'God damn ... I'm dirty.' I 
felt incredibly dirty . 

"As oon as I got home I 
stripped off my clothes and 
took a shower to try to get 
clean. I threw my clothes into 
the washing machine. 

"I got dres ed again and 
went through the motions of 
ret urning to work. On the 
way back to my office [ 
passed two different men 
along the s idewalk and 
uddenly began shaking. 

When ( got to work my 
supervisor looked at me and 
asked me if I was all right . 

"At that point I broke down 
with the realization of what 
had happened and called the 
police. 

"People don 't know how to 

'li n ' 'HIT 
The Guardian 

handle rape. When I poke to 
the police on the phone [ told 
them that it was an 
attempted rape becau e I 
didn't want to cause a big 
commotion. By that time, I 
was crying and shaking. The 
cop on the phone asked me if I 
could come down to th 
station, and ( ju t thought, 
, No! Are you kidding.' told 
him 'No,' and asked them to 
please be discreet when they 
came over. 

"The officer came in the 
front door of the office and 
said "I heard there was an 
attempted rape," in the 
middle of the mezzanine. 

"They weren't at all 
discreet and one secretary 
said, "Listen... be consi-
derate ... " At this time, i was 
going into shock, although I 
was a lso beginning to feel the 
physical pain of the assault. 

"Then I told t he police that 
it was a full rape. 

''The police meant well, 
and they were efficient. They 
were completely sympathetic 
and understanding. Non -
condemning. 

"Following the interview, 
arrangements were made to 
take me home. I passed out 
twice waiting for a ride. 

When I got home, there were 
signs of internal bleeding. 
But I didn't want to go to the 
ho pital - I just didn't want 
to be touched. 

"Over the next couple of 
days I wa treated by doctors. 
Our family doctor prescribed 
the morning-afterpill. since [ 
didn't have any other birth 
control and other medication 
and J wa X-rayed for 
internal damage." 

(She sustained kidney and 
liver damage and a chipped 
vertebrae as a result of the 
beating.) 

''I'm in therapy now," she 
say . "Your self-worth is shot 
to hell after this kind of an 
ordeal. You think, 'Why me? 
What did I do?' 

"You wonder - is it going 
to happen again - and 
become afraid to be alone. 
anywhere. " 

Camille has adopted some 
firm idea about the manner 
in which rape victims should 
react. 

"If you are raped. call the 
police and eek medical aid, 
both physical and mental. 
Women have got to become 
aware that this crime can 
happen to them , and that it 
doe happen on this campu .

'h 
Don't walk around being 
constantly afraid, but be 
aware that t his is happening, 
here and now," he said. 

Camille plans to enroll in 
both chemica l (mace) and 
phy ical self-defensecour es, 
and says s he would definitely 
carry mace under the proper 
circumstances. 

Neither mace nor self-
defense i necessarily a 
deterrent to an attack, 
however, especially one in 
which the as ailant has a 
weapon. 

" If you are attacked, don't 
feel ashamed if you can't 
scream or fight back - the 
main thing is to come out 
alive - because you sure as 
hell aren't comin~ out of it 
with your dignity. '

Ampfiitlieater project dead 
BY JOHN BRICE 

Staff Writer 
"Building an amphithea-

ter, a long and difficult 
process so far, is not likely to 
get any easier," began a Nov. 
13, 1979 Guardian article. 

That appears to be a 
understatement vis-a-vis 
Chuck Powers' recent 
comment that the amphi-
theater project is "dead: 

Powers, a campus planner 
who headed the project, 
seems to have put an end to 
six years of discussion about 
an outdoor amphitheater 
projected to have a seating 
capacity of 5,000. 

"The amphitheater hoped 
to host top-name entertain-
ment that the campus is now 
having difficulty attracting, 
due to a lack of adequate 
facilities," says Bruce 
Pearso n of University 
Events. 

Under the direction of 
former UEO director Diane 
Annala and last year's AS 
President Carlos Montalvo, 
the Amphitheater Planning 
Committee presented a plan 
that grew to a scale that 
Powers considered "unrea-
li stic." Montalvo said in 1979 
that he wanted to see an 
amphitheater that would 
seat 5,000, with permanent 
seats and a stage. He 
approximated the cost at 
$500,000. 

At that time, Powers said a 
project of that nature would 
co t as much as $2 million. 

The original plan was 

Scale of project, like a dinosaur ~ killed it 
much simpler than the open-
air amphitheater proposal, 
presented in February of 
1980. 

"( was thinking in terms of 
a grassy bowl, a very low-cost 
project," Powers says. He 
explains that the bowl could 
be created by dumping soil 
into one of the ravines on 
campus. 

(The medical school sits on 
land-fill from the construc-
tion of Interstate 5). 

The amphitheater project 
was to be funded by 
donations from the commu-
nity and by the Alumni and 
Development Association on 
campus. 

Ray Ramseyer, spokesman 
for the association, said in 
October 1979 that his office 
would help secure funds for 
the project once the site had 
been approved. 

Since that time, no site has 
been selected and, according 
to Powers, "there is no 
funding or funding sources." 

Ramseyer said recently 
that "there is such a need for 
a facility like that on campus 
for a social out let." And , he 
added, an outdoor facility 
would be much more 
economically feasible and 
would accomodate a larger 
number of students than an 
indoor facility. 

"There has been no 
development with the 
funding," Ramseyer says. ") 
was approached by a couple 
st udent groups with 
fundraising projects but 

nothing ever came of them. 
"It's hard to ignite our 

students for a single major 
project . If (the amphitheater) 
will only be realized as the 
result of student effort. 
There are only a couple dozen 
students who get that 
involved," says Ramseyer. 

AS President Bill Topkis 
agrees, sayin~ that, "the 
amphitheater project is 
somewhat unrealistic." 

wonder what happened to the 
$5,000," Pearson ays. 

He was referring to the 
money that last spring came 
out of the Chancellor's 
Discretionary fund for sound 
tests at pr.oposed sites for the 
amphitheater. 

Powers feels that "there 
are several ot her projects of 
higher priority." He cites the 
cancer research center and a 
multi-purpose student 
facility as examples. 

Topkis sees the recreation 
faci Ii ties proposed for 
Warren campus as more 
important, since students 
last year already passed a 
referendum to fund the 
project . 

But the tests never were 
performed. 

Powers, who has the 
money, says "It's still in its 
account; I may give it back to 
the Chancellor, as the project 
appears to have no future." 

Pearson is disturbed by 
Powers' news of "the dead 
amphitheater project." 

"If that is true it's too bad. I 

'I amnesty' approved 
Students with lapsed [ncompletes will be 

able to make up their course work. 
The Academic Senate lastTuesday voted to 

issue an "amnesty" to all students who have 
allowed their Incompletes to lap e beyond one 
quarter. 

The grading reprieve, finalized after 
months of controversy and committee debate, 
applies to both undergraduates and graduate 
students who e [ncompletes have lapsed to Fs. 

These students wilt" now have until the end 
of next fall quarter to make up course work, 
with the permission of their instructor and 
college provost. 

However, the amnesty does not apply to 
(ncompletes that expire after this or any 
subsequent quarter. 

John Alksne, who chaired the Senate 
meeting, said there was "no problem" 
approving the proposed amnesty and called it 
"the only reasonable compromise" available 

to the faculty body. 
Between 70 and 100 faculty members 

showed up for the spring lx-eak meeting, 
despite predictions that a necessary quorum of 
50 would not be reached and final decision on 
the amnesty would be further postponed. 

The Senate's decision followed closely the 
rever al to letter grades of eight Fs - six the 
result of lapsed [ncompletes - to 
undergraduate Montgomery Reed. 

The grades, originally lapsed Incompletes 
that were given letter grades, were changed 
back to Fs at the request of Third College 
Provost Joseph Watson, who argued that 
UCSD's grading policy prohibited Reed from 
making up his Incompletes. 

In the wake of controversy surrounding 
Reed's grades, the Committee on Educational 
Policy is . considering making UCSD's 
Incomplete policy more lenient by extending 
the one-quarter deadline. 

r Here's what accreditation team I~ader J<?~n Milton said about UCSD duringl I hiS last VISit: 
That hath thy aaft, 

By mixing somewhat true to vent more lIa. 
But what hath been thy answers, what but dark, 
Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding'· 

But Milton also said that students can be a part of 
taki ng the University from those who are content 
to let it rest as a human overflow lot for Berkeley 

or a Valley vacation home. 

Write for The Guardian and expose the selfish 
and the greedy. 

And, there's room for those who want to write 
about good things peculiar to UCSD - students 
who graduate in 2 years, professors on the edge 
of discovery, and people all over the campus 
who take seriously their commitment -to 

improving the quality of life and education, 

Call Jeff Beresford-Howe at The Guardian

shake things up, make (a little) money, or just be

Brown will fight for seat 
Says racism is causing him to fight to keep Regent's post 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacram e nlO Correspondent 

No one envie t he task before the 
five state sen tators w ho will meet 
next month to cons ider w hether 
Willie Lewis Brown, Jr., shou ld 
become a UC regent for _the next 12 
years. 

When they convene, t hey will face a 
peculiar political hot potato that has 
never before confronted either t he 
Legis lature or the University. 

enemies. 
Gov. Brown named Speaker Brown 

to the board, for one thing. to gain an 
ally in th fight to force the Regents to 
vote to sever tie with t he two nuclear 
weapons laboratories UC operates for 
the federal government. 

The governor a lso wanted to name a 
Black regent to the board and. 
according to some reports, picked his 
friend Willie Brown to avoid 
appointing San Francisco's Dr . 
Carlton Goodlett. 

his ex officio seat next year were he to 
give up the appointed eat. 

Fueling t he confusion. the two most 
authoritative source on the state' 
lega l affa ir have plit harply over 
the legalit y of Brown 's nomination. 

Attornev General George 
D ukm jian found last month that it 
would be unconst itut ional for Brown 
as a legislator to accept thegovernor's 
offer. 

Deukmejian cited a paragrah of the 
constitution that says, "No member of 

weighty issues such as bills and 
appointments. says the const itution 
never m ant to unilaterally prevent a 
legislator from becoming a regent. so 
long a the legislator derives no -
personal gain from the position. 

Gregory's IS-page opinion states. 
"We do not think the appointment by 
the governor oj a legi lator to the 
board pre ent s the danger sought to be 
prohibited ... by the const itution." 

The thorny issue revolves around 
wh ther or not a fellow legi lator. the 
flamboyant 46-year-o ld Bla ck 
Democratic Speaker of the A sembly, 
can legally be named to serve on the 
UC Board of Regents until 1992 in 
apparen t v iolation of t he state 
con titution. 

News analysis 

For good measure, UC General 
Cou n el Donald Reidhaar has tos'ed 
his opinion into the hopper. too, and 
says Brown must now vacate his 
appoin ted po ition and let the 
governor name someone el e. 

The dilemma is two-fold , touching 
not only on theconst itutionalityofthe 
appointment but muddied al 0 by 
Brown's recent acquisition of another, 
ex officio. seat on the board that he got 
by becoming peaker. 

One thing about the sticky matter 
seems clear enough, however: Willie 
Brown dearly want to be a full -time 
regent , with all the attendant prest ige 
and privilege that t he po t bring. 

That wa evident recent ly at a 
Capitol press conference when Brown 
emotionall y la hed out at critic of his 
appOintment. Then. he vowed to 
pursue the regent 's seat even if it 
ultimately means a court challenge by 
hi opponent , as he predicts it will. 

He implied that the swelling 
controversy over hi s nomination is 
racist and that opposition s tems from 
"t hose who hold tremendou s 
re entment against me," but did not 
name anyone in particular. It is no 
s ecret that Assem bly speakers 
traditionally have long lists of 

Goodlett. a controver ial phy ician-
businessman-publis her. is probably 
the most influential Black political 
figure in the Bay Area short of Brown 
himself. 

Brown is only the second Black 
named to the board. 

The major di pute over Brown as a 
legis lator-cum-regen t. unprecedented 
in the 1 13-year history of the Board of 
Regents. ari e from Brown's dogged 
refusal to give up the long term seat, 
which he call "a very valuable 
commodity ," now that he has become 
speaker and holds the ex officio 
po ition . 

There are currently eight ex officio 
seats on the 26-member board 
awarded to variou state a nd 
univers ity offi cials. Those seats are 
temporary, lasting only as long as the 
individual holds onto his other 
position. 

In the arena of state politics. the 
Assembly speakership, while the 
second most powerful office. is one of 
the most tenuous. Changing political 
winds could biow Brown right out of

the Legi lature may, during the term 
for which t he member i elected, hold 
any office or employment under t he 
tate ot her than an elective office." 

The Board of Regents, Deukmejian 
says, fa ll s in to tha category. 

A cording to Deukmejian, the 
con titution eek to guard again t a 
legislator's po s ible co nflict of 
interest or the "opportunity for 
pr ivate aggrandizement," w het her or 
not for money. 

He argue that a seat on t he Board of 
Regents cou ld be grant ed as a reward 
to a legi lator who has been 
particu la rl y helpful to the governor. 

The attorney general's opinion 
carries more legal clout t han any 
decis ion hort of a court ruling. There 
has never been a court ca e to test t he 
quest ion. 

At the ame time. Brown and hi 
s upporter s can rally around 
Legis lative Counsel Bion Gregory's 
oppos ite finding that the peaker can 
indeed be seated as a 12·year regent. 

Gregory's office. with its legions of 
attorneys who advise lawmakers on 

Because of the unusual turn of 
events that has found Brown holding 
two seats at the arne t ime. some 
n ewspapers have ridic1ll ed the 
pos ibility that he could technically 
have two vote on the board. But 
Reidhaar dismi ses t hat unlikely 
event. 

rt is believed that Brown wants 
discretion over w ho would fill the ex 
officio position he would relinquish 
when the Senat e confirms him . which 
seems likelyat this poinL He could a k 
that an Frans i co Democrat Leo 
McCarthy, who preceded Brown as 
speaker, be given the spot. 

Still . it is considered an unhealthy 
political move - not to mention rude 
- to vote aga in '( the leader of the 
other house, especially if he is a 
mem her of your own party, regardless 
of an attorney general' opinion. 

The Assembly speaker ha vast 
power over nearly every legislative 
matter in Sacramento. either directly 
in his own house or indirectly in the 
other, s ince all bills are heard by both 
houses.

Portrait Photography 
Portrait , or people photography is 

an intimate business. There are 
people for whom photography is an 
intimate business. There are people 
who just can't get close enough to get 
a "close up," so they buy long lenses 
and shoot pictures that look more like 
Henri Cartier Brisson, the master of 
the "decisive moment" but not 
nationally known as a portrait 
photographer. Few people know that 
Ansel Adams has taken beautiful 
portraits. Richard Avedon takes cold, 
laid bare, but striking portraits. 
Stieglitz's images of Georgia O'Keeffe 
showed the most subtle nuances of 
feeling, and show a deeply intense 
relationship. The art of portraiture is 
self·revealing since a little bit of the 
photographer always shows in the 
image. A picture is a portait by its 
intent, not by serendipity. 

This class will help the student whp 
wants to work professionally, or just 
take pictures of their friends and 
families, to do it better and with more 
confidence. All of the work will be 
done in black and white, using 
available light. 

Please lJring your cameras and Tn· 
X 400 ASA film to the first meeting. 

Intermediate Photography 
This class is designed for those 

students who have already completed 
a beginning class, or who have had 
enough experience in the field who 
feel they would be better off at this 
level. The major learning experience 
in photography is in the actual 
shooting, and this is a working class 
where we bring our cameras to each 
meeting. The second major learning 
experience in photography is begun in 
contact with other students, and the 
sharing of ideas that result . The 
emphasis will be on expanding the 
ability to see and produce more 
sophisticated photographic images. 
The technical information basic to 
increaSing and refining primary 
photographic skill will be stressed. 
Individual attention will be to each 
student. All work will be done in black 
and white, with emphasis on available 
light. The Crafts Center darkroom is 
available to all students in this class. 
One field trip is planned at the end of 
the quarter. 

Please bring one proof sheet and 
two 8x 10 images to the first meeting 
along with YQUr camera loaded with 
Tri·X 400 ASA film. 

Disc:o\lering Calligraphy II 
This calligraphy class is for the 

stud nt with some background in 
beautiful writing who wants to 
improve his/ her skills. The emphasis 
will be on those areas in which the 
student wants to apply calligraphy; 
cards, flyers , banners. A general 
review of the italic hand, materials and 
layout will be covered followed by 
more indepth instruction in other 
hands (crucial , ca rolingian) . The 
history and use of manuscripts and 
calligrap hy from Roman to 
contemporary times will be discussed .. 
Students will work on weekly 
assignments and an exhibit of 
everyone's work will be held the last 
class. Bring ink , pens and paper to first 
class meeting. Note : Students will be 
eligible to display or sell their works in 
the Crafts Center Spring Crafts Sale 
to be held June 2, 3, 4. 9 weeks. 
Prerequisite : Some previous 
experience with calligraphy.

Handwriting Analysis : The 
First Eight Steps 

Why don't Robert and .Jdlle get 
along? Why does Sally prefer studying 
to socializing? Why would Bill rather 
work on his car than analyze math 
problems? The answer may lie in their 
handwriting: does Robert write tiny, 
while Jane has large script ? Does Sally 
make pointed m's while Bill makes 
rounded ones? Many aspects of the 
personality can be understood by 
counting and evaluating the individual 
strokes of a person's handwriting: 
emotional responsiveness; thinking 
patterns; natural abilities ; social 
adaptability. Handwriting is the result 
of neurological impulses from the 
brain to the muscles of the hand and 
arm, and is unique to each individual. 
Graphoanalysis, the system which will 
be introduced in this course , is a 
scient ific system of hCtrldwrit ing 
analysis, based on more than 52 years 
of clinical and empirical research. 

The students will be able to 
immediately apply the basic steps of 
Graphoanaiysis as they are 
introduced. Aspec ts of the personality 
as well as uses for Graphoanalysis 
such as counseling , personnel 
selection, or vocational guidance will 
be covered. Note: no visitors or 
material refund after the first class. 6 
weeks. Materials fee: $12, includes 
text and handouts,

Brown says opponents are 'racist' 
l"ontinu{'d (rom paj.l{' ,) 

The Senate Rules Committee, 
comprised of three liberal Democrats, 
David Roberti of Los Angele , Nick 
Petris from Oakland and Barry Keene, 
from Eureka, and two Republican, 
Ray Johnson, from Chico and William 
Craven, representing Oceanside, is 
not expected to give Brown any bad 
news. 

recent memory has been turned down 
by a rules committee, although some, 
such as Los Angeles bu ine sman and 
ACLU Director Stanley K. 
Shein baum, have undergone rigorous 
grilling from enator.

and be on t he receiving end in anot her. 

chain, which Brown listed as one of 
five clients paying the legislator more 
than $10,000 in 1980, according to 
documents filed with the Fair Political 
Practices Commission this month. 

[n fact, Craven heaped praise on 
Brown. 

h[ think Willie would be good at 
whatever he wants to do," Craven 
said. "He's erudite, enthusiastic and 
would probably make a terrific 
regent." 

"The question in everybody's mind 
seems to be whether Brown would be 
voting on an issue a the speaker of 
the Assembly or as a 12·year member 
of the Board of Regents," said UC 
Student Lobby Co·director Paul 
Rogers . 

Yet, the speaker, governor, 
lieutenant governor and public 
schools s uperintendent are all 
guaranteed ex officio seats in spite of 
their undeniable political connections, 
and their votes count the same a 
vote of appointed members. 

In what might be construed as 
another kind of potential conflict for 
Brown, who maintains a lucrative law 
practice in San Francisco, one of his 
biggest clients in another UC regent. 

Brown told reporters last week that 
there has been "clear precedent" for 
elected officials to erve as regents, 
including judg~s and county 
supervisors. 

Marjorie Woolman, longtime 
secretary to the Board of Regents, said 
one regent was appointed a superior 
court judge while serving on the 
board. Another served in an ex officio 
capacity while he was president of the 
university alumni association, 
according to Woolman. So far, no governor's appointee in 

Since the University of California 
receives all of its operating budget 
from the state, it might seem a curious 
conflict for Willie Brown to be voting 

Edward Carter, the ranking mem-
ber of the regents, is chairman of the

··Military access to UC? 
continued from page 5 
prohibit high schools and 
colleges in California from 
refusing to allow recruiters 
from the National guard , the 
Army and other branches of 
the armed services access to 
student directory informa-
tion for recruiting purposes. 

The UC campuses, 
including UCSD, publish 
pu blic student directories, 
but UC officials oppose the 
bill, as well as the American 
Civil Libertie Union and the 
UC Student Lobby. 

Before Schmitz made hi 
bid to hold over the meas ure 
pending a friendlier political 
atmo phere, he brought in a 
group of uniformed military 
officers who testified that 
recruiting is going poorly and 
that a bill to allow them 
better acce to potential 
recruits would give a much-

needed boost. . 
"J have observed that all-

volunteer armed forces are 
simply not going to work," 
Schmitz said. ''I'd just as 
soon go to a draft - it's 
cheaper, easier - but this 
legislation could stave that 
off as long as possible." 

"Senator, if you were a 
member of a pacifist family , 
would you want your name 
given out?" asked Sen. Diane 
Watson , D-Los Angeles. 
"Why s hould we inflict this 
mandate on ( tudent )?" 

Schmitz. a colonel in the 
Marine Reserve, said he 
worrie t hat you ng people are 
getting "a com pletely 
di storted" view of the 
military and want re-
cruiters to be able to engage 
in a direct mail campaign to 
find new recruits. 

To do that, Schmitz 
argued, it is necessary to 
have ready access to names 
and addresses of students. 

Much of the discussion 
centered less on any potential 
threat to a student's privacy 
than on concern that the 
proposed legislation would 
take away local control over 
relea e of student informa-
tion. 

"[ fully support the 
principle of your bill ," said 
Speraw, "but I'll have to vote 
against it becau eof the local 
control que t ion." 

State law a written now 
allows hi~h chool and 
college offtcials to decide 
whether it would be in t he 
best interests of the school 
and the individual to relea e 
information to a particular 
group or agency. even if the 

student has said it may be 
made pu blic. 

No information would be 
given out to anyone if the 
individual s pecifically 
requests that it not be. 

Schmitz called the local 
control issue "a red herring." 

Marine Maj. Larry Parsons 
told the committee that 10 to 
15 percent of school boards 
across the state at present 
decline to allow military 
recruiters access to the 
student lists . 

Watson said the bill would 
set a bad precedent. 

" I trongly feel that a Ii t of 
students is for educational 
purpose only." s he said. 
"Why s hould we expo e high 
school s tudents to scrutiny 
by out ide agencies?" 

The bill will probably be 
rescheduled for another 
hearing in April. 

Land sale 
limited? 

Assemblyman Law-
rence Kapiloff (D-San 
Diego) has introduced a 
bill which will place 
restrictions on the sale of

SjJiii!g Season '81 
Hartford Ballet 

In the eight years since its beginnings as an 
outgrowth of the School of the Hartford Ballet, the 
Hutford Ballet eolllpllllY has become one of 
America's most succe&5ful and widely touring ballet 
compenies. 

Artistic director Michael Uthoff, a native of Chile, 
danced with both the Joffrey Ballet and the Jose Limon 
Dance Company before joining the Hartford in 1972. 
Uthoff is cOn5idered to be one of the most gifted young 
choreographers today. His style is essentially balletic, 
though it has a strong admixture of modern technique. 
His works are poetic and compelling: ranging from the 
boldness, weightiness and lucid canonic patterns 
reminiscent of Limon to light, shadowy and enigmatic 
suites. 

Dancers include former members of the New York 
City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, San Francisco 
Ballet, Stuttgart, Joffrey and Royal Winnipeg 
companies 

The program includes: 
Allepo BriI&a.te (1956) 
Choreographed by George Balanc hine. Music by 
Tchaikovsky (Concerto No. 3 for Piano) . 
0.0 (1974) 
Choreographed by Michael Uthoff. Music by Rusti

An [vening of Song 
and Story 
Garthwaite, Sorrels, & Hawkins 

An E",e.ing of Song & Story is a mixture of 
music and poetry, of the familiar and the unfamiliar, of 
the spirit of urban and rural America, feat uring 
singer/ songwriters Terry Garthwaite and Rosalie 
Sorrels, and poet/ writer Bobbie Louise Hawkins. 

Garthwaite transcends her Joy oj Cooking days 
(Cooking was a female-led band in the late 60's and 
early 70's) - she is an accomplished guitarist and 
songwriter, and a stirring vocalist. Sorrels is a walking 
traditional songbook with a strong voice and 
completely unpretentious manner. Hawkins is a poet 
and writer with familial roots in West Texas and 
professional roots in the art world. She gives stunningly 
evocative readings from her four books - works 
deeply embedded in the place and personality of the 
rural American West. 

The subject of the first piece of the evening is a 
spontaneous decision that sparks themes which 
determine the direction and character of the rest of the 
performance. Each women established a personality 
and rhythm of performance that complement s and 
enhances what her two fellow performers do. Being 
with thse three women is like spending an evening with 
strangers who rapidly break through the wall between 
artist and audience and become friends . By the end of 
the evening you are left with many magical moments 
and a wonderful glow that only the most involVing 
performers can bestow.

by John Gay 

"DMraioB. &: D .... t." is a one· man tour de 
force featuring two remarkable men: one is Britain's 
notorious wit, playwright , poet, genius and wag, Oscar 
Wilde; the other is one of the world's most beloved 
stars of stage and screen, a connoisseur of fine art, 
cuisine and the macabre - Vincent Price. 

Price portrays Wilde at the end of his career. He has 
been exiled from England and is giving a lecture in an 
old concert hall ·in Paris. Here the author of "The 
Importance of Being Earnest" and "Picture of Dorian 
Gray" offers observations on a variety of subjects with 
the sparkling, incisive wit that earned him a reputation 
as the world's greatest master of the "art of 
conversation in the English-speaking world.'" 

"Diversions & Delights" has enthralled audiences 
and critics across the country. 
"It's an utter spellbinder!"

"My name' .Li a. What's 

yours?" she asked and tossed 
back a wisp of blond hair. 

"Juan," he said, as evenly 
and as dryly as pos ible. 

On Tolbert 
~ HlIlIJHI, d 11'0111 p . I J...:\ :.: 
as all others; all of man 
think and feels these 
strange things." 

Juan thought he knew of 
what hi father was 
s peaking, but he was not 
sure. 

Juan went to the war. He 
had read in books that it is a 
ilia II w hu fighl · fur his 
beliefs. But when he was 
fighting,Juan did not thinkof 
beliefs, but only of fear. And 
he learned that the ones who 
mo t wanted to fight had the 
fewe t beliefs. I do not want 
to be a man this way, Juan 
thought. And he was very 
lonely. 

Juan left the war and 
slarted a business, thinking 
that money and power and 
prestige would make him a 
man, like in some books he 
read , and that he would be 
loved and happy. He became 
wealthy and powerful and 
prestigtous and more hated 
by others around him . 
Surely, he thought, there is 
more to being a man than 
this. And he was still very 
lonely. 

Juan decided that he might 
be a man if he were very . 
educated. So, still young, he 
enrolled at a university in La 
Jolla, California. But the 
more he learned, the more 
confused he became. By the 
time he was soon to graduate. 
he knew even less about 
being a man than on the day 
he left the mountain. 

Juan decided that there 
was one thing more he could 

try. He would find a woman. 
Together they would learn 
what it is to be a man. How 
trange it was that the 

thought of this woman made 
him even more lonely. 

One pring aflernuulI,ju311 
sat on a bench in the Revelle 
Plaza, hoping to meet a very 
fine woman. It wa hot and 
Juan at ero s-legged on the 
bench, wearing only hi s 
s horts and sandal . The sun 
came around him like a warm 
bath and he felt very good. I 
will meet a very fine woman 
today, Juan thought . 

Many women walked by 
the ben h where Juan sat. It 
pleased him to watch them. 
He liked the way they glided 
s moothl y, finger -toss ing 
their hair back as they went 
along. He liked to watch their 
hair bounce as they walked 
and he liked to watch their 
gistening calves, their thin, 
delicate fingers . Some of the 
women loved him very much, 
even though they did not 
know him . Juan could tell the 
ones who loved him the most. 
They would not look into hi 
eyes. They would walk by the 
bench many times, but they 
would not look into his eyes. 
Juan thought that he might 
love some of them, but he 
wasn't sure. 

Some of the women sat on 
the bench and talked with 
him. He thought many of 
them were very nice. He 
wanted to be friends with 
some of them. But if the 
women only liked him and 
did not love him, they did not 
have much time to be his 

friend . And if they loved him. 
they did not want to be hi 
friend. This made Juan very 
sad. And it made him very 
lonely. 

When the afternoon moved 
out over t he ocean, the air 
grew cooler and Juan was 
growing weary. From his 
backpack Juan took a hirt. 
stood to put il on. then at 
again, zipping his pack and 
preparing to leave. While h 
was doing this , a very pretty 
girl of about nineteen years 
came to it on the bench 
beside him. She miled at 
him, then, taking a book from 
her backpack, she read. 

Juan watched her read and 
a thought came to him and he 
was very afraid. A thin 
strand of wheat· blonde hair 
swept down above her left 
brow, swept on back behind 
her ear and fell evenly to her 
shoulders. Her lips were 
bright red below strong 
cheekbones and her neck was 
long and firm and narrow and 
her skin was sun-browned 
and smooth. She was square 
of houlder and lean and her 
collar bones showed large 
and hard above her breasts. 

"Hello," Juan aid. 
" Hi ," she said, in a 

pleasant but noncommital 
voice that Juan, from reading 
in books , knew women 
practiced. 

j'Jan wanted to say more 
but his lips were tone and she 
had eyes of a color Juan did 
not know and he knew that 
he loved her. He had never 
seen her until now, but he 
was sure that he loved her. 

Put A Little 

he smiled and Juan found 
it very difficulL to look into 
her eyes. 

"You are very beautiful," 
Juan thought. 

"No," Lisa thought in 
return, miling, a ·low 
sparkle coming into her eyes. 
"No. That cannot be. urely, 
I mu 1 look a fright. But 
th;mk youju:l th sa me." 

"Will you have lunch with 
me?" he asked. 

"No, I'm sorry." she aid. 
"but thank you just the arne. 
You see, I mu st go to my 
boyfriend. I am sure that he 
lov me deilrly." 

"I see," Juan said, Quickly 
turning his head to follow a 
small cloud that had formed 
in the shape of a bathtub. 

"Goodbye," she said, 
standing and smiling down at 
him. "I hope to see you 
again." 

She turned and walked 
away. 

As he sat there watching 
her go,Juan's hands trembled 
violently and he hoped she 
had not noticed his foolish, 
toothy grin. He stood, his legs 
went light, and he blurted, 
"I'll throw in a carton of 
milk!" 

This made Lisa laugh very 
much, but she just miled 
back at him and hook her 
head and kept walking. 

Juan sat back down-on the 
bench, leaned back on his 
hands, closed his eyes and 
knew w hat it was to be a 
man. And he was very alone.

I wa somewhat taken 
aback at this out burs t of 
cynicism from fri e nd 
Wein tein (though I 
shouldn't have been: he 
makes W.C. Fields look like 
Pollyanna) but he had a point. 
There has been a plet hora of 
aging film stars lumbering 
around the country recreat -
ing their original Broadway 
roles . s uch a s V-Haul 
Brynner in hi s Oscar-
winning role in The King and 
I. Wrecks Harrison in his 
Oscar-winning role in My 
Fair Lady. and now Burton . 
(Dick didn't get to do the 
movie role. so that's why he 
doesn't have an Oscar.) I had 
grown up listening to the 
Broadway soundtrack album 
of Camelot with Burton.Julie 
Andrews and Robert Goulet 
warbling those Lerner and 
Loewe tunes. and being the 
die-hard romantic that I am. I 
looked forward to reliving a 
moment of Sixtie idealism 
and by implication. a touch of 

JFK no -talgia. He;ides the 
reviews from Broadwa . had 
been ecs tat ic " Who says you 
can ' t go home aga in'" raved 
th e N ell' York Tim es. 
"Richa rd Burton relurnprl In 
the kingdom of Ca melot and 
it was as if he ne\'er le ft. " 

Well , not Quit e. I'm sorry 
but Thomas Wolfe was right : 
you can 't go home aga in . 19 I 
is not 1961. and thi s version 
of Come/ot has about as 
much regal bearing as a 
weekend in Chula Vi st a . 

The maior IJroblem is 

Burton . Hi s vo ice s till 
remains one of the great 
instrument s of the Western 
world but the pa ion , the 
vitality that was inherent in 
even his mo t mundane roles, 
has been 10 t. lI e giv s the 
'ense of being a s urvivor of 

an emotional holocaus t that 
ha - left him practically 
paralyzed; he looks like he ' 
thankful just to be alive. 
Then, of course, there's the 
age problem. King Arthur is 
supposedly a young innocent 
as the play begins, but 
Burton looks more like King 
Lear. 

Admittedly. he is not 
helped by director Frank 
Dunlop's staging, which 
allows Burton to remain 
oblivious to the other actors 
by having him face the 

audien c while os tensibl y 
s peaking lo t he rest of the 
cas t. 

Burton seems un comfort -
a ble in hi s part; fiLlingly the 
only l im he romes to li fe is 
during his ~o lil (XI Ui es . When 
he is s ta nding a lone on stag , 
one-on-one wit h the aud i-
nee, fo r a fell brie f sel:Ond s 

t here is a I ranscendanc

As for Ihe rest of the ca ·t , 
they are amiable enough bUI 
but a s ide from Paxt on

totally ill -suited for their

Guinevere has allth depth of 
a bubbl e-headed high 'Chool

be more in line for queen of

his tragic involvement with 
Guinevere 'eem like nothing 
more than a pa 's ing crush. 
Robert Fox is passable a 
Mordred but his prancing

Doors in retrospect: 'ap-ocalypse now' 
Morrison helped group to shed Americanized Stones image 

BY TED BURKE 
Arts Editor 

When the first Doors album was 
released in 1967 (Doors) they were 
at once compared by critics to the 
Rolling Stone , praised in fact for 
being their American counterparts. 
Such was hardly the case though. as 
the Door's subsequent identity took 
hold. The Stones and the Doors did 
share certain similarities - a 
charismatic lead singer backed by 
musicians who had no discernable 
identity of their own - but from there 
the two bands differ radically. 

From the start. The Stones made it 
plain that they were s treet punks in 
the abstract who couldn't care less 
about odal conventions, who flirted · 
with various forms of social deviance 
- drug, homosexuality, revolution-
ary politics , satanism - often times 
mixing all of them on the same album 
ju t a matters of s tyle. Though the 
Stones seemed to typify all these 
sociopathic tendencies , they were 
ambiguous in their s tance and their 
music, making an art out of their 
maladjus ted Iran paranc:y. The 
genius of Mick Jagger and crew wa 
the way they could a s imilate the 
detail s of s ub-cultural exi stence 
(black blues . cheap booze. bad s mack, 
Teddy boy violence) and transmorgify 
each into lyric subject matter. half 
serious, half parody, all disturbing. 

Unlike the Stones. Jim Morrison 
and the Doors operated in a vividly 
expressed milieux. urban Los 
Angeles , and weren't able to divorce 
themselves from it as]agger was able. 
While Jagger was a stylist and 

.-plagueriser of forms , Morrison was. in 
tbe old image of Rimbaud, Mallerme, 
Patchen and Kerouac. a poet 
completely engrossed in the energy of 

-hi time. Th1 was both his- trength 
and weakness. At best. as in his songs 
"The Crystle Ship," "The Unknown 
Soldier." "When the Music's Over." 
and "The Soft Parade," and in his 
straight verse, like "Horse 
Lattitudes, " he could evoke a 
situation with bone bare imagery, and 
infuse it with a passion that was 
nearly unbearable. At wors t, as 
evident on the Solt Parade album , he 
was a gutles ' romantic: his poetry 
was co n volut ed , un s haped a nd 
downright embarra s ing. In either 
case, Morrison wa,:> an ar t ist w ho 
couldn ' t separate him elf from Ihe 
things waxed poetic abou t. 

Stones seemed to be putting us on. or 
merely intent on the gross out, there 
was a psychotic obsession in 
Morrison's work. Running through 
the first album's songs. "Light My 
Fire" (a Mailere que love-is-sex-i -
death equation). "The Crystle Ship" 
(an encouragement for a woman, or 
friend. to surrender to the inevitable. 
i.e., 00. and to experience the last 
word in catharsis) . and most 
importantly "The End" (a p eudo-
Freudian lyric of Oedipal ob es ion, 
going from vague references to " blues 
buses" to a creaming portion where 
the protagoni s t . pres umably 
Morrison ' unchained Id, kills his 
father and fucks hi mother), wecome 
upon the dominant themes in the 
Door's music. Morri on, possibly 
spurred by media hype that the 
Sixties were a new age of Dionysous . 
saw his miss ion to "liberate" the kids 
from their comfortable. affluent hell s 
in uburbia and to guide them to toal 

experiential debauchery. He even 
went so far as to describe the Doors as 
not musicians. but rather as "erotic 
politician s, " To know life. he 
reasoned . one must embrace 
experience and then go crazy and then 
follow through to the inevitable. 
death, which is the same thing as 
ultimate bliss. 

Of course. j may be off-base, but I 
doubt it. Morrison wasn't noted as a 
clear thinker. He was a visionary who 
wanted to be a poet, a would·be film 
maker and playwright . someone who 
conceived images not in terms of 
order. but of chaos. Morri on loved 
action . and the more cacaphonous a 
scene wa , the more he loved it. 

So to talk about Morrison's work is 
u eless if one tries to i olate a few 
songs and di ssect them one by one. 
Rather, one has to broaden the scope 
of discussion and to in troduce Theater 
into the mess, s ince Morrison saw it a 
central to his work. Indeed. some of 

the Door's most impressive works 
were arranged as passion plays of 
sorts. 

Seven years ago. in Detroit. I was 
watching CKLW TV, a Canadian 
station. when one of those hokey. 
government sanctioned programs 
came on_ 

The theme of the show was the 
"new rock," featurinl{ such likely 
prospects as The Jefferson Airplane. 
Canned Heat, The Paupers (a cheesy 
Canadian imitation of the 'San 
Francisco bands) and the Doors. 
Hosted by Noel Harrison . the 
narration was the usual pap that was 
being written about rock at thetimein 
Time, Newsweek, Life, and Look: rock 
is music with a message, the voice of 
the young, ad nauseum, treated as a 
subject for pop (i .e. , amatuer) 
sociology instead of as viable art. 
Morrison and the Doors performed 
"The End" uncensored . Morrison's 
performance wa one of the most 
astounding things I've ever 
witne ed. The band (Bobbie Krieger 
on guitar, Ray Manzarek on organ and 
John Dens moe on drums) started off 
the song, a me merizing Indian motif 
predi c ated on Eastern-drone 
variations. Krieger's guitar spun out 
supple. s inewy tones, strengthened by 
Manzarek 's bluesy organ textures and 
Densmore's sharp, ruminative 
percussion. Morrison. who'd been 
playing tamborine, eventually 
grabbed the mike and began to croon 
the opening lines: 
This is the end 
Beautiful friend. the end. 
Of everything that stands 

__ the end .... 
I'll never look into your eyes 

again .. . 
Can you imagine 
What we' ll be? 
So little strong will yet free 
Desperately in need 
Of some strangers' hand 
[n a desperate land ... 

From the opening, the song slips 
into variou s form s . becoming a 
fractured narrative of kids cut from 
their middle-cia s roots and forced to 
make do with their own improvised 
devices, eager to gras p anything that 
lend a ,'embla nce of order . 

Like the Stones. Morrison and the 
Door suggested danger, menace. 
eX]JCr it:!l1ce outside th norm. But the J;m Morr;srm 

"The End" progressed I h rough its 
testamen ts o f di savow I 10 t he 
culmi nat ing coda where Morri son 
in tones t he death of t he fa mily unit by 
killing his fa ther and fucking hi ' 
mother. the ultimate inevita ble. Up to

Doors: 
a rock and 
roll essay 
con tinued from page 25 
now, he had acted out the 
parts with proper manner, 
cocking his hips suggestively 
as he sang his phallic 
metaphors (" ... ride the 
snake/the snak" he's long .. .. " 
Morrisons' recurring image 
of liberat ion. social and 
carnal). But when he came to 
this segment. he let loose 
with a blood curdling scream 
on the "mother" line and 
then collapsed on stage. 

The band followed suit. 
producing a crescendo of 
contrary sounds from their 
instruments and then falling 
down. Manzarek slumped 
over his keyboards and 
Densmore over his drums; 
Krieger was on his knees. 
The thread of the song began 
again. and Morrison slowly 
arose, with a demon's gleam 
in hi eyes. and entered intoa 
reprise of the first verse. This 
was brilliantly staged thea· 
ter. if nothing else. 

I dislike the songs these 
days - as a listening 

experience it 's tedious and 
takes con iderable time to get 
to the meat (11 minutes 
worth). The lyrics aren't all 
that good either, despite ome 
nice, elliptical images. "The 
End" lacks unity and musical 
trength, but the perfor· 

mance I witnes ed in the 
inner · sanctum of my 
basement was masterful. 
Morrison chose to be a 
surrogate godhead for the 
hordes of weekend hedon ists. 
and was able to channel 
considerable energy through 
a piece of music Ihat was no 
better and no more than 
therapeutic psychodrama. 

Strange Days, their second 
a lbum. contained another II· 
minute select ion, "When T he 
Music's Over." As though 
they realized the conceptual 
fai lure of "The End,' the 
Doors tried their hand again 
at it and came up with a fully 
realized theater presentation 
t hat was as close to a rock 
masterpiece as anything ever 
has been. Manzerak's organ 
introduces it with pensive, 
stabbing swipe ' at the key, 
underpinned by a throbbing· 
Iy pers istent bassline . 
Seconds lat er, Densmore 
whips off a machine gun 
drum roll and Morri son 
scream s with terrifying 
inten 'ity . Krieger hils a 
chord and t hen holds it, 
allowing his amplifier to 
feedback , manipulating the 
sound until it sounds like a 
trapped animal growling at 
it predator.

'Fast Lane' is slo\V 
BY TED BURKE 

Arts Editor 
Life In The Fast Lane -
Michael Bloomfield (Rounder 
Records) 

By implication Rounder 
Record as ure us that they 
didn 't choose the title of Mike 
Bloomfield 's last album, 
asserting t hat the l;lte 
guitarist had come up with 
the idea himself. Their 
stance eems dearly to be a 

field's pre ence is curiously 
absent. 

The material is lacking in 
focu a well. Impre sive a 
Bloomfield' s eclec tici m 
might have been. t he 
arrangement of lyle . from 
soul to disco and blue to 
gospel. are aimless without a 
strong unifying instrumental 
personalit y. 

More di appointing is the 
fact that mo t of what leads 
Bloomfield does take are on 

Record Reviews/Ted Burke 
'plea of innocence - no cheap 
jokes or morali zing here -
but it maya well have been 
an attempt to di own any 
respon ibility for the record 
beyond releasing it. Life In 
The Fast Lane is a mediocre 
disc. a rather ignoble final 
te tament by a eminal rock 
musician. 

The basic problem i that 
Bloomfield sounds reticent to 
take command on the tracks: 
instead of exhibiting the 
di tinctive fine se that 's 
been his hallmark over the 
years. Bloomfield is often -
too often - merely part of the 
instrumental backdrop. 

Aside from the opening 
blue shuffle, "Maude" -
Bloomfield's leads are as 
sweet and stinging as they 
were with the Paul 
Butterfield Blues Band and 
the Electric Flag - and a

Doors: 
a rock and 
roll essay 
continued from page 26 
guiding structure here. The 
music bumps and grind in 
uni so n with Morri son 's 
syntact ical quirks, punct uat-
ing the words with a sort of 
audial cadence. Morrison's 
words here demonstrate hi 
greate t st r ength as a 
lyricist. The verses are stark. 
terse and tough. extending 
his allegory of chaos and 
liberation to nature itself, 
main tain ing that the final 
"breaking on through to the 
other s ide" (which I take to 
mean ma ns' subsumed 
animal nature) on the large 
scale will happen ecologically 
as well as in the social order. 
In the middle, he recites a 
mightIy evocative bi t of 
words: 

What have they done to the 
earth , 
What have they done to our 
fair s i ter? 
Ravaged and plundered and 
ripped her 

and bit her 

Stuck her with knives in the 
side of the dawn. 
dragged her with fences and 

Dragged Her Down .. . 
(I hear a very gentIesound_ .. ) 

In the ens uing parts, 
Morrison declares, "We want 
the world and we want it 
now," with a prefacing 
"now? Now? Nowwwww" be-
fore the conclusion of the 
line, denoting hesistance on 
the part of those with the 
most at stake (the kids) to 
take action. The band cranks 
then into a cacophoney of 
sound while Morrison 
screams under the din. with 
the names of Krishna and 
Jesus heard, and the repeated 
phrase "Save us." Caught in 
the audial anarchy, even 
Morrison screams for shelter. 

But that may be the point. 
Morrison wants us to push 
life to the limit, to come to 
grips with hesitance, 
confusion and uncertainty 
and to jump smack dab into 
the mess. The best yirtues of 
humankind are the inate 
capacity of self-destruction. 
Morrison doubtlessly saw 
real life as being more or less 
ritualized tendencies 
towards this anyway. 
Through his own use of 
ritual-codified in the rock 
concert set up he merely 
sought to hasten the process. 
CiVIlity is a subterfuge over 
an underlying reality. an ugly 
one. 

With later albums, 
Morrison tamed his act a bit. 
Waiting For The Sun 
contained solid tracks, and is 
in itself a good album, but 
there wasn't the fire of 
before_ When Morrison was 
bu ted in Miami for public 
lewdity , one would have 
thought that the flame had 
been snuffed out.

Monday, March 30, 1981 The Guardian 

The Doors in retrospect: 
poetic lyrics set them apart 
continued from page 28 
The Soft Parade was a universally panned 
album, and rightly so. Most of the songs were 
written by guitarist Krieger, and were the 
romantic fluff that the Doors originally 
sought to de troy_ The addition of violins, 
saxophones and other paraphenalia from Vic 
Damone records didn't help, e.ther. The 
Doors seemed hopelessly grounded in shlock. 

!The title tract , though. is the best of their 
theater constructs, and has been ignored. by 
and large. It starts with Morrison intoning in 
a passable Richard Burton imitation that he 
was in missionary school. and that a fellow 
student "put forth the proposition that you 
can petition the Lord with prayer." Morrison 
repeats the last five words suspiciously, 
pauses, and then screams (Morrison was a 
very effective screamer) "YOU CANNOT 
PETITION THE LORD WITH PRAYER." 
The song then proceeds through a series of 
schizoid temperament changes, from 
bu bblegum to go go to ballad lament, and then 
into a seductive jungle rhythm in which 
Krieger's guitar snakes and Morrison's 
vocals shine. 

Throughout, he enoumerated the street 
scenes of LA, conjuring visions of hot streets, 
neon signs and women dressed to kill. In the 
fade-out , he describes hordes of people 
engagin~ in a crazed, mindless bloodlust. a 
civilizatIOn disintegrating with its citizens 
unmindful. Towards the end, Morrison did 
multiple overdubs of his voice, each singing 
different lines, and doing a chi11ing call and 
response. The song fades out on one 
monotonous riff. repeated like machine work, 
like the pyschic gears gone awry. 

The Doors, like a few other bands, were 
characterized more by the singers' voices 
than by the music itself. Like Bowie. The 
Stones, Roxy Music or the Small Faces (wi th 
Rod Stewart), the voice was the vehicle that 
defined the songs, set the mood and upplied 
the push which 'set the band apart from the 

rest.- Morrison's voice wa an inst rument of 
singular identity and power. It was basically 
a husky baritone without much dynamic 
range, and was untrained (there are some 
examples of very bad s inging on The Soft 
Parade). Yet his voice was rarely tentative. He 
was able to push it hard, forcing it out front. 
His st range, quarter not nuances supplied 
irony and tension, he could manage dramatic 
swoops and savage slurring, and his trade-
marked screaming, hollaring and yelling 
were put to beautiful use. Jagger had to have 
the sanctity of the studio to put in a decent 
performance, and even then only when he 
was buried in the sound mix. Morrison was 
always up front, pushing it to-the limit. 

Morrison wanted to a film maker and a 
writer more than a rock star. He made one 
film, FeIlSt of Friends. which I've never seen. 
His one book of poetry, The Lords and The 
New Creatures, which I stole from the Mithras 
bookstore five years ago, is hard to 
recommend. Robert Christagu once noted 
that the only real rock poetry are the words

Concert Review/William Hamilton 

Travers, Blackrnore 
fail to produce 

A near-ca pacity crowd 
filled the San Diego Sports 
Arena last Monday in search 
of the heavy-metal Promised 
Land. only to discover that 
modern Moses Pat Travers 
and his false prophet cronie 
Ritchie Blackmore had led 
them not to Israel, but rather 
to a rock and roll demilitar-
ized zone_ 

Indeed, Deep Purple 
refugee Blackmore, a weary 
veteran of numerous 
personnel changes in his 
band Rainbow, would appear 
to have lost the enthusiasm 
he once exuded during live 
performances_ Rain bow's 
latest release, Difficult to 
Cure, was a disappointing 
and fairly calculated entry 
into the heavy -metal 
maelstrom of records, taking 
no chances with dabbling 
into creative or imaginative 
composition, his guitar 
pyrotechnics reduced to a 
smouldering ember_ 

Despite his uninspiring 
material Blackmore did 
something he has been wont 
to do in concert - he played 
the guitar with his hands and 
mind in tead of with his feet. 
During a guitar solo segment 
Blackmore displayed glimp-
ses of his sudio performing 
ability . once critically 
acclaimed by heavy metal 
taste-mongers and neophyte 
plug-in-the-Marshall-and-
f1oor-the-tunes "guitarists. He 
effectively egued between the 

class ically inspired ditty 
"Greensleeves," a jazz-blues 
series of glissendos replete 
with haunting echo as sweet 
and as pure as Robben Ford, 
and with staccato runs 
sweeping the range of the 
fret board - and promptly 
launched back into a 
horrendously dull set. 

Pat Travers, who head-
lined the show, fared little 
better but provided a slightly 
more up-tempo uplift -
which the audience, 
stultified by a lackluster 
Rainbow set, appeared to 
appreciate. He cranked out all 
the hits, including the 
popular audience-participa-
tion number, "Boom Boom -
Out Go the Lights," which 
drew the expected response 
from the adrenalin-rushed 
mob. 

There is a moral to the 
Travers approach to rock and 
roll : No matter how intense 
the decibel level of Johnny B. 
Goode, it's still Johnny B_ 
Goode, I IV V, and not the 
1812 Overture. There comes 
a point when excruciating 
sound levels cease to enhance 
the raw and powerful motif 
that hard rock is, but instead 
dulls the mind more than the 
music being broadcast. 

Opening the show were 4

••• 
Remember going to 

Disneyland when you were a 
kid and seeing the audio 
animatronic robot of 
President Lincoln? When 
&atkma"iIl played the Fox 
Theatre recently, that same 
feeling of a sanitized, wax-
figure machine was eerily 
present throughout the 
show. 

Everything was played 
safe; every stock sociological 
cliche about the 60's was 
dragged out and )JOunded 
over the spectator's head like 
Maxwell's proverbial silver 
hammer, while the note-for-
note duplication of the 
records only increa ed the 
sterility of the performance. 

After all, what's the point? 
Why not stay home and listen 
to Beatles records ripped to 
the gills on acid? You could 
certainly come up with a 
better light show than the 
moronic display of "meaning-
ful and relevant" 60's photos 
that were continuously 
shoved down the audience's 
throat. 

Talk about your basic 
Brecht ia di tancing device: 
while the McCart.ney clone 
crooned "Hey Jude," the 
screen was full of cop -
beating demon strators, 
bloodied heads, and rampag-
ing radicals. 

The attitude seemed to be 
"if it's from the 60' it'll fit." 
And it was amazingly 
chauvini tic: for all the 
emphasis placed on Ameri -
can events, the Beat les could 
have come from Pitts burgh . 
In the wake of Lennon's 
death there was more than a 
touch of necrophilia about 
the whole enterprise. Like 
the Camelof revival, this i a 
shoddy attempt to cash in on 
60's nostalgia that cheapen 
and tarnishes the memory of 
the original.

Eagles Live - The Eagles 
(Asylum) 

As live rock albums go, thi s 
one isn 't too bad, much better 
than Fleetwood Mac Live, 
though less fu n than 
Frampton Comes Alive. Yet 
why anyone would want to 
own live versions of old hits 
- "Take It To The Limit ," 
"The New Kid In Town," 
"Life's Been Good" - that 
are virtual clones of the 
original album tracks is 
something I don't under-
stand. I wonder if Asylum 
still intends to release a 
great est hit s package, as 
companies are wont to do 
when no new record is 
forthcoming. B. 

Kings of the Wild 
Frontier - Adam and the 
Atlts (Epic) 

A curious mixture of Ziggy 
period Bowie and the droning 
minimalism of every other 
arty post-new wave band , 
Adam and the Ant areworth 
a Ii ten if only to test one' 
limits of credu li ty. After that , 
their novelty valuedissipates 
rapidly and leaves one with 
two sides of tiff would-be 
cleverness. Sorry guys. D. 

Laughter - 1m! Dury and 
the Blockheads (Stiff) 

Surprisingl y, jazz trumpet 
ace Don Cherry makes a 
sudden appearance on "Yes 
and No," adding an errie and 
icy brasRiness to Dury' s 
singlular tyle of Cockney 
pub-rock. Otherwise, Dury 
and the Blockheads keep 
their an Impulses in check, 
touching lightly on Thelo-
nious Monk to Jerry Lee 
Lewis, as they sing songs 
about trying to maintain 
one's humanity in an age 
where romantiCism is dead. 
Brave new rock and roll. B_

that make it a lyric first 
and foremost; that is, lyrics 
can deal with more than ju t 
romantic love and such 
claptrap, but the s killed 
writer hones then down to 
the metres of a good song. 
Morrison's collection here is 
without music, and wasn't I 
meant to have any, but 
there's a lack of rhythm and 
power . Additionally, the 
images are too insular to 
mean much to anybody, 
though he did manage some 
nice comments on the 
ritualistic-cu ltural use of 
cinem a and theater. 

Morrison, of course, died of 
a heart attack. A strange 
thing for a rock ·tar to die of, 
but some friends commented 
that Morrison probably had 
more internal damage than 
he or his doctors thought rom 
a ll those year' of falling off 
concert stages. In ij sense, 
Morrison followed through 
on his own dictum .
