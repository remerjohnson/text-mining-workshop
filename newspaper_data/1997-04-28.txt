Toward Achieving

America has lalked a 101 aboullax reform in Ihe 
lasl 12 months. Sieve Forbes. heir to Ih(' Forhes

own dollars running for pre),iucnt on a platlorm 
whose cenlral (~ome would say only) plank called 
for Ihe JI1lroouclion of a \lal income tax Ihal _would 
indude a lax cuI. Olher Republi can pre~ldcnlial

Just hefon; comJl1g 10 San Diego lasl Augusl , Boh

l:cnt reduction In lax ratcs. 

And si nce Ih ' ovemher eleclion. PreSident 
Clinlon has offercd hiS own lax proposal~ : a suh-
stantlal education tax creui t for two year~ or educa-
lion heyond hi gh school and some kind of capi tal -
gains lax relief. 

Tax refurm seems 10 be one or Ihose i~,ues Ihat 
polili 'ians arc always talking about. wilhout ever 
laking real action. We have nOI had ~ignilicanl 
reform allhe federal level si n(c Ihe Tax Reform Act 
of 1986. Tax reduction always seems 10 play second 
liddle 10 other Issue,. There never scems 10 be a 
good time for it because it is such a complicaled 
lopic. 

everthelcss, now is an e pecially good time for 
a lax cut. The Tax FoundalllJn eslimales Ihat the 
averag'dual -i n (jm family pays oul nearly 40 per-
cenl of Iheir inc me in local , Siale and federallaxes . 
rederal taxe~ currenlly devour more than 25 per-

cenl of a Iypical 
family's income. Americans know Ihal Ihese tax 
bite~ are too large and wou ld gladly welcome a cuI. 

However. certain features of Ihe political climale 
have gollen in Ihe way. 

/)ejicil Spe/J(/il1g: The federal government cur-
renlly has around $5 trillion In oUlstanding deht and 
is adding around 5,200 hillion per year (about $500 
n1Jllion pcr day) 10 Ihal fi gure. Till.' conventional 
wisdom is thai unti I we gel our li~cal hou,),! III 
order, we simply cannOI (u t ta xes. Instead of a 
focw, on taxcs, Ihe defiCit I"" Ix:come the predom-
inalll economic iS~lIl: . 

Class WCI/fare . The Repuhlicans were hadly 
hcalen hy Presidenl linton and Ihe Democrats la,1 
year when Ihe Democrals charged thai Repuhlicans 
were gUlling "Medic:lld. Medicare, educalion and 
Ihe environmenl" 10 pay for tax cuts "for Ihe rich ." 
In loday'~ political cl imate, nearly every tax cuI-
thal's offered gels branded by liberals and their 
accomplices a being only "for Ihe rich," 

Lo0p/lUles. While a broad lax cut would benelil 
nearly everyone. "paying" r r a tax cut by closing 
lax loopholes and ending lax deductions and credits 
would hurt some people. These people have lobby-
IstS who arc paid to make sure thai Ihe e loofV1otes 
are nOI closed. Besides, one of Ihe biggesl dcduc-

lion~ of all - the mortgage-intere I deduclion -
will probably never be re cindeu . It would cau~e 
property \'n lues to decline by Irillions of dollars.

Running around like a poultry suffering from a 
severed cranium? Me too . That's why when Bob 
and I were running late to our deep-sea fishing 
lesson we decided to fly through the Munch Box 
for a quick breakfast. We found all sorts of 
luscious goodies . Bob grabbed a big cup of hot 
cocoa and a couple of yummy frosted doughnuts 
delivered fresh that morning! I picked a so-fresh-
tt-was-still-warm blueberry bagel, a fresh fruit 
cup stuffed with juicy pineapple, red grapes, 
cantaloupe and honeydew melon, and a fresh 
gourmet coffee for a little boost. Those deep-
sea fish are big you know! We also found hot 
soup-of-the-day, pre-wrapped gourmet 
sandwiches, Distinctively Light salads, ice cream, 
cold drinks, and bunches of candies and snacks! 
Talk about convenience! Take home macaroni 
and cheese, c'ereal, Pop -Tarts, or brownie mix . 
You can even get the brownie pan at the Munch 
box! They also carryall sorts of sundry items 
like hair brushes and laundry detergent, even 
bluebooks and school supplies! So, if you're 
running late to that midterm and need a quick 
meal or if you desperately need to wash clothes, (619)569-GAME

It is surpri sing that Ms.

difference between an underrepre-
sentcd group and a minority. While 
Greeks at UCSD may be a minori -
Iy Ihey arc certainly nOI underrep-

arc a high percentage of Greeks in 
high politica l positions in thi s 
country." Docs thi s give Greeks

of any olher "services" besides 
those provided by O.A.S.I.S . and 
the lihrary,! Perhaps it is this igno-
ran ce which scares those who use 
these unmentioned servit:es. 

The real is~ul.: here is 1ll0S1 elo-

Provost Defended 
GEs Too Zealously 
Edilor: 

Alkr reading kssyca Wallacc's 
artidl: on Ihl: GE requircments at 
Muir olkge ("Picking a 

Pedagogy," Guardio/J, April 21 , 
1997 ), I was not surpri sed that the 
provosl of Muir rcspondcd 
(Readers ' Forum, Guardiall , April 
24, 1997). I am, however, surprised 
at the t:onlent of the response, most-
ly because of hi s defense of. not only 
Muir 's, bul Warren's requirements. 
Provost Ledden 's arguments against 
Wallace 's ~tateillents arc Ilawed and 
exhihil Ihe viewpoint of an outsider 
who doesn' t undersland whal the<;e 
requiremcnts really mcan. 

First the provost t: laims th ai the 
helief that "~tudcnl " in comparable 
major:, in Muir (and Warr.:n ) tak.: 
as many a~ 12 fewer university 
I.:ve l course, than students in ... 
Rcv.: ll e." is "nonsense." 
Obviou~ly, he ha~ not ~al in a "e,-
lion I' Warren Writing 10A/B. 
Thi s "dass" leaches low-Ievc l 
writing skills and tri e:, 10 int:orpo-
rate an ethi cal or moral twi st. 
However. these Iwo classes are 
only "university level" because 
they are taught at a university, nol 
bccause they tcach eo ll cge level 
English. Matcrial for Ihis course 
consists of articles from 
Newsweek, the LA Times, or the 
Guardian , not Ihe top sources of 
literature. 0 advanced journals of 
any kind wi II be found in the $30 
Warren Writing h 1 k Ihey forcc 
you 10 bu y. To t:all these GE, 
"challenging" is an insult to Ihe 
st udenls of UCSD, and inde.:d. the 
onl y persons who profit from 
Warrcn Wriling is Cal CO[lY. 

Thesc arc onl y two dasses of 
many that are forced upon Warren 
Studl.:nls, including Ihe programs of 
concentrat ion that often lead to 
classes full of disinlercsted sludenls 
who need to lill their GEs. Warrcn 
College docs not "give Ilexihilily 'to 
develop douh le majors, special pro-
Ject majors, and (Jlhcr t:hallcnging 
programs" because of the restri c-
ti ons on what specific classes a stu -
dent I:an take. I I' I had to t: hoose a 
collegc over again , il t:l.:nainly 
would nOI be Warren because of Ihe 
rl.:striclion, on what ,orl of classes I

row-minded articles derived out of 
Pcter Chang), hut as a forum to 
address the quality of educalion at 
UCSD, Ihe Guardia" is the perfeci 
medium. For a provost to a!lack an 
opinion on an obviously flawed 
system , specifica ll y Warrcn 
College's requirements, is irrespon-
:,ible and nonprooucli ve. A provost 
sh uld investigalc how Muir stu-

an income of $20.000. 15,000 in 
deductions and a 30 percent tax

eliminaling the deduclions and 
lowering the rate to 7.5 percent, Ihe 
government sti II gets $1 ,500. hUI

However. Ihe henefils of a sim-

Ihat 5.4 billion hours arc spent 
computing federal tax relurns every 
year. The Tax Foundalion eSlimales

efforts of politicians to favor their

This is why Presidcnt Clinton's 
"targeted" tax cuts are a move in 
thc wrong direclion. They wou ld 
add complexity to an already com-
plicated sy tem and reinfon:e the 
tendency to usc taxation for social 
policy. 

Dole's approach emphasized a 
reduclion in rates and a si mpli!'ica-
ti on of Ihe lax system. This propos-
al is Ihe right idea. but il shou ld 
come in Iwo slages. Firsl, we 
should ref'orm Ihe system while 
maintaining our currenl revenue 
base. Only aftcr Ihe delicil is elim-
inated should we consider reduc-
ing taxes. 

There IS urgent need for lax

plificalion of the sy. tem rather 
Ihan a ,lew of new credits and 
exel1l[llions. However, Ihere must

CUTS: 
Taxes should be 
lowered right now 
Contlnaed from page 4 
according 10 some cstimates. 

These arc Ihe polilical condi-
lions that are hilrting the prospect. 
for lax cuts the most. Gelling lax 
cuts passed Ihis year would be a 
monumental feal for Republi 'ans, 
hUI it is doubtful whelher they have 
adequale leadership to do so. 

Nevertheless, 40 percent is far 
too heavy a burden for American 
taxpayers 10 hear. In 1955. the tax 
hurden for Ihe Iypical American 
famil y (i nc luding loca l. stale and 
federal laxes) was ahoul 28 per-
cent. That 's more Ihan 10 percent -
age poinls lower than today's lax 
burden. And whal do we have to 
show for this increased wcight '! 
More cri mc in our inner cities. 
falling educational siandards, run-
away medical costs and unconlrol -
lah le Social SecurilY prit:e increas-
es. 

Although America 's tax burden 
is lower Ihan those of other coun-
Iries, no govemment has the righl 
to confiscate nearly 40 percenl of 
its population 's income. There is a 
greater moral imperalive for tax 

culS Ihan 10 balance the budget. 
While il is wrong to saddle our 
chi Idren 's generation wil h debt 
from wasteful spending, it is equal-
ly wrong to say thai we should 
kee[l taxcs high enough to suppo rt 
wasteful spending. instead of using 
a ri sing defi ei l as leverage for sup-
port i ng spcnding decreases. 

Eliminating lax credils and 
loopholes aDd CUlling spending arc 
great ideas, but the special interesls 
Ihat support Ihese programs are too 
powerful 10 be taken on all at once. 
The righl strategy'J Go for a Dole-
st yle 15 [lercenl (or more) across-
Ihe-hoard cut in tax rates. (This is 
eas ier said Ihan done, hut jusl 
parade Ihat 40 per,:clli ti gurc hefore 
the voters and walch Ihelll 

re~[lond .) 
Tax cullers t:3n then usc the 

dri ve 10 balance the hudgel 10 Iheir 
ad vantage: Because lax revenues 
are lower, wasteful government 
spending would have 10 be cuI. It 
cannol be de~reased all at once, but 
each special interesl protecling its 
pet progrnm can be taken on one at 
a time. Dividc and conquer is Ihe 
only way to defeat special-interest 
spending and lax loopholes. Tax 
simplifi calion (i .e. eliminating 
economy-distorting lax loopholes 
and credits) will be as hard to 

OPINION 7 

al:<:ornplish as CUlling spending for 
pet programs, but again, the sirate-
gy hould be to divide and conquer. 
Go afler corporate loopholes first , 
then the sticky exemptions like the 
adoption tax credi l, or thc educa-
tion tax credit. 

Tax cuts are not so much aboul . 
cconomics as they are aboul poli -
ti cs. For bCller or for WOI'. e. the 
drive 10 eliminate delicil spending 
has created a polilical prcsumption 
againsl tax cuts. Tax decreases 
should evcntually be matched by 
spending CUI S, bUI a polilical eli-
male Ihal accuses lax cullers of 
rohhing rrom Ihe poor to give 10 Ihe 
rich rnake~ CUlling spending and 
taxes atlhe same lime an impracli -
cahle sirale!,: . 

Because no government should 
take nearly 40 percen t or ilS cili-
lens' income. Ihe case for lax culs 
can plausibly he made on il s own. 
Republicans should therefore de-
link the issue of tax cuts from con-
cern aboul the deticit , tax sirnpliti -
cation and spending CUIS. 

Tax cuts are feasible if 
Republicans go againsl the grain of 
a polilical cullure obsessed with the 
deficil and spending eulS. 
Disassocialing lax cliis from Ihese 
issues will improve chances for 
reform on all front s.

DIG: Planned 
dam construction 
threatens sites 
Continued from page 1 
dcvelopmcnt," he said. 

The discovery of cobblestone 
treets support the specu lation that 

Titris was created by planned hous-
ing, Algaze added. Thesc thorough-
fares were laid before the construc-
tion of the dwellings, much like in 
modem housing developmcnts. 

The excavated homes also fea-
tured crypts within the perimeter of 
thcir structures. In most cases, 
these tombs were constructcd in a 
central courtya rd, surrounded hy 
living and cooking areas. 
According to Algalc, thi s is a 

~ trong indication of somc form of 
anccstor veneration. 

However, the;,e crypts and other 
cemeteries may have also ;,erled 
another purpo~e . Homcowl1l.:rs fre -
que ntly had cerncteric;, at the edge;, 
or their properly. and the location 
and ornatcnes~ or a gra\c ci tt: \\a~ a 
primary Indicator of famIly power. 
Algaze said. 

More evidem:e of power and 
cia s in Titris is revealed through 
residents' di cts. Archaeologist;, can 
sometimes recover animal hones or 
food left overs that indicatc thc 
quality of thc food - a direct cor-
relation to an indi viduals' dass and 
power s t atu ~. 

"There arc all sons of games 
you can play to see who has acces, 
to what resourccs," Aigal.c aid . 

Additionally, rcmain ;, of grains 
or edible plant s, parti cu larly cash 
crops, may indicate soc ial status. 

According to Algazc, industrial -
ized so 'iety did not origi natc dur-
ing the Industrial Revolution as is 
commonly believed. Rather, dis-
coveries from Titris indicate that 
special ized production of goods 
and urban development had already 
begun prior to that time. 

"My answer is that I industri al 
socictyl wa~ alive and kicking in 
2500 B.C.," Algazc said . 

The artifacts from Titris also 
revea l eV idence of belief in an 
afterlife. Algal.e said that a fo,-
si li/ed nower found inside of an 
excavated tomh was remarka hl y 
well pn:served and most likely 
served a~ a sort of final offering for 
the deceased. 

t the door to another tomh, the 
team found the hone of a sheep wuh 
meat sti II attached 10 it. According 
to Alga/e, thi ~ was part of a 
farewdl meal for the deceased's 
journey into th ' afterlife. 

"There was a belief in the after-
lire, and a bc lil:l' in providing provi -
sions for the afterlife." Algale said. 

It is di rti cu It to formu late fur-
ther conclusions ahout thi s because 
of the lack of evidence pertaining 
to religious ideology, he added. 

A Igaze and his team are current -
1y requesting additional funding to 
continue their work . According to 
Alga/.e, approximately three more 
years of excavation and study 
would be necessary to understand 
how industry and spccialiLed crafts 
were structured within the Titris. 

Titris and other archaeological 
points of interest in Southeastern 
Turkey arc currently threatened by 
population increases, Algaze said . 
Moreover, as part of the Turkish 
government 's industriali l.ation and 
modernilation plan. several large-
scale darns will be built in thc~area 
surro unding Titris. Archaeologil>t ;, 
predict that the nooding that wlil 
ensue from t hese re~ervo i r con-
truction will completely destroy 

Titris and other val uable sites.

Walt Dickinson 
Design Editor 

Love and 
Friendsh ip 

This isn't Illy forte . 1' 111 much 
more of a li stener than it speaker. 
and I hardly ever write. However, 
I do have sO lll elhing pcrsonal to 
share , and apparently e en the 
edito r who arranges the photos. 
choose the fonts and nit -picks 
about picas gets to have hi s say. 

Stop me if you 've hea rd thi, 
one before. Boy l1leets gi rl. Girl 
likes boy. Boy is stunned. They 
fall in lovc. They stay in love. 
Both are happy and life is sweet. 
They go to co llege. They like it 
there. They learn, they grow, they 
change ... and she leaves. 

Last November, my g irl fri end 
broke up with me. She left me 
with a pair of rings, a broken heart 
and three years' worth of 
wonderful memorie . In pari , she 
made me who I am. I'm certain I 
wouldn't be the person I am today 
if I hadn 't known her. 

Yet, I still struggle with the 
pain of losing her. It 's a wound I 
have to deal with every day. I' ve 
been told innumerable times that 
it pas es. In many ways I still 
don't understand where our paths 
diverged or why she doesn ' t love 
me anymore. I feel that this 
confusion, more than anything 
else , re triets me from resolving 
that period of my life. Moreover, 
it makes it allthe more difficult to 
be friends . 

I' ve had a lo ng time to look 
back on the hows and whys o f our 
breakup. If there 's anything I 
know for certain it's that there i 
no ce rtaint y, and lillie sense, in 
love. Here 's why. 

People don' t undersland why 
they fall in love. We wander 
through life, bumping into o thers 
and exchanging ideas. 
Occasionally, you bump into 
someone whose ideas you really 
dig. Or maybe you dig her looks 
al first and the ideas fall into place 
later. Either way. you discover 
someone who. for lack of a bettcr 
word. illuminates you . 

I don ' t suhscribe to the "soul-
mate" philosophy of love. The 
idea that there is one person in the 
world who's perfect for you, and 
vice-versa, ~ecms ludicrous to me. 
There's gOt to be more than one 
compatihle person for everyone. I 
like to think that therc are s hades 
to how well personalities mesh. 

So for whatever se t of 
subcon sc ious requirements on 
which we might rely, there is a 
subset of people in the world who 
fiLlf you' re lucky. you' lI find one 
of these people. If you' re really 
lucky, that person will di scover 
Ihat you fit her as well. And if you 
can make that last , buy lottery 
tickets - a sure thing in 
compa ri son . 

Mine didn' t last. When your 
first love carries itself three ye;us 
and Ihen vapori7es, it 's hard to 
readju ·\. It 's hard to orient 
yourse lf to the idea of other 
romances. II's even more di ffi cuh 
to co nsider the possibility of 
becoming friends with your ex -

What are some prevalent 

stereotypes of Asians? 
Interviews by Jessica Scheppmann 

Photography by Ethan Schreiber 

1 know that there is the 
stereolype that A sian guys 
dri ve lowered Inlegras, that 
all Asians are good al math 
and sc ience and that they're 
all nerds. 1 haven' l rea lly 
been subjected 10 thai many 
stereotypes but that may be 
because I hang around wi th 
mostly A sian people. 

Judy Yen 
Warren Jun ior 

see many stereotypes 
around. I went to a middle 
school that had a high popu-
lati on of Asians and a person 
once asked me, " Oh that 
must mean that everyone at 
your sc hool is smart ?" 
Stereotyping rfal se ly] 
assumes the same character-
istic in one or two indi viduals 
applies to an entire group. 

Mlna YaroslavHY 
Warren Sophomore 

I Ihink that all the As ian 
people at thi s school pretty 
much treat each other equal-
ly. On thi s campus, I haven't 
ex perienced any stereotypes 
put on me by any race olher 
than Asians themselves wi th-
in the Asian populati on at Ihis 
scho I. 

Jln Wee 
Revelle Junior 

We have the stereolype 
about Asians being studious 
and good in sc ience and 
malh; not exactl y party peo-
ple. I ' m against the stereo-
type. I know a lot of A sians 
and they' re not like that. 

David Felvman 
Roosevelt Freshman 

A major one is that Asians 
can' t drive. A stereotype of 
Japanese is Ihat they have to 
control their feelings and are 
very pri vate. A lot of people 
thi nk that hinese are real 
pushy. People j ust need to 
understand a culture before 
they pass j udgement on any-
one, and reali ze why people 
are the way they are.

UCSD Men's Crew Back on Top 
RETURN TO GLORY: Following a year of struggle, the Triton men hit the water with a splash and placed econd at State 

By Sean Rahlml and Steve Walsh 
Sports Writers 

It has taken a couple of yea rs, but the 
UC SD men's crew tea m has reached the to p 
once again. Foll ow ing a seaso n without a 

men 's varsi ty hO,II, the T ri · 
tons have regai ned a I'ootho ld 
on the Wes t Coast. c~ hibitin g 
their talents last wed, wit h a 
seco nd· place finish al th e 
Ca l i 1'0rtHa SI ate Champion-
ships he ld at Lake atoma . 
First place belonged to Cal 
Berk eley and its $500,000 
crew hudge!. 

The second-pl ace finish IS one or Ihe 
hest in school history . With a limeof6: 16.1, 
UCSD fi ni shed 20 seconds hehind Berke-
ley but ahead or UC Davis, San Di ego State, 
Long Beach Si ale, Santa Clara and Sacra-
mento State. 

Six of the eight rowers on the varsily 
squ ad are second· yea r pl aye rs who were 
ushered into UCSD crew last season by 
Wang and Roosend ahl. Capt ain Sam ic Is 
and I'e llow eni or Krim Rafaat round out the 
eight Tritons. 

"The way that Mike has it here is that we 
race our race." Icols said . "We go as fast 
as we can usi ng our own race pl an, and if we 
race 10 the full p lIen tia l th at we're able 10, 
we ' ll race our fastest possib le." 

With th is great rc,ull in their poc kcts, 
the men tra ve led to ewport th is past week· 
end fo r the ewport Invitational. D 
fi nished j ust one second be hind Orange 
Coast College wi th a ti me of 5:50, but wa~ 
di squalifi ed when U Davis (third, wi th a 
time of 5:56) pro tested due to an obstruc· 
ti on ea rli er in the race. 

"The guys ha ve worked vcry hard thi s 
year," Head Coac h Mike Fillipone ~aid . 
"John Wang and John Roosend ahl I who 
coached most of the guys las t year] have 
done a grea t job preparing them. and th ey 
have responded . We' rc try ing to go oul 
there and make e ve ry olher sc hoo l beat our 
I i me." 

"II' the Dav is coach wants to prnlest for 
the second pl ace Is lotl. it 's his Ipreroga-
ti ve !, " Fillipone sa id. "My job is to make 
sure we race the fas test race poss ible and 
not worry about how everyo ne e l ~e is do· 
ing. 

All Smiles: The Tri ton 's Varsity eight crew enjoys its s econd place at State . 

Thi s past weekend, the women's cre w 
team trave led north to Marina Del Rey to 
compete in the Mill er Cup Rega tt a. whi ch 
featured \3 of the top co ll ege squads in 

Southern California plus UC Davis and 
Santa lara. The Tritons sent four boats to 
the competit ion and ca m..: home with IIn -
pressivc resull s and opt imism for Ihe fu -
ture. 

won il s first-round heat and in the grand 
fin al ro wed it s way to a ve ry impressive 
fourth · pl ace fini sh. 

The Tri tons also fi elded a second Nov-
ice eight crew that competed separately in a 
fin al onl y and matched the performance of 
their Icamm3tes hy crossing the fini sh line 
fourth . 

The format o f the Millcr up, a n event 
that ha~ evolved Into an un offi cial reg ional 
championship , consisted of a senes of heat 
races I'rom which boats qualifi ed for cilher 
the grand final, the petite fin al or the conso· 
lation final depending on resu ll ~ 1'1 0 111 the 
heats. 

The marquee boat for UCS D. the va rsity 
eight , placed second in it s heat and ad-
vanced to Ihe petit e fin al. In the fina l, the 
TrilOns rowed away from the competition 
to win the race and earn fiflh -place overa ll 
fi ni sh. 

For CSD, th ..: top performance of Ihe 
day ca me from its varsity four crew, which 
won its heat and moved on to compete in the 
grand fi na l. Faci ng a field of the top boats in 
Ca li fo rn ia. the Tri ton ~ were at their pea k in 
the waters of Ba lona Crcck, and captu red 
Ihe overa ll championship . 

"In particular with the Varsi ty, I was 
qui te pleased with the way things came 
out ," CSD Head Coad. Jack Va llerga. "It 
would havc been nice to make t h ~ grand 
fina l (i n the Varsil y eight race), but winning 
the peli te fin al means th at you go home 
remembering the lasl race as a wi nner rather 
than coming in behind someone else." . _ 

Together: UCSD (middl e) finshed five seeonds ahead of Sacramento State. In the Novice eight cO lllpetition, U SD 

Nexi up for the Tri tons is a duel meet 
against U LA. The final event on the sched· 
ule, though, is the most important forUCSD. 
On Ma y 17 and 18, the women wi ll compete 
in the Paci fi c Coasl Rowing Champi onship, 
an event that wi ll determi ne whether the 
T ritons parti cipa te in NCAA postseason 
play. Thi ~ b..:i ng the first yea r of N AA 
reguluti on, UCSD must compete wi th squads 
from all di v i s i o n ~ .

beaten Claremont and Pomona. We 
need to have a gocxi week of practi ce 
to get ready. It wa~ dl~appointing to

Q: Arena formerly 
known as RIMAe UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Continued from page 20 
merly known as RIMAe. 

Everyone know s that 
Quaicomm wins with the dca l, 
but so would the entire commu -
nity . 

UCSD students will benefit 
from thi deal greatly . Every 
student wi ll feci pride well up 
in hi s throa ts w henever he 
boots-up Quaicomm' Eudora 
tocheek his e-mail. Angry revo-
lutionary students wi ll have a 
corpo r ate emp ire to ra ll y 
agai n t in the tight agai nst capi-

ta �i sm . Other people thai sup-
port the move could gi ve it a 
cute nickname - Iet's go to 
tire "Q" to work OUI! 

No w, maneuvers like thi s 
take time to be hammered out. 
I can understand if some tu -
dents and faculty are leery of 
th is dea l, but i t 's because they 
don't have my vision. If you 
had my in tellect and under-
standing of the ways of the 
world, you wou ld sec that my 
proposal is the most beneficia l 
action to be taken on thi s cam-
pus in years. 

However, unders tand that 
thi s is mearl y the misunder-
stood wri tings of a sport s ge-
nius who will never be appre-
ciated ~n hi s own tim e. 
Qualcomm Arena is definitely 
better than A lberto's No. 12 
Field or Dairy Qu een 
B l izzardDome. 

Eitherthat. or we can get the 
money from the A .S. 

Women's Lacrosse 

Thi has been a historic sca on 
for Ihe UCSD women's lacrosse 
team. For the first time in school 

history , UCSD captured 

., 

the league ti tle and fi n-
ished the cason unde-
feated . UCSD closed out 

the regular season with 
wi ns against Claremont and 

UCLA on con ecut ive day and 
headed into ihe playoffs as the No. 
1 ranked sq uad. 

On Sunday, UCSD defended 
its ranking by fac ing Whittier Coi -
lege, with the winner traveling to 
the Fi nal Four in Berkeley . An 
aggressive offensive attack al -
lowed UCSD to score in the fi rs t 
minute of action. After falling be-
hind 2- 1, UCSD surged back to 
score five unanswered goal and 
take an 11 - 10 lead into hal fti me. 

I n the second hal f. UCS D 
stepped up i ts level of play and left 
Whi tt ier in i ts wake. The Poets 
had no answer for Sian Bei lock. 
who anchored the C D offen e 
and seemed to score at wi l l. The 
fina l 20 minutes of the match fea-
tured phy sical play from both 
teams and by the time the smoke 
cleared , UCSD had tallied a 24- 14 
wi n and had earned a trip to Berke-
ley . 

Facing ri val Claremont last 
weekend, UC D used its impres-
si ve comhi nation of swarming de-
fense and high-octane offense to 
lake control of the match. 

On offen e,·Beilock led the way 
with four goa ls and gave the 
Claremont team matchup prohlems 
throughout the day . Arny Haselfeld 
notched a hat- trick of her own, 
whi Ie Marissa Bell and Kat ie 
Ga lvin each burned the Claremont 
defense for t wo goals. In total , 
UCSD had ni ne different players 
score on the way to a 16-9 win. 

T he fo llowing day, the Bruins 
of UCLA came to town and were 
met by a fired -up UCSD squad. 
From the opening minutes of play, 
UCSD wa clearl y the dominant 
squad and rarel y allowed the Bru-
ins to approach the UCSD goal. 

Once again Beilock led the way 
on of fense, no tching six goals and 
dismantling the Bruin defense. 
Beilock was not alone in destroy-
ing UCLA, though, as her team-
mates scorched the nets for 20 
goals. 

Haselfe ld repeated her previ -
ous day's performance wi th three 
goals and Ga l vi n scored two more 
of her own. 

W hen the fi nal horn ounded. 
the Bru ins were able tocrawl horne 
after taki ng a 20-2 whipping from 
UCSD. 

Adding to the uccess of thi s 
season was th e fac t that four mem-
bers of Ihe UCSD squad were re-
cent ly named to a national team 
th at wi ll travel to Pennsy lvannia 
to play with the country's best.

Cycling 

When select ing an area for a 
cycli ng event , most riders wou ld 
not choose a desert as the idea l 

_

location . But a desert 
was exactl y whcre 
the UCSD cycli ng 
team found it self 

competing. They trav-
eled to the Mojave Desert tocom-
pete in the UCLA Road Race on 
Saturday before moving on to 
the more comfortable ett ing of 
Long Beach on Sunday. 

Fa ing a tough desert wind 
along wi th the heat, UCSD man-
aged to handle the clements and 
perform quite well in its final 
regular-season race. In the men' s 
A race. Lee Lefkowitz led UCSD 
over the 14-mi le circui t, f inish-
ing in si xth place. 

Jenny Eyerman. a recent ad-
dition to the women's A di vi-
sion, responded with a powerful 
performance to fini sh in eighth 

place. 
The men' s team continued to 

show its strength in the C divi -
sion. UCSD took places third 
through sixth to dominate the 
race. 

The highlight of the day was 
in the men 's D race when UCSD 
ran a textbook race to crush its 
opponen ts. Four UCSD riders 
took contro l during the second 
halfof the race. For the rest of the 
race, M ark Chaisso n, Justin 
Forbes. John Martin and Dave 
Schurig held their positions at 
the front, placi ng fi rst through 
fourth. 

Sunday did not prove as pleas-
ant for UCSD. as only four of 17 
r iders managed to score. 

UCS D nex t travel to Stanford 
to compete i n the Regional Cham-
pionships. where the young squad 
is looking to put together another 
strong performance on the road.

Down 1-0 in their hal f of the second, the 
Tritons hegan to play very aggressively. Mark

tied the game. 

"We had pressure on them al l game," right 
fie lder Jon Goldsmi th said. " We forced them to 
make errors In key 'pots and we took advantage

error by the left fi elder c leared the bases. When

Tri tons were ahead 4- 1. 

T hey picked up Rondestved t on a ground

The Tri tons made it 6-1 in the fourth when 
they got another run on a Hill sacrifice ny that
