In an attempt to compensate for a 
potentially debilitating funding defi-
cit, the A.S. Council will run a referen-
dum next week asking UCSD under-
graduates to increase their quarterly 
campus activity fee by $19.82 begin-
ning Spring Quarter of this year.

If approved, the referendum 
will channel the majority of the 
proposed activity fee increase into 
A.S. Programming and A.S. Student 
Organization Funding, along with 
other expenses and enterprises over-
seen by the council.

Councilmembers are spending 
this week and the next on Library 
Walk informing students about the 
referendum and asking for their sup-
port. Other campaigning activities 
have included contacting each student 
organization and visiting with college 
councils in a bid for endorsements. 

“From the colleges, we have 
received official endorsements from 
Revelle College and Marshall College,” 
A.S. Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Naasir Lakhani said. “This 
is not to say that other colleges are 
not supportive, but they just have not 
taken an official stance.” 

While the A.S. Council as a whole 
has no official stance on the refer-
endum, many councilmembers are 
involved with the pro side of cam-
paigning.  

“A.S. is not allowed to use funds 
related to their positions to campaign 

either for or against the referendum,” 
Assistant Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Frank Carroll said. “There 
is equal funding available to students 
both for and against the referendum 
to campaign, but the money set aside 
for the con side has not been, as of 
yet, utilized.” 

So far, $1,800 has been spent in 
general election advertising, with 
another $1,000 expected to go toward 
other logistics such as voting tables.

“We are picking up right where 
we left off last quarter and hitting the 
ground running,” A.S. Vice President 
of External Affairs Lisa Chen said. 

Councilmembers attribute the 
current funding deficit to a budget 
that has remained largely unchanged

The Moores Cancer Center at 
UCSD and San Diego State University 
began collaboration last month on 
a project aimed at examining dis-
parities among cancer occurrences 
in various races. The project is being 
funded by a $15 million grant from 
the National Cancer Institute, one 
of three such grants awarded nation-
wide last year.

According to NCI reports, there 
are significant differences in the rates 
at which certain types of cancers 
affect individuals of different races, as 
well as the mortality rate among these 
individuals. For instance, the institute 
has reported that while Caucasian 

women have a higher chance of devel-
oping breast cancer, black women are 
more likely to die from the disease.  

Dr. John Carethers, a co-principal 
investigator on the project and chief 
of the gastroenterology division at 
the UCSD Medical Center and the 
Moores Cancer Center, is compar-
ing the occurrence of colon can-
cer among blacks and Caucasians. 
Through the study of colorectal 
tumors, he hopes to determine why 
blacks are at greater risk for the dis-
ease. Other researchers will examine 
the effects of chemical derivatives 
with possible anticancer agents as 
well as nanotechnology-based vac-
cines for colon cancer.

Carethers said that these person-
alized studies could help provide new 
approaches to treating cancer over 
the next several decades.

“We will be able to take your 
genetic material and be able to opti-
mize the best treatment based on 
your genetic background,” he said. 

Carethers added that the develop-
ment of this new medicine will be 

similar to the development of thera-
pies for diabetes or AIDS, during 
which researchers found effective 
treatments for diseases that were pre-
viously considered unmanageable.

Under the conditions of the NCI 
grant, the project also stresses com-
munity outreach to better serve all 
San Diegans. Dr. Elizabeth Klonoff, 
psychology professor and co-prin-
cipal investigator for the project at 
SDSU, said the project aims to facili-
tate a better understanding of cancer 
research among medically under-
served minorities. The grant will also 
assist in producing medical-consent 
forms in multiple languages to serve 
a wider spectrum of patients. 

The partnership study is projected 
to last five years, while individual 
projects for studying specific cancers 
will last two to three years. After this 
period, new projects related to the 
study may be developed if the initial 
projects yield significant results. 

Carethers said that one of the 
project’s most daunting challenges 
lies in training researchers. Students 

selected to participate in the project 
have the opportunity to receive a 
certificate in cancer research through 
SDSU as part of a training program 
offered by the grant.

“There is definitely a shortage 
of people doing cancer-disparities 
research,” Carethers said. “That’s a 
challenge, especially in a five-year 
time period.” 

Koloff added that the project will 
greatly increase the number of faculty 
and students participating in new 
cancer research efforts at both uni-
versities. 

The SDSU-UCSD Cancer Center 
Partnership is the only partnership 
in California funded by the NCI. 
According to Koloff, each university 
will receive roughly $7.5 million. The 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 
Houston and the Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center in New York 
received funding last year for similar 
research.

A new law school opening at 
UC Irvine will offer three years of 
free tuition to the incoming class 
of winter 2009. Tuition for students 
accepted in subsequent years will be 
at a standard rate.

The UC Irvine School of Law, 
California’s first public law school 
to open in over 40 years, expects 
to enroll about 60 students in the 
founding class. Funding for the ini-
tiative will require roughly $6 mil-
lion and come entirely from private 
donations. 

According to Director of 
Communication and Public Affairs 
Rex Bossert, the university is about 
one-third along in the path to acquir-
ing the necessary funds. 

“We’re substantially far along 
in that process,” Bossert said. “I’m 
fairly confident we’re reaching that 
amount.”

The university has received an 
additional $24 million in private 
donations for student scholarships 
and endowed faculty positions.

The university hopes that incen-
tives such as the promise of free 
tuition, a curriculum focused on 
public interest, a prestigious faculty 
and a 3-to-1 student-faculty ratio 
will attract top law students from 
across the nation.

Founder Dean Erwin 
Chemerinsky, who credits the civil-
rights lawyers of the 1950s and 
’60s as his legal inspiration, says 
his intention is to have the school 
recognized as one of the top 20 law 
schools in the country from the first 
time it is ranked, an effort he says 
will begin the day the school opens 
its doors. 

“Our goal is to be the best in the 
country at training lawyers to prac-
tice at the highest levels of the legal 
profession,” Chemerinsky said in a 
statement. 

Since the Standards and Rules 
of Procedure for the Approval of 
Law Schools by the American Bar 
Association stipulates that a law 
school cannot be considered for 
accreditation until its second year 
of operation, the school must wait 
until its second year to apply for 
accreditation.

However, according to Bossert, 
provisional accreditation during the 
school’s second year of operation 
will allow the students to take the bar 
exam in any state. Full accreditation 
is allowed after the school has been 
operating under ABA standards for 
two years. Achieving full accredita-
tion is a three- to five-year process.

The University of California 
Board of Regents has scheduled 
a joint meeting via teleconference 
on Jan. 14 to discuss a proposal 
to limit freshman enrollment this 
fall with the expectation that the 
state budget will be insufficient 
for the number of students UC 
had hoped to enroll. 

UC President Mark G. Yudof 
will release an enrollment plan 
later this week but details have 
not been finalized, UC spokesman 
Brad Hayward said in a state-
ment.

“It’s an unfortunate impact 
of the state budget situation,” 
Hayward said. 

During their November meet-
ing, the regents threatened 
unspecified limits on future fresh-
man enrollment. Yudof suggested 
that one solution might be to 
deny more students entrance into 
their first-choice UC campuses 
and instead offer admittance to 
underenrolled campuses such as 

UC Merced. 
An estimated 127,000 students 

applied for admission to at least 
one of the nine UC undergraduate 
campuses for the fall 2009 term, 
up from 121,005 last year. 

UC officials report that the 
5 percent increase has set a 
record for the highest number of 
applications in the University of 
California’s history, adding that 
it will likely amount to a record 
number of rejection letters sent to 
high-school seniors and transfer 
students. 

UC Board of Regents Chairman 
Richard Blum said in a statement 
that the governor’s plan to cut UC 
funding was forcing the university 
to take drastic action, calling the 
state an “unreliable partner.”

UC officials have said that stu-
dents who have been turned away 
from the university could spend 
their first two years at commu-
nity colleges, many of which are 
already struggling with booming 
enrollment.

“One day it was going to hap-
pen,” Blum said. “We’re supposed 
to be getting $10,000 for each 

additional student, and we’re not 
getting it. If we can’t pick up these 
kids, hopefully the community col-
leges can. At the end of the day, 
you still get a UC diploma.”

A record number of 63 UCSD 
students have been accepted into 
the Gates Millennium Scholars 
program this year. 

Sponsored by the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation, the 
program was established in 1999 
to help eliminate financial barri-
ers for students from ethnically 
underrepresented groups. 

Students who demonstrate 
high academic and leadership 
potential, as well as a commit-
ment to community service, are 
nominated by principals, teach-
ers, counselors, tribal higher-edu-
cation representatives and other 
professional educators.

“Gates Millennium Scholars 
represent some of the most out-
standing and gifted students 

attending college today,” Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue said in a statement. 
“UC San Diego is honored to 
have such a large number of these 
uncommon scholars among us. 
Noted for their creativity and drive 
as well as their intelligence, Gates 
Scholars are sure to make a posi-
tive impact in the UC San Diego 
community.”

Eligibility for the GMS program 
is limited to blacks, American 
Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian 
Americans, Pacific Islanders and 
Latinos who are in the process of 
completing undergraduate stud-
ies in all discipline areas or gradu-
ate work in mathematics, science, 
engineering, education or library 
science.

Rue said the investment made 
by the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation will insure that these 
students have the support they 
need to thrive in college.

“The commitment to diversity 
in higher education of the Gates 
Foundation matches the commit-
ment to diversity within UC San 
Diego,” she said.

since 1985 and a constantly increas-
ing undergraduate population, which 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Utsav Gupta said has 
led directly to the creation of more 
student organizations, many of which 
request funding from the council. 

The amount of funding requested 
by student organizations rose by 40 
percent between the 2006-07 aca-
demic year and the 2007-08 academic 
year, a rise that Gupta attributes to 
the council’s switch last year from 
paper funding requests to an online 
system.

The council typically funds about 
40 percent of a student organization’s 
event, enough to cover venue and 
sound-system costs.

“Without funding at 40 percent, 
this means that we are no longer 
funding the essentials to student orga-
nizations for their events,” Gupta said. 
“Because of this, funding at a level 
lower than 40 percent is the same 
as zero-funding the event. Failure of 
these events will put a very noticeable 

damper on student life as a whole at 
UCSD.”

Gupta added that if the referen-
dum were to fail before the student 
body, the most noticeable effect of the 
continuing deficit would be the qual-
ity of this year’s Sun God Festival. 

“If this referendum does not pass, 
there will not be a Sun God Festival 
this year — at least not one that con-
tinues a 27-year-old annual tradition,” 
Gupta said. 

The alternatives include hosting a 
vastly scaled-down event or canceling 
the festival altogether and preserving 
funds to stage the festival every few 
years rather than continuing to host 
an annual event.

Because not all students partici-
pate in campus organizations or A.S. 
Programming events, Chen said the 
referendum would also put money 
toward programs that have a larger 
scope than the UCSD campus.

“Even if you were to never step 
into an A.S.-sponsored event or are 
not part of any student organization 
on campus, the referendum goes to 

supporting the environment with a 
sustainability resource center, and 
going to increasing our presence 
in Sacramento and the regents that 
directly deal with policies affecting 
every student,” Chen said.

Gupta said the initiative for a sus-
tainability resource center would be 
another main beneficiary if the refer-
endum passes. 

“Sustainability is a movement that 
I feel is going to define our genera-
tion,” Gupta said. “The creation of a 
student-controlled, student-initiated 
sustainability center will consolidate 
sustainability efforts around UCSD 
and provide an essential resource for 
all students.”

He added that other A.S. pro-
grams, such as Safe Ride, are in dan-
ger of being cut altogether if the refer-
endum does not pass. 

In that case, councilmembers say 
that students can expect to see it again 
on the ballot during Spring Quarter.

Crescenzo at sdecresc@ucsd.edu.

Councilmembers warn that if the referendum fails to pass, A.S. will be unable to provide any significant funding to student organizations on campus.

Councilmembers were in and out of the fourth floor forum in just over an hour at last 
night’s A.S. meeting, which was pri-
marily devoted to brief discussion of 
various campus events and the A.S. 
activity fee referendum campaign.

During public input, Adam 
Timmerberg, president of the Deejay 
and Vinylphiles Club, explained 
the situation surrounding the “Let’s 
Bounce” event that the organization 
is hosting on campus Jan. 10 from 8 
p.m. to 1 a.m. 

“The event is 
amazing and is 
really a $30,000 
party that we 
got for $9,000,” 
Timmerberg said.  
“We were within 
budget but we no 
longer are within budget. We are actu-
ally over $2,500 over budget because 
the police really want to shut down 
the event.”

Timmerberg explained that DVC 
is asking the council for an emergency 
funding request of $2,500 to cover 
the cost of the increased security that 
the UCSD Police Department sud-
denly finds necessary for the event. 
Nevertheless, he informed council 
that the event would take place regard-
less of whether or not the organi-
zation receives the additional funds 
from Associated Students, adding that 
DVC is perfectly aware of the financial 
strain that will follow.

In an effort to make herself more 
accessible to students, President Donna 
Bean told the council that she would 
be lunching with Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue every other 
Friday in Price Center.

Since the A.S. activity fee referen-
dum was pushed through council at 
the end of last quarter, councilmem-
bers have been working furiously on 

the campaign for the special election 
that will take place next week.

“Should this wonderful referen-
dum pass, then we can book our artist 
for Sun God,” Associate Vice President 
of Programming Garrett Berg said.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy and Special Elections 
Campaign Manager Frank Carroll 
took the opportunity to provide a 
show-and-tell session of all campaign 
booty that is currently being used to 
get the attention of students, aka eli-
gible voters.

The book-
marks, flyers, 
and table toppers 
Carroll passed 
around the coun-
cil tables were met 
with approval, but 
the buttons pro-

duced by the A.S. Graphic Studio gen-
erated a significantly greater amount 
of enthusiasm.  There are 10 different 
button designs, most of which are 
graced with the popular bears of the 
Bear Garden posters holding up signs 
advertising the election.

After leaving his seat to show the 
council samples of the bear picket 
signs, Carroll returned to the table only 
to find some of his buttons missing, 
despite having passed around bags of 
buttons for councilmembers to swipe.

“I stand up for two minutes and 
four of my buttons got jacked!” he said 
in dismay.  

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Nassir Lakhani provided an 
update on the status of Che Cafe, which 
will remain closed until it acquires the 
liability insurance required to continue 
its operation and events.

Announcements regarding activity 
fee referendum info sessions at vari-
ous colleges and upcoming tailgating 
events rounded out the rest of the 
meeting.

means essentially the same as 
accreditation — they could take the

“We’ll do everything we can to get 
there. Our ABA consultant is tell-
ing us that we’re in excellent shape 
to get provisional

sible time. I can’t

F o u n d i n g

collaboration in 
building a school 
from the ground up. 

“Our students will find our cur-

said. “We expect our school is 
going to involve more collaboration 
between students and faculty, since 
we’ll be creating all the institutions 
from scratch.”

Fisk added that the school’s cur-
riculum will include variations on 

conventional methods of teaching 
law.

“We are very excited about the 
prospects for creating a top-20 law 
school here at UC Irvine,” Fisk said. 
“We are going to have an innovative 
curriculum that covers all the essen-

tial knowledge 
and skills, but 
that does so in a 
way more suited 
to modern legal 
practice than 
at most law 
schools, espe-
cially in their

According to the Internet Legal 
Research Group, tuition for all four

$35,000 and $38,000 annually.

THE STUDENT VOICE SINCE 1967

OPINION
THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 2009

When the A.S. Council set about drafting its emergen-cy referendum last quarter, 
the question that first came to mind 
was how our student government could 
possibly have managed to land itself in 
such an unfortunate monetary conun-
drum. The revelation that the previous-
ly well-endowed A.S. coffers contained 
virtually zero funding for Sun God and 
a rapidly dwindling supply of cash for 
student organizations came as a harsh 
reality check not only to the council, 
but to the many arms of our campus 
community that depend on A.S. fund-
ing to sustain their day-to-day activi-
ties. From Surf Club to Safe Ride, from 
the Koala to College Republicans, the 
pervasive effects of the council’s total 
fiduciary failure would be felt by all.

Now, as is so often the case when 
a government neglects to sustain itself 
financially, the burden of solving this 
monetary crisis has fallen squarely on 
the shoulders of the body politic. Thus 
it is time now for students to decide 
whether our quarterly activity fee 
should be raised an additional $19.82. 

While the initial (and very much 
justified) reaction of any student raised 
to believe in this university’s message 
of affordability might be the outright 
rejection of such a proposal, the coun-
cil’s dismal situation calls for the stu-
dent body to support this referendum 
so as to preserve the countless services 
and amenities our student government 
provides. Regardless of how this crisis 
came about and despite how opposed 
we might be to the notion of higher 
fees, students must now come togeth-
er to resolve this issue before we are 
forced to suffer the effects of a broke 
and broken council. 

It is much easier to swallow this 
referendum when considering what 
would happen were it to fail. Student 
organizations would quickly falter, 

unable to host the events that depend 
so heavily on A.S. funding. The Sun 
God Festival that we have come to 
cherish would, as councilmembers 
have so vehemently insisted, become a 
thing of the past, its replacement com-
ing in the form of smaller, potentially 
less frequent festivals. Council-spon-
sored services such as Safe Ride, the 
godsend of any stranded drunk, would 
be significantly tapered off. 

Yes, our council has truly found 
itself in a tight spot. Yet we cannot 
fault councilmembers for a lack of 
effort in attempting to solve this prob-
lem. They have, after all, put together 
a highly transparent, well-organized 
referendum, one devoted primarily to 
ensuring the future of some of our 
most important student interests. The 
council’s well-versed devotion to these 
interests is perhaps best illustrated by 
its intention to channel part of its 
requested bailout funds into the cre-
ation of a bigger, better student lob-
bying corps to represent UCSD before 
our state’s lawmakers in Sacramento.

Additionally, the inclusion of a 
consumer price index clause provides 
students with the peace of mind that 
no similar referendum will be neces-
sary in the foreseeable future, while 
guaranteeing that the council will pos-
sess enough funding to operate at full 
capacity. Be assured, the referendum’s 
language and breakdown give students 
the power to demand this money will 
generally be well spent. 

There are exceptions, of course. The 
council will allocate $2.34 per quarter 
of its requested funding increase to 
the upcoming campus Sustainability 
Resource Center. And while green ini-
tiatives should no doubt be a top prior-
ity for UCSD students, this venture 
appears pointless at best and waste-
fully ironic at worst. Organizers, who 
secured one-time start-up funding 
from administrators without any plan 
to sustain their sustainability center 
(remind us again why we should trust 
you with our activity-fee money?), have 
opted to ignore the campus’ numerous 
already-established green resources in 

favor of reinventing the wheel one more 
time. Though it seems only customary 
at this point for each of the council’s pet 
orgs to have its own center.

Ultimately, however, this fee 
increase does far more good than 
harm. Vote yes, and rest easy know-
ing the student body shouldn’t have to 
make this tough decision again.

Dear Editor,
I worked very hard to get into 

UCSD, and that does not just include 
doing well in high school, it also 
includes making sure I fulfilled all of 
the requirements in order be eligible 
for admission. So you can imagine 
my surprise when the UC Board of 
Regents decided to take up a proposal 
to eliminate the SAT II as an admis-
sions requirement. 

I am not the biggest fan of stan-
dardized testing, but my problem lies 
in the UC Board of Regents’ reason-
ing. To quote the minutes from the 
July 16 meeting: “Failure to take the 
required SAT subject tests or complete 
the ‘a-g’ curriculum properly — which 
may mean only minor variances — are 
major reasons for ineligibility, includ-
ing academically strong students.” This 
means that the UC Board of Regents 
figures, “many students are not taking 
the SAT II who would be eligible if 
we eliminated it, so let’s eliminate the 
requirement because some students 
are not taking it!” 

Former U.S. Congressman and 
UC Berkeley graduate Doug Ose dis-
cussed this logic in a recent op-ed.

“This staggeringly simplistic ratio-
nale raises legitimate questions about 
the wisdom of the regents’ willingness 
to consider admitting to the UC sys-
tem students who cannot understand 
the most fundamental step of entering 
college which is to apply for it,” Ose 
said. “The answer is for UC to better 
communicate its admissions require-
ments, not eliminate them.”

If students cannot figure out the 
steps to getting into college, why  
would I want that person as my class-
mate? They are only going to bur-
den an already overcrowded system. 
Many students who meet the require-
ments are already turned away, so 
why extend an invitation to those 
who do not meet even the most basic 
of criteria?

All of this does not even account 
for how much this new proposal will 
cost the UC system. The San Francisco 
Chronicle recently reported a loss of 
$1 billion to the UC endowment and 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is dis-
cussing millions of dollars in further 
budget cuts after the endowment has 
already been butchered once. This 
proposal will make thousands of more 
students eligible for admission and 
each one will require more attention 
because we will be losing a bench-
mark for admissions. This is going to 
create an even greater burden on our 
already stretched admissions system.

Basically, this proposal is seeking 
to eliminate admission requirements 
because applicants do not know about 
them. The consequences of applying 
this logic are disastrous. If we applied 
this backward logic to other things, 
we would end up with lawyers who 
think they deserve to get into law 
school because they did not know 
about the LSAT. For more informa-
tion go to www.saveucstandards.com 
and tell the UC Board of Regents it 
is out of touch. We do not need to 
dumb down the admissions process 
for the finest network of institutions 
in the country.

Dear Editor,
The chimes atop Geisel Library 

will ring out special premieres during 
January 2009. Keep in mind that the 
actual library entrance is the worst 
place to stand — you really need to 
walk onto Library Walk to get the full 
effect. These premieres were commis-
sioned by the UCSD Arts Library and 
are associated with the Ringing in the 
New Year exhibit at the UCSD Arts 
Library this month. Located on the 
lower level of the west wing of Geisel, 
the exhibit calls attention to the chimes 
atop Geisel Library.

UCSD’s carillon first rang out on 
Sept. 20, 1989. The instrument was 
a gift from educational patron Joe 
Rubinger, who saw our young cam-
pus’ need for the warmth and func-
tion of a carillon. Joe named it the 
Irene Rubinger Institute for Continued 
Learning Memorial Carillon, after his 
late wife Irene. The carillon chimes 
automatically on the hour from 7 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends. 
If you have any song requests, please 
direct them to spaulson@ucsd.edu.

Dear Editor,
Students will return from vacation 

to find themselves with a decision to 
make. Starting the second week of 
Winter Quarter, students will be able 

to vote on a referendum increasing 
the activity fee by $19.82 per student 
each quarter. After the hike, the cost 
for the campus activity fee will total 
$47.82.

The student activity fee increase 
will support UCSD financial aid 
needs for undergraduate students, the 
Sustainability Resource Center and A.S. 
Programming. The majority will go 
toward programming, student organi-
zations, services and operations of the 
Associated Students with a total of 59.2 
percent. UCSD financial aid needs will 
utilize 29 percent of the raise, while the 
remaining 11.8 percent will go to the 
creation, maintenance and operation of 
the Sustainability Resource Center.

Students can vote online at triton-
link.ucsd.edu and specific locations on 
campus beginning Jan. 12, 2009. For 
the referendum to pass, 20 percent 
of the undergraduate student majority 
must vote and if passed, the campus 
activity fee referendum will become 
effective starting Spring Quarter 2009. 
For more information regarding the 
A.S. campus activity fee referendum,

Behold: The United States Senate. An elected body full of men and women who have spent their 
entire lives dedicated to public ser-
vice. A shining monument to the ideal 
of democracy that the Western world 
holds so dear. One might think that 
each Senate member works tirelessly to 
win elections by his or her constituents 
and battles it out with the best politi-
cal savvy he or she could muster. No 

doubt our Founding Fathers imple-
mented strict rules and regulations in 
order to ensure that those who receive 
the honor of serving their country in 
a legislative manner would properly 
represent the will of the people.  

Unfortunately, if you have followed 
recent political news, you probably 
know there is more than one route to 
Capitol Hill — and these days politi-
cians are getting craftier than ever.  

Let us start our examination with 
everybody’s new favorite Illinois gover-
nor, Rod Blagojevich. With the election 
of Barack Obama as president and the 
subsequent vacancy of his seat in the 
Senate, the job of appointing a new 
junior senator has fallen to the crafty 
hands of Mr. Blagojevich. Like any 
proud capitalist, the governor seized 
this opportunity as a chance to extract 
as much material wealth out of the pro-
cess as possible. In essence, Blagojevich 
secretly perpetrated a silent auction 
of sorts to help choose a representa-
tive for nearly 13 million Illinoians. 
Unfortunately, when wiretaps and a 
federal investigation are involved, a 
silent auction turns into a very public 
auction. Needless to say, this alleged 
“pay-to-play” scheme has not been well 
accepted by the public and Blagojevich’s 
impeachment has been put into 
motion. But rather than cower in fear 
and shame, our man Blagojevich has 
remained defiant, recently appointing 
longtime democrat and Illinois politi-
cian Roland Burris to the position.  

Like most Americans, when I first 
heard of the Blagojevich scandal I was 
appalled. His actions represent all that 
is evil in a democracy. I was gear-
ing up to drive to Illinois and march 
on Springfield — until I saw him on 
television and fell instantly in love. 
Mr. Blagojevich sports a haircut that 
is simply second to none. The way 
his ultra-poofy hairdo refuses to blow 
in the wind defies all laws of gravity 
and is so impeccable that it must not 
be overlooked by the American pub-
lic. Only a political god could possess 
such a mane. I believe Mr. Blagojevich 
should be acquitted of all charges, 
appoint whomever he pleases and 
obtain as much money as possible in 
the process. Not since Bill Clinton has 
somebody so obviously guilty looked 
so damn confident on television. So 
what if the man he appointed to the 
Senate was never elected by the people 
and constantly talks in the third per-
son? Any friend of the Blagomeister is 
a friend of mine.  

Now let us turn to the political 
stronghold of New York and the vacant 
Senate seat of Madame Secretary Hillary 
Clinton. Apparently, the nickname

THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

“Empire State” is not just a motto but 
a way of life as Caroline Kennedy has 
emerged as a leading candidate to fill 
the position. Yes, that’s right. Caroline 
Kennedy is the daughter of former 
President John F. Kennedy and thus 
a member of the most fabled political 
family in American history.  

While the possible selection of 
Ms. Kennedy has elicited several com-
plaints, I simply see no credibility in 
any of them. There is no doubt that as 
a Kennedy, young Caroline is endowed 
with the same political DNA that has 
pulsed through the veins of her legend-
ary forbearers, making all accusations 

of inexperience and lack of qualifica-
tion meaningless. I for one am looking 
forward to the first day of Caroline’s 
Senate career and the security it will 
provide to all those who call the land 
of Camelot home. I am nearly con-
vinced that if there ever comes a time 
in our nation that a relative of the 35th 
president does not hold a place in gov-
ernment, the entire mechanism may 
malfunction. And with crazy Teddy 
seemingly on his way out, Caroline’s 
moment has come. All we need now is 
for Chelsea Clinton to be appointed to 
a Cabinet position and for Jeb Bush to 
be victorious in the presidential elec-
tion of 2016. Some may call it aristoc-

racy; I prefer to call it natural selection. 
If anything, the Blagojevichs and 

Caroline Kennedys of the world have 
taught young Americans an important 
lesson. If you can’t achieve your goal of 
a Senate seat through an old-fashioned 
election, don’t fret. Instead, marry into 
a well-known family or better yet, just 
find somebody who is willing to sell 
you a place at the table of the most 
exalted legislative body in the world. 
After all, as the old adage states: If you 
ain’t cheatin’, you ain’t tryin’. At least 
the American people can rest assured 
that if some of our politicians are not 
particularly trying, there are certainly 
a select few who are cheating.

It’s the first time “an
d Directed” was prin

ted in front of his na
me — ordinarily it’s

 just 

“Written” — and tag
ged to the end of “Sy

necdoche, New York
.” Yet these titles fit t

ogether 

with “by Charlie Ka
ufman” like floorbo

ards. 

With audacious gall
, Kaufman’s blend o

f magical realism an
d stagecraft yields a

 film 

that hurls itself into
 the bigger question

s that most director
s are too jaded to a

ttempt. 

Exploring new narr
ative structures, visu

al styles and eviden
tly industry vocatio

ns, it’s a 

visionary epic that l
aunches with the lar

gest ambitions and s
ettles with the most

 honest.

Following the saga 
of a theater directo

r transforming his 
life into a self-cano

nizing 

achievement (or so 
he hopes) on stage, 

“Synecdoche” soon 
wheels itself beyond

 the real-

ism of its first 30 min
utes and never quite

 returns. Though ma
ny critics decry its d

ifficulty 

and thorny exterior
, the film supremely

 models originality.
 While many other

 cultural 

achievements are c
ontinuously compa

cted into easy-to-u
nderstand, bite-size

 

pieces by Sparknote
s, Wikipedia and ev

en an Arts and Ent
ertainment 

section, it’s refreshi
ng to encounter a 

film too ambitious 
to 

compact any furthe
r. 

If anyone has deftly mastered the delicate art of making warm-hearted children’s 
films that adult sensibilities can cuddle (and ponder), it’s Pixar. And as the most popular 
number one of 2008 top 10 lists, “WALL-E” has certainly shown that big profits and 
critical acclaim can come in small, robotic packages if done right. 

On an abandoned Earth that looks like a decrepit L.A. in some 10-odd years, the film 
follows the self-titled, boxy, trash-collecting droid as he sifts through the oceans of waste 
excreted by our unsustainable habits. Yet careful not to wag a moralizing finger, Pixar’s 
allegory uses our inevitable future to nest a witty love story between its acronymic star-
crossed lovers, while keeping its speculative criticism to a minimum.

Although not having to hire voice actors was a pleasant relief for casting, “WALL-
E’s” reliance on animation is its most impressive feat. With visual gags and camera work 
used to convey most of its humor, the film glows with animation — energy, creativity, 
movement and above all, a genuine love for something we all grew up with.

The last time someone made the leap from princess to drug addict, Carrie Fisher 

lost her career. But when handled with care (and not actual narcotics), drugs can be 

a safe bet for anyone angling for an Oscar. As Kym, Anne Hathaway sports a choppy, 

cropped bob and over-applied eyeliner. She plays the bride-to-be’s younger sister on 

parole from rehab, desperately craving cigarettes and pity for her troubles — and all 

the while extorting emotional severance pay.

Getting off to a strong start before it even spreads along the screen, Jenny Lumet’s 

ability to summon a gamut of emotions from her screenplay is the film’s finest attri-

bute. Though your family is probably less eccentric than theirs, the relationships 

between sisters, parents and family painfully bludgeon familiar bruises. 

Compounded by Jonathan Demme’s austere technique borrowed from a 

belated Robert Altman, and jagged tracking (summoning him-

self “Dogma ’95” style) to put you in between the 

feuding family, “Rachel” is a chaotic 

affair — paradoxically 
lacerating, affectionate 

and transcendent.

After being released last year to the effete
 patter of film-festival applause, Gus Van 

Sant’s return to high school hallways wa
s given a limited release during the Ides

 of 

March in the United States, and thereafte
r quickly translated to DVD. Though mo

st 

know him for films like “Good Will Hun
ting” or the hugely successful “Milk” — n

ei-

ther of which he wrote — Van Sant has
 made his career and reputation on sma

ller 

films (“My Own Private Idaho,” “Elephan
t”) with far less narrative and a lush feel f

or 

time’s slow passing. 
In “Paranoid,” the slate and verdigris pale

tte of Portland’s darkly-clouded skies and
 

oxidized roofs frequently tint Christophe
r Doyle’s cinematography, especially in a c

ity 

rife with a youth culture equally as glum
 and dispossessed. With a quiet, soft-spo

ken 

Gabe Nevins as the film’s lead, it waxes 
rhapsodic as skateboards shave the conc

ave 

floor of parks like petrified kites capricio
usly ducking left and right. The kids do 

the 

same, hoping to miss the punches of adul
thood that fall too early.

With the pressure of an exponentially breeding indie mob from below 
— each one outsmarting the last, layering more fuzz, trumpeting more 
influences and further perfecting the little-girl voice until we couldn’t 
rightly tell the good from the bad guys — the mainstream had to pull out 
the big guns this year. Even the most devout hipster to innovative disso-
nance couldn’t avoid the bigger-than-ever T.I. synths, burbling stream of 
Lil Wayne masterpieces and a surprising feminine lean toward worship-
ping the independent woman. With such expansive exposure of both the 
underdogs and millionaires, 2008 left no excuse to wax wallflower. As 

follow, my favorite tracks of the year, for better or worse:

Good Christmas songs let us, like gospel and children’s lullabies, stay 
bundled in the comfort of warm, repeated harmonies while scoring a bay view 
of Winter’s coldest textures — icicles and bells and frosted lights and furry little 
animals covered in snow. From a quilted rocker next to the hearth, Fleet Foxes 
fashion a sad and pristine sort of holiday cheer, watching a pack of nondescript 
creatures “With scarves of red tied ’round their throats/ To keep their little 
heads/ from fallin’ in the snow,” digging up a long-lost childhood scare-tale for 
the most beautiful and festive of rural folk among 2008’s many throwbacks.

There may have been a horizonless fleet 
of newcomers trying their hand at grun-

young’un could ever churn those gears with 
the same diligence as Beth Gibbons and her 
two main men. After a panicked build of 
synthetic fuzz, mechanic chirps and nail-
on-chalkboard strings over drums fit to 
drive an old-world sacrifice, the noise is 
dimmed to a slow, fretty froth and Gibbons 
finally gives up what we’ve been waiting for: 
that full-bodied, sliding whine that rings far 
into the upper wings of the opera house but 
still never gets too pretty. There’s far catchier 
hooks all over Third, and “Silence” ends 
itself abruptly by cliffing off mid-churn, but 
— as they say, if I remember correctly — one 
cannot feel happiness without first having 
braved the storm.

From the moment the church organ rolled in, “Bleeding Love” —

The twisted scale/tempo zig-zag of Skeletal Lamping — Of Montreal’s

riffs in this year’s sea of ballads. The voice of Kevin Barnes, gayest non-
pansy in the biz, can find it difficult to avoid leaping kitschy and over

“I don’t know how long I can hold on/ If it’s gonna be like this forever.”

and all those who wish they weren’t (since remixed for the charts, 
laden with a mushy beat and benefitting only from Lupe Fiasco’s 
verse) was the cutest squirt of funk this side of the urinals.

Though Weezy all but overshadowed the thriving Dirty South 
scene this year — thrown national by UGK and the Clipse in 2007 
— the nether states still hosted a hot stew of home runs on ground 
level, led by Slim Thug’s cash-driven crew of Outlawz, embrac-
ing an addiction to the high life on the impossibly hot “Living 
Without,” over a beat that almost brings the stutter into fashion.

Though he’s recently reached the ripe age of 51, Nick Cave is 
the only thing we’ll have left when all the dirty old folk’n’rollers are 
gone — Springsteen and Waits are pushing 60, and lord knows 
Dylan’s on his last leg, if still kickin’. Cave approaches the best of 
each, and all that between; here, the trusty Bad Seeds help him 
sink a tooth into America as he knows it — on terms of gullies and 
tumbleweeds, never forgetting the yellowed heat of his homeland 
down under. “Don’t you love my baby?” he asks an unrelenting 
growl of bass, more than likely just outside your window.

Officially replacing “to the

tually everywhere — grocery store, 
dive bar, anywhere you feel like pointing at 
things — and, with a beat rivaled in depth 
only by last year’s “What You Know,” it’s easy to 
forget the rest of the album is even better.

TALENTO DE BARRIO · MACHETE/EL CARTEL
Yeah, so the movie was predictably shit, as with most other rapper-

turned-actor debuts before it. But what emerged from under “Talento de 
Barrio” was far worth the flop — a fat piñata (excuse my politics) of thrill-
ing reggaeton for the kiddies, the best from Yankee since “Gasolina.” 

SEEING SOUNDS · INTERSCOPE

Deerhunter managed what so many of their peers in the 
Radiohead wakewater drowned in bore-masking dreaminess 
on a new-age double disc for the ages. The voice begging for 
shelter throughout “Agoraphobia” is not quite used to the 
microphone — it’s flat, persistent, lingering a little long in earnesty. 
That’s because guitarist Lockett Pundt goes there, and even through the rest of 
the set is gurgling in shapely yet slender standouts, we never forget that plea.

antly amplifies the a

ura of

ilk’s passionately dem

ocratic vision. 

As a San Francisco

 even as he narrate

Keeping on with his success in marionetting the dark-winged avenger for a new audience of 

cynics and comic-book junkies, Christopher Nolan’s studio godsends have collected more than 

enough money from an eager box office congregation. 

Knowing their audience, nocturnal spectacles capitalizing in exploding vehicles, festering 

corruption and all-too-common criminals are given fodder in any Batman film. But slipping 

new blood into the formula, two charismatic men enter Bruce Wayne’s life who manage to also 

steal the show for the remaining film. And yet, as intriguing and “thought-provoking” as their 

quips and nihilistic pontifications are (investigating their theories through pseudo-philosophi-

cal terrorism), Joker and Dent are ultimately flat characters stuffed up with 80 percent personal-

ity and 20 percent curious conceit.  As its title hints, “The Dark Knight” harkens back to the noir textures that first sculpted Batman into the menacing antihero of the film. And with a little help from combustible special effects, both leave audiences spellbound with anticipation for the next issue.

The pith of director Kelly Reichardt’s stripped approach to filming 

“Wendy and Lucy” is undoubtedly her keen ability to sublimate an asphyxi-

ating melancholy from only her frail heroine and the Pacific Northwest. 

Following a homeless Michelle Williams as she struggles to find her dog, 

Lucy, before moving on to Alaska, “Wendy and Lucy” abandons the luxury 

of a polished presentation for simpler tools.
Though the film slipped unheard of during the holiday season, it’s a stony 

cut outfitted modestly in plainclothes realism that refuses to direct anyone’s 

feelings anywhere. Stitching scenes together with a mix of long shots, a pho-

tographic fixation and few cuts, “Wendy and Lucy” effectively consecrates 

itself entirely on William’s acting (similar, though more radically to “The 

Wrestler”). That said, Reichardt’s tale of a dejected loner in the wild heart of a 

spiritually unaccommodating world is a pretty cold character sketch that still 

manages to seep in and paralyze emotions like quicksilver.

On a sunnier note that takes its cue from Bollywood’s hyper-happy glow, 

one of the year’s most underrated films follows a diamond-in-the-rough urchin 

blessed with a “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” shot at love, fame and for-

tune.
Filming abroad for lack of a better inspirational landscape, director Danny 

Boyle mines the fibrous, over-populated and lower-income barrios of Mumbai 

with febrile kinetic energy. Whether the camera is hustling through a city 

thrumming with life or snooping the dark underbelly of India’s streets, it packs 

nearly every composition with abundant buzz.
But beyond the bustling street scenes, “Slumdog’s” shiny puppy-love story 

ushers its sentimentalism with a kitsch crux. Though it’s eastern Romeo-and-

Juliet appeal adds forced prostitution into the mix, it centers the film’s uplifting 

thrust (a first for Boyle) and lends it the perfect touch of heroic climate.

To say that the 1950s didn’t have its crop of revolutionaries is a tad underrating — it had 

them, they just settled too early and too easily to shake off suburbia’s crippling sedative after 

they bought a house. As two yuppie New York bohemians who did just that, Frank and April Wheeler’s saga 

investigates the lobotomy of romantic and liberal ideals that bourgeois conformism entreats. 

Working from Richard Yates’ lauded novel, it isn’t hard for “Revolutionary Road” to choreo-

graph emotions according to narrative strings. However, the film manages to do it while boast-

ing a skillful ply of cinematography and steady control of compositions. 

Though the review for “Revolutionary Road” is scheduled for next week, its limited release 

in the States earlier in the year puts it in competition with other 2008 runners. And while direc-

tor Sam Mendes has certainly learned to trust his actors a little more and manipulate his scenes 

a little less, he’s going up against fellow directors not afraid to alienate larger audiences.  

By contrast, Darren Aronofsky wields far less pretentious clout than in his last 
film, “The Fountain” in a relatively unpretentious change of heart (and style) for the 
studied director. A gruff, visceral film that is undemanding and straightforward, the 
brutal melee of overly-tanned brawlers and failed body builders depicts the glamour 
of professional wrestling by focusing on a pared-down character study of Rodney “The 
Ram” Robinson.

Rather than alchemizing brutality into poetry as Martin Scorsese had, Aronofsky 
doubles back on his screenwriter and with a protagonist less introspective than La 
Motta (at least by the end of his life), the Ram doesn’t find spiritual redemption as 
easily. Relying on Robert Seigel’s minimalist script instead, Rourke’s acting is given the 
most weight on the screen, with which he can hopefully pull himself up by his own 
bootstraps in the next decade.

N.W.A. fans) tandem. The differ-
ence should then come down to 
defense, and while Brian Dawkins 
leads a strong Philadelphia effort, 
emerging superstar Justin Tuck 
has made up for Michael Strahan’s 
retirement and should help the 
Giants continue their playoff win-
ning streak.

Joe goes with: Giants 24, Eagles 
20.

Panthers vs. Cardinals
When the Panthers pulled off 

a miraculous last-second win in 
week one, they had given them-
selves either the start of a sea-
son-long reclamation project, or 
simply an early adrenaline rush 
that would turn into their sea-
son’s only highlight. Quarterback 
Jake Delhomme, returning from 
injury, and wide receiver Steve 
Smith, returning from a one-game 
suspension after punching team-
mate Ken Lucas in the face, helped 
Carolina achieve the former. With 
DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan 
Stewart teaming up in the back-
field to produce the hottest duo 
in Carolina since John Edwards’ 
affair, the Panthers stormed all the 
way to the NFC’s second seed and 
a first-round bye. While their team 
makeup looks solid, especially with 
Julius Peppers again proving domi-
nant on the defensive line, their 
season is marked with less-than-
spectacular victories. While its sea-
son included a 34-0 romp against 
the Kansas City Chiefs and a 24-9 
win against the Atlanta Falcons, 
Carolina allowed 22 points to the 
Detroit Lions, scored only three in 
a loss to the Bucs and was killed, 45-
28, in a rematch against Atlanta.

The good news for the Panthers 
is that they are facing the Arizona 
Cardinals who, prior to their win 
last week against the Falcons, limped 

into the playoffs with losses in four 
of their final six games. Arizona 
benefited from playing in a divi-
sion in which it got dual wins over 
the Seahawks, Rams and Niners. 
Kurt Warner has looked amazing 
at times, but also mistake-prone 
and is always just one hit away 
from fumbling the entire game. The 
defense was surprisingly stout and 
disciplined against the Falcons, but 
on the road might return to its 
over-aggressive ways that allowed 
opponents to score 20 points or 
more in 11 games and resulted in 
a 56-35 loss at the Jets and a 47-7 
devastation at the Patriots.

Warner and the Arizona offense 
might be able to stay close in a bat-
tle of former NFL Europe quarter-
backs. However, the Panthers pres-
ent a more complete team. Having 
already defeated the Cardinals dur-
ing their regular season matchup 
in London, Carolina has shown the 
ability to overcome a big passing 
day from Warner and still pick up 
the victory. With the added ben-
efit of home-field advantage, the 
Panthers should be able to end the 
Cardinals season before people in 
Arizona start expecting something 
out of their football team.

Joe goes with: Panthers 38, 
Cardinals 28.

Titans vs. Ravens
As the last undefeated team in 

the NFL, the Titans were the ben-
eficiaries of much-deserved regular 
season recognition following early 
season turmoil after the meltdown 
of former Rookie of the Year and 
Madden Cover quarterback Vince 
Young. With a punishing defense, 
an explosive rookie running back in 
Chris Johnson and a veteran quar-
terback who knows how to run an 
offense without committing game-
killing mistakes, the Titans seemed 
to have a Super Bowl-worthy reci-

pe. In fact, it’s the same recipe that 
the Baltimore Ravens employed 
when they won Super Bowl XXXV 
in 2000. While Jamal Lewis might 
have resembled LenDale White in 
size more so than Johnson, both 
teams relied on a defense-first phi-
losophy that worked in the regular 
season and for Baltimore proved 
punishing in the playoffs.

These Baltimore Ravens have 
been compared favorably to their 
2000 counterparts. While not as 
dominating defensively as the Super 
Bowl-winning squad, the team still 
has a dominant secondary led by a 

Pro Bowl safety (this time Ed Reed 
instead of Rod Woodson), a strong 
line with a huge body in the middle 
(the way-more-fun-to-say Haloti 
Ngata instead of Sam Adams), and 
Ray Lewis serving as the heart, 
soul and mouthpiece, even if he’s 
not replicating his Defensive Player 
of the Year and Super Bowl MVP 
season from 2000. Furthermore, 
using the running back trio of 
Willis McGahee, Ray Rice and 
Le’Ron McClain has allowed the 
Ravens’ offense added flexibility 
on the other side of the ball, even 
if offense still remains Baltimore’s 
weakest link.

The biggest difficulty for the 
Titans is that other teams are now 
more prepared than they were 

at the start of the season for the 
Tennessee style. Playing that style 
against a team equally intent on 
controlling the clock can also be 
difficult. While it’s risky to trust a 
rookie quarterback as the Ravens 
have done this year with Joe Flacco, 
minimizing his attempts will also 
minimize his opportunities to make 
mistakes. Tennessee also must real-
ize that its defensive line with post-
injury Albert Haynesworth and 
Kyle Vanden Bosch is not as con-
trolling as the pre-injury version. 
The year might no longer be 2000. 
It’s Flacco and not Dilfer on the 
other sideline. Instead of proclaim-
ing herself “Bootylicious,” Beyoncé 
is now punching midgets in the 
face. Mel Gibson cares less about 
“What Women Want” and more 
about stealing dreidels and com-
menting upon the sugar content of 
female officers’ “breasticles.” The 
year may have changed, but the 
Ravens still know how to punish 
Kerry Collins.

Joe goes with: Ravens 16, Titans 
13.

Steelers vs. Chargers
For the Pittsburgh Steelers, hav-

ing a first-round bye and being 
the favorite to advance to the AFC 
Championship game should come 
as no surprise. After being upset 
in last season’s playoffs by the 
Jacksonville Jaguars, the Steelers 
have been strong both offensively 
and defensively. Despite injuries 
to running back Willie Parker, 
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger 
and lacking depth after the season-
ending injury to rookie Rashard 
Mendenhall, Pittsburgh contin-
ued to roll throughout the season 
with all four of their losses coming 
against playoff teams and only one, 
a 31-14 defeat at Tennessee, appear-
ing lopsided. James Harrison is the 
first defensive player in a long time 

to receive legitimate MVP-hype 
after leading the league’s best defen-
sive unit, and even Mewelde Moore 
was able to find success behind the 
Steelers’ offensive line.

For the San Diego Chargers, 
things were not supposed to go 
this way. After beginning the sea-
son as a popular Super Bowl pick, 
the Chargers sputtered to a 4-8 
record and seemed destined for 
an early first-round pick and the 
merciful end of the Norv Turner 
Era. However, after rolling off 
five straight wins, including two 
straight elimination game victories 
in the regular season finale over the 
Denver Broncos and in the playoffs 
against the Colts, San Diego is just 
two wins away from what could 
be its first Super Bowl appearance 
since 1994. Phillip Rivers trumped 
Dan Fouts for the best season by 
a quarterback in team history and 
simultaneously proved his Pro Bowl 
worth, saving Turner’s job.

The Chargers no doubt have 
momentum on their side and the 
team is finally playing up to its 
talent level and somewhat meet-
ing expectations. Unfortunately, no 
matter how great he has looked 
recently and how hard Chargers 
fans might try to convince them-
selves otherwise, Darren Sproles 
is not LaDainian Tomlinson. Even 
if the Steelers have to play with 
Byron Leftwich instead of Ben 
Roethlisberger, the Chargers are at 
a greater disadvantage playing with 
Sproles instead of LT. San Diego’s 
greatest shot is if its team keeps 
playing with the same what-do-
we-have-to-lose mentality against 
what might be an overly confi-
dent Pittsburgh squad. The only 
upside is that if the Chargers lose, 
maybe they can still get rid of Norv 
Turner.

Joe goes with: Steelers 28, 
Chargers 27.

SWIMMING & DIVING — It 
has been one year since the Triton 
women last faced off against Loyola 
Marymount University in a dual meet, 
and the Tritons have not forgotten 
their bitter defeat at the hands of the 
Lions. Although this season’s team fea-
tures several new players, the leftover 
feelings from the close defeat have not 
diminished.

“Not to take anything away from 
LMU, but it was a hard loss to swal-
low,” head coach Scott McGihon said. 
“We really hope to pull out a win this 
year.”

Last year, the Tritons and the Lions 
both won seven individual events, 
with the Triton women taking two 
relays. Unfortunately for UCSD, it 
was not enough to overcome Loyola 
Marymount, who bested the Triton 
women 131-128. 

“That was a horrible loss,” senior 
captain Aubrey Panis said. “We did 
not put our best performance in the 
pool that day.” 

In last year’s competition, Panis 
was a member of the first-place 400-
yard medley relay and she looks to 
recapture that race when the two 

teams meet again on Jan. 10. 
With only one senior from last 

year’s team, and a flood of new tal-
ent, the Tritons are ready to sweep 
the Lions. 

“We’ve been training really hard 
and have a lot of talent on the team 
this year,” Panis said. “We beat them 
by almost 100 points at Nike Cup 
earlier this season, so we’re going to be 
racing hard this time to win.”

The Tritons maintained an inten-
sive workout regimen over win-
ter break that included workouts of 
14,000 yards in the pool in prepa-
ration for their meet against Loyola 
Marymount.

“We’ve been training really hard 
these past six weeks and haven’t had 
competition since the Nike Cup [in 
November],” McGihon said. “We’re 
really excited for our first meet of the 
year and our first conference home 
meet of the season.”

The swim meet on  Jan. 10 begins 

at 11 a.m. at Canyon View Pool and 
pits the UCSD women, equipped with 
a lot of young talent and speed, against 
the Lions, who have not been nearly 
as competitive with the Tritons this 
season in collective meets such as the 
Nike Cup. The Tritons have a chance 
to start off four straight weekends of 
competition with a victory. This time, 
the Tritons will be seeking revenge in 
their own pool — an advantage they 
did not have last time the teams met.

“We didn’t have a great meet last 
year,” McGihon said. “But, we have a 
strong team this year and hopefully 
can pull out a win.”

Also this weekend, the men’s swim 
team will be hosting Grand Canyon 
University on Jan. 11 at 11 a.m. and 
there will be a knockout round for 
UCSD Spirit Night during the inter-
missions of the meet.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Head 
coach Kevin Ring has orchestrated 
great things with the men’s volley-
ball team, a program that has expe-
rienced tremendous growth during 
his time at the helm. Entering his 
third year, Ring hopes to improve 
on a season in which the Tritons 
won a school-record 10 matches, 
beat powerhouse UCLA for the first 
time and knocked off defending 
national champion UC Irvine in 
both meetings. There’s still plenty 
of room for improvement, however, 
as the Tritons only finished 10-19 a 
season ago.

Ring’s players are quick to note 
the impact he has had on the team. 

“The turnaround of this pro-
gram has started with recruiting,” 
senior libero and All-MPSF per-
former Eric Leserman said. “Coach 
Ring has done a great job bringing 
in the players needed to compete 
year in and year out. The influx of 
quality players has been responsible 
for us closing the gap in our confer-
ence.”

Despite last year’s breakout sea-
son, the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation coaches  picked UCSD 
to finish 11th in the conference, 
three spots short of a playoff berth. 
The MPSF is full of teams that are 
in the national championship con-
versation, a position the Tritons are 
still trying to attain. Pepperdine, 
last year’s national runner-up, and 
UCLA tied for the poll’s top spot, 
with Long Beach State, Cal State 
Northridge and UC Irvine round-
ing out the top five. Pepperdine, 
UCLA and UC Irvine have all won 
national championships in the past 
four years. 

“Our goal this year is to make 
the playoffs for the first time ever,” 
Leserman said. “With the group we 
have coming back, we are optimistic 
that it’s a feasible goal.”

Hasty preseason predictions 

aside, the Tritons have the founda-
tion intact to continue their rise 
as an emerging volleyball program. 
Last year’s record-breaking squad 
lost one senior and will return 
another All-MPSF performer in 
Jason Spangler. Spangler, a junior 
outside hitter, led the team with 
489 kills, tying for the third-highest 
total in school history. Meanwhile, 
senior defensive specialist Leserman 
has set the UCSD single-season 
record for digs in consecutive years, 
with 267 as a sophomore and 282 
last season. Leserman also currently 
owns the career dig mark with 667. 
Leserman points to Ring’s simple 
defensive philosophy for his suc-
cess.

“Coach preaches that the defense 
should never let the ball hit the 
ground,” he said. “I’ve spent my 
time doing the best I can to uphold 
that, and it has resulted in tremen-
dous success on the defensive end.”

The Tritons also welcome back 
Will Ehrman and Adrian Guthals, 
two veteran starters who were 
severely missed last year because of 
injuries. Ehrman was second on the 
team with 328 kills as a freshman in 
2007, and will have the opportunity 
to reclaim his position as an offen-
sive stalwart alongside Spangler. 
Guthals has proven to be a quality 
blocker up front. During his injury-
short freshman campaign, he led 
the Tritons with a .316 hitting per-
centage and 1.24 blocks per game. 

The Tritons will host all of the 
conference’s powerhouses starting 
with UC Irvine on Feb. 25 and 
UCLA the next day. Pepperdine 
stops by for an appearance at 
RIMAC Arena on March 7. These 
matches mark opportunities UCSD 
must take advantage of if it hopes 
to continue its ascent. Ring and 
the Tritons open their season at 
RIMAC against Hope International 
on Jan. 9 at 7 p.m.

ON DECK

The 2008 NFL season was one for believers. Who would have believed that Kerry 
Collins would be more relevant 
than Tom Brady? Who would have 
believed that a 4-8 team left for dead 
would become a 9-8 team advanc-
ing to the second round of the 
playoffs? Who would have believed 
that Brett Favre would actually get 
his due criticism for playing like 

crap? Who would have believed 
that the star wide receiver of the 
defending Super Bowl champions 
would take a gun to a nightclub in 
the waistband of his sweatpants and 
subsequently shoot himself in the 
leg? As the 2009 NFL playoffs move 
forward, eight teams remain, trying 
to make believers out of a growing 
group of football fans.

Giants vs. Eagles 
The NFC East has been argu-

ably the best division in football 
throughout the year, even when 
considering late-season struggles 
for both the Dallas Cowboys and 
Washington Redskins. With that 
in mind, it’s no surprise that two 
NFC East squads meet in the sec-
ond round of the playoffs. The 
Eagles have considerable experi-
ence in advancing to (and more 
often than not, losing in) the NFC 
Championship game. The Giants, 
meanwhile, are the defending Super 
Bowl Champions. However, while 
the Giants flew under the radar 
last season, even as they made their 
way to the Super Bowl, they are 
more appropriately regarded this 
season.

As the only remaining NFC 
team that made the playoffs last 
season, the Giants have the most 
recent experience in this type of 
situation.

Unfortunately, the Giants are 
also the only team missing one of 
its best players. For all the distrac-
tions that Plaxico Burress might 
have caused, the wide receiver was 
nonetheless the source of much-
needed swagger for a team with a 
quarterback in Eli Manning who is 
about as intimidating as Mike from 
the Life cereal box.

The Eagles have been on one 
of the biggest rolls in the NFL, 
particularly since the benching and 
subsequent re-emergence of quar-
terback Donovan McNabb. With 
running back Brian Westbrook 
healthy and a group of receivers 
—including rookie Desean Jackson 
— that is the best since the ill-fated 
days of Terrell Owens, the Eagles 
have enough offensive weapons 
to compete with any team in the 
league. After losing to the Giants in 
week 10, the Eagles come into this 
game with the confidence of having 
defeated New York on the road dur-
ing their week 14 rematch.

Westbrook remains the single 
most explosive player on either 
team. However, the Giants counter 
with not a single back, but three in 
the Earth, Wind and Fire (or Cube, 
Dre and oft-forgotten M.C. Ren for

and Cal Poly Pomona
Jan. 9-10

The men’s basketball team  
takes to the court this weekend 
hoping to stay in first place in 
the CCAA, despite suffering its 
first loss in conference play to 
Cal State Dominguez last week-
end. Cal State San Bernardino 
was picked to finish first in the 
CCAA and will definitely pose a 
challenge for the Tritons, who 
were picked to finish seventh. 
Both teams currently boast 3-1 
CCAA records.
