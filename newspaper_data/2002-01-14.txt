Dean hired for 
medical school 
Kaushansky will take over after 
long search to replace Wasserman 
By THOMAS VINEBERG 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD School of Medicine 
named Kenneth Kaushansky, M.D. 
as its new chair Jan. 10. 
Kaushansky's appointment ends a 
long search to replace inn:rim 
chair Roger Spragg, who has head-
ed the department since former 
chair Stephen Wasserman left in 
June 2000. 

Kaushansky will begin as Chair 
and Professor of Medicine on Feb. 
I. He now serves as professor of 
medicine and adjunct professor of 
biochem.istry at the University of 
Washington, and chief of the 
hematology section at the 
University of Washington Medical 
Center. He is also editor in chief of 
the scientific journal Blood. 

Kaushansky says that "the repu-
tation of the school and 
Department of Medicine for out-
standing science applied to medi-

cine" brought him to UCSD. He 
has high ambitions for his term as 
chair. . 

"I want the department to be 
thought of nationally as the place 
to go if you want to be an out-
standing physician-scientist, a per-
son skilled in both the clinical and 
research worlds," he said. 

The department, he asserts , is 
"clearly on the right track." 

Kaushansky says that the med-
ical school is known for outstand-
ing science and the well-rounded 
clinical education its students 
receive, but that it still has room to 
improve. 

"By making certain that our 
students and residents are exposed 
to both types of teachers, outstand-
ing clinicians and outstanding sci-
entists who understand the molec-
ular basis of disease, we can do bet-
ter," he said.

New engineering building to be 
helped oy expedited state funds 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

Gov. Gray Davis has designed a 
proposal to quicken construction 
of several UC facilities, including 
UCSD's new Engineering 
Building Unit 3B at Earl Warren 
College. 

Davis announced the proposal 
at a UC Davis press conference. 
Under the plan, funds for the con-
struction projects would be provid-
ed in the 2001-2002 economic year 
rather than in 2002-2003 as earlier 
planned. 

Early funding for the UC pro-
jects is part of Gov. Davis ' 
statewide economic stimulus pack-
age. 

UC officials from Sacramento 
to San Diego praised the propos-
al. 

"Davis has proposed a wise, 
far-sighted investment in higher 
education for the benefit of the 
state 's overall economic health," 
UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson said. "The education 
and research that will occur in the 
completed buildings will be a cat-
alyst for California's economic 
growth." 

T he UC con truction projects 
will receive $279 m.illion if the pro-
po al is approved. EBU 3B will get 
$37.4 m.illion toward its construc-
tion. 

"rrhe proposal] would be an 

extremely good development for 
both the school of engmeenng and 
the rest of the campus," said 
Robert Conn, UCSD engineering 
dean. "This proposal will move 
forward the construction process, 
providing a new home for the engi-
neering and computer science 
departments. The old spaces in the 
Applied Physics and Math building 
will then be available for other pro-
grams." 

T he $37.4 ·million for EBU 3B 
in the governor's proposal is the 
same as originally budgeted. 
However, early financing will likely 
reduce the building's cost when 
inflation is considered. 

"The governor 's proposal is 
good news, as the advancing of 
funds will be very beneficial toward 
the project," Assistant Vice 
Chancellor Boone Hellmarm said. 
"Any escalation entertained 
between now and then will be 
obsolete." 

Along with the engineering and 
computer science departments, the 
87,000- quare-foot EBU 3 B will 
house the Warren college provost 
and the Warren college writing 
program. 

The new building wa expected 
to open in fall 2004. Faced with 
unexpected delays, it became possi-
ble that it would open 3 year later.

Dean: 
Kaushansky passionate 
about mediCine 
Continued from page 1 

He hopes to make the clinical 
experience "one in which the srudent 
or resident comes away from inter-
viewing and examining a patient and 
thinks, ' I wonder why that person's 
pancreas failed to produce insulin. 
Why did my patient develop 
leukemia' What gene is defective in 
the blood vessels causing the high 
blood pressure? How can I design a 
new molecule to shut off that defec-
tive gene? '" 

Kaushansky is deeply involved in 
1110st aspects of medicine . 

"\ very much enjoy clinical medi-
cine," he said . 

His pass ion for working with 
patients was evident as he talked 
about a recent patient. 

"The last patient 1 saw in my last 
clinic at UW was a 29-year-old man 
who I diagnosed about 18 months 
ago with acute leukemia," 
Kaushansky said. "We treated him 
with chemotherapy, and then recom-
mended he undergo bone marrow 
transplantation to make certain the 
leukemia didn't return. He came to 
me on Thursday for his one-year 
checkup after the transplant, having 
gone for a three-hour bike ride that 
morning, and his complete evalua-
tion revealed no evidence of the dis-
ease," 

While he may miss dealing direct-
ly with patients, Kau!hansky sees a lot 
of good in becoming the dean of 3 
medical school. 

"There is more to medicine, ways 
to make an even bigger impact than 
one patient at a time," he said. "By 
helping to teach the next cohort of 
physicians, to help advance the sci-
ence of medicine, all will reap the 
benefits ." 

Kaushansky completed his doctor-
ate at UCLA and joined the 
University of Washington faculty in 
1987. 

"When I entered medicine I was 
most intrigued by the biochemistry of 
it, and thought that it held a key to 
understanding human disease," 
Kaushansky said. 

"At the time, there were no other 
disciplines of medicine that knew 
more about their disorders at a mol-
ecular level than hematology. Some 
m.ight say this is still true today, we 
can diagnose anemias, leukemias, 
deficiencies of blood cell production 
at the si ngle gene level, at the 
nucleotide level, more frequently 
than in any other aspect of medicine," 
he s2id. 

His laboratory's work has focused 
on the production of platelets, the 
small anucleate cells responsible fOI" 
the first wave of blood clotting. 

"Many of our patients fail to pro-
duce sufficient numbers of platelets, 
and they bleed," he said. "We were 
involved in the initial cloning and 
characterization of the primary hor-
mone responsible for this process, a 
hormone called thrombopoietin. We 
hope that by understanding how it 
drives platelet production we will be 
smarter about how to diagnose and 

tre~t disorders of blood cell produc-
tion." 

Faculty are pleased that his exper-
tise will now be put to work at 
UCSD. 

"Dr. Kaushansky is one of the 
leading authorities in the world on 
the formation and growth of blood 
elements, such as plate lets," said 
Edward Holmes, vice chancellor for 
health sciences and dean of the 
School of Medicine. 

"He has been a pioneer in identify-
ing the genes which regulate these 
processes," Holmes said. "His accom-
plishments have been recognized by 
his peers across the nation. He is also 
a dedicated educator and leading 
spokesperson for the trai ning of 
physician scientists, a field in which 
the United States faces a critical 
shortage. UCSD is fortunate to have 
attracted such an outstanding acade-
mician and physician, and I am look-
ing forward to working with Dr. 
Kaushansl-y. "

UC moves to join the Fair Labor Association 
The University of Califomia's Office of Business 

and Finance announced Jan. 10 that it intends to join 
the Fair Labor Association while upholding its commit-
ment to the Workers Ri~ts Consortium. The UC sys-
tem's involvement with the two organizations is a part 
of its effort to improve labor practices among the com-
panies that make products bearing logos and trade-
marks of the university or its campuses. 

Since August 1998, the university used a set of 
labor guidelines for licensees that manufacture con· 
sumer products with UC logos or trademarks. In 
January 2000. the university revised its code when an 
advisory panel of faculty, students and administrators 
suggested that it strengthen its commitment to fair 
labor practices. 

The code specifies that university licensees and 
contractors uphold minimum workplace standards 
related to legal compliance, ethical practices and 
employment standards. The university has licenses 
with over 200 companies. including Adidas, Jansport. 
and Nike. 

UC Riverside begins search for 
chancellor's replacement 

UC President Richard C. Atkinson has appointed an 
18-member committee to advise him on selecting a 
new chancellor for UC Riverside. The committee. com· 
posed of UC Regents, students, faculty. alumni and 
staff, will begin work Jan. 18, when it meets to discuss 
candidates with leaders in the UC community. 

The nationwide search for a successor to Raymond 
L Orbach. who has served as UCR's chancellor since 
1992. began in December 2001. Orbach leh 
Riverside after he was nominated to head the Office 
of Science in the U.s. Department of Energy. Orbach 
is awaiting confirmation by the U.s. Senate. 

C Judson King. UC provost and senior vice presi-
dent of academic affairs; Bruce B. Darling. UC senior 
vice president of university and extemal relations; and 
Patrick Hayashi. UC associate presiden~ will act as con-
sultants to the committee. 

The committee hopes to select a new chancellor 
by April. 

Scientists find key protein in 
elastic fiber development 

Researchers at UCSD's Institute of Molecular 
Medicine have described the crucial role of a protein 
in elastic fiber development in the human body. 
According to the study, the fibulin-5 protein serves as 
a combatant against sagging skin, twisted arteries and 
some forms of chronic lung disease such as emphy-
sema. 

It is unknown how elastic fibers are developed 

and therefore no method of fiber regeneration is 
known. However, JMM's study has caused scien-
tists to speculate about future therapies to battle 
elastic fiber deficiencies and other characteristics 
of aging. 

Dr. Kenneth Chien served as senior author of the 
sludy which can be found in the Jan. 10. 2002 issue 
of the joumal Nature. 

Medical center plans trial of 
ADD and ADHT medicine 

UCSD Medical Center announced Jan. 11 a new 
clinical trial to test a new medicine delivery device 
used in treating Attention Deficit Disorder and 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 

The trial will test an experimental skin patch that 
delivers methlphenidate into the blood stream to 
patients 6 to 12 years old. Methlphenidate is a critical 
component of Ritalin, an ADD/ADHT pill. 

Researchers will examine how much the patch 
reduces the spike of methlphenidate levels in the 
blood stream aher Ritalin is ingested. Sudden and dra· 
matic shifts in methlphenidate levels cause side 
effects such as stomachaches. 

Trial coordinators said they expect the patch to also 
limit social stigma experienced by children associated 
with going to the school nurse's office to receive med· 
ication. 

Computer chips found to hold 
explosive capabilities 

Chemists at UCSD have discovered that silicon 
wafers, the raw material components in a computer 
chip, possess explosive properties and can potential~ 
be used in field research of chemical analysis or as 
power sources for miniature electronic sensors. 

Researchers in Dr. Michael J. Sailor's laboratory fell 
into the discovery when Frederic V. Mikulec attempt· 
ed to spilt a porous silicon wafer with a diamond 
scribe, resulting in a small explosion in Mikulec's face. 
The phenomena caught the researchers attention 
when the reaction produced a very clean-buming 
flame. 

Sailors staff is using a finely divided form of silicon 
for its project. The silicon nanocrystal has a maximized 
surface area, causing it to bum very quickly and thus 
causing a larger explosion. Silicon also have an advan-
tage over conventional types of explosives because 
they can be ignited electronical~, which in tum can be 
safer when building military explosives because they 
would not detonate if dropped. Technical details for 
some of the project's applications can be found in the 
January issue of the German-based joumal Advanced 
Materials.

The 2001-2002 UCSD budget includes 
funding for 1,000 more undergraduate and 
graduate students in computer science and 
engineering than the previous year. The 
increase is part of an eight-year plan to expand 
enrollments in those deparonents by 50 per-

cent and requires adding space . 
"Finding available space on campus is 

becoming increasingly difficult," Conn said. 
"There is a tremendous need for space and this 
proposal will benefit the entire campus." 

There are seven projects throughout the 
UC system that would be covered under 
Davis' proposal , all of them necessary to 
accommodate rapidly increasing student 
enrollment. 

Some projects in the other UC campuses 
include the new Life Sciences Building at UC 
Santa Barbara, the Natural Sciences Building at 
UC Irvine and infrastructure development at 
the new UC Merced campus.

gcratnbling tO and ro 
A shorter passing period means 
better use of UCSD's resources 

By ANDREW FU 
Staff Writer 

Sometimes it can be easy to forget 
where we are: at school. 

Especially when living on campus, amid 
all the fun and games occurring at UCSD 
- maybe I am just thinking about sleeping 
and skipping class - it's easy to forget that 
we are at an institution of "higher learn-
ing," and that above all it is the classroom 
education that we are here for. 

So, keeping in mind that the top prior-
ity at UCSD is supposed to be learning, 
the recent decision to sho rten passing peri-
ods between classes from IS to 10 minutes 
is not really as big an issue as its detractors 
make it out to be. 

Five minutes is not that much time to 
lose between classes, but in the big picture, 
those minutes add up. By tightening the 
class schedule, UCSD can open up one 
whole new lecture period, which new pro-
fessors, classes and students can certainly 
put to more use than a measly five minutes 
at a time. 

There are undoubtedly other things we 
could be more concerned abou t that are 
happening at our school than the depar-
tu re of those fi ve minutes. 

For the last four years, students have 
had the luxury of an extra few minutes to 
stroll between classes, stop to chat with 
friends or get a quick bite to eat. But the 
fact is, every other UC campus gets by on 
a 10-minute passing period. 

And in fact, UC Santa Cruz actually has 
70 minute class periods, which made me 
feel a little better about sitting through a 
50-minute lecture. 

Those extra five minutes are nice, I will 
admit. But there are plenty of times that I 
found myself getti ng out of class at 
Peterson Hall to head for Solis Hall, only 
to find that I had an extra 10 minutes to sit 
around and wait for class to begin. 

The reality is, UCSD is in the stages of 
trying to accommodate more and more 
students, and changes simply have to be 
made to alleviate the crunch for space. 

According to David Miller, associate 
vice chancellor of academic planning and 
resources, UCSD admitted 1,000 more 
undergraduate students than last year for 
the fall 200 I quarter, and Miller expects 
just as many next fall. 

"Somewhere, we must therefore find 
about 8,000 new seats, distributed among 
all sizes of lecture rooms at all hours," 
Miller sai d. "The 10 minute walk provides 
some immediate relief by utilizing some 
existing seats more often ." 

UCSD 's total undergraduate student 
enrollment was 16,496 in 2000 and contin-
ues to grow. Ultimately, the growth means 
either making room for new students, or 
having to turn away more applicants. 

In order to fill the new classroom space 
provided by the extra lecture periods, 
UCSD will also have to provide new pro-
fessors to teach the expanding student 
body, and Miller said that new staff will be 
provided to accommodate the needs of stu-
dents. 

"The primary goal is to make sure that 
students can get th e classes that they need, 
and are not just all placed into larger 
courses," Miller said . "New sections 
should be opened up." 

Shortening the passing periods to 10 
minutes is not just a way to torture stu-
dents by making us walk faster between 
classes; there is an academic purpose to the 
change. 

Miller stressed that the schedule change 
is only one of several administrative 

actions planned to increase classroom 
availability. Construction of more lecture 
halls is a possible future addition . 

But in the mean time, the added lecture 
period will provide more flexibility, and 
the shortened passing time between classes 
is one of many sacrifices that have to be 
made. 

Unfortunately for a lot of us, getting the 
classes we need also means having classes 
very early or late. But it hardly makes sense 
to have empty lecture halls sitting around 
for so much time when they could be used 
to house a larger number of classes. 

"There has been a sharp rise in utiliza-
tion of lecture halls at 8 a.m. and between 
5 and 6 p.m. in just the past two years," 
Miller said. " I think we will approach 80 to 
100 percent utilization of some of these 
lecture halls at these times very soon." 

UCSD is a rapidly growing school and 
there are a number of predicted problems 
resulting from increased enrollment, such 
as the shortages in parking and housing. 

Education should be the top priority at 
any school, however. 

Losing five minutes between c1asscs 
means not being able to stay after class to 
chat with professors, but that is what office 
hours are for. 

AJthough we may pay the price for con-
venience, what we gain is a wider array of 
t;lasses from which to choose and a fuller, 
richer and more physically fit student 
body. 

It is already difficult to navigate 
campus in the allotted time 

By JILL MIDDLETON . 
Contributing Writer 

The Academic Senate's decision to short-
en UCSD's IS -minute passing period to 10 
minutes has provoked outrage among stu-
dents who must already huff and puff to 
make even the trek between Warren Lecture 
Hall and Solis Hall. 

Student fury on the matter is slightly 
hyperbolic. Most students gripe about get-
ting between campus' most distant points in 
a mere 10 minutes and the resulting cut that 
will come out of socialization and snack time 
in that period. 

That trepidation is of questionable 
importance, but the rising plaint against the 
shortened passing period has its roots in 
more just reasoning. Though designed to 
ease scheduling problems and improve the 
university's ability to serve its students, the 
measure will probably also compromise 
UCSD's quality of education. 

It is likely that, come fall 2002, not as 
many students will be directly affected by 
the 10-minute interval as the number that 
currently dreads it. Those who are directly 
affected, however, will likely spread the ill 
results to the people who do manage to get 
to class on time. Imagi ne the current 
cacophony resulting from droves of late stu-
dents stomping into class, but multiply th.at 
number of people by 10. 

Students are most likely to be hard-hit in 
classes where professors give quizzes at the 

beginning. Arriving late due to circum-
stances beyond one's control will shave off 
quiz time in an already high-stress situation. 

Classes in which instructors take atten-
dance at the beginning of every lecture -
and you thought you would be rid of that 
phenomenon when you finished high 
school! - will also cost students their grade 
when they find they cannot even make it to 
lecmre before the W's are called on. 

And some professors' tendencies to speak 
well over their allotted 50 or 80 minutes of 
class time, already to the chagrin of frustrat-
ed and entrapped smdents, will cost people 
more time as they attempt to scarper off to 
their next class. 

It is one thing when YOll cannot be punc-
tual for class because you had to have that 
pre-O chem smoke outside York Hall. But 
when you are prevented from making it out 
of class in a timely manner, whether due to 
the instructor's overextended gabbing, 
pushy schoolmates who prevent you from 
snapping up the handouts at the front of the 
class, or traveling between lecture halls that 
are a half-mile apart, it is another matter 
entirely. 

To complain incessantly about the nega-
tives of the passing petiod chal)ge and fail to 
look at its positive points would be imperti-
nent. The extra five minutes gleaned from 
each passing period will facilitate the addi-
tion of another lecture hour, alleviating the 
stress on class size and scheduling. 

But this will mean another class at the 
end of the day, keeping irate students locked 
down on campus a while longer. UCSD 
already epitomizes decentrality and division: 
Soon its students' schedules will reflect that 
as well , when they have classes at 9 a.m., I 
p.m. and 8 p.m. 

The solution seems simple: If you have 
classes back-to-back that are far from one 
another, then take the shuttle , ride a bike, 
use inline skates or learn to sprint. It's hard 
enough, though, to nab a shuttle even in 
15 minutes, and bikes, the wily observer 
will note, are forbidden on shared path-
ways all over campus during peak hours. 
Unless we become Rollerbladers or run-
ners, it will be difficult to haul ourselves 
every which way next fall just to get to 
class on time. 

If there are any sixth-year students float-
ing around, they will remember their fresh-
man year, when the passing period was at its 
original 10-minute length. Undoubtedly, 
the university made do with 10 minutes, as 
do the other UC campuses, all of which 
adhere to the 10-minute standard. 

AJlowing a 15-minute passing period at 
UCSD was a particularly apt stroke of local-
ized decision-making. UCSD is the second-
largest UC campus, and it is more difficult 
to do here in 10 minutes what UC Berkeley 
students can accomplish in the same amount 
of time. 

In the end, perhaps this issue will become 
a nonissue. T he vexed student· populace may 
decide to take matters into its own hands 
and arrive for lectures in its own good time. 
When it comes down to it, most snidents 
would rather be five or 10 minutes late to a 
class about which they feel apathetic or dis -
like than care about adhering to an artificial 
and (to them) meaningless university-
imposed standard. 

If so, there is not much the university can 
do to stop students from defecting en masse 
from the first part of the lecture period. 

However, those to suffer in the end will 
not be from the university administration, 
nor the Academic Senate. After aLI, it is the 
students who are expected to be present for 
a 10-minute pop quiz at the beginning of 
lecture.

Alcohol addiction 
is not a disease 

T he wise men and women of the 
Academic Senate have 
harangued the masses. 

Addicts use the 'disease' excuse 
to escape blame and punishment 

In an e-mail sent to the UCSD 
community in December 2001 , the 
Academic Senate explained, "The 
Academic Senate Council has agreed 
with the campus administration that 
a return to the 10 minute class inter-
val is both necessary and justified. 
This change \vill go into effect \vith 
the scheduling of classes for the fall 
quarter of 2002." 

It seems necessary and justified, 
therefore , to put the Academic 
Senate's contention to the test that 
only 2 percen t of students will be 
adversely affected by the change. 

Warren and Revelle Colleges 
regularly house many students for 
both lectures and laboratories over 
the course of the day, and it would 
not be far-fetched to assume that 
more than 2 percent of the popula-
tion must trave} between the two 
areas at least once a week in adjacent 
periods. Many students have com-
plained that 10 minutes would be an 
insufficient amount of time to go 
between Warren and Revelle 
Colleges. 

However, since UCSD is an aca-
demic institution, such a theory must 
be put to a scientific test. 

I started around 5 p.m. sitting in 
an empty York Hall 2622, pencil and 
notebook open, and started my Stop-
watch. 

With a load of about 16 pounds, 
I set off toward Warren Lecture Hall 
2005, another large room in which I 
have had three classes over the years. 
At a brisk walking speed, using prop-

National Institute on Drug 
Abuse Director Alan I. Leshner 
summari zed the evide nce that 
long-term exposure to drugs pro-
duces addiction: "Taking dtugs 
elicits changes in neurons in the 
central nervous system that com-
pel the individual to take drugs, 
because these changes are pre-
sumed to be irreversible." 

If such changes are presumed 
to be irreversible, how does. one 
explain the millions of cases indi-
cating the reversibility of alco-
holism, all based on a person's will 
power and faith? It's not uncom-
mon to see people coming out of 
their alcohol addiction because of 
a religious conversion, inspiration 
from peers and authori ties, or 
simply believing they can do it. 

Thanks to NIDAS full-blown 
public campaign, the notion of 
alcoholism as a "brain disease" has 
become widely accepted. 

These absurd arguments and 
so-called evidence were not 
potent enough to brainwash me. I 
contend that alcoholism is not a 
disease; it is blatantly psychologi-
cal rather than physiological. 

Alcoholism is estimated to cost 
the economy $ 166 billion per 
year for specialty alcohol services; 
medical consequences; lost earn-
ings due to premature death, ill-
ness and crime; and crashes, fires 
and criminal justice. 

Alcoholism exacts terri ble 
social costs. In a recent year, there 
were 39,232 highway collision 

deaths, 'wd 17,790 of those were 
alcohol-related. 

In addition, alcoholism often 
leads to physical, economic and 
emotional abuse within families, 
causing untold suffering and 
numerous divorces. It has been 
estimated that alcohol contributes 
to 80 percent of fire deaths, 65 
percent of accidents to pedestri -
ans, 55 percent of arrests, 90 per-
cent of child abuse cases and as 
much as one-third of the suicides 
in the United States. 

These costs are acceptable to 
society and even arouse deep 
sympathy because the "disease" 
concept of alcoholism has led 
society to view damages caused by 
heavy drinkers as a product of the 
disease, not the drinker. 

The debate about whether 
corrections should punish or treat 
alcoholic criminals is a joke. That 
it is even an issue is an insult to 
our criminal justice system. 
Killers should have considered 
the consequences of their drink-
ing before the big night. After all , 
doing so just might have alleviat-
ed their punishment. 

Using the alcoholism-as-dis-
ease excuse and the benefits 
derived from it - such as lenien-
cy in court punishment - has 
offered heavy drinkers a psycho-
logical incentive to continue 
drinking. The doctrine that the 
alcoholic is helpless because the 
disease is hereditary prompts the 
idea that he might as well drink, 
since he lacks the a bili ty to

6 OPINION 

Money motivates all 
people and actions 
Attempting to ignore the role of 
money in society is fallacious 
By ANNIE PAN 
Contributing Writer 

I am mad about money. I love 
money with a burning passion, a 
blazing fervor and a perpetual 
craze. 

If it holds true that the eyes are 
the window to the soul, then my 
soul is overflowing with the beauti-
ful sight of money. My eyes contain 
no iris, no pupils - only the stun-
njng, shapely signature of money, 
with two strands of priceless pearls 
hanging from tip to tail. The dollar 
sign symbolizes unfathomable 
power: Money is omnipotent. 

How dare Hollywood make 
movies that incorporate underlying 
attempts to teach society morals by 
turning away from money? How 
dare teachers and parents try to 
pass on the value that money can-
not buy happiness? 

Fortunately, generations today 
are smart enough to block these 
evi l messages. It is truly a blessing 
that, as leaders of tomorrow, we 
have wlited to worship the 
Almighty Peso despite the wicked 
urgings from those against Him. 

Though money breaks up fam-
ilies, tears friendships and ruins 
spirits, living with it is still the 
greatest existence in the world. 

Those who claim their indiffer-
ence to money are living in a dis-
torted lie. As early as childhood, 
our every action is motivated by 
money. The reason we work hard 
as children is so we can get into a 

Otherwise, why is it that no one 
ever cares how much a student 
actually learns in school, and that 
the only thing that truly matters is 
the letters on report cards? This is 
because grades are supposedly the 
main determinant of one's success 
in the future - which, by today's 
standards, is measured by how 
much money one can lure into his 
pockets. 

It is obvious that grades give an 
inaccurate assessment of how much 
one actually learns. It is as easy to 
cheat and have sex with your pro-
fessors as it is to do something 
involuntary such as digestion. IfIet-
ters are the main component to get 
into college, to get into graduate 
school, to get a good job to make 
money, it is then true that all stu-
dents are motivated by money. 
College students are in school not 
for the sake of leaming, but for the 
sole purpose of initiating the long 
journey to Moneyland, the happiest 
place on earth. 

The myth that money cannot 
buy everything is absurd. Money 
can buy anything and everything in 
society, including love and family. 

When a woman first encoun-
ters a man, one of the 6rst ques-
tions to pop up is, "What do you 
do for a living?" It is ludicrous to 
think that a woman is actually 
interested in what a man does for a 
living. What is really being asked 
is, "How much money do you 
make?" If the man's response is in 
areas relating to doctors, lawyers or 

good college to get a good job to ------------
make money. See MONEY, Page 7 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Column: 
Passing period change 
makes students hotter 
Continued from page 5 
erly lit and paved paths, the journey 
took 13 minutes and 22.3 seconds . 

The Academic Senate is made of 
a number of very intelligent and 
learned people. As a result, I cannot 
see it imposing a rule that would 
result in students arriving late and 
missing three minutes of important 
instruction time. 

Brisk walking, then, must not 
have been the implied standard. I 
set off back for York from Warren 
still carrying 16 pounds, this time 
using a standard of full-out run-
ning. Although my level of physical 
fitness is probably fairly dismal , I 
did indeed sprint the full way, at the 
cost of near nausea, and made it in 
8 minutes, 3.4 seconds, well within 
the 10 minutes set by the Academic 
Senate. 

The 2 percent must refer to the 
poor souls who must sprint from 
Galbraith Hall in Revelle to EBU2 
in Warren. 

I therefore applaud the Academic 
Senate's decision. This is, no doubt, 
a thinly veiled a ttempt to force 
lethargic coUege students to exercise 
strenuously - perhaps even three 
times a week - in light of a report in 
the December 2001 issue of "The 
Economist" that nearly 4Q percent of 
Americans are overweight. 
Increasing the overall attractiveness 
of UCSD\; population, especially 
when the current population is com-
pared to the denizens of schools such 
as UC Santa Barbara and SDSU, is 
an admirable goal. This wri ter, how-
ever, fears and predicts that the strat-
egy will back6re when we all decide 
that we'd rather just stay in bed. 

D ec. 13, 2001: Did anyone else notice that day's two big headlines? The 6rst: The 

White House released its translation 
of the Osama bin Laden video tape 
that allegedly serves as proof for Bin 
Laden's involvement in the attacks of 
Sept. 11, 2001. 

Then, stifled under the "real" 
news, Bush formally withdrew from 
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, 
an agreement that Russia considers a 
"cornerstone" to nuclear arms con-
tainment. 

In response, the Russians are 
planning to tip their new missiles 
with multiple warheads - a fairly 
useless measure, but it's as much as 
they can do. The talk of a new arms 
race seems rather far-fetched; Russia 
has no inclination to dump ridicu-
lous amounts of money into fairly 
useless nuclear weapons when it 
could be spending money on slaugh-
tering Chechens, and nuclear silos 
are not on the top of the United 
States' list, either, when there are taX 
refunds to be had. 

The timing of it all seems rather 
6shy. If reports are to be believed, 
the White House probably knew of 
the tape sometime earlier in the 
week (Dec. 13 turned out to be a 
Thursday), and likewise, the previ-
ous Monday, Bush informed con-
gressionalleaders of his intent to pull 
out from the treaty. 

Funny, then, that the release of 
the translation of the tape had to be 
delayed a day from Wednesday to 
Thursday - the same day on which 
Bush announced his withdrawal 
from the ABM treaty to convenient-
ly smaller headlines. 

It seems that the "moral" 
Republicans, foremost among them 
Bush, who always blasted Clinton's 
improper use of international war-
fare and the su bsequent release of 

-information to cover his tracks on 
more lurid activities (read: attacks on 
Iraq and Serbia conveniendy coin-
cided with sex scandals), have taken a 
page from his book. Except this 
time, what's at stake isn't a president's 
sexual credibility. No, this time, 
we're playing with nuclear weapons. 

MONDAY, JANUARY 14, 2002 

L ast, a proposed resolution to UCSD's fall quarter equiva-lent to the Chandra Levy 
story (barely) bears mentioning. 
Regardless of Koala Editor in Chief 
George Liddle's insistence that all 
speech, no matter how galling, must 
be protected, it seems a massacre of 
the Koala's funding looms on the 
horizon. 

The Supreme Court shares 
Liddle's political view on free speech 
- unless, of course, one's speech 
constitutes a threat to national secu-
rity. In spite of the amount of atten-
tion bestowed by the college coun-
cils on this "crisis," the matter has 
yet to reach this degree of levity, but 
not for lack of trying. 

Therefore, in the spirit of the 
amount of marurity displayed by at 
least one side in this matter, might it 
not be wise to allow Liddle and 
Ernesto Martinez - who represents 
an irate student government - to 
settle their differences in a time-
honored tradition : the boxing ring? 

RIMAC Arena provides the per-
fect venue for such an event, and 
with the promotional skills of Jeff 
Dodge, our A.S. president, perhaps 
enough money could be raised for a 
decent WinterFest. 

While Liddle, leader of the self-
professed bastion of testosterone at 
UCSD, probably holds the upper 
hand by conventional wisdom, one 
might enjoy a scenario in which 
Martinez puts enough permanent 
dents in Liddle\; face that Liddle 
receives "relendess mockery of [his] 
physical deformities" in the press. 

Sadly, lack of hwnor and accom-
modation by both sides makes it 
more likely this battle will be fought 
in the far more boring venue of a 
courtroom. Too bad - with the 
coming loss of Thl Koala at UCSD, 
the campus could use all the excite-
ment it can get. God forbid that stu-
dents, especially those on the coUege 
councils, might actually have to get 
excited by schoolwork rather dun 
"politics."

Alcohol:

refrain. 

This is as ludicrous as the grow-
ing population that claims to be 
addicted to child abuse because it is 
in their genes to abuse their chil-
dren. 

There is certainly evidence that 
parents who are alcoholics have a 
higher risk of having children who 
will be alcoholics, but it only 
demonstrates a correlation, not 
cause and effect. For example, 
there is also data showing that par-
ents who dropped out of school 
have a higher chance of having 
chi ldren who will drop out of 
school. It is common sense to know 
that it is the influences of the envi-
ronment, not biological factors, 
that creates this problems. 

The same concept is also effec-
tive in its application to alcoholism. 
The biggest tragedy in society 
today lies in people's amazing abili-
ty to come up with nonsensical 
"evidence" to lessen their own 
onus. Even heavy drinking is affect-
ed by rational considerations.

This is why a rich man is never

man decides to walk down the aisle 
with the woman of his dreams, he 
has already entered a realm of secu-

ness," as has been done with alco-

their perpetuation. 

There are numerous indepen-
dent investigations conducted 
under controlled conditions show-
ing the degree to which alcoholics 
are capable of regulating them-
selves. 

Researchers found, for example, 
that the amount of alcohol that test 
subjects consumed was related to 
its cost and the effort required to 
obtain it. Once offered small 
bribes, subjects were able to refuse 
freely available alcohol. 

Other experiments showed that 
the drinkers' beliefs and attitudes 
about alcohol influenced how much 
they consumed. This is potentially 
very significant for drug addiction; 
the demand of alcohol is elastic, 
responding to the price. 

It's no wonder why the alco-
holism-as-disease model has such a 
firm standing in American society: 
Everyone likes it. Alcoholics like 
the theory because they get special 
status as victims and it frees them 
from their faults . People without 
alcohol problems like . it because 
they can tell themselves that it's not 
their problem because they don't 
have the disease. The treatment 
industry likes it because money

likes it because under this theory,

couple is free to abandon parental 
responsibilities, as long as they stuff 
their children \vith COWltlesS pre-

gifts have the power to buy affec-

than the alcohol. 

As long as it's always "not my 
problem," everyone is content. To 
prevent their self-images from 
plunging, people would rather 
engage themselves in a falsity to 
escape the truth. Denial may be a

society will eventually be pushed 
out of the fantasy land and have to 
face reality. The longer this denial 
drags on, the harder it will be to 
cope with reality.

pure propaganda. By down playing 
the voluntary dimension of addic-
tion , the preposterous model 
diverts from the great promise of 
tactics and therapies tha t rely on 
restrictions and rewards to create 
sel f-cor.trol. 

By strengthening a dichotomy 
between punitive and clinical 
approaches to addiction, the theory 
fl agrantly mocks the tremendous 
contribution of criminal justice in 
combating addiction. 

The fact that most addicts are in 
control of their own actions and 
appetites for de6nite periods of time 
serves as sufficient proof that they 
are anything but helpless victims of a 
chronic disease. They are the insti-
gators of their own alcohol depen-
dency, just as they should be the rep-
resentatives of their own recovery.

It is perhaps this challenging

Lecturers 
still trying 
for a new 
contract 
N egotiations are 
ongoing since '99 

DAVIS, Calif. (V-Wire) - A 
year-and -a-half after the contract 
covering UC lecturers expired, the 
Universi ty of California and the 
University Council-American 
Federation of Teachers are still nego-
tiating contracts and wage increases. 
UC lecturers last received a salary 
increase in October 1999. 

According to American 
Federation of Teachers negotiator 
and UC Davis medieval studies lec-
turer Kevin Roddy, the UC system 
does not consider lecturers to be fac-
ulty, adding that because of this, the 
university adopts an " indifferent" 
attitude toward lecturers. 

However, UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz said the university does not 
harbor negative opinions toward lec-
turers and noted the university has 
been steady in its effon to further 
negotiations with the union. 

UC officia ls have offered three 
different proposals to the AFT, the 
third of which they voluntarily sub-
mitted to the union, Schwartz said. 

In a university release, chief UC 
negotiator Peter Chester stated, 
"Since the union wasn't going to put 
a comprehensive proposal on the 
table, we decided to submit our own 
addi tional proposal, even though it 
means fo rfeiti ng certain leverage 
from a pure bargaining perspective." 

O ne issue is contract agreements, 
AFr's highest priority, which the 
AFT claims the University of 
California has ignored in its latest 
proposal, which focuses mainly on 
wage increases for lecturers. 

The union is tentatively willing to 
push aside the issue of increased 
wages until the two parties can com-
promise on a contract agreement. 
According to Roddy, without fixed 
employment terms, future services 
with the university remain uncertain 
for lecturers, allowing the university 
to make dismissals as often as every 
quarter. 

At the Nov. 30 bargaining session, 
the university proposed salary 
increases immediately rather than 
make lecturers wait until contract 
negotiations concluded. The propos-
al included a 1 to 2 percent salary 
increase and a guaranteed 2 percent 
meri t increase every three years for 
post-six-year lecturers deemed 
"excellent. " 

According to Rcxldy, the universi-
ty requested in exchange that lectur-
ers work under a short extension of 
the expired contract, which would last 
until June. AFT. rejected the propos-
al . Roddy added he feels the threat of 
a lecrurers' soike - of which there 
was much talk before winter break -
is heavy on the minds of UC negotia-
tors. 

Roddy added that the union's 
strike talks have not ceased entirely; 
he noted "[soiking] is one of many 
options, of which there are a whole 
spectrum of job actions we are con-
sidering." 

Schwartz said a leCturers ' strike is 
an action the university wi ll deal with, 
if necessary. 

"We' ll have to cross that bridge 
when we get there," he said. "[A lec-
turers' strike] is not in anybody's 
interest." 

UC Davis Associate Vice 
Chancellor of H uman Resources 
Dennis Shimek is loolcing forward to 
when negotiations are completed. 

"We will continue to work with 
interest in negotiating so we can have 
contracts by the earliest possible 
date," Shimek said.

'AFFIRMATIVE 
ACTION 

CAME AND WENT, LEAVING 
UCSD WITH A LEGACY OF 

CONFLIG AND COOPERATION 

BY SHARON SHAPIRO, 
STAFF WRITER 

Towlrd chlnp: Above, students march from the Price Center to the intersection of La Jolla Village Drive and Villa La Jolla in a March 1996 
protest against the California Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposition 209. Seven hundred students participated in this exercise of civil disobediance. 
and 18 were arrested. Above right, then· Governor Pete Wilson confers with UC Regent Ward Connerly at a regents meeting in San Francisco in 
1996. At this meeting, the regents reasserted their support of an end to UC-v.ide affirmative action. 

In the past 40 years, UCSD has cen a number of significant changes in the eth-nic makeup of both the faculty and the stu-
dent population. Known as a campus that is 
host to a Caucasian and Asian-America n 
majority, UCSD has historically lacked strong 
numbers of African-American, Native-
American , Mexican-American and Latino stu-
dents. 

The controversial issue of racial diversity 
has been debated by stud ents and faculty for 
yea rs, particularly surrounding affirmati ve 
action. 

The practice of using race o r gender as 3 
factor in employment and education became a 
matter of national importance in 1961, when 
President John F. Kennedy required that all 
government contractors take "affi rmative 
action" to expand job opportunities for 
minorities. This effort to improve the lot of 
those perceived as hampered by their gender 
or race became common practice. 

In 1978, affirmative action was first chal-
lenged in the U.S. Supreme Court in the 
University of Califon/ill v. Bakke case, in which 
the Supreme Court upheld the use of race as 
one factor in choosing among qualified appli-
cants for admission. However, in that same 
case the Supreme Court also ruled unlawful 
the practice of reserving 16 seats in each enter-
ing class of 100 for disadvantaged mi nority sru-
dents at the UC Davis Medical School. This 
apparent contradiction only fu rther clouded 
the issue as opponents and supporters of affir-
mative action became more voca l. 

The UC Regents took action when they 
voted to end all affirmative action in 1995, 
under resolutions SP- I and SP-2 . T his meant 
that the University of California would no 
longer use race, gender, ethnicity or national 
origin as a factor in the admissio ns process. 
This policy took effect in 1997 for graduate 
students and 1998 for undergraduate snldents. 

Regent David Flinn said during the regents' 
affirmative action hearing in San Francisco, 
"There is no dispute ... amongst this board, 
that diversity in the student body, in the facul -
ty, in the University of California is a very, very 
important thing. But I think what people 
(missJ sometimes is what it is that the other 
side is complaining about. " 

But this vote was not met \\~thout con ider-
able oppo irion . Students from III over the UC 
system protested a meeting of the regents tn 
1995 at which the regents debated the resolu-
tions, and rioting was feared, although the pro-
testers were peaceful. Those criticizing the 
policy caJled it racist and unfair. 

Another blow was dealt to affirmative

action in 1996 when Proposition 
209 surfaced . Followlllg the 
regents' lead, voters approved the 
Cahiornia Ci\il Rights Initiative in 

~o\"elllber of 1996. The proposi-
non stated that CalIfornia "shall 
not discriminate against, or grant 
preferen tial treatment to, any indi-
\~ dual or group on the basis of race, 
sex, color, ethnicity, or national ori-
gin in the operation of public 
employment, public education or 
public contracting." This would 
essentially abolish all affirmative 
action programs in the state in 
employment or education. 

[n March 1996, a student-run 
demonstration blocked the inter-
section of La Jolla Village Drive 
and Villa La Jolla Drive, disrupting 
traffic and refusing to disperse, 
according to police officials. 

Eighteen students were arrested. 
The student protestors also 

received publicity when they 
attracted former presidential candi-
date and Rev. J esse Jackson 10 visit 
and speak at UCSD in an anti-
Proposition 209 rally in October 
1996. In hi speech Jackson said, 
"We need a state that is color-
inclusive and color-caring, not col-
orblind. No rational person wants 
to be blind." 

T he following November, once 
the measure had been approved by 
California voters, another student 
protest against Proposition 209 
occurred when 40 students voiced 
their opinions through a cam-
puswide protest. 

Dressed in red T-shirts and 
green armbands, the students held 
a press conference in Revelle Plaza 
then marched through campus 
chanting, among other things, 
"Pete Wilson, you liar, we'll set 
your ass on fire!" They advocated 
university-wide noncompliance to 
the proposition: Their demands 
were not met.

Logistics: Chancellor Robert Dynes explains the effects of Proposition 209 at a 
1996 A.S. Council meeting. He deta iled a plan for forming a review committee 
consisting of staff, faculty and students. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Proposition 209 did find some 
student support. 

Then-Revelle junior Veron 
Stanley said, "When I was admitted 
I think there were only 90 black 
snldents on the whole campus, and 
that's kind of awl-ward . But obvi-
ously, if you 're not qualified, then 
get out." 

The most visible student 
activism, however, has continued to 
be in favor of fostering diversity 
through the reinstatement of affir-
mative action. While clear on their 
intent to comply with state law, 
UCSD's administration has heard 
these opinions and has souglit to 
address them. 

In general, the university has 
responded to such protests and ral-
lies about a lack of campus diversi-
ty with different university pro-
grams intended to help attract 
more applicants from underrepre-
sented ethnic groups and retain 
them by making the campus envi-
ronment more welcoming and sup-
portive. 

The steps are detailed in 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes' 10-
point Diversity Action Plan, which 
was proposed and enacted in 1999. 

Among the pledges for improv-
ing UCSD's diversity-promoting 
efforts are increasing the then-cur-
rent scholarship base three-fold, 
annually awarding $1 million in 
undergraduate scholarships by the 
year 2002. 

Dynes also pledged to form the 
Center for Research in Edur.ational 
Equity, Assessment and Teaching 
Excellence, a UCSD-designed, 
comprehensive initiative to 
increase the number of underrepre-
sented students who achieve UC-
eligibility to enroll at UCSD. The 
program would use outreach pro-
grams to target K-12 students. 

Another significant part of 
Dynes' Diversity Action Plan is the 
establishment of a UCSD Diversity 
Council. This council is not an 
administrative council; but rather, a

Touching: The Rev. Jesse Jackson greets students after an emotional speech in

council composed of faculty, staff 
and students, in the effort to repre-
sent many voices of the UCSD 
community. 

The Diversity Action Plan 
promised to increase funding for 
underrepresented clubs or groups 
on campus, such as the African-
American Student Union and the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgcnder Association. 

There are some signs that 
progress is being made as the 
administration would like. In 
February 2001, the . number of 
applications for underrepresented 
minori ties, in some cases, rose. 

However, as the number of 
overall applications rose as well, 
this may not reflect actual improve-
ment: In 2001 , African-American 
students submitted 3. 1 percent of 
the fall 2001 freshman applications, 
up only slightly from last year's 3 
percent; Mexican-American stu-
dents submitted 9.3 of the whole, a 
rise from 8.4 of the total freshman 
applications; and Latinos submitted 
3 percent of the applications 
received, the same as from the pre-
vious year. 

Many students feel that this has 
not sufficiently increased enroll-

ment of students from underrepre-
sented ethnic groups. , 

In March, students gathered in 
Price Center Plaza to support the 
reinstatement of affirmative action. 
The name of the rally, 52-33-28, 
refers to the number of African-
American freshman students 
enrolled in UCSD in 1998, 1999, 
and 2000 respectively. It drew 
attention to the continuing decline 
in minority enrollment, despite the 
swelling number of students com-
ing to the university. 

Perhaps responding to such 
concerns, in May the UC Regents 
voted to repeal SP·I and SP-2, ini-
t1aoves that banned affirmative 
action . However, this did not 
change the status of affirmative 
action in admissions beca use 
Proposition 209 is a statewide poli-
cy banning the use of affirmative 
action. 

But the symbolic gesture has 
earned praise. 

A.S. Vice President External 
Dylan de Kervor said, "Even 
though Prop. 209 is still in place, 
the act of rescinding SP-I and SP-
2 is a huge act of goodwill toward

I think it's important, because I think it

I like Torrey Pines. Theni's an area over

I think that we should be balanced social-

You don't have to be in school all day. You can 
take a nap when you're tired between classes. 

Baskin Robbins. You got to eat a lot of ice 
cream, but you couldn't eat too much ice cream! 
And they paid minimum wage. 

I really like working with kids, so I guess it 
would be an elementary school teacher. 

It's really important. [ think I'd be pretty 
unhappy if! didn't have people I love and who 
love me in my life. 

The beach! I live up in Northern California, 
and we have beaches there, but they're really 
cold . I still love it, but it's so much nicer to go 
to the warm, nicer beaches. 

I'm kind of upset we don't have it anymore. I 
don 't know if they were talking about getting 
it back or not, but I think we should have affir-
mative action. 

"Brave New World," by Aldous Huxley. I real-
ly related to one of the main characters, and it's

Reforming prisons. There's a lot of injustice. 

I hate it if someone tries to bring me down in any

I love the classroom environment. I am absolute-
ly enamored with education just in general. 
I was in the Navy for four long, painful , ardu -
ous years ... I've been out for a year now and I 
am so happy to be Ollt. 

Teaching. My dream job would be a position on 
the National Council on Education. 

Incredibly. I've been married almost a year now, 
and it rates right up there \vith eating, sleeping 
- it's one of those basic things you have. 

I love being by the ocean. The only good thing 
about the Navy was being able to be on the 
water. 

When it was introduced it was incredibly impor-
tant. However, now, my wife always Isays] she 
doesn't want there to be the 'question of, ' Did I 
get this job because I'm a woman" I'm against it.

My favorite book to teach to high school Stu-

that and it was fantastic. 

The abolishment of multiple-choice testing for 
purposes of retention, promotion or the allot-
ment of funds.

Diversity: 
UCSD minority enroll-

Continued from page 10 
the underrepresented students on 
our campus, and it's paving the way 
for future progress." 

Students rallied and marched in 
favor of affirmative action once 
again in October 2001. The partic-
ipants highlighted the falling num-
ber of African-Americans, Native 
Americans, Mexican-Americans 
and Latinos in UCSO's applicant 
pool - down from 13 percent in 
1997 to less than 2 percent in 2000. 

Although many UCSD stu-
Jcnts have decided that affirma-
tive action should be reinstated, 
legislators, the public and the 
courts continue to wrestle over 
this thorny issue of differing con-
cepts of fairness and opportunity. 
AJanuary 2000 Gallup/USA Today 
poll showed 58 percent of 
Americans favoring affirmative 
action for minorities and women, 
up from 55 percent in 1995 . 
Court rulings remain murky on 
the issue. And here at UCSD, we 
are living the debate - for better 
or worse .

Volleyball: 
UCSD loses to NAIA 
champion Cal Baptist 
Continued from page 20 
was a typical first game in that we 
were just finding our way and fig-
uring out what worked and what 
didn't." 

[n the second game, the Tritons 
again mustered up a lead deep into 
the set but just couldn't win the big 
points. With a 19- 18 lead, the two 
teams went back and forth scoring-
wise to tie at 23. 

After a service error by the 
Tri tons, Lancers star blocker Artur 
Kusio took the serve with a 24-23 
lead and served out the game, 30-
23, largely due to Lancer freshman 
Sergio Rose, who had seven kills in 
the game. 

The third game proved to be 
deja vu for the Tritons because 
UCSD enjoyed another lead of 19-
18 but lost in the closing minutes. 
Two seniors from Cal Baptist, Andy 
Pool and Matt Peacock, were 
blocking machines in the final 
game, combining to block the last 
balLand finish off the match 30-25. 

Perrine led the team with 10 
kills and three aces. He also con-
tributed three blocks to the cause. 
Waller played extremely well and

for us, but our guys did a good 
job," Lanthier said. "That team is 
so physical and so mature com-
pared to a lot of our young guys, 
but I thought we played well. We 
just didn 't do the important thing 
[tonight], which is make shots." 

With the win, the Coyotes 

had eight kills and two blocks . 
Senior outside hitter Griffin 
Cogomo finished with five kills and 
a team-high four blocks. 

Overall, the Tritons can be 
proud of the way they played the 
NAlA champions, but from the 
team's standpoint, winning is 
always within reach. 

"I think there was a point in the 
match where we could have taken 
control, but we did not serve well 
and we didn't take their hitters' 
shots too well- plus we gave them 
a lot of chances," Larsen said. "If 
you do that, you are not going to 
win too many matches." 

The Tritons drop to 0-1 on the 
season and will try to rebound at 
home against Division I power-
house USCJan. 18 and Pepperdine 
University on Jan. 19. 

"USC has a real good team with 
big strong guys, such as Brook 
[Billings] as a bona fide AlI-
American player," Larsen said . 
"That match will be really tough. 
The Pepperdine team is really 
well-touched and we know they 
will be well-prepared coming into 
the match, even though they have 
lost a couple players from last year. 
Each team has a different element, 
in that USC is an individual-ori-
ented team with strong players 
while Pepperdine is more team 
oriented." 

improve to 8-0, 13-0 overall. The 
Tritons are 2 -6, 5 -1 0 overall. 

Next for UCSD are road games 
against Chico State and UC Davis. 
But the Tritons will return to 
RJMAC Arena on Jan. 23 for a bat-
tle against Grand Canyon 
University. 

"We are still a year away from 
the [the maturity of the 
Coyotes]," Lanthier said. "But we 
are doing well with the talent that 
we have and we will remain a 
competitive force for the season's 
entirety."

OnJy one three pointer away 
from sending the game to over-
rime, the Tritons looked to Fok to 
t3ke the final shot. The team cap-
tain took the ball in her end of the 
coun, ran the length of the court 
and hoisted a desperate three-poi nt 
attempt as time expired. The shot 
hit the rim but bounced away as the 
Tritons saw their chance to win the 
game slip away.

However, the final shot was not 
without controversy. As Fok 
attempted her three-pointer, she 
seemed to be bumped by a Pomona 
defender and it appeared one refer-
ee agreed. 

"I felt a body as I took the shot," 
Fok said after the game.

saw it too. 

"Maya got fouled," Malone said. 
"You expect to get a call like that at 
home." 

Though the Tritons had a legit-
imate complaint about the last 
shot, everyone agreed situation 
shouldn't have been an issue. 

"We had a chance to beat them 
and we didn't take advantage of it," 
Malone said. 

The Tritons were back in action 
the following night, taking on the 
Coyotes of Cal State San 
Bernardino.

key, the Tritons eeked qut a 54-47 
win. But it wasn't easy.

minutes. 

But the Coyotes, who are 8-5 
this season and 4-4 in the CCM, 
did not give up. Led by forward

Basketball: 
Tritons end four-game 
losing streak 
Continued from page 20 

The 70-64 Triton victory over 
the 10th-ranked Broncos snapped 
UCSD's four-game losing streak 
and was the biggest upset in 
UCSD men's basketball history 
since moving up to Division II. 

With the loss, Cal Poly 
Pomona falls to 8-4 overall and S-
2 in league. 

"We believed in ourselves and 
[the team) JUSt did everything that 
we needed to do to win." Lanthier 
said. "It was a great win for us." 

It was UCSD's second victory 
in the CCM and its second 
straight victory at home. The win 
was a confidence builder heading 
into Saturday night's game against 
undefeated Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

Cal State San Bernardino, the 
two-time defending CCAA 
champion, is ranked second in 
the ational Association of 
Basketball Coaches Division II 
poll, and is ranked first in the 
West Region. 

"We were positive and upbeat 
[coming into the game)," Lanthier 
said. 

San Bernardino pressed 
UCSD in the backcourt from the 
start. The Coyotes forced three 
Triton turnovers within the first 
three minutes of play. 

While the lead changed 
throughout the first half, the 
scrappy, tenacious and substantial-
ly smaller UCSD squad played 
equally with the Coyotes and 
ended the half down by just two 
points 33-31. 

Unfortunately, the second 
period proved problematic for the 
Tritons. 

"We were able to keep [the

intensity) up for 20 minutes, but 
then we iust lost it," Lanthier said . 
"Our tank was empty and we just 
missed shots." 

The Coyotes came out strong 
after halftime and never looked 
back. They outscored UCSD 41 -
23 in the second half with five 
Coyotes finishing the game scor-
ing in double figures. San 
Bernardino converted all 13 sec-
ond-half free-throw shots and 
held UCSD to just 27 percent 
field-goal shooting. 

James Taylor and 2000-01 

CCAA Player of the Year Bobby 
Burries led the Coyotes with 14 
points each. Glenn Summerall, 
Lanee Ray and Brady Bennett 
each contributed II points, and 
Tellys Knight had eight rebounds 
in the winning effort. 

Christensen led the Tritons 
with 12 points. while sophomore 
Cameron Jackson notched II.

Tritons beat 10th-ranked Broncos 
Swed, Woods lead UCSD with 17 points, Rikansrud breaks nose during Triton victory 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

Back from its four-game road 
trip, the UCSD men's basketball 
team returned to RIMAC Arena 
la t weekend to split two games 
against Cal Poly Pomona and 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association leader Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

The Tritons took on Cal Poly 
POlllona and played their top game 
Friday night at RIMAC Arena. 

UCSD defeated the Broncos, 
who entered the game as the sec-
ond-place team in the CCAA and 
lOth overall in the West Region of 
Division n. 

The Tritons were explosive 
from the start. UCSD forward 
Ryan Swed 1aunched the UCSD 
offensive attack wi th a three-point 
shot within the firs! minute of the 
game. Swed finished with 17 points 
and made five of eight baskets from 
beyond the three-point arc. This 
marks the fourth time Swed has 
made five or more three pointers in 
a game. 

The Tritons capitalized on 
alley-oop passes to Jody Woods, 
who scored 17 points in the game, 
and on fast-break opportunities 
from fresh man guard Hassan 
Bassiri. Triton sophomore C.]. 
Duffant exerted tremendous effort 
scrambling for loose balls and tak-

ing charges. 
Minutes before the first half 

ended, Triton forward Ryan 
Rikansrud took an elbow to the 
face, breaking his broken nose. 
Rikansrud left the game immedi-
ately. He went to the hospital as the 
second half began. 

"Every time you lose someone it 
affects us, but I think we were pret-
ty determined tonight," said 
UCSD head coach Greg Lanthier. 
"We were focused and we were able 
to overcome [the loss of 
RikansrudJ . " 

With seconds to go in the first 
half, Cal Poly Pomona played for 
last possession. The Broncos ran 
out the shot clock and drove the 
lane for a lay-up to bring them 
within twO points of UCSD at half-
time. 

The Broncos played without 
leading scorer Lucas LeCour for 
most of the first half. LeCour 
acquired three fouls within the first 
five minutes of play. 

Cal Poly Pomona scored imme-
diately in the second half to tie the 
game at 36. Offensively, the 
Broncos drove the lane and got 
inside for multiple shot attempts 
from within the key, but failed to 
connect in many point opportuni-
ties. 

Jeff Bonds led the Broncos with 
15 points. Rafael Zielonka added 
nine points and nine rebounds, 

while LeCour also scored nine 
. points. 

Cal Poly Pomona took its only 
lead 54-52 with II :28 to go in the 
game, but UCSD refused to give 
in. The Tritons regrouped, 
regained the lead and never trailed 
again. 

The Triton defensive unit 
improved in the second halfby pre-
venting Bronco offensive rebounds 
and blocking shots. 

UCSD center Jordan Watkins 
contributed 12 points and had a 
team-high seven rebounds. 

"We were very aggressive and 
we had a lot of positive thoughts," 
Lanthier said of his team's effort 
against the Broncos. 

The last minute of the game was 
intense for both teams. Up by six 
off a Swed three-pointer, the 
Tritons accidentally fouled the 
Broncos and gave them tlle oppor-
tunity to get ,vithin four points. 

At 68-64, the Tritons regained 
possession of the ball and Bonds 
fouled UCSD's Nick Christensen 
with 25 seconds left on the clock. 
Christensen sank both free throws. 

Cal Poly Pomona had one last 
chance when they pushed the ball 
down coun and attempted a field 
·goal , but they missed the shot and 
UCSD came down with the 
rebound .

UCSD blows 14-point halftime lead against defending national champions

By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

T he UCSD women's basketball 
team continued its quest for 
respect, taking ational 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II defending national 
champion Cal Poly Pomona to the 
buzzer Friday night and knocking 
off Cal State San Bernardino on 
Saturday night. 

The Tritons entered Friday's 
match with the Broncos 10-2 this 
season and 6-1 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
They were in the midst of a 
three-game losing skid and look-
ing to regain the form that 
earned them the No.9 ranking in 
the Far West Region JUSt twO 
weeks ago . 

UCSD jumped out to a 6-0 
lead. The teams battled to a 16-16 
tie with nine minutes to go in the 
first half before the Tritons ended 
the half on a 23-9 run, making 10 
of 13 field goal attempts. Going 
into the half ahead by 14 against 
the defending national champions, 
UCSD knew it could pull off an 
upset. 

~We went into halftime confi-
dent; maybe a little too confident, n 
said senior point guard Maya Fok. 

UCSD's overconfidence was 
apparent when the Tritons came 
out slow in the second half and 
Pomona went on a run of its own, 
outscoring UCSD 18-4 in the first 
six minutes of the second half,lev-
eling the score at 45. 

Relying on the inside duo of 
Aprile Powell and Salma Rasheed 

to score 28 points, the Broncos 
forged into the lead and were nine 
points up with only seven minutes 
left to play. 

Realizing the game was falling 
away, junior icholle Bromley and 
Fok led the team on yet another 
run - a 16-4 tear in the span of 
three minutes, giving the Tritons a 
three-point edge. 

The Tritons then went cold 
and showed their inexperience in 
big g~mes. While Pomona scored 
five points and attempted seven 
field goals, UCSD missed its two 
field goal opportunities and turned 
the ball over four times in a span 
of three minutes. 

UCSD still had a chance to 
take control of the game when 
BrorrUey grabbed a rebound and 
was fouled by Powell with 21 sec-
onds on the clock and UCSD 
trailing 72-70. Bromley missed her 
ensuing free throws but freshman 
center Margaret Johnson grabbed 
the long rebound. Johnson kicked 
the ball out to an open Fok but her 
three-poi nter just missed and a 
Bronco defender . grabbed the 
rebound. 

With 13 seconds left, Stacy 
Gallagher-Bolton fouled 
Pomona's Anna James, who then 
made both her free throws, 
putting the Broncos up 74-70. 

The Tritons pushed the ball up 
and Ali Ginn made a three-pointer 
with four seconds left pulling the 
Tritons within one. 

With 3.4 seconds left to play, 
BrorrUey fouled James, who again

Tritons lose to 
Cal Baptist in 
straight sets 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's volleyball 
team started off the season in the 
toughest fashion : playing defend-
ing 2001 National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics national 
champion Cal Baptist Lancers in 
Riverside. Even though the odds 
were stacked against them, the 
Tritons played their hearts out, 
but came out a few points short 
when Ca l Baptist swep t the 
Tritons 3-0. 

In the first game, UCSD had a 
20-17 lead that featured strong 
play from junior Eric Perrine and 
sophomore Jim Waller. But Cal 
Baptist came back with four 
straight points on errors by the 
Tritons and a kill by Lancers junior 
Ivan Topehiysky that turned the 
momentum. T he Lancers went on 
to win the first game 30-27, but the 
Tritons proved they would main-
tain their ground all day long. 

"The first game started off real 
well," said head coach Ron 
Larsen, "but I thought if we were 
ahead late, someone would step 
up to be the leader and finish of 
the game, but nobody did that. It

Winterize Your Bicycle! 

Winter conditions make the effort to stay on the bicycle 
much more challenging. The days 
are shorter, the temperatures are 
colder, and the weather is much 
less predictable. Maintaining the 
commitment to commute to school 
or work or to continue exercising 
through the winter months can be made ea ier by taking a 
few simple steps to become more prepared. 

o Be prepared to ride in the dark. Blinking taillights arc 
now a common sight around the local streets after dark. 
They are eas ily een by traflie, and very economical. A lso, 
make sure wheel and pedal renectors are securely in place 
on your bicycle. These are little th ings that rea lly help you 
tand out against the dark background to make you more 

visibl e to the motor drivcn tramc. Re necti ve tape and 
ankle/arm bands are ava ilable a well . 

o Dress appropriately for the condition _ Waterproof plas-
tic jackets are inexpensive and effective. For cold condi-
tions, be sure to layer your clothing. A lightwe ight 
polypropylene or similar base layer wi ll keep you dry on 
the inside. A thernlal fleece sweater covered by a wind-
proof shell , long-fingered gloves, and neoprene toe covers 
will help kcep yo u warm. 

o Properly prepare your bicycle. Keep in mind that a lit-
tle lubrica tion goes a long way. If you haven't put oil on 
your chain, now is the time. Also lubricate the moving pans 
of your bicycle with oil , such as dera illeur pi vots and cable 
housing. brake lever and bushings. Water wi II nush grea c 
out of bearings. Have your hubs overhauled with new 
grease to help keep th e water out and make the wheels run 
smoothly. A set of fenders can help make that ride in the 
rai n or th rough wet early morning streets much more pl eas-
ant by preventing the splash on your front and bac k. 

The UCSO Bike Shop stocks supplie to make your winter 
riding much more enjoyable. From lights to lubricants, 
there i an amazing election of produc s to help meet your 
winter riding needs. The mechanics on s taff can help you 
select from the vast assortment of products and can also 
perform the most intricate of bicycle maintenance tasks, so 
don't let the winter blues slow you down . 

Visit t he Bike Shop, ca ll 534-4279 or v isit 
http: //bikeshop.ucsd.edu for more information on other 
classes a nd events, 

Open Monday - Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Dear Nelly Kno\\itall , 
My grades have plunged between high

--Despairing 

Dear De pairing, 
First of all , it is not uncommon for grades to 
fa ll , 0 don ' t let it discourage you fTOm 
being in school. There arc many on-campus 
places that offer a good atmosphere for

the second floor of Price Center. and the

Housing Office. You can also study out-
doors in the patio of Round Table Pi zza or

Dear- 'l/ell~ h:rumitall' 
A fri end o f mine told me th is wild story tha t 
the design of the Price Center plaza was 
part of a inister admini tration plot to dis-
courage srudent protests. Like the architect 
made the idewalks to the plaza narrow in 
some placcs and zig-zag in others. And the 
plaza is shaped like a prison yard . Is this 
tuff really true? 

--Puzzled Pete 

Dear Pete, 
Yes, and there really is a Santa laus. Let's 
put thi s urban legend to rest. The Price 
Center pl aza was designed to resemble a 
class ic Ital ian piazza by KMD, one of the 
largest architectural firt11 S in San Francisco. 
Ita lian ci ties have narrow streets and side-
wa lks, too. KMD des igned other C 0 
buildings including the Medical Center and 
the School of International Relat ions and 
Pacific lUdies, and the firm designed the 
student center at C Irvine and San 
Francisco Statc.

The c ombination of the Price and 
Student Centers provides a diverse 
range of services, opportunities, and 
environments for our campus. Though 
both facilities are very unique struc -
tures, they work in tandem to provide 
the best options for students. The Price 
Center is considered a "model" student 
union. Campuses across the West that 
are c onsidering building a new stu -
dent union c ome to tour the Price 
Center. The Student Center is unique 
as it's the only center in the country 
with more than one student-run co-op.

the Price Center stairs or become paral Y7cd on a midtcrm,

Aries (0312 1-04/ 19) 
Your butt-headed obse ion 
wi th total control might have 
you ramming heads with your 
sweetie this winter quarter. You 
better take a chi ll pill or, in tead 
lIf burning candle and incense, 
you're going to be burning your-
self out -- alone! Let "mellow" 
bc your mantra this quarter and 
watch the love vibes heat up. 

Taurus (04120-05/20) 
Your bull-headedness will be 
endearing this quartcr -- NOT! 
Compromise, comprise, yc old 
Stubborn One. If thcre's a moral 
to this winter's quarter, it's that 
love ain't no Burger King; you 
can't alway have it your way! If 
you push your weetie to choose 
betwcen your way and the high-
way, you're going to be the one 
who ends up hitchhiking. 

Gem;ni (05/21-06/21) 
OK, listen closely: this winter, 
it 's be time to GET OVER IT! 
Just because omeone's ego has 
left yours a tad bruised, it's 
nothing that can't heal. omeone 
new will be coming along soon. 
Meanwhile, distract your elf with 
all things naughty-but-nice. If 
you're a girl, buy some Victoria 's 
Secret lillgerie. If you're a boy, 
stare at the catalog. 

Cancer (06/22-07/22) 
This quarter will be about turn-
ing some pecial dreams into 
rcality. 0 , you won't be coring 
a date wi th Pamela Anderson or 
Brad Pill, but you will be experi-
encing a "me first" time - a time 
for being pampered alid I<-'ceiving 
affection as oppo ed to non-stop 
servitude and puning others first. 
It's time for you to shine in the 
spotlight instead ofbcing a deer in 
the headlights. 

Leo (07/23-0 /22) 
The theme of this winter quarter 
is "Go follow your drcams". 
You value those you love and 
you're going \0 be pampering 
the heck out of them. Even the 
occasional moment of bickering 
with your honcy can be turned 
to your advantage because it 
will be so much fun to make up. 
By becoming more confident, 
you'll be increasing your sex 
appeal. Roarrrrrr! 

Virgo (08/23-09/22) 
Solitude will simply not be an 
option hi quarter. It ' ll be your 
chance to renew energy and see 
how often you can core! Your 
ocial li fe looks to improvc, as 

do the chan'ce of meeting ome-
one pecial. It looks like all that 
time spent at Ralph's is finally 
going to pay offl Sweats and 
backpacks never looked so exy.

Ubra (09/23-10/23) 
This winter, your natural chari s-
ma and playfulne again come 
to the fore . Ditto for romance. 
After all, how cou ld anyone 
resist your balanced charm? 
This is the perfect time to buy 
your little black book and to 
start filling :! up . Even Hugh 
Hefner wi ll be jealous. 
Scorpio (10/24- 1112 1) 
This quarter will be your door-
way to something very differ-
ent; important changes are in 
the making. Your roommates 
will be amazed at how the but-
terfly you once were ha llImed 
into a dragonfly and everything 
wi ll eem all afl utter. Thcre's 
also a jealousy-factor crawling 
about which cou ld infe t your 
love life. Instead of gelling 
stung, tell it to buzz off. 

SagiHarius (11/22-1212 1) 
Feeling as confident as you will 
thi winter quarter, 2002 will be 
ofT to a brilliant start . Your 
swecti e may not "iew your 
independent streak in the same 
light, however. They may be 
inclined to tighten that leash . 

ompromise when ncces ary. 
but don't make unacceptable 
conce ions. After all , arc you 
walking the dog, or is the dog 
walking you? 

Capricorn (12/22-01 /19) 
This quarter, you'll belicve that 
anything worth doing deserve 
doing well -- and your sweetie 
'vi II certainly appreciate your 
attention to detail. By remem-
bering all the important dates 
and by gelli ng creative with 
your wooing, you'll be getting 
straight-A' in the ubjeet of 
love. But neglect your partner, 
and you better be prepared to 
attend summer school. 

Aquarius (01120-02 /18) 
mitten with the unusual and 

bored by the ordin ary, your 
choice of partner can somctimes 
put you through real challenges. 
This quarter, fo r example, you 
wi ll fall in lovc with the psychic 
equivalent of siame e twin. It 
might seem like double the trou-
ble, but you' ll be lucky to be 
getting thi two-for-one deal. 

Pisces (02/ 19-03/20) 
Congratu lat ion! Your self-
esteem eems keen to fire up 
tbis quarter. This will add to 
your allure and you have admir-
ers up to your gills. 0 take 
advantage of thi s time to 
explore the many fish out in the 
sea. Miss thjs opportunity, and 
all you could end up with is a 
piece of dried up sushi .
