UCs urged to 
curb on-campus 
credit card sales 
By RAY HENGST 
Contributing Writer 

Credit card companies may soon 
have to deal with new policies that 
regulate their conduct on campus. 

On Sept. 12 Governor and ex-
officio UC Regent Gray Davis 
signed a bill into law requiring 
California State Universities and 
California community colleges to 
adopt policies to regulate the mar-
keting practices used on campuses 
by credit card companies. 

The bill does not require the 
UC system to comply, but it does 
include language strongly urging it 
to do so. 

The regulatory policies are to 
include a prohibition on credit card 
companies offering gifts to students 
in exchange for filling out credit 
card applications. The bill , which 
was introduced by California 
Assemblyman Paul Koren. D-Los 
Angeles, also I equires the affected 
campuses to offer debt education as 
a regular part of campus orienta-
tion for new students. 

Koretz's Chief of Staff Scott 
Svonki n said the main goal of the 
legislation is to empower and edu-
cate college students on the risks of 
using credit cards.

"Eduuting consumers is an 
effective way to make companies 
change their tactics."

By TJ. TALLIE 
Contributing Writer 

Concerned students from 
the California Public Interest 
Research Group held a demon-
stration at a local Staples Office 
Superstore last Saturday to 
inform th!! public of what they 
call the company's environmen-
tally unfriendly policies. 

CalPrRG members orga-
nized the demonstration to call 
on Staples to stop using wood 
from old-growth forests in its 
office-supply products and to 
alert consumers of what the 
organization deems the com-
pany's destructive practices. 

Old-growth forests provide 
habitat for endangered and 
threatened species, and the 
destruction of such forests is 
worrisome to some environ-
mentalists because old-growth 
forests take centuries to form, 
but can be decimated relatively 
quickly by wood chippers. 

"We're here to educate as 
many people as we can," said 
Matt McKeeley, a Revelle 
senior and the chapter chair at 
CaIPIRG. "Educating con-
sumers is an effective way to 
make companies change their 
tactics." 

Staples spokesman Tom 
Nutile said that Staples is in 
the process of developing a 
policy to promote sustainable 
regrowth programs by giving 
preferenc(. to wood certi Ii cd to 
be from such sources. 

"We believe this certifica-
tion process is one of the best 
ways to eliminate or minimize 
the possibility of any old-

growth fibers in Staples prod-
ucts," he said. 

CalPIRG Campus Director 
Emily Deckman said that 
Staples still uses old-growth 
wood products that arc unnec-
essary with the widespread 
availability of other, more eco-
friendly sources. 

" It's a si mple step that 
[Staples] can take to switch 
from using old-growth forest 
wood to wood frolll new -
growth forests ," Deckman 
said. 

Nutile said that Staples is a 
leader 111 environmentall y 
friendly practices, and that the 
company sells more than 300 
different recycled paper prod-
ucts in each store, and 1,000 . 
compan}"vide. 

utile also said that Staples 
encourages consumers to buy 
paper brands that use recycled 
post-consumer fibers . He said 
Staples recently introduced a 
50 percent post-consumcr 
waste recycled paper, twO dif-
ferent papers with 30 percent 
and a Staples brand paper with 
10 percent recycled fibers . 

" In the vast majority of 
cases, recycled paper costs 
more than nonrecycled paper, 
and it's harder to get the con-
sumer to pay more," he said. 

CalPfRG teamcd up for the 
event with Ecopledge, an envi-
ronmentall y conscious group 
that works to change the poli-
cies of companies it considers 
eeo-unfriendly. Ecopledge 
claims several successes in the 
past, including influencing Ford

Awareness: 
Lectures aim to dispel 
misconceptions of faith 
Continued from page 1 

Salem said the MSA hopes "to bring 
Islam to people, to get involved in the 
communiry and to serve the Muslim 
students at UCSD." 

He also said he wants to promote 
understanding through education and 
exposure. 

"People have no idea what Islam 
is," he saId. "As Muslim-Americans, 
it's our dury to educate people about 
Islam. We're bringing knowledge to 
them," said Salem of the MSAS o'rga-
nizational philosophy. 

The events planned for this week 
are only part of the way the MSA 
hopes to combat what it sees as mis-
representation of Islam. . 

"The expressed purpose of this 
event is to educate the campus on 
Islam - it is noncontroversial and 
purely educational," said Ann Brady, 
Student Organization & Leadership 
Opportunities adviser to religious 
organizations. 

10 that end, the MSA has sched-
uled several speakers to lecture in the 
evenings for the first three days of the 
week. Monday'S lecture, ") ihad vs. 
Terrorism," will be held in Center 
Hall Rm. 11 5 at 7 p.m. The speakers 
for all the lectures are Muslim schol-
ars or noted members of the Islamic 
communiry. 

"The Concept of All ah" is the topic 
of Tuesday'S lecture, which is to take 
place at Center Hall Rm. 119 at 7 p.m. 

"If someone can only go to one 
thing, I recommend this lecture," 
Salem said. "This is very important 
for people in understanding Islam." 

Prior to this, at noon on Tuesday 
the MSA is sponsoring a lecture and 
performance in the Price Center. It 
hopes to get)urassic Five, the members 
of which are Muslim, as well as some 
other bands to perform after a speech 
given by a prominent Muslim. 

Rounding out the evening lecture 
series is ''The Unknown Legacy of 
Islam in America." This lecture will 
address the heritage of Islamic faith in 
the United States from African slaves 
to Malcolm X and Mohammed Ali. 

Salem said the Muslim faith factors 
prominently into the religious heritage 
of many African-Americans. 

Scheduled for Friday is an open 
"jummah." This prayer service will be 
held in Price Center Ballroom A at 
12:45 p.m. 

The MSA leadership has great 
hopes for this event - particularly 
that it will bring a lot of non-Muslims 
into contact with Islamic teachings 
and lifesryles. 

"We expect people will have a 
great time at the fair and at the con-
cert. Hopefully many non-Muslims 
will come find out more about Islam," 
Salem said .

L~gislation combats giving

Continued from page 1 

"[Credit card companies] focus on 
giveaways and distract students from 
the real issues. Many college students 
got credit cards just because they 
wanted free gifts," Svonkin said, cit-
ing a Public Interest Resource Groups 
study. 

Gov. Davis spokesman Roger 
Salazer sa id that students inexperi-
enced with using credit cards can get 
into more debt than they realize. 

"Because of the lax requirements 
that come with student credit cards, 
[snldents are] often put in a position 
where they've run up more debt than 
tlley can handle," he sa id .

Connection between sleep and memory retention broken 

Students may now have to reconsider opting for 
more sleep over more cramming. 

The long-held belief that more sleep is conducive 
to memory intake has been disputed in a new study 
published by neuroscientist Jerome Siegel of UCLA 

By researching past experiments and in conduct-
ing hiS own, Seigel concluded that humans and ani-
mals who were deprived of rapid ete movement 
sleep did not show signs of reduced memory for-
mation or retention. 

In the article, he cites both human and animal 
examples where this holds true. 

For animals he notes the duck-billed platypus as 
an example of an animal with excessive REM sleep 
but little cognition abilities. 

In humans, Seigel notes that people with brain 
conditions that eliminate REM sleep have nonnal 
memory pattems. 

Although lack of sleep is not essential to learning 
and cognition, it is proven to hinder one's concen-
tration in a leaming situation. 

Seigel's research will appear in the Nov. 2 issue 
of Science. 

UCSD's first chancellor honored 
in weekend symposium 

Herbert York was honored by UCSD on Nov. 3 in 
a symposium that celebrated his lifetime contribu-
tions to the world of physics, higher education and 
arms control. 

The events were organized by the UC Institute on 
Global Conflict and Cooperation and hosted by the 
UCSD Graduate School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies. 

The symposium covered three lectures: "Building 
National Defense: From the Manhattan Project to 
National Missile Defense," "The Evolution of Arms 
Co~trol" and "The Changing Role of the University in 
Society." 

Prior to becoming chancellor, York worked on 
the Manhattan Project, was the first director of 
Lawrence ~ivermore. National . Laboratory and 
served as sCience adViser to PreSident Eisenhower 
and ~resident Carter, where he specialized in arms 
control policy, 

York is currently the director emeritus of the 
IGCe. 

UCSD l'artners with VA hospitals 
to minimize medical errors 

In the hopes of improving patient care and safe-
ty, UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego 
Healthcare System have teamed up to form the new 
San Diego Center Center for Patient Safety. 

The SDCPS will work to reduce the volume and 
severity of medical errors by having UCSD Medical 
School professors conduct research within the San 
Diego healthcare community. 

Matthew Weinger, professor of anesthesiology at 
the UCSD School of Medicine, will serve as director 
of the SDCPS. 

The SDCPS received a $590,000 grant from the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to run 
the rroject, which will draw on the participation of 
loca physicians, professors, scientists, patients and 
community groups. 

SDCPS will focus on the role of communication 
between patients and doctors through various stages 
of patient care because many medical problems are 
attributed to communication problems. 

Among other things, res~archers will investigate 
events leading up to the direct causes of medical 
errors. 

The center will develop patient safety laborato-
ries for training and research, and a Web site will be 
developed to further the educational process, 

The grant was awarded for the next three years. 

TA union opposes legislation 
that restricts student visas 

The United Auto Workers union Local 2865, which 
represents academic student em~ throughout 
the UC system, announced its opposition to state and 
federal legislation aimed at restricting visa opportuni-
ties and increased monitoring of international students. 
. Such legislation was proposed as a response to 
the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in which some of the 
terrorists were in the United States on intemational 
student visas. 

The UAW is against the legislation because it said 
it sca~oats international students for the attacks 
and it said the legislation is discriminatory.

Apathy stems from varied roots 
Seminar offers a chance to reflect on students' apolitical tendencies 

By EMILY VlllO 
Contributing Writer 

\Ve aren't hungry and we're 
nOI homeless. As college stu-
dents, we don 't have money to 
contribute, and we are not com-
pelling in our youth. As a group, 
we barely vote. In fact, regarding 
government, we are mostly 
si lent. 

It seems we matter very little 
politically in the United States. 
It seems we have few concerns 
that make our involvement cru-
cia l, and few attractions that 
draw the politicians near. We 
have isolated ourselves from 
ac tive democracy. 

I was struck in a small way on 
Oct. 29, when several UCSD 
professors gathered to give a 
seminar on the implications of 
the Sept. II terrorist attacks. 
After the presentation, a student 
roved the audience with a 
microphone for those wishing to 
direct questions to the profes-
sors. 

This segment was monopo-

lized by individuals who were 
clearly not students. In fact, most 
were white-haired, such as the 
gentleman next to me who 
napped through much of the 
seminar but awoke in time to 
pose a lengthy, convoluted ques-
tion to the panel. 

Another woman, so intent on 
not relinquishing the micro-
phone once she secured it, did 
not bother to ask a question. 
Steadily ignoring the efforts of 
the student timekeeper to 
wrench the microphone from her 
grasp, she blabbed on about any 
old thing until someone, some-
how, made her stop. 

Where were we, the students? 
To he fair, perhaps two students 
managed to ask questions just 
before the session ended. But this 
was so unusual that, when one 
professor noticed the student 
raising his hand, he muttered a 
comment that was perhaps not 
accidentally picked up by the 
microphone: "Finally, a student 
with a question," or something to 
tha t effect. 

And to be fair, one student's 
question was so thoughtful and 
well-posed that the professors 
merely blinked for a few counts. 
Their initial and inadequate 
response was "Good question." 

But it is no exaggeration to 
say that student participation at 
the seminar was mostly limited to 
the cheerful student timekeeper. 

In fact, it's possible that non-
students were able to monopolize 
the question-and-answer period 
because the student timekeeper 
gave them unfair preference with 
the microphone. 

If that was the case, then stu-
dents should remember that this 
university belongs to us and not 
to intellectually preening com-
munity members. Students 
should certainly have been given 
priority at the seminar. These 
are, after all, our professors. But 
perhaps this was not the case. 

The second possibility for our 
lack of participation is that the 
students in attendance were sim-
ply too dumb to formulate ques-
tions. 

Pal Leunclcua""'" 
This is ridiculous. For one 

thing, we are students. It is our 
job to look, listen, think and ask. 

But at that, the atmosphere in 
the auditorium was a bit stuffy 
and pedantic for my taste. A sem-
inar is an exchange of ideas and 
nor a trampoline for showily exe-
cuted verbal acrobatics. Must 
audience-generated questions at 
a fairly informal seminar be 
impressive in order to be asked 
and answered? 

We are, after all, neither 
political commentators nor 
coifed news broadcastet's - only 
students. And I do not think the 
professors were crafty, polished 
politicians to be tripped and 
tricked and needled with elabo-

• rate, multiclaused questions. 
The third possible cause of our 

collective muteness Monday night 
is the most frightening and the 

: most complex: Perhaps we could-
n't be bothered to ask questions, 
since others seemed to be doing it 
for us. And perhaps we didn't care.

H~man~ cause ecological harm to Earth 
EnVIronmentalIsts hurt more than help in their quest to save terrestrial life 
By LOGAN GOH 
Contributing Writer 

We live in a time when the 
individual has true power: The 
voice of even one person can be 
enough to change the world. It 
seems this power is intoxicating. 
Nowadays, it is not uncommon to 
sec people campaigning for this or 
that cause. 

One such group, environmen-
talists, has corne to prominence in 
recent decades. These "environ-
mentalists" work under the belief 
that humans are ruining the deli-
ca te balance of nature that allow 
life to flourish on Earth. We are 
con uming our resources too fast 
and polluting too much. It is their 
belief that only by cutting back on 

industry and technological devel-
opment, only by returning to 
nature, will we be able to survive 
the damage that we have done. 
One of their favorite slogans is 
"Save the Earth." 

This simply does not apply. We 
are no more capable of destroying 
our planet than an ant is capable of 
pulling down a mountain. 

Life is not a fragile thing that 
needs protection. Even in the sun-
less ocean depths, the sulfurous 
ash of volcanoes, and the frigid ice 
of the poles, it survives, and indeed 
flourishe . We can nuke every inch 
of the Earth, and still, life will sur-
vive. One day, maybe a billion 
years from that point, life will 
once more walk the Earth. 

But it will not be us. We may 

he unable to destroy the Earth, but 
we are now quite capable of 
destroying ourselves. The Earth is 
in no need of saving, but we 3fe. 
Perhaps the environmentalists 
should change their war cry to 
"Save the humans." It is more 
accurate, and certainly more likely 
to grab attention. 

I am sure few will disagree with 
me when I say that keeping the 
human species alive is a good 
thing. Unfortunately, most envi-
ronmentalists are n<?t merely 
intent on preserving human life 
when they speak of saving the 
planet. They have a specific means 
of accomplishing this, and there 
are few alternatives acceptable to 
them. 

What they seek is to bring 

Earth closer to the time before 
human civilization spread across 
the globe, when forests covered 
the land and all wrieties of species 
roamed the planet. 

Quite often, actions toward 
that end do not promote human 
welfare. For example, despite the 
fact that nuclear power does not 
pump pollutants into the air, the 
environmentalist movement has 
opposed it at every turn. The oft-
cited reason for opposing nuclear 
power is the questionable safety of 
the power plants, yet even without 
mounds of scientific evidence 
proving otherwise, statistical 
information alone shows nuclear 
plants are far safer than, say, dri-

O ne doesn't actually have to 
go looking hard for that 
true ~asnington, D.C. 
experience. 

JUSt living in the city makes it 
seep into your pores, and before 
you know it, it takes a hold of your 
very soul. 

I know this is true beca use it 
happened to me. I arrived in the 
District of Columbia in late 
August, gung-ho to see everything, 
to do all the tourist things. 

I was under the delusion that 
seeing everything there is to see 
would make it a perfect experience. 

Yet I discovered that the true 
D.C. experience is not necessarily 
in visiting every single tourist 
attraction, but in experiencing the 
everyday wonders hidden behind 
the more glamorous points of 
interest. 

Taking time to walk tile city, 
ride the metro, go to cafes and bars, 
experience the tastes of every coun-
try through the multitude of cul-
turally diverse restaurants - these 
are just some of the things that 
must be undertaken just as vigor-
ously by anyone visiting the famous 
tourist attractions. 

But for me, nothing in the 
District of Columbia compares to 
walking through the Capitol build-
ing. 

Every day, I feast my eyes on it 
twice during my commute. I get 
the daytime look and then the 
evening look for tree_ 

Viewing the Capitol on a daily 
basis has had a strange effect on 
me. I've fallen head over heels in 
love with the utter beauty and mag-
nificence it radiates. 

1 cannot stop myself from taking 
picture after picture of the Capitol, 
trom every imaginable angle and at 
all times of the day, just to see the 
lighting change on the building. 

There is really no way to excuse 
my photograph-taking sprees. I 
have so many duplicates that it far 
exceeds logical reasoning. You 
could call me a parent who can't 
stop cooing and taking endless pic-
tures of her brand-new baby. 

It's just that the newness and 
excitement derived from seeing the 
Capitol haven't worn away with 
time, as many might expect them to 
have. 

Today, just one look at the 
Capitol still sends a shock of 
amazement and wonder through 
me. 

Seeing it is a wake-up call : J am 
here in Washington, D.C. I am a 

. part of and connected to something 
larger. 

The things I'd only read or seen 
in the history books are now irre-
versibly a part of my life. The 
Capitol, Washington Monument, 
the Supreme Court and the White 
House are just some otthe histori-
cal places that are now a part of my 
daily existence. 

This is what I love about living 
in D .C.: Here, history is not dead 
and found only in dusty old books, 
but remains alive forever in the 
stone and marble buildings. 

Here, one feels at the center of 
the universe. It is where everything 
seems possible, which is what I find 
so completely intoxicating about 
life in this city. 

And as I si t here on the steps of 
the Capitol at 7 p.m., I remain

Flag symbolism is complex 
Reason for patriotic outbursts is deeper than appearance 
By $IMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

In the last few issues of the 
GUIlT'ditm, I have noticed a debate 
on the display of flags following the 
terrorist attacks of Sept. II. It start-
ed with a column by Bertrand Fan, 
in which he looked at the new trend 
as, essentially, a condemnable form 
of posing. It continued with a reply 
from Jessica Long on Oct. 15, in 
which she saw ti)e habit as a mani-
festation of pride in this "great 
country" (a very stereotypical 
expression these days). 

I believe that things are more 
cemplex than the two writers 
describe. Posturing, dumb confor-
mitY, cheap sentimentalism and 
similar motives may explain some of 
the flags out there, but not all of 
them. I have seen flags, at least, dis-
played by people whose aversion to 
the previous motives is proven 
beyond any doubt. 

There is no doubt that many 
AmeFicans believe they live in a 
great country, but to reduce the 

-ffi3ssive display of national flags to 
this sentiment would be an over-
simplification. 

French people, for instance, 
have a very strong national sense 
and believe they live in a great 
country. Yet this belief never result-
ed in a massive exhibition of French 
flags on cars or apartment windows, 
a practice that would provoke puz-
zlement and hilarity on the streets 
of Paris. 

The different attitude toward 
these acts of what we might call 
"symbolic patriotism" - in the 
sense of expressing patriotism 
through the use of symbols -
reveals a difference between the 
American. national sentiment and 

that of other countries in the world. 
I believe this is due to the different 
circumstances in which people 
became citizens of these countries. 

For a French person - or 
English, or German and so on -
the &ct of being born French does 
not entail choice, whether personal 
or ancestral. France, in a sense, just 
hllpptntd to the French people. 

Americans are different. With 
the exception of Native Americans, 
who were already here, and African-
Americans, who were brought here 
by force, the decision of being 
American was consciously and pur-
posely made by some member of 
the &mily not too long ago (let us 
say, for most people, in the last 150 
years). 

The ancestral memory of this 
decision is still very much alive: 
Most Americans can tell you trom 
which country their family came. In 
an oblique way, such a statement 
also highlights the decision the fam-
ily made, at one time, to become 
Americans. 

At the time, this choice was cast 
in symbols because people coming 
trom various countries in the world, 
leaving behind in many cases 
extreme poverty, needed something 
to identify themselves with their 
new country. Symbols like the flag 
served a powerful function in this 
sense, and I do not think I am com-
pletely wrong if I see in this circum-
stance the origin of the curious 
American fascination with symbols. 

Symbols are so important that 
when reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance, one does not promise to 
be faithful to the president, 
Congress or the government, but 
only to the flag of the United 
States. The pledge of allegiance is 
essentially saying: "My family made 

a good choice by deciding to 
become American, and I am going 
to stick with it." 

The peculiar American national 
sentiment is also responsible for 
certain expressions, such as, "I am 
proud to be an American. " 

On one hand, this expression is 
typically American: I would assume 
that most Italians, Danes or 
Spaniards are just as happy to be 
Italians, Danes or Spaniards as 
Americans are to be Americans. 
But, by and large, those other 
groups do not feel any compelling 
need to let anybody know that they 
are. 

On the other hand, the sentence 
itself is rather peculiar: Why should 
one be proud to be an American? 
Apart trom the fact that pride is one 
of the seven deadly sins and, there-
fore, that a good person should not 
be proud of anything, anybody who 
was born in this country did not 
really do anything to be an 
American. So, what is there to be 
proud of? 

The answer, I think, is again to 
be traced to this "ancestral choice." 
One can be proud to be an 
American if one chose to be one and 
wants to reiterate that he .made the 
right choice. It is this choice, made 
in the past but very present in the 
American national consciousness, 
that forms the sentimental under-
pinning of the expression, "proud to 
be an American." 

This should also imply that the 
basic requirement for being a good 
American is to want to be one - a 
statement quite incompatible with 
the national feelings about immi-
gration, but that is a subject for a 
different article.

ving. There are over 100 nuclear 
power plants in the ·United 
States, the youngest being over 
20 years old. Yet in the 40 years 
since nuclear power became 
available, there has been one acci-
dent in the United States, and it 
was not even serious enough to 
cause loss of life. 

Similarly, political opposition 
shut down the space program, 
which could have once moved 
heavy industry off Earth. Today, 
space shuttle technology is over 30 
years old and hideously expensive, 
yet the government is unable to 
gain the support to develop more 
efficient means of propulsion. 

Environmentalists even object 
to genetically engineered crops, 
despite their pOtential to feed 
millions of starving people and to 
put to rest worries of worldwide 
famine (another popular environ-
mentalist bogeyman). The rea-
son: fears that genetically modi-
fied plants might replace natural 
varieties. 

Most environmentalists 
believe in species preservation, 
and in protecting any and all 
species from extihction. While I 
personally agree with this ideal, I 
do not agree with the motivation 
behind it. There seems to be an 
underlying assumption that 
humans are the sole cause of 
extinctions, whereas species have 
been dying out billions of years 
before humans ever came along. 
In fact, we were not even around 
for the massive extinctions that 
have occurred periodically in 
Earth's past. 

I do not accept the concept of 
nature's balance. I do not accept 
the implic.it belief that nature 

OPINION 5 

nourishes life, that if we could 
just demolish all the works of 
man, the world would become a 
garden paradise. 

Perhaps this air of benevo-
lence is not too surprising consid-
ering most of us only see nature 
through beachside vacations and 
idyllic camping trips, the sites of 
which have long been tamed by 
human hands. We have forgotten 
rotting teeth , verminous hair, the 
terror of being hunted by beasts 
and the taste of rancid meat. 
Nature plays no favorites. 

From geologic records we 
know that there is no such thing 
as a natural equilibrium. Over the 
millennia, the average global 
temperatu re has gone up and 
down numerous times, long 
before we came along with our 
cars, factories and farting cows. 

There is nothing to stop an 
asteroid trom crashing into the 
earth and killing us as it possibly 
did to the dinosaurs. It does not 
even take a killer asteroid to 
extinguish us - the fossil record 
shows a number of mass extinc-
tions, and most of them were 
caused by nothing more spectac-
ular than natural climate change. 
Species become extinct all the 
time, but we do not have any rea-
son why we might be excluded 
trom this rule . 

We do not know of any such 
reason beca use there is none. If 
we are to avoid the fate of the 
dodo bird, then we must create 
that reason ourselves. 

The only tool we have to work 
with is science. If we return to the 
trees, then we will be like other 
species, etching out a brief exis-
tence before becoming just 
another fossil memory. 

But if we move forward , if we 
do not shackle ourselves with 
rootless doubts, if we do not blow 
ourselves up or eat up our entire 
food supply, we will become 
something more.

Many possible causes

Consider this : In "Citizen 
Politics," author and UC Irvine 
professor Russell Dalton 
describes a discrepancy between 
the average voter turnout of peo-
ple in their 50s (about 80 per-
cent) and of people in their 20s 
(about 60 percent.) And that is of 
the people who bothered to vote. 

Dalton offers evidence that 
describes voter turnout in the 
1990s as 69 percent for France, 
77 percent for Germany, 78 per-
cent for Great Britain and 53 
percent for the United States. 

Some weeks ago, the Ntw Yo,.k

who lives in the American

and the war that has followed it.

most of these displays were naive, 
some of them were quite tacky, and 
some in outright bad taste -
when, for instance, flags were past-
ed over car windows, creating a 
tra ffic hazard (remember, kids: 
Don't flag and drive). 

I read these gestures, however, 
as a further symbolic confirmation 
of the decision to become 
American. Although I would not 
use such a blunt symbolic instru-
ment in order to express my con-
demnation of terrorism, I accepted 
it as a natural renovation of peo-
ple's decision in the face of a diffi-
cult time for the United States. 

Things changed completely 
once American planes started 
bombing Mghanistan. I see no jus-
tification whatsoever for display-

state. So far, he wrote, the war 
was something that was happen-

. ing to someone else. 
Perhaps, for college students, 

politics is something that hap-
pens to someone else. 

Here, there will be some who 
toss this aside in disgust. What 
about our peace coalition, pro-
America rally, affirmative action 
parade, student government? 
. These efforts represent only a 
minority of the student popula-
tion at UCSD. Were we all rep-
resented, there would not be one 
peace coalition but one dozen, 
not one affirmative action parade 
but a daily parade for 100 differ-
ent interests. 

The massive dearth of signifi-
cant student participation in pol-
itics means that either we are not 
interested in politics, we do not 
believe our participation will 
affect politics, or we do not 
believe that our personal political 
participation is ' important in a 
functioning democracy. 

Well , perhaps we are not 
interested 111 politics. Perhaps 
neither party enchants us . 
Perhaps, at this age, we lack the 

ing a flag as a celebration of the 
fact that one's country is killing 
people. And, in order to avoid 
confusion, I would like to make a 
distinction between believing that 
the attack was necessary and cele-
brating it. 

Many people think the attack 
was necessary, and some people 
think the unavoidable civilian casu-
alties are a tough but justified price 
to pay. Some believed that the 
attack could go on without civilian 
casualties: These people live on a 
different pl.anet than you and I, and 
we do not need to worry about 
them. 

By and large, I disagree with 
these opinions, but I can under-
stand the reasons behind their sup-
port. 

social or financial responsibility 
that makes politics seem impor-
tant to others. Or maybe "the fact 
that some half-anonymous ass or 
another has been elected presi-
dent of the United States" is as 
meaningless to us as it was to 
Henry Louis Mencken, whose 
book "A Blind Spot" was pub-
lished in 1920. 

It could be that we don't relate 
to the bills and political posses, 
and to faraway problems like 
hunger, when there are fresh 
bagels at Sierra Summit when we 
want them. Maybe democracy is 
something we' ll do when we 
grow up and have more time. 

Maybe we don't believe our 
participation will affect politics. 
Perhaps we have never signed a 
referendum that made it to the 
ballot, and it could be that the 
real world seems miles away from 
our tidy enclave at UCSD. 

Maybe we do not believe that 
pqJitical participation is impor-
tant. It seems that democracy 
functions well enough without 
us. 

And when we attend Monday 
night semin.ars, the questions 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2001 

Displaying a flag in the last 
weeks, however, is different. It 
means celebrating the arrack, and 
celebrating the fact that Mghani 
people are dying. No military 
attack, however necessary one 
thinks it may be, and however jus-
tified one may consider it, should 
be celebrated . Celebrating the 
death of people we do not know 
and understand is not different 
fro·\. be celebrations in some Arab 
COWltries after Sept. II that we all 
condemned - and rightfully so. 

We must not fall in the trap of 
celebrating the death of human 
beings. We should not transform a 
national flag from a symbol of one's 
choice and of national unity to a 
blindfold that will make us accept 
everything done in its name. 

seem to get asked without our 
having to raise a hand. 

Last Monday'S student silence 
is not to be dismissed as an inci-
dental curiosity. If we are unable 
to participate in this most basic of 
democratic activities - political 
discussion and exchanges of ideas 
- then it follows that we will not 
participate in more demanding 
political activities. 

Last Monday, I watched as 
students allowed their elders to 
steal their right to a political 
voice. I wonder what was not 
asked and what was not answered 
as a result of this theft; perhaps 
nothing important. Members of 
the community asked good, even 
excellent, questions. But they 
were asked at our expense. 

Maybe we will, in fact, learn 
how to be democratic when we 
are all grown up and have time. 
Meanwhil e, we are consumers of 
a cheap democracy we help to 
create with our silence. 

Politics may feel like some-
thing that happens to omeone 
else, but without our participa-
tion, it is something worse. It is 
something done to us.

Colleges up spending on amenities, student adivities 
Modern college students live in much more luxury than their ~ounterparts of yesteryear 

I lANOVER, .I I. - Massage 
sessions, on-campus beach volley-
ball courts and free cable television 
are perks that many of taday's col-
lege students receive automatically 
upon matriculation. 

These modern-day amenities 
appea r downright luxurious when 

. compared to the more austere 
book-focused collegiate experience 
of the past. 

Funding for these and similar 
expenditures has soared among U.S. 
universities in recent years because 
administrators seek to anain a bal-
ance between their academic and 
social objectives. 

Across the nation, colleges and 
uni,versities are building multimil-
lion-dollar residence halls that 
include both living and study spaces, 
such as Dartmouth College's 
McCulloch Hall, to ease the transi-
tion to an environment and lifestyle 
very different from living at home 
and mending high school. 

College 
costs are 
on the rise 
Study: Public 
college tuitions 
highest since '93 

CHARLOTTESVIT..LE, Va.-
Public colleges have raised tuition 
this year to the highest rate since 
1993, according to a survey released 
by the College Board last week. 

Tuition went up an average of 
7.7 percent at four-year public 
institutions nationally - nearly 
triple the rate of inflation. 

Much of the national increases 
were because of the recent eco-
nomic downturn, which has made 
it difficult for states to support 
their public institutions. 

This has not been the case in 
Virginia, however. Tuition this 
year at the University of Virginia 
only increased 1.8 percent for in-
state sttldents and 4.9 percent for 
out-of-state smdents. 

Statewide, the average tuition 
increase at four-year public insti-
tutions rose only 2.4 percent for 
in-state students and 4.5 percent 
for out-of-state students. 

Virginia, however, has not been 
immune to current economic con-
cerns. 

Because the tuition freeze poli-
cy is ~n appropriation and is not in 
code, it is up for review every leg-
islative session. 

"It's going to be a tight budget 
year," said G. Paul Nardo, State 
Council of Higher Education for 
Virginia communications and gov-
ernmental relations director. 

He said he thought that the 
economic siruation and the Sept. 
II attacks were going to create a 
"tough budget environment" 
when the tuition freeze legislation 
is up for consideration in 2002 . 

The College Board survey also 
showed loans made up 58 percent 
of student aid this year, as com-
pared with 41 percent in 1980. 

However, at the university, 
grants actually increased as a per-
centage of need-based aid, 
Financial Aid Director Yvonne 
Hubbard said. 

- Sara Jeanblanc 
ClIVtllitr Dtli/y 

"Daronouth is definitely increas-
ing expenditures for student activi -
ties and services," according to 
College Treasurer Win Johnso11. 

Johnson said increases in per-
student spending this year include a 
boosted budget for safety and secu-
rity, greater allocations for the pro-
gramming board, longer hours for 
the Collis Student Center and the 
added cost of the new kosherlhalal 
dining facility. 

He said on average, the college 
has allocated 53 million in addition-
al funds per year to pay for improve-
ments like these in student services. 

The college places such high pri-
ority on enhancements, such as pro-
viding new residence halls and non-
academic, student-controlled spaces 
because the community has routine-
ly voiced concern to the administra-
tion , saying that existing facilities 
are not up to par. 

"Both academic and student life 
expendirures are being considered 

[equally)," Johnson said. "The stu-
dent experience is nor JUSt [either] 
academics or services." 

He added that student services 
"make the lives and experiences of 
students who are and \vill be here 
bener." 

Although the nation's slumping 
economy has led to a decline in the 
college's endowment, Johnson 
remained optimistic about the 
future of spending on students, 
explaining that the economic down-
turn "hasn't caused us to cut back." 

But he added, " It 's making 
accomplishing the range of things 
we want to do a more challenging 
prospect ... everything's contingent 
upon funding." 

In response to Dartmouth's 
increased efforts to promote student 
services, Spanish language professor 
Elizabeth Chamberlain said, "I 
think it's a great idea. There needs 
to be a balance of spending between 
academics and social options." 

Chamberlain also expressed con-
cern about the current housing 
crunch. 

"Ir 's absolutely funda!flcntal to 
look into new housing options," she 
said. 

Bea u Roysden stressed the 
importance of Dartmouth 's com-
mitment to undergraduate experi-
ence as a chief interest. 

"I think that the first priority 
should be having professors teach all 
classes," he said, reAecting the opin-
ion that academic pursuits should be 
funded before social options. 

Roysden, a member of COSO, 
also commented on the funds 
perennially left untouched by cam-
pus groups. 

"Student organizations should 
make an effort to get all the funds 
that are available," he said. "We 
should get really good pop events, 
and interesting speakers and perfor-
mances." 

The definitipn of "student ser-

vices" varies from college to college, 
hindering efforts to compare how 
different schools arc alloc:lling 
funds 10 meet the needs of lheir 
undergraduates. 

But in rankings publ ished by 
U.S. News and World Report , 
Darrmouth ranked lllh under 
"financial resources" for 2002 . 

To help keep track of 
Dartmouth's finance, the college 
recently purchased a cost-a nalysis 
system that separates undergradu-
ate expenses from those of gradu-
ate students. This will allow Jna-
Iysts to calculate more accurately 
the full cost o f a Dartmouth edu-
cation. 

Johnson predicted that this sys-
tem would be implemented in the 
near future, in part to aid an ongo-
ing study conducted by the National 
Cost Council on Higher Education.

blazing new paths 
Provost Gabriele Wienhausen will 
lead UCSD's Sixth College in its 
mission to bridge the gaps among 
culture, art and tec.hnology 

lyon Ut:w/Guar60n 
Future preparation: PrOllost Gabriele Wienhausen has been preparing for fall 2002, when UCSD's newest college 
will welcome its first freshman class. 

1fOII~ 
New Iddition : The sixth college administration building is now open and in the midst of preparing for 1he new 
college's grand opening next year. 

"Change will be one of our 
O'ademarks.n Provost Gabriele 
Wienhausen proudly speaks of 
the mantra for Sixth College, 
which will open as UCSO 's 
newest college in fall 2002 . 
Focusing on culture, art and 
technology. Sixth College is one 
that will surely bring about an 
entirely new view of the universi-
ty experience. 

"We will not be ca tegorizing 
our students by when they grad-
uate. but instead. by when they 
arrive," Wienhausen said. 

The buildings may not have 
permanent addresses yet, but 
the founding principles of the 
school surpass all norma l barri -
ers. The coll ege will emphasize 
the correlation between civi l 
service, community and expres-
sion. 

Said Wienhausen. "You are a 
product of your culture. and cul -
ture cannot truly reveal itself 
without art and technology." 

Wienhausen is enthusiastic 
about the challenge placed 
before her. 

"Twenty yea rs ago. if you had 
asked me if I would be provost. I 
would have said ·no ... • said 
Wienhausen. "That's serendipity 
for you. You either make some-
thing out of an opportunity that 
you never expected. or you move 
on to something else. Later you 
realize that by saying 'yes,' you 
agreed to something incredibly 
difficult, but because your heart 
was in it, you could do it." 

Excitement for Sixth College 
has preceded its appearance as 
many students on campus have 
heard news pertaining to its 
opening. 

"The new college is just 
going to add to the diversity 
already on campus," said Simone 
Hilliard, a freshman at 
Roosevelt. "It's great to have new 
experiences and it will most like-
ly add hands-on experience for 
the second- and third year stu-
dents who have gotten tired of 
day-to-day activities. People may 
Mnt to transfer into the school 
because of the fact that it was 
something that they were inter-
ested in, but never found until 
now," 

The UCSO community's 
openness to innovative ideas was 
one of the reasons that 
Wienhausen decided to stay after 
being a professor of undergradu-
ate biology. 

MGoing into the biology 
department and seeing how to 
manage a large group while giv-
ing each individual personal 
attention was a skill that I picked 
up," Wienhausen said. MIt isn't 
easy and you cannot do anything 
without • team. You ~ave to be 
ready for feedback, and being a 

good listener is part of that." 
Coming from the 

Westfalische Wilhelms-
Universitat in Munster, 
Germany, Wienhausen rea li zed 
the many differences betwecn a 
university in Europe and a uni -
versity in the United States: 

"The confusion \vith the lan-
guage. as peopl e he re speak 
'American' rather than 'English,' 
the lifestyle was different ," 
Wienhausen recalls. "ThiS wa~ 
one of my IllOSt influential expe-
riences as I was COlllltlg to a new 
country and was 3t11dzcd at the 
friendly and open people \I hu 
chang~d my \'ICW~ of pcr'oollJi 
interaction." 

\Vicnhallsen went on to 
become the co-pri nci p.l1 inve,lt -
gator of the IIowJrd I lughes 
Undergraduate Sctence 
Enrichment Progral11 Jnd co-
director of the doctoral progratll 
in mathematics and science edu-
cation. 

Enthusiasm fro 111 
vVienhause n's words scem~ to 
have penetrated many HutletltS' 
views of the new college and 
provost. 

"Professor \ Vienhausen 's 
enerf,'Y and passion for the sixth 
college shows you how grea t the 
college is go ing to be. If she is 
this exci ted ahollt it, the college 
is going to be great," Il illiard 
said. 

Community outreach and 
forming a connection between 
the class and the world outside 
the classroom are both aspects 
on which the college will focus . 
Issues ranging from race to per-
sonal privacy are matters that arc 
deemed important by 
Wienhausen. 

Yet with all the various ele-
ments that will be brought 
together in the Sixth College. 
there is one common goal that 
the administration keeps in 
mind. The goal would be 
attained once a student is able to 
grow academically, intellectually 
and socially. 

"A person has many faces," 
Wienhausen said. "You cannot 
separate a persoll into thei r acad-
emic life and their social life. In 
between. there is a gray area 
where things overlap. No one 
thing can determine a person's 
success and for this reason. as a 
whole, we want to make sure that 
student and academic affairs 
work closely together. n 

Sixth ColJege plans on having 
direct connections between fac-
ulty and students, as well as 
between students and the com-
munities in which they live. 

Wienhausen has gone into

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 

Editor draws parallel between two very 
distinct yet comparable generations 
By GEOFF DIETRITCH 
Associate News Editor 

Right now, And)1 Stojkovich is 
in a coma. Earlier today he wa 
dead. That is quite an improvement 

b~' any medical standards. 
Thll1gs tend to change pretty 

quickly when you aren't paying 
attenrion. 

After writing that last sentence, 
my phone rang, and it was my 
mother. "Shit," I munered, know-
ing who was calling and why. There 
is never good news at this hour. 

ow it seems Andy, or "Pop," as 
we all knew him, is in fact dead at 
the age of 84 due to old age. 

Is i l time to cry and stress over 
the loss of a loved one, a figure 
whom I so admired' No. It is sad-
ness I feel, but tears are for later, 
for his life was, fo r the most parr, a 
good one, and ne that rings all tOO 
fal11J il ar. 

Fur the 21 )'ears I knew him, he 
II/WIIYS brought a smile to my face. 
\ \'hcther it was some srupid magic 
trick. or ditching school and sneak-
Ing our way into the VIP tent at 
Pebble !.leach by saying I was John 
EI\\'a)", kid and he was Elway's dad, 
Pop always knew how to brighten 
Ill\' dar. 

. Tt{cre always had to be a 
St.lI1ford connection, usually some 
big lie like he was Chief)ustice 
Rhenque't~ roommate, or that he 
h.Hl t.lclcled Jackie Robinson on the 
football fie ld. Of Robinson, Pop 
would say he was "the best damn 
rnan" he ever faced 111 his life, but a 
I11rnllte later he would find some 

-
-

flaw with African-Americans -
though always political, never the 
KKK-style racism we all despise. 

But, with all his intricacies, 
making people unexpectedly smile 
was certainly his specialty. I 
remember the time when he first 
saw my family after my brother 
died, and he didn't know how to 
express himself. He calmly asked, 
"So what's new?" 

He is no longer with us down 
here, but most everybody who knew 
him feels pretty confident that he is 
in a better place looking down on us. 

Maybe he is catching up with his 
wife, who left him over 10 years 
ago. Maybe he is standing in a long 
line with firemen, police officers, 
paramedics, postal workers, flight 
attendants, pilots, soldiers, fre-
quent fl yers and businessmen, who 
all left their loved ones much more 
tragically nearly two months ago. 

It is nice to know there is a little 
bit of Pop in every one of us at 
UCSD, and his is the trail that 
many of us will follow. 

Like many srudents at UCSD, 
Pop was a first-generation 
American. He was born a long time 
ago to an immigrant family in San 
fransico. His fami ly was from 
Yugoslavia - or Serbia, as he never 
let us forger. 

After attending Balboa Il igh 
School in San fransico in the 
1930s, he went to Stanford 
University; not because he was so 
smart, which he may very well have 
been, but because of his skills on 
the gridiron. 

Pop played defensive end for the 

Stanford Indians, as they were 
ca lled back then, well before politi -
cal correctness swept this country. 
"Politically correct" is one thing he 
sure as hell was not, but more all 
that soon. 

At Stanford, besides playing foot-
ball, he had various on-campus jobs, 
just as I and many of my peers have, 
to make ends meet. He was a campus 
mailman and was involved in srudent 
government. Just as we do, he had to 
balance fun, work and public service. 
I cannot help but think that my 
experiences, a combination of surf-
ing, landscaping, pool maintenance 
and news writing, are in some way 
similar to what he did so many years 
ago on the farm. 

When he left college and entered 
the "real world," the world was 
turned upside down, not unlike it is 
today. Across the Atlantic Ocean, an 
evil regime was building on the 
deaths of those who were different 
from them and as a result, they 
threatened to wreak havoc upon the 
free World. Evenrual ly, airplanes 
would shower that hatred upon 
America on a December morning in 
a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Ths sounds chillingly familiar. It 
was not long w1til Pop joined the 
Navy and served as an aviator on a 
bomber. 

Right now, I am left wondering 
if I, along with my peers, will 
respond the same way: by defend-
ing our country, which is being 
attacked by similarly heinous sol-
diers. T hat is yet to be seen, but the 
mood on campus does not seem to 
be as resolved as I imagine it was in 

the streets back in his day. 
Our cause is the same but is our 

motive and resolve? For his gener-
ation was one that responded to the 
utmost adversity of the Depression 
and World War II because it had 
to. Do we feel as if we must act 
immediately and decisively? 

We have so much that is similar 
to our grandparents' generation, 
and just as they fought for the sur-
vival of liberty and life, now we 
must do the same. 

I cannot help but think that we 
are immune to acrual adversity, that 
we as college srudents will pass the 
buck where it would have stopped 
over 60 years ago. 

However, for as much as Pop 
and I seem to be the same, we are 
so different. 

As a 21-year-old on a college 
campus, I am awash in political cor-
rectness and liberal thought, and 
this was, in fact, the mai n differ-
ence between me and Pop. 

Dinnertime conversation was 
always entertaining, as my dad 
would slowly attack Pop's stub-
born Republican ideals. Some 
families do not encourage conver-
sation abou t religion or polilics. 
But I pity these families, as they 
have missed out on n ights full of 
humor and subtle anger that 
forced our family to accept and 
love one another for who we are, 
and not a masquerade of who we 
want each other to be. 

lt is his feelings toward those 
not in our family that clearly sepa-
rate the modes of thought of our 
two very different generations. 

Words like "nigger" and "jap," 
which are terms that never even 
enter my head, could roll off his 
tOngue so smoothly that my 
cousins and I would look at each 
other in amazement, realizing that 
our world is so very different from 
his. 

After working in the upper ech-
elons of Del Monte, an American 
transnational produce company in 
Mexico City, from the late '60s to 
the late '70s, he would have known 
some Latinos or at least relate to 
them, I assumed. But I think the 
only ones he ever talked to were the 
ones who mowed his lawn. 

My best friend, on t1ie other 
hand, is a Mexican-American, whom 
Pop and his conservative chums 
would pass off as merely an "illega l." 
But the two of them in a room 
together would always crack jokes or 
talk football and always in Spanish. 

It is this dichotomy which per-
plexes me. Pop and his generation 
fought the good fight and had some 
dirty baggage along with it. Will we 
do the same? 

As I venture out into the real 
world, I wonder how my genera-
tion \vill respond to challenges sim-
ilar to the ones that he and his gen-
eration sta red down with 
vengeance, and consequently won. 

What starred as a lener to 111)' 
ailing grandfather has sadly 
turned into an obiruary, but hope-
fully his story, as incomplete as I 
have just told it, will make some of 
us Stop and think. ot only about 
the challenges ahead of us, but of 
our loved ones as wel l.

Provost: 
New college will stress 
practical experience 
continued from page 9 

vor about the new connections that 
the student body will make once it 
comes into action. 

Her eagerness to make her stu-
dents blossom into well -rounded 
people stems from her past influ -
ences. 

"When I first came to UCS D, I 
me t incredibl e people," said 
Wienhausen. " People that soon 
became role models and mentors. I 
see being provost as my way of 
helping out and mentoring others, 
in order for them to reach thei r 
potentials and see their possibili -
ties. When you share what you 
know, that is how you grow .as an 
individual and how we grow as a 
community. Without mentors, no 
one would get very far, and we will 
try and create an envi ronment in 
which our students wi ll achieve 
their personal definiti ons o f suc-
cess. " 

Sixth College has its t heme 
placed in expression and th inki ng 
outside of the box. But a big secret 
still remains untold. At UCS D, a 
college first receives a number and 
then later is given a name that is 

nor~ally one of a historical figure. 
As o f now, Wienhausen has some 
ideas, but the topic is still open to 
discussion. 

"They should name it D aVinci 
Co llege," s:l id Revelle freshman 
Bryce Warwick. "It seems to li t 
since the relationship between cul-
ture , art and technology is so inter-, 
esting. \-\le would create the next 
wave of Da Vincis." 

Sixth College plans on bcmg a 
campus open to new ideas. Ta ki ng 
students outside of the college set-
ti ng and making the educauonal 
experience more practica l is a hope 
of \Neinhausen 's . 

"Art can develop a communi ty, 
and I have seen that an art center 
can also be a communal center," 
she sa id. "Attempting to he.lp stu-
dents figure out who they are and 
what they want to do from their 
hearts are things that 1 ho pe wi ll 
cOr.le out of our college." 

T he birth of Sixth College 
seems to be one of positive p ropor-
tions, but Wienhausen has had to 
deal with her share of ctiticism. 

"Things some ~ay say can be 
harsh," Wienhausen said. "But you 
learn to deal with it and be willing 
to listen to all of it." 

While we still must wait until . 
fall 2002 to see this new center of 
knowledge and self-realization 
open, one can still learn more 
about the opportunities that will 
soon become available. 

Wienhausen is attending a lun-
cheon for Women in Science and 
Engineering on Friday, Nov. 9

Wienhausen 's backgTound ,

charisma as a leader is unprece-
dented . 

Sixth College is about to come 
to our campus, so be prepared. The

change is most certainly right 
around the corner.

Essay,writing Web sites 
raise questions of legitimacy 
With over 50,000 essays available 
online, students sign on to get ideas 
By EAGLE HARTMANS-OGAWA 
Contributing Writer 

Internet sites such as The Evil 
House of Cheat, School Sucks, 
Phuck School and ACI offer sru-
dents several kinds of assistance in 
writing essays. 

Some srudents at UCSD use 
these services. Onc srudent admits 
to using essay databases for human-
ities courses. 

"I read the books we were 
assigned and then I read the essays 
online. I cut and pasted the ideas 
that looked good and then re-
worded them and wrote the rest," 
he said. 

Erin Kocku and Aaron Herzl, 
both senior communications 
majors, believe it is unfortunate 
that students do not produce their 
own work but do not believe the 
university can adequately combat 
cheating. 

"There are just too many peo-
ple to catch everyone," Kocku says. 

Yet, some srudents are not both-
ered by the fact that many of their 
peers use these sites. Deann Allbee, 
a junior biology student, comments 
that, "In the long run, developing 
your own ideas gives you an advan-
tage and people who do not lose 
out." 

The ACI Writing Assistance 
Center is a high-end essay-writing 
company run by Danial K. 
Berman, Ph.D. , 

have become Teacher Mediocrity 
Societies." In the Internet age, the 
site argues, the focus of education 
should be on developing analytical 
skills, not memorization. 

The Evil House of Cheat, at 
chtatbollse.Clml, offers free member-
ship to its archive of 1,600-plus 
essays. But, you have to send them 
one of your own original essays to 
become a member. To get access to 
their entire collection of over 9,500 
essays, you have to pay $14.95 . 
Members can view the level the 
paper was written for, (college or 
high school), and also the grade the 
author received for the essay. 

When asked how the company 
can rationalize providing srudents 
with essays knowing they may be 
used dishonestly, an employee from 
Essay Depot teplied that using 
their essays is, "Like going to any 
library and looking at a book.". I Ie 
and the company urge that the e 
essays should be used as a reference 
for ideas exclusively. He defended 
their position by saying, "We are 
very up-front. If a professor asks for 
cooperation, we cooperate. Our 
essays are not kept a secret. We 
routinely send copies of first pages 
to universities." 

Most sites explicitly warn that 
when srudents hand in purchased 
essays to receive academic credit, 
they are acting illegally and in an 
academically dishonest manner. 

The Cheaters 

'There are just too 
many people to 

catch everyone: 

who has taught 
extensively at the 
college level. His 
company offers 
services ranging 
from editing 
papers to writing 
c\lstom papers for 
c ustom ers. 

-Erin Kocku 
RooSf'l.,t 5.n/or 

Paradise Web site 
suggests that sru-
dents who view 
their essays can 
just cut and paste if 
they want. But, 
their disclaimer 
points our that all 

Custom papers are 
written by the company's staff 
according to specific instructions 
given by the student. 

Customers first enter the level 
of work they are doing: undergrad-
uate, master's or doctoral. ACI thcn 
asks the srudent if he has a good 
grasp of the English language, so 
the paper matches his articulation 
level. Then it asks for a detailed 
description of the paper ACI will 
write, including the kind of cita-
tions needed. Most papers take at 
least two weeks to complete. 
. Daniel supervises the writing of 

every custom paper, which costs 
$40 per page with a minimum pur-
chase of $500. ACI's custom papers 
are not intended to fu lfill academic 
requirements - they are meant to 
help srudents by gathering research 
materials. 

School Sucks has an entirely 
different system. Its motto is 
"download your workload ." In 
order to enter the site, you have to 
click on a button that reads, "I 
hereby agree that school sucks." It 
has essays on its free database but 
also links to paptrcampus.com for a 
larger selection of papers that are 
for sale. 

School Sucks has a section of its 
site dedicated to addressing the 
questions of educators, focusing 
more on secondary education. It 
advocates that, "Teacher Unions 

their advice is a 
- joke and should 

not be taken seriously. 
Jackie Giordano, the academic 

coordinator for Eleanor Roosevelt 
College's Making of the Modern 
World writing program, said, "It's 
becoming increasingly easy [to pla-
giarize] because students no longer 
go to the library to copy ideas, thcy 
can just stay in their rooms." 

Last year, MMW professors 
began using a new program aimed 
at stopping plagiarism. They 
require all snldents to submit t11cir 
essays electronically to WWW.tII7·-
7Iitin.Clml. Tumitin.com is a compa-
ny lo!=ated in Oakland, Calif. that 
uses a "plagiarism prevention sys-
tem." The system cross-checks 
essays against each other and those 
submitted in past years for similar 
content. 

Turnitin.com also keeps a data-
base of phrases and ideas that are 
already published on the Web. If 
any papers contain plagiarized 
work either directly or in para -
phrased form, the system detects 
the material and notifies the staff. 

MMW has already seen results 
from using Turnitin.com. Spring 
quarter of last year they found that 
several students had submitted 
essays with sections either taken 
from the Web or from books that 
had been citecLon the Web. The 
students were punished according 
to UCSD's academic policies.

Because: 
Nothing out there is 
quite liKe sports fanatics 
Continued from pace 20 
sports and go from there. Ask him 
to tell you about his favorite team 
instead of trying to pass yourself 
off as a true fan. This will give the 
guy a chance to show off and 
showcase his expertise on his 
favorite sports tea m, and it will 
put you in his graces for showing 
an interest in something that he is 
so passionate about. 

The last kind of impostor is the 
casual sports enthusiast. While I 
don't understand these people, they 
are the ones that I have the least 
amount of beef with. 

These are the people who 
don't really follow particular 
teams, but will watch sporting 
events if they are on television. 
Occasionally, these types of peo-
ple will attend events with friends 
and enjoy the atmosphere. While 
I personally don't see how a per-
son could hold back and not get 
completely engrossed in the 
sports fanatic world of fo! owing a 
favorite team, I can only ~J/, "to 
each his own." Casual sports 
enthusiasts do not claim to have a 
vast knowledge of sports or a par-
ticular team, so they are OK in my 
book. 

Now that I have described the 
others, let me get down to the nuts 
and bolts of what it actually takes to 
be a true sports fanatic. 

You have probably seen these

know about the present year's 
team, but also know about the 
team's history. True sports fanatics 
have followed the same team for a 
number of years. They have been 
through the bad times as well as 
the good. 

Personally, my teams are the 
Lakers (basketball), Padres (base-
ball), Chargers (football) and Bills 
(football) . T hese are the teams 
that I have followed religiously 
for the past 10 or 12 years. I know 
that under the present circum-
stances, I might seem like a fair-
weather fan by rooting for the 
Lakers. Let me just say that I can 
name the Lakers' entire 12-man 
roster, the three guys they have 
on the injured reserve, and the 
names Sedale Threatt, Anthony 
Peeler and Cedric Ceballos are 

still fresh in my m1l1J . I ca n also 
name the starting lineup and a 
few reserves from the Showtime 
days of Magic and " Big Game" 
J ames Worthy. 

For those of you who have read 
this column and found yourselves 
in one of the first two categories, J 
urge you to pick a team and stick 
with it. Get to know the players and 
the team. I think that you will find 
that it will increase your enjoyment 
of watching sports. For those of 
you who are casual sports enthusi-
asts, there's nothing wrong with 
that. 

However, I also urge you to 
convert to sports fanaticism. It 's 
really a blast. Finally, for all .of you 
sports fanatics out there: Keep up 
the good work. 

Because I said so.

Cuder, a senior from 
Corona, Calif., is 
arguably the reason the

nation's top teams. Her 
defensive presence has 
allowed only eight goals

"Julia is great," 
Lautenschleger added. 
"We don't get discour-

Julia is back there. 
Having someone who 
can clear the ball like 
Julia is awesome; she will

because 

he world is full 
of fair-weather 

fans, fake fans and 
casual sports enthu-
siasts. . 

There is another breed of peo-
ple OUl there who are in shon sup-
ply. They are the ones who pro-
vide the life blood of the sports 
world . 

They arc the few, the proud -
the 'pons fa natic. 

I, n:ysclf, am proudLO ~ay that I 
;llll J ~port~ fanatic. I havc a select 
few tealll~ that I follow religiously 
throughout the ),e,lr. I bleed their 
team colors. I fecI the joy of victory 
;l nd the agony of defeat along with 
the Ilughry warriors for whom I 
root so blindly. I curse at them for 
stupid personnel mOl'es and praise 
thelll when they land a big-name 
free .lgent. 

Ilonestly, I don 't thi nk that my 
hfe would be complete without 
the,e teams. 

There are many people out 
there who claim to be uue sports 
fan.mc , but fall miserably short 
when put to the test. The ones that 
Infuriate me the most are the fai r-
weather fa ns. T hese are the fans 
who root for whichever team IS 
oOll1g well. 

All example would be the mass-
es who Jumped on the Chicago 
Bulls bandwagon once the team 
started winning championships in 
the 1990s. T hese fans are easily 
identifi ed by thei r inabi lity to 
name more than rhree players on 
the ream's rosrer other than the 
stars. 

A true sports fanatic would be 
able to name at least three pla)'ers 
off the bench In addition to the 
starters and head coach. [ used to 
hve In Northern California, and the 
thing that bugged me to no end was 
the masses of 4ger fans in the area 
who didn't know anything about 
the team. They would simply wear 
the team's apparel and bask in the 
glory of its victories, but were 11(Jl 
true fans at all. 

Aside from identifying Steve 
Young and Jerry Rice, the vast 
ma joriry couldn't even name 
another player on the team . 
Personally, [ think that being a 
fair-weathe r fan should constitute 
a felony offense, punishable by 
five yea rs in jail and having to root 
for the Los Angeles Clippers bas-
ketball team . 

Another kind of fan that really 
gets to me is the fake fan . These 
arc the schmucks that say that 
they like a team just to fit in with 
a crowd. The fake fan is distin-
guishable from the fair-weather 
fan in that the team that the fake 
fan claims to root for does not 
have to be on top. 

The most common type of fake 
fans are women who want to 
impress guys by acting interested 
in sports. This is their first mis-
take. They will only look more 
foolish once the guy starts asking 
them about the team and the girl 
has no clue what he is talking 
about. Ladies, JUSt admit to the 
guy that you know nothing about

Tritons down Davis in 1 st round 
Women's soccer advances to CCAA championship game against Cal Poly 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

With nearly \ ,000 people in 
anendance, the UCSD women's 
soccer team defeated UC Davis 5-
I to earn a spot in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Women's Soccer Championship 
game against Cal Poly Pomona. 

A strong second half by the 
Tritons capped off an impressive 
victory. Senior forward Erika 
Alfredson scored three goals and 
assisted on another one to lead the 
Tritons. [[er first goal occurred at 
the 35th minute when she got hold 
of a loose ball on a corner kick and 
drilled it pa t Davis goalkeeper 
Christine Ogden. ' Ine next score 
came from UC Davis' Kara 
[[ayllar, who found the right post 
in the 38th minute for the Aggie 
goal. It was all Tri tons from then 
on. 

"[t was a great win," sa id Triton 
freshman goalkeeper J aimc 
Lautenschlegcr. "The first half, we 
weren't completely connecting, 
but at halftime we just told each 
other to relax and play our game. 
\Ve knew chances were going to 
come, and in the second half they 
did." 

Elizabeth [[ughes started off 
the second-half onslaught with a 
goal on an assist by Megan 
Mend07-3 at the 50th minute to 
give the Tritons a 2-1 advantage. 
[n a span of nine minute, the 

UCSD team knocked off three 
more goals to secure the victory. 

Kristin Jones added a goal in 
tbe 63 rd minute on a double-
assist from Alfredson and Julia 
Cuder. Alredson scored off 
another corner kick by Cuder in 
the 64th minute to increase the 
margin to 4- \. The barrage 
ended with Alfredson scoring her 
third goal of the night in the 71st 
minute off a feed from Mendoza. 

"It was an unbelievable win," 
said Triton sophomore goalie 
Kami Poma. "W~came alive in the 
second half and totally connected 
on the field." 

Next up for the UCSD 
women's soccer team is the CCAA 
Championship finals against Cal 
Poly Pomona. The last two meet-
ings between these teams turned 
out to be classics, the first being a 
victory for UCSD at Pomona in 
an overtime game and the last 
being a win at Triton occer 
Stadium for Pomona in another 
overtime thriller. 

With the stakes a bit higher in 
this next confrontation, the 
UCSD women's soccer team real -
izes that a victory here will secure 
the Tritons a spot in the Regionals 
and possibly home-field advan-
tage. 

"We know that we will proba-
bly face Pomona again in the 
Regionals," Poma said, "but a win 
Sunday will help our chances in 
Regionals. Without looking too

Ciimme: Senior Erika Alfredson battles a UC Davis defender for the ball last 
Friday at Triton Soccer Stadium. 

. far ahead, we are taking it a game 
at a time and concentrating on 
them in the championships." 

When asked if the coaching 
staff or players are worried about 
any of the star players on 
Pomona's squad, such as Lisa 
Hermen, Poma said, "They should 
be looking out for our players. I 

feel we have the better team to get 
us to Regionals." 

Judging from the game on 
Friday, it is hard to disagree. 

To add to the high standards set 
by the UCSD women 's soccer 
team, Cuder has been named the

[n a huge weekend for UCSD women 's 
volleyball, the Tritons came up big with an 
exciting upset of No. I-ranked Cal State San 
Bernardino followed by an easy victory over 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

On Friday night in front of an official 
attendance of 395 in RIMAC Arena, the 
Tritons, ranked fourth in the Pacific Region, 
roared out of the gates with an overpower-
ing 30-19 win in their first set. UCSD was 
led in the first set by senior Kathleen Hentz, 
who posted seven kills to give the Tritons a 
1-0 advantage. . 

"She's been our steadiest player," said 
head coach Duncan McFarland. "She gives 
up a lot in height but makes up for it 111 
effort." 

However, the Coyotes, riding a 12-match 
winning streak, were not about to let the 
Tritons get away without a fight. They took 
the next two sets 30-21 and 30-20 to take a 
2-1 set lead. 

But the Tritons battled back and came 
out on top of a hard-fought fourth set, 30-
27 . In the fifth and deciding set, UCSD was 
once again led by Hentz, who notched four 
kills, including the game-ending kill, to give 
the Tritons a \5 - 10 set win and a 3-2 overall 
victory. 

Hentz finished with 15 kills on the night, 
and freshm~n Stacy Dunsmore and Katie 
Hogan each contributed II kills and \ 0 kills, 
respectively, 

"Stacy Dunsmore's five aces was just 
gigantic," McFarland said. "She had a 
tremendous match as well." 

McFarland noted that the third set was the 
turning point of the match for the Tritons. 

"[n the third game, we were really get-
ting blown out by [San Bernardino]." he 
said. "But when [ subbed in Jennie Wilson 
she gave us a spark and got the team going 
again. Even though we lost the set 30-20, 
she helped give us momentum for the fourth 
game." 

The loss was only Cal State San 
Bernardino's second this season; they 
dropped to 17-2 on the season and 25-2 
overall. 

"It was a pretty great win for our guys," 
McFarland said. "A great, great upset." 

The following night, UCSD readily dis-
posed Cal Poly Pomona with a three-set, 
30-18,30-18,30-20 victory. 

Dunsmore again was integral to the 
Triton victory, contributing a match-high 13 
kills and making only two errors to end with 
an amazing .440 hitting percentage. 
Sophomore Denelle Smalley had a team-
high 10 digs for the Tritons and fresh;"!lan 
Teresa Ohta posted 23 assists. On the night, 
UCSD outhit Cal Poly .266 to .074. 

"I think it was a case of one team havins 
a lot more motivation than the other," 
McFarland said. "Our team has certainly 
improved - they're starting to believe in 
themselves. I'm real proud of [them]." 

The victory was the -'fri tons , seventh 
home conference win in a row and helped 
UCSD improve to 14-4 in league and 19-6 
overall.
