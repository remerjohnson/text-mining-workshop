Berkeley 
Chancellor 
Will Step 
Down 

BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert 
Birgeneau announced Tuesday that he 
will step down from his post at the end 
of 2012. Birgeneau, who has served as 
chancellor since 2004, wrote an email 
to Cal faculty, staff and students on 

March 13 say-
ing that he was 
grateful for his 
seven-year ten-
ure, and proud 
of the accom-
plishments and 
honors he pre-
sided over.

“I am deeply 
grateful to have 
been entrusted 
with the pro-
found responsi-

bility of leading this great institution 
and its outstanding faculty, staff and 
students through one of the most chal-
lenging periods in its 144-year history,” 
Birgeneau wrote.

Birgeneau noted that since he 
became chancellor, UC Berkeley has 
seen higher graduation rates and has 
enrolled more international and out-

Mock Trial 
Qualifies for 
Nationals for 
First Time

BY ANGELA CHEN
Editor in Chief

UCSD Mock Trial has qualified for 
national competition for the first time 
in school history.

After placing in the top 8 in the 
San Diego regional competition held 
in February, the UCSD teams were 
two of 24 to advance to the Irvine 
open regional championship, or ORC. 
To qualify for nationals, teams must 
be ranked in the top six of the 24 com-
peting at the Irvine ORC, which is the 
only one on the West Coast.

“The Irvine ORC is considered 
to be one of the toughest, if not 
the toughest, in the country,” mock 
trial co-president Ayelet Bitton said. 
“UCLA — the reigning national 
champion —  is there, USC, a top 15 
team, is there, UC Irvine, a top 15 
team, is there. The gods have to be 
going in your favor to get out of the 
Irvine ORC.”

The teams have competed in Irvine 
for the past two years, but left without 
a qualifying bid each time. This year, 
they came in second to UCLA and are 
headed to Minnesota in April.

“The students spend hundreds of 
hours practicing and pay thousands 
of dollars out of their own pockets 
every year to compete in tournaments 
across the country, all without receiv-
ing any school credit,” volunteer coach 
David Lichtenstein wrote in an email. 
“I could not be more proud.”

The team is currently fundrais-
ing the $3500 necessary for the team 
to compete at nationals, which will 
be held April 13 to 15 at Hamline 
University in Saint Paul. A.S. Council 
voted at its March 14 meeting to loan 
$4050 to the group, interest-free. The 
team has until June 30 to pay off the 
loan.

“We put in hundreds of hours  
practicing each week— I feel like I’m 
a full-time mock trial competitor, and 
do school and work on the side, so 
we really need the support,” Bitton 
said. “That said, this victory is well-
deserved. We’ll go to nationals and 
we’ll do well.”

team at mocktrial.ucsd.edu.

CRISIS 
AVERTED

The Ché Café will keep its doors open after successfully raising $12,000 to pay for its 2012 insurance costs. According to Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary Ratcliff, the venue was in danger of being shut down if its members could not pay the annual insur-ance premium, which was due this spring. 
In response to these financial problems, the Ché Café Collective, which consists of volunteers 

and core members responsible for booking shows, organized two benefit blogs to fundraise for the 
insurance costs. The members also organized the “Ché Café Benefit Concert — I Promise” festival, 
which took place Jan. 6 to Jan. 8 and hosted 24 bands over the three days. 

Core collective member Rene Vera said that the organization has always struggled to pay insur-
ance costs, but the $12,000 should be enough to cover insurance for another year. 

“The big show that pulled us through was the benefit show in early January,” Vera said. “Up until 
that point, we were only halfway through our goal.”

Vera said that half the money came from benefit shows, and the other half from direct donations 
obtained through the blog. According to the Ché Café benefit blog co-founder Jesse Kranzler, the 

Che Cafe Collective raises enough money through benefit concert, direct 
donations to keep music venue open.

VISUAL DIARY By Khanh Nguyen

BY AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

Scripps is celebrating — again. A year and a 
half ago, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
won a national competition to operate a new 
research ship. The ship, funded by the Office 
of Naval Research, is called the AGOR 28. And 
last Tuesday, Feb. 28, the Navy announced that 
it has selected the shipyard at which AGOR 28 
would be built: Dakota Creek in Washington, 
D.C. Operational in 2015, the ship will be the 
fifth research vessel in the Scripps’ fleet, which 
is the largest of its kind in the country. Because 
the Scripps ships are used by scientists from 

many different specialties, each vessel is highly 
customizable. Before expeditions, the ships are 
frequently modified to fit the purpose of the 
mission.  

Few shipyards have the means to build ves-
sels as complex as the AGOR, and orders can 
be backlogged for years at a time. Between 
three and five years of planning, designing 
and engineering go into the construction of 
a research vessel, SIO Associate Director Dr. 
Bruce Applegate said.  

"It's much more complex than a grain ship or 
a RORO," he said, referring to the massive cargo 
ships used to transport cars, trucks and trains.

Research vessels are also expensive. The 
Navy is fully funding the construction of 
AGOR; they have provided $88 million up front, 
and will make additional payments as needed 
as construction progresses. AGOR 24, better 
known at Scripps as the R/V Roger Revelle, cost 
$60 million when it was constructed in 1993. 
Applegate estimates it would have cost well over 
$250 million to build today.

Dakota Creek Industries is designing the 
AGOR 28, along with the research equipment in 
it, largely from scratch. AGOR’s original design 
is a main factor contributing to the expense. 
The high cost of original design is the status quo 

for ships like AGOR; for example, GPS was used 
in research vessels for decades before it became 
cheap enough for civilians to use. In unfamiliar 
waters, it was a necessity. 

"All you've got out there is blue all around 
you," Applegate said. "There are no signposts 
in the sea."   

AGOR 28 will be fitted with advanced com-
puter networks and data distribution systems, 
so that virtually any data collection hardware 
can be fitted to the ship's mainframe. This 
means that researchers from a variety of disci-
plines can modify AGOR to suit their purposes. 

"Whatever it is, you just plug it in, and 
you're up and running," Applegate said. "What 
sets us apart from other institutions is that we 
don't aim for one kind of science. We do it all: 
geological, biological, chemical, climate change 
— you name it, and our ships are capable of 
handling it."

UCSD students interested in conduct-
ing research with the Scripps fleet can write 
research proposals through the UC Shipfunds 
program. Because the fleet is large and adapt-
able, Applegate said, UCSD students can con-
duct specialized research offshore.

group raised approximately $9,000 in 
donations through the blog.

“There were so many people reach-
ing out to us from across the country 
and other countries: people who had 
been to a show in the past and wanted 
to see it stay open,” Vera said. “I think 
it really showed that people do care 
about the Ché.”

Collective member Greg Prout said 
that the Café’s financial problems start-
ed with a brief insurance lapse a couple 
of years ago. 

“The person who was supposed to 
pick up the mail just stopped picking 
it up, so we stopped getting the bills,” 
Prout said in an Sept. 19 article in the 
San Diego Union Tribune.

The group’s financial problems 
increased when a 2010 burglary set the 
Café back $5,000 after stolen equip-
ment had to be replaced. 

The Ché is one of five UCSD co-
ops. Sarah Latoski, a recent graduate 

who was a member of the collective 
for over three years, told the Union 
Tribune that the venue opened in 1966 
as a coffee hut and received its cur-
rent name, Ché Café, in 1980 when it 
became a student-run organization. 

“It was a vegetarian cafe,” Latoski 
said. “It also was a safe space for radical 
politics to be practiced.”

Notable acts that have played the 
venue over the years include Bright 
Eyes, Billy Corgan, Animal Collective, 
Jimmy Eat World and Green Day.

The Che is continuing to book 
musical acts, and will host five bands 
on March 25. 

Groups scheduled to perform 
include local act “Griever,” “Gagakirise” 
from Japan and “Bitches” from the 
U.K.

Life Gary Ratcliff could not be reached

of-state students.
“Our undergraduate student body 

continues to be among the very best 
in California and each year we have 
attracted more applicants,” he wrote. 
“Our graduation rates have risen to 
over 90 percent.”

Birgeneau was the chancellor of the 
University of Toronto from 2000 until 
he moved to Berkeley in 2004. He said 
that he intends to return to teaching at 
Cal after he steps down.

“I am planning to return to the 
departments of physics and materials 
science and engineering as a regular 
faculty member and hope that I have at 
least one more truly significant phys-
ics/materials science experiment still 
to come in my academic career,” he 

wrote.
UC President Mark G. Yudof com-

mended the chancellor for his work in 
a statement released by the UC Office 
of the President on March 13.

“In his more than seven years 
as Chancellor at the University of 
California, Berkeley, Robert Birgeneau 
has proven to be a passionate, dedicat-
ed and effective steward of the world’s 
greatest public university,” Yudof stat-
ed.

Birgeneau presided over a tumultu-
ous time for UC Berkeley. Tuition at 
UC schools rose 32 percent in 2009, 
another 8 percent in 2010 and again by 
11 percent in 2011. In 2011, U.S. News 
and World Report ranked Cal second 
for room and board costs and 10th for 
out-of-state cost of attendance.

Birgeneau again came under fire 

in November 2011 when police used 
batons and bean bag guns to subdue 
Occupy Cal protesters in Sproul Plaza. 
Students said that Birgeneau was not 
supportive of activists, and publicly 
condemned his actions.

With Birgeneau’s announcement, 
UC Berkeley joins UCSD in a search 
for a new chancellor. UCSD Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox announced last sum-
mer that she intends to step down at 
the end of the 2011-12 academic year. 
Fox has also been chancellor at UCSD 
since 2004. 

The La Jolla Light reported on 
March 8 that UCSD will begin inter-
viewing candidates for Chancellor 
Fox’s position this month.

Though a trip on the Roger 
Revelle can cost more than $40,000, 
the Shipfunds program covers full 
costs for students. Applegate said 
that he is excited by AGOR 28’s 
potential to expand Shipfunds. 

 "We're trying to cultivate the 
next generation of stewards of the 
sea,” he said. “These are the ones 
who will save the environment."

posal to tba@ucsd.edu. More infor-

In honor of “Pi Day,” council was gifted with pie from the public and from the Office 
of Finance. What 
a clever way to 
celebrate March 
14.  
     “It tastes good, 
I made it,” AVP 
College Affairs 
Leonard Bobbitt 
said about one of 
the pies presented 
to council by a member of the 
public. 
    Council was then addressed 
by Volunteer Connection, an 
organization that oversees 
five programs with the goal of 
providing innovative volunteer 
opportunities for UCSD students. 
The organization has grown from 
75 to 937 weekly contacts at UCSD 
from last year.

UCSD Mock Trial addressed 
council to ask for financing to fly 
to Minnesota for nationals. This 
is the first time UCSD has ever 
made it to mock trial’s national 
competition. They were granted 
$4050 in funding as an underwrite, 
or interest-free loan that needs to 
be repaid by June 30.

The Office of Finance addressed 
council to discuss some of its 
current projects.

“I help [VP Finance and 
Resources] Kevin [Hoang] with 
whatever he needs, whether it’s 
sending an email or getting him 
coffee or being his friend,” Office 
of Finance Chief of Staff Bryan 
Cassella said.

After this presentation, council 
took a three-minute recess to serve 
and eat the aforementioned pie.

Council came back into session 
to hear another special presentation 

from the Office of External Affairs, 
who discussed the Fund the UC 
campaign, a three-step program 

including tax 
initiatives, a 
middle-class 
scholarship bill 
and a reform of 
Prop. 13. 

Prop 
13 allows 
government 
spending to 

pass with only half of legislators’ 
votes, but requires two-thirds to 
increase tax revenues. 

The suggested reform would 
lower the two-thirds threshold for 
increasing tax revenues to one-half.

With a vote of 22-0-7, council 
confirmed the appointment of Brad 
Segal as campuswide senator.

Engineering Senator Parminder 
Sandhu presented a resolution 
honoring AVP of Academic Affairs 
Mac Zilber — who is graduating 
at the end of this quarter — as 
a lifelong member of ASUCSD. 
Zilber, who has been part of 
council for the past three years, was 
also given a signed copy of Oh! The 
Places You’ll Go by, who else, Dr. 
Seuss.

VP Student Life Meredith 
Madnick announced that sausage 
and fresh fruit will both be new food 
options at the A.S. Pancake Breakfast 
next Monday.

AVP of Student Services Leigh 
Mason strutted her stuff as last 
week’s Councilmember of the Week. 
I was given the prestigious honor for 
this week, and I high-fived and fist-
bumped councilmembers wearing 
my new pink foam crown, as I will 
not be returning to write “New 
Business” next quarter. I’ll miss you 
too, council.

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU/GUARDIAN

If you are sick of sloppy keggers and unsanitary beer pong tournaments, it’s time to class up 
your act and throw a party that won’t 
end with some girl puking on the 
door of your bathroom. You need to 
throw a dinner party.

First step is the guest list: Choose 
a group that will be cohesive and can 
actually converse without sending the 
party into the awkward zone before 
the two-buck chuck kicks in. An 

even ratio of guys to gals is ideal, and 
it is best if they all have something 
overarching in common (all are on 
A.S. Council, all are in the Greek 
system, etc.). Five to eight guests are 
manageable and affordable.

Next challenge: the food. For 
beginning cooks, stick to easy, pre-
made Trader Joe’s classics. Pre-cut 
salad, fancy frozen appetizers and 
some pasta doused in your favorite 
off-the-shelf sauce is your best bet if 
you’re the type of chef who can’t even 
flip an egg.

For the budding Julia Child, your 
greatest challenge will be the main 
dish. Thankfully, many chicken 
dishes are both easy and fancy, as 
long as you stick to one tried-and-
true ingredient: butter. Whether 
you choose something like chicken 
cordon bleu or chicken florentine, 
these pop-in-the-oven classics will up 
the cholesterol one night for the sake 
of an absolutely scrumptious dinner. 

If you don’t know much about 
wine, choose a few bottles that 
have the most distinctive labels you 
can find — they will make great 
conversation starters. Or casually 
scrape off the signature Charles Shaw 
label.

It is important to get the timing 
right for cooking so that you just 
finish up as your guests arrive. This 
will allow you to greet your guests 
with the wafting smells of your 
buttery dinner — and don’t forget to 
greet them in an apron, preferably 
one that isn’t bloodstained with the 
chopping mistakes of hours past. To 
establish the right mood, crank up a 
classy playlist: think classics like Sam 
Cooke, Patsy Cline and Elvis Presley.

As your guests settle down, 
make sure to serve everyone else 
first — the host always eats last. 
When people finish up their dinner, 
immediately clear the plates and 
put them in the dishwasher or start 
hand washing them. You are going 
to love yourself in the morning when 
you aren’t greeted by a stack of dirty 
dishes in the morning. Let your 
friends help — if they want — after 
all, you just did everything else. 

 Dessert is easy — just pick up 
some sorbet or cute baked goods 
from Trader Joe’s and let your guests 
go at it. Conclude the night with a 
board game — never underestimate 
the crowd-pleasing appeal of buzzed-
Jenga. With the right atmosphere, 
food and booze, your party will be a 
rousing success. 

And if it was truly memorable, 
everyone will want to do it again next 
week. Just make sure it isn’t at your 
house again.

Dinner Party

How-to
      Guru
opinion@ucsdguardian.org

 

Gather ’round readers, we have some news to share: After over a 
decade in our current digs, the 
Guardian is moving. Our perch 
above Groundwork Books in 
the Old Student Center is being 
taken over by the growing 
Craft Center, relegating this 
newspaper to the Old Media 
Lounge a few doors down.

What’s worse, that same 
office notoriously belonged to 
our BFFs the Koala before they 
were exiled to Price Center 
early this year (so thank Sun 
God we’re getting new carpet). 
Working in the same place 
could be seen as a slap in the 
face of our integrity, but the 
move provides a fresh start 
we’re eager to make the most 
of (and the new furniture and 
repairs don’t hurt).

See, the past few years 
haven’t been easy for the 
Guardian.  We began a 
huge initiative in 2010 to 
restructure the newspaper 
internally, so that — amongst 
paying increased student fees 
and covering protest after 
protest — we could begin 
digging ourselves out of pretty 
sizable hole of our own (read: 
debt).

The Guardian hasn’t 
been immune to the decline 
of print advertising and 
readership that’s affected most 
university and professional 
newspapers. Advertising is 
down, Twitter is king, more 
publications are moving 
online and, in many ways, 
it’s a luxury to continue 
producing a print product 
even twice a week. For us, it’s 

a luxury that comes at a high 
cost, given our less-than-stellar 
financial circumstances.

In other words, yes, the 
Guardian has been in debt 
for years, and no, we’re not 
ashamed, especially given 
the enormous strides made 
in the past two years toward 
alleviating said debt. In Fall 
Quarter 2011, we cut all 
non-editor pay — including 
writers, designers, artists and 
photographers — to reduce 

costs to the tune of nearly 
$30,000 per year. Nearly all the 
remaining editors have taken 
a pay cut, and we decreased 
our average paper size from 
16 pages to 12 to reduce print 
costs. We’ve restructured 
our staff, overhauled our 

production process and gone 
from marathon 6 a.m. uploads 
(and $75-per-hour late fees 
after our midnight deadline) 
to consistently leaving the 
office before midnight. And 
with a five-year plan in place 
and profit going up, the debt 
continues to shrink.

For those who are interested 
in logistics: The Guardian is 
supported by paid advertising 
solicited via a student 
advertising team. We receive 
no money from the Graduate 
Student Association or A.S. 
Council — the “Just in Case” 
ads that somewhat deceptively 
fill our pages are fill ads, part 
of our paid contract with 
A.S. Graphic Studios. We pay 
graphic designers to design 
advertisements and set up the 
pages; in return, they’ll put in 
some “fill” ads of their choice 
when we have extra space

Despite these financial 
missteps, the Guardian has 
always abided by a staff-drafted 
constitution and mission

community. Our coverage has received a bevy of 
California College Media Association awards — most 
notably for our coverage of the Compton Cookout in 
2009-10.

We’ve also made missteps. In the past, bereft of 
enough institutional memory and solid advertising 
and editorial policies, we’ve published articles that 
have divided the campus and even contradicted our 
own pre-existing advertising and editorial policies. We 
have welcomed (and will always welcome) constructive 
criticisms through emails or letters to the editor that 
we run twice weekly. Ask our art department: Once, 
we intended to correct the spelling of an artist’s name 
in our corrections box, but misspelled the artist’s name 
again. Mistakes happen, and if you let us know, we will 

fix it. Publicly. We look forward to creating more of a 
constructive dialogue between us and the constituents 
we serve — something we have lacked in the past. 

So as much as we’ll miss the stench of beer, Hi 
Thai and desperation that emanates from every inch 
of our cherished old office, it’s about time we started 
over. There will be many Sun Gods ahead of us to 
collect discarded feathers and dubious smells, years to 
cultivate various eating utensils from the dining halls 
and (probably) days before the same air of desperation 
follows us to our new place.

We’ll be the first to admit that the Guardian has a 
number of problems, financial and otherwise, but in 
the true spirit of college journalism, the students are 
given the power to make or break our product, and 
that is certainly something to celebrate.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
My last letter about Division-I 

athletics contains an inaccurate 
statement. About 50 percent of 
recruited athletes are in the bottom 
third of their class. This is quite 
different from stating, as my 
letter did, that 50 percent of the 
bottom third are recruited athletes. 
Furthermore, these statistics are for 
schools with large Division-IA and 
Division-IAA sports programs.  

I apologize for the error.

The Afghan War Must 
Come to an End
Dear Editor,

The Afghan War has been going 
on entirely too long.  

For more than 10 years now, the 
combination of the Iraq War and 
the Afghan War is taking more and 
more of a greatly negative effect on 
the U.S. troops, the U.S. debt and, 
I truly believe, the U.S. population 
as a whole! The resent massacre of 
Afghan citizens reminded me of the 
My Lai Massacre that happened in 
Vietnam in 1968.  

I had to look-up the information 
about this Vietnam Massacre, but I 
clearly remember, as a 10-year-old, 

the great controversy and the many 
of our citizens that took both sides 
of this controversy! I never served 
in the U.S. Armed Forces, but I 
remember, very vividly, how many, 
many young men — or should I say 
teenagers — were trying every way, 
even moving to Canada, in order to 
stay out of the Vietnam War!

 “War is hell” — even the U.S. 
Secretary of Defense said these 
very words before television and 
newspaper reporters only a few days 
ago.  If “war is hell,” then why in 
the name of sanity does humanity 
engage in it so much?  Perhaps 
only God knows!  In closing, I 
would like to say, “The U.S. troops 
that continue to fight are doing 
the American citizens a greater 
service than we can ever repay!” 
My question to the war-mongers in 
Washington, D.C. is, “How can you 
ever wash the blood of the fallen 
and injured troops off your hands 
from two wars that have been going 
on entirely too long?”

Downloading 
Music Is 
Progress, Not 
Theft
T here are no regrets when it comes to illegally downloading music. The record industry will try to tell you 
that you should feel a deep sense of guilt 

— as if you were actually, physically steal-
ing the albums you download — but in 
reality, it’s easy to get past “thievery” when 
there’s zero chance of ever getting caught. 

I’ll be the first to admit that I may just 
be making excuses for my inconsistent 
morality. But I also believe art should be 
accessible to everyone — not just the few 
who can afford to have a satisfying and 
diverse record collection. 

Ironically, unlike music download-
ing, I tend to feel a deeper sense of regret 
when it comes to actually purchasing 
music — mostly because I’ve wasted 
money on total crap.

There were so many factors that went 
into what albums I eventually purchased 
— namely, what the store was actually 
carrying (especially if it was a used record 
store), what was on sale or what I could 
remember I even wanted as soon as I 
started wandering the aisles. 

Picture this frequent spectacle: me, 13 
years old, discovering punk rock for the 
first time, wandering through the used 
section of Tower Records while collecting 
a giant stack of CDs to sort through later, 
overwhelmed, having just sold back my 
old pre-teen pop CDs from childhood 
so I could buy new, less embarrassing 
albums, eventually settling on whichever 
record struck the right balance of afford-
ability and desirability. The result: some 
terrible decisions (The Offspring) and 
some life-changing ones (The Strokes). 

All my friends bought CDs in the 
same hit-or-miss way, and they’d burn 
them for me or (later on) let me upload 
them to my own iTunes, allowing me to 
slowly formulate a sizable but random 
music collection. 

But, as we all know, downloading 
music for free has become a lot easier in 

“I feel like if God had some sort of way of speaking, it would be through 
music.” 

That’s Ari Picker in the official press video for A Church That Fits Our 
Needs — the latest album from Picker’s indie-orchestra collective Lost in the 
Trees. If all the religious imagery makes the music sound a little grandiose, 
that’s because it is. In fact, it’s difficult to even classify Lost in the Trees as a 
touring rock band in any traditional sense. 

Picker himself is a classically-trained composer who studied film scoring at 
Boston’s Berklee School of Music, and with a living room full of cellos, violins, 
French horns and tubas, his cinematic approach drowns out any semblance 
of the DIY folk that his beautiful arrangements build upon. Halfway into a 
song like album pinnacle “Garden” — with driving strings and trembling choir 
swells à la Arcade Fire’s Funeral and Picker’s Thom Yorke-esque croon — it’s 
easy to forget you’re listening to a cut from an independent home-recorded 
release and not the soundtrack to some tender coming-of-age epic directed by 
Lasse Halström.

The album’s relentless sentimentalism can be attributed to its heartbreaking 
backstory. In 2009, Picker lost his mother, who took her own life after years of 
suffering from depression and mental illness. In this sense, A Church That Fits 
Our Needs is not only a dedication to Picker’s late mother — “a space for my 
mother’s soul to go,” he says in the same video — but also a form a therapy for 
Picker. Lyrically, the album explores both the beauty and ugliness of Picker’s 
upbringing, allowing him a platform to grieve and find solace in the fragment-
ed memories of his mother.

To be sure, the album shines on its own merit. With the help of his friends, 
musical colleagues and legendary Elliott Smith producer/collaborator Rob 
Schnapf, Picker has created an astoundingly personal meditation on nostalgia 
and loss — a church that fits his own needs, be they creative or therapeutic.

CONCERT PREVIEW Wild Thing Rock

Whether you’re a fan of Fleet Foxes’ wistful bucolic harmo-
nies that have become the staple of any respectable coffee shop 
soundtrack, it’s impossible to dispute that the band takes its 
music damn seriously.

Enter Poor Moon, the bouncing, pop-minded side-project 
of Fleet Foxes bassist Christian Wargo and keyboardist Casey 
Wescott.

Pieced together from a series of demos sent back and forth 
from Wargo and Wescott to brothers Ian and Peter Murray (the 
Christmas Cards) during Fleet Foxes’ 2008 tour, Poor Moon’s 
debut EP Illusion is a delightful collection of pop-rock grooves 
that land somewhere between the Zombies’ bittersweet witti-
cism and the summertime jangle of the Tornados. 

It’s quite a departure from the duo’s mothership sound, but 
from the band’s deceptively fun name (it’s taken from the title 
of Wargo’s favorite Canned Heat song) to its bizarrely photo-
shopped, yearbook-style press photos, such is to be expected. 
Having already gained some critical attention, Poor Moon offers 
a goldmine of clever and efficient indie rock songwriting, and 
one promising surprise cut from the flannel-print cloth of one 
of modern folk’s rare mainstream success stories.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MARCH 16,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9

H olding up a voice recorder, Jeff (Jason Siegel) gazes out into the hori-
zon and chronicles his 
inner philosophy. 

“You ever feel like 
you were waiting forever 
to figure out what your 
destiny is?” he says. 

Once he finishes his 
monologue, he clicks 
off the old-fashioned tape recorder — 

and gets off the toilet.
It’s a winning combination of sen-

timentality and absurd 
humor — and precisely 
what makes “Jeff, Who 
Lives at Home” such a 
delight.

A 30-year-old stoner 
who lives in the basement 
of his childhood home, 
Jeff devoutly lives his life 

based on the ideology of M. Night 

Shyamalan’s “Signs,” believing there 
are no coincidences and that every-
thing happens for a reason. No one 
seems to have shown Jeff “The Last 
Airbender.”

Jeff ’s family is in a rut. His brother, 
Pat (Ed Helms) is kind of a dick. 
Okay, not “kind of.” He is a dick. Jeff 
can hardly stand him, and vice versa. 
But maybe it’s destiny that brings 
them together after Pat goes down a 
spiral of family issues with his wife 

Linda (Judy Greer). 
Pat’s insecurities with Linda lead 

the brothers to spy on her. During a 
horribly yet hilariously awry attempt 
at surveillance, Jeff and Pat meet a 
variety of obstacles, all directly influ-
enced by the current destinies of the 
characters. Jeff, notable for his fashion 
sense — a hoodie and basketball 
shorts, a classic lazy stoner ensemble 
— struggles to get a table by the win-
dow at a fancy bistro. Then again, the 
arduous task of infiltrating a fancy bis-
tro is a more difficult challenge than 
simply getting a specific table. 

Likewise, Jeff ’s mother, Sharon 
(Susan Sarandon), is physically and 
emotionally worn out. She’s angry and 
frustrated at her son and morose from 
years of loneliness. It doesn’t help that 
neither son wished her happy birthday 
early in the day.

At the foundation of these acute 
degrees of separation is Jeff, lost and 
insecure, and still living with his 
mom. The tension and frustration 
between him and not only his mom 
but also Pat, pushes all three charac-
ters to their tipping point when inter-
acting with each other.

As the overly emotional heart of 
the family, Jeff at first feels like a weak 
and ineffectual character. He’s barely 

able to get off the toilet and into the 
kitchen. At most, he can half-open 
a packet of pop tarts for breakfast 
before putting it in his mouth. But Jeff 
believes that destiny has more in store 
for him. As he becomes more and 
more determined to realize his sup-
posed destiny, the more compelling 
he becomes. And to the film’s credit, 
his devotion isn’t a constant joke. 
True, there are moments of humor as 
Jeff becomes obsessed with the name 
Kevin, whether it’s on a jersey or on 
the side of a truck, but Jeff isn’t always 
wrong about his assertions.

Like any other movie directed 
by brothers Jay and Mark Duplass, 
the film follows the same path down 
the mumblecore genre, just like their 
other films (“Cyrus,” “Baghead”). As 
the pioneers of the humorous, yet 
horribly titled micro-genre, these 
handheld and low-budget comedies 
are marked by their intense close-
ness to their subjects. Every character 
blemish is thrown on screen without 
trepidation. 

This is what adds color to Jeff, Pat 
and Susan, as well as the surrounding 
characters. Although unreal at times, 
the honest presentation of these 
quirks makes the film light hearted 
but still emotionally resonant.

recent years, making it possible for 
music collections to grow without 
the stress of spending money. Now, 
thanks to the Internet, being a musi-
cal connoisseur is no longer a luxury. 
It’s equally easy to cultivate a taste for 
the highbrow and a taste for the low-
brow, since downloading music from 
Thelonious Monk is no different from 
downloading Rihanna. It’s also easier 
to take risks on artists, because there’s 
no cost apart from the time it takes 
you to download an album, listen to it 
and then promptly discard it to your 

desktop trash bin. 
Unfortunately, it looks like times 

will be changing yet again. Since 
file-sharing website Megaupload 
was taken down on piracy allega-
tions (obviously, all true), finding 
links to albums on similar sites like 
Mediafire is growing increasingly dif-
ficult. Coupled with the recent threat 
of SOPA and PIPA in Congress, it’s 
hardly unreasonable to anticipate a 
future in which people are forced to 
pay for music again.

Let us put aside the important fact 
that this is a severe knock to Internet 
freedom and instead focus on what 

this could mean for us as simple 
appreciators of music.

There’s a certain honorable nos-
talgia in the old way of consuming 
music. Plus, I’m now older, wiser and 
less impressed by men with mohawks, 
so going to a record store might be a 
less haphazard experience than it was 
when I was a kid. I could, foreseeably, 
give my vinyl collection a fighting 
shot and take to buying records again. 
But ripping albums from my USB 
record player to my computer is a 
tedious process, and I enjoy the new 
musical landscape in which my collec-
tion can fit in my pocket and follow 

me everywhere.
This same logic also eliminates 

the possibility of fully relying on pro-
grams like Spotify as well, though I 
could upgrade to a Spotify Premium 
account or turn to the iTunes store if 
I was serious about keeping my iPod 
up to date.

But such costly solutions ignore 
the root of the problem: Music-
listening is really better when it’s free. 
We may not have as communal of 
music experiences anymore, no longer 
holding burning sessions with friends 
or sitting around the record player 
together. Instead, we have far more 

personal music experiences, given 
that we can alter our collections as 
we please — not as the record store’s 
stock or your finances please. 

The sheer act of downloading 
music already limits access for many 
people in the world — for one, you 
need a computer with Internet access 
before you can even consider down-
loading anything. 

So without the incredible 
resource of file-sharing at all, many 
more would have their capacity for 
experiencing great art severely lim-
ited, and that’s certainly something 
to fight for.

ALBUM REVIEWS

T he most immediately notice-able aspect of Silent Hour / Golden Mile EP, the first full 
solo release by Grizzly Bear’s Daniel 
Rossen, is that it sounds a lot like 
Grizzly Bear. Almost exactly like 
Grizzly Bear. From the chiming, 
multi-tracked guitars to the softly 
booming timpani and muted wood-

winds, many of the elements here 
are far from new additions to the 
Grizzly Bear oeuvre. However, with 
his dexterous songwriting ability and 
soaring, otherworldly voice, Rossen 
manages to breathe new life into 
the Veckatimest formula, delivering 
a set of subtly gorgeous folk songs 
that, along with his recent work with 
Department of Eagles, should estab-
lish Rossen’s standing as one of our 
era’s finest songwriters.

Opening track “Up On High” 
begins with a warm, Faheyesque 
series of acoustic guitar chords before 
blossoming into a rambling string-
assisted folk-rock track, with Rossen 
declaring that “in this big empty room 
/ you finally feel free.” Indeed, one 
gets the feeling that Rossen feels a 

greater sense of artistic liberty in this 
setting. Case in point: the sprawling, 
album-highlight piano ballad “Saint 
Nothing.” Over the course of a plain-
tive five minutes, Rossen navigates an 
achingly beautiful, delicately recorded 
accompaniment of piano and wood-
wind. Particularly remarkable is 
Rossen’s willingness to allow silence to 
take hold of the track: it never seems 
to rise above a whisper, rendering 
Rossen’s lilting melody all the more 
heartbreaking.

At a brisk twenty-four minutes, 
Silent Hour / Golden Mile leaves the 
listener with a fulfilling, cohesive 
document that never outstays its wel-
come.

A fter their Howard Zinn-inspired sophomore album History From Below in 2010, 
San Diego natives Delta Spirit are 
releasing their third, self-titled LP, and 
it falls far from the heights they’ve 
reached over their folk-filled past.

Self-titled Delta Spirit has 

attempted to distance the band from 
its retro-folk stigma and modernize 
its sound, featuring noticeably louder, 
atmosphere-laden tunes. 

Although Delta Spirit has tried 
to abandon their 1960s influence, 
that doesn’t mean they’re fully caught 
up to the 21st century. “Tear It Up” 
sounds influenced by early ’80s pro-
gressive rock, akin to Genesis or Yes, 
with ambient guitar, clackety drums 
and a repetitive chorus, while “Tellin’ 
The Mud” jumbles post-punk yelling 
with a backdrop of noisy garage guitar 
simultaneously reminiscent of Sonic 
Youth and My Morning Jacket.

While the sound has been updat-
ed, the lyrics still deal with timeless 
issues such as love and loss, especially 

since one member recently married 
and another ended a relationship. 
“California” is a disheartening break-
up song, with Beach Boys-inspired 
harmonies and a surf-rock intro befit-
ting the song’s title.

But part of what made Delta 
Spirit’s past two records so memorable 
was the raspy twang of Matt Vasquez’s 
vocals, the raw and almost religious 
tone of the lyrics, the band’s eclectic 
use of instruments (such as trash can 
lids) and its sheer passion in perform-
ing — all of which are absent on this 
album.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MARCH 15,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

of bounds.
Denying the inbounder, UCSD 

forced a 5-second violation — a 
make-up call on Ulmer’s part — that 
gave the Tritons another chance with 
the ball on their own side of the 
court.

With six seconds left, and all 606 
in attendance still on their feet, the 
Tritons found Feder, who had no 
choice but to force a tough shot from 
25 feet out. Feder, leading all scorers 
with 22 points on the night, missed 
her mark as Alaska Anchorage took 
the West Region crown.

“There were some things that we 
executed to perfection, we just didn’t 
get some of the breaks,” UCSD head 
coach Charity Elliott said. 

A few conversions on a few 
near misses may have stemmed 
the bleeding, and cut Anchorage’s 
momentum early on. Dautremont 
was 2 of 7 within her first 11 minutes 
on the court, missing her jumpers 
from the elbow and a couple shots 
down on the block. Feder went 4 of 
11 by the end of the first half, forcing 
Carlisle to pick up the slack. 

Conversely, Anchorage ended the 
first period with a 10-point lead on 
55.6 percent from behind the arc, all 
largely without the help of Johansson 
whose three early fouls kept her on 
the bench.

“In the first half, we wanted to 
really walk the ball up the court. 

We thought it would frustrate them 
a little bit to control tempo,” Alaska 
Anchorage head coach Tim Moser 
said. “I thought the two teams that 
played them earlier did a poor job of 
trying to run with them, especially at 
their home court.”

 Ranked No. 1 in the nation 
between Jan. 20 and its conference 
semifinal loss to CSU Los Angeles on 
March 2, UCSD caused Division-II 
coaches to agonize over how to beat 
UCSD’s fast-paced transition game. 
But with bigger, stronger inside posts 
matched with a very competent point 
guard in King, Moser seems to have 
found the key.

“I thought we had the advantage 
in the half court, and I thought if we 
got that game in the half court, we 
would win it,” Moser said. 

UCSD managed to mount a 
comeback midway through the 
second half when Feder caught fire, 
cutting the lead down to just one 
point at the 9:30 minute mark and 
again in the last minute of regulation. 
But it was too little, too late as the 
Tritons still couldn’t figure out a way 
to match up against Johansson, who 
overwhelmed UCSD on the post.

“[Alaska Anchorage] has such 
size inside. They outweigh us in so 
many different categories and we 
really had a tough time,” Elliott said. 
“We tried everything. We tried some 
zone, we tried doubling down. But 
when [Johansson] caught inside it 

was almost two points automatically.”
With the defeat in the single 

elimination NCAA Division II 
tournament, UCSD ends its historic 
season with a 30–3 overall record. 
The 2011-12 squad set a school 
record for its 26 consecutive wins. 

The loss marks the last game for 
Triton seniors Feder, Carlisle and 
center Lauren Freidenberg. The “Big 
Three” combined for 40 points in the 
West Regional final, with Carlisle and 
Feder both named to the West Region 
All-Tournament team. 

“[Our seniors] played their hearts 
out and that even makes it more 
difficult to end it that way,” Elliot 
said. “This class was the first class 
that I signed when I got here, and I 
just couldn’t be more proud of their 
efforts.”

Second seed Alaska Anchorage 
will advance to the Elite Eight in San 
Antonio, Texas next week, where they 
will face the second seed from the 
Midwest Region, Ashland University.

“It’s been the most amazing ride 
I’ve ever been on in my life and 
it’s been a whole lot of fun, and it’s 
going to be hard waking up in the 
morning realizing that we don’t get 
to practice,” Elliott said. “Alaska’s a 
great team, and it’s unfortunate that 
both of us couldn’t be going on to the 
elite eight.”

Triton seniors Chelsea Carlisle, 

Daisy Feder and Lauren Freidenberg 

graduate having amassed the longest 

winning streak in school history in their 

fourth season at UCSD. The �rst class 

to be recruited by UCSD head coach 

Charity Elliott started in all 33 games 

for the Tritons. The trio led the team in 

scoring—Carlisle averaging 16.4 points, 

Feder with 15 points and Freidenberg 

with 12.1 points. Carlisle �nishes as a 

two-time All-American, having been 

named to the All-CCAA team all of her 

four years. Feder along with Freiden-

berg were both named to the All-CCAA 

�rst team in the 2011-2012 season. 

Of the graduating class, UCSD 

head coach Charity Elliott said that she 

couldn’t be more proud of what the 

trio has done in their four years here.

“I’d go to battle with these three 

today and I’m just overwhelmed with 

the pride that I have for them,” Elliott 

said. “They’ve represented UCSD so 

well. And I don’t know how I get up 

tomorrow realizing that they’re gone.”

In what should have been ruled a jump ball

Dautremont her fourth foul of the night, sending
