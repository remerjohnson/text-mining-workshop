N. Korea: 
A Nuclear 

Debate 
U CSD political experts 
discuss ramifications 
of the communist 
nation's recent atomic 
explosion. 

By Dennis Tran 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

A panel of political experts met 
last week at UCSD's Institute of the 
Americas to discuss the worldwide 
repercussions of North Korea's recent 
nuclear test, including the impact 
of economic sanctions and how the 
test will affect the political stability of 
northeast Asia. 

The panel included political sci-
ence professor and UC Institute of 
Global Conflict and Cooperation 
Director Susan Shirk, Korea-Pacific 
studies professor Stephan Haggard and 
research fellow and northeast Asian 
and Chinese security issues specialist 
Tai Ming Ch,eung. 

The panel focused on reactions 
from the United States, China, Japan 
and South Korea, that, along with 
Russia, have participated in six-party 
talks with North Korea over the past 
few years in an effort to curb the coun-
try's development of nuclear weapons. 

Haggard began the discussion 
with background history on the North 
Korean nuclear fiasco, organizing 
the North Korean timeline by major 
events such as the Six-party talks and 
President George W. Bush's notorious 
2002 State of the Union speech, dur-
ing which he grouped North Korea,

O n the evening of Oct. 13, UCSD echoed with the sound of electric 
guitar and grating vocals. The 
campus buzzed with anticipated 
excitement - FallFest 2006 was 
officially underway, and three 
bands had promised to break 
the sleepy college atmosphere 
with their high-energy riffs and 
lyrics. 

FallFest opened with Danger: 
Radio, a baby-faced band from 
Seattle for whom the audience 

had high hopes. Rumors had 
circuIIted on the Internet that 
Danger intended to playa cover 
of Michael Jackson's "Thriller; '. 
which had spawned - among 
other things - a Facebook event i 
involving a group of girls' inten-
tion to "do the Thriller dance" at '. 
the concert for the press. '. 

Danger disappointed; '. 
"Thriller" never happened. The 
band rebounded, though, with 
a series of '80s-influenced popl " 
rock songs designed to boost the :: 
audience's energy.

ASSEMBLY 
ENCOURAGES 

TOBACCO

Question of tobacco-
funded research boils 
down to academic 
freedom debate. 

By Nedn Oreizy 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

The UC Academic Assembly rec-
ommended to the Board of Regent 
in a resolution not to reject tobacco-
funded research at UC schools on 
the basis of moral or political stand -
ing by a vote of27 to 16 at their Oct. 
11 meeting. 

The resolution began with a rec-
ommendation to uphold a precedent 
created in 2005, that only gave the 
regents the right to prevent facul -
ty from receiving donations based 
solely on the funding source. The 
assembly also passed two related 
motions that both support academic 
freedom and assert that the tobacco 
industry has been known to sup-
press academic freedom in the past, 
according to Academic Senate Chair 
John B. Oakley 

Med Center Makes $48M Miscalculation -

According to John Pierce, a pro-
fessor and associate director for 
cancer prevention at the Moores 
Cancer Center, the center and the 
department of family and preventa-
tive medicine were among the first 
to decide on a ban for the acceptance 
of tobacco research money by their 
members. This came after David 
Burn, a clinical professor in the 
department was unable to receive a 
settlement grant due to a stipulation 
that recipients couldn't be involved 
in a group that had taken tobacco 
money in the past. 

When Burns presented the issue 
to the Academic Senate for review, 
the body voted that he couldn't 
accept it, and that an academic unit 
like the department of family and 
preventive medicine had no right 
to restrict academic freedom in that 
way. They also decided that system-
wide money should not bt; taken 
from foundations that restrict aca-
demic freedom. 

UCSD hospital 
overreports wage costs 
for Medicare services, 
but is. halted by 
government audit. 

By Sonia Mlndot 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

The three-year interval between 
the 2004 calculations and the final-
ization of thost: figures in 2007 
allowed agency officials to review 
and correct mistakes - like the $48-
million overcharge for pension ,osts 
- as well as settle any disputes from 
the medical center over the fmdings 
of these mistakes. 

According to the report, the cur-
rent Medicare hospital payment 
system is based 0 n predetermined 
rates. which include costs for pen-
sion and postretirement wages. The 
OIG claimed that the medical center 
failed to adhere to the system, gross-
ly overstating its average hospital 
employee's hourly rate due to inac-
curately calculating pension benefit 
amounts. 

UCSD biology professor Darwin 
Berg's research is partially funded 
by tobacco company Phillip Morris. 
but he said he has not been adversely 
affected by his other donors. 

The UCSD Medical Center mis-
calculated its 2004 hospital wage 
costs to Medicare and Medicaid ser-
vices, an error that could have poten-
tially cost the federal government 
agency approximately $48 million 
in its 2007 payment to 18 hospitals 
in the University of California sys-
tem, acco~ding to a recent report by 
the Office of Inspector General of 
the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. 

Specifically, the OIG reported 
that the medical center overstated

Chemicals May Add 
Details to Memories 
In a recent study with rats, 

researchers from UC Irvine dis-
covered that the level of a che mi -
cal signal in the brain determines 
how detailed memories will late r 
become. ' 

The ne urotransmitter ace-
tylcho line, a che mi cal a lready 
known to be c ritical in learning 
and memory, is now thought to 
be the key to attaching detail s to 
memories. 

Norman Weinberger, a, UC 
Irvine research professor of neu-
robiology a nd behaVior, and eol-
leagues determi ned that higher 
levels of acetylcholine during 
learning tasks correlated with 
more facets of the experience 
being remembered . 

The study exposed rats to 
tones of different frequencies, 
which were paired with stimula-
tion to the nucleus basal is, the 
brain region that relays a ud itory 
commands by secreti ng acety l-
choline. 

During some experiments, 
stimu lation was weak, whereas 
in others it was stronger. When 
tones were replayed the follOWing 
day, scientists measured how we ll 
the rats remembered the frequen -
cies by calculating c hanges in 
respiration rates. 

The results showed that wea ker 
activatio n of the nucleu~ basalis, 
which corresponds to lower ace-
tylcholine release, led the rats to 
remember the tones but not spe-
cific frequenCies, whereas with 
greater stimulation and more ace-

tylchol ine, rats could remember 
frequencies along with the tones. 

The results are the first to 
discover the link between acetyl-
choline and memory specifi city 
and could have implications for 
trea ting memory-related di sor-
ders . 

Campus Researchers Get 
Counterterrorism Funds 

The National Institutes of 
Health have awarded UCSD fac-
ulty members five-year grants for 
two projects designed to devel-
op new and improved medica l 
co untermeasures agai nst chemi-
cal threats . 

Professor of medicine Gerald 
R. Boss was awarded $3.3 million 
for both precli nica l and clinical 
studies of a detoxifying agent for 
cyanide, a highly toxic chemical 
that cou ld be potentially used 
as a weapon of mass destruc-
tion. In addition, Skaggs School 
of Pharmacy a nd Pharmaceutica l 
Sciences Dean a nd pharmacology 
professor Palmer Taylor received 
$3.46 million to develop meth-
ods (or degrading nerve gas and 
eliminati ng toxicity after expo-
sure. 

The grants are meant to sup-
port therapeutics a nd techniques 
to improve the United States' 
medical response c apabilities 
in the event of terrorist c hemi-
cal attacks, or other widespread 
disasters such as chemica l spills. 
The NIH intends to commit about 
$10 million this year fo r such 
projects.

Smoking Pot May Stave Alzheimer's 
A new study suggests 
that marijuanas active 
ingredient may inhibit 
plaque buildup in 
Alzheimer's patients. 

By Joshua Christensen 
CONTR IBUTING WRITER 

A recent study from scientists at 
La Jolla's Scripps Research Institute 
suggests that the active ingredient 
in marijuana, te trahydrocannabi-
nol . may someday prove to be an 
effective treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease, a debilitating degenerative 
memory disorder. 

The dementia caused by 
Alzheimer's disease is debilitating to 
both memory and language capac-
ity. currently affecting approxi -
mately 4.5 million Americans. Five 
percent of the population over 65 
years old. and more than half the 
population over 85 now has the 
disease, according to the National 
Institute on Aging. In addition, 
the Alzheimer's Association esti-
mates that the number of affected 
Americans could increase to 16 
million by 2050. 

There is no cure for Alzheimer's, 
and the causes remain a mystery. 
But help may be on the way in the 
form ofTHC. Alzheimer's patients 
all show unusuall y high levels of a 
key enzyme. acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) . which forms a kind of 
plaque in the brain. According to 
the study. dopenzil and tacrine. 
two leading drugs in the treat -
ment of Alzheimer's patients, show 
only 22 percent and 7 percent 
effectiveness in inhibition of the 
enzyme. respectively. However. 
the study suggests that THC has 
shown significant effectiveness at 
stopping the effect on aggregation 

- blocking it "completely." But the 
study, which was supporled by the 
National Institutes of Health, is 
still in its infancy. 

THC "may provide an improved 
therapeutic for Alzheimer's dis-
ease" that would treat "both the 
symptoms and progression" of the 
disease. the study stated. 

Dr. Kim Janda, a chemist at SRI. 
a member of the Skaggs Institute for 
Chemical Biology and the author 
of the study, declined to comment, 
and said that the study "has been 

Our results are 
conclusive enough to 

warrant further 
investigation?' 

- Dr. Kim Janda, 
Study Author, Scripps 

Research Institute 

badly politicized and taken out of 
context by the media:' 

However. in an SRI press 
release, Janda stressed the signifi-
cance of the new findings while 
also denouncing illegal drug use. 

"While we are certainly not 
advocating the use of illegal drugs, 
these findings offer convi ncing evi -
dence that THC possesses remark-
able inhibitory qualities. especially 
when compared to AChE inhibi -
tors currently available to patients," 
Janda stated. 

Other authors of the study, 
titled "A Molecular Link Between 
the Active Component of 
Marijuana and Alzheimer's Disease 
Pathology," include SRI researchers 
Lisa M. Eubanks. Claude J. Rogers 
and Tobin J. Dickerson. 

According to the press release. 
any new treatment that could halt 
or even slow the progression of the 
disea e would have a major impact 
on the quality of life for patients. 
including reducing the staggering 
costs associated with the disease. 
A survey from the National Center 
for Health Statistics stated that half 
of all nursing home residents have 
the disorder, and the NIA estimated 
that Alzheimer's- related treatment 
costs are $100 billion annually. 

Although skeptics have histori -. 
cally questioned marijuana's poten -
tial as a viable medical drug. the 
study's results strongly suggest a 
realistic possibility of a new treat -
ment for the mysterious disease. 
Marijuana is currently labeled as 
a "schedule-one" drug by the U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration 
- the most restricted category 
- meaning that even under medi -
cal supervision, it is unsafe to use. 
However, many states. including 
California. have legalized the med -
ical use of marijuana. 

Currently, there are four 
FDA-approved treatments for 
Alzheimer's that work by inhibit-
ing the active site of AChE. and 
marijuana's potential has given sci -
entists at SRl the desire to advance 
their research . 

"Our results are conclusive 
enough to warrant further inves-
tigation." Janda stated in a press 
release. 

Although the research has dem-
onstrated that THC can prevent 
the mental decline associated with 
the disease, marijuana is not nec-
essarily good for the mind . Other 
studies have suggested that heavy 
marijuana use can impair memory 
and users' ability to pay attention 
to more than one thing at a time.

Teacher s Got a Gun 
Arming Teachers 
Could Save Lives 

By)im Shen 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

I n the wake of several school .shootings in the past few months across the nation, Wisconsin state Assemblyman Frank Lasee (R-Bellevue) proposed a measure that 
would allow teachers, with the proper training, to carry 
firearm on campus. While many have ctismissed the idea 
as out of hand, a serious look at this proposal shows it does 
have some merit. 

Bringing firearms onto school grounds is not without 
precedence. Before the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, 
which prohibited firearms Within 1,000 feet of a school cam-
pus, many schools had rifle teams, with both teachers and 
students keeping firearms locked in their cars. 

In Thailand, the government relaxed its otherwise strict 

PRO 
gun control policies for teachers in 
the wake of several school shoot-
ings in 2003 as well as an Islamic 
insurgency that began in 2004 that 

targeted several schools. At least one teacher in Thailand has 
escaped death at the hands of gunmen by shooting back at 
them while making his escape. And after the Ma'a1ot mas-
sacre in 1974, Israel placed armed guards inside schools. 
Since then, the only instance of outsiders killing Israeli 
schoolchildren was in 1997, when a Jordanian soldier 
gunned down seven Israeli schoolgirls as they visited the 
Jordanian border. 

While [srael and Thailand face more extreme circum-
stances than those in Wisconsin, their responses show 
that arming teachers or placing guards on campus is a 
viable option. Even in the United States, a principal with 
a handgun accomplished what multitudes of gun control 
laws could not: He successfully stopped a school shoot-
ing in progress. During the Pearl High School, Tennessee 
hooting in 1997, in which student Luke Woodham killed

Prevention, Nonlethal 
Options Are Best Bet 

By Daniel Nguyen 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

L ast month, Wisconsin state Assemblyman Frank Lasee (R-Bellevue) proposed a bill that would allow teachers to carry concealed firearms on campus, 
claiming it would make schools safer. He argued that 
many other countries such as Israel and Thailand have 
already given teachers the right to carry concealed fire-
arms at school, providing schools with a safer learning 
environment. But there are plenty of reasons why such 
a measure is impractical: In fact, it may make things 
worse. 

For one, it's expensive. It costs about $300 to train one 
person to use firearms and obtain a certificate allowing 
for the possession of concealed firearms. Furthermore, 
teachers would need a required 
40 hours of instruction to receive 
the certificate. Schools would also 
have to provide teachers with fire-

CON 
arms, such as a .22 caliber handgun, which costs about 
$250 apiece. Public schools are simply not in the finan-
cial shape to be spending that kind of money per armed 
teacher. California lags behind most of the nation in 
average amount of operational expenditure per student 
and amount of money invested in public education. With 
schools complaining about a lack of funding for such basic 
necessities as textbooks, is it reasonable to spend much-
needed dollars on training teachers to wield firearms? 

Far from making students safer, putting handguns in 
classrooms might malee schools even more dangerous. 
With guns already on campus, a student with intent to kill 
wouldn't have to go through the trouble of bringing their 
own weapon. How hard would it be to overpower a single 
teacher, or maybe find an unattended gun? What about a 
potentially violent teacher who might use their weapon

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-~--- Disenchanted 
With Second-

Year Digs 
Hillcrest Hospital 
Move a Mistake 

Dear Editor, 
It seems to me that UCSD is 

malting a big mistake in closing the 
Hillcrest hospital. Why is UCSD mov-
ing resources away from the largest 
growing population and into La joUa? 
Last time I checked, there are many 
quality hospitals fuUy equipped with 
inpatient services within minutes of 
campus. 

UCSD is ignoring the fact that the 
lower class residents in South County 
won't have access to health care while 
we'U have yet another hospital campus 
nearby. And their solution is to tell 
residenls of that area to fmd transport 
up here? As if traffic around campus 
isn't already a problem during peale 
hours. The editorial in your paper 
("Economical Hospital Move Will 
Hurt Needy: Oct. 12) notes that by 
the time UCSD closes all of the beds 
at the Hillcrest hospital, south and 
central San Diego will be over full 
capacity for care, so where will all the 
people go? The bottom line is that we 
don't need an addition to Thornton 
here in La Jolla, and people in south 
San Diego need access to a full-service 
hospital dose to their homes. UCSD 
needs to stop thinking about making 
money and consider the impact on 
the community instead. .

Need Jobs? Let's Give 
Students Guns! 

Dear Editor, 
"It is a melancholy object" that 

those citizens whose children are of 
school age mustÂ·again be made aware 
of the dangers that lie within thtse 
academic institulions. The evenlS of 

the past week have, for some citizens, 
reopened wounds left by the tragedies 
that occurred at Columbine High 
School seven years ago. 

These events, though tragic, have 
also served to galvanize orne of these 
citizens to causes whose efforts are 
occasionally classified as being "anti-
gun:' This galvanic aftershock, how-
ever, has also drawn the attention of 
other citizens away from these trag-
edies, and instead, spurred them to 
focus their energies and efforts to 
protect what they believe to be threats 
toward their right under the Second 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

Unfortunately, these initial reac-
tions bear the telltale signs of politi-
cization - and so provide little hope 
that any meaningful change will come 
for those remaining citizens who 
merely ask that the safety of their 
children be considered. 

But, rest assured, J intend to do 
more here than simply provide a nar-
rative of these events. 

I, for my part, having turned my 
thoughts upon this important sub-
ject, and weighing several possible 
solutions to prevent further tragedies 
from occurring, have derived a pro-
posal that is mutually beneficial for 
citizens on both sides of this debate. 

Instead of investing time and 
money in keeping guns out of schools, 
why not simply enact legislation that 
would require each child be provid-
ed with a handgun as they arrive at 
school each morning. and each gun 
coUected as each child leaves in the 
afternoon? This policy would ensure 
the safety of this nation's children (not 
to mention protecting their Second 
Amendment rights) by enabling each 
child to defend them self from anyone 
who wished them harm. 

This policy would, in addilion to 
the issue it is intended to address, pro-
vide for a potential increase in domes-
tic economic growth at a time when

jobs are being outsourced to nations 
overseas. According to the Consumer 
Federation of America Foundalion, 
in 1997 alone, the U.S. gun industry 
domestically produced 3.6 million 
guns - 1.4 million handguns, and 2.2 
million rifles and shotguns. The rev-
enue garnered by these sales, if added 
to the sale of ammunition, totaled 
over S 1.3 billion. 

Based on statistics gleaned from 
the 2005 census, it is estimated that 
the total number of preschoolers 
(under age five) in the United States 
is 20.3 million, ~Iementary-age chil-
dren (5- 13): 36.1 million, and high 
school -age children (14-17): 17. 1 
million. 

Therefore, we may say that 
apprOJdmately 73.5 million school-
age . children live within the United 
States. As of 200 I , employment in the 
small-arms industry had leveled off at 
approximately 7,000 employees (earn-
ing approximately S 16.75/hour).lf the 
proposal described here is adopted as 
an article of legislation, an immedi-
ate demand would be created for an 
additional 73.5 million small arms 
- which could potentially generate as 
many as 14,300 new jobs.

Shady Politics Behind 
Marijuana Ban? 

Dear Editor, 
I'm writing about: "Let's Face the 

Truth, America: A War on Drugs [s a 
War On Ourselves' (Oct. 12). 

Beyond just the use of marijuana 
as medicine, why do so many of our 
politicians want to keep a natural 
herb, that has never been documented 
to kill a single' person, a criminalized 
substance? Why do apparently intel-
ligent people want to arrest and jail 
other people who use or seU an easy-
to-grow weed? 

Perhaps to understand their posi-
tion we should study the history of 
u.s. alcohol prohibition. The notori-
ous gangster AI Capone made most 
of his illegal money from alcohol 
prohibition. Capone often bragged 
that he "owned" the city of Chicago. 
Obviously, he didn't own all of the 
city of Chicago; however, he had 
mosl or aU of Ihe polilicians and 
police who ran the city on his pay-
roll. AI Capone was a successful 
businessman and ilis not unreason-
able to suspect that the drug cartels 
of loday are following his business 
model. 

It's also not unreasonable to sus-
pect that the drug cartels may have 
many high-level politicians and police 
officials on their payroll. Obviously, 
the type of politicians the drug cartels 
would have on their payroll are those 
who advocate the continuation of the 
status quo of drug prohibition, which 
is making the drug cartels so fabu-
lously wealthy. 

I'm not saying that any specific so-
called "drug warrior" is on the payroll 
of the drug cartels. I'm just a little 
suspicious of the motives of all of the , 
drug-war cheerleaders.

â¢ SHOES, from page 4 
Our first -floor space evidently 

attracts no sunlight. Outsid~ it's 2 
p.m. on a sunny afternoon but in 
my living room it's the dead of night. 
As you can imagine, by thi poim 
my shins are well acquainted with 
the coffee table. However, despite the 
blind escapade that ensues each day 
my friends remain avid energy-sav-
ing sticklers. , 

Don't gel me wrong power sav-
ing is the way to be, but this is the 
Alaskan dark season we're talking 
about. My apartmentmates pr.obably 
prefer the dark because they appar-
ently require much more sleep than 
me. No all-nighters with this bunch. 
On the contrary, they don't share my 
tendency toward procrastination and 
distraction. There has been many an 
evening that I find myself the only one 
awake as early as midnight. What's 
more ridiculous? My apartmentmates 
aren't In-N-Out fans; these health nuts 
say no to meat in favor of green beans. 
Vegetables? I say pass the French fries, 
the saltier the better. Guess I should 
have paid closer attention to that "sub-
tle compatibility" thing. 

While the apartments seemed to 
be a paradise for second years, they 
are in practice a dreary concrete maze 
of isolated suites thaI hold no special 
freedom beyond that of the residence 
halls. So if you happen to be look-
ing for company and your apartment-
mates are busy doing something silly 
like finishing homework in a timely 
manner or eating tofu, you're basi-
cally shit out of luck. You can't really 
make conversation with the kids in the 
hou e lounge, because there aren't any. 
And obviously second years are just 
too cool for the campus-sponsored 
friend -meeting ice cream socials.

6 OPINION 

Arming Teachers Could 
Be Useful Crime Deterrent 
~ PRO, from page 4 
two and injured seven other students, 
principal Joel Myrick violated federal 
law by keeping a handgun in his truck; 
Myrick retrieved the weapon and sub-
dued Woodham before he could harm 
anybody else. Myrick didn't even need 
to fU'e a shot. 

Even though merely brandishing a 
gun at a suicidal attacker may not per-
suade him to surrender, having one on 
hand at least allows teachers to defend 
both themselves and their students. 
Having a firefight in a school hallway 
is not much of an improvement over 
a massacre, but it accomplishes two 
th ings that not having armed teach-
ers does not. In the event of a school 
shooting, having armed teachers or 
other personnel engaging the attack-
ers would buy time for students to 
escape. Obviously, these teachers 
would need extensive training as out-
lined in Lasee's proposal, not just in 
how to handle a fLrearm and accurate 
shooting but proper tactics on how to 
employ them. For armed teachers to 
be useful , they would need training 
on how to make quick tactical deci-
sions to best protect students with or 
without the use of a weapon. 

Additionally, the weapons used by 
school faculty must minimize the risks 
of collateral damage in the event they 

are actually used. To this end, teachers 
might be restricted to fi rearms such 
as handguns loaded with frangible 
ammunition - which breaks up into 
small particles upon impact with a 
hard surface - to reduce the risks of 
ricochets or passing through walls. 

The mo t important point of hav-
ing armed staff members on a school 
campus is to deter a school shooting 
from ever happening. Criminals are 
far more likely to attack a defenseless 
target, and all the gun control laws in 
the world will not prevent a criminal 
from breaking the law and bringing a 
firearm to a campus. Having a cred-
ible armed presence, not a security 
guard who fires in the attacker's gen-
eral direction and flees - like during 
the Columbine High School shooting 
- would provide an effective deter-
rent against anything short of a suicide 
bomber. 

The most important question to 
consider, of course, is whether the 
security risks at American schools 
justify such a response. Even with a 
string of recent school shootings, it is 
clear that while the chances of a sui-
cidal gunman or student walking into 
a school are fairly low, the threat still 
exists. Arming teachers with the right 
training and weapons may provide a 
solution. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 16,2006 

Parental Involvement Better Than Guns 
â¢ CON, from page 4 
in an inappropriate situation? Even 
with the best fLrearms training, there 
is still the chance of an acciden-
tal shooting. With possibilities like 
these, it's easy to see how having 
weapons on campus is more a threat 
than a safety precaution . 

Giving teachers - or anyone, 
for that matter - a gun implies that 
they are meant to use the weap-
on. This expectation would weigh 
heavily on the minds of students 
and the people who teach them. 
Guns give teachers a superfluous 
amount of power over student s, 
which if abused, could have disas-
trous consequences, such as teach-
ers opening fLre on students. Under 
these conditions, the atmosphere 
at school would resemble that of 
a prison as opposed to a learning 
environment. 

According to an ABC News 
report on school shootings, most 
shootings end with the shooter tak-
ing h.is or her own life. In addition, 
most cases show that the assail-
ants suffered from mental disorders 
such as depression. Will giving guns 
to teachers solve this problem? 

It would seem more logical to 
address the actual problem - which 
is that there are mentally unstable 
students who need help. Waiting 
for things to boil over, resulting in 
school shootings, is unacceptable. 

Perhaps instead of arming teach-
ers, the problem could be stopped 
by taking action with parents. It is 
the parents' responsibility to nurture 
and raise a child. It is also the parents' 
responsibility to make sure that the 
child is not suffering from mental 
illnesses. Incidents like Columbine 
and the 1998 school shooting in 
SpringfLeld, Oreg., would probably 

" ftpper spray, bean-~1iag gunS or even 
Tasers would provide 
adequate protection 

without the risks 
associated with 

handguns?' 

never have happened had the parents 
of the children paid closer attention 
to what their kids were dOing. 

And in the Columbine shootfng, 
fellow peers knew ahead of time that 
students were coming to school with 
the intent to harm other students. 
Students must report suspicious 
activity to school authorities as soon 

as possible. 
If safety were the main concern, 

schools would be better off hir-
ing security guards as opposed to 
arming teachers. Security guards are 
better trained for hostile situations, 
and they spend their careers dealing 
with dangerous situations. Teachers, 
on the other hand, are hired to 
teach, not to act as enforcers and 
protectors. 

And if arming teachers seems 
necessary, why not start with non-
lethal weappns? Pepper spray, bean-
bag guns or even Tasers would pro-
vide adequate protection without 
the risks associated with handguns. 
(Also, the cost of training teachers 
to use Tasers is about $75, much less 
than the cost of handgun training.) 
Furthermore, a Taser would take 
down anyone regardless of where 
they are hit, as opposed to a hand-
gun, which would have to hit assail-
ants in specific areas to eliminate 
the threat. And with any of these 
options, the risk of accidental (or 
even intentional) fatalities would be 
minimal. 

There are many alternatives to 
arming teachers if safety is the pri-
mary concern. Students shouldn't 
have to fear teachers in a learn-
ing environment. Arming teachers 
with handguns - even with .the 
best intentions - is fighting fLee 
with fire.

Me4 Center Accepts Changes to Wage Estimates California Voters to Decide 
Education Facility Funding â¢ MEDICAL, from page 1 pension wage costs by $22 mil-

lion, and overstated postretirement 
wage costs by 525 million. The 
newly-issued corrections propose a 
19-percent decrease from the UC-
released hourly wage averages, from 
$41.74 to $33.75. 

The medical center, though, 
refuted the agency's accusations of 
miscalculation. In a written state-
ment to the OIG, the center claimed 
that it determined costs using gen-
erally accepted accounting prin-

cipï¿½es. 
Furthermore, June 2003 changes 

to the accounting manual used to 
estimate the hospital's reimburse-
ment were "ambiguous," according 
to the medical center's statement, 
and a 2005 Federal Registrar request 
to liquidate pension and postretire-
ment accruals complicated rather 
than clarified GAAP policies. 

The medical center argued that 
the OIG's claim of miscalculation 
was based on policy changes that 
were applied after inspections were 
made, and therefore, the medical 
center cannot be faulted in its wage 
reports. 

"The Medicare wage index is 
used in determining a portion of 
Medicare payments we receive for 
med. patients," said Bob Hogan, 
ehief financial officer for the UCSD 
Medical Center. "Every part of the 
country pays different wages, and 
Medicare tries to adjust their index 
according to these differences:' 

Medicare payments are deter-
mined by other factors as well , such 
as facility and construction fees; the 

two changes collectively account for 
Medicaid and Medicare fees used 
to treat Medicare patients in U C 
hospitals. 

Complications arise, however, 
when Medicare tries to calculate the 
costs of pension benefits, according 
to Hogan. 

"Pension benefits are considered 
part of costs paid of t;mployees," 
Hogan said. "It has to do with what 
your liabilities are and future liabili-

. e we could appeal 
a ecision to fight [the 
audit], it was best to 

comply at this time. Â». 
- Bob Hogan, 

Chief Financial Offfcer, 
UCSD Medical Center 

ties, as opposed to payment$ going 
toward payment funds." 

The uncertainty of future legal 
responsibility makes it difficult to 
define wages. 

Often, Hogan said, "It's a 'differ-
ence of opinion on how to count 
pension costs." 

UC officials insist that their esti-
mations were in compliance with 
Medicare regulations and guidance. 

"Because the UC pension plan 
was fully-funded at the time of the 
2004 wage report, the OIG's ,view 
is that UC medical centen did not 
actually incur a cost or liability 

- i.e., UC costs are 'covered' by the 
pension plan surplus and therefore, 
do not represent actual costs," UC 
Office of the President spokesman 
Paul Schwartz stated in an e-mail. 

In defense of the center's meth-
odology in measuring wage costs, 
Hogan said he is skeptical of the 
consistency of federal officials' con-
duct. 

The difference in opinion within 
the federal system perplexed medi-
cal center officials. 

"We were working closely with 
Medicare services to explain finan-
cial accounts,W Hogan said. "But the 
Office of Inspector General did a 
review on an audit, and came up 
with a different conclusion." 

Despite frustration, the UCSD 
Medical Center has agreed to accept 
any change in wage estimates, and 
currently there is no possibility of 
a lawsuit. 

"While we could appeal a deci -
sion to fLght it, it was best to comply 
at this time;' Hogan said. 

Adjustments to GAAP pro-
cedures signify a change in how 
Medicare wiU report wage-related 
costs in the future. 

"While this represents a lost 
revenue opportunity, it does not 
represent any actual fmancial loss 
or necessitate repayment of UC 
funds," Schwartz stated. 

The revised reporting proto-
col applies not only to the UCSD 
Medical Center, but to all five medi-
cal centers within the UC system.

Among California's 13 propositions 
for this election, the Kindergarten-
University Public Education Facilities 
Bond Act, which would provide fund-
ing for K -12 and higher education 
facilities over the next two years, is 
weighing heavy on the hearts of coUege 
officials this November. 

Last June, the University of 
California Board of Regents endorsed 
the proposition, also known as 
Proposition 10" which would grant 
$10.4 billion to education, namely 
$345 million per year to the University 
of California for facilities programs 
and an additional 5200 million over 
the two-year period to expand the 
University's medical scvhools and 
enhance telemedicine programs. 

Of the 5345 million set aside for 
the 10 UC campuses, 594.5 million 
would be allocated to UCSD to enable 
the campus to progress on important 
building projects and improve existing 
facilities, a UCSD press release stated. 

Projects include 575.1 million for 
classrooms, research labs and offic-
es at the Structural and Materials 
Engineering Building, 513.1 million 
for renovations of the 43-year-old 
Mayer HaU, 522 million of equipment 
for the Music Building, $1 million for 
the second phase of the Rady School 
of Management facility and $3.2 mil-
lion for improvements to the campus' 
chilled water and electrical distribu-
tioo systems, the release stated. 

Across the state, the bonds would 

provide a remedy to overcrowded 
public K-12, college and university 
classrooms which house 75 percent 
more students than they were designed 
for, according to a UC Office of the 
President press release. 

Furthermore, the California 
Postsecondary Education Commission 
estimates 64,000 more students to enter 
the University of California by 2010. 

Along with enrollment growth, the 
proposition plans to address seismic 
and life safety needs, renewal of out-
dated infrastrllÂ£ture and upgrading 
university facilities in sdentific fields, 
according to the UCOP. Funds would 
also allow the univer$ity to continue 
construction plans for its campus at 
Merced. 

Opponents of Prop. ID, includ-
ing the California Taxpayer Protection 
Committee and California Political 
Review, believe that the bond is too 
large and argue that it would add to 
California's SI OO-billion debt. 

"California is facing the most severe 
fLnancial crisis in its history:' Executive 
Director for the California Taxpayer 
Protection Committee Thomas 
Hudson stated in a Legislative Analysts 
Office report. "The Legislature has 
squandered the opportunity to build 
new schools with the astounding 23 
percent growth in tax revenues over 
the past three years." 

Although the proposition costs 
510.4 billion, supporters call it a wise 
investment in California's future.

people can pursue the truth. To dictate 
what research is done at a univllrsity 
destroys the objectivity of a univer-
sity:' 

However, Assembly member and 
UC San Francisco professor Stanton 
A. Glantz, believes that new infor-
mation is now available to over-
turn the previous resolutions and 
clarify the regents' position toward a 
ban on tobacco-funded research. He 
cited the regents' previous decision 
to divest from tobacco stock in their 
investment portfolio, and argued ' 
that the tobacco industry has abused 
academic research and "manipulated 
the scientific process." Also, referring 
to a recent fed eral district court rul-
ing, Glantz argued that the industry

that I was corrupt, but I'm not cor-
rupt. This is a difference of opinion 
that Glantz has tried to turn into a 
scandal ." 

Enstrom said he does not believe 
it is likely that the regents will ignore 
the Academic Senate's recommenda-
tion, but conceded that the issue will 
not be finalized until the regents act 
on it. 

Stephen Green, a spokesman for 
Lt. Gov. and ex-officio Regent Cruz 
Bustamante, who brought the issue 
to the regents in September, said, 
"[ It's] not an issue [Bustamante] 
plans to give up on ."

â¢ KOREA, from page 1 
along with Iran and Iraq, in "an axis 
of evil." 

"North Korea is a regime arming 
with missiles and weapons of mass 
destruction, while starving its citi -
zens;' Bush said. "States like these, and 
their terrorist allies, constitute an axis 
of evil , arming to threaten the peace 
of the world. By seeking weapons of 
mass destruction, these regimes pose 
a grave and growing danger:' 

Haggard also discussed the reso-
nating effects of recent sanctions on 
North Korea's civil ian population, 
which has been plagued by famine 
and poor economic conditions for 
decades. 

"We are going to see food short-
ages in the spring;' Haggard said. "It's 
going to add a humanitarian dimen-
sion to the issues." 

Shirk focused her discussion on 
China's influence in the North Korean 
nuclear test and stressed China's pow-
erful position as one of North Korea's 
main allies. 

"China holds the key to ending 
North Korea's nuclear program," Shirk 
said. 

Shirk then wc;nt into further 
detail regarding China's relationship 
with Japan and how that relation-
ship has been strained by the nuclear 
test. Shirk said China, which has 
had a historically strained relation-
ship with Japan, had f1l1ally gained 
ground after a recent visit from 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
Addressing Japan's concerns dur-
ing the trip, China's leaders assured 
Abe of a non-nuclear North Korea. 
However, the nuclear test soon after 
proved otherwise. 

"The timing of the test is viewed 
by China as a big slap in the face," 
Shirk said. 

Cheung addressed North Korea's 
ideology and political motivations. 
Chelmg viewed the nuclear test as 
a bargaining chip that North Korea 
could use to achieve its goal: the

removal of economic sanctions 
imposed by the United States. 
Therefore, the recent test was, he 
said, just a taste of things to come. 

"North Koreans will still contin-
ue to test their nuclear capabilities 
as well as their missile capabilities," 
Cheung said. 

Tensions between North Korea 
and the United States have escalated 
in recent years, especially in the wake 
of the stalled six-party talks. 

Those tensions came to a head on 
Oct. 3, when North Korea announced 
its intentions to conduct a nuclear 
test regardless of any international 
dissent. Six days later, North Korea 
made good on its word, detonating 
a device underground that triggered 
seismic readings throughout north-
east Asil. U.S. officials estimated that 
the explosion was equivalent to 500 
metric tons of TNT. 

In response to the country's claim, 
the United Nations Security Council 
issued a unanimous condemnation 
of the explosion. 

However, North Korea's U.N. 
ambassador, Pak Kil-yon, said lISt 
week that the council should "con-

gratulate" his country's scientists and 
researchers on their achievement, 
instead of issuing what he called 
"notorious, useless and reckless reso-
lutions." 

As of Oct. 13, air samples taken 
from North Korea are consistent 
with a nuclear test, according to U.S. 
intelligence officials as reported on 
CNN. 

The U.N. Security Council passed 
another unanimous resolution on 
Oct. 14 imposing sanctions on the 
isolated communist country. 

The resolution requires that 
Pyongyang not conduct further nucle-
ar tests or launch any type of ballistic 
missile, and demands that the coun-
try abandon all programs to develop 
weapons of mass destruction. 

It also bans trade in luxury goods, 
and requires me~ber states to freeze 
the assets of North Korean entities 
and individuals. 

The North Korean government 
has called the sanctions a declaration 
of war.

Headlining 
Band Calls 

Campus 'USC' 
â¢ FALLFEST, from page 1 

Eleanor Roosevelt CoUege fresh-
man M ina Ahmad praised "the 
(band's) guitars and solos; while near-
by, another girl screamed, "I love hot 
hat man'" referring to Danger's lead 
singer, Andrew de Torres. 

At about 8:30 p.rn, Danger left the 
stage, and were replaced by rockJ rap 
entrepreneurs Gym Class Heroes. The 
Heroes used pinky promiles and short 
comedy sketches between songs to 
boost the crowd's participation. 

Lead singer Travis McCoy's rap-
like lyrics blended with the dance- rock 
beats played by his band - and for the 
first few Heroes songs, the audience's 
energy skyrocketed. 

When McCoy shot down pop 
star Justin Timberlake's c1aim of "I'm 
bringing sexy back," however, the 
energy began to wane. Even McCoy's 
dever, "The next time you run into 
[Timberlake] on the street,l want you 
to tell him that [sexy's] already been 
broughten," failed to boost audience 
participation, and ultimately many 
students judged the Heroes to be a 
"downer." 

"I really didn't \ike them at all;' said 
Nick Edwards, a local San Diegan who 
paid to attend the concert with two 
friends. "They sucked ... We don't 
actually know why we're still here. 
Other than 'cause we paid:' 

Two FallFest security guards, both 
of whom declined to give their names, 
agreed. After Heroes left the stage, 
they said that FaIlFest 2006 was one 
of the calmest concerts they had ever 
~ 

11'1 actually really dull; one said. 
"And the bandssucJc, which makes our 
job harder, because we can't even enjoy 
the music.-

By the time headlining band Hot 
HotHeat took the stase. RIMAC Arena 
seeriled entirdy lifdeu. Name recogni-
tioo did. h~, earn Hot Hot Heat 
the right to a packed floor and an 
active mosh pit, complete with crowd 
surfrn and windmilling. 

The Canadian qlj3rtet's unique style 
set them apart from the openers. Lead 
singer Steve Bays was a multitalented 
master, combining fast-paced lyrics 
with personal keyboard stylings and 
synchronized dance mows. 

At one point, Bays asked, "How's 
USC tonight?" and was met by a thick 
silence. However, Hot Hot Heat's single 
"Middle of Nowhere" elicited more 
audience participation than any other 
song all night. 

"I \iked Hot Hot Heat a lot,Â· 
Thurgood Marshall College sopho-
more Jennifer Hines said "I had never 
heard of them before, and I ended 
up really having a good time at the 
concert" 

While some students were happy 
with the lineup, others expressed 
satisfaction with the choices. A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming D.i 
Lam stated in an e-mail that. con-
trary to criticism, all three bands were 
chosen from student input back in 
August. 

"It is relatively difficult to find 
bands to play FalIFest,- Lam stated_ 
"For the past few years, arena-sized art-
ists .. . like the AU-American Rejects, 
Mwe [and) Death Cab for Cutie ... 
ha", been requesting more and more 
money. but because the FalIFest [bud-
get] has remained the same ($70.000), 
it has been getting harder and harder to 
find a band willing to play." 

Still , Fall Fest attracted about. 
4,100 students and 400 paid music-
lovers, which, though I smaller 
turnout than last year, was still suc-
cessful considering the day's raln, 
according to Lam. 

Most attendees ultimately had a 
good time at the concert. 

"I thought the concert started out 
with a really great band and ended 
with a lot of energy:' RewlIe College 
sophomore Manprm MUDllDIIl said 
"Ovmll, 1 thouaht it __ I great con-
cert."

Colleges Send the SAT the Small Envelope 
UCSD has remained 
firm in its use of the 
SAT in evaluating 
applicants, despite a 
growing movement to 
drop the test. 

By Malthew Leavitt 
ASSOCIATE fOCUS EDITOR 

For years the SAT has been the gatekeeper to a college career. Without an SAT (or 
equivalent A.C: f.) score, preferably 
as perfect as pOSSible, most colleges 
will not accept ~n application. But 
critics say the test's structure seems 
cruel and heartless, created spe-
cifically for those wealthy enough 
to train Rocky-style for a gauntlet 
of convoluted word problems and 
archaic analogies. Although it is 
a gross oversimplification to say 
that some did not get into college 
because they could not tell when 
Johnnie, who started going 15 miles 
per hour east at 1 a.m., will meet 
Susie, who began traveling west at 
20 miles per hour 200 miles from 
Johnnie at 2 a.m., it is not too far 
from the truth. As doubt grows 
concerning the effectiveness of the 
test, and its ability to accurately 
gauge a student's aptitude, some 
colleges have decided to completely 
ignore the SAT, despite its domi-
nance of the Educational Testing 
Service system. 

Henry Chauncey is one of the 
main proponents of the SAT today. 
He was the first director of ETS 
and a key figure in the formation 
of standardized testing during the 
19305 and '405. He is also one of the 
biggest critics of the test's use. In 
an interview with PBS for its show 
"Secrets of the SAT," Chauncey 
attacked those who recommend 

eliminating the SAT, 
"I think they're cutting off their 

nose to spite their face or some-
thing." Chauncey said. "I think the 
thing is to use the SAT as one of a 
number of factors. But I think it'd be 
less fair in admissions if you th row 
it out. My atlitude was always that 
the tests were useful and very help-
ful, but they weren't everything. You 
had to take into account the school 
record, or whatever other records 
you had in malting any decisions, 
so that I'm I guess a bit unhappy 
with the uses to which some col-
leges, or some institutions put this." 
Chauncey's sentiments were echoed 
in Richard Atkinson's, then presi-
dent of the University of California, 
monumental address to the 83rd 
annual meeting of the American 
Council on Education in 2001. 

In his speech, Atkinson called for 
less emphasis on the SAT and exam-
ination scores and more emphasis 
on the applicant's total resume. The 
buzzword of the time became Â·com-
prehensive review," an evolution-
ary dimension to admissions that 
has since changed the UC system. 
Three years ago, a report detail-
ing Berkeley's admissions system 
uncovered an extremely polarized 
pool of applicant$; some students 
were accepted with SAT scores of 
700. Critics said that in an attempt 
to make admissions more equitable, 
Berkeley devalued the SAT scores 
of some applicants and placed too 
much weight on extracurricular 
activities and social factors. 

UCSD has also sought a balanc-
ing act, according to the Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Admissions and 
Registration Mae W. Brown, who 
in 2004 explained the admissions 
system to @UCSD, an alumni mag-
azine. 

"This is not a personal judgment 
on the applicant." Brown stated. "It 
is as close to scientific as we can 

make it." 
The campus' system is based off 

of 1 \,100 total points. Students earn 
points for grades, test scores and 
socioeconomic factors . Their scores 
are put into an index and compared 
against competing applications. 
Wlfile UCSD does place a heavy 
considerat ion on grades and exami-
nation scores, it tries to account for 
factors outside of the SAT's range 
with personal essays that examine 
the student's quality of living and 
academic opportunities, 

Maine's Bates College, however, 
has taken it a step further. The 
campus has exorcised the test from 
its application reviews completely, 
and is one of the leaders at the 
forefront of optional testing admis-
sions. T~e college declared SAT 
scores optional to the admissions 
process in 1984. According to a 
study published on their Web site, 
Bates College has found no differ-
ence between those who chose to 
submit test scores and those who 
didn't with regards to their aca-
demic performance and graduation 
rate. One of the college's findings 
makes a bold statement: "Testing is 
not necessary for predicting good 
performance; the academic ratings 
assigned by Bates admissions staff 
are highly accurate for both sub 
mitters and nonsubmitters in pre-
dicting GPA." Students applying to 
Bates College must complete the 
Common Application for colleges 
and a supplementary essay explain-
ing why they want to attend Bates 
College. 

It is unfair, however, to draw a 
direct comparison between Bates 
College and the UC system, which 
is a far larger patron of the SATs_ 
Bates College enjoyed a total student 
population of 1,684 full -time stu-
dents for fall 2005, Last year, UCSD

California Favorable to Stem Cell Research 
~ GOLDSTEIN, from page 1 0 
cacy by active members in the field 
can not only go a long way toward 
counteracting the myths that some-
tiJnes enter the debate, but remind 
participants that the researchers 
themselves are citizens with strong 
opinions on what is right and wrong 
in their fields . 

Despite his passion for the field 
and the years he's devoted to it. he 
is respectful when he speaks of his 
opposition and is careful not to paint 
them with too broad a brush. He said 
that the controversy over stem ceUs 
is not just another dimension of the 
abortion debate, which he also took 
care not to simplify. 

"If you go from fertilization to 
birth there's a massive gray area, 
Goldstein said . "Everyone falls differ-
ently along that scale.Â» 

Along that scale are many who 
consider themselves pro-life, includ-
ing Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). 
Similarly, there are those who have 
opposed the research and Proposition 
71 for different reasons, including fis -
cal concerns. 

It's not a simple division between 
religious and nonreligious Â· groups; 
while Goldstein admits that many of 
those who condemn the practice are 
members of "the conservative wings 
of Christianity," there are still many 
who differ. "Many good, practicing 
Catholics disagree with the official 
stance of the Catholic church on this," 
Goldstein said. 

The issue is different across the 
United States, too, and each state 
has its own complexities. So far in 
California, the public seems to be 
satisfied with their reasons, as the 
proposition passed with a notable 
majority. 

California has not only proven to 
be amenable politically to Goldstein's 
research, but also has a scientific com-
munity that is weU suited to his ideas 
and work. He obtained his bachelor's 
degree in biology from UCSD, with 
a concentration in genetics, but for 
years his other work was done out of 
the state. He studied for his doctor-
ate at the University of Washington 
in Seattle, and did postdoctoral 
work at the University of Colorado 
and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. He also served on the 
faculty of Harvard University for 10 
years. Although those are impressive 
credentials, he still finds himself hap-
piest working at UCSD. California. 
he says, has a much more "freewheel-
ing" scientific community compared 
to formal East Coast universities. 
and he considers UCSD to be of 
equal academic caliber to Harvard. 
Most importantly, UCSD and other 
California universities are more open 
to interdisciplinary studies as a prac-
tice, which Goldstein said is crucial. 
Some of the most groundbreaking 
discoveries are made at the junctions 
between fields, he asserted. 

Most of his work at VCSD and 

While he still teaches graduate and 
medical students sometimes, and has 
taught undergraduate courses in the 
past. he prefers to focus on research. 
where he is certain he is more use-
ful. He looks forward to teaching a 
group of 15 to 16 trainees for UCSD's 
Stem CeU Program, since he finds 
small classes to be a more productive 
application of his teaching skills than 
larger lectures. 

Goldstein's enthusiasm about 
the program and the advances to 
medical science that may be made 
through human stem cell research 
is boundless. However, the ethical 
dilemmas caused by it are far from 
over. One issue that will almost cer-
tainly surface is the first experi -
mental treatments tested on human 
subjects. Stem cell researchers will 
face these and other dilemmas with 
which the entire field of health 
care and medical science regularly 
deal. These are perhaps even more 
important questions, says Goldstein, 
than the conflict over the possible 
humanity of a blastocyst. 

Through his extensive career in 
the field, Goldstein has faced quite 
a few forms of opposition, including 
the personal opinions of many. But 
his genuine passion for the field is 
unshakeable. and his view of detrac-
tors of human stem cell research 
remains respectful. 

"Someone might disagree," 
Goldstein said. "It doesn't make them 

other universities has been research . _ a bad person." 

Admissions Strive for Holistic Approach 
~ SAT, from page 13 
had 20,679 full -time students for 
its total undergraduate enrollment. 
The economies of scale between the 
two campuses provide serious dif-
ferences in the application process. 
While most high school juniors 
would agree with the persuasion of 
Bates College. many educators are 
calling for a revision of the SAT, not 
a revolution. 

The admissions office does not 
say whal score on the SAT will gar-
ner an admission to UCSD. but it 

does repeatedly state that applicants 
must exceed minimum requirements 
in order to get the large packet in the 
mail. According to the 2006 freshmen 
profIle, average scores for the SAT 
were 627, 664, and 636 for c.ritical 
reading, math and writing, respec-
tively. 

It seems the resources necessary 
to institute a testing-optional admis-
sions system are not yet at the dis-
posal of the University of California 
While some may bemoan ~ persis-
tence of the SAT and its use in admis-

sions, administrators are still weary 
of their dependence upon test scores. 
Atkinson outlined his hopes for the 
future of standardized testing. 

"Cbanging standardized test 
requirements is a step in the right 
direction, but in the best of circum-
stances there will be a tendency to 
overemphasize test scores~ Atkinson 
said. "Admissions officers at UC 
campuses recognize tbis problem 
and have introduced more holis-
tic. more comprehensive evaluation 
processes." 

uation doesn't have 
proudest moment.

UCSD Heads North to Finish Record Year Tritons Tear Through Foes 
With Six Games to Play ~ SHUTOUT, from page 20 

ing half of their goals in the first 
balf. Senior midfielder Kelly Cochran 
set the tone for the game and put 
through the first goal in the 21st 
minute on a header pass from feUow 
senior midfielder Heather Sugg. 

Senior midfielder Megan Dickey 
and sophomore forward Natasha 
Belak-Berger puUed together in the 
43rd minute to set up a solid pass 
to junior midfielder Ali Lai, who 
slammed it in from fIVe yards out. 

The Trfton teamwork was very 
obvious and essential during the 
game for creating plays, as every goal 
was on more than one touch. 

"Our team was doing a great job 
at connecting passes and being cre-
ative," McGovern said. "The goals 
were not just a matter of kicking the 
ball up-field and hoping someone 
was nearby to fetch it and take a lucky 
shot. like many of the teams we face 
tend to do:' 

The Tritons got tricky in demon-
strating their teamwork abilities after 
the intermission when senior for-
ward Alise Malley sent a pass across 
the box that drew out the Golden 
Eagle goalie_ Lai foUowed up by run-
ning over the ball without touching 
it to fake out the keeper, leaving an 
open net for junior forward Kathy 
Sepulveda to make the score to reach

The final goal came in the 77th 
minute of playas junior midfielder 
Lauren Segars beat the Cal State

Kelly Mayo and freshman Alexia

back to take a 20-18 advantage and 
never looked back. winning the first 
game 23-30. 

In game two. UCSD fell behind the 
Wildcats' 7-9, but regained the lead 
after senior setter Kristen Halvorsen 
served six Slraighl points. The run 
included kills by Schmidt and senior 
captain Nicole Courtney. 

After a Chico State timeout, UCSD 
pushed its lead to 25-17 on freshman 
Elaine Chen's service ace. Courtney 
got the fmal kill and the win for the 
Tritons. 30-20. 

The teams went back and forth in 
game three, with UCSD taking a 22-21 
edge. Chico State then used one kill 
and two aces to forge ahead 22-24. The 
Tritons regained the lead, 26-25. on a 
KochekiU. 

UCSD then fought off five game 
points when junior opposite Amber 
Ries and Koche combined for a huge 
block and a 34-33 advantage. Courtney 
again finished the game with a kiU. giv-
ing the women a 35-33 win. 

"It was most exciting single game of 
the season~ Black said "I don't think 
the score switched for the better part 
of the game and it was a real pressure 
situation. 

Kochecredited the win to the team's 
unwavering focus. 

"We didn't feel any pressure, we 
were just playing hard," she said. 

Chico State called a time out after 
the Tritons jumped to a 10-6 lead in 
the fourth game. The lead extended to 
13-7 before the Wildcats caught a sec-
ond wind. pushing the score to 14-12. 

UCSD took a dominating 22-14 
lead on a Halvorsen ace and eventuaUy 
took the game 30-22. 

The No. 14 Tritons conquered Cal 
State Stanislaus at the Warrior Gym on 
Oct. 14. 30-20,30-27.20-30,30-23. 

In game one, the women took seven 
of the fLIst nine points to establish the 

pace of the match. UCSD never looked 
back. extending its advantage to 23-17 
on SchmJdt's kiU. 

Courtney did the rest. scoring the 
team's final six points, which included 
two aces that finished off the game one 
victory, 30-20. 

Game two was a battle with 19 ties 
and eight lead changes. The teams 
exchanged points from 4-4 to 12-12 
before the Tritons were able to build 
a small 23-20 lead on a Cal Slate 
Stanislaus hitting error. only to see it 
evaporate into a 26-26 tie. 

The Warriors took a 26-27 lead on 
junior Iibero Natalie Facchini's service 
error. UCSD then turned to its big 
three of Courtney, sophomore outside 
hitter Rebecca Bailey and Koche to 
score a kill each and win the second 
game 30-27. 

The Tritons jumped out to a quick 
3-0 lead in game three but Cal State 
Stanislaus answered with nine straight 
points to take a 3-9 advantage. UCSD 
struggled the rest of the game, drop-
ping it 20-30. 

"We didn't play how we know how 
to plaY, Koche said. "It's a hard gym 
to play in but we still came back in the 
fourth game to win~ 

The team responded to the chal-
lenge in game four, using an 8-2 scor-
ing run to lead 17-11. Courtney fin-
ished the run with a kill and UCSD 
cruised in, winning 30-23 on Facchini's 
service ace. 

Koche, Bailey and Courtney led the 
Triton offense with 47 kills. Halvorsen 
added 46 assists in the match. 

The team is back in action Oct.

Women's Diving Welcomes Rookie Class Vasquez Withstands Flurry 
and Stops Six Shots in OT â¢ SWIM, from page 20 inspiring, and quite a few people 

swam very well for the first meet 
of the season;' senior Emily Harlan 
said. "We swam a very competitive 
meet against one another:' 

Harlan, of the gold leam, took 
fi rst in both the 50 and 100 free-
styles with times of 24.55 and 54.33, 
respectively. Senior Andrea Lippin 
led the way for the blue team in 
the 800 freestyle over junior Lauren 
Forbes of the gold team with a blaz-
ing time of 8:32.62, which narrowly 
missed the meet record. 

Senior Jenna Muenter and soph-
omore Kendall Bohn provided a 
one-two punch for the gold team 
in the 50 breaststroke with times 
of 32.00 and 32.39, respectively. 
Muenter and Bohn's performances 
in this event accrued a combined 13 
point , and help put the gold team 
over the blue team in the women's 
meet. 

The preseason intersquad meet 
allowed the' Tritons to comb the 
depths of their talent before regular 
season action starts this month. The 
meet spotlighted many outstand-
ing underclassmen swimmers, and 
pools ide observers didn't have to 
spend much time in the mast before 
they yelled, "Talent Ho!" 

Sophomore Artur Kubal ki won 
the 800 freestyle for the men's gold 
team with an impressive 8:05 fi n-
ish ahead of the blue team's fresh -
man Greg Goodell of the blue team. 
Sophomore Shannon Simonds of 
the gold team also looked excellent 
when she took first in the women's 
200 freestyle. 

Freshmen Karla Holman and 
Kevin Le each exploded out of the 
gates in the 150 butterfly event~ for 
the women's and men's blue teams. 
Holman ftnished first in the event, 
ahead of sophomore gold teamer 
Jennifer Sims, with a time of 1:34.33. 
Le swam a time of 1:22.44 to best 
senior Jesse Marin for first place and 
a record time in the Blue vs. Gold 
meet, highlighting a gifted fresh-
man class. 

Head coach McGihon has guid-
ed the women's team to four con-
secutive third-place finishes, and 
the men's team to three straight 
top-five finishes in the NCAA 
Championships. 

Just last year the women's team 
once again finished shy of a NCAA 
title with third place in the champi-
onships, led by alumna Sophie Levy, 
who won an individual national 
title in the 1650 freestyle with a 
school-record time of 16:57.99. The 
men's team finished fifth in the 
NCAA Championships. 

"This year we have all the poten-
tial to have an even better season 
than last year," senior Emily Harlan 
said. "The wome n's team only lost 
four seniors, and though they were 
very strong players on our team, I'm 
optim istic and excited for this year's 
new and returning talent. We took 
our smallest team ever to NCAAs 
last year, and we scored more points 

â¢ GOLDEN, from page 20 
offensive attack and led the team 
with five shots, two of which were 
on goal. 

The win was the Tritons' first in 
their past seven matches and upped 
their California Collegiate Athletic 
Association record to 5-6-2 and 
their overall record to 7-7-2 . UCSD 
now stands in fifth place in the 
South Division of the CCAA, four 
points behind Cal Poly Pomona and 
Cal State Los Angeles for the final 
playoff spot in the division. The 
loss dropped Cal State Los Angeles 
out of first place to econd place, 
one point behind league-leading Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. The Tritons 
will need to win their finaJ three 
matches of the season and get some 
help from other teams in the confer-
ence to earn a playoff berth. 

The Tritons played their final 

home game of the season on Oct . 
15 against Cal State Bakersfield, one 
of the teams they are chasing in the 
South Division standings. Results 
were not available at press time. 

Choi, who realized the obvious 
importance of the final regular sea-
son games, e mphasized the need for 
the Tritons to remain calm and play 
to their limits. 

"This is a huge game for the 
seniors and for the entire team, but 
we are trying to stay focused and 
approach it like every other game," 
Choi said. 

The Tritons will finish their sea-
son with two road games that will 
likely determine whether they will 
earn a postseason berth . UCSD will 
travel to San Francisco State on Oct. 
20 and finish the regular season 
against Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Oct. 22.

Moreira's goal in 
double-overtime lifts 
UCSD in do-or-die 
matchup over Cal 
State Los Angeles. 

By Brent Westcott 
STAFF W RI TER 

Rega rdless of whom they were 
playing, where they were playing 
or how they accomplished it, the 
UCSD men's soccer team desper-
ately needed a win. With a victory, 
the team would keep its dwindling 
playoff chanc;es alive, but with a 
defeat, the proverbial writing would 
have been on the wall. 

Fortu nately, the Tritons got 
that win , and it just so happened 
to be against first place Cal State 
Los Angeles in double-overt ime in 
front of a home crowd at Triton 
Soccer Stadium on Oct. 13. UCSD 
got a golden goal from senior mid -
fielder Mark Moreira one m inute 
into the second overtime to seal the 
1-0 victory, its fourth double-over-
time victory of the season. 

The Tritons scored their lone 
goal when freshman mid fielder 
Tony Choi played a ball through 
the box, allowing Moreira to blast 
a shot from seven yards out for 
the win. 

Choi, who cam e in from off 
the bench to provide the winning 
assist, was happy to be back on the 
winning side of match. 

"We were just excited to find 
out what winning was like again ." 
Choi said. "We hope to make this 
a habit." 

The goal was Moreira's team-

The Tritons ended their seven-game lo~-jng streak with a small but signijiamt 1-0 win on Oct. 13 in their fourth double-overtime game on the -: 
. season. Sophomore midjielder Michael Grobic kept pressure on the Golden Eagles to improve UCSD's overall record to 7-7-2. 

leading seventh of the season. 
"Mark [Moreira] came in with 

10 m inutes left in regulation so he 
had fresh legs and was able to put 
the pressure on," Choi said. 

The match featured plenty of 
scoring opportunities, with the 
Golden Eagles outshooting the 
Tritons 18- 14. The Tritons got a 
solid game from freshman goal-
keeper Joshua Vasquez, who mind-
ed the net for the entire 101 min-
utes of the match, earning the first 
shutout of his career. Vasquez made 

11 saves, including six in the two 
overtime periods. 

According to Choi, a 2-0 defeat 
at the hands of Cal State Los 
Angeles on Sept. 24 pressed the 
struggling Triton squad to intensify 
their play. 

"We went into the game look-
ing to play our best and avenge our 
loss to them earlier in the season," 
Choi said. 

UCSD seemed to be the fresh-
er team in the overtime periods, 
asserting their dominance on both 

ends of the field . 
"We came out really fired up for 

both overtimes and just wanted it 
more than they did," Choi said. 

Head coach Derek Armstrong 
again made several offensive-mind-
ed lineup changes in an attempt 
to jumpstart the struggling Triton 
offense, including playing senior 
defenseman Devon Cook at mid-
field . This move fared well for the 
Tritons, as Cook contributed to the

Count 'em: Wins 16 and 17 are 
in the books as the UCSD women's 
volleyball team earned its eighth and 
ninth straight victories Oct. 13 and 
14 over Chico State and Cal State 
Stanis1aus, respectively. 

The Tritons improved to 17-2 over-
all with a 12-2 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association record to move 
into second place behind Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

"It's coming down the home stretch 
and it's really important for us to stay 
focused," head coach Tom Black said. 
"Some teams are playing for something 
and others are playing for nothing and 
were playing for something:' 

Chico State handed the Tritons one 
of their two losses earlier this season, 
but the second try proved to be more 
than the Wildcats could handle as 
UCSD took them 23-30, 30-20, 35-33, 
30-22 on Oct. 13. 

"It was good to show them how the 
real UCSD women's volleyball team 
plays." senior middle blocker Brianna 
Kocbe said "We were really excited 
and we played with a lot of heart. Our 
blocking and defense just outnum-
bered theirs:' 

The Tritons took an early 8-5 lead 
on a kill by freshman middle blocker 
Sylvia Schmidt. Chico State battled

Despite the rain drops echoing 
on the bleachers and the buzz from 
nearby FallFest ringing in their ears, 
the Triton home crowd pulled together 
some impressive numbers to support 
the UCSD women's soccer team on 
Oct. 13. 

"The track team is always really 
supportive and it was interesting to 
have the cheerleaders at one of our 
games as well," sophomore goalkeeper 
Jessica McGovern said. "I was shocktd 
at how many people came; it really 
kept our spirits up:' 

The seriousness of the match was 
evident as UCSD aimed to earn the 
No. I spot in their division. Howner, 
the fans enabled the Tritons to keep
