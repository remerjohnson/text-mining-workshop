After a yearlong debate over stu-
dent priorities, the A.S. Council 
refused to raise student fees to 

fund campus transportation last 
night, when it voted to reject the 
Transportation Referendum.

The referendum would have cre-
ated a $25 quarterly undergraduate 
fee for busses and shuttles. Director 
of Parking and Transportation 
Services Brian d’Autremont said 
the fee would have been necessary 
to maintain current levels of free 
public transportation, and that the 
initiative’s failure will result in the 

elimination of popular bus lines. 
D’Autremont met with A.S. 

President Utsav Gupta and 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox on 
Tuesday to discuss the referendum, 
with the Chancellor acting as a 
mediator between the two parties. 

D’Autremont said he had hoped 
the council would see the transporta-
tion department’s need for funding. 
Before the meeting, he said the ref-
erendum’s failure would be a blow to 

sustainability. 
“I really want this referendum 

to pass because it’s important for 
sustainability,” he said. “I think most 
people support this, and if it doesn’t 
pass, it would be a big hit for finan-
cially disadvantaged students.” 

Although d’Autremont said 
results of the transportation survey 
sent out last April prove that stu-

A dozen security officers lined 
the back wall of Price Center 
Theater as Israeli Ambassador 
Michael Oren, surrounded by 
another half dozen escorts, spoke 
to an audience of about 500 people 
on Feb. 8.

Outside, 40 more gathered to 
protest Oren's visit to the school and 
his role in Israeli military affairs, 
chanting, “Occupation is a crime! 
Free, free Palestine!” and “Killing 
children is a crime! Zionists out of 
Palestine!”

Oren's presence stirred dis-
cussion of the historical dispute 
between Israelis and Palestinians 
over the West Bank, Gaza and Israel.

Oren — who was appointed 
Israeli ambassador in May 2009 by 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu — visited UCSD to 
speak about the U.S.-Israeli eco-
nomic, military and political rela-
tionship.

Tritons for Israel with Hillel of 
San Diego organized Oren's visit. 
Oren chose UCSD as one of the 
two schools in California he would 
speak at.

“We very rarely can have speak-
ers like this come to our campus,” 

Pro-Palestine protesters 
filled Price Center to
protest Israeli ambassador 
Michael Oren’s speech.

Admissions guidelines for prospective 
nonresident applicants may become more 
lenient. A committee for the UCSD Office of 
Admissions is considering loosening applicant 
requirements as a strategy to lure more out-of-
state students.

According to Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund, a member of the Committee on 
Admissions, the committee is considering a 

system called the academic index score to 
admit non-resident students, instead of the 
more stringent comprehensive review system 
that is currently used to admit all students.

Haglund said the idea was motivated by 
state budget cuts. Admitting non-
resident students brings in more 
revenue due to the additional fees 
they pay — $20,021 per year for 
tuition, as opposed to the $9,401 
paid by residents.

“Since the state budget has 
been reduced, admissions has 

been looking for different ways to save money, 
and every piece of info they can use to increase

UCSD researchers have discov-
ered how to use an STD to treat skin 
cancer. 

A team of scientists led by Dr. 
Gregory Daniels, assistant clinical 
professor of oncology at the Moores 
Cancer Center, has engineered the 
herpes virus to kill melanoma, or skin 
cancer, tumors. 

When a foreign substance, such as 
a virus, is introduced to the body, the 
immune system detects the change 
and begins to fight the entire area, 
killing the cancer present as well. 
The cancerous cells are not usually 
detected because they are integrated 
with the body’s cells. 

According to Daniels, surgeons 
have been using viruses to stimu-
late immune response to cancerous 
tumors since the 1880s.

“You can inject anything into can-
cer and kill it,” he said. “People inject 
weird stuff, and as long as it has toxic-

ity, it works.”
However, this treatment has been 

dangerous because some of the viruses 
made matters worse by spreading 
through the body, or causing cancer 
themselves. Now, the herpes virus can 
be engineered so that it is elicits the 
immune response while still being 
harmless for non-cancerous cells. 

Daniels’ team of researchers used 
recombinant DNA technology to 
delete the genes in the herpes virus 
that cause the disease and the genes 
that program the virus to spread, 
making it harmless to noncancerous 
cells while simultaneously eliciting an 
immune response. 

“We engineered the virus to delete 
harmful genes until we had a less 
robust version of herpes,” Daniels said. 

The herpes virus was then injected 
with the protein GM-CSF, which 
initiates the inflammatory immune 
system. 

“This causes a one-two response,” 
Daniels said. “The presence of the 
virus itself causes the immune system 

to be heightened, and by engineering 
it to carry the protein, we ensure that 
GM-CSF also creates a response.”

Daniels conducted a clinical study 
in which 50 patients with melanoma 
were injected with the virus twice 
weekly. 

“We saw over 80-percent success 
[rates] in the tumors,” Daniels said. 
“They just went away.”

In addition, Daniels said the 
virus elicited such a strong immune 
response throughout the entire body, 
that 20 percent of the patients saw 
melanoma tumors disappear from 

parts of their bodies not directly 
injected. 

This type of gene therapy can be 
used for other cancers as well.

“The therapy can also be used 
for head and neck cancers too, or 
any cancer that starts from the skin,” 
Daniels said. 

The next step is for the Food 
and Drug Administration to review 
Daniels’ study and decide whether this 
is a safe treatment for skin cancers.

EXPIRES 2/15/10

Maybe because Valentine’s Day is rapidly approach-ing, or maybe because 
councilmembers needed a reprieve 
after last week’s eight-and-a-half-hour 
marathon meeting, but a new feeling 
of giddiness filled the air this week.

Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund informed councilmembers 
that the Interfraternity Council will 
be holding a 
fundraiser next 
week to benefit 
the City of Hope 
Cancer Center. 
Joining the fra-
ternity members 
imprisoned in a 
makeshift jail cell on Library Walk 
will be Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue and A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta. 

John Cressey, a fifth-year and for-
mer A.S. councilmember, addressed 
the issue of council accountability 
during public input.

“Think of someone on A.S. that 
you can’t stand, and if the passion of 
your dislike for that person outweighs 
the passion you have for UCSD, 
then change your attitude or resign,” 
Cressey said. “You’re focusing on 
each other — that’s a Disassociated 
Students.”

Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo and AVP Diversity Affairs 
Jasmine Phillips explained the con-
cept behind “Do UC US?”, a cam-
paign that hopes to increase the num-
ber of black students at UCSD.

They said they intend to pressure 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to create 
programs that will increase campus 
diversity. 

Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy updated the council 
regarding his senator projects. Besides 
his proposed Committee on Student 
Activities and Relations and the A.S. 

Events Line, Kenworthy offered some 
new ideas: a changed location for 
the whiteboard experiments — this 
time, a bathroom stall — and a Geisel 
Library mascot.

AVP College Affairs and Speaker 
James Lintern offered up his speaker 
position for a week due to previ-
ous engagements. Councilmembers 
eagerly sprang for the opportunity to 

chair the Week 
Eight meeting.

Campuswide 
Senator Katie 
Hall urged coun-
cilmembers to 
participate in the 
search for a new 

senior vice chancellor of academic 
affairs who will advocate the preserva-
tion of social-sciences and humanities 
majors and programs on this campus. 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake, who currently 
holds the position, will retire at the 
end of the 2009-10 academic year.

After various retroactive excusals 
of absences from previous meet-
ings, councilmembers debated the 
language of the transportation ref-
erendum yet again, and concluded 
their relatively short discussion with a 
failed vote.

VP Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch submitted a proposed $5,000 
underwrite for the production of 
the Muir Musical, which the council 
passed. 

Muir College Senator Ryan 
O’Rear asked councilmembers how 
they would feel about former Muir 
College dining hall Sierra Summit — 
currently being revamped, and set to 
open in May 2010 — being renamed 
Timbers.

Councilmembers voiced their 
dissent, and O’Rear concluded that 
he would try to change the proposed 
name.

After conducting imaging studies 
of the brain, scientists at the UCSD 
School of Medicine have discovered 
a neurological cause of anorexia that 
could lead to more effective treat-
ment in the future.

The experiment began when 
scientists noticed that anorexia and 
bulimia tended to be passed down 
through family members. This indi-
cated a genetic cause behind eating 
disorders and motivated Dr. Walter 
Kaye and his research team to begin 
searching the brain for an explana-
tion.

They began their tests in the area 
of the brain called the insula which 
regulates interoceptive awareness, 
or the way your body responds to 
internal changes like a lack of food or 
oxygen.

Using functional magnetic 
resonance imagine (MRI), Scientists 
began testing the neurological 
reactions recovering anorexia 
patients to the taste of sugar. 
This machine enabled them to 
view changes in blood flow in 
the brain that occur as a result 
of neural activity.

In someone without an 
eating disorder, the insula 
releases hormones for plea-
sure when presented with the 
taste of sugar, especially after 
a long period of hunger. 

However, anorexic indi-
viduals did not react as 
strongly to the taste of sugar, 
indicating a problem in the 
part of the brain that conveys 
rewards or emotions.

“So if you feel pain, or 
you hold your breath, then 
there’s dramatic change of 

internal body states,” Kaye said. 
“[The insula] lights up and gives you 
a message saying ‘Yeah, okay, some-
thing’s changed, something’s wrong.’ 
[Anorexic patients] have an altered 
sense of self-awareness.”

By decreasing the amount of posi-
tive feedback the body gets from food 
and genetically enabling an individual 
to resist food for long periods of time, 
scientists concluded that a deficiency 
in this area of the brain can predis-
pose someone toward anorexia.

This deficiency in the function 
of the insula occurs as a result of an 
imbalance in the levels serotonin and 
dopamine. 

Dopamine is the hormone that 
gives a sensation of pleasure when 
your brain is exposed to food, sex, or 
drugs. Serotonin effects aggression 
and anxiety levels, especially in social 
situations.

According to Kaye, not only do 
those with anorexia not receive the 

heightened sensations of pleasure 
when exposed to food, but anorexics 
also experience an increase in sero-
tonin levels — as frequently happens 
when one consumes carbohydrates — 
which can actually lead to increased 
anxiety when someone eats.

Researchers also found that 
these problems in introspective 
awareness manifest at a young age. 
Adults or teenagers with anorexia 
often exhibit childhood signs of 
anxiety, perfectionism, obsessive 
compulsive disorder or difficulty 
changing mindsets.

Researchers are hoping to trans-
form these findings into new treat-
ments for anorexia and bulimia 
patients, or develop an early warning 
system.

Kaye predicts the project will con-
tinue for another five years.

“We’re working on finding the 
gene responsible for these, but we 
have a long way to go,” Kaye said.

Anorexia is currently the psycho-
logical disorder with the highest 

mortality rate, and those suf-
fering from it are more likely 

to encounter other mental 
disorders like severe depres-

sion and OCD. Today, and 
treatment methods rely 
heavily on various forms of 
psychotherapy, such as fam-
ily therapy.

The UCSD Eating 
Disorders Program will 

sponsor Eating Disorders 
Awareness Week, which 
takes place the last week in 
February and kicks off with 
a walk at Mission Bay at 10 
a.m. on Feb. 21.

It’s true: Desperate times call for desperate measures. That’s why, next year, we’ll be paying more for a cheap-ened education, and why we won’t be able to cram at 
Geisel past midnight to make up for it. 

But the latest desperate proposal from the Committee 
on Admissions doesn’t involve sacrificing a seat in lecture, 
nor a late-night study session — in fact, it could possibly 
soften some of the cutbacks. 

Though committee member and Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions Mae Brown is tight-lipped about the idea 
(which is still in its early stages), there’s word from A.S. 
Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund, who also serves on 
the committee, that the pipeline proposal would ease up on 
admissions qualifications for out-of-state students as a way 
to boost tuition intake. 

We know that the purpose of the UC system has always 
been, first and foremost, to provide an affordable, world-

class education to California residents, 
but this has the possibility — if operating 
under strict regulation — to do more help 
than hurt. If letting in a few more nonresi-
dents can put even the slightest dent in our 
campus’s estimated $80-billion deficit, this 
board thinks it’s at least worth testing out 

for a year — with a few stipulations.
Most importantly, we don’t support admitting more 

nonresidents if it means further reduction of in-state 
enrollment. This fall, the university already had to slice 
freshman enrollment by 2,300 students — and more cuts 
are in the cards for 2010-11. (Granted, if the UC Office of 
the President is true to its word, the damage won’t be quite 
as severe as last year’s — though we’ll believe that when we 
finally get off the waitlist next Fall Quarter). 

Gaping deficit or not, the university is still a state insti-
tution — one that can’t justify shutting out in-state appli-
cants just to turn a profit. Resident applicants are on the 
rise — especially transfer students, whose applications are 
up 17 percent over last year. The spare change we’d collect 
from more out-of-staters (who pay an estimated $21,191 
in tuition alone this year) means nothing if we’re letting in 
fewer residents, seeing as their education is the entire rea-
son for the university’s existence in the first place.

We also have to recognize that the committee might 
be spending time on a plan that could make an almost 
insignificant difference. Currently, the admissions depart-

The people at Banana Republic hate me. Not in an obvious way. They don’t throw things 
at me when I walk into the store or 
call me names to my face or tell me 
to “piss off ” when I ask them ques-
tions. It’s not Wal-Mart, after all. 

No, the impeccably dressed 
employees of America’s favorite 
overpriced khaki retailer express 
their disdain in much more subtle 
ways. Discerning looks, disapprov-
ing stares, gingerly upturned eye-
brows and long, drawn-out sighs. 
Sophisticated ways, you might say. 
Sophisticated like pairing an argyle 
sweater with thick-rimmed eyeglass-
es or having a job that requires you 
to wear a name tag. 

The sophisticated hatred of these 
sophisticated sophisticates wasn’t 
always so forthcoming, though. It 
only started last week, when, after 
realizing that I’d been wearing the 
same pair of jeans every day for 
two years, I decided to update my 
wardrobe. In retrospect, this was a 
terrible idea, but I’ve been in a weird 
slump with the ladies the past few 
weeks and I thought a new button-
down might help. I just had to figure 
out what a button-down was. 

Unfortunately, it wasn’t going to 
be as easy as strolling into a store 
and picking out a couple of new 
shirts. Unlike most Americans my 
age, I am morbidly afraid of shop-
ping. Researchers claim that my 
demographic — the aimless, oft-
drunk college student with too many 
credit cards — is a prime target for 
market-savvy retailers looking to sell 
worthless crap at ridiculous prices. 
If that’s true, then I’m the exception 
to the rule — particularly when it 
comes to dressing myself. There’s just 
something about clothing stores that 
makes me nervous. I get anxious. My 
head spins. I start to sweat. I stumble 
around and babble incoherently. I 
exaggerate a lot. 

This time would be different, 
though. This time I had a plan. This 
time, I decided, I would directly 
emulate someone else’s style, sav-
ing myself the agony of trying to 
define my own look. After a brief 
Google search involving such key-
words as “pants,” “shirts” and “how 
to look good in pants and shirts” I 
landed on a GQ article lauding the 
messianic fashion sense of recently 
deceased salad enthusiast Paul 
Newman. Apparently, in addition to 
manufacturing one hell of a balsamic 
vinaigrette, Newman was also the 
shit — cool, calm, collected; an icon. 
He made ill-fitting cotton sweatshirts 
look good. He wore dirty leather 
boots. He rode motorcycles. He rode 
motorcycles. 

This was it. I would dress like 
Paul Newman.

I soon found myself standing 
timidly in the doorway of Banana 
Republic, my eyes blinking rapidly as 
they adjusted to the vague, noncom-
mittal shades of beige that surrounded 
me. This was yuppie territory — a 
dangerous urban backcountry where 
people wear scarves indoors and

WEB POLL 
Do you think 
UCSD should 
accept more 
out-of-state 
applicants?

ZACHARY WATSON/GUARDIAN



OPINION� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

ment is only slightly stingier with its 
“Congratulations” letters to out-of-
state applicants than their in-state 
counterparts anyway. This year, the 
33-percent acceptance rate for out-
of-state applicants was only 4 percent 
lower than it was for California resi-
dents. In addition, based on numbers 
from the last few years, Haglund 
estimated that only about 13 percent 
of out-of-state students admitted 
next fall will even choose to come 
here — as opposed to 21.5 percent of 
residents. Then there’s the reality that 
as fees rise and class sizes swell, our 
sunny Triton banner might not look 
quite as attractive outside state limits 
anymore. 

But there’s nothing to lose, as 
long as in-state enrollment isn’t cut 
more than it already would have 
been. More out-of-staters could 
certainly have visible effects in our 
already-stuffed lecture halls and dorm 
rooms. While Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality Services may have an 
impressive track record for squeezing 
three bunks into dorms intended for 
two, increasing the proportion of out-
of-state students could prove hazard-
ous with our limited housing options. 
Their extra fees would have to be 
funneled specifically toward making 
extra space, physically and academi-
cally. Less stringent major require-
ments could ensure that no one gets 
squeezed out of the system.

The reason for enrollment slashes 
in the first place is inadequate state 
funding, so hosting a few more non-
Californians — who don’t use a dime 
of taxpayers’ money — wouldn’t be 
any strain on the pool of state funds. 

These concerns are less urgent 
than they are ideological. As it stands, 
only 679 of our 23,000-strong student 
body (a scant 3 percent) aren’t from 
the Golden State — outnumbered 
even by our 974 foreign exchange 
students. Even if the admissions 
department does make this proposal 
a reality, we certainly can’t count on a 
fresh crop of out-of-staters to be our 
sole saving grace — but until the bud-
get’s back on stable footing, there’s no 
harm in trying.

 
Dear Editor,

The disabled John Milton (he was 
blind when he wrote Paradise Lost) 
wrote, “A good book is the life blood 
of a master spirit.” Yet Vice Provost for 
Academic Planning Dan Greenstein 
said, “A book is now a body of infor-
mation that can be presented many 
different ways.” 

I bought 60 books at 
Wahrenbrock’s downtown bookstore 
last weekend because Chuck Valverde 
died. But the store’s doors will close 
forever next weekend, as the book 
market is becoming increasingly 
technology-driven. 

UC Press Associate Director for 
Development Erin Marietta said, 
“The press’s reaction to the current 
business climate includes plans to pro-
vide more digitalized books, expand 
its production of multimedia and 
continue to utilize online resources 
such as Facebook, Twitter, blogs and 
e-newsletters.”

But where do you turn when a 
photo-sharing Web site closes unex-
pectedly and with it go your pic-
tures? A recent attempt by Facebook 
to change the terms of use for all users 
by shifting ownership of all content on 
Facebook to the company — with no 
warning and no recourse — offers an 
example of the risks associated with 
moving data or to cloud providers.

Garcia Lorca was “a master spirit.” 
In addition to being a painter and a 
poet, he was a cineaste, a pianist, an 
arranger of traditional Andalician 
song harmonies. He and his troupe, 
La Barraca, popularized plays by 
Lope de Vega among the Chilean and 
Spanish masses. Between 1929 and 
1935, Garcia Lorca went on a tour 
similar to that of the Rolling Stones 
(my generation) or the Counting 

Crows (your generation) — only it 
was a book tour throughout Europe 
and the United States, Mexico, 
Canada, Cuba and Argentina. But 
in August 1936, when the Fascists 
entered Granada (Garcia Lorca was 
born in Fuente Vaueiros, Granada, 
Spain in 1899), they found him there 
and shot him. 

They also burned his books in the 
Plaza del Carmen.

It’s happening here today, too. The 
librarian has already limited access 
to the computers in the humanities 
division of Geisel Library. Moreover, 
bookmark-sized materials distributed 
by the librarian emphasize the county-
wide consortium — including UCSD 
and San Diego State — that has drasti-
cally reduced public access in recent 
weeks, making it look as if Microsoft 
was behind the no-freebies-for-the-
public policy change. Obviously, the 
students forced out because they can’t 
meet graduation requirements or lack 
resources will become “alumni,” but 
that doesn’t mean they’ll be ineligible 
for Personal Identification Numbers.

When I asked the Geisel Library 
newspaper room supervisor why pub-
lic access had been restricted to just 
three computers, she said Microsoft 
was in charge. It is the vendors’ call 
from here on in, according to the US 
Supreme Court.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2010� OPINION

where a man’s worth is measured by 
the thickness of his cashmere sweater. 
I’d have to be on my game here. I’d 
have to watch my back.

I walked inside and picked up 
a catalog. A quick scan of its con-
tents revealed that the ideal Banana 
Republic customer is young, racially 
ambiguous and prone to such activities 
as walking little terrier dogs on foggy 
beaches, staring serenely out of win-
dows and sitting in mahogany chairs. 

Never having done any of these 
things, I was already feeling discour-
aged. My palms were sweaty. My leg 
was shaking. But I had a goal. I was 
going to dress like Paul Newman. 
“Pull yourself together, man,” I whis-
pered through clenched teeth. “You 
can do this.”

“Are you finding everything 
alright?”

I turned around to see a short 
brunette in a wool sweater staring at 
me with raised eyebrows. She said her 
name was Kristen. Kristen the sales 
associate. 

“No, just Kristen,” she said. 
Excusing her insolence, I told 

her I was trying to look like Paul 
Newman. 

“The guy from the salad dressing,” 
I explained. 

“You know he was also an actor, 
right?” 

Strike two, Kristen. But what she 
lacked in sense of humor she made 
up for in sense of urgency. Wasting 
no time, she scooped up a small pile 
of clothing and led me to a row of 
fitting rooms, where she instructed 
me to try on a brown cardigan and a 
V-neck T-shirt that prominently dis-
played my complete lack of chest hair. 

Despite her best efforts, the 
ensemble made me look nothing like 
Paul Newman. I just looked like a guy 
who shopped at Banana Republic a 

lot. Kristen agreed. After seeing how 
awkward I look in a cardigan, she 
suggested I try on something called 
chinos, which, it turns out, are basi-

cally just 
pants. 

“They fit 
all wrong,” I 
told Kristen. 
“I could 
never ride a 
motorcycle in 
these.”

I was 
starting to get 
desperate. She 

was starting to get impatient. I decided 
to take matters into my own hands. 

“If I were to roll up my sleeves and 
put on a tighter pair of chinos and 
wear this belt, would I look like Paul 
Newman?”

“No.”
“What if I put on this hat?”
“No.”
“What if I put on this other hat?”
She walked away after that, but 

I got the feeling she was strangely 
attracted to me. Maybe Kristen and I 
had a future together. Maybe I’d move 
in with her and we’d buy a couple of 
mahogany chairs. Maybe we’d have a 
little terrier dog and stare out of win-
dows and wear scarves a lot.

As I left the store, defeated, I 
noticed a group of employees watch-
ing me intently, their well-sculpted 
eyebrows cocked at disapproving 
angles, their stylish, bespectacled 
faces narrowed in muted hatred. I 
understood immediately. In some 
strange, unspoken ritual, I had been 
banished from the shiny hardwood 
floors and cream-colored walls of 
Banana Republic, never to return. My 
experiment had backfired. I was still a 
terrible shopper. Kristen would never 
love me. Worst of all, I had failed to 
become Paul Newman.

NEWS� THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

dents support the referendum, Gupta 
said the results were skewed. 

“D’Autremont says that — based 
on answers from surveys that the 
transportation system adminis-
tered — students are in favor of the 
Transportation Referendum,” Gupta 
said. “However, if you read the survey 
carefully, it states that students want 
user fees instead of reductions, which 
is not what d’Autremont is offering.”

Gupta said he believes there are 
alternatives to running a student-fee 
referendum. 

“We’re being blackmailed into mak-
ing a decision which is not the most 
beneficial for students,” he continued. 
“There are other ways to find revenue 
than asking for money from students.”

Gupta created an A.S. com-
mittee to lobby at meetings of the 
Transportation Policy Committee 
— the committee that is asking 
d’Autremont to raise $3 million to 
maintain the current public-trans-
portation system. 

Transfer Senator Adam Powers is 
currently the only student representa-
tive on the TPC, and will be working 

with Gupta on the joint committee. 
The council also tabled voting on 

the Athletic Referendum until next 
week,. That referendum would renew 
a $12 quarterly Canyonview Pool fee 
set to expire in 2013, and increase the 
fee to $22. 

The council nonetheless approved 
a referendum to charter a Sports 
Facility Advisory Board, which would 
oversee the use of funds generated by 
the proposed Athletic Referendum.

Tritons for Israel President Dafna 
Barzilay said. “He has a lot to say, and 
he has ways of explaining the political 
conflicts to everyone in all spectrums 
of political beliefs.”

Oren also spoke at UC Irvine on 
Feb. 8, where protests grew so rau-
cous that they disrupted the event, 
resulting in the arrest of 
11 students.

Oren said he encour-
ages discussion and 
debate; however, he did 
not agree with the extent 
of the Irvine protests.

“Freedom of speech 
is a right cherished by 
Americans and Israelis 
alike, and safeguarded by 
our universities,” Oren 
said. “As Israel's ambassa-
dor, I am eager to engage 
all students in meaning-
ful dialogue, but we must 
resist attempts to bring 
Tehran to American cam-
puses.”

Barzilay said the Irvine 
arrests made her worried 
the Feb. 10 event would 
be disrupted as well; how-
ever, the protests outside 
Price Center Theater did 
not end in any arrests or major dis-
ruptions to the event inside.

The rally was primarily led 
by members of the Free Palestine 
Alliance and Act Now to Stop War 
and End Racism. Most of those who 
attended were adults, although there 
were several students present.

“The reason we're here today is 
that we all witnessed with horror and 
shock the war crimes that occurred to 
the people of Palestine last year,” Free 
Palestine Alliance San Diego Chapter 
member Mahmoud Ahmad said. 
“Michael Oren spent a lot of his time 
putting a positive image on a horrific 

tragedy we haven't ever seen before. 
We're shocked a university would 
invite him to speak here. That, in and 
of itself, should not be tolerated.”

Extra security was called to Price 
Center to ensure Oren's safety.

“He's an international figure and 
an ambassador,” Senior Public Events 
Manager of University Centers Tom 

Colley said. “It's our 
responsibility to main-
tain his life.”

Event planners 
employed security 
officers from UCSD, 
San Diego State 
University and the State 
Department, according 
to Colley. Attendees's 
belongings were checked 
upon entrance and all 
audience members were 
required to pass through 
a metal detector.

“We knew what to 
expect,” Colley said. 
“We began inspect-
ing the area at seven 
in the morning. Every 
trash can was emp-
tied. Every area was 
checked. Everything was 
cleansed, and then we 
waited.” 

During a public questioning peri-
od after Oren's speech, about a dozen 
attendees posed questions for the 
ambassador. Marshall College Senior 
Yuki Murakami inquired about 
Israel's treatment of Palestine.

“You mentioned a prisoner of 
war of the [Israeli Defense Force],” 
Murakami said. “There are over 
10,000 Palestinian, including the 
children and the elderly, that are 
held by Israel as political prisoners. 
According to Amnesty International, 
Israel is the only country in the world 
to legalize the use of children. When 
will the torture end, and will these 

prisoners be free?”
Oren responded by stating that 

Israel has higher torture restrictions 
than the U.S. and numerous European 
countries. He argued that in actuality, 
they look to Israel as a model.

Students for Justice in Palestine, 
a UCSD student organization, was 
not involved in organizing the rally. 
However, they did issue a statement 
of condemnation, and a number of 
SJP members asked questions at the 
event.

“We encourage open dialogue and 
discussion,” Students for Justice in 
Palestine Media Relations Director 
Leena Barakat said. “We did take 
advantage of the question-and-
answer section, and we did our best to 
keep it as civil and respectful as pos-
sible. However, they had cut our mics 
off for some questions, and did not 
allow us followup questions, which 
could be a free-speech issue. But he 
was here to speak and not debate, and 
we respect that.”

Barzilay said she was happy stu-
dents posed difficult questions for 
the ambassador, because it stimulated 
discussion.

“I'm really, really appreciative of 
the students from the other end of the 
political spectrum who came in and 
were respectful and asked questions,” 
Barzilay said.

At the end of the event, Oren 
thanked audience members for their 
attendance and participation.

“I've really enjoyed this tonight,” 
Oren said. “I come to campuses to 
hear the types of questions I've heard 
today. It's important that I listen to 
you, just like you listen to me. The 
respect for freedom of speech is 
extremely important, and I'm grateful 
we had this discussion tonight — a 
civil discussion.”

funding out of the state is important,” 
Haglund said. “Switching to using 
the academic index score is one of 
the options being discussed.”

Vice Chancellor and Director of 
Admissions Mae Brown said UCSD 
first implemented its comprehensive 

review system in 
2002. The system 
awards different 
application factors 
— such as academ-
ics, work experi-
ence and leader-
ship — certain 
numerical scores. 

The total pos-
sible points add up 
to 11,100 points, 
and 7,624 points 
is the minimum 
number UCSD 
requires to be 
admitted. 

Under the 
holistic review sys-

tem — used by UCLA and UC 
Berkeley — applicants are given a 
single score based on a more subjec-
tive evaluation of their applications. 

The AI score includes only aca-
demic components — such as GPA 
and test scores — in evaluating 
applicants.

According to Brown, prior to 
2002, AI and comprehensive review 
were used independently of one 
another at UCSD. The top 50 per-
cent of applicants were admitted 
solely because they met the thresh-
old of an AI score, whereas the 
remainder of the admitted appli-
cants were evaluated using the com-
prehensive review system.

According to Haglund, universi-
ties such as Berkeley and UCLA 
attract more out-of-state students — 
and their higher out-of-state fees — 
by using the holistic review system. 

“Berkeley currently has a 
monopoly on out-of-state students,” 
he said. 

Haglund said that because holis-
tic review is less clear-cut than the 
comprehensive review system, it 
allows more leeway.

His data shows that 6,480 more 
applicants would be eligible for 
admission under a strictly AI score 
than the current system.

Currently, 97 percent of UCSD 
undergraduates are resident stu-
dents. In Fall 2008, UCSD admitted 
1,943 of 5,933 nonresident appli-
cants, with an admit rate of 32 per-
cent. Based on these numbers, the 
university expects 13.1 percent of 
admitted nonresident applicants to 
enroll. 

Brown said that these numbers 
are being used by the Committee on 
Admissions for analysis.

“There’s absolutely no proposal 
to go back to the way we used to do 
admissions,” she said. 

Brown said that since 2002, the 
same comprehensive review system 
has been used for both resident and 
nonresident students. 

“The only difference is that the 
minimum GPA is 3.0 for nonresi-
dents, while it is 3.4 for residents,” 
said Brown. “This will continue to 
be the case.”

Brown said that even if the idea 
was implemented, it would not 
necessarily affect admissions for 
California applicants, due to an in-
state quota that must be filled. 

“The UC system set a target for 
California residents that we have to 
reach,” she said.

 Haglund said that, though a 
proposal has not been drafted, the 
committee should submit the idea 
to the university’s Academic Senate. 

“This is something students 
should be talking about, because 
faculty definitely are,” he said.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2010 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/HIATUS8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

I f this isn’t the devil’s music, I don’t know what is. Massive Attack 
is back, and their first 
album in seven years goes 
as deep and dark as we 
could hope from Bristol’s 
broodiest duo. 

Their latest is crepus-
cular music at its best 
— dark, melancholic and 
lurking, but never one-
note or overbearing in its 
sadness. It’s a canvas of 
effects that ring like a trip 
through Dante’s Inferno 
or the theme to the fall of 
Lucifer. 

Album highlight 
“Splitting the Atom” is 
one especially swirly 
mess of hell, narrated by 
freakishly talented devil 
imposter Horace Andy. 
The gravelly voicebox tells 
a macabre story —about 
a baby who chokes the 
same evening it’s born — 

then continues to touch 
on honey scars, burning 
suns and vertigo. The 
heady electronic beat, 
punctuated by a regular 
sharp screech in place of a 
drum thump and a back-
ing chorus whispering 
incomprehensibles, ups 
the creepy shreshold.

If “Splitting the Atom” 
is the story of evil tempta-
tion, “Psyche” — featur-
ing trip-hopper Martina 
Topley-Bird — is a narra-
tive of the long way down. 
Filled with metaphors 
about falling and rumi-
nations about the moral 
decay of the soul, Topley-
Bird sings plaintively over 
odd, reverberating guitar 
warbles that slide up and 

down the scale — mim-
icking the chills up our 
spines — and builds to an 
emphatic chorus about 
taking the plunge. 

“Rush Minute,” fea-
turing founding Attack 
member Robert del Naja, 
grumpily breaks the 
gloom with monotone 
vocals that get inanely

HATETHISFILM

F or his directorial debut, Hue Rhodes should have left Dante’s Inferno alone. 
A modern-day interpretation 
of the literary classic, “Saint 
John of Las Vegas” milks the 
connection between Sin City 
and damnation, but emerges 
with nothing more than a 
weak premise and even flim-
sier characters.

In the original, Dante 
Alighieri, guided by the 
Roman poet Virgil, tours 
hell in an allegory for the 
recognition and rejection 
of sin; in “Vegas,” John 
Alighieri (Steve Buscemi) 
is an ex-gambler who still 
compulsively buys lotto 
scratchers, and with partner 
Virgil (Romany Malco) he’s 
investigating an insurance 
claim in Las Vegas — involv-
ing a stripper named Tasty 
D. Light, of course.

However profound 
the groundwork, the film 
lurches through the desert 
without social commentary 
or humor, and the bizarre 
characters try to compensate 
by overacting. Alighieri’s 
boss (Peter Dinklage) is a 
midget, and his girlfriend 
(Sarah Silverman) is terrify-
ingly obsessed with yellow 
smiley faces, but their forced 
quirkiness only makes for an 
uncomfortable theaterful.

Lost in the Nevada waste-
land, it’s hard to tell what 
exactly Alighieri is struggling 
with (besides tumbleweeds). 
Theoretically, a personal 
transformation turns him 
away from sin at some point, 
but Steve Buscemi’s acting 
can’t quite show it; his only 
sign of growth is a cocky 
dance at a truck stop. 

Even with an ominous 
score to set the tone, “Vegas” 
fails to get off the ground, 
and even the film’s climax 
is buried under sideshows. 
Save $10 and watch the 
seven deadly sins flash atop 
the Warren College engi-
neering building — it’s a 
quicker, less painful version 
of this travesty.

W ashing wineglasses is almost impossible — they’re fragile, and the bulb shape doesn’t allow for sponging. Eventually, it’s too much trouble, so your man starts drinking wine in tumblers. 
Ladies, this cannot be tolerated! Stand up for elegance — get him 
something that won’t shatter in the dishwasher. Get him a man’s

N o, that’s not a euphemism for Ecstacy. Or roofies. Just a good-old-fashioned Willy Wonka trip: Take one miracle berry tablet and your taste buds will go topsy-turvy: Lemons will taste sugary, Tabasco sauce mild — the possibilities abound. Don’t bother trying to under-
stand the science; just be awed by the wonders of 21st century.

If you’re single, round up your closest cronies and hold a flavor-warping 
party to experience your buds like never before. And if you already have a 
Valentine to spice up your life, it gets even better. No need, this year, for a quiet 
night in — save them for when you eat out (if you know what I mean).

This year’s Valentine’s Day comes at the midpoint of what is consistently the most arduous quarter of the year: Spring break is still too far away to 
fathom, and unrelenting waves of midterms 
seem to coordinate themselves with rain. So 
this Feb. 14, help your lover de-stress with a 
massage from RIMAC Arena, courtesy of the 
rec. department’s Weightrooms & Wellness 
program. Less than $60 buys him or her an 
hour of bliss — which could very well make 
the difference between a warm, romantic end 
to your V-Day and an action-less night on a 
cold pillow.

Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I had no idea when you said “Let’s take a break” that you didn’t actually mean it. I swear when I 
woke up sur-
rounded by 
empty Dom 
Perignon bot-
tles and strip-
pers, your spar-
kling eyes were 
the first thing I 
thought of.

Speaking for myself and every other sports nut I know, there’s nothing sexier than a girl that’s into sports. So, as Valentine’s Day approaches 
— instead of being the only questionable/creepy 
guy in Victoria Secret, or burning a Benjamin 
Franklin-sized hole in your pocket at some 
jewelry store or expensive restaurant — give a 
gift that expresses your love in way you both can 
enjoy: the 2010 David Beckham calendar. Now 
she has eye candy during the shirtless months 
(which are most), and she’ll develop such a 
crush on Golden Balls that she’ll always let you 
watch the game at her house. Plus, you spend 
under 20 bucks — triple play!

L et’s consider a couple popular pieces of animation: “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Beavis and 
Butthead,” “Toy Story,” “South Park,” 
“Finding Nemo.” What do these films 
and TV shows have in common? Other 
than being embedded into our pop-
culture DNA, they’ve been named by 
critics as our generation’s best. Apart 
from popularity and acclaim, however, 
they also have a much more intrinsic 
link unnoticeable to the average eye: all 
of their animators started their careers at 
Spike and Mike’s Animation Festival. 

Founded in 1977 by Craig “Spike” 
Decker and Mike Gribble — UCSD 
alumni and the owners of Mellow 
Manor Productions — the festival origi-
nally promoted underground bands, 
holding film screenings (both classics 
and local work) after every show, and 
introducing them with animated shorts.

Over time, however, the shorts 
themselves became immensely popular, 
and developed their own cult following 
— outshining everything else in the pro-
cess. Spike and Mike realized they had 
tapped into an unexplored niche, and 
named the phenomenon Spike & Mike’s 
Classic Animation Festival. 

Today, the festival is a haven for 
aspiring animators and filmmakers. 
Venues for nouveau animators to strut 
their stuff didn’t used to exist; the festival 
opened a space for diehards and new-
bies to appreciate the art of animation.

Bigshots like Tim Burton and John 
Lasseter made their mark by premier-
ing their short films through Spike and 
Mike back in the ’80s. As the years went 
by, more and more ambitious filmmak-
ers competed to debut their films for 
the festival, and the genre positively 
exploded. It became more sophisti-
cated — even cruder. Hence, the birth 
of Spike & Mike’s Sick and Twisted 
Festival, which has become the pair’s 
most famous endeavor.

Showcased at Comic-Con every year, 
this influential festival is responsible 
for the birth of “Beavis and Butthead” 
and “South Park.” If you’ve come across 
a disturbing yet popular piece of ani-
mation floating around the ’nets (I’m 
looking at you, Happy Tree Friends), 
chances are it was debuted to the Sick 
and Twisted audience.

“Humor’s the bottom line,” Spike 
said. “A younger crowd can appreciate 
artistic merits to have good time. It’s 
very accessible, and a fun time to escape 
the reality of the frickin’ world.” 

Wherever the immature trend — 
childish fantasy, slapstick or crude and 
lewd — the influence of Spike and Mike 
is undeniable. Though Mike passed 
away in 1994, Spike has continued run-
ning the festival.

Three long years have passed since 
the last Spike & Mike festival was held in 
La Jolla — but this year, it’s back.

Hold your horses. This isn’t the Spike 
& Mike you’re familiar with. Instead of 
opting for the more traditional Sick and 
Twisted, this year Spike decided to gath-
er the best animated shorts worldwide in 
the past three years — regardless of sick-
ness — to show at the festival. Tamely 
titled New Generation Animation 
Festival and hosted by the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in downtown La 
Jolla, this year’s event will value artistic 
talent and technical savvy.

“This is very high-brow stuff. The 
analogy I like to use is, if [Sick and 
Twisted] was 40-oz. beer, then this is 
vintage cabaret wine,” Spike said.

The festival will play a compilation 
film, stringing all chosen shorts into 
one 90-minute extravaganza. It will be 
separated into three acts that highlight 
intellectual, technical and technological 
achievements. 

The first act opens with “Missed 
Aches,” a colorful parody on lan-

FILMREVIEW

By Neda Salamat
Staff Writer

A film that shoots for “Love Actually” and falls 11 months short, director Garry Marshall’s latest is a mess of flowers, chocolate, heart-
ache and migraine. Set in the 
not-so romantic city of Los 
Angeles, “Valentine’s Day” 
wanders from one cookie-
cutter character to the next, 
wrapping exhausted viewers 
in a web of indistinguishable 
plotlines too haphazard and 
sticky-sweet to follow.

The star-studded cast is 
lead by Ashton Kutcher and 
Jennifer Garner — the former playing a florist 
who just proposed to his girlfriend (Jessica 
Alba) and the latter an elementary school 
teacher dating a two-timing doctor (Patrick 
Dempsey).

Garner’s character, Julia Fitzpatrick — whose 
name you won’t remember — is invited to an 
anti-Valentine’s Day party by her friend (Jessica 
Biel), who works for a woman named Paula 
Thomas (Queen Latifah). Thomas’ company 
represents sports star Sean Jackson (Eric Dane), 

constantly being pestered by a sports newscaster 
(Jaime Foxx) for an interview.

Confused yet? There’s more.
Liz (Anne Hathaway) works as an assistant 

in aforementioned office — that is, when she’s 
not moonlighting as a phone-sex operator or 

schmoozing with her boy-
friend (Topher Grace). And 
even though those plots and 
people were probably enough 
to keep you puzzled for a 
week, the film also stars Julia 
Roberts and Bradley Cooper, 
whose characters spend the 
duration of the film flirting 
on an airplane. 

If you weren’t already 
vomiting “Exorcist”-style at the thought of this 
Hollywood circle-jerk, Marshall squeezes in some 
tween “Juno” romance to get the acids churning, 
guaranteed. Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins 
play the quintessential virginal couple hoping 
to do it for the first time, while Taylor Swift and 
Taylor Lautner bat eyelashes by the lockers.

Accepting a role alongside the rest of the A-list 
is usually a good move, but each actor suffers 
from severe lack of screen time in “Valentine’s 
Day,” making it impossible for any of the film’s 

talent to reach its full potential. It’s only during 
the romantic comedy’s closing outtakes that the 
cast is finally able to demonstrate the humorous 
geniality that was stifled by the schizophrenic 
plot.

With some heavy 
editing, a more selec-
tive casting director 
and fewer excruciating 
tales of the nightmares 
of dating, there may 
have been breathing 
room for sympathy 
— even enjoyment. 
Instead, we’re con-
stantly reminded that 
Hollywood has far 
too much money, and 
beauty, for its own 
good. 

And, although 
Kutcher and Garner’s 
charismatic personali-
ties make up for their 
short bursts of time on 

screen, the film’s cheesy premise, terrible dia-
logue and pretty-face overkill are sure to make 
this holiday bust a one-weekend wonder.

W e tried to forget the rap-rock-infested early 2000s, when Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach reigned supreme, but the Flobots shoved it 
back in our faces with 2008’s horrendous lyrical 
trap “Handlebars.” You’d think they’d have been 
relegated to one-hit wonder status, but for some 
reason, they’re still making music — and some-
one apparently still cares. New single “White Flag 
Warrior” isn’t nearly as annoying as their first 
hit, but it’s pretty damn close. With the help of 
Rise Against lead singer Tim McIlrath, Flobots 
attempt to mimic Rage Against the Machine’s 
political schtick, only instead of Tom Morello’s 
innovative guitar solos and radical riots, we get 
an endless cliche of thumping bass and … rap? 
Great job, Flobots. You’ve really outdone yourself.

— Arielle Sallai 
Staff Writer

L ooks like the Barenaked Ladies survived the departure of founder/frontman Stephen Page. At least, that’s the impression we get from 
listening to “You Run Away,” the rock ballad 
memorializing the band’s mature but regretful 
resignation.

Former guitarist Ed Robertson takes on full 
vocal duties, having cut his teeth singing many of 
BNL’s biggest hits (he improvised the rapid-�re 
verses in “One Week”), and his smooth tenor 
successfully carries a gentle melody while a piano 
plinks quirkily in the background. Granted, the 
song’s subsequent buildup is a bit too FM radio, 
but its honesty is impossible not to take seriously. 
As the album approaches, one hopes the rest will 
be equally genuine.

“Sluttiest Outfit” contest. (MP)

Hot Chip
One Life Stand
EMI RECORDS

H ot Chip is a nerdy British electro-pop band with a penchant 
for synthesizers and irony. 
Susan Boyle is a middle-
aged Scottish woman with 
an astonishing voice. Apart 
from average appearances, 
these two don’t have much 
of a connection, except 
that Boyle — that frumpy 
nobody from Blackburn — 
is Hot Chip’s muse. Well, 
kind of.

On their new album One 
Life Stand, frontman Joe 
Goddard said he wrote high-
light “Keep Quiet” directly 
after watching Boyle’s per-
formance of “I Dreamed a 
Dream” on “Britain’s Got 
Talent.”

That’s not to say that the 
album includes music from 
“Les Miserables;” Boyle’s 
influence isn’t that obvious. 
But she has helped Hot Chip 
soften up a bit. 

“Keep Quiet” is quite the 
departure from the band’s 
most recognizable song, 
“Ready for the Floor.”Gone 
are the days of tongue-in-
cheek, club-ready dance 
grooves. Make way for soft 
melodies and heartfelt lyrics. 
Hot Chip strikes a delicate 

balance here: Even in its 
most rhythmical moments, 
its lyrics are actually rather 
romantic. Susan Boyle’s exis-
tence has pushed Hot Chip 
out of its Devo-like tenden-
cies into a New Order revo-
lution somehow. 

The rest of the album 
follows suit. The excellent 
titular track tries out a bit of 
disco while spouting lyrics 
usually reserved for singer-
songwriters with acoustic 
guitars. Singer Alexis Taylor 
croons, “I only want to be 
your one life stand/ Tell me 
do you stand by your man.” 

However, Hot Chip’s 
newfound seriousness is not 
always welcome. The quietest 
song on the album, “Slush,” 
is just plain boring. It’s cool 
that Hot Chip is expanding 
its sound, but it shouldn’t 
chuck its trademark com-
pletely. 

Nonetheless, the album 
just might be its best yet 
— though it would have 
benefitted from a more obvi-
ous throwback to the days 
of yore. “Hot Chip Does the 
Classics” would have been 
pretty damn entertaining.

Yeasayer
Odd Blood
SECRETLY CANADIAN

R eady for the overpro-duced cheese-pop colossus of 2010? 
Brooklyn’s Yeasayer spent 
months laboring on it in 
an upstate New York cabin 
with piles of tricked-out 
equipment. They culled 
sounds in both the bathtub 
and basement to reach 
holy-grail tones all in the 
name of crafting an unholy 
songwriting mess. Odd 
Blood soaks up the dregs of 
Scissor Sisters — that Pure 
Moods comp with Enya 
that my Mom rocked on 
cassette every day — and 
’90s shit-techno. 

Our irony-blind trio 
debuted back in 2007 with 
the mildly intriguing All 
Hour Cymbals, which pil-
laged Animal Collective 
indie concepts and blended 
them with Barnes and 
Noble’s World Music sec-
tion in a messy organic 
smoothie. Now they veer 
into Love Jamz infomercial 
tactics with huge, reverber-
ating choruses in a futile 
attempt to beat the cool-
curve by naming the next 
big thing: bargain bin.

Any terrible genre 
you can imagine is gor-

geously captured on this 
LP: “I Remember” is the 
unforgettable synth ballad, 
“ONE” has faux-Afro beats 
and falsetto squeals galore 
and “Love Me Girl” hurls 
Backstreet Boys melodies 
into the mix. How did 
this threesome not real-
ize how far they’d fallen 
by idolizing Phil Collins’ 
yuppiedouche touch? I’m 
waiting for Kenny G and 
Chaka Khan guest spots 
on Album Three — if they 
were gonna go all out, they 
should’ve brought in the 
big guns.

Yes, lead single 
“Ambling Alp” saves these 
hipster victims by revel-
ing in its big-beat cheese, 
and the gooey hook “Stick 
up for yourself son/ Never 
mind what anybody else 
done,” but it’s one of a 
few redeeming tracks 
where you can overlook 
trash-taste for genuine 
song craft. The rest of 
Odd Blood is so musically 
confused it needs a cold 
shower and a few weeks’ 
rehab from Pitchfork’s 
tastemakers.

The Soft Pack
The Soft Pack
KEMADO RECORDS

A fter being drowned in flack for their controversial name, the band formerly known as 
the Muslims finally gave up and 
got a makeover. Under new alias, 
the Soft Pack are debuting their 
first full-length as the only San 
Diego natives to play at Coachella 
— not too shabby for Torrey 
Pines High School alums who 
used to deliver pizza in Del Mar. 

The self-titled album mimics 
three-minute classics popular in 
the ’60s, concise taste-testers of 
the band’s stylized garage-punk. 
Trading in overtly thrashy power 
chords for eye-roll melodies, the 
Pack give an aggressive nod to 
surf and punk-rock with enough 
angst to kill a small animal.

First single “C’mon” is a 
speedy strum-and-bass rush, 
Matt Lamkin pumping mono-
tone don’t-give-a-fuck vocals 

(“Don’t have a look/ Don’t have 
the name/ Don’t have the walk/ 
Don’t want to talk”) to challenge 
the cuddly new band name.

“More or Less” shows off their 
SoCal surf-rock influence while 
criticizing the La Jolla lifestyle of 
the rich and selfish, complete with 
Beach Boy vocals and a stoney 
instrumental jam to end the song.

Dangerously similar to their 
beach-fried genre predecessors, 
the Soft Pack isn’t pushing any 
limits here. But they also avoid 
cloning their peers with low-fi 
blare, and remind us why we 
love unpolished garage crap. 
Their tardy entrance doesn’t 
condemn them outdated or 
unoriginal — rather, a fresh take 
on the well-studied, well-worn 
music we call surf-punk.

guage and diction, unveiling the illusion-of-
intelligence theme with slick animated pacing. 
Then, we move to the multiple-award-win-
ning “Lapsus” by Gabriel Alfonzo, which plays 
with shape and structure while still somehow 
commenting the power of religion and faith 
(or lack thereof). Drawing out this sociopoliti-
cal motif is “Stillwaters” — a claymation con-
templation on trust — and “Crab Revolution,” 
a hand-drawn reflection on the frivolity of life.

The second act is a technical feast, high-
lighting some of today’s finest hand-drawn, 
two-dimensional cel animation — “Santa the 
Fascist Years” at the top of the list. “Key Lime 
Pie” is a masterstroke in character design, 
and “The Hidden Life of the Burrowing Owl” 
mixes cel with documentary reel footage and 
slapstick. “Quiet Log Time,” animated by 
fan-favorite Dr. Tran, is a brilliant study in 
punchline pacing, while “Yulia” is a beautifully 
sketched ballet set to a smalltime love story.

The festival, however, saves its best for 
last: The third act is riddled with technologi-
cal breakthroughs. It begins with “Eleven 
Roses,” a dark tale of unrequited love that 
cleverly shifts between 2D and 3D animation 
to fit the film’s changes in mood. It’s followed 
by brilliant stop-motion shorts “Western 
Spaghetti” and “A Town Called Panic: Cake,” 
astoundingly clever in their playful combina-
tion of toys with the mechanics of animation. 

But they’re all topped by “For Sock’s 
Sake,” which also uses stop-motion anima-
tion, but combines it with 2D mechanics and 
sub-cultural geek memes to craft a piece of 
astounding depth.

Closers “Ghost of Stephen Foster” and 
“Oktapodi” hold the festival together, exem-
plifying contemporary breakthrough. “Ghost” 
acts as a parody on the classic ’30s “Betty 
Boop” style while imparting dense subliminal 
satire in its crevices of crude humor, and 
“Oktapodi” utilizes Pixar-influenced charac-
ter design to tell similar slapstick.

“It’s so fresh, so innovative — we try to 
keep it alive each year,” Spike said. “These 
submissions are new ideas from new people. 
It keeps new cultures alive and fresh, not like 
trendy music. Animation brings things to life. 
It’s not like selling pizza; it’s more like creating 
new genres of music.”

▶ FESTIVAL, fromÊpageÊ9
From Sick to Smart

I t’s true: Serenading your beloved on acoustic guitar (with what-ever sickly ballad tickles your fancy) takes the prize for sap-
piest gift — but there’s also no surer 
bet for a little Valentine’s action. While 
following John Mayer’s lead might seem 
kind of transparent, trust me: She won’t 
know the difference until it’s too late. 

D.I.Y. CANDY
BY KELSEY MARRUJO • COPY EDITOR

L or all those lucky enough to have a Valentine on the imminent day of depression and sadness (no bitterness here), do the world a favor and don’t be so predictable. If his favorite candy is Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, don’t buy him that crap in the holiday-
themed pink packaging. Instead, show him you really care by Googling 
the sweets from scratch. Abridged version: Buy some chocolate chips, melt 
them and leave them to cool in the fridge in individual mini mu�n liners. 

Once hardened, spread some peanut 
butter (not the organic kind) on each 
of the pieces, then go ahead and repeat 
step one for the top layer. �e end 
product may not look as pretty as the 
CVS fare, but it’ll be just as bomb.

CHIVALROUS
SERENADE
BY TREVOR COX • OPINION EDITOR

L ooking to get your honey-bunches-of-oats something a little 
more substantial than sweet 
nothings this Valentine’s? You 
can’t get much more concrete 
than land. Moon land. 
�anks to www.lunarland.
com — “Earth’s oldest, most 
recognized celestial real 
estate agency” — you too 
could call one lunar acre of 
God’s thumbnail your own. 
For only $29.99, the cheese to 
your macaroni will get a legal 
document listing the location 
of the land, the lunar bill of 
rights and a map showing 
quadrant, lot number, 
latitude and longitude. So 
return that box of See’s 
Candies and transcend the 
name-a-star gig. Mars is also 
on the market.

HIATUS EDITOR

S ingle? Self-gift a collection of your favorite John Hughes. He couldn’t have blended life’s 
highlights better: pop soundtracks, 
high-school hijinks and chicken soup 
for the insecure soul in us all. The 
High-School Flashback Collection 
(“The Breakfast Club,” “Weird Science,” 
“Sixteen Candles”) is pure late-’80s 
Prozac — and if all else fails, you can 
always just take shots all evening.

ULTRAZONE — The Ultimate Laser Adventure

Leadoff hitter Saul was hit by a pitch, 
followed by a single from Junior 
catcher Michael Benton. Bauman, 
next to the plate, reached on a mis-
played sacrifice bunt, and redshirt 
freshman Danny Susdorf — a transfer 
from the University of San Diego — 
tied the game up 4-4 with an RBI sac-
rifice fly to center field to score Saul.

The inning ended exactly how it 
started, as Sedin was hit by a pitch, 
giving the Tritons the walk-off 5-4 
win. 

The second game featured a 
dominant pitching performance by 
junior right-hander Daniel Simmons. 
He hurled a complete game, tossing 
seven innings of one run ball while 

allowing just five hits and striking 
out eight Wolves. Benton hit a two-
run shot, providing all the offense 
necessary for the Tritons to win the 
game 6-1. 

The Tritons looked to com-
plete the four-game sweep at Triton 
Ballpark on Monday. An offensive 
explosion gave them an impressive 
19-5 win. Each of the batters in the 
Triton lineup had at least two hits 
apiece, and the lineup finished 22-38 
with a .539 batting average. 

Gregorich, Bauman� and Benton 
all homered in the game, as Gregorich 
led the attack, going 3-3 with five 
RBIs. Senior right-hander Kirby St. 
John earned the win, improving to 
1-1, tossing five innings, allowing five 

runs and striking out six.
Inspite of the emphatic series 

win, Rossman says the team is taking 
things one step at a time.

“We’ve got a talented group of 
guys that have been working hard 
since September,” he said. “The prep-
aration is there. Now we just need to 
concentrate on the task at hand, take 
everything one pitch at a time, and let 
our preparation take over.”

The Tritons take to the diamond 
again this Friday, when they will host 
Grand Canyon University in a dou-
ble-header at Triton Ballpark. First 
pitch is slotted for 11 a.m.�

Readers can contact Cameron Tillisch 
at ctillisc@ucsd.edu.

DANIEL CADDELL/GUARDIAN
In the last win of the series sweep over Western Oregon on Feb. 8, each UCSD hitter tallied at least two hits and finished with a .539 team batting average. 
Senior starting pitcher Kirby St. John pitched 5 innings to pick up the win, striking out six Wolf hitters. Three Triton hitters homered in the game.

Katie Belanger’s home run took 
her around the bases, giving UCSD a 
2-0 advantage. 

Senior starting pitcher Christine 
Zankich, who pitched a complete 
game and conceded only two earned 
runs, took the tough loss. 

Chico State fought back in the 
seventh inning, scoring the tying run 
on a two-out RBI single.

“Our defense loosened up after 
scoring two runs, but it was a mis-
take on our part,” Lesovsky said. 

The Wildcats scored the winning 
run on a RBI sacrifice fly in the top 
of the eighth inning, then held on 
for the narrow win after two UCSD 
hitters stranded Belanger in scoring 
position.

UCSD will have an opportunity 
to avenge its loss in a four-game 
series against Chico State on Feb. 12 
and Feb. 13. 

“Playing Chico State again, we’ll 
show them that the loss in the Best 
of the West Invitational was only a 
fluke,” Lesovsky said.

defense is akin to Swiss cheese.
Yet, for all these shortcomings, 

France still has one of the most elite 
talent hotbeds in world football — 
due in large part to their tendency 
to naturalize quality players from 
the country’s former colonies. In 
Girondins de Bordeaux midfielder 
Yoann Gourcuff, they have a creative 
midfielder to fill the hole left by 
the departed French icon Zinadine 
Zidane. With the likes of Frank 
Ribery, the explosive rocket-like 
Bayern Munich attacker, Real Madrid 
striker Karim Benzema, the resurrect-

ed Chelsea goal-getter Nicolas Anelka 
and the aforementioned Henry, 
Gourcuff has a wealth of options to 
send forward into attack.

On sheer tournament pedigree 
and raw talent, the French possess 
world-conquering potential. Potential 
that, in the very least, will see them 
top Group A.

My pick for runner up: Uruguay.
The two-time World Cup win-

ners enter this year’s edition as 
balanced and capable as any other 
squad in this tournament. Led in 
attack by the Spanish League leading 
scorer — Athletico Madrid striking 

extraordinaire Diego Forlan — and 
Ajax starlet Luis Suarez, the Charrúas 
La Celeste Olímpica (as their sup-
porters affectionately call them) have 
scorers accustomed to performing at 
the highest level. Also, the fact that 
Uruguay emerged out of a highly 
competitive South American field 
shows they can win important match-
es in tough conditions.

However, if they don’t maximize 
their potential, their impressive quali-
fication could be for naught — as an 
opportunistic Mexican side or a hun-
gry host nation will undoubtedly look 
to spoil the “sky-blue” dreams.

by coming back from those three 
bogeys with a chance on the last 
hole to break 70.”

 Okasaki and senior Raj Samra, 
in the first and second spots respec-
tively on the squad, played well 
over the first 36 holes, 
but struggled over the 
final 18. Both shot final-
round 79s after solid 
opening rounds on the 
first day. 

Wydra said the dis-
appointing final rounds 
were a testament to the 
conditioning that the 
sport requires.

“Golf is so much 
about flexibility,” Wydra 
said. “I think that after 
playing 36 holes in day 
one, your body gets sore 
and tired. It’s like run-
ning a half-marathon 
one day and going out 
for a five-mile run the 
next — your body is sore. That’s 
what happened to Keith and Raj. 
Their bodies weren’t doing a good 
job, and they were off because of 
that.”

Samra had another explanation.
“I didn’t get much sleep the night 

before the final round,” Samra said. 
“I was studying for a midterm that I 
had the following night.”

While a fifth-place finish might 
seem lackluster to an unknowing 
spectator, Wydra said the team did 
quote well, considering the compe-
tition.

“Redlands, who finished in 
fourth, competes annually for the 
Division-III national champion-
ship,” he said. “The top three are 
full-scholarship schools that are able 
to recruit in ways that we can’t.”

Okasaki echoed his coach’s com-

ments, adding that many competi-
tors came from schools with lower 
academic requirements.

“It’s a huge disadvantage for us, 
especially in this economy,” he said. 
“Players will go to schools that offer 
them financial help, instead of here. 

We have higher academ-
ic standards than a lot 
of these other schools, 
making it difficult to get 
recruits here.”

UCSD’s rigorous 
admission requirements 
have taken a toll on 
Triton recruiting.The 
golf team lost two poten-
tial players  this year 
because their SAT scores 
and GPA were below 
standard.

That reputation 
didn’t scare off blue-
chip recruit and trans-
fer Samra, who said 
that UCSD’s academic 
reputation — along with 

the opportunity to play so many 
courses — was exactly why chose 
to attend.

“[Wydra] was the only coach 
that came out to one of my commu-
nity-college tournaments,” he said. 
“I was going to go play at Sonoma 
State, which won the National 
Championship last year, but what 
really sold me was the opportunity 
to improve my golf game by playing 
so many courses.”

Next up for the Tritons is the 
St. Edwards Invitational in Austin, 
Texas on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23.

UCSD will host two qualifying 
rounds for the team over the next 
two weeks to determine who will 
travel to the event.

GOLFERS FIND RHYTHM WITH FIFTH-PLACE FINISH

SOFTBALL — Despite the rain, the 
Tritons opened their 2010 season at 
the Mizuno Best of the West invita-
tional in Turlock, Calif. on Feb. 5. 
They finished with a 1-1 record — 
winning against Central Washington 
University 2-0, but losing to Chico 
State 2-3.

The team fought a muddy field 
almost as hard as their first oppo-
nent. The Tritons started off on the 
offensive, scoring both of their runs 
in the first two innings, largely due 
to errors made by their opponents. 

Junior leadoff hitter Sarah 
Woofter was awarded first base after 
being hit by a pitch, and advanced to 
third on two Wildcat errors. Senior 
catcher  Nicole Saari then brought 
Woofter home by grounding into a 
fielder’s choice.

In the second inning, junior out-
fielder Lyndsay Gaylord took first 
base with a one-out single, stole sec-
ond and took third with the help 
from junior Katrin Gabriel’s sacrifice 

bunt. Then, thanks to a Wildcat wild 
pitch, Gaylord came home to seal the 
team’s first win of the season. 

On the defensive side, sophomore 
right hand-pitcher Camille Gaito 
dominated the pitcher’s mound with 
seven shutout innings. Gaito struck 
out six Wildcats, allowed three hits 
and retired eight straight batters.

All-American junior outfielder 
Kris Lesovsky went three-for-four on 
the day. Lesovsky holds the highest 
single season batting average record 
in UCSD’s softball program — last 
year she maintained a .446 batting 
average.

In the second game, the Tritons 
held a 2-0 advantage over Chico 
State, but lost it in the seventh inning 
to a successful Wildcat comeback. 
The game was eventually decided 
in extra innings, when Chico State 
scored in the eighth to win the game 
3-2. 

Woofter started the scoring for  
UCSD with a single, then pushed 
into scoring position by Eliades’s sac-
rifice bunt and Lesovsky’s single up 
the middle. 

UCSD women earned 
their first win against 
Central Washington, 
but lost to Chico later 
that night.

FENCING — The Tritons earned 
their best finish of the season with 
a fifth-place performance at the Cal 
State San Marcos Invitational on 
Feb. 8 and Feb. 9.

UCSD fired a three-round total 
of 907, finishing 39 strokes behind 
winner Holy Names University on a 
wet and soggy San Luis Rey Downs 
golf course. 

Junior captain Keith Okasaki and 
freshman Anubhav Rastogi finished 
in a tie for 20th at 11-over-par for 

the three rounds. Rastogi carded the 
lowest score of the tournament for 
the Tritons: two-under-par 70 in the 
final round. 

After struggling through the first 
two rounds, Rastogi changed his 
mental approach to the final round. 
He said he made some minor chang-
es before stepping on the first tee.

“I played smarter in the third 
round,” he said. “I stopped shoot-
ing right at the pins, so I didn’t put 
myself in bad positions if I missed 
the green. On the practice green, I 
switched my putting grip to one I 
used to use when I was kid. It was 

a little less fundamental and more 
about feel.” 

Something worked: Rastogi got 
up-and-down on three of his first 
six holes, and tallied birdies on the 
first two par fives.

He got as low as three under 
on the round before bogeying the 
13th, 14th and 15th holes. Back at 
level par, Rastogi gathered himself, 
bouncing back with birdies on the 
16th and 17th.

Knocking his approach to the 
18th green to only two feet, Rastogi 
had a chance to break 70 — a magic 
number for the golf team.

“[Head coach Mike] Wydra told 
me right before putting that I would 
be exempt for next year’s team and 
be on the roster for the [St. Edwards 
Invitational] if I broke 70,” Rastogi 
said. “I have never been that ner-
vous before.”

With a shot at 69 on the line, 
Rastogi pushed the two-footer. Even 
with the miss, Wydra was proud of 
Rastogi’s performance.

“[Rastogi] got to a point where 
his adrenaline made him stronger,” 
Wydra said. “He proved himself

The Tritons are 5-1 on the season at Triton Ballpark after completing a series sweep of Western Oregon University from Feb. 5 to Feb. 8.

By Cameron Tillisch� Senior Staff Writer

 

The No. 3 UCSD baseball team completed a four-
game sweep of No. 18 Western Oregon University 
last weekend. The Tritons showcased an even balance 
of offense and pitching over the weekend, proving 
themselves a worthy of a top seed in the conference.

The Tritons improve to 5-1 overall, and the 
Wolves fell to 0-4.

On Friday, the Tritons set the tone for the series, 
opening with back-to-back home runs off the bats of 
senior shortstop Vance Albitz and senior outfielder 
Robert Sedin. They won the game 12-6.

“We had a pretty solid weekend all around,” 
senior pitcher Matt Rossman said. “We came out on 
Friday and knocked around their guy pretty good, 
and set the tone for the weekend.”

Albitz was a triple shy of the cycle, going 4-5 with 
an RBI and a run. Junior outfielder Aaron Bauman, 
a Santa Barbara City College transfer, was key to 
the offense, going 3-4 with a pair of runs and RBIs. 
UCSD had a stellar offense showing overall, giving 

junior right-hander�Tim Shibuya plenty of breathing 
room. He finished the day with seven innings of work, 
giving up four earned runs with a walk and a couple 
strikeouts. 

On Sunday, the Tritons hosted a double-header 
with Western Oregon for the midsection of the series. 
Junior closer Guido Knudson earned the first victory, 
hurling two scoreless frames and striking out two. 
Senior right-hander Matt Rossman started the game 
for UCSD, throwing seven shutout innings and allow-
ing one earned run while striking out seven. 

In the bottom half of the fifth, junior third base-
man Evan Kehoe and senior first baseman Brandon 
Gregorich got on base with back-to-back singles and 
one out. When junior outfielder Kyle Saul stepped up 
to bat, he promptly drove a three-run shot over the left 
field fence to give UCSD the 3-1 lead. 

UCSD was threatened in the seventh after Western 
Oregon scored an unearned run, taking the score 
to 3-2. However, they couldn’t manage to score the 
insurance runs they needed to pad the lead, and soon 
found themselves down 4-3 heading into the ninth.

In the bottom of the ninth the Tritons rallied.

On Dec. 4, the draw for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Finals in South Africa was decided, 
and the 32 qualifying nations were 
split up into the customary eight 
groups of four teams. 

Each year without fail, a few of 
these groups take on new personali-
ties, generating drama and unpredict-
ability of end results, for which pre-
tournament seeds cannot account.

In the months leading up to the 
tournament in June and July, I will 
attempt to profile each group.

Kicking off the series is Group A; 
featuring host nation South Africa, 
WC06 runners-up France, a Mexican 

team with untapped potential, and the 
talented yet unproven Uruguay.

Group A power dynamic: Talent 
does not guarantee results. 

The host nation could not have 
asked for a more complicated draw 
— one that will jeopardize the Bafana 
Bafana’s chances for emerging from 
the group. The South Africans are 
the group’s supreme underdogs, and 
will be counting on their fans’ energy 
and “host nation” mojo in order to 
advance.

While the French and the 
Uruguayans have both seen rocky 
roads to qualification, the raw talent 
on each side is on par with the best in 
the world. Team chemistry pending, 
both sides emerge on paper as the 
group’s power brokers.

Mexico qualified behind the U.S. in 
qualification in the North and Central 
American regions. However, the team 
has proven pedigree at the highest 
level of competition, and is led by wily 
manager Javier Agguire — who, after 
coaching in Europe for the majority of 
the last decade, is well-versed in tactics 
at the highest level. However, any path 
to the round-of-16 will be through the 
men in blue: the French. 

Group Winners: France.
Barcelona forward Thierry 

Henry’s handball against Ireland in 
European qualification has shrouded 
the team and the talismanic striker in 
controversy — some in France have 
even expressed shame over the way 
in which they qualified. On top of 
“handgate,” their mercurial manager 
Raymond Domenech has done little 
to instill confidence in the Le Bleus 
faithful: His sporadic player selections 
have stifled team chemistry, and his
