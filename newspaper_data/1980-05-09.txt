Housing Bill Moves to Senate 
Berman Asks Students to Write Letters Against Discrimination 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Correlpondent 

Assemblyman Howard Berman, D-
Los Angeles, is appealing to students 
for help in passing his bill prohibiting

The bill passed the Assembly last 

March, with help from a student letter 
writing campaign which helped 
convince opposing Assembly 
members, but was defeated by the 
Senate before the September recess.

legislative sessions, and this year, as in 
others, there is tough opposition to the 
bill from realtors, who employ the most 
powerful lobbyist in the capital.

students . The Senate will reconsider 
the bill in June. 
. "It will be a very tough fight ," 
Berman predicted this week. "Right 
now we are short of votes." 

If passed, AB 224 would make it 
illegal for landlords to refuse to rent , 
sell or lease property to a prospective 
tenant solely because that individual is 
a student. Any landlord violating this 
law could be fined a minimum of $500 
or up to three times the actual damages 
to the student. 

Berman pointed to the shortage of 
housing around most campuses as well 
as the energy shortage that confronts 
students every year. "Discriminatory 
practices make it even more difficult for 
st udent s to find satisfactory 
accommodations ," said Berman. 

"The whole issue of tenants righta is 
involved," said Berman. 

"Realtors are afraid this bill wiD set a ' 
precedent for all the bills prohibiting 
housing discrimination against parenta 
with children, against the handicapped, 
the elderly, and just about everyone 
else," said Amiel Jaramillo, UC 
Student Lobby co-director. 

"Students can help by contacting 
their state senator in person or by 
phone or letter to urge passage of AB 
224," Berman wrote in a letter mailed 
to 300 "interested persons," people 
who have contacted his office about the

Foreign Language 
Shift is Ahead 

BY MICHAEL McKEE 
UCSD's language program will be completely restructured 

next year, reflecting a recent decision by the Academic 
Senate to reduce grading conflicts. 

These changes, proposed last quarter by the Linguistics 
Department, will affect only French, German and Spanish 
courses, while other languages offered through literature and 
directed studies courses will remain unchanged. 

The present structure demands that a student's oral and 
written abi~ties be combined into one grade, which is the 
cause of frequent disputes between students and their 
professors. The new system will allow for seperate grading of 
student's oral and written pro{~iency. ayoidifl3 these 
conflicts, according to Dr. Leonard Newmark, chairman of 
the Linguistics Department. 

The changes, approved April 24, provide for the following: 
- Termination of Language 5 and 6;

divided into two seperate two unit courses, one expressly for 
reading and writing, the other, speaking;

Lobby Conference Slated for UCSD 
First Time Ever; Sen. Biden Will Speak 

.. 

The UC Student Lobby, in conjunction with the AS, 
has announced plans for the first UC Spring Issue 
Conference, at which US Senator Joseph' Bielen, D· 
Delaware, will make his third campus appearance in 
three years. 

The Conference has been scheduled for May 17 & 18 
and will take place in the Student Center. 

According to Lobby Co-Director David Shontz, the 
prime emphasis for the Conference is student activism on 
issues the lobby has been pursuing in the last several 
years. 

Eighteen workshops are planned during the two day 
event. Topics to be discussed include the proposed 
budgetary impacts of Prop. 9, Nuclear Weapons 
Research, Student Evaluations of Teachers, Sexual 
Harassment, and the student's role in the Univeruty 
Governance. 

It is the first time the lobby conference has been held in 
Southern California. 

us Senator Joseph Biden, D-Delaware, win make hi. third camPUI 
appearance in three yean u part of the UC Student Lobby Conference. 

According to 
Shontz, "well infor-
med panelilta have 
been enlisted to 
conduct thorough 
and cohesive pre-
sentations on work· 

sh~ topics." 
The two day 

Conference is being 

coordinated by Lobby Interns Todd Spitzer and Jeff 
Lucas. 

"The Conference has been specifically deaigned to 
orient newly elected officers and other involved studenta 
with current campus related iuues. H.fully this wiD 
facilitate the transition between the old and the new 
student leaders and generate grass-root support for 
increased student involvement," Spitzer said. 

Conference Coordinator Jeff Lucas expresses his hope 
that the Conference will not only provide an excellent 
opportunity to stimulate student concern, but additionally 
will produce innovative ideas and workshops." 

Housing is being provided by ASUCSD in an effort to 
maintain costs at a minimum. A $15 to $20 fee wiD be 
charged to cover the costs for meals and all conference 
materials for the entire weekend. 

The UC Lobby serves at the direction of the Student 
Body President's Council, which is composed of a 
representative from each UC campus. UCSD's 
representative is outgoing AS External Affairs 
commissioner Linda Saba. 

Headquartered in Sacramento, the lobby has two co-
directors, David Shontz, Arniel Jaramillo and a staff of 
interns. 

The lobby has held past i ues se ions in Sacramento, 
but df'Cided, AS officials say, to come to Southern 
California t get the southern UC campuaes more involved 
in statewide i ues.

Iran Rescue 
Typical of 

Carter Disasters 

tl 

BY WIlliAM HAMILTON 
The tragic and abortive military 

fiasco in Iran last week is another in a 
series of administration blunders in 
the handling of the hostage situation. 

Direct military confrontation with 
Iranian militant students at the 
American embassy in Tehran was an 
absurd plan, and, now that the 
hostages have been relocated, one 
which cannot be repeated. It is 
doubtful, given the number of capton 
present at all times , whether an 

William Hamilton is a Daily 
Guardian arts writer. 

f:ntebbe·style raid could have 
IUCCeeded without needless sacrifice 
of lives. 
.. A naval blockade of Iran is the 
only viable miHtary action which 
could possibly succeed in begetting 
the release of the hostages in a 

~tracted conOict. 
Iran is dependent upon merchant 

marine shipments for 95 percent of its 
commerce. The purpose of a 
complete blockade of all shipments to 
and from Iran would be to win a war 
of attrition. 

Rail supplies from landlocked 
nation. could not compensate for the 
diminution of marine·tran.ported 
commodities in Iran. 

Another consequence of such 
action would be the termination of 
revenue Iran normally receives from 
oil exportation. With Iran'. economy 
in shambles already, Khomeini and 
Iran face a multitude of grave 
problems, including internal turmoil, 
revolt and an unsound political base. 

Thus it is likely tbat once the 
blockade begins to take its economic 
toll, after shifting the political 
leadership a few times, Khomeini 
would finally succumb to economic 
pressure and concede defeat, albeit 
on less humiliating terms that an all-
out war would dictate. 

The number of Iranian-registered 
and owned cargo ships is minute. 
Hence, they must depend upon 
freighters under other national flags 
and ownerships for most of their 
commerce, and could not themselves 
break a blockade. Should a blockade 
be imposed, shipping company 
officials will refuse to allow their 
freighters to sail. 

An insurance company, such as . 
LIoyds of London, will not insure any 
ship if its nautical course will take it 
through a blockade. A shipping 
company will not risk losing a vessel 
unless it is insured. 

Opponents of such a blockade 
proposal base their objections on 
essentially two groundsj first, that it 
could lead to war with Iranj and 
second, that US miHtary intervention 
could lead to a confrontation with the 
Soviet Union. These objections are 
untenable. 

The Iranian armed forces consists 
of a potpourri of outmoded US and 
Soviet·made weaponry, mOlt of 
which is in disrepair. Iran's state of 
preparedne81 for war can be 
illustrated by the fact that the Iranian 
government did not become aware of 
the aborted raid until after the 
American public did. 

They would have about the same 
chance againllt sophillticated US

Harassed by Rightists

On April 30 .upporters of the 
Socialist Worker. Party Presidential 
ticket of Pulley and Zimmermann set 
up a campaign table at US 
International University in San 
Diego. Shortly five right· wing 
American students began harrassing 
the socialists who were engll3ed in 
distributing campaign materials and 
selling the Militant, Youn, Socialist, 
and Perspectioa Mundial, and 
pamphlets in English and Farsi. The 
right·wingers physically threatened 
the socialists and made racist and 
sexist remarks about them and the 
Iranian students buying the titerature,

Off Iran, Send Back the Shah, Stor,

angered the right.wingers but won the 
support of the Black, A.ian, Iranian, 
Chicano, and white students. Scores 
of students stood around the table to 
defend it from the pro-Shah 
Americans. 

Campu. admini.trators and 
security were called by the right· 
wingers to remove the socialists from 
campus. At first the administrators 
tried to restrict the right. of the 
campaigner., but under pressure 
from a crowd of 200 Iranian .tudents 
and threats of legal action, they 
affirmed our right to sell and

of literature was stolen by the 
reactionary .tudent. but soon 
retrieved through the help of the 
I ranian students and campus 
security. A film .ponsored by Iranian 
students on campus was cancelled by 
the administrator. under the guise 
that there was a dangerous situation 
and there had been a bomb threat.

Balanced Budget 
Moves through Senate 

WASHINGTON - The 
Senate yesterday held to the 
balanced budget course set by 
its Budget Committee despite 
conservative claims that a 
worsening recession means 
deeper spending cuts are 
needed to eliminate the deficit. 

By a 53-39 margin, the 
Senate tabled, effectively 
~ killing, a plan by Sen. Orrin 
Hatch, R -Utah , to cut 
spending in the proposed 
$612.9 billion 1981 budget 
by an additional $,3 billion to 
guarantee a business tax cut 
and no deficit. 

Hatch argued that the 
deteriorating economy will 
push unemployment higher 
than had been expected in 
fiscal 1981 , which' starts Oct. 
I , throwing the committee's 
projected balanced budget out 
of whack. 

" New economic forecasts of 
a deepening recession show 
that this budget is already out 
of balance," he said. 

The vote came as the 

Senate pressed to complete 
work on its defense·oriented 
spending plan and join the 
House in approving the first 
balanced federal budget in 12 
years. 

Senate Majority Leader 
Robert C. Byrd, D- WV, said 
he had hoped the Senate 
would finish its version of the 
budget last night so work could 
begin reconciling it with the 
House package. However , a 
long list of amendments still to 
be considered made achieving 
Byrd's goal doubtful. 

In addition to setting 1981 
spending targets, the budget 
package would raise the 1980 
spending cei ling which was 
breached in March and is 
preventing approval of new 
federal spending. 

The Agriculture Depart. 
ment has warned that unless 
Congress approves additiorial 
money for food stamps, those 
benefits will be cut off to the 
program ' s 21 million 
recipients on June 1_

Iranians Will 
Rotate Hostages 

The Iranian militants 
holding the American 
hostages intend to rotate them 
among a number of cities, 
sending those with the most 
suspicious backgrounds to the 
least pleasant locations, a 
Tehran newspaper said 
yesterday. 

The conservative news· 
paper Donya Iran said the 
militants, who earlier this week 
reported keeping the 53 
hostages in Tehran and 12 
other c.ities, planned to rotate 
them so that .. American 
intelligence will be confused." 
The militants began dispersing 
the hostages after an aborted 
US rescue mission April 25 
that killed eight American 
servicemen in the desert 200 
miles east of Tehran. 

One of the American 
hostages hal tried to commit 

suicide three times and may be 
dead, Italian journalist Oriana 
F allaci has reported, quoting 
an unidentified source. She did 
not name the hostage. 

UN Tells Israel 
To End Exile 

UNITED NATIONS 
The Security Council adopted 
a resolution yesterday calling 
on Israel to allow the return of

expelled from the occupied 
West Bank of the Jordan 
River last weekend. 

The United States 
abstained and the resolution 
was approved 14·0. 

US Ambassador William 
vanden Heuvel noted that the 
resolution did not refer to the 
action that prompted 
Saturday's expulsions - the 
Palestinian guerrilla killing of 
six Israelis in Hebron the night 
before.

Universe Will 
Disintegrate, vel Says 
IRVINE (AP) - An 
u~~rground .water tank deep 
wlthm an OhIO salt mine may 
tell scientists whether all 
mailer - everything that 
exists in the universe - will 
ultimately decay into formless 
bundles of energy . 

Although that eventual 
catastrophe seems possible 
there's no reason for a1arrr: 
anytime soon, since 
"eventuallr is a vesy large 
number,' says physicist 
Henry Sobel of UC Irvine. 

The universe has many biJ~ons of years left before 
thin~s might start falling apart. 

I The $2 million experiment, 
due to begin near Cleveland 
late this year, is designed to 
find out whether protons -
particles that inhabit the 
nudeus of an atom - will 
spontaneously break apart 

into smaller and smaller 
particles, Sobel said in a 
telephone interview. 

The proton , a major 
component of all elements 
was traditionally believed to ~ 
a stable particle that lasts 
forever. But Sobel said recent 
theories suggest this decay 
should occur even though the 
proton is tightly bound into the 
center of an atom that is, in -
turn, part of something else, 
such as a gold coin or a 
fingernail. 

Once a proton comes apart, 
he said, the pieces can never 
be put back together -
" unless there's another 
creation." 

If the universe eventually 
runs out of protons then 
malter itself must dis~ppe~.

Playoffs Baseball T eaDl -In 
Violations Knock Out Other Squads 

No, the 1980 UCSD baseball season is 
not dead yet. 

It was revived last Tuesday night in a 
District III coaches' meeting when the 
Tritons were awarded a playoff berth in 
!he qualifying round of the district's post· 
leason competition. 

Two powerful teams , La Verne and 
Azusa Pacific colleges , were disqualified 
from pOlt·season play because of 
infractionl of National Intercollegiate 
Athletics re,wations. 

La Verne s athletic department failed to 
send their eligibi~ty rosier to the 
association's offices before the specified 
deadline. And Azusa Pacific was guilty of 
using a player who had played 
profesai9nally for a team in Mexico. Both 
achools were forced to forfeit their league 
games because of these infraction •. 

With these two schools out of the 
playoffl, the District III competition took 
on a much different look than was 
originally expected at the conclusion of 
league play two weeki ago. 

Point Lorna College and Biola College 
received byes in the qualifying rounds of 
their reKUlar season records . 

ucsI>, Southern Cal College, the 
University of Redlands and Cal Lutheran 

face Southern Cal CoUege at La Verne 
this Saturday, with the University of 
Redlands squaring off against Cal 
Lutheran. The winners of the qualifying 
round contes~ move on to compete 
against either Biola or Point Lorna. 

UCSD, with a 14-23 season, was the 
last team to be selected for a playoff berth. 
After the forfeits were figured into all of 
the remaining schools' records, UCSD 
found itself tied with Cal Baptist for the 
last position. 

UCSD got the nod because they 
defeated Cal Baptist in a doubleheader on 
Olsen Field earlier this season. 

Members of the baseball team took the 
news of their renewed life with surprised 
excitement. They picked up their 
uniforms this past Wednesday with 
whoop. and hollers. 

Coach Askey say. that practice has 
been enthusiastic, eapeciaIly among the 
senior •. 

What dfect the two-week vacation will 
have on the Tritons' performance remains 
to be seen. UCSD ended their regular 
season on a high point by winning three of 
their last four games, defeating USD, an 
NCAA Division I school.

AII-Callntramurals 
Scheduled for UCSD 

The Daily' Guardian 

Sports 
With intramurals as big 

as they are here at UCSD, it 
seem. almost appropriate 
the southern most member 
of the UC system be the 
host of the 16th annual All· 
Cal Intr amur al Sports 
Fes tival. 

It will be the first time 
UCSD has ever held the 
festi vities. Because of 
airfare, the high costs of 
flying the participants this 
far south has kept the 
games to the north. 

The 1980 version of the 
AU·Cals will be a bit 
"watered-down" because of 
the costs of getting here. 
Therefore, the festivities 
will be ~mited to three 
sports, softball, volleyball 
and tennis . Waterpolo, 
which is the usual fourth 
spot, was the victim of 
finances. 

Each school in the UC 
system will send a team of 
16 to 18 intramural 
athletes, accompanied by 
the school's 1M director, to 

represent their school in the 
event, which will be held all 
day today and Saturday. 

Though only three sports 
will be contested , 1M 
director Mike Hipp has 
implemented a novel idea, 
which should add some 
spice to the second day of 
the festival . 

''We wal have an Over· 
the·line tournament down 
at the Mission Bay Aquatic 
Center on Saturday," said 
Hipp. 

"In the past, athletes 
have been so burned out on 
the second day, they don't 
even want to play any 
mOle. So we think this wiD 
make the .econd day just as 
much fun." 

each school will receive a 
participant's T-shirt and 
free meals during their stay. 

The competition begins 
this morning with softball, 

the ceremonial first pitch to 
be thrown out at 10 am. 
VoUeyball and tennis are 
scheduled to begin around 
11 am.

Theatre/Beth Accomando 

No Ariel Display in BBe .'T entpest' 
The Tempes t is Shakes-

peare's's last completed play 
and had been appropriately 
chosen to close the second 
season of TV's Shakespeare 
Plays. The Tempest is one of 
Shakespeare's most lyrically 
beautiful plays but the BBC 
production, though it has its 
merits , is too earthbound and 
unmagical. 

Shakespeare had a shrewd 
sense of what the public 
wanted, and his later plays 
reveal a change in style that 
takes not of a new kind of 
drama - the tragicomedies 
and the romances_ The 
Tempese is the best of these 
latter plays . It is set on a 
timeless, magical 'isle where 
Prospero, the usurped Duke of 
Milan, and his daughter, 
Miranda, have been living. 
They are the sole human 
inhabitants of the isle. 
Prospero, with his keen 
intelligence and powers of 
magic, controls everything in 
hi. environment, including an 
ethereal spirit named Ariel and 
an enslaved beast called 
Caliban. The play opens with 
Prospero conjuring up a 
tempest which wiD shipwreck 
hi. enemies on the isle and set 
the scene for an eventual 
confrontation. 

The Tempest is fiUed with 
magic and fantasy. and the 
play requires an imagina tive 
approach that can combine 
these elements with the serious 
themes. However. the BBC 
production. directed by John 
Gorrie, plays against these 
etherial qualities with an 
incongruous heaviness. The 
sets and costumes blend 
together in sullen earth tones 
that create a bland visual style. 
Even Ariel who, as his name 
implies, is a delicate spirit of 
the air blends into the ground 
and the leaden cliffs , though hs 
is allowed to melt into thin air 
- a well-used effect. TV has a 
great deal of advantages over 
the stage in terms of special 
effects but this production 
fails, for the most part, to 
make use of these potentials. 
The Tempest does need a 
dark , melancholy edge to 
contr ast the fairy tale setting, 
but this edge should come 
from the dialogue and the 
performers rather than from 
the visual style. 

The Shakespeare Plays 
have shown a tendency to be 
static recitations and this 
problem is also evident in The 
Tempest , which relies heavily 
on speeches and pageantry.

Field Guide to Extraterrestrials 
Barlowe ' s Guide to 
Extraterrestrials, 
by Wayne Douglas Barlowe, 
Workman Press, $7.95 

I have an image of UCSD 
perhaps a hundred years from 
now, when mopeds have been 
replac e d by ant i- grav 
platforms, and paper books 
are considered to be quaint 
and cumbersome. If we were 
to wander into USB 2722, we 
would discover student s 
working diligently and 
furiously on their personal 
computers. 

a liens which he read about in 
science fiction novels_ What 
made Barlowe so good was his 
con ce rn for imm ac ul a te 
scientifically accurate detail. 

H is paintin gs w e r e 
e la bora te, painstakingl y 
executed only after he had 
carefully researched both the 
physical descriptions provided 
by authors, and th e 
enviromental factors which 
would have shaped the 
physical structure of each 
alien_ 

Tales, and often showed a 
droolin g r e ptil i an - typ e 
creature threatening the life of 
some scantily clad woman. 

These " Bug-eyed mon-
sters" rapidly became more 
sophisticated, in the hands of 
artists such as Roger Dean 
a nd Frank Frazetta . 

Nevertheless, extraterrestrials 
be for e B a rlow e w e re 
essentially creahons of the! 
imagination, and did not serve 
the same purpose of preparing 
humankind for contact and 
mutual relations with aliens. 

21st century. we have much 
more accurate and detailed 
descriptions of the extrater-
restrial.. Barlowe is fondy 
looked upon aa a visionary, 
who prepared the foundations 
for a host of other artiats who 
had an 'advantage that 
Barlowe, in his early year .. did 
not have: drawing aliena from 
real life. 

The professor pauses, a 
nostalgic smile on her face. 
Now, towards the end of the 

'Spring Awakening' 
This is Exobiology 14, a 

lower division introductory 
course which describes the 
history of human contact with 
aliens, from the pre-
enli g htened UFO days 
through the first galactic 
conference on non-terrestrial 
intelligence_ 

" We spent countless 
afternoons ... figuring out the 
evolution of each alien, based 
on its biological type and 
ecological conditions ," wrote 
Barlowe about his work. "We 
wanted entities that challenged 
the imagination, that had been 
created out of all of mankind's 
knowledge and then some.

play by Frank Wedkind will be

Barlo w e's Guide to 
Extraterrestrials is being 
discussed by the shimmering, 
slightly out of focus hologram 
of the professor (she is actually 
conducting research on one of 
the many orbiting space 
colonies above the earth, but 
being concerned about her 
students, she is transmitting 
her lecture in real-time via 
communications laser) . 

Wayne Douglas Barlowe, 
we learn, was an iDustrator 
trained both in art and biology. 
His fascination for science 
fiction and fantasy prompted 
him to draw and paint the 

"But extrapolations into the 
future had to be scientifically 
believable. The creatures 
could appear outlandish - the 
work could be stimulating and 
exciting - but it had to adhere 
to an inner emotional and 
biological truth." 

Wayne Douglas Barlowe, 
state the professor, is the 
proper progenitor of accurate 
exobiological illustration . 

Of course, there were 
illustrators before Barlowe 
who drew pictures of aliens. 
The first paintings of aliens 
were printed on the covers of 
"pulp" magazines such as

Toughen Up on Iran 
Conlinued from page 2 
forces in the area al the Spanish 
Armada againllt a hurricane. ~or 
Khomeini to invite war With 
America would be 1UicidaI. 

To believe that a blockade would 
resuk in a confrontation with the 
Soviets is WacioII_ There il no 
historical baais &om which to re8IOIl 
that the Sovieb desire such a 
confrontation. 

In the hislory 01 ~ between 
the US and the Soviet union, there 
have been two incidenb in which a 
confrontation occurred: the Berlin 
Crilil, and the Cuban Blockade. In 
both calel, the Soviets had 
immediate geographical and military 
ihlerests, and in both cases, they 
backed down. 

The RUllians respect American 
military strength, irrespective of what 
Pentagon alarmists, in the hope of 
garnering a few more billions for 
defense spending, tell us. 

Conventionally, especially in the 
fields of electronics and computers, 

they are hopelessly outdistanced. In 
nudear weapons we are about on par, 
unless one believes that there can be a 
dear·cut victor in a suicide contest. 

A. Ct.JrchiB 10 aptly pointed out, 
military 'Ir~h it about. the only 
thing the Soviet. respect, gwen thell' 
own actions in Eutern Europe and 
the Third World - certainly not 
territoriailOvereianty and the right to 
life and tiberty. 

The Soviet. have enough pro~ems 
with their own economy and naIJonal 
image to risk even ' a convent~nal 
ultimatum from the Amencan 
government. 

Finally, there is a precendential 
aspect to thill situation which cannot 
be overlooked. When Kustafa's 
rebels seized the Soviet embassy in 
Pakistan in 1978, Soviet troops 
retook control within 24 hours. 
Pakistan made no attempt to repel the 
invasion, and the Soviets aemanded 
and received reparation before 
withdrawing their troops. 

Iran's motives for laking the 
embassy are immaterial to the 
principle of sanctity of Americna 
property, and their actions have been 
condemned by virtually every nation 
in the world, including the Soviet 
Union. 

Any breach of international law in 
thil matter is unconscionable, and we 
must demon.trate to violators that 
such action wiD not be tolerated. 

Unlesl the American people are 
willing to become i50lat~nist.' ~e 
need embassies and emmlssarJell m 
order to maintain eHective diplomatic 
relationships with other nations. But 
years from now, how will we be able 
to recruit talented and first·rate 
diplomatic minds if they see that their 
government will allow such violations 
to go unpunished? 

This is not to suggest that US show 
of force will completely deter such 
future incidents; but for our 
government to continue a "wait and 
see" posture throughout this affair, 
can only lower American esteem in 
the eyes of the world and encourage 
others who would likewise perpetrate 
such a diplomatic affront.

seems to go along with the Q..verall 
image of toughneu and 
inacces.ibility that the Pretenders 
project. These people aren't fighting 
for paI.ion and love and a more 
humane world like F.Jvis Costello 01 
Graham Parker-they're fighting for 
their own egos that won't let go and 
give in to love. 

They belong to the nihilistic, 
destructive group of new wave bands 
that just want to strut and wipe oul. I 
don't see any cultural progress or 
musical achievement there, nothing-
that reaches way down inside you and 
moves you all around. 

That hundreds of people docilely 
submit themselves to aural violence 
and find relish in it only indicates the 
pathetic state of the masses right now. 
I would like to think that people aren't

organizers said last night.

adminishation and the right-wingers. 

The San Diego Union ran a May 
lst article entitled "Bomb Warning 
Causes Stir on USIU Campus." It 
blamed the "disturbance" on the 
socialists, saying we were responsible 
for the bomb threat and the disruption 
of classes. In fact the opposite is the 
truth. Five right-wing students caused 
the disruption and made it clear they 
did not want the film to be shown. 
,This interference with the election 
campaign violates our first 
amendment rights and under Federal 
Election Laws is punishable by six 
months in jail and a $10,000 fine. In 
the article USIU Executive V.P. 
Allison says, "Lots of Iranian and 
A,rnericans were upset by ... this guy 
trying to distribute propaganda ... " 
This is a ~e. Hundreds of Iranians and 
other students supported us. AI~~n 

stuff, along with the disruption of the 
film-showing by the bomb scare, were 
part of the same plan ... " Another lie. 
We supported the film -showing but 
the right-wingers did not.
