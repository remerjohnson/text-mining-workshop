UCSD and UC Davis 
Only UCs to Waitlist 
Transfer Students

Students Work to Promote 
Sweatshop-Free Apparel

World in Your Hands

JOHN HANACEK/Guardian

Students created mini hanging terrariums on Wednesday, May 4 at Main Gym Tiki Conference Room. The 
workshop — which included planting cacti in a clear spherical case — was offered by the recreation department. 

Following in the footsteps of UCLA, A.S. Council unanmiously passed a resolution  on May 4 requesting the 
UCSD bookstore promote sweatshop-free 
apparel. 

UCLA passed its corresponding 
resolution after a demonstration by students 
in February; the school hopes to increase 
revenue to over $16,000. According to 
the Daily Bruin, other schools, like Duke 
University, have purchased over $200,000 
worth of apparel.

UCSD has carried apparel from Alta 
Gracia — a company based in the Dominican 
Republic that pays higher wages (or “living” 
wages) to its workers instead of minimum 
wage — since last fall.

According to UCSD Bookstore Director 
Don Moon, the bookstore currently carries 

T-shirts and sweatshirts from Alta Gracia. 
Four types are women’s items and three types 
are men’s items. These items have been here 
since last fall and some of the women’s items 
have sold out this year.

“We are supportive of Alta Gracia, 
we think it’s a good cause and we have 
some plans for the fall, so we will see what 
happens,” he said.

Right now, the bookstore has a hang-tag 
in place to advertise the Alta Gracia story, 
but next year, they plan on having a branded 
area within the bookstore to promote the 
company. 

“I’m caught off-guard [by the resolution] 
because I don’t think it’s necessary to propose 
one,” Moon said. “We are making every 
effort to bring in more product for the fall, 
so it surprises me.”

According to Moon, bookstore officials 
are mostly waiting for Alta Gracia’s selection 
and graphics to improve in order to gain 
more customer interest in the line.

The Worker Rights Consortium — a 
nonprofit organization that serves as 
independent labor watchdog organization — 
established the living wage of the Dominican 
Republic with the assistance of 180 affiliated 
universities.

According to the WRC, in the Dominican 
Republic, the legal minimum wage is $0.84  
hourly in U.S. dollars. To meet basic needs of 
their families — including food, clean water, 
housing and healthcare — WRC determined 
that the living wage should be $2.83 in U.S. 
dollars. Alta Gracia pays its workers $9.62

UCSD is waitlisting 1,500 transfer students for the 2011-
12 year, according to new admissions data. 

This is the first year that UC schools have used a waitlist 
for transfer students; of these schools, UCSD and UC Davis 
are the only universities implementing this change. 

Approximately 7,196 transfer students were admitted 
for the 2011-12 school year, with the final decisions made 
on May 1. Students have until May 15 to state if they want 
to be considered for the waitlist process. Waitlisted students 
will find out if they are admitted no later than June 10. 
Transfer students who have been accepted have until June 1 
to submit a statement of intent.

UC Interim Undergraduate Admissions Director 
Pamela Burnett said that admissions offices have difficulty 
projecting the correct number of students they need to 
admit to hit enrollment targets. UC schools must wait for 
admitted students to make their decisions before taking 
any more students. The decision to enroll at a campus is 
affected by the economy and the admissions offers the 
students have received.

“The university’s steep budget reductions mean 
that campuses are operating without much tolerance 
to differences between actual enrollments and targeted 
enrollments,” Burnett said.

The system for admitting waitlisted students is the same 
as the one used to admit students. It is a comprehensive 
review of the student’s application that includes factors 
such as academic achievement, educational environment, 
low family income and personal challenges.

“The same standards apply,”  UCSD spokesperson 
Christine Clark said. “It’s not different for students on the  
waitlist.”

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Admissions Mae Brown 
said UCSD is undecided over how many transfers it will 
take off the waitlist. 

“Those students on the waitlist have not been offered 
admission, however, if we have space, will offer admission 
after the June 1 deadline,” Brown said. “Those admitted have 
received a letter congratulating them on their admission to 
the university.” 

All students with a Transfer Admission Guarantee — 
which gives admission to those who have completed core 
courses and meet GPA requirements — were admitted.

UC Davis Admin. Monitored Student 
Activists Involved in Campus Protests
By Nicole Chan
Staff Writer

UC Davis students and staff, in conjunction with 
the Sacramento chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, held a press conference on April 12 to raise 
awareness of student monitoring on the Davis campus 
and potentially at others within the UC system.  

Davis student Bryan Sparks filed a request under 
the Freedom of Information Act and the California 
Public Records Act in December 2010 upon suspicion 
of police infiltration for documents indicating 
surveillance of student activism activity. As many as 
280 pages of documents were released this March, 
indicating email correspondences used to monitor 

student activity through Facebook profiles, events and 
student org listservs. 

According to UC Davis senior and conference 
coordinator Eric Lee, undercover police attended 
protests and were responsible for alerting supervisors 
of the movements of students throughout campus. 
According to “Administrators Formalize Team to 
Monitor Student Activism,” published April 5 in the 
official UC Davis student newspaper, the Aggie, police 
officer Joanne Zekany attended the March 2 protest in 
plain clothes and lied to students about her identity. 

Lee, other student activists and ACLU are looking 
into the legality of the administration’s actions, but at

the moment do not have the funds to 
access a legal team.  

The police officer’s response 
was inappropriate, UC Davis Vice 
Chancellor of Administrative and 
Resource Management John Meyer 
acknowledged in “Administrators 
Formalize Team to Monitor Student 
Activism,” published April 5 in the 
Aggie. Meyer added that officers will 
not hide their identities in the future.

According to Lee, the request 
revealed the formation of a Student 
Activism Response Team composed of 
administrators, faculty and students in 
August 2010 in response to the 2009-
10 academic year UC tuition increases. 

The 34-member team worked with 
police to anticipate student-led actions 
and rallies. 

“We really are there for them,” 
response team volunteer Jeff Austin 
said in “Students Say UC Davis 
Violates Their Free Speech By Spying 
on Protests,” published April 12 in the 
Sacramento Bee. “We’re not spying, 
we’re not taking names. We’re just 
trying to make sure they stay safe,” 
Austin said.

According to Lee, at least one 
member was responsible for recording 
students’ actions during campus 
protests by taking photos and writing 
notes.

Lee said this issue raises concerns 

of student privacy and freedom of 
speech. 

“The administration claims to be 
supportive of us, but this shows that 
they are not,” Lee said.

UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi 
responded to Lee’s guest commentary, 
published March 10 in the Aggie,  
with a March 14 statement on the 
UC Davis website entitled ‘“Embracing 
Activism.” 

“Our own concerns about 
safety grew after the March 4, 2010, 
demonstrations, when a crowd 
of about 300 students and their 
supporters threatened to march onto 
Interstate 80,” Katehi wrote. “We saw 
the potential for increased threats to 

life and property and, at that point, 
formalized our efforts into the Student 
Activism Team. There is absolutely 
nothing nefarious or under-handed 
about this team’s organization or 
objectives. Indeed, in the very 
documents referenced in the Aggie 
guest opinion, the mission of Student 
Affairs is clearly laid out as it relates 
to responding to student activism: 
‘to support freedom of expression, 
promote student safety, educate the 
campus on free speech policy and 
assist in preventing disruption of 
normal campus activities.’”

Katehi acknowledges the

C alifornia Review Editor in Chief Alec Weisman wel-comed the sitting council 
to its last meeting with a speech 
about its failure as student represen-
tatives. “A bunch 
of four-year-olds 
could do a bet-
ter job than you,” 
Weisman said. 
Councilmembers 
responded by 
applauding.  

Asian and 
Pacific-Islander Student Association 
Vice President of Finance Thai Do 
and Social Programming Chair Allan 
Castaneda thanked council for lis-
tening to them during the previous 
meeting and declined council’s offer 
of an underwrite because they are a 
non-profit organization.

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang sponsored 
amendments to the mandate reserves 
that changed the voting majority, the 
rollover from the general initiatives 
fund and restrictions on the mandate 
reserves. The Campus Affairs com-
mittee slashed 3 percent of activity fee 
income that mandate reserves receive 
every year. Ang opposed the decision 
of the committee; he emphasized the 
importance of having savings and 
investments, especially because the 
mandate reserves are currently below 
$500,000. 

Campuswide Senator Elizabeth 
Elman said it didn’t make sense to 
withhold funds from the students 
unless there was a clear plan of how 
future students will benefit. Ang 
countered by saying that the reserves 
need to remain consistent throughout 
the year. 

The 3 percent  was unslashed and 
the original legislation was passed.

The Financing Principles 
Committee gave a presentation about 

what council should be looking at 
when making the decision to fund 
a program or event. The commit-
tee stressed community engagement, 
ownership, empowerment and sus-

tainable progress.
President Wafa 

Ben Hassine 
tried to pass an 
amendment cre-
ating council 
repres ent at ives 
for the Student 
S u s t a i n a b i l i t y 

Collective and SPACES, and 
was shot down in a 6-20-5 vote. 
Councilmembers said they were wor-
ried that Ben Hassine was trying 
to institutionalize representation in 
order to make the organizations liable 
to council. 

Ben Hassine opened approv-
al of the appointments of the two 
new judicial board members, Carl 
Welliver and Andrew Garcia. 

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu and Associated Vice 
President of Student Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt were concerned wanted to 
personally hear their applicants’ qual-
ifications. 

Ben Hassine said she contacted 
other executive board members and 
they were unavailable to meet. The 
new members were then approved.

Council argued over approving 
the UC Student Association budget 
because it was a last-minute discus-
sion, but it was ultimately approved.

Ben Hassine asked future coun-
cilmembers to respect the differences 
in opinion that will likely exist in any 
council. 

“I’ve had a love/hate relation-
ship with you all,” Ben Hassine 
said, “You’re like my kids, I’ve 
seen so many of you grow and 
mature. I am excited to be done 
and pass the torch to Alyssa Wing.”

“The WRC’s mission is to ensure 

that university logo apparel is produced 
in factories where workers are paid a 
genuine living wage that is sufficient to 
support themselves and their families 
and enjoy respect for all other basic 
rights, as embodied in university codes 
of conduct,” WRC communications 
director Theresa Haas said. 

According to Haas, there are 
approximately 350 campus stores that 
carry Alta Gracia’s product nationwide.

“Our hope for Alta Gracia is that 
the factory will continue to grow and 
will serve as a model for the rest of the 
apparel industry,” Haas said.

Muir College senior and co-chair of 
the Student Worker Collective  — the 
group that proposed the resolution —  

Arianna Peregretti said the resolution 
is asking council to show it support. 

“We are asking A.S. to support 
us in [the resolution] and to take the 
time to let the bookstore know that 
they are behind wanting to increase 
orders for the bookstore, community 
events, and conferences around 
campus,” Peregretti said.

Campuswide Senator Victor 
Flores-Osorio said he hopes 
council write a letter to bookstore 
management showing its support for 
Alta Gracia and other sweatshop-free 
apparel.

“When I ran for campuswide 
senator, one of my main platforms 
was social justice, and I see this 
as a way that UCSD can promote 
social justice,” he said. “I really 
doubt there will be much contention 

[surrounding the resolution] because 
this is a neutral resolution in that it 
promotes a clothing line and most 
people would agree that sweatshop-
free is a good thing.”

Peregretti sees the effort to bring 
in Alta Gracia apparel as part of a 
national to make people more aware 
about their clothing origins.

“If you take the time to actually 
look up and beyond your schoolbooks 
and see things that actually affect the 
framework of our society, you will see 
that doing something so small like 
buying a sweater from Alta Gracia, 
you’re taking the initiative to say that 
there are more important things out 
there than myself,” Peregretti said.

administration could have been better 
at educating the campus about the 
Student Activism Response Team, and 
added that the team protocol will be 
published to the Center for Student 
Involvement website.

UC Davis administrators have 
promised to no longer use undercover 
police to monitor student protests, but 
do not plan to disband the Student 
Activism Response Team, according 
to Lee. He said that many think it a 
weak compromise, but one that serves 
as administrators’ admission that they 
were in the wrong,.  

Team members were required 
to prevent student behavior from 
becoming disruptive by issuing 
warnings or referring students to 
Student Judicial Affairs for review.

Members included  Katehi and 
Police Chief Annette Spicuzza. 
According to Lee, members were 
required to attend general body 
meetings and student movements 

unidentified, as well as report 
information to police and the 
chancellor. The response team was 
required to accompany students, 
should protests move through 
campus, and inform students of any 
safety issues and risks.

“Since we’ve had a more 
formalized team that got a little more 
training, we’ve not had any arrests on 
this campus, unlike other campuses,” 
UC Davis Associate Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Griselda Castro 
said in an interview with the Aggie. 
“We have not stopped activity. We 
have not infringed upon students’ 
rights to express themselves.”

According to “Big Brother 
on Campus,” an April 25 article 
published by the Chronicle of 
Higher Education, campus activists 
published names and photographs 
of members involved in the response 
team. Although members of the team 
were not paid for their involvement, 
students argue that the creation of 

the team wastes taxpayer resources 
and shows the hypocritical nature 
of the administration that does not 
align with the UC system’s mission, 
Lee said.  

According to Lee, Katehi was 
quoted as saying the program 
was intended to protect students 
and property in the path of 
protest. 

“The peaceful protesting of the 
students doesn’t merit this kind of 
response,” Lee said.

He added that the purpose of 
the press conference was to publicize 
the situation for other schools and 
support the First Amendment.  

Davis students are communicating 
with universities across the nation, 
who are currently filing their own 
requests. Lee is in contact with two 
UC campuses, but confirmed that he 
is not in contact with UCSD students.

For ten years, Americans awaited the death of Osama Bin Laden. On Sunday, he was 
finally found and killed by the elite 
SEAL Team Six. But despite this vic-
tory, the fight for American security 
is far from over.

Many Americans paraded outside 
the White House Sunday, but the 
death of Bin Laden does not mean 
troops will be brought home or that 
peace has been achieved. Far from 
it, in fact, as we are still engaged in 
three wars, and there appears to be 
no end in sight for terrorist attacks.

Bin Laden’s death is more a 
symbolic victory than anything 
else, as he had eluded American 
forces for so long. His mystique gave 
the impression that al-Qaeda was 
impenetrable, but that mystique is 
no more.

There are a couple tangible gains. 
The commando group that raided 
Bin Laden’s compound also retrieved 
numerous documents and laptops 
that will be invaluable in stemming 
the tide of terrorism across the 
world. 

And by authorizing the opera-
tion, President Obama has gained 
significant political clout regarding 
foreign policy. The Taliban, already 
demoralized from fighting for so 
long, will be more likely to make a 
deal in Afghanistan, and Republican 
opposition at home will be less 
inclined to criticize Obama on for-
eign policy.

Since Bin Laden was caught in 
an urban center in Pakistan, the heat 
is also on the Pakistani government 
for not knowing about this earlier. 
Pakistan’s embarrassment will allow 
America to successfully pressure 
them in engaging more forcefully 
with terrorists in the northwestern 
part of their country. After receiv-
ing $1.5 billion in U.S. aid, Pakistan 
must step up its operations against 
the notorious Haqqani Network, a 
militia group hiding in Pakistan that 
has killed many American soldiers.

Nevertheless, al-Qaeda is a 
decentralized organization — mean-
ing Bin Laden’s death will likely have 
little effect on terrorism in Iraq, the 
Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. 
Even then, there is also Ayman al-
Zawahiri, Bin Laden’s lieutenant, 
as a clear second-in-command. Bin 
Laden has already become a martyr 
for many followers of al-Qaeda, and 
terrorist groups are plotting revenge.  

Only last year, the renowned 
underwear bomber Umar Farouk 
Abdulmutallab attempted to destroy 
a plane over Michigan. Last week, 
German authorities arrested al-Qae-
da militants suspected of planning a 
bombing in Germany. Sixteen people 
killed by a bomb blast in Morocco 
were also likely victims of al-Qaeda 
members. Unless security forces 
remain vigilant, innocents are at risk 
everywhere — even with the death 
of al-Qaeda’s number one. 

Celebration is premature as 
terrorist groups continue to oper-
ate freely. The relatively peaceful 
Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions 
attest to the fact that al-Qaeda’s 
ideology is a dying one, but enough 
extremists still exist to spread vio-
lence. Bin Laden’s death is nothing to 
be scoffed at, but it would be naïve 
to treat this as mission accomplished.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

 
Dear Editor,
     The External Affairs office 
would like to make a statement in 
regards to the Womyn of Color 
Conference at UC Santa Cruz from 
April 29 to May 1.   
     It has come to our attention that 
certain students have been con-
fused by the selection process. As 
a result, they have taken to social 
media networks to express their 
displeasure and spread false rumors 
regarding the office and our opera-
tions. 
     We would like to clarify that: 
- Our budget has been meticulously 
managed since the beginning of the 
school year to include each confer-
ence’s costs. WOCC is our last con-
ference and we have allocated our 

money for a delegation of 28.   
Our delegation size was also due 

to the lack of efficient communica-
tion from the hosting campus. 
Thus, we have a highly selective 
application process, with criteria 
based on the quality of applica-
tion responses in order to ensure 
that the most qualified applicants 
become a part of our delegation. 
- With this conference, like our 
previous ones, the office does not 
discriminate on any basis. We 
strongly refute the claim that stu-
dents who identify as male should 
be in any way disadvantaged when 
it comes to our selection process. 
We would like to emphasize that 
the office does not prioritize any-
one based on his or her gender — 
delegates are selected based on the 
quality of their applications. 
     We promote a diverse delega-
tion to guarantee that different 

students can take away from these 
conferences their own experiences. 
Upon returning to campus, these 
students can then bring back their 
knowledge to various organizations 
of which they are a part. 
     Please email asvpexternal@ucsd.
edu for any questions or concerns. 

— Michael Lam
Vice President External Affairs, 

Associated Students
 

Dear Editor,
       There seems to be a misunder-
standing as to why students oppose 
Students for Justice in Palestine’s 
(SJP) divestment bill. Some would 
say that our student government 
has passed similar divestment bills 
in the past, therefore divesting from 

General Electric and Northrop 
Grumman doesn’t necessarily dele-
gitimize anyone. 

The fact is that a bill calling to 
divest from corporations that do 
business with the Israeli Defense 
Forces (IDF) is somewhat differ-
ent from other kinds of divestment 
bills. The reason has to do with 
not only the context of the history 
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
but with the personal connection 
that many students on this campus 
have with this particular issue. As 
an Israeli Jew among those who are 
personally connected to this issue, I 
find the idea of having my student 
government voting to divest from 
companies doing business with 
Israel to be offensive and unfair.

There are various reasons as to 
why SJP’s divestment bill is prob-

surveillance of  campus protestors at 
uC davis calls into question just how far 

big brother’s been reaching.

Staging a protest for a cause is a part of the college experience, but recent rumors at UC Davis about 
the administration’s surveil-
lance tactics have caused dis-
sent among student protesters. 
In December 2010, students 
at Davis filed a report under 
the Freedom of Information 
Act and the California Public 
Records Act with the allegation 
that the administration was 
attempting to undermine and 
infiltrate their protest. 

The group acted in response 
to its discovery of the “Student 
Activism Response Team” — 
originally created in August 

2010 to supposedly protect 
student protesters during a pro-
test that would have blocked a 
highway. 

Consisting of 34 faculty 
members and administrators 
— many of them high rank-
ing authorities like Chancellor 
Katehi — the publicly funded 
program worked with the police 
to anticipate illegal student 
activity by tracking protests 
through Facebook events, emails 
and general body meetings. 

Members of the team 
regularly corresponded with 
the administration to alert each 
other about upcoming events. 
If a protest moved off campus, 
the administration would alert 
the police about the change in 
jurisdiction. 

It’s understandable that the 
administration would seek to 
quell dissent amongst student 
protesters. Still, researching 
protests online and infiltrating 
them by sending administrators 
to monitor the situation suggests 
that the administration wants to 
prevent something that is wrong 

or illegal, while the 
right to peaceful 
protest cannot 
be stifled by the 
heavy hand of 
the adminis-
tration. 

UC Davis’ 
Privacy 
Policy clearly 
states that 
any informa-
tion collected 
by the school 
includes “personal 
information such as 
name, date of birth, address, 
email address, telephone 
number(s) and/or educa-
tional interests. Such personal 
information may be requested 
for research, public service 
or teaching programs or for 
administrative purposes.” That 
policy is far too vague, opening 
the door to endless debate as to 
the meaning behind “adminis-
trative purposes” and “research.” 
It could stand to be based on 
more specific language, closing 
up ambiguities that could get 

students or the administra-
tion into a tight legal spot. 

The breach of privacy 
went beyond simple Facebook 
stalking — though the 280 
plus email records regarding 
Facebook profiles and events 
were a major component 

of the student’s grievances 
against the administration’s 
Big Brother power trip. Of 
course, the information 
that students choose to post 
up on Facebook is within 
the public domain, and it 
is certainly not illegal for 
administrators to obtain it. 
The main issue is that the 
UC Davis administrators did 
not stop just there. 

Administrators in the 
“Student Activism Response 
Team” were responsible for 
monitoring student activity, 
with the expectation that 
they would report dissent 
to Student Judicial Affairs, 
should any occur in order to 
enforce disciplinary action.

lematic.
However, I wish to focus on 

one reason that is one of the most 
relevant to the context in which 
this bill is taking place. Although 
many would suggest looking at the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict objetive-
ly, there are very many students on 
this campus who cannot help but 
view it on a personal level. 

While those in favor of the 
divestment bill view the IDF as 
an army that has committed war 
crimes and must be stripped of its 
weapons, there are those who fol-
low internationally-recognized 
human rights organizations that 
prove these claims false. 

Passing a bill that attempts to 
strip the IDF of its weapons sends a 
symbolic message which places the 
blame on that army for the ongoing 
violence in the region.

This idea goes against the views 
of many students that oppose this 
bill and believe that the IDF is act-
ing in self defense. For example, 
Israel held an operation in the 
Gaza Strip in 2008-09 to halt the 
Palestinian military groups from 
continuing to fire over 8,000 rock-
ets and mortars into Southern 
Israel. 

Considering the fact that many 
Israeli and pro-Israeli students on 
campus are personally and emo-
tionally affected by this rocket fire 

and rely on the IDF to prevent it, 
what right does the student govern-
ment have to pass a bill which dele-
gitimizes this army? 
ASUCSD should not favor one side 
of the student population over the 
other. 
       Due to the personal nature 
surrounding SJP’s divestment bill, 
students would be more likely to 
feel alienated on a personal level if 
it were to pass. 

It is time for students to under-
stand the divisive nature of this 
bill and to realize that those who 
are against it feel so because they 
wish to feel safe on their college 
campus. I personally am very much 
in favor of having students express 
their opinions freely without being 
judged for it, but I believe that 
there are some issues that have no 
place in the student government.

Additionally, they were required 
to have staff support at every major 
student protest. They formed a sup-
port team — which also included 
student leaders — whose main func-
tion was to point out safety risks to 
protesters and accompany the pro-
test, as well as maintain communica-
tion with administrators. 

According to Eric Lee, a UC 
Davis senior, the administra-
tion went as far as bringing in an 
undercover cop to participate in 
the protests. When asked about her 
position in the faculty, the cop lied 
and claimed that she was in the neu-
roscience department. The admin-
istration has since announced that 

all officers will no longer hide their 
identities, but it has not ruled out the 
possibility that such agents will be 
hired in the future.

The administration’s actions at 
UC Davis carry strong implications 
for students across the UC system. 
Instead of bringing in uniformed 
local police to protests, the response 
team chose instead to send in a sym-
bol of the administration’s distrust of 
student protesters. 

Griselda Castro, UC Davis 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs and team organizer, claims 
that “having a presence at student 
protests isn’t anything new” and 
that “we have not stopped activity. 
We have not infringed upon stu-

dents’ rights to express themselves.” 
But that presence doesn’t equate 
to bringing in undercover agents. 
While administrators may not have 
outright prevented students from 
expressing their opinion, such covert 
surveillance methods are far more 
unsettling than outright administra-
tive dissent.

Students at UCSD need to be 
vigilant about events occurring 
across other UC campuses in order 
to ensure that — especially given 
the events of last year’s “Compton 
Cookout” fiasco, which saw the 
largest protests on campus in over a 
decade — similar administrative sur-
veillance does not become an issue at 
our campus.

TONIGHT

Amidst the hell of midterms week, some people on planet Earth would like to remind us that things do 
get better and that life can have a happy 
ending, just like in the movies. William 
and Kate treated us to a fairy tale wed-
ding, and then, in the most recent turn of 
events, good triumphed over evil with the 
death of Bin Laden. But the reassurance 
is almost too easy, like a poorly-acted 
script predicated on wish fulfillment. 

First off: the Royal Wedding. The 
synopsis — that an everyday girl meets 
her prince — could have made a great 
Lifetime movie, except that it already 
did, and before the big event at that. (In 
case you missed the April 18 premiere 
of “William and Kate,” you can always 
find yourself a backordered copy of “The 
Prince and Me 2: The Royal Wedding.”) 

More than just a rehash of fairy tale 
romances, the Royal Wedding felt like 
a crappy remake of Charles and Diana’s 
1981 wedding. Really, though, William 
and Kate could have made the similari-
ties between the two weddings a little 
less obvious. They used the same engage-
ment ring and then restaged Charles and 
Diana’s kiss at Buckingham Palace. The 
fact that it took two kisses to get it right 
made the first seem too stiffly acted and 
obligatory to their fawning fans. 

The new royal couple is trying to 
mimic what Charles and Diana were for 
the world 30 years ago, but demurely and 
disingenuously.  I’m going to have to join 
Grace Van Cutsem, the three-year-old 
flower girl who held her hands up to 
cover her ears. This was one remake that 
should have gone straight to DVD.

Drawing the lines between the good 
and bad guys is just as easy as reducing a 
high-profile marriage to fairy tale tropes. 
Bin Laden’s death certainly is a resound-
ing victory for the Obama administration 
and our nation as a whole, but the eupho-
ria should be tempered with modesty. 

In the words of Martin Luther King, 
Jr., “Returning hate for hate multiplies 
hate, adding deeper darkness to a night 
already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot 
drive out darkness: only light can do that. 
Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can 
do that.” 

If there’s anything we’ve learned from 
movies, it’s to never let your guard down 
and put yourself in a false state of secu-
rity. Instead of poring over the details of 
one person’s death, it makes sense to push 
forward in resisting terrorism.

However much of a wish fulfillment 
the easy polarization of good and evil 
is, it’s still as comforting as believing 
that fairytale romances actually do exist. 
Both have the capacity to feed our hope 
for easier lives by creating the illusion 
of something perfect. Let’s face it: If the 
Royal Wedding was held a few years from 
now when Prince William would likely 
be totally bald, it just wouldn’t be the 
same. There’s a reason why we all forgot 
Prince Charles’s marriage to Camilla 
Parker-Bowles back in 2005. 

The current state of affairs seems like 
it came out of a movie script, but maybe 
it’s fine to indulge in them just for a 
little while. Though midterms stand as 
proof to the contrary, we’re still eager to 
believe in Hans Christian Andersen and 
his philosophy that “life itself is the most 
wonderful fairy tale,” even if it’s not hap-
pily ever after.

A Rusty
Hammer

Comic book flick has bright 
CGI, but little spark.

By Angela Chen

D irector Kenneth Branagh  — veteran of such works as “Much Ado About Nothing” and “Henry V”— doesn’t seem the right fit for this 
summer’s requisite comic book movie, “Thor,” the 

saga of a Norse god fighting to 
save humanity.

But a closer look reveals that 
his refined touch is evident in 
the film’s mix of high- and low-
brow: Although the big-budget 
flick features giant blue mon-
sters, rainbow sky bridges and 

an all-important magical object, its central tale 
of a brotherly struggle for power is more than a 
little Shakespearean. 

The premise is the age-old story of a son 
who needs to smarten up before taking his 
place on the throne. But the day of his coro-
nation, a few evil frost giants break into 
the palace, sending the chiseled 
blond god (Chris Hemsworth) 
into a blood-lust frenzy. He 
loses his head, starts a 
forbidden war and then 
gets stripped of his pow-
ers and banished to Earth. 
And that famous hammer 
— which looks more like a 
block of iron on a stick than 
a viable tool — buries itself in 
a rock that the SHIELD opera-

make 
up 

with 
the 

musica couple’s past inspires their new, driving sound. By taylor hogshead
J ohn Dragonetti and Blake Hazard, the couple who make up the Submarines, have a 
backstory befitting an indie rom-
com: The pair fell in love in Boston, 
moved to Los Angeles, broke up 
and then rekindled their romance 
through music — forming the band 
as a vehicle for songs that recall the 
heartache of their separation. 

Now, they’re married. Cue the 
“awwww’s.”

The band’s 2006 debut, Declare 
a New State!, is the result of these 
initial recording sessions — giving 
the album a dual perspective on 
their break-up. The duo’s follow-
up reveled in their relationship’s 
blissful resurgence, and the more 
upbeat — and instantly accessible 
— songs landed them spots on the 

soundtracks for “Gossip Girl” and 
“Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist,” 
among others.

And with several years of touring 
behind them, the couple has only 
gotten tighter (and more adorable). 
On a quick phone call from a pub 
rooftop in Dallas, Dragonetti and 
Hazard told the Guardian about life 
on the road and their new album. 

“I love the feeling of waking up 
in the morning and saying, “‘Wait, 
where am I?’” Hazard said. “It feels 
like you are super connected and 
disconnected to the world around 
you at the same time.”

There’s no Fleetwood Mac-style 
romantic drama on tour, either — 
the pair are happy as can be playing 
together every night.

 “It’s a total escape always,” 

Dragonetti said. “It’s very much like 
a vacation.” 

They’ve recently released their 
third album Love Notes/Letter 
Bombs, which marks an increased 
maturity in their sound and writ-
ing. The couple manages to sidestep 
the gooeyness often associated with 
bands composed of couples; in fact, 
on their latest, the duo avoided 
writing about their relationship alto-
gether. 

Nevertheless, Love Notes retains 
much of the twee spirit of their 
earlier work (for one, Dragonetti 
imagines the title as a scene between 
lovers from a Wes Anderson movie), 
though the duo has described the 
sound as harder hitting. 

“I wouldn’t call it aggressive, 
but it is more driving than the last 

record,” Hazard said. “I think it’s 
a [prettier] record. The highs are 
higher and the lows are lower.”

The band insists that their sound 
is mostly unaffected by their move 
across the country, though they’ve 
gained greater opportunity on the 
West Coast.

“After the last Submarines album, 
I felt like we felt more accepted 
into the greater music community,” 
Hazard said. “Being able to be played 
on KCRW and gaining that type 
of support made me more open. It 
gave me a fearlessness I’d never had 
before. I feel like I’ve been a little 
more opened up since moving to 
Los Angeles.”

The Submarines will be playing 
at the Loft this Friday, May 6 at 8:30 
p.m. Tickets are $10 at the box office. 



8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 5, 2011 HIATUS

tives are soon swarming over. 
On earth, Thor joins Jane Foster 

(Natalie Portman), a scientist trying 
to prove the existence of other worlds. 
Awkward complimenting and “don’t 
stop believing” conversations com-
mence. Meanwhile, back at Asgard, 
the CGI-created home of the gods, 
Thor’s jealous brother Loki (Tom 
Hiddleston) seizes power.

Branagh has the challenge of pro-
moting a lesser-known superhero, 
but the movie rises to the occasion by 
having characters voice their incre-
dulity (lots of “Oh my God, is this 
happening?”) before the audience can 
mockingly think the same. 

So, interspersed with scenes of a 
fire-spewing “Destroyer” annihilating 
most of a New Mexico town, are bits 
of comic relief mostly drawing from 
Thor’s cultural faux pas, whether it’s 
smashing a cup because he wants 
another drink or strutting into a pet 
store to demand a horse. The side plot 
with Portman’s character is refreshing 
for the comic book genre, as it focuses 
on the idea of science as capable of 
explaining magic.

But while Hemsworth is appro-
priately muscled and Portman is in 
her element as the shy, smart girl, 
the chemistry between them falls 
flat because the interactions are too 
rushed; one car drive and late-night 
conversation do not an everlasting 
romance make.

The real star of the movie is the 
world of Asgard: The fantasy abode 
is a CGI masterpiece, all sleek golden 
buildings and starry views with a sky 
bridge that’s an icy marvel jutting into 
an endless expanse of infinity. The 
special effects provide more depth 
than the story itself, which seems to 
have opted for having the most stu-
dio-friendly running time rather than 
the most well-rounded story.

FILMREVIEW

L et’s just start with the obvious pun here: “Something Borrowed,” the latest in the bride-to-be rom-com bunch to hit the-
aters this spring, borrows a hell of a lot. It bor-

rows stars from more enter-
taining TV shows (Ginnifer 
Goodwin from “Big Love” 
and Jon Krasinski from 
“The Office”), it borrows 
sort-of stars from less 
entertaining TV shows 
(Colin Egglesfield of the 
short-lived “Melrose Place” 
remake) and it borrows its 
plot from an Emily Giffin 

chick-lit paperback of the same name. Of 
course, there’s a lot of borrowing from other 
movies (namely, “My Best Friend’s Wedding”), 
but we don’t expect much more from a warm 
weather estrogen fest. 

Like the aforementioned Julia Roberts 
flick, “Something Borrowed” follows mousy 
brunette Rachel (Goodwin), the generously 
loyal best friend to party girl/bombshell Darcy 
Rhone (Kate Hudson). On Rachel’s 30th 
birthday, the successful (and terminally single) 
NYC attorney slips into bed with her law 
school crush, Dex Thaler (Colin Egglesfield), 
who also happens to be Darcy’s fiancé.   

As Rachel struggles with her friendship 
with Darcy, her deepening feelings for Dex 
(who might as well be a cardboard cutout) 
and his anxiety over which girl to choose, the 
tangle of relationships goes from complicated 
to downright confusing. Rachel’s longtime 
confidant Ethan Tremblay (John Krasinski) 
has a secret crush of his own while being 
stalked by Claire (Ashley Williams), and 
Dex’s womanizing best friend Marcus (Steve 
Howey) can’t keep his hands to himself.   

“Do you think I should marry Dex, 
because I do love him… I think,” Darcy pon-
ders in a gratingly indecisive monologue that, 

unfortunately, characterizes the entirety of the 
film. 

The way in which each character manipu-
lates the others with no regard for the emo-
tional destruction she wreaks renders each 
of them unlikable. In contrast to her fashion-
forward New York styling, Darcy’s a pretty 
crass gal, and any sympathy we might have 
for her as the victim of Dex and Rachel’s affair 
quickly disappears.

The whole ensemble cast, in fact, is hardly 
appealing: The New Yorkers spend practically 
all their time eating at Shake Shack (all the 
product placement for this Madison Square 
Park eatery is just absurd) and partying at a 
beach-front condo, where Hudson plays the 
tipsy queen bee with concerning realism. 
Not even Tom Cruise look-alike Egglesfield 
can wrangle much likability from this tepid 
screenplay, though he and Goodwin boast 
some borderline convincing chemistry.   

As the film bounces from the big city to 
pretentious get-togethers in the Hamptons, 
the only relief is Krasinski’s charming Ethan, 
who — like his character Jim in “The Office” 
— shoots mocking faces at the rest of the 
cast. The Hamptons are, Ethan complains, “a 
zombie movie directed by Ralph Lauren.” That 
setup, incidentally, sounds a whole lot more 
enticing than this one.

Overdue Rental
A rehashed plotline lands capable actors in 

rom-com hell. By Kelly Hill

F leet Foxes are an easy band to dislike. With their particular brand 
of coffee shop-friendly 
folk pop providing a 
launch pad for a slew of 
dreadfully annoying main-
stream acts (Mumford & 
Sons, anyone?), you’d be 
forgiven for tiring of their 
aesthetic. 

At first listen, the 
Foxes’ sophomore record, 
Helplessness Blues, does 
little to dispel those appre-
hensions. Opening track 
“Montezuma” is perhaps 
the most unassuming way 
the band could have begun 
the record: Over conven-
tional acoustic plucking, 
singer Robin Pecknold 
coos about the uncertainty 
of growing older.

In lesser hands, the 
song could be little more 
than Mumford-level wank-
ery, but the band treats the 
song with a sense of tex-
ture and space that is both 
refreshing and indicative 
of the album’s overall suc-
cess.

 Though the band 
sticks to many of the 
same elements that made 
their debut so charming 
(gorgeous vocal harmo-
nizing and mandolins), 
Helplessness Blues differs 
greatly in feel. For one 
thing, it’s jammier than its 
predecessor, tending more 

toward spacious, snow-
balling grooves than con-
cise, three-minute bundles 
of melody. On tracks 
like “The Plains/Bitter 
Dancer,” the approach 
is executed wonderfully 
— the delicate melodies 
are still there, but they’re 
accompanied by a driving, 
jazzy rhythmic section 
that creates a sense of 
momentum largely absent 
on the band’s debut.

Similarly, “Bedouin 
Dress” pairs hummable 
strings with rolling, scat-
tered percussion that 
wouldn’t sound out of place 
on one of Joni Mitchell’s 
mid-seventies records, 
while the phenomenal title 
track sounds like a tradi-
tional folk hymn, offering 
an ecstatic meditation on 
the wilderness.  

For better or worse, 
it looks like Fleet Foxes 
are here to stay. With 
Helplessness Blues, they’ve 
confirmed their preemi-
nence over the legion of 
wool-sweatered folk bands 
that have overrun the 
modern indie scene. And 
justly so: Helplessness Blues 
is one of the richest, most 
rewarding folk albums 
released since the Foxes’ 
2008 debut.

SPORTS THURSDAY, MAY 5, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

small scholarships. Every sport but the 
main ball sports would be underfunded, 
and staying D-II for these teams would 
be more beneficial than going D-I with 
only partial funding. 

Purely from the athletic side, we 
need to go D-I fully funded or not at 
all —  for the integrity of our history of 
athletic performance and our dignity, as 
a partially funded program will not give 
us the results we are looking for.

In the Big West, we will be competing 
against schools that can get athletes in 
who are not on academic par with the 
rest of the student body. UCSD won’t 
compromise in this area, and I cannot 
blame them. But what this means is that 
we will be trying to take athletes away 
from institutions such as Stanford and 
Berkeley. The fully-funded sports will be 
able to do this, or at least have a fighting 
chance. 

UCSD’s academic reputation is ris-
ing, and our teams would doubtless 
rise to meet the challenge. We did it in 
our move from D-III to D-II in 2000. 
In track, we became the best in the 
CCAA year after year, winning mul-
tiple conference titles. Our baseball team 
has made several NCAA College World 
Series appearances. Our women’s track 
team has placed third nationally, while 
the baseball team finished second just 
last season. 

These feats are outstanding. Our suc-
cess is widespread, with good coaching 
that makes skill sports excel with our 
highly intellegent athletes. We could do 
this in D-I, but we need the scholarships 
to do so.

This is because there is a huge leap in 
athleticism from D-II to D-I. The ath-
letes at the D-I level are simply freaks. 
You know UCSD athletes and you know 
San Diego State athletes. Take a second 
and compare the athletic talent on the 
SDSU basketball team with the talent 

on ours. Don’t get me wrong: our team 
is technically superb, but they’re not 
throwing alley-oops to our point guard 
on a nightly basis. 

In track and field, the women’s team 
from last year would have been fifth in 
the Big West. The men’s team would be 
dead last. In the CCAA, the team was 
second in both genders. But, that was 
the best women’s team and best men’s 
team in our history, without question. 
To put our program in the Big West 
without the scholarships we need would 
be suicide for many teams. We would 
still have a few good athletes every now 
and then, but the base would still be 
technically adept athletes, and we would 
have to resign ourselves from getting 
serious athletes that can get better schol-
arship from a school such as UCLA or 
Stanford. 

So which would you rather see? Do 
you want a half-done D-I program, a la 
UC Riverside or UC Santa Barbara? Do 
you want a terrifying program that truly 
defines sports in the NCAA, as seen at 
UCLA or Cal? You, the student, need to 
speak up for full funding for all sports, 
or no move to D-I at all. 

You can speak with your words to 
the administration and to incoming A.S. 
Council President Alyssa Wing. Next 
fall, you can speak louder by approving a 
small increase in student fees that could 
make our D-II tradition of winning 
translate into D-I dominance. The exact 
dollar amount hasn’t yet been decided, 
so it is imperative to fight for full fund-
ing to be on the ballot. Otherwise, we are 
wasting our time. 

Speak up, be loud, be proud and push 
Triton Athletics toward the program you 
want to see in 10 years or 20 years. Then 
you can give a proud answer when your 
kids ask, “Hey dad, mom, didn’t you go 
to UCSD?” when they see our teams 
beating Stanford, UCLA, Berkeley, Texas 
and USC into the ground.

Partial Funding of  Scholarships 
Could Cause Some Sports to Stagnate 
▶ HOWE, from page 12

Baseball
The Tritons have already guaranteed 

themselves an eighth consecutive appearance 
in the four-team CCAA tournament, but the 
other three spots are undecided, and seed-
ing is still up for grabs. The current top four 
teams in the conference — UCSD, Chico 
State, Cal State San Bernardino and Sonoma 
State — all face each other this weekend, with 
UCSD in a home-and-home series with San 
Bernardino and Chico and Sonoma clashing 
in a similar series on the same dates.

Cal Poly Pomona and Cal State LA are 
lurking in the fifth and sixth spots, but will 
face off in a four-game series this weekend — 
leaving various possibilities for how things 
might play out, though there are a few that 
would be best for UCSD.

First, UCSD is coming off a convincing 
sweep of Chico last weekend, and would 
most likely be more than happy to play the 
Wildcats again. If Chico can win one game, 
it should be in, and would face the Tritons in 
the first round.

Second, the Tritons dropped three of four 
to Cal State LA earlier this season, and could 
provide upset potential in the CCAA tour-
nament. UCSD should root for Pomona to 
keep it out of the postseason, or else beating 
San Bernardino enough times this weekend 
could allow CSULA to sneak in.

Finally, and perhaps most obviously, 
UCSD would like to secure the top spot. 
Coming into the postseason off a series win 
can give a team a boost in the tournament, 
too, and will pair the top squad with the low-
est seed in the tournament. UCSD can clinch 
the top spot with one more win. 

UCSD has, however, won 13 straight 
since April 9, and certainly looks like a 
better-oiled machine than earlier in the sea-
son.  Pitching at the back end of the rotation 
remains a question, but the Tritons have 
enough talent to get past whoever they face 
in the CCAA tournament, held May 12-14 in 
Stockton, Calif.

TriTons Take conference TiTle, advance To naTionals

By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

CREW — The UCSD men’s crew team will 
advance to the national championships for the 
second time in program history, after a fantastic 
showing at the Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships last weekend. The 
Tritons got two first-place finishes to take home 
the conference title. 

The two-day event, held in Gold River, Calif., 
requires teams to qualify in races on Saturday 
for either grand final or petite final races on 
Sunday. UCSD qualified seven boats in total for 
the Sunday races.

The varsity eight boat was the star of Sunday’s 

race, as the Tritons took first in their final race, 
beating out Gonzaga by a boat length — just over 
one second. UCSD finished the 2k race in 5:52.6, 
with the Bulldogs trailing at 5:53.8. UCLA fin-
ished a distant third at 5:58.3.

The Tritons got their second win from the 
junior varsity ‘A’ boat, which beat out Orange 
Coast College and Gonzaga to finish in 6:04.3 and 
take the win. UCSD’s junior varsity ‘B’ boat took 
fourth in the race.

The novice eight boat took home a third-place 
finish in 6:11.7, finishing behind winners Orange 
Coast College and Gonzaga. 

Men’s head coach Zach Johnson was named 
WIRA Coach of the Year for the third consecutive 
year after Sunday’s final race.

The Tritons will now compete in 
the Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships in Camden, N.J. from June 2-4.

The women’s team had a trio of fourth-place 
finishes in Sunday’s races. The varsity eight was 
fourth in the petite final, finishing in 7:06.4. UC 
Santa Barbara took first in 6:56.6. The novice four 
boat took fourth in their grand final, coming in at 
8:30.6. The lightweight four boat finished in 8:26.0 
to take the Tritons’ last fourth-place finish.

The University of San Diego varsity eight 
boat turned in the best women’s time of the day 
at 6:31.1.

Readers can contact Liam Rose at lfrose@ucsd.

The Triton varsity eight boat won its race in 5:52.6, coming in ahead of Gonzaga and UCLA. The Tritons now advance to the national championships in Camden, N.J. from June 2-4.

Nostalgia is a powerful emo-tion. As a UCSD student grinding away to make the 
grade, you’ll soon look back upon 
your time here with a sigh as you get 
neck-deep in the real life struggles of 
work and family. 

For those of us in sports, our alma 
maters remind us of our crazy college 
days, and give us pride as we attend 
blue-gold games and homecomings 
and check up on how our old teams 
are doing. My dad, a UC Riverside 
basketball and track star, still keeps 
up with his teams no matter how bad 
they are, and wears his old jerseys 
around the house on Saturdays. 

For him, it’s really cool to see his 
school in the NCAA Division I when 
it used to be a Division-II school that 
competed in the CCAA — the same 
conference as UCSD. I now find 
myself in a position similar to my 
father’s. UCSD has the opportunity 
to go D-I — but at what cost?

Let’s review the situation. For nos-
talgic purposes, seeing your school in 
a D-I conference, most likely the Big 
West, will give you a huge boost in 
pride and might also help make your 
alma mater more recognizable on 
a job application. But there are also 
some issues that the new initiative 
has brought up that I urge you to 
consider. 

The Division-I feasibility study 
released in March, as we knew was 
likely, nixed football altogether. In 
today’s economy, the exorbitant bud-
get required for football would call 
the student body to riot. Further, that 
amount of money would smother 
every other sports team and kill our 
proud athletic program. To be blunt, 
football is not a reality now or in the 
next 50 years. Sorry.

The funding for Division I is the 
biggest issue at stake. There are three 
options on the table: Go D-I fully 
funded, go D-I with partial funding, 
or stay D-II. 

Fully funded across-the-board 
D-I would mean that each team we 
have gets its full amount of schol-
arship money through the student 
body. Right now, UCSD is competi-
tive in D-II, with only $260,000 in 
scholarships. The recommended 
increase is around $3.3 million 
according to the report, which is 
taking the second option of partial 
funding. 

The main ball sports, such as bas-
ketball and baseball, would receive 
massive boosts in scholarship money, 
while other sports would receive only 
modest gains. This means that rather 
than the 12.6 and 18 scholarships the 
track & field program could have — 
the maximum amount allowed by 
the NCAA for men’s and women’s 
teams, respectively — it would only 
receive 1.5 and 2.  In contrast, base-
ball would move from its current 
0.88 scholarships to 11, and both 
men’s and women’s basketball would 
move to the maximum amount.

There are 40 or more members on 
a track team, and that’s not including 
cross country, which shares these

The UCSD track and field team will travel to Cal State Stanislaus for the CCAA 
Championships this weekend in 
hopes of continuing its record-setting 
performance from last year. Both the 
men’s and women’s teams finished 
second last season, which was the 
highest ever on the men’s side.

The conference is one of the best 
in the nation, and Chico State will 
look to retain the championship on 
both the men’s and women’s sides. 

“Chico’s going to be hard to beat 
on both sides,” men’s head coach 
Tony Salerno said. “As good as we are, 
there are a couple of other teams in 
the conference — Pomona, Cal State 
LA — that have improved dramati-
cally.”

UCSD should have a slew of event 
winners, but Chico’s ability to stock-
pile points in some events with mul-
tiple point-scoring athletes — espe-
cially in the distance events — will 
make the Wildcats tough to bring 
down. 

The Tritons do, however, have 
points guaranteed in some areas, with 
athletes such as Kelly Fogarty and 
Stephanie LeFever set to dominate 
their respective events. As a team, 
though, UCSD would need an excep-
tional day from many of the fringe 
players to take home a title, with a 
second- or third-place finish more 
likely.

“Historically, our athletes compete 
better at the conference meet than 
other teams,” Salerno said. “I think 
part of that is the exposure our ath-
letes get to high-level competition.”
