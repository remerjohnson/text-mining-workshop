Plans for SO Offshore 
Oil Drilling Fought 

By Dorothy Houston 
Staff Writer 

The United States Depart-
ment of Interior's plans to lease 
areas offshore of San Diego for 
011 and gas drilling met mostly 
opposition at public hearing 
downtown last week before 
members of the Department. 

Un der debate was Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS) 
"Lease Sale 48, " an Interior-
designated area of 217 tracts 
encompassing more than a 
million acres from Mexico to 
Santa Barbara. Of these tracts , 
26 are within 6-18 miles of San 
Diego shores. 

Environmental groups and 
unaffiliated citizens opposed all 
offshore driUings plans as a 
threat to the marine environ-
ment. Local congressmen, city 
offic ials and businessman 
opposed the plans to drill close 
to shore, charging that po-
tential oil spills would endanger 
San Diego's tourist industry. 

San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson 
told the Department that any 
impact on "our billion dollar 
tourism industry would amount 
to a flirtatlo~ with economic 
disaster." 

Offshore oil drilling can add ' 
to air pollution levels a 
hydrocarbons are released in 
the transfer of oil to tankers. 
San Diego exceeded federal air 
P<JHutioh standards 109 days in 
1977. T~e Environmental 
Protection Agency has given 
San Diego notice that federal 
air quality standards will be 
prerequisite to San Diego 
gaining federal funds (or 
expanded sewage treatment 
facilities as required by the 
Federal Clean Water Act. 

"We face the irony of a 
federal agency demanding 
action on one side while another' 
(ederal agency moves ahead 
with its oil lease sale," Wilson 
said. 

The National benefit to be 
realized from drilling of oil 
close to San Diego, Wilson said, 
is insufficient to offset the 
threat of damage that might 
occur to the environment and 
economy. A , Draft Environ-
mental Statement (DES) 
drawn up by the department on 
drilling in the Southern Cali-
fornia tracts estimated that the 
oil gained from the near shore 
tracts off of San Diego would 

supply 36 hours of the national 
oil need. 

Each of five children of the 
Zoune family of Ocean Beach 
read an essay he or he had 
WrItten before the Department. 
Lisa Zounes said she had met 
her " boyfriend at the beach" 
and If it were " wrecked 
teenager wouldn't go down 
there." Their mother, Mary 
Ann Zounes, brought along a 
piece of tar she had found on the 
beach and said he wished she 
could tie it to the EIS. 

OCS drilling sites have been 
proposed for most offshore 
areas of the United States. 
Secretary of the Interior Cecil 
Andrus will announce next 
March whether or not the 
proposed Lease Sale 48 will be 
offered for lease. 

The DES was highly criti-
cized at the hearings as being 
deficient in its analysis of 
geological data of the tracts 
and in its analysis of the 
economic impacts on San Diego 
industry.

McElroy Revises 
Hazards Group 

By Doug Campion 
Science Editor 

Chancellor William McElroy 
is currently restructuring the 
committee which determines 
the policy regarding recom-
binant DNA experimentation 
on campus. 

The Biohazards Committee 
was established last year by 
McElroy' in light of the many 
possible dangers presented by 
genetic experimentation. Ac-
cording to Don Sites, Associate 
Vice Chancellor in charge of 
Facilities Management , the 
committee's authority was to 
examine "not the content of an 
experiment, but whether or not 
it could be done safely." 

This year, however, as a 
result of some of the appointed 
professors being on leaves of 
absence, and others having 
obligations which draw their 
time and attention from bio-
hazards, the group's 18 mem-
bers are unable to carry out 
their duties as originally 
outlined. 

The new committee will 
consist of orUy six members' -
three faculty professors , a 
person from the Mayor's 
Committee on the Quality of 
Life, one graduate student who 

JeOlZealOle in the field of 

recombinant DNA and a non-
Ph.D. staff member, as sug-
gested in the advisory guide-
lines delineated last ye~ . by the 
National Institutes oi IIealth 
(NIH). McElroy is presently 
awaiting advice from the 
Academic Senate regarding 
possible qualified appointees to 
the committee. 

"If the faculty feel they need 
more representation in there, I 
have no problem with that; we 
can put more on," said McEL-
roy. " But the way a small 
committee usually works is 
they'll work up a list of 
consultants and then if they 
an application for recombinant 
DNA work and they don't feel 
qualified (to evaluate it) . 
they'll go to one of the consul-
tants." This list of advisors 
drawn up by the committee 
would not only contain names 
researchers from the 
sity, •. but there could 
community people involved, 
too," said McElroy. 

During the process of or-
ganizing the new committee. 
any necessary policy Ut:l:JliUIU:i1 
in the field of gen tic 
bination will be made by the 
available members of the 
group formed last year.

speed of impulse (cycles per 
second) and the amplitude or 
voltage strength ofthe impulse. 

Beta waves occur during 
wakefulness when the brain is 
actively perceiving through the 
five physical senses of sight, 
smell, touch, taste and hearing. 
The next lower level of brain 
frequency is a'lpha, the desired 
lftate for mind control, in which 
the brain is not processing 
visual information. Theta and 
delta are associated with 
deeper levels of consciousness. 
Theta and delta are associated 
with deeper levels of conscious-
ness, sleep and unconscious 
brain activity. Whereas beta 
levels are often equated with 
physical tasks, anxiety and 
problem solving, alpha is 
considered a state of relaxation 

and meditation, conducive to 
creativity, learning and intuit-
ion. 

Neher then explained that 
psychorientology , or mind 
control, is.the study of orienting 
the mind at the alpha level of 
brain activity and learning to 
function in this dimension. This 
theory was developed by Jose 
Silva, a self-educated Mexican-
American who . first began 
research in this field in 1944. 

While working with children 
to see if their I .Q. factors could 
be increased, Silva noticed a 
startling phenomenon: They 
were answering questions 
before the question were a ked. 
Sliva found that subjects with 
this ability were in a particular 
tate of mind, not the normal 

beta, but in alpha, what he now 
calls the " Inner Conscious." 

Silva spent 26 year and 
about a half million dollars 
developing a m'ind control 
technique. Clas es were offer-
ed in 1966 with a guarantee that

Marijuana

I wish to vocalize a complaint 

regarding existing marijuana

My growing marijuana plants

consumption is ih no way

a~reements yesterday. 

" We·ve. alerted people and 
told them we hope to print 
tomorrow," Times Managing 
Editor Seymour Topping said 
yesterday. 

The lone stumbling block to a 
resumption of publication was 
the Newspaper Guild, which 
ca lled a strike against the 
Times on Saturday. The union, 
however, also appeared close to 
settling its dispute. 

Meanwhile, ratification votes 
were being taken yesterday on 
tentative pacts with four 
unions, representing stereo-
typers. pressmen, paperhan-
dlers and machinists.

Above all, students are urged 
to practice the Sliva Mind 
Control techniques. Silva said, 
"SMC abilities improve only 
with constant practice." 

Neher emphasized that mind 
control does not involve hypno-
sis; "In hypnosis you turn 
yourself over to the hypnotist. 
In our system, we repeat over 
and over that the subject is his 
own boss." Mind control is an 
attempt to consciously fllnction 
at these lower levels of brain 

activity. levelll at whl,.h one i. 
normally subcoocsiouslyoronly 
unconscious aware. 

One student explained it as 
follows: "TllrouJb meditation -
- Mind Control calla it 'reachilll 
your level' - you achieve a state 
of alpha consciousness. There's 
nothin, mysterious about that. 
But tbe difference between 
Mind Control and otber forms 
of meditation Is tbat once 
you're a& your level, instead of 
just sittin, there doilll nothin, 
(al in traditional meditation) 
you work." 

"Work" Includes everytbin, 
from projectln, yourself into 
the body of another penon and 
diagnosiog his Illnesses to 
controllin, habits such as 
smoking and overeating. 

According to Neber, mind 
control brings about definite, 
significant and valuable chan-
ges - specifically in the areas of 
relaxation, psycbosomatics , 
self-improvement and problem 

solving. One of the most notable 
differences in almost eyery 
graduate of SMC ia the im-
provement of ,rades in school. 
Neber said thai all students do 
better on tests aDd are much 
more relaxed In school. 

"Man's mind ia limitless," 
say. Silva. "Conscious control 
of the subconscious and peace 
that passes all undentanding 
al known by Cbrlstian- and 
Hebrew mystics, Sufis, Yogis 
and Zen masters - all thia is 
now available to' the Western 
culture. It ia hilbly 'essential 
that we train all human beings 
to use the alpha region of the 
brain to become luperior 
human beings. We can really 
start makin, this planet a 
better world to live in."

Currently on campus, re-
combinant DNA research is 
ongoing at tile Muir Biology 
Building, BoMer Hall and the 

McElroy stressed that "the .Basic Sciences Building. 
whole thing is set up using the , • 
NIH guidelines." 

The NIH classifies labora-
tory facilities according to their 
confinement capabilities . 
Those used for the least 
threatening of recombinant 
DNA experiments are labeled 
"Pl." The ranking proceeds up 
to "P4," for use In the most 
potentially dangerous re-
search. 

There are currently two 
facilities under construction on 
University property - one at 
Bonner Hall and one at Uni-
versity Hospltal- as well as an 
already completed researcb 
laboratory in the new Medical 
Teaching Facility building on 
the campus of the Medical 
School. Each of these will be 
used for recombinant DNA 
research, and .according to 
McElroy, "These are all Pas."

In addition to handling the 
policy ·concerning genetic 
research, the new Biohazards 
Committee may be saddled 
with the responsibility of 
dealing with what McElroy 
called ~ 'a bigger problem." 
That is, . they may be asked to 
make policy decisions reo 
gardlng the chemical hazards 
on campus. McElroy explained 
that this added authority would 
necessitate the Involvement of 
" people who have different 
qualifications .. . who could 
worry about various chemicals 
in the laboratories - in the 
student labs as weU as In the 
research labs ." He added. 
"Whether that (the Biohaz-
ards) committee handles all of 
that bag of·worms is something 
that has to be decided, because 
it's a bigjobin .jtself. We'rejust 
havin, under consideration 
now the possibility of ap-

Judic,ial ' Drilling Safe, Compan·ies Say 
Candidates 
Debate 
Issues 

By Ka&llerlne Hafner 
A forum for Judicial Can. 

d idates sponsored by the 
League of Women Voters 
deteriorated into an informaJ 
ga thering last wednedsay 
night, during which the can-
dida tes discussed various 
topics they must frequently 
deal with. 

One of the most "discussed' 
topics of the evening was that of 
battered wives. Both incum-
bent Judge Mary Gell and her 
challenger Marge Stein ex-
pressed strong views. Judge 
Gell stressed the importance of ' 
getting both wife and husband 
into a Domestic Relations 
Conciliation court. An alter-
native to pressing criminal 
charges, this special recon-
ciliation process offers psy-
chological belp to the family 
members involved. 

Municipal court Judge David 
Gill, vying for a position in the 
Superior Court, also expressed 
concern over the battered 
women question. " The laws 
need to be changed, but we 
can't do that. They have to do 
that in Sacramento." The 
courts, he said, should be 
immediately accessible to the 
beaten wives. When asked how 
various factors enter into a 
deciSion, be responded that it ia 
very important to dismiss one's 
penonal biases when acting as 
an arbitrator in any court 
Proceedings. 

Presiding Judge Bob Cooney 
said that he was not interested 
in a question about battered 
women specUically. "I don 't 
even consider a battered 
women question. It's a battered 
people question. No violence of 
any sort should be tolerated. 
Woman, man, child, or other-
wise." 

Incumbent muniCipal court 
Judge David Moon expressed 
concern over the great number 
of charges brought into court as 
misdemeanors, which require 
an attorney and jury. " This is 
too costly," said Judge Moon. 
"Many of these misdemeanors 
could just as easily be brought 
to court as infractions which 
just involve a fine." An~ther oC 
his concerns was the over-
crowding in the County's jails. 
He said, " There is no way 
possible to incarcerate the huge 
~umber of drunks that come 
IOto court everyday." He said 
he is often forced to just throw 
them out onto the street again. 

Another question posed to the 
candidates was: Would you 
suggest an alternative to our 
present system of selecting and 
re~aining judges? When asked 
thIS, most of tbe candidates 
res ponded that they. were 
content with the present 
system, under wbichjudges are 
elected for six-year terms on a 
nonpartisan ballot by voters of 
their district. 

Although in favor of the 
present system of elections, aU 
of the candidates said they 
were tired and that tbeir money 
and energy was completely 
spent. Several didn ' t even 
attend the Forum. Judge Gill 
said, " I've boutht all the radio 
and TV time J can, done all that ~ POSSibly can. Now all I can do 
IS wait. The election milbt Just 
as well tab pla<.'e tomorrow." 

(Coalbaued from page I) 
zation, said the DES reads like 

a."text~k because it'slongon 
dISCUSSIon of what is known 
about the coastal environment 
and economy but little dis-
cussion on the interaction of 
that environment and oil 
development. " 

He added that the DES should 
be called the " Oil Lea se 
Justification Statement" and 
not the DES. 

T:le DES is preUminary to the 
final Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS) . Under the 
National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 AMEIS is requirerl 
for every major action a 
federal agency takes regarding 
the environment. 

Manager of Environmental 
Programs with Chevron Oil 
Forrest Smith, representing 
tbe Western Oil and Gas 
ASSOCiation, said there haven't 

been any oil spill problems in 
Southern California since the 
1969 Santa Barbara incident. 
Projections for Cuture offshore 
spill~g-:s, he said, are overly 
peSSImIstic because of a Ca ilure 
~o .. account for continuing 
Improvements in oil drilling 
technology , operating pro-
cedu~s and safety measures." 

Smith added t~t California

.JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION 
A representative will be at 

Graduate/Professional Information Day 
from 10:00 Lm. to 3:00 p.m. 

on Tuesday, November 7,1978 
to answer questioDs and discuss 

the features of a oareer in 
COURTAD~TRAnON 

, skyline proJected onto the 
curtain behind the sta,e. but a 
dynamite aaxopbone solo in the 
best biues traditioo by Rickie 
Cannata. who drew almost as 
many cheers for his playin, as 
Joel. 

Cannata was the most promi-
nent member of Joel's band. 
also playing keyboards. flute 
and percussion when not 
blowing tbe audience away 
with his sax. 

When Joel was in the spot-
light he almost never kept still. When be bad to stay at the piano 
during more eDeJ'letic 8ODI8. 
he was,eaturinI with his bands 
every second that they weren't 
required on tbe keyboard. 
indulging particularly in his 
habit of actin, out what the 
lyrics of his songs were des-
cribing. Tbis was amusing 
most of the time and particu-
larly inventive on several 
occasions. such as when he had 
his necktie serve as a noose 
when a reference to hanging 
came up in the lyrics. His feet 
were also in constant motion. 
dancing and kicking around the 
pedals when his adrenalin got 
_inlt. 

The only negative aspect of 
the sbow didn't have anything 
to do with Joel or his band. but 
was rather the responsibility of 
the Sports Arena management. 
All through the show. mucb to 
my disbeUef and annoyance. 
concessionaires kept walking 
by hawking soft drinks. Ap-
parently the Sp.orts Arena 
management doesn't realize 
that Billy Joel is not the San 
Diego Hawks. and that people 
pay $1.50 a ticket to watch the 
performer. not a troop of 
abrasiye soft drink sellers. 

It was a tribute to Joel and his 
band that the high quality of 
their show kept tbese an-
noyances from weighing too 
heavily on the mind. for the 
performance was truly excel-
lent. Everything about it. from 
Joel's excellent vocals and top-
rate songs to the uninhibited 
theatrics and preCise split-
second light chan,es. added up 
to an overwhelminaly enjoy-
able concert experience - good 
enough for the audience to call 
Joel back for five encores. 

This particular Entertainer 
may still silll. "And I won't be 
here in another yearl If (don't 
stay on the charts." but if he 
keeps ,Ivllll sbows Uke this 
one. he won't have any trouble 
selllni records.

of victories over UC Riverside 
and Cal State Loa An,eles this 
weekend. 

Tbe Riverside Hi,Manders 
visited the natatorium Friday. 
in a match-up between the two 
UC teams. Riverside systema-
tically built a 3-2 lead midway 
tbrou,b the first quarter. but 
UCSD fast-breaked their way to 
a S-3 advantage at the end of the 
period, a lead they would never 
cede. 

Gre, Maletls rifled in one 
goal that period and two in the 
second quarter, to lead the 
team's scorin, in the half. 
Shadlnl his eyes from the

Willy Morris and tbe tight 
pressure of the rest of the squad 
teamed up to sbut out the 
Riverside attack. and lead 8-3 
at halftime. 

Maletts added two more 
scores In the third period. 
uppin, bis total to five. Marlt 
Gorda lofted a flawless lob shot 
over the Riverside goalle into 
the corner of the goal for 
another point . The Triton 
defense was run over for four 
goals that . quarter. however. 
and five the next . 

That wasn't sufficient to stop

Tom Jorgensen. Kai Loedel. 
Tracy Patrick. Dan Crane, Jim 
Sem, Tom Enger. MaieUs and 
Gordon) contributed ,oals to 
the team effort. 

The shooting of Maletis and 
Gordon added a new dimension 
to the UCSD offense. which 
usually consists of fast break 
scoring and individuals driving 
on the hole. MaleUs is the first 
player to effectively score from 
outside the four meter mark. 
"He's ,ot the stronllest arm on 
the team. " said the Triton 
coach. 

Gordon. twice stuck in the

other score in the first half also. 
Gordon did not score once in the 
entire seven game road trip up

Triton coach called that a 
rna jor f!lctor in their 3-4 record.

Stack led the men foilists to a 6-
3 decision, while Wuif Carson 
and Ed Amos fenced "very 
well" to give UCSD a 7·2 victory 
in the epee event. But vjctories 
in tbese two weapons were not 
enough to overcome defeat, as 
the women foilists and men 
saberists were both beaten 
soundly by identical scores of 8· 
I , giving the Fullerton team a 
21·15 victory. 

In the second match. aided by 
a forfeit in the foil event and 
some perfect fencing in the 
epee event, UCSD trounced 
CSULA, 23-13. 

The epeeists, who fenced 
strongly the whole day, did not 
lose a single decision to Cal 
State LA as they recorded a 
perfect 9-0 route. The forfeit by · 
LA's foilists gave UCSD ao 
automatic 9-0 decision, and 
though the women foilists and 
men saberists were both 
defeated, UCSD still gained ao 

. overall victory. 
The women fared slightly 

better in this match, as did the 
men saberists, but both came 
up on the short end, the former 
losing by a score of 7·2, the 
latter by a 6-3 margin.
