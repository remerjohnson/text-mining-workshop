The struggles of a young NIcaragua 
By MARlKO TAKAYASU, Capitol Correspondent 

MANAGUA, Nicaragua -
Spring break is over for 
Nicaragua's university students. 
None of them went to Fort 
Lauderdale, Palm Springs or 
Puerto Vallarta. 

Instead, they packed their 
bags and headed for the coffee 
plantations in northern 
Nicaragua where they lived and 
worked with the peasants, or 
campesinos, from sun up to sun 
down . 

"It gives us a chance to learn 
about the lives of the 
campesinos," said Tamara, a 21 
year old language student at the 
National University of Nicaragua. 

Although the work is 
voluntary, the majority of t~e 
students don 't hesitate to help 
during the coffee harvest. To 
them , it's a continuation of the 
1979 revolution and efforts 
needed to help rebuild the 
ountrv. Tamara said . 

Few of the students at the 
National University are more 
than 25 years of age, and yet, 
many fought alQPgside their 
classmates during the 1979 
revolution , which succeeded in 
overthrowing the dictatorship of 
Anastacio Somoza. These 
students are among the most 
comitted to the revolution, 
Tamara said . 

The Sandinista government has 
made special efforts to enlist young 
people, especially the university 
students, to go into the ounuyside 
to' experience the Ii fe of the 
campesino. 

'The experience makes us 
aware of the poverty and 
oppression of these people ," said 
Charles Wallace, a student at the 
university. 

After the coffee harvest , the 
students returned to Managua , 
minus two classmates. While 
picking the coffee, Sara Ramirez

and TeOcloro Reyes were killed 
by U.S.-backed, anti-Sandinista 
rebels , known as contras. 

The northern Nicaraguan 
region is a virtual war zone, 
where most of the fighting 
occurs between the Sandinistas 
and contras. The contras are 
based in Honduras, next to the 
Nicaragua border. 

The students, along with the 
campesinos, are continuously 
armed while pickin£ coffee . The 
students don't complain because 
"we are aware that our efforts will 
help in the economic survival of 
our country," said Raul Amador, 
preSident of the National Union 
of University Students (UNEN). 

In the midst of a stepped up 
U.S.-backed contra war, the 
annual coffee harvest has 
become increasingly difficult, 
Amador said . 

"Some 20,000 students and 
workers were to be mobilized last 

year to make up for the labour 
shortages that have hampered 
harvest over the past several 
years," Amador said. "With the 
increasing possibility of a u.s. 
military intervention, our 
government thought it would be 
best to stay here ," he said . 

The students here at the ( 
National University are aware 
that at any time they might be 
called upon to fight against the 
contras. There is a military draft 
which obligates all men between 
the ages of 18 and 25 to enter 
active service for up to two years . 
And women are encouraged to 
enlist, although it is not 
mandated. 

The purpose , the government 
says, is to strengthen the pool of 
human resources available for 
military service. But, the draft 
also depleted the human 
re ources needed for working the 
harvest. which pose economic 

:.: 

hardships for the country. Some 
students will take three months 
off from school and work in the 
coffee harvests. 

There are also those students 
who do get called to the front . 
For example, during a reception 
given to a University of 
California delegation , the 
Nicaraguan students surrounded 
a young man, lifted him up and 
threw him into the air. To an 
American, it looked like a 
celebration. Maybe it was his 
birthday. Maybe he was accepted 
into medical school. 

Wrong. He was called to the 
front in northern Nicaragua to 
fight against the contras. His 
dream was to attend medical 
school. He had one more year 
before he graduated , but instead, 
his edu ation has been delayed 
because of the war.

Mandela begins 
'Direct Action' 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
- Black nationalist leader 
Winnie Mandela called upon 
South Africa's 25 mill ion blacks 
Saturday to begi n a "direct 
action" campaign to bring 
apartheid to an end and oust the 
country's minority white 
government. 

"We believe the next phase of 
our struggle has come," Mandela 
declared in her most militant 
speech in recent months, setting 
a new tone of defiance of the 
government and rallying blacks 
to challenge apartheid directly. 
"No more talking. we are now 
planning action: 

"We are goi ng to phYSically 
dismantle apartheid in this 
country," she told mourners at a 
funeral for a young black killed 
in a recent clash with police. 
"You have been patient for tOO 
long ... but now it is time to 
act." 

Oling that her husband, 
Nelson Mandela, and other 
leaders of the African National 
Congress are serving life prison 
sentences for attempting to 
overthrow white rule, Winnie 
Mandela denounced President 
Pieter W. Botha's government as 
"the real terrorists" and accused 
the American and British 
governments of keeping the 
regime in power. 

"Your freedom is takIng so 
long because Reagan and 
Thatcher are fInancing Pretoria 
to keep you exactly where you 
are." Mandela rejected 
widespread speculation that the 
gove rnment, as pan of ItS step-
by-step reforms, would soon 
release her husband and other 
Imprisoned black leaders and 
allow pol Jt1cal exIles to return to 
negotiate the countrv 's future. 

BLOOM COUNTY 

"You are the ones who must 
free your leaders, and you can 
only free them if you take direct 
action against the Botha regime: 
Mandela said. 

"It has taken us a long way to 
come to this stage of our 
struggle ," she said . "Life itself is 
not the price of freedom, fo r 
freedom has a higher price." 

"Puebla" exhibit for 
Cinco de Mayo 

Hand-cut paper architectural 
facades by Mexican artist 
Humberto spindola will be on 
display at the UCsD's Mandeville 
Gallery from April 11 to May II, 
in conjunction with a celebration 
of Cinco de Mayo. 

The exhibition, called "Puebla," 
will begin with a recepti on to 
meet the artist , from 6-8 pm on 
April 11 in the gallery . 

A performance dedIcated to 
the city of Puebla, Mexico, will 
be the highlight of the reception. 
Dancers from the UCSD dance 
program and from Mexico City 
will wear colored tissue paper 
costumes designed and 
assembled by spindola. 

In 1985, the Mexican Cultural 
Office sent spindola to Helsinki , 
Finland, to create an installation 
for the Museum of Applied Arts. 
Spindola's works were also 
included in a group exhibition 
called "Fourth Generation ," 
which was part of a 50th 
anniversary celebration for the 
Galeria de Ane Mexicano in 
Mexico City. 

New Cal State 
campus planned 

Last month a public meeting 
was held to determine if a 

California state campus is 
needed in the north county and 
where it would be built . 

"We have four sights in mind , 
two in Carlsbad and two in San 
Marcos, but the decision will not 
be made until we know we can 
build ," said Richard Rush, 
director of the proposed campus. 

The cOlistruction will not be 
completed until 1990-91. 

The campus will attract the 
same type of students as San 
Diego State University: the top 
one-th ird of the graduates from 
each high school. 

The actual planning process of 
the campus is nm yet completed., 
"We are waiting until 
construction be¢ns," Rush said. 

Attorney to speak 
on fair wages 

A symposium of "The Legal 
Aspects of Comparable Worth, 
Equal Pay" will be held April 14, 
in conference room lllA in the 
Admi nistrative complex. 

Jeff Gonzales, staff attorney for 
the Cali fornia State Department 
of Fair Employment and Housing 
will speak. 

The symposium will begin on 
Monday at noon and admission 
is free. 

Hypertension sufferers 
needed for study 

Persons with hypertension are 
needed for a UCsD Medical 
Center researc h program testing 
a new medication fo r blood 
pressure management. All 
volunteers receive a free 
comprehensive medical 
evaluation. Those qualifying for 
the researc h program will be 
treated for their high blood 
pressure at no cost. 

According to Richard Barager. 
M.D., new medications being 
tested for blood pressure 
management seem to induce 
fewer of the side effects such as 
headaches or impotence often 
caused by currentl}' prescribed 
medication. 

For Information on the study 
call Dr. Barager at 294-3716.

Latin Alllerican 
debt crisis 

By EMMA-LEE CAPRIO, Staff Writt r 

A SYMPOSIUM ON the international debt crisis, focusing on Latin American, was held April 7 and 8. according to the Institute of the Americas, a co-sponsor of the event. 
The symposium, co-chaired by former President Jimmy 

Carter and Treasury Secretary Howard Baker, intended to 
examine the severity of the debt problem, the costs of current 
solutions and the role of the inter-American community in its 
resolution. 

Guest speakers included the director of the international 
Monetary Fund, Eduardo Wiesner, the finance minister of 
Mexico, Jesus Silva Herzog and the president of Venezuela. 
Jaime Lusinchi. 

Debt in Latin America increased from $49 billion in 1974 to 
$159 billion in 1980. Debt service payments as a percentage of 
exports increased between 1974 and 1980 by nearly 100 
percent in Bolivia, Brazil and Mexico, according to a recent 
report by the Institute of the Americas. 

"One of the major reasons (for the fall in Mexican economy) 
is the fall in the price of oiL Mexico's major export is . 
petroleum; they use petroleum to pay their debt. The fall of oil 
prices has hit them dramatically," said Professor David Mares, 
who is researching Latin America at UCSD. 

"There were also internal domestic political reasons," Mares 
said. "There were elections in 1985. There was fear (from the 
Mexican government) that the economic austerity was going to 
hun the party (PR!) at the polls. So what they did was pump up 
the domestic economy. In the last quaner of 1984, the domestic 
economy grew at something like 7 percent. That's 
unsustainable. To a large degree, that hurt the progress that had 
been made before ," Mares said. 

It is important to recognize that "not all developing countries 
borrowed money (from the internatinal banking community)," 
he said. "For example , the South Koreans borrowed a lot of 
money, but they borrowed prudently. The Taiwanese didn't 
borrow at all. For third world countries, those are major 
economies," he added. 

Mares discounted the possibility of simply writing off the 
debt, sayi ng the banks. who lent the money in the first place, 
would have problems paying back their depositors where the 
capital origi nated. 

"Another solution would be a massive aid program in which 
the western industrial countries would lend the third world 
countries the money to pay back the banks," said Mares. With 
some money getting paid to the banks, the lenders could 
reschedule the loans for the debtor nations so that these 
countries would have a 10)1ger time to pay back the borrowed 
money. "That was seen as the ini tial solution to the debt crisis. 
The problem was that the banks (discovered) that it doesn't 
look like the countries will have the capacIty to pay the amount 
10 years down the road; it's just too large at this point," he

Reward offered in hit and run case 
By MATI lAIT, Stnior Staff Wriur 

The electrical engineering and 
computer sciences (EECs) 
depanment is offering a $500 
reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of the 
driver involved in the hit and 
run incident last March 6, which 
injured Yong Cheng Yang, a 
viSiting scholar from the People's 
Republic of China. 

"We hope it brings results," 
said Mary Manson of the EECS 
department, where Yong is a 
research assistant. 

"The case is still active , but 
maybe something can come out 
of it (the reward money)," said 
Sergeant Raben Jones of the 
UCsD campus police. ·We don 't 
have that much to go on, and we 
don't have anyeyewitnesses." 

Currently there is one suspect 
under investigation, whose car 
has been impounded as 
evidence, believed "to be the car 
involved in the incident," said 
Jones. 

"Right now we are in the 

process of analyzing the 
eVidence," added the sergeant. 
Jones is looking for the state of 
the art in forensics, but admits, 
"It's not like they portray on 
Quincy. This has been an 
education for me as well." 

Yong; 46, is recovering at 
home from a broken arm and 
numerous cuts and bruises. 

Any information which may 
help in this investigation should 
be directed to Sergeant Jones at 
x4359. ~

Fonning a worthy protocol for peace 
What an opponunicy f~r those who wanted to know the truth! The 

Protoc?1 for P~ace delegation had the enviable chance to acquire , first 
hand , Im.presslons and .informat.ion ab~ut one of the strangest and hotly 
debated Iss~es of Amencan foreign policy: the political leanings of the 
people of Nicaragua. 

Per~ap~ the tim~ has finally arrived when Americans will question the 
mu?dled mform~uon dealt by the Reagan administration through the 
mainstream media. Maybe we now will begin to seek out clearer pictures 
of the cha?ges we h~ve seen, thus far , only through biased eyes. Maybe 
now we Will Judge With a sharper, more involved and more immediate 
sense of the events we see. 

receive . '!'Ie hOI?e .for unbi~sed' reporting, but then expect our media to 
substannate their mformanon with statements from "official" government 
~pokesp~rsons . Wash!ngton is .still the source for 80 percent of the mformatlo~ the Amencan pubhc receives, and because we expect our 
n.ews media to use the bueraucracy as a source for facts, we narrow our 
,?ew of the world to that which shows our administration in a favorable 
lI~ht. The government does n~t often pr?vide us with the deepest, least-
biased account of events and interpretations of statistics. 

The ~tudents who visited Nicaragua with the Protocol for Peace 
dele~anon had ~~e opponunity to experience first hand the sentiments 
of Nlcara.guan Citizens. They were also able to ascertain the intentions of 
both factions struggling for political supremacy; all agreed that the effortS 
of the contras a:e cont~ry to the best interests of the people of 
N.lcaragua. The Impressl.on~ of these students is something quite 

Idea~y, t~e recent cultural exchange embarked upon by students of 
the Umverslty of Cali.fo~nia represents an example of a way we might ~earn abou~ other SOCieties Without having to muddle through filtered 
interpretations by our sources. 

Those interpretations are becoming more obvious as we look for 
c~ntrasnng explanations and solutions. The students who visited 
Nlc.aragua over spring break w~re selected to panicipate based upon 
t~etr neutral polmcal stance WHh respect American foreign policy toward 

different from the descnpnons of the Nicaraguan "freedom fighters" we 
hear from PreSident Reagan. His renewed McCanhyian scare has 
become yet another terror to the American public. 

Nlcara~a ; nevenheless , all of those students returned with the 
ImpresslOn .that the Contras were not an appropriate mechanism 
through which to estabhsh a democratic SOciety in Nicaragua. 

A delegate ,crom UC~: Robin Toma, said "It's clear that they (the 
conrr~s) don t have a VISion of a democratic society, of political 
plu~hsm , that they are bent on revenge and the power of the gun." Yet 
PreSident Reagan would have us believe that the contras are the most 

Hopefully, these exchanges are not merely a passing fad . Everyone 
s~o~ld . ~ake t~e effort to become aware of cross-cultural differences and 
Similarities. It IS easy to judge prejudicially those who we only know by 
the ~ord communist. We can easily focus our anger on those who we 
don t know but are told are evil. It is very difficult but worthwhile effort 
nevenheless, to honestly recognize our cultural differences and try to ' 
~ork . toget~er a~yway. W,e must be self-conscious of the ways that we Ide?~lfy thiS nation and Its foes . We must not judge peoples and 

noble democrats south of Texas. 
Our view of the world is very much guided by the information we 

poliCies by the ways that they are different from United States policy. 
Instead,. ~e must thoughtfully come to terms with the social, economic 
and polltlcal problems with which we are faced.

rolled up into one (not to 
mention the soundtrack, which 
would surely reach the top of the 
chans). 

Chamberlain would start off as 
a clean cut young chap who 
supports the status quo but is 
open to suggestions. His 
roommates, both seniors, would 
explain to him that the U.S. 
bloodbath in Vietnam isn 't cool, 
and they all would join the anti-
war movement and Start a

episodes, find a role for Joan 
CoDins, and it's a sure hit. 

Four years ago I walked onto 
this campus with my Stones and 
Doors abums tucked snuggly 
under my arm and an ounce of 
Humboldt's best in the bottom of 
my backpack. 

I was ready to "do" the student 
thing: the wild parties, the wild 
women, shrooming with 10 
friends in a candlelit dormroom 
debating whether or not Karl 
Marx was the Antichrist, protests, 
marching on the chancellor, 
arguing with Ph.D.s and quoting 
Hunter Thompson from memory. 

I missed by a longshot. 
Everything I knew about 

college, everything I'd heard, 
came from the '60s. I expected 
UCSD to be the way I had 
imagined college campuses of 
the past, but it wasn't - not 
even close . A litde brother of that 
era, both literally and figuratively, 
[ was weaned into adolescence 
by CUt-orrs , Bob Dylan, Viemam, 
Richard Nixon and television 
news reports of college students 
taking control. 

When I was nine years old, I 
wore a beaded choker and hair 
down to my shoulderblades. 
Today, I look more like a Young 
Republican than my past 
warrants. What happened? 

I grew tired of living in the 
shadow of the '60s. An exciting 
era though it was, it was time to 
move on. I wanted my own era, 
not one pickled in formaldeliyde 
and displa~d center-stage three 
times a week by "Big Chill" 
professors. Sometime during the 
past three years my romantic 
Image of the '60s turned sour 
and my cynicism grew. It has 
been a long time since I have 
wanted to hear Jim Morrison 
scream. 

Everything looks bener in 
retrospect. Look at the protests 
over the Vietnam War. The tide 

turned against the war at the 
height of student 
demonstrations, with public 
pressure eventually growing so 
hot that the United States pulled 
out of Southeast Asia. But it's 
hard to ignore that before we left 
the area, the United States had 
been involved in Asia for over 15 
years and thousands of young 
men had died. 

The '60s were an exciting time 
for the country. The turmoil 
shi fted the nation's attitudes 
toward, race, sex, war and 
politiCS in a revolutionary way. 
But that turmoil fizzled into the 
great void of the 70s and has 
now been reduced to chapters in 
U.S. history books. It has been 
processed into a nice tidy 
package: "The '60s: the baby-
boomers change America." 

Unfonunately, people only 
remember the packaging, not 
what was inside. Memories have 
become commercialized. Now I 
look at my own generation and 
wonder what went wrong. 
Ronald Reagan, In me laSt six 
years, has resurrected a country 
that seems to have forgotten 
everything it has learned since 
Kennedy. 

Did the same peopl.e who 
protested the Vietnam War sit 
idly by as the United States sent 
"advisers" and supplies to EI 
Salvador and Nicaragua? Do 
those who shed tears at the news 
of Manin Luther King. Jr.'s tragiC 
assassination invest in 
companies that exploit the 
monetary benefits of South 
African racism? Did the same 

people who wanted to impeach a 
secretive and paranoid president, 
such as Richard Nixon, vote for 
Ronald Reagan? 

[t appears that we must relearn 

what we were taught more than 
two decades ago. Those lessons 
have faded from our memory too 
fast. Must we go through another 
social revolution? Can we? ~ 

Differentiating 
evidence and truth 
By KATHY BECKETT, Contributing Editor 

It would be nice to think that 
there is a single cause of a 
phenomenon as disturbing as 
terrorism. Locating the cause in 
the lunacy and fanaticism of Col. 
Moammar Kadafi serves to 
generate much needed suppon 
for the Reagan Administration's 
foreign policy, but it precludes 
any complex analysis of 
international affairs that could 
result in criticism of U.S. foreign 
policy, past or present. 

The Reagan Administration's 
propensity to depict world affairs 
in dichotomous terms (evil vs. 
good, East vs. West, etc.) has 
taken a new twist Kadafi vs. the 
rest of the "civilized world ." The 
historical, social and political 
causes of terrorism are ignored, 
and once again, the U.S. 
government goes on its meny 
way, denying the complexity of 
the modem world and 
implementing solutions that, at 
best, are effective in the shon 
term. It simply is not true that if 
Kadafi were eradicated terrorism 
would cease to plague our 
SOCiety. 

In fact, U.s. persecution of 
Kadafi may serve to facilitate 
precisely the opposite of the 
Administration's goal. Anti-
American sentiment can and will 
be used by Kadafi to promote 
Arab unity in much the same 
manner that Reagan utilized anti- . 
Kadafi sentiment. If the absence 
of terrorism is indeed the 
Administration's top priority, its 
poliCies must be re-evaluated. 

Current U.S. policies, however, 
do serve a purpose. The Libyan 
"crisis" has been successful in 
deflecting attention away from 
the faltering economy and 
government's inability to cope 
with the two trillion dollar 
deficit. In addition, a resurgence 
of patriotism will be extremely 
useful to President Reagan as he 

plans his response to the 
Congressional defeat of proposed 
military aid to the COntras. 

Despite allegations made by 
the U.S., evidence revealing 
Ubyan involvement in the recent 
terrorist incidents has not yet 
been produced. Although it is 
quite possible that such evidence 
will surface, it is also possible 
that this "evidence" will be 
falsified or inauthentic. Our 
government is well-trained in the 
an of fact-manipulation. The 
parameters of this manipulation 
are defined by the willingness of 
both the public and the press to 
scrutinize claims made by the 

.govemment; the reluctance to do 
so is largely a result of the 
feverish patriotism that, 
precipitated by Reagan's rhetOric, 
has swept the country. Other 
factors contributing to the 
unwillingness to challenge 
government statements include 
restricted access to information 
(the Reagan Administration has 
made more than 64 executive 
actions to limit access to 
information and restrict freedom 
of the press since coming into 
office) and making the press 
dependent on government 
sources. 

Waiting for the "truth" or the 
"facts" to be released from a 
govemment which openly 
proclaims the "irrelevance of the 
literal truth" is not unlike waiting 
for Godot. The Administration 
displa~d its willingness to 
fabricate and alter reality with 
the release of the "White Paper" 
in 1981. The document's 
inauthenticity, however, did not 
lesen its impact the release of 
the document was given far more 
coverage than was the 
determination of its illegitimacy. 
Its effect, therefore, remained 
great The successfulness of this 
tactic may lead the 

Administration to recycle the 
ploy in an attempt to bolster 
suppOrt for U.S. policy. 

The recent U.S. claim that 
Kadafi worked in cahoots with 
East Berlin in the latest terrorist 
attack in West Berlin serves an 
especiaUy useful funcitOn: the 
alignment of Libya with the "Red 
menace." CIA Director William 
Casey's rare public speach based 
support for the "coumer-terrorist" 
attacks on the unity of aU those 
countries whoe philosophies are 
non-Western or whose policies 
include non-alignmem. Such a 

claim contradicts reality; many of 
these countries are themselves in 
conflict. Orwell's vision of a 
future without an objective reality 
is itself becoming a reality. 

Because the u.s. media is 
obligated to cover govemment 
officials, the Administration has 
much contol over the issues 
upon which Americans focus 
their attention. Inconvenient 
facts are disregarded. and cenain 
"news information" is released 
when it is expedient to do so. It 
is difficult for each individual to 
determine the facts involved in a

OPINIONS 
!orei$n policy inci~ent: however, 
the willingness to swallow, 
verbatim, those facts released by 
the government is to relinquish 
the most important check on 
government authority. Fascism is 
characterized by the individual 
"repudiationof the intellect": the 
inability to think independently 
or critically and the domination 
of fear and a sense of 
community (to which, of course, 
others do not belong). Thus far, 
Reagan's rhelOric has led us 
dangerously close to this perilous 
predicament. ~ 

Invincible bravado 
By PETER QUERelA 

America's bach! The 
invincibility of Tht United States 
Military was proven again last 
month by a retaliation against 
madman Col. Moammar Kahdafi 
of Libya. America's vastly 
superior anned forces really won 
a big one for the Gipper. [t was 
the president's finest hour. For a 
while, it seemed likely that our 
electronic journalists would 
capture a scene of Tip O'Neill 
and Teddy Kennedy carrying the 
triumphant Gipper into the 
White House Press Room on 
their shoulder to pose for the 
ultimate "photo opponunity." 

The show required only three 
60,000 ton aircraft carriers, six 
cruiser destroyers equipped with 
advanced Harpoon surface-to-
surface missiles, five support 
ships, I2 frigates and 27 
warships in aD. [n addition, 70 
attack planes, 80 fighter jets, and 
250 of the Navy's most 
sophisticated and deadly aircraft 
and an anned supppon crew of 
almost 30,000 men brought 
Khadafi to his knees. [t was 
possibly the greatest exhibition 
of military might since the 
Spanish Armada. 

But the damage inflicted by 
Our Superior Forces was beautiful: 
One Libyan missle control site 
was "neutralized" (obliterated). A 
Ubyan patrol boat was left "dead 
in the water," (no apparent 
survivors), and one other leaky 
Libyan scow was "disabled." 
(mayday!). But best of all, a 
dozen of Khadafj's insignificant

pawns are now providing 
nourishment for hungry 
Mediterranean fishes. And the 
bill for Reagan's rwo-day fishing 
expedition was certainly a 
bargain at only $125 million. 

Presidential spokesman Larry 
"Double" Speakes at first 
hemmed and hawwed about the 
U.S. Sixth fleet having just 
happened to be in Khadafi's 
neighborhood when it was 
attacked suddenly and without 
cause. Later he conceded the 
obvious: the U.S. had provoked 
the conflict. It was strictly a 
public relations Stunt designed to 
enhance the image of our 
military strength. 

Still, a poll 'conducted by USA 
Today fOtlnd that a majority (67 
percent) of Americans bought it. 
They backed the commander-in-
chiers counter-insurgency assault 
in the Gulf of Sidra, a land-
locked lagoon of the utmost 
strategic value in the interest of 
national security. Most Americans 
feel we're indeed "Standing Tall ," 
oblivious to the fact we are als 
standing alone. Not a single 
country on Eanh agrees with the 
bullying approach being 
practiced with increasing 
frequency by the United States, 
and by Libya, for that maner. 

Even "[ron Lady" Thatcher, 
heroine of the Falkland Islands 
slaughter, offered Reagan only a 
lackadaisical shrug at last 
month's spectacle. Funher, you'll 
recall how the president, time 
and again , has coerced, bribed

and pled with world leaders to 
join us in boycotting goods 
produced in both Libya and 
Nicaragua. Yet. to date, not one 
solitary nation has chosen to 
panicipate in the scheme. When 
even our longtime allies ignore 
us , it is time the Administration 
reevaluated its failed foreign 
policy. How much longer will the 
White House continue its 
reckless use of military might 
before exhausting traditional 
methods of negotiation and 
diplomacy? For too long the 
Reagan Administration has send 
Signals that imply that violence is 
a virtue , assuming that it is 
inflicted by our forces. But of 
course , it's no fun being a 
wannonger if there's no war. 

As such, the Reaganites in 
Washington , in JUSt six years, 
ha ve committed terrorist acts or 
subsidized such activities, both 
coven and overt, from the 
jungles of Latin America to the 
shores of Tripoli . Now we learn

invasion of 1983, plans to hand 
out commendations like 
Halloween candy to our warriors

Relentless factions 
Editar: 

Although not necessarily 
desiring an ongoing 
correspondence with certain 
special interest, self·serving 
factions on this campus, [ find it 
necessaty to respond to these 
groups through the Guardian . To 
my fellow students who know me 
and my true political viewpoints, 
I ask for your indulgence. 

I am not anti-Semitic. I am, 
however, becoming increasingly 
"anti·horse's ass." To say that I 
have "offended all of .. . 
Judaism" is ludicrous. You may 
recaU that the genesis of this 
incident was my writing two new 
indicator collective members' 
names over a cartoon of Arafat 
and Khadaffy. It is these quasi-
politicians that have relentlessly 
attacked and offended jewish 

persons and judaism. 
Futthennore, your use of the 
issue of judaism and anti· 
Semitism with respect to jews, as 
a means to launch a personal 
tirade against me is 
unacceJX3ble. Why do you base 
your arguments on these issues 
and not on the facts of the 
matter? 

You say that I evade the 
"central question involved in 
posting the cartoon on my AS. 
office door, that is "why, out of 
all the people in the alternative 
media did I choose to identify 
two jews?" I do not select my 
friends on the basis of their 
religion, color or their skin, or 
creed . I also do not select my 
political foes for these reasons. 
You say that the chances were 
"remote" that I identified two 
jews. I simply identified the 
persons I find most offensive.

I hardly believe that [ 
"defamed" or "insulted aU Arabs: 
Granted, Arafat and Khadaffy do 
represent segments of opinion in 
the Middle East, bur your 
extrapolation that these two men 
represent "aD Arabs" is incorrect. 

~sArabtrepre~ntthose 
factions that have split off from 
his Palestinian Liberation 
Organization? ~s Khadaffy 
represent the moderate Arab 
slates that have denied him the 
chance to participate in the 
Organization of Arab States? I 
think not. The cartoon was a 
poke of fun at the extremism 
exhibited by these two "leaders." 
My alterations were also satirical; 
a jab at members of the 
alternative media. 

You claim that I am anti· 
Semitic. This [ am not, but I may 
be "anti·semantic." Your 
reveliHion of the historical 

origins of the word ·zeal" is 
inappropriate. I used the word as 
it is often used, as it is often 
used without regards to its 
derivations. In addition, if my 
world history knowledge serves 
me correctly, your reference to 
the Zealots in such glowing 
terms is misleading; as I recaU, 
they were some of the most 
savage and ruthless murderers 
that the world has ever seen. My 
use of the word "demeans 
commitment to freedom?" 
Hardly! 

There is one last point of 
information I question you on. 
Why did no jewish student 
organization leaders sign your 
letter? I have spoken with 
members 01 the Israeli ACtion 
Committee and they do not find 
me to be racist or anti-Semitic. 
Also, if you truly find the cartoon 
offensive, I would like to suggest 
that you write to its originator.

Struggles 
Continued from Coyer 
students say they will defend 
their cOUntry and under no 
uncerrain terms will they give up 
their sovereignty. 

"We are a very combative 
people: said Charles Wallace, a 
student at the National 
Universiry. 

"We are certain tnat the 
contras win never win ," Wallace 
said. "The 5100 million for the 
contras, President Reagan wants 
so badly, wiD only cause more 
bloodshed," WaDace said. 

"We want peace," he said. 
The students here believe the 

Reagan Administration is 
obsessed with overthrowing their 
IJlvernment, a government they 
say is "legitimate" and "has the 
right to detennine its own 
furure : 

Students are the greatest 
supporters of the Sandinista 
IJlvernment and the government 
relies on their suppo" whenever 
needed. 

Since the 1979 revolution , the 
students have been mobilized 
several times for major 
government projects. 

One such project, the national 
Uteracy Crusade, was conducted 
mostly by the yourh of Nica:agua. 

More than 60,000 students, 
caUed brigadislas, participated in 
the massive campaign to teach 

. the campcsinos how to read and 
write. During the day, these 
brigadistas would work in the 
fields with the campesinos and 
at night, they would teach the 
campesinos for two hours. 

"I was honored to have been 
able to participate in the literacy 
campaign," said Sixto Garache. 
"It's the least I can .do for my 
country: he said. 

The brigadislas helped reduce 
illiteracy from 50% to less than 
13%, according to government 
figures. During the five months, 
56 brigadistas died: six were 
kiUcd by Somoza's National 
Guard and 50 by accidents and 
illnesses. 

Many of the students here are 
proud of the contriburions they 

have made since the rewludon. 
They are proud to be 
panicipants in rebuUding their 
country and are committed to 
defending it 

"The cost of achieving this 
revolutionary triumph was high 
and we wiD protect it with our 
lives: Amador said. 

The US·supported contra war 
is disrupting the lives of the 
young Nicaraguans. Close to 65% 
of the population is under 25 
years of age. They are the 
majoriry of the Nicaraguans who 
are fighting against the contras. 
They are the ones who are

Phone receivers are too cold to kiss 
By KEN RJRIE, Features Editor 

I T SEEMS TO BE going around, nowadays. More and more people I meet are 
struggling with a long distance 
relationship, and more and more 
people are hating Ii fe . I croon, I 
sympathize and comfort them, 
because I know what it's like I'm 
the king of the long distance 
relationship. I've been at it for 
four years now, and we've never 
had a breakup. We came close a 
few times, but not quite close 
enough. I empathize with these 
people. I know how it is. 

The disadvantages of a long 
distance relationship far 
outweigh the advantages, for one 
reason. Communication. Phone 
calls cost money, so you have 
that hanging over your head, and 
when you can't look her in the 
eye for three whole weeks, but 
you're arguing with her now, you 
can't convince her of your 
earnesmess with that reassuring 
grip on her shoulder, and you 
can't persuade her you still love 
her by taking her face between 
your hands and pressing a 
desperate, feeling kiss 
somewhere in the vicinity of her 
mouth. It doesn't work. Phone 
receivers are way too cold to 
kiss. 

But Krista and I are old pros. 
We don 't have those kinds of 
troubles any more (all my 
roommates are laughing at this 
moment). We know what the 
other person means, even though 
he/she can't say it. We've been 
together almost five years. That's 
longer than a lot of marriages, 
and we're both pretty proud of 
that. But to Krista, this is a bit of 
a problem, too. 

"So when are we getting 
married?" she asks innocently. 

Uh, on. 
"Why? What's your hurry ?!!" It 

slips out, I can't stop it. And my 
voice, I notice, is suddenly 
squeaky and panicked. Shit! 

"AH HA! There . You don't 
want to get married! I heard 
you." 

"What? What did I say? I 
never said I didn't want to get 
married." 

"You didn't have to," she says, 
with hun and certainty. 

"Here you go again ," I say with 
disgust. "You're putting words in 
my mouth . You think I hate your 
fadtu." 

"You do!" she pounces. "I 
heard how you just said that. 
'Your father ,' you said. Why don't 
you like him?" 

"Because he doesn't like me." 
"You're wrong. He likes you. 

He always goes out of his way to 
mMc you fed at home." 

"That's only because YOU 'I'l 
8IOUJld. He doesn't want to cross 
his precious. I pray to heaven 
I'm never with him alone and 
there arc any butcher knives 
neaJby." 

"How can you say that? What 
do you dUnk-" 

9ae stops, and I hold IllY 
txe.h, waiting. Then she says: 

"'You basrard. You changed the 
subject again." 

okay, so she caught me. I 
can't get away with much 
anymore, not since we've been 
.,ing out so long and know each 
ocher so wei. 

The pattern with us has been 

that we don 't do very well when 
I'm away, but when we get 
together on a weekend, or take a 
trip together, eveything is gravy. 
We can fight and hurt each 
other trying to talk things out 
over the phone for two whole 
weeks, and when we finally get 
together, after 10 minutes it's all 
forgotten . It's not always that 
way, though. 

Sometimes, when the fights we 
have ("discussions ," I call them 
to my friends) are particularly 
deep, when we're reworking or 
advancing our relationship in a 
new direction, we will stay up all 
night in order to smooth 
everything out. This has been the 
one thing that has saved us. We 
are both willing to go to hell and 
back in order to salvage our 
relationship. 

We have made a pact, and it 
has worked. We do nOl hang up 
on each other. If one or the 
other gets mad enough to hang 
up, they never do. Neither of us 
can deny the bond of love we 
have which is always there -
regardless of how angry we 
sometimes get - and to hang 
up in the middle of an argument 
is actually trying to deny that 
love. Or so we see it. So we talk 
things out. Especially when we're 
together. I tell her: 

"It doesn 't maner if we spend 
$600 on the phone, or stay up 
for three nights straight. With 
our relationship the way it is, if 
either one of us stays mad at the 
other, bad things will happen. 
You're worth whatever money it 
might cost, or time, or sleep, to 
make you feel bener. We can't 
afford to let the other get away 
with horrible feelings." 

We've stuck by it, and it has 
saved us. 

Then there are the times when 
things are going really well , 
which is actually the majority of 
the time, despite how IIshe 
sometimes complains. We have 
very different and separate lives, 
and it's painful to both of us that 
the other one isn 't a pan of it. So 
we tty 10 catch each other up , 
and the time on the phone just 
whizzes by. We both talk at a 
few hundred miles an hour; I 
laugh , she laughs, we talk and 
talk and talk. 

But even the good times have 
their drawbacks. One which 
really plagues me is her need to 
have power over me; her need to 
convince herself that she is still 
anractive to me. Usually, this 
need will manifest after a brief 
silence, a IuD in our 
conversation. Her voice will drop 
incredibly low, and become 
strangely soft and deep. I 
immediately know what's 
coming. 

"Ken?" she murmurs. 
"NO!" I cry, trying to head her 

off. 
"Ken," she teases, "do you 

know what fm wearing right 
now?" 

"Don't sta rt. Please don't. I 
can't take it. I'm not going to see 
you for another twO weeks, so 
don't staTl- " 

"Ken .. ." she whispers, and just 
like that I'm caught. "Ken ... " she 
breathes, and I'm in agony. 

·You're such a bitch ," I say, 
not really meaning it. "Why do 
you do this to me?" 

~Ken .n 
"STOPlT!" 
She has ~r over me. Of 

course she does. That's fine, I 
guess, or we wouldn't have come 
this far. 

In june, I graduate. She is 

filled with glee at the thought. 
"You're mine, then . In June, 

you're an mine!" 
And although I sometimes lead 

I J 

her to believe differendy (why, I 
don't know), it isn 't such a 
horrible thought for me 
either. ~

UCSD crushes LaVerne, 12-0 

Tritons fil)d 
proper balance 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Spons Editor 

B MANCE. That elusive combination of pitching, defense and hilling that 
has mysteriously evaded the 
Triton baseball team so far this 
spring showed up Tuesday at 
just the right time, as the Tritons 
clobbered Division \I rival La 
Verne 12-0. 

By totally dominating the 
number-one team in the SClAC 
conference (La Verne was co-
leader with Claremont Mudd), 
the Tritons served notice that 
UCSD merits consideration when 

the Division II regional picks are 
made for the playoffs in May. 

"It was a big win in a number 
of ways," said a pleased coach 
Lyle Yates, ·Owen Wright (La 
Vernes's coach) is on the 
selection committee and this 
should establish us as one of the 
favorites. " 

The Tritons got powerful 
pitching performances from two 
of their aces and a reliever in 
shuning down La Verne on just 
three hits (aU singles) . Mark

Woman 's water polo remains undefeated in J muts, despite the loss oj two goalies. 

Women's water-polo off 
to hot 3-0 start in '86 

By DEBBIE PAGE 

T HE UCSD WOMEN'S water polo team has managed to stay 
undefeated at 3-0 for the season, 
despite the loss of both the 
number one and two goalies for 
those games. 

Starting goalie , junior Jennifer 
Rennick, was out with a shoulder 
injury (she was due to return in 
yesterday'S match with SDSU), 
and the number two goalie was 
out of town, so newcomer Diana 
Langdon was placed in the box. 
The Tritons seemed to have no 
problem With this and, along 
with Langdon's excellent play, 
have produced three wins, 

The home opener against Cal 
Poly Pomona was an easy victory 
(UCSD 13, CCP 5) as was the 
match with Division I UC Irvine 
(UCSD 10, UCI 5) Commerce 
Aquatic Club provided the team 
with some good competition 
until the fourth period where it 
was tied 6-6, but at that point 

the Tritons pulled ahead and 
went on to win 9-6. 

Because the women's water 
polo season is short, the team i~ 
already looking toward Nationals, 
which are less than a month 
away. 

Nationals will be held in 
Boston at Harvard University on 
May 2, 3 and 4. Coach Denny 
Harper is very optomistic about 
the team's chances in making it 
to Nationals. Although he lost 
two key players, Michelle Caroll 
and Monica Alexy-Carter, to 
eligibility problems, he feels the 
team has strong enough leaders 
to make up for those losses. 
Returning co-captains, junior 
Janell Lowe and senior Karen 
Givens, seem to be providing the 
team with the experience 
necessary for winning. 

Other returning players 
include: senior Allison Shoenfeld; 
juniors Jamie Anderson , Mary 
Botich and Annie Gayle; and 

sophomore Raeanne Rivira. 
Other key players include back-
up goalie Sharon Kiefer, transfer 
Jenny Hohne and freshman 
Amanda PalmquiSt. 

In addi tion to the strong 
returning team, there are several 
newcomers. Coach Harper has 
seven freshmen who have never 
played before. However, he 
doesn't mind their inexperience: 
"It gives me a chance to train 
them right. There are no 
(playing) errors that need to be 
corrected." He feels they will be a 
strong group in the next couple 
of years. The next challenge the 
team faces is a match this Friday 
afternoon versus C1aremont-
Mudd, to be held at Canyonview 
at 3:15. They also have a 7:30 
match that night against a San 
Diego women's open team, also 
at Canyonview. Their match this 
Saturday morning should prove 
to be a "very good one," 
according to Harper. u:::J 

Tennis 5-4 under Schanback 
By MAJU( PINKUS 
"S AN DIEGO'S just too tough. We dOn't stand a 

chance.~ The words 
of Azusa Pacific's coach Henry 
Gee provrd to be true as the 
men's rennis team scored an 
impressive 9'{) victory agaiosf 
Azusa this past Saturday. 

UCSO's number one player, 
John Mapes, had the 'toughest 
match of the day, e~ging OUt 
Azusa's top player Scon Carter, 
6-2, 3-6, 7-5 finishing With a 9-7 
tie breaker. Mark Sandknop, 
number twO singles player and 
captain of the Tritons, pulled off 
the comeback of the day after 
being down 5-4 in th e third sct, 
only to win the next three games 
and take the mJt h 6-1, 4-6, 7-5. 
The other four single matches 
were won In smllght sets,

the next two b-l . 6-3. TheIr

clean sweep. 

Jim Schanback. who became 
coach only three weeks lIfO, is 
plased with his team's play. 
"The team is coming togfther 
and playing some real JlOd 
tennis,H he said. The Tritons, 
who haYe an 11-9 overaB record, 
are 5-4 since Schanback took 
over including back-lO-back 9-0 
matches. The day before beating 
Azusa Pacific, UCSD blanked 
California Lutheran. 

With playoffs coming next 
month it remains questionable 
whether San Diego will be 
oITered a spot in the DiVision III 
tournament. Their last five 
matches inc:lude ompeting

Mapes, only a freshman, was 
much more confident when 
discusssing the playoffs: ·We

been playing well and haYe a 
good shot at Nationals, If the 
team can beat Sanm Cruz and 
Redlands. the team should be 
going also, Latel)', eYeryone's 
been playing well ." 

If anyone is playi ng well , it's 
the young Mapes, and the coach 
is extremely happy with him. 
'John'S the kind of guy you want 
on your team ," said Schanback, 
"He's a good student and a great 
competitor, ..

Sloan improved his record to 5-2 
while pitching the first five 
innings. Sloan gave up all of La 
Verne's hits, struck out three and 
didn't walk anyone. Rick Nowak 
- who tossed UCSD's first no-
hitter ever last Saturday - ran 
his hitless streak to ten straight 
inning by tossing three more 
hitless ones against La Verne. 
The freshman Nowak walked just 
one while striking out four. In 
his last 19 innings, Nowak had 
K'd 22 batters. 

"We've got a big double-
header this weekend, so we 
didn't want to have Sloan or 
Nowak toss a whole game," said 
Yates, 'We wam to save them 
both for the weekend." 

Casey Morales - who cleared 
eligibility earlier in the day -
came in and shut out La Verne 
in the ninth to preserve the 
victory. 

The Tritons got big offensive 
output from several of the 
starting nine. Right fielder Dan 
DiMascio and second-baseman 
Dave Stanovich both went four 
for five as tne Tritons pounded 
out 16 hits. DiMascio hit three 
doubles and knocked in two 
runs while Stanovich knocked in 
a run with his four hits. 

Bob Natal hit his seventh hole 
run of the year and knocked in 
two, while the Tritons got two 
hits a piece from Derek Alkonis 
and Jim Nicolaisen. 

"We got a good team effort 
from everyone when we really 
needed it," said Yates, 
"Claremont and La Vetne are 
both 8-1 in Division 11, but that 
is against competition like 
Pomana and Cal Tech." Both 
Claremont and La Verne have 
played - and won - six games 
against pitiful Pomona and even 
more pitiful Cal Tech, The 
Tritons have no games scheduled 
agai nst either. 

What we have in our favor is 
[hat La Verne and Claremont are 
now going to begin head-to-head 
competition. This is going to be 
our chance to advance," said 
Yates. 1m

CBS, last Sunday as the Sixers 
and Celtics squared off. 

The scowling Celtic guard was 
turned into a jellowy mass in the 
shortest match ever recorded on

ultimate wisdom, kicked Threatt 
out of [he game, rather than 
awarding him the Croix de

medal. 

In an exclusive post-match 
interview, Threatt told the 
Guardian that he merely reacted 
the way any good basketball fan 
would have to Aingc's challenge.

Threatt said, "but when he began

TIw Elephant Bar & 
Grill is no place {or 
youngsters. The long* 
awaited replacement for 
the sorely missed Rodeo 
and quarter beer nights is 
bound to be a big 
disapointment to those 
in the monthly allow~ 
ance income tax bracket. 
If you ' ha ve to ask how 
much the valet parking

costs, you probably can't 
dress to match the linen

Stay home and watch

instead. 

• Relics from the heat of 

by robert leone 
Art, especially in the 

form of aesthetics, can 
often be found in 

utilitari~n objects. This is 
especially true when a 
conscious effort has been 
made to create art and 
utility in the same object. 
The Bauhaus movement 
lives on in chairs sold at 
major departm~nt stores, 
for example. However, the 
greatest case of a common 
object stirring feelings in 
the heart is that symbol of 
municipal pride, the fire 
engine. 

The first thing you see 
when you step through the 
dark doorway of T he 
Firehouse Museum are 
two fine Seagrave 
pumpers, one a 1928 
e ngi n e, the other a 
magnificently restored and 
polished red and chrome 
vehicle built in 1938. 
O ther treasures include an 
American la fra nce "fire-
truck" built o n a Ford 
Model-T chassis, a hand-
drawn fire engine that was 
La jolla's sale fire engine 
from 1903 to 1913 and a 
fire pumper that was 

retirt!d from service 
sometime during the Civil 
War. 

And then there are the 
walls, cove red with frames 
filled with more than 600 
shoulder patches from fire 
departments from across 
the nation and the world, 
many demo n strating 
variations on the Maltese 
Cross moti f (the common 
emblem of firefighters).

as are a host of other 
miscellaneous articles, 
including fire mark, 
which were labels by 
which an insurance 
company's firefighters 
would know if premiums 
had been paid. 

If there is anything 

wrong with this museum 
of firefighting, formed in 
1962, it is that it suffers 
from an embarrasment of 
riches, which should not 
distress a confirmed fire 
buff. It is sponsored by the 
Pioneer Hook and Ladder 
Company, an enthusiasts' 
organization whose 
members, often retired 
firefighters, are know-
ledgeable about their 
hobby, and only too 
willing to share what they 
know. However, it is an 
extensive collection of that 
peculiar equation of 
municipal safety with 
municipal pride with 
municipal art, and filled 
with trucks bearing 
historical vehicle o r 
horseless carriage license 
plates. It's a lot of fun. 

The Firehouse Museum 
is located at the corner of 
Columbia and Cedar, near 
downtown San Diego. It is 
open from 10 am to 4 pm 
on Saturdays and Sun-
days. Admission is free, 
but donations are 
appreciated (aren't they 
always?). Photography is 
allowed.

'A Bit of 
America 

Four new plays, consisting 
of one full~length piece and 
three one~acts, will be 
presented tonight through 
Saturday in the Warren 
Theatre, behind the UCSD 
bookstore. 

The three short works, 
Champions of the West, 
Businessman, and Winter in 
July will be performed at 6 pm 
tonight and Saturday, and at8 
pm Friday and Sunday. The 
longer work, Cut wSunser, will 
hit the stage at 8:30 pm 
tonight and Saturday, 6 pm 
tomorrow and Sunday. 

The plays are works by 
graduate students studying 
with Adele Shank, associate 
professor of drama and 

award~winning poet/ play~ 
wright. 

Ranging about America, 
the four theatre pieces tell 
tales set in the Midwest, 
Southwest, L.A. and in a 
disturbed family . Reid 
Jensen's Ohampions oj' rhe 
West, directed by Victoria 
Hunter, shows a homeless 
father and son drifting 
through the countryside with 
burdens of failure and dreams 
of breaking out. Businessman, 
by Johnathan Field, directed 
by Beth Ann Schachter, has a 
southwest real estate man 
trying to close a deal while a 
brother and sister fight to 
survive. Caridad Svich's 
Winter in July, directed by 
Ross S. Wasserman, is billed 
as a bizarre comedy about a 
peculiar family: a mother, a 
daughter and a son whose 
unbreakable bonds keep their 
parasitic relationship 
together. 

William Berno's play Cur to 
Sunset is directed by Ralph 
Janes. The full length work is 
set in Los Angeles on the day 
before the Watts riots 
began.lt follows the life of a 
hooker and a criminal and 
their meeting with a stranger 
on a mission to find Mother 
Hollywood. 

Tickets are $5 for students, 
$9 for general admission 
(students may also use their 
coupons), and are available 
through TicketMaster, at the 
Student Center Box Office, or 
may be reserved at 452~4574. 
Subject to availability, tickets 
may also be pruchased at the 
Warren Theatre before the 
performances.

A guide to everywhere 
Solana Beach is a nice town: 

secure, peaceful - even a bit 
on the idyllic side. It's not the 
place you'd expect to find 
Masai Warriors in barren 
deserts. 

Perhaps Tony and Susan 
Childs thought it should be. 
In late January, they opened 
Word Journeys. BaSically, it's 
a bookstore; but in another 
more meaningful sense, it's an 
adventure unto itself. 

It doesn't take long, upon 
entering, to realize that the 
works of Milton and Dickens 
aren't on this store's shelves. 
Take a quick look, and the 
titles make an impact: Weird 
and Wonderful Wildlife, Small

and other smaller stores. 
"This is an old~fashioned, 
library~type setting," 
explained Tony Childs, "that 
some of the tamer ones. In 
fact, if any corner of the globe 
can or has been traversed, 
chances are there's a book 
about it for sale here. 

"Because we have done lots 
of traveling, we found that 
you just can't get what you 
want informa tion~wise," 
explained Tony Childs. "Not 
only can you not get it in one 
store, you can 't get it in any 
store." 

It was this frustration 
combined with what is an 
almost universally shared love 
of traveling which prompted 
the Childs to bring the 
concept of Word Journeys to 
life. There was also a feeling 
that large bookstores (like the 
University Bookstore) and

makes it so much more 
pleasant. " 

The fact is, both owners 
have traveled extensively and 
are more than excited about 
discussing both their journeys 
and the books they've read 
about the exotic destinations 
with their customers. 

For example, the Childs 
like to tell the story of their 
journey through Africa 
during which they met up 
with Ian Hibbel, a bicyclist 
who managed to ride across 
the Sahara while on a sojourn 
from Patagonia to the Arctic 
Circle. 

"We couldn't believe this 
guy had this bicycle," said 
Susan Childs, recalling the 
meeting. "I mean, we had just 
come through thinking it was 
this great deal that we had 
made it (in a truck)!" 

Recently, Hibbel wrote a 
book chronicling his 
adventure and, upon hearing 
of it, the Childs bought it, 
read it and consequently 
bought several copies for the 
store. 

As fate would have it, 
Word Journeys opened hot 
on the heels of Outof Africa, a 
film which has not only been a 
huge box office success (and 
which copped seven Oscars), 
but which has created a 
renewed interest in travel to 
the Dark Continent: an 
interest which certainly has

not hurt the Childs' business. 
Adding to this is the fact that 
Africa, say the Childs, is one 
of their favorite travel 
destinations. 

"There is this feeling and 
this draw from Africa," Tony . 
Childs explained, "You'll feel 
it when you read these 
accounts about people who 
lived in Africa, and you'll hear 
it time and time again from 
people, that they want to go 
back. And we feel the same 
way." 

Both traveling enthusiasts 
said they feel that travel is an 
imp,ortant part of many 
people's lives, and have 
nothing but admiration and 
kind words for those who 
manage to take time out to 
travel and explore. And both 
say that most anyone can 
travel, if they know what to 
do. 

"Really - buy the books," 
suggested Tony Childs. "You 
have some of these in the 
(Central University) library: 
Work Your Way Around the 
World, Work / Study TratJel 
Abroad, OtJerseas Summer Jobs. 
There are a lot of ways to do 
it. " 

The Childs both suggest 
that anyone who is serious 
about traveling should "just 
get out there and do it. II In 
their experiences, they say, 
things manage to work 
themselves out and even being 

somewhere like in Afghanist~ 
an or Iran can be a fantastic, 
educational and memorable 
experience. 

What the Childs say they 
really want is to help those 
who want to travel in a way 
that travel services can't: by 
rela ti ng experiences and 
helping with travel advice. 
Even if the destination is only 
Mount Laguna or Los 
Angeles, they have both the 
books and the experience to 
help. Even their two outside 
employees are seasoned 
travelers . 

Perhaps Henry David 
Thoreau best expressed the 
feeling which the Childs and 
their store convey when he 
wrote, "This curious world 
we inhabit is more wonderful 
than convenient; more 
beautiful than it is useful; it is 
more to be admired . and 
enjoyed than used." 

These are ideas, the Childs 
feel, that must be experienced 
to be understood.

The musical review Rap 
Master Ronnie, by Gary 
Trudeau and Elizabeth 
Swados, has been brought 
back for an encore run at the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
This funny and touching show 
will be lighting the boards 
until May 31. 

Rap is packed back to back 
with witty, incisive songs that 
can cut like a feather or tickle 
like a knife. The singing is 
clear, the music well played 
and the audience response 
indicates that the message of 
biting satire is coming over 
loud and clear. One by one the 
leading point of Reagan 's 
legacy are set up and knocked 
down. Women, Grenada , 
cheese, Central America, acid 
rain, Star W ars, cowboy, 

Rappin' with Ron 
Beirut, etc., are transformed 
into living characters who sing 
their diverse problems, 
successes, failures. The songs 
range broadly in style, from 
spiritual to jazz to punk to 
pop. All this diversity in style 
reflects with the differing 
characters who are singing. 
Many songs are hilarious, 
others deeply touching, in a 
Trudeauvian, Doonesbury-
esque way. Nearly all are 
i nsighful a s well as 
entertaining. 

The players are excellent. 

by snydley whiplash 
Light on their feet, clear 
voiced, they carry the show 
with fast-paced, upbeat 
performances. Rap Master 
Ronnie is worked like a full 
ship in perfect running order; 
songs flow one into another 
with only a heartbeat's pause 
for applause between. 
William Anton, as Ronald 
Reagan, pulls off a delightful 
burlesque of the president, 
" rapping" his lyrics in 
hilarious imitation of the real 
thing. Jo Anne Reeves as 
Nancy Reagan stands ever-

smiling by her man, helping 
him up and down the stairs, 
prompting him in his ear, 
getting her own song about 
"my kids" fighting free from 
drugs. 

The ensemble, consisting of 
10 players, performs all the 
other characters in the show, 
working with the president or 
going solo while Ron's off 
sleeping somewhere. Ensem-
ble members are characters 
who must live under the 
Reagan safety net , or 
members of the administra-

tion, or reporters at a press 
conference where Master 
Ronnie raps his facts and 
figures wrong, or a graduating 
class of college seniors to 
whom Ron raps a commence-
ment song/ speech, or the 
Secrd Service, or a Marine in 
Beirut, and on and on the 
ensemble moves through all 
these different characters with 
apparent ease, seeming never 
once to drop a word or miss a 
cue. All the while they are 
sketching characters with 
song and movement in time to 
the music that plays behind 
them. 

Good, simple costume 
changes highlight the actors' 
and actresses' changes from 
one song into another. The 
lighting and sound create the 

-------------- ------ ----------------------------, feelings of the different 
scenes / songs . The stage 
extends in front of a stairway 
that leads up to a kind of 
presidential chair -i n -th e -
clouds. The differing design 
factors all appear to work very 
well together, giving the show 
a strong, forward moving 
energy which the actors and 
musicians pick up and run 
away with . From the 
beginning entrance to the last 
curtain call, this is definitely a 
hot rap for the Rep. 

If you like Mint 
Milanos, then time is 
awasting. Get your 
shit together and 
write for Hiatus.

War is more than Hell 
by david koons 

Two Faces of War, a 
collection of photographs by 
John Hoagland and Richard 
Cross, brings to the Grove 
Gallery a masterful rendition 
of the horrors of war. 

When viewing the Grove 
Gallery's photo exhibit, Two 
Faces o{War, we are forced to 
feel pain. We taste, see and 
feel the work of war 
photographers Hoagland and 
Cross. Both men were "killed 
in action" (so to speak) and 
their work shows strong 
emotional energy. 

Photography plays on the 
human senses. The goal is to 
embod y in one frame the 
whole essence of a moment. In 
both emotional and physical 
terms, this is the embodiment 
of the craft. 

Each photo is full of 
impact, brimming with 
emotion, overflowing with 
the sadness of wa r. The horror 
of war, the insanity so 
inherent, is overpowering.

The collection brings 
these experiences too close 
for us to comfortably step 
back and analyze the 
situation, to formulate our 
own detached opinions. We 
try to recoil from the face of 
a bereaved mother staring 
out at us, her face etched 
with utter despair as she 
cradles her dead daughter in 
her arms. In the 
background, eternally 
waiting, is the cemetery, the 
only universal symbol of 
war. 

At point blank range, we 
are forced to grapple with the 
true feelings and emotions of 
war. 

The technical excellence 
that these photographers took 
to Vietnam and Central 
America is clearly visible. 
Hoagland, a UCSD graduate 
of 1967, called himself a 
II front-line photographer." 
His images are immediate, full 
of the actions of battle. There 

NEED 
EXTRA 
INCOME? 

is frantic motion, high energy 
and immediacy in Hoagland's 
images. He relies on color to 
bring out the front-line 
reality. Composition and 
angle are forgotten in a time of 
flying bullets and exploding 
bombs. 

Hoagland's last six shots are 
the most fearsome. Hoag-
land's death is brutally 
captured on film. 

Cross's work documents 
the emotional upheaval of 
war. His compositions are 
studied, structured to give the 
greatest emotional impact. 

This exhibit should be seen 
by all UCSD students. It is a 
class in life. The scenes are not 
pretty, and the Grove Gallery 
deserves credit for bringing 
this poignant art form to our 
campus. Stop by the exhibit 
between classes and feel the 
power of this exhibit. Gallery 
Hours are Tuesday through 
Saturday, 10 am to 5 pm.

RCC CORNER 
In an effort to "reach across the border," RCC is planning a tourof 

the University of Baja California at Ensenada, to take place on 
Monday,April 14th. In conjunction with this trip , we are holding a 
campus-wide book drive in order to acquire enough books for a 
substantial donation to the University'S library. 

We have several purposes for organizing this trip. First of all . we 
hope to build awareness on campus about students In other cultures 
and about the need that they might have. Secondly, we would like to 
let the University of Baja know that we have an interest and a 
concern in their institution. Last of all . we would like to establish and 
continue a relationship with the UniverSity campus In Ensenada. 

Con erning the book drive, we have contacted aU the departments 
on campus, requesting the contribution of any books that they have 
available. We also encourage tudent to take a part in thi worthy 
cause. A good way to get involved IS by asking one ?f your own 
professors whether they have any ~ooks - especl~lly .Ience 
reference books - which you could bnng to the Provost s Office for 
the b ok drive. 

1 here are twenty-five spaces available for tho e stude:1t who 
would like to go on the tour. Transportation will be provided ... all 
you need do is sign up at the Revelle Dean's Office and show up by
