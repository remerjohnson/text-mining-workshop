AIDS initiative: LaRouche tries again 
By SUSAN HYLEN 
s.JIw .... ' 

PrOposition 69, the AIDS initiative sup-
ported apin by conservative extremist Lyndon 
LaRouche, is raisina debate and a certain 
amount of name-callina across California as 
leJislators and health officials debate its merits. 

The proposition declares that carriers of 
AIDS or related viruses create a contagious 
situation and are subject to reportable disease 
regulation, quarantine and isolation. 

Jim Duree, a proponent of the bill and a 
press secretary for the Democratic Party, said 
in an interview that the main impact of the 
proposition is that it "invokes the same statutes 
for the health department [which are] already 
in effect, .. allowing officials to use powers they 
already posses to report all cases of AI DS to 
the State Department of Health Services. 

Duree is referring to California laws which 
r~ healtb care providers to report to the 
State the names of penons with certain com-
municable diseases. 

AIDS is currently not on this list, although it 
is on a separate list of unusual diseases which 
also must be reported. 

Mark Madsen, a spokesperson for the Cali-
fornia Medical Association, said the claim that 
Proposition 69 will simply add AIDS to the list 
of reported diseases is merely propaganda on 
the part of its proponents. He attributed the 
initiative to "non-medical people trying to 
scare you." 

Madsen said that the measure would force 
health officials to utilize the same powers they 
now use to quarantine children with other 
infectious diseases. Since AIDS is not yet cura-
ble, however, this new type of quarantine

State propositions: Almost $2.5 billion in bonds 
Proposition 71 - Appropria-

tions Limit Adjustment 
The amount of taxes most 

government entities in Califor-
nia, including the State, cities, 
counties, schools. and special 
districts, can appropriate (spend) 
each year is limited. The limit, 
which applies only to taxes 
and does not apply to debt ser-
vice on voter-approved general 
obliaations bonds, is adjusted 
for inflation each year usina the 
lower of the change in a) the Uni-
ted States Consumer Price index 
or b) California per capita per-
sonal income. 

The appropriation limit is also 
subject to population chanae. 
The state's limit must now talee 
into account the growth in aver-
age daily attendance of K-12 
schools districts and community 
colleges, to the extent that these 
factors exceed the percentage 
growth in statewide population. 
Local governments may include 
the growth in the number of 
people employed in their juris-
diction in the computation of 

their appropriation limit. 
Essentially, both local and state 

,overnments will be able, if Prop. 
71 passes, to spend more of the 
money that they receive each 
year in taxes. The state will be 
able to spend up to $700 million 
more next year, and an increas-
in, amount annually thereafter. 

Proponents ofthe proposition, 
who include State Superintend-
ent of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig, California Leaaue of 
Women Voters Carol J. Fede-
right and the American Associa-
tion of Retired Persons-Calif-
ornia, claim that the approp-
riations limiting mechanism is 
outdated. "California has 
chan,ed dramatically in the pa~t 
decade," they write. "Our senior 
population has almost doubled. 
. .. The existing limit, tied to 
national inflation, not Califor-
nia '5 economy, doesn't allow us 
to spend already-collected taxes 
on current problems." 

They also claim that Prop. 71 
is fair, and favors no special 

interests, and will, as is true, 
raise no taxes. 

Opponents claim that it is spe-
cial interests who will benefit 
most from Prop. 71, and they 
(public employee unions, ambi-
tious politicians) are out to des-
troy the "Gann Spending Limit. " 
They feel that larger salaries and 
pensions for government emp-
loyees will result ifthe measure is 
passed, and that "huae tax in-
creases" will be on the way. Op-
ponents include Paul Gann and 
past president of the California 
Chamber of Commerce John 
Hay. 

Proposition 72 - Emerlency 
Reserve and Transportation Set-
Asides 

Proposition 72, like 71. raises 
the state government's approp-
riations limit, only this time the 
primary goal is highway im-
provement rather than an in-
crease in the General Fund (total 
amount of money available for 
goverment expenditures). 

The measure requires that net 

revenues from the sales tax on 
motor vehicle fuels be used for 
public transportation (highways, 
streets, mass transit) im-
provements only. Also, a two-
thirds vote ofthe Legislature or a 
majority vote of the people will 
be required to raise motor vehi-
cle fuel tax,es. and the LeJislature 
will be prohibited from lowering 
sales tax rates. 

The proposition also calls for 
three percent of the total state 
General Fund budget to be placed 
in reserve in case of emergencies 
and economic uncertainties . 
The three-percent reserve would 
amount to about $200 million in 
1988-89, about $430 million in 
1989-90, and ever-increasing 
amounts thereafter. In recent 
years, the amount of money 
placed in the reserve has been 
between one-and-a-half and three 
percent. 

Paul Gann, who sponsored a 
successful 1979 amendment that 
forced the state budget to grow 
at the same rate as the popula-

tion and inflation, is also behind 
Proposition 72. 

He argues that 72 will ensure 
that the taxes paid at the pumps 
will be used for highways instead 
of other, non-related purposes,

U C Santa Cruz inaugurates Stevens 
as new chancellor 

The University of California inaugurated Robert B. 
Stevens as the fifth chancellor of the Santa Cruz 
campus in a public ceremony held on Wednesday, 
June I , in the campus's Upper Quarry Amphi-
theater. . . 

Stevens is a prominent legal historian who was 
president of Haverford College. a Quaker institution 
in Pennsylvania, for ten years before coming to 
Santa Cruz in July 1987. 

Mary P. McPherson, president of Bryn Mawr 
Colleae, gave the ceremony's main address, " From 
Quakers to Earthquakers - a Friendly Remem-
brance." 

Born in England in 1933, Chancellor Stevens was 
an undergraduate at Oxford and did his graduate 
work at Oxford and Yale. He practiced law in both 
London and New York before being appointed to 
the faculty at Yale where he taught from 1959 to 
1976. He was provost at Tulane University for two 
years before becoming president of Haverford in 
1978. 

In addition to being a legal advisor to the East 
African Community in Tanzania for six years,

number of national organizations, including the U.S . 
Merchant Marine Academy and the National Board 
of Medical Examiners. He currently is a member of 
the Council on the Humanities. and serves as 
chairman of the Research Committee of the 
American Bar Foundation. He is co-cditor of the 
lAw in Context series and has written extensively in 
various branches of law, primarily legal history.

Shiley Eye Center approved 
for UCSU campus 

The University of California Board of Regents 
today approved a proposal for a major new eye 
center on the UCSD School of Medicine campus. to 
be named the Shiley Eye Center in recognition of a 
leadership gift of 51 million toward the facility from 
philanthropists Donald P. and Darlene V. Shiley. 

The Regents also appointed the firm of Anshen 
and Allen as executive architect for the S7.06 million 
facility. which will contain approximately 32,144 
square feet, including patient care space. research 
laboratories, classrooms. conference rooms and 
offices of the UCSD department of ophthalmology. 
The center will centralize programs currently. located 
in several sites on the UCSD campus in La Jolla and 
at the UCSD Medical Center in Hillcrest. 

"In a few short years, we have auembled a team 
of faculty members who are highly respected leaders 
both in research and the care of patients," said 
Stuart 1. Brown. M.D .• chairman of ophtalmology. 
"With the expansion of our research effort, the 
steady increase in our patient care commitment, and 
growth of our educational programs. additional 
space and a facility where our efforts can be 
consolidated arc critcally needed." 

The department hu a research budget of 
approximately SI.8 million, placing it among the 
country's top ranking research programs dedicated 
to diseases of the eye, considering the size and 
relative youth of the department. Each physician on 
the faculty also conducts federally sponsored 
research. resulting in a comprehensive patient care 
program at the leading edge of medicine. In 
addition. the department's teaching programs are 
among the nation's most competitive. 

The clinical practice lop approximately 45,000 
patient visits per year, including patients referred 
from around the United States and the world for 
specialized treatment of difficult diseases and 
complications. 

Research at the Shiley Eye Center will encompass 
the study of glaucoma, cancer. macular 
degeneration, optic neuritis and cataracts; the 
treatment of injury and trauma to the eye; the 
continued development of new ophthalmologic 
equipment; a arowinl program in molecular biology; 
and special studies of eye disease u a complication 
of disorders such al diabetes and AIDS.

Continued from pale 1 
her record as mayor. 

"There's a tremendous difference[in experience]," 
charged Morrow. "She came into the city council 
when she was a very young lady, and I helped her, 
but she's never had any experience outside ofthat," 
added the challenger, who was on the city council 
for 12 years and has "had a law office for 28 years." 

Regarding O'Connor's experience u Mayor, 
Morrow added that "in two years' time, she hu 
done more to indicate that she is not capable of 
doing it [her job as mayor] than most people could 
do in four years." 

O'Connor disagrees completely with Morrow's 
charges, pointing to her accomplishments u mayor 
as proof of her abilities. "I have a different Ityle of 
leadenhip," she said, adding that her actions have 
been effective, but often not hiply publicized. 

The Mayor cited the problem of the homeless. 
the Interim Development Ordinance (IDO). 
increased police protection, and the addition of 
parkland and open space areas u a few of her 
accomplilhments as mayor. To combat the home-
le.s problem. "We have one oCthe mOlt innovative 
programs in the country." O'Connor said. "We 
provide beds for anyone when the temperature 
drops below 35 degrees." . 

"The IDO came out of my office ... It was a 
concept that wu put into action," she continued, 
referring to the arowth-limiting re,ulation. During 
her time u mayor, "I've added over 1,400 acres of 
park and open space," O'Connor concluded. 

These two candidates do agree on lome impor-
tant issues; both feel that managin, San Diego's 
growth is a crucial issue, and both have ideu on 
how to accomplish this. Both are also Democrats. 
although neither has made a point of stating this 
during the campaign. 

There are several other ilsues which separate the 
candidates, however. They differ on the question of 
building a 1CC0ndary sewage treatment plant, with 
O'Connor .upportillJ the proposal' and Morrow 
termin, it "unnCCCll&ry." They also disaaree on 
proposition A, the proposal for a sales tax increase 
to pay for more jail.pace. with O'Connor favonng 
the increase and Morrow opposina it. 

Both candidates are confident about tomorrow'. 
election, sayin, that they fcclan outri,ht win (get-
ting over SO percent of the vote) is pOllible. Realis-
tically. however, the best Morrow can probably 
hope for is to prevent O'Connor from scorin, a 
complete victory, and force her into a runoff in the 
fall. 

Measure asks for 5776 million 
to help save the wilderness 
By MAUREEN SPURR 
SI~Wrltw 

"To wait until money is put 
aside to acquire lands tha.t are in 
jeopardy would be to lose them. 
I like to call it 'planning for pos-
terity; "said San Diego Super-
visor Susan Golding about Pro-
position 70, the Wildlife, Coastal 
and Park Lands Conservation 
Act. 

Proposition 70, which was 
placed on the ballot by initiative, 
would authorize a general obli-
gation bond issue of S776 million 
to provide funds for acquisition, 
development. rehabilitation. 
protection. or restoration of 
park, wildlife. coastal, and natu-
ral lands in California. Funds 
from bond sales would be 
dispersed by several state con-
servation agencies. AIIumina the 
bond is sold at 7.S percent inter-
cst, it will cost S 1.4 billion to pay 
it back. 

"San Die,o comprises 8.2 per-
cent of tbe California popula-
tion, and only S.S pcn:eDt oCtbe 
S776 million of Proposition 70 
,OCI to San Diqo Couaty. If

speDt on acquisition., not money 
to mamtam tile IaDd aacI pub 
we already have," Kip Solinlky, 
California Chamber of ColD-
mcn:e spokespenon said. 

Solinsky, who oppmcs 70, 
maintains that tbe method that 
lpecial interest grou.. used to 
get this bond initiative on tbe 
baUot is questionable, and that 
the legislature, not special inter-
cst arou .. , should place bond 
initiatives on the ballot. 

"The cost of S776 million in 
general obliption bonds will be 
between $1.1 and $1.3 billion, 
paid by taxes Irom you and me," 
said California Farm Bureau 
spokes penon Clark Bigs, ex-
plaining his opposition to Pro-
position 70. 

Bigp reiterated Solinsky's 
I'CUOn for oppoaition, sayin, that 
85 percent of tbe state's ellisting 
parks have no aencral plan for 
public IIIC. He mentioned his 
opposition to 'pet projects' put in 
by special interest groups and 
not discuaed with State Park 
planncn who historically have 

advised the legislature on spend-
ing priorities. 

In regards to the 5.S percent of 
the funds to be distributed to 
San Diego County Biggs said, 
"We are going to pay $40 for 
each man. woman, and child in 
San Diego County for the next 
20 years. This tells San Diego 
volers that we are going to pay 
for someone else's parks." 

Nearly 2S groups are in favor 
of Proposition 70. and only a few 
oppose it. Proponents feel that 
sensitive lands. wetlands, can-
yons. and the accompanying rare 

would be acquired. say the pro-
ponents, by submitting applica-
tions to the State. 

When asked if the jurisdictions 
and fund allotments seem fair, 
Supervisor Golding answered, 
"Yes. these have been carefully 
negotiated before they were put 
on the ballot. It was not done 
casually or without a areat deal 
of forethought. These were the 
result of a long series of negotia-
tions, and were decided on a per 
capita basis." 

Opposition complaints include 
disapproval of using the initia-
tive process to bypass the Legis-

"I think it is an important move to 
acquire valuable lands that are in jeo-
pardy of development. It

ten the State's credit ratin,. The 
act is COItly, and competcs with

jects, and Dot aU jurisdictions

In addition, it is arped that 
more of tbe revenues Fneratcd 
by the act should be used for the 
development of existing parks 
rather than for tbe acquisition of 
new lands. Further, opponents 
.... e. some of the funds will be 
available through competition to 
private land conservation foun-
dations. 

"The money has to come from 
IOmewhere." replied California 
Taxpayer's Association Spokes-
person Carol Ross when asked if 
California taxpayers would be 
repayinl the Fneral fund from 
which bonds are issued." 

"The reason we are opposed to 
this is because it is a unique and 
different one, and the appropria-
tion is through initiative. If this 
becomes a trend. then it is the 
beJinning of no control on the 
part of the State." Ross added. 
According to Ross. the concern 
amonl taxpayers is that taxes 
will have to be increased to repay 
the general fund if bond issuan-
ces continue in this manner. 

AIDS: Measure hotly debated 
COIIIia- rro. .... I 
would be permanent. 

AIDS Education Specialist for 
CMA Elizabeth Zima stressed 
that "AIDS and HIV positivity 
are two different thinp," and 
expreaed concern that the initia-
tive "can constitute puncls for 
quaraDtine" of larae numbers of 
people. 

Zi ... said tbe COnfldeDtiality 
law Duree referred to only prohi-
bits the state from releasina the 
names of infcc:ted pcnGns to the 
public, and that it is required for 
physicians to report diaposcd 
AIDS patients to state and local 
officials. 

Proponents of 69 cite. u evi-
dence of the need for action. 
three cases in which medical tech-
nicians have been infected with 
the AIDS virus by simply bein, 
exposed to blood carryin, the 
HIV complex. Thcscproponcnts 

often cate,orizc the disease as 
easily communicable. 

Madsen, however. attributes 
these cascs to the category of 
"unexplained" cascs which he 
says constitute .06 percent of all 
AIDS victims. These are the 
people [who] just won' teU you" 
that they have beeD involved in 
hip-risk activities like IV drua 
usqeor hommcxual intercourse, 
accOrdinl to Madsen. The ref-
usal of these few people to tell 
docton about their lives is the 
only "common denominator ... 
there's nOlhinl else that links 
them toaethcr." Madsen said. 

Zima said that continuing 
education and tracking of the 
diluse under the current 
methods is necessary to stop the 
spread of AIDS. She said "peo-
ple need to know what HIV is ... 
they can catch it. and avoid 
catchin, it ." 

This ' education method "has 
already failed" accordinl to 
Duree. who calls for new educa-
tion programs aimed at those 
who do not know they are 
infected. He said current pro-
grams simply push for safe sex. 
but claims that "there is no safe 
lell except with an uDinfected 
person and that requires tat in,. "

presidential primaries are essentially over and there 
are no seriously contested Senate primaries. The 
San Diego Mayor's race is, as usual, an uncontested 
joke. That leaves the propositions as the most 
interesting items facing students on their Tuesday 
ballots. 

Proposition 66 - We recommend a "yes" vote on 
what is essentially a fait accompli; the measure 
would require that all county assessors be elected_ 
All are currently elected, but each county currently 
has the option to make the position an appointed 
one. Given the generally low level of attention paid 
to most county governments, elections keeps this 
important position which is open to corrupt 
influences, before the public eye. 

Proposition 67 - This measure would provide 
for increased penalties for those convicted of 
second-degree murder of certain "peace officers." 
It's part of an ongoing statewide effort to lock up 
"social problems" rather than deal with their source. 
There is no evidence that current penalties are 
inadequate. This is essentially more law enforcement 
grandstanding to the detriment of discussion of real 
social justice issues. We recommend a "no." 

Proposition 68 - Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) and Republican Governor 
George Deukmejian both oppose these campaign 
contribution and spending limits; our predisposi-
tion, therefore, is to support them. Brown and 
Deukmejian support a cynical system which has 
essentially put the legislature and the Governor's 
offices up for sale and enhanced their own power. 
This proposition would limit contributions and the 
amount of money candidates can spend for office 
and encourage more contributions from within 
legislative districts rather than from large state 
lobbying organizations. It's a long overdue reform. 
We recommend a "yes." 

Proposition 69 - All you need to know is that 
this measure could easily be interpreted as allowing 
the construction and implementation of a con-
centration camp system for gay men and intravenous 
drug users and that it is sponsored by wacko 
"politician" Lyndon LaRouche. We strongly recom-
mend a "no" vote. 

Proposition 70 - Natural undisturbed coastal 
and inland land is vanishing quickly in California; 
this initiative would- authorize $776 million in 
bonds to help save such land. Because of high 
interest rates, the state would incur a fairly sub-
stantial obligation, but the land may never be 
available again . It's worth it. We recommend a "yes" 
on 70. 

Propositions 71 and 71 - Deukmejian took 
office as a fiscal conservative, and like fellow 
conservative Ronald Reagan, has proceeded to run 
his budget into the ground. These initiatives would 
increase the amount of money available to the state 
government for its various operations through m~re 
realistic cost-of-living estimates and would requtre 
the state to operate with a three-percent reserve. We 
recommend a "yes" on both and that you seriously 
examine any Republicans running as "fiscal conserva-
tives" in the future. 

Proposition 73 - This is a chimera, an attempt to 
distract voters from the real reform of Proposition 
68 . It would ban public funding of campaigns, 
ensuring that we would continue to have the best 
legislature money can buy. Do not be distracted by 
the one overwhelmingly good idea in this proposi-
tion: the banning of those self-serving newsletters 
you get from office-holders. We recommend a "no" 
on 73. 

Propositions 74-77 - Highway, schools, veterans 
and earthquack safety bond issues. We recommend 
a "yes" on all.

Another A.S. 
Council Response 
Editor: 

The relationship between t~ A.S. 
president and the A.S. Council has 
been a popular issue. The point of 
view of the media and of the A.S. 
president has been expressed, but 
not that of the rest of the council. 
This is biased coverage. All sides 
should be considered. 

First, I'd like to address the claim 
that the "A.S. Council, made up 
mostly of Patterson supporters 
[made] an organized effort not to 
cooperate with [Dimmesdale's] ad-
ministration"( Guardian, May 31). I 
was a member of Team Unity, of 
which Johnny Patterson was also a 
member. I supported Patterson and 
was disappointed at his loss, but did 
not let it interfere with my working 
relationship with Maynard Dim-
mesdale. Nor did the other council-
members. We have not and will not 
take or organize a stand against 
Dimmesdale because we supported 
Patterson during elections . Any

conflicts that arise result from cur-
rent differences, not past election 
results. 

Next, I would like to discuss 
Dimmesdale's proposal "to cut pad-
ded A.S. salaries in favor of pro-
grams to benefit the student body." 
In his original proposition, Dim-
mesdale cut most A.S. salaries but 
raised his own by 2S percent. By 
increasing his salary this much he

Church of Christ 
Is Defended 
Editor: 

Without knowing any of the spe-
cifics of the allegations made by Ms. 
Williams in her letter, "Cult is on the 
Prowl" (Guardian, May 31), there 
are a few pertinent facts that readers 
should know before making any 
snap judgements about the churches 
of Christ. 

The churches of Christ sprang up 
all over the U.S. during the 1800s as 
preachers called for a departure from 

man-made creeds and dogmas and a 
return to the church ofthe New Tes-
tament. Unlike many denomina-
tions, the churches have no govern-
ing hierarchy beyond the local con-
gre,ational level. As a result, a 
particular practice of a given con-
gregation mayor may not be repre-
sentative of what one will find at 
other churches of Christ. 

The ideals of most political, reli-
gious and social institutions have 
been betrayed by their adherents at 
one time or another, but such 
betrayals in and of themselves do 
not nepte the principles upon which 
such institutions were founded . Water-
gate hasn't destroyed the presidency, 
nor has Chappaquidick nullified the 
legitimacy of representative govern-
ment. If the allegations Williams 
makes concerning the "hypnosis" of 
"one young man" by a specific 
church of Christ are true, I am sorry. 
In the end, though, the plea for a 
return to primitive Christianity still 
stands. The gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ contines to be "the power of 
God unto salvation."

OPINION 

How long have you been at UCSD? How many times have you 
changed your major? When will you graduate? 

Well, I've been at UCSD for 
one and U/15 year. I have 
changed my major three times 
but one of them doesn't count. I 
started as pre-A M ES, wem to 
molecular biology and then a 
Muir special projects major, but 
because of bureaucratic things 
I'm back to molecular biology.

Jackson and 
Black Power 

The recent spate ofletters com-
menting on Jesse Jackson's bid 
for the presidency, whether pro 
or con, have one thing in com-
mon-they have neglected to 
point out the primary signifi-
cance of Jackson's campaign -
its relationship to the Black 
Liberation Movement. 

Jackson's campaign is not just 
another presidential campaign. 
One stark difference is Jackson's 
base: it gOCl well beyond the 
White middle class core of sup-
pon that both the Dultakil and 
Bush campaiJDI feature. What 
Jackson's campai,n really is, as 
African American scholar and 
activist Amiri Baraka bas point-
ed out, is the civil rights move-
ment of the eighties. 

Jesse Jackson is the personifi-
cation of Black America's desire 
for democracy. Before and since 
southern Reconstruction in the 
1870s - the brief period durin, 
which African Americans for the 
fint time in the history of this 
nation enjoyed the same rights 
and liberties afforded White 
Americans - Black people in 
this country have been denied 
democracy. What I mean by 
democracy is everything ranging 
from the right to vote to freedom 
of speech and association. 

It was not until the 19SOS and 

J've been here - well, this is 
my second year. I haven't really 
declared a major but they have 
me down as physics - I don't 
know how that happened. The 
counselor said J have to declare 
something now and 10 just keep 
it as physics umil J decide. I'm 
thinking about communications.

60s that the overt institutional-
ized forms of racism were abo-
lished by law. However, more 
subtle forms still exist today, 
such as the low quality education 
offered to the predominantly 
minority youth in our inner cities. 
African Americans typically are 
restricted to jobs which offer 
little upward mobility, and Black 
youth are exposed to a constant 
barrage of negative imagery by 
way of the media's perpetuation 

. of disparaging stereotypes. 
In the main, inequality for 

African-Americans and other 
Third World people exists today 
largely due to conscious efforts 
by the ruling elite to keep people 
of color in a subservient position 
in order to reap greater profits 
from their labor. It is no coin-
cidence that GeorJC Bush told 
Chicano and Black youth at 
Garfield High (the school fea-
tured in the recent movie Stand 
And Deliver) that they need not 
go to college in order to succeed, 
that America needs landscapers 
and construction workers, to~. 

To a large degree, Black Ame-
rica has been kept on the bottom 
of society due to the denial of 
political power. Historically, a 
variety of measures have been 
employed to keep Black Ameri-
cans from the polls-ranging 
from the whip to bureaucratic 
voter registration procedures. 
This is changing, though, and to 
a lar,e degree it is changing due

John Lee 
Senior, Revelle 

Council 
Continued from pale .. 
raised the total budget for A.S. 
salaries. This does not free money 
for student programs. If any-
thing, it detracts from the money 
available for them. Many of the 
other salary issues were disputed 
because Dimmesdale did not 
have the authority to make the 
changes he attempted. The coun-
cil could not support illegal 
actions such as these. 

It haa been insinuated that the 
council voted down Bard-Alan 
Finlan'. appointment to the 
position of Student Advocate as 
a attack a .. irdt Dimmesdale. 
This claim is hard to justify_ 
While much of the arguments 
centered around the appointment 
process, I feel that Finlan is a 
poor candidate for the position. 
Contrary to Dimmesdale's claim 
that "the question of whether 
Bard-Alan Finlan was qualified 
was never addressed," (discussed 
this very issue at the meeting. I 
would also like to clarify Dim-
mesdale's claim that "everyone 
had <lecided on a vote before 
Finlan had a chance to explain 
himself or his qualifications. ~ I 
was well aware of his qualifi-
cations, as were most council-
members, when I made my 
decision. I did not feel he would 
do an adequate job for the 
students. The council voted him 
down because of how he was 

J graduated already, but I did 
change my major once, from 
EECS to Cognitive Science. I 
also chanf(ed from Revelle to 
Warren my last year. J was at 
UCSD for six years. 

John HOUlton 
Graduate, Warren 

This is my jirst year. I came in 
as an undeclared major, and now 
I'm a pre-communications. J hope 
it will take me four years total. 
That s what my father hopes it 
will take me, bUI it could possibly 
btjive.

appointed or because he was not 
qualified, not because Dimmes-
dale favored him. 

Finally, I would like to address 
the specific issue of the presi-
dent / council relationship. When 
we disagree over an issue Dim-
mesdale often claims that while 
he is for the students, we are 
more concerned for our own 
image and are a "cliquish coun-
cil." I am greatly disappointed 
that Dimmesdale would resort 
to personal attacks against the 
council because he felt that he 
could not get his way. We, as 
individuals, vote in the way we 
feel would best benefit our con-
stituents. It is obvious that some 
students agree with Dimmes-
dale's views because they elected 

him. But students also elected 
the councilmem bers, so our ideas 
must carry at least an equal 
weight. The entire council is 
representative ofthe students and 
all views must be considered. 

The Guardian has an obli-
gation to print not only the A.S. 
president's point of view, but the 
students' point of view. The 
students elected 22 people, not 
one person. I would encourage 
the Guardian to print unbiased 
journalism and consult everyone 
involved. If Dimmesdale, and 
the Guardia", claim to be repre-
sentative of the students view, 
they must consult the students.

REVIEW 
Continued from pa,e I 
while simultaneously maintain-
ing a healthy reserve to fund 
those non-related purposes in 
case of urgent and unexpected 
needs. 

Bill Honig, California State 
PTA President Helen H. lind-
say, and CHP Association Pres-
ident Tom Noble are among the 
proposition's opponents, and 
they argue that 72 will benefit 
only "big developers and Sacra-
mento politicians." They claim 
that 72 will take S700 million 
away from "schools, law en-
forcement , health care and se-
niors," while Gann claims that 
money will be replaced by sur-
plus tax revenues. 

The 5700 million figure is based 
on fiscal year 1990-91, while the 
surplus tax revenues will come 
about because of a higher ap-
propriations limit, allowing the 
government to spend more of the 
money it takes in, rather than 
giving it back to taxpayers. 
Proposition 73 - Clmpal,n 
Fundin, Contribution Limits 

Similar to Proposition 68 in 
that it limits contributions to 
candidates for public office, 
Proposition 73 differs funda-
mentally from that measure by 
prohibiting the use of public 
funds by said candidates for the 
purpose of seeki ng elective office. 
Also, individual candidates may 
not give funds to other ca nd i-
dates, nor may their committees 
transfer funds to other com-
mittees. 

While it does limit individual'S 
and organization's campaign con-
tributions, 73 does not limit cam-
paign spending, which 68 does. 
However, 68 is non-binding if 
candidates do not adhere to 
campaign co ntr ibution limits. 
they will not receive matching 
funds, but they will not be break-
ing the law - 73, on the other 
hand, is binding. 

Proponents of 73 argue that 
the measure will reform Califor-
nia political campaign laws "with-
out giving your tax money to 
politicians," and they warn that 
the rival measure will "allow 
extremist candidates such as com-
munists or members of the Ku 
Klux Klan to have their cam-
paigns paid for with your tax 

dollars. " 
Opponents of 73 call it "the 

politicians' and special interest 
lobbyists' idea of "reform, Hand 
claim that the measure was spon-
sored by three incumbent politi-
cans who received over 52 mil-
lion in campaign money for their 
last elections. They ask, "Do 
these sound like sponsors of real 
campaign reform?" 

Proposition 74 - Deddeh 
Transportation Bond Act 

Historically, California has 
used a pay-as-we-go method to 
finance the state's railroads, high-
ways, streets, and roads. Propo-
sition 74 changes that by calling 
for a bond issue of one billion 
dollars to provide funds for capi-
tal improvements of California's 
transportation system. 

The cost of repaying the bond's 

lilt I" Bond Act of 191. 
Of the 5800 million the Schools 

Facilities Bond Act would raise, 
at least S590 million would be 
used to construct new school 
facilities, no more than SI20 mil-
lion would be used to modify 
existing school facilities, no more 
than 550 million would be used 
to purchase portable classrooms, 
and no more than 540 million 
would be used to buy air-condi-
tioners for year-round schools. 

The state would have to ' pay 
back about 51 .4 billion over the 
next 20 years to cover both inter-
est and principal. 

Governor Deukmejian and Bill 
Honig support 75. They claim 
that over the next two years, 
California will be home to over a 
quarter of a million new stu-
dents, and 75 will provide some 

Fr_.aya - California motorists will benefit from Proposition 74. 
say proponents of the measure. 
principal and interest will ap-
proach S 1.8 billion , and would 
probably be spread out over the 
next 20 years . 

Senator Wadie Deddeh spon-
·sored the bill, and other propo-
nents include Governor George 
Deukmejian. They argue that 74 
will provide money to "meet 
today's unique transportation 
challenges," not "replace historic 
funding methods." 

Opponents, among them for-
mer Governor Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown, call 74 a "revolutionary 
departure from a decades-old 
pay-as-you-go tradition," and 
say that the state will be led 
"down [a] road of fiscal mis-
management ... 

Proposition 75-School Fac-

oi the facilities those • ',dents 
need. 

They also claim that Caht ur · 
nia can easily handle the addi- I 
tional financial burden placed 
on it by 75, in part because "Cali-
fo rnia has the lowest level of 
bonded debt of any large indus-
trial state in the union." 

Finally, they say that 75 con-
forms to the letter and the spirit 
of the Gann spending limit, a 
point which Ted Costa, an as-
sistant to Paul Gann, disagrees 
with. Costa calls bonds an "end-
around"the Gann spending limit , 
and claims that California tax-
payers are "overburdened" with 
a massive public debt." 

Costa also rebuts proponent's

REVIEW 
Continued from pace 7 
arluments that 75 will not raise 
taxes by pointinl out that some-
one, sometime, will have to 
pay the bond, and it will end up 
costing much more (about S400 
million) to retire the debt than 
the measure will raise. 
expect accountability 'from the 
state's educational bureaucracy," 
Costa writes. MBut. thus far,l've 
seen very little." 

Proposhion 76 - Vet_ 
Bond Act of 1911 

About 6,300 additional vete-
rans will be able to participate in 
the Cal-Vet proaram, which aids 
veteran's financinl of farm and 
home purchases, if the 5510 mil-
lion Veterans Bond Act is passed. 

Veterans have bistorically 
assumed the entire burden of 
paying off Cal-Vet bonds, sales 
of which belan in 1921, at no 
direct cost to the taxpayer. If, 
however, veteran's payments 
don't cover the full cost of repay-
inl the bond, the state win usc 
taxpayers' money to make up tbe 
difference. 

The only arlUment apinst 76 
is made by conservative Senator 
H.L. Richardson, himself a war 
veteran, who says that "the state 
and nation are both up to tbeir 
bazoos in debt and only a bozo 
would want more. 

In fact, while debt would be 
assumed by tbe state, it has aevC'r 
had to repay Cal-Vet , bonds 
accordinl to tbe measures prop-
onents, and the state is merely a 
COIilner. 

PropolHloa 77 -CaUfomia 
Eutllqaue Salety and Houaial 
lionel Act 011,.. 

The 5 I SO million raised by this 
bond would be used to both help 
owners of unsafe housing reha-
bilitate their buildings, and be 
loaned out to those who wish to 
purchase unsafe housing so they 
may have the money to bring the 
building up to safety standards, 

Proponents, including As-
sembly Speaker Willie L. Brown 
Jr., point to the thousands of 
unsafe, unreinforced masonry 
buildinp (25,000 in San Fran-
cisco alone), and claim that some 
875,000 apartments in Califor-
nia need to be rehabilitated to 
meet basic safety standards. 

Opponents, mostly Libertar-
ian, ask that not only this, but all 
other bonds be voted down by 
Californians. "Democratic and 
Republican politicians are never 
happier than when they are 
spendinl the taxpayer's money," 
they write. 

They claim that 77 is "unne-
cessary in any evcnt. Government 
planninl and bureaucratic ac-
tions have reduced the supply of 
low-income housinl and now 
they want our bard-c:arned 
money to be spent tryinl to cor-
rect tbe problem ... 

Proponents disaaree, saying 
that 77 will "have lovernment 
act to avert a crisis, not simply 
pay to clean up after one." They 
feci it is better to spend the 
moaey now on prevention than 
to spcDd it later on disaster relief 
and claim that Sill million was 
speDt by the JOVCI11ment after 
the recent Los Angeles eartb-
quake.

Supreme Court tOday, 
As a White student and history

history of White people in this 
country as it has related to Blacks 
and to Black social movements. 
There have always been three 
types of Whites- oppressors, fence-
sitters, and democrats , 

In the 1950s, idealistic White 
students, inspired by the Black-
led Civil rights movement, once 
alain headed South to join with 

courageous Black youths who put 
their lives on the line to fight for 
a future society which would 
guarantee equality to all. And 
now, in the 1980s, in an America 
that is just now beginning to 
emerle from the moribund and

Americans arc once alain being

Subliminal RaRer boosts students' scores 
, 

~ppealing to the subconscious 
through optical illusions . 

By JULIE MUNRO 
ColllrlbutUt, FHiurn Editor 

I t has been used to sell pop-corn and soda at the movies, to appeal to consumers' egos 
in advertising, and to make peo-
ple more lifelike in famous paint-
ings. Today, however, Dana 
Osman has invented a use for 
subliminal suggestion that has 
been shown to improve students' 
performances. 

It is sub-visual enhancement 
paper, and it's available now for 
only a few cents more per sheet 
than normal paper. 

Osman has developed a tech-
nique for coding this paper with 

Students who were 
given the experimen-
tal paper scored over 
11 pOints higher than 
the control group. 

subliminal messages that are 
invisible to the conscious eye 
under even the brightest of light-
ing, yet the effects of these mes-
sages on people's behavior have 
proved quite beneficial for a 
number of uses. 

Osman's sub-visually enhanced 
paper stimulates the formation 
of "subjective-contour" illusions 
that do not physically exist but 
are optical illusions created by 

the human eye. 
To describe how the messages 

are perceived, Osman explained 
that there are two different types 
of vision - central focus vision 
and peripheral vision. The cen-
tral focus vision can only see one 
tiny area at a time, an area on 
which the eye is always con-
centrating. 

"It takes quite a bit of effort to 
concentrate on and be aware of 
those things which lie in your 
peripheral vision," Osman said. 

"When you look at our paper," 
Osman went on, "you are in fact 
seeing with your naked eye, as 
such, the images we put in there. 
But [the subliminal messages ar~ 
created] in such a manner that 
you can't look at them and see 
them with your focused vision." 

Because the central focus 
vision is used all the time, it is not 
as sensitive as the peripheral 
vision. For example, images in 
the dark are more easily picked 
up by the peripheral visioD. 

Although Osman" actual 
process of formulating nblimi-
nal messqes is still undisdoled, 
he says it is "totally different aACI 
unique from .")'thing else that's 
being done ill visUlhllbliminals." 

Previous technll!ues have 
relied on existjng images in which 
messages are hidden or flashed. 

Osman's sub-visual enhance-
ment can be put into all types of 
regular paper, including enve-
lopes, posters, post-it pads, and 
books. The messages call atten-
tion to or emphasize whatever is 
written on the paper. 

7 
v 

For example, the word Impor-
tant could be put on a phone 
message to increase the likeliness 
that the call is returned, Osman 
said. Osman has conducted na-
tionwide tests to prove that these 
messages are actually perceived 
and responded to. 

Students of an independent 
study course at Auburn Univer-

"There is a ratio 
between conscious de-
cision and the effect of 
the subliminal stimuli." 

-Dana Osman 

sity, Alabama were randomly 
divided into two aroups. One 
group was givell tile course 
material on su.visuaHy en-
ha'" paper while ... other 
was ,h the same ma1erial on 
regular,.... 

Toward ta. end of the semes-
ter, students were tested, a,.s 
tho. with Osman's paper Kored, 
on the average, oYer It ponti 
higher than the coatrol poap. 
The paper.....s bad the me~ 
I can.,,, this is euy; l.wIJl 
muter Mis; and I'll do it now. 

The paper's ab1lity to boost 
self-esteem was testecl on a group 
of Arizona students. The group 
was randomly divided in half 
and then further split into "nor-
mar' achievers and ··under" 
achievers. The two groups were 
given the widely used Rosenberg 

v 
A Kanizsa triangle A subjective triangle 

with curved sides. 
These illustrations are dramatic examples of how messages can 

be hidden in existing images. When scanning each of the above 
figures without ~oncentrating on anyone point, an opaque triangle 
will appear. Each triangle will seem to cover parts of the black 
circles and black triangles. Although they appear to be brighter than 
the background and have razor-sharp edges, the triangles are just 
illusions. Sub-visual enhancement paper relies on optical illusions 
like these which are created by tt18 human eye, Positive, supportive

paper. 

Self-Esteem test. To convey to 
the experimental group that they 
were loved and thereby boost 
their self-esteem, the words I 
Love You and a heart were put 
on their sub-visually enhanced 
paper. Of the four groups, the 
"under" achievers given the 
enhanced paper scored highest, 
34.7 percent higher than the 
"under" achi~rs siven regular 
paper. The "normal" achievers 
with enhanced paper scored over 
13 percent higher than those with 
regular paper. 

The enhanced paper was also 
tested in a sales scenario by Dr. 
Sidney Weinstein, a neuropsy-
chological researcher. Two des-
criptions of new candies were 
written on both regular and sub-
visually enhanced paper. The 
enhanced paper contained the 
message, Buy. The subjects were 
given one with and Qne without 
the message. Efta Mkr switch-
ing the descri , there was a 
16-pcrcent in_se in sales for 
the Cllldy with paper. 

osaua said that 19-to 15 years 
ago peeple thouSh suW.inal 
messagel would ... tJtem to 
""Jparch .. beyond all reason 
_ buy. product" that was 
aMrtised with a Buy message. 
lt is now known that there is a 
"ratio between the magnitude of 
the conscious decision and the 
effect of the subliminal stimuli," 
Osman said. As the significance 
of the conscious decision in-
creases, the influence of sublimi-
nal messages diminishes. 

Subliminal stimuli can have a 
great influence, however, when 
the subject has a predisposition 
iii a particular direction, accord-
ing to Osman. For example, col-
lege students would generally like 
to do well in their classes. Because 
of this inclination, said Osman, 
the simplest of messages, such as 
It'seasyor You '1/ master iI, have 
tremendous and instantaneous 
effects. 

This paper is not a crutch, 
Osman insisted. "We don't give 
them the ansM:r5 ... we said, 
Yo.u can do ;t, and they did it. 
Our paper didn't do it."The stu-
dents were simply aided by the 
power of positive thought, 
Osman explained. "The mind is 
an extraordinary, powerful 
thina," Osman said. 

Olman's interest in subliminal 
perception began 20 yean ago 
when his New Jersey State Col-
lege friend, an artist, explained 
to him how Rembrandt created 
the lifelike paintinls they saw in 

~he Met in New York. His friend 
even demonstrated Rembrandt's 
technique of paintina a portrait 
by starting with the skull and 
layering the paint over it, to 
show that the eye perceives more 
than the surface. 

Disappointed with the repeti-
tiveness of college, Osman left 
New Jersey State in hia third 
year. He became a dealer of fine 

a~t and collectibles, and refur-
~~ r ... Mlomobiles.

introduced six new gems into the 
marketplace. He owns another 
business which produces a 
gourmet variety of escargot, and 
a third development which 
creates images on stone or glass, 
called photo-etching. 

In 1983 Osman learned about 
a company called "Super Paper" 
which marketed paper with sub-
liminal messages like Love, Sex, 
Hire, Buy and Pay as novelty 
items. He ordered some of the 
paper and found it to work. 
When he used the paper in his 
business billing, accounts he had 
been waitina on were suddenly 
paid, he said. 

Osman explained that when 
there were three choices to which 
someone was indifferent, such as 
among three different bills to be 
paid, that little stimulus of a sub-
liminal message was enouah to 
catch the person's attention. 

Osman bought the company 
and redeveloped the manufac-
turing process so the messaaes 
would not have to be printed 
only on thick paper, previously 
necessary to conceal the image. 
He was then faced with the deci-
sion of what were the morally 
and ethically important appli-
cations. 

"You have a responsibility with 
this product," Osman said. "We 
realized very quickly people do 
not like .. . the use of such a tech-
nology to separate them [from] 

"The conscious mind 
is often a self-destruc-
tive tool. We set limita-
tions."

their money." 
Articles have been written 

about sub-visual enhancement 
paper in a number of publica-
tions, including Omn; magazine 
and The Wall Street Journal. 

Wilson Bryan Key will feature 
Osman's paper in his fourth book 
since the mid J960s about sub-
liminal messages. Norman Cou-
sins, Dean of the UCLA School 
of Medicine, who "lauahed him-
self out or two life-threatening 
diseases, has reviewed Osman's 
research, and a review of the 
technology for pendini research 
at UCLA is under way. 

Dr. Jonas Salk, most famous 
for developinl one of the two 
Polio vaccines and currently 
occupied with AIDS research, 
just sent Osman a letter express-
ina support for Osman's research 
and its medical potential to aid 
both the mind's ability to deal 
with-a problem and its ability to 
use the immune system to ward 
off problems. 

Osman is "very interested in 
any researchers at UCSD who 
have ideal they would like to

Year-end meeting Continued from pale 12 Although this technology is 

"so different from what the 
accepted science of education 
has understood," Osman feels 
students can "get more of what 
they're paying for in college" by 
using this paper. He is optimistic 
that the educational system will 
understand more each year about 
the effects of self-esteem and 
positive thought on students' 
achievement. 

The purpose of enhanced paper 
is to help people "use those pow-
ers that [they] already have," 
Osman explained. "The con-

20 Monday, June 6, /988 

T en selected as athletes of 
By PHIL GRUEN 
COfftributiff, Sports Editor 

Ten 'rriton athletes were select-
ed as Athletes of the Year last 
Thursday night at the annual 
UCSD Athletics Awards Night 
held at Olsen Field. Because some 
of th individual athletic per-
formances this year were so out-
standing, the award selection 
deemed it necessary to select ten 
athletes from the 27 nominated 
for the award. 

In no particular order, here 
are the 1987-1988 UCSD Ath-
letes ofthe Year and their respec-
tive achievements. 

TIM VALLEZ 
Track &: Field 
This senior won the award hands 
down because of his incredible 
I :S 1.86 time and first place finish 
in the 800-meter at the National 
meet. Vallez becomes the first 
UCSD student to ever win an 
event at Nationals. 

CAROL LIPSON 
Volleyball 

Lipson, the senior setter of the 
women's volleyball team, played 
an instrumental part in leading 
her squad to it's second consecu-
tive National Championship. 
Incidentally, Lipson has played 
on three National Champion-
ships teams in her four-year 
career and, while earning her 
second All-American award in a 
row, was also named Volleyball 
Monthly's National Player of 
the Year. 

CHRISTINE BEHRENS 
Tennis 

Only a sophomore, Behrens 
once again earns this award by 
finishing second in the National 
Tournament. Her number-two 
.ranking is better than last year's 
number-three finish, and her 
outstanding leadership, talent, 
and attitude may lead her one 
more step to the National title 
next year. 

TRACY MULVANY 
Swimming. 

Topping all Tritons with 4S 
individual points, this senior led 
the women's swim team to a 
second place finish at Nationals. 
Mulvaney, (holder of five UCSD 
records), was recognized as Ath-
lete of the Year for the fourth 
consecutive year, making her the 
second Triton to ever accomp-
lish that feat. 
KIP FULBEK 
Swimming 

Collecting 39 individual points 
at the National meet, senior Kip 
Fulbek helped the UCSD men's 
swimming team to a third place 
finish in the country. The inspi-
rational leader of the team, Ful-
bek holds three UCSD swim-
ming records and sports a 3.608 
GPA. 
JANET HUGHES 
Volleyball 

Another superstar from the 
only UCSD National Champion-
ship team this year, Hughes is 
also a repeat winner of this

award. The senior middle-block-
er led the team in kills and blocks 
and was also named the 1987 
Reebok National Player of the 
Year. 
RICK NOWAK 
Baseball 

The ace of the Triton pitching 
staff, junior Nowak struck out a 
record 124 batters this season, 
including 18 and the side in three 
different innings in one game 
against Whittier, to earn his 
second consecutive selection as 
Athlete of the Year. Unless he 
gets drafted by a major league 
club, expect Nowak to terrorize 
opponents In his senior year. 

RANDY FRANKE 
Water Polo 

Nicknamed "The Franchise" 
by his coach,junior Franke saved 
the Tritons time and time again 
with his incredible ability in the 
goal. He was also named the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Player of the Year. 
SUSAN KRAMER 
Soccer 
. t::ven'thoulh she doesn't score 
goals left and right, this junior 
halfback thwarted opponents 
consistently throughout the year, 
making her the key to the Trit-
ons' defensive success. An All-
American, Kramer anchored the 

defense as it put together eight 
strailht shutouts and allowed 
only two loals to Division III 
opponents all season. 

PATTY HVRTT 
Softball 

A senior pitcher, Hurtt amas-
sed a 16-4 record with a 1.3S 
ERA to lead the women's soft-
ball team to its best sealon ever 
and a berth in the NCAA West 
Relionals. Hurtt also produced 
with the bat, hittina at a .400 clip 
and leading the team in slulling 
percentage, RBI, stolen bases, 
and triples. She also did not 
commit an error all season.

cheers, but deserved better. With 
bags over their heads and outfits 
that made them appear four feet 
tall, five members of the team 
danced in patterns to "La 
Bamba" in front of the crowd. 

By Phil Gruen 
COfftributinl Sports Editor 

Swimmer Tracy Mulvany 
and baseball pitcher Dave 
Adamson were selected Thurs-
day night for the highly 
coveted Alumni Senior 
Award, given each year to one 
male and female senior who 
had excelled in athletics, aca-
demics, and community in-
volvement during his or her 

college career. 
Mulvany, who hails from 

Chatsworth, California, has 
been selected as an All-Ameri-
can and Team MVP in each of 
her four years, as well as being 
team captain for two years. In 
National competition over the 
four years, she amassed 208 
total individual event points 
and placed in the top ten 21 
times, including three first 
place finishes, two second

place finishes, and five third 
place efforts. 

A quantitative and econo-
mic decision science major, 
Mulvany maintains an impres-
sive 3.794 GPA and plans to 
pursue an MBA at UCLA in 
1989. She has also been in-
volved with the Society for 
Advancement of Manage-
ment, and is a member of the 
Economics and Management 
Science Student Association. 

Adamson, a native of El 
Cajon, boasts a 17-3 record 
over his four years at UCSD 
(the best winning percentage 
in Triton history), including a 
S-l record last year to help 
bring the Tritions to the Col-
lege World Series. This year, 
his 6-2 record helped the Trit-
ons achieve a final ranking of 
eighth. 

Adamson also holds down 
a 3.33 GPA in his biochemis-
try and cell biology major. He 
also does volunteer work at 
the UCSD Medical Center, 
serves as chairman of the Tri-
tion Athletics Council, and 
headed the development of 
the first ever TritonFest. 
Adamson is married, and 
works 20 hours per week. He 
plans to enter medical school 
at either UCSD or Creighton, 
where, after finishing, he can 
really live up to his nickname 
"Doc." 

For the second year in a row, 
that rowdy group of individuals 
better known as the UCSD Base-
ball team captured the team 
talent show at the Athletics 
Award Night on Thursday. The 
victory came despite the efforts 
of the track &: field team, the 
softball team, and the women's 
soccer squad. 

The baseball (eam used nearly 
all their men to perform their 
version ofa Rick Davis Starlight 
Lounge act in Las Vegas. Re-
naming the song after Judy 
Sweet, the UCSD Director of 
Athletics who was required to sit 
in a chair while the players per-
formed around her, Rick Nowak 
sang while the rest of the players 
either backed up on vocals or 
danced ridiculously around the 
grass platform. 

Perhaps because of its seem-
ingly inherent originality and 
superb choreography, this act 
was easily the favorite among the 
crowd at hand. 

The second biggest cheer (the 
amount of the applause was the 
basis for the judging) went to the 
track &: field team, whose ener-
getic leader beat boxed while the 
rest of the team took turns rap-
ping. This skit had promise, but 
the lack of preparation was 
clearly evident. 

The women's softball team 
finished in third place among the 

The women's soccer team fin-
ished in last place, even though 
they had prepared their act in fall 
quarter. To the beat of RUN-
DMC's "Peter Piper," the team's 
members took turns rapping 
about others' individual achieve-
ments. The rap was written before 
their trip to the Nationals. Over-
all, the talent show was a healthy 
and enjoyable part of this prim-
arily informal event.
