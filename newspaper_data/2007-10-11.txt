The Office of Inspector General has 
slapped the University of California 
with a $450,000 fine for allowing an 
unauthorized scientist to send vials of 
the biological agent anthrax — which 
leaked upon being opened — in a ship-
ment from its Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory in 2005.

The breach occurred when the 
UC-operated laboratory shipped 1,025 
vials of bacillus anthracis — commonly 
referred to as anthrax — to a branch of 
the Midwest Research Institute in Palm 
Bay, Fla. in September 2005. After 
unpacking the shipment, employees 
discovered that two vials of the agent 
were uncapped, and one additional 
vial had a loose cap. A drop of liquid

The search for a new UC system 
president continued last week when a 
special advisory committee composed 
of several regents met in a closed 
session via teleconference to discuss 
potential candidates for the position.

The committee, led by UC Board 
of Regents 
C h a i r m a n 
Richard Blum, 
was formed in 
m i d - A u g u s t , 
shortly following 
current president 
Robert C. Dynes’ 
announcement 
of his intent to 
resign from 
office in June 
2008, or when his replacement is 
found. 

Dynes, who began his tenure in 
October 2003 as the 18th president 
of the University of California, will be 
taking a one-year paid administrative 
leave before returning to a full-time 
faculty position at UCSD. Reflecting 
on his time as president in a let-
ter to university academics and staff, 
Dynes cited several accomplishments 

achieved throughout his term, includ-
ing heightened transparency and 
public accountability, the retention of 
national laboratory contracts and the 
establishment of the UC Merced cam-
pus. He also addressed areas in which
his presidency had been weak, citing 
ethnic and gender diversity among the 
university’s senior administration as 
his chief concern.

A report by independent consult-
ing firm the Monitor Group released 
shortly before Dynes announced his 
resignation provided more severe cri-
tiques of his leadership, however, say-
ing that inflexibility to change, unnec-
essary duplication of jobs and public 
distrust of the university are among its 
most pressing problems.

Dynes also announced that UC 
Provost Wyatt R. Hume would act as 
the university’s chief operating officer 
until Dynes’ tenure is officially over. 

Following the Oct. 5 meeting, 
Blum commented on the advisory 
committee’s progress and its efforts to 
involve a broad spectrum of the uni-
versity populous in the process.

“The search for the new presi-
dent is proceeding,” Blum said. “Over 
the past month, the regents’ commit-
tee has had the opportunity to meet 
with advisory groups representing the 
various constituencies within the UC 
community. We have also begun to 
hear their ideas about candidates.” 

As outlined in university poli-
cies on presidential appointments, 
the regents’ advisory committee is 
required to “consult broadly with con-
stituent groups of the university from 
across all 10 campuses.” These include 

advisory committees representing 
and composed of faculty, students, 
staff and alumni, each of which is 
allowed up to 13 members, appointed 
by a constituency official. The regents’ 
committee has also sought input from 
campus chancellors and systemwide 
vice presidents.

“These conversations have been an 
illuminating and productive starting 
point and this dialogue will continue 
as the process moves forward in the 
coming months,” Blum said. 

Dynes himself emphasized the 
importance of such consultations, as 
well as the need for general involve-
ment of the UC community in the 
selection process at a meeting of the 
Berkeley Divisional Academic Senate 
on Oct. 4.

“In my opinion, it’s very important 
that the faculty, staff and students play 
a very active role in the choice of the 
next UC president,” Dynes said.  

In addition to consultations with 
students and faculty, the regents’ advi-
sory committee has sought to employ 
an independent search firm to assist 
in the process of identifying quali-
fied candidates for president. Sept. 21 
marked the deadline for these firms 
to bid for the opportunity, and the 
advisory committee will announce its 
decision at a later date. According to 
UC Office of the President spokes-
man Trey Davis, the firm will be con-
cerned with the coordination of the 
recruitment process, although names 
of potential candidates can be submit-
ted from any source.

“We’ll be hiring the search firm 
later this month,” Davis said. “These 

are human resource consulting firms 
that assist corporations and institu-
tions in identifying potential candi-
dates for senior management posi-
tions.”

University policy dictates that 
the regents’ advisory committee be 
comprised of 11 system officials, 
including by default Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Systemwide Alumni 
Associations President Eleanor Brewer, 
former Board of Regents  Chairman 
Gerald L. Parsky and student Regent 
Benjamin Allen. 

In addition to those serving on 
the committee by default, Blum chose 
six members of the UC Board of 
Regents to be included in the selec-
tion process.

The Leadership, Engagement, 
Activism and Development Center, 
known for helping students develop 
social and leadership skills outside 
of the traditional classroom environ-
ment, was disbanded this year after its 
funding was cut by the Registration 
Fee Advisory Committee in July.

“The pure and simple fact was that 
the cost associated with the center
exceeded the quality and quantity of the 
current programs offered,” RFAC Chair 
Garo Bournoutian said in an e-mail. 

The L.E.A.D. Center was created 
in the 2003-04 academic year, when 
the original proposal for a Student 
Leadership Engagement and Services 
Center was presented to RFAC, with a 
yearly operating cost of about $65,000 
— including one new staff mem-

ber’s salary. However, the committee 
reviewed the proposal and deemed 
that it failed to meet specific require-
ments, saying it created an unneces-
sary overlap of leadership and commu-
nication programs already provided by 
other organizations.

“Given these concerns, the RFAC of 
2003-04 decided not to fund the new 
SLES Center that year, but requested 
more information be provided and fur-
ther analysis done,” Bournoutian  said. 

The next year, former Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson decided to advance the cen-
ter’s development as a three-year pilot 
program with temporary funding. At 
the end of the trial period, the fund-
ing would have to be presented again 
to RFAC and the committee’s decision 
regarding funding the center in future 
years would be final, Bournoutian 
said.

Although the original SLES concept 
proposed only one new staff member, 
two additional staff members were 
hired for the center, nearly doubling its 
yearly operating budget. At that point 
in time, SLES was renamed L.E.A.D. 
and its mission statement and goals

Program to Preserve 
Fertility of Cancer Patients

UCSD, along with four leading 
academic medical centers, will par-
ticipate in a $21-million program 
funded by the National Institutes 
of Health to help protect fertility in 
women being treated for cancer.  

The national research, clinical 
and education program, called 
the Oncofertility Consortium, will 
launch nine projects over a five-
year period.  

“This grant will allow us to explore 
new methods to preserve a woman’s 
ability to conceive, before she under-
goes chemotherapy and radiation,” 
Jeffrey Chang, professor and chief 
of the division of reproductive endo-
crinology and department of repro-
ductive medicine, said in a press 
release.

Cancer treatments such as che-
motherapy or radiotherapy can dam-
age the ovaries and result in infertil-
ity.

TheUCSD Medical Center will lead 
a National Physicians Cooperative to 
unify participating universities and 
more than 20 medical centers in col-
lecting and preserving ovarian tissue 
and eggs.

Cancer patients participating in 
the 2008 clinical trial will have an 
ovary surgically removed before they 
begin cancer treatment. Twenty per-
cent of the ovarian tissue will be used 
for research and 80 percent will be 

preserved for the female patient to 
use in the future.  

Sugar Molecules Targeted 
to Help Detect Cancer
Funded by a $2.3-million grant 

from the National Cancer Institute, 
a new research project at the UCSD 
School of Medicine will focus on 
the early diagnosis and prognosis of 
lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancers 
using molecular glycans as biomark-
ers.  

Ajit Varki, distinguished professor 
of cellular and molecular medicine, 
and Richard Schwab, assistant pro-
fessor at UCSD’s Rebecca and John 
Moores Cancer Center, will lead the 
project. The NCI grant is part of a 
nationwide initiative to develop new 
methods of detecting and treating 
cancer through glycobiology — the 
study of the structure, biosynthe-
sis and biology of complex sugar 
chains.

“Despite many years of work 
by many investigators, there are 
no blood or urine markers that can 
reliably detect such cancers early 
enough in their course to make a 
difference in survival,” Varki said in 
a press release.  “Our studies have 
unveiled a promising new approach 
to this problem.”

Numerous studies comparing 
normal and tumor cells have shown 
that their glycan structures change 
with cancer development.

Last night’s A.S. Council meeting was dominated by a presentation about USA Today’s Collegiate 
Readership Program and a passionate 
plea in favor of reconsidering the con-
struction of transfer housing.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Dorothy Young, still glowing from the 
success of the D.R.E.A.M. Act rally in 
front of Geisel Library earlier in the day, 
provided an update about the council’s 
upcoming voter 
registration efforts 
to “help register 
UCSD students as 
they stand in line” 
during FallFest. 
Unregistered stu-
dents in line at 
RIMAC Arena 
next Friday should 
be prepared to make their first foray 
into representative democracy.

Thai Trieu of USA Today then took Thai Trieu of USA Today then took Thai Trieu
the floor to present a slideshow about 
the Collegiate Readership Program, 
which delivers newspapers to schools at 
discounted rates.

“Our job is to encourage students to 
read, to get in the habit of reading the 
news,” Trieu said. “It’s not only educa-
tional but it’s also fun.”

He said the program only charges 
schools for newspapers that are picked 
up from displays by students. Any 
unused newspapers recovered during 
the next day’s delivery are recycled and 
not charged to the school.

Trieu said that the A.S. Council 
could foot the estimated yearly cost of 
$124,775 itself, or it could split the cost 
with the separate colleges if they chose 
to forgo their individual readership 
programs in favor of a campuswide 
one.

Associate Vice President of Local 
Affairs Aida Kuzucan spoke during Aida Kuzucan spoke during Aida Kuzucan
open forum about her experience with 
the La Jolla Shores Town Council.

“They hate us, not that we didn’t 
know that,” Kuzucan said. “They don’t 
even consider us a part of the La Jolla 
community.” 

The town council’s district line along 
North Torrey Pines means that UCSD is 
considered a “border community.”

She cited the dispute over the pro-
posed new transfer housing and the 
existing gliderport as the cause of cur-
rent tensions between the city council 

and UCSD.
In seeking to 

mend fences with 
the town council, 
Kuzucan said, “Do 
not let the transfer 
housing be built as 
it is. There’s a lot of 
shady stuff going 
on … we should 

not, not, not, not, not let this happen.”
Also, Associate Vice President of 

Academic Affairs Long Pham updat-Long Pham updat-Long Pham
ed the council on the activities of the 
Academic Senate, to which he is the 
only undergraduate representative.

According to Pham, the Academic 
Senate is currently reconsidering the 
class withdrawal policy, in an attempt 
to reduce the number of students who 
receive “W”s in classes. Currently, stu-
dents who log on to TritonLink during 
weeks five through nine of the quarter 
can drop classes but get a “W” for 
withdrawal on their transcripts, but the 
senate is mulling a policy to make this 
process more restrictive.

“Last year [the Academic Senate] 
researched policies at other UC schools,” 
Pham said. 

A subcommittee this year of under-
graduate students, faculty members, 
and “other relevant parties is going to 
see if there’s a problem and, if there is a 
problem, find alternative ways to find a 
solution,” he said.

Pham said recommendations are 
expected by the end of this year.

were redrafted.
Bournoutian said that the yearly 

operating total presented to the com-
mittee last year totaled about $186,000, 
including staff member salaries, pay for 
student interns, supplies and expenses. 

“To put it in perspective, each year 
the committee is able to provide no 
more than $200,000 total in perma-
nent funds — funds that are provided 
every year, as opposed to just one year,” 
he said.

However, he said that budgetary 

constraints were not the only reason 
the program could not be funded, as 
the committee concluded that costs 
associated with the center would be 
better spent enhancing similar leader-
ship-oriented programs.

Although the center was able to 
expand the Passport to Leadership 
program — a series of free workshops 
designed to enhance and maximize 
leadership skills — and make additions 
to other programs, Bournoutian said 
the committee felt the magnitude of 
the new offerings was not enough. 

Nevertheless, the committee 
agreed that some form of leadership 
program should exist, and decided to 
provide about $60,000 to the Center 
for Student Involvement — former-
ly called Student Organizations and 
Leadership Opportunities — to fund 
some former L.E.A.D. programs for 
the new fiscal year. RFAC also pro-
posed moving the Express to Success 
program from Revelle College to the 
student life department, since its objec-

was found on a technician’s glove, 
and the shipment was then repack-
aged and moved to a storage facil-
ity, according to LLNL spokeswoman 
Lynda Seaver.

Seaver said that the technicians 
present were immediately treated 
with Cipro — an antibiotic approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration 
to combat inhaled anthrax — but 
showed no symptoms of anthrax poi-
soning.

“Less than a week later, they were 
back to work,” she said. “There was 
never any danger to the public.”

The scientist who packed the vials 
later resigned from her position.

Several layers of packaging would 
have made it difficult for the sub-
stance to reach the technicians, 
Seaver said, but the laboratory could 
not rule out the possibility that the 
substance on the glove was in fact 
anthrax.

LLNL has been shipping biological 
agents fairly regularly since the 1960s, 
but this is the first occurrence of an 
anthrax leak, Seaver said.

The OIG also alleged that at the time 
of the breach, the scientist who sent the 
vials lacked proper authorization to 
handle the agent. Seaver acknowledged 

the mistake, but said it was a proce-
dural error and not an instance of any 
intentional misconduct.

“The individual had the necessary 
authorization, but it had lapsed and 
had not been renewed,” she said. “It 
was a technicality.”

Seaver said that the fine is a result 
of two separate incidents, the latter 

being a second shipment to Virginia 
— sent by the same scientist — where 
an error in paperwork led to a ship-
ment containing more anthrax than it 
should have.

Although the fine is the largest of 
11 assessed since 2003 for violating 
rules governing such biological agents, 
Seaver said that both parties ultimately 

agreed on the final amount.
“We’re not disputing the fine,” she 

said.
She also said that the laborato-

ry is currently undergoing protocol 
changes to safeguard against future 
breaches.

“We’ve since instituted several pro-
cedures in training to ensure that it 
won’t happen again,” she said. “We 
take our work with biological agents 
very seriously.”

The Centers for Disease Control 
issued LLNL an unrestricted, three-
year renewal of its select agent regis-
tration in April 2006. 

However, representatives from the 
Government Accountability Office — 
the investigative branch of Congress 
— reported last week that the federal 
government has not been adequately 
monitoring biocontainment laborato-
ries such as LLNL, raising questions 
about the safety of such facilities.

The University of California sole-
ly managed LLNL from its inception 
in 1952 until September 2007. The 
lab is currently run by Lawrence 
Livermore National Security, LLC, of 
which the university is a member.

Tuesday was sorority bid day, which means all UCSD’s wannabe celebutantes are out 
in full force — along with every 
styled lock freshly highlighted and 
each tiny, manicured digit a per-
fect glittering pink — sporting their 
brand-new gold-and-magenta print-
ed tanks.

And I’ll just come out and say it: 
I’m judging you sorority lemmings. 
With your unnaturally dazzling 
smiles and your shoe-matches-bar-
rette coordination, you’re so uni-
form it makes me want to scream. 
This is why when my little brother, 
a freshman at Cal State Northridge, 
called me a few days ago to say he 
just rushed a frat, I was stunned. My 
perpetually-proud 
elder-sister heart 
sank.

“Don’t worry,” 
he assured me. 
“This is like, a cool 
frat.” 

A cool frat? 
What the fuck? 
Isn’t that like, a fun 
root canal? 

I wasn’t con-
vinced. However, 
not wanting to 
crush his wide-
eyed first-month-
of-college spirit, I gently asked what 
he meant. He explained that the 
other guys seemed nice, and that 
he wanted to get involved in some-
thing the way he’d joined marching 
band in high school. Then, just as I 
was about to say something snarky 
regarding the difference between 
synchronized marching and binge 
drinking, he added something that 
stopped me in my tracks.

“You know, like the way you’re all 
into the newspaper,” he said. 

Hmm, touché. 
I guess when you put it that way, 

it really isn’t fair at all for me to judge 
the hot-girl brigades. These fashion-
centric crowds, though shallow and 
highly decorated, are similar to any 
other group of friends. 

And maybe I’m just taking out 
my nonconformist aggression on an 
easy target. 

While these type-A sorority and 
fraternity people express themselves 
by being matchy-matchy with their 
40 best friends, I prefer something 

different. I rock the too-big-band-
sweatshirt-and-dirty-Chuck-Taylors 
look because, you know, I’m so origi-
nal and anti-mainstream. 

I read nonfiction books and news-
papers, not gossip magazines. I work 
two jobs and never go to the gym. 
If I could have chosen anywhere for 
vacation last summer it would have 
been Winslow, Ariz., not Cancun. I 
think my dysfunctional family has 
given me depth and a good sense 
of humor, which I use to scoff at 
girls who dream of a white picket 
fence and oven-baked cookies. And 
I wouldn’t be caught dead listening 
to whiney-boys Good Charlotte or 
James Blunt — it’s only Cheap Trick 
and Bob Dylan for me. 

But that’s just a different kind of 
uniform.

My whole fight-the-man think-
for-yourself approach — though 
sincere — is really just another stan-
dardized way of flaunting my values. 
Just like the way emo-indie types 
have their shaggy bangs, tight black 

jeans and Panic! 
at the Disco. Or 
the way artsy 
types have 
their thrift-
store cardigans, 
M o l e s k i n e 
notebooks and 
foreign ciga-
rettes. 

In a way, 
these uber-
trendy soror-
ity people aren’t 
being fake; 
they’re actually 

more honest. They’ve got spirit (yes 
they do!) and they aren’t afraid to 
come out and say it, even if by doing 
so, they become an easy target for 
assholes like me. 

I’ve surrounded myself by people 
with the same beliefs and interests as 
me, and in doing so I’ve convinced 
myself that we’re different — and in 
some way better — than them.

But though the crowd I roll with 
may be quirkier and more left-of-cen-
ter, we’re still just as concerned with 
what’s happening on MTV, even if it’s 
to fuel our mockery of conventional 
America. And what makes that any 
better than those who embrace their 
consumerist nature, parading around 
in Juicy Couture and Greek letters?

Maybe we indie/artsy/original 
types are more bogus than we’d like 
to let on — after all, by deliberately 
setting our styles against the pop-
culture grain in an attempt to be 
avant-garde we’re really just giving 
credit to the very thing we’re trying 
to subvert.

Although it’s true that La Jolla’s Casa Beach — better known as Children’s Pool — may have started out as a place for swimmers, for the past 
decade a colony of harbor seals has used its protected 
waters as a safe haven, attracting thousands of visitors 
every year who want to catch a glimpse of the southern-
most seal rookery in the United States.

But a recent ruling by the 4th District Court of 
Appeals could jeopardize the beach’s status as a home 
for the seals. The court ignored a public opinion poll in 
which eight out of 10 San Diegans supported preserving 
the rookery, then ordered that the beach be dredged 
and the seals removed in order to comply with the site’s 
original designation as a public park and beach exclu-
sively for children.

Proponents of restoring the site to a children’s beach 
have called the decision a long-awaited victory, say-
ing the seals contaminate the water. Conservationists, 
on the other hand, have decried the ruling as a swan 
song for the only mainland seal rookery between Baja 
California and Santa Barbara County.

However, the ruling isn’t just bad news for seal lovers; 
it also affects local residents, as noted by UCSD profes-
sor emeritus and coastal oceanography and sedimenta-
tion specialist Douglas L. Inman, who said the decision 
to dredge the beach would have an undeniable impact 
on the rate of cliff erosion in the surrounding areas.

The San Diego City Council has offered a compro-
mise that’s in the best interests of both conservationists 
and residents: allowing beach access during summer but 
roping off the area from December to May to accommo-

date the seals’ birthing and pupping season. 
With this solution, no dredging is required, spar-

ing both the seals and the local cliffs while also offer-
ing children a safe place to swim during the warmer 
months.

San Diego City Attorney Michael Aguirre said he 
intends to appeal the decision to the California Supreme 
Court — the court must take this compromise into 
consideration. 

Otherwise, it will be a sad and unnecessary ending to 
a treasured chapter of local history.

The long-standing campus goal of establishing transfer housing is heading full-steam for a crash into our neighborhood’s gliderport. And what a shame this 
crash is, provided the campus loses a lot either way the situ-
ation turns. If the Torrey Pines Gliderport is able to block 
construction of UCSD’s 14-story transfer housing, the cam-
pus loses its chance to strengthen a highly underrepresented 
community. But if the lofty 14-story transfer housing struc-
ture is erected, it will draw the ire of many locals.

A student perspective, which should welcome the trans-
fer-student presence the project would support, obscures the 
seemingly irrelevant gliderport. But there are consequences 
to brushing aside the local voices fighting to keep the airways 
intact. As the campus plans expansion, we could later find 
use for the local ties strained by today’s struggle — a com-
promise needs to be reached, and that means a lot of middle 
ground to cover.

To UCSD’s credit, in 2004 officials included housing 
plans in a Long Range Development Plan and offered 
opportunities for the public to comment on projects such as 
transfer housing. There was no protest, then.

Now, the gliderport’s supporters find themselves fight-
ing an uphill battle. The multimillion-dollar project broke 
ground earlier this month, and has a support base upward of 
20,000. (Who on this campus would not love to see transfer 
housing?)

Accommodating the gliderport would be “costly, and 
it would cause delays for no apparent reason,” said UCSD 
Director of Community Planning Milton Phegley.

However important the end-goal is, there is an “appar-
ent reason” for rethinking the venture: While the building 
site could move, the gliders’ favored and safest airway is 
immobile. Moving forward with the project would distance 
the campus as a “member of the community,” said Gary 
Fogel, a director for the Associated Glider Clubs of Southern 
California. 

There were opportunities to nip this conflict in the 
bud: Instead of a full-blown environmental study, like 
officials conducted for University House, UCSD opted 
for a “mitigated negative declaration.” This route might as 
well be “pay-as-you-go” — even if environmental impacts 
are unearthed during the project’s development, the prob-
lems would only be “mitigated.” A half-hearted approach 
to conflict-solving will alienate our surrounding area. 
The campus should have learned from its handling of last 
year’s incident involving Hillcrest Medical Center, where 
officials pushed to shift manpower from Hillcrest Medical 
Center to La Jolla’s Thornton Hospital, only to be thwarted 
by an uproarious public at the 11th hour. The episode 
highlighted the importance of community relations.

Though Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and the campus 
have labored over finalizing a home for transfer stu-
dents, we must all realize the power of acknowledgement; 
acknowledging the community strain this project presents, 
even in the face of a worthy goal, would go far toward 
proving ourselves worthy of La Jolla.

Need for Transfer Housing 
Outweighs Local Concerns

Dear Editor, 
As a current transfer student 

and president of the All-Campus 
Transfer Association at UCSD, I feel 
the need to speak up regarding the 
issue of constructing new dorms 
for transfer students, and how it has 
been met with disapproval  from the 
Torrey Pines Gliderport. 

Many of the students that trans-
fer to UCSD have high expectations 
of what their college experience is 
going to be like. Many of these same 
students are met by disappoint-
ment when they find out that the  
university does not offer them on-
campus housing. I was, and still am, 
one of those students. 

Transfer students are making 
very reasonable requests. They wish 
to have the privilege of affordable 
on-campus housing where their 
neighbors are their peers, classmates 
and friends. There is so much focus 
on how UCSD officials “really don’t 
care” about what the gliderport sup-
porters have to say and hardly any 
on how those very same officials 
seem to care about thousands of 
students.

Although by the time that the 
new dorms are available for transfer 

students I will have graduated and 
moved away from UCSD, I would 
like nothing more than to see trans-
fer students not be disappointed, 
but rather find an opportunity to 
enjoy their college experience to its 
fullest. 

I implore that construction of 
the much-needed dorms not be 
delayed any further, for it is many 
years overdue.

Bill Shows Promise in 
Cutting Costs for Students
 
Dear Editor,

The Oct. 1 article “State Bills 
Fail to Curtail Ballooning Textbook 
Costs” provided an inaccurate 
assessment of the textbook-related 
bills currently under consideration 
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
The collegiate textbook market is 
very complex; as recent federal stud-
ies have shown, changes across the 
entire textbook market are neces-
sary to help lower student spending 
on textbooks. 

Pointing the finger at a single 
segment is good politics, but doesn’t 
accomplish much. 

Assembly Bill 1548, known as 

the College Textbook Transparency 
Act, is a serious bill that would 
require publishers to disclose pric-
es to faculty, list changes between 
editions and show copyright dates.  
Publishers support this kind of 
transparency and are already going 
to great lengths to provide faculty 
members information about their 
materials, including dedicated facul-
ty Web sites that enable instructors  
to make informed decisions about 
what learning materials would work 
best in their classrooms. 

AB 1548 would also improve the 
entire textbook market by setting 
higher textbook transparency stan-
dards for faculty members, insti-
tutions, publishers and bookstores 
alike. 

The bill would require book-
stores to post their retail pricing 
policies, prohibit the selling of free 
sample instructor copies (a practice 
that raises the price of all text-
books), ban potential conflicts of 
interest in choosing course materi-
als and encourage faculty to place 
their orders early. 

In contrast, the College Textbook 
Affordability Act (Senate Bill 832) is 
a politically charged document that 
the Public Interest Research Group 
has had introduced in legislatures 
across the country. 

The bi l l  requires  
publishers to repeatedly provide the 

same information to faculty during 
every interaction, which would be 
a waste of faculty time and drive 
up prices. 

Publishers share the common 
goal of helping students succeed at 
the postsecondary level, and they 
are committed to working with stu-
dents, parents and faculty to make 
this goal a reality.

PRAY
ERS

By Chris Kokiousis
Contributing Writer

Did the Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel 
Tower go soft? Local indie-rock quar-
tet the Prayers originally derived three 
members from the former San Diego 
punk outfit — though only two remain 
— and their new routine drives the ’00 
rock ’n’ roll-revival (led by acts like the 
Strokes and the Libertines) down to 
the beach bar for some synced harmo-
nies and bluesy surf-rock conventions.

San Diego’s mini music scene his-
torically rides a cycle of hills and val-
leys, regenerating every few years. 
According to the Prayers, chatting in 
the Che Cafe backwoods between sets 
last Saturday night, they currently share 
a nook with friend-bands like the Sess, 
the Muslims and Atoms, together push-
ing the city’s musical resurgence. Art 
Fag Recordings, fronted by label taste-
maker Mario Orduno, released their 
4-song debut EP God Save the Prayers 
back in April; star track “Loose Lips” 
layers shimmering rays of guitar over 
a punchy, airtight rhythm section, and 
“Clandestino” pairs a walking bassline 
with the warm and crunchy tube-amp 
class that guitar legends are made of.

The boys played to a respectable 
crowd at the Che, sharing a cozy stage 
with some chummy indie-soft accom-
plices and appeasing an amicable yet 
jaded hipster posse. “I hear some people/

Yet another export from the wooded indie paradise 
of Portland, Ore., Blitzen Trapper are refreshingly 
uninterested in scoring Internet buzz-band points. 
Instead, their latest experiment in fuzz-pop — the 
grating, dawdling Wild Mountain Nation, ironically 
drooled over by Pitchfork and its army of imitators 
— camps out on the most remote water hole in the 
entire desolate state, channeling the eerie folk of the 
land’s eldest ancestors. They’re no doubt fawned over 
for that precious sense of modern authenticity so few 
are able to ground, but they should mostly be loved for 
not giving a damn in the first place. (SW)

“Freaks” 

MCASD / OCT. 11 / 7 P.M. / $5

Tod Browning’s 1932 sideshow masterpiece still draws 
squirms and turn-aways 75 years later. These freaks are the real 
deal, with effect- and makeup-free midgets, feathered women 
and other carnival oddities. Browning’s lesser-known horror fest 
(you’ve probably seen footage of his 1931 “Dracula”) is really a 
facade for a tale of love and deception, as the midget Hans falls 
for trapeze artist Cleopatra, revealing a cesspool of betrayal, 
bigotry and, ultimately, brutality.  (CM)

F or all the torrents of critical and fan-sent praise the Roots have waded through since their straight-outta-Philly arrival at 
the end of the ’80s (trotting in easily after 
socially conscious, alt-hip-hop predeces-

sors like A Tribe Called Quest and De 
La Soul), the studio hasn’t always proven 
their ideal environment. Most of the Roots’ 

seven full-lengths are spent in a somewhat 
self-conscious limbo, fumbling for common 

ground between balls-out avant-garde and 
the beats/rhymes/life boom-bap they emulat-

ed as youngsters. Each album requires a more 
focused listen than your average backpacker is 

usually willing to give — demanding full atten-
tion and a good, hard chew — also telling of the 

stress that goes into their creation. Then there’s the 
fact that perma-member Black Thought (the Roots 
MC who didn’t get booted for dabbling in heroin) 

isn’t the most memorable of wordsmiths, not known 
for turning the trickiest of phrases — even occasion-
ally falling below the curve with simplistic state-of-

the-world commentary like “It’s like a game of 
roulette, the barrel revolving/ They only wanna 

see us occupying a coffin.”
All this would mean certain death for 

any other middle-of-the-road, lineup-
fluctuating posse. But here’s where a 

critic’s babble fades and the Roots 
take the stage. 

Thing is, these guys can 
play. Their standard jewel-

case routine serves only as an industry 
buoy, and a way to keep their live 
setlists fresh. Black Thought’s every last 
forgettable lyric becomes a brilliantly 
timed placeholder, coming to life over 
a rich instrumental backdrop: currently, 
Kamal’s keyboards, F. Knuckles’ exotic 
percussion, Captain Kirk’s retro guitar 
and, most famously, ?uestlove’s helter-skel-
ter drumset assault, taking a natural life of 
its own under its master’s wiggling afro.

There’s a reason the Roots are the go-to 
name-drop for every case defending hip-
hop as musical, unpredictable and other-
wise equal to the rest of the genres: These 
are not mere hip-hoppers but brimming 
sponges, working to recreate every nuance 
of every radio hit and moment of intrigue 
they’ve stumbled across in a lifetime.

With each performance — neon lights 
darting off Black Thought’s aviators, remix 
building upon remix for a James Brown-
like majesty — the Roots draw closer to an 
untouchable cult status not unlike that of the 
Grateful Dead (sans decaying complacency, 
of course), complete with their very own 
set of Deadheads. But unifying stage-
side awe is not just for the tie-dyed 
stoners anymore: These royalty of 
rap-rock manage to appeal to 
practically every ear with even 
the slightest appreciation for 
virtuosity — and a damn 
good beat to boot.

8  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2007

Jens Lekman
■ Night Falls Over Kortedala
SECRETLY CANADIAN

O h, Sweden — famous for the meatball, Volvos, ABBA — and now, Jens Lekman, youthful indie-pop comedian equipped 
with a rare sense of blatant self-deprecation  
coated in globally-informed twee. His new 
Night Falls Over Kortedala follows previous 
forays (one studio album, one compilation disc 
and a slew of EPs) with similar adventures in 
genre-mashing, pulling verbose mullings from 
the everyday and choice bits from his sizeable 
record collection. But unlike in the past, no 
lone single (like “Maple Leaves,” from 2005’s Oh 
You’re So Silent Jens) stands out so starkly as to 
eclipse the rest of the setlist, giving Kortedala a 
newfound albumwide coherence.

Like the most diligent of hip-hop producers, 
Lekman will borrow a soul singer, lay him over 
a looped orchestra with a finger-snapping beat, 
and then tie all of the fragments together with 
a sunny self-made guitar lick. His lyrical shtick 
chugs along in a lightly accented monotone, rife 
with clever one-liners — “I flirted with a girl in 
sign language ’cause she was deaf” — that do 

occasionally shoot themselves in the foot with 
an overdose of sweetener. “So you pick up your 
asthma inhaler/ And put it against your lips/ Oh, 
those lips I’ve loved,” he reminisces on schmaltzy 
lounge-lizard “I’m Leaving You Because I Don’t 
Love You,” which features the whimpers (and 
direct influences) of fellow candy-coated Swede El 
Perro del Mar and embodies both of Kortedala’s 
two simple categories: childish declarations and 
wry, Morrissey-esque anecdotes.

The album closes with “Friday Night at the 
Drive-In Bingo,” a saccharine novelty that doesn’t 
take itself seriously, but might be too campy for 
those not in on the joke. Lekman obviously has 
a gift for collaged songwriting, but Kortedala 
— with too many rough gems, almost mundane 
in their aimless simplicity — ultimately ends up a 
showcase for his unreached potential.

Jens Lekman performs live Nov. 10 at the 
Troubadour in West Hollywood.

The Fiery Furnaces
■ Widow City
THRILL JOCKEY

R ivaled only by the Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne in her ability to send us to that synth-bubbling happy-place that dreams 
are made of, Eleanor Friedberger manages to 
do so, unlike the benevolent and nurturing 
Lips counselor, without so much as a glance 
in our direction. And as younger brother 
Matthew makes split-decision jumps and cuts 
all over their latest, Widow City, with intro-
verted restlessness — toggling from warped 
’70s sample to cacophonic guest drumroll to 
yard-sale organ — it seems that we’ve stumbled 
into someone else’s dream entirely, a bitter and 
self-distracted dream to which we do not hold 
an invitation.

Curious, then, that instead of erupting into 
the glorious adventure its ingredients promise, 
City winds up as one of the Fiery Furnaces’ 
least surprising works to date. The pair gener-
ates an ample supply of same-blooded energy 
— a crackling heat eager to be released — but 
we can never quite feel it, and instead must 

watch it trapped within the album’s untapped 
bonds, always trampled prematurely by a for-
ward-moving, impatient urge to change the

“If there’s anything I’ve had enough of, it’s 
today,” quivers Eleanor in her oft-imitated, sar-
castic sing-song on “Navy Nurse,” Matthew 
constantly reconsidering the back-tempo, test-
ing a fuzzy riff, a poppy keyboard jig, a Magical 
Mystery Tour acid trip — and his sister continu-
ing to tussle with all the petty suburbia-stuffs 
(wall paint, nautical doormats) of a grumpy

Rilo Kiley
■ Under the Blacklight
WARNER BROS.

I f a simple country gal met the disco king for a one-night stand to forever whisk her from her indie coop, the pregnant fallout would 
certainly sound something like bastard love-
child Under the Black Light, rife with danceable 
fun-jams and funky electric guitar — but capable 
of making or breaking a fan’s love for twee-
darlings Rilo Kiley, now hardly recognizable in 
their streamlined, shiny suits. Hitting a few soul-
chords but usually missing the mark completely, 
the four-piece sways between pop emphatic — 
with themes of heartbreak running amok — and 
simpering stupidity: “Money Maker” mouths off 
about the porn industry to a clubified funk beat 
(“Funny thing about money for sex/ You may get 
rich but you die by it”), but isn’t toxic enough to 
offend even the sternest Mormon.

Kiley do best when jazzing down their 
watery country-western with weighty woes, as 
in “Silver Lining,” a beautiful piece of contempt 
that sees Lewis murder her own affection. “I 
never felt so wicked/ As when I willed our love 
to die,” Lewis croons, graceful in love’s betrayal 
of love but never without the fierce power that 
has earned her the title of indie-pop’s pre-

mier sex-kitten. Before the word “sellout” can 
fall from critics’ lips, they’ll likely find them-
selves tapping a toe to this happy-go-lucky sex 
romp, supposedly stemming from singer Jenny 
Lewis’ San Fernando valley origins — a locale 
entrenched in the porn industry. Songs like 
“Smoke Detector” and “15” are laced in sexual 
innuendo, lusty to the point of ridiculousness, 
exploring the word “smoke” as a euphemism for 
fucking and spilling out juicy details of a pedo-
philic Internet relationship.

Lewis’ foray into Madonna’s world — all 
pretty dresses and cheap shocks — goes astray 
in its effluence of insincere bullshit, more eas-
ily available by way of the top 40. Kiley’s only 
saving grace is their barely visible indie back-
ground, reminding the band to add a little 
weird to the new fun-lite formula, but ultimately 
making no more impression on the world than a 
snowman in sunlight.

Rilo Kiley perform live Oct. 12 at Soma in

A jam band for the Blue Note set, this San Diego jazz/funk/spoken-word five-piece is a heady trip.
Drawing from the lyrical enthusiasm of 
Saul Williams and Gil Scott Heron, the 
sensuously funky rhythms of early-’70s 
Earth Wind and Fire and the hypnotic 
melodies of John Coltrane, K23 assem-
bles a composite much less engaging 
than the sum of its influences.

K 2 3 
is Steve 

Craft on drums, 
Matt LaBarber on 

bass, six-foot-eight-inch 
giant Ian Wright on lead guitar, 

Josh Rice on keyboard and organ, 
and self-proclaimed “social pugilist” 
Alfred Howard on vocals. Howard’s 
wannabe hip-hop, spoken-word 
vocals weave their way through 
K23’s soundscape, at times stand-
ing alone, backed by a subtle beat, 
or subsumed by waves of (not-all-
that-) harmonic improvisation. K23’s 
Web site asserts that Howard’s lyr-
ics appeal to “humanities [sic] most 
primal essence,” but one would hope 
that humanity’s fundamental nature 
isn’t trite, poorly reasoned animos-
ity toward white picket fences, rush 
hour and televisions.  

K23 was founded in 2003, and has 
since released three full-length and 
two live albums —Kudra, 14 Days of 
the Universe and Live at Lestats Vol 
I & II (2004). The collective’s latest 
offering, Whisper of a Newborn Ghost, 
strives for a diverse blend, but attempts 
at rock ballads and soul ditties end up 
melting into a smooth jazz puddle.

The group has played a residency 
at the San Diego House of Blues, 
sets at the Belly Up and pretty much 
every tavern, blues bar and mid-size 
club from Seattle to Flagstaff, Ariz., 
so they’ve definitely cut their teeth 
on live audiences. K23’s downtempo 
jams will ease our harried student 
body into the FallFest-ivities. Those 
in high spirits will get the most out of 
the set, as its jazzy indulgences and 
polemic liberal diatribes can be a bit 
heavy for those on the ground.

FALL
FEST

By Chris Mertan
Associate Hiatus Editor

W es Anderson’s films always have a sense of perpetual autumn about them — bittersweet 
almost to a fault. And while his fifth 
feature, “The Darjeeling Limited,” 
exists among India’s visually lush 
landscapes, that creeping sense of 
browning leaves and blustery nights 
seems to ever invade its countryside.

Perhaps this time around, it has 

to do with the voyeurs whose eyes 
we tour through: the three Whitman 
brothers, who find themselves on a 
spiritual journey — both by will and 
by force — stemming from a prover-
bial how-to list of ways to avoid griev-
ing their dead father, who triggers 
surprisingly strong emotion from his 
oddball offspring despite an obvious 
detachment from their upbringing.

So the Whitmans gather aboard the 
titular train, not having spoken since 
the funeral. Eldest brother Francis 
(Owen Wilson), scarred literally and 
figuratively by his own control issues, 
organizes the sojourn; Peter (Adrien 
Brody), the middle child, is only there

“A Dirty Carnival”
Ultrastar Mission Valley

Wednesday, Oct. 17

T he filming is uninspired but the topic is fresh: Asian man falls for black woman. Each have their limited passions: hip-hop for him, cooking for her. Their relationship develops beyond 
a quick coupling in the sack, but regresses into prejudices, both 
publicly instilled and privately maintained. From being hissed out of 
a Japanese restaurant to being openly ridiculed as Mr. Miyagi, both 
characters endure pervasive abuse.

For some, this film will be just another cliched investigation 
into the complexities of interracial relationships. It poses no new 
questions and even fewer answers. But for others, this film barely 
addresses the subtle racism many Asian-American males face in the 
wider society, white or black. The discrepancy between perspectives 
on Asian femininity (exotic, sexual, purchasable) and Asian mascu-
linity (immasculate, asexual, frail) reveal the extent to which Asian-
American male stereotypes permeate our society. (JG)

“Dark Matter”
Ultrastar Mission Valley

HIGHLIGHTST he parallels are eerie: Liu Xang, a student at Mid-Western Valley State University, finds that culture-gap alienation and cutthroat academia are thwarting his dreams, ending in a malicious com-
bustion of violence. And while it is based on a true story, that story 
is not — as some speculate — the Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute and State University tragedy, which occurred a 
year after the film had been completed. While working 
with A-list talents Meryl Streep and Aiden Quinn, rookie 
Director Chen Shi-zheng (known for his direction of 
Chinese opera) refrains from turning Xang’s story into “Taxi Driver”-
goes-to-college by keeping the gunman human, the story honest and 
the audience fascinated by Xang’s descent — rather than the spilled 
blood that follows. (CM)

B yung-du is a career criminal at 29, an ace hitman still able to find time for an ill mother and 
younger siblings. Of course, sudden 
events have a way of shaking things 
up in the cinema, and Byung-du’s life 
is no exception: He’s forced to both 
tackle a corrupt lawyer and serve as 
gangster consultant for his movie-busi-
ness buddy.

South Korean film has really found 
its international stride in the past decade, 
ranging from kick-ass (“Oldboy”) to 
emotional wallop (“Taegukgi”), and 
while “Carnival” is certain not to waste 
any time keeping our assassin from 
gunplay, you can bet Director Ha Yu 
won’t hold back on drama. Already 
hailed as one of the decade’s best, his 
2006 crime flick is a magnetic study of 
the classic gangster in a modern world 
and his complex connections to the 
people around him. (CM)

W ho knew such a great religious film could come from a Marxist, homosexual atheist? Mel Gibson ain’t got shit (excuse my non-sacred Italian) on Pier Paolo Pasolini; his minimalist — and most literal — portrayal of the Greatest Story Ever 
Told doesn’t stray from the text, focusing on Christ’s revolutionary social message, from 
nativity to resurrection. Pasolini never denies the divinity or humanity of the purported 
son of God, and seamlessly substitutes Matera, a town of virtual caves, for the Holy Land, 
giving it a more realistic ruggedness than the plastic-thatched roofs and cardboard stables 
of Hollywood. Though a non-believer himself, Pasolini deals with the life of Christ (whom 
he called “the greatest hero of all time”) without a political soapbox, and gives a firm testa-
ment of faith in — if not the almighty — the hope of the common man. (CM)

N ot nearly as beautiful as Malena, but far more piercing in its social critique of Sicilian society, “I Cento Passi” is an anti-mafia story with a cinematic salute to mafia films. “I Cento Passi” (one hundred steps) is a true to life film of Italian 
leftist hero Giuseppe Impastato, born into a mafia family but resentful of its crimes. 
Struggling against the codes of honor instilled in him — respect thy father, and respect 
thy mafia — Impastato never comes to terms with the conditions of his southern life. 
Instead, he elevates his personal grief into a public war, broadcasting streams of con-
scious derision against the mafia, publicly humiliating il capo and his father. 

In the film, moments of death become part of the Sicilian landscape, and as it gor-
geously and darkly captures the years in which Italian life was engrained with mafia 
crimes. (JG)

F rom the mind of the greatest Italian filmmaker you’ve never heard of — Palermo-born Vittorio De Seta — these 10-minute documentaries range 
in subject from Sicilian fishers and miners to life atop the 
volcanic Eolie Islands (the latter, in the Cannes award-
winning “Isole di Fuoco”). Neglected by American audi-
ences for decades, De Seta’s distinct flare for cinema-
tography, editing and scores steeped in Sicilian folksong 
has finally begun to garner deserved recognition from 
both critics and those who thought Italian film began 
and ended with Fellini and Antonioni. Along with the 
shorts will play “Detour De Seta,” Salvo Cuccia’s docu-
mentary is a chronicle of De Seta’s life, a feature-length 
project praised by none other than premier Italian-
American auteur Martin Scorsese. (CM)



14  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2007

T he savant at Fox Searchlight who decided it would be a novel idea to detach a feature 
film dependent on its correspond-
ing short should be set ablaze. 
Wes Anderson’s 12-minute “Hotel 
Chevalier” is the most critical 
aspect to fully appreciating “The 
Darjeeling Limited,” and it’s been 
foolishly thrown exclusively to 
iTunes. The short boasts the most 
mature writing of the director’s 
career, as “Darjeeling”’s Jack con-
fronts an ex (Natalie Portman) in a 
Parisian hotel two weeks before the 
India expedition.

We first glimpse Jack cloaked in 
yellow, watching the POW thriller 
“Stalag 17” on TV — an appropri-
ate choice, as he then sees his own 
POW status once Portman’s aggres-
sive alpha female enters the room 
in a gray raincoat. What proceeds 
is a survey of sexual dominance 
and submission in a relationship 
where dodgy dialogue masks each 
character’s intentions and desires; 
Jack wants love in order to feel 
like he lives the life he imagines, 
while his ex just wants a good 
fuck. It is brutal, heartbreaking 
and a sure sign of Anderson’s rip-
ening artistry as a writer-director, 
far beyond the adolescent charm 
of “Rushmore,” sending his naive 
Max Fischer into the ever-confus-
ing universe of adulthood. (CM)

ULTRAZONE — The Ultimate Laser Adventure

to escape his impending fatherhood; 
while the youngest, tortured writer 
Jack (Jason Schwartzman), sports a 
Sgt. Pepper’s moustache and tries con-
stantly to construct his own reality via 
iPod and a series of “fictional” short 
stories. As they turn their trip into a 
drug-fueled bender, we realize the trio 
is nothing more than half-cultured 
band of tourists.

Cramped in the rickety train, 
Anderson’s signature dry wit takes 
a backseat to the emotional core of 
“Darjeeling,” as opposed to side-by-
side seating on past go-rounds.  Each 
comedic vignette — Peter buying a 
snake, Jack convincing himself he’s in 
love, Francis losing a shoe — is more 
for dramatic revelation than simple 
laughter. But the real maturation goes 
to seed once the boys have arrived 
in a remote desert village: Anderson 
combines his notorious pans, zooms, 
slow-mos and camera tracks for some 
of the most stirring visuals he’s ever 
recorded. After a stirring riverside 
rescue, the village sequence opens in 
muted contemplation, finally erupt-
ing into an emotional reawakening 
— courtesy of the Kinks — that strips 
each brother off his guard and forces 
them to at last revisit the family’s past. 
And, in Anderson’s most cinemati-
cally compelling sequence to date, the 
three siblings noiselessly reconcile to 
the Rolling Stones’ “Play With Fire,” 
together connecting the universal dots 
between all those who grieve.

Even rabid Wes-ophiles will 
require multiple “Darjeeling” view-
ings for full appreciation of its many 
subtle yet significant touches, par-
ticularly a cameo by Bill Murray 
and a mystery man on the train 
(remember Pagoda?). At first, it’s dif-
ficult to understand the change in 
the Whitman boys, their dialogue 

steering clear of audible affirmation; 
more than ever, Anderson employs 
his dialogue-as-shield technique to a 
degree that may be — much like the 
auteur’s “Rushmore” or “The Royal 
Tenenbaums” — offsetting to first-
timers looking for direct transforma-
tion.

While we’re on it, save yourself the 
trouble of comparing “Darjeeling” to 
Anderson’s previous films altogether. 
Each is a distinct entry into the 38 
year-old’s adult storybook and a nec-
essary stepping stone for one of the 
only novel filmmakers under the hill. 
And if you’re not keen on Anderson’s 
universe, spare us your pontifica-
tion on the director’s “pretentious-
ness” (which often includes such 
overwrought, empty pokes as “hip-
ster” and, the most heinous attack: 
“quirky”). This innovator’s works are 
of their own logic, islands to nor-
malcy, much like Jack on the train: 
cold to some, welcoming to others. If 
you do buy the ticket, be prepared for 
a bumpy ride alongside fellow Lawn 
Wranglers, Rushmore Beekeepers, 
family geniuses and proud cadets of 
the Zissou Society.

tives were similar.
“The end results were to maintain 

all the programs offered by L.E.A.D., 
save a substantial amount of money, 
and consolidate the organizational 
structure of the various involvement, 
leadership, and development offer-
ings at UCSD to be more logical and 
less confusing to the average student,” 
Bournoutian said. “There were many 
questions as to what the differences 
were between these programs.”

Although the L.E.A.D. Center 

no longer exists, many of its former 
programs have been adopted by CSI.  
Director Emily Marx said since her 
office has absorbed some of L.E.A.D’s 
programs — including Passport to 
Leadership, which was a part of CSI 
before L.E.A.D. was created — it has 
also received funding for one addi-
tional full-time position.

Although some funds are being 
freed up by no longer supporting 
L.E.A.D, the program was not in the 
RFAC’s permanent budget to begin 
with, which minimizes the financial 

impact of cutting the center’s funding.
“Removing it did not give us our 

money back, but left our funding pool 
at the same level,” Bournoutian said. 
“By reorganizing L.E.A.D.’s programs 
back into CSI, we were able to keep 
almost all the benefits of L.E.A.D., but 
have the money necessary to fund all 
these other worthwhile programs, such 
as Psychological Services and Student 
Legal Services.”

rest and has no replacement if some-
thing should happen to her.

“Yeah, it’s kind of extra pressure 
on me,” McGovern said. “I actually 
did jam my finger in the second week 
of tryouts. It hurts still if there is a 
real hard ball shot at me, but I played 
through the pain with a splint and 
took one for the team. It’s a running 
joke on the team that I don’t have a 
backup.”

The Tritons only had a few pre-
cious days of rest before they squared 
off on Oct. 10 against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, back home at the 
Triton Soccer Stadium.

Unfortunately for the Tritons, the 
No. 25 Toros punched in a last min-
ute goal to send UCSD home with its 
first league loss. Further information 
was not available as of press time.

Following the Tritons’ test against 
the Toros, UCSD will trek to Cal 
State Los Angeles to play the Golden 
Eagles, who have gone 2-0-1 and 
have allowed no goals since falling to 
UCSD on Sept. 23. UCSD will hope to 
regain its composure after the disap-
pointing loss to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, and the squad will undoubtedly 
be hoping to make a statement as it 
gears up for the postseason.

ter offense,” he said. “It was good to 
get the goal and to be honest, we had 
some other great chances to tie it.”

When asked if the team would 
continue with the same pattern in its 
upcoming games, Holohan was reluc-
tant to answer certainly.

“We probably will but I can’t say,” 
he said. “I don’t want to give anything 
away. Let’s put it this way, what we did 
against Sonoma, we changed it a bit. 
It looked like we got good stuff up in 
the front and we might continue in 
that way.”

With six games left, the Tritons 
have their backs against the wall if 
they want to extend their season into 
the playoffs. The team has already 
faced three of its next opponents: 

Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State 
Los Angeles and Cal Poly Pomona. 
With the exception of the game 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
the Tritons lost the other two games 
by only one goal.

The Tritons will have a chance to 
redeem themselves but may have to 
do so without Caplan, whose return 
date is unknown.

Holohan acknowledged that the 
team is in for a rough fight but is 
optimistic about the team’s chances of 
a playoff berth.

“It’s always going to be difficult 
to get points, but we have six games 
against conference opponents,” he 
said. “It’s getting to the stage where 
we need points, but it’s not over ‘til 
it’s over.”

UCSD’s cross country team took 
center stage over the weekend at the 
6-kilometer Triton Classic on Oct. 
6. The annual competition yielded 
mixed results: The women’s team fin-
ished in fifth place out of 10 teams 
and the men came in second out of 
the eight competing schools.  

In the men’s race, junior Daniel 
Anderson led the way as the Triton’s 
top performer, finishing in seventh 
place with a time of 33 minutes, 
50.5 seconds. Junior Kevin Klein 
and sophomore Jesse Morill also ran 
solid races, coming in 10th and 13th 
place, respectively. Klein finished his 
race with a time of 33:58.5, while 
Morill was clocked in at 34:06.1. 
Junior Timur Crone and sopho-
more Mike Wright were the next 
two UCSD runners to cross the line, 
with Crone placing 25th and Wright 
finishing 26th. Crone completed the 
race with a time of 34:45.4, with 
Wright coming right behind him at 
34:46.8. 

UCLA’s Henry Hagenbuch won 
the men’s 6-kilometer race with a 
time of 32:43.1. Hagenbuch’s terrific 
race anchored a great Triton Classic 
for the Bruins, who dominated with 
five runners in the top six. The strong 
performance helped UCLA win the 
overall title with 19 points, a mark 
that easily cleared UCSD’s second 
place total of 74 points.

The UCSD women’s cross country 
team was led by senior captain Emily 
McGregor, who finished the race in 
eighth place with a time of 22:53.2. 
Fellow senior Diane Dunn was the 
next Triton to finish, coming in 15th 

out of 119 runners and clocking in 
at 23:17.6. The next three finishers 
from UCSD were junior Ashleigh 
Montgomery (25th, 23:51.7), sopho-
more Jordana Henderson (32nd, 
24:09.6), and junior Dana Underwood 
(35th, 24:16.9).

Zsofia Erdelyi of University of 
Southern California won the race, 
setting a new course record with a 
time of 21:50.4. Cal State Los Angeles 
was the best women’s team of the day, 
recording a total of 34 points. The 
Golden Eagles had runners finish 
second, third, seventh, eighth and 
14th, which helped the school clear 
second-place University of Southern 
California by 36 points.

UCSD cross country has a new 
boss in town, with Nate Garcia set to 
finish up his first year as the team’s 
head coach. Garcia isn’t short on 
credentials, though, having spent the 
last 10 years working beside recent-
ly retired coach Ted Van Arsdale. 
The UCSD alum has no shortage of 
enthusiasm as the team’s leader. 

“I am excited and honored to be 
named the head coach at my alma 
mater,” Garcia said after being hired 
on July 31. “I am looking forward 
to continuing the great tradition of 
excellence [Van Arsdale] helped to 
establish here at UC San Diego.”

The cross country team is on hiatus 
this week, but must prepare for the 

most important part of its schedule in 
the coming weeks. The 2007 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championships are set to take place 
on Oct. 20 and will be hosted by Cal 
State Stanislaus in Turlock, Calif. The 
Triton men will try to improve on 
their third-place finish from a year ago 
in an attempt to dethrone Chico State, 
winner of the last five CCAA Men’s 
Cross Country Championships. The 
conference championship will set the 
stage for the NCAA West Regional on 
Nov. 3, followed by the national cham-
pionships two weeks later. UCSD must 
finish in the top three of the CCAA 
championships in order to advance to 
the West Regional.

Early Goals 
Keep Men’s 
Soccer From 

Big Upset

By Joo Yoon
Staff Writer

Having been shut out in its past 
two games, the UCSD men’s soccer 
team finally broke out of its shoot-
ing slump but still fell short in a 
1-2 loss against No. 21 Sonoma State 
on Oct. 7. The loss dropped the 
Tritons’ overall record to 2-8-2, 1-
5-2 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play, and put a damper 
on the team’s postseason hopes. 

The Tritons lost junior captain 
Tom Caplan to a separated shoulder 
after he was tackled early in the 
match. Play continued as the referee 
did not blow his whistle to allow 
Caplan to receive treatment. The inci-

dent essen-
tially forced 
the Tritons to 
scramble with 
10 healthy 
players on 
the field. The 

onfield injury opened up the Tritons’ 
defense, which gave up a goal just 
four minutes into the game. 

Interim head coach Paul Holohan 
questioned whether Sonoma State 
knew of Caplan’s injury.

“I don’t know what they realized 
but he was on the ground in obvious 
pain,” Holohan said. “I don’t know 
what they did know or what they 
didn’t know.”

Senior captain Josh Levy was  
very frustrated about the incident.

“[Caplan] landed on his shoulder 
and it popped out,” Levy said. “The 
[referee] didn’t stop the play and we 
were all trying to stop it and they 
went to the goal and scored.”

In the second half, the Tritons 
gave up another goal within the 
first two minutes to fall behind 0-
2. However, sophomore midfielder 
Tony Choi scored his first goal of 
the season to help the Tritons claw 
back to 1-2. That was as close as the 
team got to a victory as it only man-
aged to get off two more shots for 
the rest of the half. 

Levy believed that the two goals 
allowed were not hard-earned, with 
the first coming while Caplan was 
down and the second coming from 
close range when the Triton defense 
inexplicably collapsed. 

“The second goal was just anoth-
er little error,” he said. “One guy 
wasn’t marking his man and the guy 
was wide open and took a shot and 
scored.”

Despite the loss, Holohan was 
very proud of the way the team 
played against one of the best teams 
in the region.

“We played excellent,” Holohan 
said. “We put in a great effort 
against probably the best team in 
the region. I believe a tie would have 
been a fair result.” 

According to Holohan, the 
Tritons finally scored their first goal 
in the past three games by altering 
their offensive game plan by using 
Choi differently.

“We played a little bit different 
with Tony and we had a much bet-

The Tritons finished their road 
trip the exact same way they started 
it: with an impressive shutout vic-
tory. On the afternoon of Oct. 7, the 
UCSD women’s soccer team faced 
off against conference foe Sonoma 
State, prevailing with a 1-0 victory. 
The win upped UCSD’s record to 
10-0-1 (7-0-1 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association) with six games 
remaining before postseason play. 
Prior to the Tritons’ match head 
coach, Brian McManus stressed how 
crucial victory was for the team.

“Every conference game is impor-
tant,” McManus said. “For where 
Sonoma’s season is right now, it will 
make this game all the more impor-
tant. Their season is really on the 
line against us.”

The Seawolves proved no match 
for the unbeaten Tritons, whose skill 
as the conference powerhouse sunk 
Sonoma’s conference record to 2-
6-1.

UCSD’s knack for scoring early is 
what helped it dominate the rest of 
the game with a resilient defense. 

Senior midfielder Chelsey 
Campbell followed the Tritons’ early 
scoring trend, netting the game’s 
lone goal in the 28th minute.

Campbell was relieved to notch  
her first goal of the season — the 
ninth of her UCSD career — and 
was happy that her strike made the 
difference in the match.

“It was good to get past that first 
hump,” Campbell said. “It came at 
the right time as the first goal of the 
game.”

The Triton defense made sure that 
Campbell’s goal would be more than 
enough to ensure victory, shutting 
down any chance of a Seawolf come-
back. Junior keeper Jessica McGovern 
recorded her ninth shutout of the 
year while lowering her goals-against 
average to 0.36. This latest shutout 
was easy compared to others this sea-
son, with McGovern needing to make 
only two saves throughout the game. 
McGovern was quick to deflect any 
personal praise for UCSD’s defensive 
prowess and 
spread it to 
the defense as 
a whole.

“Last year 
I had a really 
low goals-
against average, too,” McGovern 
said. “The difference in that this 
year I’m only having to save three or 
four goals a game. Our defense this 
year is a lot better.”

With the onslaught of injuries 
that have confronted the Tritons 
recently, no position is as vulnerable 
as McGovern’s. She has played every 
minute of every game this season 
without a true keeper waiting in 
the wings as backup. McGovern is 
all too aware of the pivotal role she 
plays, knowing that she is allowed no WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN

Although Sonoma State kept junior forward Natasha Belak-Berger close on Oct. 7, her offensive 
production has been outstanding as she’s led the team with six goals and four assists in 11 games.
