Dec. 17 — When it was first released in 1982, “Tron” was the pinnacle of computer-
generated effects, mostly because it was one of the first films ever to have them. Since then, 
last year’s “Avatar” — blue people and all — has been crowned king of CGI. It’s only fitting 
that “Tron’s” sequel, “Tron: Legacy,” will hit theaters now and attempt to reclaim its throne 
from “Avatar” in the ranks of over-the-top visual epics. 

So how exactly does “Tron” plan to beat the highest grossing film of all time? Five

A.S. Council appointed three freshman senators at yes-
terday’s night’s meeting and is also in the process of select-
ing two transfer senator, making this the �rst year with an 
extra transfer senators in o�ce. 

Warren College freshman Jeremy Akiyama, Roosevelt 
College freshman Baldeep Dhaliwal and Muir College 
freshman Leah Wong were selected to be the new senators, 
e�ective Winter Quarter 2011.

“I’m just thankful that I will be one of three people rep-
resenting the voices of the constituents that have not been 
represented in A.S. in the past 10 weeks,” Akiyama said. 

Akiyama said he is optimistic about his goals for next year. 
“It will be challenging since our appointments came at 

the end of our �rst quarter at UCSD,” Akiyama said. “But 
I’m optimistic that the freshman council can gain momen-
tum in January.”

On Tuesday evening, A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
and a selection committee interviewed 10 out of the 33 ap-
plicants, who were scored by committee members based 
on what they felt best �ts what council wanted in a fresh-
man senator, according to Press Secretary Reem Ateyeh.

“We had a signi�cantly higher number of applicants 
this year,” Ben Hassine said. “�is is not traditionally ex-
pected, but it is much due to our big push at the beginning 
of the year due to increased publicity.”

�e senator rates in the past followed a 3:1 ratio of three 
freshman senators to one transfer senator — a re�ection 
on the actual student population. 

“Since then, that ratio has increased to more of a 3:2 
di�erence,” current Transfer Senator Adam Powers said. 
“Another transfer senator was necessary to claim accurate 
and e�ective representation of the vital transfer student 
population.”

Interviews for the two transfer senator positions and 
one advocate general position will be on Dec. 2 and 3, 
respectively.

Academic Senate — a group of 
approximately 150 UCSD students, 
faculty and sta� members — held its 
second meeting of the year on Nov. 30 
to discuss a proposed diversity course 
requirement for new students, as well 
as the development of a new writing 
center and responses to the state budget 
crisis.

�e Senate discussed a diversity 
course as a possible general course 
requirement for entering freshmen. 
According to Havis, the need for such 
a class was highlighted “in the wake 
of the unrest last year,” when racially 
controversial incidents o�ended mi-
nority students on campus and led to 
increased funding for groups like the 
Student A�rmative Action Commit-
tee.

�e Academic Senate formed a spe-
cial committee made up of students, 
faculty, and provosts from the six col-
leges  to discuss the standards for the 
diversity class — which were part of the 
demands made by the Black Student 
Union — that would raise awareness 
among incoming students about issues 
of race, gender and sexuality.

�e Senate also reviewed Academic 
Council recommendations for increas-
ing revenue. Among the recommenda-
tions were faculty and sta� downsizing, 
a moratorium for capital building proj-
ects and a limit on the creation of new 
academic programs.  

Although the recent 8-percent tu-
ition increase was mentioned and its 
rami�cations discussed, no actions to 
decrease its e�ect on students were �-
nalized.

“�e Senate may comment on fees 
but the Regents set them,” Academic 
Senate Chair Frank L. Powell said. “De-
cisions about new academic programs, 
[as well as] the size of faculty and sta�, 
will likely be considered as part of the 
Senate’s on-going work to deal with 
budget cuts.”

�ough the Senate advises UC Re-
gents on budget issues, the Regents 
make the �nal decisions on budget 
policies.

During the meeting’s discussion on 
budget cuts, some spoke out against the

SPREADING 
THE WORD

By Regina Ip
News Editor

Today is the last day for members of 
United Auto Workers 2865 — a union 
representing more than 12,000 academic 
senate employees at University of California 
campuses — to vote on the controversial 
agreement made between union negotiators 
and the UC system.

On Nov. 21, a group of 
union members, unsatisfied 
with the agreement terms, 
organized a campaign urging 
members to vote against 
the tentative labor contract 
reached on Nov. 17 after five 

months of negotiation.
“The bargaining committee did not 

work hard enough to secure a better deal,” 
UAW member and UCSD Communications 
graduate student John Armenta said. “They 
were given plenty of opportunities and the 
current agreement is insufficient.”

Members of the “Vote No” campaign 
argued that one major part of the new 
contracts — the proposed 2-percent annual 

salary increase with the possibility of 
increases in the next two academic years — 
does not match the projected three-percent 
inflation rate.

“We’re glad there’s a meager pay raise, but 
it’s under the inflation rate,” Armenta said. 
“On paper, it looks like a pay raise but it’s 
actually a cut… Inflation’s 3 percent and we 
only get a 2-percent raise, so that’s actually a 
1-percent decrease in standard of living.”

In addition, the campaign asks for a full 
fee remission that reimburses employees for 
their student fees, instead of a partial one for 
non-resident tuition. 

But others, including some union 
negotiators, said that the agreement would 
vastly increase worker benefits. Under 
the proposed contract, the total childcare 
reimbursement amount would increase from 
$900 to $2,400 per year. 

It also includes increasing the union’s 
role in negotiating health care benefits, 
maintaining compensation for union 
bargaining team members and improving 
timeliness of job offer notifications.

NationalÊGeographicÊTeamÊContinuesÊMongoliaÊExpedition
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Laira Martin
Contributing Writer

The warlord infamous for unit-
ing Mongolia and forging the largest 
empire in history has, for the last 800 
years, laid buried in a hidden tomb. 
But if UCSD scientist Dr. Albert Lin 
has his way, Genghis Khan’s last rest-
ing place won’t be so secretive for 
much longer. 

A research team from UCSD, 
headed by Lin, combined forces with 
National Geographic to work on a 
non-invasive archaeological search 
for Khan’s tomb near his birthplace in 
Khentii Aimag, in Mongolia’s Valley 
of the Khans.

Lin and his team, based in UCSD’s 
Center for Interdisciplinary Science 
in Art, Architecture and Archeology, 
began the project over a year ago. 
Little is known about Khan’s burial 
compared to the importance of his 
contributions to the world, including 
modern military strategies, recurve 
bows and stirrups (the height of war-
fare technology at the time), and 
bringing the East and West together. 
Faced with this lack of information, 
Lin and his team are using technol-
ogy to bring them closer to finding 

the tomb.
“Genghis Khan had a huge 

impact, which we know of today,” Lin 
said. “Technology, international rela-
tions and even our very own genetics 
— one in 200 men today are known 
to be genetically related to Genghis 
Khan.”

Finding the tomb proved difficult 
since it was hidden without any sort 
of markings, following the customs 
of Khan’s tribe. The UCSD team is 
using state-of-the-art technology and 
techniques like GOI satellite imaging, 
3-D virtual reality, ground penetrat-
ing radar and aerial mapping to cata-
lyze their search.

“We are using physical tools that 
allow us to measure magnetic shifts 
in the ground that are either induced 
or observed passively, [allowing] 
us to map what is underneath the 
ground without having to dig any-
thing up,” Lin said.

The use of noninvasive archaeo-
logical tools is a fairly recent practice 
that allows for progress without dam-
age to the historical sites.

“This is an important site for the 
Mongolian people,” Lin said. “We do 
not want to destroy or disturb it. We 
just want to find information to be 

able to protect it.” 
In addition to finding Genghis 

Khan’s tomb, Lin and his colleagues 
hope to also document the heritage 
of the Mongolian people.     

 “We are hoping to use the infor-
mation we discover from these expe-
ditions to provide the Mongolian 
people and their government with 
tools so they can make decisions 
about conservation,” Lin said.

UCSD and National Geographic 
are working together to increase the 
chances of finding the tomb. 

Calit2, which offers the program, 
has a HIPerSpace display wall, which 
is a one-gigapixel display that allows 
Lin’s team to examine single pixels 
of digital images of the Mongolian 
territory. There are 70 display tiles, 
each with a four-megapixel resolution 
— adding up to a total of 286 mil-
lion pixels — allowing Lin and other 
UCSD researchers to examine photos 
with great detail. This technology 
allows Lin and his team to avoid dis-
turbing the land during their search, 
while also allowing them to work 
from San Diego part time.

National Geographic also 
uses the help of “online explor-
ers.” By logging on to the National 

Geographic web site, anyone can 
tag modern and ancient structures 
in a GOI satellite image of the 
Valley of the Khans, which might 
be clues to finding Genghis Khan’s 
tomb. Lin and his team will then 
explore the sights tagged by online 
explorers in Mongolia.

“We have received really good 
feedback from the public that has 
guided us towards some really 
incredible discoveries of cultural her-
itage sites that even predate Genghis 
Khan,” Lin said.

The arrival of Week 10 brought with it the last A.S. Council meeting of 2010, and my 
last council meeting until further 
notice.  Public input included a request 
from members of 
Students for Civil 
Rights in Iran for 
council to pass the 
resolution call-
ing for the release 
of student activ-
ists being held 
in Iran. The DJs 
and Vinylphiles Club requested fund-
ing for a Winter Quartet event titled 
“Something Awesome.”  

The initial budget presented to 
council was revised to total to $12, 
458. The increase in costs, according 
to head events planner Chris Perry 
and president Jordan Clarno, is due to 
higher security costs and police pres-
ence.  Since the event will take place in 
PC Plaza, Clarno said that it would be 
more expensive to staff security profes-
sionals in an outside venue.   

AVP of Student Organizations  
Carli Thomas mentioned that the 
event last year totaled to nearly half 
the cost that DVC is asking for this 
year, though Clarno mentioned that 
estimated attendance, which went up 
from 900 to 1400 people. The bud-
get for “Something Awesome” was 
eventually modified to $10,493, and 
approved despite three objections from 
A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine, 
VP External Affairs Michael Lam 
and newly appointed Social Sciences 
Senator Rena Zoabi.  

Special Presentation time brought 
a talk from the Director of Academic 
Computing Services Jeff Henry as 
well as the Instructional Technology 
Vision & Funding Committee.   The 
Committee discussed the issue of insti-
tuting a $5-per-unit technology fee to 
meet the rising costs of keeping campus 

up-to-date with technological features 
in classrooms.  These services include 
podcasts, computer labs, and websites 
such as WebCT. 

AVP of College Affairs  Leonard 
Bobbitt expressed 
concern over con-
necting the fee 
with the num-
ber of units that 
a student takes, 
therefore creat-
ing an imbal-
ance between the 

amount full time students pay with the 
amount part-time students would pay 
for services they may take advantage of. 

AVP of Enterprise Operations Brian 
McEuen gave a presentation about 
the up-and-coming Triton Outfitters, 
the newest A.S. enterprise.   Triton 
Outfitters will be starting up as mobile 
store instead of having a location in 
Price Center, saving $80,800. This 
mobile store would be placed through 
tents at the farmers markets, Sun God 
Festival and the vendor fairs that take 
place every quarter.   McEuen hopes 
this approach will build a solid custom-
er based and allow for expansion in the 
future. The enterprise hopes to expand 
to Price Center within five years.  The 
A.S. piggy bank just got really happy.

Council returned to the resolution 
calling for human rights and freedom 
in education in Iran. With numer-
ous other amendments proposed and 
passed, the resolution no longer had 
any contentious issues. The resolution 
failed.  Campuswide Senator Michael 
Raimondi expressed disappointment 
that council tried to end the discussion 
early during the special presentation 
about the fee increase for technology 
on campus. 

So with that meeting, I bid A.S. 
Council farewell. Our love/hate affair 
is over for now.  But do not fret, I will 
be around. Watching. Waiting. Hoping.

“The economic package provided 
to academic student employees, 
particularly the 2-percent annual 
increases with a chance to receive 
more, is extremely favorable in light 
of the state’s fiscal crisis,” UCOP 
spokesperson Steve Montiel said.

A majority vote is required to pass 
the tentative agreement. Currently, 
946 members have pledged to vote 
no on the contract on the campaign 
website, www.ucstudents.org/voteno. 
According to UAW Northern Vice 
President Daraka Larimore-Hall, 
votes will be counted in the union 
office at UCLA.

“It’s a democratic process and 
people have their right to campaign,” 
Larimore-Hall said. “We’ll see when 
the votes are coming.”

If the union approves the contract, 
the terms will take effect from the day 
of ratification until Sept. 30, 2013.

UC Santa Cruz UAW unit chair 
Brian Malone, one of the members 
who signed an open letter endorsing 
a “no” vote, said members have been 
receptive to the “Voting No” campaign. 

 “We’re having a really good 
response from our membership,” 
Malone said. “We have a good turnout. 
We think that a certainly large majority 
of people on our campus [at UCSC 
are] voting here.”

Malone said he believes that, due 
to the campaign’s efforts, there is a 
chance that the tentative agreement 
will not be ratified.

“[It’s] definitely a possibility at 
this point,” he said. “I wouldn’t be 
surprised.”

But Malone expressed worry about 
the security of the voting process.

“One concern we’re having right 
now is actually around the security of 
this election,” Malone said. “We think 
the UAW leadership is making steps 
in the last few days to actually make 
the possibility of election fraud much 
more likely.”

According to Malone, the UAW 
election committee chair is refusing 
to share the tally of votes from each 
campus. Union members against 
approving the agreement are asking 
for those votes.

“We’re demanding those votes as a 

deterrent,” Malone said. “There needs 
to be a check [for] whether or not 
those people who voted actually voted. 
Otherwise, the way it’s being run right 
now — if we don’t have public access 
— they can just check off a million 
names. I’m not saying it’s happening, 
necessarily, but the election committee 
needs to actually make this a fair, 
transparent process.”

If the agreement is not approved, 
UAW and the UC negotiators will 
renegotiate their terms.

“What’s wrong with just going 
back to the table and trying to get 
something better?” Armenta said.

Montiel said renegotiations would 
not necessarily lead to more benefits. 

“UC negotiators enhanced 
a previous offer, contingent on 
agreement by the UAW,” Montiel said. 
“If the contract is not ratified, it is true 
that negotiations will resume. But, if 
that happens, the university would 
consider all alternatives, including a 
return to the previous offer.”

tuition increases, arguing that the state was not funding UC 
enough because the students would cover the costs.

“[Some in the legislature look to] balance the budget on 
the backs of students, seeing them as a resource for revenue,” 
Pathology Professor Henry Powell said.

UC students are bearing a brunt of the �nancial burden 
caused by California’s recession, Powell said. He also argued 
that policy makers see professors that advocate for higher 
education funding as a special interest group, while student 
advocates are seen as a group that makes a valuable contribu-
tion to the ongoing discussion.

Also discussed were workload issues for the well-being fac-
ulty and student. Vice Chancellor of Student A�airs Penny Rue 
talked about responding to “students of concern”, or troubled 
students, and gave a red folder to sta� and faculty to let them 
know how to deal with students in cases of emergency.

“Students of concern are those who have a GPA prob-

lem, problems with attendance, display erratic behavior and 
whose friends are worried about them,” Marshall College 
Provost Allan Havis said. “�e administration wants to take 
a proactive stance towards these students of concern in the 
future.”

For the Founders’ Day event on Nov. 18., Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox said she was proud that the students pro-
tested against fee increases in a silent, professional manner as 
to not disturb other students, faculty and sta� that attended 
the event.

Academic Senate also discussed the possibility of opening 
a writing center to improve the colleges’ writing standard, in 
addition to helping with exams and graduate school applica-
tions through one-on-one tutoring.

�e next Academic Senate meeting will be on Jan. 25, 
2011.

Only one week of hell left. If we make it through finals, we’ll be kicking it with the 
fam, comparing stories with home-
town friends and, thank god, eating 
food that comes from neither Plaza’s 
hallowed halls nor the frozen food 
aisle of Ralph’s. With the holidays fast 
approaching, it won’t be long until 
you stumble home from your last 
final with the realization that you have 
three hours to pack your worldly pos-
sessions for the great migration home. 

As excited as you might be to eat 
your mom’s roasted chicken again, 
when you’re surrounded by months 
of dirty clothes, early-purchased 
Christmas presents, one suitcase and 
no desire to shell out $50 to check an 
extra bag, it may feel like it’s time to 
panic. Luckily, How-to Guru is here to 
teach you how to pack.

The most important thing to 
remember is to roll your clothes — or 
at least the ones that can stand a wrin-
kle here and there. Rolling squishes 
out air pockets so your clothes take 
up less space. You can roll underwear 
and socks and shove them into shoes 
to save even more space. If your shoes 
are victim to disgusting foot secrets, 
shove dirty clothes in instead — 
there’s no harm in adding a little extra 
funk to clothes that are already dirty, 
right?  

Unless you like the thought of 
your favorite body lotion violating 
your clothes mid-flight, throw all 
your toiletries in a sealed plastic bag. 
Better yet, leave them behind — mom 
and dad have toothpaste to spare, and 
unless your little siblings have gone 
unwashed in your absence, there will 
be enough spare shampoo and lotion 
to make toiletries a low-priority item.

The entire closet of shoes doesn’t 
need to come either. If you’re pressed 
for space, stick to the basics: Flip flops 
(a given), a pair of sneakers and dress 
shoes (for Grandma’s sake). Though it 
might be a hassle when you reach the 
body scanners, pack your flip flops 
and don your sneakers. The space you 
save by not checking your bags is well 
worth having to untie your shoes in 
front of security. In fact, wear all of 
your heaviest clothes to the airport — 
your biggest coat, your thickest jeans, 
your clunkiest shoes. You might look 
like a fool — or a terrorist — but your 
suitcase will thank you.

Now, the real packing begins. 
Shoes go in on the very bottom, cov-
ered by stacked clothing rolls (jeans 
and jackets first!), but save the flip 
flops until the very end, when you’re 
wedging things along the side of the 
suitcase. Make sure breakable items 
are wrapped in your thickest sweater 
and placed in the middle, where 
they’re shielded from the shock of 
your frantic run up an escalator. 

Let’s say you’ve followed all of 
these tips and, short of stealing 
Hermione’s purse from Harry Potter 
7, there is just no way to cram in Dad’s 
UCSD snow globe. Have hope! You’re 
also allowed a backpack or a purse — 
transfer your copy of Les Miserables, 
along with the most  expensive elec-
tronics (laptops, iPods, hard drives 
and the like). Anything worth more 
than a paycheck should be closest to 
you at all times. The last is a lesson is 
one this Guru had to learn the hard 
way — don’t forget your pajamas.

WhenÊThereÕsÊNowhereÊtoÊFall

Students are drowning in tuition increases. Faculty are swamped in furloughs. Our workers are, for the first time in two decades, giving up chunks of 
their paychecks to cover their pension funds.

Whether it’s down to a negligent legislature, care-
less investments or the general fallout from a national 
recession, the UC Office of the President does seem to 
be screwing a lot of people over lately — and for the 
past year and a half, our mantra has been “fight, fight, 
fight.” Now our system administrators are sitting at the 
table with a group of people that might actually be able 
to bend Yudof to their will, and it’s only fair that we 
extend the same rallying cry to their stunt — especially 
since they can only go up from here.

On Nov. 17, after five months of negotiations, the 
United Auto Workers Local 2865 — the group that 
represents the UC system’s graduate student instruc-
tors — finalized the terms of a tentative three-year con-
tract. Voting on whether to accept the contract began 
Monday, ends tomorrow and, if approved, the terms 
will go into effect next quarter.

In its current state, the contract increases salaries by 
2 percent, with potential for future pay raises if the state 
restores UC funding to 2007 levels — an increase that, 
on paper, is more than anyone else has gotten from the 
UCOP lately. It also raises the childhood reimburse-
ment maximum — the amount of money parents get 
to finance putting their kids in daycare — from $900 to 
$2,400 annually, including the summer terms.

To more than 900 graduate student instructors who 
signed a petition encouraging their 12,000 fellow TAs 

to vote no on the contract, it’s just not enough. Union 
members like UC Santa Cruz graduate student Brian 
Malone criticized union leadership for ineffective bar-
gaining, and argued that, especially since requested 
provisions such as smaller class sizes and earlier job 
notifications were not met, union members shouldn’t 
settle for three years of subpar conditions when they 
could have had more.

Graduate student instructors are an integral aspect 
of higher education, providing extra help for students 
and oftentimes taking the role of professors in the class-
room. They are crucial to the quality of our schools 
— when those graduate instructors are overworked 
and underpaid, it hurts the entire institution.  Though 
the university doesn’t have the resources to hand over a 
blank check — and shouldn’t, even if it did — it doesn’t 
hurt to ask for the bare minimum.

But this pay raise doesn’t even cover the 3-per-
cent inflation rate that increased the cost of living 
this year. And, though the University of California 
claims to be the world’s best public school system, 
UC student workers are still paid $1,000 less per 
month than instructors at other public institutions. 
The childcare maximum is an improvement, but 
most instructors estimate the monthly cost of day-
care to be closer to $1000. 

And the potential for a raise is unlikely since 
state funding would need to be restored by roughly 
$270 million to the 2007-08 level. While the latest 

While graduate students are divided on whether to ratify a new UC contract, when 
you’ve got nothing to lose, there’s no harm in asking for more.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
The reproductive rights move-

ment is one of the most convoluted, 
controversial and current efforts of 
advocates for gender equality in the 
U.S. Though abortion has long been 
the hot-button topic, the reproductive 
campaign encompasses myriad issues, 
viewpoints and intricacies. One such 
important issue that rarely captures the 
spotlight concerns egg donation. For 
many reproductive rights proponents, 
the problem with egg donation arises 
not from the physical act of donation, 
but rather from the reimbursement 
for the eggs. The contention is that the 
young women who constitute the vast 
majority of the egg-donating popula-
tion could be coerced into the proce-
dure. This means the subjects might be 
compelled to disregard personal ethi-
cal stances or the possibility of compli-
cations because of financial needs; this 
is known as “undue inducement.”

In response, the American Society 
for Reproductive Medicine, has set 
guidelines for what constitutes appro-
priate compensation for the “time, 
inconvenience and discomfort” of those 
women undergoing a reproductive 
egg donation: $5,000 or less in most 
circumstances, but up to $10,000 with 
appropriate justification. Payments 
over $10,000 are considered inap-
propriate since they may constitute 
coercion. Under these guidelines, the 
woman is not being paid for the egg, 
but instead her commitment to the 
procedure.  However, often the impor-
tance of the donor’s physical traits, 
mental fitness and ethnicity on many 
donor websites belies a greater stake in 
the traits of the eggs than the donor’s 
“commitment.” Some traits mentioned 
on the sites include “race,” “ethnic-
ity,” “skin tone,” “eyes,” “hair color,” 
“hair texture,” “height” and “weight.” 

This detailed screening of candidates 
reveals that it is possible that a donor is 
not being compensated, but instead, a 
baby is being sold. Consequently, some 
egg donation companies often forgo 
ASRM’s guidelines, and it has been 
reported that some women are paid 
upwards of $50,000 for their eggs.  

In order to combat the possibility 
of coercion, other countries, such as 
the United Kingdom, do not allow 
any compensation for the egg retrieval 
procedure. While this approach may 
decrease the population of possible egg 
donors, it protects disadvantaged or 
uninformed women from being lured 
into the egg donation procedure with 
promises of high payments. This dras-
tic approach may be too extreme for 
many; nevertheless, there is a call for 
greater regulation in the United States. 
Perhaps legal restrictions could be a 
remedy; Arizona has already passed 
legislation requiring specific guidelines 
for informed consent of the patient. 
In any case, the first step to protect 
future egg donors is education. UCSD 
in particular put together a reproduc-
tive rights exhibit called 16 Days of 
Activism, which started Nov. 25. This 
event focuses on controversial topics, 
ranging from abortion to egg dona-
tion. Contact the campus Women’s 
Center for more information.

state budget did restore $199 mil-
lion that was cut in 2009-10, Yudof ’s 
annual student fee increases and the 
state’s lack of commitment to higher 
education funding means that this 
clause is unlikely to come into play.

Refusing to ratify the contract 
doesn’t mean that all the discontents’ 
demands will be conceded to, or even 
that they should be. But compared to 
settling for a binding three-year com-
mitment that does little to improve 
their standard of living, there’s not 
much for the union to lose. 

Under the California Public 
Employee Relations Act, employers 
must propose their final offer, then 
petition to declare impasse after the 

union rejects this offer. This means 
that if there is later negotiation — 
like the one advocated by Malone 
— an employer cannot produce 
something worse than the original 
“best and final” offer.

Of course, everyone is taking hits 
right now. Undergraduate tuition just 
rose again, departments are downsiz-
ing and class sizes are growing larger. 
We’re in a budget crunch, but it still 
needs to put its money where its values 
are: the professors and students that 
constitute the core of the universities. 
Instead, executives spent $2 million 
last year on bottled water alone — $2 
million that could go toward bridging 
that $1,000 monthly gap in pay, or 
for increasing childcare reimburse-

ments (which would cost an estimated 
$500,00). The union’s demand of a 
4-percent increase would cost $6 mil-
lion a year — a hefty sum, to be sure, 
but UCOP gave out $11 million in 
executive bonuses last year. 

Students systemwide have been 
against fee increases and eager to 
lobby the Board of Regents and the 
state for more funding, more money 
and better conditions. This attitude 
should extend to all students, not 
just undergraduates. While we don’t 
have the resources to meet all of the 
union’s demands — meaning the 
union might have to cross the new 
pony off their wishlist — hard times 
are no excuse to stop fighting for our 
model of a perfect university.

Dec. 10 — People will 
watch “The Tourist” 
for one reason only: 
The upcoming action 
flick pairs powerhouse 
actors Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie for the first time. Filmed in 
Venice, Italy, the film follows an unexpected love affair between naïve 
American tourist Frank Taylor (Depp) and British femme fatale 
Elise Ward (Jolie), as Frank gets sucked into Elise’s world of interna-
tional intrigue, chases and gunfights galore. The film is a Hollywood 
remake of the 2005 French film “Anthony Zimmer,” and the cast gets 
a glamorous update, including ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton. 

The pedigree of the actors elevates “The Tourist” a couple notch-
es above your typical spy thriller, and the millions eager to see Depp 
and Jolie make out will surely help it rake in money at the box office.

words: Academy Award-winner Jeff 
Bridges. Nearly 30 years later, Bridges 
has returned to his iconic role of Kevin 
Flynn. Now rocking the grizzled white 
beard of old age, he brings wisdom to 
his reprised role, and, lucky us, audi-
ences get a double dose. Bridges also 
plays primary antagonist Clu 2.0, a digi-
tal copy of younger Kevin Flynn that 
betrayed its creator and trapped him in 
the computer world.

Enter newcomer Garrett Hedlund 
as Kevin’s son Sam Flynn. When his 

search for his lost dad brings him to the 
digital world, father and son, with the 
help of fighter program Quorra (Olivia 
Wilde), team up to fight their way back 
to the real world. Top this all off with

masses in support of his genocidal 
mission. Prince Albert, or “Bertie,” 
(Colin Firth) suddenly finds himself 
with a heavy cross to bear — the pres-
tigious moniker of “King George VI”, 
bestowed on him when his brother 

David (Guy Pearce) 
abdicates the throne to 
pursue a romance with 
an American woman.  
Weighed down with the 
ever-growing sorrows and 
expectations of a nation, 
he struggles — with the 

help of his doting wife Elizabeth (Helena 
Bonham Carter) and speech therapist 
Lionel (Geoffery Rush)  — to rid himself 
of a crippling speech impediment, and 
learn to speak on behalf of a nation.

“The King’s Speech” never makes the 
struggles of King George’s reign poignant 

enough to inspire sympathy for the bur-
geoning monarch. Instead, the focus is on 
Bertie as a man, not a king. He’s someone 
who is crippled by his inability to speak 
through years of childhood neglect.

As Bertie, Firth had considerable 
hurdles to overcome; inspiring sympathy 
for a character so frequently prone to 
bouts of mute rage (and rather unmuted 
rudeness) is not a small undertaking. 
Traditionally, speech impediments are 
seen as sources of amusement, or lack of 
intellect — children grow up watching 
the bumbling Sylvester the Cat lisp his 
way through cartoons. But with Firth 
on the throne, Bertie’s choked silence is 
never a barrier for emotion or prickly 
wit. He curses, laughs, confides, raves, 
tears and loves, mostly silently, occa-
sionally set to a humbled stutter.  Each 
word inspires an enigmatic passion; the 
actor’s face is drawn, then suddenly slack, 

riddled with the excruciating effort of 
breathing sound into his thoughts, his 
mind hastily moving forward before 
his paralytic mouth can recover.  Rush’s 
Lionel is a well-penned complement 
— he is daring, stubborn and eloquent 
— but the spotlight decidedly belongs to 
Firth.

Most importantly, “The King’s Speech” 
is intimate. The banter is typically a volley 
between both men (and Carter, equally 
delightful, frequently gets in on the fun). 
At their first meeting, Lionel asks Bertie 
if he knows any jokes, to which he replies 
(after considerable stammering and 
delay), “Timing isn’t my strong suit.”  

But for Firth, timing is everything. 
With last year’s “Best Actor” nomination 
in tow, his lively performance as Bertie 
might have the man taking the stage for 
a speech no one dreads — and walking 
away with a golden statuette in hand.

WINTER MOVIE PREVIEW

THE FIGHTER
Dec. 10 — Though we’ve had 
our fill of the boxing-underdog 
archetype, volatile director David 
O’Russell and a hauntingly gaunt 
Christian Bale give “The Fighter” a 
few knockouts in its corner to keep 
us guessing.

“Irish” Micky Ward (Mark 
Wahlberg) is a struggling boxer 
looking to make a name for himself, 
with brother/mentor Dicky (Bale) 
as his trainer. After a string of 
defeats and family-related trauma, 
Micky starts to show promise, 
thanks to the help of sassy girlfriend 
Charlene (Amy Adams) and his 
managerial team — but his family 
isn’t willing to let him walk away 
that easily. 

The weak spot in “The Fighter’s” 
tough-guy strut seems to be vanilla leading man Marky Mark. 
Fortunately, Wahlberg and Russell have made good partners 
before (“I Heart Huckabees”), making it hard to sideline “The 
Fighter” for this Oscar season.

For Bale — the ass-o-holic method actor that denies being, 
well, a method actor (and sometimes a regular person) — the 
dickish attention to detail is paying off. His transformation 
from the stoic, washboard-abed Batman to cracked-out Dicky 
is startling. Between Dicky’s brawls, delusional behavior and 
slurred speech, it’s a wonder Bale’s body emerged unscathed 
post-film  — and if his dedication doesn’t work the Academy, 
nothing will.

Dec. 17 — “How Do You

Manny (Owen Wilson) and,

RABBIT HOLE

Dec. 22 — It’s good to be a Coen Brothers fan. From “Fargo” 
and “The Big Lebowski” to “No Country For Old Men” and 
last year’s hugely overlooked “A Serious Man,” the hardest- 
working duo in filmmaking seems to have a limitless cache of 
instant classics up their sleeves. And if the menacing, “OMG” 
trailer for “True Grit” — an adaptation of the darkly comic, 
1968 Charles Portis western novel — is anything to go by, 
they’re not planning on taking a break any time soon. 

The infinitely badass, eye patch-sporting Jeff Bridges leads 
as U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (played by none other than 
John Wayne in the 1969 Oscar-winning original). The film 
chronicles the story of a 14-year-old Mattie Ross (newcomer 
Hailee Steinfeld) who commissions the help of Cogburn 

and a Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Matt Damon) to track 
down her father’s murderer — a drifter named Tom Chaney 
(Josh Brolin). Frequent Coen collaborator Carter Burwell 
delivers an epic score to match the film’s dark content, com-
plete with thundering percussion and haunting, Protestant 
hymns. 

Even with just a movie trailer to go off of, the thought of a 
gun-toting, bloodthirsty Arkansas tween giving grown men a 
run for their money (not to mention, it’s the goddamn Coen 
brothers) should be enough to keep the theaters packed and 
the Oscar nods coming.

 Dec. 17 —“Rabbit Hole,” an adaptation of a 2005 Tony 
Award-nominated play by David Lindsay-Abaire, possesses 
all the components of the too-familiar Hollywood tearjerker 
formula: a sudden death, two grief-stricken parents, a dis-
traught wife banging on her steering wheel, all wrapped in 
a broken marriage. In this case, Becca and Howie Corbett 
(played by Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart) are struggling 
to cope after their four-year-old son dies suddenly in a car 
accident. 

Both parents have different ways of coping with the loss. 
Becca becomes oddly fixated on her son’s teenage killer, 
Jason, while Howie remains focused on the past, holding in 
his anger. Their conflicting reactions inevitably cause a rift 
between the couple. 

Judging by the trailer’s mournful piano numbers and long 
shots of parents staring at old photographs, there will be few 
positive moments in the film’s 91 minutes. Potential viewers 
might wonder if the flick bears too much similarity to the 
unsolved depression they saw from Kidman in “The Hours.” 
“Rabbit Hole” does, but even so, “Rabbit Hole” does, at least, 
promise award-caliber performances from its leads.

Daft Punk
Tron: Legacy OST
WALT DISNEY RECORDS

T he soundtracks for upcoming Disney movies aren’t usually the subject 
of media anticipation, but 
the score for “Tron: Legacy” 
breaks the mold for one 
reason and one reason only: 
Daft Punk.  The thought 
of the famed French house 
duo commanding a massive 
85-piece orchestra has sent 
legions of fans into an over-
joyed frenzy. Throw in some 
fan-produced tracks that 
leaked earlier this year (and 
were actually kinda good), 
and it’s hard to beat the hype. 

But even with over-
whelmingly high expecta-
tions, Tron: Legacy proves to 
be an enormous accomplish-
ment. The mixture of classi-
cal instruments and digital 
synthesizers is exactly the 
kind of bold experimenta-
tion Daft Punk is famous 
for, and exactly the kind of 
pairing that appeals to fans 
(and everyone else, for that 
matter).

But don’t go in expecting 
anything like “Harder, Better, 
Faster, Stronger”; this is far 
from a typical Daft Punk 
album. “The Grid” starts 
the journey with the only 
vocals on the soundtrack — 
provided by “Tron” star Jeff 
Bridges — leading the way. 
“I kept dreaming of a world 
I thought I’d never see. And 
then, one day, I got in,” he 

explains over an escalating 
beat, instilling an unparal-
leled sense of discovery. 
“Recognizer” follows and 
chronicles both Sam Flynn’s 
and our own first push into 
the dark, digital world of the 
movie. Sharp violins and low 
synth get progressively louder 
and more dissonant, stirring 
the thrill of excitement that 
characterizes the plunge into 
the heroic adventure. 

While most of the 
soundtrack has little in com-
mon with Daft Punk’s prior 
work, their electronica roots 
show up from time to time. 
“Derezzed” is exactly what 
you imagined Daft Punk’s 
score would sound like; it’s 
loud and it’s fast and it pro-
vides an adrenaline rush. The 
same goes for “End Titles” — 
with its electronic power and 
uplifting rhythm, it promises 
to keep theatre seats full dur-
ing the credits.

 In the end, their mixture 
of classical and digital doesn’t 
get a party started quite like 
“One More Time,” but it is 
still a magnificent work by 
the unstoppable Daft Punk. 
And who knows? It may 
force the robots out of hiding 
and into suits at the Oscars. 
“Best Score” could very well 
be within their reach.

Robotic Duo Craft Waves For Tron

Nicki Minaj
Pink Friday
YOUNG MONEY

A t this point, it’s impos-sible to talk about Nicki Minaj without men-
tioning her verse on Kanye 
West’s “Monster.” Rhyming 
“Sri Lanka” with “Tonka” 
and “Willy Wonka” in vio-
lently cartoonish form, Minaj 
eclipsed appearances by 
Jay-Z, Rick Ross and Kanye 
himself. It was undoubtedly 
one of the greatest things 
to happen to rap this year 
and almost singlehandedly 
cemented Minaj’s position 
among the legacy of sexually 
aggressive, socially conscious 
female rappers like Lil’ 
Kim and Missy Elliot. But 
unfortunately, Minaj’s highly 
anticipated debut album, 
Pink Friday, fails to match the 
manic genius of “Monster,” 
which is disappointing, espe-
cially since she seems capable 
of so much more than this 
unremarkable album.

The album’s most sig-
nificant flaw is that, although 
Minaj is a superb rapper, she 
is at best a mediocre singer. 
And much of the album con-
sists of traditional R&B tracks 
like “Right Thru Me,” “Save 
Me” and “Your Love.” While 
they’re all decent songs, they 
pale in comparison to Minaj’s 
unhinged rap work. But that’s 
the best of them — some 
of the songs here cross the 
line into unlistenable terri-
tory. The will.i.am-produced 

“Check It Out,” based on a 
sample of “Video Killed The 
Radio Star” by The Buggles, 
is cringe-worthy in its cheesi-
ness.

But when Minaj raps, she’s 
totally on top.  Eminem col-
laboration “Roman’s Revenge” 
has hints of the insane genius 
that made Minaj’s early work 
so refreshing: seemingly 
random vocal and character 
changes, off-beat rhymes, an 
undeniable commitment to 
her sheer lunacy. “I’m startin’ 
to feel like a dungeon dragon/
Raah, raah, like a dungeon 
dragon,” she barks. Her raps 
are even good enough to 
upstage Eminem’s clumsy 
attempt at reprising his Slim 
Shady persona; Minaj just 
does crazy so much better. 

The album’s best track 
“Did It On ‘Em” — which 
contains a booming, 
Bangladesh-produced beat — 
is equally absurd, with Minaj 
gleefully asserting that, “If I 
had a dick, I would pull it out 
and piss on ‘em.”

It’s these moments that 
prove Minaj still has a lot 
more in store for us. While 
Pink Friday certainly has its 
lows, it still proves that Minaj 
is one of the most promising 
rappers — male or female — 
around.

Robyn
Body Talk
KONICHIWA

R obyn has been making strides on the other side of the Atlantic since the 
late ‘90s, crafting relentlessly 
sweet synth-pop that, for 
whatever reason, has yet to 
break the surface of the U.S. 
mainstream. But on Body 
Talk Pt. 3 — the conclu-
sion of a three-part series 
that includes five new songs 
and five tracks each from 
this year’s Body Talk Pt.1 
and Body Talk Pt. 2 — the 
Swedish artist showcases the 
explosive confidence of a 
full-fledged pop star. 

Singles “Indestructible” 
and “Dancing On My Own” 
glimmer with ‘80s synthe-
sizers, fronted by Robyn’s 
powerful-but-lovelorn lyrics, 
delivered with searing brava-
do. The former track’s “screw 
you” vibe is reminiscent of 
last year’s “Bulletproof” by 
fellow European electro-
poppers La Roux. “I let the 
bad ones in and the good 
ones go/But I’m gonna love 
you like I’ve never been hurt 
before,” she croons.  

Despite the occasional 
overdone lyrical content, 
Body Talk is never stale. In 
“Fem Bot,” a delightfully 
spastic, half-rapped verse 
slides into a sexy, ethe-
real chorus, while the campy 
dub of Diplo-produced 
“Dancehall Queen” manages 
to weave in an electro-ska 

breakdown. Snoop Dogg 
even stops by on “U Should 
Know Better” — a globe-
trotting, fast-paced hit list 
of people who “know bet-
ter than to fuck with me” 
(the Russians, the Vatican, 
the CIA and the Prince of 
Darkness, to name a few). It’s 
an entertaining and surpris-
ingly funny detour from the 
standard dance-pop, not to 
mention the most interesting 
thing Snoop has done in the 
last few years (no, “California 
Gurls” doesn’t count). 

But it’s moments like 
on the soaring “Call Your 
Girlfriend” and flashback 
love song “Hang With Me” 
that hit our sappy, vulner-
able cores, revealing the 
naive teenage girl inside. 
Sometimes — Robyn assures 
us — you need to put that 
rugged machismo aside and 
just dance the pain away.

Those who pray that Lady 
GaGa will someday find 
the sleek, inventive sound 
to match her futuristic-
Christmas-tree persona, look 
no further. We have Robyn 
to cure our pop depres-
sion — and the exciting 
and outrageously infectious 
(though imperfect) Body 
Talk is a clear reminder that 
we should be damn thankful 
we do.

HIATUSÊ THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIANÊ9

E astern Congo has been through two ethnic wars, political ruin and political faction, but these conflicts take a backseat in “Ruined,” Lynn Nottage’s riveting exposition of female 
strength, now playing at the La Jolla Playhouse. 

Despite the word being in the title, no one lays out the meaning 
of the word “ruined” in Nottage’s play. It’s a euphemism for rape 
and refers to when eighteen-year-old Sophie (Carla Duren) is sexu-
ally assaulted by her uncle Christian (Oberon K.A. Adjepong). 

In a war where women’s bodies are the spoils of victory, Sophie 
and two other young women find shelter in Mama Nadi’s whore-
house, where militants must cast aside their weaponry to enter. 
Mama, played animatedly by Tonye Patano, is the cock-grabbing, 
business-minded Sue Sylvester of the Congo. She speaks with the 

conviction of experience and scoffs at Sophie and Salima’s (Pascale 
Armand) trashy romance novels in which, unlike the real world, 
“everything is forgiven by a kiss.” Despite her rigid exterior, Mama 
bears unconditional sympathy for Sophie — an anomaly that goes 
unexplained until the play’s end. 

Mama’s disregard for politics catches up to her in the form of 
Commander Osembenga (Adrian Roberts). She doesn’t give a 
damn about the men who walk through her door, and welcomes 
opposing factions in the Congo’s ethnic war. Osembenga’s discov-
ery that rebels have also been served at the whorehouse leads to a 
struggle to keep her place safe.

American audiences are not privy to the internal conflict of 
the Congo, but promises of democracy that the Congolese govern-

ment doles out at the expense of human lives are achingly familiar 
(Iraq and Afghanistan, anyone?).  But Nottage isn’t interested in 
political warfare so much as gendered conflict. For her, the female 
body is its own war zone, an implication made clear when Salima 
proclaims to the militiamen, “You will not fight your battles on my 
body.” 

The rickety set, designed by Clint Ramos, further underscores 
the play’s concept of ruins. Adorned with Christmas lights and 
a vintage Pepsi stand, Mama’s whorehouse is a hodgepodge of 
decorations. Despite its overly eclectic appearance, the set never 
changes, providing an anchor in an intense play. 

The Afro-beat score provided by the drums of Alvin Terry and 
electric guitar of Adesoji Odukogbe is less a backdrop than part of 
the action, becoming the live band that accompanies Sophie’s sing-
ing. To pull us further into the atmosphere, the women of Mama’s 
whorehouse dance into the audience. The smell of cigarette smoke 
and the sprinkling of French words in the dialogue immerse the 
play in realism.

Directed by South African native Liesl Tommy, the production 
demands attention for its large-scale social commentary. Given the 
play’s handling of abduction, rape, prostitution and botched abor-
tions, thematic intensity is in no shortage. But “Ruined” is still a 
departure from the grief binge of many dramatizations of Africa. 

The play is about hope in a time of struggle. The running gag 
of unrequited love between Christian and Mama provides comic 
relief, while the potential of an operation for Sophie, despite its 
costs, is yet another silver lining. In fact, Sophie croons a meta-
phor throughout the play that reminds us of the female characters’ 
tenacity in times of struggle: “Life’s a green mango cracked too 
soon,” she sings, “but if it survives, it will ripen in the sun.”  

Like the women it portrays, “Ruined” evokes sympathy and 
admiration. Nottage gives voice to the women of war who, instead 
of being victimized, find strength in one another.

When you know it’s going to 
take your absolute best 
performance to make the 
grade, you can give your brain 
a boost with Study Buddy™, 
an ingenious supplement now 
available at two convenience 
stores on the UCSD campus.

Study Buddy™ is brainpower 
in a package created 

specifically for university 
students.

“Study Buddy was developed 
with natural ingredients that 
help students perform better,” 
says Tyler Johansen, company 
founder. “Campus life and 
curriculum demands 
occasionally collide, but 
professors rarely are 

sympathetic about these 
‘scheduling conflicts.’ Study 
Buddy is the answer. It helps 
improve mental performance.”

According to Company 
literature, Study Buddy™ was 
designed to:

Improve Focus
Improve Memory
Improve Mental Clarity
Improve Mental Stamina 
Improve Recollection

Johansen believes students are 
faced with so many academic, 
economic and social pressures 
that staying sharp and focused 
all the time is difficult. 

“Study Buddy is a safe, 
effective supplement that helps 
improve memory, 
concentration and focus.”

Study Buddy™ is available 
next to the cash register at 
Sunshine Market and Perks 
Café.

Overall, colleges can only turn a 
profit off football and basketball. But 
this does not mean every school with 
a football and basketball team makes 
money, since only the big-time pro-
grams can get in the black.  To get to 
this level, the UCSD sports depart-
ment and the school administration 
need to work together. First of all, 
athletes need to want to come here for 
school. Check. 

But UCSD does not plan to change 
admission standards for incoming 
student-athletes. As it stands, special 
admit requirements are roughly a 3.4 
GPA and a 1700 SAT score. For those 
of you who don’t know, most superior 
athletes do not come with superior 
brains. The athletes at UCSD are, for 
the most part, exceptions, as the uni-
versity has one of the top programs 
in the nation when both athletics and 
academics are taken into account. Yet 
we still mostly find success in skill-
oriented sports, such as baseball and 
the field events in track and field, 
where pure athleticism is not as much 
of an issue. 

In the big ball sports like basket-
ball and football, skill is extremely 
important, but you need big, superior 
athletes to have a chance. Generally, 
those are the athletes that placed a 
very low level of priority on education 
in high school, relying on athleticism, 
instead of grades, to get those admis-
sions letters.

So UCSD faces an important ques-
tion: Do we want to be a great D-1 
school, or do we want to get murdered 
while retaining the academic integrity 
of the student body? 

I think we can have both. Stanford 
is the best example of a great program 
with a high level of competitiveness 
athletically (ranked second in the 
nation as an overall program) and an 
exceptional level of academic integrity 
(ranked 14th in the world). 

To attain both of these elusive 
goals, UCSD needs some fundamen-

tal changes. First, and foremost for 
many, student fees will need to be 
increased for athletics. Moving divi-
sions is an expensive investment, and 
the money has to come from some-
where

Furthermore, the admission 
rate for incoming freshmen will 
need to drop by several percentage 
points. Such a drop has shown to 
make schools more lucrative, since 
the appearance of exclusivity is often 
more effective than actual education-
al merit, which UCSD has already. 
This drop will also allow the athletics 
department to get in more special 
admits without affecting the overall 
average. Thus, the prestige of our aca-
demics would go up, and we would be 
able to get the big bodies we need to 
compete at the next level in basketball 
and a possible football future.

These changes are necessary to 
be competitive at the next level while 
retaining academic prowess, and 
maybe even increasing it.

While many will not like the idea 
of athletes getting into school with 
a lower GPA, there are two sides of 
the coin. Many of those individu-
als would not be going to college at 
all without sports, because of either 
their level of intelligence or their eco-
nomic background. Growing up, at 
least half of my friends from high 
school sports either could not afford 
college or could not get good grades 
because they had to help pay for their 
families with a job on the side. Also, 
these people that get in with a lower 
GPA worked just as hard or harder 
than many with higher GPAs, just in 
another field. Those with significant 
athletic ability did not get it on acci-
dent. That work ethic can be applied 
to the classroom and business later 
on. 

UCSD is going into a bright D1 
future. The process is slow and the 
current atmosphere is difficult, but 
the school has the potential to fulfill 
its stated vision “as being one of the 
premier NCAA athletics programs in 
the nation.”

Costly,ÊButÊCouldÊHelpÊUniversity to his choice of colleges, Stanford University, he came 

to UCSD to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. 
Madsen decided not to go out for water polo, but taking 
a year off provided him with the proof he needed that 
he wanted water polo to again be an important part of 
his life. 

“To be honest, that one year I had off, it was almost 
like school was harder for me,” Madsen said.  “I didn’t 
want to go to school; I’d just want to sit home. Playing 
polo was a reason I had to go to school because I had 
to go to practice.”

The switch from focusing solely on schoolwork to a 
balance between the pool and the classroom turned out 
to be a positive one for Madsen. Rather than being a 
distraction from his work-intensive engineering degree, 
the sport gave him structure that allowed him to suc-
ceed at both playing polo and keeping up with classes. 

“It kept me in line and gave me a schedule,” Madsen 
said. “I’d go to practice, and then homework, and then 
practice again, then homework, then go home. So 
[water polo] definitely helped me get through these 
years.”

At 5’11”, Madsen is considered short in the water 
polo world, and saw limited playing time in his first 
year on the team. During his first year, his confidence 
in his ability as a player initially earned him grief from 
the senior players, but ultimately served him well over 
the three years he played for UCSD. 

“I came in thinking I could play with anyone,” 
Madsen said. “But there were some good players, so I 
thought, ‘Well if I’m going to be as good as these guys, 
I’ve got to work harder.’” 

But UCSD is not known for having large players, and 
employs a counter-attacking strategy due to the squad’s 
size disadvantage. Head coach Denny Harper focuses 
mainly on getting his players to be quick and mobile, 
and being able to tire out the teams they compete with. 
As a driver and counter attacker, Madsen grew to play 
a crucial role. In his junior year, Madsen played on the 
team with 37 goals and added 20 assists. This year, dur-
ing his senior campaign, he was third on the team with 
26 goals and another 20 assists. Madsen said that his 
self-described cockiness helped him persevere despite 
being one of the smaller guys in the pool.

“You have to go up against another player knowing 
you can beat him,” he said. “And if you aren’t cocky, 
don’t have the confidence, it’s not going to happen.”

The team suffered a disappointing year, finish-
ing fourth in the Western Water Polo Association 
Championships and losing to Santa Clara University for 
the first time in school history. There was no Hollywood 
ending for Madsen, but he couldn’t say enough about 
how much he enjoyed his time on the team.

“Being on a team with the guys, especially this team 
at UCSD — we all get along,” Madsen said. “The coach-
es do a good job of choosing players based on their 
personalities and skills, so everyone interacts really well 

here. Just hanging with the guys before practice, after 
practice, wherever we are, it’s always a good time.”

Looking back on his time at UCSD, Madsen revealed 
that despite the school not being his first choice, it 
ended up being perfect for him. From excellent surf 
beaches (Madsen is an avid surfer), the renowned 
engineering program and the great water polo team, 
Madsen found an environment in which he could truly 
flourish. 

Now that he is about to graduate, Madsen has hopes 
of continuing to play polo in the future. He aspires to 
find a job as an engineer that will allow him both to 
travel and to join a club team, most likely in Australia. 
Although engineering comes first and he acknowledged 
that the strength and endurance he gained from play-
ing for UCSD is something he would not easily achieve 
again in his life, he said he will not give up on his pas-
sion for the sport.

“College would not be the same if I didn’t have water 
polo,” he said. “I tried going my first year without it and 
[I realized] you’re here to go to school, but it’s just not 
the same when you just go to school. Water polo gives 
you something else. For me it gave me a balance.”

Both the weather and the College of Saint Rose will be tough oppo-
nents for the Tritons on Thursday. Louisville has seen snow flurries over 
the last several days, and forecasts say there is a 20-percent chance of 
snow for the 11 a.m. PST kickoff. 

The Golden Knights of Saint Rose — based in Albany, NY — are a little 
more accustomed to inclement weather, but both squads are a long way 
from home on an unfamiliar pitch. The Golden Knights ended the regular 
season undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the nation, but haven’t exactly 
breezed through the tournament. St. Rose advanced on a pair of 1-0 wins 
and a victory in penalty kicks in the quarterfinals. 

The Golden Knights are making their third straight appearance in the 
Final Four and have a definite experience edge on the pitch, but certainly 
not on the touchline. UCSD head coach Brian McManus is going for his 
third D-II title and eighth overall, with the last one coming in 2001. The 
Tritons come in unbeaten in 17 out of their last 18 matches, and with 29 
goals scored and 6 allowed in that span.

Standing Tall, Playing Big

At an academically demanding university like UCSD, it can be hard to find a balance between pursuing a meaningful degree and leading a gratifying per-
sonal life. For Bryce Madsen, the secret is water polo.

The senior driver just completed his third and final 
season on UCSD’s water polo team, in a campaign that saw 
the team finish 13-13 overall. Madsen has been vital to the 
team’s success, but it wasn’t always that way.

Madsen started playing water polo at an early age, at the 
urging of his father. Like many children, Madsen played 
youth soccer, but tried out water polo at age 12 and never 
looked back. He took to the sport instantly, and it became 
an important aspect of his life.

“Because I excelled so quickly, [water polo] became the 

most fun thing to do for me,” Madsen said. “As I got better 
and better, it was more something I did with my life.”

Madsen played for Marina High School in Huntington 
Beach, helping the team to the state quarterfinals in his 
senior season. He also joined a club water polo team in the 
offseason, playing alongside some of the best high school 
players in the area. Several of his teammates went on to play 
at powerhouses such as Long Beach State and USC, and 
faced off against Madsen later in their careers. 

Madsen, unlike his club teammates, was not immedi-
ately convinced he wanted to continue his water polo career 
beyond the high school level. After being denied admission
