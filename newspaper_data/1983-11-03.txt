ThLs fall 13,682 students enrolled in 
UCSD, a figure up 574 over last years 
enrollment. 141,319 students enrolled 
on the nine University of California 
campuses, according to registration 
figures released today (Monday', October 
31). The headcount total is 2,154 more 
students than last year's fall enrollment 
of 139,165 and is the highest in UC's 
history. (The previous high was last 
year.) Undergraduate enrollment on the 
eight general campuses now stands at 
103,032, an increase of 2,642 students 
over last year. In the health sciences, 
enrollment declined by 293 students, 
from 12,638 to 12,345. Graduate 
students in non-health science prograrru 
total H,9tt2 in the UC system, down by 
195 students from last year. 

• 
Regents of the University of California 

have approved the entire agenda for 
their October meeting, including UC's 
budget request for 1984-85. UC 
President David P. Gardner advised the 
Regents that preliminary enrollment 
figures indicate an Increase of about 
2,500 undergraduates over the 91,725 
students for which UC is budgeted in 
1983-84. In closed session, the .Regents 
approved appointments and salaries for 
a University ~uditor and a letters and 
science dean at Berkeley. They made 
further steps toward the University's 
establishment of a Natural Land and 
Water Reserves System by authorizing 
the purchase of land, execution of leases 
and the settlement of pending lawsuits. 
The Regents also approved above-scale 
salaries for certain unmentioned faculty . 

A $5,000 check to support research 
on night blindness in former prisoners-
of-war has been presented to Stuart 
Brown, MD , of the UCSD School of 
Medicine by the American Ex-Prisoners-
of-War, Inc. According to Brown, who is 
chairman of the Department of 
Ophthalmology, studies have shown that 
many POWs suffer from night blindness 
shortly after their release from 
imprisonment. However, no follow-up 
studies have been conducted to 
investigate the long-range impairment to 
sight suffered by ex-POWs, Brown said. 
Miller said such a study could benefit 
the 94,000 ex-POWs currently living in 
this country as wep as others who suffer 
from night blindness.

UCSDeja Vu 
1971. .. 

A little known yet highly amusing 
sub-culture has evolved at UCSD. a 
culture in which literature is the 
dominant mode of artistic creativity. 
Strangely enough, the roots of this new 
renaissance stem from one of the most 
unlikely places imaginable - the 
lavatory. Indeed, If brevity is the soul of 
wit, this new, highly stylistic art, that of 
writing graffiti, IS among one of the 
most humorous aspects of college life. 
Here are some examples: (I) This is 
where Napoleon (Ore his Bonaparte , (2) 
Boredom, my friend, is fear (0 get away 
from oneself and create . and (3) 
Revolutionary change is necessary if the 
graffiti is to improve. 
1972. .. 

At 10:30 Wednesday night, students 
constructed what they termed "A 
Vietnamese hamlet" In the Muir dorms 
plaza. Sporting such signs as "UCSD join 
the Navy," the hamlet was constructed to 
welcome Navy recruiters to UCSD, a forum 
for their VISIt. During the evenT the 
recruiters responded to such statements 
as, "The US has commilled war crimes 
against humanity with their 
indiscriminate bombing." The usual reply 
to these statements was, "[ don't know 
anything about it." At a rally attended by 
approximately ISO people , a South 
Vietnamese student spoke, "[ am speaking 
as an official representative of outh 
Vietnam and as a human being," Pomtlng 
out that he is considered a traitor by the 
South Vietnamese Government, the 
Vietnamese student claimed , "I will receive 
the death penalty as soon as I land at a 
South Viemamese airport. "I favor peace," 
he proclaimed . "I am speaking out against 
the killings On one hand I admit being a 
traitor to the South Vietnamese 
Government, but on the other hand I am a 
human being, and I hate kiUing, not 
people." 
1976 . .. 

A debate on God and mIracles is set for 
tomOrrow mght. This debate promises to 

be more interesting than all of the 1976 
preSidential candidate encounters. After 
all, who can upstage God. Dr. Zeno 
Vendler, UCSD professor of philosophy, 
and Dr. Norman Geisler, professor of 
philosophy at Trinity Evangelical 
Seminary, will debate the topic, "Can 
Miraculous Events Occur in a Space-Time 
World?" In rderence to the question of 
miracles, speCific anention Will be given to 
the resurrection of Jesus. "Events wiU be 
dIscussed historically, philosophicaUy, 
and rationally: said George POSt, head of 
the sponsoring organization, Campus 
Crusade. "We know there was aJesus. We 
know he was crucified. Now can we 
determine ifhe was raised from the dead?"

A Letter to the Editor: 
Self-righteous indignation must be quite 

a trip , at least Peter F. Laura thinks so. Did 
it ever occur to you that readers of the Daily 
Guardian find your views on the Guardian's 
article about the extreme political rhetoric 
put forth by Ronald Reagan to be 
inaccurate? This conclusion LS more than 
probable given that you rdute the 
usefulness of logic , which IS the 
foundation of any worthy remark. Perhaps 
you would find a better audience based on 
impulse or "conviction:' in your words, 
ra ther than fact. Your shaUow comparisons 
of life to tea panies and blood and sweat 
are trite. You even used them m 
consecutive sentences. Secondly, if you 
think that political factions possess a 
"peculiar sort of logic," It follows then that 
you believe the logiC of your own faction to 
be peculiar. I think most of the readers 
would agree that It is actually your personal 
opinion that is peculiar. Fmally your belief 
that politics is Justified by the strength of 
one's convictions amazes me the most. If 
this is the sole baSIS of leadership, then 
Reagan is more than qualified to t.ike 
office. I doubt this allowance was your 
Intention ; at any rate , I suggel>! that you

AS Forum 
"To me, no student has a reason, legitimately, to gripe about the way the AS 

spends their money if they haven't tried todo anythi ng about it," stated Muir AS 
Counc-il Representative Greg Kruse . "What we are looking for, what we nud is 
student input" 

Kruse suffe,s from the same problem that many on-campus programs share: 
dealing with student apathy. Describing himself as a "liaison" between Muir 
College and the AS Council, Kruse primarily looks for feedback on school 
programs and for projects that will improve the environment as a whole. After 
transferring here from Santa Bamara last year, Kruse ran for AS representative 
because he wanted to get involved in student government. "I always like getting 
involved in high school because • liked being in the student council: said 
Kruse, who is spending his first year on the ASUCSD. "II's not any kind of power 
rrip or anything. I just want to have a say on how my money is being spent." 

Kruse echoes what OIher council members and associated groups have said: 
that this' year's council works weU together. ". can only speak for the AS and 
Muir, but I would say that both are close-knit groups, and so a 101 can get done." 

The problems that this council faces are primarily due 10 lack of student 
input, but Kruse stated that the AS is trying to overcome the problems. For 
instance, the council set up a sutvey and information table near the hump twO 
weeks ago to receive student feedback. "We are trying to get students to give 
their input, and get them interested in how their money is spent." said Kruse . 
"They ought to have a say when we have 58 of theirs I reg fees I every quarter." 

Obviously, nOl everybody can be reached to give an opinion on evety issue 
that faces the council. Says Kruse: "the hard thing is getting a mass opinion. 
You need to interview at least teJ1 to fifteen percent of the student population 
before you can get an idea of what to do." • 

Kruse feels that members of the council are not representing student opinion 
adequately. Regarding last spring's referendum on the funding of theCalijOrnia 
Review, Kruse felt that his constituency was not represented. "I talked to a 
number of people, both at Muir and elsewhere, and everyone said that the 
California RcWw had as much right to be funded as any alternative media on 
campus. Most people. talked to said they wanted the Cahfornia Review to be 
funded. I think that it might have been the case of a vocal minOrity on the vote, 
because most people I talked to were in favor of funding." 

While caling himself the "Councilperson-at-Large" because of his vaguely 
defined duties, Kruse remarked that he is sometimes not seen as a "fuU-fledged" 
council member. "I don't think a lot of individual council members think this 
way. but evety now and then you do hear the saying, "Oh. he's just a council rep. 
People point to the fact that all council members have discretionary funds, and 
how the AS representatives get only $25 and the AS commissioners get SI00. I 
guess this is because it says !Omewhere that comissioners have preeminence 
and are placed above their peers." 

Kruse feels his job is to insure that student interests are adequately 
represented in d~ussions which often involve specialized knowledge or 
opinions. For instance, in the Coors boy<;otl vote, CommLssioners s«enmark, 
Hemperly, and President Lee all voted "on the basis of the tour they had taken of 
the Coors brewery in Colorado over the summer. and how they saw the issue. 
The people \ talked to at Muir said that they didn't want to boycott Coors: said 
Kruse. "They jUst asked why the AS has any right to tell them what beer they 
should drink." 

Adding insight to the never-ending boycott issue, Kruse said that "The 
boycott repeal was invalid . The rules committee met and decided that since 
everybody that was suppoed to vote didn't sign in, the vote was void. It looks 
like it will probably come up to a re-vote . We have two new representatives now. 
from Third and Warren, and Third has instructed its reps to vote 'no: lagainst 
the repeal] . The vote last time was 13-6. The only way the two-thirds vote would 
pass would be if the Warren rep voted 'yes.' It's spin right down the line." 

On Lisa Stenmark's accusation last week that the councLI is overly concerned 
with internal issues, Kruse replied '"I'rn not saying that the University should be 
isolated or anything, but we're a coUege council and we'te supposed to be 
concerned with coOege issues. We're nOl supposed to say whether Reagan 
should have invaded Grenada. That's politiCS that don't concern us. We are 
here to protect student issues. We have the ability to make endorsements of a 
particular bill that affects :;tudents. But I that's why] we have a lobby annex in 
Sacramento that takes .care of a lot of the external issues dw directly affect 
students." 

The school's radio stanon, KSDT, IS Kruse's pet project. He wants to see t~e 
student-operated station get an FCC license. But the process will not be easy. It s 
golOg to take a lot of work. I sat In on the last two meetings as KSDT-AS liaison. 1 
would like to see that IKSDT] become an on-air radio station," said Kruse. ·We 
are setting up a commiSSion with people from the telecommunications 
department to find out what must be done in the matter of getting KSDT its 
license. The student board has to make a recommendation to student 
organizations, who will make a recommendation to the chanceUor, who in 
tum will make a recommendation to the Regents, who make the formal 
request to the FCC. So it's a long ways off, and we would have to go to the 
Regents to get the money for the station. The project should be done. We 
need a good radio station ." 

Any words 01 adVIce to the readers? "Do omething," Kruse says "Get 
involved. This is your school. I f you I students] wa,1ll to make It better, we will 
listen ." . 

UCSD professors use their 
own books and reap royalties 
By STACEY DOSS 

Standing in the University Bookstore 
at the beginning of faD quarter and 
observing the masses of students from 
Math lA, 2B, 2C, 20 and 2DA scramble 
for copies of Cakulus and Ana~tlC 
Geometry, one suddenly realizes thaI due 
to th~ sales the books' author must be 
receiving a rather comfcrtable profit. 

Does Professor AI Shenk. author of 
Calculus and AnalytiC Geometry, and other 
UCSD professors whose books are used 
in UCSD courses receive royalties on 
their work? Do they receive royalties just 
for the books they require or for all 
copies sold , whether it is their course 
the book IS used for or not? 

"I receive royalties on all new copies 
sold; whetheH-·~ pm£essorpr 
whether it is another professor who is 
requiring the book," states Shenk. This 
does nOl only mean another UCSD 
professor, but any professor or OIher 
individual. 

Pal Garcia, manager of the 
coursebook section of the Universiry 
bookstore, estimates that approxImately 
375 to 500 copies If Shenk's Calculus 
and Ana!ytic Geometry are sold per 
quarter from the University Bookstore 
alone. The publisher of the book sells it 
to various bookstores and receives a ' 
profit, from whLch the author receives 
approximately 15% in royalties. 

Edmund Fantino, a psychology 
professor here at UCSD and co-author 
of IntroductIon to Contemporary Psychology 
with G.5. Reynolds and Experimental 
AnalySIS of Behavior. A Bio/ogtcal 
Pmptctillf with Cheryl Logan. says "1 get 
royalties no matter who in the world 
buys my book." 

Professors do nOl receive royalties on 
used books sold at the bookstore. These 
profits go directly to the University 
itself. 

How do royalties from course books 
affect the financial well-being of the 
professors who write them? Professor 
Stavrianos. author of Globat Rift, which 
was used at UCSD a few years back, 
says "An infinItesimaUy smail number of 
textbook sales by professors affect thei r 
fmancial status. I only received enough, 
let's say. to take myself and a few 
friends OUt on the town for a night. As 
far as academic income is concemed, 
it's negligible." 

The practice of using another 
professor's books is not a courtesy 
practice or simply a way of supporting 
colleagues. The books are used because 
instructors find them to be of academic 

quality. 
Fantino has only receIved one dIrect 

comment from peers concerning his 
book. A UC Berkeley professor told him 
that he cared for the book a great deal. 
The reason for its use, Fantino hoped. 
was that \I was an educationaUy useful 
piece of work, not that it waS written by 
a feUow UC professor. 

Professors select books for their 
courses on the basis of how they fit into 
their panlcular style of teaching, claims 
Stavrianos. "It's nOl a courtesy thing." 

About using Global Rift in his own 
course, Stavrianos was very unhappy. 
but smce there were no other books 
writ/en pertaining to the content of his 

c ourse , he 'was orce to use it. it 
cramped my style. I could not add much 
to my lectures. It was all in the book." 

There is a professor on campus. who

r,luses to receive royalties on the sale of 
his books if they are sold on any of the 
eight UC campuses. 

Professor Ken Bowles from the 
Electrical Engineering and Computer 
Sciences Depanment remembers 
running across a faculty rule clearly 
stating that professors should not 
receive royalties from books sold 
because the book is being required for 
,hat professor's course. (""I can't 
remember where I read it. I'm sure \( 
would be in any Campus Policy and 
Procedures Manual at any department 
office .") 

Upon reading this rule. Bowles 
informed his publisher, as well as his 
students via the. EECS 61 syllabus. that 
he would not receive royalties from 
books sold on any UC campus, not just 
UCSD. 

Upon reading this rule, Bowles 
informed his publisher. as well as his 
students via the EECS 61 syllabus, that 
he would not receive royalties from 
books sold on any UC campus, not JUSt 
UCSD. 

Bowles does receive royalties for 
books sold at non-UC campus 
bookstores, although very few of such 
books are sold . 

When asked how other professors are 
receiving royalties and getting away with 
it despite this rule , Bowles answered, "I 
honestly don't know." 

Shenk (Math), Fantino (Psychology) , 
Bowles (EECS). Stavrianos (HiStory) , 
Rodin (Math) , Braude , Petersdorf, Tisi 
and West (all medical professors) are a 
few of the UC 0 professors' names that 
have been in the past or -are seen- today 
on the shelves of course books in the

Editorial 

McNamara's view on ainns contrasts 
military reality with political theory 

On first impression, the Robert McNamara speaking before the UCSD 
Faculty Seminar on International Security seemed to have reversed his 
position on nuclear armamant by opposing the present Reagan policy. 
In fact McNamara reflects an attitude that has been the hallmark of our 
US security position since World War II. The sudden reversal has taken 
place in the Reagan Administration's political shift to a policy that 
existed between World War I and World War II , before the military 
reality of nuclear weapons existed. Over the past 30 years the NATO 
forces have accumulated an arsenal of 6,000 short-range, tactical nuclear 
weapoos to defend against a conventional Soviet invasion . For NATO 
countries the drawback to this form of milita7 readiness is that these 
short range weapons would inflict as much, i not more, damage on 
NATO allies inside their own territories than on the invasion force . 

In 1979, NATO proposed the deployment of strategic, intermediate-
range Pershing II missiles in order to move the casualty damage out of 

the NATO homeland and into Soviet territory in hopes ot destroying the 

Soviet military command center. The Reagan Administration argues this 
would be a stronger deterrent to a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, 
and he further claims this is a first step towards a future nuclear missile 
build-down to zero missiles world wide. Both.claims, McNamara assens, 
are not based on military or real world reality. 

To deploy Pershing II missiles in Western Europe increases the risk 
of a first strike being launched by a foreign power, or an accidental 
launching by a field commander, which would provoke a Soviet attack 
not on Europe but on the United States. The present arsenal of Polaris 
missiles is already a militarily recognized deterrent to any first-strike 
scenano. I-urthermore. a nuclear-tree luture would prOVIde no deterrence 
to a possible conventional Soviet invasion. Whether we like it or not, 
the military reality of the world does exist. No political hope or ambitio'n 
to save the world from aggreSSion could survive the devastating 
aftermath of an incorrect rhetorical theory.

what socialism is aU about 

So you see, whether intended or not, 
Tim's proposal will in fact aid the 
campus radicals in their cause. He 
deserves our support.

If I were the "feminist radical" that 
Mr. Belluci claims me to be (Letters, 
10/ 27), I might launch an anack on his 
crude display of chauvinism; instead, I 
will attempt to clarify the points made 
in the .mide on sexual discrimination 
( LO/ H). 

Sexual discrimination does occur in 
the classroom, but often in subtle ways 
that may go unnoticed by the student 
and professor. These forms of bias are 
primarily a reflection of age old societal 
views towards women, and not 
necessarily conscious attempts to 
discriminate on the pan of the 

, instructor. Awareness of this problem is 
the first step towards its elimination. 

The examples cited in the ankle were 
based on a repon by the Project on, the 
Status and Education of Women , funded 
by a grant from the US Depanment of 
Education, and also based on interviews 
with several students. Possibly I 
overlooked the importance of including 
these sources in the original anick 

In no way did I imply that male 
students get higher grades (if, indeed, 
they do) than women solely because 
they are male. If Mr. Belluci has earned 
better grades than his female friends, 
then it surely is a result or his natural 
intelligence and high level of motivation , 
not because of his gender.

Speaking of the Soviets: History has 
some lessons that should. not be forgotten 
By WILLIAM G. WIXTED III 

In response to the rebukes "f John 
Schacht, JaJMS RC6berg and JllieM 
Kiolbassa 10 Thomas Ritnkrn's Jnicle

Soviet Union. Mr. Rankin ingeniously 
lets Soviet words, ~ciflCaBy Yu,fs 
words. speak for themselves in his 
eloquent essay. But let us permit Sovier 
actions, instead, speak for themselves. 

In 1939, the Soviets cooperared wirh

brought back gmn warfare from the 
days of World War II in an anempr to 
exterminate the Afghans. With their 
pathedc rifles, the Afghans a~ no match

Soviets who speak ota apinst the

is a system which brutalizes and 
enslaws its peoplt. devaluing human

Soviets haw no flftdom of speKh. or

The liberal apoIopts in this country 
can spew their inanr dogma widMJUI 
fear of ~crimination from an)'OllC, but if 
they did the same in the Sovirt Union 
they would end up in a concentralion

to ignoR these realities ~r. 

Mr. Rosberg and Ms. Kioblssa make 
WlCII-takt'n points when they seek to

one will deny that these peoplt ha~ 
every reason in the world to rebel 
:Jgainst an unjust system. The question 
!O ask is this: whether EI Salvadoran 
mothers suffer the same fare as Cuban 
mothers, who watch silently as their 
sons march 01T to die in the jungles of 
Africa to help unpopular regimes 
slaughter their people? Sixty thousand 
Cubans in Africa. 15.000 of them in 
Angola and another 20.000 in Ethiopa 
serve as cannon fodder for the 
mailllenance of the Soviet empire. I am 
not defending EI Salvadoran righl-~ing 
death squads. I am saying the people of 
EI Salvador will gain nothing if they do 
as was done in Cuba and Nicar.tgua. 

CAN \QJ BUY GOOD TASTE? 
Yes! Now you can acquire good taste for a 
couple of bucks. Just wear shirts and visors 
that say "Dos EQuis." After all, those 
ate foreign words, And anyone in college 
knows people who wear stuff with foreign 

words and alligators have good taste. 
So, order your kind of good taste in Dos 

EQuis sportswear today. And remember to 
eat your peanut butter and jelly sand-
wiches over the sink, 

wherr a group of dictators on the right 
is ~placed by a woup of dictators on 
the left. Brutality and opprrssion is rhr

I could go on detailing Soviet

Rallying against 
car rallies ' 
By LINDA HOWARD 

Students damor for more activities. 
tudying 18 hours a day can be bonng 

One of the more popular pastimes was 
jumping in a car spontaneously and 
going for a Spin around the 
neighborhood. Now we organize driving. 
We call it a 'car rally. 

Cav aUies have been popular since 
cars were Invented. The UCSD Ski Club 
has one every year. with the grand prize 
being a ticket to the AII·Cal ski trip. On 
October 23, Warren College challenged 
ReveUe College to a rally. with "all the 
pizza you could eat afterwards." Five 
carloads of students turned out- for the 
event. driving the course of sixty miles. 
What was the motivation? According to 
the organizer at the Warren dean's 
office. the purposes were "to get people 
to see San Diego. have fun. meet new 
people: one of the many activities to get 
commuters together." 

What was the expense of this car 
rally? Besides the $4 entry ;ee and the 
price of gas, the obvious costs. other 
expenses were mvolved. Using 
California averages. the five cars on 
October 23 used 19 gallons of gas. and 
produced 14.010 grams of carbon 
monoxide. 1068 grams of hydrocarbons 
and 1143 grams of nitrogen oxides. 
These amounts <lre only a miniscule 
dent on the remaining oil reserves and 

the pollullon entering the air. Wh<lt 
difference can this little amount make? 

During the third week of the faU 
quaner. anta Ana conditions pushed 
an Diego to a smog alen . Students 

complamed about feeling ill from 
breathi ng the polluted air. In the 70s. 
gas shonages were common. People 
learned to cut back unnecessary driving. 
Two weeks after the smog blew away. 
and several years after gas lines. two 
UCSD colleges sponsored a car rally. 

We quickly forget that problems still 
exist when their symptoms give us a 
respite. To prevent smog conditions like 
our recent one. and to slow the 
depletion of a non-renewable resource. 
oil . people must drive conservatively. 
Temporary cutbacks when the 
conditions are dire will not solve the 
problem. and neither will the effons of a 
small ponion of society. like students. 
yet their actions suggest an apathy 
toward the future of our society. We 
should take the first step toward 
conservation of precious substances by 
altering our own lifestyles to create a 
sustainable society. The eradication of 
car rallies and wasteful driving from our 
personal lives is by no means a solution , 
but it is an exercise in conservation 
practices, a ~ow of concern for a 
healthy environment.

Fonner SecretaI)' of Defense 
Shatters 'Window of Vulnerability" 

experien~c and comments made by Robert Scheer. Los 
A'lgdes Times national reponer and UC Regents 
lecturer. In his book Wllh Enough Show/s: Reagan, Bush 
lind Nudt'ur War , Scheer reveals the reason for 
McNamara's special understanding of the military 
versus political realities. "In 1960, Kennedy scored a 
heavy victory with hiS accusation that the Republicans 
had left open a missile gap berween us and the 
Soviets. Once he was elected and read the intelligence 
data (presented by his Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara). he discovered tllat the Soviets had only a 
few missiles compared to our thousand. But no maner. 
By the time he discovered the error, he was President. By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

I C a person in me 60s had said Raben McNamara. architect oC me Viernam War and the US Nuclear build-up. would be lecturing in the 80s in 
opposition [0 prescnt US Nuclear War strategies, mat 
person would have been accused oC living in a fantasy 
separate Crom the real world. 

At Monday's Faculty Seminar on International 
Security, sponso~ by the UC Institute or. Global 

'. ", 

"fl·····!

Connict and Cooperation. Robert McNamara stated , 
-There is a difference between the military's real world 
nuclear arms reality of the past thiny years and the 
political reality of the Reagan administration. which 
has contrived the "Window of Vulnerability." that 
cannot be closed by the MX missile, because it does 
not exist." 

McNamara's statement is derived from personal 

-So. too, the window of vulnerability became a 
successful election ploy for Reagan and the other 
Republican candidates who succeedtd in scaring 
voters into believing that our country's strategiC posture 
had been seriously damaged by Caner's policies of ~ 
·disarmament.' 

-But the analogy with Kennedy ends here, for 
Reagan became addicted to his campaign rhetoric and 
as President continued to invoke the window oC 
vulnerability to justify his massive arms build-up lof 
Pershing (( and Cruise Missilesl in Western Europe." 

From that sober learning experience, McNamara 
now asserts , -Nuclear weapons serve no military 
purpose whatsoever. They are totally useless - except 
only to deter one's opponent from using them." 

McNamara's lecture to the UCSD faculty and such 
guests as former Governor Jerry Brown and Freimut 
Duve (Social Democratic Pany member of the German 
Bundestag), clarified the difference between military 
and poli.tical reality. 

-The public. on both sides of the Atlantic. is 
engaged in debate on controversial questions relating 
to nuclear weapons: the deSirability of a nuclear freeze; 
the deployment of Pershing II and Cruise missiles to 
Western Europe; the production uf the MX missile; 
and proposals 10 reduce the risk of nuclear war by 
such measures as the withdrawal of tactical nuclear 
weapons from forward areas and the declaration of a 
strategy of 'no launch warning.' . 

"These questions, however, cannot be thoughtfully 
discussed. and cenainly not adequately answered , until 
mere has been general agreement on the military role 
of nuclear weapons. If there is confusion in the public 
mind on this malter. it only mirrors the disagreement 
among those most familiar with such weapons and 
their implications .... 

-Field Marshall Lord Carver. chief of the British 
Defence Staff; General Johannes Steinhoff. former chief 
of staff of the Federal German Air Force; (ormer 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. and Admiral Nod -
Gayler, former commander in chief of US forces in the 
Pacific. suppons the fact that nuclear weapons are 
useless militarily.

And in the same ~in , IOrmer Sec~tary

that it is unlikdy.nuclar war could be

policy of no first u~ would ~ a 
threat which <kttrs Soviet aggn:ssion 
and , dttrefon: , would inc~ thc 
danger of war.' 

"Whether the developing of NATO 
nuclear forces is justified had become 
qucsrionabic to many by the early 60s. 
Soon aftcr taking office in 1961 , thc 
Kennedy Adminisrration began a 
detailed analysis of the policy's ~ngths

wtapons, it permir~ a subsrantial

co~ntional forces alone. 

"BI.B Ocxible ~spon~ could only'MXk

overwhelming nuclear advan. over

and Crui~ Missilesl against the Soviet 
homeland would lead abnost certainly to 
a rt>sponse in kind which would innict 
unacceptable damage on Europe and 
the Uni~ Stares - it would be an act 
of suicide. 

-The thn:ar of such an action. 
thert>f~ , has lost aI c~ibility as a 

deterrent to Soviet conventional 
aggression. The ultimate sanction in the 
flexible ~spon~ srl'3tegy is thus no 
longer operative. One cannot build a 
credible detern:nt on an inc~ible 
action. Yet the Rtagan AdminiSlration

responding to an invasion of Western 
Europe, and since the artillery has a 
short range, 10 miles, the nuclear 
explosions would occur on NATO's own 
territory. If a subsrantial portion of the 
nuclcar artillery shens wt~ fi~ , not 
only would the invasion force hkcly .-
suffer heavy casuakies among its military 
personnel , but large numbers of NATO's 
civilian and military perionnel also 
would likely be killed and injured. Then: 
also would be considerable damage to 
proptny, farmland and urbanizrd areas.

announcement that it intends to meet 
Soviet convmlional ~ssion with

"Having spent ~~n years IS

that the peace movement has not

years. Only recently has arms control

"How 'bout them Harshers?" One can hear the question repeated over and over on 
any Sunday morning, but the ones who are doing the asking are the Harshers 
themselves. To them everythingls harsh: "harsh block, Ted," "harsh catch, Goose," 
"harsh call, ref," and·so on. Last Sunday, the Harshers, who had built upa3·0 record 
and a plus·77 point differential , played a harsh game against the Grassholes. For 1917 
minutes t here was no score, and it looked like the Grassholes were getting the best of 
the Harshers. But with time running out in the first half Robertson threw 40 yards and 
through t he hands of two Grasshole defenders to Sillman in t he end· zone for six. The 
Harshers got their offense going in the second half, scoring twice for a final score of 19· 
O. "Things weren't going our way at first," explained Regale, "but then we started 
harshing." 

The Harshers have good athletes at each position, but it's the Sillman·Hoffman 
receiving duo which gives them the edge over other single A teams. They like to 
compare themselves to the old Oakland Raiders, with the swift Hoffman as Cliff 
Branch and the crafty Sillman as Fred Bilitnekof. 

How long do the Harshers plan to be around in this year's battle for the single A 
championsnip? Mike Delbick has the answer: "As long as there are cold Mi!lers after 
the game, we'll keep harshing."

UCSD triathletes comp-ete in Hawaii 

Ironmen sweat it out in paradise 
By JEFF SAVAGE 

W e have mel the ul[imale chaUenge in the world of sport, and it appears more as a suicidal attempt than a race. The 
Triathlon is the combinalion of three evems: swimming. 
cycling and running. The total dIstance for these three 
events ranges anywhere from 20 to 140 miles. A 20 
mile tvent. though a struggle for the novice, is nothing 
more than a tune-up for the dedicattd triathlete. On 
the other hand. a 140 mile race is the supreme test for 
the experienced and just a dream for the beginner. 

Though there are several 140 mile races on the 
triathlon circuit. there is one race that stands above all 
the rest, just as the Super Bowl stands above any other 
football game. II's the HawaIi lronman World Triathlon. 
and any emram WIth knowledge of the hazards of the 
race is either a hard-core triathlete or a member of 
athletics' lunatic fnnge. Running alongside a volcano 
with one hundred degree heat reflecting off hot lava 
fields strams the individual's limits like the ancient 
rights of passage. Pedaling a bicycle for hours into the 
teeth of a wi nd so strong that the greatest speed 
attained is a walking pace reaches the outer limits of 
masochism. 

Surely all 987 entrants for this year's Hawaii lronman 
World Triathlon on October 22nd were aware of the 
hazards. What then drove them to endure the pain? 
Yokio Mishima. a Japane¥ novelist. once !\;lid. "The 
only way to reaDy know mal you're alive is to come as 

.... . -" ~.-

close as you. can to death ." Perhaps a bit extreme in 
the case of a triathlete's goal. but the race is a test 
nonelheless. The triathlon is merely a replacemem for 
other tests of bravery that have faded with time. All the 
mountains have been climbed. All the seas have been 
swum . War and chivalry have become insults. Even 
astronauts are no longer heroes but simply scientists. A 
jock used to be a sacred being, but in taday's society 
everyone is an alhlete. These beings are not alhletes. 
They are trial~letes . 

For Erik Schmidt, Scott Katzman and Colin Brown. 
this year's 1ronman' Triathlon was a Wrturous pleasure. 
Katzman ran in his first triathlon and placed 169th. 

Of the race he sa-id. "I felt like crying. I was in so 
much pain ." Brown finished in ten hours and 35 
minutes to place 26th. "After getting ofT the bike and 
starting the marathon run I felt my body start to give 
way. I thought. 'uh oh. here goes.' I self destructed." 
Schmidt crossed the finish line just six minutes after 
Brown to finish 30th in the race . ·During the run I felt 
like quitting most of the way. At one point I got dizzy 
and staned to shiver and had to walk part of the way 
to an aid station." Considering this was Katzman's first 
triathlon to compete in , placing in the top 20% of the 
most experienced assemblage of triathletes is quite an 
achievement. even more so considering he must 
devote part of his energies to school. Katzman is a full -

time student at UCSD. 
Schmidt and Brown are more experienced. Both are 

sponsored by Team Yosemite and both have run in 
over ten tnathlons thIS year (though nothing compared 
to the Ironman Triathlon). But placing 26th and 30th 
in a field of nearly one thousand is miraculous 
considering neilher can spend their time solely on 
training for these events. They too are UCSD students. 

Describing the Iron man Triathlon particirants as 
merely experienced is not enough. Many 0 them are 
driven at a frightening level of devotion to reach the 
rarest extreme of physical endurance. Preparation and 
self-motivation are obviously the main ,ingredients for 
success. Ex-triathlete champion Duncan Thomas 
pedals 15 miles on weekdays and 50 to 60 miles on 
weekends. He also swims one mile and several 100 
yard interv-als every day and follows this with a ten 
mile run . Advice from one experienced [riathlete is. 
"Ride or run direcdy into the strongest afternoon 
winds. especially when you are tired! Try swimming in 
the roughest conditions your local lakes or ocean can 
offer." Just how great can self-motivation be? 

The race began on a relatively mild note . as the 
competitors only had to brave 78 degree ocean water 
for the first leg of the race. After an hour. the 10th 
fastest sWImmer in the world emerged first out of the 
water. Colin Brown was only a few moments behind .

ALBERTO GOMEZ 
Men's soccer 

In the most important game of tbe season,last Friday,the men's soccer team scored 
two goals against powerhouse Colorado CoIlrge. for most teams, two goals translates 
into at beSt a tit, but for UCSD this year, two scores haw consistentIyequaRed victory 
as they did this time in a 2-0 win. The reason is second-year goalie Albeno Gomez. 
While the squad is enjoying perhaps their finest season ever, Gomez is enjoying a 
stellar year between the posts. In UCSD's 19 games this season, Gomez has recorded 
11 shutouts and has allowed only nint goals al year, statistics definitely wonhy of All-
American honors. Against 'Colorado College, the junior from Coral Gablrs, Florida, 
made four one-on-one saves. As the season winds down , the Tritons are 13-2-4 and 
are anticipating a regional bid for tht NCAA Division III championship.

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE & MIKE GREENBERG 
WHA!'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Although both were defeated last Sunday, the San 
FrancISCO 4gers and Los Angeles Raiders will meet in this year's Super Bowl. Tom 
Flores' Raiders are clearly the class the AfC, in, what has been a very wc:llk )'ear for the 
conference. Only Miami , with the exciting Dan Marino at quanerback. can be an 
obstacle . in Los Angeles' Super Bowl fath. Even that docs not seem likel)'. Now Ihat 
Marc ~llson has established himsel as the Raiders' number one quanemack. Los 
Angeles lone naw has been eliminated. Against a superb running game, an above-
average aerial attack and the league's toughest defense, no (me will stop the silver and 
black from reaching Tampa Bay in Jomuary. As for the 4!krs, they do have more holes 
than other NFC clubs, but not in the skilled pOSitions. Coach Bill Walsh continues to 
be rhe ga~e's best off-the-field im~ro~i.sor, Structuring his learn's game plan around the 
opponents weaknesses, and there Isn t a belter on-me-field improvisor than 
quanerbackJoe Montana. If San Francisco can avoid serious injuries to some of their 
AU-Pros, they will rendezvous with l.A .. and the Bily Area will be treated to its most 
enjoyable Super Bowl ever, as there are still quite ,I few Raider followers. and now, as a 
result of the team's move to the Southland, qUite a few Raider haters. 

NOT TO BE IEUEVED DEPT. Who says that (he NCAA is ' cleaning up its act? How 
is it that IOnner Oklahoma Sooner great Marcus Dupree can enroll at Southern . 
Mississippi in the seventh week of the quarter, just two weeks after withdrawing from 
Oklahoma due (0 philosophical differences with head coach Barry Switzer? Isn't there 
some enrollment process at that school? Or can a student (after all, that is what Marcus 
is supposed to be) just jump from one school to another in a twO week time span 
without meeting academic requirements? What about aU the prospective students with 
superior acadtmic qualifications who were denied acceptance? Why does Dupree's 
accepunce rake precedence over theirs? What school would aDow a stucknt transfer in 
the seventh week of a quaner, having most likely missed numerous tests and 
mldrrrms7 just because they havc acquired a supreme talent like Dupree is no 
justification for Southern Mississippi to give the swift haltback a free ride through 
school. With aU the notoriety that Southern Mississippi will receive over Dupltt, we 
have 10 think that the public:s perception of the school has declined as a result of this 

inl=id~l1l .. {ksides, the odds on Dl4prce waiting until 1985 whtn he becomes c1iple, tQ., 
ptrform in college is doubtful, especlaDy with multimlDion dollar contract alTers by the 
USFl and the Canadian roc.baD lngue. 
WAIT A MINUTE, It has been widely accepted that San Diego Charger quanerback 
Dan Fouts is one of the premier passers in footbaO today. Some say he is indeed the 
bei>t the NFL has to offer, and a few even claim that Fouts is perhaps the finest 
quanerback to ever play the game. Although the latter statement is a bit exaggerated, 
we have changed our thinking on fouts' abiliry and now agree that he is in fact one of 
the three top quarterbacks in the league. The adage that absence makes the hean grow 
fonder has captured us in the case of the missing FOUlS. Although the AU-Pro from 
Oregon has set sewn NFL and 22 club records in his eleven year career, determined 
doubters (as wt were) could claim that anything with more mobility than the Sta~ of 
Libeny can rack up great statistics when protected by the superb Cha .... offensive 
lint, having a great core of receivers to throw to and operating under Air CoryeU's 
system. Records such as 35 3OO-yard games In his career, which is tops in NFL 
history, and four straight 300-yard games three different times (which is second to San 
Francisco's Joe Montana) seem a cinch with these assets. But apparently not so. With 
Fouts sidelined the last two weeks with a rotator culT injury, understudy Ed Luther, 
who is nothing shon of average, has been unable to ~ve the Charger o~nse 
effectively. Sure, he directed two touchdown dnves in the final eight minutes of the 
Washington game Monday night, but the Redskin secondary is horrendous, and they 
were playing well off the Charger receivers to protect a big lead anyway. Besides that 
eight minute burst. the Charger offensive machine has sputtered the other seven and a 
half quaners, and Luther has tired nine interceptions. It got so embarraSSing Monday 
night that when Redskin linebacker Neal Olkewicz picked off a Luther pass (the QB's 
fifth interccption of the game) in the third quaner, ABC had this exchange. Don 
Meredith: "Well, Olkewicz was wide open: Frank Gifford: "He made a good move. 
didn't he." Meredith: "He's been staying after practice all week to work Lln that 
pattern: The ABC announcers felt compelled to make light of Luther's mistake because 
II had reached the humiliation stage. The point is , Fouts is far more valuable than we 
had given him credit for. 
NEXT QUESTION PlEASE DEPT, Monda)"s question: Prior to the Philadelphia 
76ers, which \\""S the last NBA ream to sweep all four games of the championship 
series? Answer: the Golden Starr Warriors in 1975. Toda)"s questi~lO : UCSD has

THERE'S NO WAY IT COUlD BE DEPT, Once a week, UCSD students are treated

an extensivc writc-up on teilm performances. the Budman (whose identity has been 
uncovered b)' the Gillin/kill but shidl nm be revealt:d) lists the "1M FOllmal1 Ratings" tor 
each ~ague . It is assumed by allthar these r.mkings are accur.lle. Don't be fooled . An

Butt Start (number one nmked in M football) imd Ridgemont (number ~lI'I in A

Triathlon 
continued from II 
Following the 2.4 mile swim came a 
grueling test of endurance - a 1 J 2 mile 
bike ride. Nor your typical sunday 
pleasure trip. Pan of the COUBe runs 
along the Kona hills where steady winds 
prevail, bur with a hurricane passing 
through Hawaii on the same weekend 
as the race, the IHty mile an hour 
headwinds were vinuaUy unbearable. 
Aid stations with food , drinks. and 
sponges were set up every five miles, 
but as Erik Schmidt explains, they were 
of little use. 

"Biking uses a lot of energy, but 

Colill Browll 

heading into the wind at a lOp speed of 
two miles an hour was reaDy draining. 
But when you finaly gOl to a station you 
couldn't get any aid, because if you took 
either hand olf the handle bar you'd get 
blown olf your bike: 

For most the true (est of the race was 
(he 26 mile run, but Katzman IS.a 
maralhon runner, and in fact he 
qualified for the BoslOn Marathon earlier 
In the year. "Although I qualified , I 
didn't want to run in it because I didn't 
want 10 lose 10 a girl." Katzman, Brown 
and Schmidt all agree that the IIrS[ few 

Erill Srhmidt 

miles of the run were extremely dilficuh 
because of the adjustment from the bike 
to the ground . "The run was mentaDy 
very difficult." says Schmidt. "I wanted 
to qUit most of the way." 

Of the 987 enmmts, J 20 lailed to 
finish . Thirty-year-old Dave Scou from 
Davis. California posted a winning time 
of nine hours and five minute!'.. Twenty-
five-year-old Mark Allen. who attended 
UCSD and was a member of the men's 
swim ti;lm, finished third . Even (he 
Human Fly. who once climbed the Sears 

tIlwcr \~'ith SUCtion cups and ""IS pulled 
dO\\T1 from the 87th l1oor, tested his 
limits in the rdce.

BooksaJes are back 
By ROBfRT lLortf 

1bose of you who were at this campus last )ar may remember the 
weekly book sales that took place in the Love Man alcoYt in Central 
Ubrary. We remember the 2!H hardbacks. the 1(K paperbacks. or, 
when they weren't cleaning out the stock, the 5(K hardcovers and 2!H 
paperbacks. We also probably remember the small blonde in the 
blazer with the huge canvas Bryn Mawr bag. suitable for stowing away

Well, this festlvaJ of blbIlophllla will be recreated when the friends 
of the UCSD Ubrary hold the first sale of the academic )'ar l'rkIay. 
rtovember 11 In the main lobby of Central Ubrary from noon to 2 pm. 

According to .... Iyn Wilson. a member of the 1'rtaIds, this book 
sale will allow the rriends to put together a better selection of books 
to sell with better quality. and (unfortunately) hJgher prices. Another 
feature of these quarterly sales Is that the books will be Individually 
priced. rio more 2!H for everything. 

One of the big questions that occurs to people who attend these 
sales is where do these books come from. Apparently, the books are 
donated to the University. UCSD librarians take the books they want 
and then turn over the remainder to the I'rlends of the UCSD Ubrary, 
who then sell the books so that other more needed books can be 
purchased tt. the libraries. . 

One book whkh you may be lucky enough to find at the sale, 
although you are certain to tlnd It In Cluster Ubrary (If someone hasn't

Admittedly, James Branch cabell has the same effect. but his novels

Alan Schneider. head of 
UCSO's Oraduate Directing 
Program, is a whirlwind 01 
energy. With his twinkling e)'U 
and boyiIh grin. Scltnelder 
radiates a dynamic zest for 
theatre and a love for 11ft. 

When asked to delcrlbe his 
culftllt productJcn, Scltnelder 
chuckles heartily, "How much 
time do I have'l''' 

Perpetually on the go, 
SchneIder is involved in .. 
endlest list of prqIects. Having 
just returned froIIl new York. 
where he mounted, to critical 
acclaim, tIIree Sllnuel Beckett 
plays at tile Harold Cunun 
TheatR, Schneider is praently 
directing the flnt show 01 the 
UCSD 'I1Ieatre IP.IIOIl, 1hornton 
WIlder's OIIrToall. Opening rite 
Wlr lit IIome on Broadway in 
Dec:aIIbu, ScIuIeIder II also 
plannIDg to do PIeces of lltIht 
with John HouseInIn's ActIng 
Company and thRe new Harold 
Filter plays at the Manhattan 
Theatre Club this spring. In his 

spa~ time, Schneider Is busy 
writing his book of memoirs. 

Although he modestly 
describes himself as "a plain. 
ordinary, hard·worklng 
director:' Schneider 15 a 

. dmtor's director. In his 45 
yms of~ng In probsional 
theater, Sc:ImeIder has directed 
over lOO procluctioDs on 
Broadway, off Broadway, and In 
~gIonal tlteltra In this c:ounby 
and abroIIcI. 

A foremost director of 
modan, experimental worU. 
Schneider has staged the 
"'-lean productions of all of 
Samuel Beckett's plays as well 
• many plays by Harold Flnter, 

~nI Albee, and Plkhael 
Weller. 

Schneider bas been 
nominated for the Tony ..... 

I five times. In 196.5 he became 
the iMlly dlm:tor to haft ever 
received both the Tony IlleS Oble 
Awalds In the same year. 
Scbneider's 1971 production of 
OUr Town at the Arena Stage hi 
Wublngton. D.C. became the 
lint AmerIcan dramatic play to 
tour the Soviet Union. 

A former artistic dlm:tor of 
Jobn Houseman's Acting 
Company, Schneider has also 
taugltt theatre at Catholic 
UnlYerSIty I'or 12 yars and at 

A director's director 
Bolton University for 20 years. 
IIdcIre . comtng to UCSD in the 
1111 011979, Schndderserved&l 
director 01 new York City's 
Juillanl TheatR Center. 

110m II Russia, Sc:hnGcIer's 
love ofthatre Wl5sparked at an 
early age. "When I IllS very 
JOUII9, two or thrft years old. 
my motlter used to leave me 
nery Saturday afternoon at the 
Ploscow State Children's 
1'IIeaIR. It was kind of a 
babpltter. It must have 
stimulated my curiosity, my 
lmaginatton, my sense of 
alCMnbnalt. It never occlU1'ed 
to .. tllat I would be In the 
theatre, but I began to love the 
theatrt, the magic of the 
transformation of make-
believe." 

ror Schneider, obaervatlon 
led to participation. "People ask 

., JQM rOMllEIICi 
me 'How long have you been 
dlrecthtg?'" Schneider laughs. 
". reply 'eva since • was four 
years old In the backyard with 
sheets and pll.' • . • I was 
directing long before I knew 
what directing was or how to do 
It" 

However, a career la the 
theatre was newer planned. 
Schneider studied journalism 
and political science at the 
UnJvaslty of \Vtsc.oMln. "I 
wanted to be a news,..,ennan. I 
rally wanted to be a fCl'elgn 
c:onapondent In the war with a 
doubIe-breuted trenc:hcoat and 
all." 

But the theatre bug bit 
f.aming a ma!ler's dqp'ee In 
dramatic literature from Cornell 
UnJvasIty, Schneider wason his 
way straight to the top. 

Schneider has had an 

eminently successful and 
unusual dlm:tlng career. In his 
early ~ he staged the 
classics of Shakespeare. 
PIoUere, Chekhov, Sophocles. 
and Racine. Recently Schneider 
his eqIoyed working 011 "nutty 
plays that nobody undentands . 
•. play.s In which two and two 
doesn't equal four." 

His Interest In these 
contemporary plays has led to 
his working relationships and 
personal friendships with some 
of this century's most 
prominent playwrights. 
including Beckett. Pinter. 
AIbu. Weller, and the lat£ 
Thornton Wilder. 

"I love working with a living 
playwrlgltt as part of an organk 
process." Schneider explains. 
"The play is new. It has never 
been done before. You are 

A_ Schneider: "ffJljDb with M«IM Ls to stimulate 111m or Iter I" some .,., to wort .t tht highest lelld •.. 

discovering It evolving It. 
shaping It You are a part of it ... 
I think of myself as a dilUtor 
serving the playwright's 
Intention." 

Unlike many directors who 
concentrate only 011 their own 
careers, Schneider feels 
personal satisfaction In sIIarIng 
his years of experience and 
e~ with young dlra:tJng 
students. He strives to help 
them develop their talents. and 
he e1:: following their 
profess I .,.th. 

"Plost people don·t 
understand that I have always 
been a teaclter." Scllnelder says. 
". have always had one foot In 
the academk camp and one In 
the proff:ssional world. I think it 
Is good for working profasfon-
lis to share their experience 
with younger people •••• When I 
was very young and wanted to 
be a dJm:tor. I found that the 
IIlCIIt dlftlcult thing of all was to 
get to learn from other 
directors. I SIIOre a vow of some 
kind to myself that if I ever 
achieved anything I would try to 
pass It on. I haW! been doing 
that all my life." 

Valuing their talents and 
ideas. Schneider treats his 
graduate acting and dIrecting 
students as professionals. "Ply 
job with an actor (student 0.: 
professtonal) is to stlmulat£ 
him CI' her In some way to work 
at the highest level that he or 
she can work." 

Directing the UCSD 
production of Thornton Wilda's 
Our Town (openJng !"Iovembel' 
10) has great personal 
slgnlncance to Schneider. 
Wilder's powerful message In 
this play epitomizes Schneldei"s 
philosophy of life. 

"OUr Town is not about a 
IItUe village In new lngland. It 
Is about living. the value. of life. 
It deals with the eternal verities 
of human life - love. marriage, 
and death - In all socleUes at 
all Umes. That's what makes It 
so wonderful:' 

Like Wilder. Schneider 
believes that every moment of 
life. whether joyous or painful. 
should be cherished. "Ute Is 
mnstantly changing. Wilder's 
lnemge Is: ·Don·t waste your 
lives. ~ is more to life than 
walkJng In the surf,'''

Robert Powell's 
new book is a 
wake-up call 

By CHRISTOPHEK CAI'f~ 
'ftIe aIann soQllded. A slumbering 

world began showing signs of 
1IIOWement. We were being aWlkaled to 
the dawning or tile Age or AqUll'ius. 
Uke the penon who waka just before 
the alarm clock rings. Robert Powell 
wrote his lint book, zen .Itd RaIl". 
which was publlsIIed lor the e.rtyrfsers 
In 1981. 

PORII cultivated his concept or 
eallgbteJuneat (awakening) U I 
bloaomlng and fruition of In 
IndIridual', ortgtIIIIllbft. To Powell, 
guru, Iedarlan groups, .. how-to-
medlt.tk books were IIIeI'fJy c:ltalylts 
or fatUI .... for pmonal gmwth. 

hi the )'tII'S that fbllowed, rowetl 
watched the Age or Aquarius ~ 
watmd down as people trted to 
become aware or too many things: the 
Yleblam war, envtroruneJal pollution, 
lItecllt.ttfon, worldwide SilarYltlon, 
mbId-apandlng drugs. _ love, etc. 

Uk the IInner who trta to raise 
crops to feed the entire world, 
Indlvlcluals becaIne overConunlttecl. 
TIley forgot to DOUrtsII thanselves and 
stttugthn tbelr Inner beings. I'eeUng 
exhlusted from the constant 
commitment. people. began to 
withdraw for sbort rats IIICI eYelltUIl1y 
returned to a deep sleep. WdlllA. 

ThoUgh Powell calls his book TIle 
QlUt Awakening, he 19a1n makes it 
vtr'J clear that this awakening Is purely 
a pel~1 endeavor. The time Is set by 
ounelva not by Idf-orda.lnecl gurus or 
mass psychological or sectariaD 
encounter groups. . 

Most ~ wntteD on the subject of 
enllglltenmmt are so sectarian that 
they faU to give the general reader an 
overview or personal awakening. 
Powell does not restrict his reflections 
and commentaries to just one form of 
awakening. He re\U1s the essential 
similarities among all groups: 
Buudhlst. Hindu. Christian, Zen. taoist. 
and followers of Krlshnamurtl. He deals 
with human beings and the way we 
function: how we are, not how we 
fantasize ourselves to be. 

Powell explains that our dally mind 
Is nlled with continual random 
background thoughts: the latest rock 
songs. worries about grades and 
money. and whether anyone cares 
about who we a~. Powell sees 
enlightenment asa state ormlnd where 
thought becomes purely functional, 
like a tool, a tool that would spring Into 
action when needed. the way most 
people function. their thoughts spring 
Into action whether needed or not. 

We have no freedom because or this 
continuous pressure or random 
thought. fven the Intellectual. the 
college student. Is not free from this 
process. ror his or her thoughts are 
more complex and command more 
attention. What develops 15 a selr-
perpetuating process. The 
superstructure of thought becomes so 
commonplace that we don't recognlzt 
Its spider webbing of our minds. 

People always want to make an effort 
or their dally actions and thoughts. 
They think Ir they stop ror a moment 
they will die. The very opposite 15 the 
case. Once a person stops making an 
effort. that Is, a psychological effort In 
the sense or worrying about doing 
something rather than the effort orjust 
doln~ it. an awakenln~ occurs. 

Powell sees our lives as already too 
tilled with desires ror new skills. 
possessions, and fads. One needs to see 
these obsessions as rantasies and 
dreams. which hold our minds In a 
sleeping state. To realize we are 
dreaming anticipates our alann about 
to sound ror our great awakening.
