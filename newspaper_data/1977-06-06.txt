While 400 people listened to speakers on Reuelle plaza FrIday, UCSD 
plain ·clothes officer Joe Thornell was taking pictures of the crowd with a 
Kodak instamatic. At the chancellor's complex, where the rally against 
UC inuestments in South Africa culminated, Thornell was joined In 
picture taking by another plain clothes officer. 

Whe.n he was asked why the pictures were taken , campus police chief 
Ill/gh french. who was also at the rally. said, "Just in case." 

Approximately 11 campus police officers were present at the chan · 
cellors complex. They were augmented by the presence of seueral 
adn,inistrators who mingled with the crowd. 

Outside Rally Rages ; 
Inside They Wait, Talk 

by Alan Russell 
News Edltor 

Chancellor William McElroy spoke softly, his voice barely rising over 
the railing speeches, many of them directed at him, going on to the west 
of his office. 

"I thought it was a very peaceful and appropriate demonstration," he 
said, referring to the approximately 250 students who circled the Chan-
cellor's complex several times chanting slogans against UC investment 
and American dealings in South Africa. 

"Students have good points in regard to the South African issue, and I 
thought it (the rally) was an effective means of bringing them forth 
before the public," he said. "They weren't destructive, which I consider a 
very positive thing, as destructive demonstrations often get the public 
against those involved." 

Inside the Chancellor's office, an atmosphere of controlled tenseness 
pervaded, high administrators, a secretary. and campus policemen just 
"waiting." McElroy, tucked away in his office, detailed what had gone on 
in his talk with a group of four people representing the demonstrators, 
and further gave his impressions of the entire affair. 

"We only talked for about ten minutes, but I told the group I didn't think 
I had any fundamental disagreements with the demonstrators except on 
one point: time. 

Would Cause Unemployment 
"I'm not an investment counselpr, but I can tell you that if in this 

country we pushed and succeeded in immediate selling of all South 
Mrican stock, it would mean bad unemployment in the US. 

"By making all the different corporations sell their stock in South 
Mrica, you would probably force them into laying off a lot of people here 
at home. Additionally, there are those people in this country who have 
their money invested-small investors who have all their money tied into 
the companies-and they're the ones who would suffer." 

McElroy emphasized his "sympathy" with the students, but stressed

Regents Write to Corporations 
by Alec Nedelman 

Associate News Editor 
While UCSD students marched to 

protest UC investments in apar-
theid South Africa Friday, the UC 
Regents were sending a letter to 37 
corporations in which the 

Erratum 
In the letter to the editor by 

Ralph Grunewald on June 2 
entitled " YSA Tells 'Big Lie' 
About Israel," part of ttie line 
was inadvertently left out. It 
should have read, "No single 
Jewish organization engaged in 
such despicable activities. On the 
contrary, organizations .... were 
instrumental in finding homes 
and jobs for the oppressed Jewish 
refugees of EI1I'Ope. 

1lle Triton Times regrets this 
error. 

lUliversity is a stockholder asking 
the corporations to outline their 
business holdings in South Africa. 

The Regents' letter also 
requested those companies with 
ties to the racially split nation to 
identify the extent to which they 
would be willing to wok'k to end the 
segregation and the unfair and 
discriminatory employment 
practices of their South Africa 
companies. 

The ,letter does not state nor 
imply, however, that the Regents 
will divest themselves from those 
corporations with South African 
interests who are doing nothing to 
end racial discrimination in their 
facilities. Regent Chairman 
William K. Coblentz indicated 
willingness "to divest ourselves of 
our stock" lf the university's letter 
identifies corporations unwilling to 
change their discriminatory 
practices is tempered by the 
knowledge that Coblentz is a 
liberal on a predominataly 
moderate to conservative board.

UC Holdings Hit at Rally 
Students Demand Sale of S. African Stock 

by Mark Stadler 
Managing editor 

Three-hundred and fifty people 
held a rally at Revelle plaza and 
marched to the chancellor's 
complex Friday to protest the 
University of California's in-
vestments in corporations active in 
South Africa. 

The demonstration was held in 
conjunction with protest actions 
staged at UC Berkeley and UC 
SantaCruz. 

In contrast to similar demon-
strations held recently at 
California college campuses, 
where over 700 students were 
arrested, the rally here was 
peaceful. While as many as 10 
campus police officers were 
present at the Chancellor 
McElroy's office, no incidents 
occurred. 

Continue Picketing 
The demonstrators plan to 

continue a small picket line at 
McElroy's office all this week, with 
another rally scheduled for 
Wednesday at noon on Revelle 
plaza. 

All the recent demonstrations-
including one at last month's 
Board of Regents meeting (Triton 
Times, May 23)-have been in 
protest of the Regents ' $300-million 
South African investment which. 

some say, helps perpetuate South 
Africa 's white supremist gov-
ernment. 

The UCSD demonstration 
started with a series of speeches on 
Revelle plaza. Literature graduate 
student Emily Hicks read a list of 
demands formulated by the 
coalition of over 20 campus groups 
which sponsored the rally. 

The demands include that UC 
divest itself of investments in 
South African interests, that the 
students arrested at the other 
rallies be released without further 
administrative reprisal and that 
the university more strongly 
condemn the Bakke decision on UC 
admissions policies. 

Hicks also read a statement from 
UC President Saxon, who said the 
university has sent letters to 37 
corporations dealing with South 
Africa and which the regents have 
invested in. Saxon said the letters 
ask the companies to adopt fair 
employment practices aimed at 
ending segregation in their South 
African plants. 

Ngubo is Featured 
The featured speaker at the rally 

was UCSD sociology professor 
Anthony Ngubo, a native South 
African. Ngubo said UC and other 
American corporations invest in 
South Africa because it provides 

them the best return on their in-
vestment dollar. 

The American government 
continues to support the South 
African government with money 
and technology because of that 
high investment return, Ngubo 
said. 

The sociology professor traced 
the reason for the high return to the 
South African social system of 
apartheid--or strict racial 
segregation of the nation's native 
black population-under which 
white workers are nonnally paid at 
least seven times as much as black 
workers for the same job. 

While American corporations 
say their 'investment dollars keep 
South African blacks employed, 
Ngubo said the money actually 
enables the white millOrity 
government "to strengthen its 
oppressive machinery, to get more 
equipment for the army and 
police. " 

Ngubo said the South African 
situation is the responsibility of 
Americans because many 
American leaders may soon urge 
the Marines be sent to protect 
American interests there . 

"I might see some of you in 
Johannesburg pointing an M-16 at 
my guts and you shouldn't be 
there. You should be on the side of 
liberation," Ngubo told the 
cheering crowd. 

" People's Forces Winning" 
Also speaking at the rally was 

the Rev. Al Dortch, who led a 
protest at the recent Davis Cup 
Match between the US and South 
Africa at Newport Beach. Dortch 
said that while " western powers 
have sought to rape Africa of its

Halt Shopping Center 
The San Diego City COWicillast Wednesday rejected North City West. a 

4300-acre housing development that would have been located northeast of 
UCSD on Interstate 5. The move was a wise one, the development would 
have been a blight on the north county, both environmentally and 
economically. 

Now two large developments remain planned for the area surrounding 
UCSD. One is the University Town Centre, a mammoth shopping center 
now under construction at the intersection ci La Jolla Village Dr. and 
Genessee Ave. The other is the May Co.-Donald Brei! Corp. proposal, 
which is still in the planning stages, set for the area between La Jolla 
Village Dr. and Gilman Dr. This project would contain a " specialty" 
center, a " convenience" center and a housing development. 

The " specialty" center could contain up to 50 stores, including a May 
Co. store and a Bullocks-Wilshire. The "convenience" center would 
consist of small shops, such as an ice cream parlour, a grocery store and 
a movie theatre. There would also be 400 condominiums, for sale at an 
average cost of approximately $70,000 apiece. 

The development was approved at a City Planning Conunission 
meeting in March, despite a planning department recommendation that 
it be rejected because it fails to meet standards set in the University 
Community Plan. The commission's approval has been appealed by a 
group of 70 La Jolla merchants and the La Jolla citizens planning group. 

While it is too late to stop UTC, there is still time to halt the " specialty" 
center. The City Council has scheduled a hearing on the development 
Wednesday at 2 pm, in the City Administration Building downtown. A 
negative vote by the coWicil would kill the project. 

San Diego does not need another regional shopping center. The uam 
community does not need one a t all. Students could use a convenience 
center with a few small , inexpensive c.\othing and food stores. They could 
also use some inexpensive housing near campus.

Letters to the Editor 
The Man in the Pink Bunny Suit 

The jester bas always been a 
necessary part of any ~n 
society. Down through the ages, 
when things have become too bad, 
a person has always been able to 
put on a mask or a clown outfit to 
speak the most vile insu)ts or utter 
Wlmiligated jibberish and thereby 
parody the truth so people could 
laugh in the midst of their miserY. 

UCSD, in this time of crisis, is no 
exception. Only the other day we 
learned that the Man in the Pink 
Bunny Suit has arrived to analyze 
our problems. Like the clowns and 

. jesters of yesterYear, he promises 
to serve the valuable sociological 
purpose ci identifying wrongs and 
monstrous adversities in such a 
satirical way that, if only for a 

brief moment, we will be able to 
abolish our problems by laughing 
at his antics. 

The Man in the Pink Bunny Suit 
says, for example, that TAl aren't 
critical to education at UCSO. 
Fortunately, our Chancellor knows 
better because his major financial 
advisory body, the Program 
Review Committee, has told him 
so. The PRC's Budget and 
Program Priorities Subcommittee 
sent him a letter dated April 15, 
1977, signed by chair Palll Salt-
man, saying that since the total 
allocation of TAs was so small, 
" some curtailment of programs, 
not just increased section sizes" 
would be necessary. The letter 
further requests our Chancellor to 

~r)il riel ~'1" ~w- ~ ~!"f., ~i "'~ 
j", ~arc..\., '",,,,,'ct Y'tve.lOfW!t~1 ~ "I.e.,Y ~&~ 

.,... bU;\~ .. ~~(.,a.-.i,a\ ~("~~ .. ~ ~dic.\"~ ,,· 
d w.c£hal1i<al .se~ea&lft ~d i~k~ ." ~ $¥I~(!h ••• 

make a "strong appeal" to the 
Systemwide AdmInIstration for 
our fair share of T As. 

The Man in the Pink Bunny Suit 
also says that there are no 
problems due to the lack of TAl. 
Fortunately, our Chancellor knows 
better, because the A~ademic 
Senate told him so. The Academic 
Senate 's Graduate Council, the 
faculty body which oversees 
graduate education, sent him a 
letter dated May 6, 1977, saying 
that the lack of T As has driven 
departments " to a number of 
strategies which adversely in-
fringe both on the graduate and 
undergraduate students. " 

The letter concludes that "the 
quality of undergraduate 
education will be affected" by 
insufficient numbers of TA's, and 
that "there is no reason for a 40: 1 
student-TA ratio on these cam-
puses (UCLA, Berkeley) while we 
have to make do with a ratio ci 
Sl : 1." 

The May Co.lDonald Bren proposal offers neither. Land costs could 
ve rY easily make even the convenience center stores expensive. And, a 
spokesman for the corPoration says that without the specialty center, the . 
convenience center will not be built. 

The Man in the Pink Bunny Suit 
comically concludes, in the best 
Gracie Allen tradition, that If there 
aren't enough TAs, then the only 
thing left to do is have the 
professors "work a little more. " 
He tells the professors that the Big 
Bunny in Berkeley is upset that 
they don't have enough " contact 
hours" with students for him to get 
more lettuce from the Bunnies in 
Sacramento. Never mind the fact 
that they must stop doing 199s 
(wrong kind of " contact hours") or 
that none of the green stuff will 
ever get to uam. 

The Man in the Pink Bunny Suit 
says that if there's no money to pay 
the TAs to work, why then they 
must work for free because 
teaching is an education for them. 

If this ala nns you as much as it alarms us, you should go to the coWicil 
hearing Wednesday and make yourself heard. The way the coWicil is 
currently divided, UCSD's councilman Gil Johnson could verY well cast 
the deciding vote. 

Open Letter to Students 

Don't Let ASUCSD Abuse Power 
Well folks, it's new government 

time at UCSD. We got a whole 
passle of new leaders, newly 
elected and ready to go. 

To go where? 
As we all know these good 

or boys (and girls) have been 
promising to keep student fees 

down. This was a major plank in 
everY platfonn. 

But rumour has it they are 
already breaking their word. The 
officers have gotten g reedy. They 
plan to (or already have) asked the 
Registration Fee committee to 
raise fees. 

YSA's Attack on Zionism 
Viewed as Racist Action 

There is a truly radical group of students on campus. But you'll rarely 
see its members in class unless you're taking Sloganism 100, Extension 
169 - "The Big Lie," or Optics 000 - " Myopic Vision." These modem 
pariahs don't view the world 's peoples as having diverse histories, 
cultures, tastes, conflicting political and economic interests, or 
ecological and spir itual Wlity. 

The members of the YSA live in a zero suro world of red and white and 
mediocre tw~way classification. Complex problems involving the in-
terests of labor, consumers, business environmentalists or nudists are 
reduced to simple class conflicts between workers and greedy 
shareho'ders, oppressors4llld the oppressed. Though the YSA hopes that 
simplist iC stone age ideology and problem solving by rules of thumb will 
catch tt e fancy of the masses, its membership dwindles and attempts 
a nonymity. 

Its influence curbed by the defeat of the pet Cooperative and frustrated 
by popt.lar rejection of unrevolutionary ideals the YSA is again turning 
its propaganda guns on Zionism and the troubled state of Israel. On this 
score it is joined oy Olr~ l working "Ia~ rep.resentatives such as oil 
companies, Ara b Sheiks, many corporate executives and state depart-
ment o:fi ials who clearly see the Arab-YSA view is in the long run 
economl(; 'nterests of the US . 

While any people including myself criticize Israeli or US governinent 
policy, tile ghost writer representing the YSA attacks the right of the 
Jewish people to a homeland in ERETZ YISRAEL or simply the right of 
Israel to exist. It m ust be clearly understood that to most Jews an attack 
on Zionism is inseparable f rom an attack on the Jewish people and thus 
anti-semitism. 

Although Zionism as a national movement only dates back to the mid 
19th centurY, Zion as a national concept is as old as the Babylonian Exile 
which began in 586 BCE. Separation of the Jewish people from the land of 
Israel by ancient conquerors led to a timeless longing for their homeland. 
A feeling for the dynamic forces that genera ted the political zionist 
movement and led to the establislunent of the state of Isra I in 1948 Is best 
captured in the words of the Psa \mist 137 ; 5-6: 

Continu d on Page:S 

Why do they want to raise fees? 
To provide new programs to 

benefit the students? To increase 
the number of TAs for next year? 
NO. They are requesting fee raises 
to pay themselves salaries. $1000 
for commissioners and $J500 for 
the pres . 

Dear reader, they realize the 
apathy on this campus and think 
that they can vote themselves 
bread and circuses; because 
nobody cares. 

I am a student. I care.' 
I am disgusted to think I should 

pay more to go to school because 
the ASUCSD officers vote them-
selves a salarY; in direct co& 
tradiction of everY campaign 
promise they made. Jeff Uefer 
promised us fees would not rise! !! 

I charge everY student, who 
wants to keep student fees down, to 
write to: REG FEE COMMITrEE, 

~23, UCSD. Tell them you refuse 
to pay ASUCSD officers a salarY. 
Get mad people! If we let them get 
away with this there will be no 
limit on their abuse of students. 
They will believe what they have 
been told. Once you are elected, 
you can get away with anything. 
Integrity? . 

The ASUCSD offlcers, especially 
our president, should be com-
mitted to the welfare of the student 
body : not himself. He is making ~ 
gesture of bad faith by requesting a 
salary. 

I challenge the ASUCSD to a& 
swer my charges. I encourage 
them to drop their ambition to put 
student money in their pocket. 

In the event that reg fees are 
increased to provide salaries for 
the officers, I see no recourse for 
the student body but to petition for 
a recall election. This requires the 
signatures of 100 students (10%) .

New Indicator Defends 
Political Views of KKK 

Of the manifold manifestations of intolerance in this world, it took the 
New indicator's intolerance of the Ku Klux Klan to provoke Richard 
stevens to express his dismay in print - in another newspaper, yet, not 
in dialogue with the verY people he tries to reduce to the level ci the 
Klan. He ignores the substance of the New indicator's reasoned 
argument against the right of the KKK to exist as a group which 
foments terror, murder, racial hatred, etc., and in favor of the Pe& 
dleton 14's right to defend themselves. Instead, he tried to equate that 
argUment with the KKK's position that certain racial groups have no 
right to exist because they don 't meet the KKK's " standards." 

Stevens' reductionist and artificial equation is no more valid than UC 
President Saxon's comparison last year of anti-CIA demonstrators with 
the CIA. stevens says we should judge individuals by their actions, not 
be their group or class. Well, the action of the New IDcUcator has been to 
disseminate information, to open a forum for analysis of society, to 
engage the university community in dialogue. The action of the KKK on 
the other hand has been to spread fear and loathing, to lynch, bum and 
so on. Are these actions in any way equivalent? 

To correct a few more of stevens' misleading assertions: 
The New Indicator has never advocated the extennination ci any 

class of people. To do so would amount to partial suicide, since the 
paper's workers themSelves come from different social classes. 

The New ludicator has never evinced an unconcern for anyone in 
Uganda. We have printed nothing about Uganda simply because we do 
not yet know' enough about the situation there. We do object, however, to 
the media's gleeful exploitation of the image they have presented of 
Amin and to the attempt to use Uganda to justify South African apar-
theid on the supposed grounds that Africans are not ready for or capable 
of self-government. 

The New ladicator has never advocated use of the government to 
suppress the KKK. In fact, our anal sis has tried to show that the KKK 
seems to flourish whenever the government and corporations have an 
economic crisis, when people are dissatisfied and threaten to orpnize 
themselves. The KKK functions then to keep people divided and 
ignorant of the real cause of their problema. A leaked naval intelliaence 
report blames the Marine brass for allowillg the KKK to flourIIb. at 
Pendleton. . 

We consider it highly unlikely that there can exist a peaceful society 
in which races can exiBt harmonically ~ude groups which preacb their 
extermination and actively engage in terrorism and murder designed to 
deny them full citizenship. While the KKK sees societal conflict baaed 
on race as inevitable and unchangeable, we see conflict rooted to social 
conditions created by humans and susceptible to change by hwnalll. We 
are not ashamed to say that we are working toward a long~nge goal rI. 
a society in which no class holds an advaatage over another and in 
which there would therefore be no reNOn for groups like the KKK. 
which feed only on race hatred and ciaSlutlvisions, to exist. 

We ha ve Dever, however, denied the right oftbe individuala whO make 
up the KKK to exist. We hold out the hope that any individual can 

hange. That is a primary reason we are engaged In the eschanle rI.

YSA is "Blatantly Anti-Semitic" Coutinued from Page Z And if things really get tight, the

superfluous to education anyway.

Why should it be as natural for

Wby should Arab officers and

Why should Arabic be an official 
language of the country, on a par

Why should hundreds of 
thousands of Arab tourists be 
crossing freely into Israel everY 
year? (157,000 last year) 

Why should thousands of Arab

Why should 50 percent of the

earning before and to work for the

by one of the most advanced trade 
Wlion organizations in the world? 

The lies and distortions evident 
in the YSA article can only con-
clude that the YSA is blatantly 
anti-semitic , Israel lives in close 
daily contact on a basis of mutual human respect and dignity with 
over a million Palestinian Arabs ; 
they meet with them, discuss with 
them, debate with them, have joint 
television programs with thetn and 
understand what they feel and 
think. 

Pending an overall political 
solution, it should be emphasized 
that this problem cannot be 
isolated from the overall Middle 
East problem. Israel should be 
proud of their humane approach. 
Proud, because of the fact that 
des pite the pressures and 
provocations over the years in 
which the most heinous crimes 
have been committed by terrorists , 
they have never carried out the 
death penalty, 

Proud, because of the fact that 
4,100,000 people crossed the open 
bridges over the River Jordan in 
both directions between 1968 and 
1975; that of a total of 16,000 ad-
ministrative officials in the 

territories only 500 are Israelis, 
that all the mayors and municipal 
councils have been elected by free 
and secret ballot, that three 
newspapers in East Jerusalem are 
edited, written and published by 
Arab editors and journalists with 
absolute freedom to express any 
political opinion, including ex-
treme views opposing the state of 
Israel, proud of the absolute 
freedom of religion granted to all 
beliefs. Proud of all this, because 
Israel knows that it has already 
created a bridge to the Arab world. 

As a postscript, I submit that 
while the YSA article claims that 
Israel is the most unsafe place in 
which a Jew could live, in view of 
their "egalitarian " a nd 
" progressive" ideals, they all too 
glibly forget the oppressed J ews 
and other peoples in Argentina, 
Iraq, Saudi Ara bia, Syria, 
Ethiopia, the Soviet Union ... need I 
go on? Israel, however imperfect it 
may still be, tries to implement the 
highest ideals of democracy-
political, social, and cultural-for 
all inhabitants, regardless of 
religious belief, race or sex.

In short Zionism and its 20th Century manifestation in the birth of

What the YSA is really saying when it attacks Zionism is that national

racist and reactionarY. 

Just as historians of Middle-Eastern affairs may legitimately ask who 
are the Palestinians, I ask who is the YOWig Socialist Alliance? Why don't 
your members sign their names to YSA polemics? The UCSD community 
'Should beware of groups with monolithic views that write nameless 
letters to the newspaper. The YSA is either few in numbers or totalitarian 
in intent.

"I believe the RegerU are moving reasonably," he said. "I talked 

with the group representing the students and tried to detail the position« 
William Coblentz, Chainnan « the Board of Regents, who is going about 
to different corporations and asking them about their South African In-
vestments. 

McElroy expressed some surprise at being singled out for the 
demonstration, but said, " I've been throop this thing so many times in 
the past 15 years you almost get used to it." He added though that he waS 
"a little bit scared" for the safety of others, as he has been in situations in 
the past which have turned to rocks and Dying glass.

"Supporting careful devestment over a period « time so as to not hurt 

anyone in no way means 1 support the current situation in South Africa," 
McElroy said. "Dave Ryer (Assistsnt Chancellor) went to South Africa 
recently with the hopes « helping to institute a program allowing blacks 
to come to the US for further education. He terms the situation there 
'very racist', and I agree. J

"South Africa is the Issue of our 
time," Dortch said. 

A third speaker was Laura Lent, 
a Santa Cruz resident who told 
about demonstrations at the 
university there, where 401 people, 
including about 135 non-students, 
were arrested for misdemeanor 
trespassing. 

After the speakers finished, the 
people fonned a march which 
wound around the campus and 
eventually culminated at the 
chancellor's complex. The 250 
marchers clapped in unison and 
chanted, " What's the word 
Johannesburg? UCout now." 

When the marchers arrived at 
Chancellor McElroy's office, they 
found three campus police officers 
standing in front of the chan-
cellor's locked door.

Letter ... 
Continued from Page 1 
Students Have a Point 

The letter can be attributed to 
the student demonstrations and 
pressure that occurred throughout 
the UC system last week. Accor-
ding to Coblentz, "you may not like 
the student behavior, but they do 
have a point." 

The 'letter to the corporations 
opens, "As you are aware, interest 
in American investment in South 
Africa has been the focus of in-
creasing concern and interest in 
recent months. 

"While many believe US firms 
are greatly improving the social 
and economic condition of South 
African blacks, others feel that this 
is not the case ." 

The letter mentions "six prin-
ciples". adopted by 12 US cor-
porations last March and asks the 
37 corporations to whom the letter 
was sent if they are working to 
implement: 

-Nonsegregation of races in all 
eating, comfort and work facilities . 

-Eq~l and fair employment 
practices for all workers.

posed to be locked.) 

Cops iDllide Office 
In addition to those officers, 

several unifonned officers were 
inside McElroy's office and ap-
proximately six plain-clothes of-
ficers were present. 

While the protesters marched 
through the ro«.ed complex, their 
chanting amplified by echoes, 
administrators occasionally 
peered out -from behind curtained 
windows. 

After walking by McElroy's 
office several times, the protestors 
filled the complex's smaU court-
yard to hear more speakers and 
make future plans. Anthony 
Gonzales, one of the rally 
organizers, said, "We need 2000 
or 3000 angry people here to bring 
pressure on McElroy. We need the 
organization to bring that many 
people to jam on him."

-Initiation and development of 
training programs that will 
prepare, in substantial numbers, 
blacks and other nonwhites for

-An increase in the number of 
blacks and other nonwhites in

"A Jacqu reI Fantasy," an 
original produ~ion of ten BreI 
songs written, directed and per-
formed by Cindee "Crystal the

includes mime, magic, laser 
lighting, live music, live acting,

" By combining the 
sophistication of laser technology, 
magic and other colorful media 
with the emotional impact of BreI 
music, I believe the show will have 
universal appeal," explained 
Cindee Grace. 

"The clowns are the spiritual

'Viscious But Fair" 

Streetwo II~ers Lock Energy ,I ntensity 
by Ted Burke 
Staff Writer 

Viscious But Fair - Streetwalkers 
(Mercury) 

Even the best of us aren't 
capable of giving out 100 percent 
all times, and Streetwalkers, who 
produced the best hard rock album 
last year [Red Card], are no ex-
ception, Red Card was a masterful 
culmination of rock and raunch 
filtered through deceptively simple 
motif. The songs had good 
hooklines, arrangements and 
primal drive, the singing was 
manic, and the lyrics, by singer 
Roger Chapman, revelled in a 
dizzy, zany area of banal 
surrealism. With VueioUl But 
Fair, the band sounds exhausted, 
as though recuperating from 

" taking their best shot" (in the 
locker room parlance from 
Rocky.) The album isn't bad, 
however. Some moments approach 
the closed system intensity of their 
best work, but none of it achieVes 
the peaks. "Dice Man," potentially 
the best track on the albwn, is a 
dramatic perfonnance that builds 
slowly around a theme of a gam-
bler's loser mythology-always on 
the run and all-but is ennervated 
by a cumbersome length and solo · 
spots by guitarist Charlie Whitney. 
"Sam" and' "Crosstime Woman" 
fare better, with more judicious 
construction and intelligent al>-
plicati9n of talent. The bulk of the 
album is diluted, though. The 
lyrics this time out are 
throwaways, the music languishes 
in a post-mortem funk, and the 

atmosphere is conducive to 
catatonia. Streetwalkers is still a 
band to watch out for. Let's hope 
their next effort has some life to it.

Tweotiflfth Anniversary Reunion -
Dave Brubeck Quartet (Horizon) 

Neither long absence from old 
company nor creaking bones have 
affected the Dave Bruebeck 
Quartet. Recorded at Interlochen 
Music School in Michigan, Reunion 
is like stepping into a time warp, 
with the Quartet wasting no time in 
performing the cool, lyrical, bone 
bare improvisations that made 
them the most successful jazz 
group in America in their heyday. 
Bruebeck's piano work remains 
thoughtful and eloquently un-
derstated, with deft chord con-
structions which push the rhythmic 
edge when needed, and polished 
solos that sparkle like diamonds 
under a display case. Paul 
Desmond's alto saxophone sorties, 
which typified the Quartet's sound 
more than anything else, are 
imbued with a warm friendly tone, 
establishing the melodic 
statements and then diverting to 
tactfully embroidered ideas that 
expand the songs into excursions of 
reserved virtuosity. Eugene 
Wright on bass and Joe Morello on 
drums supply a firm bottom which 
never over rides what the others 
are doing. The best moments are 
on Paul Desmond's classic "Take 
Five," extended here to nine 
minutes plus, B.
