Sophomores to get 
inter,college housing 
Warren apts. will house 

students from any college 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Staff Writer 

ophomOfc studcnts will havc 
the option of living with friends 
from other colleges ne.xt year as 
part of the returning all-campu 
housing program. 

Under the program, hou ing 
administrators plan to open 25 
Earl Warren Collcge apartmcnts 
to 100 tudents from all across 
the campu . 

.,\ \'h at you're seeing now is a 
lot of blending of the students at 
different college because of 
dcmJnd, " ~ald ,"lark 
Cunningham, director of 
I 10usll1g and Dining Services. 

J Ie said that more and more 
students have been forced to live 
at another campus than the one 
they are registered in because of 
housing shortage. 

.. nder lhe current systcm, if 
VOli want to live with a' studcnt 
from another college, YOll can't. 
Your only choice is to movc off 
campus," Cunningham said. 

"That was really the idea of all-
campus housing: to allow folks 
the opportunity to Ido that] . Now 
that they've bonded with friends 
- particularly if not by choice 
but imply by u putting them 
together - they can now have 
that opportunity." 

The option will bc open to all 
second-year snldents who lived 
on campus their first year. 

As part of a rCYlscd housing 
selcction process, modified to 
accommodate this program, 
interested students apply before 
the normal room-selcction date, 
Cunningham said. 

"We want to handle this first, 
becau e what it affects is equity 
among colleges. Since we don't 
control who applie , you could 
have three Revelle College stu-
dents and one John 1uir ollege 
student," he said. "So we would 
do this part first, then make sure 
that all numbers are re-corrected 
to make sure there's balance, and

Web site shares stories of 

fire impact on UCSD 
A Web site accessible through the main

Belvin, who helped set up on-the·spot care for 
fire evacuees. Others focused on the 
Respiratory Care and Medical Bum Unit's 
responses 0 the crisis, with a telling of how 
UCSD health care staff helped set up a 
makeshift day care center so that co-workers 
with children could stay at work. Arlo her story

the home of KeTIy Briggs, associate diredor of 
development at the Jacobs School of

Video footage showing early stages of the 
Cedar Fire is available from Hans-Wemer 
Braun, a research scentlst at San Diego 
Supercomputer Center, who shot the footage 
as part of wireless networking research from 
the top of ML Laguna. The footage shows the 
spread of the fire 300 times faster than it hap-
pened. Students who helped organize relief 
efforts on campus were he focus of another 
story, with a speeal emphaSIS on UCSD 
Community Cares, a drive that became so 
large It go the attention of Sen. Diane 
Feinstein (D-CA), whose office called the 
organization to recognize their efforts.

" I think it's a great place," 
Taylor said. "It's a good way to get 
away from the everyday grind and 
wind down with good food and 
good people." 

The Che's location was orginial-

etarians a choice." 
Some students fclt the distance 

of the cafe could be a deterrence. 
"It's kind of far away, but if I 

really needed food or a drink., I 
would go there," Lynch said. 

Other students said they have not 
tried the Che Cafe. 

"My friends don't go there so it' 
not something that I think of

Katrina White said.

THE U 0 GUARDIAN NEW. 3 

Romance policy under review 
Relationships, harrasment defined 
By TAM HOANG 
Contributing Writer 

Policy revisions on sexua l 
hara sment and consensual rela-
tionships between faculty, staff 
and students on UC campuses are 
under formal review. All faculty 
and sta ff a t the U niversi ty of 
California received a memo on 
Sept. 25 detailing the new poli-
cies and were a ked to give feed-
back.. 

Some revisions include an 
update on what qualifies as sexual 
harassment and add prohibitions 
on consensual rel ationships 
between not just students and fac-
ulty, but nonteaching staff as well. 
According to UC representative 
Abby Lunardini , the revisions are 
an attempt to create a more cohe-
sive policy. 

"After the policies are final, 
then each UC campus will amend 
its policy to the final resolution," 
said Lori Chamberlain, director of 
the UCSD Office of Sexual 
Harassment Prevention and 
Policy. 

Each policy had a draft writ-
ten by different groups. While 
the UC Office of General 
Counsel, in conjunction with the 
human resources department, 
detailed the new revisions for 
sexual harassment, a group of 
different representatives who 
handle academic affairs dealt 
with consensual relationship 
Issues. 

The new policy proposes a 
strict ban of consensual relation-
hips between students and any 

facu lty or taff where there may 
be a potential conflict of interest. 

These connicts, it stated, would 
lead to an abuse of power, coer-
cion, exploitation or favoritism 
on the part of the faculty and 
staff. According to Chamberlain, 
not all UC campuses currently 
have specific policies on consen-
sual relationships. 

Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd feels that the 
poli cy addresses a common issue. 

"Unfortunatcly, consensual 
relationships between tudems 
and facul ty ha ppen more than 
people think," Boyd sa id . 

" Unfartunately, 
consensual relationships 
between students and 
faculty happen more 

often than people think." 
- Jeff Boyd. Commissioner of 

Student Advocacy 

ew policies on consensual 
relationships not only focus on 
prohibiting those between stu-
dents and staff and faculty, but 
look to prevent them as well. 
Boyd cited an example that a the-
atre major may not have a reh-
tionship with a faculty member of 
the theatre deparonent even if the 
student is not immediately 
enrolled in the faculty member's 
class. 

exual hara ment also come 
under review. The policy 

addresses disciplinary action for 
those "responsible for reporting 
or responding to sexual harass-
ment who knew about the 
harassment and took no action to 
Stop it or failed to report the pro-
hibited haras ment." It also 
describes prohibition of and dis-
ciplinary action for intentionally 
false reports of sexual harass-
ment. 

The policy revisions come ill 
the wake of the resignation of 
John Dwyer, dean of UC 
Berkeley's Boalt I [all School of 
Law, following allegatiOns that he 
sexually harassed a former law stu-
dent. Dwyer, who resigned in 
December 2002, admitted to a 
si ngle consensual encounter with 
a student, but denied the charges 
of sexual harassment. 

According ro Lunardiru, the 
policy revisions "didn't stem from 
any incidents." 

However, Chamberlain said 
there is a connection between 
Dwyer's resignation and policy 
revi iollS. 

"It would be naive to say 
[Dwyer's re ignation] had nothing 
to do with it," Chamberlain said. 
"It probably speeded things up 
regarding policy revisions." 

According to Chamberlain, 
staff and faculty are asked to give 
feedback due to some po sible dis-
agreement with the policies. 

" orne people may fear that 
free speech is trod upon with the 
exual hara sment policy," 

Chamberlain said. "Some may 
also want the freedom of choice t~ 
have a relationship."

Chancellors neglect UCSD students 
Chandler 
must open 
herself to 
students' 
concerns 
and 
create a 
forum 
for 
student 
input 

Shawn No/Guordian 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

T Wo weeks ago, UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale held his quarter-
ly "office hour" with fi ve randomly 
chosen students. They were each 
given 10 minutes to express all of 
their concerns about the university. 
Of course, since these five students 
went to UCLA, their complaints 
were relatively benign, ranging 
from " I can't always get my meal 
tickets" to "the film program here 

is somewhat difficult." 
Ten minutes doesn't quite 

seem long enough to express 
the problems that plague 
UCSD, from the lack of any 
school spirit to the lack of 
support for athletics (you 
think these might be con-
nected?), to the la-minute 
passing period, to the fact 
that students pay $400 per 
year for the right not to 

find a parking space, to our 
student governments com-

plete and utter lack of gov-
erning power over UCSD 
policy, to the fact that the aver-
age UC 0 student has the 
social skills of a turd. 

Ten minutes won't even 
begin to address any of these 
problems. But 10 minutes is 

infinitely better 
than no time at 
all, which is 
what Acting 
Chancellor 
Marsha A. 

Chandler 
gives 

the average UCSD student -
unle s you count the fact that stu-
dents are "permitted" to send e-
mails to our chancellor, in which 
ca e the average student can poten-
tially get 90 seconds (the time it 

ta~.es for the average person to 
dIgest an e-mail before deleting it). 

That is, of course, assuming 
that the chancellor actually looks at 
these e-mails, though it is sorely 
obvious that he (or, recently, she) 
does not. 

Last July, a man named Bob 
Clay sent Chancellor Robert C. 
Dynes a letter asking for a 
reprieve in the number of 
all-at-ucsd-distfiYucsd.tdu e-mails, 
which waste time and money when 
UCSD faculty and 

" 

students could walk past and ignore 
him. 

It's a bit premature to bring dll s 
up, seeing how Chandler has only 
held tlle office for a few months now, 
but would it be too much to ask to 
see her follow Dynes' example and 
coordinate an event or two for the 
students, or appear in person once in 
a while? Students may be the lowest 
rung in the money ladder and can-
not compare to the monetary plea-
sure derived from reaping billions of 
dollars from corporations in the 
name of "research," but even the 
lowest rung on a ladder deserves 
some token outreach. 

So, how can Chandler and future 
chancellors combat this sense of 

alienation and dis-
gust from the sru-
dent body that 

students are forced 
to sift through and 
delete them. This 
was a reasonable 
gripe, and he pro-
po cd a reasonable 
solution: make 
another mailing list 
for key administra-
tors and spare 
everyone el e from 

... [Dynes] lived in a 
house worth more 

than Revelle 
College. /J 

tems front the 
current " 15 -sec-
ond rule?" It's easy. 
All they need to do 
is put themselves 
in the shoes of 3 
typical VCSD snl -
dent and drink 
heavily on the 

the e-mails that don't apply to 
them. Five months later, the daily 
e-mails telling students how faculty 
can split up their administrative 
leave show no signs of stopping. 
Therefore, based on the chancel-
lor's failure to heed Clay's advice, 
let's revise our estimate to 15 sec-
ond~: the time the chancellor is 
rtaJIy willing to spend with the 
average VCSD student. 

These results can be interpreted 
in a way that all UCSD students can 
understand: nerd-speak. 10 minutes 
(600 seconds) divided by 15 seconds 
gives us a disturbing ratio: the 
UCLA administration cares about 
its students 40 times more than 
UCSD's. 

So, what's the solution? How can 
UCSD bring the e dismal stati tics 
to a more rea onable level for a 
"fir t -class" university? A good 
place to start would be the example 
of Dynes. 

We all know that the average 
VCSD student didn't have a very 
high opinion of how much time 
Dynes pent with the average 
VCSD student, seeing that he lived 
in a house worth more than Revelle 
College and that most students 
never even saw his face until it was 
plastered on trash cans all over 
campus, accompanied by the word 
"posse." 

But in his defense, Dynes at least 
tried . He kept close relationship 
with the A.S. Council, organized a 
fun fundraiser for undergraduate 
scholarship (the Chancellor's 
Challenge 5K Run) and poke at 
numerous events, even Out in Price 

en ter dUrIng lunch, wherc the 

weekends to forget about how mis-
erable their Monday-to-Friday rou-
tine is. 

Or, how about following the 
example of the other UC chools 
by teaching a course now and 
then, or attending a U SO home 
game, or eating in the insipid on-
campus dining halls instead of the 
Faculty Club once a week, or 
holding receptions and press con -
ferences for undergraduate lead-
ers, or simply holding open office 
hours. 

Chancellors could also raise 
their awareness of UCSD srudent 
living conditions by living in the 
dormitories with an albino pro-
grammer roommate who eats 
nothing but Kraft Singles, or 
encouraging our moderate reek 
population on campus by jo ining a 
"Frat" (or, if female, the chancello r 
could join a " orc"). Any o f thc e 
suggestions (or any of the serious 
suggestions above) would do wo n-
ders for campus morale, whi ch 
seems to pcrpenlally waver some-
where berween " unsa ti sfacto ry" 
and "complete death ." 

At any rale, current and future 
chanccllor (as well as other exec-
utive admini trators) necd to 
extend their involvement with 
tudents out of the digital realm 

and out of the "under-a- minute" 
time frame . Anything short of 
surpassing UC L 's margin all y 
passing mark of on e-hour publi c 
input per quarter and Chandler 
will have brought herself down to 
the level of the typical UCSD s tu-
dent in term of apathy and gross 
negligence.

MONDAY, NOVEMEBER 10,2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN O PINION 5 

Lessons learned in the United States capital 
Washington stint bore minimal similarities to 'Legally Blonde 2' 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

My pa t 10 or so summers have becn dominated hy a standard cocktail of sum-
mer school, retail jobs and general 
laziness and lethargy. Perhaps it 
was newfound inspiration, ambi-
tion or maturity (doubtful) that led 
me to make this summer different 
from the others. I had the privilege 
this summer of interning in 
Washington, D.C., through the 
Academic Intern hip Program 
(which r highJy recommend check-
ing out - it's in the Lit. Building in 
Earl Warren College) 

r tend to scan all my VCSD 
spam and Gllardian ads for oppor-
tunities, and had found this partic-
ular program to be very compatible 
with my interests. After spending a 
fair amount of time during winter 
and spring quarters ex.haustively 
searching through materials and 
applying for various internships, 
from think-tanks to government 
o ffices, I hopped onboard the first 
o rganization that accepted me and 
was shi pped off to the east coast to 
begin my inaugural summer-
unl ike-a ny-other adventure. 

I spent ten weeks drafting corre-
sp ndcnce to congressmen, com-
piling re po rt and doi ng racial -
relations research. As I write this 
o n l pl easam ovclllber day, 1 real -
ize it ha s taken me a coupl e of 
mont hs to uncover and di ges t 
lessom Icarned thac rela te to evcry-

I •• 
UNIVERSITY CE NT"RS 

thing from life at UCSD to the 
pink fantasy world that is Elle 
Woods' legalistic blonde Capitol 
e capade. And here they are ... 

Lesson No. I : Enjoy the 
California weather. Trust me on 
this one. 

Lesson No. 2 : Government 
waste is epidemic. For example, 
one of my jobs as a conciliation 
intern at the V.S Department of 
Justice, Community Relations 

ervice Division, which dealt with 
mediation of racial conflicts, was to 
print out daily bulletins for the 
director. These bulletins were 400 
pages each, and I printed maybe 
two or three each day. Most of 
them probably ended up in the 
trash, and our office didn't recycle. 
I once tried to say something about 
it, but was warned not to make a 
ruckus about it. Were they going to 
send some G -men to quiet me 
down? Also, government waste 
conjoins with office gossip. This, of 
course, is prevalent in any office, 
but it was made quite clear through 
the talk that a lot of the employees 
didn't do their work or gave it to 
the interns to do (all three of us) . 
Some of them took two-hour-Iong 
"walks." I discovered they could do 
thi because it is almost impo ible 
to fire non-management govern-
ment employee; it take many 
years for a complai nt to get 
through the bureaucracy. 

Le on No. 3: Public figures 
are an odd bunch. I saw Attorney 
General John hcroft, whom I'm 
ure all ultra-liberal college stu-

dents adore , on mo re than one 
occasion. He gave a lecture to the 
Justice Department interns, and 
held an Independence Day celebra-
tion complete with free Ben and 

Jerry's (tax dollars finally at work!) 
and an awards ceremony. His 
speeches weren't too inspiring -
almost every single one exclusively 
referenced Sept. 2001 (you'd think 
two years after the fact he'd tout 
something else) - and he seemed 
like a smiling plastic doll when 
hordes of starstruck interns pu hed 
and shoved to get a picture with 
him. I also saw some senators, all of 
whose speeches were alien, too cal-
culated, too indicative of years of 
political honing. Also, every public 
figure is trailed by an entourage of 
security detail, and it seemed to me 
a curious spectacle when officials 
that aren 't even that prominent 
need more care than most exotic 
animals require. 

Lesson No. 4 : The world con-
sists of more than just 20-year-olds. 
Working in an environment where 
the median age was 45 or so, I 
learned how differently I had to act 
when around people twice my age. 
I got used ro, and admittedly slight-
ly annoyed with, daily "How do 
you do's," which were to be 
returned with the obligatory "Fine, 
thanks." However, I learned that 
this was just a part of how office 
(and older?) life is. [ remember 
more than once I carelessly 
employed a sarcastic remark typical 
of my repartee with UCSD friends 
and was met with puzzlement and 
even slight offense. One of my fel-
low interns was relentlessly deter-
mined , if not ruthless , and her 
youthful ambition was a marked 
contrast to the regular cmployees' 
seasoned demeano r and mundane 
acceptance of the ir 15-year job 
tenure. n a more pleasant no te , at 
the Y 1CA, I befri e ndcd a 72 -year-
old E th iopian lawyer who went 

there ro work out every night. It 
was an eye-opener ro talk to some-
one with that much experience and 
life under his belt. 

Lesson No.5: Washington 
D .C. is nothing and everything like 
"Legally Blonde 2 's" glossy portrait 
of it. The Capitol is a glamorous, 
marbled place, and r was envious of 
the interns who worked there. I also 
realized, however, that the govern-
ment is 90 percent run by security 
officers, administrative assistants, 
ecrion supervisors and night jani-

tors, and 10 percent by high-level 
officials, Congressmen and big 
hots. The tree-lined avenues, ele-

gant monuments, countless muse-
ums, fireworks on the Fourth all 
compose a truthful albeit partial pic-
ture of Washington D.C. The city is 
also tragically poor and violent, 
overrun by daily murders reported 
in the paper. And who knows how 
seamy the political undercurrent is. 
[n that way, Washington is a fit rep-
resentation of America itself -
tranquil and troubled. 

Lesson No.6: The University 
of California is a mighty asset. I 
lived in the newly built UC 
Washinj,>1on Center in the heart of 
the city with about 200 other UC 
students. It serves as lobbying head-
quarters for the Universi ty of 
California and is also equipped with 
huge apartments with televisions 
and dishware, classrooms, a com-
puter lab, ecurity personnel and 
other amenities. I don't th ink I've 
ever realized to uch an extent the 
benefits of belongi ng to a massive 
public state university. When I came 
back to CSD, I found myself very 
fond of its ervi ces and opportuni-
ti es. Someti mes you tend ro fo rget 
what it has to offer. 

Lesson No.7: Life is work. 
Work is life. I worked about 43 
hours a week for free a t the office, 
behind a computer every single day. 
That is not supposed to be a com-
plaint, although it sounds like one. I 
was always tOO tired to cook at night 
and settled for frozen food and 
"Friends" reruns. veryday I wore 
skirts and blouses, rode the subway, 
had my own cubicle, took a half-
hour lunch break and slept nine 
hours every night. T his is what life 
is probably like fo r most o f the pop-
ulation. It is not going ro sleep at 3 
a. m .; it is not goi ng out wi th friends 
every night; it is not Fashion Va lley 
and Tea Station and Geisel. For me, 
interning was a fun but sho rt- lived 
experience. For o thers, it is provid-
ing for their famil ies, meeti ng 
expense and making u e o f their 
days. I suppose amidst the relative 
surreal whirlwind of college, I'd for-
gotten the purpose of obtaining a 
degree in the first place. 

At the risk of making this col-
umn sound like a g radua tion 
speech, I bid you to treasu re these 
college years and treasure your 
friends . My UCSD fr iends sent me 
care packages and ca lled me, and I 
felt quite loved by thei r thoughtful -
ness. But how long IS fo ur yea rs, 
though - un ti l you all pa rt ' How 
long before we watch children 
grow, lose hair, grow home ga r-
dens, lose job, grow up? C heri h

I enjoyed \ VashingtOn , D .C. It 
provided a red, whi te and blue

fires," from Nov. 3 is nothing 
more than a biased attempt to 
promote President Bush's own 
misguided Healthy Forest 
Initiative. Frelich shamelessly

" Frelich shamelessly used 
the recent San Diego 

firesot'rm to manipulate 
the pathos of the fragile 

and vulnerable 
communal emotional 

state to further his own 
skewed political agenda." 
- David Piekarski. Earl Warren 

College sophomore 

to further his own skewed politi-
cal agenda. 

It is true that forest fires are 
bad. [t is true th.at we would like 
to prevent them. Sen. Diane 
Feinstein (D -CA) wa correct 
when he said, "There is a 

tremendous Ie son in these fires 
- that the land has to be man-
aged." However, "thinning," a 
euphemism for logging and a cen-
tral tenet to the [ IealtllY Forest 
Initiative, is not the way to pre-
vent fires . [n fact, old-growth 
forests are actually resistant to 
fire . 

Rather than reduce the 
amount of trees, we should inter-
mittently carry out prescribed 
burns, which help limit the 
alllount of dry underbrush on the 
forest's floor. This underbrush 
acts as kindling and pose the 
largest threat. If you've ever lit a 
campfire you would know that thc 
large logs aren't what burn initial-
ly, rather it is ti,e small dry leaves 
and twigs that ignite. 

Prescribed burns arc a logical 
preventative method that, if done 
regularly, can save taxpayers money 
in fire-fighting costs while simulta-
neously preventing fire and main-
taining ti,e ecological beauty of San 
Diego. It docsn 't take a rna ter logi-
cian to realize that if there arc no 
forests then there can be no forest 
fires . However, these fore ts can 
not be de troyed because thcy are 
reservoirs ofbiodiver ity, and elim-
inating them would decimate an 
important piece of ti,e world 's 
genetic diver ity and create poten-
tial ha7..ards to air quality and ani-
mal and plant pecies. 

Bush's HealtllY Forest Inioative 
is a blatant mi -nomer (healthy 
implies alive and existent). It would 
destroy a vital piece of OUf ecosys-
tcm. I hope you wouldn't amputate 
an arm to prevent an infection, just 
like you wouldn't desuoy the forest 
to prevent forest fires . 11lis initia-
tive is detrimental to the environ-
ment and plainly disproporoonal to 
the problem at hand. 1aybe Bush 
is compensating for sometlung' 

UCSD students have already 
spoken . The UC D chapter of 
CALP[RG collected over 800 
postcards opposing the " I Iealthy 
Foresr Initiative" to add to the 
thousands collected from across 
the nation. To learn more, I would

Vets: Recognition given at fourth annual ceremony 
ronrinlled from ptlge I 

"This ceremony is intended to 
recognize those members of the 
armed service~ that have served 
and ~acnficcd, and those serving 
today as we speak, so that we may 
enjoy the benefits of this country's 
freedom," said Nicholas S. 
Aguilar, chairman of the UCSD 
Veterans Association . "We nrc 
joined by our colleagues and com-
rades in arms who struggled to 
ensure that tho e American prin-
ciples of freedom, safety and secu-
rity are here for us and those all 
around the world." 

The UCSD Veterans 
Association was established in April 
200 I with the mission of promoting 
respect for and providing informa-
tion on the contributions of those 
who erve, or have served, in the 
United States military. 

"We want to promote aware-
ne 5 to the rest of the cam pus of the 
various contributions made by the 
veterans," Aguilar said. "And [ 
want to personally recognize the 
colleagues who have contributed to 
the operation of the university not 
only in the teaching of classes, but 
in promoting the welfare of those 
of u at UC D and San Diego." 

DiMd Ung/GoorcflOn 
Honored: The Veteran of the Year Award was presented to UCSD police officer 
Eddie Shinn at the Fourth Annual Veterans Recognition Ceremony on Nov. 6. 

Corporal Eddie Shinn of 
UC D Police was given the 
UCSD Veteran of the Year Award. 
It was presented by UCSD Police 
Chief Orville King. 

"[ShinnJ joined the univer ity 
in 1990 as an officer and e tab-
lished himself as a true profession-
al in the field of law enforcement, 
which reneers his military and 
naval background," King said. "He 
is dedicated, loyal, compassionate 
and he truly cares about others." 

hilm worked nis way up the 
ranks as E- I me s-cook to licu-
tenant in the avy from 1968 to 
19<)0, eventually bccoming a 

nuclear weapons inspector at orth 
Island. After retirement from the 
Navy, Shinn became a patrol officer 
at UCSD . He currently instructs 
for the Student Organizations and 
Leadershi p Opportuni ties on cam-
pus and lectures on campus safety 
and self-defense. 

"I want to thank the UCSD 
Veterans As ociation for giving me 
the honor of representing the vet-
erans here at UCSD," hinn said . 
"Tne avy has been very good to 
me. Whatever I decided to do, 
wherever I wanted to go to school, 
the Navy ha said, 'You've gOt it.' 
After 20 years of service, [ was to 
either go out to sea once again or 
retire. I elected to come ro UCSD, 
so [ basically exchang.:d one unj -
form for another." 

CSD had not officially rec-
ogni7.ed Veterans Day as a school 
holiday until Aguilar petitioned 
the U Board of Regents . 

"UCSD is the leading institu-
tion with recipients of military 
contracts in federal grants, and 
yet the university had not allotted 
the time to give the same kind of 
deference to those who served 
before the year 2000," AguHar 
said . "One of UCSD's important 
achievements is the formal 
acknowledgement of the valuable 
work that our veterans claim. The 
staff [members] that are veterans 
exemplify the kind of service vet-
erans continue to render even 
after resignation from their posi-
tions. This annual ceremony is 
indeed a tradition that is here to 
stay." 

Scheduled guest speaker Rep. 
Susan Davis of the 53 rd 
Congressional Disoict was not able 
to appear due to the extended 
deferment of a recess in Congress. 
District director for Davis, Todd 
Gloria, spoke on her behalf.

"Higher education can and 
should do more to recognizc the 
work veterans have done," loria 
sa id. "Thi [ceremony] is a grea t 
thing. VVe are fortunate to have 
such a strong veteran community 
in San Diego that may not only be 
one of the largest, but well -con-
nected as well." 

[n Congress, Davis serves on the 
House Armed Services Committee, 
the Education and vVorkforce 
Committee and the Veterans 
Affairs Committee, focusing on 
issues to improve the quality of life 
for service member and their fam-
ilies, according to Gloria . She has 
fought to increase the Veterans Gl 
Bill allowances, veterans ' home 
loan benefits and healthcare, and 
campaigned to develop an annex to 
the Point Lomas military cemetery 
at Miramar Naval Air Base. 

"[Davis] believes our nation 
made a promise to our veterans of 
certain life benefits when they 
promised to serve, and she is 
working on ensuring these agree-
ments," Gloria said. 

Davis is also campaigning for 
Bill HR 303, which would correct 
the situation of "concurrent 
receipt." Presently, veterans are 
taxed $1 of their retirement pay for 
every dollar they receive in disabil-
ity pay. However, HR 303 will 
reduce the disability tax for veter-
ans with a 50 percent or higher dis-
ability rating. Davis briefly 
addressed the ceremony via tele-
phone call from Washington, D.C. 

"I send my best to the veteran 
and my gratitude to them for serv-
ing on our behalf," Davis said. 
"Everyone's time and devotion are 
greatly appreciated ." 

The UC D Veterans 
Association will participate in the 
San Diego Veterans Day Parade 
on Nov. II at II a.m.

In response to possib le concerns, 

the draft sent out to all UC faculty 
and staff included a section address-
ing freed om of speech. For example, 
there would be no restrictions on 
i sues "legitimately related to course 
content and teaching methods of an 
individual faculty member." 

Some s rude nt.~ are conce rned 
with the limitations imposed by 
the anti-consensual relationship 
policy. 

" People should be able to 
choose who they want to have a 
relationship with as long as they are 
willing to do so responsibly," Earl 
Warren College ophomore Bryant 
Pham said. 

According to Chamberlain , her 
deparrment gets between 50 and 60 
reports of sexual harassment a year. 
She said that studies how 90 per-
cent of all sexual harassment cases 
go unreported. 

"It is important to let people 
know how to report seroal harass-
ment," Chamberla in sa id. 

Accordingly, the second ection 
in the new draft of sexual harass-
ment policy addresses the universi-
ty's duty in taking an active role in 
dealing with sexual harassment 
procedure. 

Despite all of the niversity of 
California's efforts to clarify and 
reassert sexual harassment policies, 
some students considered the poli-
cies too strict. 

" [ think this whole sexual 
harassment issue is blown out of 
proportion," John ,\Iuir College 
freshman Chloe I radji-Elias said. 



THE U D GUARDIAN MONDAY. NOVEMBER 10. 2003 

Price: Plans for expansion could include inter~faith, fitness, alumni centers 
continued from page I 

tecrural firm Cannon include four 
different models of space planning. 
T he e models are not archjtectural 
design. but rather de igns on how 
available space could be organized. 
The e include varying locations for 

C 0 Bookstore and the ball -
rooms, as well as the inclusion of 
ncu' studen~ spaces. Committee 
memher voiced their opinions on 
the neces it)' for certain spaces to 
be in specific locations. such as the 
placement of the bookstore for 
optimum retail. 

"I think that the bookstore 
would work best, from a srudent 
perspective, on the south side and 
toward the we t." said Justin 
Williams, rudent co-chair of the 
BAC. "I feel that when srudents 
were a ked, their perception was 
that the expansion wou]c! be for 
student-related elVice and sru -
dent space, such as offices, meeting 
rooms and food. and the bookstore 
taking this space would go against 
this intention." 

T he expansion is currentl y 
planned to extend behind the cur-

rent Price Center. This building, 
or series of building , would be 
constructed according to space 
necessities and monetary con-
traints. 

The ideal building, according to 
architects and committee members, 
would be one that included a sub-
terranean level for parking and ser-
vice. T his level would allow for 
greater space on the ground floor 
of the building and increased prime 
retail space, which is III high 
demand. 

An additi onal plan would 
extend the expansion over the cur-
rent shuttle stop behind Price 
Center and add a subterranean 
level to hou e the shuttle stop and 
offer more underground space. 
T his idea was well-received by the 
committee and considered for fur-
ther plans. 

"[The larger extension J i a 
great idea as far as to provide shel-
ter to the shuttle stop against 
inclement weather, " Williams 
aid . "It will also increase traffic to 

Price Center, which will help sup-
POrt the building and offer more

The A.S. Council supported 
the inter-faith center in a recent 

" The expansion goes 
beyond the first year of 

opening. The inclusion of 
these services will affect 
students for a long time 

after the orginal opening."

Committee 

resolution. It is a project that has 
been considered since 1989 and 
would house office, meeting and 
worslUp space as well as house the 

Office of Religious Affairs. The 
project would be privately funded 
to abide by laws concerning the 
separation of religion and state. 

The alumni relations/visitor 
center would also be privately 
funded . According to plans, it 
would act as a place for alumni and 
students to interact. 

The fitness center would be 
part of a greater wellness center 
planned for an undecided location. 
It would include a variety of ser-
vices, such as recreation rooms, 
showers and possibly new food 
vendors. This committee is mostly 
in favor of this plan for reasons 
varyi ng &om srudent support in 
earlier surveys to achievability of 
the plan. 

"All three programs are very 
imporcant," Williams said. 
"However, I think the 24-hour 
recreation concept would have top 
priority and be most feasible in 
terms of time and cost. It would 
also bring more srudents, which 
would create a more vibrant stu-
dent location. and provide more 
access to recreation for commuter 

students and other students. such 
as those at ixth College who live 
far from other recreation facili -
ties." 

ffi cial decisions rega rding 
the three plans have not ye t been 
made. However, the deadline for 
the BAC was extended to give 
each program more time to devel -
op plans and find donors. It was 
also decided that each program 
would meet with Gary Ratcliff, 
director of University Centers, to 
discuss the scope of the plans. 

The dead line was extended 
from Dec. 5 to Jan . 9, with six 
members voting in favor of the 
extension, two opposing and one 
voting for a longer extension. 

Williams felt that extended 
deadlines were necessary to ensure 
careful planning. 

"1 really believe there is a great 
benefit to providing greater ser-
vices to the students." he said. "The 
expansion goes beyond the fi rst 
year of opening. The inclusion of 
these services will affect srudents 
for a long time after the original 
openjng." 

EXPOSE 
YOURSELVES! 

The Guardian would like to extend a special oHer to groups who 
might wont to advertise in the campus newspaper but find the 
associated costs prohibitive. 
The Guard ian circulates 22,000 copies to all six campuses each 
week. Our distribution team reports that newspapers are flying 
off the rocks more than ever. Increased readership may be due 
to new marketing efforts, more fuil-color covers, or just improved 
editorial quality. Whatever the reason, we li ke it. And we wont 
campus groups who might be stropped for cosh to be able to 
ride the wove and get some exposure . You can announce events, 
meetings , give props, congratulate a colleague, or recrui t new 
members . All these messages can be yours; almost free l 

Introducing, the 
experimental COUPONS 
FOR AD SPACE PLAN. 
Many Tritons consume 

U C I • GUARDI AN goods and services al l 
over Son Diego, but the 

Guardian (and our client base) likes it when our coupons are 
used . So here's the plan : 
Get your members to save receipts whenever they use Guardian 
coupons. Each receipt will be worth $4 when turned into the Ad 
Mgr. to be exchanged each Thursday for advertising space. Pretty 
simple, huh? Note: Although we can create your ad in a pinch , 
we prefer that you toke core of it. 
By the way, if your members are not wild about Flame Broiler, 
Advanced Body Core, or any of the other coupons found in each 
Monday and Thursday issue, Michael will toke requests for new 
businesses I The idea here is to increase your interaction with our 
newspaper while giving your group some much·needed Visibility. 

SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE PLAN 
The amount you spend on a coupon is irrelevant. Just keep your 
receipt and you will earn $4 toward the cost of any d isplay ad 
up to a half pagel 
Certain receipts will be assigned a higher value. At this time, the 
only $6 value coupons are the real estate ads (where you basically 
need to buy a condo or something, AND Advanced Body Care 
(Thurs Coupon page) where you can get a professional (J -hr.) 
full-body massage right now for $ 25111 
By the way, here Is a sample price list of our ods so that you 

know approx how many coupon receipts you'll need to earn a 
certain ad size. 
2)(3" = $2A (6 receipts) 
4X5" = $aO (20 receipts) 
SX8" = $160 (40 receipts) 
ax 1 0" = $320 (a whole bunch of receipts) 
It might seem like a lot of spending, however, depending on the 
consuming habits of your group, you can build toward a sizable 
ad quicklyl Also, you can pay a little "real" money and use the 
receipt plan for the balance if you wish .

Pick up the pace: 
Local running trails 

By ANNE SPOHR 
Contributing Writer 

Experienced runner often 3)' 
that the first mile is always the 
mo t difficult, but for any rmUler, 
It is preCISely the completion of 
that firs t mile that moti,'a tcs them 
to continue runrung. Those that 
get past the first mile on CSD's 
ca mpu keep going becau e they 
are rewarded with the \I~de variety 
of cenic running trail that sur-
round UCSD. Between Campus 
Loop, C D Park, the cliffs, 
Torrey Pine Glider Porr and 
Black' Beach, there is a running 
trail for e,'ervone, from the most 
lei urcly Jogger to the most com-
petiu"e and pain-seeking runner. 

Perhaps thc mo t popular run-
ning destination on campu is 
Campus Loop, which is the same 
route that the huttles use to trans-
port those who are not a eager to 
run . On any given day, dozen of 
runners can be found pounding the 
pavement around the perimeter of 
campus. This approximately 4.5-
mile loop has changed in distance 
and location due to the recent 
addition of the Eleanor Roosevelt 
College campus, bur still presents a 
challenge for any runner. While 
for the most part the loop casually 
wind its way through the six col-
leges, a challenging hill awaits you 
in either direction. 

Hillary Mills, an Earl Warren 
College senior and co-captain of 
the UCSD Track Team, runs the 
Campus Loop frequently. 

"Campus Loop is a good run 
for someone who doesn 't have 
much time bur still wants a good 
workout," she said. "Overall, it's a 
pretty easy run, but the hill by 

RL\lAC is definitely a challenge." 
Panicipants of the cross-coun-

try, track and master's running pro-
grams can be seen working Out 
gruelIng hill print on tllC lull. 
near Rl.\1AC, while the secoon 01 
the loop from the ilman and 
,\1yers intersection up to the mini-
Stonehenge in Revell e ollege 
offers an equally challenging 
a cent up to the southwest side of 
campus. For most runners, the 
loop takes anywhere from half-an-
hour to 4 - minutes to complete 
and is me perfect run for someone 
who needs a quick workout in 
between a busy class or work 
chedule. 

The eucalyptus grove on the 
ea t side of RL'1AC field , properly 
known as the UCSD Park, is 
another great place to run on cam-
pus. The network of single tracks 
that wind about the edge of the 
canyon between Warren and 
Rl 'lAC field is a great place to get 
off the pavement and into the 
shade of the eucalyptus tress. 

Jake Cohen, a Warren sopho-
more, is one runner who takes 
adva ntage of UCSD Park. 

"1 run there once or twice a 
week" he said. "It's a convenient 
place' for me to run since I live on 
campus. The woods al 0 give me 
the natural setting that I grew up 
with back home in Lake Tahoe. 
Plus, there are some hills in there." 

Both the track and cross-coun-
try teams use the woods to train, as 
well. 

"During faU training we use me 
woods to do interval work as a group 
as weU as run there on our four 
shorr-disrance runs," Mills said.

Talented musician afoot 
Entertainer serenades students with his toes 

By CLARE LEWIS 
Contributing Writer 

On ct. 23, Porters Pub came 
alive to tlle roe-tapping music of 
special musician Mark Coffeney 
during one of its regular open mic 
sessions. Goffeney's pcrformance 
was not only a musical delight but a 
visual spectacle as well, as he played 
the bass guitar with his toes. 

Coffene)" who was born with-
out arms and consequently relies 
entirely upon the strength and fl ex-
ibility of his legs and toes, is truly 
an inspiration - not to mention 
easy ro chat with - partly due to 
his ta lent and partly because of hi 
laid-back personality. 

At Porter's Pub, the musicians 
that played with him loved him. 

"He's great to play with ; such a 
talented musician. 1 ca n't believe he 
has such strong muscles in his 
toes," said Joe Knox, a guitarist and 
senior music majo r at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College. 

There are anoilier four mem-
bers in his musical ensembl e, and 
together iliey make up the band Big 
Toe. The group travels all over 

alifornia, playing at a variety of 
functions and venues. Sometimes 

offeney gives a short presentation 
before he plays, particularl), if he is 
a f,'1.le t at a fwtction, but other 
times he just performs his music to 
tho e that come to hear it. 

"I prefer to play in a regular 
venue when awareness ha ppens 
without saying anything," Coffeney 
said. "There's something grC'dt about 
playing to a whole bunch of people 
JUSt enjo};ng the aon05phere." 

This ycar Big 1(,e hopes to trav-
el to Europe, where Corfeney per-
ceives a ignificant amount of social 
distancing from disahled people. 

In these places there is u a 
grcater class divide where people at 
the lower end of the soc ial spec-
trUltl arc getting shunned," he aid . 

li e explains tha t he doesn't 
enc unter uch indifference here in 
the United tates and has had no 
problem living a norma l life. 

"It's more the older generations 
lhat are lhe problem, in particular 
those over 60, bccau c physical dis-
abillt:ies were more taboo in earlier 
decades. Preside nt Franklin D . 
Roosevelt had to hide his disabili-
tic , caused by polio, so th:lt it 
wouldn't tami h hi appearance as a 
great leader," he said. 

Goffeney explai ned lhat even 
one of his grandmothers automati-
cally assumed that hi mother would 
terminate the pregnancy in 1969-
cven during a period of extreme lib-
eralism - due to his disability. 

offeney visited UC D last 
month at a more formal perfor-
mance a part of the UC D 
Oi abiliry Awarenes Month cele-
bration. T he aware ness month 
focust!s on pro~ding information 
about disabilities to timulatc a bet-
ter understanding and apprecia-
tion. Barry Nimall, the cam pus 
program director and rehabilita-
tion counselor, has been organiz.ing 
thcse events for years and ha 
worked with offeney many times.

ul stopped to listen to him and 
ended up staying half an hour, and 
I almost missed my lecture," Earl 
Warren College senior Joanne 
Mitchell said. 

Goffeney doesn't take long to 
attract a crowd of people around 
lhat soak up the atmosphere. 

Coffcney explains that he is also 
more focused on the musical aspect 
now, and just enjoys playing for a 
lively crowd. Before, speaking about 
disabilities was always a prelude and 
means to perform, whereas now he 
believes that it's not as necessary. 

U It's not necessary to go back to 
basics. Everyone knows all that 
stuff. The performance peaks for 
itself," he said. 

lIe also prefers the informal con-
versations he has after a perfor-
mance where he can relate to the 
students on a one-to-one level. After 
the Price Center performance, 
Mark stayed for over half an hour 
chatti ng to musicians and tudents 
mat seemed interested in asking 
questi ons and sho\l~ng appreciation. 

"l ie was 0 fun to watch -
everyone was amazed by the perfor-
mance and how talented he was. It 
was completely crazy. I didn 't leave 

for ages," said Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior, Lisa Hayward. 

Goffeney has, in fact, managed 
to overcome any setbacks he initial-
ly experienced with h.is disability to 
live a comforuble life. He loves h.is 
lifestyle as a musician and ha three 
children - Elizabeth (age 14), 
Luke (12) and Amanda ( ix). 

He is a single dad and adores 
parenthood, despite finding it 
demanding at times. Although his 
children have not inherited any dis-
abilities, Goffeney claims that they 
do have their father's InU ical talent. 

Goffeney's own childhood was 
more difficult. In kindergarten he 
was sent to a special school and put 
with chi ldren who had all kinds of 
disabilities, including children ,~th 
mental disabilities. 

"1 couldn't relate to them. It 
wasn't long before I ruled the 
place," he aid. 

It was al 0 an educational disad-
vantage for him, as he wasn 't learn-
ing fast enough. rn 1973 the 
Rehabilitation Act was pas ed, 
which aimed to integrate schools 
for disabled children and make 
them much more mainstream. Ot 
only could Goffeney transfer to a 
public school, but he was found ro 
have an exceptional I Q and in Ii rst 
grade was transferred to a gi fted 
school.

THE U D GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10,200) 

Running: Utilize beautiful trails at UCSD 
continued from page 12 

The UCSD Park is also home 
to a par cour e. Throughout the 
woods there are specific stations set 
up to incorporate circuit training 
exercises, such as sit-ups, pull-up 
and push-ups, into your run. These 
trails provide a wide variety of time 
and distance options that fit into 
busy schedules. 

For the runner that is looking to 
get farther from campus but still 
does not have a lot of time, the sin-
gle track loop that runs along the 
cliffs above Black's Beach adds a 
scenic view to campus loop. Once 
on the west side of campus, cut 
across North Torrey Pines Road at 
the intersection with La Jolla 

hores Boulevard. Turn right onto 
La Jolla Farms Road, and then veer 
lefr under the gate and onto the 
single track. This trail winds along 
the edge of the cliff and offers spec-
tacular views of the coastline. From 
this vantage point high up on the 
cliff, you can see the black dots of 
wet-suited surfers in the line-up at 
Black's Beach, and looking north 
toward Torrey Pine State Park, 
the colorful canopies of the 
hangliders and paragliders are visi-

ble as they take advantage of the 
stiff occan breez.e and comc within 
inches of the cliffs. Incorporating 
this with the campus loop will add 
about 15 to 20 minutes to the run . 

For Mills, this is one of her 
favorite runs. 

''It's a perfect place to stop and 
catch your breath, enjoy the view 
and just be off campus for a little 
while," she said . 

Once you decide to leave cam-
pus, the running trail get even 
more scenic and difficult. The 
UCSD Triathlon Team utilizes the 
wide variety of running trails adja-
cent to campus in their year-round 
training program. According to 
team member Jean Schenkkan, the 
team's longest runs take place along 
the coast. 

"On our Sunday long runs we 
run through Torrey Pines to Black's 
Beach and down to La Jolla Shores. 
It takes about an hour and a half, 
maybe more, running at a very slow 
pace, JJ she said. 

VVhile this is an extremely long 
run, there are several shaner ver-
sions that offer the same view and 
difficulty level. One of the most 
challenging runs from campus is a 

loop that starts at RIMAC and 
heads down past the Torrey Pincs 
Glider Port to Black's Bea hand 
then back lip to La Jolla Farms Road 
via the Black's Beach acces road . 

But, the goo<l thing about this 
run is that it startS on a light down-
hill decline 0 that there is more 
time to warm up for the steep uphill 
at the very end. Once you reach thc 
Glider Port, cut across the parking 
lot guard rail to the access trail down 
to Black's Beach. The trail here is 
steep and narrow, so it is a goo<l idea 
to slow down and take time as you 
work down this section of the run. 
Once on the beach , head south 
toward Scripps Pier to the Black's 
Beach access road. To get back, head 
up the access road to La Jolla Farms 
Road. This run takes approximately 
45 minutes at a relatively easy pace. 

o matter what your running 
ability or workout time frame is, 
the running trail around campu 
provide a wide variety of route 
and scenery. For those just starring 
to run, chenkkan leaves some 
advice : "Run with a friend and 
always make sure you still have 
plenty of daylight left when you 
head out." 

Big Toe: Reaching the status of a celebrity 
continued {rom page 13 

"I never had any problems mak-
ing friends. I was even elected 
school pre ident, but the news 
reporters were a little overwhelming 
when I first arrived," Goffeny said. 

Despite his determination to 
appear to have had a normal child-
hood, Goffeney did get involved in 
some televi ed charity work that ele-
vated him to celebrity status. From 
the age of four he was learning to 
read cue cards for television during 
overnight fundraiser and telethons. 

By 16, Goffeney had become too 
old to be a child celebrity and his 
lifestyle of limou ine , flights to Los 
Angeles and extravagant hotels had 
stopped. Although he admits that he 
suffered from feeling downcast like 
many child stars do, he aid he 
a ppreciated the experience. 

"It was good while it lasted," he 
said. "I learned a lot about the how-
biz lifestyle and Hollywood 
phonies." 

People were swarming around 
and cheering at Porter's Pub. Even 

the people at the back of the room 
that couldn't appreciate the visual 
performance experienced the 
ambia nce. 

"We were JUSt standing there 
thinking how great the music was. 
We didn't realize he was playing 
with his feet," aid Revelle College 
junior, Sophie Lebrach. 

lndeed, Goffeney considers his 
feet ro be as vital as hands would be. 
He'll use his magical toes again for 
an upcoming event at Balboa Park 
on Nov. 16.

Price Center Theatre, 7pm 

This documentary profiles surfers and surfing locations all over the world, 
including the monstrous waves of Oahu's North Shore, the Gulf shores of Texas 
(where waves are created by oil supertankers), the ice·cold waters of Ireland, 
Santa Cruz, Costa Rica, the Cortez Banks, Da Nang in Vietnam, the tiny waves 
of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin and the tropics of Rapa Nui. More important 
than the diverse and often spectacular locations and waves, however, are the 
wide range of surfers that are profiled, challenging the stereotypes about the 
surfing counterculture.

SAILING 

On Oct. 25 and ct. 26, the 
UC D sailing te3m played host [0 
the annual Frosh! oph Regatta at 
Mission Bay, and with the winds 
came the sailors. The regatta was 
created to build confidence for and 
give experience to new team mem-
bers. It is an opportunity to com-
pete without disrupting the official 
standings. The varsity and junior 
var ity divisions sailed together 
with a rota 1 of eight races for each 
rotation being held . 

The day dawned on Oct. 25 with 
a trong-northwesterly wind that 
olidified itself as a driving force 

across the bay. Six races were held 
under 9- J3 knot wind and sunshine. 
Oct. 26 brought falling ash and 
moke, allowing only twO races. 

Despite the setback caused by San 
Diego fires and light winds, about 20 
tearns guaranteed a competitive fleet 
\\ith USC taking top honors. 

UCSD placed sixth overall in the 
varsity division, led by varsity B-
skipper Jeff imon with crew Jessica 
Hempstead consistently placing in 
the top of the fleet. The junior varsi-
ty clivi ion saw a personal best from 
skipper John Frank with crew Joanna 
Rauh as they sailed to seventh place 
in the 'B' rotation, just one place 
below the varsity 'B' team. 

This year, UCSD has been able 
to field a women's team at several 

regattas, while most schools are 
able to only muster up coed team. 
Heather Martinelli with Hillary 
Lowe of the women's team ailed to 
13th place in the 'N division. 

The Fro h! oph Regatta often 
sets benchmarks for the rest of the 
year, and this year was no different. 
\Nith only freshmen and sopho-
mores sailing, this set a minimum 
standard for other regattaS involving 
the entire collegiate community. 
The UCSD sailing team has set the 
bar high for itself by howing well 
early in the sea on. The team is now 
looking forward to ovember, when 
they will travel to anta Barbara, 
Calif., to begin their first set of inter-
sectional competitions. 

EQUESTRIAN 
On Oct. 25, the UCSD equestri-

an team competed in the Western 
Show, its first of the season, hosted 
by the Cal Poly Pomona equestrian 
team at the Kellogg Arabian Farm at 
Cal Poly Pomona. UCSO had a 
strong showing, finishing second a 
Reserve Champions with 15 points, 
just lightly behind Mt. an Antonio 
College, which won the Show 
Champion title. 

Sophomore Alicia Cunningham-
Bryant placed second in the 
Intermediate n class. 

"It was a tough round. My horse 
was young and inexperienced, but I 

TilE U D GUARDIAN 

had a good time and I am 
really proud of 

harlcne," unningham-
Bryant said of the compe-
tition and teammate, 
sophomore Charlene Zil. Zil 
took the first-place blue rib-
bon in the Intermediate II 
class. 

Junior Katy Wanner placed 
second in her Walk-Jog class 
while freshman Lindsay 
Minor placed second in the 
Advanced Western 
Horsemanship class. Sophomore 
Heather guyen and junior Lindee 
Hamner both placed fourth in their 
respective Walk-Jog clas es. 

Junior Laura Welter took third in 
Beginning Western Horseman hip. 

"Competing in such an exciting 
horse show was even more thrilling 
with my teammates there cheering 
me on, providing much needed 
support and encouragement," 
Welter said. "1 had an awesome ride 
and I can't wait to show again at the 
next competition." 

The equestrian team's next 
competition will be English Only 
tyle of riding at Cal Poly Pomona 

on ov. I . The first home show for 
UCSD is at the Del Mar Horse 
Park on ov. 15 and Nov. 16. 

SURFING 
On Oct. 26, the current nation-

varsity team placed Sixth overall while the JunIOr varsity learn placed seventh. 

al champion UCSD surf 
team traveled to Vennlra, 

Calif., and took the first step in the 
long journey to defend its champi-
onship crown. Led by a pair of new 
senior captains, Dan Bodul and 
Zach Plopper, the team was excited 
to get back in the surf. 

The day opened under difficult 
conditions, with most of the team's 
members having a tough time with 
the waist- to chest-high "mush-
burgers." But the difficulties could 
do little to hamper the team's tal-
ent, as evidenced by senior Loryn 
Wilson, the 2003 women's national 
title holder. Wilson handily won 
her division, giving the UCSD 
team a much-needed boost. 
Sophomore Nick Statom, another 
title holder, finished third in body-
board, and medical srudent Max 
Hoshino won the short boarding 
division decisively with a total heat 
score of 20 points out of a possible 
20. It i the first time the National 
Scholastic Surfing Association has 
een uch a feat happen all year. 

The UCSO 'N team ended up a 
disappointing third place overall. 
The next event will be at Blacks 
Beach on ov. 22. 

WATERSKIING 
The young ucso water ski 

team finished third in the Western 
Regionals and 12th in its second 
consecutive bid to the ational 
Collegiate Water Ski sociation 
Division I ational 
Champion hip, building their 
reputation a an up-and-coming 
program. 

All-conference junior Peter 
Mehrhof led the Tritons' rlln to the 
third place finish behind Arizona 
State and hico State in the cham-
pionships . Mehrhof posted hi s 
strongest three-event overall per-
formance of his career, tying his 
chool record in , Ialom, running 2 

at 35 off, tricking 1,180 points, and 
smashing the school jump record 
by jumping 112 feel. Mehrhof 
owns all four of the lalom, trick, 
jump and overall school records, a 

M NDAY, NOVEMI~ER 10, 2003 

first in the 15-year history of the 
Triton water ski program. 

The team entered its final 
competition ranked ninth in the 

CWSA Coaches Association 
Poll, with all bllt one starter 

from last year's team com-
peting. The Tritons wok 
a very young but well-
prepared women 5 team, 

led by all-star 
sop homore 

Lindsay Baxter. 'The 
veteran men's 

team was 
compo ed of Jeff 

Orr, Tim Odell and 
David Wiens, joining Mehrhof to 

form a formidable team. 
At nationals, UCSD was over-

whelmed by experienced competi-
tors, but gave a strong performance. 
TIle learn finished seventh in their 
combined trick score, but di mal 
showin!,1'S in iump and laloms landed 
the Tritons in 12th place overall. 

UCSO was joined at the nation-
al championships by cro stown 
rival and training site partner San 
Diego State, which returned to the 
nationals in Division n for the first 
time. in over a decade. With their 
cason over until spring 2004, ·the 

Triton water ski team is now focus-
ing on acquiring a new Ma terCraft 
boat, an addition they hope will 
help build their succe s. 

ICE HOCKEY 
After beginning the sea on with 

two promi ing wins on the road. 
the Triton ice hockey team suffered 
three straight 10 e against cross-
town rival an Diego State. The 
latest game was on ct. 25 at the 
University lownc enter Ice 
Chalet in front of a large and rowdy 
crowd, equally divided between 
UCSD and SDSU fan . 

The Tritons scored first in the 
first period. But UC ' D was unable 
to handle the fast paced and aggres-
sive Aztec offense, giving up three 
goals by the end of the econd peri-
od. UC D goalkeeper onner 
Swanson had sevcral sa\'c , but \\'a 
unable to contend "ith D 'fast 
break opportunities. Anger brewed 
on both ides, especially after the 
Aztecs' aggression left two C 0 
players injured on tllC ICC. 

U D came back early in the 
third period with a quick goal, mak-
ing the game intere ting at 3 -1, 
e pecially since UCSD failed to

COMMENTARV 

Free beer 
and food 

draws over 
1,000 fans 
Bikini contest 
flops at water 
polo match 
By MAITHEW GRANT 

Staff Writer 

Kudos to anyone involved 111 
upgrading the ov. 7 home water 
polo victory over UC Santa 
Barbara into the gala that it was. 
The team not only played an 
exemplary game, but fans were 
invited to a free barbeque before-
hand put on by the fraternities 
and sororities to sip complemen-
tary kegs of Karl Strauss in the 
beer garden. This is the kind of 
support that UCSD needs to reg-

ul~rly boost it lacking crowd 
numbers and energy. 

Additional elements like the 
beer and barbeque are introduced 
to an athletic event, and the relative 
benefits of mending arc increased. 
The energy of that crowd is boost-
ed, thu giving the home team a 
significant home field (pool) advan-
tage. 

'Vhy do we consistently ignore 
the pattern of fan energy produc-
tion at UCSD? Is it asking too 
much to establish a more consis-
tent upbeat atmosphere at sport-
ing events' j 0\'. 7's water polo 
match was an exemplary reason 
for upping the standard at these 
games. 

By 5: 15 p.m., the lawn adjacent 
to Canyonview Pool and the beer 
garden in the SOli thea t corner of 
the pool deck was swarming with 
fan preparing for the game. At 
the same moment that the nation-
al anthem was finished, the kegs 
were ab orbed and the barbeque 
crowd had largely migrated 
toward the game. An immediate 
four-goal lead sparked Triton fans 
into an uncharacteristic roar. 

lembers of the Sunset Club 
tcam, a largely UC 0 grad team, 
lined the front row of the beer 
garden and led boisterous chants 
from their re erved seats. Fans 
appeared intere ted and ignifi-
cantly more in tunc with what was 
occurring in the water than at 
somc of the more COI11 peti ti ve 
matches of the sea on that were 
not equipped with fan-friendly 
services . 

RUlllors circulated before the 
gamc about a bikini conte t 

~chcdu led for halftime, bur it was 
apparcndy called off in the 11th 
hour for unconfirmed rCa on . 
Sure enollgh, halftilll passed and 
the only contest was the one 
where fans have 3 minllte to try to 
land a mini·ball in an il1lertube 
noatlllg in the middle of the pool 
(which nobo Iy could win in two 
rounds). 

There was an effort at redemp-
tion between the third and fourth 
qu rrer~ when a ~ma ll group of 
ladies appeared before the bleach-
er ; however, sOl1le thing was la k-
ing from whJt one might h,lve 
expected of a hlk'l1i contest. 
PerhJP\ It WJ; the conte,tant

Swimming: UCSD hoped to benefit from a D,1 level meet 
conrinued from page 20 

wanted us to swim fast and have a 
good time," UCSD senior co-
captain arolyn Kwok said. "It 
was more of a flln meet for us. It 
was good for us to open our eyes 
and sec the other fast swimmers." 

This meet was special for 
Kwok who had the opportunity 
[0 watch her childhood friend 
Sarah Marshall compete for 
Pacific. 

"I had been swimming in the 
same club team as Sarah since I 
was 13 years old and it was so 
awesome to see her swim," Kwok 
said. "I haven't seen her in a long 
time." 

Although the Tritons lost, the 
teams did have fun swimming 
against Division [ counterparts 
Paci fie. The Ti gers won 16 of the 
20 events, 10 ing to UCSD in 
women's 300-yard breaststroke 
relay, men5 300-yard breastroke 
relay, women's 200-yard freestyle 
relay and the men's 300-yard 
medley relay. 

"We know that University of 
Pacific, being a Division I team is 
a really fast team," Kwok said. 
"Our coaches were shocked at 
how well we did ." 

The UCSD women's 300-
yard breastroke relay team is 
compri ed of freshman Jenna 

Muenter, senior Denise Bogard 
and junior Rosanna Dclurgio. 
These three women won the 
event with a time of 3 minutes, 
19.88 seconds. In addItion, the 
Triton women notched another 
win in the 200-yard freestyle 
relay with a time of 1:37.96, good 
enough to beat the Tigers' lime 
of I :38.56. The UCSD 200-yard 
freestyle relay team comprised of 
freshman Liz Whiteley, 
Dclurgio, Kwok and freshman 
Emily Harlan. 

"We were so excited and 
pumped up when our men's and 
women's tearns won the 300-yard 
breaststroke relay," Kwok said. 
"[The wins) really gOt everyone 
going." 

On the men's side, senior 
Robert Small, junior Brett Going 
and freshman Jacob Dong 
[Ogether won the 300-yard 
breaststroke relay even t wi th a 
time of 2:38.94, nearly two sec-
onds ahead of the Tigers. The 
second UC D win on the men's 
side wa the 300-yard medley 
relay with mall, Going and 
freshman Charlie Rudy who fin-
ished at 2:19.64. 

This meet was UCSD's fir t 
loss, making their record I-I 
going into their Nov. 8 meet 
against rival UC Davis.

The sixth-ranked UCSD men 's 
water polo squad completed its 
home schedule Nov. 7, defeating 
No. 9 UC Santa Barbara 11-6 
before a crowd of 1,061 at 
Canyonview Pool. The team and 
the home crowd bid farewell to 
graduating co-captains Matthew 
Ustaszewski and Matt Ellis. 

Junior driver Brandon Borso 
opened the contest for the Tritons 
after winning the game-starting 
sprint and putting away the first of 
a game-high fou r goals barely one 
minute into the first quarter. Borso 
set the tempo for his team as red-
shirt sophomore hole et Chris 
Finegold, senior co-captain utility 
Usta zewski, and junior utility 
Jonathan Hopkins were all able to 
pound the aucho defense for a 4-
o lead going into the final posses-
sion of the quarter. 

While UCSD sophomore 
goalie Colin McElroy wa a 
seemingly impenetrable force 
throughout the first quarter, 
UC B managed to get itself on 
the board with only three-tenths 
of a second remaining in the 
quarter when junior driver Travis 
Boettner led UCSD's final coun-
terattack in a print toward the 
UCSB goal. 

He was closely double-covered 
by Gaucho defensemen, who were 
able to strip him of McElroy's pas 
and move it back to UCSD's half of 
the tank and into the hands of 
enior Doug Arthur for an 8-meter 

bullet into the upper-right corner 

of the cage. 
The comfortable three-goal dif-

ference grew further in the lritons' 
favor in the second quarter when 
junior driver Clark Peter en rifled 
in a shot past UCSB second-string 
freshman goalie Rick Wright less 
than 90 seconds into play. 

On the next possession, 
Hopkins was awarded his first of 
two four-meter penal ty shots, 
which he converted effortlessly, 
granting the Tritons a 6-1 advan-
tage. 

The Triton defense remained 
powerful through the end of the 
first half. The only lapse occurred 
in the final two minutes on a cros 
pass which drew McElroy from 
the center of the cage to the right 
po t. T he Gaucho wing pump-
faked him twice before sending a 
pas across the face of the goa l for 
the left Wing, fresh man Ros 

inclair, to shoot far Out of 
McElroy'S reach, and leaving the 
core at 6-2 for the halftime 

break. 
U SB entered the p 01 in the 

third quarter like a school of blood-
thirsty harks. In the fir t minute of 
play, the Ga ucho hole defender 
came down hard on IJopkins as he 
drove through the center, fouJing 
Hopkins in dead time and earning 
him a econd four-meter penalty 
shot. Hopkins s ored on the 
opportu111 ty, but that would be the 
la t time in the quarter that U SD 
would be able to beat the aucho 
defense.
