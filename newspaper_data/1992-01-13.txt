• Hike unlikely to be raised by regents; UC 
system will see 1.5% growth in general budget 
By ......... 
Stlnior Staff *iter 

Universicy of California student 
fees will increase by 22 percent next 
year, according to the proposed state 
budget unveiled by Governor Pete 
Wilson on Thursday. 

1be $550 increase will raise the 
average cost of an undergraduate 
year at the UC for state residents to 
$3,036 - over $1,000 per quarter. 

If Wilson's budget is approved 
by the state legislature, the UC will 
receive $2.136 billion next year, an 
increase of 1.5 percent over 1991-
92, but $181 million less than what 
the universicy's regents requested. 

In contrast, last year's budget 
included a $2.2 million cut in fund-
ing from the previous year. 

1be student fee increase will add 
$85 million to the UC budget, but 
only $60 million of that will go 
directly into the system. The re-
maining $25 million will go toward 
increased financial aid for student . 

Allhough the governor's budget 
raises student fees, it does not de-
crease enrollment, as some student 
leaders had feared. In fact, the new 
budget provides for an additional 
1,500 undergraduates and 1,100 
graduate students systemwide. 

1be initial reaction of student 
leaders to the governor's budget 
was generally critical. 

"I'm outraged that the governor 
has ... emptied the students' pock-
ets to balance the budget," said U ni-
versify of California Student Ass0-
ciation (UCSA) President Marisela 
Marquez. "We need a long-term 
funding solution for higher educa-
tion, or the governor will return to 
students, again and again, like a 
thief to a house with no locks on the 
doors." 

According to the UCSA, thi in-
crease will put UC fees at a level 10 
percent higher than at other compa-
rable institutions. 

"It's a misUlke to just look at 
fees, because students are also pay-
ing for food, housing, books and 
transportation," said UCSA Execu-
tive Director Lee Butterfield. He 
said that the UC is now the second 
most expensive school of its type in 
the country, just behind Penn ylva-
nia State University. 

"Our official position i one of 
outrage," said John Edson, UCSA 
vice president and UCSD's UCSA 
representative. "This represent an 
86 percent increase over two years, 
and is the second straight year that 

After enduring a 40 
percent fee increase last 
year, UC undergraduates 
may be getting another fee 
hike. Included in the 
governor's proposed 
California sltlte budget is a 
22 percent 'ncrease in UC 
fees. Here is a look at how 
UC fees have increased 
over the past few years: 

/ 

fees have been rnised more than 10 
percent, in violation of law." 

James CoIIief.G/aJ!iln 

and California State University 
(CSU) systems to 10 percent in any 
gi ven year. But due to other regu la-
tions, neither the govemor nor the 
UC regents have to follow that law. 

The Long-Term Student Fee 
Policy (SB 1645), igned by Gover-
nor George Deukmejian in Sept. 
1990, restricts the amount that tu-
dent fees may increase in the UC

Directory Usting 
Umited for Safe 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Associate News Editor 

Citing a concern for the security and privacy of 
students, university officials have limited the student 
Ii tings in the current UCSD Telephone Directory to 
include only names and phone number . 

In the past, student Ii tings have also included the 
studel1t's major, year, and permanent and local ad-
dresses. 

Associate Registrar and Admis ions Officer Sally 
Hickok-Broxton explained that the Registrar's Of-
fice made the decision because the information pub-
lished in the directory may be used for junk mailings 
or to place students in personal danger. 

"Too often students are exposed to a nuisance ... to 
the extent that [Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs Joseph Watson] wasconcemedabout it," said 
Nick Aguilar, director of Special Services, who orga-
nized an informal advisory committee on Watson 's 
request.

Unpubllclzed Lab Regulation Leads to Grading Surprises 
By -.ry a.ttr ...... 
News Editor 

Last quarter, Scott Kush, a Warren CoUege 
senior,gotadistwbing surprise on his transcript. 
Even though he had dropped his Chemistry 
Laboraaory 143A on Oct. 14, well within the 
regiIInIr's deadline, he nuived a "W" for the 
class. 

"I [telephone registemlJ for the class, but I 
never showed up," Ka.h said. "On Nov. 27, the 
rqisnr's [office) went back and altered my 
IrIOICript. Jiving me no notifICation ... [the 
reptnr's offICe) went back and ~added me, 
IIId cbopped me, sivina me a ·W' ... 

TOcMnaeIbeMW" JAde, Kush said. he must 

petition his college's provost. "I turned in the 
petition ... to remove the ~·W" ... on Jan. 7 to the 
Warren Provost's Office. It is to be debated 
among the provosts [and] I will get the decision 
some time during second week." 

What Kush and other students have experi-
enced isanamendment to regulation 500-0 of the 
Academic Senate's Policy and Procedures 
Manual, which was passed by the Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP), and approved by the 
Academic Senate on April 23, 1991. 

Biology Professor Douglas Smith, the current 
chair of the CEP, described the amendment as a 
"general grading policy affecting laboratories" 
for all departments with laboralory courses. 

According to Debbie Ohagan, a program rep-
resentative for the Department of Chemistry, the 
amendment states that students who drop any 
laboratory after the second session of class would 
receive a "W." 

Ohagan added that the Winter Quarter 1992 
schedule incorrectly states that a tudent will 
receive a "W' if the laboratory class is not 
dropped before the end of the second week of 
class, not the second meeting. 

According to Ohagan, the chemi try depart-
ment has decided to allow students to wait until 
the second week. since it can be difficult to drop 
a class in the fll'St week. "We an:: giving leeway,"

The prop<l6Cd university budget 
also includes a fourpercem increase 
for inflationary items, $30 million 
for instructional equipment and

Ibree studenIS nominated by the 
University of California SlUdent 
AIsociation (UCSA) forthe posi-
tion of studeni regenL 

Alex WOOS, a 1990 graduate 
ofTbiid College, WM chosen by 
a group of undergraduale and 
graduate represeotarives from all 
ofabe UC~ 81 the UCSA 
meeting 81 UCLA on Saturday. 

Wong, now a student at UC 
Berkeley's Boalt UlW School, 
served as UCSD Associalcd Stu-
dents (A.S.) Vice President Ex-

Inearly 1991 , Wilson's proposed 
20 percent student fee increase was 
followed in February by the UC 
Board of Regents' anoouncement 
thai student fees would actually in-
aase by 40 percent. 

Buttbis year,accordingtoEdson, 
there will be nodoublc-whammy of 
fee increases. 

"The governor will present his 
budget 10 the regents next weekend 
at UC Davis." Edson said. "But 
unlike previous years, this budget 
will be adopted out of band." 

Edson said this unusual chain of 
events is due to an IIBMCment be-
tween Wilson and outgoing UC 
President David Gardner. He said 
thai Gardner warted closely with 
Wilson's budget director to c~ a 
UC blJdset that would beacceptable 
to both the governor and the uc. 

"We can thank David Gardner 
for the fact thai we got extra money 

temal in 1989-90. 
The other two nominees, 

wbose names will be forwarded 
with WOOS's for consideration 
by rbe UC Board of Regents and 
GovcmorPae Wilson. are UnA 
sociology graduate student Emil 
Volcbcck and UC Berkeley un-
dergraduate Robert Swcedlow. 

FonncrUCSDA.S. Vice~i­
dent Administrative Ru~n 
Dwan, one of the 'throe student 
regent nominees last year, did not 
advance tolbis year's fmal round. 

"We're fortWJate to have a 
UCSD alumnus as one of the fi-
nalists," said UCSA Vice Presi-

from the state," Edson said. "He 
was responsible for keeping the fee 
increase lower than it could have 
been," 

In addition to his dealings with 
the governor's oftice regarding stu-
dent fees, Gardner presided over 
cuts close to home: the new budget 
slices $6.5 million out of the budget 
for the Office of the President. 

One major point of negotiation 
between UC students, Gardner and 
Wilson's office involved the ques-
tion of what to call the more than 
$3,036 that in-state students will 
pay each year. 

Officially, when students begin 
to pay for instruction, student"fccs" 
are defined as or termed as "tu-
ition. " 

Instead of changing the name to 
"tuition,"which would give the state 
the ability to redirect those funds 
elsewhere, the UC budget was a1-

tered so that student fees pay for 
libraries, while money slated to go 
toward libraries would instead go 
toward the cost of illSlJUCtion. 

Future Student Efforts 
Student leaders plan to use sev-

eral different methods to fight fee 
increases now and in the future. The 
UCSAexecutiveboardpians tomcet 
with CalifomiaState University stu-
dents and organize a series of joint 
lobbying effons at the state capitol. 

As for the future, Edson said he 
hoped that students would join to-
gether and increase "public aware-
ness in the plight of students." 

"Last year [after the 40 percent 
increase], the legislature didn't 
gauge a high enough level of con-
cern among students. If Ihat keeps 
happening, the legislature will gain 
theconfidence to increase fees more 
and more, while thinking that they're 
not huning students."

UC TUITION 

New Fee Hike Isa Bad Quick Ax 
The proposed 1992-93 California stale budget is out, and the 

news is not good for UC students. Governor Pete Wilson, in an 
anempc to fill the bottomless pit that the state budget deficit has 
become, is asking students to pay an additional 24 percent. or $550, 
in fees next year. The proposed increase. if implemented. would 
raise tuition COSIS to $3,036 per year, well over $1,000 perquaner. 

Wilson's budget proposal is an ilI<OnCeived quick fix which 
couldn't come at a wo~ time for many Californians. Wilson seems 
to believc that he can have his caltc andCIII it, too; that he can balance 
the StalC'S budget in the middle of a stagnating recession and at the 
same time increase spending. 

The 1992-93 budget plan is the mutant offspring of last year's, in 
which residents were pummeled by over $7 billion in new taxes, 
while the budgel grew by 10 percenl The result became clear soon 
enough: the $7 biUion in taxes went to pay for the new spending. and 
the Stale still found itself 53 billion in the red. 

The proposed 24 percent fee increase follows a 4.4 percent 
growth in the UC's budget The university will be receiving $ I 19.9 
million more this fiscal year. About $17.2 million will be directed 
toward raising enrollment by an additional 2, 700 full-time students. 
Most of it. however, will be directed toward faculty salaries, 
maintenance costs and other on-going projects. 

Inevitably, this new fee increase will take its toll on an already 
overburdened studrnI body. Thousands of students may be forad 10 
choose a Jesser oducabon. or no education at all, because of rising costs.. 
According 10 the proposal. "10 1XlI11pC11S11fe for the fee increase, UC will 
provide 5 19.3 million in additional financial aid to insure that no scudeIIl 
is denied access 10 UC as a rcsull of the fee increase. .. 

However. as many middle-incomc families are aware. thecurrenl 
financial aid sySftm is often insufficienL Many students fall into a 
"limbo" category: their family's amual income is often too high to 
qualify for aid, but insufficient to pay for four years of college. 

The Wilson proposal ispanicularty skewedbccauscitnegJectstotake 
into ~additional expenses incumd which are necessarily a pari of 
college educabon. Housing, food, Ir'ampOdIIlion and clothing play a 
critical role in planning a studenl'S budget Thus, when the state tries to 
placate the affected student population by assuring them that the UC's 
$3,036 annual fee is still a pretty good deal, many financially strapped 
students will hear it for what it really is: book. 

Instead of fmding quick fixes and sucldng more money away 
from the nearly-empty wallets of students, the Governor needs to 
come up with a long-term budget plan. A spending freeze would be 
a good start. Cutting back on large-scale stale bureaucracies would 
be another good step, Raising fees year after year is nol only short-
sighted and flllslIating in the here and now, but it is also potcntially 
disastrous for the fUlureofthe University of Cali fomi a, and the many 
students who will lose out on the opponunities a higher education 
can provide simply because the price is far OUI of their reach. 

ADD-DROP POLICY 

"W" Stands for Weasel 
When Scott Kush dropped his chemistry lab at the end of third week. 

last quarter, he thoughl he Wouldn'l have 10 think about it ever again. He 
decided early on that he was going to drop the class. so he stopped 
attending. But when Kush's gnKIes arrivedatlheend of the quarter, he 
was inforan unpleasant swprise. Next tothatchem Jabbedropped weeks 
earlier was a "W." Surely there must have been some mistake. He 
dropped the class before the fourth week deadline, dido'l he? 

Hedid. Buturdera new policy JmSed April 23. 1991 bylheAcademic 
Senate at the behest of the Olemistty Depuunent. anyone who fails to 
atterxI the first two weeks of lab will be automalically dropped lD1 given 
a "W" grade. The problem? The Academic Senate and the Olemistry 
Depnnment never bothered 10 infunn the students of this new policy. In 
foct. the policy did not make it irto the Fall Quaner schedule of classes. 
Students had virtually no way of knowing the policy existed. In Kush's 
case, the univessity IMI1I'OIJed him in the Iabcoursenfterthedeadline. then 

~ him, leaving him with the "W" on 1m transcript 
The univessity has been incredibly sloppy and pedlaps a bil wxIer· 

handed in this matter. While it has taken steps to ClOI'reCI the transcripts 
of students who may have received a "W," this whole episode should 
never have occwred in the fU'S1 place. The next time the Wliversity 
decides to implement a new policy, it should at least have the 001.1 1011 
courtesy to make sure the affected p&rties are informed.

The origin of this most recent cootro-
vCR}' is jl(eIly clear cul 1U about 10 
years. Groundwork was operaIina witbout 
proper in&urance covcnae. Ultimately, if 
anydling happened to its employees. the 
university wu liabJc. Of coune, the wn-
venily had the usual litany ofWorknwl's 
insurance, but it only applied to those who 
were on its payron. Groundwork was pay-
ing its employees, for Ihc most part. out of 
IhctilL But being astudemorganizalion, if 
anything happened to an employee, tbe 
university was rcsponsible. 

However, since Groundwort employ-
ees wen: not on the university'S payroll. its 
insurance would not cov~rdamage to em-
ployees. Any lost lawsuits would be paid 
directly out of the university's pocket. 

This was the university'S main COIl-
cern. I believe, however, Ihcre were some 
other reasons beblnd the university'S de-
sire to get Groundwor1c on the books. For 
some time the university was harboring 
suspicions about Groundwork. Zero-in-
tcrest loans, payments under the table, 
non-studenl employees and even non-stu-
dentcontrolof~work wen; some of 
the university'S fears. 

Moreover, if Groundwork was ever 
audited by the IRS, the ul).iversity would

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

The Right to Hate is Not SO Valuable or Noble 
Editor: 

This letter is in response to the 
conunentary entitled ''The Right to 
Hate is Important" by Tunothy Maeg 
(Ian. 9). 

After I was left peechJess 81 the 
end of thi article, I turned to the 
begirming to notethe author's name. 
I wasn't urprised 10 find arnale first 
name and an Anglo surname. 'The 
author has probably never been ver-
bally altackedon his way to school, 
never had a brick thrown into his 
window because his family was the 
new minority on the block,and never 
experienced a near-total phy ical 
assault by a group of men that be-
lieve the whitenes of their skin i 
enough to prove uperiority. 

I havetowonderwhytherighlto 
hate is so importanllo the author of 
this commentary. He asserts that 
hate is inevitable, but how can he 
overlook the devastating effects of 
acting upon this emotion. Making 
hate acceptable is the reason why in 
Los Angeles in 1991,550 incidents 
ofhate-n:lated crime wen: n:ported 
(Los Angeles County Commission 
on Hate Relations). I suppose if the 
author has issues of his own that 
need some form cf outlet. lie i 

entitled to cope in the way that he 
knows how, but his right to express 
these feelings stops when he sense-
lessly attacks me, someone he 
doesn't even know. 

He accuses UCSD of"indoctri-
naring" students by offering mon: 
ethnic studies classes, but reaUy, 
the university i giving students a 
choice. If he can choose to study 
Western cultun:, why can't I have a 
choice too? Or do I have to be 
"indoctrinated" into believing that 
the "West is Best''? 

'The author encourages politi-
cally corn:ct groups to put mon: 
effort into understanding the domi-
nant white cultun:. Since the birth 
of this country, however, we have 
focused on the great White Race 
and repeatedly overlooked the con-
tributions from other cultures. We 
are not going to continue depriving 
these cultures of the cn:dit they 
deserve. 

He also urges minority groups 
to get their acts together like the 
Asian-Americans have. The uc-
cess of Asian-Americans, if you 
choose to believe in thi Model 
Minority myth, is due in large part 
to Asian-Americans' willingness to

Heatth Care 
Not Impossible 
Editor: 

It is always inspiring when a new 
year comes around, and the firsl 
GlUJrdian then:of proudly hines 
forth with a fresh, renewed inepti-
tude in its editorial staff that reaches 
out even beyond the megalomania-

cal extravagances of Zachary 
Bemwt to touch blossoming igno-
ramusessuchas Matthew Robinson. 
If I may be blunt, the wedge of 
Swiss cheese 'bought last night has 
less holes than Robinson's editorial 
denouncing publicly funded health 
care, "lead Us Not into National 
Health Insurance," (Jan. 6). 

Mr. Robinson would have u 
think it 'sokay that 84 miUion Ameri-
cans lack adequate health insurance 
coverage due to financial or medi-
cal considerations (i.e. insurance 
companies refusing coverage to 
someone who has had a heart attack, 
etc.). After all, we have the most 
lithoptripsy units (used for 
non urgical removal of kidney 
stones from rich people). 

Furthennon:, Robinson seems to 
think thai our abundanceoftechnol-
ogy suffices to make the world "ef-
ficient," an apt description of a sys-
tem in which as much as 40 cenlS of 
every health care dollar goes to sus-
tain large office staffs, collection 
agencies and other administrative 
overhead that could be dramatically 
reduced by having all payments 
come from a single source. In fact, 
a study performed by the General 

Accounting OffICe of the United 
States revealed that a health care 
system modeled after Canada' 
would save enough money to insure 
all 84 million uninsured Americans, 
whileCOSling no more than what we 
are already spending on health care. 

Such a system would never magi-
cally cure all of America's medical 
woes; it would merely be a practical 
solution. It wouldn't be fn:e,aclaim 
Robinson wrongly attributes to the 
y tern's supporters. The same 

money we now give to private in-
sun:rs would simply go to a differ-
ent destination, with a n:sulting in-
crease in the ystem's efficiency. 

Here in America those who can't 
afford surgery are also forced to wail, 
but without n:gard for the possibility 
that their lives may be at stake. The 
n:sult in many cases: death. 

Health care needs to become a 
righc for all Americans, rather than a 
priviJegeofthe wealthy. Anyooenot 
yet convinced that a universal health 
QR system is feasible for the United 
Stalies should realize that this '.~

reporters I have met. 

You can't p~ everyone all the 
time, though. Last year, I wrote a story 
on the Young Americans for Free-
dom, an ultra-conservative group 
whose anti-racial quota<; flyers had 
beenn:rnoved. They felt oppresscd, or 
so they said, and those who removed 
the flyers felt they wen: untruthful and 
harmful. 

I felt I represented both diametri-

however, it's not a tenibly original 
one. Others far more knowledgeable 
and eloquent than I have written such 
diatribes. Perhaps you've read one. I 
hope you have. It wouldmakeme feel

viously, I'm not a conservative. 
In that case, one of the complaints 

was that the view expressed by the 
flyers was racist and therefore should 
not be expressedat all.lncasesof clear 
racism, the racist viewpoint is never

to do is to use a student W1dergradu-

Ohagan said that students who 
dropped between the second and 
fourth week of last quarter but did 
not know about the policy have a 
legitimate complaint, and that the 
petitions of such students "are being 
rubber-stamped" by the chemistry

whether a student petitioning for a

must drop classes by the end of the

DEMOCRATS 
ContInued fnIm .... 4 
debates among the Democratic can-
didates last December 16 saw an 
appalling display of cheap politick-
ing and petty quarrels. There was 
former California Governor Jeny 
Brown trying to pass himself off as 
an anti-establishrnenl insurgent, 
looking more like a jaded used car 
salesman, hawking his 1-800 nurn-
beras moderalorTon\Brok;lw stood 
in indignation. It seemed as though 
everytimeBrownopenMhismoudl, 
he gave his damned phone number! 
When Brokaw tried to cut Brown 
off, the fonner governor cried "0p-
pression." 

"Don 'tcensor," Browncried. wip-
ing the beads ofswcst from his fevered 
brow. "This is the FIrst Arneudmeut! 
These airwaves belong to the people. 
Let them judge whether it's appropri-
ate or not .•• And if you think it's 
inappropriate, then you make that 
jlJdgcrncn. But thai (sic) is not for a 
media outlet to censor a presidenlial 
debate." 

"It was not censorship at all," 
Brokaw replied. "It was in the issue 
of fairness to everyone here tonight. 

This is an attempt to discu the 
issues, not to solicit or raise money." 

Then there was Nebraska Senaror 
Bob Kerrey, a one-issue candidale if 
theteeverwasone, whohasneverthe-
less managed to aItJlICt an obscene 
amount of media attention. There 
Kcmy sal, extolling the virtues of 
socialized medicine as an answer to 
all of America's problems. 

So far, the Kerrey campaign has 
consisted mostly of emphasizing 
(over and over and over ... ) the 
senator's panicipation in the Viet-
namWar,inwhichhelostpanofhis 
leg and won a Congressional Medal 
of Honor. His personal history ,along 
with his commitment to socialized 
medicine, is pretty much all Kerrey 
hall to offe.r. As Sidney Blunknthal 
pulitintheNewRtpublic. "Kerrey's 
campaign is not about' ideology' -
it's about biography." Kerrey's 
perfomanCe during the debate cer-
tainly reflected thaI. 

There was the millionaire Sena-
tor from Iowa, Tom Harkin, decry-
ingtheelilistGeorgeHerben Walker 
Bush as "out of touch," and unable 
to ''understand ordinary hard-work-
ing Americans." Harkin is the great 
liberal hope. Next to Brown, he is 

The UCSD Guardian 

the most progressive of the bunch: 
an anti-establishment, anti-elitist 
politician who speaks from the gut .. 
and shoots from the hip. 

'There was Virginia Governor 
Douglas Wilder - woo dropped 
out of the race just last week - who 
spokeeloquentlyofhisdifficultpast 
and his successes at home, and yet 
seemed to lack the energy and sin-
cerity. There was some speculation 
that Wilder was trying to jockey for 
the number-two position on the 
Democnslic tickel, but that is pretty 
much out of the question now. 

'There was one-time Massachu-
setts Senator Paul Tsoogas. accus-
ing his comrades of various sins and 
other improprieties, such as laking 
money front political action comL 
mirtees and whoring themselves to 
the establishment. Harkin, for ex-
ample, is one of the worst offenders, 
taking millions of dollars from Big 
Labor. The message wasn't so bad. 
1be messenger, however, was dread-
fully dull and-much to lhedismay 
of his audience - terribly whiney. 
Still, Tsongas made his point and 
threw the whole group into an up-
roar when he proposed that they all 
pledge to stop taking PAC money. 

'TheissueofPACcampaigncon-
tributions was a pal1icularty sensi-
tive one. Brown. who has made a 
point of telling everyone who will 
listen that he will not take contribu-
tions in excessof$IOO. managed to 
offend the sensibilities of an indig-
nantKerrey, who finally confronted 
Brown on the i ue. 

"I resent all this PAC and all this 
special interest stuff that you're put-
ling out because you seem to be 
saying that I'm bought and paid 
for," Kerrey said. "[s that what 
you're saying? Are you saying that 
I'm bought and paid for?" 

"I am saying that you are part of 
a system that is bought and paid 
for." Brown replied. adding. "I have 
been pal1 of it." 

Only a politician like Jeny 
Brown can take a legitimate issue 
likecampaign contributions and tum 
it into a joke. If this trend contin-
ues, Brown could actually make 
taking PAC money popularagain. 

And finally. there was Arkansas 
Governor Bill Ointon. now consid-
ered by most pundits to be the Demo-
crats' front-runner, grinning like a 
televangelist. and sounding like (of 
all things) a Republican. Of all the 

• 

OPINION 9 

the candidates, Ointon is consid-
ered the most moderate. He pressed 
his rather suspicious message of 
"bringing America together." 

"We're going up or down to-
gether," Ointon said in his opening 
statement. 

Ointon's moderate stance could 
cause Bushthemostdiftkulty, but it is 
still too early to lell. Based on what we 
know from the debate and news re-
ports, Ointon is the least mediocre of 
thefiveremaining Democnsts. Should 
he actually win the party's nomina-
tion. he will appeal strongly to disen-
chanted Republicans. 

Butwhatofthe Democrats? Until 
as late as last week, the candidates 
have been too busy tearing away at 
each other to be bothered with 
George Bu h. lt w~ only after Bush 
was publicly wounded did they 
bother to fire their shots. Bu h is 
weakernowrnore than ever, and the 
Democrats will do their best to see

THE PHILOSOPHY OF mSTOKY 
This course will exanine the geneaJogy of Western thinking about the meaning of the 
historical world through a careful analysis of key texts from Greco-Roman to contemporary 
tines. In doing so we wil consider the question of whether Western historical thought is as 
"Euro-centric" as some critics have recently charged, and if so, can anything be done about it.

FAVORITES: As always, don't expect 
the U.S. 10 emetJe as the big medal winner. 
As usual. the counaies thai will be the big 
winners are places like Scandinavia and 
Greenland where it snows so much evtrj day 
thai peopJe there don't know about the sun. 

NEW EVENTS: This year there will be 
several evenrsmakins theirdebutsas demon-
stration sports. There will be no medals 
awarded.wbich is a shame, since the U.S. 
would be a sure bet 10' sweep the 4pres-ski 
hot-tubbing finals. 

Also showing up for the first time this 
ye. will be the aforementioned snowshoe 
sprints. 

Competitions to be held in the I~meccr, 
~metcr and 1600-meter distances. The 
\atrer will kick off on the 9th and finish by the 
11th. 

Also new for '92 are the Aexible-Ayer 
slalom and downhill cubing events, although 
finding a golf ~ without secwity guards 
for the cubing has been difficulL 

In addition to the nonnaI ski jump, there 
will also be a wipe-out-at~boUom-of-the­
ramp-and-bounce-off-lhe-ground-as-pain-
fully-looIcing-as-possibJe competition. 

Some of the bigest changes. howe*r, 
are not the addition of new evenlS but modi-
flCalion of the old. 

At the insistence of CBS executives wor-
ried ibou' keeping their audience, Olympic 
planners have clwlged some of the rules of a 
fewevenlS. 

For starters there is the biathlon. This is 
the event that combines two "sports" so 
boring, you woo', even see them on "Wide 
World of Sports," cross-counuy skiing and 
shooting. In an effort to make it a little more 
intereslins. the competitors win DOW be shoot-
ing Bleachother' instead ofliale gI&u targets. 

Bobsledding will see some chanp too, 
with the addition of loops and cortsaews to . , 
the uack. The luge Nn now features jumps 
over the spectaIOr area. 

Figure skaters will be chased by the 
Zamboni, while speed skating will become 
fuJI conlaCt. 

And, finally, ski jumpers will DOW be 
wearing only one ski. 

My pmJictions for the outcome? 
I don't know who's going to win. butI'm 

pretty sure there will be snow on the ground. 
brotherhood and good will f~ all men and 
women, intense competition between ath-
letes striving for their COURtly'S slory. 

And I know there will be a 1V report 
about eating snails. 

Join a winning team.

Eagles Ry by 
Tritons 72-61 
• Offense can't match 
defensive effort; both 
teams only shoot 36% 
from the floor 
By ana Wrenn 
Assocla~ SportS Editor 

If you just look 111 the score, the 
UCSD women's t.sketball team's 
loss to Christ College of Irvine on 
Thursday might not look like a great 
defensive effort. Butdespite the 72-
61 score, Triton Head Coach Judy 
MaJone emphasized the team's de-
fense. 

"I feel we played a good defen-
sive game. Christ College is a very 
good team, and we played them 
well even though we lost." she said 
of her team, now 6-5 on the year. 

Malone's primary concern go-
ing into the game lay in the Eagles' 
offensive fu-epower. Featuring a 
Loyola Marymount style offense, 
ChristCollege lives by the fast break. 
"They like to run the brea1c and then 
pull up quick for the three pointer," 
MaIOne explained before the game. 
"They've got three really good out-
side shooters who can jusl bomb 
you from the three-point line." 

So the Tritons' main goal defen-
sively was to stop the break and 
cover those outside shots. "We did 
that pmty weU,"she said. "They 
had a few baskets off the break, but 
seneraUy we were able 10 stop it" 

ThIl put tile Eagles in a spot 
where they had 10 run a haIf~ 
offense and try toplay inside. UCSD 
was able to get Cel's post p~yers 
into foul trouble early. 

Unfonwwely for the Tritons' 
offensive cause, they lost Erica 
Scholl to a sprained ankle. 'rnw 
really hwtour post play, to lose her -
like that," Malone said 

Lisa Beaver led the Tritons with 
16 points. Cari Young, in her sec-
ond game back following knee sur-
gery, added 13 points. 

However, both Beaver and 
Young played the last few minutes 
with four fouls, limiting tlleir con-
tributions near the end of tile game. 

Stacy Kirch threw in 15 points 
for Christ College, now 11-2 on the 
year. 

Both teams were limited 10 just 
36 percent shooting, a fact Malone 
says had to do more with good do-
fensive play rather than poor of-
fense. '1t was a tough game. We 
both played good defense, tile only 
difference was thal they wece able 
to put up more shots. Otherwise the 
game was even."

Wi1b 1: 10 remainina in die tint 
half, UCSO's Rick BID stole abe 
bell and fed Dervin Jackson. who 
drove the IenJIh of the court before 
dishing to Joey Drake whoslammed 
it home. 

The play seemed to all but put 
the game away early for UCSD, 
which went on to take a 38-24 farst-
half lead. 

The Tritons came out in the sec-
ond half and returned to their old 
habits as they pounded the ball in-
side the paint. 

UCSO's inside game, combined 
with some good outside shooting 
helped squash any of the Penguins' 
attempts to get back in the contest 
Dominican wasn't helping itself ei-
ther as it continued to miss easy 
shots inside. 

The taller Tritons had little 
trouble pulling down the rebounds 
and converting on the other end of 
thecowt. 

UCSOpul1ed down 34 rebounds 
defensively and grabbed !l8 total

"EYeD iDapme like Ibis. it's still 
important 10 keepyourmearaJ focus 
and know what you want 10 do," he 
said. "You have 10 seu game plan 
and stay with thar plan regardless of 
how the other team plays. Some-
times that's very diffICult" 

YetMarshalI wasgrareful forthe 
easy game and the break in UCSD' s 
schedule. "We've had five games in 
eight days," he said. "We needed a 
game like this ... we needed to have 
agamc where we weren't facing the 
intense pressure thai we've gotten 
from some other [learns]." 

With the TrilOns fmnly in con-
trol, Marshall went to his bench, 
which was able to maintain the lead 
and give UCSO an easy Division m 
win. 

Chris Moore led the Tritons with 
14 points, while Ban and Gibson 
Arnold each had 12.

OVER 
TIME 

Olympics '92: Ice, 
Snow, and Snails 

Well, it's that kind of year again. 
Another presidential election, an-
other Leap Day and, yes, another 
Olympics. The Winter and Sum-
merOlympics, supposedly the great-
est display of worldwide amateur 
athletic prowess and sportsmanship. 
Worldwide ports manship, at least, 
between the fow- or five countries 
that aren't boycotting. 

These Olympic events promise 
to be special ones, though. nus is 
the last year that the Summer and 
Wjnter Olympics will be held dur-
ing the same year. 

Beginning in 1994 with the Win-
ler Games, the two Olympics will 
be held in different years. An easy 
way torememberwhichone i which 
is that if there is an extra day in 
February or a Democrat is not mak-
ing it to the White House, it' the 
Summer Olympics. 

Seeingas how the WinterOlym-
pics begin in less than a month, Feb. 
8, here are a few quick Olympic 
fact to help make your viewing 
easier. 

WHERE: TIle Winter Olym-
pics are scheduled to take place in 
the town of Albertville, France. L0-
cated in ome remote corner of 
France, Albertville is a perfect site 
for the G:\mes mainly because it 
was the . ite with the easiest name to 
pronounce (ALBERT-ville or, as 
the French say, Le ALBERT-ville). 

Six years ago when the sites 
were selected, Albertville' scornpe-

Division I Teams too Much for Tritons 
-The UCSD men's 
volleyball team drops 
to 0-2 on the season 
losing to Pepperdine 
and UCLA 
ByCIIIIsR ...... 
AsSOCiate Sports Editor 

When you consider the two op-
ponents that the UCSD men's vol-
leyball team opened their season 
against this past weekend, you'll 
find it easier to stomach the Triton 
0-2 start. 

Friday, UCSD ventured to beau-
tiful Malibu to take on fifth-ranked 
Pepperdine. After UCSD jumped 
out to a promising 3-1 lead in the 
opening game, the Wavescameal ive 
and drowned the Triton 15-S,IS- I, 
15-12. 

Although UCSD lost in three 
straight to the Wave, there were 
some bright spots. Junior Lamson 
Lam had 15 kill ,and junior Brent 
Couture added six more. Defen-
sively, Couture hOO four digs and 
four blocks, and sophomore Matt 
Brigham had three blocks. 

Freshman Tyson Kerr also had 
three blocks. 

For Pepperdine, Tom Sorenson 
had 18 kill . Alon Grinberg added 
10 kills. 

On the defensive side, Sorenson 
and Grinberg each had five blocks. 
Ian Clark added three kills. 

First year UCSD Head Coach 
Rod Wilde, who was a member of 
the 1984 U.S. Olympic team before 
breaking a leg, was pleased with his ' 
team's opening game. 

"We played very well at 
Pepperdine, particularly at the be-
ginning," Wilde said. 

Although Wilde, who is still a 
technical assistant to the U.S. na-

Despite Lamson Lam's 15 kills, UCSD came up short against Pepperdine 15-5,15-1, 
tjonalteam, was happy with Lam' 
15 kills in the game against the 
Waves, he stressed the need to spread 
the offense around. 

"We're trying to balance out the 
attack," Wilde said. . 

Saturday, the Tritons headed 
back south to battle the second-
ranked Bruins of UCLA. 

1be result was not much differ-
ent as the Bruins dropped UCSD 
IS-6, IS-2, IS-6. 

Wilde thinks that one of the Tri-
tons' strengths is their passing. Be-
ing able to pass well will allow 
UCSD to take advantage of the 
middle of the court. 

"We pass pretty welL.and this 
allows us to use the middle," Wilde 
explained. 

Utilizing the middle of the coon 
is important as it will give the Tri-
tons an additiona1 offensive weapon. 

While UCSD used the middle 
with some degree of effectiveness 
against Pepperdine, il did not have 
much success against UCLA. 

"We hit fairly well in the middle 
against Pepperdine, but not against 
UCLA," Wilde said. 

One of the reasons that the Tri-
tons have a strong passing game is 
their depth at the setter position. 
UCSD has five solid seners in Man 
Brega. Taylor Smith, Jay Warren, 
Eric Stanger, and Marmaduke 
Kilpatrick. 

So far Brega seems to be the 
leader in the pack. 

"Man [Brega] has established 

himselfastheprimarysener,"Wilde 
said. 

Wilde also focused on ~ need 
to play consistently. He explained 
how UCSD had bursts when it 
would play very impressively but 
then fall into lulls which allowed the 
Waves and the Bruins to take the 
momentum and put the Tritons 
away. 

"We need to go out each time 
and play at aconsistentlevel,"Wilde 
said. 

Wilde has set two primary goals 
for the Tritons this year. 

1be first is to beat two Division 
I schools. 

The second is to get into the 
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association.

art, not

What is the UCSD 

academic dance minor? 
BY ROBERTO BACALSKI , CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

O nJuly 1,1991, the UCSD Theater Department began something new. 1be dance 
program, previously offered by 
the Physical Education Depart-
ment, was given a home in 
'Theater, raising it to the status of 
an academic, rather than athletic, 
program. 

And the re ponse has been a 
IinJe more than enthusiastic. 

"Great! Wonderful! Marvel-
ous!" says MargaretMarshall, 
program founder and coordinator. 
"The students want more." 

There was a degree of concern 
in the beginning with regard to the 
transition from a PE class worth 
half a unit to a full academic 
course worth two to four units. 

"'They wanted to know how 
different it was, and how much 
they had to do to achieve good 
grades. It wasn't difficult to accept 
the transition," Marshall says. 

The program is one of the 
fastest growing programs on 
campus. "In the PE department, it 
continually grew," Marshall says. 
"I can sec it becoming a popular 
program." 

Students of all levels and 
majors have been and are taking 
the courses, which are open to all 
students. Everyone - from 
1beater majors to prc-mcd 
students - is taking advantage of 
the experience the program offers 
and the academic credit finally 
available. 

"When [ first started, it was in 
the PE department," says Man 
Stem, a Third College sophomore 
with a double major in Theater 
and Communication. "[ was 
getting half a unit and loving it. 
I'm definitely going to declare 
a minor in dance. I love the 
dance program!" 

But not all dancers are arts 
majors. Danuta Muchilinski, a 
Fifth College ~, is as 
yet Wldeclarcd in her major 
but plans to go to medical 
school. "The only thing keeping 
me from declaring a minor is 

going down there and doing the 
paperwork. I'm positive I'm going 
to do it," she says. 

Muchilinski finds that taking 
ballet as weU as her medical 
school prerequisites, her general 
education requimnents and her 
Fifth College region of specializa-
tion courses helps to balance her 
schedule. "lfI wasn't, I'd be a 
stress case. I'm taking chemistry, 
neurology and Ballet p." 

"[Students like Danuta are) 
exactly the kind of student we 
want to service," Marshall says. 
Many students feel that UCSD is 
so science-orienled that there isn't 
much of an outlet for tudy in the 
ans. 

"We had a graduate student in 
physics taking classes," she says. 
"He danced with '3's Company [a 
dance company directed by 
faculty member Jean Isaacs) and 
danced professionally." Marshall 
feels the dance program will help 
fill the creative urge that non-arts 
srudents wouldn't otherwise get to 
express. 

Marshall founded the program 
in 1975 in the PE Department. 
"We just grew and grew. [ tried to 
develop a minor under Phys. Ed. 
and it gOl the attention of the ans 
departments. It had'to get out of 

PEtoofferal~er~c 
program. A lot of work. a lot of 
time, a 101 of negotiation [went 
into proving) that the program 
was an academic pursuit, not just 
a physical pursuit" 

With the minor program 
students leam much I1J(R than 
just movement "You need 
to have an understanding 
of choreography and 
composition and 
dance history. 
1bemajor 
components 
[of the 

minor] are movement study and 
composition and theory." 

Students muse take 12 units 
from a choice of 18 movement 
courses in ballet, jazz. modem and 
dance for musical thealer as well 
as upper and lower division 
requirements in choreograJ,hy, 
perfonnance and design. 

Students in the dance program 
also have opponunities for 
perfonnance. There is a fonnal 
concert each year where selected 
students may ~t their work 
with faculty and guest artists. 'The 
Undergraduare Arts Festival in the 
spring offers students a chance to 
showcase their experimental 
choreography. 

'The UCSD Dance Repertory, 
open to students through audi-
tions, performs lecture demonstra-
tions and offers master classes in 
the community and at other UC 
campuses. Students also have the 
chance to apply for professional 
company internships. 

If the enthusiastic reports of 
faculty and students are to be 
believed, the UCSD dance 
program is certainly accomplish-
ing its purpose, which according 
to Marshall is "to develop an 
aesthetic awareness of dance as an 
art fonn by providing solid 
kinesthetic training as a founda-
tion for creative expression." 

With the transition the study of 
dance from the P.E. Department 
to the Theater Department it is 
now time, as student Matt Stem 
put it. "to get arts going!" 

It's Elegance Exemplified explains, "is that it is entirely self-supporting." 
With a membership of over 

250 undergraduates and graduate 

group welcomes dance organiza-
tions on campus or off-campus to 
apply to be part of the entertain-
ment programs. What is the grace displayed by members 

of the Ballroom Dance Club? 
tudents (including participation 

in club functions, that number can 
rise to 7(0) and an average of 
three dances each quarter, the 
fundraising for the dances is no 
easy task for the club's steering 
committee. Aside from the 
chairperson, there are three 
principal members on 

Von Hacht and other club 
members agree that above all the 
dances function as "social 
activities - a place to meet and 
talk. and dance, definitely dance." BY DEB I DUNN , CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

The BaUroOm Dance Oub offered a provocative and no-expense alternative to 
fraternity panics and horror movie 
nwathons when it sponsored its 
thin! annual Halloween dance this 
past October. Complete with 
costume contest and free dance 
instructions, this year's All 
Hallow's Eve Dance boasted an 
anendance of over 200. 

"For the first dance of the year, 
I was very impressed," acknowl-
edges Juliana von Hacht, chair of 
the Ballroom Dance Oub. 

Aside from the opportunity to 
engage in waltzes, the tango, the 
foxtrot and the cha-ella, the 
Halloween I>.mce presented two 
dance performances. 

The UCSD dance team 
perfonned a hustle, which von 
Hacht confesses "completely took 
my breath away!" Fabio Barsic 
and Christopher Wheeler, fourth 
nationally in an amateur competi-
tion, were al.so part of the planned 
entertairunent. They perfonned 
the rumba, paso doble and samba. 

To encourage dancers of every 
level to participate in the festivi-
ties, beginning dancing lessons 
were provided at the dance, as 

they are at every dance sponsored 
by the Ballroom Dance Club. 

"What is so neat is that so 
much emphasis is put on new 
people trying to feel comfortable, 
thanks to Mike Vander Griend," 
says Ann Thyme, a gr<iduate 
student at UCSD and a member of 
the Ballroom Dance Oub. 

According to Thyme, Vander 
Griend, advisor of the Ballroom 
club, is adamant about the dance 
being a comforting and reassuring 
enviroruncnt for beginners. 
Thyme says, "[The club members] 
are he.re to make it fun and have 
people involved at a low-pressure 
leve!." . . 

Darryl Leon, also a graduate 
student and one of the club's 
original members, looked forward 
to the All HaUow's Eve Dance as 
a time when most novice dan.cers 
are apt to participate. "As the first 
dance of the school year," Leon 
asserts, "it is a chance to meet 
new people and as an experienced 
dancer it allows me to teach new 
people. 

"People want to go to learn 
how to dance," continues Leon, 
"and also [as] an outlet for people 
who want to do something

different other than go to night

thing more refmed." 

"Volleyball, aerobics and now 
ballroom dancing are the toughest 
PE classes to get into," Vander 
Griend says. He believes students 
are interested in ballroom dancing 
for a variety of reasons. "Among 
them is the desire to learn social 
skills once they graduate. For 
example, Weddings, family 
reunions and company dances. 
[The dances I can be a non-
threatening, joyous, fun-filled 
function and fortunately, it's a 
lifetime skill." 

Encouraging interaction 
between the experienced and 

the club committee: 
Jeff Angel, 
Andrew Lin and 
Angela

The commit-
tee organize 
about two 
fundraisers a

all of the club events.

it seriously - at least not until graduatioo 
inched closer. 

"Our graduating class - 1991 - faced 
the worse job market in 30-40 years," he 
comments, adding that most of his friends are 
working at temporary jobs, or are till 
looking. 

Thi was not the case for Eubanks. A 
Communication major, he was offered a job 
with the New York Film Festival. 

But he turned it down for 
TFA. 

" I was so amazed by il.. .. 

other teachers say he's more delightful. 
"A lot of the problem is that kids don'l see 

males. They say it's really nice having male 
(role-models]." This year's corps consists of 
38 percent males, while the national teaching 
force is 18 percent male. 

According to Eubanks, TFA members 
don' t act as advisors; instead, "We try to 
provide an environment of openness, toler-
ance, and change ... how we can change the

sometimes so defeated that they don't see 
hope. For example, Michael, a student whose 
modler is a prostitute, plans to become a 
pimp. 

"We try to show him positive 8ltematives 
- that there's more to life. But we don't tell 
him what to do. I use my own life as an 
example." 

Eubanks admits that there's "a definite 
cultural shock going on" with his new job. 

. "I've had kids tell me the 
most [horrifying] stories-
that they've seen someone 
gunned down, or a parent is [TFAJ is a way to take part 

in sociery and also. it's a 
paying job." Eubanks 
explains that teachers are 
hired at regular first-year 
teacher salaries. 

I've had kids tell me the most [horrifying] stories - that killed. And they're so blase 
about it. We' re learning to 
deal with these [kinds of

And they're so blase about it. We try to show them

helping ease this process. 
members, he began the year 
substituting and " team-
teaching," but was soon 
placed as a kindergarten 
teacher. 

According to the Sept. 29 issue of the Sail 
Francisco Examiner, Oakland schools started 
the school year with a full complement of 
teachers for the first time in years. 

" It 's very gratifying," Eubanks says. He 
feel that he has become tougher, and that he 
is making changes everyday. 

"This year alone, a kid, Ryan, started the 
year off with a bad record. He's a big kid -
a fourth-grader. I've been wooong with him 
on handwriting, behavior, self-esteem. The

world," 
He explains that while teachers must follow 

state guidelines, they do have freedom in the 
classroom, and that TFA works for this 
autonomy. 

"We don't just use textbooks," he says, 
adding that people from the community come 
into the classroom, tell stories and sing songs. 
"We let the children speak, and share. The 
kids come alive." 

Eubanks comments that the children are 

...... 
56.04% 

"It is hell going to school 
sometimes because, as a 
first-year teacher, you need 
emotional support ... 
someone to share ideas with, 

a shoulder to cry on. A lot who go through 
[regular] credential programs don't get this," 
Eubanks adds that the drop-out rate among 
TF A instructors is lower than the national 
average. 

Sixth-graders have proven to be the 
toughest challenge to Eubanks. who describes 
them as "so mouthy and street-smart" 

He admits that even his kindergartners are 
not immune'to the streets. Some of them 
include "crack babies" - babies given drugs 

"Some days I [wonder] if I can control 
them - just keep them in t~ir seats .... I try 
to reward the ones who are doing well by 
letting them play around with a microscope or 
read a magazine," Callahan says. At UCSD, 
Callahan majored in animal physiology; now, 
she teaches biology, phys.ical science and 
environmental science. 

Although this year has been relatively 
"quiet," Callahan says that in the past, she had 
a student sabotage the water supply and 
another who would stand on top of the lab 
tables and throw things. Other students have 
threatened her, directly asking what kind of 
car she drives and saying that there would be 
a bomb in it. 

"I've never had something totally out of 
control - [the students] know I'm not afraid 
of them," she says. "I was more puzzled by 
them than afraid." She admits that the first 
few months were "pretty horrible," but that 
"now there aren't as many problems because I 
know how to spot them." 

While some corps members are placed in 
magnet schools with honor students, those 
who work with average or below-average kids 
say that many students disprove their "at-risk" 
stereotype . 

"The problem is not so much intelligence 
as maturity - some are very bright kids; 
some corne to school to be social. I have the 
whole spectrum," Callahan says. 

'These kids are smart - so smart," 
Eubanks says. For example, Brian, a third-
grader, won a poetry contest, which' gave him 
$100 and the chance to meet the mayor of San 
Francisco. 

Since TFA feels that part of the education 
problem is institutionalized racism, the 

"They are paired with a teacher so they 
would have someone to go to on-site for 
emotional and mental support . .. [someone] to 
ask questions of and bounce ideas off." 
Thelmo explains, She adds that, this way, 
"members are always kept abreast." 

According to Eubanks, TF A does not 
actively pursue education majors, but rather 
qualities in people, uch as strength, commit-
ment, flexibility and intelligence. Thelmo 
adds that, in order to fulfill district needs, 
TFA targets bilingual speakers, persons of 

-color and people to teach math, science and 
foreign language. 

Critics ofTFA claim that corps members' 
theoretical knowledge does not compensate 
for their lack of practical experience in the 
classroom. 

"TFA does not claim to make expen 
teachers in eight weeks," Thelmo says. She 
explains, however, that the support system is 
conducive to producing stronger teachers 

throughout the year. 
"Most people we recruit have always 

really been committed, talented in general, in 
points of leadership." She adds, "They've 
been leaders on campus as well as in the 
community. We hope to attract high-quality 
individuals ... because these children deserve 
it. There are amazing teachers out there 
already. We need more of them." 

Only eight of the 20 corps members in 
Callahan's area have cho en to stay for a 
second year. She said that at first, her group 
had no housing, money or support, and were 
"kind of dumped here." 

In any case, Callahan has decided to 
pursue a career in teaching. TFA has already 
provided all corps members with an emer-
gency credential, but they still must apply to 

a credential program. 
According to Eubanks, who is also 

continuing to teach, "a lot of univeniities are 
making it easier to get credentials. catering 
[this process] just for u ." 

TFA's program summary states that one 
of its long-term goals is to elevate the image 
of teaching. Not all TFA members, how-
ever, are expected to stay in the teaching 
profession, as many of the nation 's brightest 
graduates plan to go on to such fields as 
medicine or law. 

"But there are still 1,200 more teacheni 
in the classroom," Eubanks says. "Say 800 
go on to law - that still means 400 more 
are in the classroom. Ninety-eight percent 
are going to be very radical education 
proponents. "

COLLEGE STUDENT 
TURNS FOUR 

OF BLUE 'BOOKS 
INTO GOLD! 

A college student with a double major in physics 
and alchemy shocked the academic community 
by announcing that four years of blue books and 
all the memories that go with them could be 
turned into gold. 

") don't know what people were doing trying 
to tum lead into gold, but obviously they didn't 
know about ArtCarved. I took one look at thcir 

big selection of men's and women's gold rings 
and picked one. It was easy. ArtCarved also gave 
me lots of custOI11 options to remember my four 
year~ ~md a liretime guarantee. I don't know any 
phYSICist who can do that." said the ebullient senior. 

The big-hearted senior plans to share this 
remarkable discovery at the next meeting of the 
Future Physicists of Amcrica.
