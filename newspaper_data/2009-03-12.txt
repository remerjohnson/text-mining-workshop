University of California students 
will most likely see their tuition rise 
by this year’s summer session as the 
UC Board of Regents attempts to close 
a budget gap of nearly $450 million.

Taking their lead from the state 
budget signed by Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger last month — which 
assumes a 9.3 percent increase in stu-
dent fees — campuses are planning to 
raise tuition for the upcoming sum-
mer session by the recommended 9.3 

percent.
“The summer session is coming 

up very quickly … but the fees won’t 
be official until the regents make a 
decision,” UC spokesman Ricardo 
Vazquez said.

University officials have indicated 
that fee hikes will continue into Fall 
Quarter, though no official decision 
will be made until after the regents 
meet in May. If the 9.3 percent fee 
hike is extended to the 2009-10 aca-
demic year, undergraduate tuition will 
increase from $7,126 a year to approx-
imately $7,789.

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Lisa Chen lobbied in 
Sacramento early this month for 
the College Affordability Act, which 
would put a five-year freeze on tuition 
and gather revenue for UC and CSU 
campuses by placing a 1 percent tax 
on California residents who make 

over $1 million per year. She said fur-
ther tuition increases would deter low- 
and middle-income students from 
applying to the university, potentially 
limiting campus diversity.

“It reflects very poor planning 
on [the university’s] part if they are 
announcing fee increases only a few 
months before the summer session

The American Federation of 
Teachers, on behalf of University 
of California librarians, has reached 
an impasse with the university 
after a two-year struggle for salary 
increases that the univerity claims 
it cannot afford. 

Confidential discussions with a 
state-appointed mediator — pro-
vided by the State Mediation and 
Conciliation Service — are slated 
for March 24, an attempt to end a 
drawn-out negotiation process that 

began in 2007.
UC librarians, who demand that 

their salaries be raised to an ammo-
unt slightly less than those offered 
at California State University cam-
puses, claim the university has 
failed to take the negotiations seri-
ously. 

“If they would start bargain-
ing, we might lower our original 
requests,” chief mediator for UC 
librarians Mike Rotkin said. “We are 
not locked into a position. We want 
to see both sides moving toward 
each other, and that’s what was not 
happening. We want them to move 

before we continue to move.”
According to Rotkin, UC librar-

ian salaries currently lag behind 
those of CSU librarians by roughly 
$10,000 to $15,000 annually. 

Union representatives claim 
that this disparity has lowered the 
quality of the university’s librar-
ies, because qualified librarians are 
harder to recruit and retain when 
offered better salaries elsewhere.

In January, the university offered 
the union a 1 percent increase in 
professional development funds,

Campaigning for the Associated 
Students general election kicked off 
last week — and after running practi-
cally unopposed last spring, it looks 
like Student Voice! candidates are 

finally face a little healthy competi-
tion.

The Clean Slate has emerged 
this year as a major competitor, with 
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Adam Teitelbaum set to go head-to-
head with Student Voice! candidate 
and current Associate Vice President 
of Local Affairs Erin Brodwin for the 
council presidency.

Independents vying for the 
presidential spot include Thurgood 
Marshall College juniors Andrew 
Garofalo and Giang Pham and cur-
rent Associate Vice President of 

Student Organizations Utsav Gupta.
“The Clean Slate is all about a 

fresh start, and a fresh face to A.S.,” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
and candidate for Vice President of 
Student Life Stephanie Usry said. “We 
think that A.S. has lost its focus and 
who it’s supposed to serve. We want 
to support student ventures, and we 
want to make A.S. much more acces-
sible.”

Usry, who was an A.S. senator for 
two years, said she has avoided join-

ing the Student Voice! slate through-
out her career in student government.

“I never ran with Student Voice! 
[because] I didn’t feel that they want-
ed me as an individual; they just want-
ed me to be on their 
slate,” Usry said. 
“Adam [Teitelbaum] 
and I were talking 
and we decided to 
form a slate, and then 
we talked to some of 
our friends who have 
been involved in the 
[student commu-
nity].”

Usry dismissed 
claims that the Clean 
Slate is a “frat slate” 
or a “party slate,” as 
many students have 
labeled it. She said 
the party is diversity-minded, and 
that all eight candidates have various 
backgrounds in student involvement 
on campus.

Current Revelle College Senator 
Katie Hall said she is running for 
all-campus senator under Student 

Voice! because the slate values student 
empowerment, access and affordabil-
ity and campus community. 

“I really want to create a sense of 
pride all year long, not just on Spirit 
Night,” Hall said. “I also really want 

to work on redo-
ing our funding 
policies, because 
A.S. really needs to 
restructure how we 
fund student orgs 
with the [fees] we 
have students pay.”

T h u r g o o d 
Marshall junior 
Sam Huang, who 
is running inde-
pendently for 
Vice President 
of Finances and 
Resources, said her 
campaign is direct-

ed toward making the council more 
accessible to the general student body. 

Huang said she is focusing her 
campaign on issues that directly affect 
students, such as the recent cancer 
cluster controversy surrounding the 
Literature Building. 

“I’ve been really frustrated with 
the way the university and A.S. have 
been running,” Huang said. “It’s like 
students are commodities of the 
corporate university, especially now 
with the budget cuts. The Literature 
Building situation, for example, is an 
example of the state and administra-
tive indifference for the university’s 
staff and students.”

Students will vote by ranking can-
didates in order of preference, a meth-
od that wasn’t used that year since 
most candidates ran unopposed. The 
top-ranked candidate in each position 
will be elected to the council. 

At least 20 percent of the student 
body must vote for the election results 
to be valid.

“We are anticipating a pretty heavy 
race this year,” General Elections 
Manager and Associate Vice President 
of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll 
said. “I think it’s perfectly reasonable 
to see a 20 percent turnout margin, 
which is pretty good considering this 
university — apathy and everything.”

Voting will take place throughout 
second week of Spring Quarter.

begins,” Chen said. “These hikes 
would essentially be a tax on students, 
and the [increased] sticker price will 
make lower-income students think 
they can’t afford a UC education. 
The UC has not exhausted all other 
options.”

Lt. Gov. and UC Regent John 
Garamendi also expressed concern 
over the possible fee hikes. 

“This proposed fee increase is noth-
ing more than a $662 a year tax increase 
on every student at the University of 
California,” Garamendi said in a state-
ment released yesterday. “On Friday, 
thousands of future UC students will 
start receiving their acceptance letters 
to UC colleges. Unfortunately, as a 
result of the recently enacted budget, 
2,300 qualified high school seniors will 
not enter California’s universities, and 
those who do will face even higher 
tuition. We have failed to invest in 
California’s future.”

To deal with declining state sup-
port, individual campuses have also 

announced plans to cut internal 
spending. 

UC Berkeley announced Tuesday 
that it will reduce its budget by 8 per-

cent by laying off an undetermined 
number of employees, significantly 
decreasing the hiring of new faculty 
and increasing student tuition and 
student service fees.

In a report on budget-reduction 
strategies released yesterday, UCSD 
officials revealed their long-term 
approach to reducing operating costs. 
A projected $24.5 million will be saved 
in 2009-10 by lowering costs through 
the following measures: curtailment of 
nonessential travel, entertainment and 
meeting costs; deferment of equip-
ment purchases; and a reduction of 
energy consumption. 

A projected $9.5 million will be 
saved by implementing a soft hir-
ing freeze, encouraging employees to 
enter the voluntary employee-buyout 
program, redistributing the workload 
of vacant positions, reducing staff pro-
visions and indefinitely postponing 48 
ladder-rank faculty positions.

The campus also plans to save an 
additional $2.5 million by reducing 
energy costs, and $500,000 by sus-
pending academic-enrichment pro-
grams.

money used to support the costs 
of informational conferences and 
research, but no increase in librar-
ian salaries. 

UC officials have repeatedly 
claimed that the university lacks 
the funds to support the increased 
salaries, primarily due to a lack of 
state funding. 

“We’re going through a fiscal 
problem with all kinds of cuts from 
the state of California right now, 
but we’re trying to find a solution,” 
said UC Director of Collective 
Bargaining Howard Pritas. “We’re 
going to work with the union as 
best we can.”

Rotkin said the university should 

withdraw the funds for the request-
ed salary raises from its reserves, 
because it has roughly $6.5 billion 
in unrestricted funds that could be 

used to finance the increases. 
“The money [to fund the 

increases] is not coming from the 

state during this economic crisis,” 
Rotkin said.

After rejecting the university’s 
initial 1 percent development funds 
offer, UC-AFT has continued to 
bargain for a more substantial 
increase. 

Rotkin said librarians should be 
entitled to the same quality of nego-
tiations as those offered to other 
unions, citing recent pay increases  
secured by UC police and hospital 
workers.

“All we’re asking for is what some 
other unions have gotten,” Rotkin 
said. “This isn’t unprecedented.”

Clocking in at slightly less than three hours, last night’s meet-ing was brief for a council that 
has watched many a day change at the 
spacious Price Center East Forum. 

Motivated by 10th-week assign-
ments and a sparse agenda, council-
members dedicated the bulk of their 
evening to discussion of the Resolution 
in Support of Eliminating Bottled 
Water at UCSD, which was eventually 
passed. Fran Avendano of the Social 
and Environmental Sustainability 
Committee got the ball rolling 
with a rousing 
PowerPoint pre-
sentation outlining 
the necessity and 
feasibility of plas-
tic-bottle elimina-
tion — complete 
with compostable-
cup clipart and three ideas to ensure co-
eds stay hydrated through Sun God’s 
headliner. 

After a few questions for Avendano, 
councilmembers put the water chat on 
ice for two special presentations. The 
first came from Director of Special 
Events and Protocol Judy Lane, who 
sought bright ideas from the council for 
UCSD’s upcoming 50th anniversary. 
The yearlong celebration — tentatively 
themed “Genius is in the Doing” — will 
include annual Triton events like Sun 
God, and incorporate new anniversary-
based ones like Founder’s Day or a 
community service day.

Arundathi Gururajan, A.S. rep-
resentative to the Registration Fee 
Committee, was responsible for the 
second presentation: an update on how 
the reg fee budget is faring through sys-
temwide cuts (not well), an indistinct 
rundown of the fee-funded “clusters” 
and a request that councilmembers 
rank the clusters in order of student 
preference. 

Confused as to why the committee 

would be feeling budget strain given 
that its revenue is constant (it’s from 
students, not Sacramento, so while our 
state may be scraping bucket bottom, 
attendance has steadily increased to 
its current plateau), councilmembers 
had lots of questions for Gururajan. 
Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to 
answer many of them because of the 
committee’s top-secret nature. 

Undeterred by their evasive guest, 
councilmembers continued their 
inquiries until All-Campus Senator 
Meghan Clair, so disgruntled she was 

about ready to rip 
off her Ugg boot 
and throw it across 
the council floor, 
brought a swift 
end to fruitless 
questioning.

And after a few 
reports it was water time once again. 
Supporters — led by resolution spon-
sor and All-Campus Senator Chris 
Westling — encouraged the council 
to outlaw plastic bottles, as it has previ-
ously done with Styrofoam and plastic 
bags, arguing that plastic bottles are an 
unnecessary feature of modern mar-
keting. 

However, some on the council 
were unsure of the measure’s practical-
ity. Wary of SESC-proposed water jug 
cleanliness and upset that the com-
mittee hadn’t contacted many of those 
affected by a possible plastic-bottle ban, 
Clair called the resolution a “gross exer-
cise of power, limiting students’ rights 
to make informed decisions as con-
sumers.” And Associate Vice President 
of Advocacy Frank Carroll implored 
the council to research the implications 
of such a ban before approving it.

But as Associate Vice President 
of Athletic Relations Peter Benesch 
pointed out: resolutions aren’t policy, 
they’re suggestions. And ultimately the 
measure passed.

The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.

For months, they warned it could happen. Now, barely a week after hundreds of UC students 
visited Sacramento to gain legislative 
support for a statewide tuition freeze, 
the university is considering student 
fee hikes. So much for affordability.

Though the UC Board of Regents 
hasn’t made any official decisions, the 
leading indicators are all there: a new 

state budget approved last month slash-
es university funding by 10 percent, 
campuses systemwide are announcing 
sweeping internal cuts and the regents 
decided last month to cap a number 
of high-executive salaries. You know 
things are bad when the university’s 
top talent begins to feel the crunch. 

It’s easy to blame these proposed 
tuition hikes on the financial catastro-

phe, but students must avoid slipping 
into this realm of apathetic acceptance. 
We must confront the source of this 
added financial burden — a state gov-
ernment that continues to undervalue 
higher education’s importance — and 
demand change from above.

As evidenced by the recent student-
lobbying excursion to the state capital, 
many have already moved to action. 

But more across the UC system must 
make known their opposition to these 
tuition hikes and seek reform on a 
legislative level. It is only when our 
lawmakers come to realize the extent 
of our opposition that they will pro-
vide more support to the university, 
support needed to prevent any further 
financial strain on already overbur-
dened students.

With A.S. election season already underway, it’s excellent to see candi-
dates excited and races contested for a 
change. Last spring’s listless campaigns 
gave way to an equally passive council, 
and this board hopes candidates will 
carry their energy beyond the April 
10 result announcements, and onto 
the council floor next year. Though 
the 2008-09 council does deserve a 
hearty golf clap for nearly meeting sta-
tus quo, the future student government 
will inherit a herd of long-ignored 
elephants, which if left unaddressed 
any further threaten to evict council-
members from their chambers.

Candidates are historically skilled 
at pounding the Library Walk pave-
ment during election season, merrily 
meeting with any student who will 
listen. But once positions are secured 
and nametags are crisply laminat-
ed, councilmembers can’t set their 
Facebooks back to private quickly 
enough. The new council must kick 
this secrecy to the curb and try on 
a little transparency (if only because 
it’ll look better than those bulk-
ordered T-shirts). Councilmembers 
are experts at promoting transparency 
when they want something — like 
$19.82 more per quarter, for instance 
— but it’s their job to communicate 
with students all throughout the year, 
both to keep us informed and to col-
lect feedback and suggestions. 

And speaking of the recent activi-
ty-fee raise, next year’s council will be 
responsible for all those sweet nothings 
we were whispered in exchange for a 
pledge of our love and fiscal support. 
Nearly 60 percent of the fee increase is 
going toward programming, student 

organizations, services and operations 
of the Associated Students, and with 
this money the future council must 
make some big adjustments to cur-
rent party-planning practices. Events 
must be accessible — the days of ticket 
shortages and turned-away students 
need to end immediately. This isn’t 
to say the Sun God Festival is every-
thing. Traditionally popular events 
like Bear Gardens have been scarce 
this year and with so much of the fee 
increase flowing directly into the A.S. 
Programming goblet, students expect 
to see the office expand its campus 
community-building projects.

UCSD’s alcohol- and speech-policy 
revisions will have a huge impact on 
student life, and undergrads rely on 
councilmembers to protect our inter-
ests. The council must select its most 
diligent student representatives to 

serve as informed and active commit-
tee members. Those representatives 
should foster communication with 
the student body to keep undergrads 
informed about the policies that will 
impact us most.

Perhaps this council’s most egre-
gious oversight is its monetary negli-
gence. The incoming Vice President of 
Finance and Resources will have their 
work cut out for them — with a myriad 
of deteriorating enterprises, none of 
which bring the council appreciable 
revenue. Students are tired of seeing 
their money thrown away over a coffee 
shop, and if current councilmembers 
can’t pull together a viable solution for 
the Grove Caffe, that will be the incom-
ing group’s first order of business.

But most importantly, representa-
tives must keep in mind how and why 
they were elected — and keep in touch 

with the students who put them in 
office. While it may serve candidates 
to consider these issues during their 
campaign discourse, students won’t be 
served until that talk turns to walk.

By David Harvey
Senior Staff Writer 

STATE NEWS — The proposition that 
just won’t die — good ol’ number eight 
— has found its way into the limelight 
of the California Supreme Court. But 
the debate over the amendment’s con-
stitutionality and its limits on individu-
al rights has created a conundrum with 
one clear solution: We need to over-
haul California’s proposition process. 

On March 5, the California 
Supreme Court heard oral arguments 
for and against Proposition 8 — which 
defines marriage as a union between 
a man and a woman — while student 
protestors joined thousands lobbying 
outside the courthouse for the propo-
sition’s repeal. Though the court has 
90 days to make a ruling, it’s likely the 
constitutional amendment will remain 
intact, alongside hundreds of previous 
changes to the California Constitution.

California voters change the 
Constitution far too easily, allowing 
laws to dodge the Legislature and to 
be uncommonly protected from the 
court’s judgment through precedence. 
However, with a few changes, we can 
protect ourselves from both frivolous 
legalities and blatant legal abuses.

The Golden State has approved 
more than 500 constitutional revisions 
in its history, compared to 27 nation-
ally. Articles in the state constitution 
include provisions allowing citizens 
to fish on government property and 
judges to work second jobs as educa-
tors. The latest amendment — more 
suited for an out-of-date dictionary — 
scoffs at equality.

California is one of 17 states with 
an initiative process that allows citi-
zens to draft either statutes, which 
are standard laws, or constitutional 
amendments. Constitutional revi-
sion is reserved for proposal by the 
California Legislature. 

It is ridiculously easy to amend 
the state constitution. The only differ-
ence between proposing a statute and 
a constitutional amendment is a few 
signatures. A statute must be backed by 
5 percent of the voter pool and only 8 
percent of eligible voters must petition 
a constitutional amendment. 

Approving an amendment pro-
posed by any individual or interest 
group requires a simple majority: 50 
percent plus one vote. The amendment 
is effective immediately without going 
to the Assembly or Senate. If legisla-
tors, on the other hand, wish to pro-

pose an amendment or revision, two-
thirds of each chamber must approve 
the proposition before it reaches the 
ballot. We allow voters to bypass the 
people they have trusted to govern. 
Essentially, legislators’ positions are 
nullified through an illogical institu-
tion that allows voters to thrust any law 
that might not necessarily pass a leg-
islative review upon the constitution. 

Change to the U.S. Constitution 
requires a three-quarter approval from 
both houses. The process is deliber-
ately difficult to prevent inconsisten-
cies and legal abuses that infringe upon 
equality. That process creates stability, 
and California should adopt similarly 
strenuous guidelines. The state needs 
to adopt the three-quarter rule and 
apply it to changes proposed by the 
voters as well.

Additionally, the state should 
implement a process for court review 
of proposed amendments. Proposition 
8 bypassed a May 2008 Supreme Court 
ruling overturning Proposition 22, 
which passed in 2000 and similarly 
defined marriage as strictly between 
a man and woman. In its ruling the 
court said, “Retaining the designation 
of marriage exclusively for opposite-
sex couples ... may well have the effect 

of perpetuating a more general prem-
ise — now emphatically rejected by 
this state — that gay individuals and 
same-sex couples are in some respects 
‘second-class citizens.’”

Contrary to their first ruling, jus-
tices seem reluctant to overturn the 
voters’ most recent marriage-defining 
decision. Whereas Proposition 22 
was approved by 62 percent of voters, 
Proposition 8 only passed with a 52 
percent majority. The court is cooing 
precedence and is reluctant to nullify a 
constitutional amendment, essentially 
defending the Californian citizen’s 
authority to redraft the constitution. 

The California Supreme Court is 
comfortable overturning a statute con-
tradictory to the constitution — such 
as the original defense of marriage, 
Proposition 22 — but reluctant to 
rescind a similar passage in the con-
stitution. The voters have successfully 
slid past constitutionally protected 
equal rights by rewriting the constitu-
tion in favor of a slim majority. This 
kind of action cannot stand.

The best argument against adher-
ing to the court’s hands-off approach 
came from Kenneth Starr, the lawyer

UCSD’s depressing social scene needs no further belabor-ing. Unfortunately, there isn’t 
much my little ol’ column can do to 
make you leave Geisel, but, through 
my efforts to establish a healthy social 
life in my first year at UCSD, I’ve 
prepared some helpful strategies to 
make the most of our party-deprived 
weekends. 

Because of UCSD’s large size, 
its social scene is inevitably divided 
into smaller subgroups. Whether it 
be through an athletic team, a Greek 
gathering or  your awkward dorm 
socials, it’s easier to collect guaranteed 
weekend party-mates in structured 
social cliques. But, as freshmen shop 
around to find their most comfortable 
party pit stop, they’ll inevitably experi-
ence all of these options before they 
settle down and find their niche. It is 
understandably awkward, however, to 
be a freshman surrounded by seasoned 
sorority girls, binge-drinking boys and 
unwelcoming glares. Feelings of dis-
comfort are common enough to be 
considered a freshman initiation, but 
it’s time you face the facts and priori-
tize. What is college if you can’t spend 
your Friday nights numbing stress by 
getting rip-roaring drunk? Besides, 
party sampling might be the only way 
you can break out of your Friday night 
“Office” marathon ritual. 

If you don’t want to buy the car 
without a couple test drives first, here 
are a few helpful hints that might lead 
you to some inner circles, or at least 
some free alcohol. 

To earn some clout within the 
Greek system, target the same few fra-
ternities and make friends with a few 
members. Freshman pledges are ideal, 
as it’s their job to promote the chapter 
and bring people to ragers. You’ll 
need to become friends with these 
token brothers in the beginning of the 
year and make an effort to tune into 
the things they like (and flattering 
text messages complimenting their 
classic frat-boy muscle shirts won’t 
hurt). Little acts like these will guar-
antee a quick reply with all the week-
end party deets. Once you’ve received 
the address and confirmation that 
there will be unlimited jungle juice 
at your beck and call, it’s time to plan 
your first impression. To guarantee 
entry, make sure you or someone 
you go with is a scantily-clad woman. 
Although this could lead to potential 
harassment, making connections with 
a group of younger fraternity broth-
ers just might be your ticket to those 
weekends to remember — or, better 
yet, not remember. 

It’s no shocker that athletes train, 
eat and party together, and it’s excit-
ing when they open these parties to 
the public after home games because 
you can feel the excitement in the 
air. But beware; while these parties 
will most likely be filled with wash-
board-abbed athletes, it’s difficult to 
break the sports-clique seal. Keeping 
up with sports jargon is no easy feat, 
especially in a room of lanky, tower-
ing basketball players who smash beer 
cans onto their foreheads and subse-

quently shoot them into trash cans. 
To fit in, I recommend you adopt a 
sporty attitude before getting to the 
party. Also, don’t attend unless the 
home team just won — chatting with 
pissed-off athletes who just lost a big 
game is depressing. Spend a few min-
utes memorizing some statistics and 
brush up on your athletic lingo before 
wandering into the party so you can 
strike up a conversation. For bonus 
points, challenging basketball players 
to a game of beer pong will not only 
show them you can bank a shot, it will 
also get you drunk for free. 

As for dorm parties, you must 
show up with a bottle of alcohol in 
hand. Choose a specific area (Sixth 
College apartments tend to be the best 
thanks to their secluded location), 
and follow the hip-hop to the near-
est party. It might be intimidating to 
knock on a random door, but when it 
comes to underage drinking, anyone 
who shows up bearing gifts is a wel-
come addition. Plus, your handle of 

Popov will do wonders for your initial 
hesitance, making that apartment feel 
just like home.

If you find yourself desperate for 
action, hit up International House. 
Most residents are European students 
whose main goal is to live it up in 
sunny San Diego, so you’ll be hard 
pressed to find a dry room on the 
block. Those Euros know how to dance 
and will probably be less stingy than 
any American when it comes to booze. 

It isn’t easy to come to a campus 
as big as ours and dive right in to a 
group of people who have already 
established their social circles. My tips 
are surely not foolproof, but entertain-
ing weekends will surely come to those 
who make an effort. It’s up to you to 
change UCSD’s socially dead reputa-
tion, and when all else fails, find your 
favorite party partner, wade through 
the sweaty crowd to the alcohol table, 
tap into the keg of cheap beer and 
get wasted. Parties seem much more 
entertaining when you’re too foggy to 
notice how awkward you might look.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro 

defending Proposition 8, who said “the 
people are sovereign, even if unwise, 
and they can tug at equality.” 

Even the proposition’s legal coun-
sel is aware of the system’s danger-
ous discrepancy, but rather than call 
for change, Starr is congratulating 
the loophole. He’s flaunting it. And 
it’s unlikely that any protections 
will be created without overhauling 
California’s amendment process.

The California Supreme Court has 
taken action in the past. In 1963, jus-
tices famously overturned Proposition 
14, which would have allowed prop-
erty owners, through the amendment’s 
vague language, to discriminate when 
renting or selling property.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court’s 
reversal of a voter-approved amend-
ment is rare and the precedence for 
a hands-off approach is clear. This 
needn’t be the case. The court should 
have a more active role in ensuring that 
freedoms and rights are upheld, and 
should keep mob rule in check.

California’s initiative process has 
been used to propose alcohol prohibi-
tion in 1914, provide preferences for 
veterans in 1934 and establish English 
as the official state language in 1986. 

Out of the 13 amendment proposi-
tions on the 2008 ballot, three passed 
in November: Proposition 9, a con-
voluted amendment purporting vic-
tim’s rights over those of the accused; 
Proposition 11, which structured com-

mittee guidelines for political redis-
tricting; and Proposition 8. Changes 
must be made so these matters, strictly 
(or not so strictly) legal and not consti-
tutional, are properly addressed.

First lawmakers must commis-
sion a constitutional review. Although 
several have been implemented in 
the past, this time we need a purge. 
Unnecessary passages must be relegat-
ed to standard law, and contradictory 
passages should be scrapped. 

For instance, “only marriage 
between a man and a woman is valid 
or recognized in California,” follows, 
“a citizen or class of citizens may not 
be granted privileges or immunities 
not granted on the same terms to all 
citizens.” Seriously, this is absurd and 

hardly justifies pointing out the obvious 
conflict. The laws dictating changes to 
the U.S. Constitution should be applied 
to both the California Legislature and 
the electorate, and a rotational system 
of judicial review should be enacted 
to prevent the unwise from “tugging 
at equality.”

As amendment and revision over-
kill bogs down the constitution, the 
lines between laws and constitutional 
rights blur. The constitution’s place is 
not to outline regulations over redis-
tricting or to promote the state’s official 
language. It certainly isn’t the place 
to define marriage or give veterans a 
vague preference. 

Checks and balances are at the 
foundation of our representational 

democracy system, but the California 
constitutional amendment process 
contains few checks and even fewer 
balances. California is more akin to 
a direct democracy in regard to the 
initiative process, going against the 
principles of our state and nation. 

Our democracy, contrary to popu-
lar argument, is not the great institu-
tion it is because of the majority’s 
right to create law, but because of its 
unequivocal protection of equality and 
individual freedom. With a stricter 
process for constitutional amendment 
and reform, these freedoms will be 
ensured.

SoCal’s certainly got a knack for 
turning out middle-aged male artists 
with a penchant for painting the female 
form. Caricatured vixens and pixies that

ormed in 2005 from a grab bag of 
uncharacteristically bright-eyed, 
seemingly mismatched musicians, Get

ed attention at the 2007 San Diego Music 
Awards. Now that they’re back in native 
SoCal sands — splitting before the inter-
national half of the Jack’s Mannequin tour 
— the bluesy quintet is making a grassroots 
return at UCSD’s own lowlit Loft. 

These lulling soulsters, with dissentingly 
sunless complexions, stick to their time-
honored technique: vocal harmonies atop an 
underwhelming Broadway brand of pedes-
trian ivory tinkles — a little too soft rock for 
the KSDT crowd.

While you might mistake them for post-
goth Cure wannabes making an off-base 
stab at the top 40, Loretta’s finals-week 
performance — before heading eastward to 
SXSW — is bound to at least be stress-free. 
Thick cabaret vocals, warbled off by Steven 
Bradford and lacquered with a cello’s vibrato, 
make for a robust, bass-y performance — 
especially on mellow cuts like “Ketamine”

But over the phone on Monday, Emily

then you’re not judged by your age,” Wells 
says, laughing when asked what being a prod-

Not for this folksy quintet. They rejected 
that brand a long time ago, ditching the 
SoCal surf stereotype for true-blue rock ‘n’ 
roll. And the semi-depressive, jalopy jaunt 
of Americana suits them — mostly. Don’t 
mind the emo tinge to Matthew Vasquez’s 
vocals, or the ever-present black/neon plastic 
shades: No, they’ve traded in Beach Boys for 
Bob Dylan, sandy beers for apple pie. (Even 
if it seems like just another marketing tool, 
the band’s truly trying to plow “into the great 
music that has come out of America in the 
last 200 years.” Honest to God.)

Besides, the road dirt under their fin-
gernails underscores the heartland tale — a 
band breaking to make it, paying their dues  
to backwoods Southern twang and retracing

GET YOUR 
FLOWERY ASS 
OFF THE WALL 
AND WORK IT

S o you wake up mid-downward dog, humid and mildly horny from what could have either been 
the best sleep of your life or phase 
three of the ultimate dance party, 
and notice you’ve been born into a 
bologna sandwich whose breadstuffs 
are none other than a whole-wheatey 
M.I.A. and one of the Ying-Yang 
twins — the midgety one with the 
old-man-willow beard, knowing 
your luck. But everything looks cool 
under a strobe light, so hide behind 

your hair and do some weird shit 
with your hands until you begin to 
remember who you are and what 
your momma gave you to work with.

Phase four: Queue up some curve 
balls. You’re looking to draw out the 
phase-three climax as long as pos-
sible without letting anyone realize 
they’re losing steam. We’re talking 
’90s alt-rock radio, “Say My Name,” 
White Snake, super sounds of the 
’70s nobody had any idea they knew 
so well. This is a dangerous middle 
ground you’re teetering on, so try to 
identify the most universal of your 
nostalgia trips — because as much as 
you wish it to be true, not everyone 
listened to Elvis Costello in their 
awkward stage, and might need more 
of a standard karaoke lineup to keep 
their personal pants-party alive. Start 
with radio oldies — “You Don’t Own 
Me,” the Shangri-Las, motherfuck-
ing Motown — and never underes-
timate the wall of sound —“Be My 
Baby,” above all others — because 
even Leonard Cohen can be danced 
to when Phil Spector is involved (see 
Death of a Ladies’ Man).

You see, the key to making every-
one like your crappy music is get-
ting down to it — hard. You can 
sink as low as pre-SexyBack Justin 
Timberlake and maintain the groove, 
as long as you get on the pool table or

"The greatest musical 
of all time...”

— Newsweek

Threepenny_UCSDGuardian.indd   1 3/5/2009   12:15:24 PM

SoCal Comfort, Juicy Covers and Coast Pop Warm Up at Loft
the steps of forefathers and mothers. 
It’s researched art, Kerouac-style. 
In the 2007 debut Ode to Sunshine, 
they’ve got a little piece of every-
thing: Johnny Cash’s Arkansas soul, 
Bruce Springsteen’s Jersey highs, 
Janis Joplin’s Texan lows. The band’s 
got a knack for folding it all up 
together — heart-tugging stories of 
small towns and big cities sink into 
God-fearing anthems and social cri-
tiques. Rock and country walk hand 
in hand; faces and names blend deep 
into dusty, soulful tracks.

“Children shut your eyes/We’ll 
tell you what to see/ This world 
is burnin’ down/ And you’re the 
ones to lead,” Vasquez croons. 
Accompanied by a summer-sweet 
harmonica, prairie-swept and a 
soaring Coldplay climax, “Children” 
takes a refreshingly present look at 
frightening financial times. 

“Parade” tackles the same ultra-
depressing topic, cursing all you 
assholes “bragging about your gold/ 
Wage you made when no one made 
their own.” Sean Walker’s plunky, 
cynical guitar makes it a mean road-
trip song, and Vasquez’s tortured, 
whiskey-fused screams layer in 
the chains — so that we’re caught 
between going and gone, down to 
that dirty Southern core.

Delta Spirit is so close, scratch-
ing at a tradition just out of reach. 
Maybe with a few more beefy records, 
another asphalt-ripping tour and a 
complete image overhaul (sayonara, 
skinny jeans), they just might pull it 
off. “I’m a wandering soul,” Vasquez 
sighs. So get to wandering, already.

▶ SPIRIT, !"#$%&'()%*
it? That’s what matters.” 

Wells’ first single off 2008’s The 
Symphonies: Dreams Memories & Parties 
underscores her refusal to enter the 
self-indulgent, spacey genre of “experi-
mental” music, which often sacrifices 
rhythm for mood, melody for abstrac-
tion. Instead, “Symphony 6: Fair Thee 
Well & the Requiem Mix” is a spine-
tingling cross of veritable hip-hop and 
vocals more suited to a gothic choir, 
hi-hat beats propping Baroque rounds 
and oak-hollowed strings layered one by 
one until some 30 ghostly echoes flour-
ish beneath Wells’ Bjork-inspired spells: 
“Coming down the mountain in a wet 
carriage/ Full speed like a spent mar-
riage/ I got more than enough to keep 
me whole/ For once I’m not slightly out 
of control,” she sighs.

Likewise, her rendition of Biggie’s 
“Juicy” stretches spoken word into 
haunting, singy song, taking the classic 
hood fairytale to higher, synthier levels. 

“I find myself being drawn to the 
raunchiest, nastiest, non-PC stuff,” Wells 
says. “I love how hip-hop production 
is so expansive — you have a genre like 
rock, with formulas that work. But with 
hip-hop, you can grab from any influence 
you want. Sampling is kind of like mak-
ing a collage … You can take something 
really out there and make it accessible.” 

Don’t worry — Wells knows she can’t 
rap. Sometimes, as on “Symphony 3” and 
“5,” she tries a little — but for the most 
part, her orchestral tapestries, glocken-
spiel-maraca decor and windy, sensual 
climbs are closer to Lovage than Luda. 

And as for her dream collab? 
“I’d say the L.A. Philharmonic is high 

on the list — or MF Doom.”

▶ WELLS, !"#$%&'()%*
and “When You Notice.” 

In live action, Bradford bears 
some tonal similarity to Panic! 
At the Disco’s melodramatic 
frontman Brendon Urie, albeit 
without the Las Vegas environ to 
make the vaudevillian jazz and 
theatrics bearable. Instead, San 
Diego’s breezy coastal clime lends 
his lyrics a Care-Bear positivity 
and Christian soft-rock cadences. 

With only two albums to its 
Beatles-inspired pen name (an EP 
in ’05 and debut Over the Wall 
in ’07), most of the band’s soap-
boxing ballads run the gamut of 
multilayered rags to alt-rock jam-
borees. 

“Girlface” is a cloying love note 
of a ballad, saddling a slower tempo 
with less instruments than usual 
and showcasing Loretta’s songwrit-
ing at its third-grade worst. 

“You, you’re my one and only” 
Bradford banally carols. “You, 
whom without I’m lonely / You, 
my girlface love.” 

Much of the band’s style 
comes from a happy-go-lucky 
pop melodica that rubs shoulders 
with Maroon 5 soul (sans Levine’s 
pitchy pith), and though the whole 
scene it makes for a swell small-
town sound, it’s just not grand 
enough for big-city lights. 

The slim amount of Web con-
tent on Get Back Loretta makes 
their SoCal bubble clear,  promis-
ing the local color needed to fill 
up the Loft with enough won-over 
fandom for a more than-decent-
dance party.

Not-so-Nice Neighbors Haunt the 
Human Psyche in Craven Remake

By Amanda Martinek
Staff Writer

T he Last House on the Left,” a remake of Wes Craven’s 1972 horror-suspense thriller of the 
same name, follows an eerie thread 
in human nature and horror films: 
Anyone can become a killer under 
the right circumstances.

Taking off for summer vacation, 
the Collingwood family — father 
John (Tony Goldwyn), mother Emma 
(Monica Potter) and daughter Mari 
(Sara Paxton) — arrive at their iso-
lated lakeside property in the boon-
docks, which just happens to be both 
the “the last house on the left” and the 
only dwelling for miles. 

Soon restless at the lodge, Mari 

borrows the car to visit her quirky 
friend Paige (Martha Maclsaac) — 
the rebellious one — at her gener-
al-store job, where they meet soft-
spoken, droopy-eyed loner Justin 
(Spencer Treat Clark). At the propo-
sition of toking in his motel room, 
the girls don’t hesitate, skittering back 
with their new pal for some illegal 
shenanigans. Mari, as the responsible 
and saintly daughter she is, tries to 
tell her mother about the sleepover 
plans — but the phone mysteriously 
loses connection.

Waiting at the motel, of course, is 
Justin’s family of wanted criminals, 
who soon decide it’s best to dispose 
of the kids for fear of them leaking

incorporate the standing lamp. (That said, when hosting 
the ultimate dance party at a random frat house, I would 
recommend not throwing found-art Froot Loops at each 
other and unsuspecting freakdancers nearby, because 
no one will appreciate your creativity quite as much as 
they should. Especially when you then attempt to water-
pressure them out of your cleavage and creatively clog the 
communal bro drain.) 

Phase five: not so much a phase as an inevitable 
overthrow of your superior judgment by the drunk-ass 
proletariat. Their rebellion can certainly be postponed 
by not subjecting them to your Depeche Mode anthol-
ogy, but there’s always going to be that Lil Wayne fanboy 
who will stop at nothing to show everyone his swag and 
warble out, “She even wear her hurr down her back like 
mine” like he doesn’t have a gravity-defying headful of 
Asian wisps. And I’ve definitely served my time among 
the rebels. You see, however hard you want us to re-live 
your Monster Massive experience, we the YouTube ban-
dits will always be there, fighting the good fight against 
your techno and not giving a fuck if you hate our reggae-
ton — just trust me, your eardrums are thanking us for  
sparing them “Live Your Life” for the fifty millionth time.

Which brings us to lifestyle longevity: The dance party 
should not always be perfect. In fact, it can often be more 
satisfying with restrictions. That’s why, every other night 
on the flo’, you need to either accidentally grab your room-
mate’s shitty-ass iPod or, preferably, sniff out the nearest 
joint with — drumroll please — the corner-workin’, the 
circle-jerkin’, the God-love-it all-American jukebox.

Grumble all you want, but some of the most magi-
cal body rolls can happen in an unexpected jukebox 
flashback — The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, “Sorry 
Ms. Jackson,” early Elvis, even that Robb Thomas and 
Santana shit you you always thought you hated. (But then 
why does it feel so good? And damn good.) Of course, 
there’s always the horrifying chance that lurking Botox 
victim with skeletor hands will subject the entire place to 
$20 worth of obscure Black Sabbath, or that a half-asleep 
cloud of patchouli oil will inadvertently purchase the same 
Sublime track five times in a row before drifting off to 
Rigoberto’s, but nothing’ll get you feeling more Tarantino 
than a halter top, quarter slot and not-so-golden oldie to 
work off your petty college-student sorrows.

Then again, you could always just hit the 7-Eleven park-
ing lot with “Down in Mexico” blaring from all four flap-
ping doors — cuz everyone gets a little cheaper after 2 a.m., 
when the rest of the world is just getting started.

Invaders Must Die
■ The Prodigy
TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL
AND COOKING VINYL

O ne of the original lords of rave back in the ’90s, British oldies the Prodigy return to the scene with Invaders 
Must Die — a vibrant, thrashing ode to 
heavy bass lines and razor-sharp synth. 
Mainly electronic and light on the lyrics 
— mostly in the form of a single phrase or 
chorus, repeatedly snarled over staccato 
rhythms — the album doesn’t pretend to 
be anything more than a soundtrack for 
alcohol-drenched, Ecstasy-fueled night-
time escapades. This lack of intellectual 
ambition is candy-covered yet welcome, 
allowing listeners to tune out the pillow 
talk and just dance.

Title track “Invaders Must Die” creeps 
into the club, backing a machine-gun 
disco beat with an eerie radio sample, 
buzzing with supernatural static. “Omen” 
follows the ghostly chorus — “It’s an 
omen/ The writing’s on the wall/ We 
won’t go away” — raising the weird and 
reaffirming Prodigy’s King Kong rave 
relevance. Occasional additions to stan-
dard synth and bass combinations are 
innovative, double-dosing the hot African 
drumming, slick keyboard backing and 
sampling so seamlessly it’d make your 
mother cry. 

But take Invaders outside the sweaty 
house jam and sparkling club scene, and 
you’ve got a wimpering orphaned puppy 
on your hands. Tracks contain little dis-
cernable variation and quickly wear out 
their welcome. Thank holy heroin that 
you’ll never need to leave the party. The 
Prodigy are free to do what any good rave 
does best: shovel in suburban addicts for 
the drug lords and all-night anthems for 
the dance queens.

The Bridge: Concept 
of a Culture
■ Grandmaster Flash
STRUT

T he founding architect of hip-hop has returned. After 20 years of slumbering, Grandmaster Flash embarks on a journey 
so magnanimous, only he could dare it. The 
Bridge: Concept of a Culture tries to “bridge” 
hip-hop from past to present — and with KRS-
One, DJ Kool and Big Daddy Kane along for 
the ride, it’s one of the most anticipated events 
of next-generation hip hop.

Bridge launches with Q-Tip making a guest 
appearance on “Shine All Day.” Flash splices 
violins under an Arabian flute, but undermines 
the art with a beat from Windows Music 
Creator. Q-Tip’s rhymes suffer as well: “When 
you’re around though girl I’m never weary/ 
Make me feel so good I get teary/ When I think 
about the love that we had.” 

The ‘woman’ he refers to is hip-hop — a 
novel idea, had Common not famously tackled 
it first. “Can I Take You Higher” is an old-
school joint harkening to “It’s Nasty,” though 
functioning only as a pale imitation. 

DJ Kool’s collab “Here Comes My DJ” hits 
high notes, paying tribute to the classic art of 
cutting ‘n’ scratching. “We Speak Hip Hop” 
gathers international emcees under KRS-One 
and backs them with erratic trumpet, modest 
snare and floor-tom. The finest gem is Busta 
Rhymes’ “Bounce Back,” which sees Flash final-
ly bridging eras, with techno beeps, a relentless 
high-hat and bursting dance bass decorated by 
Busta’s infectious and rapid delivery.

But Bridge contains a whopping 18 tracks 
— and the other unmentioned 13 are so unre-
markable that they deserve to be exiled. Had he 
been any other DJ, we would have given them 
the benefit of the doubt. But Flash’s stellar repu-
tation demands high expectations, and he falls 
miserably short. Even a team of Super Friends 
can’t save him now.

S ince their Pitchfork-trumpeted arrival in 2005, UK twee-pop duo the Boy Least Likely To has plagued cable connections, 
featured on everything from banking com-
mercials to calling-card ads. Here, ever-mis-
chievous Pete Hobbs and singer-songwriter 
Jof Owen have graduated from the unabash-
edly precious anthems off debut The Best Party 
Ever with The Law of the Playground, and are 
clearly enjoying the corners of their matured 
imagination.

Not much older but remarkably wiser, 
the boys master 13 banjo-laden tracks, com-
plete with whimsical nursery hooks and 
Yellow Submarine-worthy instrumentals. 
Nickelodeon-ready barnyard romp “Saddle 
Up” kicks things off with some cheek pinch-
ing, but not without acknowledging the “big 
scary world out there” over the cavity-forming 
pings of a xylophone. Cloaked in starry-eyed 
electronica, the folksy optimists build upon 
the adult anxieties of Party, as in the sinister, 
wound-licking imagery of “Whiskers.”

Dark undertones aside, the duo’s learned 
to layer noise like a macaroni necklace, mish-
mashing brass and kazoos to a Bop-It tour-
nament. Merry-go-round sing-a-longs fly by 
— “A Balloon On a Broken String” and “I Box 
Up All the Butterflies” lead the parade — to a 
violin jab and bass joust, finishing us off with 
anti-bully coup “Every Goliath Has Its David.” 
That’s right, shove that pencil up your nose and 
shout from the rooftop, “I’ve got puppy powers 
that I’m not afraid to use!”

Skip the snail-paced “The Nature of the 
Boy Least Likely To,” and drowsy-eyed “The 
Worm Forgives the Plough” — but any album 
that starts on warm fuzzies and ends with a 
“cookie and a hug” definitely deserves some 
love.

their murderous plans.
After a thousand escape attempts, an 

exhausting lineup of sadistic physical and men-
tal abuse and a car crash in the middle of no 
man’s land, the girls are thought to be dead. So 
the band of miscreants seeks shelter at the only 
light for miles — the last house on the left. 

Like every horror film posing as something 
poignant, “House” glosses over several horror-
movie tropes meant to showcase the relative 
normalcy of cold-blooded killers. We’re given 
a psychology lesson on the human psyche 
and its potential for evil, topped off with a 
juxtaposition of family dynamics, in which the 
Collingwoods’ sacrifice and love outshine the 
egoism of their criminal counterparts. And of 
course, a scary movie wouldn’t be complete 
without a lens careening down the female form 
in slow, sensual camerawork for some mild-
mannered, mid-scream fun and games. 

The film’s technical aspects are aestheti-
cally minded, with frequent zooms on haunting 
symbolic objects — Mari’s gold necklace, a 

ceramic sailboat, a boathouse buoy and Krug’s 
gun work as foreshadowing devices, with long 
pauses even inspiring some form of emphathy 
— to the credit of the relatively unknown cast’s 
believable acting. 

Made over by writer Adam Alleca to look 
and sound more realistic than its outdated pre-
decessor, the update largely succeeds, blurring 
time and place with frequent news reports that 
serve as jarring reality checks. 

Keeping suspense taut throughout, we’re 
forever guessing how the teenage incarnates 
will manage to pull through. And as the twisted 
plot scrunches tighter and tighter, the ending 
sneaks from behind with a final, unexpected 
stab.

“House” is a violent, bloody gorefest that 
leaves us feeling nauseous, bewildered and at 
an utter loss for words. But to see each filmic 
element working in unison, to watch a remake 
orchestrated with an intelligent eye and to 
witness Craven’s commentary on the darkest 
haunts of human behavior is worth at least one 
night’s unrest.

MEN’S TENNIS — The men’s tennis 
team took a break from its regular 
schedule over the weekend by par-
ticipating in the Pacific Coast Doubles 
Championship in La Jolla, one of ten-
nis’ most prestigious tournaments. 
Established in 1890, it is the second 
oldest tennis event in the U.S., with 
legends such as Jimmy Connors, John 
McEnroe and Arthur Ashe taking part 
in the past.

“This is definitely the biggest event 
our team gets a chance to take part 
of,” senior Kazumi Negishi said. “It’s 
always fun to get a chance to take a 
break from our team season and play 
in a tournament as individuals.”

Even head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
had the opportunity to compete, team-
ing up with former Triton tennis player 
Michael Meyer.  

In the first round, Steidlmayer and 
Meyer were taken down 6-2, 2-6, 5-7 
by the eighth-seeded team after domi-
nating the first set.

“To take a set off one of the top 
teams in the draw was definitely unex-
pected,” Steidlmayer said. 

In other first-round matches, soph-
omore Amaun Emami and freshman 
Chapman Chan were taken down by 
Miguel Garcia and Adiran Pena of 
Chula Vista 6-4, 6-2. The freshman 
team of Jake Fellow and Williams 

McCall also fell in two sets to Greg 
Failla, a former Association of Tennis 
Professionals tour player, and Duke 
Miller 6-2, 6-1.

As UCSD’s only seeded players, 
Negishi and sophomore Erik Elliot 
received a bye, advancing straight into 
the second round. Facing Brett Tobin 
and John Magliano of Villanova, the 
Tritons’ top doubles team routed 
their opponents 6-0, 6-0, assuring at 
least one UCSD win. With 32 teams 
left, the ninth-seeded team drew 
its first legitimate opponent in the 
third round, the sixth-seeded Charles 

Hoeveler and ex-Triton tennis player 
Bijan Moallemi. Elliot and Negishi 
were overmatched in the contest, fall-
ing 6-2, 6-1. 

Riding a four-game losing streak, 
the Tritons returned to their regular 
schedule on the road against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Wednesday. Last week, 
UCSD dropped a pair of home games 
against west regional opponent Hawaii 
Pacific University and Division-I 
Boston College.

ably said to his pitcher after being 
asked to redirect his attention. With 
Hobbs scrutinizing the radar gun, 
Shibuya’s next pitch clocked in at 91 
mph — impressive enough for Hobbs 
to pull head coach Dan O’Brien away 
from batting practice. Shibuya, now 
nervous and pumping with adrenaline 
in the sudden spotlight, threw the next 
pitch at 92 mph. When the coaches 
asked who he was, he responded, “I’m 
Tim from Wyoming.” They then sent 
him off to do some fieldwork. 

“It was quite a surprise, and a pleas-
ant surprise at that,” O’Brien said of 
Shibuya’s first impression. 

As it turned out, Shibuya’s decision 
to try out as a walk-on was a wise one, 
as he impressed the coaches enough to 
seal a spot on the roster in late winter.

“I didn’t know I made the team until 
they handed me a jersey,” Shibuya said. 

Shibuya started the 2008 regular 
season from the bullpen as a long 
reliever. He dominated opposing hit-
ters all year, carving the corners of the 
plate with explosive fastballs and an 
effortless delivery, while keeping them 
off balance with his breaking pitches. 
Over his first season, Shibuya com-
piled an 8-2 record with a 2.42 ERA in 
70.2 innings and struck out 61 batters. 
Following his impressive performance 
over the season, the freshman earned 
the 2008 Daktronics All-West Region 
and American Baseball Coaches 
Association/Rawlings Division-II All-
West Region Honors. 

“I’ve said this many times but he’s 
a great ball player — a solid pitcher 
but an even better guy — so we’re very 
lucky to have him in the program,” 
O’Brien said. “He’s very consistent; his 
work ethic is very consistent, his atti-
tude is very consistent and it’s not a 
coincidence that his performance on 
the mound is always very consistent. I 
think we could throw him pretty much 
in any role on this staff and he’d do a 
great job, and that’s what makes him 
special.”

Shibuya’s arsenal consists of a high 
80s to low 90s fastball, a nasty slider, 
and a solid change-up — a repertoire 
of pitches that has given the sopho-
more success during his second season. 

“Coach Hobbs has been doing a 
great job of sticking to our fastballs for 
two or three innings, then going to our 
off-speed pitches,” Shibuya said. “But 
working off our fastballs has been key, 
just working in and out.”

O’Brien dismisses the idea that 
Shibuya simply overpowers hitters 
with the speed of his pitches.

“What makes him special is his 
location of his fastball and the fact that 
he trusts his fastball,” O’Brien said. “A 
lot of people want to talk about the 
velocity of his fastball, but the big thing 
is he trusts his fastball and works off 
his fastball.”

A key part of UCSD’s bullpen last 
season, Shibuya began the 2009 cam-
paign in the starting rotation.

“About the only difference is that 
when I pitch, I know I’m not going to 
pitch in the game following,” he said. 
“I was in long relief last year and I had 
four- or five-inning games. So after the 
first inning it’s just like coming out of 
the bullpen, which is how I look at it. 
Now I have to set the table myself to 
get to the bullpen, which is phenom-
enal again this year.”

As for Shibuya’s post college plans?
“Maybe grad school, a teaching 

degree or if I’m not too sick of school 
maybe med school,” Shibuya said. 

The chemistry major and Revelle 
College student hasn’t ruled out the 
possibility of playing baseball after his 
Triton years, either. 

“You know, if something happens 
with that [Major League Baseball 
draft] I’ll give it a shot, but I can’t think 
too much about it,” he said. “It’s defi-
nitely too much of a long shot to even 
worry about that.” 

O’Brien, however, isn’t quite as 
humble about his pitcher’s credentials.

“If he keeps doing what he’s doing 
in terms of improvement, I think he 

has a chance to play at the next level,” 
he said.

As far as the team goes, 2008 was 
disappointing because UCSD’s season 
ended earlier than the team would 
have liked. Every year, O’Brien preach-
es on focusing simply on ending up 
in North Carolina for the National 
Championship.

“We have a lot of pride in being 
a very tough team to play,” O’Brien 
said. “We’re going to grind it out every 
day. We’re going to grind it out every 
inning. We’re not only going to be a 
team that plays great baseball but we’re 
also going to be mentally tough. And 
whether we win or lose we’re going to 
put up a heck of a fight.”

O’Brien’s philosophy has appar-
ently rubbed off on Shibuya. 

“We’re just going to methodically 
grind out the season until we get to 
that CCAA tourney, to the Regional 
tourney and eventually to the National 
Championship,” Shibuya said.

While Shibuya is now accustomed 
to playing ball in California, San 
Diego’s big-city lifestyle has been a 
harder adjustment for the pitcher. 

“The biggest difference is how 
many damn people there are,” Shibuya 
said. “It drives me nuts half the time. 
My work is 25 miles away back home 
and it takes me 20 minutes to get there. 
I am a fishing guide and work in a fish-
ing shop back home. It’s a little differ-
ent way of life.”

If his entrance music is any indica-
tion — Shibuya takes the mound to 
the country song “What Do Ya Think 
About That” by Montgomery Gentry 
— the pitcher has been successful in 
bringing his small-town lifestyle to 
UCSD baseball. Playing the game with 
the same attitude as the lyrics to his 
chosen song, “I don’t give a darn what 
other people think,” Shibuya brings a 
little Wyoming to California both on 
and off the field, country-style.

Baseball Falls in Trio 
of One-Run Contests
By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

BASEBALL — UCSD experienced two 
vastly different series over the last cou-
ple of weeks, leading to near-opposite 
results. 

After blowing out Cal State Los 
Angeles in three out of four games Feb. 
26 through Feb. 28 — outscoring the 
Golden Eagles 34-8 in the wins — the 
No. 23 Tritons fell to the Seawolves in 
three consecutive one-run ball games 
on the road March 7 and 8 before pull-
ing out a squeaker 
in the series finale to 
avoid the sweep. 

“Having one-
run games doesn’t 
really happen all the 
time,” senior start-
ing pitcher Trevor 
Decker said. “It was 
a shock the way 
things worked out. 
We had a few bad 
breaks and didn’t 
execute.”

The Tritons will 
again face a tough 
opponent, hosting No. 1 Cal State 
Stanislaus this weekend.

“We’re not going to spend a whole 
lot of time worrying about Cal State 
Stanislaus,” head coach Dan O’Brien 
said. “We need to get better at playing 
the game, get back to fundamentals.”

Not only did the Tritons fall in 
three straight close matches, they lost 
all of them in heartbreaking fashion. 
With two out and nobody on and 
the game tied at one in the bottom 
of the ninth in the opening game of 
the series, sophomore starting pitcher 
Tim Shibuya walked a Seawolf batter. 
Redshirt junior Sean Greer then came 
in to relieve the starter and hit the first 
batsman he saw, putting runners on 

first and second and setting the stage 
for Sonoma’s walk-off single. 

“It was a strange series,” O’Brien 
said. “There was definitely a lot of 
good pitching and it was going to come 
down to who played better defense and 
had timely hitting. We just gave them 
too many runs. Our defense did not 
play well behind good pitching.”

With UCSD down 3-2 in the sec-
ond game, senior second baseman 
Garrett Imeson singled to start off 
the ninth inning. UCSD put runners 
on first and third with one out, but 

Imeson was thrown 
out at the plate as he 
attempted to score 
on a ground ball.

The Tritons had 
a chance to tie the 
game once again in 
the ninth inning of 
the the third match 
when senior Josh 
Tanner singled 
with two outs, but 
they were unable to 
drive him in, lead-
ing to a series loss 
for UCSD.

“At that point, you just try to stay 
positive and focus on process of game 
and not results,” O’Brien said.

With one game left in the four-
game set, the Tritons handed the ball to 
Decker to help salvage a victory.

“My mentality going into the game 
was to keep the team within strik-
ing distance and let the offense come 
around and pick us up,” Decker said.

Decker kept it close and, with the 
game tied at two, junior outfielder 
Robert Sedin drove in the winning run 
in extra innings. Sophomore Guido 
Knudson earned the win in relief.

door on UCSD at a 30-26 score. 
With late momentum in the third 

set carrying over to the fourth, the 
Tritons put the pressure back on the 
Waves and stepped up their game in 
a set that saw the score tied 15 times. 
Redshirt sophomore outside hitter 
Will Ehrman broke a 10-10 tie, send-
ing down back-to-back aces to give 
the Tritons a 12-10 lead. After the 
Waves fought back to tie the set again, 
sophomore middle back Calvin Ross 
threw down two consecutive kills to 
put the Tritons ahead 27-25. Ross put 
the set away on a kill and forced a fifth 
set at 30-28. 

Pepperdine opened up to a 7-4 
lead in the final set, but UCSD tied it 
up after a Spangler kill, a Pepperdine 
error and a Triton ace. Trailing 10-9, 
Pepperdine went on a small tear, tak-
ing a 14-12 lead. Senior middle back 
Gerald Houseman and sophomore set-
ter Phil Bannan put up a block to add 
another point for the Tritons and make 
the score 14-13. Pepperdine proved to 
be a bit too tall a task for the Tritons, as 
the Waves held onto the slim lead, clos-
ing the game and set at 15-13. 

“I think we were able to stun them 
by coming out strong at the begin-
ning of the match,” Ehrman said. “As 
they steadied out, we faced one of 
the best blocking teams in the league. 
However, Jason [Spangler] and Gerald 
[Houseman] were on fire all night 
so they kept us in the game with big 
swings. When it came down to it, they 
just came up a little bigger than us at 
the end of game five.”

Houseman sent down 19 kills on 
.464 hitting in the game with junior 
opposite hitter Frank Fritsch and Ross 
contributing 12 each. Senior libero Eric 
Leserman led the Tritons with 13 digs, 
and Bannan finished the night with 67 
assists, nine digs, three aces, three kills 
and three blocks. UCSD served up 10 
aces, with three apiece coming from 
Ehrman and Bannan. 

Despite the loss to the Waves, the 

Tritons put up an impressive display 
against what was at the time the sec-
ond-ranked team in the country. Still, 
Friday night’s upset over No. 5 USC 
was UCSD’s highlight of the week.

“Coming off of the UCLA win, 
we had a really solid week of practice 
and felt really confident going into 
the match with USC,” Ehrman said. 
“We were able to get our serves going 
really early, especially Phil [Bannan]. 
We outpassed them all night, and most 
importantly, we were able to complete-
ly neutralize their best player, Murphy 
Troy, with our block.”

In front of 300 fans packed inside 
RIMAC Arena, UCSD looked to carry 
momentum from its Feb. 28 sweep of 

UCLA into the matchup with USC. 
Ehrman led the Tritons in a game 
where four players racked up double 
digits. Ross had a game-high 12 blocks 
while Bannan piled up 46 assists, 
eight blocks, six digs and three aces. 
Spangler recorded 13 kills, nine digs 
and four blocks in the game.

“They were very intense matches, 
and it was good to see so many fans in 
the crowd cheering us on,” Houseman 
said. “If we keep playing at a high level 
I feel that playoffs are definitely within 
grasp.”

The Tritons exploded in the first set 
to take a 10-6 lead. UCSD led 17-15 
before the Trojans went on a five-point 
tear to take a 20-17 lead, sucking all the 

momentum out of UCSD. The Tritons 
pulled within one point, but USC took 
advantage of a UCSD error and its own 
kills. UCSD fought back aggressively 
on offense, which proved to be too 
tough for USC, allowing the Tritons to 
take the set 30-26. 

“We were able to attack them all 
night, and things really seemed to be 
going our way,” Ehrman said. “It was 
just a really good night for us as a team.”

In the second set, the Tritons 
jumped out to a 19-12 lead, led by two 
Ross blocks and an Ehrman kill. USC 
pulled within two, but a Bannan and 
Ross block stopped the Trojans’ run to 
give UCSD a three-point lead. Ehrman 
sent down the match point for a win.

The third set was a back-and-forth 
battle that included 19 ties and four 
lead changes. The final tie came at 28 
before Fritsch sent down a kill to force 
a match point. Spangler sent down the 
final kill for the win at 30-28.

The Tritons took total control early 
in the fourth, opening up to a 14-7 
lead after an Ehrman ace. The Trojans 
would not go down without a fight, 
climbing within two points on multiple 
occasions. With the Tritons leading 
26-24, two USC errors put UCSD in 
a favorable position. Ehrman finished 
off the final set of the game with a kill 
and a score of 30-26.

The win marks UCSD’s first over 
USC since its 2007 campaign. After a 
slow start, wins over UCLA and USC 
have turned UCSD’s season around, 
giving the Tritons a shot at the playoffs. 
UCSD has posted a 2-2 record so far in 
its biggest test of the season — a tough 
schedule of consecutive MPSF match-
ups that is nearly over. 

In the win over USC, Spangler 
became the third Triton in school his-
tory to record at least 1,000 career kills. 
The junior from Thousand Oaks now 
has 1,027 career kills, 74 away from the 
all-time mark.

SOFTBALL TAKES TWO 
WINS IN TRIPLEHEADER
By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

SOFTBALL — Because of the toll that 
catching ball games takes on a player’s 
knees, catchers in the major leagues 
usually get the second game of a dou-
bleheader off. In the Tritons’ triple-
header victory against the Seawolves 
over the weekend, junior catcher 
Nicole Saari had no such luck, helping 
UCSD to victory the hard way.

After a doubleheader on March 
6 at Sonoma State was cancelled due 
to poor weather, the Tritons (12-9, 
6-5 CCAA) and Seawolves (8-12, 6-9 
CCAA) played three straight games 
the following day, with UCSD posting 
easy victories in the opening and final 
games of the set to take the series win.

Along with several other Tritons, 
Saari started all three games for 
UCSD, catching the bookend matches 
and playing first base for the middle 
one.

“I’m glad we won the last game 
— we were tired out by the end of it,” 
Saari said. “I’ve never played three 
games in one day, at least in not in 
my college career. You actually get to 
know the other team pretty well, play-
ing them three times in a row.”

Coming off a 3-1 loss to defending 
national champion Humboldt State in 
a four-game set the previous weekend, 
the Tritons were ready to take a series 
win any way they could get it.

“We were definitely disappointed 
with our series against Humboldt and 
we wanted to go in there and take it 
out on Sonoma to turn around our 
momentum,” Saari said.

Following the road win, UCSD 
returns home to face Cal State 
Stanislaus March 13 and 14 for a four-
game set.

 “We expect close games because 
our whole league is so close this 

year,” Saari said. “They have a better 
record than us but that’s not intimi-
dating. We know we can go in there 
and sweep them and that’s what our 
goal is.”

The Triton offense burst from the 
gates against Sonoma State in the first 
game, bolstered by four-run innings 
in the second and the sixth. The game 
ended after the sixth as UCSD secured 
a 9-1 mercy-rule victory.

“It was really important to have 
the good start to the series,” senior 
first baseman Jenni Habib said. “We 
played as strong as we have all season. 
It set the tone and let us know that we 
were back in our game.”

After the offensive outburst in 
the opening match, the Triton line-
up struggled to put up runs against 
the Seawolves in the second game 
of the day. UCSD managed just four 
hits against Sonoma State’s Brittany 
Reynolds, eventually falling 2-1.

“I think what happened was that 
we just got in our heads a little bit too 
much,” Habib said of the Triton bat-
ters in the second game. “We let the 
umpires dictate the game instead of 
taking it in our own hand and attack-
ing the ball.”

Senior starting pitcher Lauren 
Chastain and Seawolf starting pitcher 
Lindsay Emmel were locked in an 
impressive pitcher’s duel through six 
innings of the final game, with neither 
of them giving up a run. 

Saari led off in the seventh, reach-
ing first base on an error. Habib then 
stepped up to the plate, ripping a 
triple to right field that plated sopho-
more utility Megan Grace, who was 
pinch running for Saari. The Tritons 
added four more runs, en route to a 
5-0 win.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — For the first 
time since 2007, the UCSD men’s vol-
leyball team defeated the University 
of Southern California (12-5, 9-4 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) 
on March 6. The No. 8 Tritons (8-10, 
4-9 MPSF) served the No. 5 Trojans 
a 3-1 loss (30-26, 30-25, and 30-26), 
proving themselves a serious threat 
in the conference. The Tritons almost 
pulled off another upset against an 
MPSF powerhouse the next night, but 
ultimately fell to No. 3 Pepperdine 
University after five sets. 

UCSD will finish its stretch of 
consecutive conference home games 
this week against No. 12 University 
of Hawaii (4-11, 3-9 MPSF) March 13 
and March 14 in RIMAC Arena at 7 
p.m. The Tritons look to defeat Hawaii 
for the first time in UCSD history, as 
they stand 0-36 all-time against the 
Warriors.

Heading into the Pepperdine game 
with another winless all-time record 
(0-34) against the Waves (12-2, 11-2 
MPSF), the Tritons were poised to pull 
off the upset of the year. After trump-
ing USC and UCLA and competing 
in front of a packed house at RIMAC 
Arena, the perfect stage was set for an 
unprecedented Triton upset.

Despite being outblocked by a 
22.0-8.5 margin, the Tritons forced the 
game into five sets. Junior outside hit-
ter Jason Spangler’s impressive perfor-
mance — which included 24 kills and 
11 digs — sparked the Tritons’ offen-
sive attack, with 10 of his kills coming 
in the first set which the Tritons won. 

Pepperdine reminded everyone 
why it’s the third best team in the 
nation, pulling away in the second after 
a 12-12 tie and cruising to a 30-20 win.

The Waves continued their domi-
nation into the third set, leading 19-10 
before UCSD mustered a 10-4 run to 
pull the deficit within three. However, 
the Tritons could not complete the 
comeback, and Pepperdine closed the 

F amous for its beautiful green forests, snow-capped peaks and blue rivers, Wyoming isn’t exactly a hotbed for baseball players 
or any athletes beyond skiers, snowboarders and 
mountain climbers. Conversely, California car-
ries some of the best sports competition every 
year, from Little League to collegiate baseball. It’s 
extremely unusual for a baseball player to move 
from Wyoming to California and still manage to 
dominate the tough West Coast competition. Tim 
Shibuya is anything but usual.

The Jackson native and UCSD sophomore 
attended Jackson Hole High School, where he 
graduated from a class of 650. His town’s popula-
tion of 8,000 is less than one-fourth of UCSD’s 
student population. Facing limited competition, 
Shibuya batted .440 as a high-school senior along 
with 10 home runs and 25 stolen bases. He also 
tossed 70 innings with a 1.00 earned run average 
and 140 strikeouts. In his junior year, Shibuya 
threw 60 innings, compiling 100 strikeouts and a 
1.30 ERA. While his incredible stats would have 
easily translated into a Division-II scholarship 

had he posted them in California, Shibuya went 
unnoticed.

Before coming to college, Shibuya was only 
clocked on a radar gun once, and he hit 88 mph. 
He claims it to be a fluke, however, because some 
of his teammates were clocking in at 94 mph 
when none of them could normally top 82. 

“I figured that [radar reading] was a line drive 
off of a bat or something,” Shibuya said. It turns 
out the radar gun’s reading on Shibuya’s fastball 
— which now hits the upper 80s and lower 90s 
with regularity — was probably correct. 

Despite excelling in baseball at the high-
school level, when it came down to choosing a 
college, the 5-foot-11-inch, 180-pound sopho-
more set his sights on a UC campus in order to 
pursue chemistry and experience West Coast liv-
ing. He already planned on applying to UC Davis 
and UCLA, but never considered UCSD until the 
school was suggested to his dad, a ski instructor, 
by some clients of his from Del Mar. 

“I said ‘why not,’ since I was already going to 
apply to UC Davis and UCLA. So I figured I’ll 

just check the UCSD box,” Shibuya said.
Once he was accepted, Shibuya decided to 

give baseball a shot. 
“I e-mailed coach Addison, and asked if they 

had walk-on tryouts,” he said. “He said yes, so I 
just decided to try out. I didn’t expect to make it, 
but I figured I might as well give it a shot because 
you never know what could happen.” 

On the first day of field maintenance — a pre-
tryout activity — Shibuya showed up in a worn 
shirt and a pair of jeans, immediately setting 
himself apart from the group of Triton baseball 
hopefuls clad mostly in athletic attire, and looked 
like a long shot to make the team. That was until 
he threw his first bullpen. Senior pitcher Trevor 
Decker held the radar gun while pitching coach 
Matt Hobbs was watching a 6’5” lefty he recruited 
heavily. But Shibuya’s first few pitches clocked in 
at an astonishing 88 mph and 89 mph, prompting 
Decker to pull Hobbs over to check it out. 

“This best be good Decker,” Hobbs presum-

WATER POLO — The No. 19 Triton 
women relieved some pent-up stress 
and frustration this past weekend at the 
UC Santa Barbara Invitational tourna-
ment. Against top-notch in-state com-
petition, UCSD (5-11, 1-2 Western 
Water Polo Association) finished the 
tournament with a 2-2 record and 
returned home with renewed hopes for 
the remainder of the season.

In their first matchup, the Tritons 
faced off against Bucknell University, 
from Pennsylvania, and steadily over-
came the Bisons 10-7. Through two 
quarters, the score was tied at two, but 
a relentless scoring drive led by senior 
attacker and team captain Sydney 
Gstettenbauer, who had four goals in 
the game, helped the Tritons shut out 
their opponents in the second quarter 
and score three unanswered goals, tak-
ing a 5-2 lead into halftime.

“We were able to do some stuff that 
we should have been doing all season,” 
Gstettenbauer said. “We eliminated 
some of our mistakes and played well.”

Bucknell was not ready to tuck 
tail and call it quits after a poor sec-

ond quarter showing, however. The 
Bisons returned with a scoring flurry 
of their own, closing the gap to 7-6 by 
the fourth quarter. Desperate to avoid 
another fourth-quarter meltdown — 
an-all-too-common occurence this 
season — junior goalkeeper Markayla 
Quane allowed just one goal in the 
quarter while the Tritons scored three 
times to earn a three-point victory. 
Freshman attacker Jessica Tran and 
junior attacker Audra Bloom each 
scored two goals in the match.

In their second match on Saturday, 
the Tritons faced No. 6 San Diego State 
in what proved to be an overwhelming 
battle. The Aztecs came out strong in 
the match, outscoring the Tritons 5-2 
in the first quarter en route to a 9-3 
halftime lead. The break provided little 
relief and the Aztecs continued their 
dominating performance in the second 
half, ending the match in a 16-6 blow-
out. Leading scorer Gstettenbauer was 
shut down in the game, unable to con-
nect on any of her few shot attempts. 

“They had a person guarding 
me really tough through the game,” 
Gstettenbauer said. 

With Gstettenbauer contained, 
freshman hole set Kirsten Bates’ three 

goals were not nearly enough to boost 
UCSD’s anemic offense.

On the second day of competi-
tion, the Tritons wrangled with No. 
13 UCSB. The Gauchos appeared to 
have an early edge, taking a 2-1 lead in 
the first quarter; however, the Tritons 
fought back to tie the score at three 
by halftime. It was a close third quar-
ter, with the Gauchos outscoring the 
Tritons by a slim 3-2 margin. 

The Gauchos’ offense proved too 
much of a force for the Tritons to deal 
with in the final period. Despite mul-
tiple goals by offensive standouts Tran 
and Gstettenbauer, the Tritons fell 8-5 
in their first match on Sunday.

The Tritons were given an oppor-
tunity for sweet revenge in their final 
game of the tournament, facing No. 
16 Cal State Long Beach for the fourth 
time this season. Having lost three 
straight times to the 49ers, the Tritons 
were seeking redemption.

“We really needed to win this one,” 
Gstettenbauer said. “They play dirty.”

The hours of reviewing tape in 
practice from previous games against 
the 49ers paid off as an outpour of 
Triton goals dominated the second 
period, giving the team a 6-2 lead at 

the halftime. The Tritons came out 
tired in the third quarter, and the 49ers 
looked poised for another comeback, 
similar to their earlier confrontation in 
the UC Irvine tournament this season. 
Long Beach outscored the Tritons 5-1 
in the third quarter and was push-
ing for another overtime game or last 
minute victory. The Tritons’ defense 
did not play nearly as well as in the first 

half, however. With just enough of an 
offensive push, UCSD used its big first 
half lead to hold off the 49ers for the 
11-10 victory Sunday afternoon.

Next, the Tritons face Occidental 
College on March 12 at 3 p.m. at 
Canyonview Pool.
