UC Regents visit San 
Diego campus, hospital 

By GAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

As part of its first formal visit 
to the UCSD campus since 1999, 
the UC Board of Regents anenel-
ed di cus ions on accommodating 
campus growth and the progress 
of health cience that were pre-
sented by faculty and rudents on 
peb. 26 at Thornton Hospital. 

While the focus of the day was 
on the ways U D is growing 
both physically and in the domain 
of health sciences, :Ij,! issue of 
U labor practice was also 
brought to the Regents during 
the public comment ccnon of 
the meeong. Four speakers, all 
employees of D, voiced their 
demands for an mcrease in wages 
and fairness on the C end of the 

negotiating table. 
One speaker, a member of the 

Coalition of University 
Employees, addressed the 
Regents on the same day that the 
union, which has not succeeded 
in obtaining the 15 percent 
increase in wages it asked the 
University of California for, 
joined UC Council-AFT in 
protest on seven UC campuses. 

Another peaker who partici-
pated in the protests, UCSD 
Cancer Center taff Resource 

ssociate arolan Buckmaster, 
argued that the University of 
California's bargaining tech-
niques were unfair and that the 
low wages resulted in a high taff 
rurnover rate.

Regents: Talks address campus growth 
conlinued from page I 

"This kind of regressive bar-
gaining has happened time and 
time again," Buckmaster said. 

Dynes welcomed the input. 
"I embrace [the speakers] for 

bei ng open and honest," said 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes fol-
lowing the meeting. "T hese are 
legitimate concerns that exist on 
our campus." 

During the meeting, Dynes 
addressed the Regents a bout the 
changes on the UCSD campus 
since thei r last visit. 

"These are certainly not good 
til11l"s; UCSD will pick up about 
one-sixth of the growth of the UC 
system," Dynes said of the current 
economy. "We expect not to main -
tain excellence, but to increase it 
throughout the growth process, 
and that's goi ng to be difficult." 

Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning John 
Woods spoke about the growth of 
the UCSD campu and the mea-
sures being taken to accommo-
date it. According to Woods, in 
1989, UCSD had estimated that 
it would enroll 25,500 students 
by the year 2005; today, planning 
has increased that estimate by 
6,500. Parking space estimates 
suffered a si mil ar increa e, jump-
ing from 25,230 to 27,200. 
Woods said he is also working on 
UCSD's goal to house between 
40 and 50 percelH of students on 
campus, which will include new 
housing by 2005. 

"We need adequate state sup-
POrt ," Woods said. "We are 
depending on the state for core 
support, including building and 
infrastrucnlre." 

I lowever, according to Woods, 
the univerSity IS finding ways to 
face the budget challenge by find-
i ng priva te funds to construcl new 
buildings on ca mpus, pointi ng to 

the Powell -Faught bioengineering 
hall that opened this year. 

Woods stressed the importance 
of keeping the university's open 
spaces, including the park 
reserves. 

"This area has gotten more and 
more urban, and we think people 
will soon turn to UCSD as an 
oasis," Woods said. "But even in 
UCSD, we have set aside and wi ll 
keep reserves." 

He also addressed plans to make 
the University Center increasingly 
important to campus life. 

"We're going to make sure in 
the years to come that this area 
becomes a hub of activity," Woods 
said. 

" We are depending on the 
state far care support, 
including building and 

infrastructure. " 
-John Woods 

Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning 

Transportation and parking, 
according to Woods, is also a 
problem for campus planning. 

"We worry that in the long 
run, it could affect our ability to 
recruit faculty and staff," Woods 
said, adding that he hoped San 
Diego transportation would be 
improved so that the land planned 
for parking could be used for 
building. 

Woods also mentioned plans 
for a new addition to the Stuart 
Collection, which would be locat-
ed by the bioengineering building. 

The health sc iences discussion 

featured both facu lty and students 
from the School of Medicine, who 
focused on their work and visions 
of a cross-disciplinary future for 
medicine at UCSD. 

"We need to tear down barriers 
that prevent interdisciplinary 
approaches, " said professor of 
medicine Edward Holmes, intro-
ducing a presentation on the 
College of Integrated Life 
Sciences. "The purpose of 
C.O.I.L.S is to rea lly engender 
and enhance cross-disciplinary 
research and patient care." 

David Merrill , an MD candi-
date, spoke about his own inter-
disciplinaty research. 

"The best thing about being at 
UCSD is that ['ve been able to 
collaborate with people from all 
over campus in my research," 
Merrill said. 

Dynes said he felt that the 
Regents had been impressed with 
the presentations. 

Several Regents asked ques-
tions about specific research. 

"I don't mean to seem cynical, 
but I wonder how much this 
cross-disciplinary approach is 
related to funding," asked Regent 
Velma Montoya. 

Several members of the faculty 
replied that they felt that there 
was funding, but only because 
there was a real need for physi-
cians with these sorts of back-
grounds. 

"1 think the Regents were 
blown away," Dynes said. "Not so 
much by the faculty, but by the 
medical students, who are terrif-
ic." 

The Regents' two-day visit will 
continue on Feb. 27 with presen-
tations on research, teaching, 
community service, the California 
Cultures Initiative and homeland 
security topics, accompanied again 
by public comments.

UCSC faculty votes to 
oppose war with Iraq 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Staff Writer 

The UC Santa Cruz Academic 
Senate unanimously passed a resolu-
tion opposing a "unilateral preemp-
tive war against Iraq" during its win-
ter quarter meeting on Feb. 19. The 
vote was 58-0, with two members 
abstaining. 

The resolution, brought forth by 
assistant professor Paul Ortiz, also 
urges the U.S. government to "work 
with the United Nations to obtain 
compliance from Iraq." Through 
the resolution, the UCSC Academic 
Senate was able to establish con-
cerns regarding the impending war. 

The resolution has drawn 
responses from other California 
campuses. 

"We're starting to hear back 
from different universities about 
passi ng the same kind of resolution," 
Ortiz said. 

The effect of the resolution is 
being felt throughout the UCSC 
campus and the co llege communi-
ties at large. 

"The intended impact of the 
resolution on the campus is to 
impart a sense of shared concern, 
as well as to inform the campus 
community on the specific issues," 
said Academic Senate Secretary 
David Belanger. 

Ortiz and other faculty members 
had been worlcing on the resolution 
si nce the end of fall quarter and for-
mulated amendments prior to the 
vote. Written support from 11 2 out 
of the Academic Senate's 637 mem-
bers was received prior to the meet-
ing. However, the expected pull of 
the resolution is not clear. 

According to Ortiz, the 
Academic Senate was not W1der the 
illusion that the resolution alone will 

put a stop to war. It is a way for edu-
catOrs to try to "get the campus 
communi ty, the U niver~ity of 
California system and society at 
large to reflect" on the dangers of a 
preemptive war against Iraq. 

The controversial aspects of the 
resolution have also prompted the 
question of whether it was an appro-
priate decision for an Academic 
Senate of a public school institution 
to make. However, supporters point 
to the resolution tatement thal 
UCSC will be Signifi cantly impacted 
through the redirection of resources 
from education to warfare. 

Additionally, the resolution states 
that the war in Iraq "would interfere 
with numerous university interna-
tional initiatives and programs." 

"Students from the UC, Cal State 
University systems and community 
colleges are struggling," Ortiz aid. 
"Where are all the resources that 
could be devoted for financial aid 
and to reduce class sizes?" 

Others feel that the resolution 
sterns from a long tradition of facul-
ty members from the UniverSity of 
California making an effort 10 give 
advice to the federal, state and local 
governments. 

"It is in times of crisi and con-
troversy that the scholarly expertise 
of the UC 
faculty can be most helpful to society 
and government," Belanger said. 

Standlllg United for Peace, a 
UCSC student anti-war organiza-
tion, was first to bring up the idea of 
a resolution against the war to facul-
tymembers. 

Even though no speCific action 
is mandated by the resolution, 
according to Belanger, the Senate's 
purpose in passi ng it was to voice 
the principles held by the UCSC 
faculty.

A.S. spending 
limit removal was 

right decision 
The 2003 A .. elections will nm much 

differently than in past year. C President 
Richard C. Atkin on announced recently 
that he would di continue UC D's (and 
other campuses') traditional practice of lim-
iting the amount of money a rudent gov-
ernment candidate can spend on campaign 
materials. ow students of means can spend 
however much they like on their bids for an 
A. . position. 

ampaign finance issues are hotly debated 
on the nanonal cene, and this will undoubt-
edlv cau e controversy on campus as well. 

tVe would like to commend the AS. 
Council for pa sing legislation calling for vol-
untary pending limltS. Following in the 
foot tep of CaIifornia election, future A . 
candidates will be asked to voluntarily sign a 
contract under which they would voluntarily 
limit their pending to pre et lilTIlts, This 
strikes a nice balance between the legal need 
for no limits and the need to level the playing 
field with spending caps. 

The A. . Council showed a lot of strength 
in not quickly giving in to public pressure and 
abandoning the limItS altogether, They stuck 
by their beliefs and struck a compromJ e that 
allowed them to anempt to keep some type 
of limits intact. We commend them for that. 

However, the Guardian would Ijke to point 
out a few flaws that could cause great contro-
versy in the future of A.S. elections. 

First, the A.S, Council insists on not only 
listing which candidates opted for the spend-
ing limit at the top of the ballot, but also on 
branding each candidate with his or her 
choice on the maner. Next to each candidate's 
name witl be a statement whether he or she 
decided to accept or decline the voluntary 
spending limit. While some argue that thjs is 
just a statement of fact, it is not the council's 
place to place a negative stereotype on a can-
didate. The courts have ruled repeatedly that 
when "incentives" to accept ~pending limits 
turn into "coercion" to accept them, then it 
becomes illegal. It would be acceptable if only 
those who accepted the limits received labels' 
on the ballot~, but once those who did not 
sign up for the voluntary limits get publicl}1 
branded for it, it becomes highly questionable 
in legaltty. 

The second issue is the seemingl), large 
loophole in the bylaws that would allow 
like-minded individuals to pend money a~ 
individual~ while pooling money together 
lib: slate~. There is a provision for the AS 
elections manager to review hese cases. 

Ba~ed on his judgement, he can, in effect, 
make people become slates, but this ~ets up 
a dangerous precedent in which individuals 
could be branded a slate when it wa not 
their intention to become one. By doing ~(), 
the council would deny those individual~ 
their constitutional right not to associate 
with other people, an i..,sue the court ha 
been very intent on over the year~ .

We're forced to find ways to fight fear 
American people put up with war propaganda 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Staff Wnter 

More than a year after the fateful 
Twin Towers attack, Americans are sl1l1 
consumed by the unlikely possibility 
that they tOO will be slain at the hands 
of terroriSts. The inhabitants of the so-
called home of the free are now 
obsessed with survival against a nebu-
lous, inSIdIOUS enemy, and this ob es-
sion is being fed by the media and the 
White House, both of which benefit 
&om maintaining a perpetual environ-
ment of fear. 

Over the past year and a half, these 
two institutions have emerged as 
hameless fear-mongering machines 

with a vested interest in keeping the 
American public as scared as possible. 
The medIa make money by selhng fear 
to their viewers - fear of flesh-eating 
viruses, rabId dogs, gun-wielding 
schoolchildren, axe murderers, killer 
bees, crooked Insurance salesman and 
the like. Then came Sept. II , which, 
it's faIr to say, frightened every 
American out of hl~ or her skll1, and 
now the mecha machine I~ profiung by

TItURSOAY, FEBRUARY 27, ZOO) THE UCSD GUARDIAt{ 

Marches deserve consideration 
Protestors petition president's position 

By JESSICA LlNGEL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

For years, I've been exercising 
my right to protest. I've walked in 
candlelight vigils to raise awareness 
for drunk driving, carried banners 
for feminist organizations and 
chanted mantras down mainstreets 
to combat gun control. I like 
marches - they let me realize my 
autonomy as a citizen and allow me 
to connect with people who believe 
in the same things that I do. 

This last march was a bit differ-
ent. 

I'm referring to the protests of 
Feb. IS and Feb. 16. These march-
es were absolutely amazing. For 
one thing, there were millions of 
people taking part all over the 
world. From Rome, to Paris, to 
London, to dozens of locations all 
over the United States, people were 
voicing their objections to war. But 
there wa more to this cxtraordi-
nary demonstration than the sheer 
number of protestors, like the sheer 
number of protest perspectives. 
There were dozens of different 
causes, but only one goal: to publi -
cize public antipathy to the war. 

My sister and r decided to 
attend the San Francisco protest 
that took place on Feb. 16. 
Whereas the other 3S0-plus cities 
participating in the worldwide 
demonstration had declared their 
sentiments on Feb. 15, the San 
Francisco march took place the 
following day due to the fact thar 
Sarurday was booked for a celebra-
tion of Chinese New Year, so it wa 
already off to an individualist start 
long before the march between the 
Civic Center and the Embarcadero 
began. But that didn 't keep people 
from doing what they came to do. 

People of all backgrounds and 
ideologies were present. providing a 

COMMENTARY 
spectacle of fantastic proportions. 
Personal favorites included hand-
painted signs carried by two yOWlg 
girls that likened the president to 
the villain of the Harry Potter sto-
ries: "Bush 2 Voldemort;" and a 
new version of the childhood clas-
sic, "If You're Happy and You 
Know It." The new lyrics go some-
thing like this; "If we can't find 
Osam3, bomb Iraq. If the economy 
downed your mama, bomb Iraq. If 
the oi l fields are calling and the 
opinion polls .are falling and if Bush 
is feeling jolly, bomb lraq." Thi 
clever little ditty was sung by a 
group of elderly women who had 
traveled up q-om Santa Cruz to join 
the San Francisco festivities. 

And "festivities" is perhaps the 
best word to summarize the mood. 
There was an underlying theme 
that, regardless of how many peo-
ple fervently opposed military 
engagement, this war had become 
inevitable. For most, marching 
wasn't about getting President 
George W. Bush's attention. I'm 
not naive enough to think that 
Bush would flip the channel to 
CNN (presumably during com-
mercials for theJ ohn Wayne cine-

matic success "The Lucky Texanj 
and suddenly be convinced that 
war isn't the way to go just because 
he saw the clips of protesters in 
San Francisco. Protesting wasn't a 
matter of political persuasion, but 
a manner of finding solidarity. 

Despite the myriad causes, there 
was a huge sensation of together-
ness - a feeling that there is in fact 
3 certain amount of power of the 
people. The peacefulness of these 
protests was almost unheard of. 
There were exceptions - people 
who took the opportunity of mak-
ing a scene to raid buildings and 
loot property - but these amount-
ed to less than a one-thousandth of 
the protesting population. The far 
more rc:volutionary movement was 
the one that consisted of dozens of 
causes that somehow found a com-
mon link that boWld a multirude of 
attirudes into a cohesive unit. 

There's another layer of soli-
darity that I found particularly 
moving. My best friend in 
Lawrence, Kan., was marching. So 
was an ex-boyfriend in MWlcie, 
Ind. J knew people in ew York, 
D.C. and Chicago participating in 
the largest coordinated peace 
march ever recorded. I t's easy to 
see picrures of trOOps being mobi -
li zed and think that I am scream-
ing my opinions into the political 
wind. Perhaps I didn't convince 
anyone that war was wrong as a 
result of marching. But that's what 
was so great - I didn't have to 
convince anyone, because they 
already agreed . And that kind of 
camaraderie with com plete 
stra ngers can be difficult to find 
and terribly valuable to have. 

By far the greatest comfort for 
me was the knowledge that even if 
Bush refused to listen to our pleas

I 'm very much against water. I remember the good old days when no one drank it.

LEIIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Critique of Martinez

Editor: 

I am wnong in disgust over 
Ryan Darby's article printed on 
Feb. 24 titled "Council picks 
wrong man for the job." First, I 
am shocked at the omission that 
would have put Darby'S remarks 
into context - that he and his 
conservative New Wave slate lost 
last year 's A.S . election, trounced 
by the liberal Students First slate. 
Second, ( was shocked at the fact 
that such poor writing and weak 
arguments made it past the 
Guardian edi tors. To argue that 
Ernesto's PfSsio n and letter in 
defense of himself (durin g an 
onslaught of right-wing, racial 
attacks, mind you), was a character 
naw and this would therefore hin-
der his job performance more than 
help it on a committee that Darby 
describes as hostile toward stu-
dents, is simply unbelievable. His 
passion is one of his biggest selling 
points. 

I loved how Darby described in 
detail Feller's and Garo's accom-
plishments, while slighting nearly 
every one of Erne.sto's. Darby

Students and staff suf-

Editor: 
Clerical workers, lecrurers, tech-

nicians and nurses at the University 
of California took to the street.~ 
yesterday to defend quality educa-
tion, research and health care. 
Why? 

It's not related to the tate bud-
get crisis. More than two-thirds of 
the UC budget comes from other 
sources. Grants and contracts 
increased significantly in recent 
years. The univerSIty's own figures 
show operating income is up by 
double digits. 

Employees are angry because 
the University of California is now 
widely recognized as California's 
worst public employer. Forty-nine 
Calirornla legislators have pubhcly 
demanded more accountabihty 
and less arrogance from the uni-
versity. 

The quahty of instruction, 
research and health care ar its nine 
campuses and five medIcal centers 
suffers at the hands of the un VIer 1-
ty's shortsighted management poli-
cies. The university has cho en to 
pursue low-bidder strategies that 
compronuse the quality of services 
and mock the universIty's tradi-
tions.

I cannot argue that Feller is not

both Ernesto and Lance, I know 
Ernesto is the one that would

Darby pointed out Beitollahi

in . 

I can personally speak for 
Ernesto's capability for diplomacy.

6 OPINION TIlE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Fear: Increased tension creates conflict 
continued from page 4 

\\feb sites are the ubiquitous ter-
ror alerts that tell Americans just 
how frightened they should be. 
Lately, America was elevated to 
an orange (high) terrorist alert, 
the highest since the anniversary 
of 9/ II . Is this terror alert useful 
to the average American' Are we 
equipped with any productive, 
effective way to re pond to this 
information? Would an orange 
alert on Sept. II have saved any 
lives? The answers to these que -
tions: no, no and, adly, no. So 
are color-coded terror alerts 
going to save any lives in an 
upcommg attack? Most likely not 
- but they maintain a country 
full of people who bow in awe of 
their government's perceived 
knowledge and goodwill , which 
is in the best interest of the peo-
ple who generate these alerts. 

Furthermore, any true merit 
that these terror alerts had in the 
first place is negated by their 

bogus nature. On CNN's "Late 
Edition," Homeland Security 
Secretary Tom Ridge admitted, 
"[We) realized that some of the 
information that we acted upon 
... from time to time does not 
prove to be as accurate as we 
thought it was ... one of the 
problems associated with the 
intelligence community is you 
don't always have easy access to 
the ources of information you 
are acting on." Indeed. So the 
DHS's policy is articulated as 
uch: Raise the terror level now 

and ask questions later, because 
evoking fear in the American 
public is apparently as easy as 
raising the terror alert. 

While the president and the 
media tell us to "go Qbout your 
lives normally," they want us to 
do anything but; for to live life 
normally would be to revert bade 
to the pre-Sept. II world, when 
Americans were skeptical of the 
president and were hungering for 

substantive, unbiased news. But 
people are easily controlled by 
fear, and fear is now easy to come 
by. Controlling people with fear 
i a lot easier than doing so with 
ingenuity, cleverness, leadership 
or su bstance. 

The American public has a 
right to know when it is in dan-
ger. That is a given. But when 
bogus terror alerts are spread by 
people who have a vested interest 
in keeping Americans as scared a 
possible, then the whole princi-
ple of "knowledge is power" is 
defeated. With the admittance 
that the orange terror alert was 
bogus, all future terror alerts are 
delegitimized. Terrorists aren't 
stupid - they also read the news 
and realize that the American 
government is doing their work 
for them by keeping the 
American public in a constant 
state of fear. So fight terrorism, 
fight fear, and quit hoarding the 
gas masks and duct tape. 

Protest: Peaceful protestors prevail 
con lin ued {rom page 5 

for peace, other people in other 
countries were. As long as there 
are people in Europe, Asia, 
South America and most defi-
nitely in the Middle East who see 
that not everyone supports this 
military endeavor, then protest-
ing proved its worth. 

I will not contribute to a 
naoon bemg torn apart by con-
fllcong ideals. If war comes, then 
I WIll support my country and 
those soldier, WIlling to die for 
the pre ervation of freedom, 
even as I believe that there were 
ways to aVOId such a conflict and 
other motives to invade beyond 

democracy and liberty. But until 
that point, I will protest and 
argue and debate and do my 
damnedest to show that there are 
people who do not recognize this 
as the best course of action. 

I don't think petitioning the 
government for a redres of 
grievances has ever meant as 
much to me as it did last week.. It 
was more than meeting people 
who believed what I believed, 
and 11 was more than sending :i 
message to my peers and politi-
cians. It was a statement to peo-
ple I had never met m countries 
far away. It was standing with 
hundreds of thousands of others 

in the grea test peace protest ever 
saying, "This is what I believe." 

Even though this demon tra-
tion stemmed from a fear of war, 
it was a manifestation of wanting 
peace. And the fact that so many 
people for so many reasons want-
ed to support peace is a hearten-
ing thought. Perhap peace will 
not come until after this war has 
been fought, but at least [ can say 
that I voiced my objection even 
before that war began. At least 
people WIll know that this was not 
a war that everyone wanted. And 
at least people will know - both 
here and abroad - that they are 
not alone in what they believe. 

Stop: 
Bottled water 

could ruin 
your life 
continued from page 5 

My best friend used to be like me. 
He used to know where every Mr. 
Pibb soda dispenser was in town. 
And then, one day, out of the blue, 
he decided to stop drinking soda. He 
just quit, cold turkey. r quicJdy saw it 
was the beginning of the end, Next 
week hes wearing Birkenstocks with 
socks and telling me about how 
Hostess factories have rats 1n them. I 
mean, what the hell. Everybody 
knows Hostess factories have rats in 
them, but you just don't think about 
it and you sure as hell don't talIc 
about it. It's ~ke deatfi; it's in the back 
of your mind, but there's a good rea-
son you don't bring it to the front, 
because then you start doing silly 
things like going to church, buying 
annoying bumper stickers, and ask-
ing people at Ralph's what they're 
doing this weekend and if they want 
to attend a barbeque you and a cou-
ple friends are having. 

But it's a shame - when we 
were growing up we lived off Super 
Nintendo and Coke, and wI: were 
damn cool. Now only I am damn 
cool; my best friend is just this guy 
that makes tea in his car and would 
smoke clove cigarettes if they 
weren't so bad for hi m. 130ttled 
water ruined his life; it could ruin 
yours. Look for warning signs like 
50 percent of your fridge not con-
sisting of cans and having surpris-
ingly low restaurant bills. You 
could be becoming lame.

Like many of the unions rallying 
yesterday, C.U.E. has been negotiat-
ing a new contract for over two 
years, attempting to gain higher 
wages, raises and areas for advance-
ment. 

However, C.U.E. has not found 
the University of California cooper-

"We've found the administration

The Univer ity of California 
feels that it has negotiated and deliv-

benefits and retirement plans as

"UC continues to do what it caf'

dedication and service, and to help

In opposlOon to Itfung '\pendmg

"The Supreme Court makes deci-

ome, mcludlng Brown, also 
argued that a lawswt agalll!>t the

for AssOCIated Srudenrs because the 
UCSD admmistration might agree

AsSOCiated Students I an internal

not ,ub,ect to the Supreme Court's 
mterpretauon of the Fir t 
Amendment. 

DespIte the deciSIOn, Leventhal 
was able to raise his funds through 
donations from the student-formed 
Committee to ElectJoe Leventhal, 
and went on to win the presidcnoal 
election. 

In its meeting on Feb. 26, the 
A .. Council split the proposed 
amendments into two separate 
Items. The first, which included 
the stratified spending limits, was 
approved 12 -7- 1, while the sec-
ond, which held that a caodldate's 

decl~ion be prulled on the ballot, 
was approved 14-4-0. 

Pedro Slated that the reporting of 
postcard collection figures was 
"pretty much on the honor system." 

he also said that if a school won the 
contest by reporting a false number 
of postcards, it would not make a big 
difference to the org:uuzaoon. 

"I would have to talk to them 
about [reporting a fal e numherJ," 
Pedro said. "It wouldn't be sOllle-
thll1g that would be punitive many 
way. The contest was pretty much a 
motivational thing to get peoplc to 
collect postcards hefore the confer-
ence. There wouldn't be a pUnish-
ment or anything." 

U SD delegates will be viSiting 
classrooms and tabling on Library 
Walk next week to collect more 
SIgned postcards, Brown said. 

Expenses for the tTl p, which 
include airfare and lodging accom-
modations, as well as the confer-
ence registrauon fees for nine dele-
gates, will bc Incurred by the A.S. 
general fund .

ference, which will be held from 
March 7 to March II, were asked

omething Corporate may not have 
been the first to bridge the gap between 
the time-honored worlds of Emo and Pop-
Punk - credit Vleel-er with that - but 
they may be the fir t band of their ilk to 
claim Elton John a a primary influence 
and bang out melr runes of teenage angst 
on a plano.

Juhana Theory tonight for A.S. 
Programmlllg's pre- \VinterFest show at

Com billing na ally vocal whines with 
crunchy three-chord hooks, the five-piece 
emerged from the fertile Orange County 
pop-punk scene in 2001 with the Drive-

"Audioboxer." Featured on the EP was a 
self-proclaimed "bitter anthem" titled (i n 
the parlance of a 12-year-old instant mes-
senger) "iF yoU C Jordan," which in no 
ome won Something Corporate radio rota-

Steel Train

Senior Staff Writer 

teel Train, label mates of Something 
orporate on Drive Thru Records, wi ll 

open up the A.S. TGIF event Feb. 27 at 
RIMAC. While those familiar with Drive 
Thru Records will be anxious to notch 
Steel Train as another emo-punk hybrid, 
samples from their new EP, "For You My 
Dear," indicate that there is something 
sublimely different about what Steel Train 
has to offer. 

This band is in its infancy in a number 
of ways. First, mey ju t put out their first 
release at the end of January - a six song 
EP (they have yet to release a full-length 
album on a major label). econd, their 
sound, whi le consisting of acoustic g1litar 
and occa ional plano, still sounds ome-
what undeveloped . 

On a few tracks, they break into what 
sounds like an acoustic jam band with a 
white freestyle rapper. The majority of 
their tracks, however, break down to what 
one would be tempted to ca ll straightfor-
ward emo with a twinge of optimism. 
Their full acoustic guitar sounds are 
accompanied by a nch and sweet-sounding 
voice, heavy on the treblc in true emo form 
but lacking tile anger/deprcsslon that hides 
behind most of that genre's mUSIc.

Theory: Going indie was important 
continued from page 10 

of" mooth Criminal," as well as some cle-
ments taken from hair bands of the '80s, then 
you can somewhat pinpoint the layered SOlU1d 
of thi~ song. 

The rest of "Love" unfolds in much thc 
samc way. Throughout the album, it~ sound 
oscillates between heavy, intense b'1litars in 
songs like "Bring it Low," to rhe purely 
acoustic g\lita r~ of "Whi te Days" and "As It 

Stand~," to the piano-mfused and almost bal -
lad-hkc "Shell of a Man," which a serts, "Why 
can't I let go, I'm only the shell of a man. I'm 
lost in myself and afraid of who I really am ." 
Their song "Repeating, Repeating," sounds 
exactly like a synthesis of 1etallica and 
l loobastank. 

The Juliana Theory consists of lead singer 
and guitarist Brett Detar, bassist Chad Alan, 
guitarist Joshua Fiedler, guitarist Joshua 
Kosker and drummer Neil I Iebrank. The 
quintet formed in 1997 in Southwester, Penn. 
Originally, TheJuliana Theory was a Side pro-
ject for the band members who at the Dme 
were playing \Vlth odlcr groups. Ilowcvcr, as 
the bandmares were experimenting with 
sowlds, they started to appreciate the sounds 
they were creating. 

After the band fell into place, it went on a 
tour, during which it signed with the inde-
pendent labellboth & ail. I t released three 
CDs with the label : meir debut "Understand 
this is a Dream" in 1999 (which has a more 
punk-rock sound), "Emotion i Dead" in 
2000 (which denotes a change in sound with 
an addition of a t11ird guitar and more per-
onal lyrics), and the EP "Music from 

Anomer Room" in 2001 (which sounds like it 
was heavily influenced by classical rock). The 
following year they signed wim meir current 
label, Epic Records. 

"G{)ing the indie route was very important 
to us," Detar said. "There were drawbacks, like 
rusmbution and radiO play, but it afforded US 
the ability to take the time to learn how to 

make records, build a loyal fan base and 
become a really strong live band." 

They certainly seem to have gained a loyal 
fan gathering, considering that without any 
outside di triblltion, their fir~t two indepen-
dent releases sold a total of 130,000 copies. 
The hand has also kept a relentless tour 
schedille throughout the la ~t couple of year~, 
playing wherever they have been ahle to find 
an audience. These shows con~lsted of a gig 
in a f,l/l'~ living room and various small club 
venues. As the band gained a followlllg, the 
concert facilities at wlllch they were perform-
ing grew in izc. On their current U.S. tour, 
they se ll out I ,OOO-seat venues, and some of 
the people in attendance probably include the 
initial su pporters the group met on the road. 

The band eems to approach touring, 
releasing re ords and generating new, original 
sounds with a strong mentality. While a com-
plete change of sound can often alienate an 
audience, TIle Juliana Theory seems to have 
found a method to alter its music on each new 
release, while keeping its loyal fans and gaining 
new ones. They have listed bands like Lcd 
Zeppelin, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins, 
all of whom are known for reinventing their 
music, as influences. These ir.spirations most 
likely helped TheJuliana Theory find a perfect 
balance of artistic growth mat allows them to 
keep their albums soWlding fresh without los-
ing me origlllal, dynamic force mat drives the 
band. 

According to Detar, the reinvention of 
their sound is extremely important, especial-
ly during moments when they get to interact 
with me audience. He said, "We want our 
audience to grow with us. We work so hard 
on our tours. Live, we bring a heaviness and 
energy to our music that most people who 
have only listened to our records might not 
expq:t." 

You can experience this stream of live ener-
gy come to life Feb. 27. Come ee TheJuliana 
Theory in concert at RIMAC at 7 p.m.

Queens: They rule rock and trip hop 
continued from page 9 

going, Oliveri and IlolOme main-
tain a dizzying array of other pro-
jects and formal connections. Both 
were previously in Kyus , and they 
have a policy of doing other things 
to make coming back to Queens Of 
The Stone Age enjoyable. 

Homme is working on hi 
De sert Sessions, for which he 
brings along Oliveri, but i al 0 
working on a track for trip-hop 
group U. .C.L.E. liveri ha an 
off-again, on-again place In the punk 
band The Dwarves, in which he calls 
himself Rex Everything (there is no 
accounting for rockers who give 
themselves names). Also, livcri is 
working with another former Kyuss 
drummer Bram Bjork (who now 
heads another stoner/ o-cal urf rock 
band, Fu .\ lanchu) and Iionune on 
.\ londo Generator, for which Olivcri 
wants to put out a secund album. 

'To fully grasp how much band

.lust try not to get lost in the quag-
nure that comes out of Kruss: It 's 
murky and fluw on to more group 
then one nught expect. 

Fret not, though, these projects 
are nor SIgnS of Q ueens of the 

tone Age spltttlng or lOSing mler-
e t, they jusl make the reum ons 
\\eeter. Queens Of The tone Age 

has been 0 11 an extensive lOuring 
chedule, and several of those date 

include some big-name festiva ls, 
including Coachella Va lley Music 
and Arts Festival and the restart of 
the late-era Grunge tradition, 
Lollapalooza 2003, which lists San 
Diego as a stop. 

With "Songs For The Deaf," 
Queens of the Stone Age's third 
release, they have been finding 
increased radio play and critical 
success. The fir t single, "No One 

" Some have been critical 
of 'Songs For The Deaf 
in its production saying 
it's too similar, too one, 

sided .. ," 

Know," has been on Billboard's 
Modern Rock hart for 21 \\ ceks 
and is resting at the o. I position. 
Queens of the tone Age also 
received a Grammv nomination for 
Best I lard Rock Performance, bur 
lost om to Grohl and (he orher 1'00 
Fighters for theIr smgle, "All 1y 
Life" (but when you're involved 
with two of the five groups nomi-
nated, you can 't really go wrong). 

Queens of the lOne ge is set to 
release a ccond Single, "Go \\lith 
The Flow," and there will be a VIdeo 
to accompany the track, which will 
be partially animated and involve 

playing chicken with a cow and see-
ing members of the band die, again . 

Some have been critical of 
" ongs For The Dear' in its pro-
duction, sayi.ng it's tuo similar, too 
one-sided and hits the car withoul 
much change. Admittedly, the 
sound isn't as dynamic as some 
groups, but then again, Queens of 
the Stone Age isn't the classical all-
around rock band. They are 
focused on one ide - a crunchier, 
harder version of rock, sans-ballads 
and acou tic-derived folk of, say, 
early U2 . In all fairness, many of 
the rock crities who say this are try-
ing to place thei r desires for a dif-
ferent scene 011 a band that is doing 
something on its own. 

Ironically, even those who attack 
the album, often wary of U1C hype It 
received early on (belllg touted as 
"the econd coming of rock" or "the 
rcmrn of rock," w halever clther of 
those statemcnt~ " suppu~cd to 
mean), soli ha"e to .ldnlll how good 
"Songs For The Dear' i~, de~plte 
their grtevances. It I~ a b'Teat alhum, 
though it docs have it~ ~elback~:

songs that WIll bug the hell out of 
you after a few It ,tens. They arc 
intended to mililic U1C u,clcss banter 
that radiO OJ' till the air \\ ith, but 
that is exactly why most people hate 
radio OJ . 

\Vith a CJreer path that IS any-
thing bUl straight ahead and a 
sound that stands up and demand 
attention, Queens of the tone Age 
is doing (hings its own way and 
reaping the rewards. 

Lactose: No topic is too 
taboo for brave Del 

IOn Top': 
Just another 

driven, y ung

CDnllnucJ from {l<lgf 9 
rhymes with I t)l} 1 \ " 1 \\'I~h \ \}' 
Brother Georgc \\ 'as Ilere" and 
1993 's " '0 Need for Alarm." 
Though steadily becoming more 
popular, Del never quite broke 
through and was subsequen tl y 
dropped from Elektra Records 
just a his third solo album wa, 
about to be rel eased. 

Rather than packIng !lin, Del 
went on to help form a cene of 
Independent rappers based In 
Oakland and recorded an album 
WIth h,s own crew, the 
Hi eroglyphic, titled "3 rd Eye 
Vision" (1998). The grou P 
toured Intensely and gained a 
cult-like follOWing. Soon, It was 
wne for Del to change gea rs 
again, and he released the mOH-
Iy self-produced "Both SIdes of 
the Brain" In 2000, featunng 
more of Del's sIgnature ~Iang 
and guest appearances by hlp-
hop luminarte Itkc EI·P and 

ompany Flow. The album gar-
nered more crtttcal attention 
from the likes of Roiling tone, 
whtch referred to Del as "rap's 
staunchly Independenl lord of 
the underground ." 

ever one to remain inactive 
or predictable, Del's next move 
wa to form the "hlp-hop super-
group" Deltrun 3030. The 
group, whIch tncluded produce r 

Dan "the AutomJtor" akamura 
and turntabhst Kid Ko.ll a, 
relcJscd IlS ;c1f-titled debut In 
2000, al 0 to mass crittcal pra ise. 
The collaboration with 
Nakamura helped to sc t up 
Gorillaz, the most successful 
prOject Del has worked on to 
date. The fictional cartoon band, 
which al 0 Including Blur's 
Damon Albarn and numerous 
olher guests, ~corcd a worldWIde 
hit with the single " !tnt 
Ea twood" and its accompany-
ing deranged cartoon VIdeo. A 
large part of the ~ong's ~uccess 
can be attributed to Del, who'~ 
innovative and htlarious rhymes 
teal the show. Much like Del 's 

other matenal, the song al,o had 
a large cros over appeal, plcas-
mg both rock and hip-hop fans . 

Del tha Funky llomosapien 
stands as an inventive artist who 
has achIeved much In h,s career 
but sti li exudes limitless potential. 
Now that Del finally has had a 
taste of the commerctal ucc~s 
his Impressive credentials suggest 
he deserves, he is poised lO go ... 
well, who knows where, bUl it wtll 
likely be somewhere worth check-
ing out. In the meantime, you ca n 
Jt least capture where Del now, 
by getting out to WinterFcst 
early, and enJoy,ng everythIng 
there IS to offer.

cominlled from page 9 
"The Next Step" LP also caught 
the attention of San Franci co-
ba,ed Om Records, a well -respect-
ed underg-round music label that 
llulCkly offered the duo a rccord-
ing COlllract after hearing the 
albulIl. The duo then released Its 

~econd album, "Question In thc 
Form of an Answer." It captured 
the People Under The Stall" III 
clamc form : funky jazz loops, 
cmp scratching and a refreshingly 
light-hearted aw rudc toward hip-
hop. 

The duo is now prOllloting It, 
new album,"O T (Origtnal Sound 
Track) ." The theory behind the 
new album is to shorten the dis-
tance between the artist and the 
person listening. Approaching the 

production for "OST" with open 
minds, Thes One and Doublc K 
have included more Illlmcal cle-
ments than the "Question 10 the 
Form of an An wer" day\. The 
InOucncc of reggae and dance

If anythlllg, People nder the

performance at WlllterFesr. It

Normal: These musicians love comedians 
continued from page 9 

What in the audience can 
reaUy get your attention? 

I /ov~ to watch people 111 the 
aud,ence. There arc two things I 
watch: ~omeone have a really good 
time dancing, totally enJoYJng 
thelll,elves; and that one a\shole in 
the crowd who can go Just a little 
roo far. 

'Olat !>ounds ominous. What 
happens when he does go a little 
tOO far? 

Anythlllg could happen. Tn ~ew 
Orleans, we had ,I guy that was 
totally bringing everyone down 
around him, so we all just Jumped 
off the stage and trxlk him OUl of 
there. Usually our stage crew, 
which is just a bunch of our frtends, 
helps us out WIth those. 

You've been rather popular in 
Europe, debuting high on their 
music charts and playing the 
biggest fe tivals. Why do you 
think that you were so strongly 
embraced there? 

Especially the UK, people get 
more excited about music. UK peo-
ple think Americans are jaded, and 
when they ee that an Amencan 
band is coming through their town, 
they want to go check them Out JUSt 
for the musIc. 

Here, radio here pretty much 
sucks, and you don 't hear any good 
bands. j\ITV IS a Joke, and publica-
tions like Rolling Stone and Spin 
are alway behind - by the ome 
tIley write about something, it's 
come and gone. The UK mu ic 
magaZlnes are weekly and search-
109 for "the new thing," which 
makes them work harder and get 
better coverage. 

What's your opinion of the 
San Diego scene? 

It comes and It goes. My 
favorite club by far to play IS The 
Casbah. Smff doesn't happen often,

Hands-on: The sweet humble gufS from Rocket From The Crypt tdke an 
active role In order to ensure that their fans enJOY thler performances 

so you can't JUSt slack off and catch 
something great the next tltnc. 

San Diego tS just a Iny town, 
really. It's laId back and mellow, and 
that's what IS beautlful about it. 
People necd to go outside more. 
We don't freeze if we go out at 
night, so get out of the house and 
off the TV! 

RITe was on Inter cope 
records un ti l 2000. Is indie 
Vagrant Records more fitting? 

That's acrually a very tough call. 
I nterscope was a good place for us 
when we SIgned, but it changed 
very qwckly. When we SIgned, 
there were 20 or so bands - noth-
ing like the hundred~ it has now 
aftcr it merged WIth other labels. 
\Ve went from a ~mall band (10 a 
small totem pole to a small band 
waiting to get on that totem pole. 
Though [nterscope never forced us 
IntO anythmg, they had a hard orne 
keeping their promt;e about our 
releases; we were proflllsed our 
music would be treated 10 a certain 
way. 

Rocket was dO indle band that 
made theIr label look good hec3llSc 
we were a band that had worked 
our asses off to get to that pomt. 
Eventually, the label got too bllSY. 
[Laughs] I guess we lust make 
things happen for other people 
because the same thlOg ~ecms to be 
happemng at Vagrant. 

Isn 't that discouraging? 
lt IS, but pupularlty IS a wei rd 

thing. You want It and you don't. 
I love what we do, but you do 
want to ~ee your musIc grow. 
\Vhat's popular is ju,t tOO unpre-
dlclable; bands that 10 my opin-
ion suck get huge . The sta te of 

mU~IC goes back and forth. [ 
would have never predIcted that 
bands like The Illves and T he 
\Vhlte Stripes, which I thlOk IS 
the greatest wave of mU~lc to 
come along, would hal'e been 
popular.

L-______________________________________________ RES TAU RAN 1 

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 15 

'Joe Millionaire' is a massive disappointment 'Nuevo California' boldly 
crosses borders don't pop 

my sheep 
Evan Mclaughlin 

I 'm not a big fan of reality TV While I've had glimpses into the godforsaken domain of real-
ity TV; r have never fully embraced 
it for wha tit was past the occasion-

a� episode of "Cheaters" or "Real 
World." Generally, I don't care 
whether or not someone can eat 15 
spiders in one minute or what the 
hell Ouy is trying to mutter to his 
punk kids. 

That is, of course, untill caught 
wind of Fox's most recent scheme: 
'Joe Millionaire." Twenty women 
would be wooed at a French 
chateau by a tall, dark and hand-
some man worth 550 million who 
has cal led upon the Fox Network to 
set him up with true love on nation-
al television. Except, once the 19 
other golddiggers are eliminated, 
Joe Millionaire reveals that he\; 
really just J oe Dirt, and the maiden 
of choice is forced to choose 
whether or not she wants to pursue 
a relationship with a construction 
worker who earns 519,000 annual-
ly. Wow. 

Upon first hearing the Story's 
concept, I immediately pictured 
those department store commer-
cials where the women re charg-
ing and clawing their way to the 
clearance racks as soon as the 
store's doors open for the one-day 
sale. Except this sale was 50 mil-
lion times bigger and, oh yeah, the 
network's even throwing a free 
guy in to the mix to sweeten the 
deal. 

The idea was brilliant. The 
how's producers, however, com-

pletely lost out on the show's 
potential for grea01css. 

The potential I write of revolves 
primarily around one central 
theme: The average woman, if pro-
voled with a proper lure like inor-
dinate amounts of money and fame, 
will transfoml into a most conniv-
ing and shrewd individual, stopping 
at nothing short of murder to get 

her hands on the man, the money 
and the most coveted of all goods 
- the spotlight. 

Now of course, an argument 
can be made that I'm being way too 
misogynistic about female charac-
ter, and that not all women are 
money-grubbing whores and what-
not. Fine, but can't the casting 
directors find at least 20 attractive 
women of the aforementioned 
leanings toward money and fame? 
I've been to the Gaslamp - I know 
they're out there, by George! It 
can't be too hard to find 20 ladies 
like th.is. 

The show should, theoretically, 
write itself, seeing as how it's reality 
TV and all . The series will follow a 
simple formula where the women 
catfight every episode, talk shit to 
each other and backstab at every 
opportunity. Finally, one will be left 
standing with Joe, and she will be 
charged with the task of deciding 
whether or not to ditch him 
because he's got no money or to 
stay with him because she has found 
love. She leaves the dude once she . 
finds out hes not wonh millions 
and the exploitation of the gold-
digging ice Queen is wrapped up. 

Instead, what has transpired 
over the last several weeks was an 
interpretation entirely too dull of 
its prospects. The producers of "Joe 
Millionaire" cho e to drive the 
shows action like a fairy tale. They 
took the concept mtirtly too seri-
ously. Why have the twist at the 
end that our millionaire isn't worth 
more than a Ford Pinto if theres no 
intention that the only thing the 
women are after is money? If the 
women were really into it for Evan 
Marriot's intrinsic Qualities, why 
even bother with the lie about the 
million dollars? 

Another Question I have is why 
Evan didn't take advantage of his 
situation to the fullest. I lere's a guy 
who has 20 gorgeous women con-
vinced that he\; a millionaIre - and 
he's looking for love? Maybe I'm 
nuts, but I don't know why the pro-
ducers wouldn't have encouraged 
him to just take advantage of the 
situation. Lead the girls on. Evoke 
some one-night stand drama for all 
to see. This is Fox, damn it - we 
want a freak show! 

Want more hiatus? 

Instead, the lame fairy tale nar-
rative has an equally lame result. 
Did Spielberg write these episodes? 
Seriously, this was corny. We didn't 
even get a really dramatic response. 
Zora, the winner of the "Who 
wants to many a ditch-digger?" 
sweepstakes saved face and agreed 
to continue a relationship with 
Evan, even though he didn't have 
the promised 550 mil.lion. I"was a 
safe play and no one was re~ sur-
prised, considering she seemed the 
most down to caM of the 20 any-
way. The "surprise twist that even 
Evan doesn't know about" was that 
the two were given a real S I million 
to split because love conquered 
greed when Zora decided to stay. 
Hold the applause. 

What should have happened is 
that either Evan chooses the most 
scathing, most manipulative 
woman available, forcing her to 
choose (in which case she probably 
would have dismissed Evan 'the 
Excavator); or, after the finalist 
chooses to stay without the money, 
Paul the pompous butler offeres 
her 51 million to walk away from 
Evan. 

That is a real "love versus 
money" choice. Choosing to stay 
with a guy while the cameras are 
rolling even though he has no 
money is easy. If she really were 
committed to making something 
work with Evan, she should have 
been forced to tum down the sum 
to stay with him. 

While a 5t million offered to 
ditch the ditch-digger is a bit 
extreme, a twist along those lines 
would have kept the audience inter-
ested. "J oe Millionaire" was laclcing 
"Real World" drama simply 
because the casters couldn't pro-
duce more scatterbrained Heidis, 
snobby A1isons or sluny Sarahs. 
The contestants were, overall, not 
rude or manipulative enough to 
tncite the catfights the audience was 
looking for. The writers didn't cre-
ate the uncomfortable situations 
required for such a captivating 
how, neither. 

I don't know about this rea.lity 
TV thing - I think I've had 
enough. Ah, who am I kidding? I'll 
see you at the "Married by 
America" debut next week. 

San Diego Repertory Theatre's new play 
crosses border to create a multilayered world 

ByHANAHSU 
Staff~er 

The San Diego Repertory 
Theater bills its new work as a "bina-
tional play" and an "international 
mystery." Co-playwright Bernard 
Solano calls his piece "2Ist-century 
noir with a very spi.ritual palette," 
and co-playwright Allan Havis likens 
it to a Robert Altman scripL One 
thing is for sure: "Nuevo California" 
is a powerful, visionary gem of a 
drama. 

In both form and content, 
"Nuevo California" is unique. 
Director Sam Woodhouse, Solano 
and their team interviewed hundreds 
of people from every walk of life in 
San Diego, TIjuana and Mexicali 
about their feelings on the border 
fence. Playwright and UCSD pro-
fessor Havis joined, a multiethnic 
cast coalesced, and six years of devel-
opment later, the result was "Nuevo 
California." 

The play's bold premise: What 
would happen if a huge earthquake 
wiped LA off the map, prompting 
the United States and Mexico to 
rebuild San Diego and TIjuana as 
one state? From there, the play 
transports us to 2080 A.D., at the 
moment where Pope Felipe, the 
first Mexican-American pope, is to 
give his blessing to tear down the 
border fence to create uevo 
California. Multiethnic supporters 
and opponents have gathered to 
witness the historic moment when 
disaster strikes. Will Nuevo 
California survive? 

Theater 
REVIEW 

"harsh mirror." Ultimately, the play 
turns painful truths into opportuni-
ties for catharsis and transformation. 

The music, set and stage all con-
tribute to a well-crafted play. The 
electronic bursts of TIjuana's Nortec 
Collective induce chills in suspense-
ful scenes. The simple set of metal 
and sand become powerful symbols. 
Finally, the small theatre makes for 
an intimate setting, enhancing the 
emotional intensity of the perfor-
mances. 

John Campion, as Pope Felipe, 
excels in his Scrooge-like transfor-
mation from a jocose, materialistic 
pope (who initially prefers singing 
for MTV to spealcing The Word) to 
a vulnerable man who, in helping 
border victim ghosts in their unfin-
ished business, can finally achieve 
peace and confer it to others. 

Jennifer Chu is remarkable as the 
rhyming, Spanglish-spouting Sin 
Fin, a syncretic figure whose name 
means "without end" in Spanish. 
Initially appearing to be a scrappy 
wannabe, Sin Fin emerges as the wise 
fool. She sees the truth, gets the last 
word in a powerful closing mono-
logue, and dares to lid [0 create a new 
beginning. In many ways, rlus sooth-
sayer who hopes for a new furure 
without end is the penultimate per-
sonification of the plays spirit. 

"Nuevo California" will trike a 
nerve, and the creators know It. 

Sometimes, a play comes along 
that taps into the pulse of a region 
and calls for a new vision. I n this 
post 9/11 era of paranoia, " uevo 
California" is especially omely in 
its plea for tolerance and change 
nght III our own backyard. " uevo 
California" is not only relevant to 
our place and time, but promises to 
be universal and timeless.

Check out these Web-exclusive stories online at www.ucsdguordian.org : 

But just as this play defies easy 
categori7.3tion, it also avoids easy 
answers. Native-American myths, 
Mexican burial rites and Catholic 
beliefs share center stage. The mul -
tiethnic cast skillfully portrays a 
host of characters: There is the iso-
lationist American woman, the 
proud-to-be-Mexican family man 
and U.S. business owner, the 
African-American hotshot news 
reporter, the disillusioned J ewish-
American photographer, the ultra-
nationalist and Catholic single 
mother from TIjuana, the Mexican-
American pope who reeks on more 
than one level, and a Spanglish-
speaking Asian girl named Sin Fin.

THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 27. 2003 TilE UCSD GUARDIAN PORTS 19 

Baseball: Jeff Riddle recovers strongly from batting slump Golf: Scheer 
leads Tritons 
with a score 

continued from page 20 
four runs scored and 13 RB[s while 
committing just a single error in 31 
defensive chances - a fie lding per-
centage of .968 - for the week. 

" ['ve been playing some first 
base this year so that we can get 
some flexibility in the lineup," 
Riddle said. "We have so much 
potential on the bench, and by 
moving people around defensively, 
we can get ome other bats and 
some of our younger guy in the 
lineup." 

Riddle began the week going 4-
for-6, with a home run and five 
RB[s in a 19-6 non-conference rout 
of Azusa Pacific. During 
Bergstrom's stellar performance in 
game two against C USB, Riddle 
wCnt 2-for-3 with a horne run and 

four RBIs . [n game four, scheduled 
for seven innings, Riddl e went 2-
for-4 wim an RB[ and a run in a 5-
3 win in II innings. 

As a 2002 First Team All-CCAA 
selection, Riddle had at least one hit 
and onc RB r in each of five games 
played this week, striking out only 
once and improving his batting 
average for the season to .2 74. 

"The most impressi ve thing 
about Jeff is that he was struggling 
a few weeks ago, but you wouldn't 
know it by watching him play," 
O'Brien said. "[ Ie handled the 
adversity well, and bec3u e he did-
n't get 100 low or too down, things 
turned around for him quickly. 

ow that he is hitting the cover off 
the ball, you can't tell that he is 
playing that well. He is not too hot, 

but rather has been very consistent 
in how he goes abol)[ things, and r 
think mat's a big reason why he has 
been so successful." 

Riddle leads me team with mree 
home runs, 23 RB[s, and is tied 
with Smith, shortstop Keith 
Hernandez and outfielder Brett 
Burton in doubles; each has four. 

"Recently we've been getting a 
lot of guys on base," Riddle aid . 
"Pitchers are worrying abOUl our 
base runners stealing bases, so I am 
getting some good pitches to hit." 

UCSD now sits alone atop me 
CCAA wim a conference record of 
7 - \. Becallse of their recent suc-
cesses on the field, the Tritons 
entered the Collegiate Baseball 

ewspaper NCAA Division II Poll 
this week at No. 14. 

"We have been able to get it done 
these past few games because we are 
swinging me bats well and putting 
the ball in play," Bergstrom said. 

Riddle agrees. 
"We are playing well right now 

because everyone is doing his part," 
Riddle said . "Every game, a new 
guy steps up. That' why thiS is a 
team game; if I don 't get it done, f 
know that the other guys in the 
lineup will. We are a very solid 
team with phenomenal athletes." 

UCSD faces C U Los Angeles 
in a four-game series this weekend. 
The Tritons playa doubleheader 
on Feb. 27 in Lo Angeles at 4 p.m. 
On March I, UCSD returns to 
Triton Baseball Stadium to finish

et from UCSD. Travis Bertolll 
of Cal Poly shot a course record 
of an II -under-par 205 to give 
him me top individual spot in 
me invitational. 

"We had played this course 
before, but they added nine 
holes this time that we had 
never played, and we had a bi t 
of wetness as well on Tuesday," 
Wydra aid, explaining some of 
the difficuilles me team faced 
during the tournament. 

Water polo: UCSD misses offense in game against Davis 
fndividually, U SD junior 

Alan cheer had the low score 
for me team with a I-over-par 
217 . Scheer shot scores of 74, 
70 and 73 III his three rounds, 
which put hun III a tic for 13 m 
place with Andy Barnllm of 
ChiCO tate. cheer's 70 111 the 
second round was only one 
abovc me leadll1g score for the 
day, a 69. 

contmued [rom page 20 
Tucker and Miranda Paulson 

were d,e top scorers of the match 
with three goals apiece. Maris 
Bantilan-Smith and E lizabeth 
Keesey also added two gals each. 

[n ils next game, UC D faced 
off against Australia University 
Spon, a club team composed of 
athletes from various Australian 
colleges. The Aussies proved to bc 
a more formidable foe than UCSC, 
but the Tritons conti nued to domi-
nate, taking a 5-1 advantage at half-
time and fini shing wim a 9-5 victo-
ry that propelled UCSD to the 
semifinals . Once again, Paulwn 
a nd Tucker were the top scorers, 
with three and twO goals, re;pec-
tively. The win did not officially go 

on UCSD' record, however, 
because AU in not a alional 
Collegiate Athletic Association-
sanctioned four-year school. 

In the semifinals against Davis, 
UCSD's defense showed up to 
play, but unfortunately, the Triton 
offen e couldn't find its goal-scor-
ing form and fell to the ggies in 
a low-sco ring conte t 3-\. 
Paulson was the lone goal-scorer 
for UCSD. The Tmons kcpt 
things close for 1Il0St of the game 
and entered the half with the 
game tied at one apiece, but they 
failed to convert on man-ups and 
brcakaways and couldn't come up 
with an)' goa ls to match the two 
that Davi put lip in the third 
quaner. 

"Our defense worked; we had 
great communication, but our 
offense didn't now like it normally 
does," Boyle sa id. 

Later thaI day, UC D found 
itself in a hootout for mird place 
against Hartwick, but me tran i-
tion to a press defense proved to 
be the decisive factor when the 
TritOns held the Hawks to one 
goal in the second half en route to 
a 9-8 victory. The game wasn't 
decided until me final minute, 
when Keesey cored to break an -

tie . The potent UCSD offense 
made its triumphant return when 
Tucker, Paulson and Keesey each 
scored two goa ls in the contest. 
The Tritons also went 9-for-28 on 
shots, a definite Improvement 

from the dismal l -for- 14 against 
Davis. 

"Once we put me clamps on 
[Hartwick]; we were able to shut 
them down and take over the 
peri meter," Sanders said. 

Despite the strong finish, 
Sanders insists mat changes must 
be made if UCSD is to play well 
when the Tritons square off against 
Claremont College and cross-town 
rival DSU on March [ . 

"We're looking forward to 
playing [San Diego] State; it's a 
big rivalry, and I think we 're 
going to give them a run for their 
money ... but we need to corne 
out and take control of the game; 
we can't be plaYlllg catch-up any-
more," he said. 

The next two Tritons were 
freshmen Robbie Kramer and 
Ryo Yamada, who bom filll hed 
in a tie for 34th place wah a 
score of 230. Krammer shot a 
74 in hiS first round, but fol-
lowed mat up with two 78s, 
while Yamada started With a 76 
and finished with two 77s. 

COining in fourth for 
UCSD was senior Blake 

Track: Tritons prepare for tough Division I competition 

chneider, whose 233 put rum 
at 17 over par and I n 40th place 
for me tournament. Schneider 
shot 7 , 77 and 7 dUring hiS 
three rounds. The Tnron ' final

"The women knew mey would

The men's team was also very 
successful with a lew of record-
