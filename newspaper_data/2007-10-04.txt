In an attempt to attract more 
prominent speakers for undergradu-
ate graduation ceremonies, the A.S. 
Council recently announced the 
reintroduction of a campuswide bac-
calaureate — known as the Senior 
Celebration — to supplement the six 
individual college graduations. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
has charged the Senior Celebration 
Planning Committee, co-chaired 
by Biological Sciences Senator 
Emma Sandoe and Associate 
Vice Chancellor of University 

Communications Stacie A. Spector, 
to oversee preparations for the cel-
ebration.

The proposal for an all-cam-
pus graduation was prompted by 
last year’s Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction report, 
which emphasized student desire 
for more campuswide traditions 
to improve the university’s overall 
atmosphere.

“We realized that students wanted 
the opportunity for all colleges to 
come together and celebrate,” Sandoe 
said. “A lot of people thought it was a 
good idea and the administration has 
been very cooperative.”

Inadequate funding has consis-
tently been an issue with graduation 
ceremonies. According to former 
Eleanor Roosevelt College Senior 
Senator Erik Rodriguez-Palacios, 
who helped lead the push for a uni-
fied baccalaureate last year, funding 
has not increased in several years 
though student fees have continued 

to rise.
Support for the campuswide cel-

ebration, however, has proven rela-
tively high. The planning committee 
has received $25,000 each from the 
A.S. Council, the chancellor’s office, 
and the vice chancellor of external 
relations’ office. The group is also 
anticipating further contributions 
from the vice chancellor of student 
affairs’ office.

The all-campus event will not 
replace individual college gradua-
tions, but aims to give graduating 
students the opportunity to celebrate 
together, regardless of their college.

“I think that graduations last 
quarter were appropriate for the level 
of ceremony,” Rodriguez-Palacios 
said. “My college only had student 
speakers, which was fine, but if we 
want to attract more high-profile 
speakers, we’ll need a bigger audi-
ence.”

How green is UCSD? Maggie 
Souder, the campus’ new sustainability 
coordinator, is about to find out.

Souder, a UC Riverside alumna 
with more than 24 years of experi-
ence in environmental preservation, 
was appointed to the newly created 
coordinator position before the start 
of Fall Quarter. The coordinator is 
responsible for synchronizing all of 
UCSD’s sustainability efforts in order 
to increase the effectiveness of the pro-
grams and help the university achieve 
its environmental goals. Souder will 
work with the many committees, cam-
pus departments and student organi-
zations involved in decreasing UCSD’s 
environmental impact and promoting 
sustainable living.

“There’s all this effort, but it’s never 
really been coordinated,” Souder 
said. “One of the main [tasks] will 
be to talk to everybody on campus, 
find out what’s 
going on and 
then have a cen-
tral place where 
people can go 
to learn about 
campus sustain-
ability.”

her position 
as a  campus 
resource, and 
feels her guid-
ance will allow staff and students

President George W. Bush sur-
prised the Democratic Congress last 
week by signing the College Cost 
Reduction and Access Act of 2007 
— legislation that would increase the 
maximum Pell Grant by more than 
$500 as well as lower interest rates 
on subsidized Stafford student loans 
— a move that could significantly 
benefit lower- to middle-income stu-
dents struggling to afford skyrocket-
ing tuition fees.

Bush’s decision will raise the Pell 
Grant maximum to $4,800 in the next 
academic year and $5,400 by 2012, 
while interest rates on undergradu-
ate Stafford loans will drop from 6.8 
percent to 3.4 percent over the next 
four academic years.

Pell Grant funding distribution is 
determined by the enrollment size of 
lower-income students attending a 
given university. The boost marks the 
single largest increase in student aid 
since the GI Bill, which was enacted 
in 1944 to assist World War II veter-
ans with loans and educational aid. 

“The government is saving money 
by cutting back on the discount rates 
given to lending companies — caus-
ing lenders to become concerned 
about the future of their business-
es,” UCSD Financial Aid Director 
Vincent De Anda said. “They’ll be 
forced to consolidate their programs 

and [resolve] any complications.” 
The maximum Pell Grant had 

remained stagnant at $4,050 from 
2002-06 but began gaining momen-
tum when Bush signed a February 
funding resolution that enacted 
a $260 increase on the maximum 
award for this academic year. About 
5.3 million low- to middle-income 
students across the nation currently 
qualify for Pell Grants, with 6,600 
UCSD students receiving $952,000 
during the 2006-07 academic year.

A $20-billion reduction in sub-
sidies to loan companies during the 
next fiscal year will allow federal 
administration to fund the increase 
in the maximum Pell Grant award. 

The bill consists of various modi-
fications in both undergraduate and 
graduate financial aid, adding the 
public service loan-forgiveness and 
increasing the income protection 
allowance — the amount of income

To the dismay of many involved 
UCSD students and staff, a state 
appellate court ordered sand dredg-
ing at La Jolla’s Casa Beach — bet-
ter known as the Children’s Pool 
— last month, thereby ousting a 
seal colony that has lived at the site 
for over a decade.

Members of the UCSD commu-
nity have been active participants in 

efforts to preserve the seals’ home 
for several years, despite the site’s 
historic designation as a children’s 
area. Students have volunteered to 
guard the seals’ designated area, 
educated visitors and conducted 
research, while others have written 
letters and spoken at city council 
meetings.

Dredging the sand requires 
city  officials to declare the seals a 
public nuisance and health threat. 
The officials also must acquire per-
mits from the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers and the California 
Coastal Commission, which has a 
history of supporting marine wild-
life.

Jim Hudnall, charter member of 
the Society for Marine Mammalogy 
and the activist who convened the 
first general public meeting at the 
La Jolla Public Library in 1999, said 

he felt let down by the ruling.
“I am dismayed at the appeals 

court’s decision because the La Jolla 
harbor seal rookery is the south-
ernmost [one] in the United States,” 
Hudnall said.

Under a trust established in 1931, 
in which the governor handed over 
certain submerged state lands to the 
city, the beach was intended to be 
a bathing pool exclusively for chil-
dren as well as a public park. More 
than a decade ago, however, seals 
began gathering and finally over-
took the children’s pool, prompting 
the city to limit access to swimmers, 
divers and tourists.

The 4th District Court of Appeals 
ruled 3-0 to restore water quality by 
dredging the sand and removing 
the seals, whose feces are said to

CURRENTS
Medical Professor Awarded 
for Heart-Related Findings

Matthew Allison, assistant adjunct 
professor for the department of family 
and preventive medicine, was pre-
sented with the inaugural Best P.A.D. 
Research Award at the Peripheral 
Arterial Disease Coalition’s annual 
meeting in Washington, D.C.

The award recognizes endeav-
ors in new clinical research relevant 
to understanding the causes, diag-
nostic methods and treatments for 
peripheral arterial disease.

Allison and his colleagues were 
honored for their work on “The Effect 
of Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors 
on the Ethnic-Specific Odds for 
P.A.D. in the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis.” According to the 
study, certain ethnic groups are at 
higher risk for developing P.A.D., with 
an increased risk of 50 percent in 
blacks and a reduced risk in Asians 
and Latinos. 

P.A.D. occurs when arteries in the 
legs become narrowed or clogged 
with fatty deposits, reducing blood 
flow and resulting in leg-muscle 
pain, disability, amputation and an 
increased risk of a heart attack or 
stroke. 

It is unknown whether the dif-
ferences among ethnic groups are 
inherited or a result of the degrees 
of exposure to the more common 
risk factors.

Anorexia Causes Sense-
of-Taste Differences

Women with anorexia have 
unequivocal differences in the insula 
and related brain regions that are 
important for recognizing and judg-
ing taste, according to a new study 
conducted by UCSD and University 
of Pittsburgh researchers. 

The study, led by Walter Kaye 
of the UCSD and University of 
Pittsburgh Schools of Medicine and 
Angela Wagner of the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, also 
suggested a difference in the pro-
cessing of information related to self-
awareness. This finding may shed 
light on the causes of this serious 
mental disorder. 

Researchers examined images of 
the brains of 16 women recovering 
from anorexia and 16 control sub-
jects and measured the brains’ reac-
tions to sucrose, a pleasant taste, 
and distilled water, a neutral taste. 
Imaging results showed a substantial 
reduction in the response to taste 
in women who had recovered from 
anorexia. 

According to Kaye, individuals 
with anorexia may have difficulty  
recognizing taste or responding to 
the pleasure associated with food. 
Food may be perceived as aversive 
— rather than rewarding — because 
the insula and related regions also 
contribute to emotional regulation.

A news article published on Oct. 1 titled “Council Taps External 
Manager to Run Indebted Grove Caffe” incorrectly stated that the 
Grove Caffe is $48,000 in debt. In fact, the Grove is $17,790.05 in debt.
Additionally, a quote attributed to Jason Grishkoff was in fact said by 
Grove employee Matt Finkelstein.

contaminate the water. Court docu-
ments estimate the cost of sand 
dredging to fall between $250,000 
and $500,000.

Hudnall said the land could be 
returned to the state for manage-
ment purposes, rendering the court 
decision moot.

The plan to dredge the beach 
alarmed UCSD professor emeritus 
Douglas L. Inman, a specialist in 
coastal oceanography and sedi-
mentation, because of the impact it 
would have on the beach and those 
surrounding it — including acceler-
ated cliff erosion.

“Two years ago I called a meet-
ing and went to the sight to show 
what would happen,” Inman said. 
“[The meeting] was attended by city 
councilmembers and engineers. It 
would’ve diluted the entire area of 
sand that right now has a tentative 
balance.”

Some have suggested the city 
open the sluiceways, which can serve 
as gates in the breakwater  — origi-
nally meant to be open — to allow 
the ocean water to flow more freely.

“They’ll have to pump sand out 
to open them, but if the sluice gates 
function as they were supposed to, 
it would re-establish some equilib-
rium,” Inman said.

Rachael VanderWalde is the cur-
rent education and policy direc-

tor for the Animal Protection and 
Rescue League, whose gradu-
ate work at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography was based in infor-
mative signage directly linked to 
the seals.

“Just looking at the trust without 
looking at the biological needs, in 
my opinion, is not the best deci-
sion,” she said.

VanderWalde also said that pub-
lic attitude toward environmental 
causes has drastically changed since 
the trust was drafted in 1930, a 
decade during which the seals were 
hunted to near extinction.

“Over and over again, we hear 
the controversy framed as ‘humans 
versus seals’ when obviously it is 
not — no seal has ever written a let-
ter or given an interview,” professor 
of anthropology Jim Moore said in 
an e-mail. “It is between humans 
with one definition of recreation: 
active, sporty, using the environ-
ment; and humans with another 
definition: passive, watching and 
enjoying the environment.”

The San Diego City Council has 
proposed a compromise by allowing 
swimmers to occupy the pool dur-
ing the summer, while providing 
special protection during the seals’ 
birthing and pupping season from 
December to May by installing a 
rope barrier.

Revelle College junior Aaron 

Hieber has volunteered to guard 
the designated seal area since his 
freshman year.

“The only in-water human use of 
the beach I’ve seen there is an entry 
point for scuba divers,” Hieber said. 
“I feel the best thing to do would be 
to remove the sea wall and restore 
the beach to how it was in 1930, and 
let nature determine what happens 
to the seals when the beach is in its 
natural state.”

Moore said the implications of 
the court’s decision pertain to more 
than just the seals.

“[The seals’] presence is a poten-
tially powerful message to all the 
foreign tourists who visit La Jolla 
that American concern for wildlife 
and the environment is not just 
lip service,” Moore said. “Asking 
Africans to deal with elephants and 
lions in the name of conservation, 
but unwilling to accept any ‘hard-
ships’ ourselves is hypocritical.”

A public opinion poll commis-
sioned by APRL in May showed that 
eight out of 10 San Diegans favor 
limits on use of the Children’s Pool 
to protect the harbor seals.

San Diego City Attorney Michael 
Aguirre said he intends to appeal the 
decision to the California Supreme 
Court.

Council Ponders Grove Debt, 
Makes Plans for Own Surplus

This year’s mellow inaugural A.S. Council meeting began with public input as usual, dur-
ing which the treasurer of the UCSD 
Student Foundation, James Iwaz, chal-
lenged the council in the upcoming 
Chancellor’s 5K run. Iwaz proposed 
that the losing team bake cupcakes 
for the winning team, but his chal-
lenge wasn’t acknowledged until the 
meeting’s end.

During  mem-
bers’ reports, 
Associate Vice 
President of Local 
Affairs Aida 
Kuzucan revealed 
a plan to acquire 
a $5,000 lifetime 
membership in 
the La Jolla City Council, which would 
allow the council more influence in 
local town decisions. 

Associate Vice President  of 
Enterprise Operations Chelsea 
Maxwell gave an update on the Grove 
Caffe, which has yet to open this year 
after racking up more than $17,000 
in debt. The Grove now has a new 
manager in Cleveland Thomas, who 
formerly managed the RIMAC coffee 
cart. Thomas has experience working 
with students, said Maxwell. The cafe 
will open in a couple of weeks.

A.S. President Marco Murillo 
said the expected carryover from last 
year’s A.S. budget had unexpectedly 
increased to over $264,000. In the past 
few years, not all money allocated to 
administrative salaries had been spent, 
with the unused funds “rolling over and 
over and over,” Murillo said. He specu-
lated that these now-freed funds might 
be spent on a new event coordina-
tor position to help convert program-
ming ideas into realities. However, he 
stressed that the windfall was a “one 
time thing,” and creating a permanent 
position with the excess funds would 

have long-term budget effects that the 
council must consider.

In special presentations, Triton Tide 
President and Muir College Council 
Chair Dave Payne reported on the 
group’s activities since the A.S. Council 
cut its funding in last year’s epic budget 
meeting. Triton Tide now has a budget 
of $17,500, and Payne expressed his 
usual gusto regarding UCSD’s “elite 

spirit crew.”
“We’ve done 

more so far than all 
of Fall Quarter last 
year,” he said, refer-
ring to the chalked 
fields exhibiting 
slogans and dou-
bled attendance at 
games.

Triton Tide managed to bring up 
to 772 supporters for a women’s vol-
leyball game this year, doubling the 
attendance of last year’s matches. 

Payne also unveiled a new pro-
posal, which will include a billboard 
on I-5 that advertises UCSD sporting 
events and stretches the budget with 
giveaways that are more economical 
and numerous, like key chains and 
paint.

During question time, Earl Warren 
College Senator Peter Benesch told 
the council he discovered that A.S. 
Safe Ride is not yet operating because 
of an “unfortunate circumstance.” 
Apologizing, Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Sarah Chang clarified 
that Safe Rides would not be dispatched 
until Oct. 11 — as noted in the user 
agreement.

Iwaz’s challenge was finally accept-
ed during open forum by Sixth College 
Senator John Cressey, who encour-
aged council members to participate 
competitively. 

“Otherwise,” he warned, “someone’s 
going to have to spend a lot of time in 
the kitchen.”

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  7

UCSD held five all-campus bac-
calaureates in the mid-1990s that 
successfully recruited prominent 
speakers such as former President 
Bill Clinton, former Sen. Bob Dole, 
Qualcomm CEO Irwin Jacobs and 
social activist Patch Adams. Last 
year, individual college commence-
ment speakers included actor James 
Avery, film producer and alumnus 
Thom Sherman, two professors and 
four UCSD students.

“I went to most of the ceremonies 
last year, and while the speakers were 
all amazing, I can’t remember any 
of their names,” Sandoe said. “I’m 
envious of the past years who heard 
from Bill Clinton or other universi-
ties that are congratulated by very 
inspiring public speakers. I feel that 
it is very important to students to 

get the large-scale graduation that a 
UCSD education deserves.”

The planning committee is com-
prised of 11 undergraduate stu-
dents, one graduate student, Alumni 
Association representatives and sev-
eral provosts. The committee held its 
first meeting on Oct. 3.

University administrators recent-
ly announced that although Spring 
Quarter classes end June 13 next 
year, individual college commence-
ments will be delayed until June 21 
and June 22 due to conflicts in hotel 
and parking availability with the U.S. 
Open, which will be held at La Jolla’s 
Torrey Pines Golf Course the preced-
ing week. The all-campus baccalau-
reate is scheduled for June 20.

a student can earn to qualify for student aid 
eligibility — to $6,000 for dependent students. It 
will also increase independent students’ income 
protection by more than half over the next four 
years, according to FinAid.org publisher Mark 
Kantrowitz. 

“Since the bill pays for the increased student 
aid by cutting lender profits, many lenders will 
be cutting their loan discounts,” Kantrowitz said. 
“I expect that most lenders will eliminate all but 
the 0.25 percent rate reduction for automatic 
debit on consolidation loans, and cut the value 
of discounts on Stafford and PLUS loans in half. 
Fee waivers will also likely be eliminated, but few 
borrowers qualified for these discounts — and 
overall students will gain more than they lose.” 

In addition to the new cap on various loan 
repayment lifespans under the guaranteed-loan 
program — even forgiving the unsettled debt 
from student borrowers for 25 years — the leg-
islation includes the loan forgiveness program, 
focusing on direct-loan borrowers who enter 
public service jobs, created in an attempt to 
motivate more graduates to enter the field. 

The increase in the maximum Pell Grant 
comes with a price — a 61 percent cut in smaller 
programs — one of which is Reading First, 
a federal program that apportions grants to 
increase the strength of reading instruction for 
kindergarten through third grade at low-income 
schools. 

Reading First has been scrutinized due to 
supposed financial conflicts of interest between 
several college-associated consultants. The bill 
also requests that U.S. Secretary of Education 
Margaret Spellings monitor conflicts of interest 
in the educational community.

Education begins at the lowest level and must 
be strengthened in order for students to suc-
cessfully reach the university level, according to 
A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Dorothy 
Young. 

“Academic preparation programs are some-
thing that should have more federal attention,” 
Young said. “How can low-income students 

obtain Pell Grants if they can’t receive the neces-
sary assistance when they’re young?” 

A complete evaluation of the Reading First 
program will be reported next year. 

The income bar that determines eligibility for 
the maximum Pell Grant allowance has also been 
modified in the bill, increasing from $20,000 to 
$30,000, while tuition sensitivity — a govern-
ment regulation that blocks Pell Grant-eligible 
students from receiving their maximum award 
due to their college’s low tuition costs — will be 
eliminated. 

Despite the bill’s $21-billion budget, Pell 
Grant funding has been insufficient in level-
ing out economic inflation, and the program 
is still devalued in real dollars. The maximum 
Pell Grant allowance currently covers only 32 
percent of education fees — losing its capacity 
to alleviate student tuition prices at public four-
year universities. In the 1980s, the maximum Pell 
Grant award assisted with 55 percent of tuition 
expenses.

Kantrowitz and De Anda agreed that despite 
a $1,030 savings over a 10-year repayment peri-
od for the average student — breaking down 
to monthly savings of $8.58 — the reimburse-
ment from reduced interest rates alone is not 
particularly significant to an individual student 
borrower. 

Although the cutbacks on student loan inter-
est rates are beneficial, a more effective way 
to allocate the education budget would have 
been to concentrate solely on increasing the Pell 
Grant maximum even further, De Anda said. 
Instead, the bill includes the entire spectrum of 
undergraduate borrowers rather than targeting 
individuals on the basis of need. 

“If you targeted all that government money 
toward Pell Grants to help poorer students [rath-
er than interest rates], it would have been more 
effective,” De Anda said. “But everyone likes 
lower interest rates, and everyone likes more 
money.”

knowing what projects other campus 
groups are working on.

However, she stresses that cam-
pus sustainability requires everyone’s 
participation, not merely that of a few 
interested individuals.

“What we’re trying to do is help 
our planet, and since no one person 
can achieve that, it’s going to take a real 
community effort,” she said.

A new arrival to UCSD, Souder 
began her campus work by meeting 
with different sustainability groups to 
discuss their interests and goals, and 
then making that information avail-
able campuswide. However,  she hopes 
to accomplish much more in the com-
ing years.

“My long-term goal is to help the 
campus be number one in the world 
in sustainability,” she said. “I want 
people to look at UCSD and say, ‘not 
only were they on the forefront of 
identifying climate changes and world 
problems, but they’re also engaged in 
finding the solution.’”

In June 2005, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox established the Environment 
and Sustainability Initiative, a pro-
gram that aims to facilitate collabo-
ration between campus departments 
and schools in order to confront envi-
ronmental problems. 

About six months later, the cam-
pus created the Advisory Committee 
on Sustainability, a group that aspires 
to increase awareness of and support 
for sustainability activities at UCSD, 
while also promoting education and 
research related to environmentally 
friendly practices. Souder will work 
with both of these programs, as well 
as others involved in facility plan-
ning, including student organizations 
such at the Green Campus Program.

“We have numerous outstanding 
conservation and energy-management 
systems that have been implemented 
and a number of major energy related 
initiatives in planning,” Interim Vice 
Chancellor of Resource Management 

Gary C. Matthews said in an e-mail. 
“To ensure that we address the need to 
communicate our successes as well as 
gather input and suggestions from the 
campus community, we felt it essential 
to develop and fund the position.”

Souder will also work to ensure 
that UCSD complies with the current 
UC Policy on Sustainable Practices 
that applies to all UC campuses.

UCSD is already making signifi-
cant progress in its sustainability 
efforts, Souder said. The Facilities 
Management and Transportation 
and Parking Services campus trans-
portation programs have worked 
hard to reduce carbon dioxide emis-

sions. Fleet Services has purchased 
more than 300 electric vehicles for 
campus use, as well as over 50 hybrid 
vehicles, and the campus shuttles 
run on 20 percent biofuel. UCSD 
also offers several alternative trans-
portation options, including shut-
tles, carpools, vanpools, Triton Bikes 
and the Free Bus Zone.

The campus has also undertak-
en projects to become more energy 
efficient. The Central Utilities Plant, 
which powers most of UCSD, has a 
natural-gas cogeneration facility that 
supplies about 85 percent of campus 
energy needs. And in 2006, a 12.8-kilo-
watt photovoltaic system was installed 
on top of the Powell Structures Lab to 
provide solar energy.

However, UCSD hopes to continue 

expansion and improvement of its sus-
tainability programs. Efforts are being 
made to increase the amount of renew-
able energy used on campus from the 
current 17 percent to 20 percent by 
2010, as well as to install enough solar 
panels to produce one megawatt of 
solar energy by 2014. The campus also 
aspires to increase the number of elec-
tric vehicles used and to drive shuttles 
that run on 100 percent biofuel. Souder 
said she is impressed with the level 
of enthusiasm she has seen at UCSD 
regarding environmental action. 

“I’ve never seen a campus so 
engaged and so interested [in sustain-
ability],” she said.

For Souder, a self-confessed “tree-
hugger,” environmentalism has been a 
life-long commitment.

Her passion has fueled her entire 
career in environmental awareness. 
At UC Riverside, she started out 
as a student collecting hazardous 
waste, and then moved on to hazard-
ous-waste management. She spent 
her last eight years developing and 
managing environmental remedia-
tion efforts, before having what she 
calls an “ah ha!” moment and tran-
sitioning to work on sustainability 
programs.

“This is what I’ve been working for 
all this time,” she said. “The sustain-
ability profession didn’t exist when I 
started out, but it just feels like such 
a natural match for what I’ve always 
wanted to do.”

For now, Souder is focusing her 
attention on uncovering all the cam-
pus has to offer in terms of sustainabil-
ity, and said she is very excited to test 
the limits of her new position.

“There’s so much going on and so 
much interest, that, on one hand, it’s 
like trying to drink from a fire hose,” 
she said. “But, on the other hand, I’ve 
never been happier in my life. It’s a 
good thing I’m thirsty.”

Acknowledging the limits of an occupa-tion’s lifespan might be defeatist to the rank-and-file, but Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox nods to a valid point: “[University] 
chancellors usually serve five-year terms at the 
most,” she told the editorial board at an annual 
lunch meeting. 

And just as one’s mid-life conjures up open 
retrospection (what have I accomplished?), the 
campus should visit Fox’s own mid-life achieve-
ments at UCSD since her arrival in 2004. Fox’s 
first luncheon with the Guardian back then was 
textbook in goal and execution: the hob-knob-
bing and gladhanding yielded stock goals, lofty 
in aim but ultimately weak in realism. Initially, 
among her largest aims was the establishment of 
a lively campus community and identity. 

Her administration’s most utilized tool in 
that effort was the Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction report. The 
report’s methodology was pleasantly ground-
level, allowing scores of student interviewees 
to offer concerns and suggestions about their 
own campus in a more direct fashion. Finally, 
the student’s voice had been consolidated and 
formalized. Under the umbrella of the student 
affairs department, the survey bred a litany of 
subcommittees to analyze and act on students’ 
concerns. 

Fox’s  approach to the U.S.E.S. — self-
evaluation to instigate change — has, at the 
very least, yielded concrete results. Specific lines 
in the U.S.E.S. have spurred specific changes. 
Establishments under heavy student use, such 
as Geisel Library and Subway, are now open late 
into the night. Core centers of student life, such 
as Price Center and Student Center, are under-
going either reconstruction or expansion.

Also, the vein of a college’s student life pumps 
through its housing, an understanding Fox was 
well aware of in 2004. The furthur development 
of on-campus housing would extend a student’s 
on-campus experience, thus strengthening their 
connection to their college, Fox rightly rea-
soned. Recently, housing for graduate students 
was completed to much fanfare, just as housing 
for transfer students has broken ground. The 
two facilities answer Fox’s call to community in a 
hopeful fashion, with underrecognized popula-
tions of students, such as transfers, getting the 
dividends of Fox’s vision.

But improvements are still sorely 
lacking in the undergraduate sphere. Fox 
is suprisingly obtuse regarding heavier, stu-
dent-centric issues. Her response to the recent 
scandal within the Dimensions of Culture pro-
gram was underwhelming and broad, much 
like her response to Student-Run Television’s 
shutdown. Both issues received national press 
attention. Both issues made splashes in student 
life, the kind that aid in the formation of identity. 
Fox’s step-back technique to hot-button issues 
buys her breathing room, but costs her also: An 
undefinable leader can’t produce the inspiration 
needed for a philosophical sea change. And as 
Fox herself acknowledged, UCSD’s student life 

needs a change-by-movement. Service-level 
impacts have been instigated through drives such 
as U.S.E.S., though Fox’s self-admittedly short 
shelf-life conjures another mid-life question: 
What can I still accomplish? With weighty prob-
lems such as parking and undergraduate housing 
still looming, the prospects of Fox fully achieving 
her vision are gloomier than the accomplish-
ments she has already made.

Undergrad Blues Leave Alumni Donors Scarce

Nation Gifts 
Journalists with  
Angry Letters, 
Little Praise 

Before the angry letters start rolling in this year, and before our readers charge us with making any egregious errors or 
being irresponsible journalists, I’m taking the 
opportunity to climb atop my soapbox and get 
this off my chest once and for all. 

Journalists are an underappreciated breed. 
We’re overworked, underpaid and despite our 
best efforts, journalism itself has become a 
dying art, eclipsed by sensational Web pages 
and humor-driven, late-night mock-news 

shows. The tidal wave of change and the inva-
sion of modernity have cast a looming shadow 
over this profession and have all but knocked 
us off our feet. 

And the angry letters keep rolling in.
Despite our withering popularity, the stan-

dards have not fallen. If anything, the public  
— and especially the government — has grown 
increasingly unforgiving and unappreciative 
of our toils. There was a time when America 
considered us the quintessential fourth branch 
of government; now we’re pigeon holed as lib-
eral extremists among a population who takes 
our exposes for granted. 

Though the public may see us romanticized 
through film, tenaciously chasing Superman 
or valiantly unearthing Richard Nixon’s dirty 
secrets, our reality is one far more mun-
dane, and our work far more vilified than 
Hollywood portrays. Our pressroom is dirty, 
our sleep is little and our stakes are high. 

Mistakes mean scornful letters that almost 
depict us as sinners. For our victories, we earn 
no prize — at least not outside personal satis-
faction and the Pulitzer. 

Remember New York Times op-ed writ-
er Joseph Wilson? Probably not; he never 
received his prize either.

Wilson, a former United States ambassador 
to Gabon, traveled to Niger in 2002 at the 
request of the CIA to investigate the possible 
sale of Nigerian uranium to Iraq. By the end 
of his stay Wilson concluded that there was 
little chance, if any, that such an arrangement 
had occurred — an opinion that he shared 
with government officials, including the State 
Department’s African Affairs Bureau.

Less than a year later, with still no reason 
to believe Niger was capable of selling ura-
nium to Iraq, President George W. Bush pub-
licly accused Iraq of attempting to purchase 
uranium from Africa. Wilson later discovered 
the accusation, announced in the president’s 
state of the union address in January 2003, 
was referencing Niger. 

In an effort to bring these government 
inconsistencies to light, Wilson wrote of his 
experience in a July 2003 article in the New 
York Times, in which he criticized the admin-
istration for “[going] to war under false pre-
tenses.”

Shortly after, in an act of retaliation, 
government officials leaked the identity of 
Wilson’s wife — prominent CIA operative 
Valerie Plame — to the press. The events 
spurred an FBI investigation during which I. 
Lewis “Scooter” Libby, former chief of staff to 
Vice President Dick Cheney, was accused and 
eventually charged with perjury and obstruct-
ing justice. He was sentenced to two-and-a-
half years in prison. 

Despite the fact that Wilson’s reporting 
experience was a one-time deal, his story, and 
the personal abuse it earned him, illuminates 
the unfortunate byproduct of being a journal-
ist — intense and often unjust criticism. 

Judith Miller, another New York Times 
reporter notorious for her coverage of Iraq’s 
possible weapons of mass destruction, also 
experienced this hostility first hand. Miller,

When UCSD began its billion-dollar fundraising campaign seven years ago, consultants were skeptical. 
They challenged the university’s status as a 
pubescent school and questioned its ability to 
garner needed levels of financial support from 
alumni just now approaching their 50s. 

But Chancellor Marye Anne Fox had other 
plans. Realizing that UCSD’s youth would like-
ly limit possible donations from alumni, cam-
paign leaders targeted private organizations, 
including the Skaggs Insitute for Research 
(which gave $30 million to the university).

Now, however, with the colossal “What’s 
Next” campaign completed, and the univer-
sity an astounding $1.03 billion wealthier, it 
is the perfect time to re-examine the college’s 
approach and determine where future efforts 
would be most effectively directed.  Do we 
stick with our traditional approach of appeal-
ing to San Diego’s bevy of biotech companies, 
or do we turn to our aging alumni base? 

One thing is clear: While consultants may 
have pegged the school’s age as an insur-
mountable obstacle toward fundraising efforts 
with alumni, a more problematic handicap is 
UCSD’s undergraduate environment. Before 
we can attract a thick alumni base, graduating 
seniors need to leave UCSD feeling connected, 
feeling like the four years they spent here were 
four years they could not have spent anywhere 
else.  

For this to happen, students need to 
experience both community and satisfaction 
throughout the course of their stay — some-
thing the campus’ disunity has yet to allow, as 
the Undergraduate Student Experience and 
Satisfaction report indicates.

Until the administration can find remedies 
for the UCSD’s lingering internal problems, 
the safest course for future campaigns is also 
the most traditional one.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

By Marissa Blunschi
Associate Opinion Editor

STUDENT CENTERS AND 
HEALTH — After several years of 
slipping deeper into debt — and 
many failed efforts by the A.S. 
Council to stop the bleeding — it 
seemed as though the Grove Caffe 
might be rescued by the Rady School 
of Management last May. Plans of a 
partnership were meant to bolster 
the Grove’s profits and bring a fresh 
approach to its marketing strategies 
while preserving 
it as a student-
run enterprise. 

Alas, not long 
after dialogue 
had been initi-
ated between the 
A.S. Council, the 
Rady School and 
Grove employees, 
it became appar-
ent that the Grove 
needed more sta-
ble and perma-
nent management 
than the Rady 
School could offer, if the historical 
coffee shop hoped to survive.

Without the Rady School to 
dig the Grove out of debt, the A.S. 
Council has elected to appoint an 
external manager to regain control 
of the Grove’s finances in hopes of 
ensuring stability for the fraught 
A.S. enterprise. However, deciding 
to hire a non-student manager won’t 
alleviate the Grove’s ever-escalat-
ing debt, which soared to approxi-
mately $17,000 before the original 
owner, Ron Carlson, liquidated his 
50-percent ownership of the Grove’s 
contract last spring. This gives good 
reason to be skeptical as to how 
drastically new management would 

benefit the struggling A.S. enter-
prise.

The Grove first burst on to the 
campus scene 21 years ago with 
its unique, hipster vibe and serene, 
pre-Price Center atmosphere. The 
Associated Students had high hopes 
for the restaurant, aiming to create 
a largely student-run business that 
would provide young entrepreneurs 
with hands-on business experience, 
and customers with economically 
and socially conscious products. 
A.S. Enterprise Operations encour-

aged the devel-
opment of stu-
dent services at 
the Grove to the 
point of running 
a continual defi-
cit. After a long 
history of finan-
cial fluctuations 
and the liquida-
tion of Carlson’s 
ownership, the 
Grove found 
itself in a des-
perate situation, 
possibly facing 

closure. Unfortunately, the Grove 
received minimal assistance from 
the A.S. Council, which had left the 
indebted coffeehouse on the back 
burner for a little too long — its 
problems have only been continuing 
to worsen.

At this point, it would take 
almost a miracle to save the Grove. 
Without its distinctiveness as a stu-
dent-run enterprise, the Grove has 
lost part of what makes it stand 
out as UCSD’s original coffee shop. 
Although the Grove certainly can no 
longer continue on its current path 
as a student-run business (incur-

also involved the in the leak case and 
believed to have evidence regarding 
the disclosure of Plame’s identity, 
was jailed in 2005 or her refusal to 
testify before a grand jury about the 
information.  Despite widespread 
public opposition over her decision, 
Miller unflinchingly stood by her 
actions.

These stories, however, are only 
the half of it. The profession, by 
nature, forces journalists to have 
thick skin, so criticism we can 
handle. It’s the obliviousness of 
the American public that gets me 
down.

I remember the first time my 
name appeared in print — I was 

drunk with excitement; I felt vener-
ated and hopeful. But it didn’t last 
long. Now I see how forgotten we 
are. 

From Wilson, to Miller, to 
Seymour Hersh, to Ida Tarbell and 
Murray Waas, most Americans have 
no idea who these people are — 
and yet their contributions to this 
nation’s political society are undeni-
able.  

Maybe it’s lagging readership, 
maybe it’s disinterest, maybe it’s mod-
ern media getting in the way, but any 
way you look at it it’s a sad view. 

I’m not trying to toot my own horn 
or elevate the marginalized efforts of 
American journalists everywhere. All 
I’m saying is that it would be nice 

if once in a while the angry letters 
weren’t, well, quite so angry and the 
bylines not quite so forgotten. At the 
very least I wish America could recog-
nize its most dedicated and investiga-
tive journalists — people like Miller 
and Hersh.

I won’t hold my breath for the res-
urrection of newspaper appreciation 
and journalists everywhere will just 
keep on keeping on. If by chance, how-
ever, you should find yourself wander-
ing campus between classes this week, 
twiddling your thumbs with nothing 
to do, grab some coffee and a copy of 
the New York Times. Find a shady spot 
to settle down, pull up a chair and 
actually read it. I dare you.

ring further debt along the way), it 
may come as an upset that student-
employees will no longer have the 
same access to applied practice in 
small-business management as they 
have for the past 21 years. By bring-
ing in outside management, the A.S. 
Council is simultaneously taking 
away much of what sets the Grove 
Caffe apart from the multitude of 
coffee shops on the UCSD campus. 

Besides excising tradition, the 
A.S. Council is also spending a great 
deal of money 
by bringing in 
a new manage-
rial system for the 
Grove. Obviously, 
hiring a new, 
outside manager 
is significantly 
more expen-
sive than hiring 
UCSD students 
— a precarious 
move, especially 
when there is no 
guarantee that 
new management will save the Grove 
from extinction. Unstable manage-
ment aside, there are multiple prob-
lems that have been contributing to 
the Grove’s tremendous deficit over 
the past several years that must also 
be addressed. 

One problem that undoubtedly 
damages business at the Grove is that 
its salads, sandwiches and cappuc-
cinos, though delicious, can often be 
found at many, much more conve-
nient locations on campus. Virtually 
every UCSD cafeteria offers similar 
items that can be purchased with pre-
paid meal points, and the dozens of 
coffee carts and restaurants in Price 
Center and all over campus are virtu-

ally unavoidable for students walking 
to and from their classes. The Grove, 
on the other hand, is generally out of 
the way for many students, nestled 
away in the serene Student Center. 
On top of that, the never-ending con-
struction does little to help persuade 
potential Grove customers to step 
inside the restaurant even if they hap-
pen to be famished and wandering 
near Revelle College.  

To address these issues, the Grove 
clearly needs better advertising to 
bring in more business, but even more 

so, it needs to 
introduce more 
unique products 
and services to 
keep its custom-
ers coming back 
for more.  

Clearly, if 
the Grove Caffe 
hopes to serve 
customers for 
another 21 years 
to come, its new 
m a n a g e r w i l l 
have his work cut 

out for him. Though it has become a 
small landmark on campus with its 
scenic patio, tasty dishes and foamy 
lattes, the Grove has quite a way to go 
before its charm wins over the hearts 
of the multitude of customers that it 
needs if it wants to emerge from the

A.S. Enterprises) barely turns a profit. 
Now, we can only hope that the new 
management that the A.S. Council 
elected will have the persistence, deter-
mination and the revolutionary ideas 
to turn the Grove around, bringing 
it back to its original level when it 
opened its doors as the first coffee shop 
on campus. Otherwise, let’s hope the 
A.S. Council has a plan B.

PJ Harvey
■ White Chalk
ISLAND

B rooding singer-songwriter P.J. Harvey slumps, hung in a vintage gown, hair ung-roomed. Even before we wrangle off the 
plastic wrap, it’s easy to deduct what kind of 
album this will be: Hers is a haunting portrait, 
ghostly in the spotlight — a Sylvia Plath bride, a 
Diane Arbus silhouette, a modern-day Ophelia.

We saw it coming in 2004’s Uh Huh Her, as 
Harvey reined her gait by stripping instrumenta-
tion and lowering vocals to a whisper. On White 
Chalk, the childish musings are familiar in tone, 
but now completely lack their veil of intrigue. 
Deep-throated echoes and punky whines from 
past albums fall to the wind of a new ethe-
real haunting, as comprehensive as underwater 
whale calls. Both “Before Departure” and “The 
Mountain” — long, drawn-out affairs stranded 
in painfully predictable arrangements, thrill-
ing as an afternoon with a windup music box 
— lose themselves in sparse keys and operatic 
moans. “Piano” and “Broken Harp” come clos-
est to the grittier blues of Dry, but neither singer 

nor song ever gets a grip, as Harvey trades in her 
fiery guitar anthems and punk nihilism for the 
lackluster piano recital that is White Chalk.

It would be unfair to critique this chameleon 
for departing from her past. After all, her abil-
ity to sound completely unlike herself is exactly 
what drives her fame: Harvey is notoriously hard 
to pinpoint, constantly recreating and decon-
structing her fluid sound. She’s long managed 
to adapt and sample techniques from a range 
of genre-defining contemporaries (including 
Tom Waits, Cat Power, even Elvis Costello) 
while still remaining distinct as a memory . 
White Chalk, however, sees the least-creative 
Harvey to date — Harvey dabbling in tired New 
Age, Harvey sampling the worst of Tori Amos, 
Harvey thrown to the whales for good.

PJ Harvey performs live Oct. 15 at Orpheum 
Theatre in Los Angeles.

G&D
■ The Message
LOOK

I f you knew the world was ending in five mor-tal years, what would your message sound like? For ex-Stones Throw groovies Georgia 
Anne Muldrow and Dudley Perkins (or G&D, 
if you’re hip to that cosmos), the Mayans’ 
pending 2012 apocalypse apparently warrants 
an invitational floodgate for their scrambled 
philosophies — on love, peace, time, space, 
higher powers, oneness with the earth and most 
everything else worth pondering over a godsent 
psychedelic funk drift.

It wouldn’t be surprising to learn that The 
Message was recorded in a single take. A slaugh-
tering of messy harmonies and dream-state 
tangents, pulled over roughly 10 full-length 
tracks, are then thrown into the wastebasket 
with an equal number of seeming outtakes: self-
indulgent skits, fragments of long-lost Muldrow 
beats (from her not-so-long-ago gig as that 
mysterious sprig of springtime pine on Stones 
Throw compilations) and uncomfortably long 
moments in which it seems someone must have 

accidentally left on the open mic.
Accordingly, their project can only be fully 

appreciated during that first chaotic listen. After 
enduring 45 raw, hard minutes of G’s wet-paint 
neo-soul — possibly the freshest, most difficult-
to-wrangle out there — with D’s jumbled premo-
nitions heaped atop like 40 slo-mo, drugged and 
brainwashed Busdrivers, we emerge cleansed 
and triumphant (if only to have survived what at 
first felt like warped hip-hop torture — until we 
realized that beauty is pain.)

You may snicker now, but we’ll see who’s 
laughing when Perkin’s doomsday has indeed 
arrived. Or sooner, even: “Critics? The hell 
with the critics! La la la la!” he squeals to the 
heavens, where even the supreme being himself 
can’t look away.

G&D will host an official listening party at 
Dream Street in Ocean Beach on Oct. 13.

SD CONVENTION CENTER/ OCT. 7 / 7 P.M. / $20
One piece of Trillville (the rap group that made the wood-

creak beat famous with 2005’s “Some Cut”), Lil’ Scrappy 
might be too throwback or obscure for Dirty South fans, 
especially considering today’s revolving door of Southern rap 
stars. But considering that big-market revivals fall flat (see, 
Chingy), it might be due time to revisit high school’s musical 
requirements (a.k.a. can I shake my goods to it?). Plus, Jim 
Jones, creator of the summertime stomp-beat “Ballin’,” and 
Motor City’s own Shane Capone. (CN)

Port O’Brien
THE CASBAH / OCT. 10 / 8:30 P.M. / $14

They may only be openers for Rogue Wave, but when a 
Bay Area/Alaska buzz pack is dubbed best new band by the 
M. Ward, there’s definitely magic in the air. Citing everyone 
from Spoon to Neil Young as inspiration, it’s hard not to draw 
comparisons with yesteryear’s classic rock and latter-day indie 
folk, yet they’ve definitely got something of their own – wisps 
of Bay fog plumped with small-town Alaskan hoke – that 
suggests their status as a songwriting juggernaut.

Created in Kodiak, Ala. by fisherman/boathand 
twentysomething Van Pierszalowski, who also spent time in 
Cambria, Calif., Port O’Brien quickly rocketed by sharing stages 
with the likes of Modest Mouse and Bright Eyes – (and all this 
when their average age was a mere 21). Makes you wish you 
had signed on that fishing vessel as a teen, eh? (CM)

CANES BAR & GRILL / OCT. 7 / 7:30 P.M. / $20

Nothing makes me wanna “get drunk and freaky-fied” 
with mah ladies like fancy Paris electro-chick Uffie, lending the 
finishing party-girl touch to the best dance album of the year, 
without a shadow of a doubt: Justice’s wet, urban Cross. Crazy-
catchy single “D.A.N.C.E.” barbed hipsters and boutique playlists 
worldwide with its irresistable swells of kiddie-choir, even 
securing a spot next to Video-of-the-Year nominees like Beyonce 
and Justin Timberlake (and ultimately losing to the unbeatable 
Rihanna) on MTV. Though their grungy thump is probably 
better danced to in the privacy of your own sweaty closet, air 
and compare those killer moves this Sunday in Canes’ sea of 
worshippers, all without dirtying the morning’s fresh sin-slate 
— just keep your eyes locked on that glowing cross. (SW)

Bruce Springsteen
■ Magic
SONY

W hen Bruce Springsteen hit 1982, still reel-ing from the success of Born to Run, his darker side took over: He ditched his 
fellow E-Streeters for Nebraska, a set of bare-
boned demos with nihilistic lyrics that wore 
his trademark husk down to a Midwestern 
tornado.

Twenty-five years later, the Boss serves up 
Magic, his second single-word title — and it’s 
how Nebraska might’ve sounded had he perme-
ated the gloom with a little E-Street sunshine via 
2002’s The Rising, with as much range in tempo 
as 1980’s The River.

At most, Magic is a series of finely crafted 
pop songs fit for radio play, from rip-roaring 
opener “Radio Nowhere” to the politically laced 
“Last To Die.” They’re carefully penned, but it’s 
sleep-stuff from the man who single-handedly 
resurrected the soul of rock ‘n’ roll — gone are 
the starry-eyed tales Springsteen told to his 
rabble-rousing fanbase, the freewheelin’ rock-
outs that made us want to kiss our gals and 

drive straight off dead man’s curve. Instead, we 
get broken — if salvageable — mirrors. “Your 
Own Worst Enemy” is a worthy grab at 1960s 
nostalgia, but sticks out sore alongside “Gypsy 
Biker,” subdued alt-rock in which the band plays 
more as filler than proud members of a legend-
ary ensemble.

Magic has all the ingredients for raw 
Springsteen gold, but that key element —  a 
long-lost magic — is still missing, as each track 
drops off the radar like a burned-out caddy. It’s 
been a few years since Springsteen ditched the 
amp for folkie flannel and a guitar-as-shotgun 
stance, so maybe the strings are a bit stiff — and 
hey, he may not be rocking like the good ol’ 
days, but at least he’s giving a wholehearted stab 
at the present.

Bruce Springsteen performs live Oct. 29 and 
30 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.

Manu Chao
■ Radiolina
BECAUSE

I f, for any number of reasons, you are thinking about investing in the work of Manu Chao — you know, heard him at a super-cool party, 
stumbled across him at Coachella, finally tuned 
in to the rest of the world’s best musical inclina-
tions and/or caught wind of Chao’s genre- and 
language-blending “multi-kulti” aesthetic — do 
not start here. 

Instead, pick up a copy of Dimanche á 
Bamako by Malian blind couple Amadou & 
Mariam, with full production and contribu-
tions by Manu Chao.

Or any of a decade’s worth of albums by 
early-’90s Ukranian-American band Gogol 
Bordello, who opened a few Manu Chao shows 
earlier this year with their Negra-derived “gypsy 
punk.”

Or, honestly, anything else the man 
has touched. But at the top of the list, put 
Clandestino (1998), Casa Babylon (1994) and 
tickets to a live show before he turns 50 in 
2011.

Okay, so the new one’s not that bad. It 
couldn’t possibly be — this is the legendary 
Manu Chao, who has rallied artists and peoples 
across the globe since 1989, with or without 
French group Mano Negra. It could even be 
called great when lined up with the majority of 
2007s crop.

And maybe, if yours are ears not yet sea-
soned to his feathery rhythms and warm melo-
dies and gentle Spanish politics, you won’t even 
need to forgive dear, aging Manu a few recycled 
hooks and sound bytes.

But to those ears, bodies and minds that 
worshipped those same hooks and sound bytes 
for years (the last six without any new stu-
dio material to wrap around), La Radiolina 
is the anticlimax of a lifetime, dominated by 
lesser variations on songs we’ve already loved 
to death.

W ith a resume like Ang Lee’s, a new intrigue-laced war film promises to be much 
more than another humdrum roll 
in the cinematic hay. In the same 
vein as last blockbuster “Brokeback 
Mountain,” Lee’s latest showcases 
talented unknowns, graphic sex 
scenes and stunning cinematogra-
phy. But here is where the similar-
ity ends  — the seasoned director 
leaves Montana behind for a war-
threatened 1938 Hong Kong, and 
the Japanese-occupied Shanghai in 
1942.

“Lust, Caution” follows a group 
of six student actors as they resist 
the encroaching Japanese regime 

with an underground theater. 
Thrust to the forefront of these 
quiet rebels is the angelic Wang 
Jiazhi (Wei Tang, in her first-ever 
movie role), forced to become 
China’s serpent in the grass, slowly 
whittling away pieces of her iden-
tity to become the bourgeois adul-
teress of Mae Tai Tai.

Lee’s contemporary creation is 
a visual triumph, weaving its way 
through wartime realities and the 
many sacrifices made on every 
behalf, as Wang slowly seduces the 
cruel and domineering Mr. Yee 
(Tony Leung), head of the ruth-
less, Japanese-collaborating secu-
rity forces. But before we can write 
“Lust” off as a hackneyed wartime

Photography’s ability to capture yet simultaneously distort the essence of 
different objects is the central thesis of Roy 
McMakin’s exhibition at Quint Gallery. His 
fifth exhibition is stripped down to two 
found tables — guess what colors — and 
select collaged photographs that reexam-
ine the relationship between object and 
lens. McMakin has digitalized the col-

lage method into a new system in which 
over 100 photographs comprise a single 
table. This recomposition of shots elimi-
nates the three-point perspective inherent 
in single frame photographs, so that solely 
perfect lines comprise the image. His work 
attempts to construct a new photographic 
perspective, and questions ways the camera 
shapes our perceptions.

P erception also went under the micro-scope at the turn of the century, when 
artists began to reexamine the role of light 
in images and image construction. Their 
exploration took place outside the camera 
but inside the canvas. Impressionists from 
or near Giverny, France, a countryside art-
ists’ haven, pushed the possibilities of light 
and shadow through their blurred land-
scapes of lilyponds and rural village life. 

Including works by major artists such as 
Claude Monet, Theodore Robinson, John 
Leslie Breck and Pierre Bonnard, all works in 
the exhibition are investigations into paint-
ing’s capacity to convey without mirroring.

12  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2007

love story a la “Pearl Harbor,” the film throws us 
into an interpersonal loop of uninhibited passion 
and twisted affection. As Wang lures Yee closer 
to her body and mind, both characters become 
entangled in a web of love and hate.

Lee uses disturbingly violent sex scenes to 
demonstrate the frustration between the two lov-
ers as they tear each other apart emotionally. As 
in Nagisa Oshima’s “In the Realm of the Senses,” 
clothes are ripped in a lustful rage almost pal-
pable in the characters’ eyes. Lee’s film is swept up 
and stolen by Wang and Yee as their relationship 
drives the plot forward, the war taking a backseat 
to steamy intrigue.

At times, however, Lee slows up the pace to 
meander through the lives of the other characters 
that remain, for the most part, white noise. Aside 
from Wang and Yee, other insurgents, like Kuang 
Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang) and Old Yu (Chung 
Hua Tou) fade into the background without mak-
ing much of an impression. It’s almost as if Lee is 
trying to slow the roll of the film to simply peruse 
a twirl of cigarette smoke or capture the vivid red 
of Wang’s lips — perhaps to legitimize his scenes 
of vicious hate-making.

But “Lust” keeps the story intact as it jumps 
from the lovers’ first meeting to their “serendipi-
tous” encounter five years later. Where the plot 
lags in places, it makes up for with hand-held 
images of lust and the constant emotional mys-
tery between Wang and her mark. She is the pic-
ture of elusive beauty, her body language all but 
nonexistent in the wake of such a heart-stopping 
gaze — in fact, every other scene sees her ignite 
emotional turmoil all in the bat of eye.

The only faults of “Lust” might be found in the 
indulgent lengths to which Lee takes his sexual 
zeal and the amount of time he takes to get to the 
point. Like “Brokeback Mountain,” Lee’s newest is 
based on a short story, this time by Eileen Chang. 
Both take a simple tale of complicated affection 
and stretch it almost to the breaking point of pace 
— some two and half hours later.

But moments of remarkable poignancy recline 
in even the most lethargic of scenes. Like the final 
clip, which features a simple play of shadows 
across a rumpled bedsheet, leaving the lasting 
breath of artistic awe that has lifted Lee to his 
revered reputation.

MOTIONS OF A CITY

E vident from its opening scene — four women playing an intense and subtly violent game of mahjong — “Lust, Caution” is a film grounded in tension. This tension 
unfolds in the streets and back alleys of Shanghai, one which 
arises from politics but is later articulated through sexuality 
and, finally, love. Like its story, the city contains enough con-
flict and friction to be epic on its own.

Ang Lee casts a fine light on the historic conditions that 
gave birth to this port city (literally: “on the sea”). The Japanese 
invasion, featured prominently, and the western occupation 
(revealed but not discussed) are mere backdrops to the erotic 
trysts.

Yet to view mid-century Shanghai under Lee’s detailed 
cinematography is reason enough for Sundance gold — from 
broad shots of tree-lined French Concession avenues to 
faithful portrayals of Shanghai life (eternal rain). At times, 
the film loses itself to these details: steaming soups cupped 
in porcelain, flights of mahogany stairs, the shine of lucky 
mahjong tiles.

Lee is Dicksonian in his capturing of Shanghai, neither 
neglecting the terrifically poor, whose daily ration of rice is 
marked on their fingers in ink, nor shying from the outra-
geously wealthy, who banter over five-carrot diamonds like 
dessert, and who loan cars like cardigans. In “Lust,” we follow 
not only the motions between two lovers, but also the motions 
of a city. And in the words of Salman Rushdie: with motion, 
comes friction.

14  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2007

year fight to acquire the rights to the book and 
the consent of the McCandless famiy, Penn’s 
pet-project endurance has paid off: His film 
finds every shade of unintentional beauty in 
the young traveler’s quest for enlightenment, 
a worthy extension of the rugged individual-
ism preached by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jack 
London and others of the “Walden” tradition.

Along a swirling string of adventures, young 
talent Emile Hirsch — so spotless in his Oscar-
warranting embodiment of the wide-eyed trav-
eler that he is almost not worth identifying 
as anyone other than McCandless, —  takes 
up with an on-the-rocks hippie couple (Brian 
Dierker and the matriarchal Catherine Keener), 
finds work with a grizzled Dakota farmer (the 
brutally realistic Vince Vaughn), ends up on Los 
Angeles’ skid row and, in the most moving of his 
episodes, creates a father-son bond with a wilted 
veteran (Hal Holbrook). The boy is able to form 
the kind of family on the road that he never had 
back home, his blood relations glimpsed only 
through a sister’s narration and old Super-8 
images of his folks (William Hurt, Marcia Gay 
Harden). But they’re suburbanite monstrosities 
of a consumer culture that McCandless wants 
nothing to do with.  Ahead lies only Alaska, his 
promised land.

Penn expertly contrasts these journeys with 
a now 24-year-old McCandless in the Alaskan 
wilderness, at adventure’s end, where he finds 

refuge in an abandoned schoolbus — unaware 
of nature’s impartiality — and begins con-
structing the isolated utopia that will ultimately 
seal his fate. Cinematographer Eric Gautier 
captures the isolating vastness of McCandless’ 
space, alternating panoramas and close-ups to 
the husky acoustics of Eddie Vedder, whose 
songs transform stunning images of nature into 
a philosophical manifesto. It all peaks when 
Hirsch has ultimately faded from fresh-faced 
idealist to rag-and-bones survivor during the 
last moments of life. At that point, Penn’s cut-
throat direction and the actor’s remarkable craft 
unveil a stark and painful reality: the logistics of 
literally starving to death.

Although some moments are laid on a little 
thick — and despite the fact that Penn has 
never met a montage he didn’t like (how else to 
compact a film whose first cut was supposedly 
five hours?) — “Into the Wild” is a perspec-
tive-jolter for we soon-to-be graduates who 
still dream of being the wealthiest man on the 
block. Some may argue the film glorifies an 
unprepared idiot, but to reduce him to such is 
to misunderstand McCandless’ purpose. Sure, 
his quest to become a sort of self-sufficient 
monk did ultimately cause his demise, but this 
outcome can only negate his living intentions 
as much as any human end. His death makes 
his path no different than ours — except that 
his, a chosen flight through fire and ice, is a 
resounding testament to an extraordinary will.

Alt-Rock Mainstay Unplugs to Take 
Penn’s Filmic Opus ‘Into the Wild’

▶ WILD, from page 10

Eddie Vedder
■ Into the Wild
J-RECORDS

T he grand tradition of artist/film pair-ups (most famously, Simon & Garfunkel/“The Graduate”) is an intimate method 
of storytelling that almost gives its musicians 
a supporting role. Now, eager “Into the Wild” 
writer/director Sean Penn recruits Pearl Jam 
frontman Eddie Vedder to carry one troubled 
American rebel across purple mountain and 
fruited plain, with nothing but some rusty 
strings and soul-searching poetics to guide 
him.

Though it’s a dark little treasure, Penn’s 
film is highly simplistic and naive — not 
necessarily to a fault, considering this is the 
very spirit that drives its protagonist to his 
deathbed. What better voice, then, to power 
the film’s every becoming-a-man-in-the-’90s 
montage, than Vedder, the hands-down lead-
er of the post-grunge, alterna-radio pack? 
“Society, crazy indeed!” he crows on “Society,” 
stocked with sentiments as literal as the tipsy 
bar-scene monologue it tributes. Penn may 
be a creative genius, but he doesn’t let that get 
in the way of his most humble fascination: 
the cliche condition of the outsider.

But Vedder is not the same older-brother 
figure that soundtracked our generation’s 
awkward stage. Unplugged, Penn-tousled 
and distracted enough by this new sense 
of purpose to lose the Creed intonation 
that has come to parody the alt-rock boom, 

Vedder now wears the weight of 21st-century 
know-better. His stadium yowl slows to a 
weathered sigh (with the exception of Indio 
cover “Hard Sun,” on which he feels he must 
out-belt featured girl power Corinn Tucker, 
of Sleater-Kinney), leaning more toward 
Leonard Cohen’s careful love-of-words than 
Nickelback’s nostril-flared hangover babble 
— undoubtedly of Pearl Jam inspiration. 

Of course, nothing scores the Alaskan 
outback better than silence, and the few 
scenes that hold out on song certainly crawl 
deepest into our psyche. But in fleshing out 
the post-college angst of a regular kid driven

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2007

By Neil Joshi
Contributing Writer

Fresh off its most successful sea-
son ever, the men’s tennis team is 
confident that it has the talent in 
place to make a run at another 
Final Four showing this year. In 
the season-opening Intercollegiate 
Tennis Associate Western Regional 
Championship, held from Sept. 27 
to Sept. 29, the Tritons started a 
potential title-winning season in 
style, capturing the doubles tourna-
ment and fielding the runner-up in 
the singles competition.

UCSD’s leading doubles team, 
seniors Eric Rubens and Blake 
Meister, took the doubles crown 
with an exciting 9-8 victory over 
the Hawaii Pacific University duo 
of Hendrick Bode and Nikola 
Petrov. The championship match 
ended with a tiebreaker, when the 
score reached 8-8. That’s when the 
Rubens/Meister duo, which capital-
ized on a break of serve at 8-7 to 
force the tiebreak, clinched the vic-
tory with a 7-4 scoreline. 

Meister was quick to note that 
the eight-game pro set format of the 
doubles tournament is difficult to 
adjust to, since it differs from the 
singles’ format.

“There’s no room for error in 
a pro set,” he said. “It’s impor-
tant to jump on opponents early. 
Experience in these close matches 
will help us down the line.” 

The win sends the teammates to the 
Wilson ITA National Championship 
in Mobile, Ala. where they will be 
part of an eight-team tournament 
featuring regional champions from 
around the country. The tournament 
runs from Oct. 11 through Oct. 14.

Head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
expects the two to lead the team once 
again.

“Right now we have to expect our 
upperclassmen to carry us,” he said. 
“It is great for our two seniors, ranked 
in the top five in Division II last year 
to start out with a win.” 

Steidlmayer added that success in 
preseason tournaments would give 
the Tritons confidence as they enter 
the conference season and the NCAA 
D-II championships.

With three starters gone from last 

year’s Final Four team, the Tritons are 
looking for some new faces to make 
an impact. Undoubtedly, sophomore 
Bijan Moallemi looks primed for a 
huge season as one of UCSD’s best 
singles players. 

Moallemi received a special 
entrance as a wild card into the sin-
gles tournament of the ITA Western 
Regional Championship, and used it 
to waltz his way to the finals. 

Even though Moallemi’s brilliant 
run was halted in the finals by the 
top-seeded Bode, the Del Mar, Calif. 
native sent a message to his team-
mates that he is a force to be reckoned 
with.

Junior Kazumi Negishi thinks 
that he is prepared to make a lasting  
impression as well, and is confident 
that the team can build off of its past 
triumphs to win a championship.

“We set a high standard with our 
school-record performance last sea-
son, but our goal now is to win it all,” 
Negishi said. “We’re not worried too 
much about other teams right now; 
we’re focused on ourselves.” 

UCSD’s fall season highlights 
include the Chandler Cup at UC 
Berkeley from Oct. 26 to Oct. 28, 
followed by the Southern California 
Intercollegiates in Los Angeles from 
Oct. 31 to Nov. 4.

The UCSD women’s tennis team has 
a new look this year, with head coach 
Liz LaPlante welcoming seven fresh-
men into the mix. The Tritons hope to 
reclaim their spot atop the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, which 
is an attainable goal as LaPlante has 
guided UCSD to four consecutive divi-
sion titles and an impressive 40 straight 
wins in conference. 

In addition to the win streak, UCSD 
made the CCAA All-Conference selec-
tions its own personal trophy case. 
LaPlante, who has been the head coach 
at UCSD for 28 years, took home Coach 
of the Year — her fourth — and fielded 
a stacked team that had four of the nine 
All-Conference First Team selections.

Three of those women returned this 
season, with junior Ina Dan leading the 
way as UCSD’s top returnee. Dan had 
a memorable 2006-07 season, tying for 
the team lead with 14 wins in singles, 
and leading the team with 15 wins 
in doubles. Her versatility as a dual 

threat will be instrumental in fulfill-
ing the Tritons’ hopes of reaching the 
NCAA tournament this year.

Joining her will be two fellow first-
teamers, senior Justine Ang Fonte and 
sophomore Pooja Desai. Desai was 
named Freshman of the Year and was 
the only newcomer to make First-Team 
All Conference. It’s easy to make the 
first-team when you put up the kind of 
results Pooja did last year: As a singles 
player she was undefeated, going 6-0 
as the No. 4-ranked singles player and 
then 3-0 at No. 3. LaPlante expects 
more of the same this year.

Veterans of the women’s tennis team 
will be joined by an eclectic group of 
freshmen, who come to the program  
pressured to sustain the excellence that 
their predecessors have achieved in 
recent years. 

LaPlante is confident that UCSD 
can preserve its status as a juggernaut in 
the CCAA, even with all the newcom-
ers. LaPlante called this incoming class 
“ the strongest group of players I’ve ever 
had all come at the same time.” 

According to LaPlante, it is the 
team’s combination of talent and depth 
that helps it excel.

“All of them will impact the team,” 
she said. “There will be fierce com-
petition, which will make it tough 
to determine who will be the top 
eight.”

Despite all the Tritons’ talent, 
UCSD failed to earn a semifinalist 
slot in the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association Western Regional 

that took place in Pomona 
on Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, 
the team’s first action of the 
young season. However, 
LaPlante is not concerned.

“We don’t put a whole lot 
of significance on the tour-
nament,” she said. “No one 

Men’s Golf Lands 10th at Western Washington Invitational

By Matt Croskey
Staff Writer

In its annual rankings of the 
nation’s top 792 golf programs, Golf 
Digest has billed the UCSD men’s 
golf program as the best in Division 
II, and No. 32 across all three col-
legiate divisions.

The rankings were printed in 
Golf Digest’s September issue as 
a guide for aspiring high school 
students. Considered factors were 
whether a team improved or 
declined last season, the previous 
season’s scoring average, percentage 
rate of change, campus academics, 

campus climate and the program’s 
coaches and facilities.

UCSD ranked first in academics 
among D-II schools, first in climate 
among all schools and in the top 10 
percent for coaches and facilities 
among all schools. 

“These rankings mean a lot,” 
junior Nathan Phan said. “It really 
gives us a sense of pride to play for 
UCSD. We still want to play consis-
tently and improve, and the rank-
ings will go up if we do that.”

Entering his 29th season at the 
helm, head coach Mike Wydra has 
seen UCSD’s golf program emerge 
from obscurity to national recogni-
tion. 

“When I was first hired we 
played dual matches against one 
other team,” Wydra said. “As we got 
farther and farther along, we played 
in a few tournaments a year and 
started having post-season success. 
We made the move to Division II 
in 2000 and have made it to the 

NCAA regionals every year since. 
The rankings are based on things 
you can’t control but are a pretty 
good cross section of what makes 
any program good.”

The Triton men are coming off 
a sixth-place finish in last year’s 
NCAA D-II Northwest/West Super 
Regional, where Nathan Phan fin-
ished in ninth place, just missing a 
bid for NCAA Championships as an 
individual.

“I was disappointed, but I wasn’t 
thinking about making it as an indi-
vidual,” Phan said. “I just wanted to 
play solid for the team, and making 
it as an individual would’ve been a 
bonus.” 

Phan is part of a UCSD squad 

that has kept last year’s roster intact. 
He said that the team is better pre-
pared than ever, because the return-
ing juniors are all consistent con-
tributors and drive others to play 
better. With so much returning tal-
ent, it appears the Tritons are poised 
to make a run at the NCAA Team 
Championships in what would be 
their first appearance since 2003-
04.

“It isn’t out of reach,” junior Billy 
Olsen said. “We have a solid team 
coming back and we have the expe-
rience.”

That campaign began Sept. 24 
to Sept. 25 in Bellingham, Wash.,  
where UCSD teed off at the Western 
Washington Invitational at the 

Bellingham Golf and Country Club. 
The 14-team field played two rounds 
Sept. 24 and followed up the 36-hole 
day with a final 18 on Sept. 25.

Juniors Phan, Olsen, Ryan Bailey, 
Noah Moss and freshman Bryan 
Olshock made the plane trip for the 
Tritons. 

“[The Invitational] was weird 
because it happened before school 
started,” Phan said. “We hadn’t had 
any team practices yet so we just 
showed up at the airport and flew to 
Washington. We were a little rusty 
after not playing in tournaments in 
awhile.”

After day one, Phan led UCSD

with a 71-77, four-over total of 148, 
earning him a tie for 22nd in the 
tournament. Bailey supplemented 
Phan with rounds of 74-76 for a 
six-over 150. 

The challenge of collegiate golf is 
that there are two winners: an indi-
vidual and a team. A typical tour-
nament consists 
of 54 holes with 
each team bring-
ing five play-
ers. Each player 
competes indi-
vidually, carding 
his own score. 
The team score 
comprises four 
of the school’s 
top five, ulti-
mately cumu-
lating into one 
total. As always 
is the case in 
golf, the low-
est score wins. 
But the team-
play aspect of 
golf is different 
from any other 
sport, as Wydra 
explains.

“What hap-
pens in many 
other sports is your performance 
depends on how well others around 
you perform,” he said. “In golf, it’s 
such an individual sport that you 
have to play your game as if there 
is no one anywhere near you. It’s 
important if you hear your team-
mates are doing well because it 
boosts you, but if you hear they’re 
doing poorly, you’re an individual so 
it doesn’t make you play poorly.”

Despite the independence of 
each player, the Tritons had a col-
lectively rusty day one: A team total 

of 600 placed the Tritons in 10th 
with some serious play needed to 
catch leader University of British 
Columbia at 556.

UCSD posted a team total 301 in 
the final round, leaving the Tritons 
in the same spot they started at the 
beginning of the day. 

Phan again led the Tritons, card-
ing a two-over 
par 74 for a three-
round total 222 
and a 27th place 
finish. Phan fin-
ished four strokes 
ahead of team-
mate Bailey, who 
shot a closing 
round four-over 
76 for a 226 over-
all.

Olsen finished 
tied for 42nd at 
227, and Moss fin-
ished tied for 59th 
at 234. In his inau-
gural collegiate 
event, Olshock 
placed 50th with 
score of 230.

“It’s really easy 
in golf to get down 
on yourself when 
you’re not playing 
well,” Olsen said. 

“But we have 10 guys on the team 
this year and each one is support-
ing one another and helping each 
other’s swing. We didn’t play that 
great, but it’s still a long season.”

The long season continues as 
UCSD will finish out its fall play 
with two more tournaments. First 
up is the Sonoma State Invitational 
on Oct. 22 and Oct. 23 in Santa 
Rosa, Calif. Then the team will trav-
el to Hawaii to play in the Mauna 
Lani Invitational from Oct. 29 to 
Oct. 30.

is ever playing their best tennis at the 
beginning of the season.”

Part of the reason for the Tritons’ 
struggles was a foot injury Desai suf-
fered just days before the tournament. 
Desai won her first match in the singles 
tournament over Kaitlin Woodridge 
of Cal Poly Pomona, 7-5, 6-2, but 
had to retire in the 16th round. The 
injury ultimately forced her to default 
both her singles and doubles matches. 
Desai’s doubles partner was Dan; the 
duo would have made a run if Desai 
had been healthy.

The women of the tennis team 
will return to the courts for the UC 
Irvine Invitational, set to take place 
on Nov. 10 and Nov. 11. That tour-
nament will conclude the fall season 
for the Triton team; the spring sea-
son starts on Feb. 2 when UCSD hits 
the road to face the Azusa Pacific 
University Cougars, a team that 
defeated the Tritons in the season 
opener last year. UCSD will look 
to avenge that defeat and start its 
season on the right foot this year. 
Alumni Day for both the men’s and 
women’s teams is Oct. 20.
