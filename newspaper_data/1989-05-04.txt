Outgoing A.S. Votes 
Against Representing 
Greeks on Council 
By REBEKAH DENN 
Staff Writer 

The outgoing A.S. Council in 
its final meeting last night voted 
against a proposal to have a non-
voting member of the Greek sys-
tem represented on the A.S. 
Council. 

The proposal was defeated 
despite a vote of nine for and 
eight against, with one absten-
tion; two-thirds approval would 
have been necessary for the pro-
posal to pass. 

The proposal, if approved, 
would have placed a non-voting 
representative subject to approval 
by both the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and Panhellenic Society, on 
the public relations, program-
ming, and finance committees. 

A Greek representative, ac-
cording to the bill's co-sponsor 
John Robison, 1would be] bene-
ficial to the A.S. first, and the 
fraternities second." Interfra-
ternity Council President Curtis 
Bowden suggested, "We don't 
want something from the A.S .. 
We want to open a formal line of 
communication to the A.S." 

Benefits to the A.S., he said, 
would include"a captive audience 
of 1400 people," and the strong 
organization and resources of the 
Greeks. 

An appointee might, Bowden 
felt, help assuage "the misrepre-
sentation of Greeks in campus 
media." The new Council, Bowden 

said, had "made promises to 
Greeks and said they were inter-
ested in more representation ... He 
added that a Greek appointee 
would "demonstrate good faith" 
on the part of the A.S. in making 
good on its promise. 

Opponents of the bill included 
University Center Board Commis-
sioner Evan Weisenfeld, who 
called it "inappropriate ... and 
setting a bad precedent." 

The Greeks are organized and 
numerous, Weisenfeld said, and 
therefore do not need the repre-
sentation. Smaller campus groups, 
he said, such as the Women's 
Resource Center and the Lesbian 
and Gay Organization (LAGO) 
have more need for an A.S. voice. 

Although he is a fraternity 
member, Weisenfeld said that his 
first responsibility is to the under-
graduate population. 
. "There shouJd be a separation 

between government and sociaJ 
functions," Weisenfeld said, 
adding that "I think if we pose this 
to the undergraduate students, 
they'd say no." 

Much of the controversy cen-
tered around the recent appoint-
ment of a non-voting sports rela-
tions director to the Council. This 
set a precedent, Robison said, 
explaining that he would not have 
introduced the bill if the sports 
director had not been appointed. 

"With the exception of the co-
ops," he said that with a Greek 
appointee, the Council would

Animal researchers and animal 
rights supporters at UCLA cont-
inued to grapple with the ethical 
and moral questions raised by 
vivisection during April's World 
Animal Liberation Week. 

While a national animal rights 
group spokesperson said that 
breaking into research labs to free 
animals would be as justified as 
"breaking into Auschwitz to free 
prisoners of war," animal re-
searchers at UCLA insisted that 
vivisection helps both humans and 
animals. 

While animal rights activists 
claim that animals are pointlessly 
mutilated and killed under the 
guise of research, animal re-
searchers say that vast improve-
ments and new discoveries in 
human and animal health are the 
result of animal research and

experimentation. 
Jennifer Buchwald is one of 

nine UCLA researchers singJed 
out by Last Chance for Animals, 
an antivivisection group, for con-
d ucting experiments they consider 
"pointless. " 

Buchwald, UCLA's associate 
director and a professor of 
physiology, conducts neurological 
research which involves exper-
iments on cats. 

She said that animal rights 
groups make emotional rather 
than moral appeals by focusing 
their attention on cats, the most 
readily identified with domestic 
animal. In reality, cats and dogs 
comprise only two percent of the 
animals used in research at 
UCLA, she explained, while the 
rest are largely rodents. 

Furthermore, cats experience 
no pain during the insertion of 
electrodes and wires into the brain 
because the brain has no sensory 

endings, she said. 
The animal rights groups "take 

procedures out of context that 
sound very gruesome, such as 
drilling holes in the head and 
inserting electrodes," Buchwald 
said. "Of course, these same 
procedures are used in human 
neurosurgery. " 

However, UCLA Professor 
Warren Quinn, acting chairperson 
of the philosophy department and 
a specialist in moral philosophy, 
believes that research animals do 
suffer. 

"I don't believe a dog's pain is 
any less than a human being's. I 
don't believe an animal's terror is 
any less than a human being's," 
said Quinn, a self-described ··side-
line participant" in the animal 
rights movement. "I'm very, very 
dubious of the idea of doing evil 
so that good may come of it." 

But Buchwald insisted that by

"Any building," Mclaughlin 
said while looking around the 
spacious store, "particularly one 
on an extraordinarily tight budget 
such as this one, will have 
problems." 

Finding harsh critics of the 
Center only requires a walk 
through its offices where em-
ployees - due to what they de-
scribed as a strong sense that the 
"administration doesn't want 
negative comments about the 
Price Center" - discussed the 
Center's flaws only on the condi-
tion of anonymity. 

Some employees in the Center 
complained of inadequate air cir-
culation in the building which 
they feel may be responsible for 
some workers' reports of head-
aches, burning eyes and exhaus-
tion. 

However, it has not yet been 
determined whether these com-
plaints are related to air circula-
tion problems or other environ-

Some patrons and employees 
at the Price Center - particularly 
the handicapped - have ex-
pressed frustration over the inop-

design of the central program-
ming area. The steps and the loca-
tion of the loading zone make it 
difficult to move heavy equip-
ment, such as speakers and stage 
risers, into the area, according to 
Price Center employees. 

The Center's theater has also 
been the target of criticism. 

The first time a film was being 
shown, according to one source, 
two lights at the back of the 
theater, intended to light up the 
area around the theater's door, 
were so bright that they obstructed 
the projection.

U CSB Academic Senate Passes 
One Course Ethnicity Requirement 

SANTA BARBARA - The UCSB Academic 
Senate Faculty Legislature voted 31-27 on April 27 in 
favor of a one-course general education ethnicity 
requirement with a two-year interim evaluation 
period, but the deci ion may still go to a second vote 
to allow for a mail ballot of the 560 profe sor in the 
College of Lellers and cience. 

The legislature al 0 unanimou Iy approved reduc-
tIon of the current two-course American history and 
in titution requirement to one course. 

The decision of the one-course ethnicity require-
ment came after month of debate on the pros and 
con of a two-course requirement, which was rejected 
by the faculty. Chancellor Barbara Uehling voted for 
the o ne-course requirement but ab tained from voting 
on the two-course question. The legislators' concerns 
with a two-course proposal were attributed to a pro-
jected overload of GE requirements and lack of avail-
able re ources, uch a cia room space, profe sors 
and teaching assistants. 

Antivivisectionists at UCLA Arrested 
During Animal Rights Protest 

LOS ANGELES - Twenty members of the antivi-
visection group Last Chance for Animals (LCA) were 
arrested at UCLA's Murphy Hall April 24 on tres-
passing charges, ending the first day of protests that 
began World Laboratory Animal Liberation Week. 

Two more members were arrested on felony 
charges of assaulting a police officer. 

The protesters refused to leave Chancellor Charles 
Young's office unless he responded to a letter request-
ing that UCLA fire nine researchers for "misusing 
millions of taxpayers' dollars and pointless animal 
experiments. " 

The letter was originally sent to Albert Barber, vice 
chancellor for research programs. 

In a prepared statement, Barber said the demand 
was "totally without merit," and that wUCLA stongly 
supports the work of these prominent researchers." 

The LCA protest, one of the many planned for 
Animal Liberation Week, began at 10 a.m. as about 
130 members gathered near the UCLA Medical Cen-
ter's main entrance . The group carried posters of cats 
allegedly mutilated during experiments and placards 
calling for a halt to animal research .

President Bush Praises Chicano/ 
Latinos During Visit at UCLA 

LOS ANGELES - Traditional Chicano/ Latino 
values such as strong family bonds, discipline, patriot-
ism and love of God will provide a basis for changes 
in society, President George Bush said at UCLA on 
,April 25. 

At a reception including pinatas and a mariachi 
band, Bush spoke to about 300 members of over 20 
Los Angeles Chicano/ Latino business and profes-
sional organizations at the James E. West Center. 

Standing under a banner which bore the words, 
"Bienvenidos President Bush," the President 
explained that, based on his years living in Texas with 
his wife Barbara, and their son's marriage to a Latina, 
"the Hispanic culture is our culture too." 

Before speaking at the reception, President Bush 
mel privately with community leaders, campus offi-
cials and students. 

His speech lasted less than 10 minutes, and received 
mixed reactions from the audience.

placing undue emphasis on animal 
uffering and ignoring the benefits 

of research. animal rights activists 
"don't tell the whole story." 

Animal research is carefully 
screened and monitored by a 
variety of federal , local and pri-
vate agencies designed to protect 
the welfare of the animals, 
Buchwald explained . And re-
sea rchers try to curtail their use of 
animals and gather the largest 
amount of data possible from a 
minimum number of experiments, 
he said . 

Furthel more, animal research, 
particularly the mapping of cat 
brains, has led to health advances 
for humans and animals, Buch-
wald said . 

L-dopa, an effective therapy 
for the previously incurable Park-
inson's disease, and valuable infor-
mation on Alzheimer's Disease, 
have been obtained as a result of 
research done on cats, she said. 

Humans and animals have a 
symbiotic relationship, Buchwald 
said, and benefit from one a-
nother. Animals benefit from 
having been domesticated by 
humans thousands of years ago, 
she said . 

"The cat, the dog, the cow, the 
sheep would not have existed as 
we know them if the human 
species hadn't domesticated 
them," she said. 

In return, the animals yield 
'!Umans the ability to benefit both 
humans and animals through 
animal research. she added . 

Quinn objected to animal re-
searchers' arguments, and said " I 
don't know what the correct 
theory is, but I have very st rong 
moral beliefs that the infliction of 
pain and harm on a defenseless 
creature for the sake of others, 
animals or humans, is very hard 
to justify ... the more deeply you 
look into the question, the harder 
it is to feel happy about what we 
do to animals." 

He added that the same reasons 
used to justify animal research 
can be used to justify medical 
research performed on humans. 

"What the defenders of animal 
research have to show is why 
harm and pain for a chimpanzee 
matters les than harm and pain 
for a retarded human being of an 
equal intelligence level. I don't 
think anyone has ever produced 
that argument. All the arguments 
I've ever heard from the research 
people could be turned very easily 
into an argument for experiments 
on people," Quinn said. 

Buchwald, however, said that 
"there is no reason in the world to 
try [untested medical treatments] 
out on human beings unless they 
had been developed on animals 
first. 

") do have a lot of feeling for

research, through developing mo-

But animal rights activities not 
only challenge the morality of 
animal research, they also ques-
tion the advances that scientists 
say have been brought about by 
it. 

Jack Carone, a spokesperson 
for Last Chance for Animals, said 
that many diseases and epidemics 
'~ust burn themselves out" in-

dependently of medical inter-
vention, and cures discovered 
through animal experimentation 
do not aid in curing or controlling 
many diseases. 

However, animal rights activists 
frequently lack the scientific back-
ground necessary in under-
standing the research, said UCLA 
kinesiology professor and res-
earcher Judith Smith. Smith 
added that no one in Last Chance 
for Animals was "competent 
[enough] to read research re-

ports ... 
Furthermore, animal rights 

activists may cause the animals 
more harm than good by breaking 
into laboratories where research is 
being performed to free the an-
imals," Buchwald said . 

The break-ins are harmful to 
animals, she said . 

"We don't know where the 
kidnapped animals are now. 
During last year's break-in, an-
imals were traumatized by the

Hunter S. Thompson 
A Clean, 111- I~ighted Place 

Editor s note: The folio wing is a .. Best 0/ Hunter " column/rom June 
1986. 

T HE EYES OF the American sex business were focused on Hollywood last week, as industry moguls gathered in the plush gardens and ballrooms of a glass hotel on a hillside overlooking 
Universal Studios for the 10th annual Erotic Film Awards. They came 
from both coasts, in stretch limos and gold lame gowns, to honor the 
best and brightest of their own people. 

The guests arrived discreetly, checking into penthouse-style suites on 
the highest floors of the slick Sheraton-Premier Hotel , with their wives 
and even their children. Many registered under different names, or a 
mix of corporate blinds: A casual observer would have taken them for 
a convention of Chrysler Corp. stockholders. The men wore dinner 
jackets and the women were dressed in silk. . 

No searchlights probed the sky above the hotel , and Robm Leach 
was not invited. 

This was mainly a private affair. It was part of the 18th annual 
convention of the Adult Film Association of America , an old-line 
consortium of pornographic theater owners, a profoundly endangered 
breed. 

These are the people who have long provided the clean, ill-lighted 
places for people like Ricardo Ramirez from Los Angeles, the much-
despised "Night Stalker" suspect, and Albert DiSalvo fro m Bosto.n. 

These are the nation's X-rated theaters, where filthy old men 10 
cheap black raincoats have traditionally hung out - often for weeks 
at a time - between bouts of roaming the streets and preymg on little 
children . 

The guest list was 0 exclusive that even Sean Daniel, president of 
production at Universal, was turned away .... But Larry Flynt was 
there and so was AI Goldstein, the editor of SCREW, from New York. 
Ther; was also Russ Hampshire, president of powerful VCA Studios 
in Hollywood. and the Mitchell Brothers. 

We arrived around noon at the Burbank airport and were whisked 
off in a white Lincoln by a man who spoke no English. On the way to 
the hotel he brushed heavily with a gray BMW, rear-ending it at a 
stoplight on Victory Boulevard in fro nt of the Pierce Brothers Mortu-
ary - but he stomped on the gas and sped away, appearing not to 
notice it. My neck was bashed sideways like the top joint of a rubber 
chicken, causing a whiplash injury that plagued me for the rest of the 
conference. The hotel provided a masseuse and a traction bed , but the 
pain never entirely went away. . 

This was no small event. It was like the legendary Apalachm confer-
ence, except that nobody got seized or busted . There was no public sex, 
and the only violence was a deranged outburst by rookie sex starlet 
Mi y Manners who wore a body stocking all night and screeched 
relentlessly at her patron, Artie Mitchell. She was quickly subdued by 
security specialists . 

A man named Grissim tried to jump off a fifth-floor balcony with a 
bottle of gin, but he was restrained by police, then forced under a cold 
shower in the hospitality lounge . His friends and associates laughed as 
he was taken away in a neck hold . 

T HE BIG WINN ER was film maker Henri Pachard , who won the " Best Pictun;, of the Year" a."'a~d with his. omnibus "Taboo American Style, a heavy faVOrIte 10 the bettmg. 
It won easily, garnering almost as many awards as" ew Wave 

Hookers," a cruel and trendy piece of atavistic film that featured 
addicts hard rockers and other doomed scum from places like Newark 
and the' aband oned piers of Long Beach. It had somethi ng to do with 
" ew Wave Music" and young pimps, but in the end it was m?re like 
"Knott's Landing" or some wretched Portuguese poolroom 10 New 
Bedford, Mass. 

"Ta boo" was not much better. It featured incest, treachery, ruined 
lives and child abuse in a four-part "Dallas"- tyle miniseries that ran 
for six hours . 

These were the big winners for 1985, which was not a good year for 
sex films. T he pendulum has apparently swung back, or at least into 
some kind of lame gray area, from the years in the early '70s that were 
known as "The Golden Age of Porn. " 

That was the time of such breakaway classics as "Deep Throat" and 
"The Story of 0 ." 

Since then budgets have shrunk and cinematic conce pts have with-
ered to the pdint where "Thunderthighs, "and " Backdoor Housewives" 
and "Swedish Children with Animals" have become the bellwethers of 
the industry. 

There was also "Squalor Motel, .... Sperminator .. and " Ken Chan the 
Laundry Man" ... and in San Diego a double bill featuring " Hot 

azis" and "Huge Bras o. 4" ran 155 weeks.

freedom, as he marched on At-
lanta. That is, Lincoln felt up-
staged by General Sherman. 

Third, President Lincoln is on 
record as saying " ... If r could save 
the Union by not freeing the 
slaves, I would do so ... " Lincoln 
was not the magnanimous presi-
dent that the history books would 
have us believe. 

As for the charges of reverse 
discrimination, both students are 
uninformed , biased , and hysteri-
cal in their argument. In order for 
someo ne to discriminate, there 
has to be a base of power. Addi-
tionally, the discriminator must 
have something that other people 
want. 

You would be hard pressed to 
convince me that blacks, Chica-
nos, Native Americans, women, 
persons with disabilities , senior 
citizens, gays/lesbians, the eco-
nomically disadvantaged and 
children have that power. I include 
all those groups because they are 
subject to the whims of white 
heterosexual males. For the pur-
poses of this argument , let's keep 
it confined to UCS D. What is itat 
UCSDthat underrepresented popu-
lations ha ve that is denied to 
whites? 

As Il'ecall, Roger Revelle, John 
Galbraith, Earl Warren, John 
Muir, Jonas Salk, and the list 
goes on and on are white males . Il 
is against University rules and 
regulations to deny a student 
entrance to any organization. 
Whites are invited to participate 
in MeChA, AASU, APSA, and 
any other ethnic/ cultural-based 
organization . Men may join the

Blame the Administrator 
Editor: 

We have been following the 
debate in the Guardian about the 
demonstration at the High Price 
Center and see that it has gotten 
off track. So far the adminstra-
tion - the target of the demon-
stration and the ones responsible 
for the police brutality - has 
escaped blame. 

Police are brutal. They carry 
guns, sticks, mace, a nd they are 
trained to use them . Calling one a 
"bad cop" (John Anderson) and 
the other a "good cop" (David 
Rose) diffuses criticism of the real 
force behind the police. The police 
were just doing their (typically 
brutal) job. 

Our criticism should be directed 
toward the ones who met with the 
police before the demonstration 
and gave them orders to stop 
"dissenters, "the ones who pay the 
police, the ones who sanction any 
brutalities that might occur; the 
power behind the scenes, the ones 
that send the police running to 
crack heads, while sitting back in 
a comfortable chair, in a plus h 
office, and having their secretar-
ies make a quick call. Behind 
every brutal policeman lurks a 
seemingly innocuous, but far more 
sinister bureaucrat, who controls 
and benefits from the actions of 
the police. Richard Atkinson, Joe 
Watson, Tom Tucker, and Jim 

Carruthers all have long records 
of back-stabbing students, but 
that is for another letter ... 

In general terms, the on-going 
conflict between students and 
administrators is easy to under-
stand: administrators try to mold 
students into their image while 
students struggle to define them-
selves . Most students expect to 
leave arbitrary authority behind 
when they come to college, and 
they have a healthy disrespect for 
University bureaucrats. But a few 
students are not so easy to explain. 

Evan Weisenfeld , a student and 
elected leader, seems truly hypo-
critical when he claims that the 
High Price Center gives students 
a "choice." But his statement 
makes sense if you take into 
account how he's been kissing 
Jim Carruthers'ass for two years. 
Evan's position is completely 
consistent with the history of 

' administrative responses to the 
choices that students have made 
about the High Price Center. 

In spring of 1982 over two-
thirds of the students responding 
to the College Review Committee 
que t;onnaire approved of the 
Student Center as is. In spite of 
this choice, in 1983, Joe Watson 
hired Tom Tucker to head the 
adminstration's new University 
Center, and he began illegally

As for the Early Outreach 
Program, disadvantaged whites 
are also embraced by that pro-
gram. There are countless scho-
larships available to white stu-
dents . The Student Affirmative 
Action Program employed a white 
male as a resource intern. 

All of the colleges at UCSD, 
along with the Student Affirma-
tive Act ion Program, have the 
responsibility of promoting di-
versity on campus. It is incum-
bent upon all of us to get the total 
picture and recognize the contri-
butions of all cultures - not j ust 
white males. If you consider the 
definition of culture, what is the 
legacy of white culture in this 
country? I will spare you a treatise 
on that subject. However, I would 
strongly recommend a course in 
ethnic studies for Michael and 
Mark. Shirley Chisholm's presen-
tation would have been beneficial 
also. 

In the interim, I'd be happy to 
fill in the historical / hyste rical 
gaps. As a professional, it is my 
duty to serve all students. I invite 
both Michael a nd Mark to utilize 
the recourses in my office, so that 
they may get an accurate picture 
of affirmative action. The rights 
and privileges that they enjoy are 
not exclusive. They take these 
rights and privileges for granted. 
For underrepresented popula-
tions, it's a matter of survival.

OPINION 

Q and A: 
Do you think U CSD labs should use 
animals as subjects in research? 

Definitely not! Much oj 
the research that is done 
poses unnecessary cruelty 
to the animals. 

Tricia Henry 
Freshperson, Warren 

Communications 

It is necessary to have 
some animal experimenta-
tions to advance science. 
However, the experiments 
should be as humane as 
possible and the animals 
treated with care and respect. 

Chris Woldin 
Freshperson, Warren 

BioPhysics 

I think that animal re-
search would benefit medi-
cal research and enable us 
to cure diseases which ure 
Jatalto human beings. How-
ever. the research should be 
done in moderation and with 
great care. 

Chrissy Abernathy 
Freshperson, Fifth 

Communications 

Animal research should 
be used only when there are 
no viable alternatives and 
then. only if the animals 
involved are treated hu-
manely and are not exposed 
to unnecessary suffering. 

Matt Mendrala 
Senior, Warren 

Cognitive Science 

Animal research is essen-
tial to the advancement oj 
science. Without it. the 
development oj new drugs 
and medical procedures 
would be impossible. Cos-
metic research, however. 
should be ceased.

OPINION 

"Our Genetic 
Advantage" 
Editor: 

This i in response to the two 
white male persons who are dis-
couraged because the University 
community does not care to give 
recognition to white persons. This 
isn't new. In the 1984-85 teacher 
education program, I had a class-
room teacher who was black and 
my assigned 'master teacher' told 
me to my face I had "to deal with 
the nigger and the whitey issue." 
It ultimately led to my dismissal 
from T.E.P. 

Each and every time I have 
made the attempt to charge reverse 
racism, I have been silenced . 
Ultimately I have been silenced 
for something that truly had merit, 
and no one anywhere either had 
the guts or cared to make an issue 
of it. If you feel the administra-
tion is weird about this , it is 
because no one has the political 
guts to make a stand. And that is 
no exaggeration. I know for a fact 
the adminstration is superbly 
weak. 

Perhaps the suggestion is to be 
pointed in your hiring practices 

a nd you r political alliances once 
you get out beyond your college 
day . There is no need to be a 
raci t , however, there is more rea-
son than ever now not to neglect 
the reinforcement of our cultural 
well being and our genetic advan-
tage as this next century quickly 
approaches.

Students Get 
Just Desserts 
Editor: 

Ever since the new Pub has 
opened up there has been a lot of 
flack about how the administra-
tion has stolen the Triton Pub 
from the students. However, it is 
not the administration's fault. Who 
is at fault you ask? It is none other 
than the students of UCSD. 

Who was it that asked for a 
pizza pub to be built last year? 
They asked us what we wanted , 
and we got it. Now you're com-
plaining because it wasn't quite 
what you had in mind . 

By asking for a pizza pub you 
closed the Triton Pub, not just 
because the owners did not want 
to move into the Price Center, but 

a lso because you can only have 
one place on ca mpus that is 
allowed to se ll alcohol. So the 
Triton Pub had to lose its liquor 
license to make way for your 
requested pizza pub. 

You've made your bed , people, 
now sleep in it. You ca n't blame 
the administration for your lack 
of knowledge . No one is going to 
tell you the consequences of your 
actions, you yourself must bear 
the responsibility of the Pub's clo-
sure. Besides, haven't you learned 
yet that you ca n't get something 
for nothing? Now the Pub has 
paid the price for your lack of 
vision. Learn the consequences of 
your actions before it's too late or 
this will keep on happening to 
you in the "real" world.

Continued from pale 4 
campaigning for a referendum to 
make students pay for it. Afteran 
unprecedented five~ay election 
period, only 21 percent of the stu-
dent body voted, and only 54 per-
cent voted for the referendum. 
According to student activity 
procedures, new fees must receive 
67 percent affirmative vote from 
at least 25 percent of the students. 
Even though the referendum failed 
on both accounts, Joe Watson 
declared the referendum "passed." 

Students chose not to spend 
their money on the adminstra-
tion's plan for a High Price Cen-
ter, just as they are now choosing 
to make the co-ops autonomous 
from the University bureaucracy 
under the co-op referendum, and 
choosing to make the High Price 
Center a free speech area, and 
choosing to have a student's pub 
by boycotting Round Table. Our 
choices were, and are being, 
ignored by administrators and 
their lackeys (Weisenfeld), and 
when we try to carry them out 
they are repressed by the police. 
But, the struggle will continue 
until victory! 

P.S. And yes, Evan, we ate 
your cake (one comrade ate four 
pieces and she loved it, another 
stole a bottle of Jack Daniels 
from the VIP reception), and we 
intend to make the most of the 
$9.5 million ($9,500,000), that you 
and the slime that writes your 
resume pay us. But if it were our 
"choice," we would have given the 
money to students organizations 
like the co-ops, the SAAC organ-
izations, the Women's Resource 
Center, or to scholarships for stu-
dents who can't afford shopping 
malls .

COUNCIL: 
Greek Issue 
Discussed 
Continued from pale 1 
Greeks, and that criteria should 
be established for who should 
have ex-officio representation 
before supporting anyone group. 

Robison , however, took a dif-
ferent view. 

"[Greeks are) the only repre-
sentatives seeking to give some-
thing to the A.S ... ' financially 
and in manpower," Robison re-
sponded . 

A .S . President Maynard 
Dimmesdale, another co-sponsor 
of the bill, stressed the difference 
between the sports director and a 
potential Greek appointee. 

The sports director, he said, is 
not for a specific student organi-
zation, but will address the needs 
of all undergraduates in regard 
to sports. 

Dimmesdale co-sponsored the 
bill because he feels that "it's up to 
the Council to decide what kind 
of representation they want." 

An offical Greek representative, 
said Senator Molly McKay, would 
relieve Council members who are 
a lso Greeks of any conflict of 
interest.

Drugs are Dangerous that freeway killing is limited to drunk driving he i sadly mi -
taken; driving under the inOuence 
of drugs i the reason behind 
many fatalities . Maybe he needs 
to spend some time in the emer-
gency room where I work and see 
the kind of damage that people 
like him help create. Maybe he 
needs to have one of his friends be 
a victim one day; that might help

Editor: 

I did not entirely agree with 
everything that Mr. Kelly had to 
say in his letter (Guardian, April 
23) but I was infuriated by Mr. 

ossman' letter (Guardian. 
April 26). 

First, equating trying drugs with 
trying spinach to see "if one likes 
It" has got to be one of the most 
a inine reasons to try drug I have 
ever heard of, the difference being 
that drugs are potentially harm-
ful. Who ever heard of someone 
dying of spinach overdo e? ot 
trying something that is hazard-
ous is an intelligent choice, not 
evidence of somebody being 
closed-minded; jumping off an 
a irplane without a parachute 
would be closed-minded . 

Second , contrary to Mr. 
Cos man's belief, drugs are not 
widely legal and accepted in 
Europe even if such places like 
Amsterdam have slipped into 
depravity; they are the exception 
and not the rule. I grew up in 
Europe and have lived in different 
countries there and I think I know 
a little more a bout it than Mr. 
Cossman, who e erudition about

Re idents of Warren may have 
noticed the appearance of a 
crosswalk at the dangerous inter-
section near t.he Engineering 
Building. This walkway connects 
Warren to the rest of the campus. 
It is extremely dangerous for 
pedestrians and bicyclists, because 
cars seem to think they have the 
right to run people over just 
because there is no crosswalk. I 
have almost been hit on many 
occasions. 

All around us, we see examples 
of the administration assuming 
they have a carte blanche. They 
neglect student safety, dance 
around important i sues, and 
ignore our votes. More money-
generating rules are made (e.g. 
weekend parking fees soon to 
come). Personal rights are vio-
la ted as well; we're not even 
allowed to make noise on Friday 
a nd Saturday nights in our own 
apartments or, God forbid, have 
a few friend over for a beer. We 
can see the social life of this cam-
pus going to hell. We're not treated 
like adult and our homes are no 
longer private. 

Editor: 
David Wolfson's article" tu-

dent Recalls Dartmouth Days" 
(Guardian , April 17) takes unfor-
tunate potshots without sub tan-
tive documentation. For the 
record, for the past two years the 
Career Services Center has con-
ducted a very aggres ive telemar-
keting and direct mail campaign 
to attract employers to it on-
campus interviewing program. 
The results have been substantial : 
a 64 percent increase in employer 
participation. To the best of our 
knowledge, no other Career Cen-
ter - anywhere - can match our 
growth . 

But more importantly, we know 

that on-campus interviewing is 
not the only (or for many, the 
best) way to look for work . That's 
why we also offer these other j ob 
search programs: job Ii tings , 
ME TO R, the Job Search Clu b, 
the Technical Job Fair, and 
Communicationsl Arts Network. 
We don't think any other career 
center offers as much job search 
diversity, either. 

This combination of growth 
and diversity produced a record-
busting 27 percent of the class of 
1988 who found their jobs di-
rectly through the Career Services 
Center.

Director, Career ervices Center 

So now there's a crosswalk. 
The interesting point here is 

that there hould've been a cross-
walk months ago. But, as usual, 
the administration has neglected 
to do something important. Hey, 
if it doesn't have to do with 
re earch, who wants to put money 
into it? 

We've all been waiting around 
for "someone" to do "something" 
about it. That's just the problem 
- apathy. 

So, I did something about it. 
Granted , it's not that big ofa deal , 
but this campus would be better 
all around if more people acted 
instead of sat. 

The administration does have a 
carte blanche, as long as we are as 
apathetic as we've been. As long 
as we don't resist the changes , the 
changes will occur - and they're 
not in our best interest. They're in 
the administration s best interest. 

This is a call for action. This is 
a call for people to a CI instead of 
waiting around for others to. Put 
pressure on those in charge, and 
get the message across that we 
will not sit around while we are 
taken advantage of.

Dale Spender Advocates 'Women-Only Space' 
By THERESA N. DUQUE 
Guordian InTern 

"In a male-dominated society, the dom-
inants don't like the subordinates to get 
together without them," feminist author 
Dale Spender said to a mostly female 
audience during her lecture entitled 
"Women-only Space: A Humanist Ap-
proach." 

A visiting fellow of the University of 
London, Spender has written more than 
15 works, including Women of ·Ideas 
and What Men Have Done to Them. 
Man Made LAnguage. and Mothers of the 
Novel. Her lecture on campus lasl Thurs-
day was sponsored by the Women's 
Resource Center. 

Men's resentment toward women striv-
ing for time to themselves, "women-only 
space," resembles that of "every colonial 
power [that] has passed laws against the 
colonized meeting, " Spender said . 

" Men have [a lot of] men-only space 
available to them ... but they are hostile, 
antagonistic to women doing the arne," 
she said . 

Spender's lecture focused mainly on her 
philosophy of "women-only space," the 
theory that women can e cape their subor-
dinate role by establishing some sort of 
women-only forum to discuss the female's 
identity, culture and reality. Women's "first 
steps to liberation" rely emphatically on 

I"finding a place in which to develop," she 
ladded. 
: This self-development, Spender explain-
,ed, involves strengthening women's role in 
conversation with men, a topic encom-
passed by her research. With recorder in 
hand, she "became the most unethical tape 
recorder [who] taped natural conversa-
tions [of men and women] everywhere." 

According to Spender, her recording 
contained no data on women and men 
talking; instead, "men did most ofthe talk-
ing. Men did nearly all of the interrupting." 

She reported that in the United States 

Dale Spender feels women should "find a 
place to develop." 

and Britain, 98 percent of the taped con-
versations were dominated by men ... 
Furthermore, in Sweden, 99 percent were 
dominated by men. 

"Men define the topics, men determine 
the terms, men define the way in which [the 
topics are] talked about. The most com-
mon statement that men make in conver-
sations with women who they think are 
their peers is a variation of 'What you 
mean is ... '" 

Her findings convinced her to change 
her research topic from "women and men 
talking" to "women and men interacting." 
Spender felt she had toevaluate the signifi-
cance of women listening while men talked; 
or even more disturbing to Spender, situa-
tions where women talked while men did 
not listen. 

UN 0 matter what the topic is that women 
are talking about, men's contributions are 
almost non-sequitor every time," she said. 
During Spender's lectures, "the only ques-
tion that men have asked are, 'How does 
this affect meT I have not, to this day, had 
a question from a man .. . about women's 
experience ... 

During a question-and-answer period, 
one female audience member commented 
that "there were three different times when 
I tried to take photographs of women in 
public places ... and men jumped in the 
picture [each time)." 

"It happens all over," pender replied. 

, All S.dllhl.n! Guardian 

"(Perhaps the photographer] should 
have displayed a 'No Men Allowed' sign," 
countered one of the few men in the 
audience.

Symphony, Reggae, and Fine Arts 

"What you mean is .. . "Spender retorted. 
Spender's studies of women and men's 

interactions led to close analysis of what 
each sex considered a good conversation. 
One study at the Universtiy of London 
asked the male and female participants, 
"Do you think you had a fair share of the 
conversation?" Most of the women said 
"yes," when they had only talked for 15-25 
lpercent of the conversation. Spender said 
women defined a good conversation as 
one where everyone had their turn; where-
as men defined it as one in which' they 
dominated it. 

By MAUREEN SPURR 
Staff Writer 

It has been called a cultural 
wasteland, a place where people's 
cultural interests reach about as 
fa r as buying homes, cars, and 
running shoes. 

A great many feel this way 
about California; that the 'gel-a-
lan mentality' overrules any in-
terests in the art . A number of 
San Diegans are disturbed and 
saddened about the lack of sup-
port for the arts, and the fact that 
a rtists are such a minority. 

One group that would like to 
see this change is called the Ocean 
Beach Arts Council. In celebra-
tion of a prospective change in 
attitude, the First Annual Penin-
sula Arts Fe tival will be launched 
this weekend. 

"We11 have the largest congre-
ga tion of some of the best artist~ 
m the Western U.S. here in San 
Diego," Festival Director Ron 
Ja mes said. "The response has 
been inspiring." 

Among the wide range of events 
and entertainment planned are : 

Saturday 
Time Band 

nearly 100 booths of fine arts and 
crafts, wine tasting , an art 
exhibit of painting and culpture, 
jau bands, the San Diego ym-
phony, the California Ballet, and 
the Starlight Opera . Some well-
known local favorites like the 
Cardiff Reefers, Fattburger, and 
the Mighty Penguins will also 
perform. 

Food booths will offer Ameri-
can and foreign cuisine, ranging 
from light snacks to complete 
meals. Throughout the festival 
area there will be demonstration 
of work in progress and public 
hands-on projects fo r those who 
wish to get involved. Area schools 
and civic groups will also host 
special displays.

"Women get so little opportunity to talk 
in the presence of men that one of the 
reasons we need 'women-only space' is [to 
allow] women to experience talking," 
Spender explained. 

The classroom, according to Spender, 
can provide a critical source of "women-
only space." For example, women's stu-
dies courses have great potential as 
"women-only space." Here, women can 
discuss women's is ues through their female 

ization's major sponsor), money 
generated trom fund ral mgevents, 
and per ona l and business con-

tribution~. No government grants 
or funding have been provided . 

.. After a four-year hiatu from 
community service projecls, my 
inner voice suggested it was time 
to get bu~y again," James said. 
" What fir\1 came to mind was a 
project from years ago that never 
got off the gro und - construc-
tion of an outdoor amphitheater 
nea r Robb Field . 

"To attempt this con~idera ble 
undertakmg, the inner voice and I 
deCided we needed a committee 
and convened a meeting. There, 
the Ocean Beach Arts Cou ncil 
was conceived . The Council de-
cided it needed a major fundrai -
ing event, a nd so the Peninsula 
Arts Fes!i\a l was born ," James 
explained.

The UCSD Guardian 

Feminist 
Speaker 
Continued from page 10 
perspective while reading text or 
fiction written by female authors . 
Anything male-oriented is avoid-
ed . 

Spender's vision of the women's 
studies class takes this premise a 
bit further. 

"[When] men are in women's 
studies, there are topics that are 
not raised and most of the women 
will have in mind the comfort of 
the men throughout the course .... 
That's reprehensible. I've al-
ways wondered what men want to 
do with women's studies. Why 
do they want to jeopardize what 
women are doing?" she queried. 

Preserving one of the few exist-
ing "women-only spaces" means 
establishing women's studies class-
es for women only, Spender said, 
but mentioned no proposals to 
initiate any legislation to ensure 
this. She believes that by taking 
women's studies classes, women 
are trying to find a special niche 
for themselves, freeing them from 
a curriculum that traditionally 
caters to men. 

Because men tend to dominate 
conversation, Spender reasons 
that men will do the same even in 
women's studies classes, thus jeo-
pardizing the women's attempts 
toward any progress in self-aware-
ness. Even if a man does not say 
anything, his presence "makes a 
difference in what women will 
talk about," she said. 

Spender bases her support for 
women-only women's studies 
theory on her research on male-
female interaction in the class-
room. She found that "boys do 
most of the talking and get most 
of the teacher's attention," and 
that the teacher only negotiates 
with the boys, creating a curricu-
lum largely related to males. 

"If the material doesn't make 

FEATURES 
The females start 10 get dis-

tressed because women generally 
tend to "feel responsible for men's 
emotions," she said . To prove 
thi , Spender cited the evidence 
that "the more women moved up 
the career ladder, the more energy 
they had to put in to assure men 
that [women] aren't a threat." 

During her lecture, Spender 
asked the women in the audience 
to examine their own sensitivity 
to men's feelings of distress . 
"When I'm talking, register the 
point at which you start to look 
around, to look at the males to see 
jf they're all right, and if they feel 
uncomfortable ... 

Women's ability to listen, she 
said, ironically reinforces wom-
en's tendency to cater to men's 
emotions . One of Spender's 
experiments involved taping a 
conversation among a group of 
women and another among a 
group of men. In each group, she 
asked one person not to speak. 
She found that the women noticed 
who did not speak and in what 
order everyone else spoke. The 
women concentrated on what 
others said and when they could 
lenter the conversation. Spender 

"The more women moved up the career 
ladder, the more energy they had to put in to 
assure men that [women] aren't a threat. " 

the male experience central, the 
males start to get distressed , the 
females start to get distressed [and 
there is] enormous pressure to 
switch towards the male [exper-
ience]. " 

-Dale Spender 

reported that the men took no 
notice of who did not speak. 

Women's tendency to listen so 
much, she concluded, facilitates 
men's control ofthe conversation, 
concentrating on "topics relating 

to themsel ves rather than equally 
including the women. 

For Spender, this means that 
" men have got an enormous 
amount to know about conver-
sation, about listening .. . Here's 
this enormous skill which [women 
have] developed, and it's being 
ripped off and it's certainly not 
documented, appreciated or re-

PHIL'S ANALYSIS . .. I know, ] know, there are 
II other horses running in Saturday's Kentucky 
Derby, but I really didn 't feel like listing all of them 
- especially with odds that don't really make any 
sense until the day of the race when people place their 
bets. Easy Goer looks like the early favorite, but it 's 
been ages si nce the favorite won the Derby. Houston's 
got a shot at it because Laffit Pincay Jr. is riding and 
he's the only experienced Kentucky Derby jockey of 
the lot, but don't bet on it. It could very well be 
'Sunday Silence by a nose over Awe Inspiring - but 
for place and show. To win? I've got a hunch that 
Clever Trevor, for the simple reason that he's got the 
best name of the bunch, will win this one by a couple 
of lengths. And with these odds, you .can make thou-
sands. Phil advises you to put up $40 to win and ...

up just one hit and struck ou t five 
IT D balters in the 1-0 shutout. 

" I fe lt good out there," Sa a ki 
said . The wi n improved her record 
to 9-1 on the eason. Coach Lisa 
Bassi complimented Sa aki's 
adjustment from last year, when 
the Tritons "relied heavily on her 
and on ly had two p itchers." T his 
year Sasaki has not had the 
opportunity to throw in as many 
games because of the Tritons' 
depth a t pitchi ng, according to 
Bassi. However, lack of action 
has not diminis hed her effective-
ness when she's on the mound . 

Dianna M oreno sta rted the 
second game and pitched fo ur 
innings of shutout ball to capture 
her 12th win of the sea on . S he 
allowed two hits and struck out 
two. Kathy Fogg entered the game 
in the middle of the fo urth a nd 
pitched three more inning of 
shutout ba ll to get t he save. 

"They (US D) gave me my last 
loss," More no expla ined, "so it 
was fun out there." Kathy Fogg 
was "glad to throw," and is look-
ing ahead to Nationa ls. 

The wins capped a tremendous 

season for the Tritons. Again, t he 
effort s of Tracey Ke hr we re 
pheno menal. She went three for 
fi ve wit h an RBI and a stolen 
base. Coach Bass i sa id "she's been 
on fire fo r the last six double-
headers." 

Asked a bout playing defense 
fo r UCS D' pitching taff, Kehr 
said . "It's easy when they're o n, 
and today they were pitch ing 
well ." 

The Tritons have not surren-
dered a run in their last six games, 
a nd Kehr aid , "it's good that 
we're build ing up just in ti me fo r 
Natio nals. " 

Bassi commented that the Trit-
o ns " have said a'll a long that 
[they're] a freight-trai n on the 
way to Nationals. 

Coach Lin Adam , however, 
preferred not to downplay the 
West Regionals, which will be 
UCSD first roadblock before 
Nationals. 

Sunday night the Regional pair-
ings will be a nnounced , a nd there 
isa chance that the Trito ns will be 
the host. 

Tritons Still Win Six of Last Eight

Dianna Moreno pitched a 2-0 
shutout in game two. 

Baseball Falls to usn 7-2 
By JONCARLO MARK 
Staff Writer 

Many fe lt that the UCSD base-
ball team was ·unfairly denied a 
spot in the NCAA Division III Far 
West Regionals last season. This 
year, that should not occur. 

Though the Tritons fell to USD 
o n Tuesday in their last regular 
season contest, they finished the 
season strong and have beaten 
Cal State San Bernardino - the 
other school competing for the 
second spot in the Regional -
three out offour times in head-to-
head competition this year. Cal 
State Stanislaus is virtually as-
sured of the other spot. 

The T ritons are carrying some 
momentum into t he playoffs, 
winning six of their last eight 
games. However, they concluded 
the regular season with a 7-2 loss 
to the Division I USD Toreros. 
The loss should not affect the 
Tritons' playoff chances. Still , six 
of USD's seven runs were un-
earned as the Tritons let the game 
slip away in the seventh when the 
Toreros managed to score four 
unearned runs stemming from a 
botched infield grounder. 

"We handed the game away," 
Triton Head Coach Lyle Yates 
said . " We hit the ball hard and 
were the better club today. yet we 
made some costly errors which 
hurt us." 

At the same time, Yates was 
very satisfied with the pitching 
performances of both Rick R up-
key and Mike Morgan. Although 
Rupkey 's record dropped to 10-4, 
he pitched a strong seven innings 
before j unior Mike Morgan came 
on to finish the game. 

"I'm very happ y with the 
pitching going into the playoffs," 
Yates said . "Rupkey has pitched 
well , J.J . Fisher has come on 
strong with a 7-1 record , and 
Mike Morgan is tough as a starter 
or a re liever. " 

The Tritons were able to pick 
up a run in the second inning 
when Chris Murphy reached first 
o n an error. Murphy advanced to

scored on a single by catcher

The seco nd UCS D run was 
scored in the six th by Anthony

by the USD infield . But the Trit-
ons were unable to capitalize when 
Gary Fessia was caught in a run-
dow n and Jimenez flied out to 
center.

Though he took the loss against USD, Rick Rupkey finished with an 
impressive 10-4 record, 

The team attitude is very pos-
itive and the Tritons are confident 
they can succeed in the post-
season, should they be selected . 
According to Yates, the two-and-
a-half week wait for playoffs to 
start will not affect the players , 
but what may affect the team is 
whether or not it will be selected

Raw Art At Sushi 
by chri.tina huUaI' 

hiatua luff writer 

Once you get pas! the transienrs 
sleeping on the cold, dirty pave-
ment and the dehumanizing glares 
of San Diego's finest, a pllery 
exisrs. The gallery is Sushi, Inc., 
which specializes in performance 
and visual art. For the next month 
Sushi will host irs seventh annual 
Festival of the new arts, Nevfesl. 

The backside of the old, aban· 
doned Carnation building in 
downtown San Diego wu the site 
of the first performance on the 
Neofest agenda, "Woyzeck and 
Maria on East ~." Large studio 
lights stood in place, a woman's 
face was plastered upon the 40 
foot wall by projector, as T.V. 
monitors flashed images before 
our eyes. Silently, we sat waiting. 
All of a sudden a car drove into 
the service yard followed by 

another and another, all honking 
and screaming at one another. 
Obscenities were yelled and phys-
ical gestures responded. The rush 
of excitement sent chills up my 
spine while goose bumps formed 
on my arms and legs. 

The piece continued, utilizing 
many different media : slides, 
video, audio, and live perform-
ance. 

"Woyzeck and Maria on East 
94" by Carla Kirkwood and 
Deborah Small nplored, in an 
odd way, the phenomena of free· 
way shootings and the simmering 
rage that errupts below our surfa-
ces. Driving a car can no longer be 
regarded as a personal and isolated 
activity. Kirkwood, co-author and 
actress, is a critically-acclaimed 
artist and Emmy winner. Small, 
co-author and visual artist, is cur· 
rently the acting assitant direc· 
tor of the Warren College Writ· 
ing Program. 

The first performance on Nevf· 
e!C'S agenda, "Woyzeck and Mria 
on East 94" was a one.night-only 
performance but it paves the way 
for the other upcoming events. 

On May 1,8 &. 15, Neofe!1 will 
bring fonh David Keevil's "Really 
Seeing Bert." Ben, the imaginary 
childhood friend of Keevil, be-
comes the focus of this almost 
entirely audience participation piece. 
Keevil will hand out scripts to the 

audience to be read aloud in uni· 
son, overlapping the interior 
monologues. 

Keevil , a San Diego based per-
formance and visual anist, received 
his MFA at UCSD's Visual Arts 
Department. Keevil is also a lec-
turer in the Muir Writing Program. 

Neofe!c then sways toward the 
comical and absurd realm of per-
formance an with "Rasputin -
The Forbidden Story" by Kaboo-
die. This performance will come 
up with a re-interpretation of the 
Rasputin myth. It will explore our 
reactions to the outsider, the for· 
eigner, the immigrant. 

Kaboodle, an English perfor. 
mance company, will use film noir 
pseudosleuth narration, haunting 
live music and the physical energy 
of the performers. "Rasputin" will 
give irs premiere at Sushi on May 
6 and a second performance on 
May8. 

On May 11-12, Neofe$1 will 
present "Picture Postcard" by Don 
Victor. A solo performance, "Pic-
ture Postcard" follows the main 
character Ray Ferguson, a former 
traveling salesman, whose midlife 
crisis has driven him from the 
highway of security to the eccen-
tric chintukawa highway. 

Along Ray's travels, we meet 
outlandish characters like Leonard, 
the bad musician whose father 
wears hubcaps to bed, Pastor 
Shimke, a perennial tourist and

Haitian Exhibit Colors Lif. 
by eric llI.taflOn 

hiat .. intern 

Haiti. For many, the thought of this country conjures up images of 
hardship, political oppression , and the specter of AIDS. Indeed, (or 
Western eyes, the fact that Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western 
Hemisphere, has an 80 percent illiteracy rate and an unemployment rate 
of 50 percent, makes Haiti a country in distress. 

However valid these statistics may be in assessing the general situa-
tion in Haiti, they belie the cultural wealth that the country holds. 

A glimmer of this Haitian cultural wealth can currently be seen in an 
exhibit entitled, Haiti Bomboche at the Grove Gallery until May 20. 

The translation of this tide, "a Haitian Festival," does much to 
convey the overall impact of this assemblage of original Haitian 
paintings and metal sculptures from the collection of Dr. Robert C. 
Brictson. 

Upon entering the exhibit, one is overwhelmed by the vibrance of 
color that surrounds the viewer. There seems a palpable sense ef 
exuberance filling the air. No sign of melancholy here. 

In paintings like "Aigle Anima" (198.5) by Denis Smith - purples, 
blues, and pinks dance in dynamic symmetry. Although its inhabitants 
may not have a lot of material wealth, they are surrounded by a very 
beautiful land. The paintings in this show reflect the latter seen through 
the lushness and brighmess of its color. 

Yet the wealth of the Haitian culture in this show cannot be judged on 
the vibrancy of its colors alone. Beneath this aesthetic surface of festival

tA Phenomenal Film' 
by phil macgovern 

hiatus writer 

No need for corny introduction or lead-ins, this one is simple: Field of Dreams is a phenomenal movie. It is 
easily the best movie that I have seen this year. I could just end this review there. If you would like to find out 
more about this movie, then read on. 

Field of Dreams stars Kevin Costner, heart-throb of millions and star of reasonable quantity. He does a great 
job (not perfect, mind you. but tbat comes later) playing Ray Kinsella. a '60s burnout who has moved to Iowa 
with his wife Annie (Amy Madigan. also very charming) and hiS daughter Kalin (an adorable Gaby Hoffman) 
to starr farming. 

One day while standing among the corn, he hears a voice, and then sees a vision of a baseball field. Spurred 
by this, he plows under hi crops and builds a beautiful baseball diamond, with the outfield running into the 
corn. 

One night the ghost of " Shoeless" Joe Jackson, one of the infamous 1919 Chicago "Black" Sox players, 
appears, ready to play ball . Soon afterwards. the rest of the team, along with the ghosts of other dead players 
start showing up and they begin playing regular games. And then the fun starts. 

This story is very much a fantasy, and it is advisable to check your belief in reality at the door. It is about a 
simple man follOWing dreams that are tempered with resentment for his father . A divine force rewards Ray 
and does something to quell his bitterness. 

Along the way Ray helps Terence Mann (perfectly played by James Earl Jones), a famous radical writer 
from the '60s and big fan of baseball and Dr. " Moonlight" Graham (Burt Lancaster works his usual magic) a 
kindly (but dead) doctor who had only one appearance (and no at-bats) in the majors. He helps them to fulfill 
their dreams. and only once questions his role. His d reams are the last to be fulfilled, and all his discontent is 
setrled . 

Dance Across U.S. ' 
The acting is tremendous on all accounts, the directing is wonderful and the story is very strong. The effect 

of a player walking into the corn at day's end made my mind spin every time I saw it. The jokes are funny (a 
few hilarious) while the suspense and joy fill your blood with adrenaline. There is nothing that this movie 
does not do to the audience. 

I feel almost blasphemous to mention some skittery photography, because this movie is so good. It is a 
wonderful, wonderful movie. I enjoyed every minute of it and felt sad to see it end, and if you see it, so will 
you.

prose into a nationwide dance 
production. 

What makes United States uni-
que from other dance productions 
is its organizers. United States was 
commissioned by 27 presentors 
in 17 states. This consortium is 
not only commissioning the piece, 
but also serving as a network for 
its performance. United tates is 
already being hailed as a model, an 
answer to the dilemma artists face 
of financing new work and fund-
ing tours. 

Even more interesting than the 
commissioning of this project is 
its content. United Slales travels 
through different regions of the 
country with music. audio tapes 
and dance. 

For example, as United States 
enters the New England section, 
dancers move to excerpts of an 
interview with Robert Frost. 

"Frost was talking about mak-
ing things in ways that were not 
dissimilar to the way I think about 
making things. And the way he 
spoke was astonishingly musical, 
its phrasing hesitations, the way 
his voice would go full speed 
ahead when he was onto some-
thing," Gordon explained. 

San Francisco, New York and 
' Minnesota provide titles for the 
other sections of the piece. The 
New York section includes Ain 
Gordon's account of getting mug-
ged and collapsing in front of an 
absent-minded bank robber who 
stages a hold-up on Columbus 
Day when the banks are closed. 
How much more New York can 
you get? 

Finally, the dancing itself. The 
Pick Up Dance company , a 10-
member group, dances beautifully. 

Valda Setterfield, Gordon's 
wife, opens the Minnesota seg-
ment with graceful movements, 
executing lunges and balance as 
only a experienced dancer can. 
Setterfield dances [0 a tape of her-
self reading another writer's muse 
comparing the differences between 
suburban and rural children. 

In the San Francisco segment, 
Gordon makes fun of not only 
Tony Bennets' "cable car to the 
stars" romanticism but also the 
civic cheer leading that goes along 
with it. The dancing here is clev-
erly choreographed to move with 
the oral text and music. 

David Gordon', Pick Up Dance 
Company will present United Suue5 
on May 5 and 6 at 8 p.m. at Man-
deville Auditorium. Ticket prices 
are $12.

McLachlan's Debut is Sublillle 
by sascha oginz 

hiatus senior staff wri ter 

The voice. powerful yet dreamy, 
surrounds you ethereally, settling 
softly into every crevice of the 
senses. It's a sound not easily 
forgotten, the sublime, melodic 
music of Sarah Mclachlan o n her 
Arista debut album, Touch . 

Born and raised in Halifax, Nova 
Scotia, Mclachlan is only 21 years 
old, but she has a lot of musical 
experience. She has studied clas-
sical piano for eight years and 
classical guitar for 12, in addition 
to five years of vocal coaching. 

"It's a very emotional album 
for me because it's comprised of 
anger, sadness, and happiness. I 
drew from all of my experiences 
so far ," says Mclachlan. "Music 
is an esca pe for me and I think the 
best thing about it is that it can 
touch you in a way that it makes 
you feel something or think about 
something. " 

Sarah Mclachlan 

Haunting, dreamy, and occasionally surreal, countless moods are experienced on Touch . Mclachlan's 
vocal and musical approach has been compared with the work of Kate Bush, Cocteau Twins, and Julia 
Fordham but she says her main inspiration comes from Peter Gabriel whom she calls "a genius, a mentor. He 
does something to me musically that nobody else can. He's like my religion." 

Though Mclachlan's music is not blatantly similar to Gabriel's, it is easy to see the connection in termsof 
intensity and passion. In "Steaming" when she sings 1 was with you on that pallet steaming, Running 'round in 
circles screaming, one senses a building of deep emotion. 

Other songs, such as "Strange World" and "Touch,oo utilized a cool layering of sound. Though the mood is 
rather negative, it seems knowing, painting an aural image of the somber world we live in. 

Prior to Touch, Mclachlan had never written songs. She says, " I see things quite strongly visually 
but I have trouble writing them down and getting the feeling across in words. Music is always a very separate 
entity from the lyrics which I've always had a difficulty with. What I've done so far is try to work on them 
from a visual point of view. I try to create a mood or image with words." 

Not only has Mclachlan created images, but an entire range of feelings. As a whole, Touch is a most 
effective album. If this is a debut, what's next?

roving reporter for Reader's..Dig-

est, and Bernie the dip who 
attempts to get people to fly by 
telling them, "sure it's more 
expensive, death won't come 
cheap." All these characters and 

more will be performed by Don 
Victor. 

"The Disaster Series" by the 
Joe Goode Performance Group 
will give its world premier for 
three nights, May 18, 19, & 20. 
"The Disaster Series" mixes 
absurd comedy and understated 
tragedy to create metaphors for 
personal upheavals which become 

lar~er than life. 

Holly Hughs brings her e"pe~ 
rience as an anorexic, a heterosexual, 
a Jesus freak, a lesbian, and a 
Burger King clerk together to 
explain her relationship with her 
mother and her own sexuality in 
"World without End." This new 
monologue has been called part 
liturgy and part nouveau feminist 
pornography. " World without 
End" will be presented May 25~27. 

Th.. last performance in the 
Neofest Festival is "An Amnesia & 
Other Works," by the Stephan 
Petronio Company. The seven 
member ensemble will explore 
how we touch, grasp, grope, clasp, 
hence help and communicate with 
our hands. The choreography in 
this work encapsulates the noisy 
and often violent sensory over~ 
load of contemporary life. "An 
Amnesia & Other Works" will be 
performed June 2 & 3. 

With the opening of the Neofest 
Festival with "Woyze k and Maria 
on East 94" to the closing per~ 
formance, "An Amne ia & Other 
Works, " Sushi has lined up seven 
wonderful pieces to be performed 
throughout the month. If Satur~ 
day night's performance was any 
indication of what lies ahead, 
Neofest promises to bring forth the 
absolute finest and most incredi~ 
ble of performances. 

All dates will be performed at 
ushi Gallery on 8th Ave. in 

downtown San Diego, except for 
"An Amnesia & Other Works" 
which will be performed at the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art. General tickets can be pur~ 
chased from $1 ()"11. For further 
information you can call Sushi,

Haiti 
Continued from pale 3 
lies in a deeper reflection of artists' 
society. 

A powerful example of this is 
seen in "Two Priests" (1951) by 
Wilmino Domando. This paint~ 
ing dramatizes the confrontation 
between the two dominant forms 
of religion in Haiti: Catholicism 
and Voodoo. Although the two 
religions formally coexist (as of 
1986, Voodoo because an offi~ 
cially sanctioned state religion), 
their ideas and world vision con~ 
flict. 

This is seen as two priests 'face 
off' in the center of the painting 
with the icons of their beliefs 
standing behind in support. Yet 
the confrontation is unbalanced, 
for the Catholic priest is supported 

not only by religious icons, but 
also by the law in the form of a 
poli e officer. The implied perse~ 
cution of Voodoo is felt in the 
pose of a Voodoo priestess as she 
over her face in anguish. 

Numerous paintings and sculp-
tures reflect a 'Mother Nature' 
figure. In "Eraulie de La Mer" 
( 1985) by Prosper Pierre Louis, 
the painting emanates life from 
the spirit of the central woman 
figure in the form of flowing 
colors. In "La Maitresse Angoue 
et Sirene" (1951) by Prefete Duf~ 
faut, Mother Nature ascends from 
the sea with Voodoo symbols 
floating beneath her. This theme is 
continued in Andre Dimanche's 
metal sculpture, "Damballah Vir~ 
gin" (1971). 

The mythology of the fecundity 
of the earth also reflects the con~ 
nectedness with which Haitians 
view their relation to nature, for 
they are still for the most part a 
subsistence society. 

This subsistence is shown in 
"Marche" (1974) by Benjamin 
Canton. Canton depicts a scene of 
everyday life in Haiti with fruit 
collectors attempting to sell their 
goods as fellow workers continue 
to pick in the background. What 
would se~m like an ordinary scene 
takes on life through the use of

A very curious piece entitled 
"Marche~Mange" (1981) by Cas~ 
imir Laurent points to the diver~ 
isty of this exhibit. Although most 
of the artists in Haiti are not for~ 
mally trained and are reffered to as 
"naive" artists, this painting ex~ 
hibits a taste of the western art 
world. The artist uses abstract pat~ 
terning to turn a street scene into a 
very modern exercise in art. 

Overall, Haiti Bamboche is a 
strong testament to the cultural 
wealth of a country sometimes 
overlooked in the face of its social 
crisis. 

'Mats 
Continued from page 1 
trademark Replacements format. 

As with most of their albums, 
Don't Tell A 5{Jul contains several 
loud house~shakers, a soft Wes~ 
terberg ballad and a collection of 
jovial sing~alongs. Of the album's 
loud nature, which Westerberg 
claims to have written for Tommy, 
"Anywhere's Better Than Here" 
and "I Won't" are easily two of 
the best songs ever performed by 
the 'Mats. Both stir up memories 
of Tim 's "Bastards of Young" and 
Pleased To Meet Me's "Alex 
Children. " 

On almost every Replacements 
album, there is one song where 
Westerberg steps out alone with 
only his acoustic guitar and his 
scruffy voice. On Don't Tell A 
Soul Westerberg adds an airy key~ 
board and an extra over~dubbed 
guitar, producing the painfully 
autobiographical "Rock 'n Roll 
Ghost." Wester burg admitted in 
the Musician article that nearly 
every time he plays it, he breaks 
down. 

The rest of Don't Tell A Soul is 
equally riveting. The catchy sin~ 
gle, "I'll Be You" and the anthem~ 
like "We'll Inherit The Earth" 
both make the statement that The 
Replacements have not lost their 
touch in making great music with 
a gritty edge. 

When The Replacements take 
the stage tonight at the California 
Theatre, there will be many not in 
attendance who claim that the 
band has lost it. But it is they who 
will be missing out, for as long as 
The Replacements continue to 
play, they'll reign in a class by 
themselve . The Repla em nts are 
truly the best ro k and r 11 band 
of the '80s.
