New Police Approved 
Another Blow to Bid to Restore Bus Cuts 

By Kathy Huffer 
Sal .. S&aff WrUer 

The San Diego Transit Corp. 
suffered another blow last night 
in a City Council decision to 
allocate $3 million toward the 
city'. police force, 

In a SIX to three vote, the fuJI 
Council approved the hiring of 
100 additional members to the 
city's police force, destroying 
the hopes of those who sought 
the allocation of funds for the 
transit system and other public 
ervices. 
Adrienne Weissmann, a 

ucsb tudent' and Hason to 
mayor Pete Wilson, spoke 
against the measure in a public 

hearing held prior to the vote. 
Describing the effects of bus 

cuts for students as " devas-
tating," Weissmann urged the 
Council to re-examine their 
funding priorities and to defeat 
the proposed increase of police 
officers. 

Last month, bus route 2( 
services were eliminated, 
affecting student rider in the 
Mira Mesa/UCSD/Del Mar 
area. 

Weissmann told the Council 
that cuts have caused a "great 
increa e" in stud ent hitch-
hiking which, she a erted, 
promotes an increa e in crime.

Program for Older 
Students Developed

"Out of sync" student will have an opportunity to meet and 
discuss their particular needs at a reception being held tomorrow 
afternoon. 

According to Beryl Brown, Tutorial Coordinator for OASIS, the 
reception will give older students a chance to learn of ava ilable 
services on campus and to meet one another. 

"They really feel very isolated here ," Brown sald ofthe student 
he described as " more than four years out of sync with the year 

they are in school." 
Brown noted that older students at UCSD " feel like they're the 

only (me" on campus and " need a centralized place" to meet. 
As a result, a coordinated effort by the four college' and OASIS 

was made to bring older students together in an informal euing. 
The Asst. Dean from each college will be pre ent at th e reception 

a long with everal college Program Board member ,a cording to 
Brown. 

Students will break into college group to discuss "what they'd 
like to have" with their particular Asst. Dean, she aid. and will 
consider the possibility of establishing an older tudents' 
organization. Such an organization , she added, would be formed 
only if enough students showed intere t. 

Brown estimated that there are hundred of "out of ync" 
tudents at UCSD. She noted that they "nre not as Identifiable" a 

younger students and face special problems becau e of th ir agf'. 
" They don 't make full use of the service here." Brown 

remarked. " They come and go to cia s and then leav ." 
A former "re-entry" tudent will giv a briefpr s ntation at th 

wine and cheese r ception, said Brown. to relate h r e peri nee 
as an older student. 

Although invitations wer sent to many old I' tudent. 
incomplete lists resulted in overlooking oth I' • accordi ng to 
Brown. She stres d that all are welcome to attend the I' 'C ption. 

The gathering will be held in the International ('ntt'r from

problems in the la t two 
months because of a contract 
dispute between union 

. members a nd company 
officials. 

Compounded with the effect 
«Proposition 13 and a strai ned 
budget, the tran it company 
chose to eliminate everal bu 
routes, including route 21. and 
to curtail the service of several 
other bus lines . 

The Council's propo al to 
increase pOlice ervice drew 
angry response from ome 
members of the community. 
who claimed that the funds 
could be better u ed to re cue 
the cut bu route . 

Mayor Pete Wil on upported 
the budget increase for police 
because of hi belief that the 
additiona l officers will increa e 
arrests and reduce crime inSan 
Diego. 

" No one should be under the 
delusion 'that it (funding) wiil 
automatically reduce crime." 
W il on remarked at the 
hearing. "But in the long run, 
think it wilL" 

Wilson added that "it i 
unfortunate that ome suf:~r

CEP Votes to 
Retain, Refine 
Cole Program 

By John Hondro 
A ociate News Editor 

After a three-yea r-long 
review . which at ti me 
threatened the existence of the 
Communication program . 
the Academic Senate 's 
Committee on Educational 
Policy voted ye terday to 
retain the Communication 
major at CSD. 

Communications Program 
Coordinator Michael Cole 
composed the program 
revision which. according to 
CEP Chair Thoma Bond. 
turned Communications into a 
" more defined major." 

Linda Sabo, CEP student 
repre ntative . aid that 
committee members were too 
concerned with "whether or not 
Communications was a valid 
discipline, rather than if the 
program was academically 
sound and workable." Sabo 
added that ., ome ( EP 
member) think the major is 
till too broad. " 
According to Bond. there wa 

a lot of concern among 
committee memb rs that the 
. progra m rests on th ree 

faculty members.. . there are 
too many ommunication 
tudent for that number of 

facult ." 
Cole. who' arrived at C D 

from Ro 'kefeller niver ity 
thi year. commented that the 

ommunications program 
"will need coop ration from the 
other departments ." He 
believes II more faculty 
member become involv d in 
the program. it will be " in good 
shape." 

On the oth r hctnd , Com-
munication will not be able to 
ucceed "without interdi -

ciplinary upport a nd involve-
ment. " aid Bond. " Making 
(the ommunication pro-
gram) a department would 
de troy the interdi ciplinary 
focu ." explained Bond. "But if 
people in the interdisciplinary 
departments don ' t have 
re pect for the program. it will 
hurt it. " 

According to Bond. the CEP 
pas d the revi d program 
with certain limitations. The 
revised major will include a lot 
of new cour ,he aid. ' 'The 
CEP mu t approve eery 
cour e ... we approved th plan 
without approving it · ingre-
dient ... new cour e will have 
to go through the regular 
r vipw proces ." 

Bond aid that c ro 
cour es 10 th major "mu t 
prove relative to the di iplin 
of Communications." 

nother limitation i ' that 
only two media production 
cours can count toward the 
major . according to Bond.

Voluntary Fee Brings 
$8,000 to CalPIRG 

By J ocelyn Larkin 
Staff Writer 

CalPIRG received approx-
imately $8000 from a UCSD 
voluntary fee program 
initiated tbis quarter . 
according to Fritz Fitzgerald, 
UCSD accountant. 

When students registered 
this quarter, they were given 
the . option of supporting 
CalPIRG (California Public 
Intt-rest Research Group) with 
a 52 fee , which David Harris, 
new student directo r of 
CaIPIRG. estimated about 400/0 
of the student body chose to do. 
Tbe voluntary fee program was 
authorized by students in a 
referendum held here last 
spring. 

CaIPIRG, a student-run 
organization, researches social 
and consumer problems on 
campus and in the community. 

In past year , CalPIRG was 
supported by funds allocated 
from the student government, 
a i till the ca at San Diego 
State, but in order to run a 
qualified re earch organization 
the group felt th y needed a 
constant ource of funding , 
according to Harri . "We f I 
the way w do it now i th be t 
ior tudents. Th can decid at 

registration if they want to 
support the programs," he 
said , adding that if the 
voluntary program had not 
generated adequate funding, 
CalPIRG would have gone to 
the AS for money. 

Harris cited his main goal for 
CalPIRG is to make students 
aware that the research they do 
can and does have an impact on 
social issues. One example of 
this was a succesful reform of 
the misuse of federal fund 
provided to hospitals for health 
care services for the underpri-
vileged under the Hill-Burton 
Act. 

CalPIRG is currently 
involved in the tatewide 
organization of a boycott of 
Coor beer on univer ity

Day Care 
eferendum 

Next W~dneaday aDd Thursday, the general student 
population will intervene in the tumultuous Day Care 
fundine controversy. 

Students will have a chance to register their opinion about 
who should use the campus Day Care Center, and how much 
in registration fee funding should go to that Center. The 
referendum is one of the most technically complex issues 
students will ever face in a ballot box; also one of the most 
emotional. A year and a half of funding battles, rallies, 
arrests and campaigning are part of the referendum'S 
history. 

Naturally, we have recommendations for you. They are: 
"B" (present level of funding) on question one; 
Abstain oQ question two; 
"No" to faculty and staff children in the Center on 

question three. 
• • • 

The current Day Care Center, housed in a ramshackle 
building on the Warren Campus, is in poor physical shape, 
but we don't think it should receive any more funding from 
registration fees than it does now, It can accomodate only 34 
children on a full time basis. There is a campus demand for 
a much larger facility (there are 76 children on the Center's 
waiting list, most of whom will have to wait six months to a 
year to get in the Center, if they get in at all.) The children 
that are in the Center receive excellent care and 
instruction, but we see no reason to upgrade services for the 
children there now unless the number of children affected 
by the Center's services increases. As long as the Center 
remains in its current plant, we support funding at the 
current level, but no more . 

While the present Center is obviously rnadequate, 
referendum question two, asking how much funding should 
go to a new Center, should one be built, is a mistake. 

Before deciding on any level of funding, students need to 
know what a new Center would be capable of doing, how 
many students it could serve and what the. effect of 
increased Day Care funding would be on other registration 
fee funded programs, all topics not adequately dealt with in 
the voter information packet. Therefore, we recommend 
that you abstain from voting on question two. 

The only traditionally constructed question on the ballot 
is question three. With the limited capacity of the present 
Center, we feel that a "No" vote is in order on three. Spaces 
in the Center should go where the most acute need. exists, 
i.e., with the students . The Center's purpose is to open the 
university to students who, because they are parents, might 
not otherwise be a ble to attend the University of California . 

• • • 
The election is formally described as "advisory" to the 

Registration Fee committee, but the political implications 
of defying a student vote will probably be too serious to 
allow the committee to consider diverging from " student 
opinion." We therefore urge all students to carefully 
consider the referendum questions, then vote. Both this 
referendum and the election process in general will be 
discredited on this campus if special interest groups 
dominate and determine the course of the election.

Opinion 
Anti-Day Care Pamphlet 
'Vicious' and 'Distorted' 

Editor: 
We've all seen vicious and 

distorted political propaganda, 
but the red, white and black 
sheet of paper alleging . 
"secrets," and claiming 
"day care is unfair" takes the 
cake. Whoever wrote this had 
ample opportunity and notice 
(through many Guardian 
articles, etc.) to participate in 
the unbiased Day Care 
Information Board hearings 
and to get their opinions in the 
Voter Information Pamphlet 
(which contains two "con" 
arguments, appearing before 
the "pro") . Yet they waited till 
the pamphlet was out to throw 
·their mud. 

They have a right to theif 
ignorance, but they should he 
held accountable for their 
distorted, fragmentary, out-of-
context and sometimes just 
plain wrong " facts. " 

For those who are interested, 
here are accurate figures to go 
with the flyer 's "secrets" and 
"questions: " 

The cost per child at UCSD's 
Day Care Center, according to 
the Reg Fee comm'ittee, is 
$3,286 per child per year. The 
average cost per San Diego 
public center, according to the 
Child Care Information 
Network of San Diego, in a 
report prepared for Supervisor 
Jim Bates, was $3,120-$3,720 in 
1977. Inflation of 10% or more 
would drive this figure higher; 
also, those centers do not 
provide the more costly infant 
care needed at UCSD. 

Reg Fees this year provided 
23 % of the Center's budget. The 
rest came from CETA, last 
year's surplus, the State 
Department of Education 
(SDE) and from parents- in 
proportion tot . ~i r abilitytopay 
as assessed by the SDE. 

Reg Fees this year provided 
abput $25,000 to the Center 
(next year's request is lower, 
about $18,000) . This was about 
84¢ per student, per term, out of 
a tOLal fee of $241 ($125 of which 
are Reg Fees, designated for 
student services) . 

93 percent of the Day Care 
budget this year went for 
salaries. .A UC systemwide 
survey shows this to be ·wlthin 
the norm. According to UC's 
Childcare consultant, around 90 
percent of all daycare center's 
budgets go for salaries, 
regardless of the type of 
service. UCSD's center has 
very little to spend on 
anything else. This year, 
parents took over lunch 
preperation and grounds-

keeping to bring down costs. 
Teachers at the center make 
about as much as a UCSD 
secretary; aids are paid as 
clerks. 

Please do not rely on vicious 
attack like those in the red, 
white and black flyer. Please 
read the unbiased voter 
information pamphlet. Much 
objective work by fellow 
students went into it. 

Michael B. Berger 

Day Care Center 
Spends too Much, 
Hides Budget Figures 

Editor: 
The percentages appear 

innocuous enough and the issue 
seems relatively simple. After 
all, Day Care is a worthwhile 
venture and deserves a chunk 
of the Reg Fee budget. Right? 

Decide for yourself. The Day 
Care supporters are recom-
mending that we increase the 
subsidy to $126,000. That's more 
than twice the amount going to 
Revelle, Muir and Third 
College dorms combined! In 
the jargon of the pro-Day Care 
people, this is called "flex-
ibility." 

Salaries consume $92,000, or 
93% of the current Day Care 
budget. This makes the cost per 
child at UCSD's Day Care 
Center double the average cost 
of quality centers locally, 
according to Childcare 
Information Network of San 
Diego. Extravagent? You be 
the judge. 

One thing is certain. No one 
associated with the Center is in 
any rush to enlighten us with 
the facts . Parents pay only 10% 
of Day Care costs, while the 
other 90% comes from state and 
federal agencies and of course, 
your Reg Fee. Ten thousand 

students, many of whom work 
10 to 20 hours a week to met 
their own educational and 
living expenses, are being 
asked to subsidize a day care 
center which can accomodate 
only 34 children. Subsidize, that 
is, to the tune of $84,000. . 

Some questions are in order. 
What were the findings of the 
audit performed last spring 
which resulted in the dismissal 
of the Day Care Center 
director? Why are Center 
personnel fanatical about 
maintaining the shroud of 
secrecy that up to now has kept 
budget figures from creeping to 
the debate of the issues? 

What is needed is a forum in 
which both sides may debate 
the issue for the benefit of an 
informed electorate. If Day 
Care supporters - are truly 
convinced that social respon-
sibilities demand decent day 
care (at any cost!), then let· 
their spokesperson participate 
in a debate with a represen-
tative of the Justice in Spending 
Committee this Monday at a 
mutually agreed upon time.

Open Letter to Saxon: Why DC Nukes? 
Think About 'National Security' Value of Weapons of Destruction in UC Labs 

President Saxon, 
Last Wednesday, there was a public 

disc ussion concerning the U .C. 
Weapons Labs, at which you stated 
that; " the ONLY reason for U.C.'s 
invo lvement , was ; " national 
security", I would therefore think 
that, at leEst the questioning of the 
definition oj "hat " is in the interest of 
national sec'I rity" is crucial to the 
conclusion concerning this Uni-
versity's i volvement , or non-
involvemel1t in weapons design and 
production. Ilwever. I clissapointedly 
noted no qu stioning by you as to; 
" wha& exa(tl was in the best interest 
of national curity". I was, in fact , 
alarmed by what seemed to be a 
general at>se.ce of scrutiny and desire 
to investlg'lte. 

approximately 50 , 000 present 
warheads to 0 warheads , by building 
more! There seems to be a great deal 
about the Labs, and national security 
policies, which is either unknown or 
unknowable by the top administrators 
of this University. Yet, have you or the 
Regents seriously looked into the 
question of "what is in the bes tinte rest 
of the nation (?) or, what is the proper 
role of the University (?) and how 
much pressure do the leaders of the 
Labs exert on shaping the policies of 
.. national interest" ? 

affirmation and support of weapons 
production sounds more like " mine is 
not to question why , mine is but to do or 
die". It seems that the " I'm just 
following orders" rationale is totally 
incompatable with the nature of an 
independent public institution of 
education. Especially given that these 
products are those which kill mass 
quantities of life. This isn' t the 
endorsement of toothpaste or virus 
research, or even agribusiness 
mechanization. These are clean cut 
creations of "modes of mass death. " 
And, not only are these strategies of 
death devised, they ar,e "sold" to those 
who will authorize their production. 
Our own "Profel8or Cohen" not only 
thought up the neutron bomb but 
pushed it to WashIngton and lobbyed 
for its acceptance. 

in such a way as to encourage their 
own use . They blur the distinction to 
the point that they are (amazingly) 
termed "clean" weapons, despite the 
fact that they are indeed radioactive, 
and furthermore, that they impllcitly 
value materials bver life . Dr . 
Schwartz only describes what our 
University is already responsible for 
creating. 

This bomb designed to painfully kill 
only humans and other life, yet, to 
leave the buildings unharmed, was not 
only designed by, but actively "sold" 
to the Defense Department, by staff 
members of this very University -
this Institution or "truth, social 
awarenesa and knowled,e" (?) 

. You continued, saying that you 
would rather not "see any weapons 
built, and that the one and only reason 
that the University is supporting their 
production is that it is in the best 
Interest or the nation" . Although I 
think that you are quite sincere in your 
repugnance of nuclear weapons, it is 
puzzling as to how we could get from 

T!'e"Question as to our involvement 
is not so simple as to be asked in one 
sentence; "is this in the national 
interest", nor answered by a simple; 
"yes", which originates in 
Washington, D.C., Los Alamos or 
Livermore. 

You are the President of an 
Institution which is said to stand for 
the open discussion of ideas, the 
growth of social awareness, and the 
prinCiples of both, freedom and 
responsibility, to question, (i.e . " Let

justification for the University' 

On Wednesday, you said that Dr. 
Schwartz' theory that: nuclear arms

distinction between conventional and 
nuclear weapons. Yet, what do you 
uppose the neutron bomb, (in fact. 

not In theory) , does? They are devised 

It is quite incon,ruoua, and in fact 
repulsive, to me that; any and all 
nuclear weapOns which would be used 
by this country - and used in a 
genocidal fasbion - do, in fact have 
upon them the "seal of creation and

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The 
1978 California Legislature was 
one of the most conservative of .. 
this decade. but it was slightly 
more liberal than the 1977 
version, a liberal political 
group said yesterday . 

The Americans for Demo-
cratic Action also labeled Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr. "Typhoid-
Jerry" for his support of a 
constitutional convention to 
force a balanced federal budget 
a nd said Brown's fiscal 
conservatism amounted to an 
"Inhuman Deal," 

Khomeini Rules; 
Disorder Persists 

The ADA said that on the 
average last year legislators 
took liberal positions 54 percent 
of the time in key floor votes. 
That compares with a 50 
percent average in 19n. 58 
percent in 1976 and 64 percent in 
1975. 

Democrats averaged 68 
percent, while Republicans had 
21 percent. The highest 
Democratic average in this 
decade was 84 percent in 1973. 
Republicans recorded a high of 
36 in 1972. 

Individual ratings [or 1978 
were based on 15 votes in the 
Assembly and 18 in the Senate. 
Included were measures to 
protect prime agricultural 
land , restrict court-ordered 
school integration and exempt 
the Sundesert nuclear power 
plant from the nuclear 
moratorium. 

Absences counted as wrong 
votes. 

Seven Assembly Democrats 
received perfect scores of 100, 
meaning they voted the way the 
ADA wanted on all counted 
votes. 

They are Richard Alatorre, 
Howard Berman, Teresa

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -
Iran's revolutionary leaders 
turned to liberal, Western-
oriented politicians Tuesday to 
bring order to their country and 
pave the way for Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic 
republic. But lynchings were 
reported in 'the provinces and 
mysterious gunmen [ired on the 
Tehran offices of the new prime 
minister. 

The newspaper Ettelaal 
reported six people had been 
hanged in the northwest city of 
Tabriz on the orders of religious 
leaders. The newspaper also 
said insurgents ripped the 
emblem off the U.S. Consulate 
in Tabriz. 

The reports could not be 
confirmed here but, if true, 
may signal that the new 
government still lacks total 
control. It has repeatedly 
called on jubilant Iranians not 
to resort to " cruelty" in the 
wake of victory. 

There were no new reports of 
violence or arrests involving 
Americans in Iran . A 
contingent of 69 U.S. Marines 
was reported standing by in the 
Azore Islands in the Atlantic in 
case Marines guarding the U.S. 
Embassy needed reinforce-
ment. Six helicopters that could 
be used to evacuate threatened 
Americans were standing by in 
Italy.

whaling commission Dec. 29 
a nd that Chile and Peru will

The president said that, in 
light of these actions, "trade

12-year-old Fisherman's 
Protective Act. 

A spokesman for the Whale 
Protection Fund, one of the 
conservationist groups fighting 
to reduce whaling, expressed 
skepticism about the motives o[ 
the three nations in joining the

whether they would remain in

SCURI Offers Student 
Research Grants to $300 

By Tobias Raymond 
Through the Student Center 

for Undergraduate Research 
and Innovation (SCURI). 
undergraduate students can 
obtain grants of up to $300 for 
academic research projects as 
well as information concerning 
sources of off-campus and 
faculty funding and involve-
ment, 

Founded in Fall 1978 by a 
group of students headed by 
Bob Rubinyi , SCURJ operates 
with an annual budget of 
$10,000. Funding is provided by 
the Chancellor's Advisory 
Committee for Instructional 
Improvement Programs and 
ASUCSD. 

Since the beginning of the fall 
quarter , SCU RI has awarded 24 
grants, totaling $7500. Among 

the projects which have 
I'eceived funding are severul 
documentary films. 

According to staff member 
Joe Franke, SCURI was 
modeled after programs 
initiated at UC Davis and 
Massachusetts Inslilute of 
Technology. Citing the MIT 
program, called Under-
graduate Research Oppor-
tunities Program (UROP), 
Franke indicated more than 50 
pe rcent of MIT undergradua tes 
engage in projects which are 
funded by UROP. 

a directory listing are'ls 01 
research in which faculty 
members are involved. 

To apply for a grant. students 
must complete a SCURI mini-
grant application. Applications 
are reviewed by the Grant 
Review committee for final 
approval. 

Consisting of five students 
and four faculty members, the 
Grant Review committee 
meets during the third and 
eighth week of eacti quarter. 
The final application date for 
the winter quarter is Monday, 
Fe brua ry 26. 

One project already funded is 
Jim Boyce's "16mm Children's 
Film, " which deals with 
childhood fantasy . The film 
narrative is centered about a 
child who seeks to escape into 

, various fantasy worlds.

Projects must be of an 
academic nature, have the 
sponsorship of a UCSD faculty 
member and be a student-
generated idea. The maximum 
grant awarded to an individual 
student is $300, while group 
projects may be funded for a 
maximum of $400. 

Due to the rather limited Grants are not limited to 
budget, SCURI recommends films, as several scientific

Men's Discussion Group 
Forms; Not 'Psychotherapy' 

By Sam Gooch 
A newly formed men ' s 

discussion group, which is 
attempting to provide an 
informal but confidential 
atmosphere for male UCSD 
students wllo wish to air their 
feelings on men's societal roles, 
is off to a slow but successful 
start. Ken Morgen, who started 
the group at the beginning of 
winter quarter, says the 
membership now numbers 
" bet ween 5 and 10 students." 

The discussion group is not 
therapy oriented : it ' s an 
awa'reness group. Morgen 
explained , " I don ' t do 
psychotherapy. I call myself a 
facilitator rather than a leader: 
I don't decide what is to be 
discussed. I'm a member of the 
group too." he added, ''I'm 
very pleased with the way it's 
turned out. " 

The nature of the discussion 
group is reflected by the 
participants, who Morgen 
described as " healthy, sound, 
successful in their lives pretty 
much - not people who need 
psychological help, but people 

who want to enrich their lives." 
Frequently discussed topics 

during group meetings include 
aspects oC male/female 
relationships, parental 
relationships and adult 
independence, male/male 
friendship and intimacy, and 
homophobia - the fear oC being 
thought homosexual because of 
a close relationship with a 
male. 

While Morgen emphasized 
the importance of men's 
relationships with women, he 
also emphasized that "men 
have many common ex-
periences that they don't have 
in common with women." 
Morgen explained that the 
group "promotes a sense of 
belonging, of caring, a sense oC 
reward from a 'no-bullshit' 
relationship , People are 
rewarded by the honesty that 
this kind of group allows for." 

Morgen, who is serving a one-
year internship at UCSD, has 

p~lrticipated in and has lead 
men's discussion groups 
regularly from 1973 to 1976. he 
described his first exposure to a 

men's group as "a very special 
intimacy- a kind of close 
fruternal experience." He says 
that "in many ways that first 
group resembles ' the UCSD 
group: we were all educated, 
motivated, verbal - we were 
able to speak a common 
lanlluar.e. " 

Cole 
Program 
Approved 
(CO ............... el) 
However, credit in these media 
courses "can be used by those 
with a special emphasis in 
media ." 

"The CEP doesn't want this 
to become a technical 
production-oriented school, 
students can go to San Diego 
State if they want that," said 
Bond, adding "UCSD focuses 
more on theory." 

Sabo said that Communi-
cations will have the same 
academic status as the other 
academically approved majors 
on campus, "Once you 've got 
academic approval , you've got 
the same grounds to fight for 
funds as anyone else: if you 
don't (have CEP approval) , it's 
second-class citizenship." 

Bond said the Communi-
cation /Vi ual Arts major was 
not approved by the committee, 
because the plans are "still up 
in the air." 

The CEP serves as an 
ad isory committee to the 
AcademiC Senate - not to the 

hancellor, a incorrectly 
reported in Thfo Guardian last 
week.

Two Get Athlete 
Of Month Honors 

by Karen Hunter 
Sport. Editor 

Men's varsity basketball and 
women's swimming were the 
sports represented by Jan-
uary's athletes of the month, 
Lee Brockett and Shawn 
Blaisdell. 

• Brockett

rebounder on the 1978-79 men's 
varsity basketball squad , 
Brockett is currently fifth in the 
district in field goal percentage 
and seventh in rebounding.

According to Coach Barry 
Cunningham, " Lee displays 
team leadership by the 
example he sets while outon the 
court," Cunningham said that 
he would place Brockett as a 
forward in the all-time UCSD 
basketball team. 

Brockett scored a game high

(Please turn to page 6) 

By Jon Halperin 
In a game that was much 

closer than the score indicates, 
Coach Vince Askey and the 1979 
baseball squad proved to the 
team's younger players that 
UCSD can hold their own with 
major college competition, 
despite a 9-1 loss last Thursday 
to USD. 

Choosing to rotate his 
pitchers freely - five of thesix 
possible starters were used in 
the contest - Askey 's team was 
only down 2-1 after seven 
innings with the highly ranked 
Toreros. The USD hitters 
finally got untracked in the 
eighth inning (or six runs to put 
the game out o( reach. 

The Tritons got off to an early 
lead as Mark Sharpe led off the 
bottom of the first with a long 
double to center. he eventua 

scored on a sharp ground ball 
hit by designated hitter Eric 
Zimmer. 

UCSD bats went into 
hibernation, however, as USD 
pitchers kept the Tritons at bay 
for the rest of the game. Except 
for a sixth inning shot off the bat 
of catcher Jim Moffit that hit 
the foul line in a cloud of chalk 
dust and was somehow 
subsequently called foul by the 
head umpire, the Tritons could 
not generate any more offense. 

Triton Pitchers Look Strong 
Ace pitcher Steve'Robertson 

started for the Tritons and 
fared well in his three inning 
stint. He was hit hard, but some 
fancy glove-work by John 
Dickenson in right field kept the 
Toreros from doing any

Stewart. " Our girls in singles

Volleyballers Drop 3-1 
Decision to Pomona 

The men's volleyball team 
came close to winning last 
Friday night in Pomona, but 
couldn't quite stop the taller Cal 
Poly team and wound up losing, 
3·1. 

" It was by far the best we've 
played so far this season," 
remarked coach Doug Dan-

n~vik . "We served well but just 
could not effectively stop their 
middle attack at all." 

The Tritons dropped the first 
game of the match. 15-5, and 
came back to win the second, 
15-17. The UCSD squad couldn't 
hang on. though, and dropped 
the last two by close margins, 
15-13 and 15-12, 

"Hal Jacobs passed and hit 
super well for us," Dannevik 

praised, "The setting of John 
Lee and Steve Upp was our 
other strong point of the 
match." 
The two teams will face each 
other again later in the season 
on the Triton's home court, 
which, according to Dannevik, 
should "definitely" give the 
home team an edge, 

" I really feel that we ha ve the

points apiece after splitting the 
six singles matches, It was up 
to the three Triton duos to come 
up with the winning touch, and 
they did.

Ruggers Win,14-0 of Month 
Not many teams are able to 

shut out a team from UCLA, 
especially from a non-scholar-
ship, low bud,et intercollegiate 
athletic program. 

Nonetheless, a powerful 
UCSD forward line was too 
much for the UCLA Women's 
rugby team, as the Triton 
ruggers ran over the Bruins 
last Saturday, 14"(), It was the 
first time in five years that a 
UCSD Women 's rugby team 
has overcome UCLA, 

" Our forward completely 
outplayed UCLA," commented 
coach Dave Phillipson, "We 
have a young team, but we' re 
doing super." 

The ucccssful four point 

tries of Cheryl Wright, Ruth 
McCart)' and Francine Brown 
supplied the SCOI'eI for UCSD, 
Wright also added the Idca to 
bring the total score to 14, 

Beth Kaml, AUaou Towle 
and Robin DeVito were also 
cited by Phillipson for their 
aggressive play, 

UCLA was previously 
unbeated and at the top of their 
league standing until Satur-
day 's romp with the Tritons, 

Kelly Texeira, along with 
Connie Parker and Julie 
Lineberger. were also 
instrumental in leading the

Dann, "That's a school and

Dann also commended 
Blaisdell on her ability to "rally

Arts 
Ronnie Laws Overwhelmed at the Fox 

By Guy Messenger 
Thursday evening saw an 

expectant crowd of jazz and 
soul fans filling the Fox 
Theatre in downtown San 
Diego, most of those concert. 
goers anxious to hear 

Ronnie Laws do his 

thing. We heard Ronnie ... that 
is, from time to time. The 
band. consisting of drums. 
congas, two guitars, bass. 
organ, piano, two female 
background vocalists and Laws 
on tenor and soprano sax, 
cluttered the air nearly as 

badly as th'ey did the small 
stage with their high voltage 
fusion tactics. All of the 
musicians seemed to avoid any 
dynamic variation in solo or 
accompaniment. 

The opening tune set a mood 
of tense us well u~ 

oppressive loudness, leaving 
nowhere to go in terms of 
building or working to higher 
levels in either area. What's 
more, Laws' sidemen were all 
gruduates of the " 'ook what] 
cun do" school of music: play· 
ing u loudly and as furiously as 
possible from open to close of 
every tune. This sort of 
accompaniment muddled the 
canvas far too much to 
compliment any of Laws' solos, 
which fluctuated between 
inaudible and feedback ridden. 

Of Laws ' accompanying 
players, the bass player and 
conga man deserve mention-
the former playing a plucky 
sounding Alimbic bass out of 
which he coaxed some funky 
underw a ter-soundi ng licks , 
and the percussionist , 
appearing to know his 
instruments well even though 
they simply could not be heard. 

Law~' drummer was tight, 
indeed. but have you ever heard 
John Bonham playa ballad? 

Ronnie's best showing came 
when be (alone) blew some 
racy, boppish riffs on soprano 
sax. Playing alone brought 
some real soul out of Laws, and 
any reedmen in the house were 
certainly floored. Alas, the 
magic could only melt when the 
band thundered back under the 
soloist to create a fresh "audio 
blur." 

The Fox Theatre crowd was 
anything but warm to Ronnie 
and crew. Minimal applause 
was hard during Dr after 
numbers, and few seemed 
anxious to "put your hands 

Day Care 
RelerendulD 
Voter Inlormation 
PalDphlet 

together now" for Laws. As a 
matter of fact , the Fox began to 
regurgitate many of its patrons 
out onto sixth street well before 
the close of the first and only 
set. 

Tower of Power's Lenny 
Williams preceded Laws with 
an enjoyable set of funk/soul 
offerings. Williams . an 
excellent soul vocalist, won the 
hearts of the listeners by 
stepping down to the theatre 
floor and allowing eager fans to 
sing an improv chorus with the 
rest of the band.

Participation Rock? 

'Santana' Show is 
Colorful, and 
Quite Competent 

By David Rowe 
At times, rock music has the 

power to lift audiences and 
carry them away to back places 
deep within their indiVIdual 
minds. oCten calling back long-
forgotten experiences. Robert 
Hilburn dubbed this phenome-
non .. active rock." where the 
listener becomes actively 
involved with the music. 

This is precisely what 
happened Ftiday ni"ht during 
Santana's performance at the 
Sports Arena. With flames of 
vibrant red, yellow and orange ' 
projected behind the band and 
the congas roaring. one half-
expected to see an Aztec priest . 
materialize on stage. rip out the 
heart oC a sacrificial virgin and 
throw her down the steps of the 
Pyramid of the Sun. 

This Latin motiC was 
controlled in a way only San-
tana' would attempt. With tbe 
percussionists atop a brightly 
colored platform. the rest oCthe 
band situated uniformly below. 
the scene was reminiscent of 

Ricky Ricardo and his band 
performing at the Tropicana. 
filling the room with Uvely 
Latin rhythms. Although 
Tropicana is a far cry from the 
Sports Arena, I'm sure 
Santana's pro(essional manner 
would fit easily into such an 
atmosphere. 

Santana's performances of 
"Well Alright" and "Opl'n 
Invitation." two songs frolll 
their most recent albun· .. 
proved more palatable th: . 
their studio versions had been. 

Eq ually as enjoyable was the 
performance o( Carlos 
Santana , impressive as 
guitarist as well as band leader. 
During the performance of 
"Ain't Got Nobody To Depend

The only piece in this Latin-
rock jigsaw puzzle that didn 't 
quite seem to Cit was lead signer 
Greg Walker. Though an 
accomplished vocalist within 
his limited range. his 'soulful' 
execution of the Santana 
repertoire seemed incongruous 
though unobtrusive. 

In spite of this one negligible 
flaw. Santana was very good, 
as one might expect of a band of 
their calibre.

Science 
uc Plans 10M Scope 

. 

Burbidge Says City Light in Bay Area Obscure 
View; Scope Would be the Largest in the World 

by DouICua ..... 
SdeItee E4IMr 

Scientists from four of the 
nine University of CaUlomia 
campuses are currently 
working to design and 
construct the world's largest 
optical telescope. 

Astronomers fron Berkeley, 
Los Angeles, San Diego and 
Santa Cruz campuses- the 
four campuses with major 
astronomy programs- will use 
the new device to study certain 
pulsars, neutron stars and 
other astronomical phenomena 
too faint to be observed 
acurately with less sensitive 
equipment. 

Plans for the telescope set the 
diameter of the mirror at 10 
meters (about 400 incbes)-
twice tbe size of the instrument 
at the Mount Palomar 
Observatory and almost ten 
feet larger than the 240 inch 
telescope belonging to the 
Soviet Union. currently the 
largest such telescope in the 
world. 

"It might not be possible to go 
that large. " according to 
Professor Margaret Burbidge, 
astronomer with the UC San 
Diego department of Physics 
and member of the telescope 
planning committee. She 
a dded. "We migbt go 
somewhat intermediate. say 
300 incbes." 

At present.tbe largest 

telescope owned by UC is a 
three meter device at the 
university's Lick Observatory 
near Berkeley. 

Burbidge explained that the 
necessity for a new instrument 
has been developing for several 
years. She said that she and her 
colleagues ., have been 
increasingly bothered by the 
Ughts in the Bay Area .. . 
(which) make it· hard to do 
faint-object astronomy." 

The telescope will be 
designed (or use in observing 
light sources whicb emit 
radiation in ultraviolet. visible 
and infrared frequencies . 
Referring to infrared as· 
tronomy in particular , 
Burbidge noted. " There's an 
awful lot of exciting science 
coming out of that." 

One difficulty in studying the 
lower-energy infrared rays is 
that they tend to be absorbed. 
reflected and refracted by 
substances in the atmosphere 
before they reach the 
observatory on the earth 's 
surface. For this reason, the 
telescope committee is 
examining locations which 
would place the apparatus 
above much of the water and 
carbon monoxide (two 
interfering materials) in the 
air. 

"Years ago." according to 
Burbidge. the scientists chose 
Junipero Serra Mountain south 

o( San Jose as a desirable site 
for a new observatory. She said 
that " the University of 
California would like the 
telescope to be in California." 
out added, "maybe we shall 
have to look elsewhere," 
because of the trend of rapid 
development oCland in the state 
and the increasing amount of 
pollution. 

There is not yet a projected 
date of completion ror the 
telescope because , said 
Burbidge . " We 're in the 
planning stages," and there is 
no firm budgetary com-
mitment from either the 
university or the National 
Science Foundation. 

When the instrument is 
constructed. however. it will 
complement the observations 
from the Kuiper Airborne 
Observatory. a NASA plane 
which carries a telescope to 
heights of about 40,000 feet, and 
the Space Telescope. which will 
be launched in 1984. 

. Technological developments 
smee the construction of the 
Soviet and Palomar telescopes 
may allow the UC scientists to 
make the 400-inch mirror much 
lighter than previously 
possible. 

One suggestion was to 
construct the reflecting surface 
using. many smaller mirror 
segments.

u D's JaCoby to Run for Council 
By M, I Payton 

8laif "ricer 
A UCSD E1reployee will run 

for a vacant Del Mar City 
Council Po 'it in a special 
election March 6. 

Pat JaCob.v . Director of 
Public Informati.:m for the 
UCSD Medical School, will vie 
for the one-year term. 

The special election is being 
held because one of the five 
members of the Del Mar City 
Council resigned and the 
remaining members can't 
agree on who to appoint to the 
office. Thus it came to a split 
decision between Pat JaCoby 

and Gordon Denyes for whut 
would be u one-yeur term. 

"The reason I'm running," 
said JaCoby. "is that I really 
care about Del Mur und 
preserving the quulity of life 
here - we don 't wunt it to 
become .mother La Jolla or 
Solana Beach. We wunt to 
p-reserve the village atmos-
phere. 

Being elected to this post 
would notaUectJaCoby'sjob at 
UCSD . The Del Mar City 
Council meets twice monthly at 
night and is strictly voluntary. 

According to JaCoby, she 
represents the residents of Del 

Saxon, Look Into 
What Nukes Do 
(Continued from page 2) 
the total creation of weapons 
will not cease, they at least 
could no longer be legitimized 
by our support. There are more 
pressing and appropriate 
nuclear questions then, "how to 
kill the most people, quickly 
and more accurately" . You and 
the University have the ability 
to use a major institution to 
make the statement: "No more 
bombs, no more violence, not 
with our consent!" It may not 
quickly "change the world'·, 
but one must always remember 
that those who refuse to oppose 
that which they know is wrong, 
do in fact support it , and must 
take . responsibility for its 

existence. I am not willing to be 
a part of the production of 
"varieties of tools of mass 
death". 

I hope that your expression of 
" uneasiness" over our 
involvement leads you to at 
least extensively question both 
the pu rpose and function of 
these Labs . Question whether 
they are necessary for the 
country - and whether they 
are appropriate to our 
University's goals. I urge you to 
.. get out" , but the least you can, 
and should do, is " look in ' ·.

'Amigos' Program Ties 
US,Aid to Latin America 

By Alison Hall 
The Amigos de las Americas 

project is offering students the 
opportunity to participate in 
cross cultural medical and 
dental work in Latin America . 
Open to all students, the project 
involves a month-long stay in a 
city in Latin America 
administering vaccines and 
perfonning dental hYleine and 
education. Some smaller 
efforts at nutritional studies, 
wel1-digging and opthalmic 
care are also being considered. 

Dave Baker, a Muir junior, is 
going to work with AmiIOS 
again this Summer, after his 
trip to Paraguay .last Summer. 
"It is for people interested in 
medicine, not just medical 
school," he says of the 
experience. 

Two terms, from mid-.June to 
mid-July, and from mid-.July to 
mid-August, are available to 
students for their stay in Latin 
America. UsuaUy, a student 
stays in one city, trave))jng to 
outlying areas by foot or 
horseback. One may not choose 
a location , and several 
countries, including Colombia, 
Brazil and Nicaragua, are not 
included in Amigos because of 
disease or political factors . 

Classes have begun at 
Alvarado Hospital on Wednes-
day nights to tutor students in 
Spanish and vaccination 
procedures, and prepare 
students for the cultural 
influences they may encounter 
during the month in a foreign 
country . it is not imperative 

that one be fluent in Spanish, 
Balter says, only that one have 
had some previous experience 
with it. 

The Alvarado meetin&s wi11 
continue until the first term 
begins. 

Students wiu be workilll with 
a student partner and under the 
supervilioo of a field scout, who 
is to deUver suppUes and make 
prior arrangments and 
population counts, Balter says. 
As Amlgos, the partners wort 
with the local or national 
medics of the area. They may 
be required to walk out several 
.miles each day to an outlyng 
district of a city to administer 
vaccinations, and typically 
work with the poorest or sickest 
in the area, Baker adds. 

The Latin govenunents 
consider the Amigos visiting 
dignitaries, Balter says, and 
arrange that they may see the 
nicer areas of the country 
during the last few days of the 
student term. 

Most students in the Amigos 
project, which numbers around 
600 nationwide, are high school 
students. Colleges are not well 
represented because they have 
trouble attaining the necessary 
funding, Baker says. As most 
fundraising mast be done on 
weekends, he feels many 
college students are not 
inclined to give up their time. 
he adds that they are more 
likely to drop out of the 
program than their younger 
counterparts, leaving the rest 
of the chapter paying for 

expense incurred by the 
commitment. 

One must demonstrate both 
monetary and personal 
commitment to be in the 
Amigos project . A $500 
participation fee must be paid 
in four monthly installments, 
and $1,100 more is derived from 
a variety of fundraising 
methods_ The total amount is 
used to defray the cost of 
supplies as weU as air fare, food 
and bouslot. Once one pays the 
total lee, there are no expenaea 
incurred by the program, save 
miscellaneous gifts or personal 
items. 

A disco dance and walk-a-
thon are two planned fund-
raisers for this year's AmigOi. 
Other tactics have included 
appeals to friends of the family, • 
local businesses and churches. 
For several yean, Amigos 
tried to compete with large 
charities for business and 
govenunent aid, but It was 
beyond the capabilities of the 
"grass roots organization," 
says Lee Methias, last year's 
Amigos President. He added 
that in the late '60's and early 
'70's, drug companies could 
donate supplies to Amigos, but 
because of a revision in the tax 
laws, this is no longer possible. 

Amigos is a totally indepen-
dent organization, based in 
Houston, Texas, and is 
supported by monies from 
student participants. It has 
forty U.S. chapters.

Women 's Center has begun a 
series of Re-entry Women's 
Workshops and ·an older 
women 's support group has 
been organized by the 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services . 

According to Brown , "most 
people who return to college 
fulltime are women'" She 
estimated that there are three 
to four time the number of 
older women to older men . 

The reception , however, is 
open to both men nnd women. 

Brown described the re-entry 
students as "incredibly diverse 
people" and said that they 
'· have a marvelou Iy unique

Despite the many difficulties 
that older students face at

refresh •• nfs The Politjournal, a UCSD 
annual publication dedicated to 
providing a scholarly forum for 
undergraduate research 
papers, is struggling this year 
to upgrade its literary product. 

The journal, which publishes 
students' papers from all fields 
in the humanities and the social 
sciences, was first printed in 
the spring of 1975 -a result of the 
efforts by a students' political 
science organization . Ac-
cording to Margot Tempereau, 
business manager and an 
editor of the publication, it's 
been an uphill battle for 
improvement ever since. 
Tempereau cites inadequate 
funding, outnumbered produc-
tion workers, and lack of 
student submissions as 
problems that might prevent 
the Politjoumal from meeting 
this year's hoped for stand-
ards of excellence. 

The greatest obstacle that the 
Politjournal must overcome is 
that so far there have not been 
enough student research 
papers submitted to bring 
about the desired literary 
impact. Said Tempereau, 
"People have a fear that their 
own papers aren't good enough 
- that there will be too much 
competition from other people 
submitting better papers . 
Then, of course, the problem is 
that no one submits papers." 

Tempereau also dispelled 

rumors that the Politjournal 
might not go to press this year. 
Tempereau speculated that the 
rumors may have been fostered 
by the deletion of weekly staff 
meetings usually held this time 
of year. 

According to Tempereau, the 
meetin-gs were dropped 
because she and other staff 
members viewed them as " too 
much wasted energy." In place 
of the meetings, the Polit-
journal staff are concentrating 
their energies in other areas 
where they perceive more 
efficient returns such as 
promotion of the Politjournal 
among faculty members , 
advertising to help increase 
student awareness of the 

journal, and fund raising 
activities. 

Tempereau explained the 
philosophy behind the journal: 
"The Politjournal should be 
more than just a forum for 
publishing researh papers - it 
should be a motivation to help 
improve the quality of 
undergraduate education." 

Tempereau encourages any 
undergraduate student who 
feels they have a quality 
reseach paper for submission 
to contact her at her office in 
the Associated Students' offices 
(extension 4450) . She also urges 
anyone who would like to work 
as a volunteer on the production 
staff to contact her. 

Sun Shines on Sailors 
The UCSD sailing team is 

almost assured of a spot in the 
southern California elimina-
tions after last weekend's 
successful performance in the 
Newport Beach Regatta. 

Competing in Series No, l and 
2, UCSD's boat number one 
sailed to second place out of 
fifteen schools on Saturday and 
first out of fifteen Sunday, the 
best showing ever by a UCSD 
crew. 

Mark Folkman skippered 
and Sue Johnson crewed in 
Division A both days. In the 

Division B boat, Dave Stong 
was the skipper and Karen 
Butler crew. 

" We're pretty happy about 
our showing in the new boats," 
commented sailor/coach 
Folkman. The coach ack-
nowledged that this prac-
tically assures the Tritons of a 
position in the prestigious 
southern California elimina-
tions. 

Series No. 3 and 4 of the 
eliminations will be held during 
March on the home waters of 
Mission Bay,
