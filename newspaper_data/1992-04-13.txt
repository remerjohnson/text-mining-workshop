Tucker Dismisses All 
Charges Against WRC 
• Women's Center did not pay 
to clean graffiti, member says 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Senior Staff Writer 

Charges brought against the Women' 
Resource Center (WRC) Tuesday were 
dropped Friday moming, according to a 
memo written by Ass istant V ice Chan-
cellor Tom Tucker to WRC members. 

Political Science Professor Peter I rons 
spoke to Tucker Thursday as volunteer 
legal counsel for the WRC. 

"I told [the administmtion] they had 
no legal authority. To proceed wi th the 
charge . they would have to provide evi-
dence and witnesses and have a full-scale 
hearing," Iron said in an interview Fri-
day. 

"We pretty much knew that would 
happen," said WRC member Debi James, 
a Muir College senior. 

The two separate complaint . which 
dealt with incident which oc urred dur-
ing the WRC' Mar. 5 "Take Back the 
Night March," concemed spmy-painting 
in the Price Center and female students 
baring their breast . 

A student filed complaint. against the 
WRC under two ~pamte sections of the 
Student Conduct Code, Section 38.15.A.3, 
which addresses damage to university 
property, and Section 38. 15.A.8, deal ing 
with disorderly or lewd conduct on uni-
versi ty property . 

In the memo, Tucker stated that the 
first charge was dismissed because Price 

Assistant Vice Chancellor Tom Tucker 
Center staffsaid the WRC paid Ihec1ean-
up 0 IS. which he considered to be a fair 
re. olut ion. 

James maintains that the WRCdid not 
pay any clean-up costs. 

"There's no way we would pay to 
era eourown voiCe!>. That 's ridiculous:' 
James said. 

When asked about the source of funds 
for the cleanup, Tucker said he was pro-
ceeding on infonnation obtained from 
the Price Center Business Office and as 
far as he knew. the WRC had paid for it. 

Tucker's memo stated the second 
charge was dropped because the inci-
dents of exposure in the Price Center 
were pontaneous decisions by individu-
als and not planned by the WRC.

UCLA Work-5tudy Program Ends 
Due to Increased Needs, Low Funds 

UCLA students looking for work-study jobs to supple-
ment their income this quarter found themselves out of 
luck. Due to a lack of funding, the UCLA Financial Aid 
Officehasremovedalilistingsfromthejobboard.according 
to UCLA Financial Aid Director I....arry Bun. 

Work- tudy is a program that puts students in jobs 
applicable to their educational or professional goal . 

"What it really bums down to i that there is more need 
on campu than we have funds for," Burt said. 

UCLA students already in the program did not lose their 
jobs. but students between orwithout jobs will not receive 
new jobs. 

While these jobs will be available again next year, an 
increased student need for money has exhausted the 
available funds for the re t of the year, Burt said. 

Responding to the announcement. student leaders ex-
pressed theirdisappoinrrnent. " I guess this is symptomatic 
of financial aid everywhere," said Karla Zombro, a UCLA 
student who has lobbied to reform the work-study option 
and make it available to more students. 

"Students will definitely be affected negatively," 
Zombro added. 

Work-study serves a dual purpose because it provides 
students with needed cash as well as valuable experience, 
like career and research opportunities, Zombro said Of-
ten, work-study jobs are belterthan regular jobs, she noted.

Evidence QuestionsSupemova Theory 
By Karen Cheng 
Guardian Reporter 

A study involving a bunch of 
balloons and air samples now brings 
into que tion lhe theory Ihat our 
solar system was fonned as the re-
sult of a star going supemova. 

Profe r Mark Thiemen of the 
UCSD Chemistry Department has 
been studying the re ults taken from 
balloons flown almost fony kilo-
meters into the stmtosphere to re-
trieve atmospheric amples of oxy-
gen. The airsamples. when tested in 
the labomtory. re ulted in the same 
ratios of oxygen isotopes as those 
originally found in the "Rosetta 
Stone" meteorite. 

The study of oxygen isotope in 
the meteorite. which was found in 
northern Mexico, and the isotope . 
subsequent reactions twenty years 
ago set the precedent for the super-
nova creation theory. 

Scientist concluded thatthedis-
tribution of isotopes found in the 
meteorite, which at the time were 
considered highly unusual . could 
only be caused by some kind of 
nuclear reaction. such as an explod-
ing star, which would consequently 
blast pure oxygen gas into the atmo-
sphere. 

From his recent studi es. 
Thiemens has concluded that the 
"funny distribution" of oxygen iso-
topes in the Rosetta Stone L not 
unique; the same reactions that oc-

curred 4.5 billion years ago are just 
as common now. and therefore could 
not have caused the formation of 
our solar system. 

Thiemens made a repon on his 
findings to the American Chemical 
Society last Monday in San Fmn-
cisco. "1 received a lot of good re-
sponse and positive feedback." he 
said. "The atmospheric chemists are 
really interested. and so are the me-
teorite people. Even the astrophysi-
ci ts." 

Thiemens noted that he did not 
receive any negative comments on 
his work. "Well. no one argued with 
me about it. We really have no ac-
cepted proof, but we cenainly have 
strong evidence. Nothing so far say s 
we're wrong. but then the nuclear 
model has a lot of questions that 
haven 't been answered. In order to 
prove something that happened 
nearly 4.5 billion years ago, you 

'haveto build your theory overtime." 
Thiemens said. 

Presently. Theimens and agroup 
of researchers are still doing testing 
with balloons. In order to reach 
heights of over 40 kilometers, how-
ever, they may have to use rockets 
to retrieve data. Data is being taken 
from the stratosphere over different. 
areas of the world, including Texas, 
Sweden and pansofTndiaandSouth 
America. 

Not only does thi s new evidence 
bring into question the supernova 

Professor Mark Thiemens 
theory, but it also provides both 
valuable information to scientists 
about how the stmto pheric ozone 
processes have evolved and changed 
over time and an understanding of 
the diminishing ozone layer and its 
effects on global wam,ing. accord-
ing to Thiemens. He sees it as a 
scientific and a social cOlllribution, 
informing people of what is hap-
pening to their environment today 
and what will happen in the fUiure. 

" It's fun to be able to use what 
you're doing as a living to have 
some positive [effect on] the envi-
ronment, because there's a lot of 
problems, and for an individual it's 
kind of hard to do anything other 
than what a concerned citizen does 
in tcnns of recycling, carpool ing .... 
I'm happy that the [research] 1 doas 
a living can be used [for] a positive 
impact." Thiemens added. 

UC Riverside Chancellor Dies of Stroke 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Associate News Editor 

UC Riverside Chancellor Ro~e­
mary SJ. SchrJerdied Friday after-
noon after suffering a stroke 
Wednesday morning. 

Schraer, 67, was taken off life-
support system at 3 p.m. Friday. 
She had been in a coma at Riverside 
Community Hospital since 7 a.m. 
Wednesday, when she was found in 
her car just after experiencing a se-
vere stroke. 

Schraer, a biochemist, has been 
chancellorofUCRsince 1987. when 
she and UC Santa Barbara Chancel-
lor Barbara S. Uehling were named 
the first women chancellors in the 
UC system. She was set to retire on 
July I of this year. 

One hour after Schraer's death. 
her son, David Schraer, made the 
announcement to the general cam-
pus at a brief gathering while 
Schraer's husband of almost 40 
years, Harold Schraer, stood by. All 
campus facilities shut down while 

400 faculty. staff and studellls con-
vened at the campus bell tower. 

David Schraer held a yellow bal-
loon in one hand while he told the 
gathering. "My mother, my father 's 
wife, the grandmother of my two 
children and the chancellor of this 
campus is now a spirit, and like this 
balloon will become freer still." 

He released the balloon and con-
tinued, "She would want you to 
continue having vision, to look up-
ward and forward. She had incred-
ible faith in people. She believed a 
group could accomplish anything." 

The relatively small UCR cam-
pus, with only 8,000 undergradu-
ates, received the news of SchrJer's 
death with surprise and grief. Be-
fore the stroke, Schraer had been 
said to be very healthy. 

UC President David Gardner is-
sued a statement Friday, lamenting 
Schraer's death and praising "her 
wannth, graciousness and her pro-
found dedication to the welfare of 
UCR and the university."

PRESIDENTIAL RUN-OFF 

Mike Holmes for A.S. President 
Tne Associated Students elections last week produced clear 

winners in every contest except the mce for A.S. President. None of 
the four pre ' identialcontenders received more than 50 percent of the 
vote. which means that the top two contenders will [.lce each other 
again in a run-off election scheduled for this Wednesday. 

Mike Holmes and RubCn Dur.in were the top two candidates. 
receivi ng 42.5 percent and 32.2 percent of the vote. respectively. 
Both are ~easoned AS. veteran who have a good command of the 
i~sues and know the ins-and-outs of student politics. Both have 
c ncrete solutions to the problems they see facing the student body, 
such as rising fecs and the nagg ing question of autonomy. 

And they 've faced each other once before - two year., ago, in the 
racc for VP Administrative. Dud n won that time, and he did a

A.S. ELECTIONS 1992 

Much Ado About Referenda 
The major cOl1trover.,y in thi:. year's A~sociatcd Studenl~ clec-

ti 11~ hns nothing to do with a c1a!>h between candidates. charges of 
campaign violations, or Illuuslinging. Rather, last week's c le tions 
have come under cri tici sm for a seemingly hanmless change in the 
orncr of referend:.l listed on the ballot. 

On the sample ballot put out by the A.S. and printed in the 
Gu(/rdial/. amendmcnt #2 dealt with removing c1us, re trictions on 
A.S. senator positions. Amendment #3, meanwhi le, wns intended to 
change the po!>itionof student advocate to anelecteu, voting member 
of the A.S. On the actual ballot. however, these two amendments 
wcn: ~witchcd . 

Thc rever.,al may have played a role in the outcome of the 
election: the college senator amendmem was two percent shy of the 
two-thirds majority it needed for approval. while the ~tudent advo-
cate amendment was approved by 76.5 percent of the voters. 

Paul Wilcox, the spol1!>or of the college senator amendment. 
belicvcs that the ballot switch may have confused some voters. He 
a"kcd elcction mnnager Jennifer Fklim and Student Govemment 
Advi!>or Randy Woodard to pennit another vote. The reque!>t was 
denied, under the reasoning thnt any confused students should have 
renu the ballot more closely. 

While there is some merit [0 thi argument, the fact remains that 
there is no way thatthe defeat of the college senator amendment and 
the :.Ipprov.11 of the student advocate amendment can be considered 
fair. TIle small margin of defeat for the one amendment only 
undt:rxores that fact. 

Students who read the sample ballot and made their decision 
beforehand would most likely not have looked at the actual ballot 
vt:ry closely. This, in fac t, is the reason a sample ballot is printed -
so thaI vorers can make intelligent decisions br/II!'!! going to the 
polls. 

But once the order of amendmenl<; was switched on the ballol. 
confusi n was inevitable. No doubt many students thought they 
were voting 'yes' on one amendment when they were actually 
voting for the other. Obviously, reading the ballot closely would 
have cleared up any confusion, but consistency between the sample 
ballot and :.Ictual bailor would have prevented any confusion in the 
first place. 

Wilcox has tiled an appeal with the AS. judicial boarn, and we 
can only hope that it orners a new. fair vote. Otherwise, the results 
of the 1992 AS. election~ , li!"t: ~o man elections in the pa I, will be

COMMENTARY 

Americans Are Selling Out to TYranny 
• The people who continuously complain about 'the System' 
are the same fools who demand more and more government 

Oh, the madness! The 
insanity! When one 

over a person's means of 
subsistence, you have a 
great deal of leverage with 
that person. 

con iders the ideas and the 
sound bites during (he 
e lection season. one can 
only say that we are mad. 
Modem politics has been 
captured by the 
intellectual's gift for 
twisting the facts and the 
car salesman 's talent for 
selling a clunker. 

MEA CULPA/\1~n ROBI\SO\ 

What we should ask 
today is not, "Who 
controls the govemment?" 
but "Why so much 
govemment?" The person 
who blindly advocates 
more government is 

It has become very popular to be cynical 
these days about politicians and "the System." 
The madness, and likewise, the tr:.lgedy is not 
about di content with politicians - this is an 
age-old American tradition. Rather, t~ fault is 
with ourselves. wi th the way we misunderstand 
liberty and our Willingness to sell it to the 
highest bidder. The inevitable result: tyranny. 

Th)S is not a word used in everyday speech 
and it sports a certain atavistic ring. It used to 
strike mortal fear into its hearers in the 18th 
century and was used to describe British 
colonial rule before the American Revolution. 
111e word tyr.mny describes the loss of liberty 
to the force of the government. We don' t 
understand this today - hence our madness. 

Everyone wants liberty. Liberty is a good 
that people recognize. It is easily defined as the 
absence of coercion and compulsion. It i the 
freedom to act without fear of assault and it 
implies the responsibility of facing the conse-
quences of one's actions. 

Tyranny usually indicates the rule of a 
despot. but the word irself really describes the 
loss of liberty to an arbitrary rule. Arbitrary rule 
i not ju t the full-fledged totalitarian state that 
rndicals say already exi t . In fact, the founder.-
of the United States unckrstood this even better. 
Arbitmry rule or the gravitation toward thi s 
state is often economic. 

We have heard stories about the economic 
basis of the American Revolution: it was 
merely greed that fired the heans of the 
Revolutionary leaders, 

And yet they understood something we don 't 
today: GOI'r!mmelll is your ellemy. And the 
most famous tactic of government in controlling 
lives involves the economy. If you have control 

ultimately a worshiper of 
power. He is either afraid that people won 't act 
as he wi he if they are given too much latitude, 
or he' really thinks that government can solve 
everything. Our penchant today to tum to the 
government for everything as a first result is the 
source of our madness and the messy political 
wars which everyone hates. 

Folk>w this rule when you listen to anyone who 
talks about politics: the Sure-Fire Tyranny rule. 
Does the person who is presently harnnguing you 
urxlerstand that if you give the government their 
demands it makes the govemment more powerful? 
You see, the complaints citizens have about those 
in office when they are members of the opposition 
party are that the system is coercing or oppressing. 
But the gear.; of the government juggernaut tum 
both ways. 

TIle most famous tyrannies begin when 
people neglect this rule and begin to think the 
government can actually do everything the 
demagogue says. And once the demagogue gets 
power (whatever degree of tyrant may he be) he 
attacks the citizens' economic freedom. To 
'protect himself from criticism he then makes 
laws against speech and assembly. People will 
always have an opinion; the challenge to the 
Hjtlers and Stalins is to remove their means of 
communication. 

A helpful example of government monopoly 
destroying freedom is the Soviet Union. If 
every program for advancement is in the hands 
of the tate, I have nowhere to tum. My welfare 
depend on a false political allegiance to the 
Party. Government. as it gets bigger. inevicably 
becomes more incompetent and inept. Worship-
ers of government power don't understand this 
fact and tum like crack addicts to the govern-

TYRANNY LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
ContInued from JNII8 4 
ment to correct govemment-caused 
ills, begging for more of the false high. 

The economic rea lm is integral 
to free citizen . The revolutionary 
leaders were right because it is the 
free market that safeguards liberty . 
Freedom of the press means nothing 
when the government owns all the 
presses. Freedom to assemble is 
nothing when the government owns 
all the buildings. And when the gov-
ernment employs and directs work-
ers then where does your campaign 
get its workers? 

Editorial Portrayed New' Charter Inaccurately 
In this age of cynicism, do r 

really need to bombard the reader 
with facts and examples? Do I need 
to predict the future consequences 
of spending to solve every problem 
from childcareto funeral expenses? 
It is a madness, and yet we want 
more. Instead of .fndividual respon-
sibility, we want it eao;y. We think 
the govemment does it for free. 

TIle old understanding of tyr-
anny is that government never does 
anything for free-in fact, it does it 
at loss, subsumes responsibility and 
exacts the highest price of all: it does 
it at the expense of freedom. 

Both the Left and the Right have 
a wealth of stories about the misuse 
of the government tojust make life 
difficult for the opposition. 

Noone has a monopoly on being 
oppressed. The answer is not just 
get your guys in there. Why give the 
government the powers to under-
mine Iibeny in the first place?

Editor: 
1be University Center Board is 

quite alarmed:.lt the editorials being 
written by the Guardian in regards 
to actions taken by the board and the 
:.Idministration. A recent issue con-
tained an editorial ("Another Futile 
Power Grab," Mar. 9) that was bla-
tantly incorrect about the facts of 
the charter change. 

It is greatly disturbing to find 
that the paper is endorsing views 
that can be discounted as wrong at a 
cursory glance. The "UCB Revis-
ited" editorial h:.ld a slew of factual 
errors and blatantly misinfomled

statements leadin~ the board to ques-
tion whether the Editorial Board 
had read the revised chaner at all. 

TIle new chaner does not re-
move the A.S. or the GSA's input. 
as the Gllardian claimed. The new 
charter does remove the language 
that the board is advisory to the vice 
chancellor. However, this language 
i replaced with specific guidelines 
for how the administration can veto 
UCB legislation. Thischange would 
prevent the out of hand rejection

tration enjoys now, and instead al-

panies to resolve their differences. 
1bechanerchange are not intended 
as "another futile power grab." In 
fact , the changes would make the 
board and the administration more 
accountable to the campus. 

Before the editors stan leveling 
criticism for sloppy po·litics. they 
had betterbe sure thatcriticisl1l can' t

TEAMWORK HAS ITS OWN REWARDS 
Just ask the UCSD Earth Day Festival team. Winner of the 1991 
Saturn Award at University of California, San Diego. 
Passion. Commitment. And this team of campus organizations 
made a difference. Organizing a festival that attracted nearly 
4,000 visitors. Providing information booths. Featuring guest 
speakers addressing environmental concerns. 
At Saturn, we know the value of teamwork. It was the driving 
force behind America's newest automobile company in more than 
40 years: And resulted in a new way of making cars. 
That's why we want to reward a student team in 1992 for its 
outstanding accomplishments. We're looking for the most out-
standing jointly-sponsored campus program by two or more 
registered student organizations. 
The campus winning team will: 
• Receive $1,000 at a Saturn-hosted reception 
• Become eligible for the $5,000 national award presented 

at Saturn 
Teamwork has its own rewards. Go ahead. Just ask the Earth 
Day Festival team. 
And over 5,000 Saturn team members in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

HOUSING 
ContInued fnIm .... 1 
percent of the (40 percent) student 
tuition increase will go indirectly to 
build a donn and office l?uilding in 
Washington. D.C.!" 

But project planners insi t the 
construction of the center would not 
involve tate funds. and thal it would 
pay for itself through housing and 
other utility fees. 

"Mr. Stark did not have a full 
understanding of how the project 
would be funded,"saidUCDirector 
of Federal Government Relations 
PaulSweet. He described the meet-
ing as ;'very cordial," and Said that 
Stark's parting words were, ''I'm 
going to layout of your hair on this 
project." 

Before Wednesday's meeting, 
Bill Vaughan, an administrative as-
sistant for Stark's office, said, 
"We're trying to call anemion to 
this issue. We think it's a illy ex-
penditure. " . 

Sweet said the main purpose of 
the meeting was 10 assure Stark that 
money would not be divened from 
the strained university budget to fund 

the project. 
The 34.000-square-foot facility 

would include 84 apartment units, 
office space, conference rooms and 
classrooms. and would be located 
near the center of the capital. It 
would house UC students and fac-
ulty working and interning in Wash-
ington, D.C. Although the UC Re-
gents have endorsed the idea, the 
District of Columbia has not ap-
proved it yet. 

Mike Alva., a representative of 
UC President David Gardner, said 
the housing development is in re-
sponse to a growjng interest among 
UC students to work and intern in 
the capital, and to student demand 
for housing close to their work areas 
and to UC students and faculty. 

Dean Schloyer, director of the 
national internship program at 
UCSD's Associated Students In-
temship Office (ASIO), said the 
Washington Centerwould "increase 
the opponunity for students dra-
matically .11lere are a lot of students 
who face uncenainty [when apply-
ing for D.C. internships). They don 't 
know where they'll live." 

AccordingtotheASIO,approxi-

Monday, April 13, 1992 

mately 600 UC tudents annually 
workandinteminWashington,D.C. 

Schloyer said that students cur-
rently either live in housing offered 
by UCLA, which he described as 
"overpriced and not in a good loca-
tion," or they find housing for them-
selves, often not knowing the qual-
ity or conditions unti I they get there. 

Third College junior Jennifer 
Reihm, who hopes to intern at the 
Smithsonian Institute this summer, 
noted that often firms and govem-
mental depanments are concerned 
about whether a potential internee 
will have housing. 

" If you say you have housing 
through the university, that would 
be one wall you would get over. It 
looksbenerontheemployer' ide," 
Reihrn said. 

Fifth College senior Sean 
Cummings, who interned in Wash-
ington, D.C. last summer, said that 
he lived "in the gheno." 

Alva said that university repre-
sentative are currently negotiating 
two possible sites for the develop-

ment~ one nearthe campus of George 
Washington University,and one on 
Pennsylvania Avenue.

Mason registered 10 saves in the 
contest. 

"She did a great job." Harper 
said of his goalie_ 

TIle Tritons jumped out to a 5-1 
lead before Davis knew what was 
happening. UCSD remained finnly: 
in control and led 7-2 at halftime 
before coasling to the ix-goal win_ 

"We were pretty much in control 
all the way." Harper said. "Wejust 
jumped all over them." Brend~ 
Reiton and Jamie Dailey mackeq 
the canvas for a combined eight of 
the 10 goals in the winning effort. ' 

Harper anticipates Ihat the win 
will vault the Tritons, currently 
ranked third in the nation. to the 
number-one spot. TIle team will 
know later this week . 

On Sunday, UCSD dropped a 
close game to Ihe Sunset Club team 
IO-S. 1be Tritons couldn't feel too 
bad. however, as Sunset went on 10

wilh a tough loss to Commerce 
Aquatic ,a club squad, 13-12.

After lhe disappointing 7-2 loss 
on Friday, the Tritons hoped to re-
cover against Claremont College on 
Sunday. However,thingsdid ootgo 
as planned as UCSD was swept 9-0 
by the visiting Stags.

the U.S. national team. 

These athletes, as well as a trong 
AuslJalian tearn with many of ils 
own national athletes, made forgood 
compelirion both on the tmck and in 
the field. 

A number of meet and stadium 
records were broken in both the 
men's and the women' events. 

The international influence was 
strong in selling many of these 
records. Austr-Jlia set several, with 
many of its athletes competing in 
the U.S. in a final effort to qualify

In game three La Verne took a 3-
o lead. but Bruce Williams stepped 
up to serve for ix Straight, helping 
UCSD take a 7-4 lead_ At 9-7, the 
Triton shut down the Leopard of-
fense, not allowing it a single point. 
UCSD took the third game 15-7 to 
finish the match. 

Wilde felt that the team per-
fonned well ovemll. "We had op-
portunities where we could have let 
them back in and we pushed 
through," he said. 

Kerr hit well for the night with a 
.714 hilling percentage. He had II 
kills in 14 allempts with only I 
error. 

Bruce Williams had eight kills in 
13 allempts wilh only one error for 
a hilling percentage of .53S. 

The Tritons had 20 blocks as a 
tearn on the evening. Wilde cited 
blocking as a key in the Tritons' 
win.

In football it's imple. Points for 
louchdowns and yard,,_ In the case 
of defenders it's sacks and number

at 59'4". Other competitors from 
Brazil. Great Britain and Gennany 
kept the competition tough in both 
the tmck and field event . 

The pressure of tough competi-
lion pushed many Tritons to their 
best perfonnances of the season. 
Patrick Foy gave his best perfor-
mance in the SOO-meter race with a 
time of 1:54_16. Denise McFayden 
ran her best time this season in the 
1,500-meterrace coming in second. 
and J ill Lyday improVed her NCAA 
qualifying mark in thediscus. Mich-
elle Milledge ran herbestlOO-meter 
race, and Samuel Gwynn ran hi 
best 5,OOO-meter race in a time of 
15:2 1.64. 

TIle women's 4x100 relay came 
close to its best time of the season 
and finished second. while Diane 
FrilZcame within oneone-hundreth 

Wilde anticipated a tough match 
with Santa Cruz on Saturday. The 
Banana Slugs had already beaten 
the Tritons once this season. "If we 
get them down. we want to shut 
them down. We don't want to give 
them a breath of life and let them 
back into the game," Wilde said 
before lhe malch. 

TIle Tritons started out the match 
strongly,taking a 3-0 lead in game 
one. 

There were six ties and the lead 
changed hands seven times. The 
Banana Slugs rallied for five point 
to come from behind and take the 
lead at 14-13. 

The Tritons had an opportunity 
at 15-14 but they were unable to 
finish. Santa Cruz went on to win 
the game 17-15. 

UCSD never started playing in 
game two. Santa Cruz jumped out to 
aquick 7-3 lead before gliding to an 
easy 15-3 win. 

UCSD.shaking off the game two

What occurs if you suffer a 

Whiplash? 
Whiplash is most commonly the 
result of an auto accident. 
Whether the head is snapped 
forward or backward, the shock 
is felt in the neck when the head 
moves one way and the body 
another. Common symptoms 
resulting from an untreated 
whiplash injury may include 
headache, neck pain and 
stiffness, muscle spasms, 
dizziness or numbness in one or 
both arms. A simple, painless 
spinal examination can' quickly 
reveal if you can be helped by 
chiropractic. Why be sick when 
you can be well?

Banking 
on Food 
By ERICA MAIENSCHEIN 
CONTRIBUnNG WRIIIR 

In a sheltered college community, 
students don' t hear much about food banks 
or similar organizations. Yet severnl of 
these groups serve those in need through-
out San Diego, including the San Diego 
Food Bank (SDFB), SHARE, Love's Gift 
and United Way. They serve the commu-
nity in various ways, with varying 
amounts of participation required of the 
recipient. The government gives very liule 
financial support, and often none al all . 
~ The SDFB has served the community 
for only 15 years, but has already become 
the largest of its kind in the area. It collects 
and dislributes donated food that might 
otherwise be wasted. 

Reaching outside the city for support, 
the SDFB is a member of Second Harvest, 
a service that connects donating growers, 
distributors. manufacturers, and retailers 10 
food banks nationwide. While donations 
mainly come from Second Harve t ;md 
from local manufacturers and retailers, the 
annual Holiday Food Drive brings in large 
amounts of community contributions. 
Over the course of last year, seven million 
pound of food were donated, which adds 
up to roughly 18 tractor-trniler loads per 
month. 

"We act as a not-for-profit Price Club," 
claims Matthew Packard, public relations 
representative for SDFB. Non-profit 
community service organizations shop 
there for free food every week. "They're 
welcome to however much they need," he 
explains. 

These organizations include day care 
centers, rehabilitation clinics, senior 
centers and child abuse shelters. among 
others. Currently. 304 member organiza-
tions "shop" there. 11le SDFB monitors 
each member to insure thai they use the

Village, comprised of five shelters far 
the homeless and needy 

I T 
fi rsl glance. Jo;m Kroc Center (JKC) Illay look rolther e labor.lIe - I ike a gl itlering mecca, ~ome have 
said. After all , the building, whose courtyard features a bclltowcr and a " fanta~y" playground, took 
nearly five years and $15 million to build. 

For its residents, however, the shelter is more of a refuge from cold wcather or streel vio lence - it's 
somewhere to stay when times are rough. a place to call home. 

JKC isone of five main shelters that make up SI. Vincent de Paul Village, a San Diego-based service for 
the homeless and needy. Although the SI. Vincent de Paul Sociely, comprised of pari h groups which rJise 
money for the poor, is a national program, SI. Vincent de Paul Village i an independent organi~lt ion which 
provides shelter for 500 homeless people and various services for 1.000- 1,500 others everyday. 

Originally a church-run thrift store, the organization was initially called the SI. Vincent de Paul Center. 
When Father Joe Carroll, a Catholic priest. joined in 1982, he transformed the center into what is now called 
" the village."

MOIIJAY, APRI. 13, 1992 UCSO GUARDIAN fEATURES 

g a Connection 
The Volunteer Connection places volunteers with over 200 programs 

BY SIMONE M illER . CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

"Volunteer - it feels good" says t~ sign 
next to the Voh,ulteer Connection office, and 
this message must be true considering the 
number of people involved in volunteer pro-
grdms at UCSD today. Each college on cam-
pu has its own separate community service 
progr.tm, but the Volunteer Connection is (he 
clearing house where these opponunities can 
be found on a database with 250 listings of 
agencies and programs and matched with the 
right person or group. 

TIle Volunteer Connection has created 
many programs and has provided a huge 
amount of community service for the San 
Diego community. 

Most of the VolunteerConnection 's ongo-
ing progr.tms work with elemelllary and jun-
ior high school students in the San Diego area. 
Perhaps the most well known of these pro-
grams is ASK, Active Students for Kids, 
which consists of a group of about 80 UCSD 
students who work as teaching assistants and 
one on one tutors forchildren from kindergar-
ten through fifth gmde. Tutors work with the 
children about two to four hours a week. 
Tutors gain some valuable teaching experi-
ence as well as valuable relationships. "You 
get a real sense of sorneone's life and your 
impact on their life when you're involved in 
an ongoing program like that," says Michelle 
Van Sambeelc, the current Director of the 
Volunteer Connection who began volunteer-
ing at UCSD in the ASK progrdm. 

ASK has obviously had a positive impact 
on many lives. Bay Parle Elementary School 
and Toler Elementary School reponed that 

student showed a significartt improvement 
in their schoolwork when working with ASK 
tutors. Chris Kim. the Director of the ASK 
progr.tnl feels that , " if just one child benefits 
from ASK, if we make an impact onjusl one 
person's life, it maices all ofoureffons wonh-
while." 

FUN, Friends Understanding Needs, is 
another project sponsored by the Volunteer 
Connection. but instead of helping kids aca-
demically, it offers a "mentoring program" 
that provides strong role models and hope-
fully strong friendships for sixlh graders at 
local middle schools. Van Sambeek com-
pares FUN to the Big Brother/Sister program. 
a progmm that matches children who may 
need a shoulder to lean on with college stu-
dents who devote about two to four hours a 
week with the children. UCSD students be-
come involved in this program in the beciin-
ningofFall Quaner and usually stick with the 
same child year-round; FUN is a progmm that 
stresses the imponance of close emotional 
relationships between the volunteers and the 
children. 

Foranyone who was interested in FUN but 
missed getting involved last fall, or for those 
who want to stan a new project, an in-home 
tutoring program for children in the Pulitzer 
Housing development is beginning this quar-
ter. This program hopes to provide both tutors 
and mentors to students in second grade all the 
way up to the high school level. The tutors' 
main objective will be to improve the litemcy 
of the students, but they are expected to build 
friendships with these students as well. 

Tutoring and mentoring pro-
grams are not the only projects 
that are offered by the Vol un-
tee rConnection. Habitat for 
Humanity is an interna-
tional organization that 
goes to Tijuana four Sat-
urdays a quaner;md builds 
houses. This program 
works with carpenters, and 
the manual labor is still very 
tough. yet there is a sense of 
such achievement through 
the uccess of a group effort 
that the hard work is wOl1h 
every minute. Van Sambeek 
says. 

Many one-day events are 
sponsored by the Volunteer 
Connection . On Apr. I L 
UCSD students panic ipated 
in Hands o n San Diego. a 
community service project 
that focused on issues Ihat 
need to be addressed in 
IOOay's ~ociety. Volunteers

suchasa food drive for people

"Over the pa~t 40 years ... SI. Vincent de Paul

where our re~ident and clients can find every-
th ing they need to make their li ves better: medi-
cal care. food di~tribution . restaurant . school,

men, women and the ill:' Carroll said, explaining

Elaborating n these service. Division Di -

rector of Re~identia l Services Jim DiCenzo 
explui ned that at the Bishop Maher Cenler 
(BMC), which i de igned for the chronically 
homelel>s male. a person may get a haircut take 
a shower and U!.e the message board. At JKC. 
one can go to the medical and dental clinics for 
a check-up. 

Olher shelters which fonn the village in-
clude the Ramona Shelter, which serves home-
less men wh are documented farm workers: 
Jo~ue Hou!>C, a home for men and women livin ' 
with HIV: and the Toussaint Teen Cel'ter, a 
shelter forteen:. age ' 14- 18 which opened ear-
lierthis month. During the wintermonth • BMC 
is converted into a cold wC4lther shelter, where 
residents are given a cot and a hot meal. 

The ' helters are funded mainly through indi-
vidual contributions. and function through the 
effort of thousands of volunteers. 

DiCenzo said that the village provide ser-
vices for the needy because. despite a person ' s 
ci rcumstance , "everyone has the right to be 
housed inudecentenvironment ... no one [ houldj 
have to sleep in the cold. have nothing (0 eat:' 

According to "Erica," a re ident at JKC. the 
homeless and needy population that the village 
serves is not at all homogeneous. 

'The public [may think] that all homeless 
people leepon cots. weardirty clothes. have no 

aspirJlions in life. Pe pie don' l real ize that you 
can't lump all homeless people together any 
more than you can lump society as a whole 
together." said Erica, who studied music and 
psy hology for three years at Northwestern 
University. 

". would have gone on, doing something in 
animal sc ience ... studying the effect of music on 
how cows give beuer milk," she said ... , wanted 
to do some kind of research combining the two 
areas." 

Erica neverfini hed school , though. She said 
that problems at home were "eSGllat ing" - that 
her mother blamed her for the death of a sibling 
and didn ' t want her to study music. When she 
came down with mononucleosis and lost an 
entire 4uarter, she had to drop out. 

,,' didn't have the emotional support system 
to counter the life stresses I was undergoing. 
Since I was left on my own in every way.' came 
to a conclusion -to put myself through the rest 
of school [would mean having I a full-time job. 
So I ju t never went back." she said. 

"Bill." on the olherhand, fini hed his under-
graduate education. but soon found himself an 
alcoholic and drug addict. 

"I had about three years of sobriety. Then I 
had a relapse," explained Bill, who has a degree 
in business management from New Yori< Uni-
versity (NYU). "'n a period of about two weeks, 
'lost my apartment-everything except my car 

/ L 
PRE 

and the clothes on my bock:' 
Bill said thaI he wenlto Laguna Beach for 

a while. bul that area "doesn' t have public 
shelters of any sort. no drug rehabilitation 
places that are city-funded." 

After making a number of phone calls, Bill 
eventually came to the village, where he was 
able to acquire the medications. clothes and 
other essentials he needed. 

"It's enabled me to put the pieces of my life 
back together, to put my feet back on the 
ground," Bill said about the village program, 
which he has been a part of since August.

"Rita." another JKC resident, said that al-
though she carne from a poor family . she al-
ways thought she was on track. 

'" used to live the American dream - that 
if you get an education, join a few clubs, you ' ll 
have a house, friends, money . ... 1 never thought 
English and business .. . would be transient 
kills," said Rita, who graduated from Cal State 

L.A. as an English major and business minor. 
Trouble started for Rita just after gmdua-

tion, when she lost her mother and then found 
out she was adopted. She said she had nothing 
to rely on - nothing, that is, but "myself and

Today, Rita is unemployed. Although she i '

Fresh Sran. she says she wouldn't go to college 
again. 

"You can imagine when you ' re 30 years old. 
you look back and think how much time and 
money you put into being educaled ... , got my-
self into unnecessary debt," she said, "and it's 
devastating. 'didn't find myself in the flow of 
American life I thought I should be in." 

While Rita was thankful to be able to stay in 
the village. she said that. as a resident in a shelter.

" In a ~helt er. you can'l just go to the ~alon

get a place to tay, then you' re no longer 
homeless. My job is to get them out of be ing 
homeless." 

Some shelters gear their effo rts toward those 
moti vated to c hange thei r s ituation of 
homelessness. For example. JKC requirrs a 
referml of potential res idents. which they can 
a qui re from a chu rch. community group or 
shelter staff worker. Depending on personal 
circumstances. the resident can take shelter for 
up 10 18 months, during which time he or she 
prepares to get back inlo the mainstream. 

Since many of the village 's progmms are 
for children, residents who are parents can 
concentrate on studying or job-hunting. Chil-
dren in gmde levels from kinderganen through 
eighth grade whose families live in JKC must 
attend HarborSummit School . which is funded 
by the city and located across the street. Through 
the Children's Services Program, children and 
teens panicipale in after-school activities,such 
as hands-on education projects and field trips. 

According to Children's Progmms Man-

FOOD 
Continued from page 51 
donated food properly. 

A new "Brown Bag" program 
ha<; JUSI been implemented. 
providing supplemental bags of 
groceries for low-income senior 
citizens. 'The progr.un currently 
serves 600 people throughout San 
Diego. Funds to expand this 
program are scant, and the SDFB 
now asks food donon; for 
monetary contributions as well. 

Currently. the SDFB employs 
eleven staff members. in addition • 
to receiving roughly 1.500 houn; 
monthly in volunteer service. This 
does not suffice. however, for the 
amount of work involved in 
receiving, soning. storing and 
distributing food, as well as 
monitoring member agencies and 
picking up food from donon;. 
Pac kurd stressed the growing need 
for volunteen; in any capacity and 
for any time commitment 
possible. 

1be Self Help And Resource 
Exchange (SHARE) serves the 
community in an unusual way. 
requiring both a monetary 
donation of $13 and two hours of 
community service in exchange 
for a supplemental food package 
valued between $30-$35. 1bere 
are no eligibility requirements 
whatsoever to participate in the 
program. 

"We're trying to encoumge the 
notion of self-help," asserts Jeff 
Meyers. a SHARE representative. 
"lOur typical participantsj are not 
welfare patients, not street people 
and they are not indigent. They're 
just regular people who could use 
savings of 60 percent on food . 
With this progmm, they can 
maintain their dignity and pay 
their own way. without pride or 
interfering:' 

SHARE was founded less than 
10 years ago, yet it has already 
expanded to incl ude an interna-
tional aspect. It sells excess 
commodities donated or left over, 
and raises money for progmms in 
Guatemala and Mexico. These 
international programs include the 
construction of sewer systems and 
development of agriculture. in 
addition to other community 
services. In Guatemala. the 
progmm established a banking 
system that aids small pottery 
businesses owned by women. 

SHARE relies entirely upon 
volunteer assistance and receives 
no govemment or private aid. 
Meyers emphasizes the need for 
assistance in the warehouse and in 
all functions of the organization. 

Packard sums up the valuable 
service food banks provide: 
"Many of [the patrons of food 
banksj operate on a shoestring 
budget. Not much of the fedeml or 
the state budget goes to them. This 
is a creative and productive way 
for them to get the food they 
need."
