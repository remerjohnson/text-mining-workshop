Reagan, Budget Threaten Quality Education at University 
Rick Drom 

Have budget restrictions caused 
quantity to matter more than the quali-
ty of education at the University of 
California? 

This question bothers many who feel 
the answer is yes. Their worries are not 
without basis considering the UC's 
proposed 1973-74 budget. It calls for an 
increase of only $14 million instead of 
$53 million which Charles Hitch, Presi-
dent of the University, had requested. 

" Hitch said that the $14 milli'on in-
crease in operating support will not 
even meet price increases and other 
increased costs which the university 
cannot control," according to the L.A. 
Time . 

The causes for this shortchanging of 
the UC are partly due to the ambiguity 
of the UC's public image. 

Are "research al1d advanced 
graduate training the unique r~spon­
sibi lity of the UC and its most impor-
tant function?", as an article in the L.A. 
Times said? Or must the UC artfully 
combine both research and un-
dergraduate education? 

If the UC is to be just like the 
California State University and 
Colleges, then funding should be com-
parable. But if the UC is to be an 
institution which is also concerned 
about expanding man's knowledge 
and undertaking much research, then 
a different funding criterion is called 
for. , Too Much Rese~rch 

Governor Ronald Reagan is respon-
sible for the UC's budget each year. He 
feels that the University has gone a 
"degree too far in the emphasis on 
research." He "would like from the 

Volume 18, Number 7 

University mar of an effort 0 see if 
w can't get more for the dollar than 
they've been inclined to do." 

Research i just one of various 
reasons why many feel that Reagan 
favors the California State University 
and Colleges over the uc. Next year's 
propo ed education budget adds 
credibility to this charge. 

"The tate university, according to 
William Trombley of the L.A. Times, 
" received a 16.9% increase in total 
spending (including proposed faculty 
alary increa es) although anticipating 

an enrollment increase of only 2.2%, 
while the UC received an 11 .6% boost 
with a projected 4% enrollment in-
crease.': 

Th re are many opinions as to the 
reason for Ragan's actions toward the 
uc. Trombley said," orne believe that 
Reagan is hostile to the UC because 
some of his strongest political backers 
in Southern California are USC men 
who believe the UC offers unfair com-
petition for private schools." 

Others believe that he favors the 
state colleges and university because 
Reagan went to Eureka College, a 
university because Reagan 

Others believe that he favors the 
state colleges and university because 
Reagan went to Eureka College, a 
small, liberal arts institution. "My idea 
of higher education, " Reagan has 
said," is four years on a campus with 
red brick walls and you leave with a 
tear in your eye." 

The University of Californ ia does not 
seem to fit this description . It is con-
cerned with "high quality research," 

ac ording to the L.A. Times, "and the 
training of the very best graduate 
students - not the second best or the 
10th best but the very best. " 

This is why many critic ize the UC for 
bing an elitist institution . 

This campus, at least, "does not d ny 
or apologize to anyone fo r bing 
elite," accord ing to Paul Saltman, vice-
chan cellor of Academic Affairs at 
UCSD. "I make no bones about it," he 
said . " We are a democratic elitism 
where all who are qualified and all who 
excel can come." 

Other reasons offered for the UC's 
position in Reaga n's eyes stem from 
the "radicalization" of the UC due to 
ev nts at Berkeley and Sa nta Barbara 
and Vie tnam wa r protests. 

" Th Vietnam war radicalized a 
generation of kids and at the same time 
it conservatized a whole gen ration of 
older people who saw what was going 
on - the protest, the long hair, the 
'counte rculture ' - and didn 't like it," 
said Roy G. D' Andrade, a UCSD 
anthropologist in an L.A. Times article . 

" In that situation Reagan was able to 
paint a picture of a university that most 
of us didn't recognize but apparently 
wa believed by many people." 

Af'other reason for the small in-
cre" e in spending for the UC was 
given by State Finance Director Verne 
Orr in an L.A. Times article . "The basic 
reason for our relative difference in 
the funding of the university and the 
state colleges is that we think that there 
are many, many areas where the un-
iversity can produce effici ncies and 
economics." 

At UCSD that does not (ern to be

Is Peace Here? Last Tuesday when President Nixon announced to the nation that a ceasefire in Vietnam would go into effect Saturday and that peace was imminent in 
Southeast Asia, reactions among UCSD students were 
varied and revealing. Overall, while most students 
approved of the peace agreement, their statements 
expressed confusion and lingering doubt about the 
prospects of real peace in Vietnam. A sampling of their 
remarks : 

A UCSD Reaction 

Ron Ci~rrett : "It' about time. I kind of expected it to 
happen before the election and I was disappointed. 
I'm a Ii ttl more satlsfiedwith Nixon now that he'~ 
pull d out." 

Jodi Christi~nsen : "Nixon has a talent for things that 
look important but really aren't. I don't think his 
decision mean that much. I think h just did it to 
pa ify the p opl , and the moron ar eating it up . 
We'll b back th r ." 

th case. altman said that, "W h v 
pared the budg t down so that all that 
is left is vital tissue. We are now at the 
point wh r we literally can't do what 
we've done in th past." 

In support Saltman cited th fact that 
UCSD now has 25% to 30° '0 less real 
dollars than it had 6 years ago. UCSD's 
student-faculty ratio has now increased 
to 18.6 to 1. This is compar d to the 
tate university and coli ge who e 

average this year is only 17.94 to 1. 
Orr also ant nd that th UC could 

sav money by, "p rsuadlng it~ 
prof s ors to spend mar time on 
teaching and less on research and by 
Impl menting r commendations 
Finance Departm n auditor~ hav!' 
mad for Improving l i brar y 
operations." Th se re omm ndatlons 
include consolidation of the eight 
campus libraries Into two great 
r earch librari 5 at Berkeley and 
UCLA with maller, k leton libraries at 
the other seven campuses. 

Th proposed Reagan budget will 
'1ot aid plans for improving the 
ibraries. It calls for a book acquisition 
ate 5°:0 b low this year's and 19.4% 
)elow that of 1969-1970. 

Hitch said that, This is undoubtedly 
one of the most serious threats to the 
quali ty of the university - the con-
tinued erosion in acqusition of books" 

The answers to these budget and 
qua lity of educa tion problem at the 
UC are not yet at hand . At stake is the 
feeling ex pr essed by William 
Trombley," that a great university the 
greatest this cou ntry has put together 
with public funds, is sli pping down to 
the level of mere adequacy."

Tutoring Available ~ 
for Veterans 

GI Bill student with academic problems can get 
Veterans Administration fi nanced tutoring more easily 
under the provisions of a law that became effective 
O ct. 24, according to Gordon R. Elliott, Dir ctor of BA's 
outhern California Regional' Office. 
The new law, which also increased educational 

benefi ts, removed the requirement that a s udent must 
be failing a course to be eligible for a VA-paid tut~r. It 
also made tutoring available for the first li'ne to Wives, 
widows and ch ildren studying under Ihe age ncy's 
Dependents' Educational Assistance progrdm. 

Tutorial assistance first became availabl in March 
1970 under Public law 91-219, Elliott <aid. It was 
d sign d for veterans and servicemen studyi ng on a 
half-time or more basis at post secondary level who 
needed help in passing courses essen tial to their 
programs of education. 

For this help, VA paid tutors up to $50 for ~ch 
month or portion of a month they tutored, up to a 
maximum of nine months. 

Und r the new law, however, VA pays tutors for th 
actual time they tutor, up to a maximum of $50 a 
month . This tends to "stretch" tutorial benefits which 
eligible persons may continue to use until a total of 
$450 is exhausted. 

either law charges tutorial assistance agai nst the 
veteran's basic educational entitlement earned during 
military service, Elliott pointed out.

featu red in the second of 
the series of one man 
shows by members of the 
Fifth Moon Group, 
throught February 18 at the 
Fine Arts Gallery of San 
Diego. This group is com-
posed of Chinese artists 
who, since the mid-1950'S, 
recapitulated Western 
"isma" and looked for 
their new spirit in Picasso; 
Klee and the modern 
classics. They are co n-
cerned with the interpreta-
tion of Chinese paint ing in 
terms of abstract ex-
pressionism. 

The exhibition is com-
prised of about a dozen 
paintings. This series of ex-
hibitions is sponsored by 
the Asian Arts Committee. 

The artist was born in 
Fukien, China , 1916. He

joined the Fifth Moon 
Group in 1965. He has ex-
hibited his work in 
Australia , the Ph ilippines, 
Brazil, France and Pe ru , as 
well as in th United States. 
Titles of works include 
"Hibernating," "Day and

Forty-four Europ an and 
American contemporary 
tapest ries and fiber works 
will be on view at the Fine 
Arts Gallery, Ba lboa Park, 
also through February 18. 

The tapestries are on 
loan fr om the J . L. 
Hu rschler Collection, 
Pasadena . This collection is 
considered one of the most 
important in the United 
States. It is comprised of 
tapestries woven in the 
traditional method and 
from limited designs. 

Fourtee n countri s are 
r presented by twenty-
nine artist-craftsmen . 
Among the nations in-
clu ded are Austria, 
Bulgaria, Columbia, 
Czechoslovakia, France, 
Hungary, Portugal and 
Sweden. 

Mr. and Mrs . Hurschler 
discovered a strong revival 
of interest throughout 
Europe in the highly skilled 
art of tapestry production 
while traveling and visi ting 
artists and weavers . In 
showing their collection in 
the United States, they 
hope to stimulate an ap-
preciation for the contem-
porary manifestations of an 
age- aid art form. 

The exhibition may be 
viewed 10 a.m . to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday through Saturdall 
and 12:30 to 5 p.m. Sunday. 
A catalogue is available. 

Up Against the Wall 
Showing now through 

March 4 is "The Wall Ob-
ject," an exhibition 
assembled by the la lolla 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art. 

The works by 23 artists 
are designed to occupy 
wall space but fit neither of . 
the traditional definitions 
of "painting" or "sculp-
ture." 

In discussing the show's 
concept, the Museum's 
Assistant Director, 

Lawrence Urrutia, pointed 
out that the participating 

artists display varying con-
cerns, but all have in com-
mon the integrity of the 
artwork as object .

I~ETTEIS T8 THE ' Ell,. 
Dr. Ruiz 
Participated· In 
Productive 
Discussion 
Editor, Triton Times: 

In reading TT's report 
(1/23) of Dr. Ruiz's remarks 
at the UC D women 's 
mecting January 18, it oc-
curred to me that th real 
srnse of his statements 
might not have been clear 
to ot her readers. The space 
limitations of a short report 
made it difficult to set inro 
context the wide-ranging 
and productive discussion 
that took place. Everything 
that was said was specifical-
ly in reference to affir-
mative action needs, both 
in regard to employment 
of women and minorities 
and course offerings and 
content. Dr. Ru iz discussed 
frankly with us the dif-
ficulties all institutions are 
having in overcoming the 
past imbalance in faculty 
staffing. We are all aware 
that UCSD, among the 
various UC campuses, has 
the most severe affirmative 
action problem since we 
have by far the lowest 
percentage of women 
faculty members. 

I, myself , raised the 
question of the Humanities 
Sequence cou rses, for 
having been a TA last 
quarter for the Jews and 

Greeks course, it had 
for efully bl'en brought 
home to me how the 
traditional approach to 
West rn Civiliza tion 
studies has perpetuated 
th e re~a tiv view of 
women '; role and women's 
a omplishment. We all 
agreed that " humanities" 
must include all races and 
both s('xes, and that the 
present Humanities Se-
qu nce n eds extensive 
revisioh if its present short-
comings in that regard are 
to be overcome. 

The fir t steps toward 
real integration of women 
and minorities in higher 
education come through 
the kind of forthright dis-
cussion of needs that our 
meeting with Dr. Ruiz 
provided. We look forward 
to similar meetings with 
other department 
chairmen through which 
the issues may be clarified 
apd an awareness of those 
needs can be forwarded.

Any Theory 
Valid In 
Institute of 
Higher 
Learning 

Editor: 
Re the letter from Tom Can-

tor and Bill Sjaholm on the 

right of the representation of 
the crea tion mod I at UCSD. 
I, al 0 , see no reason to ex-
clude the representation of 
any theory at Jny so-called 
institut of higher learning. 

Are we students not en-
titled to a review of all 
theorie r I, for one, did not 
co me here to be fed pre-
dige ted pap or to be carefully 
told what I should and should 
not believe. 

Isn't the theory of evolution 
still just a th eory? Many 
prominent scientists would 
now have me believe that it is 
incontestable fact. It is the 
duty of a scientist that he 
should keep an open mind; 
he should remember at all 
times that a theory, no matter 
how well it fits the data, is still 
a theory, not a fact. Coper-
nicus didn't believe in the 
terracentric theory, Colum-
bus, Einstein, and many others 
disbelieved in the prevalent 
opinions of their times. 

Several people object to the

one theory be excluded from

with several established 
religions? I find it distressing 
that many people could im-
mediately label as 
"s uperstition " or "myth" 
anything ass ociated with 
rel igion. A theory can be valid 
regardless of its origin. 

While we' re on the subject

believ in a theory is essen-
tially superstitious. As long as 
a theory is not yet a proven 
f act,. it must be relegated to 
the realm of possibility, along 
with atoms, God, and other 
thing that must b taken on 
faith. 

I therefore see no valid 
reason why the reation 
model shou ld be ignored in 
favor of th evolution theory.

Blatant 
Distortion 
In L.A. TIMES 
News Story 
De;u Edilor: 

There are many producers 
of mass media, many con-
sumers of it and even more 
victims of its sometimes 
massive distortion which is 
shielded under the guise of 
the "objective news story." In 
effect, these days one finds 
much more editorializing on 
news pages; editorial writers 
often opting for Eric 
Sevareid's bland porridge. 
Therefore readers must 
become anal ysts of such 
"news stories" as Don Cook's 
" Viet Cong Opens Political 
Drive Before Truce is Signed" 
(LAT, Jan. 26, p. 7). It is a clear 
lesson in the uses and abuses 
of the notion of objectivity. 

The story focuses on the 
accusation by Nguyen Thi 
Binh, foreign minister of the 
Provisional Reveolutionary 
Government of South Viet-
nam, that President Nixon is 
already violating the pea ace 
agreements by declaring that 
the Saigon government is the 
"only sovereign regime in 
South Vietnam." Bi nh insists 
that the peace accord "very 
clearly establishes two rival 
administrations in South Viet-
nam, two rival armies and two 
zones of controL" 

Now this point of conten-
tion would seem to be one of 
major importance, of great 
significance for those people 
whom Binh represents, who 
have moreover staked thpir 
lives on it. It is a matter which 
can be factually clarified by 
reference to the peace 

agreements themselves 
whi ch obviously contain 
some information on the 
matter. 

Instead of handling the 
material in such a serious 
man ner, Cook chooses to 
comment (editorially) that 
"All this may be of little prac-
tical importance right now." 
He would prefer to see it as 
"th creation of a propaganda 
and political base from which 
the Viet Cong with North 
Vie tnamese backing will 
"operate" in the future. We 
will not be told whether 
Binh's accusation is based in 
fact. The que~tion of whether 
President Nixon's intention 
might be equally or more 
thoroughly grounded in 
propaganda is uncuriously 
enough never asked. 

We need not consider these 
unimportant questions 
because aside from being 
prone to "propaganda", the 
Viet Cong has the additional 
misfortune of being 
represented by this person, 
Binh, Nguyen Thi Binh, Mrs., 
who happens to be a woman, 
and who has, according to our 
"objective" reported Cook, 
"always been something of a 
f ishwife at these peace talks 
these last years ." Therefore, 
with this sexist and classbiased 
slur in mind, we can without 
guilt or another thought, dis-
miss Ms. Binh's viewpoint that 
the only thing about the war 
which may have changed of 
late "is t hat the shoot i ng is 
about to stop," and that ob-
viously it can begin again at 
any moment if misinter-
pretations such as Nixon's are 
allowed to prevail. 

Being a "fishwife," riddled 
through with propaganda (pf 
which we Americans are free), 
Ms. Binh in these days of 
peace agreements (which may 
be meaningless) often foams 
at the mouth and her 
prophecies and charges 
should be disregarded, or, 
watched closely as 
"propaganda ." There is 
Cook's message, and it 
belongs on the editorial page. 
Could this "humble"{?) 
reader request a non-sexist, 
factual treatment of Ms. 
Binh's charges and fears?

SPO.RTS ~ 
Tritons Bow To 
Westmont By 9 
The Westmont Warriors deal t a severe blow to 

UCSD's AlA post-season tou rn ament hopes Fr iday 
night in the UCSD gym. The Tritons, behind the 
scintillating play of Gie Simpson and Paul Trainer, 
almost upset the 12th ranked Warriors before succum-
bing by a score of 69-63. Westmont, who carried a 13-3 
record and a reputation as the best small college team 
on the coast, looked truly awesome in warmups, and 
Paul was heard to mutter something about wishing he 
had gone scuba diving. But the Tritons utilized an 
aggressive full court pr ss and some outstanding in-
dividual performances to nearly pull off the victory. 

A small but fren7ied crowd inspir d Gie to his finest 
offensive display of the year as he hit for 16 points on a 
variety of drives and jumpers. He helped bring the 
Tritons to a 55-55 tie before fouling out with seven 
minutes remaining, and the Warriors were never 
caught again despite the heroic efforts of Paul who 
finished with 23. Pete Henderson and Dave Moragne 
also played great games. Pete was extremely tough on 
the boards against the much taller Qarriors, and Dave 
hit some clutch jump shots to garner 10 points. But the 
offensive rebounding of Westmont and the fall away 
jumpers of leaping Warrior forward Greg Smith were 
just too much for the Tritons.

Putting Your Toe Into It 
In basketball a 15-foot set shot is just not that tough . 

But put a guy at a line, with nobody guarding him, and 
everybody etst! on the whole court lined up watching 
him, call it a free throw, and watch how many times he 
will chike the shot. However, there are some hot shots 
who will swish that toss 9 times out of 10, and the 
Intramural Department will give them a chance to 
prove it. The First Annual Free Shooting contest will be 
held next Monday night at 10 pm in the gym. All you 
Rick Barry's and Wilt Chamberlain's are invited to 
come down and lay it on the line. There will be two 
divisions: Open and Pee Wee. If you're in Pee Wee 
league basketball, you can compete in the Pee Wee 
Division; otherwise you 're in the Open division. 

practiced to perfection in the last two years. The HOCS 
are back to prove that they can fall flat on their face 
again this year; it will be up to Mark and Dan to see if 
the WONDER will return to the WARTHOGS. 

There are sports enthusiasts .. . and then there are 
volleyball freaks. Volleyballers are known to come out 
any time of the day or night just as long as a net's up. 
ONE·TWO is the odds-on choice to win the open 
sixeds competition, but the real fun one this quarter is 
the mixed doubles. Mark Schilling and Joan Roberts 
look to be the top twosome, although Jay and Carol 
could beat anyone on a given night. 

I've run out of fingers trying to count all the activities 
in the intramural sports family this quarter. "Father" 
Lee Johnson is happy to announce that the newest 
arrival in his sports of all sorts is a bounCing, baby ball. 
Coed Kickball , under the dubious direction of Simple 
Sonja and her fai thful dog, Westwoman, was greeted 
by blue skies and sunshine in its first mellow weekend 
of existence. " Nostalgic" was the dey word as about 20 
teams signed up to playa game that probablY no or.~ 
had even thought about in the past five to ten years. 
Pete Carr was overheard telling his team" All right, 
Couples Only, same lineup as in fifth grade." Playing 
kickball you rediscover that a big brown ball just 
doesn' t f ield as easily as a little white one, nor does it 
throw as easil y, nor can you kick too far (especi ally if 
you're a guy and have to kick a " rollsie" with the wrong 
foot). The game's a blast, though , and is the perfect way 
to spend an hour while drinking ice-cold beer.

Christiane Rocheforte 
on Female Writers 

" France is a sexist place believes Christiane 
Rochefort, renowned French novelist from Pari s. In-
vited by the Literature Department, Ms. Rochefort was 
well received by audien ce of about seventy people at a 
lite rature Department informal m ee t ing la st 
Wednesday. 

Though hampered a bit by a lack of knowledge of 
spoken Engli h, Ms. Rochefort led a rattier lengthy 
discussion concerning " The Woman Writer in a Male 
Culture." First she read a statement which she had 
previously prepared. 

Besides writing Ms. ROchefort also " pa ints, plays 
music and sculpts" and "employs time enjoying 
herself. " 

Her lover discouraged her from writing after reading 
her first book, and she subsequently chose writing over 
him. 

One of Ms. Rocheforte's discoveries upon visiting 
America is that, contrary to her previous belief, a 
woman artist has fewer problems in France than 
America. She also finds that American women are more 
practical and act with less reflection than French 
women . 

Christian had some harsh words about the French 
cr itics who have rev iewed her books. She said that her 
firs t book //Le repos dugerrier 1958; (rrans . Warrior's 
Res t, Mckay N.Y.) was made a success because the 
cri tics deemed it an "audacious love story." Actually 
the author herself felt it was an anti-love story. She 
objected to the fact that cr itics review all female writers 
in one column and compare them to each other in 
thei r reviews. 

Reflecting upon the image of a writer in France, Ms. 
Rochefort felt that a writer is aWilys thought of as having 
a male image. Christiane Rocheforte found that during 
her forma l education only male writers were studied. 

In her latest Book, Ou Je jardin elince/anl (Trans. A 
Utopia) Ms. Rochefort describes her vision of what 
utopia should be like. Here she deals with the con-
trad iction of what life offers with what people think life 
offers. She proposes a political solution and then makes 
the economic solution secondary. 

Ms. Rocheforte says that men can't imagine women 
being critical of love or writers of obscenity. She feels 
that men feel the prototype woman is usually "for 
love." However, in her current book Ms. Rocheforte 
deals with love with a new look. Here she explores all 
types of relationships from male-male, male-female, to 
the relationship between animals. Here Christiane says 
that "new love can only occur if domination of one sex 
by the other ceases," She also feels that the sexist roles 
should be abolished and that each man should discover 
and reveal his feminine traits and each woman her 
masculine traits. 

Being a female artist, Ms. Rocheforte feels that men 
are jealous of her ta lent and that many men as well as 
1V0men have preformed conceptions about her 
writings. She says it is an "u npleasant experience not to 
be read honest ly." However, she receives letters from 
both men and women concerning her books. M s. 
Rocheforte feels that a woman artis t must be strong in 
order to survive in a male society and not pay attention 
to the various criticisms that she will arise in the course 
of her artistic career. 

M s. Rochefort is an active member of the Women's 
Libera tion Movement in France and she believes that 
there is no difference between being a woman and a 
feminist. She could not offer a clear definition of a 
feminist because there is she believes no such practical 
definition. Christian bel ieves that it is not necessary to 
be a militant to be feminist or a member of WLF. 

Are Good Students 
Successful in Business 

Success in business is 
directly reflected by the 
qu ality of the college 
attended and the grades 
and degrees achieve~, ac-
Cording to Dr. Robert 
Wise, research economist 
at University of California 
at Berkeley. 

In a survey of employees 
of large corporate 
bUSi nesses, he found that 
those who had attended 
the most select ive schools 
and gotten superior grades 
were more than twice as 
likely to be promoted as 
those who had gone to less 
selective schools and done 
poorly. The employees of 
the former category also 
received salary increases 
more Ihan twic~ as fast a 
those with poor scholastic 
reCords. 

Wi~e aid h found that if 
"one guy is from Harvard 
dod anoth r i from om 
othN school they start at 
th, am!' saJary." 

In dnsw r to qu tions 
about initia l res pon-

iI'S he did not find 

that those with better 
scholastic credentials were 
given better beginning 
pOSitions. 

After sixteen ye'ars he 
found that 92'10 of those in 
his highest rated group had 
attained middle manage-
ment positions as opposed 
to only 21 % of those in the 
lowest group. 

Other personal 
characteristics, such as 
desire for job ·securi ty, 
leadership and 
organizational ability and 
socioeconomic 
background, were assessed 
by responses to a question-
naire. 

Leadership abilities and 
early experiences in the 
firm which were favorable 
(i.e. during the first two 
yea r on the job the in-
d iv idual co mmunica t 
f r qu ntl y with higher 
manag me n t or was 
allowed to do cr ativ 
thinking) improv d 
chanc of uc . But 
tht-ir eff t, W,S ~Jid, wa 

continued ne t olumn 

The Getaway continued from page 3 
rig ht to share M cQueen's life by proving 
that shp be10ngs to the former category, 
that she is as superh uman and tough a 
dude as he is. But you ra nnot have 
super-human characters without sub-
human characters. These are provided in 
the subplot, concerning Mcq ueen's ex-
accompli e and the co uple he takes 
hostage. Playing the wife, Sally Struthers 
app ar to have been wai ting for years 
for some vir ile outlaw to take her to bed 
her and humil ia te her wi mpy husband. 
Wif and outlaw bed down in a series of 
motel rooms, but the real kicks are 
provid d by the presence of the hus-
band, tied to a chain and forced to 
wa tch. He finally pu ts an end to the 

preary charade by killing himself. 
Peckinpah has generall heeded the 

liberal critics, and does not kill off inno-
cent bystand rs in fight nes anymore . 
Obviously, wimpy husbands do not 
qualify as innoc nt und r his code, in 
fdCt the implication is that most of this 
wolin 's nastiness could be avoid d if 
there were more "real men" in control 
of their affairs dnd their women . In 
shortened form, powerles ness equals 
guilt . 

The bitch of it all is that am Peckin-
pah is a really brilliant filmmaker, and if 
his work weren 't so suffocalingly nasty, 
it might b a pleasure to watch. 

some element of education ranking degr is much 
does actually improve an more significant. Ap-

con tinued from column 2 

roughly equ ivalent to the 
difference between an A 
and a B stu dent in the 
academic measures. 

Wis said, h fou nd th at 

individuals likelihood to parently, those who work 
success. Acquiring a low harder and get better 
level MA degree does not, grades have more success-
in itself improve capability. no matter what school they 
According to Wise, a high. attend.

AFTER TEN MONTHS OF RESEARCH 

We pieced together a system we could 
recommend under $200. The ROTEL 150A 
receiver with its 2 yr. parts and labor warranty 
was found to deliver more power & better FM 
reception than all competition. Using 'Z-203 
(8 inch 2 way) speakers we weren't able to 
find anything that even came close to there 
smooth, natural sound. Finally the Garrard 
408 automatic turntable using the GRADO 
FeR cartridge gave us what we believe to be 
the best sounding combination .
