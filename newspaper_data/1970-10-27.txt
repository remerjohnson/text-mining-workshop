Is lms Anyway To Run A Protest? 

By John Maxwell 
Associate City Editor 

They came like a flash flood of merciless 
locusts pillaging through the Revelle 
dorms. Marching to the beat of a bass 
drum, they chanted their rhetorical 
slogans. Occupying and taking up 
headquarters in USB 2722, the "Mother 
Fuckers Murder Corporation and Private 
Marine Corps" (MFMC&PMC) , passed out 
applications and answered questions 
concerning career opportunities and 
'1dvancement with their organization. 

Setting the stage for the battle soon to 
~ome , the MFMC&PMC enunciated the 
~entral concept behind their ideology. 
rheir claim was that "You have to be a 
Motherfucker to be a Marine, but you don' t 
lave to be a Marine to be a Motherfucker." 

Enter the Good Guys· 
From nowhere, Captain America and the 

ment Majority, led by Jim Sills and Karl 
Keating running out of the right wing 
[ormation, suddenly crashed through the 

~FM~&PMC placards. Simultaneously, 
~aptam S. C. Berman and Lieutenant U. 
Watson of the United States Marine Corps 

i1lad~ their charging entrance to the cheers 
md Jeers of the 150 or so denizens who had 

lu~ckly gathered. The sight of women and 
~hll~r~n gathering at the batUesight was 
:emmlscenl of the early battles of the 
,-ivil War. 

The time had arrived. The Yippies had 
heir banners, kazoos, and lighthearted 
eers. The Silent Majority had Jim Sills 
tnd their "Tell it to Hanoi" posters. The 
JS Marines had a big red flag and shiny 
Ihoes. But nobody seemed to know what to 
10 ; everybody smiled, cheered, booed and 
ell back stunned. 
George Burchill, Dire tor of the Career 
~ducation and Planning Center, tepped 
nto the limelight and announced to th 
nultitude , "Everybody sit down and hut 
tp. We 're ready to commence the seminar 
In th Marine orp Officer Training 

~rogram ." Th format of the seminar wa 
o be a question and an wer period 
ollowed by th "igning-up" of intere ted 
Itudents. 

Question Prepares for Confrontation 
The opening question came from 

MFMC&PMC member Jay Gillette. His 
interrogatory statement seemed to create 
the atmosphere for the confrontation to 
come. Gillette was inquiring as to the 
legitimacy of a report that during World 
War Two, the U.S. Milrines suffered 217 
casualties on an Alaskan island that had 
been vacated by all Japanese troops. 

Between shouts, jeers, and reprimands 
to the audience from Burchill, the Marines 
tried to answer questions and comments. 
Most of the questions concerned the 
morality of killing in any context. No one 
would have known that a serious subject 
was being considered. 

A typical exchange went, "Is it true that 
you cannot tell one type of Vietnamese 
from another until they are dead? " "No, I 
can tell you from experience that you can 
tell the difference. I worked with 
intelligence and I can tell you that my men 
were trained to tell the difference." 

While on the subject of salary, one 
observer inquired, "Can you work on a 
commission basis if you choose?" "No". 

In the midst of all the mudslinging, 
Director Burchill was asked what he 
thought of the exchange and whether it was 
worthwhile in his opinion. "I think that 
some educational benefits are being had. I 
think it is educational to have students 
hear these two officers respond as people. 
It's sort of a fun atmosphere," he replied. 

Freaks vs USMC 
But meanwhile, the Marines got into the 

gaming spirit and requested that someone 
keep score. Captain Berman chalked a 
score sheet onto th blackboard and labeled 
the headings, "SDS" and " U MC". This 
wa una ceptable to the MFM &PM who 
imm diately revised them to read , 
" Fr aks" and "USM ". 

Freaks vs. America 

An unidentified Yippi garni hed with 
the American flag tepped in to core for 

the Freaks while Robert DeLeQllardls, a 
member of the Captain America and the 
Silent Majority faction volunteered to 
represent the Marines. DeLeonardis 
apparently later volunteered to represent 
the Marines in a significantly greater 
capacity. 

After several disagreements as to how 
the verbal war should be scored, 
DeLeonardis returned to his "I Like 
Thieu" poster and the Yippies went wild 
scoring the Freaks to victory. 

Several observers in the front of the 
room detected the orgiastic nature of the 

whole situation and proceeded to chant 
"We're having an orgy, we re having an 
orgy." Orgasm was apparently soon 
reached as the Yippies then wrote on the 
board . We are getting bored of this." The 
MFMC&PMC retreated and set up a new 
headquarters in the plaza where the USMC 
soon followed . The scene in the plaza 
rapidly developed into a creaming match 
and everybody quickly got tired and went 
back to bed. 

The U.S. Marines, who never go to bed , 
proceeded to 250 MC where they went 
about their recruiting with only minor 
interruption.

Change In Draft Status; 
No Cause For Alarm 

\l ober l Mill/' r 
' taff Itrit er 

Several UCSD student with a 1I-S draft classification for 
1970 have recently been re-classified to I-A status. This change 
in clas ification present no cause for alarm, since those 
affected all have safe lotlery numbers , chosen in the first 
lottery drawing, said Lance Beizer, UC D draft counselor. 

"The Selective Service is not as anxious to pursue the 
individual as in the past," said Beizer. 

A student is eligible for the lottery held during the year he 
turns 19. Availability for the draft occurs during the year the 
individual becomes 20 or I-A status. This can obviously occur 
simultaneolMJly. Lighten Ibe Load 

This move by the Selecti ve Service is designed to lessen their 
work load and to deplete the pool of available men. "The 
Selective Service has more appeals and paperwork to handle, 
and because of a depleted budget they have less people to 
handle business. The work load has also been increased by 
people playing games with their Boards such as sending in 
extraneous items to be included in their files ," said Beizer. 

The re-classified students vulnerability to the draft is not 
endangered by the change since all of their lottery numbers are 
above 195, considered safe by Selective Service director Curtis 
Tarr. 

"The influx of new manpower, mostly formerly deferred 
students, has really helped the situation to a standpoint where 
we think that it will be unnecessary to raise the ceiling on 
sequence numbers du rin~ the remainder of 1970. I think that 
the results this year justIfy the draft lottery system initiated 
by President Nixon," sa id Tarr in a recent Selective Service 
Newsletter. 

Man Power Pool 
The ere-classified students, if as expected are not chosen in 

1970. will-be placed in the Second Priority group for 1971. Thi s 
means their numberS will be called only after all 366 numbers 
for 1971 are used. The following year, 1972, they will be placed 
in the Third Priority group. This process is the same for 
everyone whose sequence number is determined by the lottery. 

1£ a student is classiried II-S, he must renew it annually for as 
long as he is scholastica lly eligible. Once the individual turns 24 
or graduates, the H-S is no longer good . The student will keep 
the lottery number assigned to him during the year he turns 19 
That number subsequently goes into eHect the year his II-S 
deferment ends. 

In another move, the Selective Service announced that 
anyone with a I-A classification who has not received notice to 
report for a physical postmarked by his 26th birthday is 
immune to any induction by the armed services. This policy 
regularizes what has been Selective Service practice for many 
years . Numbers CUI Down 

Beizer pointed out that these new policies demonstrate the 
cutdown in conscription . He cited figures showing that in 1969 
approximately 290,000 men were drafted , while in 1970 164 ,000 
men figure to enter into the armed services through the draf t. 

In future editions of the Triton Times, it is hoped that Lance 
Beizer will be able to answer questions regarding the draft 
submitted by those interested. Those wishing to provide 
questions should leave them in the TT of£ice at the south corner 
of Blake Hall, Revelle campus. These answers by Beizer will 
be included in a semi-regular article incorporating Beizer's 
replies and any other pertinent information concerning draft 
laws and regulations.

Five people. some of whom were college 
students were in an apartment listening to 
records with the music loud, and the lights low. 
Someone called the police. who arrived there 
hortly, pushing the five against the wall, 

shining flashlights in their eye. earching both 
the people and the apartment until one pulled 
out an orange card. One of the policemen read 
It, " Oh, LAW Fund , we 've heard about you , 
we ' re sorry ," and the police left shortly 
thereafter. 

The Legal Aid Warranty (LAW) Fund was 
formally presented to the AS Council last 
Thursday. Among other items discu sed at the 

ounci! meeting was the financial state of the 
Coffee Hut. and other AS snack bars, the Navy 
and Marine representatives coming to UCSD, a 
pos ~b~e. bussing service, the concert, and the 
pOSSibility that the Physical Education 
Department curriculum be eventually managed 
by student . 

The function of the LA W Fund was explained 
to AS Council members by Steve Pingree , a law 
student at Cal-Western. The LAW Fund 
essentially provides help for members who 
become . unexpectedly arrested . The 
membership fee is ten dollars a year. This sort 
of " jail insurance" isa comforting thing to have 
at the moment of arrest, for both you and the 
police realize that you are not alone. This aid is 
especially appropriate for minority and 
" unconventional looking" students, with whom 
police hara sment is most likely to occur. 

That the LAW Fund tries to do is to obtain 
release for the individual without bail , but if this 
cannot be accomplished the LAW Fund will 
attempt to arra nge bail as well as pay for the 
individual's first consu ltation with a 
coop rating attorney. 

As AS Pr sid nt , H avy Palcic explained , 
"Students have been intimidated into being 
arrested in the past" Students have to be aware 
of their civil rights. One of the functions of the 
LAW Fund is to educate members as to their 
civil rights, especially in respect to search and 
arr st. 

ntil re ently . th LAW Fund operated only in 
the Los Angel s and Orange Counties, but it is 
currently extending into an Di go County. 
Steve Pingree stated that. "The LAW Fund 
hasn' t made a big effort for m mbers until now, 
because they wanted to b certain they could 
provide services .. , 

Til LAW Fund has contact d both legal and 
law enfo.rcemenl agencie in San biego County 
as to their purpos . Many of th agenci have 
f It that LAW Fund isa " Long n cded rvic ." 

everyone out. At least, we can get a 
down to the jail right away." 

The AS Council will try to get this program 
the ground at UCSD through seminars, and 
volunteered help of students interested in law 

Steve Pingree was introduced by Allen Zink, 
the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, who 
himself is a lawyer. While Allen can not provide 
actual legal services, UCSD students who are in 
some difficulty can rap to him about where they 
are. Allen will then refer them to someone 
appropriate . 

Another item of business, discussed at the AS 
Council, concerned the tudent Legislative 
Program, essentially a student lobby 
Sacramento. 

Heavy observed that, "Many bills have been 
passed last year, concerni ng students, though 
there was essentially no student input 
concerning these issues. " The UC campuses. 
together will hire an executive director who will 
inform .the campuses as to the legislation 
concerning students. The campuses can then 
respond with their views. 

The student referendum, to be conducted the 
week of November 2, was also discussed by the 
AS Council. There will be three resolutions to be 
voted on : the AS Council will not pa s is ues of a 
pOlitical nature, the AS Council will oppose 
property damage by students, and finall y, no 
strike will be declared, until students have 
voted on it in an iniative election. 

With Jim Sills, and Shannon Shey helping, 
Mike Sheerin did muah of the work in 
circulating these petitions. Mike , a Revelle 
freshman, feels that waiting for the results of a 
student election before declaring a strik , "will 
act a buffering period, in which ra tional can bE 
obtained . " 

Since strikes tend to be of a sponta 
nature, when asked if the students would 
down enough to not wa nt to strike, Mike 
stating, " 1 assume we will never have a 
over an emotional outbreak ; if there is a 
it will be over omething concrete." Mike 
the referendums will pass because they are of 
moderate nature. 

On the other hand, Heavy observed that 
this campus, the AS has never forma 
declared a strike. Heavy feel s that 
referendums are " pretty mea ningl ss." 
he doesn 't disagree with their import, he 
. e what good they will do .

Wbat ever happened to tbe Street Journal, San Diego' 
above-ground underground ? If you were around the area this 
summer you might have noticed that the paper ea ed 
publlshmg for ~everal weeks. It re.vived recently, publishing a 
four-page speCial on Angela DaVIS. and a somewhat larger 
Issue a few weeks ago. 

If you look ~ I.oser at the recent issues you might also notice 
that the ~mbltlOus n~uckraking of last year that brought the 
paper national. publiCity, as well as harrassment and violence 
seems to be missing. ' 

Recent conversations with staff members, former and 
present, rev~al that the Street Journal ha s undergone some 
changes agam .. '· People started re-evaluating the paper and 
their relatIOnship with it," says Paula Tharpe. "They wanted 
to get mto other thmgs and to have time to think about what 
they were doing." 

Miss Th~rp.e is one of t.he members of the People 's Commune 
who IS sti ll mterested In publish ing the paper and she has gathe~ed .some additional staff members to help her. People 
who live m the Commune published the paper, but they have 
also been .lnvolved m several other projects and movements in 
the San Diego area. 

'New'S. J_ Will Relate to Young People 
The n.ew Street Journal will avoid extensive local 
m.uckrakl~g , at least of the old style. "From now on the paper 
Will ~ dlr~cted towa~d a d Lfferent purpose." Miss Tharpe 
says. It Will .relat.e di rectly to young peopl.e and issues that 
effect them , ltke Jim Pagni (local enterta inment promoter ). 
She adds that the paper will also print more national and 
international news. relating it to San Diego. 

According to Lowe~1 Be~gman , who played a major role in 
the paper from the time It changed its name from the Free 
Press to t~e Street . Jo~rnal , concurrently assuming a 

som~what dlff~rent editorial stance. the publicity the paper 
received from Its muckrakmg wa n't the important thing . " We 
never expected that by dOing thl muckraking we would put 

~he:re. people in jail. We just wanted to know who they were as 
indIVIduals: .. 

Ironically, Miss Tharpe, in stating that the paper wa n't 
reaching the right people (youth ). felt that the paper wa being 
read mainly by the businessmen themselves. "They wanted to 
see whom we would attack next. ·· 

The Street Jou.rnal's attacks were directed at several 
promment San Diego busine smen. Among them were : C. 
Arnoldt Smith, president of the Westgate California 

Corporation and a clo e personal friend of President Nixon' J~me C. Copley. owner of both daily newspaper in Sa~ 
Diego: and the Alessio brothers. who are local contractors . 

. S. J. Becomes Terrorists ' Target 
Durmg this period the Street Journal became the target of 

numerous ~cts of terrorism and harrassment. Their type-
setting equipment. equalling orne $4,000 worth of prop rty . 
was destroyed . Also , a staff m mber" car was firebombed . 
Th~ stafr. of course. draw parallels between th se acts and 
their muckraking activities. I 

They also draw parallels to numerous run-ins with the police. 
Their offices. and the house where the staff and others li ved 
(the Commu ne ). were kept under constant survei llance, and 
staff members were arrested frequently on various charges. 
fThe newspaper had trouble renting and even keeping an 

o Ice Owners. receiving death and bomb threats . often 
eVicted their tenants. ays Bergman : " Last March 1 tried to 
rent a. place at Third and Ma·rket. r paid the first and last 
month s rent. Three hours after we moved in an agent from the 
landlord came by and told us to vacate. Th owner had 
received a call." 
. The story of the Street Jou rnol, though, involves more than 
JU t the newspap r. The paper was just one of the projects 

operal~d by the People's Comm une. The ommune had a group 
of offices downtown which served as living quarters 
n wspap r office and a "People's Dry Goods Store. ,: 
Mov~ment for a Democratic Mili tary (MOM) , a group of 
servlcem nand cx-servicem n working for change within the 
armed for es. was also clo Iy affiliated with the ommun 
a nd had offices n a rby. 

At Its peak the ommun in Iud d me 25 person . Then 
came the StreelJou,no/ 'sevi tlon in January. and th P opl 's 

Dry Go?ds' in March. The ommune ha had trouble finding a 
house smce then. and have one now only because a friend put 
up the money to buy it. 

Commune ' Broke' 
The newspaper is currently using office space in the ew 
~dult . Community. As for the Commune. it has had 
~~na~clal problems before now. but according to Bergman, 

we re broke, really flat out. " ome are seeking employment 
and haVing a difficult time. " What do you say when they ask 
you for your last employer?" asks Bergman. 

The current situation seems to have left some of the 
Commune ~embers disillusioned. "The question I have." says 
Bergman, IS wh.ether San Diego i 10 t territory. There's no 
mass movement 10 San Diego now. and I wonder if it can ever 
reach the same scale as elsewhere." 

"Over the last 25 years the pOlice have slowly become more 
hostile to anyone who is under 25 and looks a little different. 
The amount of pressure they put on the community will 
probably gauge th.e r~sponse. San Diego has the distin tion of 
being the first city In which a local chapter of the Black 
Panthers was completely destroyed. Within a three week 
pen?<l the ~ollce systematically arrested Panthers 46 times on 
aU kinds of Insane charges." 

"Then th~re is the 9uestion of undercover agents. John Paul 
Murray (alia . Jay Klnll , admitted police agent ) violated the 
federal conspiracy statute by being in the same house with 
other undercover agents of the San Diego Police Dept. What 
you do at that pomt I outlined clearly in the Declaration of 
Independence. " 

The Street Journal will continue to be publi hed. but now on 
an every-other ~eek basis. Bergman, while not currently a 
staff membe.r. still sees the need for an information service to 
the commumty uch as the paper wa s providing. However. he . 
as well as some of the others in the Commune, feel that 
organIZIng thiS service in the form of a new paper has 
certainly been rough on the people doing it. and perhaps no 
longer worth the effort.

Opinion 

Revolutionaries, 
Jargon, and 
Conspiracy Theories 

Karl Keating 
Etymological devastation by the local paramilitarist ha 

never been a major threat to the campus. The gang of pseudo-
revolutionaries has yet to step boldly over the monosyllabic 
barrier which separates it frdm the rest of Academe. We have, 
in essence, no fear that any innocent young minds will be 
converted to radicalism by the beauty of the spoken word , 

Our dismay comes from acknowledging that relatively few 
students have become disenchanted with The Revolution 
because of its jejune vocabulary; this merely confirms the 
worst suspicions we harbor about the inadequacies of higher 
education. Somewhere, somehow, someone miserably 
neglected to give the present-day fellow travelers even the 
rudiments of political theory and jargon. 

The signpo ts on the leftist's political road are (surprise ! ) 
clustered at one extremity. We begin our journey through 
nether-nether land with the Infinitely-Distant Left, from there 
moving into Donald Kali sh Country (by Kalish's own 
admission, far left of the CPUSA's haunts>. We then pass 
through standard Radical pastures, followed by McCarthy 
Left-Liberal and Just Plain Liberal (H IIH 's area). Our next 
stop is Moderate , where our guide from the Mysterious Left 
leaves us; we are dependent upon our own resources to find the 
last outpost at the edge of the world: Fascist. 

With a political spectrum like this, one is, needless to say, 
somewhat handicapped in categorizing someone whose views 
lie between Moderate and Fascist. The Radical Chic may 
ea ily solve this problem by to sing a one- ided coin ; the 
resulting title is, every time, Fa ci t. One toss of the m tal 
di k. and the world is suddenly peopled by hundreds of millions 
of little Adolphs ( 0 the tory goeS) , each one with his own 
lIttle oven for frying unwary leftists 

Using such political labelling can be advantagous when one 
wants to promote a certain conspiracy theory. (Members of 
the far Left, like their counterpart Robert Welch, revel in 
conspiracy theories ; Welch once claimed that Eisenhower was 
a Communist, whereupon Russell Kirk produced the ideal 
rejoinder : " Eisenhower i n' t a Communist , he is a golfer". The 
current best-selling theory insists that Vice-President Agnew 
and his goons are trying to stir the Great Silent Majority into 
outright revolt ; Agnew presumably wants to use this mass of 
humanity to crush the revolutionaries. This theu y.like myriad 
similar to it. unfortunately has not the flimsiest foundation . 

Take it from one who is experienced in the game; until you 
are ca lled a fascist with such regularity that you feel no 
indignation. only pity for those who use the term-until then, 
you have no way of knowing why the Left could never achieve 
It utopian dreams. Creativi ty on the Left, like eloquence on 
the Left, is rare ; the Soviet bloc countries have not produced a 
major writer in fifty years, save those few, like Pasternake, 
who have broken from the mental regimentation. As Czeslaw 
Milosz so aptly notes. the revolutionary mind is warped, the 
flame of individuality in the writer extinguished. The 
collectivist atmosphere . warns Milosz, i bad : " It is an aura of 
trength and unhappiness. of internal paralySiS and external 

mobility.' , 
The revolutionary mind today differs from those of Bukharin 

or Rykov or Kamenev primarily In ophistication . Underlying 
ideologies remain basically the same, though the nihilism 
quotient ha grown . Perhaps Lenin's advice would be valuable 
to the etymologically defiCient young radicals : " Luch he

Still No PerDlanent 
Child Day Care Center 

Women's Liberation Front 

The Women's Liberation Front at UCSD 
began providing day dare for children three 
years old and younger during the week of April 
13, 1970. Every weekday afternoon the children, 
under the supervision of parents and members 
of WLF,enjoyed the company of interested 
adults and of children their own age . The 
"center" had no building - we met on the 
plaza, in people 's homes, and in the commons 
rooms of married student housing, until we 
finally worked out an arrangement with a pre-
school that wa renting a campus dormitory and 
allowed us to share their facilities. 
Simultaneously with our pilot project, we began 
trying to find a permanent structure on campus. 

We spoke to George Murphy who insisted that 
we work with Lynn Naibert, then Dean of 
Student Affairs. 

Naibert sent us to Anton Wille , who was 
responsible for planning and space allocation. 
Witte suggested we use the Pump House, 610 
MC for our day care center. We toured the 
building with Naibert, and asked him to request 
that the necessary improvements be made. 

We then spoke with Al Rea of Environmental 
Health and Design. Rea assured us that a state 
license would not be nece sary if we met his 
improvement requirements. We needed a fence 
for the yard, a tile floor , and a toilet. 

Dean Nalbert requested a cost e timate for 
the needed renovation . A month later. we 
received the estimate. [t had several faults. 

1. It was not itemized, 
2_ The cost of plumbing wa not included ince 

Dean aibert had decided, unilaterally , that it 
would be prohibitive. 

3. The cost of asbestos tiling wa s included, but 
the labor of laying the tile was to be left to us, 
an economy measure devised by Dean Naibert. 

4. The estimate covered, in addition to the 
co t of tiles, the cost of constructing a partition 
and hating the nap area. 

Opinion 

The yard work was begun with the 
cooperation of John Carroll of Architects and 
Engineers who filled in the yard with dirt for 
free . 

In July Naibert as ured us that Student 
Affairs had allocated the building to us. 

In August he said that we did not have the 
building. Third College had priority over it (and 
had had that priority all along) and we would 
have to peak with them . 

As it turned out, Third College let us have the 
Pump House , but it was a delay of several 
weeks and a t no time were we allowed to present 
our case in person. 

In August Dean Naibert told us that: 
1. the most probahle source of money was 
Associated Students. of which the President's 
Discretaionary Fund was available during the 
summer. 
2, the need for plumbing could be circumvented 
3. we could always move to building 711 if a 
toilet proved essential. 

As it turned out , 711 was the only building 
specifically legally ruled out as a possible child 
care facility . Also, the need for toirets could not 
be circumvented and we are still trying to gct 
the money, 

We decided to request funds from the 
Registration Fees Committee, Murphy insi ted 
that he would get the proper costestimates. 
Finally the ommitt e met; we were requested 
not to attend. Murphy did not present the 
reque t for funds for the day care center at this 
meeting, nor did any other group asking for 
money have to go through the rigmarole of 
getting the official co t e timate that WLF did . 

We are providing day care temporarily in the 
commons r om at married student housi ng 
while waiting for the next meeting of the 
Registration Fees Committee to reach a 
decision on the allocation of funds. 

Neighborhood 
Douse 

Eduardo Ruiz Davila 
There is a small two-story building I would 

like to tell you about. It has a fifteen foot high 
rusting fence around the adjacent playground to 
it. There is barbed-wire strung all along the top 
of the fence to keep the kid ' of the local 
communi ty from Climbing over the fence to 
play in the playground in the evening. The name 
of this building is - "The Neighborhood 
House . " 

You may be wondering at this point what the 
significance of this building is? To the more 
affluent sectors of thi s society Neighborhood 
1I0use i probably of no significance, but to the 
Chicanos of the Logan Heights barrio it means a 
lot. It meant enough to the grandparents of the 
children in that barrio to lead a take over of that 
building and fire all the previous staff. 

What could have possibly enraged these 
people enough to do something that has been 
always associated only with students? The 
"sleeping giant" that all convict talk about in 
the prisons got up t and did a little bit of 
grumbling. 

At this point I think it would be good to give a 
little bit of the history of Neighborhood House. 
The eighborhood House in Logan Heights was 
the first of ven uch buildings in San Diego, 
being built in 1912. It used to s rve the needs of 
the community by providing activities and a 
mectlng place for people of all ages. As one man 
pointed out, " wh n my father used to fini sh 
working in the fi sh cannery he would go to th ' 
Neighborhood 1I0u and take a show r. We 
didn 't hay a show r or bath in our hou ' and It 
would only cost him a nirk I for a tow I to dry 
him If Th n h would stand outside and talk to 
hiS friends for about ah hour and go home." 
Another person was hard to say, "wh n I was a 
kid we used to hav all sort~ of ('tivltles here 
Some of the best tennis players in Sa n Diego, 
some of the b st athl tes in San Diego us d to 

play here. ow my kids have no place to go and 
play except the streets. I always thought 

cighborhood House would go on like always." 
In 1963 a new staff director was appointed . It 

was to mark the beginning of the downfall. 
Programs and activities were slowly done away 
with , While funds for the programs were being 
cut for " lack of funds, " staff salaries were 
going-up. The barbed-wire went up and the 
lights went out early, The coach was relieved of 
his post and the playground wa allowed to fall 
apart. Slowly eighborhood House was turned 
into an administrative center for the other six 
buildings. The new director did not take into 
account the needs, feelings or wishes of the 
people she had been hired to serve. 

So after ven years of mismanagement the 
p ople decided to take back what was rightfully 
theirs . Large stores of food were discovered in 
the kitch ns. it wa' given to the needy people 
who had been turned a way because there was 
" nothing available."

Proposition 18 

or Asphyxiate 
I noticed a minority 

editorial in the TT this week 
urging a .. 0" vote on 
proposition 18 (which would 
set aside funds to fight air 
poilu tion) be ca use the 
individual respon ible for 
poluting are not those who 
would pay the taxes to fight 
it. Conseq uently , the 
argument went, we should put 
the burden on the auto or oil 
industry (or both ). 

If this individual intends to 
wait for a propo ilion to tax 
the auto-oil complex, he will 
asphyxiate tir t. Even if such 
a propo ition hould come 
before us and be passed , the 
corporations will not pay 
anything a t a II. They pass the 
bills onto the consumers in 
the form of higher prices, 
Moreover, the individuals 
who run the corpora tions 
(and who are really 
responsible for perpetuating 
the ale of gas and car. 
which the consumer is forced 
to buy as the only practical 
mode of tra nsporta lion 
available ) have guaranteed 
salaries and will never be 
penalized . 0 all we 
accompli h by waiting for 
a nother and " better" 
proposition i to postpone our 
paying for the mess these 
companies have caused . And 
further procra tina lion only 
exacerbates the ituation. 
(Already thousands of LA 
residents have been and are 
leaving the LA BaSin on 
medical advice because of 

respiratory problems 
connected with air pollution. ) 

If we don 't pay. we will all 
choke. So don 't be fooled by 
the quixotic Adam Smiths 
who might argue (and I've 
heard it done ) that the auto-
oil complex will soon realize 
that air pollution is 
unprofitable (and mend their 
ways ), because they will 
eventually kill off their 
consumers. That's bullshit. 
They will find sufficient 
compensation in their profits 
and deny to the last breath 
that they cau e pollution. 
They will deny that people 
have to buy cars. (Even 
though you starve without a 
job, and most people don 't 
Ii ve close enough to work to 
u e an alternate form of 
transporta tion) , Ciga rettes 
might kill people, but tobacco 
companies will never 
withdraw them from the 
market. There is too much 
profit in it. 

VVe cannot afford to reject 
proposition 18 because we ' re 
paying for something we 
houldn·t. We 'll pay for it 

anyway. We don 't live in a 
land where moral 
responsibility is properly 
assessed. We live in a land 
where profits are made on 
misleading advertising, false 
labelling, adulterated and 
contaminated products, on 
enriched bread that is as 
nutritious a sawdust. If you 
want to wait for justice , then 
you 're waiting for the La t 
Judgement.

Experimental Theatre at UCSD 
Theatre. like all fine art forms. is a process of excitement. 

experiment. and change. The Anomaly Factory bring the 
excitement of evolutionary theatre within the US D 
community. 

The Factory has lwo theatre companies. The Environmental 
Theatre and the Street Theatre. The Environmental Theatre 
completely rejects traditional theatrical trapings such as 
script and dialogue. and attempts to communicate to the 
audience through imagery. 

The lighting and sound are computer controlled to ('reate a 
complete physical environment. Multichannel sound is used to 
create the effect of three dimensional hearing. The shape and 
size of the room are distorted and controlled by the light and 
sound . The performer is trained to be completely flexible in 
terms of movement and voice. The main method of 
communication is pantomime. 

Actual cripts for the plays are never written down. But , 
notes and description of past performances have been kept. 

The Street Theatre communicates to people on a social and 
political level. A great deal of research goes into the creation 
of each play. Each performance. however, is timely and 
usually performed on one to three days notice. 

The Street Theatre is presently re earching for a play about 
the 201 anniversary of San Diego. It will include items about 
the recent arrest of San Diego Ci ty Council member. 
Women 's Liberation. and other items of timely intere t . . 

The Environmental Theatre WIll present its first major 
project in January or February. A horter non-technical piece 
will be presented in ovember. It will deal primarily in 
movement and mime. 

For those who are interested in Experimental Theatre but do . 
not have enough time to devote to productions. there are open 
work hops on Thursday. Friday, and Saturday from 2 until 5 
pm. The work hops are c1asse in mime, dance, and other 
theatre techniques.

Rugby, like the re t of the 
world , was not without conflict 
this year. There were riots in 
England to greet the touring 
South Africa team due to their 
country's apartheid policies. 
The ew Zealand national team 
refused to go to South Africa 
unless full human rights were 
granted to their Maori players. 
New Zealand prevailed . To top 
it off the Fijian national team 
had quite a controversy with 
E nglish referees at a 
tournament over their 
interpretation of infractions 
like biting, scratching, and ear 
pulling.

and hatred breeds VICIOUS 
resentment. But is this 
message new? Is it presented 
in a new way? I think not, and 
for this reason "Joe" must be 
consigned to that growing pile 

The lesson "Joe" teaches is 
that, like He ll er's 22nd CatCh, 
"They can do anyth ing we 
ca n't stop 'em from doing. " 
To stop further "Joe 's", both 
on the screen and in rea l life, 
students should become more 
involved in both workers' 
struggles and women 's 
libera tion . If these 
movements reach their 
deserved fruition, there will 
be no more need or demand 
for films like "Joe."

Water Polo 

Watermen to take 
on Complex Cal Tech 

by Elma Noah 

Tomorrow. Wednesday. will 
mark the third time within a 
weeks time that the UCSD polo 
team (water. not pony ) has seen 
action. The Tri tons will play 
their second home game of the 
eason, being pitted against Cal 

Tech, a team which they have 
yet to beat. Cal Tech will 
undoubtedly throw it right back 
at them with a highly complex 
def ense designed by super 
spectator and UCSD Fluid 
Mechanics major Bob Skelly. 

If the Triton should pull it off 
it will double their perfect home 
stand record of 1-0 which came 
as a resul t of a 9-8 rout of 
Redlands Wednesday last. 
Those who were in the area of 
the UCSD pond that day could 
not help but get caught up in the 
excitement of the come from 
behind victory. The Tritons 
showed orne brilliant flashes of 
a tarnished past b} coming out 
and jumping out to a I) deficit. 

This clever strate!;. devi ed 
by Coach Becker to get 
Redlands over-confident and 
relaxed in the end worked out 
almost to the plit econd After 
the first quarter the game 
evened out to find Redlands still 
up by 3. 8-5, at the end of 3 
periods, the Tritons picking up 
one . but the ref we re 
undoubtedly coring th e 
heaviest. 

In the fourth quarter the 
zebra hirted guy fell asleep. 
which IVa the cue for UCSD to 
wake up. With two minutes left 
though , • D was still on the 
six end of an 8-6 core. Howard 
lIunt was heard to mumble 
something about needing more 
wheaties. and most of the 
spectator were now thinking 
more of recreational swim than 
a victory. Then somehow in the 

next minute and a half U . SD 
managed to score two goals and 
break the clock. With the game 
and the time piece restarted 
Jim toner stole some trunks 
then the ball, passed it to 
somebody (who might have 
been Mark I who in turn cleverly 
aced the goalie by banking a 
hot off a Redlands player with 8 

seconds remaining. The fans 
went wild . Redland s went 
home. the Coach went to the 
bathroom, and the San Diego 
Union howed their usual 
support by wanting to know who 
the high scorer for Redlands 
was. 

All in all it was not a bad 
game . The defensive wa 
aggressive , the offen e 
creative , John O'Connel 
managed a shot or two from the 
Hole (not to be confused with 
the drain 1. and Jim toner kept 
the Triton gimp treak alive by 
mi sing another penally hot. 
Let' hear it for JIm 

If you ml ed th e 
breathtaking actIOn last week. 
well here's vour chance to make 
up for It. Game time Wednesday 
is 4:00 p.m .. so come and bring 
a friend . or enemy. and do come 
early as seats are sca rce and 
tho e left standIng may be put 
in if the Tri ton are pl aYing
