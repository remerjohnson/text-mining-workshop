CGIDr: Mike Fioumey performs at the B-Boy Battle, one of the events at this year's Students of Color Conference 
held Friday through Sunday in the Price Center. 

Students of Color Convene 
L.A. Symphony and Medusa perform at Conference 
By ALEX J. LIE 
Associate News Editor 

A record 300 students participated this 
weekend in the 12th annual "Students of 
Color Conference: Politics of Silence 
Establishing a Voice at the Crossroads of the 
New Millennium: which was hosted by the 
A.S. Council in cooperation with the UC 
Student Association. 

Students from various schools were in 
attendance during the three-day event, 
including members from all of the UC cam-
puses, some California State University cam-
puses and some high schools. Among the UC 
campuses, Davis and Riverside had the high-
est number of attendees. 

UC Santa Cruz junior David Harl1augh 

explained his motivation for making the long 
commute to attend the conference. 

"My motivation as a white ally was to learn 
my role as one: Harbaugh said. "[ wanted to 
be more familiar with the struggle and [ think 
the people [in the conference! have been real-
ly open in trying to educate themselves and 
learn their role, as well. n 

Co-Chair of the SOCC Committee Nneka 
Udoh said she heard only good things about 
the conference. 

"[t was extremely organized: Udoh said. "[ 
think this conference in San Diego totally set 
a precedent - not to say the ones in the past 
weren't successful, because they were. It's just 
that this year we had so many people:

All-Campus 
Commencement 
Date Finalized 
Campus facilities prepare 
for Dr. Patch Adams 
By CARLAN WENDLER' 
Contributing News Write! 

The date and plans for this year's com-
mencement were finalized this week as seniors 
graduating this June prepare to participdtc in 
all-campus commencement ceremonies and 
college graduation rites on the sa me day for 
the first time in recent history. 

The three graduate programs will conclude 
earlier in June, whereas the five undergrad uate 
colleges will hold their events on Sunday, June 
17, along with a campus-wide ceremony on 
RIMAC field . Previously, the five colleges had 
events spread across a weekend and only in 
recent years have all-campus ceremonies been 
held. 

This year's speaker will be Dr. Patch Adams, 
best known by Robin Williams' portrayal of his 
holistic approach to medicine in the 1998 film 
bearing his name. Students may remember 
that last year's all -campus ceremony had to be 
canceled at the last minute, as Maya Angelou 
unexpectedly faced 'double knee surgery. 
Previous speakers have included then -
President Bill Clinton in 1997 and House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1998. ... 

A.S. President Doc Khaleghi and Festivals 
Coordinator Scott Mantell have pursued 
speakers and worked on invitation letters since 
last summer in an attempt to secure a keynote 
speaker for the all-campus event. One of the 
first on the list was Adams. 

"All-campus commencement has always 
been a tenuous ceremony," Kaleghi said. 
"Securing support from the adm inistration 
was difficult, and we had a limited time to pub-
licize it." 

Over the summer the A.S. Council worked 
to make certain the chancellor and provosts 
supported the idea. After acquiring their back-
ing, the Council had until Dec. 31 to acquire a 
speaker. They met this deadline, and Adams 
has committed in writing to giving the com-
mencement address.

Student Regent Visits UCSD, Discusses Admissions 
Tracy Davis attends luncheon to discuss the 
benefits and difficulties of her job 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

Student Regent-designate 
Tracy Davis visited UCSD 
Thursday to talk to potential stu-
dent regent candidates at a lun-
cheon concerning the application 
process. 

The luncheon took place in the 
Faculty Club Thursday morning. 
Davis spoke to six applicants and a 
few other spectators about the dif-
ficulties of the application process 
and the responsibilities of student 
regent. 

Applications for the position 
are due in the chancellor's office 
Feb. 23 by 5 p.m. These aprHca-
tions are for the position 0 stu-

dent regent-designate for 2001-
2002 and student regent for 2002-
2003. 

Davis is the student regent-
designate for 2000-2001 and will 
be student regent next year. 

Students from all UC campus-
es are eligible to apply. Student 
regents in the past have been 
undergraduate and graduate stu-. 
dents alike. 

Davis is a graduate student at 
UCLA. She received her bachelor's 
degree in 1995 from UCLA. She 
moved to New York City and 
worked for CNN in the investiga-
tive documentary department 
before moving back and becoming

socc: 
Approximately 300 
students were in attendance 
Continued from page 1 

Jesse Coward, a member of the 
SOCC Committee, agreed. 

"It ran very smoothly," Coward 
sa id. "The amount of work and energy 
put into it really paid off." 

Udoh said the high turnout rate 
was a surprise for everyone involved. 
According to her, this year's student 
participation is a significan t increase 
from last year's number of approxi-
mately 60 students. 

Before the conference, Co-Chair of 
the SOCC Committee Alicia Schwartz 
talked about her goals for the three-
day event. 

"My big hope is that people will get 
something from this when they leave," 
Schwartz said. "After a conference like 
thi s, it makes you think of what you 
really have - you realize just how 
privileged you are." 

The conference's first major event 
on Friday was "The Arena," a con-
cert/dance/an exhibit featuring L.A. 
Symphony and Medusa. 

Events sponsored by the confer-
ence on Saturday included an opening 
speech from Hughes Suffren of 
Claremont-McKenna College, work-
shops on issues including rally organi-
za tion, va rious caucuses including 
multiple identities and a rally and 
march with the coalition of Justice for 
Janitors and Bus Riders' Union. The 
evcning's activities included a banquet 
fea turing professor George Lipsitz of 
the UCSD department of ethnic stud-
ies as keynote speaker, and the play 
"The Vagina Monologues." 

"He touched me deeply," said 
Kevin Du, a UC Davis junior, about 
Lipsitz's speech. "He talked so pas-
sionately that it made me passionate." 

Sunday, the final day of the confer-
ence, wrapped up with more work-
shops, caucuses addressing women 
and queers of color, a panel discussion 
enti tled "The Changing Face of 
Activism " and finally, a large group 
session. 

Arash Kolahi, a Marshall senior, 
said he liked how the conference 
ended. 

"It ends on a positive note," Kolahi 
sa id. "Speakers talk about solutions 
and success stori es." 

II..S. Vice President External 
Eugene Mahmoud praised the confer-
ence and its panicipants but wondered 
why more people did not attend, par-
ticularly more members of the admin-
istration. 

"It's interesting when something is 
student-initiated like this conference, 
Chancellor Dynes, who has deemed 
himself chief executive officer of diver-
sity, or something to that effect, is not 
here," Mahmoud said. 

Udoh shared his sentiment. 
"Honestly, I wish more people from 

UCSD could be here: Udoh said. "I 
wish Joseph Watson and Chancellor 
Dynes were here. They should totally 
use this as a resource." 

UC Riverside senior and External 
Vice President Ryann Nieves men-
tioned how she thought th is year's 
conference was better than the ones 
before. 

"This is my third year at the con-
ference, and this year has three times 
as many students who are just more . 
willing to listen and dialogue," Nieves 
said. "Touchy subjects usually bring 
negative connotations, but I've seen 
people [this year[ really be open to 
make it a positive situation." 

Nieves went on to commend the 
San Diego staff for hosting the event 
so smoothly. 

UCLA junior Greg Hom said one of 
the goals of participants was to network. 

"A lot of connections were made 
that were really imponant: Hom said. 
" I definitely met a lot of people, which 
is sort of the theme of this conference 
- unity of struggle." 

Mahmoud said most of the credit 
should be given to Co-Chairs Udoh 
and Schwartz. 

Udoh expressed her thanks to all 
the SOCC staff, including a special 

t~anks to Tom Colley, UCSD opera-
!tons manager of the University 
Centers.

Author Ruth Morgan-Jones 
to Appear at UCSD Bookstore 

Ruth Morgan·Jones will make an appearance 
at the UCSD Bookstore on Feb. 28 at 5 p.m. to 
discuss her book, titled "Hearing Differently: An 
Investigation into the Impact of Hearing Loss on 
Family Life.·

views with hearing·impaired people and looks at 
how their disability has altered their relation-
ships. Morgan·Jones is hearing·lmpaired herself 
and used her experience on the subject as Inspi· 
ration to write the book. 

The book finds a positive outlook on the topic 
by drawing from various fields of study, Including 
social psychology, family sociology and linguis-
tics to discover means hearing·impaired people 
use consciously and unconsciously in every day 
interaction such as conflict management and 
communication. For more information about the 
event, call (858)534-3149. 

Brain Impairment Discovered 
In Female Alcoholics 

Researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine 
and the Veteran 's Affairs Health Care System 
have used fMRI studies to confirm that alco-
holism negatively affects memory in young, 

Would you 
.you think ca~~ 

female alcoholics. Previously, only thinking and 
memory tests were used to test the theory. 

The researchers published their findings in 
the February Issue of "Alcoholism: Clinical & 
Experimental Research." 

Susan F. Tapert, who works as an assistant 
adjunct professor of psychiatry at UCSD and as 
a clinical psychologist at the Veteran's Affairs 
Health Care System, headed the research, which 
employed functional magnetic reasoning for the 
first time to study the brains of female alco-
holics. 

Women 18 to 25 years old were tested in 
order to discover the importance of studying the 
impaired brain parts individually to see how early 
alcoholism leads to brain damage. 

The researchers are planning to do more 
studies with men and women to determine 
whether memory loss can improve with absti· 
nence from alcohol or whether it is permanent.

4 OPINION The VCSD Guardian Tuesday, February 20, 2001 

The advantages of living off campus outweigh the benefit 
of being close to classes 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Don't you off-campus residents love 
meeting freshmen every year? There's a 
particular gleam in their eyes, a certain 
thrilled-to-be-alive voracity as they 
recount to you their exciting tales of res-
idence hall life in tones dripping with 
reverence. You listen and smile and nod, 
but you probably feel smug, because 
you know that you have the better deal. 
It 's a fact: Those who live off campus 
may not always have it easier, but they 
have it better by far in many ways. 

The one thing that makes everything 
else easy about living off campus is the 
ability to choose one's living compan-
ions. The importance of this oft-over-
looked blessing cannot be understated; 
if you live with compatible people, near-
ly everything else will fall into place. liv-
ing with the right people makes things 
fun, relaxing, free from hassle and 
makes life conducive to studying and 
productivity, should you choose to 
engage in such anomalous behavior. 

Sometimes I feel quite certain that 
the colleges' residential life staffs match 
roommates up by a process whose sci-
entific credibility seems roughly on par 

with that of Teiresias' reading of bird 
auguries. Though I have .known several 
people who have met their closest 
friends through their roommates, [ 
know many more who endured the hell 
of living with an utterly mismatched 
personality and turned out all the more 
scarred for it. 

My on-campus housing experience 
left me with severed friendships, a 
seething hatred for all Warren college 
residential life staff and a paralytic, 
though somewhat founded, fear of 
being run over by a particular ex-room-
mate shuttle driver. That, however, is a 
story for another day. 

In all but a few situations, living off 
campus affords one the freedom to 
choose one's living companions, the 
importance of which cannot be under-
estimated. You will never understand 
what it can mean to choose the people 
you room with until you have been 
assigned to live with a tactless nympho-
maniac, a Tijuana-bound partygoer who 
cannot hold her alcohol, a Limp Bizkit-
blasting pothead or - far worse than 
any of the above - someone who steals 
your toiletries. (And you wondered

Sophomores should battle for scarce on-campus housing 
for its lqw cost and proximity to classes 
Staff Writer 

With the influx of rowdy fresh men 
invading UCSD next year, fu ture sopho-
mores have to seriously question 
whether clawing and fighting for spaces 
in on-campus housing that can only 
accommodate 35 percent of second-
year students next year is worth it. 

After all, not only will the chosen 
sophomores have to tolerate living next 
to 'hordes of inconsiderate freshmen 
and try in vain to study over the frosh 
parties, you will also be in a state of 
limbo until early April as you put up 
with housing lotteries, waiting lists and 
Survivor-like maneuvers to positi'on 
yourselves in an apa rtment with exactly 
four (Qr five, if you're a Muiron) people 
with whom you can share your hovel 
without maiming anyone, 

That was probably a lousy opening 
to an artic le describing the benefits of 
on-campus housing, but at the end of 
the day, if you make it through the 
tribulations that procuring on-campus 

housing requires, there are more than 
enough incentives to pay the UC 
Regents even more money than you 
~lready do fo r tuition for-the sweet priv-
Ilege of staking out a claim in the con-
crete blocks more commonly known as 
"on-campus apartments: 

Perhaps money is a good topic to 
start off with. It is an undeniable fact of 
college life that everything boOs dOlVn to 
money. Some may argue that it all boils 
?own to alcohol, but the two are readily 
Interchangeable, especially with all those 
impressionable freshmen you will be liv-
II1g near next year. 

The UCSD Housing and Dining 
Services Web site estimates that living in 
the apartments next year will cost 
approximately $4,500, scaled up or 
down a tad for a single or double room. 
For nine months, that boils down to 
$500 a month, an incredible deal wlien

Unsavory Ties Connect Bush, BJU 
Speak UPt 

Spook Out! 

I n last year's presidential election, George W Bush was quick to say that the 
Republican Party was filled with 
compassionate conservatism and 
was the true party of inclusive-
ness. Yet, how does the Republi-
can Party reconcile that promise 
of inclusiveness with their cele-
brated relationship with Bob 

Jones University, a university 
known for its racial and religious 
intolerance? 

That Bush visited and spoke 
at the university during the pres-
idential race exposes how 
uncommitted he is to what he 
preaches, for his mere presence 
speaks volumes of his acceptance 
of the university'S discriminatory 

polici~s. 
At the time that Bush visited 

the Christian fundamentalist 
university, interracial dating and 
marriage were explicitly prohibit-
ed to Bob jones students. In 
addition, Bob jones University 
has displayed intolerance toward 
Catholics and Mormons. 

Even with these blatantly 
racist and intolerant policies, 
Bush made it a priority to stop at 
the university during his cam-
paign to give a speech. It was 
made evident through his mere 
presence that all his touted 
beliefs of a new inclusive GOP 
were nothing more than a facade 
donned to win the trust of the 
American people and the coveted 

office ofrresident. 
All 0 Bush's preaching of a 

more racially inclusive party is no 
more than a temporary and 
superficial face-lift, for racial 
intolerance still remains at the 
core of the Republican Party. 

The fact that Bob jones Uni-
versity is a frequent stop for con-
servative politicians is evidence 
of this power. For example, when 
U.S. Attorney General john 
Ashcroft was still a senator, he 
spoke at the university'S com-
mencement ceremony and 
earned an honorary degree. 

It is clear that a politician 
must woo Bob jones' extremists 
as a rite of passage of acceptance 
into conservative power. So the 
question that remains is this: just 
how inclusive is the Republican 
Party if they readily embrace their 
relationship with Bob jones Uni-
versity? 

We can only deem the actions 
of President Bush and Attorney 
General Ashcroft as an accep-
tance of the university'S bigoted 
policies. 

To be fair to Bush, he did 
apologize for not talting the 
opportunity while speaking at 
the university to address his dif-
ference of opinion with the 
school's policy toward racial and 
religious intolerance. 

In a letter to Cardinal O'Con-
nor, Bush wrote that his appear-
ance at Bob jones University was 
a "missed opportunity causing 
needless offense, which I deeply 
regret: 

Yet interestingly enough, 
Bush did not apologize for 
going to the university in the 
first place. This deafening omis-
sion on his part leaves the door 

Noon-1 :30 

open for more visits, thus secur-
ing the extremist religious con-
servative base of the Republican 
Party. 

That is how Bush success-
fully neutralized john McCain's 
threat to his candidacy for pres-
ident last year by securing the 
all-powerful conservative base. 

'The old cliche that actions 
speak louder than words is aptly 
applied to Bush. He speaks of 
being racially inclusive, yet he 
overtly caters to the extremist 
and bigoted base of his party. 

It does not add up. In my 
mind, Bush is like a little boy 
who only apologizes for stealing 
a cookie after he is caught with 
his hand in the jar. But in 
Bush's case, he only apologized 
after he was caught in a blatant 
case of hypocrisy because of the 
media frenzy surrounding his 
visit. 

Bush's appearance at Bob 
jones University completely 
drones out his political rhetoric 
of inclusiveness and "compas-
sionate conservatism." 

That the Republican Party 
still cultivates and embraces its 
connection to Bob jones Univer-
sity and its extremist base of sup-
port is nothing short of political 
suicide. 

Though a fluke made Bush 
president, the Republican Party's 
lOner fragmentation and 
hypoaisy toward racial inclusion 
Win be its undoing and political 
power will be lost. 

All it taltes is enough fed-up 
people to force those extremist 

bi~ots into extinction, thus sev-
enng this unsavory connection 
with Bob jones University once 
and for all .

Two Koreas Must 
Reunify Gradually 
Divergent paths taken by two countries leads 
to seperation of families and belief systems 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Talks of an imminent reunifica-
tion have been rampant and indeed 
seem inevitable in light of recent 
developments in the two Koreas. 

First, there were the numerous 
family reunions among dozens of 
relatives who had had no communi-
cation since the Korean War. 

Next came the historic summit 
last june between leaders of South 
and North Korea, signaling a new 
era in Korean political relations. 
During the summit, the leaders 
agreed on a number of things, 
induding allowing reunions 
between war-tom families and pro-
moting closer economic ties, in the 
hopes that these actions would lead 
to an eventual reunification. To date, 
about 7.6 million South Koreans -
15 percent of the population - have 
relatives in the North whom they 
haven't seen since the end of the 
war. 

Indeed the meeting was unprece-
dented. A Korean scholar and for-
mer Russian diplomat who was 
posted in Pyongyang in the late '80s 
called it a "landmark event in Kore-
an history, tantamount to putting a 
symbolic end to the Korean War." 

Although reunification appears 
to be inevitable in the long run, the 
transition will and should take much 
longer. In other words, don't expect 
the two Koreas to become one any 
time soon. 

Essentially, an attempt at reunifi-
cation is an attempt at marrying two 
very different creatures. Ever since 
the start of the Korean War on June 

25, 1950, the two sides have been at 
odds with each other. Intense fight-
ing lasted nearly three years between 
North and South Korea. The three-
year fighting between the South, 
backed by the United Nations. and 
the North, backed by China and the 
Soviet Union, cost the lives of 
approximately 2.4 million Koreans. 

Bitter from old wounds and a 
tenuous truce that ended the war. 
the two Koreas have maintained 
their separation for 50 years. In fact , 
the two are still technically at war: 
the creation of a guarded demilita-
rized zone and the fact that each is 
still heavily armed is a testament to 
this. 

Within the passing of that half 
century, both countries have taken 
very different paths. The North 
embraced a communist dictatorship 
with Kim 11 Sung at the helm. For 
years, it remained an isolated coun-
try, struggling from decades of being 
cut off from modern technology. 
only now facing the effects in the 
form of starvation and poverty. Kim 
imposed a Korean form of Stalinism 
that raised his persona to that of cult 
status, reminiscent of China's Mao 
Tse-Tung. With the death of Kim, 
the North has continued to 
encounter severe economic prob-
lems. Put simply, the North needs 
help. 

The South, on the other hand. 
has enjoyed much greater luck 
since the great divide. It has 
evolved into a capitalist democracy 
that has made its mark as a viable 
manufacturing force, playing a

Pro: 
More opportunities are 
available outside UCSD 
continued hom ...,. 4 
where all your Pantene was going.) 

Surprisingly, if done right, living 
off campus can be much cheaper 
than livi ng in the residence halls. In 
terms of a si mple cost-benefit 
analysis, living off campus opens a 
window of oppol1unity that on-
campus life si mply cannot provide. 

It's true that UCSD students do 
nOt live in an area known for its 
student-fr iendly rent costs and 
infras tructure. The only worse 
place to put a college that I can 
think of is Walnut Creek, Calif. 
However, those who scour the 
housing market with diligence will 
be rewarded. Your housing costs 
on campus will get you a furnished . 
cubicle, an Ethernet connection 
slowed by everyone else's apster 
downloads and the unique oppor-
tunity to experience a variety of 
tacky, RA-concocted bonding ses-
sions. All th is, and you might have 
to share your 150 square feet with 
twO or three other people. 

In contrast, many off-campus 
residents will tell you they know 
people living 10 minutes fro m 
campus paying less than $500 a 
month for their own bedrooms. It's 
true that living off campus means 
you must cart your own furniture 
from home or buy it new, but at 
least you can be guaranteed that 
your bed was never host to a wild 
night of body shots during the 
1996 Sun God Festival. And, going 
on the assumption that you are liv-
in:; off ,'1 '!l PUS with people you 
know and trust relatively well , you 
can ta ke for granted that your 
roommate won 't bring her new 
Internet boyfr iend home to conse-
crate your Ikea breakfas t nook se t. 

The most freq uent complaint of 
those who live off campus is about 

the commute. UCS D has no reli-
able parking, and San Diego has no 
reliable public transportation . Well , 
what were you expecting? If you 
want to see efficient mass transit in 
action, you'll need to go to school 
in someplace like Belgium. Anyone 
who expects an easy time out of the 
commute to campus is in for 
another thought, but anyone not 
prepared to endure a Iinle hardship 
needs to be forced to spend a 
semester at Downtown Barstow 
College to see how truly paradisia-
ca l a San Diego student has it in 
nearly all facets of life. 

What else do on-campus resi-
dents have that I can tear into? The 
one thing that comes to mind that's 
hard to contest is their ability to 
rise and lope to a class 20 minutes 
before it starts. While that is fun for 
the fi rst quarter or so, after that it 
becomes downright decadent. I too 
enjoyed waking up at 7:55 a.m. to 
scamper off to that 8 a.m. Warren 
Writing section, but self-i ndul-
gence can only go so fa r. One of 
these days, you're going to have a 
job that starts just as early as the 
earl iest class, and it won't allow you 
to stay up unt il 4 a.m. playing net-
worked Age of Empires, only to 
stumble out five minutes before 8 
a.m. in your rubber ducky pajamas 
with a cowlick that would put Den-
nis the Menace to shame. Good 
habits are acquired through prac-
tice, not natural genius. and every-
one needs to start practicing as 
soon as possible. 

I do not intend to create sour 
grapes fo r people enjoying their 
on-campus living experience. In 
fact, some of my fondest memories 
spring from the time I spent on 
campus. However, I would trade 
the rocky ups and downs of my 
freshman year housing term for the 
more level, more sane, more san-
guine days that I have had ever 
since I severed my ties with the 
Housing and Dining Administra-
tion .

Excess Booze Cau ... Much H •• tache 
Thought 
Bubble 

MARGARET O ' NEILL 

W e're in college. You may have already realized that. These four (or maybe 
more) years are some of the best 
of our lives, as responsibility has-
n't fully swept in and fun remains 
the ultimate goal. 

That's where alcohol comes in. 
As college students, we accept 

drinking as a vital part of our 
social lives, and even as a con-
stituent of our daily lives. For 
some. it was prominent before 
arrival at UCSD, and for others, it 
crept up and surreptitiously-
worked its way into weekly or 
daily routines. . 

Alcohol takes root in people's 
lives in many different forms. For 
some, it truly is social and it 
helps them feel more comfort-
able in situations and allows 
them to have more fun. But, [ 
ask, is this really what you want? 
What does it indicate when 
someone cannot be outgoing or 
meet people when acting com-
pletely for him- or herself? Peo-
ple should work through their 
inhibitions, rather than push 
them aside temporarily by being 
under the influence. 

I've seen what alcohol can do 
to all kinds of relationships. I've 
seen what it can do to lives. Peo-
ple in college take the term "alco-
holic· lightly; it should not be 
taken as such. Depending so 
completely on anything is detri-

mental to the human spirit. Alco-
holics really do lose their lives 
because of the substance. Alco-
holism apparently grows and 
breeds during the college years. [ 
don't know what [ can say to 
make those people who drink 
alone in their rooms for the sake 
of feeling the effects realize what 
they do to themselves and others, 
but [ know that [ wish there were 
some way to make them stop. 

This year, [ received some of 
the worst news of my life. [ was 
informed that the person [ love 
most in this world was hospital-
ized for drinking too much. She 
could have died, the doctors said. 
Her blood alcohol level was 
extremely high, especially con-
sidering how long ago she'd 
stopped drinking and how sick 
she'd been. [ didn't , and still 
don't, know what to say to her to 
make her realize the impact that 
had on my life. Less than two 
months later, [ had to watch her 
come near that level again. [ saw 
her too sick to control herself. 

This girl is 15 years old. She 
has a head start on many of the 
people I watch grapple with the 
same issue here at school. Maybe 
the difference for most is the free-
dom. Once we're out of the 
house. we don't have to deal with 
returning home drunk to face the 
wrath of Mom or Dad. But, most 
likely, the cause of the increase in 
dr!nkers is the atmosphere. 
Drinking is so highly valued at 
every college. (Well, maybe not at 
certain ones in Utah, but almost 
every one.) 

[ fell prey to that pressure. I 
don't regret it, but I do wonder 
how I allowed my values to change 
so drastically. I only hope that 

other people in the position [ was 
three weeks ago stand firm and 
don't give in to themselves. (Peer 
pressure is not what causes most 
people at this point to start drink-
ing. By the time you're in college, 
you've refused so many times. that 
to give in now you must actually 
make a choice for yourself.) 

Why do people indulge in this 
drug when it has such awful 
effects at times? [ don't think I'll 
ever understand the appeal of 
drinking so much that you can't 
make it to the bathroom to get 
sick and mess the rug in your suite 
or the stairs in your apartment. I 
don't understand how people 
rationalize the use of drinking as 
an escape from their lives, when so 
many drinkers get depressed while 
under the influence. [t feels worse 
to cry when you're drunk because 
you lack any sort of control. 

Control may be the issue. The 
only time people can control 
how out of control they are is 
while drinking. [ still don't 
understand the appeal of being 
out of control, even in the slight-
est. It's never a good idea to spray 
shaving cream on walls. Why 
would a person want to place 
himself at such a level where he 
would think it is a good idea? 

Alcohol is not an escape. [t 
does not help anyone act more 
suave or seem more appealing in 
the long run. It's addictive and it 
screws up entire lives. for the peo-
ple who overconsume it and all 
the people around them. ['m not 
saying don't do it; [ know how 
impossible that is. Just be aware of 
what it does and does not do. 

These are the alleged "best 
years of your life." You do want to 
remember them, don 't you? 

When deadlines are short, 
you'll long for our services.

major role in the new digital econ-
bmy. The South, in contrast to the 
North, has enjoyed great prosperi-
ty. Yet it has experienced its share 
of hardship as well. After the war, 
South Korea suffered two military 
coups, a series of popular rebel-
lions and years of chaos under 
authori tarian leaders. Since the 
fi nancial cris is that hit Asia in 
1997, South Korea has struck back 
as an economic fo rce to be reck-
oned with. 

Many Koreans have confl icting 
feelings about a quick reunification. 
I !!m one of them. The biggest con-
cern would have to be trust. The 
question lingers - "How ca"r two 
countries, at odds with each other 
for so long with two completely dif-
ferent ideologies, merge to make 
one?" What analysts have deemed 
the "Korean shuffle" becomes 
appropriate to this question. 

With every step forward the two 
Koreas ~ke, two steps back always 
seem to follow. For instance, both 

.Jides worked tirelessly at an agree-
ment on improving relations, only 
to have then-North Korean leader 
Kim die soon afterward. More 
recently, in response to the North's 
dire poverty, the South provided 
aid to famine victims. Its philan-
thropic mood was quickly spoiled, 
however, when it was discovered 
that a North Korean spy was 
watching the South from southern 
waters. 

The answer may lie in other 
precedents. such as the reunification 
of the two Gerrnanys late last centu-
ry. [f the present is any indication of 
the uphill struggle the process 
entails, you don't need to look any 
further than Germany and all the 
difficulties it has faced after the fa ll 
of the Berlin Wall. 

Easing tensions between the two 
Koreas will not be easy. Although 
reunification is an obvious step in 
the right direction, the process 
should take time. 

At one of the reunions, one 
woman's dilemma of reconciling her 
love for her long-estranged sister 
with her differing core beliefs served 
as an apt metaphor for the same 
challenge South and North Korea 
will no doubt face if reunification is 
ever to occur. 

During the meeting, emotions 
were high as the two embraced after 
decades of complete isolation. It 
only took a few hours, however, 
before both siblings were at odds 
with each another. The sister from 
the South could not believe how 
"brainwashed" her sister from the 
North had become, in her profes-
sion of litter devotion to commu-
nism and her abhorrence of democ-
racy. Indeed, it was hard for both of 
them to realize how different each 
had become and how hard it would 
be to come to terms with this. 

Critics claim that the North's 
increased openness to the world is 
motivated purely by economic rea-
sons. They point out how North 
Korea has concluded that American 
generosity is beginning to wear thin 
and that the most attractive alterna-
tive is South Korea. 

In other words, the North 
appears to have shifted its focus 
from the United States to its south-
ern neighbor fo r economic aid, 
hence the summits and talks of 
reunification. 

Undoubtedly, this is true because 
the North is suffering. Just the same, 
a deeper motivation still exists. Ulti-
mately, unification should be seen as 
a shared aspiration of all the Korean 
people. Years from now, a reunifica-
tion may bridge most of the heavy 
gaps that prevented all previous 
anempts before. Economics aside, 
the two need to reunify, but with one 
condition - gradually, without 
haste. Ten to 20 years down the line 
will prove to be the best time for 
Korea to recover the homogeneity of 
a people that has been lost in 50 
years of division.

your bike and weave through the 
pedestr ia ns (like ly off campus 
co mmuters doomed to walk fro m

five minutes after waking up. 

In reality, the only guarantee I 
can make about on-campus hous-
ing next year will be the difficulty 
in obtaining it. ot many plea-
sures can compare with being able 
to show up to class unkempt al)d

you complain of their need to 
drink coffee after having to get up 
early to make it to campus. And all 
pleasures come with some sort of 
cost, namely the Survivor-csquc 
alliances, positioning and sheer 
luck that will defin e the fight for 
on-campus housing. 

For the sake of self-in terest in 
the light of next year's housing 
crunch, this article is counter-pro-
ductive. Perhaps the best argu-
ment that I can make is to tell you 
to get off-campus next year and 
decide to do so quickly, before the 
housing lotteries start for next 
year. Really. Did I mention I saw 
an ad for a used, midnight-blue EI 
Camino at a great price?

........... D & NATION 
Suit Accuses Federal Contractors of 
Mishandling Cleanup at Nuclear Lab 

IDAHO FALLS, Idaho -
Buried in underground tanks and 
dumped into trenches at the 
Idaho Na tional Engineering and 
Environmental Laboratory 
nort hwest of here is a witches ' 
brew of deadly chemicals and 
radioactive waste left over from 
the Cold War. It includes enough 
plutonium debris from the Rocky 
Flats weapons plant in Colorado 
to build hundreds of nuclear 
bombs. 

The labora tory has built and 
tested civilian and military nuclear 
reactors for 52 years. Beca use of 
its residues and stored wastes, it 
was designated a Superfund site 
in 1989, and the government 
started trying to clean it up. 

Now two men who audited 
that effort say in a federal lawsuit 
th at governmen t co ntractors 
who were paid hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars made the conta-
mination worse. When the audi-
tors complained, they said, they 
were harassed until they 
resigned. 

The auditors said the contrac-
tors deliberately bypassed safety 
measures, turned off monitors 
and alarms, falsified documents, 
did not report spi lls. dumped haz-
ardous wastes on the ground and 
illegally sent waste from a pit con-
taminated with plutonium to a 
public landfill. 

Those contentions shed a dif-

ferent light on what state and fed-
eral officials told the public about 
the contractors' problems at the 
site. And in internal documents, 
federal officials shared some of 
the auditors ' concerns. 

Officials at the Idaho Division 
of Environmental Quality 
announced in May 1999 that the 
U.S. Energy Department, as the 

Now two men who 
. audited that effort say in 
a foderallawsuit that 
government con,tractors 
who were paid hundreds 
of millions of dollars 
made the contaminatWn 
worse. 

site owner, would pay $504,000 in 
fines and costs for mishandling 
dangerous waste. The division, 
and Energy Department officials, 
said at the time that the violations 
resulted fro m oversights or from 
problems created before the con-
tractors took over. 

But in 1998, an internal 
Energy Department review said 
the contractor that oversaw the 
lab and ran the cleanup at that 
time, Lockheed Martin Idaho 
Technologies, had not established 

"an underlying culture of rigor, 
discipline and sustaining leader-
ship" on environmental, safety 
and health issues. 

That review said that three 
major accidents, including the 
deaths of two workers, had 
occurred. It recommended that 
the contract be put out for bid. 

Jim Fetig, a spokesman for 
Lockheed Martin Corp., based in 
Bethesda, Md., said there might 
have been environmental mis-
steps in Idaho, but that none were 
intentional. 

"[ don't think for a second that 
there was an ethos of nonconcern 
about environmental issues," Fetig 
said. 

Besides Lockheed Martin, 
which ran the site from October 
1994 through September 1999, 
the lawsuit names EG&G Idaho 
[nc., the contractor that ran the 
site from 1976 to 1994, and the 
Westinghouse Idaho Nuclear Co., 
which ran the Idaho Chemical 
Processing plant from 1989 to 
1994. 

Mark ). Meagher, a Denver 
lawyer representing 
Westinghouse, said the company 
denied all the charges. Edward W. 
Pike, an Idaho Falls lawyer repre-
senting EG&G, declined to com-
ment.

Detroit Gives Answer to 
'Hybrid' Cars 

DETRO[T Japanese 
automakers have led the way in 
selling "hybrid" cars, which have 
improved fuel economy and 
reduced tailpipe emissions by run-
ning on either gasoline or electrici-
ty. 

But the Toyota Prius and Honda 
Insight, on the U.S. market for a 
year, are costly to produce and are 
sold in limited numbers at a loss, 
So Detroit is trying a middle 
ground. 

U.S. automakers will offer some 
"full hybrids," capable of running 
on battery power alone at low 
speeds, but they are putting their 
main focus on electrically assisted 
gasoline engines. 

Such engines. which cost little 
more than conventional engines 
but use a less ambitious technolo-
gy than some environmentalists 
want, will become an option . or 
standard equipment on dozens of 
models in coming years. 

General Motors and Ford exec-
utives say they expect to offer vari-
ous. levels of electrically assisted 
engines at least as an option on 
most models, though in some cases 
it may take a decade or more. Other 
automakers are more cautious, but 
with GM and Ford together 
accounting for half the U.S. mar-
ket, their rivals are likely to follow 
suit. 

GM is "committed to being an 
absolute leader in putting that kind 

of technology in our vehicles 
across the board - not each and 
every vehicle, because we still have 
customers that want to make 
choices, but having that option 
across the board," said .Harry 
Pearce, GM's vice chairman. 

Despite a preference for full 
hybrids, environmentalists are 
mainly pleased by automakers' lat-
est ideas. 

They are particularly surprised 
given that fe!ieral fuel-economy 
standards have been virtually 
unchanged since the late 1980s, 
and say the planned hybrids and 
voluntary pledges by GM and Ford 
to improve the gas mileage of sport 
utilities show that the industry is 
changing its ways. 

Auto executives say most of 
the vehicles are likely to be less 
fuel-efficient than the lightweight 
Insight coupe and Prius sedan, 
which $et 48 to 65 miles a gallon. 
That hIgh mileage, however, part- . 
Iy reflects their small, light bod-
ies. Compared with gasoline-only 
models, Ford estimates that 
Detroit's more modest new 
hybrids can improve fuel econo-
my by 10 percent to 20 percent, 
while the more ambitious 
designs, like those in the Insight 
and Prius, will gain up to 60 per-
cent.

"Face the ation" that there was 
"no truth" to Clinton's suggestion 
that three prominent Republican 
lawyers backed a pardon for Rich, a 
claim that all three immediately

Clinton also referred to three 
"distinguished Republican attor-

advocated" the case for the par-
dons. 

But the three Republicans 
Clinton mentioned denied any 
involvement in the pardon. 

"[ was as astonished as every-

article listed eight

AFGHAN[STAN - Field 
commanders of the Taliban move-
ment have been involved in the 
last year in the massacres of sever-
al hundred civilians in areas where 
fighting continues in northern 
Afghanistan, according to a report 
to be published Monday by 
Human Rights Watch. 

Victims have been mostly peo-
ple of the Hazara ethnic group, 
who are largely Shiite Muslims, 
the rights organization said. The 
Taliban, Islamic militants who 
control most of the country,. are 
Sunni Muslims and mostly ethnic 
Pathans. 

The Taliban accuse the 
Hazara of collaboration with 
Shiite [ran and the armies of the 
former mujahedeen alliance, 
once supported by the United 
States and now backed by 
Russia. Taliban forces have been

their smugglers, was sharp, too: not 
only for France, but for a Europe 
facing swelling tides of illegal 
immigrants from places as far-
flung as Iraq or China. 

On Sunday, the Kurds began 
describing their horrifying joumey 
from northern Iraq through Thrkey 
to the manicured shores of the 
French Mediterranean: packed for 
a week in the darkened hold of a 
foundering freighter with barely 
room to lie down, biscuits and 
water for nourishment, plastic bags 
for toilets, and kicked around by a 
crew in hooded masks who barked 
out monosyllabic commands in 
Thrkish, like "sit," or "inside." 

the mujahedeen alliance: out of 
Afghanistan. 

The massacres were reported 
to have taken place in two areas 
where fighting has been most 
severe in recent weeks - in the 
Yakaolang district around Naiak 
and around Bamian, a provincial 
capital that has changed hands 
twice in the last five days - lend-
ing urgency to calls by Human 
Rights Watch for action by the 
United Nations. The Taliban has 
denied earlier reports of large-
scale killing in the area. 

The rights organization said in 
its report, "Massacres of Hazaras 
in Afghanistan" (available on the 
Internet at www.hrw.orx), that the 
United Nations should order an 
immediate investigation of the 
reported massacre sites.

has also published reports critical 
of the armed opposition to the

reporters Sunday. "There was

the time. You couldn't see the 
oc;:ean." 

"Two or three times, we 
thought the ship was sinking; 
said Abdoul Salam, a 32-year-old 
man who said he had paid $5,000 
for his family to make the trip. 

On Saturday, tragedy was nar-
rowly averted - the 908 Kurds, 
including some 300 children and 
three babies born on board the 
boat, were helped off after a few of 
the migrants waded ashore and 
raised the alarm. The boat, empty, 
then sank as it was being towed to 
the nearby naval base of Toulon. 

Buses took the Kurds to a base 
of the 21 st Marine Regiment in this 
coastal town, where they were bed-
ded down in cots in a vacant mili-
tary warehouse. They underwent 
medical checks Sunday by a team

not to repeat the inconclusive 
work done by the U.N. high com-
missioner for human rights in 
1997, when as ma'1Y as 2,000 
Taliban fighters were killed by 
opposition troops in Mazar-i-
Sharif, prompting a tit-for-tat 
Taliban massacre on the same 
scale, mostly of Hazaras from that 
region, known as Hazarajat. 

[n its report Monday, Human 
Rights Watch said the most 
recent massacre took place in 
early January as the Taliban 
advanced toward Yakaolang.

"France is a country of democ-
racy, a country of human rights; 
one Kurdish man told a French 
radio reporter. _ 

But French officials, while 
deploring the tactics of the smug-
gling gangs and their exploitation 
of the poor, also made it clear that 
they did not want to be too wel-
coming, for fear of encouraging 
more migrations. . 

The police, who are hunting 
for the fugitive crew that ran the 
boat aground, were expected to 
serve notice on Monday that the 
castaways are either not officially

Regent: 
Applications for regent 
are due next week 
ContInued from page 1 
an undergraduate adviser at 
UCLA. She then began her grad-
uate studies and ran for the stu-
dent regent position . 

Davis is the first student regent 
to be elected to a two-year term. 
Previously, the term was only one 
year. The year as designate was 
added to allow student regents to 
become more involved and versed 
in the issues. 

"Even though you only have 
two years, you have things to 
learn, networking," Davis said. 
"Those don't take hours, they take 
months." 

The students present at the 
luncheon asked questions regard-
ing the position and the applica-
tion process. Davis informed them 
of different steps of the process. 

The first interview for the posi-
tion is with the UC Student 
Association. Her advice for this 
step of the process is to go to the 
UCSA Web site and find out where 
the association stands on issues. 

"A lot of it is figuring out what 
you can accomplish and what you 
can't accomplish and talking to a 
lot of people to find out what they 
think a student regent should be

doing." Davis said. 
Davis will not be able to vote 

until her second year. 
"[Next yearl I do all the same 

things as a regular regent does," 
she said . The year as student 
regent-designate is a nonvoting 
year. 

The last interview for the posi-
tion is with the regents them-
selves. Only three candidates in 
the UC system make it to this 
step. Davis again told applicants 
to prepare by knowing their audi-
ence. She talked about how she 
prepared by talking things out and 
realizing where she stood on 
issues. 

"The regents want someone 
they can spend hours and hours 
on buses and planes and in meet-
ings with, as well as someone they 
can work with," she said. 

Davis said she found the sec-
ond interview intimidating 
because it was with 24 interview-
ers and just her as the interviewee. 

"[The luncheonl broadened 
my mind as to the specifics of the 
job and what role I could have in 
it and the advantage~ I would 
bring to the position; said stu-
dent regent applicant and Warren 
junior rady Mikhael. 

The position of student regent 
takes up a lot of time, Davis 
emphasized. She said she is used 
to working 12 to 14 hours in 'a day 
and up to 30 hours a week in 

The UCSD Guardian 

addi tion to her graduate work. 
''I'm in my office doing 'regen-

tal' things between 10 and 20 
hours a week," she said. She has 
an ass istant who works 10 hours a 
week, but she does more t\:search, 
according to Davis. 

Davis summed up her job by 
simply saying "It is to direct peo-
ple to correct information." 

Revelle junior Seth Silvernail 
attended the luncheon to obtain 
more information about the posi-
tion . "I'm looking at all the impli-
cations of it." he said. 

During the luncheon, Silver-
nail asked Davis about the per-
sonal impact of her job. 

"[ think you need to.love what 
you're doing," she said. "You need 
to be willing and prepared that 
your friends and the things you're 
doing will be a part of this." 

The duties of a student regent 
include keeping well-informed of 
issues affecting education in 
California, being prepared to rep-
resent all students in the system 
and understanding how the sys-
tem actually operates. 

Applications for the position of 
student regent can be obtained at 
the A.S. offices on the third floor 
of the Price Center. 

Davis urged students to apply 
for the position. "It's learning an 
amazing internship," she said. 
"You learn so much about the way 
things really work." 

Graduation: 
Parking is still a concern 
as the event approaches 
Continued from page 1 

The staff at RIMAC has also 
been working for some time to pre-
pare the facilities to receive the 
thousands of guests that are expect-
ed to arrive on campus during the 
various graduation exercises. 

"We have to turn RIMAC field 
into a commencement site and 
turn Marshall field into a twice-
used area." said Steve Evans, pro-
duction manager for RIMAC. 

Though it is unknown exactly 
how many will be attending, staff 
will set up 8,000 chairs at RlMAC 
and slightly less than that for 
Marshall college's graduation. The 
other colleges are expected to draw 
6,000 to 7,000 people each. [n com-
parison to previous years, this num-
ber is much lower than the 25,000 
chairs set up for Clinton's visit, 
though it still presents a formidable 
challenge. 

"Previous commencements went 
perfectly," Evans said. "We received 
an amazing amount of support." 

The RlMAC staff is currently 
working to finalize the event budget 
and ordering the logistical elements, 
such as staging and sound equip-
ment, and hopes to have these items 
furnished by the end of March. 

NEWS 9 

In addition to meeting with the 
various campus organizers. Evans 
will also form a logistics committee 
responsible for the specitics of the 
program. It will be this committee 
that sets the final schedule for the 
ceremony and makes decisions 
regarding items such as band 
involvement and the chronology of 
events. 

"We're really, really excited 
about this new direction ," Evans 
said in reference to the decision to 
do everything on one day and fea -
ture a less political and more edu-
cational keynote speaker .. 

The organizers have worked hard 
to address the conce~ of parking, 
as the campus has to handle an esti-
mated 35,000 visitors between the 
five undergraduate and two graduate 
commencements that weekend . 
Shuttles will take guests from the 
east campus parking lots to the San 
Diego Supercomputer Center area , 
though not to the Marshall lot. 
Families of Muir and Warren gradu-
ates are urged to park in the east 
campus lots, Marshall and Revelle 
families will be directed to the Muir 
and north campus lots. and 
Roosevelt families to the north cam-
pus lots. Visitors are advised to arrive 
early, as gridlock is a definite possi-
bility. 

It is suggested that fa milies plan 
on arriving in the morning, as col-
lege commencements will follow 
the all-campus ceremony.

" The DUI 
- ---------- -

PriceTag 
w e all know that driving under the influence, or DUI, is a dangerous proposition . 

-According to the U,S. 
Department of 11-ansportation, on aver-
age, one person is injured every two 
minutes in alcohol-related accidents in 
the United States. In 1998, the total 
number of traffic deaths in California 
was 3,494. A total of 1,324 of those were 
alcohol-related, That is 37.9 percent, up 
from 35,6 percent the year before. But 
what is the actual cost of a DUI for a 
student in California? 
..... *-, 

According to Sara, a UCSD senior, it 
would be easy for any of us to get into 
trouble. The night she went out, she 
only had a few drinks and lived right 
down the street from the bar where she 
and her friends were hanging out. ~ : .e 
had planned on having a few ~ . IOks, 

, waiting a while, and then dri. illg home. 
"I've driven drunk before; I admit 

that: Sara said, "But, I totally thought I 
was fine that night. I'd driven because I 
had to work the next day. I figured I 
would be tille, and I would've been if 

my headlight hadn't been out that 
night: 

When the officer pulled her over, 
she hadn 't been weaving or speeding. 
He pulled her over for a broken head-
light. By law, the officer must have 
cause to pull you over, otherwise a DUI 
arrest can be thrown out. Sara passed 
the standard roadside alcohol tests that 
he administered, but the officer decid-
ed to administer a breathalyzer test 
anyway. Sara's test exceeded the 0.08 
limit and the officer -,rrested her. 
Usually, the 'arresting officer will 
impound the car of an individu;tl he is 
arre$ting. However, in this instance, 
Sara got lucky. 

"He aaed like he was doing me this 
huge favor by not impounding my car: 
Sara said. "I would have rather he taken 
my car and let me walk home: 

Sara was arrested and taken to the 
Las Colinas Women's Detention 
Center. 

"At the Las Colinas Women's 
Detention Center, they make you feel 
like the biggest loser ever," Sara said. "I 
seriously had self-esteem issues after 
that. Tl,tey take all of your stuff and 

\ I 
... 

make you feel like shit. They put you in 
a cell with everyone else that they 
picked up that night." 

According to Sara, the guards 
claimed that it was standard procedure 
to keep everyone who has been arrested 
in confinement for a minimum of six 
hours to give them an opportunity to 
sober up. The next morning, her room-
mate had to pick her up. 
MIke'.* • .." 

Unlike Sara, Mike, an incoming 
UCSD transfer student, felt fully intox-
icated the night of his arrest. He was in 
a small town in Nevada and his ride had 
left him at a party. 

"My accident happened three days 
before Christmas in 1999," Mike said, "I 
went to a Christmas party with my 
brother and his girlfriend: 

He admits that he was pretty drunk 
that ~ight. 

"It was bad news," he said. "I was 
really hammered. I was a block from the 
party and ~ took a comer way too fast. I 
don't know exactly what happened, but

official or reliable colleague to alter 
their daily slTategy or research 
methods. Many Cancerians will 
now encounter new work priorities 
or a last-minute shift of assign-
ments: Watch for group politics or 
an unusual power play between 
officials. Remain balanced, Cancer: Web Editor 

As with many of my fe llow 
Democratic supporters, I have had 
to come to terms with the outcome 
of ollr recent presidential election. 
Finding an uncomfortable reassur-
ance in the fabric of America n 
political principles, I am resolved to 
ride out the Bush presidency with-
out excessive binerness. This will 
not, however, prevent me from gen-
tly venting my concerns over the 
current state of the Bush adminis-
tration, and in particular, the com-
petency of our commander in chief. 

Last week, many Americans 
turned on the evening news, or 
perhaps even opened up a news-
paper, to discover the shocking 
announcement that the United 
States and Great Britain had con-
ducted an air strike against the 
lowly nation of Iraq. For those 
viewers who managed to remain 
attentive after hearing the words 
"dir strike" and "Iraq" in the same 
sentence, the startling headlines 
were fo llowed by a vague outline 
of events and last, but not least, a 
statement by Bush himself. 

The president , spea king on 
beha lf of his country and in the 
presence of fo reign officia ls, 
offered only four sentences on the 
developing situation in Iraq: 

"Since 1991, our country has 
been enforcing what's ca lled a no-
fly zone. A routine mission was 
conducted to enforce the no-fly 
zone. And it is a mission about 
which 1 was info rmed, and I 
authorized. But I repeat: It 's a rou-
tine mission, and we will continue 
to enfo rce the no- fly zone until 
the world is told otherwise." 

I certainly cannot speak for the 
majority of Americans, but a state-
ment about U.S. mi litary actions 
that uses "routine mission" twice 
in the course of four brief sen-
tences strikes me as either decep-
tive or uninfo rmed. 

Though our dear commander 
in chief has been known to blun-
der a syllable on occasion, I 
believe that his statement demon-
strates more a lack of information 
than a lack of oratory ski lls. 
Looking behind the game face 
that Bush has perfected for the 
public arena, the eyes of the man 
more often than not express a 
wondering panic - as if trying to 

fo rmulate the correct combina-
tion of buzzwords to quell the 
inquiries of the press. 

The president's brief, jumbled 
statements should not be seen as 
anything new. Throughout the 
campaign, even the mainstream 
media was attracted to Bush's brief 
moments of oratory ineptitude (A 
complete record is kept at 
http://slate. msn.com/Featureslbushisms 
/bush isms. asp) , but these are merely 
the curta ins that line the stage of 
what ought to concern us. What 
the public - and the media in par-
ticular - should have been con-
cerned with were the moments 
when it became painfully obvious 
that Bush lacked substance. 

During the debates, for

instance, the issue of affi rmative 
action was raised. Former Vice 
Pres ident AI Gore repea ted ly 
asked for former Gov. Bush's posi-
tion on the issue, refusing to 
accept Bush's initial endorsement 
of a vague "affirmative access" 
program. The vice president 
pressed Bush on the issue, asking 
if he agreed with a nonquota-
based affinnative action, as the 
Supreme Court had interpreted it. 

The si lence on the stage was 
deafeni ng as Bush looked a1 Gore 
without answering, and t~en to 
moderator Jim Lehrer. Lehrer 
never made Bush answer th e 
question. 

The demeanor Bush carried 
when pressed for an answer by 
Gore revealed something to every-
one payi ng attention at that 
moment. Bush's silence and blank 
expression were not, as some 
deliberate, a maner of political 
prudence or strategy; they were 
candid proof that Bush simply did 
not understand what he was being 
asked. Continually referring to 
quota-based affi rmati ve action, 
Bush clearly demonstrated \hat he

was not aware that the Supreme 
COlirt has invalidated such prac-
tices after the Bakke case in 1978 
- something that should be com-
mon knowledge for any presiden-
tial candidate. 

Following the debate, I eagerly 
waited for the media, our trum-
peted fourth branch of govern-
ment, to evaluate each candidate's 
performance. Surely, I thought, 
such an obvious nonresponse on 
a salient issue would gamer the 
criticism of news anchors and 
newspaper editors everywhere. Of 
course, it did not. 

Herein lies the reason that 
Bush was able to succeed in "win-
ning" the election. The media saw 
the serious, substantive flaws that 
Bush presented in becoming the 
Republican candidate; instead of 
critically evaluating his qualifica-
tions, the debate and his sub-
stance, they balked when faced 
with their duty to report the truth. 
Lehrer, in acting as moderator for 
t.he debates, neglected his duty to 
make Bush answer a hard ques-
tion, irrespective of whether it 
would have made Bush look bad. 

I believe that the media saw 
these unsettling occasions that 
demonstrated a shallow and whol-
ly unqualified knowledge of the 
issues, but nonetheless chose not 
to point them out. 

Was it becallse it would look 
like .the media were low-blowing a 
candidate? Did it think the public 
would cri ticize it for pointing out 
such personal flaws? I doubt it was 
that, either. 

In reality, I think that the media 
was hesitant to boldly challenge a 
major party candidate's qualifica-
tions. In doing so, perhaps it 
thought it would excessively criti-
cize the system as a whole. 

Whatever may be u'ue of the 
media's action, or lack thereof, the 
fact remains that Bush has been 
elected president and our concerns 
ought to focus on the present. As I 
gather from his fragmented expla-
nation of the recent intervention in 
Iraq, the president'S knowledge of 
such issues appears to be scant. 

Some have suggested that such 
vague comments are for the pur-
pose of being politica lly succinct, 
but I would lend more credence to 
the hypoth esis that Bush is

Alles (March 21-ApriI19) 
Romance is now prepared to 

move rapidly forward : Before mid-
week expect both lovers and long-
term friends to openly dedare their 
intentions. Passionate expression is 
positive, Aries: Over the next few 
weeks expect key relationships to 
deepen or become highly demand-
ing. Unattached Aries natives can 
expect several new attractions: 
Watch for a previously shy lover to 
soon present ultimatums. Late this 
week authority figures will chal-
lenge your ideas or dai ly habits: 
Don't overreact to small criticisms. 

T..,.. (April 20-May 20) 
Home relationships now begin 

a phase of cozy appreciation , 
Taurus. Over the next few days 
watch for close friends or relatives 
to release past stresses and finan-
cial worries. A relaxed social atmos-
phere will now arrive in family mat-
ters: Enjoy quiet, meaningful 
moments with loved ones. After 
Thursday expect to resolve a 
recently bothersome ownership 
disagreement. Areas of concern arc 
property maners, leases or short-
term wrinen agreements. Stay alert, 
Taurus. 

....... (May 21-June 21) 
Written documents and long-

term contracts are now a prime 
focus. Before mid-week watch for 
authority figures to recognize your 
fu ll potential : Use this time to 
solidify agreements and put group 
proposals into action . Some 
Geminis may also develop a sec-
ondary income source: Residual 
payments or new contracts are 
accented. Later this week romantic 
discussions will be delicate: Expect 
loved ones to be moody and unre-
sponsive. Remain patient, Gem: 
Much is changing.

Ego banles will fade by early next 
week. After mid-week also watch 
for a quick disagreement between 
friends. Complex romantic issues 
and willful personalities are 
involved: Don't confront. 

lAo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Early this week, key officials 

may question your time schedule 
or professional habits: Expect 
unusual communications or mes-
sages from authori"ty figures. 
Thoroughly explain your inten-
tions, Leo: Even though tensions 
may be high, this is the right time 
to publicly restate your needs, 
ideals and plans. After Thursday 
social relations and new friend-
ships will be particularly rewarding: 
Expect new acquaintances to be 
quickly drawn to your charm, wit 
and humor. 

¥!rio (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
Over the next few days expect 

loved ones to request more of your 
time and emotional dedication: Key 
issues involve minor jealousies 
over new friendships or long with-
held feelings of isolation . Old and 
new relationships may require del-
icate attention this week, Virgo: Let 
others know that you are socially 
or emotionally available. After 
Friday an absent relative or forgot-
ten friend may reappear. Remain 
alert to unusual business proposals 
or vague property agreements: 
Avoid financial risk, if at all possi-
ble. 

u .... (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
Long-awaited friendships or 

business contacts will be the theme 
over the next few days, Libra. Late 
Tuesday morning watch for both 
friends and key officials to propose 
new schedules or increased activi-
ties. Some Librans will leave 
behind past social regrets and out-
dated career ideals this week: 
Expect a compelling wave of confi-
dence and life direction to arrive 
soon. After Thursday watch for a 
sharp increase in romantic attrac-
tion and social flirtation. An excit-
ing few days, Libra: Enjoy!

screaming her head off, and I 
couldn 't breathe because I got the 
wind knocked out of me. The peo-
ple from the party must have 
heard the accident, because all of

the wmdow and starts yelling at 
me. I figure that I must have left to 
call the police, but when the 
police pulled up, it looked like I

his behavior, most attorneys do 
not recommend admitting to the 
police that you have been drink-
ing. 

Mike wasn't tested until two 
hours after the accident. 

"I blew a 0.16 two hours after 
the accident; he said. 

The accident resulted in his 
own injuries and damage to the 
car, which cost Mike additional 
money._ 

-He was not detained at a cor-
rection facility. 

- "Because my back was bother-
ing me, they just booked me at the

According to the Insurance 
Institute for highway safety, in 
1999, 28 percent of fatally injured 
drivers had blood alcohol con-
tents, or BACs, of at least 0.10 per-
cent. In 1999, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration estimated that 30 
percent' of all traffic deaths 
occurred in crashes in which at 
least one driver or nonoccupant 
had a BAC of 0.10 percent or 

more. The statistics went on to 
show that there was alcohol pre-
sent in 38 percent of all fatal 
crashes in 1999. 

Such statistics are sometimes 
cited as proof that between one-
third and one-half of all fatal 
crashes are caused by drunken 
driving and that none of the 
crashes that involve alcohol would 
occur if the alcohol were not pre-
sent. This is incorrect and mis-
leading because alcohol is only 
one of several faqors that con-
tribute to crashes involving dri-
vers who are drinking. 
Furthermore, some fatally injured 
people in alcohol-related crashes 

Drivers between the ages 
of 21 and 34 are also 
more likely than any 
other age group to have 
been intoxicated at the 
time of the crash. 
Additionally, they have 
the highest BACs in fatal 
crashes. 
are pedestrians with high BACs, 
and these fatalities would still 
occur even if every driver were 
sober. 

According to the National 
Commission against Drunk 
Driving, individuals between the 
ages of 21 and 34 comprise 
approximately half of all the 
drunken drivers involved in alco-
hol-related fa tal crashes and are 
responsible for more alcoho l-
related fatal crashes than any 
other age group. 

Drivers between the ages of 21 
and 34 are also more likely than 
any other age group to have been 
intoxicated at the time of the 
crash . Additionally, they have the 

The UCSD Guardian 

highest BACs in fatal crashes. 
Over the past 10 years, the. num-
ber of underage drunken drivers 
has decreased by 40 percent: 
However, in comparison, the 
number of 21 - to 34-year-old 
drunken drivers has only 
decreased by 13 percent. 
1IIe LMr 

In California, a driver is con-
sidered legally drunk when his 
BAC is a 0.08 or higher. BAC 
describes the concentration of 
alcohol in a person's blood 
expressed as weight per unit of 
volume. For example, at 0.10 per-
cent BAC, there is a concentration 
of 100 milligrams of alcohol per 
100 milliliters of blood. . 

For most legal purposes, how-
ever, a blood sample is not nec-
essary to determine a person's 
BAC. It can be measured much 
more simply by analyzing 
exhaled breath. In the event that 
you are pulled over and blow a 
0.08 or higher in a breathalyzer, 
you will most likely be arrested 
and taken to a police station, 
where a blood test will be admin-
istered. 

Be aware that submission to 
field sobriety testing and portable 
field breath testin~ is not required 
by law. However, under a proce-
dure called administrative license 
suspension, licenses a~e taken 
before conviction when a driver 
fails or refuses to take a chemical 
test. . 

Procedurally, you should be 
aware of the few rights that you 
are entitled to if you 've been 
arrested for a DUI. An officer 
must advise you of your constitu-
tional rights - the Miranda warn-
ing - before any further ques-
tioning takes place. You must be 
given a choice of breath or blood 
testing; if you refuse, you must be 
advised of the legal consequences

relatives and authority figures to 
be moody, self absorbed or overly 
critical. Some Scorpios will now 
witness the underlying jealousies 
of a manager or key official. Areas 
of concern may involve favored 
colleagues, career disappoint-
ments or highly demanding 
schedules. Avoid serious discus-
sions, if at all possible: Over the 
next 16 days private tensions will 
be deeply felt. An oddly emotional 
week, Scorp: Stay focused .

close friend or relative may be par-

Key issues are past romantic 
regrets or family disappointments: 
Expect loved ones to now be 
highly focused on past mistakes in 
important relationships. Be sup-
portive, Sage, but refuse to be 
emotionally drained. At present, 
your phitosophic outlook or com-
passion may derail your judg-
ment: Let others work through 
their own problems. 

Soapbox: 
Bush's advisors seem 1lJ be 
running the show 

increasingly becoming the mouth-

being carried out by his adminis-
tration would support this idea. All

Telling your parents can 
be the worst part 
Continued from ..... 13 
a 12-ounce glass of beer, a four-
ounce glass of wine and 1.25 
ounces of 80-proof liquor. Beer is 
the most common drink consumed 
by people stopped for alcohol-
impaired driving or involved in 
alcohol-related crashes. 

The effects of alcoholic drinks 
vary greatly because the rate that 
alcohol is absorbed into the blood 
differs from person to person. 
Other factors, such as the amount 
of food in the stomach, also affect 
alcohol absorption. Nevertheless, 
various organizations have devel-
oped charts intended to help peo-
ple estimate their BACs based on 
the number of drinks consumed. 
These tables can be used to 'esti-
mate BACs, but they are subject to 
error. Even after controlling for dif-
ferences such as age, sex and 
weight, all of which are known to 
affect BACs, an individual's peak 
BAC may differ markedly from the 
average indicated on the charts. 
Th. Costs 

The price of a DUI isn't just the 
arrest on your record or your par-
ents' collective wrath . There is a 
very steep monetary price tag as 
well. In California, a driver convict-
ed of a DUI will pay thousands of 
dollars in cOlin fees and fines. 

This can include $187 for vehi-
cle towing and storage, $156 for 
booking at your arrest, $100 for 
license reinstatement, an estimat-
ed $2,700 for car insurance 
increases, $480 for a OUI fine, 
$816 court assessment, $44 com-
munity service fee, $100 for a DUI 
victims fund , $50 for an alcohol 
education fund, $550 for DUI 
classes, $20 for a DUI victim's 

impact session and costs for a 
OMV file search. 

All totaled, this can cost over 
$5,200. This number can go up 
substantiJ lly if you decide to con-
tract an attorney, which both Mike 
and Sara recommend. An attorney 
can reduce your fines and reduce 
the amount of time that you lose 
your license. 

If the officer commited a proce-. 
dural error, the entire event can be 
thrown out if your attorney is par-
ticularly competent. 

According to Mike, because his 
arrest was the result of his accident, 
the total cost for the DUI will be at 
least $20,000. The repairs to the 
fence that he damaged were $150, 
plus a DUI fine to the court that 
totaled $660. 

The DMV charges separate 
fines from the court, which include 
$100 reinstatement fee for his dri-
ver's license and $300 for DUI 
classes. The most expensive part of 
receiving a DUI is usually the rise 
in insurance costs. For M ike, this 
means that premiums that were 
less than $100 a month will go up 
to over $300 a month for the next 
seven years. [n addition to his court 
fees and fines, he has had to repay 
the girl $1,500 for the damage 
done to her car. 

The punishment in drunk dri-
ving cases is set forth by statute 
and can be incredibly complex. 
The range of possible sentences is 
determined by the basic statute, 
with modifications for such 
things as having a prior convic-
tion within the past seven years, 
speeding 20 miles per hour over 
the limit, having a ch ild under 14 
in the car, having a blood-alcohol 
reading over 0.20, or refusing to 
submit to chemical testing. 
Additionally, if you get into an 
accident or do any property dam-
age, you will be held financially 
liable, which can significantly 

The UCSD Guardian 

increase the cost of a DU!. 
The actual sentence will also be 

affected by the facts of the case, any 
policies of the local court and pros-
ecutors, the weaknesses in the case 
uncovered by the defense attorney 
and the reputation of that attorney. 
DuII..,wltlln 

For some people, telling their 
parents is the worst part about get-
tinga DU!.

person, but, according to 
Mike and Sara, if you 
get caught, it's the worst 
thing in th~ world. 
a student, your parents are sup-
porting you. A OU[ is not just a 
social burden, it is a financial one 
as well. 

"My parents help me out with 
.school by paying my rent: said 
Mike. "They are really anti-drink-
ing. Now they think that [ am an 
alcoholic. [ screwed up and [ admit 
that. Drinking and driving is just 
about the stupidest thing you can 
do. They thought [ partied a lot 
before, but with this they thought 
that [ had reached rock bottom. [ 
still drink occasionally, but [ don't 
let. them know. It gets pretty dra-
matic with parents: 

The philosophy behind the 
complicated DUI punishment is 

that it will serve as a deterrent for 
those who have to go through the 
process. A part of this is an educa-
tional program, including meet-
ings where participants have to 
discuss what they did, why they 
did it, and whether or not they feel 
like they need help not doing it 
again. 

"Getting through this three-
month program will be the worst: 
Mike said. "It's such a pain. All the 
programs want to label you. They 
talk about helping you, but then 
they label you, and it doesn't do 
anything. You can't just be some 
kid who messed up. They have to 
analyze your family: 

The time that you have to com-
mit in dealing with court dates, 
meetings, lawyers and classes can 
be extremely time-consuming as 
well . 

"[Dealing with the DUll was 
pretty much all I did fall quarter: 
Sara said. "The DMV gave me a 
choice. I could either go without a 
license for four months, or I could 
~o one month and then have a 
restricted license for four 
months: 

The restricted license meant 
that she could drive to school and 
to work, but that was it. 

Additionally, the courts restrict-
ed her license for three months. 

"My arrest was Sept. 22, 2000: 
said Sara. " I'm estimating that I'll 
be driving again by the middle of 
June. That means I'll be driving by 
summer, which will be cool: 
DecIde for YouMIf 

Most of us have been there, or 
will be some day. Deciding to drive 
when you've been drinking doesn't 
make you a bad person, but, 
according to Mike and Sara, if you 
get caught, it's the worst thing in 
the world. 

"The people at the DMV are so 
rude to me now: Mike said. "[ 
called the other day to ask about 

Tuesday, February 20, 2001 

my license, and the lady was nice 
until she pulled up my record. 
Then she became extremely rude. 
When [ asked to speak to someone 
else, she agreed and then hung up 
on me. [ couldn't get anyone to 
help me: 

Socially, the stigma of having a 
DUI on your record is difficult. 

"The issue of the punishment 
isn't so bad: Sara said. "It's having 
it on my record. It's the stigma that 
is attached to drunk driving: 

Because a DU[ arrest and con-
viction goes on your perrnanant 
record, it can hinder you when you 
apply for jobs and to graduate 
schools. 

"When [ apply to graduate 
school, this is going to be there: 
Mike said. "If the school I apply to 
doesn't look, great. If they do, I'm 
screwed." 

Altogether, the cost of a DU[ 
really doesn't measure up to the 
annoyance of having a designated 
driver or getting a taxi. 
Additionally, if you were to acci-
dently inflict damage on someone 
else, the guilt and the stigma are 
extremely difficult to live with. 

"A taxi ride would have been 
five bucks. [What I did) was so not 
worth it," Sara said. 
*Names have been changed.

Baseball: 
Tritons lose three of four 
games to San Bernardino 
Continued from page 20 

Men's Basketball Woes Continue 
Bakersfield downs the Tritons 75-66, Stanislaus squeaks by 

"We nccd~d the timdy hits and 
didn't gct them," O'Brien said. "We 
had our chances to score but just 
didn't come through." 

Th~ SalUrday doubleheader in 
San Bernardino was iI vcri table 
ddmsll'c bloodbath, as the twO 
tcams combined for a whopping 
38 runs. The Coyotes piled on 13 
runs on 11 hits, including a home 
run by freshman Brian Schwdger 
to down the Tritons 13-2. 

In the second game the Tritons 
fared much belter, pounding out 
19 hits t Jvoid a sweep with a 16-
7 win . They really pourcd it on in 
the eighth inning, scoring half of 
their 16 runs. . 

With their first series complcte, 
th~ TritOns' CCAA record now 
stands at 1-3. They Will playa non-
league gam~ in Orange against 
Chapman University on Tuesday 
bdore looking to improve on that 
record this weekend when they face 
off against San Francisco State in a 
four-game set. The series will be 
played at Triton field here at UCSD, 
with the first gam~ happening 
Friday at 2:30 p.m., followed by a 
doubleheader SalUrday at noon and 
the snies finale Sunday at noon. 

O'Brien knows the Tritons will 
be in the thick of things once the 
season gets rolling. 

"It 's a very even league. Anyone 
can beat anyone on any given day," 
he said. "We're not taking any team 
lightly and nobody in the league 
should take us lightly." 

If the Tritons are to be success-
ful this season, O'Brien said, the 
whole team has to compete. 

"\W are going to need a team 
effort to get it done," he said. 
"Everyone has 10 contribute." 

By ARVIND VASAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's basketball team 
had a tough weekend, losing twO straight 
games to California State Universities 
from Stanislaus and Bakersfield. 

In the first half of the game against 
Stanislaus Friday, the Tritons played 
extremely well, shooting an amazing 60 
percent from the field . They connected 
all 7 of 13 three-point shoots, yet only 
made one free throw out of five . CSU 
Stanislaus, on the other hand, started of 
with mediocre play, shooting a low 28 
percent from the field. They connected 
on three three-pointers and added three 
free throws. Going into halftime, the 
Tritons were in command with a 38-26 
lead. 

In the second half, however, momen-
tum shifted to the visiting team. 
Stanislaus shot 58 percent from the field, 
connecting on seven three-pointers and 
nine of 14 free throws. The Tritons, how-
ever, were not as sharp as they were in 
the first half, shooting 58 percent from 
the field as well, but only attempting 19 
shots. UCSD shot an awesome five out 
of 11 from three-point land and an 
amazing 10 out of 12 from the free-
throw stripe. Yet in the end, the home 
team from San Diego came up a point 
short, 76-75. 

Guard ick Cristensen was the leading 
scorer for the Tritons with 22 points in 28 
minutes. Sam Higgins dished out 6 assists 
to lead the team. 

CSU Stanislaus got balanced scoring 
from Enver Soobzokov and Jeramiah 
Davis, who had 20 points and 18 points 
respectively. The team leader jn assists was 
Samer Sabbah with three, which illustrates 
the kind of one-an-one action their team 
used. 

"We were able to exploit some of their 

defenders," Christensen said. "We played 
within the offense and got a lot of easy 
layups. That seemed to be the key to 
building a good margin, breaking down 
their defense and getting easy lanes to 
the basket. It's tough to lose sllch a close 
game, but we played pretty well." 

Against Bakersfield Saturday, the UC 
team played another brilliant first half, 
but again could not sustain the momen-
tum in the second half. The Tritons shot 
50 percent from the field, and connected 
on five three-pointers to take a 35-31 
lead into halftime. CSU Bakersfield shot 
a meager 41 percent from the field, con-
necting on three of nine from downtown. 

In the second half, the Tritons got out-
played. They shot a decent 45 percent 
from the field, but connected on only 33 
percent on their three-point attempts. 
CSU Bakersfield, on the other hand, shot 
a sizzling 56 percent from the field and an 
awesome four for five from three-point 
land .. They played consistently down the 
stretch, making 14 of 18 free throws in the 
second half. 

"These last two games were really 
tough." Christensen said . "Stanislaus 
came out strong in the beginning of the 
second half when we worked to build a 
12 point lead at halftime. That lOok a lot 
out of us. We played better on Sunday, 
but couldn't pull out the win ." 

The Tritons' season record is now 3-
20,2-16 in league play. Both of the teams 
were in the CCAA division, which is 
turning out to be quite competitive. Next 
weekend, the UCSD men 's basketball 
team travels to take on two more CSU 
teams from Dominguez Hills and Los 
Angeles, respectively. So get on out there 
and and lend your support to our Triton 
squad as their season rolls on. These 
ucoming maches versus the two Cal 
State Schools will be a great time to get 
your cheer on.

Stanislaus, Bakersfield Ruin Weekend Softball: 
Harlan throws a no-no, 
Davis appears too much 
Continued from page 20 

Women's basketball team is hurting with Maya Fok is out indefintely with a stress fracture 
By ARViND VUAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team lost two tough games at 
home to CSU Stanislaus and 

~akersfield last weekend, bringing 
Its overall record to 13-10 and its 
league record to 9-9. 

In the first half against 
Stal1lslaus, the Tritons came Ollt 
firing. They took 27 shots but 
only connected on nine. The 
Tritons only made one three-
pointer in all the first half, but 
came up clutch at the free throw 
line, making 11 of 12. Grand 
Canyon was a mediocre 35 per-
cent shooting in the first half 
connecting on only 10 of28 shots: 
Genevieve Ruvald led the team 
with 11 points in the half, as she 
made seven of eight free throw 
attempts. The half ended with 
UCSD maintaining a four-point 
lead . . 

The second half saw the 
Triton·s struggling once again. The 
Tritons hoisted up 31 attempts 
~d made only 10. They connect-
II1g on ·one point attempt, and 
sank four out of six from the free 
throw line. Stanislaus was sizzling 
111 the second half, as it made 50 
percent of its shots and a scorch-
II1g 9 of 11 from the free throw 
line. It played within its offense 
and got consistent buckets in the 
paint. The final score read 65-55. 

Harlan shut out the Aggies in 
the top of the seventh inning, but 
Churchwell completed her shutollt 
of Triton baners in the boltom of 
the inning. 

In the second game, Maninclli 
went to work in the circle. UC 
Davis wasted no time ;.1 getting on 
the board. In the t p of the first 
With two outs, the Aggies were able 
to muster a run off a double that 
scored the runner at second. 

T~e Tritons scored their only 
run 111 the bottom f the third 
inning. 

. Anderson opened the inning 
With a walk, then advanced to third 
off a single by Wilson and a sacrifice 
bunt by Searing. UCSD's lone run 
came across the plate when Aggabao 
hit a sacrifice fly to center field to 
bring in Anderson from third base. 

Freshman Amy Metee had a 
strong performance at the plate, 
gOll1g two-far-two with two singles 
and a walk. 

UC Davis went on to score six 
more runs off Martinell i in the 
final three innings. The Aggies 
used two home runs; a two-run 
shot in the fifth inning and a three-
rlln long ball in the seventh, to 
close the door on the Tritons. 

",Stanislaus] shot really, really 
well from the field." said freshman 
Lauren Murray. "The team played 
really hard , but the rebounds 
killed us. They seemed to get all 
the boards. Overall, we didn't play 
our best basketball, but played-
hard."

QI_: UCSD s Kmzberly Hong leads a horde of players in a fight for the ball during a game on Saturday against Bakersfield. 

"UC Davis is a very strong 
team," Gerckens said. "Their 
offense was strong but it took them 
the second time around to see ollr 
pitchers. Offensively we couldn 't do 
what we normally can do. We didn't 
play poorly against Davis, our 
offense just didn 't come through. 
Next time we'll be better prepared." 

In the second game against 
Bakersfield, the Tritons seemed to 
have a win within reach agai nst a 
quality opponent. In the first half 
the Tritons shot 11 of 26 from th~ 
field, and an amazing 12 of 16

The Mixing of 
Reality With 
Sports Land 

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

S ornetlmcs, tragically. the :-<evcr Never Land that is the sports world inter-
twines horribly with the reality of 
el'eryday life. 

TIllS was again apparen t this 
weekend when two legends of th e 
sports world. Dale Earnhardt and 
Eddlc Matthews. left us forever. 

The shock of it all did not set in 
until I opened up the sportS section 
of 11 local newspaper. The stories of 
Earnhardt and Matthews were the 
only tll'O on the page - dominat-
ing. reminding. 

Earnhardt lost his life doing 
what he did best. fighting for the 
lead of a 0!ASCAR race. He died on 
the last turn of the last lap at the 
Daytona 500. 

Earnhardt was one of the 
greatest race car drivers ever. He 
was the Intimidator. He would 
JUS t as soon have run over some-
one for the checkered flag. A lot of 
peoph: may not have liked him. 
Many may have even despised 
him --:- his brashness. his bullying 
- but everyone respected him as 
one of the greats. 

Again, the argument regarding 
the dangers of racing automobiles 
at speeds over 150 miles an hour 
comes to the forefront . Should 
something be done to make it 
safer? Yes. But the risk involved is 
unfortunately the nature of the 
sport. 

Earnhardt will never be 
matched, let alone replaced. He will 
be missed, not only by his family 
and by NASCAR, but by the mil-
lions of fans who watched him 
every year race around turns, dom-
inating. 

Matthews' story is not as sensa-
tional, but not any less sobering. 
He died Sunday of complications 
from pneumonia. He was 69 years 
old . 

Matthews was one of the great-
es t baseball players ever. He 
launched 512 home runs. He dom-
inated third base. He died of pneu-
monia? Only 69? :'\0 matter how 
great you are, no matter how many 
home runs you hit or how many 
fans you still have, something as 
common as pneumol1la can take 
your life. 

I would like to believe that 
sports stars are Immortal, that 
they are perfect and that they are 
untouchable. But it is not the 
case. Car accidents happen, as 
happened to a pair of 'BA players 
las t yea r. Diseases strike stars, as 
MagiC Johnson , Sean Elliot and 
Lou Gerghig can attest. 
Alcoholism and depression and 
just plain old bad luck happen to 
these people. Their work'place is a 
lot different. Their fame is much 
grea ter and their pay sets th em up 
for life, but when it comes right 
down to life dnd death , there is no 
difference between them and us. 
They are just like us. They are 
mortals. 

Let's appreciate those seemingly 
immortal people we watch on the 
television and read in the papers 
about day in and day out. They 
won't be with us forever, and they 
may leave tomorrow.

PORTS 
San Bernardino Tops UCSD 
Triton baseball has a tough time against the Coyotes during 
their first California Collegiate Athletic Conference series 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The Tritons took to the fie ld 
late last week to open California 
Collegia te Athletic Association 
play with a four-game set against 
California State University San 
Bernardino. The first two games 
went down at Triton Ficld 
Thursday and Friday, while the 
Coyotcs hosted the series-ending 
doubleheader Saturday. 

In the Thursday afternoon tilt , 
the Tritons sent Alexander 
Crcmidan to the mound to make 
the historic inaugural CCM start. 

CSU San Bernardi no COllll-
tered with Brett Rudrude, who 
looked impressive, pitching the 
Coyotes to a 3-1 victory. He struck 
out seven while walking only one 
and allowing just two hits en route 
to the complete-game win. UCSD 
picked up its only run on an Eric 
Thorpe double in th e ninth . 
Cremidan was also solid on the 
hill , giving up a pithy four hits, 
while striking out seven and walk-
ing just one in nine innings of 
work. 

The Tritons helped the Coyotes 
by committing two crucial errors 
that resulted in a run in the fifth , 
and by giving up one more run on 
a Cremidan wild pitch in the sixth. 

The Tri tons sent ace John

score. Bestul and getting Chris Tallman loss.

UCSD Rocks Chico, Tables Turned Against Davis 
Leea Harlan no-hit C~ico on Friday, striking out 11 , leading the Tritons to a 5-0 victory 
By GLORIA CIRING 
Staff Writer 

Entering the weekend, the 
UCS D women's softball team 
hoped to improve on its 5-1 over-
all record, and its 3-1 record in the 
Ca lifo rnia Collegiate Ath letic 
Association. The Tritons split a 
doubleheader against Sonoma 
State University Feb. 10, and swept 
San Francisco State Feb. 11 . With 
just one loss in CCM play, the 

softball team entered a busy week-
end with two doubleheaders in 
two days against Chico State and 
UC Davis. 

The Tritons were successful 
Friday in a sweep over Chico State. 
In the first game junior pitcher 
Leea Harlan tossed her second 
career no-hitter, shutting out the 
Wildcats 5-0. 

In seven inn ings of work, 
Harlan walked three batters and 
struck out II, bringing her season 

record to 4-0. Harlan also provjd-
ed an offensive spark, knocking in 
the game's first run with a double 
in the third inning. The Tritons 
got all of their runs in that inning, 
as they went on to score four more 
runs. 

"She was on fire; said Triton 
head coach Patti Gerckens. · She 
pitched a dynamic game and kept 
the batters confused. Leea and 
[catcher Kristin HunstadJ worked 
so well together. T hey were fooling

the batters left and right: 
In the nightcap, junior Christi 

Martinelli threw a complete game 
and picked up her third win of the 
season. Kristina Anderson led the 
way offensively, hitting a double 
that scored two runs. 

Senior Michelle Wilson also 
provided a big lift for the Tritons by 
hitting a home run in the sixth. The 
solo shot was the first home run of 
her career. Martinelli slammed the 
door on the Wildcats 4-1. 

Saturday'S doubleheader 
against UC Davis proved to be a 
more difficult task. 

In the preseason, UC Davis 
was picked by league coaches to 
win the 2001 CCAA champi-
onship, but the Tritons were not 
in timidated. It was business as 
usual , as Harlan started the first 
game of the doubleheader. 
Although she couldn't repeat her 
performance fro m Friday, Harlan 
fared well , holding the Aggies to 
three runs. 

Unfortunately, Aggie pitcher 
Susan Churchwell did not give the 
Tritons anything, as the Tri ton 
offense was unable to put a run on 
the scoreboard. 

Trailing 3-0 in the sixth inning, 
the Tritons threatened, placing 
runners on first and second with 
no outs. However, UC Davis was 
able to contain the remaining 
UCSD batters. After Harlan struck 
out, Wilson was out at second 
when freshman Kim Aggabao 
grounded into a fielder's choice. 
The Aggies got Christina Searing 
to fly out to end the inning.
