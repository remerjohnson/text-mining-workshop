Many Unhappy 
and 

Happy Returns 
Greg Hicks 

With the debate and controversy of the ele tion 
having died down to a considerable extent, this might 
be an opportune moment to consider iust what 
proposa ls the California voters have adopted. A 
number of th propositions are of particuldr interest. 

Proposition 2, which was designed to improve health 
\c ience faciliti s at the University of Cali fornia, was 
favo red by a broad margin, 60.1 per cent for to 39.9 per 
(ent against. However, it needed 66% to pass . A far as 
L. .5.0. is concerned, additional medical sCience 
faci lities will not be constructed, University Hospital will 
not be improved, and clinical teaching facilities will not 
hE'improv d until more money is earmarked for health 
~ne nces . 

Proposition 11 likewi e was adopted hy il large 
majority: 62.9 p rcent to 37.1 per cent. Pas~<lg of this 
mf'asure means that the right of privacy will be in erted 
II1to Ihe State Constitution as one of the inali nable 
rights of people. Proponents of Proposilion 11 have 
clill med Ihat it will effectively restrici government and 

bu~in ess information gath ring acthit ip . It remains to 
be spen whether the measur will havE' IhE' d trlmenlal 
plfect on governmental welfare pro9,ram~ which op-
ponents predicted . 

Proposition 17, which was pa ed bv a 673 per cent to 
32 7 per cent margin, has reinstated t~ e d adl penalty in 
(alifornia , "subject to legi lative am ndmen! or repeal 
by sta tute, initiative, or r ferendum." The imposi tion of 
the death penalty in certain instancl's " giVing uncon-
tlolled discretion to judges or juries to decidE' whether 
H not to impose the death pen.llty," h stili un-

l (Insti tutional und r terms of the United State~ 
(on.,tlf ution. This measure overturn a pr VIOUS deci-
sion by Ihe California upreme Court, which declared 
th(' death penalty uncon titu tlonal. Apparentl y voters 
w( re more impressed With arguments thai the death 
Ill'na lty is in certain Instances appropriate and absolute-
Iv ne(1' Jry to prote'rt citi7ens, th.m with opposing 
cld lms that it i inhuman and has nbo d tf'rrent effect 
on potential murd rers . 

Proposition 18, th obscenity initia ivE', wa defeated 
soundly by a 68 per cent to 32 per cent margin . 
Proposition 18 would have imposed various censorship 
laws on "obscene" magazines, movies, etc. Despite 
Governor Reagan's support of th mea ure, it received 
li ttle support. Opposition to Proposition 18 included 
small televised anti-18 speeches by prominent figures in 
the movie industry (e.g. John Wayne), denunciation by 
priests (such as Father Charles Dollen at UCSD) and 
va rious editorials by radi.1 stations and newspaper 
urging " no" votes on Proposition 18. 

The marijuana initiative, Proposition 19, was defeated 
by close to a 33 per cent margin (66.4 per cent against, 
33.6 per cen t for) . Those who wanted Proposition 19 to 
pa swi ll kikely see the percentage breakdown as an 
expression of ignorance or unwillingness to accept 
many facts, compiled over a long period of time, which 
how that marijuana shQuld be decriminalized . It will 

not be possible, of course, to see what the eff cts of the 
passage of Proposition 19 would have been, but op-
ponents have maintained for a great while that it has 
many dangerous effects, and it shows lack of in-
lelligence to I galile a substance when its effects are 
not completely and finally known . 

Voters expressed concern for the state of the alifor-
nla coa tline in ar, approval by 55.3 per cent to 44.7 per 
cenl to 44.7 per cent of Proposition 20, the Coa tal Zon 

onservation Act. The act will hal t the dumping of 
was te materials into coastal waters, and restri t con-
\ truction, drudging, grading, etc. on coastline areas in 
Ca lifornia . 

Voters voi ed disapproval of busing for purpos s of 
achieving racial and ethnic balance in s hools. The vote 
wa 62.7 per cent for the anti-busing proposal, 37.3 per 
CE'nt against. With this m asur in effect, no public 

hool student will be r quired to attend a parti ular 
school "b cause of his ra e, cre d, or color" . everal 
sections of the Educational Code ar made void by th is 
proposition . Among these is the provision whi h states 
that persons or ag ncies responsible for matters relating 
to s hool attendance "shall prevent or eliminate racial 
and ethni imbalance in pupil enrollment." 

alifornia voters defeat d Propo ition 22 by a 
sileable margin : 57.9 per cent to 42.1 p r nt. A 
vigorous ca mpaign wa mount d against Proposi ti on 22 
by many individuals (in luding United Farmworkers 
h ad C sar havez) who f It that the mea ure would 
d prive the migrant farm work r of many important 
right. Many p opl f It that it would liminat th ir

AFT Speakers to 
Meet With 

Saltman 
Proposed changes in UC 

administration policies on 
promotion and reappoint-
ment of faculty will be 
analyzed by two represen-
tatives of the California AFT 
at a meeting this Friday, 

ov. 17, at 3 p.m . in the 
Revelle Formal Lounge . 
Patricia aint Laurence, 
professor of genetics at UC 
Berkeley, and Sam Bottone, 
executive secretary of the 
University Council, AFT, ac-
companied by represen -
tatives of the AFT loca l, will 
confer with Vice 
Chancellor altman concer-
ning the propo ed changes 
in e tion 52 of the Ad-
ministrative Manual, then 
address a public meeting 
on the implication of the 
administrative policy and 
the response of UC official 
to AFT objection . 

Th controv rsy began 
two years ago when Presi-
dent Hitch announced that 
certain changes would be 
made in ection 52 - Ap-
pointment and Promotion , 
Professorial eri s - of the 
Administrative Manual . 
Th s changes emphasized 
the probationary nature of 
assistant profes or ap-
pointments and 
downgraded the authority 
of the Budget Committe 
of the Faculty nat . Th 
AFT pointed out that th 
r visions of ection 52 con-
titut d the juridical ba is 

for establ i hing a revolving 
door policy at U wh reby 
a si tan t prof or could 

b dl missed Without 
rega rd to merit. This would 
mean a significant depar-
ture from a policy which 
has been one of the Univer-
ity of California ' greatest 
trengths - the ladder 
ystem in which every assi -

tant professor can be 
assured of the opportunity 
to advance to tenured rank 
on the basis of merit. 

Another draft of ection 
52 wa released thi 
September, but far from 
eliminating the changes 
which would lead to the 
re\olving door policty, it 
has made them more ex-
plicit. The new draft state, 
that a sistant professors 
could be fired or denied 
promotion because of 
budgetary con ideration or 
programmati ne d and 
that all fa ulty would be 
dependent on the 
availabilit of fund for 
promotions and merit in-
crease . 

ommitt e of the 
A ademic nate at U D 
are presentl reviewing the 
new draft, which is con-
idered 10 involv complex 

i ues of due pro e as w II 
a promotion policy. The 
p cific change in the new 

draft and th ir implication 
to the Univer it communi-
ty will be di cu d in d tail 
by aint Laurence and Bot-
ton at frida' m ting.

Neurobiology Lecture 
Dr. Roger Wolcott Sperry, Hixo n rrofessor of 

Psychobiology at the California Inst itute o f Technology, 
w ill deliver the fourth Al fred P. Sloan Foundat ion 
Lecture in eurobiology at the UC D School o f 
Medicine, Thursday, Nov. 16. Neurobiology is con-
cerned with how nervous system changes al the cellular 
and molecular level are related to hum,HI behavio ra l 
phenomeno n. 

Dr. Sperry will discuss " Cerebral Fu nction Following 
Surgical Separation of the Heml pheres in Man" at the 4 
p.m. lecture in the second floor auditorium (room 21 00) 
of the Bas ic Science Build ing on the Matthews campus 
of the University. 

A membel of the faculty at Calterh ~ nce 1954, Dr . 
Sperry first concentrated his investig .. llon~ on the 
growth of brain circuits. More recently tw research has 
dealt wi th the effects of separation of the cerebral 

hemi~pheres on the menta l life of man. His talk will 
describe results of his research . 

This year Dr. Sperry received the California Scientist 
of the Year Award in addition to the William Thompson 
Wakeman Research Award of the National Paraplegia 
Foundation and an honorary Doctor of Science degree 
from the University of Cambridge. 

The Society of Experimental Psycholo~lsts awarded 
him their Warren M edal in 1969 and the American 
Psychological Association presented him with the 
Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1971. 

Dr. Sperry received his Ph.D. from the University of 
Chicago. He was elected to the National Academy of 
Sciences in 1960 and to the American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences in 1963. 

A member of many professional societies, Dr. Sperry 
has served as Chairman of the Experimental P~ychology 
Study Section of the National SCience Foundation 

The Alfred P. 510an Foundation Lectu res arc made 
pOSSible by a Foundation grant to UCSD for develop-
ment of an interdepartmental program in 
neurobiologv. The lecture selle~ is one a,pect of the 
campus-wid program to expano les arch, training, 
and faculty interaction in vaflOU\ field~ rL·la ted to 
neurobiolog.,.. 

R ace and Cri. de 
Statisti s 

tatlstlcs compiled bv THE NEW YORK 11 11, ~ES Slrongly 
indicate that Ihe sentencing of i ndivirJual~ convicted of 
Crimes by f deral and state courts IS unjust. Among the 
TIMES findings were : 

l)Blacks on the average received longer sentences 
than whites; wh ites convicted of tax evasion for exam-
ple, got prison terms averaging 12.8 months compared 
to 28.6 months for blacks. 

2) Defendants represented by cou rt-appointed 
lawyers received sentences averaging more than twice 
as long as persons who could afford to hire their own 
lawyers. 

3) Persons found gu ilty after trial got stiffer sentences 
than those who plead guilty to the same crimes before 
trial. 

As an illustration of the kinds of se ntencing inequality 
that exists, thp TIMES related two sentences imposed in 
the same month in the same courthouse. O ne man 
robbed $15 from the post office and was sent to jail for 
six months . Another man SWindled $150,000 from a 
bank and was released on probation with no time 
served

OPINION 
Concerned 
Students ' 

(names withheld by request) 
The letter below reflects the opinion of the authors and 
does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the TRITON 
TIMES. 

Last Thursday Mar ine Corps recruiters were invit"d 
on campus by the Administration. At th is time, a faculty 
member, Pro fessor Reinhard Lettau, tapped one of the 
recruiters on the hat to attract his attent ion . As a result 
of Ihis act the Administration, represented by Muir 

ollege Dean Beckley, fi led a formal complaint ; Vice-
Chancellor Murphy suspended Profe sor Lettau ; 
Chancellor McElroy confirmed the sentence. The 
Marine recruiter did not press charges. It must b(' 
add<,d that none of these administrators wer(' pr('senl al 
the l ime of the incident. For some unknown reason, th(' 
Administration thoughl it usefu l to bypa ss the academiC 
C,('nale which as a mattN o f course examines all cas<'s of 
offen>e on cam pus. B<'low i~ a le\lN to th<' Administr,l-

I am outraged at the ease with which you have 
lJ;nored th(' con titutionally guaranteed right of 
due proces., and have suspl'nded Profe<;.,or 
Rl' inhard Lettau. 

Profe~sor L('lIau onl alleged Iv tapped one of 
till' Marine recruit('f~. But with thi~ charge, VOll 
11.1\1(' bludgeoned his, and our, basic freedom~. 
A("c ording to your own cldmin i st r ativ(' 
procedures, when a violation occur\ two verb,ll 
"Mning mu t be addr ssed to th(, offender to 
(l',H<' his activity or be served with a notice of 
,mp('nsion_ Not only wa~ thi" procedure not 
iollowed in Professor lettau's case but, without a 
trial, without a pu bl ic hearing before his peers, 
without allo wing him to face his accusers and 
respond to their accu satio n , you assumed the 
power of judge, jury and e " ecu tioner. By ad-
mini t rative fiat you entenced Professor Le ttau to 
a five day suspension and th en en forced th is 
illegal suspension by using the law (626.4 Calif. 
Penal Code( to give you the power to arrest him if 
he violated h is senten ce. 

By circumventing traditional institutions such as 
the Acad emic Senate, you aim to destroy the ve ry 
foundations o f freed om and knowledge on which 
academic life presumably rests. 

Therefore, I pro test the suspension order 
handed over to Professor Lettau and declare your 
behavior unacceptable. Further m o re, I insist: 

that Professor Lettau be reinstated w ith fu ll 
re torat ion of lost p aYi 
that a formal apo logy be mad e by you to 

Pro fessor Lettau, the stu d ents, and facu lty of th is 
imtilut ion i 

that the Acad em ic .Sen ate form ally invest igate 
Administra to rs M cElroy, M urphy, and Beckley for 
poss ible vio lat ions o f admin ist ra t i ve cod es. 

The th ree opinion art icles on th is pagl' were sub-
mi tted to the TRITON TIMES regarding the Lettau 
incident. 

.Professor Lettau was suspended for a tot;.1 of six days 
Without pay fo r his alleged striking of a M arine

Responds 

In addition to responding 
to the article printed on the 
opinion page of the Nov. 
10, 1972, TRITON TIMES 
regarding my involvement 
in the Professor Lettau inci-
dent, I wish to make several 
comments regarding the 
recent military recruiting 
on campus and the opposi -
tion to it. 

The first inaccuracy in 
this artic l e was Ih e 
ref rence attributed to me 
that , " ... two warnings

Administration's 
Handling 

of a Disruptive Incident 
Last Tuesday, tenured Professor 

Reinhard Lettau was suspended for 
14 days for allegedly striking a 
Marine Corps captain who was on 
campus recruiting for the Marine 
Corps officer training program. 

After Dr . Lettau met with 
Chancellor McElroy the suspension 
was reduced to 24 hours under the 
condition that Dr. Lettau answer for-
mal complaints before the Academic 
Senate. Chancellor McElroy stated 
that if Dr. Lettau acknowledged the 
substantial accuracy of the com-
plaints, a five-day interim suspen-
sion from campus would be levied 
immediately , during which Dr. Lettau 
would not be allowed to teach his 
classes on campus or receive salary 
for those f ive days. 

We were surprised at the speed 
and manner in which the suspension 
was meted out. After a thorough 
Investigation the TRITON TIMES 
sees a certain degree of absurd ity in 
the entire incident, and has some 
very grave reservations as to the 
future effects of such actions. 

Four ad min istrators submitted 
formal complaints to V ic e-
Chancellor Murphy. Two of those 
four did not witness the incident , yet 
they asked that the "appropriate 
action" be taken. 

The concept of a suspension was 
developed to prOVide an alternative 
to using University police to control 
demonstrations and actions whtch 
Violate University policy . Yet 
Professor Lettau was cited under 
California State Penal Code Section 
626.4, and not for violating any 
University regulation . 

According to MUir Dean Beckley, 
the procedure for halting disruptive 
activity ts: 1) to verbally Inform the 
indiVidual he IS committing a viola-
tion, and that a suspension notice 
Will be served; 2) when a violation 
occurs the offender Will be verbally 
r otlf led to cease the actiVity; 3) If the 
l o latlon continues. the indiVidual 
wll be served with the suspension 
r otlce ; 4) if the action is not halted at 
hiS t ime. the campus polrce Will be 

called in to restore order. 
This procedure was not used in 

the suspension of Professor Lettau. 
The TRITON TIMES is appalled by 

this inconsistency on the part of 
UCSD administrators. Furthermore, 
we see that in their desire to uphold 
the policy of open recruitment the 
UCSD administrators created a 
dangerous precedent out of a trivial 
incident. Due process was denied 
Dr. I_ettau, as he was deemed guilty 
and penalized unless he chose to 
prove otherwise. To add to the ab-
surdity of the situation , Dr. Lettau 
feels that the incident was so trivial 
he will not present his case to the 
Academic Senate, and have his time 
wasted by a month of committee 
meetings. 

The administrators have in-
advertently established a dangerous 
precedent for dealing with campus 
disturbances. Through their ex-
plOitation of this inCident they 
appear to be warning University 
community members that if we don't 
behave ourselves (in the eyes of the 
administrators and not necessarily in 
the eyes of University regulations 
and state laws) we will be subject to 
penalty and fine without a judicial 
hearing until after the penalty has 
been met. 

We hope that the UCSD ad-
ministrators will re-evaluate their 
policy and procedure for dealing 
With campus activities, and that they 
will make their policy clear to the 
University community. If not, they 
w ill only succeed in alienating the 
community and promoting a feeling 
of distrust of the UCSD administra-
tion. Already we have students reac-
ting In thiS manner, calling for the 
reSignation of Muir Dean Beckley. 

We are not questioning Dr. Let-
tau's guilt or Innocence, but we feel 
that the administration owes the 
community an apology for handling 
the inCident In such a poor manner, 
and a guarantee that In the future 
such absurd and unfair practices will 
not be allowed to happen again

Thursday, Nov. 2. That article alleges that 
I "a ttacked the plan 's goal of 'fostering 
the development of a ra ially, ethnica lly 
and economically balan I'd co m-
munity.'" By comparing th enclosed 
text of my remarks be for the City Coun-
cil in which I did oppose the plan be-
ca use it cou ld not deliver, a balanced 
community, it is possilbe to see the ex-
tent to which I was misq uoted and sub-
sequently how damaging that co mment 

{'an be. As a resu lt , I have written to Mr 
Gene Gregston, editor of the SA 
DIEGO UNION regarding a retraction. 

I would appreciate any help you and 
thc TRITON TIME cou ld give in clpar 
ing up any misconceptions which mighl 
arise within the University community ,1' 
a result of someone reading that arrici(' 
and not understanding how erroneou~ il 
is . 

Thank you .

Excerpt from THE SAN DIEGO UNION story 
published Friday , November 3, 1972 (emphasis ours). 

La Jolla Shores Plan Approved 
By City Council 

Mrs. Charles Cochrane, 
co-chairman of the shores 
association, sa id the plan 
ca lls for cont rolled growth. 
Exist ing zone r gulations 
are not adequate to con-
trol growth, she said. 

"We also hope to achieve 
beautification of the area 
and protect the health and 
safety of the residents," 
Mrs. Cochrane said. 

Attorney leon Campbell, 
representing Edmund Saw-
yer who owns 40 acres of 
land in the area, said th 
plans "keep intact the pres-
ent environments." 

"We're already in a 
straigh t jacket, you don't 
have to handcuff us," 
Campbell said in re~ard to 
possible further regula -
tions for development. 

November 3, 1q72 

" The whole plan was d -
vised to accommodate 
businessmen and tho e liv-
ing on high prop rty which 
possesse a good view," he 
said. 

Rev. Les Atkinson of 
UCSD attacked the plan's 
goal of "fostering the de-
velopment of a racially, 
ethnically and economic-
ally balanced community." 

According to Mrs. 
Cochrane the plan will pre-
serve the residential char-
acter of the communit y. 
There are 1,400 single fami-
ly homes, 700 apartments 
and 460 hotel-motel units in 
the area. More than 5,300 
persons reside in the area 
according to Mrs. 
Cochrane. 

E itor's note : The A 
DIEGO UNION printed a 
orrection in last Satur 
ay's edition. In the correc 
ion, the UNION never ad-

mitted that t hey had mls, 
uoted Mr. Atkinson, and 
voided the admission by 
tating that Mr. Atkinson 
isagreed with their repor-

ting on the council 
meetin . 

Mr. Gene Gregston, Editor 
San Diego Union 
940 Third 

Commille of the San Diego Count \' 
Ecumenical Conference have been dir-
ected toward balanced ommunities in 
all areas of San Di go County. 

an Diego, California 92102 
Dear Mr. Greg\ton: 

On ov. 2, I appeared befor the San 
. Diego City Council to oppose the adop-

tion of Ihe La Jolla Shore Precis Plan . 
According to your rrport of that hearing 
on page B-3 of you r edilion of Nov. 3, 
1972 I illiegedly "attacked the plan 's goal 
of 'fmtNing the development of a racial-
ly, ('thnically and economically balancpd 
communi ty.'" That statement as It stands 
makes me ou t to be opposcd to balanced 
communitres.

As you can se from the enclose text of 
my statem nt before the City Counril , 
my opposition to the La Jolla hore~ Pre-
cise Plan was precisely because it did not 
meet ils own stated goals, namely, thp 
fmtNing of a racially, ethnically and 
economica lly balanced comm unity. I 
supported this contention by pointing 
out the many elements of the plan whi rh 
can only be se n as the continuation 01 
thc existing one - dimensional uppl'r 
middle cla~s living pattern. I did not 
a tta ck the goal itself , but rath pr 
~ugge ted th,1\ It be honor d.

A an amateur teacher 
evalua tor of long $tanding I

annoying habit of dropping

coincidence that upon m y 
infiltration of the UCSD 
campus my target became 
the Humanities program. 
I'm sure Valerie will be verv 
glad to know that one 01 
her own classes was the 
subject of such an attack of 
spa re time. Unfortunat Iya 
resulting bout of boredom 
ha pi evented my r vi it i ng 
that ection , but in that visit 
I wa~ very impressed to find 
that the first p,lper of thes£' 
blooming Hum ani ti es 
students had been graded 
primarily on spelling, punc-
tuation , word usage, and 
grammar. From now on I 
am positiv that when these 
students Si t down to write a 
paper, Ihey will obs rve 
these thing so raref u II y 
that the AEC Will never 
know that th papers were

Track Benefit • • • 
24-Hour Runs 

This coming Friday at 4 p.m., ten people will meet in a 
corner of the athletic field in front of the gym. One of 
them will begin running around a precisely-measured 
v. mile course which will form a rough oval around the 
two intramural football fields. After completing four 
laps of the course (1 mile) the first runner will hand a 
small blue stick that he has been carrying to a second 
runner who will then carry the stick for four more laps. 
This process will continue until all ten members of 
UCSD's own "Over The Hill Gang" have completed one 
mile. 

Then what happens you ask? Do they catch their 
breath, wipe the sweat from their faces, and head for a 
beer at Don Campbell's apartment? 0, instead of 
calling it quits after they have each run one mile, the 
"Over The Hill Gang" actually plans to start in on a 
second mile, and then a third, and a fourth and a fifthl 
In fact: they plan to keep up this insane 10-man relay for 
24 solid hours, after which time they hope to have 
covered somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 miles! 

Just what is the reason behind all this insanity? Can't 
these tired old seniors (and one freshman) come up 
with a better way to spend their weekends after 4 years 
at UCSD? We", actually they can, but in this instance 
they don' t want to. For the last week or so the gang has 
been quietly soliciting people to sponsor them for 
however many miles they manage to run . Some of the 
la rger donors have been giving as much as a pE'nny per 
mile(!), but donations as sma" as one-fiftieth of a cent 
per mile have been gratefully accepted . According to 
Kirk (mellow legs) Newell, spokesman (one of ten ) for 
the gang, the money raised from this undertaking will 
be donated to Coach Andy kief's UCSD track team, so 
that the team will be able to travel to some of the bigger 
Invitational track m ets this coming spring. Without the 
money, the team will be forced to remain at home and 
run their meets on UCSD's famous (for heing so slow) 
track (I didn't even know we had o ne!). Besides making 
the monev for the track team, the following are some of 
the "~trong" motivational reasons that these tE'n idiots 
hav!' dE'[lded to try for 24 hour~ of continuous running : 

Ed Ava!' ~chool three-mile record holder, "Thl' way I 
figgC'r It, you only go around once In life, so you\e got 
o grab for all the gu,to you can ge'!" 

Don C.lmpbe"· steeple cha~er extraordlnairp, "We 
hould he ju~t about out of dope th.lI wepkend " 

Paul Mitch; converted ~onf'r pla~er' "I wanl to Irv 
and gl't rid of my bE'E'r be"y." 

Carlos Robles: convertE'd SOC[f'r player; "Lo hilgO 
para ,. La Raza". 

Chuck (Cap'n Crunch) Crumbly: UCSD's most im-
proved runnf>f; "I think it will be a pretty good 
workout." 

Kirk (Mellow Legs) Newell; you name it, he runs it; 
"I'ei rather run than ~tudy. 

Fred Sorenson; One of UC D 's fastest sprinters ; " I 
want to prove to my wife that I've still got a lot of 
E'ndurancp." 

Mike BE'rchamp; Freshman record-holder on UCSD's 
tough cross-country cou rse; "I figger that if I average 
4:20 p r mHe, we shou ld be able to break the world's 
reco rd." 

Dave Robinson; Consistant III and 1,. miler; "They 
threatened to burn my apartment down if I didn 't help 
out!" 

Anyway, whatever their reasons, TRITON TIMES 
.... shes them the best of luck and suggests that Saturday 
a. ternoon when Its all over that they do wipe the sweat 
o f their faces, catch their breath, and head over to Don 
Campb II's for a beer or whatever.

The UCSD hoopsters put 
what can at best be 
r ibed as a ragged dis-

y of basketball last Friday 
in a scrimmage against 
Mesa Junior College. 
Despite moments of in-
dividual brilliance, the ef-
fort of the team as a whole 
was sorely lacking. The fast 
break sputter d, the 
rehounding was poor, the 
passing was atrocious, and 
the shooting was only fair. 
Paul Trainer and Dave 
Moragne were the only real 
bright spot~ for the Tritons 
as they scored 20 and 18 
points re pectively . 
Opening-game jitters and 
inexperience seemed to be 
the major causes of the 
poor play, but experienced 
observers are still predic-
ting great things to come. 
With the help of a tena-
cious full-court press, 
spearheaded by Bruce 
"Boom Boom" Breath-
waite, John May, and Jon 
'Frenchy" LeLevier, the 

Tritons came back from a 
six-point deficit, with five 
minutes to go, to win 75-68. 

Since most of the team 
members haven't played 
together before, the 
offense hasn't had time to 
gel yet. But the Tritons have 
a wealth of individUul talent 
this year and should 
become a fine club. Retur-
ning at center is 6'7" Paul 
Trainer. Although he spent 
most of the summer 
looking for new species of 
fish, and didn't even touch 
a basketball, Paul has 
looked exceedingly good in 
practice. As a freshman last 
year he led the Tritons with 
a 22.0 scoring average and 
also led in rebounding. His 
soft hook shot and ex-' 
cellent inside fakes garner 

Introducing the tball Team 

him most of his points. Also 
looking tough at center is 
Herb Hunter. Herb shoots 
we" from the outside and is 
probably the best shot 
blocker on the team. The 
locker room B.S. that he 
and Boom Boom throw 
around helps to keep the 
team loose after a tough 
practice. 

The Tritons have a 
number of good guards and 
forwards, all of whom are 
fight ing for starting berths. 
Among the forwards Pete 
Henderson, a returning 

starter, is beginning to im-
press on the boards again 
after suffering an early-
season ankle injury. Pete is 
a fine passer and plays 
aggressive defense . Gie 
Simpson, a transfer from 
USD, has amazing agility 
and leaping ability and, 
when he puts it all together, 
can be truly awesome. His 
play will undoubtedly be a 
big factor in the SUl.cess of 
this year's team. Steve 
Higgins, a transfer from UC 
Irvine, is probably the best 
outside shootin 

and has displayed Photo s: Eastern

tion. Bruce rebounds ex-
tremely well for a man only 
6'1" and is the most 
enthusiastic, hustling player 
on the squad . He's an ex-
citing, tenacious defender, 
and is an important compo-
nent of the full-court press. 

The Tritons are also very 
deep at guard wher the 
most welcome addition is 

Bob Spriggs. Anyone who 
watches basketball at UCSD 
has marveled at Mr . 
Smooth doing his thing. His 
speed and soft jump shot 
make him a valuable asset, 
and Coach Reelles un-
doubtedly ce lebrated the 
day Bob decided to play for 
this year 's team. Two solid 
returnees from last year's 
club are Jon LeLevier and 
John May. LeLevier, a two-
year starter, has sparked 
numerous Triton rallies 
with is pesky hands-in-
their-fa ces defense. He 
always seems to come up 
with a loose ball, and when 
he manages to stay on his 
feet his hustle and 
aggressiveness are a 
tremendous asset. It 
remains to be seen whether 
his newly found shooting 
touch is for rea I or not. 
John May plays excellent 
defense and has emerged 
with a great corner shot this 
year which, combined with 
his driving ability, make 
him a potent offensive 
threat. Dave Moragne at 
5'11" and 195 Ibs. has a set 
of muscles that elicit 
coun tless oohs and ahhs 
from the stands. When he 
decides to go to the basket, 
there ain ' t nobody that's 
going to stop him. He is also 
a fine shooter and has very 
quick hands. 

The Tritons host a team 
from Camp Pendleton in a 
scrimmage tomorrow at 4 in 
the gym . They will un-
doubtedly improve on 
Friday 's performance 50 
come on out and enjoy 
some basketball . 

Roxy's Crabs Crowned 
Queen of In tramurals 

It all started way back in 
the beginning of Octobpr, 
and now, for all pra ctical 
purposes, it is over ... the 
biggest coe d football 
season in UCSD history has 

ome to an end. 

Except for one or two 
make-up games and the 
championship playoffs, the 
season ended, most ap-
propriately, with the final 
whistle ending the Roxy's 
Crabs vs. Yuba City Goasers 
get-together. For thos of 
you who didn 't play coed 
football this yea r or who 
played and didn't have as 
much fun as you expected, 
this game could have been 
a valuable lesson for the 
future . The Goosers, who 
just a few days earlier had 
lost their chance at t he 
championship , played the 
true champs of coed foot -
ball to a 3-3 tie. Now, you 
may wonder how a score of 
3-3 was attained . We" , with 
teams like the Crabs and 
the Goosers is it really quite 
simple. All you have to do is 
play around for an hour, 
watch the Crab's Marching 
Kazoo Band put on a half-
time show, razz the refs a 
bit, substitute a basketball 
for the football for about 
eight plays, and end the 
game with fourteen girls 
scoring a safety on fourteen 
guys, and then decid that a 
3-3 score is pretty Indicative 
of the tone of the game. 
That after all is the spirit in 
which coed sports shou ld 
be plaYl'd . Therl' is plenty 
of room for rea l football 
action, but there I~ no 
rea son that competition ha~ 
to takt the fun out of It .. -
just J~k the Crab~! 

Onl' of the tru(' 

Some of the other rpally 
fine teams thi ~ ypar In-
cludpd the Miraclp 
Workers, and thE' o ther 
Crabs, led by their three 
foot tall captain. Thesp two 
tl'ams proved to be ex-
cellent blends of clowns 
and athletes. One of thp 
most surp rising teams wa~ 
the Good, the Bad, and thl' 
Earlin ... surpming in that 
they too werC' content to 
clown around on the field , 
when they probably [ould 
have been plaYing pretty 
tough football. They ex-
ploded the myth that thE' 
whole De Anza gang was 
he "-bent on winning E'Vf'fy 
game they played . It is 
learns likp these that make 
coed football ex-
ci ting ... teams that have a 
fair amount of talent, a lot 
of imagi nation, and oc-
casionally a flair of show-
manship, in dreaming up

In a game which definitely substantiated what wp 

already knew about the Women's VoIIE'yball TE'am, th 
UCSD girls downed the girls at State 15-7, 15-7. The 
Triton girls started apprphensiveh , miSSing two valuablr 
hitters in the first game: helley Hill and Brandy Klein 
Poor serving got the girls off to a slow slart and thE'~ 
were behind 4-5 before they hit the shots and ~dlned

there on as the Tritom wpnt on to dominate 15-7

tiarold Land Lyrics 
The internationally famous jazz tenor saxophonist 

Harold Land and his quintet will give a concert on Fri -
day, Nov. 17, at 8:30 p.m. in Revelle Cafeteria on the 
UCSD ca mpus. 

Harold Land, who plays flute and oboe as well as 
tenor saxophone, was born in Houston, Texas, in 1928, 
but his family moved to San Diego when-he was a child 
and he was raised here. His inte rest in music found its 
first expression in high school. In 1946 Land started 
playing professionally around San Diego. At this time 
Land was influenced first by fellow tenor sax player 
Lucky Thompson, and by Charlie Parker. I Like many other serious jazz musicians (such as 

I 
Clifford Brown and John Coltrane). land served an ex-
tensive apprenticeship in various rhythm and blues 
groups. In 1954 he moved to Los Angeles where he 
found ardent admirers in Clifford Brown and Max 
Roach, who asked him to join their recently formed 
group. The Clifford Brown-Max Roach quintet with 
Harold Land became one of the seminal jazz groups of 
the 1950's, setting th stage for the "hard bop" idiom 
which has dominated a large se tor of the jazz world 
ever since. land's name became known throughout the 
world , and he has been an influential and admired 
tenor saxophonist for over two decades now. 

A contemporary of John Coltrane, and influenced by 
th same sources, land, like Coltrane, developed a 
trong, many-faceted tonality, combined with a long-

lined style of improvisation in which flurries of notes al-
ternate with voice-like cries and lyric flights . 

Tickets are 75 cents in advance to UCSD students and 
$1 for UCSD students at the door. General admission is

Each year, the International Soci ty for Con -
temporary Music holds a festival a week and a half in 
duration . The mechanics of th se gatherings are enor-
mously complex since they must allow for a reasonJbl y 
balanced_."ational and styl istic representdtion . Every-
thing mitigates against success: the diversity of langu-
ages, musi al styles, and political persuasions; and, p('r-
haps most serious ly, th difficulty in finding large num-

willing to play conceptually demanding music. 

Thi~ y('ar, th Austrian e tion of th IS M hosl r o thp 
Festival In Graz, some hundred mil s south of Vienoa 
near the Yugoslavian border. Though I am not a m('m-
ber of the ISCM, the international program ommlftee 
elected an intermedia work of mine, "Ping" (1968), for 

performance and I traveled to Austria for a festival that 
looked very promising on paper. Other A'11ericans re-
pres nted were John Cage and Morton Feldman, 
though neither was present. Works of almost all the 
prominent name s in new music wer e 
schedu led - Boulez, Stockhausen , lutoslawski , 
Dallapiccola, Berio, Globokar, Kagel-and most of 
them were there for the occasion. 

One was struck immediately by the general, and per-
haps unavoidable, confusion in Graz. Everyone was dis-
satisfied with preparations. The Festival programming 
was altacked at ISCM Council meetings, necessary 
equipment found lacking, rehearsal time inadequate, 
performe rs rebellious, and everyone suffering the dull-
ing impact of jet-lag. Some invited performing groups 
(The notion of bringing well-rehearsed ensembles in-
tact to the Festiva l was an important forward st ep in 
policy) ca ncelled because the Austrian hosts could not 
guarantee sufficient rehearsal time or supply vital per-
cussion instruments. The scheduled performance of my 
piece was upset by the cancellation of the theater group 
from Wiesbaden . and I arrived knowing that I would 
have to piece together an optimum presentation based 
on what was available. 

Having sent ahead a complete list of necessary equip-
ment in ample time, it seemed reasonable to expect 

that th(' problems would in vo lvp no morp Ih,m (h()()~-

Audl('nce reaction of my work, th t' only o ne In thp 
entire festival concerned with multiple mediums (f ilm, 
slides, live, and lectronic mUSIC), reinforced th(' con-
fusion I had sensed in the reactiom of o rganilers and 
technician s. Many remarked on the "seriousness" o f 
Ihe work, as though, for some reason, thiS chararter-
istic was not a part of their experience With o ther con-
temporary European music. 

It was an extraordinary and sobering pxperlenrp to 
visit Austria and Vienna, the former seal of so much that 
is basic to Western music tradition, and find such a 
wid spread disengagement from trends in art and 
cultural standards we take so much for granted here 

Sticky Saran Wrap - Hallelujah! 
Brandon Wanf'Jer 

Ever since my last pilgrimage to Disneyland I've had 
thiS gnawing suspicion that God is a giant vacuum-form 
machine. Everything in America pops and plops from 
heaven unto earth . And I feel surer in this conviction 
aller meditating upon one of His plastic prodigy, Mar-
Joe Gortner. Marjoe descends by way of his own film 
biography, "Marjoe." As a Pentecostal preaching child-
whiz grown into a Tommy Roc evangelist, he peddles 
dixie-cup religion to the poor saps of America. ror God 
and crisp $20 bills, he sara n wraps blubbery, syphlitic 
peopl . 

From old, crude colored news reels we see him from 
hiS b ginning, age four, shaking his finger, screaming 
for Christ, pooping the sax, and marrying sad sacks. Re-

lired at 14, beginning a comeback at 19, cur ly-top s es a 
shallow future on the Bible circuit. A hirley Temple 
who's outgrown his knickers, Marjoe tells us he wants 
to be an actor, or at least a rock'n'roll star . In fact he 
hopes this movie is his promo ticket Into groupiedom. 
And soon, with a Chelsea recording contract as social 
seccurity, Marjoe will make his Southland debut at the 
KROC Coliseum charity concert later thi s month . 

Like any good con artist, Marjoe is a success. Yet the 
documentary strives not 10 strip away his veneer, but 
rather to impress upon us consummate images of 
Americana religion . It is a snooty, elitist , " hip" flick . The 
makers, Howard Smith and Sally Kernochan , know this

Seerl and 
Not Heard ? 

Someday, ·f legal futurists have their way, it will be 
possible for courts of law throughout the U.S. to 
railroad deft·ndants through the paces of the legal 
process without ever having to listen to their outraged 
and unruly cries of protest . 

Their "courtroom of the future" is being bu ilt now, 
asnd will greatly facilitate the work of jurists who are 
obliged to try defendants like Bobby Seale of the Black 
Panthers or Ru chell Magee, who aggressively assert 
their rights or defy the court. 

Billed as " the most modern and advanced " cour-
troom in the nation, the $460,000 structure is a project 
of the University of the Pacific's McGeorgp School of 
Law and is scheduled for completion this June in 
Sacramento, California. 

The courtroom will have a glass-walled isolation 
booth through which defendants will be able to view 
court proceedings while listening to them through a 
one-way speaker. Those who do not speak English will 
be able to follow right along with the help of 
simultaneous interpretations piped into the booth in 
their native language. 

pectators who disrupt the trial will either be 
banished completely or exil d to a nearby room with 
clased-circuit TV coverage of the rourt. A sophisti ated 
security sys tem locks all doors automatica ll y and 
screens anyone pa sing through them for firearms. 

The courtroom is of circular design with a pedestal in 
the center for displaving evidence. The pede~tal mes b~

Late Notp.; From Thp Arena 

Elton John

The crowd was restless. Some squirmed in their seats. 
The front -row ticket holders were outrL ~~d at paying 
$6.50 for a view of the stage and not the performers. The 
Sports Arena "Peace Patrol " (alias the local goon squad 
a la 1965 varsity football squad style) hulked around the 
stage area . This stra nge scene was the setting for the 
Concert Associates bill of Family and the "one and 
only" r.lton John . 

Duf' to unfortunate circumstances (those being that 
the equipment truck broke down 125 miles east of San 
Diegol. Family, a British rock group for United Artists, 
was unable to perform. But all was not lost, yet. Linda 
Lewis, a fr iend traveling with Family, was presented to 
the audience. Accompanying hersel f on guitar and 
piano, she sa ng a variety of numbers. She showed a re-
markable vocal range as she quickly captiva ted the sell-
out crowd . 

After a brief break, the din in the Arena intensified. 
Finally, the spotlights cent red on the stage. Quickly, 
the back-up group for the "star" took their places on 
stage. A flash of purple sequins outshone t!l(' spotl ight. 
Elton John wa on stage. Resplendent in his ~uit , Elton 
John was greeted with screams and a mad ru ~h to the 
stage. eating hImself aftN the wild outburst of 
('nthusiasm, the piano began to spill out familiar

So of course Ezra Pound is dead now and what there 
is left of him is his poetry, some that is a monstrosity and 
some (more) that is the b st and most brilliant around . 
We also have the products of his influence on other 
major authors (Remember Eliot's Waste Land ? Pound 's 
too) and the conccrn he had with the development of 
IltE'rature, pros!' dnd pOE'try, in Europ and the Unit d 
States. Ther is al..,o his distasteful politics to rememb r 
with hi s years spent in i1 mental institution, his flam-

for Christi.mity, usu ry, and democracy. Takin~ ail as-

which jammed the International Sports Arena . The low 
hum of conversation heard throughout the per-
formances of the previous singers had vanished utterly. 

The group was the Moody Blues , The song was 
" Nights in White Satin ," 

It was the type of concert you go to hoping to hear at 
best five or six songs by the featured group, after 
lengthy appearances by others; but where your every 
expectation, and much more, is fulfilled and you are left 
on the edge of your seat with anticipation, wondering, 
" Which one will they do next?" And you know that, 
whatever the next one is, it will be a veritable work of 
art and, like those preceding it, will cast its sp II over 
you and transport you into another world . After it's 
over you feel that, even though you can't exactly put 
your fin ger on it, you have in some subtle way been 
changed and will never be th sa me again . 

These, at least, were some of my fee lings after emerg-
ing from the Moodi 5' concert Friday night , Nov. 3. 

They said it wa perhaps the best-attendpd concert 
ever held at the Arena . I believe it. By the time I arr ived 
(6:45) the floor was already about half- filled ; I slid into a 
sea t on one side, down low, and watchcd as during the 
next hour people continu('d to stream in until even the 
wats behind th!' starW Wf'rC' takC'n, Gradually the air be-
gan to fill with cigarptlp smokC', and frisbees and rubtwr

and love it. IntercUl into the record of Marjoe's last, rip-
off one-nlghters are a few hand-held bull sessions be -
tween the Kid and the celluloid corps. We are to know, 
and not forget , that Marjoe is cool. So are the film 
freaks. The folk s who come to listen to the brimstone 
spiel are wierd and stupid. And M arjoe is in no way like 
them . He sez he walks a fine line between them and a 
role as sneaky Pete exploiter. Same for the film freak s. 
Lov(', incense, wa terbeds is Marjoe's correct image. Hi s 
mental tran scendence is " prollen " in that he can sit 
around with the corps, in tye-died tank shirt and tour-
quoise jewele ry, jabbing hi own stage act : "Bustin ' 
heads and droppin' red s, breaking doors and bangin' 
whores." ext, at a neon light Hollywood be-in, a I w 
slea7Y strip groupies gct into movies by giggling with 
Marjoe . Marjoe is the hit pick of the week. 

Is this film hip or is it hype tripe? While watching 
those reviva l dingalings watching Marjoe do his schtick, 
I got to wondering who was sick, Is it those poor slobs, 
or Marjoe and the lluupe who know what th ey do and 
re li sh it, or us, suckpri inlo ogling at the miserable freak 
show? 

The movie on ev ry Icv I is a perver xploitation . 
Not only that, It' ~ boring. Ther '5 enough mat rial for a 
tight 40-minute short , but th rest is freak show fillN. It 
ooc'>n't mattN Th rC' are a few hallowed sr('nps that 
se ll . And we're so ld . ror kicks, they're hard to b!'at. The 
sp llN, producer Max Pall'vsky, smelled it. Hp sm!'lIs real 
good. With $20 million from IBM, he's Hollywood's hip 
opl tali st. He's brought li S " Rollingstone," "LA," and 
now corners the youth menia mart with "socia l" fli cks. 
Who wouldn' t pay to SI'P curly save his pet dog, see 
ladies fain t and exposf' thei r nylons at M arjoe's touch, 
seC' Marjoe count a bag of bucks soaked from th 
schmucks? Hee-h , giggle-giggle. Max laughs all the 
way to the bank, God's vacuum-form machine beg in s 
spitting vinyl discs, and MarJoe leads us into a sa ran -
wrapped Middle America n marsh. Instead of gaining 
distance, the movie be om s a tar baby, stu k like th 
r vival addicts in the black syrup of fat lady shyst rand 
h r pulsing "24 Hour Pray r rusad" halo. 

conti nued from page 10 
hi s inte nti ons, or eve n 
picked out a dozen state 
editors of widely variant 
ideas, does anyone really 
think they could give fair 
treatmen t to as many 
different views as are now 
expressed? 

Considering this, it seems 
pointless for Mr. Clolltz to 
complain about the pre~s 
not being "free." If he 
does, he in effect offers us a 
choice between Double-
think in which free dis-
cussion is censorship and 
wice wersa, or giving up any 
cha nge of using "free-
dom" to mean somethi ng 
ach ievable. I think it better 
to preserve some c lea r 
meaning for thi s word . In 
this case, I'd dPply it to any 
situ ati on in whi ch ex-
cha nge amo ng writers, 
printers, and readers IS not 
con trolled by th e force 
eithe r of cri minals or of th 
Idw, regard less of whether 
or not I Itke what is being 
Sdld-even to th e worst 
raris t o r class-centered 
paranoia. Part of being free 
i accepting the responsi-

bility of safeguarding your-
self against bad goods, ser-
vices, and ideas, through 
the exercise of your own 
judgm nt. I, at least, am not 
eager to be treated as the 
incompetent child of a pat-

ernalistic government. For 
if men cannot be trusted to 
be fair when they have only 
the power of private 
ci tiz ns, how can they be 
trusted when they have the 
much greater power of 

governmental officials? Mr, 
Clontz, happily, has al -
ready taken the remedy 
offered by a free press: he 
has publi sh d hi s own 
views for tho ~ who wish to

Testimony to San Diego City Council 
regarding La Jolla Shores Precise Plan 
Thursday, November 2, 1972 con tinu ed from page 3 
Mr. Mayor and members of the Council : 

I am the Reverend Leslie J. Atkinson, 
one of the campus ministers serving th 
University of California, San Diego. I live 
at 8854 Cliffridge Av('. which is with in the 
plan area , I am presently serving as 
Associate Moderator of the University 
Community Forum, an d as Chairman of 
the Committee on Church Planning of 
the San Di go ou nty Ecumenica l Con-
ference so I have some understanding of 
the planning process. 

I am by t rai ning a socia l ethicist and, as 
such, am concerned about the relation-
ships between people's state'ments and 
their acts. It was in this context that I 
opposed its adoption at th!' first Plan-
ning Commission hearing, and that I 
oppose its adoption now. Th(' pl.1n 01'-

• 

fore you makes a statement, then pro-
cl'eds to spell out its provisions in a 
manner that is inconsistent with that 
statement. 

The plan before you has as one of its 
tated object ives " To foster the develop-

ment of a racia lly, eth nically, and 
economically balancE'd community" (pg 
3) . Yet what the plan (ails for is not a 
balanced com munity, but more of what 
alrpady exists. I would call your atten-
tion to the fact that four of the six un-
developed areas described in thl' plan 
(all for the provision of two parking 
spaces per residence with an additional 
space per dwelling unit for gupsts and re-
creatIonal uses. This is not implement -
ing any kind of economic balanc!' that I 
know of, but the continuation at an

upper middl class living pattern . 
One way of achieving these kinds o f mixes IS in the 

use of mult i- famil y unils. Yet the plan statps that " the 
total number of dwelling units permitt d in the multi-
familyar as under existing zoning is excessiwe" (under-
lining mine) and that "future developr1ents should be 
m dlum density consistent with the La Jolla Com-
munity Plan and with the stable famil y character of the 
area" (pg. 6). Again I would question whether this is not 
aimpd at the continuance of the sam!' upper middlf' 
class liVIng patterns. 

Earlier te\timony before the Plan'1ing Commission 
and earlier foday in regards to multi - family units was 
confined almost eyclusively to hotel -motel a(comoda-
tions and AOt to any kind of permanpnt family ac-
comodatio,.. The implIcation s emrngl y to be drawn is 
that It is all r~ht to bring money, lots of it , as long as you 
leave it here. But no talk of an economic mix 

EarlIer testimony before the PlannIng Comml~sion 
was to the pOtnt that the La Jolla Shores Prpdse Plan wa~ 
consisten t ~it h the La Joll Cummunit y Plan . Yet I 
would ca ll your attention to tn foll owing stdtem!'nt 
from the La lalla CommunIty Plan ReSIdential Rf'('Qm-
mendallons : " An adequate dl ~tlib ution of a full range 
of housing types and valup~ '>hould bl' providf'd 
throughout the La Joll a ('Ommunlty" (pg 29, undprlin-
ing mine). 

At this point, there would arpear 10 be a consIder-
able gap between what the plan stat('\ as its objectlvf'~ 
and how it sees those objectives to be Implemented If 
indeed those objectives arf' to be Implem!'nted 

Now thp responsibi lit y for mixed houstng In thl' area, 
as well as throughout th(· req of thp citv, has come to 
res t WIth this council There arp a numbpr of peopl!' 
w,lt ch tng with Interest to see Just how far thf' gap be-
twppn "atempnt and act is with thl' oody. Thp cit)' has 
dpclared Itself to be 10 favor of a housing mIx on manv 

occa~iom. Therp have bepn many OP( l.udtiom of how 
oppn San Dlq~o IS in regard to houstng possibililips. 
And I would not detr~('t from them unn!'((!'ssaril~ BUI
