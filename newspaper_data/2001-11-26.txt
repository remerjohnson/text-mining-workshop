Amid lingering fears of anthrax-
comaminated mail , four suspicious 
packages identified at UCSD were 
reported to campus police in the 
last twO weeks. Of these four, one is 
now being stored in a freezer at the 
Environmcmal H ea lth & Safety 
facili ty on campus. 

The packages were reportedly 
found In the Institute of the 
Ameri ca;" T hormon H ospital, the 
Cognitive Science Building and in 
a Price Cenrer restroom. 

Receptionist Kristy Borman 
received the package reported at 
the Institute of the Americas.

uc 0 has revised its under-
graduate admissions policy to 
comply with the UC Board of 
Regents' newly adopted stan-
dards of comprehensive review. 

UCSD's new process, which 
will be implemented beginning 
fall 2002, will involve three 
"reviews," or phases. 

The initial review will consid-
er a mix of academic criteria. 
Applicants' grade point averages 
will be examined, along with test 
scores and the number of UC-
required A-G courses taken 
beyond the minimum required. 

UCSD admissions personnel

Joint venture aims to train 
professors, administrators 
ByTJ. TAWE 
Contributing Writer 

Recognizing a gro\ving need for 
better-trained community college 
professors and administrators in 
California's educational system, . 
California State University and the 
Uluversity of California agreed last 
week to create new joint doctorate 
programs in education . 

According to UC spokesman 
Michael Reese, the program's main 
goal is to provide students pursuing 
a doctorate in education with 
access to the extensive resources of 
both university systems. 

The program is designed primar-
ily to train future school administra-
tors and community college profes-
sors, Reese said, and will also help 
parts of California now underserved 
by both university systems. 

"The agreement builds on the 
mutual strengths of CSU and UC 
campuses while remaining consis-
tent with the basic tenets of the 
California Ma ter Plan for Higher 
Education," Reese said. 

The CSU and UC systems will 
CfC'dte a Joint board to seek out and 
oversee proposals for joint doctorate 
programs and will provide $4 mil -
lion in the first two years to fund 
such proposals. This board will be 

co-chaired by CSU Executive Vice 
C hance llor and Chief Academic 
Officer David S. Spence, and 
Provost and Senior Vice President 
for the UC system C. Judson King. 

The two systems will then estab-
lish a regional assessrncm process to 
guarantee that the leadership needs 
of grades K-12 and cornnlwuty col-
leges are matched with resources 
from both universi ty systems. 

Finally, the two university sys-
terns will be equal partners in creat-
ing and maintaining any new joint 
doctorate in education programs. 

J oint doctoral programs are not 
uncommon; according to the UC 
Office of the President, the UC and 
CSU systems already participate in 
13 such programs. From 1990 to 
2000, 281 doctoral students in UC-
CSU joint programs graduated , 34 
percent of which with education-
related degrees. 

Reese stressed that the doctorate 
of education program was in its ea r-
liest stages at this point, but hoped 
that the board could have some pro-
grams running by August 2002 . 

"We're reviewing different pro-
posals, determining what the vari-
ous needs are and forging details of 
these programs," he said. "We've

"There was nothing suspicious 
about it." Martin said. "When the

Martin said the package wi ll not be 
tested for anthrax. However. the letter 
will be kept in a sea led bag in a freez-

additional suspicious packages. 

"We probably have half a dozen in

"We are hanging onto them because

expensive and inconclusive as to posi-

The package reported at Thorn ton 
Hospital was brought in for testing by 
a concerned UPS driver. A Thorn ton 
Hospital representative said the driver 
and the package were both tested by a 
San Diego County hazardous materi-
als team. All tests for anthrax and 
odler hazardous materials came back 
negative. 

Thornton Hospital reports this as 
the first such incident at its faci lities.

"Students have come in thinking 
they might have smallpox," 
Ilcnclnckson said. "But none of the SIlI-

Ilendrickson said Student Health 
Services is ready to address medical 
problems stemming from bioterror. 

Though real, Hendrickson said dle 
threat should be kept in perspective.

Scripps chosen to monitor coastline pollution 
A new project led by researchers at the Scripps 

Instttutlon 01 Oceanography aims to reduce human 
exposure to beach contamination through a three-
pronged approach of real-time coastal monitoring. 
source identification and improved management 
and regulation. 
· The city of Imperial Beach awarded Scripps scien-

tiSts $750,000 to study coastal pollution as pa rt of a 
project funded by the State Water Resources Control 
Board and GCN. Gray Davis' Clean Beach Initiative. 

Parts of Imperial Beach's coastline were closed 
39 times in 2000 - more than half of these clos-
ings occurred during the peak tourist months of 
summer. The sources of bacterial contamination 
responsible for these closures are difficult to pin-
pOint due to the vanous possible sources including 
the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment 
Plant outfall, the Tijuana River outflow, northward 
flow of wastewater from Mexico and local runoff 
from Imperial Beach. 
· Under the. newly funded project, Scripps scien-

tists have deSigned a system for monitoring coastal 
CIrculation and movement of distinct water types. 
The "Coastal Monitoring System" combines data 
from radar instruments that map surface ocean cur-
rents and a suite of in-water instrumentation. 

Study: GPA better predictor of 
minority success than S.A.T. I 

High-school grades are far more reliable than SAT. 
I scores in predicting how well minority students will do 
in college, according to a new study by researchers at 
UC DaVIS. Merna Villarelo, a professor emerita of 
microbiology at UC Davis, presented the findings Nov. 
17 a~ a. con~erence, "Rethinking the SAT. in University 
Admissions, sponsored by the Academic Senate 
Cenler for Faculty Oulreach at UC Santa Barbara. 

The researchers, who examined the college per· 
formance of 1,274 minority students who entered 
UC Davis asfreshmen from 1988 through 1994, 
found that high school preparation was associated 
With perSistence and performance from basic sci-
ence classes all the way through to ~raduation . 
Villarelo said the study indicates that high school 

~PA IS the Single most Important predictor of all pos· 
Itlve academiC outcomes measured. 
· In a study with implications for university admis· 

Slon procedures, Villarejo and Barlow found that 
higher SA.T. scores did correlate with students' suc-
cess in basic math and chemistry, as well as their 
chances of graduating with at least a B average -
the minimum required for most graduate and pro-
fessional programs. However, the study found that 
high-school GPA far ,outweighed SA. T. scores in pre-
dicting the students chances of success in college. 

M~reov~r, the study found that a program of acade-
mic ennchment and personal support can largely 
compensate for poor high school preparation.

the California Institute of Technology and Ha rvey 
Mudd College. Each team was given one computer 
and StX problems to solve in five hours. UCSD Paper 
was the onfy team to solve five problems in the allot-
led time. 

. An intra-UCSD competition sponsored by The

Police intervene in car 
chase, arrest two men 
Two charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon; driver charged with D UI 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A car chase ended in the res-
idence area of Earl Warrren 
College when San Diego police 
arrested two male nonaffiliates 
for assault with a deadly 
weapon. 

The two men, 19-year-old 
Eric Bradford and 21 -year-old 
Kevin Burch, chased a UCSD 
student from Westfield 
Shoppingtown UTC mall to the 
Warren college area, according 
to police. T he driver, Bradford. 
was also charged with driving 
under the influence of alcohol 
and for felony evasion of a peace 
officer. 

San Diego Police Sgt. Tom 
Morris said Bradford and Burch 
came in contact with the UCSD 
student's Jeep near UTe. 
According to Morris, when the 
suspects began to chase the Jeep 
and threaten the safety of the 
female driver and her male pas-
senger, it became assaul t. 

According to police, the cars 
then headed acro s campus, 
entering by Campus Point Drive 
near East Parking and the Preuss 
School. The cars sped over the 
freeway overpass and headed 
toward Warren college. 

Morris said dIe Jeep sta lled 
near the Warren Mall on Voigt 
Drive, where Bradford and 
Burch exi ted a white 1999 

Toyota Supra, headed toward the 
Jeep and began to pound on the 
windows and soft top. T he Jeep's 
driver eventually was able to 
restart the car and sped off 
toward the Marshall campus 
where the passenger in the Jeep 
dialed 911 , Morris said. 

UCSD police said a squad 
car headed toward Warren, 
where it caught up with the 
Toyota, which had fa llen behind 
the Jeep, and that the driver of 
the car refused to yield to the 
officers and ran several stop 
signs. 

Bradford , heading toward 
Warren college on Voigt Drive, 
made a left on Equality Lane and 
headed toward the end of the 
cui-dc-sac where he and Birch 
exi ted the car. 

Warren student Ruhul Ka liki 
described the event as he wit-
nessed it from the window of his 
apartment. 

"I heard the cars pulling up, 
screeching. He drove up there 
and stopped at the barriers," 
Kaliki said. 

Kaliki said he saw Bradford 
and Burch get out of the car and 
go into the Warren residence area. 

"1 kind of wished I would 
have cha ed after the guys but 
they caught them anyway, so it's 
cool," Kali ki said. 

Accor.ding to police, the men 
exited thei r car and walked 
toward the west entrance of 

Goldberg Hall. The men were 
approached by Resident Security 
Officer Jose Bonilla, who said 
they appeared intoxicated, and 
Bonilla began to approach the 
men as a typical alcohol-related 
stop. Soon after, the police arrived 
and Bradford and Burch were 
questioned and officers identified 
them as the men involved in the 
cha c. Bradford and Burch were 
then arrested and transported to 
Central Jail. 

Witnesses reported that 
Bradford and Burch appeared 
calm during questioning and did 
not have the demeanor of people 
who would soon be arrested . 
One Warren student said 
Bradford was smoking a cigarette 
while ta lki ng to the police, just 
prior to the arrest. 

Morris, who was at the scene, 
said it was "almo t like a 'why are 
you harassing us' type of thing." 

Morris also said that 
Bradford, the driver, was obvi-
ously intoxicated. Bradford had a 
blood alcohol coment of .08 per-
cent, exceeding the legal limit for 
a driver. 

Both Bradford and Burch 
were arraigned and pleaded not 
guilty to all charges. Bradford IS 
scheduled for a Dec. 5 court date 
and is housed at the George 
Bailey Jail in Gtay Mesa. Burch is 
at the South Bay Jail in Chula 
Vista and is scheduled for a court 
hearing Nov. 28.

I~· ~ ~ ~ Comprehensive pro review brings the promise of a more interesting student body 
By MARY-ONEUA ESTUDILLO 
Staff Writer 

On Nov. IS , the UC Regents passed the 
"comprehensive review" policy, applicable 
to incoming applicants in fall 2002. 
Endorsed by the Academic Senate, UC 
admissions policy will change from being a 
"two-tiered" process to "comprehensive 
review, " which means that all students will 
now be evaluated holistica lly on thei r acade-
mic and nonacademic achievements . 

Comprehensive review is elCpected to 
enhance campus selectivity, diversity and 
livelihood by changing the makeup of the 
stutlents admined. 

Many critics say that comprehensive 
review will lower the standards for academic 
excellence, and that it is a shameless last 
grasp for something similar to affirmative 
action. Both assumptions are wrong and 
have been made from a surface evaluation of 
what comprehensive review actually means. 

It is important to note that UC President 
Richard C. Atkinson sa id the only change 
that will occur is "that all the selection crite-
ria wi ll now be ava ilable for campuses to use 
in selecting all their students, rather than a 
subset of them." 0 eligibility requirements 
or crite ria will change. All students have to 
take the same coursework and be eva luated 
by the same UC numerical eligibi li ty index. 

T he UC admissions process is currently 
two-tiered: Students in the first tier are 
admitted to a UC school solely on their aca-
demic history and achievements alone. 

Comprehensive review makes up the 
other half of the UC ad missions process.-
The econd tier of studcnts is evaluated on 
the hasis of 14 other criteria, taking into 
account aspects such as class rank, quality of 
education , marked improvements, pecial 
talents, awards, etc., in addition to CPA and 
5landardit.ed test scores. 

ComprehenSive review allows for a more 

diverse student population in background, 
experiences and interests - in addition, of 
course, to strong academic performance. It 
aims to fill UC campuses with more well-
rounded students, active and dynamic pro-
ponents of campus life and representation. 

So what if not everyone will have a 4.4 
GPA? That doesn't mean that such students 
will not be strong contributors to the quali-
ty of campus life and academics. 

According to Atkinson, comprehensive 
review seeks "thoroughly qualified students 
who demonstrate the promise to make great 
contributions to the university community 
and to the larger society beyond." He added, 
"We believe this policy sends a strong signal 
that UC is looking for students who have 
achieved at high levels and, in doing so, have 
challenged themselves to the greatest extent 
possible." 

When admissions officers evaluate an 
applicant now, not only will they look at 
grades and scores to predict a student's 
potential contributions, they will also look at 
other qualities such as leadership, motiva-
tion and initiative. Considering these factors 
on top of academia has always been a major 
part of other top schools' admission policies. 

Comprehensive review of all incoming 
applicants is used by many of the' country's 
most elite and selective private and public 
universities such as Stanford, Harvard and 
Yale . In that company, comprehensive 
review cannot be all that bad for setting an 
academic standard. 

If it is equality that concerns people, 
implcmenting full comprehensive review for 

·all applications will make the admission 
process as fair at it has ever been. The old, 
two-tiered system is, in actuality, unfair : It 
gauged the achievements of potential stu-
dents unequally based upon either past aca-
demic achievement or criteria such as

Chan~g admissions 
policies creates loopholes for 

applicants, destroying objectivity 
By DANIEL WArn 
Staff Writer 

The UC Regents, in altering admissions 
policy to affect the racial mix of the univer-
sity, have lifted the lid on Pandora's box. 

The new "comprehensive review" policy, 
inspired by ~e regents' urge to modify the 
university's racial composition, eliminates 
the previous mandate that SO to 7 S percent 
of an entering class be admitted based exclu-
sively on academic considerations. 
Comprehensive review places greater 
emphasis on extracurricular activities and 
applicants' personal statements. 

As a place of learning, a university should 
concern itself primarily with the academic 
capabilities of its students - not their abilities 
to fabricate anecdotal "tales of struggle" in 
their personal' statements, and certainly not 
their 10 years spent playing Pee Wee football. 

Despite UC President Richard C . 
Atkinson 's claims that comprehensive 
review will not introduce race as a factor in 
admissions, the fact remains that compre-
hensive review was designed to change the 
university's social composition. 
. Some astute regents grew worried when 
they learned that, at a UC Irvine practice-
application evaluation session, more than 
half the evaluators worked in the university's 
outreach program, whose goals include 
increasing black and Latino enrollment. 
While minority recruitment and retention is 
important, employees whose job description 
is to increase minority enrollment at all costs 
should not sit in judgment over applicants. 

At the UCI evaluation session, Regent 
John Moores said readers were especially 
interested in students' written personal 
statements, according to the San Jose 
MerC71ry Nnus. Personal statements consist 
of an applicant's endeavor in creative writ-
ing, designed to bludgeon the reader with 
emotional stories of hardship, disability and 

overcoming adversity - reality be damned. 
Personal statements can be plagiarized or 
full of lies, and they are not verified for truth 
or accuracy. A bootlegged essay copied from 
the Internet is not the best way to evaluate 
an applicant's eligibility. 

Indeed, the personal statement is the eas-
iest portion of the UC application to fake . 
The hardest parts: the GPA and the S.A.T., 
S.A.T. II and A.C .T. scores. Comprehensive 
review, coupled with the proposed elimina-
tion of the S.A.T., largely renounces these 
forgery-proof evaluation methods. 

Personal statements are by no means 
effective indicators of applicants' future per-
formance in a university. A personal state-
ment describing the life of a bedridden, 
blind hemophiliac who managed to finish 
high school and overcome his ailments 
through sheer force of will to become the 
student body president and homecoming 
king could be entirely made up. The appli -
cant could have the bare minimum test 
scores and GPA needed to enter the UC sys-
tem, totally unprepared for college-level 
work. But the evaluator wouldn 't care; he 
might only see an applicant .who overcame 
adversity and whose (fabricated) life experi-
ences would add to the university'S diversity. 

In attempting to justify his proposal, 
Atkinson employs the "all the cool people 
are doing it, so I should, too" argument .. 

:'We are not doing something creative," 
he said. "We're simply moving in the direc-
tion of every competitive university in the 
United States." Atkinson cited Harvard, 
Yale , Stanford and the University of 
Michigan as examples of schools that use 
comprehensive review. . 

As private schools, Harvard, Yale and 
Stanford are bound by different rules and 
held to different standards than public 
schools like the University of California.

Legality of substances is disparate 
Some legal drugs are more harmful than illegal ones 
By MATTHEW LEPORI 
Staff Writer 

Of the three highly popular 
recreational drugs in America, twO 
are legal, and one is nor. We'll call 
the two legal drugs Drug A and 
Drug B, and the illegal drug wi ll be 
called Drug C. 

First, we will examine the nega-
tive health effects of using these 
three drugs. 
. Drug to. is the cause of 400,000 

deaths in America each year. It is 
the leading preventable cause of 
death in America and costs the 
health induStry $SO billion annual-
fy. Each year, this drug kills more 
people than AIDS, alcohol, drug 
abuse, car crashes, murders, sui -
cides and fires, combined. 

Drug A causes multiple types of 
cancer, including lung, throat and 
mouth cancers. This drug is the 
direct ca use of emphysema, a dis-
ease contracted by half a million 
Americans each year. Emphysema 
debil itates the respiratory tract, 
leading to what has been described 

Con: 
Process for admission 
makes liars' work easier 
Continued from page 4 
Whereas the Ivy Leaguers routine-
ly admit students based on the like-
lihood and probable size of their 
families' furure financial contribu-
tions or the prestige of their family 
connections (think Al Gore at 
Harvard, George W. Bush at Yale 
and Chelsea Clinton at Stanford), 
public universities have an obliga-
tion to the taxpayers to provide an 
unbiased, fair and objective means 
of obraining an education. 

The University of Michigan, 
the only public university on 
Atkinson's short list, is currently 
fighting two simultaneous lawsuits 
regarding its admission policies -
not quite the good example 
Atlonson was looking for. 

Comprehensive review converts 
what was once an objective process, 
using standardized objective mea-
sures of an applicant's proven acad-
emic ability, into a biased, subjec-

as "breatlling through a straw." 
The drug also affects other areas 

of the body, including · the heart, 
brain and bones. It contains toxic 
chemicals and impairs the immune 
system. 1\vice as many people who 
usc Drug A get heart disease than 
those who do nor. Drug A leads to 
strokes. It also leads to rheumatoid 
arthritis in women; those who use 
tllis drug have double the risk of 
developing this disease. 

Drug A damages fetuses . 
Mothers who use Drug A are three 
times as likely to have their babies 
die of Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome than mothers who do 
not. Infants born to mothers who 
use Drug A can have reduced lung 
function for years after they are 
born, and suffer from deformities 
of the mouth and palate. 

This drug also has a strong rela-
tionship with miscarriages. In a 
Nnu England J Olln/al of Medicine 
study, 80 percent more miscar-
riages occurred among women who 
used Drug A than women who did 
not. In fact, women who use this 

tive evaluation of an applicant's 
propensity to lie on his application. 
Even if an applicant does not bla-
tantly pad his resume, the process is 
still biased because the essays and 
applications are sti ll subject to the 
biases of those who evaluate them. 
It is difficult to administer this style 
of evaluation evenhandedly because 
each evaluator has a different view-
point and would judge each appli -
cation differently, whereas there is 
only one way to interpret a numer-
ical value assigned to an applicant 
through his test scores or GPA. 

Comprehensive review would 
be a bad idea no matter when it is 
implemented, but to do so in the 
middle of the college application 
"season" is downright cruel. The 
deadline for UC applications is at 
hand, and most high school seniors 
have completed their applications. 
Some have already submitted them. 
Then the comprehensive review 
bombshell is dropped, and those 
who failed to write a Pulitzer-wor-
thy personal statement are screwed. 
Yet the students who procrastinated 
are rewarded for their dawdling 
because they now have time to find 

drug arc twice as likely to have a 
miscarriage than women who u 'e 
cocaine. 

Moving along, Drug B also has a 
direct link to various ca ncers. 
Seventy-five percent of esophageal 
cancer is related to use of Drug B, 
and half of cancers of the mouth 
and throat are linked to its usc. 

Drug B has also demonstrated a 
causal relationship with liver dis-
ease, called alcohol-induced liver 
disease. Cirrhosis of the liver, the 
term used for alcohol 's effect on 
this organ, is one of the leading 
causes of death in America . 

Like Drug A, this drug has also 
been linked to birth defects. It has a 
syndrome named after its effects. 
When used by pregnant women, 
Drug B leads to mental retardation, 
growth deficiencies, central ner-
vous system dysfunction, craniofa-
cial abnormalities and behavioral 
problems. 

Now for the third and illegal 
drug, Drug C. While Drug C con-

someone to ghost-write their sud-
denly significant essays. 

If the regents insist on applying 
this hiased policy, they should at 
least put it off until next yea r, and 
not surprise this year's applicants a 
week before the deadline. 

The right means of increasing 
diversity is through a fair, objective 
program, such as the Dual 
Admissions Plan, by which the top 4 
percent of students in each 
California high school is guaranteed 
admission to a UC campus. Students 
then have a chance to succeed with-
in their local context, without having 
to worry about S.A. T. scores, AP 
classes or inflated GPAs. 

"Holistic" or "comprehensive" 
eval uations open the door to 
administrative bias and forged 
applications. This half-hearted run 
around Proposition 209 should be 
seen for what it is: At~inson 's 
attempt to appear sympathetic to 
those who want increased minority 
enrollment by any means necessary. 

The brief reign of fairness and 
objectivity in UC admissions is 
coming to an end. Pandora's box is 
open.

tains carcinogens, a causal relation-
ship between its use and cancer has 
not been established. Using this 
drug leads to a greater risk of bron-
chitis, sore throat and respiratory 
inflammation. It leads to a short-
term drop in hormones that govern 
development and growth, lowers 
sperm production in males and can 
alter the menstrual cycle in women. 
Ilowcvcr, in adults, the lattcr three 
health effects are only temporary. 

Other negative effects of using 
this drug include forgetfulness, 
reduced concentration and anxiety 
attacks. 

Various negative effects have 
also been attributed to this drug, 
including birth defects, brain dam-
age, reduced testosterone and 
increased drug abuse problems. 
However, recent studies have 
begun to refute these claims. 

Another disputed side effect of 
using Drug C is reduced hand-eye 
coordi nation and motor skills, 
resulting in poor driving perfor-
mance and reaction times. In recent 
srudies and reports, using this drug 
and then driving has proved to be 
far less of a hazard than when peo-
ple use Drug B and then drive, 
however. 

In 1990-1991, the National 
Highway Transportation Safety 
Administration performed a study 
in seven states, attempting to find a 
relationship between car accidents 
and Drugs Band C. Drug B was 
found to be a factor in 52 percent of 
crashes, while Drug C was only a 
factor in 7 percent of them. The 
report concluded that Drug B was 
by far the dominant drug-related 
cause of accidents. It also conclud-
ed that there was no relationship 
between Drug C and fatal automo-

QmCK TURNAROUND 

bile accidents. 
The three drugs are, in order, 

tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. 
The first twO are legal, the third is 
illegal. 

After viewing the evidence, it 
seems tha t the legali ty of these 
three drugs seems to contradict 
both common sense and medical 
results. Both tobacco and alcohol 
are linked to multiple cancers, birth 
defects, and cost the health indus-
try billions of dollars each year. 
Marijuana, on the other hand, leads 
to relatively minor health effects, 
such as slight respiratory ailments 
- yet it is illegal. 

The alcohol and 
tobacco industries 

spend millions of 
dollars each year in 
contributing to and 

lobbying Congress. So 
far in the 2001-2002 

election cycle, 
tobacco companies 

have made $2.2 
million in political 

contributions. 

Tobacco and alcohol are 
unquestionably more deadly than 
marijuana. In fact, both tobacco 
users and alcohol users are known 
to cause death to other people. 
There is no known relationship 
between marijuana use and death 
for those around the user. 

The force behind this is money. 
The alcohol and tobacco industries 
spend millions of dollars each year 
in contri buting to and lobbying 
Congress. So far in the 2001-2002 
election cycle, tobacco companies 
have made $2 .2 million in political 
contributions. 

Since 1997, the tobacco indus-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

try has given more than $18 million 
to Congressional representatives 
and political parties. 

Since 1999, the four largest cig-
arette companies have spent $44 
million in lobbying Congress. 

Alcohol companies are no bet-
ter. In the period between 1987 and 
1997, these companies gave $26 
million to members of Congress 
and their political parties. 

The most flagrant example of 
"buying" favor in Congress 
occurred in 1997, when the House 
Appropriations Committee lcilled a 
bill that would use the media to 
warn young people against the use 
of alcohol. That year, the members 
of that committee were given 
$300,000 by alcohol companies. 

Obviously, marijuana growers 
are not contributing money to 
Congress. This a factor in the ille-
gality of marijuana. Money buys 
votes. 

The answer to all of this is sim-
ple: Make the system fair. Either 
make all three of these drugs ille-
gal, or make them all legal. Since 
everyone in America knows how 
well prohibiting alcohol went, I 
would suggest the latter option: 
Legalize pot. 

Like drivers who constantly 
ignore speed limi t laws, which 
resulted in the government raising 
speed limits on highways, people 
have ignored the prohibition on 
marijuana for years. It is time to 
eliminate this useless law. 

The policy on marijuana only 
results in billions of dollars in costs 
to our government, from the price 
of court procedures and imprison-
ing marijuana users. 

It is simple logic here, and it is 
time the government realized this. 
Legalize pot and eliminate this 
problem in America. Doing so will 
save the government millions of 
dollars annually, free up jails and 
stop millions of Americans from 
having to sneak around in order to 
enjoy this innocuous drug.

How can the old system be

of students are judged on two dif-

when the student does not know

strength of the admitted class, as 
measured by traditional academic 
criteria, increased under the pro-
posed comprehensive review sys-
tem. 

How would this benefit a 
school like UCSD? Be honest: 
How many times have you 
thought, "Our campus is too 
bland, too quiet?" Under com-
prehensive review, UCSD would 
see an influx of students who are 
more than just their GPAs and 
S.A.T. scores, and who would 
have moce to offer than boosting 
UCSD's academic average. 
UCSD srudents would not only 

see an increase in 
va lued much 
more than sec-
ond-tier students, 
and what would 
be left would be a 
caste-like system, 
unequal as ever.

things, will take

be evaluated on everything that 
they put down on their applica-
tion, not just parts of it. 

While it is of vital concern to 
most that some students who 
would have been admitted 
through the old process will not 
be admitted in the new, and stu-
dents who would not have been 
admitted will now find themselves 
in the UC system, the odds of 
that happening are relatively 
small. According to a study based 
on a simulation done at UC 
Berkeley, only 4 percent of

would be denied in the new sys-
tem. Furthermore, the study

prospective students to branch 
out of their books and understand 
that while scores and gradeS" are, 
indeed, important, they alone will 
not substantiate a thorough edu-
cation and college experience. 

The University of California's 
decision demonstrates a definitive 
stand on the students it wants. It 
is certainly clear that its adminis-
trators believe srudents with a 
wide range of gifts to offer are 
those who will find success in the 
UC system.

Randall Souviney, director of 
the Teacher Education Program at 
UCSD, agreed that the venture is

regarding the listing of candidates' 
slates on the ballot. 

Independent candidate Matt 
Bechtel complained to the A.S. 
Judicial Board last year that then-
Elections Manager Vince Vasquez 
mishandled the matter. 

"The recent revision to the

bias made during the last A.S. elec-

"Although there is no way to 
reverse the unfair and biased deci-
sions [Vasquez] made toward me, 
this amendment will help limit the

debate last year centered around

Simulations conducted by the 

admissions deparonent this sum-
mer found that the majority of sru-
dents woul.d sti ll come from major 
areas of California, including the 
Los Angeles area and the San 
Francisco Bay Area, Brown said. 

The old system of admissions at 
UC D, which was mandated by 
the SP-I legislation that outlawed 
affirmative action, consisted of a 
two-tiered review of applicants. 
Fifty percent of those admitted to 
UCSD were accepted on purely 
academic standards, the minimum 
number required by SP-1. The 
other half went through review and 
reading. 

"What we've done now is shift 
from 50-50 to a broader review of 
the larger applicant pool," Brown 
said. 

The admissions envirOilment at

is still too early to see any effects 
the new joint doctorate program

program, or on how UCSD cur-

repair this rift. 
"Everyone has an opportunity to 

say something and get infonnation 
out to the voters," Goodwin said. 

Parent said he thinks this is a 
more fair way of conducting elec-
tions. 

"The burden of information is 
no longer on a rave card, but on the 
quality of a candidate's back-
ground," he said. 

According to Goodwin, the leg-
islation was submitted recently 
because candidates are "not in the 
heat of election shenanigans." 

Some students have said the 
change is positive, because they say 
it fo rces voters to learn about the 
candidates rather than just voting 
for slate names they recognize. 

"A lot of times when people see 
the slate names they vote on the slate 
and not the person," said Muir 
senior Catherine Medrano. "This 
way, if they include the statement, 
[voters] will be forced to look at each 
individual runner. It makes more 
sense to have it that way." 

UCSD is becoming increasi ngly 
competitive. Brown said that 11 ,000 
applicants to UCSD last year had 
4.0 grade point averages or better. 

"You have to look at other factors 
when it's so competitive," she said. 

Brown also denied allegations 
that the new program is designed to 
recruit minorities, saying that the 
new admissions policy adheres to 
Proposition 209. 

"It is n{lt a Lack door to affirma-
tive action," she said. "I think the 
changes [ethnicallyl are going to be 
marginal." 

UCSD will be hiring more 
readers for the application process. 
Retired faculty, as well as high 
school counselors, will be asked to 
read applications for undergradu-
ate admis ion. 

"This year we're planning to 
read over 30,000 files to admit our 
freshman class," Brown said. 

systems currently have over 
500,000 smdents in attendance. 

"The program will provide a 
sound and fiscally respon ible 
stra tegy to address the leadership 
needs of K-12 and community 
college educators," Reese said. 
"We believe [this program] is in 
the best interests of California's 
educators, the faculty of our two 
institutions and the people of 
California. "

to wait until the last possible 
moment to learn a quarter's worth 
of work. 

Ronald T.e. Boyd wrote in his 
article, "Improving Your Test-
Taking Skills," that it is best to 
study from the beginning of the 
course. 

"It is smart to prepare a li ttle bit 
.each day," Boyd's article reads. 
"Preparing for a test gradually lets 
you absorb the material, make con-
nections between concepts and 
draw conclusions. Studying each 
subject every night will save you 
the agony of having to cram on the 
night before a test." 

Such preparation can help elim-
inate the stress rcsulting from the 
feeling of being unprepared. 

Ben Mlynash, a Muir junior, can 
attest to the aftereffects of wai ting 
until the last minute to study. 

"Procrastination is an addic-
tion," he says. "Once you start, you 
do not go back, and when you real-
ize it, you arc screwed." 

T hird, study groups can be 
useful when used as more than a 
means to socialize and procrasti-
nate. 

Diane Loulou's article, "Making 
the A: How To Smdy for Tests," 
states that "study groups allow stu-
dents to combine resources; mem-
bers share all academic goal and 
provide support and encourage-
nlent." 

Loulou also sugge ts "an agcnda 
for each meeting to avoid wasting 
tinlc." 

Revelle junior E.ric Gorinstein 
has a similar belief toward srudy 
groups.

Studying: 
Tips for successful 
efforts under stress 
Continued from page 1 0 

"They're great as long as you've 
studied before getting there." 
Gorinstein says. "I feel that they 
are better ' for review Dr just 
approaching the material from a 
new perspective but not for learn-
ing." 

Fourth, it is crucial to be orga-
nized. Having legible and detailed 
notes can provide an added source 
of material to learn from. Books 
sometimes assume the reader 
knows some previous information. 
Often in lecture, teachers go over 
the material in the reading. but in 
more detail and with better expla-
nations. 

Said Marshall' senior Elana 
Segal, '" outline lecture notes and 
compare them with the tens in 
order to understand a professor's 
teaching style." 

Fifth, it is pertinent to under-
stand what type of test the final is 
going to be. There are many types 
of tests. Each type of test requires 
diffcrcnt tactics for test prepara -
lion and performance. Loulou's 
article suggests the following tips 
to effectively master the different 

types of tests professors throw at 
students. 

Multiple choice: When faced 
with a multiple choice test and two 
answers seem alike. choose one of 
the two similar answers. 

True/false: If a question has the 
word "never." "rarely" or "always" 
in it. usually the question is false. 

Open-book: Boolanark impor-
tant pages and write down formulas 
that are necessary on a separate 
sheet of paper to save time. 

Short answer: Use flashcards to 
study. This will help the student 
identify key words that might need 
to be defined on a test. 

Essay: Make an outline before 
writing the actual paper. When 
forming the paper. it is important 
to get to the point and restate the 
question at the beginning. 

When asked what her favorite 
type of test is, Muir junior Korin 
Lee responded. '" think multiple-
choice questions have their benefits 
because you have a 25 percent 
chance of guessing the correct 
answer. However, short answer 
questions allow much room for 
bluffing. so both have their bene-
fits ." 

Many UCSD students find that 
different testing situations suggest 
different studying approaches. As 
for which strategy will prove most 
useful - only time will tcll. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Co-op: 
Organization often dash-
es with administration 
Continued from page 9 
them aware of organizations that 
address certain issues - generally 
liberal ones. 

"' like their flyers about activist 
groups and how to get involved 
with different groups." Muir 
senior Christina said. "You don't 
get too much of that point of view 
anywhere else on campus." 

A point of pride at the Food 
Co-op is that despite its commit-
ment to low prices, it is financially 
self-sufficient. It can prove diffi -
cult to sell health food at a low 
cost. 

The Food Co-ops assets are 
modest: As of June 30. they totalled 
$15.000 in furniture, refrigerators, 
office equi pment, products and 
cash in the bank. The profit it gen-
erates i enough to cover its almost 
$250,000 in annual expen es. 

However, emergencies do hap-
pen. The University Centers 
Advisory Board paid for tlle co-op's 
tile floor and the oversight commit-
tee paid for its installation. The 
head of the student centers who 
also pitches in every once in a while 
to help maintain the facilities. 

Despite this, the Food Co-op 
tries to maintain autonomy from 
university-affiliated bodies. ' n 
fact, over the 20 years of the co-
op's existence at UCSD, it has had 
several clashes with school ad min-
istrators over the use of student 
fees and the administrative control 
of student facilities . 

The Student Cooperative 
Union is an advocacy group for stu-
dents' interests. They have histori-
cally argued that student fees are 
increased to support projects initi-
ated by the administration, which 
suldents have been convinced are 
important and necessary. 

The projects are supported by 
student referendums. The union 
argues the referendums are unfair-
ly promoted because of the use of 
administrative clout and propa-
ganda to generate student support 
for certain issues. The building of 
RlMAC Arena and the use of the 
Price Center by commercial busi-
nesses were two uch contested 
items. 

The union h3 also had an 
ongoing conflict with the univer-
sity over the autonomy of the stu-
dent centers. The University 
Centers Board was origina ll y 
independent of the university 
administration and made decisions 
regarding the student centers, 
including the co-ops.

FEATURES 13 

This board was changed to the 
current University C('nters 
Advisory Board. which plays a 
slightly less direct role in the run-
ning of the centers. The board 
makes n.:commendations, which 
the ad ministration can either heed 
or discard. 

The co-op may be unorthodox 
in its organization and subject to 
conflict with tlle admi nistration. 
but students enjoy it nonetheless. 

'" come here more often than 
other places on campus because 
it's chea per, healthier and ' 3m not 
supporting big business, but 3 co-
op - and 50-cent bagels are good 
tOo," one student commented . 

And it seems like the employ-
ees have fun .

l4 SPORTS 

Basketball: 
Freshman scores 15 
points for UCSD 
Continued from page 16 
sti ll ineffective as UCSD began 
the half with a steal and scored the 
first three points to take a 30-29 
lead. 

"\Vc wanted to make sure to 
bring the same intensity [as in the 
Hrst hal~," Ginn said. 

After the twO teams traded 
leads, SDSU's Missy Shomaker -
who came off the bench for the 
Aztecs and finished tied for the 
team-high with 13 points - knot-
ted the game at 35 apiece with a 
fast-break layup. She then traded 
baskets with UCSD's Nicholle 
Bromley; when Bromley hit a 
three to put the Tritons up 38-35, 
Schomaker answered with a three-
pointer to tie , then Bromley drove 
to the hoop for another field goal 
and Schomaker answered on the 
other end of the court wi th a 
jumper to tie the game at 40. 

After the two teams battled 

back and forth for several min-
utes, Bromley again ignited the 
Tritons with a basket to give 
UCSD the lead, 54-52. UCSD 
didn't relinquish that lead for the 
rest of the game, despi te a last-
ditch attempt by the Aztecs to 
come back from a 59-52 deficit, 

'Our starters didn't 
come ready to play; I 

think we took this 
team for granted ... 
our starters in the 
first half didn't do 

what they were 
supposed to do.' 

-Barb Smith 
SDSU head basketball coach 

which was helped by UCSD's per-
sistent free-throw shooting strug-
gles. The Tritons finished 12 for 
27 from the line. 

However, after Aztec Claire 
Swinbank scored to draw SDSU to 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

within one at 59-60, Folc grabbed a 
key rebound with 33.6 seconds left 
and was fouled by SDSU. After 
making one of two free throws, Fok 
then stole the inbound pass and was 
sent to the line again. This time she 
iced both shots to produce the final 
point total. 

Malone gave credit for the vic-
tory to the Tri ton offense. 

"We ran our offense effectively 
- that was the difference," she said. 

But Ginn gave credit to a differ-
ent source. 

"I'd like to thank the San Dirgo 
Ullio11- Tribllnr," she sa id. "They 
wrote an article sayi ng we would 
be an easy victory for SDSU, 
which we posted in our locker 
room. It was a good motivating 
factor for us." 

The Tritons will be looking to 
continue their winning streak and 
learn from SDSU's mistake when 
they hit the road Tuesday to take 
on Division III University of 
Redlands. 

"[This win) gives us a boost," 
Malone said. "It answers a lot of 
questions about playing in our con-
ference." 

Bring it: UCSO's Nlcholle Bromley, who led the Tritons with 16 pOints in their victory over SOSU, looks to pass against 
SOSU' ~ Tanlsha Knight while teammate Maya Fok tries to get open fo r a pass.

Because: 
Sports predictions for the 
upcoming year 
Continued from page 16 
same time, a sad day for UCSD stu-
dents who now have to cope with 
the fact that UC irvine's basketball 
team could lcick the crap out of ours. 

Pro basketball will offer an 
interesting race. The Lakers are 
the best team in basketball right 
now, and that's not just a statistic. 
Los Angeles has actually improved 
on irs dominant team of a year 
ago. The team has gotten much 
more athletic and has a solid sup-
porting cast to go along with 
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe 

. Bryant, who are incidentally first 
and third, respectively, in the 
league's scoring leaders. The 
Lakers added aging Mitch 
Richmond, who can be another 
scorer for a team that has relied on 
only two people for so long. 

Sacramento is still another year 
away from dcthroning the champs. 
Both Minnesota and San Antonio 
wil! give chase from the Midwest, 
but won't be enough. Milwaukee 
will be the team from the East, but 
just doesn't have the horses to keep 
the mighty Lakers from a three-
peat. 

While I readily admit to not 
knowing a whole lot about college 
baseball, I know that San Diego 
State will be much improved with 
Tony Gwynn as the Aztecs' new 
manager. Tony is one of the best 
baseball gtlys of all time. He knows 
his stuff and if he can impart only a 
fraction of his ocean of baseball 
wits Onto these young men, San 
Diego State will soon turn into a 
major powerhouse in Division I 
college baseball. 

I am much more informed on 
the pro ranks of baseball. While it 
is still a bil early to make \"'orld 
Series predictions, I can make a few 
other speculations. I know for a fact 
that the Padres \vill be bettcr next 
year. Ryan Klesko and Phil levin 
will be improved and could both go 
for 40-plus.homers next year. With 
the added bat of star prospect Scan 
Burroughs, San Diego is a few 
pitchers away from being a legiti-
mate contender. 

1 can say that whoever is luck"}' 
enough - or, more appropriately, 
rich enough - to land Barry Bonds 
and Jason Giambi will be much 
improved and could contend for a 
ring. One wild card in this mess 
will be the dissolvement of two 
teams, in which case their players 
would be drafted off to other 
teams, evening the playing field 
somewhat. Possible available play-
ers will be Vladamir Guerrero, 
Brad Radke, Joe Mays, Corey 
Koskie and Doug Mientkiewicz. 
Anyone of these players can add 
five wins to a bad team. 

So there you have it. I'm pretty 
confident in these predictions, but 
I don't take responsablility for any 
of you morons running to Las 
Vegas to place a few bets. In fact, 
you shouldn 't bet on the college 
sports anyway ... but that's another 
installment. For now, just suffice 
with my decree that you shouldn't 
do it. 

Because I said so.

Tritons stun crosstown rival SDSU 
UCSD women's basketball beats Aztecs 63-59 in first meeting since 1978

Fantastic freshman: Triton Margaret Johnson, who fi nished with 15 points, 
shoots a jumper over SDSU's ValenCIa Howard Friday night. 

By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Inside a practically empty Cox 
Arena at San Diego State 
University Friday night, the 
UCSD women 's basketball team 
began its season against the 
Division I Azte~s in the two 
teams ' first meeting since a 33-72 
Triton loss Nov. 28, 1978. 

However, this year's Tritons 
refused to let histOry repeat itself 
when they stunned SDSU 63-59. 
T he Aztecs had previously lost 
only one game to another San 
Diego universi ty. 

"[The players] thought I was 
nuts when 1 schedul ed this 
game," said Triton head coach 
Judy Malone. " But that's what 
happens when Division I schools 
play Division II schools: T hey 
tend to overlook them." 

Triton guard Ali Ginn sa id the 
team wasn 't nervous to be facing 
a Division I opponant. 

"We kind of didn't know what 
to expect [from SDSlJ]," she said. 
"We really weren 't intimidated." 

The Tritons didn't look intimi-
dated when they started off the 
game aggressively despite the expe-
rience advantage of SDSU, which 
already had two games wlder its 
belt this season and was pla0ng 
with four returning stlrters. 

SDSU began the game with a 
detlnite game plan, going inside 
and trying to take advantage of its 
6-4 center Morgan Vargas and 
tWO 6-0 starting forwatds. 

However, the scrappy Triton 
defense, led by point guard Maya 

Fok and forward Danyiel 
Wortham, effectively contained 
the SDSU offense inside the key 
and created 14 first-half 
turnovers for SDSU with its 
energetic, hard-nosed play. 

The two teams went back and 
forth for most of the fi rst half, 
\vith the Tritons taking ~I 14-1 2 
lead with 12 :30 left in the half. 
UCSD then fell behind after an 
SDSU three-pointer ga ve the 
Aztecs a 17-16 advantage, wh ich 
they would later ax tend to a 26-
20 lead with less than three min-
utes left in the half. 

Th e T ritons ba ttl ed back. 
helped by a G inn three-pointer 
and a bucket at the end of the fi rst 
half by freshman center ,\\arg'lrct 
J o hnson - who tl nished her 
UCSD debut wi th 15 pOintS and 
7 re bo unds - and UCS D fi n-
ished the half down 26-29. 

Despite hi ttJllg o illy 25 per-
cent of fi rst-half free- throw 
attempts and turning the ba ll 
over 18 times, ,\blo ne was satis-
fi ed wi th her team 's perfonmll1ce. 

"I tho ught if we kept it close, 
we 'd be OK," she sa id. 

SDSU head coach Barb nmh 
hatl a different outlook on hcr 
team 's first half. 

"Our starte rs tl itln't come 
ready to play; I th ink we took 
this team for granted," she ~aid . 
"The starter In the tirst ha lf 
didn 't d o what they were ,up-
posed to do." 

SDS U started the second half 
with a revamped lineup, but was

Men's basketball falls to USD 
Tritons are no match for Division I University of San Diego, lose 62-89 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team suffered its first loss of the 
season, falling to Division I cross-
town rival University of San Diego 
Tuesday night at the Toreros' 
J enny Craig Pavilion. 

Kyle Moyneur led the Tritons 
with 16 points-shooting 67 per-
cent from the field - and four 

rebounds , and freshman Hassan 
Bassiri picked up eight points and 
four assists. Bassari picked up sig-
nificant pla0ng rime in place of 
regular point guard Cameron 
Jackson, who did not play. 

Visiting UCSD put up a valiant 
effort, but in the end, was ~mpfy 
outsized and ounnuscled by the 
USD lbreros. The Tritons were 
within four points with eight min-
utes to go in the first half, but a 

20-4 run put USD out of range. 
During that dreadful eight-

minute stretch of the first half, 
UCSD went 1-8 from the field 
and did not pick up a rebound, 
while the Toreros went 8-13 and 
grabbed II boards. 

The Tritons struggled inside, 
finishing the game with 28 
rebounds compared to USD's 48. 
Torero center Kevin Hanson 
dominated the key all night, pick-

ing up game-highs in rebounds 
with I I as well as blocks with 
three. Andre Laws led USD with 
26 points and four assists . 

The Torcros' zone defense sti-
fled UCSD's offense, forcing the 
Tritons to keep the ball on thc 
perimeter most of the game. Of 
UCSD's 52 shots, 30 of them were 
from beyond the three-point line. 

The Tritons next play SDSU on 
Tuesday night at Cox Arena at 7 p.m. 

UCSD eyes Sears Directors' Cup 
Men's cross country places UCSD 28th in standings .with 41 points 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Standing near the conclusion 
of the fall sporting season, UCSD 
- after sending the women's soc-
cer, women's volleyball, men's 
cross country and men's water 
polo teams to postseason play -
finds itself among the leaders in 
the Sears Directors' Cup stand-
ings. 

The Sears Directors' Cup 
competition honors the top athlet-
ic programs in each National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
diVision, as well as in the National 

Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics. 

For Division II schools, 14 
team sports (seven men and 
seven women) determine the 
number of points each school 
can earn. T he number of poi nts 
each team receives for its school 
is based on how well it places 
during the season and postsea-
son. The school with the most 
points overall receives the 
Waterford crystal trophy from 
Sears. 

Last year, UC Davis, which 
has fil1lshed either first or second 
in every Sears Directors' Cup 

competition si nce the program's 
in itiation in 1996, won t he 
Waterford trophy for the fourth 
time despite not winning any 
national championships that 
yea r. 

UCSD, competing last year 
for the first time in the Division 
II Sears Directors' Cup tace, fin-
ished an impressive fourth over-
all . 

T his year, UCSD currently has 
41 points and is ranked 28th in the 
nation out of over 200 Division II 
schools. Not bad in itself, but 
these facts are more impressive 
when also considering the fact 

that those standing are based only 
on the men's cross country, 
women's cross country and fie ld 
hockey teams and have yet to take 
into account the points for the 
Ttitons' volleyball -and soccer 
teams, which are still competing 
and promise to give the Tritons 
major poin ts. 

Al l of the Tritons' 41 points 
have come from cheir men's cross 
country team, which competed in 
the NCAA Division II nationals 
and placed 15th overall.
