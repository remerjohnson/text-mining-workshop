Mural-Maker Speaks Again 
A study in perennial creation 

myths. A head, a wing, a child. 
Light, shadow, organic; changing 
forms. 

The creator of the Revelle 
Cafeteria's famous mural ar-
rived on campus yesterday to 
explain again what exactly he was 
llttempting in his year long effort 
to fill up the space "put there 
by Robert Anderson," the cafe-
teria's architect. 

The figure in the middle of 
the mural stands for childhood, 
"but is not necessarily a child," 
he said. "I wanted childhood 
in the painting," and a French 
movie might have given him the 
idea for a keyhole peek at a 
child becoming a human being. 

Interested in the world of 
transition, Warshaw said that 
only earthy colors could give a 
mural a "Mannerist" sensation; 
mannerism was a style of painting 
during the 17th century. He also 
admits to a strong interest in 
Spanish painting. "The Prado 
(in Madrid) is my favorite mu-
seum." 

On Tuesday night Dr. Schultz 
of the Physics department pre-
sented what he feels is the op-
timum solution to the cafeteria 
problem. He has been doing re-
search on the matter since the 
recent "walk-ins" staged bydis -
senting commuters. He sounded 
out his proposal by presenting it 
to a joint meeting of the inter hall 
councils and RAs from Revelle 
and Muir Colleges. 

Schultz felt that the present 
system has several built-in pit-
falls, or, as he termed it, "grey 
areas." One of these is the con-
cept that meal cards are non-
transferable. He felt that this 
was "psychologically difficult." 

Students feel that they are en-
titled to 20 complete meals a 
week, and if they miss any or 
aren't hungry, they feel that they 
should compensate for it by taking 
out food or feeding non-resident 
friends. 

Schultz stated that a general 
attitude of antagonism towards 
the Prophet Co. has evolved. 
Because of the general lack of 
food quality, students rationalize 
any violations of their contract. 
Besides stealing food, they think 
that they will "get even" by 
using their privilege of unlimited 
seconds to the utmost. 

However, what students don't 
realize, said Schultz, is that they 
are putting nothing over on the 
Prophet Co. and will end up 
paying for it in the long run. 
Rates will only be raised next 

Professor Howard Warshaw 
described the methods he used in 
painting and planning the mural 
yesterday and last night in a 
series of meetings sponsored by 
the Guest-in-Residence Commit-
tee. In a new college at UC 
Santa Barbara, Warshaw teaches 
art to only ten students at a 
time, who "each have a key to 
the classroom so they can paint 
all day and night" if they so 
choose. 

Communications Board 
Deals With Indicator 

The mural, he explained, de-
picts the evolution of man "from 
the time heleft the Proconsul 
stage, about 30 million years ago, 
through the Australopithecus 
stage." He said that figures 
superimposed upon one another 
represent his interest in "meta-
morphosis." He has included 
allusions to Tintoretto' por-
trayal of St. Mark in the middle-
right section of the painting, 
where a figure of a camel can 
be seen. 

The Communications Board 
declared "The Indicator" bank-
rupt at its Jan. 26 meeting, and 
put it in receivership until its 
finances could be adjusted. 

The action was taken after 
comparative statistics of the fin-
ancial operations of the two cam-
pus newspapers were released 
for the First Quarter of the 
present academic year. 

"The Indicator'" ,showed an 
unexpected deficit of approx-
imately $785. Both newspapers 

Jim Miner Resigns AS Post 
Jim Miner, a Revelle sopho-

more, announced his resignation 
trom the AS Senate last week, and 
set ofl a constitutional time bomb 
unparalleled since the resigna-
tion ot two 'Senators last year. 

Elected as Lower Division Sen-
ator in the Spring, 1966 elections, 
Miner gave three reasons lor his 
action: grade s, work and anarchy. 
"Except for an exceptional stu-
dent," he said, "UCSD students 
do not have time for student go-
vernment--to runaround survey-
ing student opinion. Revelle Col-
lege keeps me busy getting work 
in on time." 

Miner said that student govern-

ment is not really needed. "I think 
students would provide their own 
entertainment without an official 
government." 

Commenting on the vacancy 
now present in the 8-member 
Senate, Miner said he did not 
care what was done, "I suppose 
the AS should appoint a Muir stu-
dent in my place," he said. 

The Constitution does not pro-
vide for filling vacancies in the 
Senate. According to one other 
Senator, the problem would prob-
ably be dealt with at the regular-
ly schedttled mee6nt 011 The8day. 

are appropriated eq al amounts 
from the AS Senate ($71 per 
issue) and the Vending Machine 
Committee ($62 per issue). The 
balance of operating and capital 
outlay expenses is made up 
through advertising. 

Under the chairmanship of Alan 
Blackstock, Manager Business 
Service, Revelle College, the Re-
ceivershop Sub-Committee of the 
Communications Board will man-
age "only the financial aspects" 
of "The Indicator" until its fiscal 
operations can be returned to a 
stable footing. According to 
Mr. Blackstock, the campus' 
newspaper will either have to 
mount a virgorous advertising 
sales campaign or " adjust the 
size of the publiclltions to fit 
the money available until 
additional revenues " can be 
generated. 

"The Indicator" brought in 
only $347.49 compared with a 
projected income of $600.00. 
Each newspaper sput subscrip-
tion revenue (about $300 in total) 
divided the income from the Na-
tional Advertising Agency. 

John McElhose, editor of the 
Indicator, told the Board that 
a 15% rebate can be expected 
from his publisher, the Encinitas 
"Coast Dispatch", so that the 
amount of the deficit would drop. 

year to compensate for this 
year's losses . Furthermore, 
there is a clause in this year's 
contract that enables Prophet to 
assess each student an extra 5%. 

It was revealed that Prophet 
takes into account both the missed 
meal factor and the unlimited 
seconds . They compute an aver-
age and merely adjust their 
prices to cover it. For instance, 
they consider that the average 
student misses 20% of his meals 
each week. 

Some other interesting statis-
tics were presented. Bussing of 
trays left outside the cafeteria 
costs Prophet $4,000.00 a year 
alone. stolen silverware amount-
ed to $6,000.00 last year. Schultz 
pointed out that a penny adayver 
student of waste or theft amounts 
to $2,420.00 loss for the year. 

Schultz also revealed that the 
Prophet Co. had served notice 
in January that they intended to 
pull out within 30 days. However, 
new rates, unquestionably higher, 
were negotiated. Therefore, it is 
obvious that the students will pay 
for the increased costs of opera-
tion. 

Schultz felt that the other main 
problem built into the current 
system was the complete lack of 
incentive on the part of the Pro-
phet Co. to provide quality food. 
He contended that any business -
man in their position would find 
themselves with no alternative 
but to provide the cheapest pos-
sible food. 

This lack of quality leads to 
further antagonism towards Pro-
phet and more stealing, which in 
·turn leads to further reductions 
in quality. In short, there has 

evolved a vicious circle. 
To escape this vicious circle 

Schultz proposed a plan that would 
involve the use of coupons. Resi-
dent students would purchase a 
book of coupons weekly. Since 
they constitute a large group of 
buyers, they would receive a 
certain discount, about 25~ over 
retail prices. Non-residents 
would purchase on a straight 
cash basis. 

This plan would enable Prophet 
to offer several different priced 
entrees each day, and would force 
them to provide good quality. Stu-
dents would have a voice in the 
choice of food through their pur-
chases. Prices would correspond 
exactly to retail prices and would 
also be regulated by student de-
mand. 

The coupons would be trans-
ferable and possibly redeemable 
at the end of the week. According 
to Schultz, the coupon plan would 
eliminate all the "grey areas" 
that now exist in the current 
system. 

If the coupon plan were put 
into effect several size books 
might be offered, for example 
$22, $25, and 28. Then, those 
who eat more would pay their 
fair share, while light eaters 
would pay less than they are now. 
In essence, Schultz's plan is de-
signed to enable the cafeteria to 
function as a free competitive 
open market. 

If enough interest is shown, 
Schultz will explain his plan in 
detail to the resident students 
as a body, and the proposal will 
go on the ballot to be held in the 
near future.

Registration Begins Early 
Registration for the Spring 

Quarter will commence next 
week, according to Dudley Wray, 
Acting Registrar. 

Like the pre-enrollment pro-
gram experimented with before 
the Fall Quarter, next quarter's 
enrollment will be by mail. Wray 
explained that the system will 
operate as a ticket agency for a 
movie theatre. "Students will 
reserve seats in classes on 'pre-
ferred program' cards and will 
be notified by mail whether their 
preferences have been accepted 
after they pay their Incidental 
Fees." 

A week from today, Feb. 16, 
class schedules should be avail-
able in the bookstore, Wray said. 
About Feb. 20, all students will 
receive enrollment packets for 
registration. On Friday, Feb. 23, 
Seniors will turn in th ir pre-
ferred schedule card, and in 
order of receipt, corresponding 
computer cards will be pulled 
for the classes. On Feb. 26 
Juniors will turn in their cards, 
and on Tuesday, the Sophomores, 
and Wednesday, the Freshmen. 

"students will have priority, 
first of all, according to their 
class," Wray said. "Within each 

class, priority w1l1 exist on a 
fir st-come, fir st-served basis." 

When fee s are paid by March 
8, students will receive their 
Study List Packets with the class 
cards which they asked for. 

"If a class is not available, 
Wray said, "students can drop 
and add classes on the 27th from 
3 to 5 p.m. at the Enrollment 
Cente r. If students want to trade 
cards with friends, this is also 
possible, as long as such changes 
are marked on the 111 Card, and 
the class cards are appropriately 
signed." 

For those students who inten-
tionally sign up for more than 
four classes, \\J ray said, the 
Registrar's Office will ask the 
students' Provos:s' offices to 
advise them on what clas es 
mu be dropped. 

"In order to make the y em 
work:' Wray w rned, " the stu-
dents must submit th ir pre-
ferred program, pay their fees 
to nsure getting th ir reserved 
seats, and fill out the study List 
Packet in time. If this system 
works, ud nt may be abl to 
reserve seats in clas s in May 
tor th FaU Quarter, so that they 
wUl not have to be back at UCSD 
until the day cIa ses begin."

AS N, gleet Met 
With . Disdain 

What is the AS Senate? Is It a machine that organizes activities for 
weekend entertainment? To the amazement of most Tritons, the Senate 
is made up of students who theoretically plan dances and Old Films 
Night and spend $36,000 any way they see fit. They are the constitutional 
representatives of the undergraduate student body. 

What we are disappointed with is that the eight senators and 2 
officers have failed to be responsive to the needs of the student body. 
For the most part nothing has been accomplished. Muir College 
pleads for funds to provide its students with college activities, and the 
AS adamantly says no. Revelle College desperately needs commut~r 
students to help organize a student government, and the AS does 011. 
Instead, the Senate has operated on a. plan-as-you-go basis, without 
following any set of requirements for funding AS fees. The only 
nebulous guideline has been something called "campus event," which 
supposedly is open to all students. In reality, any club or organization 
that knows a senator or officer, can approach the Senate and ask for 
money and get it. "Oh, yes, it's a campus event," they exclaim, and 
the Senate, almost by reflex votes the money. 

The Senator s are furthermore unknown to the majority of the student 
body. How many students can name even one of their representatives? 
The Senators have neglected to encourage new students to participate 
in the scores of clubs on campus. They have no time, they say. 
The AS Constitution needs revision in practically every area. No 
mention is made of tilling vacancies; representation by colleges 
is unproportional to population. The time of elections, during "the 
Winter Quarter", must be changed to meet the decision to run elections 
in the Spring. BY-laws, as well, must be written. 

Senate Should Help Campus Organizations 

But admitting our problems, as the Chancellor has often said, does 
not resolve them. Jim Miner's resignation does not aid the Senate; it 
merely hurts the Senate. Our representatives are elected to further 
the cause of student participation in extra-curriculum activities, 
whether they be assisting a Tijuana orphanage to welcoming foreign 
students on campus. Because they are elected to attend to the needs 
of the AS, the Senators are expected to represent students' wants. 
other activities in which the Senators are involved should come second 
to their duties as elected representatives. [f their academic schedules 
interfere with their effectiveness, they should not run for office. The 
Senators, in other words, have no business being representatives if 
they are not able to perform the duties of their office. 

We applaud the positive programs the AS Senate has so far begun, 
such as the Student Center and bi-weekly activities--Gary Curtis and 
Tom Shepard deserve credit for their efforts--but what of the other 
senators? Before they leave office on or about May I, we hope they 
will have begun to show that an Apathetic Senate can become an 
Activated and enthusiastic Senate. The AS can not wait forever for its 
Senate to decide to face the problems that threaten the continuance of 
a student government on campus. It is time the Senate opened its ears 
and listened to and acted upon the troubles everyone else is facing.

Editor, the Triton Times 

The La JollaBureauoflnvesti-
gation has claimed that Professor 
Richard H. Popkin, Chairman of 
the Department of Philosophyin 
the University of California at 
San Diego, was engaged in coer-
cive activities on the campus 
during Sunday-Monday 21-22 of 
January. 1968. However, there is 
sworn testimony (persistently 
discounted by the L.J .B.I.) that, 
at that very time, the true Pro-
fessor Popkin was aboard a 
space-ship from which he later 
disembarked in a puff of smoke 
(or, according to some inde-
pendant psychiatrists, out of an 
open manhole) on or near a gras-
sy knoll in the grounds of Cama-
rillo State Hospital. Further-
more, application of Donnelly 
cryptanalysis to the Warren Re-
port reveals that not only was it 
written by Francis Bacon but 
triple Popkin was in Dallas on 
21-22 January ,1968 (accompanied 
by a somewhat confused double 
of Mrs. Popkin Sr., who was 
afraid that she might h8. ve over-
encouraged him.) 

Can we, then, continue to cling 
to the hope that the damage to 
UCSD has been done by one lonely 
alienated nut, all by hImself; or 
has the time come to face reality 
and cry out that the Chairman of 
the Department of Literature, al-
so seems to have used peculiar 
criteria in selection of fac-
ulty?

insist that our government cannot 
demand loyalty and obedience 
from the Negro. Answers are 
proposed daily in Revelle Plaza 
by the SIL (" Long live the Demo-
cratic People's Republic of North 
Korea! ") And answers are now 
being proposed, courtesy of Sil 
in their "political education" 
(read "revolutionary indoctrin-
ation") seminar. 

But whe re is the voice of the 
right? In the classroom? On 
the plaza? Conservatism is con-
spicuous only by its absence. The 
right wing had better consider 
defending its position instead of 
silently consoling itself with the 
notion that "God is on our side." 
I've heard He helps those who 
help themselves. 

I have charged that the student 
is deprived of choice by the pre-
vailing situation, however, this 
may not be altogether true. As-
suredly, the student may choose 
to accept the ideas of Marcuse, 
KI kby, Shapiro, Cleaveland, et. 
al.; one may choose to fight for 
the right all by himseU--the odds 
in that case being extremely 
good in favor of the left; or one 
might opt out of the whole mess 
and become totally apathetic to 
political questlons--wbich Is ap-
parently the case with the ma-
jority of UCSD students. 

U all this is to be considered 
by conservatives as a happy state 

of affair s, then pe rhaps I shonld 
withdraw my charge. But ifthere 
is any kind of feeling that the 
right has been remiss in its obli-
gation to provide an alternative

Your suggestion to name the 

new library building at UCSD The 
John S. Gallbrath Library isout-
standing. And I might add, very 
timely. It was the Chance llor 
who conceived the idea of a great 
library at UCSD. He supported 
every private effort to help raise 
funds, endured the wrath otbudget 
planners and politico' s when 
pleading the case in Sacramento 
so it is only right that the new 
library should bear his name. 

Our Chapter has donated five 
hundred dollars ($500.00) to the 
library fund so far and it Is 
my sincere wish that we wUl 
contribute again and again. AU 
our members sincerely hope that 
our future contributions will be 
made to the John S. Gallbrath 
Library Fund. John R. Hogan

It becomes increasingly more

s tands sorely in need of a more 
balanced approach to political 
education. Under present condi-
tions, the student is almost tot-
ally deprived of a choice of views 
concerning what courses of action 
government should properly 
pursue. That inability to choose 
results primarily from his in-

Prof To Get Piece Of Moon 
The Interhall Councll was dealt 

a crushing biow Tuesday when its 
JUdicial Board proposal failed 
to receive the needed two-thirds 
majority by seven votes. With 
only 303 out of the nearly 850 
resident students voting, the final 
tally was 195 for and 108 against. 

Failure of the proposal was 
discussed ·and it was generally 
agreed that there had beena gen-
eral lack of information, both 
about the proposal and the elec-
tion. 

Bill Eastman, a resident stu-
dent voiced several objections to 
the proposal. Generally he called 
for" student power", which would 
involve complete student take-
over of all campus functions that 
directly concerned the students . 
He felt that the Judicial Board 
was a step in the right direction, 
but that "partial success was 
not an end." 

The Interhall Council pointed 
out that the proposal would give 
the responsibility that now lies 
with the R.A. to the students . 
The matter was tabled and the 
debate about student power be-
tween Eastman, Dean Hull, and 
several council members con-
tinued for Quite a while after 
the adjournment of the meeting. 

In other business the council 
heard a report from the com-
mittee that had presented the 
visitation proposal to COSA, a 
committee composed of elected 
student representatives and ap-
pointed faculty and administra-
tion members. According to Paul 
Pucci, debate on the matter raged 
for nearly an hour and a half. 
Matters discussed were privacy, 
ethics, and the University's pub-
lic image. The board finally de-
cided to leave the matter to 
Provost SaJtman. Without the 
board's recommendation chances 
look bleak for adoption of the 
measure, which would liberalize 
rules concerning in-room visi-
tation and curfew for lower di-
vision women. 

Dean Hull then told the council 
that the cafeteria situation was 
still being looked into. Dr. Schultz 
is stIlI working on an elaborate 
plan involving coupons, which he 
hopes to present to resident stu-
dents tor their vote, along with 
the three alternative proposals 
already made. 

Ann Conklin brought up the 
question of window decor. She 
said that several visitors on the 
campus had complained about 
what they had seen on the win-
dows ot Argo Hall. The question 
ot obscenity and "good taste" 
were discussed, but it was quite 
generally agreed that It was the 
students' right to express them-
se lves as long as they stayed 
within the limits ot the law, 
which is very vague. Clayton 
Anderson and several others 
were inter ested to know what 
specUically they had objected to. 
The council agreed to take no 
position on the matter. 

The council also discussed 
plans for a dance that they would · 
sponsor sometime next quarter. 
This dance would match students 
through the use of computers, 
and would be most appropriately 
entitled the "Computer Dance."

Hopefully, the new gym can be 
used for the event. 

Finally, the council reported 
that the Beagle Barbecue Pit was 
nearing completion. Patio furni-
ture has been assembled and all 
that remains to be done is to 
shellac It. Any resident students 
can reserve the pit for a night 
by seeing Ann Conklin. Prophet

who give them their meal ticket

The claw of a lunar surveyor 
flas scratched the surface of the 
moon - hopefully an Apollo space 
team will soon explore the lunar 
surface and bring back lunar 
samples. 

In seeking answer s, one does 
not have to wander far from the 
UCSD campus. James R. Arnold, 
Ph. D., Professor of Chemistry, 
currently lecturing Chemistry 2D 
and 20L will be one of the 
select tew to receive and do 
research on the lunar samples. 
In fact, he will be executive 
secretary of the UCSO group 
which also includes Dr. Harold 
Urey. Interviewed by the Triton 
Times, Dr. Arnold discussed the 
lunar samples and gave some 
Interesting insights into what 
specific scientifiC investigations 
he has conducted. 
According to Dr. Arnolrt, "the 
study of meteorites has been 
one of the more fascinating 
subjects oT interest" to him and 
many other scientists "espec-
ially during the past ten years." 

"Obtained through museums 
and their recent strikes against 
the earth," stated the chemistry 
professor, " meteorites prove 
excellent bodies for explOiting 
knowledge concerning the very 
earliest events of the universe." 

--~ Professor Arnold of UCSD's chemistry department. Staff Photo. 
Explaining further, Dr. Arnold 
remarked that, "meteorites pro-
vide superb material for carbon 
dating, and most important, the 
study of cosmic rays, and trans-
mutation effects which corres-
ponds to the forming of new nu-
clei." 

"Meteors are far better 
sources of study than natural 
earth isotopes ," he added,"beca-
use in outer space they are hit 
directly by cosmic radiation and 
with an extremely intense bomb-

ardment, whereas earth mater-
ials are shielded by the layers 
of earth's atmosphere" . 

Concerning the lunar samples, 
Dr, Arnold beleived they would 
provide even more extensive in-
formation for " measurement of 
transmutations and cosmic radi-
ation bombardment." This in-
formation will hopefully deter-
mine not only "how long the

Do you yearn for adventure? 

Do you feel the world is passing 
you by? The solution to your 
troubles may very well lie in the 
depths of the Matthews Campus 
bullding cleverly disguised under 
tbe name "Building 250", which 

lurks in sprawling friendliness 
across from the library.

Mlstl, in the midst of student Activities, always keeps her "cool". 

Topolovac 
With almost fifty clubs and ' 

organizations to worry about, the 
Student Activities Office is in a 
constant state of disruption. Not 
only is the office, at the north 
end ot Bldg. 250, M.C., a source 
for student information, but it Is 
also the origin for most of the 
planning that goes into making 
campus events successful. 

The major impetus that goes 
into these events comes from Bob 
Topolovac, Dean of Student Ac-
tivities. "My job," he explained, 
"is to provide advice and as-
sistance that clubs require in any 
way possible. This oliice serves 
as a link between the students 
and administration. We coordi-
nate various activities with col-
lege deans and encourage stu-

dents to participate in com-
munity-related projects." 

The other energy source in the 
office is Rita Roque, who is con-
stantly typing, telephoning and 
assisting students who wander up 
to her desk in search of the an-
swers. 

II This 1s pecuuar set-up to 
this campus," the dean began. ' 
"The functions of this oCfice are 
being shared with the college 
deans' oUices, so that DlOSt of 
the mechanics can be decen-
tralized." 

But with so many organiza-
tions on campus, too few stu-
dents participate. "It is very 
important for students to get 
involved at all levels of the Uni-
versity. They do not grow in 
only academics." 

Team Busy 
The reason, as with most 

things on campus, lies in the 
press of the curriculum. "Too 
few are willing to commit their 
free time," he sald. "I know 
there is a tremendous number 
of students who were leaders in 
high school, but who have 'burn-
ed out' upon coming to UCSD and 
are unwilling to make commit-
ments. Many students now active, 
on the other hand, were not ac-
tive leaders in high school." · 

Helping the students get in-
volved is another member of the 
Student Activities Office, but who 
prefers the designation 'Asso-
ciated Students Office' for her 
cramped corner of the office. 
Misti Wollington coordinates AS . 
activities with the eight ASSena-
tors and Rich Altenhoff and Herv 
Sweetwood (AS President and 
V.P.). 

The favorite recording secre-
tary for the myriad of committees 
and boards involved in student 
affairs, Misti makes it her job 
to be in the "!mow". Her desk 
is always a mass (mess) of bud-
gets and purchase orders , but 
she is nevertheless willing to 
stop everything and offer ad-
vice and sympathy for lost stu-
dents. 

All three, "Uncle" Bob, Rita, 
and Misti, in fact, are in 250 
for everyone's convenience. 
Their Job is to activate students 
to sell-entertainment. "Nothing 
is done by itself," Misti de-
clared. "We wouldn't be here if 
it weren't for the student In .

Leading the other offices in 
Bldg. 250, Dean Murphy is con-
stantly faced with decisions in-
volving conflicting opinions, He 
must decide what to do when a 
iarge crowd of students gathers 
to protest the Dow Chemical 
Company's presence on campus. 
He must answer to charges that 
"students have taken over the 
reins of UCSO". 

that these students take up these 
projects " when they have such 
difficult schedules at school". 

"While students at Berkeley 
(where Dean Murphy was Acting 
Dean of Men before coming to 
UCSD) are often fru strated with 
the system, UCSD students show 
a capacity for change--for com-
Ing up with new Ideas. There is 

an absence of distrust of people 
over 30 hopefully because there 
has not been any reason for 
distrust. 1 feel a sense of real 
community here." 

Dean Murphy is trying to make 
his olfice a place where problems 
can be aired informally and he Ip-
tully. "Many of the fUnction s of 
the typical Student Affairs Office 
will become localized in the col-
lege. The Student Union and the 
International Center (in the Clus-
ter complex) will be a proper 
place for carrying out discus-
sions on intercollegiate prob-
lems. And campus-wide facilities 
will assist staff members at the 
college level with such functions 
as tesUng, placement and finan-
cial aids." 

The one-hme law student hopes 
to carry out these goals as long 
as he can "stay honest and com-
petent, even until 1995." Judging 
from the following partial list of 
committees and boards which he 
serves on, Dean Murphy will be 
irreplaceable just because of his 
singular knowledge of UCSD 
bureaucracy: 

Auxilliary Enterprises Ad-
visory Committee, Student Con-
duct and Affairs Committee, 
Chancellor's Administrative 
Council, Committee on Illegal 
Use of Drugs, Advisory Com-

"Milk Wood" Portrays Welsh Life 

A single day in the life of a 
small Welsh town is expressed 
through tbe voices of its citizens 
in Dylan Thomas' "Under Milk 
Wood" which opened January 
25 at the Old lilobe Arena in 
Falstaff Tavern, Balboa Park. 

Producing director Craig Noel 
is staging the "play for voices" 
with perfor mances nightly except 
Monday through Februaryl!. 
"Under Milk Wood" will be pre-
sented arena style with audi-
ences seated on all tour sides 
of the action. 

Vivid scenes of the towns-
people, alternately gaudy, bawdy, 
macabre and tender, display the 
hopes and fears of the lives, 
lusts and loves of its pOliceman, 
postman and parson, ollts idlers, 
soaks, gossips , lonely shopkeep-
ers and teachers and its phi-
landerer s. 

Actresses Anne Archer, SheUa 
Byrne, Julia Brandley Frampton 
and Coralie Schatz will portray 
all the female roles in "Under 
Milk Wood" with Jack Aaronson, 
James Byrne, Duke Daybert and 
Jonathan Dunn-Rank1n cresting 
the male citizens of the imagi-
nary Welsh town. 

The Coffee Hut Committee involves Students' Affairs as much as any of the other committees on campus. 
the members are, from lett to right, Dean Bob Topolovac, Misti Wolfingloo, Trish Cunningham, 
George Kurata, Holly Holmes, Alan Blackstock, and Wayne Kight. 

As "Under Milk Wood" begins, 
the starless night turns into dawn, 
then the blazing reality of the 
sun Ught, followed by the softness 
of dusk and the secrecy of the 
evening. Four actors and lour 
actresses will create the sixty-
four citizens represented. 

Performances of "Under MUk 
Wood" will be Tuesdays, Wed-

1967 Oscars 
Previewed 

By Dave Sacherman 
As film critic of this splendid 

newspaper, 1 feel it my duty to 
make a few comments upon the 
films that have been released 
during 1967 which will receive 
their final judgments at the Aca-
demy Awards ceremony April 8. 

To qualify for the coveted Os-
car, a motion picture must have 
had a one-week engagement in a 
major city before last December 
31. Whether just or not, San 
Diego is not recognized as one 
of the cinema capitals of tile 
world, and, as a result, a good 
number of the top contenders 
for this year's awards have not 
appeared in this area as yet. 
However, within the next two 
months we will no doubt see the 
release of "Far From the Mad-
ding Crowd", Thomas Hardy's 
romantic novel brought to the 
screen with Julie C hrisUe, 
Terence Stamp, and Peter Finch. 
This is perhaps the most eagerly 
awaited event of the season, fol-
lowing the close of "Gone With 
the Wind" at the Center Theatre. 

The inevitabla question always 
asked by critics is: which film 
will be chosen Best of the Year? 
This year the question is ex-
tremely difficult to answer since 
there is a lack of one clearly 
outstanding entry, but rather 
many that are quitQ good. The 
best I can do at this point is list 
what I believe will considered by 
the Academy the top eight films 
of 1967, any 01 which should have 
a strong chance: 
1. "Camelot" - The enormously 
beautiful but highly disliked film 
which at least no critic can con-
test is the tine st mu sical in the 
last two year s. 
2. "Far From the Madding 
Crowd" - the visually splendid 
story of a love quadrangle in 
19th century England. 
3. "Taming of the Shrew" -
Burton and Taylor'sShakespear-
ean masterpiece that could give 
Miss Taylor a second Oscar in 
a row. 
4. "Bonnie and Clyde" - a sur-
prisingly fine film idealizing the 
legendary Barrow gang of the 
1930's. 
5. "The Graduate" - Mike Ni-
chol's second overwhelming suc-
cess (since "Virginia Woolf") 
and a very touching and humorous 
story. 
6. "Guess Who's Coming to Din-
ner?" - a very sentimental oc-
casion for Tracy-Hepburn lovers 
and a very moving drama on 
interracial marriage. 
7. "In the Heat of the Night" -
Sidney Poitier and Rod steiger 
give extremely powerful per-
formances in a seething hunt for 
a murderer in the South. 
8. "Ulysses" - James Joyce's 
brilliant nove 1 brought faithfully 
and beautifully to the screen.

Academy 
Music Goes Electronic 
The Music Department held two 

concerts last month; they were 
Interesting, to say the least. The 
Midnight C once rt, the first of the 
two, explored some of the many 
possibilities of connecting sounds 
with visual techniques. "J oy 
Journey" was the most success-
ful in attempting to achieve an 
esthetic relationship of these two 
dimensions , although the impact 
to the audIence was severely 
hampered by the waving of sever-
allighted cigarettes by competi-
tors. The electronic music In this 
number was coordinated by 
Pauline Oliveros, a member of 
the music staff who is a re-
cognized authority on electronic 
music. For a while in "Joy 
Journey" the electronic effects 
beared a close relationship with 
nineteenth century ensemble mu-
sic, a demonstration of one of 
the many capabilities of themed-
ium which is certain to play 
an even bigger part in tomorrow' s 
music. 

The most theatrical of the 
numbers was "The Dolls" a 
chaotic representation of the 
effects of today's technology on 
youth. Although at times I wonder 
if the creator, Lynn Lonidier, 
understood what she was doing 
("Happiness is cold chicken 
hearts" ?), she managed to get 
the message over quite spec-
tacularly, augmented by the dis-
tortion of a few modern tunes . 

I'm sure only the creator of 
"The Wolfman" understood the 
purpose of having a man growl 
into a microphone for twenty 
minutes to end the first concert. 

The second concert was much 
less sensational but much more 
sensible. William Mullen showed 
the diversity of the violin as well 
as his talents by playing Mozart 
and Tartini almost as well as 

Webern. The concert dragged in 
the middle with seve ral troubles 
in the projection and sound 
systems, but it did have its high 
points. The Mozart G Major 
Violin Concerto (first movement) 
was performed with a full 
symphony orchestra (on record 
of course). The timing of the 
violin with the record was fairly 
good, the opposite being the 
major potential drawback in a 
performance of this kind. The 
"Four Pieces for Violin and 
Piano" of Anton Webern was 
expertly played, although the aud-
ience didn't seem too pleased. 
The subtle dynamics of Webern's 
music produces a semsitivtty of 
timbre which is the keynote of 
his music. "His silence is 
hardly less expressive than 
sound," Machlis once wrote, and 
it was unfortunate that this 
s ilence couldn't be realized over 
the murmurs of the audience. 

After Webern the concert went 
downhill, with a minor comeback 
of "The Devj]'s Trill Sonata" 
of Tartini (a seventeenth-century 
composer), although part was 
diabolically ruined by a silly 
narration ot an encounter with 
the devil. 

Oliveros' "George Washington 
Slept Here" was a major dis-
appoi:ntment after her perform-
ance of electronic music two 
nights before. Everybody in-
cluding G. Washington was fast 
asleep by the end of the con-
cert, and it took the smashing 
of a violin to wake them up. 

No matter 

Mike Treinen and Alex Urqu-
hart hosted a party in their 
Pacific Beach apartment which 
was enjoyed by all present and 
even by those who had to enjoy 
it by phone. A party is a great 
way to blow money. Among the 
guests were Mike Foggiano, 
Chuck Henderson and Leslie 
Picht, Melodie Hills and Mike 
O'Rourke, Marg Van Valkenburg 
and Bob Nasset.

Cagers Lose To 

SIDELINE Davis; Occidental by David Stearns 
Look out Vince Lombardi! I think we might have found the old man's 

successor, at least as far as desire and tough attitude go. I'm referring 
to UCSD's Head Football Coach, Walt Hackett. Ask any of the men who 
were present at the orientation meeting a couple weeks ago, and they 
will tell you that this man knows what he is talking about, and he 
means business. 

Some 50 prospective players showed up for the intfoduction, and 
Hackett immediately set down his philosophy. Things will be done 
one way on his team, and that will be his way. No doubt this came as 
a shock to a lot of free thinkers, but it is the most convenient way to 
run a football team. Hackett made no bones about this point. he offered 
each man present a simple choice: His way or not at all. Hackett also 
stressed the traditional virtue that each man would be treated the 
same, whether he be "first-string or third". This often sounds 
phoney, but for some reason it is easy to believe this man when he 
says it. 

"Education is the reason you are here. Remember that." How many 
times have we heard that? In tact, how could anyone forget it? But 
again, you get the feeling that Hackett knows that everyone present 
wants to play football "on the side" and not as a way of life. Many 
times articles are run that tell of coaches expecting their players 
to eat , sleep, think, live football 36 hours a day. This may be the 
. .';.y if athletic ability is paying for your education, but try to get a 
chemistry prof. here to agree that you must have 2 extra day.s on 
your lab because you have to play football. Thus, Hackett insists 
on maximum effort in minimum time. Practices are tentatively 
scheduled in the late afternoon for no more than two hours. 

Hopefully, equipment will be complete by the opening of Spring 
training in April. Hackett told us that there would be no economizing 
on equipment. "When you use minimal safety measures, you increase 
injuries," Hackett said. And with his 15-odd years of coaching ex-
perience, he should know.

the "Hubarty Rights" winning a 
close 52-50 decision over "Grin 
and Bear It". P. Hansen had 40 
points for the winners, as D. Rice 
contributed 38 points to a losing 
cause. "Grin and Bear It" lost 
a second game, coming up on 
the short end of a 60- 34 score 
against Ogden Hall. In turn, Ogden 
was thrashed by the "But-Fakes" 
51-33. 

Football Coach Walt Hackett 

Wood court action in the last 
two weeks has seen the Tritons 
win two and drop three. At the 
UC Riverside Classic tournament 
the Tritons displayed their best 
play of the season, first dropping 
a heartbreaker to UC Davis 76 - 78 
in the last minutes. UCSO led by 
two at the half, 37-35, only to have 
Davis win by that margin. The 
same Davis team defeated UCSD 
by 39 at Christmas . 

In the contest, Bill Flatley e-
merged with high-point honors at 
29. in the Consolation champion-
ship the next night, UCSO was 
pitted against California Baptist 
in what developed into a rout for 
the Tritons . Score at the half had 
UCSD leading by 9, and that was 
soon stretched to 16; the final 
being 81-65. Steve Edney racked 
up 19 points for high-point man, 
and Flatley' s 13 and superb play 
also earned him a berth on the all 
tourney team. 

Three days later Occidental 
hosted the Tritons . Despite a con-
ceried effort by our locals,led by 
Thomas' 22-point ectort, Occi-
dental developed a lead midway 

Scheduling is being completed. Concerning this, Hackett dropped M •• ,s Grocer" es 
a shocker to those present. UCSD is going to start with an upgraded 
schedule the fir st year, skipping the usual 2-3 years of J.e . - Junior Pr.~.ce 
Varsity games that many teams go through. This tall, UCSD will II 
play full Varsity competition against such schools as Cal Western 
(7-3 for 1967), Cal Lutheran, Biola, Loyola of L.A., Nevada Southern BEER & WINE 
(in Las Vegas), possibly St. Mary's, and one or two others. Opea Dally • - 7 

It does appear that Hackett and his staff are preparing themselves S~ •• 1 " •• ::Ie 
f?r the first season. Rich Johnson, backfield coach, and Chuck Millenbah, 
line coach, are assisting Hackett in securing equipment and setting . ~;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;~22~S~'~A~"~.II~I~"~.~"~.~I.~'~I .~'1;.;;;~

PICK A PO ITION ... 
Pick a rela~ed po ition! Fencing 

Dick Cheney and B1I1 Rhead 
were the UCSD Triton's repre-
sentative at the first all-Cal 
fencing tournament at SantaBar-
bara last weekend. All eight of 
the UC campuses participated, 
with the entrants totaling fifty 

Entered in both epee' andfoUs, 
Cheney and Rhead foundthemsel-
ves up against stUf competition. 
Rhead advanced through the first 
round, but his fellow Triton could 
not do as well. Touche'!! 

Fencing is based on a point 
system, with points awarded for 
each valid touch of the opponent. 
Actually, a "touch" means one 
point against the man hit, and live 
such points constitute a match. 

Cheney later said that with the 
kind of competition found at the 
AU-Cal meet , all the schools 
should improve. He and Rhead felt 
it was tremendously helpful for 
studying form and attack. "UCR, 
Berkeley and UC LA all have ex-
cellent teams," Dick remarked, 
"they also send some men to the 
national meets." In reply to a 
query about local comfjetition, 
cheney stated that "San Diego 
state has or had a team. I went 
to a meet there last year, but 
haven't heard much lately. There 
are some clubs in San Diego, and 
a number of schools in Southern 
Callfornla have teams."

Cal State at Long Beach last 

week hosted the fifth annual 
MAUE Cup Regatta at Alomiros 
Bay. Eleven colleges were repre-
sented by over 90 sailors. 

Against tough competition, the 
Tritons were hampered by in-
sufficient numbers , forcing our 
boatmen to spread ' themselves 
thinly. Steve Slasor, our only 
" A" sklppe r , topped off a fine 
day of sailing with a !1rst place 
in his final race. Becky Cham-
berlin put out a great effort, 
competing in 11 out of 13 crew 
races. Bob Shutte and Ken Star 
sailed the "B" races, helping 
the Tritons to place seventh over-
all. 

U.S.C. won the event, with host 
Cal State at Long Beach and san 
Diego State taking second and 
thlrd respectively.

Miss Rudenko, a native of the 
Ukraine where she first won tame 
at the Kiev Opera, made her 
United States debut in Lincoln 
Center's Philharmonic Hall in 
January (21st). She was acclaim-
ed by critics in the New York 
papers as ". • •• a real artist, 
intelligent and stylish," "a rare 
coloratura recitalist," " •.. her 
recital was a triumph ... " 

Her program at State will in-
clude the Mad Scene from Doni-
zetti's "Luciadi Lammermoor"; 
"Der Holle Rache" from Mo-
zart's "Magic Flute"; the Al-

white is the Oriental color of 
mourning. They constitute the 
main body of the processional 
and will walk in single file. Per-
sons wishing to participate in the 
services are requested to walk 
silently, in single file behind 
these shrouded mourners.

feel a need to express their 
sorrow together. It was con-
ceived by and is under the sole 
sponsorship of Paul Brach, Pam-
ela Bugen, Judy Englehard and
