Kennedy on Call1PUS in Noventber 
For National Health Policy Talk 

Senator Edward Kennedy will make ,a brief 
appearance at UCSD next month to speak on national 
health policy, the Career Planning and Placement 
Office said yes~ay. 

The Massachusetts senator will discuss 
"perspectivel in American health care" Nov. 30, 

• according to Rona Subtonik, health sciences advisor 
for Career Planning and Placement. 

Subtonik insisted there are "no politics involved" in 
the possible presidential contender's visit, and said he 
was asked in July to speak here as a national figure 
involved with heaith care .. 

~y will speak f~r a~ut an hour during his 
rnorrung appearance, which will be open to the entire 
UCSD community, according to Subtonik. National 
health insurance, which Kennedy has tried to push 
through Congress, wiD probably be the focus of his 
talk, Ihe added. 

Kennedy will speak at 10:30 am, and will leave 
afterwards for a luncheon in Los Angeles, according to 
Subtonik. No location for the speech has been selected 
yet, and most other details "have not been worked 
out." 

The aenator's appearance jointly sponsored by the 
Health Sciences Advisory Program, an arm of Career 
Planning and Placement, and the Health Experience 
Learning Program, a ltudent·run organization on 
campus. 

Kennedy was invited to speak on behalf of the 
groups last July, and notified them Wednesday of his 
acceptance, Subtonik said. 

His invitation was made "before any of the political 
illUeS became involved," Subtonik commented. But 
"since the time of the invitationa, things have changed 
poIiticaUy," Ihe admitted. 

F'1I'It Lady Rosalyn Carter and fanner HEW 
Secrelary Joeeph Califano were also invited to speak 
here Ihi. year, but declined, Subtonik said. 

Kennedy baa indicated in the put he wi. announce 
his decision whether he wjII eeek the PJesidential 
nomination by Thanktgivinc, three day. before his 
~heduled appearance heN. But Sue Cobb, Ulistant 
IeCl'etary for Kennedy, yesterday would not confirm 
thit, ")'ina he ccdoesn't have a timetable" for his 
announcement. 

Kennedy'. UCSD visit will be part of an extended 
trip in the alate. While no 6naI plana have been m.de 
fOl the remainder of hi. California trip, Kennedy wiI 
probably be in the state "for over a da)'~ " Cobb said.

Proposed Theatre 
Site Readied For 
Noise Level Check 

Results Should Calm 
Officials' Complaint. 

By Cindy Beveridie 
Staff Writer 

Plans for the construction of an amphitheatre at 
UCSD will begin this quarter with a $5000 .ound 
check designed to answer questions about noiae 
interference with Central Library. The proposal for the 
check will be sent early next month to ChanceUor 
McfJroy for endorsement. 

AI~ough McfJroy has given no official approval, 
commIttee co-chairman Carlos Montalvo says the 
committee has received "positive encouragement" 
from McElroy. 

"If he supports our proposal, the money will come 
out of the Chancellor's discretionary fund. U for some 
reason he doesn't, we'l get it from another source" 

M aI " ' says ont vo. At any rate, the teat will be made." 
The sound check involves an extensive computer 

,analyais to determine noise distance and mqnitucle 
from the propoaed 5000·seat theatre. 'The results are 
expected to appease lOme of the doubts Central 
Library official. voiced over the aite for the 
amphitheatre. 

The preferred site i. located north of a aervice road 
behind the library, where a natlB'a1 canyon provide. 
what many call an ideal location for the project. The 
second site, which will also be tested, i. IOUth of that 
road. 

Initiated last year, the amphitheatre project will cost 
approximately $500,000 to build a place for major 
campus events. Concerts and plays may be held in the 
new theatre, according to Montalvo. 

Although the project will be under atudent 
jurisdiction and used for student purposes, community 
functions may be held there with Associated Students 
approval, he says. The first stage wiD be completed for 
use in a year and a half, according to Montalvo. 

The amphitheatre is expected to be funded through 
community donations and .upport of the Alumni and 
Development Department on campu.. Ray 
Ramseyer, spokelman for the department, says his 
office will help secure funda for the project once the site 
has been approved. 

Some of these channels include dealing with 
opposition from Central Unary. Official Alvina 
Robertson expresses "concern for the students and 
faculty who need to study when an event is going on." 

Diane Annala, co-chair of the committee, says the 
library may decide the site of the Amphitheatre. 

Montalvo, however, is confident that "with the 
present design and proper engineering, there won't be 
any background noise . The theatre will be built to 
direct sound away from the library." 

The sound check will be conducted this quarter by

Staple foods, luch as bread, 
sugar and flour, are Ulually

them. In the case of bread, all

Multiple· pricing often 

appears to be a terrific

Tips to Avoid the Traps and Save 

Special meat advertising 
may be misleading. When a

mean that all beef items are 
reduced. USlJaily only selected 
cull are lowered: sometimell 
there are no reductions in

The produce department

Here are some tip" 
supplied by CalPIRG. for 
budget-conac:ioUl shoppen 
to keep in mind: 

- Think of servings per

not cost per pound. 

-Pay in cas!-.. flaying by

more. 

- Compare sizes_ Bigger is 
not always cheaper. 

- Compare different forms 
of food. Seasonal patterns 
change the relative cosll of 
fresh, canned or frozen items. 

- Buy house brands when 
possible. Advertising 
increases the cost of famous 
name brand products. 

- Plan a week's menu, 
then make a shopping list and 
stick to it. 

- Shop specials, but 
remember that it costs about 
18 cents a mile to operate a 
car.

Nobel For Ely tis Sino Break Unlikely 

STOCKHOLM, Sweden - Greek poet Odysseus 
Ely tis, who seeks "true reality" through vivid works 
strongly rooted in the language, ~fe and age-old 
tradition of his native land, was awarded the 1979 
Nobel Prize for literature yesterday . 

The 68.year-old Ely tis, little known outside the 
Greek language , edged out a half-dozen 
internationally acclaimed writers who had been 
highly touted favorites for the prestigious honor. 

Reached by telephone in his small bachelor's flat in 
Athens, he told a rePQrler he was surprised and 
thankful "on my own behalf and my country's as a 
poet and a Greek ." 

Ely tis - a pen name for Odysseus Alepoudhelis • is 
the second Greek to win the Nobel for literature. 
Giorgos Serferis, a fellow poet in the surrealist-
influenced Greek school of the 1930s, was the 
laureate in 1963.

WASHINGTON . The Carter administration is 
confident there will be no interruption in U.s.-China 
relations, despite a judge's ruling that President 
Carter acted unconstitutionally in ending the mutual 
defense treaty with Taiwan, State Deparbnent 
sources said yesterday. 

The officials, asking that they not be identified, 
said they are still assessing the impact of the dec..ision 
Wednesday in which U.S. District Judge Oliver 
Gasch declared that the president needed the 
approval of two·thirds of the Senate or a majority 
vote by both houses to end the defense treaty. 

. The Peking government had made termination of 
the U.S·Taiwan treaty a precondition to normalizing 
relations with the United States. 

State Deparbnent v:ficials said the only firm 
decision the administration has made since the 
announcement of Gasch's decision has been to seek 
an expedited appeal before Jan. I, the termination 
date for the treaty.

Any Cyclist Has a Cha~ce 
Provost Won Grand Prix Last Year 

The winner in Saturday 
morning's Bicycle Grand Prix 
probably will not be the fastest 
cyclist around the five mile 
campus course. 

The winner will be the rider 
who finishes the race c10sests 
to his predicted finishing time, 
regardless 01 speed. Thus the 
casual cyclist has the same 
chance of winning as the 
experienced rider. 

Prizes will also be awarded 
to the fastest finisher of the 9 

am race, in both the men's and 
women's divisions, in the two 
divisions, in the two races . A 
five mile course will lead riders 
through Muir and Third 
Colleges, loop around Warren 
Campus, and return to the 
starting point (near the 
Recreation office) through 
Revelle College. The ten mile 
contest will round the five mile 
course twice. 

The race annually attracts 
around 30 entrants, a few of 

whom compete for the cycling 
team in the spring. As of 
yesterday. however, 25 
people have signed up for the 
free race, and the total may 
grow to about 50. 

The race isn't limited to 
students either. Last year, 
Warren Pro~olt Lee · Rudee 
won the contest. 

Signups for the race are at 
the Bike Coop in the student 
center and at the recreation 
office. 

Overtime Soccer Tie 'Lucky' 
By J. Rigby Slight 

The soccer team traveled

person. 

typical of Waliam Windom, 
who sounded as down to earth 
as the two famous writers he 
portrays in a series of one·man 
shows he's taken around the 
country for the last nine years . 

But, 01 course, Windom 
pointed out, "his stories tell 
more about him than anything 
else." 

Windom has given in roughly 
400 one·man performances. 
Most have been the original 
Thu,"e, which he now calls 
"'rhurber I." There have been 
about 45 performances of 
another version, using a 
second set of writings from the 
famed New Yorker columnist . 
Nearly all of the material in 
Thurber's books originally 
appeared in the New Yorker 
during his tenure there, which 
began in the mid· 1920s. 

about 50 shows a year, 
spending an average 01 two 
days on the road for each 
performance - Windom still 
does guest appearances on 
television and films. In fact. he 
began work on his latest film. 
currently titled "Vaientine," 
Tuesday. and will take time off 
lrom shooting to perform here 
Friday ni~ht and at UC 
Riverside on Saturday ni!:ht. 

Windom will bring the best 
known 01 those portrayals, 
Thu,lH?r, to UC~Q ~rid~y 
night at 8 pn in Mandeville 
Hall. 

His portrayal of the great 
American humorist philoso. 
pher besan with a . televilion 
show, "My World . .. And 
Welcome to It," in 1969. 
Alter the show was cancelled, 
Windom took James Thurber 
to the American people at 
large. in a touring one·man 
show that plays mostly 
colleges and small theaters. 

On the other hand. the 
veteran stage, movie and 
television aclor has researched 
Pyle 's life extensively, and had -
the opportunity to read several 
of the journalist's private 
lellers. Yet he said h~ does not 
present any more of Pyle's life 
than he does of lhurber's, 
choosing a!{ain to let the 
writer's stories speak for 
themselves. 

" Pyle I" was added in 
1976, lollowed the next year 
by " Pyle II ." 

""The television shots I do 
are really just advertising for 
"Thurber" and " Pyle ." Most 
people don't know who 
Thurber or Pyle are, but if tt.y 

"They had to ride on a bus 
lor 15 miles to get to the 
restaurant/theater. and they 
sang all the old ~hool songs 
on the way out there. lhelle 
were people my own age (over 
40), but by the time they got to 
the theater. they were 22 
allain," he chuckled. "They 
were the best audience I've 
ever played to." "Pyle's own life was pretty 

tragic," Windom said, "but his 
writings are all , present. I try 

All four shows remain in 
Windom's traveling reper· 
toire but can only be booked 
one at a time at any particular 
theater. 

recogmze my name from 
seeing me on their favorite 
show. they millht come to see 
me in person." 

As the interview (and the 
earthquake) neared an end, 
Windom said he was looking 
'orwn tD ............ 01 
the IItudent:; at U<'::'U. 

In 1976, he added another 
great American writer to his 
repertoire. World War 1/ 
journalist-humorist Ernie Pyle. 

In both portrayals, Windom' 

. to show each man as if he'd 
been interrupted at his 
work ... and let him tell his own 
stories." 

Why did Windom choose 
James Thurber rather than 

"I make a particular college 
or theater buy "'lhurber I" 
before I'll do "lllllrber II" or 
either 01 the Pyle shows - that 
way I can play to the same 

Windom said he no longer

Rarity: A Female Comic 
Levine Shows How It's Done 

By William GiblOll 
Comedian Emily Levme 

standa onstage preparing to do. 
her first bit, a combined 
impersonation of Tom Snyder 
and Olga Korbul. She is still, 
concentrating. Slowly, she 
crolles her left leg in front of 
her right, scraping the floor 
with her shoe. Bending her 
knee, she raises her foot , leans 
over gracefully and gently 
inaeru her foot into her mouth. 
The La Jolla Comedy Store 
audience guffaws as she 
bounces to the right of the 
stage, needling a spectator, 
aski!"f if he got it. This begins 
Emily s rapid-fire routine, a 
barrage of eclectic , socially. 
conscious jibes of Americana. 
Before she's through, she has 
us convinced that Anita 
Bryant is a terrorist, lawYf!fs 
are crooks, Catholics are . 
egoists, and that her M.D. 
father has opened the first 
coinoperated gynecology 
clinic. 

Her comed,. is a painful jab 
of truth, softened by a bright 
smile and a zany follow.up,

and delivered with an air of 
a1mo>!t desper:.ate com:ern. 

After the show, E.mily 
talked about her carer and her 
comedy. After working with 
theatre groups in New York 
City and doing some tdevision 
spots there, she came to Los 
Angeles on the advice of her 
manager. Presently she 's a 
writer for the series Taxi and 
The Associates . Emily 
considers stand-up comedy an 
outlet, "something where I can 
get up there and say what I 
really think." She mourns the 
disappearance of for 
individual talent, and admits 
that working for tdevision 
involves a lot of compromise. 
Still, she says, ' people in 
television have "a respect for 
intelligence." She has the 
altitude that if you say what 
you think, loudly and olten 
enough, people will listen to 
you. 

The shows Emily is working 
on seem to reflect these 
altitudes. Taxi is positively 
bright, and The Associates, a 
new series, has so far avoided 

the paralytic banality that 
afflicts most of today 's 
sitcoms. 

According to E.mily, 
breaking into the comedy 
business is not necessarily 
more difficldt for women than 

.for men. The hard part, she 
says, is breaking through the 
patterns and roles outlined for 
women in our societYi it's 
easier for men to maintain the 
aggressiveness necelisary for 
good stand-up, and to broach 
the ever.touchy, but rich, topic 
of sexuality. 

Other acts on the all·female 
bill met with varying success. 
Opener Gail Mathius did 
monologues, switching 
personas, mocking and toying 
with female stereotypes, from 
an innocent little girl talking 
about sex and drugs to a 
Pacific Heights street·waif. 

They were all funny, but 
Emily Levine's traditional 
stand·up style tOJ.lching on 
untraditional (and painful) 
subjects was the best 
argument of all for women's 
viability in the comedy 
businell.

'Headgames' is Below 
Foreigner's Potential 

By Beth Haas 
Hccrd ~(fmes . Forei!(ner 

(Atlantic) 
Foreigner's new a lbum 

Head ~(fmcs, a bland mixture 
01 ori!(inal songs. disclppoints 
many 01 their avid lollowers. 
Alter the le tdown of a 
canceled a ppea ra nce four 
weeks ago, San Diego fans 
were expecting a lot from this 
new release. 'lhe songs most 
of which are written by Mich 
Jones , ' ound a lmost exadly 
alike a nd Quickly hore the 
listener with their heavy meta l 
be<l!. 

Head /.!cr mcs. Foreigner's 
third album, is surprisingly 
unsuccessful by comparison 
with the ir second album, 
Dou"'c Vision , which sold 
double platinum. 'The title 
track ·from Head Rames, 
however, along with "Dirty 
White Boy" from the same 

album , arf' quickly climbing in 
the Top tto. 

The lirst side:: is wri tten 
comple::tely by' Jones. It gives 
the lis tener the impression that 
Jones must be su ffering from 
heartburn (as lrom it broken 
love affa ir. ) The lyrics, 
especia lly in " I'U Get Even 
With You" or in "Seventeen," 
portray women as callous 
heartbreakers or simplemind . 
ed sex objects. About one· 
third of the way throu!(h this 
repetitious no nse nse, th e 
listener begins to wonder just 
what this guy's problem is . 

The second side imlJroves 
grea tly, with less forgettable 
lyrics a nd some changes in the 
melodies. "The modern day" 
is by far the best song 01 the 
entire album. Written and 
sung by Jones, it has a snappy , 
crisp ' beat and casual, 
enjoyable lyrics charat:teristic 

01 the older Foreigner music . 
"Blinded By Science," sung by 
Lou Gramm : is a heavy tune 
with deep: lyrics · dealinl.! with 
the future and materialism 
run .rampart. This album hits 

bottom. thouJ.lh with the 
foolish " Rev on the Red Line," · 
written by Gramm and AI 
Greenwood. This song 
supposedly provides insight 
into the life of a grown up 

fru~tnlted drag·racer. 
Oon't wa~te any money on 

this generally llhallow dillc 
lhe few good songll are simply 
not worth the six or seven 
dollars you'd have to pay. 

Around Town 
The unfai~ngly brillant Art Ensemble of Chicago 

will be at the Backdoor, in the Aztec Center at 
SDSU, Oct. 22, with show. at 8 and 10:30 pm. The

consistently exciting "free" jazz units around. 
Musician Magazine hal said of them: "The Art 
Ensemble is the most influential, innovative and 
profound band of the Seventies. If you don't see them . 
at least once, you'll have a hard time explaining 
yourself to .your grandchildren." Admission is $4 for

I The Dnly Dna Here 
Pub Audience 

By Stephanie Davidson 
Some of us like to start the 

weekend early; such was the 
ca.e at Walk'. Place, 
Thunday Oct. 11. 

A New Wave band, The 
Only Ones, was achecIuIed to 

perform thai evening at 9:30. 
ana only two band members 
had arrived by that lime; the 
lead vocaliat/ guitarist and the 
drummer. The two of them 
tried to pacify a buzzed and 
impatient crowd with l! couple 

Guit.rilfPIetIr Sprque ac:cempanJjua ..... Ke~ Lettau 
in _ intimate concert October 20 at the Stratford 
Studie/n...1re in Del Mar. 

The Daily Guardian Friday, October 19. 1979 

Yawns at Ne\V Wave 
of the band's original 
cornJlOsitions. 

The applause in rellponse 
was merely polite. Most of the 
crowd had been at the pub 
long enough to have had "a 
few beers," it was crowded and 
many stood with their arms 
crossed and impatient looks on 
their faces, waiting to be 
entertained. Approximately 
20 minutes later, the 
remaining band members 
appeared. '!ltey had been 
temporarily lost in San Diello 
on their way trom the airport 

The band's late start didn't 
make much differ-ence 
anyway, because about half 
the audience cleared about 
when the bar clobed. 
Evidently, the majority carne 
to drink and weren't impressed 
by the Only Ones' musician· 
ship. Although the band did 
have a couple of faithful 
followers hang around that 
evening, one even had their 
albwn with him, which The 
Only Ones obligingly 
autographed, 

The band appeared 
professional, both in musical 
ability and Mage manner. The 
lead singer flaunted a vocal 
style heavily influenced by 
Bowie. He sang flatly, with a 
British accent. Without 
musical accompaniment, his 
voice was irritating to listen to. 
He also played lead and 
backup guitar at times. He 
was extremely pale and 
bone)" and his skin was almost 
translucent, giving him the 
appearance of a cadaver. Like 
Bowie, he too wore makeup to 

accentuate his eyes. 
The, relit of the band 

members looked as normal as 
musicians can. They are all 
from England except one 
Scoll. They have been 
together for about three years. 
Even though they get along 
well musically, they don't 
socialize with each other. Each 
goes hiS own way after the gig 
is over. '!ltursday night was 
their last night in town. 'Ihey 
planned to return the following 
day to England after a month 

tQur through the United States. 
Loud New Wave or Rock n' 

Roll bands don't seem to lend 
themselves wei! to Walk's 
Place. \Vh&never live, rowdy 
music is played there, people 
complain that their ears are 
ringing. 

Live music for a small space 
like Walks' should be softer, 
more mellow; it shouldn't 
carry such high-volume. On a 
weeknight especially, people 
want an early break from the 
school routine. 

Numb Your ' Neurons 
For Fun and Profit · 

By William Hamilton 
"Ine fundamental ~-;;derly­

ing purpose of human 
existence is not to comprehend 
love, appreciate pulchritude, 
or discover truth as, the great 
philosophers have argued, but 
rather to constantly strive for 
the achievement of altered 
states of consciousness and 
novel methods of adversely 
affecting motor coordination 
(i.e. getting wasted) via the 
ingestion, imbibement, and 
inhalation of near·lethal doses 
of intoxicants. 

Despite p'criodic admoni-
tion, the hwnan race has 
historically exhibited a 
pathological tendency to ferret 
out innovative chemical 
compounds for purposell of 
attaining a sybaritic nirvana. 

Although the objectives of 
inebriation are legion, running 
the gamut from facilitating 
cosmic awareness to 
seduction, motives have 
without exception been 
essentially escapist in nature. 

' The disenfranchised and 
alienated have often claimed 
to emp loy mind -altering 
substances in a token attempt 
to cope with adverse 
conditions beyond their 
capacity for amelioration. The 
more privileged hve used the 
same drugs for recreational 
purposes. Intellectuals and 
truth-seekerll claim that abuse 
enhances comprehension and 
perception of reality. All are 
pretentious excuses which 
serve only to rationalize man's 
self -destructive prodivitiell.

Crystallizing Your CraniuDl Can Be Fun. 
Conlinued from pcge 12 

'The cynical may ask of a 
drug " if it can't prevent cancer, 
reverse baldness , c ure 
hangovers, or prolong coitus, 
what good is · it?" Such 
criticism is fallacious, 
overlooking the intangible 

" faclors of pleasure derived 
from intemperate homhard-
ment of the mind with enough 
psychoactive drugs to produce 
a lobotomical-like ataractic 
state. After all, how many of 
your acquaintances normally 
behave as though they were 
horn congenitally retarded; let 
alone rely upon drugs to 
ca tapult them into a similar 
state. 

Alcohol IS the most 
universally popular legiti-
mately available drug today. It 
has enjoyed thousands of 
years of abuse, owing to its 
ease of concoction, pleasance 
of taste (unless imbihed 
unadulterated ), and peculiar 
tendency to make you forget 
who, where, and what you are. 
Ask any skid-row derelict, if he 
is not undergoing the delerium 
tremens , a nd he will hymn the 
virtues of the marvelous 
grape. Front him four-bits for 
another bOllle of musca tel, 
and he will sing you another 
one il he doesn't pass out first. 
Ask the forensic pathologist to 
show you a biopsy 01 his liver 
when he turns up on a slab the 
next week at the county 
coroner's office. Note the 
squiggly little triglyceride fally 
deposits and the manifesta· 

tions of advanced hear t 
disease. 

Another legal, socially 
acceptable drug is tobacco. 
Th ere are only three 
meritorious qualities to 
cigare ttes th ey are 
inexpensive, they don't kill you 
immediately, and they are a 
ni ce thing to have il you me 
a ddicted to them. Kissing a 
smoker is like orally -
copulating with a dirty sweat 
sock. 

Quaaludes are hypnotic, 
sopori fic drugs which produce 
physiological effects roughly 
equivalent to the way you feel 
20 minutes into your physics 
lecture. Valium , the most 
widely·dispensed psychiatric 
drug, is prescribed by doctors 
most often to get you out 01 
their hair, you neurotic , 
chronically-depressed jerk . 
Demerol , PerkQ<lan , and the ir 
a nalogous na rcotic relatives 
a re synthetic deriva tives of 
morphine, in turn a relative 01 
opium. If you lise these, you 
prollably hang around a 
different crowd and would not 
Ik reading this article unless 
you thou ght it would apprise 
you as to where you could 
score some. Barbi turates, or 
d owners, are used by 
individuals who wonder what it 
is like to he in a coma, and 
wish to approximate the 
experience chemically. 

PCP is a tranquilizer used to 
exacerbate the effects of bad 
mariJuana, subdue Sumo 
wrestlers, and l"heaply 

suhstitute for a plethora of 
com mer cia lly u""lvailable 
sought. after • drugs like THe. 
Unpleasant side effects include 
cleath. Notice the "shrubbery" 
recently planted adjacent to 
111ird College. This is actually 
not vegetation, but rather 
lormer PCP enthusiasts . 

'[he hallucinogenic drugs,

Recreational Drugs: You Love

Sniffing airplane glue and 
commercial solvents is an

Cocaine is a recent entry 
into the elitist category of 
prestige drugs, not so much 

due to the outrageous and 
indefensibl~ expense, but 
rather to the popular 
misconception that it makes 
women horny , When a friend 
turns you on to cocaine for the 
first time, he will probably 
make a big fuss over the 
meticulous and unduly 
prolonged ritual of chopping 
and forming it, and will preface 

• your inhalation of it by saying 
"You might not get oll .• ,it's a 
subtle high," which translated , 
means, "I've got bunk coke." 
Purchasing cocaine in minute 
amounts for personal use

Purchasing coke in lar!-(er

hazardous, as you face the 
potential dangers of being
