5,OOO-Seat Amphitheatre Planned Here 
By John Hondros 

A sociate New Editor 
Draft plans for an open-a ir 

a mphitheatre on campus 
capable of seating 5000 people, 
more than twice the capacity of 
any current campus facility, 
were developed this week at the 
Office of Budget and Space 
Management. 

The plans were transmitted 
to the Amphitheatre Planning 
Committee yesterday which is 
aiming to come up with the final 
plans for the amphitheatre by 
the end of spring quarter. 

According to the committee's 
co-coordinator Gary Moser, 

there is pre ently no place on 
campus to hold la rge ocial , 
political and cultura l event . 
Mo er b lieve a n a mphi-
theatre will open th niver ity 
to many event which in th 
past were shut out from CSD 
because of lack of adequate 
facilities . 

The "grassy slope bowl" will 
be located iust north of the 
Central Library , said Moser. 
The committee favored this site 
because of its " natura l bowl 
shape," he said . . 

According to Moser, the site 
provides easy pedes trian 
access from all parts of the 

campus. Becau the events 
will be held in the evenings and 
weekend . no a ddition al 
campus parking will be 
required, he said. 

The project cost has not been 
determined a of yet, said 
Moser . Funding for the 
amphitheatre will come from 
community contributions and 
institutional grants. 

However, the university will 
not be able to begin raising 
funds for the amphitheatre 
until funding for the new 500-
seat theatre, located south of 
the Humanities Library 
building , is c onfirmed , 

remarked Mo er. He said the 
Chancellor wants the ni -
ve rsity to be involved in only 
one fund raising effort a t a 
time, and " the other th tre 
has first priority." 

The amphithealre is planned 
in three phase to a llow 

menitie to the basic plan as 
funds become available, 
according to the Draft Project 
Planning Guide. 

In Phase I, site conformation 
will be completed as first 
priority. An access road to the 
site, as well as fencing , will be 
needed to control traffic and 
facilitate the charging of 

admi ion fees . 
Existi ng campus lavatory 

facilities or portable facilitie 
will serve the audience during 
Phase I. Power and water to the 
amphitheatre site, plus a stage, 
will complete the work planned 
for this phase. 

Phase II plans include 2000 . 
permanent outdoor-type 
seating, the addition of a shell 
behind the existing stage, 
installed stage lighting and 
storage facilities. 

Phase III will complete the 
amphitheatre with a small 
snack,bar facility, a projection

Pro-Marijuana, 
Anti-Apartheid 
Measures Get 
Berkeley OK 

By Trapper Byne 
Special to the Guardian 

BERKELEY - Berkeley' 
voters yesterday approved two 
city referendums which will 
mandate the withdrawel of city 
money from banks doing 
business with South Africa, and 
another which will all but 
legalize the possession and use 
of marijuana. 

With 59 of the city's 118 
precincts reporting, Measures 
" A" and "B," the South African 
initiatives, and Measure "C," 
the marijuana referendum, 
were leading by 2-1 margins. 
The measures attracted 
attention nationwide, but were 
almost ignored in Berkeley, 
where about 43 percent of the 
city's registered voters turned 
out in clear, windy weather. 

Stephen moom, Treasurer of 
the Citizens for the Berkeley 
Marijuana Initiative, said last 
night Measure "c" passed 
because " in Berkeley, voting 
for marijuana is like voting for 
mom and apple pie. " 

llloonl said he was not sure 
if the initiative would survive 
the test it will almost certainly 
face in the state courts. The 
city did not appeal a court 
decision overturning a similar 
initiative in 1973 after then-
Governor Ronald Reagan said 
he would call out state 
marshalls to enforce mar-
ijuana laws. 

" What it will do," moom 
said, " is set a limit on how far 
these kinds of initiatives can go. 
That's what Measure 'C' was 
designed to do in the first place. 

llloom added that the 
National Organization for the 
Repeal of Marijuana Laws will 
probably try to put an initiative 
on the November, 1980 
statewide ballot callilli for the 
legalization of marijuana. 

Ilerkeley police have been 
lax about enforcing marijuana 
laws since the 1973 initiative 
won the overwhelming support 
of the city's voters. Police 
officials say they can not 
remember the last time a 
person was arrested solely for 
the possession or use of

Like It Or Not 

M.cElroy Insists on 
New Vending Plan 

Chancellor McElroy's decision last week to give $30,000 of the 
vending machine revenues to the college governments will be 
enacted whether the college governments and the AS like it or 
not, Larry Barrett, Director of Auxiliary Services said 
yesterday. 

Barrett, under whose jurisdiction the vending machines fall , 
said McElroy's plan drastically increases the student share of 
the profit, but says McElroy's switch from an earlier proposal 
that would have given the colleges about $18,000 less was not 
caused by the boycott. 

"I don' t think people in the administration really paid 
attention to the boycott, " Barrett stated, adding that it " did not 
hurt the chancellor directly ... either personally or financially ." 

Barrett also said that McElroy's decision was the third he'd 
seen on how to allocate vending revenues, and that he wouldn 't 
move until after the income figures for tHe year were in, and 
until he could tell "if there's a fourth letter (co:ning)." 

The Registra.tion Fee Committee, which handles the budgets 
for the Deans, who will be getUnl most (Jf the vening machine 
money , will also wait to see whether McElroy's letter is the 
final word, committee chair Kenzie Nicoll said. 

MacblaeV .......... 
Ten machines were clamaleel durtnc the first week of the 

boycott, as oDDOaed to the usual one or two a week, Barrett said.

Campaign ,Taken 
To Dorms, Apt's 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Assoclale MaaaliDI Editor 

The AS election campaign, 
heretofore hardly noticeable, is 
being waled in the do~tories 
and apartments on campus. 

A combination of circum-
stances, including fundraising 
difficulties , typesetter 
availability. the number of 
candidates and , one presi-
dential hopeful says, the 
"overconfidence " of the 
frontrunners, are blamed by 
the candidates for the low 
public profile of the elections. 

Jon Bekken, Common Sense 
Student Welfare Commissioner 
candidate, says his slate has 
run into funding problems. 
"We've spent $23 so far, and 
have $7 more left to spend for 
five people. " 

Because of the financial 
constraints on the Common 
Sense campaign, Bekken says 
his group is limited to 
producing two leaflets for the 
campaign, one of which is 
already out. 

In place of c·ampaigning, his 
group is "hitting the dorms," 
i.e., dividing up the campus 
among the members of the 
slate and having each talk to 
students in the dorms. 

Carlos Montalvo and the 
Question Authority candidates· 
and the "Serving Students ... W e 
Deliver" slates are using a 
s imilar strategy. They have 

. developed a campaign master 
board , and have different 
members of their slates try and 
talk to students in different 
parts of the campus each night. 

Linda Sabo, the academic 
affairs candidate on the slate, 
attributes low ca mpaign 
visibility to the low number of 
candidates by comparison with 
last year, and to restrictions 
placed on typesetting, thus 
making campaign literature 
harder to produce. 

(David Hartwell , com -
missioner of communications, 
still has not allowed candidates 
to use the typesetting machine 
themselves: the Print Co-op, 
which manaeer MUte Keeler 
says has a backlog of 

orders, is trying to cope with 
election propaganda for aJJnOIt 
all the candidates.) 

One other Question Authority 
slate member attributes the 
low .,lection visibility to two · 
other factors : "part of the 
reason we have been putting up 
few banners is that they get 
ripped down two hours after we 
put them up." Also, the sialic 
member says the electioDS 
If8ve not been publicized. "Last 
year, they really prepped up 
the campaign ... there were 
advance stories in all tbe 
newspapers, and the people 
running the election had 
everything planned in ad-
vance." 

Jeremy Charlton, the Silly 
Student candidate for presi-
dent, says the low visibility of 
the election is caused not by 
conditions at UCSD but by tbe 
candidates. "(Montalvo) 
thinks he's won already, and 
isn 't campaigning very hard 
because of it. " 

Less seriously, Charlton says 
the Silly Students haven't had a 
visible campaign effort 
because " no one told us the_ 
elections were next week. " 
Silly Student pamphlets should 
be out later this week, he added.

against Jon Bekken by the

Any student who teus you that Bob Edelman should get 
tenure probably doesn't know what he or she is talking 
about. 

Getting tenure is a highly secretive, almost 
claustropbobic process. In Edelman's case, we don't know 
bow well biJ manuscript was written, what instructions the 
• ix profellOfI from other .universities were given in 

levaluatinl bt. work or what weight teaching ability is gi ven 
tiD the IMlection of permanent 'additions to the faculty. 

We also don't know whether Edelman, a social historian, 
; fit into the bistory department's general bias towards 
intellectual bJatory, and we don't know what criteria people 

?ia the blatory department used in evaluating Edelman's · 
work whicb comes from a field foreign to their own. Finally, 
we don't know how departmental politics affected 
Edelman'. tenure evaluation.

The only avenue for students that appears to be 

tanbarrlcaded right nOw is to get and know the tenure 
layatem and profellOrs on this campus, and work within the 
department. to lobby for professors wbo fulfill tbe 
requirements for -teacbing that are most important to 
adenta. . . 

At the same time, we should continue W publicly register 
,our diuatilfaction with how tenure is granted, and lobby for 
a cbance in the system. 

Drop Deadline 
The Academic Senate's Committee on Educational 

Policy is pruently considering moving the drop deadline 
fna cae sixth week to the fourth week. 

We oppose su'ch a move. 
A prime aim of any university education is to give the 

student tbe chance to intellectually explore and expand. As 
part of that learning. ltudenta will often take classes in 
wbich they have-little-expertise, classes in wl)ich guessing 
what kind of grade they might get is problematic until the 
fifth or sixth week. 

With the incredible pressure on students in all fields to 
maintain high grade averages, making studen~s decide 
what classes they want before they have an idea of what 
grade they ctm achieve is not consistent with providing a 
humanized leaming environment. 

We concede that the move would save paperwork. But 
,cutting through paperwork has never been a strong point of 
the University of California; and in the case of the drop 
deadline, that paperword serves as important insdlation for 
students othewise under constant pressure for grades . .

Tbe Nuclear Relula~ory 

Commission (NRC) bas been 
called to the scene of an active 
volcano on an undisclosed 
island in the Caribbean. 

Tbe volcano was discovered 
to be active late last week, and 
is considered a potential threat 
to residents living-within a five 
mile radiua of the site. The NRC 
wu called in to superviae 
.hutdown of the volcano and to 
conduct an inquiry into possible 
causes of the eruption. 

Tbe commission, still flushed 
with s~~ over the peodiDi 
shutdown of tbe dallla.ed 
nuclear reactor in PeDDl)'I· 
vania, issued a release 
yesterday detailinl tbe 
procedure it will uae to handle 
the volcano. Briefly, .the 
followiq step. will be taken: 

1) Two dozen advison will be 
flown in from Washington. 

2) Fifteen bureaucrat. will be 
flown in from key lovemment 
agencies. 
3) Press briefings will be held 

twice daily. 
4) A virgin will be sacrificed. 
ID a pre·dawn press 

conference this morniq, NRC · 
bead boncho Dwight David 
Elsenson explained tbe 
situation to a room full of tired, 
unkempt, and inattentive 
reporten. He is believed to 
have said, "My assessment of 
the situation as it now stands is 

Letter to the Editor 

that there is no immediate 
danger to residents living in the 
vicinity of the eruption site." 

He added, "However, we are 
keeping an eye out for potential 
complications. We have 
readied a fleet of kayak$ should 
evacuation become ~ neces-
sary." 

, 

At last report, the volcano 
was calm, and residents living 
nearby were likewise. Tbe NRC 
has warned, however, that 
people susceptible to res-
piratory problems should avoid 
breatbing the thick cloud of ash 
and sulfur dioxide covering the 
island. Children and the elderly 
have been warned to stay away 

,from Ilowiq rocks. 
The NRC has refrained from 

predictinl ' when shutdown 
migbt actually be accom-
plisbed. Speakin, off the 
record, one commission official 
cautioualy predicted that the 
situation would be under 
control "soon."

Passover Intent Clarified · 

Editor: 
Duriq this Passover week,I 

feel compelled to clarify the 
meaning of this Jewish holiday. 
This is a difficult task, because 
religion is such a personal 
matter, always open to 
individual interpretation. 
However ,I feel tbat my religion 
has been misrepresented in the 
Monday, April 9 issue of TIle 
Guardian, concerning Dawn 
WoHsberg's letter to the editor 
entitled, "Passover." Dawn 
writes, "Passover com-
memorates God's passing over 
the Hebrews while killing all of 
the Elyptian first born as the 
last of ten plagues inflicted 
upon the Egyptians ." An 
almost identical quote is found 
in Ran Anbar's flier sent to 
guests of UJS's April 11 Seder. 
If this were tbe standard 
interpretation, 1 would not be 
able to celebrate this 
"holiday. " 

Passover commemorates 
FREEDOM. The Hebrews 
achieved this freedom from 
slavery more than 3000 years 
ago when the Pharaoh set tIlem 
free to make exodui from 

~pt. The Hebrews packed up 
their few belongings in great 

hurry, for fear the Pharaob 
would change his mind. They 
left before the bread they were 
cooking was able to rise. 
Through symbolic recollection 
of this event, Jews eat Matzoh, 
the unleavened bread, during 
Passover week. 

Tbe celebration of Passover 
should not just be remembered 
by Jews, for anyone's ·freedom 
from bondage is worthy of 
commemoration. The famous 
Passover song, "Let My People 

-. 

Go," recalling Moses' Pleading 
to tbe Pharaoh for freedom for 
his people has been sung by 
Blacks in their stcuggle against 
oppression. 

Passover is 'in no way a 
holiday focused on com-
memorating pestilence or 
deatb to an adversary. It is the 
celebration of new life for an 
oppressed people - worthy of 
everyone's blessing.

Silly Vote Split? 
Editor: 

I object to your AS election 
coverage. This coverage, 
especially of the numerous 
campaign violation charges, 
has made the Montalvo and 
Hyman slates appear rather 
silly. This can only undermine 
the support of the Silly Slate. I 
am deathly afraid that as' tile 
election progresses, the Silly 
Siate'l rivals will be In-
creasingly viewed as silly 
which ~ould split the silly vote. 

I would not be happy if that 
happened.

Rhodesians Vote N-Plant Flawed Officers Cleared 

SALISBURY, Rhodesia (AP) - Undeterred by 
threats of guerrilla violence, blacks and whites 
turned out in large numbers yesterday to vote as 
equals on black majority rule. A hundred thousand 
soldiers guarded against sabotage attempts by black 
opposition guerrillas . 

In latest reports on the first day. at least 568,382 
people voted, said Eric Pope-Simmonds, registrar 
general. He said last night that the figure. covering 
only voting until 3 pm, equalled 20 percent of the 
nation 's electorate. The polls did not close until 7 pm 
(10 am PST) . 

The size of the turnout surprised even optimistic 
election officers. "It's startling," said one white 
official. 

The government hopes a large turnout will prompt 
political recognition of the breakaway British colony. 
which has been an international outcast since it 
unilaterally declared its independence in 1965. 

Amin Still Missing 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - The whereabouts of 

ousted dictator Idi Amin remained a rumor-shrouded 
mystery yesterday a week after the Ugandan capital 
of Kampala fell to Tanzanians and his exile enemies. 

While some reports placed him in Libya -
presumably a safe haven since 'Libyan leader 
Moammar Khadafy has been a staunch ally - others 
said he was in his northwestern Uganda tribal 
homeland. Still others said the self-proclaimed 
" president Cor life and conqueror of the British 
Empire" had fled to a neighboring country. 

Wherever he is. Kampala 's, 'lew government, still 
controlling only half the country, has declared that 
Amin will never come back. 

('His tyrannical regime will never come back, 
because the government has the capacity to continue 
the fight," said Ateker Ejalu.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Three Mile Island 
nuclear power plant and others built by Babcock & 
Wilson have a basic _design that makes them less 
tolerant of mistakes and harder to control if 
something goes wrong; a Nuclear Regulatory staff 
official says. 

Darrell G. Eisenhut, deputy director of the division 
of operating reactors, said in a recent interview, that 
Babc;ock & Wilson plant~ use only one-third as much 
water as competing desiins to generate steam, 
leaving less capacity to cool the reactor if normal 
circulation breaks down. 

Insufficient cooling can damage the reactor core, 
as happened at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, 
raising the threat of a melt-down which would release 
large amounts oC radioactivity to the atmosphere.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Two police officers acted in 
self-defense when they fatally shot a 39-year-old· I 
woman who threw an U-inch kitchen knife at them, 
District Attorney John Van de Kamp said yesterday 
in deciding not to charge the officers with any crime . 

Based on interviews with S2 persons, includiq 10

concluded in a 37-page report released yesterday that 
the shooting of Eula Love on Jan. 3 - followiq a 
dispute over an unpaid $22.09 gas bill - was 
justifiable homicide. 

But he added that the shooting raises serious

ftriteria for candidate selection. 
. A third candidate Is from the 
University of Florida, while the 
last two are from the State 
University of New York at 

Stony Brook and the University 
of Southern Colorado. All five 
semi-finalists are men. 

Durinl the next several 
weeks the five candidates will 
visit UCSD for interviews and 
meetings with students and 
administrators. The search 
committee will select . two or 
three finalists from among the 
candidates to recommend to 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage, ' 

. according to Ernst. 
Ernst commented that the 

committee looked for can-
didates who could be good 
managers and who could "deal 
well with students." All five 
men, he said, have had 
extensive experience with 
student facilities . 

The new director will replace 
Acting Student Center Director 
Diane Annala. who has held the 
position since February . 
Annala did not run for the new 
director position and serves on 
the search committee. 

The director's position has 
been beset with changes the 
past year. Annala has filled the 
post since it was left vacant 
after the second resignation 
this year In February. 

In addition to supervising 
various functions of the Student 
Center, the new director will 
work closely with the AS by 

providing " long-range ad-
vising" and a "legal basis" for 
the student government, 
according to Jenkel. 

Jenkel explained that he 
"didn't feel that the' student 
government was being 
properly advised" and needed 
someone who could link the AS 
to Student Affairs . After 
neloUaU.., with Armitage, the 
director's job description was 
expanded to include student 
responsibilities, said Jenkel. 

Because of tJie director's 
additional duties, he will 
receive a salary between 
$20.196 and- $26 . 772 , an 
increase over past director's 
incomes. Registration fees and 
student activity fees will 
equally contribute to the 
director's salary. according to 
Jenkel. 

Ernst said the committee 
hopes to provide Armitage with 
a final recommendation by the 
second week in May. Armitage 
will then $elect the new 
director. who will ta ke office by 
the first of July. according to 
Ernst. . 

Each of the five candidates 
will spend a day and a half on 
campus during their visit. said 
Jenkel. They will meet with AS 
members at an informal buCCet, 
meet with Student Center 
Board members for lunch ,

Higher Oxidant Le~els Now Permitted 
By' Doug Campion 

Sdeaee Editor 
The Environmental Pro-

tection Agency (EPA) recently 
relaxed its air pollution 
standards to allow 541% more of 
certain chemical pollutants to 
be present- in the air than had 
been permitted previously. 

EPA Allows 500/0 More of Pollutant After Study 
humans, they would be used as 
"indicators" of the possi-
bilities. 

The chemicals are called 
" photochemical oxidants," 
strong oxidizing compounds, 
and the most abundantis ozone. 
a very reactive form of oxygen. 
The substances are different 
from many other pollutants in 
that, rather than being emitted 
directly into the air, they result 
from a reaction between 
nitrogen oxides and organic 
compounds exposed to 
sunlight. 

In April of 1971 the EPA 
established the National 
Ambient Air Quality Stan-
dards, regulations mandating, 
amone other things, that each 
of the states maintain its air. 
quality such that the amount of 
photochemical oxidants 
present in the atmosphere not 
exceed an hourly average of 
0.08 parts per million (ppm). 
This restriction was decided 
upon after a lengthy examina-
tion of the medical, scientific 
and technical data available at 
that time. In the years 
following, though, further 
studies were conducted which 
many claimed demonstrated 
that the EPA regulation was too 
strict. 

In Juneof last year, the EPA 
proposed a slight relaxation of 
the '71 regulation. After almost 
eight months of hearings , 
study , evaluation and numer-
ous comments from concerned 
members of industry and the 
general public, the agency 
revised the National Ambient 
Air Quality Standards for 
photochemical oxidants to 
allow an hourly average of 0.12 
ppm - half again as much as 
had been allowed before and an 
increase 0.02 ppm greater than 
had initially proposed. 

Regarding some evidence of 
adverse health effects resulting 
from the presence of ozone in 
the atmosphere, the EPA noted 
in the Federal Register that the 
current evidence was often 
ambiguous and difficult to 
apply to humans in the setting 
of a natural environment. The 
agency even confessed that 
some of the previous reports 
had in fact been misin-
terpreted . In any event, 
according to the agency , the 
data available did not indicate 
a necessity for imposing 
regulations as restrictive as 
had earlier been adopted. 

In an effort to ensure that the 
effects of the chemicals on 
human health and the 
environment were carefully

considered before the revisions 
of the standards became 
effective, the EPA conducted a 
year-long review of the most 
recent data concerning 
photochemical oxidants. From 
that information survey, the 
agency summarized several 
major findings in the Federal 
Register . 

pulmonary irritant, ozone is the 
chemical which brings about 
the coughing, wheezing and 
tightness of the chest 
experienced by most athletes 
on a smoggy day. Surveys also 
jndicated that a greater 
number of asthmatics experi-
ence attacks on days when the 
ozone concentration is 
"elevated" than do on an 
average day. 

Experiments also showed 
that laboratory animals 
became more susceptible to 
infection when exposed to ozone 
and then to bacteria than they 
were when exposed to the 
bacteria alone. The EPA noted 
that although effects on lab 
animals could not be directly 
ex tra polated to apply to 

Just as the oxidants act to 
make plastics and rubber more 
brittle, there is some evidence 
that exposure to the compounds 
may also accelerate the aging 
process in living organisms. 
Symptoms such as calcification 
of cartilage and depletion of 
body fat have been observed in 
rabbits exposed to ozone in the 
laboratory. 

Another effect noted was that 
high concentrations of ozone, in 
combination with high levels of 
sulfur dioxide , anotber 
component of smog, acted to 
produce larger changes in the 
functioning of the IUDls than 
did exposure to either chemical 
alone. The margin of safety 
allowed through the use of the 
threshold concept took this. and 
the other health effects Int. 
account. 

Probably the mostimportant 
to understand of these findings 
was the most general. That is, 
photochemical oxidants do 
indeed present certain 
potential dangers to human 
health. For this reason the 
agency utilized what it labeled 
the "threshold concept." From 
the information available, the 
EPA determined a level of 
concentration at which the 
oxidants begin to affect human 
health . This ' is the threshold. 
Because the 'experimentation 
with ozone was done in a 
laboratory setting with 
essentially healthy people as 
subjects, the newly specified 
standards allow for inaccuracy 
by establishing a permitted 
concentration of pollutants at a 
much lower level than the 
threshold.

One of the more common 
health effects noted by the 
agency was the irritation of the

Frosh Badminton Junkie Reaches No.1 
Vietnamese Immigrant Mastered 
Game in Long Summer Hours 

By John Klock 
Senior Staff Writer 

Internationally, the best 
badminton players are from 
the Orient, but Lan Ngoc Ta 
never played the game in the 15 
years she lived in Vietnam. 

Today, four years after she 
came with her family to the 
United States , the 4'10 " 
freshman is the top women's 
intercollegiate badminton 
player at UCSD , and she 
learned her game on the courts 
of San Diego ' s Federal 
Duilding. 

"In the summer we used to 
start around 10 in the morning 
and stay there till about 10 at 
nigbt,, :: she said . Mike 
VanderGriend, intercollegiate 
badminton coach, said she was 
a "badminton junkie" in high 
school, where shewas second in 
her league in her junior year. 

How has she done against 
college level competition? " If 
we stay in Division Two next 
year, Lan should be one of the 
top players in the league," 
VanderGriend said. 

"She's not afraid to play 
anyone," h«f added. 

Although height is an 
advantage in badminton, speed 
is more important, the coach 
said, and Ta " eels around the 

court pretty well. " 
He also gives her credit for a 

"very intelligent game." The 
precise drop shots and booming 
clear shots that keep an 
opponent chaSing around the ' 
court require more skill than 
physical capability. 

Still, Ta acknowledges that if 
she were really serious about 
the sport, she would do a lot of 
skipping 1 0pe, jogging and 
drills . Her weakest point is 
probably " strength, " meaning 
stamina to last through three 
long games as well as power to 
slam a shuttlecock through 
opponents' defenses. 

" I' m just playing for fun, " 
she insists. She wants to WiD 
and do as well as she can, but 
Lan Ta doesn't have any 
speCific goals or ambitions for 
her badminton playing. 

Although she manages the 
two hours of practice required 
daily, she has other things on 
her mind these days. After 
winning awards and top grades 
in bigh school (she was 
valedictorian at San Diego 
High), she is struggling with 
college work. 

Among her Vietnamese 
friends, she said, that 
experience is typical. Unlike 
some, though, she had little

trouble learning English. In 
fact, her move to the U.S. was 
not very traumatic. 

"I was glad to come to 
America," she said. "I was 
excited." She made a face 
remembering the tents her 
family had to live in when they 
first lelt Vietnam. They were 
sponsored before long by their 
former Vietnamese neighbors, 
who had fnoved to San Diego 
earlier. 

Her parents were reluctant. 
They did not want to leave their 
relatives at first, but Ta's older 
brothers and sisters insisted on 
making the move, and their 
parents came along. 

"They 're glad they came, 
now," she said. Things are 
better in America, starting 
with freedom of speech , 
according to Ta. Her father, a 
former businessman from the 
Saigon area, is now a keypunch 
operator. 

Her memories of Vietnam 
include very strict schools, 
where students wore uniforms, 
and corporal punishment was 
common. One thing she does 
not recall is sports. 

Dy contrast with her 
experience in Vietnam, Lan Ta 
has tried many different sports 
in the U.S. She doesn't like 
tennis, basketball or any other 
"strength" sport she's tried, 
but for five months she's been 
enjoying table tennis. 

Considering that she used to 
type 78 words per minute, it 
should not be surprisng that she 

excels at sports requiring a lot 
of quickness aDd manual 
dexterity. 

VanderG riend readily 
acknowledges that her talent 
makes him look good . "I think 
she's gotten good coaching, but 
I didn't have that much to do 
with how well she's done," he 
confessed. 

Some of ttie be~t coaching the 
team has gotten so far, 
according to VariderGriend , is 
from strong players in the San 
Diego area who come to talk to 
the team. • 

Foremost among them lSi 
Cheryl Carlton , whom 
VanderGriend ranks as one of 
the ' top two women In the 
nation. She is an employee at 
UCSD, and :'1 call her up and 
she comes in," he said. 

For someone who plays .. an 
intelligent game," such tips 
can be the winning edge. Lan 
Ta may be very glad some day' 
that she feU into the high-
powered badminton coaching 
available at UCSD, and UCSV' 
may be just a8 glad. 

Lan Ngoc Ta is the No. 1 intercollegiate women's singles 
badminton player and half of the top mixed doubles and women's 
doubles teams. ~ • ." .........

. Shapiro'S Upset 
Stops Tennis Skunk 

By Pam Gold 
Despite Debbie Shapiro's stunning 6-1, 6-0 

upset of USIU's sectionally first ranked 
Kathy Turner, the UCSD women's tennis 
team fell in an otherwise overwhelming a-I 
rout. 

Coach Pat Stewart remarked, " Debbie's 
unyielding play led her to a decisive 
victory." 

In other well played singles games, Lisa 
Winsten fell. to USIU·s third singles in a 
three set battle, 0-6, 6-4, 7-5, hitting steady 
a nd hard . 

. ·Unfortunately. Lisa was plagued by bad 
calls," according to Coach Stewart. 

Amy Odland lost a tough 2nd singles 
match, 6-2, 6-0 with the scores a poor 
indication of the quality of play. 

Stewart explained, "Our players fared 
respectably against USIU, a team in which 
the top four women a re on athletic 
scholarships. Our usual firstsingles , Cecilia 
Kavanaugh, could not play because of a 
previous obligation. With her, the match 
would have been cut much closer. "

Zeffirelli's 'Champ' Wallows In Goo 
F or sentimentality to be effective, it must strike quickly and by sur-

prise. The Champ, however, 
telegraphs its sentimentality 
and then wallows in it to such an 
ex tent that prospective viewers 
may be turned off. But The 
Champ is saved from being a 
tota l failure by an endearing 
performance by eight-year-old 
newcomer Ricky Schroder. 

wants TJ . Now the mother 
fights to win TJ's love and Dilly 
returns to the ring to win T J 's 
respect. 

The original Champ was an 
economical, 9O-minute feature 
whose gritty black and white 
photography and slum sf'ttings 
counterbalanced the se nti -
mentnlil v or tl,, ' <:!f'Ji'v F'r:l ~." 
Zeffirelli 's Champ, though, has 
no such equilibrium. Hi s film 
lacks the simplicity of the 

original as well as the economy. 
The new Champ is drawn out to 
two hours with every scene 
culminating in a major crisis 
(e.g. TJ 's horse taking a fall , 
Billy losing the horse 
gambling). Editing in a more 
succinct style, The Champ 
could have been accepta ble to a 
wider audience. 

The film also suffers .from 
other excesses. Whereas 
Zeffirelli's luminous cine-
matography complemented his 

Romeo and Juliet , in lhe 
Champ it merely adds sugar to 
honey and makes things too 
gooey. 

Zeffirelli succeeds best in his 
direction of Schroder as T J . 
The Champ supports the old 
adage " never act with children 
or animals" because Schroder 
steals the movie (rom the more 
experienced hands of Voight 
and Dunaway. Schroder, a 
remarkably unartificial actor, 
gives a touching performance 

that transcends the scnmaltz. 
Voight and Dunaway give Cine 
portrayals in roles that demand 
little ,more than crying. 

Because The Champ is a one-
note film, its audience is 
limited. If you enjoy sen-
timentality and a good cry then 
The Champ will be satilfying; 
if you are cynical and hard-
bitten then The Champ will be a 
bore . The Champ is now 
playing at UTC and Cente'" 3 
Cinemas. 

The Champ is a remake of the 
1931 MGM classic of the same 
name, and Jon Voight and 
Schroder take on the roles 
created by Wallace Beery and 
Jackie Cooper . The film 
Cocuses on a young boy's blind 
idolization of his champion-
turned-bum father . Father and 
son live by themselves (the 
mother left when the boy, TJ, 
was one) in Florida where the 
Cather, Billy. makes a measly 
living walking horses . Although 
Billy drinks and gambles, he 
and T J lead a happy life 
because of their strong mutual 
love. But into the picture walks

"You kBow , y'know? All these things in-Ureroom become'part o( 

same thing and there's nothing to do but watch these same 
thi ngs ... fJy apart, take wings and fly off, discorporate and become 
part of something else all togetller, the larger picture, something 
bigger than a bread box ... " 

Digby thought John 's voice sounded like a saxophone solo, his 
deep well-modulated voice, with the hint of grit somewhere in the 
middle o( each syllable. running the words together in a variety of 
rhythms , tonal nuance and sudden multi-voweled flourishes that 
made the string of sentences seem to dance around a melody that 
played in Digby 's middle ear. John paused and stared out of the 
window and noted that the sun was shining through the branches of 
a backyard crabapple tree, which was stark and leafless since the 
advent of autumn. 

"The s.un 's got varicose veins," he said, pOinting in the garage 
twilight. " Look at that goddamned thing." 

Digby looked at the sun and walked over to the side door. He 
stopped there and shook his head again and again, faster with each 
rota tion. looking like a boxer trying to regain his wits. He began to 
murmur. 

"They say in two billion years." he said, at last audible, " that 
the sun'll die and leave us something ... cold ... and that 's bigger 
than a bread box. Age is something man ... it just sneaks up on 
you ... " 

John walked past Digby, brushing against his shoulder, opened 
the door and walked outside. He took several breaths of the air. 
and pondered the vapor escaping from his mouth. The sun was a 
diseased yellow. ·now obstructed by rooftops and a network of 
television antennas that made him think of the feet of thousands of 
dead crows. The sky was a streaky grey , the color of frost that 
forms overnight on windshields. Digby walked up behind John, 
who turned around at the sound of his feet trampling leaves. 

"Here we go again." said John, "the cycle, the same old 
turnabout. the flawle,s clockwork of things beyond our 
understanding. Feel that air ... " 

Digby slumped against tbe garage and let his weight drag him 
slowly to the ground . He sagged until he was seated in a pile of red 
and orange leaves that he's raked up the day before. -

"Keep talking, John, say something long and warm ... " 
John looked at him and smiled a smile as big as the bend of the 

road. He reached out and helped Digby to his feet and brushed the 
leaves off his shoulders and pants. 

"I love '10U," said Digby. 
John's :,mile shrank to a small ' 0 ' in the center of his face. He 

replaced it with a nervous. twitching thin-lipped smirk. He took his 
eyes from Digby and stared at the ground: candy wrappers. a 
cigarette butt, brown grass, a plastic baggie, dead leaves. Digby 
put his hand on John's shoulder. 

" [ love you," he repeated. 
John, head still bowed. grabbed his hand on his Shoulder and 

gave it a tight squeeze, with his fingertips rubbing Digby's cold 
wrist. Suddenly, he knocked it off, and stood straight up. His face 
was blank, as though a light had gone 'Out in his eyes. 

"John ... " 
" Fuck it. .. let 's get gOing. Gotta get there . Let's go. They won't

Digby stared at the sun. till caught in crow' feet, and thought it

played din of electronic flash. 
with McLaughlin and the band 
undertaking a pOintless. 
unimaginative, seemingly 
~andom cacophony of speedy 
riffs that never jelled. The 
concert lacked even the callous 
cleverness McLaughlin has 
become known for. 

Well , surprise. Electric 
Dreams, the One Truth Band's 
'first release with McLaughlin, 
is everything their concert 
wasn·t. The six musicians -
McLaughlin. L. Shanker on 
violin , Stu Goldberg on 
keyboards , Fernando Sanders 
on bass, Tony Smith on drums 
and Alyrio Lima on percussion 
- ha ve consolidated their skills 
into a fully integrated unit and 
display a distinct musical 
identity. McLaughlin himself. 
the principal songwriter here. 
has taken on a new maturity as 
a composer as well . Where 
much of his writing in the past 
seemed to be little more than 
tricky unison parts. employing 
Indian and neo-classical modes 
with little substantive guts 
underneath the dizzying 
dexterity, Electric Dreams 
material cuts a wider swath. 
The band's unified character 
gives the variety of approaches 
-Basie blues, poly-tonal funk, 
Coltranish chases - a 
coherence that last year's 

recipe hodgepodge, Johnny 
McLaughlin. Electric Gui-
tarist , lacked. Unlike Electric 
Guitarist , a session where 
McLaughlin employed dif-
ferent musicians on each track, 
Electric Dreams has a central 
character. This album is by a 

band, not a lineup of guest star 
soloists. 

The high points on the album 
are many, but especially 
exciting is " The Dark Prince," 
a Coltrane stretch of expanded ' 
bop where McLaughlin fuses 
the melodic sense and chordal 
strategies of Dolphy and 
Parker with the cardiac arrest 
tempo of his Mahavishnu 
period . Though the purist 

elements of the jazz audience 
might dismiss this tract as 
mere facile Clash and 
showboating for its own salte. 
McL-aughlin's solos are 
nonetheless crisP. concise. 
elegantly phrased and to the 
point. The closing guitar-

keyboard shootout between ' 
him and Goldberg is an 
enthralling example of two 
musicians pushing themselves 
to their respective creative 
limits . "Mihis Davis" (so

return compliment to the

Poodles Fabulous~ Despite Silly Name 
I t Is difficult to conceive of a more I ntrlnslcally silly 

name for a rock bancfthan "The 
Fabulous Poodles." Say it out 
loud - don't you feel 
ridiculous? Naturally, I 
expected the BOngs ' of this 
British group to be app~ 
prialely frivolous, clilesy 
smartus rock In the tradition 
of Sparks, Deaf SchOQI, Devo 
and the like. An actuallisteblng 
tAMirror SIan, the Poodles' US 
debut album, proved me wrong 
- their lyrics are amusing 
without belDl inane and their 
music is surprisingly strong 
and almost paSsionate. 

Tbe _t reference pointa for 
' the Poodles' stJle are the 
KJoks, the Who and Elvis 
CoItelio - their tunes are in the 
f.t-moYiDl rock siDlles mode 

that seems to be regaJOlIlg 
popularity these days. The 
guitar work on Mirror Scars is 
pleasingly straightforward, 
carrying the melody along 
simply but forcefully. ' Dobby 
Valentino's violin (played 
pizzicato style on a number of 
cuts, unusual in rock) and 
mandoHn add color to the basic 
arrangements. Lead vocalist 
Tony de Meur (sly pun, no?) 
sings with just enough apparent 
conv\ction to give the satirical 
songs emotional impact. 

Lyricist John Parsons 
tempers his humor with a 
certain human empathy, not 
unlike Ray Davies in his better 
moments . "Mirror Star" 
celebrates the rise of an 
introverted kid (';He ~alked 
the streets inside hiS headl And 
spent a lot of time in bed") to 

rock star fame. Modern love 
and its complications are 
examined in "Oh Cheryl" and 
"Cherchez La Femme." "Mr. 
Mike" treats sex in a flippant 
Elvis Costelloesque manner 
("My lips are dancing so 
close/To y~ur diaphragm/ 
Saying - 'Baby, I'm your 
man' "). More specialized 
themes are covered also : 
obsolete hair styles, B movies, 
mammary camera work ("Tit 
Photographer Blues") . 
Occasionally the songs veer 
into the sophomoric and trivial, 
but on the whole the Poodles' 
numbers are runny stories with 
a point. . 

Expect to be more than 
tickled by Mirror Stars -
there's punchy, we II-cra f ted

market in 1976. By that time 
Richman bas assembled a new 
version of his band and. was 
recordilll 8 batch of tunes 
rather different from his 
previous work. 

Maybe it was depression over 
his stalled career; perhaps 
romantic troubles were the 
cause - in any case, 
Richman's songwriting on his 
second album hints that he had 
become a victim of psycho-
logical regression, retreating 
from personal relationships 
into a fantasy land of his own 
making . 1£ The Modern Lovers 
expresses the attitudes or a 
teenager, Jonathan Richman 
ADd The Modern Lovers 
reflects a pre-adolescent mind 
rejeCting' adult conflicts and 
complexities. 

On this long-delayed spot' lid 
album Richman pays cheerrul 
tribute to his nati ve region I 
("New England"), the majesty 
of tall city buildings ("Lonely 
Financial Zone") and the 
peculiar appeal of suburban 
malls ("Rockin' Shopping 
Center") . These songs, though, 

are unremarkable compared to 
the curious fantasies the ' 
reassembled Modern Lovers 
delve into elsewhere -
" Abominable Snowman In The-
Market, " "Hey There Little 
Insect" and the strangest o.r all , . 
"Here Come the Martian 
Martians," a loony daydream 
about alien beings out of place 
in ordinary America. In this 
catchy 50s-style rock number 
Richman describes the 
Martians' troubles on earth -
they stay at cheap hotels and 
are forced to open a Kool-Aid 
stand to raise money . 

The Modern Lovers perform 
the tune with a Iighthe~rted air, 
but I can' t help but worry about 
its composer - after his early 
attempts to gain acceptance in 
the human world, Richman's 
descriptions oT imaginary 
playmates isn't as amusing as 
he intends it to be. 

On his third Ip, Rock & Roll 
With The Modern Lovers, 
Richman descends ever deeper 
into kiddie concerns while 
attempting to strip down his 
band's instrumentation to the 
barest essentials. Rock &,Roll 
is entirely acoustic and rounds 
as if it were recorded on a $50 
Sears portable cassette unit. 
The songs here are ultrasimple

lyrically as well, expressionS of 
Richman's increasingly eerie 
beatific vision (the Santa Cruz 
roller coaster, he tells us, 
" knocked me out of myhead"). 
He chose to close the album 
with an a cappella version of 
the traditional hymn "Angels 
Watching Over Me" - things 
were at the point where 
Richman needed divine 
.protection to continue his 
blissfully escapist existence. 

His latest effort, Back In 
Your Life , comes as something 
or a relief after these last two 
albums. His best Ip since The 
Modern Lovers, Richman is 
indeed back in the lives of his 
fellow human beings, with lots 
to say about relationships and 
emotional growth. The music 
(once again electric) is crisper 
and more a/isertive than It's 
been in a while, partly due to 
the improved production 
quality. Modern Lovers Leroy 
Radcliffe (guitar), Asa 
Brebner (bass) and D. Sharpe 
(drums) present themselves 
well, playing strongly rhythmic 
pop-rock, though as usual the 
focal point is Richman's voice, 
decidedly modest in range but 
oddly charming and effective. 

"I'm .. man, not a boy," 
Richman declares in "(She's 

Gonna) Respect Me," quite a 
statement after his re~n~ odes 
to ice cream vendors and 
amusement parks. Somehow 
he has gained a new self-
confidence, to the degree that, 
in "My Love Is A Flower (Just 
Beginning To Bloom) ," he can . 
offer his girlfriend patient 
understanding in her struggle 
to mature. Richman obliquely 
comments upon his recent 
fantasy excursions in "Af-
rection," urging his- listeners 
not to hide their feelings out of 
fear of rejection ("People all 
over the world are good/People 
all over the world ain't badlBut 
if they keep on chickening 
out/They won't get what they 
wished they had - Affection' ') . 

All Jonathan Richman has 
ever seemed to want out o(life 
is the chance to love things -
people, nature, magical beings. 
After following his career for 
years I'm pleased to see his 
boundless warmth and 
disarming wit once again being 
directed towards real friends 
and sweethearts. (r Back In 
Your Life doesn't give us 
Richman as an especially 
modern lover, it does present 
him as a winningly sincere one 
- a sensitive, almost saintly 
rock and roller .

Unlike Derkeley police . 
however. UC campus police 
often issue citations for the 
public use of marijuana. The 
initiative also directs UC police 
to assign lowest priority to 
marijuana law enforcement. 

Still. the lack of controversy 
over the initiative failed to 
dampen the enthusiasm of its 
supporters: They organized an 
ev.ent which drew more 
publicity. locally and nation-
ally. than anything else in the 
otherwise bland campaign-- the

that she planned to give free

keep them " h a ppy and

The divestment initiatives 
were similarly unopposed. 

Even Mayor Warren Widener 
a moderate characterized in 
the past by his failure to take a 
stand on divestment. came out 
well before the election in favor 
of Measures " A" and "D." 

The measures ban the deposit 
of city money in banks ; with 
direct or indirect ties to South 
Africa . and establish a nine-
member citizens committee to 
carry through the process of 
divestment. 

Late last night. the highly 
contested mayors race between 
Widener and his more radical 
opponent Gus Newport was too 
close to call. Newport's slate 
was doing unexpectedly well in 
the race for four city council 
seats.

According to committee Co-
chair Diane Annala . the 
proposed amphitheatre will be 
the first facility on campus to 
which students have first 
priority. HIt will be the first 
time students havea place to be 
used for a good time." said 
Annala. 

The Amphitheatre Planning 
Committee. set up as an 
advisory group to the 
Chancellor, has been meeting 
since the beginning of winter 
quarter . The committee 
consists of student and staff 
members, and is co-chaired by 
Annala and AS President John 
Jenkel . 

Annala said the planned 
amphitheatre will . "without a

decided Friday she will not be a

thus leaving Jamie Mont-

dOUbt," increase the number of 
events at UCSD . " It will 
provide (UniverSity E vents) 
with more freedom to choose 
events." she said. 

. According toAnnala. UE will 
have " simple access" to the 
amphithea tre - " that 's 
something we can't have with 
the gym." 

"Even if we get the gym. 
most concerts are t\10 
expensive to put in a 2000-seat 
gym ... the promoters don 't 
want to deal with this campus 
because it doesn ' t pay ." 
remarked Annala. 

At San Diego State Uni-
versity , where an amphi-
theatre has operated success-
fully for many years. problems 
have arisen due to the facillty 's 
proximity to Love Library. 
Currently . there are no 

productions at the amphi -
th eatre during the week 
beca use of ' poss ible study 
di sruptions. according to Niam 
Shabazz. assistant director of 
Aztec Ce nter. 

Committee memb er s a t 
UCSD ha ve expressed concerns 
that a simila r situa tion would 
occur here due to the proposed 
amphitheatre' s proximity to 
Central Library. 

According to committee 
members, alternatives to the 
Central Library site were 
considered but due to logistical 
difficulties, such as parking 
and power access . were 
eliminated. The noise problem 
at the Central site will be 
minimized by a stage sound 
shell aimed away from the 
libra ry. added the committee 
members.

Each machine will cost about $50 to repair. $25 for materials 
and $25 for labor, he added. . 

The AS and the colleges have not yet decided whether to 
accept the McElroy decision. but one AS spokesman said it was 
likely they would, with some modifications. 

"Ttlere has to be a limit on the number of years the 
administration can use its share to payoff the food services 
debt. Otherwise they- could go on using that money forever . 
Also. there should be some adjustment for infla~ion , McElroy 
says we ' lI get $30.000 every year. but revenues are going to go 
uP. and we want to keep the same percentage share." the 
spokesman said. 

In addition, Nancy Laga, Vending Machine Task Force 
leader said yesterday . the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, 
who would have jurisdiction over the money under McElroy's 
proposal . should not be part of the process of distributing the 
revenues [rom the machines. 

The money should instead go directly to the Deans. Laga said .
