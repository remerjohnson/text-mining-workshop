Gene Smps Broken Hearts 
RESEARCH: New study uses mice to arrest the progression of heart failure 
By PEr! PRATO 
Guardian Reporler 

Cardiac researchers at the 
UCSD School of Medicine 
found that the progression of 
heart failure can be fully arrest-
ed by inhibiting a single gene. 

The study, led b7 Kenneth 
Chien, professor 0 medicine 
and director of the UCSD-Salk 

Program in Molecular 
Medicine, combined genetiC 
engineering and cross-breeding 
in mice to inhibit the gene phos-
pholamban (PLB). 

PLB is one of a family of cal-
cium-cycling genes, whose pur-
pose is to regulate the distribu-
tion of calcium within the cells 
of the heart. 

It is necessary for the heart 

to receive this calcium, because 
it is what activates cardiac con-
traction. When genetic defects 
are the cause of heart failure, 
this regulatory system begins to 
fail. The inhibition of PLB can 
be used to counteract this. 

Normally, PLB acts as a

UCSA 
Agenda 
Vetoed 
COUNCIL: Item would 
have advocated financial 
aid for student-parents 
By JENNIFER KAPlAN 
Staff Writer 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
vetoed approval of the 
University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) agenda last 
Friday after the A.s. Council 
approved it. 

UCSA is an organization that 
produces annual education cam-
paigns for students. 

The annual agenda put forth 
by UCSA is the backbone of the 
group's campaigns. The plan is 
ubject to approval by all stu-

dent governments at UC cam-
p.uses. 

Khullar said since the $20,000 
that the A.S. Council spends on 
UCSA comes from student activi-
ties fees, the student body as a 
whole should benefit from the 
agenda items. 

He said that none of the three 
items on UCSA's agenda did so. 

"At least one of the three 
issues we are advocating for 
needs to affect all students," he 
said. 

The agenda item which 
Khullar opposed advocated pro-
viding financial aid for students 
who are parents. 

He said he had to veto the 
entire legislation because the 
agenda items were submitted as 
one piece of legislation. 

After Khullar's veto, the 
agenda items were resubmitted 
into last night's new business as 
three separate items. Members 
of the A.S. internal affairs com-
mittee are scheduled to vote on 
the agenda items next 
Wednesday. 

The other two items on 
UCSA's agenda are the prevent-
ing of hate crime and increaSing 
the representation of minority 
faculty members. 

Khullar said that he fully sup-

Global Climate May Change Significantly 
WARMINa: Study shows that ice age ended with abrupt climate changes, contradicting previous studies 
By MARIA CAITELLANOS 
Guerdllf) Reporter 

Scientists at UCSD's Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography (SlO) 
and Washington State 
University (WSU) have deter-
mined that the end of the last ice 
age wu triggered by an abrupt 
period of wal'lning that beaan In 
the North Atlantic about Is,ooo 
years ago. 

The recent study contradIcts 

previous studies which conclud-
ed that the dramatic ,P.Uiod of 
warming was triggered by circu-
lation changes in the tropics, 
which are commonly believed to 
be the regions that drive global 
climate d\ange. 

Jeff Severinghaus, assistant 
r=:ar in the Scripps 

'ences Research Division 
and lead author of the study that 
was published in the Oct. 29 
issue of Sciena, said that the new 

evidence changes the way scien-
tists understand climate change. 

"Although it is still impossi-
ble to make any kind of predic-
tions as to the next significant cli-
mate change due to the uncover-
ing of this new evidence, it is 
now more important to empha-
size that climate can change 
quickly:' he said. "It is not a 
smooth and gradual change as 
previously thought. This can be 
shown in such weather disrup-

tions such as EI Nino." 
Severinghaus said that the 

study may help scientists predict 
future climate changes. 

"We know that over the next 
100 years the earth will probably 
warm because of the greenhouse 
effect, and there is a remote pos-
Sibility that we may trigger one 
of these abrupt climate events," 
he stated. "So, it is very impor-

VETO: 
Patterson supported 
Khullar's actions 

ports the first two issues, but 
feels strongly that the third 
should affect the I'ntire student 
body rather than just students 
with children. 

He added that if the council 
passes the third agenda item, he 
will veto it. 

The UCSA agenda was for-
mulated during a UCSA con-
gress meeting held at UCSD this 
summer. Every year this com-
mittee develops an agenda of 
issues for individual UC student 
governments to address and 
support. 

A.S. Vice President External 
Terrance Patterson said that 

"ICE AGE: 
Scientists studied air 
trapped in glaciers 

tant that we understand the 
underlying mechanisms behind 
them." 

Although the research will 
not lead to the prevention of 
global warming or the green-
house effect, it does make both 
scientists and citizens more 
aware of the importance of find-
ing other energy sources, 
Severinghaus added. 

Scientists from S10 and WSU 
used the air bubbles trapped in 
Greenland Summit glaciers to 
determine when the warming 
began. 

Severinghaus said that ice 
glaciers like these are about 10

The UCSA agenda was

UCSA congress meeting

summer. Every year this 
committee develops an

"Some people felt it was a

"Some stood up and personal-

percent air bubbles, which are 
trapped when snow is compacted 
into ice. In places such as 
Greenland where the snow never 
melts, the air bubbles are pre-
served, and the snow is more 
than 100,000 years old. 

To retrieve the air bubbles, 
researchers drilled a hole in the 
glacier and extracted ice cores, 
which are then studied to deter-
mine changes in the composition 
of the bubbles. 

Researchers used a new tech-
nique based on thermal diffuSion, 
in which changes in isotopic 
ratios of argon and nitrogen in 
the ice core were used to develop 
a gas-based temperature record 
for Greenland near the end of the 
last ice age. They then compared 
the record to the changes in trop-
ical climate over the same time 
period.

ized it saying things like their 
mom depended on financial aid 
to go through school. It won by a 
small margin of something like 
two votes. I think we should 
keep working toward issues 
about student parents, but not 
necessarily make it an action 
item." 

He added that the A.S. 
Council should address in some 
other way the problems faced by 
student parents. 

"1 think it is a definite issue we 
should be looking at," he said. 
"It is important to address the 
bigger issue that effects more stu-
dents." 

Khullar and Patterson both 
fought in favor of lowering costs 
for students at the UCSA con-
gress meeting last summer. 

Khullar said that students at 
other UC campuses are also chal-
lenging the agenda item. 

Severinghaus discovered that 
since the period of rapid warm-
ing was first seen at high north-
ern latitudes, the end of the ice 
age was offset by changes in cir-
culation of the North Atlantic 
that caused heat from the equator 
to be transported to Europe and 
the poles. They determined that 
the Greenland Summit warmed 
by approximately 16 degrees 
Fahrenheit over a period of sever-
al decades, followed by the 
climbing of temperatures in the 
tropics 20 to 80 years later. 

"Our data clearly show that 
the tropical climate lags the 
Greenland climate by at least 20 
years, so that means the tropics 
could not have triggered the 
event," Severinghaus said. "Our 
work does not, however, rule out 
that the tropics play a role in 
amplifying warming once it 
begins."

Media Offers No New 
Information 011 Crash 

Early Sunday morning, an EgyptAir flight carry-
ing 217 people flying out of New York bound for 
Cairo crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. killing all on 
board. We at the Guardian feel that this is a tragedy 
and our sympathies go out to all who lost loved ones 
in the crash. 

At the same time. we also feel that the media is 
giving the crash too much attention. Since the plane 
crashed. there have been very few new develop-
ments, and yet the story has dominated the newspa-
pers and the nightly news. Shortly after the crash, we 
were continually told the same information: that no 
one survived the crash, that there is no known cause 
and how fast the plane fell. In order to fill time. the 
news programs show us the precise specifications of 
the type of aircraft that crashed. We have seen count-
less clips of the Boeing 767-300 aircraft. We have 
been shown pictures of family members grieving. 
Now we are beginning to see in depth reporting on 
scuba diving operations so that we will know exactly 
how the wreckage will be recovered. 

We tum to news media for news. not for a constant 
repetition of information. The Guardian feels that if 
there are no new developments in the story. the media 
should cut ba~k on their coverage and allow other 
stories with more substance to be run. 

Temperature Dependent 
Soda Prices Are Unfair 

Coca-Cola has developed a new technology for 
vending machines that can sense hot weather and 
increase the price of the soda it dispenses accord-
ingly. This new machine was revealed in a Brazilian 
newsmagazine but has not yet been marketed. Coca-
Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester said that 
demand for a cold drink increases in the summer 
heat, and thus it is only fair that the drink be more 
expensive. 

The concept of using a person's basic need for a 
cold drink to make more money is unethical and 
inhumane. Coca-Cola is already a multi-billion dollar 
giant; to now want to make even more money off the 
poor masses is unwarranted. Some Coca-Cola execu-
tives have offered the excuse that selling soda in the 
grocery store has become much less lucrative in 
recent years because of soft drink price wars. So. 
while we are able to buy a six-pack of Coke for 99¢ 
at the supermarket, we have to pay upwards of $2 for 
one can through a vending machine - all because 
the weather is warmer. 

The average consumer will probably be smart 
enough to pass up these jacked-up vending machine 
prices and buy a six-pack at the store. Or. they may 
just switch to Pepsi. Either way. Coca-Cola's iii-con-
ceived plan is doomed to fail.

MILLENIUM MYTHS 

COMMENTARY: The 
end of the world is not 
near, despite alannists 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Contributing Writer 

Earthquakes. Volcanic eruptions. 
Meteorites falling from the sky. Mystic 
conjunctions. Prophets seeing battles 
between nations as warning signs of 
Armageddon. The Archbishop of 
York warns, 'This world is in haste 
and the end approaches," proclaiming 
that the Antichrist has already come .. 

Dire warnings about the approach 
of the millennium - the first millen-
nium. The Archbishop Wulfstan 
wrote those words in the late 99Os. 

Compare this to today's apocalyp-
tic visions: Y2K "survivalists" stock-
pile food, water, precious metals and 
guns, build shelters in the woods for 
protection against marauding bands 
of starving neighbors, quote 
Nostradamus and excerpts from 
Revelations and expect the millenni-
um bug to cause everything from 
worldwide blackouts to airplanes 
falling from the sky, elevator crashes 
to pacemaker failures and randomly 
fired nuclear missiles to toaster, ATM 
and microwave malfunctions. 

Those experts who know what 
they're talking about draw parallels 
between Y2K and EI Nino: The year 
2000 will cause some real problems 
and people will use it as an excuse, 
but it won't cause The End Of The 
World As We Know It. More than 
likely, the actions of panicked people 

will cause greater damage than a few 
isolated computer crashes. Too many 
bank runs by people afraid of record 
loss and recession may send the 
nation into a depression regardless 
of any technical J'roblems. Food 
hoarding could lea to shortages. 

But the survivalists argue that the 
rest of us will be sorry when they're 
proven right. 

"It's absolutely prudent to try to 
get to a remote location," says D. Scott 
Secor, computer consultant for 1Win 
Cities Corporations. These people for-
get, however, that those in rural areas 
are the last ones to get help. 

Stephen D. O'leary, an associate 
professor at USC, says that this is 
expected human behavior. He 
explains that we like to "imagine 
ourselves as Rambo or Mother 
Theresa. Peofle look forward to 
times of socia chaos, because it's a 
time to be heroic and come together." 

I, for one, would be perfectly 
happy if people came together in less 
dangerous circumstances. The Y2K 
problem seems to be depleting the 
national reserves of common sense. In 
actuality, all of San Diego Gas and 
Electric (SDG&E),s year 2(XXJ mi'lSion 
critical systems work was finished by 
June 30. Airplanes, elevators, pace-
makers, toasters, and microwaves 
couldn't care less about what the date 
is. Errors in nuclear missile systems 
would cause the weapons to shut 
down, not to instigate accidental 
launches. In the worst case scenario, 
San Diegans might experience isolat-
ed blackouts lasting no longer than 
power outages in the past. In the 
event that something goes hOrribly 

wrong, S\JG&E will have an 
Emergency Operating Center open 
from December 31 on to facilitate 
qUick response. 

The only programs affected by this 
bug are those directly concernecf with 
dates or with computers that depend 
on dates, such as accoun=and 
billing systems. Don't get your 
up, though; the IRS is nearly . . 
with their critical work and plans to 
carry out processing manua]y if it 
becomes necessary. 

Some doomsayers, like Gary 
North, predict a "dOmino effect" that 
will cripple the nation's computer net-
works. More realistica11v, the Internet 
will still work even if a few of its 
strands are tangled.. Major corpora-
tions .and goverrunents are currently 
working out the kinks. California 
Governor Gray Davis issued an exec-
utive order making year 2(XX) issues 
the state's top ted\nOlogical priority, 
superseding all non-mandatory needs 
until June ~, 2OOl.

over from Halloween, but that's 
an entirely different story. The 
reason I committed a sin is 
because I violated the Uniform 
Tune Act of 1966. I'm actually 
kind of worried, because if I for-
get to repent and thus get hit by a 
campus shuttle tomorrow, I could 
burn in everlasting hell due to 
outstanding sins. 

Surprisingly, forgetting to set 
my watch back isn't the first 
thing that comes to mind when I 
think of an outstanding sin. The 
first thing that pops to mind is 
having sex with a drunk, under-
agt: elephant while murdering 
my parents and shoplifting from 
the UCSD Bookstore. Now 
there's an outstanding sin. 

Now, I'm not saying we 
should start running red lights 
and robbing convenience stores. 
There's a reason some things in 
life are illegal. But that .doesn't 
mean you can't start with some-
thing small in the privacy of your 
own home. Uke bootlegging con-
certs or smoking pot. These are 
victimless crimes; unless you 
consider yourself a victim ... but 
when was the last time you heard 
of a happy victim?

OPINION 5 

Student Regent Wanted 
COMMENTARY: One-year position available 
By MICHELLE PAN NOR 
Special to the Guardian 

Do you have ideas about how 
the budget of the University of 
California should be allocated? 
Have you ever wondered how the 
UC appoints chancellors? If you'd 
like to have an impact on policy at 
the University of California, I 
encourage you to apply to be the 
26th student regent. Out of the 26 
regents, there is one student regent 
who serves a one-year term. 

The student regent is expected 
to be aware of and understand 
issues on all of the UC campuses 
and to look at issues from a broad 
range of perspectives, not just a 
student perspective. However, 
because the student regent is the 
only regent who is a current stu-
dent, this person is also expected to 
bring a student's perspective to the 
table and to voice student needs. 

The duties of the student regent 
include serving on several of the 
seven standing committees. I am 
currently on the finance, educa-
tional policy, and grounds and 
buildings committees, but commit-
tee membership differs for each 
student regent from year to year. 
There are also additional task 
forces and other committees that 
some regents also work on. For 
example, I am a member of the 
Outreach Advisory Board for the 
UC and I also attend the meetings 
of the UC Students' Assoc.iation. 

In addition to the Regents' 
meetings, there are other activities 
that I have engaged in as the stu-
dent regent. Since my term began 
in March, I have made numerous 
public speeches and have been a 
panelist at conferences. I have also 

hosted forums on diversity and the 
UC budget, ilnd I will host a sym-
posium to commemorate the stu-
dent regent position in spring. I 
have also written articles for all of 
the UC campus newspapers to 
help keep students informed and 
to get student input. Each student 
regent has engaged in different 
activities. 

There are no official require-
ments except that you must be a 
UC student during your full term. 
Since the position was created 25 
years ago, no two student regents 
have had the same background. 

I would encourage any students 
interested in the position to famil-
iarize themselves with the major 
issues of concern on all of the cam-
puses; visit all of the campus web-
sites; call the student government 
officers; speak with your campus 
administrators, staff and faculty; 
explore the UC website at 
htlp://www.ucop.edll; read the 
Master Plan of Higher Education; 
get to know the history of the UC; 
brainstorm ways that we can solve 
current and future higher-educa-
tion policy issues. 

The process of applying to be 
the next student regent begins 
with filling out the application. 
You can do this online at http:// 
www.llcop.edll/regents If you are 
from northern California, your 
application will be sent to the 
southern California President's 
Commission who will sort 
through the applicatiOns - the 
southern California applications 
are sent to the northern California 
commission. Th~ next step is an 
interview with the President's

6 OPINION 

MYTHS: 
Fanatics pose larger 
risk than computers 
ContInued fronI ..,. 4 
thankfully set off computers by 
only a day. According to the 
Gregorian calendar, which most 
industrialized nations follow, 
years divisible by 100 are not leap 
years unless they are also divisi· 
ble by 400, which 2!XXl definitely 
is (by 5, you non-math/science 
majors). So, next year is a leap 
year. If anyone tells you other-
wise, look it up in the encyclope-
dia and prove it to them. 

It's not as if computer crashes 
are anything new. Neither are 
date-based problems. The fiscal 
year of 2!XXl began on April 1, 
1999 in New York without undue 
disruption of the stock market or 
state government. California's fis-
cal year began on July 1, 1999 with 
little fanfare. Global Positioning 
Systems such as those used by the 
military and the private sector 
had their turnover on August 22( 
1999. The Intemet is full of years-
old prophecy of financial ruin on 
these dates. Something terrible 
might have happened - if no one 
had taken the initiative to fix these 
problems and retain their valu-
able business. About the only 

problems in the news so far are 
computers with difficulty pro-
cessing credit cards with expira-
tion dates in the year 2!XXl and 
Maine's Department of Motor 
Vehicles, which registered all year 
2!XXl cars as "horseless carriages." 

In addition to Armageddon-
spouting, blow-

crackpot theories. These explain 
the origin of the Y2K bug in irra-
tional terms: It's a government 
conspiracy; aliens implanted it in 
our computers Ie make us their 
slaves; it's an inevitable conse-
quence of the prophecies of 
Nostradamus and the Bible. One 

gun-selling web-
sites, the Internet 
contains stories of 
people stockpiling 
Pez candy dis-
pensers, a pletho-
ra of Y2K cartoons 
and plenty of Y2K 
commercia !ism. 
People are selling 
Y2K countdown 
clocks, hundreds 
of books, stuffed 
"millennium bug" 
toys, survival kits 
with items such as 
utility knives, 
compasses, Post-It 

About the only prob-
lems in the news so 
far are computers 
with difficulty process-
ing credit cards with 
expiration dates in the 
year 2000 and 
Maine's Department 
of Motor Vehicles, 
which registered all 
year 2000 cars as 
"horseless carriages." 

thing they don't 
teU you about the 
prophecies is the 
context. In the first 
place, if the Bible 
gave an exact date 
for the end of the 
world - or even 
the beginning of 
the world, for that 
matter - there 
wouldn't be the 
controversy that 
has been going on 
for millennia. 
Also, the literal 
translation of 
Nostradamus' 

notes, T-shirts, squishable stress-
relievers, abacuses, flashlights 
and dice for predicting equipment 
failures. There's even a Y2K bug 
spray that promises to be "a solu-
tion" (i.e., liquid) to all your Y2K 
problems. It's a wonder they 
don't make prophetic Magic Y2K 
Balls. 

Mixed in among the humor are 
the almost-indistinguishable 

Quatrain 72 from 
Century X reads: 

"In the year 1999 and seven 
months,! From the skies shall 
come an alarmingly powerful 
king,/ To raise again the great 
King of the Jacquerie,! Before and 
after, Mars shall reign at will." 

I don't know about r.0u, but I 
haven't seen this 'King of . 
Jacquerie" guy around any-
where, which is strange since 

Orthodontics 

he's supposed to have come here 
around July. 

Beyond the traditianal wam-
ings, there are some even more on 
the fringe, such as Jim Bttkker's 
prediction that a'l asteroid will hit 
Earth on January 1 and block out 
the sun or the concern that 
President Clinton 'will declare 
martial law so he can remain in 
power for four more years (only 
to remain gridlocked with the 
Republican Congress. no doubt). 

So, we won't be too affected by 
the minor computer glitches, and 
the people buying huge plots of 
land will have nice places for 
vacation homes in the next millen-
nium. It's the crazed cultists I'm 
worried about: Those that predict 
the destruction of the world and 
the Second Coming of whatever 
deity they worship. Those that 
will be disappointed on January 1, 
2(XX) when the world continues as 
it always has upon the arbitrary 
time intervals of humanity. Those 
who will feel the need to rectify 
such celestial oversight by taking 
it upon themselves to kill their fel-
low men. Thankfully, that's only a 
select few. 

Take a lesson from the last mil-
lennium and don't let yourself be 
one of the Y2K alarmists. Or, if 
you're considering it, at least con-
sult your Magic Y2K ball first.

China Not Expected to Let Up In Gong Case IRAQ: 
Resolutions called for 
lifting of sanctions 

"Nothing in Iraq has anything 
to do with prohibited weapons," 
he said. 

BEIJING - Has it come to 
this: that the Chinese Communist 
Party is terrified of retirees in ten-
nis shoes who follow a spiritual 
master in New York? 

So it has almost seemed here 
during recent days of bizarre 
arrests and flying ' invective 
against the Falun Gong move-
ment. 

As security forces worked 
frantically to pick up believers 
who converged on Beijing to 
plead Falun Gong's case, the 
government left no doubt that it 
intends to wipe out all organized 
traces of the movement - even 
if that requires jailing thousands 
of people who never considered 
themselves enemies of the state. 

Behind closed doors in recent 
weeks, many Chinese, from pro-
fessors to cab drivers, have said 
the government has overreacted. 
Many say its blunt repression of a 
spiritual movement that attracted 
hordes of ordinary people seek-
ing health and happiness will 
cause lasting social divisions and 
further erode faith in the party. 

But many analysts say that 
even so, China's Communist 
leaders probably saw little 

choice. Their first principle is 
preserving the rule of the party, 
which they equate with protect-
ing social stability. And they 
have consistently tried to stamp 
out any competing loyalties.

Drug Trafficking Bill 
Caught in Lobbying Battle 

WASHINGTON - Efforts by 
the Republican chairman of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee to 
soften a bill that would expand 
economic sanctions against drug 
traffickers and the businesses that 
work with them has touched off a 
furious dispute on Capitol Hill. 

His aides say that the chair-
man, Sen. Richard Shelby of 
Alabama, is merely trying to fi x 
flawed legislation that might 
allow overzealous government 
officials to seize the assets of legit-
imate companies tied to drug 
trafficking by scant evidence . 

But some of Shelby's fellow 
Republicans have taken unusual-
ly vehement exception to his 
stance, suggesting that opponents 
of the law have been influenced 
by Washington lobbyists working 
for companies that might be 
affected by the legislation. 

" We have discovered in this 
Congress that we are not insulated 
by the efforts of the kingpins to buy 
influence and corrupt our political 
institutions," Rep. Bill Mctollum, 
R-Fla., a Republican member of the

The verdict, which came after 
10 hours of deliberations over 
two days, brought a swift end to 
a case that has been watched 
closely because of the brutality 
of the crime and the sexual ori-
entation of the victim, Matthew 
Shepard, a 21-year-old political 
science student. He was found 
on Oct. 7, 1998, unconscious and 
tied to a fence on the prairie out-
side Laramie. He was taken to a' 
hospital with severe head 
wounds, and died five days 
later. 

A second defendant, Russell 
Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty 
last spring and is serving a life 
sentence in prison without possi-
bility of parole.

on the floor shortly before the 1egis-

The legislation has run into 
trouble in the Senate where 
Shelby and a few of his col-
leagues, including the 
Democratic vice chairman of the 
intelligence panel, Bob Kerrey of 
Nebraska, have raised objections. 

Aides to Shelby said he would 
like to see the bill amended so 
that potential targets of the law 
would have strong protections. 
Assets could not be seized with-
out a legal finding that the com-
panies were deliberately involved 
in the drug trade. Shelby, aides 
said, also wants provisions that 
~uld protect the assets of owners 
or subsidiaries of drug-trafficking 
firms which are not themselves 
connected to the drug trade.

In the months since the ban,

Government Sues Companies 
WASHINGTON - The fed-

eral government sued seven 
giant electric companies in the 
Midwest and the South on 
Wednesday, accusing the utili-
ties of defying anti-pollution 
regulations and illegafiy conta-
minating the air breathed by 
millions of Americans. 

The government took action 
against 32 coal-fired flants in 10 
states, saying that i the plants 
reduced pollution as required it 
would have the same effect as 
taking 26 million cars off the road. 

The government accused the 
companies of modernizing their 
generating plants without mod-
ernizing their pollution controls 
as required by the Clean Air Act, 
which exempts many old power 
plants from the law's toughest 
requ irements. 

The Justice Department filed 
the lawsuits on behalf of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
The govemment contends that 17 
power plants run by the compa-
nies have fouled the atmosphere 
for years and have contributed "to 
some of the most severe environ-

mental problems facing the 
United States today." 

"When children have trouble 
breathing because of pollution 
from a utility plant hundreds of 
miles away, something must be 
done," Attorney General Janet 
Reno said. The civil suits, which 
seek to fine the companies and 
force them to install modern 
anti-pollution equipment, were 
filed in U.S. District Court in fi ve 
Midwestem and Southern ci ties. 

The EPA administrator, Carol 
Browner, said the seven defen-
dants had committed "very, very 
Significant violations of the Clean 
Air Act," an accusation that the 
utilities immediately denounced. 

Browner said the companies 
had illegally retooled old, pollu-
tion-spewing coal plants with-
out notifying regulators, getting 
the necessary permits and 
installing expensive new equip-
ment to reduce emissions and 
meet pollution standards that 
apply to new plants. 

"They chose not to," Browner 
said, "because they knew that if 
they did they'd have to reduce 

their pollution, and they didn't 
want to do it." 

The utilities' motive, she 
added, was to prolong the lives 
of the old plants and to avoid the 
cost of build ing new plants 
because of the tough, modern 
standards. 

The defendants denou nced 
the government's action . "We 
regret that the agency has again 
demonstrated that it prefers 
headlines and confrontation 
over consensus-building," said 
Dale Heydlauff, a vice presidenl 
of American Electric Power of 
Colu mbus, Ohio. "We are full y 
prepared to vigorously defend 
againstlhese allegations, and we 
believe we will prevail." 

Besides American Elect ric 
Power, the defendants in the fed-
eral suits are Cinergy of 
Cincinnati; FirstEnergy of 
Akron, Ohio; Illinois Power; 
Southern India na Gas and 
Electric Co.; Southern Company, 
based in Atlanta, and the Ta mpa 
Electric Co. of Florida.

Bacteria Cases in Denmark Cause 
Antibiotics Concerns in the United St~tes 

An outbreak of severe, drug-
resistant salmonella infections in 
27 people in Denmark, traced to 
meat from infected pigs, is being 
described by American scientists 
as a warning on what could hap-
pen in the United States unless 
steps are taken to limit the use of 
antibiotics in farm animals. 

The episode in Denmark, in 
which 11 people were hospital-
ized and two of them died, is 
especially worrisome because 
the bacteria had made them 
partly resistant to a class of 
antibiotics called f1uoro-
quinolones that doctors had 
considered one of their most 
powerful weapons against 
severe cases of salmonella and 
other bacteria that infect the 
intestinal tract. If those bacteria 
invade the bloodstream, which 
occurs in 3 percent to 10 percent 
of salmonella cases, the illness 

www.ucsdguardian.org 

can be fatal. 
"Fluoroquinolones become a 

drug of last resort for some of 
these infections," said Dr. Stuart 
Levy, director of the Center for 
Adaptation Genetics and Drug 
Resistance at Tufts University. 
"If we're beginning to lose these 
drugs, where do we go from 
here?" 

Fluoroquinolones are the 
most recently approved class of 
antibiotics; nothing comparable 
is expected to become available 
for several years. 

Salmonella that are resistant 
to fluoroquinolones have not 
been detected in the United 
States although they have 
turned up in Britain, France and 
Germany, as well as Denmark. 
But, "resistance is a global 
issue," said Dr. Stephen F. 
Sundlof, director of the center 
for veterinary medicine at the _ 

Food and Drug Administration, 
which regulates the use of 
antibiotics in livestock and poul-
try. 

"It potentially has an impact 
on everybody because of the 
global nature of trade in food-
stuffs, or people carrying organ-
isms into other countries," 
Sundlof said. 

Fluoroquinolones are used in 
Denmark to treat some illnesses 
in pigs, and the Danish 
researchers who studied the out-
break suggested that such use 
might have fostered the growth 
of resistant bacteria, which then 
entered the food supply. The 
outbreak, which occurred last 
year, is being reported Thursday 
in Tile New England Journal of 
Medicine.

that it may be released with each 
heartbeat. Hormones such as 
adrenaline release this break and 
cause the heart rate to increase. In 
cases of heart failure, the balance 
between the brake and the accel-
erator is disrupted. 

After injuries or abnormalities 
caused by a heart attack or genetic 
defect, the PLB works extra hard, 
restricting the proper amount of 
calcium from being released and 
weakening the heart function . 

Chien and his colleagues have 
used a variety of advanced med-
ical techniques to determine the 
significance of calcium-cycling 
defects in cases of heart failure. By 
genetically engineering a mouse 
that is prone to develop heart fail-
ure, and cross-breeding it with a 
mouse that lacks the PLB gene, 
they have created offspring that 
display no signs of heart failure.

In order to test if the lack of the

using a "viral vector," they put the 
mutated PLB gene into heart-mus-

genetically engineered mouse. 

Chien said that the new mouse 
"rescues itself" from heart failure. 

He added that the research on 
mice will soon lead to gene thera-

"We've designed a mutant 
gene that inhibits its normal coun-

it inhibits itself. This variant gene 
is a potential therapeutic agent 
and opens the door for gene ther-

"Ironically, heart failure is 
increasing as a result of our suc-
cess in treating other heart prob-
lems such as heart attacks," 
Chien said. "Advances in cardiac 
care are resulting in more people 
surviving heart attacks, but dam-
age to the heart muscle from the 
attack places patients at high risk 
for developing heart failure." 

Nancy Stringer, a spokesper-

within time the research may 
move to bigger animals and 
eventually to humans.

of these advances may come in 
the form of the development of

Currently, the treatment revolves 
around medicine that is designed 
to increase the heart's pumping

How 'Sweet' It 
, 

Final play of the season 
falls short of greatness 
despite an impressive 

effort by the cast 

Tennessee Williams' "Sweet Bird of Youth" has different meaning for stu-dents than it has for older audience members. The play is a lamentation on 
the loss of youth, potential and innocence. 

For those of you looking for a feel-
good, pick-me-up show, keep looking. 
Plays written by Tennessee Williams are 
not noted for their heartwarming story-
lines. Poignant, moving and thought-pro-
voking, maybe. But don't go there looking 
for a good time. 

Students who are contemplating enter-
ing the working world, accompanied by 
mortgages, responsibilities and commit-
ments may find a particularly poignant 
message behind "Sweet Bird of Youth." 
Williams appeals to people not to waste 
their youthful energy as well as not to 
depend too much on its waning vitality. 

The play has a strong message and a 
provocative storyline. The directing is 
poor, however, due to the fact that the 
actors fail to work well together in the 
overall presentation of the story. 

The scene changes and cast are remark-
able, however. Aside from the weaknesses 
in direction, the play is worth seeing. 

The play focuses on Chance Wayne, 
played by Patrick Wilson, and his return 
to St. Cloud, a town on the Gulf Coast. His 
ambition is to become a movie star, but he 
works as a hustler while his youth, confi-
dence and beauty fade. 

Chance is there to confront his demons 
and the challenges that present them-
selves due to his sexual relationship with 
Heavenly Finley, played by Elizabeth 
Reaser. Their sexual relationship and his 
promiscuity led to her to contract a sexu-
ally transmitted disease that resulted in a 
hysterectomy. She is the daughter of Boss 
Finley, a powerful and strongly racist 
leader of the community who exploits 
"God's Will" to motivate the community 
in following him. 

Chance returns to the wrath of Boss 
Finley, played by M. Emmet Walsh, who 
wants revenge for his daughter 'S loss of 
innocence. Much like the biblical stories 
he preaches, Finley demands an eye for an 
eye, to take Chance's vitality and man-
hood, and strip him of all opportunities 
for success. 

Boss Finley holds his daughter up as an 
example of white southern purity that must 
be protected from "black contamination." 
He confronts his opposition with a mob-

Getting Into John Malkovich's Head 
Director Spike Jonze's 13eingJohn Malkovich' blends hamor and fantasy in an irresistable package 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Reviewing movies is like 
searching for the Holy Grail: You 
ha ve to plod through thickets of 
frustrating, disappointing nicks 
in hopes of setting your sights on 
something you aren't even sure 
really exists. Well, "Being John 
Malkovich" is your ticket to the 
holy land. 

Part adult fable, part twisted 
love story, the brilliant "Being 
John Malkovich" finds down-
and-out puppeteer Craig (a 
scruffy John Cusack) urged by 
his wife Lotte (an equally 
scruffy Ca meron Diaz) to get a 
job. Thinking that his lightning-
fast puppeteering fingers may 
come in hand y in filing work, he 
reluctantly gets hired on the 
eventh-and-a-half floor by a 

nondescript company where all 
the employees have to duck to 
avoid hitting their heads on the 
ceiling. 

Here, Craig finds a portal 
behind a file cabmet that allows 
him to climb into John 
Malkovich's head for 15 minutes 
at a time, after which he is 
dumped out next to the New Jer-
sey Tu rnpike. Giddy at his dis-
covery, he lets his wife try the life-
changing experience. She, how-
ever, becomes addicted to being 
inside a man. 

If the portal is a drug, then 
these characters are hooked on 
Malkovich. 

To make things more compli-
cated, Lotte falls in love with 
Maxine (Catherine Keener), the 
coworker of Craig's dreams. 
Maxine falls in love with Lotte 
too, but only while Lotte is inside 
Malkovich. Craig, who wants to 
be wi th Maxine more than any-
thing, locks his wife ur in a cage 
to take advantage 0 Maxine's

desire to be with Lotte. Once 
inside, he figures out how to stay 
there. Suddenly, he is 
Malkovich's puppeteer. Got it? 

Although the catch is that pe0-
ple can actually be Malkovicll for 
15 minutes at a time, the movie 
spends a good portion of its plot 
allowing Craig to mesh with var-
ious personalities: the horny 
hard-of-hearing secretary Floris; 
the sexy, manipulative coworker 

Maxine, who suggests charging 
$200 a pop for the public to jour-
ney inside the portal. 

The result is a funny' screw-
ball comedy that doesn t rely on 
a gimmick. Instead, the portal 
seems as natural as, say, the 
senile boss who doesn't think 
anybody can understand his 
clear speech. Or, the lady who 
hits the emergency-stop button 
on the elevator when it passes 

between the seventh and eighth somebody else inside of our 
floors so that she can crowbar the heads manning the vessel? These 
door and allow the employees are some of the questions the film 
out. Consequently, "Being John poses; but not to worry, it never

River North Dance Delights UCSD 
Weekend audiences took a break from goals and goblins to enjoy an inspiring dance peiformance 
By HANNAH GRIFFITH 
Staffwnter 

There was no Halloween 
event at the Mandeville Audito-
rium this weekend, but for Sat-
urday night's audience, there 
were no disappointments. The 
touring Chicago jazz company 
River North Dance was not oth-
erworldly, but it was vivacious 
and exciting. While it is normal 
for jazz dance to be lively, this 
company does not stop there. Its 
repertory pushes the limits of 
what is considered to be jazz 
dance, with pieces that run the 
gamut from energetic and sexy 
to satirical, slow and romantic, 
hyperactive or literary. 

Interesting music choices at 
Saturday night's performance 
added to this diversity by giving 
another dimension to what 
would otherwise be typical 
pieces. The prime examr,le of 
this was "Lean on Me. ' The 
gospel influence of the music 
added flavor and feeling to the 
exuberant choreography; with 
different music, the piece would 
have been less effective. 

The closest the performance 
came to any type of "haunting" 
quality was the second act open-
er, a meditative piece called 
"Temporal Trance.' The lights 
came up slowly to reveal -
barely - two couples dancing 

slowly and smoothly through a 
series of low-level poses-in-
motion. Their muscles gleamed 
green, highlighted in the dim 
light like drawings from a high-
quality comic book. 

The men spent much of the 
time sitting or lying on the 
ground, with the female partners 
above them. Definitely not "lifts" 
in the classical sense, which were 
used elsewhere, such as in "Fixe," 
these weight-bearing exercises 
were slow but dynamic and 
revealed a series of fascinating 
images. This choreography, by co-
artistic director Frank Chaves, 
provided some of the calmest yet 
most intriguing movements of 
the whole performance. 

During these simultaneous 
duets, three other dancers 
remained immobile and barely 
visible against the black curtain 
at the back of the sta§e. Por the 
second part of 'Temporal 
Trance," the music changed and 
the curtain slid open to reveal a 
white-bluish scrim, whose 
smooth, light presence gave a 
sense of space and distance to 
the stage More than any other 
piece - and ironically, since its 
name evokes a place in time -
the second part of "Temporal 
Trance" effectively created a 
space for the dance in the imagi-
nations of the viewers. 

The dancers came in and out 

The closest the 
performance came to any 
type of "haunting" quality 
was the opener for the 
second act, a meditative 
piece called "Temporal

smoothly through a series 
of low-level poses-in-
motion. 

of a circle or moved in canon in 
meditative movement reminis-
cent of some sort of ritual. With 
the dancers now glowing golden 
against blue, the colors of this 

second part of the dance evoked 
images of early morning or twi-
light in a sacred place. 

On a completely different 
theme, "Wired" cleverly illustrat-
ed both that hyperactive state of 
being and the idea of being wired 
into mass communication. Two 
male dancers in swim caps and 
old-fashioned swimsuits jiggled 
around the stage with an irre-
pressible energy that hooked the 
audience. They performed to a 
musical collage by choreogra-
phers Sam Watson and Kenny 
Comstock that resembled the 
sound of someone channel surf-
ing; the movement seemed con-
trolled by the music. 

"Wired" was lit by a single 
work-lamp brought onstage by 
the dancers. For the beginning 
and end, they placed it on the 
ground downstage left and sat 
right in front of it, chest to chest 
with arms and legs tangled 
around each other like lovers. 
Their movement, however, was 
far from romantic; they jiggled 
as if ther were plagued by an 
excess 0 energy and had only 
each other to keer themselves-
somewhat - stil . 

At one point the dancers used 
the lamp to keep the dance 
going without moving: one 
posed in the center of the stage, 
while the other, downstage, 
bounced the lamp up and down 

so that the shadow of the first 
jumped around on the back wall . 
By literally inflating the visual 
impression beyond the body of 
the dancer, this ingenious trick 
perfectly captured perfectly the 
feeling of overflowing energy, 
and was an instant crowd-pleas-
er. 

The closing piece, "Mission," 
was the longest. Co-choreo-
graphed by both Chaves and the 
other artistic director, Sherry 
Zunker Dow, the dance was 
divided into six sections, each 
inspired by different quotes 
found in the program. This extra 
layer forced the spectators to 
think a little harder about the 
dance for themselves - as 
opposed to having its meaning 
spelled out for them, as it was in 
"Stroller Derby," a satire about 
maternal over-achievement and 
female frustration that appeared 
second on the program. 

At the end of "Mission," there 
was no final , climactic pose. 
Instead, the curtain closed as the 
entire company danced with 
undiminished enthusiasm, as if 
oblivious to the fact that they 
were being cut off from the audi-
ence. This image captured a feel-
ing of joy that pervaded the 
entire evening: "Audience?" the 
dancers seemed to be saying. 
"We're dancing because we love 
to, because it's in us."

The Distance To Here 

Radloactlv. Record. 

-*** 
There are a few constants in 

this world: The Cubs will break 
the hearts of their fans, UCSD stu-
dents will be doomed to study 
into the wee hou rs of the morning 
and Live will sell millions of 
albums every time they release a 
new one. 

Back in 1991 Live released 
thei r debu t Mell fal }l'welry, but it 
wasn' t unt il 1994's lO-mill ion-
plus selling Throwing Copper tha t 
the group went rrom "just a 
band" to a musical phenomenon. 
"lightnIng Crashes," arguably 
one of the best rock songs of the 
decade, seemed to be on the radio 
every hour all the way through 
the summer of '96. The album 
also landed lead si nger Ed 
Kowalczyk and crew onto "Sa tur-
day Night Live" and forever into 
popular culture. So, after 1997's 
disappoint ing Secre f Samadhi, 
w hich managed to sell only a few 
million albums, the band had 
work cut out for them In 1999. 

Live seems to hit big on their 
even-numbered albums, and the 
fourth time is the charm with The 
Distallce fa Here. Released on Oct. 
5, this album is inspired from 
beginning to end. Melodies like 
"Sparkle," "Run to the Water" 
and "Dance With You " make The 
Distallce to Here a good album, but 
it is standout tracks like "The 
Dolphin's Cry" and the tremen-

• 
--

dously catchy "They Stood Up for 
Love' that make it a grea t a lbum. 

"The message of the new 
a lbum is no secret," Kowa lcyck 
stated. "It is a message of love 
and an invita tion to myself and 
those who want to come a long to 
ask the big questions and not feel 
uncool do ing it." 

The Distance to Here is just the 
a lbum for the UCSD student who 
needs something to help them go 
the "distance" and study into the 
wee hou rs of the morning.

Queensryclle 
Q2K A __ 

-***; 
The arriva l of Q2K s ignals 

another decade of inspiring 
music from Queensryche. Thrust 
into mainstream popularity with 
the early '90s hit "Silent Lucidi-
ty," Queensryche nevertheless 
remained true to its hard-rock 
roots. Q2K may not have tremen-
dous crossover potential, but it 
reestablishes Queensryche's seat 
upon the throne of rock ' n roll . 

Queensryche's new album, 
which they produced in Seattle, 
has everything a modern rock 
album should: stellar guitar, 
haunting vocals and universally 
painful lyriCS. Furthermore, 
despite the traditionally angst-
ridden moans that any teenager 
can identify with, Q2K is a sur-
prisingly sophisticated work of 
a rt.

·P..tners': Abel and Zed vie for the affections of a beautiful 
struggling actress in Gregg Araki's screwball comedy "Splendor.· 

Three's A Crowd 
Gregg Araki's 'Splendor' splurges on style 
but skimps on reality 
By JEREMY GftAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ah, the threesome. The for-
bidden romance that "Three's 
Company" once hinted at and 
the aptly named movie "Three-
some" bludgeoned us over the 
head with, has now come full 
circle with Gregg Araki' s 
newest flick "Splendor." The 
film explores the taboo with a 
twist: it makes it seem natural. 
Or, maybe it makes it seem a lit-
tle too natural. 

Veronica (Kathleen Robert-
son) meets not one but two men 
of her dreams. Abel Gohnathon 
Schaech) satisfies her humble, 
artsy side, and Zed (Matt 
Keeslar) satisfies her need to 
make hot, steamy monkey love 
on the floor of a bathroom. Of 
course, all three of them are 
pretty; Every actor in the movie 
seems like they were lured 
away from some Aaron Spelling 
audition. 

Araki ("The Doom Genera-
tion" and "Nowhere") has 
always delivered style and con-
troversy in his explorations of 
the social side of Los Angeles. 
"Splendor" definitely doesn' t 
skimp on such style - every 
scene is aglow with blues and 
pinks, and Veronica's first date 
with Abel even features video 
headshots of the date projected 
on a wall behind the character 
in the frame. Classy. 

Alas, style does not make a 
movie, and it is amazing how 
Araki holds back on the contro-
versy. In fact, he makes a three-
some look downright conserva-
tive. Sure, the idea is to root for 
Abel and Zed when temptation 
in the form of a movie director 
sweeps Veronica away from 
their happy home, but there is 
never any sense of deviance 
other than Veronica's confession 
that her relationship is far from

ALBUMS: 
Previous albums

CoiIII Hed".. ..... 12 
appease their foray of fans with 
There's Nothing Left To Lose, an 
album completely recorded in 
the basement of Grohl's home in 
Virginia, far from the pressures 
of recording studios and pro-
ducers. 

Grohl, accomplanied by 
bassist Nate Mendel and drum-
mer Taylor Hawkins, kept the 
same sound that fans have been 
longing for but without the grit-
ty attitude and ferocity that 
gave flavor to previous record-
ings such as "Monkey Wrench." 
The sound intensity is there, but 
the attitude is waivering. 

The removed environment of 
Grohl's basement is evident in 
the relaxed album. Although 
they do start off with the won-
derfully violent "Stacked 
Actors," filled to the brim with 
Foo Fighters' characteristic 
wall-of-guitar sound, the band 
quickly moves into the energetic 
but seemingly flip "Breakout," 
and beyond. 

The album starts to teeter on 

the brink of a light-hearted, 
pop-rock wash, apparently 
sucking the energy from cookie-
cutter drumming and mostly 
uninspired lead guitar. 

There's Nothing Left To Lose, 
with its occasionally poetic 
lyrics, maintains an even keel of 
energy with its instrumenta-
tion, never venturing out into 
rougher territory or slowing it 
down for more personal bal-
lads. Songs like "Gimmie 
Stitches" with its lyrical 
imagery, bounces along ineffec-
tively with half-assed energy 
and vocals. "Head wires" is pro-
pelled by light '80s rhythms 
and begins to spark in the 
fueled chorus (Better thlln a bul-
let being fired / Tangled in your 
headwires), but falls short in dri-
ving the entire song. 

With only adequate energy 
and lacking in inspiration, 
There's Nothing uft To Lose boils 
down to some wonderfully 
mixed sounds without the atti-
tude of previous efforts. The 
Colour and The Shllpe is a hard 
album to follow, with exhaust-
ing fury and beautiful inter-
ludes. There's Nothing Left To 
Lose feels like Foo Fiidlters are 
simply catching their 6reath.

Spike Jonze's skill as a director

Every minute, every second 
of "Being John Malkovich" is 
genius. Some will appreciate it 
for the sharp, comic dialogue

admire the dark undertones and 
social commentary. And then 
there are the chosen few who

a beautiful, seamless package of

"Being John Malkovich" is as

like mentality, ordering his follow-
ers, including his son, to castrate 
enemies, including Chance. 

Coupled with this situation is _ 
the fact that Chance is traveling 
with Alexandra del Lago a.k.a . 
the Princess Kosmonopolis, 
played by Pamela Payton-Wright. 
He takes care of her, and attempts 
to exploit her fame as a movie 
actress to promote his own career, 
so he can take Heavenly to Cali-
fornia with him. She too, is con-
fronting her own loss of youth as 
an actress. 

The UCSD Guardian 

This play is most famous for the 
1962 movie that starred Paul New-
man as Chance and Geraldine 
Page as Princess Kosrnonopolis. 

"Sweet Bird of Youth" is more 
than just the final production of 
La Jolla Playhouse's 1999 season; 
it is also the final selection of 
Michael Grief, Artistic Director 
for the Playhouse for the past five 
years. The play seems to have

normal. 

Take away the real-life disdain 
for deviant relationships and all 
that is left is a hollow, egocentric 
woman who can' t be happy hav-
ing just one man. Oh, boo hoo. 

Even Veronica's bitchy les-
bian friend Michael ("Trainspot-
ting"'s Kelly MacDonald), who 
provides the gravity in her life, 
never does more than pronounce 
her disapproval, which is rooted 
in her utter disdajn of the male 
species. And, even that refresh-
ing bitchiness gives way to senti-
ment when she finally decides to 
help Veronica out of the hole she

has dug for herself. 
Perhaps it is commentary 

enough to say that the most believ-
able part of the movie is that it 
takes a combination of two shal-
low, one-dimensional people to 
make up one real person in the 
wading pool known as Los Ange-
les. Seeing Abel and Zed fret on the 
couch over the love of their lives 
makes it clear that this is no longer 
a threesome, it is a twosome. It just 
happens that half of the twosome 
is made up of two people. 

"Splendor" jumps on the Real 
World bandwagon as Veronica 
gives periodic confessionals as 
the story's narrator. This tech-
nique is getting old, and it only 
lends an extra-conservative 
aspect to the movie as a whole.

limits of societal acceptance?

It is nice to see a movie that

needed to worry less about slow, 
goofy stuttersteps in their pat-
terns and more about playing real 
football . The guy found this 
aspect of the opposing team's 
play amusing on this Friday after-
noon before Halloween. And then 
he showed up: They might have 
been slower, and more adept at 
succumbing to the trickery of Big 
Al on the line, but they did man-
age to find their seventh player. 

The guy rubbed his hands 
together during the first quarter, 
ran the threadbare ends of his 
cleats through the short grass and 
squatted down on the line to 
defend his team through the air. 
He wasn't about to allow the pre-
historic passing skills of the oppos-
ing quarterback damper his enthu-
siasm. But all that protection on 
the gridiron would not matter. 

The quarterback, who a week 
before this game was revered in 
the media, began a different trend 
in tenns of effort that afternoon.

The Tritons have been on a tear 
as of late, looking unbeatable aside 
from the match against Division-II 
opponent USD. The Tritons hope 
that the momentum carries them 
deer. into the piayoff5. 

, We've had a run - apart from 
the USD game - of seven or eight 
or nine wins," Armstrong said. 
"We're working on tightening it up 
a bit. We need to make up set plays 
and make sure they bear fruit." 

UCSD's season is not over. In 
fact, it has just begun for a team 
that wins when it needs to. 

The Tritons must now wait for 

yet, kept an open ear to the offen-
sive desires of his teammates. 
Thus spawned this season's gene-
sis of the Freeballers' short pass-
inggame. 

Unfortunately, the guy caMot 
survive the week without a smoke 
or two or seven. He would come to 
the sideline to catch his wheezing 
breath and got a clear look at tough 
catches, nice tight spirals and TDs 
by his teammates. One was made 
by his accomplice in the defensive 
backfield. The man ran a fabulous 
pattern, faking out his foe down 
field in lightning speed fashion for 
what the guy thought was the 
most well-executed play of the sea-
son. 

The running game was firing 
on all cylinders as well. The guy 
remembers blocking well, allow-
ing Len to scamper for a 6O-yard 
touchdown. The guy can recall: 
Sprint to get out there before he 
comes around the comer and get 
off the line as quick as possible on 
this sweep play. Ah, don't forget to 
keep your head up and square. No 
collision with the exception of 
your arms hitting his chest. No 
blood. We're in the clear. Go Lm! 
Touchdown baby. 

After that, he could sense that 
things were going to be all right on

the playoff pairings, to be 
released Sunday, which will 
decide their playoff fate. 

"We should know on Sunday," 
Armstrong said, more than 
pleased with his team's proposi-
tions. "The thinking is we'll get a 
Wednesday game." 

It is not yet certain whether 
their game will be at home or on 
the road. Look for preliminary 
infonnation on the Tritons' fate in 
Monday's edition of GlUlrdian. 

In the meantime, cross your 
fingers and pray for the playoffs. 

that Friday afternoon before 
Halloween. In fact, laughs were all 
right for this kind of a situation 
when the guy's team was about 
ready to rehearse for next week's 
game. Especially when the defen-
sive backs on his team start having 
a stupid and dangerous tendency 
to tip the ball in the air when it's 
thrown their way. 

"Knock it straight into the turf 
or go for the pick you dolts," said 
the guy. But the guy wasn't one to 
talk, for on one play he rotated his 
body into a full-on Willie Mays 
sprint to go for the ball and 
tipped it into the air. 

His colleague, who scored the 
touchdown on that beautiful pass 
right there to back him up. Poor 
play reared it's head again as the 
man ran straight past for the touch-
down and a misstep allowed his 
man to get away. The guy was so 
pissed when he caught it that he let 
the receiver take it in for the score. 

"No need to display catch-up 
speed here, Happy Halloween, 
here's your treat," the guy said. 

Stay tuned next week for the 
connection between the guy's 
experience and DBs of the NFL. 
Also, don't forget to come see the 
guy play on Friday. Hopefully his 
QB will pass well again.

should not consider all they 
gave up for Leaf. 

The man is an overgrown 
infant. In his latest tirade, Leaf 
decided he shouldn't have to go 
through the standard rehab that 
all athletes must face after an 
injury. In a fashion all his own, 
Leaf told the trainers, using most-
ly four letter f-bombs, that he was 
above this kind of manual work-
out. 

The Chargers, trying to cover 
up the behavior of their juvenile 
multi-millionaire, suspended 
Leaf for four games, sighting 
"conduct detrimental to the 
team." 

There is this thing in sports 
called chemistry (sorry guys but 
it is not at all like o-chem). After 
seeing the Yankees bull through 
the league the last four years, I 
now believe that a teams' out-
look and attitude can make a dif-
ference. 

Leaf is a chE'mistry inhibitor. 
He is horrible in the locker room. 
He is horrible in p:ess confer-
ences. Most of all, he is horrible 
on the field . Everybody on the 
team is worse because of his 
presence. Admittedly, Kramer is 
not that much better, but he's no 
cry baby. 

It is hard for me to admit, but 
the Chargers actually have some 
promise. Their defense ill certain-
ly among the best in th~ league 
(as long as they aren't playing the 
Packers of the Chiefs}.Their 
offense needs help. 

Here is the first step to suc-
cess. Bite the bullet, take the

UCSD Is Primed for Playoffs 
Bill Burger 
Back-up QB isn't 
worth keeping 

Let me get this out of the 
way in the beginning, I hate 
Charger football! I laugh at the 
Chargers' woeful offense, and 
even watching Seau dancing 
around the field gets annoying 
to me. This being said, I am 
going to give management a 
bit of advice. Get rid of Ryan 
Leaf. 

I like to play poker so I will 
use card playing as my analo-
gy. In the beginning of a hand, 
your cards can look promis-
ing. They might have a lot of 
potential. You may invest a lot 
of money based on your 
expectations. When you get 
part of the way through and 
your promising hand begins to 
look like garbage, dump it! 
Save yourself the anguish of 
continuing on. 

So what if the Chargers 
traded Eric Metcalf and a 
plutora of draft riCks to get 
Leaf. So what i they gave 
him an $11 million signing 
bonus. In economics (believe 
it or not I do occasionally go 
to class) these are referred to 
as sunk costs. In general, 
sunk costs should have no 
place in your reasoning and 
in this case, the Chargers

So the second half of week 

one resumed much like the 
first: offensive stagnation and 
defensive fortitude. Okay, so 
the guy's quarterback couldn't 
muster more than six on the 
board during the second half 
as the sun fell behind the hill. 
But there's something to be 
said for posting six on the 
scoreboard in a contest as 
defensively juiced as this one, 
despite failing to score the 
two-point conversion. 

It was off an interception by 
the guy's cohort in the sec-
ondary, but that play was as 
notable as the one fan who 
lives through a soccer riot in 
Calcutta. 

God was watching the 
Freeballers on that Friday 
afternoon. The guy's team 
took home the 6-0 victory, 
there were no bloodr eyes,

COMPEIIIION: Women's soccer team enters regional competition for 14th consecutive season 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Women's Soccer 
team is venturing into territory 
that it has charted for over a 
decade: the enchanting world of 
the playoffs. 

For the 14th year in a row, the 
Tritons are participants in the 
Division-lII NCAA 
Championships. They are the 
only team to do so every year 
since 1986. 

"[Head Coach) Brian 
McManus deserves the credit for 
the consistency of the program," 
UCSD Student Intercollegiate 
Director Bill Gannon said. 
"Obviously there have been some 
great players also." 

The Tritons' excellent record of 
15-1-1 earned them tickets to the 
postseason and a goodbye to first 
-round action on Wednesday. 

In addition to playing in the 
playoffs, UCSD will host a num-
ber of games. 

"We have a terrific staff," 
Gannon said. "We've hosted 
dozens of regionals before." 

The West Regional portion of 
the playoffs began yesterday 
evening. California Lutheran 
University defeated Chapman 
University 2-1, while the 
University of Puget Sound from 
Washington headed to Oregon 
and edged Willamette University 
1-1, (4-3 on penalty kicks) ending 
first-round aetion. 

UCSD hosts the remaining 
regional games on Saturday and 
Sunday at Triton Soccer Stadium, 
beginning the second round of 
the playoffs. 

On Saturday, UC Santa Cruz 
(16-2) will play the University of 
Puget Sound at 2:30 p.m. Then at 
5 p.m. Saturday, the Tritons will 
be in action when they take on 
Cal Lutheran. The regional cham-
pionship game will be played 
Sunday at 1 p.m. 

The Tritons' hopes are high for 
coming out of the weekend with a 
regional championship. 

UCSD defeated Cal Lutheran 3-

Usa Huff/Guarai8l1 
DIIeIIIC: Senior middle defender Janine Harispe (8), (shown here battling a Master's College 
opponent) will help lead her team in the postseason against Cal Lutheran on Saturday, Nov. 6th. 
o on Oct. 10, so the Tritons should 
not have to worry about develop-
ing a winning strategy. 

Against UC Santa Cruz, 
which is the favorite to 
face UCSD in the 
final, the Tritons had 
an easy time of it, 
winning handily 
3-1 on Oct. 23. 

The next regional 
champions move into the 
NCAA quarterfinals, which 
will be held on other campuses of 
participating coUeges on Nov. 13-

14. 
The national semifinal and 

finals will be held Nov. 20-21 at 
participating institutions as well. 

The Tritons are riding a 
nine-game winning streak, 

only losing to Westmont 
College 1-0 and 
tying Azusa 
Pacific University 

1-1. 
This is the last year that 

UCSD is competing in 
Division-III play, as it moves to 
Division-II competition next year. 

"I think they're focused more 
on who their opponent is going to 
be," Gannon saId. "Next year is a 
long way away." 

UCSD enters the tournament 
ranked fifth in the 
NSCAA/ Adidas rankings while 
UC Santa Cruz was ranked 15th. 
The University of Puget Sound 
and Chapman University were 
not ranked. 

Be sure to come out to the 
Triton soccer field as UCSD takes 
on Cal Lutheran in the Tritons' 
first playoff game. 

Victory Brings Playoff Hopes 
UPSET: Bryan Song's game-winning goal over CSUSB pushes UCSD closer 
ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The sirens of the playoffs are 
beckoning, and the UCSD men's 
soccer team is going to answer the 
alluring call of the post season. 

The UCSD Men's Soccer team 
greatly enhanced its playoff 
chances on Monday with 
what has to be its 
biggest win of the 
season, defeating Cal 
State San Bernardino 
(CSUSB) by the nar-
rowest of margins (1-0) 
while on the road Monday. 

The game was a hard-fought 
match against a Division" oppo-
nent, and was maybe even one of 
the toughest competitions of the 
year. Nonetheless, UCSD was 
charismatic and came through 
when it counted. 

"It was a needed one," Head 
Coach Derek Armstrong said of the 

a'eto against CSUSB. "After that at USD [an 8-2 loI8 on 'day), it was a bit of a respite." 
The fint half was a scoreless 

affair, with both sides struggling 
to find the net. The Tritons knew 
that if they did not return home 
with a win, their future may not 
contain much more soccer action. 

The second half of play was 
when UCSD set its own fate. 

Sixty-four minutes and six 
seconds into the game, still in 

a scoreless deadlock, the 
Tritons' Bryan Song 

grabbed a pass from 
Cameron Adams. 

Song, with the 
game and the season 

on the line, went up 
the otherwise-

CSUSB goalIceeper, 
Matt Keake. Song booted the ball 
pass Keake for the 1-0 lead and a 
probable trip to the post season. 

"It was a terrific goal," 
Armstrong said. HWe were just 
pushing." 

UCSD, with only nine shots 
for the entire game as compared 
to CSUSB's 12, held on for the rest 
of the night, eventually claiming 
the 1~ upset victory. 

The lWlons' Acilms took tMe 

shots with the assist. while team-
mates lYler Thompson and Mike 
Sanders each took two. Spencer 
Herbert and Song blasted one goal 
each. 

CSUSB was led by Eddie 
Williams, who booted five shots 
but couldn't find the net once. 
Williams also drew the game's only 
yellow card when he disputed a 
call by the referee 62 minutes into 
the game. 

The win came with some 
thoughtful roster moves by 
Armstrong. 

Brady Bernard, one of the 
Triton stars, spent most of the 
game on defense, until his pres-
ence and pIaf!ng became esaential. 

"We had [Bernard) in the back 
becatl8e of injuries," Armstrong 
said. "Then f moved him for-
ward. We got the goal, and I 
mowd him back." 

Though it looks as if the post 
season is at hand, the 1iitons are a 
little banged up and are obvious-
ly worried about being at less
