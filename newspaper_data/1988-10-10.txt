New Student 
Rec Facility 
Proposed

May Lose Hours 
In an effort to ease recreational 

facility overcrowding, a new 
complex has been proposed. While 
the complex would be useful for 
sports activities, one campus offi-
cial admitted that it would not be 
the answer to UCSD's current 
laCk of a large concert venue. 

The "Recreational/ Intramural 
and Athletic Complex Program 
and Planning Committee" was 
formed last quarter by Chancel-
lor Atkinson because of a "per-
ception of need" by "campus con-
stituents" for a now recreation 
facility to alleviate overcrowding 
at current facilities, according to 
committee chair Tom Tucker, 
assistant vice chancellor for un-
dergraduate affairs. 

When it meets Oct. 18, the 
committee will try to plan a new 
recreational facility which would 
mainly be used for sports activi-
ties and would not be appropriate 
for large concert or cultural 
events. 

The committee will be forming 
investigative subcommittcel made 
up of any interested parties. 

The committee consists of stu-
denb from all five colleges, an 
alumnus, directors from recrea-
tion, athletic and registration fee 
departments, and representatives 
from the Associated Students and 
graduate student, faculty and staff 
associations.

providing information to students. For more photos, see page 3. 

Tucker said two sites are under 
consideration for a mUlti-purpose 
facility. both north of Third Col-
lege - one adjacent to the Super-
computer, the other near the play-
ing fields there. 

Tucker hopes the "recreation 
center [will] make a big difference 

in the interim before the Events 
Center [is built)." 

(No "Events Center" is currently 
under serious consideration. "It's 
merely a gleam in our eyes at this 
point," one administrator said.)

Many student UC employCC's 
may find their work hours cut 
back if the University decides to 
reform its current health benefit 
plan, according to A.S. vice-
president Mordecai Potash. 

This change in the health bene-
fit program is the result of Inter-
nal Revenue Section 89 created 
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 
which set non-discrimination stan-
dards for eligibility for employee-
sponsored health and benefit 
plans. 

Essentially, the code requires 
that all employees working 17.S 
hours or more per week be pro-
vided with health and life insu-
rance equal to at least 75 percent 
of the value of the benefits pro-
vided to the highly compensated 
employees of the institution. 

In this context, "highly com-
pensated" means having an in-
come in excess of SSO,OOO per 
year. 

The new plan, called the 
"CORE Benefit Plan," sounds 
great at first to students but actu-
ally might end up hurting them," 
Potash said. 

"Graduate students liked this pr~ 
gram initially," Potash said, .. but 
it really isn't the kind of basic 
health care that they really need." 

A few aspects of the new pl~n 
include: 
• S2,OOO deductible 

ELSI q·eencemed ~t~ the development of new 
techniques (or conservation o( natural resources 
aDd the promotion of existiQl ~lm\qucs.

of medical costs between 52,000 
and $7,000 
• the University pays all costs of 

medical bills totalling from $7,000 
to S250,OOO 
• no mental health coverage 

Potash maintains that because 
this plan will go into effect auto-
matically for employees who work 
more than 17.S hours per week, 
there is a good chance that the 
U niversitv will cut students' hours 

-to below the 17.S hours mark. 
This, according to Potash. will 

prevent the University from hav-
ing to pay the- benefits to these 
employees. 

Under the old plan. students 
who worked over 20 hours a week 
had the option of applying for 
benefits - it was not automatic. 

On October 4 and 6, meetings 
were held by the Office of the 
President at UCLA and UC Ber-
keley to gather student opinions 
on the issue. 

Student representation at both 
meetings was relatively low -
only five students showed up at 
Los Angeles and IS at Berkeley. 

"Poor student turnout always 
tells the University that they can 
do what they want without very 
much student outcry," Potash 
said. 

"I learned some things about 
student views on health insur-
ance," said Mary Beth Snyder.

Tenant Refuses to Make Way 
For New Student Housing 

BERKELEY - A North Berkeley resident is refus-
ing to be evicted from a UC Berkeley-owned apart-
ment building in ~rder to make way for construction 
of a 790-bed student dormitory. 

Vincent Saccomanno, who has lived in the apart-
ment for 15 years , said yesterday that UC Berkeley 
officials have failed to assist him in finding housing he 
can afford . 

MThe only alternative I have is to put my belongings 
in the street and become a street person," Sacco-
manno said. 

Last spring, university officials purchased two 
buildings with the intent of demolishing them to make 
room for a proposed $34 million student Imusing pro-
ject. Tenants received 30-<1ay relocation notices in 
July and all have since vacated the rentals except for 
Saccomanno, according to attorneys. representing the 
university. . 

The California Relocation Assistance Law requires 
that the university pay up to $4,000 over a four-year 
period to any tenant evicted from state-owned prop-
erty to compensate for possible higher rents. UC Ber-
keley attorneys said the university has already paid 
Saccomanno $4,500 and has also offered him tempor-
ary university housing until he finds a place to live. 

"In our view, we have done everything the law 
requires and in some ways we have gone beyond 
that," attorney Tim Walker said.

President Quayle? 
Political Science Professor Sam Popkin has "been . 

around," as they say. He lost his political virginity 
long ago. While teaching classes here, he trips into the 
bizarre world of national politics as a polling analyst 
for CBS News e'Well, Dan, the latest numbers show 
that Bush is doing better among defense con-
tractors ... j . 

Not much in politics surpr1sel Popkin 8.Dymore, 
but this campaign has been special, he says, He has 
been repeatedly "astonished." 

The latest time was last Wednesday, by the 
performance of Dan Quayle during the vice pres-
idential "debate." 

Given not one, not two, but three chances to say 
what he would do if God forbid he became president 
because of a national tragedy, Quayle had no 
response beyond the hope that he would by then 
"know the Cabinet on a first name basis." 

The question was the political equivalent of a 
batting practice pitch, easy to hit out of the park. But 
Quayle blew it. He blew it because neither he nor 
Bush's advisors had ever really thought through the 
concept of a Quayle presidency. 

It's easy to see why this astonishes Popkin. It is, 
after all, a failure to consider what is the most 
important role of a vice president. 

Quayle's political career has been marked by more 
than an average amount of shallowness for a 
politician. The truth is, he has never really gotten 

. anywhere on his own, without his father's money, and 
is widely considered by Bush's advisors to be 
intellectually incapable M handling even the vice 
presidency . 

Conservatives gleeful at the prospect of four more 
years should consider whether "President Quayle" is 
somethins safe fur the world. . 

Quayle said last Wednesday that the fU"St thing he 
would do if he somehow ascended to the presidency is 
bow down in prayer. 

We would, too. 

Right/Left 
We must not be doing too bad a job. 
We got excoriated in the Disorientation Manual of 

the leftist New Indicator u : "opportunistic hucksters 
'With [our] risht hand reaching into administration 
pockets and [our] left hand obsequiously extended 
tow3rds the conservative San Diego business com-
munity." 

Meanwhile, the right-wing California Review's 
fint issue &aid the Guardian, suspiciously, "moves a 
little further to the left every year." 

And then there's the Koala, which defined part of 
its editorial mission as printing "nothing that would 
ever be in the GUIUditm." 

FEIFFERe 

Letters 

Brown-nosing 
the Adm'n 
Editor: 

The deceptive claw of the admin-
stration has once again claimed 
another victim - the GUIlrdian. Last 
week's front page article "Crowd Runs 
Wild; Concert Cut Short"( GUDrdion, 
Oct. 3) was both misleading and 
brown-nosing to the administration. 
Yes, there were problems at this event 
as Programming Commissioner 
Jonathan Judaken, the UCSD Police 
Department and UEO Events 
Chairman Larry Weintraub stated in 
the article. 

But how many people read more 
than the first few lines of an article 
anyway? The headline and the photo 
are the two most influential tools in 
journalism. And by the sound of this 
one, what reader could deduct oth-
erwise that the crowd at last Friday's 
BGIF was anything but the cause of 
its premature ending? 

It is not apparent to me that the 
blame could be "laid anywhere in 
particular," as Weintraub states, but 
is entirely the fault of the A.S. crowd 
control planning for a band as widely 
known as the Untouchables was 
completely overlooked by the A.S. 
The scheduling of a free concert at 

9:30 on a Friday evening was bound 
to attract more people than the aver-
age T.G. would. 

The article was informative and 
did present the facts along with a few 
too many quotes from Judaken, but a 
bannered headline as ridioulously 
overstated as this brings to mind 
images of rioting at the Gym steps. ]t 
also infers that students are unable to 
assemble without violence where 
alcohol is served. This is the message 
that the adminstration for so long has 
tried to indoctrinate into our univer-
sity in order to create a dry, asocial 
campus. 

I am not placing the blame on the 
GlUUdUm. This was their attempt at 
creating controversy where apathy 
usually prevails. But as a student here 
I've always believed that the function 
of a university paper is to inform and, 
more importantly, to uphold the 
rights and wishes of the "silent major-
ity" of students. The Guardian's tab-
loid approach has done nothing less 
than threaten the fate of future TGs 
with a piece of hyped-up journalism. 

Nonie GanakJa 

(Editor's note; alcohol was not 
served at the BG/F.) 

514,000 Beer 
Fund Wasterul 
EdItor: 

Of all the ways to spend $14,000, 
our A.S. Council is going to blow it 
on beer, which is a mistake. There are 
too many under-funded student acti-
vities for us to put half of our pro-
gramming budget into brew. 

[A.S. Programming Coordinator 
Jonathan] Judaken says he wants to 
help revive this campus' "apathetic 
and stagnant" social life, but this 
won't do it; handing out this kind of 
socialized medicine doesn't lead to 
enlightened social events, it gets peo-
ple drunk. 

The A.S. Council's claim to launch 
a "revolution against apathy" by pur-
chasing thousands of dollars worth of 
beer is also baseless. To fight apathy 
we need to be sober and we need a 
council that will spend our money on 
projects that will give us something 
more back than a party on Friday 

. and a hangover on Saturday. 
What a waste.

Grove Prices 
Too High 
EdItor: 

I As Student Advocate, one of 
the requirements of my job is to 
represent student concerns to the 
A.S. Council. Likewise, I am also 
required to represent the Council 
to the students at large , In order 
to do my job effectively, I need to 

..,. hear from you. 
It has come to my attention 

that the Council is currently con-
sidering expansion of the Grove 
Caffe Personally, I am for the 
expansion and I will give my sup-
port to the issue. I am, however, 
concerned about the prices for 
beverages at the cafe (i.e., I feel 
that they are too high - even 
more expensive then many off-
camp~s coffee houses). 

I am also concerned about the 
fact that the cafe promulgates 
thousands of styrofoam cups into 

.... our waste bins every day. Docs 
anyone else think it strange for 
the AS to pass a resolution 
directed toward the campus food 
services asking them to eliminate 
the use of styrofoam, and then 
tolerate its use in its own enter-

... prises? What's your opinion? 
I am of the belief that campus 

services should be seared toward 
offering students materials at the 
lowest possible prices for the 
highest quality items. This is an 
issue which goes beyond the 

.... Caffe, but it is my hope that con-
cerned students will use the cur-
rent opportunity to voice their 
feelings on these matters. Cast 
your bid for the Fortune 500 or 
co-ops! 

I propose that as the council 
.. ~ approves the expansion of the 

Grove Caffe, it also require the 
cafe to rebate some of its profits 
(at $36,000 last year) to its custo-
mers in the form of lower prices, 
and that the council require the 

The school's growing at a 
phenomenal rate. However, 
the facilities for students use 
are not increasing at all. Bur 
the administration should 
realize this fact and compen-

Editor: 

Though I support Bush, I also 
agree with Derick Scovel that the 
Reagan/ Bush administration has 
neglected the poor (Guardian, 
Sept. 26). However, that's its only 
important point to to me: that the 
next administration, Democratic 
or RepUblican, should show more 
<:o ncern for the poor. 

John Fisher's misdirected re-
sponse to Scovel (Guardian, Oct. 
3), his misdirected mission against 
anyone's theology that does not 
agree with his own, has no place 
between Christians , 

Christians can be liberal or 
conservative, but they should all 
be marked by love for their 
neighbor. I think it is wrong for 
Christians to insult each other 
(however cleverly), taking jabs at 
each other's faith for the sake of 
political arguments. 

Nobody needs to hear endless 
quotes of scripture; we only need 
to see a few people try to live by it . 
Then people will listen. 

As for Scovel and Fisher: argue 
politics if you wish, but don't try 
to get Jesus to side with you. The 
Bible says nothing about Dukakis 
or Bush .

Editor's note; We wish to thank 
all those who wrote in response to 
Seo·vel's commentary; however, 
after three issues, we'd like 10 call 
a hall to this particular dis-
cws;on.

Yes! / think there should 
be afacilitiy for concerts. 
Regarding last week's 
Untouchables' concert, it was 
very poorly planned with a 
lack of awareness of the 
band's popularity. 

I don 't think it's as much in 
the design as it is in the plan-
ning, They could 've had the 
[Untouchables] concert at 
Mile-High with a big stage, 
and there wouldn't have been 
any problems, 

No, I most certainly do 
not ! / think that we should 
make the best our of what we 
have. Instead of spending 
available money on more 
such facilities , I would rather 
see it spent on such things as 
research and educational JoceLiza Gonza.a

I'm afraid, however, that the 
praervation of "academic free-
dom" bas been &Cbie~ ·at the 
CJtpcue of free speech, which 
iroaic:aJJy ""81 the onpaai sue at

to Hait information tbat .ru,ht 
JIll iDto the Ioc:aI papen tbat were 
..... battle apinst us. Infor-
mation JIWI&8C1DCDl became a 
crucial coocem and a real survival 
tactic and is today embedded 
deeply inlo tbe orpnizational and 
policy structure of the Univenity, 
I)'IDbotized by tbe Public Infor-
mation Office. There is an inabil-
ity to obtain real information 
about the univenity for even top 
admiDiltrators, who have trouble 
.aettin& real daaa about UCSD 
with whicb to make realistic 
administrative decisions. 

This university wiD be a univer-
airy in name only until we ltart·to 
mature toward the notion of free 
ad open diacoune. With 30,000 
people iq an institution that is 
touted as ODe of the top scientific 
reseuch universities in the coun-
lIy, surely we are eltabliabed 
enouah and mature eno"ab to be 
Uk to talk openly. 

I am JladdeDCd by the GUIIT-
ditm'l attempt to borrow from the 
DtIily Cll/at Berkeley abe discus-
lion of possible election of the 
JleFnts ( GUllTdiIIn, Sept. 26). But 
I think it apocryphal botb for 

your effort and fOr this campus 
that the issue "las genera ted at 
Berkeley and not here. Maybe 
some day this campus will have 
the courale to pnerate wues for 
open dlJCUSsion. 

Sexual harassment is such an 
issue. The university.. responsi-
bility to achieve diversity is ano-
ther. Interaction with the city 
another, the inadequate staffing 
for student needa another. 

All of us who work here and 
have any knowledge at aU about 
other departments know that the 
student enrollment keep climb-
ing, but that the money genetated 
by the IetiJlature to provide for 
Itudent services doesn't keep 
apace. 

You wonder why you stand in 
lines, why you can't get your 
needs met, and I know that there 
are many, if not most offices on 
this campus with people working 
long, long overtime hours just to 
try \0 keep up because there is not 
enough money to hire staff. 

The Los Ang~/~s 1im~s raised 
an important public issue - as 
far as the Unive[$ity of California 
is concerned - recently in an edi-
torial, calling for UC to devote 
more real emphasis to undergra-
duate education. The editorial was 
naive in terms of how university 
budgets are driven, but such a 
pu blic discussion could be a pow-
erfullearning experience, and it is 
appropriate for us to have it. 

I'm hopefulltill, 25 years later, 
lha.t we can become a real univer-
sity with uosanitized discourse. 

Instead we remain a fearful 
academic enclave, stumbling 
along in an ethos of exceUence of 
intent but mediocrity of action, 

OPINION 

EDITOR 
IN 
A 

Box 

(Editor in a Box appears ~~ry Mond4y wr;lItn by a diffn-tnt 
Guardian ~ditor) 

See Anything Different? 
By SABRINA YOUMANS 
Arts Editor 

I am a woman. Look above my 
name, at the title, "Editor in a 
Box," and at the graphic. It is a 
basic drawing of an editor sitting 
in front of a typewriter. The edi-
tor is a woman, like me. 

Last week, there was a problem 
with the artwork. Jeff, the Opin-
ion Editor, requested a graphic of 
an editor and 80t a man sitting at 
a typewriter. 

I am writing the column this 
week and I requested that the 
graphic be redone as a female. 
Silly? Trite? Hypersensitive to 
gender issues? Okay, I can admit 
to beina sensitive if you can admit 
it is sexist to automatically assume 

that an editor is a man, especially 
when the graphic artist who 
designed the graphic is a woman. 

One single incident perhaps, 
but it echos the universal devalua-
tion of women. Universals are 
absolutes that span across all 
known and documented cultures. 
There are very few universall. 
Biological functions are common 
universals, like eating, reproduCe 
ina and communicating. There 
are some interesting universals 
that involve gender identification 
and sexuality. In all cultures there 
exists the incest taboo. There is 
also the uQivenal WV.QCtbinking 
about women: that women are 
inferior to men. • ,. 
., Our cuhure bas many subtle 

ways of telling women that they 
are only women and not quite like 

The VCSD Guardian 

men. Language is the most cogent 
way of devaluing women. The 
pronoun h~ is often used to 
represent all members of the 
society. He does not represent or 
mean women; M mean~ men only 

H~ / Sh~. sh~ or h~. her/his. are all 
polite. even though somewhat 
awkward, ways to refer to both 
senders until a neuter pronoun 
evolves. 

MtIII is an extension of the 
usaae of M . Like he, people 
commonly use mtlll and men to 
refer to all members of society. 
MtIII means mlln, not woman. If 
you are referring to everyone, use 
humtlllity. 

As a woman, there is only one 
thing fun\lier than being called a 
man. It is being called a girl. I 
admit that I am almost 21, and I 
still have braces, so I might look a 
little younger, but I don't think I 
looks as young as 12. I am capa-
ble of having sex, bearing child-
ren, and being responsible for 
myself. I am offended at being 
called a child . Especially a girl, 
wbich is loaded with all sorts of 
connotations of being innocent, 
virginal, sweet, naive, and not 
capable of being taken seriously. 

"It is impossible to approach 
any human problem with a mind 
free from bias," Simone De 
Beauvior once said, so I admit 
that I am inCfedibly biased as a 
woman. But it is an important 
question to ask yourself, as De 
Beauvior asked herself, "How is it 
that this world has always be-
longed to the men .. . ?" And, as I 
asked myself, how is it that until 
today the Editor in a Box has 
always been a man?

The UCSD Guardian 

Employe~ 
Continued rrom pale I 
Office ofthe President, who was a 
member of the panel of adminis-
trators at UCLA. 

"They [the students] really don't 
think it's a great plan to begin 
with. 

"Health insurance is a problem 
with undergraduates," Synder 
said, "but I think that it is mainly 
a problem with graduate students 
because many of them aren't co-
vered by their parents' health plan 
anymore." 

Word from the Office of the 
President confirms Potash 's con-
cern for students' work hours. 

Ellen Switkes, director of Aca-
demic Personnel and also a mem-
ber of the panel at UCLA said 
that there is no way to protect 
students from having their hours' 
cut back. 

If any students would like to 
offer their_ opinions or have any 
questions on the matter of stu-
dent health insurance, they can 
contact Mordecai Potash at the 
A.S. office. 

Recreation 
Continued from p.,e I 
ine the results of an extensive stu-
dent survey. Tucker said he has 
received approximately 4,000 such 
surveys, which asked students to 
name their priorities in campus 
recreation. 

Survey results will be used to 
focus the various subcommittees, 
which will be investigating the 
needs and requirements of separ-
ate parts ofthe facility, such as the 
weight lifting section, the basket-
ball/volleyball area, etc. 

After the subcommittees report 
later this quarter, the recreation 
committee will meet with the Plan-
ning Department and steps will 
be taken in the building process. 

Tucker said that if all goes well, 
it will be about "three-and-a-half 
to four-and-a-half years before 
the doors open." 

He also said that students, 
faculty and staff are "strongly 
encouraged" to join the subcom-
mittees. The Oct. 18 meeting will 
be open to all from 4 to 6 p.m. in 
the Undergraduate Affairs Con-
ference Room in the International 
Center. 

ERRATA 
In the Monday Oct. 6 
article, "A.S. to Spend 
$14,000 on Beer," 
Vanness Harris'name 
was inadvertently 
misspelled. The 
Guardian apologizes 
for this error.

EAP Students Develop New World Views 

Open Attitudes Absorb Culture Shock 
By SETH SLATER 
Contribuu'nK Writer 

F rom the midnight sun of the Arctic Circle to the Barrier 
Reef of Australia, they have visited 
ancient ruins, danced in front of 
cathedrals, strolled with monkeys 
10 the jungle, and trekked through 
,he mountains of Nepal. 

These were some experiences 
of a handful of UCSO's 124 stu-
dents who went abroad last year 
through the Education Abroad 
Program. 

EAP, sponsored by the Uni-
versity of California , features 
programs in 33 countries world-

wide and provides an opponunity 
for students to study abroad while 
earning UC credit, according to 
an EAP pamphlet. 

Any student of junior standing 
meeting the minimum require-
ments of a 3.0 GPA, credit for 
required langu~ge courses, and 
the suppon of the campus EAP 
Selection Committee is eligible to 
participate in the program. 

Although the EAP is an aca-
demic program, focusing on clas-
ses is not always easy. 

"The first quaner, you don't 
want to study," Jennifer Slakey, a 
21-year-old senior who just re-
turned from Kenya, said. "You 

want to go out and travel and get 
adjusted. " 

Slakey initially thought it would 
be difficult to adjust to being in 
the racial minority during her 
Kenya experience. 

"At first, I looked around and 
noticed that I was the only white 
person in a room, or I was the 
only woman and I happened to be 
the only white woman [in the 
group]," she said. "It jars you at 
first but then, after a few weeks, 
you're just one of the gang so you 
don't even notice it." 

Others, however, do notice, 
Slakey said, recalling a trip to a 
small town in western Kenya dur-

ing which a friend inadvenently 
frightened a small child. 

"One of my friends was walk-
ing down the street," she explained 
between bursts of laughter, "and 
this little kid saw her and turned 
around and staned screaming and 
running because she wasn't used 
to white people." 

Once, Slakey said, she was 
actually hit by a car while crossing 
a street because the woman driv-
ing by slowed down, but failed to 
stop, apparently enthralled at the 
sight of Slakey's pale skin. 

"It wasn't painful," the accident 
victim said, "because she was 
going slow enough so she could 
look at me. She just kind of 

nudged me." But she admitted, 
"When , first got back [to the 
U.S.], I'd hesitate at crossings all 
the time." 

Cindy Lockett, while touring 
India's state of Punjab by motor-
cycle, found that Americans tra-
veling abroad are sometimes met 
with a different kind of curiosity. 

'" was thought to be a CIA 
agent," Lockett said, "and I was 
followed by the most conspicuous 
man." He was wearing sunglasses 
and a hat. Eventually the under-
cover officer pulled her over and 
demanded to see her passpon. 
After a conversation with her 
companion, which Lockett was

UCSD Professors Critique 
Vice Presidential Debates 

By ADAM LEVY 
Slaff Wri'~r 

"The biggest debit ever" as a 
vice presidential candidate and 
"awfully boring. "These are Dan 
Quayle's debate notices from two 
UCSD professors. 

According to polls before the 
Oct. 5 debate, many people were 
more comfonable with Lloyd 
Bentsen than Quayle, and felt 
Bentsen was more qualified to 
take over the presidency in the 
case of an emergency. 

In the aftermath of the debate, 
many analysts seem to agree that 
Bentsen gave the stronger per-

formance, yet they are still unsure 
as to how the public will react in 
the future to Quayle's perfor-
mance. 

An ABC poll, taken after the 
debate, showed that Quayle did 
not dispel public doubts about his 
qualifications. 

When people were asked if they 
thought the candidates had the 
qualifications to assume the pre-
sidency, 48 percent thought 
Quayle did, while 47 percent 
thought he didn 't. Bentsen, on the 
other hand, received the confi-
dence of 87 percent of those 
que.stioned.

one of the debate panelists, said 
on "Night line," that Quayle's 
answers were "a bit unconvinc-
ing" and "a bit r:nemorized." 

The Republican vice presiden-
tial candidate was asked by the 
panel four times what immediate 
steps he would take if required to 
assume the presidency in the event 
of an emergency. Quayle dodged 
the question by simply claiming 
that he possessed excellent creden-
tials . 

"Age alone is not the only qual-
ification, you've got to look at 
experience and you've got to look 
at accomplishments, "Quayle said.

"You definitely make mis-

foreign language, "but making 
mistakes is one of the best ways to 
make friends because you make 
people laugh [and] they realile 
that you are fallible. It 's actually a 
good conduit to a more friendly 
situation. Making mistakes is 
almost one of the most fun pans 
of going abroad." 

Exploring new places and learn-

enjoyable aspect of going a broad, 
EAP panicipants agreed.

faced howler monkeys c1imbling

Not aU settling-in experiences: 
are as dramatic as these, but 
adjusting to a new land, accord-
ing to Gabrielle Kaufman, a senior 
who recently returned from Spain, 
"is not a piece a cake." She 
explained that she had a hard 
time believing the warnings before 
going abroad that she would find 
herself on "an emotional roller 
coaster all year ... 

The Muir College literature 
major advises to "get involved 
in something over there . .. find an 
outlet for your energy. It sounds 
really silly, but it keeps you on 
something." 

Rob Meine, a political science 
major who studied at the Univer-
sity of Lund in Sweden, said that 
he was occasionally touched by 
homesickness after talking with 
friends from back home, espe-
cially if he was not doing some-
thing exciting at the time. 

"But then it all turns around," 
he said, "and it might be [as early 
as] that afternoon that you go and 
meet a new person or learn a new 
funny word and all of a sudden 
you can't imagine what you were 
thinking, why you'd want to be 
home." 

Of course, in some countries, 
the natives make travelers feel 
welcome right away. 

Sabrina Mazzoni said that dur-
ing her first week in Costa Rica, 
the owner of a shop she was in 

urged her to buy some goods; 
striking up a conversation which 
ended in a marriage proposal. 

"He staned talking to me," 
Mazzoni said, "and invited me to 
dinner and said 'I want to marry 
you, you're so nice.' " Mazzoni 
tried to be pleasant, she explain-
ed, but said to her admirer, "111 
marry you some other time." 

Michael Gehrisch, who also 
studied at Lund, said that learn-
ing the language and showing a 
willingness to speak it helped him 
meet people and build close friend-
ships - a travel tip the bashful 
might find difficult to employ. 

Mazzoni's other exploratory ad-
ventures included tracking fresh 
jaguar prints along a jungle path 
and a trip to Volcan Arenal, an 
active volcano whose natural 
energy is harnessed to warm a 
man-made pool along a local river 
not far from where she studied. 

The volcano "made a little bit 
of noise while we were there, but 
[was] nothing to be worried 
about," Mazzoni said in her char-
acteristically casual voice. 

Mazzoni 's enthusiasm for her 
field study project, perhaps one of 
the more unique aspects of the

Debate Puts Quayle 
to the Test 
~ Continued from pale 10 

"I will be prepared to carry out 
the responsibilities of the presi-
dency of the United States of 
America." 

"The canned speeches were 
awfully boring and reflect the bad 
state of presidential politics." 

Desks, Computer Furniture, Chairs, Drafting Tables, 
Bookcases, File Cabinets, Desk Lamps, and much more 

When the issue was brought up 
for a fourth time, Quayle once 
again answered by praising his 
own credentials. He proceeded to 
compare his own credentials with 
those of John F. K.ennedv. 

In response to this claim, Bent-
sen made the most cutting remark 
of the debate. 

"Senator, I served with Jack 
Kennedy. I knew Jack K.ennedy. 
Jack Kennedy was a friend of 
mine. Senator, you're no Jack 
Kennedy," Bentsen said. 

A major criticism of this debate 
(and the previous presidential 
debate) was ofthe lack of sponta-
neity and the use of preconceived 
answers to the questions . 

On "Nightline," for example, 
reporter Ann Colton said Bent-
sen's Jack Kennedy barb was 
planned in advance. 

.If Colton said. "He knew that 
Quayle would try to wrap himself 
up in the mantle of John F. 
Kennedy, he had an answer ready 
and he used it ." 

"The canned speech-
es were awfully bor-
ing and reflect the bad 
state of presidental 
politics." 

-Daniel C. Hallin 

In response to Quayle's answer 
on assuming the presidency, media 
specialist and UCSD communi-
cation department Chairman Dr. 
Daniel C. Hallin said, "They had 
these little canned speeches that 
their advisors had prepared them 
~ with. All Quayle had in his head 

were these speeches and none of 
th~ speeches were really ap-
propriate to the question." 

Hallin added, "In conclusion. it 
was a terrible debate in the sense 
that they weren'l answering the 
questions, and tbey weren't 
speaking to one another, 

The audience may have been 
pre-programmed to respond at 
different points in the debate, 
Hallin noted. 

For example, Quayle said, "I 
have a good record on the envir-
onment. to At that point. people 
began to laugh. That isn't the sort 
of thing at which most people 
would spontaneously laugh, Hal-
lin added. 

One-third of the seats were 
Democratic and one-third Re-
pUblican. 

The day after the debate, politi-
cal partisans called "spin doctors" 
tried to steer media and public 
opinion to believe that their can-
didate had won. Bush support-
ers commended Quayle's perfor-
mance, claiming that Quayle stood 
strong on the panel's questions 
that were tougher on Quayle than 
on Bentsen. RepUblicans also 
berated Bentsen for not defend-
ing Dukakis' "liberal policies." 

The Dukakis camp, on the other 
hand. claimed the debate revealed 
that the choice of Quayle for vice 
president was a major blunder 
and reflects the bad judgment of 
George Bush. 

Does the public believe Quayle's 
qualifications are an issue? If it is 
an issue, can it be successfully 
exploited by Dukakis? 

According to UCSD Politi-
cal science Professor Samuel 
Popkin, doubts about Quayle are 
more salient than ever because 
"so many people got so much 
more exposure to him than they 
ever had before." 

Popkin, a CBS pollster, said "I 
think of all the vice presidential 
candidates I've ever associated 
with, the biggest debit ever to a 
ticket is Dan Quayle." 

Popkin has some experience at 
debates. He played the part of 
Ronald Reagan to prepare Presi-
dent Carter for their 1980 con-
frontations. 

"As a professional who had 
prepared peopi~ for debates for 
Congress, the Senate, vice presi-
dent and president, I was abso-
lutely astonished at his perfor-
mance, I've never been in a 
situation when a person did so

Students 
Abroad 
Continued from pale II 
EAP, was obvious. She described 
her research jaunts into thejungle 
to study epiphytes. and said she 
often scaled 25 to 30-meter tree 
with the aid of mountain climbing 
gear. 

Mazzoni. who studied abroad 
for one academic quarter, seemed 
to regret her limited time in Costa 
Rica. 
. "Timewise," she said. "there is 
Just too much to do in the two and 
a half months that we were there ." 

Other students stressed the ad-
ventures in culture they ex-
perienced while abroad . 

Lockett, considered an "untouch-
able" under the Indian caste sys-
tem. recalled that "I did have one 
Brahman man turn his back on 
me when he was eating because 
[he believed] I would pollute his 
food." 

The caste system was difficult 
to get used to, Lockett said, as 
was the sexual inequality and 
occasional reminders of poverty 
she would witness throughout her 
stay . 
. "There were some really depres-

SlOg parts," Lockett said, citing 
the beggars in Calcutta and cases 
of leprosy she saw while working 
at the Mother Theresa Center. 
She said, "I did see a dead man in 
the gutter once. " 

Siakey, who commented on 
some of the less attractive aspects 
of Kenyan culture, was quick to 
add a note of caution regarding 
ethnocentrism, saying, "I always 
had to remind myself that that's 
the way it is there and I can't go 
Over there with all my Western 
values and .. . impose [them] on 
their culture because that's not 
fair . That's not what EAP is all 
about. It's about learning about 
another culture and accepting that 
culture. But it was hard some-
times to do that." 

Some travelers would be sur-
prised to find any culture at all in 
a third world country, but, aecord-
ing to Valerie Nelson who spent a 
year in Mexico, "There's culture 
everywhere." 

The reason Americans may be

poorly when so easily he could've 
done better," Popkin said . 

Popkin justified his answer that 
Quayle had performed poorly by 

~ointi~g out that after a vice pre-
sldenhal debate, the one who is 
perceived as the winner is usually 
"pushed into bigger media 
markets ... [while] the side that 
thinks [they have] a problem will 
try to hide the candidate." 

It happened in 1976 when Bob 
Dole gave a bad performance as a 
vice presidential candidate and it 
also happened in 1984 when Ger-
aldine Ferraro faired poorly. 
Popkin explained . 

"This is exactly what has hap-
pened in the Democratic and 
Republican campaign this year." 
Popkin said . "Dukakis and Bent -
sen madejoint appearances, while 
Bus h failed to do so. Dukakis is 
continuing to aim at Quayle. while 
Bush has tried to minimi ze pub· 
licity about Quayle." 

Popkin remarked , "I th ink if it 
were not for Dan Quayle, George 
Bush would have the election 
sewn up." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Education 
Abroad 
Continued from pace 14 
blind to it, at least when they visit 
Tijuana, is that "that's not what 
they're looking for when they go 
down there. There is a cultural 
center in Tijuana that very few 
people have been to,"N'elson said. 

Nelson cited Mexico's long his-
tory, and pointed to the Aztec 
temples and the Palenque Ruins 
of the Mayas in southern Mexico 
as evidenCe that culture thrives 
even in the third world. 

For some, traveling abroad pro-
vided a new way of viewing their 
nation and themselves. 

Senior Vicki Hand said that 
her stay in Japan made her realize 
how isolated the United States is 
from the global community. 

"( think of America as probab-
ly the best place to live in the 
whole world, the most free place," 
but said that she now views her 
native land as also being "closed 
off," and largely oblivious to the 
outside world. 

Hand also discovered a new 
feeling of independence. 

"( realized that there's just so 
much you can do," Hand said. 
"You're never limited. If you feel 
stuck here ... there is always 
something you can do . .. you can 
see things and learn things about 
yourself and about the world 
around you that can keep you 
going for years." 

Hand's realizations about her-
self and her new perspective on 
the world are typical of how stu-
dents feel upon returning from 
otherculturet. According to Mony 
Ann McCarren, EAP coordinator 
and advisor, actually living among 
foreigners is often the only way to 
pick up on some of the subtleties 
of a foreign culture. 

"I definitely think you can't do 
any of that as a tourist," McCarren 
said, adding that at least one stu-
dent became so attached to the 
culture he visited that he asked for 
an extended stay. 

Ross Young, a graduate stu-
dent in international relations and 
Pacific studies, expressed a sim-
ilar view saying that he would like 
to retire in Australia someday, as 
he has come to miss "scuba diving 
in the Barrier Reef, chasing sharks 
and caressing seven-foot long 
moray eels, petting clams and 

FEATURES 
going to beautiful islands." 

But, Meine said . " EAP is not 
vacation-year abroad. You do 
have requirements to meet, and 
no matter how trivial they seem, 
they can turn out to be just as 
demanding as requirements here 
in San Diego." 

So, from the corridors of the 
Lund University in Sweden to the 
hallowed halls of the University 
of New South Wales in Australia, 
EAP students can also be found 
burning the midnight oil over 
their studies, taking a respite from 
the more alluring glamour of their 
cultural field .days abroad. 

For students interested in 
going abroad, the Education 
Abroad Program will be 
meeting Wednesday, Oct. 12 
at 7 p.m. in the International 
Center Lounge. 

Quest International, an 
EAP work-study travel fair, 
will be held at the Interna-
tional Center Oct. 21 . Repre-
sentatives from 40 study 
institutions will be present.

Try a Macintosh today-you 
may win a Sony Discman. 

Now that a new school year is 
under way, we have an idea that'll 
make both you and your parents 
feel a bit more confident come 
finals time: 

Get a Madntosh8 computer to 
help with your homework. 

Then you'll never have to spend 
another all·nighter retyping a paper 
just to purge a few typos and 
dangling modifiers. You'll be able to 
crank out assignments that look as 
though you bribed a friend in art 
school. And with an amazing new 
program called HyperCard8- which 
just happens to come packaged 
with every Macintosh - you can 
easily store, organize, and cross· 
reference research notes to your 
heart's content. 

And if that isn't enough reason 
to look at a Macintosh today, here's 
another: 

Right now, you have three 
chances to win one of Sony's 
Discman'" CD players-including 
the exciting Sony Pocket Discman, 
which also plays the new 3-inch 
CDs. And even if you miss out on 
the CD player, you may still win 
one of 15 Apple T-shirts. No 
strings attached-just fill out 
a registration form at the 
location listed below. 

Enter: October 3rd-October 21st 
University Center 
Cumputer Center · ':; .1+4291 

So come in and get your hands 
on a Macintaih. 

If nO{ for yourself, do it for 
your folks. 

The power to be your best. ..

McManus, nevertheless, praised 
the Sage Hens for earning 
"respectability." The last time 
these two teams met back in the 
beginning of September, the 
Tritons trounced them 10-0. In 
addition, McManus pointed out 
that Dulock's record-setting pace 
would have no more "gimmes." 
The next few games rate as the 
season's toughest, featuring fierce 
Division I and II competition. 

Today at 2:30, UCSD (ranked 
number two in the Far West 
Region [behind 6-1 St.Thomas] 
and number five nationally in 
Division III) will host the 
seventh-ranked team of Division 
II , Cal State Dominguez Hills. 

Schwaar described the Triton 
team as currently "getting the 
right mentality for Dominguez 
[Hills] ," emphasizing that they 
are "real psyched" for the Div-
ision 11 powerhouse whom UCSD 
has never beaten since the pro-
gram began back in 1969. 

Coach McManus stated that 
he will "be happy with a split" 
over the next six games against 
the stiff competition. He also 
pointed out that the opposition 
will be very adequate preparation 
and will harden his team for the 
divisional playoffs.

Victories Improve Triton Record to 23-5 

Weekend Sweep Puts Volleyball Back on Track 
By JONCARLO MARK 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD Women's Volley-
ball team swept victories over The 
Master's College and Pomona-
Pitzer University this weekend, 
raising their record to 23-5 and 
virtually solidifying a berth in 
post-season play. The final score 
of tbe Pomona-Pitzer match on 
Saturday night was 15-9, 1~14 
and 15-12. 

Leading the way for UCSD 
was outside hitter Rachel Vetter, 
who accumulated ten kills and 
supported defensively with 13 
digs. Also contributing for the 
Tritons was middle blocker Eli-
zabeth Tan, who delivered nine 
kills and came through with four 
solo blocks. 

As a team, the Tritons domi-
nated defensively with 64 dig5 
against only 27 for the Pomona-
Pitzer team. The Tritons also 

overpowered the Sage Hens from 
Pomona- Pitzer at the net with a 
15-10 margin in team blocking. 

Still, Pomona almost stole the 
second game when it jumped 
out to a 13-7 advantage before 
UCSD won key points following 
some costly Pomona errors. Twenty-
one vital errors proved to be 
Pomona's downfall in the match. 

The Tritons played without 
starting outside hitter Diana 
Klintworth, who was nursing a 
sprained ankle. 

Immediately following the 
match, UCSD head coach Doug 
Dannevik held a ten minute pri-
vate meeting with the team. He 
was obviously upset with the over-
all weak team performance. 

"I was very disappointed with 
our team's play this weekend," 
Dannevik said after the team meet-
ing. "We are not beating the other 
teams with good play, they are 
beating themselves with errors ... 

According to Dannevik, the 

team has improved greatly in three 
weeks but has now reached a pla-
teau. "We are stuck in second 
gear and now must shift into 
third, .. he said. 

The win over Pomona-Pitzer 
(13-7), a team ranked third in the 
region, extended the Tritons win-
ning streak against Division III 
schools to 41 , dating back to last 
season. 

"The team is very young and is 
making youth mistakes," Dan-
nevik said, ". .. I am very, very 
confident we can reach a new pla-
teau. We have young and moti-
vated leaders on this team, ano 
with a 'dammit, get tough' atti-
tude, we will get where we want." 

Obviously, what UCSD wants 
is a third consecutive Division III 
National Championship. 

The Tritons will host unde-
feated Division I opponent Wil-
liam and Mary of Virginia, who 
travel to face UCSD on Friday at 
7 p.m. 

AU Sad1lbian/ GuardiDII 
Laurie Bertanyi's (9) 24 assists Included ones like these ... to people like Becky Palmer, who put down 
four of them for kills. 

AU Sad1lbian/Guardian 
Things are looking up for Ellen Chi and the Tritons, who extended 
their streak over Division III opponents to 41 straight games. 

Triton Sports Clubs 
Still Looking for People 

UCSD currently has eight 
sports clubs which compete 
intercollegiately in their re-
spective sports. These teams 
are a unique blend of compet-
itive teams and recreational 
clubs. Each is officially regis-
tered with the University, but 
receives limited funding. The 
sports clubs all have rigid 
training and competition sche-
dules as well as extensive 

fund raising activities. 
These teams are highly 

competitive and consequently 
perform well in collegiate 
competition. Most teams are 
recruiting through the fall 
quarter and encourage all 
interested people to attend 
their meetings, which are 
being held through the week.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS .. .I'm sorry, but I just can't 

get very excited about anything in the city of 
Philadelphia, induding its football team. I don't care 
if the Eagles have-the home field advantage, and I 
certainly do not know about these comparisons that 
the idiotic East Cost media is making with Philadel-
phia quarterback Randall Cunningham to Joe Nam-
ath or whatever they're doing now. What I do know, 
however, is that the Giants are still one of the top 
teams in football. After last year's early season slide 
which eventually prevented them from reaching the 
postseason, the 3-2 Giants know that they can hardly 
afford to lose this one. And believe me, they won't. 
With Lawrence Taylor now back in action, Phil 
Simms, Joe Morris and company will roll over the 
hapless saps from Philly. Obviously, PHIL wants you

TAKE THE GIANTS 

By JAMES BURKE

Led by the one-two combo of 
junior Teresa Schwaar and fresh-
man Katy Dulock, the Tritons 
dominated Pomona-Pitzer Friday 
by a 4-0 count in women's soccer 
action . The victory extended 
UCSD's record to an unprece-
dented 12-0-1, and ran its shutout 
total on the year up to II . 

The thrashing began in the 
closing ten minutes of the first 
period when Schwaar passed to 
Dulock who quickly converted 
from ten yards out for the first 
goal. On a play almost identical 
to the first with three minutes left 
in the half, Schwaar hit Dulock 
again almost directly in front of 
the goal for another disturbance 
of the net. 

For Dulock, the two goals gave 
her 18 on the season in only 13 
games. Dulock is now only one 
goal behind the school record of 
19, which Schwaar has "no doubt 
will be hers." 

The second half hero proved to 
be junior Heather Mauro, who 
fought through the middle of the 
field to score twice and make the 
final 4-0. 

The four-goal deficit was actu-
ally a great deal worse for th.e 
Pomona-Pitzer age Hens than It 

may seem. As a matter of fact, the 
closest the Sage Hens ever came 
to a shot on goal was a corner 
kick which came with two min·· 
utes left in the first half. 

Needless to say, UCSD goalie 
Julie Freiss suffered from anxiety 
caused by severe lonliness, and 
paced when she got tired of stand-

ing. When the ball would dare to 
venture into Triton territory, co-
captain Susan Kramer would 
contmually slam it back onto the 
Sage Hen side of the field, where 
virtually the entire game was 
played.
