T he UC Online Instruction Pilot Project (OIPP) — launching in January 2012 — will offer 29 interactive courses through its online program. “Digital Music Creation 
and Production” and “Acoustics” — which will be 
taught by music professor Shlomo Dubnov — are 
UCSD’s only planned online course offerings at this 
time.   

In April, a 10-member review committee 
composed of nine UC faculty members and UC 
Office of the President (UCOP) Provost Lawrence 
Pitts selected 29 out of 70 UC faculty proposed 
classes. The 29 selected course proposals are now in 
the implementation phase of the OIPP. 

The courses are designed to be interactive rather 
than podcast and text-based and will utilize various 
online chat features to maintain interaction between 
teaching assistants and students.

“A lot of the faculty is testing the effectiveness 
of different approaches to online teaching,” said 
Vice Provost of Academic Planning, Programs and 

Coordination Daniel Greenstein.
According to the program’s website, the online 

classes will be available for registration alongside 
regular classes. The program is being referred to as a 
‘research project.’ Its initial stage — starting from its 
inception in January until around June 2013 — will 
serve as a research tool to gauge its success. If faculty 
members, students and administrators determine the 
program to be a success, it may be made available to 
more undergraduates and potentially to community 
college students and high school students.

A course catalog for the online program has 
not been released yet. According to the program’s 
website, only some of the 29 classes will be available 
across campuses.

Vice Chair of the UC Academic Senate Robert 
Anderson says that while the Academic Senate 
supports the 29 faculty members who are developing 
the courses, there have been concerns about the 
intended scope of the project. 

The Academic Senate originally received a 
proposal in 2010 for an eleventh UC cyber campus 
that would be entirely electronic. That plan has been 
scaled down due to funding and planning issues. 

“We have had concerns about the planning that 
has gone in to this,” Anderson said.

The cost of the classes has yet to be finalized. UC 
students taking online courses will receive the same 
amount of financial aid as if they were taking regular 
courses. No financial aid is planned for non-UC 
students at this time.

The Academic Senate backed the proposal for the 
program based on the claim that the program would 
raise $30 million from private funds. However, the 
program has only raised $780,000 — courtesy of the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the William 
and Flora Hewlett Foundation — at which point 
the UCOP offered the project an interest-free $6.9 
million loan.  

“I’m not sure that we should be in the business of 
offering online courses to large numbers of non-UC 
students,” Anderson said. “It’s something that needs 
to be thought through carefully.”

UC intends to repay the loan by reserving online 
classes for non-UC students and international 
students, Greenstein said.

BUSINESS 
MINOR NOW 
AVAILABLE TO 
STUDENTS

A business minor is now available to 
all undergraduate students through the 
Rady School of Management.

An information session on the 
business minor will be held on Oct. 
5 by the Rady School and the pre-
business fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi. 
UCSD currently has no business 
major — the most comparable major 
is management science, which has 
an economic focus. Until this year, 
the Rady School of Management only 
offered an accounting minor.

Delta Sigma Pi Vice President of 
Professional Activities Joshua Cheng 
said the minor could allow students 
to explore aspects of business without 
having prerequisites in economics.

“It’s not something for only the econ 
majors or the management science 
majors,” Cheng said. “It’s something 
that’s universal. Everyone can be an 
entrepreneur. Anyone can learn these 
work ethics and business ethics.”

The minor is hoped to further satisfy 
the Rady School of Management’s 
goal to provide business education 
to UCSD students. Students can take 
courses in areas such as management, 
communication, math and psychology. 

“The Rady faculty as well as 
faculty from at least six supporting 
departments believe that students from 
a wide range of academic pursuits 
can benefit from some knowledge 
of business principles and practices,” 
Jordan Clark, Assistant Dean of the 
Rady School of Management, said in 
an email. 

Clark emphasized that Rady is not

UCSD’s Stuart Collection will add its 
18th piece this fall — a 15-by-18-foot 
house called “Fallen Star” by Korean 
artist Do Ho Suh. The structure will be 
placed on top of EBU-1 in the Jacobs 
School of Engineering on Nov. 3.

“It’s probably the most complex 

[piece] we’ve ever undertaken,” 
director of the Stuart Collection Mary 
Beebe said in a Sept. 26 UCSD press 
release. “It is fitting that it will be in 
the residence at the Jacobs School [of 
Engineering], not far from another of 
the Stuart Collection’s engineering feat, 
Tim Hawkinson’s ‘Bear.’” 

“Fallen Star” is designed at one-third 
the scale of a small house in Providence, 

R.I. The house, complete with cement 
slab and steel framing, is currently 
under construction at Warren Mall 
and will be raised to the seventh floor 
of EBU-1. It will be built in to the side 
of the building at an angle with half of 
the house floating in the air. 

Suh — who moved from Seoul, 
South Korea in 1991 to attend the 
Rhode Island School of Design and 
Yale University — is expected to attend 
the hoisting of the house on Nov. 3 at 
Warren Mall. 

The interior decoration of the house 
and yard of “Fallen Star” will be 
decorated by Suh and will be open to

University of California Takes out $6.9 Million Loan to Fund Online System

Private Donations and $90,000 Grant Will Fund Art Installation

Rady Expects 600 Business Minors by 2013, 100 Already Declared 

According to “UC seeks outside 
students to pay for cyber courses,” 
published Sept. 12 in the San Francisco 
Chronicle, Greenstein visited UC study 
centers in Beijing and Shanghai to 
recruit Chinese students. According to 
“UC investing millions in new cyber 
program,” published Sept. 12 in the 
San Francisco Chronicle, Greenstein 
is also in talks with Fidelis, a San 
Francisco organization that offers 
online courses for military personnel.

UC Berkeley political science 
professor and co-chair of the Berkeley 
Faculty Association Wendy Brown is 
not sure about the projected success or 

the intentions of the online education 
program.   Brown disagrees with UC 
Berkeley Dean of Law Christopher 
Edley’s (the program’s leading 
proponent) argument that the project 
will bring money into campuses. 

“So far, high quality online 
education programs have gone 
bankrupt,” Brown said, pointing to 
examples of Columbia University 
and the University of Illinois, where 
failures in online education have been 
attributed to high attrition rates.

Brown is concerned that the UC 
program won’t be able to compete 
with the affordability of online courses 
offered at community colleges. 

“I’m not against online education 

or the use of technology,” Brown 
said. “[But Edley] is taking a different 
approach, a new innovative method. 
This is why they weren’t able to get 
private funding for the project.”

Private companies have not shown 
interest in financially supporting the 
program, Anderson said.

“The foundations expressed interest 
in other types of online education such 
as courses for remedial high school 
education and GED completion,” 
Anderson said. “There was much less 
interest in funding large universities.”

Beebe further stated that maintenance 

will have to be kept on the piece of art 
and encouraged students to volunteer. 

 “I’m nervous about the experience of 
going up there but I think that is part 
of the point,” Beebe said. 

According to Beebe, Suh often 
focuses on themes of displacement and 
the feeling of home in his work. Suh’s 
“Fallen Star” piece also explores the 
cultural meaning of space, especially in 
the context of increased globalization.

Diego’s leading design firms, is heading 

the architecture for this project.

planning on launching a business 
major in the future as it believes that 
business insight coupled with a non-
business major is the ideal combination 
for undergraduates.

“I like to use the example of an art 
student who would like to not only 
paint great works, but also have his 
or her own gallery to display and sell 
those works,” Clark said. “That entails 
knowing how to market the gallery 
and its works, raising and budgeting 
financial resources, managing 
operational details and knowing how 
to work with the public and employees 
just as a start. The same could be said 
of most other career options.”

Rady has been providing 
undergraduate business courses for 

over four years — with over 2,500 
students enrolled in classes last year.

“I have had hundreds of inquires 
from students over those four years 
asking when the business minor 
would be in place,” Clark said. “Strong 
support was also voiced by the advising 
groups at each of the six colleges who 
understand best the educational and 
career interests of our undergraduate 
population since they work directly 
with this group daily.” 

Clark said that the business minor 
was only added this year because 
Rady had to build up faculty and 
administrative resources before it 
could take on the task, explaining that 
launching both minors at once would 
have put a strain on the department. 

Plans for the business minor were 

conceived of around the same time as 
the accounting minor. Rady launched 
its accounting minor two and a half 
years ago, and it is now the largest 
minor on campus with nearly 500 
enrolled students. 

“We had to be assured of the success 
of the accounting minor before we 
could move on to the business minor,” 
Clark said. “To have launched both 
minors at once would have put too big 
a strain on what was then more limited 
resources.”

Currently, 104 students have 
declared a business minor. Rady 
expects to have 500 to 600 business 
minors by the end of June 2013.

QUICK TAKES

Political controversy is once more cooking up at UC Berkeley — this time as a result of 
a College Republican Club bake sale that offers 
discounted prices to women and minorities. 
However, the group’s actions were not in poor 
taste — their primary motive was to satirize 
parts of Senate Bill 185.

SB 185 calls for the UC and CSU systems to 
consider race, gender, ethnicity, national origin 
and other relevant factors in their undergradu-
ate and graduate admissions. If passed, the bill 
would create gray areas that arguably allow for 
abuse in admissions selectivity without liability.  

The bill does not connect these factors to 
the college applicant’s socioeconomic status. In 
theory, it only authorizes the universities to use 
race alone as a factor. The cupcake prices — 
higher for Caucasians and lower for minorities 
— mock the bill’s intentions to demonstrate that 
race cannot be used in substitution for socio-
economic status. 

President of Berkeley’s College Republicans, 
Shawn Lewis stated the group was aware that 
the public display was inherently racist. Their 
main point was that if everyone is to be treated 
as equals, scholarships and admission tickets 
should not be offered at different “prices” for 
different races. 

It’s political satire, it’s button-pushing and it’s 
intentionally racist to drive a point home. If a 
group of college students can fashion a display 
that attracts notice within an endless stream 
of demonstrations, then it has succeeded in its 
purpose.

Speech is Free but Cupcakes Are Not 
College Republicans at the University of California at Berkeley held an inherently 
racist bake sale last Tuesday, where priced baked 
goods were sold at different prices for differ-
ent ethnicities. The primary purpose was to 
mock Senate Bill 185, a bill that would allow 
California’s university systems to consider gender, 
race and ethnicity in admission decisions. While 
the bill is undoubtedly contentious, the bake sale’s 
intended racism went over the top, muddling the 
organizer’s intended message of promoting criti-
cal thought. 

SB 185’s attempt to increase diversity in 
California’s university systems is an obvious 
subject of debate. But simplifying the concept 
of affirmative action into a bake sale with dif-
ferential pricing is not comparable to the issue at 
hand. The mission of SB 185 — which is surely 
debatable — is to make the student bodies of 
California state universities more representative 
of the state’s population in terms of gender, race 
and ethnicity — not to charge students varying 
tuition prices or to impose value judgments on 
others.

A cupcake is not an apt comparison to an 
entire university campus — the entire commu-
nity benefits from a diverse peer group while 
the price of a dessert only affects one person. 
Therefore, the bake sale seems to eliminate the 
most important aspect of the bill — it’s not about 
individuals.

There’s a thin line between comedy and bigot-
ry when it comes to satire, and Berkeley’s College 
Republican Club crossed it with the bake sale.

Satire is Meant to Push ButtonsRacist Protest Crosses Satirical Line
UC Berkeley College Republican Club recently held a satirical “Increase Diversity 
Bake Sale” to discourage the signing of Senate 
Bill 185, which supports the inclusion of race 
as a factor in the California college admissions 
process. 

Baked goods were controversially sold to 
individuals at varying prices based on race and 
gender to illustrate the unfair nature of the bill. 
Regardless of how radical and offensive the 
bake sale may have been, the club was still enti-
tled to its first amendment right of free speech. 

The Supreme Court has recognized that free 
speech rights may only be limited where speech 
“may cause a breach of the peace or cause vio-
lence.” 

According to the Cal republican president 
and various participants, the bake sale was 
peaceful and stirred up discussion amongst 
students without leading to violence. These 
students had every right to legally voice their 
opinions and peacefully make a statement 
about the way the state functions. 

Furthermore, protests of this nature are not 
uncommon on the UC Berkeley campus. The 
free speech movement was started at Berkeley 
nearly 5 decades ago featuring nearly 10,000 
students and police car damage. The selling of 
baked goods pales in comparison to the securi-
ty-filled protests of the university’s past. 

This bake sale at UC Berkeley is justified 
purely on the basis of free speech and the 
media is simply over-publicizing insignificant 
news.

Every night, after Facebook stalk-ing but before Rosetta Stone exercises, I sit in front of my 
laptop and try to find something mean-
ingful to tweet about. I think about the 
news. I think about lunch. I think about 
my 26 entire followers. I stress. Then I 
give up.

That kind of self-induced pres-
sure can wear a girl down, and so for 
years I hated Twitter, the service that’s 
been suggested as a Nobel Peace Prize 
nominee and credited with everything 
from aiding the Green Revolution to 
rescuing an injured woman lost in the 
woods. I’m no social media Luddite, 
but I didn’t see a program that toppled 
regimes. I saw lots of people who love 
Justin Bieber too much.

Thankfully, I had Malcolm Gladwell 
on my side, in the guise of his much-
discussed article “Why the Revolution 
Will Not Be Tweeted.” Gladwell argues 
that activism of the revolution-rab-
bling, Arab Spring kind —  in other 
words, real change —  is high-risk and 
depends on networks of strong ties  
(your real friends). Sure, your Twitter 
followers will keep an eye out for your 
stolen iPhone, but they won’t be flank-
ing you in front of a police squad.

Initially, this seemed about right. 
But after spending a summer in 
Beijing, a few conversations with my 
language tutor made me realize that in 
other countries, Twitter-like services 
are more than their current trending 
topic (which, are, last time I checked, 
Latin Girl in Brazil and Demi Made 
Us Strong.)

Since Twitter is accessible only by 
proxy in China, there’s Weibo, which, 
my tutor said, is the real news source. In 
a country where the media is state-con-
trolled and a woman was arrested for 
tweeting “Change, angry youth!,” eye-
witnesses use Weibo to spread the word 
about everything that won’t be covered 
in the mainstream media.  When Liu 
Xiaobo won the Nobel Prize against 
the wishes of the Chinese government, 
all variations of his name were blocked 
by the censors. The Chinese turned 
to Twitter. In the U.S., citizens mostly 
leave the reporting to the papers, but in 
China, Twitter-like services help take 
the place of our free press. 

Back in America, the service has 
been used to inaugurate a new kind 
of cyberactivism. Last year, feminist 
Sady Doyle launched a Twitter pro-
test in response to director   Michael 
Moore’s comments blaming the rape 
victim in the case of WikiLeaks found-
er Julian Assange’s extradition. Doyle 
and her followers bombarded Moore 
with tweets, calling for him to retract 
his statement. She was harassed, her 
personal information made public and 
even stalked — but Moore listened, and 
he responded. 

Digital evangelists heralding 
Twitter as a dictator-killer aren’t all 
correct, but neither are the people 
(read: myself) who hate Twitter mostly 
because they’re not so great at using 
it. Gladwell may be right that Twitter

An Online Education
Online coursework may be cost efficient for the UC system, but concerns about quality control and 

sustainability must be addressed before flipping the switch.

BY ALEKS LEVIN • STAFF WRITER

After wading through the shallow waters of online extension courses, the University of California is ready to make the leap into the deep end, begin-
ning with the UC Online Instruction Pilot Project in January 
2012. The project plans to offer up to 29 for-credit courses 
with the long-term end goal of expanding online instruction, 
allowing students to earn a UC degree exclusively online. 
The University of California’s planned large-scale entry into 
online education is an acknowledgement of online educa-
tion’s potential merit, though its cost effectiveness is tem-
pered by administrative fears of educational quality control 
and financial sustainability. 

The cost-effectiveness of online programs versus tra-
ditional education is a definite plus in the eyes of the UC 
administration. In an interview with the Sacramento Bee, 
Dean of Berkeley School of Law and program creator 
Christopher Edley believes that the “bricks-and-mortar 
model” is no longer sustainable due to the decrease in state 
funding and the increase in demand for education — factors 
that make it more difficult to provide access to a UC quality 
education. Provost and Executive Vice President Lawrence 
Pitts emphasized the program’s ability to accommodate 
underrepresented students whose job and family roles might 
not allow them to be physically present and benefit from an 
education on a UC campus. 

Overall, online courses are cheaper than traditional 
courses, but good online courses require significant finan-
cial resources and time, so whether the UC pilot program 
can succeed financially remains to be seen. Similarly priced 

ventures have proven unfruitful in the past. Inside Higher 
Education described how the University of Illinois Global 
Campus “crashed and burned” in 2009 after it failed to attract 
a global audience — becoming a proverbial “cash cow.” 

Though the University of California Office of the 
President has shown support by giving a $6.9-million inter-
est-free loan to the project, private investors and grants have 
only contributed a single $748,000 grant from the Bill and 
Melinda Gates foundation — far short of an expected $6 mil-
lion in private revenue. 

There is also the question of whether students will be 
interested in UC online courses, considering the plethora 
of cheaper, readily available online classes in community 
colleges. According to Vice-Provost Daniel Greenstein, the 
program plans to pay back the UCOP loan and increase stu-
dent interest by selling 5,000 of the 7,000 projected spots to 
out-of-state students and students in China. A heavy reliance 
on financial support from non-Californian students begs the 
question of whether this will be utilized for California stu-
dents or will end up being just another budget stopgap. 

Additionally, there was a poor show of support for an 
online program among UC faculty. Only 70 UC professors 
out of thousands submitted proposals by December 2010 to 
teach a course, even with a promise of $30,000 in develop-
ment funds for each course. UC Davis law professor and 
Vice Chair of the statewide Academic Senate Dan Simmons 
questioned the notion that educational quality would remain 
uncompromising in the move to online education. Simmons 
flatly stated that, “People have created a set of expectations

about the potential for online education that is not really 
there.” The UC system needs to win its faculty over with 
the program, lest it go the way of the Global Campus.

While these problems do exist, there is definite demand 
for online classes. Enrollment for online classes increased 
from 700,000 in 1998 to 5 million in 2007. On the other 
hand, the success rate for students in online courses is 
about 50 percent, while the success rate for face-to-face 
classes is 70- to- 75-percent. Reasons for the low success 
rate should be addressed by the Pilot Program, as should 
issues such as a lack of physical presence, accountability 
and even instructors. 

Some of these issues are solved by hybrid classes, which 
use components of in-person and online classes and main-
tain steady success rates. Part of the reason for stability 
in hybrid courses is a face-to-face factor — students can 
attend office hours and interact in discussions.

To address the high failure rates, some professors such 

as Associate Professor at Georgia Perimeter College Rob 
Jenkins believe that schools should put students through 
an online compatibility test before enrollment to see if they 
would work well under such an environment.

It is arguable that some majors are better suited for an 
online forum than others. For instance, science classes and 
classes in the humanities are markedly different in both 
structure and testing. While there have been technological 
measures created to combat cheating for papers in humani-
ties classes, no one has fully taken on the challenge of 
addressing potential cheating on science and math-based 
exams. A lack of student oversight could be detrimental to 
the learning process and degrade the quality of instruction.

There is no denying the potential usefulness of an 
online component in education if done properly. All that 
remains to be seen is if the UC system is indeed able to 
address many concerns surrounding online education this 
coming January.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 03,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

LINEAR SPEECH By Robert Kim 

Dear Editor,
We are in a revolutionary time.
Mass occupations in Tunisia and 

Egypt led to the fall of U.S.-supported 
decades-long dictators.

In nine months, these actions 
have swept through the Arab world 
to Europe to Madison and Wall Street 
and now. 117 other U.S. Cities, includ-
ing 16 cities in California and back 
across the world to Tijuana, Tokyo 
and throughout Europe.

The fightback is global because the 
cutbacks are global.

Following an economic crisis that 
created the greatest transfer of wealth 
from the 99 percent to the richest 1 
percent in history, UCSD students and 
working-class Americans are told we 
need to “share the cuts” or what the 
ruling class calls “austerity.” 

Enough is enough! Make Wall 
Street pay for their crisis, not the 
students and workers! Let’s fight 
together this fall for future 
students, staff and ourselves!

Every Monday at 8 p.m. in SSB 
101, UCSD’s Public Education 
Coalition will meet. We call on all 
community members, faculty, stu-
dents, workers and their unions and 
organizations to join us.

We’re building solidarity for 
actions from Occupy San Diego on 
Oct. 7 to the International Day of 
Action Against Austerity on the 10th 
Anniversary of the U.S. invasion of 
Afghanistan on Oct. 15 where people 
will take the streets to express outrage 
at how our rights are being under-
mined by the alliance between politi-
cians and big corporations, and their 
commitment to make workers pay 
for their wars and the economic crisis 
they created.

The global fightback does not 
happen in a vacuum, so we combine 

analysis, theory and history at our 
meetings and at a Nov. 12 Regional 
Conference on “Marxism and the 
Fight Against Austerity: Why the 
Working Class Can Change Society.”

As record numbers of Americans 
are struggling to find work, housing 
and healthcare, the largest corpora-
tions are experiencing record-break-
ing profits and CEOs are receiving 
record-breaking bonuses. As public 
education is slashed, the U.S. military 
has spent over 1.2 trillion in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, 3 billion is going annu-
ally to military aid for Israel and its 
illegal occupation of Palestine and 
predator drones (designed at UCSD 
with public subsidies) are being used 
to terrorize Pakistanis, Somalis, and a 
host of other countries, including U.S. 
citizens abroad.

All of this while the Regents 
has a multi-year plan for tuition 
increases that will have irreversible 
impact for the UC’s public mission. 
Undergraduate and graduate tuition 
increased 67 percent since 2009, rais-
ing the price of a UC undergraduate 
education above $12,000. With the 
new plan, undergraduate tuition could 
reach $22,000 in 2016!

Both the California legislature 
and the UC Regents want to balance 
the budget. on the backs of students, 
instead of increasing the taxes on the 
rich and slashing the thick layers of 
high-paid UC administrators.

pairs venerable folk elements with far-flung sounds, and the results feel both 
strangely familiar and unlike anything anybody's ever heard before. To put it another

The championship pairing of West and Sousa have earned 
a spot at the ITA Small College National Championships, to 
take place Oct. 13-16 at the Copeland-Cox Tennis Center in 
Mobile, Alabama.

Willing says the pair will be working hard in preparation 
for the tournament.

“We go to Irvine for an invitation where we will be facing 
extremely high competition,” Willing said. “We will get in 
there and try and work on some specific things, and hopefully 
that tough competition and a couple weeks of practice will 
give us a little help before we get into the tournament.”

The men’s tennis team will return to the court this week-
end, Friday Oct. 7 - Oct. 9, at the UC Irvine Invitational.

already beaten UCSD twice this season.
The Tritons took a 2-0 lead into the second quarter, which 

they extended by recording four more goals in the third 
quarter. 

In the fourth quarter Loyola went on a 3-2 run, but with a 
five-point lead, the Tritons secured the win.

UCSD played its last game of the tournament against No. 9 
UC Davis, narrowly defeating the Aggies 11-10.

In a back-and-forth contest, the Tritons went up 4-3 in the 
first quarter, while the two teams remained deadlocked at the 
end of the first half.

With four minutes remaining in the third quarter, sopho-
more Josh Stiling scored his second goal of the game to put the 
Tritons ahead 8-6, while senior William Brown put two more 
away before the end of the period to push the game to 10-8. 

With one last push in the fourth quarter, UC Davis’ Russell 
Hampton scored two consecutive goals, but UCSD held onto 
the lead to take the game.

The Tritons take ninth place in the 16-team tournament 
for the second year in a row.

UCSD’s next match is slated for Sunday, Oct. 9 at noon 
against Cal – who took first place in the SoCal tournament 
this weekend.

Tritons Split Conference Away Matches

The women’s volleyball team beat bottom of the conference Humboldt State in straight sets, before dropping to top of the conference Sonoma State 3-1 on Saturday, Oct. 1.

The women’s volleyball team kicked off its road trip up north on Friday with a game against Humboldt State. 
Despite suffering its first loss of the sea-
son against Chico State last week, UCSD 
rebounded against the Lumberjacks beating 
Humboldt in straight sets.

For the sixth time this season, UCSD 
held opponents to under a .100 attack per-
centage, with Humboldt — 5-8 overall and 
2-7 in the CCAA — hitting a mere .065 for 
the match.

UCSD middles junior Julia Freidenberg 
and freshman Lauren Demos both had a 
hand in the success of the Triton defense, 
with four blocks combined in the game.

The Tritons recorded 44 kills, as well as 
only 15 errors in 116 attempts for the match.

Senior outside hitter Katie Condon 
totaled 10 kills, while senior setter Roxanne 
Brunsting achieved her eighth double-dou-
ble of the season with 16 assists and 15 digs.

“I was pleased by the way we played,” 
head coach Ricci Luyties said. “We were 
definitely focused and ready to play that 
match, and I think we played pretty well.”

On Saturday, the Tritons were upset 3-1 
by the Sonoma State Seawolves. The loss 
dropped the team to 10-2 overall and 6-2 in 
the CCAA, where UCSD sits in fourth place.

UCSD hit a paltry .162 — their second-
lowest percentage of the season — while the 
Seawolves hit a .275, along with 59 kills and 
17 errors in 153 attacks.

“The ball control, serving and passing 
was won by them, and that makes a big dif-
ference in volleyball,” said Luyties. “I think 
that was the main difference in the match.”

The Tritons began the match with a 0.31 
hitting percentage, resulting in an easy set 
won 25-31 by the Seawolves. 

The Tritons pulled closer but narrowly 
dropped the second set 25-23, and then took 
the third set 19-25. Although the Tritons 

dug themselves out of the deficit by forcing 
the fourth set, the Seawolves put it away at 
25-18.

Condon and Brunsting posted big num-
bers — with Condon picking up her fourth 
double-double of the season with 11 kills 
and 12 digs and Brunsting recording a 
match-high of 18 digs — though it wasn’t 
enough to pull out the win.

The Tritons come back home this 
Wednesday, Oct. 5 to face undefeated 13-0 
Cal State San Bernardino at 7 p.m. 

“We know that we have to keep working 
hard and that the games are all going to be 
tough, and every one we’re going to play in 
our conference is very good. We’re just try-
ing to get better everyday, and I think if we

After defeating the Grand Canyon duo of Stephan Murray and Patrice Giraldi 8-4 in the semifinal bout, the UCSD 
doubles team of Austin West and Devon Sousa 
took down the Grand Canyon pairing of Ahmed 
Saleem and Bastien Tonus 8-2 to win the regional 
championships at the USTA/Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association on Saturday, Oct. 1.

Three UCSD doubles teams and four singles 
competitors qualified for the ITA Regionals, begin-
ning the tournament on Wednesday, Sept. 28. 

In the first round of the tournament, the Triton 
doubles team of Andrew Malkozsak and Maxence 
Dutreix were defeated 8-4 by Sonomas David 
Hutton and Greg Eckstadt, while UCSD duo Max 
Jiganti and Trevor Dell had a stronger showing, 
beating Sonoma State pair Garret Gooch and 
Robert Henry 8-1.

Jiganti and Dell were met with UCSD opposi-
tion in the quarterfinals, dropping the game to 
West and Sousa 8-5  the pair that would take the 
tournament championship after beating Grand 
Canyon doubles teams in the semifinal and final 
rounds.

[West and Sousa] just played well, assistant 
coach Timmer Willing said. We had to play back-
to-back against two Grand Canyon teams that 
are very competitive and our guys just physically 
played really well and were mentally just up and 
ready for the challenge.

In the singles competition, the Tritons did not 
fair as well.

Seven Tritons qualified for the second round 
of singles play but were whittled down to four by 
the quarterfinal round, until only sophomore Max 
Jiganti stood in the semifinals for UCSD.

Jiganti faced off against Grand Canyons 
Ahmed Saleem in a hard-fought three-set battle, 
winning 6-2, 4-6 and 10-8. 

In the same day, Jiganti defeated Stephan 
Murray of Grand Canyon in straight sets, 6-2 and 
7-6, to take the semifinal win.

In the tournament decider Jiganti faced 
Brigham Young University-Hawaiis Yevhen 
Zakharov, losing in straight sets.

[Jiganti] went down early, but was able to pull 
out the match against Grand Canyon and did the 
same thing against BYU in the finals, said Willing.

The No. 12 UCSD mens water polo team went away with a record 3-1 in this weekends SoCal Tournament, hosted by Cal State Long Beach, 
finishing ninth in the 16-team tournament.

The Tritons began the tournament on Saturday 
against UC Santa Barbara. The No. 8 Gauchos rolled 
off the first five goals in the match before the Tritons 
could muster a response. With three minutes remain-
ing, UCSD managed to take two back before the end 
of the period. At the start of the second the Gauchos 
scored another two quick goals, but the Tritons put 
away two more to keep the match within four after 
the first half.

To start the second half, senior Graham Saber 
scored his fourth goal to bring the Tritons to within 
three, but it was the closest the Tritons would come, 
as the Gauchos scored the next two and held control 
of the game for the remainder of the quarter. 

Senior Lance Curtiss scored a goal in the final 
quarter with just over seven minutes remaining, with 
the game ending 14-8 in favor of the Gauchos.

After dropping its opening match, UCSD fell into 
the losers bracket of the SoCal Tournament. 

In their second match, the Tritons squared off 
against Air Force Academy, a team that the Tritons 
have already defeated 9-4 at home earlier in the year.

The Tritons stormed out to a 2-0 lead, but UCSD 
gave up five of the next six goals and were looking at 
a 5-3 deficit early in the game. 

The Tritons managed to dig themselves out of the 
hole to tie the game at 7-7 at halftime. Air Force took 
a two-goal lead with a quarter left to play.

With the clock winding down, Saber scored. 
The goal brought the Tritons to within one, as they 
mounted their comeback. With 50 seconds left junior 
John Butler scored to tie the match. 50 seconds later, 
with just five seconds left to play, Saber scored his 
fourth goal of the quarter to take the game.

In the second day of the tournament, the Tritons 
faced No. 11 Loyola Marymount  a squad that had
