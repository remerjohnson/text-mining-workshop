-Constitution of the State of 
California: Article IX, Section 9 

With these words, enormous 
power of the Regents of the 
University of California was 
constitutionally guaranteed in 
1918. Both the University and 
the first Board of Regents were 
created in 1868, but the board's 
status as a constitutional 
corporation that owns and rules 
the University was not confirmed 
until fi fty years later. Today the 
twenty-two men and wornen who 
are the Regents represent a 
cross-section of the wealthiest 

and most powerful people in the 
state. Appointed by the Governor 
and approved by the California 
Senate, the Regents may not be 
removed from office, and remain 
on the job umil t\ley have 
completed thei r 12 year term, 
resigned, or died. 

While muc It of the day-to-day 
responsibility of running a 
University hac;; been shifted to 
the SystemWIde Administration 
headed by University President 
David P. Gardner and the 
individual campus 
administrations headed by the 
various Chancellors, a great deal 
of important work is done by the 
Regents. One of the most

complete definitions of the 
Regents' responsibilitites is found 
in the New Indicator CollectIve's 
Disorientation Manual, nd reads, 
"the promotion of the purpo e 
and progress of the institution 
according to the dictates laid 
down in the b~sic legal 
document of the UniverSity, and 
the development of a plan which 
will serve as a vehicle in 
implementing the basic 
expectations and philosophy of 
that document, the selection of 
chief administrative officers 
(presidents) and the 
determination of the length and 
terms of their contracts, acting as 
a court of last resort in crisis 
situations not resolvable by the 
Administration alone, control 
and distribution of financial 
resources and the guardian 

activity of ensuring tht the 
University maintains its 
academic credibility and 
prestige." 

The powers given to the 
Regents to fulfill these 
responsibilities include the 
ability to obtain, either through 
"purchase or by donation, or gift, 
complimentary or otheIWise, or 
in 'any other manner, without 
restriction, aU real and personal 
property for the benefit of the 
university or incidentally to its 
conduct," as stated in Article IX, 
Section 9 of the California 
Constitution. Essentially, the 
Regents are given complete 
power, both over the property 
belonging to the UniverSity of 
California and the people who 
work for it. 

During the earliest years of the 
university'S existence, the Board 
of Regents played a very invol 
role , concerning themselves in 
virtually all the facets of running 
an educational institution. Verne 
A. Stadtman, the official 
university historian, writes that 
ten standing committees were 
created in 1868: "finance and 
accounts; grounds and buildings; 
library; building; supplies; 
instruction; agricultural college 
lands; endowments; degrees; and 
annual reports." A time went 
the number of committees 
shrank to six, and they presently 
number seven.

UClA student editor 
under fire 

A decision was made by the 
ASUCLA Communication Board 
Feb. 12 to suspend the editor-in-
chtef of the Daily Bruin after he 
allowed a cartoon to be printed 
that portrayed affirmative action 
in a negattve light. 

The decision was rescinded 
the following day because the 
board failed 10 follow proper 
gnevance procedures in handling 
the case. 

The four panel cartoon 
depicted a rooster being asked 
by a student how he got imo 
UCLA The rooster replied , 
"affirmative action ." 

The editorial section of the 
Daily Bruin states that the paper 
complies with the 

Communication Board's policy 
prohibiting the publication of 
articles that perpetuate 
derogatory cultural or ethnic 
stereotypes. 

Ron Bell, editor-in-chief. said 
that the amount of public outcry 
is an indicator of the high level 
of racial tension on the UCLA 
campus. 

The board will convene in a 
closed session March 5 to decide 
whether to dismiss, suspend, or 
take no acnon agatnst Bell. 

Bell thinks It is highly unlikely 
that the board will dectde to 
suspend him again . .Jf the board 
decides to dismiss him, Bell said 
he will take legal action. 

In response to thts tssue, the 
newspaper has adopted a new 
policy that requIres all cartoons 
to gam the approval of an 
edltonal board. 
Engineering depattment

The engineering department

The capsule wiU include such

quantum deteclOr of arsenic-
doped silicon, refraclOry-coated 
nu lear fue l particles, and various 
state-of-the-art electronics 
donated by high-tech business

Originally, the capusule was to 
be buried at the buildi ng's 
groundbrcaking ceremonies in 
October 1986; however, the 
contraclOr decided to bury the

been completed instead. 

The capsule is scheduled 10 be

UClA to receive $750 
million art collection 

UCLA will receive the largest 
gift ever made 10 a university 

when orton Simon donates his 
~750 million art collection to the 
school. 

The agreement berween the 
university and Simon has not 
been formally drafted; 
however, discussions have been 
underway for some time. 

UCLA Chancellor Charles E. 
Young said the addition of 
Simon's collection of Old Master, 
classic modem and rare Asian 
art would make UCLA the home 
of the greatest university-based 
art collection in the world. 

The collection currently reside 
in the Norton Simon Museum in 
Pasadena. The majority of the 
collection will remain in the . 
museum although it will be 
admtnlstered by UCLA. and the 
present boards of both the 
museum and the orton Stmon 
foundation. 

Simon's collection includes 
such works as Rembrandt's 
pomait of his son , Ti tus; 
Raphael's "Madonna and Child

students," and that because they 
did permit MacCrone to take

Nevertheless, on Feb. 11 , 
1987, the Muir College Council 
(MCC) reappointed MacCrone as 
their Senior Senator on the 
Council. They argued in a memo 
to the council that they "have 
reviewed the A.S. Constitution

Board did not have the power to 
remove one of our college's 
representatives."

their individual colleges, and 
therefore are not elected officers 
of the ASUCSD, which they sit 
on, and which is a campuswide 
body. Article HI, Section E of the 
AS. Constitution states that "Any 
elected officer of the ASUCSD 
may be removed from office after 
a hearing from the Judicial 
Board ... " so, by the MCCs 
logic, MacCrone is therfore 
immune from removal from the 
AS. Council by the Judicial 

. Board. 

Earhart's response was swift. 
On Feb, 13 he sent a note to the 

. MCC in which he explained the 
Judicial Board's position and 
chastised the council for 
reinstating MacCrone to the AS. 
Council. His memo began, ·Your 
decision to reinstate Greg 

MacCrone grratly disturbed the 
Judicial Board. Gr~g MacCrone 
was tried within a judicial systtm 
that was set up by the students 
as a collective group , He was 
found guilty by this process." He 
concluded by pronouncing that 
MCC's "reinstatement of Greg 
MacCrone is hereby rendered 
void ." 

A.5. President Riley, who 
described his position in the 
whole affair as "awkward , these 
guys (MCC and MacCrone) are 
on one side, and these (A.s. 
judicial Board) are on the other," 
sent a memo on feb. 20 to 
Earhart asking for the Board to 
rule on the reappointment of 
MacCrone as Muir Senior 
Senator. 

Three days later, on the Feb. 
23, the Judicial Board issued a 
Statement of Clarification (SOC) 
regarding their ruling, the MCC's

response, and their answer to 
that response . 

The SOC struc k down the 
MCCs argument that senators 
are not elected officers of the 
ASUCSD by pointing out that all 
the officers of the A.5. Council , 
senators included, are listed 
under Article III of the A.S. 
Consititution, which is entitled 
"Officers of the ASUCSD." This 
straightforward deduction is in 
tum bolstered by rwo other 
arguments. 

First , Article IV, Section E, 
paragraph 1 states: "All decisions 
of the ASUCSD Jud icial Board 
shall be final unless reviewed by 
the board itself." This the board 
did , in late January, and once 
again they found MacCrone 
guilty.

Another ptece of evidence 
MacCrone introduced was that 
Greg Hom, A.S. Chair, was 
indeed sick at the time 
MacCrone assumed his chair, 
therefore under both Robert's 
Rules and the AS. Bylaws, 
MacCrone was correct in 
assuming the Chair in Hom's 
absence. 

After the board's decision to 
stick by its original ruling, 
MacCrone gave up on attempting 
to "work it out through student 
channels, namely the

Schnaubelt slammed 
Editor: 

Well it seems that you are 
again the victim of unabashed 
criticism by an ignorant 
butthead. In Monday's edition, 
Christopher Schnaubelr accused 
you of liberalizing too much with 
regards to Nicaragua. He states 
numerous actions by the 
Sandinistas that are illegal and 
are worthy of an upscaled war 
on them by the United States. 
But Mr. Schnaubelt's statements 
are , if not lies, out of date and 
similar to the type of 
propoganda Reagan would have 
us believe. He complains, for 
example, of "the murder and 
forced relocation of Miskito 
Indians." The Sandinistas did 
commit acts against the Miskitos, 
but they did not include murder 
and they were ended years ago. 
The governfnent has since been 
avidly trying to amend relanons 
but they have been thwarted by 
the CIA who has been 
propagating the Indians and 
financing them to fight the 
government. He also states that 
the government called for "the 
prohibition of an Independent 
press." The press he IS refering 
to is one newspaper, La Prensa, 
that was closed down because of 
its use of outright disinformation 
tactics, calling for the ove rthrow 
of the government during a time 
of war, and the fact that it was 

given 5100 ,000 from the U.S. 
government to help in its war on 
the country. This is a small bm 
Widely used fact that right-
wingers like Schnaubelt use to 
support the contras. But the 
problem to their argument is that 
there is a paper, the privately 
owned El Nuevo Diario, that 
frequently attacks instances of 
government mismanagement. 
Space is also provided regularly 
in the official newspaper, 
Banicada, for popular, often 
raucous, complaints. And the 
electronic media have provided 
an open forum for unrehearsed 
public corn plaints, broadcast live. 
There is just no proof that the 
Sandinistas suppress the public 
or the media. In fact, the 
Nicaraguans have an equal, if not 
better, censorship record than 
us. 

Mr. Schnaubelt also claimed 
that the Nicaraguan people are 
as oppressed under the 
Sandinistas as they were under 
Somoza. Well, I bet Mr. know-it-
all hasn't traveled to the country 
he is denouncing and has no 
intention to because if he 'did he 
would find that the people are 
not as oppressed as he said they 
are. In fact, they are ecstatic with 
the regime. The country has 
provided unprecendented 
personal. religiOUS, and political 
freedom, distributed land , 
expanded agriculture . almost

Editor's note 
Column in a box 

What the hell ... who cares? 
Well , everyone at UCSD is either a left- or 

right-winger. At least that's what we read aU the 
time. I don't know about you, but I'm getting just 
a little tired of both sides claiming to have the 
majority on their side . 

Because I'm part of that majority. 
When it comes right down to it, we all know 

damn good and well what side the majority is 
on . We're on no side. We're JUSt a bunch of 
apathetic people who wan~ to study and be left 
alone to scam on cute girls (and guys) at Cluster. 
The only issue that affects us is the T.G. alcohol 
policy. That's all. Nothing else. 

Isn't it nice to know that we don't have a care 
in the world when it comes to what goes on here 
at school? 

A new constitution? Big deal. We didn't even 
know there was an old one, let alone what it 
said. If the "left-wingers" want to get together 
and make a new one, what the hell? Let 'em. 

If the A.S. Council wants to stop them, hey, 
that's okay too. 

Because I'm the apathetic student. 
And a lot of trees are being cut down in order 

to construct new buildings. I hate to say it, but 
progress is progress. If they can find a way to do 
it without hurting the trees, more power to them. 
If not, oh well. Concrete ain't such a bad thing to 
live with , is it? 

A football team? Do I want to spend six dollars 
and fifty cents on it every quarter? Gee, that's a 
heavy question. Well , it has its pro's and con's. 

Let the administration decide. It's much roo 
trivial 9f an issue to disturb my studies with. 

And what's all the fuss about the Stuart 
Collection? We've got Stonehenge to sit on during 
lunch on nice days. And that net-thingie " " So 
what if nobody knows what it is? If they want to 
spend millions of dollars on art, that's cool with 
me. 

Because I'm the apathetic student. 
Alternative media? Do they need money? I pay 

my fees. I think I've contributed enough, thank 
you. Besides, the school gets so much money 
from our parking permits, they should be able to 
give an adequate amount of money to alternative

give lots of money to the Koala. It's funny. 

And Nicaragua. Who needs an organized

On the other hand, if people want to protest and

as long as they don't disturb my Frisbee game on

Because I'm the apathetic student.

when it comes right down to it, we don't give a

dropped the infant mortality rate 
[0 8%, and the illiteracy rate 
from 51.3% to 12%. UNE CO 
declared Nicaragua a model 
nation due to its literacy 
program, bUt due to the contras, 
over 150 teachers have been 
kidnapped or murdered , since 
the rebels single out adult 
education workers in rural areas. 
But the people are still happy. 

. They know that the CO ntro do 
not have the internal support 
they need to win and they will 

. soon lose the external futtding 
that keeps their war aOoat. In the 
country's first democratic 
election in 1984, which 
thousands of international 
countries vouched for, the 
Sandinistas naturally dominated. 
But there (Ire also a total of seven 
political parties in the country's 
new national assembly which 
goes to show that the ele tions 
were not a puppet of the 
government. 

Ch ristopher also criticized the 
left for "Ignoring the atrocities of 
leftist regimes danCing off [0 
doom some other country, such 
as El Salvador or Honduras to 
Marxist rule." He is making a 
huge genernlization out of the 
crimes of a few leftist countries. 
Yes, Virginia, the USSR has 
committed some crimes in the 
past. But what about our 
"perfect" puppet countries? EI 
Salvador is probably the worst 
human rights violator of them all. 
In 1983 , the Legal Aid office of 
the Catholic archdiocese of San 
Salvador put the number of 
noncombatant citizen death by 
military or paramilitary 
organizations at 40 ,000 since 
1979. That's one Out of 125 
people dead in only four years! 
This is a country that has been 
given over $1 billion in 
economic aid and over $700 
million in military aid by the 
United States. And good old 
Chris the Indian protector 
neglected to mention that 
Honduras has killed, jailed, and 
tortured thousands of Indians, 
who rnake up half the 
popuhition. Millions of people 
,have been forced to flee the 
country due to state terrorism. I 
guess the Miskitos are the only 
Indians that get his sympathy 
because they are in a country 
tliat is not financed by US 
corporations. If he thinks things 
will be bad under leitist rule he 
'should open his eyes and see 
how bad it is under "democratic" 
rule . It is sad to think that 
Reagan's disinformation has 
infiltrated and affected the youth 
of our country. If we don't do 
something about it, we might 
find ourselves trapped in a war 
to preserve the' interests of 

. American corporations, on our 
way to nuclear armageddon for 
the right to exploit and abuse 
the workers of the world.

Regents 
Continued from ~lte 1 
Regents appOlntcd offlccrs, who 
are not themselves Regcnts, and 
which in 1868 included a 
preSident, treasurer and 
secretary. Today there IS, in 
addlllon lO tho c po mons, a 
chairman of the board . vicc 
chairman of the board , and a 
general counsel (legal adviser) . 
According lO Stadtman, the 
secreta!)' of the Regents' wlde-
ranging respon iblhnes Included 
not onl>' doing all the 
bookkeeping, corresponding, 
(acn ng as secreta!)' for the 
AcademiC enate) and being 
supervisor of grounds, but also 
bemg solely "responSible for 
collecting, from all pans of the 
world , plants and seed that 
might be tested In California 
climate and soi1." Today the 
secretary works solely as the 
secreta!) for the Regents, and the 
other JObs are handled by 
specialists in those fields . 

As the university grew, the 
Regents removed themselves 
from day lO day business and 
concerned themselves with more 
long ranging aspects, problems 
and plans. In as late as 190 I, 
Stadtman writes, "the Regents 
gave tndlvidual anention to each 
request from alumm for 
replacement of a defective, lost, 
stolen or burned diploma." Such 
attention lO detail rapidly 
became an impossibihty, and the 
Regents had begun lO relax their 
absolute grip on the University in 
the 1880s. Writes Stadtman, "The 
first Significant delegation of 
authonty lO the President of the 
university was made m 1899 as a 
condition of Benjamin Ide 
Wheeler's acceptance of the 
Presidency. Wheeler demanded 
and was granted authority to 
ininate all appOintments, 
promotions, and dismissals of 
faculty members." 

David Hoffman, a political 
science major at UCLA, is thiS 
year's Student Regent. His term 
began in July of 1986, and he 
began attending the Regents' 
meetings as a voting member in 
November of the same year. 
When asked about the value of 

attend every meeting 01 the 
board si nce at least last July, 
sc nding represe ntatives instead. 
Lt. Governor Mc arthy. on the 
other hand, attends regularly but 
"says little" Honig, the 
uperintendent of Public 

Instruction, rarely shows up but 
has a lot 10 say when he docs, 
and Governor DeukmeJian had 
attended twice, once spending 
most of the time talking about 
the divestmcnt issue. 

Deukmejian and the Board oj Regents in 1984. 

In his somewhat radical 1974 
book, Who Rules the Ulliver ities? 
David Smith argues that the 
Rcgents arc an extremely 
homogenous group of men and 
women who represent vtrlually 
nobod y in ci ther American 
society in general or California 
society in particular, and belong . 
to "an American ruling class .. 
which rules in its own Interest." 
In one pan of his book, Smith 
documents the enormous, 
interwoven web of social, 
business, and political 
connections that link the Regents 
with the wealthy and powerful in 
America, indeed making them a 
pan of that very upper crust. 
After documenting over the 
course of several pages the 
various boards of directors , 
political organizations, and social 
clubs that the Regents (at the 
time, though the times have 
hardly changed) si t on or belong 
10, Smith concludes: "The 
Regents, then are people not 

the Student Regent position, 
Hoffman said that "I feel that it 
is a job worth having I am able 
10 act as a mediator between the 
students and the board and also 
much more." When asked if he 
felt as though he was treated as 
an equal by the Other Regents, 
Hoffman replied, 'Yes, and no. 
While I never lacked the powers 
of an appointed Regent, the 
Regents pay a lOt of respect to 
authority and expenise, and I'm 
not in a field which applies 10 
the business of the board ." 

I\levertheless, Hoffman felt he 
had "excellent tools" with which 
lO achieve his goals, and felt he 
"accomphshed a lot more" than 
he had hoped to when he first 
started the job. One of his effons 
involves trying to change order 
105.1 of the Bylaws and Standing 
Orders of the Regents, which 
describes the make up of the 
systemwide Academic Senate . At 
the present time, the Senate is 
comprised of selected faculty 
members, staff and 
administrative o1ficers. No 
students belong to the Senate, 
whose primary role IS to 
authorize and supervise the 
courses and curriculum offered at 
nearly all University of California 

departments. colleges, schools 
and graduate divisions. Hoffman 
wished to change the bylaws so 
that students would be included. 

According lO Hoffman, the 
Regents tend lO concern 
themselves with affairs that fall 
Within the realm of their own 
expemse. and worry less about 
areas with which they are 
unfamiliar. "Finance is the area 
where the greatest number of 
Regents are involved," said 
Hoffman, and indeed, finance is 
the subject which most of the 
committees deal with . One 
committee deals with education, 
and there are no committees that 
directly address the concerns of 
faculty, staff, or students. 
Hoffman feels, however, that "the 
presence of a student Regent 
gives the Regents a sense of 
responsib ility and my comments 
remind the Regents of the 

~tudent interests." He does, 
however, desire the formation of 
an "advisory body of students 
with expenise on individual 
matters" which deals directly 
with the Regents. This body 
would give students with special 
skills the opportun ity 10 use 
them in promoting student 
interests.

In addition 10 twenty-two 
AppOinted Regents, there are 
seven Regents Ex Officio, two 
Regents-Designate, a Student 
Regent, and two Faculty 
Representatives who sit on the 
board . The Ex Officio Regents 
Include George Deukmeji ,m, the 
Governor of California; Leo T. 
McCanhy, the Lieutenant 
Govemor of Cali fornia; Willie L. 
Brown ,Jr., the Speaker of the

Hutchinson and James T oledano, 
President and Vice PreSident, 
respectively, of the Alumm 
Association of the UniveTSlty of 
California; and David Pierpont 
Gardner, President of the 
University of California. 

An interesting piece of 
information on one of the Ex 
Officio Regents was given by 
Hoffman , as well. Recently, Willie 
Brown announced his desire for 
a tuition-free University of 
Callfornia , which may lead one 
to believe that the Speaker 
regularly attends the mee tings of 
the board in order to stay 
current on what is happening in 
the UniverSity. In fact, says 
Hoffman , Brown has fa iled 10 

only of great wealth but of great 
powe r socially, economically and 
politically." 

The board's seven standing 
co mm!ttces include at least five 
Regents as members of each one, 
and eat no more than 12 at the 
present time ( the number 
allowed will decrease slightly in 
the future). Any Regent may 
attend a meeting of any 
committee, includi ng one which 
he or she is not a member. 

The committees that exist 
today may seem irrelevant in 
relation to the adademic goals of 
the un iversity. This may arise 
from the fac t that much of the 
power o f running the UC system 
is delegated to the campus 
admin istrations. As noted before, 
finance is the ove rriding concern 
of the Regents. The Committee

Ensuring the integriry of the .

responsibility o f the Board of

have ucceeded and are 
succeeding depends on one's 

interpre ta~ion of what a

purposes are, and how it shOUld 
go about fulfi lling those 
purposes. The ability of the

to successfully undenake this

Spikers out in the 
'open' againstgoliaths 
Diyision I foes make playoffs impossible 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, Sports Ediror 

W HEN it comes to men's volleyball at the collegiate level, 
Southern California is king. The 
proximity to the beach has bred 
some of the world 's greatest 
spikers , setters, and blockers. Just 
take a look at the roster of the 
gold medal-winning 1984 
Olympic team. With a few minor 
exceptions, virtually every player 
is from a Southern California 
school like USC, UCLA, UC 
Santa Barbara, or Peppereline . 

Unfortunately for Division III 
UCSD, the Tritons must compete 
amongst these volleyball goliaths. 
Men's volleyball is in what is 
called an "open" dIvisIOn, 
meaning there is no 
dIfferentiation between Divisions 
I, II, and III. UCSD must regularly 
play bIg boys like USC or San 
Diego State . 

But the bottom Ii ne is brutally 
realistic: UCSD, baITIng a 
mimcle , has virtually no chance 
of ever making any type of POSt-
season play. 

A commiuee seleC[s teams that 
are invited to the Final Four, and 
a school from the DiVIsion II or 
III level has neve r been chosen 
to parnci pate . And unless a 
sepamte tournament for smaller 
schools comes about, it's going to 
Stay tha t way. 

"You'd probably have to win 
every game on your schedule to 
show the commiuee your 
strength ," said UCSD head coach 

Oscar "Digger" Graybill. "But with 
all the Division I schools on the 
schedule, it looks very unlikely 
that will ever happen." 

Since there are only a 
combined 59 schools at the 
Division I, II and III levels, a 
separate tourney for smaller 
schools is improbable. In fact, if 
CBS didn't televise the men's 
volleyball final , any type of POSt-
season championship might not 
even exist. 

"Men's volleyball is struggling 
and has not really ca, ht onjn 

((We 're a real 
young squad and 
because we are so 
young, we are going 
to play up and down. " 

-Digger Graybill 

we'll get close if not surpass the 
14 wins. 

Graybill is relying on the 
setting capability of Marco 
Gentzbourger, a six-foot 
freshman from Cannes, France, 
after switching from a six-two to 

. five-one offensive setup. 
'As Marco goes, the rest of the 

team goes," said Graybill. "If he 
sets good , then our hiuers have 
some good sets to hit off of." 

Unfortunately, the Tritons 
have problems just sizing up to 
their opponents. 

"We are a good four to five 
inches shorter than the big 
schools," said Graybill, "and 
since blocking is such a big part 
of men's volleyball, we do have 
problems matching upfront." 

John Lim has given the 
Tntons some strong play upfront, 
along with Mesa Junior College 
transfer. Jeff Lane, who at 28 
years old, has been, according to 
Graybill, christened the "daddy" 
of the team. 

UCSD meets Cal State San 
Bernardino Friday night at 
Triton Pavillion , and if the match 
is anything like their last 
meeting, the encounter could be 
a gut-wrencher. 

':We won in five games, but 
we didn't play well: said 
Graybill . "We've played really well 
at home this year, so we expect 
a good game out of our guys: 

The game starts at 7:30 
pm. ~ 

Jeff Lane, a 28-year old junior college transfer, has added strength to the 
Triton fnmtline, leading UCSD to it's current 11-11 record. 

Triton surfers are finding the groove 
By JACK BERESFORD 

MIKE Glevy, the captain of the UCSD Surf-team, leaned forward and 
dropped into one of the best 

waves of the day. The crowd 
cheered as he carved ofT the top 
and headed for the tube . But Just . 
as he was about to pull under 

the lip , another surfer paddled 
right in front of his board and 
the two met in a violent 
collision. The crowd went crazy. 

Mike JUSt laughed and grabbed 
another Budweiser. 

This was no ordinary surf 
comest, but the "Waterless 
Indoor Surfing Championships" 
held on Club Diego's new video 
surfing machine last Sunday 
Night. As both a promotional 
evem and a fund raiser for the 
UCSD Surf Club, surfers 
competed for a $100 prize under 
what could be called 
"comrolled"conditions. While the 
guys lined up to give the 
machine their best shot, young 
ladles danced to Wang Chung 
and watched the ac tion on huge 
wide-screen TV. 

But the scene was much 
different ea rl ier Sund ay morning 
as the same surfers com peted in 
the wind and pouring rams at 
the Huntington Beach Pier. The 
evem was a quad-meet surf 
contest be tween the best four 
collegiate teams in Southern 
California. 

Surfing "real"waves the UCSD 
team domi nated the competition 
fin ishing first, ahead of Golden 
West, San Diego State, and Usc. 
In the stormy conditions and 
relatively small one to three foot 
waves, Triton surfers fini hed in 
seven of the top twelve pOSitions. 
Once again , Allen Joh nson led 
the team , finishing third in the 
Men's division on a borrowed 

board . He broke a fi n out of his 
regular board in his first heat 
when he misjudged the 
Huntington shore break and ran ' 
up onto the sand. Johnson 
described the incident later: "I 
started the heat wi th a tri-fi n 
and ended up with a twin-fin." 

Also in the Men's final for 
UCSD we re Dennis Poroy, who 
finished fifth and Mike Glevy 
who came in sixth place. Bob 
Schiff won the Kneeboard Fi nal 
and Chris Zei tler took the 
Women's division. 

The team's wi n was impressive • 
not only in its show of talent but 
also in its new-found dedication. 
UCSD was the only school to 
field an entire squad in the 
stormy conditions. Mike Glevy 
reflected, "Having everybody 
there really payed off." 

This is a dramatic change 
from last year's team when th ree 
of the top six surfers fa iled to 
show for the State 
Championships. The only no-
show for this contest was coach 
Ed Machado who, quite 
understandably, was at home 
with the Assistant 'Coa h Zee 
Machado and their six-day old 
baby Jade. All three, however, 
hould be on the beach March 

14 and 15, when the team surfs 
its next contest in Newport 
Beach. ~

ASHER REELS IN A SUPER WEEKEND! 
Well, there are weekends and th~n there are WEEKE OS! Revelle sophomorej] fisher embarked on a beauty 

thIS past Thursday and ",hen all was over and done wllh, 11 was more than obVIOUS thatj] would have plenty of 
sweet dreammg motenal for the next couple of months 

fIsher, [or those of you who don't know hIm yet, IS the reSident cannon on the Men's Baseball team. That's 
cannon as 10 KA-WHOO HI That's the sound the ball makes when It comes flymg out of FIsher's powerful nght 
arm. 

FIsher IS also the newly crowned champIon of the UCSD Superstars AU-spons Compemion. All that was made 
offiC Ial unday evenIng as he su C(ss[uUy completed the grueling four. day. 10-event test of power, stam ma, sktll, 
and IOglSllcs HIS mark of6132 potnts edged out formerSupertarsChamplon Doug Roche, and put him only 69 
POIntS shy of the all-ume Superstars pomt record. 

FIsher's accomphshment was made mfmllely more dIfficult than all of the othercompelltors in that he also had 
to squeeze three varmy baseball games 1010 that same 'I-day time frame On Thursday and Friday, things were n't 
really Iookmg tOO good Whtle he dnd hIS teammates were geumg waxed allover theIr own ballfield.j] was also

FIsher was nowhere to be found unlll some last mtnute scrambling and rescheduling of cvcnt3 allowed h.m to 
get staned HO",Cller, onLC thl' moror 't .... ted runnmg, FIsher became a Huckleberry Fmn 10 ftfth gear HIS 308- fl. 
monster heave 10 the >cftball Ihrow got the cOrn;>et1l1ve JU Ices Oowmg and much of the rest was hIstory. 

In each succeedmg CVent. the pack at the tOP came back to htm and bySaturdayaftcrnoon,lJ was [eelinggood 
again. 0 good that he crashed a flrst-mnlOg grand slam ho lT1e run that powered the baseball team to a 18-0 
thumpmg over NCAA nval Cal tate-Stantslaus 

Come Sunday, Ilsher hnally was positioned [or h,s concentrated mo'e to the top of the POInt tables· the only 
problem being that our good [nenu Doug Roche was sllllleavmg hIm 10 the dust al every tum j] went 5-6 In the

SPUDS' SPORTSTERS 
BUD UGHT TEAM OF tHE WEEK 
tHE HERD AND tHE FORaKINS 

It was the ideal matchup . a basketball fan'S dream-come- true 
. , , lHE HERD AND lHE FORESKINS going against the 
RIMRIDERS_ Both teams loaded with talent and a buming desire to be 
number one. The scene was set the Triton Pavillion packed. and the 
long awaited contest was underway_ 

The RIMRIDERS came out extremely strong. seemingly c/omjnating 
every facet ot the game. taking an early ~int lead. Then HmID 
p,¥r-coach Matt Adams called a crudal time-out No one knows 
exacto/ what he said ciJring that one minute. but the H..., came 
out with tire in their ~s. 1hor Decker and Jon Kilty took control ot 
the boards. not gMng the RIMRIDERS at'rj second chances, From 
there, lou Matz and Brandon Nixon initiated a fast break that \NOuld 
make the Lakers envious. When the defense was finally able to slow 
the break, Tim Scott's deadly jump shot iced things up as 1M. HERD 
AND THE POIIUIONS vvere victorious, 57-51. 

ms year's AAA basketball is very competitive and I'm sure these tINO 
teams haven't seen the last of each other, 

Volume 14. Number 8 
February 26. 1987 

In the big leagues 
The Human League, 

performing tonight at 8 in the 
gym, deserve to be remem~ 
bered in the years to come as 
moder n ~day Cyrano de 
Bergeracs. Remember them 
for writing very personal love 
songs, not for their Euro~ 
disco beats or androgynous 
image. Imagine songs such as 
1981 's "Don't You Want 
Me" and " Mirror Man," or 
1983's "(Keep Feeling) 
Fascination" being performed 
at a "Live~Aid"-type concert 

'in the year 2000, when mnybe 
synthesizer sounds will still be 
in vogue; what will or won't 
make these songs endure are 
the messages. 

Crash, the group's fourth 
and latest album, has the most 
arresting and sophisticated 
varijition of love lyrics yet. 
Through a well thought out 
song sequence, the album tells 
a story of two people involved 
in a completely materialistic 
relationship who secretly see 
other lovers. In the song 
"Human," which went to 
number one on the charts last 
month, the lovers confess to 
each other about their affairs 
and separate, becoming 
despondent and lonely. Side 
two starts with " I Need Your 
Loving," which went to 
number five and tells of these 
people frequenting different 
nightclubs as a brief relief 
from the pain oflostlove. At a 
party, they meet again, fall 
back in love, and live happily 
ever after. 

A lot of credit has to be 
given to the group's latest 
producing and w"iting team, 
Jimmy Jam Games Harris III) 
and Terry Lewis, formerly 
members of The Time, along 
with Morris Day and Jesse 
Johnson. 

"We work very weird ," 
said the 27 year-old Harris 
from the duo's F1yte~Tyme 
recording studios in 

Minneapolis. "The Human 
League left here without a 
cassette. They just had to trust 
us." Earlier this year, such 
"trust ing" had led to six hits 
in the Billboard Top 100 at 
the same time: Janet Jackson's 
"What Have You Done For 
Me Lately" and "Nasty" 
(bot h from the multi~ 
platinum album Control), the 

/ 

by art~ur salazar 
Force M.D.'s "Tender Love," 
Patty Austin's "The Heat of 
Heat," the SOS Band's "The 
Finest," and "Sarurday Love" 
from the Cherellel Alexander 
O'Neal duet. The duo of 
Harris and Lewis received a 
Grammy for Producers of the 
Year in the category of Non~ 
Classical Music. 

In general, Lewis supplies 

the lyrics and Harris the runes. 
Although they produced all of 
Crash, they wrote only three 
of the songs: "Human," "I 
Need Your Loving," and 
"Love Is All That Matters" 
(which will probably be the 
band's next release), a ballad 
from which any excerpt 
repeats the constant love 
theme: 

Behind the scenes 
·at the Grammys 

The Grammy Awards is 
one of the "Big Three," and 
the biggie in . the music 
industr y. The event evokes 
images of glamour, prestige, 
and excitement. And it was, 
yet few know what goes on 
behind the scenes. 

After being on stage, a 
performer, presenter or 
winner is led through the 
various press areas. 
Depending on their "star 
status" they either are 
ba rraged by questions, 

. photographed, filmed and 
photographed agai n 'or 
unfortunate ly overlooked 
by the paparazzi . Due to lack 
of space, the media cannot 

by marla h ellman 
record every word or 
capture every nuance of such 
an action~packed event. 

The following are some 
h ighli g h ts th a t were 
bypassed by the larger press: 
e The Judds, the mother~ 
daughter team, were sruck in 
traffic and were unable to 
pick up their Grammy for 
the Best Country Perfor~ 
mance by a· Duo or Group 
with Vocal. Yet they 
considered the ev~nt a 
"thrill," and "music to be 
the common bond in their 
relationship. " 
e When asked what Johnny 
Carson was really like, Doc 
Severinsen answered "like 

any other mill ionaire from 
Nebraska ." Severinsen won 
the Grammy for Best Jazz 
Instrumental Performance, 
Big Band. 
. "That's Polka, P~O~L-K~ 
A," Eddie Blazonczyk 
implored when no questions 
were asked of the winners of 
the Best Polka Recording. 
. Steve Win wood, a double 
Grammy winner who had 
never been nominated 
before said, "it makes you 
feel like what you've been 
doing has not been in vain." 
. Barbra Streisand, winner 
of the Best Pop Vocal 

Please tum to page .. 

Love fOTgiving 
Love fOT good 
Love to keep us faithful 
After aLL is said and done 
. Love is all that mntters, 
Got this beautiful situation 
I've finaLLy found out 
What life's about 
Want to talk about it 
In my conversation 
Going to teLL the world 
Going to sing it 
From the highest mountaintop. 

"Terry and Jimmy have 
taken us closer to what we 
always wanted to be with the 
original Human League," said 
lead vocalist Philip Oakey. 
" When we started, we wanted 
to make Donna Summer 
records, but we never had the 
ability to do it." 

He continued, " We 
thought you could do it 
without a bass player or a 
drummer, but you can't. It's 
like trying to write a speech 
and leaVing out all the 'a "s and 
the ' the"s. It's a language, and 
if you don't conform to that 
language, you can't expect to 
communicate in the same 
way." 

Said Harris , "We like to 
address subjects maybe that 
have been addressed before 
but maybe in a different 
fashion. What you do as a 
producer is basically bring out 
the best of the artist. You try 
to bring out the talent." 

Tonight's opening act for 
the Human League, which is 
composed of Joanne 
Catherall , Philip Oakey, 
Susan Sulley, Ian Burden, 
Adrian Wright, and Jim 
Russell , is APB. Tickets may 
be purchased at the campus 
box office for $14.50 with a 
student ID and $16.50 
without, and also thro ugh 
Ticketmaster by phon ing 
232-0800.

This artist's for you 
by david forman 

For any avid musIc listener 
of college age or better, 
perhaps your fi rst memory of 
Leon Redbone came from hiS 
1976 appearance on Saturday 
Night Live. Redbone, for the 
most part unknown at the 
time, sat cross-legged on stage, 
his body mamly silhouetted 
against the light . Whtle 
sporting dark glasses, a wide-
brimmed ha t, a thick 
mustache and a goatee, he 

c~ooned through the old 
standard "Shme on Harvest 
Moon. .. By the time he 
returned later in the show to 
sing his version of Irving 
Berlin's "My Walkmg Stick," 
he had sealed his fate as a 
presence in the music 
business. Almost overnight, 
record sales from hiS first 
album "On the Track It 
Jumped from 15,000 to 
190,000 copies sold. In the 
1980s he has regained much 
of this popularity with hiS 
frequent appearances in 
Budweiser commercials. 

Redbone, whose persona-
hty is shaped by a self-
implemented mysterious 
personal life, lets hiS musIc 
descnbe hiS personality. Once 
labelled as a singer/ guitarist 
anachronism, Redbone brings 
the listener back to a more 
simple, bucolic time, when 
music could be termed as 
"sentimental." He comments, 
"All it IS IS early American 
recording, the popular music 
of the day, depending on what 
neck of the woods you were in 
at the time." Redbone's music 
draws from many necks of the 
woods, from soft country 
blues to jazz, with many 
American standards tossed in. 
"The whole point of the 
musIc is that It is sentimental 
musIc ." 

Redbone; who has been 
vanously described as having 
a "mellifluous baritone" or a 
"grizzly bass vOice," has 
confused Critics since the mid-
seventies. Unsure whether to 
label him as a serious 

mUSician. an anachromsm or a 
novelty , many have Simply 
overlooked his talents. He 
admits that hiS guitar playing 
IS " haphazard," seeing it 
mamly as an accompamment 
to hiS vocals. Redbone 
explainS: "I just learned a 
couple of chords and took It 
from there . I don't know 
theory; all I know is what I 
hear. I do It very Simply." 

In his own way, however, 
Redbone is unique. Though 
he has many mfluences, such 
as Blind Blake and Lonnie 
Johnson, he never tries to 
imitate the masters. 
"ObViously it loses 
somethmg, because no 
matter how well [the people 
who imitate artists] learn 
how to do it they still won 't 
be able to do it right. " 
Basically, Redbone's 
technique IS a "three-finger 
style" of fmgerplcking, 
letting his thumb cover the 
other three strings. He 
picked up the techmque 
from playing the ukelele. 

Redbone's discography has 
not been very extensive, but it 
has been cntically acclaimed. 
His 1976 debut "On the 
Track," an album of pre-
World War II tunes, was 
followed by "Double Time" 
and "Champagne Charhe." In 
1981, an unauthorized live LP 
called "Mystery Man" 
surfaced, followed by another 
unauthorized live double 
album set titled "Leon 
Redbone Live." The latter 
was the subject of a laWSUit 
between Redbone and his 
producer. 

After a long silence, 
Redbone released a new 
album 10 1986 entitled "Red 
to Blue." The album's title is 
taken from a line spoken by 
Jelly Roll Morton referring to 
changing the feel of a rhythm 
from Spanish to blues by 
changmg Its syncopation . 
"Most of what I do is based on 
just that prinCiple," Redbone 
admmed. The new album IS

getting your start in theater." 

graduate, normal, full,stage 
level, (and) will be one show a 
night, at 8 o'clock," said 
Hunter. 

Cabaret. The word 
conjures up visions of 
entertainment, and for years, 
cabaret has meant free,form 
entertainment, and bawdy 
stagework. Resembling the 
phenomenally successful Yale 
Cabaret, this unique stage 
entertainment form has come 
to UCSD, and is providing a 
vast array of possibilities for 
theater students. 

UCSD's student cabaret 
began evolving early in 1984, 
when several students under 
the guidance of Michael 
Kanter, staged a cabaret,like 
comedy at the Triton Pub. It 
was, by all accounts, a strictly 
slapdash effort, with more in' 
house references to the drama 
department than anything 
else. Yet, it was well attended 
- well enough, at least, to 
prompt the department to 
consider staging a student 
cabaret on a regular basis. 

Since the "in,joke" event, 
students have been taking 
center stage four times each 
weekend (at 8 pm and 10 pm 
Fridays and 9 pm and 11 pm 
Saturdays), to present a 
different offering each time to 
small capacity crowds at 
Warren 409S. "The guiding 
priciple behind cabaret (is)

improvisation, the unex,

ment," said cabaret managing 
director, Vicki Hunter. 

Artistic Director Beth 
Schachter adds, "The other 
thing that's most important 
about it in some ways, 
although it's not an artistic 
choice - in many ways it's 
almost a political choice - is 
that it's free, totally, totally 
free." 

One of the reasons cabaret 
is free is because of a lack of 
overhead. Each production is 
given a set budget of $40, and 
individual directors must 
make of that budget what they 
will. "I think that (the budgets 
and the lack of an admission 
cost) is what makes possible 
the fact that it can be 

improvisational, and new 
material," Schachter 
explained . "The budget really 
helps us do our work, and do 
it well," echoed student 
director John Godfrey. "If 
you erew up, that's okay," 
Godfrey said, speaking of the 
creative atmosphere created 
by the student actors ,

and have had small, but eager,

The mark of Tim Ash may not be quite as devastating as the mark of 
Zorro, but for the Triton Fencing team and, in particular, the sabre team, 
this t'INO year blade veteran has left an indelible impression. 

In January at Cal Berkeley, Tim led the team to an All Cal victory sweep, 
finishing second individually. Currently he sits in the #2 spot in the 
conference with a 6-1 win-loss conference record and an 18-3 overall 
record This is especially impressive when one considers that UCSD Fencing 
competes in the NCAA open division against teams from Divisions I and II. 

Considered a contender for selection to the Nationals, Tim not only has 
achieved excellence in his event but has also helped instill a rle\N found 
confidence in the team as a \Nhole. 

'With his speed, creativity and fast reflexes, Tim has provided the 
impetus to bring up the level of his teammates, pushing them to maximize 
their speed," said coach Lynne Antonelli. "He has been an enthusiastic 
supporter of all members of the team, adding the confidence and pizzazz 
characteristic of a sabre man." 

For his outstanding performance at the All-Cal Tournament and in 
recognition of his leadership abilities in sending UCSD Fencing into an 
entirely rtf!!VI/ dimension of performance, UCSD Athletics is proud to make 
Tim Ash a redpient of the Bud Ught Athlete-of-the-Month award for the 
month of January.
