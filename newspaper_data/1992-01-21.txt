OIanceUor Richard Atkinson. Vice 
OIanceUor for Undergraduate Af-
fairsJoseph Watson, Assistant Vice 
0IanceU0r for Student Programs 
and Facilities Tom Tucker and Uni-
versity Center Director Jim 
Carruthers may not interfere with 
the operation of the General Store. 

In addition, it also states thai the 
General Store Co-op is required to 
submit its financial books for an 
audit and oversight purpo!iC:S 10 the 
UCSD InIemal Audit offICe. 

Both sides hail the ruling as a 
victory. 

"The restraining order is every-
thing we wantcd." said Steve Dubb 
ofGl'OWldwork Books. 'This is his-
toric action - this is the first time 
students have gotten a restraining 
order against the administration." 

WIlSOn indiClled that he felt the 
court action was a victory for the 
administration because it affinns 
the. university's demand to obtain 
the accounting infonnation. 

"The court did not rule on the 
General Store being a student orga-

nization," Watson said. "I'm glad 
[the students] feel positively about 
[the court ruling] because I feel very 
positively." 

But Denise Fenton, the Gradu-
ate Student Association (GSA) 
president, warned that the court rul-
ing does not mean this issue is re-
solved. "We're too comfortable. 
Both sides think they've won. Un-
less students engage the administra-
tion, this could all happen again. We 
have a temporary resolution - we 
need a pennancnt one," she said. 

Although the co-op's financial 
documents were submitted to the 
InIemal Audit office after the court 
order was approved, Molly McKay, 
chair of the University Center Board 
(UCB), contends thai the co-ops 
had already agreed 10 tum over the 
financial information before the 
court order was sought. 

Jeff Corbett, manager of the 
General Store co-<>p, confirms this 
claim. "We had made a verbal agree-
ment to tum in the books at noon 
Wednesday. That morning, as we 
were preparing the books, Tucker 
came back and kicked us out of the 
store," he said. 

A~ngtoCorbett,~ause 
they did not have access to the com-
puters which contained the finan-
cial documents, the co-op mem-
bers' plan 'to relinquish the records 
was delayed. As a result, the records 
were not turned over until after the 
court order was approved. "We were

GSA Recommends Boycott 
Of Price Center Businesses 
., PhIlp Michaels 
Staff Writer 

The UCSDGraduate Student As-
sociation «(iSA) called for a boycott 
of businesses in the Price Center to 
protest the actions of the adminis-
tration toward the C<K>ps. 

The resolution, passed unani-
mously at a special meeting on Fri-
day. recommends that the boycott 
continue "until such time as clear 
progress is being made between the 
co-ops and the administration." 

Price Center businesses were 
singled out for boycott because GSA 
members felt that such amove would 
put the most pressure on the admin-

istration. GSA members said they 
believe that ifbusiness is bad for the 
Price Center contract vendors, then 
the administration will be forced to 
address the co-op situation. 

"Thus far. students haven ' t been 
able to bring the university admin-
istration to the table," said GSA 
President Denise Fenton, 

"[The boycott) will enlist [Price 
Center contract vendors'] aid in 
helping to bring the administration 
to negotiate," she added. 

The boycott, however, does not 
include all of the facilities in the 
Price Center. The GSA emphasized

Regents Approve Govemor's Proposed Fee Increase 
UC FUNDING • Students at UC Davis follow UCSD's lead and take 

over Freeborn Hall, where the regents' meeting was held 
A look at the sources of funding for 
the UC's general budget (for the year 
which ended June 30,1990): 

By JaIon SneI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The University of California Board of 
Regents approved a 22 percent UC student 
fee increase Friday in Davis, causing hun-
dreds of angry students to storm the meeting 
hall in protest. 

The increase, approved as part of the 
budget unveiled last week by Governor Pete 
Wilson, will raise the average cost for under-
graduate in-state UC students by $550 to 
$3,036 per year. 

"[Students] realize that the state is in dire 
circumstances ... [but] we must oppose a fee 
increase of this magnitude," University of 
California Student Association (UCSA) 
President Marisela Marquez told the board 
before the vote. 

But the regents were nearly unanimous in 
their approval of the budget, with only Ex-
Officio Regent and Lieutenant Governor 
Leo McCarthy casting a negative vote. 

Among those regents voting for the plan 
was Student Regent Diana Darnell, a gradu-
lie student at UCSF. 

"I'm totally outraged that our student 
regent voted in favor of the increase," 
said UCSA Vice President and former 
UCSD A.S. PresidentJohn Edson, who 
was in Davis for the meeting. "It looked 
vel)' bad to have Diana Darnell vote for 
the increase." 

After approving the budget, most of 
the regents, including Wilson, left UC 
Davis' Freeborn Hall, where the meet-
ing was taking place. Outside, on Free-

born plaza, several hundred students had 
gathered at an ASUCD rally against the fee 
increase. 

"We had a rally last year, and only 50 
students showed up, so we didn't expect 
anyone to corne," said Darby Monisroe, the 
ASUCD's assistant director of state lobby-
ing. "But a couple of students had a ponable 
megaphone, and students came up one by 
one to talk about the fee increase." 

Among those students who spoke at the 
rally were the president and the vice presi-
dent of ASUCD. Edson says that before they 
spoke, he told them about the student pro-
tests that followed the administrative break-
in into the General Store Co-op at UCSD 
Wednesday. 

"[TheASUCDofficials] got up and spoke 
to the rest of the crowd, and said students 
took over R building at UCSD," Edson said. 
"Then some students got up and said, 'Let's 
take Freeborn HaIL' .. 

''1l1e students couldn't take anymore," 
Monisroe said. "So from 300 to 500 of us 
stonned [the building]." 

According to Edson, the few regents who 
were inside relocated their luncheon with 
the student regent candidates to elsewhere 
on campus to avoid clashing with the student 
protestors. 

Five UC Davis students were arrested by 
police on Friday on charges including as-
saulting a police officer, rioting, and the 
attempted rescue of a student who had al-
ready been arrested, according to UC Davis

Student support for co-ops lays the 
apathy myth to rest - for now 

By~".'­
SenIor Staff Writer 

The outpourina of student support for the 
co-ops last week was truly remarbble. 
During those few tumultuous days,1he myth 
of student apathy was shattmd. It remairul to 
be seen whether this is merely the exception 
that proves the rule. 

What is unequivocal is that the ordeal 
sparked a tremendous sense of purpose in 
both members of the co-ops and general 
slUdent body. As for the faculty, they have 
supported us in the past. and their continued 
involvement is vital. 

On Wednesday morning, hundreds of 
students w~ energized in an act of sponta-
neous combustion, mobilizing ouu.ide the 
General Store to take the co-op back from 
the administrators and police who deter-
mined that they w~ above the law. 

Wilb no prior warning, bombs were 
dropped. It was war. Students fought back 
with extraordinary dedication. The sponaano-
ity was incredible. Ideas exploded from 
every comer. There was enonnous solidarity. 
People who dido't know each od1er instandy 
began working together to think up chants 
minutes before we went on !he televisian 
news live at 11 or to make fliers for a rally. 

We can win this war. But before we plan 
our specific stnUegy, we must step back and 
look at what is essentially happening. The 
fundamental issue here is the noIion of 
power. On the surface, this question is about 
the authority to make and enforce decisions. 
But the underlying questian is Ihat of the 
power to define the parameters of the debate 
and to label the players. The entity that bas 
this power enters the debate wilb an inherent 
advantage. 

On a g10bal scale, the U.S. power elite 
have been comparatively successful in 
fostering public complacency. The public 
becomes what Noam Olomsky calls the 
"bewildered herd" in need of direction from 
its leaders. The various institutional forces 
have shaped and defined the framewoat of 
public discourse in this counay, and it would 
take a veritable revolution to effect 1arge-
scale social change. Personally, I can't say 
I'm much of a revoluUonaJ)' in thIl respect. 

But hen: in the )ocaliud context of the 
campus, social change can occur. It is a

Edson, whowas JRSCI1t at UC Davis 
when the event occurred. 

"A march was dropped with the 
knowledge of the srudenl takeover

he said 

Al UCSD, the anti-administra· 
tion sentimenr was shared by aboul 
SOO other activists who attended a 
rally Thursday, which was covered 
by aevc:rallocal news Slalions. 

"Ai first rbe administration is 
like a biB wall. But, if you poke at it,

is COIIbOl of student fee funded fa-

at the rally said they feel that be-
cause rbe funding for the co-ops 
comes from their own pockets, the 
organizalions should be conrrolled 
by the SlUdents. 

~,many srudents feel 
Ihaa because rhcy pay for the admin· 
isrrarors' salary, the adminisrrarors 
should work to serve the SlUdents, 
not conrrollhem. 

Watson had a different view· 
point on the situalion. ''1bere can· 
not be a circumstance where we 
accept liabiliry and have no over· 
sighl of the c(H)()S. This is the basic 
issue," he said. 

WIllsOn also suggested that if the 
co-ops really want freedom from 
the adminisrralioo, they can enler 
inlO a conU'8Cl vendor stalus. 

Inthis silUalion, the co-ops would 
have to supply their own insurance

would be required 10 pay rem at

Watson added rhar he was nol

"I don't feel ashamed aboul any· 
rhing we've done. Maybe I should, 
but I don'L I feel our actions are

Perhaps an even more basic is· 
sue is to blame for the co-op crisis. 
80rh sides expressed a need for 
communication and neg()(iation. 

"We need 10 have this conversa·

the administration isn't willing to

''1be adminisrration won't ne-

A meeting between the co-ops

"1be sun pulses ever so 
slightly. No one underscands 
why ... Noone's looked .. these 
particular frequencies that 
we' re looking at for this fluc-
tuation. So we're the first to 
really look for these low oscil-

Michael Baine, a Warren Col-
lege senior and CWTCnI pay-
load manager forthe Get Away 
Special Experiment San Di-

• Established by NASA. the Get Away Special (GAS.) allows 
experimenters easy access to space.The experiments are 
self-contained in containers called GAS Cans. 

1be experiment is pan of 
the Get Away Special (GAS.), 
a program developed by 
NASA and the Goddard Space 
AightCcntertoallowresearch 
scientists low<OSt access to 
space. It is extremely rare for 
G.A.S. projects to involve col-
lege students. While some ex-
periments have been produced 
at Utah Swe University, stu-
dent involvement is!heexcep-
tion more than !he rule. 

"Most of them (GAS. ex-
periments) are done by Japa-
nese and Gennan space agen-
cies," Baine said. 

The inclusion of major ex-
periments on shunte flights 
pays forthe mission. whileonly 
requiring approximately 70 
percenI o( the cargo bay. 1be 
remaining space is occupied 
by !he G.A.S. experiments, 
which are approved by NASA 
on !he basis of relevance and 
scientifIC value. 

Experiments are contained 
in cannisters called G.A.S. 
cans, ranging in size from 2.S 
cubic feet to S cubic feeL 1be 

The cans are mounted on the side of a shuttle's cargo bay.

Experiments 
roost be ruggedly 
designed to 
survive the 
extreme 
cold of 
space and 
random 
vibration. 

NASA provides an 
electrical interface 
but does not 
supply power. 

Size Ra ... e: 
2.5 cubic feet to 5 cubic feet 

cans are generally aaached to '--__ _ 
the sides of the cargo bay. 

"TheG.AS. program is sort 
of [public relaaions) for NASA. 1bey 
lose money on it," Baine said. "It's about 
$5,000 to launch a two-and-a-half foot 
can weighing less than 100 pounds, and 
that'sbasicalJy justapft [from NASA)." 

The G.A.S. Experiment San Diego 
began in 1986 when Hugh Hudson from 
the Center of Astrophysics and Space 
Science at UCSD proposed an experi-
rocntto measure pulses in the sun's iUu-
mination. 

"Nomen Cane [a former AMES stu-
dent] had discussed getting involved in 
G.A.S.," said Massoud Simnad, faculty 
advisor to the projectand a UCSD AMES 
adjuncJ professor. "We discussed sev-
eraltopics. Then, Dr. Hudson brought up 
this one." 

The project was initially supported by

Anteaters Devour Tritons 
• Head Coach Rod 
WIlde says UCSD men's 
volleyball is enduring a 
tough early season. 
., ............ 

GIIMfM~ 
The UCSD men'. volleyball 

team dropped ill IhinI CXI"IeCUIiw 
match Friday .... 10 10th rwUd 
UC Irvine, 1S-13, IS-Io, IS-~, in 
Irvine. 

The Trit0n5 led the fine pme 
13-12, beftR sua:umbin& 10 the 
Anteaters . 

As UCSD Head Coach Rod 
Wilde said. "We hadacoupleofreal 
close hilS that missed by inches." 

The Trilons continued to banle 
in the second game. according to 
Coach Wilde. but again they came 
up short. 

During the third game. the Ant-
eaters let their rhythm flow into 
their hilling. In the first game, 
Irvine's hining, a .243 average as a 
team. was well below their normal. 

Regaining theirconfldence in the 
third match. their average wenl back 
up 10 .462. 

Wilde had mentioned previously 
thai the leam needed to spread the 
offense around. 

Friday, they succeeded in divid-
ing up the offense with standout 
perfonnances by junior Nate Brown 
and sophomore Matt Brigham. 

Brown's hilling average for the 
night was .696. He had 16 kills out 
of 23 attempts while commining 
only one error. 

Brigham hit on five of seven 
hining anempts also with only one 

0unIM FIll PIIIID 
Despite Nate Brown's 16 kills, UCSD fell to UC Irvine Friday night. 
enor, giving him a .571 average for 
the nighl. 

Brown led the taun in digs with 
nine and Brigham contributed throe 
blocks. 

Coach Wilde felt that one of the 
factors comibuting to the loss was 
that UCSD did not block as weJl as 
in the third game. 

Also imponant was UC Irvine's 
increasing confidence in iI's hining 
as the game progressed. 

The TrilOll'l wiD play USC, which 
is ranked fifth nationally, on Tues-
day. 

Coach Wilde anticipales anodIer 
tough march from the Trojans, but 
he feels these IOOgh matches will 
help in the long run. 

Facing these tough teams early 
in the season will hopefuJly help 
improve the Tritons' confidence 
down the road. 

~We're taking some lumps these 
first games. but they will help 
toughen us up for Jarer games." 
Wilde said.

BcIa1as, Loopy 
And McIk Rypien 
J UST 1\ FEW NOTES: • Forccastina Ihe winner of next wedcend's Super Bore 
between BufJalo and Washingtoo 
is a dangerous task. Elther way 
you go, you're stepping out on a 
limb with about as much strength 
asJeny Brown's plalfonn. 

On the one hand, you have the 
Redskim - one of Ihe most non-
descripc teams in Super Bowl 
history. As a measure of how 
anonymous they are, consider that 
in this day and age of superstarS, 
their quanerback is Mark Rypicn, 
a fonner sixlh-roWld draft choice 
from Washington Slate, a 
quanerback factory which has 
also produced noced gunslinger ... 
Timm ROMnbach? On the other 
hand. the Bills' QB-Jim KeUy 
- hails from Miami (Fla.), which 
has produced Vinny Testaverde, 
Bernie Kosar and Steve Walsh. 

Okay, so maybe thai's not such 
a good comparison. 

Try something else. Can you 
name lhe Redskim' starting 
safeties? Do the names Brad 
Edwards and Danny Copeland 
ring a bell? No? How about 
Sidney Johnson? SliII nothing? 
You're nol alone. Reportedly, 
they came out of the FBI's 
Witness Procection Program. 

S llU". W IISHINGTON does have two major faclors on its side. 
Firsl, no one in footbalJ pn:parcs a 
tearn better than Gibbs and his 
coaching staff. If there is a way 10 
stop the no-huddle (trusl me, if 
Denver can limillhe Bills' offense 
to three points, il can be done), the 
Redskins will find a way. And 
second. the AFC is the Demo-
cralic Party of pro sports - the 
mark of incompetence in Ihe '80s. 

But these are Ihe '90s, and Ihe 
Bills do have a good lcam-
perhaps the best squad the AFC 
has sent to the Super Bowl in the 
last 10 years. The offense is 
loaded, although somewhat 
overrated. Don Beebe is about as 
scary as one, James Lofton's show 
was canceled a year ago, and for 
all his accomplishments, Jim 
Kelly hasn't done a damn thing in 
the NFL worth remembering. And 
he played like a dog againsl 
Denver. 

The defense is strong and 
phenomenally fast. BUI it's also 
inconsistent Funhennore, the 
Bills' weakness is in the defensive 
backfield. which could allow 
Rypicn and the Posse 10 go 
bananas - especially with deep 
outs and fly patterns, R ypien 
specialties. 

T HE PICK here is for the Redskins, which have the 
better coaching staff and are the 
more solid overall of the two 
leams. Bul if for no oilier reason, 
bet on Washington because it's 
from the NFC.

Winning Is a Hard Habit to Break for 8ask-.11 
• The Tritons run their 
win streak to eight as 
they glide to easy wim at 
Bethany and uesc. 
By KIll .......... 
Sporu Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team has fallen intoa routinc-a rut 
if you will. 

II seems the TrilOM have devel-
oped what their opponents would 
call a nasty habit 

They can't seem to stop win-
ning. 

Oh, il started OUI small, a Oivi-
sion ill win here, an NAJA win 
there. 

BUI before anyone realized whal 
was happening the Tritons were 
winning lournaments, beating Divi-
sion 0 squads. and ranling off six 
victories in a row. 

The Tritons weren 'I in any mood 
10 change this weekend either as 
Bethany Collegc and UCSanta Cruz 
became merely the latest in a long 
line to fall victim 10 UCSD (134) 
and its eigbt-&PUDC wining sareak. 

The Tritons IrOuncCd Bethany 
81-62 on Friday nl&ht before taking 
can: of Ihe Bmana SlUSS in similar 
fashion, 7543, on Saturday. 

II's not JUS( the fact dI8l UCSO is 
winning that seems to be roubne, 
butlhe way the Trilons are doing il 
as well. 

Friday nigbt against Bethany, 
UCSO was COI1tenllO win the way it 

has aU scaon. 
The biger Tritons rcpeMedly 

pushed the ball inside and relied on 
their biB men, nmlely Chris Moore 
and Andy Swindall, who finished 
with 19 points and 13 points respec-
tively, 10 get the job done. 

Rick Batt was also a big threat 
inside as he added 10 points to 
UCSD's cause in addition to his 
team-high eight rebounds . 

As Bethany began to take note of 
the Tritons' game plan and started 
to coUapsc inside, UCSO whipped 
lhe ball back outside to shooting 
guants Darvin Jackson and John 
Spence. 

The Tritons were a little less 
effcc:tive from long range, however, 
as Ihe two guards l1WUl8ed to com-
bine for only 10 in the game. 

Still, UCSD led by a cornfon-
able 44-31 margin at halftime be-
fore going on to lake the win behind 
a 40 percenl shooting night from the 
floor. 

A key to the Tritons' impressive 
win was their strong defensive per-
formance. 

While UCSD did allow Bethany 
big men Bryan Walker and Joseph 
Woods to knocldn 16 and l.5plinlS 
respectively, UCSD Head Coach 
Tom Marshall asserted that "de-
fense was a very important part of 
our win." 

The Tritons' defense has been 
extremely effective this year, hold-
ingopponents 10 Wldcr 70 points per 
game on average.

UCSD started out the game in a 
man-to-man defense, bul ran inlo 
problems with the Behrend offense.

offenses, setting two or three picks

'Loose Cannon' Carruthers 
Can anyone control our 

university center director? 
BY DEBRA BRONSTEIN , STAFF WRITER 

D ebare OVer the SIaluS of the co-ops has brought University Center 
Dim:tor Jim Canuthen under fue 
by everyone on campus. The 0n-
going fight for control over 
student issues demands • claritica-
tion of !he relatimWp beIween 
Carruthers and the University 
Center Board (UCB). 

Carru!hers' job description slates 
that the director must act "in 
conjunction with the University 
CenIer Board." But, according to 
Carruthers. "The 80ud does not 
make policy and procedures. All 
they can do is advise me. as they 
have no responsibility. If I do 001 
agree with their advice. I do not 
have to take it." 

According to Article DI, Section 
seven of !he UCB charter. "The 
University Center Director shall 
report to !he University Center 
Board at each meeting and shall 
work closely with the University 
Center Board 0Iair. The Univer-
sity Center Director shaU serve as 
chief st8ff advisor to the Univer-
sity Center Board,and implement 
policies consistent with policies of 

the University Center Board." 
The UCB chaner is clear in 

regards to how the board and the 
university center director should 
act tow8RI the co-ops. In article 
five. section six. clause one. the 
chaner defines a co-op as "a 
student-run organization with 
open membership and democratic 
structure that provides products, 
services or educational opportuni-
ties to !he University community 
in a nonprofit manner." 

The charter continues ~ Clause 
five. "The University Center 
Director, with the approvaJ and 
panicipation of the UCB. shall 
enter into agreements with srudenl 
co-ops and enterprises using 
University Cenler Facilities." 

The current revised UCB charter 
of Aug. 5, 1991 , states that "the 

.pwpose of the University Center 
Board ... shall be to establish 
policies which will assure that the 
University Center wiU be a 
unifying force between students, 
faculty and staff, a campus cenler 
for social, cultural and intellectual 
activities and services. and a place 
to provide further opponunities to 

broaden interpersonal relation-
ships and self-enbancement within 
a large university." 

The UCB consists of several 
voting members. including the 
chair. the Graduate Student 

. Association (GSA) president, the 
Associated Student Council (A.S.) 
president, one representative from 
each college council, the C(K)PS 
and Enterprises designee and the 
Student Affinnative Action 
Comminee chair. 

Its non-voting members include 
the director of the University 
Center, a representative from the 
A.S .• a representative from the 
Alumni Association, and a 
representative from the University 
Bookstore. 

Yet in regards to the C<>-Qp issue. 
Vice ChanceUer of Undergraduate 
Affairs Tommy Tucker says, 
"Carruthers is the representative. 
This is not a student issue." 

"I think that the co-ops are 
valuable serv ices not offered 
anywhere else," Carruthers says. 
"They represent choice and jobs. 
Nobody is questioning the concept

COMMENTARY BY 
BRETT RH YNE, 
SPECTACLE EDITOR 

Everybody wants to change the world. 
There are three ways of doing this. One 
i~ through revolution - scrapping what we 
have now and replacing it with something 
completely new and different. Anocher is by 
wooong within the current system to 
promote gradual change. 

The third is by creating an alternative 
system, and showing that it works better 
than the one we have now. 

This is what the c<HlpS are doing. Our 
society - and cenainly our university - is 
part of a capitalist system. Its highest goal is 
to make money, no matter who gets hurt 
doing it. The co-ops represent an a1temative 
- a different kind of world where the 
highest goal is to live a fulfilling life, where 
the ultimate consideration is given to 
others. 
A brief comparisoa 

• The university is run according to a 
hierarchy - Joe Watson tells Tom Tucker 
what to do, Tucker tells Jim Carruthers 
what to do, Carruthers tries to tell the 
students what to do. Everyone has a bas . 

A hierarchical system does two things. 
One, it shuts people out of decision-
making: how can you make a decision 
when everybody is always telling you what 
to do? Two, it inhibits people from taking 
responsibility: why be responsible when 
there's always a higher up to take the 
blame? As we all know, this can be very 
fiustraring. 

In a hierarchical system one is no longer 
self-determinate: you can no longer make 
decisions about your own well-being, you 
must rely on someone to do it for you. 
Here. students must rely on administrators 
to "take care" of them. Oearly, this goes 
against all democratic principles. 

The capitalist system is based on profit-
making. This can cause problems when it 
comes to running a university, where the 
primary function ought to be educating 
people. 

• In comparison. the co-ops are run non-
hierarchically. There is no "chain of 
command." All members of a co-op can be 
involved in all aspects of decision-making. 
What's more. decisions are made by 
consensus - all members must be satisfied 
before the final decision is made. It may 
mean four-hour meetings, but it is truly 
democracy. 

Without a hierarchy, all people have 
acces to infonnation and decision-making 
- and all people have a lot more responsi-
bility. You might say, "Who needs it?" and 
you might be right. But in the co-ops, 
people take responsibility for themselves. 
and as a result are self-determinate. They 
don't need someone to "take care" of them. 

And. as opposed to the capitalist notion 
oftuming a buck, the c()-()ps actually 
believe in the idea of educating people. 
They take as their reason for existence 
showing people how a bene!' life can be 

lived 
andabetler 
world can be 
made. Co-op volun-
teers Ieam a lot of cultural 
things that go beyond how to 
take orders so those Wendy' fries are 
golden-brown. 
Motives 

But why? Why would the administrators 
of this university commit such an act of 
violence against their own charges? Why 
would they want to shut down the C<H>pS7 
Here are three reasons: 

• Economic - The Price Center does 
not need the competition. Everyone knows 
the economy is in lousy shape, and the 
Price Center has been hurting a lot lately. 
Even the Guardia" tells us that sales in the 
Sunshine Store are way down, while the 
Food Co-op thrives. This quarter, Ground-
work Books carried texts for over 120 
classes - that's profits from 120 fewer 
sales going to the UC Bookstore. 

Why should the administration care so 
much about the businesses in the Price 
Center? One reason is because they make 
money from them. Another is because 
Watson, et a!. have inve ted too much 
money and effon in the Price Center not to 
have it ucceed. They neither want to lose 
face nor their shirts. 

• Political - The administrators of this 
campus want to control everything that 
goes on here. They want to make all the 
decisions. II's fine for students to be on 
"advisory boards," but the real power -
the power to allocate money - must come 
from the administrators. If the administra-
tors don' t have money to allocate, they 
don't have jobs. 

This is what the conflict over the UCB is 
all about. The UCB has a budget to allocate 
that comes from student-paid funds. Hence. 
students should have control over those 
funds. But Tucker and the boys insist that 
they should have control over those funds. 
If they don't, they have nothing to do. 

• Cultural - There are two conflicting 
cultures here at UCSD: a capitalist culture 
as exemplified by the administration and an 
alternative student culture as exemplified 
by the co-ops. We all can't help but be 
shaped by the culture in which we live. In 
other words. the administrators adopt this 
inherently anti-student stance because they 
don't know any belter. Society on the whole 
is a capitalist one; for Carruthers, he may 
know nothing else. 

But there's no reason why we can't 
choose to change our culture, or adopt 
another one. The co-ops offer a more 
humanistic alternative. Many students have 
already chosen to adopt the ways of that 
culture. Why not the administrators?

the co-ops and the university adminislraIion

existence. 

Taken in isolation, any event can be 
interpreted in a myriad of ways. When 
understood as only ~ IaIest incident in a 
long chain of incidents, however, more 
insight can be drawn from current actions. 
If the administration acts aggressively, or 

. the co-ops are mistrustful. their motives 
become clearer with historical perspective. 

In 1976. the Student Center opens. In 
1980. a UCSD policeman is caught 
burglarizing Groundwork Boob using a

Director Tommy Tucker tells Groundwork 
to stop selling textbooks or he will shut 
them down. Groundwork continues to 
supply textbooks, and are not closed. 

1n June of 1987, the co-ops' leases 
expire. University Center Director Jim 
Carruthers fails to renew them, against the 
instructions of the University Center Board 
(UCB). In September of that year he 
decides not to renew the leases at all, 
claiming that "Co-ops don' t need leases, 
they're owned by the University."TIle 
UCB directS him to offer "space agree-
ments." which he does. 

In May of 1988, the Che Cafe is closed 
by Carruthers, due to a lack of maintenance 
that is required by the University. In fact, 
the maintenance is not supposed to be 
completed by Ole workers at all, but by 
University Center workers. who are the 
responsibility of Carruthers himself. The 
required work is eventually done by CM 
members, who then reopen the collective.

replacing the previous 2 page document. 

On June 30, 1989, the co-ops' "space 
agreements" expire. The main obstruction 
to a new lease concerns pUlling university 
locks on all the co-op doors. This would 
have allowed anyone with the correct 
master key access to the co-ops and would 
have required the co-ops to present a list of 
their prospective key-holders to the 
administration for approval. The co-ops see 
this new development as a severe curtail-
ment of their autonomy and refuse. 

1990: Despite being leaseless since June, 
the co-ops continue to pay rent, continuing 
their normal oper.:llions under the authority 
of the previous leases. Carruthers repeat-
edly attempts to force the co-ops into 
signing the administration-proposed lease 
with the key clause. saying that if they did 
not sign. they will be replaced. 

The administration threatens to evict the 
co-ops three times. with deadlines of March 
9, June 19 and June 30. They never do so. 

The co-ops maintain that they will not 
sign a new lease until the clause pertaining 
to university keys is stricken. On February 
3, representatives of the UCB and the co-

ops agree upon a new lease exclud-

ing the key clause. The UCB approves the 
lease at their Feb. 12 meeting, and man-
dates Carruthers to formally present it. 

Carruthers fails to do so, instead sending 
the co-ops a version that reinserts the 
university key requirement. Once again he 
threatens eviction. 

The UCB passes a resolution on Feb. 26 
stating that they recognize only their key-
free lease as the proper one. that co-op 
eviction is against their policy and that it 
will not reallocate the co-ops' spaces to any 
other group. The following day, Vice 
Chancellor for Undergraduate Affairs Joe 
Watson writes to the co-ops, stating that the 
UCB lease is "not an option." He considers 
2,000 collected signatures and numerous 
faculty leiters ··inconsequential." 

On March 15, the co-ops hold a mlly on 
the Hump to gamer support . 

The stalemate continues through the 
year. The administration forcibly changes 
the locks on the co-ops doors to the 
university key system on June 25. during 
summer break. The co-ops immediately 
have them removed. The administration 
persists. changing the locks again. The co-
ops decide not to remove them again. 

On October 29, the co-ops sign new 
lease with the UCB and the administrJtion. 
There is no mention of universi ty locks in 
the agreements. University locks remain on 
the co-op doors to this day.
