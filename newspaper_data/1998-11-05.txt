UCSD Parking Services 
Ignores Obvious Solutions 

UCS D's lack of student parking spaces (or yellow 
"S" spaces) is having a negative impact on student 
life and is not being addressed by Parking and 
Transportation Services in a timely manner. 

While several new zones have been created for 
student parking si nce the beginning of the year, the 
response to this si tuation has been far from adequate. 
The 100 or so new spaces near RIMAe is a start, but 
it is a mere drop in the bucket compared to the thou-
sands of idling cars. 

UCSD continues to suffer on a daily basis from an 
overdose of student commuters strugg ling to find 
parking in the farthest reaches of our huge campus. 

During peak hours, dozens of drivers can be seen 
circling the School of Medi cine parking lot or lined 
up in east and north parking whi Ie they wait for 
departing students to reach their cars. 

As a result of this overcrowding, students find 
themselves ei ther accounting for massive parking 
delays in their commute schedules or finding them-
selves late to class - or worse, not going to class at 
all. 

Many students have taken to subverting th sys-
tem by illegally parking in "A" or "B" spaces. ince 
the number of these premium space~ b clearly dis-
proportional to the number of " " spaces, studcnts 
often find these are the only rcmaining spots avail-
able to them. 

There are several currently unrealized solutions to 
thi s intolerable situation. First, the policy against 
bicycling on campu~ must he changed. By upgrading 
UCSD's paths to a bicyck -friendly system (such as 
those at UC Davi s or Santa Barbara), the univer-
sity would allow students to take advantage of a pre-
viously shunned, yet ecologically po~itivc, meth d of 
transportation. 

Rather than discouraging students from riding 
their bicycles to ,chool , the campus community 
ou ld support this solution and case the strain on stu-

dent parking altogether. 
Second, if the overpopUlation of UC D's oil-cam-

pus housing ontinues , the next several year~ will 
witness a drastic increase in the number of student 
commuters. Therefore, students must see some indi-
cation from the Parking and Transportation Services 
office that there are plans 10 construct some form of 
centralized, multi -level parking structure. 

Third, the massive advantage that "A" pennit 
parkers enjoy must be dis ontinued. "A" spaces are 
centralized (you won't find them in the north, east or 
medical school lots), overabundant (many of these 
spaces are empty moming, noon and night), and not 
accessible to students at any hour. Who pays the bills 
at lhi . school anyway? 

UCSD's student commuters are annoyed al the 
present slate of on-campus parking and concemed 
about the future. While it is uncertain whether the 
coming years will bring forth so lutionl>, rest assured 
that permit prices will follow their hi storic trend and 
continue to ri se.

maintained its numbers. 

While the GOP mainlains its 
maJorily on hOlh sides or the capilol

The majority in the House is not

In non·presidenlial eleclion years, 
as 1998 is. the pany in power has his-

Congressional scats . Inslead , 
Democrats have held their own. This 
is to the delighl of President Clinton. 
whose administration has caused the

Calirornia 's new li eUlenant governor 
and tilt: state 's Ii rst Lati no elected 10 a

promised by hi s campaign: support or 
a woman's right to choose. a ban on 
assault weapons and a top-to-bottom 
overhaul of California's public 
schools. 

As lieutenant governor, Davis acted 
as a Regent of Ihe Uni versi ly of 

alirornia system and a Trustee of Ihe 
California State niversily schools. 
His search for diversilY in highcr edu·

ea rl y $40 million dollars was 
spent to defeal Proposition 9, which 
saw vinually no opposition and passed

REpUBUCANS FAIL, FOR Now 
ANALYSIS: Having 
lost the election battle, 
GOP must look to win 
the presidential war. 
By Theodore Dokko 
Staff Wnter 

Tue,day, Nov. 3. 199M wa!> a 
day of hi storic proportions. For the 
first time in our nat ion'!> hi , tory, we 
have a governor who u~ed to be a 
profess ional wrestl er - avid 
wresting ran, wi ll have 110 trouble 
tn recognizing Jes.,c '~rhe Body" 
Ventura as the new governor of 
Minnesota. In addition, we elected 
two limner ri r t ,on." Georg\! W. 
!3u.,h and Jeh Bush, to the ,ta tl:-
hou,>\!s in Texa, and Florida. 

As voter\. we saw Irow worth -
Ie" pre-election 'pin i, put out by 
both politiw \Il', and pundil \. On 
one ., ide of the polit ICa l spe~trull1 
we heard Democrat., say ing that the 
I (16th ongress would have a 
delllocratically cont ro lled House f 
Repre,>cntati ves. On the other ., iue, 
we heard Repuhlicans say ing that 
their parly would pi~k up 40 scats 
in the House and that tlrey would 
have a Iilibuster-proof enate. 

It is evident that nobody was real-
ly right , and the Senate will maintain 
the same number 01 Democrats and 
Republkans. In the HOllse, the 
Democrats made a net ga i n. 

The Democrats not only dereat-
ed their Republican opponent s but 
they also defeated history. In 
midterm elections, the pres ident 's 
party has always lost :eats in the 
House, wi th a 27 -!>eat average 
delicil. The reason the Democrats 
won so many scats thi~ year was 
because of two major election-year 
issue : the economy and education. 

Exit polling shows Ihatthe over-
whelming majority of people feel 
that the nation is doing the sallie or 
heller economically than it wa, four 
years ago. This majority dcdded \0 
vote wi th the DClllocrats. In addi-
ti on,· the American people felt that 
the Democra\s wou ld deal with the 

problems raci ng education in a bet-
ter manner than would the 
Republ icans. It is evident that peo-
ple k el good ahout the economy 
and yet, at the same time, tbey have 

~O llle doubts about the future of this 
t:ountry, particularly with educatioll. 

The Democratic Pany did a 
wonderful Job or portraying them-
~c l ves as middle-of-the- road politi -
cians who would continue to garner 
in the prosperity that thi country is 
t:njuying. The Democrats aligned 
them e l ve~ with tho 'c invol ved in 
education and projected a united 
front. sltowlllg that they would be 
the one~ to get the job done. 

No matlcr how you look at it, 
the Republican Parly was the d ear. 
loscr in thi s year's elcctlon. The 
majori ty pany has fa iled to look at 
its past mbtakes and learn fill m 
thclII . The voter\ saw no rea l mcs-
!>agt: and deci ded tll ab,lI1don tlte 
Repuh lican [la rt y. The unly hint uj 
" rea l message that the GOP pre-
\c nted was "Monica Lewlllsky." 
and it b clear fro m the makeup of 
the IOoth ongress that people arc 
tired of the issue. 

The RepUblicans failed to take 
lessons from the 1992 and 1996 
elections: The president 's morals or 
appalling lat:k thereof do not t:ause 
votcrs to change their minds. 
Dcspite th is, the Republican 
National Commillee still ran politi-
cal advenisements that critit:ized the 
president for his actions and told vOl-
ers that they should not reward Bill 
Clinton but rather that they shou ld 
vot.: Republican. Such a message 
did not resonate with voters, the 
majority of them saying that the 
president and his actions played no 
innuence in their decisions thi s year. 

Moreover. the majori ty of 
R<:publicans failed to make inroads 
with voting blocks that they have 
had trouble with since thl: mid-
I 980s. Much like the past decade 
and a half, women , African 
Americans and Hispanics chose tn 
vote Democrat. It is not to say that 
the Republicans should be carrying 

the ethni t: or women's vote by over-
whelming margins, but they should 
not be losing those blocks by such 
large margins. 

There is, however, a glimmer of 
hope for the Republicans. This glim-
mer i in the Bush hrothers. Both of 
them, who arc Iluenl in Spanish, car-
ried large portions of the minority 
vote. Hopefully the GOP will follow

MONEY WINS IN SAN DIEGO 
ANALYSIS: 
Voters chao e develop-
ment: ballpark, free-
ways, Sea World 
By Jeffrey Barker 
ASSOCiate Opinion Editor 

an Diegans sighed with relief 
in the early morning hours ycster-
day as Congressman Brian Bilbray 
edged out his oppone'l1\ for 
California 's 49th di strict congres-
sional seal. All rive of San Diego's 
incumbent Congressmen were re-
elected. 

The race between Bilbray and 
Democrat Chri stine Kehoe was one 
of Sun Diego's only election deci-
sions which did not center around 
the dollar sign. The Sea World 
proposition and the down town ball-
park saw millions spent to promote 
their agenda, and San Diego 
schools wi II see their share or $1.5 
billion thanks to the overwhelming 
support for Proposition MM . 

San Diegans voted the status 
quo when it came to elected offi -
cials, but supported change and 
development within the t:ity. 

The millions of dollars spent 10 
promote Propositi on C and the 
redevelopment or 26 blocks of cast 
downtown were spent well. The 

vo te r~ supported a new ballpa~k , 
but not to a margin commensurate 
with the numher of dollars spent on 
the propos ition 's t:ampaign. 
Several weeks before the election. 

In addition to 
building ballparks, 
tall Shamu shrines 
and new elementary 
school cafeterias, 
San Diego will see 
the extension of 
freeways and 
development in two 
relatively rural parts 
of North County. 
the Sail Diegl) Union Tribune 
reportl:d that proponents of 
Propositi on C alit pent opponents 
7011 to I. Yet, support for 
Proposi tion C came from less than 
60 percent of voters. Perhaps it was 
it viclory for the little voice. 

Another David and Goliath 
story emerged from the Sea World 
initiative. Sea Worlo. without di s-
closure of the types of projecls it 
hopes to build. wan ts to be exempt 

f'ro m a t:oa~ t a l height lilllilUtion. 
The opposition to the bill. ~pending 
onl y $4 0 t:ompared to milli lln ~ 
spent hy Sea World, t:a mc within I 
prl'l'cnt 01 dd'eating the proposi-
tion. 

Two triumphs f'or privatcly 
owned businesses are , p'rhaps. 
ou tweighed by the passing of' 
Proposition MM . the $1.5 hillion 
school repair hand mell~urc . 

Further showing tha t edu 'ation 
is at the top of' the Civic agenda. 
voters overwhchlllngly supported 
sending money toward an Diego's 
publit: schools. all of' which will go 
IOward improving the facilities. 

In addition to hui Iding ball-
parks, tall Shamu shrines and new 
cafeterias, San Diego wi ll sec the 
extension of freeways and develop-
ment in two relatively Imal paris of 
North County. Propositions M and 
K carefully plan out the deve lop-
ment of twO undeveloped arcas, 
protecting so many ,ICres of land 
that they garnered endorsements 
from the Sierra luh. 

Money was the big player in 
San Diego elections , pushing 
through Proposition~ C and 0, 
whi t:h 11lIght have been defeated 
otherwi ·e. San Diegans voted more 
often than not for the statUS quo. 
whidl is more evidence that Illoney 
may ha ve skewed voters' ideas 
ahout radi t: al new development in 
America's Finest City.

Parties help to di sseminate

Council Attempts to 
Ameliorate Patdng 
Edi tor: 

As members of the A.S, 
Council, we have been hearing, and 
are very aware. of the current park -
ing situati on on campus. I wanted 
to take this time to explain what 
actions the A.S. Council has been 
taking to address the intolerable 
parking wnditions. 

Hea ring stories from students 
with accounts of searching for 
spaces in north parking and ea' t 
parking for over 30 minutes. I 
immediately scheduled a meeting 
with Greg Snee. director of 
Parking and Transportation 
Services. In this meeting, Snee and 
I attempted to lind solutions to the 
impacted parking si tuation . 
Hopefully. all students ha ve 
noticed 11 0 additional student 
spaces marked on the campus 
around RIMAe. This is perhaps 

The UCSD Guardian 

the first noticea ble victory the 
Associated Students has been able 
to accomplish in the area of park -
ing. Additionally. a new surface lot 
is set to open in the fa ll of 1999, 
adj acent to east parking (to be ser-
viced with addi ti onal shultles). The 
followi ng year. in the fall of 2000. 
two new parking stru(;lUre~ are set 
10 open. These will open before the 
groundbreak i ng for Eleanor 
Rooseve lt co llege. so as 10 prevent 
the loss of additional parking 
spaces when construction begins. 

Howeve r. aft er looking at the 
stat istics from the Transportation 
and Parking office, it is dear that 
thi s is not enough. The peak times 
for parki ng are Tuesdays and 
Thursdays from around II a. m. 10 
2 p.m. During Ihese limes. the sla-
ti st ics show that the mai n lots (a ll 
except the student lot nea r the 
medica l center) are 100 percent 
full. When people tell me they are 
looking for a spot for over 30 
minutes, the data supports thei r 
claim. 

Currently, the A.S, Council is 
looking into other options to 
address parking. An Executi ve

Busi ness Affairs Steven Relyea. 
along with the ass istant vice chan-
ce llor of Auxi li ary and Pl ant 
Services (to which parking reports) 
and the director of Housing and 
Dining Services, 

After meeting with Snee, it 
seems apparent that the problems 
of housing and parking are going to 
get much worse. Both problems are 
direct ly related (as more people are 
pushed off campus, more people 
are trying to commute and park on 
campus) and need to b.c addressed 
in a coordinated manner, 

The tinal option that is being 
considered would he done with the 
request that the administ ration 
takes thi s issue more seri ously, 
Currently, the A.S. Counci I is dis-
cussi ng the possibility of taking-
over a faculty lot for a week. While 
thi s tactic would be di sruptive and 
deviates from the Associated

dealing with the administration , it

Story Misrepresents 
Sigma Chi Fraternity 
Editor: 

Once again. I am very disap-
poi nted to see the Guardian 's 
attack on the Sigma Chi Fraternity. 
Monday's (Oct. 26, 1998) 
"Elsewhere" w lumn on the front 
page included the qui ck report of 
the tragedy of a Sigma Chi pledge 
attempting suici de in Mi ssiss ippi . 
The articl e seemed to be out of con-
text and pointed a lot o f blame to 
the fraternity itself. 

I personall y do not know the 
motives of thi s poor young man 
who tried to take his own life, and I 
am curiou s as to what hi s motives 
actually were, If the chapter at 
Miss issippi is fo und somehow 
responsible for the men'tal hea lth of 
their pledge. I assure you that the 
Sigma Chi Internati onal 
Headquarters wi II take the neces-
sary actions to both correct that 
chapte r and to uphold the va lues of 
Sigma hi.' 

My thoughts and prayers go out 
to this young man and hi s famil y. 
and the Sigma Chi chapter with 
which he is affiliatcd. 

At the same time, I will not 
stand fur the ncgat ive press thal ou r 
frate rn ity continually receives . 
T hes.: negative attacks on our fra-
ternity largely w lTIe from the igno-
rance uf peopl.: who do not under-
stand what a frat ernity can and 
should be. 

When r became a Sigma Chi. I 
took that h >nor on as a lifelong 
cOll1ll1itll1 n!. Sigl11a Chi is an inter-
national fraterni ty. and an event 
~uch a~ thi S reflech negatively on 
the rraternity as a whole . 

The article you r newspaper 
included on the front page is very 
<Dpinionated and quick to form con-
Clusions. I question the lack of fac-
tual information in this article, and 
I also quest ion the integ rity or the 
Guardio/l staff to publish such an 
accusatory arti cil: with little ev i-
dence included to support it. 

Most i rnportantly, the Sigma 
Chi Fralerni ty at UCSD does not 
condone any form of hazing. A 

pledg~ of our fraternity take, on 
many respol1sibilitic~ in hoth 
upholding the excellent ~tandards 
of Sigma Chi and rcspccting the 

te<lching~ and morals hi~ parent, 
have instilled in him. In our pledge 
program , we work to push a pledge 
to he a beller Illan hy cultivating in 
him an appreciation for our hi gh 
ideals of friendship, justice lind 
learning. Hazing and belilliing a 
p/t:dge has no place in purposeful 
li ving and therefore no place in our 
pledge program, 

Having a high sense of honor 
and ,t deep sense of personal 
responsibility arc standards by 
which we pledge men to our rrater-
nity. As you can clearly sec. hazing 
does not fit into these standards 
whatsuever. 

I ask that your staff research and 
present facts in your articles 
instead of ex ploi ting opinions, 
accusat ions and unwarranted con-
c lusion,. I strongly urge the 
Glll/rdillll not to stereotype organi-
I.ations or the people that they are 
made up or.

Story by 
SLIM 
STEIGER, 
Guardian Reporter 

or fans at SOMA on Oct. 29, the novelty of see-
ing the hand from the movie "Swingers" quick-

ly subsided, and wa~ replaced by sheer and utler 
amazement. Thc)' don't l:a ll it big band for nothing; 

Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was. in fact , larger than life in 
their wm;ert la,t Thursday. 

From the moment they an'ived on stage. Big Bad 
Voodoo Daddy grahbed Ihe :ludienl:e's attention with a 

pair of vice grip~, and refused to leI go until the end of the show. 
Between si nger Scotty Morris ' immense smi le and hassi t Dirk hu-
maker's sly smirk. the crowd could not help hut fall in love. The hom 
seclion pranced around the stage, sw inging their instruments bal:k 
and forth , The elltir.: hand displayed a heart-warming camaraderie. 

The hand 's commandi ng 
stage presence is surpassed only 
by its incredible talenl. Its line-
up boasts a driving rhythm sec-
ti on, which includes Kun 
"Boom-Boom" Doergren on 

I/J co~cert 
'<:"eVtew 

drums. Ihe ever-talented josh Levy on piano and the lovable Shumak-
er on stand-up bass. The band has also enlisted a hom section to rival 
any other, which inl:ludes Jeff Harris on trombone. Andy Rowley and 
Karl Hunter on sax and Glen '1'he Kid" Marhevka on trumpet. 

From the beginning of the show, the crowd was crazy with excite-
menl. Fans were far from disappointed with the high -energy perfor-
mance that Big Bad Voodoo Daddy deli vered. They pfayed most of 
the songs from their latest alhum, including those IcalUrcd in 
wingers. such as "You and Me and the B01lle Make Three Tonight" 

and "King of Swing." They delved into the Illambo wi th "Mambo 
Swing" and performed their "Mr. Pinstripe Suit:' a song for which 
they have just crcatl.!d a vicko, The hand also perfonned the classic 
song made immortal by "The BllIc~ Brothers," Cab Calloway'S 
"Minnie the Moocher," as well as a swingi ng rendi tion or the Disney 
favoritl.! " I Wanna Be Like You" from the "jungle Book ." 

Despite an obvious hes itation to play the song, the hoys could not 
allow their fricnd~ 10 go hOllie unsatisli.:d and linished with tlll:ir 
ramous "Daddy-D." All in all , /Jig Bad Voodoo Daddy plll on a show 
that was nothing b~ than awewmc and rarely equaled in the age of 
eleclnmic recording. The 1l111~icians proved once and for all that they 
are tndy a performance band. 

Playing over 200 shows in North Amcrica in the Ia.\t live years 
and being Icatured in a major 1lI0tion picture, might make 

the band seem inlimidating. To the contrary, the group 
is extremely personable and down to earth. 

Shumaker, Marhevka, Levy, Hunter. and 
Morris spoke on the idea of swing as a scene. 

ami the concern that it may all fade away. 
"Un less it becomes gimmick, it stays fun 

for everyone ". it \ all ahaut the llIu~ i c," 
Levy said . 

Morris also emphasized music as the 
key to:\ band" ~I"yi ng power. 

"Good music is not a novehy. Yes, the 
swing ~cen' is a scene. but great bands l:an 

emerge from scenes. This scene may come 
and go, but this hand has come to stay," he 
~aid . 
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has a large lollowing 

or underage fans but the band says thal doesn' t hath-
er it at all. 

"Younger crowds are what it 's all about," Hunter said. 
'T he younger crowd is beller, there's more purpose in the music," 

said Shumaker, smiling. 
Shumaker says the band plans to hit the studio again in 1999, and 

hopes to release a second mainslream album by that Christmas, 
Though the band prefers playing live, Shumaker says it can only

BLACK AND WHITE 
'Pleasantville' reveals too much in previews 

By Jeremy Gray 
Staff Writer 

Oncc again. Hollywood is guilty of thc 
hig he't ~ In - giving away way too much of a 
movie in the prev iew~. It \ a real shame, con-
,idering "Pleasant villc" is a quirky and erc-
ati ve nove lty piece that rcall y docsn' t dcserve 
to have all its ambit ion 't ri pped th rough ~ome

with David and Jennifer (Tobey Maguire and 
Reese Witherspoon, respecti vely), two mod-
ern teenager~ who ge t sucked through the 
television and inlo "Pleasant ville." 

But what beg ins as a clever take on the 
coming-of-age genre devo lves into a , ocio· 
logical sllldy of race relations, or in thi s case, . 
the hl ac k·and- whites vs. the quile literall y 
colored. It 's an unlikely direc ti on in a film so 
intent on developing characters, such as the 
housewik Betty (Juan Allen) who longs for 
P;I'" iOIl , or lhe neighborhood soda jerk (Jeff 
D.lIliel,) whu lea rns about li fe th rough art .

when it 's assumed George simply didn 't love 
her - he never knew what love was. When it 's 
revcaled later that hc ha, always loved her and 
Just didn 't know how to tap that cmotion. it's 
hard not to fecI sorry for him. Instead. his wife 
cheat s on u lov ing hu ~band, not a conse rvative

What rcally drivcs this 
\lick i, thc way color is 
contrastcd so vividly with 
hl ac k-u nd-whitc. Tllink of 
tho,e photos of the little 
boy holding a , ingle rcd 

rose and you 've got thc gist of it. The lengthy 
black-and-whitc introducti on makes the 
movie', first usc of color quite dramatic, repre-
sented here by, well. a single red rose. 

But as striking and beautiful as the color is, 
thc application of it is the most illogical part of 
the movie. The idea is that the color is insidc of 
each person, a spiritual third dimension of sorts, 
and it 's up to the individual to realize what brings 
out the color. I f you swallow that syrup, fine. But 
that doesn't explain why teenagc sex makes a 
clock colori zed but not the diner it is in. Since 
none of this coloration makcs ense, the color is 
more uf an artistic tool than a lugical one.

HEATED TUNES 
Blossoming band Firewater lights up the Casbah 
By Jeremy Gray 
Slaff Wnler 

Dircclly under a rout ine \li ghl pallern , Fi re-
water played a di vcr,e sct al the asbah on OCI. 
21) 10 lhc subdued plea~ure 01 a , mall Thursday-
night ':nJwd. Although they tried to , hake the 
walb with their eclectic blend of rock, instru-
l1Ientals and horn ~. lh' 1I10St shaking occurred 
C\cry ti me a plane \lew ovcrhead. 

Not many people n:al i/ e Firewatcr', ri,ing 
., talU ~. They'vc toured with Soul oughing, 
The Squirrel ut Zippers, The Jesus Li l ard 
and kelcton Key. Their udd sound is said to 
havc made , katepunh wear ya rlllulke~ and 
make fans dance the hor,1, 

This uniquc mix of klclmer. tango and 
bulgar debris is creatl:d by musicians Tod A 
on bass and vocals, Oren Kaplan on guitar, 
Hahn Rowe on violin, Gcorge Javori 0 11 
drums, Tim Otto on Saxophone, and Paul 
Wallfisch on piano and organ. 

After a few bands that are not worth men-
tioning, Firewater linally took the stage at 
II :30 p.m. The set opened with the fiery 
"Ponzi 's Thcmc," an in trumental that 

de monstrated the co mfort the band has when 
playing together. The song. an illegitimate 
cousin of the Spy Hunter theme, wove in sax-
ophone riffs that were nicely accentunted by 
kcyhoard so los. Of special note. the drummer 
seemed to be having a good time rubbing up 
against the llloracco player. 

Firewater's performance was playful and 
humorous, with lead singer Tod A providing 
mOM of the comi c relief as a Bible-spouti ng 
televangeli st fond of four-letter words. The 
instrumental jam ses, ion "EI Borracho 
(Ponl i's Relapse)" brought the mood of the 
audience up and showcased the unique COln-
hinalion of diverse instruments. 

Their new CD, Tire POll zi Sclreme, is as 
eclectic as their perrormance. It is refreshing 
to hear band members that are playful enough 
to bailIe back and forth with lillIe solos. But 
Firewater still takes their music very seriously. 

"That [their debut albuml wasn ' t just about 
sex , it was sex ," Tod explai ned to the BB 
afler recording Tire Pon-; Scheme. "Pure sex . 
But we 've moved on . We're into pyramid 
scams now."

ever, the DJs were able to pull it off 
wi thout a hitch," Trauma said. 

The event offered a wide variety 
of dance music, including different 
types of breakbeat, trance and hard-
core. The dub had thlee DJs who 

had not previously spun

have been with the cluh for some 
time, all shared their different styles 
and levels of experien.:e. 

'The diversity is beneficial ," 
Trauma said "However, a two-room 
set-up might work out best." 

The necess i t y for t IVO a re as 
became apparent by walching the 
energy level of thc crowd flUCluate 
throughout the night. 

"As soon as Andy went on it was 
a totally different party." Trauma 
said. " It was obvious Lhat the audi-
ence enjoyed all types of music 
played. However, the majority start-
ed dancing when DJ Bee Bee start-
ed spinning." 

DJ Bee Bee (Andy Livingston) 
spun a happy hardcore set that got 
everyone moving. Livingston is a 
great example uf one of the d ub's 
goals - to help people whu arc 
i nh.:rested in learning tu spin. TllO~e 
who have watched him cultivate his 
talent over the last year can say wi th 
cenuinty that LivingslOn has the 

potential and thc dedication to 
become an accomplished

, ay., the duh would 
like to see more stu-

of the club' purpo e is to provide 
the student population wi th an out-
let from everyday student life. 

The only minor downfalls of the 
night were a few "unruly" people in 
the Price Center area. 

"There were a couple of frat 
boys that were ·trolling through the 
Price Ce nter and decided to sti ck 
around and play like junior high 
kids by making fun of the people 
there," John Meki li , a Muir junior 
who attended the event, said. "One 
thing that the UCSD Greeks, if you 
can even call them 'Greeks,' need to 
reali ze is that their way of having 
fun is nOl the only cool way, not the 
only right way, and it is not neces-
sarily the best way. Everyone has 
the right to have fun however they 
choose, and they deserve to be 
respected too." 

The "rrat boys" refused to com-
ment or 10 have their names 
released. 

Trauma said the DJ dut> may 
hOSI another event this month. 

' 'Tentatively, we are hoping for 
the third weekend in November~ ' he 
said.

(LOSE TO BLOCKBUSTER, BUT NO (IGAR 
(Soldier' offers a star studded cast and production crew) but jails short on many levels 

By David Lee 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

"Soldier"' delinitely looked like 
a blockbuster hit on paper. The 
sc ript was wrillen by screenwri ter 
David Webb People, who coinci -
dentally also produced the sci- Ii 
classic "Blade Runner." The special 
effects personnel included director 
of photography, David Tatter~a ll of 
"Star Wars" fame and production 
designer, David Snyder who 
brought the world or "Blade Run-
ncr" onto the cel luloid mediulll . 
Splash in a chi 'eled Kurt Russe ll 
("Escape from New York") to play 
the leading man with upcoming ta l-
ent Jason Scott Lee (,'Dragon") as 
thl: vi lIain and you already have 
most of the lI1akings to a Holly-
wood hit. 

But wi th all the notoriety that 
the star, behind and in front of the 
screen carry, "Soldier" fa lls , han 
of an effective action-adventure. 

gradually nursed to health by these 
dcni7ens and just in time as the new 
breed of sold iers arri ve on the plan-
et. using the inhabitants for shoot-
ing practice. aturally, Todd gets 
angry. Todd begins to kill. And 
eventu ,lIly. Todd kills all the bad 
guys. 

Again. the plot is not so difTer-
ellt from other action-adventures 
who mude thei r mark on t he box 
offi ce chart s. What ditTereilliates 
"Soldier" from classics like "The 
Terminator" or "s'cape I rom New 
York" docs not necessarily lie in 
one or two mi~sillg components. In 
actuality. "Soldier" covers all thl! 
bases of what a good action-adven-
ture ~hould have - lillie dialogue, 
exp losions. a beautiful leading 
lady. an array of special effects, and 
more explosion~. But the movie 
rails to meet the stnndards of what 
other successful action tilms have 
set.

The movie's premise revolves 
arou nd Todd (Russe ll ). a hand-
picked sold ier who wa, trained 
fro m birth to tight. Although he and 
his squad of elite so ldiers an.: 
ex tremely "talented" at what they 
do (killing). they arc eventually 
replaced by a genetica lly superior 
squad of so ldiers. Unable to bedt 
the new squad 's captain Cain 607 
(Lee) in a duel, Todd is left ror dead 
in a remote planet that doubles as a 
garbage outpost. The planet. how-
ever. is peopled by a group of 
peaceful setllers who crash-landed 
on the desolate outpost. Todd is 

The action sequences are such 
examples of how "Soldier" fail s to 
mcet certain cri teria. The death 
match bet ween Todd and Cain 
lacks any sense 01 exci tement. The 
light coordi nator choreographed 
the scene according to princi ples 
real so ldiers ro llow. The resul t, 
however. lacks the pizazz and fl ash 
a Stcven Segal fi 1m might show-
case.

The direction of fight 
sequences arc also cluttered with 
multiple angles and hri ef shots of 
a kick or throw. Although the 
intent is noteworthy, the final 

effect is more or a headac he tu 
watch rather than a show of intri -
cate ci nematography. 

The relationship between Todd 
and Sandra (Connie ielson). who 
plays the nursi ng wife, is also a 
frustrating component in the lilm. 
The lilm docs an appropriate job 
building a relationship between the 
ullcmotional Todd and warm-

Dear Gin Blus~olm, 
1 know you ha ven' t been 

around lately, but I was wonder-
ing if you could stop training 
other bands to sound just like you. 
Thai way, we wouldn't have to 
suffer Ihrough albums like {eelillX 
stran XI' ly fine by Semisonic. 
They must hu vc been your ~tar 
pupils si nl:e Iheir melodi es ~eem 
to ha ve jumped right out 01 your 
firsl D. I hope you gave them an 
" A" for vocal s, too, be~ au ~e 
they've al:lually inje~ ted :1 lillIe 
life into your tried-and-true mel-
low harmonics and bland gui tar 
licks - an addition that reall y 
makes a song like "Gone to the 
Movies" seem fresh . 

BUI witb all due n!Spel:l, s ir~, I 
regrel to infornl you thai your time 
has passed, and it is only so long 
before Ihe public ~atches on. 
Should we expect one more album 
from Semisoni l: before tbey, too. 
disappear'? Or do you really think 
that their trivial "Closing Time" or 
suspiciously familiar "S inging in 
my Sleep" will push music in a 

brand new direction? Since Dan 
Wilson's lead vocals don't have 
enough siand-alone wength to 
carry this album, I'm guessing this 
wi ll be a new miserable experience 
all over again.

confident edge, possibly from real -
iJ:ing he's been a doormal one too 
many times. 

His vocals have matured, taking 
on more of a Toad feel. The tran~i ­
tion helps give songs like " Bite

when he sings, "Such an annoying 
conversati on I I'm sorry but I'm 
tired or trying ITo be some picture 
of c()mpa.~sion I ... and anyway it 
sounds like I'm lying." 

The UCSD Guardian 

On Sheik's lirst album, the e

didn' t have the heart to say he did-

he keeps a distance rrom compa~­

WATERSKIING 

To climax what was arguably the best 
baseball season in history, the New York 
Yankees swept the beloved Padres to win 
this year's World Series, Last weekend, 
the broom was in the hands of those on the 
UCSD Waterski team as it swept both the 
men's and women's competition at the 
UCSD Oktoberfesl. 

On the men' 
side, UCSD 
received contribu-
tions from unex-
pected members as 
it sought oUI first 
place. 

Sophomore 
Harley Wallace had a 
great day as he set 
personal bests in 
three evelllS: slalom, 
trick and jump. 
Freshman Tom Stout 
bolstered the squad, 
turning heads with an 
impressive performance in his first colle-
giate start. Senior Brett Fortenberry set a 

per~onal best in the jump event en route to 
a second-place finish overalL 

On the women 's side, the waterskiers 
continued to dominate. Similar to the 
men's team, underclassmen had signifi-
cant effects on their team's performance. 

Redshirt freshman Jodi Hottenstein 
won her first event ever, taking the trick. 
event and also tying for third in slalom. 
Freshman Targhee Orr finished second 
overall to cement UCSD's position at the 
top.

ICE HOCKEY 
Maybe it was post-Halloween jitters. 

Maybe it was the odd start time. Whatever 
it was, it sure affected the UCSD Ice 
Hockey team. 

In its Nov. I home opener game against 
Cal State Norlhridge, UCSD Hockey 
struggled to get things going, and fell 8-2. 

"We just weren ' t hungry today," 
Assistant Coach Peter Chu said. ''They 
didn't want the puck." 

From the get-go, UCSD knew its com-
petitors were trouble, as a CSUN forward 
squeaked one by the sleeping defense 
within a minute and a half of the opening 
period. Fortunately, the Northridge goal 
was an eye-opener, and UCSD's Chris 
Davis was quick to respond wilh the

did not completely fold. and regained the 
erve. but the TrilOn s were 100 strong. 

Freshman Jamie Wvods powered a ~ ros~ ­
coun kill , and Kathleen Hentz followed her 
teammate's kill with a game-winning ~mash 
of her own. 

After a brief half-time, the Triton charged 
onto the wun for another clean sweep. 

" We were so fired up," Benuer said. "We 
wanl ed 10 do it for the seni ors." 

And the senior~ wanted it for them~c l ve~, 
too. Brynjestad caille alive in game three, 
and was a w nstant tbreat on the court , 
pUlling away numerous kills. She wa ' always

Chulin. 

UCSD goalie Derek Stainer arose as 
well after the quick goal, and allowed only 
one more first period goal, coming during 
a Northridge power play. 

Down 2-1 after one period, UCSD 
entered the second period in good con-
tention. But Ihe second period proved to be 
a nightmare, as 4 Northridge goals matched 
by only I from the UCSD side killed any 
hopes of victory for the La Jolla squad. 

For a change of pace, UCSD brought 
in newcomer Jessica Barr who 

debuted in front of Ihl! net. Barr 
looks to be a viable as et as 
she came through with 

some trong saves and 
gave up only two goals. 

Perhaps between 
now and Saturday, 
UCSD will work up 

an appetite for its 
next competitor, 
Santa Clara.

RUGBY 
The UCSD rugby team will soon learn 

the negative side of last year's Division II 
National Championship. When a team is 
the best, everybody wants a piece of it. 
However, UCSD does not have to worry 
about Ulat during the preseason when the 
malches are geared toward improvement. 

This past Saturday the Ruggers hosted 
USD and San Diego State in Ihe annual 
San Diego Rugby Round Robin. UCSD 
finished the day with a 1-2-1 record, good 
enough for second place. 

In the first match of the day, UCSD set-
tled for a disappointing tie with USD, 7-7. 
The UCSD squad followed its morning 
performance with a L9-710 s to San Diego 
State. After falling behind in the first hal f, 
UCSD matched the Aztecs in the second 
half. Unfortunately, the second half effort 
was not enough. 

In the second round, UCSD turned out 
an impressive performance to beat USD, 
21·5, but then fell once again to State, 31-
7. 

''The key to a pre-sea on round robin 
like today 's is to show improvement," said 
rookie Coach Troy M eyer. " I think we're 
pleased with our performance today." 

UCSD continues its quest to defend its 
title with another preseason match against 
San Diego State this Saturday at I p.m. on 
Warren West Field.

Kueneillan and Punelli were abu there 

helping out UCSD's ~eni()r, with powerful 
serves and aggressivc dig" proving why the 
Tritons are in the hunt for " con~ec uti ve 
National Championsh ip. 

Before the No. 5 ranked Tritons embark on 
a consecutive title , Ihough, they wi IIlir~t trav-
el to Occ idental College to face thc Tigers for 
the ~ccond time :his season. In their la~t 
encounter, it was an embarrassment: UCSD 
toppled the Tigers in straight games, giving 
up only 4 points the entire rnat.:h. 

After aturday,> match, the Tritons will 
locus on the post~eason . Though the ~ite of 
the Western Regionals remains undecided. 
Noonan said that there is a so-so chance that 
the playoffs wi ll come hack to UCSD. 

"We still don't know where the regionals 
arc going to be, but it 's between us and SU 
Hayward," oonan sa id. 

For Hayward and Ihe rest of the Di vision 
III playofr contenders, they'd beller hope 
that the Tritons do not get to host the tour-
ney. because UCSD has heen basically 
unbeatable ( 13- 1) at home. Hayward. keep

Winter may be just around the corner, but it's just beginning to heat 

~ up on NCR Field. You see - it's the last week 01 the regular season for ./i Flag Football and that means big, big games all weekend. Some teams Foo~bCili are overhauling lhe playbooks looking for a little magic that will get them one more win and a playoff spot. Desperation can be very mollvatlng. The elite squads are trying to secure a top seed and send a message to 
any would be challengers. The playoff picture will no doubt be in focus following a frenzied final 
weekend of gridiron action. 

Three games stand out as the premier match ups this weekend. First. is a Men's AA block-
buster featuring LES GIRLS (3-0) who will be looking to extract a healthy cover charge from B-
BUILDING SACS (4-0) on Saturday. The top ranked strip club aficionados get it done with a 
smothering defense. They only give up 6 points per game. SACS can really bring it on offense 
which sets this one up to be a classic. The BPI eammittee says, ·SACS will hang in early and 
then blow 'em out with a late rally." 

A second of the Games-of-the-week offerings will have a struggling OJ'S DARK INFAMY (2-
1) trying to regain some respect Friday when they square off against the highly rated HUSKERS 
(4-0) in a Men's AM showdown. OJ's is the most confident team in 1M's, but has no reason to be. 
Personnel changes and a quarterback with a rating similar 10 Ryan Leaf's spell trouble. HUSK-
ERS should have no trouble scoring on an OJ's defense that gave up 25 last week and looks to 
be wilting. The BPI can't see this going any way but the HUSKER way. 

The Third spotlight game is a monster Coed AA contest which kicks off Saturday at 3pm. 
80lh JANINE LOVES TRAVIS (3-0) and the PANTHERS (4-0) feature grizzled old veterans. 
Everyone Involved In this matchup knows all the gooly coed rules (Ihey should. they helped write 
some of 'em). Each Side has extensive offenSive and defenSive schemes, stunts, rotations, shifts 
and formations. Both teams have hotheads that might rack up extensive unsportsmanlike yard-
age or get kicked out at a moments notice. Sounds likE: a toss up, right? Take the Panthers in an 
exciting Calilornia overtime! 

Here are some other great games thiS weekend Ihat Will be heating up the pfayoff picture.

1M TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS 
COMPETITIVE AGAIN! 

UCSD Tennis players smacked it around amongst the ghosts and (S goblins this past Halloween weekend, and to the surprise of no one, all of our players survived. In fact, Ihree of them, to be specific, kept their tennis . nerves together well enough to earn themselves the title of champions of 
TCftfti• this year's All-Campus Tennis Championships. Leif Krauss (Men's Open), Amrita Dhillon (Women's Open), and Ashok 

Pai (Men's Intermediate) are this year's Big Three in Tennis Singles and 
you couldn't ask for players with more solid games. Each of them were tested on more than ooe 
occasion during the two-day tournament and alllhree responded to the challenge. 

Krause came from the loser's bracket (a rarity in Men's Open play) and won three consecu-
tive matches by scores 018-4 with Ihe last a championship malch win over del ending champion 
Michael Gray. 

Dhillon, another veteran of this event, took out the lall firepower of newcomer Tori Robertson, 
8-3 to win the Women's Open Division. She won lour consecutive matches over the two days. 

Pal , a first year student from Rancho Bernardo, annexed the Men's Intermediate crown 
with four consecutive wins also, including a solid 8-4 win over Adam Ochsner in the linals. 

All finalists won special dinner gilt certificates to either Trophy's or TG I Fridays for their 
Iremendous play over the two-day event. Congralulations to all of our new champs!
