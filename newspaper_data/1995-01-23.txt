DAVIS - UC Davis faculty 
recently voted to halt a two-
part investigation into 
discrepencies between the 
salaries of male and female 
staff. The original study found 
that women's salaries were 
less than men's in 44 out of 48 
groupS' at UCD. According to 
Agritultural Economics 
Professor Quirino Paris, the 
initial study did not account 
for qualitative factors. Paris 
said that the researchers 
should not be allowed to 
review personnel files, which 
would have been the next 
stage of the investigation, 
without evidence of 
discrepencies. "There would 
be so much time fishing for a 
problem that it is totally 
unwarranted " Paris said.

Regents Say Fee Hikes Necessary 
FUNDING: State offers

at least 46 percent by 1998-99, were a hot 
topic of debate during the Board of Regents 
review of the governor's budget, to be voted 
upon at a later meeting.

"To me the center is student fees," said 
David Flinn, regent and UC Alumni Asso-
ciations president. "I believe that every 
regent has made a pact in his or her minds 
to the students and families of the Univer-
sity of California that fees would increase 
only if there is no other place to find money."

SAN FRANCISCO - It appears that UC 
fee increases will continue until the end of 
the century, if the regents approve the four-
year budget compact with the governor. At 
Thursday's UC Board of Regents meeting, 
UC President Jack Peltason hailed the plan 
as "a turning point for the university."

State Prison Funding Could Surpass 
Higher Education for First Time Ever 
PRIORITY: Colleges and cor-
rections department in 'head-to-
head' competition for funds 
By Joy Taylor 
Guardian Reporter 

For the first time in California history, the 
state may be trading school books for steel bars. If 
Gov. Pete Wilson 's proposed budget is approved 
by the Legislature later this year, more state funds 
will be spent on prison than on the Universi ty of 
Cali fornia and California State Uni ersity schools 
combined. 

However, the proposed budget may not appear 
to provide more funding to correction facilitie. 
Unlike past years, Wilson ha cho en to group the 
community colleges with the UCs and the CSUs 
so that their combined proportion of the budget 
which is 10 percent, appears to equal that of prison 

systems. 
However, once the community college allow-

ance of approximately three percent has been 
subtracted, higher education in California will 
receive less money than prisons. 

Vincent Shiraldi, executive director of the Cen-
teronJuvenileand Criminal Justice (CJCJ), called 
this discrepancy an " ... accounti ng sleight of hand. " 
Gov. Wilson and his financial pres secretary 
were unavailable for comment. 

In 1984, the state budget awarded two and a 
half time as much money to higher education 
than it gave to corrections. In 1995, universities 
expect to receive less each year. According to 
Associate Director of the California Higher Edu-
cation Policy Center Joni Finney, the state budget 
place higher education and the Department of 
Corrections in "direct ... head-to-head competi-
tion".

Decries 
Mfirmative 
Action 
PROPOSAL: Regent Ward 
Connerly wants to gradually 
'phase out the program 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 
SAN FRANCISCO -In a tense meeting of 
the UC Board of Regents Thursday, Regent 
Ward Connerly gave emotional testimony 
calling for the "phasing out" of affirmative 
action in higher education. 

Connerly, one of two black regents, an-
nounced his decision to tackle this sensitive 
issue within weeks of Gov. Pete Wilson 's 
call to eliminate affirmative action programs 
in California. Wilson appointed Connerly to 
the Board of Regents in 1993. 

Connerly said that while he has always 
tried to be open to different points of view, 
he felt that he must take action against such 
an unfair practice. 

"I always felt that my job as a regent is 
not to turn my head when there 's something 
with which I fundamentally disagree," he 
said. "I tell you with every fiber of my being 
that what we ' re doing is inequitable to cer-
tain people." 

Claiming that the press has distorted his 
intentions, Connerly said that he does not 
want to end affirmative action but to "phase 
out" the current policy and put "something 
in its place that is fair." However, he said he 
did not know what should replace it. 

His indictment of affirmative action re-
ceived a cautious response from the other 
regents. 

Reflecting the sentiments of many of his 
older colleagues, Student Regent Terrence 
Wooten said, " It scares me that we are even 
considering changing affirmative action, but 
I don't want the university to be forced to 
change. We mustdo all we can to hold to our 
motto as a beacon of light and find a better 
model." 

Connerly did not provide evidence of 
any detrimental effects of affirmative ac-
tion, but aid that the program morally de-
generates ethnic minoritie . 

"We are in fact contributing to the fact

New Student Regent 
Has 'Radical' Agenda 
omeE: Grad student Edward Gomez said he will 
try to drive home reality of student lives to regents 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

I don 'tthink it is fairforotherpeople 
to go through what I ' ve gone 
through. Why should people have to 
choose between having a decent life 
and getting an education for a de-
cent future?" 

SAN FRANCISCO - UC River-
side history graduate student Ed-
ward Gome~ sat like a man with a 
purpose while he waited his turn to 
be interviewed for student regent. 
He had a " progressive agenda," he 

Gomez said he also wanted to 

said. 
Gomez, one of 

three nominees who 
included UCSD's 
Naomi Falk, was 
appointed Student 
Regent by a four-
person University of 
Califonia Regents 
committee last Fri-
day. 

Saying that he 
hopes to make the 
board more student-
oriented,Gomez 
said that the regents 
need "to look be-
yond money and 
begin to realize that 
people are human 
beings and have 
other needs." 

Falk, who is a 
representative to the 
University of Cali-
fornia Students As-
sociation (UCSA) 
along with Gomez, 
said she thinks 
Gomez will make a 
good student advo-
cate. "He will speak 
out; he won't be in-
timidated, " Falk 
said. " He ' s very 
radical and very in-
tune with students' 
needs." 

At times work-
ing 72 hours per 
week while attend-
ing college, Gomez 
said he believes he 
can convey to the 

push for greater accessibility for 

"I'm currently 
workillithree

transfer students, 
saying thatonlyone 
out of 120 commu-
nity college students 
transfer to the UC 
system. He called 
the UC's target rate 
of enrolling one per-
cent of community 
college students " lu-
dicrous." "Let 's try 
a little harder," he 
said. 

Claimingthatthe 
regents have mis-
conceptions about 
students, Gomez 
asked, " How can 
they say that stu-
dents don't care 
anymore; they don't 
want to study? I'd 
say most of them 
want to study and 
that's why they're 
here. They're not 
playing games." 

He said the 
governor's pro-
posed budget in-
crease of two per-
cent, instead of the 
regents' request of 
a 7.9 percent boost, 
was "not a good at-
tempt," but that he 
will wait and see 
what the regents do. 

Gomez has been 
a student in all lev-
els of the California 

- Edwlrd Gomez higher education 
UC Student Regent system, earning his 

other regents the troubles of a finan-
cially strained student. " I'm part of 
the system they 've created, " he said. 
" It does work, but I want them to 
know it doesn't work the way it 
should work. It could be better." 

A.A. at Los Ange-
les City College and transferring to 
Cal State Los Angeles for his 
bachelor's degree. In addition to 
serving on the UCSA Fees and Fi-
nancial Aid Committee, Gomez is 
the external vice president of the 
UCR Graduate Student Association. Gomez said his top priorities are 

ffordability and accessibility. " I 'm 
currently working three jobs to put 
myself where I'm at," he added. " I 
don't want that for other people and 

His one-year term will begin 
when Terrence Wooten, also from 
UCR, steps down as student regent 
on June 30.

Gospe. Choir Performance 
Honon Martin Luther KIng, Jr. 

The UCSD Gospel Choir will celebrate the late Dr. 
Martin Luther King with a concert of gospel and 
spiritual music at the Recreational Intermural Athletic 
Complex (RIMAC) facility on Wed., Jan. 25 at 8 p.m., 
as part of RIMAC's opening ceremonies. Professor of 
Music Kenneth Anderson will direct the 600 member 
choir, the largest gospel group in Southem Califomia. 

Performing with the UCSD choir will be Julia Smith, 
a musical fixture and patriarch in the Mount Olive 
Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and Zelia Denny, who 
is affiliated with the Greater Jackson Memorial CooIC. 

The choir itself was created in 1972 when a few 
staff and students wanted to Sing gospel and spiritual 
songs. When Ken Anderson, a former accompanist for 
the choir, assumed leadership of the group during the 
1989-90 school year, the gospel choir's membership 
grew rapidly. During the 1992-93 concert season, the 
choir claimed over 1500 members. Today, the choir 
maintains its size with close to 500 performers. The 
UCSD Gospel Choir performs throughout the school 
year at locations around San Diego. 

The concert is free to the public. For more informa-
tion, call 534-5404 or 534-3229.

IDUCAtION AND HARD "M. college students can get an educa-tion, according 10 the CJCJ. 
In IIle last decade, IIle percentage of IIle 
state general fund that Is deIIoled 10 
corrections (jaIls. prisons, etc.) has risen 
sharply, while the percentage lOire to 

h~r education has declined. 

PRISONS:

prisons, no new ues 
Continued from peee 1 

Franklin Zimring, director of 
Boalt Hall's Earl Warren Legal In-
stitute agreed. " In the fiscally 
strained 1990s, California's prison 
population and its school budget are 
linked as never before. The un-
quenchable appetite for expanding 
prisons is in zero-sum competition 
with other essential services." 

In the last decade, California has 
built no new UCcampuses,one new 
CSU campus and 19 prisons. 

Below are IIle number of students from 
california's COllege systems who can be 
supported with IIle same amount of money 
required to confine one prisoner for a year. 

In addition, with the passage of 
the "three strikes" crime bill and the 
projected doubling of the prison 
population by the year 2000, an es-
timated 17 new prisons will be 
needed to cope with the influx. The 
California Department of ~rrec­
lions estimates that it will need a 
$6.7 billion funding increase to 
implement the new bill. 

According to Mike Godfrey of 
the CJCJ, the "three strikes" bill 
will result in decreased funding for 
Califonia higher education. "I think 
there is a direct correlation between 
the two." 

For the price of incarcerating one 
third-time burglar, 200 community 

A statement from the University 
of California Students Association 
quoted Shiraldi as saying, "In Gov. 
Wilson's first State of the State Ad-
dress, he called for a state which 
emphasized 'prevention over ware-
housing: In this year's budget, he 
is ... in effect, saying it is more im-
portant to punish than to educate." 

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Tom Debley said that 
the UC asked for a 7.9 percent in-
crease in state funding for this year's 
budget. However, in Wilson's four-
yea r plan for the UC, the universi ty 
would only receive a two percent 
increase this year and a four percent 
increase for each of the following 
three years. 

Although Debley said that state 
funding was much lower than ex-
pected and would have a "severe 
impact" on the UC system, he added 
that themulti-yearcommitment was 
"unprecedented. " 

"It gives us a vision out into the 
future which will enable us to plan," 
Debley added. 

However, with a projected in-
crease of 40,000 new UC students 
by the year 2000, this funding will 
be further stretched and the burden

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 

and Straight Men's 

Though both gay men and 
lesbians are su bjected to 
harrassment, studies show 
that gay men are more 
likely to suffer violent abuse 

merica's unrelenting refusal 
to accept the homosexual 

lifestyle differs greatly in 
its manifestation toward 

homosexual males and homosexual females. 
According to statistics and the media, it is the 
gay man who suffers more violent attacks as 
a result of his sexual orientation. That is not 
to say that lesbians are never violently tar-
geted for their sexual orientation, but verbal 
harassment is the most common form of at-
tack which they endure. 

According to Gregory Herek and Kevin 
Berrill's Hate Crimes, "Males generally ex-
perienced greater levels of anti-gay verbal ha-
rassment (by non-family members), threats, 
victimization in school and by police, and 
most types of physical violence and intimi-
dation .... Lesbians, on the other hand, gener-
ally experienced higher rates of verbal harass-
menL .. " 

A 1993 Los Angeles 
County Commission on 
Human Relations study 
reported that out of the 
total number of hate 
crimes against minority 
groups, homosexual 
males were the most fre-
quent target. 

For the first time in the 
history of the study, be-
gun in 1980, gays were 
No. 1 on the list. In all, 
211 hate crimes were directed toward gay 
men, whereas 30 were directed toward lesbi-
ans. 

Why is it that homosexual males are vic-
tims of violence more often than homosexual 
females? The heterosexual male instigates 
most of the violence and he is more concerned 
with punishing gays than lesbians for their 
"deviant" lifestyles. 

In American society, the stereotypical man 
is supposed to be a protector, a paragon of 

strength and virility. As a child, he is told to 
hold back the tears when the baseball clocks 
him in the face. This ideology of upbringing 
does not create an environment which is con-
ducive to emotional development and matu-
ration. 

Some boys experience homosexual feel-
ings or tendencieswhich pass away with ado-
lescence. However, these feelings sometimes 
persist. These boys are confused because their 
impulses do not match their up-
bringing or prevalent societal 
norms. They may ignore 
their feelings and find 
relationships with 
women which are never 
satisfying, and they may chan-
nel their emotion into aggression 
against those they fear they are becoming. 

In other cases, these gay-bashers are not 
"closet queens," but are simply disgusted with 

the gay man's rejection of 
traditional male identity. 

The male gender has a 
distinguished history of 
dominance which the het-
erosexual man reveres, as 
illustrated by today '5 con-
tinuing control over soci· 
ety by males. 

Deviation from the 
traditional gender role 
may not only insult het· 
erosexual males, but may 

threaten them IS well. He may feel that he is 
not needed IS much in today's society. As a 
result ofthis threat, he may also be disgusted 
by the physical act of love between two ho· 
mosexual males. He Sees anal sex as submis· 
sive and demoralizing. This disgust may add 
to the iault. Whether the aggressors against 
gay men are latent homosexuals or hetero· 
sexuals, the effect is the same: Homosexuals 
are labeled IS "fags," "queen," "fairies" or 
"pansies, " and are attacked because of the in· 

security or machismo of their tellow 
males. 

Lesbians do not face the same deliberate, 
directed violence which gay men face. As 
women, they fear attack on a more general 
level, just as any heterosexual woman might. 
Yet, violence is not as prevalent because het· 
erosexual men often do not feel as threatened 
by, or as disgusted with, homosexual females. 
There are several reasons for this. 

Men, throughout history, have not given 
much importance to the female gender role. 
This prejudice has not completely died 
away, even in today's "enlightened" soci· 
ety. The heterosexual tends to not give much 
consideration to women, regardless of 
sexual orientation. 

In addition, many straight men find the 
idea or image of two sexually involved 
women erotic. Many forms of pornography 
depict female homosexual acts. This appeal, 
however, has its limitations. It seems that 
most heterosexual men only want to see two 
beautiful, feminine "lipstick lesbians," and 
not two androgynoua "butch lesbians," hav. 
inllCxual relations. 

Monday, January 23, 1995 

Additionally, many heterosexual men find 
the forms of lesbian intercourse, such as oral 
sex and "prosthetic sex," analogous to the 
sexual acts which he could perform with his 
female lover. This makes these relations ac-
ceptable and inoffensive. 

Whatever the underlying causes may be, 
straight women tend to simply accept and for 
the most part respect, the choices homosexual 
women have made and do not feel that they 
threaten their womanhood. 

Women's tolerance extends fo male ho· 
mosexuals as well, although it is irrelevant 
to the issue of violence, since it is rare that a 
woman would endanger herself by physically 
abusing a male. 

While lesbians escape the punishment of 
straight men '5 fears to some degree, they 
suffer for their lifestyle in other ways. The 
gay·bashing issue is not wholly sexual, IS 
one might think, but based on gender roles. 
American society's rigid standards for these 
roles must change to ease tension between 
gay and straight :nen.

INTERVIEW: The Guardian speaks with Judith Halberstam, professor of literature, queer theory and feminist theory 

CLOSING THE ORIENTATION GAP 
Interview by An". Valaman 
Opinion Editor 
and Christina aalne 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Last Friday, we had the oppor-
tunity 1'0 ' interview Judith 
Halberstam, professor of literature, 
feminist theory and queer theory at 
UCSD. Halberstam was a coordi-
nator of the Gay/Lesbian/Queer 
Knowledges and Identities for the 
1990s conference, which was held 
at UCSD Jan. 20-21. 
I under.tand you teach a 
cIau on "HI' theory. 

Yeah. I've taught several classes.

rectInC It tow.d that? 

Well, part of what this con-
ference is about is examining 
the many different institution-
alized forms that homophobia 
might take. So, it would be very 
difficult, and I think it would 
be erroneous and not very help-
ful, to say, 'Oh, it's hetero· 
sexual men, and particularly 
heterosexual white men who 
are homophobic.' There is a 
relationship that you could map 
out and that might be interest-
ing to talk about in terms of the 
relationship between dominant 

do a very wide range of social 
analysis .. .. And that's one of the 
reasons that queer studies has 
become a major academic field 
in recent years, because people 
are interested in that question: 
Why we persist in being 
homophobic in a society that 
really should not necessarily be 
threatened by the existence of 
gay men and lesbians. There's 
no real gain ....

ment. There are all kinds of harass-
ment this society [gives) out to 
queers, and it 's really important to 
acknowledge the way it is different 
to be a gay man in this culture than 
it is to be a lesbian. Some of the 
ways in which [they ' re) different 
[are] represented in terms of the 
kind ofviolence that 's visited upon 
gay men versus the kind of violence 
visited upon lesbians. I don' t think 
you can measure those violences 
against each other. 

I've taught a graduate seminar on 
queer theory that looks at the ma-
jor currents ... academic currents ... 
in this new emerging field that's 
called queer theory. And then I've 
taught some undergraduate classes 
that have various focuses. One was 
on gay and le!;bian literature. One 
was on gay, lesbian and queer cul-
ture - that was the most recent one. 
And then I taught a class last quar-
ter on lesbian feminism. So, there 
[are) also classes offered on cam-
pus from the political science de-
partment, from the sociology de-
partment, with gay and lesbian 
themes. There are quite a few 
course options, at the moment, in 
queer studies. 

white male heterosexuality and People stereotype le.blan women as 
homophobia, but it 's certainly beIng masculine. But It's alao like 
not the only one. . thedr&gqueenpersona.lt'sapersona 

We propagate homophobIa that many lesblana take on wIllingly 
in this society th~ough ' po.ltlvely and affIrmatIvely. W~ 
churches, thr~ugh SCIence, re.pect, In the gay and lesbian 
through th~ famll~, through TV, culture, the butch IdentIty. 

It 's really hard to answer 
those quantitative questions. I 
think it goes up and down. I 
think, for example, the AIDS 
cnsls has deepened 
homophobia in religious and 
right-wing groups, because [it) 
becomes the justification for 
homophobia in the way these 
groups have pinned AIDS 

Maybe gay men, in certain cir-
cumstances, are more likely to be 
gay .bashed. Often , lesbians are 
more likely to lose custody of their 
children, to maybe be forced into 
closeted work situations. There 's no 
way of really knowing. So, the vio-
lence against gay men and lesbians 
may be different, but they ' re not 
more or less depending on whether 
they ' re gay or whether they ' re les-
bian. Because we live in a culture 
that values a certain form of mas-
culinity, very often gay men are 
punished physically. That's very, 
very true. Gay men are punished 
physically, because very often, het-
erosexual men want to prove some-
thing about their own masculinity. 
That 's been given as a reason for 
gay-bashing. But many lesbians are 
beiQg physically attacked all the 
time in our culture, precisely for 
being a lesbian. For example, lesbi-
ans who are particularly butch in ap-
pearance are very often greeted with 
aggressive violent actions for not 
being properly feminine .... 

through fll~ . It s a cultural _ Judith H.lberstam 
homophobIa, rather than a 
group of people who are trying to 
keep queers in their place. There are 
social forces that want to hold gay 
and lesbians back, or discriminate 
against them or perpetuate 
homophobia. But it's not really 
helpful to think about what indi-
viduals are involved in that.

So, for example, when you teach 
a class on gaynesbian/queer culture 
on this campus, I think that one of 
the things you ' re looking at is both 
the forms that homophobia have 
taken, historically and institution-
ally, and then the forms of queer

resistance to homophobia which are 
always going on at the same time. 
And then you want to look at issues 
like assimilation or what happens 
when Hollywood embraces the 
queer [lifestyle), giving so-called 
positive images of gay men and les-
bians. That 's not always desirable 
either, because it can be a very cari-
catured or white-washed depiction 
of queer life. So, if you wanted to 
really talk about either what causes 
homophobia, what causes 
homophobia to continue, what per-
petuates homophobia, you have to 

down as a gay disease. So, in the 
age of AIDS, it would be very, very 
difficult to claim that homophobia 
is decreasing. There is certainly 
more visibility nowadays for gay 
men and lesbians, but that doesn ' t 
correlate necessarily to a decrease 
in the amount of homophobia that's 
being expressed publicly. So, I 
wouldn't want to make that claim.

needed to band together for some 
cause, perhaps they could find a 
nonviolent solution to their prob-
lem. Unforlunately, this is not a 
likely scenario. Homosexual males 
threaten the Iraditional order and hi-
erarchy of society to a more pro-
found extent than do homosexual fe-
males, and they pay the price for it 
with blood. 

Below are the results of a study in which 796 gays and 561 
lesbians classified the different abuses they face.

Continued from page 5 
WIld .,. the ImpllCIItIona of 
th. word. "butch" .ncI ""p-
stick ....... n"? AI ....... of-
f ..... ve or 1ICCUm.? 

In any minority, whether it's a 
racial minority or a sexual minor-
ity,lhere will be a vernacular. There 
will be a set of terms that people use 
among themselves, in friendly 
ways, in affinnative ways, in ways 
that attempt to name differences 
within a category. If you say, "les-
bian," t hat's a very large category. 
And at this point, it's a very large 
cullural minority. We, lesbians and 
gay men, have huge vocabularies 
when referring to each other: 
queens, divas, butches, lipstick les-
bians, drag queens, femmes, ... 
slaves, masters, whatever. There are 
a number of terms, some of which 
refer to sexual acts and activities and 
preferences, some of which do not 
- some of which are applied to 
gender identification, some of 
which are not. So, one of the really 
wonderful parts of queer culture is 

t~at we have this very, very rich 
minority culture. And one of the fac-
ets of that is a huge vocabulary for 
talking about what it is we do sexu-
ally and what it is we do as lesbians 
and as gay men. 

U's hard to find something simi-
lar in heterosexual culture. In fact, 
what are the alternatives to saying 
heterosexual? Straight? Is that it? 
Why is it heterosexuals haven't de-
veloped higher languages ... there 
are fetishes, s&m, or whatever. It's 
because it 's not an endangered com-
munity. They don't have the same 
kind of pressures. There's not these 
interesting discussions about what

it is we do, why we do it, how we 
do it, and so on .... Butch refers to 
women who affirmatively identify, 
in some way, as masculine. It can 
be used as a put-down if you say, 
"That woman is so ugly. She's so 
butch." In a heterosexual context, 
that's a put-down .... Whereas in a 
lesbian context, it can be - it isn't 
always, but it can ... mean - "that 
woman really takes on her mascu-
linity in a way that is sexy." That is 
the image of lesbians that is stereo-
typed . People stereotype lesbian 
women as being masculine. But it's 
also like the drag queen persona. It's 
a persona that many lesbians take 
on willingly, positively and affirma-
tively. We respect, in the gay and 
lesbian culture, the butch identity. 

Butch is a very important word, 
especially nowadays, and it 's often 
used with its other [meaning). There 
are a whole other set (of lesbians] 
that you might call in your vocabu-
lary, "lipstick lesbians," who affir-
matively identify with the category 
"feminine," to the point that they 
may be more feminine than the 
mythical, average straight woman. 
for example, there's a bar in L.A. 
called "Girl Bar," which tends to be 
femme women. If you went in there, 
you wouldn't really know, if you 
were looking for stereotypes of les-
bians, that you were in a lesbian 
context, because the women are al-
most indistinguishable from straight 
women. So, there are all kinds of 
varieties and forms that lesbian per-
formances can take in this cuUure 
at this point.. ..

lence? 
When men are .turned on by the 

idea of lesbian sex ... it is a male fan-
tasy construction of what lesbians 
mayor may not do together in bed. 
The fantasy is fueled by the idea 
that the women are performing for 
a man or that the sex is foreplay for 
"real" sex. The correlation between 
that and male violence against les-
bians is not worth making. That's 
just a construction. Especially in 
pornography. You ' re not looking at 
lesbians. You ' re looking at two 
women who are being paid to touch 
each other in ways that are neither 
representative of the ways lesbians 
make love nor how they conceive 
their own identities. 
WIurt .,. rour hopea for the 
conferenc.? 

The conference has been in plan-
ning for about a year now. We' re 
hoping that the conference will 
bring to the campus some cutting-
edge work that's being done in 
queer theory, in queer studies, from 
all over the country. We have very ... 
well-respected scholars coming in 
to speak. We' re hoping this gener-
ates a more genuine conversation 
about queer issues on this campus, 
that people sit up and take note .... 
Lots of people are interested in 
queer theory right now, especially 
in the humanities, and this is a 
showcase, a kind of academic and 
an extra-academic showcase for the 
kind of work people do under the 
heading of "queer" nationwide. 
Also, we'll talk about the relation-
ship between queer, or gay and les-
bian issues, issues of sexuality, is-
sues of race ... issues of science, 
technology, bodies. It 's a very wide-
ranging group of speakers with 
wide-ranging topics ....

may fall on the students themselves. 

Debley said that the UC system 
anticipates a fee increase of at least 
10 percent each year over the next 
several years. 

When The Los Angeles Times 
conducted a survey on Apt'iI2, 1994, 
asking Californians whether they 
were prepared to accept cuts in the 
state higher education budget to fund 
the "three strikes" bill, 72 percent 
said they were unwilling,22 percent 
said they were willing and six per-
cent said they did not know. 

According to UC Berkeley Pro-
fessor of Jurisprudence and Social 
Policy Jerome Skolnick, "families 
sending their children to public uni-
versities need to know that, when 
they pay their annual tuition in-
creases, they're not paying for bet-
ter educations, they're paying for 
prisons."

Peftason Makes Resignation Official 
PRESIDENT: UC 
chief says he has 
accomplished his task 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 
SAN FRANCISCO - Saying that 
his work at the University of Cali-
fornia is complete, UC President 
Jack Peltason officially gave his 
anticipated retirement announce-
ment at Friday's regents meeting. 

The 71-year-old administrator 
postponed his retirement from 
academia two-and-a-half years ago 
10 help steer the UC system oul of its 
economic troubles. He accepted the 
post on a temporary basis, expect. 
ing to serve only the three-year term. 
He said he hopes 10 be out by Octo-
ber, when the three years are up. 

"I'm not too old, I'm not too 
tired, I'm not mad," Peltason said in 
a press conference. "I just believe 
it's best forthe university to pass the 
baton on to the nexl person." 

125 percent and allowed flCUlty sala-
ries to drop 7.5 percent below com-
parable institutions. Fees are ex-
pected to rise by 10 percent for each 
of the next four yt:3rs, according to 
the governor's proposed budget. 

In an attempt to protect the qual-
ity of the university, Peltason en-
acted a new fee policy which bases 
fee levels on the amount needed to 
maintain instructional costs. He ex-
pressed confidence that the 
governor's compact with the uni-
versity to increase state funding for 
the next few years will get the UC 
system back on Irack. 

"I'm happy to say that the work 
I signed on to do is essentially com-
pleted," Peltason said. "The Cali-
fornia economy is now recovering 
and the Governor has given us wel-
come indications that sufficient 
funding will be available to enable 

. the university to carry out its current 
programs. " 

said that he will appoint a commit-
tee next week to conduct an interna-
tional search for Peltason 's succes-
sor. 

"There is no heir apparent," 
Leach said in a press conference. 
"From my point of view, it will be a 
totally level playing field. The un i-
versity deserves the very best qual-
ity ." 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, a main contender for the 
job in 1992, is a likely candidate for 
this year's opening. UC Provost 
Walter Massey and UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Chang Lien Tien have 
also been rumored as prospects. 

Peltason began his work at the 
University of California in 1964 as 
vice chancellor of academic affairs 
at UC Irvine, which he helped to 
establish. In 1967, he was named 
chancellor at University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign, and served 
as president of the American Coun-
cil on Education in Washington, 
D.C., from 1977 to 1984. He then 
returned to UC Irvine to become the 
campus's second chancellor before 
becoming UC president. 

Appointed during one of the 
worsl recessions in California's his-
tory, Peltason inherited many ofthe 
budgetary problems his administra-
tion has faced . Facing $433 million 
in budget cuts si nce 1990, the re-
gents have increased student fees by 

Regent Meredith Khachigian, 
who asked Peltason in 1992 to take 
on the difficult task of directing 
163,000 students on nine campuses, 
said "My opinion then was thatJack 
Peltason was the right person to lead 
this university, and I never swayed 
from that position." 

Board Chairman Howard Leach 

A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of 
the University of Missouri, Peltason 
earned his Ph.D. from Princeton in 
1947. 

Tom 8allcley/Gu8ll1lan 
uc PrMIdent Jilek Peituon .nnounced Friday tlult he pl .... to

UC BUDGET WOES 
Below are the requested and granted budget 
increases for the 1995-96 school year. All figures 
are in millions. 

BUDGET: 
Student regent urges 
fight against fees 
Continued from peee 1 
hikes for undergraduate and pro-
fessional students. 

Flinn said he would not vote 
for the budget until he was con-
vinced the regents did "every-
thing we could do" to find fund-
ing sources other than fees. "I 
must go to bed at night with the 
image in my mind from a year 
ago when we were told how much 
work a student had to do; how 
much in loans he had to take - I 
think every one of us lives with 
that image every day of our lives." 

Following a $443 million bud-
get loss since 1990, the UC will 
receive its first state funding in-
crease in years. A four-year com-
pact with Gov. Pete Wilson in-
cludes plans forthis year's smaller 
boost and four percent funding 
increases for each of the follow-
ing years. The governor also pro-
posed 10 percent student fee hikes 
for the next four years. 

"The governor's compact rep-
resents a strong commitment to 
renewing the state's investment 
in higher education," said outgo-
ing President Peltason, who has 
served two-and-a-half years try-
ing to maintain quality at the uni-
versity during troubled financial 
times. "It means that after a pe-

Rich Yumul Gullfl1lan 

riod of struggle, uncertainty and 
sacrifice, the University of Cali-
fornia is on the move again," he 
added. 

While most regents accepted 
the governor's budget proposal, 
Student Regent Terrence Wooten 
expressed disappointment in his 
colleagues, who he said have 
settled for a poor budget. "We 
gave a clear message to the stu-
dents that we would do every-
thing we can to have no fee in-
crease, " Wooten said. "The board 
is the caretaker of their educa-
tion, and they have to trust that 
this board will fight for them." 

State Superintendent of Pub-
lic Instruction Delaine Eastin 
agreed with Wooten. "We are 
aski ng students to bear a dispro-
portionate share of the burden," 
she said. "What were the fees 
five years ago? Theratcheting up 
over time is dramatic." 

Student fees, which were 
51,620 in 1990-91, have since 
increased by 125 percent. Under 
the four-year compact, the fees, 
which are 53,800 this year, will 
increase 46 percent by 1998-99, 
to more than 53,300. 

UC Provost Walter Massey 
said that fee increases were nec-
essary to maintain quality and 
access. Peltason defended the stu-
dent increases, saying that "in-
creases will be predictable, so 
students and their families can 
plan for them. " 

UCSD's representative to the 
UC Student Association (UCSA), 
Naomi Falk, who chairs the 
UCSA Fees and Financial Aid 
Committee, said she did not be-
lieve that fee hikes were neces-
sary. "I really hope that students 
recognize that the regents aren't 
being tcpe to them," she said. 
"There is state money, but the 
state's not willing to commit it to 
higher education. I'm really an-
gered that this early in the game 
the regents have already agreed 
to the 10 percent fee increase." 

Regent John Davies said that, 
unless the economy improves, the 
fee increases are likely. "Of 
course we will we will continue 
to fight for additional funding, 
but we can't fight for money that 
isn't there. " 

Massey said that accessibility 
will be maintained by using a 
third of new fee revenue for fi-
nancial aid. According to Massey, 
additional Cal Grants will also be 
made available. However, the 
UCSA released a pamphlet ques-
tioning whether federal funding, 
which provides the majority of 
financial aid, will survive the Re-
publican takeover in Washing-
ton, D.C. 

Professional school fees are 
also targeted UDder the proposed 
budget, with increases of $],000 
per year in medicine, dentistry 
and veterinary medicine, and in-
creases ofS2,OOO in business and 
law until they reach the level of 
comparable public universities. 

The f~ hikes will be used to 
help pay forstaff pay increases of 
1.5 percent and facuIty salary in-
creases of three percent, which 
are less than the regents had 
planned. Faculty salaries, which 
will still be 7.5 percent less than 
average this year, are expected to 
be raised to comparable standards 
in four years. 

"The budget is not what the 
students would like to see, but it 
provides a raise for the faculty, 
and the faculty is the University 
of California," Regent Roy 
Brophy said. 

CONNERLY: 
Students call his 
claims 'fairy tales' 
ContInued from PICe 1. 
that there is a whole generation of 
young black college kids who have 
defeatist attitudes; who believe that 
every rejection in life flows from race; 
who believe that they can't succeed," 
he said. 

Challenging Connerly's claims 
against affirmative action, University 
of California Student Association 
(UCSA) representative York Chang 
said that there are "gross misconcep-
tions and fairy tales of what exactly 
UC admissions policies are." 

He said the policies do not consider 
race and ethnicity alone, and called on 
the board to present empirical evi-
dence of abuses. 

nation, not to be the device for it -
they will always look at Ward Connerly 
as a black regent, as a product of affir-
mative action," he added. 

Regent Leo Kolligian said it is a 
good time to put affirmative action on 
the table before it accomplishes the 
opposite of its intentions. "We have 
free access to our K-12," he said. "Ev-
ery student has an opportunity to go to 
the university on the merit of his own 
achievements, not because of race, 
color or religion." 

Chang disagreed, saying that, "if 
you say affirmative action is no longer 
necessary, you are ignoring the dispar-
ity that still exists between who has the 
resources and who has the opportuni-
ties. " 

Chang added, however, that he was 
pleased to see that Connerly and the 
board wanted to move slowly. "It's a 

University of Cali-
fornia President Jack 
Peltason, who warned 
to be "carefu I not to 
embroil the university 
more than necessary," 
said that his staff is al-
ready preparing a re-
port on affirmative ac-
tion because of the con-
tentious atmosphere 
emerging around the 
issue. The report will 
be presented in the 
spring, he added. 

"Until we've 
recognized that

very complex and 
emotional issue, and 
they are trying to see 
as many sides as pos-
sible," he said . "If 
there are abuses, they 
should be investi· 
gated. " 

Connerly said that 
he appreciates the 
progress America has 
achieved through affir-
mative action in the 
past. "Make no mis-
take, we would not be 
an integrated society 
today if we. had not 
embarked on affirma-

he said.

He said he will 
withhold judgment 
until the board pre-

we should believe that

UCSA representa-

she also felt more com-

"I can't tell you the humiliation as

Falk said. "Talking to 
him, I've come to realize that he is 
interested in finding an alternative that 
will get students into the university -
something that will work even beuer. 

"In terms of our ultimate goal, I 
think we share it: making sure the

Exec Board 
Elections 

It's that time of year again. 
With elections for the IFC and 
Pan hellenic Executive Board of 
Directors right around the comer, 
fraternity and sorority members 
will be given the opportunity to 
join the teams responsible for 
creating and maintaining relations 
among not only Greeks, but the 
entire UCSD community. 
Applications for the executive 
boards are available now at the 
IFC/PanhellenicOfficeon the third 
floor of the Price Center, and are 
due tomorrow, January the 24th. 
Interviews and elections will be 
conducted by the current executive 
board and should be completed by 
February II . The new IFC I 
Panhellenic Executive Board of 
Directors will then begin training 
for the new term starting this 
Spring. 

In order to qualify for a 
position on the executive board, an 
applicant should have a 2.5 
cumulative GP A, and be enrolled 
at UCSD as a full time student. 
"We have a lot of things that we 
want to achieve, so we're looking 
forenthusiastic people with strong 
leadership qualities, H said Jeff 

Woods, the Vice President of 
Administration for IFe. At the same 
time, however, Jeff wanted to stress 
that anyone who wants to become 
involved with the executive boards 
next year should expect to have lots 
of fun. Part of that fun will come 
from helping to organize important 
events such as Greek Week and the 
Red Hot Chili Bash. "When the 
executive board members work 
together cohesively, we get a lot 
done, and in the process, improve 
relations amongst each other, " said 
Michael Genewich, President ofthe 
IFC Executive Board of Directors. 

The other main duty of 
the executive boards is to act as 
mediums between the faculty and 
administration, other student 
organizations, and the studentbody 
in general. In terms of leaming what 
the responsibilities are for 
individual offices on the board such 
as President, or Vice President of 
Development, one will have to go 
to the office to apply. Hurry up 
folks, and pick up your application 
today. Time is running out!

Ah Yeah. It's Winter 
Quarter. Besides the rain 

Fraternity 
Winter Rush 

Winter quarter has 
traditionally been thought of as a 
vacation from the worries 
associated with putting forth a 
formal Rush. A low turnout of 
rushees during last Fall's rush, 
however, fueled 8 of the sixteen 
fraternities into offering an 
informal winter rush during the 
week qf January 16th-22nd. Even 
though year round bidding is not 
uncommon among some of the 
fraternities at UCSD, never before 
have so many participated in 
organized recruitment efforts 
during the winter quarter. 

The relaxed nature of the 
winter rush was intended to attract 
rushees who already had a Specific 
·fraternity in mind. This meant that 
most fraternities barely advertised 
their rush and only needed to offer 
threeevenls. Asa result, there were 
less conflicts among rushees with 
rush scheduling. "We offered 
winter rush to give former rushees 
another opportunity to think about 
it. " said Phi Kappa Theta President 
Brian Mankinen. 

The majority of the 
winter rush events were similar to 
fall and spring events in that they 

offeredfood,drinks,andanactivity 
such as watching football and 
billiards. The difference this time 
around was with location. Most 
events were held away from UCSD .. 
"We felt that off campus activities 
would give us an opportunity to 
better demonstrate what our 
chapter is really like," said Israel of 
Tau Kappa Epsilon. 

Other fraternities enjoyed 
participating in the winter rush for 
other reasons. "We wanted to jump-
start winter quarter and get things 
rolling,· said Jadon Wellman, rush 
chair for Phi Delta Theta. "People 
traditionally view winter as a dead 
quarter, but we wanted to defy that 
notion and show people what our 
fraternity is all about." Those 
fraternities involved in Winter Rush 
were equally enthusiastic about 
expanding the Greek Community 
here at UCSD. We sincerely hope 
that Winter Rush was a fun and 
rewarding experience for all of its 
participants.

sportsmanship is extremely 
important in these games. Guys 
and gals, that means no fights! You 
laugh, but that bloody body could 
~-++Ii be YOUTS. But seriously, it's only a 

game, so prove your worth fairly. 
In the first round we have Alpha 
Chi Omega playing Pi Beta Phi, the 
winner of which who will go on to 

NIt-+-f;,w-4l play Kappa Kappa Gamma. Chi 
Omega will be battling it out with 
Sigma Kappa while Delta Gamma 
will be competing with Alpha 
Omicron Pi. DeltaDeltaDelta takes 
on Kappa Alpha Theta all for the 

1Mo ..... ,WOti possession of the sports banner.So, 
get geared up and ready to go. 
We're in for an exciting quarter. In 
honor of the Olympics, "Let the 
games begin." Good Luck.

In addition to her role in 
student government, the 
Thurgood Marshall College senior 
is the Sponsorship Chair for 
Anchorsplash, Delta Gamma's 
annual philanthropy. The week 
long event usually culminates in a 
swimming competition between 
the fraternities on campus. This 
year, however, Larroque would 
like to see the university come 
together as a whole in aiding the 
blind. She plans to • celebrate the 
other senses" with a band night at 
Porter's Pub which will be open to 
all. The proceeds of the event will 

to the blind," she explainS. 
With her extra-curricular 

activities, her full load of classes, 
and the writing of a senior honors 
thesis entitiled ·Post Cold War 
United States Intervention.· Lisa 
Larroque concedes her lifestyle is 
hectic, but as she adds with 
characteristic cheerfulness, "I still 
have time to watch 'Melrose [Place], 
and to hang out with friends over 
coffee." In her few spare moments 
Larroque aVidly reads. These days, 
though, she is concentrating on 
planning an itinerary for a trip to 
Europe in the summer. 

~isa Larroque is a fourth 
year student who plans to graduate 
in June. She has been a member of 
the Delta Gamma sorority for the 
past three and half years.

11itons Tree Cardinal 
UPSET: UCSD pulls off a three-set miracle, crushing number-two ranked 
Stanford in the biggest match of the UCSB tourney and Triton history 

The Scripps Research Institute (fSRI) 
located near the beautiful La Jolla 
coastline, is the nation's largest private, 

By Jeremy Malameet 
Staff Writer 

For the UCSD men's volleyball 
team, tfie future is now. Mter sev-
eral toll-laking seasons of struggling 

UDLLEY 
alll, 
'".' 
HHLL 

in the cellar of 
the toughest 
conference in 
the nation, the 
Tritons finally 
appear ready 
for the chal-
lenges of big-
time Division I 
volleyball. 

Competing 
against the 
likes of 

Pepperdine, Stanford, USC and 
UCLA, UCSD is the only non-Di· 
vision I school in the conference. 
The Tritons have been pushed 
around for the past couple of years, 
racking up several tough "learning 
experiences. " 

But with a few seasons of les-
sons under their belt, this Triton 
team, led by Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik, took a huge step toward 
respectability with their surprising 
performance at the annual UC Santa 
Barbara Collegiate Invitational. 

Although the UCSB tournament 
is a pre-season event -the matches 
do- not count on a team's record -
the intensity level is high. 

The tournament hosts 24 teams 
that range from Division I schools 
to local club teams, and some of the 

top teams in the nation knock heads 
in the two-day round robin. 

The opening game of the tour-
nament for the Tritons would prove 
to be the most surprising game of 
the weekend. UCSD took on the 
Stanford Cardinal, who came into 
the game ranked second in the na-
tion. Stanford jumped on San Diego 
early, as expected, ,laking game one, 
15-10. 

But the second game belonged 
to the Tritons, as they returned the 
favor and won 15-10, evening the 
match at one game apiece. The fi-
nal game would turn out to be one 
of the most important in Triton vol-
leyball history. 

UCSD held close with the Car-
dinal throughout the contest and fi-
nally prevailed, pulling out a close 
17-15 miracle victory - easily the 
biggest upset of the weekend tour-
ney. It was also the biggest UCSD 
win to date. 

"When we play at around 95 per-
cent of our ability, we are capable 
of playing with the top Division I 
teams. Right now, we're just too 
inconsistent," Dannevik said. 

The Tritons' inconsistency 
showed in their few remaining 
matches. The Stanford upset was a 
tough act to follow, and UCSD 
could not avoid a let-down in its sec-
ond match, a loss to Rutgers Uni-
versity. 

But the team quickly recovered 
and overpowered Cal Poly Pomona 

before dropping a tough match to 
UC Berkeley. The Tritons rounded 
out the weekend with back-to-back 
wins against Westmont College and 
Cal Poly San luiS' Obispo, before 
falling to UC Davis in their final 
match of the tourney. 

The weekend festivities were 
also a coming--out party for senior 
captain Tyson Kerr. Kerr's ex-
tremely strong play gained him the 
respect of opposing players and 
coaches. It also gained him notice 
as a possible all-league-caliber per-
former. 

When it was all over, UCSD gar-
nered four wins in'two days against 
the toughest teams around. But, for 
the Tritons, the stiff competition is 
nothing new in a conference that 
regularly puts three teams in the top 
to. 

Pleased with UCSD's perfor· 
mances in the big games, Dannevik 
still feels the team is far too incon-
sistent, getting up for the big ones 
but lacking focus in the games 
against "lesser opponents." It is a 
problem that only experience will 
remedy. 

For the upstart Tritons - a squad 
with only one senior, three starters 
playing new positions, and two 
starting freshman - the Santa Bar-
bara tourney, and especially the 
Stanford win, proved to be an in-
valuable lesson that will aid the 
young team through the rigors of a 
rough league schedule.

Tritons Mine Gold in First Win HOCKEY: The fun is back ... 
Speaking of rubber and bone 

conglomerates, if you're an inexpe-
rienced hockey fan, this possibility 
is increased 1 O-fold, as you will dis-
cover upon allending your first 
game.

Staff Writer 

The liCSD women's teMis team 
accomplished everything in 1994. 
An illustrious regular season, a 

number of indi-
vidual honors 
and a national 
championship 
accentuated an 
incredible year. 
Topping such a 
performance 
seems nearly 
impossible. 

But if 
UCSD's sea-
son-opening 

win against Division I Long Beach 
State on Saturday is any indication, 
the national champions are back, 
and they're still hungry. The Tritons 
overwhelmed the visitors 8-1. 

Coach Liz laPlante was unsure 
of what to expect from the Triton's , 
first match. Recent rains had lim'-
ited their practices, and there was a 
handful of new faces in the 

lineup. Even so, the Tritons swept 
lAng Beach in singles, notching 
wins at all six slots. 

Sophomore Michelle 
Malephansakul sparkled at her new 
number-one slot, coming from be-
hind to best hard-hilling Farrah 
Tierney s-1, 7-6, 6-2. After barely 
losing the first set, Mal~phansakul 
continued to play hard, eventually 
winning the second in a tie-breaker, 
before beating Tierney in the third. 

Number two Hilary Somers was 
her usual dominating self, turning 
away Kathy Loyd in convin'dng 
fashion, 6-2, 6-1 . Newcomer Suzy 
Drage, a transfer student, recorded 
a fine UCSD debut performance, 
turning away Aida Orejel6-O, 6-1. 

To round out the singles scoring, 
number-four Miki Kurokawa de-
feated Natalie Lelef 6-3, 6-4; num-
ber-five Yumi Takemoto conquered 
Evette Ralph, 6-4, 7-6; and Morgan 
Gessford, in her first match for 
UCSD after spending a year in 
Spain, ran over Deanna Grummer 
6-3,6-2.

The Triton's dominance car-
ried over into doubles, where 
they took two of three. 

The number-one duo of 
Kurokawa-Malephansakul was 
simply too much for Tierney-
Ralph, who succumbed 6-1, 7-
6. Takemoto and Drage were 
even more dominating, bageling 
Orejel-Selby 6-0, 6-0. 

The Tritons only defeat came 
at the number-three doubles slot, 
where Somers-Huberman fell to 
Lelef-Lloyd 6-3, 6-1. laPlante 
was happy with the play of her 
crew but remarked that the 
lineup was not set in stone. 

"We're still playing around 
with the lineup," laPlante said. 
"We're not sure which doubles 
teams will end up being together. 

"We're taking it one match at 
a time," laPlante said. "We have 
one of the toughest schedules 
we've ever had as far as Divi-
sion I schools, and a lot of top 
Division III schools are travel-
ing out to play us." 

ContInued from ..... 20 
Then again, it's the collisions 

that result in the moments of abso-
lute, slow-motion disgust. Moments 
which the networks force us to en-
dure five; or six -hundred times in 
order to bOost viewership ... and na-
tionwide stomach sickness. 

Despite these minor drawbacks 
- or bonuses, depending on how 
demented a person you are -
hockey is a great sport to watch. The 
only thing that rivals the action on 
TV is actually being there to see it 
in person. 

And hockey is the most danger-
ous sport on the planet except, per-
haps, naked. 2OO-pound porcupine 
throwing. (Believe me, seeing a 
stray spine coming your way is one 
of the last things you'd ever want 
to experience.) 

You sec, having a piece of com-
pact rubber merge with your cra-
nium at 100 miles an hour certainly 
ranks up there on the list of bad 
ways to spend an afternoon. 

I earned a new measure of re-
spect for the camera men who bring 
us the action after trying to follow 
that puny, little black dot around the 
ice with my oWJl eyes for the first 
time. 

Believe me folks, it's not easy. 
It's much easier to just stare into the 
flicker and let the boys at ESPN do 
the dirty work. This method signifi-
cantly lowers the possibility of be-
ing served a "puck sandwich" while 
taking your eyes off the game to call 
for the peanut man. 

Simply put, hockey is exciting to 
watch in person if you've got a 
strong stomach and quick reflexes. 
In which case, I would recommend 
turning on your TV, pulling a chair 
up close and pretending you're in 
the middle of the action. 

You avoid the threat of inter-bal-
listic puck missiles, and you've al-
ways got the remote if you can't 
handle it.

miracle victory. 

Down by a much as 18 points in 
the first half of action, UCSD man-
aged to limp into halftime only trail-
ing by 13. The miserable .306 first-
half field-goal shooting was coun-
tered only by several red-hot Triton 
treys (I 2-36, .333 for the game from 
three-point land). 

"We couldn '( get it done from the 
two-point line. We were throwing 
up all kinds of weak shots. The 
three-pointer really kept us in the 
game," Lanthier said. 

UCSD closed the gap even more 
in the second half, thanks again to 
sharp shooting from downtown. In 
particular, veteran Todd Benetar (25 
points) stepped it up, pouring in five 
of nine three-pointers. 

SPORTS 15 

Matt Minehan, Chris 
Christensen and Aune also led a 
consistent Triton attack, chipping in 
12 points apiece. 

Menlo 's enormous cushion of a 
lead - at one glance, a 21-point 
margin - was chopped down to 
only five nearing the game's final 
conclusion. 

That 's when the Oaks, led by 
senior guard Fine Lauese 's pin-
point 10-1 I shooting, finally 
stopped the bleeding. 

Aided also by guard Jason 
Schwerdt (22 points) and forward 
Jeff McGee (14 points), Menlo (9-
7) eventually pulled away from 
UCSD (7-11), closing out the final 
score at 83-76. 

"[Menlo] is a big, experienced 
team," Lanthier said. "Overall, we 
played well. It was a good test for 
us on the road. We should beat this 
team al the end of the season [Feb. 
24]."

Cal Lutheran Reigns in 
SUPPING: Triton women's hoopsters drop their third straight 
game to an undefeated Cal Lutheran squad on Saturday night 
By D_n Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Did you ever know one of those kids in 
school who always did everything just a little 
bit better than you? You know, the annoying

'l~

BHLL 

one you despiled. 
Well, then you know a 

little bit about how the 
UCSD women 's basket· 
ball team (9-5) felt on Sat-
urday night when it went 
up against the undefeated 
Regals from California 
Lutheran University. 

Coming into the con-
test , Cal Lutheran had 
posted a stellar 14-0 record 
on the season and was 

coming off a big victory over Redlands. 
UCSD, on the other hand, came into.the game 
struggling, having dropped its last two games 
to La Verne and Chapman University. 

The Tritons major problem in those defeats 
was poor shooting, and UCSD was assured 
that if it could not improve its recent percent-
ages, it would have little chance of defeating 
the powerful squad from Cal Lu. 

The Tritons played a strong game, leading 
through much of the first half and hanging 
close to Cal Lu throughout most of the sec-
ond. However, no matter how many times 
UCSD surged, the Regals always had an an· 
swer. And, in the end, the Tritons couldn't end 
Cal Lu's winning ways, as the Regals ex· 
tended their winning streak to 15 straight 
games. 

"I'm very pleased with how we played 

tonight," UCSD Head Coach Judy Malone 
said. "We did a lot of good things and we took 
them out of their game. They're just a very 
good team." 

The Regals got off to a fast start and had a 
six-point edge in the early going, 17-11. 
UCSD quickly erased the margin, though, as 
Stacy Patsko canned a short jumper on a pretty 
pass from Michelle Henricks. Janessa Bayda 
was as good as gold on a deep three-pointer 
the next trip down the floor, and Cal Lutheran 
called a timeout with the score knotted at 17 
apiece. 

"We came out fired up tonight," Malone 
said. "We were ready to play. The girls were 
really hustling." 

Following the break in the action, the two 
squads traded baskets for a few minutes until 
the Tritons were able to put on a small run 
near the end of the first half. 

A number of big shots propelled UCSD to 
a five-point halftime cushion. Marcia Jeffries 
started the fireworks when she pulled up and 
nailed a right-side jumper. On the Tritons very 
next posession, Jeffries once again found an 
open space on the floor, and a teammate hit 
her for a deep three pointer, putting the score 
at 27-23. 

Cindy Yamasaki was the next player to step 
up for UCSD, raining in an arcing three-point 
bomb and swishing home two free throws to 
put the Tritons up by five. 

. Their efforts were capped of by a great play 
from Amy Franzen. Franzen was applying the 
pressure defense when Regal guard Nicole 
Albert attempted an ill-advised pass over her. 
Franzen leapt into the air to knock down the 

Monday, January 23, 1995 

pass and then took it 
the other way for a lay-
up. Her play was the 
last of the half, and 
UCSD jogged into the 
locker room with a 37-
32 advantage on the 
previously unbeaten 
Regals.

However, its lead 
was short lived as Cal 
Lutheran stormed out 
of the gate in the sec-
ond half and took the 
lead on UCSD with 
16:35 to play. The 
Regals' leading scorer, 
Melissa Wood (28 
points, six rebounds) 
swooped in for a lay-up 

on the fast break that made the score 45-44, 
Cal Lu. The Tritons quickly called for a 
timeout to try and stop the bleeding. 

The Regals continued to extend the mar-
gin, however, pressing the difference as high 
as seven points, at 55-48, when Wood drove 
to the hole once again and hit a short j'umper 
in the lane amongst defenders. UCSD fought 
back on another long bomb from Jeffries and 
a pretty move inside by Anne Westmoreland, 
who converted to pull the Tritons within one, 
59-58. 

Cal Lutheran called a pair of timeouts 
down the stretch to slow UCSD's momentum 
and it worked as the Triton charge stalled at 
71-67. The Regals went on to tally six of the 

final seven points, and won the contest going 
away, 77-68. 

"Everyday we're working hard," Malone 
said. "We are still a very young team and we 
are getting better every night." 

UCSD's improved offensive effort was 
paced by Yamasaki, but she had a balanced 
supporting cast. Stacy Patsko 's hustle and 
strong board work was one of the keys to the 
Tritons improved performance. Patsko con· 
tributed 12 points and pulled down 11 re-
bounds, including six on the offensive end of 
the ball. 

Jeffries was the third Triton to hit double 
digits in the game with 10 points on four of 
seven shooting from the field. 

UCSD Stymied By Division I Toreros in Op~ning Match 
TOREROED: The Tritons couldn't knock off cross-town rival University of San Diego in their opening contest of season; the 
Toreros dealt the UCSD men's tennis team a painful, but somewhat expected, 7-0 defeat on Sunday afternoon. 

By HI"" Somers 
Staff Writer 

It might not have been exactly what the 
youthful visitors wanted, but after the Uni-
versity of San Diego Toreros had finished 

severely squashing the 
UCSD men's tennis team 
at home on Sunday, 7-0, 
the Tritons realized they 
got a much-needed tennis 
lesson. 

It was a tough season 
opener for UCSD for sev· 
eral reasons. One of these 
is that now the young Tri· 
tons have to look forward 
to their next match to get 
over that "first win" 

hurdle - and build up the team's overa II con-
fidence level. 

But yet another reason was predetermined 
before the season began: The Tritons have 
only two of their top six players returning 
from last year's group. 

Moving up from last season's number-five 
position to the number· three spot, Dan 
Brounstein is slowly gaining respect in the 
collegiate tennis world. 

Sunday was Brounstein's first big step to-
ward the limelight. He played an aggressive 
first set, losing it in heartbreaking fashion in 
a tie-breaker, 8-6. He then went on to lose the 
second set and the match, 7-6, 6-3. 

In the feature match of the day, senior Rob-
ert Ho definitely had his work cut out for him. 
Playing in the number-one singles position, 
he came out of the gates strong, knotting the 
opening set at 2-2 apiece. 

But he was unable to keep up with his 
tough Division I opponent, eventually drop-
ping the first set by a 6-2 margin. Ho lost his 
momentum and the second set, 6-1. 

Playing number two for the Tritons is an-
other new face. Frank Heeb is an overseas 
transfer from Lichtenstein who is known for 
his aggressive play. Unfortunately, his tough-
ness wasn't enough to win the match, and he 
was handily outgunned, 6-2, 6-2. 

"It was great to feel so mentally into [the 
game1forthe first match of the season," Heeb 
said. 

Aside from Heeb, three other new memo 
bers have been added to the UCSD men's trav· 
elling squad. One of these, Mike Wilson, 
gained valuable experience at the number-four 
spot yesterday. His opponent, however, was 
the one dishing it but, nearly running Wilson 
off the court with a commanding display of 
tennis mastery, 6-0, 6-2. 

Emil Miliet, another newcomer, discov-
ered how rough Division I opponents can be, 
and how these fierce foes seem to win the 
clutch points when they need to. 

"I had nine break points and couldn't con-
vert one," Mmet said. 

Ping Yeh, a freshman at the number-six 
slot, also learned the difference between Di-
vision I and Division III talent firsthand . 
Fresh out of high school, Yeh quickly discov-
ered that college tennis - especially at a 
school with UCSD'. competitive schedule-
is a totally different ballgame. 

"That's the worst I've ever been beat," Yeh 
said, after being bageled in two straight sets, 
6-0,6-0. 

The story was the same on the doubles side 
of the court for UCSD. The Torero hit parade 
continued with flair, as the number-one duo 
of Ho and Brounstein were viciously 
pummelled, 8-0, in a - change from the nor-
mal two-of-three sets format - pro set. 

Heeb and Wilson, the Tritons' number-two 
doubles team, were in over their heads, slip- . 
ping rapidly, 8-2. The third UCSD pair of Ari 
Marken and Matin Davari held their own, 
before USD pulled away, 8-4. 

The weekend tangle with the Toreros was 
a humbling warm-up match for the Tritons, 
but its lesson did not elude UCSD. With a 
Division I opponent past them, the Tritons are 
prepared for their upcoming season of Divi-
sion III foes. 

The stiff competition toughened them up, 
so that they're physically and mentally ready 
for any Division III team that dares to enter 
their courts.

Hockey 
Insomnia! 

Never did I think that it 
would be so gratifying to view 
the pummeling, pounding and 
high-sticking perpetrations of 
professional ice hockey 
players. That is, not until they 
took the sport away from us. 
Now it is back and, as they 
say, it's better than ever. 

My inexplicable desire to 
watch this, the most brutal of 
sports, may have something to 
do with that old adage - "you 
don't really appreciate 
something until it's gone." Or 
maybe I just haven't seen 
enough good, old-fashioned 
fist-fighting in the last few 
months. 

Whatever the case may be, 
I found myself glued to the 
television set at 2 a.m., 
watching the replay of a 
hockey game on ESPN. At this 
point, two questions quickly 
jump to mind: why would 
anyone watch a game in which 
the outcome is already known 
and every normal person is 
already asleep, and why would 
ESPN show the game again if 
the first question is true? 

Apparently, my logic is 
flawed in at least one of these 
questions, but I have to admit I 
~ ... as enthralled. Just don't ask 

me to explain why I was 
watching it, because f was 
supposed to have been 
studying. When f finally ran 
out of ways to procrastinate, I 
flipped by the Rangers and the, 
um, well, I don 't even know 
who they were playing. That's 
how enthralled I was. 

But I sat there with my 
copy of Catch-22 on the desk 
in front of me and my eyes 
firmly focused on that 
flickering square of light one 

I root away, which was probably 
sending me well on my way to 
early blindness or, at the very 
least, an extremely thick set of 
spectacles. 

I realized then that hockey 
is simply a great sport. The 
intense, hard-hitting action, 
and the fact that it's 10 times 

~rder than any other sport to 
stop the clock - I mean, you 
have to hit the puck over the 
glass - makes it a great 
viewing pleasure. 

Of course, this is assuming 
you're not the type of person 
who minds seeing large men 
sliding across ice on two-inch 
blades of steel and slamming 
into one another at high 
speeds, often exchanging 
punches along the way.

Curtiss Crashes NCAAs 
DIVE·HO: Swimmers 
battle Ind. Hills; divers 
tangle with UCSB 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Last weekend represented an-
other chance for UCSD's swimming 
and diving squads to qualify for 

NCAAs and im-
prove their times. 

For senior 
diver Josh Curtiss, 
Saturday 's meet at 
UCSB repre-
sented his biggest 
moment of the 
year. Curtiss as-
sembled a solid 
performance in 
the three-meter 
springboard 

event, finishing fourth with a score 
of 287.20, and qualifying for the 
NCAA tournament in the process. 

"We had a really great day," 
Head Coach Mike Fitchett said. 
"The weather cooperated, it didn't 
rain on us, and we dove really well. 
[Curtiss] qualifying was the high-
light of the day." 

Junior Adam Burgasser, who has 
already qualified for the "big dance" 
of Division III diving, continued to 
impress snatching a second place 
finish with a top-notch score of his 
own, 306.15, in the three-meter 
board. 

Burgasser dove to a third-place 
standing in the one-meter event with 
a solid tally of 277.20 while Curtiss 
grabbed fifth (258.15). 

The women were only diving 
against UCSB, but were equally 
successful. Sheri Takeuchi led the 
Triton charge on the one-meter 
board coming in second only to the 
Gauchos number-one diver with a 
score of 282.45. The rest of the Tri-
ton crew swept third and fourth with 
sophomore Kristi Young and UCSB 
transfer student Brigitte Elfman do-
ing the honors. Young scored 266.90 
while Elfman contributed a solid set 
of dives worth 244.2 points. 

"Having three divers in the top-
four was great," Fitchett said. 

Takeuchi narrowly missed upset-
ting UCSB s number-one diver in 
the three-meter event grabbing sec-
ond with a score of 274.55, less than 
two points off 
the pace. 

her eight-and-a-halves from the 
judges. 

Meanwhile, back in balmy San 
Diego, the swimming team contin-
ued its quest to improve times by 
taking on a group from the Industry 
Hills Swimming Club. 

Both squads went down in de-
feat, but despite the losses, UCSD 
did not come away from the meet 
without it 's share of solid swims. 

Shawna Caballero turned in a 
quick time of 25.32 in the 50-yard 
freestyle which earned second-place 
while teammates Renee Salgado 
and Heather McPherson swam 
strong in other freestyle events. 

Salgado posted an 11 : 12.28 in 
the lOOO free for third-place and 

swam home in 
5.27.10 in the 
500-yard event. 
McPherson also 
caught her 
coaches eye in 
the 500 freestyle 
with a time of 
5:24.26 and led 
off a relay with a 
100-yard 
freestyle time of 
56.88.

Tritons 
Split Set 
Up North 
EVEN KEEL: UCSD 
topples Dominican; 
falls to Menio in 
two-game road trip 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

Tallying a I-I record on a dif-
ficult road trip is nothing to scoff 
at. Especially if you're as young 

as the UCSD 

BR~KET 

~" "",~' 
BHLL 

men's basket-
ball team. 

The Tri-
ton hoopsters 
flew north-
ward last 
weekend 
with six wins, 
10 losses and 
a roster with-
out any "Sr." 
designations. 

They returned after splitting 
the bill- a blowout victory over 
Dominican College and a tight 
loss against Menlo College -
with valuable lessons about com-
peting away from home. 

"It was a good experience for 
us," UCSD Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier said. "We haven ' t been 
playing well on the road. To fly 
up there and do what we did was 
great." 

UCSD tangled with 
Domincan during Friday night 's 
matchup, and the opportunistic 
Tritons took control of the con-
test early. 

Even th ough UCSD was 
without two key players - due 
to injury and disciplinary prob-
lems - San Diego 's fast-break 
offense easily manhandled a 
weak Domincan squad. 

"We really opened it up in the 
first half," Lanthier said. "It 
wasn 't a very well-played game 
on our part ... but we did shoot 
well from the line." 

Twenty-seven turnovers and 
a few dry stretches of absent 
scoring plagued the Tritons, but 
they were still able to hold off 
their opponents' best efforts. 
Paced by center Matt Aune's 16 
points and guard Jason Barnes' 
18-point barrage, UCSD rolled 
over Dominican, 90-75. 

During the Menlo game on 
Saturday, the Tritons played sig-
nificantly cleaner, error-free bas-
ketball . But they just couldn't 
pull out a come-from-behind
