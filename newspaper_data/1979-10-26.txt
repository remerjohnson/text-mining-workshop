San Diego is Confident It

While two Del Mar groups are piecing 
together strategies for' court action against 
North City West. attornevs for the development 
and the City of San Diego are Quietly waiting to 
overcome the challenge to their ten-year-old 
effort. 

"We think we have done what is required bv 
state' and federal law," says San Diego City 
Attorney John Witt. "We have looked over and

South African 
Nuclear Device 
Detected by US 

W ASI:IINGTON (AP) - us intelligence 
has evidence indicating that South Africa may 
have exploded a nuclear device in the 
atmosphere on Sept. 22, government officials 
said last night. 

Intelligence officials said the indicators, 
picked up by a US reconailSance satelUte, were 
not conclusive enough to make a firm judgment 
and it was possible the satellite detected a 
natural phenomenon. 

However, the officials, who asked not to be 
named, said the weight of opinion is that it was, 
an explosion in the atmosphere: 

US officials are checking otber sources of 
information, including various detection 
devices, and have contacted US allies in 
Western Europe to determine what their 
intelligence may have learned. 

The State Deparbnent said in a statement 
that it was continuing to·alle .. evidence that a 
"low-yield nuclear explosion occurred on Sept. 
22 in an area of the Indian Ocean and South 
Atlantic, incluCting portions of the Antarctic 
Continent and the southern part of Africa." 

Last year, the intelligence sources said the 
United States and the Soviet Union both 
independently detected through satellite 
photography. that the South Africans may 
have built a nuclear test structure in the Kalihari 
Desert. The Russ .. ns contacted the United 
States at that time. 

A twclear explosion would most Ukely have 
involved a teat device rather than a finished 
weapon, the sources said. 

However, even' an experimental nuclear test 
would raiae the Ukelihood that Sou:it Africa 
was moving toward a nuclear weapons force. 

A spokesman for the South African 
government was quoted as saying that the 
report was "mere speculation. South Africa has 
insisted for some time that it hal no interest in , 
building a nudear dc!vice." 

The nuclear weapons club currently includes 
the United States, the Soviet Union, Mainland 
China, France, Britain and India, which 
exploded it. 6rst nuclear device about five years 
ago. 

There is a strong belief in the intelligence 
community that Israel has produced nuclear 
weapons, but there is no public evidence of that 
fact. 

Recently, the United States has been 
attempting to discourage Pakistan from 
deveJopilll nuclear weapons. 

The City of Del Mar, which formally 
announced Tuesday it will take court action, 
and the Coalition for Responsible Planning, 
which Co-Chairman Tom Shepherd says will 
"most definitely'" follow suit, can attempt 
litigation on either a federal or state level. 

While neither group will discuss their plans, 
several local attorneys agree that a federal 
court would insist that the cii'se be handled on a 
state level. 

Witt believes the City of San Diego "is on 
very firm ground" in federal court anyway, and 
doubts the project will be challenged there. The 
city is also "strong" on a state level, he adds. 

"y.5l ... 
Louis Goble, attorney for the Baldwin 

Company, one of two primary North City West 
developers, agrees with Witt. 

"There's been a fair opportunity to make a 
fair decision. The (San Diego) Council had to , 
balance the interests of all the citizens in the San 
Diego area. We think they did that," Gall 
argues. 

A memorial meeting honoring Dr. Herbert Marcuae will be held 
tonight at 8 pm in USB 2722. 

But Shepard says it is "absolutely" possible 
to stop North City West "in its presen~ form ... '

Revelle Soapbox Area · 
Draws. Student Speakers 

By Sam Gooch 
Staff Writer , 

The first gathering at "Speaker'sCor-
ner," a new pub ic speaking forum held 
yesterday on Revelle Commons, 
featured student speakers on a potpourri 
of topic including body language, 
revolutions, and gas station rip·offs. 

The soapbox is open to anyone 
speaking. on anything from 11 :30 to 1 
every Thursday, a~ccording to Ed 
Lazarus, chairman of the Revelle 
College Noon Programming 
Committee. II All you have to do is jump 
up on a box and start talking," he says. 

Lazarus says there are four rules tc 
which speakers must adhere: 

(1 ) No profanity; 
(2) No amplifiers or noise making 

de,vices; 
(3) Questions may be asked and 

·debates may take 'place between two or 
more speakers as long as anyone 
speaker is not obstructed; 

(4) All persons are welcome to peak 
including students, faculty, 
administrators and anyone from outside 
the campus community. 

Lazarus explained that committee 
members will be on hand to supervise the 
peaking events. but "will only intervene 

if situations get out of hand. We won't 
allow any malicious interference," he 
says. 

Initially, the committee was 
concerned about how the administration 
would react to the proposal for Speaker's 
Comer," says Lazarus, "but it turned 
out that we received a very positive 
response from the Revelle College 
Dean's office, " 

Lazarus believes that "the 
administration knows they have far less 
of a chance of getting into trouble by 
allowing the open forum than if they 
didn't.. .Speaker's Comer will offer an 
outlet for people with complaints about 
the administration and the university in 
general." . 

"(It) will solve a big problem we had 
with groups like the Hare Krishna who 
would come during the noon hour and 
disturb others with their music. Now, 
anyone can deliver their mea .. ge 
without interfering with other speakers 
or. offending audiences with loud 
noises," Lazarus says. 

Lazarus says the, .committee 
borrowed the name "Speaker's Comer" 
(rom the public peaking area in Hyd 
Park, London. 

,Unpredicted 
Force Part of 
Val'y Quake 

Jly Peter Mortensen 
California may not have 

collapsed into the ocean 
following the Oct. 15 Imperial 
Valley earthquake, but 
scientists here are still 
concerned with data from the 
temblor that shows the release 
ot large Quantities of energy in 
isolated locations along the 
fault line. 

"You would literally have 
been thrown in the air if you 
had been standing there," says 
earth scientist Richard Simons 
of these faults. Simons, 
working at Scripps' Institute of 
Geophysics and Planetary 
Physics, says that a unique 
acceleration readings, which 
would effect the e'arth's 
gravitational forces, were 
noted during the Imperial 
Valley Quake by several US 
Geological Survey strong 
motion recorders. 

"This strong reading is well 
in excess of what a lot of 
people thought was possible," 
said Simons, adding that 
"based on the theories that a 
lot of people held - especially 
those advising in the 
construction industry - this is 
far in excelS of the maximum 
acceleration they would 
expect to see." 

A top reading of 1. 75g 
(used to denote gravitational 
forces relative to the earth) 
was taken at one station 
toward the north end of the 
fault, prompting- Simons and 
his colleagues to begin further 
investigations into what he 
terms "phenomenal acceler-
ation for an earthquake only 
measuring six plus on the 
Richter scale." 

"From the standpoint of 
accelerations," stated Simons,

Fetus Has Rights 
Editor: 

After reading the article on 
"Abortion Rights Action 
Week" in the Oct. 22 i .. ue, I 
find my.elf quite frankly 
appalled that the .upposedly 
retpon.ible Auociate 
Student. would aponaor auch a 
demoralization of the hwnan 
spirit. 

Let'. cut thrQUlh aU of the 
semantic. and say what 
abortion it. It i. "the right to 
choose" to tenninate, ' to end 

baby is born. It is either 
removed surgically (a 
Caesarean section), maimed 
and removed through the birth 
canal, or killed and caused to 
be deliveresl by miscarriage. 

The.e people apeak of the 
woman's right to choose. 
What happens to the child's 
inalienable right to live? The 
right 10 choose abortion is 
clearly the right to murder.

Spain Abortion Trial Byrd Favors SAL T More 'War~ Arrests 

MADRID, Spain - Police drove buses into a 
marching column of 600 feminists yesterday who 
were protesting the scheduled trial of 11 women 
charged with having or performing abortions. ' 

As the marchers in downtown Madrid fled from in 
front of the buses other police pursued them, 
swinging clubs and tossing smoke grenades. 

Several demonstrators were jnjured as they were 
dispersed in the second such protest in Madrid in the 
past week. ~ 

The abortion trial is set to open today in the 
northern Basque city of Bilbao, and feminist. in the 
Basque region have called for nationwide protests to 
demand amnesty for the defendants. 

Women's demonstrations also were reported 
yesterday in Valencia, the Canary Islands, the resort 
island of Majorca and the university city of Santiago 
de Compo.tela, where police chased 100 women 
from a city' hall sit·in. . 

The conservative Madrid newspaper ABC 
dem~nced what it called the feminists' "campaign 
for abortion" in thi. predominantly Roman Catholic 
nation where abortion is forbidden.

authoritarian governnient. Informed lOurces said 
800 policemen were rushed to the campus when the

resolution calling on the government to carry out 
democratic reforms. . 

The demonatr ation'lasted about two hours. School

to prevent further disturbances. 

WASHINGTON - Calling on the Senate to 
"help make the world a more secure and safer place," 
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D·W. Va., 
yesterday endorsed the S~L T II treaty. 

At a new. conference, Byrd said: "I have 
concluded that SALT II is in our national interests. I 
believe that the treaty should be approved by the 
Senate, with the adoption of certain provisions to the 
resolution of ratification. ': 

The majority leader, whose support is crucial to 
approval of the strategic arms limitation pact with the 
Soviet Union, proposed that the Senate add to the 
resolution of ratification language that would: 

-Specify that the protocol could oot be extended 
beyond its Dec. 31, 1981, expiration date without 
specific approval of the Senate. 

-Specify that the treaty in no way affects existing 
cooperation on force modernization, 

-Make legally binding the .lIurances given 
President Carter by Soviet ·President Leonid 
Brezhnev that production of the Soviet Backfire 
bomber would be held to the current rate of 30 a year.

~nough Players Is Too Many 

,Field Hockey Just Can't Win 
,- By Jon Goetz 

Sport!> Editor 
The field hockey team is 

caught in a dilemma. They lost 
their first two games 10 
Grossmon! imd Long Beach 
State because they were 
playing with less than the 
standard amount of players 
needed. 

On Wednesday's game 
against Cal State Fullerton ttie 
Tritons were finally able to 
field II women for the game 
- and they still lost. The 
problem: overcrowding. "We 
started running into each 
other," said Jerry Mucha, 
coach of the team that lost its 

third straight game, 3-0. 
" If we had a full team all the 

time, we wouldn'I ' have had 
that problem," said Mucha. 
"We had a problem with 
readjustment. " 

Defensive ace Sheila 
O'Brien hustled on the Tritons' 
half of me field ! but the 
majority of the defensive play 
was sluggish. "It didn't seem 
like anyone was running for 
lhe shots," Mucha said. Goalie 
Robin Geiston-Wall, had to 
play more intensely because of 
this, but she played well to let 
in only three goals. 

Tritons kept the ball in 
Fullerton territory throughout 

much of the game, but couldn't 
get the ball into the net. The 
Tritons just "didn't realize who 
was there" 10 pass to, Mucha 
said. 

The offen.e .uffered 
becau.e of the problems 
getting a whole team together 
in practice_ Pr ~clice rarely 
attracts the entire rosier of 14 
players, and this restricls the 
players from working on 
anything more advanced than 
basic .kill.. With just , four 
games remaining ' on their 
schedule, the women need 
more work at their team play 
to avoid a winless season. 

Time to Court Racquetball Wins 
The racquetball team starts 

its firsl .eason of, play 
Saturday at 2 pm , when San 
Diego State viii" the UCSD 
home courtl. -

UCSD player Jim Ander-
son: who placed third in the 
All-Cal la.t apring, leadl the 
learn again.t SDSU at the 
YMCA courts near La Jolla 
Scenic Drive North (across 
from campus). The lasl time 
the two ' teams mel San Diego 
State won, six matches to four. 

Tomorrow's match will 
probably end up similarly, 
according to Anderson. The 
Trilons have one "B" player, 
Anderson, and the remainder 
of their rosler- for Saturday's 
matches, Marlin Brenner, 
Richard Goldman, Jerry 

Rodriguez, J.on Kawamoto, 
Tracy Lane, Janet Moo, and 
Toni Regers, are "e" players 

. or novices. ("A" player. are 
the highett ranked). SDSU will 
probably o!Jlplay the Tritons, 
since they have some "A" 
players 'on their roster for the 
match. 

A loss tomorrow might stir 
up the UCSD players, says 
Anderson . "Aller . Ihis 
Salurday, if we get beat, they'D 
get some incentive. 'They'll 
start practic1ng more," he said. 

The UCSD team wal also 
face USD and Palomar 
College twice, and San Diego 
State one more time, The four 
schools formed a league t~s 
fall, and all play each other 
two limes between now and 

Thanksgiving. Each malch 
will consist of twelve separate 
singles and doubles games. 

UCSD figures to place 
second' or third in the final 
atandinl{s, above Palomar, 
below SDSU, and c101e to 
USD. The Triton. have a 
goqd chance at topping USD 
because the opposing learn 
captain "has been giving away 
their secrets" to Anderson, 
and Anderson has kept his 
mouth shut. 

UCSD also has the 
advantage on mental attitude. 
"F-rom what I see," says 
Anderson, "our guys have the 
most motivation. Our guys 
function more as a learn.

Rumiing in Front For UCSD 
Doesn't Necessarily Mean Win 

. Low Pressure New Experience to One of Top Two 
By Barbara Ha .. 

Staff Writer 
No mystery exists at the 

finish line of women's cross 
country meets. The front 
runner for the Tritons is 
always Patty Farrell. Or Kelly 
Geredes. Actually, it depends 
on the meet you're referring to. 
Farrell beat out Geredea in the 
first meet of the sealOn, but 
Geredes topped Farrell in the 
last two meets. 

Yet being the top two 
finishers from UCSD doesn't 
guarantee the runners laurel.

Invitational, but she was in

Geredes back in 'their dust.

Being on a team that 's 
exp.ected to lose can 
IOmetimes be a blessin~, 
·however. Farrell said that the 
informal nature that coach 
Andy Skief brings to the team 
allows the athletes "to do your 
best." She added that her high 
school team also has a losing 
record, "10 it's not much of a 
change for me."

Struck 

OAKLAND (AP) - Ira Matthews 
raced 104 yeards with a kickoff and 
Booker Russell scored three times on short 
runs as the Oakland Raider. routed San 
Diego 45·22 Thursday night despite Dan 
Fouts' record fourth consecutive 300· 
yeard passing game for the Char-gers. 

Oakland, which jumped to a 21·0 lead in 
the nationally televi~ National Football 
League game, apPeared to be in trouble 
when the Chargers sliced the margin to 21-
15 midway through the third quarter. 

But Matthews, a rookie from Wisconsin, 
grabbed Mike Wood's kickoff 4 yards in 
the end zone, raced up the right sideline to 
about the Raider 40, then cut back against 
the grain and outran the Charger defenders 
to the left comer of the end zone. It was the 
longest kickoff retum in Oakland history. 

to winning ... In high school our 
coach's attitude was 'you golta 
win, you gotta win,' and here 
it's not like that. There's no 
pressure to win so Y:: '1're free 
to go out and do your best. " 

Farrell, from Sylmar, and 
Geredes, of Los Altos, share 
similar athletic backgrounds. 
Both ran track for two years in 
high 'school and competed in 
cross country for one year. 
Farrell was the league 
champion in the mile and two 
mile, and Geredes was the fifth 
person on her high school 
division winning team. . 

The little spare time they 
have is generally used for 
athletics. Gered'es enjoys 
soccer but Farrell prefers 
cycling in her free time. 

Both agreed that some sort 
of "inner strength" makes 
them persist in a race when . 
they feel like quitting. 
"Sometimes I tell myself 'it's 
jUlt a little bit further ', or 'just 
stay with this certain girl'. 
Sometimes I ask myself 'why 
am I doing this? Why aren't I 
home sleeping?''', said 
Geredes. Farrell added that 
"you know you're not going to 
stop anyway, un'less you're 
injured or something, so you 
may as well keep going and 
get it over with." 

Tomorrow the women get 
their fitst chance this season to 
compete on a familiar course

'A Woman's Place Is On Top' 

Mountaineer Tells Quest 
The leader of a mountaine· 

ering expedition that set out to 
prove that "a woman's place is 
on top" will narrate a slide 
show 011 the trip Monday 
night. 

Arlene Blum, normally a . 
biochemical researcher at UC 
Berkely, left the labs behind in 
the summer of 1978, and led a 
group of 13 women to the 
slope of Annapurna, .in Nepal 
the world 's tenth highest 
mountain. Two made the 
ascent of the 26,504 foot

peak, and two fell to their 
death on the icy slopes. 

10,000 slides were taken of 
the climb, which lasted nearly 
two months. Blum shows the 
best of those slides, retracing 
the group's steps through the 
storms, avalanches, and 
spectacular moonscape 
scenery that they encountered . 

Blum led the first all ·woman 
climb of Annapurna , and set 
an altitude record for 
American women in the 
process. Over 250 Nepalese 
assisted the expedition, and 
two climbed the summit with 
the women. Yet in her lecture 
she notes that the male 
Sherpas were -the. only 
climbers on the trip to suffer 
from altitude sickness. 

Blum wrote an account of 
the trip .in the March , 1979 
issue of National Geographic. 
The National Geographic 

Society picked up part of the 
$80,000 tab for the climb, and 
the group raised the rest of the 
money by selling T·shirts 
reading "A woman's place is 
on top/ Annapurna". 

After selling about 1 0,000 
shirts, the team of women 
traveled to the Himalayas in 
August to begin their trip. The 
group included climbers from 
20 to 49 years old , with 
various dew-ees of c1imbinll; 
experience. Blum herself has 
participated in 14 major 
expeditions, including the first 
all-woman climb of Mt. 
McKinley and the American 
Bicentennial climb ' of Mt. 
Everest in 1976. She climbed 
as high as 24,500 feet on the 
slopes of Everest, and returned 
with the idea that more women 
should have the chance to 
c hallenge the difficult 
mountains of the world.

Distribution Plan Set for 
Vending -Machine Funds 
Using College Enrollment 

By Devin Seifer 
A new proposal for distributing this 

year'. $25.000 in vending machine 
revenues was approved unanimously 
Wednesday by a committee of .tudent 
and adminiatration repretentative •. 

According to Revelle Dean Unie 
Mort. the member. of the committee 
were pleased with the decilion which will 
di.tribute the monies "equitably" among 
the lour colle .. and graduate school •. 

Although the Graduate Student 
Council hal vet 10 app~ve the new 
proposal. Mort feel. confident that their 
approval wiD corne lOOn. ' 

LUt year. one·half of vending 
machine revenue. (except from 
machines in the Student Center) were 
channeled by the admini.tration to 
relieve the deb.. built up by campus 
snack ban. The colleges were afraid 
that they would Ioee one of their main 
.ource. 01 income for .tudent 
proJamming and college projecti. 

The $25,000 allocation does not 

include additional money the 
administration will provide to oHIet 
debt. the colleges accumulated during 
the .ummer. Because of that. Mort 
estimates that the colleges will actually 
be in better financial shape this year than 

. they have been in the palt. -
Mort's unofficial computations 

indicate that Revelle College will receive 
from $4.500 to $5,000 in vending 
revenues; Muir, from $5.000 to 
$5.500; Third, from $4.000 to $4,500; 
and Warren. from $4.500 to $5.000. 

EnroUment determines each college'. 
share of vendilUl revenue • . 

UCSD Budget Admini.trator Bob 
Oates says that the collel(e. · and 
graduate schools will receive $30.000 
next year, plus one·half of the difference 
between the predicted total vending 

. machine revenue. (the amount earned in 
the previous year) and the actual monies 
obtained. Thi. could, Mort says. give 
the college. a very large increase in 
revenue.

Despite the spreading aftt;r.hqck, 
Simons does not feel yet that there 
should be any alarm for a greater quake 
on the San Andreas occuring 81 a result 
of the Imperial temblor. . 

"It'. just too early to tell," he said. 
indicating that vast amoun.. of data 
have yet to be analyzed before any 
conclusion. can be drawn.

like to pinpoint the epicenter of the , 
quake. "AU of the .tation. used by the 
USGS to give the initial epicenter 
location are north 01 the border and we 
had. a lot of station. reporting south of 
the border," he explain •. "And their 
epicenter keeps coming oUt south of the 
border somewhere. This i. very 
disquieting because there are no viable 
sign. of any rupture south of the border

any afterahock activity south of the

'Winds of Change' 

By Rick Greene 
Winds 01 Change is the current feature in what seems like a 

series of recent animated epics. But while The Hobbit and The ' 
Lord 01 The Rings were based on T olkien stories. Wind. 01 
Change enacts the mythological tales of Ovid. His name may 
not be fammar but his stories are . 

Wind. 01 Cltafllle i. currently playing at the Lorna Theater 

Five tales have been adapted from Ovid's fifteen books of 
poems, among them the story of Medusa the Corgon and the 
adventure of Apollo the Sun God. Eachaegment features the 
tame hero, a nauseatingly cutesy-type called Wonderlnaker. in 
the various roles. But Winds 01 Change succeed. on only one 
level and fails on all others.

TV Plays Cops and Robbers 
By Beth Accomando 
Senior Staff W riter 

A few years ago pressure 
groups were condemning 
television for its excessive 
violence. In response to this 
criticism, the networks made 
minor concessions and 
gradually toned down the 
violence . Now, however, 
pressure groups · are focusing 
their efforts on removing 
obscenities and offensive 
sexual implications from TV, 
o the networks feel safe 

bringing in a number of 
potentially violent police/de· 

tective dramas for this fall. 
Four of these dramas are 
Eischied, Paris, Hart to Hart, 
and A Man Called Sloane. 

Rising above the stereotypi. 
cal police show is NBC's 
Eischied with Joe Don Baker 
in the titl~ role . Produced by 
the creators of Police Story, 
Eischied . creates strong 
characters who make the show 
interesting and effective. The 
first two episodes dealt with a 
Son.of·Sam.,.tyle killer, and 
what initially looked like 
cashing in on topicality turned 
out to he an interesting drama 

that avoided sensationalism. 
The program kept most of the 
violence off screen, and it did 
not have the cops shooting at 
everything in sight or 
continually engaging in high 
speed chases. The show also 
has a strong realistic edge. 
When the killer is arrested, the 
show does not pretend that 
everything is now fine and that 
the good guys have made the 
city safe to walk in. Instead, it 
brings up the issue of what 
happens after the arrest - the 
f ac t that the killer m·ight get off

Disco by Elton John is Boring 
By Stan Honda 

In the early 1970's Elton 
John captured the pop/rock 
world as few ever had. He and 
lyri c ist Bernie Taupin 
produced a blend of music that 
was both accessible and 
technically good . Up to 
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road 
he was considered among the 
best musical composers of the 
time . With his recent relea,se of 
Victim of Love, he joins the 
hordes of performers who 
have jumped on the disco 
bandwagon .

Marquez' 114th Dream 
-

Fifth and University 
Marquez was hitch.hiking and he was drunk. The 

traffic was nowhere at Fifth and University. It was 
eight o'clock and he'd missed the cars that feed into 
the freeway daily at six. An old woman in an army 
jacket and a frayed paperbag from Saks in one hand 
walked up to the bus stop where he was sticking out 
his thumb and made noise as she sucked in her 
cheeks. Marquez turned around and saw her spilling 
something brown into the street. 

"Why don't you just gross me out" he said, 
twisting around. A green and white Volkswagon with 
the Camel man painted on the front hood sputtered 
by. The car was full of women. The driver honked her 
horn. He watched the VW sink out of sight as it made 
the bend to the freeway. The old woman was sitting 
now and was sifting through the Saks bag. The clink 
of glass and the wild·fire rustle of papers came from 
inside. She leaned over and spat again. The wad was 
browner this time. 

"Gross me out" Marquez repeated, "mClde me 
miss my ride. What the hell you chewing on?" The 
old woman reached inside her jacket and produced 
what looked like a square of brown cheese wrapped 
in cellophane, which was tom open at one end. She 
peeled back the plastic and took a bite from the 
brown bar, and began to chew it rapidly. Her teeth 
were yellow, full of holes and wear marks. A 
smattering of dark stains showed on the upper row. 

She smiled as she chewed and offered Marquez some 
of the bar. He took it and read the red and blue 
wrapper: " FAVO RI TE SON CHEWING 
TOBACCO, FEATURING THE CHOICEST 
BLENDS OF DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED 
HERBS FOR YOUR CHEWING ENJOYMENT." 
This ain't no chocolate bar, he thought. 

"Gross me out. How'd you take up with this stuff?" 
He turned around and looked at the intersection. A 

hefty clump of cars weTf~ waiting at the light. Standing 
up straight, adjusting his jacket and smoothing back 
his hair with the flat of his hands, he stuck out his 
thumb straighter than he'd done since that afternoon, 
when he'd hitched to Balboa Park from Mission 
Beach. The straightness of the thumb and the arm 
died after the light changed. As most of the cars 
turned left or right on University, he felt a tremendous 
weight in the ann . The thumb curled up like a leaf and 
the arm sank slowly, as though his arm were a barrier 
being lowered at the railroad crossing. Three of the 
cars did take the freeway, a green VW with a fish 
emblem bumpersticker, a limosine with smoke· 
colored windows and a television aerial poking out of 
the roof, and a Datsun with a dented fender that 
rubbed noisily against the tire. Behind him, he heard 
the woman rustling through the bag, and then the 
sound of suction . She 'd spat again. 

"Gross me out to the max. " He was shaking his

fist. The old woman had what looked like a photo· 
album on her lap. I t had leather covers, torn, full of 
scratches and cigarette burns, bounding the pages 
with a twined red string that had fez·like tassels on the 
ends . The pages, made of construction paper, were 
brown and cracked, and had creased black and white 
snapshots glued to them, arranged in perfect rows. 
The old woman turned the pages slowly and let her 
eyes glide over each row slowly as he continued to 
chew her cud. The sound of her chewing mixed with 
an unrecognizable melody she hummed. The 
intersection was dead. The sign reading "Hillcrest," 
which was suspended over a crosswalk down the 
street and which hadn't been lit since the late '60s, 
was a black streak against a maze of power lines, 
streetlamps and billboards . Marquez shoved his 
hands in his pocket and sat on the bench next to the 
old woman. He remembered he still had what was left 
of a bottle of Night Train Express stashed under the 
bench in a paper bag. He reached under, with a stoop 
that hurt the small of his back, and he grabbed the 
bottle. Untwisting the cap, he put the stem of the 
bottle to his lips and took a swig. The wine was warm, 
full of suspicious foam. It had the taste of bad grapes. 
The old woman spat. 

"Some?" Marquez offered her the bottle after 
rolling the bag half way down to the label. The old

woman shook her head. reached bac k inside her 
jacket. and produced a small pamphlet. He took it 
and read the bqld lettering on the front. "DON'T 
DRINK OR SMOKE. GOD'S NUMBER SEVEN 
LA W. DRINK: HARD LIVER. SMOKE: 
CANCER." He laughed and took another drink. The 
wine swillhed around the bottom of the bottle in full 
circles. 

"Okay to chew the stuff. right?" He gave the 
pamphlet back to her. She closed the album and put it 
inside the sack. There was a tearing sound. She lifted 
the sack 011 the sidewalk and put it on her lap, holding 
both sides tightly . He put the bottle to his lips for the 
last drink when he saw something familiar from the 
comer of his eye. A police car had turned the comer 
and was now parked in front of the bus stop. A cop 
got out of the car and walked up to Marquez. The cop 
had a clipboard tucked under one arm and a long· 
handled flashlight c;radled in the other. He Hashed a 
beam in hi, face. 

"Lemmee talk to you. pal" he said. Marquez 
covered hi' eyes witli one hand and gripped' the nec~ 
of the bot~e with the other. The cop's voice was not 
friendly. "First, though. I want you to put that bOllle 
on the sidewalk. Slowly." Marquez was in no mood 
to argue or stand up for his rights , He put the bottle on 
the ground and stood up . . The cop kept the flashlight 
on him. 

"What's up? asked Marquez. 
"I'd like to see your 10." Marquez reached into his 
bac~ pocket, removed hi, wallet, and opened it. He 

, 

began to give it to the cop. 
"Take it out of the wallet , please." Marquez 

nodded and pulled it from the plastic sheath, and then 
gave it to the cop. The cop placed the flashlight under 
the card. In the photo, Marquez had short hair and 
was wearing glasses. He hadn't worn his glasses 
since the frames were broken during a baseball 
game, when he was playing the outfield and blew. a 
chance to catch a pop, Hy. 

" Is this your card? ' asked the cop, "doesn 't look 
like you. Where are your glasses?" 

He put the bottle to his

saw something familiar ... 

"Don't wear 'em anymore." 
"Did you get contacts?" 
"Shit no. Costs , too much."

"Why don' t you ·get 'em fixed?" 
"Can't affOl'd it. Right now that is .. ," 
"Uh·huh." Marquez was rocking inveluntarily 

back and forth . The cop put the Oashlight back 'under 
the card. The light in his face showed the shape of a 

. block of wood. 

"Okay, Marquez. just to make sure, I want you to 
tell me what it says on the card." . 

"What. " 
"Tell me what it says on the card. Full name.

Marquez shrugged. "Marquez Louis Medina. July

"Okay '! said the cop, handing the ID back to him, 
"It's yours. The 'reason I pulled over was because I 
saw you taking a slug of that stuff." Marquez 
instinctively looked down at the bottle. "There's a 
new ordinance that's just been passed that prohibits 
drinking in the downtown area. Presently you're in 
violation of that ordinance." Marquez was going to 
say something smart but bit his lip when he saw the 
length of the flashlight handle ...... now I'm gonna 
give you a break and let you off with a warning. What 
you should do is be a little more careful about where

easily by pleading insanity. 

Despite some flaws (Karen 
"a1entine as a reporter was 
supposed to represent the role 
of the media in such events, 
but she came. out just stupid 
and ambitious), Eischied is a 
superior drama. The show 
also benefits from the acting of 
Baker (Buford Pusser in 
Walking Tall) as the 
individualistic Chief of 
Detectives , Eischied. 

.Sight unseen , Paris 
appeared to be the most 
promising of the quartet since 
it boasled the presence of 
James Earl Jones. Jones. a 
stunning stage and screen 
actor with an Oscar 
nomination to his credit. gave 
Paris a sense of class.

10 its expectations, which is not 
to say that it is bad - merely 
unimpressive. The show is 
sadly conventional and the 
scripts mediocre. Jones makes 
the best of what he is given but 
his beautifully resonant voice 
seems wasted on such cliche 
police dialogue . 

Paris, though, has some 
~Iimmers of hope. Jones is 
always a fascinating 
performer and he may be able 
to overcome the script' s 
limitations. In addition, Paris' 
relationship with his wife (Lee 
Chamberlain) and his youthful 
subordinates (Mike Warren, 
Jake Mitchell and Cecelia 
Hart being the standouts) has 
the ' potential to become 
interesting and successful. 
With some effort in the script 
department Paris could 

become a very worthwhile 
show. 

On the hopeless and wholly 
miss able side of the detective 
genre is ABC's Hart to Hort . a 
kind of updated , beautiful· 
people's version of The Thin 
Man 's Nick and Nora Charles. 
Jonathon and Jennifer Hart 
(Robert Wagn er and 
Stephanie Powers respective· 
ly) are a rich , happily married 
couple who keep falling into 
situations that requ ire 
sleuthing . The basic plot 
requirement calls for Jennifer 
to be put in jeopardy so that 
Jonathon can come to the 
rescue. The plots are stale, the 
acting artificial and the show a 
waste of time. Only veteran 
actor Lionel Stander is 
enjoyable.

James Bondian level is the spy 
adventure A Man Called 
S loane starring Robert 
Conrad. This show has fancy 
gadge ts. beautiful women. 
insane villains and a slick look. 
but it cannot match the fantasy 
adventures of James Bond , or 
even Conrad's earlier secret 
al'lent work as Jim West in The 

Wild Wild Wesl. Fortunately. 
A Man Called Sloane does nol 
take itself too seriously, so it 
can provide some diverting 
entertainment (but nothing 
else). 

In terms of quality , Eischied 
proves superior to all the 
debuting detective dramas this 
season .

forty minutes of the same 
music was recorded. since the 
only difference between the 
songs are the words. 

John's remake of "Johnny 
B. Goode" seems about live 
minutes too long and about ten 
times too slow. If a disco piece 
could ever sound slow. this is 
it. An ori~inally upb~at rock 

and roll song is retarded to the 
incessant beat that character· 
izes all of the record. 

Upon turning the record 
over. one might expect some 
variation on the music. But no, 
the same mind.wrenching 
sound is still there. 

With luck. John's . next 
album will be one that is nol so 
soon forgotten.

16 The Datly Guardian Friday, OctOOO1' 26, 19?!)

COORS asks the question: 

What if Napoleon had been 6' 2" ? 
Imagine how the cour of history 
might have chang d if that extra 
height had meant extra ability, more 
power to be victorious! 
, The capital of the U. . might 
be New Orlean. You might be 
flunking Engli h in tead of French. 
Eating frog' legs at a Burger Roi. 
And growing up t learn about 
Engli h perfume, Engli h postcard,s;.)./' 
and English ki ses. · ~f~tl' ...... 1IICI!7 

Had Napoleon been a f ot 
taller, his chest would have been , 
12 inches higher. Then his mo t 
famous pose might have under, 
shot the mark and gone down in 
history as an ob cene gesture. 

Even if he had still lost at 
Waterlo'O, Wellington might have 
figured that Elba was too small 
for Napoleon, put him on Sicily '·' 
and then, instead of the kiss of 
death, the Mafia might have been 
handing' out French kiss . 

What's that got to do with 
Coors Beer? Not much. But think 
about this-what if Coors Beer 
weren't 'brewed up in the high 
country? Then it wouldn't be the 
only beer brewed with pure Rocky 
Mountain !1ring water and special 
high country barley. It would 
be city beer like all the others. 

But luckily for beer lovers, it's not. 
It's Coors. And you can 
Taste the High Country. 
Vive Ie Coors! 

Taste the 
High Country.
